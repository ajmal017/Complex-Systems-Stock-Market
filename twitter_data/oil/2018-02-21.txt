2 2018-02-21 23:59:23 You're an economic genius mate and clearly an oil and gas industry expert. Thank God we've got you to keep us straight.
3 2018-02-21 23:59:08 Can confirm. Back in my sandwich artist days, they were the first to complain if they didn't get the proper ratio of mayo to oil and vinegar. And never ask them if they'd like sandwich with their mayonnaise.
4 2018-02-21 23:58:57 So what alyuh use? Mud? Oil? Markers?!
5 2018-02-21 23:58:34 Guys guys, have we, and hear me out here, tried praying for another oil boom?
6 2018-02-21 23:58:30 I.doe think this oil story is true. But I waiting

9 2018-02-21 23:58:12 When I had the flu I used peppermint oil to lower the fever!  It worked fantastically!
10 2018-02-21 23:58:12 Your granny let any ol' paddy climb up on her did she? 
11 2018-02-21 23:58:11 OIL PAINT IS SO DIFFERENT FROM ACRYLIC but one things in common: i cant paint a gray scale in either
12 2018-02-21 23:57:50 In point 2: oil lube can make silicone porous (what the fuck?)
In point 3: 'natural lube already exists'. You suggest the brand Yes. Yes makes an oil based lube
In point 7: things being"too slick" can cause tears. That's ridiculous.
Concise enough?

16 2018-02-21 23:57:03 Actually.... BC receives $5.7billion, 8 other provinces receive $21.6Billion to split. Also BC receives $922million/yr in municipal tax benefits. On top of that, it will also supply more oil to the Burnaby refinery, helping to reduce the cost of fuel overall.
17 2018-02-21 23:56:57 Odd, 70% of Venezuela's gdp comes from the private sector, Public sector is 30% because it contains oil production.

38 2018-02-21 23:56:41 Totally agree, many factors are effecting the ability to source heavy oil, not completely related to Canada, but it is ome factor.
39 2018-02-21 23:56:40 Looks like Silver chart from 2013 after QE 3 was announced. Who was that Silver Oil selling wave counter? Ah yes...
40 2018-02-21 23:56:35 He did a good job.
41 2018-02-21 23:56:31 That has happened from time to time as well but I would be surprised if this gear oil was on back order.
42 2018-02-21 23:56:27 I did it. You can too.
43 2018-02-21 23:56:21 We get it @TheDemocrats are going to try & run on gun control, but what abt the REST of the issues? Ones we’ve already been in the streets about. Will they do ANYTHING else? #DACA, Single Payer, Police, Living Wage, Big Oil, Net Neutrality etc...  .@CecileRichards #TheBeat
44 2018-02-21 23:56:18 Why not olive oil? That's what I use.

59 2018-02-21 23:54:05 I have said 47 times today: oil does not ruin silicone toys. 
I'm not wasting any more of my time on you. You can read my tweets. You can read my lube guide. My article about porous toys and bad lubes and vag infections where I ref'd a study. Not hand holding now. NO.

61 2018-02-21 23:54:00 I’ve had them my whole life. I always try the holistic peppermint oil route first when it starts to come on but if it’s real bad I have to use meds. I’ve had the best luck with imitrex nasal shots and my back up is fioricet.
62 2018-02-21 23:53:59 It hasnt with me im not sure about other people but my friends all swear by coconut oil too
63 2018-02-21 23:53:56 The chinese own that oil already. I ain't even gonna get all hyped up about it.

69 2018-02-21 23:53:15 Sadly, they aren't the first and won't be the last.  Big oil (now little oil) hurts us all...every type of business has been adversely affected in the downturn.
'Last one out, turn out the lights'
70 2018-02-21 23:53:14 pennies compared to the money behind big oil.
71 2018-02-21 23:53:14 If you're considering investing in oil and gas drilling because of a radio ad, just send me a check directly. I offer a much more efficient way to drain funds from your bank account.
72 2018-02-21 23:53:05 Baby oil, everything
73 2018-02-21 23:53:01 Traffic sucks man. Screw dallas sometimes. Or all the time. Man I’m homegrown. And people in midland complain about traffic with all the oil business lol
74 2018-02-21 23:52:56 Yes, and I'm a guy who has worked in the Texas and California oil patches. I've sat across the lunch table and debated NRA members in Bakersfield and Midland...and even those hair raising experiences didn't prepare me for the debate over arming American teachers.
75 2018-02-21 23:52:55 I don't think he denies it, i think he believes that cost in human lives in West Africa and monetary cost to USA and the immigration cost is not acceptable. The oil thing which is causing chain reaction could easily be solve.
76 2018-02-21 23:52:50 Day 1 of my hair being cleansed with coconut oil and milk shampoo. All I have to say is it's pretty amazing.
77 2018-02-21 23:52:39 Me making cupcakes...                              Directions: 1 1/2 tbsp of oil.                        Me: 1 1/2 CUPS of oil  wow.
78 2018-02-21 23:52:37 Treating myself to ice cream when i get off. And parking in the back of my building where I’ll prolly get a ticket. But i have an oil change appointment so that’s fine 
79 2018-02-21 23:52:30 You mean the same guy that when oil dropped to $26 , said we wouldn’t see oil hit $40 again in his leftime?  He is a bozo
80 2018-02-21 23:52:21 "And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out." ~Matthew 25:8 #Bible
81 2018-02-21 23:52:00 you mean 17 million of them? Mostly are not idiots... a few that knew what they were voting for, others (the majority) just simply ignorant or misled by snake oil salesmen (brexiteers) and a minority downright stupid and/or racist and xenophobic
82 2018-02-21 23:51:55 Me: "The genie bottle light came on in my car."
Mom: "That would be the oil light."
83 2018-02-21 23:51:52 Without the olive oil

85 2018-02-21 23:51:41 Trudeau is just like his father. Me,me,me!!
He has no concept of real life situations. His tiny Billion$ find in India does absolutely nothing for our real problems at home. Stay home and deal with our oil issues!! What an embarrassment for Canada!!!!
86 2018-02-21 23:51:40 There's always always investing/shorting oil company shares and more tricky things with oil markets, ETFs etc. But energy is extremely volatile over short/medium term - this is more of a a long-term bet. So, it would be challenging.
87 2018-02-21 23:51:04 Cant believe are being so negative about #petro when its sole purpose is to reclaim sovereignty through a commodity backed currency that could help them break free of Western oil company hegemony, US sanctions are helping impoverish this country, takes balls to try this!

90 2018-02-21 23:50:50 It's not only ocean plastics. We all need to stand firm against off-shore oil drilling.

Unemployment has already dropped to 4.1%, food stamps cut in half, minority unemployment at lowest levels in history, we’re exporting more coal/oil and natural gas,businesses with their billions are repatriating bc of business friendly
94 2018-02-21 23:50:21 Es bueno saber que los empleados de Oil Combustibles mantendrá los puestos de trabajo. Acompañamos a las familias sanlorencinas y del cordón industrial.
95 2018-02-21 23:50:00 And we’ll say it again: we do not recommend coconut oil as lube. Just like we don’t recommend using petroleum jelly. Or butter (and yes, we have customers who do).
96 2018-02-21 23:49:59 Oh...and oil changes
97 2018-02-21 23:49:39 What are you attempting to achieve for your readers in posting? To dissuade them from using coconut oil as lube, yes? By listing reasons? Presented as facts? That sounds a lot like education to me
98 2018-02-21 23:49:38 Good point--I imagine not oil... That's a good "Stump the Docent" or "Pointlessly Ask A Guard" question.
99 2018-02-21 23:49:26 The Lake Louise oil spill is inevitable then.
100 2018-02-21 23:49:19 Try an essential oil blend for relaxation

104 2018-02-21 23:48:57 Bookmarked it. I don't care about no dairy. Will probably use sour cream. Don't like coconut oil. I can adapt this.
105 2018-02-21 23:48:52 Drink some of that oil and see God
106 2018-02-21 23:48:48 Yall I put coconut oil in my hair and it’s the best it’s ever looked. Most people say it does nothing for their hair.
107 2018-02-21 23:48:40 As a biofuel #algae is the fuel to use cause it produces so much crude oil per harvest. No other plant can compare. Many producers however, find more profit from the food/pharmaceutical sector crazily enough.
108 2018-02-21 23:48:28 I heard coconut oil clogs up your pores
109 2018-02-21 23:48:06 Soak hands in warm olive oil once a week for strong nails and youthful looking hands.
110 2018-02-21 23:48:02 It's basically cod lover oil and some other concoctions but I guarantee I'll be better in no time
111 2018-02-21 23:47:43 oil can harry barrel scene
112 2018-02-21 23:47:33 Unemployment low. Profits high market up. No sought even Alberta fine with low oil prices. JT likes to spend but not tax. Like saying I like to drink I just don't like to pay for it. Time to raise taxes on affluent.
113 2018-02-21 23:47:31 No. Is the simple answer. A member of staff, who uses coconut oil for things other than lubrication, asked to write about it. We agreed. We liked the blog post written. We published it. As a team we agree: we do not recommend coconut oil as lube.
114 2018-02-21 23:47:25 Thank God for my dad always doing my oil changes cause not down to pay $150 lmao
115 2018-02-21 23:47:21 Avoid plastic, and palm oil. Being a vegetarian, recycling, beach cleaning. Donating to 4ocean, paying carbon tax, donating to carbonfund to plant trees.
116 2018-02-21 23:47:13 I’m going way out of my goddamn comfort zone and getting a professional back massage tomorrow by someone who will use my cbd/thc oil. This will either be the worst thing or an at least helpful thing but probably still weird.
117 2018-02-21 23:46:55 Ugh skin issues are hard. Do you add any oils to your horse’s grain? Might need additional vitamin E and some people swear by 2T of coconut/canola/olive oil per feeding.
118 2018-02-21 23:46:42 coconut oil and tea tree oil wipes are doing the most for my skin atm!!
119 2018-02-21 23:46:38 Just another showman, like yourself, selling snake oil.
120 2018-02-21 23:46:33 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
121 2018-02-21 23:46:29 I don’t think I had that much oil on my face until I had an actual conversation on the phone, we wouldn’t know because none of use it to talk anyway.
122 2018-02-21 23:46:29 That they can then ruin themselves with oil spills and ships sinking.
123 2018-02-21 23:46:25 A famous KW vanity plate on a Tesla is “OIL LOL”
124 2018-02-21 23:46:13 Oil has been found off the shore of Jamaica. Interesting
125 2018-02-21 23:46:10 I have an image... America using oil for everything. Lamps, trains, candles, etc.
126 2018-02-21 23:45:24 there was soap in the oil.... idk how it got there
127 2018-02-21 23:45:03 try african black soap! it’s amazing. once you wash your face with that, use rosehip oil
128 2018-02-21 23:45:01 Food prices? If the price of ethanol and corn are the same before the RFS, how does either get the blame?! Assume the billions to oil is ok, as is military protecting supply lines, etc?!
129 2018-02-21 23:45:00 And maybe instead of poison the dilophosaurus could spit baby oil. That would be extremely helpful

156 2018-02-21 23:41:14 Listen, all I want is an oil change. Not a lecture on car maintenance. I’m fucking here aren’t I??
157 2018-02-21 23:40:52 OIL BRENT US$65.4/bbl +0.5%. Kraken Production Boon Spurs North Sea Oil Industry.
158 2018-02-21 23:40:51 Went in for an oil change and left with a sheet telling me about $600 worth of stuff I have to get done and a new fear that my steering wheel finna pop off my tires every time I make a turn
159 2018-02-21 23:40:50 Venezuela is the first country to have its own cryptocurrency and it’s backed up by oil. That’s insane.

162 2018-02-21 23:40:25 Just got a oil change and at the end the guy looks at me and says “I’m a magician, tell all your friends” wtf
163 2018-02-21 23:40:23 Question...  I put mink oil on my new Ralph Lauren Polo boots.
How do I remove the mink oil?

168 2018-02-21 23:39:52 protecting oceans from plastic is good. Protection from oil spills is also important. Stop #KinderMorgan expansion and the threat from those extra  tankers.
169 2018-02-21 23:39:47 my amanso guapo shipped. my cuculmeca is on the way. i think i'm just about done with this new oil recipe.
170 2018-02-21 23:39:43 Hmmmm...Alcatraz. How ironic that you should find yourself there considering  it’s history. Are you searching for more Native Americans to remove by force? Or perhaps you are just checking in? Maybe a sweet spot for oil rigs?
171 2018-02-21 23:39:38 tonight i slow roasted sweet potato, broccoli, red peppers, and garlic!!! i drizzled sesame oil all over them and rubbed cumin seeds, coriander, garam masala, garlic powder & cayenne pepper on them and they smelled INCREDIBLE !!!!!!
172 2018-02-21 23:39:29 It’s absurd Alberta is going after the wine growers whom probably support pipelines, turn the oil off to the lower mainland, hurt the ones that are the problem
173 2018-02-21 23:39:26 the best part of beau jest is the scene where oil can harry
174 2018-02-21 23:39:26 This oil situation should’ve been kept quiet until we already had deals for export signed sealed & delivered.
175 2018-02-21 23:39:03 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot

177 2018-02-21 23:38:40 You’re hopeless, what the NRA ‘donates’ is peanuts compared to foreign ‘oil’ money donated to Democrats . Members of the NRA donate not the NRA comparatively and to sit there and say the Republicans are bought by the NRA is completely false
178 2018-02-21 23:38:30 @joybauer The salad spot at work doesn't always have beans, and I want to keep my salad vegetarian. Can I use 3-4 eggs for protein on a salad containing a large amount of greens & other non-starchy vegetables and only 1-2 tsp of olive oil?
179 2018-02-21 23:38:29 So you think deforestation, population of waterways/lakes/oceans, oil spills, toxic air, shrinking polar ice caps, wild weather patterns, rising sea levels, overflowing landfills, unusable land/soil, animals going extinct and coal burning are all nice things?

181 2018-02-21 23:38:02 As a team, our consensus is that coconut oil should not go in or on genitals or sex toys - at this point, this will not change. We understand others may feel differently, this will also not change. However, we will pull the article 1/2

183 2018-02-21 23:38:01 Found out they sell Charlottes Web oil in the UK. Cheapest bottle is £40. I can't afford it.

198 2018-02-21 23:36:11 I can’t find it  it had light brown sugar, raisins, carrots  self raising flour, nutmeg and a touch of cinnamon, baking powder, orange grated and sunflower oil.
199 2018-02-21 23:36:04 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

201 2018-02-21 23:35:53 @am640 who's this John guy on the air? I'm sure he owns tons of oil and building stocks. Open up greenbelt for more construction? Really?   Expand oil extraction? Thank god conservatives won't be elected any time soon.

208 2018-02-21 23:34:53 I hope it helps. Someone else has suggested hemp oil.
209 2018-02-21 23:34:48  Have you ever used that fur oil before? I didn't know such a product existed, and now I'm super curious how easily I can justify the impulse-buy 
210 2018-02-21 23:34:25 Silicone sex toys will not be destroyed or harmed from oil-based lubes. Until people started talking about coconut oil as a lube or companies like @sliquid and @coconu started making plant-oil-based lubes, the existing ones on market weren't vag-friendly.
211 2018-02-21 23:34:04 LOL. I had to research what beard oil and balm are. But at the rate that it's growing, I expect that the old-wise-asian bearded man look I'm going for won't happen until 2025.
212 2018-02-21 23:33:57 #IPWeek2018 Day 3:
• Would 2019 be weaker than 2018? Some traders believe so as they see US shale growing strongly again and demand growth slowing  
• IEA will offer its first view on 2019 S/D balances in a few days (March 5). Some expects a bearish outlook

213 2018-02-21 23:33:53 There is a grease fire. I know lets throw more fucking oil on it.
214 2018-02-21 23:33:50 Like I know it sucks for Albert right now. I feel bad for the citizens of Alberta. But the price of oil plummeted, that's the market. Not the govt. Those high paying oil jobs aren't coming back no matter who is in office. You've had great job growth in Alberta, but they're

218 2018-02-21 23:33:26 Did a great many tests with obs today and they were all very fun. I appologize for the crazy at the end of the last one. My middle two each have a different form of autism a d some days it can be like fire and oil. It scares me. I worry for them. We will persevere.

220 2018-02-21 23:33:12 Fair enough. Perhaps I'm mistaken about seeing anyone specifically saying that oil and silicone don't mix

225 2018-02-21 23:32:18 I'm disputing the claim that men today have lower testosterone levels than people 50 years ago, like the radio ad claimed.  The point is that there's an obsession with hypermasculinity, as exemplified by snake oil salesmen playing off these made up fears via radio ads
226 2018-02-21 23:32:18 sounds like crude oil
227 2018-02-21 23:32:14 ManU of course.

231 2018-02-21 23:31:52 yes indeed. A few rust spots in the back above the wheels is all that needs looking at, mint apart from that. Not bad for a car from 2003. Still the oil comes out like honey when changing it.

234 2018-02-21 23:31:26 You're comparing chalk & cheese Matt. Noisy neighbours also have unlimited oil £££ behind them vs Utd organic income (& Glazer debt ). Yes Utd can still spend but not on that level. That's the difference. Wenger was 100% right about  killing competition in the game
235 2018-02-21 23:31:24 This is despite the reality being the opposite.

The Scottish Government could force oil companies to ship Greenfield work up to Aberdeen instead of giving it to London based engineering companies.

It's likely those oil companies would have to make Aberdeen their Europe & ME HQ.
236 2018-02-21 23:31:19 Trying to look like i’m doing something important standing outside the train station but im just really listening to hawthorne heights & hitting my oil pen in preparation for my commute home
237 2018-02-21 23:31:18 Ironically the the trophies are in the Metro Energy Oil window, The other 2 are in front of @stapletonfloral. Picked a good time to get a haircut.
238 2018-02-21 23:31:16 I spend/waste my time starting new oil paintings in attempts to avoid heavy loads of work and convince myself im dong something productive when really everyone's sister and their grandma knows im not gonna finish it & I could've finished my work by the time I start a new one

243 2018-02-21 23:30:47 What do you think the proxy war in Syria is all about? Oil and gas pipelines into Europe. That prevention you speak of is far from over

252 2018-02-21 23:29:47 Why do you allow imports of oil into eastern Canada then. And will you stop raw sewage being pumped into St.Lawrence and west coast
253 2018-02-21 23:29:44 Olive oil as a seasoning Twitter is at its again 
254 2018-02-21 23:29:38 teatree oil and water or salt and water solution can help clean it 
255 2018-02-21 23:29:37 When they say "only water based" it's because the usual other option is silicone based and they're taking the safe route, since most don't want to risk the chance that silicone lube would be absorbed into the silicone toy. I don't know anyone saying not to mix oil and silicone.
256 2018-02-21 23:29:28 Back when I was in college, 1974, there was a huge lavender book on OPEC, & why Nixon signed it. I don't recall its title. I do remember his strategy: 1st use up Middle East oil, which then they forecasted as having 25 years' reserves. Does that sound familiar?
257 2018-02-21 23:29:24 A true message for British Columbia would be to show a tanker leaking oil with the message:  "B.C.:  Take one for the team."
258 2018-02-21 23:29:09 Following too swebs!
259 2018-02-21 23:29:03 You have got to threaten to vote these animal haters out of Office if they don’t stop killing your beautiful wildlife from the wild horses,wolves & bears now the bison these animals will be gone,what they want more land for the oil companies?
260 2018-02-21 23:29:01 It happens because it keeps happening and coz so much money in the market is trendfollowing. It's a negative feedback loop. You have gone from discounting a higher oil price than spot to discounting a long term price in the 40's. Beyond a trade this is severe undervaluation .
261 2018-02-21 23:28:58 And while I get that oil can't be good for vaginal flora, surely it's perfect for anal? Yet that's also specifically cautioned against
262 2018-02-21 23:28:57 The same goes for big pharma, oil, insurance and the list could go on.  Lobbying in US government has these groups pulling the strings of legislation.  ...Your politicians are their puppets controlled with big corporate money.  Policy change is needed, or it going to get worse.
263 2018-02-21 23:28:16 O shit. Uncle Sam just declared that Duterte is a threat to democracy in South East Asia. We gonna get freedomed so hard.

America plis no, we dun habe da oil
264 2018-02-21 23:28:08 I feel so sad for her. It must be difficult to be so angry all the time. Is she married? Can you imagine her at holiday dinners? Dear God.
265 2018-02-21 23:28:04 And wait until you see the Korean US Nuclear war.  I said I hated GW.  But I would take him any day over someone who would use the Football because his feelings are hurt.  We all know that was oil.  We all know we shouldn't have gone.  But this one will be "He called me fat"
266 2018-02-21 23:27:56 Venezuelan Petro ICO:

267 2018-02-21 23:27:51 Sunblock? At that time there were probably more people applying baby oil to "tan" faster.

269 2018-02-21 23:27:45 I have noticed that lots of bloggers in the blog squad say not to use oil based lube with silicone, or imply it by saying to only use water based with silicone

271 2018-02-21 23:27:13 And Trump sold Ukraine anti tank missiles to be used against Russian tanks (Obama refused to do that). Sold Ukraine coal that had been cut off by Russia. Opened up energy production in the US that cuts into the price of oil, hence Petro-state Russia makes less money. Killed an un

273 2018-02-21 23:26:43 But obviously not from the peasants. I like to put things in context. Buhari has overwhelming support in the north. But is the south south happy about their oil being taken? Is their claim for control of their oil illegitimate? I would try to read your sources and get back to you
274 2018-02-21 23:26:41 Obama retains oil sanctions against Iran, dashes Pakistan’s hopes
275 2018-02-21 23:26:39 You can be the only person here just to get an oil change and they still going to take 3 hours 
276 2018-02-21 23:26:37 Saudi, US, or Iraqui oil like the majority of Canadians. Our 5% domestic use is the same as our 5% Chinese imports.
277 2018-02-21 23:26:30 Haha! Mass school shooters always losers, always leftist, always pot users.
278 2018-02-21 23:26:24 Teachers, let's not forget how your salary, benefits and retirement is paid for.
Let's not forget how your generous Defined Benefit pension, which was underfunded, was 'topped up'.
Let's also consider where the $ came from to hire Suzuki.

Oil and Gas royalty income to Alberta!!
279 2018-02-21 23:26:11 We in NOLA and there’s breaking news, our faces DO produce oil. The argument between us and our skin was an argument misplaced. It was really meant to be between us and the frigid north-woods. #apology #faceapology #selflove #loveyoself

285 2018-02-21 23:24:31 They have the money why not. At least Albertans know the value of oil and not ignorance is bliss like Vancouverites.
286 2018-02-21 23:24:13 Nothing like a nice 11 hour work day before coming home to change the oil in the box truck so i can wake up at 530 and shoot 70 miles up the parkway. Mechanic had two guys out with the flu and had to cancel my appointment today

293 2018-02-21 23:23:30 Thanks. Of course, I forgot something and had to pull it out of the oven two min in to oil and herb it. I used the Paul Hollywood recipe because I didn’t plan ahead.
294 2018-02-21 23:23:17 But deficit spending isn't a major concern. ISIS being allowed back in is a charter issue... and widely widely overblown. Good, phase out the tar sands... Oil is going the way of the dodo bird and the price is only going to continue to drop and eventually be unprofitable anyway
295 2018-02-21 23:23:09 You dont add oil my dude
296 2018-02-21 23:23:05 I need to get an oil change this weekend
297 2018-02-21 23:23:01 Coconut oil will not destroy silicone. 

Full stop. 

Yet you kept that.
298 2018-02-21 23:22:53 There may, just maybe, have been other, less violent, civilian harming options for The Revolution besides destroying a city with US air strikes, than seizing oil fileds, in the context of broader local, national, regional and global violence by the US Empire?

302 2018-02-21 23:22:34 I've yet to find someone using an actual silicone sex toy who experienced material destruction of any type from using oil lubes. No oil-based lube manufacturer cautions against using their lubes with silicone toys. @SmittenKittenMN Lube Info also says oil is safe w silicone.

306 2018-02-21 23:21:53 That would be awesome! I did the oil drop experiment in high school, they should have also taught how the first one was inaccurate, and how the subsequent ones were also a tiny bit fraudulent.
307 2018-02-21 23:21:50 She's already got a spatula and hot oil. What else would she need?
308 2018-02-21 23:21:42 Tax cuts that's resulted in bonuses for employees and companies investing money in expanding. Isis territory has diminished massively. Regulations have been peeled away that hurt coal companies and oil companies. 3%GDP growth (which Obama said was a dream). He's doing fine.

317 2018-02-21 23:20:15 Ask the veterans protesting?  M103 will be passed into a law. That’s how it starts. He said he wanted to phase out the oil sands.
318 2018-02-21 23:20:08 I was going to say concert tickets & VIPs then realized some artists tickets & VIPs are just way to high for me.  

I think most things would price out for me so out of necessity gas for my car & oil for my house

324 2018-02-21 23:19:20 Unaprol. Isn't that the organisation apparently dedicated to the  miraculous conversion hundreds of thousands of tonnes of cheaper Spanish olive oil into Italian every year? The oil version of turning water into wine, except way better because Jesus did it only once.

369 2018-02-21 23:12:59 What a shame!  An oil producing nation spending so much to import refined product probably from her exported crude oil.
370 2018-02-21 23:12:58 Oil changes on your car makes a huge difference boy!
371 2018-02-21 23:12:48 People really put coconut oil on their faces... I thought it was a joke
372 2018-02-21 23:12:36 Yeah, maybe they were both into prostitutes. Impossible, since Reverend Graham was about as different from traitor Trump as oil is from water.
373 2018-02-21 23:12:33 Yes, veg oil consumption seems to have gone up by about 150% in the last 20 or so years. Obviously the population has grown too, but by nowhere near that much.
374 2018-02-21 23:12:30 Youve been reduced to a sheep & trying to tell us you did it willingly. You bore me
375 2018-02-21 23:12:30 Don't forget the coconut oil 
376 2018-02-21 23:12:19 Been reading "The Attention Merchants", and it begins with origin of selling snake oil and "patent medicines" that claim to cure all sorts of things. Aspirin, with all the things it really can help with, sounds like a patent medicine.

381 2018-02-21 23:12:02 I'm having no luck lately in the kitchen

382 2018-02-21 23:11:51 Oh there's a snarky footnote? How adult of them. 

Yep. Most silicone toys are food grade and yes JUST LIKE COOKWARE they play very well with oil. Med and food grade are still the same silicone basically. Just one paid for FDA testing.
383 2018-02-21 23:11:49 Finally purchased Rosehip oil.

403 2018-02-21 23:10:00 Just to confirm, because I seem to find different info everywhere, but silicone and oil play just fine, right? Like silicone cookware? 
I would assume that not all cookware is medical grade, as food grade is its own class, despite Sh's snarky new footnote

429 2018-02-21 23:07:13 This reminds me of years ago when I worked at a movie theater, we’d make “heart attack” popcorn which was regular popcorn but with like 4 or 5 times the oil and salt. It was magical.

436 2018-02-21 23:05:41 Compelling solutions lead to complacency; complacency leads to lock-in; lock-in leads to price fixing; eventually somebody finds a niche that justifies a different approach. 

Or to phrase it another way, one day oil will be so expensive that somebody will invent Uber for horses.

444 2018-02-21 23:04:17 The priest must sacrifice the dead animal. It is a burnt offering. The priest must offer it on the altar. He must burn the flour and the oil with it on the altar. All this will make atonement for the person. This makes the person who had the illness clean.

445 2018-02-21 23:04:10 Make tickets free. Charge to oil them up.
446 2018-02-21 23:03:58 Technically, they never fixed 9/11. They just did a repugnant party mislead to other problems... Scaring people with "weapons of mass distruction" next. Attacked them for oil. Gas prices since, have NEVER gone down. As the oil companies, INCLUDING which the bush family OWN. $$$
447 2018-02-21 23:03:43 It really looks like i have an oil stain in my phone lol
448 2018-02-21 23:03:36 So you think it's nice if the world were just run out of oil and have nothing that can replace it? And that we shouldn't start planning for such a time
449 2018-02-21 23:03:06 What about oil is natural? Where can you find 300,000 barrels of oil just being dumped into the ocean? Spoiler alert: that's not natural. What a shil!
450 2018-02-21 23:03:02 Let’s be honest.....99% of the anti-gun high school protesters don’t even know how to check the oil in their vehicles. What they experienced was tragic, but teens don’t know enough about life to demand we change the Constitution.
451 2018-02-21 23:02:59 The keyboards we are typing on currently are made of plastic, which is an oil product. Money will decrease significantly in the coming years as stronger sources of energy are developed, so it makes sense to capitalize now to finance these technological advances.

454 2018-02-21 23:02:36 In NM we don't pay school taxes, per se. It comes out of the oil/gas monies.

Of course, Santa Fe gets majority from the SE & most of it goes to Albuquerque.

As to this administration*, De Vos has cut school funding

460 2018-02-21 23:02:05 found out what hot oil and cold water does the hard way
461 2018-02-21 23:02:01 Yes, and that the means of doing so is financing the current Energy Sector. Which, unfortunately, means the use of fossil fuels until development has improved. You will find more on that in the previous links provided. Fossil fuels however is not the only use of the oil.

467 2018-02-21 23:01:22 Finding significant oil offshore could be our worst nightmare if not handled adroitly.  The real beneficiaries are often the global firms with drilling capacity.

469 2018-02-21 23:01:12 You should send them “olive oil”.
470 2018-02-21 23:01:03 Debatable.  

Kochs would probably support lifting of many govt protections for domestic oil industry which wouldn't necessarily be good for their personal interests.
471 2018-02-21 23:00:49 depends on your budget, i wash my face once in the morning twice at night once with an oil cleanser (i have oily skin doesn’t make it worse), then use liz earle to take the dirt off, khiels midnight recovery oil and moisturise x

478 2018-02-21 23:00:21 I can't buy the argument of pipelines being in the national interest. As long as there's oil to be sold, each party will argue that we need to intensifies oil and gas extraction. We can't do this in perpetuity.

480 2018-02-21 22:59:57 The policy definitely need to change which will cause Britain to go bankrupt(45% GDP) from stolen oil and resources in Biafra Jews and Christians Nation. Now you know why REFERENDUM is not allowed, from SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE. Nobody talks.

487 2018-02-21 22:59:02 That's interesting - we always check if someone has a peanut allergy before dispensing arachis oil  to them.
488 2018-02-21 22:58:55 I find it interesting that cosmetic companies tell us to pay all this money for make up remover which never fully gets make up off anyway when using coconut oil and a bit of cotton wool literally takes every last scrap of make up off and costs half the price and last for yonks!

492 2018-02-21 22:57:56 Jamaica has to ensure that any deal it makes will result in net earnings for the country. We don't have oil recovery capacity and thus the international firms who have such capacity are the real winners. We have seen this particularly in African countries.

497 2018-02-21 22:57:38 There has already been a significant investment in BB1-Z, so would be a shame to waste that completely. It would really depend on the cost of drilling a side track into KL3-4. If its not going to cost that much its worth it just to see if there is any flow.

506 2018-02-21 22:56:29 John Hockin prefers killing of foreign Gays.  Canada’s Gay friendly oil & gas at tidewater displaces dictator oil & gas from regimes that throw  off Buildings. Protesting pipelines = supporting #LGBTQ murder @vancouverpride Pls say Hi to Gay hating Horckin @VictoriaPride
507 2018-02-21 22:56:15 The oil market crashed, meaning all the programs tied to it lost funding. The crash of oil market was purposfully done through coersion and manipulation. They did the same shit to the USSR in the 80s. Chavez and Fidel were comfy, that upset the US.

510 2018-02-21 22:56:02 @RachelNotley Think outside the pipeline.  Refineries, bitumen balls, made in Canada solutions to a Canadian resource for a Canadian need.  Will more oil on the world market lead to higher prices for Alberta dilbit or lower prices for competing conventional oil?

515 2018-02-21 22:55:21 No one really knows how much oil is left on this planet. It could run out tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, 5 years, 10 years. And there's the problem. Instead of looking for something to replace it, we are doing nothing and just expecting oil to always be there
516 2018-02-21 22:55:17 Room always smells of marijuana and tea tree oil
517 2018-02-21 22:55:07 My car stayssss breaking my bank  just got a whole ass new set of tires & now I need an oil change AGAIN. Needy ass bitch
518 2018-02-21 22:55:00 there is always that messy mess of PUTIN/REX  500b  land/oil deal!  Rex was so angry at Obama for when the 1st sanctions were placed for their invasion of Ukraine -land of the oil!  They say no deal PUTIN just takes it by force!  The plot to attack trumps America  well designed
519 2018-02-21 22:54:57 In Nigeria, a ship loaded with oil went missing, a satellite disappeared into thin air, 10 dead people were appointed as Heads of Boards by the President, the National Budget was alleged to be missing, a snake was said to have swallowed missing N36m & now a monkey swallowed N70m.
520 2018-02-21 22:54:45 Ethanol makes your engine run hotter. Older cars are in trouble as are the poor people that own them. Is big oil the culprit?
521 2018-02-21 22:54:36 I thought they were busy guarding the oil

524 2018-02-21 22:54:29 I think theyre pretty gentle! Whats best for you might be hot water and a gentle toner afterwards and then an oil free moisturizer? Good luck!
525 2018-02-21 22:54:27 How many have to die in the middle east, or long does the gulf have to risk being devastated before you can see that Alberta Oil is the best for the global economy. Yes climate change is real, but no it won't be affected by Alberta providing a safe, less impactful solution.
526 2018-02-21 22:54:18 The PCs, under Danny Williams would never allow a deal between The Liberals, under Roger Grimes, and Hydro Quebec. He had Galway up his sleeve, but was too stun to understand oil markets. Now look at us. Poor cousins again!

530 2018-02-21 22:53:58 Alright. Consider yourself lucky. I dont argue with fascist trolls online, but ill make an exception for you. Chavez built the entire social service on the oil economy, which he rightfully nationalized. He lifted the poorest of venezuelans out of the gutter.

535 2018-02-21 22:53:32 Im watching meal prep videos and these ppl put cut up bell peppers, onions with chicken breast they add a lil salt, pepper and oil drizzled on top. Then they just pop it in the oven just like that, it makes me want to cry.
536 2018-02-21 22:53:32 You know those sanctions you promised putin you would lift so Rex and Exxon could get to Russia’s $500 billion in oil reserves. That’s what Obama Did and you tried to undo it. Congress had to stop you.
537 2018-02-21 22:53:26 “He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.” Proverbs 21:17 Great verse concerning discipline and finances! God’s Word is still practical for today!

540 2018-02-21 22:53:01 Your tweet is factual. One of the main reasons is because British govt will go bankrupt if you seperate Biafra Jews and Christians from them. From SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa is to steal oil.45% GDP.
541 2018-02-21 22:52:52 You seem obsessed with Israel. Israel really isn't that important to the empires of the West. Oil is. Money is.

565 2018-02-21 22:48:35 Sell more guns. Guns could be like oil; on the way out. It's boggling how many guns in the world with many of them here. Should be more dogs than guns. Star Trek, Star Wars both show futures/alt universes with plenty of guns.
566 2018-02-21 22:48:28 None. It's like the Detroit of Pennsylvania.
567 2018-02-21 22:48:09 The oil need fi disappear really. Pls.
568 2018-02-21 22:48:06 Nothing better than being covered from head to toe in crude oil
569 2018-02-21 22:47:43 No. They tax the oil industry and other exploiters of natural resources. Those taxes go into a huge fund that accrues interest. The interest and some of the fund's income is distributed to ALL permanent residents of the state. The fund is now over $60 billion.
570 2018-02-21 22:47:20 Down here? You in an Oil hole or sumn?

574 2018-02-21 22:46:23 arming teachers instead of banning guns is basically like in “armageddon” where they train oil drillers to be astronauts instead of just teaching astronauts to drill a hole

580 2018-02-21 22:45:16 The guy is shame.  Looking for beards at his age.  If e like e can drink the oil, no beards for him again in the life..

585 2018-02-21 22:44:14 If China generates over 100gw from solar
Am sure sub Saharan Africa can afford that if not in cash by trading mineral resources & oil
Solar is cheaper than enerfy plants in the long run
586 2018-02-21 22:44:12 You seriously think BC doesn’t benefit? That’s delusional. Thousands of jobs in BC are tied to the Oil industry. And not to mention the other industries from Albertans visiting B.C.
587 2018-02-21 22:44:09 On the cost side, the report also takes issue with Kinder Morgan's numbers. The company's most expensive spill scenario puts the cost at $100 million to $300 million. Goodman and Simon Fraser figure it would be in the "multibillion-dollar range" if oil spills in a populated area.

592 2018-02-21 22:43:30 It is still ongoing as their govt solution is catch and release. Check up on their news. This is the only way British govt can steal oil from the Country from SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians. Research.

597 2018-02-21 22:42:10 Thanks Trevor! I liked your idea for an XLB. Especially the fights. Might I suggest all fights be conducted shirtless and each team has a designated “oil girl” to grease up the fighters?
598 2018-02-21 22:41:56 Oh, nowadays we don't have such trouble anymore. No snake oil (aka virus scanners) anymore and full admin rights to our machines.
599 2018-02-21 22:41:51 no wonder there’s a baby oil shortage across the US
600 2018-02-21 22:41:49 I'm curious as to whether that one room was using incense, or oil, or what... especially since there were a lot of old/ delicate works on view, and the restrictions must have been considerable.

610 2018-02-21 22:40:01 I'm at Jiffy Lube getting my oil changed. After noticing that the price has skyrocketed since my last oil change from $36 to $54, I asked why it's shot up like that.

I was told "It's the increase in the minimum wage."

The democrats should just push the minimum wage to $30.

No questions 
No coasing when I tell tell dem bout dey job (and mudda)
No side eyes as they let me, a Jamaican Citizen with a Trini(ish) accent into their (my?) Country
656 2018-02-21 22:34:49 Okay so there’s this 6 year old kid on my bus (the bus driver’s kid) and he started telling me about his drawings and was like “Here’s a drawing of my vampire sharks” and “here’s a drawing of my blood and oil tornado!” And now I’m a bit scared.

661 2018-02-21 22:34:00 Exactly the problems of the middle East it is the source of religions, oil, human history and its location especially the Persian gulf and the red sea.
662 2018-02-21 22:33:49 Is it castor oil? It’s so good for hair growth
663 2018-02-21 22:33:44 me too! I'd also like to see him go to the Bolts, or Pens, i think he'd be a good fit there. The Blues, purely for the feel good story of it. and I'm even open to Patty and the Oil coming to a contract agreement on July for a contract that makes sense for both Him and the team.

668 2018-02-21 22:33:33 I could eat French bread or Italian bread or like semolina bread with some good olive oil all day
669 2018-02-21 22:33:29 Heard yesterday the US is exporting Oil to India as we speak
Canada's greatest success is shooting our own feet
670 2018-02-21 22:33:27 They will tell us Soon that there is no more crude oil in this country because Fish don drink am finish. #Nigeria i hail ooo
671 2018-02-21 22:33:20 Wow, Venezuela has food bank queues as long as ours- but theirs probably isn't the 6th richest economy in the world.
US sanctions really biting over there too, that'll teach them for being oil rich. Almost guarantees regime change.
672 2018-02-21 22:33:19 If it doesn’t try lavender oil on your pillow. Or look up a body scan meditation, they are honestly so good for relaxing you.

674 2018-02-21 22:33:17 The oil age will be over before we run 9ut of oil. 

We will still have maritim and offshore industries and renewable energy. We could easily supply Europe with clean energy.
675 2018-02-21 22:33:15 Oil. You are looking in the wrong place in the Middle East.
676 2018-02-21 22:32:50 Why don’t you let the grown-ups decide where to sell the oil?  The focus here is getting the opportunity to sell to someone OTHER than the USA.
677 2018-02-21 22:32:29 bike needs an oil change. And you're here about Cross and the Zodiac, yes?"
678 2018-02-21 22:32:22 It's all.funneled.out of the country where it's easier to make it disappear.
679 2018-02-21 22:32:21 ok so @MINI i LOVE you but your Santa Monica dealership is the absolute worst. i’d like to know why there’s no regular ramp? my car is stuck bc elevator broke. management is unapologetic. i also came in for an oil change and was told i need $1100 worth of repairs?
680 2018-02-21 22:32:18 “What kind of oil is it?” 
“...the cheap one?”
681 2018-02-21 22:32:10 @brexitisus Diane Abbot should keep filling her car engine with more oil and see how long it takes before it grinds to a halt.
682 2018-02-21 22:32:08 2015, the tourism industry in B.C. generated $15.7 billion in revenue...tourism contributed more to GDP than any other primary resource industry including oil & gas extraction ($7.2B), mining ($3.8B), forestry & logging ($1.9B), and agriculture & fish ($1.5B).
683 2018-02-21 22:31:55 FFS how long is it going to take the world to realise there are no meds, food & fluids in #venezuela? Where the hell is #UN et al? The world's oil richest country cannot support its innocent people. SHAME ON ALL GOVERNMENTS IN THE WORLD.

686 2018-02-21 22:31:40 Venezuela moves from oil trade to snake oil trade.
687 2018-02-21 22:31:28 Must suck to be land locked eh @rachelnotley, no big oil companies on the coast to help move your agenda along? Sad. Wonder if your govt would be inclined to subsidize an environmental clean up fund for coastal damage that the pipeline will bring?
688 2018-02-21 22:31:11 a quick prayer going out to everyone who has curly hair during this weather... keep your coconut oil close & anti friz even closer
689 2018-02-21 22:31:11 'renewable-energy' cultists wear blinkers, when it comes to the reality of alternative energy sources. Batteries, windmills, photo-voltaics all need (often exploitative) mining and processing of some rare and toxic components, plus coal/oil smelting.
It's the hypocrisy, stupid!

696 2018-02-21 22:30:40 Aside from data becoming the new oil, computing power may potentially become the new steel. The growth from CPU to GPU has been massive and usecases being leveraged are still early stage (powers AI deep learning computations, mining cryptoassets)
697 2018-02-21 22:30:14 Would be ashame of this oil was found on land the government has sold

721 2018-02-21 22:27:43 The fact that we have a French geologist discovering our oil is concerning. Maasa come back?

724 2018-02-21 22:27:25 How do I find time in a day to write a 5 page essay, conduct two interviews with summaries to follow, create three lesson plans, get an oil change, file my taxes, meet with my academic advisor, and apply for a new job? But here I am, napping with Annie.
725 2018-02-21 22:27:22 Ambition for oil is part of the root of evil my brother. That’s why the Middle East has never really seen peace
726 2018-02-21 22:26:47 Surely the #bbcnews isn’t going to dismiss the sanctions argument while talking of the troubles of #Venezuela while repeatedly mentioning the nation is oil rich. If the country was run by a rabbit buying food with oil wealth would be straightforward BUT for the #sanctions ..
727 2018-02-21 22:26:37 Must treat Venezuelan oil with imported lighter oil otherwise it is useless
728 2018-02-21 22:26:35 Nice find, and curious that Turkey's oil people are happy to do business with Kurds!
729 2018-02-21 22:26:31 The NRA is an organization made up of 5 million members who pay dues.  Even if your number were accurate, that comes to $6/person.  A bit more grassroots than a commercial association of automakers or oil producers, don't you think?
730 2018-02-21 22:26:25 Oil rich but little food or medicine in Venezuela. Powerful and incredibly sad report from @vlad_hernandez_ on #BBCNewsTen Awful images of stunted, malnourished children.
731 2018-02-21 22:26:11 much stronger cbd:THC oil goes to patients for under $50 for the same amount. At LP strength it would only cost $15-$20.

737 2018-02-21 22:25:40 Last year, you were able to buy them in Ford Hall before the game as well - hoping that's the case again.
738 2018-02-21 22:25:32 Venezuela Corbyn's shining example of socialism!
It's collapsing into the abyss no food, rampant inflation, no health service, family's starving to death!
Yet the country is the largest oil producer in the world.
Gross mismanagement by Socialist dogma.
QED
739 2018-02-21 22:25:30 They have the magic to completely reverse all harm, do they? All that oil money buy them a flux capacitor? Point I'm making is this is a foolish plan DOOMED and guaranteed to fail. The line WILL LEAK.
740 2018-02-21 22:25:14 feels good to be able to walk into holland and barrett and buy my nan cbd oil ngl

Largest oil reserve in the world.
17% children suffering malnutrition!!!
742 2018-02-21 22:25:09 The oil industry knew since the 70s climate change was a severe threat to the planet, yet suppressed research and funded climate change denier organizations. And now to save the climate plan to deal with this disaster, we have to give oil companies exactly what they want? No way.

749 2018-02-21 22:24:34 No. I agree with you. I add just a little oil to suppress the bubbling froth. :-)

Not olive oil though. Just the cheaper stuff.
750 2018-02-21 22:24:20 Is there any way to buy them if you can’t go to the game tomorrow?

753 2018-02-21 22:24:06 All you Corbynites take note, Venezuela biggest oil reserves in the world, Socialist State, super markets empty, people starving.
754 2018-02-21 22:23:37 I love olive oil for my skin but damn  got a bitch greasy
755 2018-02-21 22:23:22 Federalism as espoused by some, has it's challenges as well.  It's all about states rights, except when it's not politically expedient to do so.  So we get federal off-shore oil leasing, except in Florida, because, well you know, tourists. FYI, Calif. tourism is billions larger.

773 2018-02-21 22:22:01 I think there was both a lot of money and a lot of freedom-with-the-idea-that-it-might-turn-into-more-money during the 2008-2011ish era, plus the total assumption that pre oil crisis production was cheap & established

777 2018-02-21 22:21:39 My neighbor put my onto using coconut oil instead of lotion today. I’m not going back to lotion, I smell fucking delicious.
778 2018-02-21 22:21:38 Nope, I'm in "The Colonies," but I spent several years in Drumwhackett near Aberdeen and Dublin while my Irish American dad worked on the offshore oil rig in the North Sea.
779 2018-02-21 22:21:37 I agree that what the West (not just the UK) is doing now is not right. They are maneuvering against China and trying to get their hands on Myanmar oil and investment opportunities. 
UK is carrying water for oil interests and Soros.
780 2018-02-21 22:21:35 Got my oil changed on my car and purchased a brand new Apple Watch Series 3. Not a bad way to start my day off

785 2018-02-21 22:20:56 In other words, government contractors. The same ones who left the military after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and went to work for places like TigerSwan where they could spy on their fellow Americans for big oil. Yeah, that's what we need. Schools that look like Guantanamo.

787 2018-02-21 22:20:30 I am guessing that all three soups had a BHP inside the can. Perhaps they also had veggie

789 2018-02-21 22:20:20 I have questions. They are all oil related.
790 2018-02-21 22:20:08 In every crisis there is an opportunity for growth & innovation. Case in point: 
the oil crisis yield solar panels (thanks Exxon) 
the financial crisis yield cryptocurrencies.
791 2018-02-21 22:19:57 Odd (not really) you wouldn’t comment on the majority of oil companies (your employers) who have used their foreign funds to relentlessly influence public, politics and media in Canada for their own benefit  #cdnpoli #ableg

798 2018-02-21 22:18:37 I experienced the same, mainly in the oil and gas industry. Hence, I use an avatar online.

I wasn't even particularly vocal in 2014. I simply told clients at meetings I didn't agree with them when they brought up Salmond or Sturgeon and calling them by derogatory names.

801 2018-02-21 22:18:34 A friend made it for us. We gave Damilola to try and she ate it without mixing them yaji, oil etc. When we asked her if she liked it. Her response was she ate maggie 
802 2018-02-21 22:18:32 Yeah, does this mean the first week of school that along with the 4 boxes of Kleenex, 8 glue sticks, 20 pencils, 5 spiral notebooks, 5 single subject folders we also need to include 3 boxes of ammo, 5 shooting targets, a bottle of gun oil and 5 pairs of ear plugs? Wtf people!
803 2018-02-21 22:18:22 I smell like fried chicken all the time lately because I slather myself with emu oil.  So I know how you feel.
804 2018-02-21 22:18:18 The bauxite wasnt worth it when you consider the opprotunity cost,  however if there is oil in the cockpit country then you would be a maniac to not want to tap into that resource.
805 2018-02-21 22:18:00 I hope it will encourage big oil and other companies and organisations who need good digital communications to continue to stay in Aberdeen or relocate headquarters to Aberdeen
806 2018-02-21 22:17:55 Whoops, I put way too much oil in the popcorn popper. I can’t get it out. Should I try it anyway? Will it just be super greasy or will my house burn down? LET US FIND OUT
807 2018-02-21 22:17:52 Nothing nicer than the tingling feeling of peppermint oil in your hair
808 2018-02-21 22:17:33 @PadmaLakshmi The next City for @TopChefA3 is going to be the best competition ever. Hopefully @tomcolicchio will ban microgreens and truffle oil next season. 
809 2018-02-21 22:17:31 So do I - except it’s in a spray to limit the amount as it’s far too easy to add too much - consider that a tbsp of oil is 119 calories and Frylight is 1 cal a spray and you’d never use 119 sprays! 
810 2018-02-21 22:17:22 It’s amazing what an oil change can do to your confidence

844 2018-02-21 22:12:08 Anyway, the tax intake from oil is poor compared to other UK industries, thank fuck they're not demanding lowering tax.
845 2018-02-21 22:12:07 we have more oil than we know what to do with here in Alberta and we are forced to sell it  way below market price. The politicians ban BC wine so we cant even get drunk
846 2018-02-21 22:11:51 Try some peppermint oil or candy... it may help as you wait for the Dentist.  I tried cold packs once on the side of my jaw -but it bristled my beard something fierce.

849 2018-02-21 22:11:35 What are your thoughts on avocado/olive oil. Fried, baked, etc
850 2018-02-21 22:11:27 All the countries that have recently bought drilling land would suggest that they believe infrastructure development can be funded by oil&gas revenues.

Why didn't the U.S of A. think on the same vein?
851 2018-02-21 22:10:55 Who was it? Also, make sure you plot a bigger revenge. TP, shaving cream under the door handles, forks in the lawn and oil with confetti should do.

859 2018-02-21 22:09:33 And I've shown you its far more expensive to extract oil from UK waters and we don't produce anywhere near the amount the Norwegian do, IF its that profitable why did Swinney make a bee line to WM to insist they reduce the tax burden on the oil companies, rumbled mate.

867 2018-02-21 22:07:54 Wow, ONE armed guard for a school the size of a small college. That's like putting a teaspoon of oil in your car engine and expect it to work as well as 5-7 qts.  Train the staff (if they volunteer) like in the Miami area.  Hire volunteer retired police, sheriff deputies, etc.

870 2018-02-21 22:07:13 Let them see now
871 2018-02-21 22:07:11 Same! Lol that’s why I’m using the rose hip oil, use it at night alone and then mix a little in your moisturizer for during the day! Your face will look so much brighter!
872 2018-02-21 22:06:59 I'm not using any sprays. I cook with olive oil.
873 2018-02-21 22:06:57 UKS is an oil tanker, takes a while to turn around, also needs to be domain a way that saves political face. My take is no compromise is nearer end than beginning, but even then that's min 2yrs from now. But again I'm not talking about elite really, I'm talking general

878 2018-02-21 22:06:25 Thats a silly tater headed statement. The US isnt even ranked in the top 10 for crime or homicide. Worry about what you can control & accept the fact that youre a subject, not a free #American
879 2018-02-21 22:06:19 This isn’t the point. We are in Jan/Feb where we should be experiencing builds however, we are getting small draws or virtually no builds. This tells a lot about the oil market, what happens when demand picks up due to consumption and higher refining rates over driving season?
880 2018-02-21 22:06:17 9/11 was an op to justify pushing a highly profitable and inhumane war in the middle east. The news reported the building down BEFORE it fell. I saw it. Also to pass Patriot Act which destroyed our indi civil rights.

Now we have to go to war with Russia bc Syrian oil. Same.
881 2018-02-21 22:06:11 Not lotion! Rose hip oil!! It works so well, started using it last week religiously and I can see a huge difference! Amazon!

892 2018-02-21 22:05:04 that's different from adding the oil to the cooking water, but the easiest thing to do would be to just mix the pasta and sauce together.
893 2018-02-21 22:04:51 True. Ask Australia how their energy export is going... they tripled down on oil export and no one is buying.
894 2018-02-21 22:04:50 Same here.  Daughter is going 800+ miles away to Virginia Tech in the fall.  Thankfully, the engineering course load doesn’t have much space for social “sciences”, which I believe is where the grievance industry is incubated.

933 2018-02-21 22:01:03 First off. You complain cause Americans are getting more money. But you want companies to pay more in taxes. How do you expect companies to grow. They are taking the money and investing back into jobs. I have seen it first hand. Go sell your snake oil some where else.

993 2018-02-21 21:54:32 We’re selling our oil to the Americans at $33 / barrel, while they now export their oil to the world at $61 / barrel, and OPEC thanks its lucky stars for the obstructionism of the Canadian left.

1015 2018-02-21 21:50:27 I like to batch roast veggies-toss them w/ olive oil, S&P, minced garlic & thyme. Roast at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, stir/turn over, cook for 20 more depending on how done you like them. You can have them on sandwiches, salad, over farro w/ cheezey sauce or as is!
1016 2018-02-21 21:50:02 Maybe, maybe not. 

Maybe the busiest ports in the world actually have fewer oil spills bcuz staff are more experienced, have better equipment, etc. 

Best to be careful about assumptions that seem intuitive. Occasionally it turns out that the opposite is true.

1154 2018-02-21 21:33:47 But you're broadening the terms, it's not about homicide in general, it's about gun deaths specifically. Remove all semi-automatic weapons (forcibly or purchase) and enforce strict training and background checks for all gun ownership. Gun deaths will reduce.
1155 2018-02-21 21:33:35 You seriously expect to cap the burning oil well with a gravedigger's spade, five coconuts and a mildewed rolling paper?

1167 2018-02-21 21:33:04 No, that's when extraction stops. Mr Macron wrote on Twitter: “Very proud that France has become the first country in the world today to ban any new oil exploration licences with immediate effect and all oil extraction by 2040.”

1177 2018-02-21 21:31:45 Ad $0.05 tax to the gasoline and oil that we have that would generate millions of dollars every year. That money only goes to security.
1178 2018-02-21 21:31:39 Nothing major in the end thank goodness. A disconnected pipe was allowing fumes into the car and oil around the engine casing was burning off. Had a clean up and a few minor repairs needed. 
1179 2018-02-21 21:31:33 In case you weren’t in my room today you can still see parts of my naked oil show on SC! And even take screenshots ;) I got soaked and covered in oil

1181 2018-02-21 21:31:20 I challenge @Tim_Cost to present evidence of anything they have discovered. Especially how they always claim "groundbreaking research" I'm sure he'll have plenty of papers to show unless he bought the snake oil sales pitch.
1182 2018-02-21 21:31:16 USA pumps oil and makes exploits human capital. It’s not mutually exclusive. It takes human capital to exploit what’s in the ground. They weren’t exporting it

What really makes me laugh is that India is interested in our oil which we can't seem to move. They'd do better to buy it from the US
1200 2018-02-21 21:29:49 good it will be nice to see the Us pay  a lot more for Oil and electric power oh and water
1201 2018-02-21 21:29:47 You mentioned today it was Bruce Levine's birthday. You guys should have chipped in and bought him a new phone. His reports are one of my favorite parts of your show, but he sounds like he's being held captive in an oil drum.

1203 2018-02-21 21:29:45 Russiagate is a fart in the wind. Election results are incosequential.  Real issues are about control of energy recourses, service contracts and maintaining security over gas and oil pipelines.

1205 2018-02-21 21:29:30 The causes? Happy to focus on US imperialism and oil wars if you want.
1206 2018-02-21 21:29:21 Have you read the white paper?  All Petros are issued by the Venezuelan mafia, and they have a formula by which they will set redemption value - and surprise, surprise; redemption is in Bolívares rather than oil or other commodities.
1207 2018-02-21 21:29:21 My body is sore as fuckkk. I seriously  need a full body massage, hot bath and a run down with some oil.

1209 2018-02-21 21:29:03 @cowshedonline hi. Please can you advise where I can get a full ingredient list for the Udderly gorgeous stretch mark oil? I have a nut allergy so can’t purchase until I have checked the ingredient. I’ve emailed but no reply yet. Many thanks.
1210 2018-02-21 21:29:02 Not just grain but for other products as well - potash, canola oil, etc.
1211 2018-02-21 21:29:00 [ I was making brownies, and this loser almost put 2 1/2 cups of oil in instead of 1/2 cup. Could you imagine? ]
1212 2018-02-21 21:28:43 You know, until recently I never connected the fact that the conservative pundits who are so anti-science are the same ones pushing snake oil supplements.
1213 2018-02-21 21:28:35 I knew my break line needed fixing and my oil needed to be changed which is why I brought it in. I also needed 2 new front tie rods, 2 new front tires, and a tire rotation.
1214 2018-02-21 21:28:33 No study, article or investigation is going to convince me (or anyone outside the US) that stricter gun laws wouldn't drastically reduce gun deaths, specifically mass shootings and school shootings.

1291 2018-02-21 21:18:55 @strofoss I would cube some sweet potatoes, roast them with oil, cumin, cinnamon, chili powder, garlic powder salt and pepper. YUMMY!
1292 2018-02-21 21:18:54 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1293 2018-02-21 21:18:54 i’ve thought the same thing about baby oil before.
1294 2018-02-21 21:18:42 Credible. He’s running  he club into the ground. Like when you’re about to trade a car in and you can’t be arsed to replace the leaky oil filter or fill up the wiper juice or replace the tyres. #itfc
1295 2018-02-21 21:18:42 About as sincere as a Snake Oil salesman. 
1296 2018-02-21 21:18:34 i buy the schmaltz.  healther than coconut oil.
1297 2018-02-21 21:18:28 Basis of EU subsidy flawed as is based on land size irrespective of production and/or value to economy.  Oil sheikh gets EU money for having racing stables !!!  At least half of EU subsidy is wasted.  UK money wasted by EU.  End CAP by March 2019 !!!
1298 2018-02-21 21:18:21 @KiehlsUK any tips on how to open the cleansing oil?! I’ve been trying to get my new bottle pump to work for 10 minutes and no joy. Have had to give up and unscrew the pump. 
1299 2018-02-21 21:18:13 To our nation. Just say it.  And POTUS has done nothing.  He still hasn't said one bad word about Russia or Putin.  
Refuses to implement sanctions 
Refuses to cut the cost of oil and harm Russia monetarily 
Refuses to take measures to prevent future meddling 
Russian puppet
1300 2018-02-21 21:18:00 Olive oil, tomato, garlic and soy. It's a recipe which doesn't state quantities so I've guessed. Current philosophy is nothing ventured, nothing gained. If it all goes wrong, there's toast. :)
1301 2018-02-21 21:18:00 No way, it seems familiar ( crazy oil)
1302 2018-02-21 21:17:17 So apparently my dad has cannabis oil?
1303 2018-02-21 21:16:50 Gotta be oil. Glistening.
1304 2018-02-21 21:16:48 How was your experience working in oil and gas?
1305 2018-02-21 21:16:41 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.67% #NASDAQ -0.30% #Ftse100 0.48% #GBPUSD 1.3927 #EURGBP 0.8828 #EURUSD 1.2297 #Gold -0.42% #Oil -0.90%

1307 2018-02-21 21:16:00 Or go fight for oil?
1308 2018-02-21 21:15:58 I just shaved and I feel so amazing I just wanna get hot oil rubbed all over me 
1309 2018-02-21 21:15:57 very good point but like we saw in oil collapse, even bankruptcy-driven discipline is an ephemeral mirage.  reality is 10s of billions of capital waiting on sidelines to come into cap structures in front of equity, which may be where we head, so these stocks may have lost decade
1310 2018-02-21 21:15:40 Sure, BUT HOW WOULD ANYONE IN THOSE SHELTERS TELL TIME?
1311 2018-02-21 21:15:39 1 drop of Peppermint essential oil in ice cold water
1312 2018-02-21 21:15:21 I agree. If the oil price is significantly higher, the incentives will be there
1313 2018-02-21 21:15:16 but you do know why America is in the middle east stealing oil ... which is my only point
1314 2018-02-21 21:14:58 Burning the midnight oil...
1315 2018-02-21 21:14:58 You should make a tread of products you rec one day cause I saw you tweet abt coconut oil and i used this shit 
1316 2018-02-21 21:14:49 Roll up to car dealership to get an oil change & they let me know "oh by the way your car has another recall." I'm like uhh okay was anyone going to inform me. Wtf. Btw this is at least the third recall y'all!
1317 2018-02-21 21:14:41 sitting on my balcony , made me a smoothie , im lathered in coconut oil , letting my hair breathe .. got my book with me .. about to write

1319 2018-02-21 21:14:22 “From one snake oil salesman to another...rest in peace”
1320 2018-02-21 21:14:06 Nordic model is good but heavily subsidised by oil, plus much lower unemployment and higher wages. Not workable in UK.
1321 2018-02-21 21:14:05 i feel like they added a layer of oil for that outfit especially
1322 2018-02-21 21:14:04 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
1323 2018-02-21 21:14:00 To be fair we have to walk in the road most of the time as the pavements are made of ice/olive oil/roller skates and marbles.
1324 2018-02-21 21:13:24 if data is the new oil, Capita has a monopoly on deep extraction from schools
1325 2018-02-21 21:12:56 Is there a list for senators and congresspeople taking money from  Big Oil, Big Pharma, Health Industry Lobby, defense contractors?
1326 2018-02-21 21:12:50 Have you tried Coconut Oil? It works well for me.
1327 2018-02-21 21:12:41 Jerry, U could have left the water restrictions in place.  LA Aholes don't need green lawns.  You might also ban the palm trees that carry burning palm oil for miles.
1328 2018-02-21 21:12:41 You're clearly a kool-aid drinker. Alex Jones watcher perhaps? Just a guess. Climate change is happening, end of discussion. 99 percent of scientists agree at this point. The one percent? Bought by big oil. But I'm sure all govts besides the US are conspiring right? My goodness.
1329 2018-02-21 21:12:37 He owes me money for pretending to be Rock n Roll! He's a fraud a snake oil salesman. I want a refund from the 70s-80s , nuggie!
1330 2018-02-21 21:12:32 U forgot oil lol
1331 2018-02-21 21:12:23 23:6 And I will establish that day shall his children lift up a lamentable which thou hast opened you in a rock, and scatter the house of our God: so will ye see the LORD, when I shall choose the thing before the oil according to the work which is in heaven.
1332 2018-02-21 21:12:20 @VinnieTortorich Been trying NSNG for a few weeks. I love olive oil, so I use it at pretty much every lunch and dinner on turkey, veggies, cheese, etc. Any worries about getting too much olive oil?
1333 2018-02-21 21:12:19 I have very dry skin as well and when my regular routine isn't enough I use Aquaphor or solid coconut oil, which smells fabulous. I'm anxious to see what others do. :)
1334 2018-02-21 21:12:19 EZ shares -0.1%, US shares -0.6%..fell from +1.1% on the back of more confident/hawkish Fed minutes. US 10 yr bond yld +5bp to 2.94%. Oil -1.1%. Iron ore +0.2% to $76.9. ASX futures +0.1%. $A 0.7811 as $US up +0.4% on more hawkish Fed and rise in US PMIs v Europe and Japan PMIs
1335 2018-02-21 21:12:10 Venezuela creating its own cryptocurrency backed by oil... Kinda defeats the purpose of the original intent of cryptocurrencies...
1336 2018-02-21 21:11:58 Thanks I just got some tea tree oil I can add to anything
1337 2018-02-21 21:11:56 @paulpogba you're a mess,shit and utmost disappointment
1338 2018-02-21 21:11:32 Its probably discounted Canadian oil Yanks are selling to India at world price cause our Mr Dress Up wouldn't approve pipelines to eastern Canada
1339 2018-02-21 21:11:18 Oil - heads up for the inventory data due around the bottom of the hour Private data, released to subscribers to their service at 4.30pm NY time and hits media in the minutes following

1340 2018-02-21 21:10:34 Curry sauce is curry powder mixed with water and oil...so the lumps are where it hasn't been stirred......or a poo perhaps?
1341 2018-02-21 21:10:29 Nope. Won't do it. Can't do it. Not gonna happen. We get what we tolerate, and we've tolerated it way too long.
1342 2018-02-21 21:10:22 Saudi oil interests!!!!!
1343 2018-02-21 21:10:22 I been taking care of my hair deep conditioning, oil treatments, cowashing and my hair has gotten so much better i’m so happy

1346 2018-02-21 21:10:11 It means those provinces emit more on a per person basis from the Ag sector than other provinces. Just like AB and SK emit more from oil and gas. Nothing sinister in the stat. It's a perfectly  acceptable comparison industries and govts have done for decades and decades.
1347 2018-02-21 21:10:08 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
1348 2018-02-21 21:10:01 Oh yes it wouldn't be right without the oil!
1349 2018-02-21 21:09:59 Definitely agree with that. I’m skeptical of a lot of the CBD oil claims, but I also doubt his true objection was science based.
1350 2018-02-21 21:09:58 So on the one hand EU meeting with delegates from countries affected wanting EU to help control deforestation by limiting Palm oil and when EU do,then there is a protest and appeal by another group from such countries who report it to the WTO! The right choice is not always easy
1351 2018-02-21 21:09:55 Peanut oil is a myth. All ingredients are legally required to be listed. Bovine serum is not an adjuvant, it is used as a growth medium and is not left in the end product
1352 2018-02-21 21:09:43 I’m using it in about 2weeks time, same job as the Cole and Son wallpaper. Wallpapering stairway wall, all woodwork @LittleGreene flat oil eggshell, and absolute matt emulsion in places! Really looking forward to it 
1353 2018-02-21 21:09:43 @Walmart clearly needs more auto techs. 4 employees no cars in the bay. And still no oil change a hour later #smokebreak #hangingout
1354 2018-02-21 21:09:43 Wow yes you’re not wrong here but am I wrong on the oil?? It’s worked like that for me in the past when it’s about to bubble over, splash some olive oil in and BAM it’s saved. Am I CRAZY? (Probably)
1355 2018-02-21 21:09:42 When liberal thinking has the momentum, there simply aren't as many opportunities in the world to profit off of the more unsavory industries (be it oil, tobacco, corruption in general etc.) without scrutiny. This is why Russia has found allies like Trump and to a degree the GOP.
1356 2018-02-21 21:08:34 Duncan? This scarecrow here keeps asking for his oil can. That aint right, is it?
1357 2018-02-21 21:08:32 Estimated by mid MARCH 2018 ~ $DAX - 14%

USA $DJI may follow, $DAX will lead, EU

Moves are coming out of ASIA, $BHP lower 5% AM today
Largest exporter of OIL in world, Major exporter of iron ore into China

$DAX is largest CHINA BUS partner.
1358 2018-02-21 21:08:31 It really was, but there was one scary scene that scared me as a kid. That one time Lightning McQueen got crushed and starting “bleeding” oil. ITS STILL STUCK IN MY MEMORY
1359 2018-02-21 21:08:26 The tax scam had nothing to do with it, idiot! Alternative energy sources do. Get out of the dark ages and wake up. Oil and coal are not the answer if we give a damn about the planet!
1360 2018-02-21 21:08:23 "Oil is literally liquid gold."

No. bitch. Liquid gold is literally liquid gold.
1361 2018-02-21 21:08:01 And he obtained them all on his own right?
1362 2018-02-21 21:07:58 That awkward moment when oil isn't made from dead dinos and my class had a melt down. Half basically threw the bible at the professor and the other half were like "but why tho"
1363 2018-02-21 21:07:55 Sell it like they sold our strategic oil reserves - way below market value to pals
1364 2018-02-21 21:07:51 Then at target I just get the shea moisture mask for like $10 or sleep with coconut oil in my hair once a week!
1365 2018-02-21 21:07:42 Omg ive used acrylic since freshman year OIL IS SO DIFFERENT BUT IM LIKING ITS PROPERTIES
1366 2018-02-21 21:07:38 He tried some of the snake oil he's selling?

1370 2018-02-21 21:07:25 I am so glad CBD oil is having a moment, it deserves it way more than kale and coconut oil ever did
1371 2018-02-21 21:07:21 do you think they gave nice oil colours to giles in prison?

1375 2018-02-21 21:06:48 ...and now that he's gone, YOU get to bring in the oil drilling to destroy the fishing and natural habitat.     AND you take NRA money.  Hypocrite>  #VoteThemOut2018 #ENOUGH
1376 2018-02-21 21:06:43 Invariably the oil tends to mess up the everywhere in its vicinity. I doubt that drilling is compatible with resorts
1377 2018-02-21 21:06:43 i'm looking forward to seeing tony hayward in hell.  it's hotter than an ocean full of hot oil down here.
1378 2018-02-21 21:06:43 Messed up how after they make a movie with a robot they lure it to a recycling yard with the promise of fresh oil and nice crunchy gears (which are snacks for robots).
1379 2018-02-21 21:06:43 I think there's lots of oil jobs in North Dakota, and these surveys often weight employment opportunities heavily.
1380 2018-02-21 21:06:41 Yow Rex Tillerson came here so mi convinced seh oil deh yah da man yah nuh guh nuh weh weh oil nuh deh him goodly all buy da whole South Coast or where eva dem seh di oil deh
1381 2018-02-21 21:06:29 I can see it now somebody get black out drunk in Mexico do some dumb shit and wakes up in an oil drum with 17 Mexican yelling at you in a language you don’t understand
1382 2018-02-21 21:06:25 every time I force myself to do something I don’t want to do I tell myself “you’re an adult you have to do it” & that’s how an oil change gets done ladies + gents
1383 2018-02-21 21:06:23 I heard rosemary oil is good for that
1384 2018-02-21 21:06:06 No wonder looking @ the ingredients :) 100% sugar (in the form of fruit juice and purees). I'd love you to try one of our 'smoothies'! (shake base of coconut oil and collagen) + then add just a few berries. Filling, fresh and no BS/insulin spike! :)
1385 2018-02-21 21:06:04 As he hold up ski’s, wearing shades, jacket, gloves all made from oil products, sigh....
1386 2018-02-21 21:05:45 wow! Apparently I’ve got a stake in an oil field in Africa.  You could be an African Princess then!
1387 2018-02-21 21:05:42 It wasn't Bush's administration that bugged delegates at Copenhagen for US corporate interests.

It wasn't Bush that oversaw massive oil production increases, or supported a neoliberal coup in Brazil in 2016 that led to an explosion of new logging.
1388 2018-02-21 21:05:41 Where's my sesame oil with salt&pepper????
1389 2018-02-21 21:05:33 Democrats and their wish to regulate industries harmful to the environment are a real threat to oil profits down the line, their focus on human rights abuses threaten more sanctions against actors like Russia, and the spread of liberal thought is always a threat to authoritarians

1391 2018-02-21 21:05:21 Tea tree oil. Use it for pimples, damaged skin, cuts...

1393 2018-02-21 21:05:14 can you vape capsicum oil
1394 2018-02-21 21:04:59 Yep. An oil I will never use!!
1395 2018-02-21 21:04:57 This is why we Average Americans have no confidence in anything that CNN says or reports. #CNNFakeNews.  #BoycottCNN. Their journalist, and I use that description loosely, are nothing but Dem Operatives selling snake oil news!

1406 2018-02-21 21:03:39 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1407 2018-02-21 21:03:37 Ya, like the world just got a little darker...And I remember hearing something somewhere too about that...but even so come Lord Jesus..we need to have our lamps trimmed and extra oil...
1408 2018-02-21 21:03:32 He put it in the oven after it had marinated.  It’s so much easier to bake it, and less oil is always best!

1413 2018-02-21 21:03:03 You can't use ignorance as an excuse (though many people do) but it can absolutely be the cause of your behaviour - especially when combined with a sufficiently large marketing budget donated by gun lobbys and oil companies.

1417 2018-02-21 21:02:42 We’ve made over half our #smallschool staff redundant in that time. We have less support from our local authority and are regularly making spending decisions that should never need to be made - CPD or oil for the boiler? That’s hardly something to be proud of. #fundingcuts

1422 2018-02-21 21:01:41 The whole world is blind can’t see can’t save these innocent . No one cares them because they have no oil  . UN is freaking blind . Shame on all of US
1423 2018-02-21 21:01:39 Thinking about the time I ate cool ranch Doritos and burned pine needle oil in my room and the smells combined perfectly to produce the exact aroma of weed
1424 2018-02-21 21:01:37 We did a bunch of low oil price runs, with low NEB as our reference. Renewables cost sensitivity did not change electrification level much but drove changes in renewable tech shares. So we thought of it as a resilient policy pathway.
1425 2018-02-21 21:01:29 I bet he smells like an oil slick and if you flick your bic too close to him, you're likely to start an ecological disaster. You can slip-n-slide on that hair, hey @DonaldJTrumpJr ?

1431 2018-02-21 21:00:46 Friendship and money, oil and water.
1432 2018-02-21 21:00:45 Excellent. Keep it up, the amount of disinformation out there is astounding. The Tories put all our economic eggs in the oil basket and it's going to take time and MONEY to diversify. Let's use the past to fund the future for all Canadians.
1433 2018-02-21 21:00:38 The players are simply commodities/components of commodities with quantitative markets made on them for price, probability and volatility. No different from a bushel of wheat, a barrel of oil or a share of common stock. Absolutely fungible
1434 2018-02-21 21:00:37 My weirdo neighbor wanted to share some hash oil with me. Instead of putting it on some wax paper or a joint like a normal person he put a huge glob of it ON MY DOOR HANDLE and I didn't realize until I put my hand in it and screamed.
1435 2018-02-21 21:00:30 Very sad time every time I take my car for an oil change, because I get to find out other things on my car I need to repair
1436 2018-02-21 21:00:29 Not unfounded, peanut oil is used in vaccine adjuvants, so it is more than possible that this particular allergy is derived from vaccines, ditto bovine serum is also used in adjuvants, hence lactose allergies.
1437 2018-02-21 21:00:25 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1438 2018-02-21 21:00:18 As a Calgarian I am embarrassed that our school teachers just paid the hypocrite Suzuki $50K for a speaking engagement to hear him discuss destroying our Oil industry. The very industry that parents of school children work in to make a living!
1439 2018-02-21 21:00:13 OIL DIFF: 3.78 -> 3.82
1440 2018-02-21 21:00:13 Bigger bugger for the shop. they may have to buy another clutch and seal depending on what's gone wrong. From feel of it I suspect new seal has failed or not been bedded right. Slip feels like oil on clutch plate.
1441 2018-02-21 21:00:12 Bro they made me wait an hour and thirty minutes and didn’t even change my oil because they couldn’t open the hood lmao smh
1442 2018-02-21 20:59:52 Yup!! I got one in Peach oil (haven’t tried it yet) but my usual is Toffee Dip and that BANGS with just any dark brown lip liner
1443 2018-02-21 20:59:45 Did you know that fat soluble vitamins are better absorbed when consumed with fats, oils. My favorite salad combination: kale+cucumber+carrots+tahini sauce +lemon squeezed+ olive oil. #whatdidyoulearn
1444 2018-02-21 20:59:25 Eeehhh voy sin oil
1445 2018-02-21 20:59:20 shit i need to go to the dentist and get my car's oil changed
1446 2018-02-21 20:59:16 it won't stop for a long time because there are too many economic and strategic interests at stake. Syria is an oil rich country and geographically well located. besides the muslims religious conflicts tha are even worse.  Pity for the innocent people who have to suffer.
1447 2018-02-21 20:59:09 @Chocolatier_REL I used a Cacao powder, sweetened it a tad with maple syrup and used coconut oil to bind it.
1448 2018-02-21 20:59:05 Smaddi can update me bout di oil? Cos me need fi know if is real prosperity time.
1449 2018-02-21 20:58:53 My eczema has been spreading and no lotion or oil in the world can quench my skins thirst 
1450 2018-02-21 20:58:43 Nah, None of us mind.
1451 2018-02-21 20:58:33 I'm getting my oil changed and I'm a bit delirious because I haven't eaten in 9 hours and this old lady just walked in and I thought I was hallucinating but she told me her whole life story and Judy from Virginia, if you're reading this, call your grandma she misses you.
1452 2018-02-21 20:58:30 quick, pass laws to protect big oil before we can study why that refinery went broke
1453 2018-02-21 20:58:28 Osmo oil will seal it and bring the colour of the wood/grain out
1454 2018-02-21 20:58:24 $TRCH finally making a move. Looking for $???? Where can it go??? Anyone? Oil yet?? Holding small amount. #pennystocks #oil #oilwell
1455 2018-02-21 20:58:24 You think I care that it’s ghetto to take my braids out while waiting for an oil change? Well you better think again and the mechanic better work FAST.
1456 2018-02-21 20:58:09 Just picked up my Q7 from Audi after repairing an oil leak and doing a major service. The heating now doesn't work and I have a severe knocking sound coming from the front.Not bad for a car I've only had 7 mths. 2 breakdowns and now a 3rd visit booked. Diabolical
@AudiUKCare
1457 2018-02-21 20:58:00 Educate myself by burying my head in the sand? Listening to cons say how the will reduce the debt, but only increase it? Listen to oil and gas apologist whine about “socialism” when oil and gas world wide is subsidized at 10 million/min? Educate yourself. You’ve been conned.
1458 2018-02-21 20:57:56 Several things possibly: a shift in focus from production to shareholder returns (which they can't afford), dollar hitting bottom and interest rates moving up causing oil to be capped, outspending FCF, mega debt with rising rates coming on the debt, exceeding 10mm/day prod

1468 2018-02-21 20:56:01 Look how much oil based products are used to grow, ship and refine these products that 'replace' oil products.  Sounds rather silly...at best.

1472 2018-02-21 20:55:11 I’ve been several times alone for business when I worked in the oil and gas industry. It’s actually quite nice and westernized.
1473 2018-02-21 20:55:06 Try a conditioner! And an oil, Argan or coconut oil (if works for your hair)
1474 2018-02-21 20:55:00 "No correlation with gun laws and murder rates" You cannot be serious. I mean, just come out and say "WE LOVE GUNS" but don't come out with indefensible bullshit

1483 2018-02-21 20:54:15 No need its definitely the clutch slipping. It's the same as when it went in which was oil seal leaking onto dry clutch.
1484 2018-02-21 20:54:13 It's not great, but there is a solution for both & I've beaten depression before, so I will do again. Really hope the cbd oil brings you some relief, it really must be agony :/

1487 2018-02-21 20:53:38 As a born/raised Texan, I say how about leading the way on Single Payer, Living Wage, Net Neutrality, Stopping Big Oil, Strengthening #unions, #privacy, police murders & ALL those things we’ve ALREADY been in the streets about for YEARS?? THAT is the winning campaign message.
1488 2018-02-21 20:53:24 Water and oil don't mix, maybe they never will, and I dont mind it

1491 2018-02-21 20:53:10 1/ We still pay less tax in AB than any other province, even with the C-tax. The Alberta Advantage only applies when oil prices are high. And probably the biggest advantage is no PST -- I sure wouldn't rather be paying a sales tax than C-tax
1492 2018-02-21 20:52:51 When I have no makeup on I’ll get a little oil here and there around my nose but that’s about it

Arming ppl Killmonger sees as kin is NOT a megapower fueling uprisings to steal oil and maintain US empire
1498 2018-02-21 20:52:13 That sounds horrid though! Depression is no good. Hope you're managing ok.

And thanks, unfortunately there is no cure. I'm going to try cbd oil. It's my only real hope. :/
1499 2018-02-21 20:52:01 Harming your children by working in the oil sands? Hyperbole much Mark? The coal industry your province supports as well as China and the U.S does far more to harm your child then whatever AB could do.

1501 2018-02-21 20:51:39 Before renewal energy will overtake oil, I foresee gas getting there first. Ghana has the potential to tap into this if the powers that be take the right decisions today.

1509 2018-02-21 20:51:14 Unlikely the govt can find work for everyone. Just hoping for a time when we won't have to argue about oil spills anymore and farmers can still get their wheat to market. Cheers.
1510 2018-02-21 20:51:14 Have been just as much of war hawks as republicans, dropping just as many bombs, serving the needs of corporations over people, such as oil companies and healthcare companies
1511 2018-02-21 20:51:06 Or baked with olive oil across the top, now that’s the business!!!!
1512 2018-02-21 20:50:57 They couldn't because US corporations had already claimed land rights to the oil fields. That's neocolonialism. One only needs to conquer the land where there's resources, not the people. 
1. Kill resisting leaders 
2. Install corrupt leaders. 
3. Have them sign away the land.

1514 2018-02-21 20:50:40 I prefer cutting potatoes & making homemade fries all the time they’re so much better especially fried in some olive oil 
1515 2018-02-21 20:50:28 LRT very interesting read on the outlook of the worlds energy demand, supply and shift in sources of energy. Renewable energy is coming for oil, but not just yet.
1516 2018-02-21 20:50:27 Constitution and flag seemed to have been lost abroad also. All they keep finding is this useless oil.
1517 2018-02-21 20:50:25 Jiffy Lube did my oil change before my coffee could even cool down and that was the highlight of my day.
1518 2018-02-21 20:50:24 Honestly fry fish filet with oil on a pan, season with salt. Make a side of pico de Gallo. Heat corn tortillas on a skillet & bam so good 
1519 2018-02-21 20:50:22 Sincerely. I share the same thought with you. But can we blame them, it's their major oil well. 
1520 2018-02-21 20:50:20 Delicious? Doesn't sound like it... nor look like it

1530 2018-02-21 20:49:03 Cream cheese seems to be the solution rather than coconut oil. Making mac & cheese? Add cream cheese. Making cookies? Add cream cheese. Making a cake? Fill that shit with cream cheese frosting

1540 2018-02-21 20:48:11 Ma, not now huge amount of Nigerian money, were spending on importation of refined oil to this country. What is opinion towards the modular refineries just licensed to the private companies. And the future effect on our economy.
1541 2018-02-21 20:48:11 The shoe horn tho. My best friends dads a cobbler and when you’re in the shop and you use one I feel like a gilded age oil Barron.

1545 2018-02-21 20:47:32 I’ve only cohabitated with one man. He moved into my house & kept his own crib for the first year ... he picked up the bills. I bought the groceries. He kept my oil changed & all my other needs met. I don’t believe he wanted for anything either. Very good times.
1546 2018-02-21 20:47:24 How about showing them the map that shows the billions of dollars that they benefit when they do oil sands related business in other provinces? CEPA may have one.
1547 2018-02-21 20:47:19 Thank you! I've been using this overly priced oil but jeez I can't seem to escape them! I just feel fat bc I'm at the stage where I'm rounding quick  lmao! But noted!!!

1560 2018-02-21 20:45:39 Anti-globalist? How ignorant, he is an oil man! Why do you think he is friends with tillerson? Do you think they sell only to Russians....did he not use German banks to launder money? Get over yourself and try learning what you speak of....
1561 2018-02-21 20:45:36 I’ll bid you goodnight as I’m off to bed. Stuck on an oil rig West of Shetland and up at 5 in the morning. I enjoyed conversing with you even although we have different views. Have a good night
1562 2018-02-21 20:45:25 Still selling snake oil!
1563 2018-02-21 20:45:18 The 10 minute oil change has morphed into the 10 minute parts and services sales pitch. And costs a small fortune as well.

1565 2018-02-21 20:45:14 10$ is chump change for contractors those guys make 100k a year plus doing security over seas guarding oil rigs or high profile businessmen. They would need a worthy wage to give them motive. I’m sorry but 10$ an hour is a laughable wage. I haven’t made that since high school
1566 2018-02-21 20:45:09 Root to Stem Tip of the Day!  Dont toss those broccoli stems -- throw them into a salad or saute with some olive oil, salt and pepper. Substitute broccoli stalks in recipes that call for Brussels sprouts.

1579 2018-02-21 20:43:51 Fyi my wife is a senior volunteer manager and apparently word is spreading like wildfire among her lovely old volunteers about it, which is what prompted her to try it.
Many, many anecdotal reports of great easing of inflammation and pain, just from the seed oil.

1596 2018-02-21 20:41:47 I spilled an entire Morrison’s salad worth of olive oil into mine once & the guys at apple told me tough shit & made me sit at what was basically the ‘naughty table’ for a replacement that I had to pay for 
1597 2018-02-21 20:41:43 And the reason eastern refineries are so supplied is because the eastern tree huggers are willing to pay more for import oil than that piped from western Canada... Go figure.
1598 2018-02-21 20:41:30 Finding oil is one but finding commercial oil is another
1599 2018-02-21 20:41:30 I will never understand why people put oil on their face
1600 2018-02-21 20:41:28 Explain to me how building 7 came down. Did u even know that a third building came down? They barely even went to Afghanistan, the real target was iraq and control of the oil. Saudi Arabia and us set up the terrorists in 1979. Operation cyclone to drive the soviets out of..

1610 2018-02-21 20:40:12 The outlook shows China’s carbon emissions from energy use peaking in  the mid-2020s. Renewables, nuclear and hydro account for more than 80%  of the increase in China’s energy demand by 2040, with renewables  overtaking oil to become the country’s second largest energy source.

1614 2018-02-21 20:39:48 75 total of mustard/cumin oil which is the oil we fried cumin and mustard seeds in. At home I’d use regular veg oil and just add maybe 5g each of ground cumin and ground mustard to the marinade.

1618 2018-02-21 20:39:20 The lines at the Costco gas pumps are a half dozen cars deep. Is there something that I don’t know? Did we declare war on an oil rich nation? Does Costco have magic gas? Seriously, what’s up?
1619 2018-02-21 20:39:15 Kace ta cire
1620 2018-02-21 20:38:28 well that's just a risk that you're going to have to accept, and don't get me wrong that you are being fully compensated for taking on that risk, even if you yourself aren't getting a personal cheque. Is that what you want? Oil money? move to AB and get a job here then
1621 2018-02-21 20:38:08 The big word there is "instantaneous" it's not stabilised so final figure if it does stabalise and flow oil doesn't look promising sadly. Back to slb drawing board for next attempt on sidetrack
1622 2018-02-21 20:38:06 Sure we also import most of our gasoline from over around Iraq. Meanwhile we have Tankers shipping away millions of barrels of oil from the Grand Banks just off our shores. That's how we do things here.
1623 2018-02-21 20:38:05 i’m prob deficient in a bunch of vitamins bc i just dumped some canned black beans, chick peas, and corn into a bowl with lime juice and oil and thought it was good as fuck. no one else in their right mind would’ve enjoyed that

1628 2018-02-21 20:37:47 The projections also show, for the first time, global oil demand  peaking by 2040. Oil remains the world’s largest fuel source, however.
 This 2018 edition of BP’s outlook also projects coal will peak before 2030, an even earlier projection than it gave last year.
1629 2018-02-21 20:37:38 Oil? In Jamaica?

How close were they to Petrojam??
1630 2018-02-21 20:37:18 As far as I can read, the stance in BC is that they are concerned about oil spills, which seems quite fair. Bizarrely I haven't seen any efforts to address these concerns. Instead the economic argument gets repeated over and over and other provinces make threats and criticisms.
1631 2018-02-21 20:37:11 Theory: the oil will run out before climate change gets really serious
1632 2018-02-21 20:37:10 Only reason I'm going to see black panther is for that 16.99+tax bag of popcorn.. Soo I can drench that bitch in oil
1633 2018-02-21 20:37:09 The main scenario in the company’s latest annual “Energy Outlook”,  released yesterday, shows renewables rising four-fold to 2,000 million  tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2035. This is an upwards revision of  around 400Mtoe compared to last year’s main forecast. BP report

1641 2018-02-21 20:35:59 I actually love reasoning (or lack thereof) like this. Sometimes, you allow the oil spill go unnattended because when we need to do the purge, no time for accelerant. Calm down. Boys will roll on you soon. Revolution, Shanawole. Heads will roll oo. You. Were. Warned.

1644 2018-02-21 20:35:32 I feel attacked when I go to get my oil changed. They always ask, "ma'am did you know you had absolutely no oil left?" 
Like of course I did. The light has been beeping at me for a week now. My response though? 
"Well. It's a surprise to me."
1645 2018-02-21 20:35:32 Boiiii let me tell you times are hard, I’m getting an oil change right now and someone ran out without paying LMFAO what in the fuck. Never seen anything like that
1646 2018-02-21 20:35:18 Expanding US energy production hurts RUS right in the pocketbook with lower oil prices. It’s why RUS wanted a weak HC to win as her policies would have driven oil prices higher bringing hard currency to RUS.
1647 2018-02-21 20:35:13 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?

1649 2018-02-21 20:35:04 If you assert anti-facts we won't debate. The EU has on no measure been successful since 1974 when the free money ran out and oil crisis ensued, not compared to the rest of the world. The UK has outgrown the EU for almost all the period simce 1984.
1650 2018-02-21 20:34:54 You are burying yourselves in the past. Oil and gas will be depleted and the industries will die right after the planet. The future is solar the future is wind the future is anything that doesn’t burn and pollute. Adapt.
1651 2018-02-21 20:34:42 You can only sell oil at the market rate, that's why it sold in dollars right now its costing more to extract from UK waters, on average, than it is to sell what don't you understand about that?
1652 2018-02-21 20:34:37 Where would Man city be without the oil money?
1653 2018-02-21 20:34:27 That's the problem we have had signs of oil but not of great flow and HH wasn't flowed long enough however time will tell

1671 2018-02-21 20:32:07 Would you ask a stranger to help then pour olive oil all over their hand if they say yes? Would you ask a male or female for help? Would you lie and say its inside when its actually at home? Would you bend over a chair or the table or just stand with legs open?
1672 2018-02-21 20:31:58 Were you aware that a CIA operation overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran in 1953 because they were about to nationalize British oil interests, installing a brutal pro-American dictator? Which makes us as responsible for Iran's current theocracy as anyone else?

1693 2018-02-21 20:30:11 Equally bad wherever they occur. Looking forward to when we can less dependent on oil.
1694 2018-02-21 20:30:01 One time when I was 16 I was wearing hazel contacts and I went to greet my Mum before I left the house, she looked right through me and ignored me, as soon as I turned around I felt anointing oil splash my neck followed by a chorus of “Devil, Leave! Devil, Leave! Devil Leave!”
1695 2018-02-21 20:29:44 “Thank you Mumen, these people wanna keep their industries alive and I can understand why they hate me. But Dragonhaven will not be trading in Oil”
1696 2018-02-21 20:29:35 I am glad you identified them as "self proclaimed disciples", majority of them are snake oil salesmen, no substance!
1697 2018-02-21 20:29:27 That's how marijuana gets a bad name.   Uneducated brainwashed old senile people like this spreading false info. CBD oil is a natural cure.
1698 2018-02-21 20:29:21 This is Nigeria.
An oil producing country that regularly imports oil to qwell fuel queues. 
This makes zero sense
1699 2018-02-21 20:29:20 @JustinTrudeau actually sees a future for his children and not $$like CONS  Trudeau listen to the Environmental Impact of such a Destructive Project! Build refineries, w/ workers, oil 4

 Almond 
Honey
Coconut oil 
Egg 
Bit of jam

1702 2018-02-21 20:28:57 Pastor testifies he is against CBD oil, calling it “snake oil,” and “a placebo” @WISH_TV
1703 2018-02-21 20:28:53 Especially DELO 400 MGX, It runs 15000km on diesel engine, have never seen seen such an amazing engine oil! #Caltexbebabeba
1704 2018-02-21 20:28:46 Grapeseed oil, Sweet almond oil, or Jojoba oil?  Decisions decisions
1705 2018-02-21 20:28:43 rub peppermint oil on your temples and drink lemon water with mint leaves 
1706 2018-02-21 20:28:43 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
1707 2018-02-21 20:28:42 Bali body oil commandée, si je reviens pas black je paye mon restau
1708 2018-02-21 20:28:38 @JustinTrudeau no he actually sees a future for his children and not $$like you. Trudeau listen to the Environmental Impact of such a Destructive Project! Build refineries, w/ workers, oil 4 
1709 2018-02-21 20:28:37 Guns reduces population, while sex increases!!?  The elites (those who  control the world through weapons and oil) are seeing high population as a  big problem.
1710 2018-02-21 20:28:31 #chhsphysics Biodiesel was first used with peanut oil to power engines in early 1900s.
1711 2018-02-21 20:28:26 Big news from Denmark. The government has just decided to ban all #oil and #gas drillings on land and close to shore! A big win for both the enviro movement and local resistance groups - and not least the #climate
1712 2018-02-21 20:28:22 because maldives doesn't have oil
1713 2018-02-21 20:28:21 Thanks! And no worries. Btw, they say permits in the North Sea (where Maersk Oil are operating with Chevron and Shell already) are still up for grabs...
1714 2018-02-21 20:28:16 Had to buy my own oil filter today at the service shop... oil change was free 
1715 2018-02-21 20:28:15 Tried to call the car dealership to bring my car in for an oil change and ended up calling the wrong one #KindaSortaWannaKillMyself
1716 2018-02-21 20:28:13 So your perceived rights are more important than stopping hundreds of children being maimed and murdered every year? Cool good to know. I'm glad one of you ridiculous yanks finally had the balls to come out and say it
1717 2018-02-21 20:28:04 Gold. oil, and the dollar are all down.  Silver and interest rates are up. The Dow is a yoyo, up 250, down 300 and up, all in the same hour. What is going on? Algos-- program trading. The investor should sit tight as the profit takers move.
1718 2018-02-21 20:28:00 Venezuela is the first country to have its own crypto currency & it’s backed by oil.  That’s crazy bruh
1719 2018-02-21 20:27:54 ما تموتين تنزلين الكيلوين ماغيرهم وتردين 
1720 2018-02-21 20:27:45 Grossly unethical of Trump & Zinke.Getting oil location info ahead of others. Advance knowledge worth billions
1721 2018-02-21 20:27:43 my Later Donuts have created such lovely oil spots on the bag they're in
1722 2018-02-21 20:27:38 Subhanallah
1723 2018-02-21 20:27:32 Buy some Lavender essential oil and rub it around your temples and on the nape of your neck. Trust me.
1724 2018-02-21 20:27:27 Pipelines are ‘greenest’ way to worsen climate change and increase the risk of oil spills?
1725 2018-02-21 20:27:26 Sure are.
1726 2018-02-21 20:27:19 If you apply a little olive oil and salt they will get crispy. I made taters tots and fish sticks last night and it was very good. But it's uses go beyond just what I mentioned. It come with a cookbook.
1727 2018-02-21 20:27:17 Desde el momento que hablas de TN te sale el kukatrismo de adentro, además nininsulte mi intelecto, no me van a convencer como a Uds ni TN ,ni K5N y si hablamos de corrupto decile a Cristóbal Rojas que devuelva la tarasca que están por dejar sin laburo a 900 personas en oil
1728 2018-02-21 20:27:11 Took Optimus's motor oil and replaced it with molasses, rot in hell Autobot
1729 2018-02-21 20:27:09 So Jamaica finally discover oil ...... yep hhmmm God a come soon fi him world
1730 2018-02-21 20:27:02 Si no fuera por tanto plástico esto parecería la Edad Media.
1731 2018-02-21 20:26:56 Why do we use terms like “new water” when all water is eventually recycled naturally? are we discovering new aquifers like oil companies find new deposits?
1732 2018-02-21 20:26:40 Of course he is the Info Wars BS is owned by a snake oil supplement sales man & nut job.
1733 2018-02-21 20:26:39 Lemme go get this oil for my hair hell ..
1734 2018-02-21 20:26:09 Por esos ojos y en general... Yo iría
1735 2018-02-21 20:26:06 Are your fees for an oil change negotiable? My car is really nice. If you’ll change my oil for half price I will bring it to you for service on a regular basis.
1736 2018-02-21 20:26:05 Now your cooking with peanut oil lol
1737 2018-02-21 20:26:00  لازم ينحرف
1738 2018-02-21 20:25:59 With 30+yr as #Arctic scientist, regulatory specialist, & oil spill responder I KNOW that spills WILL occur & that there is NO EFFECTIVE means to clean up #oilspills in #Actic oceans. I’m “waiting” for #Alternative #energy that will soon put #oilandgas out of business #Alaska
1739 2018-02-21 20:25:58 “Someone help if I have to sit through one more talk about oil trade when I built clean energy and not speak up about it I’m gonna flip”
1740 2018-02-21 20:25:52 we went into Iraq to kill people. That’s what we like to do. Blood give us blood and oil.
1741 2018-02-21 20:25:39 I'm support all day now. You'd be so proud (or at least less cringed) to duo with me. If they call you out for a 2v2, hmu. I'll cc them harder than 7qts of oil could cc you on the side of the road.
1742 2018-02-21 20:25:10 About a week ago on Valentine's Day I was cooking steak. Third steak in, which was mine, was flipping it over with tongs, the damn tongs gave way and the steak flopped and splashed a wave of smoking, bubbling, 1000 degree meat grease and oil right onto my leg.
1743 2018-02-21 20:25:06 Please, stop misusing the word ,"bunkering " when oil theft is the appropriate expression.
1744 2018-02-21 20:25:00 the Venezuelan government is a black box to give information about the sale of oil in #petro #ICO #coins. #blockchain
1745 2018-02-21 20:24:59 Every time I’m about to get my oil changed somewhere else without my dad knowing I feel like I’m stabbing him in the back  cause he used to do it for me 
1746 2018-02-21 20:24:56 I think you’re missing the article. How Regime of Venezuela worked with Syrian regime to sell Assad’s oil
1747 2018-02-21 20:24:54 As much as I'm enjoying the thought of us being rich, we just have signs of some oil (might just be a big gill or two). Don't start looking at Ferrari's yet.
1748 2018-02-21 20:24:49 Yes officer, I am ALL legal today and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
1749 2018-02-21 20:24:47 what a shell of a human that girl is - glad Martin turned her down, he can do better than her.
1750 2018-02-21 20:24:43 Oil PMSL 
1751 2018-02-21 20:24:37 I posted early looking for a walk by the green lady in her 20's or 30's to put hot oil on amd massage her stress away. #win
1752 2018-02-21 20:24:36 Stream will be a little late, everyone. Oil change required. For my car, not me. Will likely start a half hour later than normal.
1753 2018-02-21 20:24:32 Guys, I’m getting an oil change rn lol
1754 2018-02-21 20:24:31 they  found oil but is it a sustainable amount
1755 2018-02-21 20:24:28 Going for a routine oil change, turns into a dented hood and bent locking mechanism thanks to incompetent staff. Only at @MavisTire!
1756 2018-02-21 20:24:17 Normal is overrated.... A "couple orgasms" is overrated. Have a wild night.... Get some olive oil and settle in, get comfy, turn on the really kinky porn and get to anal fisting.... (cough)... I mean that is a non sexual way
1757 2018-02-21 20:24:13 pipelines are the 'greenest' way to get oil to market dontcha know...
1758 2018-02-21 20:24:10 He's shilling snake oil products for InfoWars now. Sad!
1759 2018-02-21 20:24:07 The most offensive part was your alternative energy propaganda...you should have suggested he drink 10 liters of oil.
1760 2018-02-21 20:24:06 Add seven grams of olive oil then stir vigorously.
1761 2018-02-21 20:24:00 similar to how an oil paininting from 1500 vs a 2018 drawing made on paint tool sai are both considered art
1762 2018-02-21 20:23:52 farmer Bertie...you keep ploughing those fields and let Stevey boy deliver the goods
1763 2018-02-21 20:23:48 how good is castor oil really? 
asking for my edges...and my brows
1764 2018-02-21 20:23:39 You forget oil revenue since mid 1970s still the second biggest tax earner for the UK, and what does Scotland get as a sweetener in 1979 the Barnet formula, they have raised 300 billion Scotland never got anything like it back then there are renewables and food export
1765 2018-02-21 20:23:25 Oil has been found in Jamaica wow.. However our government love sweets and US, China or T&T goodly offer them a multi million dollar deal and BOOM oil war start..
1766 2018-02-21 20:23:14 @LidiaBastianich, My last tweet to you reminded me, what type of olive oil should I use on pasta?
1767 2018-02-21 20:23:11 Bones don't turn to oil
1768 2018-02-21 20:23:10 So, used as adjunctive short term measures, these approaches can assist management? When the bicycle wheels go squeaky, we oil them, even though the squeak may eventually return (i.e. despite the treatment having a “poor long term outcome”).
1769 2018-02-21 20:22:57 Sorry sir this is one you have completely wrong. He was a nasty snake oil salesman who preyed on people’s weaknesses and I hope he has gotten the hell he so richly deserves.
1770 2018-02-21 20:22:54 REALITY:
WAEAPON MANUFACTURERS, MEDIC, OIL, ... MONOPOLIES, MERCHANARIED SOLDIER FIRMS, ... SO ON
1771 2018-02-21 20:22:53 おめでとうございます！
1772 2018-02-21 20:22:51 me am waiting for shark to start drinking 500000 thousand barrel of crude oil daily.
1773 2018-02-21 20:22:47 Just shut up. You are irrelevant and just fyi--the pile of your books at Costco is still so high that it's a good place to rest the 8 lb bottle of olive oil I thought was a good idea.
1774 2018-02-21 20:22:33 It’s Trelawny and haven’t really found oil.
1775 2018-02-21 20:22:28 These sevila guys r too rough
1776 2018-02-21 20:22:04 ah crap, oil shortage break already?
1777 2018-02-21 20:22:04 I have a oil fryer too, it's huge and makes great fries but my son is on a health kick so I bought the air fryer with some reservations but give it a shot. I love the thing. With some more tweaking my fries will be just as good as oil fryer.
1778 2018-02-21 20:21:54 Seriously, I would have been excited to hear about this oil discovery for Jamaica.. but check it out. Jamaica isn’t ready.
1779 2018-02-21 20:21:54 LONG $CL_F $OIL spike in option flow, buyers
1780 2018-02-21 20:21:41 So,  they want us to be dependent on foreign oil? Or do they not want us to be able to compete with the world?
1781 2018-02-21 20:21:34 I'd love to cum for an audience with The Queen of Scotland! I'd embrace her Divine Right (and her lovely left), place my orbs and my sceptre in her skilful hands, kneel to kiss her ring, and anoint her with my 'holy oil'. She could reign on me if she likes... 
1782 2018-02-21 20:21:34 it's been warm these past couple of days but it's supposed to get cold again

noooo now I'm in the Summer Mood and also I have to do oil painting homework in the garage without freezing to death
1783 2018-02-21 20:21:30 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
1784 2018-02-21 20:21:09 He’s always been a snake oil salesman but now he’s found the rubiest rubes to dupe. He’s home.
1785 2018-02-21 20:20:19 Kale olive oil and lime juice is pretty good combo

1787 2018-02-21 20:19:51 The thing that really burns me up is how smart these people think they are when they talk about something, in this case the NRA, they have no personal knowledge of. They are just dumb parrots.
1788 2018-02-21 20:19:41 Nzonzi kya olive oil hai bey
1789 2018-02-21 20:19:39 So with all this news of oil... can Jamaica use this to hedge its bets for economic growth and increased investment. Surely it’ll attract heavy industry but will it reduce the horrible cost of energy? Or even catalyse a shift to green energy like Norway?
1790 2018-02-21 20:19:30 Yep, argan oil is better for dry skin! Jojoba oil is great for oily skin because it mimics our skin’s natural sebum. Thanks for reading! 
1791 2018-02-21 20:19:24 Já leu a biografia do Bruce Springsteen ? Topa trocar pela do Neil Young ? Fala comigo aqui...
1792 2018-02-21 20:19:23 He was a very accomplished snake oil salesman.
1793 2018-02-21 20:19:18 Fergie singing the National Anthem sounded like the lady from Bobs Burger singing Oil Spill
1794 2018-02-21 20:19:13 How the "holy" west backed Saudi Arabia, sold weapons and provided military training for the Saudi led strikes in Yemen that killed many innocent women and children.
How Europe and America supported the Military Juntas of Nigeria to gain favor on behalf of their oil corporations.
1795 2018-02-21 20:19:01 About to be burning the midnight oil for the next few days....say a prayer for me
1796 2018-02-21 20:19:00 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
1797 2018-02-21 20:18:59 So dey don't really know what to do with the oil money, now they're doing this mxm
1798 2018-02-21 20:18:56 I DIDN'T tag Jack AND I'm the one who alerted YOU 
to the fact Jack was last one on the list last night.
1799 2018-02-21 20:18:52 @LidiaBastianich just made your bread crumb pasta and added a little extra olive oil as well! Delish! #lidiaskitcchen
1800 2018-02-21 20:18:48 the price of oil isn't that important you say. 
it is to the exchequer who gets tax on every barrel drilled based on the price.
1801 2018-02-21 20:18:32 Also, if we banned the transhipment of oil across national/provincial lines, or if the Harper Government had implemented rules on light Bakken, or if there was a cap on oil transportation.

There were lots of ways to prevent Mégantic, but greed won.
1802 2018-02-21 20:18:22 Q4: I wish all the dermatologists I went to didn't follow the formula of harsh chemicals to fix my acne. It never worked. (I gave up milk and clean my face with oil now. Worked like a charm)
1803 2018-02-21 20:18:21 Obama put sanctions on Russia which which you and you’re a ministration removed as soon as you came into office allowing Putin to have a $300 billion oil deal with Exxon Mobil coincidence I think not!
1804 2018-02-21 20:18:14 you know what? You guys can continue with the blame game. I believe in moving forward. Just so you know, when Nigeria was colonized back then, oil had not been discoverd. It was discovered many years later. If the leaders had truly wanted,...
1805 2018-02-21 20:18:07 Catching up on Master Chef. I've figured out how to be a fine dining chef! Choose 'Vegetable A' (Girolle/Samphire/Celeriac/Beetroot) 'Meat/Fish B' (Razor clam/Three parts of a rabbit/lamb) - ideally Sous Vide, served with an Emulsion/Jus/Smoke/Cocktail/Powdered dust/Oil smear.
1806 2018-02-21 20:17:56 Oil is good .... Olive oil, pure olive oil..... Depends on what your using the oil with though....if its going on a salad then pure olive oil, if its for a "tossed salad" then its still good. If its for.....Oh never mind the details, just have fun
1807 2018-02-21 20:17:50 I didn’t oil my scalp cuz I was rushing to work & I’m payin for it now

Want exclusive rights to the video? Dm me 
1812 2018-02-21 20:17:20 I use peppermint oil, daily. Hand washing constantly.
1813 2018-02-21 20:17:20 The US hit 10.2 million barrels of oil production last week, the highest ever. There is a medium term climate risk associated with all fossil fuels and we need a technological solution, but the short-term geopolitical benefits for the US are undeniable.
1814 2018-02-21 20:17:18 By hand... 500g flour (100g plain flour & 400g of bread flour of your choice), 7g yeast, teaspoon caster sugar, teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoon rapeseed oil, 250ml luke warm water
1815 2018-02-21 20:17:13 Spilled oil all over my pants and fell on my ass so today's been fucking fantastic  atleast it's my Friday
1816 2018-02-21 20:17:07 What would happen if a Lesser Antily found oil, but didn't have the resources to extract it?
1817 2018-02-21 20:16:54 oil painting's goin a lot better but holy shit am I tired now from having to walk out to my car in the rain
1818 2018-02-21 20:16:46 OIL on 2nd 15min candle lower trying to find bottom at 61.20 support. Not confirmed yet. Out DWT 12.65 on trailing stop 1.1% gain.
1819 2018-02-21 20:16:33 So let me get this right... you've raised a ton of money, from corps like the NRA and big oil, and this "winning" is what you're going to brag about. There's blood on your hands and you've essentially smeared it in the face of those who lost loved ones.
1820 2018-02-21 20:16:30 Yeah I use all natural peanut butter, since I've been told that it doesn't have the vegetable oil that adds trans fats to them.
1821 2018-02-21 20:16:23 AZ35: Why is non-Jewish cheese forbidden; Milk from non-Jews; Bread and oil from non-Jewish facilities
1822 2018-02-21 20:16:16 Tillerson wants everyone's oil. He comes in the name of Russia and Exxon. Not the U.S.
1823 2018-02-21 20:16:14 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*

1826 2018-02-21 20:15:40 They also meant less oil for an hour then more oil for the next in a daft mirror image of the moves in stocks
1827 2018-02-21 20:15:35 Cbd +oil adverts on telly ... interesting that they don’t say what’s its for ..  #supershoppers

1833 2018-02-21 20:14:20 Touching the oil in Jamaica will only cause trouble, a country will offer them millions then take the oil and pay them nothing, now Jamaicans have to pay for it, that’s the system for you guys
1834 2018-02-21 20:14:19 Oilers need to keep this guy. He is a good young player who is still developing. Plus he is cheap, the oil will need a few cheap options for next year.

1844 2018-02-21 20:13:29 U.S is doing a great job trying to take oil free from Venezuela. They don't really try to Help people in Venezuela. Why do they pretend not to see Honduran dictadorship as well?

1867 2018-02-21 20:11:15 Oil rigs cost 15-20x land based cost, at about $600m for a rather cramped box that can house 20 people. Today, $600m could launch 70T to Mars, so there's a ways to go.

1871 2018-02-21 20:10:59 John, the economy sucks. Dale Weaver Inc is looking at closing the doors, no work in the oil field.
1872 2018-02-21 20:10:57 They have a little travel size one for like $16 if you wanna just test it out first. It’s amazing! I was breaking out badly from coconut oil and maracuja oil doesn’t make me break out. It smells weird tho lmao

1874 2018-02-21 20:10:47 the guy changing my oil just took down my name and has been calling me “sandy toes” since... i will truly never escape it

1883 2018-02-21 20:10:19 Oh true yeah. Because they have oil.

I was thinking other beans.

1887 2018-02-21 20:09:53 I'm a different kind of girly girl. I can change my tire, i wash my own car, knows how to change my oil, plays madden and rather be outside playing ball with the fellas while still having on a face full of make up and my nails ultra long

1889 2018-02-21 20:09:45 People were happy about the oil for 30 seconds and then we all remember the country we live in and we're all sad again. 

no wonder so many of us are depressed
1890 2018-02-21 20:09:42 $NFX ... even though the oil mix was sti3/3ll better than guidance and volumes were in the upper end of guidance, and not just below the range, as the crowd expected.

1894 2018-02-21 20:09:08 I only go threw phones and become Ispy when YOU start moving different, u can tell when somebody try pull a quick one , but u can’t out slick a can of oil  remember that
1895 2018-02-21 20:08:59 Also when someone you don't talk to much finally pops up going "HEY GIRL, have you tried [insert shitty MLM oil company]??"
1896 2018-02-21 20:08:52 you're right, people faking and guzzling up innocent people's money by pulling on their faith to sell them snake oil is a huge problem. and when that happens the corruption has far reaching effects. Especially when half their fingers are in the political pie.
1897 2018-02-21 20:08:50 WHERE IN THE BIBLE DID JESUS SOLD ANOINTING OIL? YOU DON'T KNOW RIGHT? AND YOU STILL BUY?
1898 2018-02-21 20:08:47 I will NEVER forget going in to that alcohol store and you were tasting straight liquor and I had a spoonful of OLIVE OIL
1899 2018-02-21 20:08:45 I also expect you to go after those Dems who take large amounts of corporate cash from pharmaceuticals, Wall St, insurance, oil companies, etc.

1907 2018-02-21 20:07:56 So by Alberta not allowing BC wines into our Province it is hurting the Winery's and they can't wait for a settlement, but rather seek an injunction. So BC not allowing a pipeline doesn't hurt our industry? No more BC wine for me and no oil/fuel for them
1908 2018-02-21 20:07:51 Worse than this is the companies and lobbyists (mostly Tories) are tied up with. Private healthcare companies, the oil industry, smoking lobby.....this is more worrying.

1913 2018-02-21 20:06:43 i'll try it but i feel like it may make my foundation separate n be patchy even more?? but the moisturizer i've been using is kinda thick so maybe a thinner oil moisturizer would b better
1914 2018-02-21 20:06:41 I was able to start this movement plan ONLY after Sativa oil or Krantom.  So sorry I left that VERY IMPORTANT POINT.  Like I said, a not so good day.  WITHOUT PAIN RELIEF,...there is NO WAY IN HELL I could've sustained the level of consistency.  'suicide disease' is NO joke!  
1915 2018-02-21 20:06:39 I was extremely anti war and was the only one on that side before the Iraq war. I said it was an oil war.

1916 2018-02-21 20:06:32 Who does the cheapest synthetic oil change?
1917 2018-02-21 20:06:31 Wouldn't baby oil wreck it?
 cuz I know you're only supposed to use water-based lubricant.
1918 2018-02-21 20:05:48 Hard to engage if you ignore my words. Stabilizing oil sands output in Alta does not require heavy lifting - it sustains jobs. But doubling down so that even more Albertans in future are dependent on harming their and my children makes climate success less likely.

1923 2018-02-21 20:04:42 They’re replacing the pads and those disk things, and this is on top of changing the oil and replacing all of the fluids for some 50k mile thing. And the dead mouse situation.

1932 2018-02-21 20:04:00 Except the article’s logic and implied conclusion are not solid.  How much money does Cornyn get not only from Exxon, but from the oil and gas sector, together with other PAC’s similarly aligned?  

The NRA is also joined by like-minded PAC’s and other such groups. .....
1933 2018-02-21 20:03:53 Futures positioning is ridiculous! Also if oil keeps trending lower from here - inflation readings will sequentially decelerate (marginally). Not exactly supportive of rate hikes haha!

1968 2018-02-21 20:00:14 Part of the problem is that we know that oil is finite, and the new technologies require more inputs. But we subsidize the inputs, to a point. Recall that cost =/= price and needn't bear any relation to it.
1969 2018-02-21 20:00:03 It is, and taking oil and gold down quickly. Will be interesting to see if the $SPY is strong enough to withstand all this for the last hour. Media will be all over the higher rate expectations overnight, so maybe expect the gap down possibility also.
1970 2018-02-21 20:00:00 Ted Cruz leads the field in being an oil industry slave with $690,000 a year payments to say anything they tell him to.

1972 2018-02-21 19:59:58 Falta mucho, como llevar a la justica a la responsable de la muerte de niños. El Rebsamen es nuestro Sandy Hook y la corrupción nuestra NRA.
1973 2018-02-21 19:59:49 Everyone notice the absence of protesters around the terminal. US oil interests care diddly about coal so don't pay anyone to protest it.
1974 2018-02-21 19:59:36 It's really good. I try to use every product of the hair milk version. They have hair detangler, moisturizer, edge creme hella shit. I love it. That's the only thing I use along with coconut oil and African hair grease
1975 2018-02-21 19:59:22 Oil prices are higher and Venezuela with survive.
1976 2018-02-21 19:59:11 I also recommend tea tree oil. I have regular breakouts on my face and applying it with a cotton swab as a spot treatment works wonders. Make sure to use moisturiser before applying the tea tree as it can be very drying on the skin around the breakouts 
1977 2018-02-21 19:58:56 Does oil paint get out of clothes ever
1978 2018-02-21 19:58:51 You should reach out to the grassroots communities affected as well. Not enough media regarding the victims of this corruption and bribery scheme, thousands of people sick and poisoned as we speak thanks to CPV burning diesel oil. No emergency plan for the public #STOPCPV
1979 2018-02-21 19:58:47 Thought my car was going to need replaced. Turns out the guys at @jiffylube put 7 quarts of oil in a 4 qt engine and almost cost me my car. 
1980 2018-02-21 19:58:44 @POTUS @FLOTUS oil oils what flavor would you like Ma’dam
1981 2018-02-21 19:58:28 I would if I could. @twitter has prevented me from following anyone.

1984 2018-02-21 19:57:45 @MarinerJackUK Cargo Beard Oil is top tidy, heartily recommended!
1985 2018-02-21 19:57:41 They've had to buy a little oil heater, and have paid for boiler cover with you for years, and now there's a problem they just keep CANCELLING. Offering £30 does NOT cut it. I shouldn't have to do this but what choice do I have???

1987 2018-02-21 19:57:37 I'm not and never have been a teacher, I was a technician on oil rigs before I retired. I'm just worried about what the Liberals are doing to our beautiful province. I want it to be here for my kids and grandkids to be able to enjoy.

Take into consideration RU ops take 3-10 to fruition.

1989 2018-02-21 19:57:17 As foul as I found Billy Graham (and all tv evangelists) to be, I never felt he was actually evil. Misguided, closed minded and a snake oil salesman sure,but not evil. Franklin Graham on the other hand is next level batshit crazy and straight up evil.
1990 2018-02-21 19:57:16 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
1991 2018-02-21 19:57:08 Yes it is inspiring/it’s time to vote our way out of the oppression forced upon us by oilers and gun addicts/this new generation is going to help us transition from corruption, oil and guns to morality, prosperity, and peace/good bye to gun addicts ruling our country
1992 2018-02-21 19:57:06 The regime released hundreds of jihadis who joined daish and AQ. Many headed east and some headed to other areas. The regime also made many arrangements with daish such as oil deals and cooperation to attack rebel groups in hama and idlib.
1993 2018-02-21 19:57:04 Well they would say that when really their frightened by the take up and interest in pure EV cars. Cheers oil we will still need you but in only a limited amount. Thanks of the pollution.
1994 2018-02-21 19:57:02 i think gaelic is right tho, that delay is expensiv 4 canada since we'll lose human capital and also long timeframes do allow for substitution to other energy forms - as to politics, natGas/oil already get tons of subsidies iirc

2001 2018-02-21 19:56:34 Absolutely brutal stop run on all the rates up/stocks down trades on. They got the hawkish minutes they wanted, but got squeezed before the trade could go their way. $GLD now down, $EURO down, Oil down and $SPY not looking good. Market really does cause most pain to most people
2002 2018-02-21 19:56:21 Chavez was sending oil to Evo Morales & Bolivia. "Chávez gave away barrels of oil worth about 260 million euros according to the opposition. He financed his apologists Evo Morales in Bolivia& Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and he carried an ailing Cuban  regime on his back."

2014 2018-02-21 19:55:07 @LaTrioli TDP can take plastic, rubber, food scraps, ag waste, old tyres etc.  All Melbourne landfill waste would produce over $160 million worth of oil per year at $60/barrel.  More to come.
2015 2018-02-21 19:55:03 Tamanu oil is good, plus it corrects dark spots
2016 2018-02-21 19:54:57 That’s because your muses mingle, mine don’t. They all seperate like oil and water.
2017 2018-02-21 19:54:53 So, finally there is a true global energy market! Journey of rebirth for the American energy leadership is due primarily for the scratchy independent shale oil & gas producers of TX and OK. Nation owes a great dead of debt to them including to #AubreyMcClendon.
2018 2018-02-21 19:54:46 When you try to educate someone on the possible dangers of oil diffusers and dogs, but they absolutely refuse to believe you.

2025 2018-02-21 19:54:29 You’re giving him a lot of latitude that I don’t think he deserves. His invest.firm specializes in Russian/Asian oil . All the more reason why he should’ve been aware of Baranov being the head of investor relations at Rosneft. He co-founded his firm with a Russian oil executive.

2033 2018-02-21 19:53:07 The US doesn't need to run in, US oil production. Has increase to 10 million barrels per day. So no need to show interest in Jamaica. This is why no US oil company showed interest in Jamaica.

2035 2018-02-21 19:52:59 Ryan Killackey: Since the film has ended, it looks like the native people are seeking to work with the government and oil companies in order to remove the buffer zone around the reserve.
2036 2018-02-21 19:52:59 If the two oil seeps discovered are indeed in Trelawny I would have to join with the environmentalists in rejecting its exploitation in protection of our pristine north coast beaches
2037 2018-02-21 19:52:53 apple cider vinegar, raw (local) honey, lemon essential oil, castor oil, tea trea!
2038 2018-02-21 19:52:43 BP was state owned. BP is not state owned anymore. The price of oil isn't that important, it's how much you can get for the £, weak £ less oil than your competitors, higher prices than your competitors.
2039 2018-02-21 19:52:38 I’m at the oil changing place and apparently a creature has been storing nuts behind my glove department and idk him but I love u creature
2040 2018-02-21 19:52:30 Try CBD oil!!! We swear by it
2041 2018-02-21 19:52:25 GIRL YOU CAN DROP ME IN A POOL OF HOT OIL AND ILL STILL WANT TO WORK FOR YOU
2042 2018-02-21 19:52:19 Cause corporations run everything & they're greedy, don't want to change & don't care about the destruction of our environment. Oil, plastic is a byproduct of Big Oil, we all know they don't give a f**k.

2046 2018-02-21 19:51:27 Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4 and grease and line a 7-inch deep round cake tin
Whisk the sugar and eggs until light and fluffy and doubled in volume. This will take some time, so if you have an electric hand whisk, use it. Continue to whisk @ low speed & add coconut oil
2047 2018-02-21 19:51:07 Everyone’s mind is already made up regarding Russia. We are just waiting to see if congress will impeach. Focus on what else is happening. Economy, climate, courts, voting, immigration, oil drilling, healthcare - the list goes on and on.
2048 2018-02-21 19:51:02 FYI, the promise of a 'world class marine oil spill response regime' for BC doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the 'best in the world', like Alaska's. Just means that it'll compare favourably with response regimes for coasts around the world that face similar challenges & threats.

2056 2018-02-21 19:49:43 Okay, thank you. I think the oil works for me.

2082 2018-02-21 19:47:44 Restricting the flow of Oil into BC..... or......Restricting the flow of Wine into Alberta.   What’s the difference? Either way jobs are lost. Alberta should shut down & service the existing BC pipeline they already have highest Gas prices in N America! How bout $10. per Ltr gas?

Love the big ice too!

2101 2018-02-21 19:44:50 If you think Venezuela has dreadful troubles because of bad luck with oil prices and “ imperialist plots” you are sadly deluded
2102 2018-02-21 19:44:40 @cbcpolitics add the $3.2B we give big oil in subsidies to the oil patch losses.
2103 2018-02-21 19:44:36 Whereas any taxation from oil found in Scottish "water", has been given to corporations, WM cronies etc. WM is now filled with Tories (including labour and LibDem versions) who only look to increase their own, personal wealth. As per private health care investments.

2113 2018-02-21 19:43:37 UPDATE: A detailed geological report is to be submitted to GoJ following the discovery of two oil seeps at a location in the parish of Trelawny.  Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica, PCJ Chairman, Russell Hadeed says it's not yet known whether the oil seeps are significant.
2114 2018-02-21 19:43:34 And they’ll put him on a line with a couple of high energy guys who find instant chemistry and Oil look bad for another 11 years
2115 2018-02-21 19:43:28 Just trippped over on my omega 3 supplements. Luckily the injuries were only super-fish-oil
2116 2018-02-21 19:43:24 The last White House email (I subscribe- know your enemy) is full of rural development bs which I guess means oil, industry, destruction walls, death to wildlife. Anyone out there decipher it yet?

2118 2018-02-21 19:43:04 Legal palm oil is also problematic sir, if we look at Life Cycle Analysis of entire palm oil plantations, it sure will have more drawbacks than benefits
2119 2018-02-21 19:43:04 Just like he said we would be crazy to leave the oil in the ground.  The guys a real chameleon.
2120 2018-02-21 19:43:02 Because, oil and gas doesn’t want the people to force them to pay their fair share of taxes at the ballot, that’s why. They are owned by the oil and gas industry. #RestoreGPT to 7%!
2121 2018-02-21 19:43:01 Oil rubbed bronze is about £40 more than brown... so let’s go with that..
2122 2018-02-21 19:42:59 It is, however as an EV owner you get the choice of where that electric comes from via your supplier. I use 100% renewable. As you know, refining oil for petrol/diesel uses LOTS of elec, so reducing demand for fossil fuels will reduce emissions right the way back up the chain.
2123 2018-02-21 19:42:58 Big oil. Big Pharma. NRA. Planned Parenthood. All organizations who own our politicians. Everyone knows money influences politics. Not sure why that needs to be proven to you.
2124 2018-02-21 19:42:36 Just administered the first dose of cannabis oil. Treated myself too 
2125 2018-02-21 19:42:27 One mans cocky arrogance is another mans confidence. Rumor has it Barzal told Oil they'd be sorry if they didn't take him - cocky arrogance; and Yamamoto said same thing - confidence! Eye of the beholder. Organization failed Hall far more than Hall failed the organization.
2126 2018-02-21 19:42:27 Every time I get my oil changed I pray that I actually don’t need the things that I tell them I don’t need
2127 2018-02-21 19:42:21 Tried oil as don't smoke but only helped for a week
2128 2018-02-21 19:42:12 Senator:  Sanctions don’t work.  If you want to punish Russians for meddling in our elections, Drill Baby Drill including off coast of NJ to bring down the price of oil to destroy their economy.  That is the way to get Putin’s attention.  JM
2129 2018-02-21 19:42:09 Gies peace! Aberdeen has been on it’s arse for 3 years with the oil downturn and now Brexit (which we never voted for) is round the corner and all you care about is English dogs! How is that representing your constituents!?
2130 2018-02-21 19:42:05 Again Myth, if Scotland leaves it will no longer be UK oil, and SNP have increased their vote and alao took recent by-elections, Tories are down to third place. Recent polls show increase in indi voting intentions. Do keep up Flap Zappa

2147 2018-02-21 19:40:07 Once again just like with Big Pharma and Big Oil it comes down to money and Politics. You notice the ROOT to all of these problems always goes back to money being in Politics, Lobbying aka Legalized Bribery
2148 2018-02-21 19:40:02 Snake oil huckster.
2149 2018-02-21 19:39:56 Those were sarcastic quotations. In the next 10 years the tour will be full of people that overpower the oil with two hands. Bowling has a long tradition, the pba should’ve said learn to bowl proper or get out
2150 2018-02-21 19:39:55 Need to get an oil change  I need somebody to do it for me!
2151 2018-02-21 19:39:52 A Gentleman lately arrived from the East Indies being asked his opinion of the American Treaty with France replied, "It is Oil and Vinegar, which, I fear, will dress a most unpalatable salad for Old England."

2152 2018-02-21 19:39:49 Need an oil change ASAP
2153 2018-02-21 19:39:49 No worries Elizabeth, we got your back! Let's come back stronger and show twitter you can't mess with MAGA bots

2155 2018-02-21 19:39:38 Alberta's Q3 Fiscal Update comes out next week. Things to watch: 
-Focus on bringing down deficit
-Price of oil is up (budget based on $49/bbl WTI)
-but so is WCS differential (originally estimated at $16/bbl this fiscal yr, was optimistically narrowed to $12.10/bbl in Q2 update)
2156 2018-02-21 19:39:18 I mean, I personally believe the Fountain of Youth is in olive oil... But that's probably just the Italian in me ;)

2160 2018-02-21 19:38:51 Students from Boise High inquire about the use of medical marijuana and CBD oil as an alternative to opioids.  Panelists tippy toe around their response.  It has a place,  panelists concede.  #ccboi
2161 2018-02-21 19:38:49 Gas or oil...
2162 2018-02-21 19:38:41 Getting my oil changes and apparently I needed a new filter and wiper blades. This about to be the most expensive oil change I’ve ever had 
2163 2018-02-21 19:38:38 Agreed!  Keep pushing forward, I 120% support you.  I wish our governments at all levels would pose the challenge to our media to post the WTI oil price beside the WCS oil price, nightly.  Start the education, top down.  Great work Vivian.
2164 2018-02-21 19:38:26 I have 1/3rd of what I need to do today already finished. I also have to include finessing my way to the front of the line for an oil change unto the list. 
2165 2018-02-21 19:38:25 I came to get an oil change & they’re showing me a mustang they have in stock... omg
2166 2018-02-21 19:38:10 LOL Dem find oil or still just projection? I'm afraid that they will and then is pure problems and so so corruption a to ruin we.

2. Big Pharma
3. Big Ag
4. Big Guns
5. Big Oil

What do these things have in common? They all sell products that harm the public health. Profit first, public second. It’s the American way. The public must make THEMSELVES come first. Corporate “people” surely won’t.
2177 2018-02-21 19:36:29 It may be that eventually the knowledge and experience gained from these sort of failures mean that oil can be extracted commercially from this challenging area, that's how science progresses. But will it be UKOG who get us there? I suspect that they will be long gone by then.
2178 2018-02-21 19:36:01 Yes saving the planet will cost all a bit of money to go into: rebates to the poorer; to AB business, housing, & indiv’s for energy efficiency improvements; to research on cleaning up oil and transport; to NEW energy biz dev’t; etc, You got us oil-dependent. Your time has passed.
2179 2018-02-21 19:35:59 so, you dont want regulations that protect people, but you do want subsidies for corn/oil?

2181 2018-02-21 19:35:53 And that's with assumption that non-combustion use of oil and gas will double, and that 50% of EV *sales* in 2040 will still be hybrids.

If BP scenarios were more sensible on both counts, they would suggest peak demand far earlier than they currently indicate.

2219 2018-02-21 19:30:40 Sounds like a better deal than oil, when it comes to geopolitics. And since batteries not destroyed by use, after initial ramp up, recycling will be a huge source of materials. Also wouldn’t be surprised if higher prices led to new discoveries in other regions.
2220 2018-02-21 19:30:30 When the press goes after a member of the general public over this trumped up, McCarthyist, first amendment killing witch hunt, MSM is sending a message to people.

2239 2018-02-21 19:29:18 Nobody reads papers anymore Rachel Rachel, yer wasting money you Oil muppet
2240 2018-02-21 19:29:11 Lmfao. Came to get an oil change and forgot to turn the music down before i got out the car. 
2241 2018-02-21 19:29:05 Our friendship not solid enough for beard oil? Bet
2242 2018-02-21 19:28:29 I finally got my oil changed after saying that i was going to for 3 weeks & i feel accomplished 
2243 2018-02-21 19:28:25 Wait what? You do realize we have the electoral college because our founding fathers didn't trust the average citizen was intelligent or informed enough to vote for an appropriate pres candidate right? Also maybe kids today are just tired of fighting wars for oil.

2245 2018-02-21 19:28:21 I am not a fan of most 'snake oil' products but damn Seafoam seems to be consistently good at getting a cranky carburated engine going with a poor flowing & dirty fuel system. The Savage lives!*. (*TBD more so upon reg showing up and weather permitting for a good ride).
2246 2018-02-21 19:28:20 No more heat , get ride of the heat damage, Wear protective styles and use black caster oil and also use shampoo and conditioners that consist of no sulfate.
2247 2018-02-21 19:28:14 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas

2249 2018-02-21 19:28:13 Learning how to change my own oil and completely replacing both my headlights Friday. Things like this boosting my independence even more..
2250 2018-02-21 19:28:08 Im just slicker than niggas Olive Oil...
2251 2018-02-21 19:27:59 Boiled yam and red oil for dinner 
2252 2018-02-21 19:27:58 Gotta tell Andrew seh Jamaica need fi look like Wakanda when the oil money hits.
2253 2018-02-21 19:27:56 Hussein, go home! I know you want dem dirty oil dollas but you’re not doing yourself a favor supporting a government that proudly hacks and illegally streams the contants of a sports channel.
2254 2018-02-21 19:27:45 Reading through BPs Q4 results, you can tell this is a company preparing for a future without oil. It’s quite incredible.
2255 2018-02-21 19:27:35 I am Iranian, China has destroyed our economy, not US sanctions
Today, the whole world must unite against China
North Korea is directly affected by China.
China uses the military power of Russia and Iran's oil against the United States
2256 2018-02-21 19:27:31 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
2257 2018-02-21 19:27:21 Afterall he is the 2-time and defending champion of the Lucas Oil Chili Bowl Nationals and current full-time NASCAR Xfinity Series driver for Joe Gibbs Racing. @CBellRacing @JoeGibbsRacing @NASCAR @NASCAR_Xfinity @LucasOil @ChiliBowlKickIt
2258 2018-02-21 19:27:07 These are awesome ideas! I've used cilantro, avocado, minced garlic, ginger, balsamic vinegar, whole grain mustard and water to make an amazing, creamy dressing. No need to even add oil.. avocado brings the fat!   #ChapCareChat #HeartHealthMonth #AmericanHeartMonth
2259 2018-02-21 19:26:54 Totally agree. This is how the oil industry feels as well.
2260 2018-02-21 19:26:38 Keep watching corporately owned, (w/ corporate interests; oil, big pharma, gold) #sheep I'll address the kid in another tweet. At work.  #maga #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder @TallahForTrump @RealCandaceO

2262 2018-02-21 19:26:20 The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (O. G. R. A.) has warned that the existing deposits of natural gas in Pakistan may be depleted by 2030.
2263 2018-02-21 19:25:58 we don’t need more oil - foreign or domestic; we don’t need more oil production across CA, OR, WA, NV, & AZ; get it?
2264 2018-02-21 19:25:50 I’ve been waiting for my oil change for 2.5 hours and I’m about to go insane
2265 2018-02-21 19:25:43 Everyone is waiting to see Shale's response to $60 oil.
2266 2018-02-21 19:25:41 @VICE had a great show on how the illegal burning of the rain forest in order to clear the way for palm oil plantations exacerbates an already critical problem with climate change and endangers so many species.
2267 2018-02-21 19:25:24 Even ignoring the fact that crypto is bullshit they're basing it on oil prices and basing a currency on oil is a terrible idea as oil prices are in the shit right now
2268 2018-02-21 19:25:20 Nigeria has oil. Coo pan dem... 
2269 2018-02-21 19:25:17 Landy only has a wee advantage on those deep rutted roads. Also a Jimny keeps all it's oil on the inside of the motor, transmission and diffs...
2270 2018-02-21 19:25:17 Gotcha Swebs, hopefully they stop messing with ya 
2271 2018-02-21 19:25:11 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #CADEM #XB4AG
2272 2018-02-21 19:25:08 Wait...there’s oil? #prosperity
2273 2018-02-21 19:25:03 The waiter at the place I’m eating at smells like motor oil 
2274 2018-02-21 19:24:50 And the crap is really bad for you. Don't buy food that contains palm oil. That could make the difference. Tell manufacturer why you will not use.
2275 2018-02-21 19:24:47 Players can thrive when they are provided with coaches who guide, teach, communicate, encourage, foster development and maturity, etc !? What a novel concept! Imo this speaks volumes to just how bad Oil mgmt and coaches were in the D of D
2276 2018-02-21 19:24:30 Finally, FAAC also gets taxes and royalties from the sale of oil and gas. So that also bumps up the FAAC figure nicely. 

The end. 

No questions please. I am going to watch United sink or swim. #HalaMadrid
2277 2018-02-21 19:24:17 They can buy from whoever they want. They choose to buy foreign oil.
2278 2018-02-21 19:24:13 lol some new bitch is complaining about getting dye oil on her MISS ME jeans...lol FIRST OF ALL who in the FUCK would wear their "nice ass pants" to a F A C T O R Y environment? 

YOU GO GLENN COCO 
2279 2018-02-21 19:24:10 thank you.
2280 2018-02-21 19:24:02 Is there ever such a thing as “just an oil change” when you take your car to the mechanic?
2281 2018-02-21 19:23:58 Thank fuck you didn't leak your oil tank this time around
2282 2018-02-21 19:23:52 If you want to feel like a goddess put bubble soap, a glitter bath bomb, rose water and eucalyptus oil in your tub and start fucking living
2283 2018-02-21 19:23:50 Today in Oil City Pa which is a republican area YMCA I was told by ex manager Terry  to not play Fox news in the work out area They all said that Fox News is all lies. I asked her to name a lie,just one,and she was mum. I reported her to mgt and was told I can watch anything  .

2286 2018-02-21 19:23:44 Finally making available 30ML Beard oil bottles
2287 2018-02-21 19:23:38 You dont own a share in the actual player. You own a share in the form of future. There is a futures market for everything from gold & silver to Oil. You are trading on its future performance
2288 2018-02-21 19:23:32 That ain't our oil no mo
2289 2018-02-21 19:23:31 Are you a real person who’s been brainwashed by wealthy entrenched oil and gun corps to think the cost for dead kids is worth it, or a bott?
2290 2018-02-21 19:23:13 The vanishing point that was created by Andrea Mantegna in the Dead Christ makes you look from the bottom to the top of the painting. We are representing Mary Magdalen because we are at the feet of Jesus and the jar of oil is placed near his head. #sacart1B
2291 2018-02-21 19:23:10 And processed palm oil is amongst the most unhealthy cooking oils. So we’re hurting the health of our planet and our species
2292 2018-02-21 19:23:01 Y hoy por primera vez veo E.T. 
2293 2018-02-21 19:22:59 Yes Jason and they will get much richer off of cheap Canadian oil as long as we only have one customer.
2294 2018-02-21 19:22:42 I'm also out of cooking oil.
2295 2018-02-21 19:22:40 Coconut oil = best tanning oil
2296 2018-02-21 19:22:37 There's not enough oil in guns 
2297 2018-02-21 19:22:35 I once read a quote by a Native American that said something like nature is the only true religion everything else id snake oil.....
2298 2018-02-21 19:22:13 Because the population exploded by 50%??    But they probably could have made better use of the oil money to diversify into a stronger economy & full employment.
2299 2018-02-21 19:22:09 Watched a documentary on palm oil production. Big problems on several levels.

2300 2018-02-21 19:22:08 "We Don't Give A Frack!" #Show Peetz CO 7/14/18 Squeezing the last drop of oil from unstable shale and sandstone assures that Colorado will contribute its share of the force required to rock a nation! Note haulers include ALEX INGRAM, THE DIRTY DANS, BROS GOFFO & MOBURT LINESSE.
2301 2018-02-21 19:22:07 ISO: someone to pick me up while my oil is getting changed so I can go get my nails done lol. 
2302 2018-02-21 19:22:07 So my mini diet appears to be working. I refuse to ever give up carbs, but Ive been cutting back on them. For lunches, Ive just been baking chicken/veggies with no oil. Just seasoned well. Adding abit of pasta sauce or teriyaki sauce depending. Down a belt hole already!
2303 2018-02-21 19:22:05 You dont own a share in the actual player. You own a share in the form of future. There is a futures market for everything from gold & silver to Oil. You are trading on its future performance
2304 2018-02-21 19:22:05 Apostle Q and English it's water and oil 
2305 2018-02-21 19:21:58 This beard oil is really about to change my life
2306 2018-02-21 19:21:43 Twice!
2307 2018-02-21 19:21:41 Just like sugar was not harmful, a few decades back, as per trustworthy studies; or, too much oil was responsible for heart attacks, and now it is not anymore... same kinda research, I guess.
2308 2018-02-21 19:21:37 Yes, thank you.
2309 2018-02-21 19:21:35 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
2310 2018-02-21 19:21:27 from 3am midnight calls to 3am burning the midnight oil for assignments. kill me already. 
2311 2018-02-21 19:21:24 Life comes at you fast. One minute you think you’re influencing US policy, the next you’re on a TV shopping channel trying to sell snake oil. It must be killing him inside.
2312 2018-02-21 19:21:17 I’m takin all these pictures for my kids so when I’m dead an gone they’ll know what daddy did, spending half of my life with no grass beneath my feet,they call me oil field trash and that’s alright with me
2313 2018-02-21 19:21:03 Hasta ahora me doy cuenta de la influencia que #stevenspielberg ha tenido en mi desde pequeña #tiburon #encuentrocercano #jurassicpark
2314 2018-02-21 19:20:51 Jamaica and Guyana have oil... let me just drape myself in my flags
2315 2018-02-21 19:20:38 احيانا الوحدة بتكون افضل من لمة ملهاش لازمة
2316 2018-02-21 19:20:30 Boom
2317 2018-02-21 19:20:27 From the bloody coups to a war that killed millions of kids to the wasteful era of oil boom to the murtala assassination to shagari's stupidity to Buhari's gestapo regime to IBB's incredible looting to Abacha's Mafioso and heavily corrupt regime..Nigeria's history is shit.
2318 2018-02-21 19:20:24 AYE CUZ BE ON DECK WIT THE OIL BURNERS TOO

2320 2018-02-21 19:20:18 Fomc minutes signal all fed officials agree on aggressive rate hikes. Positive for dollar, but very bearish on Stocks and commodities including Gold and crude oil. Dow and Nasdaq pared some of gains
2321 2018-02-21 19:20:15 WANT 20% OFF A RIG? Stop by  @NaturalRxSWPDX  and buy 2 Grams of oil and bring in your receipt! Offer only valid TODAY!
2322 2018-02-21 19:20:14 And why does vegetable oil, an industrial product, get a free pass?
2323 2018-02-21 19:19:59 Got my oil filter fixed for free, my mom & sister fly in today, boutta give my baby a little spa day & it's nice as shit out today. Gonna be a good day
2324 2018-02-21 19:19:55 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. U anoint my head with oil my cup overflows. Psalm23:5
2325 2018-02-21 19:19:52 Getting an oil change. They have local Fox News in where the discussion is “do you shower like everyone else” 3 adult idiots talking about how they wash themselves. This is “news”
2326 2018-02-21 19:19:51 Nothing says love like a fat oil based worst vegetable possible..heart disease cancer diabetes....yep typical! Why not just use a big Mac.
2327 2018-02-21 19:19:47 Pretty sure that one of our industrious scammers has sold 1000 barrels of Jamaican oil already
2328 2018-02-21 19:19:39 I've been having good skin days and I think it's thanks to this Sunday Riley oil I've been using. It makes your skin so soft and hydrated!
2329 2018-02-21 19:19:35 I agree with Munger on this one. Leave it in the ground, particularly while we're not getting a good price for it anyway:

"go very slow in producing domestic oil and not mind at all if we pay prices that look ruinous for foreign oil. It’s going to get way worse later."
2330 2018-02-21 19:19:34 My wife has early onset arthritis, hereditary.
For the last three weeks she has been taking spoon of hemp seed oil morning and night
Says the difference is very noticeable in terms of reduction of pain.
Worth a shot?
2331 2018-02-21 19:19:04 (I owned one at some point. Meatier than a cleaver; you hammer the top edge to prise the hardened linseed oil away from the timber). As a would-be contrarian I naturally want another restoration, which might restore that yawning gap between Bacon and (?) Velasquez.
2332 2018-02-21 19:19:01 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
2333 2018-02-21 19:19:00 I want to see Farage, Johnson, Mogg etc in the dock of the court of public opinion when their version of Brexit sends this country into a downward spiral for years to come! Of course Farage will use more snake oil to slip himself away as usual!
2334 2018-02-21 19:18:57 Right? Like, how am I supposed to take these people seriously? Also, they seem to think apple cider vinegar and coconut oil are going to make them immortal or something?
2335 2018-02-21 19:18:54 Palm oil causes cancer so you might be right
2336 2018-02-21 19:18:47 Still killing it with the spelling I see.
We're a PLC means we have the stability to last 100 years.
How long can Oil money last you?
You haven't won anything YET.
Your 15 points lead won't mean anything in August.
Come back when you catch up to our 20 titles, ok?
2337 2018-02-21 19:18:44 still cant follow.
2338 2018-02-21 19:18:36 Yessss oil slay
2339 2018-02-21 19:18:31 We do not agree. @ordinaryskinco believe simple, basic, and healthy is best. Not chemicals, cheap marketing and snake oil.
2340 2018-02-21 19:18:29 did the democrats hack @Twitter? Hell, no... they work for @Twitter.
2341 2018-02-21 19:18:13 The entire crib smells like tea tree oil & I just dont know how to feel..
2342 2018-02-21 19:18:05 To my oily skin girls, how do you keep your makeup looking matte and oil free?
2343 2018-02-21 19:17:43 I would rather consider the independent source, Conference Board of Canada, than a propaganda publication funded by a US anti oil sands foundation. Especially given our anti oil government, who is looking at discrediting anything they can with regards to our energy industry
2344 2018-02-21 19:17:41 Not enuf time left in oil biz now imo. Solar and batteries r coming fast.
2345 2018-02-21 19:17:35 True, but still dwarfs *by far* the amount of spending by pharma, insurance, oil/gas, and numerous other industries.
2346 2018-02-21 19:17:34 I’m 6,000 miles over due for an oil change, sorry lola
2347 2018-02-21 19:17:27 Pumpkin seed, or motor oil
2348 2018-02-21 19:17:21 What l meant was that for some or alot of ppl, they believe most of the money or easy money is tied in some way to access to or control of power (government) ..which is what l meant by game in town ( oil and gas among things ) .seems to me one of the root cause to your point
2349 2018-02-21 19:17:21 Added literally just one clove of garlic to my fried rice and now it tastes only like garlic. It’s no longer onion egg fried rice in olive oil with salt and pepper. It’s just garlic rice.
2350 2018-02-21 19:17:10 ANNNNDA my final point is the easiest argument,,no matter the hate/croissant everything else TrumpsHaters bring at us there's one thing that makes it meaningless,,,the alternative was Hillary"ShadyAsShit"Clinton A woman that wanted to end coal an restrict Oil here an would-
2351 2018-02-21 19:17:05 currently trying to convince my mom to get her hands on CBD oil for the sake of her health lol
2352 2018-02-21 19:17:02 1)EFCC QUIZZES EIGHT SUSPECTED OIL THIEVES. 

Eight suspected oil thieves and a vessel, MV MAC CLINT, are being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for their involvement in illegal oil bunkering.
2353 2018-02-21 19:16:58 Hatomugi, nature republic cleansing oil, innisfree sunscreen and sheet mask. Total rm132.08. Yeayyy jumaat/sabtu aku bankin 
2354 2018-02-21 19:16:58 please Sir focus on refineries and power supply. Solve these two problems and win 2019. Don't allow NASS and oil unions to distract
2355 2018-02-21 19:16:57 It is starting to look like the beginning rounds of civil war.
2356 2018-02-21 19:16:25 Next time cut up some chicken and cook it in some canola oil and then cook it all together
2357 2018-02-21 19:16:21 You can strain the seeds, its hair gel too, add coconut oil.
2358 2018-02-21 19:16:20 Came back to work and got 3 additional preps to the 4 this morning and then two oil changes showed up. Still feel like I’m chillin tho 
2359 2018-02-21 19:16:17 Deafening silence from leaders on the African continent on ongoings in Syria . We will bite the mullet when oil prices start hitting all time@high and our foreign reserves get washed away as a function of that war. It's dangerous to pretend we do not care.
2360 2018-02-21 19:16:02 احسن احسن
2361 2018-02-21 19:16:00 @shakeshackUK can you tell me if you fry your shallots in the same oil as you fry your chicken and fries. Thanks.
2362 2018-02-21 19:15:58 IIRC, 'peak oil' was the point at which we would be using it up faster than we were finding new fields. 'Peak trans' to me is when TRAs use up society's empathy (by behaving appallingly) faster than they can generate it (by playing the victim).
2363 2018-02-21 19:15:55 Disagree with Ross McCafferty - Milo isn't better than this (hawking supplements) - he's always been a bit of a snake oil salesman - with him being the snake  portion of that.
2364 2018-02-21 19:15:45 It’s often cos they’re a bit on the greasy/sugary end due to liquid oil for frying and powdered sugar in the cheese. I use neither. ;)
2365 2018-02-21 19:15:40 Snake Oil! 
2366 2018-02-21 19:15:37 My artist told me he uses coconut oil because it doesn't soak in immediately. Also told me to not use too much and not too little. Difficult finding the right amount for the first one. 
And I was allergic to the wound creme stuff I had...
2367 2018-02-21 19:15:34 Jamaica has oil and I’m only filled with dread at how we’re gunna eff this one up, too
2368 2018-02-21 19:15:21 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this February? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.

2371 2018-02-21 19:15:13 Maybe you should try more organic stuff? If you have a very sensitive skin it might react badly on commercially made skin care products (rip English, sorry). Stuff like Greek yoghurt or olive oil are really good! Though it depends on your skin type :0
2372 2018-02-21 19:15:09 ya need the real CBD oil not the stuff from Holland and Barrett - this is coming from a H&B advocate
2373 2018-02-21 19:15:08 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
2374 2018-02-21 19:15:08 I had that happen. Hot oil on my eyelids. Nice.

2376 2018-02-21 19:15:07 I’m Rey go get oil don’t leave with out me
2377 2018-02-21 19:14:58 everybody is entitled to sell their own snake oil - the dilemma begins when well-informed / educated ppl endorse corruption and lay the foundations of fascism - no one is able to answer this simple question: where's the money trail?
2378 2018-02-21 19:14:57 ¿Si hay jeans Diesel, por qué no hay camisas Fuel Oil? (????)

2387 2018-02-21 19:13:48 I should hope so!
2388 2018-02-21 19:13:46 Welcomes Seanna...Oregano oil definatly got rid of my cold....my sis was at the dr this am in Galway..her GP..she wanted her vit D levels checked he said GP dont check for that i was not impressed..as she was havin bloods taken anyways...smh
2389 2018-02-21 19:13:44 I wonder if people realize we about 10-15 years from actually producing oil.. Which is just enough time for democracy to kick in #OilInJamaica
2390 2018-02-21 19:13:24 Both OIL and GOLD spike higher and touch 200MA on 15min chart and pull back. I doubt they will go higher. USD breaks below support and begins long needed correction lower.
2391 2018-02-21 19:13:20 Not taking any vitamins. Just applying coconut oil several times a day and washing it off with soap once a day.
2392 2018-02-21 19:13:16 No way he’s one of a kind. We’ve got millions of hateful bigoted snake oil salesmen in this country

2396 2018-02-21 19:12:39 I needed an oil change and found out I needed transmission fluid it cost $40 for the oil change and $180 for the transmission fluid, I was hurt.
2397 2018-02-21 19:12:34 The guy who does my oil change always gives me a discount and throws in a free car wash and it feels like Christmas every time 
2398 2018-02-21 19:12:32 We found oil? Where?
2399 2018-02-21 19:12:28 One major concern with the water in the great lakes is also the oil pipelines that run on the bottom in several locations. If those ever rupture, it would be very very bad because of how fast the oil would spread. Saw an interesting documentary a while back.
2400 2018-02-21 19:12:22 It’s just a CBD oil I got at Village Health Foods!! It’s supposed to be like a dietary supplement but my friend that works there has been using it on her skin for a long time and suggested it. It’s magical!
2401 2018-02-21 19:12:14 Don’t use coconut oil on your skin. Coconut oil is comedogenic.

2405 2018-02-21 19:11:49 Every single time I take my car for an oil change more needs to be done 
2406 2018-02-21 19:11:45 We would be far better off without the parasitic religious class feeding on peoples fears to not only fund their existence.  They are quite simply selling snake oil and making you pay for the privilege.

2421 2018-02-21 19:10:37 If it is a difference of degree, could you graph out the Holocaust denier/ murderous flair sherif vs plain old snake oil salesman hierarchy for me?

2422 2018-02-21 19:10:29 Really?! I never thought to use cbd oil on my face WOW! Jayden's juice??
2423 2018-02-21 19:10:27 Well $10 bbl oil is good for consumers in Canada as cheap oil = cheaper energy for consumers which helps other parts and industries of the economy.
We have to have diverse economy and not just an energy driven one!

However, we formulated the Whipped Argan Oil Face Butter specifically for the face, which has all kinds of good for your face ingredients, so recommend that over the body butter for face.

2479 2018-02-21 19:04:21 @joerogan hi Joe from the UK, serious question on the subject of cbd oil which has just exploded in popularity because a major popular health store (holland and barret) is selling a 2.75% cbd oil from a Dutch health company (Jacob hooy). Is this strong enough for health effects.
2480 2018-02-21 19:04:20 Regarding the Compassionate use act. He allowed companies from out of state to  produce CBD oil for #epileptic Texans, Instead of Texans. He and the majority of those we elected are nothing but monkeys dancing to the Organist tune.
P.S. I  have Intractable #Epilepsy. Let try blue
2481 2018-02-21 19:04:15 BP Energy Outlook: A 2040 global ban on the internal combustion engine (ala CA's #AB1745) would have little impact on oil demand or GHGs because it would be offset by lower investment in other forms of vehicle efficiency.
2482 2018-02-21 19:04:07 The reply from the State department is correct. Both Trump for his real estate business and Tillerson for his Exxon business, which has invested half trullion$ in Russian oil exploration, take orders from Putin. This time, at least, the reply was correct: “ask the Tusdians”.
2483 2018-02-21 19:03:59 Snake. Oil. $$$
2484 2018-02-21 19:03:51 Isn't Kenney ignoring the fact that these are two different kinds of 'oil"?
2485 2018-02-21 19:03:36 I followed you 
2486 2018-02-21 19:03:35 Some recipe I saw online. I just massaged olive oil on the chopped kale and threw it in a saucepan. Threw in garlic, onions, pimento, chive, chadon beni, thyme... well green seasoning. Mix it up. Cover for like 5 minutes. Done. Throw in a dash of scorpion pepper and good to go
2487 2018-02-21 19:03:31 tip of the day: if your eyelashes fall out/break off cause of mascara, put castor oil on them every night when you take off your makeup !!! it'll make them grow back super long & pretty
2488 2018-02-21 19:03:27 I certainly understand frustration with tax money going to policies we disagree with (mass incarceration, oil subsidies) but I still don't see how a moral opposition to death allows the political support of an idea like the 2A.
2489 2018-02-21 19:03:24 We r sorry, cuz u can’t realize that lots of studies, articles, reports have been made about it, and its a fact, the increase of CO2 was exponential after the industrial revolution, when we start to burn coal and oil on a massive scale, and the temperature went up acordding to it

2532 2018-02-21 18:58:48 I praise this Alberta industry for being one of the most responsible in the world at extraction. Maybe the virtue signalers could give a look outside of Canada's boarders at the oil being imported a great cost and damage from other countries.

2554 2018-02-21 18:54:57 But *does* it taste good? I mean, I've nuked eggs before. They tend to be drier than the Sahara and runny as the Amazon all at once. Though if you add oil it DOES sometimes lead to perfect puffy eggs - which are yum.
2555 2018-02-21 18:54:51 Yah, google the Wallstreet guys who are profiting off of VZ's economic woes...some of these bond traders decided to not profit off the the country's starvation and despair.  Maduro is doing this because of US sanctions and the previous drop in Oil prices + corruption.

2612 2018-02-21 18:48:46 That’s way overstating the case. The effect of oil prices on the overall US economy is now close to neutral, not anywhere near petro-state (or import-dependent consumer) territory.
2613 2018-02-21 18:48:42 Venezuela proplems have as much to do with oil being their only product as it does with communism. oil prices dropped and their production dropped they had no other products.  The give aways didn't help , but Saudi Arabia will have the same problems without oil.

2643 2018-02-21 18:45:27 All currencies crashed in 08 meaning product prices would stay equiv. If we still had BP we'd get oil at a reduced price when oil high or £ low. £ dropping also increases cost of import product as well as fuel. Pretty simple really.

2658 2018-02-21 18:44:02 But instead legitimate thoughtful critiques, then I question you objective reading abilities. Do you regularly attack your colleagues with gendered slights when you can and then respond respectfully to Oil Men who validate Erin’s reporting? Seems interesting that he can accept

2660 2018-02-21 18:43:59 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #CADEM #XB4AG
2661 2018-02-21 18:43:48 Iraq Oil Reports has not disassociated from Patrick. Where are you getting your information? He left to move to Athens after working for them for years.
2662 2018-02-21 18:43:44 Just a taste of warm weather and my skin is already on OIL!!! So over it.
2663 2018-02-21 18:43:41 Whole chapter on donuts and frying and benefits of coconut oil in my book <3
2664 2018-02-21 18:43:36 I have seen predictions of another oil price crash in 2023 due to electric vehicle adoption.  It just needs to be enough to reduce oil demand. Go Tesla! Another factor is the electrification/hybridization of popular models.  (2020 hybrid F150 and Mustang plus entire Volvo fleet)
2665 2018-02-21 18:43:31 You forgot to mention that the inside of his skull was just like Canada itself: Mostly empty space, and that if it weren’t right next to the USA, Russia and China would be having a war for oil. Canadian oil.
2666 2018-02-21 18:43:23 Doughnuts don’t get refrigerated for other reasons (tends to speed staling of bread/cake products), but I fry them in coconut oil too!
2667 2018-02-21 18:43:21 Parker Kligerman rotates his tires every oil change
2668 2018-02-21 18:43:15 We didn’t have oil under the PNP... I’m just saying lol 
2669 2018-02-21 18:43:11 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
2670 2018-02-21 18:43:10 Difficulty is all about perspective. Animals that get caught in oil slicks are very hard to clean, but real easy to fry.
2671 2018-02-21 18:43:06 Vagina facials do exist ladies. 
Make sure you use toner after every wash & oil it up. 
Im serious.

2673 2018-02-21 18:43:02 Fear monger and snake oil salesman #BillyGraham died today. He is best remembered as being the template for such scumbag scam artists as Bakker, Falwell & Crefflo. Your legacy is long Mr. Graham. I hope you’re getting what you deserve for eternity.
2674 2018-02-21 18:42:44 cinnamon + coconut oil + coffee and ya got urself a nice bev
2675 2018-02-21 18:42:38 it's amazing how every single one of these people has a side-biz selling literal snake oil because their fan base is entirely too stupid to get the subtext
2676 2018-02-21 18:42:35 I was ready to leave the usa when trump got the election, because I know what raised its ugly head to gain power.  Most of us know the good ol boys and what they are about.   
Big Oil ... BO the stink that infuses greedy men.
2677 2018-02-21 18:42:28 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
2678 2018-02-21 18:42:27 Wa yabaka? 
2679 2018-02-21 18:42:25  all this time man had to eat bread with olive oil for a week after that
2680 2018-02-21 18:42:24 Is it bad that I don’t feel even a tad bit optimistic about this oil discovery?
2681 2018-02-21 18:42:21 Superman saves a lot of people in the oil rig before he utters ONE F**KING WORD IN #ManOfSteel ... He was saving people in DCEU before we the audience saw him speak

u tarnished him as not having enough hope & optimism @geoffjohns !!

Do the right thing now

2682 2018-02-21 18:42:20 Ever heard of rape seed oil? A rape is a kind of fruit I think. Unfortunately.
2683 2018-02-21 18:42:16 I thought that you were getting your head down??? ;)
Bike club 2nite so oil not be hanging around.

2687 2018-02-21 18:41:43 When Eye’m listening to marvin Gaye eye feel like Eye should be sitting down in a bamboo chair (right leg over left) wit  a glass of Hennessy in my hand and a cigar wit incense dipped in tea tree oil burning throughout the air
2688 2018-02-21 18:41:42 I just made an olive oil and thyme loaf and it is rising as we speak. I don't have a problem.
2689 2018-02-21 18:41:39 Jamaica, China, United States and United Kingdom walks into a bar....who gets the oil?
2690 2018-02-21 18:41:38 Oil is ok. It’s carbs that’s bad:)
2691 2018-02-21 18:41:32 "think" and bernie can't be in the same sentence. He is a stupid, ego driven snake oil salesman. Can we just give him a reality show on cable and be done with him?
2692 2018-02-21 18:41:09 Wow they just found an oil reserve in jamaica. USA bouta come through and steal all that shit
2693 2018-02-21 18:41:02 Billy Graham was a homophobic and privately anti-Semitic snake oil salesman. That's all he was.
2694 2018-02-21 18:41:01 I stand with Xavier Becerra because he’s fighting Big Oil, Wall Street, and Donald Trump head-on in court! #FightingAndWinning #XB4AG
2695 2018-02-21 18:41:01 What it’s like to be me : I look forward to eating Brussels sprouts with special oil on them at dinner time
2696 2018-02-21 18:40:45 Agree...I havent seen it for about 10yrs..but i always remember the aggresive guy with the beard i think he gets in the semi finals...and he pulled out a small tanker of castrol gtx oil and drunk it...When i watched it in the cinema when i was a kid...i was like Wow..hes hard..
2697 2018-02-21 18:40:34 It’s like you eat 80% fat and like 5% carbs so yea basically a lot of meat and oil. No pasta, potatoes and fruit I believe.
2698 2018-02-21 18:40:28 リナちゃんどした？考え事か？可愛いけど無理すんなよ？(なでなで
2699 2018-02-21 18:40:23 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to Goldman Sachs. Either that, or put it on eBay
2700 2018-02-21 18:40:16 shame!!!! Importing fuel for an oil producing nation is it an achievement?
2701 2018-02-21 18:40:12 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2702 2018-02-21 18:40:12 Oil changes, break jobs, all that.
2703 2018-02-21 18:40:06 State oil company @Petrotrinnews is performing in the bottom quartile of international industry benchmarks,  “the lowest of the low”, according the the board, presenting at a @TTParliament JSC Committee on Energy @Newsday_TT
2704 2018-02-21 18:40:05 It's funny cuz as soon as I walk in, he's like "so what do you think about Mueller?" Then I talk about the hypocrisy of Dems and Repubs and recommend @jimmy_dore and @corbettreport to him. I wonder if he's seen How Big Oil Conquered the World yet.
2705 2018-02-21 18:40:00 Waiting on @PDPhillipsJa to say he is going to fight to ensure Jamaica retains most of the benefits from the oil find.
2706 2018-02-21 18:39:46 You'll buy the whole olive oil popcorn! but you'll only need the EDGE!
2707 2018-02-21 18:39:39 its sad in the 80s people bitched and protested B.C. for its clear cut forrest practices yet ignore the oil sands .
2708 2018-02-21 18:39:23 Gun bans are not as popular as you think they are and thus will never pass. By persistently proposing thwm despite this fact, you are indeed not taking your gun control crusade seriously.
2709 2018-02-21 18:39:13 Many people have asked a question of how oil may become a curse? Here is the thing i am going to derive an example from my line of business, I am a freight forwarder when this project of gas gets in full gear, you will find that they will need the service of transport
2710 2018-02-21 18:39:07 Good thing a nuh d chiney dem find d oil, we kno it wud disappear like the hold discussion the other day
2711 2018-02-21 18:39:02 Oil is located in Turkana,most kenyans may not be interested in Turkana that much bt they love the oil
2712 2018-02-21 18:38:49 is coconut oil an option? I use it as lotion when I have it in the house. sometimes I even cook with it.
2713 2018-02-21 18:38:48 Congratulations to the Olive Oil Pantry on their Ribbon Cutting!
2714 2018-02-21 18:38:34 I ain't the one who forced yall to go get a Striker who's got Nigeria's oil right reserve on his head and French olofinjana
2715 2018-02-21 18:38:25 Nobody effin believes me, but we're heading into the next commodities super cycle. 

gold, oil, lithium/cobalt, silver.
2716 2018-02-21 18:38:23 Oil Change: 
2717 2018-02-21 18:38:22 AFAIK ExxonMobil_UK, Like BP Oil UK have no research labs in Europe any more.  Only Quality Control Testing at Fawley & Grangemouth.
Don't forget BP owned Mobil 1 brand for a short while as part of the global break up of Mobil during Exxon merger/takeover.
2718 2018-02-21 18:38:13 I gotcha' - you see me as fllwng?
2719 2018-02-21 18:38:11 My Hairstyle For Work Lately Has Been Wet Hair FT. Coconut Oil 
2720 2018-02-21 18:38:08 When girls cry, they have mascara and eyeliner run down their face. But when I cry, it's grease and oil. And it's a lot harder to get off. I can't not handle the thought of losing you forever. Please don't do this to me
2721 2018-02-21 18:37:57 He's a liar! He graduated from a Cali school years ago! It's FAKE!
2722 2018-02-21 18:37:53 We finding oil is not great for Jamaica or Jamaicans at all
2723 2018-02-21 18:37:47 Tried to buy some snake oil from a guy and he gave me some other shit. I was like...you fuckin snake oil salesman
2724 2018-02-21 18:37:33 Our Govt is doing anything about it because big oil owns them.
2725 2018-02-21 18:37:32 Frying chicken is so easy though as long as you 1) season it right 2) give it an even coat 3) don’t have the oil too high.
2726 2018-02-21 18:37:28 Nigerians the only way to have steady light and fuel is to remove @GEJonathan .And I promise you in 6months Nigeria will be swimming in crude oil and fuel.Buhari will pay you all N5,000 monthly for being jobless. Youth will be gainfully employed with our 3m jobs a year" -B.Tinubu
2727 2018-02-21 18:37:19 May not be actors but they sure are speaking from a script and not their heart
2728 2018-02-21 18:37:19 omg I got this flowerbomb scented oil dupe & it smells JUST LIKE it. i’m so shook
2729 2018-02-21 18:37:18 Probably about two teaspoons of oil. Nonetheless, let’s see what happens...
2730 2018-02-21 18:37:16 We don't need their damm oil no more. Deal NK a bomb in the heart of one of their stupid band playing marches and get rid of the little rocket man and.most of their arsenal with one shot. And lastly. McCabe, Rosenstein, Sturk and all Obama leftover's bye bye
2731 2018-02-21 18:37:03 "Retail Politician" -- equivalent to a "Snake Oil Salesman"!! 
2732 2018-02-21 18:37:01 In my opinion,government shld nt do any business except basic primary needs like railways, oil refineries or similar other.All bank shld be privatised.
2733 2018-02-21 18:37:00 Michael Flynn and his son were notorious for sharing conspiracy theories. The right wing is built on it. FFS,  Dotard gave Alex Jones a shout out. That guy is snake oil and poison. #rightwingnutjobs #gopterrorism
2734 2018-02-21 18:36:37 I wish I had your sense of humor.
2735 2018-02-21 18:36:33 Sure do: when will you make the oil and natural gas companies pay their taxes and clean up their messes?
2736 2018-02-21 18:36:29 If I’m feeling lazy I chop up a load of veg and meats and add some curry/chilli powder, dash of sesame oil and loads of garlic with it. But if I’m feeling extra dirty a little bit of grated cheese whilst frying the rice and kimchi is good too although others would disagree 
2737 2018-02-21 18:36:25 This is awesome.
Giant demand for CBD oil!
Pre-order important !!!
New production is running
2738 2018-02-21 18:36:19 No NRA money; No big pharma money; No big oil money; No foreign government money; No super PACS. Let’s elect officials who serve the people and the country not the interests of big business.
2739 2018-02-21 18:36:11 HOW COME WHEN I DECIDE TO CHANGE MY OIL IT RAINS LIKE HELL?!?
2740 2018-02-21 18:36:06 ummmmmm I just learned that a bunch of companies sell FAKE OLIVE OIL and its this huge scam?!? ? ?? ?!? !! honestly im so shook, i think im taking the rest of the day off.
2741 2018-02-21 18:35:56 But regardless, still gonna need experts to extract the oil. I don't think it's a bad deal overall. The licence is to be renewed soon. They can maybe adjust
2742 2018-02-21 18:35:51 Any constituents concerned about recent oil spillage at Tottenham Marsh and Lee Navigation please contact @EnvAgencySE on 0800 80 70 60 (Freephone, 24 hour hotline). I am in regular contact with Environment Agency and will continue to monitor the clean-up process
2743 2018-02-21 18:35:39 Yeah, everyone wants to celebrate the mystical Native American right up until it’s time to take their land to mine, pipe oil over, or graze some white man’s cattle  and then they become savages.
2744 2018-02-21 18:35:33 How will America and the Zionist get their filthy fingers on that oil. My guess is “we need to stop drugs flowing through the island”.civil war bla bla bla
2745 2018-02-21 18:35:33 Have you read Alta vs Redwater Energy? Oil is gone, Alta gov tagged with 9 billion in cleanup. Have we adequately addressed pollution risk/response/responsibility issue? Are you saying current level of spill risk is acceptable or that we can handle a spill?
2746 2018-02-21 18:35:14 Thank you and I lost my oil pen recently.  its prob in my crib somewhere
2747 2018-02-21 18:35:14 We all think Hux betrayed by his own stormtrooper would be the worst for him when it's actually the betrayal of his loyal droïd Kayfour still has oil tears in his eyes when he kills Hux
2748 2018-02-21 18:35:11 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2749 2018-02-21 18:35:11 Lol that oil popping everywhere 
2750 2018-02-21 18:35:07 A Smoker's logic: “I haven't changed my oil in my car in & it's fine, runs great... No need to change.”
2751 2018-02-21 18:35:06 Much like trump, he was a great snake oil salesman
2752 2018-02-21 18:35:01 oil has always been priced in dollars. It has nothing to do with thatcher. 
the dollar is now within a couple of pence of its pre ref value. oil price has fallen massively over the last few years. IT was way higher when the pound last crashed in 2008 and maplins survived then.
2753 2018-02-21 18:34:36 ده اساسي الحب والالفه ملوش علاقة بالمكان
2754 2018-02-21 18:34:29 Getting my oil changed 
2755 2018-02-21 18:34:12 Wonder if this oil thing real.
2756 2018-02-21 18:34:12 Much like trump he was an expert at selling snake oil
2757 2018-02-21 18:34:01 *about
2758 2018-02-21 18:33:59 The waste from rare earth mineral mining is far more toxic than oil.
2759 2018-02-21 18:33:49 Can't emphasize how important fish oil is in your diet
2760 2018-02-21 18:33:42 So the oil just show up suh ?
2761 2018-02-21 18:33:24 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
2762 2018-02-21 18:33:23 Let's hope that oil benefits the Jamaicans,but I very much doubt it will
2763 2018-02-21 18:33:15 Getting an oil change, what yall on?
2764 2018-02-21 18:32:59 I got soap and spray. I’ve been thinking about buying emu oil but I haven’t looked into it yet
2765 2018-02-21 18:32:51 If there is a way to completely squander oil wealth Jamaica would find it
2766 2018-02-21 18:32:49 Sanders has always been the left's version of trump. A snake oil salesman driven by his own ego.
2767 2018-02-21 18:32:42 No...Not by all. He was a terrible person and a snake oil salesman.
2768 2018-02-21 18:32:39 i'm just laughing about the 'what are marijuana tablets??' line in #meangirls bc like.. now.. you can get.. marijuana CAPSULES.. with the oil or tincture.. so.. i mean.
2769 2018-02-21 18:32:31 Ooh yes love coconut oil too. Anything natural gets the yes from me
2770 2018-02-21 18:32:29 I'd freak if it cocked one leg in the air and peed hydraulic oil and also noticed that the operator had gone home
2771 2018-02-21 18:32:29 Waiting for Aunty Diana McCauley to join the oil discussion
2772 2018-02-21 18:32:17 think the mineral oil in my shu uemura cleansing oil is clogging up my pores ugh
2773 2018-02-21 18:32:13 I swear niggas slick just like Olive Oil 
2774 2018-02-21 18:32:11 Maroon not on practice ice with oil.
2775 2018-02-21 18:32:00 It almost seems like the graffiti vs oil on canvas debate. Its all art, or none of it is. Being selective in what is or isnt prevents progression for the medium
2776 2018-02-21 18:31:59 Put a crude crushing plant in the middle then built a community near the plant. Oil Palm is not so difficult to maintain. Suited to our Juan Tamad attitude. And they can also intercrop with coffee.
2777 2018-02-21 18:31:58 Lol... Dorcas’ relevance has dried up, she had to pour extra oil on it forgetting we have bigger problems than her bs.
2778 2018-02-21 18:31:54 Fast facts from @Petrotrinnews: the company produces 43,000 barrels of crude oil, and 130 standard cubic feet of gas per day, with 140m barrels of oil equivalent in proven reserves. Petrotrin has a refining capacity of 175,000 bopd, and produces 124,000 bopd, or 71% throughput
2779 2018-02-21 18:31:18 They found oil in Jamaica now suddenly everybody is a geologist, and environmental conservation expert.
2780 2018-02-21 18:31:18 The aticle said we a get 50,000 barrel a oil enu... tht can done
2781 2018-02-21 18:31:07 If people only knew; Farmers plant corn on their land using diesel and oil! Farmers irrigate the land using diesel or natural gas! Farmers harvest their crop using diesel or gasoline! Farmers transport the corn using diesel or gasoline! All, to produce Methanol, instead of food!
2782 2018-02-21 18:31:00 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @Elite365R
2783 2018-02-21 18:30:55 Yet Alberta oil is at a loss of 18 billion while others profit.   This is about money and market share not environment.
2784 2018-02-21 18:30:48 Oh yea man. Almond oil for me cuz coconut oil had my skin looking like a nestle crunch bar and i was OVER it. Lol
2785 2018-02-21 18:30:34 the problem with that theory is the pound now is within a few pence of its pre ref dollar value. 
also the Scottish oil is also UK oil as they are part of UK.
the chance of independence is slipping away faster than the SNP's votes
2786 2018-02-21 18:30:32 Mine are damn near all the way healed so I probably won't need it but damn. The piercing place gave me a whole ass healing kit with the cleaner, emu oil, and sea salt
2787 2018-02-21 18:30:25 Sitting at the dealership. One and a half hour for a oil change... 
2788 2018-02-21 18:30:21 Got car8
2789 2018-02-21 18:30:13 so why does the US consume so much oil from Nigeria?
2790 2018-02-21 18:30:12 Does it have anything to do with your push for "cheap" oil and gas (in this age of global warming) over renewable clean energy? No one believes your BS, Paul.
2791 2018-02-21 18:30:04 Jamaica has just become an oil producing Country. Wow! 
2792 2018-02-21 18:29:59 I say y’all settle this with good old fashioned oil wrestling. 

I’ll be the referee.
2793 2018-02-21 18:29:50 Hello @oil_shaeikh, kindly check your DM for more details. AO
Live. More.
2794 2018-02-21 18:29:49 Just got three clients getting my oil changed for tomorrow and next week  thank you LORD
2795 2018-02-21 18:29:48 How much oil does Nigeria give the US again ... and how affordable is that oil compared to what they pay everywhere else? 

Seems like a fair TRADE if you ask me.
2796 2018-02-21 18:29:40 I am retired oil n gas man from Texas now in Washington State
2797 2018-02-21 18:29:23 Varun tweeted earlier too margin of animal feed will tke sme time to improve which consist of 50% of their revenue,gst effect had - ve effect on diary,last year qtr contain other income due to sale of investment,Bangladesh animal feed nd palm oil margins are improving, lt story

2799 2018-02-21 18:29:16 Boy do *I* feel stupid: *completely* missed the God-given, Constitutionally-affirmed right to drive.
2800 2018-02-21 18:29:15 When Western countries left #Kurds for oil & interests with #IRGC , what should #KRG do! Stand with those that occupied their land or remain with those that left them? 
The same scenario repeated in #Rojava ...
The solution for #Kurds is just their Unity...
2801 2018-02-21 18:29:09 So chick fil a cooks their shit in peanut oil... I’m allergic to nuts 
2802 2018-02-21 18:29:00 Hope it’s a lot of oil ... couple million barrels well
2803 2018-02-21 18:28:42 I just find it all very convenient for the narritive. Why is this particular panel of students being pushed forward as heros while the ROTC students (who actually did something to help) are either largely ignored or lumped in with the suspect because of an air rifle program?
2804 2018-02-21 18:28:35 Americans invented the social media farm. Big oil has been using it for years to spread climate denial. Hillary's Super-PAC even had one called correct the record to argue with Bernie people online during the primaries.
2805 2018-02-21 18:28:30 Make sure to invest in beard oil
2806 2018-02-21 18:28:14 I'm writjng up a story on #Venezuela #Petro for an oil publication. We're looking for any thoughts or comments regarding it or other #cryptocurrency in the oil industry. DM or email me: newsjunk(at)yahoo(dot)com

2809 2018-02-21 18:27:44 おめあり！
また1つ老いてしまった
2810 2018-02-21 18:27:44 Ugh. I’m getting my oil changed and the waiting room smells like that stuff they sprinkled on vomit when someone threw up in school. So that’s how my day is going.
2811 2018-02-21 18:27:38 Note to self: do not use your finger to apply tea tree oil then rub your eye 
2812 2018-02-21 18:27:29 You think assault rifles are dangerous - have you looked at the oregano oil statistics recently? We need a constitutional amendment!
2813 2018-02-21 18:27:20 doesn’t have a good hold bc castor oil is so thick, it’s kinda moisturizing though
2814 2018-02-21 18:27:17 老いが止まらない
2815 2018-02-21 18:27:17 Can’t wait to be in the sun, drinking a pina colada only thinking about when to next apply the oil
2816 2018-02-21 18:27:15 Mama got a tattoo, Myra had a kick ass bday, son son got new clothes, my car gets detailed today and oil change tomorrow. Feeling pretty legit.
2817 2018-02-21 18:27:13 Yea, bt when I put lemon juice on my hand they peel off loads of skin, itch and are sore. Even lemon oil for dusting is a challenge for me.
2818 2018-02-21 18:27:08 When ur dad tells you to give him a ride and he ends up taking you to get a oil change and car wash 
2819 2018-02-21 18:27:00 Ok so i youtube-d home remedies to grow thicker brows... lotsa videos said Coconut oil helps. So now im gonna go to sleep with coconut oil on my right brow so tmr imma be expecting half of my face looking like unshaved pubes idfc
2820 2018-02-21 18:26:55 Feel like the butter ain’t gonna help the bod. Better off using olive oil
2821 2018-02-21 18:26:53 Please give it another try for a week by mixing it's foam with 1/2 drops of carrier oils such as Tea Tree/Vitamin E Oil & Cleanse for a maximum of 10 seconds then rinse.
2822 2018-02-21 18:26:52 Leave in coconut oil conditioner making me feel tropical
2823 2018-02-21 18:26:47 What a day! Oil change, cleaned my car, went to the gym, went grocery shopping. This is living the dream. Now to read outside the rest of the afternoon. 
2824 2018-02-21 18:26:31 Almond oil...
2825 2018-02-21 18:26:29 Yes. And shitloads of oil.
2826 2018-02-21 18:26:23 Use a cleansing oil then a foam cleanser. Depends on what skin type you have thooo, I'm combination/oily so foam cleansers work really well but if you're more dry use a cleansing milk 
2827 2018-02-21 18:26:15 So as a trade off, would shutting down the oil sands mean we meet our climate goal?  If that is the case, it seems like a win win to me.  The oil companies reduce their expenses and liabilities. The cost of clean up is only going to increase.  1/2
2828 2018-02-21 18:26:09 me: just finished exam. having a relaxed drive to chili's

my car: FUEL LEVEL LOW
OIL CHANGE REQUIRED
TIRE MONITOR FAULT

me: having a stressful drive to chili's
2829 2018-02-21 18:26:08 Especially if they make it themselves! #wind #solar from nuclear, with oil to last 5 times longer at a higher return!
2830 2018-02-21 18:26:04 my skin is so soft and glowy ESPECIALLY when i use almond oil, but I've also been doing aloe vera masks every other night
2831 2018-02-21 18:25:49 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.
2832 2018-02-21 18:25:43 Oil is causing environmental problems including climate change that is and will cost us a fortune. There is no positive long term economic value of expanding the oil sands.
2833 2018-02-21 18:25:41 Don’t forget to supplement MCT oil if you are eating #keto you’ll be glad you did!
2834 2018-02-21 18:25:39 MYS' rural poverty is low because of Oil Palm. Here we teach farmer how to plant and harvest but we don't guide where to sell. They end up being fooled by traders. In MYSthey developed Oil Palm by the thousands of hectare and when its bearing they distribute to the farmer.
2835 2018-02-21 18:25:31 Snake oil never really goes away, it just subsides for a bit and comes back under a new name
2836 2018-02-21 18:25:29 Wow this has gotten big.  If I can sneak my way down there could you place me on a team
2837 2018-02-21 18:25:20 Haulted pending news. Oil production results and a new aquision are to be rumoured. We will see !! $eby
2838 2018-02-21 18:25:20 Actually higher oil has been worse for a lot of these equities......higher oil = more future growth = lower prices in future = lower valuation for reserve tail it seems.
2839 2018-02-21 18:25:20 Moderate sunnis mildly ISIS-minded? And the oil every party wants.

2841 2018-02-21 18:25:07 I will be the first to admit I am not and was never an expert in Jamaica's Geological history, but I am curious to know what in that Geological history and Geographical location that would make Jamaica viable for commercial crude oil production? rsp
2842 2018-02-21 18:24:50 [Pats tummy in a happy fashion]   Synthetic for me all the way.....    If synthetic oil works in cars, synthetic blood will work for me...
2843 2018-02-21 18:24:47 Aku pake wardah, dulu utk bagian muka yg kering sampe gatel gitu jadi mendingan. Btw olive oil itu ada yg utk kosmetik ada yg utk makanan
2844 2018-02-21 18:24:43 He is not as popular as you may think. He's a snake oil salesman.

His projects repeatedly fail and cause social damage & he's involved in one of the biggest scams London has seen for years, which we only just managed to stop.
2845 2018-02-21 18:24:29 Try Gaviscon. Take 2-4. Works WONDERS. If you can’t take that while, go get yourself some DiGize essential oil from Young Living and rub it on your belly.
2846 2018-02-21 18:24:20 Man I hate oil change time lol I be needing that lil money shoot
2847 2018-02-21 18:24:04 Smile for Mother! So, what flavor oil do you use?
2848 2018-02-21 18:23:59 كل واحد بيجي ع حسب مصلحته
2849 2018-02-21 18:23:52 That is completely untrue, there is no other industry in this country that goes through as detailed a regulatory process as the oil industry, and all of their claims are fact checked over and over including employment and spin off economic activity.
2850 2018-02-21 18:23:46 @korndiddy go get some peppermint essential oil. The mice and bugs hate the smell. But some drops on various cotton balls and Kleenex and place the around your house.
2851 2018-02-21 18:23:32 Yes. The water make it a little dry when I washed it off so try coconut or someone just recommended almond oil.
2852 2018-02-21 18:23:31 If you thought regular Jamaicans were bad, these Oil Rich Billionaire Jamaicans finna kill you
2853 2018-02-21 18:23:28 Seeing rumblings in the TL that the oil finds might be true... keeping my ear to the ground
2854 2018-02-21 18:23:17 I've been saying this for years-so glad you lent your voice to this cause! The issue is most people don't realize that palm oil is in a lot of products and there needs to be a major awareness campaign...
2855 2018-02-21 18:23:17 Coconut oil that vagina inside and out to keep away yeast and bacteria ladies  thank me later bitches 
2856 2018-02-21 18:23:14 Akwende huko! He came to Baringo because of Oil and Oil only!
2857 2018-02-21 18:23:12 I'm loving essential oils on my face.
Period acne had me in pain and juniperberry oil saved the day.
2858 2018-02-21 18:23:12 many of us cannot follow back
2859 2018-02-21 18:23:10 AKA OIL
2860 2018-02-21 18:23:09 This was not the oil I tweeted about last night. Wowzers, Jamaica
2861 2018-02-21 18:23:08 Wishing the Captain all the squirrel oil and muskrat love it takes to keep him well.
2862 2018-02-21 18:23:07 That is absolutely not true. Patrick is one of the most well respected analysts in the oil industry who ran the Kurdistan Bureau for Iraq Oil Reports for years.
Also, how the hell am I a misogynist now?
2863 2018-02-21 18:22:48 Snake oil salasman just like you
2864 2018-02-21 18:22:43 What do you plan to do about this carbon tax? A lot of the revenue is going to the oil industry to become innovative which is necessary to cut costs in that industry. If you remove the C tax how will the industry prosper since it doesn't innovate by itself? @RachelNotley #Abpoli
2865 2018-02-21 18:22:38 Hit me up for all your oil cartridge needs I’ll take care of you
2866 2018-02-21 18:22:38 Snake oil salesman and false prophet.  It is easier for a camel to pass thru the eye of needle than rich man to enter heaven.
2867 2018-02-21 18:22:24 We will never run out of oil.

2873 2018-02-21 18:21:53 Titan: the life of John Rockefeller. Goes into uncanny detail of his journey. Biggest takeaway: oil was to 18 century investors as crypto is to 2018 investors.
2874 2018-02-21 18:21:46 will I ever be able to get my oil changed without old creepy men hitting on me? lmk
2875 2018-02-21 18:21:44 My dad lives up there & is the service manager at a Ford dealership so it’s more to go see my dad & get the oil change while I’m up there lol 
2876 2018-02-21 18:21:43 Dont want no government controlling any oil we may have. Our brand of politics can be toxic, imagine folks fighting over the spoils to be had there. I trust the corporate overlords. Lemme buy my shares
2877 2018-02-21 18:21:36 Moving oil and gas by pipeline was 4.5 times safer than moving the same volume the same distance by rail in the decade ended in 2013 in Canada, according to a new study by the Fraser Institute public policy think-tank.
2878 2018-02-21 18:21:32 Weed legislation should be an easy layup for the J’can gov’t & all now…

2881 2018-02-21 18:21:13 Unhealthy option - blanch in 150 C oil until chips are cooked, let them cool on a tray with kitchen towel to soak up the excess oil. Once they’re cool, fry them at 190 C for 30 seconds to a minute and they will come out crispy af. Best done with a deep fryer though..
2882 2018-02-21 18:21:10 Today my hands have been mostly covered in bike oil, despite being washed more times than Lady Macbeth’s.

2890 2018-02-21 18:20:46 When i visit a family member my mum hates:

Kirsty read Psalm 23 and Isaiah 58; drink water while u do it, the anointing oil i gave u put it on your head. Do not eat or drink anything in the house, also tell them i said hi

2893 2018-02-21 18:20:29 Mr. President, I agree with you on most issues and positions, but Billy Graham in my estimation was a snake oil salesman who became very rich off the money he conned out of devout Americans. I do not mourn his death.
2894 2018-02-21 18:20:23 I ate a bag of crisps for breakfast. Hey, they had "herbs" and olive oil, okay?

Guns, porn, alcohol, smoking, medications, food, cars, oil, and cows are dangerous for public health.

2900 2018-02-21 18:20:03 I gave her a fire staff to just 'carry' she decided to whip it out whilst we were up to our knees in flammable oil lost 2 hours that time #LydiaWHYLydiaWHY!

2908 2018-02-21 18:19:11 China own Jamaica now anyway.. So a China oil.
2909 2018-02-21 18:19:07 Addressing all the issues mentioned in that second paragraph is just like growing hair in bald head using some fake hair oil... I pity those people who believe in all these marketing words.
2910 2018-02-21 18:19:04 In West Africa? I can only think of Ghana. Nigeria would've been great if we were more focused on tourism instead of focusing all the attention on oil.
2911 2018-02-21 18:19:01 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2912 2018-02-21 18:18:54 But he was a really nice snake oil salesman that advised presidents and deceived people in a nice way! But but but but.
2913 2018-02-21 18:18:53 In any case, I agree with y'all that politicians -whether Harper or Trudeau spend a ton of cash travelling for poor returns. I'd like to see more accountability for the world visits. Not to mention the billions spent on subsidizing the oil industry while liabilities are ours.
2914 2018-02-21 18:18:49 So many charlatans! So much snake oil! Eeee gads!
2915 2018-02-21 18:18:43 And the expert didn't find squat. It took fishermen to lead them to where oil is more likely to be. So what exactly he gave up 50% for. These politicians need to be put in prison for these stupid decision. Would be surprised if he was paid money on the side.
2916 2018-02-21 18:18:24 I would prefer to see a Stanley Cup parade

2923 2018-02-21 18:17:50 Leaving aside your bad maths, what point are you trying get to make?

Every drop of oil, every lump of coal is a fossil.

And do you think we have dug up every rock fossil that exists? Or ever will?
2924 2018-02-21 18:17:46 @thebeardclub What's the best beard oil to get? Mine seems dry and I have to comb it so it doesn't knot up!!
2925 2018-02-21 18:17:37 Healthy option - blanch/steam chips first until they’re just cooked, cool them down, then gently toss them in some oil, salt, pepper, whatever other seasonings you want, then bake at 180-200 C and they should come out crispy every time (1/2)
2926 2018-02-21 18:17:34 Plus our foreign policy has been an disaster since Bush. Russia is going to take advantage of that and get more middle eastern oil as a result.

I dunno, I'm having a weird day, sorry.

2933 2018-02-21 18:16:52 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
2934 2018-02-21 18:16:51 The CT unit or whole plant? Oil is gone down Jim. Besides We are getting coal fired juice from NS to replace it. That green renewable for you. Will we be shutting down HTG now that the link is up?

2950 2018-02-21 18:15:05 Makes me laugh when boys try and look all sexy cooking with no top.. like bitch do you wanna get burnt by hot oil? 
2951 2018-02-21 18:15:02 If robots could sneeze, would it be oil instead of snot? Why would we sneeze? To expel hot air? To get rid of dust in our cooling systems? To be more human like? What uf we had no control over it and we sneeze at a horrible time? What if its a luxury to some bots?
2952 2018-02-21 18:14:50 If there is indeed enough oil here for extraction I hope we use it wisely and finally get some where with marijuana. Our politicians spend too much time bickering and trying to score points on podiums or twitter
2953 2018-02-21 18:14:43 I need more infor in the oil situation. We aguh rich?
2954 2018-02-21 18:14:36 Let's pray that Jamaica handle the oil situation better than they did the bauxite and aluminium situation

2963 2018-02-21 18:13:45 Question was it the said Tullow Oil plc Who was conducting the quest for oil?  Now that we have found oil, can we actually get more info into the deal that was made?
2964 2018-02-21 18:13:41 Great idea!
2965 2018-02-21 18:13:38 I would like to be in Houston Karting, as much to meet you and see that smile in person  as to race you!

2967 2018-02-21 18:13:22 Check out: Rula Darwazeh @RulaTaWa #author of The Power of Connection at #Amazon. Visual artist oil and acrylic painting.rn
2968 2018-02-21 18:13:17 Ever since I started oil painting, I’ve grown quite the collection of cute & tiny jars. I have no idea what those tiny jars will be used for... but I’ve got them.
2969 2018-02-21 18:13:17 Billy Graham was a racist, segregationist snake oil salesman. Figures you liked him.
2970 2018-02-21 18:13:13 can’t have grains, carbs or sugar, but that oil 
2971 2018-02-21 18:13:13 At that altitude of corruption with zero accountability that means, Nigerian economy is going no where slowly. What will happen after the world has disposed of oil?
2972 2018-02-21 18:13:04 I have been using olive oil mixing water with a little soap and it works real good for killing insects in my garden. Not sure how the olive oil would do on an apple tree what should work also.
2973 2018-02-21 18:13:02 A friend of my cousins worked in Libya and he said it was the best place he had ever worked. Free health care, and they subsidized housing, purchase of a car and many other things with their oil revenue. I have no use for this worthless country anymore.
2974 2018-02-21 18:12:44 Only recently I learned that you’re not supposed to oil your scalp.
2975 2018-02-21 18:12:42 You get the oil I’ll do that shit for you, it’s so damn simple.
2976 2018-02-21 18:12:34 When dis oil ting come from a real credible source, i'll believe.
2977 2018-02-21 18:12:32 @OfficialMOPAR a $50 coupon for a synthetic oil change is not a deal. Besides I have a new car.
2978 2018-02-21 18:12:28 Victims of shooting family members should sue the NRA  just at big pharma is sued for opiods and tobacco is sued for cancer and oil is sued for pollution...same principles get em where it hurts...#neveragain

2980 2018-02-21 18:12:25 fucking hell drink some water already. putting a drop of tea tree oil in your moisture isn’t gonna save your blemishes every time.
2981 2018-02-21 18:12:04 Hahahahaha! Thanks, mehn.
2982 2018-02-21 18:11:59 Das Play Calling war furchtbar... ich war dem schlechtesten Play Calling ever im Lucas Oil Stadium... ich dachte, ich seh nicht recht... was denkst du, für wen sie sich im Draft entscheiden werden, oder wenn würdest du bevorzugen?
2983 2018-02-21 18:11:54 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
2984 2018-02-21 18:11:47 20 calories under my goal for the day which roughly equates to two Omega 3 capsules. ABOUT TO GO TITS ON THE FISH OIL, LADS.
2985 2018-02-21 18:11:45 I don’t think I understand lip scrubs. I saw that one where he added the grapefruit essential oil. They sound painful to me lol.
2986 2018-02-21 18:11:42 Second look I looked closely and saw you cut back a few branches. Time for hort oil app.
2987 2018-02-21 18:11:41 Yes, a snake oil salesman conned good people on both sides. He deserves no honor. He assisted in creating our current American demise we call Trump.
2988 2018-02-21 18:11:38 And yet we retreat back to the days where oil and gas were cutting edge technology. When civil rights were dependent on your color. We are better than this.
2989 2018-02-21 18:11:20 we literally just left i’m at the family dollar on the back roads  had to get an oil change
2990 2018-02-21 18:11:15 Discovering a swampy field, I feel my teeth falling out and watch an oil rig twist in my own mouth
2991 2018-02-21 18:11:09 I’m at the garage getting an oil change and some other stuff. Let’s fight about something. @ me.
2992 2018-02-21 18:11:03 this boy beside me in class smells like smoke, ass, & engine oil. I CANT BREATHE!!! 
2993 2018-02-21 18:10:46 I've got baby oil
2994 2018-02-21 18:10:41 only if value investing becomes popular again because $60-$65 oil has done nothing for the equity.
2995 2018-02-21 18:10:33 Got em
2996 2018-02-21 18:10:22 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
2997 2018-02-21 18:10:21 here in the US, we see that we have similar problems as Russia under Putin. A leader and groups who undermine journalism & muddy the waters with propaganda, oil and gas interests who erode democracy with corruption to limit change (Paris accords), oligarchs peddling xenophobia...
2998 2018-02-21 18:10:12 Instead of arming our teachers why don’t we give them raises because they are risking their lives on a daily basis? Why don’t we invest in education rather than oil? Why don’t we choose to care about lives over money?
2999 2018-02-21 18:10:09 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
3000 2018-02-21 18:10:03 The Ancients in Asia used it in their Cornocopiea since 1400BC. Jesus Christ used it in his Holy Annointing Oil it was called Kaneh Bosom, Greek for Cannabis. Pharma in Greek means Evil Magic. This pill blocks that, everyone should be doing a parasite cleanse because of Vaccines.
3001 2018-02-21 18:09:58 My skin is not retaining moisture AT ALL. I need oil/serum recommendations. Not coconut oil!
3002 2018-02-21 18:09:55 People acting like oil reserves of millions of barrels of oil identified in Jamaica. Not yet.
3003 2018-02-21 18:09:52 I am using a growth oil, I’ve used that one in the past but I’m using wild growth now. I like that better but this is a process either way. Lol.
3004 2018-02-21 18:09:50 To how Jamaicans stay...dem soon start bridge the oil
3005 2018-02-21 18:09:49 Lol. Try some olive oil, garlic, and some sea salt and bake them. This is the only way I can eat them.
3006 2018-02-21 18:09:43 Because, of course, oil and gas takes precedence over everything else
3007 2018-02-21 18:09:43 Everyone wants a car till they get a car because of gas, oil changes, and repairs, I’m over it
3008 2018-02-21 18:09:42 I added 17 drops of eucalyptus oil to my diffuser and then I read the instructions and it says “add 2-4 drops”
3009 2018-02-21 18:09:38 Except a spike in oil prices.
3010 2018-02-21 18:09:26 So she would make our huge oil deposits a safe space from us Americans then the Saudi’s could make more money off American hard workers. Thank God Trump won and we got a tax cut and the ability to drill our own oil to cut down costs.
3011 2018-02-21 18:09:19 Virgin, not heated up or whatever (aka proper) coconut oil. Lasts forever! No chemicals!
3012 2018-02-21 18:09:16 The smell of sesame oil 
3013 2018-02-21 18:08:44 You where about 20 miles from me. We use to go get weed in Canada & honey oil hash. Take acid over.
3014 2018-02-21 18:08:24 The explanation we got was that the oil was dumped down a storm drain, and took several routes down to the Lea.
So they started containing way upstream, but it also  came through outlets further downstream a day later.
3015 2018-02-21 18:08:21 Bringing in your eighteen year old car for an oil change is kinda like taking your eighteen year old dog for a walk #justkeepwalking
3016 2018-02-21 18:08:19 I have a cousin who just graduated from UT with a degree in film. She went from reasonably middle of the road to a Resist-type raging fem. So sad.
3017 2018-02-21 18:07:56 Just keep checking your oil regularly. If it looks like it was just changed then don’t worry about it. If it looks real black and resembles sludge, then you need to change it. With most vehicles today, if your not over driving it then you can go 4 to 6 months between changes.
3018 2018-02-21 18:07:55 Wow Joan Haanappel heeft goeie genen of is in een bad met Oil of Olaz gevallen #dwdd
3019 2018-02-21 18:07:49 “I wake every morning next to a black scarf and coconut oil, I’m married to a black queen”
3020 2018-02-21 18:07:33 So what about all the barges of fuel traveling to the island????? How many barges sank or ran abound last year compared to 60 years of oil tankers hauling bitumen???
3021 2018-02-21 18:07:30 You're assuming that an independent scotland would continue to operate under a UK framework. It won't.  Until all scottish finances are in scottish hands and the power to nationalise vital resources such as oil are ours , we won't know the exact figure.
3022 2018-02-21 18:07:24 New oil change who this
3023 2018-02-21 18:07:18 I have vicks, and some amazing essential oil and throat drops that my financial advisor of all people gave me!! Went to bed with oil & vicks on my feet last night and slept like a log!!
3024 2018-02-21 18:07:18 Guyana and Jamaica are only gonna see scraps from that oil money
3025 2018-02-21 18:07:07 SGR & other infrastructures are built for a purpose when Turkana start export of Oil SGR will be necessary but at the moment the need is not there
3026 2018-02-21 18:06:58 It has always struck me as strange talking about oil production in general without mentioning APIs/oil quality. I wonder what US oil production is like if one 'discounts' for its very high API and global refineries limited capacity to process it. Oil producer vs. exporter...
3027 2018-02-21 18:06:53 Bustamante goodly sell out the oil already and we nuh kno
3028 2018-02-21 18:06:50 Very good question! I believe weapons manufacturers own most of our country. Selling fear keeps them in business. The same small group owns oil, pharmaceutical and major Corp. They covet our tax money and the last thing they want is for us to vote on anything
3029 2018-02-21 18:06:46 Actually come to think of it, all those nations operated very advanced industries during the time their access to easy oil was cut off. The same is true of the US during the oil shock period.
3030 2018-02-21 18:06:44 Smithville oil wells? Lol
3031 2018-02-21 18:06:38 This is the only news worth hearing about "Billy Graham".

3032 2018-02-21 18:06:25 He was just a snake oil selling charlatan like all the rest of his kind.
3033 2018-02-21 18:06:20 Same here in Louisiana, isn't self defense grand?

3037 2018-02-21 18:06:10 The price of oil and inflation are often seen as being connected in a cause and effect relationship. As oil prices move up or down, inflation follows in the same direction.

3041 2018-02-21 18:05:51 Waiting to get my oil change and I left my fucking book in the car  I stared at as I got out of the car and thought why would I bring it in w me. Fucking idiot
3042 2018-02-21 18:05:29 I worked out, my face is covered in coconut oil, and it's warm out... TODAY IS GONNA SUCK THIS DICK!
3043 2018-02-21 18:05:24 My fingers felt the oil on each patterned thumb. Rough tiny patterns printed into shapes. Endless miniatures rushed round taut skin. The dry meat under my thumb was living leather. Dried by salt, sand, and sunlight. Calloused by rope, rung, and sail.

3046 2018-02-21 18:05:07 Found a g of oil while cleaning my room:))))) happy day
3047 2018-02-21 18:05:04 Thanks for the report. What a boring oil day today.

3049 2018-02-21 18:04:45 That deficit has everything to do with an extraordinarily inflated military budget that’s used in the interests of oil and weapons contractors. And the current administration increased it even further from already record levels.
3050 2018-02-21 18:04:43 قول مشاءالله العين حق
3051 2018-02-21 18:04:41 1) dilbit is NOT oil and it's the INCREASE in risky tanker traffic we object to 2) we are right to be concerned about emissions, what's shocking is that you AREN'T 3)  coal is NOT the same threat to BC as dilbit, a coal spill won't destroy our coast ... the article is nonsense
3052 2018-02-21 18:04:12 That oil probably already belongs to some external interest 
3053 2018-02-21 18:04:11 But that might give them PTSD or something, especially if they have to handle an icky AR...

3061 2018-02-21 18:02:53 So I came to get my oil changed and apparently there’s been a little family of MICE LIVING IN MY AIR FILTER SYSTEM! A mouse literally just ran up the mechanics arm. MY LIFE IS A SITCOM.

Klar kann man annehmen, dass ein solches Ereignis unvermeidbar ist (wie peak oil). Aber es zu forcieren (die Ölimporte aussetzen), ist ein radikaler Schritt, der imho nicht die Zustimmung der Community hatte.
Sorry für das sicher schiefe Bild.

Argon Oil mixed with Coconut Oil works really well after applying Castor Oil. It covers the raw scent the Castor oil leaves as well.

Conditioning your beard and applying leave in conditioner prior to all the above is good too

3077 2018-02-21 18:01:50 Even Saudi Arabia is moving towards solar energy. Everyone knows things have to change & fast. But world is still 'addicted' to oil & gas because so much energy is being used. Oil & gas remain the most dense form of energy which does not require separate storage technology.
3078 2018-02-21 18:01:48 Someone should come to ellensburg with me to get my oil changed

3093 2018-02-21 18:00:18 Don't lesser your fab product. Good olive oil and chilli oil is more than suffice. You have both.
3094 2018-02-21 18:00:16 Just look wa go happen now that we struck oil .... watch how dem ago sell more than we done sold out now.... WE ARE WATCHING  This administration even more closely than ever b4.

3097 2018-02-21 18:00:03 Love to share! Located in N. Ontario. We make artisanal pasta for home or hot, along with importing small batch flavour infused olive oil and balsamic. @pasta_shoppe @SupOliveOil #smallbusinessowner

3103 2018-02-21 17:59:27 I made it through both of those movies, but I never did finish OIL! 
3104 2018-02-21 17:59:23 Apple could be buying cobalt from mining companies directly  Cobalt is the new oil. Car companies and battery manufacturers are all rushing to secure multiyear contracts with mining companies for their lithium-ion batteries. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is also par…
3105 2018-02-21 17:59:08 No way an Iron lady, she is an oily dipstick - iron you can melt but crude oil is sliding you off in all crazy directions in the name of #greed #oilgreed #Alberta #bcpoli #cdnpoli #OilOFF this is insanity
3106 2018-02-21 17:59:04 Expand your thinking. Total GHG emissions because of this product. Does the closing of a coal plant in China lower emissions by using Canadian Oil?
3107 2018-02-21 17:58:59 Drinking rosehip tea and smoking weed, while liberally applying rosehip oil to my skin 
3108 2018-02-21 17:58:58 Careful - telling lies against a player from an oil rich team isn’t a good idea! There are lawyers on every corner! Just chill and fill your car up - every little helps towards our next signing!
3109 2018-02-21 17:58:32 Uh, no. F*ck you. 
Oil spills are inevitable. The damage to the coastline will cost more in lost revenue than your $$$ from oil rigs.
Shame on you!
3110 2018-02-21 17:58:28 Today's weather: sunny and mid 70s. It is way too nice out to sit in an office and work. So today is car day. Getting it cleaned out, washed, oil changed and tires checked.
Tomorrow's weather: 35 and snow 
3111 2018-02-21 17:58:21 Wow, oil in Jamaica
3112 2018-02-21 17:58:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
3113 2018-02-21 17:58:02 In 1976, a book entitled THE PROPHECY NOTEBOOK, looked at Oklahoma and said this would be seen when USA ran out of liquid oil and was fracking.
It gets WORSE.
3114 2018-02-21 17:58:00 Rosewater applied w/ a damp beauty blender 
Argan oil
3115 2018-02-21 17:57:46 Oil in Jamaica?
3116 2018-02-21 17:57:37 Tell the Chinese to keep their oil..
3117 2018-02-21 17:57:35 Rather counter-intuitively, spray oil. Reacts with the rubber and makes it sticky. Not too much tho.
3118 2018-02-21 17:57:30 Jamaica find oil... island wars nuh good again.
3119 2018-02-21 17:57:19 社内ｱﾆﾒｰﾀｰに聞いた方がスケジュール把握しやすいって……制作は管理職って分かってるのかな
3120 2018-02-21 17:56:56 Dr. Deb...so who benefits from sales made in EBT transactions?  I'm not against forcing people on assistance into eating healthier, but let's not pretend EBT fraud is a bogeyman the size of say...corporate welfare that supports the oil industry. #perspective
3121 2018-02-21 17:56:55 Tell you what is really fucking annoying is when I'm out for food and can't have chips cos they've used the oil for meat products. Fuming
3122 2018-02-21 17:56:54 I know I'm going to regret writing this immediately, but this is the most boring #oil price trading range of any #IPWeek ever -- #OOTT #IPWeek2018
3123 2018-02-21 17:56:53 Thanks Geanine, just used the app and I lost 1500.

3125 2018-02-21 17:56:49 Has Aquero been arrested yet and charged with assault...nope....Oil money talks, Justice walks.

Come see us ! Santa Fe Olive Oil and Balsamic Co !
3127 2018-02-21 17:56:18 Hovercraft effect of oil? Never seen that one before.
3128 2018-02-21 17:56:13 Oil inna Jamaica? A mussi me back them a look pon.
3129 2018-02-21 17:56:09 Trying to see how Jamaica having oil is gonna do any good and Jah know
3130 2018-02-21 17:56:02 Everyday that oil and gas is used does damage! We have known that for a long time. Question is how fast can we replace it (in the face of resistance)? Luckily resistance is quickly declining. Coal use will be done within 10-15 years.
3131 2018-02-21 17:56:01 Jamaicans not too excited about oil.. Can you wrong us?
3132 2018-02-21 17:55:55 #ukog KL5 is flowing and was still cleaning up with increasing oil cut. The bopd maybe a lot higher on expected news soon.
3133 2018-02-21 17:55:49 Wow I’ve spent the entire day thinking about what I’m gonna do with all my oil money
3134 2018-02-21 17:55:42 ダメ制作が何も言ってこない、つか居ない……締切明日まで使っていいならもう一カット終わったら帰るけど、ダメなら昼まで仕事コース、状況の確認くらい聞きにきてよ、それに会社にいないんじゃこっちからもできんだろが
3135 2018-02-21 17:55:41 Natural oil found flowing in Jamaica i hear?
3136 2018-02-21 17:55:13 Argan oil
3137 2018-02-21 17:55:11 *FECOF*-  some say Reed Bank has gas/oil reserves in the region of 10 -15 TRILLION $ ,we have 6.8% so pick a number.. add a couple of zeros
3138 2018-02-21 17:55:09 If you do a variance decomposition of TWI Dollar moves into rate diff, oil and some controls for risk appetite, you model 70 percent of the variation in changes with the rate diff the most important driver by far. So that is my first point.
3139 2018-02-21 17:54:48 Idk if it was the 4 shots of Jim Bean back to back or the oil from the Pool party last year but I died. Kris’s birthday I had 4 shots of apple crown on an empty stomach and died again. I know freshman year Maliyah would be disappointed in my alcohol tolerance rn
3140 2018-02-21 17:54:38 2nd safest way to transport oil would be by rail. Pipeline 1st. 
Oil isn't going anywhere soon. This is confusing
3141 2018-02-21 17:54:06 @permahemp Looking to connect with Gary Hilliard for oil extraction solvents (hexane, ethanol, IPA, etc). Referred by distillation company out of Ohio. I'm in GA and ship to Cannabis/hemp all over country (not yet to Kentucky). 800 886-8240 info@ecolink.com
3142 2018-02-21 17:54:04 Where have you been in 1982, 1983, 1996 and 2006 when regime change project was planned? By the rich donors. For Syrian oil, gas, water, land, Golan, regional power.
3143 2018-02-21 17:53:59 So they found 2 teaspoons of oil in Jamaica. lol
3144 2018-02-21 17:53:57 Shoutout to whoever RT’d that coconut oil, honey & brow sugar face scrub... my shit is GLOWING 
3145 2018-02-21 17:53:55 He graduated from reactionary snake oil to literal snake oil. #karma
3146 2018-02-21 17:53:48 @theJeremyVine what a WANKER talks about cannabis oil helping relieve pain in illnesses.
Then plays UB40 
When will the BBC sack the arshole 
Sorry if that's an insult to arsholes
3147 2018-02-21 17:53:44 what's the best hair mask/shampoo/conditioner/oil for a damaged dry hair? help ya girl out
3148 2018-02-21 17:53:44 Watermelon with feta, olive oil, sprinkled with some dukkah. So easy and so delicious. #travelchatsa
3149 2018-02-21 17:53:39 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3150 2018-02-21 17:53:39 Usually I bread them and lightly fry them.

I dunno, lime juice, oil, vinegar, chipotles, mole, garlic. These are options
3151 2018-02-21 17:53:37 Me a watch ever news outlet tonight in this country,to see report of that so called "oil" onshore narrative.
3152 2018-02-21 17:53:31 Far fetched? Whoever writes these tweets should be boiled in oil.
3153 2018-02-21 17:53:12 Venezuela has oil too and........
3154 2018-02-21 17:52:54 What the fuck I knew some #Orange juice had gelatin in   hadn't heard of fish oil been put in
3155 2018-02-21 17:52:39 Plus they own their oil fields.
3156 2018-02-21 17:52:26 Remember there was the oil that was also got rid of because it was old?? That also worth a couple of bucks. All these people are being protected because of ANC.... This could have funded students. But no raise vat
3157 2018-02-21 17:52:25 Some things just don't mix, like ranch and hot wings, or oil and water, or you and Kelly...
3158 2018-02-21 17:52:19 So that’s what happened to Trump’s hair! Castor oil is likely to make it fall out.

3160 2018-02-21 17:52:02 勝ち取りたいwwwwwwwモノもないwwwwww無欲な馬鹿にはなれないwwwwww
3161 2018-02-21 17:51:58 I guess it will. Baby oil dissolves all kinds of waxy sticky substances.
3162 2018-02-21 17:51:55 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
3163 2018-02-21 17:51:54 I retweeted so I guess I am bot, or a toaster.
3164 2018-02-21 17:51:43 oil on canvas
3165 2018-02-21 17:51:41 lol...coconut or vegetable oil??
3166 2018-02-21 17:51:37 As weird as it may sound, but I like the smell of Tamanu oil.
3167 2018-02-21 17:51:36 マジで寝よ 課題も考査も知らねえ
おやすみなさい
3168 2018-02-21 17:51:29 No wonder the food science book was the one you started on. I’ve got to lend that to my upstairs neighbour, who was going on about the hovercraft effect of olive oil. (He admitted he’d made up the phrase but swears it’s a thing when he cooks.)
3169 2018-02-21 17:51:18 Wars for oil is MURDER.
3170 2018-02-21 17:51:11 Nigeria is just like Wakanda. Oil as Vibranium, art and culture but with horrible selfish leaders.
Imagine if our leadership had a modicum amount of sense back then, how good things might have turned out.
3171 2018-02-21 17:51:10 JA should have kept the discovery of oil and entire secret and made like Wakanda
3172 2018-02-21 17:51:10 can’t relate
3173 2018-02-21 17:51:08 Neem Oil! @juliecgriffin put me on to it and it works

3176 2018-02-21 17:51:02 I agree a better BC is needed and dirty oil will soon be a thing of the past.  And oh boy, BC makes great wine - had no idea the gr8 selection @LCBO @albertaNDP
3177 2018-02-21 17:50:55 Here are the 15 ingredients Consumer Reports says you should avoid:

Aconite
Caffeine Powder
Chaparral
Coltsfoot
Comfrey
Germander
Greater Celandine
Green Tea Extract Powder
Kava
Lobelia
Methylsynephrine
Pennyroyal Oil
Red Yeast Rice
Usnic Acid
Yohimbe
3178 2018-02-21 17:50:51 Coconut oil is good for a hair mask I believe. It is also an antibacterial and antifungal.
3179 2018-02-21 17:50:48 Y’all still taking whole people including their personalities when all y’all want is a lil action? Niggas need oil changes and ask for a whole other car?
3180 2018-02-21 17:50:44 Adrian is a whind up merchant. That’s his bread and butter 
3181 2018-02-21 17:50:40 Just saw a commercial for lobster truffle oil mac n cheese.  It’s everything you shouldn’t do to mac n cheese, done to mac n cheese.
3182 2018-02-21 17:50:38 I'm standing outside getting my oil changed and I'm sweating like it's August. IT IS FEBRUARY. #notcool #alwx

3185 2018-02-21 17:50:20 Oil has been found in Jamaica? Watch America find a reason to visit
3186 2018-02-21 17:50:18 Already tried coconut and castor doubt baby oil will make a difference
3187 2018-02-21 17:49:59 Yes then British will divide and rule then America continue to suck the oil and Middle east never be stable  this what happened in History. Since Ottomans Middle east never seen stability :)
3188 2018-02-21 17:49:59 Wife- “...A fourth cup of olive oil”
Me- “We need more, we don’t have enough for a quarter cup”
Wife- (agitated) “I said a forth, we don’t need enough for a quarter cup!”
Me- “Okaaaaaayyy!”
3189 2018-02-21 17:49:53 Waiting for the mechanic who will do my oil change finish eating. He kept heckling the students speaking about gun control in Florida on Fox News. He shut up when he saw me staring him down. But now he is dragging his feet so he doesn’t have to work on my car.
3190 2018-02-21 17:49:40 何だろう。ポッと出てこない。魂とかかな……
3191 2018-02-21 17:49:38 I had the same problem. Found that using a cleansing oil before a hydrating cleanser (like Cerave) actually made a huge difference. Seemed contrary - to put oil on my already oily skin - but it worked. Even toned down the daily oiliness.
3192 2018-02-21 17:49:36 Why is school dismissing at 2:30??? I know it's early release for everyone else but what the fuck I have a ride why do I have to stay??
3193 2018-02-21 17:49:18 What is the secret of 11 herbs and spices in KFC chicken ... we know it is fried in a pressure cooker and we know it contain white pepper, glutamate, self raising flour, salt... that is four what are the other seven spices... can you guess or google it.. what oil used?

3195 2018-02-21 17:49:13 How do you increase competition and choice for passengers whilst creating a new monopoly at Heathrow? You have been outwitted by the Heathrow PR machines. The downturn in North Sea oil will see reduced demand for flights from Aberdeen, and this will only continue. @AirportWatch
3196 2018-02-21 17:49:09 Getting the Mini's oil changed 
3197 2018-02-21 17:49:05 how come no matter what I do within a few hours my foundation is all cakey and oily and sliding all over my face  I’ve tried numerous foundations, primers, moisturizers, oil free products, powders all in different orders and nothing works :((
3198 2018-02-21 17:48:51 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
3199 2018-02-21 17:48:49 Tell Alberta we don't want crude oil running through our province.  Alberta gets most of the benefit while BC takes all the risk. What cost?  If and when there is a disaster, the planet will pay for greed.
3200 2018-02-21 17:48:48 Either red or golden ones. I just steam them in the microwave and I've been having them with chicken, asparagus and just a little olive oil and sooo good
3201 2018-02-21 17:48:47 Oregano oil too
3202 2018-02-21 17:48:42 I mean...he's a snake oil salesman who became a multi millionaire talking about an invisible man in the sky.  Not much to celebrate.  I'm sure he enjoyed his millions $$$...thanks for donating to the cause!
3203 2018-02-21 17:48:33 No they are annoying lol
3204 2018-02-21 17:48:31 Similar to the comments on olive oil (which I would have suggested if it wasn't already on the list!) balsamic vinegar and if you'd use it rice vinegar. Also if you plan on baking good butter can make a huge difference
3205 2018-02-21 17:48:26 All I’ve said is 2 league cup wins before the oil money doesn’t mean much
3206 2018-02-21 17:48:20 Oil changes almost always hit me in my weak spot
3207 2018-02-21 17:48:13 Thank you @TomSteyer -- we already knew there was corruption and criminality in the oil industry but EVERYONE needs to be made aware of the depths these people will go.  Their agenda is one of unbridled greed & ultimately will be their downfall.
3208 2018-02-21 17:47:59 So unimaginative. It's always "take the oil" instead of making the oil valueless.
3209 2018-02-21 17:47:55 Easy on the oil & butter…Add flavour through SPICES & HERBS! 
@chickenfarmers #chickenchat
3210 2018-02-21 17:47:52 Try steaming your face and then using the oil?
3211 2018-02-21 17:47:45 To get Canadian oil off the continent currently, it has to be extracted out of the ground in the Alberta, shipped ~3000 km down through the US by train, and then loaded onto tankers. This significantly increases the price per barrel and makes it not viable to export
3212 2018-02-21 17:47:38 Try baby oil
3213 2018-02-21 17:47:35 Hopefully pollution gets so bad that oil and gas goes through a cycle like water so we can have unlimited gas cause that shits expensive
3214 2018-02-21 17:47:30  I’m actually taking care of this one haha not like my last one w the non existent oil changes 
3215 2018-02-21 17:47:28 coconut oil is the gift that keeps on giving
3216 2018-02-21 17:47:25 Now available at Smithers Feed Store. CBD oil. 
Good for so many things.
Good for humans too.
3217 2018-02-21 17:47:25 We also disagree in that I don’t find much humor in a wrongful death or in defending it/not speaking against it. Not surprised you do. Are we done now?
3218 2018-02-21 17:47:17 It’s an interesting question.  Perhaps like the fossil-powered IR itself, a few significant materials advances.  Polymers, alloys etc.? There is still a lot of oil in renewables.  And a Tesla, for that matter.
3219 2018-02-21 17:47:05 Yes, Russia has destroyed Venezuela in buying their oil fields. Putin has bought US coal mines as well.
3220 2018-02-21 17:46:59 Nice. I've been struggling to get done what I should do this week. Hopefully I'll make it to the oil change place in the next hour
3221 2018-02-21 17:46:58 ok but get one of those shit insurance deals from 12 am tv

3228 2018-02-21 17:46:31 The truth hurts, huh? Politician's income is not to protect or support legal voters but oil companies that give them bigger income/ incentives , we voters are a big joke to them, yet we keep voting for them!!!
3229 2018-02-21 17:46:21 While we are exited about the oil discovery , we must be caustiously optimistic about the severe implications of the oil on our environment and other vices that may arrive
3230 2018-02-21 17:46:13 Aww !! This is so sad and sweet
3231 2018-02-21 17:46:08 mi mummy chaypu ra kodaka good ni8 ani plzz raa puku puchi poenda mi mummy di haa zam oil pampista thisukoraa raa my son
3232 2018-02-21 17:45:55 I just spilled hot olive oil on my hand. Trying to pretend it doesn’t hurt because it’s unmanly to acknowledge pain 
3233 2018-02-21 17:45:46 My question is what if the oil is found on the Goat island or even the cockpit country? Those areas are protected init?

3241 2018-02-21 17:44:57 Juan, the BIGGEST mistake is to ship oil by rail. Co's do not want their profits lost on pipe spills, let alone the enviro impact. They do everything in their power to avoid such tragedies. We lost $117B in the past 7 years selling oil at a discount to our only customer - the US.

3249 2018-02-21 17:44:08 The US has oil processing capacity near the gulf coast so it can easily ship products across the ocean. By contrast, the oil fields in Alberta are cut off by mountains to the west and the Canadian shield to the east. Only one place to go - the central US
3250 2018-02-21 17:44:08 Girls: how do i get eyelash glue out of my lashes, i washed my face 10 times, showered, & tried to get the glue out with oil on a spooly brush. Nothings working. Oh i also slept with castor oil on my lashes.
3251 2018-02-21 17:43:54 I need to go get my oil changed today
3252 2018-02-21 17:43:52 I love how Jamaican Twitter is lit about this oil news ... 

Soon hear Andrew sey "The oil found in Jamaica does not belong to the country because we had made an agreement with (country) stating that if oil was struck, it is theirs in exchange for (something)."
3253 2018-02-21 17:43:41 Dah makin berumur ni nak stay up pun tak boleh lama lama hahahahah man I'm too old for this burning the midnight oil kinda thing...lelz speaking like I'm in my 40's already..... goodbye world
3254 2018-02-21 17:43:39 fine. ill be the one to say it. acrylic is a fuck ugly medium and inferior to oil
3255 2018-02-21 17:43:35 No, they're not, very painful. Husband is Scottish. When we were first dating we went swimming and I put my coconut oil on his back. He burned and blistered like a fried fish!! I decided then I'm lucky not to burn.
3256 2018-02-21 17:43:29 Pro oil/natural gas! @scrowder @NotGayJared
3257 2018-02-21 17:43:20 I would say that I'm thankful that my son is graduating high school this year, but then again, that means he's going to college. I can remember imagining that moment when he was little, and it was NOTHING like the reality that faces us today.

3264 2018-02-21 17:42:45 Fracking and storage pose different problems. How much they drill will depend on demands and oil prices. If prices or demand go down, there will be much less drilling and hopefully a new administration can greatly reduce it further. Not hopeless.
3265 2018-02-21 17:42:41 Can we stop with the Billy Graham already. He was snake oil salesman peddling lies. The world is better off without him. #notmypastor
3266 2018-02-21 17:42:33 But first use Oil of Olé.
3267 2018-02-21 17:42:28 Taliban supports #TAPI as it leads to economic gains for Pakistan ? But what if India  refuses to buy from Pakistan ?  Iran  - Oman  - India  pipeline also an option. Plus oil - gas shipping to Mumbai, India  via Chabahar, Iran ☫  
3268 2018-02-21 17:42:27 Agreed. China has the market, can provide the physical infrastructure. But if the SH oil contract is any indication, might be a way to go on “software.” Your thoughts?

3271 2018-02-21 17:42:10 @jasonmyrt @HARRYMAYES975 @975Middays Now that Kapler's playing music at practice like Chip, does that mean that Chip's applying oil to his entire body like Kapler?
3272 2018-02-21 17:42:06 Yes, Oud is rarely branded it's just pure perfume oil without any alcohol. £10 for 10ml works out at about £100 for £100ml
3273 2018-02-21 17:42:04 cbd oil is not cannabis, even if it does account for up to 40% of the plants extract... uninformed comment is unhelpful.

3276 2018-02-21 17:41:42 You make an excellent point here. The oil industry is inherently unsafe
3277 2018-02-21 17:41:41 The MOP question today is, since I know the multiple uses for coconut oil by watching @boozychef in action, is it best for:

3279 2018-02-21 17:41:26 Guy was a snake oil salesman
3280 2018-02-21 17:41:24 Oh the oil.
Yeah man. First the oil, then the carnival, then we nah go need Dem again
3281 2018-02-21 17:41:22 Trinidad has more oil and natural gas reserve to dwarf the U.S.? The U.S. is on track to surpass Russia and saudi Arabia to become largest exporter of oil in the world.
3282 2018-02-21 17:41:20 We struck oil , yeah!!!.same thing is going to happen like with our bauxite sugar, coffee and now weed we sold it out and no real benefits to the Jamaican ppl.
3283 2018-02-21 17:41:20 Internet. I don't know how do this works, the only thing I read is that the kitchen oil boils at a higher temperature than the one CPUs can get (yes, it was made for CPU, but it worked just great with my old GPU) and for that reason CPU remains cool
3284 2018-02-21 17:41:17 You’re both way more well versed in this than I am. I just want something I can pick up at cvs or something. My skin is good. I don’t wear makeup, I feel like Oil of Olay or Eucerin is right in my wheelhouse.
3285 2018-02-21 17:41:17 I'm only kidding...#Wondering? Instead of building nuclear reactors for Saudi Arabia. Why don't we build them here in the U.S. than cut oil production? Than sign the United Free Trade Agreement...! #freetrade
3286 2018-02-21 17:41:09 Because the majority of your success has happened over the last 10 years since your club was flooded with oil money
3287 2018-02-21 17:41:04 you know a worship service was good when you leave wearing half a teaspoon of bertolli's extra virgin olive oil
3288 2018-02-21 17:40:49 And that’s maybe true. But how much we have them for their capacity? That’s what I want to know... cuz they never out here for 4/5 years searching for oil for free
3289 2018-02-21 17:40:47 The fact that I immediately stopped caring about how huge the oil thing is says a lot about how much I believe in whoever runs our country
3290 2018-02-21 17:40:45 I’m snowed in listening to a good podcast, sipping tea, playing in my fro smelling like nutty oil, butters and lavender.

Please.
3299 2018-02-21 17:39:47 Anyone know of a good oil free acne cleanser?  I'm looking for something a little more organic
3300 2018-02-21 17:39:43 Honestly, as little as possible. A drugstore type brand that I can find easily & doesn’t break the bank. Like a Eucerin or Oil of Olay type thing. I don’t want to fall in love with some crazy pricy new brand that may or may not be around in 6 months.

Guns are American
3303 2018-02-21 17:39:22 Sorry to disturb again. I noticed he used acrylics. Could it be done in oil? When he goes over it numerous times is that with paint or just to scrape? I tried this. It’s not easy
3304 2018-02-21 17:39:21 I hope the Gov tender a proper contract of 50-50 for the oil profits and exclude all Chinese firms. We no need the yellow man colonization

3309 2018-02-21 17:38:49 Dawg I’m so anxious about this oil. I just know the government going find a way to fuck this up
3310 2018-02-21 17:38:49 Saying “we disagree” when you have essentially advocated for illegal activities is hilarious.
3311 2018-02-21 17:38:48 @LeePerryUT as long as air pollution and car and traffic accidents are at a decline, and there are less of those car oil spills, I think it's okay without the cars being inspected, but with less inspection comes less taxes and Federal and State paychecks and stuff. So.

3317 2018-02-21 17:37:25 Met some during my service year. They work with an oil company and they are graduates. They earn from 130k upward with allowances sef and some other end of the year package. Funny enough the job was outsourced but that was the procedure the oil company wanted.
3318 2018-02-21 17:37:07 i made a concoction of skin musk and black pepper/cinnamon/citrus oil and it looks like pee but it smells really good

3347 2018-02-21 17:34:39 Yes, she was a lovely woman who loved people like Jesus loves people. Billy Graham was like Jesus too, genuine, not insincere and not like the snake oil salesmen. He lived very simply, not in prosperity like the televangelists. He was grassroots, non-partisan, so kind.
3348 2018-02-21 17:34:39 You don't have to keep advertising your ignorance. Cutting of access to recoverable oil merely drives up the use of other carbon energy sources. There no lasting emissions shifts. Historically this has been observed in Germany, Japan and Russia.

3388 2018-02-21 17:29:48 Snake oil salesman to a generation.
3389 2018-02-21 17:29:48 I think it should be shut down to BC let them decide if easy or not. They are the ones hurting Canadians in every province across Canada. USA buys our Oil cheap and now reselling it to India. BC needs to be held accountable SHUT them DOWN to BC

3391 2018-02-21 17:29:29 it's NOT revisionism ... AT& T & Big Oil was BROKEN UP ...  now the "Big internet" like $AMZN + #Google + #Facebook MUST ALL BE BROKEN UP under the Sherman Antitrust act
3392 2018-02-21 17:29:25 I do not buy products with palm oil. This issue needs a massive awareness campaign. It's unbelievable how many products contain palm oil.
3393 2018-02-21 17:29:20 Have you tried oil pulling?
3394 2018-02-21 17:29:15 If you would just read the numbers - MMS maintained 6%+ gdp in 2008 global crisis while Modi is struggling with 6% in favorable global scenario and cheap crude oil..
3395 2018-02-21 17:28:48 The White people you hate are not your neighbors or lawyers. They are the Rockafeller’s Rothschild’s Bush’s and Royals. They are the people who monopolize water and oil.
3396 2018-02-21 17:28:47 Getting the oil changed in Aurora IL, then maybe lunch with Wayne and Garth. You youngins might not get that reference but that’s OK
3397 2018-02-21 17:28:44 Right on, Sarah. You go! They say the squeaky wheel gets the oil. Keep squeaking, loud and long, until the NRA and the politicians who feed from their trough have to take their hands off of their ears and reach for the oil can of justice and fix our dangerous and broken gun laws.
3398 2018-02-21 17:28:35 I must have! The worst part is that I bought a $9 bottle of olive oil to replace the $4 bottle so my coat smells like the fancy olive oil I never got to try!
3399 2018-02-21 17:28:30 There are more jobs currently offered in the renewable clean energy sector than in oil (U.S.) industry. Clean energy solutions is our future. Oil is the past.
3400 2018-02-21 17:28:25 Probably not, but this doesn't change the rate of extraction, it just diverts oil from american commodity futures markets to ones in singapore and tokyo?

3410 2018-02-21 17:27:50 Billy Graham was a reactionary snake oil salesman. He helped pervert American Christianity into the rightwing evangelical hate cult it is today. The world is better without him.
3411 2018-02-21 17:27:48 What’s the Akan word for oil ??? Jamaica need a name change like today
3412 2018-02-21 17:27:45 All that oil 
3413 2018-02-21 17:27:32 Turns out there r 3 options. .  mash which is just like regular mash with cream, butter and a little cinnamon and nutmeg . Crispy fries r like regular fries but it means U hv to cut thin and fry them . Oven baked r like wedges - same spices &olive oil but they turn out soft .
3414 2018-02-21 17:27:27 Expect this phenomenon to increase exponentially next 3-5 years! Today’s $26/barrel basis or discount, EVERY BARREL of oil will seek to get on rail! At approx $14/barrel to load a car&ship, leaves oil producers a xtra $12/barrel in revenue on 640 barrel car is $7680 vS PIPELINE
3415 2018-02-21 17:27:23 How we so salt? We find oil just when everybody a buy Tesla
3416 2018-02-21 17:27:22 I fear that our true motivation is about oil and our own flailing economy about the failure to destroy Al Qaeda and about revenge.
3417 2018-02-21 17:27:18 Sri RPN Singh ji has had been perhaps one of the best Petroleum Minister, Country has seen in recent past. Officers of Oil companies remember his Rock solid support. All d best Sir. We need u in Govt.

3430 2018-02-21 17:25:54 I’m from Turner Station ... engineers have never EVEN considered what would happen if oil train derailed! We cannot wait until after the disaster! Any renewable energy projects I support ... time to make a change!!!
3431 2018-02-21 17:25:51 Quit trying to put the blame on Obama. He was a way better President than you and a better family man. You snake oil salesmen.
3432 2018-02-21 17:25:49 Oil market fundamentals suggest the barrel is about to take a big dip, as global growth is not balanced with output potential signals from the MENA region.
3433 2018-02-21 17:25:49 ....and it’s increase and accelerate the production in the conventional oil wells.
Furthermore, this technology is applied in some of the injection wells to increase the Injectivity index for it, which lead to increase the production in the production wells nearby.

3438 2018-02-21 17:25:22 Higher spend in '19 & '20, misguided worry over mix.

3445 2018-02-21 17:24:11 Another "gimmick" by this fraudulent, corrupt and drug trafficking government to try to "suck" money from people who don't understand that the economy of Venezuela is completely bankrupt. The petro is backed by Venezuela's crude oil reserves, the largest in the world...

3447 2018-02-21 17:23:47 Smythe: The problem with pur revenue situation is actually related to democracy. The power of oil companies and our addiction to royalty revenues is the issue. The "least worst option" today is a sales tax. #ableg #abpoli #abbudget

3465 2018-02-21 17:22:33 A big deal ? Yes  , but imagine the Soviets in Stalin’s time installing a leader in Iran instead of the Shah. The Impact of that on gulf oil states and east Africa
3466 2018-02-21 17:22:29 Completely agree. If they had the capacity and freedom to manage the process, they wouldn’t need China or America’s he(interference)lp again. I can’t even be happy they discovered that oil because everyone else will benefit from it before JA does.

3470 2018-02-21 17:22:02 ....the responsibility and monitoring of petrol interceptors seems non existent - how often are flood surges accompanied by an oil slick?
3471 2018-02-21 17:21:56 Nah you wrong. We have technology. It’s your oil of the past. You screwed.
3472 2018-02-21 17:21:48 went to take my car in for an oil change and there’s a gas leak :) nice!

3478 2018-02-21 17:21:17 Lol let’s say the location of the oil find was open to the public.
3479 2018-02-21 17:21:17 Cars are hella fun until you have to do a smog check, get an oil change, get new tires, pay for tags basically anything I have to pay extra for
3480 2018-02-21 17:21:16 Why does Scott Wapner have a show?  He is basically without clue, otherwise known as clueless. @CNBCnow @CNBC
3481 2018-02-21 17:21:13 See, that's also not entirely true. Oil breaks down latex, so it's not a good choice for latex condoms, but it doesn't affect polyurethane (like Trojan Supra) or nitrile (like the FC2 Internal/"Female" Condom) and is completely fine for those.
3482 2018-02-21 17:21:08 Don’t try Miss Beyoncé. Canola oil had to remix & promote the shit out of Havana for it to peak @ #1 for 1 week selling an album for $3.50 when Lemonade never left top 50 on iTunes despite it being the most expensive album there. Keep it cute.
3483 2018-02-21 17:21:08 Oil companies should just stop selling their products in communities that sue them.

Dont you support Americans & other imperial mercenaries?
3491 2018-02-21 17:20:25 @rickyberwick let me rub your body with oil and pose for me
3492 2018-02-21 17:20:14 @karenhunter @DrJasonJohnson T'Challa missed the obvious. Wakanda's actual GDP alone would destabilize the entire world market. It's economy isn't based on the dollar or oil and it owes no nation.
3493 2018-02-21 17:20:09 Jamaica really struck oil? As in real bloodclaat oil that worth Billions or is just a liddle tip a seep out of a pocket?

3495 2018-02-21 17:19:54 Just need a good oil massage right now. Then sleep from now till tomorrow morning. Then wake up to breakfast in bed. **i wish**
3496 2018-02-21 17:19:46 If Jamaica is going to benefit fron oil (as much as the idea revolts me) it stands to lose the very soul of Jamaica at the same time.

Mismanagement with oil has destroyed place like Angola and the only places which have 'prospered' are shallow caves of consumerism
3497 2018-02-21 17:19:41 How could this technique  contribute in enhancing oil recovery?
3498 2018-02-21 17:19:39 @TeamCavuto why is the 10yr Tsy rate not included on your constantly updating oil/gold/dow/etc price band? if we are in an era of rising rates, don't you think updates are in order  i do. Cavuto: Coast to Coast
3499 2018-02-21 17:19:33 There should be no VAT in essential goods

3500 2018-02-21 17:19:26 what it is...is you need pain relief but with the main strong prescription painkillers they upset the ulcers and until they heal, you should not use them as it only makes it worse...the prescription oil won't get rid of the pain completely but it can be digested and can help!!
3501 2018-02-21 17:19:20 what a shame Solar takes a hit while Big Oil feasts.
3502 2018-02-21 17:19:09 Bitumen is not that great an oil product. Way too expensive to manufacture and process. But it's easier for you to make this a partisan attack than deal with any facts. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

3505 2018-02-21 17:18:48 Based on the current price of oil, and the fact we are soon to ‘run out’, it seems quite cheap. I think barrels are being stored in underground bunkers
3506 2018-02-21 17:18:44 Swear!! Like I’m not waiting over an hour for a 20 min oil change. That’s dead 
3507 2018-02-21 17:18:34 When money is speech, oil companies, the NRA and lobbyists can yell louder than we can. I think all of these things are vital, but no one will hear us until campaign financing is cleaned up.
3508 2018-02-21 17:18:26 soon hear the politicians a fight bout who find the oil first.
3509 2018-02-21 17:18:21 Once capital costs have been paid, the oil sands is a low decline, low-cost resource. It's also a lot more like a factory than it is conventional oil production, which enables optimization: big producers now have costs down to $20-$30/b, competitive with US shale.
3510 2018-02-21 17:18:11 Harper added $160 BILLION to our National Debt. Mulroney & Harper accumulated 74% of ALL our Debt. Harper also left crumbling Infrastructure & Econ based on Oil! Why do YOU IGNORE the reality that was left? Do U not comprehend all that has to be fixed? Made up for? #cdnpoli

3527 2018-02-21 17:16:30 We can do so much better like who? England? The country that continues to run down the UK economy through a suicidal Brexit process, whilst doubling our debt in 8 years of government? The same English who squandered our Oil revenues over the last 30 years.
3528 2018-02-21 17:16:05 This guy is a pure idiot. All humans were conquerers. Still are, now we conquer over ideologies vs land. Or for oil. 

We're the youngest, Dumbest country on the globe, trying to tell people in the Dawn of Civilization how they should live.

3531 2018-02-21 17:15:53 with pages supposed area of expertise (oil and petroleum)and his friendship w/Baranov, it begs the question (to me at least), was page actually ignorant of that fact or was he playing coy with his testimony?

3541 2018-02-21 17:15:04 I’m right on a pipeline hub. Oil & propane lines on most our fields.  My house is 1 mile from 30% of US Propane Storage (Conway Ks). Pipelines pay well for damages when they go in/need repair, crops grow better where the pipeline is.   Just have to call 1 call when u dig a hole

3548 2018-02-21 17:14:19 The impact of the hydraulic fracturing in the world economy is high, as this method unlocked huge reserves of oil and natural gas found in shale and other tight-rock formations for some countries that was imported the oil & gas and make it self-dependent.

3551 2018-02-21 17:14:03 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

3558 2018-02-21 17:13:22 You had no prob handing $1.4 trlln of your taxes, via USgov, to bombmakers so the Mil Ind Cmplx could conquer Afghanistan & loot its resources to liberate the blue burqa?

That after they killed 1 mill Iraqis & took over their oil, for non-existent WMDs?

3563 2018-02-21 17:13:09 i've lost track of hearthstone after to much addons... doesnt want to buy all the new cards but also feeling like wild ranked is kinda boring now. From time to time I play 1 or 2 matches oil rouge. Do you play new or old card sets?
3564 2018-02-21 17:13:02 You are exactly right.  This has been going on for weeks, like clock work.  I’m an oil guy, I want to get behind her.  Shit like these tweets make that impossible.  At least be real.
3565 2018-02-21 17:13:01 Try doing a hair treatment with coconut oil perhaps? I'm not very clued up on products. In the UK we have Nioxin which is amazing for dry hair but it's not all natural

3568 2018-02-21 17:12:39 Got an air fryer for my bridal shower and have been using it non stop! We’ve made sweet potato fries and jojos. The air frying option is a healthier alternative to frying because you use little to no oil. When you do, it drips off the food so you aren’t consuming the excess oil.
3569 2018-02-21 17:12:31 That can suck pretty hard. I know some folks who cook unleavened bread from flour, oil, water, and salt over charcoal fires, using discarded refrigerator backs as grills. But a lot of folks are in prison or similar and so don't have the freedom to do things like that.

3572 2018-02-21 17:11:38 Guerrilla information war, indeed. BC is "underdog," energy community is "blinkered," "scared," and "self-serving." And please explain why "economics" argues against TMX or the oil sands.

3575 2018-02-21 17:11:35 At the car show... where emails are more valueable than a barrel of oil. The things people do for a free hat I tell ya
3576 2018-02-21 17:11:21 Is your point that it’s alberta consumers’ discretionary decisions that have caused Alberta to be at top of the pack, not its heavy oil industry?
3577 2018-02-21 17:11:16 you know your uterus to be her pollen downed later than my bite lithe in my Amazon Olive oil
3578 2018-02-21 17:11:13 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a crushing defeat. I am so caned.
3579 2018-02-21 17:11:12 As a nation is the US ready to end its dependence on oil? I am not so sure 2018 is the year for that. Which leads to the 2nd point about safest ways to transport oil. Pipeline by far followed by rail #2 safest way.
3580 2018-02-21 17:11:05 The un nations are mostly anti Zionist or do not want to upset the countries who supply them oil.
3581 2018-02-21 17:11:03 I’m olive oil so i ain’t mad
3582 2018-02-21 17:11:03 I love the book Mix It Up but I also use food coloring in water, oil pastels that we smear together, and Play Doh or Model Magic that we mix together 
3583 2018-02-21 17:11:02 Real easy , oil and gas production nothing to do with Barack , had to do with fracking , see how easy to discredit your bumper stickers !
3584 2018-02-21 17:10:52 moroccan oil styling gel works really well for that! plus it's good for your hair :). your hair is looking fabulous by the way
3585 2018-02-21 17:10:44 Curious data: my old GPU used to get really hot because the thermic grease was too old already (I purchased it in 2013 and it was used). I just cleaned the old grease and changed it for a home made mix with tooth paste and kitchen oil and woila!
It came from 120° to 70° stable
3586 2018-02-21 17:10:41 You both said we would get battered yestursday show aidran 2-0 Goughie 3-1 so 1-1 was good result we played well. Unlucky not to win that game
3587 2018-02-21 17:10:35 So @RepKevinCramer was convinced by Harold Hamm to run for @SenatorHeitkamp's seat which means he'll also be in the pocket of big oil if he were to win. #NDSEN
3588 2018-02-21 17:10:34 Oh it’s morality that’s at fault, well you could start with the entire Whitehouse then taking payoffs from the NRA, taking payoffs from Big Oil, Big Coal Or Cos that entire crap hole would t know morality if it fell on their heads
3589 2018-02-21 17:10:29 Waiting for a oil change and no where to sit. Brutal
3590 2018-02-21 17:10:19 How did I miss this? #OIL CLJ18 falling and my #MachineLearning #algorithm predicted 13 of 15 falling bars correctly; then the sick short-covering rev up @ 61.40. Lousy #ES_F had my attention!

3596 2018-02-21 17:08:43 Making a tidy profit on imported Canadian oil? Seems plausible
3597 2018-02-21 17:08:41 My advice would be to not cheat, reduce fat in general and especially anything containing soybean oil, and limit alcohol. Supplement Mg as tolerated. But that's only diet stuff.
3598 2018-02-21 17:08:36 I don't believe that to be a fact. 82/3% tax on whisky and oil.
3599 2018-02-21 17:08:24 I feel if Jamaica has Oil, we only gonna get poorer. Cuz the Bigger powers( Countries) just ago manipulate the Jamaican Government and Tek Dem Fi eeediiiat
3600 2018-02-21 17:08:18 Yes, the casual observer has it all back to front. Add in likelihood of O&G stocks being pummeled in overall market downturn and capex will get further smoked. Speaking about "oil" is too vague. You have to be specific as to grade. Apples and oranges.
3601 2018-02-21 17:08:01 This bitch just said “ok I see you wit ya perm” um no bitch, it’s called oil and flat irons  tf 
3602 2018-02-21 17:07:55 In fact, US exports have recently been primarily to two countries: Canada and China. The former is 'used' to processing very light US tight oil, the latter-not sure whether it buys the heavier version or the light one.Tough to export to Europe b/c of refinery processing capacity
3603 2018-02-21 17:07:53 Hvala! IFO Heavy Fuel Oil je to slučajno mazut?

3607 2018-02-21 17:07:07 Madraasas can teach all possible subjects including rocket science - for more details refer to the details about "Al-Burāq". It can make you a great economist also - drastic reduction in oil imports can improve the CAD.
No normal school would have these knowledge.
3608 2018-02-21 17:06:51 I was carrying a pot of boiling water and someone had spilled oil on the floor and no cleaned it. Slipped and poured it all over my arms. 

Yas.
3609 2018-02-21 17:06:49 Snake oil salesman, I hope he gets the hell he deserves.
3610 2018-02-21 17:06:37 When it’s not one thing, it’s another. Never a dull moment around here...cause why wouldn’t I want my brakes to go out the day I scheduled my oil change? #fuckmylife #ineedadrink
3611 2018-02-21 17:06:34 If so how does your budget look NASA trusting in that snake oil salesman not a good idea. Liar in chief and swear to the lie @VP

3619 2018-02-21 17:05:12 Proverb of the Day: "The wise store up choice food and olive oil,
    but fools gulp theirs down" (Proverbs 21:20).
3620 2018-02-21 17:05:10 Oh that's a great point. My next show is in April, and luckily my character isn't glam so I don't think it would be a huge problem in the near future. What do you use to remove your eye makeup? Everything in my makeup routine is oil free except my eye makeup remover.
3621 2018-02-21 17:05:07 I’ve never seen cannoli sold w/o refrigeration. But a lot of traditional problems with fried food stem from liquid oil, which I don’t use
3622 2018-02-21 17:05:04 Cleaning out my wishlist makes me realize that I may have a perfume oil obsession. Yikes.
3623 2018-02-21 17:05:03 Yep - the majority of human machines have been damaged by sugar, veg oil and much else - said busted machines now need more careful application of fuel and lube...

3629 2018-02-21 17:04:39 Read a horrible article about keto on Vox.  No discussion of hormones, hunger&satiety mechanisms.  It's that kind of obfuscatory shit that leaves people totally confused and in the dark about objective truths (sugar/grains/seed oil=BAD)
3630 2018-02-21 17:04:36 yeep!! pero magkaibang moisturizer sa gabi at umaga. Sa gabi, Nivea Creme. Kapag papasok ng school, bench argan oil. oily skin ako pero gusto ko kase ng dewy effect ewan ko lang kung ganon gusto mo kase tingin ko kase ang healthy tignan kapag parang nag g glow (??)

3633 2018-02-21 17:04:29 I’ve been slathering on the life brand vitamin e oil cream from shoppers (like it is real thick so it’s amazing) and hyaluronic acid from the ordinary! Glow pixi pads are also key!
3634 2018-02-21 17:04:19 Oil is more a curse to a nation than anything.
3635 2018-02-21 17:04:04 Why not legally produced palm oil?
3636 2018-02-21 17:03:57 @PMOIndia @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp @PetroleumMin  v are importing our 40% of oil from america tht too low quality,y arent v considering angola,nigeria,russia?? n work towrds electronic cars.. so tht v can increase our rupees.
3637 2018-02-21 17:03:57 Very sad to hear about the layoffs at Vox Media. Tons of good people there. Also fuck all platforms that sold "social video" snake oil.
3638 2018-02-21 17:03:52 Bruh, I just needed an oil change 
3639 2018-02-21 17:03:49 A flourishing oil & marijuana industry in tandem would have Jamaica paying off so many things and claiming full ownership in jaw dropping ways.
3640 2018-02-21 17:03:32 Curesty. I have free oil change lol

3644 2018-02-21 17:03:02 I used to cover Curt as a reporter. I know all about him. Going back 25 years, heard he took secret stock in a Russian oil company. Could never pin it down.
3645 2018-02-21 17:03:00 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water.
Miguel de Cervantes
3646 2018-02-21 17:02:57 I got up and it look like my face been in all in oil
3647 2018-02-21 17:02:42 wish yesterday had been better news...but onwards and upwards.
3648 2018-02-21 17:02:40 A great development, from EIA: Recent legislation has directed the sale of more than 100 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
3649 2018-02-21 17:02:19 What do you think would help a country depended so much on oil? Privatizing it even more?
3650 2018-02-21 17:02:17 Question of the day !   How do I moisturize the end of relaxed hair?

 Use a water-based moisturizer first then use a natural or like coconut grapeseed and avocado oil and seal with a cream.Don’t use too much that it will weigh your hair down , this helps lock in moisture in.
3651 2018-02-21 17:02:16 I cannot believe I did every single problem on my math test twice... Why am I so paranoid
3652 2018-02-21 17:02:10 I’m going back for the rose hip oil and will look out for that one too!! Thanks :))
3653 2018-02-21 17:02:08 Actually being productive today. Mary Lee is being groomed so I’m getting my car’s oil changed and tires rotated. Unfortunately there is a talkative man in the waiting room. He has opinions on EVERYTHING.

3655 2018-02-21 17:02:03 In a Nigeria, a ship loaded with oil went missing, a satellite disappeared into thin air, 10 dead people were appointed as Heads of Boards by the President, the National Budget was alleged to be missing, a "snake swallowed N36 m" and now "a monkey swallowed N70m". What a country.
3656 2018-02-21 17:02:02 McGowan: The last time Alberta put money into the Heritage savings fund was 1987. After that, AB spent all its oil and gas revenue to cover over our inadequate tax revenue. #abpoli #ableg #abbudget
3657 2018-02-21 17:02:00 Now I can't think of any other way to call oil

3662 2018-02-21 17:01:52 Rachel, spell out for us how much money we working class people will get from this pipeline. Most money will go to big US oil companies right?
3663 2018-02-21 17:01:46 Apolgies if their triumph over adversity doesn’t fit your Nazi conspiracy. 

However, the father of the Koch brothers who notably fund the GOP amassed the family fortune through a Nazi oil refinery.

Makes you think, right?


3664 2018-02-21 17:01:42 Not denying them. Just laughing (howling actually) at the thought they could be compared in any way with the moonscape now dripping over Northern Alberta from 2 spills a day and years of US funded oil & gas mining!
3665 2018-02-21 17:01:31 一文や台詞 ってことだからほんとに一文しか考えてない でも普段何も考えないで生きてるから滅茶苦茶頭使う
3666 2018-02-21 17:01:25 Because coconut oil does not harm silicone toys, contrary to this article's unsubstantiated claims.
3667 2018-02-21 17:01:23 Your doctor will always encourage preventative health. So will a mechanic! Don't underestimate the importance of a regular oil change
3668 2018-02-21 17:00:53 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
3669 2018-02-21 17:00:53 Lol so them finally start Digging into my back to see thats where Jamaica's oil has been. I could have told you.

3673 2018-02-21 17:00:44 As @charllehnsherr said, we must have a dayshift and nightshift MI5 agent watching us. Therefore I would like to declare that my dayshift agent is called Duncan Buck (He’s an undercover FBI agent who was raised on an oil rig by 90 men and 1 prostitute.) Rex is my nightshift boo.
3674 2018-02-21 17:00:38 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

3676 2018-02-21 17:00:23 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!

3679 2018-02-21 17:00:17 Palm oil is a cost effective method of producing oil for the use of it in large Multi national companies 
The fries and the chicken you eat in some restaurants are made by palm oil 
The lotion that you apply to moisturizer your skin is made of palm oil
Palm oil is much cheaper...

3685 2018-02-21 16:59:22 Saudi Arabia has nationalized their oil industry too. They, as you pointed out, survived oil prices dropping. Why was it different for them?

3687 2018-02-21 16:59:07 McGowan: The idea of the "Alberta advantage" under conservative governments was a mirage. Low taxes were only possible with high oil & gas prices. Times have changed. #ableg #abpoli #abbudget

3689 2018-02-21 16:58:52 I need a oil change and a new tire 
3690 2018-02-21 16:58:43 Amazing that oil executives still think they will have air to breathe when there’s no air left.
3691 2018-02-21 16:58:32 Coal trilogy: cannot prove that all the coal mined & traded was not used only for putting in bad kids stockings

3692 2018-02-21 16:58:29 My break line was giving me issues and I needed an oil change so I took it to get those taken care of. Turns out I need 2 new Tie rods, tires, and a rotation too.
3693 2018-02-21 16:58:17 Came to get my oil change and it’s taking over an hour and my child is being an asshole send help

3696 2018-02-21 16:57:53 It won't work. It's backed by assets that you can't seize because they're underground. Even if an international court ruled in you favor, you would still need to pump the oil.

3699 2018-02-21 16:57:42 Ulta gave me a " juice infused lip oil " as my birthday gift and... It's just barely tinted lip gloss that's like sugarless cherry Kool-Aid flavor?
3700 2018-02-21 16:57:42 I apply almond oil every night  n slightly heated olive oil occasionally
3701 2018-02-21 16:57:40 We buy them from the store and bake them in the oven. Then they need to drip the excess oil. But really good when you crave the crunch . Been #ketolife for five months now. Down 40 lbs.
3702 2018-02-21 16:57:39 I think it’s great fundamentally but I generally don’t have as much fun with 2D sonic. Also Oil Ocean Zone is ass.

3711 2018-02-21 16:56:42 D2 duh
3712 2018-02-21 16:56:32 So you don't:
drive a car (gasoline) (asphalt)
Fly (jet fuel)
Shop in stores, boating, ride a train (Diesel fuel)
Heat you home (fuel oil)
Grill, take a shower,dry your clothes (propane)

3715 2018-02-21 16:56:16 ....from the collection of the oil-family scion and his wife Peggy. Rockefeller, grandson of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, died in March at the age of 101. His family is selling the art collection to benefit cultural, educational, medical and environmental charities.

3718 2018-02-21 16:56:04 When the pound drops, Fuel costs to us increase, because Thatcher sold the National oil producer we now have to get our oil at $ prices, fuel goes up, prices go up. #Brexit caused the dip in the pound. QED.    Oh, & a lot more is coming.....

3720 2018-02-21 16:55:29 Was having a shitty day then heard the news today! Billy Graham is dead. There is a god! Now just waiting for Pat's rotten ass to kick it. These "evangelist" are nothing more than snake oil salesmen. Nothing 'christian' about it.
3721 2018-02-21 16:55:12 @Oil_Check #followback?  
3722 2018-02-21 16:55:08 because it was stupidly wrong
3723 2018-02-21 16:55:01 Can i ask you then , where do you think oil comes from?  And you do know what it is right?     maybe gods a nascar fan
3724 2018-02-21 16:54:58 I believe that I'm understanding why CBD oil is being held in such high regards.
3725 2018-02-21 16:54:49 Ugh sorry to hear that. I just dropped a few hundred on my car last week when I was getting an oil change. Not fun.
3726 2018-02-21 16:54:47 all i wanted was an oil change, not to find out i need three new tires. i'm STRESSED
3727 2018-02-21 16:54:47 They're comparable only because they are both so reliant on the same industry (oil)
3728 2018-02-21 16:54:42 As you know University of Pennsylvania graduate President Trump says "fake news". I wonder if Today Show talent is going just out of curiousity will take the name Swaney and change a few letters just to ask Jim Dolan any questions with the New York Rangers. Think Houston Oil
3729 2018-02-21 16:54:24 I pulled up to the dealership for an oil change. The dude was like 2 things:
1. Your car smells amazing  
2. You need to take that steering wheel off. It’s entirely too much  I’m dead
3730 2018-02-21 16:54:23 He was talking to Nixon who was paranoid about Jews. A year later Nixon saved Israel when he forced resupply in the YK War, defying State, Big Oil & Kissinger. It's sometimes complicated.
3731 2018-02-21 16:54:07 And many countries in the Middle East provided the oil that fueled the apartheid government. Are you boycotting them too?Why don’t you also spend a moment and look into who Arafat really was and what he really stood for. Don’t sell SA history short.
3732 2018-02-21 16:54:06 Yes. You are right. But there is also a limit of how much very light US tight oil can be exported: quality differences and refineries capacity to process it; declining Brent-WTI spread; Libya and Nigeria (light) oil production resurgence, etc.
3733 2018-02-21 16:54:04 "Data is the new oil? No: Data is the new soil." ~David McCandless
3734 2018-02-21 16:53:59 Nope, he's an icon. He's the King of Gay Twitter. Deal with it!
3735 2018-02-21 16:53:49 There is solid proof that putin ships oil to north Korea. Trump has done nothing to stop them,when he thought china was he condemned them. He is in bed with putin and will not do anything to stop this.
3736 2018-02-21 16:53:34 Feliciano Beilschmidt. will you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
3737 2018-02-21 16:53:26 Time for that nasty old snake oil seller to pay up. I hope he gets the hell he deserves.
3738 2018-02-21 16:53:20 You guys should blame the organising body of the game in the country. If it continues this way we will keep going down till we hit oil with the way the game is being organized.
3739 2018-02-21 16:53:12 You keep bothering me after you told *me* to go away. We disagree. I think you’re extremely wrong. You keep trying to get my attention. I’m trying to shake you off.
3740 2018-02-21 16:53:04 At any given time they're all moving in the same direction operationally. The move from oil towards NG a few years ago is one example. Ditto for everyone rushing to get in on the Permian. It's tough to successfully invest in a space like that.
3741 2018-02-21 16:52:55 Lol. Don’t you need to change the oil in the fryer?
3742 2018-02-21 16:52:41 Closing prices: #Ftse100 0.48% #DAX -0.14% #CAC 0.23% #Estoxx50 -0.15% #GBPUSD 1.3942 #EURGBP 0.8826 #GILTBUND 0.0 #Gold -0.04% #Oil -0.32%
3743 2018-02-21 16:52:40 Olive Oil as a stand-alone *can* get a little sticky once exposed to air, though, hence seeing it blended at low percentages. (Items are listed greatest to lowest percentage/amounts.)

3745 2018-02-21 16:52:35 Charcoal masks and toothpaste,  a moon lamp, now an essential oil diffuser. I wonder what twitter will tell me I need next !!!!
3746 2018-02-21 16:52:31 Earn their billions? Think you should do some research United's money comes from sponsors. The Glazers also were involved in the Oil Industry. Embarrassing how little these rags know about their own club

3749 2018-02-21 16:52:20 I've just discovered the magic of beard oil and honestly I can't understand why I never used it.
3750 2018-02-21 16:52:19 "Hatch was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Hatch has received over $470,000 from oil, gas,coal interests since 2012"
3751 2018-02-21 16:52:17 Hahaha . Your head get oil
3752 2018-02-21 16:51:32 Good stuff. I do need more VitE oil. I have a nice massage blend that I may just mess with: rice bran oil, almond oil, fractionated (liquid) coconut oil, and a touch of liquid soybean oil. One day I'll buy a pre-blend so I don't have to measure.

3755 2018-02-21 16:51:29 I highly recommend oil pulling everyyy morning!
3756 2018-02-21 16:51:27 I think they closed the place I get my oil changed
3757 2018-02-21 16:51:22 @SecretaryPerry You are doing a great job at the energy department. As we keep producing oil and increase our exports we are weakening Putin and Russia! Keep up the good work.
3758 2018-02-21 16:51:12 and you canola oil stans refuse to learn the truth behind the performance  go do ya research
3759 2018-02-21 16:51:11 OMG Jeremy  when did anyone listen or do what the UN wanted  These 3 Countries are shamefully allowing Palistinians and Syrians to suffer  all in the name of warmongering, Oil , Money 
3760 2018-02-21 16:51:07 Thank you Ginger! Still cannot follow.
3761 2018-02-21 16:50:59 I’ve been at Kia for an hour and some change. All I wanted was an oil change.
3762 2018-02-21 16:50:51 #Historywoman blocked me a looooooong time ago. Something about my Indy facts being "fairy wishes". ie, new oil fields being found & that they were fairly big= Fairy wishes. .
3763 2018-02-21 16:50:46 where’s the lavender oil at
3764 2018-02-21 16:50:43 yeah i was exactly the same on prednisone a couple of years ago, it was a miracle for a few weeks and then would come back worse. they've just bought out cannabis oil over here in the UK (omg!!) so i'm going to try that 
3765 2018-02-21 16:50:38 This part of me was telling me that oil could be discover in Jamaica. Just hope if it will be state owned and controlled instead of foreign companies

3767 2018-02-21 16:50:30 I don’t know, ask snake oil salesman, @GovMikeHuckabee
3768 2018-02-21 16:50:26 RINs have nothing to do with price at the pumps. It enables small producers and retailers to compete with big oil, who own you.

3771 2018-02-21 16:50:00 The oil sands are statistically insignificant. They are a rounding error as far as global emissions are concerned.

You could ramp up the oil sands by 100% and it wouldn't statistically change global total emissions.
3772 2018-02-21 16:49:48 Try seeing a real doctor instead of rubbing tea tree oil all over yourself and duct taping your face
3773 2018-02-21 16:49:47 I've read plenty of stuff about using EV Olive Oil on its own, but I also read about one of the vitamins being really important too.

Although I think that's more for nail strength.
3774 2018-02-21 16:49:42 Conditioning treatments weekly, and hot oil treatments monthly! Avoid any chemicals if possible and use serum daily!
3775 2018-02-21 16:49:40 It’s hard! Try using some oil and dramatic lighting (for shadows)
3776 2018-02-21 16:49:33 Happy birthday and enjoy!

Or otherwise, does it indicate that a consensus is about to appear in the horizon? #Russia #KSA #OPEC #Syria #Oil

3781 2018-02-21 16:48:52 What if the bike drips oil on the platform!
3782 2018-02-21 16:48:50 Kinda wickedness dat? Thing smell like spoil codliver oil
3783 2018-02-21 16:48:39 This reminds me of an oil puddle! But like in a good way lol
3784 2018-02-21 16:48:35 It’s not good lol. It’s not explicitly bad, but the particles of coconut oil are too big to actually go into your pores, so you’re not actually any nourishment from it. It’s not actually hydrating your skin, it just clogs your pores so everything feels smooth. It’s a sealant.
3785 2018-02-21 16:48:30 JUST LIKE ARABS FOR OIL; WE DEPEND TO MUCH ON TWITTER TO GET OUR WORD OUT! NEED ALTERNATIVE!

3789 2018-02-21 16:47:56 You've resorted to “you’re lonely” and “mental midget”.  You lost-both arguments and now you’ve resorted to name calling.
3790 2018-02-21 16:47:50 Chalk or oil pastels?
3791 2018-02-21 16:47:36 You probably don't need it, but the ingredient list on this stuff is:

Jojoba Wax Ester, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Fragrance Oil, Olive Squalene, Vitamin A (Retinol), Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Tea Tree Oil
3792 2018-02-21 16:47:34 You know you want your TITS massaged with oil, I'll send some one around too massage those TITS.

3795 2018-02-21 16:47:25 Gives a new meaning to "Snake Oil"
3796 2018-02-21 16:47:25 wah kinda oil?
3797 2018-02-21 16:47:20 Great call. Do u have a bid below market in oil or Do u think todays lows will hold?
3798 2018-02-21 16:47:14 Marine Oil Spills 101: A relatively small spill, such as the 1988 Nestucca barge incident, can cause widespread damage, whereas a tanker incident involving the total loss of cargo, such as the 1993 Braer incident, caused relatively minor damage.

3800 2018-02-21 16:46:51 Venezuela has just released the petro, a digital currency backed by the full faith and credit of the Venezuelan government (and vague notions about oil). Forgive my stupidity - how’s that different to the bolivar?
3801 2018-02-21 16:46:44 2 months with no oil in my car and I’ve finally put some in, surprise the poor thing didn’t blow up
3802 2018-02-21 16:46:41 BREAKING: #Venezuela starts #PETRO its own #Cryptocurrency - Collected US$735 million in the first 20 hours. Value of PETRO coupled to crude #oil-price. @RalfKlein8888 @CapitalJon @mektronik @PaulGambles2 @Halsrethink
3803 2018-02-21 16:46:34 Depends on what it is used for and your own preferences. I like OH YES. (I think that is the name of it) it is oil based and thick...a little goes a long ways but it doesn't dry up or absorb like water based.

Of not using a toy I like silicone based.

3812 2018-02-21 16:45:31 I have a stick of solid coconut oil which is gorgeous.
3813 2018-02-21 16:45:25 $AMR / Alta Mesa highlights the hatred on energy.  Former SPAC to hat bought assets with oil in $40s. Oil +20% since. Equity value -20%.
3814 2018-02-21 16:45:16 IDS sounds like he wants to allow clinical trials to validate his own brand of snake oil

3817 2018-02-21 16:45:06 #DrivingTip: Examine your engine oil level at least once a week or more if you drive high mileage.
3818 2018-02-21 16:45:02 “When the oil runs out, our President will die,” sang the Russian rock band DDT.   “Putin has built a system where he controls everything apart from the only thing that matters: the price of oil.” Ivan Krastev:
3819 2018-02-21 16:45:02 おっさーーん！！好き！！！
3820 2018-02-21 16:44:56 All I want to do is go to Greece and eat tzatziki and gyros and baklava and get really tan and exclusively wear white with blue and yellow accents and bathe in olive oil and wine
3821 2018-02-21 16:44:47 Yeah, no amount of oil or lotion helps Nija men from crocodile tough dry hands
3822 2018-02-21 16:44:40 @ymjauthor That sounds amazing -- great choices! Well, if you ever want to spice up your cooking a little more, check out our olive oil. :)
3823 2018-02-21 16:44:40 Thank you for the suggestion. My niece recently started singing the praises of CBD oil as well.
3824 2018-02-21 16:44:38 The good news is the Oil and Gas Industry is expecting record profits!!! Yay, for those stockholders, hope the enjoy their gains off the backs of our children’s futures.
3825 2018-02-21 16:44:35 If Kenya pumped out its crude oil at the rate of Saudi Arabia, its proven reserves of 600m (last week's BD reported its actually 526m) barrels would vanish in 52 days.
3826 2018-02-21 16:44:33 YOU’VE DRIPPED OIL ON US FOR 49 YEARS
THANK YOU
3827 2018-02-21 16:44:29 Their eyelash curler and cleansing oil are both fantastic.

3829 2018-02-21 16:44:11 Like I put on shea butter and body oil and my hands look like fucking chalk.
3830 2018-02-21 16:44:04 what snake oil salesman convinced all those news sites to pivot to video?
3831 2018-02-21 16:44:04 Evidence of what, that US hasn't gone to war with SA, but has sold them weapons and bought their oil?
Wow, you do live in a hole if you need me to provide that evidence (can't prove the first, it's a negative anyway).
3832 2018-02-21 16:44:03 Just told Spouse about this discussion and he asked if I could make him some cuticle oil "but without the lemon." Good, because I have every fragrance *but* that on hand. (And I get to use my 1oz dropper bottles now too.)

3834 2018-02-21 16:44:01 Use olive oil, works so well
3835 2018-02-21 16:43:24 Interesting comparison. One point that needs to be noted is that comparing Transport sector to Oil sands development is tricky, as oil sands development doesn't include land use change, foregone sequestration from land use change, meaning emissions significantly higher.
3836 2018-02-21 16:43:12 追いオリーブもいいけど、追いフォローもよろしくな。
3837 2018-02-21 16:43:11 Oil don’t bring nothing but incredible highs and heartbreaking lows. I badly wish this region would say no to it but alas.

And some smoke rises-

"Motherfucker-"
3841 2018-02-21 16:43:04 Nah this oil finding honestly has given me major anxiety and our governments will just see dollar signs I am stressed
3842 2018-02-21 16:42:59 unfortunately, yeah. And pretty much by design.  I need to re-find that article I read about how fox news grew up around and because of predatory snake oil companies targeting seniors. BUT EVEN UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S SO FRUSTRATING
3843 2018-02-21 16:42:58 Billy Graham was a con artist and snake oil salesman who bilked millions out of their hard earned money...you are better than this Sir
3844 2018-02-21 16:42:54 First time I observe than even on a per capita basis, SK and AB have a big problem in transportation also. The pickup culture? An indirect results from the oil and gas industry (both from the way they work in oil and gas and cheap oil)?

3851 2018-02-21 16:41:53 ...and left me to drive it back to the garage myself, the garage have said my oil pump is faulty and it’s £600 for parts only
3852 2018-02-21 16:41:51 The one good thing about Trump passing a gun law is that a progressive judge somewhere will jump up and block it.
3853 2018-02-21 16:41:49 If we got oil, it needs to be government regulated.

Not controlled by some private company
3854 2018-02-21 16:41:45 More propaganda to further elite pipeline and oil interests. How do you sleep at night? Perhaps USA will bring Ghouta some "democracy" like the completely destroyed nations of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, or Yugoslovia.

3860 2018-02-21 16:41:21 I need to finish cleaning my cupboard tops. I have the bucket, Murphy's Oil Soap, gloves, & rags in the kitchen. Told myself I would do it after I prepped supper. Supper is prepped, & now I am thinking it is a good idea to make pumpkin bread for the church breakfast on Sunday.
3861 2018-02-21 16:41:19 Single. Like you cut a recipe by 32? 1 Tbs Flour, 1 tsp sugar, 1 bump of oil
3862 2018-02-21 16:41:14 Johnny showed me how to put air in a tire, change a tire, check and change my oil. I still call him to change my oil and tires though.
3863 2018-02-21 16:41:12 So far the Republican response to the death of children at the hands of the NRA has been to throw oil on the fire.

They claim that to battle guns, we should put more guns in schools. That’s dumb.

The math is as simple as 1+1=2, what we want is 1-1=0!
3864 2018-02-21 16:41:07 Oil is good. So is a bit of balm

3867 2018-02-21 16:41:02 Remember Oil is part of Military Industrial Complex! Now Russia desperately needs to sell oil for it's servival! Koch's are the Biggest Domestic Terrorist we have!Their in our school boards & are Universities!That's why civics & political science! This must end now! Vote them out
3868 2018-02-21 16:40:57 but who has a spray bottle of vegetable oil...that's where you lose me
3869 2018-02-21 16:40:54 Everyone but Jamaicans will benefit from this oil discovery.
3870 2018-02-21 16:40:43 We are selling oil to the USA they are reselling it to world markets at a profit! Anyone who is in apposition of getting our oil and LNG to shoreline is a traitor of Canada !
McKenna is onside with the USA  with her treasonous actions!
3871 2018-02-21 16:40:38 Just elect Kenney as Premier of AB & watch him boost the price AB gets for its oil. Why he will just legislate higher prices...oh, wait he wouldn’t do that because he believes in the ‘free market’ so how is he going to ensure better prices for AB oil?
3872 2018-02-21 16:40:33 #oil Bloomberg just reported that the increase in shale will cover the increase demand for the next two years according to IEA
3873 2018-02-21 16:40:30 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
3874 2018-02-21 16:40:28 ... I call the RAC who took 2 hours to get to me, which of course by that time my engine had cooled, so my oil pressure had decreased...
3875 2018-02-21 16:40:18 But if you're bored you could always complain about your life on here and watch the snake oil salesmen set in.

3882 2018-02-21 16:39:37 Eventually ALL of these bigoted, anti-gay, snake oil selling theocrats will die off. Hopefully more people today are teaching their children how to think for themselves, rather than selling them certainty and stifling their curiosity about the universe

3884 2018-02-21 16:39:29 Also beard oil!
3885 2018-02-21 16:39:21 I could smell this coming from a mile off. Trinidad by itself has huge oil & natural gas reserves that dwarf the US. You start poking around Guyana and the rest of the Caribbean, it gets very interesting and lucrative for these companies
3886 2018-02-21 16:39:18 What's even nicer is mashed avocado and tuna slices in olive oil with added salt. It's known as Tunacado. The mashing is a bit onerous.
3887 2018-02-21 16:39:18 หนูก็คิดว่าบัตรนั่ง เผลอๆก็ไปนั่งบนดอยนู่นน  ไม่เคยนั่งดอยเลย อยากลอง ไปดูทะเลสีเขียว  แต่อีกใจคือเห็นกัซตัวเท่าเม็ดส้ม กำลังคิดอยู่ว่านั่งรถไปไกลแล้ว ยังต้องไปมองผช.จากไกลๆอีกเหรอ ชีวิต 555

3890 2018-02-21 16:38:59 Alberta doesn't actually care about anything but their oil. If their pipeline leaks in BC, do you think they will care?
3891 2018-02-21 16:38:53 black panther was really great!! but on the way back i got groceries and i accidentally broke a bottle of sesame oil so i'm gonna smell like that for a week probably

3893 2018-02-21 16:38:36 I just had to scroll thru the pics, but yeah grow out that beard, trim ya headtop hair a bit, use some beard oil to make it shine and not itch, and then prosper King 
3894 2018-02-21 16:38:31 Jip. ...that's exactly the reason. In SA they only entertained few cases. I know a guy that had his engine replaced free of charge at Hatfield Audi...but I wasn't so lucky. All they did was to update the car manual to say it's normal for that car to consume that much oil.
3895 2018-02-21 16:38:28 I just realized that I go on vacation in 2 weeks and the only thing I have planned are points of destinations that interest me and making sure I get my oil changed before hand .

3915 2018-02-21 16:36:02 “More expensive oil is still a tax on consumers. But that tax is increasingly offset by the boost to energy investment, production and jobs.”

Higher oil prices is a tax on low income consumers and the boost is going elsewhere. Q is what are the long term consequences of that.

3938 2018-02-21 16:32:42 He wants to soak our public lands in oil. He has been bought and paid to do just that.
3939 2018-02-21 16:32:41 I couldn’t find my coconut oil this morning. So I had to put on my organic lavender lotion  

I’m content.
3940 2018-02-21 16:32:35 I dislike people with their heads up their asses!
We are selling oil to the USA they are selling it to the world at a profit
3941 2018-02-21 16:32:26 Our office sandwich burn test should be more fun. Im sure it will burn brighter because of all the oil.
3942 2018-02-21 16:32:14 I'm all for it, Petro vs Tether? I'll go with the oil barrels and pariah socialist state any day.
3943 2018-02-21 16:32:10 Nice +3.1% move in $BABA. Added a little to her position last wk. This in combo w/ $PGJ (China ETF) & $RSX (Russia ETF) is part of a small but growing #DragonBear theme investment based on future oil moves, China growth & hegemonic (failing #DebtPig) changes on the wind.
3944 2018-02-21 16:32:06 I'm finally allowed to follow again. After reporting TwitterSupport for their abuse?
3945 2018-02-21 16:31:58 Basically, left-wing governments, have been elecyed for shortish bursts, punctuating long periods of right wing dictatorships. If you ever watched Dallas, you’ll understand why oil companies prefer doing business with the latter. Hence Saudi Arabia, and the whole Middle East.
3946 2018-02-21 16:31:53 Also I note that the oil industry major players are buying up assets in the recession so I guess some of them are doing just fine. It's surprising that the industry dumps workers at every downturn and folks just don't retrain and find jobs in other fields. @OilGasCanada
3947 2018-02-21 16:31:50 No oil or butter in the house.

My fried eggs suffered immensely.
3948 2018-02-21 16:31:44 Historically,  BC Ferries--not commercial freighters--has been responsible for the largest share of fuel spills on BC's coast.  Hopefully, oil spills on BC's coast will be much reduced when BC Ferries converts their vessels to LNG.

3951 2018-02-21 16:31:16 Did you know Wardlaw's Poultry Farm is able to work with existing cooking oil containers such as Molok or Frontline that may be owned by the restaurant or landlord?  YES WE CAN!
3952 2018-02-21 16:31:15 “Thats called a snake oil salesman!”

3955 2018-02-21 16:31:12 Biotin it helps with nails & skin too but I noticed I got really hairy taking it lol also making a coconut & aloe Vera gel mask for your hair, it’s works like magic, get the silicone conditioner it’s amazing & castor oil is hella bomb too
3956 2018-02-21 16:31:09 As long as u keep up with your oil changes u should be ok tho but for me, I literally just drive to school and work :(
3957 2018-02-21 16:31:06 The River Lea is blighted by pollution. Let's be clear - dumping oil is illegal and environmental criminals must be prosecuted. 
Every business has a duty to make sure its waste is disposed of properly. Failure to do so is negligence & it's rivers like the Lea that suffer.
3958 2018-02-21 16:31:03 Good riddance to yet another snake oil salesman.

3964 2018-02-21 16:30:46 I promise you, Clean & Clear oil free daily exfoliating face wash will be the best thing you ever by! It’s amazing!
3965 2018-02-21 16:30:42 Nonsense. It's well-heeled oil workers and TORY voters up there, farmers etc., that have pushed Aberdeen prices up! Thank THEM for the cost of housing. Then go & thank your tory/labour councillors for the Aberdeen mess that THEY created.
3966 2018-02-21 16:30:38 It’s a huge honor from one artist to another. Bryan Trent Fair turned one of my photos of David Miller in this gorgeous portrait in oil.
3967 2018-02-21 16:30:36 No, it’s a cooling (tower) water treatment sludge. It is non-toxic, and defintely not associated with oil/gas wastes or deposits from geologic formation, if that’s what you mean by TENORM (from my understanding).

3978 2018-02-21 16:29:35 The oil industry was hugely beneficial to creating today's world and powering amazing technology. We are grateful for that. However, we didn't realize it was also poisoning our planet. We call on you to use your huge wealth to STOP marketing to us and funding bogus studies.
3979 2018-02-21 16:29:32 Things started getting bad when Hugo Chavez came to power in 2002 and nationalized private business, chief. Btw any guesses on why oil prices crashed in 2012? US fracking innovation. Of course Venuzuela couldn’t keep up with productive extraction.
3980 2018-02-21 16:29:21 yea it works, I use to use it all the time then stopped I can def tell the difference from when I was using them and when I wasn’t, I also just bought their hair oil with my 1 month supply so I can start again...my hair grew a lot since Dec of 2016

4039 2018-02-21 16:23:56 Is there any financial instrument that lets people bet that a barrel won't be produced, and lets an oil company bet that it will be?
4040 2018-02-21 16:23:54 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
4041 2018-02-21 16:23:54 Don’t get too confused, they are only 30% plant, 70% of the bottle is still oil based plastic.. food for thought  @ecoforlife bottles are 100% plant based !!

4052 2018-02-21 16:22:09 So I've started using this cuticle oil because the skin around my fingernails is perpetually awful and I have a strong interest in stopping having hangnails.

It smells really nice and also familiar in a good way but I can't figure out what it reminds me of. Just something nice.

4068 2018-02-21 16:20:30 No. I’m not. Oil and gas is not subsidized in for example my native country of Denmark. It is in fact the opposite; it is heavily taxed. Those are the facts. In contrast to e.g. wind and solar which is ONLY exists in e.g. Denmark because of the massive subsidies #dkpol #dkgreen
4069 2018-02-21 16:20:29 Update: coconut oil, heavy cream and stevia coffee is MUCH better without the butter
4070 2018-02-21 16:20:29 Crabby I believe the correct term is hush money.  Trump is a Russian operative pure & simple.  Read the  steele dossier which I sure you already have.  Money Russian Exxon oil deal. Trump has sold us down the river
4071 2018-02-21 16:20:16 That 9 min workout kicked my butt, oh I can’t wait for my CBD oil to get here!
4072 2018-02-21 16:20:10 Yeah rings are not suitable for the pistons oil creeps through. The whole world knows this, audi fixes this in Europe and America at their own cost, in SA they pick and choose
4073 2018-02-21 16:20:03 There was a lot of scaremongering about jobs going abroad IF UK voted to leave. Nothing has come of it. Im happy to let it all go ahead and then see how it pans out. Look at all the crap that was spouted when Scottish Indie vote was going ahead. About North Sea oil running out.
4074 2018-02-21 16:20:00 i went in for a $30 oil change and tire rotation and am walking out with a $300 repair aka im about to have breakdown #2 in a mcdonald’s today
4075 2018-02-21 16:19:55 If I ever got a tattoo, I would like to have a shopping list in a number if different languages. I would start with chestnuts, (kastanje, chataignes, kastanes) and then add a variety of vegetables, cider vinegar and a bar of olive oil soap.
4076 2018-02-21 16:19:53 Groom time is much shorter. (15-20 min) to 2-5min) But you still need to wash and condition the same way, and use beard oil and balm.
4077 2018-02-21 16:19:41 Sell your island buy all that land and protect it then.  Also, I'll stop buying palm oil.  What is palm oil used for?
4078 2018-02-21 16:19:26 Lmao coconut oil dries the sperm?

4080 2018-02-21 16:19:20 When you claim the NRA should support Castille that is what you are claiming.  He lied on 4473, carried illegally-and can’t be rationally differentiated from drug dealers carrying guns and drugs.
4081 2018-02-21 16:19:13 My body is straight glowingI’ve been moisturizing my body and hair  with coconut oil. And my face with raw aloe vera.
4082 2018-02-21 16:19:08 The curse of the oil. How prepared are we? Reactive or proactive?
4083 2018-02-21 16:19:08 I hate to be the one to say this, but a vast majority of gun crimes - even mass shootings, do not use "assault rifles".  So it would be like attempting to ban oil slicks on the back of cars to stop accidents from happening.

4110 2018-02-21 16:15:53 It’s not consumer consumption, it’s industry. The oil produced releases far more ghg when it’s burned, elsewhere.

I've yet to see a single person object to the use of oil in mnfg
It's burning it that is destroying the planet

U R blinded by greed & ignorance
The victims of #climate change mean nothing to you
4120 2018-02-21 16:15:18 I'm not sure I get the last paragraph. How is there more oil, either in supply or reserves? It's also over simplified; it ignores NAFTA vs TPP, and it ignores economies of scale which are pretty essential in trans-ocean oil transport and account for the lack of trade w/Japan rn.
4121 2018-02-21 16:15:16  time fa an oil change !  I’m happy I get these hos free !

4131 2018-02-21 16:14:14 The hydraulic fracturing technique is a process of extracting oil or natural gas by injecting a mixture of water, sand or gravel, and certain chemicals (crosslinked fluid & Sand) under high pressure to the hard/tight formation till a point where it will break apart and..cont.
4132 2018-02-21 16:14:13 Oil prices are up +106% in 2 years buddy. Check out the wealth in other petro-states like Saudi Arabia.
4133 2018-02-21 16:14:12 I advocate all that. Didn’t you tell me to “go away” recently?
4134 2018-02-21 16:14:12 For me, it's the splattering, clean up, dealing with used oil. It's a me thing.
4135 2018-02-21 16:14:07 There are rules to increasing your anointing! Being the BIGGER PERSON actually grows your oil! Listen to me church... Withstanding the pressure to be petty produces power! 
4136 2018-02-21 16:14:03 Lmao I'm getting my oil changed and instead of telling me to back up and straighten the car out, the man told me to back up and arch my back... what dis mean
4137 2018-02-21 16:14:02 The GOP certainly found the most dreadful family they could find to occupy the WH!

4142 2018-02-21 16:13:44 So making the education system worse is ok cuz it was already bad? And I’m not arguing dumb semantics with you. Oil drilling is dangerous cuz accidents happen and we depend on those sources. Why do u need to see a fact in print to draw that conclusion. It’s happened.
4143 2018-02-21 16:13:26 ยังไงก็ต้องไปอ่ะแนน
4144 2018-02-21 16:13:15 "Have what is coming to them"...yeah sounds like advocating violence against NRA members...
4145 2018-02-21 16:13:14 Agreed, yesterday's RNS was the most unpolishable of turds, Sanderson's effort to do would have been funny if lots of naive people hadn't been screwed. But ultimately who will fund dilutions if it turns out it's just too difficult to get that oil out of the ground?

4151 2018-02-21 16:12:48 I feel we don't need politicians, but rather, a good accountant with a dynamic team who would use the currency provided by oil to build factories to exploit this wealth and to increase the Labour market for all who want to work.
4152 2018-02-21 16:12:47 I kinda want to DJ under the name EVOO and give out bread, olive oil, and balsamic vinaigrette at shows lol
4153 2018-02-21 16:12:44 if you want the hair on your head to grow like the hair in between your legs , use wild growth oil 
4154 2018-02-21 16:12:40 I’m afraid I don’t notice who follows me or not. What I have noticed is that I’m getting a bunch of requests to follower people who have nothing in common with me. A lot from Arab countries but also a lot of half naked women. I block those immediately but WTF is that?
4155 2018-02-21 16:12:38 Literally go anywhere for an oil change idk what they exactly have in Kent but Anywhere I go it’s usually 30-40 bucks and they put air in ur tires and windshield wiper fluid and whatever else u need done (:

4165 2018-02-21 16:12:11 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.
4166 2018-02-21 16:11:54 @chigrl Chi, will we see $100 oil in the next 3 or 4 years? Ever? What does your crystal ball tell you?
4167 2018-02-21 16:11:43 Thank you. His flying habits add insult to the injuries of his policies on public health & safety. We know he cut & pasted from oil & gas lobbyists rather than represent the welfare of Oklahomans. Now, he's doing that at a national scale -- while kicking sand in our faces.ENOUGH.
4168 2018-02-21 16:11:34 They can't produce food or cloth or oil for the citizen and you think there gone be able to produce over look and create the tech for crypto.. amazing talk about scams.. the first con  backed by a drug cartel and finances by the hunger and blood from there own people.
4169 2018-02-21 16:11:33 What people don't see is all the medical benefits and products. CBD oil is extremely beneficial to people who have chronic pain, seizure disorders, mental health issues, and inflammation. CBD oil is available without producing the high sensations.
4170 2018-02-21 16:11:29 Says me-and logic & reason.  You have to claim its reasonable for NRA to advocate & should support people that 1).  Lie to federal gov to buy guns. 2) advocate for people to use drugs and buy guns 3) Support people Carrying guns and drugs.   Its a no brainer who’s right here.

4177 2018-02-21 16:11:11 That said, most people hate frying because liquid oils smell awful/leave a lingering odor/feel greasy. Refined coconut oil does none of that

4183 2018-02-21 16:11:03 I love crushed tomatoes with some herbs, olive oil and maybe a bit of garlic. Like they have in Spain. For breakfast I love banana on toast. Usually just squash the pieces with a fork.
4184 2018-02-21 16:10:52 @SenTomCotton and @SenMajLdr are nothing more than PR reps for the NRA (and probably big oil, tobacco, etc). Pathetic.
4185 2018-02-21 16:10:49 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
4186 2018-02-21 16:10:48 It's not that the forecast catastrophe was WRONG, it's that it was MADE WRONG through effort. Peak oil is being staved off in part by consumption reductions and the huge increase in fracking, not newly discovered abundant crude reserves.
4187 2018-02-21 16:10:43 Something tells me oil money will be used to explain these concerns.
4188 2018-02-21 16:10:22 Of gas/oil.  Also worth noting there would still be demand for crude oil for other uses even electric autos really take off in the next 15 years.

4190 2018-02-21 16:10:12 Agreed. My point is that it's not about the 'evil oil companies'...we're all the problem because we all live (and continue to want to live) a lifestyle that is oil-dependent

4196 2018-02-21 16:09:34 Not sure what to do with your vegetables once you buy them? Chop them up, mix with Wegmans basting oil and throw in the oven on a baking sheet for 20-25 minutes!

4205 2018-02-21 16:09:02 Few took me seriously when I made my point at the 2015 @Transport_gc Tanker Safety Summit in Sooke. Then, 2 weeks later the the oil spill incident involving the cargo vessel MV Marathassa occurred in English Harbour.

4209 2018-02-21 16:08:42 With petro backed by some specific oil fields and not the oil already extracted, they are in fact selling futures on oil. I guess they try to bypass financial sanctions.
4210 2018-02-21 16:08:37 We ‘killed’ Standard Oil & The Bell System, maybe it’s time...
4211 2018-02-21 16:08:35 As soon as someone says “tar sands”, their level of knowledge on the subject of the oil sands can be assessed quite accurately as almost nil.
4212 2018-02-21 16:08:06 Actually, if your phone is dirty from fingerprints, you can use oil blotting sheets to clean it, bc it removes the oil from your fingers  just wanted to share this info with you
4213 2018-02-21 16:08:03 With two caveats: 
- The demand forecasts in 2018 Outlook is way higher that of BP 2017. 
- BP is the only company that is correctly talking about the "rebound effect" and that it might alter forecasts significantly toward higher oil demand that estimated.

4220 2018-02-21 16:07:05 Also, the oil is only being transported through BC. Where did you get the lie that the oil patch is coming to BC to also source oil? You're both  incorrect and ignorant.

4256 2018-02-21 16:02:05 Most of it because that is the federal transfer payments, most of it coming from Alberta so that people on the east coast can fill up their gas tanks with expensive world priced oil. You do understand how in an economy, everything is connected, right?

4263 2018-02-21 16:01:40 Coconut oil clogs your pores it’s fine for a couple months but then you’ll break out African black soap should be used in moderation it dries out a lot of peoples skin shea butter should be whipped or added to another carrier oil because of how thick it is it can clog pores

4276 2018-02-21 15:59:40 I produced a two-hour radio program and a webstream with JJ Rendon & former Oil Minister Erwin Arrieta in Feb. 2014 about Venezuelan inflation and politics. 

Back then, I calculated their annual inflation rate at 300%

Maduro's regime was officially saying 56%

4284 2018-02-21 15:59:02 My first intro to the French Press cuppa in Belgium 28 years ago. Right after enjoying my very first experience with double cooked fries in palm oil. You always remember your first.
4285 2018-02-21 15:58:47 But anyways I’ve been oil cleansing for about a month now and exfoliating at least 3 times a week and all my dry patches are gone my skin is smooth and now i have to work on my dark spots
4286 2018-02-21 15:58:34 Oh, get bent. No one believes you for a second, you snake oil salesman.
4287 2018-02-21 15:58:21 This is really good, lets hope others follow its example!
Hopefully they'll start investing in more ecologically friendly palm oil too (and do away with all these monocrops!)

4294 2018-02-21 15:57:57 Nope. BUT LET ME ASK YOU, Let's say it did.  What's the problem? Its my oil, coal, copper, etc. I live in a free capitalist society.  It's mine to sell,  right? What's your complaint *if it did get sold on the free market,  like our oil and natural gas*?

4302 2018-02-21 15:56:54 Question who puts just straight shea butter on their skin? You not gonna whip it? Add another carrier oil to it? No? You just gonna clog your pores and complain about a acne outbreak? Okay
4303 2018-02-21 15:56:53 Well, in that case... put some chopped peppers in a jar with olive oil and let the flavors infuse (this might take a few days - the longer, the stronger). Then rub a potato with the pepper oil, sprinkle it with coarse salt, wrap it in foil and bake it. Yum!!

Food for thought.

4348 2018-02-21 15:51:11 I do now - thanks! As if our production of oil eliminates our exposure to OPEC via global oil prices. Everyone keeps forgetting that oil is priced globally, no matter how much we produce.
4349 2018-02-21 15:50:56 After BP spilled millions of gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, a conservative family member of mine made a point to patronize BP gas stations to support them in the face of the boycott. It looks like conservatives have now gone past being pro oil spill to pro mass shooting.

4358 2018-02-21 15:50:11 You are right. It's much better to pay an extra $25 Billion a year to buy internationally priced oil at world prices than to have a pipeline go from Alberta to the East coast, subsidizing US oil instead. It's the Liberal Way. It doesn't have to make sense, just feel good.

4361 2018-02-21 15:49:55 @Geof_Marshall Investing in the Permian is a crowded trade. Also, profitable production will be falling there due to the parent/child well issues, cost inflation, and the API gravity of the oil produced there. Canadian energy has far more upside, we are in peak pessimism now.
4362 2018-02-21 15:49:53 That hippocrIt George Soros has made another oops. Seems that in 2017 he made substantial investment in oil related businesses.

4414 2018-02-21 15:43:08 Spills are less likely to occur from oil tankers than from other commercial vessels. Why? Because tug escorts & other stringent safety measures tend not to be imposed on non-tank vessels which, although they do not TRANSPORT oil, tend to be powered by Heavy Fuel Oil, aka Bunker C

4486 2018-02-21 15:35:31 Most obvious? AB surpassing combined ON and QC. Second most? AB setting new peaks, year after year, ON on a decades long decline. 3rd most? Oil & gas (AB), coal (everywhere) and transportation (ON & QC) are the key areas to make changes in. Am I missing something?

4497 2018-02-21 15:34:49 I'm not sure why anyone thinks Tillerson is working on behalf of America.  He's the cabinet member w/the deepest ties to Russia (and Rosneft oil money IF SANCTIONS ARE LIFTED ON ARCTIC DRILLING).  He shut down the office that handles sanctions.  I mean, c'mon people!!!

4503 2018-02-21 15:34:23 Do you mean "a fall of (net) imports"? US still needs to import lots of heavy oil (API<30) for blending (and that will increase as US light oil production increases). In fact, even ultra light (API>35) imports have increased. The fall of imports is only in the 30-35 API range.

Call them terrorists and it's Kool to rob them. 

Somalia has fish and a strategic coast . 

Call them pirates and rob them.

We're deemed "pirates" by foreigners for defending our sovereignty.  How rich
4625 2018-02-21 15:23:12 Elon Musk. Carnival Barker. Snake oil salesman. Grifter. Snake charmer. Congratulations to all who have given him money. Kiss it goodbye.

4631 2018-02-21 15:22:31 The first mistake the FGN made was to allow IOCs to be exporting oil without investing in its refineries.
4632 2018-02-21 15:22:31 Yea, the NRA should have been quicker to defend him. Might have been a good time for them to push gun safety education instead of almost a year of silence on the matter.
4633 2018-02-21 15:22:19 Plastics water bottles are made mostly from oil and natural gas, both of which is non-renewable resources. Something as scarce as water should be taken care off, such as creating alternative bottles that can easily be made from 82% renewable resources.
4634 2018-02-21 15:22:14 You right.
Peanut oil is better.
4635 2018-02-21 15:22:13 Also, 90% of SEO is snake oil.

4639 2018-02-21 15:21:55 Your declining ratings reflect what viewers think whether you like it or not.  Simply put together a track record of better reporting.  Take a lesson from your predecessors.  Make sure your facts are straight before going to air.  It’s that simple. Fix it.

4645 2018-02-21 15:21:07 We should make Congresspeople wear clothing with their top donors emblazoned on it, like sponsored athletes. We’d see a lot of guns, drugs, banks, and oil t-shirts on C-Span.

4647 2018-02-21 15:20:57 I just need one oil block and the future is settled.
4648 2018-02-21 15:20:52 I'm gonna get a pin and stick a note to my head that says "CBD oil out of stock" before I clatter someone around the place

4650 2018-02-21 15:20:41 I've used that one too and I loved it! I currently use coconut oil as well. And honestly, you're so right. It's pure magic.
4651 2018-02-21 15:20:35 read only few tweets, just love the way Looney noonio ki roohein taRap rahi hain, like a hot oil poured at them  #AwamKiZidNawazSharif
4652 2018-02-21 15:20:20 I disagree about Bernie being robbed, but that's a matter of perspective, I guess.

I haven't heard this anywhere else, it's just my observation, but it seems Russia was helping candidates who were anti-TPP: Trump, Bernie, Stein. TPP could've threatened Russian oil money.
4653 2018-02-21 15:20:19 I had high respect for @ArvindKejriwal but his stmt on Dmk or ADMK to put light on kamalhasan proved he is just another politician who draw a smaller line next to make himself look tall.. it’s another method of India to make TN inhabitable in future to dig for oil #SadButTrue

4656 2018-02-21 15:20:02 I hope she doesn't miss us too badly when we start burning oil. And did I run out of the money.
4657 2018-02-21 15:19:58 And @CNN SHAME ON  YOU FOR GIVING ANY KIND OF LEGITIMATE PLATFORM TO JACK KINGSTON AND DAVID JOLLY, FFS. REPORT ON THEIR APPALLING BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM VOMIT THEIR SNAKE OIL ON YOUR SHOW.
4658 2018-02-21 15:19:53 If the USA is soon to become an energy exporter why are they still building new pipelines to import millions of barrels of oil fuels from Canada every day?
4659 2018-02-21 15:19:49 It's complicated, but as our oil imports drop, it becomes less of an overall negative to our economy. For net exporters, high oil prices are probably good.
4660 2018-02-21 15:19:49 Whale oil beef hooked
4661 2018-02-21 15:19:49 Snake oil salesman like the rest of them.
4662 2018-02-21 15:19:48 It would be prudent for the buyer to investigate the area where they're looking to buy a home at. The facility has been around since the 1940s (as an oil field). Saying that you weren't told about it is not a valid reason imo.

4666 2018-02-21 15:19:27 Virgins?

I mean, olive oil is great.
4667 2018-02-21 15:19:26 I don't use that particular oil. But I do use a blend that at least seems to help us all concentrate.
4668 2018-02-21 15:19:19 i need to put some oil in them or some shit THEYRE THE APPLE ONES???
4669 2018-02-21 15:19:17 The party of morality, yes? I hate each and everyone of these conmen. Snake oil salesmen, the lot of them.
4670 2018-02-21 15:19:14 Pancake mix - probably has protein and fat contents added. Something from milk, egg and vegetable oil. They could oxidize or become quite stale after a while or intense (say summer) heat. 

Pancake mix isn't purely flour.

4676 2018-02-21 15:19:00 @NYCMayorsOffice will sue big oil. How about prosecuting illegals who use stolen ss# of us citizens. When names are provided no action taken. Mayor is in the same boat with criminals.
4677 2018-02-21 15:18:41 Meh, but they should have.
4678 2018-02-21 15:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.

4682 2018-02-21 15:18:03 Syria still is the only crude oil producer in the Eastern Mediterranean region. So yeah.
4683 2018-02-21 15:17:58 Tapi kejap je sya sbb lps tu kan pakai foam punya cleanser so hilang dh oil tu. Aku pun takut tapi Alhamdulillah okay pulak.
4684 2018-02-21 15:17:57 왜 이제서야 나타나신.. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
4685 2018-02-21 15:17:55 Not an agent he's part of a power triangle installed by Russian/Israeli mineral lords. Putin and Netanyahu the other two. They want total control of mineral, gas and oil. Trump has opened up land and sea to be sold off.  The Oligarchs intend to acquire it and rule world supply.
4686 2018-02-21 15:17:50 Again, car vs SUV is a much larger difference in t/km than oil sands vs other sources. And, if we're looking at t/kWh, there's another place you'll want to look.
4687 2018-02-21 15:17:47 No-the basis for illegally carrying  is he had 6grams of weed in the center console.  Its illegal to carry drugs and guns.  Unless he started using weed in the months after buying a firearm-unlikely-he lied to purchase a gun.
4688 2018-02-21 15:17:39 I want to know why the former head of Exxon is Sec.of State? We know that he made a $500 billion deal to drill for oil in Russia that's now on hold cuz of the sanctions. He's dismantling the State Dept. A weakened US presence around the world benefits who? No collusion, right?
4689 2018-02-21 15:17:32 I feel that way about fresh picked asparagus.  Grilled with some olive oil and salt/crushed pepper is bliss for me.
4690 2018-02-21 15:17:23 And for eye makeup I currently use the chamomile makeup remover from @TheBodyShop but am looking for even better/more zerowaste alternatives (I've heard coconut oil can be good for this - what isn't it good for?!)

4693 2018-02-21 15:17:09 Fuck you Koch addicts! Oil is over! It's a 19 century technology that is dirty and toxic! You made your billions. It's time to be philanthropic and try to make up for the damage you've done. #RenewableEnergy

4699 2018-02-21 15:16:53 Sitting out in the hallway for critique cause oil pain kills my lungs~ also behind cause the teacher never told me how much was due this week.
4700 2018-02-21 15:16:49 I’m not hopeful! No political leader has outlined the big money issue and how it has affected getting  #Alberta oil to a sea port ever! Today the issue is Kinder Morgan ( supplying Washington and B.C.) not #Gateway seaport or the Pipeline to the east coast.

4703 2018-02-21 15:16:46 I was giving it to her but then ran out and never got more (usually too fixated on keeping her allergy meds filled, haha). She gets fish oil and the omega threes are supposed to help, too. I honestly think the humidity got the best of her today.

4711 2018-02-21 15:14:54 Wow, we think skid loader blew a big one going to the oil cooler yesterday. I can't see it though so it had to get towed in. Had to pitch bucket of manure back out

4713 2018-02-21 15:14:48 Think more?  Answer the question:  do you believe a cop should wait to be shot and killed before defending himself or should a cop be able to shoot after someone claims to be armed and reaches after being told not to?
4714 2018-02-21 15:14:40 By that time, will the oil business still be profitable?

4737 2018-02-21 15:12:23 Both Trump and Tillerson want in on the Russian oil deal. It's partly why they want us to remain addicted to oil and won't support alternative energy.

4746 2018-02-21 15:11:00 So your basis for thinking he was illegally carrying is that he may have lied about smoking weed on the forms? Even if he had a legal carry permit?

4754 2018-02-21 15:09:50 All the points about coconut oil being a stupid choice for lube are entirely valid. Why would you *want* to use it as lube in the first place? It has plenty of uses; it isn't poisonous. It's just a rubbish choice for lube.

The best we do is mine & sell the mineral off @ cheap rates & later buy d off shoot products exorbitantly
4764 2018-02-21 15:09:00 The fact that the cop didn’t know he was illegally carrying is only a moot point for justifying the shooting-which I never tried to do based on illegal carry.  Its completely relevant to whether the NRA should defend Castille.
4765 2018-02-21 15:08:49 Think I've seriously got every power piece of equipment broke now. 3010 bad pto sounds, 1490 broken pto cable, 2594 still needs checked after blowing oil out and some minor leaks, skid loader blew another hose that I can't get to.

4769 2018-02-21 15:08:07 Got an awesome trial/debate going on about continued use of oil in the middle east. Jenna Nelson just uttered the phrase "Do you need a mask for the atmosphere?" #WPHSproud

4777 2018-02-21 15:07:38 And again, why tell a cop you have a gun and then brandish it? Why kill someone instead of using a taser? Why not have more training for situations like that, so less people get killed? Think more, scream less
4778 2018-02-21 15:07:32 Careful James!! Now go oil your rusty shoulder... (that’s a joke @Twitter)
4779 2018-02-21 15:07:32 Thanks! Apparently this happens pretty often there. The staff were really great about it, though! Maybe you could roll up an oil tanker full of the stuff?  (Send it to my place afterwards.)
4780 2018-02-21 15:07:30 The climate for this problem was and is created by Liberal leftists in Canada that are suppressing oil and gas pipelines to tide-water
4781 2018-02-21 15:07:28 Its illegal to carry a gun and drugs. Infact the form you have to fill out for backgroumd check to purchase a firearm asks you if you use weed (11e) so not only was he illegally carrying a firearm-he probably lied on the forms to purchase the handgun.

4833 2018-02-21 15:03:05 I haven’t seen where he was illegally carrying. And even so, the cop didn’t know if he was carrying legally or not, so anger moot point. You’re on a roll.
4834 2018-02-21 15:03:00 Try oil yg light weighted. Mybe argan oil, or rosehip. Banyak lagi. Lps tu make sure kita put on sufficient amount. Not too much and not too less. Sbb kita mcm train kulit kita utk depends kt oil to protect the moisture barrier.

4839 2018-02-21 15:02:08 The International Energy Agency noted that improved efficiency of U.S. shale oil and gas production increased U.S. crude oil and natural gas production, which could soon make U.S. production number one in the world. This increase in supply should moderate energy price increases.

4897 2018-02-21 14:56:53 Sorry, he sold snake oil and made himself wealthy doing so. $25 million personal net worth. Not to mention his association, which including carryover and profits from investments, finished the year with $284.52 million in assets. So no, this is not "America's Pastor."

4901 2018-02-21 14:56:42 Agreed. I think it’s a troll account. To claim that “the region” that didn’t even exist in 1987, was producing oil then, is offensive to the people who fought Saddam and were killed by Saddam. Kurds were forced to the mountains and didn’t  control any city’s yet any oilfields

4906 2018-02-21 14:55:55 It's currently going on in Venezuela, and there is CIA involvement throughout the region.

The CIA in Venezuela is basically acting as a goon squad fro Chevron because they are upset Chavez wouldn't let them exploit their oil reserves.
4907 2018-02-21 14:55:52 Does anyone on here have good buyers of crude oil? We at M. Aghaisuotti Ltd, Nigeria, could facilitate for the sale of Nigeria's Bonny Light Crude Oil, which is world's most sought-after light crude oil grade.
Thanks.

4926 2018-02-21 14:53:54 I remember reading in the 80's then My Fathers friend who reset the burning  Kuwait oil  after 1991 Gulf War  mentioned that Saudi oil would run out in 2050...
Huge amounts of oil still left.

4937 2018-02-21 14:52:58 The way @VWGroup builds there engine is difficult for its owners and mechanics to fix or work on some issues on there cars. Eg, Gear oil, cooling fan for the radiator, etc. you have to lose almost everything.  Please @Volkswagen check this issues on manufacturing

If anything I may have hurt the popularity of Tech N9ne.

4961 2018-02-21 14:50:12 i actually have been talking to a local co interested in using me to determine if pipelines will get built in NE USA, and if mafia will try to unload oil trucking biz before that happens: mobsters have to exit heating oil biz before pipelines built.
4962 2018-02-21 14:50:09 Pro tip from one oily bitch to another: CHANGE. YOUR. PILLOWCASES. I try to do it every few days but once a week is fine. Your face is smushed against it for hours every night and without changing pillowcases often it soaks up dirt/sweat/oil. It makes a big difference yall

5047 2018-02-21 14:41:49 They got Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe islands, we got oil, then they act like they got the short-stick?
5048 2018-02-21 14:41:41 Beard oil, beard oil, beard oil. Esp for black men and our joyfully sometimes unruly locks... any suggestions? Atm coconut oil is doing the job but I'm sure there's better options...

5052 2018-02-21 14:41:04 And EU/US wants a Saudi/Qatari gas pipeline
And Israel just wants the oil and the land
etc. 
No one has asked what the Syrians want.
5053 2018-02-21 14:41:00 Oil isn't going away, but Gulf countries moving heavily into solar. Last week Oman kicked off phase 1 of new 1GW plant JV with Shell. Benefit is freeing up gas for export.
5054 2018-02-21 14:40:58 And don’t they always show you a dirty air filter that absolutely NEEDS to be replaced?  Eric once went in for an oil change and a few hundred bucks later.....
5055 2018-02-21 14:40:51 What a lying manipulative tweet. American, gun lobbyists, pharmaceutical lobbyists, health insurance lobbyists, corporate lobbyists, oil company lobbyists, those are the threats to American democracy. The middle class has been sold out, by The Republican Party for donor money!
5056 2018-02-21 14:40:39 Once a upon a time, a oil sellers wife saved a spoonful of oil daily fr husband’s jar, when winter came, there was nothing left 2sell.  She took out saved oil- smart!The neighbor was a calendar seller, his wife mimicked same tactic &by the end of the year, she also saved a stack.

5072 2018-02-21 14:38:41 Much respect Mr Cleese, but our own involvement in Syria (recognising rebel’s as the ‘sole legitimate authority’ in 2012) is hardly born out of selflessness. It’s a grab for an oil pipeline route, and as a destabilising proxy force for Saudi regional power vs Iran.

5078 2018-02-21 14:37:59 Genuinely socialist policies in Scandinavia were effectively stopped in the early 1990s due to the decline of the Scandinavian economies and they have since reversed them. Norway is the most resistant but its economy is propped up by oil.
5079 2018-02-21 14:37:50 I think like our Power Sector, Our Oil Sector have been bewitched by a 7 Headed demon...or how do U explain this perennial problem; it's either the people managing this sector are completely decerebrate & myopic by nature or the problem is a Spiritual one

It's virtually impossible to maintain semblance of "civilization" and respect for Law, when you tolerate moral aberrations & wink-&-nod attitude toward drug-abuse! Try mixing oil & water!

5091 2018-02-21 14:36:37 It's a big market thing. We're contributing Thai curry, Spanish chickpea stew and vegan aubergine parmegiana at our stall, a vegan bar menu and then that orange and olive oil cake too.
5092 2018-02-21 14:36:35 Poulin has looked much calmer in net. Scrivens still playing similar to his NHL days, way too much movement. Which is odd for a guy who’s played on the big ice this season.

5095 2018-02-21 14:36:18 High marks to James Woolsey, urging President Trump to ignore direct sanctions against Russia in favor of destabilizing the world price of oil hurting them indirectly, harming many nations who have nothing to do with it.  Like lobbing a grenade into a room of hostages.  Well done
5096 2018-02-21 14:36:17 OIL the WHALES have it, have a nice swim higher  UWT ???
5097 2018-02-21 14:36:05 Hi John.  Sincere question: if Trump is Russian puppet or agent, can you explain the missiles to the Ukraine and the drive for US to dominate oil market, both hurtful to Putin and Russia.

Thx
5098 2018-02-21 14:35:33 Couldn't this entangle Trump, Tillerson, Flynn and Manafort? Weren't they all involved in a big oil and gas deal together? My understanding was that Putin's cut would've been around $500million, or was it billion.
5099 2018-02-21 14:35:27 How?  We can’t stop burning oil overnight, the economy would collapse.
5100 2018-02-21 14:35:11 What are guys running for oil in there tractors and combines? We are currently running a Full synthetic up to 450 - 500. Thinking about running same hours but with a blended product.

5107 2018-02-21 14:34:28 so true, I'm almost convinced that they could be an oil baron 
5108 2018-02-21 14:34:25 It's such bullshit. I see all the time my cousins post "sign up and get a $500 bonus". It doesn't work like that. "This kept cofee is amazing and there's nothing else like it"... its essentially just as ketogenic as instant coffee with coconut oil in it.. I hate it.

5113 2018-02-21 14:34:02 Green NGOs get their funding from government, corporations (including oil companies!) and uber-wealthy 'philanthopists'. They have an endless flow of cash, and would overwhelm any crowdfunding. A bit like anti-windfarm campaigners vs massive energy companies.
5114 2018-02-21 14:33:53 TBH, I'm not a fan of "rebranding" - it's disingenuous, and smacks of deceit. I view a PST as the "cod liver oil" that Alberta needs to take - no matter how awful it tastes.

5121 2018-02-21 14:32:33 I found a black owned reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner at Target. The shampoo is coconut and the conditioner is tea tree oil and so is the oil spray. It’s all $9.00 a bottle and it works really well.

5127 2018-02-21 14:31:17 Uptake on some of this shit is mind-bogglingly long. It sucks sucks sucks. And some of it puts you at real risk during the uptake, before it works. Maybe CBD oil? It helps level me out. Sleep comes easier, too. 

Meanwhile, keep talking. DM, if you need to, want to, or whatever.
5128 2018-02-21 14:31:14 Kenya for your information is not helping Sudan, it's looting oil and other valuables, who told yet Sudanese would not rule themselves?
5129 2018-02-21 14:31:12 Because patients cannot wait for MPs to decide when #MedicalCannabis will be available on prescription, #patients are setting up #cannabiscollectives and sharing the cost to grow. #caregivers grow for those that cant and help provide access to oil. #cannabissocialclubs #mmj #pot
5130 2018-02-21 14:31:11 Can we agree that some kind of oil helps in some cases and not in others and just be co-workers again

Please give me money!
5134 2018-02-21 14:30:46 El problema es la ecuación general, o sea todos los precios de los combustibles incluyendo nafta y gas oil impactan en forma sustancial en todos los precios de la economia y estan muchísimo mas altos q los PPI respectivos. Esto hace q los costos de producción sean muy caros.
5135 2018-02-21 14:30:43 OIL DIFF: 3.63 -> 3.65
5136 2018-02-21 14:30:38 Agreed.....but when you consider that the Nigerian federation’s total oil income for 2017 was closer to $8B than $9B then spending $5.8B on fuel imports for 3-4 months screams corruption. This goes beyond just subsidy, they are inflating the demand....that’s an issue.
5137 2018-02-21 14:30:33 A light was bobbing closer down the hall and I wanted to scream and I wanted to run away because Miss Farrady…Miss Farrady was coming with that oil and that lamp to light me on fire and watch me burn burn burn

Cannabis oil. 
Plants heal, Merck will kill ya in a heartbeat.
5141 2018-02-21 14:30:14 1/2#SouthSudan the problem is that the information available is scandy. But we can not deny that greater forces are involved. The fear from the super powers is too much,they fear that South Sudan can become too strong for them to handle if it starts to get its own barrels of oil.

5145 2018-02-21 14:29:48 could a late cycle fiscal expansion that widens the current account for any given rate differential provide a loose // to the impact of higher oil prices from 04-07?  thinking out loud here  ... 

implication of course is that rate differential has to widen to pull in funds
5146 2018-02-21 14:29:21 you don't approve of detoxes and essential oils. this is heresy. why just the other day i saw a patient who used lavender oil when she had the flu. a week later she was up and about and feeling better. QED.

5151 2018-02-21 14:28:53 Had a dream last night where I was interviewing a woman on the north slope of AK about more oil companies arriving there. She replied "It's just more engineers & restaurants!"

"More Engineers & Restaurants" needs to be book title. Or a poem title. Or a band name. #DreamsAreWeird
5152 2018-02-21 14:28:52 Don’t honor this disgraceful snake oil salesman.
5153 2018-02-21 14:28:42 “the Trump administration has made life harder for Russia diplomatically and economically thanks to revving up our oil and gas production”? THAT’S your answer? I spent the 1980s learning how to knock the wheels off of BTR60s...THAT puts my sacrifice in perspective.
5154 2018-02-21 14:28:39 Jonah - his reply is not what she tweeted or implied. Are you a Russian bot?
5155 2018-02-21 14:28:22 Drop my car off to get my brakes done, I’m on my way to work and I get a call: your oil pan is dented and you need a new one for $860. Uhm, I think the fuck not. That oil pan will remain dented for now since its not leaking.
5156 2018-02-21 14:28:18 Speaking of which, Venezuela just announced their Petrol coin backed by barrels of oil. An alternative form of money to circumvent their sovereign debt.  Watch closely folks because this could be a model for any country that defaults.

5165 2018-02-21 14:27:15 Big oil needs to actually care for the environment rather than just say they do. The system should be setup such that they would. Right now, it greatly rewards undesirable company behaviour. We shouldn't need activists (but we do), unbiased science should rule the behaviour.

5177 2018-02-21 14:25:40 I sure you can figure out how to rub food grade mineral oil on it.
5178 2018-02-21 14:25:39 And bear in mind, this is the share of coverage Trump was given AS POLLS SHOWED THRU OUT THAT MOST AMERICANS SUPPORTED HILLARY.

So when they hide behind phony claims of "impartiality" for seeking out Nazis, misogynists, & oil industry apologists & excluding the majority, call BS
5179 2018-02-21 14:25:31 They really be asking us to rub coconut oil on ppl.

5185 2018-02-21 14:24:21 How much is Brent crude oil since we getting 52cents fuel levy?
5186 2018-02-21 14:24:01 And I should care? To me B G always typified the Southern preacher selling snake oil.
5187 2018-02-21 14:23:54 Lots of water or Gatorade. Maybe rub peppermint oil on your head and neck.
5188 2018-02-21 14:23:46 just get coconut oil and 2 daps of tea tree oil and massage it in it’ll start growing
5189 2018-02-21 14:23:36 I totally agree with you Facts are Stubborn things but how about the following stubborn facts,Inconsistent Power Supply, Petrol Scarcity in a country that has oil as Natural resource,Bad Dangerous roads all over Nigeria, Starvation, Unemployment,Stagnant economy,etc etc
5190 2018-02-21 14:23:35 @lbc I know someone who had eye cancer which spread to his liver and was giving a very poor prognosis.  He takes cannabis oil and his tumour has shrunk - the doctors can't believe it!

5192 2018-02-21 14:23:30 why iran and not saudi arabia? that saudis financed al qaeda and isis, the iranians are, as shia, anti-wahabbist, against isis, against al qaeda, where as we are allied with the saudis for their oil. don't buy that easily into propaganda.
5193 2018-02-21 14:23:27 大杉漣さんの訃報の内容を見て、ちょっと去年のことを思い出していた。
5194 2018-02-21 14:23:27 なるほどね
5195 2018-02-21 14:23:26 Have you a tried tea tree oil mixture?
5196 2018-02-21 14:23:22 i put coconut oil in my hair and it did nothing but make me feel like a greasy swamp monster; local twitter has betrayed me for the last time
5197 2018-02-21 14:23:18 He will be missed by many people who love snake oil salesmen spouting about Jesus.
5198 2018-02-21 14:23:06 You really don't need to do so. He typified the Southern preacher selling snake oil.

5200 2018-02-21 14:22:40 Animal agriculture is so wealthy and powerful, in the same league as big pharma and the oil companies, that it will not allow governments to recommend a fully plant based diet. It would fight that to the very end for obvious reasons.
5201 2018-02-21 14:22:33 Kudos to Team Canada men's squad...expectations have been met. For this group, getting to the medal round should've been the goal...anything else is gravy.
5202 2018-02-21 14:22:20 Never could stand the man; to me he exemplified the Southern preacher selling snake oil.
5203 2018-02-21 14:22:15 Wasn’t it a cooking oil too?

5206 2018-02-21 14:21:56 Many individuals have made and used their own hemp oil successfully for many ailments( particularly Canada & Nova Scotia, see internet), but big Pharma stops things getting taken to the next legal step as they have a vested interest in selling useless drugs.

5212 2018-02-21 14:21:20 I think SA has used its oil resources to strike an alliance with the USA increasing its power...w/out that alliance not sure how threatened the Iranians would feel.  #video0109a

5221 2018-02-21 14:19:46 Again shows how oil engulfed everything
5222 2018-02-21 14:19:42 Yeah those are generally better and that’s def included here. I was thinking more of oil related stuff when I tweeted it but certainly also applies to when they use those laws against animal rights groups.
5223 2018-02-21 14:19:29 They can finally get the pipe to the Indian Ocean, something they have been fighting about since the oil industry was born. Trump is so helpful to Putty Put

5230 2018-02-21 14:18:42 Unfortunately, that's Midland and Odessa in a nutshell right now. They cater to the oil field workers and if you aren't apart of that industry they could care less for you.

5235 2018-02-21 14:18:24 it's just that less than a month passed from the oil field claim off cyprus being made to the attack on what may otherwise have been a legitimate military objective.

5238 2018-02-21 14:17:48 @QuornFoods there is no such thing as ethical / responsibly sourced palm oil! Shame on you Quorn. Why do some of your products use sunflower oil & others palm? Why can't you stop using it all together???

5240 2018-02-21 14:17:20 I mean with the economy stalling, there's not much been additional tax mop up,but for increase in excise on oil. The savings on Aadhar/scams have been close to offset by additional outgoes & some self-goals by the govt. 
Where's the money for huge capital spend?
5241 2018-02-21 14:17:03 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

5246 2018-02-21 14:16:35 Why would anyone want to?

Chevron, an energy company heavily invested in fossil fuels has begin to turn down production on oil and increase production in renewables. Energy is energy and the kids will be asking for the latest developments.

5256 2018-02-21 14:15:32 Pretty much .. .. just depends on the potency of the oil .
5257 2018-02-21 14:15:26 Actually, the chart shows the USD rallying (slightly) once the 2y spread went positive until about the peak in the spread in '06. Rather than oil I'd suggest as a root cause super-abundant financial liquidity resulting from the discovery of safe-asset alchemy (or so we thought)

5269 2018-02-21 14:14:08 Hi Chris, while we have seen a few birds that have been exposed to oil, the exposure has happened off site, and they have then flown into the nature reserve. We can confirm that we have not seen any sign of oil pollution within Walthamstow Wetlands, other than on these few birds.
5270 2018-02-21 14:14:07 Yeah...if that were the case fine but not so much. With far too many fans it's all about "physicality and effort"

5277 2018-02-21 14:13:14 In the battle for oil supremacy, the spoils will go to the U.S., according to BP Plc’s 2018 Energy Outlook. The U.S., driven by the growth of shale, will see its share of world liquids supply peak at 21 percent in 2035. That’s almost double the level of arch-rival Saudi Arabia.

5301 2018-02-21 14:10:34 Norway did it. Why didn't Alberta maintain taxes and oil royalties and diversify its economy at the height of the oil boom?

5322 2018-02-21 14:07:54 Be fair: Heavy AB oil is discounted for many reasons. Access to transport is just 1.

5328 2018-02-21 14:06:22 It depends on what one defines as oil. Some agencies include plastics feedstocks such as ethane as “oil”. We are seeing much more NGL production due to improved volume and efficient use of processing plants, while crude oil and “real” condensate are barely growing.

Hello Oil country! 
I'm still looking for a job 
5462 2018-02-21 13:52:39 On what basis are they flawed? No one has pointed out any *factual* problems with the forecasts, just some nonsense about “secret new models”.
Which idiots are buying the snake oil you’re selling??

5469 2018-02-21 13:51:25 Are they in snake oil sales or are they deluded enough to believe the nonsense they come out with? I'm not sure but I'm sure there's psychology research on the distortions and deflections that allow highly ideological individuals to maintain their worldview, against all evidence.
5470 2018-02-21 13:51:16 They jerk off to guns n ammo...they dont watch porn..they watch youtube vids of guys rubbing guns with baby oil...
5471 2018-02-21 13:51:12 I’ve heard of clove oil being used. I’m gonna try it soon if this doesn’t get better soon. My issue is that I don’t have time to get them out because my life is so hectic and busy right now 

Thank you so much!!!

5497 2018-02-21 13:47:29 Particularly, I recall the whitepaper says it doesn't offer oil, it offers bolivars based on the oil price. On top of risk of total default, this gives them opportunity to do a partial default by manipulating the official bolivar rate, which they have a history of doing.

5503 2018-02-21 13:47:01 Smartass. You're part of climate change. Main reason for oil is for gas, gas burns to  power cars, burning creates climate change. Go back to horses. Wait horses create methane. Go back to walking. We create methane. Guess we should shoot ourselves(DON'T). Wait they took the guns
5504 2018-02-21 13:46:54 America is such dumb country. Only good for two things, oil and films
5505 2018-02-21 13:46:45 If we where completely renewable, the price of oil would be irrelevant. That would seem it be in itself a great blessing.

5537 2018-02-21 13:42:15 about 54% of canada's (imported) oil comes from u.s not 54% of oil consumed there is a difference. secondly you still didnt answer how that oil gets here since you are so concerned about a spill.

5603 2018-02-21 13:32:12 another easy one: white fish that you 'marinate' in salt and haldi. lightly fry and set aside. in mustard (or any oil), add lots of chopped onions, ginger, green chilies, chopped tomato and finally, fish and coriander. the chopped-ness gives it diff texture from 'bata/paste'.
5604 2018-02-21 13:32:10 Sampe sekarang masih gak ngerti bedanya virgin olive oil sama extra virgin itu apaan..
5605 2018-02-21 13:31:58 Yep. Not sure what to make of Gase. Squeaky wheels usually get the oil, except in Miami where they get the boot. While a trade is possible, a number of things will have to fall perfectly in place.
5606 2018-02-21 13:31:44 Yup! I,d switch up the water for oil instead lol

5610 2018-02-21 13:31:15 Oh so it was kind of like a message board then? Unfortunately, any place where multiple people hang out on the internet usually turn into something less than desirable.  I'm a member of a forum dedicated(mostly) to discussions about motor oil.
5611 2018-02-21 13:31:12 Nope, Ofada is in the 'rice and stew' category. Native rice is a palm oil based rice made with dried fish and cray fish. Yum Yum
5612 2018-02-21 13:31:08 You use cooking oil as mouth wash

5614 2018-02-21 13:30:55 The pain clinic is teamed up with a place in Wilmington called The Hemp Pharmacy, and that’s who supplies them with the CBD oil. It’s not covered by insurance, obviously, but the PA said it really worked for other patients with chronic pain
5615 2018-02-21 13:30:55 Deception is the perfect word  .... but liar , cheat , con artist , snake oil salesman , bull shitter , smooozer ,  ...... wait...... he is a Liberal  ....that's about all that needs to be said
5616 2018-02-21 13:30:55 Then why is that millions of rounds of ammunition are fired from millions of gun across the U.S. & yet only a small fraction of those kill people? & a small fraction of that # are killed are because someone fired it with the intent to kill. Blame the Person not the Tool

5618 2018-02-21 13:30:49 I feel NLers do not like those of us who left at a early age for a career and have now returned upon retirement.  Our ideas are discounted while those of a snake oil salesman for the mainland are embraced with open arms.  We who left and now are back have learned lots #nlpoli

5620 2018-02-21 13:30:37 (HLH diary) February 21: “Worked all morning and half of the afternoon with Tim, on the car, trying to stop a leak in the oil system. Succeeded to some extent.” (1/2)

5626 2018-02-21 13:30:06 I would write about it as if it were a fancy bond issue, that claims to be backed by an as-yet-untapped oil reserve. Doing it **ON THE BLOCKCHAIN** is just the marketing
5627 2018-02-21 13:30:03 Another problem to address is that usually you need a trusted entity to whistleblow to. If someone in the government agency for enforcement was in the pocket of the oil/gas company and knows who you are, then you can get compromised that way.
5628 2018-02-21 13:29:58 When oil is in water, It floats. That's how we've always been and will always be. I don't even wanna be the kool-aid to your water

5649 2018-02-21 13:26:20 It’s said to only use a few drops of jojoba oil but, wow, I’m definitely guilty of bathing my entire existence in it. Especially after a shave, I feel luxurious.
5650 2018-02-21 13:26:19 Ha, hey at least they are backed by oil (and I’m sure the Venezuela gov’t has it properly pegged and on the up and up )
5651 2018-02-21 13:26:12 Too much oil on the legs.
5652 2018-02-21 13:26:07 Russians depend on oil. If America floods the system with our oil. Russia will suffer more than anything else .. And will ..send a much stronger messege than a sanction. However. It will also help increase  carbons in the world. Either way we "Rock the Boat".

5659 2018-02-21 13:25:39 Coat the fish pieces in turmeric and salt and fry in vegetable oil. Set aside. Then, add less than a quarter teaspoon of onion seeds to that oil, as soon as it splutters, add your mustard paste (about two tablespoon). Add green chillis if you have. Stir till the oil separates

5662 2018-02-21 13:25:16 Record indirect taxes. And that a consequence of mega increase in excise on oil at low international crude prices. 
Also,Low credit offtake due to banking crisis & economy boost dependant on Public investment & consumption doesn't reflect a booming economy right?

5667 2018-02-21 13:24:47 Already done by the Cameroonian State, even if the motivation is supported by debt collection after massive loss in custom incomes. Wood is reported to represent the second export earnings... after oil that is never mentioned in the budget law. #FightForGombo .

5672 2018-02-21 13:24:12 Trump surrogates like @JackKingston have sold their country down the river for a snake oil salesman. Whataboutism & deflection are straight out of the Putin playbook.

5673 2018-02-21 13:24:11 Oooh that’s interesting!!! So it’s probably primarily sunflower oil??
5674 2018-02-21 13:23:54 Another reason Iran's oil and gas sector is badly in need of investment in the post-sanctions era: Today, #Iran is wasting approx 1.2m bls of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in energy due to ongoing inefficiencies - Sec of Iran Chamber of Commerce Narsi Ghorban. #oott #IPWeek
5675 2018-02-21 13:23:48 I get angry when I see a mamaguevito that has not sounded and does not have a single seat and that has more oil than Donald Trump 
5676 2018-02-21 13:23:43 Here is one of those who traded crude oil for weapons and equipment with the beards of ISIS, how many millions of dollars has thus pocketed the Erdogan family with these traffics made without the knowledge of the Syrians who were thus stolen and looted?
5677 2018-02-21 13:23:32 That's the first time I've seen "self-evident" spelled "offensive".
5678 2018-02-21 13:23:28 Oil Change at 8 this morning 
5679 2018-02-21 13:23:27 I've heard in Oil/Gas towns, the copy shops and internet cafe are in the pocket of the company. So just using them may finger you. Hell, just leaving the area where every activity isn't monitored might be enough to finger a whistleblower. They don't need proof, only suspicion.
5680 2018-02-21 13:23:16 I put an essential oil spray on my pilllow that’s supposed to produce vivid dreams & dreamed I was being forced to watch someone executed by lethal injection while I was mocked for crying so......brain please chill
5681 2018-02-21 13:23:09 PRO TIP:
If you’re going to make that rose oil that I suggested yesterday,,,, DO NOT USE COCONUT OIL. That shit gardens and whenever you want to use the oil you have to warm it up, instead use grape seed oil or olive oil.  #trialandfuckingerror
5682 2018-02-21 13:23:05 Isn't this a fallacy?  No one's claiming they're experts, so why does he feel compelled to declare that they're not?  

It's like saying "I'm here to tell you motor oil is not safe to drink".
5683 2018-02-21 13:22:58 Lo del rendimiento de los pozos es una realidad que compensan abriendo uno nuevo y acrecentando la potencia de las macollas. Por supuesto que requiere gran apoyo financiero. Ello, sin embargo, se va compensar con la entrada de las Big Oil en estas cuencas dw tight oil

5689 2018-02-21 13:22:09 It's beyond offensive that these Democrat Party operatives disguised as journalists continue to lie about who and what they really are.
5690 2018-02-21 13:21:24 I’m confused as to why anyone would think that Russian agents would follow conservatives who are for stronger defense, less national debt, oil and energy independence, etc. Liberals and msm script has brainwashed public opinion to believe this w/o consideration or common sense.
5691 2018-02-21 13:21:20 probably. mustard oil has not as yet been mainstreamed. we need some vegans or hipsters to discover it ;)

5711 2018-02-21 13:18:11 Why would we expect any other than more from the oil this season.  Average performance all season long.  What is upsetting to me is they have no heart.  Maybe the fans should have no heart and stop supporting such an average team and average effort night after night
5712 2018-02-21 13:18:00 She probably uses coconut oil on her face
5713 2018-02-21 13:17:52 Remember the US laundered Venezuelan oil through the USVI for years to fuel your cars & more too! Doing business with the "enemy."

5716 2018-02-21 13:17:11 Ah, you're missing out the word 'credible'. A fiscal plan that relied on oil as a basis (despite Salmond's assertion that it was only a 'bonus'). And no credible currency plan either.
5717 2018-02-21 13:16:56 Those academics on ZHC are not in the scheme anyway. The USS invests in arms manufacturers, tobacco companies and oil and mining developers. Can't left-wing academics not do any better?

5738 2018-02-21 13:13:01 Without a polar ice cap there will be no danger of an oil tanker hitting an iceberg up there. #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

5742 2018-02-21 13:12:28 Land with oil deposits should be accompanied by certified geological reports for prove.

5747 2018-02-21 13:11:59 Getting an oil change at one of those speedy oil change places. I always enjoy the earnestness of the youngster who comes to show me the dipstick and talk all purplemonkeydishwasher at me about automotive fluids.
5748 2018-02-21 13:11:54 Vitamin E oil is wonderful for dry chapped lips. Use in place of a chap stick or lip balm.
5749 2018-02-21 13:11:53 NEWS: Oil Spill on River Lee. We watched the report on @itvnews last night. The @CanalRiverTrust is looking for the source & has closed the Lee to prevent the spill from entering the Thames. Residents & boat owners are using what they can to create barriers & absorb the spill

5751 2018-02-21 13:11:42 Everything I knew is leaving (old oil), and I'm getting all this new stuff (new oil).
5752 2018-02-21 13:11:28 My hair goes through phases, my last attempt is Cantu the Argan oil leave in. 

If this doesn’t do me right, I’m going back to my wig life until I return. Bcos fr, I’ve had enough 

Stay tuned...
5753 2018-02-21 13:11:27 Work on a ship, drilling through for oil in suction, an ignition fails and blows up most of the lower deck. We start repairs. The ship is hollow with a lot of industrial parts

5758 2018-02-21 13:10:28 You make electric cars which are threatening the oil industry (and car industry for that matter) you know what that means for this administration right?
5759 2018-02-21 13:10:24 The #ABNDP of Alberta will call a election, and then the APC will win, cancel all carbon initatives, then make B.C. hurt. There is nothing left for the oil and gas industry in BC after a goverment breaks a deal.

5763 2018-02-21 13:10:04 It's the vegetable oil aftertaste I can't bear. More sugar, less cocoa, kinda like Hersheys. Funny that. All the while swearing up and down that they haven't changed the recipe. Even my kids taste the difference so it's not just advancing decrepitude. Sigh.

#Scotland will call #indyref2 + will leave this unequal union 
When we take all our scottish produce + oil back, where will the #UK be?
5765 2018-02-21 13:09:21 the THC helps in this case. The CBD oil sold in the the UK is different from what is sold in the states. (chemistry is crazy!)
5766 2018-02-21 13:09:10 The highlight of my day today is getting my oil changed
5767 2018-02-21 13:09:03 If there ever was a real life embodiment of the snake oil salesman.
5768 2018-02-21 13:08:59 I will pour boiling olive oil directly onto the skull of an incel virgin
5769 2018-02-21 13:08:17 I swear, sometimes I complain about my employer but it has it perks around the city at times. Guy at Honda asked if I had a coupon for my oil change, I told him no. He said well that jacket is your coupon because you take care of the little ones....15.00 off. Thank ya! 
5770 2018-02-21 13:08:09 How about go back to Oil Money?  I don't know... NRA has it's place but not politics.
5771 2018-02-21 13:07:46 Can I do that with CBD oil?
5772 2018-02-21 13:07:31 Maldives has no oil!
5773 2018-02-21 13:07:24 Incompatible with western society. When will the PC politicians realise oil and water don't mix?
5774 2018-02-21 13:07:24 "0.75 per cent of GDP"..which means that GDP in BC., Alberta are based on oil and nothing else..is this the way to run a country?

5776 2018-02-21 13:06:30 It’s just a wee garage, I know the old guy and he gets what he can from the scrappy to keep the price down. He’ll never be rich but he’s always busy! I just didn’t want to go to him if it was something stupid after the last time when I thought I had an oil leak 
5777 2018-02-21 13:06:13 yeah but what if they team up with oil can harry and swifty and they kill mighty mouse and from then on it's the new adventures of heckle & jeckle & quacula

5783 2018-02-21 13:05:11 I’m confused as to why anyone would think that Russian agents would follow conservatives who are for stronger defense, less national debt, oil and energy independence, etc. Liberals and msm script has brainwashed public opinion to believe this w/o consideration or common sense.

5810 2018-02-21 13:01:34 @theJeremyVine it’s about time people stop denying the actual facts of the benefits of cannabis oil! It IS a medicine!! It should be legal to buy ANYWHERE in the world!! Stop denying good health!

- Brent ave through to 2023 $50-70bbl…
5812 2018-02-21 13:01:31 2017 was quite an interesting year. As the news cycle has been dominated by politics, natural disasters, and tense geopolitical challenges; also, the oil market is still challenged by high stocks and sluggish prices. #upstreamsummit2018

5830 2018-02-21 12:56:59 I’m surprised @JustinTrudeau  like @Kathleen_Wynne  we’re not paying the states to take our oil as @Kathleen_Wynne is doing with our Hydro. Come on people are we going to give up everything before we vote @Kathleen_Wynne out in June & @JustinTrudeau in 2019
5831 2018-02-21 12:56:43 risky business 
POWER PLAY: Syria just gave Russia EXCLUSIVE rights to produce oil and gas
In the final ignominy of the West’s epic failure to depose Assad, they’ve not only lost the war – they’ve lost Syria’s resources
5832 2018-02-21 12:56:43 I'd love to see the fools arguing against legalizing Cannabis Oil state their case to the faces of the parents of children who suffer countless fits/seizures a day that could be ceased by it's use.

5835 2018-02-21 12:56:09 You would only see 1p at UKOG if it was a complete duster with no plan B...

UKOG is not a one trick pony...

5839 2018-02-21 12:55:46 Looking at the Oil and Gas focus of this, you also have to consider that if only a few people have access to sensitive information, a whistleblower may be traced by process of elimination regardless of the tech. A truly secure disclosure points fingers right at the tech savvy.

5858 2018-02-21 12:52:42 BBC radio 2 talking about cannabis oil and a serious matter about a child with seizures and how cannabis oil helped reduce them and the first tune they play after the topic is a reggae tune
5859 2018-02-21 12:52:28 Because foreign oil companies like Soma Oil and Gas want to exploit it and give the remaining share to their puppets like Somalia's PM.
5860 2018-02-21 12:51:45 All we get is "hope!" or "we'll do things differently!" but no actual fiscal plan. The only one in 2014 relied on a consistent revenue from oil taxation (which Salmond pretended was a 'bonus'), and we all know what's happened to that.
5861 2018-02-21 12:51:40 Never going back here for an oil change again. 2 months to resolve a complaint which hasn’t even been resolved yet. Smh

5877 2018-02-21 12:49:39 #jeremyvine it's all down to the money! Natural or drugs sold  by the wealthy lining there own pockets rather then the health and safety of the many.
Cannabis oil has been tested and the results seem better in the long term rather then the drugs being sold.

5889 2018-02-21 12:48:36 I really feel like no beard oil is good for anybody bc it fills tf out of your pores and literally creates more ingrowns and bumps. Tea tree might be the best but still

5897 2018-02-21 12:47:45 yeah, i'll pass. This sounds like snake oil to me. If you love it enjoy i guess.
5898 2018-02-21 12:47:40 All sin involves deception. It’s the disguising of evil as good. There is a superficial attraction, ‘the lips of an adulteress drip honey, & her speech is smoother than oil’.

5908 2018-02-21 12:46:15 Baby oil helps. See, powder just dries and dries up fast as you walk.
5909 2018-02-21 12:46:07 I think you’re referring to kale leaves? Blooming autocorrect  I rub the leaves all over with coconut oil and a bit of salt and cook on about 80 degrees for a few hours x

5919 2018-02-21 12:44:44 Reality check, people!

If your local KFC is closed, go to the supermarket and buy chicken pieces (skin on), oil, flour, eggs, dried mixed herbs and Chinese five spice - it's never gonna taste the same, so keep it simple.

Take them home and @Google a fried chicken recipe.

5931 2018-02-21 12:42:32 One important reason Russia wanted Trump is lifting sanctions against Russian oligarchs and oil- and gazcompanies like Rosneft. Rosneft f.e. had a giant deal with Exxon (Tillerson) for 500 billion dollar (!) that stopped because of the sanctions.
5932 2018-02-21 12:42:24 Mine used to do that to me till it swells and I just become an immobile mass until I figured baby oil helps.

5935 2018-02-21 12:41:36 French? How strange. I take multi vitamins, vitamin C and cod liver oil tablets. But yes could be diet related! Might be worth asking the GP for a blood test.
5936 2018-02-21 12:41:36 Cannabis is licensed and used in the UK for spasticity so why can't the oil be used!
5937 2018-02-21 12:41:30 @theJeremyVine A lot of people with Tourette’s syndrome are finding CBD oil beneficial with far fewer side effects than the medication prescribed by doctors
5938 2018-02-21 12:41:27 My kids call it a river. It’s actually more like a small stream. And no oil.  Just us hillbillies. 
5939 2018-02-21 12:41:19 I don't care if Venezuela starts giving out free hugs when you buy oil against the Petro Dollar, point is that the USD and the banking infrastructure to settle it is being replaced in the number 1 global commodity. You bet other countries will be watching
5940 2018-02-21 12:41:10 Are you serious? This the Country with the biggest oil reserves in the world and it’s broke! How can someone believe that a token will give them stability?

5955 2018-02-21 12:39:57 @theJeremyVine Everybody in their right mind already knows canabis (and especially its oil) has medicinal properties. The denial to reduce the child's suffering is nothing more than useless posturing by the politicians for the sake of their "moral values".

6020 2018-02-21 12:28:42 Yes! I was talking about sick coffee last week some did not know what I was speaking of! And have to have the oil slick rainbow!
6021 2018-02-21 12:28:39 Interestingly, i started feeling bad during the taxi out and run up power checks. Not even taken off. So think its more the old oil smells and the close containedness etc. I felt a bit rough coming back but was fine again by landing. It was veeeery windy n gust tho.

6050 2018-02-21 12:24:49 I use oil too (rapeseed). Ghee (or in my case homemade clarified butter) is essential for birista (crispy fried onions), paratha and for brushing on naan.

6081 2018-02-21 12:19:17 Erdogan never supported ISIS and never looked the other way on ISIS petrol smuggling. FETO was doing the oil smuggling, and when they were purged, it stopped and TSK was able to arrest the smugglers.

6093 2018-02-21 12:17:55 Unlike mineral oil, there is no chance of having any adverse side effects on the skin from the application of this oil. Therefore, it has been safely used for thousands of years for preventing dryness and flaking of skin. Yes, you read it right – thousands of years!
6094 2018-02-21 12:17:54 See, you can't use the same economical theories that govern society in our reality with those of a place like Wakanda. That's why all questions about Wakanda this, Wakanda that falls flat on their face.

6110 2018-02-21 12:13:57 There was no oil, these first industries ran on coal. Steam locomotives were used to transport raw materials out of the hinterland. Steam powered ships purchased from Britain, transported finished products to international markets.

6141 2018-02-21 12:09:57 It’s soy oil and raw soy sauce. It’s no secret. It’s part of “Shoujin Ryouri” (精進料理) for Buddhist monks in Kyoto for hundreds of years.
6142 2018-02-21 12:09:46 I love it all, especially the @inner_senses body oil. Oh my days! ♡♡♡
6143 2018-02-21 12:09:45 Depends on your choice.  Usually minced pork, garlic, Chinese cabbage, minced mushroom, or instead of minced pork you can put shrimp  salt and sesame oil, oyster sauce and the like.
6144 2018-02-21 12:09:26 IS THAT SO? DOES THIS WORK? CITRONELLA ESSENTIAL OIL?
6145 2018-02-21 12:09:16 This reasoning has always been backwards though. Oil price shocks are primarily driven by demand not supply. So higher is usually a good sign, regardless

6173 2018-02-21 12:03:27 More expensive oil is still a tax on consumers. But that tax is increasingly offset by the boost to energy investment, production and jobs. The U.S. business cycle is thus now tied in complex and surprising ways to the global oil market

6180 2018-02-21 12:02:45 The effect of oil prices on the U.S. economy used to be straightforward: Higher was bad. Yet between 2014 and early 2016, as oil collapsed, growth slowed sharply. Since then oil has doubled, yet the economy has accelerated.
6181 2018-02-21 12:02:45 I'm just about done with winter now to be honest, fed up of heating up the jar of coconut oil with a hairdryer so I don't have to scrape it

We will need to convert to a new medium of energy production. Also, with oil companies being such an integral part of our economy, how will we deal

India also fears that once CPEC takes a final shape it would render the Chahbhar sea port redundant, its supplies of oil from Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia would become totally dependent on the good will of Pakistan and China
6583 2018-02-21 10:56:35 At the rate you're going, pretty soon pictures and drawings will be all we have to remember how Alaska looked before your big oil buddies, Scott Pruitt and our "businessman" president, all of whom you support and enable, destroyed it.
6584 2018-02-21 10:56:31 The CPEC has tremendous advantages for both China and 
Pakistan. Besides shortening distance for transportation 
from Shanghai to Europe and oil from the Gulf to mainlandChina, it will enable China to playthe role of a major imports export in the world.

6585 2018-02-21 10:56:27 I love how ppl rate PSG now, post oil money, 5 years ago they were saying French league was a joke. People really don't understand how the world works $$$
6586 2018-02-21 10:56:22 I found #18. Looking dodgy. I've popped on some gloves, lubed with olive oil, cleaned her out. Andrè is worried if he gets ill. #crookchook

6590 2018-02-21 10:55:58 We went to sleep and woke-up owing Billions on Oil Subsidy we were not aware off and now being blackmailed, and oh yes, Elections are around the corner...
6591 2018-02-21 10:55:54 Also, a problem hasn't been solved - Oil leakage, yet for servicing they charged 5000₹. They were claiming that they need permission to open engine and check it and were charging 4000₹ again. I am not willing to pay single penny at that service center.
6592 2018-02-21 10:55:49 Through medication and narcotics smuggling, ivory and people trafficking, oil theft and piracy, Africa is, by conservative estimates, losing about $50 billion a year in illicit financial flows — more, in fact, than it receives in official development assistance.

6593 2018-02-21 10:55:47 Try a few mm of light oil in the gauge to stop evaporation. Just need to top up every time you empty gauge.

6598 2018-02-21 10:54:55 Just check out Reza Zarrab case in NY 2 months ago. He was laundering Iran's oil money into the international (US) banking system. Venezuella is trying to get rid of sanctions thru crypto currencies. Which makes sense of their behalf
6599 2018-02-21 10:54:51 Well taken. They cannot because the are govt owned oil assets that secure govt bonds.
6600 2018-02-21 10:54:47 oh i think i havent update you guys, i got a whole tub of fish oil with 400 capsules because i copy paste a complaint email and sent to the company
6601 2018-02-21 10:54:42 It disgusts me that Scotland has the oil fields and yet it's a LOT cheaper South of the border. I'm paying 130.9 for diesel on Isle of Lewis.. 128.9 near Oban. That's what I call costly independence! Someones making money from it. #UKGovt

6612 2018-02-21 10:51:27 either way my point is recoverable oil and oil in in place are totally different. Its like comparing a company with $10m revenue with a compang producing $10m profit. Cant cross compare, each are prospect specific. If recoverable oil figures arent being stated you have to ask why

6711 2018-02-21 10:31:45 If the oil was in the northern sea of Cyprus, what would have happened now.  'Oh let Turkey have it to keep the peace'. Talking round the table to other Greek Cypriots politicians gets you nowhere.  You are talk and no action.  Turkey eventually will take over all Cyprus.
6712 2018-02-21 10:31:44 They’re fried in the same oil as the meat.
6713 2018-02-21 10:31:07 I used to enjoy them too...til I found out they contained palm oil. Now, they just taste of the bitter tears of a baby orangutan, orphaned by the destruction of their habitat
6714 2018-02-21 10:30:48 i put oil on my nails that i found downstairs and i’m not even sure it’s fore nail 
6715 2018-02-21 10:30:46 OIL DIFF: 3.45 -> 3.57
6716 2018-02-21 10:30:44 Lots of people self medicating. My nephew in canada had a bad accident skydiving. He also has cancer. He has been prescribed cannabis oil and it has improved his life by miles. A campaign of mass disobedience would maybe help ?
6717 2018-02-21 10:30:37 Transformer oil fries are tasty though, I’m not kidding. Do your research. 
6718 2018-02-21 10:30:26 Like a desperate try to get short-term funding? Wonder if there is truly any legal claim on Venezuela's oil reserves if you possess PTR. Don't think so either. But I didn't have the time to read the White Paper so far....
6719 2018-02-21 10:30:22 More than KES 120...crude oil prices are going up. The sad bit is that about 50% of this is purely taxes.
6720 2018-02-21 10:30:02 BP says world's oil consumption will peak in late 2030s. France surrenders.

6725 2018-02-21 10:28:12 Hmm. A dubious "leader" distinction. It will mean higher oil import costs. Simply adding more cars to already congested roads and a lack of focus on efficient urban transportation is bad policy and planning.

6777 2018-02-21 10:16:44 The answer to that of course, is Westminster's appaling management and waste of our resources. Anyway, I wasn't speaking just about oil. With 25% of Europe's wind and tidal energy potential, we will remain Europe's largest energy producer for the foreseeable future.

6796 2018-02-21 10:12:12 Nothing there that I don't already know, but all irrelevant. GDP is irrelevant as a measure of anything useful. Oil prices go up and down, this is not news. What should be news, but never is, is how Norway made $17bn from the same amount of oil last year, while Scotland made 0.

6806 2018-02-21 10:08:07 Somehow capitalism is always at fault. Not the fact that Venezuela has a planned economy and relied on one fucking resource, oil, which makes it no surprise that their economy fails when the oil price decreases, and then tries to fix it by printing money. It's their fault alone.

6820 2018-02-21 10:02:41 Recovery factor varies significantly depending on fluid type (oil/gas), reservoir type (conventional/unconventional), depositional environment and more.  Your estimate is towards the low end, conventional oil recovery factors are likely to be in the 25-40% range and gas >50%.

6824 2018-02-21 10:01:40 In 2004 Putin even said that he did not object to Ukraine joining the EU, although he had strong objections to it joining NATO. (The former position only changed when he tried to set up his own 'Eurasian' EU in 2012, which needed Ukraine's oil)
6825 2018-02-21 10:01:25 You're absolutely right in your blog post. And worship of coconut oil (which is not without its uses, sure) is generally an indictator of stupidity. Like clean eating or homeopathy.

6850 2018-02-21 09:56:49 The whole Syria debacle is oil. All the Middle East is oil.
6851 2018-02-21 09:56:37 I use hyaluronic acid gel, sea kelp coral, and rosehip oil on my skin daily and use coconut oil in my hair and body.
6852 2018-02-21 09:56:33 Interesting. Changes in regulations for #plastic consumption such as stringent policies on plastic bags & packaging could dent oil demand by as much as 2 million bpd, roughly same as impact of electric vehicles. Will big oil try to keep plastic use high to protect their profits?

6854 2018-02-21 09:56:22 Corporate taxes are passed on to the consumer as a cost of doing business, so 45% tax on a oil company means you pay more for everything

6873 2018-02-21 09:52:27 The EU is an ideology NOT a free trade area. The Common Market was a free trade agreement that worked (even though it held the UK back at a time when North Sea Oil & Gas was boosting GDP). Lisbon Treaty should have been a treaty too far for the UK. We should be out now!

6885 2018-02-21 09:49:31 a) German trade with Iran is tiny compared to China &amp; Russia. Now Iran starts to massively export oil to India.

b) Only trade, integration and prosperity will help to win Iranian people for western values. Isolation only helps hardliners.

6896 2018-02-21 09:47:28 So you now admit the #Chinese bought the Gold - I thought you said it was the Bankers. Gold or Oil  are commodities. Without a market commodities devalue - so owning Gold can result in a profit or a loss. Do you suggest Communism is better than capitalism ?

6901 2018-02-21 09:45:52 Increasingly aware not many (worryingly) know the difference between "recoverable oil" and "oil in place". The latter totally meaningless unless attached with a recovery factor.. recovery factors typically 10-20%.
6902 2018-02-21 09:45:47 Prices remain supported ahead of the cold snap, with length in the gas system and oil downside keeping any significant bullish movement in check.  #power #gas #energymarket #oil #renewables #coldsnap

6931 2018-02-21 09:37:07 Liberals are amazingly good at finding suitable hate figures in countries rich in resources like oil. And sending other people's sons & daughters to die for the 'cause'. Which partly explains the rise of Trump and the Brexiteers.
6932 2018-02-21 09:36:45 That's great, but I'd like to see you get 5.6 GW of nuclear through Australian planning frameworks in 8 years, let alone constructed and financed.
UAE is oil rich and planning is done in palaces without consultation. Very different game.
6933 2018-02-21 09:36:27 Great chart and very helpful, notice some figures are STOIIP and some are recoverable oil... reckon worth making them all recoverable oil for clarity.

6994 2018-02-21 09:18:44 If the rules and regulations are not appropriate to the UK it's because they apply to an activity not carried out in the UK... like olive oil production.

7000 2018-02-21 09:17:46 It was horrible and most people did try to do something but governments failed them. No oil no motive to help.
7001 2018-02-21 09:17:29 Agreed.  That said, my understanding is that Saudi has kept oil prices down the last several years as a means of hurting both Russia and Iran over Syria. Much as I dislike SA, their policy is probably doing more damage to the Russian economy.
7002 2018-02-21 09:17:03 For the love of Christ he still sticks to that dumb story. He has no idea what patchouli oil is and that its got a very strong smell. When I confronted him  he pretended there was just random oil on steering wheel after I told him what I knew.

You know this already!

7118 2018-02-21 08:48:39 Paper says you bought 14,000 dollars worth of wax and hash oil from and under cover different story or same guy?
7119 2018-02-21 08:48:35 I don't do it often but I love anointing myself with oils and special treatments. I bought a bottle of argan oil at TJ's and now I want to slather my whole body and emerge anew.
7120 2018-02-21 08:48:28 Regarding the oil issues Audi UK and USA put new engines in as standard on warranty. I have an A5  which had this issue and at 30k miles got a brand new engine free. Fight them.

7129 2018-02-21 08:46:14 Is car diesel worse than petrol spillage? Or fuel oil?
7130 2018-02-21 08:46:04 I’m experiencing oil consumption issues; went to Audi and was basically told to sort it out myself, an issue they caused by their poor design.
7131 2018-02-21 08:45:39 It smells fake! These figures are all covered with a protective plastic film and if my memories are good there is even on the shoulder joints. For having already received fake, the joints are soft, they do not stand up and they give off a strong smell of plastic, paint, oil 
7132 2018-02-21 08:45:37 At $65/bl, oil is still 20-30pc above where it was last spring ($50-55).
7133 2018-02-21 08:45:28 I think the federal government should speed up action on revamping our refineries.
Very shameful that we still import fuel.

7383 2018-02-21 07:54:58 So liberals dance around their petrulli oil shrine when a private Christian bakery gets sued for not wanting to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple but are fine with the discrimination in this.
7384 2018-02-21 07:54:14 @realDonaldTrump amazing that this promise disappeared, could it be because it impacted the oil boys $ since the ban on solar panels not made in the US seemed to be no problem as it is an alternative to the oil boys profits.

7395 2018-02-21 07:50:55 ??? A car typically takes 5-8 quarts of oil. 5 quartz of oil generally runs ~$25-30 and then whatever filter you need. But yeah, still less than going out and paying for it usually
7396 2018-02-21 07:50:30 Dude tbh I LOVE THE cetaphil oil control moisturizer!!!!!! I discovered it at work! It gives you that intense hydration that your skin needs (usually when your oily your skin is dehydrated from the oils it actually needs so it produces “bad oils” that give the oily look)

7402 2018-02-21 07:49:04 Seems to me that there is only one choice.. Bail out and go Independent.. Nationalise you Natural Assets like Gas, Oil etc. Take the revenues and use them for Scotland's Benifit not England's

7405 2018-02-21 07:48:32 Good questions.  I think the appropriate question to ask is "What is the alternative?".  With rail cars there is no valve shutoff, and most rail-routes run along rivers and bodies of h2o.  Pipelines are the safer alternative.  Oil by rail is a dangerous mobile pipeline.  Cheers.

7451 2018-02-21 07:38:28 For as long as I can remember the international community has despised america for Its unjust wars for oil and.with their massive financial contributions from propaganda Media giants.

7528 2018-02-21 07:23:35 Also curious if there is a viable future where we significantly reduce transportation emissions in ON and QB and there is still a market for Alberta's oil, given its price.
If we achieve near zero emission transportation what do we do with all that oil?
7529 2018-02-21 07:23:28 You’re no oil painting. Just a foul mouthed idiot

7531 2018-02-21 07:22:38 Try and divert attention from the sinking ship; as your “policies” have done very little for anyone. Many people are worse off than before. Except big corporations of course; your buddies in big oil oh; the NRA, anyone related to you, and your businesses selling to the Russians
7532 2018-02-21 07:22:26 Yeah! I got some with coconut oil in it too and omg I don’t think my skins ever been so soft. Also found this really good sugar scrub and soap and glory bath bombs are target that were just as amazing
7533 2018-02-21 07:21:59 About 20 times as likely, excluding suicides.
7534 2018-02-21 07:21:56 @PetroleumSummit Acrdng to a Gartner report in '17, frm 1860's thru 1900's, the value chain for oil and gas was forged via disruptive chnge. Since then, the biz model has bn stable. Nw, digital techs, altntv energy srces n sociocultural shifts are forcing a nw wave of disruptions

7537 2018-02-21 07:20:45 I really need to buy myself an essential oil diffuser asap
7538 2018-02-21 07:20:34 Sometimes skin just doesn't produce enough water. But it produces oil so it can just absorb the oil you put in it. Look at more gel based moisturiser. Like the Clinique moisture surge
7539 2018-02-21 07:20:10 3) Would you want a gasoline / jet-fuel pipeline in your backyard vs. a crude oil pipeline?

Pour a barrel of gasoline in a creek and then try getting it back in vs. crude oil.
7540 2018-02-21 07:20:07 I'm Canadian but follow American politics (obsessively). I'm watching the US collide into an oil filled freight train.

7542 2018-02-21 07:19:40 When we are on diet eating out can be tricky. 
 
Get satisfied by following these tips: 

1. Choose low calorie options that will not hamper your fitness goals.
2. Salad and soup are the best appetisers.
3. Always suggest to double the veggies.
Cook your food in less oil.

Also, I think the reason is is not prescribed is that approved drugs need to go through rigorous testing which hasn't been done. In Canada marijuana is legal for personal use if you've a medical reason.
7549 2018-02-21 07:18:12 Yup. Gotta keep driving, burning coal and oil & drinking milk because science has spent the last 30+ years warning us of the consequences of climate change.

7562 2018-02-21 07:16:24 That's funny coming from a man who cried "selective prosecution" the last time he was in a court room. You project your own "snowflakeness" onto them.

7572 2018-02-21 07:14:50 Oil prices are informed by OPEC decisions. So the prices of crude oil in the global market are the guide for ERC locally. If we find commercially viable oil, local prices will not be affected.

7587 2018-02-21 07:12:20 Except the whole part where the Congo's been fucked forever and Cobalt until recently became very valuable. The Congo's best hope is probably the Saudis and the UAE deciding to diversify from oil. Although the DRC's rhetoric is starting to mirror OPEC
7588 2018-02-21 07:12:08 "The O&G industry there is such a tiny part of the Canadian economy now"? Everything you use & enjoy in your daily life is thanks to the oil & gas industry in some form or another. Everything.

7814 2018-02-21 06:26:40 For once let's forget his pandering of the Khalistanis, this liberal god of yours pander shamelessly to oil companies too. I thought saving the environment is an agenda for all liberals or have Trudeau's photo ops blinded you to his glaring non-liberal policies?

7915 2018-02-21 06:08:17 Thank you Hubert. Oil is an interesting asset indeed! It has been rather difficult to assess during the past years. Expecting the oil complex to remain challenging.
7916 2018-02-21 06:07:53 Its all for the rise in the price of crude oil. Keep quiet!

7920 2018-02-21 06:06:50 Crude oil price has more than DOUBLED since 2015 handover..in any case over half of the Foreign Reserves was in place prior to the handover. Inflation is trending down because at some point the dollar traded above N500 and it is only being 'managed' today. GEJ put $1b in the SWF.

7970 2018-02-21 05:57:10 The trick is to not have that much oil with each one & don't try to pour the whole mix in that mf  pour slow & allow the grease to do the rest mane  it's easy.. just take practice.. ITS FLIPPING THEM MFS is where the real challenge lies

I know Borthern Alberta kinda well. There’s Edmonton near the centre and there’s Fort McMurray and Dalhousie and Albertsford or whatever it’s called
ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW NORTHERN ALBERTA SUPER WELL BECAUSE ITS LITERALLY JUST TREES AND OIL SANDS (!!) AND SNOW AND TOWNS
7988 2018-02-21 05:52:56 You know that feeling when you have an insanely productive day and you decide that you're superwoman and can do anything? I think I found my self-imposed limit. Watching videos on how to change my car's oil and just thinking "dear god, I'll pay to never have to do that."
7989 2018-02-21 05:52:55 @DiMartinoBooth The reason why inflation was a problem in the 70's the realignment of currencies after breakdown of Bretton Woods.Nixon devalued dollar Aug 1971.
Wage negotiations provided for costs increases like transport.See this in relation to oil shocks as one eg.

7991 2018-02-21 05:52:35 I bought the collection! Minus some lipsticks and new bronzers and my boyfriend gifted me the hydrating oil. It was a great weekend thanks to @ABHcosmetics and you norvina

7998 2018-02-21 05:51:16 Okay so I have dry and oily skin I use more than one products. I use witch hazel first, then a face cleaner, then I’ll put tea tree oil in my problem areas, then shea butter
7999 2018-02-21 05:51:14 Castor oil is great for hair growth, I regrew my terribly plucked eyebrows in no time  but I would highly recommend

8003 2018-02-21 05:51:04 Nothing for the conscious and moral investor. And for the greedy: it's value is fixed, tied to the declining commodity called oil. No crazy gains to make here either.
8004 2018-02-21 05:51:03 Sprinkle salt, lemon and olive oil, then bake it

8010 2018-02-21 05:50:20 So, do you think anyone out there wants kids to get killed?
8011 2018-02-21 05:50:17 That could be true, and not doubting that it would be better than what we currently have.
My dislike for these solutions is that we must first rollback all the protections given to big Pharma and the Rockefeller's AMA snake oil plan.
I don't want a govt mandated medical plan!

8027 2018-02-21 05:47:44 OK, so the chart shows each of the existing major uses of coal oil and gas, right? And the black line is the MZJ estimate of electrical energy needed to do all the same stuff, when electrified? The MZJ line looks OK. But e.g. 5000 MTOE looks too high for 2016 total electricity.

I've picked up a lot of little cooking tips over the years. 

One of my favorite tips is that by adding coconut oil to your kale, it makes it much easier to scrape it into the trash.

8077 2018-02-21 05:38:37 The Bengali organisations and some of the Bongs might do lip service and condemn to oil the Assamese. But deep inside they have always been anti-Assamese. You’d rarely find Bongs in Assam who’d talk to you in Assamese even when they know the language.

Keep your lies and your ignorance in your province along with your dirty oil. We're still dealing with the consequences and pollution from oil spills that happened 20 years ago.

8240 2018-02-21 05:11:06 Someone: how it going?
Me: oh you know everything’s fine. I just had an ingrown hair in my region and put tea tree oil on it and practically poured in on my vagina and now it burns. But other that than I’m great 
8241 2018-02-21 05:10:52 If they can land a 1st and flip it w/ another piece to help add a legit D man in the summer, it would  be well worth considering.

8243 2018-02-21 05:10:33 Coal spills don't destroy everything around them forever. Its a shitty obsolete tech like oil but it carries far fewer risks than pipelines and oil tankers.

8247 2018-02-21 05:10:05 It is also illegal to resell the food you qualify for to obtain in stores and use that money to buy weapons, gasoline/oil/anti-freeze, guns, drugs, hardware, computers, radios, TV's, go to movies, buy bus tickets, train tickets, air liner tickets, pay for a taxi, buy alcohol, etc
8248 2018-02-21 05:09:58 Using my commissions I earn from my CTFO CBD oil business to save and pay off debt! Extra money always comes in handy.
8249 2018-02-21 05:09:57 #IPWeek2018 Day 2:
• Lots of people still sceptical US #shale will deliver 11m b/d end-2018 (a widely held view is last 3-4 months growth rate is a blip)
• Lots of talk of light US crude already hit refining wall in the Americas and soon to hit it globally

8253 2018-02-21 05:09:16 Good. Why risk our economy, our pristine wilderness and ecosystem and our endangered orcas for a technology that is guaranteed to spill and will only create 90 jobs in BC. Oil is a dying industry. Alberta needs to wake up to that and invest in new sectors.
8254 2018-02-21 05:09:14 In Texas having the THC OIL or the gummies is a felony
8255 2018-02-21 05:09:14 I didn’t say Hall was the reason the Oil were losing, I said I don’t miss Hall.  And I’m not upset at losing him AND am not angry about the return.  I also didn’t ever say I wanted them to trade Hall.  But since you read my last 1000 tweets you know that.

8259 2018-02-21 05:08:24 I would recommend using Dawn dishwashing soap.  It’s used to clean animals covered in petroleum, so it might work in removing oil from your hair
8260 2018-02-21 05:08:22 The fact that all the tweets I got showing are @LunkersTV and @outlawdipper I'm just laughing cuz I've been scrolling for 5 minutes and they're all I see with the odd tweet from @lakeforkguy and the googans. I'm coming to join it all 2019 as soon as I'm done in the oil fields

8263 2018-02-21 05:07:52 I have to say, I’m intrigued (ok obsessed) with my new diffuser and essential oil. I love I decide to splurge a little on myself, and it ends up being money well spent. 
8264 2018-02-21 05:07:43 Real talk I will take care of a woman and she won't have too do not but cook,clean,wash,iron,take the trash,wash the car,change the oil,pick up the kids,drop em off,and porn star sex every night. If you can't do that then we both gots to work.

 WTI   $61.90
8274 2018-02-21 05:07:02 Nigeria’s tax potential’s enormous. Until now, Govt. has taken that for granted due to huge oil revenues. It needs to look at the waivers and concessions policies. The reciprocity from beneficiaries is lackluster. Rather, the revenues can be used to directly benefit the economy.
8275 2018-02-21 05:06:50 What will happen if PPRD decided to pull out the workers in their construction industry? Healthcare? Oil and gas? Forget the household workers... Can he do that? Maybe. Maybe not. That's why he is accused of getting money from the Kuwaitis....

8279 2018-02-21 05:06:28 UPDATE:Governor’s Office:Gov. Brown met w/ Interior Secretary Zinke this afternoon in Sac re: CA’s opposition to federal govt. expanding oil/gas drilling off coast. “Secretary Zinke made it clear that California’s views will be taken into account.”
8280 2018-02-21 05:06:25 Ummm, those placards on those tank cars look black and white, meaning they are corrosive chemical carrying cars not flammable liquid carrying cars.  A train carrying crude oil would have a red and white placards.  Nice try though
8281 2018-02-21 05:06:25 More production is the right's higher MPG. Both fail to break oil's monopoly on moving things. Real way out is more fuels, drivetrains.
8282 2018-02-21 05:06:18 Meh. Depends on return.
8283 2018-02-21 05:06:04 If demand is likely to palteau by 2030 why keep killing the Arabs/Muslims for possesing the oil under the gise of Freedom. there has  not been any freedom in Iraq, Libya, Syria and definitely some of the African countries.

8287 2018-02-21 05:05:55 Those guys are movable pieces and the return for JVR could be useful to help fill a hole in the not to distant future. Tough call to make but...

8322 2018-02-21 05:02:04 I hate to tell you this. But the reason those US Funded ENGOs do so well is because people here share those values.  Tell me.

8365 2018-02-21 04:54:56 It would be the ultimate irony if Chavez’s effort to have all property owned by the government ended up leaving the country’s oil production in the hands of hedge funds that bought it for pennies on the dollar.

8377 2018-02-21 04:53:07 Thats cuz the US military underestimated Russia’s geopolitical leverage by befriending Assad & them aiding terrorist groups that have failed. Now that Turkey has gotten involved cuz their pipeline agreement w/ Putin, one can see how vital that region is for oil/resources.

8389 2018-02-21 04:51:09 I hate when currently perfect skinned, previously terrible skinned 'beauty gurus' lie on all this pseudo-natural shit to put on your face like oil washes and lavender face mists to clear your skin. Just say you got on birth control or went to a dermatologist and keep it moving.

8397 2018-02-21 04:50:18 Some notes for Oil fans.

1) Mark Arcobello has a good chance be back on your team. Playing well in Korea.

2) James Wisnewski has only had power play time in Korea and could also probably be on the team. 

3) Why on earth would you want to sign the defensive liability Maroon?
8398 2018-02-21 04:50:00 @GOP Seems as if you have NO TRAFFIC? Do you think it has ANYTHING at all to do with the fact you sold us out to Russia, NRA, OIL and the 10% Did you REALLY think the people would continue to support you? Where are your BOTS? Only working for trump now? #TrumpColluded
8399 2018-02-21 04:49:59 Seconded.  My other last ditch when  excedrin doesn't even touch it is peppermint oil on the temples. just a teensy bit, not enough to make your eyes burn.
8400 2018-02-21 04:49:53 We buy them shredded. We then toss with garlic infused olive oil, thinly sliced yellow onion & @TajinUSA and then roast for about 10-20 minutes -- It's different & so tasty. #vegetables #plantbased

8412 2018-02-21 04:47:28 Due to the market on oil being flooded.
Look, I'm of the opinion that the oil shouldn't be extracted.  I don't think the market will make it viable.

8442 2018-02-21 04:44:24 I have been trying for three days to chase down a recipe for a particular banchan I had once at a local Korean place which I've never had since and still can't get over.  It was some type of firm tofu slices in sesame oil and it was the definition of savoriness and chewy texture.
8443 2018-02-21 04:44:11 The challenging one is for Tammy. I'm painting six portraits in oil! It's exciting and scary lol.

8446 2018-02-21 04:43:49 We have that too! It’s called kibbeh neeyeh and it’s basically steak tartare soaked in olive oil. What’s weird is that in every other beef dish, the meat has to be cooked somewhere between well-done and ashes. Relatives still freak out when I order my steak medium-rare.

8451 2018-02-21 04:43:19 As one American site reported. Premier Oil reduced its estimated investment and equipment and facilities required for the business from $ 1.8 billion to $ 1.5 billion. Much spent and little profit, the island will return to Argentina for administrative reasons
8452 2018-02-21 04:43:03 I liked when Lumin used to accidentally become good friends with villains and they would drop their evil antics around him.

Like Do-S. Whom he made an oil painting of as a gift.
8453 2018-02-21 04:42:52 Such articles just runs down all the noble effort towards producing sustainable certified palm oil.
8454 2018-02-21 04:42:41 Price of oil has nothing to do with economic development initiatives.  There was an NDP plan to diversity many sectors of the industrial sector including a petro-chemical diversification initiative.  Programs to build new air service at YEG/YYC.  Calgary ring-road completion etc.
8455 2018-02-21 04:42:34 You just don’t get it. It’s fine. We lost anyways and I’m done talking about it.
8456 2018-02-21 04:42:31 Yeah this really confused me cause coconut oil is antibacterial and anti fungal. That’s why I don’t use it in the vag cause I don’t want to kill everything off, but I wouldn’t tell others not to if it’s working for them.

8480 2018-02-21 04:40:19 Maybe that's your problem then, it's in pill form. Doc specifically told me to use the oil, and put 2 drops under your tongue to start out, using 4-6 times a day, and increase the number of drops if you need to. *disclaimer, I'm NOT giving medical advice (don't wanna get sued.)
8481 2018-02-21 04:39:53 Perhaps, a guy who was not able to get good rank for IAS, became IRS and taking out his frustration on honourable chief secretary.

discover southern asian cuisine.

that covers a lot of ground.

8493 2018-02-21 04:38:37 Malvinas does not own even 10,000 people, British companies can not find oil on the island and military spending to maintain the island hits millions. As I said, it's only a matter of time before Argentina can regain the island.

8501 2018-02-21 04:37:28 Worked and studied my brain off today, paid all of my bills, bought my COA exam review book, new wireless earphones for the gym, talked to my mama, signed up for a new skin care program, rubbed some olive oil in my hair, and in bed before 12. I'm proud of myself.

8506 2018-02-21 04:36:42 The entire Bible is about the fight between God and Satan. Satan regularly targets and attacks the people of God.

8507 2018-02-21 04:36:35 My dad did contract work for Pedevesa (national oil co.) assessing Venezuela’s Oil reserves. 

Guess what, they are far lower than the national estimates.  So those “Petros” aren’t really there. 

Good luck with all that.

8509 2018-02-21 04:36:15 I think my hair grows fast because i have oily ass hair so the trick to growing long hair is to do homemade, oil hair masks!!! At least once a week especially if you dont have oily hair

8516 2018-02-21 04:35:20 Yes. But the player who scored the goal could have been taken clear out of the play and the situation you’re talking about would have been a moot point. No one would have been there to grab that Talbot deflection off of the boards.

8543 2018-02-21 04:31:46 Why is he destroying my National Parks?  Why is he raising the prices so much?  Does he really believe that the parks will look better with oil rigs, gas rigs, fracking, or mining happening?  Why is he spending my tax dollars on his travel?
8544 2018-02-21 04:31:45 He does have golf courses (well, at least one) in CA where the off-shore oil rigs he wants to put on our coast could be seen and of course, they could be damaged by a quake.  Maybe he plans on selling.

As I already said all the pipelines were built due south - the only 'Alberta oil' coming east all these decades was refined and piped through the US.

I'm bored now.

8572 2018-02-21 04:28:33 While the petro is “backed” by oil, substantial stakes in the nation’s prized oil projects are already owned by the likes of Russia. And it doesn’t help that Venezuela’s congress has said the petro tokens are illegal because the legislature didn’t approve the transaction.

A puck off of Stromes skate? 
It wouldn’t have happened if Klefbom would have hit him clean at the boards. He walked around him and had a wrap around goal and any hockey mind would cringe at that defensive play.
8592 2018-02-21 04:25:57 Between the price of oil crashing and Obama's sanctions, the Russian economy essentially crashed. I would question the competency of who ever suggests otherwise

8607 2018-02-21 04:23:59 Sure and you're complaining about a puck that bounced off Strome's skate & into the net. It was a harmless play that ended up where it did b/c of a bounce. Shit happens.

8669 2018-02-21 04:14:20 There are entire essential oil pyramid scheme companies bilking people out of their money and spreading really dangerous misinformation about their health uses and it is infuriating!

8716 2018-02-21 04:09:42 Grease money from Russian Oil, grease money for being the token loon on CNN, and big speaking fees from the GOP & it’s various offshoot “think tanks” and organizations. Just money.
8717 2018-02-21 04:09:34 I watched 1000 YouTube videos I hope it works. The oil is so cheap too. Fingers crossed
8718 2018-02-21 04:09:31 Not only that, but I wake up and can’t fall back asleep. I’ve tried benedryl, lavender essential oil, meditation, not eating past 7-8, no screen time 30 min before bed, etc. someone halp

8723 2018-02-21 04:09:01 I would love to see the net totals too but I can’t find any documents. I know oil jobs are still down and are unlikely to return to previous peak levels but value-added and tech jobs are WAY up.

8731 2018-02-21 04:08:12 Entertaining all and any scenarios that don’t involve this years 1st, 29/97. Everyone else is fair game. Unfortunately it’s a harder deal to come by considering what little options the Oilers have internally.
8732 2018-02-21 04:08:04 If the people of BC knew how bad they need this oil, the pipeline would be already started!
8733 2018-02-21 04:08:00 Plan - Cause conflict in MidEast, create oil "shortage", spike price, cover to drop sanctions, Tillerson's state dept green lights all Putins wish list. Putin, Tillerson, Trump all get the payoff. This was obvious since the campaign

Oil has a biologic component but nobody believes it is from dinosaurs anymore.
Microbial action on existing carbon my best guess.
So , is cracking killing the microbes that create the oil?

8743 2018-02-21 04:06:56 $50,000. To tell Alberta ( their main income) to shut down the oil sands which support and supply money for all canadians is awful. If they have those kinds of dollars cut their salaries.  Suzuki bleeds you fools
8744 2018-02-21 04:06:20 How do these differ from other essential oil brands?
8745 2018-02-21 04:06:20 Jaccard lost a lot of credibility in my book with his defence of Site C. Leach has a much stronger practical grasp of how energy industries (both oil & gas and electricity) actually work.

8809 2018-02-21 03:55:22 Democrats are vile lawless haters.  When those responsible for enforcing the law become lawless then they destroy trust in the law, & the law of the jungle begins to prevail.  Everone then has to Become their own law.  This is corrupt!

8815 2018-02-21 03:54:39 If that were true, 18.3% oil and gas, largest, next is 15.1 for finance and real estate but that plummets if oil and gas plummet. Mfg only 6.3%. So that’s why the panic for the KM pipeline, NOT diverse!

8819 2018-02-21 03:54:04 Yes Saudi oil that we buy in Canada is dirty as dirty can be, but boy oh boy it’s sweet crude!  Also Canada oil is high quality just cheap because we have a market issue, simple economics

8830 2018-02-21 03:51:53 The taste of that bomb ass oil. That’s where it’s at
8831 2018-02-21 03:51:52 That’s because AB oil isn’t worth as much. Are you thick or just trying to rile up those who don’t know any better?
8832 2018-02-21 03:51:44 Lol. It will take more than just oil money to beat Barcelona. Pep doesn’t stand a chance.
8833 2018-02-21 03:51:39 @_nirajshah Oil Inda is ex-dividend. That is why it appears to be 5% down..
8834 2018-02-21 03:51:39 And on the right-wing, Trudeau’s sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and his promotion of oil sands expansion as somehow beneficial to the environment are pretty textbook CPC shenanigans.

8864 2018-02-21 03:48:25 Don’t agree with that at all,
8865 2018-02-21 03:48:24 So, if a company, that’s not an oil company, based in Alberta, expands to new markets therefore bringing money and wealth, jobs to our province, that means our government is too big, meddling and interventionist. Got it! #ucplogic #Ableg #abpoli

8879 2018-02-21 03:46:47 They stopped drilling for oil to protect Florida tourism.
I think they focused on the wrong wedge issue threatening tourism.

8887 2018-02-21 03:45:36 If you feel it in your lungs, I like to use tea tree oil. A couple of drops in steaming hot water, towel over head and head over bowl..
8888 2018-02-21 03:45:34 Ask Haley why the state dept. has had mass resignations, why so many embassies are not fully staffed, why an oil exec w no experience in diplomacy is Sec. of State? What is going on? This is RETREAT and GOP owes every American an APOLOGY for destroying US standing in the world.
8889 2018-02-21 03:45:33 Congratulations! BTW could you please send the United States some heating oil for our poor citizens as you did for years.

8890 2018-02-21 03:45:28 Love the way Trump is killing them and driving the price of oil down which hurts Putin more than Obama ever did.
8891 2018-02-21 03:45:26 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

8901 2018-02-21 03:44:13 You care for the environment? Me too. Pipelines are 1000's of times safer than trains. Oil will be consumed for at least 40 more years. That's reality.
8902 2018-02-21 03:44:12 oh yeah I appreciate advice always!! I think ur def right about using oil cause I have a really great no stick pan and I stopped using oil and never even thought about that

Fyi as others are pointing out Alberta bitumen is not equivalent to US crude oil that's why the price is lower.

8952 2018-02-21 03:38:42 "The Venezuelan government has said the value of the petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil."
-Sounds like a state secret
8953 2018-02-21 03:38:40 Because it seems that the city mainly cares about cleaning up roads. And I am may be wrong here, but I feel that, though the province should have changed and used its oil profits to get into renewable resources, it feels like you don't count in this city unless you own a car.
8954 2018-02-21 03:38:39 @conangray is coconut oil for my heart
8955 2018-02-21 03:38:26 I think beard oil is probably still really good for skin regardless of the presence of beard...

8960 2018-02-21 03:37:36 "the value of the #petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil. But the Maduro administration has not given many details on how this pricing would work"...  no surprise there
8961 2018-02-21 03:37:31 I just bought castor oil pellets to scatter in my lawn because I'm waging war on some moles. How do I make this sound cool
8962 2018-02-21 03:37:11 Yes that paragraph is out of the article that explains why they are not, the people did at one point own a share in the profits of the oil. But a dictator leader took over and bankrupted the country while replacing people with those who would be loyal to his dictatorship.
8963 2018-02-21 03:37:07 I would like to know how much eastern Canada pays for oil imported from the US? Could make money buying Alberta oil cheap and sell it back to eastern Canada?
8964 2018-02-21 03:37:01 Castor oil equals growth

8983 2018-02-21 03:34:17 Yes he thought Hillary would win. Because he like many of us believed that people wouldn't vote for a snake oil con man that has the maturity of a child. Shame on us for believing people would see through your awfulness.

8985 2018-02-21 03:34:09 I'm perfectly happy to criticse Maduro and Chavez's mistakes. They should have done more to diversify from oil, for example. They should have done more to protect themselves from economic warfare.

But you literally deny one half of the equation.
8986 2018-02-21 03:34:03 Take an economics class fraser. The oil pools up in Alberta and the price dips. Free flow to multiple markets pulls the price up. The oil will get to market eventually we may as well get more for it rather than transfer wealth to other places.
8987 2018-02-21 03:33:40 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8994 2018-02-21 03:33:07 Get a tall bin or garbage can, and make the inside slick w/ oil. Tape a piece of thin cardboard to the counter hanging over the bin (like a diving board) & put peanut butter or cheese on the end of it. He'll walk out onto the cardboard, fall into the bin, and he can't climb out.
8995 2018-02-21 03:32:40  they were afraid Sadam would come after them next and encouraged US to intercede, Iraq also threatened Petro dollar agreement demanding to be paid in Euros for his oil.
8996 2018-02-21 03:32:27 Does it call for oil? I have several eggless cake recipes so don’t panic!

9001 2018-02-21 03:31:09 When are we going to "run out of" oil? I remember hearing for DECADES about how that was supposed to happen. Fossil fuels and the oilsands are still necessary.
9002 2018-02-21 03:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.

9013 2018-02-21 03:30:00 Interesting that the thesis involves not taking refined foods. But, then olive oil is recommended for the low-carb group. Try replacing olive oil with ox tail?
9014 2018-02-21 03:29:41 The end of oil as king is coming into view.
9015 2018-02-21 03:29:41 Been very good this year though
9016 2018-02-21 03:29:39 Let you down how? She came back from serious knee injury to make the Olympic team and is standing on the podium.  What have you done other than buy the snake oil that DJT has been selling. The beauty of the USA, is that we don't  bend a knee to the president,  regardless of party
9017 2018-02-21 03:29:38 Oilers are two for two on that front
9018 2018-02-21 03:29:34 Bro I heard essential oil is why the US entered the Gulf War or something... 
9019 2018-02-21 03:29:27 @YouGotHeigld episode 6 (40 Days and 40 Nights): Once had a gyno tell me that vegetable oil was gentler on your lady parts during sex than lube (less chemicals or something). Have NOT tested that theory, but maybe why Hartnett ditched the Crisco.
9020 2018-02-21 03:29:19 We had corn and cottonseed oil, margarine in 60’s. Lots of antibiotics. I get gluten wasn’t big change. Removal helped me, as did reducing omega 6’s. Though they are hidden everywhere.
9021 2018-02-21 03:29:16 You have won. My money has been removed from Canadian oil/gas and moves to US. Very sad because we have great engineers who have to leave

9025 2018-02-21 03:28:31 It doesn't really matter but the Oilers  gotta be thrilled about ending up on the right side of the backup turn this evening...Khudobin has been downright awful.
9026 2018-02-21 03:28:27 I’ve been trying CBD oil too, it doesn’t always do enough but it does help.
9027 2018-02-21 03:28:24 There should be 20 Beard Oil companies going after #JujharKhaira for endorsements. #letsgooilers
9028 2018-02-21 03:28:20 Banila co. Clean it zero, heimish, both are cleansing balm. Harga around rm60 kat shopee. A'pieu cleansing oil around rm40.
9029 2018-02-21 03:28:05 Be a shame for Russian oil prices if Canada couldn't get its bountiful oil to market.
9030 2018-02-21 03:27:54 This has been an obvious challenge plaguing efficient local production of oil in Nigeria. Govt doesn't need to wait until almost 3 years before it realises the need to take this direction. I hope, this time, it yields positive outcome.
9031 2018-02-21 03:27:49 Just made a lip scrub out of coconut oil, brown sugar, and honey and it’s honestly amazing

9033 2018-02-21 03:27:20 @Dimitry49 do you use stock key caps on the Logitech g pro. I bought this keyboard and they keys seem to pick up oil way too much
9034 2018-02-21 03:27:17 In 2012, Hurricane Isaac largely disrupted the oil market. The Gulf produces about 30% of American oil and nearly 20% of the country’s natural gas. Fortify your supply chain now by having an execution plan. #KnowYourRoutes

9065 2018-02-21 03:22:42 Your entire argument hinges off one article about a particular mine. Try looking up pollution from burning coal/oil for the last 250 years. Renewables are booming while coal is dying.

9088 2018-02-21 03:19:31 I wish the NRA were the only problem. That would still suck, but it'd be better than Big Oil, Big Pharma, Wall Street, defense contractors, etc also all getting in on the act.
9089 2018-02-21 03:19:18 This is why I don’t get in these relationship debates about money on here. Y’all make splitting rent a big deal so I know her oil ain’t getting changed regularly.

9092 2018-02-21 03:19:03 our bitumen is sold at a discount because it requires further refining. There are several grades of oil and they fetch different prices regardless of transportation methods
9093 2018-02-21 03:18:56 The fact that my 19-year-old brother uses his essential oil diffuser every day reminds me just how closely related we are
9094 2018-02-21 03:18:56 They have Created ignorance thru our schooling Indoctrinated thru foreign donations. Universities take $ from rich Saudi!(We no longer need their oil!) +Foreign Teachers focus on brainwashingN2submission. “Non citizen focused” funding for schooling. American Citzens 1st!

9098 2018-02-21 03:17:47 Wow amazing 5,800 jobs! We lost 88,000 jobs last month justin. Maybe you need to focus on our greatest natural resource - oil - instead of taking your family on vacation to the Taj Mahal.
9099 2018-02-21 03:17:45 Today was day two of using CBD oil from @cwhemp on my #adhd and #spd son. It was the first day he hasn't had a meltdown. I am not sure if it is a coincidence. I want to try more! #natural #cbdoil #cbd #alternativemedicine #essentialoils #mommyblogger #crunchymom
9100 2018-02-21 03:17:35 Nah. That'd be a waste. I'd rather see someone take a rusted cheese grater doused in serrano pepper oil to his genitals

9103 2018-02-21 03:17:06 Watch out for 97 on the Oil 
9104 2018-02-21 03:17:06 Just because your skin TYPE is determined mostly by of genetics does not mean give up or slack off on taking care of your skin.

A good skin care regimen is the difference between you having oily, problematic skin & you knowing how to control that oil and nip breakouts in the bud
9105 2018-02-21 03:16:50 i prefer oil balancing maybe sebab i pakai yang light tu rasa lambat absorb & melekit tapi okay 
9106 2018-02-21 03:16:47 I recommend swimmers ear and a busted eardrum to absolutely no one. No sleep. Pus. Absolutely no relief - ever. No one takes it seriously. Mike was up at 3am pouring hot olive oil in my ear in desperation. People just don’t know. Ear infections are pure misery.

9117 2018-02-21 03:15:53 Norway had strong institutions and a high wage economy even separate from its oil sector. Can Wakanda adjust from a low-cost vibranium economy to a high-cost vibranium economy? Will businesses untethered to vibranium extraction be able to compete on the world market?
9118 2018-02-21 03:15:52 Just drowned my eyebrows & eyelashes in castor oil. I’ll update y’all in 2 months. My eyebrows better look like caterpillars and my lashes better be as long as granddaddy long legs

9121 2018-02-21 03:15:24 *Actually*, monarchies are more stable than other non-democratic regimes, & have lower levels of political violence & armed conflict even in the presence of natural resources (predominantly oil). Id be more concerned if it was a one-party dictatorship or a military junta.
9122 2018-02-21 03:15:16 Should see what I said to her
9123 2018-02-21 03:15:10 Used motor oil can work in a pinch!!!  
9124 2018-02-21 03:15:07 The anti pipeline movement has won in Canada. It’s over. Investment has left. Engineers are leaving. World consumes record qty of oil/gas

9131 2018-02-21 03:14:08 We could lead the way if we did what the US has done and export oil/gas while producing records and consuming less at home. Profits invested
9132 2018-02-21 03:13:54 We've subjugated ourselves to the inefficiency of federal agencies when the truth is this monster should have and could have been handled at the local level.  Return the power to the locals and the shit stops.

9134 2018-02-21 03:13:37 I asked to a close farmer family the reasons for about their having dinners so early before the sun set? He said just to save money spent on costly kerosene oil.However other said about them otherwise as in misery they do so as well their so life style to purchase lands./1

9140 2018-02-21 03:13:01 Seems like a good reason to do all we can to protect the environment, and support clean and renewable energy, while reducing our dependence on coal and oil, we only have one 
9141 2018-02-21 03:13:00 Canada forced to give its oil away to US who exports it for large margin and invests in renewable for future energy leadership. Smart!
9142 2018-02-21 03:12:47 Money and oil.
9143 2018-02-21 03:12:43 I appreciate you providing the article thank you. But it seems a bit unfair to say that oil companies not responsible for externalizers costs is a subsidy! “These externalized costs include impacts like traffic accidents, carbon emissions, air pollution and road congestion.”

9150 2018-02-21 03:10:50 My self care routine is that one time a month I remember to moisturize with the trader joes coconut oil I bought last march
9151 2018-02-21 03:10:46 This is part of the problem. Alberta had a window of opportunity, pre-shale, but the oil and pipeline industry armed its opponents by sneering at "eco-terrorists" and generally acting arrogant and entitled. I remember stacked-up pipe on the US side of KXL before approvals.
9152 2018-02-21 03:10:43 does he know about the benefits and versatility of coconut oil?
9153 2018-02-21 03:10:40 Vegetable oil. Just spill it and let's see dogrobot prance across that....

9159 2018-02-21 03:09:55 The demand for oil has been growing for the past ten years but it has only reached our pipeline capacity in the last two years. All of Alberta’s pipelines are tapped out. The NDP/lib’s are the gov’t in power now . If they can’t get it done then get the hell out of the way.
9160 2018-02-21 03:09:43 At the end of the day, almost everything we hear about VZ is propaganda. We can't be sure of anything.

We never hear about the massive poverty reduction prior to the oil price collapse, or the covert economic war being waged by US & VZ private sector.

The price of natural gas and oil are falling, but world-wide production is nearing all-time highs. Unfortunately that means more methane.
9210 2018-02-21 03:03:08 Nope.  I only came in halfway into the story anyway, but was rather dismayed at the adversarial tone of the tweet.  So I tried to pour some oil* on the troubled waters. *vegetable oil, of course.

9229 2018-02-21 03:00:15 The demand for AB oil is still there regardless. Whatever we don't export benefits other countries. Period. May and others like her work AGAINST Canada.

9232 2018-02-21 03:00:09 What sort of motor oil does Baron Corbin put in his hair?
9233 2018-02-21 03:00:04 We will take it #LetsGoOilers and I'm sure he thought it was pretty good.

9235 2018-02-21 02:59:46 Hopefully they’ve fixed their oil pressure problems.
9236 2018-02-21 02:59:38 Now we'll see how Bonnie and Kristi adapt to their new environment. Hope that Kim and Bonnie maintain peaceful coexistence. They tend to be oil and water!

9240 2018-02-21 02:59:06 Flashback to Ovechkin w/Boudreau+Hunter as a player who refused to play for the team, or play in his end.  Reverted under Trotz,but nobody would strip him of arguably a top 5 g-scorer in history because of it.  Hall has more pts during his 19gm streak than the Oil do as a team

9243 2018-02-21 02:58:36 Mr Price on your show the other night speaking with @PaulFletcherMP you said the oil refinery had closed, not true, it's actually expanding

9289 2018-02-21 02:52:34 I'd ask him how he likes the feeling of being stuck in a traffic jam.  Besides, he's getting an 75-80% free ride as gasoline prices do not reflect the costs of climate change and the wars the USA has fought to protect access to cheap oil.

9293 2018-02-21 02:51:55 And you call yourself an American? If you cannot support the oil companies appropriately you’ll lose your voting rights! What will you tell your family?
9294 2018-02-21 02:51:49 Hmm they get immune soon. Try cloves and camphor. For bugs, neem oil works best too

9306 2018-02-21 02:50:19 What did he say?
9307 2018-02-21 02:50:10 Venezuela is a pseudo dictatorship.  With enough oil to solve all its problems....if the people owned it do you think the poverty rate would be lover 85%.  Or there would be such extreme inflation?
9308 2018-02-21 02:50:09 Oil ba therathum Ka hun.
9309 2018-02-21 02:50:04 Because having a car people line up for it to see nowadays is way different than 3-4 decades ago when the industry was blooming and everyone lined up for the new models. In the oil industrialized era of cars, one manufacturer accomplishing that is a big deal.
9310 2018-02-21 02:50:01 Today the guy that was changing my oil called me Darlin’, and it reminded me of my auntie. She calls everyone that and I always think it’s so cute 
9311 2018-02-21 02:49:59 I agree with you, we all know of the US atrocities. I was talking about domestic affairs since VZ doesnt have international relevance beyond oil. And comparing the power of both countries and the number of state tools of oppression, Maduro is giving a class of totalitarism
9312 2018-02-21 02:49:54 Like Charles Lindbergh, Henry Ford and Standard Oil?  Those flaming liberals?
9313 2018-02-21 02:49:52 They say will hit the price of barrel of oil

9324 2018-02-21 02:48:40 Salads are great but the dressings can be VERY high in calories & fat. Choose olive oil & lemon.
9325 2018-02-21 02:48:34 It’s only 1 way so far like usual. I saw draisaitl get whacked harder in the o zone on that 4 on 4 and it wasn’t called. Again whatever it is the refs and the oil and reviews don’t mix.
9326 2018-02-21 02:48:29 Yeah, I can see that. I have settled on Niacinamide as a serum/acid and a mix of the face cream and a few drops of argan oil for moisturizer. I like that it’s cheap enough to experiment.
9327 2018-02-21 02:48:26 How does one go and get their oil changed

9331 2018-02-21 02:47:57 BUT ALSO, can anyone believe that I was ballsy enough to travel Europe for 16 days? Me? The girl who needs someone to hold her hand to get an oil change!? WHAT EVEN. I am a fricken rockstar!!!!! That’s all, goodnight
9332 2018-02-21 02:47:55 So you are saying tax payers should subsidize the oil and gas industry even more than the current $4 billion?
9333 2018-02-21 02:47:51 Yes. About it being kinky with the handcuffs and the oil lol.
9334 2018-02-21 02:47:48 oil? watercolour?
9335 2018-02-21 02:47:45 My biggest takeaway of the Versace American Crime Story is how sweaty everyone is in Miami. That or everyone is covered in baby oil. Either way, I am distracted by the shine.
9336 2018-02-21 02:47:43 Wow. Olive oil greatly diminishes scars. Do you remember the incident?
9337 2018-02-21 02:47:20 Lol perfect description! lol. I want to ride one of those food trucks one day lol haven't been on one before but I've been on oil platforms if that counts Lol
9338 2018-02-21 02:47:01 Since I love baseball, I’ll simply say that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure!  Let’s keep it real...BP spills oil & destroys oceans. Samsung builds phones that are ticking time bombs. These companies have faced less scrutiny in PGH than the Bucs!
9339 2018-02-21 02:46:52 Jesus fuck. She complains because I got oil for my hands because they're fucking raw and bleeding because I juiced her god damn lemons?
9340 2018-02-21 02:46:47 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9341 2018-02-21 02:46:41 True. I am slowly getting rid of them too. I use camphor or nilgiri oil to mix with water used for mopping. Keeps insects away.
9342 2018-02-21 02:46:37 If you're bearish oil - for the multitude of supply side factors - the technicals seem to be lining up for a second chance at selling it.  Throw in a $ bounce ?
9343 2018-02-21 02:46:30 Speaking of gross. Flip on over to Sportsnet for the old Oil game. You can listen to Drew talk about how good they are cause they are up 1-0. But being out shot 20-3. #brutal
9344 2018-02-21 02:46:23 BP complaining that the war on plastic pollution may affect oil production but what they mean is profit reduction. Not feeling any sympathy.
9345 2018-02-21 02:46:07 If he asks you to change his oil when you do yours, it’s gonna be on.
9346 2018-02-21 02:46:06 As I understand it, it is people owned oil. Supposedly it is a birth right, I do not know the details though.

9348 2018-02-21 02:45:46 for instance, we could be selling oil at FULL price if energy east and northern gateway were built, instead of massively discounted to the US because the Fed Govt did not support those options
9349 2018-02-21 02:45:45 They should be covered in oil as well
9350 2018-02-21 02:45:43 Strome.  Oil, 1-0.  Only third shot on net for EDM.  Bruins with 13.  Hockey.

9360 2018-02-21 02:44:20 This would make a beautiful oil painting.
9361 2018-02-21 02:44:19 The canvas used for sails on early sailing ships was made from cannabis aka hemp as were ropes and BTW Hebrew "qaneh-bosm" appears frequently in Old Testament translated as sweet cane, calamus and spikenard i.e. the key psychoactive ingredient in anointing oil and church incense!
9362 2018-02-21 02:44:12 Hmmm.  Oil score first.  Is that the first time this year?
9363 2018-02-21 02:44:11 Not gonna lie, he offered to oil us up. We took up the offer.  Video coming soon to pornhub...gross.
9364 2018-02-21 02:44:10 Or that time they were tied up on the garage and that comment he made about the oil 
9365 2018-02-21 02:44:05 Oil score first for the 22nd time!

9374 2018-02-21 02:43:06 I forgot to oil my hair last night so I couldn’t wash it today so therefore I couldn’t do my hair and I look like a little kid  currently oiling my hair to wash tomorrow

9376 2018-02-21 02:42:56 You see it's like this: we know we're good, but those people over there we don't know them so we can't be sure about them. So it's best to get them to be like us. Or else. Especially when for some reason they have OUR oil or OUR opium.

9381 2018-02-21 02:42:32 One club found in 2008 and other was already top club of the world. Oil money came suddenly  
2nd tier club looked for empty seats to be filled.

9390 2018-02-21 02:41:18 I used a new mousse today... turns out it's made with almond oil. I only found this out AFTER breaking out into hives... 
9391 2018-02-21 02:40:38 Tbh, Hall is to Ref Th as oil is to water. He is really more an IFB bordering on KJVOyist kind of secondary seperation madness. Whatever the disagreement is on the term "Reformed Baptist" is, don't give it up to a hyper-Calvinist troll like Hall. He's not worthy of it. My .02.

9395 2018-02-21 02:40:15 Shut up you weirdooooo, if that is the case then all of the money that is give to politicians has to go as well like Pharmaceutical, car manufacturers, and oil companies. So shut your pie hole!!! Fuck you people are idiots.
9396 2018-02-21 02:40:14 my oil painting class was cancelled so i went to this poetry writing workshop and it wasn't too bad i finally shared something i wrote

9398 2018-02-21 02:40:01 I swear apple cider vinegar is the new coconut oil
9399 2018-02-21 02:39:53 Oil changes are covered under car insurance?!
9400 2018-02-21 02:39:52 So I tried some of the Maui moisture line. I picked up the heal/hydrate leave in, the smooth and repair hair butter, the curl quench smoothie and the coconut oil weightless mist. I think I put too much of the mist in my hair because my hair kinda greasy feeling though lol
9401 2018-02-21 02:39:36 I have a substance abuse problem. It's called bread! Was staple of my forefathers for many generations. Bread, feta cheese, olive oil, olives, fruits, whole grains, veggies, a bit of fish and rarely a sheep or a goat. I don't do goat but I am happy with the rest of the diet.
9402 2018-02-21 02:39:36 ろるしてえ！最近はjgもやるようになったのですよ
9403 2018-02-21 02:39:27 I'm pretty sure the deficit is due to those 'welfare queens' Big Oil, Big Pharma, & Big Business, and this nation does spend too much protecting 'wildlife'-the Bulls & Bears of Wall Street, payday loan Sharks, & the bloated whale MIC. & leeches like NRA, sports stadiums...
9404 2018-02-21 02:39:24 ROFLMAO  She is like a drip of oil coming out of a can...
9405 2018-02-21 02:39:24 Does this coward hide under his bed while counting all his cash from the oil, gas and coal lobby?
9406 2018-02-21 02:39:20 Mine came on right after oil change when they also changed air filter and didnt click the box closed properly.
9407 2018-02-21 02:39:20 not sure what you are trying to illustrate here.. speculators unwinding their long positions here.  Oil sale and management is a provincial responsibility. Pricing is market...
9408 2018-02-21 02:39:16 Yes. Grain shipping is starting to lag behind. They claim its the weather but obviously there is more money in shipping oil than grain. What a shame.

9411 2018-02-21 02:38:32 With corrupt oil money you plastic mugs!.
9412 2018-02-21 02:38:00 i cooked a whole ass meal for my family and they’re mad cause i lost the cap for the olive oil
9413 2018-02-21 02:38:00 itching cracked skin between my toes so i googled "home remedies for Athlete's foot" & tea tree oil popped up & aha, I have that! so I rubbed it all over my feet then returned to see the recommendation ends with "People should not use undiluted tea tree oil on their skin." oh.
9414 2018-02-21 02:37:55 Efficascent oil extra strength!
9415 2018-02-21 02:37:25 The rise of healthcare as an employment perk screwed things up horribly. Imagine what oil change would cost if your employer covered the insurance for your non-company vehicle.
9416 2018-02-21 02:37:12 try using the oil blot sheet things too! they work pretty well (:
9417 2018-02-21 02:37:08 My mom uses baby oil 
9418 2018-02-21 02:37:02 I feel like the oil will be most effective in this particular challenge. #TheChallengeVendettas
9419 2018-02-21 02:36:41 If a cop pulls into the gas station lot while you are fueling and you do the following, yes you have caught my attention...

*See squad and make awkward eye contact
*Wash ENTIRE car with windshield cleaner
*Check oil
*Check tires
*Go in store x5

9424 2018-02-21 02:36:03 Facial oil before or after moisturizer? I keep getting different answers from different people. @elleleary @thataylaa @NikkiaJoyy
9425 2018-02-21 02:36:00 (olive oil, 2 bay leaves and salt while boiling )
9426 2018-02-21 02:35:51 It would lower it more then 1 degree if more countries started switching and cleaning up the planet. But they don't and just expect the world to clean itself up. Well it isn't gonna and things are just gonna get worse if coal and oil are continued to be used en mass.
9427 2018-02-21 02:35:47 True. FSU doesn’t have the best history w/ coaches especially assistants. But that oil money don’t play. Not too mention, they wrote a damn $10.4 million check for Sumlin to go #stupidmoney

9429 2018-02-21 02:35:41 As for supplements - I just take D + K. Creatine is good, but too lazy. I eat smoked salmon so no need for fish oil. Curcumin and cissus likely good because of my busted up joints, but again... too lazy.
9430 2018-02-21 02:35:37 Call me a conspiracy nut,  but i have been convinced of russias guilt in 911 since 912
It was to cover up the oil for nukes deal he was making with saddam and America had to cover putins involvement or American citizens would demand nuclear war
People are beginning to believe me
9431 2018-02-21 02:35:36 Yes!!!! It’s a must! What do you use the almond oil for?
9432 2018-02-21 02:35:33 As long as it is surrounded with citronella plants & I am saturated in citronella oil it will work. Mosquitoes love my blood

9434 2018-02-21 02:35:27 No he's using the time he's on top of his own little world to piss on the Oilers when they are down. So basically showing what an immature little shit he is. Some things never change. He whines, his loyal media following defends it. Good job!
9435 2018-02-21 02:35:26 Trying out this plantar fasciitis oil blend. Fingers crossed it helps. My feet hurt so much by the end of the day.
9436 2018-02-21 02:35:21 Water + Coconut Oil = Happiness

9438 2018-02-21 02:35:00 Coconut oil. Is there anything this stuff can't do? Just moisturized with some and oh yeah this is nice.
9439 2018-02-21 02:34:50 We had a chance to be allies with Russia before we thought we needed to oust Assad so the oilygarchs could steal Syria's oil.
9440 2018-02-21 02:34:48 I don't have many specifics (I follow too much to remember all) but I remember getting quite outraged by the [oil? gas?] deal that Turkey struck with Israel at the exact time it was also posturing publicly about Mavi Marmara (last part was of course correct).
9441 2018-02-21 02:34:47 She ain’t use olive oil or nothing 
9442 2018-02-21 02:34:43 You're standing up for Alberta's oil industry and that's the conservatives thing and ONLY thing! You're stealing their thunder! 
9443 2018-02-21 02:34:16 Someone on the life hacks Snapchat just used canola oil kitchen spray in place of tanning oil 
9444 2018-02-21 02:34:16 I also try not to buy tuna from the same place I buy motor oil.  #POstables
9445 2018-02-21 02:34:08 Season the shrimp with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic, paprika, olive oil and lemon. Smoke for 10-15 minutes. For the quinoa, season liquid with chicken stock and garlic. Simmer for 15 minutes.

9451 2018-02-21 02:33:32 Hmmm... bummer. Did they see all the loaded and embedded roach sticky traps? Well, I know it’s a problem so maybe just delicately try and keep pressure on them. Squeaky wheel gets the oil.

And they say the Oil are having some issues on the PK? You don't say...
9454 2018-02-21 02:33:10 imagine if all of the donations to marching were given to a fund to provide armed security and metal detectors to poor schools and other schools without much tax revenue. would actually be doing something for security for students.

9456 2018-02-21 02:32:48 I could do it they take time and are painted with oil based enamel paint. $250 they are hard to do but will last a lifetime. Everyone I do will be one of a kind. Im basing the price on the last one I sold to a private buyer.

9458 2018-02-21 02:32:25 Something I do to avoid tangles or to prevent the tangles from ruining the wig is Motion Oil Sheen Spray, usually comes in a gold can it’s really helpful and makes the wigs smell and look nice
9459 2018-02-21 02:32:25 Energy production is not a jobs program. The fact it takes more people to provide for 1% of our energy consumption than it takes to provide for 52% (67% if imported oil is included) is not a positive aspect of renewable energy.
9460 2018-02-21 02:32:12 Porque no son empresas de energía sino "petroleras". YPF, Bulgheroni, Shell, OIL. No tienen cultura renovable, se aferran a lo que conocen y quieren estirar el ciclo de vida.
9461 2018-02-21 02:32:07 Does anyone else use milk instead of water and butter instead of oil while making a cake?
9462 2018-02-21 02:31:52 P.S add salt before the olive oil. Enough to your liking.
9463 2018-02-21 02:31:43 ネキちゃん絶対可愛いので可愛い
9464 2018-02-21 02:31:32 This is precisely why people of the leftist dogma, can’t be taken seriously. Their opinions are like feathers in the wind. They flutter whimsically, and change direction at the slightest gust.
9465 2018-02-21 02:31:32 Even if @foxandfriends explained hacking 2 @realDonaldTrump #DotardDon couldn't understand. He really isn't intelligent at all! He's not acting, putting on, or pretending. He is as ignorant as oil is greasy.

9467 2018-02-21 02:31:06 Which is why I mentioned oil prices, as long as they remain high, Govt intervention is a moot point
9468 2018-02-21 02:30:48 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!

9473 2018-02-21 02:30:00 Get you an arugula salad.  Massage some kale with olive oil the night before to moisturize your hands and have softer kale.  Blitz some carrots for carrot salad with golden raisins and walnuts?
9474 2018-02-21 02:29:52 Stove top rice for 2: 2 cups of rice. For every cup, add 1 and 1/2 of water. Add about a cap full of olive oil. Leave on 5 or medium until it begins to bubble. Once water evaporates and you see AIR POCKETS, stir, cover, and lower temp to 1 or low for 15 mins. Stir and serve.
9475 2018-02-21 02:29:28 I was told by the therapist who helped me adapt my home so I can cook that she doubted anyone would hire me.  I wouldn't even get hired as a receptionist.  If they want to get people off of disability, allow them to go back to school.  I had carpal tunnel and still worked.
9476 2018-02-21 02:29:27 What massage oil would you recommend preferably anything that doesn’t involve lavender
9477 2018-02-21 02:29:15 Wendy needs an oil change and a plumber..
9478 2018-02-21 02:29:04 Yeah, & we are responsible for that. 

All in the name of keeping the Iranian oil fields in private hands.
9479 2018-02-21 02:28:51 JOSIE MARAN Argan Black Oil Mascara / from sephora (don’t let the word oil scare you). it can clump but if you apply slow & precise, it’s amazing.

9487 2018-02-21 02:28:00 Daj came over earlier so I could change the oil in her car. She said she looked like “death with bed head” but to me it was perfection.
9488 2018-02-21 02:27:55 We can either supply the oil or let them keep using coal.  It's a trade off that benefits all. Even most of our electrical comes from fossil fuels and by scientific estimates will still be in the lead In 2050 even if Paris accord targets are met.
9489 2018-02-21 02:27:21 Don't get too excited, buying oil from US is just a political compulsion. India is only trying hard to close with US like any other country.
9490 2018-02-21 02:27:16 I think she’s talking about the old fist of truth.
9491 2018-02-21 02:27:16 Almond oil; it’s great to lather on right after a shower, natural soaps (I love Dr. Bronner castile soaps) drink plenty of water and cortisone (the ointment). Also watch what you eat. Your skin is a reflection of what you put inside so stay away from milk.
9492 2018-02-21 02:27:14 Be persistent and have tangible realistic goals.

Anyone can succeed at this career, and Dan has it right, start by doing a part time job and pursuing your passions. I did. I worked at a mall for 2 years and at a car shop changing oil for 9 hours a day to pay rent and food.
9493 2018-02-21 02:27:05 But maybe not for oil
9494 2018-02-21 02:26:56 OPEC and Russia could careless what happens in Canada. Yes we need pipelines, but on the other hand, Canada cannot compete with OPEC, Russia, or the United States when it comes to oil production. Once Saudi Aramco goes public the market will be flooded again.

9503 2018-02-21 02:24:54 Hoarders, wreckers, and kulaks fucking up your socialist utopia, comrade? Nationalizing the means of production have nothing to do with the collapse of their oil industry? Do tell.
9504 2018-02-21 02:24:43 They're masters of the long game. They know the electric car revolution is coming and will kill their only economy - oil. They've been working for a decade to sow descent globally to slow that tide. If it sparks war that spikes oil prices, all the better.

9510 2018-02-21 02:24:08 Also, there are about 17,000 oil tanker movements off the Canadian Atlantic coast, 85% of all tanker movements in Canada, yet we just don’t hear about this. Seems strange the focus is on the Pacific coast, when so much more & could make a bigger difference on Atlantic coast.
9511 2018-02-21 02:24:05 Now then, who’s selling this oil?  Seems some very shitty business men. Or some very shitty oil.

9514 2018-02-21 02:23:52 Absolutely! While in elementary school, I loved to make origami crafts by simply Youtubing "how-to" videos! It's also how I learned to change the oil in my car! I was way more successful at making paper crafts then the oil change though! :D #DitchEDU

9516 2018-02-21 02:23:37 Lavender oil in the diffuser for the night. Let’s see if this gives me a deep slumber. 
9517 2018-02-21 02:23:18 That might be in some financial  reports but it obvously promotes their fossil fuel industry. Russia has a billions of gallons of oil  it sells to Europe etc and would likely be enriched and empowered by global warming given its large permafrost area.
9518 2018-02-21 02:23:12 So....you flex your oil saturated muscles...so tough.  but then Sub-Zero freezes the shit out of you.  “Didn’t see that coming”. #fuckyou
9519 2018-02-21 02:23:04 oh you’re a thrillseeker... well have you ever made your own clove oil coconut oil ear drops to soothe an earache?
yeah didn’t think so.... 
9520 2018-02-21 02:22:53 My question was more about butter+oil in coffee than the brand itself.
9521 2018-02-21 02:22:51 Such masterful technique, sliding in there with no effort. Did Luke oil himself up?
9522 2018-02-21 02:22:34 Strong arguments could be made for 3. Chemistry - inventing the element, Physics - renewable energy, Peace - no more fighting over oil and energy.

9525 2018-02-21 02:22:14 I need a new engine oil pump and my wife needs a new starter. Ugh. Lots of money. Debating whether to do the starter myself to save $200-300 on labor.

9530 2018-02-21 02:21:26 The last legislation proposed to do this was very loosely worded, and arguably could have made whole classes of firearms illegal. It prohibited "anything that increased the rate of fire." So would gun oil be banned? How about triggers themselves?
9531 2018-02-21 02:21:20 If you really think about it, selling public lands for mining and drilling is like giving the land to foreign powers. They end up with the oil and minerals and Americans get the shaft.

9536 2018-02-21 02:20:40 Mitch McConnell being paid $1.3 million by the oil and gas lobby after the US left the Paris Agreement is not legitimate political activity. That’s not even government, it’s effectively the international relations wing of whoever had the most resources first to buy it.
9537 2018-02-21 02:20:40 2 hrs ago I said thinking about my hair was draining. I eventually got up, and did a hot oil treatment........... it’s still sitting in my head.
9538 2018-02-21 02:20:33 going 2 see austin richard post in the flesh i could dip my whole arm into hot frying oil rn and would still be smiling happy as a damn clam brother

9540 2018-02-21 02:20:24 Of course they are. You said oil wouldn't be extracted without subsidies, but those subsidies are minuscule relative to the economic value of energy-dense fossil fuels.

9546 2018-02-21 02:19:46 "[Obama] did little more than shrug when Crimea was annexed" is a ludicrous lie. He imposed the toughest sanctions ever visited on the Russian Federation, pushing it further into economic trouble caused by low oil prices.
9547 2018-02-21 02:19:40 covers my immediate instinct upon being such a cfp about a bucketload. Olive or grape seed oil work
9548 2018-02-21 02:19:38 The key to helping cook a big family dinner is to stand near the action, listen for keywords being talked about like "olive oil" and have it ready when people turn around. After that it's all the Twitter you can handle
9549 2018-02-21 02:19:29 Pure Madness. You should put reader discretion on this can of new time pls, a country that has crude oil

9569 2018-02-21 02:16:36 Can anyone tell me in what currency that Russia is paid for its oil?  Is it the US dollar, is it a basket of currencies?

Alternatively, where would I look for this info?
@EnergyPhilFlynn
9570 2018-02-21 02:16:22 I've heard that Trump's infrastructure plan calls for opening up any national park to oil and gas exploration under the guise of addressing the backlog of maintenance issues within the parks, thereby bypassing all Congressional and regulatory requirements. We can't allow that!
9571 2018-02-21 02:16:21 He died in an illegal war for oil. 
He wasted his life. We need not waste ours.

Just because the Oil are all you care about doesn’t mean Edmonton is the make-or-break for his legacy  We let him down, too.

9591 2018-02-21 02:14:02 My risk taking with eating left overs needs to stop. I’m too busy to be stressed out on whether I’m going to have an oil spill or not.
9592 2018-02-21 02:13:55 It would be very interesting to see a comparison between this, and the actual physical settlement of crude oil futures. Like, if I don’t sell my oil futures before expiration, does a truck show up at my doorstep to drop off barrels of crude?
9593 2018-02-21 02:13:54 Friedman has been wrong on so many issues. According to him we would be out of oil by now. It is always doom and gloom. He is just a book pusher.
9594 2018-02-21 02:13:50 Venezuela is starting a new currency you probably know that tho , looks like a good stick and move moment and their gonna do it with their oil as backing

9597 2018-02-21 02:13:39 There's not much difference between oil extraction and kidnapping, murdering, bombing, and narcotrafficking (and all the crimes associated with the latter?). Come on Chris, you know that's BS.
9598 2018-02-21 02:13:35 Let’s face it. Without oil sales all Canadians suffer. Premier Notley, Alberta needs to diversify. That’s a given. But we also need markets for our oil. Stay focussed. Stand firm towards B.C.
9599 2018-02-21 02:13:35 But they can be defeated. There are more normal regular honest people in the US. The GOP just has a lot of oil and gun money but it will run out one day.
9600 2018-02-21 02:13:19 I dropped a pallet of oil that probably cost a hot 50k+ today, only one case busted. There is a god.
9601 2018-02-21 02:13:15 So a crypto currency launch by the state of Venezuela, where internet is scarce, supposedly won't be influenced by politics, and backed by oil that no individual can really get a hold of...what could go wrong? @SkyCorridors please make a song about this "achievement."

9614 2018-02-21 02:11:23 I estimate RON95 price to go down in the range of 5 - 7 cents. This is of course because of CNY and also GE which is just around the corner. UMNO is so powerful that they can control internationally traded crude oil prices &  MOPS product price movement. Apa lagi cina mau?

9618 2018-02-21 02:10:59 Taking your response at face value... The moral difference between buying influence with coke $$ or that from oil and extraction industries is perhaps not that great.

9624 2018-02-21 02:10:06 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
9625 2018-02-21 02:09:58 My proposal would bring home our troops, and the non direct subsidies of our defence of resources on for lands. The market would adjust to changing oil prices, and the green economy may take off on its own
9626 2018-02-21 02:09:56 Yes you are correct. Products we use are made of oil. Not new information but an old argument. Why is being progressive and tying to evolve into a  more sustainable society so awful for you.
9627 2018-02-21 02:09:48 Come on now you still owe me a couple favs remember when I gave u that oil? Came all the way to the north to change your tire? I think I deserve it

9638 2018-02-21 02:08:21 Roughly 25% of state tax revenue comes from oil/gas. That economic downturn has been crushing to the state. To help that industry the legislation lowered the tax rate thinking the downturn would not last long. Not smart.

9641 2018-02-21 02:08:02 Also not true. However, the US is not engaged in imperialism, it's engaging in hegemony. They're similar. Imperialism is generally about obtaining resources in some form or another. The US's goal is actually about check mating the USSR and later about obtaining oil.

9656 2018-02-21 02:06:32 Oh no!!! I was the same way for awhile, Rosacea and all but finally detoxed it enough to oil cleanse and also moisturize. I can’t use anything else to cleanse my face now except in an extreme situation I CAN use the non soapy cetaphil.
9657 2018-02-21 02:06:23 We also don’t care what some snake oil salesman from a certified hate group has to say.

9669 2018-02-21 02:04:26 Eventually, oil and gas will push through to the surface naturally.  We have very few “disasters”, compared to the disasters the EPA creates.  Honestly do some research and you will see the EPA is actually worse for the environment than the oil companies.

9673 2018-02-21 02:03:41 Since @POTUS opened ANWR for Oil and Gas development, I bet the Russians are now butting in as they claim the Arctic as their territory, and may try to challenge us there. If we bring in the Canadians, they bring in the British & Dutch Oil interests as well. With Norway as well.

my verdict: buyers

yzerman could be active to acquire a dman before the trade deadline as they look to go all in this year. the lightning have been leaking oil as of late and an acquisition could be a shot in the arm.

9705 2018-02-21 02:00:02 Put on some pure coconut oil before and after you shave , it softens the hairs and makes the skin less irritated. Also baby oil gel is perfect for shaving that area and make sure you use a clean razor each time .

I actually make my own sometimes, and buy raw materials like argan oil, bioactives, and essential oils/floral hydrosols. That adds up $
9720 2018-02-21 01:57:30 i have had it before just not often. often enough to know the distinct taste. Like I can tell if they possibly mixed oil with chicken or they were sitting next to chicken

9725 2018-02-21 01:57:09 The bitumen being shipped to Asia is not refined. Those are Canadian jobs being exported!! The pipeline Alberta wants built is exporting jobs. My original tweet was in response to your statement that we have to import oil as if that has anything to do with the pl not being built
9726 2018-02-21 01:57:01 I'm from a province who has been known as 'redneck'.

Never would I see promoting lies on Twitter about young survivors in Florida
9727 2018-02-21 01:56:52 Yeah, it was really gruesome. Kid had been acting weird, making strange videos, running traffic lights saying he was invincible, eating cheese with cooking oil poured over it, then he snapped. Freaky scary. I heard no drugs either.

9738 2018-02-21 01:56:08 Yeah, it's bad that he won't verbally berate Putin, but no big deal that he had approved defensive arms to Ukraine and Poland, lessened our dependence on Russian oil, and taken out hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria. So we need tough words, not actions. Is that right?

9746 2018-02-21 01:54:56 So I always have my models put on coconut oil for their pictures right. I hate wasting oil so I used to rub it in my hair to soak it up.
Now they have me literally putting it on every time I shower. 
I think I put too much on because I feel like I'm slippery af right now 
9747 2018-02-21 01:54:55 So besides pipelines how should bc get their oil or should oil just be abolished completely in bc?
9748 2018-02-21 01:54:43 Whoever owns that will break it up and sell it off to diff govs, oil companies etc..In order to prevent everyone from having to build their own pipelines on the ocean floor to get the oil out they will work as a team and share one pipeline that might have 20 rigs flowing to it3/5
9749 2018-02-21 01:54:41 Say an oil tanker with 80 million gallons of diluted bitumen sinks off BC's coast, destroying BC's economy and environment. Who pays to clean it up? Alberta? nope.  Federal Govt? Nope. Kinder? Well Kinder will blame the tanker. Tanker company can't afford 20-50billion clean up...
9750 2018-02-21 01:54:37 So you avoid coconut oil?
9751 2018-02-21 01:54:13 The bill has something in it called unization (sp?) which 
Would prevent US oil companies from working not only in in Russia but also around the world. For instance...they find  a big field in the middle of the ocean.  2/5

9757 2018-02-21 01:52:53 One has to wonder if there aren't some self interested American oil refiners who are doing their best to prevent Canadian oil from getting to tide water. Koch brothers perhaps?
9758 2018-02-21 01:52:40 Probably didn't mentioned the fact that during 2004-2012 (and to a lesser extent, today) the govt used the oil checkbook to buy influence in the region, selling cheap oil to be paid in 40years even.

Y'know, money the country kinda needs now.

Do carbon emissions from the potential increased output in the oil sands actually equal half of all vehicle and airline travel in Canada?

9790 2018-02-21 01:49:48 Bring me some wine and no foot rub for me, I just got home from work and JP is at an oil spill

9793 2018-02-21 01:49:41 It was basically held up by oil, when oil ran out it just flopped, also talked about people literally eating garbage
9794 2018-02-21 01:49:35 I’m trying my new lavender oil diffuser which means I’m going to bed earlier than usual tonight lol
9795 2018-02-21 01:49:34 I did the exact same thing. After >10 years of spending summers in BC I’m excited to head to sandpoint. If our oil & gas isn’t good enough for B.C. then the money I make off of it isn’t good enough for them either.
9796 2018-02-21 01:49:33 That is why you shouldn't say someone can't be disabled just because they don't look sick.  Sure some scam the system, but until you can crawl in their body and feel how they feel, you just shouldn't assume.
9797 2018-02-21 01:49:30 Greeley residents have expressed concerns to council member Suniga about oil drilling areas #greeleygov
9798 2018-02-21 01:49:25 Suniga asked for health and safety checks to be made for areas surrounding oil drilling sites.
@greeleygov

9800 2018-02-21 01:49:13 Councilwoman @StacySuniga rose her concerns about oil drilling in Ward II. She asks of her fellow council members "let's discuss this"

9804 2018-02-21 01:48:50 Who pays for the clean up if there's an oil spill? Enbridge announced the cost of the Kalamazoo oil spill cleanup reached about $700 million.
9805 2018-02-21 01:48:32 If i wash my hair, as in fully wash it not just a co-wash AND put rollers in my hair plus take the time to add oil and gel to my setting lotion so the style can hold; I’m not leaving the house until the next day. Sorry not sorry
9806 2018-02-21 01:48:29 Councilmember Stacy Suniga addressed a response from the Greeley community about oil drilling sites being so close to schools and the concern for families near the area. #greeleygov
9807 2018-02-21 01:48:29 Suniga addressed school areas under the council's jurisdiction. Suniga said that she understands that oil work creates high wage jobs in Greeley, but there must be a better and safer way to do it for the Greeley community.

9816 2018-02-21 01:47:19 @ableg @abpoli We should remember that AB's govt in 2002 claimed that rejecting the Kyoto Protocol as well as absolute emission reductions were "in Alberta's interest." Not regulating the pace of oil sands dev or taking a fair share of royalties also said to be in our interest.
9817 2018-02-21 01:47:04 It took a century to build the infrastructure to use this much oil.  We cannot afford to switch quickly.  Statements like this show an ignorance about the scale of the mining operations and infrastructure that would be needed.
9818 2018-02-21 01:47:03 At-large council member Stacey Suniga has raising concerns about risk concerns on behalf of ward 2, and construction of oil. @greeleyegov

9820 2018-02-21 01:46:19 @ShWomenstore Seriously? I have been using coconut oil with some of my silicone Tantus toys for well over 2 years now, and they still look as good as new.

9821 2018-02-21 01:46:08 As long as that's all that is allowed otherwise you're going to get into edibles and smoking marijuana all of it will be there to be done so it has to be very careful that it only the oil that they are allowed to take from the medical marijuana at school!!!!

9842 2018-02-21 01:43:59 It only takes one drop of oil dropped in a water supply to contaminate the whole supply. The Russian meddling is the same way.

9845 2018-02-21 01:43:46 Aromatherapy is real. It works, the difference is to get 100 percent essential oils, no blends or other ingredients. It should just be 100 percent pure natural oil.
9846 2018-02-21 01:43:43 Homemade PB&J cups are the bestest thing ever. I’ve eaten the equivalent of a jar of PB and 1/2 jar of coconut oil ain’t with 1/2 jar of grape jelly. #thisiswhyimfat

9849 2018-02-21 01:43:22 It seems insane to believe that the oil drilling, fracking, burning, polluting of billions of ppl on Earth has not had any effect on climate. If the deniers of climate change are right, and we aren't killing the planet, Great!  But I don't wanna bet on it. Stakes are too high.

9853 2018-02-21 01:42:34 I think it is. I did a fair amount of oil field work, and wells sucked dry fill up again. But it's slow. Probably why they want to reduce the population to 500 million.

9873 2018-02-21 01:38:52 The same "fiscal conservatives" who keep voting to extend oil subsidies to oil companies, some of the most profitable companies on the planet, and vote tax cuts for the rich increasing the deficit? Those "fiscal conservatives"? Don't hold your breath.

9878 2018-02-21 01:38:35 Most of the rabid BC opposition I see online to pipelines has nothing to do with ghg, it's tanker traffic and potential spills.  Fact is Canada kneecapping itself by curbing oil production will not prevent demand being made up elsewhere, which is where this arg falls short.
9879 2018-02-21 01:38:20 Which, basically, was what PET was attempting to do in 1981 with his NEP. The American oil companies went ballistic and Albertans backed them up.

9891 2018-02-21 01:36:37 I thought the essential oil Rosemary smelt like a flower. But no it smells like a tree and now my hair smells like a forest, but it’s fine.
9892 2018-02-21 01:36:32 What part is based on "clean growth"? Oil is not very clean. Why don't you refine at home?

9896 2018-02-21 01:35:25 ME-SEEMS, THEY SHOULD OIL THEIR OWN MACHINE. WHAT IS THE INTEREST? SO, YOU WANT HINDUSTAN TO GIVE 5* TREATMENT TO SALEM AS LIKE MALIYA, MODI, NADEEM, ET AL.! LET HIM ROT IN JAIL TILL DEATH………
9897 2018-02-21 01:35:22 When my kids think they’re sick they ask for a ‘placebo pill’ - it’s a magic cure-all pill in our house.

Pharmacologically speaking, it’s half of a tums tablet.

It’s like snake oil, but better. And has calcium.
9898 2018-02-21 01:34:52 Damn! I gotta pay for my oil changes now.
9899 2018-02-21 01:34:48 did they donate or support in any way the fight last summer against the oil pipeline running too close to a water source through the Indian Reservation?
9900 2018-02-21 01:34:33 You have to check it out. Basically it cooks your food with hot air. You can fry whatever you like fried without the oil. It literally fries it with hot air. People cook other things in it as wel. I still have to explore everything I can cook, but I made wings last night...
9901 2018-02-21 01:34:32 When they refuse to leave motels?

9904 2018-02-21 01:34:02 Done an overnight oil treatment on my hair lastnight and my gosh it’s so perfect right now 
9905 2018-02-21 01:33:48 Do you ever just sit and wonder shit like “How many kilograms of oil does an average human’s skin make in its lifetime?”
9906 2018-02-21 01:33:40 u know ur depression is full throttle when u spend stupid dollars at the school store on necessities, such as an oil diffuser and 4 different kinds of moisturizers
9907 2018-02-21 01:33:37 That oil helped us out lol
9908 2018-02-21 01:33:23 The carbon free future is coming. Enjoy some BC wine, or bud, and enjoy the show. Move your investments out of ‘oil’.
9909 2018-02-21 01:33:22 No shit! All oil shipments to B.C. lower mainland should be halted immediately!
9910 2018-02-21 01:33:18 It’s not murder if a gun is used to protect myself against someone trying to murder me.

9912 2018-02-21 01:33:05 Probably. They are very intelligent people.
9913 2018-02-21 01:33:03 Dude, I’ve said guacamole randomly all day...everytime somebody would start touching a bottle of anything...”oh that one has a 45x bronzer, tamanu oil AND guacamole  !!!”
9914 2018-02-21 01:32:51 And that makes them ecoterrorists and the entire Trump cabinet is guilty of trampling the rights of humans.

9920 2018-02-21 01:31:42 Again, Oilers situation is a tad different than most, thanks to the revolving door behind the bench. Eakins experiment set things back a whole bunch with many on the roster, especially since the players wanted Ralph. Never heard McLellan say or even hint a bad word about Hall.

9929 2018-02-21 01:30:48 This was very a valuable advice given to me by one of my seniors at work (law firm). Wanted to go get LLM right after NYSC (Oil &Gas was reigning back then for most of us) Ended up realizing Law was not my real passion. Got a Masters in Creative Writing 5 years later.

9935 2018-02-21 01:30:15 That billboard was made by the NRA to sell more guns. It's interesting the first ones to report it was Russia Times, the NRA's latest big donor.

9938 2018-02-21 01:29:46 KFC have run out of chicken. This is a serious crisis?! The cutting down of the rainforests for palm oil is a crisis. Plastics found polluting our oceans, is a crisis. Refugees escaping war torn countries, that’s definitely a crisis. Not having your chicken? Front page news. Wow.

9942 2018-02-21 01:29:26 I promptly got my car an oil change when I paid it off and a tune up. She is paid off. She needed some love for all of the adventures she safely takes us to. I love her and she loves me. Her name is Terri, Terri the Terrain.

9946 2018-02-21 01:29:13 Depending on what it's paired with it's good. It shouldn't be breaded or put in oil though, just pan fried. Hawaiian friend has shown me all kinds of local dishes they use it in. Love em all so far. 
9947 2018-02-21 01:29:03 I use @WellnessMama 's recipe for coconut oil deodorant, have been using it for years.

9953 2018-02-21 01:27:36 I was watching U-Toob reviews of nacho cheese fries with Daddo.
The reviews all said the fries needed to be crispier than they were.
Not crispy fries means oil not hot enough or fries not cooked long enough.
Either way, yuck.

9955 2018-02-21 01:27:21 Lol it is a fact Like oil tankers it takes a long time to get up to speed a long time to slow it down, the idiot in the White House having a free ride on Obama‘s economy You’ll see how he crash and burns very soon, I know you are so used of lies the truth now hurts if you hear it
9956 2018-02-21 01:26:51 LESS BRAGGING more action. You haven't done anything yet.  Fix our infrastructure.  Make our country CYBER STRONG. Where is our ENERGY PLAN??  Stop importing oil - look this up on google ... give us a HYDROGEN BASED ECONOMY and we'll kick China's ass economically.
9957 2018-02-21 01:26:36 Gaddafi had the misfortune of underestimating the globalist cabal when he made moves to replace the petro-dollar with his own new gold backed currency to purchase oil...

9965 2018-02-21 01:25:24 Not being truthful in the classroom in order to protect big oil, coal and gas interests = educational malpractice
9966 2018-02-21 01:25:15 I took a gentle yoga class that I was so into today. Yes, I want to be touched. Yes, I want a bolster for a heart opener. Yes, I want lavender oil rubbed on my temples. So mellow right now.
9967 2018-02-21 01:25:11 ooof, yeah that'd make it verrrry hard. Lots of coconut + coconut oil though!

9971 2018-02-21 01:24:46 Have you thought about calling it Bombardier Oil, Trump might like that term during the continuing NAFTA negotiations.
9972 2018-02-21 01:24:41 After reading the paper Prof Jaccard kindly linked for me, and reading this thread, I feel like the oil sands critics are 5-10 years out of date. As if producers' commitments to new emissions-lowering technology and innovation are being ignored or not thought to be relevant.
9973 2018-02-21 01:24:24 Oil that is,
9974 2018-02-21 01:24:22 So everybody thought today would be a solid day to get an oil change? Bet.
9975 2018-02-21 01:24:19 ok not to sound like a brat but my coconut oil is not solidified at room temperature because my house is warmer than room temperature rn and I am sad

9977 2018-02-21 01:24:02 Beware of the so-called anointing oil, blessed water, beads from TB Joshua, Bushiri, Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin, and others. These people are nothing but black magicians, occultists in disguise! Don’t let them initiate you into their dark empires!

9979 2018-02-21 01:23:53 It's kind of a derogatory/demeaning term used to refer to black individuals with rlly dark skin, and blick is a combination of "black" and "slick" i think b/c it's like they're so dark they look like oil. The term is fucking disgusting and should never be used tbh :////////////

9983 2018-02-21 01:22:49 The following excerpt from the OCCRP report on Biya shows why he's holding on to #Ambazonia. Our oil revenue is his piggy bank.
"According to the International Monetary Fund, more than $300 million of the revenue of Cameroon’s national oil company in 2017 was not accounted for."
9984 2018-02-21 01:22:35 But I get oil burned anyway
9985 2018-02-21 01:22:35 Yup, looks like Russia down there. Hmmmm you can also see closet racist, pedophiles, oil business tycoons, Fox News and the Koch Bros.
9986 2018-02-21 01:22:29 Phish Oil?
9987 2018-02-21 01:22:18 No, that is Us politics. As they always couch these horrific invasions as being for "the right" and against "enemies," usually Muslims, when they are only doing it to get the elites--the banks, defense companies, oil co's--richer. You're drinking their Kool-Aid and it's sad.
9988 2018-02-21 01:22:15 You mean to tell me some people actually use coconut oil for cooking purposes

9997 2018-02-21 01:20:38 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
9998 2018-02-21 01:20:29 does it count as oil pulling if you use weed oil and swallow it? #askingforafriend
9999 2018-02-21 01:20:22 The smoothness of all of this. Like they mixed Shea and coconut oil.
10000 2018-02-21 01:20:17 While flirting, Jason Chaffetz insists to Jeff Sessions that oil executives are not very smart. An ambassador goes undercover.
