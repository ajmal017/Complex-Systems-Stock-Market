6 2018-03-06 23:59:20 I find CBD oil does help but other than that I’m stiluck on a cocktail of drugs, most of which don’t help but doctors are too scared to take me off them because the repercussions for me can be so bad.

38 2018-03-06 23:57:22 Anyone got advice on taking off eyelash extensions from home? I have argan oil and a couple other oils im using so I dont rip out my natural lashes
39 2018-03-06 23:57:15 400 calories of oil and fill the rest with popcorn was basically my breakfast, lunch, and dinner all last weekend.  
40 2018-03-06 23:57:09 key quote in your article, unless you need to store it, wind and solar are only as good as your worst battery. You need batteries, go look at the lithium mines, they are doing way more damage to the environment than the oil sands, and create an enormous carbon footprint
41 2018-03-06 23:57:07 Jimmy Carter oversaw extensive deregulation of the US economy. Trucking, airlines, oil, and railroads. Also, most importantly, home brewing.
42 2018-03-06 23:57:02 Thank you so much for answering! Thats good that its sustainably sourced. But im curious about how your process to collect palm oil works. Anymore info you can give me?  always wanting to learn more about this stuff!
43 2018-03-06 23:56:59 You got to work with what you have, cause I don’t even think castor oil can perform the miracles you’re looking for  x
44 2018-03-06 23:56:36 Gary sees things "GLOBALLY" but I remember waiting for GAS when OPEC did a "GLOBAL" NUMBER ON US.  Soon we will be main producer of OIL, which GREATLY BENEFITS US, so why not be main producer of STEEL & ALUMINUM too?  The BENEFITS for us will be astronomical!  @realDonaldTrump
45 2018-03-06 23:56:36 Olive oil, it works so amazingly, I dod mine way too thin at one point, massaged warm olive oil into them for 5 minutes before bed, rinsed with warm water in the morning and they were back in like 1-2weeks haha
46 2018-03-06 23:56:31 I’m from the oil patch in West Texas. I love this.
47 2018-03-06 23:56:12 Energy executives say the Trump administration's proposed steel and aluminium tariffs could bump up the cost of big-ticket projects needed for rapidly rising U.S. shale oil and gas output by three to 10 percent.
48 2018-03-06 23:56:11 lol oil lol I meant to show u the shark fin Jamaican curry goat barbecued grilled crab shell wedge chart....  lol rofl
49 2018-03-06 23:55:58 The Truth Prevails. Oil will be running through all pipelines by 2020, is my blind faith !!!!
50 2018-03-06 23:55:53 BOOM: USA Set to Be World's Largest Oil Producer.
Yes we want to be the worlds largest producer because every dollar goes straight into the US Economy! America First Baby!

51 2018-03-06 23:55:45 shetland's oil.

"uk was rescued" oh dear you do wonder how on earth it managed before oil

oh dear. international law has always invited negotiation on such matters. unless both parties agree the boundary would be in dispute. best resolved through dialogue and negotiation.

53 2018-03-06 23:55:31 I've heard it's much harder for women to pull off :( (assuming long hair), a couple things seem to help though:

- making sure you do the cold water rinse
- occasionally doing a coconut oil washing (use it like leave in conditioner for 30-60 mins then shower)

If you try it, lmk!
54 2018-03-06 23:54:57 Does putting oil on your hair actually do anything looool seems like a fad to me
55 2018-03-06 23:54:50 it has another oil production these days the overall benefits are small
56 2018-03-06 23:54:48 It’s ok I cried for like a half hour because I spilled baby oil on my cat
57 2018-03-06 23:54:47 3/ Soy minimal in US diet, except fractionated as hydrolyzed soy protein, soy oil, & lecithin. 2 actually ingest significant amount of isoflavones you'll need 2 eat straight soy products like daufu, tempeh, soy milk. Doesn't seem 2B having much effect on Chinese or Indonesians.
58 2018-03-06 23:54:46 Energy independence is one of the most crucial aspects of a free nation in today’s uncertain World markets. Foreign oil has gotten the US in multiple conflicts of quid pro quo. Thank you for working to finally return us to a truly stable foundation. 
59 2018-03-06 23:54:46 Homemade. Baking soda, peppermint oil, coconut oil.
60 2018-03-06 23:54:46 Blue is stegadon scale green and temple guard blue with a nuln oil and coelia green shade wash. The belly was rakarth and witch flesh with the same washes used sparingly.
61 2018-03-06 23:54:44 How many sick days, family leave, holiday pay, insurance, workmans comp, matching payroll taxes, no show work days does Flippy consume?
62 2018-03-06 23:54:43 Yup! I always turn to Drudgery when I want factual news about world oil production. I'm sure Wall Street does, too.
63 2018-03-06 23:54:36 Anyone who has had to work (and I use that term lightly with Labrador) with Trump should be a proponent of CBD oil.
64 2018-03-06 23:54:31 anybody have any recommendations for cbd oil?

me: Tomorrow.
boss: Tonight?

boss: [sigh]

68 2018-03-06 23:54:20 Hey there! Only our Coconut White Chip Macadamia Protein Cookie contains sustainably sourced palm oil. All other flavors do not contain this ingredient.
69 2018-03-06 23:54:19 Im 29 and today, for the first time, i replaced the front brakes/rotors and changed my oil. Its finally happened. Im officially a man now. I can already feel my mustache thickening up!
70 2018-03-06 23:54:15 C’mon, social justice and victim mentality aren’t going to teach themselves.
71 2018-03-06 23:54:05 I got peppermint oil in my eye and now I appreciate life so much more than i did an hour ago.
72 2018-03-06 23:54:03 Appreciate when you do though. I have a hard time grasping the whole oil industry ins and outs and a lot of what you say goes straight over my head but i figure if I keep trying something will stick eventually.
73 2018-03-06 23:53:57 Not necessarily. While renewable energy could bring and end to the dependence on oil for energy, most manufacturing facilities, and any mane made anything with an engine or moving metal parts still need oil of some type for lubrication.
74 2018-03-06 23:53:56 if they say coconut oil just walk away
75 2018-03-06 23:53:43 Pointless. Perhaps EU will back us ? Not while Russia is supplying their oil and gas.
76 2018-03-06 23:53:34 You need the right concentration and they have to be used in conjunction, not separate. They work quite well because they clear out the oil at the top and inside the pimple. Basically takes away a lot of the things you need to create a pimple.
77 2018-03-06 23:53:33 Partisan BS, is when decades of opposition to oil and gas industry, hiring of anti pipeline ideologues is forgotten.
78 2018-03-06 23:53:28 My hair literally eats oil 
79 2018-03-06 23:53:25 Apparently the one they ate...it could be any factor
80 2018-03-06 23:53:08 @PatMcAfeeShow Yo heard you're trying to jump the dirtbike over a house. Come visit Lucas Oil Stadium March 24 for some Supercross. Get a preview.
81 2018-03-06 23:53:08 I want this as an oil painting
82 2018-03-06 23:52:56 handmade vs freeze dried with oil
83 2018-03-06 23:52:53 i got vitamin e oil on my new shirt this is what i get for moisturizing?
84 2018-03-06 23:52:42 Those involved with the Expo are not better than "snake oil" Shysters
85 2018-03-06 23:52:42 Right-wing politicians gave it away to the oil barons and left no nest egg for the people of Alberta.  You got scammed.  The clean-up costs of the tailing ponds and abandoned wells are going to devastate Alberta's economy and citizens will be on the hook. Push for renewables now
86 2018-03-06 23:52:42 The prospect of tariffs is bearish not only for stocks and US dollar, but also oil, Aussie and Canadian dollar.

Will be interesting to see what bitcoin does in upcoming days.

I'm tentatively long BTC again.
87 2018-03-06 23:52:36 @OrrinHatch How much kickback you getting from Big Oil? You reduced the boundaries of Bears Ears 85%! Why? Well oil, of course. Everyone of your “cult party” is on the take! EVERY ONE! You DO NOT deserve to be called a senator! Period! #EnoughIsEnough
88 2018-03-06 23:52:30 No reasonable person believes that he wins industry’s tax breaks are an issue. Oil and Natural Gas tax breaks are crippling our budget. This is a sloppy headline.
89 2018-03-06 23:52:20 And then I usually wear a light layer of loreal infallible pro matte foundation and set it with maybelline fit me powder and I barely get any oil on my face all day
90 2018-03-06 23:52:14 @realDonaldTrump So now what are you going to do? Mueller is getting close and the Republicans are turning their back on you! It's been a little over a year and your ship is going down. See to many of us  you're nothing more then a bad snake oil salesman. You're melting old man.
91 2018-03-06 23:52:13 yes. The U.S. also benefits when oil prices fall.
92 2018-03-06 23:52:11 Energy executives say the Trump administration's proposed steel and aluminium tariffs could bump up the cost of big-ticket projects needed for rapidly rising U.S. shale oil and gas output by three to 10 percent.
93 2018-03-06 23:52:05 Didn't need to work out today after spending about 30 minutes trying to get the oil filter off my truck.
94 2018-03-06 23:52:03 Sorry. My phrase "in a pipe a ship a tank a truck" means to say that oil and gas cannot be contained anywhere.
95 2018-03-06 23:51:44 During maintainence gas is consumed from gas stocks, when online consumed from oil stocks refinery. Result No difference. Demand does not change in both cases. In first case you have minus in gas stocks in the second from oil stock as oil is refined into gas.
96 2018-03-06 23:51:39 Almond oil or coconut oil
97 2018-03-06 23:51:35 Yeah Manchester City did very well with that oil money. Not like PSG
98 2018-03-06 23:51:25 Do they have Palm Oil in them? I stopped eating Lennys&Larrys after realizing theyre product is bad for animals. 
99 2018-03-06 23:51:17 I really went to two hair stores today and neither one of them sold the argon oil edge control  my edges are about to be struggling tomorrow 
100 2018-03-06 23:51:14 I’ll continue to use my Olive Oil or Argan Oil because the JBCO & Flaxseed Oil doesn’t hold at alllllll. And I bought a big container of it I’m sick.
101 2018-03-06 23:51:09 Come join the dark side and get into oil and gas like me brother.
102 2018-03-06 23:51:08 Energy executives say the Trump administration's proposed steel and aluminium tariffs could bump up the cost of big-ticket projects needed for rapidly rising U.S. shale oil and gas output by three to 10 percent.
103 2018-03-06 23:51:01 .Everyone forgets, or likely don't know, that all the easy to acquire iron ore and coal have all ready been exploited like timber, gold, and other minerals. It's all been high-graded. Oil, too.
104 2018-03-06 23:50:53 How is my house heated by oil in BC? How does moving oil from Alberta through BC help heat my house with oil. I am hydro power. Isnt this oil for export
105 2018-03-06 23:50:53 My horses get hemp seed hearts & oil during riding season. I see an increase in focus in my horse with it & an increase in coat condition. I’m now seeing where people are using CBD on animals and I’m doing to heavily research that as well 
106 2018-03-06 23:50:48 上昇が止まらない・・・
107 2018-03-06 23:50:35 The Jamaican Black Castor & Flaxseed Oil Eco Styler is  it just looks pretty af. Lol
108 2018-03-06 23:50:28 The evil one is going to destroy the land in this country looking for oil, and the trumpees are going to help him. The trouble his after it's done it's to late to fix it. More money for big oil.

113 2018-03-06 23:50:00 Lmao very boring British man, I loved others like international environmental law, impacts of oil production.. the rest were zzz
114 2018-03-06 23:49:55 Fake News narrative? It doesn’t take a news program for Americans to realize that you back whoever donates the most money to you or benefits your family that gets your backing. Saudi’s, oil pipelines, etc. You’re destroying America for profit.
115 2018-03-06 23:49:51 After getting my oil changed at a dealership, I find myself asking 2 questions:
1. Was it necessary to change my radio station when driving <60 seconds?
2. Who are these "men" working in the service dept that prefer pop over alternative rock?
116 2018-03-06 23:49:42 City of Baltimore "schools", so they weren't learning anything anyhow.

118 2018-03-06 23:49:20 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
119 2018-03-06 23:49:09 Debate is framed as if we live in a tariff free  world. General narrative is U.S is only country imposing them. Far from true.
120 2018-03-06 23:49:03 Coconut oil got me shining, smelling good, and feeling soft 
121 2018-03-06 23:48:54 You be surprised how many dudes in oil and gas work offshore and can’t swim. Buddy of mine did the crazy helicopter dump training with me and couldn’t even tread water. Dude has balls.
122 2018-03-06 23:48:48 the cheapest dirty less desirable oil...
123 2018-03-06 23:48:42 @SecretaryZinke Where did drumpf find you? The same place he found mnuchin? How much of a kickback you getting from Big Oil for opening up Bears Ears? Emails PROVE you did it for oil! What an ignoramus and corrupt “official” you are! Reprehensible! #EnoughIsEnough
124 2018-03-06 23:48:40 Don't be quick to judge what? The billboard was erected and later removed. Isn't that fuckery from whoever erected it in the first place
125 2018-03-06 23:48:36 me: omg i can use my tax return to go to new york!
my car: or your registration, insurance, and oil change :)
126 2018-03-06 23:48:28 I feel like I've seen OIL on every type of screen now.
127 2018-03-06 23:48:22 I tend to put on a brave face 99.999% of the time on twitter so I’ll be transparent today. 

I hate my life right now. I hate the anxiety. I hate the desperation. I hate the decisions I have to make. I hate feeling. 

I hope the oil will help me feel less anxiety abd better.
128 2018-03-06 23:48:03 Kikoman soy sauce, sesame oil, and chili garlic make such a good simple sauce, I'm love
129 2018-03-06 23:47:49 So I got an essential oil diffuser ..........this shit smells like hookah
130 2018-03-06 23:47:46 You sleeping on the powers of coconut oil and prayer lol that beard will connect with time 
131 2018-03-06 23:47:45 Good god brother. Get another job. Grow spuds, herd sheep or camels. Then you could become a proper philosopher, in the evenings by oil light. I would not last 10 seconds doing what you do, it takes me at least an invitation to court to write a Mothers day card.
132 2018-03-06 23:47:45 Theoretically? Sure. Practically we would be either sharing the debt or keeping it, and either sharing the oil or losing it. Sharing the pound or not. We would have divergent interests. Which would be the whole point.
133 2018-03-06 23:47:43 Feels good when you get shit done, 
Had breakfast with my parents, got a haircut, gonna take my car too get a oil change, & wash my clothes. Then I gotta go do my taxes. Sheesh I'm a beast lol
134 2018-03-06 23:47:37 It's amazing how 30 % of the USA is so dam gullible to be sucked in by a snake oil salesman. And ya just keep buying another bottle hoping yur hair won't fall our.
135 2018-03-06 23:47:35 Going through files in a non password protected non encrypted computer is a lot different than you describe a better analogy would be going through your glovebox during a oil change and again if it’s not locked in public that would again be on me .
136 2018-03-06 23:47:33 Tbh I've been having mad cramps lately and even though I've cut back on THC quite a bit, the CBD oil has been helping a lot. I'm excited to see how this works for my anxiety before events. Sometimes it's just not practical for me to be high when I go out.
137 2018-03-06 23:47:28 Might be the best beard oil I’ve ever made
138 2018-03-06 23:47:17 Put a clip up of my afro on Snapchat and people asking me what I put in my hair. 

Usually use Miss Jessie’s hair products but I’ve been trying the Rich Hair products from Ross too. 

Rich Hair Argan oil is my fave
139 2018-03-06 23:46:50 Favorite part about getting my oil changed is that they vacuum the floor boards. Jiffy lube u the bomb
140 2018-03-06 23:46:44 I would not self-dose CBD oil. Only use under the care of a trained professional or doctor.  Be careful.
141 2018-03-06 23:46:43 ...shortly before Tins passed I had started researching CBD oil after a friend had used it on her dog who had cancer. A lot of pet owners use it for anxiety as well - that might be another option.
142 2018-03-06 23:46:35 I didn’t know that steel could burn. Must’ve been a lot of oil or gasoline spilled at one time.
143 2018-03-06 23:46:32 It's amazing how 30 % of the USA is so dam gullible to be sucked in by a snake oil salesman. And ya just keep buying another bottle hoping yur hair won't fall our.

146 2018-03-06 23:45:58 Why da oil gotta be black? #raciststatesofamurica
147 2018-03-06 23:45:36 If you took your car in for repair & they disassembled the entire thing for an oil change would you accept that behavior?
I am not saying pedos aren't bad, but being okay with their rights getting trampled means you don't care about your rights.
148 2018-03-06 23:45:32 I believe they're made from different parts of the plant and have different purposes. CBD is usually the one used for medical purposes. Hemp seed oil is more used as a dietary or hygienic tool.
149 2018-03-06 23:45:29 1/3 The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) has launched public and stakeholder engagements on its proposed changes to the Petroleum Resources Act (PRA) and Oil and Gas Operations Act (OGOA).

151 2018-03-06 23:45:19 Your going to make it "Oil Tot". It's what you deserve! 
152 2018-03-06 23:45:16 My hair does not like coconut oil. It’s a big no
153 2018-03-06 23:45:15 That's two of us then. The Sunday league must have been harder than the premier league then! Or those games in the Wearside league were more stressful than the ones at Old Trafford. Either way I need the oil of olay
154 2018-03-06 23:45:12 Oil is an unsustainable revenue driver hence the Saudi support for jihad..the more radical Islam remains,the longer Muslims will travel 4haj
155 2018-03-06 23:45:06 Did he though? I don't remember oil prices going down under Bush...
156 2018-03-06 23:44:45 Really? Many plants are closed and moved to US and we have no where to sell oil except US. Are you fucking joking?
157 2018-03-06 23:44:38 Oil + filter with labor: 45
Cabin filter + labor: 32
Air filter + labor: 52
Balance rotate + labor: 49

Then some random 10 dollar charge for the service.

161 2018-03-06 23:44:26 Just a reminder: @jkenney thinks it's okay to out young LGBTQ+ kids. Whatever your stance on "ethical oil" may be (ethical oil doesn't exist, btw), he's a creep with no interest in allaying the stigma LGBTQ+ youth face. How's that for some ethics?
162 2018-03-06 23:44:19 Why in the hell does an oil change for my car cost 65.00??? 
163 2018-03-06 23:44:13 Don't apologize "Oil Tot" sometimes technology fails. Simply use your streaming time to realize and rest. I'm hoping your on your way to feeling better!
164 2018-03-06 23:44:11 It's not pure sour cream. I should have said "sour cream dressing" - bc it's sour cream, vinegar, pumpkin seed oil, water and salt/herbs
165 2018-03-06 23:44:02 Coconut oil can be used for anything. Lube even 
166 2018-03-06 23:44:00 It's amazing how 30 % of the USA is so dam gullible to be sucked in by a snake oil salesman. And ya just keep buying another bottle hoping yur hair won't fall our.
167 2018-03-06 23:44:00 Turning off the taps to BC is about as clueless as it gets.  So, then you just shut in more AB oil from markets.
168 2018-03-06 23:43:35 Graham, just here to add some proper creative debate on what the company is about, ie gas and oil discovery and getting it to production!. Which they have been rather GOOD at over the years!..

172 2018-03-06 23:43:00 The Oil is in Texas and Louisiana. Pay attention
173 2018-03-06 23:42:53 Yup. I live near CMU. When I heard about the recent shooting there and that the shooter hadn't been caught yet (and not having details of motive), I was glad to have my gun in case he made his way toward my home.

177 2018-03-06 23:42:45 Damn that’s pretty sweeet, oil’s dope to mix with lol I mostly just mess around with acrylic 
178 2018-03-06 23:42:42 Keep putting tariffs on countries, go it solo, have no trading partners, and see how much demand for oil occurs then dumbass

180 2018-03-06 23:42:38 Sort of like the ones I buy from Aldi? I always bake them cos I’m scared of frying things with lots of oil 
181 2018-03-06 23:42:33 The United States is the worlds largest oil exporter now
182 2018-03-06 23:42:29 is it weird that I use coconut oil as a hilight..? cause that shit makes me glow
183 2018-03-06 23:42:28 そうそれタンパク質のやつ見たときめちゃくちゃ笑った
184 2018-03-06 23:42:26 Olive oil, salt, pepper and lemon are the only things that go in a salad
185 2018-03-06 23:42:23 It's a Walther PPQ.
186 2018-03-06 23:42:21 Except CO2 emissions  shift to power stations instead which increases coal consumption by double the energy released by oil. This translates to a 50% inefficiency which when combined with the 72%  battery power inefficiency means 181% energy demand increase! Lose all round.
187 2018-03-06 23:42:07 DJIA closed up 0.04pct to 24,884. S&P 500 up 0.26pct to 2,728 and Nasdaq up 0.56pct to 7,372. US crude oil $62.60, Brent $65.79

192 2018-03-06 23:41:34 Expensive ass oil change
193 2018-03-06 23:41:34 More like a canola oil. Or maybe even lard?

207 2018-03-06 23:39:56 What kind of oil is used for heat treating?
208 2018-03-06 23:39:51 So we get to be the leader in the last century’s energy source. Great. What’s next: whale oil?
209 2018-03-06 23:39:48 These bland platitudes conceal the simple fact that Alberta got so overly dependant on selling oil that they are losing their minds trying to double capacity. And BC is just not having it. You prairie folk don't mind if there's an enormous spill; we kind of do.
210 2018-03-06 23:39:36 Heck
When I was like 18 I had a bad 63 Ford fairlane. The mechanic built me a strong motor. But this day I was enjoying the noise it made and getting down on it between Hardee’s & another place. I hit it, broke the motor support, busted a oil filter and it looked like I blew up
211 2018-03-06 23:39:34 I have engine oil/grease on my pants

I'm a real butch lesbian now
212 2018-03-06 23:39:26 @projectcarsgame No turbo pressure shown in 959S :'( all the other things inside the car as oil pressure working great.
213 2018-03-06 23:39:20 Oil sands are more expensive to mine than pumping oil and gas from fracked wells.  Econ. 101
214 2018-03-06 23:39:14 Let's see: Lived thru the 60's, losing a dad at age 10, drugs, military draft, cold war fears of nuclear war, 70's oil "shortage", hurricanes, major blizzards, raising 3 kids, losing half of my savings, so, no, I'm not worried now.
215 2018-03-06 23:38:54 "Ethical oil" does not exist. Repeat: ethical oil does not exist. ETHICAL OIL DOES NOT EXIST! Once more, ethical oil ... does ... not ... exist!
216 2018-03-06 23:38:42 And we can do sweet FA about it because we still need their oil 
217 2018-03-06 23:38:38 Lighting and primer ahahahahaha. When I exfoilate I use oil and sugar or salt. Nothing major 
218 2018-03-06 23:38:22 Great news!!  Next year, we can lead the world it producing typewriters!  Maybe even whale oil for lighting our street lamps.
219 2018-03-06 23:38:10 SOS = sugar, oil, salt?
220 2018-03-06 23:37:58 Do you honestly think there's good job security in oil?
221 2018-03-06 23:37:57 starting the oil change with “you have such beautiful eyes”
and ending with “your signature, ma’am? because I’m your biggest fan” 
is the fastest way to lose me as a customer
222 2018-03-06 23:37:31 I feel nuclear power is so controversial because the accidents that have occurred have had a lot of media coverage and serious consequences, although oil rigs and coal mines also have the same consequences.
223 2018-03-06 23:37:29 Except that a large proportion of the climate community would denounce any conference to which oil companies are invited as participants rather than supplicants.
224 2018-03-06 23:37:27 It does not matter. Just add oil, cushing, gas and distillates and if differens is less than 3 mln price spikes down and return back. The same with EIA but difference of more than 3 mln should be in comparison with API.

228 2018-03-06 23:36:51 Molasses cookies are one of mine, too! Similar recipe to yours but uses liquid vegetable oil instead of Crisco. Only cookie recipe I've ever seen that does that. Super yummy tho.
229 2018-03-06 23:36:48 Key themes @CERAWeek Day 2: #TCFD; companies racing to reduce emissions; #CCUS; the reality of decline rates and running fast to keep output flat; #OGCI; oil's role in the energy transition; digitization, efficiency and sustainability of cost savings.
230 2018-03-06 23:36:47 Such a pack of lies. We have enough natural resources like oil, don't need more! As for jobs, there are MORE than enough available now and will be soon in renewable energy! Cross training in solar, wind and others would provide long term good paying jobs! We only have one planet.

234 2018-03-06 23:36:05 Oil and gas are on the way out, if you really want to help Albertans than help them adjust for the future
235 2018-03-06 23:35:56 Yup. Variations that avoid cities will be an option. For oil platforms, they count as people. There will undoubtedly be some level of notification/acceptance when best paths are found. I remember at CSXT 2004 at Black Rock, FAA made us verify area including UPRR rail was clear.
236 2018-03-06 23:35:55 Would love to try gold body oil I have subscribed 
237 2018-03-06 23:35:53 Except Mesa County commissioners! They just pray for oil and gas to come back
238 2018-03-06 23:35:41 Loving your family means taking responsibility for safety, not farming it out to others who may or may not show up when it counts.
239 2018-03-06 23:35:18 There are heaps of session beers out there.  Beavertown Neck Oil and Elusive Plan-B and 6 degrees North Wanderlust Wheat are my personal fave session beers. I would happily drink either repeatedly on a night out.

241 2018-03-06 23:34:56 So I’ve been using hi smile for about a month or so now and I’m actually in love with it. The coconut oil mouthwash makes me gag though so that is just casually collecting dust.

245 2018-03-06 23:34:39 Just wondering why so many US Jets are flying in. I live next to the airport and just today I counted 4 US Jets coming in. An article in the newspaper states that Russia is getting oil from Venezuela to pay off billions of dollars of their debt.
246 2018-03-06 23:34:38 Trump says the WH is being run like a well-oiled machine but I'm worried they applied too much oil to the machine and everything is falling out
247 2018-03-06 23:34:25 From earlier at #CERAWeek: BP CEO says #oil market is inside a $50-$65 a barrel range for a few years. "We're in a fairway" #OOTT
248 2018-03-06 23:34:10 Time will tell, but it seems as the need for Arab oil dries up, more may follow the US need and drop funding.
249 2018-03-06 23:34:02 Y’all, today @lynnielynnn took my car to fill up the tank, get washed and got my oil change and tire rotation done. Get you a best friend like mine.

252 2018-03-06 23:33:39 We also beat you in olive oil ie you are our biggest buyer @realDonaldTrump
253 2018-03-06 23:33:33 Our oil production has absolutely zero to do with Trump. ZERO percent!
254 2018-03-06 23:33:24 .. by promoting more oil & coal companies nationwide. You are putting so many things at risk & in danger with oil! Not only are you putting more human lives in danger but also our air quality, water, wildlife, oceans, lands etc. How many times have we heard, “oops! Another oil ..
255 2018-03-06 23:33:23 "Victim"? Isn't this all self-induced? He was/is stupid and most likely simply working for Russian interests so he can make $ on oil. He's no victim. Just greedy.

262 2018-03-06 23:32:06 Disturbing? The only reason a person would use that kind of language in this case is that they hold assets in Alberta oil sands. I'd like to take a look at Mr. Kenney's portfolio, see what his stake is.

264 2018-03-06 23:32:02 I googled homemade hair masks for overnight n am currently lying in bed with a mix of egg honey and coconut oil on my head that’s dried into a rock solid paper mache on my scalp. Feels like I’ve had drinks poured over my head after a night out n they’ve dried in
265 2018-03-06 23:31:53 Yes...how do you think they pay for that? State owned oil companies and high Tax on imports.
266 2018-03-06 23:31:19 Sir, you should not sell oil for #Bitcoin. You should put super energy power stations to mine Bitcoin, best way to win! #fintech
267 2018-03-06 23:31:13 Only? Seems less than stellar considering numbers of criminal illegals roaming around
268 2018-03-06 23:31:11 That's right "Oil Tot". The Sims 4 uses a whole new engine meaning everything from walking styles, to eating animations had to be remade! Even I knew this. I see this as necessary because when a franchise has been out for so long you need to refresh it. #TheSims4 refreshed us!
269 2018-03-06 23:31:09 You couldn’t win in 2014 basing your case on oil. How are you going to do it without oil income? Be honest: you haven’t a clue.
270 2018-03-06 23:31:06 Modern day snake oil salesmen
271 2018-03-06 23:31:02 To be fair, Baltimore is just trying prevent some shootings by shipping people out of the city.
272 2018-03-06 23:31:00 Ruger LCR or Glock 43.
273 2018-03-06 23:30:46 Cause less damage to your hair and ends and make sure to do treatments on your hair at least once a week and not wash your hair everyday just once a week and add water to your hair to make it look good I honestly recommend doing olive oil hair treatments because I feel that they-
274 2018-03-06 23:30:44 We haven’t?!? No Iran-contra; no GB 41 oil war? Jack abramoff, tom delay, monica lewinsky, shady 11th hour pardons, etc, haliburton getting contracts; blackwater contractors, hanging chads, I could go on...and on. But you’re right; the corruption just started on the hill. Wake up
275 2018-03-06 23:30:39 Mexico is paying for the wall the same way Iraqi oil was going to pay for their, “liberation.” Remember, W assured, assued and, assured us, it wouldn’t cost taxpayers a cent? Iraqis preferred to set the wells on fire, rather than have the proceeds offset our expenses.
276 2018-03-06 23:30:37 without the bio oil it still works, but with the oil it makes my face feel so much better. if you don’t like it you can jojoba oil or aragon oil
277 2018-03-06 23:30:35 all bought from money he got from ripping people off.  and now you are one of those people believing the snake oil salesman.
278 2018-03-06 23:30:33 Been playing with R22 replacements to keep older systems going a bit longer and thus far R438A is the easiest, 407C requires a compressor pull and oil change although I haven't yet pulled one of our 426 jugs out yet? #Americans are spending $ again updating as well...
279 2018-03-06 23:30:33 If we don’t get better trade deals, these tariffs will come back and bite the domestic oil & gas industry, projects will be cancelled, breakeven prices will go up and it will Make OPEC and Russia Great Again! Say goodbye to energy independence w/o exemptions!

282 2018-03-06 23:30:05 Great information. Now let’s start using less of all that stuff. Oil is a precious resource, but we squander it. A carbon tax is ment to have all that stuff be more expensive so we don’t waste oil. So where can we start? Plastic bag ban, straws, water bottles, drop sheets???

284 2018-03-06 23:29:58 Be careful, they will take you for ride. When I bought my truck brand-new I took it in for its first oil change and they told me I needed a radiator flush for $300. Never been back!
285 2018-03-06 23:29:54 Who do you think has been manipulating oil prices.
286 2018-03-06 23:29:47 Popping out the oil stick like 15 times lmao just to be on point .. like bruh really ?? Lol
287 2018-03-06 23:29:43 UPDATE 10-Oil prices edge up on weak dollar ahead of U.S. inventory data #energy #oil
288 2018-03-06 23:29:17 Like just doing an oil change with my pops gotta be difficult  lmao
289 2018-03-06 23:29:08 CNN gave up news and now are just gossiping
290 2018-03-06 23:29:05 Another path south of Cuba with a dogleg is possible as well. And there are some constraints due to numerous Oil platform in the gulf, I have no idea how they will impact the launches.
291 2018-03-06 23:28:20 Why isn't #CBCCalgary asking oil companies what they think of Kenney's stance?
292 2018-03-06 23:28:14 Omg my low carb meal was fish made in coconut oil and broccoli with cheddar cheese. 
293 2018-03-06 23:28:11 Too nervous to go get an oil change(anxierty) so I asked my mom to go with me. WORST IDEA EVER. Anxiety through the roof. Worst experience ever!!! 
294 2018-03-06 23:27:56 Oil? Posh git. Lard in wor hoose. I think everyone is the same. I just wondered did anyone still use this relic of the kitchen that was so prominent 30 years ago
295 2018-03-06 23:27:44 You are screwing up . Soon Canadian oil will be worthless American is going boom again and we do nothing . They get tax cuts we spend more on nothing with a budget that won't have the long or short term effect ..
296 2018-03-06 23:27:35 Really can we trust the corporate I worked for them burger was cooked in same oil/grill as veggie burger
297 2018-03-06 23:27:28 Putin plotting to take Cyprus over.  Oil and Gazit.
298 2018-03-06 23:27:22 Getting tires put on my truck and there's some 70's movie playing in the lobby, and everything smells like oil.I feel weird right now.
299 2018-03-06 23:27:15 500 million dollars in Russian oil fields. Sounds like a reason.
300 2018-03-06 23:27:12 You made that? Nice
301 2018-03-06 23:26:53 I can change my own oil and tire stop playing 
302 2018-03-06 23:26:29 Not really. Doubling debt, weapons of mass destruction, taking dem word on housing which led to crisis just a few things your remembered for
303 2018-03-06 23:26:27 We have oil. And gas. But they're not actually as big a thing as before and the oil price has been volatile recently. There are plenty other countries outside of the EU that are doing fine.
304 2018-03-06 23:26:21 Real madrid vs Man City in the next round. Would like to throw another oil money out of the leauge.

305 2018-03-06 23:26:19 Given that we live in a free and democratic society with freedom of speech Bill Nye has the right to express any view he wants on our oil sands and we have the right to disagree
306 2018-03-06 23:25:57 Yep.
A crash in oil price and all the spiral effects that comes with it.
307 2018-03-06 23:25:51 Yeah. Got nowhere to really keep a pan full of oil in my current house just in case I fancy a chip. Maybe the fact that oven chips are far better than they used to be is a factor?
308 2018-03-06 23:25:35 Scallops  one of my faves
309 2018-03-06 23:25:31 ohooooothank your report so much
310 2018-03-06 23:25:26 Clove oil?
311 2018-03-06 23:25:09 My kitties share the same love of coconut oil as me! It’s so healthy for them and their coats and it’s so cute how excited they get when I give them some as a treat
312 2018-03-06 23:25:09 I don't get what the big deal is. Every other Nation is CUTTING their Oil production to bring prices back up so if the US places no such restrictions.... then they are going to start out producing the Nations that are. Simple math Folks.
   Peace  Y
313 2018-03-06 23:24:39 She’s exactly what the Dem Bulbs deserve, and I’m stumped alright, how the Poverty Pimp intends to sell this snake oil.
314 2018-03-06 23:24:29 I think you also yelled about the tax cuts only being for the rich.
There is also a HUGE security issue here if we do not make STEEL and ALUMINUM in America.  Look at it this way, why would we want OIL independence?  Why not just keep IMPORTING CHEAPER OIL from FOREIGN COUNTRIES?
315 2018-03-06 23:24:02 I made an interesting discovery: coconut oil does not make carpets softer, smoother, or silkier when applied.

316 2018-03-06 23:24:01 It is CLEAR where loyalty stands within the WH

Loyalty is with Russia, Putin & the Oligarchs

Rex was an Exxon Exec allied with Putin & his Russian oil & gas infrastructure to make $Millions$ 

@POTUS is in bed with Putin

The 2 will always vote Russia over USA

317 2018-03-06 23:23:50 @EstherThePig I'm devastated. Oreos pass as vegan but they use palm oil which is killing the Orangatans and other Animals. Gotta care about all of you.
318 2018-03-06 23:23:34 Fish oil supplements will change your life, whether you're getting into shape or back into shape or even maintaining your fitness and health.
319 2018-03-06 23:23:34 You believe, that. You need all the things to produce the things you talk about. Silicon sand and coal. Oil are used to more than only gasoline. The new filters can also take more pollution than advertised by green fighters. To get what you want ,you need something's first.
320 2018-03-06 23:23:32 Globalists out! Bring back coal, old timey typewriters, whale blubber oil lamps and black maids we can give adorable nicknames to!

No seriously it will collapse anything good in American manufacturing ....
321 2018-03-06 23:23:30 The globalists have forgotten the Oil Embargoes of the 1970s, and that our manufacturing capability won 2 world wars. They’re oblivious to our workers and the carbon-emission costs of shipping raw materials, finished products, and recyclables back and forth between continents.
322 2018-03-06 23:23:28 All. Mainly watercolor and oil, I don’t mind acrylic at al because it’s way cheaper than oil.
323 2018-03-06 23:23:20 Different kind of "big oil".
324 2018-03-06 23:22:58 Sound like you need that Jamaican castor oil bro
325 2018-03-06 23:22:52 There are a number of engineers and workers in Texas who were hurt by the oil collapse of a few years ago, who would move if they were offered jobs. Innovative HR policies might help fill vacancies with Americans, without a need for more immigration. Worth exploring...
326 2018-03-06 23:22:46 the success and total proliferation of Bitcoin is finalized and unalterable. It's just waiting to be tapped, like the vast reservoirs of crude oil beneath the surface of the earth pre-industrialization.
327 2018-03-06 23:22:46 OH NO I JUST REALIZED I BOUGHT THTE OLIVE OIL FROM THE "EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL" VINE
328 2018-03-06 23:22:30 US Interior Deputy Asst Secretary Kate MacGregor highlighted how USGS raised estimate of recoverable OIL in Marcellus (gas) shale from 50m bbl in 2003 to 3bn+ in 2011. I think she meant NGLs… right? #makemarcellusoilagain #ceraweek #oilday
329 2018-03-06 23:22:14 Norway has oil. And is an EFTA member. The others have massive natural resources that UK doesn’t have.
330 2018-03-06 23:22:10 @Lloyd_Jayson @SteezyFuck please help me change my oil, I can’t find anywhere to take it where it’ll fit over the pit and I don’t know that I’d trust anyone else...
331 2018-03-06 23:21:47 In a few years fresh water. You buy tons off us already. 25% of all the worlds fresh water is in Canada. You might want to think about that. See how crazy the world gets over oil, well wait until it’s about water
332 2018-03-06 23:21:45 The reason we are so hated is because we get involved in everything and its not because we are moral, its because our economy runs on oil and weapons sales.
333 2018-03-06 23:21:35 Maybe you can build some “affordable” housing for them in the ANWR oil fields, next to the drilling.
334 2018-03-06 23:21:33 THW ban all new and existing offshore oil drilling.

336 2018-03-06 23:20:59 Lmao I’m convinced my hair doesn’t like castor oil. When I put it on my hair that shit feels like wax 
337 2018-03-06 23:20:55 The industry with the most job increase per year is still renewable energy. Focusing solely on oil, and for the love of pete, coal, is a losing strategy. There's a reason other countries aren't increasing their oil production - the first one to develop viable ren. energy wins!
338 2018-03-06 23:20:48 Sorry - sent Joshua w some essential oil for your diffuser for you to try - prayers you feel better soon 
339 2018-03-06 23:20:43 From what I understand, the oil is actually more potent/effective than the pens. The taste is SO good. So surprisingly good.
340 2018-03-06 23:20:37 He's biding his time till he can do that big oil deal with Russia & ruin the environment forever!
341 2018-03-06 23:20:36 Must build pipelines to coasts with Canadian steel ....NOW. And sell oil at world price to world instead of to US for US profit.
342 2018-03-06 23:20:33 Fresh locs and peppermint essential oil (diluted in water) is one of my favorite combinations!
343 2018-03-06 23:20:30 More snake oil from the Democrats when are people going to wake up to their evilness.
344 2018-03-06 23:20:26 Doubt they're Kenyan really. My thinking, Arabs, oil tycoons & those rich guys that live off the grid(like Escobar)they have their "errand boys" to pick the best girls for them. I read an article on how those cartel guys live. Explains why they never have photos of them leaking.
345 2018-03-06 23:20:24 You ever see the mines for those batteries? You ever think about all the Saudi and Iran oil from countries who beat women just because? No you like your boss only see what you want and ignore the rest, just like your dumping of raw sewage into our rivers and oceans!!
346 2018-03-06 23:20:23 Is there anything that coconut oil can't solve?
347 2018-03-06 23:20:22 I have 1 big cup a day .. Dark roast with whipping cream and a teaspoon of coconut oil :)
348 2018-03-06 23:20:18 Can Deputy Premier make assurances that GHG reduction policies outlined, will be enough to lower province's net GHG emissions even when foreign oil consumption from advocated @TransMtn pipeline expansion is considered under standard production-based carbon accounting method?
349 2018-03-06 23:20:16 Lol oil rig that was dashed to someone  lool
350 2018-03-06 23:20:13 Smh I gotta learn to put on an old shirt when I cook at the stove, the oil be ruining my shirts 
351 2018-03-06 23:20:04 I hate coming to get my oil changed
352 2018-03-06 23:19:47 So we are about to watch steel vs oil? This should be interesting
353 2018-03-06 23:19:36 It’s very attached to the oil deal
354 2018-03-06 23:19:26 Salad w/ oil & vinegar is way better & healthier 
355 2018-03-06 23:19:21 smooth as oil!
356 2018-03-06 23:19:19 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
357 2018-03-06 23:19:16 Why some companies like Shell specify American steel.
358 2018-03-06 23:19:15 It's an essential oil mixture! My cousins & friends swear on it lol. I just like that the scent calms me! I would recommend it.
359 2018-03-06 23:19:14 Love how you oil em up
360 2018-03-06 23:19:13 Ask Trudeau and Nye what percentage of our oil reserves should be left in the ground in order to save the planet? Suzuki thinks it's 85%.
361 2018-03-06 23:19:13 Then there are people with disabilities who for various reasons cannot always cook an elaborate meal. I often find myself taking something just to have enough energy to cook myself dinner, so thank you for giving me some good ideas. And relax I take fish oil, not cocaine.

371 2018-03-06 23:18:14 Disgusting! Absolutely disgusting & tragic that our so-called president @realDonaldTrump & his environment hating buddies @EPAScottPruitt @EPA think more oil is a great thing for USA. Instead of actually protecting our environment (EPA) for our future they’d rather destroy it ...
372 2018-03-06 23:18:11 Oil first then brush, that way it covers your hair more evenly! 
373 2018-03-06 23:17:58 He should go visit California oil fields
374 2018-03-06 23:17:55 .....and olive oil and sun dried tomatoes! 
375 2018-03-06 23:17:46 How many years before U.S. reserves of oil & gas are gone?
Another reason for town halls or 4 you to resign of ignorance.
376 2018-03-06 23:17:42 I've tried the cbd oil in the pens before basically the same thing also? But obviously better tasting ?
377 2018-03-06 23:17:39 ...we decided to make bioplastic out of water, vegetable oil and cornstarch cuz why not?

Patay tayo dito pag yan sinagot ko HAHAHAH
378 2018-03-06 23:17:35 In next 25 yes there will be a whole lot less need for oil. Read the big writing on wall, renewable energy sources.
379 2018-03-06 23:17:29 Folding my genitals will certainly cause the loud screaming. That and seeing naked Bronson Pinchot in that Gandalf wig slathered in oil.
380 2018-03-06 23:17:26 I will do your oil change in exchange for some heavy duty hand lotion and a burrito. Serious inquiries only
381 2018-03-06 23:17:24 Sad to watch @BillNye celebrate emission spewing space rockets while attacking  oil

Five Facts he omitted:

1.  = leader in clean tech
2.  = leader in renewables
3.  = leader in CCS
4.  = leader in responsible oil+gas 
5.  = leader in social progress
382 2018-03-06 23:17:08 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Scott Pruitt allowed oil drilling in many young black voters.
383 2018-03-06 23:16:59 did you do lotion, then oil?
384 2018-03-06 23:16:58 That's the next one. Either that or Big Oil...
385 2018-03-06 23:16:51 Venezuela and Iran are overly demonized in western media purely because they have huge oil reserves that western plutocrats want access to.
386 2018-03-06 23:16:40 What is the price of crude oil now and how much it when Goodluck was in power?

390 2018-03-06 23:16:27 @BillNye advocating against Canadian pipelines ensures that oil  development and production will move from the most heavily regulated environment in the world to places like Russia, Nigeria and Venezuela. What are the environmental and human rights standards like in those places?

409 2018-03-06 23:14:03 Centennial CEO Papa: oil demand is clearly going to grow, not a sunset industry, but is perceived as one and is probably the worst in terms of PR. How to square the circle?

Yeah maybe your GOP could think like you and smart spend too, like on people instead of weapons and education instead of war and on feeding kids at lunch rather than drilling for oil off shore and destroying the very earth we live on!

426 2018-03-06 23:11:04 Check out Wabamun Lake, spill was relatively small & there were reports of oil still washing up. Residents were unhappy with the response from industry.

I wonder how those Albertans at Wabamun would feel if a terminal was placed on their lake, then the volume increased 7 fold..

433 2018-03-06 23:10:13 @watsonfuels so - we’re on automatic topup and our oil just ran out...how does that work then?
434 2018-03-06 23:10:09 Try these strateiges with every relationship in your life:
Be quick to listen.
 Be slow to speak.
 Be ready to forgive. (It’s the oil that keeps the engine of every relationship running.)
Be willing to ask for help.
435 2018-03-06 23:10:02 @JulieBishopMP are we Aust to wealthy? To rich? Giving away billions in oil to East T. Jesus you useless politicians piss me off. Stupid. @sophie_walsh9 @2GB873

437 2018-03-06 23:10:00 And for some strange reason, oil rich Norway knows how to use their oil fund to benefit their citizens.
438 2018-03-06 23:09:56 I took my car to get the oil changed and the mechanic handed me my keys back and said “obviously I had to move your seat back” like okay damn you don’t have to come at my height like that sir
439 2018-03-06 23:09:54 You say that "your 9" is too big--which model is it? A .380 is the same caliber but a lot less powerful.

442 2018-03-06 23:09:23 Saw this picture of a very young boy crossing a desert area by himself.  Didn't want to read the story.  At what stage is the West going to stop causing havoc and misery because of oil or whatever.  It is the innocents that suffer 
So many examples just sad

457 2018-03-06 23:07:31 I loved my little Sym Fiddle when there was a mechanic around the corner cuz those little engines need oil changes every eight hundred miles. But once he retired the closest mechanic was cross town so every breakdown or flat tire was an expensive towing bill.

464 2018-03-06 23:06:55 I enjoy the 30 day snooze feature because I know I have given someone a fair chance to come to their senses before I completely unfriend them for being a climate denier or a Nazi or an essential oil bossbabe. Yes, those are roughly equal in badness.

477 2018-03-06 23:04:28 Best to try natural methods like using brown sugar and mixing it with coconut oil and essential oils to apply on skin for exfoliating. There are a lot of these in on  YouTube.

480 2018-03-06 23:04:11 Bawahahaha. Not that old chestnut. Keep the oil, it was not factored into the discussion, far to many other ways , starting with the bloated civil servants we pay for. Our eyes are on the prize, Oil will be our pocket money 
481 2018-03-06 23:04:06 He used Juve to return as top contender to go to Russia with the National team. Dani Valves is now out of sorts - many thanks to oil money. Will be interesting to see if Tite will gamble to take him along.
482 2018-03-06 23:03:59 What times dinner?
483 2018-03-06 23:03:47 That's the price tho. They're oil paintings.
484 2018-03-06 23:03:30 And peak oil, coal, massive starvation, y2k, it goes on and on but the science is settled. Follow either the money or power, often seen together!
485 2018-03-06 23:03:23 We are aware thanks and perhaps you need to stop presuming you know more than we do about these matters. Your basic premise that throttling Alberta oil production reduces GHG is at best unproven and at worst deceitful

491 2018-03-06 23:02:54 Right?! It’s everything! It goes on so easy + keeps skin soft with nourishing mango butter, coconut oil, and avocado oil. 
492 2018-03-06 23:02:43 The foundation  of your logic is weak. Since it's  optional,  it is very possible  she didn't  offer it,  did you offer oil and gas law?  I did.  So if we  begin to talk,  does that mean I'm  more intelligent  than you or vice versa? NO!
493 2018-03-06 23:02:43 I changed my oil today. I am a man now.

506 2018-03-06 23:01:06 The State needs to get more $$ from the oil and gas industries clamoring after our natural resources. Otherwise they’ll get away with robbing the people the same way coal companies in the past did. But Rs are in control and we know how that goes.

519 2018-03-06 22:59:32 Six things you can do to help our environment & slow climate change

1) stop using plastic bottles/straws.
2) RECYCLE.
3) switch from beef to chicken. 
4) walk/cycle when you can.
5) avoid products with palm oil in.
6) pressure the government to invest in renewable energy.

521 2018-03-06 22:59:20 Exactly & if U read Q 2 weeks ago he called this. If U understood why we need 2 do these tariffs U would want them. I have been in the oil field industry for the past 9.5 years the pipe we were to receive from China is not too the grade we need. Let alone our Military equipment.

524 2018-03-06 22:59:06 The problem is the security issues with depending on foreign oil and foreign resources (steel for instance) when our national security is at stake. Same thing with knowing where your food comes from you know what's in it if you produce it yourselves.

546 2018-03-06 22:56:30 Actually, oil and gas-based products, despite their masculine associations, act as oestrogen mimickers, causing reduced sperm counts, genitalia underdevelopment, and femininization of foetuses.
547 2018-03-06 22:56:27 Great message to the industry by Mark Papa. Shale oil production will not meet the 'forecasts for spectacular growth in U.S. oil production' as the EIA has predicted.

557 2018-03-06 22:55:49 Is there a reason that "ripe" olives (the buttery-tasting truly black olives, not purple kalamata etc.) don't come in resealable jars? I can find them in oil w pits in the Loblaws olive bar or pitted and/or sliced in brine in cans but never in jars.

563 2018-03-06 22:55:33 Putin put Rex Tillerson, the Exxon executive, in our White House to help ensure trump follows through with his promise to lift the Russian sanctions. Russia will grow greatly from it's oil wealth once that's done, so will Putin's power. Until then Putin won't let Rex exit!

569 2018-03-06 22:54:56 Heated up (low heat) small skillet w olive oil. Threw down medallions for about 3 minutes on each side. Added sauce....flipped medallions once more for about 2 minutes....poured over microwaved rice and boom! You could never re heat a nice piece of meat in the microwave.
570 2018-03-06 22:54:47 Please, please no offshore drilling. We've seen the results of oil spills near UC Santa Barbara in the past. The cleanup efforts required, the effect if has on wildlife, birds, beaches, communities is staggering and can be prevented. Preserve our CA shoreline & waters

575 2018-03-06 22:54:21 It was just my first time trying it in oil form so that's what they sent. I think I'd probably bump it up next time too.

577 2018-03-06 22:54:14 He’s driving away customers. If BC can’t get their oil from Alberta they’ll go through Yukon. His toll on BC’s natural gas is hurting Albertans as well.
578 2018-03-06 22:54:13 We are mad because they stop us dividing up Syria and taking their oil.

589 2018-03-06 22:51:16 I had to carry a litre of olive oil in my coat pocket today cuz like you, my arms were full of other stuff.
590 2018-03-06 22:51:14 Or completely lie and tell them you're an opera singer or a North Sea Oil Driller or an underwater basket weaver. They won't believe you, but you can have a funny conversation about it! #FWChat
591 2018-03-06 22:51:14 Odd that they still can’t say how much of that “61%” is “trade” with our own offshore oil industry as UK govt statistics treat “offshore” as a different country.

603 2018-03-06 22:50:14 Tax oil at 7% like other states instead of giving tax breaks to the rich and corporations. We give our main natural resource away for practical half price. Oil is not "renewable" OK voters, once its gone it's gone & oil Co's don't move due to taxes, where would they go for less?

652 2018-03-06 22:44:45 Better to recognize the phrase therapeutic grade as little more than an ambiguous & misleading term that won't survive critical scrutiny & doesn't match any established research or any independent detailed study even if an oil smells better & was grown under better conditions.

679 2018-03-06 22:42:06 Calories don't necessarily make you full and not for long, but are recommended to count in order to avoid over eating an unnecessary amount of a certain types of food.

No. Our interests are not materialistic,
682 2018-03-06 22:41:20 Ok, my understanding. This oil doesnt have it, so will the other plant properties show up? Asking for a friend!!! No, I'm REALLY serious! I don't have a clue, but talked hub n2 using some drops & his employer does random drug tests. Uh, oooh!!!

711 2018-03-06 22:37:33 I like the idea of disposable pens as long as they are from recycled material or at least not material dangerous to the environment. Otherwise, oil that can fill a permanent vape pen would be cool! CBD deodorant would be interesting as well (if it’s even possible that is)
712 2018-03-06 22:37:32 With Yards Located in Midland TX / Permian Basin and Alice Tx / Eagle Ford. We are able to provide fast, efficient, and quality chemicals in two of the major oil production platforms.

716 2018-03-06 22:36:31 Who has oil :(
717 2018-03-06 22:36:24 Now do oil immersion!
718 2018-03-06 22:36:22 Saw same on a few black cabs today too.  Someone is pouring a lot of (oil?) $$ into this advertising propaganda.  Thoroughly disgusted, but that's the "free market" for you.
719 2018-03-06 22:36:21 does oil pulling and putting activated charcoal on your teeth actually whiten them: an experiment
720 2018-03-06 22:36:15 Both statements are correct. Strategically, the Japs wanted bases in the oil rich Dutch East Indies, but Japanese commanding officers later admitted in interviews that they feared the armed populace of America.
721 2018-03-06 22:36:04 Have y’all tried the Coconut oil Eco Styler Gel??
722 2018-03-06 22:35:45 Hey have to be registered in CA to file, why I have I have diff atty even though I’m in MD, some of my clients are DC & VA..
723 2018-03-06 22:35:38 All u need is biotin oil mixed with lavender and peppermint oil. Refreshes your scalp while leaving a pleasant scent and promoting growth
724 2018-03-06 22:35:32 I have them in my home - and had them also when my kids were here - to protect them from men like Oliver Willis.
725 2018-03-06 22:35:30 He put it upside down, growling as he began ripping in two, getting splattered with oil as he pulled his sis out

730 2018-03-06 22:35:02 Bernie would be very very very proud of Beto & Beto's contributors!!

732 2018-03-06 22:34:49 Oh good! Yeah I've tried CBD blends in Co and Seattle before, but never an oil. I'm definitely loving it. Helll yess Mother Nature!
733 2018-03-06 22:34:46 That particular one marks the pipeline into the Hamble oil depot for the export of Wytch Farm crude oil. There is a special mark about 100m either side of it showing the limits of the prohibited area for anchoring/dredging in that part of Southampton Water to protect the pipe.
734 2018-03-06 22:34:37 Cuts, scars, bad camera, petrol, oil, diesel and your mom
735 2018-03-06 22:34:22 After 3 months I'm just now seeing my rosehip seed oil says to refrigerate. Should I throw it out?
736 2018-03-06 22:33:55 My bestfriend got me castor oil recently and I apply it with a spooli? brush, it works great and the oily skin from T doesnt affect it. Just leave it on for 30 min and then wash it off
737 2018-03-06 22:33:50 Did you just take credit for the shale oil boom?
738 2018-03-06 22:33:43 Or stop using your oil based computer.  Stop using medical equipment made from oil..such hypocritical ppl
739 2018-03-06 22:33:37 I just enjoy the fact that calcio with barely any economic might compared to prem and oil tycoons can still offer great substance and quality
740 2018-03-06 22:33:34 honestly with just olive oil and salt is my favourite way to eat avocado tho
741 2018-03-06 22:33:28 ayaw matanggal nung oil sa ntbk apfjwodbwoe

743 2018-03-06 22:33:11 But its easy. u just fry the chicken with no oil, till its brown.. then either dip in or o tshasa hela the sauce, then you grill in the oven. take out after atleast 7 to 10mins then tshasa again and let it cool for a bit.. you can use any kind of sauce u get from spar/woolies/etc
744 2018-03-06 22:33:05 I know exactly what you mean except it’s olive oil & imported tuna.
745 2018-03-06 22:32:42 Sorry, I do my best... but I think a fluorescent light could give me a tan! I’m not exactly slathering myself in oil and laying in the front yard by anymeans
746 2018-03-06 22:32:42 I'm trying to figure out how to make chicken without oil and no baking pan im too tired for this
747 2018-03-06 22:32:41 Owt haha! They're like a deep fat fryer, but you only hoy a spoonful of oil in and it works it's magic. Reading the reviews online, everyone says they're fab (with the occasional exception of course!)

749 2018-03-06 22:32:16 I've been slacking on my skin care lately... yesterday morning I did a sheet mask, face oil, face lotion, THEN put on my sun oil...

755 2018-03-06 22:31:48 And the farmers are picking up the cost again, because the railways are making more money hauling oil then grain. The BC #NDP need to get the pipeline deal done. And the #NDP wonder why they can not get rural support. DUH. #cndpoli #bcpoli #skpoli
756 2018-03-06 22:31:42 At $100/45ml of CBD oil, this is great news!!

768 2018-03-06 22:30:22 THey used protesters rights as a foil. You can't be so naive to believe the US put sanctions on them to help the people? No. It's all about oil baby and you know it.
769 2018-03-06 22:30:20 Same oil shoes from last year?
770 2018-03-06 22:30:19 Like the USA - we only care if they HAVEN'T got oil to sell to us.....

772 2018-03-06 22:30:14 Lips never sweat and are always pimple-free. That’s right, our lips do not have any sweat glands or oil glands, so they don’t perspire and they won’t break out.

776 2018-03-06 22:30:00 This poor baby should be home with her mother. 

Why must the human species be so heartless, greedy and arrogant to believe that we own the world and it's limited resources?

We don't even need palm oil. 

So sad.
777 2018-03-06 22:29:59 Usher and marriage is like oil and water.
778 2018-03-06 22:29:56 Kind of like never changing the oil in a car, and celebrating you had to buy a new car rather than focus on the screwup that led to the engine seizing ...l
779 2018-03-06 22:29:56 Tea tree oil and rose water. !
780 2018-03-06 22:29:55 Yes I think oil is perhaps easier than insurance.
781 2018-03-06 22:29:54 then why hasn’t he called me up to oil his head yet
782 2018-03-06 22:29:35 Scottish oil wealth used to pay the benefits of those forced onto "the sick", many of those who would be sanctioned half to death by IDS and Osborne when the Tories got in again and attacked the very same communities with austerity

784 2018-03-06 22:29:31 We have far stricter human rights standards, let alone environmental regulations, than even developed countries like America and Britain, much more so than developing countries like Russia, Saudi, Venezuela, and Qatar that supply most of the world's oil
785 2018-03-06 22:29:14 Who knows a good body shimmer oil?
786 2018-03-06 22:28:58 Yeah CA is one of the only states Damon Said you can file class action for anything, he wanted that deal so if he’s afraid I guarantee it’s a prob out there!
787 2018-03-06 22:28:49 A mechanic showing me the dipstick after an oil change is the automotive equivalent of a waiter making me try the wine before they pour the glass.
788 2018-03-06 22:28:36 Everytime i get a oil change i get hit on. every. single. time.
789 2018-03-06 22:28:10 “...lubrication to the engine, or lack of oil, I can't overturn that. However, I am researching further to see what other options you may have in terms of some sort of appeal. ^KB”
790 2018-03-06 22:27:53 What do you mean? @SpeakerRyan is supposed to work for the people? Ok, Ryan you can get out of the skimpy maid’s outfit and put the massage oil down. You’re master Trump will just have to understand that you don’t work for him. Got it?
791 2018-03-06 22:27:52 Basically what I am getting at is that BC would be hurt if Jason Kenny gets in and takes action on BC oil and gas because of the NDP / Greens actions on Kinder Morgan. It’s undeniable. I think Bob would agree
792 2018-03-06 22:27:50 I can’t imagine being a mechanic of any kind man. I throw a fit every single time I change my oil and smash my hand against something 

Shoutout to all the mechanics out there you’re all the real MVP’s
793 2018-03-06 22:27:40 Adding more oil tankers to an oil tanker, oil spill problem is a lot like giving teachers in the US guns, to add more bullets to an already bad situation. It makes even less sense.
794 2018-03-06 22:27:37 If you Google image search oil lamp bird you'll see the sort of thing I'm guessing it might be 
795 2018-03-06 22:27:36 Why is Bill Nye condemning Alberta's oil sands?
796 2018-03-06 22:27:33 I need a hot oil treatment
797 2018-03-06 22:27:30 It's a mixture--capitalist free-market with broad safety nets. Unlike Denmark, our economy isn't entirely propped up by oil (petrodollar concerns notwithstanding).
798 2018-03-06 22:27:28 Glad PSG are out dirty oil money club
799 2018-03-06 22:27:22 I bought the matching perfume oil to my current favourite candle and am...frankly astonished to find it makes me smell like a...candle.
800 2018-03-06 22:27:09 I’m sorry but I just ate this guys cookies that he left by the tv at the Walmart while I get my oil changed. I deadass thought it was a free sample or something

803 2018-03-06 22:26:54 Bullshit oil corporate propaganda.
804 2018-03-06 22:26:43 Also, buy ready cooked chicken, bag of salad, shake up soy sauce, sesame oil, lime juice, honey, garlic, ginger and chilli flakes in a jar. Put chicken/salad in bowl, pour on dressing.

810 2018-03-06 22:26:04 I wish the U.S. would allow people like me to buy that Gasoline Now! Stop buying Petroleum from Foreign Countries, and the prices will go down! Prices are Rising Again! Use our Oil Reserves to provide Gasoline in our own Country!
811 2018-03-06 22:26:00 no offense. we are on a roast session today. but Loving Vincent deserved to win over C0C0. Im unsure as to why other animation students dont agree with me, but i guess go paint 65,000 oil paintings trying to emulate the style of one artist, and then get back to me.
812 2018-03-06 22:26:00 Income from oil, tourism, banking, whisky et al are stolen by ingland. Nat Debt run up by Tories. If we get rid of you lot we'll pay it easy
813 2018-03-06 22:25:48 Being serious now....it does kind of look like an old oil lamp but looks really heavily cast? Is it iron or brass?
814 2018-03-06 22:25:44 Put a slice of butter and the olive oil in the pan in let it cook with the bell peppers
815 2018-03-06 22:25:32 I’m sure Bill Nye has been to California where they have been producing the dirtiest oil for decades. Curious why he doesn’t mention that.
816 2018-03-06 22:25:29 If you don't think 18-year-olds are mature enough to own an AK-47 or an AR-15, then quit sending them to war to die for oil.
817 2018-03-06 22:25:24 #PSG is a very small club with lots of oil money to throw about #wastefully
818 2018-03-06 22:25:18 the layer of oil on your exposed, acne-riddled skin adds a unique sheen
819 2018-03-06 22:25:18 Our problem is our Nigerian selves,despite global practices,we still try to find shortcuts- hat is why Nigerian banks,oil coys take contract staff who are not tied to employee benefits &pension. It is majorly a Nigerian thing. We just love to pay low even if value created is high
820 2018-03-06 22:25:16 We had hamburger meat bell peppers and white rice and virgin olive oil and so I cut the bell peppers up
821 2018-03-06 22:24:54 Yeah - that's what I say. Half of the population of Iraq is not able to vote or hold office. America hating Iran is an Iraq ally - and Iraq won't allow American companies to bid on their oil (although they are negotiating with China)!
822 2018-03-06 22:24:52 Got a note from someone in Senate Health and Welfare that Chairman Heider announced yesterday's meeting was improper. He's asked that yesterday's vote re: CBD oil be set aside. Not clear what's next. #idleg
823 2018-03-06 22:24:50 What really separates these Oklahoma oil barons from Saudi sheiks? Nothing really.
824 2018-03-06 22:24:48 @SpeakerRyan You continue to betray us as your globalist socialist masters can’t have fair trade, can’t have America producing our own oil and steel, can’t have a middle-class. We are awake and will no longer re-elect mediocre failures.
825 2018-03-06 22:24:37 70 years time. No oil needed. Thus the demise of the Arab hierarchy. And you will still be churning out rubbish
826 2018-03-06 22:24:34 こちらこそありがとうございます、よろしくお願いします！
827 2018-03-06 22:24:34 Is this good? Maybe, until we run out of oil, again.
828 2018-03-06 22:24:26 Thank you to everyone who joined us this morning for the APAC Oil & Gas Outlook. A very special thank you to Hilco for sponsoring! More info on how to access the recording will be available in the next few days.
829 2018-03-06 22:24:13 No that's what the west propaganda tells you. There was an economic coup designed to attack Ven's economy while it was down and take back control of its nationalised oil industry.The US have damaged their people more than socialism ever could. You need to expand your media intake
830 2018-03-06 22:24:06 "Ethical oil"...nice virtue signalling.
831 2018-03-06 22:24:00 BOOM on oil

832 2018-03-06 22:23:59 Fresh herb n garlic, vinegar, oil, bay scallops, with lomein noodles and stir fry veggies is what's for dinner.
833 2018-03-06 22:23:58 I am a very reasonable chanklish.. And knowing that we borh share our view about the milk/cereal issue.. I am ready to share some chanko if you bring onion or tomatoes with olive oil
834 2018-03-06 22:23:44 Let's not forget how past 30%+ oil imports posed security risk to US for decades...
Trump is totally right US 30% steel imports is definitely a security risk!
835 2018-03-06 22:23:38 Take a breath. Take your meds. Go clean and oil a rifle or whatever you do to relax. You seem jumpy.

837 2018-03-06 22:23:24 Girl vitamin e oil, tea tree oil, rosehip oil, aloe vera, and witch hazel toners with rose water are so good for you!!!
838 2018-03-06 22:23:14 i've tried that! and tea tree oil! and even keloid medicine my doctor gave me and it won't go away and if anything it just keeps getting bigger. IDK WHAT TO DO
839 2018-03-06 22:23:05 Use your head man, there's high level reason for the slow-down in #economic growth since the financial crash of 2008 globally: Er, triggering irreversible #Climatechange & destroying our planet.
Shhh! Don't tell the #airline, #oil, #transport, etc #companies or their shareholders
840 2018-03-06 22:23:04 Are you under the mistaken idea, your heating oil & vehicular gas come from bitumen to be shipped to China? Well, no wonder you're concerned. Rest assured. There are plenty of lines in place already until we're onto more life-sustaining avenues.

844 2018-03-06 22:22:39 AKA Ben Barson, I'll replace ya heart valve w/ valvoline motor oil, cause nigga you think you slick
845 2018-03-06 22:22:36 Is that one of those scented oil diffusers?
846 2018-03-06 22:22:32 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
847 2018-03-06 22:22:28 I love oil spills! Nothing really slaps mother nature across the face like a billion gallons of crude!  The fact that most of Earth is water....and somehow we damn near polluted all of it ....whew... take a bow!
848 2018-03-06 22:22:26 On carbon capture, Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub says some things you have to do regardless of the oil price because “it’s just the right thing to do.” #CERAWeek
849 2018-03-06 22:22:01 How about the tech oil guy right here? lmao. Your tech is awesome btw.  calculating volumn with shadows... cudos
850 2018-03-06 22:21:58 Followed closely by the 2008 Lehman bust. Paid up back by hiking the price of oil.
851 2018-03-06 22:21:50 The stuff I feed my cat is: Fish Broth, Mackerel, Sea Bream, Whitefish, Chicken, Carrots, Sunflower Oil, Modified Tapioca Starch, Dried Egg Product, Natural Flavors, Pea Protein, Sardines, Tricalcium Phosphate, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Chloride, Taurine, Spinach...
852 2018-03-06 22:21:49 Aloe vera helped a scar I had on my leg. I've heard that shea butter and coconut oil can help scars too.
853 2018-03-06 22:21:45 omg, oil your brakes. I would get the highways to put more bollards  up so the cars etc can't get through to park. until this changes I think you could put obstacles in the way to prevent this. like traffic cones.

855 2018-03-06 22:21:35 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
856 2018-03-06 22:21:32 It's oil paint but thinned down. We're not allowed to use white so have to build up colours. My wife's painting is great, she's so chuffed with it. 
857 2018-03-06 22:21:11 I understood he became a Billionaire in the oil industry. Hmmm, so it appears he has lost touch with reality and a candidate for the Billionaire Baker Act...

859 2018-03-06 22:21:03 I think the nastiest thing they found was bleach, preferably in the oil
860 2018-03-06 22:20:50 wow i can drink so much oil
861 2018-03-06 22:20:47 I use CBD in vape, do they have an oil that is vape friendly? Didn't see one
862 2018-03-06 22:20:42 
863 2018-03-06 22:20:30 In favor of continuous assessment. China finishes a 1,900-meter pipeline to pump oil from Russia /via.
864 2018-03-06 22:20:27 Need to hurry up and get an oil change 
865 2018-03-06 22:20:10 م اقدر
866 2018-03-06 22:20:05 i’ll pack sunscreen for you and tanning oil for me
867 2018-03-06 22:19:57 Getting my oil changed. Just watched this tall employee try to squeeze into my tiny, short-person car. Quite a funny site.
868 2018-03-06 22:19:56 Well that sucks for sure! I'm kinda in the same boat. While getting an oil change I found out it needs the wheel bearing fixed($500 @ best); but hey it doesn't need an oil change now lol! Cars, sucks to have them; sucks to be without them too.
869 2018-03-06 22:19:56 I've been using the same $7 off an oil change since 2014 lmao
870 2018-03-06 22:19:37 So heartbreaking to see orangutans suffer for us and our habits. Keeping away from palm oil isn’t easy since most products have palm oil but doable.

874 2018-03-06 22:19:25 no right thinking soul wants more oil. Clean energy is what we want. There is no security in your plan, it is only about making the rich richer. You don't have a clue what the citizens, the majority of citizens want, and you are a master liar along with the GOP.
875 2018-03-06 22:19:25 Sileo and a great idea is like oil and water
876 2018-03-06 22:19:18 And the State Department closed their office dealing in Cyber Warfare a few months back. That’s why Putin insisted on Tillerson instead of Romney to be SoS. They’re old friends in the oil industry.

878 2018-03-06 22:19:11 Thom getting lathered up about projections. You are a snake oil salesman, @DSzymborski!
879 2018-03-06 22:19:08 I honestly feel like a snake oil salesman when I try to explain the benefits to people but it’s honestly true. It’s helped me in a lot of ways.
880 2018-03-06 22:19:01 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
881 2018-03-06 22:18:58 If it acts like trump, propagandizes like trump & has no info to depart like trump... it's pretty close to trump. Ironically, Alberta's dependance on oil sector is directly tied to THIS same message initially used decades ago when we could have started the move to renewables.
882 2018-03-06 22:18:57 Que colgado me quedé sin gas oil en la camioneta jaja a caminar 
883 2018-03-06 22:18:56 I use Thayer's witch hazel toner. It doesn't dry out my skin and makes my face feel "fresh". I also swear by jojoba oil and Dr. Bronners soap. I have finicky skin and these 3 have served me best, longest.
884 2018-03-06 22:18:55 I was just responding to folks substituting palm oil for tomato
885 2018-03-06 22:18:24 There are still some verses to be written: chaplains, oil rig workers, lighthouse keepers...
886 2018-03-06 22:18:19 An interesting perspective on media reporting of oil spills. We haul based on cubic meters and production is reported on barrels. Yet spills are often stated in liters. Today, my company will haul 6 loads with tractor/tridem trailers...
887 2018-03-06 22:18:16 I have tiger balm and i have the Asian oil one too. I’ll try it thanks guys 
888 2018-03-06 22:18:12 Why? We have enough already pumped and in storage facilities and capped active wells.. We have enough to last 150 years without drilling more. Use whats on hand. Develop more non fossil energy or we will destroy ourselves anrrd our
environment
 Our oil barons know this.

891 2018-03-06 22:17:56 Great album lads! Danny voice sounds great. Snake oil is a class song look forward to hearing that 1 when me and my mates come to see you on the 5th April Birmingham !! 
892 2018-03-06 22:17:45 Coconut oil is actually a life saver
893 2018-03-06 22:17:28 Didn’t ask anyone not to cook with palm oil.

895 2018-03-06 22:17:19 €1bn of oil money can buy some handy players for banging 6 past French diddies every other week, but it certainly doesn't get you a spine. #PSG

897 2018-03-06 22:17:04 @AdamCarollaShow hi!..I have a 1995 Mitsubishi 3000gt Vr4 Twin Turbo i was wondering if any of your oils can solve my annoying lifter tick issue? My Lifters have holes that are to small for oil, don’t feel like swapping for big bore lifters #CastrolChallenge
898 2018-03-06 22:17:01 I'm from Italy and I didn't know I could put on olive oil to tame my hair! But I guess I must make a naughty sex tape before
899 2018-03-06 22:16:56 I have some pretty 'radical' ideas for a post independent Scotland. Along with an oil fund, I would create a national security hedge fund. If the rUK threatened Scotland, it would look to short Sterling or take over FTSE companies, rebrand then relocate HQs to Edinburgh. Nice.
900 2018-03-06 22:16:45 Ethical and oil in the same sentence LMFAO
901 2018-03-06 22:16:37 The notion that a club can just receive an investment by the owners and they’ll suddenly be good is constantly crapped on by PSG. If “oil money” were the answer, PSG wouldn’t suck so much in the UCL

903 2018-03-06 22:16:23 Nothing better than a spiritual black woman loving on you. You'd be ready to oil her feet and feed her strawberries
904 2018-03-06 22:16:22 There are just some things we can’t cook without palm oil. Tomato doesn’t seem like a direct substitute
905 2018-03-06 22:16:11 Tip #3 When shaving your vajay DON'T use shaving cream OR coconut butter! Use Johnson's baby oil or shampoo instead. You'll be razor burn free.
906 2018-03-06 22:16:03 NO, we used  N Se oil to destroy industry and communities, while growing a class of 'Sids', industry hobbled on, grew in some areas, withered in others; no one I know in industry thinks Brexit will do anything except shrink their business
907 2018-03-06 22:15:58 Relatively strong words (for a conference panel) from Hollub on carbon capture: “Some things you just have to do regardless of the oil price, it’s just the right thing to do.”

910 2018-03-06 22:15:28 Mom was cooking. Then suddenly, I heard the oil sizzle and I look for her phone because "Cooking Cooking" of #superjunior is her ring tone. I thought, her mobile phone is ringing. 
911 2018-03-06 22:15:21 The term therapeutic grade is generally associated with marketing paid for by million $ companies. There is no established canon for essential oil & aromatherapy facts, but there are credible reports, published research and standards that pass scientific muster. #TuesdayThoughts
912 2018-03-06 22:15:17 Oil.
913 2018-03-06 22:15:12 I already *said* we should be subsidizing nuclear as much, if not MORE than these other techs, as it's clearly better than other green energy but people have been trained to think nuclear is dangerous. But why are we STILL subsidizing oil and coal and gas?
914 2018-03-06 22:15:05 That nigga in the Fifty Shades movie don't be letting the pussy rest, He keep it hot on his wife  I kno that lil red room smelt like ass, oil and leather

916 2018-03-06 22:14:45 Not only is Pruitt flying first class on our dollar, but doing it with oil executives. Disgusting trump, lying bastard.  Draining the swamp?? filling it with shi...  Shame or as he would say SAD.  How can u people still support this rapist of our economy
917 2018-03-06 22:14:32 You’re trading! Try selling an oil fund to a French, Italian or German institution.  Rough. Broking seems to be OK but fund management and insurance are very protected
918 2018-03-06 22:14:21 Only for a few years, then the oil runs out and then what are we going to do since you and the Republicans aren't interested in trying to find alternative sources of energy.

920 2018-03-06 22:13:50 One of the most common questions is: Are your oils “therapeutic grade?” That is a misleading phrase. It implies there's a grading scale that determines if oil is suitable for aromatherapy. There is no such standard. The best rule to apply is a scientific standard #TruthSeekers

923 2018-03-06 22:13:07 Is the us overproducing oil and dumping it on the market to keep the price down. Maybe some tariffs should be considered?
924 2018-03-06 22:13:05 always oil your hair before a sew in and clip your ends

935 2018-03-06 22:11:58 I trade oil internationally and have never had any problems related to language in France when either buying from or selling to French companies. Is it industry specific?
936 2018-03-06 22:11:55 Chucky...you always misrepresent the facts!  Chevron already pays well, and provides great benefits!  Shareholders deserve something for investing, after oil has taken a beating! You totally left out the FACT they are going to invest BILLIONS over 10 years, which creates jobs!
937 2018-03-06 22:11:43 @PSG_English with a typical performance today. Small club. Foreign oil money. Absolute trash.

946 2018-03-06 22:10:31 And to your point, yes, the recession and near recessions of all the oil producing States shows they lost investment as well, despite their lack of climate change strategies

948 2018-03-06 22:10:26 I’m such a sloth - canceled car oil change because a storm is coming, stopped at the pharmacy and went to a bookstore, bought “The Elegance of the Hedgehog,” because I’m 10 years behind in my reading and a snowstorm is good reading weather.

952 2018-03-06 22:10:10 The investor confidence damage has long been done. The majority of our oil and gas flows to the US not through BC. BC must ship gas through Alberta. This is about enforcing the rule of law.

955 2018-03-06 22:10:01 And you clearly don't realize that Stone chose this show because he could get away with balderdash and sales for snake oil.

981 2018-03-06 22:06:51 I guess you have no idea who Peter Lougheed was. He denied permits for oil and gas and it was all shut down for transport to Eastern Canada. Pretty simple solution. Trudeau 1.0 caved and canceled National Energy Program he foolishly rammed on Alberta. Same rule applies here.
982 2018-03-06 22:06:46 So how many plastic badniks, rings, ring holders and rocks will we need if we use every track piece (Green Hill, Metallic Madness, Oil Ocean and Metropolis) in one go? Will we also get a 5 slot ring stacker for racers and a 3 slot ring stacker for bosses?
983 2018-03-06 22:06:29 I think it’s so easy to go too hard on the olive oil. I always kind of cover the spout with my finger and put in much less than you think you need. Just enough to gloss it.

994 2018-03-06 22:04:59 whats the colour of the equipment?

but doesn't matter, imho. its XTO's oil not schlumberger/cameron's. their oil, their responsibility.
995 2018-03-06 22:04:44 my brothers always complain about how I can never cook rice properly. So today I made oil rice thinking it was gonna come out real bad, but it was actually amazing. ANYWAY I went to the kitchen to eat some, I OPENED THE BOWL AND THE WHOLE RICE WAS GONE.
996 2018-03-06 22:04:44 Dude. Basil, garlic, grated cheese, oil and pine nuts. No parsley. And certainly not a necessity. I side with the younger Steere on this subject.
997 2018-03-06 22:04:44 Nat gas contract prices are linked to oil...
998 2018-03-06 22:04:41 From Network (NW) theory: Effective Size of NW  = Actual Size of NW – Redundancy. Redundancy = highly interconnected part of your NW. Redundancy also has less information content - e.g. you can get almost the same amount of info from 10 oil & gas folks compared to 100 folks.
999 2018-03-06 22:04:33 So are you saying Scotland sells none of it's food, drink and many other products,  around the world. Are you implying no one but England would buy our oil. 
1000 2018-03-06 22:04:21 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-03-06, is 6.95.
1001 2018-03-06 22:04:17 Of course we can. It’s called permitting. The government approves all permits for all oil and gas via pipelines..you did know this right? Oh you don’t..my bad.
1002 2018-03-06 22:04:12 Get on the CBD oil bill. 1000 mg at least.
1003 2018-03-06 22:04:09 @GlamLifeGuru I just watched all 52:15 of your video on your supplements. I have to say I appreciate your thoroughness and transparency. I take supplements daily (whole food prenatal, cod liver oil, probiotic), I also juice and try to eat healthy often. I’ll be purchasing soon.

1007 2018-03-06 22:03:59 He's a smart guy he's good with charts and he knows a lot of markets.

He got out of sync with oil in a really visible way and now he's done same on equities.

Problem is his primary business is getting money for being DG. It's not trading. He's soft.

1010 2018-03-06 22:03:36 Most of US production is condensate, plant condensate and heavy oil selling at huge discount to WTI. This explains the underperformance of shale companies.
1011 2018-03-06 22:03:27 Even more room for oil 
1012 2018-03-06 22:03:27 Now, I feel happy that the tires are fixed and my car oil changed already!
1013 2018-03-06 22:03:18 ........this is why an Oil price of around $62 pb is about as high as it gets!
1014 2018-03-06 22:03:18 Only ppl these policies don't help are the billionaire investors/oil magnates. You really trust THEM? You'd be compliant w/ policies that are hurting YOU to further enrich people who already own enough for a lifetime. Stop idolizing the wealthy as benevolent masters; they're not.
1015 2018-03-06 22:03:15 Because, way back in 1995 (Barcelona Declaration) and before that too contracts were signed by the U.K. which guaranteed Muslims right to settle and pursue their culture here and Europe, in exchange for oil.

1019 2018-03-06 22:02:55 Here is one way to help as a city. Rent and house prices are greatly inflated by the high pay rates the Oil industry offered. You need to help lower the cost of living to accomadate the much lower incomes that will happen as the economy reorginizes itself. $15-22hr mean.

1024 2018-03-06 22:02:31 The Kinder Morgan expansion isn`t about feeding a domestic market or our society`s transportation currently running on oil, it`s about putting the extra in oil tankers and shipping it to Asia through our waters.
1025 2018-03-06 22:02:28 The last time I got my oil changed it was 2016

1031 2018-03-06 22:02:00 What, Manning exposed war crimes in IRaq. We went into Libya at the behest of France, to topple ghadafi and steal his oil and his gold and install a west friendly dictator.
1032 2018-03-06 22:01:51 well, Cheney finally got what he wanted. he's the pres of an oil co. digging off cyprus & in israel.
1033 2018-03-06 22:01:22 You realize we love the environment as well. My Kenney would simply deny permits for all oil and gas pipelines while we do a thorough safety and environmental review. I would imagine 3-4 weeks would surface. It may cause some hardships. No planes at YVR, ferries, shipping stops.

1044 2018-03-06 22:00:18 A truly scary prospect - everyone (including energy companies) needs to understand that the radical green movement doesn't want carbon reductions, they want our oil and gas left in the ground. Forever. No more appeasement or trying to win social license - it is a futile effort.

1088 2018-03-06 21:55:43 Yes I think it's an example of unconscious bias. It does have a whiff of something dodgy.  Like "snake oil salesman spruiks his wares".  Headlines are important.  Weatherill deserves a better one here.

It's time our politicians use facts
1108 2018-03-06 21:52:55 If you add all 4 numbers oil, gas, cushing and distillates and the difference is less than 3 mln. better not to trade at all as the price can go back. It is applicable both for API and EIA, but in EIA you calculate 3 mln. difference with API. Now the difference ~1,7 mln down/up.

1129 2018-03-06 21:50:23 Lmaooo. I’ve seen videos where they had to cut people’s muscle out because of all the oil. It’s crazy
1130 2018-03-06 21:50:23 That’s some BS. Man I wish I could help! I still think rheum but don’t cancel anything that’s for sure. I feel ur pain (literally!). Fish oil is supposed to help but it’s not dramatic; you need real meds too
1131 2018-03-06 21:50:12 Oh well all those oil fueled teams will disappear in a few years anyhow.
1132 2018-03-06 21:50:05 The point is that when the SNP complain about the lack of an oil fund, they conveniently forget about their part in destroying the basis on which it could have been set up ...
1133 2018-03-06 21:50:05 Argan oil ithengwa phi? Ingakhona kwa Clicks?
1134 2018-03-06 21:50:03 I have to look closer at CPG,yet it is a fact that the US just produces 2.2mill bbl per day of WTI(API 37-42).Everything else is condensate,plant condensate and heavy oil.
1135 2018-03-06 21:50:02 It bought City the title, cos if it wasn't for oil money they would be in league 2 by now 
1136 2018-03-06 21:50:00 Yep I am referring to your 70% statement. 85% of Venezuela economy is oil industry. PDVSA is own by the state so your statement is completely wrong and not just because of that
1137 2018-03-06 21:50:00 You have too!! It’s saved my skin! That and tamuna oil! You’ll love it promise it’s all organic cold pressed and pure it kills the bacteria in the skin
1138 2018-03-06 21:49:46 Oil and natural gas prices rose today,so psg has something to celebrate #PSGREAL
1139 2018-03-06 21:49:45 @PSG_inside My advice: Go for Experience and not Superstars. Spend your Oil money wisely.
1140 2018-03-06 21:49:17 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
1141 2018-03-06 21:49:16 Too late.  Here's your oil.
1142 2018-03-06 21:49:10 So BMW contacted me, clearly the message wasn't for me
But Alysson from Richmond, your BMW is due soon for an oil change
1143 2018-03-06 21:48:37 Treasonous criminal lobby orgs direct the u.s. gov don't speak up cause they were bribed, benefit& escape prison by blaming russia.

1144 2018-03-06 21:48:25 PSG fans thought that by firing shots outside the hotel they would win. Little did they know that it is Real Madrid who fire the shots on field when it is a UCL night and their oil daddies from Qatar could do nothing about it. #HalaMadrid
#PSGREAL #UCL
1145 2018-03-06 21:48:23 Just tell 'em it's patchouli oil.
1146 2018-03-06 21:48:21 Watch the Gulf Coast instead of Cushing. That's where the oil revolution is taking place, as foretold by @oilfractals (and of course the builds going on there).
1147 2018-03-06 21:48:18 After all the oil i just had pop on me these pot stickers better be good
1148 2018-03-06 21:48:15 need to buy more shea butter and castor oil 
1149 2018-03-06 21:47:58 It's NOT just the "eco radicals" dude.....you & the oil guzzlers don't have a clue. #cluelessCons
1150 2018-03-06 21:47:57 PSG oil project is done 

Madrid obviously showing their superior quality
1151 2018-03-06 21:47:52 Well, my back's slightly more loose. Clicky in a good way after 4 caps of oil. Pain's eased a bit. Hope I can walk to see the dog tmw.
1152 2018-03-06 21:47:29 Emery has to be one of the biggest frauds of all-time. Europa League merchant. Nasser finna light up an oil barrel on his ass tonight.
1153 2018-03-06 21:47:26 Tonight in Paris...  Burning plastic mixed with Arab oil... So, this is that strong PSG? Don't make me laugh! One and only the greatest ever Real Madrid! #RealPSG #PSG #RealMadrid #HalaMadrid #APorLa13  (agg 2-5)
1154 2018-03-06 21:47:23 Will be offering massage with CBD oil soon! It's a life saver and great for pain and anxiety !
1155 2018-03-06 21:47:17 Nice to see an oil money team going out, #psgmadrid
1156 2018-03-06 21:47:10 1. Spelling and grammar is important. But in a debate, the idea is what counts. 
2. You ignore the fact that UK and US oil companies used to own Ven. oil  until the people chose socialism, since then western powers through sanctions & propaganda have tried to destroy it's economy
1157 2018-03-06 21:47:00 also does serving private companies oil interests in the middle east make you feel better? Nonce
1158 2018-03-06 21:46:58 Mark Conradi (ABQMR) just gave a talk entitled "Earth's Field NMR to detect spilled oil released under ice." #panic2018 Yes, it involved helicopters.
1159 2018-03-06 21:46:44 Not a fan of exporting our energy reserves. What will the future Americans use for their energy needs? Or is today $$ in oil cos pockets more important than future American generations?
1160 2018-03-06 21:46:41 @BillNye why Canada? Why come to Canada and tell us the pipeline is bad? Why not go to Nigeria or Russia and tell them how their pipelines are bad? Canada has some of the best policies for bringing oil out of the ground but for some reason it’s ok for every other country?
1161 2018-03-06 21:46:39 USA is holding the oil fields
1162 2018-03-06 21:46:30 Who do you use for oil?
1163 2018-03-06 21:46:29 I just got palm oil on my white shirt. It will now officially become my “house” shirt
1164 2018-03-06 21:46:27 Lost complete interest in European football since we went out watched 10 minutes eh that PSG v Madrid game they can all fuck off oil money burning bastards 
1165 2018-03-06 21:46:25 PSG remains a small team in Europe even with their Oil money #UCL
1166 2018-03-06 21:46:25 Cbd oil taste like shite
1167 2018-03-06 21:46:25 PSG give honest, hard working oil money clubs like City a bad name.
1168 2018-03-06 21:46:21 And yet you still can’t fill your stadium. Perhaps your rich oil sugar daddy could buy you more fans? 
1169 2018-03-06 21:46:07 Babyoil! Buckets of! Big barrels of baby oil! (If you knew my real name)! 
1170 2018-03-06 21:46:03 Got a car wash , oil change, vacuum, brake pads, gas  NINI IS FEELING GREAT
1171 2018-03-06 21:45:59 Yup, oil is the future. You’re a visionary.
1172 2018-03-06 21:45:57 wish i would have used coconut oil sooner cus this shit is bomb.
1173 2018-03-06 21:45:49 Well, yeah. Duh. He got the job didn’t he? He has been doing business with and in Russia for decades, as CEO of the giant Exxon-Mobile Oil Company.
1174 2018-03-06 21:45:46 If EIA says 6+ million build tomorrow on top of rising production I do not think $60 will hold by end of this week.
Hedge funds are 90% net long.  $XOM and $CVX are both underperfoming oil prices also. They tend to be leading indicators.
1175 2018-03-06 21:45:41 If you add all 4 numbers oil, gas, cushing and distillates and difference is less than 3 mln. better not to trade at all as the price can go back. It is applicable both for API and EIA, but in EIA you calculate 3 mln. difference with API.
1176 2018-03-06 21:45:38 Because the large oil producers are either collapsing as a society because of oil or they are turning to renewables.
1177 2018-03-06 21:45:37 We may produce oil but if we don’t build new refineries the old junk that we have down to Texas will not suffice
1178 2018-03-06 21:45:27 This guy is nothing but a Snake Oil salesman !  Canada can survive on solar energy and wind mills alone ? Hahahahahaha
1179 2018-03-06 21:45:25 It still means nothing. Where has oil been building? Why....a look at Gulf Coast storage tells you the real story on oil. Cushing no longer has relevance IMO.
1180 2018-03-06 21:45:23 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
1181 2018-03-06 21:45:22 Is that Jerry after working in the oil rigs for a day?
1182 2018-03-06 21:45:19 I hate this club, hate with more passion than any other.
No History, No right to be that wealthy, none of that finances earned at all, disgusting pile of  oil owned shit

1187 2018-03-06 21:45:06 Malaysian officials indicate that the ongoing FTA talks between Malaysia and the EU are at risk as long as the EU doesn’t address its tariffs on palm oil. Malaysia is amongst the world’s top exporters of palm oil #FTAs #GlobalKnowledge
1188 2018-03-06 21:45:03 OK...2 things
1. Watch Cushing ...this is where heavier grades are stored and the US has been exporting from (this is the smallest draw in weeks)
2. It is refinery maintenance season..we *should* be seeing draws **note this is the first reported draw since the season began #oil
1189 2018-03-06 21:45:00 Everybody's always complaining about blowing dirt out of their noses at fests. Wear a bandana over your face and put peppermint oil on it religiously. Love yourself damn it.
1190 2018-03-06 21:45:00 Big show tonight at @ArlenesGrocery, sharing with the band #Oil starting at 7pm! I'll be hitting the stage at 8 with a set featuring my latest song "New Old Friends." Should be another great night in #NYC!!
1191 2018-03-06 21:44:57 If only you could buy CL with arab oil money.
1192 2018-03-06 21:44:52 Is this your way of handling the single most highest growth of the country.  A president that has done 65%  of what he set out to do in less than 2 years.  We are now heading toward being the number 1 oil exporter in the world, unlike #14 under Obama.  Yea!!  GET IT!
1193 2018-03-06 21:44:47 oil money can buy you the league but not the Champions League
1194 2018-03-06 21:44:42 A PSA to my family and friends: when I’m on my death bed, make sure I’m wearing rose-hip oil cause that stuff’s saved my life on multiple occasions
1195 2018-03-06 21:44:39 Maybe Zinke should loan his wife to lonely sailors — WTF, is he crazy? Oil should not be pumped in our parks.
1196 2018-03-06 21:44:31 What coconut oil vitamin do for your body!
1197 2018-03-06 21:44:28 I use very little oil these days. Externals only. I have more brushes than I could ever use. I have a problem!

1199 2018-03-06 21:44:15 @ezralevant We need to start a movement like MeToo. Call it Enough is Enough.  We need to get our energy program back on its feet, get back the National Energy Board, finish the pipeline to the west and stop trying to destroy our economy! Oil is not going away soon!

1201 2018-03-06 21:44:03 It's all rainy & sleeting. I gotta go get oil for my car & take Rose these flowers. So glad the bus was on time, I usually walk but I forgot my umbrella 
1202 2018-03-06 21:44:03 And you don't think asking your allies to come & help you in your oil wars isn't taking advantage of them? Are you & your companies going to stop buying crap from China & get it made in USA from now on? You are a hipocrit!
1203 2018-03-06 21:43:47 Anyone know where I can get a good cheap synthetic oil change in Denton?
1204 2018-03-06 21:43:47 They never talk bout the oil money fc,but they will be quick to talk bout the biggest club MUFC,cuz it makes them relevant
1205 2018-03-06 21:43:44 It's so funny all the Madrid fans shitting up PSG mentions calling them an oil club when Madrid is literally an oil club lmao
1206 2018-03-06 21:43:34 PSG are the french arsenal with money and oil.
1207 2018-03-06 21:43:28 Haha. Just needs some oil on it.....
1208 2018-03-06 21:43:25 I see Scott Pruitt (head of EPA who is anti environment, pro oil, and general douchebag) doesn't believe in the theory of evolution.

He is one in a long line of people who seem to think that you can choose and dismiss scientific theories depending on how they suit your beliefs
1209 2018-03-06 21:43:21 Maybe the premier could help us get a pipeline built so we aren’t dependent on one market for our oil the USA
1210 2018-03-06 21:43:18 oh, we thought oil has been pulling Zinke strings all along.

1212 2018-03-06 21:43:08 So let me get this straight the solution to the the "job killing" lack of pipeline capacity is to further limit the amount of oil moved to tide waters? This is as bad as the (well Wes you have offended Jews, Ukrainians and most the south Pacific, whats left?)

1223 2018-03-06 21:42:12 Saying that, I do respect Arsenal in that way. I support United and I believe we are the only clubs in England that actually use the money generated by the club and not some Oil money.
1224 2018-03-06 21:41:53 But a build. You'd think with a big gasoline draw that you'd see a draw. This is the reality of oil. Over supply.
1225 2018-03-06 21:41:52 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1226 2018-03-06 21:41:52 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1227 2018-03-06 21:41:52 You simply cannot purchase history with oil money. Au revoir.
1228 2018-03-06 21:41:51 Nothing against oil, it is an important resource for other manufacturing needs besides just gasoline. However, we should not turn a blind eye to alternative energy sources such as Solar, Wind, Nuclear, and Hydro. Limiting our energy to only one source is dangerous.
1229 2018-03-06 21:41:51 No fighting.  Well. Not here.  We're watching for U-boats.  If you want to fight go down to the brig.  We have a ring and some oil.  We have a guy who holds the money while we all bet.

1241 2018-03-06 21:41:08 I too won't touch them. I think we need to start tweeting the different names for Palm Oil just to remind people they are subscribing to deaths of so many creatures and our Planet.
1242 2018-03-06 21:40:58 No matter, oil price rose 2% yesterday

1270 2018-03-06 21:39:17 Yes. We are rich in resources and good at high tech, but we lack the middle supply chain. We should export processed fuel instead of raw oil. We should have our refineries to meet domestic demand and export the extra of the processed fuel.
1271 2018-03-06 21:39:11 Big oil would never allow it. Hollow rhetoric from hollow blowhard.

1418 2018-03-06 21:25:57 That's one oil club gone, 1 to go
1419 2018-03-06 21:25:50 I'm just going to go on record, for the 3 people who see my tweets, to say that I have always believed the #SteeleDossier. As is so much strife, our nation's strife is about oil money. Fuck oil.
1420 2018-03-06 21:25:43 Don’t work our Sheikh will hold it down and represent for the oil team this year in the champions league!
1421 2018-03-06 21:25:40 Shame to see an oil team getting a seeing to.
1422 2018-03-06 21:25:40 No possible corruption here, right?  Suppose the oil lobby will write the rules for the EPA?
1423 2018-03-06 21:25:39 Doubles up as an oil rig.
1424 2018-03-06 21:25:19 Perhaps it is time the US was reminded how much outgoing trade we have and vow much 10 percent tax on oil, gas and electricity will cost them.

1427 2018-03-06 21:25:10 Just saw a familiar face on North Dakota news. Happens to be same news anchor who told @JordanChariton that oil pipelines don’t leak during the DAPL protests. Well... segments of that pipeline have since leaked... so he’s changed his story to “More fracking hurts Russian economy”

1429 2018-03-06 21:24:40 When you're trying to change your oil and run out of vegetable, so you have to finish with canola.

You'll have to change it again sooner, but it'll do the job

1431 2018-03-06 21:24:35 I don't get how Quebec would prefer Oil to be transported via rail instead of pipeline.
1432 2018-03-06 21:24:31 Focus on long cycle oil production... US shale will not drive sustainable global energy production.  Look at the global production numbers by source.  And CAPEX in that context
1433 2018-03-06 21:24:21 That was a different era. This mob are classless, bought by oil money, will never buy them respectability. Same as buying the 3rd best player at Barca - shame for that little rat, eh.
1434 2018-03-06 21:24:12 More Nocera, discussing photosynthesis: 'No one told plants in 2.3 billion years they would.need to be oil wells.'
1435 2018-03-06 21:23:59 No. The idea with H2 is to move out oil and imported natural gas (reduce CO2 and improve energy security of supply) , and use renewable power as input energy source. This is not about using natural gas to produce H2!
1436 2018-03-06 21:23:39 Look at the second goal, which is probably not a save % issue, but how is anyone at fault other than 33.  But for his play, its a whistle and play is dead. There is no uncertainty about it. Sure if it happens 9 more times, the Oil defend it, but that still means a .900 sv%
1437 2018-03-06 21:23:33 When city get knocked out in the quarter finals it'll be oil free. Thank god.

1443 2018-03-06 21:22:31 Please watch out... remember that snake oil salesmen, are very good at their jobs... BUT still sale snake oil. 

I realize you’re young & sadly have been thrust into an arena full of snakes. They don’t all have your best interest in mind. I hope someone is helping you navigate.
1444 2018-03-06 21:22:28 We have become a sad and weak nation ruled by a mob (GOP ) and it's financiers (NRA, Koch Industries, big Pharma, Coal , Oil, etc). 
1445 2018-03-06 21:22:20 As a worker in the oil industry, we are already seeing a big pickup, due to a combination of a better oil price, decreased operating costs (thanks to the 2016 crash) &  the weak pound, which combine to make the NS reserves very attractive.
1446 2018-03-06 21:22:18 Retraction of a pro and con article? Really? Reminds me of econ student who said he’d get his oil ind’ry dad to get me fired, after I neutrally asked 2nd year Econ class if they knew the args Feds, prov and industry were making re NEP. #higherlearning
1447 2018-03-06 21:21:55 If all the billionaire libs don't like coal. Maybe put some of that mega money into developing fusion. We will no longer need to rely on coal, oil etc. Clean energy for next thousand years.
1448 2018-03-06 21:21:53 i bought an oil cartridge refill but it was the wrong one for my pen so I rolled a joint and used a lighter to melt to oil all over and I’m crying rn im in bliss

1465 2018-03-06 21:20:22 @justintrudeau this is so easy. His country take this oil from Canada @ $35 and sells it on world market for $66 and uses the difference to invest in renewable energy leaving Canada with no oil and no investment in renewables. That's why Bill! So stop trying to screw Canada

1475 2018-03-06 21:19:05 No movement on your hair line either. Time to give up on the propisia and what other type of snake oil you use on that head and act your age, but then you would need to accept that your wife is young enough to be your daughter.

Leave it drain for 10-15 minutes get more oil out.

1484 2018-03-06 21:18:23 @JustinTrudeau  & US takes that oil and exports it for $60 - $66 making a ton in profit that they roll part into building renewable energy leadership. US = SMART. CANADA=STUPID!
1485 2018-03-06 21:18:03 so what is solution?  If we're getting unrefined oil to tidewater, and so is US (with oil that is less expensive to get to tidewater) are our prices going to go up to world, or will the influx of new oil bring world prices down to what we're getting now (or lower?)

1512 2018-03-06 21:15:31 Olive oil is not harmful. My cat had some dry bits on one of his paws, and the vet told me to use olive or coconut oil to moisturize his paw pad. :( Maybe your cat was walking on some rough surface? I hope that helps. ><

If we can't beat them at their game, we have to change the game, not try to get in on it.  Is there an under-refined product? (ie: solid jet fuel) we can make?

1552 2018-03-06 21:11:49 I suppose PSG are the Man City of French football, so it is kinda nice to see them get knocked out. Oil money cunts.
1553 2018-03-06 21:11:47 Like I said before, PSG are a tinpot club relevant only because of oil money. They were never a challenge for the best club the world. Verrati getting sent off is just icing on the cake. Hopefully Neymar makes the right decision, coming to Madrid.

1558 2018-03-06 21:11:24 No shit! I heard back in 1984 that peak oil would be 2000. Then in 1997 it would be 2015... make up your minds please!
1559 2018-03-06 21:11:16 Oil - heads up for the inventory data due around the bottom of the hour The private survey of stocks of oil will be released to subscribers to the firm at 4.30pm NY time (2030 GMT) and will hit media in the minutes following

1561 2018-03-06 21:11:12 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a pain in the ass. I am so caned.
1562 2018-03-06 21:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: spicy crust with chunky motor oil and meat lovers.
1563 2018-03-06 21:11:00 Nope.  Time for export tax on oil gas and electricity.
1564 2018-03-06 21:10:40 Products like Nutella are made with palm oil!! That’s one to boycott!!
1565 2018-03-06 21:10:36 I’ve tried oil cleansing for a year now, I don’t think it likes me
1566 2018-03-06 21:10:30 Real without Modric, Bale and Kroos leads away at PSG.

This says a lot about having a squad made of oil money vs squad of experience and prestige.
1567 2018-03-06 21:10:30 1). *sigh* since you're so desperate: Trump has now layed out plans for a stronger military, industry, and economy. Ha thats working real well for Russia isn't it smart one? US is now on track to TOP Russia's oil production by 2023, Trumps real good for Russia huh?
1568 2018-03-06 21:10:22 What a load of Oil Mob CAPP spin. Your central premise  $43M/day assumes poor quality high cost WCS bitumen sells at the same price as high quality low cost WTI crude. Never gonna happen.

1570 2018-03-06 21:10:15 Oh, that’s not what I had. Mine was a tiny “OO” gauge, 12v dc one. It came with special oil to make smoke. Think it was Triang-Hornby. It was 50 years ago!
1571 2018-03-06 21:10:15 Going to sit on my hands with my big board positions until $DXY makes a makes a decisive move. Still Short REITs , Short oil small size, looking to add more (average $63.80). Holding on Long NatGas until we get a major move or till I reach my floor on a slow climb up.
1572 2018-03-06 21:10:12 Just like an oil filter on your car, Your furnace needs a new filter every now and then; scheduling a quick reminder for yourself to check your furnace filter monthly is a great way to ensure that air is flowing freely through your furnace, and that your filter is doing it's job.

1574 2018-03-06 21:10:03 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1575 2018-03-06 21:09:59 I am a huge fan of the possibilities of Exo's & bit fan of @EKSO @ReWalk_Robotics excited how they not only give health benefits of mobility to the wounded or invalid sentient beings but improve worker efficiency in oil & construction industries, auto manufacturing
1576 2018-03-06 21:09:46 Our community understands the horrors of living next to oil & gas operations, so we voted for @RomanMcAllen for Railroad Commissioner of Texas. There's still time left to vote! #ElectionDay #BlueWave2018
1577 2018-03-06 21:09:32 There is no right or left policy, there is good policy and bad policy. I believe in a mixed economy based the german model, Of course with labour squandering all our oil money/giving it to another country to squander that is now much harder
1578 2018-03-06 21:09:28 What did we do before we discovered coconut oil?
1579 2018-03-06 21:09:13 High school with the foreign girls was a blast and a time of my life I'll never forget the memories we all shared with you and all the others the pieces just fit the best with my queen and I with her by my side. Oil she reigns supreme over power she Denys difficultly we want.
1580 2018-03-06 21:09:04 Samantha is a wanna-be sleuth she was burning the midnight oil delving into private computer records of US citizens, without one iota of cause except to help her hero Hillary who she thought was POTUS in waiting
1581 2018-03-06 21:09:00 Ahh I'll try some peppermint oil, thank you!
1582 2018-03-06 21:08:43 UPDATE 9-Oil prices edge up on weak dollar ahead of U.S. inventory data #energy #oil
1583 2018-03-06 21:08:41 only Barcelona ever made a 5-0 deficit comeback...P$G is not a team, they play mickey mouse teams in a barney league. They are done, Oil money can't buy UCL trophies.
1584 2018-03-06 21:08:41 Make sure that they are always up. As long was they are moving, they are eating. My dad used to put a timer in his coop to wake them up. You can also put an oil in their feed to fatten them up.

1589 2018-03-06 21:08:14 My mostly used oil ones are in my brushmate, but can't throw old ones till they bold  so much memories off them  peaceful hours 
1590 2018-03-06 21:08:08 I was also interested in the excluding private labels. I almost always just buy the store brand for something like canola oil.
1591 2018-03-06 21:08:06 look at you lot with your oil money thinking your all that it makes a change from the many times you had to do it for us when you weren't fighting relegation that was

1596 2018-03-06 21:07:35 NRCC and GOP have been buying elections for decades. Citizen’s United sold out America to the Oil, Banking, billionaire crowd.
1597 2018-03-06 21:07:28 I hope there is neither oil nor minerals there for exploitation and that this splendid place remains unmolested.
1598 2018-03-06 21:07:27 Man I gotta get on it, I just been taking liquid biotin that’s it but how often do you use the oil ?
1599 2018-03-06 21:07:16 The women were mostly illegal immigrants, or homeless teens.  They were being taken to the oil fields of North Dakota to service the men in a modern day Deadwood kind of situation.
1600 2018-03-06 21:07:08 Update your iTunes before you go on holiday mate! Where are we going? Need to know what I've gotta pack and what factor suntan oil to buy!
1601 2018-03-06 21:07:04 Thanks to public pressure, we have saved over 10,000 acres of yellowstone from fracking and oil drilling. A win against the trump anti environment agenda.  Keep it up, he is a putz and we can beat his ass.
1602 2018-03-06 21:06:54 In pre-Israel years,Churchill urged the anti-Zionist Saudi king  to ease Arab hostility to the Jewish immigrants entering Palestine. UK had subsidised the Saudi monarchy before its discovery of oil and thus exacted concessions from the Saudi king to create the Jewish homeland
1603 2018-03-06 21:06:50 So who’s selling full gram oil cartridge hmu
1604 2018-03-06 21:06:48 Psg lol. 
Fucking oil wankers.
1605 2018-03-06 21:06:45 Scotland was running surpluses up to 15% of GDP throughout the 1980s while UK was running deficits. The oil revenue (cash, not debt) was funding rUK's deficits. At the same time Scotland's manufacturing base was being destroyed. An oil fund would've protected that money forever.
1606 2018-03-06 21:06:42 I agree with ya! This was quite off, especially when I read he was supposed to spout off the negative effects of the pipeline and how the oil sands are dirty.
1607 2018-03-06 21:06:39 anyone wanna come get my oil changed with me lol i don’t wanna go by myself
1608 2018-03-06 21:06:37 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
1609 2018-03-06 21:06:36 Donald J Trump is one of the best Presidents we have ever had. Crime going down. Economy going up. And we're going to be the biggest oil producer in the world by 2023. #MAGA
1610 2018-03-06 21:06:36 Ever do something then instantly regret it.... just put Olive oil in my ears
1611 2018-03-06 21:06:23 They actually are doing a bad job moving frac sand and oil as well. We are not looking to put one commodity against the other but both CP and CN need to do better on all fronts.
1612 2018-03-06 21:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1613 2018-03-06 21:06:07 Like handsome oil and water
1614 2018-03-06 21:05:59 Get those votes any way you can I guess.  It's pretty incredible to see what's happening.  Then again, I'm from Canada, so our PM is a walking yo-yo.

"Oil Rigs". 


1618 2018-03-06 21:05:40 Some irony in Oil McBurnie on-loan from Swansea doing what Tammy Abraham did last season in the Championship, while Abraham is on-loan at Swansea
1619 2018-03-06 21:05:40 How do the oil companies feel about your threat to stop shipping their product to market?
1620 2018-03-06 21:05:37 Oil Andy
1621 2018-03-06 21:05:31 In summary:-
A: If oil companies invest in new discoveries and new projects production will rise.
B/ If oil companies don’t invest then existing fields will eventually run dry.

How can that possibly be a  news story?
1622 2018-03-06 21:05:29 It's for smoking weed (oil)
1623 2018-03-06 21:05:22 I pity the person who tries to fry in olive oil and ends up setting the kitchen on fire. And yes, that example is just a freebie for the FTC's market definition. Though I'm curious about the whole excluding private label oils situation.
1624 2018-03-06 21:05:07 All with 1/10th of  ‘s oil reserves. The only foreign market we have() is going to disappear. Where there’s a will there’s a way. Time for  to be part of the solution.
1625 2018-03-06 21:05:07 Because the US is becoming energy independent. They are our competition more now than our customers. Port shipments from Canada would eliminate there chances to broker our oil and gas
1626 2018-03-06 21:04:59 I have to go get an oil change when I get off then we can go
1627 2018-03-06 21:04:57 You know nothing about my beef levels, I pride myself on my diet of burgers, both home cooked and from the finest bowling alley pub, I can assure you they use a superior quality meat than your frostbitten snake oil patties
1628 2018-03-06 21:04:54 Coconut oil
1629 2018-03-06 21:04:44 I just learned it's legal to stick one's finger into the adversary's asshole in wrestling. It's called oil checking. I'm totally terrified.
1630 2018-03-06 21:04:42 It's a 2001. Hour meter just rolled over too. Bought it used from a frac company so km's might be true. Lots of idle time on oil leases. I only put about 350km/day on it short hauling crude oil.
1631 2018-03-06 21:04:38 Dove said OPEC and US Shale are in the “same boat” trying to meet world’s increase in oil demand in the coming years and that the Permian is “the basin to do it” #CERAWeek #OOTT
1632 2018-03-06 21:04:31 Because if you have a really bad year with a bottom feeding team like the Oilers, you have absolutely zero chance of resurrecting your career. Right, Devan Dubnyk?
1633 2018-03-06 21:04:22 I say, let her drink vegie oil and get back to us in 10 years time!
1634 2018-03-06 21:04:15 'Oil boys'. Wow you are so original, wanna be friends?
1635 2018-03-06 21:04:01 I would think he would be very interested in a divorce, and maybe a restraining order for good measure 
1636 2018-03-06 21:04:00 Glad PSG are out. Can’t be having these fake, oil state, nouveau-riche clubs having too much their own way.
1637 2018-03-06 21:03:59 on a side note, does anyone else wake up with a hella greasy face after a nap? like i sleep forty minutes and wake up looking like i dunked my face in oil lol anyone else/anyone know why?
1638 2018-03-06 21:03:40 Oil can buy you players but not a team that can win CL. Was true for ManCity, increasingly true for PSG
1639 2018-03-06 21:03:23 I hate when I have to make appointments to do adult things like getting an oil change 
1640 2018-03-06 21:03:19 I've been putting a face oil on before going to sleep and it is making my skin glow wowowow loving this
1641 2018-03-06 21:03:17 You're just a team with loads of oil money
1642 2018-03-06 21:03:13 Well people have the wool pulled over their eyes and vote like sheep to the slaughter. The ridiculous notion that these private school boys and their friends are fit to be employed by us to run the country is the best snake oil scam sold to the public
1643 2018-03-06 21:03:07 so are you saying we all should feast on oil cause of how efficient and space saving it is?
1644 2018-03-06 21:03:05 Oil money can't buy you trophies
1645 2018-03-06 21:03:03 ladies, amidst all the partying and suntanning, let’s not forget what spring break is really about: going to trader joe’s without a bra (nipples fully visible) to buy some jojoba oil
1646 2018-03-06 21:02:54 everyone around me is getting the stomach flu and I’m just like CH CH CH CHHHHH CHILLLLLLLLL. I take black seed oil! 
1647 2018-03-06 21:02:49 The Earthlayers have "Strata's", Naturally formed Layers and networks of "Veins" of what has "come before" - Layers of Sediment, Erosion... there are Layers and veins of Water and Oil and Natural gasses below our surfaces.
1648 2018-03-06 21:02:47 Not all BC oil Bob. Pretty much everything from Ft Nelson goes to Rainbow Lake or Zama   I have a friend that was called a liar about the pipeline you are tall about lol. And she is anti oil towards Terrace. Kudos to her ,such a good researcher.
1649 2018-03-06 21:02:46 Yea and the oil companies don't want to invest. A little honesty from both sides would be nice.
1650 2018-03-06 21:02:40 also I don’t know how much it necessarily helps with acne but I’ve been using rose hip seed oil and hyaluronic acid 2% from The Ordinary every night and it’s made my skin sooo soft

1655 2018-03-06 21:02:31 Well then, in that case, don’t forget to drink anointing oil before you sleep xxx
1656 2018-03-06 21:02:29 Farmers have "felt the pinch" every since...railways will cry weather, equip breakdowns etc but it boils down to $$$. If cp/cn made more $$ to haul wheat than oil/potash they would haul it. Until then its just groundhog day.

1667 2018-03-06 21:01:33 interesting question.  in past dollar thought to impact non-oil balance, and non-oil balance hasn't changed much 

interesting tho b/c oil supply in us is price responsive, and part of the response to a weaker dollar should be higher US oil production (e.g. supply more elastic)
1668 2018-03-06 21:01:32 Most #DAPL oil spills have gone unreported 2 environmental agencies.If putting environment & people at risk need complete monitoring system which so far hasn’t happened.

1681 2018-03-06 21:00:18 land lock fossil fuels in Alberta needs to get out to the coast so that the whole Canada benefits from increased tax revenues. US about to become largest producer of oil, why no environmentalists not stopping them or China or Russia, etc?
1682 2018-03-06 21:00:11 Canada has the third largest oil reserves of any country in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
1683 2018-03-06 21:00:09 Every time socialism fails it's someone else's fault.
The Venezuelan government keeps raising the minimum wage, speeding up hyperinflation... but it's the US' fault.
The Venezuelan oil industry is falling apart because Maduro replaces experts with cronies... also the US' fault.
1684 2018-03-06 21:00:03 expropriations of fertile lands, expropriations of factories, more unemployed, less production, oil is not eaten, if you do not produce you do not eat.
1685 2018-03-06 21:00:00 Well before oil, they were stealing land and giving it away to white people, but I see the point

1692 2018-03-06 20:59:26 Since I’m traveling for work, I had to do my own progesterone in oil injection for the first time today. I jammed it in, freaked out, and then dispensed. Super shaky, but I did it. #IHateNeedles #IVF

1697 2018-03-06 20:59:08 The smell of White musk oil on my mum when she gave me a cuddle  #ScentMemories
1698 2018-03-06 20:59:08 It looks like grass. You steam it and put lemon juice or olive oil on it. It’s rather tasty.
1699 2018-03-06 20:59:07 What happens when oil's no longer a bargaining chip?
1700 2018-03-06 20:58:55 I would feel bad for PSG, but they tried to buy the #ChampionsLeague with oil money. No sympathy for that
1701 2018-03-06 20:58:54 There’s oil and gas off the south east of England Linda. Just not a lot of it. You do keep that revenue.
1702 2018-03-06 20:58:51 'if you're a husband, having guns in your home makes me question how much you care about your wife, period.' see how stupid this can get @owillis
1703 2018-03-06 20:58:47 Ronald look look oil

1710 2018-03-06 20:58:26 Somebody in montana paid him off, gave him more than the oil companies would give. Follow the money.
1711 2018-03-06 20:58:25 i gotta stock up on all the essentials like incense and coconut oil before this whopper of a snow storm hits tomorrow!
1712 2018-03-06 20:58:23 I need my glasses for this one!!
1713 2018-03-06 20:58:21 Oil money can't buy pedigree! #PSGRMA
1714 2018-03-06 20:58:16 btw, with non oil balance a smaller problem nowadays isnt't it easier to adjust CA with USD corrections? (need less usd correction)
1715 2018-03-06 20:58:15 Im being an adult and getting my oil changed
1716 2018-03-06 20:58:14 Trump derided steel transshipment from China. Oil companies love it. They can make money. Trump neglects to admit that he would do it.  And sweden, look at sweden!. Says he was borne out to say the refugee situation was out of control. "Swedes are fabulous people." TV host
1717 2018-03-06 20:58:13 Yesssssss fuck the filthy oil teams. Viva la resistance.
1718 2018-03-06 20:58:12 @davidpball: @keithbaldrey may or may not agree w @FairQuestions thesis that Amerk oil agents are impeding @TransMtn and other pipelines but I do, judging from acts and fruits, but they're also enjoined willingly by greens, FNs, altlefts etc - but reality is project has $ merit
1719 2018-03-06 20:58:01 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
1720 2018-03-06 20:57:59 Mine loves coconut oil.  They are strange creatures indeed 
1721 2018-03-06 20:57:57 Busy day at work: check, oil changed: check, time to babysit. Long day but feeling accomplished!
1722 2018-03-06 20:57:49 Fuck I'm supposed to work at 4 and I got here at 245 to get an oil change and I still don't have my car..
1723 2018-03-06 20:57:48 Ororo no be crude oil.!!
1724 2018-03-06 20:57:38 coconut oil  >
1725 2018-03-06 20:57:28 We look on the bright side . Plenty new customers trying us out at a discounted price. Hopefully new regulars who maybe wouldn’t have come in if not stuck at home midweek with only the weird unidentified remnants left at bottom of the freezer to eat.
1726 2018-03-06 20:57:24 Oil Dollars don't buy everything
1727 2018-03-06 20:57:23 Any better smell in the kitchen than onions & garlic in olive oil simmering on stove?? Reminds me of growing up, Mom always started there and made magic  Trying my hand at Brisket today wish me luck!
1728 2018-03-06 20:57:18 Get better bro... Oregano oil is the fix!! Taste nasty but you be up in no time!
1729 2018-03-06 20:57:17 Oh poor @OrrinHatch .  Trumpy was so good to you when he shrank the size of Bears Ears National Park to get the oil but I guess this is just a bridge too far, huh?  Man you totally destroyed your reputation with the . #ETTD
1730 2018-03-06 20:57:12 Facial oil BEFORE serum, or after??  #beauty #beautytips #somuchstuff
1731 2018-03-06 20:57:08 Oil companies profits need to go to where they drill just like Alaska. We the people need to be blessed from the profits because OIL is drilling in our state. At least give money for enduring infrastructure!
1732 2018-03-06 20:57:01 Of course we can all get along – the oil lobby paid for this nice community meeting as a forum for ideas.
1733 2018-03-06 20:56:59 Lol. That's it. These frauds are out. Celtic with oil money.
1734 2018-03-06 20:56:57 Move over @great_oil It’s all about me  #ihavethateffect #indiehour
1735 2018-03-06 20:56:56 Polluted water, unclean air, oil spills, chemical on our food??? Regulations to protect us from big business autrocities   all for $$$$.
1736 2018-03-06 20:56:53 Game over...PSG can fuck off with their oil money
1737 2018-03-06 20:56:50 I know you're just trying to protect your phony baloney job, but to suggest that solar research should be stopped (that's what you're saying) is a pretty lame attempt at trying to protect your phony baloney industry.  Oil's first use was in asphalt. Should we have stopped there?
1738 2018-03-06 20:56:47 Accurate data, yes. Aren't you aware that NNPC denied Femi Falana access to information of oil imports and export for 2017, giving the excuse that the corporation isn't included in the FOI Act?
1739 2018-03-06 20:56:44 Oil money is done. #PSGRMA #UCL
1740 2018-03-06 20:56:44 There is a world commodities market, you cannot just up your price because you’re the second largest producer. What is happening to oil is different because there’s a cartel involved and they manipulate supply to get the price they want.
1741 2018-03-06 20:56:43 Oil & gas companies have been listed on trade exchanges since  years. Meaning, they are exclusively market & technology driven.
1742 2018-03-06 20:56:41 Thought you were going to say "we are guardians of the galaxy" 
1743 2018-03-06 20:56:38 Ronaldo GOAT ....
1744 2018-03-06 20:56:31 And where does Volvo fit in this mix? Note that mile for mile, electricity costs ~1/3rd what gasoline costs. Makes the electric SUV look attractive especially if you're worried oil prices are going to spike at some point in not too distant future
1745 2018-03-06 20:56:16 Sea urchin is the new truffle oil. That’s right. I said it!
1746 2018-03-06 20:56:02 Haha opening up the wrong spice can be lethal! They sell fresh fried snacks the same way there minus the plastic so it’s straight out of the oil onto the inky newspaper. So not safe but so good.
1747 2018-03-06 20:55:51 Brought Grace to get an oil change and find out I gotta get a lot of other shit done to her 
1748 2018-03-06 20:55:45 Tell that to the oil and gas companies who needed subsidies to get to where they are today. Don’t kid yourself, they’ve pocketed billions in subsidies.
1749 2018-03-06 20:55:19 Get a grip mate. In 25-30 years, when the dirty Russian and oil money has dried up, City and Chelsea will be back to scrapping to stay in the league
1750 2018-03-06 20:54:54 I stopped for a long ass time. Hopped back on recently. It's just the convenience thing. They come in clutch a lot of times. But it's bud>oil all day and day, and 3 times on Friday. #yafeelme
1751 2018-03-06 20:54:49 No oil there buddy, you didn’t get the memo? 
1752 2018-03-06 20:54:31 In 1950's we used to manufacture ocean going ships, jet aircraft, cars and trucks. Now we close down oil refineries, steelworks, no cars, no trucks, no jets, aluminium smelters are closed. We are the 13th largest economy on the planet. But it's impossible to do stuff. Say's who?
1753 2018-03-06 20:54:26 New fav chip flavor
Rosemary n olive oil
1754 2018-03-06 20:54:22 @crystalchappell I hope you're feeling better. A friend who runs a daycare takes oil of oregano.  It helps her. I don't like the taste . I'd get some empty caplets from a pharmacy to put it in first. Lol. Or mix it in something. Possibly a oil based salad salad dressing.
1755 2018-03-06 20:54:20 I just recently moved out of Maryland. Baltimore is a hole.
1756 2018-03-06 20:54:15 This Argan Oil Shampoo>>>>
1757 2018-03-06 20:54:08 Because he was hand picked by Putin, who also promised a cut on the gas/oil deal when sanctions are lifted?
1758 2018-03-06 20:53:41 Our COO Mark Little is speaking as part of the North American Oil: The supply disrupter panel at #CERAWeek
1759 2018-03-06 20:53:36 @cspan  nice! I'd paint an oil portrait of you all for free! If I could point well.
1760 2018-03-06 20:53:34 It is clear that we will be the world's largest producer of oil in a few short years. No thanks to you.
1761 2018-03-06 20:53:20 If you have lavender or chamomile essential oil (therapeutic grade), rub a drop or two on the bottom of each foot at bedtime. You will sleep peacefully.
1762 2018-03-06 20:53:16 Trump has passed a law saying its ok to poison Americans-who much money is he paid by big oil and gas? A CROOK is ruining the WH
1763 2018-03-06 20:53:16 My great grandmother for some reason loves to put oil in her bath water, her maid couldn't get her out today and seriously considered calling an ambulance... im horrified at the thought of my coworkers having to come out here and wrestle her out of the tub like a greased pig 
1764 2018-03-06 20:53:05 First time eating at checkers oil
1765 2018-03-06 20:53:03 LoL 

Is that mean't to be some kind of counter argument?

All countries that have economies based upon supplying oil are suffering at the moment, except those that have the biggest wealth in reserve.

We're living in a time of both military and economic warfare.
1766 2018-03-06 20:53:01 Seems you're the dimwitted one.. City didnt get the oil money back in the 80's. They got it in the last 10 years when we dominated, so you'd be still sitting behind us.. Lol dumbass
1767 2018-03-06 20:52:57 @billmckibben Do you know of the "Transitions Handbook:   from oil dependency to local resilience" by Bob Hopkins?
1768 2018-03-06 20:52:55 I didn't realize until I started explaining to a coworker, that some people aren't aware of why you have to use vegetable or canola oil for frying, & olive oil is not a good substitute (beside expense). This might be the 1st foodie or at least cook's case.
1769 2018-03-06 20:52:52 How about some candles? Maybe steel and flint to light the oil lamps?  Hey I'm just following you to the Stone Age, lead on!
1770 2018-03-06 20:52:49 I forgot to tell yall this morning ..

So BOOM you wanna know how tired I was this morning ?

I sprayed the febreeze in my hair instead of my olive oil hair spray 

Mind you I got braids. So it’s sticking
1771 2018-03-06 20:52:47 Way back in HS, I tried to turn moms 78 Tbird into the General Lee on a little hill, lost oil pressure, destroyed the cam..lifters..pushrods.
I was by myself though.

1773 2018-03-06 20:52:29 But made a lot of  in the process. Doesn’t at least one of the current MPs have interests in Iraqi & was it Kurdistan oil? Follow the money you find the REAL terrorists.
1774 2018-03-06 20:52:26 Non-oil developing countries yet again in #oil producers’ firing line.
1775 2018-03-06 20:52:18 But then there wouldn't be any oil!

1777 2018-03-06 20:52:04 As if anyone should use what he questions as a standard by which to parent. “Omg, I can’t do that. Owiis will question my skills” said no mom ever.
1778 2018-03-06 20:52:01 Yup, he wants sanctions lifted so Russia Exxon can drill for oil in the Arctic - bet he gets lots of   if he pulls that off, probably WH and his merry band of thieves will too
1779 2018-03-06 20:51:59 Thirty years of snake Oil from McConnell. He’s trying to give Trumpov cover for a potential tariff fiasco.

1781 2018-03-06 20:51:30 Today ima go to Walmart and get oil
1782 2018-03-06 20:51:26 The things I was recommended today by the Kiehl’s lady were for men so I doubt you’ll have used them but she also recommended midnight recovery oil concentrate and some alternatives to the men’s specific ones so just tryna decide between them. Which ones do you vouch for?
1783 2018-03-06 20:51:26 Why strangely for Yaran? #Rosneft is known to be in talks with Persia Oil and Gas for a long time. Could even be the first oil IPC...
1784 2018-03-06 20:51:22 Dan Sullivan & Rob Bishop say they are saving the Arctic by drilling it. How they saving the Arctic & #ANWR? From it’s being pristine, from a refuge, it’s wildlife, the caribou, Native Alaskans who live & hunt there? Or from oil spills, climate change, environmental destruction?
1785 2018-03-06 20:51:09 House unanimously votes to eliminate federal funding for oil paintings of members of Congress and other federal employees.
1786 2018-03-06 20:51:09 @itsSophieBelle my mums roast potato instructions she gave me (and works every time) are: Oil for potatoes - 10 mins to warm

1787 2018-03-06 20:50:58 Most painful shower of my life compared to when I was a kid and we sprayed oil on to get tan..nice and cold brrr
1788 2018-03-06 20:50:50 Surely @Torres had worse chat but more oil ?

1792 2018-03-06 20:50:15 Need to stop calling them earthquakes.  Earthquakes are a natural phenomenon.  These are the direct result of pumping too much oil water back into the ground
1793 2018-03-06 20:50:13 Isn't it just dirt/ oil?
1794 2018-03-06 20:50:04 think interesting thing about recent q4 trade deficit widening is that it hasn't come in respond to an obvious surge in demand for US assets from the rest of the world.  that surge came in 14, but it basically substituted for official funding (w-o any CA widening thanks to oil)
1795 2018-03-06 20:49:54 It’s cream cheese whipped with Parmesan and olive oil
1796 2018-03-06 20:49:54 Meanwhile my boss Putin is showing an animation of nukes raining down on Fl. I have nothing to say about this because I knew it was a personal message to me from my comrade warning me to get those sanctions lifted so we can start making money on our oil company Trump stated.
1797 2018-03-06 20:49:52 almost time for a oil change
1798 2018-03-06 20:49:51 Okay this oil shit gotta stop.
1799 2018-03-06 20:49:50 Great points @jamiealangleave, also for your second point - keep an eye on the competition, so you are aware of the market, ensure your "Brand" is carried through everything you communicate, from a tweet to a shop front #indiehour
1800 2018-03-06 20:49:38 See i miss having my monte Carlos. I knew how to change the headlights, windshield wipers, check the oil, change the tire and etc. I’m grateful for my new car but I don’t know how to do shit but change the tire. 
1801 2018-03-06 20:49:34 Please keep this baby and his habitat from being covered in oil.

1805 2018-03-06 20:49:05 It's such a weird attack line. There's lots of folk in BC that can't drive much anyways if they live in Vancouver, or, choose not to drive anyways because they're kind of hippy-ish. Getting less oil or giving Hogan more opportunity to delay is a positive to them.

1810 2018-03-06 20:48:44 Honestly all I really want in life is an essential oil mega kit.
1811 2018-03-06 20:48:41 I used vitamin E oil a couple years ago on a wicked scar I had on my leg and it made it smaller and lightened it up.
1812 2018-03-06 20:48:40 Use Hemp Oil As A Cure.

1814 2018-03-06 20:48:27 I'm told there is a similarity when slow riding them to manoeuvring a oil tanker, ? I've only ever ridden an ex police RT 1200  in the uk or a GSA very briefly in the Czech Republic so can comment on the KT
1815 2018-03-06 20:48:22 Jamie oliver is a silverspoon fed little upstart living in LA LA land where everyone has cupboards stocked with oregano and olive oil and nobody ever has to scramble about in the change tin so they can buy a pot noodle.utter utter cunt.
1816 2018-03-06 20:48:15 If you own a Ford Taurus fuck you and your oil changes.
1817 2018-03-06 20:48:06 So in exchange for Trump turning their pristine lands over to oil companies, the Powers-that-Be are giving him a highway. Sounds like a lose-lose situation for everybody except Trump and his wealthy, oily friends.

1824 2018-03-06 20:47:39 Totally not true. I own two battery powered cars. I care very much about the environment. I've planted trees in Israel. I built a house that is extremely energy efficient. It's stupid we can't sell our biggest asset at a fair price.  Notwithstanding, I'm bearish long term on oil.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1837 2018-03-06 20:46:36 Just made a smoothie with frozen strawberries, frozen blueberries, a banana, green superfoods, protein powder, honey, olive oil, and coconut oil. I forgot the ground flaxseed this morning
1838 2018-03-06 20:46:30 i have super dry skin and ponds is a rly good moisturizer for me, mixing it w a few drops of bio oil will also help fade scars
1839 2018-03-06 20:46:28 Any good car service shop / mechanic  for Suzuki? Don't trust 3s dealership for oil change and other things??? Isb / Rwp only?

1841 2018-03-06 20:46:09 I use Shea moisture Jamaican castor oil shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner. I use aphogee 2 step protein treatment once a month and I use a mixture of a Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, jobaba oil, and tea tree oil for my scalp
1842 2018-03-06 20:46:05 my life changed the second antoni said coconut oil gets rid of the smell of garlic off your hands
1843 2018-03-06 20:46:00 Good idea to create some additional revenue in the tourism industry.  With Electric vehicles being the future, Dubai is paving the way to survive without oil money.
1844 2018-03-06 20:46:00 GP Then you just rub oil on it to get the sticky stuff off it. Or is that how the sticky stuff gets on there? Or is it both? 

Science is confusing.
1845 2018-03-06 20:45:58 And we’ve done it without oil money and without ruining the game like PSG,CITY,MADRID
1846 2018-03-06 20:45:56 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1847 2018-03-06 20:45:37 There's one thing I really don't miss from pre recession days and that's people around me insisting on cooking everything with olive oil. Totally selfish, I just don't like it.
1848 2018-03-06 20:45:35 Husky refines BC oil in PG. Lines exist to get to lower mainland. Alliance pipe takes liquids rich gas to US Midwest, however offshore export of propane. butane and other liquids has started and will add value/markets to NEBC gas.

1850 2018-03-06 20:45:27 Bondi Sands 1 hour express or TanOrganic self tanning oil!!! TanOrganic fades away lovely so u don’t look like a patchy mess (n it smells of lemons)
1851 2018-03-06 20:45:12 Yeah. That’s why countries like Japan, Denmark and Switzerland, with no oil to sell at any price, are so poor. Those evil Saudis!
1852 2018-03-06 20:44:59 A few tips for retailers from experiences we have had (and from observing others):

1 - Hire an accountant that actually understands VAT + your business.
2 - Focus on what you're good at, and do it better than everyone else.
3 - Internet isn't the be all and end all.

Try and take an oil platform 2 years into production from Exxon and you will be in court for decades.
1854 2018-03-06 20:44:49 Because there is an $8 trillion dollar Exxon oil deal stalled due to US sanctions on Russia  .......

Even if this is high we need to take real costs, like shale oil in mind when determining energy use.

1869 2018-03-06 20:43:14 The leftist media bias is clear here. Oil is evil therefore, must be priced beyond affordability. But, unfair trade practices that put the United States at a disadvantage MUST BE MAINTAINED? SERIOUSLY, leftists? How f**king stupid do you think voters are, Bloomberg?

1883 2018-03-06 20:41:45 For this I stand with u. The oil gurus always determine the price so why cant we and Ivory Coast  also determine it.
1884 2018-03-06 20:41:45 FYI other industries exist like oil and gas if only you had 1/2 the passion for our biggest most money making ventures!

1895 2018-03-06 20:40:37 Bill Nye is correct,  if only politicians  were brave enough to apply subsidies for oil and gas to alternates,  it’s easy to protect the status quo, much tougher to embrace new, it’s hard work.

1901 2018-03-06 20:40:04 setting that aside, the relationship between the dollar and the non-oil balance looks quite different than the relationship between the dollar and the oil balance.  non-oil balance widened after dollar strengthened in 14

1975 2018-03-06 20:31:25 when ur face is oily af but u don't have oil blotting sheets :-(
1976 2018-03-06 20:31:23 I must stop the NDPs job killing policies on the free market by taking direct control of the market and crippling it by dictating who they are allowed tosell oil to.  Conservative freedom fighters assemble.
1977 2018-03-06 20:31:23 @MavisTire what's a reasonable time to have to wait for an oil change to be done? My appt was at noon and still waiting 
1978 2018-03-06 20:31:06 Anyway, good idea for climate reporters to attend CERAweek. There are still quite a few oil reporters who’d benefit from attending some climate conferences..

1981 2018-03-06 20:30:44 Thank you for fighting for the banks and the oil industry!  Little guys like them need all the help they can!
Can't wait for "entitlement reform"!  So many people will be freed from having to make rent and utility payments as they forage the purple mountains majesty.

1983 2018-03-06 20:30:41 Alaskans own 43,356 shares of PINE CLIFF ENERGY LTD, worth $26,658. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
1984 2018-03-06 20:30:32 Likely this idea will be patented by the major car companies and buried. Oil keeps the world going around and nothing will disrupt that #9News

1987 2018-03-06 20:30:21 Yeah both same company. Before I started using Aqua I used Joncryl primer undercoat then oil on top if the job had to be done in the day. I've not used the Leyland equivalent
1988 2018-03-06 20:30:21 Or maybe Russia is a kleptocracy whose economy consists of oil, natural gas, and sports bribery.
1989 2018-03-06 20:30:18 Man y'all making lettuce outta OIL?!?!?
1990 2018-03-06 20:30:18 Production costs were cut on a small number of fields. Why did John Swinney and the SNP ask the UK government to reduce North Sea oil taxes? Because they thought they are making huge profits? That's laughable.
1991 2018-03-06 20:30:16 it's okay to let go of conceptuality
1992 2018-03-06 20:30:13 You don’t get half price because there is no access to Tidewater. You get half price because it’s only half oil. It’s called DILBIT which means it’s diluted bitumen.
1993 2018-03-06 20:30:07 it's important to learn how to let go of conceptuality
1994 2018-03-06 20:29:51 Could be. I was going literal with the retweet from Drudge on oil. Thought they might be demonstrating coordination with media. Hannity posted BOOM too. We'll see...
1995 2018-03-06 20:29:33 There bitch yo hair looks dry you need to put some oil on it why you ain’t get none while you was at the hair store 
1996 2018-03-06 20:29:27 Anyone wanna take my car to tquah for an oil change for me? No? Ok.
1997 2018-03-06 20:29:26 Ha ha - excellent idea! Mine will be 'Ale Fat If Lo' and then, 'Flea Fat Oil'. 
1998 2018-03-06 20:29:21 I think @LindaFrum's bill is silly. As of now, foreign money doesn't 'buy' Canada through the electoral system. It buys Canada by acquiring resource and oil and gas companies, and other corporations.
1999 2018-03-06 20:29:17 psg is my favourite oil money team
2000 2018-03-06 20:29:16 I’m going to try the oil out with this, is amazon the best place to order?
2001 2018-03-06 20:29:02 Good format, good tip!   My 3rd vehicle is a Dodge truck and I turned its oil to sludge .. not good.

2006 2018-03-06 20:28:18 I also like the simplicity of a wheel gun. If it doesn't go bang just pull the trigger again.
2007 2018-03-06 20:28:12 I Thought the pens was for the cannibus oil. It’s something different?
2008 2018-03-06 20:28:07 I do that when I oil paint - gets me in a zone!
2009 2018-03-06 20:28:06 And if that isn’t bad enough it takes two barrels of your oil to make one barrel for shipping. So in essence you’re only getting 1/4 of your value by shipping. Build a refinery and get it all.
2010 2018-03-06 20:28:05 The resolution is not to revise anything in any novel.. The moral of the story forms the resolution. Eventually the notes will run out and we see what trump does. Besides oil in syria in the hands of the russians raising gas prices to seem like the villiangte.
2011 2018-03-06 20:28:01 @TrigeminalNerv. I was diagnosed with this problem this morning. I have had chronic pain associated with degenerative joint disease for years, and Oxycodin relieves the pain, but this pain in my face is fierce. Cannabis oil works but it is illegal, any suggestions.

2016 2018-03-06 20:27:28 is the middle east running out of Oil? We will never be the lead in oil unless the middle east runs out. DON'T RUIN THE ENVIRONMENT for a tank of gas Donald.
2017 2018-03-06 20:27:26 Who are we kidding here, do people actually think that in todays day and age of division we are going to get the whole planet together and actually prevent a green house gas runaway. Dig the damn oil, apologize to your kids, wish them luck and lets bury our heads in the sand!
2018 2018-03-06 20:27:24 Gotta get an oil change Thursday 
2019 2018-03-06 20:27:18 Guess what! You won’t get one friggin penny more for your tar oil from China than you do from the US. It has been diluted with benzene & naptha which has to be removed again before they can refine it. In short, a barrel of oil is only half oil so you only get half price.
2020 2018-03-06 20:27:16 Getting an oil change by myself for the first time...and yes I just turned 32. But why they gotta ask so many questions, like just change the oil please. #adulting

2022 2018-03-06 20:27:08 It's interesting that almost each of the recent years that we have Ceraweek in town we had some negative #API and #EIA reports. Maybe, it might be the week we start seeing the builds in Cushing after a while. Leaning towards a bearish inventory report this week #oott #oil

2024 2018-03-06 20:27:02 No idea. Could look at oil as a byproduct of feed. I do know that Soya use is dropping in UK dairy. Two high yield dairy diets here: 1 has 450g/day soya (the only human-edible protein), the other has 1kg. Those diets create ~1.2kg/day milk protein + beef. Pretty good deal to me.

2027 2018-03-06 20:26:36 @Lucas_Oil I tried your Synthetic Oil Stabilizer.  Immediate drop in fuel economy by 2mpg after the oil change on my commute.  I guess your product *really* is just an oil thickener.  Drained it out and refilled, back to normal mpg.  #NeverAgain

2033 2018-03-06 20:26:18 Hey @Acosta ...if you get the chance, try to ask Trump about the SoS story and how the Kremlin rejected Romney and exactly how Tillerson came into the picture. 
It appears that Big Oil and the Russians chose the SoS.

2057 2018-03-06 20:22:51 We aren't taking care of this planet. Why should we be allowed to ruin another one. Besides there's no oil there. Or grocery stores. Or animals. I couldn't live without dogs and horses.
2058 2018-03-06 20:22:51 @TireDiscounters Why do you prioritize phone calls over walk-in customers?  It's infuriating to be mid-conversation about something as simple as an oil change, only to have the phone ring 2 or 3 times and you just stand there while they are now helped.

2093 2018-03-06 20:19:59 Still no borehole engineer. Also no boiler engineer (forgotten). This is all getting a bit ‘dreckly’... 
And we’ve run out of heating oil, for which problem we have no one to blame but ourselves.

2101 2018-03-06 20:19:01 I'll be happy when Alberta says that they are willing to provide the money for any clean-ups.  Alberta can then try to claim the money from the oil companies.  
Or even better - Open some refineries in Alberta and ship finished products; create some jobs.

2104 2018-03-06 20:18:47 it guess it (and i don't really know for sure) would falls into the same bracket as bioethanol and biodesiel they both require a huge amount of fossil fuels to produce and are questionable if they actually provide a positive carbon footprint compared to oil.
2105 2018-03-06 20:18:36 Great more oil polluting our world.....thats great!
2106 2018-03-06 20:18:31 Norway costs per barrel of oil production are HALF the cost of the Scottish sector costs. Norway also has eye watering tax rates compared to here. The two situations aren't comparable.
2107 2018-03-06 20:18:07 Oil change
2108 2018-03-06 20:17:59 I blatantly sniff my man. Especially when he's wearing 'Eau de Tractor Oil'...
2109 2018-03-06 20:17:49 So do big banks, pharma, Insurance, oil, billionaires, & Russia.
2110 2018-03-06 20:17:47 definitely need this castor oil 
2111 2018-03-06 20:17:38 Venezuela is a result of corporate meddling. Big Oil wants their resources & is destabilizing them. I’m speaking of having services like the Nordic countries. You know, the countries that kick our asses in health, education & happiness.
2112 2018-03-06 20:17:24 Was thinking Zinsser then oil undercoat and oil gloss
2113 2018-03-06 20:17:23 2.5 hours later, still waiting on my car.  Must be a fantastic oil change and new tire! @McCluskeyChevy come on man...
2114 2018-03-06 20:17:13 It really does depend on what you’re making. You can cook almost anything with water. I haven’t used oil in anything from curries to burgers for the family in YEARS. Anything that specifically needs to be fried, you can bake in the over with water for the same effect.
2115 2018-03-06 20:16:59 Close the National Monuments by day. Drill for oil, strip mining and polluting at night. We need to stop this BS.
2116 2018-03-06 20:16:56 Sometimes it's just a matter of oil and water.  You won't mix with everybody and when you don't..... be OK with that.
2117 2018-03-06 20:16:50 Shouldn't be hard to find. Are you for sure wanting to get one locally? You can usually save a bunch of you buy online, and really most of the cheap scooters run forever as long as you take care of them. Stuff like changing oil is real easy on them too!
2118 2018-03-06 20:16:44 Please calm down, we are talking of pre 2015 when Crude oil was sold between $65-$140, a $78 cost of production is not far fetch, mind you it's a Joint Venture.
2119 2018-03-06 20:16:21 This looks amazing? You’re a natural with oil paints looks too good
2120 2018-03-06 20:16:19 I read this yesterday. “After Brexit there will be huge opportunities for Britain as a result of Vision 2030,” he said, in reference to a national plan in which Saudi Arabia aims to diversify their economy away from oil dependence. /
2121 2018-03-06 20:16:07 Lol thanks to that Wild growth oil
2122 2018-03-06 20:16:05 Great news to our rural communities . Let's do more....grain silos and oil banks
2123 2018-03-06 20:16:04 Every morning, Zlatan Ibrahimovic gets up and splashes boiling oil in his face to wake him up.
2124 2018-03-06 20:15:49 Simple. It was an oil grab, from the least popular kid at the table. 

Notice, we don't want anything from North Korea, so we don't go in. War is a childish way to resolve issues/obtain property, when the adults have left the room. Rarely idealism is the real goal of the campaign
2125 2018-03-06 20:15:49 Not big on greens, but serve it with a pack of fags and smother it in old fryer oil?!! It's going on!
2126 2018-03-06 20:15:43 vegan korean artichoke with goat cheese. . .22

2128 2018-03-06 20:15:30 Baked potato chips are a lie.  They're internally fried. 
Dehydrated potato mixed with oil then baked. It's just a different way of frying.
2129 2018-03-06 20:15:30 I like to imagine that it’s not a gif, and that Jack Donaghy is kind of like Elijah but with alcohol instead of flour and oil.
2130 2018-03-06 20:15:12 Abysmal as he may be,
at least Trump never killed 1,000,000 people
so he could steal a nation's oil. 
#BushTheLesser #GeorgeWBush
2131 2018-03-06 20:15:07 I have my macadamia nuts (best keto snack, but expensive), almond milk, sesame oil/seeds, coconut oil... lol... I have kitty litter on its way right now.
2132 2018-03-06 20:15:04 Maybe take a pay cut and stop supporting offshore oil drilling so we have money to renovate towers 
2133 2018-03-06 20:15:02 Lithium mining is terrible, but the element is 100% recyclable. We're getting better at that. Solar is also becoming cheaper than oil. This combination means that while EV cars still impact the environment, it's less than half what a gas car does, and dropping.
2134 2018-03-06 20:14:47 They will all be working at universities
2135 2018-03-06 20:14:43 Bro I will send photo of London oil bottle
2136 2018-03-06 20:14:41 I’ll spend 50 dollars on pods and fortnite but when my car needs an oil change I consider whether it’s really worth it
2137 2018-03-06 20:14:38 With the economic situation yo-yo-ing I think it's now mainly down to the pursuit of profit.  At one time (might still be the case) Far eastern steel was a no-no in the oil and gas sector due to bad casting and forgings despite (no not Brexit!!) certification.
2138 2018-03-06 20:14:29 Oil spillage I believe. Home team players are stuck, maybe literally!
2139 2018-03-06 20:14:25 better question who tf drinking oil
2140 2018-03-06 20:14:22 I use them for hair and skin. You can also put aloe and honey in your drinks. I wouldn’t advise you drink tea tree oil tho 
2141 2018-03-06 20:14:14 Make pasta, heat olive oil + chopped garlic in a smaller pan, add steamed broccoli to it, then toss together :9
2142 2018-03-06 20:14:10 earlier i got small oil burns on the webs of my fingers so thats how my day is going
2143 2018-03-06 20:14:00 You mean a leadership that starts to overthrow each government which is in the way, a leadership that starts illegal wars, killing millions of people, because of oil,... A leadership that only works for olichargs? A leadership like the US-government? Aaaahh, now I understand.
2144 2018-03-06 20:13:59 Think it will succeed but when is the million dollar question
2145 2018-03-06 20:13:53 Every time a chemist has left over men products (beard oil, men shampoo, shaving cream, etc.) they tell me “take the leftovers to your boyfriend” I LAUGH EVERY TIME
2146 2018-03-06 20:13:51 In this case, the revenues of the oil sales would be high enough to justify production of oil even if the associated gas had a negative value.
Although associated gas may essentially be free at the well-head, there are still costs from its gathering, processing and transportation
2147 2018-03-06 20:13:42 אני מפנה אתכם לקרוא את ההסבר הנמצא בתחתית הגרף ושם אותו גם כאן:

IEA: "Negative well-head breakeven costs for the Eagle Ford and Permian plays are due to natural gas typically being a by-product of oil production in these plays.
2148 2018-03-06 20:13:41 Oh, I get it - I’m already in hell, nice comeback pastor - and it’s *your*.

PS You’re a sycophant-snake-oil-salesman who uses religion for profit and to mask your immorality. 

PSS wanna borrow $563,000 lol
2149 2018-03-06 20:13:34 I'm getting my oil changed and if it's more than they charged me for a truck I'm setting fire to this place.
2150 2018-03-06 20:13:32 every time I've drifted close to the edge, or even off the deep end, I find the way back always has something to do with acknowledging how I am, what I am, what I'm doing, etc.
2151 2018-03-06 20:13:27 Oil is obsolete

Go Solar
2152 2018-03-06 20:13:10 No need to wait, there are plenty half-assing it as professors.
2153 2018-03-06 20:13:07 I firmly believe in UKOG

2159 2018-03-06 20:12:40 Yeah cause you always want to honour those evangelical snake oil salesman who fleece their sheep for millions. Can’t have enough of those guys!
2160 2018-03-06 20:12:38 Worst thing is I did a dummy sell and got offered 9.75
Should’ve pressed sell but hey oh
2161 2018-03-06 20:12:36 I don’t know about nice, I’m pretty sure a couple of oil rigs were on fire
2162 2018-03-06 20:12:20 WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTS:
The U.S. is likely to overtake Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2023, accounting for most of the global growth in petroleum supplies, a top industry monitor said Monday.

2163 2018-03-06 20:12:19 Oh you would love our antique stores. I recall one on the Midwest with a room dedicated to oil lamps.
2164 2018-03-06 20:12:19 Ooh my god u and church guy hahaha its oil and water sorry
2165 2018-03-06 20:12:12 May God help you if you need gas right now. It looks like the 1970s oil shortage at pretty much every @Wawa, in anticipation of tomorrow’s storm.
2166 2018-03-06 20:12:11 Yup, google protects them now but in 15 years that google search will be damming for employment.
2167 2018-03-06 20:12:03 Destroying life saving regulations for the benefit of the oil companies is not helping America. We need implementation of sanctions on Russia for interfering in our elections, nothing else matters if we can no longer select our own representatives. Why are you so hesitant?
2168 2018-03-06 20:12:01 PSG wasting precious Oil money.
2169 2018-03-06 20:11:51 OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo: supply is good but demand is even more robust
 Will hit 100M bpd of demand faster than many forecasters thought
OPEC and shale oil producers should work together, not in silos
2170 2018-03-06 20:11:49 Have to feel sorry for Macclesfield there, travelled all the way down and game is off cause Maidstone players couldn’t get in due to an oil spill on the M25. The fucking conference.
2171 2018-03-06 20:11:40 Then the radiator pop down, engine nuh change oil since it buy, 200k + km on it
2172 2018-03-06 20:11:29 Just heat works fine! No oil required.
2173 2018-03-06 20:11:08 President Trump is the only President to get the little fat dictator to the table without promising nuclear reactors, money and/or oil. as Bill Clinton did.
2174 2018-03-06 20:11:07 oil can actually really beneficial for oily skin, because damaged skin can use the free fatty acids in oil to repair a compromised lipid barrier so less water evaporates out the gaps and the skin stays hydrated - excess oil is produced to make up for a damaged barrier/dehydration
2175 2018-03-06 20:11:03 good idea!!! that’s funny bc i used to put on lavender oil almost everyday and i ran out about a month ago...you may have solved the mystery here 
2176 2018-03-06 20:11:00 The only way that you can have oil is for the olive to be crushed. 
#TuesdayThoughts
2177 2018-03-06 20:10:53 oil only produces gas for cars... I am a retarded liberal, and plan to vote for Hillary again , even if she does not run.
2178 2018-03-06 20:10:52 Just incase you want something to level up your mornin here’s my avocado toast “recipe” :
Half avocado
Splash of lemon juice
Tsp of olive oil
Red pepper flakes
Pinch of salt 
              ENJOY
2179 2018-03-06 20:10:40 lmaoo y'all remember that Chopped episode where none of them knew what to do with the plantain and one of them legit took the plantain, peeled it, cut it and two and put it in a pan with NO oil
2180 2018-03-06 20:10:37 It was Johnstones Aqua undercoat. That's a suitable u/c for w/b or oil top coat.
2181 2018-03-06 20:10:31 This lemon and dill tuna in olive oil is pretty good.
2182 2018-03-06 20:10:21 You do know there is something called alternative clean energy that much of the world is already using. We will always need oil but not as much if clean energy is pursued.  The earth & populace health would be better off & jobs in those industries would increase.
2183 2018-03-06 20:10:21 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
2184 2018-03-06 20:10:19 They'll just be like Bernie and run for office.
2185 2018-03-06 20:10:15 Shrimp boats dragging booms against a sea of oil, while US Merchant Marine stood idle at the ready with tankers, and Dutch standing by with recovery mechanisms ready to be flown in.
I'll never forget 0's incompetence.
2186 2018-03-06 20:10:14 The FG is not interested in doing that. Regulating will cost the oil firms money, and they don't want that. The FG can even be said to be run by the oil firms.

2188 2018-03-06 20:09:57 End of oil boom and complete dollarization with neither fiscal nor monetary means of stimulus in Ecuador. But Jan IMF forecast was for positive growth this year.
2189 2018-03-06 20:09:44 Now, in addition to the magnetic bracelets we carry, we have essential oil beed bracelets.
2190 2018-03-06 20:09:37 oh man, definitely the multiple times i've burned myself splashing hot oil on my bare stomach because i wasn't wearing a shirt or apron
2191 2018-03-06 20:09:00 I trust NOK about as far as I can throw a barrel of high priced oil.
2192 2018-03-06 20:08:52 There is definitely a need for a #RetailBuddy, eight of our local independents met last week and we briefly continued the discussion from last weeks #indiehour and just cross-referencing information was enlightening!
2193 2018-03-06 20:08:48 It's going to be an expensive day, with an oil change and renewing my car tabs, but at least I can walk to the dept of licensing 
2194 2018-03-06 20:08:29 President Trump is the only President to get the little fat dictator to the table without promising nuclear reactors as Bill Clinton or money and/or oil.
2195 2018-03-06 20:08:22 Why is Trump mocking the works of the American film industry - one of our most important exports. Why doesn't he mock steel and aluminum or oil?
2196 2018-03-06 20:08:22 All in hopes they get their votes? To show they have compassion for these criminals? Where is the logic here?
2197 2018-03-06 20:08:01 If steel and aluminum present national security issues for the US (as stated by POTUS), then where is our Strategic Steel & Aluminum Reserve located, like we have for crude oil?
2198 2018-03-06 20:07:58 Benzema wan start rubbish
2199 2018-03-06 20:07:56 But why would they “sneak in”? Europeans don’t need visas to come over just their passports!! This makes no sense...
2200 2018-03-06 20:07:50 Hi, yes, it me, Man Who Lives In Oil Company Territory With Future Teacher Strike.

We have a 30% teacher turnover rate because we pay the worst salary in the US. Or close to it.
2201 2018-03-06 20:07:50 @Vote4Life2016 I notice a Young Living oil on your Twitter Page. I use the oils , so very good! Following you!
2202 2018-03-06 20:07:46 So whenever I gave up palm oil I thought it was going to be so hard, but it turned out to be easy. Just a little extra label reading. What things with palm oil are you looking to replace?
2203 2018-03-06 20:07:46 I feel like I just paid 1000$ for an oil change n new windshield wipers. I dnt see no diff. where ur wrk at?
2204 2018-03-06 20:07:39 maybe it's a good idea..on that day..
 everybody exchanges little bottles of Snake Oil
2205 2018-03-06 20:07:33 The corrupt infrastructure plan is a front for more deregulation of protected lands to sell for oil drilling #MAGA  NOT
2206 2018-03-06 20:07:32 Tell us more (again) #retailbuddy #indiehour
2207 2018-03-06 20:07:20 So we all want to drop plastic straws eh? So are they less efficient re time/ energy & trees than plastic to produce & of course 60% are coated with wax made from oil.
The issue is to recycle them..lets not jump in until someone has done an impact study.
2208 2018-03-06 20:07:20 President Trump is the only President to get the little fat dictator to the table without promising nuclear reactors as Bill Clinton or money and/or oil.

2210 2018-03-06 20:07:08 Showing up to class with tanning oil still on me has been one of my greater achievements thus far
2211 2018-03-06 20:07:00 Based on @Saatah thread,I feel like writing a story about how in the future after the oil and gas has been used up,the environment still left as it is,no way to grow crops or fish,air too polluted to breathe,most middle class moves out leaving only the poor
2212 2018-03-06 20:06:45 President Trump is the only President to get the little fat dictator to the table without promising nuclear reactors as Bill Clinton or money and/or oil. That didn't work so well!!!
2213 2018-03-06 20:06:41 @TwitchyTeam Read your article on Obama and "..can't drill out way out of oil..". You're right. I was in oil and gas for almost 30 years. Enough to last for over 1000 years. New wells drilled in US since restrictions lifted adding to pharmaceuticals, tons of products made in US.
2214 2018-03-06 20:06:38 Usually I do nothing and just let my skin do it’s thing but I used grape seed oil and it’s helping because it was literally itchy and burning. Sometimes, oddly enough, if I go to the tanning bed it will go away as well.
2215 2018-03-06 20:06:32 Been here for 2 hours waiting on this oil change, finna do it myself
2216 2018-03-06 20:06:31 Do we need Russian oil so bad we'd fuck the rest of the world over?
2217 2018-03-06 20:06:29 I’m getting an oil change for my sister at her boyfriends job and his friend who I’ve met before keeps tryna shoot his shot and he keep missing 
2218 2018-03-06 20:06:20 I think I'm getting pretty good at cooking grilled steak and fries. The trick I never knew was resting it while it's still not quite done. Then after 5 mins resting it is! Grill with lots of black pepper and some garlic oil:9
2219 2018-03-06 20:06:06 Hot image! Definitely got my motor going!
2220 2018-03-06 20:05:59 PSG leaking oil

2222 2018-03-06 20:05:47 and the wrap is made out of new process transforming oil into petrochemicals... trying to find new markets in wrapping chocolate boxes!   
2223 2018-03-06 20:05:46 THAT may be wonderful but as a result the oil companies will raise the price of gas! THEY GET RICHER while we the Amer people get POORER.  Mr. Pres, put a stop to all of this & impose PRICE CEILINGS.
2224 2018-03-06 20:05:43 My skin would probably be as dry and crumbly as the sand in the Sahara if it wasn't for coconut oil and lush
2225 2018-03-06 20:05:42 No one wants the snake oil salesmen despite what he & his agent say ......
2226 2018-03-06 20:05:34 Wtfffff your dad forgot to put the oil cap back on 
2227 2018-03-06 20:05:21 A small country, of only 5 million people, that has been spewing out copious amounts of oil, worth hundreds of billions, for over 40 years needs subsidised? 

Think about that for a minute Linda. 

Who else have you been subsidising Kuwait, Saudi Arabia? 
2228 2018-03-06 20:05:20 I’ve been working in the oil industry for years and believe me, there are no industry experts in Paris
2229 2018-03-06 20:05:05 Him, Benson and Yamamoto for 40 games next year would be good. Problem is for sure the Oil need Yamamoto with the big club
2230 2018-03-06 20:05:02 A ribeye w some buttery ass mashed potatoes w truffle oil & some red wine would be nice AF for dinner tonight
2231 2018-03-06 20:04:59 ooh fancy, i guess but id presume a lot of oil on already oily skin wouldnt end nicely
2232 2018-03-06 20:04:58 My Moms food contains so much oil that even America wants to invade it. #KurdishProbs
2233 2018-03-06 20:04:57 You sound just like an Albertan trying to use our "social license" to get our oil through you green lunatic province.
#cdnpoli #bcpoli #abpol #ableg
2234 2018-03-06 20:04:56 Really, this is an issue in a province with Oil Companies ripping off consumers, BC Hydro rate increases, ICBC out of control.  Seems like the government is focused on the wrong issues.
2235 2018-03-06 20:04:54 Finally got it to connect and im excited. Castor oil and tea tree oil my savior
2236 2018-03-06 20:04:51 Even just  HEMP.  It would benefit this country more than most people even know! But the big oil and big pharma are lobbying tooth and nail to keep hemp illegal to grow.  Considering we've been growing and using it for thousands of years with ZERO problems
2237 2018-03-06 20:04:42 It’s the only reason @realDonaldTrump hired him. Did anyone really ever really think someone who works for trump has a moral compass? That’s like mixing oil and water. It doesn’t work. No one in Trumps circle isn’t corrupt and bought
2238 2018-03-06 20:04:40 Well Liz the oil in your lamp is running so low, you could not find your arse in a sunlit room using both hands. You still can't see the #OneObviousSolution to Brexit stood right in front of you. You are the weakest link - goodbye.
2239 2018-03-06 20:04:28 $GOOGL Google Cloud’s CEO Diane Greene is talking about how she moved from oil and gas, where she wasn’t allowed to go on the platforms she was designing bc she is a woman, into computing #CERAWeek
2240 2018-03-06 20:04:26 Crispy light fluffy roast potatos! She always uses olive oil to cook them in, it’s her secret
2241 2018-03-06 20:04:24 People who think curly wash & go's are low maintenance/easy are the same people who brush dry hair & think serum & oil are the same thing
2242 2018-03-06 20:04:19 I went w my grandma to the dealership so she could get a oil change and we’ve now been sitting here for 2 fucking hours
2243 2018-03-06 20:04:16 your the one making a big deal out of it not me, I am mature enough to know that oil prices fluctuate, you clearly are not...
2244 2018-03-06 20:04:04 Would that be before or after your cronies drill for oil on public lands?
2245 2018-03-06 20:04:00 Does black Jamaican castor oil give your hair body or length? Or both?
2246 2018-03-06 20:03:53 Trying the castrol oil thing tonight
2247 2018-03-06 20:03:48 I mean it is, it's Centella Asiatica extract. But oil isn't necessarily bad for oily skin.
2248 2018-03-06 20:03:48 Man, ain't that the truth. And I should just keep some oil and vinegar in my desk so these bagged salads stop ruining my lunch.
2249 2018-03-06 20:03:39 Fortunately I am not losing money. Got in at 1p took my money out around 3p and only wish I’d sold rest at 10p
2250 2018-03-06 20:03:31 *Looks for hat in a panic*                  Bridge: “I need my fucking hat it looks like someone just dumped a straight bucket of oil on my head”  story of my life @briidgeeee
2251 2018-03-06 20:03:26 From Syria to Rohingya to Nigeria, Somalia, trump and so on 
2252 2018-03-06 20:03:24 Your head has oil....
2253 2018-03-06 20:03:03 Yes...some things can be done, & reduce the impairment. I've had a very severe depression the last 2 y., and my brain fog has partly disappear: medication,omega-3 acids (pills,sesame and linaza seeds or oil), some vitamins I lacked D, B6, B12,...DM me if u need more info

2255 2018-03-06 20:02:51 the healing oil treatment changed my hair massively!
2256 2018-03-06 20:02:50 All that said.. I think hemp/cannabis oil falls into a narrow category of "probably efficacious sometimes, when properly prescribed". So, useless when directed for "cancer", but maybe undeserving of the same scorn as "alkaline diets"?
2257 2018-03-06 20:02:40 Burning the late night oil tonight 3 major conferences in the final planning stages all aimed at increasing women’s participation not only at home but far and wide.
2258 2018-03-06 20:02:36 People should know that Scotland has far more wealth than just oil
2259 2018-03-06 20:02:34 Cuticle oil is a must!!!! Unless you want nasty  looking finger nails.
2260 2018-03-06 20:02:33 So I leave the shampoo and the coconut oil for 3 hours? Do I put the oil first or shampoo?

2262 2018-03-06 20:02:31 It is a little strange normally the oil requires huge amounts of plants so he's probably just an employee of a larger operation.
2263 2018-03-06 20:02:17 My Facebook account was reported for porno because I posted about saving the environment and my stand against big oil pipelines.
2264 2018-03-06 20:02:14 Interesting thing about the energy business: Only three women are scheduled to speak on the main stage the first two days of the #CERAWeek conference and only one works in oil and gas.
2265 2018-03-06 20:01:56 This is what greedy, self-centered, idiot oil drinking morons who think they own our government does! The ones that have done this, once General Flynn is proven to innocent, they should reimburse every penny to the General then go to jail for whatever they can be charged 4. #SAd
2266 2018-03-06 20:01:55 I went to Superdrug and this and the baking oil all weren't even sold!
2267 2018-03-06 20:01:50 Guys I have an oil stain on my HS Live in Auckland top and I don't know what to do 
2268 2018-03-06 20:01:38 Oil prices up three sessions in a row
2269 2018-03-06 20:01:23 I'm the meantime oil consumption isn't going away. The biggest contributor to Canada's deficit? Oil imports. It's like a Shepard going bankrupt buying other people's wool.  You're too kind calling them maroons. They're charlatans taking advantage of the willfully naive.

2274 2018-03-06 20:00:33 added jojoba oil to my skin care routine and my skin is so soft. Literally crying in the club rn
2275 2018-03-06 20:00:32 I can even remember when I first realized that Clinton was a vile piece of shit snake oil salesman.
2276 2018-03-06 20:00:30 Daily Closing Oil Price Update: 65.74 #oil #opec #oilprice #brent
2277 2018-03-06 20:00:28 I really wish I could x_x almost every time I've tried it I have a severe panic attack. I've been looking into CBD oil in general for my anxiety and other issues tho
2278 2018-03-06 20:00:22 I’ll try to hide my surprise. I guess he’d rather commit our young men and women to serve in the Middle East to protect oil at market prices. And when is the Commonwealth using exclusively mass transit?
2279 2018-03-06 20:00:22 Olive oil oil?????
2280 2018-03-06 20:00:21 Arctic Oil is catnip to fat cat Putin.
2281 2018-03-06 20:00:20 I swear, I could say I broke my leg and someone would try suggesting coconut oil as a treatment. #nothingcanbethatgood #putsomewindexonit #isthatreferenceoutdated
2282 2018-03-06 20:00:16 Dem don fight me Taya.... Me no even send Dem... Na their Ogas no get mind tweet with their real handles
2283 2018-03-06 20:00:15 LCR is a really good gun for the price. The 9mm version is a good choice too. Little more power than the 38 and more controllable than the 357.
I have a 22, 9mm, and a 357 LCR.
2284 2018-03-06 20:00:11 Tip #2 THROW AWAY YOUR SHAVING CREAM! Use coconut butter or oil to shave. Apply oil after you dry off. No stubble. No burn. IT'S SOME GOOD SHIT!
2285 2018-03-06 20:00:10 It's funny how homesickness never goes away. Could be the new cinnamon oil I got that reminds me of my Mom who loves Hot Tamales. Or the fact that I missed my Grandpa's 93rd birthday party. Maybe that I got a call his brother died & I can't be there.

It's hard to be far.
2286 2018-03-06 20:00:09 I've eaten real crickets, lightly sauteed in oil at the Montréal Biodôme. But, sure, in a shake sounds good, too. ;)
2287 2018-03-06 20:00:07 Made some gluten free coconut oil brownies. MAN. They are my new go to recipe!
2288 2018-03-06 20:00:05 As to American energy let's tariff solar panels but rape our national parks! Keep the oil executives rich while we destroy our children's future. Good plan!
2289 2018-03-06 20:00:05 There’s an oil for that!!

Campari tomato, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil and olive oil
2292 2018-03-06 19:59:43 Sheet mask, headspace, essential oil diffuser 
2293 2018-03-06 19:59:41 Really, this is an issue when you have Oil Companies ripping off BC Consumers everyday, ICBC out of control, BC Hydro rate increases, BC ferries frozen rates, but Fuel surcharges going up.
2294 2018-03-06 19:59:41 Today’s been a good day!! Woke up ON TIME (could’ve been earlier but I made it), got a RAISE, bonus on Friday, sis took my car for an oil change, other sis+mom ordered a  for my bday Thurs & I was lucky enough 2 have them change it 2 white  instead of choc! Yesss!!!!!!!!!
2295 2018-03-06 19:59:34 Keep it healthy, trim the dead bits, don’t over wash: try oil training. Then it’ll start to lean towards a lewk. Go there with shape and dimension, but keep it versatile
2296 2018-03-06 19:59:33 My daughter got a unionized job in CDN Airlines then Air Canada after takeover right after HS. 
10 years later got a  job w commision in a small biz where most of clients in CGY oil patch. 
HUGE swing. Went from a SJW liberal to a six-figure, rabid conservative.
2297 2018-03-06 19:59:19 Don’t need oil man just good vibes 
2298 2018-03-06 19:59:17 Awesome
2299 2018-03-06 19:59:17 We tried to warn them that would happen what did they think was going to happen what are you pay the robot nothing per hour a little bit of oil
2300 2018-03-06 19:59:10 Carry on your person.  Not in a purse would be my suggestion.  Sig P938 might be a good one for you.  they are comfortable to carry on your body (you have positive control of your weapon all the time).
2301 2018-03-06 19:58:50 The Herald wants all oil revenue to go to Westminster to buy stupid useless weapns of Mass desctruction, aircraft carriers without aircraft and to stuff the pockets of mega rich Tories who need more while people starve to death, good old @heraldscotland
2302 2018-03-06 19:58:45 Oreos do come in Vanilla. They are probably stuffed with palm oil which is really BAD for the rain forest and all who live there. become a label reader - it could save your life & the world.
2303 2018-03-06 19:58:35 Oh interesting!  you don't pop yours in oil? All the "recipes" I saw had a preheat oil step, mostly like you used for the peanut oil (though, no smoke for me).
2304 2018-03-06 19:58:27 Watch the sucking up of Saudi Crown Prince Salman hit overdrive tomorrow complete with faux indignation of human rights abuses and war in Yemen. The only thing that matters will be oil and trade and arming SA with more UK weapons to continue atrocities in Yemen
2305 2018-03-06 19:58:23 Many far more important issues globally than the price of Canadian oil, Larry. You use "our children" to argue for more fiscal responsibility, yet you don't seem to care what kind of environment they grow up in.
2306 2018-03-06 19:58:21 getting a new windshield, a new phone, a new inspection sticker, got an oil change. omg.
2307 2018-03-06 19:58:21 Oil, tires, gas lmfao everything 
2308 2018-03-06 19:58:16 BC oil reserves are shipped to Alberta as well our condensate. All natural gas is processed before it hits a sales line and shipped  @AJWVictoriaBC would argue that B.C. wouldn’t hit emmisions targets if we refined our raw exports
2309 2018-03-06 19:58:16 I never use peanut oil, son has a sensitivity to peanuts. Use goose fat for roast potatoes though.
2310 2018-03-06 19:58:11 Prohibit hydraulic fracturing, economically harms the owners of oil tight sands. While the prohibition lasts, it benefits OPEC producers , since the price will not  decrease everything that is possible by high production . What is the price of an ambitious  lawmaker man ?
2311 2018-03-06 19:58:04 I found oil strips of the ones I use on the floor, i was so tempted to pick them up. But I’m not that cheap 
2312 2018-03-06 19:57:47 I tried to be a good person and buy the new tesco peanut butter as it doesn't have palm oil in it but I just tried some as its so gross
2313 2018-03-06 19:57:07 ra mantag oil og water oy incompatible hays
2314 2018-03-06 19:57:04 its just like oil and ritz crumbs that somehow got turned into like a weird peanut butter-esque substance, but usually theres just a little residue on there, that was like, it was like a sandwich cookie of that ritz gunk
2315 2018-03-06 19:57:03 The best fat for fries is duck fat. 

(* Peanut oil is also an acceptable answer, allergy restrictions permitting.)
2316 2018-03-06 19:56:56 "If macho dudes toiling on oil rigs can become more vulnerable and open and tenderly expressive, so can you."
2317 2018-03-06 19:56:50 Tea tree oil
2318 2018-03-06 19:56:48 If it’s irritated you might have gotten it caught on a pillow or blanket while sleeping just throw on some tea tree oil!
2319 2018-03-06 19:56:37 I put some peppermint oil under my nose to help clear up my sinuses, but now my eyes are sooooo watery. SOS
2320 2018-03-06 19:56:11 It's just the global market demand which is already insanely inefficent 

We could easily reduce single use plastics and other wasteful ways to use our "precious" oil but the world really isn't taking this seriously it shows

Politics is for control and regulation not ignorance
2321 2018-03-06 19:56:08 You can keep the people... Just give me the oil! The annointing makes the difference in your life!
2322 2018-03-06 19:55:51 I've heard they make around $12/hr but that's before gas, tires, oil changes, depreciation on the car, etc...
2323 2018-03-06 19:55:49 Robert Dudley, Group Chief Executive, BP  talks about the oil & gas climate initiative (OGCI) 10 companies around the world that produce 20% of global production, they will reduce methane emissions, work on CCS and invest in emissions reduction tech  #CERAWeek
2324 2018-03-06 19:55:46 not like an actual store bought deep conditioner but mixing olive oil, vitamin e oil and honey is amazingggggggg
2325 2018-03-06 19:55:43 Yes
N they havnt even scratched the oil and gas here in Oklahoma yet. Especially in these mountains and along red river.
2326 2018-03-06 19:55:42 The ford house charged 75 to change my oil, why am I surprised 
2327 2018-03-06 19:55:40 First good old Boris, who is next Andy Nigel Farage? Nigel at least travels to the USA to support Trump. Brexit finest snake oil salesmen! Sold it all on lies then ran away when it got voted for! May should have kicked Boris to the curb.
2328 2018-03-06 19:55:27 That will be your oil sump not your exhaust
2329 2018-03-06 19:55:25 In the passed that's what I've done... w/b u/c primer and oil top coats... just think Zinsser adds that bit more adhesion... but not sure if that nullifies the need for the u/c now or whether a 3 coat system is best or one coat too many...
2330 2018-03-06 19:55:24 Let's pray for higher oil prizes then!

2333 2018-03-06 19:54:45 Just deep fried my credit card in peanut oil instead of canola oil, hoping it might slim-down the monthly payment.
2334 2018-03-06 19:54:42 Maheen this is talent. You're so good. I oil paint, but don't have practice of human forms. Only recently started sketching and painting forms. Need practice. Mine are abstract, landscape, and flowers etc.
2335 2018-03-06 19:54:30 Im good with weed I love to smoke it grow it,  make edibles and cannabis oil/wax. So I love weed
2336 2018-03-06 19:54:26 one if you keep your doors open while it runs! also if you get a diffuser it has all the benefits of a humidifier with added essential oil benefits :) just be careful if u have pets because some aren't good for them
2337 2018-03-06 19:54:23 Well, that is what I could find for now. It seems the oil age is not over yet :(
2338 2018-03-06 19:54:20 Those are potato chips that are cooked in oil so no it’s not just oil
2339 2018-03-06 19:54:18 Eso esta pasando ahora con el petróleo y gas, peor aún ya licitaron el gas/oil Shale, una depredación tremenda en el ecosistema y sin tener beneficios para el BIEN COMÚN. Los beneficios son para unos cuantos políticos...
2340 2018-03-06 19:54:00 Until somebody explained to me that it was MEANT for babies, I thought baby oil was a crude and horrible substance.
2341 2018-03-06 19:53:59 9yo: What do truffles taste like?
Me: Well, I don't think I've ever had them by themselves.  I've had the oil on fries.
9yo: But what are they?
Me: They're kinda like mushrooms.
9yo: IN A COOKIE?

Turns out he was asking about Girl Scout Cookies...Trefoils.

2346 2018-03-06 19:53:34 #DonaldTrump is all like I must protect the oil industry, steel, and dairy farmers. In the future we will drive Telsa's, make everything from plastics, and drink milk produced in a laboratory. If you want to protect the future give #tax cuts to the #crypto industry!
2347 2018-03-06 19:53:29 2/3rds of fossil fuel consumption in the UNITED STATES, alone, is used to support animal agriculture. There's several ways animal agriculture promotes wars. One,  being war for oil.
2348 2018-03-06 19:53:29 Not only the exploitation of people--capitalism exploits the earth we live on, to the max.
Capitalism is a fat leech that feeds on natural resources, like humans and oil.

2351 2018-03-06 19:52:39 Went to marriage counseling, then switched cars with Melle Mel so I could take her car to the dealership to get an oil change. Currently waiting and on Twitter. In theory, I’m “reading my Kindle.” #PerksOfHavingAFianceWithoutAJobInTulsa
2352 2018-03-06 19:52:37 Never seen a cannabis oil factory. What a lot of tosh
2353 2018-03-06 19:52:32 Intercoolers and radiators are really efficient, plus most turbos are water or oil cooled.
Plumbing isn't an issue really.
Issues with power delivery ? If anything it'll be smoother.
2354 2018-03-06 19:52:29 The hair food or oil? The smell though
2355 2018-03-06 19:52:29 Take care of your oil buddies Paul. They wrote you a big check.
2356 2018-03-06 19:52:23 Oil is my sunscreen

2358 2018-03-06 19:52:08 You do understand that a good portion of the American public sees this for the BS propaganda it is, right? We were lied to about Libya, Iraq, Honduras, and now you're lying about Syria. We are illegal invaders in Syria, funding headchoppers who brutalize civilians, all for oil.
2359 2018-03-06 19:52:07 So where did "Big Oil" sign your nice card?
2360 2018-03-06 19:51:56 I put grape seed oil on my face and calmed my eczema down. Happy face. 
2361 2018-03-06 19:51:36 She got me thru a lot that car, tickets, DUI, breathalyzer, almost exploding cause my dad foegot to put the oil cap back on. Plenty of more bullshit lmao
2362 2018-03-06 19:51:35 Yes dr bronners is so good!! Wash ur whole body with the soap and get pure tea tree oil :) 
2363 2018-03-06 19:51:32 We actively trade with a global community, primarily supply natural resources. Today, and for the near future, oil and gas are part of our offering. Sure, world must absolve its dependency on O/G. It's not going to happen overnight or even soon. We're beginning. In the meantime..

2365 2018-03-06 19:51:26 Just for "oil head" and Eric. Over 50 elephants are murdered every day to supply ivory to the fkg Chinese. Instead of sending our troops to fight oil wars we should be helping African nations preserve their natural resources.

2373 2018-03-06 19:51:04 activated cashew nuts blended with fruit of your choice and kept cool, the base is simply just coconut oil, dates, walnuts and vanilla pressed down and cooled, then it’s layered and frozen! proper easy and super nutritious then i just made it look pretty 
2374 2018-03-06 19:51:04 If you’ve got a personal oil refinery somewhere in Oakham it’d be the perfect work van! Beast of a machine...
2375 2018-03-06 19:51:02 @KirkAndCallahan I would pay good ol’ American greenbacks to see @BrittMcHenry and @TomiLahren dressed in star-spangled bikinis wrestling in a tub of domestically manufactured hot oil while Lee Greenwood sings God Bless the USA.
2376 2018-03-06 19:50:58 I tell everybody this, but to keep colds away or get rid of them faster, my wife and I swear by the essential oil "On Guard" by DoTerra.  The beadlets or lozenges are best, as the oil just in water is not a good taste, lol

2383 2018-03-06 19:50:25 omoh this recession is getting worst o. I just saw Chibuzo taking bread wit anointing oil dis evening. Abeg person shld help o
2384 2018-03-06 19:50:11 that's because you're shit and don't rub enough oil on your face
2385 2018-03-06 19:50:00 We are not going to strike North Korea. That would almost certainly mean war with China, and hopefully not even Trump is that foolish.  

Besides, North Korea does not have large demonstrated oil reserves, and THAT is why we start wars with countries that haven't attacked us.
2386 2018-03-06 19:49:41 I love coconut oil that smells & tastes like coconuts.
2387 2018-03-06 19:49:29 Hehehehe... Una pple dey try sha....
2388 2018-03-06 19:49:22 Then reduce the price of oil
2389 2018-03-06 19:49:21 The world needs oil Canada’s got oil. It is not that complicated.
2390 2018-03-06 19:49:18 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
2391 2018-03-06 19:49:15 No questions needed: #oil
It permeates every aspect of our lives. We take Saudi oil, why not a Prince? Closes the circle. #sarcasm
2392 2018-03-06 19:49:10 I just got the dr bonners orange tea tree oil hopefully it works ! Fingers crossed 
2393 2018-03-06 19:49:03 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
2394 2018-03-06 19:49:03 Drill for oil off shore!!!
2395 2018-03-06 19:49:01 I wish there was more going on with carbon neutral fuels. It's frustrating oil companies make it really expensive and impractical. While fuels like that aren't perfect, they're certainly better than constantly pumping out the carbon that's been stored for millions of years.
2396 2018-03-06 19:49:00 Yes, there's no doubt that M7 is a selfless man. He even decided to give part of his oil to Ugandans. Who else on this planet can do that?
2397 2018-03-06 19:48:53 And fish oil!
2398 2018-03-06 19:48:32 Try tea tree oil!!! It really does help with pimples
2399 2018-03-06 19:48:30 I actually tried to go palm oil free before i went vegan. Best way is simply to use whole foods IMO. Biscuits are the most unavoidable, i've checked every singke packet. Only digestive lights are palm oil free and maybe rich tea.

2401 2018-03-06 19:48:25 And of course, the plan for state ownership of oil (as exists in Norway) was dealt a death blow by the Tories, who privatised the British National Oil Corporation shortly after the SNP helped Maggie to get elected in 1979.

2405 2018-03-06 19:48:12 They either don't care, don't understand the issues, or are benefiting personally from oil/gas. Who knows which.
2406 2018-03-06 19:48:10 It's not about any one person. Doesn't take a genius to notice the giant mistakes our leaders have made that led to massive death & chaos. If our government wasn't bribed and owned by oil corporations and bankers, we would have much more benevolent policies. Not rocket science
2407 2018-03-06 19:48:10 Slakt är väl ett opassande ord när man beblandar sig med Lundin oil och deras affärsmetoder...
2408 2018-03-06 19:48:09 Is there any difference?  They're both unabashed, unashamed opportunists and snake oil salesmen.
2409 2018-03-06 19:48:02 It is lovely here. BTW, I tried bending my knees as if to try curling. I think the answer to your question is "cod liver oil"

2412 2018-03-06 19:47:45 Thank you for highlighting the role that sustainable palm oil can play in reducing our impact on tropical #forests and valuable habitat. We'd encourage consumers to play a vital role in protecting 1/2
2413 2018-03-06 19:47:43 All the people saying 'who drinks oil' ...you might aswell if you drown your food in it to cook it. .all it's saying is be aware that cooking with  oil can add on 400 calories...so grill/oven instead of fry
2414 2018-03-06 19:47:34 That's ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. My d-in-l did the core testing for it. There are DECADES of oil left in the North Sea! There's LOADS left and it is recoverable and cheap to do so now. Stop telling LIES.
2415 2018-03-06 19:47:34 It was a BEAUTIFUL OIL PAINTED MASTERPIECE

2420 2018-03-06 19:47:05 Count it joy  honour and privilege that people call you first when they are in need,  If you don't have what they ask, ask God to reveal where it is in your house because you have the oil and God is about  to do something
2421 2018-03-06 19:47:03 He calls them like he sees them?  And I agree. Lets not forget about the half a trillion oil deal they were working on. I'm sure it will resurface at some point. That kind of money really brings out the greediest of people.
2422 2018-03-06 19:47:03 I went to the gym from work I’ll have you know, changed man since you left the oil bizz
2423 2018-03-06 19:46:56 I dont see much talk about US Navy dependence on foreign oil, is shipping in your to-do list at some point? If so i can point u to some cool hydrogen/battery vessels
2424 2018-03-06 19:46:55 Snake Oil Salesman. Con-man. That’s just who he is, was and always will be, through & through. He could have lead ANY party depending on how it benefited HIM but he also picked up the evangelicals. Sealed the deal.

2428 2018-03-06 19:46:31 Interesting to see that raw soy is 20% fat, while soybean meal is ~3%. I.e. the oil industry would have ~77% ‘waste’. I wonder if that’s been put across correctly?

2437 2018-03-06 19:45:45 That's not strictly true, the Venezuelans are hungry because the price of oil has collapsed due to the Saudis over supplying it and driving the price down.
2438 2018-03-06 19:45:37 I oil paint. I have paintings done by me up in my room etc.
2439 2018-03-06 19:45:33 Everyone has mask.."bringing democracy"  this is the biggest cover to steal oil ..and in this democracy milions of muslims  were killed..
2440 2018-03-06 19:45:29 Ridiculous. This a disgraceful. Look at what happening people. EPA is changing the clean water act to help an 19th century industry: COAL! Turning National parks into oil fields. This has got to stop. Speak up America! This Isn’t making us great again.

2445 2018-03-06 19:44:21 In dairy we feed soybean meal - oil already extracted. Even small amounts of soy oil has profound suppressive effects on milk fat - not good. Things may be different when feeding other species.
2446 2018-03-06 19:44:08 Objection noted numerous times. I hear what we shouldn't do but haven't heard what we should do. These tariffs in a tariff free world?
2447 2018-03-06 19:44:06 Thank you for looking out for #sustainable #palmoil when you shop! @coopuk , @LidlUK and @Tesco are all members of RSPO - their own brand products will use certified sustainable palm oil. The WWF Palm Oil Scorecard is a handy tool for checking which 1/2

2476 2018-03-06 19:40:45 so what makes you think that any of this is true? because from our position it seems like histories greatest deception. Convincing people they are sick and only this religion has the cure, very snake oil salesman like.

2482 2018-03-06 19:40:05 Hi RSPO.
Although I support sustainable palm oil and see the benefits, the labelling, (in the UK and US at least) is vague, ill defined and sometimes non existent. 

Until this is sorted, I advocate that consumers avoid palm oil all together.
2483 2018-03-06 19:40:05 Yngwie Malmsteen, but he used pastels, & drew with them wonderfully. But occasionally ate his pastels, too.
Iron Maiden ate their food subjects occasionally, but also drank their oil colours.
2484 2018-03-06 19:39:39 I’m not sure what this says about me, but I almost fell asleep while getting my hair cut, and again while waiting for an oil change. I was supposed to be studying today...
2485 2018-03-06 19:39:26 Venezuela is being strangled by U.S. criminal sanctions & economic sabotage. The Latin American country has the largest oil reserves in the world, and Exxon-CEO-turned-"diplomat" Tillerson wants to get his grubby paws on their black gold, as well as their coltan & other minerals.
2486 2018-03-06 19:39:13 Sometimes I wonder if politicians realize throwing down ultimatums like “I will cut off the flow of oil to your province” just pisses people off and makes them dig in... 
2487 2018-03-06 19:39:09 Keep at it David. Dor will be as huge as any other uk oil company.
2488 2018-03-06 19:39:04 Just get a oil change when I get off today
2489 2018-03-06 19:38:50 Does it say 'Oil'?
2490 2018-03-06 19:38:47 Boris is Britain's joke. They make a fine pair. Maybe Andy is getting lessons from old Boris how to snake snake oil to get your country to self destruct, then walk away?
2491 2018-03-06 19:38:46 Lemon pepper is a really nice thing to add into veggies when you cook them. I usually do some virgin olive oil and lemon pepper on top of asparagus. makes it taste surprisingly good.
I also always recommend cajun seasoning and hot red pepper flakes.
2492 2018-03-06 19:38:45 You equate your stats to fossil fuels and Nuclear.  I believe I was referring to Oil vs. wind power.  Meanwhile, as many as 28,000 birds are killed each year — that's one every two minutes — by the Ivanpah solar plant in the Mojave Desert
2493 2018-03-06 19:38:41 Why can’t we just fund @Tesla and use electric, hydro, or wind energy with their power walls and solar roof tiles and use bloom boxes for commercial energy instead of oil?

2498 2018-03-06 19:38:17 Out of curiosity, what prompted you to share this? Not that I don't appreciate the info, but noticed the timestamp on the article is from Nov.

Also, if oil demand is 25% for cars, 30% trucks, planes, etc., and 20% for petroleum products, what is the remaining 25% used for?
2499 2018-03-06 19:38:09 To speed up hair growth, add a few drops of rosemary oil to your shampoo.
2500 2018-03-06 19:38:06 Delta, United, Virgin, and any other airline doesn’t give two shits about “experimental”. When the tech is ready and profitable, it will exist. Until then, oil is the only option.
2501 2018-03-06 19:37:57 Instigated? That does a vast disservice to the native folks on the rez that did that thing. You think they get much russian propaganda in the reservations? You think that would be a greater motivation than an oil pipeline running over their ancestor's graves and water supply?

2511 2018-03-06 19:36:41 Hi Bella, consumers should also be made aware of the option to choose sustainable palm oil when shopping. Sustainable palm oil helps protect forests, wildlife and safeguards local communities. Consumers can take action and drive real change by letting businesses know that you 1/2

2520 2018-03-06 19:35:43 NOW that Saudi's are not making billions from oil sells to the US, they are trying to convenience US & England to invest in it's country.  BS! US should start investing in itself & England can do what they want.
2521 2018-03-06 19:35:42 Sullivan is an expert on everything.. bump stocks, semi auto rifles, interest rates, yield curve, oil and oil production (both up and down stream of course), tariffs, steel production, international trade.. what a guy!

Also may I suggest that she encourages people to demand deforestation-free, peat-free, exploitation-free Certified Sustainable Palm Oil?

2545 2018-03-06 19:32:22 I still believe Oil investing should not be taking lightly. Spring time & Summer time help promote this seasonal aspect of the move.
2546 2018-03-06 19:32:20 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2547 2018-03-06 19:32:17 Green reasoning is Alberta oil is bad so let’s import it from the US? BC is also in a confederation not a canadian version of the EU.

2550 2018-03-06 19:32:11 It’s far more complex then you suggest. Most soya products used for ruminant feed are byproducts of oil extraction, therefore easy to suggest its ‘solely’ grown for animal feed, when in truth soya is dual purpose in most instances.

2558 2018-03-06 19:31:16 Yes but it also exported the Protocols; aside from the (prerevolutionary) arts, caviar and oil, what positive exports can be called Russian? All their best people and ideas left or were oppressed at home

2560 2018-03-06 19:31:02 Ummm I don’t know if you meant to ask me this question but as long as you’re working with a gram stain, it’s always worth while to try using oil immersion with any magnification 1000x or greater!
2561 2018-03-06 19:31:01 It’s unacceptable you post images of left hand drive London buses. Shame! Are you a true Brexiter or some alien foreign artist trying to flog a cheap oil painting of a London that NEVER EXISTED.

2567 2018-03-06 19:30:07 It is! It will be lots of fun - it's connected to my essential oil business and I have lots of friends going as well, and a formal dinner where I get to wear a pretty dress!

-take every vehicle (car, truck) of the road
-eliminate air travel
-eliminate trains

Or, if you don't like that approach, you could just shut down Alberta. Not just the oil sands, all of Alberta

2657 2018-03-06 19:21:27 I only recently noticed mustard seeds have 25g of protein/ 100g and rapeseed around 20g. Yield on mustard seed only ~1 tonne/ hectare though. Could they be bred to be useful protein source as well as oil?

2661 2018-03-06 19:21:00 Funny how the US is so proud to now be a leading nation in oil. Oil won't matter when climate change catches up to us.
2662 2018-03-06 19:21:00 I’m gonna give cbd a shot to see what it does for me. I have access to thc oil if it doesn’t work but I’d rather try the one first.
2663 2018-03-06 19:20:55 Ezekiel tortillas, cooked with coconut oil, beans, chicken, Spanish rice, avocado, kale, tomato. All ingredients organic and the cooked ingredients were made from scratch. I’ll bet you can have these.

Use the tax money to invest in infrastructure, roads, and most importantly into jobs. 

Medical use, one drop of thc oil prevents a child with seizures from taking 5 to 10 pills.

Will also put more attention to remove heroin from the streets.
2666 2018-03-06 19:20:20 We've managed to ban the evil stuff from our house. I now make most of our own food. Cooking chocolate is palm oil free, Sun Pat peanut butter too. Read the labels and avoid.

2669 2018-03-06 19:20:02 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
2670 2018-03-06 19:19:51 You my friend are an idiot!!
Right now, this very second. Every physical thing that you can see and touch required oil to produce and oil to get it to your simple, ignorant self!

Trump celebrates Oil & Coal.

2676 2018-03-06 19:19:22 I actually don't agree with his decision on this. For one BP paid out 62 billion in compensation for that oil spill. Two the costs of those regulations are about 90 million a year. Seems like BP would be better-served adhering to them.
2677 2018-03-06 19:19:20 You have a much lesser opinion of the public than I, evidently. 

How we transition from oil is a political choice. At some point, we have to collectively take on the industry and transition, or billions die needlessly.

Fuck compromise. It failed.
2678 2018-03-06 19:19:16 there are so many people getting their oil changed, i’m gonna be here forever
2679 2018-03-06 19:19:14 Such a shame, palm oil plantations everywhere, same as the Malaysian peninsula. An amazing country with beautiful wildlife.
2680 2018-03-06 19:19:13 Eventhough there is carbon in hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide does not belong. You need hydrogen and carbon only. What comes to mind when then mention hydrocarbon is oil, and it's derivatives. So in the context carbon burning or emission will work but what do I know. #bbnaija
2681 2018-03-06 19:19:11 Well, I only wish there is a dependable stat on the swipe fall of oil prices took on the economy and the protectionist policy so we actually see the ratios and apportion blames accordingly.

2700 2018-03-06 19:16:52 People I come across still quote dumb shit about the price of oil from 15 years ago without any inclination to update it. So yes.
2701 2018-03-06 19:16:52 Truth doesn't matter here. It's all about manufacturing narratives. Oil, pipeline politics and access to newly discovered natural gas fields in the Eastern Med. is what triggered the Syrian conflict.  Everyone wants a piece of the pie.

2705 2018-03-06 19:16:23 What bollix are you sprouting. Ireland would be better off as a 32 County Republic which took total control of its natural resources of Oil Gas Fishing Lead and told  the EU to go fk themselves. Great Britain no such Country. EURO ZONE OWNED BY ZIONIST'S

2720 2018-03-06 19:15:02 Then please provide evidence that producing avocados and palm oil results in more deforestation than grazing and growing feed for farmed animals. I've provided scientific evidence to the contrary, but am happy to be proved wrong.
2721 2018-03-06 19:14:30 well not NO reason. Iraq started selling oil for Euros.

2725 2018-03-06 19:14:12 That theory doesn’t hold water.  We did not put ourselves through supply shock inflation in the Carter years willingly. All we heard about was the problem of our “addiction to foreign oil” in the Bush years, as a push to open up our Alaskan reserves and the XL pipeline.

2730 2018-03-06 19:13:28 OPEC was given huge organizational help by Prescott Bush during his last year in the Senate. Oil cartels were illegal here but not in SA. Bush family made BIG investments in oil.

2778 2018-03-06 19:08:41 I bough a ‘baking oil’... apparently for my face not ma Victoria sponge but  I’ve no idea how you use this or what for.... anyone got any ideas?
2779 2018-03-06 19:08:35 5/27/2010 - Obama announced an additional 6-month moratorium on new permits for deepwater wells, a hold on planned oil exploration off the coast of Alaska, the cancellation of a scheduled August lease sale in the western Gulf & the scrubbing of a proposed lease sale off Va coast.
2780 2018-03-06 19:08:26 Castor oil mixed with olive oil. Put it on before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning. You can put it on your eyelashes too. Also you can get your eyebrows shaped and tinted at a threading place.
2781 2018-03-06 19:08:11 You should be able to cure cancer with cannibas oil , or investigate gc maf , and other cures which do work
2782 2018-03-06 19:08:04 نسبتي oil & gas الي هي جيولوجيا بس متنكره 
2783 2018-03-06 19:07:53 Makes one think - if Syria had more oil, would we be seeing trucks advertising the visit of 'Assad the Peacemaker'?
2784 2018-03-06 19:07:53 I hope everyone’s taken their positions in all these oil drills coming up in the next few weeks

2787 2018-03-06 19:07:41 Yes I agree with that statement because there are still countries that think women should be subservient and silent 2nd class citizens.  I know, because of oil, we do business with them.
2788 2018-03-06 19:07:40 Slow bake a sweet potato  (wrap it in tinfoil, high temp on oven for a couple of hours) remove and pour on some olive oil, salt & pepper, Greek yoghurt, pomegranate seeds chilli fakes if you like it spicy,  paprika and thank me later  * throw on some cilantro for fun*
2789 2018-03-06 19:07:37 @DRBC1961 #DRBCsham Robert Krause, after bumbling around with his mute button, reads an investor prospectus about the risks of oil and gas development as if that had any relevance to the matter at hand.
2790 2018-03-06 19:07:22 As per EIA website, 67% of crude oil is used as automotive fuel. That is a major chunk that can hopefully be quickly replaced by electric vehicles.
2791 2018-03-06 19:07:16 Cracked my oil pan 
2792 2018-03-06 19:07:11 even mentioning coconut oil will get you banned from my haircare and skincare groups on fb
2793 2018-03-06 19:07:11 Lol jk don’t need no oil change help .
2794 2018-03-06 19:07:05 Anyone who has been involved in the oil and gas industry since fracking became more widely used in developing oil and gas in the U.S. knows
2795 2018-03-06 19:06:52 I have lost the context of this discussion. I thought we were discussing oil prices. Expanding economy will create more jobs that is the nature of growing economic activities. Eg govt wants to build around 4m houses in rural areas for BPL, imagine how many jobs it will create.
2796 2018-03-06 19:06:50 every diy skin or hair care treatment sounds like a prank. i’m about to rub warm coconut oil into my scalp and this seems like a bad idea
2797 2018-03-06 19:06:44 Im going to try bulls eye and oil gloss on the next job where i need quick turnaround
2798 2018-03-06 19:06:37 Don't blame you. I have the full size S&W M&P 9mm and now I want a 9mm subcompact so I can put it in pockets instead of dealing with holsters.
2799 2018-03-06 19:06:31 Have u tried olive oil my kids had dry scalp and eczema as babies and that cleared it without taking their hair out
2800 2018-03-06 19:06:13 In English, it would say that I used a different oil in my car and I like it
2801 2018-03-06 19:06:12 Did you jhus say Fired ‍‍...
Put ur rice on fry pan wit a bit of olive oil
2802 2018-03-06 19:05:55 I like this,  Canada should follow the same process.  Countries need to generate the jobs and know-how from the secondary and tertiary products that crude oil and Natural Gas produce rather than just primary exporters!! Technology expands opportunity, and lowers wasteful shipping

2804 2018-03-06 19:05:48 You going to look at oil under a miscroscope... what in tarnation.
2805 2018-03-06 19:05:28 ....then it becomes brief illness

2807 2018-03-06 19:05:15 Absolutely right. 1k of Cals in veg oil is a lot different to 1k Cals in olive oil. Cal counting sends out the wrong message
2808 2018-03-06 19:05:03 Well you can put anything on top of zinsser primers. I don't have a problem or concern with w/b undercoats and oil top coats. Never had any issues before 
2809 2018-03-06 19:04:50 You are more than welcome to withdraw your claim that producing avocados and palm oil each cause more deforestation than grazing and/or growing feed for 70 billion farm animals per year.
2810 2018-03-06 19:04:48  With Scotland's oil we will be an OPEC country.
2811 2018-03-06 19:04:48 So still not as much as avacardos and palm oil then
2812 2018-03-06 19:04:35 all hotep niggas wanna do is tell you about the feminization of the blacc male, wear ankhs and sell beard oil
2813 2018-03-06 19:04:30 I mean, it sounds like you need mental help from professionals, but that's neither here/there. What I said before still stands; he's done more harm than good. Allowed an oil pipeline through Native American heritage land (which burst), given away more heritage land...and so on.
2814 2018-03-06 19:04:23 ...and the millions of birds and marine life killed in how many oil spills/rig explosions over the years?

Right.
2815 2018-03-06 19:04:15 Love me some hammerback 1911....
2816 2018-03-06 19:04:15 Please who sells coconut oil and sheer butter or whatever I hear say na wetin dey make skin dey shine
2817 2018-03-06 19:04:00 Unless Corbyn has an alternative oil / gas supply lined up, he would have to compromise on the Saudis. Although I suspect he has an alternative, but not necessarily a morally superior one.
2818 2018-03-06 19:03:54 Yo! Pollution is a real threat! Some of these side effects could be due to a a lack in air or water quality! Try using a water purification system.  One thing that helps with depression is Lavender.  Use this essential oil in your oil diffuser or topically for aromatherapy.
2819 2018-03-06 19:03:48 The LGBT community were lied to about Mateen's motive and the reason he chose Pulse niteclub. The lie was used to focus attention away from the very legitimate grievance about US killing civilians in the oil wars in the ME. You have missed the point, entirely. Have a better day.
2820 2018-03-06 19:03:47 The real question is who is drinking oil??????
2821 2018-03-06 19:03:33 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
2822 2018-03-06 19:03:23 coconut oil is 
2823 2018-03-06 19:03:22 LOL! I have thought of that, but the 9mm is a bit hard for me to handle anyway, so I figured this is a good chance to try something new.

2829 2018-03-06 19:02:31 You GOPers sure as hell are  empowering your patrons the Koch brothers in their quest to turn America into on big smoldering brown field of unregulated pollution and oil spills.

2833 2018-03-06 19:02:00 How has nobody made the obvious suggestion - get a bigger purse!
2834 2018-03-06 19:01:50 Remember Thatcher promised UK will be free of paying taxws or very little on the eve of discovery wealth of oil - when the oilfields were established she sold them and the people got nothing but closing down major industries -
2835 2018-03-06 19:01:49 Not as different as the party would like to think. Has everyone from the Blair / Brown years left the party or stopped voting for or supporting it?

I remember the Saudi oil embargo in the 1970s. They flexed their muscles and the west learned a lesson. Including Labour.
2836 2018-03-06 19:01:44 I don't need to tell myself that when its a fact. Why don't you keep telling yourself what happened with your club before 2008 and OIL MONEY
2837 2018-03-06 19:01:39 "And this is how we roll here in the mansion after a great day of evilness"

2854 2018-03-06 18:59:59 A private ship can’t use the initials USS. America has a lot of oil and Keystone pipeline so there’s no need for Russia’s oil. OPEC sales to the US is down. POTUS had signed several pieces of deregulations to make US oil production even easier.
2855 2018-03-06 18:59:47 I continue to be dissapponted in the US - imagine how great a country it could really be - generating even more jobs, innovations and a clean environment, if they just spend ½ the amount of what goes into the race for oil in sustainable energies.  I don't get their priorities.
2856 2018-03-06 18:59:46 Will probably miss out on the stream today, getting my oil changed.

If it's applied & removed correctly, use cuticle oil too, you'll have no issues!
2863 2018-03-06 18:59:06 “Technology and innovation is more of a theme that it has ever been before. The focus of the oil and gas industry is on production, but it’s also on using an immense amount of data.” - Daniel Yergin, author of The Prize. #CERAWeek18

Thank you in advance.
2865 2018-03-06 18:58:47 The shale oil boom began under Obama.  Newer and newer extraction technologies are lowering the cost of shale oil production.   The breakeven cost per barrel in the Bakken has fallen from $59.03 in 2014 to $29.44 in 2016.  The US is already close to being the top energy producer!

2870 2018-03-06 18:57:54 Why? Toyota are bound to have a decent big engine somewhere. It'll just leak oil and explode.
2871 2018-03-06 18:57:41 Depends on what they put on them. Any sort of chili oil or spice used is no go.
2872 2018-03-06 18:57:37 Told my dad how much my oil change was and how i never want a car ever again

2874 2018-03-06 18:57:19 I always feel like kicking people right where they sit when they will NOT quit referring to the oil sands as the tar sands.   Damn them to hell and back.
2875 2018-03-06 18:57:15 I'll just add as well Al! Good on you using oil. I'm using oil undercoat and gloss later on this week. Guaranteed finish!

2877 2018-03-06 18:56:51 Tillerson is an oil guy before he is anything else. His relationship with Russia was common knowledge well before being chosen for his position. Both he and his boss are deeply connected, albeit for different reasons.
2878 2018-03-06 18:56:45 Didn't know that was the term. But I would think a lot of them are on top of that having engine problems from getting oil changes never because the car does 600 miles a year and sitting for 6 months without proper storage measures.
2879 2018-03-06 18:56:39 Fried chicken? It is oil.. Oil vegans and vegetarians douse, sauté, and deep fry all of their once healthy vegetables in. Image is a lie.
2880 2018-03-06 18:56:22 want new glasses, want more tattoos, need new tires, need an oil change, need an inspection and that all requires money i do not have. :)
2881 2018-03-06 18:56:15 Cannabis oil is HIGHLY flammable. Makes you wonder
2882 2018-03-06 18:56:08 In Switzerland - oil coalition works with EMPA on the gas station of the future where other fuels will be available. so even this industry notices the change but the US is stuck on coal. #future #renewable #energy

I promise you just one Oil Block
2885 2018-03-06 18:55:39 Ready to see how this natural oil compliments my hair 
2886 2018-03-06 18:55:19 Here's the funny thing, there already exists a viable replacement for fossil fuels that burns clean & outlasts battery power and will cost 10% of current fuel costs.  But the feds protect the oil industry and refuse to fund it's development.
2887 2018-03-06 18:55:11 It was publicized several months ago that Tillerson was a partner in an oil joint venture with the Russians when he was still CEO of Exxon Mobile. Another quid pro quo. And how are those sanctions against Russia going?
2888 2018-03-06 18:55:04 My poor Jeep is getting a new radiator. Her oil pan is leaking. 10 years old with over 156,000 miles.

close loopholes for the rich (opposite of what Trump did),
Path for Dreamers,
Improve healthcare exchanges,
Have normal trade relations with every country,
Reduce our need for oil

2910 2018-03-06 18:52:34 We could name the oil fields that start springing up in the national parks for Trump. That would be more appropriate.

No matter what measures you take, how clean you keep everything, how much tea tree oil you use-  they always bring home lice. We were SO CLOSE to the end of the year and having been spared this ridiculous mess for a whole year.
2914 2018-03-06 18:52:10 Yay, CBD oil is legal again. Of course I still can't just smoke... You're getting there Indiana. Slowly, but getting there.

2916 2018-03-06 18:52:08 The animal cause gets far more media attention than palm oil
2917 2018-03-06 18:52:05 Yes, people have tried. What have I ever told you that is BS? PragerU has a lawsuit against Youtube right now. What we need is Class Action
2918 2018-03-06 18:52:01 Hello eloise I have a doubt..do we need oil immersion 100x objective to identify parasites in stool specimen or else can we identify most of the parasites without oil immersion I.e 10x ,45x
2919 2018-03-06 18:51:54 Are you suggesting that that trade would stop after Independence? We need to know now so we can start opening up new markets immediately. Will you no longer buy your gas, electricity and oil from Scotland?

2922 2018-03-06 18:51:43 It was the British that found oil in the Middle East. Ran into it deep drilling for water.

2925 2018-03-06 18:50:50 I go through so much coconut oil and coconut milk/cream  
2926 2018-03-06 18:50:50 .. going to fund AND clean it up yourself? How about @EPAScottPruitt & @EPA ? Are you going to physically be there & clean it up? How about spending weeks & months cleaning the oil off birds & other wildlife trying to save them? What a screwed up & extremely dangerous decision!

2928 2018-03-06 18:50:25 My routine, most of my life has been, coconut oil massaged into face before bath. No soap on face, the hot water removes enough of the oil to leave it face moisturizer. Amma would rub the malai from boiling milk into our faces and elbows too, if she caught us.
2929 2018-03-06 18:50:18 Considering that oil has had such an important impact on Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, there should be a monument to the first oil well.
2930 2018-03-06 18:50:17 Holiday update: turns out the oil leak from our car was caused by @Halfords_uk in Sutton not properly tightening timing chain case bolt after a service. Car fixed now, but bill heading your way @Halfords_uk.
2931 2018-03-06 18:50:15 The great prophet Malakai once said “oil and milk don’t mix”. The same could be said of kale and iceberg lettuce: why are you here, together, hectic modern salad? #lunchpoem

2980 2018-03-06 18:44:30 Thanks Obama. It was Obama that expanded fossil fuel production in America. He exposed the bull shit that we had all been told for decades that oil was scarce we would run out. That was because Bushes were running the place. keeping prices high. Obama brought down gas prices.
2981 2018-03-06 18:44:27 How the hell can you show your face in public, let alone smile? All the while selling off our public lands to the oil and gas industry. Your pretext is weak and fools no one -- your actions speak clearly. Drop dead, Mr. Zinke.

2987 2018-03-06 18:43:17 As a 30 yr oil field worker that is a lie trump did not inherit a booming oil and gas industry.
2988 2018-03-06 18:43:16 What's stopping BC from getting their gas and oil from the U.S.? Alberta is in a confederation. Leaders within it govern. Authoritarians rule their fiefdom with threats and threats will alienate rank-and-file British Columbians.

2990 2018-03-06 18:43:06 The amount of oil that gets used to make plastic is an insignificant fraction of the amount used overall.  If we could escape from fossil fuels and only used petrochemicals for building materials, we'd be in great shape on climate change.

3003 2018-03-06 18:41:45 Mango oil is really nice as well
3004 2018-03-06 18:41:42 this image is misleading—what this means is that it takes more vegetables to equal 400 calories than it would chicken or oil, but the way it’s drawn makes it look like 400 calories of vegetables is more filling somehow
3005 2018-03-06 18:41:33 This makes complete sense.  Plus the tariff' s on solar panels already causing some companies to lay off workers.  It's about oil $.  Russia doesn't have much sun & its economy grows & shrinks based on price of oil. Putin wanted the USA out of Paris climate accord.

3016 2018-03-06 18:40:28 Nunberg is a distraction.  The real story is why Rex Tillerson refuses to combat Russia's ongoing cyber threat.  He has done nothing. He's fired so many state dept employees that he doesn't even have anyone who speaks Russian. It's probably because Rex and Putin are OIL buddies.

3021 2018-03-06 18:39:38 My mom drank a bottle of castor oil to get me out, 10lb.s 2 oz. Can't blame her, it also probably 'splains a lot, I'm still a little slippery.
3022 2018-03-06 18:39:36 The Shell Oil Company originally began as a novelty shop in London that sold seashells.
3023 2018-03-06 18:39:36 Liberals have a child view on how trade works. Oil is just a good. If a tariff war were to break out, every trading country will be hurt but the strongest nations can weather the storm and force deals. Nothing will benefit Russia. Oil trade willjust stifle means sitting inRussia.

3051 2018-03-06 18:36:32 صنعاء تتغلب على أزمة المشتقات النفطية ومحطات ترفع السعر دون أن تتعرض لها الحملات The Middle East overcome the crisis of oil derivatives and stations raise the price without being exposed to the rationing campaigns التموينية
3052 2018-03-06 18:36:31 I'd already be covered in that blue oil cleanser and every last serum Sunday got.
3053 2018-03-06 18:36:28 I had to skip class cause my hair needed a hot oil treatment
3054 2018-03-06 18:36:20 #PalmOil prices seen to avg at 2,600 rgt/ton in 2018
* Palm oil issues must be resolved before any conclusion to #free-tradetalks with #EU
3055 2018-03-06 18:36:10 Could you avoid a late-book fine with merely a pinball machine, forty bottles of olive oil and a ordinary party balloon?
3056 2018-03-06 18:36:05 Or Putin told North Korea he would stop giving them oil unless they made this statement.
3057 2018-03-06 18:35:53 i told my parents i’ve never gotten my oil changed and now they’re making go to get it done??? it’s not my fault i’m gay i don’t know these things
3058 2018-03-06 18:35:51 OLIVE OIL
3059 2018-03-06 18:35:43 I just wanna smack this mf with baby oil idk why
3060 2018-03-06 18:35:42 So silly. Science grant money is tiny compared to exxon, electric utilities, etc. Countries are built on oil revenues and they buy climate denial from heartland and other paid liars that have persuaded you to ignore science and embrace denial of science.  Sad.
3061 2018-03-06 18:35:41 They have already been suspended for months now after acquiring oil fields.
3062 2018-03-06 18:35:41 I for one think Pete has done more of a positive for this team than most. Watching the oilers in last years playoffs and how Jordan “coward of the oil crush county” played drove me and a lot of others up the wall. I would take Strome over him any day.
3063 2018-03-06 18:35:39 Fancy Nancy has a winery? of course she does, so she can sell her snake oil and poisons. When is America going to wake up to the GRAFT.
3064 2018-03-06 18:35:30 Just give me my food, I could not care less about why you think big oil companies are bad
3065 2018-03-06 18:35:23 Ohh ya how about America takeing advantage of the South American resources like copper, silver, gold,oil and the production of soya. Get lost with you BS, you are so pathetic......
3066 2018-03-06 18:35:20 Does claim by invited speaker @shoffmanAB that "Alberta’s climate leadership plan, makes our Canadian climate response plan possible" – lack global vision, when in same speech the Deputy Premier advocated 296% increase in provincial oil exports in @TransMtn pipeline project?
3067 2018-03-06 18:35:17 Well, you could QWISO it into an oil, Dry ice it, into kief, decarb it and use it a million ways, or just make a tincture or canna butter. 2 grams limits the options, but as little a little a 1/4 ounce would make fun stuff.
3068 2018-03-06 18:35:15 TEI recognizes the importance of the Oil & Gas industry to the province & are happy to acknowledge Newfoundland and Labrador’s 16th Annual Oil & Gas Week that kicked off on March 5th! @OilGasWeekNL
3069 2018-03-06 18:35:12 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
3070 2018-03-06 18:34:42 I pre-poo + detangle before I wash my hair, using oil mix on lightly damp hair, split in sections and finger detangle. Twist the sections, wash hair, finger detangle again while conditioning
3071 2018-03-06 18:34:41 I have to look at it. I’m mainly watching eurusd dxy and oil

Arabian oil dollars change the result of football playes by Soccer referees!!!
3073 2018-03-06 18:34:18 Your oil won’t buy you a new Nature, climate dinosaur. Your energy policy is going full speed into a dead end.
3074 2018-03-06 18:34:12 do you really think that we rely solely on oil for revenue
3075 2018-03-06 18:34:09 You people can't fight this or create garbage hype. SA needs to reverse land back to its writefull owners, in a manner that will benefit all its people. Not Mr Mugabe style or the Nigerian way of taking back thier oil wells but the land shall come back.

3078 2018-03-06 18:34:01 I accidentally took a sip of frying oil last night, and I swear I can still taste it.
3079 2018-03-06 18:33:37 I mean in all honesty, I'd be doing it to draw Turkish Oil Wrestlers but yes that too.

3083 2018-03-06 18:33:15 He is, that's why nazis are bad now. They're only covering for commies now
3084 2018-03-06 18:32:57 But, unlike Obama, Trump's providing the defensive weapons to Ukraine and increasing our domestic oil & gas production, so Russia can't blackmail our allies.
Also Trump has strengthened the sanctions against Russia.
3085 2018-03-06 18:32:54 We were in that very spot this time last year. Also Bathsheba. If you can get to the Asa Wright centre in Trini, it is amazing. We went to Matura and saw hatching leatherbacks - Caroline was there on a turtle conservation project ten years ago. South-West is weird. Smells of oil
3086 2018-03-06 18:32:33 Glock 43, M&P Shield, or Ruger LCR. All small, light, & good quality. Also, don't carry in your purse unless you have no other option.
3087 2018-03-06 18:31:59 How can anyone applaud this bs? It's 2018!! Women's rights has grown 0.0001% in that country. Hurraay for running, how about letting women dress with whatever clothing they want!? Losing oil reserve faster than expected SA? 
3088 2018-03-06 18:31:49 haha that, witch hazel& vitamin e oil has literally changed my life, i hardly ever wear foundation anymore.
3089 2018-03-06 18:31:49 Fluid plane interface is even more fascinating as any petrology will tell you Crystal shear Planes across Landscapes Flows oil lava gas ice Deflection of energy across the earth or your car tyres on the sea coast of waves Jet Stream There are a lot of Shears on Met Office Isobars
3090 2018-03-06 18:31:32 A Trump executive orders killed oil and mining disclosures of payments made to foreign governments.
3091 2018-03-06 18:31:28 Fantastic..... We don't need to be buying oil from Saudi Arabia or any other middle eastern country anyways. They are our enemies and they hate us. MAGA.
3092 2018-03-06 18:31:22 One of the service men at the dealership wrote his phone number on my service sticker instead of the recommended mileage when I got an oil change. I ain’t been back to that dealership since. @JennE_Penny
3093 2018-03-06 18:31:21 well given both avocados and palm oil are causing more deforestation that animals and animal feed these days...

3097 2018-03-06 18:30:58 OIL DIFF: 3.38 -> 3.38
3098 2018-03-06 18:30:57 +1 on the 938, beautiful accurate gun. but some are uncomfortable with carrying cocked in single action even with the safety.
3099 2018-03-06 18:30:53 I don’t think that says much at all. That tells me that people in Edmonton have more disposable income. And it’s that arrogance which is why people don’t like Oil fans.
3100 2018-03-06 18:30:52 @LDNOverground Husband may have left black nylon bag with coffee beans, oil and spices on train from Stratford at Canonbury just now. 18.00. Where do we enquire for lost property?

3102 2018-03-06 18:30:39 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
3103 2018-03-06 18:30:36 Communism is an extreme  form of socialism & BC’s NDP is of course pro-socialism. It’s a slippery slope. BC proves this as you say by “limiting where a product can be sold or distributed its pretty much the literal definition of Communism “ This applies to oil coming in as well .
3104 2018-03-06 18:30:31 One of the biggest rackets in the world, after oil.
3105 2018-03-06 18:30:20 Our lips also lack natural protective oil making them extremely vulnerable to natural elements like cold, wind, and sun. The only way to protect your lips from these natural elements is to use lip balm or lipstick.
3106 2018-03-06 18:30:19 Tillerson is an oil guy. Trump means very little to Putin now.
3107 2018-03-06 18:30:04 Wash face with cool water, I use coconut oil its light and not greasy at all, sunscreen year round, I use this charcoal peel mask one a week...and drink lots of water

3110 2018-03-06 18:29:56 Car Guy: “What kind of engine you got in there?”

Me: Top of the line engine. Metal. Some black parts. Oil. Wipey fluid. *runs*
3111 2018-03-06 18:29:40 My beard hasn’t grown in like 5 years. Started a skin care routine and using castor, coconut oil, biotin and vitamins, and it’s grown a noticeable amount and my patches are filling in. Finally feeling good about it
3112 2018-03-06 18:29:37 No because that would kinda mess up my anonymity. Photoreal oil paintings. They go for a few thousand pounds each, depending on the size.
3113 2018-03-06 18:29:32 got any snake oil?
3114 2018-03-06 18:29:30 “WE DEMAND LOYALTY” seems an appropriate position for Imperial Oil to take.
3115 2018-03-06 18:29:10 Unlike Miguel.. No skimping with the budget there.. That uniform cost a fair bit.. Babe oil ain't cheap!

3117 2018-03-06 18:28:54 So I’m waiting at (James’) dealership for my oil changed and this guy came up and sat next to me. He started hitting on me so I told him I was married to the guy that wrote up his car. I mean. It’s James that wrote it up. But we aren’t married 
3118 2018-03-06 18:28:49 No evening oil painting class tonight!
3119 2018-03-06 18:28:46 Lol. Shey u Don discover oil finally or u still have to go down a bit?
3120 2018-03-06 18:28:42 That legislation covers spills directly from the pipeline. What about inevitable spills from increased number of ships moving the oil to/from the coast?
3121 2018-03-06 18:28:36 Relax, just for Oil change
3122 2018-03-06 18:28:35 My one irrationall (or maybe not so much) fear is that I’m going to drive into the hole when I’m driving in to get my oil changed.
3123 2018-03-06 18:28:35 Just put ur rice in frying pan,  add oil.....
Tank me later
3124 2018-03-06 18:28:33 Conductor is, if I read it right, an SEO company. It's not snake oil, it just tastes a lot like it.
3125 2018-03-06 18:28:29 It took 10 years for Parachute oil to convince customers to buy plastic bottles instead of tin. @hcmariwala in outlook business. Another example where compounding takes its own time but eventually works.

3132 2018-03-06 18:27:00 right but a lot of these folks came up watching frank gore & watching baalke sell injured rookie snake oil.  ACL’s aren’t a big deal anymore because science! :)
3133 2018-03-06 18:26:52 Has anyone got one of these 'health fryers' where you only use a spoonful of oil. Any good like?
3134 2018-03-06 18:26:49 Oh my gosh that's tragic.  Poor little thing.  Yes palm oil is bad stuff.
3135 2018-03-06 18:26:49 That's not fair am not in the picture :(
3136 2018-03-06 18:26:43 doing the coffee with coconut oil thing today. it's my life I have to make my own choices and follow my own path no matter what
3137 2018-03-06 18:26:39 Those things are the best man

I boil em in a soup, then slice them and put them back in :D

It makes it so you gotta scoop a bunch of oil off the top but the flavor is worth it
3138 2018-03-06 18:26:38 Husband is distraught. He left a black nylon bag containing coffee beans, truffle oil and spices @jubileeline train when he got off at Canada Water (from Waterloo) at 17.45 today. Any advice?
3139 2018-03-06 18:26:16 NO ONE feels secure with you at the controls, your ridiculous "trade war" will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs ( if not more!) And...who in the Hell wants to be the king of oil in an alternative energy world?

You are not at all equipped to do this job.

3144 2018-03-06 18:25:37 I have to get this out of my head so I can work! I can't understand why some political parties in Canada would be so obstructionist/daft/ disingenuous (I am not sure which one) with regards to carbon pricing in 2018. What is the problem? Ethical Oil? Russians? Weaponized Media?
3145 2018-03-06 18:25:29 I've always had good luck with garnier tbh (it's my forever fallback) and I use argan oil to keep my hair from frizzing

3150 2018-03-06 18:25:08 You just don't get it renewables cannot be the sole power source for the grid. We still need oil for energy independence and trade.
3151 2018-03-06 18:24:47 Mix together chunk light tuna, chopped celery, minced red onion, olive oil, sea salt & crushed black pepper. Serve over mixed baby greens or whatever kind of lettuce you like and add some grape or cherry tomatoes on top.

3158 2018-03-06 18:24:11 Huge thanks to @NWFFuels for giving our local oil group a very competitive price & specifically to Jemma for getting oil to me & another who’d run out / run low so quickly.

3161 2018-03-06 18:23:33 Thanks, Todd. 
Stay on track now! The point always was Foreign oil companies left Alberta in droves and they ain’t coming back until the hatred for all things fossil subsides. Lose the ‘progressive’ hatred for men that make their living and support their families in drill camps
3162 2018-03-06 18:23:28 Do u plan 2 wipe the Middle East oil producers off the map? Was that the plan in Jared's portfolio?

Me: no

18: zip ties?

Me:  JFC, can you just draw a penis on their face like everyone else!!
3164 2018-03-06 18:22:58 Their running out of money and it seems with the exception of South Korea, China, Russia and Iran sending food and oil in to the PRK--you can only eat so much grass.  That is probably the motivation for seeking peace talks.  But how long would it last?
3165 2018-03-06 18:22:49 Oil and water don't mix
3166 2018-03-06 18:22:34 I wonder how much money the Conservatives get by pushing this? Their individual connections are well known, but it the party also supported by the oil and gas industry?

3168 2018-03-06 18:22:06 The Government won’t.  The Tories signed the Barcelona Agreement which stated Muslims would be allowed to continue all their ‘cultural practices’ here and in Europe.  They sold the future to Arabs for oil.

3181 2018-03-06 18:21:05 Do you realize how idiotic your statement is, BC is basically saying we don't want oil, it's bad! So we'll just get it from the US, and what do you say to them when they tell you that the only way they'll ship that kind of volume is through a pipeline, progressive=regressive!
3182 2018-03-06 18:21:02 Saudi aramco IPO is going to crush North America OnG. They can land barrels of oil here for less then frac’ing or Tarsand extraction before refining.

3184 2018-03-06 18:20:48 A few drops of tea tree oil in your moisturizer or conditioner. Or an apple cider vinegar rinse where you dilute it water, spray some in your hair, leave it for about 20min then rinse off. Do it as a final rinse

3190 2018-03-06 18:20:08 @Barnes_Law  I asked @Jeep and @Dodge about the 2016 Jeep Renegade why does the vehicle fall dead when driving and I was told at the dealer if you don't change the oil the vehicle would burn oil and could fall dead when driving which makes it a death trap.
3191 2018-03-06 18:19:50  hmm dry or with a bit of its oil?
3192 2018-03-06 18:19:49 i’m obssessed with aromatherapy oil & suddenly today it came across my mind to roll on some of the oil onto my pillow & i’m lovin it!!!

3194 2018-03-06 18:19:44 what’s some good body oil ? not like the perfume oil but the type you can rub all over ya body.
3195 2018-03-06 18:19:44 They better chill out they’re all on welfare government has given them millions from their oil production that’s no longer the case & he’s finding ways to maintain your welfare. Or go to work.
3196 2018-03-06 18:19:29 seriously?? This is a very strange comment. What’s wrong with hiring professional foreign cheerleaders? Do we really need to have kandyan dancers for every single event? Perhaps they shud have lite the oil lamp on the pitch & refused entry to the foreigners in the stadium!?

3198 2018-03-06 18:19:20 Sounds like Afrench jealousy to me coz they have nae oil.  Funny how the cost of petrol in France is less than in the U.K. despite that

3208 2018-03-06 18:18:44 As long as world bows to oil based economy and remains ill with the disease of consumption, the Earth will suffer. We are all responsible.
3209 2018-03-06 18:18:43 I would try CBD oil but I am taking a lot of medication and it would have a negative effect on my prescription medication, I have hear some folk say it does help and I have heard some folk say it did nothing for them..
3210 2018-03-06 18:18:30 @robynallan Hi Robyn, Mark Villani with CTV Calgary. Would you be able to give me a quick call to chat about a recent School of Public Policy study on oil price differential? 403-437-8970 Thank you

3212 2018-03-06 18:18:18 @seanhannity just posted a story about American oil production proceeded by the word BOOM.
3213 2018-03-06 18:18:08 But they contain palm oil. What is the point of being vegan if we purchase products that use palm oil, which is destroying the world's forests and facing many animals like the Sumtran elephant and orangutan with extinction. Please do not support products using palm oil
3214 2018-03-06 18:17:59 Does GSC cover medical marijuana or cannabis oil?  @GSC_1957
3215 2018-03-06 18:17:56 Fillet fried fish with some provision and coconut oil. Oh lord and a two soft dumpling. I would wife you Naila 
3216 2018-03-06 18:17:46 pretty much every vegetable you hated as a little kid would taste better if you roasted it with salt and olive oil instead of boiling it
3217 2018-03-06 18:17:44 My nutritionist yesterday: idk why anyone would eat Keto. It’s completely disgusting & processed. You don’t need that much fat, think about your heart/cholesterol and all that butter, fat, oil & cream oozing through your body. You can’t sustain weight loss on keto... #eatclean
3218 2018-03-06 18:17:31 @SenCarmichaelWV you'd have found that money last week if it would have been a tax cut for oil or gas. We know it.
3219 2018-03-06 18:17:18 This would have been news 50 years ago. The rest of the world has moved on to clean energy. No one wants or needs oil anymore. Or coal. Or steel. Or VHS. Or racism. Or sexism. Or dictators. Join us in the 21st, won’t you?
3220 2018-03-06 18:17:13 All these Snapchat cam girls have all these friends that hang out topless and rub oil on each other’s giant butts and they’re all hot like where do you find these friends do they want to be my friend I have a Snapchat too
3221 2018-03-06 18:17:04 maverick uses coconut oil to clean her fur
3222 2018-03-06 18:17:01 But where does it state that this vehicle will burn oil and stop in the middle of driving the vehicle? There is no disclaimer for this and this makes your company liable for anything that may happen to individuals who drive this death trap.
3223 2018-03-06 18:16:59 Thought Walter Duranty was long dead?
3224 2018-03-06 18:16:55 Will cannabis oil be covered by Green Shield?

3229 2018-03-06 18:16:26 @Greenpeace @GreenpeaceUK @friends_earth @TheGreenParty Oh, really? Like Hell it does! The only sensible thing to do with #oil & #gas is to leave the stuff in the ground. If we keep on burning them for much longer we can kiss goodbye to the Paris Accord #climatechange targets.
3230 2018-03-06 18:16:00 I don’t think it is Tillerson/oil that we need t worry about. I worry about Perry/nukes.
3231 2018-03-06 18:15:35 I'm vaping but only the tree oil if you're picking up what I'm putting lmao
3232 2018-03-06 18:15:29 We should stop burning Fossilised material like oil and coal as we need them as a Base material in the chemical industry for everything from medicines to plastics. It is much easier to replace them with cheaper more efficient renewable energy.
3233 2018-03-06 18:15:25 Somebody bring a boxcar of baking soda.
3234 2018-03-06 18:15:23 If you look past the oil money invested in 2013 onwards.... I don’t think the honours board is at all impressive.

I swear 2018 is gonna be the year I get my shit together and keep my body in check
3244 2018-03-06 18:14:27 A couple of £200m away sounds plausible. As the oil will be needed to this world that's not very far away to achieve that.
3245 2018-03-06 18:14:11 Rosemary essential oil! Dilute and rub on temples.
3246 2018-03-06 18:14:00 if they had spent 40 years with soldiers in north america...messing with our governments, destroying our hospitals and schools, stealing our oil....would we just sit there and take it? or would we fight back? :P don't want terrorists?...don't fund oil wars ;)

3249 2018-03-06 18:13:38 Should be impressive they have oil money and no competition

3256 2018-03-06 18:13:13 castor oil applied topically or get them tinted or just fill them in w makeup tbh
3257 2018-03-06 18:13:09 I think I’ve traumatised the cat from going outsideOn Sunday, she was outside and got herself covered in a black oil. When she came in I had to give her a bath. Which went surprisingly well, the drying, not so much. But now every time  I open the door she runs and hide 
3258 2018-03-06 18:13:06 Dammit! Jackass!!
3259 2018-03-06 18:13:03 Opposite predictions for me. I will happy if Arsenal lose Milan by a margin.
3260 2018-03-06 18:12:55 FFS, you had nothing to do with the oil production either in Russia or here. We've been on track to overtake them for years. Try actually doing your job and you won't have to invent fantasy accomplishments all the time.
3261 2018-03-06 18:12:48 The thing Repubs fail to understand is Millenials & Gen Z care about things like the environment, lgbtq rights, womens rights, equal pay, etc. Everything the GOP hates. They care a lot less about the supoosed GOP principles of Oil, Coal, making the rich richer, etc. 
#Repubprob
3262 2018-03-06 18:12:45 Subing sugar for oil. Seems legit 
3263 2018-03-06 18:12:45 Two top Middle East national #oil companies CEOs spoke today at #CERAWeek. Both #Aramco and #ADNOC talked at length about their new investing in petrochemicals and refining. None talked about new upstream capacity. Just saying. #OOTT
3264 2018-03-06 18:12:44 Unfortunately, the problem doesn't just lie in responsible disposal.  Plastic is lightweight & escapes easily into our environment. Not to mention the pollution created from the drilling of oil, manufacture & transport of plastic. The answer is simple: #refusedisposableplastic
3265 2018-03-06 18:12:42 Engineers always try to relate their narrow field into all aspects of life.
3266 2018-03-06 18:12:37 I remember, during the oil spill, they had robots go down to try to fix it.  He literally said “what were those robots thinking?” WTAF?!?

3268 2018-03-06 18:12:22 Oil pass on that!
3269 2018-03-06 18:12:20 Let’s be honest, there was no blundering. BP, Exxon , Chevron are now doing 100 mil a day out of Iraq oil fields. It was always about the oil. We just as a nation destroyed a country and killed thousands so we could drive our SUVS. That is the real blunder, as climat warms.
3270 2018-03-06 18:12:20 Which is why he needs a lesson in humility and actual economics of oil & gas. Tariffs may also do the trick. Notley’s social license paid for by the #CarbonTax theft is clearly worth spit in all this. 2/2
3271 2018-03-06 18:12:19 read online just oil garlic, lots of heat and quick saute. I'll probably put lemon pepper on bc he likes that on his salmon.
3272 2018-03-06 18:12:19 Data is the new oil
3273 2018-03-06 18:12:10 Wilson, its not oil companies refusing to pay this rate. The money oil conpanies are using to pay PAPs comes from government as you heard one of PAUs mandates is to minimise cost.

3280 2018-03-06 18:11:10 Spray a little citronella oil on it
3281 2018-03-06 18:11:00 Yeah I sub here in the suburbs of OKC. They've had problems funding the schools since I was a kid. Even back then the schools were broke. They say they don't have the money to give raises but they have the money to give tax cuts to the oil companies. It's sick.
3282 2018-03-06 18:10:59 Mine are Jim Inhofe and Jeff Langford. 
Inhofe is an oil man. 
Langford is the guy that sounds like he might help but he is a liar too. 
We are fighting our asses off in Oklahoma.

3286 2018-03-06 18:10:21 @TankTopper1 hello. I’ve just ordered some oil to be delivered in ten days or under. Just realised I’ve put the billing address down then same as the shipping address. This isn’t where I need the oil to be. Can someone help me sort this please?
3287 2018-03-06 18:10:17 Sounds therapeutic. Why isn't he doing this on public access Rob Ross style? "Here come some angry little polar bears - they don't like the lamestream media, but man do they love oil pipelines!"
3288 2018-03-06 18:10:13 I just want to dip my whole self in a lake full of olive or argan oil #Eczema #DrySkin

3290 2018-03-06 18:10:09 I dont know if anyone younger will understand the absolute shock and impossibility of how much oil we have.
3291 2018-03-06 18:10:06 ”A study from 2016 found that without the emissions from burning coal and oil, there is very little likelihood that 13 out of the 15 warmest years on record would all have happened.”

Yeah sure.

3294 2018-03-06 18:09:56 It's called oil that you love Hicks even though she admittedly lied to us. It's what that entire admin does.
3295 2018-03-06 18:09:53 Lolololol...Obama was very proactive in oil but facts don’t matter with idiots.
3296 2018-03-06 18:09:47 Our economy can't depend on oil any more. The world is changing and we need to adapt. #ableg #abpoli
3297 2018-03-06 18:09:30 Exactly my point. Horgan is pandering to tree-hugging ignoramuses who think it’s best to limit responsible Canadian oil while completely unaware they’re importing from the US and conflict regimes with lousy safety and social standards. 1/
3298 2018-03-06 18:09:27 Mum just bought some cannabis oil..because she said she wants to try getting high..
3299 2018-03-06 18:09:22 I hate getting an oil change by myself bc they always try to con me into paying for stuff I don’t need 
3300 2018-03-06 18:09:19 Bit more oil money needed

3307 2018-03-06 18:08:43 So my car is burning oil at an exponential rate which is dope
3308 2018-03-06 18:08:41 Nah edibles work too well. Although I just got some CBD oil so I’m gonna try that
3309 2018-03-06 18:08:38 Haaa baby oil
3310 2018-03-06 18:08:34 Maybe the US is planning on exporting excess oil to eastern Canada if they can shut enough Canadian pipelines

3314 2018-03-06 18:07:56 So I was into geopol particularly Africa - blogging a lot about Sudan/Abyei oil fault lines, also the Great Lakes so I had an expertise. Focused on women mainly too. I also spoke a few languages. Before going to work in a pub I would present a show on local community radio.
3315 2018-03-06 18:07:53 True. But Trump’s approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines is a huge step toward cutting US dependency on foreign oil, raising US GDP ( by $3 Billion) and facilitating US growth overall, especially domestically.
3316 2018-03-06 18:07:45 If you have no problems chambering a semi-automatic my Walther PPK 380 nice. If you have problems then a 38 or a 357 revolver 5 shot are very slim and have lasers built in. My daughter has a Smith & Wesson 380 Bodyguard with a laser.
3317 2018-03-06 18:07:43 Looking forward to it! 
For the hair, try cocunut oil 
3318 2018-03-06 18:07:41 so the problem is that in the past, i lived at my parents' house. which had a driveway. so my dad would help me change my own oil.

Put the spicy olive oil before putting it in the oven, not after. 

Thank me later.

3325 2018-03-06 18:07:06 A lot of talk in Alberta about Notley’s NDP Govt to easy on BC NDP minority Govt. 
Section 92 A of the 1982Constitution Act gave the province the power to limit to flow of goods out of Alberta. They did it legally in 82 & issued no permits to export oil east. It ended quickly
3326 2018-03-06 18:06:56 use tea tree oil!!!!!
3327 2018-03-06 18:06:41 What is going on here? Why are US celebrities commenting on Canadian energy when the US is ramping up oil production to be an net exporter. Maybe they realize Canada is closest competitor.
3328 2018-03-06 18:06:34 Once the arctic oil leases have been divvied up between the US and Russia, Tillerson will disappear back into the corporate world.

#trumprussia is all about the oil$.  Deals made now, will be impossible to unwind later.

3331 2018-03-06 18:06:12 I imagine that they harbor a similar disdain for other low fidelity mediums like watercolor, oil paint, lost-wax casting, and woodblock ink prints.
3332 2018-03-06 18:06:04 Redi Tlhabi once said, if the presidential plane is leaking oil, why didn't they just clean it and take-off, that's when I told myself I'd never EVER listen to talk radio. My ears cannot be disrespected with that kind of stupidity.

3335 2018-03-06 18:05:49 I’ve had so many bad experiences with Oilers fans. I agree tho there are bad fans in every city. The only issue I have with Oil fans is they have this arrogance and believe they are the best fans in the NHL. They aren’t any better.
3336 2018-03-06 18:05:44 all the oil do is make it oily  it don’t do nothing!!

3346 2018-03-06 18:04:40 Well, we can produce them solely for the oil. But don’t sell them to me at the farmers market. It’ll ruin a Tuesday real quick.
3347 2018-03-06 18:04:29 Tillerson is thinking about his stock holding in Exxon. He still wants Exxon to do oil exploration in Russia. He afraid that Putin will retaliate if he does what is right for the Americans. These corporate reactionaries have no loyalty the country. Sad.

3372 2018-03-06 18:01:15 Here's some advice for #TipTuesday, #car owners. You should change your oil every 5,000 miles to avoid engine wear!
3373 2018-03-06 18:01:08 This bill allows CBD Oil from hemp only correct?
3374 2018-03-06 18:01:07 Oil is the past. You just dhy#it down huge portions of the future!
3375 2018-03-06 18:01:07 Oil prices seem to be the most obvious driver.
3376 2018-03-06 18:01:06 Why is no one talking about how the United States is about to become the worlds largest oil producer again?! 
Why is no one talking about NORTH KOREA saying they are willing to abandon their nuclear program? 
Because good stories of Trump are overshadowed by hit pieces always.
3377 2018-03-06 18:01:06 I said before shut it off, 2 reason put oil tankers in their ports, get them use to tankers off the cost so they can get the lng facility up and running
3378 2018-03-06 18:01:00 Had anyone ever REALLY tried or this is just more BS to prevent others from trying?
3379 2018-03-06 18:00:46 There just aren't that many jobs in oil buddy.

3384 2018-03-06 18:00:19 The robots when the take over will be out for you not giving that artist-bot it's minimum wage and oil
3385 2018-03-06 18:00:03 The industry’s already 7/8 gone. Paul if you could share your secret how you drive all year without using oil that would be a good start. Otherwise can it. The liberals can buy all Canadians Tesla’s and have free charging infrastructure built. Guess what? That ain’t gonna happen.
3386 2018-03-06 17:59:58 At what price? trump makes offers to both sides of every issue, so one can never say he didn't try. In the end, his (and in this case Kelly's) true colors come out. Snake oil salesman. He reneged on his offer to Dem leaders.
3387 2018-03-06 17:59:53 No, take steps to counter foreign Govt subsidized goods & services which end businesses & jobs here in the US so they can then raise prices as no domestic competition, like oil until recently

3390 2018-03-06 17:59:42 Yes the snake oil types are literally selling information on how to retire early so *they* can retire early. It makes my head hurt.
3391 2018-03-06 17:59:41 Let me guess — Big Oil, Big Coal and the rest of the F*** the Planet caucus
3392 2018-03-06 17:59:38 My brother swears by CBD oil. He uses it daily. I’ve tried it and it does nothing for me. I’m definitely a freak of nature.
3393 2018-03-06 17:59:37 you proved nothing except that you are a very poor unionist troll, the educated amongst us know that the price of oil fluctuates on a daily basis and anyone with an education knows that its about what you have left to sell when the price is good
3394 2018-03-06 17:59:34 It kind of looks like an oil well from the angle. Sure. But not knowing a sport team's logo and thinking 2 different faces look the same is very different.
3395 2018-03-06 17:59:32 Does anyone out there have any experience of using or know about CBD oil for insomnia?
3396 2018-03-06 17:59:04 Who here also has extremely low Vit D levels? Also why must that oil thing be taken in that form only 
3397 2018-03-06 17:58:59 See Dax, I told you! I told Dax, I never had kids, but I hear a toothache is worse!  I've had them before.  

But I did hear "Tea Tree Oil" also helps!  My God I get a ache just thinking of the pain! 
3398 2018-03-06 17:58:56 Great, I love a good oil slick floating in the ocean or down a river because it won't matter at all since notions of clean water have been recently de-regulated.
3399 2018-03-06 17:58:51 Same I put leave in and coconut oil 20 minutes go by and it’s like I’ve never done it

3401 2018-03-06 17:58:32 How much would it cost us, before we realize localisation of oil refining is our only way out. #Nigeria has to end all oil importations soon..
3402 2018-03-06 17:58:30 We had an extended oil boom, yet we emerged further in debt as a prov. Spare me on how this is great news. Yes, we don't control the prices, we just control how we spend the resource revenues.

3404 2018-03-06 17:58:09 The initial mistake you made was not using motor oil.  I'm surprised your car even ran on milk.

3413 2018-03-06 17:57:41 Trying to dry oily skin with harsh ingredients like alcohol actually has the opposite effect. As a reaction to the drying ingredient, the skin increases oil production as part of its healing and balancing processes #skincare
3414 2018-03-06 17:57:38 I told ya. I watch shark tank faithfully bc I owned a biz for two decades and you do learn things from those people... Damon said he wanted to invest in this one woman really bad but he had deep pockets and CA it’s easy to be ‘class action’ sued. I foresee that in their future.
3415 2018-03-06 17:57:37 There are some that have an authentic feel (e.g. why I like the Frugalwoods). But I do dislike how many give me a snake oil salesman vibe. Plus, lots are SUPER dogmatic in the approach and I hate their condescension for those who aren't super-frugal/FIRE.

3418 2018-03-06 17:57:18 Better do yours. Just Google oil production by country. LOL
3419 2018-03-06 17:57:13 lmao, you really are clutching at straws here, in the first place oil was never the backbone of Scotlands finance & secondly what is there to stop us doubling production if we really did have to rely solely on the price of oil
3420 2018-03-06 17:57:08 It's not creating more jobs, it's simply creating more pollution, earthquakes, wasting potable water (which is the oil of the future) and we have all the oil we need, you just want to despoil the country for a handful to make money selling oil to China.
3421 2018-03-06 17:56:58 I believe it. Look up how much oil land Exxon owns in Russia. Tillerson was Exxon CEO.
3422 2018-03-06 17:56:55 "i know for a FACT if you let him hit it he would not only lay the pipe he would FRACK the pipe."
"my god i'm talking oil spill baby."

Regina and i are disgusting
3423 2018-03-06 17:56:54 Not only did they pledge in 1994, they held off any production for 8 years after Clinton offered them the Agreed Framework.  We promised them food and oil aid, promised to establish eventual diplomatic relations, and promised eventual recognition of NK as a legitmate country

3432 2018-03-06 17:56:09 So, oil companies are not willing to pay 60,000/- for a mature water melon plant as it is in the 2018 Buliisa District Compensation rates, they are terming it 'anomalies"  PAPs with them have not been disclosed to.

3437 2018-03-06 17:55:24 I have no use for Nye and never will. I cannot stand fake people with their hidden agenda. Oil extraction is more environmentally sound now than it has been in 40 years. 

I support the environment and the economy. I do not support push clean technology at all costs!

3439 2018-03-06 17:54:31 Tell me Jill,,how would oil and gas rich Scotland be poorer than No oil or gas rUK?
Also rUK will be poorer when scots take back that 92% of revenue ,so that covers yer wee 13.3BN
3440 2018-03-06 17:54:25 how do you know? have we tried not setting up puppet regimes? have we tried not invading for oil? want to think of America first? some spending close to half of your taxes on blowing up foreign lands..stop trying to control the world :P
3441 2018-03-06 17:54:19 Let’s hope one day they can find a cure for this I’ve suffered for 23 years now and nothing is working the only slight thing that’s changed is my diet and increase of water which has helped along side pure coconut oil x
3442 2018-03-06 17:54:09 The U.S. is likely to overtake Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2023, accounting for most of the global growth in petroleum supplies. This is good news for people like me who work for #oilandgas companies in the US!
3443 2018-03-06 17:54:09 soaked my hair in coconut oil last night...washed & straightened my hair this morning & it feels AMAZEEEEEE
3444 2018-03-06 17:54:01 Does it really take 2 hours fo an oil change??? Wtf
3445 2018-03-06 17:53:45 Horses**t. It was the Nebraska farmers that held it up. Then They mothballed it anyway because they didn’t have the commitment for oil to flow through. It was already 90% built anyway

3447 2018-03-06 17:53:36 That one's ink and watercolor and not oil, by the way.
3448 2018-03-06 17:53:34 Liberal hate, resistance, & obstruction runs deep. 
It would appear the Clinton cabal/cartel has evidence that can be held against people and agencies that will ruin them if they don't protect HRC and aggressively go after @realDonaldTrump, his agenda, administration, and family.
3449 2018-03-06 17:53:08 Bingo! Why did Trump hire Tillerson to begin with? He didn't know Tillerson and Tillerson was an oil executive with no foreign policy experience. I would like to know what other policies did Russia influence.

3461 2018-03-06 17:51:45 The other dish is roasted zucchini with parmesan. I would cut them in chunks and then toss them in a bit of olive oil to coat them, then spread them in a pan and sprinkle parm on them, and cook on high heat in the oven until tender.

3463 2018-03-06 17:51:34 Yep. Jared is a common fixture within the UCP, supporters who blindly buy all of Kenney's snake oil without fact checking what safe injection sites actually are and do.
3464 2018-03-06 17:51:29 Even with record oil production, we're beholden to OPEC and its partner nations, part of the 40 percent in oil imports we need to satisfy our 19M barrel-a-day habit. Alternatives, complementing shale production, is the only way to get to energy independence, much less dominance.
3465 2018-03-06 17:51:14 I keep getting popped for these oil changes.
3466 2018-03-06 17:50:59 In the end, like most things, I am betting this all comes down to oil.  My guess is Trump owns a share of Rosneft.

3592 2018-03-06 17:38:26 At one time, we laughed at the Middle East, content to use up their natural resources as we prepared for the new clean energy technologies of the future.

3602 2018-03-06 17:37:13 Maybe that's why he was fired from the Trump campaign after such a short time. Meanwhile,  Hillary and her husband were paid millions for a few hours of speeches to Wall Street, Russian oligarchs, oil sheiks, and the like.
3603 2018-03-06 17:37:12 "ma'am, do you take any herbal supplements or things not perscribed by a doctor?"

Patient: "does emu oil count?"

"Emu... Like the giant bird?"

"Yep, emu."

"You know, I think that counts."

3605 2018-03-06 17:37:06 Essential oils on the other hand, are totally snake oil
3606 2018-03-06 17:37:02 there’s nothing like a coat of coconut oil on freshly shaved legs
3607 2018-03-06 17:37:00 The same size I just bought of the castor oil one. I think 16 oz.
3608 2018-03-06 17:37:00 I have several other prints but my Cesaro is an oil painting and definitely my favorite. I need to get a picture of the each of the prints when I get home.
3609 2018-03-06 17:36:45 CBD is like cure all snake oil but it actually work
3610 2018-03-06 17:36:38 Don't forget to also try and broker the Russian oil deal for Exxon. #RussianSanctions
3611 2018-03-06 17:36:31 Tune into @BBCAfrica on @BBCWorld News channel now featuring our investigation into South Sudan’s state oil company Nilepet and how profits are financing corruption and the deadly civil war.
3612 2018-03-06 17:36:30 After writing all these. Whoever that has connections or a brother working in an oil company will just use connect to get job and you hat wrote stories will still be at home..
3613 2018-03-06 17:36:19 That’s funny! Cozy with oil & gas? That’s real funny!
3614 2018-03-06 17:36:13 It’s very distracting

3616 2018-03-06 17:36:02 Well most of your hi gas prices are due to your hi taxes. Oil is thrown into the stock market and sold at market prices. Not sure what the price is now but it’s been as much as 150 a barrel. Think it’s 50 to 60 a barrel
3617 2018-03-06 17:36:00 Welcome to getting older. I feel it as well. Start taking glucosamine &/or fish oil pills daily. You’ll feel it but it won’t ruin your day.
3618 2018-03-06 17:35:56 Pruitt is nothing more than a lobbyist for the oil & gas industry
3619 2018-03-06 17:35:48 My thoughts on trading today.

#NatGas take off already
Oil needs to tank asap
Soybeans.... WTF die already 

#Natty #oil #soybeans
3620 2018-03-06 17:35:29 They will replace the supply with US oil and we will have less markets to sell in creating a bigger problem for Alberta
3621 2018-03-06 17:35:17 My grandma accidentally bought vape oil instead of essential oil
3622 2018-03-06 17:35:13 gotta get an oil change and a lineup for my date tmrw

3624 2018-03-06 17:35:03 okay that was what i thought & i’m already using castor oil thank u!! 
3625 2018-03-06 17:35:02 First they hunt for a weak politician. Donate to his riding to his people and they promise him with their full support to win the election. And when he is in 
follow the saudi oil money(donation) 
This is done on every level of government
3626 2018-03-06 17:34:57 Coconut oil really soothes and help it clear up xx
3627 2018-03-06 17:34:54 Lol thank you! they just don't hold a curl for very long so it's not that noticeable  the coconut oil and caster oil hair mask sounds like a good one for you and for lashes I would do just caster oil keep it simple. I'm going to try those two myself.
3628 2018-03-06 17:34:40 Saudi oil min Yamani kept cutting Saudi production down to 2m bpd & Aramco lost a lot of money from that. Had to mothball facilities, scale back capex, delay new projects, lay people off. The company doesn't see itself as a member of a cartel in the way we might.

3635 2018-03-06 17:33:40 Yeah, my 3 skinny kids HATE this dinner... So do me & my healthy BMI husband. The oil.. The sausage fat..the spice...the chewy crunchy bread.. Oh god I'm so hungry..
3636 2018-03-06 17:33:39 You obviously don't know enough about the EU and why the UK joined. Look at Norway, they have what we might end up with regarding imports and tariffs. While they can afford it having over a trillion oil fund, we can't. Scotland would also have had a fund if it was not squandered.
3637 2018-03-06 17:33:31 @kapil_tandon best thing about this market fall is,all snake oil conferences will see less interest , there is one in maharashtra in a few days 
3638 2018-03-06 17:33:23 For what its worth, a majority of Nigeria's GDP is the oil industry. Corrupt at that.
3639 2018-03-06 17:33:02 I have the Burt’s bees moisturizer and the thing that helps the most for acne is the coconut oil everything else is just for taking makeup off and smooth skin
3640 2018-03-06 17:32:54 However, it is unnecessary. As far as I know, France is the only country among the 20 biggest economies on Earth in which oil or coal are not their #1 source of primary energy.
3641 2018-03-06 17:32:51 Doing coconut oil  pulling on my teeth
3642 2018-03-06 17:32:44 Today I had my first raindrop massage, the massage itself was actually amazing & I enjoyed the oil dripped on my back (1/2)
3643 2018-03-06 17:32:40 how much oil do i have to shove in my ear to get rid of this wax build-up? i just want to be not deaf on one side thank you

3646 2018-03-06 17:32:17 This president loves his Country and wants he best for them. He reminds me of how palm oil was taken from nigeria to Malaysia 
 ago and today they are the largest producer in the world.
3647 2018-03-06 17:32:09 Please tell us about the great tariff failures in American history, Ben. This country was built on tariffs. Sell your CofC, Uniparty snake oil somewhere else.

3648 2018-03-06 17:32:07 I’m getting patronized over not getting my oil changed on time. 
3649 2018-03-06 17:31:57 Thanks. Nothing like an ice cold oil can ...

3651 2018-03-06 17:31:37 With this stance he can't be elected, political suicide. Alberta currently has only one oil pipeline to move Ft Mac oil and it belongs to Kinder Morgan. Block it and Alberta could face massive deficits and tax increases. Maybe even HST
3652 2018-03-06 17:31:35 Only time my car get washed is when I take it to get an oil change
3653 2018-03-06 17:31:22 Never did and never will. He is the modern day snake oil salesman who fooled the gullible masses into believing his schtick. The plight of the World rests on America's shoulders and we damn well better turn it around.

3655 2018-03-06 17:31:11 Can somebody pay for oil change
3656 2018-03-06 17:31:08 You have absolutely nothing to do with oil.  Nothing you’ve done regulation wise or policy wise has had any effect on how much oil and gas we’re pumping out of the ground.  But, by all means take credit for it. You take credit for everything else you haven’t done.
3657 2018-03-06 17:31:06 eu gosto muito da total control da nyx em relação ao tempo de duração e o efeito que faz na pele também até porque é oil free, não sei é se fará o tal efeito bronzeado que queres
3658 2018-03-06 17:30:52 A Prof Mark Gigliotti on BBCPM giving a thought through foreign policy for the UK involving both demonising and punishing Russia with no proven evidence on origins of Russian ex spy poisoning! Clearly an axe to grind as Russia protects Syria/Iran frm ME oil/land/pipelines grab!

Not bothering to put anything on, Steve rummaged around in the first aid kit, pulling out a bottle of lavender medicinal oil and fresh bandages.

"All right, doll. Lie on your back." He instructed, pouring a little of the -
3664 2018-03-06 17:29:34 Absolutely! Homemade are real treats. Instead of watching calories, we look for additives, palm oil, cheap oil

3666 2018-03-06 17:29:09 Not being able to speak Spanish in the oil field is eating me up..
3667 2018-03-06 17:29:07 The 5:5 is a little darker because of the CBD. But the consistency is very similar to our current 10:1 oil.
3668 2018-03-06 17:28:34 just dropped my car off for an oil change I’m adulting today 
3669 2018-03-06 17:28:34 Coincido, hasta cierto punto, por el hecho que el mismo pri se asume como la solución a nuestros males; algunos de los cuales son responsables... Claro que nosotros como ciudadanos también tenemos amplia culpa de la situación actual...
3670 2018-03-06 17:28:27 Standing up for hunters by decimating our public lands to the new "public" meaning oil, gas, mining and any other extractive industry.  For a DOI secretary and supposed Montanan that can't quite figure out a flyfishing rig... "support of hunters" is a ruse. A sportsman he ain't.
3671 2018-03-06 17:28:14 Sending feature length productions off to QC is the most stressful part of this process. It's usually not about the report  outlining fixable problems, every show has them. Differences in communication between each QC vendor are where the gears need more oil.
3672 2018-03-06 17:28:09 Destruction due to fracking and oil, mineral extraction is well known. Hope hypersonic drilling, tunneling will be for good purposes.

3676 2018-03-06 17:27:57 For the fresh leaves you could try juicing them or making bubble hash, or making cannabis oil (Smokable or Edible), or I'll take some fresh ones sent out to me for photo's, I actually have none, or find an extract producer for concentrates or terpenes...
3677 2018-03-06 17:27:54 Tonight's PH panic attack inducing dinner..

Hunks of granary bread covered in olive oil, put in oven dish. Add chunks of sweet potato tossed in sweet smoked paprika & more olive oil. Throw in 12 chopped sausages. More olive oil. Toss. Rosemary springs. More oil. Bake.

3689 2018-03-06 17:26:46 I need a foot rub, back rub, belly rub, bum bum rub, but instead of the massager using oil I'd rather dollars
3690 2018-03-06 17:26:45 Eating another salad for lunch. It has beans and avocado. Tiny bit of oil and vinegar. Is this healthy? #salad #HealthyEating
3691 2018-03-06 17:26:45 I’m convinced aloe, tea tree oil, and honey have magical powers. Mix those 3 things with anything and the glo up will be real!
3692 2018-03-06 17:26:41 Let me guess: one has no clue that import tariffs increase prices on consumers, prop inflation, raise interest rates, and unemployment.
And that’s just of the top.

But heck, snake oil salesmen sold you promises.
3693 2018-03-06 17:26:39 Drill we need oil

3701 2018-03-06 17:25:47 As a country we are not poor at all, it’s the mindset that need renewal!  Dubai 30 years ago was just a desert and today it’s a tourism city! The only have one natural resource and that oil! Zim we have plenty more than UAE  and with th right mindset we can do it

3710 2018-03-06 17:24:48 Pruitt and Zinke. They are the worst of the worst. Destroying our beautiful country for greed: mining, fracking, oil and coal, and all the other industries that can squeeze a buck out of National Monuments, wildlife preserves, everything sacred that can be desecrated for profit.
3711 2018-03-06 17:24:43 It frames the opening of Shanghai oil futures on the 26th as an affront to the USA & Trump that will play well with the voting base I imagine .
3712 2018-03-06 17:24:41 I started a "no oil" trend at folgers in the pasta line 5 people after me did the same thing 
3713 2018-03-06 17:24:31 She sold oil leases to foreign countries or she sold the reserves. Off shore drilling and fracking have had a boom in the US.

3715 2018-03-06 17:24:22 It's amazing how little appetite there is within football to acknowledge the moral bankruptcy at the heart of the oil money clubs.
3716 2018-03-06 17:24:19 Oh yeah! I am into arts: personally draw (pencil, charcoal, ink) and paint (oil on canvas, tempera, acrylic). I'll post some pictures one of these days.
3717 2018-03-06 17:24:16 lavender oil is perfect.
3718 2018-03-06 17:23:55 we have leftover fry oil leftover but its not solidifying... how do i get rid of it? can i recycle it? ideas?
3719 2018-03-06 17:23:34 Yup. All of this is about oil.
3720 2018-03-06 17:23:34 I should really be a sales representative for Saje essential oil products... I've convinced 2 people in 3 days to buy it.
3721 2018-03-06 17:23:24 Jobless claims have plunged to a 49-year low
US manufacturing expanded at the fastest rate since 2004
The nation broke a 47-year record in crude oil production
Don't panic about a trade war!
3722 2018-03-06 17:23:18 In a few years, the US will be finished as a great economic power - nothing lasts forever, and new contenders will take over. Then you will be unable to sustain your enormous military machine. How will you cope with your oil addiction then?
3723 2018-03-06 17:23:15 OIL is responsible to fuel our MILITARY. Yeah Oil is a security fuel. Oil also is used to make products like gun stocks, gas masks, hospital equipment, explosives and other ordinances—the list can go on. Cockpit materials.

3725 2018-03-06 17:22:35 3/ WaPo article says next Monday's (Mar 13) oil & natural gas lease auction was to include "109 parcels stretching across the Big Sky State from the Canadian border to Wyoming."
Zinke withdrew 26 parcels (& portions of 2 others) which total about 17,300acres from auction. (con't)
3726 2018-03-06 17:22:31 We can't. We don't own enough of our own oil to make it work anymore. Thatcher sold it. Check out Norway's oil reserves and sovereign fund - They didn't sell theirs. Yes, Saudi oil is what we depend on. That's why we're supplying weapons and fighting their wars for them :(
3727 2018-03-06 17:22:30 Cannabis oil really works for pain!  Order as much as you can before government hike prices!

3730 2018-03-06 17:22:06 oils promote hair growth, so put coconut oil on before bed and leave it overnight. Castor and olive oil work too. There are also serums and stuff out there meant to grow thicker eyelashes and brows you can find at Sephora, etc.
3731 2018-03-06 17:22:03 I have them done occasionally & always have removed in salon. Use their cuticle oil nightly & nails are fine. However in the days when I had it done regularly & removed myself nails were in bits. Learned my lesson. Also worth checking out who you go to as lots use rip off polish
3732 2018-03-06 17:21:52 Yeah I think Russell is a good indication of the sincerity of the moves.  Oil has been leading SPY for a few days now

3741 2018-03-06 17:20:50 I remember when e-cigs and vaping was taking off... who would have thought inhaling large amounts of unknown chemicals might have some carcinogenic ingredients?  not to mention the veggie oil causing popcorn lung... 
3742 2018-03-06 17:20:46 Great post. I’m turning 31 this year and as you said I have a lot more skin care popping up. Good to know the difference now between a serum and oil.
3743 2018-03-06 17:20:44 What type of fry oil do you use?
3744 2018-03-06 17:20:36 Can I just say coconut oil is actually a blessing I just started using it again yesterday and my face is CLEARed and GLOWing
3745 2018-03-06 17:20:29 와아 인싸 오졌다리~
3746 2018-03-06 17:20:24 I came to this one place for my oil change and it was like a bit pricey but let me tell you. That customer service tho rn i don’t even care I wasted $81 on this lol
3747 2018-03-06 17:20:23 While I agree, sweetened palm oil is better than traditional shortening, it still makes me quite guilty to eat one.
3748 2018-03-06 17:20:17 it's run by anti-EPA Pruitt from ignorant oil rich Oklahoma.
3749 2018-03-06 17:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3750 2018-03-06 17:19:51 I think putting coconut oil on your eyebrows and leave it a few hours can help!
3751 2018-03-06 17:19:51 Vitamin E supplements and Olive Oil being massaged will help with eyebrow growth! Make sure it’s slightly warmed olive oil, 5 minutes!
3752 2018-03-06 17:19:35 i know my car is american made because it eats up so much oil
3753 2018-03-06 17:19:33 EIA: 2018 World Oil Demand Growth Forecast Cut By 30K Bpd, Seen At 1.70M Bpd (YoY) Increase.

US Crude Oil Production 2018 Seen Rising 1.38M Bpd (Increased Vs 1.26M Bpd Previously)
3754 2018-03-06 17:19:27 So a police woman aka a bleeder buys cannabis oil.
F@#*ing hypocrite???
3755 2018-03-06 17:19:20 the pepp oil spilt all over my room
3756 2018-03-06 17:19:12 Next two oil changes and cabin air filter replacement will be free, I guess that’ll make up for the damn headache of my car breaking down and the anxiety of not knowing what was wrong

3758 2018-03-06 17:18:48 He is just a snake oil salesman operating outside of the circus
3759 2018-03-06 17:18:38 Dear bald eagle. Thank you for letting us use you as the nation symbol. So sorry but your time is up. Americans kicked you to the curb and choose a trucker hat to be the symbol. They will sell your hunting grounds for oil companies. Best wishes, the World
3760 2018-03-06 17:18:32 Agreed. In fact, I instinctively suspect anything pro-climate oil businesses say. Need to see concrete action, which is why I'm surprised at some of Shell's recent moves.
3761 2018-03-06 17:18:31 the only thing that is keeping my sanity in control is watching gossip girl
3762 2018-03-06 17:18:28 Well now with the war on gas and oil UK could start producing more. And yeah Saudi oil tried to destroy western markets did a good job in the US. After 911 we’ve increased our output 10 fold
3763 2018-03-06 17:18:25 That oil your talking about, in those specific areas is largely unharvestable, will require more energy input to extract than it produces, and will permanently destroy ecosystems, watershed, ancient artifacts and Native American lands and homes. This is not yours to destroy.
3764 2018-03-06 17:18:14 موفقه 
3765 2018-03-06 17:18:09 chickens olive oil tractors and lemons wasn't enough now stealing sugar?
3766 2018-03-06 17:17:59 Had a dream I won free oil changes for life from @Pennzoil  Must be from winning the $50 Visa card from the last sweepstakes, thank you! My car only has been to 1 oil change place and I only use Pennzoil #synthetic #CustomerForLife
3767 2018-03-06 17:17:54 Logic and Liberal Feminists are like Oil and Water .
3768 2018-03-06 17:17:50 Kenney wants to nationalize the oil patch.

What do you think @Suncor @encana @enbridgegas @talismanenergy @HuskyEnergy @syncrude @irvingoil
3769 2018-03-06 17:17:48 Think of all those refunds though (our share of existing systems etc). Oh and the new oil. Oh And, off course we would not be contributing to transpirt systems down south...or refurbishing Buck House ...or Houses of parliament...and LOADS more. Hey, they might owe us money..!!
3770 2018-03-06 17:17:45 oil change and new tire 
3771 2018-03-06 17:17:42 its 915 i smoked a gram of oil send someone to my house please
3772 2018-03-06 17:17:34 Coconut oil 
3773 2018-03-06 17:17:32 It’s hydrating but keeps your oil at bay and it doesn’t look cakey.... I need to buy a new bottle bc I miss it
3774 2018-03-06 17:17:21 Getting oil change for the Cooper. Sitting in the waiting area, this woman pulled up in a Nissan full of bullet holes. Oh Baltimore
3775 2018-03-06 17:17:14 Castor oil.
3776 2018-03-06 17:17:02 What was MS on about? If you want to celebrate Sam Houston and Davy Crockett, fine with me. The Alamo, though, is one more myth about how great Texans think they are. Without oil, Texas would be the Clampetts before Jed missed that shot.
3777 2018-03-06 17:16:58 It might be bc they're non-porous but I never liked it tbh. Acrylic is porous so it might absorb ur body's oil and cause irritation at first but I find them more comfortable
3778 2018-03-06 17:16:55 So interesting to hear Saudi Aramco say that. Suspect their R&D will focus on trying to make oil acceptable tho, like their crazy idea for a CCS car, whereas Shell can manoeuvre into electrification @AmyAHarder
3779 2018-03-06 17:16:44 baby oil!
3780 2018-03-06 17:16:40 I recommend massaging your scalp with coconut oil to treat damaged hair / protect your thoughts from telepaths / have the shiniest head on the block.
3781 2018-03-06 17:16:32 Occam's Razor: Trump never considered Romney, met with him in order to openly reject and humiliate him. Of course Russia would object to Romney, no need to iterate that. Rex was selected for oil biz connects. Russians claim influence over POTUS.
3782 2018-03-06 17:16:21 If only we could harness all the talk in Jamaica into a energy form we would have no need to import oil. Kmt
3783 2018-03-06 17:16:18 Yessir y’all motor oil eating bastards
3784 2018-03-06 17:16:12 I've recently learned about palm oil but it's ubiquitous. Large companies have literally wiped out the habitat of these animals ...they're  homeless. Since 1999, the orangutan pop. has HALVED, due to palm oil.  We are just destroying this planet and the lives of innocents
3785 2018-03-06 17:16:11 more thoughts re latest: Chinese steel was used in some of the oil pipelines in the US too from memory. environmental sabotage? Q #567502 'wait for china/Russia reports'. wonder what companies supplied?
3786 2018-03-06 17:16:02 Gives it to us raw and drrrrenched in oil. You keeps nasty olives. #greeksalad
3787 2018-03-06 17:16:01 Despite having the largest oil reserves and cheapest petrol price in the whole world, they have to pay like 90 in their own currency for 1 litre of petrol???
3788 2018-03-06 17:15:56 Lol ffs did I not just read last week about enough oil for 120odd year's or something lol
3789 2018-03-06 17:15:54 Never met an Oil man unwilling to spend OPM.
3790 2018-03-06 17:15:50 We should keep all the oil though, they assure us they don’t want it.
3791 2018-03-06 17:15:46 Hai  Nak tanya, yang body shop tea tree oil punya range bagus tak? I have acne prone skin and tengah pakai proactiv but the downside for this product is dia terlalu mahal and cuma boleh beli online je. I'm trying to find cheaper options.
3792 2018-03-06 17:15:36 Oil can really bring out the best in titties

3794 2018-03-06 17:15:21 I like hot chili oil at Asian restaurants so I'm fine
3795 2018-03-06 17:15:18 Yes girl I tell her that all the time her hair is beautiful. I'm going to give the caster oil a try. My lashes are pretty long already but I want them longer! Lol
3796 2018-03-06 17:15:16 Both those suggestions are entirely untested.

Get the hydration and slow fermentation right though and whatever you make will be at the very least all right and quite possibly spectacular.

In general, wetter is better, so oil or wet your worktop when folding. Don’t add flour
3797 2018-03-06 17:15:15 Nigga turned into the strongest nigga alive wit that oil in him 
3798 2018-03-06 17:15:10 You could definitely have a little paprika with chocolate 'hummus', but not olive oil.
3799 2018-03-06 17:15:07 me: buying some baby oil
also me:  apologize
3800 2018-03-06 17:15:06 I think you can do this to whiten your teeth as well- coconut oil and baking soda.
3801 2018-03-06 17:15:01 Update: the Colo. Dept of Oil & Public Safety says this is the first fatality at a Colorado amusement park in a decade that didn’t involve a previous health condition
3802 2018-03-06 17:14:57 Poor guy, someone thought they were being kind in giving him a coffee instead of oil. Poor C-3PIO  RIP   RustInPeace
3803 2018-03-06 17:14:56 Given John’s love for NASCAR I believe his jacket would be either STP Oil Products or NAPA Auto Parts...
3804 2018-03-06 17:14:48 vitamin E oil
3805 2018-03-06 17:14:33 Maybe @LeoDiCaprio and @Janefonda can help you use oil to protest and be self righteous
3806 2018-03-06 17:14:32 Vietnam...Iraq...if you don’t think those are stupid then I have snake oil to sell you...hope your kids don’t end up in Korea 2.0, bye

3818 2018-03-06 17:13:43 You've been brainwashed. American businesses and consumers deserve the right to buy steel from the lowest cost producers. That's how the free market works. Do you want him to impose 25% tariffs on foreign oil too? Get a clue. You are being screwed.

3822 2018-03-06 17:13:29 @Google_MyStyle Page 361 and 362 of the 2018 Jeep Renegade Owner's Manual state that oil level should be checked at frequent intervals to ensure proper engine lubrication. The manual also states that new vehicles may initially burn oil. ^RR
3823 2018-03-06 17:13:20 Looks bland.... and too much oil
3824 2018-03-06 17:13:03 Yes, I know @ megaplex if you get it without the “butter” they put on behind the counter it’s fine. And they have self serve “butter” that is rlly canola oil!

3827 2018-03-06 17:12:36 EIA reduces 2017 oil demand growth to 1.70mbpd from 1.73mbpd, raises NON-OPEC supply growth to 2.51mbpd fr 2.35mbpd #OOTT
3828 2018-03-06 17:12:30 Because they have the OIL
3829 2018-03-06 17:12:28 Of course it is it's a fossil fuel along with oil.
3830 2018-03-06 17:12:18 เห็นมิกซ์เชียร์อัพพี่หมีแล้วจะร้อง กอดๆๆนะ โอ๋ๆ  #itcitybacon
3831 2018-03-06 17:12:15 $850? Shiiiiit I’ll oil these thangs up.
3832 2018-03-06 17:11:54 So while people are slamming Alberta's oil sands and carbon taxes.....did you know people in New Hampshire find recycling an inconvenience and chuck pop bottles etc. in their garbage? We can do better on the environment without taxes. Recycling is simple.
3833 2018-03-06 17:11:51 Trying jojoba oil for the first time #Claflin_RYS18
3834 2018-03-06 17:11:48 Well I've seen the fracing full bore at its highest possible rate in Canada and within 5 yrs streams went from nice to oil around the edges and now seismic activity to the point it's slows everything right down. So go ahead crank up the fracing merica won't be anyhing left soon
3835 2018-03-06 17:11:34 Have no fear, we’re here to help! DM us if you’d like to try H&S Dry Scalp Care with almond oil to help soothe and moisturize your scalp.
3836 2018-03-06 17:11:27 US EIA trims forecast for world oil demand growth this year EIA on oil demand
- The EIA cuts the 2018 demand growth forecast by 30,000 barrels per day
- Leaves 2019 demand growth unchanged at +1.72mbpd y/y
That's a marginal change.
3837 2018-03-06 17:11:25 Still would rather have it than coal, natural gas, and oil (people keep referring to the “moral case for oil” and I’m wondering wtf they’re talking about); but solar and wind are better solutions which actually have ecological values embedded in them.
3838 2018-03-06 17:11:23 kak mai kita try pakai oil cleanser tau. Tiny bumps boleh la hilang tp jerawat besar2 pulak tumbuh. Ke tu sbb hormone?
3839 2018-03-06 17:11:23 There is no such thing as fossil fuels.  Oil and gas are abiotic - they replenish themselves over time.  See Permean Basin.  The Guy who created this place made sure of that.
3840 2018-03-06 17:11:13 This transformation is from oil to natural gas cause there is more of it than oil
3841 2018-03-06 17:11:02 If you can't eat it with olive oil and a little paprika is it really hummus?
3842 2018-03-06 17:10:37 Oh good god. Is this for raping Bears Ears for oil and gas profits?
3843 2018-03-06 17:10:35 Mature Oil, Natural Gas Resources Still Have Life (Reserves) in Them, Says Rystad
3844 2018-03-06 17:10:29 Yes you do!  Pics please.  Bet you could sell them too!
3845 2018-03-06 17:10:23 Of course not. His bases are covered. A wise investor invests for the long term. Short term losses are expected and accepted. Even long term ones when it comes to pro sports franchise owners because they're not dumb enough to sink all their cash into the team. #portfolio
3846 2018-03-06 17:10:22 Still using petrol products to protest oil eh?
3847 2018-03-06 17:10:22 …ｽﾔｽﾔ

3849 2018-03-06 17:10:18 But we wouldn't have grapeseed oil
3850 2018-03-06 17:10:09 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
3851 2018-03-06 17:10:01 Oil production is a small segment of the working class, idiot!

What about the rest of us? Your tariff will cost jobs.
3852 2018-03-06 17:10:00 This wall St analyst r saying about oil since all the majors r in a middle of a great change that is taking place now and it has to do with black gold
3853 2018-03-06 17:09:58 Two completely different arguments. Agree on aid, disagree on oil.
3854 2018-03-06 17:09:54 I guess people think gas and oil changes are free 
3855 2018-03-06 17:09:54 Rebecca’s grams rubbed her special Vietnamese oil on my head to heal it and it still hurts and I smell like a mixture of baby oil and men’s cologne 
3856 2018-03-06 17:09:46 No.
USA took the power on oil from Great Britain at end of WW II 1945.
Look at borders on Arab peninsula. Who drew them?
3857 2018-03-06 17:09:34 The only people that would be hurt by Alberta blocking oil into BC would be the shareholders of Kinder Morgan. BC would have fuel from Washington within a week, prices would not increase more than $.02 / ltr
3858 2018-03-06 17:09:21 True. They'll want what they wanted last time. Food, oil and no regime change.
3859 2018-03-06 17:09:20 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
3860 2018-03-06 17:08:59 The future is renewable sources of energy, NOT oil.
Do you ever think about the future for your grandchildren's generation?
3861 2018-03-06 17:08:57 All I’m saying is let me see somebody in colors that aren’t crimson and cream get chicken/oil before us and we beating your ass. -management (me and vinny)
3862 2018-03-06 17:08:55 My kink is hanging up fresh oil paintings on the wall to dry
3863 2018-03-06 17:08:54 McDonald's flips to fresh beef in 3,500 U.S. restaurants: Now if they will eliminate the silicone additive in their fryer oil I might go back. @nbcnews
3864 2018-03-06 17:08:52 It’s sad that god gave up a planet big enough to home all living things and instead of appreciating the fact that he did and sharing what we have to balance everything,we go at war with our brothers and sisters over paper and oil. This planet will surely survive,just not humanity
3865 2018-03-06 17:08:47 Where have you been this last year?  We’ll be lucky if they’re not drilling for oil off our shores!
3866 2018-03-06 17:08:42 Nikola Tesla had envisioned a world of free electricity, which included aircraft powered by generators, not jet engines.  Had he had the funding to continue where would the world be now?  Using free electricity?  Or paying for oil products?
3867 2018-03-06 17:08:30 I will never ever eat @NutellaGlobal again till they take real responsibilities and make official programs to conserve the species (like orangutans) that have been killed because of the deforestation to obtain your so needed palm oil
3868 2018-03-06 17:08:30 Who believed that  I certainly didn't!  I don't know about you Sire? But is that the point here?  We should believe bullet trains fallacy because some buffoons believed oil from rocks? What's your point.
3869 2018-03-06 17:08:16 This government is just so corrupt chasing the money from the oil and gas industry at the expense of the people, the landscape and the planet.  They are despicable people
3870 2018-03-06 17:08:15 Peppermint oil on your temples and wrists! Also, if you an find a reputable place nearby, acupuncture.
3871 2018-03-06 17:08:06 As @DanielYergin notes high number of attendees for #CERAWeek, the CEO of @conocophillips notes that it helps when there is "a 6 in front of the oil price instead of a 4"
3872 2018-03-06 17:08:04 I agree, to much money! maybe gas and oil could share the burden since they use our roads and resources. but you're not really a West Virginian, are you, troll?
3873 2018-03-06 17:08:03 Largest oil producer? From where ? From all the oil that you gringos have taken, stole , invade and murder from other country’s 
3874 2018-03-06 17:07:49 where tf do i get sunflower oil???? i hate my acne marks sigh
3875 2018-03-06 17:07:44 @HammerNation19 @EasyENation @TheRealTRizzo Did Rizz just say that you can't eat bass? Bass are definitely catch and release. I catch them, release them into hot oil, after breading them. Great eating!
3876 2018-03-06 17:07:38 Doing a twist out once a week , and just wearing my curls, and not combing my hair really has it growing  plus i oil it once a week but gosh it’s nice 
3877 2018-03-06 17:07:34 United States of America is now the number one oil producing country in the world.Just great with oil prices low and the rest of the world transitioning to clean fuels  Oil and coal are not the future! To lead the world we must look Ahead. Trump and his ilk are the past

3880 2018-03-06 17:07:17 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.

3882 2018-03-06 17:07:06 Two comments.  1) they're in last place. Without the talent, promise, drama in Edm.  Of course you won't draw.  2) Baker need not make money, but Oil will correlate loss to tangible value they believe they gain from location, as well as cost of other options, as best they can.
3883 2018-03-06 17:06:59 How can you be neutral when its a never-ending train-wreck? The staff turnover. The indictments. The $1.5 Trillion added debt, coal waste in rivers, monument reduction for oil, off-shore drilling, Puerto Rico, no sanctions, the steel tariff, climate change. WTF has Trump done?
3884 2018-03-06 17:06:39 Oh because that’s what they called na
3885 2018-03-06 17:06:37 Clean oil is good oil, every time you transfer oil unfiltered it becomes 2 times dirtier.
3886 2018-03-06 17:06:28 Natural gas and oil should magically fly from deep in the earth to the refinery, then to your home or vehicle all by itself.
3887 2018-03-06 17:06:27 And oil is good for the environment?
You are also the best at school shootings. Get my point?
3888 2018-03-06 17:06:25 love coconut  oil for my hair, nails & body but it goes nowhere near my face 
3889 2018-03-06 17:06:11 Pay 4 play, Russia picked Tillerson because of Exxon’s oil deal that He orchestrated. Look what’s not happening at State?
3890 2018-03-06 17:06:07 Can someone bring me peppermint oil? Id be so grateful 
3891 2018-03-06 17:06:02 wow, not sure how you got racism out of oil and water, but i guess everything is racist nowadays, wait... do you hate oil because it's black... haha
3892 2018-03-06 17:05:54 Bud or oil, depending on the device you get. But I get the oil at a bodega. I don't trust it because of that reason. But there's other plugs with better quality. I recommend oil because it last me more than two weeks for 35-40.
3893 2018-03-06 17:05:38 Oil money... Russia... much George?
3894 2018-03-06 17:05:35 The discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia and the rise of the United States as a world power was crucial
3895 2018-03-06 17:05:35 Getting paid to sit around at Elk Grove customs because I’m waiting on my work truck to get an oil change. This is a great start to my morning

3897 2018-03-06 17:05:18 Too bad we sell all of this overseas mostly to Japan.   There is no betterment for consumers here. Only big oil will make more money by sending our oil out of country.
3898 2018-03-06 17:05:12 Anyone have any thoughts on CBD Oil as a natural supplement? Pain? Depression? Anxiety? Migraines? Etc... please share your experience.
3899 2018-03-06 17:05:10 Why don’t you put a 25% tariff  on oil if you have so much. Turn those Arab ships around. Almost forgot, Is the Keystone project finished?

3929 2018-03-06 17:02:06 You are fairly accurate in your statement. Erdogan mentored, fed, supplied, and transported ISIS fighters from all over the world into Syria to unseat Assad and build a Sunni majority government. Then he bought stolen Syrian oil and the cash was used for weapons and supplies.

3938 2018-03-06 17:01:46 Enjoy healthful fats. Fats from fish, nuts, seeds, avocados, olives and extra virgin olive oil, and coconut butter. These healthy fats help to reduce diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and dementia; lower cholesterol and triglycerides; and make your food tasty and satisfying.
3939 2018-03-06 17:01:38 Agree! Don't see anyone analyzing oil to predict customer behavior, do you?
3940 2018-03-06 17:01:31 I will try again.  The oil and the pipeline are PRIVATELY owned.  They decide who and where the product is sold.  This is called capitalism.  Kenny is claiming the gov (his fictional one) will decide to who the product is sold.  That is communism.
3941 2018-03-06 17:01:30 What is French for FO? This crap gets me angry, bit like Herald paid Torrance saying at a fringe meeting that the reason Norway makes so much from their oil is because they own it! Next day people were saying someone called him a 'balloon', I smiled quite proud of myself!
3942 2018-03-06 17:01:22 Trump's tariffs have the potential to decimate the economic progress he has made. Other countries know the U.S. intends to export significantly more oil. It would make sense for them to retaliate at the U.S. with oil tariffs and hit Trump where it will hurt most.
3943 2018-03-06 17:01:21 Not heard of it, I’ve always used bepanthen until the scabs form then coconut oil for something lighter that won’t pull so much

3958 2018-03-06 17:00:39 Heh don’t worry, I ate rice congee with furikake and sesame oil and a decaf coffee. It puts me to sleep. It is strange.
3959 2018-03-06 17:00:37 You honestly don't see the value in saving our oil and using everyone else's? I'm pretty conservative and that just makes sense. When you are one of the last ones holding a valued commodity, you can set the price.
3960 2018-03-06 17:00:28 This isn’t a surprise. How often have politicians duped people into thinking the snake oil they’re selling will work? That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t seek solutions that might lead to a stronger middle class. Especially if the protections of the social safety net are under attack.

3962 2018-03-06 17:00:24 The US Navy and Marine Corps have arrived in the Mediterranean amid tensions between Turkey, Greece and Cyprus over oil exploration.

3963 2018-03-06 17:00:20 And yet your very corrupt province continues to import oil from some of the dirtiest countries in the world and dump millions of liters of sewage into the waterways. Maybe you should keep your opinion to yourself until you clean up your own backyard.

3994 2018-03-06 16:57:52 If @JDRocks1839 price-fixes the oil ONE MORE TIME I'm gonna fix his face. 
3995 2018-03-06 16:57:47 Oh contraire, @RepJaredPolis s words are loaded with special interest. He fails to see the COGCC is ‘unfair and unbalanced’ it is arbitrary and capricious favoring oil and gas over human health.
3996 2018-03-06 16:57:39 Why would anybody want more oil rigs?? Specially at sea!! 

Stupid and unnecessary.
3997 2018-03-06 16:57:35 I've been wanting to try caster oil I heard it helps. But yes biotin pills, natural shampoos, and less heat makes a huge difference.

4002 2018-03-06 16:57:17 some people just want to see the world burn, this man just threw oil on it
4003 2018-03-06 16:57:13 I agree with you though, it will have to be a scaled process. We are thinking $12 by 2020, $16 by 2022 and $20 by 2024. By then we will need to readjust that $22 Mark most likely so we can approach what the minimum wage should be at that time. Oil companies don’t need subsidies.
4004 2018-03-06 16:57:04 The Constitution is clear , free education is what the Constitution and the fore fathers preach and recommend for any govt to work towards not using in as a revenue generating center. 
We have oil well,that should be enough to generate revenue not selling it out to friends.
4005 2018-03-06 16:56:54 Absolutely!!!! Took my nails 4 months to recover from 3  shellac’s  a couple of years ago. Lesson learnt - they were paper thin, bruised, kept splitting. Only ever do one at a time now maybe at Christmas but even then takes weeks to recover. Putting castor oil in then helps!

4009 2018-03-06 16:56:42 Last night I was cooking and the garlic smelled weirdly fruity so maybe Gloria Ramirez was just cooking and didn’t use enough oil

4011 2018-03-06 16:56:29 So who is going to be around to use the Oil when you have killed the environment to get it. Thanks for putting the planet at risk it is greatly appreciated, you jerk.
4012 2018-03-06 16:56:29 One of the challenges for me in this position is we’re part of the sales team.
My primary background is in Compliance and Risk.
That’s like mixing oil and water. I’m the enemy.
4013 2018-03-06 16:56:24 That’s typical for a first-time caught white collar felony. Especially if the felon is a #Democrat 
4014 2018-03-06 16:56:09 sadly palm oil is not vegan :/
4015 2018-03-06 16:56:06 Finally.... Baby oil? 
4016 2018-03-06 16:56:03 SAA should move into the vacated territory and maybe get their oil back plus block the Turkish advance or halt Turkey,s excuse its occupied by terrorist,s. US troops will be in an untenable position in Syria.
4017 2018-03-06 16:56:00 I just wanted an oil change .. that’s all
4018 2018-03-06 16:55:51 No need to extend the comment period. We need the oil to become self reliant.  Drill baby drill
4019 2018-03-06 16:55:44 Our cats ears are a little dirty.. I suspect he may have caught ear mites somewhere in his adventures.  We're opting for home remedy treatment mineral oil over any products specifically for his prob.  Cheaper and mineral oil is good to have around for alot of things :)
4020 2018-03-06 16:55:43 Yup. With goat cheez, olive oil, honey.
4021 2018-03-06 16:55:40 These communities sued Koch-backed Big Oil over climate change; then the backlash began
4022 2018-03-06 16:55:34 Not good if it falls on the backs of WV people. Tax the damn gas and oil; it's obvious!
4023 2018-03-06 16:55:32 Other countries will place tariffs on U.S. oil, thanks to you, Mr. President. It's going to cost the U.S. JOBS JOBS JOBS!
4024 2018-03-06 16:55:28 Dumbest thing I've heard today. Venezuela is where they are because their primary product is oil. Corruption and criminal conglomerates destroyed the country. Not socialism. Read a book. Learn, don't regurgitate Fox drivel.
4025 2018-03-06 16:54:58 Gun violence from Iraq yeah I lost my fiance to cancer when the hospital in Greece was closed down because engaged to oil from Iraq to have electricity to run the island of Crete

4027 2018-03-06 16:54:41 "The existence of large deposits of oil, natural gas, diamonds, gold, uranium along with other strategic minerals and waterways underline the real interests of Washington and Wall Street." Of course.
4028 2018-03-06 16:54:15 How precious...another liberal thinking his an 'expert' on the NRA and probably guns also.
4029 2018-03-06 16:54:11 #MustardOil is definitely one of the prettiest among other types of #CookingOil. Its vibrant golden colour is a far cry from the insipid pale yellow colour of other oils, especially refined oil. I keep my #Mustard Oil in an ornamental glass jar - it's that pretty!
4030 2018-03-06 16:54:00 Reality tv stars, Russian oil puppet, i mean president.
4031 2018-03-06 16:54:00 U.S. crude production is expected to reach a record of 12.1 million barrels a day in 2023, up from 10.6 million a day this year. American oil output will surge past Russia, currently the world’s largest crude producer at roughly 11 million barrels a day.
4032 2018-03-06 16:53:59 Good luck replacing teachers, Genius; we cannot even fill 700 current vacancies because the overall state conditions are so poor. There are benefits to investing in our people and our state. Raise gas and oil tax, maybe?
4033 2018-03-06 16:53:57 Oil is like the center position in the NBA, something that was valuable in the past, but no longer used today.
4034 2018-03-06 16:53:50 La premisa —que el PRI es el causante y origen de todos nuestros males— es demasiado simplista. Que esté adornada de apellidos en francés no la hace más inteligente.
4035 2018-03-06 16:53:50 The little weed vape pen thingys just ain’t for me lmaoo I finished the oil in 2 secs .
4036 2018-03-06 16:53:48 I'm taking the rest of the day off, too risky, made daily goal barely. 
SPX 1H accumulating below 50/200MAs. OIL 15M finding bottom to set up bullish. NATGAS 15M tests 2.705 supt 2.75 resist. GOLD 15M totally over extended higher. USD 1H slowly capitulating lower, 2nd leg down.
4037 2018-03-06 16:53:47 yeah there is totally rapeseed oil in this stuff, albeit 2%. but I don't think it counts as davar hamamid.
4038 2018-03-06 16:53:45 Thank you for promising to stop oil to BC, it means a lot to have you on the anti TMP side. I'll admit I didn't see this coming.

4043 2018-03-06 16:53:13 I got a new refrigerator, and it arrived Sunday. The sticker on the front is stuck on there like it is waiting for the apocalypse. That sounds like a cool project. I only need enough for this. Hope the oil trick from wiki-how works.

4045 2018-03-06 16:53:12 Burning the midnight oil to follow your dreams, can be a tough road. Seeking change at 42, has been character building. One thing I know is that I'm looking forward to my first big salesforce event Snowforce, to get recharged and refocused. See you all there.

4050 2018-03-06 16:52:35 sir, an idea: since we may very well become the world's largest oil producer; let's join opec, assume the largest chair & dictate all terms, organize it as we wish, then systematically disband it. wow! energy dependent countries (e.g. china) wud be neutralized & our deficit-"0".
4051 2018-03-06 16:52:31 These is critical gears grinding. Oil light’s on.
4052 2018-03-06 16:52:28 Wait your oil change is covered?! I thought it would be but I was told it’s not and I’ve had to do all my oil changes, tire rotations, but new tires, etc. I think it’s dumb because I’m leasing so shouldn’t they do that?? This is my first and I don’t mind my car and
4053 2018-03-06 16:52:26 Other things that help. You want to shave twice, first with the grain, then against. The other big tip is to buy some shaving oil. It reduces razor burn and helps the razor glide over your face better.

4062 2018-03-06 16:51:28 And Obama did not shrink National Park Lands, infringe on native lands, and take away protections for oil & gas exploration, either. But, to each his own, these probably don’t matter to you, anyway.

4066 2018-03-06 16:51:13 Inevitable really, once Exxon publicly announced the death of the Rosneft Arctic Sea oil development deal. That was the money shot, and they screwed it up.
4067 2018-03-06 16:51:13 This is my second 3 year lease. A 2018 Toyota Corolla SE (last time I got the S), pro would be that any maintenance/oil change is covered for the first two years, con is the down payment (I did a higher down payment so my monthly is less)
4068 2018-03-06 16:51:10 Looks more like Saudi Arabia propaganda. Fracking is killing their oil sales.
4069 2018-03-06 16:51:06 So then BC would do like eastern provinces and get oil elsewhere which would be lost revenue for Alberta oil companies. smart indeed or just full of shit talk to get base going mmmm

4073 2018-03-06 16:50:49 But Sir, non-commodity African countries like Ghana, Ethiopia, Rwanda—have an ingenious GDP growth over the years that is sustainable as against Nigeria & Angola which strives on oil. It’s a bubble that was going to burst someday.

4078 2018-03-06 16:50:12 When I was 20, I was a steelworker, USWA Local 1188. We made hand tools and also large tools and chain wrenches for the oil industry. Jimmy Carter's foreign policy failure in Iran cost us a major customer. His trade policies then cost us all our livelihoods ..
4079 2018-03-06 16:50:00 When cleaning up oil, why is 10,000 parts per million of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons considered “clean”? Learn how this became the standard.

4081 2018-03-06 16:49:49 oil looks exactly like last week, rally till 9AM Tuesday and loose 5% by next afternoon

4090 2018-03-06 16:49:06 Oil will be useless in less than 20 years. F Saudi Arabia F their IPO.

4097 2018-03-06 16:48:36 As I’ve said before if we didn’t have oil we would have been independent years ago
4098 2018-03-06 16:48:33 water, tea and bio oil can fix almost anything
4099 2018-03-06 16:48:29 put tea tree oil on it
4100 2018-03-06 16:48:24 One time my mom lied about a dream she had so I couldn't go out. Sooo the two weeks go by I lied and said I had to get out of a family function. I had to sleep with holy oil on my forehead for a week.
4101 2018-03-06 16:48:24 A national energy plan should include the we stop importing foreign oil and become energy self sufficient.
4102 2018-03-06 16:48:13 Might as well be the world leader in VHS production. There are more efficient and sustainable fuel sources that will create more jobs than oil and coal combined.
4103 2018-03-06 16:47:59 I scheduled an oil change so I can go to a con out of town this weekend. I still have no one to let out the pups...hmm
4104 2018-03-06 16:47:57 Garlic olive oil and tomatoes would go perfect with that ....

4116 2018-03-06 16:46:27 I’m having war flashbacks. Mellos had to ride the tuba/perc bus to Lucas oil and someone played Hard in Da Paint through the bus speakers. Everyone was shook when I knew all the fuckin words. I miss that.

4118 2018-03-06 16:46:20 If it's a non-stick pan remember to always wash it with soap after use. The mix of butter (or fat), together with water (which they often put in food) and high heat, you'll create a coating which is very hard to get off, even with soap. So use oil as often as you can preferably.

4132 2018-03-06 16:45:22 Oil industry should be at the bottom of the list of priorities. I agree with you that healthcare and education should be at the top the list. This just shows how stupid the Prime minister can be when making decisions for the country. Agree?
4133 2018-03-06 16:44:55 We have to work together for the good if the Mexican Spanish allies or we fail and women and children get hurt also and the big theory is2 negotiate better than oil but more food seed and growth to add is not 2conquer but settle with adding together what we can do 4our country's
4134 2018-03-06 16:44:48 Seismic exploration and oil drilling has become such a political topic with each president reversing what the previous president did instead of thinking about what is best for our future and the future of our planet

1. Mexico trade deficits
2. Identifying stainless steel and aluminum was strategic metals for roads, bridges and defense
3. Supporting mining of rare metals, lithium and vanadium
4. Getting oil to market
4157 2018-03-06 16:42:22 The Standard Oil Company dominates each part of the oil industry. We WILL take them down. #Exposed
4158 2018-03-06 16:42:21 All Muslim rulers are autocrats, Monarchies & oppressors. Iraq's annual oil income was some $50 billions, population 22 millions. Any system that does not brings prosperity to the people, parishes

4160 2018-03-06 16:41:55 "the most important way to increase oil and gas investment in Canada is to get a better price for our oil and gas" @Bill_Morneau at @BizCouncilBC breakfast. #Pipelines #TransMountain #bcpoli
4161 2018-03-06 16:41:55 Contrary to what you might think, that's not how that works. Any venture they take on is to make money.
4162 2018-03-06 16:41:53 Point out exactly where the original translations say 300,000 years? Or any amount of years? But this is the age of post-truth. So yes, I do believe that the earth was formed by the fart of a she goat into the void and that cancer can be cured by medimix soap and axe oil.
4163 2018-03-06 16:41:35 “Data is like oil. It’s crude. It’s the quality of the refining process that determines its usefulness” - Rose Lukin #digifest18
4164 2018-03-06 16:41:27 For the dye-zeolite L compound (PTM=silicon oil) no phase transition was found by my colleagues (I trust them deeply:-)), which is reasonable IMO.
For water/EtOH in FER, they observed a phase transition from orthorhombic Pmnn to monoclinic P21/n at about 1GPa.
4165 2018-03-06 16:41:27 Single biggest factor to getting Cdn. oil and gas to market is investment - Morneau says, to claps from audience

4178 2018-03-06 16:40:31 US gun runners created the Korean War to take oil out. (Still using it to sell missles) The US needs to shut up and let them make peace.
4179 2018-03-06 16:40:21 We're supposed  to be reducing our dependacy on oil, reduce CO2 emissions. Scotland is racing ahead with renewable/green energy. Maybe time to leave the oil in the ground. Norway?
4180 2018-03-06 16:40:14 Do all cars in California run on the Hot Air that comes out California politicians? If not, you need an oil rig. Reality isn't that hard.
4181 2018-03-06 16:40:14 The US has enough oil production today to serve our needs, however we allow oil companies to export our reserves even though they drilled, sometimes for pennies or free, on public lands that belong to all of us. Offshore drilling isn't needed right now. #DEEPWATERHORIZON

4183 2018-03-06 16:40:12 Sugar, palm and/or canola oil, high fructose corn syrup, soy lecithin, and artificial flavor. When you bubble hydrogen through a vegetable oil to make it more solid, it becomes just as bad for your arteries as animal fat.
4184 2018-03-06 16:40:00 Got an oil change, cleaned the car now me and Mateo are getting ready to treat ourselves to food with daddy's card 
4185 2018-03-06 16:39:52 The back of my hand is literally peeling and lotion/ oil isn’t helping it 
4186 2018-03-06 16:39:51 I just got peppermint oil in my eye. Will someone please come put me out of my misery.
4187 2018-03-06 16:39:50 100% and not disagreeing with you but coaches are sometimes put in a tough spot.
4188 2018-03-06 16:39:48 #Cheshire : Traffic Officers continue to work hard on the #M6 southbound within the roadworks J17 - J16, following a HGV oil spillage across 100 yards of road surface.  Two lanes open, but expect delays.

4190 2018-03-06 16:39:34 Didn't think available in TX, but it is!!! No THC in it. I'm amazed at the relief from it!!! Been on hydrocodone for over 20yrs! Don't use daily, but have it if needed. Then only use 1/2. The CBD oil actually gives me more relief than the RX drugs! Nuts!!!

4203 2018-03-06 16:37:48 King county is dumping 50 million gal of raw sewage daily into Puget Sound, cries about  effect of oil drilling. @toddeherman @rushlimbaugh
4204 2018-03-06 16:37:41 Lee, you missed the worst aspect of that article!!! They just confirmed to their readers that oil will be around for decades before it is supplanted by clean energy. Reality: it will be gone in 5 to 8 years due to exponentially accelerating progress. Gotta continue investment!!!!

4210 2018-03-06 16:37:01 The oil recession was made up by Westminster we hardly heard any other country go on about it,Scotland stand up and grow a backbone
4211 2018-03-06 16:36:56 I'll always be here for you, since we spent the night photographing oil rigs badly.

4215 2018-03-06 16:36:23 The green hysterics will not budge - they would rather buy American oil/gas products at a premium price.  Unlike BC, Alberta is an energy powerhouse.  While you are at it - don't sign any deal for electricity from Site C.
4216 2018-03-06 16:36:17 Why is the possibility of dumping hundreds of barrels of oil on our coastline making our country strong.  Making our country strong would be moving towards sun and wind power, not dependent on oil.

4221 2018-03-06 16:35:49 During #indyref SNP said "Oil is a bonus!"—turned out it was the basis of their fiscal plan. "It's Oor Pound!"—no currency union, no plan for LoLR, central reservers. "EU advice, in terms of the debate!"—we'd have been out of EU, despite SNP insisting otherwise.
4222 2018-03-06 16:35:41 Not a scientist but I do know that we can't cherry pick what we get from a barrel of crude oil. We can tinker with the chemistry to increase the yield of "nice" aromatics but the "nasty" middle distillates and residues will always be about two thirds. 1.
4223 2018-03-06 16:35:40 NOOOOO!!!!!  If you want to call it "security," we would save our oil for when we need it and everyone else's (countries) oil is gone.  The root word of conservative is CONSERVE!!!  Interesting tweet for someone who has a vested interest in the oil industry.

4230 2018-03-06 16:35:12 Still baffles me that there is a cannabis oil which is EVIDENTLY proving to cure epilepsy on ppl which is legal in Spain etc but they won’t legalise it here when it is FUCKING CURING PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
4231 2018-03-06 16:35:11 .. Regarding to the media used for fluorenone dye-zeolite L, it was silicon oil: we decided for a non-penetrating fluid because we were interested to the response of the already-prepared dye-zeolite L system, so if the dye geometry were distorted by compression. It didn't happen.
4232 2018-03-06 16:35:11 Them: “You just need to eat healthier.”

4233 2018-03-06 16:35:02 AB loses $7.2B every year because we can’t get our oil to tidewater. Think about that and what that money could do for all of Canada, including paying for environmental issues. #cdnpoli
4234 2018-03-06 16:34:54 M6 : 1 lane closed southbound between J17, Sandbach and J16, Crewe, oil spillage, long delays
4235 2018-03-06 16:34:54 That’s a basaltic scoria or pumice, it absorbs oil because of the pores left by degassing - as the lava rapidly goes from deep to the surface, the gas comes out of solution in the melt - the bigger the holes, the more quickly it came up #geologist
4236 2018-03-06 16:34:53 I looks to me that American is owned, we gave our country away bit by bit to industry, oil, banking an now to our enemies.
4237 2018-03-06 16:34:45 My hungry ass thought i was hearing my dad making some eggs , bc you know the sound of the egg cooking in oil ? Well yea, I get up to see no eggs being made , but noise coming from my toilet 
4238 2018-03-06 16:34:36 @SamueleMarcora Come si dice "snake oil" in Italiano?
4239 2018-03-06 16:34:33 Just curious, where exactly is that oil coming from?  What part of our country are you going to destroy?  Asking for a few million of my closest friends.

4247 2018-03-06 16:33:39 data is the new oil jako paliwo z którego można zrobić wiele innych produktów. Z kolei o tyle jest różnica iż dane mogą być użyte wielokrotnie.

4262 2018-03-06 16:32:27 I agree. Politicians don't need to sacrifice free trade but it would help if they even pretended to care about economic displacement and people's real insecurities. 

Trump promised them snake oil but he pretended to care. That's all it took.
4263 2018-03-06 16:32:05 Getting my oil changed at a place like Big O Tires always make me laugh.. like I know my car’s hella old but they try to sell me on a fix/replace/change/flush or literally ANYTHING.

4268 2018-03-06 16:31:17 Come on, Ms. Jebreal, you stole that from the Trump Campaign Strategy Paper, didn't you.

There is a common immoral philosophy that, sadly, works no matter if the Snake Oil Salesman is ObL, Trump or Alinsky. It peppers all of human history.
4269 2018-03-06 16:31:16 I need a oil change and a car wash .

4284 2018-03-06 16:29:44 I am looking in the owners manual for this Jeep Renegade and it says nothing specific about "This vehicle burns oil and will shut down if you don't have it changed in scheduled time". You sold us this death trap. We were almost killed.
4285 2018-03-06 16:29:36 I noticed there was Palm oil in dog&cat food & their treats too. Palm oil is sneaky, hiding everywhere! BEWARE.  do NOT buy it!
4286 2018-03-06 16:29:34 Oh yeah. Eventually, he and his dad bought a whole block, subdivided it, built houses on some lots and sold some as unimproved. While working for a small oil co here in CA, he took part of his pay in co stock. After he retired, that co was bought by Standard oil, now Chevron
4287 2018-03-06 16:29:32 Lol! Here we go yet again. I wish you would report that Scotland is a wealthy country even with no oil

4289 2018-03-06 16:29:17 "I don’t have enough oil to give you." - @emmykegler on @queerologypod // Sometimes you cannot keep giving other people your oil (resources), they have to do your own work. On the flipside, you can’t expect everyone else’s to make up for your shortfalls. So good!
4290 2018-03-06 16:29:15 The 10  virgins

Only 5 had extra vessel of oil.
Lamp = bible / word of God
Oil = anticipation
Groom = Jesus' 2nd coming
Wedding place = above & over the firmament / God's dwelling place
4291 2018-03-06 16:29:14 "data is the new oil"
4292 2018-03-06 16:29:09 Our Captain is stealing oil. Poor Maldives
4293 2018-03-06 16:29:04 Modern day tools of the micro war against Americans: 1. Bar Exam Monopoly, 2. Coffee, 3. Milk, 4. Polyester. Polyester is plastic and oil based. 5. Oil burner & auto polution which stay in our local areas.
4294 2018-03-06 16:29:02 Well on the bright side after this shitty weekend I got a brand new battery a fresh oil change and soon to be new cam plugs and spark plugs. Pampering the vtec until get rid of her
4295 2018-03-06 16:29:02 I am not surprised instead of helping 60% of his people who receive food aid or enter Uganda as refugees,  his tribalism and  greed exhausts the scarce oil funds....
4296 2018-03-06 16:29:01 Did you drop your brain in a oil rig?

4299 2018-03-06 16:28:46 Trump trying to sell off all of America's oil reserves !
4300 2018-03-06 16:28:37 Notice that Syria is directly to the right of Cyprus where the exploration will take place. And south is Lebanon another soon to be failed state.

Oil and gas majors love failed states, right Libya?
4301 2018-03-06 16:28:36 In the rural KZN, most cannot afford Coconut Oil. I worked last year at Khula Natural Health Clinic near St Lucia and suggested Beef drippings as a safe cooking oil.
4302 2018-03-06 16:28:15 Oil change goin take 2 hours 

So i came to the shop to cool it
4303 2018-03-06 16:28:08 The exact wording in the article is “Russia was presenting what it claimed to be proof of Turkey’s role in the Islamic State’s oil trade.”

4306 2018-03-06 16:27:59 Let me guess, Tillerson is prospecting for oil for Exxon.
4307 2018-03-06 16:27:53 If you actually want something for wisdom teeth clove oil works a treat 
4308 2018-03-06 16:27:50 Yes! RT @CoriumSkincare: We have the opportunity to source 100% pure Shea Nut Oil. It is the oil which is derived from the Karite Tree (Shea Butter Tree). It has a high concentration of Vitamin A, E & F, and provides moisture retention. 
Would you be interested in such an oil?
4309 2018-03-06 16:27:48 Harper took the Endangered Killer whales off our protection act, Stopped the scientist from their work, sold our grain to Saudi’s & put every penny into oil , Hmmm Let me Think 
4310 2018-03-06 16:27:46 It's Argan Oil
4311 2018-03-06 16:27:35 1. Wind turbines displace oil and coal and ease climate change instead of making it worse. Properly sited and practiced (e.g., not running in migratory paths during season), their effects are positive.
2. We also could have used rooftop solar as an example. No land loss there!
4312 2018-03-06 16:27:34 Oil industry employs CANADIANS from coast to coast to coast! Billions paid to Saudi for something WE HAVE.Any Canadian that thinks making thounds of our own unemployed and spending billions out of our country is pathetic.
4313 2018-03-06 16:27:27 Always use mustard oil, uske baad chahe jisko bhi karo.
4314 2018-03-06 16:27:22 You’re probably right but that just speaks to a bigger issue with the franchise.  They are one of the teams that actually owns there AHL team and has an owner that can afford to take in less of a profit from the AHL team.
4315 2018-03-06 16:27:21 なに一つ奇跡なんかじゃない。
4316 2018-03-06 16:27:20 this administration is such a spectacular shit show it’s taken us over a year to wonder why an oil executive with no diplomatic experience is our Secretary of State
4317 2018-03-06 16:27:16 Ah but I’d rather listen to them than the oil companies themselves - what do they know? We know the union is fracturing (or should that be fracking)!?
4318 2018-03-06 16:27:15 Maybe we should look at importing our Oil from Saudi Arabia to,like Eastern Canada they seem to be getting it cheaper than we do and no bullying
4319 2018-03-06 16:27:12 Ngakak inget oil jd inget....

4321 2018-03-06 16:27:02 @BrianLehrer,  I've become virtually vegan (& I don't eat vegan junk foods). I've also cut out virtually all oil.  My A1c (the measure of blood sugar) has dropped and is excellent.  In contrast, it is now routine for so many unsuspecting patients to be diagnosed with prediabetes.
4322 2018-03-06 16:27:02 used too much coconut oil and now i look like one of the sex scenes in “belly”. ama

4324 2018-03-06 16:26:41 Socialism has ALWAYS failed. Even when given every opportunity to thrive, it still fails. Oil rich Venezuela even manages to stuff it up.
4325 2018-03-06 16:26:41 So come talk to us in California regarding your plan to open our coast to oil drilling asshat. What, Livingston too close to your Whitefish neighborhood?Zinke is NO Teddy Roosevelt!

4330 2018-03-06 16:26:26 Why are oil changes the most ridiculous process?
4331 2018-03-06 16:26:23 Argan oil memang magis betul kalau letak kat rambut. Berkilat lawa mampus. Tapi tu la harga pun mahal mampus jugak.
4332 2018-03-06 16:26:23 The article says “Russia was presenting what it claimed to be proof of Turkey’s role in the Islamic State’s oil trade.”
4333 2018-03-06 16:26:21 The guru of Oil business from the US is coming to Nrbi. I hope governor Nanok will join the high table. Rex Tillerson, US envoy will be cutting deals with Jubilee. That’s why NASA is not featuring in the visit! @RailaOdinga @skmusyoka @edwinsifuna @TheODMparty
4334 2018-03-06 16:26:16 Let me guess, Tillerson is prospecting for more oil for Exxon.
4335 2018-03-06 16:26:16 Yeah, you wanna moisturize. Baby oil is good too

4339 2018-03-06 16:26:00 This is a nuanced discussion: Diet and exercise has always had great results. Main takeaway: monetizing a recommendation before there is strong evidence/scientific consensus (more than there is at this time) is akin to snake oil pseudoscience. Agree @drg1985?
4340 2018-03-06 16:25:51 Drove to Chaco 10-12 years ago. Campground was jammed & I freaked out: kids on trikes, radios blaring, ridiculous. Split for Bisti Badlands to spend the night. Deserted, quiet at first. Awakened early by industrial noises. Hiked over hill, found oil wells!
4341 2018-03-06 16:25:36 this lavender and coconut oil in my bath is everything rn 
4342 2018-03-06 16:25:33 Distribution channels will still have leverage. It’s not as though galleries own all the canvas and oil paints in existence either. It’s the liquidity their networks of buyers bring that give them pricing power on their cut of the proceeds. Don’t see the chain changing that.
4343 2018-03-06 16:25:33 Why is it always "gun violence" and not "violent crime"?
4344 2018-03-06 16:25:31 We need to get away from fossil fuels.  The oil companies own more politicians than the NRA
4345 2018-03-06 16:25:25 You mean a heat-pump? That might also work for us (as we can reuse the hole where they put the diesel tank - I thought that by oil you meant diesel), if you can redo your floors you can heat them too for free, for us it's not possible.
4346 2018-03-06 16:24:54 No way.  2019. They want $100 oil

4354 2018-03-06 16:23:56 3 every 5k miles my car tells me when oil needs changed but I change it before then.

4376 2018-03-06 16:21:51 Yes! We should only have money from foreign oil and gas companies to influence our governments.
4377 2018-03-06 16:21:49 It is really bad here. We have a generator, so we are not suffering too much. We will be if we do not get fuel oil, that is the biggest concern. We need access to our driveway for that. Glad you have power for now stay safe. My thoughts are with those less fortunate than us.
4378 2018-03-06 16:21:46 Talcum Powder will remove oil spots.
4379 2018-03-06 16:21:46 vaping cannabis oil is great
4380 2018-03-06 16:21:44 The good news is that @Olleco_SCC have just turned up to collect our used cooking oil....   thinned down a little the diesel generator wouldn't take any harm surely? Where are those hose pipes...

4394 2018-03-06 16:20:25 Why? In the unlikely event of a spill Oil has no lasting environmental impact it is although I’m sure your opinion differs on that, the economic impact has far reaching benefit to all corners of society. I think your wrong and you don’t speak for me or 99% of Albertans

4408 2018-03-06 16:18:58 Yes, oil heat here. On the upside, heating oil is the same thing as Diesel so you can run a whole house Diesel generator on the oil.

Solar doesn’t make a lot of sense where we are, but geothermal might. Huge upfront investment but then you basically have “free” heat and cooling
4409 2018-03-06 16:18:56 Maybe if wind power had the same lobbying power as big oil does.....
4410 2018-03-06 16:18:42 More oil job lies from Trump
4411 2018-03-06 16:18:17 Republicans get a much higher share of Hispanic voters in TX than they do in other places (CA), so the demographics often mislead.  If most people vote based on tribe, a lot of TX hispanics love guns, church, pickups,  AND employed by oil/natural gas.
4412 2018-03-06 16:18:16 That's because you'd rather be a slave to foreign oil
4413 2018-03-06 16:18:05 my dad is so supportive of any small thing I do like I just got my oil changed by myself and he said he was proud of me
4414 2018-03-06 16:18:01 I usually use the flower but the oil works too.  Best of luck with all the sickies!!
4415 2018-03-06 16:17:59 It would help combat fuel poverty if the gov could “encourage” gas companies to extend their delivery network to rural areas. Relying on oil is expensive
4416 2018-03-06 16:17:51 How can you create wealth from debt? Oil!
4417 2018-03-06 16:17:34 You've just said exactly what I said then added your own rubbish. It's just cheaper for some countries to make dollar purchases through selling bonds but it's risky. Oil is for sale in $ nothing else.

4421 2018-03-06 16:16:53 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for activated charcoal enemas, and put some cacao essential oil in my diffuser.
4422 2018-03-06 16:16:48 We could stop all the shipping containers going to Alberta,quit bullying us and send your Oil back East where Canadians need it
4423 2018-03-06 16:16:38 Drugs and peppermint oil
4424 2018-03-06 16:16:33 So Kenney threatening to cut off oil and gas to BC, does it remind anyone else of Putin cutting off gas to the Ukraine?
4425 2018-03-06 16:16:32 The meeting with EPA will be at EPA headquarters. The oil group is also gathering at the Trump hotel.
4426 2018-03-06 16:16:26 Imagine Rebuilding North Korea's infrastructure with American steel and oil.

4429 2018-03-06 16:16:19 Had the follow-up with my PCV (Primary Care Vampire), and my blood shows that I need more Vitamin D (lack of sunlight, ironic), fish oil, and less red meat. Doing this should improve my health
4430 2018-03-06 16:16:16 @royalenfield what to do if someone got delivery of gunmetal grey with poor engine oil?
4431 2018-03-06 16:16:15 1 wife, 9 falcons and 3 barrels of crude oil
4432 2018-03-06 16:16:09 so would me having 3 chocolate bars at 600kcals be better than me having a huge delicious salad with lentils, olive oil, cheese and maybe some pine nuts at 700kcals? is that right?
4433 2018-03-06 16:15:58 Let's see....they gave Tillerson a 'you're a good boy' medal...and they gave Donnie the Whitehouse .... There's the whole future oil deals & Ukraine thing.....might be these are a goodly part of it... #TrumpRussiaInvestigation

4435 2018-03-06 16:15:53 The new #Starbucks in Wesley Chapel on S.R. 54 is a great place to get some work done and wait for an oil change at the same time!  Have you tried their Nitro Cold Brew on tap yet? #coffeetweet
4436 2018-03-06 16:15:51 I blend up my own bulletproof coffee. I don't use anyone's MCT oil product. I use a press pot of Yirgacheffe, Kerrygold unsalted butter, raw coconut oil, and a healthy dose of 85% dark chocolate. Drinking this for breakfast helped me out a lot: mood, weight, energy, even gums.
4437 2018-03-06 16:15:37 The COT report show money managers 95.9% long  crude oil. Does that mean maybe we should be short?
4438 2018-03-06 16:15:33 MAD at what? The NDP dug you out of a horrible economic slump, diversified it and is pushing for an additional outlet for you TAR sands. The Conservatives were in the pockets of the oil industry and did not put anything aside for a slump or once the oil ran out. Duhhh
4439 2018-03-06 16:15:32 Cold brew
Coconut milk
MCT oil

Try it
4440 2018-03-06 16:15:27 Where is it in the owners manual that the car will burn oil and cause the car to shut off if you don't have the oil change done within a certain time frame? I am calling corporate and a attorney. This car is unsafe.
4441 2018-03-06 16:15:25 Well, there ya go! My point is that until technology improves oil will be needed. End of story 
4442 2018-03-06 16:15:18 Do you see how it is made from oil products Catherine. Without oil that can’t be built.
4443 2018-03-06 16:15:10 Is liver sausage an omega 3 fish oil?

4445 2018-03-06 16:15:02 Reminder to vegan friends: Oreo's use palm oil, and the "sustainable" sourcing of which may be questionable.
4446 2018-03-06 16:14:44 "Monopolies only exist because the State enforces them"
Have a quick look at the history of Standard Oil, a company that secured a monopoly without any state actions.
4447 2018-03-06 16:14:40 As an aside: I love Peterson's Alberta intellectual aesthetic. Practical unpretentious cowboy boots. Jeans. Reasonable jacket. No visible belt buckle (this isn't a rodeo, funeral or meeting with Calgary oil execs, ffs)

4451 2018-03-06 16:14:29 Dear oil change place cashier: I do not want to hear your general announcement about how cold you are, how your kid is doing in school, or how your popcorn tastes.

I just want my damn oil change.
4452 2018-03-06 16:14:22 Everyone on the #CERAWeek Global Oil Panel agree that Oil and gas demand will continue to grow.
4453 2018-03-06 16:14:15 So i bought myself castor and coconut oil cause im experiencing a severe hair loss god help me
4454 2018-03-06 16:14:15 Hahaha! Joking la! So, burning the midnight oil?
4455 2018-03-06 16:14:05 It's a well known supposition that Republicans are better looking, smarter and wealthier than Democrats.  I think there are studies out there, but I don't care enough to look.
4456 2018-03-06 16:13:59 lmaooo so i store my cooking oil in that cabinet above the stove and all i can picture is my girl yelling “baaaaaaabe! can you reach this for me please!!” 
4457 2018-03-06 16:13:53 @emilygosden Hi Emily I work for @SpectrumGeo . We have an oil minister visiting next week from a West African country which has had a recent discovery and he's keen to speak to the media about his countrie's energy plans. Is this something you might attend?
4458 2018-03-06 16:13:49 But...but, Will...if there are no pictures of guns, *there will be no violence.*

The party of science says so!
4459 2018-03-06 16:13:48 hey im going to be getting really high off of marijuana hash oil and caffeine for an hour if u wanna come thru
4460 2018-03-06 16:13:43 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt
4461 2018-03-06 16:13:37 Castor oil???
4462 2018-03-06 16:13:36 Truth: I didn’t want to scratch the stainless. Later I will try the baby oil or olive oil or mineral oil method. So: the olive oil method. I’m not going upstairs for the others. (resistance)

4464 2018-03-06 16:13:13 Why do my armpits smell like tea tree oil
4465 2018-03-06 16:13:11 8008 has been somewhat of the LAF's workhorse/available reserve. Deployed from Benghazi to the Oil Crescent and now the southern theater.
4466 2018-03-06 16:13:06 Yes, or another unexpected incident causing unexpected damages, no need for a core fusion to have huge "industrial and ecological damages". Same for oil supertankers...
4467 2018-03-06 16:13:04 Castor oil???
4468 2018-03-06 16:13:03 I made an appt for an oil change at 10 & I was here so why is it 12 minutes later & they haven't moved my car? 
4469 2018-03-06 16:12:59 What was in those countries was reasoning for increase in budgets, drugs, weapon contracts, oil, gold, potential for further conflicts to expand military contracts, a force into debt, expanding imperialism. Not freedom. You're not spreading democracy with puppet leaders and debt.
4470 2018-03-06 16:12:56 FACT: Electric cars are far more expensive to operate than gas cars. Oil is finite. We still have plenty of time to develop alternative transportation. The time will come when oil will only be used to lubricate moving parts.
4471 2018-03-06 16:12:53 If we're over producing please tell me why we're shutting down parts of national parks in the name of needed oil and natural gas exploration.
4472 2018-03-06 16:12:43 And If you get my RT w/ initial message, may I add that it's time to take what Sechin stated in FT - Putin's 'grand plan' just became 'grander'. RU-Saudi-EXXON b/c RU-China-Saudi w/ +1. They ARE NOW developing global control of OIL markets, not billions> TRILLIONS=security threat
4473 2018-03-06 16:12:36 Assume Russia is responsible. BJ decides England might not go to WC! Not stop Russians buying lots of property in London, stop taking their gas, oil etc. Freezing money being laundered daily criminal Russian gangs over here. MR Putin must be quaking in his Valenki’s.

4475 2018-03-06 16:12:13 The shale oil boom has been going on for a decade and the US has been one of the, if not thee, top producer of petroleum/natural gas for years. #ThanksObama.
4476 2018-03-06 16:12:05 OK, I know nothing about this but has anybody out there tried CBD oil? H&B are selling it. Positive effects or snake oil?

today is oil attack.
Beard cheek etc.
I'm not suit for damage absorption.
Just pain.
But if You smile it will be easy to forget.
I'm happy if people can smile.
Today such a dish.
Goodnight and I loveyou.

4481 2018-03-06 16:11:46 Cheers man, that’s all a good place to start. Kale is good stuff man, chuck that in the oven with a little olive oil and salt and you’ll never need crisps again :)
4482 2018-03-06 16:11:39 Need to go get my oil changed tomorrow.
4483 2018-03-06 16:11:36 WTF is Bumble?
4484 2018-03-06 16:11:32 Yoruba people cook oil and spice it with tomatoes and pepper
4485 2018-03-06 16:11:31 And if you don’t have cobalt, no lithium ion batteries.  No oil, no gas.  The list can go on forever!
4486 2018-03-06 16:11:31 What model do you have? You are one of the .01 percent. Oil is still used like DVD's in 1995. And, you just turned your tailpipe into either a nuclear waste factory or a smokestack.
4487 2018-03-06 16:11:30 Olive octane oil
4488 2018-03-06 16:11:27 It is not good to accidentally rub you eye after touching Peppermint essential oil! 
4489 2018-03-06 16:11:24 Simple...if you are against getting our oil and LNG to shoreline you are not aware of its vital importance.
4490 2018-03-06 16:11:18 Castle Lager now has 1 litre. When are we getting 1 litre of Castor Oil?
4491 2018-03-06 16:11:17 " BUY STANDARD OIL"

4493 2018-03-06 16:10:59 Yeah i think it’s argan oil!! And thank you
4494 2018-03-06 16:10:45 @AJStream @KameliaKilawan Legislators claim they were trying to be fiscally responsible, and I believe some may be genuine. But ultimately many have ties with big coal, oil, and gas companies. We pushed for an increase of severance tax to put WV people first but it didn’t happen
4495 2018-03-06 16:10:41 Convicted fraudster who ran cannabis oil distillery in his Grenfell Tower flat is given a 12 week suspended sentence
4496 2018-03-06 16:10:29 Will you teach them how to dictate other countries and wage a war in order to get their oil?
4497 2018-03-06 16:10:28 The shit ones (ie Gulf) Will die off the country's that got destroyed tho will be harder to rebuild
And there is only a monopoly if the Chinese sell cheap quality panels...If they dont they get overtaken by us firms and it Will increase us energy independance unlike oil in the me
4498 2018-03-06 16:10:24 North Korea needs imported food and oil and sanctions are impacting that need. It's been a predictable cycle for the DPRK so long. A view to next winter.@stephenfhayes

4500 2018-03-06 16:10:13  I didn't even noticed that  My mind must have just known what you meant. A few days before we were tagged in an image of a dog going in the snow with and without coconut oil on - walking a cockatoo would have been very interesting though 
4501 2018-03-06 16:10:10 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
4502 2018-03-06 16:10:10 I just learned that there's something called Danish oil and I bet it's not even invented by a Dane or in Denmark
4503 2018-03-06 16:09:58 Isn't Eddy's actor an oil tycoon now? That's like, the most Eddy career imaginable.
4504 2018-03-06 16:09:57 How is stopping oil to BC Communism? LoL It’s actually opposite of Communism, it’s free enterprise, the right to buy or sell to whom ever they wish, like wine. Communists would say you must sell oil to BC & you can’t sell oil beyond BC, only to BC. 
Regardless the law is the law.
4505 2018-03-06 16:09:48 New study from @UCalgary School of Public Policy says #Alberta could be losing up to $6.60 on every barrel of heavy oil exported to the US which amounts to annual losses of $7.2 billion in provincial government revenues #yyc @CTVCalgary
4506 2018-03-06 16:09:46 He replaced a nuclear physicist with Rick Perry to head the Dept. of Energy. Rick Perry later admitted he had no idea what the department actually did. He thought they just deal with oil companies, and gosh a Texas boy is perfect.

4508 2018-03-06 16:09:35 Someone please tell Oklahoma to make up the difference by raising the tax on oil gas coal and chewing tobacco.

4510 2018-03-06 16:09:33 Am I the only one who hates getting an oil change?
4511 2018-03-06 16:09:15 That’s awesome Gary. Cauliflower rice is a killer hack. Do you have a favorite preparation? I’ve done both baking and pan frying (with olive oil, salt + pepper), and I find baking gets the best texture as a rice replacement.

Replacing bread with lettuce wraps has been less ideal
4512 2018-03-06 16:09:14 When I was growing up my Mum had a aromatherapy phase that ended pretty abruptly after the lavender oil left me with crippling headaches and vomiting. Thankfully my current abode is nicely secluded away from lavender bushes
4513 2018-03-06 16:08:58 Man caught with cannabis oil distillery at his flat in Grenfell Tower  explained the £1,000 in  cash found in the ceiling was holiday  money given to him by his brother
4514 2018-03-06 16:08:54 Not True now, the steel tariff is going to hurt the oil industry
just like auto, we will lose thousands of jobs as a result
Just like solar, you a screwing America out of jobs and money because you don't understand the Economy

Trump is ruining @BarackObama's economy
4515 2018-03-06 16:08:32 Strip your hair they said it'll be fine they said now sat with friggin orange ends I can't dye due to burns on my scalp Fml and on another plus note medication for vit d deficiency tastes like castor oil I'd rather risk it thanks!!! #todaycandoone #orangehairdocare

4517 2018-03-06 16:08:26 So I have to wait an hour for an oil change and I just remembered my stydia fic is in my google docs sooooo
4518 2018-03-06 16:08:26 I certainly hope not.

Cartel’s call for greater focus on oil fundamentals was both right and wrong
4521 2018-03-06 16:08:08 Some say the next Great War will be fought over oil. Others say it will be over water. I think it will be over the 3 working power outlets at any American airport.
4522 2018-03-06 16:08:04 Great! All that remains is to wind down the oil and gas side of the business!
4523 2018-03-06 16:08:03 Jr needs a meeting with Aladdin and I dream of Jeannie too. We need magic carpets and eye blink transportation in replace of oil and gas for transportation.
4524 2018-03-06 16:07:58 But isn't the US already the richest? And how much of that oil money does every American get?
4525 2018-03-06 16:07:44 we are being shockingly lied to by arms dealing oil stealing despotic western govts.
4526 2018-03-06 16:07:27 Apps for ending corruption and traffic jam. That's expecting too much from technology, it's akin to gulping anointing oil expecting a garden to dig, plant and harvest itself. And ultimately cook, chew and swallow the food for you. Let's be real

4531 2018-03-06 16:06:53 The #CERAWeek comments from @AdnocGroup CEO are on the antipodes of #Aramco. No business as usual, fast changing energy landscape, diversifying into refining and chemicals as hedge to just pumping crude #oil. Of course, #UAE isn’t seeking to IPO its core #oil business. #OOTT
4532 2018-03-06 16:06:28 The global oil and gas industry needs to invest more than $20 trillion over the next 25 years to meet expected growth in demand and compensate for the natural decline in developed fields, Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said on Tu...
4533 2018-03-06 16:06:26 Cepat lah sampai my face oil i memang dah habis kering kontang betul all moisturiser niiiii. Buat hal pulak kata boleh collect kat batu cave. Sapa nak pi colllectttttt
4534 2018-03-06 16:06:21 Exactly...and this can not be achieved in 5 days. I have seen newly qualified oil engineers want to rip boilers out and replace because they had no clue it was being switched on via the auxillary switch in the motorised valve...just needed a new head on the valve.
4535 2018-03-06 16:06:17 This tweet is reserved solely as encouragement for Trump supporters.  They only care about it because they think we need oil that doesn’t come from brown people overseas.

4537 2018-03-06 16:06:15 Just got my haircut and the geezer said my hair was dry so sprayed some olive oil spray on it or something and now I look like the greasiest peado
4538 2018-03-06 16:06:11 In my painting class we use a mixture of turpentine, linseed oil, and gamsol. They all do different things that I don’t really remember except turpentine will make it dry quickly

4543 2018-03-06 16:05:39 .Steel however, IS a national security issue, to be dependent on foreign steel is insanity! Also, Food and oil.
4544 2018-03-06 16:05:24 I look at it this way: If we are still  using oil in the next 5+ years, it is better if the oil is produced here in the US. This way we do not have to rely on other countries, governments, etc. At the same time, renewable energies can compete against oil, get my point?
4545 2018-03-06 16:05:17 @ManUtd has won everything with their hard work. we dnt have any owners who own most of the oil companies in Arab. we won nothing by spending money. we won everything with passion and hard work. ur academy is not even close to us, neither ur trophy cabinet.
4546 2018-03-06 16:05:12 They can afford the oil and gas tax breaks though, I'm SURE
4547 2018-03-06 16:05:11 Try some CBD oil!! Just be careful!! When I was pain free the other day, was overzealous! Forgot to take it easy. Next day, could barely move!!! 
4548 2018-03-06 16:04:53 it's 12AM and i have bunch of assignments to get done and i have an 8:30AM class tomorrow. should i risk burning the midnight oil tonight?
4549 2018-03-06 16:04:45 But I frankly amused by your delusion with his regime. You clearly know how last 6years of his power corrupted common people by constant lies, via cultivation of fears and exploitation of all wrong parts in people. One can get lucky on oil but  corruption of people is deliberate
4550 2018-03-06 16:04:40 Would never be stupid enough to vote for a moron of a president like DT..  all knew he was a fraud and a snake oil salesmsn with no government experience and ties to Russia. So NO. I'm not drinking the same poisoned milk from the contaminated Trump cow.
4551 2018-03-06 16:04:30 He's brilliant crack. 'I want to get some baby oil on, shining, glistening'.
4552 2018-03-06 16:04:27 BP was only one of a multitude of companies extracting oil from the UK sector. Brent field for example run by Shell.
4553 2018-03-06 16:04:25 But without electricity heating would kill us first, we have an archaic system (oil burning) which I really want to replace, I think you have the same? We have a wood stove which we can use, but no electricity means no fan to eject the hot air.
4554 2018-03-06 16:04:22 So coal has basically been halted. Oil production is way down yet our carbon output is up ?
4555 2018-03-06 16:04:22 Why does my whole apartment smell like olive oil. 

(... #TuesdayThoughts , I guess)
4556 2018-03-06 16:04:09 If we can ship in oil and steel from other countries , why don’t we just close down all Hollywood studios and just get our movies and tv from other nations? What’s the difference?
4557 2018-03-06 16:04:02 Given that they seem to keep finding more oil this does seem unlikely.

4560 2018-03-06 16:03:54 poor oil sector - wait not.

4561 2018-03-06 16:03:41 .@JustinTrudeau just knocked a question out of the park on oil, gas, pipelines, and the carbon leadership Canada is doing at the Bill Nye sitdown in Ottawa.

4563 2018-03-06 16:03:35 i’m sucking the last lil bit of oil on my pen listening to ozuna, today better be great
4564 2018-03-06 16:03:32 I was surprised to see so many oil derricks on my recent L.A. trip.
4565 2018-03-06 16:03:32 It looks better on pictures tbh  my hair is quite damaged  I'm just using hair oil everyday and every now and then I put some coconut oil in it and let it stay over night :)

4568 2018-03-06 16:03:23 The global oil and gas industry needs to invest more than $20 trillion over the next 25 years to meet expected growth in demand and compensate for the natural decline in developed fields, Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said on Tu...
4569 2018-03-06 16:03:19 DID OPEC FUND ENVIRONMENTALIST TO CAMPAIGN AND PROTEST AGAINST SHALE OIL?  or was it Ruski ? Something to think about

4571 2018-03-06 16:03:08 Bullshit. Penalty for landlocked oil, as well as a railway glut. KXL and East/West pipelines would take care of that.

4585 2018-03-06 16:01:29 Any kind of stir fry is super easy. I start out with garlic and onions, a protein or tofu and add whatever veggies are in the fridge that'll go. A bit of hoisin, or oyster or mushroom sauce, sesame oil and it's all good to me.

4587 2018-03-06 16:01:17 I swear every time I go to the dealership for an oil change I’m taken advantage of & ridiculously overpriced. Had them talk to my daddy who lowered it to half the amount they quoted me! Forever a daddy’s girl.
4588 2018-03-06 16:01:17 Since THC is in essence a sunscreen for darker leafy greens, that acts by splitting the prism of light on a oil filled mushroom shaped tricomb, sending the refreacted light into the central nervous system of the plant as energy for photosynthesis.

4597 2018-03-06 16:00:38 @HoppyKercheval Why are we not looking at our resources: gas & oil??? Why can't West Virginians benefit--for once!--from our natural resources? Do we really think these companies will leave these resources behind?
4598 2018-03-06 16:00:31 You're right. probably going to resort to pasta with olive oil (safe!)
4599 2018-03-06 16:00:30 Lying in bed, listening to the Doors.

4600 2018-03-06 16:00:26 I’m on the fence on this. I think truffle oil is overused and usually in the wrong way. Shaved truffles I do enjoy.
4601 2018-03-06 16:00:23 Is this because he's tainted?  In this for the oil?  Has some other not-innocent motive?  Is he genuinely being a good civil servant.  What's up?  Is there news about his conflicts of interest on which media/others should report?
4602 2018-03-06 16:00:06 Only broiled in the oven with olive oil and Penzey's Fox Point seasoning...or wrapped in bacon. Otherwise, bleh!

4610 2018-03-06 15:59:34 Yes - I invest in American energy production - we have astounding reserves - and marvelous new drilling and recovery technology - this is the 21st century folks - times have changed and the oil patch is now nearly all of America and Canada - energy independence can be achieved -
4611 2018-03-06 15:59:32 Ryan Zinke to oil and gas industry at CERAWeek: wind and solar power have "costs." Wind "chops up" 750,000 birds and solar takes away public land that could be used for recreation, hunting, etc.
4612 2018-03-06 15:59:27 ..this is getting out of hand.Its time oil companies got involved and more legislation be pushed against littering
4613 2018-03-06 15:59:23 Butternut squash in the oven, little bit of oil, sunflower or avaocado oil whatever you like, sprinkle some paprika over the squash and let it bake. Then pour the chilli on top 
4614 2018-03-06 15:59:09 Think we can also thank low oil price and efficient aircraft and leadership plays a part  but also the thousands of workers who put in a shift day in and day out in difficult conditions sometimes.

4630 2018-03-06 15:57:10 You have to start somewhere. Trump pushing coal and NOT pushing solar, is going backwards and lazy.  Creating a competitive solar market and industry would be a good thing, but big oil still owns all the politicians, and in some cases, ARE the politicians.

4635 2018-03-06 15:57:03 I'm amazed how our oil resource is affected by the desire for independence. If we give up the cause we will probibly be told that we have hunners of oil, hunners I tell you!

4702 2018-03-06 15:49:48 let's hope it comes to a conclusion...I use to fly from Sullom Voe to the Ninian Northern oil rig...Not a lot of people know that...
4703 2018-03-06 15:49:45 Coconut oil really can be used for anything.
4704 2018-03-06 15:49:41 #OIL so good today..

4706 2018-03-06 15:49:36 #Trudeau put personal views on social issues aside &focus on getting our recourses to markets other than #USA. The money USA spends backing #activists to stop #pipelines s/b exposed for what it is. #Trump laughing all the way to the bank as u do nothing to get our #oil to #market
4707 2018-03-06 15:49:35 Apply ghee in your nabhi. Use organic argan oil - a drop or two on face. What you use to clean your face also matters.
4708 2018-03-06 15:49:34 I use the plum toner then face shop chia seed serum then eye gel then the night cream and THEN a face oil by Ayca. My bedtime moisturising routine is a bit extra
4709 2018-03-06 15:49:30 + coconut oil, vitamin E oil. You could do coconut alone. I separate it and add honey and lemon for my face . Yo trust you’ll love it

4712 2018-03-06 15:48:55 The more you know RT @_viciwill: coconut oil is fantastic lubricant. also keeps your vaginal pH in check.
4713 2018-03-06 15:48:43 All my Family can say on the Oil & Gas Industry is, Thank you President Trump for getting rid of those 73 Regulations , Obama put on the Industry between 2012/2016 We respect the environment and so does the Industry
4714 2018-03-06 15:48:24 At a time when most of the world is moving away from oil usage. Yep, keep that pollution going in the good ole US of A.
4715 2018-03-06 15:48:23 I’ve tried every oil I know on my daughter’s hair and can not find ONE that will lock in moisture...I need help.
4716 2018-03-06 15:48:23 #GAA2018 Gherardi: Water-based #gravure #printing #inks typically have foaming problem; micro-foam lessens color density while building viscosity which can fool press operators; ratio of return ink is important; defoamers = oil, silicone, silica, others.
4717 2018-03-06 15:48:19 How hard will ESPN be pumping the fake "QB competition" between Fromm and Fields in the offseason?
- A) Just most of the time
- B) More than T. Boone Pickens has pumped for oil in his lifetime

4719 2018-03-06 15:48:12 I have an idea for a website when the oil price starts accelerating out of control, breaking logistics companies worldwide 1 by 1 (2030+ onwards).

It is fairly simple, but cannot be done until the money systems breaks.
4720 2018-03-06 15:48:09 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.

4723 2018-03-06 15:47:42 fact: coconut oil saves lives
4724 2018-03-06 15:47:37 Because Muslim countries have oil at the moment . Didn't you read history ?India was slaved for centuries by England? What your county done wrong at that time?
4725 2018-03-06 15:47:36 So here’s a question....I make 12 mini chocolate chip cookies almost every night....using 1 and 1/4 tbsp of butter.....and I don’t like the idea of eating so much butter almost every day. So, does anyone knw how much coconut oil I should substitute instead? Thanks!
4726 2018-03-06 15:47:32 @molly_oil
4727 2018-03-06 15:47:30 Having oil refinery's is not a blow out of jobs!Wat about all these other companies closing stores? Those are lost jobs!  So unless majority of the country is gonna work for oil those refinery's will NEVER replace the jobs that are being lost as we speak! So ur post is irelivant!
4728 2018-03-06 15:47:20 Obama spent 7 years waffling over KXL
The US considers Canadian oil and gas as part of their strategic reserves.
Millions of US dollars have been spent in Canada, funding eco activists in an attempt to stymie pipline development
 The USA that doesn't want our oil to hit tidewater

4730 2018-03-06 15:47:06 NOT WITH TRUMP AS POTUS-@realDonaldTrump "Fake News" reports'Tariff Catastrophe','Senate up in arms'.
No one reports:A reduction in National Debt  without punishing WeThePeople. MAGA, US can become a future net exporter of steel and alum. just as done in oil. Turn -$1T to +$1T
4731 2018-03-06 15:47:00 I often say that the world cannot run on batteries, that's just a mad mad dream. Batts are just another way to keep us dependent on lithium - the way we became dependent on oil. Batts make sense for things like bikes, but cars, trucks, ships? No way.
4732 2018-03-06 15:46:54 Elizabeth,
Joint Relief I not snake oil, our hundreds of customers would tell you that in a second. This product works VERY, VERY well at alleviating joint pain and inflammation. Send me your address and I'll send you a free sample and if it doesn't work I'll eat my baseball cap
4733 2018-03-06 15:46:46 How about solar or other renewable energy?  Let's focus on something that will maintain.  The easiest path isn't always the best path.  Why not create jobs in those areas rather than oil?  Oh wait you line your pockets.
4734 2018-03-06 15:46:45 #OIL journos sadly stuck at #CERAWeek 

It's not that they want to, it's coz they have to.
4735 2018-03-06 15:46:39 You’re a little late to be concerned all of a sudden after 8 years without a budget and out of control, off the books spending by OBOZO! With the economy booming, employment at record highs, jobs pouring into America, coal exports, oil soon to be a money maker, just wait!

4744 2018-03-06 15:45:37 This US person says - what Democracy? With Russia’s help we are currently run by big oil & their biz cronies against Corp. regulation. How dare anyone get in the way of big Biz freedom to own governments & pollute the world. Russia happy to help end liberal democracy everywhere.
4745 2018-03-06 15:45:35 I don't disagree, but I'm interested in doing things now. Yes, federal and state systems need to be brought in line for better bckgrnd checks. No guns for mentally ill but that is harder to define and will be challenged by ACLU. Let's harden our schools.
4746 2018-03-06 15:45:31 Which way Nigeria? No positive thing happening. What happened to the crude oil money since 1958. So much poverty in the country. We also need check our growing population. It’s alarming
4747 2018-03-06 15:45:24 Man will never understand a woman & vice versa. We are oil & water. An  equal level can never be maintained, as 1 will always excel where the other doesn't, & that breeds resentment. We are both #LimitedEditions & ought to strive to live together in harmony.

4751 2018-03-06 15:45:18 West Texas was once green, they pumped oil out, now it's sand, you want to do that to our country? You choose the most outdated thing and push for it, coal, steel, oil, technology and need has moved beyond these industries. Oil is finite, coal is finite, steel is finite.

4753 2018-03-06 15:45:12 So were in 2018 right, where are the jobs gonna be for the next 5 years until were projected to be the largest oil producer??
4754 2018-03-06 15:45:00 Mugs who bought #ukog at 1.9p+ on tweets of frozen oil equipment and RNSs announcing more delays (but no flow rate results) can now sell at 1.65p a few hours later.

4757 2018-03-06 15:44:44 Well, they had been drilling for oil in Iran since 1903 and Bahrain since 1931.

4759 2018-03-06 15:44:30 The globalists have been sitting on the largest oil reserve in the world for 5 decades...now it is open for business.
4760 2018-03-06 15:44:05 Weight gainers drink olive oil for easy calories
4761 2018-03-06 15:43:58 i had to drive 90 miles to find a semi deserted beach once and it was covered with (oil spill) tar balls that stuck to our feet
4762 2018-03-06 15:43:54 I am very happy and I know that we have a lot of oil this is one of the reason the Globulists want America to be destroy .Sean please be careful they are out to get you Florida is not doing very well the Barbarians are all over
4763 2018-03-06 15:43:47 I can recommend a few things--infrequent shampooing (once or twice a week), heavy cream conditioner (double plus good if you leave in overnight), and argan oil (just focus on your ends)! I have curly frizzy hair though so you might only need to use one of these.
4764 2018-03-06 15:43:46 coconut oil!
4765 2018-03-06 15:43:46 Only thing Zinke is protecting is his wallet, by selling out America's public lands to oil and gas companies.
4766 2018-03-06 15:43:31 You see Iraq, Iran, Saudi, and all those other oil producing countries? At one time they weren't all sand, they were green like it is here, grass, bushes, trees all over the place, then they pumped the oil out of the ground, drained away the nutrients from the dirt.
4767 2018-03-06 15:43:30 That's not a good thing we need to be moving away from oil for the sake of our futures
4768 2018-03-06 15:43:28 @exxonmobil Maybe one of the weak analyst's can ask Mr. Woods a real QUESTION; why isn't XOM performing like   CVX; RDSA; BP; TOT; ENI;  WAIT, isn't that every integrated oil major.
4769 2018-03-06 15:43:25 Have you thought where we would store all this oil when the global recession hits?

4779 2018-03-06 15:42:22 We finally get back the 70's, after congress eliminated our energy producing states from being competitive, switching the dollar from Gold to Oil, causing the recession form 81' to 85'.
4780 2018-03-06 15:42:11 Amazing! While the rest of the world is ending its dependencies on oil you’re putting the US at the teat of Big Oil. This is energy dependence, not independence. #maga #Impeach45 #ImpeachTrumpNow
4781 2018-03-06 15:42:11 Wait until the. What do you want what you want from me, haven't you stolen enough oil already?
4782 2018-03-06 15:42:00 Every President we've had says "we're going to become energy independent" none of them actually took steps to do so, but we finally have a President who follows through on what he says. Now the middle east buys oil from AMERICA, never thought I'd see the day
4783 2018-03-06 15:41:56 ADVISORY: Hwy 116 is CLOSED in #Guerneville due to a crash and oil spill near River Rd.  Avoid the area.

4786 2018-03-06 15:41:39 My dad used to always talk about how the US and Japan were negotiating a deal in Washington, to ease up on sactions/oil restrictions, when they turned around and stabbed us in the back. Sure hope Little Rocket Man hasn't been studying WW2

4791 2018-03-06 15:41:07 Yes & some say he has a bias. His new company, Continental Resource Development, is focused on Permian. Critics say Continental would benefit if oil prices increased based on Papa's public remarks. 

I suppose so but wouldn't that be true for everyone else also?
4792 2018-03-06 15:41:02 I really burned that midnight oil last night. Today’s gonna be fun...

4794 2018-03-06 15:40:43 It was obvious from jump. Tillerson said he never wanted to be SoS. He has been awarded highest honors by Putin. He was head of Exxon. Rosneft oil is being blocked by sanctions. Russia wanted Ukraine's route to export oil. It's why the dust-up over Ukraine.
4795 2018-03-06 15:40:32 Yep, and how many oil workers are on an oil platform? Not 1000, not 500, not 200, not 100, maybe 10.  Yes, you are the BIG job creator! Lol!  So, who will benefit from this oil production, the U.S. Government? Will there be subsidies to States?
4796 2018-03-06 15:40:22 My recs: Tata Harper b/c it’s mildly exfoliating. May Lindstrom The Honey Mud b/c cleanser/mask duo w/ enzymes to balance/comfort. Votary Super Seed Cleansing Oil is great for stressed/reactive skin. Biologique Recherche Lait VIP O2 b/c it’s oxygenating/anti-pollution

4799 2018-03-06 15:40:11 President Trump is right that there is great energy in the White House. 

Speaking of energy: No one is talking about the upcoming oil boom & how Trump's administration is setting us up to take advantage of this great wealth.

4800 2018-03-06 15:40:05 Take a good hard look at that picture and all the petroleum products within the construction of that car. Until they start making cars with wood and hemp products oil is very much still a necessity.

4809 2018-03-06 15:39:36 We have been innovative in our work - NNPC reduces cost of producing a barrel of crude oil to N7,200
4810 2018-03-06 15:39:16 This is because everyone is moving away from oil to more sustainable energy sources.  We are the only country moving backwards supporting fossil fuels.
4811 2018-03-06 15:39:14 I would suggest oil washes if you up to trying something different. More control and easier to clean up. Burnt Amber will work wonderfully on that yellow
4812 2018-03-06 15:39:05 "This leaked diesel oil will help keep your 'helmet hair' look intact...."
4813 2018-03-06 15:38:57 Thinking long term, is it smart to invest in Saudi Aramco? I see the world using LESS oil in 5-10 years. Not more.

4816 2018-03-06 15:38:47 They've been using fees to replace the tax revenue but it's a not a good solution.  Income taxes are pretty low in the state and a small hike would bring in more revenue than these fees.  Add a cigarette tax and maybe a little production tax on oil and gas...

4845 2018-03-06 15:36:24 Just imagine how many of the people involved with these businesses are not billionaires...only @realDonaldTrump! Only the snake oil salesmen make the profits in the end.
4846 2018-03-06 15:36:17 Unfortunately Adam (the beard oil guy) moved to the woods off the grid in Alaska in a cabin and hasn’t kept up on his business. Sucks because it was a great product.
4847 2018-03-06 15:36:14 You gotta get well done fries at wingstop or it’s a bad of oil and soggy fries
4848 2018-03-06 15:36:12 I saw some oil on the top of the coffee and wasn’t sure if it was coffee oil or PB
4849 2018-03-06 15:36:10 Zinke talks of being pro-oil and gas, but also pro-energy across the  board. He says all energy options have consequences. That could be land use for a big solar project, birds for wind or carbon for oil/gas.

Shale producers are like scavenger living on landfill area.
This landfill area belongs to an oil industry 
4858 2018-03-06 15:34:51 Are you sorry you lied about swinney and the new oil fields?
Lets clear up yer misunderstanding on that first
4859 2018-03-06 15:34:49 How is coconut oil really this good for everything ?
4860 2018-03-06 15:34:42 I remember going up to Prudhoe Bay nine years ago -- and I ended up meeting some climate scientists who (incidentally) worked for an oil company up there.

We ended up talking, and they said (basically): "Good thing you came when you did. It won't be here long."
4861 2018-03-06 15:34:34 "I had an oil change done and it was a pleasant experience.  Nelson the owner is very friendly and helpful and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer

4865 2018-03-06 15:34:24 The GOP were paid by Russia. McConnell wouldn't support Obama on any legislations so why blame him for Russian interference.  An oil  executives who's allegiance to Putin is Secretary of State,  enough said. Tillerson and Trump were allocated money for  sanctions on Russia, -0-!
4866 2018-03-06 15:34:22 . That for an oil rig?
4867 2018-03-06 15:34:19 Chelsea are rebuilding.. City are city with unlimited oil money. All of them inc Madrid have something in common. They buy players and no one comes from academy. Pretty much buying success

4877 2018-03-06 15:33:32 Oil is fungible. It will just flow around a tariff. What the US wouldn't buy would be sold elsewhere while US buyers would go for the capacity that frees up.
4878 2018-03-06 15:33:30 No changes at LHR in terms of published departure procedures in the last 10-15 years. I was at CAA in 2014 when they trialled the RNAV1 changes which ended in Nov 2014 and reverted to the Conventional procedures. Partly as a response to high oil prices I suspect some operators
4879 2018-03-06 15:33:21 whoa, what. Even for all four tires you shouldn't break like $175 at MOST. Usually $100-$150 if it didn't come with a tire install warranty. And assuming your two filters were air and oil those are ~$20 each if you don't do it yourself, plus oil change I'd expect $235-$255 MAX
4880 2018-03-06 15:33:11 It’s time to dump oil, all it does, supports dictatorships like Russia and ruins the environment. It’s time for the renewable energy revolution. #EnergyRevolution

4886 2018-03-06 15:32:32 He's a twit and a puppet. He's just following the CIA owned US government & allowing the military complex to lay the ground work for a war they so desperately want with Russia/ China/ Iran (they come as a package). More oil &, natural gas 4 the west once we've 'liberated' them.

4901 2018-03-06 15:30:57 I have a question to ask !! you'll know what question is it .In south arabian oil is less of cost but in India agriculture is more but why we get in a high rate ??? Can the government take a action on this
4902 2018-03-06 15:30:56 In other words "GERS portrayed Indy more favourably then because of high oil revenue in 2012-13"
4903 2018-03-06 15:30:54 Our printer at work keeps jamming and my hands looks as if I’ve been changing my oil 
4904 2018-03-06 15:30:52 Is the main component of both essential oil the same?
4905 2018-03-06 15:30:44 Very true, yet Texas is a big state for oil. In some of the current events the EPA are looking for oil. The early elections are to see how much money needs to be poured into the elections to fulfill agendas with oil.  Its marketing, spying,  buying elections.
4906 2018-03-06 15:30:42 You tried snorting salt water? (im assuming you've tried the eucalyptus oil vapour with the towel)

4908 2018-03-06 15:30:40 There are no US protectionist policies - yet.

Friends don't impose trade sanctions on friends.
If steel and aluminum sanctions DO happen, let's turn off the oil and resume negotiating. America can enjoy $6.00/gallon gas too.

4912 2018-03-06 15:30:30 All linked to big oil take-over of our government which leads us back to sanctions and rosneft. Russian corruption aids US corruption & vice versa. Russia matters. Corruption matters. Global warming matters. Can’t regulate an out of control industry when they’ve taken over govt.
4913 2018-03-06 15:30:29 Yes we need some of this oil to pay off the debt . It must be done
4914 2018-03-06 15:30:20 Putin and the EU are frowning...but we warned the world that we are putting America First. No more dependency on other oil producing/exporting nations. FREEDOM!

4927 2018-03-06 15:29:33 Would we complain about oversupply of oil from OPEC?
4928 2018-03-06 15:29:33 Putin banked on oil and natural gas and it's not helping him. Do you realize most modern, progressive countries are moving to alternative energy. Oil, much like you, is a dinosaur.
4929 2018-03-06 15:29:33 Here we go playing Hokey Cokey with the oil. Last week it was reported that they had underestimated by decades.
4930 2018-03-06 15:29:27 US pumping out oil like nobody's business.
4931 2018-03-06 15:29:23 Am I the only one who thinks putting coconut oil in your hair (to repair, moisturize, add shine, etc) is kinda a scam? Tried it multiple times and it doesn't add a noticeable difference and just makes a huge mess

4933 2018-03-06 15:29:00 “I didnt have frying oil, so I used vinegar and olive oil.”

For the record,
Fry oil ≠ olive oil + vinegar

4935 2018-03-06 15:28:57 Donghyuck tried to teach him during nct life in paju (maybe?) and almost succeeded but Mark dumped the egg on the pan without putting oil there first so it was a failure anyway.
4936 2018-03-06 15:28:54 Then why our language is full of clicks, explain half khoisan Mandela. The world doesn't care about you. Global whiteness is dead. They care about Isis and Shia threat and to kiss saudi and Sunni oil farting ass. And their growing debt to China.

You our sons now, let's share
4937 2018-03-06 15:28:48 Global oil production could fall sharply just as demand picks up as theres been underinvestment in exploration etc .... so where does that put the price per barrel .... only way is up ! (They don't mention that)
4938 2018-03-06 15:28:44 Ryan Zinke up there now. Tells the crowd that he "doesn't want to see" us overseas fighting for energy...so we should produce it at home. (This implies, tho, that we shouldn't import anything? It also runs counter to Trump's assertion we should have taken Iraq's oil.)
4939 2018-03-06 15:28:44 So were seeing the PMs, equities & oil bounce i called for in the weekend review. So far so good. Now to wait for the short position to present itself. This market is going to cut up a lot of ppl be careful

4942 2018-03-06 15:28:15 You talked about hike in import duty on palm oil impacting Britannia, but how about softening sugar prices, another major raw material for Britannia@latha_venkatesh
4943 2018-03-06 15:28:09 1. China won't meeting the Paris agreement. 2. Their oil and energy is mostly imported. We are almost 100% energy independent, China is not.
4944 2018-03-06 15:28:06 These trumpeters are banal! Same thing every time! But Hillary...but Obama. Your orange god has sold us to Russia! Our Secretary of State was hand picked by the Russians. You good with that comrade?!? How about those 4 men killed protecting oil in Niger? Wake up!!
4945 2018-03-06 15:28:00 But fossil fuels. We just can't, with a clear conscience, keep burning more coal and oil
4946 2018-03-06 15:27:57 A 20 minute oil change has turned into an hour and a half ordeal. Appointment was at 9, got here at 8:45. Car wasn't brought in until 9:40 and is still in the shop. Well done, @Midas. Not like I have anything to do today.

4949 2018-03-06 15:27:48 Thats been obvious from Day 1, it was always about the $500 million invested by Tillerson while CEO of ExxonMobile in Russia for oil rights just before HC pushed for sanctions in retaliation for Ukraine invasion. Even Biden said she pushed while Obama wanted to send a letter.
4950 2018-03-06 15:27:45 That’s great until you realize that we don’t need oil...  it’s an archaic fuel that has already been replaced by new technologies and other countries are so far ahead of us that we might as well be cavemen. #trumpisafucktard

4952 2018-03-06 15:27:40 Why not olive oil ? I’m lost. Is margarine healthier ?
4953 2018-03-06 15:27:32 Strange it was only a couple about  a weeks or two ago that we were being told massive reserves for the next 30 years. oil - no oil - oil - no oil.  Anyone would thing they are trying to persuade us not to go independent?

4957 2018-03-06 15:27:04 I agree that people got much better than in 90s, but if be precise not all 18 years, 10 years is more real growth period. Concerning leadership I would thank @Aleksei_Kudrin and oil prices. State institutions degraded
4958 2018-03-06 15:27:01 He probably hates the US strong oil shale production stream.
4959 2018-03-06 15:27:00 Perhaps you'd prefer we return those shipments of heating oil from Siberia and we hike up the cost of heat while we set to fracking the Forest of Dean. Because some of us just are not quite poor enough just yet to feel that sovereignty bite.

4965 2018-03-06 15:26:30 That's because ordinary Syrians are being stopped from leaving, why? So terrorists can use them as human shields. Do some research, you twit. Why don't you talk about that? Why don't you talk about the illegally occupied Golan heights in Syria by Israel& their desire 2 steal oil?
4966 2018-03-06 15:26:14 For him that would be a deadly mistake. I would give them six months before they were attacked - though if they had oil it would be about one week
4967 2018-03-06 15:25:56 @ggtm_kkj which place you told me to go to for an oil change again?
4968 2018-03-06 15:25:53 so we have gone from an INCREASE in oil production to a DECREASE in oil production in the space of a WEEK?

4970 2018-03-06 15:25:46 here's a hint of olive oil, and a theatre class called The Eloquent Presenter
4971 2018-03-06 15:25:31 There is plenty of oil in the seas around Scotland  but consider
1) The cost of extraction
2) Whether we should keep supporting the use of fossil fuel.

However a professor of petroleum told me and others there will be an energy shortage in ten years and O&G is low hanging fruit
4972 2018-03-06 15:25:26 TRAITOR WANTS THE OIL.
4973 2018-03-06 15:25:18 because everyone wants to go back to the days of 100 oil, and can’t be bothered to inform themselves.
4974 2018-03-06 15:25:12 So you do realize that in the end with re-newable energy leading the way around the globe that you'll end up with a single market and a bucket load of oil that no one wants. Idiot!
4975 2018-03-06 15:25:05 Too bad eh...you know I take 4 Percocet a day, hydromorph contin & 55 Tylenol 1 a day...vapes are so expensive here. I'll die before my cannabis oil dream comes true. @vaporizerexpert I'm stuck in Canada. Been on narcotics since I was 12 & I'm 39 in May. Maybe one day

4980 2018-03-06 15:24:06 Y’all lied and said coconut oil was the answer to all our problems, when in fact it just clogs your pores 
4981 2018-03-06 15:23:55 All palm oil should be banned. There is a sketchy line in sustainable and it is often not. Processed food contains palm oil because it is cheap but the true cost is indescribable and unmeasurable. The only way this will stop is to stop buying all products that contain it.
4982 2018-03-06 15:23:48 he rubbed my feet with my massage oil from @GetLeighedCos last night. ugh. my feet smelled like fresh oranges & were sooo soft. I love my husband. 
4983 2018-03-06 15:23:47 It seems to me that you serve the NRA and the Oil/Gas/Mining industry.
4984 2018-03-06 15:23:29 @realDonaldTrump "Fake News" reports 'Tariff Catastrophe', 'Senate up in arms'.
No one reports: A way to reduce the National Debt @FixtheDebt  without punishing WeThePeople. MAGA, US can become a future net exporter of steel and alum. just as we have done in oil.

4987 2018-03-06 15:23:05 If it's true it's because everyone else is going to renewable and phasing out oil, Duh. So we are going backwards while the world moved forward and you think it's an applause line? You should be embarrassed. It shows you don't have a clue. You are a disaster.

4992 2018-03-06 15:22:21 I actually don't believe fiat will survive the end of the oil era (2030+), nor possibly crypto. i.e. Logistics companies will break 1 by 1 over several+ years.

5115 2018-03-06 15:10:48 Big jump in #Ghana where GDP growth revised to 8.3% over 2018. When I was in Accra and Takoradi in 2015 pessimism was high, since then services and oil&gas have led growth. Lets see if the new President's  One-District-One-Factory campaign pledge comes to fruition too.

5137 2018-03-06 15:08:43 With this make oil drilling equipment more expensive? So, lowered pay for rig workers, layoffs, cut hours are to be expected, correct? Oil companies gotta have that profit.
5138 2018-03-06 15:08:42 I'm watching closely how the Castro dictatorship takes steps to evolve into a fascist dictatorship which uses Marxism as a means or cover to control Venezuela and its oil reserves - with Obama et al's cooperation.
5139 2018-03-06 15:08:42 "They're sitting around their table just setting the price of oil and laughing at us because we have no leadership,"
5140 2018-03-06 15:08:39 "permitting for air and water issues" i.e. speeding up the process to allow offshore drilling? Helping oil and gas companies make money faster is not what taxpayers pay you to do, Mr. Pruitt. Please protect our environment!!!

5151 2018-03-06 15:07:18 It was no mistake, it was a planned strategy to gain access to rich oil fields and further destabilise the area, Gadaffi and Hussein were trying to get oil producers to work together, dump the dollar as the currency it is traded in etc.
5152 2018-03-06 15:07:14 Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser is talking energy transition during @CERAWeek. He says the future of oil is misunderstood. And he says there's not an either or future with electric vehicles, adding that EVs are moving emissions from tailpipe to smokestack.
5153 2018-03-06 15:07:13 @IngrahamAngle Let me think, who should I believe Paul Ryan saying that the tariffs are going to increase prices start a trade war or a president who gave us an abundance of oil. Hm

5171 2018-03-06 15:04:32 It doesn’t increase total emissions at all.  The entire world is hooked on oil.  It only changes the source and where revenues go.  And face it the Feds need all the revenue they can get!!

5275 2018-03-06 14:54:23 So true. Chaos deflects attention as cruel ICE raids increase, public lands are parcelled off and sold to Big Oil and Gas, pollution regs. are decimated, gun control efforts are pushed aside, and the #TrumpCrimeFamily grows wealthy again as it uses us to pay off its debts.

5283 2018-03-06 14:53:04 For decades, the US has paid the Arabs for their oil.  Now they're running out and we can tap into all the vast reserves we've found throughout the years.  We'll be the last ones with oil ... and the Arabs can choke on their sand.

5398 2018-03-06 14:43:14 "As I’ve said before it’s bizarre — and a sign of organizational incompetence — that #RNH might well go on the block this summer without team management knowing he can solve the issue on #McDavid’s wing." #DavidStaples #Word #ConnorMcDavid #RyanNugentHopkins #EdmontonOilers #Oil
5399 2018-03-06 14:43:06 It’s just the normal dangers of frying anything in your underwear. Sizzling sesame oil doesn’t feel good on your bare chest.
5400 2018-03-06 14:42:58 US are protecting IS, not fighting them. The Syrians would have finished IS off long ago. And regained their main oil wealth of course.

5412 2018-03-06 14:42:03 Right?  Especially when the owners of ET are all oil and gas company execs that invest most in House Reps for suburban districts on top of the Barnett Shale.  Surely it’s just a coincidence.

5416 2018-03-06 14:41:43 Trump’s tariffs are based on Section 232 of a 1962 U.S. law that allows safeguards based on “national security”.

Nixon and Ford used this law to tax foreign oil in 1971 and 1975. Section 232 has not been used since the WTO was created in 1995.

That's why it's a big deal
5417 2018-03-06 14:41:41 Toyotas are more made in America than a Dodge. If you want to help America buy a Tesla. You'll give American jobs & help keep our air clean & lessen our dependence on foreign oil

5420 2018-03-06 14:41:35 Most oil is not a thing to tweet-brag about.   It's a thing of the past.  Get with the times -- biggest producer of renewable energy would be impressive though.

5423 2018-03-06 14:41:24 If you think that prices will go down because we're producing our own oil you're going to wait a long time.

5432 2018-03-06 14:40:42 It is ALL about the oil sanctions. It always was and always will be about how much $$ @realDonaldTrump can make for him and his ilk. They don't even care about hiding it anymore.

5438 2018-03-06 14:39:54 A Britain where olive oil isn't available in supermarkets, but is only stocked by the chemist in small bottles for use as an exotic moisturiser.
5439 2018-03-06 14:39:46 Eyes her phone as a pleasant chime rings, studying and reviewing the 'reminder' several times. "Ooh right, I need to get more oil."
5440 2018-03-06 14:39:43 An unexpected perk to my CBD oil experiment is that I am losing my craving for coffee for some reason.
5441 2018-03-06 14:39:42 Oh and by the way 25% tariffs on steel will actually kill oil industry.
5442 2018-03-06 14:39:41 I made Rick Simpson oil myself. High THC content really helped with pain and nausea. Expensive though
5443 2018-03-06 14:39:41 Guess I’ll get a oil change when I get off Thursday
5444 2018-03-06 14:39:35 anyone looked at the trade?

US coulda been operating a trade surplus for 20y+.

The addiction to oil has prevented that.
Oil is the majority of our imports!
5445 2018-03-06 14:39:33 I've been burning the midnight oil for almost 3 weeks now. Travel goals kabahan na kayo hahaha In 3,2,1...

5447 2018-03-06 14:39:17 Exactly.  And there us no one in the State Department on this detail who speaks Russian. UNBELIEVABLE . Rex Tillerson Putin's oil buddy and American TRAITOR! Dereliction od duty. #LockRexUp

5452 2018-03-06 14:38:58 Oil! The future in energy.
5453 2018-03-06 14:38:56 Seems true. But does it hold if tech, trade, what ever is limiting classic inflation & thereby the CB reaction function? Before, oil could spike & kill the world without to much core CPI damage. Are there any "new" such variables other than oil?
5454 2018-03-06 14:38:52 I'm thinking we continue to cut off North Korea's supply of heating oil they will stop with the nuclear threats .

5462 2018-03-06 14:38:09 Pan is too big for 1 burger. Oil or butter will still dry out. First use a smaller pan. Second. Before putting oil in it (or butter) the pan must be really hot. Pour the oil wait 5 secs then put the burger. DONT move it around. The less you move it the better.
5463 2018-03-06 14:38:03 It doesn’t matter if the trade war results in tariffs that make selling oil impossible. Why do you think Vladimir directed Trump to tax steel and aluminum?
5464 2018-03-06 14:38:01 Be aware they are lumping natural gas liquids as oil. Eyeball refinery runs to see what's really happening: it's almost flat @staunovo

5534 2018-03-06 14:31:26 @Kopser4Congress keeps citing folks who work for Rice University (@cohan_ds & @MarkPJonesTX ). Rice's Chief Investment Officer is on Board of Black Stone Minerals, an Oil & Gas Mineral Rights company, and Rice is heavily invested. More Fracking = More $$.  Conflicts of interest!
5535 2018-03-06 14:31:13 #terrorism #oilandgas #SolarEnergy remember...by supporting oil rich countries, we also support terrorism from the oil producing countries...not a hard concept...
5536 2018-03-06 14:31:08 If we would do some investing in Renewables we could get off oil all that much quicker. But this President just put huge tariffs on panels so that he could shunt natural production of electricity through solar
5537 2018-03-06 14:31:03 You dunno if its the real Ibe now that's how you'll miss your share of the national oil.
5538 2018-03-06 14:30:55 I really hate eating fried chicken, KFC, Chicken Licken, Chicken Inn, Chicken Slice etc. I have had horrible experiences. The thought yekuti this chicken was cooked in oil older than Robert Mugabe no thank you.
5539 2018-03-06 14:30:49 You must have already forgot about the most recent folding that was close to home in OKC...and they were relatively competitive. Still need to put butts in the seats in friend.

5545 2018-03-06 14:30:21 It has helped me with sleeping issues and pain, of course. I do better with the oil. Basically, it takes time and trial and error to use cannabis. You have to find the THC/CBD balance that works best at different times of the day.

5547 2018-03-06 14:30:04 FYI, America has been the largest oil producer for a little while now.  The Bushes helped make that happen.

5551 2018-03-06 14:29:35 @lbc The one thing no one is talking about is the proliferation of Palm Oil/Fats, one of the worst trans fats you can put into food.  It is this that is really making people fat. Trans oils are bad but this is the worst and, it is dirt cheap to produce.
5552 2018-03-06 14:29:30 Donald, Donald, as someone who works in and actually understands the oil industry, the reason the US is pumping more is the rise in the oil price, which is courtesy of cuts imposed by Opec and Russia, you and your policies, I promise you, made absolutely no difference!
5553 2018-03-06 14:29:20 President Reagan loved the idea of being oil independent. Couple that with tax relief for both companies and individuals and I think Reagan would applaud @realDonaldTrump for his forward thinking.
5554 2018-03-06 14:29:05 Yes that would make him and his friends money though. Also the oil companies are huge donators to their party.

5589 2018-03-06 14:25:43 indeed, oil prices were as they were, and for transiting from the centrally planned into market economy there is a price to pay (we all went through this in CEE region). On Yeltsin achievements present dictator from 2000-2004 reformed taxt code, but then high oil prices 1/2

5592 2018-03-06 14:25:16 Or maybe instead of “big oil conspiracy theory” it’s more of a thrust to weight ratio thing?

5618 2018-03-06 14:22:57 Trump is going to piss off our major steel and aluminum exporters — not to mention major allies — like Canada, Japan, Germany, and Brazil — just to protect his major donors here in the USA. Crony capitalism and higher prices. But many will still buy the MAGA snake oil he sells.

5651 2018-03-06 14:19:41 I think it's more like Exxon and Russian installed tillerson.
When tillerson was CEO of Exxon, he was working (read, spending a lot of Exxon's money) to get oil contracts in Russia but then Obama put sanctions on Russia which stopped this from happening.
5652 2018-03-06 14:19:27 Yet, if US to become largest oil producer, it is also the world's largest consumer, mostly their military, and they buy most all their fuel from British Petroleum. Why?  Tell us more about this special relationship with Britton.

5672 2018-03-06 14:17:46 We could argue the point but for now, it seems to me, a choice between jobs and oil production reduction. Keep in mind the multiple other uses for oil. Chief among them is fertilizer. Oil is not going away anytime too soon. Unfortunately.

5729 2018-03-06 14:11:59 Your steel tariffs will take care of that. Plus oil is old why aren’t we invested in clean tech. Oh yeah because you don’t have any stock in it.

5731 2018-03-06 14:11:53 Being the world's largest oil producer is not necessarily a good thing. It would be much better if we were known as the largest user of renewable, sustainable energy. But you can explain that to all your heirs that inherit a dying planet.

5772 2018-03-06 14:09:04 An important point is the complexity of the system. If the global refinery system continues to run 30 API crude it would produce over 50% of the naphtha demand. This would leave 300kbpd of condensate to fill demand. It shows that there are many options not just shale oil

5805 2018-03-06 14:06:25 @SecretaryZinke your big oil money can’t buffer them from the environmental damage that WILL BE DONE. Have we learned nothing from the past?

5808 2018-03-06 14:06:15 Oil is a finite resource, internationally,  but it will be a medium term asset for the soon to be independent Scotland. It will more than compensate for the fictional subsidy provided by England.
5809 2018-03-06 14:06:07 my face: please i am secreting so much oil stop eating shitty food

5816 2018-03-06 14:05:46 I fear the security issue in that we're ONLY going to use foreign steel to build our TANKS & ONLY foreign aluminum to build our PLANES?  Eventually we no longer make steel or aluminum in America?  Big security risk as far as I am concerned. 
Just like the OIL shortages, remember?

5845 2018-03-06 14:02:35 I know the answer to my own question though.  Just like the NRA, the industries that control the resources don't want change or growth. Medical is happy with treatment not cure.  Oil companies won't allow other fuels to take their profits.  People vs. Corporations.

5850 2018-03-06 14:02:20 Besides the fact that @DRUDGE_REPORT is the epitome of FAKE A.F., Oil production is the worst type of “growing” we can do as a country. 
We need a president capable of understanding that the future lies in renewable energy.

5852 2018-03-06 14:01:56 For some years we been studying the emerge of investments in NAFTA, especially in US energy industry. We saw this big change coming early as 2010, but the major move came in Q4 2014 which impacted the oil price. What we are experiencing is a move from OPEC to alternatives.
5853 2018-03-06 14:01:52 Just had an awesome lunch.

5854 2018-03-06 14:01:47 SAD! Oil is Old.... USA should be the leader in CLEAN / RENEWABLE Energy. Fossil fuel is DEAD FUEL!
5855 2018-03-06 14:01:46 OK for 40 years WM has taken 92% of oil revenues as a population share.
Do you think England would ever accept a "deal" like that for its resources?
Woud scots be better off with 100% or with the 8%
you can see where Im going here cant you
5856 2018-03-06 14:01:26 Unsustainable.  Right.  I remember the textbooks that said the world would run out of oil by 2015.

They are set to get even poorer after brexit.  Thats why they need our oil, Whisky and all our our other exports.

Good luck Tom!  You will need it!!!! Hahahaha!

5866 2018-03-06 14:00:52 The western rivalry with iran (persia really) goes back 2500 years. This turn around it's all about oil, but that's only the latest. Keeping an islamic regime under boycott is much more profiatble than having a working social democracy raising oil prices ,,,,

5890 2018-03-06 13:59:31 Yes. Cannot establish INOC without reforming the oil ministry and redefining its role but no one is talking about that. But I suppose the logic is that IOCs' partners are the regional upstream companies, now owned by INOC, so by extension INOC is in charge of everything upstream

5907 2018-03-06 13:57:43 Wow, just like 50's in the western hills of PA. Nothing like waking up to the smell of oil in the morning.  As my grandfather would say "that's the smell of money".
5908 2018-03-06 13:57:39 Worlds largest dirty oil / dirty energy producer.

5910 2018-03-06 13:57:30 Cbd oil tastes so grim
5911 2018-03-06 13:57:24 No they’re not, they never attacked us, Soviet Union fell decades ago, the only reason politicians label them enemies is because they want to trade oil for gold instead of USD. Why do you think Gaddafi was killed by US backed rebel groups? He wanted to trade in gold, not USD.
5912 2018-03-06 13:57:21 You've heard of supply and demand, right? The price has stabilized and will fall as production increases. The demand for oil is rising as the world's economy continues to improve.
5913 2018-03-06 13:57:17 Lead me to salvation pour that oil please...
5914 2018-03-06 13:57:00 Thank you @Big_Orrin for helping us with these complex chemE issues! 

To summarize your conclusions: 

The naphtha bonus from LTO does not diminish the need to blend w/ heavier oil. 
Ethane is from natural gas & has nothing to do w/ LTO.

I always need help to understand!

5919 2018-03-06 13:56:39 Oil isolated from catnip by steam distillation is a repellent against insects, in particular mosquitoes and cockroaches . Research suggests that, while ten times more effective than DEET, it is not as effective as a repellent when compared with SS220. #catnip

5921 2018-03-06 13:56:30 I need an oil change
5922 2018-03-06 13:56:25 I do love how it always put on the coaches in the AHL. No question those guys are trying to win but if they are told to play x,y and z in said role by the organization, they will do it. Publicly teams preach the development piece but more often than not, those guys are still
5923 2018-03-06 13:56:23 Entirely a coincidence that the other day oil/gas production exceeded expectations.
5924 2018-03-06 13:56:22 Don't think that's safe. Soon in London, they will be limited to only cooking their chips in only certain types of oil. The club of nanny-state regulation knows no bounds.
5925 2018-03-06 13:56:22 @AmitShah 
But sometime we feel uncomfortable when we lacking in facts. I think there are few fronts where government need to take immediate action.
1. Control  the price of oil , I know crude oil rates are very high but comman men see the final put they said it was cheaper what
5926 2018-03-06 13:56:20 He has been cutting regulations soon as he walked in the White House! He allowed is much easier for companies & people to drill for oil. Its all on the WH website. Go check it out! you can read & see how this is possible.
5927 2018-03-06 13:56:19 If you exclude the few loud radical egos and paid talking heads, I expect there will be a high correlation between support for chaos and stock portfolios, oil, and arms, and irritation w immigrants and refuges. Most people little interested in ideals.

5932 2018-03-06 13:55:50 Interesting how an ex Russian spy and his daughter are allowed to be poisoned ....on British soil, with an unknown substance yet.. a sick child is refused  cannabis oil . 
The powers that be. 
Do what they want,

When it suits them 
WE. don't matter. 
5933 2018-03-06 13:55:49 Weren't they just negotiating for OPEC and everyone else to lower their production? It's like, hey we want you guys to lower your oil production to keep prices up, and now we're the biggest producer. WTF?

5974 2018-03-06 13:53:46 I have emailed them. I’m just trying to get my head around why a postman would still put this in his bag whilst covered in oil 
5975 2018-03-06 13:53:37 Congratulations! This Oil should be sold persistently. In banking & finance, a determined supply / whole calculations will be available. Around 36% of this Oil should be kept as reserve.
5976 2018-03-06 13:53:32 Ordering oil for my apartment be costing an arm and a leg. FML!
5977 2018-03-06 13:53:31 Coconut oil is so healthful, but I guess it's also a natural expectorant. I haven't put it in my coffee the last two mornings and haven't had my morning hack. Could it be?
5978 2018-03-06 13:53:28 and that is the issue. Be it the players they're drafting, their development or both, and I do think it is more of the former than latter, the misstep occurs well before they arrive in the NHL.

6080 2018-03-06 13:44:10 The fracking revolution began in 2008. The rebound in oil prices is responsible for surging production. Nothing else!

6083 2018-03-06 13:43:58 makes one think: who actually stood up for Scotland in those days? Labour were also unionist so it wasn't them - she was exploited for oil and utterly neglected
6084 2018-03-06 13:43:57 We dont want to be the worlds largest oil producer. We actually care about the environment unlike destructive donald. Your boy's lack of regard for scientific facts, the truth and our environment shows just how inept he really is. You guys suck!!!

6114 2018-03-06 13:41:29 Oil boom started in 2015, thanks obama!
6115 2018-03-06 13:41:25 We would have even more "sea critters" and JOBS if we drill for Gas and oil.

6117 2018-03-06 13:41:15 As early as 1870, Rockefeller acquired a monopoly for oil supply in the US with the Standard Oil Company and controlled 90% of total supply.
6118 2018-03-06 13:41:14 I've also discovered coconut butter which is like coconut oil, but without the flavour of the coconut. However it does run quite expensive.

6135 2018-03-06 13:39:25 Everybody needed oil at the time & it is not a debate it is one of the reasons.  If governments wished to apply Kipling's "East is East & West is West & never the twain shall meet" maxim, they should not have got involved in arms deals.  May has just cut a £100M deal with Turkey.
6136 2018-03-06 13:39:23 My friend who makes vegan bread uses coconut oil, she says you have to be careful because too much will add a bitter taste. Maybe you can use that in baking?

6139 2018-03-06 13:39:11 We don't need oil. We need alternative fuel options. Your quest to take us back to the 50s is moronic.
6140 2018-03-06 13:39:01 US must know elaborately on production-capacity & what are the establishments needed in the Oil Bazaar in Africa. Hence, a statement is needed on money. US gain will be available then. @FoxNews @CNN @washingtonpost
6141 2018-03-06 13:38:37 That’s because other countries are becoming less dependent on oil and are going to destroy the US by being proactive in alternative fuels.

6157 2018-03-06 13:36:25 America production increased significantly during the Obama administration, that is why America has a ten year oil reserve.

6159 2018-03-06 13:36:24 Tar sands (aka oil sands) is actually pretty cool. Historically, it was used for things like waterproofing canoes. 

What is scary is the extraction of oil from these deposits. There have been 373 spills since 2010. 

Large scale extraction = large scale spills!

6166 2018-03-06 13:35:23 The liberals? Helping the envoiroment? They both love oil.
6167 2018-03-06 13:35:14 One dude had a BMW with an oil leak. They told him he had to replace all the gaskets. Total came to be $15,000. Thankfully, he had the warranty. Only paid $850 lol.
6168 2018-03-06 13:35:13 While I'm at it, I'll mention that we farmed emus too. Same goes for them. Meat, leather, oil, feathers, eggs. All good stuff. Still have the original pair living on the farm at home. Is the problem that we are eating our national emblems? Or is it just a vegetarian objection?

6173 2018-03-06 13:34:56 Wonder how the oil and gas companies feel about that?  The companies that profit from natural gas work both BC and Alberta gas fields.  Pretty sure they don’t care what Kenny thinks.

6179 2018-03-06 13:32:37 So,  it took 4.5 billion years to produce all the oil on earth.  We have used half of it in 120 years..Now we are giddy we have figured out how to use it faster. Now thats one hell of a long term plan... Brilliant!
6180 2018-03-06 13:32:32 A country led by Socialists that our snowflakes need to look at to see what they are asking for.  Venezuela had all that oil and their leader promised to kill us.  I’ve boycotted any gas from that country for years.  Never give money to those that oppose you.
6181 2018-03-06 13:32:09 you dont think the rush to get to the oil had anything to do with it?
6182 2018-03-06 13:32:06 Nickel-$6.05, Aluminum-$0.97, Copper-$3.11, Molybdenum-$7.03, Oil-$62.57, CAD/USD- $1.2977, USD/CAD-$0.7706, TSX-$15,384.59, DJIA-$24,538.06

6183 2018-03-06 13:32:01 And how does this compare to being dependent on the US dollar to buy oil? 

Which then leads to the question about the 800+ US military bases around the world. Are they there to ensure dollar compliance?
6184 2018-03-06 13:31:52 Russia wanted sanction lifted to get the Exxon deal over 500 million to drill for oil. All about Ukraine and Crimea invasion. Hope Mueller links these thing up and bury TRUMP under the jail.
6185 2018-03-06 13:31:47 Why are they “stateless”? They left their home country without documents? Unlikely. Many have hidden documents to make it difficult for countries they illegally entered, to get evicted. Gosh, I’d like to sell you snake oil.

6188 2018-03-06 13:31:16 Wyoming...think some of that is through the Wyoming Conservation Alliance? They're all about oil and gas while not caring about the environmental impact and has received money from Colorado from a certain senator's wife.
6189 2018-03-06 13:31:12 The oil boom started long before you.
6190 2018-03-06 13:31:02 WTF!  Let me guess... oil and gas companies
6191 2018-03-06 13:30:59 thats because the rest of the world has dropped oil for renewables.. your destroying your country for the good old days.. they have long gone
6192 2018-03-06 13:30:58 OIL DIFF: 3.03 -> 3.03
6193 2018-03-06 13:30:57 That was some serious savagery. 
6194 2018-03-06 13:30:57 Some Trump supporters went after him during the election. Threatened his job with the War College. That experience affected him, I think, and his subsequent Tweets reflect this imo.
6195 2018-03-06 13:30:55 Oil...not “clean coal”....I guess you just need a WIN any way you can get it! 
6196 2018-03-06 13:30:49 Ignore that guess the add. It's Gastil oil  @Pulse1Radio
6197 2018-03-06 13:30:35 Mineral oil rigs are insane

6208 2018-03-06 13:29:26 Literally one of the only things that makes me so nervous about going to Iowa is having to find someone to change my oil there
6209 2018-03-06 13:29:15 @realDonaldTrump only someone desperate goes out and threatens or in this case blackmails me with Kim Juong and Oil and what else, oh yeah murder.

6214 2018-03-06 13:28:05 @BBCTalkback Why give Thatcher a statue. being the first woman PM does not whitewash her war against the working class from history. In my opinion she was a monster who had no special political acumen. She rode the back of the oil boom and financial deregulation like a queen.

6217 2018-03-06 13:27:47 Even with poor lifestyle and junk food, we still wouldn't need/don't need statins. They're dangerous junk in their own right, like old Wild-West "snake oil" but with monstrously more marketing energy and money to push people to take them.

6219 2018-03-06 13:27:27 Yah there are lots of things involved. But to the average mr Italy who lives in Rome, who’s now surrounded by people from another culture who don’t believe in western values, the oil debate is irrelevant

6223 2018-03-06 13:27:15 Not all men are mindful enough to
*Put gas in the car 
**Get oil changes 
***Wash the car

Don't have these false expectations of men.

6225 2018-03-06 13:27:13 Oil glut anyway.
6226 2018-03-06 13:27:04 Boom. Not a good thing #Trump . We should be offsetting our oil use with green energy but your short sighted plan is to go in a get the last drops. Regardless of the irrefutable damage it will cause. You're a Greed driven Idiot.
6227 2018-03-06 13:26:53 Dear Mr. Trump, please stop buying oil from Venezuela's Dictatorship. Don't worry about us, we already starving here. We need to take this criminals out from the power. #RT

6232 2018-03-06 13:26:36 Knowledge and education are the way to avoid people being ripped off. A chemist could use their training to spot snake oil.

The asset management industry relies on people who don't bother to understand fees & investment. That's why I warn people about fees all the time...
6233 2018-03-06 13:26:33 No talks, no food,oil or coal, until Kim and family leave. Now is the time to clean Truman's mess up.
6234 2018-03-06 13:26:12 Did anyone tell you yet that oil is going to be banned worldwide in 10 to 15 years?

How about preparing your country for what the future holds, instead of trying to ignore the future in favor of short term populism

Coal and oil

Come on!
6235 2018-03-06 13:26:06 @JayWeber3 A country that produces it's own Oil is a great country. The same with Iron, Steel, Aluminum, Copper and Nickle, etc. Wealth is not only measured in jobs and dollars.
I appreciate your point and your show.
6236 2018-03-06 13:26:04 Not only did Dad purchase 4 new tires for the Camry and get the oil changed, he also filled the car up with gas. #blessup #mydadisthebest

6238 2018-03-06 13:25:47 Saudi has nothing in common with the West yet they are besties... Simple, weapon deals and cheap oil.. it really doesn’t matter how democratic or incorrupt you are, it matters where their interest is... that’s why it’s naive to think of anyone as friend when it come to politics..
6239 2018-03-06 13:25:27 Bone marrow?
6240 2018-03-06 13:25:25 and when the oil runs out?  not so great.

6245 2018-03-06 13:24:43 Also, it's remarkable that the people fucking our future are still employed.  Pruitt is a fucking scum bag that would put his mother up for auction if there was oil in a blister on her ass.
6246 2018-03-06 13:24:40 baby oil 
6247 2018-03-06 13:24:40 After washing my hair, drying it and then straightening it with heat protectant I then put baby oil in my hair last night and now my hair literally feels so good

6252 2018-03-06 13:23:53 รองเท้าต้องโดน
6253 2018-03-06 13:23:47 Sebab mineral oil punya comedogenic rate dia tinggi so lagi senang pores nak tersumbat
6254 2018-03-06 13:23:44 Thanks to Obama’s policies requiring oil companies to drill or lose Public Land leases. They were sitting on leases.

Now hey’re drilling.

BOOM! Obama Oil!!!
Missing my $1.95/gal Obamagas though.
6255 2018-03-06 13:23:43 The world is far smaller & far more open than it was forty years ago.
It will get smaller still for some years, but at some point, international trade will have to find ways to deal with dwindling oil;  safe, nuclear powered ships will no doubt help and that could help trade grow
6256 2018-03-06 13:23:16 And so how are steel tariffs going to help the oil industry?
#ShutUpAndDoYourJob
6257 2018-03-06 13:23:16 I can make the dal, bot the pakwan. I don't deep fry stuff. Scared of the hot oil.
6258 2018-03-06 13:23:09 Putting the USA back...Renewables are the future, all cars will be electric and America struggling to keep up..no one will need oil..just like coal
6259 2018-03-06 13:23:06 Wow , thats great , as oil consumption hits record lows. How coal doing? Amateur
6260 2018-03-06 13:22:55 Ever since the Middle Eastern countries discovered oil the Western countries have allowed massive islamic investment in their countries.  Not to mention all the arms deals. Along with the dosh, comes the downside. No such thing as a free lunch.
6261 2018-03-06 13:22:54 No jobs - you've been lied to....AGAIN

They took the increase in oil company revenues & applied an #economic JOB FACTOR to it

This won't create #jobs any more than turning the valve fully open on a lawn sprinkler would.

@MarieQuantier @paulkrugman #fossilfuels @DRUDGE_REPORT
6262 2018-03-06 13:22:46 Because we all know that oil is the future. Very much like how coal is the future.
6263 2018-03-06 13:22:37 If you want jobs and security, you should be supporting clean energy, not oil and coal.

6267 2018-03-06 13:21:38 Tillerson was a successful CEO of Exxon, who was partnering with Russia to drill on new massive oil fields befor sanctions stopped him. Suddenly he steps down to be SOS for Trump.  His sole purpose was to get sanctions lifted, help Exxon get first advantage, and enrich him & DT!
6268 2018-03-06 13:21:33 1. Drudge report: fake news conspiracy site. 2. Big oil in USA is something to be ashamed of, not proud of. The sooner we stop relying on fossil fuels the better. 3. You are loathsome, and scare children, animals, and most adults. Please buy an island and move there, permanently.

6279 2018-03-06 13:20:29 Might just need a gasket. German cars are known for leaking oil
6280 2018-03-06 13:20:16 When #Trump talks about more gun control, it's just so much snake oil.
6281 2018-03-06 13:20:14 WM hid scots wealth then decided 8% was "fair" then proceeded to near bankrupt an oil rich UK,,as much oil as Norway who are one of the worlds richest countries
let that sink in
westminster near bankrupted an oil rich country
and you are shocked scots want to leave!
6282 2018-03-06 13:20:11 United states to become world's largest oil producer by 2023!!!!! When will india fully extract its own hydrocarbon deposits ? @narendramodi
6283 2018-03-06 13:20:09 So they went out and preached that people should repent. And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.

6284 2018-03-06 13:20:06 Snake oil looks better next to the blue tone of the scrubs.
6285 2018-03-06 13:19:59 Just the same as he is responsible for North and South Korea talking, as oil production, same as Charlotte
6286 2018-03-06 13:19:55 It's well past time we stopped using oil as an important energy source.
6287 2018-03-06 13:19:45 おいしかったよ(՞ټ՞
6288 2018-03-06 13:19:40 Is he fucking serious? Oh no, where else could be oil from, surely no one else in the world but Alberta produces and sells it!!
6289 2018-03-06 13:19:36 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

6293 2018-03-06 13:19:08 I'm in the heartland $$ not everything. We need not be dependent on foreign sources for essential commodities. Why we got embroiled in ME mess, dependence on foreign oil, easy history lesson we're still embroiled. What price security, freedom?

6295 2018-03-06 13:18:56 They must need fuel and food. This is part of the cycle. They ask for talks, then agree to stop their nuclear program in exchange for food and oil. Things calm down for awhile and then the cycle begins again
6296 2018-03-06 13:18:48 Im so excited!! Can't wait to see both of you!!
6297 2018-03-06 13:18:40 There are better alternatives to oil we should be investing in. Many more jobs, cleaner technology. Why wouldn't you? Oh right, you've been bought by the oil lobby...

6301 2018-03-06 13:18:25 If we really want to commemorate what saved the UK economy in the 80s we should have two statues - one of North Sea Oil and one of EEC membership.

6310 2018-03-06 13:17:33 Rebranding bitumen as oil is good marketing but it doesn’t change it from bitumen to oil. Upgrading does that but for some reason upgrading is not happening in Alberta.
6311 2018-03-06 13:17:31 Same with fish oil. Its much more expensive prescribed because of the purity. Its not all the same. Just because something says 1000 MG on two bottles of the same type of medicine one may be more expensive do to the fact of purity in the formula.
6312 2018-03-06 13:17:27 1- Oil is NOT priced in CNY.  oil is priced in US dollar then the value converted to CNY or any other currency. 
2- We, in the academic literature, never looked at OPEC as one unit, never.
6313 2018-03-06 13:17:25 P.S. there is still oil from deep water horizon in our waters. Still wreaking havoc

6319 2018-03-06 13:16:51 Obviously, you were not paying attention to what happened to the industry in the past several years when they oil industry began producing more by fracking.

6327 2018-03-06 13:16:19 President Trump is making the United States the greatest nation in the world! We are becoming independent from Obama's Muslim Brotherhood oil producers!
6328 2018-03-06 13:16:07 That is bad.
Haven't you figured out oil and coal are destroyers of our environment?
This is the future of our world. 
If we continue to pour this pollution into our air, we are going to die.
There is no such thing as clean coal.
All coal is dirty.
6329 2018-03-06 13:16:03 Wait. USA to be the world's largest oil producer...are you going to invade yourselves in a couple of years? 
6330 2018-03-06 13:15:59 I need to get it and get an oil change.
6331 2018-03-06 13:15:56 I dont think so but in general They just dont want bigger fish come and build. Besides somaliland could build lughaya to cover local market. If there is oil to be found in SL we suppse to export it from lughaya
6332 2018-03-06 13:15:49 The USA don't "produce" oil - they simply don't exist long enough to do that (the same's true for any other country, btw). What you dou - you put some carbon that was hidden safely some miles down back into atmosphere - and that's really nothing to write home about ...
6333 2018-03-06 13:15:37 Why did this person drink oil raw?
6334 2018-03-06 13:15:36 So actually our national security is threatened by the oil industry for many reasons, like climate change. You should do something about that - encourage jobs in green industries!!!
6335 2018-03-06 13:15:28 Don't believe what Putin tells you. Russia is not the world's largest oil producer.

6343 2018-03-06 13:14:34 Ever flown in a jet powered by “renewable energy”? How many things do you own or use that are made with plastics that need oil in their manufacturing? Why not take an “all of the above” approach until the free market chooses more renewable energy naturally?
6344 2018-03-06 13:14:30 a healthy snack should have fruits or vegetable in it and dapat less oil.
6345 2018-03-06 13:14:28 The sickening thing is that this turn in oil production & energy independence is viewed as a bad thing by the left, and if Democrats ever get back in power, they will stop at nothing to reverse it.

6354 2018-03-06 13:13:33 The trade deal will not happen, workers in the US get paid more than Mexico, The US need a lot off oil as nearly every citizen like to drive fuel guzzler, no control on water fuel or energy, if every country do like the US we will consume the plant with in a few years.

6361 2018-03-06 13:13:08 We are behind the rest of the world in clean energy and you continue to erode environmental protections to make Big Oil happy! You do nothing that benefits or moves our country forward! You cater to whatever will fill your pocket!
6362 2018-03-06 13:13:05 Oil won't do us any good if we don't have steel and aluminum to manufacture the parts needed for retrieval.

6364 2018-03-06 13:12:51 Dont add oil to the fire...
6365 2018-03-06 13:12:50 No. We’ve been falling behind while waiting for renewable energy to become efficient and cost effective. We’ve also subsidized most of the research and development of Green Energy. Meanwhile, we’ve been relying on foreign oil.

6367 2018-03-06 13:12:38 @AriMelber was apparently burning the midnight oil and, regardless, up early today.
6368 2018-03-06 13:12:24 A**wipe your selling off National preserves, sites, parks to the highest oil producers who are sliding $$ into your offshore accts.  Your destroying our country for very FEW jobs.   Your already the worse President in our country's history.

6374 2018-03-06 13:11:51 The only problem is that the legislators are owned by the oil companies and care more about lining their own pockets than doing what is best for the state.
6375 2018-03-06 13:11:51 Actually the world needs to move away from dirty fossil fuels ASAP. Being #1 producer of oil is no great achievement. #AlGoreWasRight #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateAction #RenewableEnergy

6383 2018-03-06 13:11:18 Thanks Obama for the massive increase in oil production on his watch.

The EIA makes it clear you're benefiting from Obama's oil rush.
6384 2018-03-06 13:11:18 Oil is soooooo last century. When is our govt going to get it into their heads? Clean fuels and renewable energy are the future. Oil can go suck it.
6385 2018-03-06 13:11:13 Other countries are going to renewable energy so of course we will be the largest oil producer & the largest polluter of our planet.

6396 2018-03-06 13:10:07 Oil production grew under Obama. But the biggest threat to national security is #climatechange as a result of burning fossil fuels.
6397 2018-03-06 13:10:07 Staying reliant on oil is not a form of security. Only cavemen think this way.

6402 2018-03-06 13:09:57 That is absolutely a failure on your part and more oil is nothing to be proud of.

6422 2018-03-06 13:08:32 But whilst you’re on that amazing seam of logic, please expand by what you mean as access?
Do you think an Indy Scotland outside of the EU would extract and keep the oil and gas all by and for itself?
Would we neither sell rights to it nor export it? 
Define access or lack of?

6435 2018-03-06 13:07:27 Were I to run against you in 2020, I would demand that big oil and gas come up with viable clean renewable energy by 2022 or face heavy fines.  (We are relying on a finite resource and over 100 yr old technology.)  Guaranteed they would  do it and do it well.

6440 2018-03-06 13:07:14 Yes, and the less money they get to spend on military, propaganda and intelligence agencies through other countries buying their oil and gas, the less effective those military, propaganda and intelligence agencies will be.

6452 2018-03-06 13:06:23 Yes! The only very dark cloud in this picture is that oil producers need a lot of steel, and the #TrumpTariffs will  raise steel prices 25%. Will production slack off because of the #TrumpTariffs?

6457 2018-03-06 13:06:00 We’ve been the biggest oil producer for sometime now. Opening drilling in Alaska and off the coast of the US isn’t smart, it’s environmental a disaster. Oil and gas is cheap, we don’t need the risks.
6458 2018-03-06 13:05:56 Where the snake oil comes in, is the fact that rewards to intermediaries vs pension savers are so temporally disconnected. It leaves savers vulnerable because there are such immediate rewards  for the shady or simply over-confident "adviser".

6495 2018-03-06 13:02:49 (10/10)
The reason being the fact that high tech industries are located predominantly in states with strong democrats control, lower tech ones like basic metals, oil and coal are in predominantly republican states.

6526 2018-03-06 12:59:02 I thought it was a given since the whole mess started with the Rosneft oil deal brokered by none other than Rex Tillerson.
The Ukraine invasion that sparked the first sanctions was to secure a free route for the oil. Then Exxon was out and Putin didn't have the equipment to drill
6527 2018-03-06 12:58:55 maybe they should stop flaring-off at Grangemouth and oil rigs? could it not be collected instead?

6536 2018-03-06 12:57:18 anybody know where i should get my oil changed for an okay price bc last time i did it at walmart and they messed my car up lol
6537 2018-03-06 12:57:08 While I bet we don't agree on much. I preach this very same strategy to people all the time. Strategically it makes no sense to use our oil supply right now.
6538 2018-03-06 12:57:01 He still needs to work on other parts of his game. Once 6 is ready to play I would send him down asap to help Bake w/their playoff push. Let him start next yr in the minors and be at the ready when the Oil make changes to their D. I don't think you can just pencil him in next yr.
6539 2018-03-06 12:56:45 I agree the cold war antics are irrelevant. However solar has its problems. It is extremely toxic to produce reuse and recycle. Not cost efficient compared to oil. Obama admin did not have the environmental consequences at heart, not sure of his motivations for the tariffs.

6542 2018-03-06 12:56:37 As someone who has witnessed the oil contamination for the last 3 weeks I’ve personally witnessed the struggle to contain it & would argue it’s been drastically under reported
6543 2018-03-06 12:56:23 I guess the importance of oil and its multiple uses besides as a fuel eludes you. Try living in a world without it.

6566 2018-03-06 12:53:50 On @CNBCWEX @KilduffReport said openly-traded options contracts on oil worked against both oil companies and OPEC.

So why isn't there an option market for a standardized steel commodity  contract?

@jonnajarian @petenajarian
6567 2018-03-06 12:53:38 US oil production shouldn't be about competing with Russia. That's 20th century thinking. Let's support the creation of other sources of energy to better our country and the world.

6575 2018-03-06 12:52:01 I just hope that much of that oil supply is not realised. Otherwise a carbon-neutral mid-century economy may be out of reach.

6643 2018-03-06 12:42:05 The govt of #SouthSudan has denied allegations that its leadership is channelling millions of dollars of oil money to fund the ongoing 4-year civil war. Allegations were contained in an investigation by Global witness.
6644 2018-03-06 12:42:01 United have TWO EPL record signings. That in conjunction with your excessive wage bill & your debt ridden club, & your club’s own ties with oil money, you really shouldn’t be talking. Mind you, I’m from Chorlton, thus invalidating every comment you pass about glory hunting.

6928 2018-03-06 11:59:06 By 2023 we will be the worlds biggest producer of oil only drilling on 10% of land. @henrymcmaster doesn’t want that though.

6932 2018-03-06 11:58:41 BC has no right to block pipelines that are NEB approved. Rail? Even less.Imagine the lawsuit from CN if BC tried to tell CN they were not allowed to ship oil? The BC NDP would crawl under a rock and never come out.

6937 2018-03-06 11:58:10 As for currency, we can't rely on the pound. It lost 20% of its value due to Brexit intentions and hasn't recovered. It would likely do the same after Indy (since the market knows its value from oil). So the best plan would be to transition to using something else less volatile.

Venezuela has never tried MMT it ran out of $ because of an oil buyers strike.

7011 2018-03-06 11:45:41 It is important to stress that the focus of Nigerian Content is not about ‘Nigerianisation’ of the oil and gas sector, but rather domiciliation’ and ‘domestication’ of value-adding activities in-country. Engr. Wabote Simbi @wabote_simbi

7079 2018-03-06 11:33:01 I’m just about to change electricity supplier for home. The price gap between renewable lecky and oil/coal/gas is much narrower than three years ago. Test drove @renault_uk Zoe recently. Zero emissions is feasible for say half of mileage.
7080 2018-03-06 11:32:54 Intermittents currently scale easier than Diesel coal or oil. Small wind mills and batteries were used in small farms before grids and pole electricity distribution in British Isles as late as 1960! The treatment for cholera in 3rd world relies on cheap products to hand!

7139 2018-03-06 11:19:52 back to my point --- Supply of Dollars has increased due to Foreign portfolio investment and trade surplus which is on the back of a rise in oil prices. If oil prices crash again those investments will be sold of which in turn will increase demand for dollars thus lower reserves

7175 2018-03-06 11:12:32 Why do all scenarios include negative emissions? Is BECCs more efficient than leaving the oil/gas under the ground? At least Norway has no plans of stopping oil drilling anytime soon. There is no way CO2 will peak already in 2020...These scenarios seem like wishful thinking?

U.K. can set on both & cause more damage

“PSG kissing up to the fans, they must be desperate”
7267 2018-03-06 10:52:11 As regards most other rainforest and biodiverse areas, it is indeed livestock grazing and their crops (particularly soya) that drives deforestation. Indonesia, in general however is predominantly flattened for the palm oil we eat every day.

7295 2018-03-06 10:43:49 So not only is Saudi cutting production substantially, they’re buying oil on the market? Why wouldn’t they buy Brent and short WTI if they were doing this to keep shales somewhat at bay?  I’m skeptical. Would more bet it’s PRC or India, hedging future needs against OPEC cuts.

7321 2018-03-06 10:39:27 The oil is so beneficial.  I have suffered with migraines for years and now I don't have them. I'm more energetic and focused. It has also given me the opportunity to help others and make extra income
7322 2018-03-06 10:39:07 "Coffee puts a little fuel in your tank but adding oil could put you into overdrive. That's ahead in today's medical headlines." We're getting there!
7323 2018-03-06 10:39:05 The assumption is that LTO is going to be demanded because a graph says it will. The problem is that, there is much more complexity in the oil market than the shale narrative suggests.

7330 2018-03-06 10:37:15 Truth be said Nigeria was always a fall back market for US oil as their primary source was Saudi Arabia. And with the way the world is going it's high time we look at alternatives away from oil. Eg China to the approach of becoming the world's production factory

7392 2018-03-06 10:22:15 Let's face it. Big Oil and Bay Street billionaires want 2 things: minimal action on climate and protection for their tax shelter scams. Lib-Cons consistently deliver on those two issues. Cons aren't really the opposition - they're the other side of the same Lib-Con coin.

7418 2018-03-06 10:17:56 Reducing the take from Jane's article to 'Vlad v Mitt' (because Mitt said somethin mean about Vlad) is as thick as reducing the preference for Trump (& GOP agenda) to 'Hillary hate' motivated by vanity (and Rex to an afterthought, unrelated to oil). #conflictminerals #ParisAccord

Post #Iraq the problem right thru beyond 2007 was the Iraq Govt refused to "hand over" its oil fields to the West in privatisation for eg. Hence the "Sunni" killings.

7424 2018-03-06 10:16:57 The difference between Bush/Obama vs Trump is that Trump brought the hatred and animosity you happily gave to the Middle East during their ‘liberation’ back to America.

7493 2018-03-06 10:02:03 Do you eat a balanced diet Eric? Enough lean protein, vegetables & good fats from olive oil, avocado, seeds, nuts & dairy? A highly processed diet of bread, cereals, pasta, etc. could be dragging you down. Stay hydrated with enough water. Coffee/tea are fine.
7494 2018-03-06 10:01:43 this spill is becoming EERILY similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up, we won't build another OIL RIG.
7495 2018-03-06 10:01:27 I have had heating oil delivered after two cold weeks. I have set the thermostat to 35 and removed my trousers in celebration.
7496 2018-03-06 10:01:16 have you or your friend rented any oil heater recently?

7508 2018-03-06 09:57:30 This whole tariff thing and putin using trump to disrupt the world money is from the imminent demise of big oil.

7510 2018-03-06 09:56:56 Thank you Art. Very good outlook. Petrochemicals still the most volume absorbing of oil downstream .. years to be replaced..

7514 2018-03-06 09:56:08 At the beginning of Bonn' s Aerial Surveillance flight crews were seeing 2.8 oil spills per hour of surveillance flight. Now there is less than one detection per 30h. Quite an improvement! @osparcomm

7519 2018-03-06 09:55:22 Oil stopped. Me to screwed in pel. But will hold
7520 2018-03-06 09:55:08 Most of the Ethane demand will be covered by Natural gas/LNG's. Naphtha will be not only covered just by US tight oil but also new streams of light crude coming online in Kuwait, Iran, Australia etc.
7521 2018-03-06 09:55:08 Change came from leadership - politically by PM Whitlam, activism by Foley, Mansell et al, pop culture by bands like Midnight Oil, Warumpi, Coloured Stone, Kev Carmody, Yothu Yindi etc. Most white Australians changed their views & language. But then the ‘history wars’ began.

7523 2018-03-06 09:55:06 @SpeakerRyan @CanadianPM  Canada can withhold water,electricity, oil and gas lumber etc. in order to shorten this destructive temper tantrum. We will be urging our Prime Minister to stand up for Canadians first. He will do the right thing.

7534 2018-03-06 09:53:47 maybe with a dash of chili infused oil on top?

7538 2018-03-06 09:53:20 I see where you're going with this, but point of correction: the rapid modernisation of Dubai started in the 60s after the discovery of oil there. 10-15 years ago Dubai was already highly technology avadnced and infrascturally developed and a major tourist hub.

7574 2018-03-06 09:44:44 Is baby oil still available? I used to use this though it being several years ago I've no idea if its been discontinued/since been proven to melt your eyeballs or something equally terrifying.
7575 2018-03-06 09:44:38 I'd love to make some oil for my dad out of this stuff!
7576 2018-03-06 09:44:34 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.

7589 2018-03-06 09:42:04 You use high explosives to put out oil fires. The blast blows out the fire. ( or the low pressure zone behind the blast, don’t know exactly.)
7590 2018-03-06 09:42:00 Wanting to make your fried eggs taste better? Why not add some olive oil to it? The low smoke point of olive oil causes it heat up quickly on the pan which makes the white crispy and the yolk as it is. Not only will this make it tastier but also healthier.

7592 2018-03-06 09:41:56 Burnaby will be forced to allow the line. Accept the facts. I do believe your fuel price is up as your refinery is down for maintenance. The refinery that receives oil from the existing Kinder Morgan line from Alberta.

7607 2018-03-06 09:38:58 เอ้าาาาาา น่าหนักใจเลยว่ะ
7608 2018-03-06 09:38:50 It’s quite sad man. This country is actually a slow motion car crash, population growing fast + oil heading for coal status in the next few decades (maybe sooner).We should be in crisis mode right now but govt is just carrying on as if it’s all good.
7609 2018-03-06 09:38:22 I'm gonna let you into a secret. The Saudis funded 9/11 and most of the people who did it were from Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are not really your friends but you are just locked together through oil in dollar purchases.
7610 2018-03-06 09:37:58 In the UK a series has just started about the "secret" medical cannabis oil scene and is hosted by a man who publicly detests cannabis smokers. He hosts another show similar to Jerry Springer. He has now stated that he would give his child cannabis oil if he was sick.

7615 2018-03-06 09:36:41 Vitamin e oil, Aloe Vera gel or lemon. Those are what I can think of off the top of my head
7616 2018-03-06 09:36:28 Have you ever heard the term 'Snake Oil Salesman'
7617 2018-03-06 09:36:13 Sure, but terrorism performed by foreigners (at least in the US) can pretty much all be traced to the US blowing up a country for oil.
That's not to say religion doesn't perpetuate it, but it could certainly be mediated if we stopped blowing shit up everywhere.
7618 2018-03-06 09:36:04 OILさんは欲望に忠実だな…(褒めてる)
7619 2018-03-06 09:35:39 Definitely. People in some parts of the Med consume 50l of olive oil per capita per year. They live long, healthy lives. If you ate 50kg of butter a year - supposedly equivalent calories - you'd be dead.
7620 2018-03-06 09:35:29 One note on water-in-oil though - to be very dynamic, the droplets have to float, so you would want to use oils with a density of more than water, such as diethylphthalate, one of our oils
7621 2018-03-06 09:34:53 A purifying facial mask, bright indigo, with concord grape, tea tree oil, and exfoliating Spanish rock salt. It's a hard chunk.
7622 2018-03-06 09:34:36 Proverbs 5:3-4 For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey, And her mouth [is] smoother than oil; But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. #MDP #treskaroway
7623 2018-03-06 09:34:32 ‘Some’ Scots want independence and the numbers are falling all the time. Not wrong to want it, but you need to look at the true consequences, not bullshit fed to you on a daily basis.  I’ve already answered the oil question you’re obsessed with. There is ZERO money for anyone now
7624 2018-03-06 09:34:27 おー了解！みすみくん優先で描くぞー！
7625 2018-03-06 09:34:07 Oh my cars asking me for an oil change now too okay.
7626 2018-03-06 09:34:00 So reversing the phases to be water-in-oil droplets will certainly have a huge effect - but I suspect a lot of interesting behaviours will still be seen!

7630 2018-03-06 09:33:31 We already know from our work that a tiny change in the oil recipe (eg +1% of a component) can completely change the dynamics of the droplets - they may go from moving fast to dividing into many small droplets!
7631 2018-03-06 09:33:19 Something similar is @WaxLiquidizer. It turns it into an oil, marketed for vape but can't see why you couldn't use as edible.

7634 2018-03-06 09:32:42 We have manage to test it on 3 kg scale of biomass. In the case of birch you will get around 0.5 kg bio oil and may be 200-300 grams will be monomeric compounds. We are in the process of going to pilot setup.

7637 2018-03-06 09:31:52 Ok some answers please
1)Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
2) Do you think scots would be better off with the 8% of oil and gas revenues we get from WM or 100%?
I look forward to your answers Mr Loin

I'm sure this has already been considered, just wondered why it's not being done ?

7805 2018-03-06 08:57:16 Wrong answer! The problem with humous & coleslaw isn’t quantity, it’s quality. Food manufacturer’s margins come from replacing quality ingredients like olive oil (easy to metabolise) with cheap ingredients like palm oil (harder to metabolise & so gets stored as fat) #R4today

7831 2018-03-06 08:53:40 It’s been 10 years since the car consumer market moved away from oil guzzlers because of the commodity boom. Now the biggest sellers are large pickup trucks.

7839 2018-03-06 08:51:41 Might see if cannabis oil can cure my bank account
7840 2018-03-06 08:51:29 I see nice things too, but I've also seen what the oil sands is doing. I've seen what economy is doing. People are very comfortable in not acting upon it and providing the same narrative of things like "well the earth will survive without humans." 

As if we can't kill it.

7842 2018-03-06 08:51:22 Carbon capture has a strong lobby because it is a cashcow for the oil and gas industry. In the EU burning biomass is currently counted as CO2 neutral even though the net CO2 balance is actually much worse than burning gas for the next 40/50 years and leads to deforestation.

7845 2018-03-06 08:51:00 Cannabis oil
7846 2018-03-06 08:50:38 Yes, but there's many types. Think more like actual oil. The black crude stuff. It's a mix of hundreds of different types of oil. Petrol, diesel, kerosene, plastics etc... All different.
And like a car, your body needs certain oils, certain fats. And doesn't want others.

7858 2018-03-06 08:47:28 Whale oil was used in the past but when whales become rarer, the market started changing to oil (also with some political and social influences.)

7912 2018-03-06 08:36:04 Obviously your reasoning makes sound logic. Actually others said Nigeria Army had a lot of assistance from outside world to protect the source of cheap oil of a new country akin what’s happening in S/Sudan today. Also right that we are bedeviled with lack of intelligence today
7913 2018-03-06 08:35:46 As a nation we are addicted to two things - sugar and oil. Both equally damaging to our health and well being. But just like the NRA in the US we are in the pay of both industries. And we don’t have the political will to challenge either.

7915 2018-03-06 08:35:27 Snake oil salesmen like Morrow will say anything to get their big bonuses.
7916 2018-03-06 08:35:22 Hi Erin, I watched your video on how to stop bar chewing. I put some olive oil on the bars and my little dwarf actually liked it! I have a weird hamster... I love your video's!
7917 2018-03-06 08:34:55 Yeah it isn't too difficult to see the war machine always gets fed when America is nothing but an oil company with a military but they know the exact timing & it doesn't happen until they make deals to fuck over the people for their donors.
7918 2018-03-06 08:34:24 Sounds like a lame excuse to me mate. United's 'unlimited funds' have come from being very successful, due to our youth system! Year after year they turn over more money than any other club. It's not like City and Chelsea where it's dirty oil money!

7922 2018-03-06 08:33:45 Yeah - sure. Leave the fans - designed for air - immersed in the mineral oil. Longer life span.  (clapping with hand on forehead)
7923 2018-03-06 08:33:45 Blimey, you talk bollocks don’t you (like most Nats). So nothing to do with global oil prices falling, the oil is becoming increasingly more difficult to extract making it more expensive with less profit & you were brainwashed by @AlexSalmond’s lies about oil revenues. 
7924 2018-03-06 08:33:36 No new idea by govt we have tolled the same line since then, 'milk the crude oil and our brains remained blank' even got worse the only refinery we have/had was built way back then, isn't that enough to show we are declining sir
7925 2018-03-06 08:33:23 no i use it with the honey and sugar sometimes for extra softness just like the olive oil!
7926 2018-03-06 08:32:18 Go back to your broadcast about the Russian Oil Fields.  You exposed the core of what all this crap is about.  The rest is just Trump flailing like a carp that jumped into a boat by accident

7928 2018-03-06 08:31:48 Oil management is 200% a WM issue. Uncomfortable truth is how much it shoukd be worth. You never see a comparison with Norway on British news or newspapers for that reason.

7933 2018-03-06 08:30:40 You are aware Norway makes £20b a year from less oil and UK govt make close to nothing as has sweet heart deals with oil companies. If Scot simply does what Norway does with less oil they would be a very rich country. Scot budget is £30b or so and an extra 60% revenue would help!
7934 2018-03-06 08:30:38 Once they turned out Standard Oil. They're just a bit of the right on the ones who are not know how to roasting.
7935 2018-03-06 08:30:32 @OC worst smell ever was a tour of a cod liver oil factory in the Lofoten Islands Norway. You could smell the factory from half a mile away, but inside was horrendous. People ran outside to honk up

7993 2018-03-06 08:15:34 @billtu so sorry to hear about your diagnosis Bill. I'm writing to recommend you use some CBD oil, which is available from Holland and Barrett. This starves cancer cells and also reduces nausea from other treatments.

8007 2018-03-06 08:13:55 But for how long was this not the case? How long did you know your palm oil production was destroying the natural world but kept silent? What are you actively doing to rectify a huge problem you are partly to blame for with your choice if ingredient? Do you have to use palm oil?

It's like what happened in China with the great leap forward
8189 2018-03-06 07:35:27 Canadian DOLLAR was losing, GBP/CAD gained 180 PIPS, EUR/CAD 160. CRUDE OIL was moving higher again, WTI is now traded at 62.60 USD per barrel.
8190 2018-03-06 07:35:17 UK Gov issued a press release boasting about an oil boom. Shetland Isles is part of Scotland and if the Shetland Isles were independent, its continental wouldn't extend very far. There were no Chinese deals on table, just possibility of a meeting about potential of future deals.
8191 2018-03-06 07:35:15 England as not been very successful in the ways of freedom fighting,as for  invading sovereign nations killing millions,and stealing land oil and natural resources, their very good at that,
8192 2018-03-06 07:35:10 The best art, whether it's oil on canvas, words on paper, or images onscreen, always leaves us wanting more.

8200 2018-03-06 07:33:53 ......the anti-dote should be the ideology of Tory austerity that has condemned a new generation to such low aspirational horizons. The infections are now so strong that staunch remainer May's medicine show can sell them the snake oil balm of Brexit!
8201 2018-03-06 07:33:38 USA doesn't have enough oil to be the biggest producer.  More lies.
8202 2018-03-06 07:33:24 Did we have the same grand parents. That hot oil treatment was THE THRUTH!

8204 2018-03-06 07:32:49 Anambra traders are deadly. Bread that has lasted for 2 weeks, they'll now rub oil all over it so that it'll be soft. 

Fresh bread...
8205 2018-03-06 07:32:29 Not even snake oil. More like just an empty bottle.

8208 2018-03-06 07:31:43 I’m giving myself a hot oil treatment @ 1:30 ina morning.. that’s what happen when you ain’t got no man

8214 2018-03-06 07:29:58 Sir, might I remind you that our FX reserves are at a climbing $40bn dollars? Baba inherited an ebbing $20bn even when oil was $100+ PB. So much for “body language, poor economic policy and interference with MP.
8215 2018-03-06 07:29:29 Why were the oil drums only painted red on one side?......Oh yeah, he said, he doesn't have much money.
8216 2018-03-06 07:29:11 Quick reminder to people... if you are cooking, with oil, open the windows or at least move your coat out of the kitchen. Please. Or don’t wear that same coat on the train/tube.. it’s so horrendous. 
8217 2018-03-06 07:29:04 He is right and for the critics, his towers, hotels etc were built with steel and concrete He knows that industry and what his actions would cost American builders and businesses! Trust a business man with this issue more than some snake oil salesman politician or  pundits!

8237 2018-03-06 07:25:26 @realDonaldTrump Canada is a tiny economy compared to the US.  There will always be a trade deficit because we supply the US with all your cheap raw resources, lumber, power, oil, gas, mining etc.  The US benefits greatly from direct access with no tariffs...

8253 2018-03-06 07:22:13 Apart from the fact that Israel helps terrorists that invade these countries. Has ISIS ever attacked Israel?

8264 2018-03-06 07:19:34 do agree that it could be more healthier than added with tobacco or even burning the plant which is useless, 
only the crystals has the drug, but oil and ingestion is still the safests way.
the vaporizer would also stop the pressurising of the lungs too...

8332 2018-03-06 07:06:18 here's how my grocery runs go 
walmart 
- oatmeal, eggs, greek yogurt, soy milk, any fruit, veggies, olive oil,

8334 2018-03-06 07:05:48 One of my old church leaders commented “Waaa!” on an article about oil being the motive for shrinking Bears Ears. I was tempted to reply, but instead I promptly deleted his comment. 

All I can think of right now is how writing “waaa” as if I was crying about was the best he had.

8342 2018-03-06 07:04:07 Saudis use OPEC to manipulate the international oil markets - when it looks like we are going independent- they pump more and sell at far below market value - this stops our exploration - dries up capital - and when they think we have been hurt enough - they raise prices sky high
8343 2018-03-06 07:04:07 I suspect it’s willful ignorance on Pruitt’s part in service to his oil and gas overloads. Giving things a religious gloss never hurts in troglodyte OK.

8347 2018-03-06 07:02:59 I spent my evening using a pipette to add drops of tea tree oil to various skincare products.
8348 2018-03-06 07:02:41 I’ve been using tea tree oil for breakouts and it helps get rid of them faster I’ve noticed but honestly I just need a new face at this point cuz I have hella acne scars lol

8350 2018-03-06 07:02:00 I’d love to use The Bianca Remover to take off the 30lbs of makeup I wear daily except I’m intensely allergic to coconut oil and I’m not trying to remove my actual face here #whoneedsaface @TheBiancaDelRio

8358 2018-03-06 07:01:07 Who going to be the most turnt during the oil spill is the real question 
8359 2018-03-06 07:01:07 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or then never left.
8360 2018-03-06 07:01:03 Facts are amazing things. First, you run a deficit of only 18 billion with Canada , which is a mere 3% of total goods traded.  That difference is mostly due to oil which you import.  Second, that trade war, due to the fact you consume far more than you produce, will result in..

8368 2018-03-06 07:00:12 Stay short as long as you dare. I think you know as well as the rest of us that it's coming out of the ground one way or another. Bit like shorting the Standard Oil Co in 1870... might work for a little while but it's gonna burn you big time sooner than later. GL!

8390 2018-03-06 06:55:28 How can Saudi’s and other Middle East countries ship their oil to our Maritime provinces to get their oil refined if we don’t have enough refineries?
8391 2018-03-06 06:55:26 What kind of event would do that? Oil price spike?

8401 2018-03-06 06:53:04 Consequently I will take the common sense measure of nationalizing all Alberta oil companies and forcing them to not sell to anyone in B.C. Yes we will unblock a new pipeline by blocking the existing one.

8431 2018-03-06 06:48:47 not really but thats better actually since it's taking CO2 from the air and putting it into a physical form (plastic) for a long time, not taking oil and making plastic that will eventually decompose to CO2 in the air

8471 2018-03-06 06:40:18 No, but I sure as hell don't want my bleach, HCL, rubbing alcohol, motor oil, or transmission fluid, in containers that can degrade
8472 2018-03-06 06:40:13 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
8473 2018-03-06 06:40:05 Prepared for a road emergency? Stock your car's trunk with useful tools like a flashlight, rope, extra oil, water and a first-aid kit.
8474 2018-03-06 06:39:40 I've always figured that Tillerson wanted sanctions lifted to get at the oil.
8475 2018-03-06 06:39:38 Agreed, but imagine a world without polical interference by the US and UK, especially oil companies.
8476 2018-03-06 06:39:37 Seriously? Funding CBC in public's money is totally all risk no rewards. Fighting against CAD natural resource while taking oil industry money. Time to pull your head from your ass

8479 2018-03-06 06:39:18 Sir: With all due respect, the USA doesn't want a pipeline. We appreciate your country selling oil cheaply to the USA because you can't export it to someone else. Why would you want to generate wealth in Canada?

We normalize them using their own language of self-justification. A prime mover for cars is oil money, but this can be substituted with another type of money.

exxon does oil business with russia
trump owes russia money and a whole lot more
8504 2018-03-06 06:34:15 Maybe Alberta needs to think of a future beyond big oil. It won't last forever and by the time they suck the last gallon out of the oil sands there will be nothing left but toxic tailing ponds leaching into the ground water and derelict rigs littering the landscape.

8508 2018-03-06 06:33:05 It’s so good but it has to be legitimately truffle infused because a lot of ‘truffle oil’ is sold that isn’t made with truffles, like at Woolies
8509 2018-03-06 06:32:46 That's no good,  have you tried goanna oil?

8547 2018-03-06 06:27:45 According to IEA global #oil demand will increase 6.9 million barrels per day to reach 104.7 million barrels per day by 2023.

Corbyn supports hand-chopping, woman-stoning, gay-killing Iranians beacuse he likes them.
Both are obscene, but which is worse?

8749 2018-03-06 05:52:42 The oil like hardened in the engine because of a leak. I swear I’ve taken that car to the auto shop so many times I wish they could’ve spotted it sooner
8750 2018-03-06 05:52:15 So you are okay with oil when it suits your purpose. We will not get to a point of a pollution free world without the resources our country currently controls and one of those is oil.

8759 2018-03-06 05:50:25 The only oil that will stay in the USA is the oil that gets spilled and washes up on our shores. The oil they take will be shipped overseas and do NOTHING for US energy independence. There is no rule that the oil pumped here must be sold here. #oilcompanyshill

Remember. Plastic sinks back into the earth and goes back to the oil table but not without polluting the water table temporarily.

8781 2018-03-06 05:45:27 Holy Moly Tom!

8789 2018-03-06 05:43:55 We only wish. Unfortunately Kenny is blowing smoke. Cut the oil and you cut revenue to KM. KM is highly leveraged and the bond holders would squeeze Kenny like a train locomotive squeezes a penny on a RR track.

8822 2018-03-06 05:39:24 I just posted this morning about Young Living Tea Tree oil. I used it for one night and it cleared up almost every bit I had. Tonight is treatment number two. (Tea tree with coconut oil as the carrier.)
8823 2018-03-06 05:39:24 And now #TheOilyManiac is using parkour to flee from a pimp who is chasing him on a bicycle.

8852 2018-03-06 05:33:13 The borders are too porous to be manned unless we want to build walls around them. What we need is economic policies that would make smuggling unprofitable. E.g if we produce refined oil in abundance it would become a legit business selling them to neighboring countries.

8891 2018-03-06 05:27:39 Don’t fall prey to the “clean it with rocksalt” thing. We just use a non-soapy sponge and make sure to oil it again (not even heated, just a light wipe with a paper towel) before you put it away. That made things easier.
8892 2018-03-06 05:27:16 Wish we could stop the flow of Alberta's crusty, RACIST, ARROGANT, old, white, rich, oil executives who move here to retire.
8893 2018-03-06 05:26:50 @ my car, stop burning oil before long trips, asshole.
8894 2018-03-06 05:26:49 Yandy didn’t need to oil him up tho

8896 2018-03-06 05:26:21 Christopher Steele in his dossier says Russia influenced the rejection of Mitt Romney for Secretary Of State - but what is really chilling is the choice of Tillerson of Exxon afterwards who is liked by Russia (b/c Russian economy is oil heavy) and received an award from them...

8902 2018-03-06 05:25:22 jojoba oil and jamaican black castor oil are on my list of oils to try and im only tweeting this so i can remember it
8903 2018-03-06 05:25:16 A simple one I have quite often is rocket (I believe you guys call it arugula) sliced red onion, shaved parmesan, balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Simple, healthy, tasty.
8904 2018-03-06 05:25:16 I read your routine thread and I think we have similar tastes in products. I've been using the DHC deep cleansing oil from amazon and it's been working well as a first cleanser, followed by cosrx good morning. Only catch is that you need a lot of product and it's kind of pricey
8905 2018-03-06 05:25:15 Oga since you claim to be a economist and hypocrite wld prompt my reply, what of the price of oil. Do you forget Nigeria is a mono economy?

8911 2018-03-06 05:24:06 My skin has been so dry, so I’m gonna try an overnight oil treatment and see how this works out.
8912 2018-03-06 05:23:59 Try putting your shirt in the crate, also they have calming medication....he may need it. Dogs can use CBD oil too.
8913 2018-03-06 05:23:40 honestly i don’t know shit about skin care but rose absolute fortifying in jojoba oil is that bitch!!! evens my skin tone and is perfect for dry or sensitive skin and it smells bomb!!!

8915 2018-03-06 05:23:32 I love rosehip oil help acne scars; helps moisturize my dry ass cheeks, and it’s also good for anti-aging. Using this oil literally makes your skin GLOOOOW!!! This oil is literally my life lol
8916 2018-03-06 05:23:19 by what authority does BC, indigenous groups  and environmental extremists think they can landlock AB oil? Because n/w/s the carbon taxes "social license". Our Oil remains shut in.

8919 2018-03-06 05:23:09 Trump, Tillerson and all the other GOP/ Russian Patriots are forbidding  this to happen. Tillerson had a "warm, historic" relationship with Putin...STILL DOES! He's one of the BIGGEST TRAITORS of all! This retired billionaire came on board 2 protect his/Putin's oil rights...
8920 2018-03-06 05:23:02 Oil sales declined by three per cent to 16.53mn tonnes in July-February period of this fiscal year as against 16.96mn tonnes in the same period of 2016-17, primarily owing to drop in furnace oil (FO) sales to power sector

8926 2018-03-06 05:22:08 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
8927 2018-03-06 05:22:05 Rex Tillerson would have been a perfect selection from Putin himself! With Exxon having over 60 million acres of untapped oil reserves in Russia blocked by US/Russian sanctions. No wonder the election meddling isn't being fought against.... Total Russian controlled!

8933 2018-03-06 05:21:21 Same approach for elephant trophies. Probably the same for mineral/oil rights to what once were public lands. 
Show him the money. Overt, blatant corruption and Congress does nothing. Truly unbelievable.

8978 2018-03-06 05:12:53 or do you rather enjoy giving all the profits to the US-owned oil companies, or do you like getting less royalties than other countries, or do you like shipping a raw product to buy it back as refined? and when peak demand hits with electric cars... then we will ?

8994 2018-03-06 05:09:47 Oil sands, also known as "tar sands," are sediments or sedimentary rocks composed of sand, clay minerals, water, and bitumen. The oil is in the form of bitumen, a very heavy liquid or sticky black solid with a low melting temperature.
8995 2018-03-06 05:09:46 Jojoba oil is that girl. Mimics the properties if your skins natural oils and doesn’t clog pores. Also, rose hip oil is great if you have sensitive skin in need of lasting moisture and nourishment. Both help with texture and evening out complexion

9023 2018-03-06 05:04:17 Ok tell me why hes better for them. What specific policy has screwed us to prop them up? Raising tariffs on their products? Raising oil production to levels that have us energy independent? Maybe it's his America first policies?
9024 2018-03-06 05:04:12 Was he buying crude oil, fenced by Erdogan's sons, supplied and smuggled out by ISIS? Now THAT would be a story to read. Or just another jilted lover that wouldn't pay the perfumed Prince?

9028 2018-03-06 05:03:43 So the Chinese subsidize steel we use to produce weapons, construct buildings, build cars, & manufacture appliances that as a result cost Americans less. Imagine the horror if Venezuelans, Mexicans, & Canadiens subsidized oil companies & dumped it in American markets!
9029 2018-03-06 05:03:42 No oil for two weeks. Refineries down. Buy gasoline from the USA. No heating oil. No bunker oil for the ports. Gasoline at $3/liter. Yup, Alberta would prove they mean business. Go @jkenney go!!!

9033 2018-03-06 05:02:42 I'm female. not that it matters. But, to reply, US helped create this mess, only right she comes in and fixes it. It's not the oil, I know where it's all going. Rebuild, de-mine, EOD anti-ordinance work. All being used in country. I'm mechE doing 'other work' I appreciate opinion
9034 2018-03-06 05:02:38 So much more oil. It's a good thing.
9035 2018-03-06 05:02:20 Oh phew! Thanks for getting back to me.  Can I just say that beauty drops is the best face oil I have ever used hence feeling quite lost without it... & yes I have been added to the wish list - will drop a line to the email you have mentioned. Thanks again! X

9045 2018-03-06 05:00:20 China has 38 times the population Canada does but only around 17 times the emissions... India is doing well per capita... Iran has just over double our population... Saudi Arabia a little less but they do produce a hell of a lot of oil...
Why are you so worried about "Canada"?

9047 2018-03-06 04:59:58 I would seen someone might’ve cooked a little too long in the oil
9048 2018-03-06 04:59:56 This is 80% higher than the 5 MMbpd of 2008 and closing in on the all-time high 10 MMbpd of 1970...  See the graph of rising oil production at article.

Has over 60 MILLION acres of untapped oil reserves that exploration blocked by US/RUSSIAN sanctions. Putin directly benefits if oil is tapped!  Wants sanctions dropped

9052 2018-03-06 04:58:33 U.S. oil production has undergone a significant transformation in the last 10 years...The U.S. has now established itself as the world' s 3rd largest producer trailing Saudi Arabia and Russia, with 9.09 million barrels/day (MMbpd) reached in early March 2017.

9107 2018-03-06 04:49:04 Is 4.5% inflation cause for alarm? 

Check inflation rates for the past two decades. 

Check inflation rates for the past decade. 

Check global oil prices from 2012 to 2014.

You can answer that question on your own after doing all those.
9108 2018-03-06 04:49:02 When the time will arrive, Saudi Arabia will be the world’s Whore House.

Of course people had the good sense to always add “seed” in the middle. “Rape oil” was not something ppl wanted to say.

9128 2018-03-06 04:46:08 I have always contended that the key to Putin/Tillerson is control of Arctic oil soon to be easily accessible w/ climate change. Putin’s dark money is intertwined w/ Rosneft and related oligarchs...the oil fields are income for the rest of the century...warming be damned.

9146 2018-03-06 04:43:35 For example:
A reusable bottle vs. a bottle you throw after using it. Both are made with oil, but the reusable bottle with its shelf life should strongly compensate for the energy it took to do it.

9150 2018-03-06 04:43:07 But for now oil is still a major pollutant, especially when it is used as fuel.

When it comes to getting rid of everything that is done with oil it is a bit difficult because it can serve to do things lasting.
9151 2018-03-06 04:42:53 Sprinkled lavender oil on my pillow last night and I had the most restful sleep. I’m at work, it’s 2pm and I still feel fine. I’m usually so exhausted.
9152 2018-03-06 04:42:42 I never said that I was entirely against oil, I suggest more investing in research that aims to reduce pollution, who knows maybe one of his research is going to fire that oil could become 0% pollutant.
9153 2018-03-06 04:42:41 I'm looking for any references looking at the impact of oil and gas development on pollinators. searched online but finding nothing. ????
9154 2018-03-06 04:42:21 Big 3 point game for oil and yotes.
9155 2018-03-06 04:42:18 Do you know why it failed? Curious if it’s over stuff like gas prices increasing and other cost of living stuff. If so, you could address with a carbon dividend. If it’s oil & gas opposition that’s another matter.
9156 2018-03-06 04:42:13 Of course not. I'm in Washington. Blue west and Red east, but blue generally runs the show.
I grew up in Alaska where the regressive oil patch carpetbaggers turned it into a GOP kleptocracy. They destroyed Alaska's cultures and norms.

9176 2018-03-06 04:38:47 Milk gave me cystic acne where as genetics gave me oily skin, reminiscent of an oil spill.
9177 2018-03-06 04:38:43 Essential oils, I swear by anything lavender. Don’t know what SD’s laws are on CBD, but CBD oil helps me a ton as well.
9178 2018-03-06 04:38:31 It makes perfect sense. Plenty of prosperity going on. And record levels of oil production going on.

So if 'you're' not prospering who's fault is that?

9181 2018-03-06 04:37:45 My current routine is Cetaphil daily cleanser, jojoba oil, and Cetaphil ultra hydrating moisturizer and vitamin C serum 2-3 times a week instead of jojoba
9182 2018-03-06 04:37:45 Try Alpha Keri skin & bath oil. It's my stand-by. Light, non-greasy, feels really good after a shower.  And it works!
9183 2018-03-06 04:37:43 I want Corey to comfort me about this crazy ass guy in oil springs but we are arguing about where the roads are 
9184 2018-03-06 04:37:32 I’ve heard life is a balance of performance and longevity. Do you risk your joints for yet another marathon? Do you burn the midnight oil to get the competitive edge? It’s all a trade off somewhere #performance #longevity

TAX THE OIL & GAS COMPANIES THE SAME RATE YOU TAX EVERYONE ELSE! 

at that it’s still lower than any other oil state! elected officials need to get their hands out of the oil cookie jar and do the right thing!
9191 2018-03-06 04:36:21 Typical Calgary flame. Can’t wait to bug my co worker tomorrow. I hope the oil win in ot.

9206 2018-03-06 04:33:46 In 60,000 km on a vehicle 2 oil changes were at 9,000 instead of 8,000 so warranty denied by @nissancanada and no assistance from @WestEndNissan . Absolute worst customer service from both. Extended warranty from @Nissan is a joke, watch yourself when purchasing.

9210 2018-03-06 04:32:56 Re pre-recession peak 2013-2014 - when oil ranged $90-100+,  was largely considered a booming period e.g. overheating, inflated prices, labour cost high,  significant oil sands expansion etc  Payroll lags oil.. is there comparable/normalized baseline for recovery expectations?
9211 2018-03-06 04:32:48 "If you told me I would be standing here about to solve the world's energy problems I wouldn't believe it. Now help me push this ball of oil out of this window."
9212 2018-03-06 04:32:42 I’ve been putting coconut oil on my eye lashes every night, and idk if it’s just me or what but I swear they’ve grown.
9213 2018-03-06 04:32:42 @realDonaldTrump Treasonous.  Not a cent of the $120 million allocated to Sec. of State to fight Russians has been used. REALLY? Tillerson brokered largest oil deal w/Russians. Now won’t fight their attacks on our elections. U IDIOT. Americans should storm the WH & throw U OUT.
9214 2018-03-06 04:32:36 Season it, drizzle some olive oil on it, and Pop it in the oven 
9215 2018-03-06 04:32:31 I put that as the second comment to this tweet. I'm aware oil doesn't work for everyone's skin.
9216 2018-03-06 04:32:28 don't get lost in a pancake panic- put a good layer of oil in the pan, medium heat, and less batter. wait till you see little bubbles and then flip. these look like protein pancakes which are less fluffy, so flip it quickly
9217 2018-03-06 04:32:08 My eyelash tech recommended HIGHLY diluted tea tree oil before I go in to get my lashes done. Guess who played fast and loose with the tea tree oil and has a right eye that is still stinging 
9218 2018-03-06 04:32:06 Nunberg was shit talking today and I think a bit of a distraction. The big news today was Steele and how Russia totally owns this administration. It's not that Mittens would be tough on Russia but that Putin told trump he wanted Tillerson. Tillerson=oil.

9237 2018-03-06 04:29:30 Also I know I joke about it a lot but replacing fatty butter and vegetable oil with coconut oil is a top tier life saver when it comes to dieting. It makes your system work harder to burn fat and revs up your metabolism
9238 2018-03-06 04:29:28 Sorry but that is not the stage this group is at. That mentality is what got them into their current predicament. Oilers have plenty of youth, they need players who can contribute...age is irrelevant.
9239 2018-03-06 04:29:27 Trump is the showmaster. He was interviewing many people f ok r Secretary of state including AL Gore! It was preordained most likely to be Rex as he was decorated by Putin and would not implement the sanctions. Hypothesized e had a number of oil deals with Putin as well!
9240 2018-03-06 04:28:59 Amy, there is a special polish you can get. Taste is foul but looks great. And it can help. Get the nail oil as well. It helps. But warn Chris in case he likes to kiss your hands. And be careful if the babies have your fingers in their mouths. I suspect they are teething soon.

9242 2018-03-06 04:28:52 There is no cleaning product to whiten Boost again. You’d have to paint it with the oil based markers aka Sharpies. For the cages, assuming they’re solid cages, not two tone cages, clean them with cotton rounds dabbed in acetone. That’s what’s worked for me and my heel cups too.

9250 2018-03-06 04:28:08 Agreed, awful. But his character masks his deficiencies and you know how the oil love character over actual on ice ability.
9251 2018-03-06 04:28:05 The US will be the worlds largest oil producer by 2023, for those of us that are old enough to remember the oil embargo of the 70s, at that time our government led us to believe we didn’t have enough oil left here in America- Dependent on the middle east, We were scammed again
9252 2018-03-06 04:27:11 Hey folks! @alexstamos needs help deciding what kind of oil to use for the popcorn. 

Thoughts?
9253 2018-03-06 04:26:54 Johnson’s baby products are a must for me. I use everything from the soap to the lotion. Baby powder to the oil. I LOVE IT.
9254 2018-03-06 04:26:38 I must say I already knew why Rex Tillerson was picked for Secretary of State (oil deal) but I did not know Trump originally did want @MittRomney I thought it was just a dog and pony show. Buckle up people after Nunberg’s meltdown today it is only going to get worse. 
9255 2018-03-06 04:26:38 @MSNBC doesn’t anyone realize Tillerson is a Russian mole!  I stated in a tweet when he was first picked for State that Puttin urged Trump to not pick Romney to pick Tillerson so Exxon and Russia can finish their oil deal!  Tillerson has and continues to commit treason!!
9256 2018-03-06 04:26:36 Not too bad. You’re not going to get perfect in politics. I’m in NL and their family support is massive. I’m not in the oil industry or I would be conservative. Trust me the struggle is real these days but it just cannot get worse than what the US have
9257 2018-03-06 04:26:18 What's the take from the oil and gas industries about this 'plan' by @jkenney? What would be the real dollar cost in terms of interrupted supply to customers, lost sales and transportation revenue, etc.? What would be the long term effects of his grand idea? #ableg #abpoli
9258 2018-03-06 04:26:07 Or, someone is getting a cut from the oil deal in Russia.
9259 2018-03-06 04:26:07 this is so common people bonwa castor oil thinking it's nothing major.
9260 2018-03-06 04:25:51 If you choose to use essential oils, stay far far away from peppermint oil. It can cause contractions in pregnant women. Hope you feel better 
9261 2018-03-06 04:25:38 If you care about state power, forbid oil drilling on the west coast as no one here wants it.
9262 2018-03-06 04:25:29 Hope you mean time spent toward blocking oil and gas companies in the catskills and/or banning plastic bags

9267 2018-03-06 04:24:35 Fantastic! That would compound with whatever the courts decide from the illegal wine actions they took. Then there would be the liabilities from their actual oil customers who would sue Alberta for such nonsense.

9284 2018-03-06 04:20:07 @NancyCNBC Goodmorning it is interesting to me all of sudden the focus of market shifted from stocks earning to commodities , steel , aluminium, oil etc! it shows how news dynamic is and so volatility!

9286 2018-03-06 04:19:56 It's been obvious from the beginning, he was Putin's choice. It was also where GOP revealed themselves as Putin's puppets, or he never would have been confirmed, w/his Ruskie & oil ties. Tillerson confirmed it was "all about the oil."
9287 2018-03-06 04:19:46 Of course my dumb head was driving with a flat tire and didn't notice & thought that the sign that popped up my on dashboard meant that I needed to get an oil change.. when the whole time it was telling me my tire pressure was low..

9309 2018-03-06 04:15:53 My car needs an oil change
9310 2018-03-06 04:15:43 Yeah...not sure if they know what the word “bind” means in this context...
9311 2018-03-06 04:15:39 말만들어도 지친다.... 난 예전에 피티할때 버핏 그거 젤로 시러해써여... 넘 힘드러 그거 근데 그거하고 플랭크라니 지옥을 보야주네
9312 2018-03-06 04:15:24 She needed her oil checked. How else you gonna check it without sticking your dipstick in first?
9313 2018-03-06 04:15:23 Vaporub Is Snake Oil But I Love Her Anyway
9314 2018-03-06 04:15:18 Well I definitely don’t wanna lose my brows forever  I might try castor oil again. I did it once and it worked, but it worked too well and they grew out of control, my brows just love being difficult 
9315 2018-03-06 04:15:15 Don't ask why but if you vape and are given the opportunity to vape an oil called "Green Mist", I highly suggest not doing that
9316 2018-03-06 04:15:11 *going through photos for our wedding slide show"

"Why are you holding a drink or have very clearly had several drinks in ALL these photos?"

Well, I'm not about to take photos of myself buying a loaf of bread, or getting an oil change now, am I?
9317 2018-03-06 04:15:05 Yea ,because more countries are going away from using oil products . oh ,don’t forget the coal industry your  trying to bring back ,over clean gas ..
9318 2018-03-06 04:15:04 Oil companies should pay more royalties like in other countries, some of that should go to retraining as the world moves from fossil fuels
9319 2018-03-06 04:15:04 The oil produced in my face is enough to supply the whole world
9320 2018-03-06 04:15:01 @billtu hi bill - wishing u better - try cbd oil .......
9321 2018-03-06 04:15:01 Ha!  I'm something of a leather conditioner snob, I guess!  I like products with beeswax in them as well as good fine oil - there are several brands that have the ingredients I like, but there's a big quality range among them. (And I don't like the sticky feel of Lexol.)

9323 2018-03-06 04:14:55 i have a great supplier for petro fuel and used cooking oil.  If you need fuel please contact me.  dean9807@gmail.com
9324 2018-03-06 04:14:45 yesterday Kat left for five minutes and I started a grease fire, panicked, burnt the linoleum in my bathroom, poured the grease into the toilet, had the toilet SPEW FLAMES, jumped back, spilled flaming oil in the hallway, and singed my hair
9325 2018-03-06 04:14:38 Positive reforms like rafale scam or nirav modi or vyapam scam ? Or not even touching a hair of the bjp leader who mowed down 33 children killing 9 of them. Or the highest pricing if petrol with lowest pricing of crude oil. Which one of these are you referring to.
9326 2018-03-06 04:14:35 There are no tarrifs on oil and gas.
9327 2018-03-06 04:14:29 If the power goes off you invite all the homies over put some foil on the grill and make steakums sandwiches off the grill,  mushrooms and onions olive oil garlic in a coffee can, filter out the oil, over french cruchy garlic bread with grill lines.
9328 2018-03-06 04:14:29 Hypocrisy. The spin is cheap; the action costs money. @IrfanSabirMLA @RachelNotley @shoffmanAB @LoriSigurdson @DoctorCanBob Folks on AISH are stuck with no sort of subsidy of the sort that the oil industry gets just cuz the oil industry is our government. @jkenney #Ableg #Abpoli
9329 2018-03-06 04:14:25 There is a lot of oil waiting to be pumped.
9330 2018-03-06 04:14:09 I’m doing tea tree oil now! Thank you!
9331 2018-03-06 04:14:09 Rip someone spilled a little essential oil on my lamp and didn’t clean it up
9332 2018-03-06 04:14:02 Fire Sprite Tormentil: Flowers are enormous, fuzzy, and tube-shaped. Deadly poisonous. Fruit a chin-up. Tastes of chili oil.
9333 2018-03-06 04:13:40 No but I’m considering it. I’ve been vaping thc oil a lot lately.
9334 2018-03-06 04:13:31 So does this mean yet another trip? Maybe make it a cruise this time on TAX payers dime. Go when all those oil tankers are out bringing the oil to Canada.Then you can explain why we are not providing our own oil. Tell us why your government LIED about starting pipelines.
9335 2018-03-06 04:13:29 This is really good news! If there's only penguins on Danger Island we should look for oil, or a possible nuclear waste dump site.
9336 2018-03-06 04:13:27 I call his bluff - might be interesting here on the coast to see how we would survive without Alberta oil.
9337 2018-03-06 04:13:16 They need a coach that is committed to the development of the young players.  Playing them a lot and in key situations
9338 2018-03-06 04:13:13 Forgive me if I cynically watch for indications our "support " includes oil or mineral sales. 
Anything this admin. does is in its own interest, as we all know.

(Like our 4 dead troops being in Niger - coincidentally 1 of top 3 Uranium producing countries in world.)
9339 2018-03-06 04:13:02 Buffalo or roasted cauliflower, some sort of warm bread that’s on the program when you want meat, @nativefoodscafe, coconut oil in your coffee,
9340 2018-03-06 04:12:53 Rex Tillerson received a gold medal from Putin declaring Rex "A Friend of Russia";if you look closely you'll see the fine print that says "thanks for the global oil deals that you and I and trump share".
9341 2018-03-06 04:12:51 Oh how clever. Duped by an Eastern snake oil salesman and you give me playground banter. Typical bot behavior.
9342 2018-03-06 04:12:36 I have managed to loose a whole jar of coconut oil. Happy Monday
9343 2018-03-06 04:12:33 @realDonaldTrump we need to let go of the old, and in with the new. Seriously.  No coal, no oil  we need to harness wind and solar /2
9344 2018-03-06 04:12:19 Look up organic Olivia on YouTube! She has a video all about oil based face routines, it’s helped me a lot!
9345 2018-03-06 04:12:14 This is so very true.
Always remember that what the experts say doesn't change reality.
There is a literal ocean of oil in the Permian Basin and it was there while the experts were saying we were almost out of oil.
9346 2018-03-06 04:11:55 @maddow @MaddowBlog The Russian relationship with Trump & Tillerson all boils down to the billions of oil that Russia wants to drill with Exxon.  Trump & Tillerson & others expect to lift sanctions preventing the drilling& get very rich once the drilling begins. This explains all

9352 2018-03-06 04:10:59 Probably the Russian fertilizer king will grind our ancestor’s bones for profit, drill oil in Arlington and frack gas at Mt Rushmore.  Lordy, let’s lose these grifters.

9356 2018-03-06 04:10:06 I should think so after the greek gods over turned the titans and the 7 wars syria had because of their gold then, the oil fat heads will have to divert their strategy as we need to protect gold on that piece of WW2 paper of world order peace that SHOULD BE ARCHIVED ? by law
9357 2018-03-06 04:09:53 @steveallenshow best way to treat a cough is steam yourself using eucalyptus oil 2 to 3 times a day @LBC
9358 2018-03-06 04:09:44 Why your nails dirty? You been changing oil? 
9359 2018-03-06 04:09:38 Funny u sit there & love off ur glazers who r business men yet strike us 4 another business men who invested in us. U guys have thrown shade 4 yrs & can’t take it these days. U rags need a history lesson. We loaned u players, a field with lights etc yet oil money is ur trump card
9360 2018-03-06 04:09:29 huge mistake ... in the ground it is America's reserve for 100 years from now ... US needs to go clean, green, renewable for energy and find other ways to produce oil products
9361 2018-03-06 04:09:24 I’m currently uploading a hair oil recipe  it works so good! My hair has grown a lot, and I encourage you all to try it

9374 2018-03-06 04:06:49 I once heard Anastasia say that some brow hairs never grow back. I'd suggest you use castor oil every night, be very consistent, and your brows will be fab in like 2 months.

9376 2018-03-06 04:05:47 Just look at Venezuela the country with the largest oil reserves, and many people are literally eating garbage to survive.
9377 2018-03-06 04:05:40 4 killed and wounded and 30 shops were burned when an oil tanker got fire in Nangarhar province.@pajhwok
9378 2018-03-06 04:05:36 I believe Israel will b the biggest producer of oil shortly. They hit oil an now waiting for testing. We should know in April.
9379 2018-03-06 04:05:15 The $275 vertical tank model. Nearly maintenance free and reliable as a shovel. The pricier one is for 220v and has oil lubed compressor - more for the roofers and framing carpenters
9380 2018-03-06 04:04:50 I would think it would be a lot more impressive if we led the world in Renewables! Oil is dirty and finite!
9381 2018-03-06 04:04:50 She need some OIL SHEEN
9382 2018-03-06 04:04:47 She's built her brand being trustworthy and she wouldn't sell snake oil. That she truly believes in this product. Her team are medical professionals etc etc. She's addressing all the major concerns. Also talking about how people have been harassing her and her family.

9386 2018-03-06 04:04:03 70 years of peace? What a load of BS! USA cause of most wars since WWll! #OIL
9387 2018-03-06 04:03:58 Do not drill/develop the oil/gas now.  Until all other sources are depleted, then negotiate for drilling. Do not be fooled, save your resources. Keep your land.  Fracking also requires at least 1 Million gallons of fresh potable water

9400 2018-03-06 04:01:56 Go ahead - We have enough Natural Gas in BC for our needs & shut the oil off to BC - Will help us move off fossil fuels faster & on to sustainable Solar Wind Tidal & Geothermal - Alberta can keep their dirty Tar Sands Oil & Keep BC Beautiful forever

9407 2018-03-06 04:01:22 I’ve often made the same mistake! Warby Parker mixed up my glasses. Saw an oil derrick wearing a beret. I mistakenly awarded it an NEA grant.
9408 2018-03-06 04:01:15 Wait.. BC wants less oil going thru them, and Kent wants to punish them by not doing oil thru BC? Okay...
9409 2018-03-06 04:01:08 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. & the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up... James 5:14-15
9410 2018-03-06 04:01:04 Yes let’s name a National Parks Highway after a man who wants to sell off our National Parks and Monuments for drilling! Any Utah lawmakers that are oil or gas men?

9413 2018-03-06 04:00:49 Leftist heads of state, political leaders UN government bureaucrats don't gather to address climate change– rather, their task is to demonize capitalism, American prosperity, modernism, evil oil companies, to save Eurocommunism from scrutiny and eat champagne, baguettes and brie.
9414 2018-03-06 04:00:48 There is no flow of jet fuel - just crude oil. It’s all refined locally.  Hence the ‘build an refinery and sell jet fuel’ argument always fails.
9415 2018-03-06 04:00:46 Work has been pretty terrible lately, but my consolation for today is that the ulam is pork steak.

9416 2018-03-06 04:00:43 Hear castor oil help or coconut too! U can tryyy.. but i knew outside there r many lash growing serum but not too sure bout themm
9417 2018-03-06 04:00:36 Yep....actual substance costs more than snake oil
9418 2018-03-06 04:00:28 It's been since 1971 that the US has not been collecting gold like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The Petrodollar was in fact a genus deal, though real only as far as it went. Death throes of 100 yrs. Oil War. Modern money means spend it wisely.
9419 2018-03-06 04:00:28 If screaming #Fox banchees, @JudgeJeanine & #Hannity were to desert @realDonaldTrump now ...OMG: he'd turn into a KFC oil stain. Sad.

9421 2018-03-06 04:00:22 Tariff bingo seems like a difficult thing to control. For every industry/job that may benefit from a tariff, many more may be adversely impacted, but maybe the Stable Genius has it figured out - like taxing coastal states or drilling for oil?  Nah, he’s just live tweeting FOX.
9422 2018-03-06 04:00:14 This is what I've been thinking for a while now. The Russians are paying all of them and Tilt-erson is making a huge oil deal with Russia that all the @gop are in on and will profit from in big ways. That's why trump refuses to engage sanctions and @gop won't do it.

9452 2018-03-06 03:55:33 Oil on canvas .
9453 2018-03-06 03:55:24 Okay, Inspector Gadget. Your a fool. Stop embarrassing yourself. You should probably read up on prison survival skills and stop trying to distract attack past politicians. Nobody is buying your snake oil. Move along.
9454 2018-03-06 03:55:23 It’s just half pure aloe Vera gel, half jojoba oil and a splash of tea tree oil! Yeah tru that’s why I’m like whaaaa
9455 2018-03-06 03:55:22 Lol let them have it
9456 2018-03-06 03:55:17 万年調子のってるマンだから問題ないよ！調子のって外交全部やってくれるなら私はそれでいいしなー。まあ、私と夫比べたら、営業やってて外面いい夫に話しかけやすいのは理解できるんだなぁ。

9458 2018-03-06 03:55:04 I read a very in-depth article on this subject, (Ukraine and Russian oil pipeline) around the time the Dossier was first acknowledged and wish I could find it now! I wish I had documented a timeline in Excel of who knew what and when as I read it too!
9459 2018-03-06 03:55:03 @MBuhari Oil Companies in Nigeria are loosing Money. Nigeria is not safe. Oil companies need Financial Security.
9460 2018-03-06 03:54:59 I done washed my hair, deep conditioned and did a hot oil treatment. I feel accomplished
9461 2018-03-06 03:54:51 Tillerson’s company Exxon Mobile has a multi billion dollar oil deal with Russia that is on hold because of sanctions. Talk about conflict of interest.
9462 2018-03-06 03:54:50 Lmao can't stop
9463 2018-03-06 03:54:48 紹介できますが……色々な理由から見るに徹した方が楽しめると思います(;´-｀)
9464 2018-03-06 03:54:27 I inhale tea tree oil like it’s my job.
9465 2018-03-06 03:54:22 Also hasn’t the US been closing the gap in regards to oil production for some time now?
9466 2018-03-06 03:54:20 Nonsense. They LIED us into a war. They were as corrupt over ME oil and Saudi Arabia as Trump is with Russia. They fueled dissent at every turn, including things like letting the assault ban expire. They're complicit in this mess.
9467 2018-03-06 03:54:09 I was upset over this exam and my mom gon say... “don’t cry over spilled oil” ....Africans man I’m not even upset anymore 
9468 2018-03-06 03:54:09 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9469 2018-03-06 03:54:02 I cooked 2 seasoned chicken breasts, sprayed both sides lightly with oil, cooked to dankness in like 15 minutes and I didnt have to do shit
9470 2018-03-06 03:53:58 So the Plan is to nationalize the Oil industry?  Other than that not sure how he is going to dictate what a private company does.
9471 2018-03-06 03:53:54 Something involving coconut oil, Usopp, or Shadow probably. Or all three
9472 2018-03-06 03:53:45 Canada is in a freefall of wanton taxation and political correctness absurdity.

Clean the water, clean the air, protect our greenlands and kick start our economy... Start with our oil industry. It makes shit happen in Canada.
9473 2018-03-06 03:53:45 Who disrespected a veteran? I just cleared up your definition of what was a veteran. But, don’t demand respect. I’m glad you served, but that’s your choice. Our military doesn’t protect the US anymore. No one is going to war. Military post 1980 is about American interests...oil.
9474 2018-03-06 03:53:44 Yes! I have been alarmed since he was appointed, he works for big oil and has no plans to protect the environment
9475 2018-03-06 03:53:40 Random: I just bought a new thing - an air fryer. 

Me: ....

Random: So it fries food without using oil

Me: so you bought an oven?
9476 2018-03-06 03:53:26 I always thought Tillerson was way too cozy with Vlad. Waaaay too many worldwide big oil and gas business interests to keep him clean as SOS. Just more layers of corruption. Seems like a bottomless pit of grifting.
9477 2018-03-06 03:53:18 But I still think there's a big difference between wine and oil......although I supose if you used a good amount of either one, you'll stay warm til,you froze to death
9478 2018-03-06 03:53:13 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
9479 2018-03-06 03:52:55 Coconut oil and smashed avacados mixed then worked into your scalp. Softens your hair and naturally increases growth!
9480 2018-03-06 03:52:54 So glad you 're talking National Security re: Trade - steel, aluminum. This is about greater issue than $$. How much is our security worth? I think Americans ready to pay more 4 security. ME mess we got embroiled in? Our dependence on foreign oil.
9481 2018-03-06 03:52:53 Man City proves to the world that in ANY sports or business, MONEY ensures you win. Its not your skills, talent or your business acumen. Its all about the MONEY! its sad that success is bought and not earn. The glory will be short lived no doubt once the oil and $$ runs out.
9482 2018-03-06 03:52:35 I don’t get why @GOP wants us to keep oil, pipe.ine, and fracking for American jobs, but doesn’t want steel to be made here instead of China  #IngrahamAngle
9483 2018-03-06 03:52:15 @jkenney @RachelNotley One thing for sure - you are effective mouthpieces for the oil industry.  Amazing that politicians are so easily bought.  I keep wondering what my grandchildren will think when they look back at early 21st century politicians so corrupted by shot term gain
9484 2018-03-06 03:52:10 That’s another zips of oil gone. Lol big clout
9485 2018-03-06 03:52:01 Take some fish oil and ice it
9486 2018-03-06 03:51:58 Are you prepared to live without oil?
9487 2018-03-06 03:51:54 (bring an extra oil can for me, will yah? gert's feelin rusty...)
9488 2018-03-06 03:51:49 I genuinely thought you were going to say, "Whale oil beef hooked."
9489 2018-03-06 03:51:07 I can still shoot straight and you better thank me, really.. I allow my husband to protect you daily.. I would choose.. He doesn’t choose..
9490 2018-03-06 03:50:53 My immediate thought is the canola oil and lack of milkfats. Not quite a hypothesis, but
9491 2018-03-06 03:50:50 me: "i forgot how juicy a clear gloss can make your lips look "
khai: "doesn't it just look like you have oil on ?"

9492 2018-03-06 03:50:38 Baby oil gel is the best thing ever created
9493 2018-03-06 03:50:37 Yes, but Russia has lots and lots of untapped oil.
Sustainable isn't in Russia's best interests.
9494 2018-03-06 03:50:36 taking supplements for hair growth & putting castor oil on my eyelashes every night. soon, it will be over for u bitches. except hair supplements make me break out so nvm
9495 2018-03-06 03:50:35 Every man needs a good kin routine and grooming routine. And im not just talking about coconut oil and shea butter
9496 2018-03-06 03:50:29 I only swear by two things and those are the Bible and coconut oil
9497 2018-03-06 03:49:55 Why does spray on slide oil exist? WHY?! My trombone is BATHED in oil rn. Wtf.
9498 2018-03-06 03:49:35 @subaru_usa Thought about getting a new Forester since my 2014 Forester may soon start having oil consumption issues, something you still don't admit. Turns out your 2017 Forester still seems to have the issue. Back to my first love, @Honda , I go!
9499 2018-03-06 03:49:34 My sweet catholic grandma was bragging to me about how she snuck her cannabis oil on her flight here  #timeshavechanged
9500 2018-03-06 03:49:21 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
9501 2018-03-06 03:49:20 I want to know when the refinery moratorium is going to be lifted.

9503 2018-03-06 03:49:07 Chinook Dicaprio.  Same winds my great grandfather felt before any oil known in Alberta #hypocrite #privateheli #unfairtaxchanges
9504 2018-03-06 03:49:00 So why do we need offshore drilling? We are already a net oil exporter.
9505 2018-03-06 03:48:53 Especially when prior to the election, Putin awarded him with the country's highest medal, for his work with their oil industry. Now you understand that Tillerson has been compromised more, as we investigate Russia, which explains the dismantling of our diplomatic core as SOS
9506 2018-03-06 03:48:43 Damn Tubby! That was a snake oil, sales pitch. Every player should walk out of Memphis tonight.
9507 2018-03-06 03:48:42 The refineries in Washington state refine oil from Alberta and Alaska. BC gets most of their refined products from Washington. Alberta would be shooting itself in the foot with no effect on BC.
9508 2018-03-06 03:48:41 only if we can call it the Crap Oil Pub
9509 2018-03-06 03:48:30 25% raise in tax wont hurt china steel they are already losing money on it. its there plan to bite the bullet on it to strangle all the main producers like opec does with oil. will all of u against the tarriff do some research before u talk. cause your idiot comments are #stupid
9510 2018-03-06 03:48:28 There were some MPs who argued for that during the parliamentary debate - changing the 1,182 ratio to something weaker to give Iraq more dinars for their oil dollars. But not accepted.
9511 2018-03-06 03:48:17 *you're
9512 2018-03-06 03:48:17 Oh wow. This is amazing. You’re so good at oil painting. ^^

9514 2018-03-06 03:47:54 @totalkenya did an oil change at Madaraka, never paid so much for oil like I did yesterday evening. My car got overfilled by almost 3 litres and carried home in excess of another litre. I have to go drain oil. Was charged Ksh 770/ltr for 11ltrs
9515 2018-03-06 03:47:36 What is a good tanning lotion/oil to use on a pasty white girl? Also is there a tinting lotion that I can use to not be blinding?
9516 2018-03-06 03:47:33 Thats not necessary. We shudnt be selling our oil...m

9521 2018-03-06 03:47:10 Things I hate: when Alex is sleeping and blows his stinky sleep breath at me. 

This is why I have an oil diffuser at the bedside.
9522 2018-03-06 03:47:06 Tillerson had been in putins pocket since he received the Russian friendship medal for the oil deals he was in charge of for ExxonMobil

9526 2018-03-06 03:46:28 Chef Louis cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with cheese.

9528 2018-03-06 03:46:08 You have to take care of your relationship just like your car. Oil changes, tune ups, alignment etc. to much wear and tear could cause your relationship to break down

9530 2018-03-06 03:45:39 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

9537 2018-03-06 03:44:39 Alberta ships heavy oil to BC where it is loaded on tankers for overseas or sent down to the US. Why would Alberta want to stop shipping to its foreign customers?
9538 2018-03-06 03:44:28 #metoo  Husband too.  The fool
9539 2018-03-06 03:44:14 i went from barely moisturizing or putting anything on my skin to putting on moisturizer, hand cream, arm cream, lip balm, spot treatment, castor oil (brows & lashes) & peppermint oil (temples) every night
9540 2018-03-06 03:44:12 No deficit with Canada, it’s a surplus. They buy many American products (cars, computers, iPhones, wine, oranges, tourism, etc., etc.). We buy raw resources (oil, lumber, uranium) and then add value. The US sells way more into Canada than it takes out. You know that, or should.
9541 2018-03-06 03:43:57 I just have one whole lemon, 1/4 cup olive oil, cup of filtered water and 1/2 tsp sea salt everyday! 
Detoxing, wonderful !
9542 2018-03-06 03:43:57 CPC strike or delay in oil shipment ;)
9543 2018-03-06 03:43:36 "Some people are good in one thing and bad at another". That statement is so deep that I consider extracting oil out of it. #CineMon

All these hatred due 2 inferiority complex of rss towards Left.intellectual poverty in sangh parivar
9546 2018-03-06 03:42:53 @jkenney Does that include oil shipped through Trans Mountain intended for US and international customers, or only the oil intended for BC? How does one differentiate with a fungible product? And is it just dilbit or does it include upgraded product?
9547 2018-03-06 03:42:44 Gas!!!!!!!!!!  Not oil.  Geeze.  Google is not your friend.  And gas prices are down.  Btw.  Do more research.  I know you don’t live here.
9548 2018-03-06 03:42:38 That sounds pretty incredible! I usually just roast them with a little olive oil and garlic

9591 2018-03-06 03:38:39 Typical "Conservative," he's against government telling business what to do right up until he's not. I'm sure the oil companies would LOVE the idea of not shipping as much. NOT.

Perhaps it's time for Alberta to realise that the grownups are actually in charge this time?
9592 2018-03-06 03:38:38 We are not rich. More than 93% of the U.S. fossil-fuel supply is in the form of non-economically sound coal. 21.3B bbls of proved oil reserves worth ~8yrs of consumption.

just like they did in Libya. 
The Saudis want a gas pipeline & Israel wants to
Keep the Golan heights, because it has oil.
Hillary & Obama made millions with the weapons sales.

9597 2018-03-06 03:38:17 They have officially stolen our Poodle Jesus from us. They've started putting some kind of oil in his hair so he doesn't dry out and poof up 
9598 2018-03-06 03:37:54 You nailed it. Shock to the folks listening to this BS while oil trends up approaching $100 in the next few years.

9600 2018-03-06 03:37:17 And yet neither you nor Ryan can provide ONE medical study proving the treatment protocol you advocate is consistently effective at relieving Gender Dysphoria. You're selling snake oil and you know it. This is about what's most convenient for you, not what's best for Trans ppl.

9608 2018-03-06 03:36:00 Awesome stat! Now, who received transfer payments and are they supporting the oil industry?

9611 2018-03-06 03:35:32 Seemed odd from the beginning #Trump would string #Romney along then overnight announce oil exec #RexTillerson as Secretary of State, perhaps one of the most sensitive jobs in any administration. Now we learn Rex does Russia's bidding. Exactly how many traitors that make to date?

9614 2018-03-06 03:35:10 Guys, what’s a good pen to buy for oil? I don’t wanna buy a shitty one.
9615 2018-03-06 03:35:09 @RexxTillerson was not appointed to be the "Secretary of State" as we know it, he was appointed to revive the $1/2T of the Russian oil deal w/ExxonMobil which was frozen after Obama's sanctions on Russia on the assumption Trump to lift them once he becomes POTUS!Period!#lastword
9616 2018-03-06 03:35:03 Let's see how oil prices react over the next decade.
9617 2018-03-06 03:34:09 If you can cook rice, you can cook quinoa. Do that, let it cool and mix in some diced tomatoes and avocado, add a bit of corn (frozen corn works fine) and dress it with olive oil, salt and a dash of balsamic. It’s a meal on its own. Thank me later.
9618 2018-03-06 03:34:07 I’m just worried oil will never get the respect it deserves again. I believe in oil and I also believe in weed stocks... but I see weed getting 100 PE’s before good oil socks get 20 again (I work in oil too... it’s a sad state)
9619 2018-03-06 03:33:46 @LalehKhadivi - very conscious of the impact of oil on the Middle East. How it helped to create the West & that nothing was provided back in return. #AdlWW #AdlFest

That'd be nice.

9633 2018-03-06 03:31:26 Regulators can't afford to keep their records organized, let alone oversee safety of oil, gas, coal and uranium in Texas
9634 2018-03-06 03:31:22 Lol not if we kill the trans Canada pipe line that is being built from Canada to the gulf! Oh and the oil sands project that runs from Canada to Indiana! Canada would be hurting if those get shut down. Our neighbors have become to big in the head so we have to remind them it us!
9635 2018-03-06 03:31:19 そういうことにしておこう。
9636 2018-03-06 03:31:13 Yeah, you gotta almost treat it like turkey. Whenever i do a fryer roast I do a olive oil brushing, a herb mixture of thyme/rosemary/pepper with a salt coating. Put it in a roasting pan with enough broth to soak some veggies in (carrots, potatos, celery if youre into that)
9637 2018-03-06 03:31:12 High oil prices benefit our enemies. That is why its not to much of a stretch to see that developing renewables is in our national interest.  Plus good for the environment of course
9638 2018-03-06 03:31:10 I managed to get an oil change.
9639 2018-03-06 03:31:09 And I guess you live in a cave and walk everywhere. NON of it is about the environment. Rockefellers (Standard OIL) are paying and ensuring Canadian Resources can't compete on the world market so the USA can buy them at THEIR price. Pay attention.
9640 2018-03-06 03:31:05 Guess who wrapped up her vitamins + put them in her purse so she’d remember to take them once she got to work last week? Yeah, that would be me. Guess who also forgot about them + now has a purse that smells like fish oil because her fish oil capsul exploded? Right again - me. 
9641 2018-03-06 03:30:48 @dan_murphy Last week i had a chance to study the annual financial reports of some oil companies like Suncor or Statoil.when we look into detail to those earning reports we realise how much oil companies are related to even small percentage of WTI or Brent. Thank for oil report!
9642 2018-03-06 03:30:29 OIL DIFF: 3.09 -> 3.11
9643 2018-03-06 03:30:27 I thought the whole dispute was that Alberta wanted to ship oil through a pipeline into BC? so Kenny is capitulating to the BC government

9653 2018-03-06 03:29:54 Just how much oil and gas does BC purchase from Alberta? It would be interesting to see how much of a market Alberta would be losing.
9654 2018-03-06 03:29:34 But if BC doesn’t want us to ship our oil then shouldn’t we oblige them and not ship them any oil? It’s been done before going east under the NEP.

9657 2018-03-06 03:29:22 There's lots of elections on the horizon both here and south of here...and leadership conventions but I'm not feeling as secure about these, seeing as what's going on in these oil discussions and how much it resembles Russia and 2016.

9667 2018-03-06 03:28:06 This is very iffy on ppl with oily and/or acne prone skin, it's a heavy oil so it can clog pores like a mf. (I know from experience lmao) oily/acne prone ppl should go for dryer oils on their face (jojoba/rosehip/marula) but argan oil works wonders everywhere else for sure. 
9668 2018-03-06 03:28:01 I had two mental break downs in less than an hour, so now I’m watching rupauls drag race, eating cupcakes and got my essential oil diffuser going  (lmao why did I go back to school)

9675 2018-03-06 03:27:14 Until education gets pulled off the back burner, nothing will change. It's always "do more with less" mentality. Engineering and oil are the only reasons LA stay afloat IMO. I'm not say I g I have the answer, but restructuring how our state thinks about education might help.
9676 2018-03-06 03:27:11 And I think back to the US election in 2016 where social media giants said they know what the Russians did and they put safe guards in place to prevent that from happening again, but its like oil spill equipment...where are they?
9677 2018-03-06 03:27:09 It was plain as day when he picked Tillerson. Exxon guy, lift sanctions, oil for all, money for all, and Trump gets a big cut. This admin is about 3 things, oil, money, and power. Trump, Tillerson, Pruitt, Zinke, Putin, no sanctions, Arctic, etc. It’s Big Oil’s last stand.

9679 2018-03-06 03:26:56 The DEA is adamant that all consumable hemp products are illegal [that is debatable] so either way it is IMPOSSIBLE for high CBD hemp oil to have been reasonably marketed as a dietary supplement before the IND and “substantial clinical trials made public” yet the pharmaceutical..
9680 2018-03-06 03:26:48 Let's not forget when Tony Benn was the Lab gov's Energy Minister in the early 1970's he lied that there was only 20 years of oil in the North Sea when they knew there was 40 years or more. Not for the first time that Westminster governments have lied to the people of Scotland.
9681 2018-03-06 03:26:47 خير انتي م لقي الا هيثم بعدين وش علاقته بذا الصنم خويه رايد
9682 2018-03-06 03:26:41 We as the American Public have a constitutional right to have access to high CBD hemp oil from Agricultural Hemp as a dietary supplement to maintain our health and wellness.
9683 2018-03-06 03:26:37 Patennn. Kau guna cleansing oil brand ape? Hada labo?
9684 2018-03-06 03:26:29 In exchange for this corrupt practice, the company pays the official a portion of the profits. This portion is the “kickback.” Think all the contracts awarded to companies overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen. All that "infrastructure" to rebuild. All those wells of oil.
9685 2018-03-06 03:26:18 You fool, don’t you realize how short-sighted this is!?  After all, we understand how this “BOOM” is only helping America’s wealthiest oil tycoons.  Can’t wait for @elonmusk to crush this entire industry with technological (renewables) innovation.
9686 2018-03-06 03:26:11 @MadDogRadio what was title of the book about oil in Oklahoma and Native Americans ??

9688 2018-03-06 03:26:03 And one more note while we're on the subject and since I love talking about leather goods ... LexolNF is simply Lexol with Neatsfoot oil. Neatsfoot tends to rot the stitching in leather gear which is why it isn't used much as it once was. 
9689 2018-03-06 03:25:50 i can’t sleep over at anyone’s place because I would seriously feel so awkward asking for some sugar, lemon and olive oil for my nightly diy mask

9699 2018-03-06 03:24:51 If mildew is a concern, there's an equivalent leather oil product by Rudy's that's mold-inhibiting. Out here that's not an issue so I skip it, but if you find white mold on your gear, look for that product.

9704 2018-03-06 03:24:33 Just remember the same experts that were telling us 10 years ago, we were at peak oil, that the USA was out of oil and would never be a major energy producer are now telling us how great their version of "free trade" is and how bad tariffs are.
9705 2018-03-06 03:24:31 @MadDogUnleashed Doggie whats The title of the book about oil in Oklahoma and native Americans

9710 2018-03-06 03:24:15 PSA: my VS bra leaked oil and ruined 2 shirts of mine today. (Pretty sweet). What I really want to know is what oil I was exposed to for 13 hrs today on my breast. I’m irate. I havent shopped there forever but now I’m actually throwing all of the shit I still have away.
9711 2018-03-06 03:24:13 Sure because Russian wants the US to build its military, bring back manufacturing and be the number one supplier of oil, the only commodity Russia has. If you believe that I'm sure you already own swamp land in Florida.

9714 2018-03-06 03:23:46 Oil, Gold and Coal are all scarce. But what’s more valuable is your time and energy. These are also scarce, so don’t waste your time or energy on those who don’t deserve it.

9718 2018-03-06 03:23:12 @JasonKenny At least we know now in America that Obama wasn't blowing big oil alone. It takes two.
9719 2018-03-06 03:23:06 Ok kewl, I read that putting coconut oil in your hair the night before helps too.
9720 2018-03-06 03:23:04 Create war to cause oil shortage causing increased oil price benefiting Russia. First they can trade in arms which we know was being worked on through prince and second remove sanctions and the Exxon putin oil deal goes through
9721 2018-03-06 03:23:02 What’s the deal with ENB?? I have some rrsp money sitting around but iv sworn off oil
9722 2018-03-06 03:23:01 Makes as much sense as letting those eastern bastards freeze in the dark, then complaining that they don't buy oil from us . . .

9732 2018-03-06 03:20:42 Qatar has our US Base of over10,000 Us and British Troops deployed to
protect it from Terrorism. Our former Administrations have kept a blind eye to Qatar active role in Terror only for its OIl and Location. Al Jaraza will see an end to anti-Israel Propaganda.

9742 2018-03-06 03:19:24 The best is using a combination of saddle soap to clean, then oiling it with a non-NF oil, and then finishing with a good conditioner. The best products are Rudy's by Bee Natural. I think they're far better than Lexol. I'll see if I can find you a link!

9766 2018-03-06 03:17:34 I go back to the beginning: Tillerson & Putin have a deal to drill a very hot oil field w/ Exxon capabilities. Sanctions are screwing it up. Trump is complicit in a 3 trillion $ deal.
9767 2018-03-06 03:17:27 Almost 60% of our national parks, land will be destroyed because we want oil... okay. So what’s left for the generations of Americans left after there is no oil? After the climate is completely destroyed? #ImpeachTrumpNow

9802 2018-03-06 03:11:32 $gold worst case scenario is 1200, that brings it to early 2014 level. Well $oil need to be $100. So there it is, worst case imo. But... with the amount of $$ printing that happened in last 7yrs. $GOLD is cheap at this level, might go little lower but that is it!
9803 2018-03-06 03:11:31 Next time get the skillet super hot and hot it with olive oil and butter and let those sear for a hot minute,  don’t touch,  it will release when seared.  Flip and finish.  7-9 minutes and let it rest.

9808 2018-03-06 03:10:47 You misunderstood, I'm saying if CBD oil leads to marijuana being legalized, that's a good thing, so it should happen.
9809 2018-03-06 03:10:42 It's from our graphic novel 'The Beast: Making a Living on a Dying Planet.'

9823 2018-03-06 03:09:39 CBD Oil without .3% THC is isolated cannabidiol added to a carrier oil.  It is junk.  You want to pull the extracts from the Horticultural Hemp plant with .3% THC and not have to take anything away because of the unbelievable nutritional properties of the Hemp plant.

9838 2018-03-06 03:06:48 ?why did Trump appoint Rex Tillerson, head of State, instead of someone more experienced? Is it because Tillerson has a history with Russia, Putin in particular, through oil deals on behalf of Exxon. We seem to have two “slow rollers” aiding the Russians. KNOWINGLY?

9867 2018-03-06 03:03:41 tea light candles are short lived. like how many should one use to stink the whole place up with essential oil scents through an oil burner? like too many.. duh
9868 2018-03-06 03:03:22 You can also use some oils in order to balance the natural oils from your skin. Good: argan oil, castor oil, grapeseed oil, lotus flower serum.... 
Dont use coconut oil on your face, its a clogging pore oil an can worsen your acne

9873 2018-03-06 03:02:03 The side effects of out of control THC levels are the lower appetites (sexual desire; desire for food) getting way out of whack.  It also messes with the reward system.  Trace amounts of THC in CBD Oil do not cause the side effects of out of control THC levels.

9886 2018-03-06 03:00:22 The only reason Tillerson is Secretary of State is because of his oil deals with Russia which is tied into Trump's banking interests in Russia which is the country that got him elected President. Wake up people!
9887 2018-03-06 03:00:17 Trace amounts of THC in CBD Oil are good because it allows all the many nutritional parts of the Agricultural Hemp plant to stay in the extract.  The 0 THC stuff is just isolated cannabidiol added to a carrier oil.  It is junk.  The hemp extracts are a super food.

9898 2018-03-06 02:59:13 As far as we know, Trump never even heard of Tillerson before he was nominated for SoS.  How did that decision even come about?  Especially since Trump tends to hire his friends and has no connections (that we know of) to the oil industry. #maddow
9899 2018-03-06 02:59:10 The opposite is true. High CBD oil from Agricultural Hemp will stop the spread of marijuana. You can buy marijuana off the street in every town in this country and its getting worse and worse. CBD Oil is a much better alternative without side effects of out of control THC levels.

9917 2018-03-06 02:55:51 It would at least validate their personal preference to disarm. Doing so with no education on the subject is just ignorant. 

But this is America... ignorance is a right of those who choose to be.
9918 2018-03-06 02:55:45 Please. Look at the numbers. Alberta is growing. You're too ignorant to have an intelligent debate. You're basing your opinion on you, not facts.
