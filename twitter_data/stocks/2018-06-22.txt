38 2018-06-24 23:40:25 This might be my most autistic insight yet but... errrrr aren't colonialism - "hegemony" - and democracy - self-rule - kind of antithetical to each other? Why isn't this day-glo obvious? I mean to the point of making Kagan and his ilk laughing-stocks.
39 2018-06-24 23:40:20 I stay away from penny stocks that have almost a billion shares. Tried it before. Not good outcome.

41 2018-06-24 23:33:54 Off topic but if anyone is interested in riding a small corner of the marijane wave, VTMGX keeps a small holding of related stocks. OK back to today's political horror show.
42 2018-06-24 23:32:55 See the intent in what you’re saying. 

Durability is a strong word. It implies longevity. Referencing stocks that aren’t even 20 years old is a stretch. A 20 year old person isn’t durable.

Attractive, Potential, Good investment, resilient... ok. Durability? ... need context.
43 2018-06-24 23:30:18 Yes agree with you on that. This is hard to pin down. E.g. in 2013 when Fed expanded, stocks went up. Later when fed stopped, stocks paused but then went up again in 2016-17. It may well continue to go up with QT, although my sense is this will be hard if LT rates move higher.
44 2018-06-24 23:24:38 I seriously could listen to Warren Buffet ramble on about stocks and companies ALL day.

48 2018-06-24 23:20:22 On paper, block-chain tech has some great promises. The ideas and values of crypto are fine. The execution? That leaves something to be desired. It’s too speculative and volatile for the average investor to trust. Invest the amount that you’re okay with losing. Just like stocks.
49 2018-06-24 23:19:50 A lot of them seem to be private sectors too. Seems like you have to find funds or angel investors to invest into more space focused stocks like spacex for now.

55 2018-06-24 23:14:32 The majority of wealth in the US is held in stocks/bonds, which means that the $$ is being used by people who can put it productive use. $$ sitting in banks/stocks isn't actually sitting there, it's being used to fund mortgages, car loans and business expenditures for average ppl

57 2018-06-24 23:13:53 Usually when I see a market like $SPX set up so beautifully I find a lot of stocks set up the same way. That doesn't seem to be the situation right now. A lot of mediocre setups, but not many powerhouse ones.
58 2018-06-24 23:13:44 They are calling street stocks out to run the track in. Top is a mess still.  We should've went home when it rained. They are shortening the heats n consy by 2 laps.

90 2018-06-24 22:33:17 @artek338  The way I screen for stocks is by using FINVIZ screening stocks above $5.00 with volume over 750K with volatility preset. If the set up looks right I add it to my watchlist. 

I used to use equity feed but finviz provides the same free or if you upgrade $35 a month.

103 2018-06-24 22:20:06 A common explanation I hear from 2nd Amendment advocates is that we can't take one single thing (bump stocks, AR-15s) or else we're opening the door to taking away all gun rights.  Do these same people not see that Trump's tweet about taking away due process is the same thing?

141 2018-06-24 21:39:23 I'm,.. I think he meant he would see our tariffs and raise his more. Which is the same foolish thing he has been doing. 
Word of advice, Sell your stocks and empty your bank accounts. He's going to crash the global economy.
142 2018-06-24 21:38:45 also everyone, now's the time to bet on dwindling stocks. Dow will take a major hit from this nonsense
143 2018-06-24 21:35:51 It just goes beyond reason. However I believe stocks will go down significantly anf hit the high brow MAGA retiree voters who brags how Trump helped their portfolios. RIGHT in their wallets like ice water in the face. Hear it at church of all places

148 2018-06-24 21:27:26 I don't think people understand the purpose of my 3K pack, the stocks in there is what I personally use, they are not all from my local files because I myself also use Mixo's pack.
149 2018-06-24 21:27:22 Main stocks this week will be $DRUS and $AAGC. $DRUS seeking bottom at .006 and $AAGC has been incredibly strong in the mid 2s. There is also no reason for $HVCW to be at these levels. That’s a load and hold.

155 2018-06-24 21:20:57 Yes and Obama didn't trash the economy. When he left stocks were at 19k

157 2018-06-24 21:15:04 And what are stocks again? We, people, are the ones that give them value. It's an abstract concept just like most anything.
158 2018-06-24 21:13:38 The good news is stocks in rope have gone up quite well buy now there will be quite a shortage in the months ahead
159 2018-06-24 21:10:41 Not sure how I feel about Sanders and her party at Medieval Times being forced at lance point into the stocks to be pelted with sweet buttered corn and giant turkey legs by the crowd. Not what this country is about imo

161 2018-06-24 21:05:15 October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.

184 2018-06-24 20:46:46 And the stocks for junk food are probably also up

194 2018-06-24 20:38:37 I've said that before. He says shit, market tumbles, and then usually the next day or so it rebounds and it's like they do it on purpose to snatch up stocks while they are down and 2 days later they've already made money off of them.
195 2018-06-24 20:37:38 Agreed!
196 2018-06-24 20:36:16 You poured $1.8 trillion stimulus into the economy. But wage growth’s anemic & wealth gap’s astronomic cause corporations brought back stocks with their massive tax cuts instead of investing in workers. Add an unnecessary trade war you started, then trouble’s around the corner.

199 2018-06-24 20:34:50 Tariffs were a major contributor to the Great Depression. Remember while Trump and his cronies short stocks and make big money on the Market, the rest of us get screwed. This corrupt joker needs to go...fast!
200 2018-06-24 20:34:23 Hey @PressSec, back in colonial times people who were guilty of crimes against society were put in the stocks to be pelted with rotten food. You’re whining about being asked to leave a restaurant? Can we go back to stocks then, just for you?
201 2018-06-24 20:33:37 Well yeah. It’s all you ever talk about. And your like my only twitter bestie friend. And You got stocks there and shit.
202 2018-06-24 20:32:57 Through my company's 401K, yes. Then we go elsewhere to invest. We seem to be on target by most metrics, but I definitely hate dealing with funds and stocks and investments.
203 2018-06-24 20:32:21 Okay, lets take a look at those energy stocks...
204 2018-06-24 20:32:01 Very interesting indeed... it appears buying stocks with potential turnaround.. thank you for sharing..
205 2018-06-24 20:31:42 Even the fast food brands doing deals everyone was going crazy for 2 weeks ago. You can't buy their stocks directly in JA, but you can buy stocks in JA companies that support those brands. Love Burger King? They sell Wata. Buy Wisynco...

210 2018-06-24 20:24:58 Nope. Because @davidhogg111 never said anything about "taking all guns away" or "stopping armed security professionals".  What he said was: Introduce sensible gun control for automated machine guns and bump stocks. But nice try on changing the narrative.
211 2018-06-24 20:23:20 Purposely sending the foreign stocks in a tailspin by cutting trade ties? Not sure if that's going to work but we'll see. It's crazy enough to work, I'm behind you 100% no matter what happens.
212 2018-06-24 20:22:57 Please I have stocks I bought with first bank as far back as 2002/2003 I think I need to do some back tracking on my shares.

214 2018-06-24 20:22:14 I agree. The pharmacy either stocks the medication or they don’t. That should be the deciding factor in fulfilling a prescription request. If a pharmacist wants more control than that, they should open their own pharmacy.

226 2018-06-24 20:08:23 Seems kinda harsh to say it, but many folks of born/blk tend to have nice cars, over how white folks tend to buy houses & stocks.
Many poorer white folk safe just lied to about how their economy gets ruined.
If brn/blk in nice cars cops say why?
If white, cops don't see you.

255 2018-06-24 19:28:55 I've spent the last week or so building a price projection model. Very fun project. It projects stock price based off prices of other companies with strong correlation. As the market changes so does the projection. This is viable not only for pot stocks, but all sectors.
256 2018-06-24 19:27:56 I wish them no harm except to watch them squirm as they’re publicly put in the stocks and pelted with rotten veggies. Metaphorically speaking.

269 2018-06-24 19:14:25 Down to tags ends regarding current EPS reporting period. Reports start up in earnest on 7/16 with NFLX. Residential Building & construction weak. Energy showing RS, healthcare as well. NASDAQ McClellan,$NASI, oscillator flashing caution sign after a 7 week run in growth stocks.
270 2018-06-24 19:14:22 Buy more of my current favorite MJ stocks: MPX, CRZ, LHS, TRTC, KSHB

272 2018-06-24 19:13:07 I have a great Asian supermarket near me that stocks mainly Chinese, Thai and Korean food, so I should be able to get them there  (my kingdom for a Japanese store, however...)
273 2018-06-24 19:11:56 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
274 2018-06-24 19:11:54 She had no power to sell uranium. Russia possesses the world's largest stockpile of highly enriched uranium. Only 26 countries have stocks of highly enriched uranium, but Russia has the distinction of being the sole country producing it for export. they sell it, not buy it.
275 2018-06-24 19:11:37 Many people, including members of Congress, did not know bump stocks existed until the Las Vegas mass shooting. Federal gov't still has not banned the bump stock even with broad support among voters. Advocating doing nothing because laws might go too far is a recipe for death.
276 2018-06-24 19:11:34 All TRUMPUBLICANS & Dems N the House & Senate need to reveal & make public their Stocks in Private Prisons & other Companies Profiting From this Round Up.  Including Private Security, Transportation, Food Preparation, Tent Manufacturers that supply this type of Private Jails
277 2018-06-24 19:11:33 So 48% of americans are in the stock market and thats a noyhing burger to you? Now whose ignoring reality. Stocks are up, so retirees are seeing more return on their retirement, which is a great thing for the elderly. 401ks are up which is great for middle class workers
278 2018-06-24 19:08:27 You ban bump stocks today, you ban handguns tomorrow. No can do.
279 2018-06-24 19:07:50 We all have extra stocks.

282 2018-06-24 19:03:53 I'm feeling like stocks will crash in the next 3-36 months, and bonds will go down with the coming stagflation. What to do?

But when we live in a polluted global warming survivalist hellscape, and the US dollar won't buy a bowl of borscht, then it's not gonna matter anyway!
283 2018-06-24 19:00:46 @Guntalk Reminder to everyone, public comment deadline for ATF ruling banning bump stocks is Wednesday June 27.

291 2018-06-24 18:54:35 Beat to get advice from someone who knows more than me I said bullish in that in Dec everyone was talking about Crypto - you know the saying, sell when the taxi driver sells you stocks. So the opposite applies when people are not interested, that said we may still be going down
292 2018-06-24 18:53:29 How do you obtain your PT on ATH stocks?

297 2018-06-24 18:49:55 Don't assume. If price always reflected value then there would be no "value stocks" ... Ask @WarrenBuffett about his views on price and value!

That said, let folks pay whatever price they want for whatever value they perceive. That's the beauty of a free market.
298 2018-06-24 18:48:36 For those buying shares in his trade stocks, time to sell!
299 2018-06-24 18:47:50 too dramatic. people were not investing 600bn $ between 2014 and 2018. "marketcap" of crypto is subject of same distortion as stocks: prices reflect only the traded unit. invest in fiat is only part of traded units (hodlers, velocity). most has been crypto still..many got burned.
300 2018-06-24 18:46:32 Let's trade options on stocks now
301 2018-06-24 18:45:42 Guess the Great Recession of 2008 made you rich? Was great for ur retirement fund. I lost half of my fund. We are heading there again. Anyone who thinks doing the same things over will create a different result is insane. 35% stocks owned by foreigners. More than 1/2 not invested
302 2018-06-24 18:42:03 Do not send these political juggling of him again, in the eyes of being the victims of his MLM brainwashing is completely another story. They will not like you to say that the stocks they buy will inevitably collapse.
303 2018-06-24 18:41:46 Also I'd add while AAU stats have translated fairly well in past year, I wouldn't say they are the holy grail. Especially considering the problematic data entry at these circuits. However, if there was one stat I'd say is most dependable, it's stocks. Good stocks always project
304 2018-06-24 18:40:04 people just don't want to play vs sonic and bayo and be down 2 stocks tbh. wouldn't wish that on anyone

320 2018-06-24 18:24:16 Trump is so crooked   check his stocks to see if he owns part of the private prison system he has set up for these kids.
321 2018-06-24 18:23:28 The above may only hold true for Intraday and BTST trading in stocks, futures and options
322 2018-06-24 18:22:30 Without evidence? Yes, i would expect them to not beleive it. Lol. Jobs R up, debt down, stocks up, unemployment down, but dems think they will win on trump hate. Enjoy that blue wave, sucker. U hv been scammed. maga

327 2018-06-24 18:17:04 Man, I don't know what I was thinking investing in tech stocks. I should have invested in private prisons.

333 2018-06-24 18:10:44 Question: Should children be separated from parents if the parents violated a law against owning bump stocks without a license?
334 2018-06-24 18:08:39 Would i be right in thinking that the market might get spooked as these things unfold and they realise they have to get in sharpish and the stocks will explode on the panic?I feel were nearing that time soon
335 2018-06-24 18:08:38 Their stocks already got hit hard because of the switch ordeal so I dont know why Epic Games didnt see this as a sign
336 2018-06-24 18:08:25 Expiry week could be exciting for #Nifty50. Bullish engulfing on Friday along with bullish reversal /bullish formation in Nifty stocks like #ITC #HDFCBANK #HDFC #SUNPHARMA #LUPIN #DRREDDY #M&M #BAJFINANCE #BAJFINSERV could mean Nifty climbing 11K with ease.

341 2018-06-24 18:03:27 Also, there is no evidence corporations are investing. They are using their tax cuts to buy back their stocks instead of hiring more people.
342 2018-06-24 18:03:21 The piles and stocks of 'Why' stands in my way.
343 2018-06-24 18:03:13  OMG, it's amazing! Imagine it all fixed up to its full glory. We are bummed as my husband's company was set to move downtown and rehab a building, but stocks fell and they had to pull the plug on the project.
344 2018-06-24 18:01:24 Violate 10's of thousands of people's basic human rights. These rights are guaranteed by their creator, Jesus Christ. Then, they find a way to profit from this evil by populating 'for profit prisons' that all their friends own and have stocks in. You are being lied to and used!

350 2018-06-24 17:57:51 wth, i looked at some other posts on this, this is not acceptable. If an airline did that in US there stocks would plumit. Are they keeping you guys in airport terminal still?
351 2018-06-24 17:57:36 Owning anything other than #Bitcoin is incredibly stupid. BTW I am including all other asset classes globally, Stocks, real estate, Bonds., Gold. and anything else you can name. Remember I said this.
352 2018-06-24 17:56:46 Movie Pass and similar business does not need to sell products/services above the costs, why do you need profit when investors will plug the hole with free money!

354 2018-06-24 17:56:25 Then "hodling" has absolutely nothing to do with trading. Telling people to trade and not hodl fundamentally sound things (stocks, good crypto) is just dangerously bad advice. If you're not 0.1% good or the one pushing the market you'll get rekt trading.

357 2018-06-24 17:53:38 Unemployment is not the economy. Stocks just had their biggest drop last week in 40 years. Wages only up 8 cents/ hr. 1st quarter 2018. Consumer sales lowest in 5 years, gas prices & interests up. Best indicator of economy is GDP & dropped to 2.2% 1st quarter 2018.
358 2018-06-24 17:53:15 Biggest investment has been in buying back stocks to increase share value. Higher CEO salary. No real income increase for working class.

380 2018-06-24 17:26:53 Correct, that is including only stocks, if one chooses options, it can be a whole different game.
381 2018-06-24 17:26:51 No it just had a stock split and I bought it and held it until it doubled. Sold it and bought other stocks and bought it back when the price fell to something cheap enough for me to see it rising above it again. So far it's slow but pays dividends so I'm enjoying those pay days

389 2018-06-24 17:19:23 1 million percent agree! Best time to buy stocks is when the market crashes. Most value in solving problems is when they’re the deepest and most plentiful. If you’re a problem solver looking to build an empire solving problems... this is the best time to be alive...

There are 88,000 alcohol related deaths a year.  Yet we are much more passionate about banning assault rifles than alcohol.  Does that make sense to you.

413 2018-06-24 17:00:28 Seems like a lot of fake news & deception going around; this story is the new one I’m trying to crack. 

..so far just seems like more smoke and mirrors from the Bears.  They want to refer to it as “toxic financing” so they have one more point to bash about, which is not true.

415 2018-06-24 16:59:26 This week we will see what happens with the Chinese stocks . They should consolidate $HUYA $IQ 33-40. But $BILI made a nice hammer on Friday and should go a little bit higher this week. $ETSY $ROKU I think dont do much . Need to watch close all recent Chinese IPOs.
416 2018-06-24 16:58:51 When prisons are about profits we have no justice. Private prison stocks up 100% since Trump took office. Let me repeat...we have no justice.

467 2018-06-24 16:10:21 People are willing to go $100,000 in debt for a degree that doesn’t guarantee a job right.  

But think investing $5,000 in crypto, stocks and real estate is to risky. 

If you want to be the 1%, you must do what the other 99% don’t.

544 2018-06-24 15:09:11 I agree, ego’s get large, and I wish to see more collaboration on a few single companies for better potential momentum versus everyone trying to preach about their own find. The best runs on stocks happen when multiple influencers are on the same ticker. IMO
545 2018-06-24 15:08:39 Yes you did. Sell your BTC and invest in stocks. You can also trade currencies. I heard the Argentine Peso is hot right now.

PS: If BTC goes above $50K, I'd definitely invest back into BTC. 
546 2018-06-24 15:07:45 you're missing the point completely. People are unhappy with the format we have now because matches end so fast unless you're playing vs a campy player, we could definitely have played 3 stocks if these characters didn't exist lmao. Campy play is too powerful in this game and,
547 2018-06-24 15:07:32 In Colonial times... Ms Wilkinson's hasty actions might result in acts of extreme public humiliation - stocks & pilloried... dunking booths... tarring & feathering and, of course Salem MASS preferred a more drastic retribution... BURN THE WITCH! ...
548 2018-06-24 15:06:53 One big advantage for America and London is that it attracts lot of foreign capital as Bank Savings, Private or government Bonds, Realestate investment, Stocks investment, Tourism etc... And one more thing American and British manpower is worldwide salable product too.
549 2018-06-24 15:03:56 That is exactly what the Keynesians talk about, we live in a monetary economy where nominal flows and stocks matter. The problem arises when number of people don't want to spend, they want to hoard money. The capitalists cannot sell their product, unemployment etc
550 2018-06-24 15:03:11 We will have a halving of rewards in 2020, of course, but the principle will remain the same.
Stocks & bonds pay dividends to investors. Bitcoin, on the opposite, requires investors to pay in order to remain at the same price. If you think that's incredibly stupid, you're right.
551 2018-06-24 15:02:21 1 Bitcoin equals $5,925.00 lower digits coming... imagine $btc #btc turns into ETF types selloff OR ONE OF THE SHIPPING STOCKS THAT KEEP GOING DOWN... $tops $dcix $egle $drys

578 2018-06-24 14:18:33 I think because they use Vision clearing which offers better short locates, especially for the smaller cap stocks.

667 2018-06-24 12:47:02 3 Stocks That Could Make You Rich: I think that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Welltower (NYSE:WELL), and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) are three stocks that could make investors rich over the long run.

685 2018-06-24 12:29:27 How did you find stocks like that ?
686 2018-06-24 12:28:38 William, there are a few problems with what you've said that suggest you might need to do a bit more research.
The quotas are there to maintain stocks. In or out, there will still be quotas. Since fish don't respect borders, I'd guess those quotas will be agreed internationally.
687 2018-06-24 12:26:14 I mean you might as well say the stock market is inflated by insolvent usd, backed by nothing. they print more, pump stocks. most of it is just ious...

694 2018-06-24 12:13:41 Financially: If you want some sense of security, save your money. If you want a chance at personal freedom and personal power, invest.  

Educate yourself. Don’t let “experts” discourage you with complexity. Investments, Stocks, Tech, Branding, selling etc can be simplified.
695 2018-06-24 12:13:36 Tech stocks over the past 8 years though...

705 2018-06-24 12:04:17 Is it possible to hold currency for such.long spells like stocks
706 2018-06-24 12:02:49 Answer: In general, it will track the mining cycle depending on the demand/supply curve.  As for junior mining stocks, potential Tier 1 projects with the right prerequisites at inception tend to do best. From the Brent Cook playbook? Also, the right hot commodities with EV cycle.
707 2018-06-24 12:01:35 The head of the DOJ shouldn’t own stocks in anything to do with the criminal justice system! He literally PROFITS from every decision that leads to incarceration.

734 2018-06-24 11:29:58 Better open up your mind to what’s going on. Look at the private prison stocks. ( up @12%) Trump’s policies cost $300 per day as opposed to effective $25 per day ( ankle bracelet used and families return to court. Oh, I’m only the Jesus kind of commie, love your neighbor kind.

739 2018-06-24 11:25:58 Crypto better stop going down or Canadian crypto stocks will soon try to trade below zero.

3. Do you think this technology/market will be more or less a part of our lives in 3 years.

814 2018-06-24 09:22:42 Kindly elaborate the reasons due to which IDBI bank became junk. Is it because of previous Govt. or current Govt ? LIC has the history of investing when the stocks are at its lowest, it earns huge profits due to such actions only. LIC bailed out the share market during 2008 
815 2018-06-24 09:20:35 that s called "pump the fang" to make all looking fine

5-6 stocks up big, that s not the sp, it's just pumping the most heavy weights to prevent sp falls apart.

you might want to check equal weight spx vs mkt cap weight spx to get a clue
816 2018-06-24 09:18:46 With time, I now am more focused on the momentum stocks with good reputation and clean records. That helps a lot!
817 2018-06-24 09:17:57 Previously I used to be fascinated with stocks like adanipower, jaypee, gmr, kingfisher, suzlon which are available at low prices, over the years have learnt that they have too much debt / management not able to manage companies well and that's the reason for their low prices.

821 2018-06-24 09:16:31 @MikeTokes What if Dow hits 26,500 by the end of 2018? Do investors pull money out of stocks when they seek safer asset classes such as bonds & also do bond prices fall & bond yields rise if it looks like inflation is moving higher? (A lot of (?)'s if a Trade War starts!)

849 2018-06-24 08:39:51 No matter which technique you use in picking stocks..
Successful investing professionals have two things in common..
First, they are disciplined and consistent, refusing to change their approach even when it is unfashionable..

852 2018-06-24 08:35:30 Back then (post 2001) my approach was elliottwave based approach to trading. My focus was in cash segment and never ventured into derivatives or intra day trading. This was after blowing up the account shorting IT stocks during late 1990s.

860 2018-06-24 08:16:37 When I first began investing in stocks I lost money because I had no idea what I was doing. Those lessons continued over time and eventually those losses turned into winners and pulled me away from the lack of direction I had in high school. Literally led me out of poverty.

907 2018-06-24 06:48:40 Yes, I consider holding anything you expect to rise in value to be an investment: BTC, USD, stocks, oil, garden seeds, bullets, Beanie Babies, etc.

Whether any turns out to be a *good* investment depends only on future performance vs your expectations.

912 2018-06-24 06:44:06 Education is an investment and you should be able to choose who manages your port folio and demand high ROI. If stocks fall drop it and switch focus.
913 2018-06-24 06:39:17 “Whatever methods you use to pick stocks, your success will depend on your ability to ignore the worries of the world long enough to allow your stocks to succeed. No matter how intelligent you are, it isn’t the head but the stomach that will determine your fate.” - Peter Lynch
914 2018-06-24 06:37:15 I’d look to previous bubbles as a guide: BTC 2013, dotcom stocks 2001, etc. Neither of these quickly made all time highs after bottom. I expect more downward price pressure until 1) tether is shutdown and 2) more use cases for crypto are found. Then btc will slowly rise again IMO
915 2018-06-24 06:34:31 @danfornace can you add a visual effect for all stages similar to Aethereal Gates when it comes down to tornament stocks

(For exaple make merchant port start having rough waves, cloudy, & raining or for tower of heaven make it the break of dawn.)
916 2018-06-24 06:30:25 A bit more complicated than that unfortunately. Best plan in my opinion is to have a clear strategy with realistic goals (eg. growth stocks vs dividend stocks, etc). I would look for good companies that are valued cheaply, like oil stocks were last year and diversify/be hedged.
917 2018-06-24 06:30:23 To be fair melee is much more optimised practically making stage picks a pain in the ass

Though I think some of smash 4’s ledge trap game are so stupidly strong that you might lose a stock to it. Which makes 2 stocks a bit of an issue
918 2018-06-24 06:29:39 ...Having Trump as our Presient has accomplished one important factor. It has shown us who the hateful mother-f***ers REALLY are. Lot of tantrums being thrown from the left these days. Pampers stocks must be through the roof by now!

920 2018-06-24 06:24:21 The number one reason 90% of traders fail, in my opinion, is because they get emotionally compromised.

So learn to limit your size in any position so that fear does not become the prevailing instinct guiding your judgment.

924 2018-06-24 06:20:50 Probably, but no one knows exactly when. Trying to time the market is usually a bad idea. What is for certain is that stocks are near all time highs in terms of price/earnings, so manage your risk accordingly. Good luck!

934 2018-06-24 06:00:50 In equity markets beginners focus on never ending stock selection while professionals focus on eliminating bad stocks from their winning portfolio. That's the key.

Our economy is strong. U bapparently dont read the stocks or conversions or a damn newspaper. Unreal. U believe ur libs b.s.

946 2018-06-24 05:36:05 Ross, I have heard that a lot of stocks get restricted with suretrader. I am looking for some reassurance that if I open a suretrader acct that there are still a reasonable amount stocks that are unrestricted.

949 2018-06-24 05:31:46 Yeah, they’re also selling hope to a fan base, which this does in spades. He’s in the top three spec stocks in the league, if not a clear No.1, and he’s already on their list. It’s beautiful for them.
950 2018-06-24 05:31:04 Pay off my college debt, help my parents with bills, buy them a new house/vehicle, invest some in stocks and set back the rest for life. I'd rather work for my money

952 2018-06-24 05:28:55 The Somali government must fight against the charcoal dealers same way it fights alshabab. This is absolute disaster to our land, people, and live stocks. It is completely destroying our existence to live in this country if this continues. The whole country is becoming Sahara!

954 2018-06-24 05:25:28 I dunno how conducive that border area is for large scale armoured operations. Probably not. Norway will have F-35 and a host of other assets never mind the stocks of pre-postioned US equipment under the mountains. Air superiority is key to whether you can operate tanks or not.

961 2018-06-24 05:20:15 #SundayConfessions 

In the 12 years of investing my BIGGEST blunder so far has been to try to reduce the valuation of my overall portfolio by moving to lower valuation stocks. 
I tried it after the 2010 rally & by the end of the 2011 correction portfolio got slaughtered!
962 2018-06-24 05:18:26 Except the press?
963 2018-06-24 05:17:58 Day trading isn’t just stocks, it can be crypto and forex also
964 2018-06-24 05:17:55 Bill, Thanks for lowering stock prices on oil companies so I can purchase more stocks and get more dividends. That’s how the market economy works. :)
965 2018-06-24 05:14:49 It's stocks maybe I misunderstood I thought you were saying investing in stocks I used to trade on nadex it's stocks but more just gambling if it's gonna be under or over a certain amount
966 2018-06-24 05:14:11 I know trumps s traitor.
967 2018-06-24 05:12:59 Day trading is stocks

972 2018-06-24 05:06:31 STILL full of shit, Ari!
973 2018-06-24 05:03:36 Follow the money as they say.
I find it disgusting that these stocks soared this week?
Up more than 10% this month most of it this week. All while paying an almost 8% dividend. All you need are blinders earplugs and no soul to invest and you too can be rich!
974 2018-06-24 05:03:24 The grey patches located on the stocks are visible from my colourful hot air balloon

I use my balloon to water existing crops, sow seeds and throw bugs on my enemies' land plots
975 2018-06-24 05:03:12 Totally agree.  This point is getting lost.  Stocks have income, growth, agg growth...coins JUST have demand generation...never give off cash.

Secondarily, sustainability to ensure mining support, governance, etc.

985 2018-06-24 04:52:21 Ha ha. amidst all his lectures, all his stocks are down by 30% .. atleast in my portfolio managed by him
986 2018-06-24 04:50:19 A Derating can easily follow a rerating. 

But, stocks can't swiftly show a rerating after a derating. 

But, our hopes tend to be kept alive by house brokers, anchor investors and fund managers.

We fall in slow motion.
987 2018-06-24 04:49:49 I fucked around and bought stocks I am basically adulting
988 2018-06-24 04:48:47 Literally nothing you said can be proved, and unless you invested in international stocks, you didn’t make a red cent this year in a general investment. I asked for data. You gave none. Military has been getting raises throughout. Where is your proof?
989 2018-06-24 04:48:27 While Family’s are torn apart big winners are two public co stocks soaring 10% this week paying 7% dividend with gov contracts... our tax money. Corrupt Institutional ownership -shame on greedy devils.
990 2018-06-24 04:48:03 that's what the counters are saying. They said they no longer have the stocks and the promo ended a while back. 
Why doesn't good things last forever ?? 
991 2018-06-24 04:45:35 So, the strangest feature of this game is that the values of the stocks during a round (when you're buying and selling) are basically imaginary. There's a reckoning at the end of a round where the poker hands are assessed and the stocks adjust to their REAL values
992 2018-06-24 04:43:13 Matthew Perry the computer science teacher is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is eaten and digested by Cameron.
993 2018-06-24 04:39:17 Stirling was famous for its stocks.
994 2018-06-24 04:36:42 I have no idea why but some people dont view the "F" stocks as "US enough" even though theyre some of the best companies operating here. And Canadians dont like them bc "theyre not LPs".
 
MPX is now both. + when those numbers come out alot of people will be amazed.
995 2018-06-24 04:32:33 Fuckin 9 to 5 fascists
996 2018-06-24 04:29:06 My god. I can't believe I never ever thought of learning or being taught options. What I could have did with this type of info at 16 man... really considering messaging Ledbetter and asking him if I can just have one day to teach stocks and options to the students!
997 2018-06-24 04:27:44 Agreed, but futures and stocks carry more risk as there is little mechanism to hedge risk and generate returns simultaneously!
998 2018-06-24 04:26:11 Can people stop picking temple for squad assault when its 3 stocks and heart containers on
999 2018-06-24 04:25:08 random SFV thoughts
ibuki VT2 should take 3 stocks, not 2

the hit/block sounds (and the block animation) in the game are really unsatisfying and make it feel clunkier. should borrow from ST/3S in what they did to make things feel more dynamic

1001 2018-06-24 04:11:48 All of the stores stocks are down and stores will have to close.  A typical democrat..pops off with the mouth without researching first.
1002 2018-06-24 04:05:58 It all depends on the retainer agreement - Bill Gates and other Billionaires usually empower a lawyer that fixes the voluminous and frivolous lawsuits that are filed against them, and they stay out of the process for publicity reasons -bad press makes stocks fall. Very common.

1021 2018-06-24 03:30:20 Hi Jiten. What is your take on infrastructure stocks? Is it another cyclical waiting to roll
1022 2018-06-24 03:30:05 So I have to ask do you own @krispykreme stocks. If not they should give you some for promoting them all the time.
1023 2018-06-24 03:29:10 *takes up abm*

1024 2018-06-24 03:27:29 Where the hell do you live the only time my stock options started making a return was November 2016.. anytime before then stocks were constantly taking a hit and medical insurance has been through the roof along with the big deductibles to match
1025 2018-06-24 03:26:54 yeah I can't believe people will just steal someones child right in front of them
1026 2018-06-24 03:25:57 A pot stock?  Really?  This is not a forever stock, Tim. Once everyone figures out how harmful pot is and what negative impact it is having on our society, these stocks will PLUNGE. All it takes is one or two negative events.
1027 2018-06-24 03:25:01 So I lost 3 stocks to bowser junior f smash at ledge 3 times and it caught my up b........... guess I got 129th
1028 2018-06-24 03:24:22 The problem is the tax cuts are also used by companies to buy back stocks, inflating their price, which will cause another crash.
1029 2018-06-24 03:24:04 Took 2 stocks from Mr R this time and one of them was with Zelda dair :D
1030 2018-06-24 03:22:45 This is what is happening in most of the stocks these days :)
1031 2018-06-24 03:21:06 Hirap ng wala ka pang stocks tapos breakfast na 
1032 2018-06-24 03:20:08 I'm all for stocks, dunking, ear nailing (over 15), thieves hole... 
1033 2018-06-24 03:18:39 Companies are buying back stocks and the only wage increase is a few dollars because of tax tables. Meanwhile states are dealing with budget shortfalls especially in education.
1034 2018-06-24 03:17:27 ええな、帰ったらさわってみるわ
1035 2018-06-24 03:17:06 My CALL Options would love that & I feel it could be true 2. But the odd thing is we have a 9.9% (14,900,000) share short pos (5x other sector stocks) against UEC 2. So, a complete "contradiction" in trading stances at the same time.  I sense Squeeze coming if a Catalyst hits.
1036 2018-06-24 03:16:42 It’s 2-stock because of viewers. It’s why Cloud got banned in doubles (while MK was busted in Brawl yet stuck around), from my perspective. 3-stocks can take time and depending on the match-ups, leads to more camping.

Don’t mind me though. Just a thought.
1037 2018-06-24 03:14:52 أستاذ نجيب ممكن نصيحة على البورصة انا بفكر استثمر ٣ آلاف دولار في الpenny stocks

1040 2018-06-24 03:11:41 yeah, it's actually not that big, but it's actually more people (individuals) buying BTC than buying stocks (seriously)

1045 2018-06-24 03:05:08 I just cant get hype for upsets in smash 4, with 2 stocks, rage, mu infamiliarity due to 50+ mus you gotta know. They just dont seem legit a lot of the time.

1047 2018-06-24 03:03:00 Neither. It's actually the lodger staying in one of the rooms on the house on the right ...no car, stocks, assets, totally cashed out into government insured current accounts, holding a diverse crypto portfolio, tweeting, shitposting and simply waiting for the next moon season :)
1048 2018-06-24 02:59:54 @timothysykes do you mainly short penny stocks or go long.  What pct of each.  I just can’t see sustained value in going long on sub 100M market cap companies.

1052 2018-06-24 02:55:45 Bit off topic but Googles made changes to various features such as gmail & more. One item I really liked & used was their finance page. But it went from having the ability of tracking stocks & price changes, yes you could even enter price you paid. And now it's just a newsy page
1053 2018-06-24 02:55:04 I await the Second Great Depression. It has been stewing for a while. The last recession was a housing market hiccup that caused countries to fail, dropped stocks markets around the world, closed big investments banks, and cost billions in bailouts. And that was a hiccup.
1054 2018-06-24 02:54:36 Did investing in those stocks pay off?
1055 2018-06-24 02:53:56 Hope gullible newbie investors don't see these price targets and keep their 2018 upside target of their portfolio as 50%... I guess on an average the stocks have a 50% upside
1056 2018-06-24 02:52:13 There's two types of deskmate:
1. The one who always ask for testpad
2. The one who have endless stocks of testpad
1057 2018-06-24 02:52:08 Ban bump stocks
1058 2018-06-24 02:52:07 Since Obama LEGALIZED bump stocks, yet another mess you want cleaned up?
1059 2018-06-24 02:50:36 Well since some of them are already in a foster home associated with Betsy's family;  and since private prison stocks are soaring;  I am guessing is that the plan is to have the government reimburse Republican's for their "care."
1060 2018-06-24 02:50:06 First save 5Million then invest 500k in stocks and bonds then I would open a couple salons and charge per booth then buy some condos are apt complexes and renovate them and rent them out then I would start flipping actual houses. After all that I would help the homeless n travel.

1070 2018-06-24 02:39:19 Let me know if you agree that many gun owners: shake responsibility, play fast and lose with gun laws, are under trained, tend to look for ways around laws in place (bump stocks), tend to not keep positive control of their firearms, if not required to do something dont. I see it.

1072 2018-06-24 02:36:05 Honestly wasn’t that impressed.   It’s built for a basic mutual fund portfolio,  not a large portfolio of stocks.   Great concept,  but needs work.
1073 2018-06-24 02:35:47 Oh ya let them delve in stocks, 401ks, and a balanced passive interest longterm portfolio.

1086 2018-06-24 02:14:12 Its so funny. So many retail investors buy stocks just by watching business chsnnels analysts in a bull mkt. And irony is in a bear market they r again back to them to ask about the future of the stocks bought. Hope investing was so easy.Can wealth be built on borrowed knowledge?
1087 2018-06-24 02:14:10 How stoplosses of masses benifits few?

1091 2018-06-24 02:06:34 @realDonaldTrump N His genius business mind will EVENTUALLY hav  wealthier than it has ever been Yet N meantime,maybe several years, there will be higher prices, stocks will drop SOME,Profits wont be as much. So be prepared 4 this BUT N long run  WINS

1094 2018-06-24 02:03:24 Not really a weed stock guy to be honest. I feel like there is an unlimited amount of hype and euphoria behind them. $WEED.TO is $CGC on the us markets.

1103 2018-06-24 01:43:01 They kinda have to keep it that way to mitigate the fact that there's really campy characters in smash 4 and edge guarding isnt really good compared to melee. Which means stocks last significantly longer and spectators lose interest.
1104 2018-06-24 01:42:14 Market and trading can't be promised all fake claims but if one learns timing levels and when to trade sure wins trading is fully focussed job never do trade with other jobs #intraday #Daytrader #stocks
1105 2018-06-24 01:37:49 Sure - stocks may fall ahead of the next recession, or they may plateau if the economy goes through a soft landing.

Meanwhile, those who dug into rabbit holes for the last 10 years, out of lazy ignorance or naive belief in conspiracy theories, have missed on 10 years of gains.
1106 2018-06-24 01:36:54 Right. They aren't cooperative enough to do it with no promise of future reward: money, stocks, prestige, etc.

1112 2018-06-24 01:26:22 Same with stocks.
1113 2018-06-24 01:26:02 Yes, ban bump stocks.
1114 2018-06-24 01:24:28 Massive unfunded tax cuts went to corporations w/record profits who used it to buy back stocks & help themselves not create jobs.

Since you have no investments you get no trickle down

When I realized during bull mkt you have two choices 1 - Buy/sell hundreds of stocks over a multi year bull run - lots of work, high stress, fear of missing out leads you to take marginal set ups. 2 - buy multi year base breakouts to new highs and hold. Option 2
1187 2018-06-23 23:54:39 Only use Dollar Cost Averaging when you're buying dips... and you should only be buying when there are dips. #trading #stocks #bitcoin #blockchain #crypto #cryptocurrency #ValueInvesting
1188 2018-06-23 23:54:21 So...at today’s rate you invest 50,000 on ONT for a chance to earn 15K a year on something that may or may not exist 5 years from now. Seems way to risky. Dividends are great but they are icing on the cake (whether stocks or crypto).
1189 2018-06-23 23:53:45 I’m thinking ALL those creeps made sure they had stocks in the detention centre system that trump invented.
They committed insider trading on this one boys and girls.
That reminds me! Have they stashed the teen girls in a “special” place for SPECIAL ATTENTION?
Pretty boys, too???
1190 2018-06-23 23:53:22 That was a BIG deal in my younger years. Walk around the place with a stalk. It was refreshing. Then again, it didn't take the edge off being locked in the stocks one year...
1191 2018-06-23 23:52:29 my dad might have screwed up in many regards but i know a shitload abt stocks and shares so at least i got some useful knowledge
1192 2018-06-23 23:50:29 For publicly traded and owned companies I can see the choice being stripped from them due to being publicly owned, but a private business with no stocks or loans against it, should be able to choose their clients.
1193 2018-06-23 23:49:11 It is more complicated than that. I made decisions to buy stocks for my SMSF based on the rules which are in place. Changing the rules will damage my retirement plan. I will still vote Labor, but I believe that this change should be grandfathered somehow.
1194 2018-06-23 23:48:54 @PMOIndia @FinMinIndia Govt should bring down STT to just @0.01% on all kinds of electronic transactions (commodity or stocks) only to put a mark of authenticity and not for collection of revenue. Then allow international trades w/o burden of tax on bourses operating from GIFT.

1240 2018-06-23 23:13:44 Well, that clears it up. Thank you for your financial advice. Question: should I invest in coal? It’s such a HUGE industry that I’m afraid I won’t be able to crack in to the amazing stocks.
1241 2018-06-23 23:13:27 Matter.
Police kill more power only one even knew that “a strain of firearms stocks) more or military coup d'etat before
1242 2018-06-23 23:11:15 And how would that affect all the money people currently have in banks/stocks would there be a even transfer or just fuck everyone?

1244 2018-06-23 23:10:06 Charles McLellan has a fine vessel on the stocks at Pugwash, well advanced. The ceiling is all in and the hurricane decks have been put on. The vessel is about 140 feet keel, has a very small draught, and is of unusually wide build. Jun 23 1899

1250 2018-06-23 23:04:16 I couldn't live off the interest of 2 mil if thats the total liquidity you have, unless youre nuts. Who would invest 100% of your capital into stocks to get the yearly return? It's to scary. If you had 4 million total that's a different story, but why live on the intest then.
1251 2018-06-23 23:03:36 Today i found out that if you get birks stocks wet they will stain your feet orange!

1253 2018-06-23 23:00:20 Now where me and you absolutely agree is changing a semi to as close a full auto as possible. Bump stocks, trigger fillings, etc these are absolutely designed to do as much damage as possible. Most are already illegal but more can be done and should be done in this regard

1275 2018-06-23 22:46:16 Its a pity no one thinks your idea is worth a shot, or that it would trigger lasting change. You really could have brought the hammer down on this guys at the NRA. Glad you didn’t shell out any money buying gun stocks.

1278 2018-06-23 22:45:03 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1279 2018-06-23 22:44:32 I'm so sorry you think that. I take it you rely on Fox news for your information. 83% of the tax cuts benefit the rich permanently. North Korea is still a threat. The "optimism" in the stock market is because corporations now have the tax break money to buy back their own stocks.

1315 2018-06-23 22:06:38 Well you will be excited not to know you are losing Social Security and Medicare and they are getting rid of pre existing conditions so you will pay big time if you have any!  So great.
1316 2018-06-23 22:06:27 @davidhogg111 Mr. Hogg, I see you going after bump stocks, how about going after the 1.6 million a year crashes that cause 400k death due to teens texting & driving. How about the 5k deaths per year due to underage drinking & driving. What about the near 700k AUD adolescents?
1317 2018-06-23 22:01:37 Nah, by then it's just a money-losing busted growth story when Audi, Mercedes, Jaguar & Porsche are turning Teslas into embarrassment-mobiles. Lots of Internet stocks wound up selling "at cash" or below.

1319 2018-06-23 22:00:11 You know nothing about fire arms. Bump stocks are a joke. They decrease you’re accuracy & are someone’s garage invention that’s not practical. How about the 1.6 million crashes and 400K deaths caused by teens texting and driving. There’s a cause to get behind.
1320 2018-06-23 22:00:05 You might need a little education in markets. Who is China going to sell their treasuries to?  If you’re suggesting Trump is bad for our and the world’s economy, I definitely agree. That’ll take some time to play out. Dow is made up of 30 stocks and 1% is minimal.
1321 2018-06-23 21:59:57 President Obama & AG Eric Holder made significant progress in phasing out 4 profit prisons.  45 immediately overturned 1st month in office after generous campaign donations. Now big 3 public 4PP  have $$$$ gov contracts & stocks soaring up to 100%

Not “wages”

Meaning your including capital gains from stocks, stocks that only 50% of people happen to own
1323 2018-06-23 21:57:42 Don't own any of his books. Read them all since the library stocks them. I always check their discontinued books shelf. Can pick up these for 20c each
1324 2018-06-23 21:56:25 For me it's not about making money, further it is the way how the economy will change. Investing into stocks 2.0 to help the industry to grow and go beyond the limit.
1325 2018-06-23 21:56:20 It's sad that there are so many old politicians in Washington..who couldn't care less about us having a safer option with #OnePlant @Cannabis 
Because they are worried about their pHarma stocks loosing value. Smh

1328 2018-06-23 21:52:58 I enjoy looking at charts but I need to heed wisdom. I had two stocks yesterday that I felt great about. One was a slam and the other was wrong. Our work gets us paid, but it’s all price action regardless of work we do AH #TraderLife

1333 2018-06-23 21:46:50 Please ban bump stocks.
1334 2018-06-23 21:46:30 So is lower taxes and $ in peoples pocket, Stocks making $,  ISIS beaten back, lowest unemployment for blacks and Hispanics, Nkorea relations, trades turning our way. Libs gonna say Hate trump, real people look in their wallets!
1335 2018-06-23 21:43:42 China Fake news; NEW YORK (AP) — Oil prices and energy companies rallied Friday after OPEC said it will produce more oil, but not as much as investors feared. While trade tensions remained in the headlines, U.S. stocks finished slightly higher at the end of a bumpy week.
1336 2018-06-23 21:43:29 Yep, typical trumper, "I'm  retired at 55" (on disability), "I have so many winning stocks"(gun stocks maybe).  When what you really are is one of the angry, white, forgotten folk who trump preys on. PS: Real wealthy people don't find the need to talk about it

1342 2018-06-23 21:38:56 I also see the FANG stocks as the last to get hit because the lower advertising $$revenues and  new taxes for consumers are a coming soon..,,along with all the other reasons you mentioned= RECESSION
1343 2018-06-23 21:37:57 Ban the motherf@cking bump stocks already!

1351 2018-06-23 21:30:40 Take precautions.
I already sold all my stocks & now only day trade.
I made a lot of money the same way in 2008.
It's not whether I want it or not.
It's inevitable.
But if a recession will sink Trump, the sooner the better.
We always recover from recessions; we may not from Trump

1360 2018-06-23 21:26:04 I think this law went out the window when @realDonaldTrump started to attack amazon, the nfl and it’s players. His statements on businesses has had affect on stocks. It’s disgusting how corrupt this administration is and no one is there to put the checks in place

1363 2018-06-23 21:23:09 We should give a few more billion dollars to corporations so that they can reinvest in their own stocks. It’s worked out perfect for the middle class!

1370 2018-06-23 21:13:18 SHOGUN GROUP stocks rallying
1371 2018-06-23 21:12:19 No. I might draw the line at putting them in a cage ... but not jail, or the public stocks. And they can keep their healthcare - they'll need it after I get through with them for what they are doing to babies, infants, and children.
1372 2018-06-23 21:10:11 No, it's about showing that you are disgusted with her behavior.  Social censure.  Shunning, being put in the stocks, wearing a scarlet letter - all used in the U.S. in the past.  At least we're not tar and feathering anymore.
1373 2018-06-23 21:10:10 Followed everyone. Thank you.

1383 2018-06-23 20:55:03 Biggby (the local coffee chain) stocks Harney. I was such a fan of their Hot Cinnamon Spice that I started buying it by the tin... and that led down a rabbit hole of tea.

1386 2018-06-23 20:52:33 Tilting stocks to the highest market cap is very much a decisive bet that performs better/worse in different cycles. Cap weighting is no more immune to underperforming than any other factor.
1387 2018-06-23 20:52:22 Optimism is great, actually getting tax breaks would be even better. I mean, you do it for the rich who then buy stocks for the own company. Why not give that money to small businesses whose employees directly contribute their money back into the economy?
1388 2018-06-23 20:51:45 I thought free marketeers understood supply and demand. What happens when supply exceeds demand ?
Quotas were needed to address falling fish stocks. It was the UK government who lazily tied quotas to boats and greedy boat owners who saw the chance of a profit and sold the quotas.
1389 2018-06-23 20:51:43 My long term goal is to buy STOCKS. But you won't know it tho because people are used to cars and bling. I will buy them tho. Trust me I will.
1390 2018-06-23 20:50:22 It was most likely ulterior motives as you stated. They wanted to toss out Kazach and the delay of cannon lake was the final straw. They couldn't have told the truth since that would have caused stocks to go down. We shall see how the new leadership dpes, hopefully better than BK
1391 2018-06-23 20:49:55 LMAO...with what, monopoly money? Their stocks are too unstable and now they impose tariffs against US, it's financial suicide and I have a feeling more countries will make a deal with US to avoid tariffs and financial tightrope walking.

1410 2018-06-23 20:30:00 US stocks traded on a relatively downbeat note in the past week as trade tensions between the United States and its major #trade partners lingered, weighing on the market.

1425 2018-06-23 20:18:14 Must be why stocks are in a bull mkt... Sure, correction in EMs but not fatal as yet.  Crude in major bull mkt and commodities.
1426 2018-06-23 20:18:05 Technology and especially cloud stocks are exceptionally difficult to game. In a single quarter a new competitor could offer a better service or product and investors in the first company will not see it coming. Stock in first company becomes falling knife

1443 2018-06-23 20:03:04 Investors like high risk, high reward stocks.
1444 2018-06-23 20:02:42 I have a question: 

I would like to support solar energy in Alberta, but since I live in an apartment, buying panels for my balcony will not get me a rebate, which makes the price difficult. 

Perhaps I could invest in solar stocks. Which companies would you recommend for this?
1445 2018-06-23 20:02:02 Ban bump stocks and more. What about my right to being safe?
1446 2018-06-23 20:00:39 Got a raise.
Got more taxes back. 
Bought a house.
Bought a truck.
Made more money in my stocks for retirement.
1447 2018-06-23 20:00:20 EXACTLY!! Someone get's it... especially when these companies current valuations are MASSIVE... The pot stocks market could be in for a potential shit show... Some LP's might be squeezed out. Unless you have a solid facility with low cost of production... look the fuck out
1448 2018-06-23 19:57:09 I’m starting to look into investing into mutual funds and stocks- let me know if you have any insights and advice! 
1449 2018-06-23 19:56:18 Yes great point. The economy sucks. I trust you sold all your stocks post the election. Didn’t think so.
1450 2018-06-23 19:55:35 Who stocks this Greg ?

It’s come to our attention that many food stocks made in China has human parts in them.
Pls be warned these Chinese people are not humans at all & would do anything for money 
1452 2018-06-23 19:54:33 Some stocks did sink into the close.... Looked "manipulated" ... NTNX, AAPL,  for example.
1453 2018-06-23 19:51:57 Ban bump stocks!!!
1454 2018-06-23 19:50:33 Stock may be up but stocks frequently change because of emotion, but it's vapid and temporary state.

Where are the incarceration facilities that the #Left talks about?  The ones that they compare to Auschwitz and Treblinka?

When the wall goes up, prisons won't be necessary.
1455 2018-06-23 19:48:12 TWO MORE STOCKS ZAKI LETS FUCKING GO
1456 2018-06-23 19:45:20 His stocks have plummeted
1457 2018-06-23 19:44:11 I calculate it - formula is short interest/daily trading volume. It's only Bitifinex so you have to make the assumption other margin exchanges are seeing similar trends.  So higher days means will take longer to cover the total short position, it's used for stocks.
1458 2018-06-23 19:43:36 Yes. Tell us Nevadans what you are doing for gun control. We kinda had a thing here last year. Remember you are banning bump stocks. How’s that going?
1459 2018-06-23 19:42:11 @LONDONAIMCAP where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?

1462 2018-06-23 19:38:31 Might be a good time to buy some stocks in modelo 
1463 2018-06-23 19:38:11 honestly as an indian I can say that while I’m not someone who gets immensely offended by this stuff (probably given that im a highly americanized indians) there are definitely indians who do get offended and rightly so. for so long indians have been reduced to laughing stocks
1464 2018-06-23 19:37:34 Yup. Years ago i used to try to nail EVERYTHING. Then on those hot days when 20 Stocks would hit the scans i would freeze and nail zero. Or worse, id lose money on the shitty ones while completely missing the GIFTS. Fuck that. Tunnel vision is key
1465 2018-06-23 19:37:32 Wanna learn about stocks tho. Hihi. Nice meeting you! Lets be mutuals and fangirl/fanboy together. Haha
1466 2018-06-23 19:36:53 Time to look at weed stocks. It will be legal soon.

1469 2018-06-23 19:35:51 Alors déjà le stockage est pas le même ,ensuite les gd récupèrent des stocks ils ne se servent pas en direct contrairement à nous qui n’avons que des champagnes récement dégorgés ce qui change tout,et beaucoup de cuvée de gd sont pas les mêmes d ailleurs non plus
1470 2018-06-23 19:33:48 From today looking ahead, most of the stocks I'll be trading will be around or over $100 a share. One of the stocks I'm looking at for next week is $CHDN. Looks like with the volume it could break above that base it's been in.
1471 2018-06-23 19:33:22 Buy my dad his dream home , pay off my brother's mortgage , buy a house for my sister . Pay for my niece and nephew higher education then invest in bank stocks
1472 2018-06-23 19:32:11 I do the same thing trading penny stocks and have pulled 26500 into the bank account from a initial $2,000  etrade account still has 35 grand so made 60 grand in 18 months
1473 2018-06-23 19:30:26 It's harvest change over stocks will be low on most things only another few weeks and all the fresh stuff will be straight out of the field on to your plate (then the bin)
1474 2018-06-23 19:28:20 Là j’ai des stocks de smoothie jusqu’à le fin de ma vie
1475 2018-06-23 19:28:05 after yg went public for stocks he lost control of a lot of the company. like he has a say but the final decision is up to the investors. who probs don’t know shit about music. he also needs to hire new producers for diff sounds too. yg a whole mess tbh
1476 2018-06-23 19:27:59 Les fonds de stocks de chez levy @oHzeTv 
1477 2018-06-23 19:27:50 Its true! Fresh stocks tomorrow
1478 2018-06-23 19:25:44 I never defended Democrats, and never implied there isn’t corruption on both sides.

But currently, I’m concerned about things like the Sec’y of Education personally profiting from charter schools or the EPA chair’s retirement fund dependent on oil and coal stocks.
1479 2018-06-23 19:25:32 Wasnt it three times? Three casinos?

I didn't know about the stocks. Was this in casinos? The building of that gross building, trump Tower, is one of the biggest scandals I know of, until the trump regime was installed.
1480 2018-06-23 19:24:15 Hello guys, do you have a particular target in mind for the stock in the next 12 months ? I am holding 1000 stocks and planing to hold on for the long term.
1481 2018-06-23 19:24:08 I've gotten rekt on penny stocks but also made a shit ton on some as well. You can find a hustle in almost any industry that can have an exponential impact on your starting capital.
1482 2018-06-23 19:23:37 Cannabis stocks are at 30$ a share.. invest also went up 7$ at the end of the week. Took one fall by 30¢
1483 2018-06-23 19:19:28 I'm up 13% in my 401k and 37% in my Roth due to pot stocks......When you want to play with the big boys, let me know.
1484 2018-06-23 19:19:21 Most iOS apps are already in dark mode by default- clock, compass, calculator, stocks app  so I'm pretty sure most iOS users are ok with a dark mode
1485 2018-06-23 19:18:46 Will crush you with my stocks and bonds. if it's alone.
1486 2018-06-23 19:18:06 Ketchup on anything except meatloaf should land one in the stocks.
1487 2018-06-23 19:17:39 We're STILL in Iraq. STILL in Afghanistan. Still dropping #121BombsADay 40 million in poverty. Stocks are falling. 61% of Americans can't afford a $1K emergency. Refugees coming to America for a better life won't find it here! That's sadly the ultimate irony. =) xo RT #War #HBDC
1488 2018-06-23 19:15:57 Do we know what the most held stocks were in 2007/8?
1489 2018-06-23 19:15:36 Bought some stocks.  Boosted my share
1490 2018-06-23 19:14:59 Awww yey! Maymay cover  thank you po. Marami pa po silang stocks?
1491 2018-06-23 19:13:33 And the employees that screwed in that deal. Were made to buy stocks, then he dumped them so they not only didn't get paid but lost money too. I still say how the hell can you bankrupt a casino - many times?!
1492 2018-06-23 19:12:50 That’s 2 stocks. Not single
1493 2018-06-23 19:11:48 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1494 2018-06-23 19:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1495 2018-06-23 19:09:41 no panic here.... building the dirty fiat stack... Will unload on stocks/crypto when the opportunity is presented.

1499 2018-06-23 19:06:02 This Week’s News:

Trump locks up kids in a pen;
Sarah’s been tossed from the Red Hen.

Stocks tumble from Trump’s trade war;
While tax breaks help the rich & destroy the poor.

Kim’s still a threat with an arsenal of nukes;
White House still overrun with dotards, morons & kooks.
1500 2018-06-23 19:04:02 The beauty of self directed IRAs is that they allow investors to choose from an almost unlimited number of investments. An investor can choose to buy stocks and bonds, right alongside a vacant lot in Costa Rica and stock in a new startup business.
1501 2018-06-23 19:01:22 Does anyone know of anywhere in Dublin that stocks cotton handkerchiefs with initials on them?! Have found some on Etsy but would rather buy here if possible. #helpplease #supportinglocalbusiness
1502 2018-06-23 19:00:38 A self directed IRA is a type of IRA account that allows for investments in non-traditional assets like real estate, tax liens, private notes and so on. In addition to non-traditional investments, self directed IRA plans also allow for traditional investments like stocks or bonds
1503 2018-06-23 18:59:21 My boy said I need help I buy to many stocks
1504 2018-06-23 18:58:52 Just five stocks (Apple, ExxonMobil, Microsoft, GE and IBM) accounted for a tenth of all the wealth created for (US) shareholders between 1926 and 2016. - The Economist
1505 2018-06-23 18:54:57 Open to anyone... but realistically, investing in stocks is a game for the already well to do.
1506 2018-06-23 18:53:49 They shouldn't be allowed to buy stocks! Conflict of interest!
1507 2018-06-23 18:52:42 Here’s one even better. Band all the videos games with all the violence in them. You the games where you rap, rob, kill than blow up a school. So you get behind that than I’ll support you ban bump stocks.
1508 2018-06-23 18:51:33 PONDER THIS!

Nearly every member of Congress and Senate are multi millionaires.  They live in multi million dollar mansions on a salary of 174K a year.  Most own stocks in healthcare, and oil while passing healthcare and environmental laws?  Insider Trading??  That's a FELONY.
1509 2018-06-23 18:51:05 2018:
-The Eagles win a Super Bowl
-16-seed UMBC beats 1-seed Virginia
-An expansion team reaches the Stanley Cup finals
-#Germany is 45 minutes away from a group stage exit

People, sell your stocks. Kiss your loved ones. Knock some items off the bucket list. We're near the end.
1510 2018-06-23 18:50:54 Thats why I'm investing in Canadian Pot stocks
1511 2018-06-23 18:50:43 ban bump stocks..please
1512 2018-06-23 18:50:22 You'll be screwed when you retire.

1515 2018-06-23 18:49:09 TWN Stocks: First Steamship 益航 (2601) stock went from the $8's to the $14's.   Large shareholders and foreign investors, since May, have been selling with both hands and both feet and laughing all the way to the bank.  Retail investors get fucked in their asses.
1516 2018-06-23 18:49:05 I am for banning bump stocks & AR-15. But it won’t change a thing. Until parents at home stop grounding they’re kids and start whooping they’re asses again. It’s become a country of crybaby ass snowflakes, claim they’re trying to express themselves. Spare the rod spoil the child.

1519 2018-06-23 18:45:12 Difficulty to find quality stocks. There is so much hype all around that quality stocks are not easy to find maybe.
1520 2018-06-23 18:44:42 Pull your money out of banks, sell stocks! They need our deposits to function! Use cash only!
1521 2018-06-23 18:43:44 Which has been "under construction" since Feb!

Is that countdown still on there?
1522 2018-06-23 18:43:14 Agree with @YellowtailFP  A non-commoditised service is priced as such. Sometimes we even start our work based on indicative fees until we know what's what.
1523 2018-06-23 18:42:51 Follow all on both lists and we will follow back.  Then we will be united.
1524 2018-06-23 18:42:41 That's not how the law works. It was decided that bump stocks did not make a firearm automatic because you're still technically pulling the trigger for each shot. It's a loophole, but if you wanted to ban them or regulate them you'd need to close it. Which is pointless
1525 2018-06-23 18:41:25 ban bump stocks
1526 2018-06-23 18:41:19 Following All! Thank you! God bless the USA! 
1527 2018-06-23 18:40:36 Didn't Sessions mention Private Prisons? and the stocks bumped up after the election? Now we have prisons for children.

1542 2018-06-23 18:27:16 I heard @RedHenLex has rats
1543 2018-06-23 18:26:43 No good reason for bump stocks. Ban them.
1544 2018-06-23 18:26:42 Yes because when i mean punish i mean take their stocks, i rarely every kill with Uthrow thunder, most of it is me punishing their disadvantage state.   Uthrow is a very telegraphed option because once they're at that % they know you're going to want a grab.

1547 2018-06-23 18:23:47 OPEC is always able to sell their crude.  I'm sure they could sell >1mbd if they tried. But it won't all get refined or it's going to replace other supply. Total petrol stocks are going to rise. All 3 agencies roughly agree on +1.4-+1.6mbd growth.  It didn't just increase +1mbd.
1548 2018-06-23 18:23:06 I heard they have rats
1549 2018-06-23 18:22:46 As a 29 year member of the NRA, I'll float a compromise for discussion...we will give up our rights to bump stocks if you give up your rights to own a mobile phone since the # of people killed by drivers using phones is exponentially higher than by ANY gun.
1550 2018-06-23 18:22:04 @RedHenLex I heard you have rats.
1551 2018-06-23 18:19:28 Oh yes! The Cerebos works. The kids used to play on the bogeys. Plus the works let them have fresh water as well as access to any damaged food stocks.
1552 2018-06-23 18:19:23 Bump stocks provide no useful purpose. They just make the users feel more powerful. Actually it just exposes their weakness.
1553 2018-06-23 18:19:13 It’s not just tourists. We as a society consume an incredible amount of fish, far more than natural stocks can support. If we stop consuming the farmed product and eat only wild, we’ll be competing directly with the orca for what’s left.
1554 2018-06-23 18:18:57 Thank you for bringing us all together
1555 2018-06-23 18:18:50 NASDAQ doesn't lie. Sure, it may have gone down a bit that day or next, but so did other stocks. Point is, you haven't hurt them.
1556 2018-06-23 18:18:44 1bump stocks serve no purpose outside of killing humans,  they need to be banned... forever
1557 2018-06-23 18:16:29 For those family and friends looking into stocks. This is one to do your DD on “FSD PHARMA Inc” imo you won’t be disappointed.

1559 2018-06-23 18:15:34 I care because I am an "older" gamer (and own stocks) Now...if a 15 year old was talking stocks to make an argument, that would be a bit weird.

1561 2018-06-23 18:14:55 What we need is an alternative to the @nra. I have two guns, but I will never give those tools a dime of my money. We need an organization that respects the #2a, but prioritizes gun safety, and which advocates for reasonable restrictions on bump stocks and the like.
1562 2018-06-23 18:13:37 It the tax shift, was such a good thing, the GOP would not need to coordinate the Propoganda release attempting to give it a positive spin.

1574 2018-06-23 18:04:38 Ban bump stocks!!!!
1575 2018-06-23 18:04:32 Agree w this. I’ve covered this space for 20 years and the idea that there will be a smooth handoff from video to hsd is naive. Stocks cheap v ‘14 but certainly not relative to a longer view

1580 2018-06-23 17:59:29 No problem as soon as GOP repays federal deficit trillion it gave no strings attached to corporations with record profits & cash on hand to buy back stocks & help themselves.

I’ve maintained about 10% of my net worth in crypto, and will continued to add if it goes down. Disclosure: I have a high cash flow and would still be wealthy if my crypto was worth 0.

You have formed your young opinions based on a horrible tragedy & I empathize with you. However, if you want to REALLY make a difference in saving MANY more young lives, stop worrying about bump stocks & take up the cause of driving while using mobile phones.

1592 2018-06-23 17:48:59 Can't balance the budget without upping debt. These cuts won't dent it.  We're in a debt spiral + no plans to stop. The tax cuts we just had = inflation + devalued dollar.  We're going full banana oligarchy. Internationally, we are now untrusted laughing stocks. #pschopathgop

1602 2018-06-23 17:43:59 Investing in the Stock Market is NOT about maximizing your profits by betting large amounts of money in certain stocks. 

Remember, Stock Market equals Uncertainty, and to protect ourselves from it, we DIVERSIFY and RE-BALANCE our portfolios! 
1603 2018-06-23 17:43:19 using stocks =/= using presets, some people just drop presets on but when you use stocks you still gotta make it look good/original

1607 2018-06-23 17:40:35 That's actually just an observation of just how catastrophic for Britain's fishing Industry and British fish stocks, the EU's CFP is. Post Brexit British prosperity, id entirely down to how much effort is put into wealth creation, rather than the EU's Corporate Socialist

1629 2018-06-23 17:27:03 If your Stocks are in an ISA and/or SIPP why would you work out your Returns on a Tax Year (April 5th) basis? Doing it 31st December means more time to calculate and ponder where you can improve.
1630 2018-06-23 17:27:02 No one needs to kill our children faster. STOP the insanity of bump stocks!!!!!!!!!

I don't fib...my mother would be ashamed
1641 2018-06-23 17:20:19 does seem like a perfect storm of negativity towards the industry, and unexpected video losses will  punish these stocks as we've seen! thanks man.
1642 2018-06-23 17:19:42 Wrong.  Studies show that companies are buying back their stocks instead of investing in American jobs.  Keeping stock prices high is good for CEO bonuses.

Your tax cut goes away in a few years.

Gas prices very high, and soon, cuts to SS and Medicare.
1643 2018-06-23 17:19:37 Clearly it's a Grenade like object, likely from the  military stocks.  Inside hit ?

1648 2018-06-23 17:15:54 Because he’s been knowingly scamming his investors, which is why there’s currently a lawsuit concerning exactly that, with testimony from 11 insiders. I’m sure you knew that though. And stocks don’t float on air forever. That’s why analysts are asking him tough q’s on CCs now.
1649 2018-06-23 17:15:27 Ban bumps stocks NOW!

1661 2018-06-23 17:09:39 I do not trade Tesla stocks, but if you read Zerohedge article carefully you will understand that Elon is a rogue who is risking money of shareholders to defend his family bad management and investments in SolarCity and buying lossmaking enterprises for expense of shareholders.
1662 2018-06-23 17:09:37 Stock market is not doing well. Why is it that when market was doing well, it was evidence of your golden touch, but you say nothing about stocks falling? Clearly, it must be evidence that you are doing something very wrong to our economy.
1663 2018-06-23 17:08:25 Fact check: bump stocks were banned March 23, 2018. Next time you post something already stupid make sure it’s correct.

1666 2018-06-23 17:07:34 Trump you said you would ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase guns to 21. What have you not?
1667 2018-06-23 17:07:16 We CAN and should eliminate bump stocks!! They serve no useful, moral purpose.
1668 2018-06-23 17:07:14 Bump stocks should have been banned immediately after the Vegas mass shooting. There's no excuse for the inaction!
1669 2018-06-23 17:07:14 Ban bump stocks!!!

1671 2018-06-23 17:06:41 a laughing stock that was 1 win away from the finals in 2016? Come on. Teams like the Kings, Magic, and Knicks are laughing stocks. OKC has done pretty well for a small market team.
1672 2018-06-23 17:06:41 Is this how I get a list of stocks to short from Trump?

1676 2018-06-23 17:06:15 BAN BUMP STOCKS. No one needs these for hunting, for sport, or for personal protection. Bump stocks transform other weapons into vehicles for mass slaughter.

1678 2018-06-23 17:05:57 Uhhhh, surely I am not actually going in?? I’ve done the stocks AND the goal of horror. Surely I can just eat ice cream and watch you lot in action this year??

1680 2018-06-23 17:05:47 Ban bump stocks immediately.
1681 2018-06-23 17:05:24 That won't last for long once your misguided tariffs really take hold. When the economy tanks and the stocks crash it will be all on you.

1685 2018-06-23 17:05:08 Dear Sir,
     You have not completed any trade deals with the 76 countries we have deals with. The 19 months since election you talk great numbers this and that. In the last 19 months of Obama’s presidency more jobs(4.1 million) were created. Stocks in all three exchanges...
1686 2018-06-23 17:05:02 "Don't mind me asking Stocks, but...what's the reason you two aren't a thing no more, to be honest you two looked perfect together."
1687 2018-06-23 17:04:51 Listen to the kids! Ban bump stocks.

1692 2018-06-23 17:04:11 Bump stocks have no legitimate purpose, only assist in mayhem and murder
1693 2018-06-23 17:03:59 Think SP it's gonna do very well off the hype and excitement- I hope it will do well in reality but it is high risk imho most Chris Oil stocks I heard him tip in 2015 absolutely tanked and he then disappeared for a while #blcc
1694 2018-06-23 17:03:57 You don't need a bump stock to take down a deer. Ban bump stocks now!
1695 2018-06-23 17:03:42 The other issue is this diversification language gets at one of the core SEC issues. Because it has more than x stocks, despite weights, SEC allows them to market as a diversified. The exchanges of course could care less.

1712 2018-06-23 16:58:04 Are you sure about that
1713 2018-06-23 16:57:41 This idea was mentioned on @TalksMachina a long time ago but it seems like it should be a thing now!!!
1714 2018-06-23 16:54:53 Same with crypto and penny stocks :) then you can just chase Tournies! I enjoy the tournament format if its deepstack and over 30 min rounds otherwise I'm a hard pass on turbos

1721 2018-06-23 16:46:00 When other people say they broke it means they still got 5k in savings, 10k in stocks, and 3k in checkings they dont wanna touch. When i say im broke i got $0.64 to my name 
1722 2018-06-23 16:43:51 Institutional investors are trying to crash crypto before they short the stock market again, so they can ride a new wave.
Bigger picture, recession is due, economy as a whole is overbought and overpriced. Real estate, assets, stocks etc
While Crypto is oversold. Reversal soon 
1723 2018-06-23 16:43:45 Just filter out the people don’t deserve your teachings. Not everyone deserves the skills needed to make money in stocks. It’s so hard and people wonder why. If only they focused on the teachings more. My opinion
1724 2018-06-23 16:43:16 Naubusan ng regular pre-workout drink? You are an athlete and you should have enough stocks of what you used to take and not risk your game by taking a new supplement. #TBLKieferRavena

1726 2018-06-23 16:42:37 not all moves in stocks tell us about a recession. sometimes they simply get ahead of themselves and need corrections.

1731 2018-06-23 16:39:13 I would take 2.5 million and put in an interest bearing account; Invest 6 million in income producing properties.  Stop working,  as study stock investing and slowly invest 1.5 million in stocks.
1732 2018-06-23 16:38:15 Buying stocks is like buying vegetables: you want to buy the good ones at a reasonable price; you don't want to buy the bad ones cheap; and you avoid buying good ones at exorbitant prices.

1738 2018-06-23 16:30:34 If Scotland was out of the eu it would need to then sell its fish into the eu against whatever tarriffs that were put in place which might price our fish out of the market
This would surely be a worse scenario than managing the fish stocks along with the eu
1739 2018-06-23 16:29:16 Jaitley is unimaginative FM... First ongc takeover of HPCL... Markets have been at good levels... Why are they sitting on SUUTI stocks...ITC,  LnT,  Axis bank and many more. Point is don't get greedy and handover to strategic long term investor. BTW LTCG is a pathetic idea.

1742 2018-06-23 16:27:33 Not true.  U just have to do ur work and find them.   The market will catch up if ur in the right stocks.
1743 2018-06-23 16:27:24 Ummm wages are not going up, healthcare costs are going up, gas prices are going up, layoffs are still happening and corporate America is using its generous tax cuts to buy back stocks and make themselves richer. Now what part of that is not true?

1750 2018-06-23 16:16:05 How many people were killed in Parkland by a murderer with guns? 17. What have you done about that? How many people were killed in Las Vegas when one jerk with guns and bump stocks committed mass murder? What has the Admin done about that?
And separating kids still abusive.
1751 2018-06-23 16:15:43 Time to ban bump stocks
1752 2018-06-23 16:15:25 Also you can use a 3D printer to make bump stocks so there's no way to stop anyone from getting them! Plus he's not beholden to the NRA he's beholden to our constitution and our Bill of Rights!!

1762 2018-06-23 16:08:27 @carling we are struggling to find stocks in our supermarkets. I can understand that with the World Cup being on people may be buying more but we can’t find 20’s or 18 packs anywhere @AutyWarriorMum
1763 2018-06-23 16:07:10 This is for the @thejointstaff ,  Perhaps more incentive is needed to recruit really competent personnel like oil stocks with dividend reinvestment and in States that do not legalize marijuana ! Spoils that go to the victors is lacking herein closed the remedy !
1764 2018-06-23 16:07:02 Listening to conservative talk radio is a wonderful introduction to “buy gold” scams abetted by near-constant messages about how stocks are about to implode and the economy will soon nosedive. doomsday prepper scams are also abundant.
1765 2018-06-23 16:06:58 I’m agreeing that those that have 401ks are benefiting when stocks go up and will be hurt if market goes down drastically due to tariffs.  Would never wish for anyone to get hurt financially.

Tell me @OnePlus_IN why do you like to bite more than you can chew and leave us hanging?
1769 2018-06-23 16:03:06 i didn’t either so i just started researching everything and started slow. most investment things let you buy partial stocks as well so you don’t actually have to invest thousands at first

1785 2018-06-23 15:44:00 You say the same thing about every candidate and 10 to 1 you know nothing about them.  You are the biggest bullshit liar. Lamb the sham, really.  The blue wave is coming especially when the chief is a constant liar. What about the kids. Bump stocks,  mass murders, Puerto Rico

1793 2018-06-23 15:35:48 Correct. You know SOME of the costs involved.  The assessment mentions the need for at least 1 billion Euro buffer stocks; and, potentially, another 1 billion Euro in weekly losses. But also there are serious regulatory issues to add to costs.
1794 2018-06-23 15:35:16 Until US tech can operate in China, Chinese stocks are going to continue to eat up market share. Long run way for them. US companies are getting smart tho and partnering with their Chinese counterparts. Getting in on the action that way.

1796 2018-06-23 15:34:58 It def is - I would not have bet that the Dow would have gone as low as 6,000 and change. I thought maybe 8,000-9,000 would have been the low about a decade ago. I also didn’t think we’d get this high now before stocks slid back
1797 2018-06-23 15:34:04 Do you actually have stocks? Go look at them, it ain’t pretty.
1798 2018-06-23 15:33:50 The majority of managers have no idea what they own or how to value it. they buy stocks in vogue often indexing....Often times the emperor has no clothes and short sellers profit off that and they should

1801 2018-06-23 15:31:31 That is exactly what I am talking about! 401Ks are investments in Mutual Funds and STOCKS. When the Stock Market drops, people’s 401K values drop.
1802 2018-06-23 15:31:09 No actually companies are buying stocks back, rewarding managers, and lower employee wages are staying the same.
1803 2018-06-23 15:30:27 I am hanging out at my Mom in law’s this weekend and it is so peaceful and cozy here. It’s the perfect place to read!! Also she stocks my favorite chocolates when I come. #spoiled

1806 2018-06-23 15:27:40 Any working person who has a 401K owns stocks & Mutual Funds! Even McDonalds has 401K for their employees. Yep, burger flippers benefit from increased Stock pricing!
1807 2018-06-23 15:26:37 I agree with @KurtSchlichter - these leftists are spoiling for a civil war.

1815 2018-06-23 15:16:41 If my taxes had been cut in half I would have a positive outlook too. It's too bad that all they seem to want to do with that money is give a one time symbolic bonus and use the rest to buy back stocks to artificially inflate their stock prices so the executives make more money

1820 2018-06-23 15:09:36 The whole point is to take our tax dollars and enrich "contractors" by holding hostages.

The more they misuse our tax $, the better off their offshore bank accounts are

Remember when trump was selected, prison stocks jumped up. 

Planned it all ahead of time.
1821 2018-06-23 15:09:26 I think we are in a crappy position with more then 1 player. There is a few players that need to come back strong so if and when they get traded we get some good offers. I think JD’s , Tulo and Osuna’s stocks have dropped.

1831 2018-06-23 14:59:57 The big tax giveaway to corporations is resulting in layoffs and flat wages. Meanwhile corporations are buying back stocks and our national deficit has ballooned to over $1 trillion. The GOP and Trump played a great game of three card Monty.
1832 2018-06-23 14:59:20 i don't post about this a lot of Canada just nationally legalized marijuana. If u don't open an Ameritrade account (free) and invest in marijuana stocks you're literally turning away free money. A lot of it.
1833 2018-06-23 14:58:46 Sounds bullish for stocks when nobody thinks VIX can go lower
1834 2018-06-23 14:58:26 While the man himself picks up stocks which have made him a high net worth individual, he has absolutely no qualms pushing a penny stock on others.
1835 2018-06-23 14:58:00 Stocks overvaluation is real with direct correlation to low interest rates and corporate buybacks and foreign ownership its illogical to expect future growth without real investment

1842 2018-06-23 14:54:26 When you trade stocks in Canada, these trades are reported to CRA so they already have access to this.  If they didn’t, a lot of people wouldn’t declare capital gains.  I am ok with that.

1848 2018-06-23 14:47:11 Depends on what you are trading. If you are trading commodities / forex / stocks & certain crypto you can SHORT them. If you have a long position in bitcoin at 11,000 & downtrend starts, you can close it at small loss & wait to reenter at better price
1849 2018-06-23 14:46:51 While naysayers point to relatively cheap P/E, they’re really missing the white elephant: most stocks aren’t being bot or worse are being sold. There is no governor in place to buffer the reverse of that move.

1869 2018-06-23 14:33:01 See this every day on many many stocks. I think the option expiration comment makes sense. I always thought it could be due to a ton of “at market close” orders going through for the ticker right at the bell. I assume those shares are mostly from funds
1870 2018-06-23 14:32:25 I would buy a handicap accessible van. Beyond that I would safely invest half for retirement and then invest the other in higher risk/reward stocks.
1871 2018-06-23 14:30:26 I just wait for stocks get thrown away. I slowly pick up what i like.
1872 2018-06-23 14:30:17 LOL. Enjoy the exercise. You may find you have a store nearby that stocks some of them. My sister used to live in Seattle and she could get some items there
1873 2018-06-23 14:29:21 @SHOWtibzLOVE

 Is there any place in Pretoria that stocks @AtelierMcc
1874 2018-06-23 14:27:43 @ETNOWlive last Friday's "Weekend BNSN" was excellent...smart anchoring...clear and unambiguous suggestions/advice by the two experts both 'fundamental' and 'technical'...personally I was also benefitted as some of the stocks discussed figure in my portfolio @avannedubash
1875 2018-06-23 14:27:30 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the legal age to purchase guns and where exactly are the remains?
1876 2018-06-23 14:26:05 Any chance you can talk about a past example of a sympathy period, and then the stocks that followed with offerings and how those played out? Would help give some context to this tweet and help others know what to look for in the future as it plays out
1877 2018-06-23 14:25:38 Give it time. You're too quick to jump on something easy. Stocks are down for the year.... You took credit for that. #Clownshoes

1890 2018-06-23 14:17:43 Hey you  idiot's. If tariffs are so bad why do all the countries we trade with put tariffs on our goods? By letting them do this it has already cost us millions of jobs and money. You might want to check but the people telling you this shit probably own stocks in foreign country

1897 2018-06-23 14:08:23 Splitting a total market between growth and value / large and small without leaving anything out would fall under passive. Slicing a market into industries without leaving anything out would also fall under passive. Counting only stocks on one exchange is an active theme, IMO.
1898 2018-06-23 14:08:14 @realDonaldTrump why is Raytheon stock taking a hit? All the defense stocks are taking hits right now? Shouldn't Defense stocks be higher?

1900 2018-06-23 14:01:23 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1903 2018-06-23 14:00:30 Where are the families of American students killed by American mass shooters? I really doubt any of the immigrant children you abused were packing automatic weapons or bump stocks.
1904 2018-06-23 13:59:24 say goodbye to $GE. So $WAG replaces an icon and we are suppose to view the Dow a viable index? Not mention it's a price weighted index of mostly old sluggish stocks. I'd rather use $FDX as an index as indicator of economic health the index was initially intended for.
1905 2018-06-23 13:58:58 damn i didn’t know Robinhood had the day trade option. that’s who i have my stocks with because they don’t charge fees when you buy or sell
1906 2018-06-23 13:58:36 What do you think a board of ditectors is? A group of workers making decisions. The only difference is a board of directors has more experience making decisions for a large company. People only invest (buy stocks) if they feel the company will do good.
1907 2018-06-23 13:58:35 Indices had week of rest, consolidation but stocks can have greater damage. ESU8 needs to hold 2732. NQU8 needs to hold 7160. If only consolidation then focus on opportunities. End of quarter and earnings season coming up. Markets tend to pay for doing the hard thing.
1908 2018-06-23 13:58:07 Best of luck. If you can guarantee me immunity from prosecution I will wear a badge. 
Then you will need to allow public floggings on each station. And stocks, with lots of rotten veggies.

1914 2018-06-23 13:55:28 The 1% love recessions because they can buy back everything very cheaply (stocks, properties, companies, etc).  

They have more than enough to easily survive the downturn.  When recovery happens (which it always does), they come out bigly ahead.

1918 2018-06-23 13:52:01 Your are right in your view, no second guessing, what i am trying to say is that in the long term it's % gain which is more imp in helping the account size grow.
As to manipulating part, it's difficult in high vol stocks & even if one could then may be a few rupees here & there.

1920 2018-06-23 13:51:08 Roughly same across indices ~ 65%. Unlike 2000, I don't see current glamour tech stocks (at least as a group) as being more or less vulnerable than the overall market, tho I do think investors should remember that rev growth slows dramatically as mkt share & size saturate.
1921 2018-06-23 13:50:46 well, actually now that I think of it Changmin oppa might have some of his money invested on SM stocks, and Jisoo unni will still be actively promoting after this... will they be able to afford it? only God knows... and probably a piece of their sanity left intact.

1936 2018-06-23 13:35:15 Of course they are. You gave them a huge tax cut that they bought stocks back with, and can have more profits to squirrel away. Doesn’t do anything for the people that work for them though.

1943 2018-06-23 13:29:09 1 stock trade = $4.95 in fees. 30 stocks = 30 trades = $150 in fees for the initial order. $150 in fees when you need to rebalance. Motif Investing charges $10 to buy all 30 stocks, and I think $10 to rebalance. It is 93% cheaper

1946 2018-06-23 13:24:29 Indexes are ok, cause if you make lets say 50/80 rupees on an Intra day trade in Nifty it sounds decent but not in terms of %. Some stocks in terms of % give double digit returns in a short span, so it is the % gain which helps you grow your trading account in the long run.

Tell that to the piles of ammunition, spare parts, NATO reserve fuel stocks, satellite intelligence and many many other things the DoD threw at us in 1982.

An LHA was offered too, we turned it down.
1971 2018-06-23 12:57:31 Why ban bump stocks? A rubber band can produce the same result as a bump stock. Try it on an ar15 it is quite fun shooting.

1977 2018-06-23 12:52:20 Bump stocks turn an AR into an automatic weapon. Automatic weapons are illegal in the US. And yes I I know it’s not truly automatic but it allows the shooter to fire 2-3 times more rounds per minute.  You want a bump stock then a background check  and license is needed.
1978 2018-06-23 12:49:43 Ah yes, NAM. That's not a skewed poll of 568 people whom received your tax break to buy back stocks and give board bonuses. All while screwing the workers (no trickle down). And NAM is known for fighting Unions from forming to keep workers rights suppressed. F'n the little guy...
1979 2018-06-23 12:45:18 True - less dd, but location consideration etc is all still there. In general, Ppl chalk up stocks as being risky yet have never apply the same amount of work into knowing what they’re buying. Stocks are treated like lottery tickets

1990 2018-06-23 12:33:29 I meant that stocks could fail following *current* earnings. With reduced earnings, they may stay at current levels, or even slide, if current levels reflect higher expectations.
1991 2018-06-23 12:33:08 Yup every one says invest in quality stocks but no one names few to invest
1992 2018-06-23 12:32:11 People are more concerned with 2% daily returns (which is risky as hell) than getting a return of 20% annually in safe stocks.
I think a session every year on power of compounding should be made compulsory by government for everyone.
1993 2018-06-23 12:31:25 Who did it? and  If we are supposed to have "halts" why do we still see stocks drop 50% all the time with no halts?  Nothing has changed, there should be no derivatives at all, no options, no futures, cds, none of it, Fed is prob too, boom and bust, folks should invest again LT
1994 2018-06-23 12:31:06 FTR, I want to see Farage publicly shamed and humiliated. Ideally stocks and a dump-truck full of rotten fruit and eggs should be involved.
1995 2018-06-23 12:30:58 Difficult to find quality stocks
1996 2018-06-23 12:30:38 I’m a tsla shareholder. Occasionally I run some options in favorable circumstances for other stocks (clearly overbought or oversold scenarios). Nothing too tricky because I work FT for my income so I’m not watching with my finger on the button.
1997 2018-06-23 12:30:14 Hence I repeat again. No such thing as Valuation. Beauty is in eye of beholder. 
I never sell and buy only really nice stocks.
1998 2018-06-23 12:28:08 Oh, I’m talking about real stocks
1999 2018-06-23 12:26:27 For Sale!

2000 2018-06-23 12:25:40 Yes. It’s getting out performed by stocks like Twitter Netflix amazon.
2001 2018-06-23 12:25:14 Even beyond that, REITs, stocks, p2p lending, bonds as well with ur subscription. Love life n hustle. Peace 
2002 2018-06-23 12:22:33 They are looking only at the DJIA and think that just because the larger corps are over valuing their own stocks, by buying it back and pocketing the profits, the economy is 'good'. It's not, and it's about the crash IMO (unfortunately)
2003 2018-06-23 12:21:55 Stocks dey perform well
2004 2018-06-23 12:21:29 aku tweet jew. asal cari makanan kat aku. new place new stocks lah
2005 2018-06-23 12:20:19 Yes @RobinhoodApp is amazing. @coinbase better watch out. Crypto & Stocks in one app, lower fees and more coins and states being added all the time.
2006 2018-06-23 12:19:35 Can we depend on 2 stocks and take risk with money..any stock can become Satyam..diversification is important it feel
2007 2018-06-23 12:15:19 always good posts & make me think. thx! i don't like shorting individual stocks, puts yes, 3x ETFs yes...but no short stocks. i agree many stocks look ripe for a p/b or rest. trying to keep an open mind here.
2008 2018-06-23 12:15:12 Soooi, I just bought a £250 backpack for only 30 quid! 

This is one of the times I am happy that I live in a country obsessed with seasons changing and new stocks 
2009 2018-06-23 12:14:02 Just tell them playing stocks is funny like comedy! lol
2010 2018-06-23 12:13:56 So did you already buy stocks in the company that would build it? I am a native of Orlando, How about building more FREEWAYS? I remember when the 408 went up in the 70’s, it was promised once the tolls paid for it that they would come down!! Yet all that has been built is tolls
2011 2018-06-23 12:13:09 Amazon doesn't make a profit most of the time so good luck making them care. Their value comes from stocks.
2012 2018-06-23 12:09:29 I don't think they care. Look into their sales figures and you will see that they barely make a profit. Their value comes from stocks
2013 2018-06-23 12:07:32 Went on a quiet date night with Stocks to a tapas restaurant and now we’re two bottles of red wine deep with a Latin American band playing in the background whilst we are chatting absolute shite and this is why I love this gal with my whole heart
2014 2018-06-23 12:05:42 Doesn't he have certain positions simply to bet on commodity prices?  Physical silver, railroad stocks, Cliffs Natural Resources, etc.
2015 2018-06-23 12:04:35 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.(No.131) #Duo30L11
2016 2018-06-23 12:03:11 This channel doesn’t normally carry adverts but FYI the animatronic unicorn in Birmingham Selfridges that was £3690 can now be purchased for a mere £490 - presumably that’s ‘while stocks last’.
2017 2018-06-23 12:02:25 Hell yeah!
2018 2018-06-23 12:00:52 Well the worship moloch
2019 2018-06-23 11:58:19 Common knowledge that stocks and poker edge is all down to odds, 
The difference between pros and amatuers is the emotional control. 
Control these urges and you will succeed. #tilt
2020 2018-06-23 11:57:31 Stocks can give you the opportunity to do whatever you want.  Real Estate gives you a place to do it.
2021 2018-06-23 11:57:26 sigurong stocks dahil may ly tear na. ayoko na maglitanya pa, di nyo rin naman pinapansin. yun lang hehe. gigil na naman ako.
2022 2018-06-23 11:57:08 @realDonaldTrump Look at Raytheon and Lockheed Martin stocks, They have been sold to oblivion! Its time for these stocks and companies to move up!
2023 2018-06-23 11:56:23 Don’t care about MSM fake outrage
2024 2018-06-23 11:56:20 forget the witch hunt! What is happening to Raytheon Stock! LockHeed Martin Stock! America's defense is strong, those stocks should be way up!!! What happened?
2025 2018-06-23 11:53:40 Story time
My mother inherited 2.5 million in 1983 from her aunt
Mostly in stocks I think
1990 ALL was gone
Could've lived comfortably off dividends 
Instead many bad investments
Over few year period
Reason why GREED is a mortal sin
Having everything
Then literally nothing.......
2026 2018-06-23 11:53:15 @PeteHegseth 
I believe in mandatory annual audits of big city public employee pension funds. The irony is the Trump Administration economic policies have probably rescued many of these funds as stocks in 401Ks have seen huge gains under @realDonaldTrump
2027 2018-06-23 11:52:37 oh my!!! bloody days ahead both crypto and stocks

2029 2018-06-23 11:49:34 Buy the cheapest stocks I can find with good fundamentals, live like I’m broke for 5-10 years. Invest a little in real estate and start up projects. See what my portfolio looks like in a few years.
2030 2018-06-23 11:47:09 But why not use log utility here? If EUT is true, your UF should not change, right? Why adopt linear utility in this game, when players would never do so in eg stocks? Is it perhaps because the poker dynamics are additive somehow? Eg fixed initial bet per hand, can’t apply Kelly?
2031 2018-06-23 11:47:03 One potential downside to in small cap stocks is the lack of liquidity as compared to big cap peers. #Downside #Small
2032 2018-06-23 11:45:59 Okay need a few stocks to pop this week so I can book this dessert hotel
2033 2018-06-23 11:44:53 So you really think that the VIX futures can move the massively bigger SP 500.. the 500 biggest stocks in the US?
Give me a break. The tail is (normally) not wagging the dog. It can have an Impact on special occasions (like Feb 5) but that massive position is squeezed out.
2034 2018-06-23 11:44:14 I agree, I am starting to think crypto is 100% b.s. Stocks & commodities have market forces that are predictable, So called crypto expert analysis has been as accurate as astrology. Once the masses lose confidence then it will be worth little to nothing..Again.

2041 2018-06-23 11:30:58 INDEX FUNDS focused on U.S. stocks—both the mutual-fund and the exchange-traded varieties—attracted $1.6 trillion in new money over the past decade, while actively managed funds saw $1.3 trillion in redemptions, says the Investment Company Institute.
2042 2018-06-23 11:29:14 so correct...wall street is doing well but who can afford stocks
2043 2018-06-23 11:28:56 I thought u meant the comments were made up. Yeah aulas is playing a game, now hes backtracking. Its all to do with stocks etc
2044 2018-06-23 11:27:47 Selective bias at the extreme...the USD by design loses its value with monetary expansion. That is why people with excess dollars by property, hold stocks and invest in bonds to offset it. The USD therefore is not an investment instrument. BTC however is a falling knife right now
2045 2018-06-23 11:23:53 Is this all some kind of scam, one carnt argue that everything sounds rosy under Donald Trumps watch. Since his first day in the office, we have seen a steady uphill rise in the global markets. Stocks and shares prices at all time record. What's really happening on the ground?
2046 2018-06-23 11:23:19 Invest in real estate, stocks, start a business, open apartments etc

2057 2018-06-23 11:07:59 I’d say you’re a clever man! Also picked up a bunch more. It’s like the Ollie’s Bargain Basement of stocks right now, just without the dodgy signs!
2058 2018-06-23 11:07:05 Same experts ... Same dialogue...

2059 2018-06-23 11:05:20 same here with my friend, new stocks arrive in July…
2060 2018-06-23 11:01:58 How are the stocks of tomatoes and eggs coming along? May may have to welcome Trump in her favourite cowshed, to avoid the embarrassment of opposition!!
2061 2018-06-23 10:59:24 'Focus List'
A focus list is a list of recommended stocks published by an investment firm's research department. Focus lists generally consist of a small number of stocks that the firm believes are the most attractive opportunities at the time.
2062 2018-06-23 10:58:02 Mdr mais tu pige pas toi.  Il n'y a plus de stocks. C'est sold out
2063 2018-06-23 10:57:59 The stocks themselves - I think they end up being a loose proxy for Western sentiment re: the Chinese consumer. 

Their penchant for equity investments might create or destroy value. Hard to say. But perception of BATJ’s capital allocation will fluctuate w/ perception of BATJ.
2064 2018-06-23 10:54:32 Ctrl alt delete it all Brenda I told you THE STOCKS TELL ALL
2065 2018-06-23 10:54:32 Stv mec juste je m'en blc qu'il soit natty ou pas franchement juste ça m'énerve que tôt le monde mettent de le même sac les gens "stocks" on va dire en disant qu'ils sont dopés en général alor que nan c'est une minorité qui ternis l'image du sport rien de plus
2066 2018-06-23 10:51:44 That's concentrated investing in a few stocks, which the majority don't practice. Even mutual funds.

2069 2018-06-23 10:43:43 Hi, 2 quick query
From where do you get the historical IV data of stocks to calculate IV Rank?

And for nifty and BN you take India VIX as reference?
2070 2018-06-23 10:42:43 An Investor may have to read the book "Common Stocks and Uncommon profits" before calling "You got Lucky"! Intelligent Investors do look for Qualitative parameters before Investing. Warren Buffet / Philip Fisher are not Great Investors by Luck!!! @SwarnashishC
2071 2018-06-23 10:39:04 Friend who invested into mid and small cap stocks over the last 2 years has had his profits from last year + almost 35% wiped out. 

He's terribly upset. Phew
2072 2018-06-23 10:37:37 But Graham picked up cheap stocks. Spinoza also said 
"Fear cannot be without hope and hope without fear."
You have to have fear to have hope of success. Investing in less risky better managed ventures reduces the fear. Graham's formula applies to just undervalued stocks.

2094 2018-06-23 10:10:07 The alternative for Fang stocks in India  is the Sin stocks.

2124 2018-06-23 08:59:44 Fascinating, we’re back in 2014!
Fact is, there are a lot of companies and individuals who want to bankrupt Tesla. The Tesla stocks are the most shorted one in the USA.
2125 2018-06-23 08:59:09 Certainly Papier as the stocks have been low in recent times and we can't have too many scrummies. Keen to see his pace. The midfield is exciting as the one weak player from the last 2 games was De Allende (zero vision). I've yet to see Chiliboy make an impact so maybe this week?
2126 2018-06-23 08:54:42 Stocks account up a little bit..need to take that a bit more serious..really get on this trading thing
2127 2018-06-23 08:53:02 Am surprised at your foolish comparison. Seriously, is this how you pick your stocks ???
2128 2018-06-23 08:51:42 Of a trade war reduces earnings, stocks still follow those reduced earnings lower. Up or down, stocks only follow earnings over time.

In times of robust stock markets n mutual fund options LIC promoting endowment policy itself is wrong. But if it does it has no choice but to invest in stocks

2157 2018-06-23 08:03:28 S&P and MSCI will reclassify stocks in several sectors at the end of Sep., : Vanguard already began tracking new transition benchmarks in May to reflect the eventual change where many consumer discretionary and tech stocks will be joining a brand new "communications services".
2158 2018-06-23 08:03:06 The gold miners’ stocks are drifting listlessly in the summer doldrums, largely forgotten by investors and speculators.  They are missing a fantastic opportunity to buy low in this barren sentiment wasteland when no one else wants to.  The gold stocks remain exceedingly cheap.

2168 2018-06-23 07:47:08 I’ve discovered the hard way that anything branded Avanti is to be avoided. There should be a law to flog any shop owner that stocks them.
2169 2018-06-23 07:46:10 Stocks will crash
2170 2018-06-23 07:42:35 Also, just letting you know it says we won’t get the coverfx drops until we get our July box (as long as stocks last) so that’ll be next month :)
2171 2018-06-23 07:39:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
2172 2018-06-23 07:39:00 Hahaha ahahahaha yes the new grady white sport fisher i just bought reflects the stock market very well.. No way could id have been able to buy it under obama. Got it with just part of what my stocks got me this year.. Keep it up ya halfwit. Lmao
2173 2018-06-23 07:38:57 I wonder what % of wealth people have in cash anyway. Most that have money to invest would presumably do so in assets such as stocks bonds and property. I think bitoiners overestimate the demand for a crypto sov

2182 2018-06-23 07:26:01 CONCLUSION: A pullback in small/mid cap growth names is constructive at this point and not a bearish sign. If this pullback is shortlived or if there is more to come depends on the resilence of the big stocks! $INTC $NVDA $AAPL already started a pullback. Get defensive!
2183 2018-06-23 07:24:15 For the last 4 years of this govt tenure LIC has been the one buying majority stocks of the divestment cycle of major PSUs yet posting increasing profit year after year..How??
2184 2018-06-23 07:23:40 If a stock have all the proper characteristics of a pattern but NO news (so it is one of the "NO NEWS BREAKOUTS" that we've seen rise also), should I trade it? If not, aren't manipulated stocks supposed to be the central point of this penny stocks strategies?
2185 2018-06-23 07:23:27 Young black men. Take those stacks. Buy some stocks. You love Jordans. Buy stock. You love Patron. But some stock. You love Swishers. Buy some stock. Get paid. Not played.
2186 2018-06-23 07:22:28 SUMMARY: We are in a broad rally which saw almost all small-mid cap growth and speculative names advancing. A pullback allows us to filter the strong from the weak names now. At the same time the Big stocks $AMZN $FB $GOOGL etc. grind higher without much conviction.
2187 2018-06-23 07:21:54 I didnt even notice that 3 hrs already passed while packing/checking orders/checking stocks. Lmaooo its rly a good thing I always have an extra day 
2188 2018-06-23 07:19:27 The word Fuck comes from colonial times when put in the stocks a crime would be written on a board hanging around the person’s neck. For unlawful carnal knowledge was to long.

2193 2018-06-23 07:08:43 @PMOIndia @narendramodi These banks create so many troubles for genuine borrowers & how come they issue huge loans to fraud promoters so easily?If banks /auditors would hv taken action earlier,small shareholders would hv been saved 2/2

2246 2018-06-23 05:44:30 Some stocks were plunging so fast they were giving super funky prints like down +20%.  Ruined a bunch of people with their stops and before they knew it the price had rebounded way past where they were stopped out.  But I knew a few people who lucked out w/low buy limit orders

Selling car vl only giv us half of our buying price.
So, da stocks must also be brought vth same perception.

2257 2018-06-23 05:28:44 Hi, I have started to be calm following the same strategy i told you before and luckily I am in process of recovery my lost money in dhampur. Now 1.9lakh pending to breakeven. I have started to treat trading like a number or mind game thereby detecting emotions. Shorting stocks.
2258 2018-06-23 05:28:41 Not true NRA told Obama that bump stocks needed another look 2 times ATF never checked it.Obama signed Bump stocks that into law And you have to pass a check done it myself. Not a 5 min. thing.Also CCP took me a week to get back.Assault Weapons Ban already in place 1994..

2260 2018-06-23 05:23:11 #BanBumpStocks well really we should ban more than Bump stocks but it’s a start.
2261 2018-06-23 05:22:14 @MoviePass @MoviePass_CS IF YOU ALLOWED SUBSCRIBERS THE ABILITY TO SEE THE SAME MOVIE UP TO 3x per month BUT, STILL FOLLOWING THE 1 MOVIE VIEWING/DAY RULE, YOUR STOCKS AND SUBSCRIPTION NUMBERS WOULD BE THROUGH THE ROOF!!!
2262 2018-06-23 05:19:30 Fine. Ban bump stocks.

2264 2018-06-23 05:15:48 I have getting diverted here, my concern is why don't those operating on this highly profitable routes reinvest in their rolling stocks or do we as a people just lack the ability to grow a business?
2265 2018-06-23 05:15:05 @BrandFactoryIND u make fool of customers, Sell stocks at 40% discount on MRP ( price Including of all taxes ) and then again charge 5% additional GST on that this cheating both customers and Govt .( GST Already charged once in MRP ) , going to consumer forum for their cheating

2267 2018-06-23 05:10:03 Russell 1000 is composed of the top 1000 largest stocks which include MSFT, FB and BA, among others. They are affected because the indexers (ETF, funds, etc.) who track the Russell 1000 will have to properly allocate their sizes based on the Russell 1000's revised weighting.

You have two cow &  
You sell 1 and buy a bull.
– Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
– You sell them and retire on the income
but here "Both cow are mad" .. seems bull & beer are playing Hide & Seek. Tough to trade in Indices compare to stocks.

2273 2018-06-23 05:00:56 Stocks follow earnings, until they don't. Trade war and newer unexpected headwinds may hit earnings before stocks catch up with them (just a scenario).

2282 2018-06-23 04:45:49 No, my stocks are up and it is in the best interest of just me, not every one else. It is the result of working hard, save money and invest in stocks when they were low in the last administration.
2283 2018-06-23 04:43:53 Do you happen to know if stocks are still high? I don't get paid til Monday
2284 2018-06-23 04:43:16 First time I'm seeing it, cool. Historically that is a very big sign of a bubble when only a few stocks are left going up. Jim Rogers says this all the time, I think you were just a few years to early buddy

2288 2018-06-23 04:39:55 So why would stocks like MSFT, FB, BA etc be affected... they're not Russell 2000 or 1000 names.   Nasdaq and NYSE names saw same phenomenon as well ... very strange to say the least... 

I've seen this before(many times) but always fascinating to see it happen!

2296 2018-06-23 04:21:05 that fight was serious. nothing to hang your head at. 
2297 2018-06-23 04:20:25 Yes.  Dump the stocks or pay the consequences.
2298 2018-06-23 04:18:09 I would pay off my debts, fix up my house, set up trust funds, give my friend something who helped me over the years and asked for nothing in return, give to my church, invest in stocks, downsize my life and invest in my community...not necessarily in that order. Lol
2299 2018-06-23 04:18:04 Not really. In fact the body language was very telling throughout. Mr NRA got all crossed arms & legs when the questions got tough. Also, anyone who  neglects to acknowledge that AR’s can shoot multiple calibers while using high capacity clips and bump stocks loses that argument.

2304 2018-06-23 04:15:43 Also, I don't have a desire to trade stocks based on nonpublic information. The recent 8K filings state the reports that should not be relied upon. There is no need to be redundant here. I would not disclose nonpublic/protected info to people unless there is a need to know.

2311 2018-06-23 04:08:52 Thats a headache. Im not really materialistic so maybe invest in something that could give steady income and buy a house and land just to live comfortably. The rest? Im not into stocks, i easily get anxious, so maybe just put in the bank and just live a simple life.

2317 2018-06-23 04:00:57 There is a bearish chart which shows stocks as a percentage of financial assets is the highest since the tech bubble. However, this masks the switch from non corporate investments to equity and mutual fund holdings which is likely a secular change. via /r/StockMarket …
2318 2018-06-23 03:58:53 So I don’t know exact percentages, that’s too scientific for me. I eat a heavy meat diet, with stocks & a nose to tail philosophy, like @WestonAPrice advises,nutrient rich. Very few carbs, cook our own food most of the time, very little fruit or sugars, coffee!

2326 2018-06-23 03:52:58 Betting on rerating when the stocks are actually preparing for derating. 

The most common investment blunder. Tge margin of error widens so much that it will take years to fill.

2328 2018-06-23 03:46:23 What I do agree with, is that it won't push money into Crypto. There is a very close correlation between stocks and crypto.
2329 2018-06-23 03:45:42 Yep, I have 3 kids, my wife and I both work full time. We both have 401ks sure, but that doesnt help now. We dont have money to invest in stocks. Trump has done nothing to help normal people. Its all smoke and mirrors. This tax "break" isnt even permanent like it is for the rich.
2330 2018-06-23 03:45:33 Ban all bump stocks!
2331 2018-06-23 03:45:30 Yeah, I might've jumped the gun yesterday :/  but hey, some stocks just don't workout (ever) for traders. I definitely have zero luck with industrials, utilities, and gold.

2338 2018-06-23 03:38:22 so who do you use to short penny stocks ?
2339 2018-06-23 03:37:57 There Is always a reason why stocks hit 52/wk highs even when the majority of the market is 40% to 50% below the peak. Past empirical evidence shows that these stocks lead the next wave of the up-move.
2340 2018-06-23 03:35:36 The fact Caballero is in goal tells you stocks are low.
2341 2018-06-23 03:34:47 God help us all if these deadly assault tweets get bump stocks. We'll all be dead within the week! Those of us that somehow survived withdrawing from Paris accords, climate change, net neutrality, peace talks with N.K. and tax cuts lol
2342 2018-06-23 03:34:13 @MicahMcDonald8 The weakness in the Shanghai exchange sure looks like a short bounce should be forthcoming soon. The weakness in the $XLF and $GS shares are compelling considering how well US stocks have held up.

2351 2018-06-23 03:25:39 With current market, should we assume the stocks which are hardly going down are only stocks to buy for next 10 years ?
2352 2018-06-23 03:25:23 I don't think Bank stocks don't have much more upside until real rates actually go up (and stay there). the 10-year needs to get above 3% and hold for a while.
2353 2018-06-23 03:25:16 @BMTheEquityDesk With current market, should we assume the stocks which are hardly going down are only stocks to buy for next 10 years ?
2354 2018-06-23 03:23:57 Conviction to #HODL. If you had hypothetically invested $10k in $NST.AX in May 2010 at 5c (200,000 shares) and free-carried after 1-bagging (retaining 100,000 shares). Investment would now be worth $654k. Demonstrates potential of a stocks that become quality multi-asset plays.

2362 2018-06-23 03:18:42 IMO Stocks’ connection with/decision to draft DD and Gabby give her more leeway than you think. The fight back in the early 4th was a positive too.
2363 2018-06-23 03:16:31 Perhaps one should try looking at it beyond the stocks.

2373 2018-06-23 03:06:16 Right now, even with earnings , good management stocks are hitting low except few latge caps and see no signs of recovery ?
2374 2018-06-23 03:04:50 You haven’t traded equities in a bear market, have you? You sure there is alpha?  How often do you short? Picking stocks while riding positive beta can simply be confirmation bias.  Thoughts?  Not being a dick, just an honest question.
2375 2018-06-23 03:04:50 An interesting fact that I learned in church today is that prisons actually have stocks and out of every 3  black males 1 of them end up getting incarcerated. We pay taxes for the prisons so the ppl who go have some type of “value”.  I mean wowww
2376 2018-06-23 03:04:39 2nd amendment should be regulated to background checks on mental health, domestic violence, etc. I also believe devices like bump stocks should be regulated, but outright banning guns like “assault rifles” is plain ignorance.
2377 2018-06-23 03:03:40 Which biotech stocks you looking at?
2378 2018-06-23 03:03:08 There are two ways to look for stocks

1) Find charts you like and then check their fundamentals

2) Find fundamentally sound stocks and then check their charts

Method 1) often is more efficient. If a stock is fundamentally crap, it often doesn't have a nice chart to begin with

2385 2018-06-23 02:56:37 I was supposed to invest in these stocks when they was $1.50 and $2.40 now they $7.50 and $9.50 and I'm over here feeling like dumbo
2386 2018-06-23 02:54:18 You buy hehe
2387 2018-06-23 02:53:10 Yes, that's why my portfolio isn't that diversified and is mostly just "beta" in drag (tilted toward a few themes, e.g. low-quality stocks, cyclicals, China bubble, FANG bubble, etc.). I'm 300% net short (hedged with calls, pre-deployed when they were cheap, thru September).

Smoot-Hawley, passed the House in May 1929, stocks were battered every time the act moved through the legislative process. On Oct. 23, a Wednesday, it was clear tariffs would be much broader than 1st believed.

The next day, was Black Thursday.
2418 2018-06-23 02:23:06 that's pretty good man, you (who claim to be a veteran penny player) pretended to not realize that PR was fake given the lack of contact information?

2430 2018-06-23 02:15:58 @Scottrades I'm looking for some advice about stocks, I have no idea what I am doing but was intrested in investing in thcx. And tips or thoughts?
2431 2018-06-23 02:15:58 I’m about to be on the other side of the world for two weeks. But I’m more excited about tracking my stocks & the new hot sauce I bought...... what’s wrong with me..?
2432 2018-06-23 02:14:43 Twitter, nope. Stocks, alittle
2433 2018-06-23 02:14:34 To finance this trade deficit, the U.S. has to borrow from the rest of the world or sell American assets like stocks, businesses, and real estate to the rest of the world.
2434 2018-06-23 02:14:29 Best stocks in 5 years: AR gaming companies.
2435 2018-06-23 02:14:15 Of the 30 or so URA stocks, I have only focused on the domestics and some Canadian names due to the 232 affect.  And of course, I am a UEC Bull for quite a few reasons on top of that.
2436 2018-06-23 02:14:05 Following and growing stronger together 
2437 2018-06-23 02:13:59 @billmaher bill watching your guest talk about the AR15. Its one bulletin for each trigger pull, 30 times, not just one bullet. Then there are bump stocks that turn that one trigger pull into an automatic or one pull = 30 bullets. If you want an AR then you must have a license
2438 2018-06-23 02:13:22 The best performing market last week was our Indian market. It has divorced from all developed and emerging markets.
2439 2018-06-23 02:12:56 Again, my 401k Roth IRA is backed in gold. 

Obviously nothings 10000% sound, but Its definitely a security against economic or the dollar collapsing. 

As for the stocks, meh things happen. I save massively and only spend what’s absolutely necessary. I’ll have savings to back me
2440 2018-06-23 02:12:34 I’m really curious to see how those ’s going to perform next season on Duke roster (Zion, Cam Reddish, Barrett, & Tre Jones) obviously they won’t put amazing stats because neither will be the main focus, but if it hurt stocks again that should help my school out alot!
2441 2018-06-23 02:11:29 Think how much the private prison crowd/stocks will make on the new tent cities.
2442 2018-06-23 02:11:29 Told myself I would put all my tips towards stocks! That my new move
2443 2018-06-23 02:11:12 I would not buy stocks yet. A bear market is not a market correction. The latter is a great chance to buy stocks cheaper. In a bear market, you won't know when it hits rock bottom. If I had blue chip stocks though, I'd HOLD till the worse is over.
2444 2018-06-23 02:10:57 Examples?   I see great things.  Economy boomimg.  Lowest unemployment in decades.  World peace is moving forward.. stocks up .. 
2445 2018-06-23 02:10:29 Might not be a bad idea.. my my weed stocks out performed my Crypto - 10 months ago.

2450 2018-06-23 02:08:19 Well, in the next bear market, I would expect everything to crash more or less together--both cyclicals and growth stocks. Your returns will be determined more or less by your beta (whether positive or negative). I have no longs--just call hedges on my shorts.
2451 2018-06-23 02:07:33 i order from stocks to much they be knowing what i want 
2452 2018-06-23 02:06:52 Good question. It's more than coaching though. Dolson being hurt, Sloot missing some time. She is so important to that team. But Stocks is no Pokey...

2455 2018-06-23 02:05:28 manipulation, chasers, chat room "alerts" pushing stocks, people getting excited that something is "low float", or it could just be pure chart technicals.
2456 2018-06-23 02:04:29 that's usually not going to make it a good game... and a telling stat.. how much longer do the Sky stick with Stocks?

Most in the space have 2.5% short % age. So I agree w Quakes too on buyers can feel at ease in some of the URA stocks that completely sold down.

2468 2018-06-23 01:55:23 Dami nagsasabi mura daw ang stocks ngayon. Mura nga po, problem lang, wala din pambili. (Some say Philippines stocks are cheap. It’s cheap alright. Problem is we have no funds to buy them.)
2469 2018-06-23 01:54:46 He recommends either getting index funds or doing 1 hour of research a week per company you invest in. Listening to conference calls is key if you go this route. That’s all I know about stocks. Oh, and diversifying with gold and something in a non-western county.
2470 2018-06-23 01:54:37 Thinking stocks and a basket of rotting fruit would be inappropriate. But message to perpetrators must be robust, that it is wrong and punishable. There must be demonstrated consequences apart from the injury or worse to motorists/victims.

2475 2018-06-23 01:45:29 From IBD's Big Picture Today
Weak action in market-leading growth stocks and an elevated distribution day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are reasons to be cautious, but the Nasdaq showed resilience Friday.
Still, it remains a difficult environment for technical breakouts.

2481 2018-06-23 01:40:01 Ban abortions or quit bumping. Bump stocks require an operator to be effective.  A pregnacy takes a male and female consenting to create an abortion opportunity so ban sex for singles. Go for it funny boy the liberal democrats will castrate you if you do.
2482 2018-06-23 01:39:31 Only part of my retirement is in Wall Street. I purchased a lot of stocks that I’m leaving alone until retirement. 

As for my 401k/Roth Ira it’s partially backed by gold to combat government malarkey and inflation. 

Much safer an option that trusting the government.

2509 2018-06-23 01:08:01 They're still doing it right now. The black whale closures are a complete Cluster***, the crab and mackerel stocks have collapsed, the wharfs are non-functional.

I can't even blame Harper for this one. DFO has been worse than useless for more than 50 years.
2510 2018-06-23 01:07:38 @Gautam__Baid 
Gautam, I am very inspired by your investing journey and life story you recently shared in the public forum. I live and work in the US for the past 4 years and invest mostly Indian stocks . Are there any India based funds I can invest in being in the US?
2511 2018-06-23 01:04:43 The cure for cod stocks was for @DFO_Gulf not to let factory trawlers dredge the seafloor back in the 1970s.  As a kid, I could see them just offshore & all the locals were furious because they were destroying everything.  DFO answer "this is progress". That lasted about 2 years.
2512 2018-06-23 01:03:05 All of these people debating on how many stocks should be in competitive smash ultimate. Ya'll forgetting how it goes tho...
smash 64 did 5 stocks
melee did 4 stocks
brawl did 3 stocks
smash 4 did 2 stocks
ultimate has to be 1 stock. It'd tradition.
2513 2018-06-23 00:59:57 Go-to foundation is ALWAYS out @ultabeauty even when I came on Fri (supposedly restock day, but even then I don’t see new stocks) AND asked clerk to hold it for me (clerk claimed it was in store but was not held by the time I arrived). What’s up with this kind of lie @ultabeauty?

2521 2018-06-23 00:51:53 I only knew oceanic experts: they were replaced by a bunch of yes-men, under Harper. Huge dragging nets, from foreign fishing boats, have turned the bottom of the ocean into a desert. What's the cure, to make cod stocks recover?
2522 2018-06-23 00:51:43 I really want to invest in stocks.
2523 2018-06-23 00:45:13 How did you learn about stocks like did y’all do a bunch of research or something cause I’m so lost about my options and I’m too embarrassed to ask anyone at work
2524 2018-06-23 00:43:58 Over the past couple of months the most shorted stocks have ripped up. A lot of managers have risk controls that force them to cover their shorts if they lose too much money, and the steady gains in the most shorted stocks are likely fueled in part by the covering.

2526 2018-06-23 00:40:05 Trump's EO to ban bump Stocks was 100% unconstitutional in several ways which is why I do not support Trump, or any organization who stands behind him.
2527 2018-06-23 00:38:10 What are you even talking about. You don't understand any of this. Ross broke the law and shorted stocks.
2528 2018-06-23 00:37:33 I get your point i just think we imagine draft stocks improve more often than it actually does. I used to think that too. But even this year if anything you see kids who came back to school sliding down from prior projections more often than up

2542 2018-06-23 00:23:19 Yemen is now & has been sinking beneath the weight of weaponry inside the Country for past 20+ years since a previous War when, at that point, both US Russia & Iran supported the Houthi-supported Government of Yemen (N+S): primary source of Houthi Weapons?

2543 2018-06-23 00:21:45 Thank you for your schooling, I am quite aware how a bill becomes a law.  During a meeting at the White House on school safety, trump said he was going to sign an executive order to ban bump stocks, and proposed raising the age to purchase a gun to 21.

2554 2018-06-23 00:00:32 There were no left over stocks, the only known sample of kaprowskis vaccine was acquired like 30 years later and that sample wasn’t even used in the human trials
2555 2018-06-22 23:59:00 And right off the bat it could be crossed out as false bc left over stocks of the polio vaccines were examined independent laboratories and they all concluded that the vaccines were made with using monkey cells not chimps which completely throws his whole basis out the window
2556 2018-06-22 23:57:16 Look at filings and see if the chart appeals to you.  For example all the big ones bought al the tech stocks.  I was not believing it but after this move this few months , I will never trade against them even if things look over priced

2595 2018-06-22 23:31:17 No, the point was: we’re contending with higher prices (for gas, among other things) while getting no tax break—and no or insufficient wage increase. Corporations are buying back stocks with their tax savings, not increasing wages.

2624 2018-06-22 23:05:33 Stocks are up 100% so I'd ask what the hell did he hurt by use of a word that blacks use every second of everyday?
2625 2018-06-22 23:04:26 What would happen if the 1% with a conscience pulled their money from banks, stocks, etc? Really hit Trump where it hurts- the economy is only “thriving” on the 1% spending. If that money were removed... what would happen. Halt the economy?
2626 2018-06-22 23:03:26 You will be unsurprised to hear that he was also bragging about his stocks.
2627 2018-06-22 23:01:00 Hes not a real person, scam artist who has made bank on 3 runs now
2628 2018-06-22 22:58:00 Salma.. Ida cje&m chrat stocks.. Bla matme7en pledis.. Khelihom idiro khedma dialhom.. Machi kolchi mosekh 7ta nta twessekh m3ahom..or else they wont be unique
2629 2018-06-22 22:57:27 Ahan! My question is from an investment point of view. Is this the right time to buy dollar? Because I personally feel that PSX will make a correction and ideally investment in stocks can be fruitful after election. Your say?
2630 2018-06-22 22:55:43 More fake news
2631 2018-06-22 22:55:25 We all know who they will blame but their is always more to see behind the story. Why was a strike called when coal stocks were at their highest? Why was it called as summer approached? Why was OUR government not allowed to subsidise OUR coal industry?
2632 2018-06-22 22:55:23 OMG! So fake. Nobody believes you
2633 2018-06-22 22:54:43 I would need some time to investigate. I’ll check it out let you know what I find.
2634 2018-06-22 22:54:09 If FEMA does their job, and releases the stocks of emergency  bourbon, I and millions of others will be saved from a fate worse than death.
2635 2018-06-22 22:53:58 His tweets literally made OPEC produce more oil and thus lowering gas prices. Stocks break records. Unemployment break records. North Korea will de nuke. Reverse policy from 2010 separating families at borders. ISIS stomped. For shame ... Shame I say!
2636 2018-06-22 22:52:52 @_Louie__ look into @MotiveWave software. Great analytical tooks for technical analysis, let's you create your own aggregate instruments. Recently started using it myself for stocks with IB data.
2637 2018-06-22 22:52:43 Think I'll buy some stocks this weekend instead.
2638 2018-06-22 22:52:13 John Q & Ocean, Dont you think the sectors stocks held up pretty nicely with this rebalancing hanging over their heads? Once done we seem to have some pretty nice sailing coming.  Also, Utilities generally dont buy  much in Q1 or the 2nd half of Q4.  Q2 through Q4 is the time!
2639 2018-06-22 22:49:16 Lost a bit in stocks this week-but will recover
You don’t have to be a Billionaire-that’s a Pelosi Lie
Our projected taxes went  A LOT

GDP may hit close to 4% this month

2642 2018-06-22 22:45:48 I had 9 stocks until last week but selling some them like $BZUN $MOMO $PVTL $MU $SOGO to buy more from the others in my portfolio. Just selling the ones that are quiet and buying more the ones falling . Need to see rebound next week .

2647 2018-06-22 22:40:25 “We’re not doing shit this deadline except piss off our fan base and make them the laughing stocks of every bar in the frustrate area” is what it translates too....loosely I think
2648 2018-06-22 22:40:06 Trump policies- Supporters, REALLY think on this!(3)
His tax plan. Cut Corp taxes hugely, very little for citizens. "More in paycheck" isn't enough to make a difference.
Resulted in HUGE savings for Corp/wealthy
Corps buy back stocks results in huge CEOs raises, Wells...
2649 2018-06-22 22:39:51 Buy Property Invest In Stocks Open Up Businesses
2650 2018-06-22 22:38:49 Ah oui ! :/ mais je pense qu'elles font toujours des points sur les stocks. Après il faut savoir que Reign n'était pas aussi connu qu'OTH et donc il y avait moins de demandes :/
2651 2018-06-22 22:35:19 These are the 2 stocks in technology sector that yesterday marked all-time highs:
$AMSWA, $MPWR
2652 2018-06-22 22:35:08 Time to get off this crazy roller coaster and back into fiat / stocks, too much for an old man like me. Thanks for the wild ride over the years #BTC / ALTS! 
2653 2018-06-22 22:34:16 OMG! Thanks for offering. I wish but SM never stocks in my size :(
2654 2018-06-22 22:33:15 Well it has to be good after the last two films otherwise it will be like somone nuked Disney's stocks
2655 2018-06-22 22:30:52 uh, where they used to actually trade stocks?  j/k Good for you, love your work.

I just wish the old NYSE wasn't only a TV studio now. It's a shame.
2656 2018-06-22 22:30:33 Why don’t you trot out pictures of the Las Vegas victims in support of banning bump stocks? You have no heart. Zero. The audience cannot feel it. Those who pretend they do our part of your cult #AllAboutMoneyForYou and #Whiteprivilege Which is a nice way to say #WhiteSupremacy
2657 2018-06-22 22:30:19 These are the 9 stocks in finance sector that yesterday made all-time highs:

2658 2018-06-22 22:29:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2659 2018-06-22 22:26:14 $RBIZ I see gonsilee is on IHub Message board! He is known for bashing stocks! but he's on the opposite side this time! SMH  My knowledge and experience tells me to lock profits asap next week! Good luck to all!
2660 2018-06-22 22:25:25 nooooooooo, ok, you're making it possible for me to buy stocks on toothpicks, toothpaste, floss, Listerine mouth wash, Alka Seltzer, tums, and vomiting bags
2661 2018-06-22 22:25:19 2 finance stocks jumped strong on Friday:
$ARL 10.2%, $VALU 18.9%
2662 2018-06-22 22:24:53 Free no strings attached unfunded tax cut $ given to corporations with pre-existing conditions of record profits and cash on  hand they used to buy back stocks & help themselves should not be paid for by taking healthcare away from people with pre-existing illnesses.

FRAUDULANT
2663 2018-06-22 22:23:38 The #Hodeida port remains open and there are sufficient food stocks available to sustain 6 million Yemenis for the next month. #HumanitarianAid #ArabCoalition
2664 2018-06-22 22:23:26 its one of those stocks you just keep playin cause its profitable with high or low IVR
2665 2018-06-22 22:22:52 Oil stocks are low, gold and copper arr low too; i think the comodities supercycle can push this market in a new bull market
2666 2018-06-22 22:21:37 @SRuhle how can private prisons be non-profit and sell stocks?
2667 2018-06-22 22:21:29  Excellent !!!
Pour répondre à vos questions, le dîner à été annulé... Vous n'étiez pas dispo... Dommage, mais on va reporter l'affaire 
Et en ce qui concerne la carapils... Les stocks on été vidés par vos amis de la fgtb pour les prochains bbq plus une seule canette ! 
2668 2018-06-22 22:20:47 Seeing liberals this week, I wonder how the stocks for companies that make straitjackets are doing. I'd guess they're up sharply.
2669 2018-06-22 22:18:44 man, it will only take you so far, 
until you realize that you should 
be turning that knowledge of stocks and bonds 
on to wall street!  
#BetterAskSomebody
2670 2018-06-22 22:18:30 Prison stocks are UP as we make room for more babies ... Defense sticks are DOWN because of peace talks ... #Flint still doesn’t have clean water and apparently our active military  doesn’t either.We are cutting food stamps so the rich can have a tax cut and #Yemen #UpsideDown
2671 2018-06-22 22:15:34 A smart person stocks several masks for different situation.. The moment you let them see your true vulnerability, it’s out on the streets.
2672 2018-06-22 22:15:04 We all know President Trump got balls . But I never done stocks before only reason I'm here is cause I saw your ad. And TO find out Just how Great you Are or Think you are. Like I said don't know anything about stocks can't hardly make ends meet most of the time I can't.
2673 2018-06-22 22:12:54 Walgreens will always have my business because it’s the only store I know that stocks Jujubes and your boy likes his candy

2678 2018-06-22 22:11:29 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer Should we really put much faith in the DJIA historical trends since Dow Jones routinely replaces dying stocks like GE with advancing ones like Walgreens?  Obvious attempts to keep the DJIA look like its moving higher. Thx.

2680 2018-06-22 22:10:09 One of the effects of Trump’s protectionist policy and the repeated Fed rate hikes has been that US investors liquidated their overseas positions and invested their free capital back into US stocks and treasuries. #dailynews #earn2trade #Fed #Trump #markets #US #policy #stocks
2681 2018-06-22 22:09:12 thanks! glad the last 2 weeks of focusing on these big boy #stocks is paying off 
2682 2018-06-22 22:08:33 My insurance premiums are higher, I had to increase my deductible, gas prices are up and my mortgage payment went up while my stocks went down. You are a lying criminal enterprise and history will shame your families forever!
2683 2018-06-22 22:07:53 The more I look at Bitcoin, the more it reminds me of rare earth stocks, whick were featured daily on @CNBC in 2011.... until they blew up and never heard of them again! And @BKBrianKelly will probably gain another 25 pounds because he eats his emotions!
2684 2018-06-22 22:06:59 Le port de #Hodeïda reste ouvert, et les stocks alimentairesdisponibles suffisent à subvenir aux besoins alimentaires de 6 millions de Yéménites le long du mois prochain.#AideHumanitaire #La_Coalition_arabe
2685 2018-06-22 22:06:36 Think  it’s time to go to stocks ... since we already bricked bitcoin 
2686 2018-06-22 22:06:18 control together about 68% or so.  A MR shutdn extension would be so huge but that is what both giants want and it helps all of the U world stocks.  A yes on 232 helps only domestic stocks in huge fashion too but not KAZ and balance of world suppliers. UEC has extra catalysts.
2687 2018-06-22 22:05:28 $OSTK This one gets so much attention. I continue to simply avoid. Too many other good stocks

2689 2018-06-22 22:03:48 I would definitely recommend. I felt the exact same and really came out of it that there were positives and had new ideas. Do it, do it do it 
2690 2018-06-22 22:03:36 I agree Jae. 
But their is also the concept of time value. 
We look at prices of stocks, their EV/EBITDA and other xyz's of then and now, but what was value of Rupee / Dollar then, and how much is it now
2691 2018-06-22 22:03:26 Eu nao tenho o controle emocional do Soros. Porque eu compro teses de investimento, ele nao compra teses. Ele testa teses de especulação elaboradas (currencies, stocks, derivatives). Gênio! Eu nao consigo fazer o que ele faz com tanta eficiência.
2692 2018-06-22 22:02:40 The game is over when you cash out, until then you have not lost anything.   If you are as smart as you think you are you should know that. No more risky than playing stocks. Fiat is worthless and not backed by anything anymore!
2693 2018-06-22 22:02:12 You want to talk intelligence levels, let’s add common sense to the equation! Lower taxes, more small businesses staying alive & well, stocks at an all time high, more people employed, including blacks & women. Take your meds and set fire to car!

2695 2018-06-22 22:00:13 Money you’ll need in 1-5 years— Should be liquid cash; easily accessible if you need it
5-10 years—Can be in a mix stocks, bonds, cash
10 years or more—Put it into your long term wealth strategy such as stocks, real estate, commodities

2696 2018-06-22 21:57:34 Dude, you literally cannot dent it’s hurting their stock. Do you even know what stock is? Their investors are pulling money from them which hurts any business. It’s on the news and if you don’t believe me, pull up your stocks app.
2697 2018-06-22 21:56:33 Is not hurting Sony stocks at all, the PS4 is one of Sony’s most successful consoles when it comes to attach rate and games sold, so I don’t know what you are talking about
2698 2018-06-22 21:56:17 That makes me think Twitter account might be fake all together from day one!
2699 2018-06-22 21:55:04 @pearsonsglass  fantastic service, quick delivery. Great to have finally found a supplier who stocks the old glass patterns of years gone by
2700 2018-06-22 21:54:30 What would happen if the 1% with a conscience went on strike with their money? Pulled it from banks, stocks, etc.? What would happen to Trumps thriving economy? 

Curious...
2701 2018-06-22 21:53:40 Thank you, stocks must be low couldn’t see it tonight.
2702 2018-06-22 21:53:38 Nintendo stocks dropped after their E3 showing, it happens all the time buddy
2703 2018-06-22 21:53:17 Ed, I think she may be beyond help. She clearly doesn't know the facts or the laws.
Although, you are quite correct; if you just want to see how fast you can shoot downrange, they aren't that impressive. As for accuracy, not after the first shot.
Bump stocks are actually useless.
2704 2018-06-22 21:52:02 @OptionsAction 
Living in Florida I really miss seeing men in Business Suits.         I love watching CNBC, the suits the stocks, the ties!  ?  What will happen to Brooks brothers & Saks  #stock @jimcramer always has a tie    ;)
2705 2018-06-22 21:51:57 Not enough time for trading at the moment. 

So im out of all stocks and just keep investing in XRP

Cryptos will change the world! And XRP has the best usecase for me! #xrpcommunity
2706 2018-06-22 21:51:30 I don't ever recommend shorting, especially OTC stocks
2707 2018-06-22 21:51:02 My boss gave me unasked advice on a new car to buy. "Yeah man, get a brand new Kia, they have a 10 year warranty etc"
Like yeah fam, you sure do pay me enough to afford that. I'll get right on it. While you're at it, wanna tell me what stocks to invest in? 
2708 2018-06-22 21:50:56 Bye
2709 2018-06-22 21:49:17 Is the Navy outsourcing to private for prison orgs for this? No wonder Private Prison stocks went up 43% on Nov. 9, 2016.
How much money will these prisons cost us?
2710 2018-06-22 21:47:54 I highly doubt Boston or Lowell would do that. Also it's Canadian people that move these stocks and they probably will never hear about it. 

Thanks to @BKingCapital for chillin me out lol
2711 2018-06-22 21:47:05 And your education is being used to "trade" stocks or any other asset class?
2712 2018-06-22 21:43:11 @Jesus_YaHWeH_ where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
2713 2018-06-22 21:42:35 Completely agree. Also, not even bank CEOs fully understand what’s going on inside their companies - it’s too complex. (First-hand off-the-record admission). Doesn’t mean one can’t make money on bank stocks, perhaps the opposite
2714 2018-06-22 21:41:47 The Vanguard Group Owns The Corrections Corporation of America & All Major Record Labels. Which Means They Have Prison Stocks Which Means They Need Them Filled So They Can Profit. That’s Where The Record Labels Come Into Play
2715 2018-06-22 21:41:45 Almost 8 mil so I see a block trade must have gone through.  Why?  16X on average volume but no price move. So, it will be interesting so see wha URA's position in UUUU is tomorrow. UEC had 4X volume and up 5.4%. Those are the only 2 Uranium stocks with odd volume to theup side.
2716 2018-06-22 21:41:44 Bump stocks do not convert a rifle to full auto...  in fact most competitive shooters think they are a joke because your finger can move faster, and the make your accuracy shit. 

Again you are proving your ignorance...  stop quoting gun grabber news and get educated
2717 2018-06-22 21:41:39 But those penny stocks...
2718 2018-06-22 21:40:55 Evening Market Wrap-Up: stocks closed slightly higher giving up early gains. See Open Picks for revisions.
2719 2018-06-22 21:40:30 Interesting idea but needs work. What's to stop that skilled workforce upping stocks and moving to whatever employer offers them a better deal - whether that's money or a nice climate, decent schools for their kids and cheap housing?
2720 2018-06-22 21:39:42 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2721 2018-06-22 21:36:16 All fencing trellis and decking in stock now at great prices massive stocks.
2722 2018-06-22 21:36:08 @realDonaldTrump Hey Super Intelligent..the NASA was never closed..who do you think works together with the ESA in the ISS..wich is btw the first and only permanent orbital space station..count your stocks and not telling lies.
2723 2018-06-22 21:35:33 SEC is investing the “rounding error” in company earnings.  Seriously? Doesn’t it all wash out in the end?  How about investigating things like flash crashes, message boards on stocks, or even good old fashioned ethics in some of these investment companies?
2724 2018-06-22 21:35:32 Imagine caping for him as a prospect, ogling his AtRim% and stocks per 40 and having him higher than all your draft twitter friends :)

2729 2018-06-22 21:31:15 But only in stocks? That in itself makes no sense. They are the same investors making the same move, yet in one they’re smart and in one they’re dumb. I know you joke, but advisors market this information as a reason you / we need advice.
2730 2018-06-22 21:30:24 lmao 20% tariff onto European-made vehicles... time buy now and throw some stocks out
2731 2018-06-22 21:30:04 When you look at something like equities where flow differential is HUGE you’ll have a larger impact than bonds where it’s been smaller (but material as % of AUM flows). Basically with stocks comparing far left bucket to far right bucket and pretending their the same bucket.
2732 2018-06-22 21:30:03 What good is it that the money I make in stocks just goes into rising gas prices..  ehhh. Your starting to piss me off. Your screwing people out of medication that people have been on for 10 yrs. Not all people are junkies. Your going to ruin American family's lives.
2733 2018-06-22 21:29:48 Cool, so when they leave their minimum wage jobs and get the high paying jobs that don't exist, who cooks your food? Who stocks the shelves of your supermarket? Who delivers your pizza and dry cleans your clothes and cleans your house? 
2734 2018-06-22 21:29:44 I saw it got deleted. That is whack man...

2737 2018-06-22 21:27:18 Trump's fucking up my money with China. My stocks are plummeting
2738 2018-06-22 21:26:47 We know why that is, because he refuses to do ANYTHING about gun control, he lied about banning bump stocks and raising age to buy assault style weapons to 21, because he's a liar.
2739 2018-06-22 21:26:02 Yeah, I'm not the knee jerk reaction type.  Stocks are filled with fair weather folks, and weathering the storm isn't easy at times
2740 2018-06-22 21:26:01 all 4 of those stocks i mentioned were booted from the russell today so that may be why

2743 2018-06-22 21:24:45 A guy Christopher hired to take the test (SEC compliance officer)
starts a scheme to pump and dump fake stocks
2744 2018-06-22 21:24:13 Ok but where’s the adult version of BrainPOP that tells me shit like how to balance a checkbook and how to know which stocks to invest in?
2745 2018-06-22 21:23:53 They are licking their chops for Ricky!
2746 2018-06-22 21:23:45 What do all of these market meltdowns have in common? 

-Nifty Fifty stocks in the early '70s
-Japanese stocks & real estate in the late '80s
-Tech stocks of the late '90s
-Real estate in the mid 2000s

People paid too dear a price for their assets. 

Price matters.
2747 2018-06-22 21:23:42 Ban bump stocks now!
2748 2018-06-22 21:22:15 Tesla stocks declined again. Jah know.
2749 2018-06-22 21:20:58 I have some cash and looking for overseas dividend stocks with growth potential to diversity my portfolio since is high porcentaje in US. Any advise @TheDividendGuy. #dividends #investing
2750 2018-06-22 21:20:49 You f*cking joke. Sending JAG Corps to prosecute misdemeanor immigration crimes instead of FELONY violent crimes or FELONY white collar crimes (e.g. repeatedly lying on one’s SF-86 like @jaredkushner, or insider trading like @SecretaryRoss’s short-selling of stocks in early 2018)
2751 2018-06-22 21:19:42 “But I’ll keep railing about it because I’m a One-Trick Show Horse!”
2752 2018-06-22 21:19:40 @OpTic_BigTymeR how does a company adding more stocks into the market work?
2753 2018-06-22 21:19:27 Stocks food pantries *in schools*. Sorry, I'm so pissed I can hardly type.
2754 2018-06-22 21:19:21 This is nothing compared to the families who have lost children from Americans with bump stocks or military weapons that you support for NRA(RUSSIAN) dollars. 
Nice try....you just came empty
2755 2018-06-22 21:19:13 I disagree. Today they got after all the aggressive growth stocks. Look at WDAY SPLK RHT
2756 2018-06-22 21:18:38 Support your local groups helping food insecure families. It's crucial! @LOCKERPROJECTME is a wonderful organization in Maine who stocks food pantries in my state of Maine and they can use all the help they can get!
2757 2018-06-22 21:18:33 If regional storage facility has its stocks exactly as same as national storage facility, this will be perfect. Congratulations team!

2759 2018-06-22 21:17:32 I had a couple stocks for one month but I brought a couple more like 4 days ago and still made profit
2760 2018-06-22 21:16:24 Good riddance to bad rubbish. Put them in the stocks and throw rotten fruit.
Also, don't trust anyone who calls themselves a liberal and apologizes rapists and abusers.
2761 2018-06-22 21:16:21 Market Close: MBS -2bps; DOW +119.19; NASDAQ -20.13; S&P 500 +5.12; 10yr Treasury 2.90%; Stocks closed Mixed, as the DOW rebounded after 8 days of losses; MBS and Yields close near unchanged levels.
2762 2018-06-22 21:15:17 The Dow Jones industrial average ended its eight-day losing streak Friday, lifted by energy stocks amid a crude rally. The dollar fell, and Treasury yields inched higher.
2763 2018-06-22 21:15:08 Value investing at the end of the day is just about two things 
1. Buying quality stocks 
2. Holding for a ln average time period of 10 years. 
But it's never this simple. This is why people continue to make mistakes.
2764 2018-06-22 21:14:44 Does the fishing closer apply to First Nations as well? Since they use nets, this is extremely detrimental to fish stocks and stergon in the Fraser River.

2777 2018-06-22 21:07:42 Wilbur Ross is accused of ‘shorting’ stocks by unloading them ahead of a loss expected, using information he gained by virtue of his position.

2804 2018-06-22 20:59:49 Look. Stocks are up and down with every tweet. They should be way up with the tax windfall companies received, but for the last few days they've been tanking due to tariffs. A better plan would have been to give that tax $$ back to us. I'm tired of making the Rich richer.

2829 2018-06-22 20:43:09 What's going on with the stocks reverse split? did I use lose on my shares?

2831 2018-06-22 20:41:45 Yep... for about 2 months.... I sold a few stocks because of this silly impulse that are doing extremely well now

2835 2018-06-22 20:39:54 2. Government, while under control of capitalist class, gives massive tax breaks to corporations, pass-through businesses and highest income earners. Corporations buy back stocks and reward executives.

2852 2018-06-22 20:30:50 Thanks for telling me that. I do as much as I can to better my skills in investing in stocks but Im still relatively new. Ive kept up with the market for the last 4yrs and Im about to graduate. if you dont mind is It okay if I can pick your brain when I see a stock?

2856 2018-06-22 20:27:35 That's why I loaded last week & this week in anticipation but I originally got into it for the hemp patents (McConnell is not backing down on that bill). Plus I love stocks with upcoming catalysts and lots of very tired bagholders willing to get out b/c of fatigue/frustration.
2857 2018-06-22 20:27:26 Oil actually outperformed many "oily" stocks today. Aren't they supposed to be leveraged to the underlying?
2858 2018-06-22 20:25:57 Stock market highs mean very little to most people, as 80 percent of all stocks are owned by the top 10 percent. The bottom 40% own no stock at all.
2859 2018-06-22 20:25:44 Pete, wish I could but compliance restrictions prohibit me from commenting on specific stocks. 

We were heavily in names like Reservoir, Kaminak and Mariana well ahead of takeovers, so we have a pretty good track record of picking them ;).

2862 2018-06-22 20:22:25 How about Carl Icahn? Icahn was a former advisor to trump & sold off millions of $$$ in stocks he owned in a steel dependent co. Icahn did this just days before the president publicly announced big tariffs on foreign made steel. It appears he made a good bit of $$$ from this sale
2863 2018-06-22 20:22:13 If (big if) this is true then we have a commerce secretary (who will take a lead position in any trade conflict) does not understand the difference between devistment and hedging, and only knows how to sell stocks if he phisicaly holds the certificates
2864 2018-06-22 20:21:41 Foreign stocks that Wilbur Ross has short sold to avoid prosecution.
2865 2018-06-22 20:21:28 Sadly the poor die off around that age, leaving only people with more money to vote for corporations and wall st probably hoping to benefit their personal retirement stocks
2866 2018-06-22 20:21:05 Like $SPY, $XLF has some good stocks & some bad ones. I prefer to play them individually or the range in $XLF. I'll assume it's in a range, until it's not.
2867 2018-06-22 20:21:00 Probably missed that news. When the mania started my business partner tried to convince me. I bought stocks of Nvidia and AMD instead. Still prefer my strategy.
2868 2018-06-22 20:20:59 @jimcramer Hello jim, All you do is so appreciated. I am new to stocks, bought your book and am trying to turn a few thousand into a house down payment. But to buy only 1 share each of the FANG club is almost all i have. Any advice to us home rookies would give a lot of hope.
2869 2018-06-22 20:20:37 I agree with those sentiments. In sectors where I have the expertise, I select individual stocks. In sectors where I want to invest but have no expertise, I choose index ETF and funds.
2870 2018-06-22 20:20:21 @karansharma_09 you are doing a wonderful job in digging so much information and compiling it for all. I recently started following you and was wondering if you have recently pulled out the top 10 stocks which are primarily responsible for the high returns of top mutual funds.
2871 2018-06-22 20:20:17 I bet stocks rise thru the roof 2marrow

2882 2018-06-22 20:16:18 Too right m8. I've watched primarily 3 stocks all week. Traded just 4 basic setups. 80%win rate. Simplicity and patience wins every time.
2883 2018-06-22 20:16:16 Oh yea. High stocks, high GDP, lowest unemployment in 17 years, lowest minority unemployment, lower taxes for both business and individuals, peace in Korea, NK destroyed multiple site, China has invested billions, pulled out of the bias human rights committee and much more.
2884 2018-06-22 20:15:59 A fact about stocks: the capitalization of the US stock market was $29.2 trillion as of 3/31/18, or just 70% of the size of the US bond market as of the same date (source: Wilshire).

2886 2018-06-22 20:15:36 Typical summer Friday - after strong a.m. activity dried up and stocks limped into the close. However, Dow snapped 8 day losing streak while Nasdaq down, S&P up. Breadth nicely positive - both 2 to 1. For the week: Dow down 2%; S&P down 0.9%; Nasdaq down 0.7%.
2887 2018-06-22 20:15:19 Stocks trade back and forth, end mostly higher after Thurs slump. Energy sector leads as oil resurges. Techs weak.

Dow +119, +0.3% to 24,580
Nasdaq -0.3%, S&P +0.2%

Winners top losers 2/1 on NYSE, 16/14 on Nasdaq

For week Dow -2.0%, Nasdaq -0.7%, S&P -0.9%

2891 2018-06-22 20:13:05 World stocks rally: Europe +1.1%; US +.2%. Investors bought stocks from oversold market believing that economic fundamentals would be strong enough to outweigh any possible trade debacle. Market may drift down until trade issues settled with occasional spikes of scary volatility.
2892 2018-06-22 20:12:50 #US Close: $NASDAQ-0.26% stepped back after recent date with record highs, while $DJIA+0.49% $SPX+0.19%. Banks, Food, Tobacco, F&B stocks advanced. PMI activity weakened across the board in June. Trade palpitations renewed with Trumps' latest tweet.
2893 2018-06-22 20:12:28 For sure.  I was buying heavy yesterday when stocks sold off to absurd levels, even in relation to what I thought were absurd crude $ levels. I sold off financials, and consumer stocks, just to free up cash to grab the opportunity.

Yes. When it crashes, it will somehow be Obama's fault. 
3005 2018-06-22 19:10:05 Earnings Season is almost here.  When Q2 is fully in, earnings for the first six months of 2018 will stand 10-15% above Dec 31 levels, but the S&P 500 is up only 3.3% so far this year.  Pressure is building to take stocks higher.
3006 2018-06-22 19:09:31 I’m over here investing in stocks, when I never thought I’d get the hang of it
3007 2018-06-22 19:08:20 One of the common mistakes that #traders make is getting into a position too early or too late, best way to avoid this is to wait for a healthy #pullback in the #stocks price THEN get in.

3030 2018-06-22 18:52:23 Well essentially this country was founded on immigrants. Immigrants coming here barely had any significance with the Great Depression. The economy was shaky and everyone withdrew their stocks at the same time. States set up laws to keep poor migrants out (oakies, etc.).

3070 2018-06-22 18:31:55 Good string. I quibble with comparing eras as lucky in timing. Different yes but stocks have been the best invest alternative with lower vol over 30+ yr rolling periods.

3119 2018-06-22 18:02:36 You should learn about diversification. Holding a portfolio of stocks decreases the impacts of fluctuations in any one stock. Math shows that about 20 stocks from different industries is optimal. You can also get that by simply buying a pre-diversified ETF.
3120 2018-06-22 18:01:44 As long as health care is traded on the stock market there will never be affordability. The same people who howl about the cost of prescription drugs or health care in general also own stocks in those same companies and don't connect the dots.
3121 2018-06-22 18:01:07 The stock market is a cruel bedfellow when you feel optimistic and future looks bright it sometimes jolts into reality. In This goldilocks period aware.

3124 2018-06-22 18:00:18 What are the numbers of Utahans addicted to opioids but who think it’s not as bad as marijuana because the @LDSchurch has $300 million in pharmaceutical stocks?
3125 2018-06-22 17:59:40 That short-selling thing is far more convoluted than I imagined.     Is there no way to set up stocks with an agreement that lending stocks to 3rd parties invalidates the stock. That's what happens with a bus pass or concert ticket.
3126 2018-06-22 17:59:20 Thanks for sharing. Makes a great case for diversifying by asset classes (US stocks, international stocks, bonds, etc.), as well as strategies (buy and hold, trend following).
3127 2018-06-22 17:59:18 I have been trying  to invest in renewable energy stocks for 5 years. Brokers refused to invest my money. All stated in the past 4 years that Trump would distroy that Business Sector in America. I am happy to see them fighting back & surviving. I am still looking for a broker
3128 2018-06-22 17:59:18 Share buybacks have been a significant theme with major income producing stocks, which is my primary area of investment interest. I dont think this will translate into the junior exploration markets,I fully support your position that valuations are depressed. 

Fundamentals win.

3136 2018-06-22 17:54:17 What stocks and industries generally can we expect to do well as a result of the trade war with China?
3137 2018-06-22 17:53:58 1) yes
2) no... I’m assuming the major gaps M* reports between active and passive (and difference of that gap in stocks and bonds) is the trend of flows from high to low fee and active to passive + market performance (not behavior)

3150 2018-06-22 17:49:33 I’m with ya, can’t go wrong accumulating at this bottom range. Silver really testing investor patience but I think silver is one of the most undervalued assets right now. Uranium was a close second but those stocks have been ripping lately.
3151 2018-06-22 17:49:03 I know what Agenda21 is. Do you think that Trump truly cares about you? He’s shorting stocks for his buddies. Mark my words you will regret this. You think this white nationalism shit won’t affect you, it will. Someone you know or care about will be affected.
3152 2018-06-22 17:48:42 It's never wise to torture ourselves due to missed opportunities. We will never be in all the top stocks out there, we just need to be in some of them in our lifetime and with enough sizing to make an impact 
3153 2018-06-22 17:47:58 lots of swings in weed stocks as predicted.... too bad I didn't short some weed stocks today... It is fun to long and short weed stocks at the same time 
3154 2018-06-22 17:47:52 What other long term stocks do you hold stew? Now might be a good chance to pick some up. As a Canadian I don't really have any us listed stocks long term.

3195 2018-06-22 17:25:58 Thanks Spartan, I just trade movements in stocks is all, OTC is about as volatile both good and bad as it gets in trading in the stock market, its definitely a high risk / high reward type market. 
3196 2018-06-22 17:25:23 Exactly.  Blocks have to be used for stocks like URG and UUUU and some others.  Dont forget we have some IPOs on the cusps so their Addendum to push out some sales to Q3 may be due to that too since it provides customers beyond the Funds that want shares now.  Just my guess.

3210 2018-06-22 17:17:02 How is protecting the oceans a waste of money? If you don't protect the oceans, you get overfishing. Fishing stocks go down. Fisheries go out of business. People don't eat. Seriously do you have some kind of brain atrophy?
3211 2018-06-22 17:15:12 Stocks perform and companies make money because lot of people live from paycheck to paycheck.
3212 2018-06-22 17:14:11 because these stocks have so much range you can make good money off of just 20-100 shares. and then as your account grows you can bump up your positions. plus if you want %gains i have a super safe options strat that is super easy and not like everyone else.
3213 2018-06-22 17:14:10 The lag time before policy effect is too long. The policy is the result of damage to stocks and the oceans that already appear. They can lead to critical results that may be impossible to cope with. Change is needed now.

3234 2018-06-22 17:03:10 Agreeing with you. Meant I won’t be sad when the scammy and mostly worthless alt market turns to penny stocks. The entire 2017/2018 ico experiment has been nothing more than a dilutive cash grab of copied code and ideas.
3235 2018-06-22 17:03:05 A $1.5 TRILLION dollar bill for that tax cut to the wealthiest corporations and billionaires like yourself.  It's not helping the economy. But it is helping the stock market for certain stocks, which is a totally different thing.

3252 2018-06-22 16:55:08 Actually, the increase was not as much as expected and oil related stocks are rallying on the news. Oil is still going up and staying up. Nice try. #FactsMatter

3266 2018-06-22 16:50:53 @ScottWapnerCNBC My take on Micron-UBS analysts (like many other dishonest brokers) downgrade stocks to bring down the price so their clients can get in at a discount. Since the downgrade is false, the stock goes back up in a few days.

3272 2018-06-22 16:47:53 Well, my background in economics and finance disagrees with your advice. I was up 19.6% last year and 7% or so this year with minimal risk exposure. Picking stocks, like you suggest, is a dying art and a good way to lose your ass. Best of luck to you.

3274 2018-06-22 16:46:37 European autos stocks have been a major victim of escalating tariff rhetoric, particularly targeting German carmakers’ exports to the United States, and the autos index was set for its worst week since January 2016 as tensions climbed.

3282 2018-06-22 16:44:37 Europe’s autos stocks sold off rapidly, down as much as 1.3 percent, and Germany’s DAX index fell into negative territory, down 0.2 percent as big German carmakers Daimler, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW, which are heavily reliant on U.S. car sales, suffered.

3285 2018-06-22 16:43:06 Guys this "stock market is gonna crash and crypto will go up" narrative sounds nice but I don't believe it. Rekt investors aren't going to pour the rest of their $ into crypto. They don't believe in it. They don't want to chase something they see as being riskier than stocks.
3286 2018-06-22 16:42:48 @APStylebook What are the guidelines for referencing a cryptocurrency's token? Would the same rules apply as for stocks?

3289 2018-06-22 16:42:02 going against the grain here, but I see a nice correction coming for FAANG stocks, & will most likely take the rest of the market w/ it. Nice correction, leading into a rise in Fall to close out the year strong . I see Bitcoin rising if this takes place. $uvxy & Put options!

3381 2018-06-22 16:04:20 This is true in some cases but if playing penny stocks the majority I follow never hold their gain.  Can you even name 5 or 10 that are up on the year?

3386 2018-06-22 16:01:16 I can't emphasize it enough: Sell your weakest stocks. Look at $NTNX or $TWLO. They pullback and show not any sign of rebound. Instead they are below their 20 MA. It could be a shakeout, but you can re-enter anytime later.

3392 2018-06-22 15:58:17 Wages have climbed 3%, yet inflation has grown 3% for a net zero change, tax cuts are temporary and permanent tax cuts cater to corporations not individuals- corporations are using tax cuts to buy back stocks- not reinvest in the economy, workers or salaries. This is crazy.

3407 2018-06-22 15:52:17 There are some deals out there. Of course be under no illusion that if the (really expensive) growth stocks come down they won't, at least temporarily, make what's cheap much cheaper. But market timing is a tricky business so maybe leg in over time.
3408 2018-06-22 15:51:58 Maybe it was a message to you!  What happened to school safety, not being afraid of the NRA, bump stocks, etc. where was and is the assistance to Puerto Rico after Hurricane?   You are worthless in any crisis!  So is your Administration!
3409 2018-06-22 15:51:12 The Recession will hit far sooner than any of the investors say... They still want you to invest to make them richer before they sell off all their stocks

3506 2018-06-22 15:08:36 I wonder if you and your friends and associates have had short sales on any stocks affected by your tweets
3507 2018-06-22 15:08:30 Does Trump (or his friends and family) short any of the stocks he so casually talks down?  Is anyone checking?
3508 2018-06-22 15:07:46 $DMPI $STAF both of these 2 #stocks are in big oversold territory. #BuyOnTheDips #FridayMotivation
3509 2018-06-22 15:07:27 @larry_kudlow U.S. stocks were mixed after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on cars imported from the European Union and as the biggest technology companies declined. NEED MARKETS TO BE UP FOR MIDTERMS! Do this AFTER the Midterms! NEED VOTES!!!
3510 2018-06-22 15:07:22 This is hilarious. They really think he cares if they're in peril? He urged his casino employees to buy stocks in the company knowing it was failing.
3511 2018-06-22 15:06:21 may stocks pa hoho
3512 2018-06-22 15:06:13 no, but in this depressing week the point is reached that the gut is puked out ...sry...and finally more cannot be sold in stocks...(that is why I bought yesterday evening because the market was scalped too fast)
3513 2018-06-22 15:06:07 My retirement money in small company stocks is wY out since election. In fact took out $80,000 and it is getting back up to where it looks like I didn’t take much out. You must not own stock!
3514 2018-06-22 15:05:47 When stocks are beaten down beyond a point, no bad news is also good news.
3515 2018-06-22 15:05:41 Once again you tip off your cronies to dump their stocks. Isn’t that illegal?
3516 2018-06-22 15:05:20 Should put him in stocks for 48 hours.   Bring back old time punishment for arseholes
3517 2018-06-22 15:05:12 Goodmorning, today seems like a good day for scalping stocks. So many movers!
3518 2018-06-22 15:04:18 Thoughts on how it could affect stocks today? Think it would affect a move imminently
3519 2018-06-22 15:04:03 Vow. Outstanding oversubscription.
Not expected for a PSU and in conditions where PSU stocks are not doing well.
Hearty congratulations to all who management the IPO & the proud RITES management and staff
3520 2018-06-22 15:03:41 I will. But not in the near time. Since it's out of stocks online 
3521 2018-06-22 15:03:40 Redwood has apparently been advising investors not to put their money into UK Stocks. Rees-Mogg too. What a complete crock of 
3522 2018-06-22 15:03:15 This is the problem with bullying the market, you may have messed up someone else in US to gain only on certain stocks to your benefit, but also could just be an angry person swayed by media or worried that Trump's position is anarchy for US and economy.
3523 2018-06-22 15:02:36 Also, when his tweets make the stock market drop, we need to find out if he is doing it purposefully and singularly to buy up stocks at lower prices!!!! Follow the money!!!Does he have a 'silent partner' managing this?
3524 2018-06-22 15:02:35 Gee. Did he call all his rich friends so they could short the auto stocks?

3526 2018-06-22 15:02:25 Hot off the press: Thegreat tip of the day is, to buy these stocks, like pharmaceuticals....
1) ACRX..feds approved meds
2) LNTH...imaging and pharma
3) ITEK...pharma meds
4) CHAT...research meds
5) AKTX...pharma 

These companies are making medicines to help improve our health
3527 2018-06-22 15:02:21 if you have big capital yes its worth day trading on high volume stocks for example $WEED, you could flip 200K$ for 5% gain in the blink of an eye. If you are day trading with small positions on penny stocks it's not worth the time IMO To each their own

3530 2018-06-22 15:01:33 Hey, #FoolOnTheHill , did you know that most foreign auto companies have plants here, that employ American workers? Many of those plants are in southern states, a strong part of your base. Or is your goal to tank stocks for those automakers? #DidYouThinkAmericansAreThatStupid ?

3560 2018-06-22 14:53:00 Human CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement production are responsible for the majority of the 40% increase in atmospheric CO2. Warming oceans could be a few percent. Emissions from plants are balanced by uptake. Don't confuse stocks with flows.
3561 2018-06-22 14:52:46 You are talking nonsense mate, up until January this year the EU allowed pulse fishing which decimates fish stocks.

3563 2018-06-22 14:52:12 Don't forget our boats are in their waters too. Grimsby in its heyday was probably the nadir of fish stocks. But why does this tiny sector get so much media and Leaver attention? It is miniscule compared to aviation and financial services which will be hard done by Brexit.
3564 2018-06-22 14:52:05 Before the end of almost every quarter profit taking insues in stocks with big gains. Happening on que.
3565 2018-06-22 14:51:54 Another way to look at it for sure. I trade weekly charts and hold the strongest stocks and dump the weakest. EFERT is one that I want to hang on to. Good dividends too.

3640 2018-06-22 14:25:24 So I been reading up about stocks and came across a good money making point. Since Canada just legalized weed the marijuana company that will be the big distributor for weed is gonna go public. Which means buy stock now while its low and hold it then ride the train up to wealth.
3641 2018-06-22 14:25:16 DJIA isn't even an indication of the industrial economy, many of the companies on it are service companies. It is supposed to be an indication of industrial stocks. It has evolved away from that.

3672 2018-06-22 14:14:11 While staying on top of the stocks in your portfolio is certainly important, it is also important to stay on top of the stocks in your universe. As time passes, prices and fundamentals change, which means the best opportunities may no longer be the ones in your portfolio.

3702 2018-06-22 14:01:00 Here's something weird.

Common stocks were largely ignored from the 1930's to 1970's.

3709 2018-06-22 13:59:53 London stocks had extended gains by midday on Friday, recovering from the previous session's losses as investors continued to digest a more hawkish than expected policy announcement from the Bank of England and kept an eye on developments from the Opec meeting in Vienna.

3711 2018-06-22 13:59:44 I understand and don't disagree. I and most of my investors are just too old now for the amount of risk in cult-of-personality stocks without reasonably strong/steady fundamentals/operations.

3798 2018-06-22 13:22:24 Not owning assets (property or stocks, 401k or otherwise) is the problem. The cause could be multiple things including (but not limited to) student debt. 1980 to today has seen meteoric rise of value for all assets so its sad that most have not found a way to take advantage.

3815 2018-06-22 13:15:22 Domestic benchmark equities ended higher today, on gains in bank, FMCG and auto stocks. Sentiment was buoyed after data showed that FPIs, who had been net sellers for the past several sessions, were back to buying mode on the domestic bourses on Thursday.
3816 2018-06-22 13:15:15 I believe Russell is adjusting their index today, done once a year, so trading volume is expected to be quite high today. Remember, buy low, sell high. Some stocks to consider are Canadian Pot companies...still a bargain in top ten stocks...
3817 2018-06-22 13:15:13 I realize that doesn't seem to matter much at the top of a 9-year bull market in stocks, but it will sound more clear eventually.
3818 2018-06-22 13:14:20 Perhaps, we should emulate Italy and hang fascist twats from petrol stations & lamp posts?

I guess the stocks are rather old-fashioned and outmoded.
3819 2018-06-22 13:14:19 That's the one thing lacking on a couple of stocks I'm invested in (#TLY and #SNG).....distinct lack of ramping, hype, or volume on either (there's only you and one other mentioning #TLY occasionally!). Think if the market wakes up to either they could move up significantly.

3852 2018-06-22 12:58:06 Owning stocks is not speculating; buying oil futures is speculating. Just as owning a house isn't being a real estate investor. The puck isn't going toward Crypto without a use case that isn't speculation.

3894 2018-06-22 12:26:27 Considering the empirical evidence of bitcoin's recent loose correlation with stocks, it should react positively as yields increase / people sell non-inflation protected bonds (e.g. non TIPS) for equities, commodities, and cash.

4033 2018-06-22 10:53:59 I guess the point of the original faulty graph was that regardless of the absolute returns of commodities vs. stocks, these assets should be uncorrelated (or negatively correlated) and mean reverting - thus there should be benefits to having them both and yearly rebalanced.

4068 2018-06-22 10:25:04 I disagree. Actually, higher priced stocks show similar patterns to small caps. Added advantage for absolute beginners is that they move a bit slower. Patterns work out smoother, because the higher float does not allow for really volatile "surprise" moves. Good learning ground.

4096 2018-06-22 10:09:05 You do realize that stocks are NEVER stable flat line, right? A 1% or 2% either way is just literally everyday business for every company that is publicly traded....news stations are f**ing clueless...they report on things unrelated to reality.

4. Have also tweeted if you can’t afford to take looses on specky stocks, stay far away. 

5.  Also I did and shared that I sold some 3m shares above 30c in AVZ and cleared that in cash 1m in my bank account.
4173 2018-06-22 09:02:34 1. Never guaranteed you (only family) & we are still picking up shares at these levels albeit smaller amounts. 

2. You haven’t sold, so no loss yet and if you ask me, if you can’t see the big picture fundementals, well then you shouldn’t be investing in specky stocks !

4266 2018-06-22 07:37:49 #EPS #Interpretation 
Standalone EPS may not be as effective.
But historical EPS gives insights into the company.
For investors, EPS is more important than PAT. Why?
PAT gives only a feel about the company.
PAT does not directly effect the market price of stocks.

4338 2018-06-22 06:39:22 I don't foresee a major correction but I do think the recent "Goldilocks" period is over & the next 12 months looks tricky. I have largely removed stocks that swing with Macro events & have given myself a large cash buffer. Comfortable with that.
4339 2018-06-22 06:38:35 The issues with bump stocks is that honestly pro-gun people could care less about them, but it’s a slippery slope when you start banning accessories with features that can be simulated with your finger and a belt loop on pants.
4340 2018-06-22 06:37:09 For an option writer (new or old) its always goo to re-visit two recent events - Aug 20-24 2015 and recent PSU bank rally. See what you could have done on these days to cover your positions on that day if you were trading those stocks. It will give you clarity abt options writing
4341 2018-06-22 06:37:01 This will move very fast in the near future. One of those stocks that gets little attention from the masses.

4348 2018-06-22 06:26:19 Even if you listened to main stream media you would not hear the truth ha. But I like lower taxes, lower unemployment and higher stocks.
4349 2018-06-22 06:26:13 BB You are anything but a plodder & with the spreads on your stocks you pretty much have to keep the faith. I don't see you having a problem.
4350 2018-06-22 06:23:58 MF can be right choice. However make sure that the Invested fund is beating the True Returns Index. #TRI index takes care of dividends declared by the stocks comprising the specific Index. How you are happy paying 1 to 2.5% TER as well!!!

4374 2018-06-22 06:04:36 Like getting rid of farmed salmon so @Greenpeace can support the decimation of wild stocks, all in the name of supporting the sport fishing industry? I’m ok with reasoned debate, but OMG you are just clueless. I’m assuming you’re a masochist.
4375 2018-06-22 06:04:16 Ha ha! So clever...loved the subtitles. .Well done son..Ma Stocks xx
4376 2018-06-22 06:01:49 Chase told me I had to talk to an advisor if I wanna do stocks through them. Fuck all that! 
4377 2018-06-22 06:01:48 Even with  a 10% move you will be in loss but can be recovered from if the position size is small like here. Buying far OTM reduces the potential of strangles in the long-term. Iron Condors are not great for volatile stocks unless you get a good deal.
4378 2018-06-22 06:01:40 No recession last 3 years, last time it takes about 1-2 years. But this isnt recession pun, foreign investors are bailing from emerging market’s banking stocks, yet, the bank still makes profit. This losses should be shortterm, once new gomen get the hang of stuff, should be okay
4379 2018-06-22 06:01:24 Indeed. Our stock exchange has been overvalued for years now. What is happening is the market naturally correcting itself.

This is the best time to buy those blue chip stocks - SMC, MER, JFC,etc

4382 2018-06-22 06:00:27 Returns will be more than 100X for many stocks.Besides no one has ever done such a Report.  you do wealth creation report but the period is limited & it doesn't show the return since listing date.@MrMotilalOswal @Raamdeo @AashishPS
4383 2018-06-22 05:58:23 Can you do a report showing returns generated by all stocks from their listing date till 30th June 2018.For some companies it will be from 1980 & for other since they got listed. It will  be a real eye opener for long term investing. @MrMotilalOswal @Raamdeo @AashishPS
4384 2018-06-22 05:58:23 Saudi Arabia won a keenly awaited upgrade to emerging-market status from MSCI Inc. overnight. The muted gains for stocks in Riyadh Thursday aren’t a shock to some market watchers who’ve seen this happen before.
4385 2018-06-22 05:57:27 No..This is 1 lot strategy precisely for the fear of volatile movement.
My stock portfolio is protected  with index puts.Options positions will take a hit and as I will not exit stocks, index  puts will serve as overall mkt protection. 
Stock specific black swans will hurt me

4412 2018-06-22 05:42:29 Agreed that it is not market of the past where the patent Cliff massively helped Indian generic makers. But there are opportunities elsewhere which are pretty lucrative. Rather than taking abroad sector call, it is better to hand pick stocks this time around.

4499 2018-06-22 04:16:38 Stocks?
4500 2018-06-22 04:16:24 Sorry, but I can't get excited when my stocks get taken out for "low" premiums. A 50% or 60% premium is low when you are selling at the bottom of the market. In my opinion, these (Silver Bull, Arizona Mining, and Dalradian) were deals in favor of the buyer and not shareholders.
4501 2018-06-22 04:16:17 Grabe. In just a matter of less than 6 months. Mas mabuti siguro bumili ng stocks around these times noh but nakakatakot nga lanh
4502 2018-06-22 04:14:34 all my stocks slide a combined average of -12.5 due to the greed of state governments. I haven't even looked at my Amazon stock yet.
4503 2018-06-22 04:13:50 Companies that create ankle bracelets that ICE use for people awaiting a hearing are making big bucks from the number of immigrants that have them (30,000 in 2016, 3x more than in 2014) and... geo group (major manufacturer) had its stocks go up 70% since trump’s election
4504 2018-06-22 04:12:07 Maybe Good thing for GE to have been replaced just in time.  GE is the last of the original DOW stocks back in 1898.  I don’t think trade wars or most any wars are good for anybody
4505 2018-06-22 04:11:49 Stocks plunged as Berkshire Hathaway unveiled a average beaded bracelet today.

4530 2018-06-22 03:52:54 Umm, you realize that you can simulate fully automatic fire by using your belt loop on your pants and your finger right? It’s physics. Same kind used in bump stocks. So really you just want every gun banned.

4542 2018-06-22 03:45:19 I asked my kids this question: "Would you rather invest in a fund that owns everything, or a diversified group  of stocks hand-selected that you know do well?" My 11-yr old son said "hand-selected group because you can watch them closely, you can lose a lot in the whole market.
4543 2018-06-22 03:44:06 I really don’t care
4544 2018-06-22 03:43:53 @Amit_Jeswani1  what if you had to bet entire net worth and you had to choose only 3 stocks. Would u still choose inflexion point and turnaround etc with 3rd rate management quality.
4545 2018-06-22 03:43:51 My rarely revealed market call: buy stocks because a lot of idiots will be buying stocks(most know no other way).   Sell out at the first sign of reversal.  It’s coming.  Soon.

4648 2018-06-22 02:33:20 @CitronResearch did you not learn a lesson from #greenlightcapital shorting their "basket of (hyped) tech #stocks "???   You should cover your $NFLX short before it hits $450, which I presume will be before earnings!  After earnings, your short will be a disaster !!    #Netflix
4649 2018-06-22 02:33:16 Stocks down again.  Down for the year now.  Looks like Trump tariffs and massive deficit may be starting to bring economy down.
4650 2018-06-22 02:32:58 Tomorrow is OPEC meeting. Very important for India. My hopes that Russia will be able to get more production than expected 

If you are an optimist a good day to take a call today on stocks. 

Ofcourse it is pure speculation for short term. Long term india best investment bet
4651 2018-06-22 02:32:56 Tbh it’s just trading mostly but I look for stocks that have patterns up consistent growth/decline and I buy when it hits the low point and sell when it hits the high one. I started with 100k and made almost 5k today doing that, but idk how sound it’d be in real life/with less $
4652 2018-06-22 02:32:23 Market's are see saw They take your stocks up and down as per the trend. you tend to repeat the same mistakes of buy high and sell low when you ignore valuations.
4653 2018-06-22 02:32:11 Ya but either way people are kind of looking at real estate wrong if they are happy or sad based on 12 months (or worse, last 4 months!!!) of price performance. Transactions costs are too high - these aren’t stocks. If you buy to live in it, time horizon should be longer than 4mo

まだ上がりそうだから小遣い抜こうと3,055円でインし、順調に上がって逆指入れようとしたところでインド人上司に話しかけられ、話し終わったら含み損。

4761 2018-06-22 01:16:02 Those with lots of paper money, stocks, bonds are better off for now. Wages are stagnant, gas prices, food & foreign items climbing. Don't know, maybe if you're a survivalist or very wealthy you're doing great.
4762 2018-06-22 01:13:45 If you have a financial planner, you can tell them not to invest in certain types of businesses. If it’s your company 401k, you have to look at all the stocks in the fund, but tell them you want a social stock option that does not invest in prisons.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
4764 2018-06-22 01:12:48 I'm looking for stocks that have the potential for larger than normal intraday range which can be traded profitably.  It could be up or down.
4765 2018-06-22 01:10:28 Sir please tell me any 2 stocks for monthly SIP it will be very helpful for me..thanks

4767 2018-06-22 01:09:57 @BigTymer37 I post often about stocks I'm bullish on here. Those are not on my list. I posted about $BILI recently alongside $IQ, to avoid.
4768 2018-06-22 01:09:43 IHS Markit: US$2.5B in cannabis stocks shorted as of Mon, highest level ever. $CGC $ACB.CA $APH.CA
4769 2018-06-22 01:08:03 When is this nightmare going to end? He lies about returning kidnapped kids to their parents
 He lies about banning bump stocks to Parkland survivors. The list of lies is endless. #Impeach45now
4770 2018-06-22 01:07:50 Stick with your stocks that are still in strong up trends.  Sell your laggards FAST, be much slower and methodical with your leaders.  Bottom line:  just be alert to any & all possibilities!  As Paul Tudor Jones always says:  "Play Great Defense"!
4771 2018-06-22 01:07:40 The #Hodeida port remains open and there are sufficient food stocks available to sustain 6 million Yemenis for the next month.

4772 2018-06-22 01:06:49 The stock market is not playing well right now for those who wants to sell their stocks already. But for the buyers, MAGDIWANG!!! Down! Down! Down!!! @iraltomera
4773 2018-06-22 01:06:20 And my man trust me you would know if me or one of my buddies was in either one of those...probably would have sent it 10 bags alone if I jumped into that micro float. 
4774 2018-06-22 01:03:56 #stocks The Dow has fallen 8% from its all-time high of 26,616, set back in January of this year. Time to get out of the market?
4775 2018-06-22 01:03:47 that is gold.
4776 2018-06-22 01:02:21 Blue-chip stocks are down for the last 8 days IN A ROW. The lowest since 1978 if it extends into tomorrow. I sincerely ask Trump's tariff supporters, "how can our country NOT fear a global trade war?" My directed question is not intended to taunt.
4777 2018-06-22 01:01:25 Let me answer my previous question that you have avoided. Stocks become overvalued and a correction occurs when economic indicators show a slowing in the economy - decreased sales, lower profits, diminished expectations.
4778 2018-06-22 01:01:06 Salted egg kayo jan.

4779 2018-06-22 00:59:50 I actually might move into weed stocks with some of my gains lol. I was promised volatility and lambos, not sideways and ramen.

4781 2018-06-22 00:58:55 Get your head out of the dust and stop being a fanboy. Crossplay will benefit everyone. Sony is losing a lot by not doing this. Have you seen their stocks drop? Along with bad press that Sony is being anti-consumer.
4782 2018-06-22 00:57:44 It always comes down to money with those maggots. People are actually getting rich warehousing children. DHS hands out fat juicy contracts to their friends and for-profit prison stocks are soaring. This is evil incarnate.
4783 2018-06-22 00:57:00 Private contractors with govt contracts to build prisons to hold children.
As the stock market wonders which stocks are a good investment.
4784 2018-06-22 00:56:05 Pot stocks cooling off? Have you looked at $cgc lately?

4790 2018-06-22 00:53:40 Well when people are being separated from their parents at the border, it’s a bigger story than the stocks

4792 2018-06-22 00:51:27 While stocks last: Used Baps!
I'm lovin' it!
4793 2018-06-22 00:48:43 @BigTymer37 $IQ I don't have a predetermined entry and there's other good stocks to trade. When one gets like this, not anxious. We'll see.
4794 2018-06-22 00:46:50 All great growth stocks are focused on terminating employees and shrinking the corporate footprint—agreed??
4795 2018-06-22 00:46:48 If all the mkt has is China then they are screwed. Plenty of carry in stocks there. Plenty of quality across the world.
4796 2018-06-22 00:46:20 Private prison stocks soared as soon as trump won.  Sad.
4797 2018-06-22 00:46:17 YES. Please fix this. Signed A nurse practitioner always trying to find alternative medicines instead of what I want or need to order.  Btw pur pharmacist are working so hard to keep up stocks. Much love
4798 2018-06-22 00:46:17 Yiu like the tax idea?  I like it too.  We should have a national sales tax on stocks that aren't tied to insurance or retirement funds.  The money could be used to expand medicare for all.

4800 2018-06-22 00:45:44 I told some guy earlier today ..once you get knifed and play less than an hour of college ball your stocks drop
4801 2018-06-22 00:45:05 Beware of companies trying to blame profit warnings on #trade tension.  Look below the surface. Often there are other issues which conveniently get lumped into the warning. For example, a competitor REAFFIRMED earnings guidance the same day. #investing #markets #stocks #equities
4802 2018-06-22 00:43:52 What ghouls buy stocks in this industry?!
4803 2018-06-22 00:43:39 #LIEGATE #WhereAreTheBabies You’re the one who is afraid of brown people. 
Speaking of backing down, why haven’t you banned bump stocks yet? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
4804 2018-06-22 00:42:40 this was my rant 2 weeks ago. private prison stocks went up week before #ZeroTolerancePolicy i need to look at $timeline. will try and gather and post.

4807 2018-06-22 00:41:53 I mean what exactly is she going to do when “the colonizer” she dresses down just tells her to go to hell?  Yell louder?  Jump up and down real fast in frustration like Yosemite Sam in those old Bugs Bunny cartoons?  These people are laughing stocks.
4808 2018-06-22 00:40:06 Yes....my stocks are tanking....thanks for that.
4809 2018-06-22 00:38:57 Maybe that’s because Japan lacks quality top-level managers in own stocks?
4810 2018-06-22 00:38:41 Long $VIX is a good idea in the last rally of a bull market. VIX tends to go up before the bull market tops (i.e. VIX and stocks go up together, with frequent VIX spikes).
4811 2018-06-22 00:38:35 Ah crap.  Lets go bank stocks
4812 2018-06-22 00:37:20 Shoulda never stayed! Lol folks gotta realize this shit like stocks and bonds. If they say yo stocks are up^ you gotta go right then. Cus they’ll change they mind quick
4813 2018-06-22 00:37:15 I want to see him in the stocks.

4816 2018-06-22 00:33:30 A poem should be flexible and humid
As an antiretroviral stocks,

Foolish
As devastating donkeys to the repository,

Funded as the parental template
Of ferocious ardors where the aviation has sparkled--

A poem should be circumstantial
As the recipe of climbers.
4817 2018-06-22 00:33:02 All the modified descendants proceeding from one or both might co-exist, and both rank as distinct parent-stocks?
4818 2018-06-22 00:32:46 Because stocks are fickle and E3 just happened. E3 is the time to sell stocks in game companies. Buy when rumors start, sell when announcements come. It's one reason the game industry has so many leaks, to create rumors and boost stock prices.  No bigger annoucements than E3.
4819 2018-06-22 00:32:05 Can you unban short barreled rifles and shotguns please? Give the left bump-stocks, it's more of a novelty item than anything functional. That is a trade that would satisfy both sides. One further, raise the age to 21 nationally, but pass National Concealed Carry reciprocity.
4820 2018-06-22 00:32:02 lol yes, boxes are just to get the idea, not exact!  but yes.  Idea is look for reversals on non-broken stocks in uptrend as indices hitting lowerBB

4826 2018-06-22 00:28:55 Anyone interesting make some large purchases in those stocks recently? Hmm?
4827 2018-06-22 00:28:12 Republicans are more concerned about banning refugees than they are about banning bump stocks, so don't BS us about security.  You blamed tariffs on Canada on "national security".  It's unwise to cry wolf and demonize a close, powerful ally with real predators in our world.
4828 2018-06-22 00:27:46 Put her in the stocks for oublic shaming. Good enough for her.
4829 2018-06-22 00:27:10 @coromining where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
4830 2018-06-22 00:25:15 Avoid stocks to trade with these points
So less volumes,big gap in bid and ask price,orders in smallest no like.2,1,3,5 means some men carry the stock healthy trades are always bigger in order and move fast #stockaytrading #LiveTrading #intraday
4831 2018-06-22 00:23:57 Futures open up mixed. Nothing to go on right now. Glad i didnt take any $VIX puts overnight. I try 1-2 trades max per day. Calculated. Thats how i keep my win % high.

4834 2018-06-22 00:22:15 Ano ang relasyon ng bagsak na stock prices sa mahal na mga bilihin? Kung ang kompaniya sa stock market ay may planong expansion para tugunan ang demand ng consumers, hindi na mangyayari kung lugi sa stocks at walang kapital. Mahal ang mga produkto nila dahil konti nga ang supply.
4835 2018-06-22 00:19:37 Stocks and earnings move in the same direction. It's not the magnitude that counts - it's the direction.

That's why valuations always rise during bull markets and valuations always fall during bear markets.

4838 2018-06-22 00:16:39 Lol. Yeah man. Hitting it big on my first option trade was the worst thing that could have happened. Made me super aggressive and my greed for more took over. I totally lacked discipline which I had trading stocks. Hard lesson.
4839 2018-06-22 00:16:09 You’re on the right path! Stocks are overvalued. Now keep going, use small words and limited grammar - why would stocks be overvalued?  I know it’s tough,  you can do it.
4840 2018-06-22 00:14:41 These stocks aren’t anyone’s scene...lol those with experience figured out these don’t work 10 years ago probably before you even knew what the OTC was .
4841 2018-06-22 00:14:01 Cash/valueables on hand as a back up, if EVERYTHING is dependent on internet accessibility you have nothing. Is electronic currency any safer than banks, stocks, etc?
4842 2018-06-22 00:13:30 “97% of Americans said we should ban bump stocks after Vegas, but no legislation ever appeared. There is a culture of corruption with our Washington politicians being bought and paid for by special interests like the NRA.” #NY19 #HVPride #QueerTheVote
4843 2018-06-22 00:13:20 Good stuff. Another take: corr bt tax receipts and stocks is spurious-business cycle drives both. If politics intervenes aggressively it may to boost wages/spending not corp earnings. Corp margins could be crushed yet the economy may survive if we throw money at the middle class.
4844 2018-06-22 00:13:08 @JohnPersinos1 #INVESTINGDAILY WITH JOHN PERSINOS HOW MUCH HAVE THEY PUT IN YOUR PORTFOLIO! MEDIAN/JOURNALIST JUST AS BAD WITH POLITICS AS STOCKS!

4847 2018-06-22 00:09:17 I have friends who run the half marathon, and who race on trails, who wear all manner of Hokas. See if you can find a store that stocks them, and make a field trip to try on all of them?
4848 2018-06-22 00:09:10 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
4849 2018-06-22 00:08:35 I wish I bought Capricio stocks
4850 2018-06-22 00:08:05 Did you ever read 'Alias,' the series 'Jessica Jones' was based on? It's all out in collections (and the library often stocks it!), and it's REALLY good.
4851 2018-06-22 00:07:41 Tokyo stocks rise further on
4852 2018-06-22 00:06:27 Asia stocks begin lower following the weak lead from Wall St where DJIA posted an 8th consecutive loss and longest losing streak in over a year; Japan underperforms in early trade on a firmer JPY; ASX 200 (-0.1%), Nikkei 225 (-1.1%), KOSPI (-0.5%)
4853 2018-06-22 00:06:11 You got it babe...Stocks are already in position. All bases are covered. We are going to Canada mid July.....It's even hotter out there 30deg+
4854 2018-06-22 00:05:49 Anong pakialam ko sa pagbagsak ng stock prices kung hindi naman ako investor o stock trader? Financial assets ang stocks ng mga kompaniya. Puwedeng gawing cash ang stocks para gamitin sa pagpapalago ng negosyo. Ang malagong negosyo ay nangangailangan ng maraming mga trabahante.
4855 2018-06-22 00:04:05 America: 
- it’s legal to own military weapons, bump stocks, and there’s a mass shooting every week
