5 2018-07-05 23:59:22 It is too early to tell but crude  may hit a cyclical high rather sooner than later. The oil complex may  have risen too fast and lost its strength consequently. The green trend  is not as sharp and steep as the blue trend.

11 2018-07-05 23:59:09 It’s supposed to treat acne and draw excess oil from your pores. It’s not something intended for daily use and you should definitely moisturize after using it because it’s pretty harsh. I had a mini size of this and it was miserable on my dry skin. What type of skin do you have?
12 2018-07-05 23:59:05 Yep. Destroying America's environment, one coal mine, oil plant, and natural gas disaster at a time. Great job. BTW, put the coal, petrol, and natural gas workers in geothermal, hydro-electric, or solar energy jobs. Then you keep jobs in America and help the environment.

17 2018-07-05 23:58:35 The same Venezuela which is trading control of its state-owned Citgo and other oil assets to Russian state oil corp Rosneft in exchange for the coverage of billions of debt?  What was Trump's plan?  Send our soldiers in with baseball bats and orders to break some legs?

36 2018-07-05 23:58:34 Interesting question! CBD is a THC antagonist, so you shouldn't be feeling stoned, even if the oil has a small bit of THC in it.
37 2018-07-05 23:58:32 Will the worldâ€™s oil supply continue to flow out of the Gulf?
38 2018-07-05 23:58:31 You should consider trading the oil reports that come out every week.
39 2018-07-05 23:58:29 A revitalized, streamline rail system could do away with long haul trucking leaving trucks to distribute from track to storage and distribution in a local/regional area.  But the corporate owned gov't continues to use oil guzzling trucks. It's good for Big Oil, not people.
40 2018-07-05 23:58:22 EVs still account for less than 2% of the auto fleet on the road. More impact on oil if all Municipals switch their buses to battery run. EVs however are seeing a growth in adoption

46 2018-07-05 23:57:43 What's irritating about the universe is that you know Pruitt will score a cushy job with the oil and gas industry and suffer no consequences for his corrupt behavior.

48 2018-07-05 23:57:42 Trump wants US military out of Syria, S. Korea and Europe, into Venezuela and Iran.

I.e. out of Russian clients and military rivals. Into Russia, Saudi, UAE’s oil rivals. Each act screwing American interests.

52 2018-07-05 23:56:59 Russian economy is so small and its relative population and domestic consumption is so small that it'd never need to import oil for its own domestic use, has centuries of oil reserve. Largest shale oil reserve 3 times Saudi reserve that doesn't have the technology to tap into

@USAEmbassyLibya
The Chargé d'Affaires a.i. Joshua Harris met with National Oil Corporation #NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and reaffirmed that #Libya-ns oil facilities belong to the Libyan people.
62 2018-07-05 23:55:56 Yeah, like they give a shit what you want. Their agreements are crafted to benefit *them*. If the US is producing as much oil as you claim, why aren't we processing it here (creating more jobs), and keeping the price down? Oh, right. Then the oil companies would lose profit.
63 2018-07-05 23:55:52 Without a mask as well. I'm impressed.
64 2018-07-05 23:55:36 My husband just said the oil companies will hire him immediately 
65 2018-07-05 23:55:29 I care about a planet for my grandchildren far more than I care about Big Oil.

75 2018-07-05 23:53:36 5/ This shift seems more comparable to Big Oil’s failed attempts to move toward fracking... tough to make it work b/c lower margins and less scalable than traditional
76 2018-07-05 23:53:34 Go to the grocery store i forgot the name of them but in the laundry section there’s little bottles of stain removers for specific stains and they WORK. Blood, makeup, oil, all that

81 2018-07-05 23:53:29 I'm curious what Big Oil company Pruitt will be working for, and if his wife will be working there, too?  Probably one he gave a waiver to!

86 2018-07-05 23:52:42 You are so illiterate to know that 1st Russia has the #3 largest oil reserve 2nd is a top exporter, not importer 3rd its own oil is still mostly untapped, 4th most of Russian oil projects are US & European explored
87 2018-07-05 23:52:22 my laptop is taking a million invested in coal, oil and buzzfeed are far better at reporting on the referendum than the bbc
88 2018-07-05 23:52:11 That is a short term, patch job. The facility is on its last legs. What do you do next decade when replacement becomes innevitable? 
Such a remedy reduces some contamination, still a carbon blowstack, which will have a price (increasing).
Add in whatever future $ of oil will be.

96 2018-07-05 23:50:56 Pruitt cancelled many safeguards to clean air and water, the Paris Accord, opened up Bear's Ears National Monument to drilling oil, stole land from the Indians for a pipeline and carelessly spent tax dollars for his own gain. YES, HE DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB!!! #ConmanDon #Resist
97 2018-07-05 23:50:54 PSA I looked up DIY exfoliants bc I ran out of my scrub today and I read to mix coconut oil and sugar together and BOI. MY SKIN IS SO SOFT
98 2018-07-05 23:50:51 Agreed, just like the oil companies should be charged with contributing to future human extinction.
99 2018-07-05 23:50:40 I guess that Trump thinks pumping oil & burning coal are ‘environmental’

101 2018-07-05 23:50:27 why you lie? now the grow is slowing even with the prices of oil going up! The debt is algo growing, and more expensive, but without new public infraestructure. We are in the same road that Argentina now.
102 2018-07-05 23:50:17 Aren’t high oil prices Putin’s directive for Trump? Anti OPEC tweets are all for show.

108 2018-07-05 23:49:39 You have to massage the oil into your cuticles properly or it won't
109 2018-07-05 23:49:38 @PeterZeihan  Absent Superpower question. If dollar diplomacy comes to Brazil and Petrobras does that ultimately rescue an otherwise struggling oil giant? I've interpreter for Petrobras often and their offshore drilling is mighty impressive but they have so many problems
110 2018-07-05 23:49:37 Do you have gas or electric? And also what type of oil you using?
111 2018-07-05 23:49:37 WTH? 1.5 million dollars...? Man, the price of snake oil has skyrocketed!
112 2018-07-05 23:49:35 Pruitt was destroying Obama initiatives and letting the EPA roll over to Big Oil and other companies who don't give a poop about the environment, also he was blindly loyal to Trump--so in Trump's eyes, he was doing an "outstanding" job.
113 2018-07-05 23:49:35 そしてこのタイミングでポアかよ！
114 2018-07-05 23:49:32 Um dummy! Your policy is what raised gas prices. You can't make up 2.4 million gallons of oil from Iran, with OPEC increasing production by 1 million gallons. But you're not good at math, are you!?! You're the who reneged on the Iran deal. Dummy!
115 2018-07-05 23:49:21 Are you retarded or just hyocrite ? That was 1969 when people still used wooden barges to carry oil on rivers, sewers drained refineries waste into river and there was no environmental standards. If happens today the company responsible would pay billions for cleanup
116 2018-07-05 23:49:15 Grateful for all you've done and continue to do! Question -"Olive oil, while certainly a healthful oil, is easily damaged by heat and is best reserved for drizzling cold over salad."  seeing conflicting studies on this.. can you point me to why you say "no" to evoo for cooking.

125 2018-07-05 23:48:03 There are better alternatives to their stinking oil, Mr. President. Energy from the Sun, Green Energy, it is amazing how many ways we could help save this planet by using hemp oil instead of their dirty oil. Please consider this and help save this planet. Praise YHWH and YESHUA.
126 2018-07-05 23:47:59 I had a dream ~8yrs ago. Jesus showed me an aerial view of Israel & a big earthquake which shifted plates to route a great reservoir of oil into Israel...literally diverting wealth there exclusively like never before. It made Israel the epicenter of wealth in that region

130 2018-07-05 23:47:23 The fact that there’s literally people who dislike the smell of Murphy oil soap is personally offensive to me
131 2018-07-05 23:47:22 Gas prices always go up this time of the year. Greedy oil company people going on vacation pay attention every spring it starts. So shut up about Trump it's not him.
132 2018-07-05 23:47:12 But its unrealistic to demand that a person withdraw from all oil related products and services because he takes care of the environment. Plus, this is a gradual process. Inevitably, we are involved with oil related products every day.
133 2018-07-05 23:47:00 There’s oil there.

144 2018-07-05 23:45:49 One oil company going down will see gains in Tesla... Tesla dropping in stocks you will see Gas Prices going to 4 dollars a gallon. Its really not rocket science its the ability to see threw the lies and deceit. I got a GED and I even know this shit.
145 2018-07-05 23:45:45 like the fashion industry is #2 in pollution only behind the OIL industry
146 2018-07-05 23:45:29 The one thing all those senators have in common is they are in states in which the Keystone Pipeline/other major oil pipelines pass through. Russia/mob wants oil monopoly.  Do the math.
147 2018-07-05 23:45:17 Had a nice day scalping oil futures.
148 2018-07-05 23:45:08 Two Thumbs Up.  Scott Pruitt was an oil company man with big behind closed door deals.  This is not only bad for the environment, but bad for business.  The rest of the world is going green.  How long will it now take the U.S. to catch up with the renewable energy business boom?

150 2018-07-05 23:45:06 Mr. Oil is leaving but now we have Mr. Coal.
151 2018-07-05 23:44:59 Just wait a few months. All those loyal trump cultist will finally get their just rewards. They won’t have unions, affordable health care, food, gas, heating oil, steel, aluminum! It will all be too expensive to buy!  I hope they love what they created!
152 2018-07-05 23:44:57 Surprise today was unexpected, Saudi's saying delaying Aramco IPO. Oil pulled down to pivot 73 from 74.50, inv rpt negative 69 below, wider range 69 to 77, Trump wants down, others want up, usually sells off into Labor Day, sidelines okay til more info.

155 2018-07-05 23:44:40 Global oil demand in 1960 was only 20 million barrels a day. It is now 100 million barrels a day. When one considers that plus the fact that global oil decline rates are getting steeper & the majority of the world's Super Giant fields are 50 to 80 years old @Go_Rozen @LukeGromen
156 2018-07-05 23:44:40 Simplifying oil markets to OPEC is absurd. Simplifying gasoline markets to OPEC is fraudulently ignorant.
157 2018-07-05 23:44:39 Well, we're not getting it. No 2 was an oil and gas lobbyist

Pake oil based. Milk cleanser. Fw.
159 2018-07-05 23:44:25 Well use rosehip oil. They use that on surgical scars too. Even Robs brother was told to use it after surgery on his varicose veins. It is ace on wrinkles too. Antiaging.
160 2018-07-05 23:44:24 I can see foreplay taking awhile especially if ya’ll doing the romantic stuff w/ edible massage oil & handcuffs but sex, I’m not tryna fuck all night sorry.
161 2018-07-05 23:43:55 I don’t know how you managed to make the Oil Ocean Zone worse, but the second part of the level with the fire that takes over accomplishes that.
162 2018-07-05 23:43:52 .. no worry about big oil.. we’re getting a guy serving coal...
163 2018-07-05 23:43:45 Ounces of hair oil used every week?
164 2018-07-05 23:43:44 It seems your measure of a healthy environment is sorely lacking when it comes to the health of Americans, damage to drinking water and, oh, oil spills!
165 2018-07-05 23:43:41 It's not "oil buddies" you morons, creating economic opportunity in frozen wasteland very few humans would dare to visit otherwise w/the least impact on wildlife compare to dense wildlife population places like Pennsylvania or Oklahoma. It's for economic & strategic interests
166 2018-07-05 23:43:41 Poor Great Falls. Has he planned to drain your falls yet so someone can drill for oil there or is that a future plan.

173 2018-07-05 23:42:34 He doesn’t seem to know very much at all. He thinks oil=rich. No comprehension whatsoever of basic profit and loss. I’m guessing he can’t even use simple arithmetic.
174 2018-07-05 23:42:31 Was hoping Oil would sign him, wasn't gonna happen after rieder and brodziak signings but at 650K that's a damn cheap risk.

179 2018-07-05 23:42:11 The current government is aligned with foreign interest to harm Canadian oil industry for different reasons but with the same result. Historically this is quite unusual situation, that will be corrected in 2019 election.

194 2018-07-05 23:40:21 When there's oil involved, it gets questionable here. We rarely do 2 or more pans though, so it's never out of control. The husband bought a sous vide, which also cut back on the smoke...until he sears the meat.
195 2018-07-05 23:40:09 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!

206 2018-07-05 23:39:11 Illegal aliens are abused as a cheap labor source by construction companies, large contractors that do excavation and dirt work, and the oil industry, for starters.

People act like picking fruit is all that is sacrificed by allowing this, which is an absoulte fallacy.

211 2018-07-05 23:38:54 Nobody "sells" the wildlife refuge to oil and gas, the government sells mineral rights and taxes them, the EPA has very strict regulations on protecting the environment and only 5 acres per 1000s of acres needed for horizontal drilling sites. Wildlife enjoys the rest.
212 2018-07-05 23:38:45 If Trump is true to form he’ll replace Pruitt with someone even worse and more antithetical to EPA’s mission. My money is on a leaky oil barrel.

217 2018-07-05 23:37:25 Dude, seriously. Tweeting and bitching about OPEC solves nothing. You have to actually “work” with OPEC leaders & reach a compromise on increasing oil production. 

Also, the Iran Deal you illegally backed out of took a few million barrels a day off the market. Genius move, fool.

234 2018-07-05 23:35:12 Did you go to fill up your tank today? Did you notice that gas prices have suddenly spiked like 50 cents/gallon? You want to know why? 

Well, you can thank Trump's senseless Iran policy for this one. It's helping drive up oil prices - and this is just the beginning... :(

251 2018-07-05 23:32:53 I don't do sweet potatoes too often. Really only like them in fry form (I bake them at least). Mainly red potatoes tossed with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning and roasted in the oven.
252 2018-07-05 23:32:46 Good morning.turn on the (oil) heater

253 2018-07-05 23:32:27 You can put “marvel mystery oil” in the cylinder through the spark plug hole. Then put it in the highest gear and rock it back and forth. That could get it un-stuck
254 2018-07-05 23:32:16 Don't forget we buy oil from Canada so no more supporting the beaver population and igloo makers!

283 2018-07-05 23:28:05 Trump PROMISED to get RID of Lobbyist & then he hired a Guy who has been one of the Biggest Coal/Oil/Chemical Lobbyist in the WORLD like Andrew Wheeler?Wants u to believe he interested in saving clean air/Clean water for your Grand kids/Great Grand kids?Are u people that stupid?
284 2018-07-05 23:27:58 So I get an oil change, and then my check engine light comes on after? I don’t think that’s supposed to happen
285 2018-07-05 23:27:54 And the carbon fiber they are made from comes from oil. The eco-geeks probably think the bearings in the turbines are lubticated with eco-friendly peanut butter
286 2018-07-05 23:27:45 I cleaned up 5 gallons worth of coconut oil today....but I have Rainer cherries now so I’m good 
287 2018-07-05 23:27:35 For this crepe, it was just a thin layer of @MuscleEgg seasonal Pumpkin Spice egg whites in coconut oil spray. For the filling, 1/2 cup fat free cottage cheese, 2 tbs Oikos Triple Zero Vanilla Greek yogurt and a tsp of the preserves. It should easily fill 2-3 crepes.
288 2018-07-05 23:27:19 That’s what he want so all his buddy’s get richer he don’t buy oil.
289 2018-07-05 23:26:52 They were awesome.. olive oil.. salt pepper garlic powder.. 350 oven 25 mins...
290 2018-07-05 23:26:51 UPS delivered my Becca Cosmetics package to the wrong address and I JUST WANT MY @chrissyteigen  GLOW OIL AND I WANT IT NOOWWW 
291 2018-07-05 23:26:41 I ate a spoonful of coconut oil once and that shit lubed me up
292 2018-07-05 23:26:33 And so do I, none of them have been offered jobs back in the oil industry.
293 2018-07-05 23:26:32 It's the new oil pricing strategy. Instead of letting the price eke up a penny at a time, crank it up 10 cents a litre until people start screaming, then pull it down 7 cents a litre & pretend it's "market forces".
294 2018-07-05 23:26:30 After Wheeler leaves, totally looking forward to a golem made of coal as EPA director and a sentient oil slick as his deputy
295 2018-07-05 23:26:27 @realDonaldTrump  shocking when most young so called greeners shop n huge malls, use devices created/maintained by huge amounts of oil/ coal, support Hollywood films created by huge amounts of oil/coal, attend theaters/concerts/schools ran on oil/coal etc  and r not thankful
296 2018-07-05 23:26:17 Amazing number of hits against one company - who is paying - big oil?
297 2018-07-05 23:26:03 My fav thing ever to put in my hair is peppermint oil lol it feels so good
298 2018-07-05 23:25:48 How long until Scott Pruitt has a well paying job with some oil or chemical company?
299 2018-07-05 23:25:46 Hot mechanic boys working on my car make me be like “ya’ll can change my oil a n y t i m e”
300 2018-07-05 23:25:46 Have you looked into using cannabis oil?  I don't know if it's legal in your state, I've heard it's helped many people.  Praying for you sweetheart. 
301 2018-07-05 23:25:42 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
302 2018-07-05 23:25:41 Doesn’t he know that it is only the tax revenue on oil that counts? (I’m blocked)
303 2018-07-05 23:25:16 gunakan pelembut kulit sepatu/mink oil. Minyak ini hanya digunakan pada sepatu futsal berbahan kulit untuk menjaga warna dan kondisi kulit.
304 2018-07-05 23:25:14 Sweet scent of rain with last of CBD oil for my dog to smooth anxiety of thunderous noise, but a year it has not been since we in the City Different had a downpour.
305 2018-07-05 23:25:12 this what dove soap, aveeno moisturizer, coconut oil, sunlight, and 8 bottles of water a day do to you 
306 2018-07-05 23:25:12 That's nothing. I can't eat mayonnaise or any type of creamy dressing. I hate most bread that hasn't hasn't been toasted in some capacity. I'm weird about my olive oil - most is cheap garbage.
307 2018-07-05 23:25:10 Difficult to compare countries eg Norway, becoming more right wing, less people than London, economy oil minerals fish cf our services, higher taxes on goods higher health care costs, many private industries.
308 2018-07-05 23:25:06 Have you considered strategies other than bluster to reduce oil prices? How about raising fuel economy standards in the US? How about rejoining the Iran deal and allow them to sell to the US?
309 2018-07-05 23:25:04 Trump also continues to sell America out to Putin like we are cheap pork bellies on the market to the highest bidder to line his pockets as he continues to fleece America on the taxpayer's dime! Traitorous, snake oil con-Trump! Biggest "art of his deal" ever! Trump's fleecing USA
310 2018-07-05 23:24:59 cerahin muka doang itu mah coba kamu pake bio oil deh
311 2018-07-05 23:24:58 I’m in need of a Hennessy and baby oil type of night 
312 2018-07-05 23:24:57 The Iranians will make a huge mistake if they try to block oil shipments from the Persian Gulf. It will give an excuse for USA to launch a massive strike against Iran for which they have been itching for a long time.
313 2018-07-05 23:24:49 my dad is in the 20th minute of a story about his experience calling and re-calling some place a bunch of times b/c he thought he was due a free oil change
314 2018-07-05 23:24:46 Hello Healing Community! 
I am using the most amazing hemp oil that is loaded with phyto CannaBinoid Diols! It helps with stress, sleep, aches and so much more! I am  LOVING it!!!
315 2018-07-05 23:24:41 I had the exact opposite experience at my oil change today. I went in totally expecting them to recommend new tires because it is honestly about that time. But no, tires were good they said so out I went with just the oil change and my free car wash.
316 2018-07-05 23:24:39 I don't know how, but I fucked up my oil... Fuck.
317 2018-07-05 23:24:32 Shea moisture beard wash, detangler, and oil
318 2018-07-05 23:24:30 Kayaknya engga begitu nder. Coba pake bio oil atau dermatix gitu
319 2018-07-05 23:24:28 The water filled cave area solid HDPE pipes can be used so boys can use as tunnel..I can help to get pipes..this is used in oil and gas industry..joint can be flexible
320 2018-07-05 23:24:17 Pray for no oil spills
321 2018-07-05 23:24:05 Add one teaspoons of olive oil then whisk briskly.
322 2018-07-05 23:23:58 They are only worried about Alberta Oil all the rest of their environmental catastrophes don’t count
323 2018-07-05 23:23:54 Wait, so, Iran, which is the single greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world, says that if they aren't allowed to export their oil, because of sanctions, no other country in the region will, either? They're gonna block the passage? Well, you deserve what you're gonna get then.
324 2018-07-05 23:23:53 My sister & her wife, who has celiac disease, do gluten free paleo w/ stuff like coconut oil, duckfat . . . lard. 

My digestion gets queasy! But fish + fresh veggies is perfect for me. Stir fry w/ cauliflower rice, pasta primavera with zucchini noodles, poke', pho. Like that.
325 2018-07-05 23:23:17 Cooked!....all my oil waiting in that long ass queue!
326 2018-07-05 23:23:12 I really picked basically the best possible time to get back into the oil industry. #Stampede2018 #everypartyever
327 2018-07-05 23:23:06 Jobs in the oil industry are not up, they are down massively from 3-4 years back.
328 2018-07-05 23:23:00 Yes!  It's time to end the end the opposition to some of the most responsible development and delivery of oil in the world.  We should not have to lower our standards and import large quantities of foreign oil to fill our energy needs.
329 2018-07-05 23:22:55 Oil spill represents his best buddies.
330 2018-07-05 23:22:55 OIL commodities markets and pricing as sensitive to price fixing as FX AND Interest rates . FX /LIBOR fixing was investigated by US and resulted in massive fines . It’s time for the US to start investigating the OIL price rigging done blatantly by countries and speculators now.
331 2018-07-05 23:22:41  good one! downgraded to coal  from oil 
332 2018-07-05 23:22:32 Its channeling nature energy. You have to balance your physical and spiritual energies or else it won’t work of too much can cause you to turn full road due to the overpowering nature energy. They used road oil to help him. I know how tf it goes I’ve watched it three times.

I'm sure he's equally happy making it easier and cheaper to pollute with both.

340 2018-07-05 23:21:40 Just umm.. Sprinkle likkle coconut oil
341 2018-07-05 23:21:36 God put large oil reserves in the Middle East for "the End Times." Never mind that much of that eschatology is less than 200 years old.

344 2018-07-05 23:21:21 @ChisholmHolland @ColbyJPowell   Don’t listen to them Colby.  Olive oil covered with some sea salt.  Crisps up nicely.
345 2018-07-05 23:21:20 So I’d been suffering from a serious case of tender scalp. Then I noticed that whenever my mum anointed my head with olive oil the tenderness ceased. So I bought olive oil infused with lemon and jojoba as a hot oil treatment before shampoo and my scalp has felt normal. 
346 2018-07-05 23:21:14 fish oil x k2
347 2018-07-05 23:21:10 All Venezuela did was nationalize their oil industry, the majority of their industry is still privately owned. Even if it wasn't, that's not what socialism is. "Full embrace" my ass.
348 2018-07-05 23:20:59 My friend's dad worked there, and while I don't have visual proof of what was housed in well itself, my friend's dad was a gas and oil guy, and not an ice cream man, sadly. We were not a town known for our ice cream... so there's that.
349 2018-07-05 23:20:47 @jimcramer I want to learn more about trading Gold and Oil stocks. What books and/or online videos would you suggest? I have been trading for 10 years now, but I can't seem to figure out Gold & Oil. PLEASE HELP! @MadMoneyOnCNBC
350 2018-07-05 23:20:30 I’m with you, but how is this different than “No one should read baseball stats except professional scouts.” Some of us like to talk about this stuff, others consumer confidence, interest rates, oil prices, etc.
351 2018-07-05 23:20:29 You sat down to dinner with Putin as RU launched savage attacks on 5 cities in Crimea, against all international law, making it appear usa supports lawlessness! Lying traitor, u just got played. Something to do with oil pipeline, to be sure. #KremlinCaucus
352 2018-07-05 23:20:16 Why is that codiene works some mornings as an effective painkiller without the incapacitating drowsiness, then another day it'll make it hard as fuck to stay awake, and another day it does nothing? How the fuck is this opiate more beneficial than CBD oil?
353 2018-07-05 23:20:07 It was called “land of the Czars”. I think the Crimea uproar is more over its strategic position. Got ports, Oil pipelines, etc.....
354 2018-07-05 23:20:01 Agreed, nor should people who are in the pockets of oil companies be allowed to run the Environmental Protection Agency.  Good riddance to this piece of shit.
355 2018-07-05 23:19:57 @NicolleDWallace I would love to see a list of the actions Pruitt has taken to help oil, gas and coal while denying climate change and destoying the agency that is supposed to protect the environment.  More important than ethics
356 2018-07-05 23:19:45 I made a lotion that was one part almond oil, one part shea butter, and two parts raw cocoa butter, & long story short I smell like a chocolate bar
357 2018-07-05 23:19:38 No I mean I use my inhalers too the brown and blue one but i was talking about an oil that helps  with asthma
358 2018-07-05 23:19:24 半botだから、話しかけてね＼(^o^)／基本リプは返します＼(^o^)／オイルトークしようね＼(^o^)／
359 2018-07-05 23:19:22 Pretty simple: 2 cups of Coconut flour, 1/4 cup of coconut oil, 1/4 of Psyllium Husk Powder, and 4 eggs & a dash of baking soda.
360 2018-07-05 23:19:02 Acne more often affects skin with a greater number of oil glands; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back.
361 2018-07-05 23:18:58 How about the captain of the Exxon Valdez?  HE knew how to distribute oil.
362 2018-07-05 23:18:56 I’m so sweaty I feel like I’m covered in oil to slip around the place
363 2018-07-05 23:18:54 Because in addition to being a climate change denier in the pockets of big oil, coal, and the Russians, he was personally corrupt and criminal as hell. Maybe this time we’ll get a climate change denier in the pockets of big oil who isn’t trying to rob us blind at the same time
364 2018-07-05 23:18:54 Something is so negative in the growth of #Brent oil ... Yes, these are my calculations and the growth of bearish positions. #CME #trading
365 2018-07-05 23:18:45 Follow the Big Oil money!  Duh!
366 2018-07-05 23:18:41 Bwahahaha the price in Metro Van fluctuates $.10/ltr from morning to night, from average week to long weekend. It also dropped the same amount practically overnight when the Liberals announced forking over $4.5 billion to Kinder Morgan. Oil has risen $10 per barrel yet no change.
367 2018-07-05 23:18:28 Now how many of u are Dumb enough to Praise trump for putting a Oil&Chemical Lobbyist as head of the EPA? Man talking about building a Swamp! He said he was getting Rid of Lobbyist when he Campaigned! Now he's hiring them to run our Government!
368 2018-07-05 23:18:24 Actually it’s the rich that subsidize the development of the Model S etc. Once enough cars are produced and manufacturing costs come down, then mass market cars can be produced, i.e $35K Model 3.  Big Oil is massively subsidized so you better come up with another argument.
369 2018-07-05 23:18:19 Agreed. 45-50 is where I see him and would be happy
370 2018-07-05 23:18:19 I feel like Life could at least use some lube when she fucks me over and over again....ffs, grab some coconut oil every now and again.

What viscosity oil would you recommend in my ‘05 Element w/183k? I live in moderate weather (Portland, Or). Never very hot or very cold.

376 2018-07-05 23:17:26 #OIL ($USO) Update 
We are heavy short in a LT view. ST view we layered in shorts in $USO on 6/27 at the close and again on 6/29. 

Key levels are:
L1: sustained break of $14.65 
L2: break and close below $14.24 If this break look out below 

Remaining short under $15.06

383 2018-07-05 23:17:07 Wait what? I read somewhere yesterday that oil prices were going up to $100. I’m so confused! #economists
384 2018-07-05 23:16:57 Can someone tell me how the Trump tax cut has helped them (outside of a small bump in pay)? I’m honestly asking. I’ve seen no benefit. Oil prices are up, which cancels that small savings.
385 2018-07-05 23:16:57 Fed/State govts. now 19% of gas price!  Oil price only 50%.  Outrageous!

392 2018-07-05 23:15:52 All hydrocarbons are toxic, corrosive and combustible. A mixture of condensate and heavy oil, “or dilbit” is no different. I didn’t realize there were such things as “realist” economists. Or are those just the people that say the things that fit your narrative?
393 2018-07-05 23:15:50 Can’t blame rUK believing Scots r scrounges. Even Scots believed this.
Suck Scotland’s resources south, including cannon fodder, & convince it, it has nothing to offer. Build M25 and channel tunnel from oil and everyone still believe Scots r scrounges

414 2018-07-05 23:13:15 Scott Pruitt was a disaster for the environment and the EPA. He is a selfish chiseler and a Big Oil flunky. He sucked as a leader and finally got fragged. Glad he's gone. But unfortunately for FL, Marco Rubio is still our US Senator.
415 2018-07-05 23:13:13 1. I say Jensen’s with him (could be any body of water really); 2. Suntan oil is hard to grab hold of, but prob makes for pretty good lube...
416 2018-07-05 23:13:11 Possibly. Or it might have to do with the complete politicization of war and nation building, selling it in a manner that can't possibly match reality. Telling the country how quick and easy it'll all be, while falsely claiming the county's oil will pay for it all, doomed it.
417 2018-07-05 23:12:58 He hired security, why would a Trump cabinet need security?
I judge by results. No match for @GinaEPA and #AnimasRiver, caused the spill, dodged cleanup, dozens other toxic rail spills, BP oil disaster.

424 2018-07-05 23:12:24 You sound so whiny - is this how you think you can control the world oil price
425 2018-07-05 23:12:20 ありがとサン
426 2018-07-05 23:12:18 Went to Jiffy Lube for an oil change on 6/12/18 paid $178.53 in sunrise fl, on June 29th the car shut off because no oil. There is no oil leak. No response from corporate. This will not go under the rug! Never go here
427 2018-07-05 23:12:11 1/3 of the cost per 1 liter goes to taxes, so the oil companies only get 33% more than the government. Oil companies have the cost of all infrastructures from exploration to shipping and refining. Government has 0 RISK. So it is the governments greed that drives the prices also.
428 2018-07-05 23:12:07 A week after Capital Gazette shootings and @realDonaldTrump resumes bashing the press and media.  Sad he has no empathy.  Spewing lies like a snake oil salesman. #PutinsPuppet @foxandfriends
429 2018-07-05 23:12:05 Big tweet day--in the middle of all of these tweets, I'm excited that my 6-month old hybrid/battery car is now up to 94 mpg average. I'm shooting for 100 mpg so I will match that car in the Shell Oil TV commercial in the 1960s. (Remember that?) #FordFusionEnergi #DriveGreen
430 2018-07-05 23:12:05 YES! 

“Pruitt was an anti-science climate change denier and did everything he could to roll back regulations at the behest of oil and coal lobbyists, all but ensuring harm to our air and waterways.”

433 2018-07-05 23:11:54 AWESOME!! You can put even more PRESSURE on them, by letting me develop and sell my direct water burning, HYDROGEN BURNING TURBINE!!!! NO MORE BURNING GAS, NO OIL REFINERIES, NO OIL KINGS. give me a shot, what have you got to lose? keep them off my back!!!!

435 2018-07-05 23:11:52 Anytime Trump says something like this that I know nothing about I wonder if there is a speck of truth to it. This could be made up just to slam Germany and NATO. Did Germany actually make a deal involving oil and gas with Russia?
436 2018-07-05 23:11:46 Brown sugar & coconut oil 
437 2018-07-05 23:11:38 coconut oil is solving all my problems and oh boy i sound like both sj and harley
438 2018-07-05 23:11:36 Lol, my wife makes some cubed up Sweet Potatoes roasted in the oven, with seasoning and a little olive oil, way better than any French fry, in my opinion.
439 2018-07-05 23:11:33 What progress has been made to keep water and air clean?  What progress in protecting natural resources and beauty for our children.  Sorry, Fat Nixon I guess you mean great progress for Oil and Coal companies and Koch brothers.
440 2018-07-05 23:11:33 Kale
Red pepper
Half avocado
Teaspoon coconut oil
(Lactofree) Milk / other liquid you like!
(+Vegan protein powder for me)

Avocado is optional, but if adding protein powder it helps bind things together.
441 2018-07-05 23:11:32 I didn't realize they had passed a law permitting cbd oil. Nice.

Geez, Georgia is lagging behind.
442 2018-07-05 23:11:31 There was this giant oil tank on the outskirts of my town. I was CONVINCED that this was where they housed the big buckets of ice cream before they went to grocery store. I was very sad to learn it was refined gasoline, and you know, not ice cream.
443 2018-07-05 23:11:24 #Pruitt's replacement is a former oil & gas lobbyist. No surprise there.  It'll be interesting to see, in what might be a very short tenure, how much he'll be able to re-direct into his bank account. Also what amenities he'll decorate his office with. Ideas? Hot tub? Van Gogh?
444 2018-07-05 23:11:17 He seems to have never gotten a copy of the job description. He wasn’t there to serve Trump but the American people in as much as an anti-science, anti-environment, coal, oil and gas addict could do as head of EPA.

446 2018-07-05 23:11:02 A lot of psuedo science out there.. theres a lot more to the EPA then gas and oil their tenticals reach to your back yard. Rolling back regulations is what we wanted, I have suffered from these regulations.
447 2018-07-05 23:10:50 So, who wants to help me sew up a bunch of oil tower costumes to camouflage our Nat'l Parks before Wheeler starts on Monday??

450 2018-07-05 23:10:42 USA must protect Strait of Hormuz from Iran threatening for  not allowing Oil crude tankers to pass through Strait . It is time to dispatch the more military fleets there .  Iranian aggression must be stopped before Causing a crisis in the delivery of oil  globally.

454 2018-07-05 23:10:34 Whats truly stupid is how people think we don't need oil but yet we use oil for nearly everything on the planet.

458 2018-07-05 23:10:10 So we move from Oil and Gas Industry Surrogate now to Coal Industry??  Climate Change deniers  at the front of the line.  Pathetic

460 2018-07-05 23:09:39 they have a surplus, they will implement sanctions until their oil is sold at exorbitant prices due to demand created by the blockage and Iran's non-supply. When they made enough profits and their stockpile is depleted, they will lift sanctions and the cycle shall continue.
461 2018-07-05 23:09:29 Send ICE into the kitchen
462 2018-07-05 23:09:27 So now I have to try peppermint oil and an antacid to hopefully help this bloating that I still don’t know the cause of 
463 2018-07-05 23:09:24 oh dear, your education is deplorable, just deplorable. Today's Republican Party, would never have elected Abraham Lincoln, in fact, you'd be firmly against Abraham Lincoln. You're now the Party of Trump, America's Snake Oil Salesmen.
464 2018-07-05 23:09:20 Kalo untuk bekas yang udah gaada jerawat aktifnya, discrub aja. Kalo misalnya masih ada jerawat aktif, pake face oil
465 2018-07-05 23:09:11 There is one glaring and obvious flaw in your attempt to show that solar is as dangerous as oil: practices can be put into place to deal with much of the neg solar effects. The same is simply not true when it comes to fossil fuels. So there is that.
466 2018-07-05 23:09:08 Truth may be stretched, but cannot be broken, and always gets above falsehood, as does oil above water.

467 2018-07-05 23:09:00 #CRYBABYTRUMP are you afraid of the big bad OPEC?  You’re too stupid to understand that your policies are leading to higher oil prices. #MoronInChief
468 2018-07-05 23:08:53 Rising oil prices will bolster the Feds coffers. It doesn't mean the average Canadian will benefit.  However,  it could embolden Trudeau to take on Trump.  That won't be a good thing.  It will only extend the trade war, that Canada can not win.  Collateral damage is the economy.
469 2018-07-05 23:08:38 Me too, after all the olive oil...
470 2018-07-05 23:08:34 To the Slim thick dreadhead that got the whole store smellin like baby oil... I love you.
471 2018-07-05 23:08:31 Ironic that many humans don't want palm oil, companies do because it's cheap. If humans knew how bad it is for them and how companies have been sneaking it into practically everything we eat, maybe this awful deforestation could be halted
472 2018-07-05 23:08:28 Ask your buddies in the oil industry to cut down on the greed.... Billions in profit EVERY MONTH is the problem.  And you.
473 2018-07-05 23:08:25  I literally spent a good $50 on all that and like $30 to get my oil changed  treating yourself is essential though so...no regrets 
474 2018-07-05 23:08:22 Best of luck to the fullest
475 2018-07-05 23:08:19 Caucasians are strange beings, I'm yet to verify if they reaaaallly apart of God's ppl. 
Every body else is onli racist cause they too have felt Caucasian oppression. Even within Asian communities there's division. Latin America, and now they finna get the oil in the middle east.
476 2018-07-05 23:08:15 Jose Francisco Lopez Centeno, the president of a Nicaraguan state-owned oil company, was accused of stealing millions of dollars and using his position to win government contracts for companies owned by his family.

484 2018-07-05 23:07:51 why I thought I could sunbathe today with baby oil and no factor is beyond me, I have the skin of a ginger and now I feel like I’ve been set alight 
485 2018-07-05 23:07:50 Big oil hasn’t done anything yet if they did gas would be 5 bucks a litre in Vancouver
486 2018-07-05 23:07:41 And he is the only one with two rings and more wins than any of them.. Nice try Eli we are not buying the snake oil!!!
487 2018-07-05 23:07:39 Yes, he valiantly persevered in the face of . . . what was it?  13 investigations into his corruption?  But he never lost faith that he would make a bundle off this gig, help out his oil and coal industry buddies, and never face any consequences.  How very fucking heroic.

490 2018-07-05 23:07:19 What else would one expect from somebody who never wrote anything himself but instead cut and paste writings of the oil industry?
491 2018-07-05 23:07:13 Looking at the sky thru smog and oil slicks and trash in the water.  Yeah, very bright.
492 2018-07-05 23:07:11 All that and you have to murmur sweet nothings hahahaha...okay no I tear it up REAL small, nothing worse than a big chunk of kale. Then I toss a few sprinkles of oil on it, and I just...massage it. For a while.
493 2018-07-05 23:07:05 Tell them massive Electronic Propulsion Cycles will be instituted quickly to make oil worthless. Water car plans being released will also enter the market.  hmmmmm

496 2018-07-05 23:06:52 He'll get his. Wife too. Coal & oil will make sure their boy lands in a pile of cash.
497 2018-07-05 23:06:51 I didnt see any changes in my eye bag but if you want to lighten the area mix almond oil with vitamin e oil everyday before you go tp bed and you'll see changes after a month

506 2018-07-05 23:05:40 Thank you Mr. President we need lower gas prices. All the President’s before you wasted billions of dollars liberating other countries that had lots of oil and we got zip for our blood sweat and tears. Gas should be 199. A gallon max for every taxpayers invyne US. Thanks again.

514 2018-07-05 23:05:17 Obama's predecessor deliberately and knowingly lied to the US in order to manufacture a holy war against brown people (and to get lots of oil money).  We don't need to 'demonize' them.  They do a fine job of making themselves into villains without our help.

519 2018-07-05 23:04:35 Wait hold up right now trump forced 30% tariffs on solar power to help suppress its profitability against oil (now less than a barrels cost for equal energy) and koch bros r destroying all forms of public transit proposals 2 continue forcing us to buy oil. Choose ur words better.
520 2018-07-05 23:04:20 You tried tea trea oil or apple cider vinegar
521 2018-07-05 23:04:12 I got it! He’s putting the oil on them and prepping for the picture and Jensen is just watching him and giving him his “seriously?” look. Or Jensen’s facepalming. Something along those lines.
522 2018-07-05 23:04:10 Yes, and you ARE do will fully blind  what in Sam hell do the Clinton's have to do with any of this, sweetheart? You wanna talk about Bush and oil a little bit?

529 2018-07-05 23:03:07 Had my ex ask me for money for an oil change dawg took it & took a chick to Xtream action park while I was at work
530 2018-07-05 23:02:35 @GMCustomerSvc going on two hours now at the dealer for a simple oil change. With an appointment. Wtf
531 2018-07-05 23:02:32 And we import more oil!
532 2018-07-05 23:02:28 Lavender Essential Oil works great for acne scars! Massage into face gently before bedtime. It has a great scent + helps you sleep.
533 2018-07-05 23:02:06 I think what you mean is “dilbit” and oil are not the same thing. Bitumen and oil, however, are the same. Do I believe that we should move past fossil fuel? Of course! But I also realize that by the end of 2018 the world will demand 100 million barrels PER DAY!

535 2018-07-05 23:01:59 I can beat it took my car to the dealer. I need anew battery 4 my key, oil change. Then they found my alinement was off, I need rear brakes. I noticed something wrong with my car. I was driveable .

539 2018-07-05 23:01:26 Selling that snake oil in his softest sweetest voice!!
540 2018-07-05 23:01:25 Shouldn't be subsidizing oil or any automater imo.
541 2018-07-05 23:01:21 Every single time you Republican greed mongers grab power, oil prices soar.
542 2018-07-05 23:01:16 They’ll likely be on Fox News or at least Exxon commercials for “biofuel research”. Rotting plants in a swamp eventually become oil and natural gas.
543 2018-07-05 23:01:15 .....and the price of oil rising, (which raises the price of everything) because he pulled out of the Iran deal, so they can’t sell oil, now there is a global shortage. Farmers are going out of business, your environment is screwed, what exactly has he cleaned up?
544 2018-07-05 23:01:13 I take fish oil 
545 2018-07-05 23:01:07 Now we have another asshat oil man stepping up to take his place. The swamp is still oozing. Now lets get #StinkyZinke to quit!!!! #Saveourplanet
546 2018-07-05 23:00:44 Not a contradiction. Rich global corporations & rich dictators support whoever has money all up and down the market chain. Sell/buy arms/oil/resources to whoever.  What you call them irrelevant to the violent chaos that ensues when only money/power counts to players at the top.

550 2018-07-05 23:00:31 Wash them with soap and water. Try Tea Tree oil. You'll have to reapply over n over.
551 2018-07-05 23:00:24 Get a sales tax, it will help the Government be less vulnerable to cycles in Oil and Gas. Remember, AB doesn't control the price of oil.

553 2018-07-05 23:00:19 @TheMeltingPot  Does the four-course dinner come with cooking oil OTHER than the Seasoned Vegetable broth or is the oil an extra cost above the $42.25 for the four-course dinner.
554 2018-07-05 23:00:10 Crooked Scott Pruitt helped big oil to fight the EPA and pollute our air and water. That helped fundraising for the GOP, but a stupid choice to run the EPA. Good riddance. I'm sure he will do well as big oil lobbyist.

557 2018-07-05 22:59:36 Koch sitting on some gee whiz coal to gas technology? 9/11 a Koch Operation? Twin Towers a David? Rockefeller construction. Papa Koch hated Rockefellers and Standard Oil. Standard Oil stole patent on Koch tech. Koch sued. Lost. Blamed crooked/paid off judge. Big grudge.
558 2018-07-05 22:59:25 I miss you toooooo! I would come scoop if I didn’t need an oil change
559 2018-07-05 22:59:20 It truly depends on whether his handler (Putin) thinks he can really get his $1.5B back from Venezuelan oil giant. DT is just following orders. His actions are obvious! Please Mueller just follow the money & dead bodies left by Putin. So we can be rid of this traitorous clown!!
560 2018-07-05 22:59:16 Have they got our strategic oil reserves back yet?

566 2018-07-05 22:58:43 In 2017, 50% of gasoline price was the price of oil, down from an average 61% 2008-2017.  Fed/State Taxes, on other hand went from 15% to 19%, a huge tax.  Want lower prices, bitch about govt and its taxes! (Source: US Energy Admin)

573 2018-07-05 22:58:25 about major progressive candidates and politicians. Centrist democrats don’t cut it anymore in 2018. They’d be content to let minorities and the poor get screwed in the deal and keep waging corporate oil wars in the Middle East.
574 2018-07-05 22:58:21 What does that even mean? Are you another that thinks Bitumen is the same thing as oil? Are you also unaware of the world-wide declaration that our need to evolve from oil/oil products is critical?

584 2018-07-05 22:56:49 Bit too much oil in the mixture?

586 2018-07-05 22:56:24 Tie half of them up and dry them.

Peel a load and confit the cloves. Keep them in the oil.

Do a chicken with forty cloves of garlic. But probably with a few more. The Nigel Slater recipe works best. As ever.

592 2018-07-05 22:55:50 You keep pumping articles at me about how much oil there is. Oil will be there long after people stop using it.

603 2018-07-05 22:54:57 So we help fund NATO and #trump thinks that means we are paying for oil and gas purchases for any counry in NATO for their own use.  That is a stretch even for @POTUS
604 2018-07-05 22:54:52 Leadership? Why are they silent on coal exports? Natural gas projects in BC? Site C dam? Importing oil from countries with lax environmental laws and that persecute minorities? Yes, that’s real leadership. They are puppets of foreign money, dont forget that.
605 2018-07-05 22:54:51 Do you think there will be a 3rd oil shock in the next two or three years?
606 2018-07-05 22:54:43 now Pruitt can go back to his old job of endlessly suing the EPA on behalf of big oil
607 2018-07-05 22:54:39 oils look nicer but oil paint can take days to dry (tho water based might dry quicker i’m not sure) so i would go with acrylics

624 2018-07-05 22:52:57 EPA is now known as the Extreme Pollution Agency. I believe Trump waited through all the scandals & corruption until maximum damage was done & mining and gas/oil deals signed, so his successor could just continue apace. Environmental ruin by relay.
625 2018-07-05 22:52:48 Linette, keep rooting for global warming. Don't need EVs, I'd rather die of starvation than step my foot into an EV. Keep up the good work and help big oil and shorters. You're doing an important work that will help humans die sooner.

632 2018-07-05 22:52:19 Pruitt’s “transformative work": allowing coal mines to dump waste into streams & rivers, relieving oil and gas companies of the pesky business of letting anyone know when they leak huge plumes of methane into the air, allowing factory farms to flood streams with animal waste . .
633 2018-07-05 22:52:14 They are thick as thieves & probably want oil.
634 2018-07-05 22:52:01 I find it amazing Mr. Trump's pressuring Saudi Arabia to increase oil production for USA. OPEC oil quotas're established among all members and still includes Iran. Since Mr. Trump abrogated the Iran Agreement, Iran's quota'll go elsewhere. Mr. Trump's shafted USA consumers again.
635 2018-07-05 22:51:50 It's a perfect illustration of how crazed the Far Right has become. They love national parks. They don't want fracking in their yards. But because DEMs are fighting against dirty air and water, MAGA-voters take the other side. It's not as tho they'll profit from oil & gas money.

700 2018-07-05 22:46:26 Like l said before, you could have all the money in the world and be miserable. For a “kingdom” your gdp is some shit, for a country with all that “oil”, your gdp is a joke. We’re recovering from a 20+ dictatorship after YOUR king accepted him with open arms so fall back
701 2018-07-05 22:46:06 Matt, if you want alternative energy, you want high oil prices.  Do all liberals lack economic sense?  YES
702 2018-07-05 22:46:04 Brian, we need to focus on the money trail please! All this talk of impeach, prison, etc is not going to come to fruition unless we follow the money!!
Why Venezuela?!? Rosneft lent a Venezuelan oil giant $1.5Billon!! Putin wants to insure he gets his money back!! #PutinsPuppet
703 2018-07-05 22:45:55 1/ Gas price today 1.32, oil $74, when oil was $110.00 gas price 1.20. the only difference I see is Ab CT. If the tax is charged at every level, from extraction, to refinement to the gas station, and then the consumer, it's tax on tax and the only explanation I can see
704 2018-07-05 22:45:50 Excuse, have yo ever heard about Godwin's Law?
But seriously, leaving oil aside, I suppose they want to do "something" about my country because of how corrupt and dangerous its regime has gotten.
It says something when we think of them as drug lords more than politicians.

706 2018-07-05 22:45:47 it’s not that i don’t WANT to try a new flavor of triscuit instead of getting rosemary and olive oil, it’s just that i don’t.....think i can
707 2018-07-05 22:45:46 Stir together 2 tablespoons ginger with 2 cups Cantaloupe. Mix into  Olive Oil. Boil. Serve
708 2018-07-05 22:45:40 As our Senator, Coloradans expect you to hold Andrew Wheeler accountable to uphold the true mission of the EPA and not the interests of Big Oil and coal.
709 2018-07-05 22:45:39 Let's remember when the gas prices continue to go up that we get 30% of our oil from Canada, an ally for literally forever until someone had to ruin that.
710 2018-07-05 22:45:29 @realDonaldTrump's EPA will turn every city and town into a Flint MI or Hoosick Falls NY, Pruitt's resignation not withstanding. Acting Director Andrew Wheeler is deep in the pocket of coal, oil and chemical industries. The more things change...
711 2018-07-05 22:45:24 Not because of you!  Oil is up!  Not your fault for the recession because of oil prices so u can’t take the credit now.
712 2018-07-05 22:45:22 おはようございます！

714 2018-07-05 22:45:20 It’s still an oil and it breaks down condoms. Go ahead and use it with a partner you trust and get tested with, but not safe for use with condoms because OIL breaks down latex.
715 2018-07-05 22:45:13 Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times, ends up running the EPA as a criminal for a criminal. Next week he will be a lobbyist for big oil. Wait he just resigned from that job too.
716 2018-07-05 22:45:05 Norway is so happy because they nationalized their oil production which pays for a large portion of their social services.......imagine if the usa did the same with their oil and gas, instead of trillions going into the pockets of a few the coffers of the states would overflow

718 2018-07-05 22:44:51 I worked in the oil and gas media for more than 20 years. You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
719 2018-07-05 22:44:48 My portfolio is 0% Canadian. Most people here are like 100% Canadian stocks even though Canada is 3% of world markets. I'm already too un-diversified living here with almost everything hinging on oil price.
720 2018-07-05 22:44:36 You got me with the brakes. I don’t know how to but YouTube prolly with teach me.  I got the oil change down tho
721 2018-07-05 22:44:34 He resigned because he was the subject of like 15 ethics investigations. He was using taxpayer money for luxuries and just generally being shady with coal/oil lobbyists
722 2018-07-05 22:44:30 I'm suggesting Trump nominate mega-conservative and fracker billionaire Tim Dunn to replace Pruitt. Let the Dems choose between a vocal lobbyist and their biggest nemesis in the oil & gas business.
723 2018-07-05 22:44:29 We have plenty of our own oil it's time to put Americans back to work.

727 2018-07-05 22:44:08 Los ruralistas (Federación Rural)  se quejan del aumento de la nafta.  Ellos no usan Gas oil? A quejarse siempre! Miente inventa y miente que siempre algo queda....  payasos!!!
728 2018-07-05 22:44:05 In this administration? Lots of friends in the oil, gas, and coal industries. A Koch connection is a plus.
729 2018-07-05 22:44:00 I’d rather be laying next to a pool,smelling like tanning oil , than be here at work .
730 2018-07-05 22:43:57 The hard part is cutting out the oils.  Trying to find buns that have no oil in them, it's been impossible for me so far.  :(

734 2018-07-05 22:43:20 Ororo...anointing oil 
735 2018-07-05 22:43:04 It's nice to see the Trump is friend every major person from oil tycoons to Coal Tycoon that was responsible for f****** the average American over and somehow Trump menace to get all them in the White House and Trump supporters don't see a problem with this it's hilarious
736 2018-07-05 22:42:53 Of course. But you also have to say why people in those areas choose snake oil rather than solutions that might help.
737 2018-07-05 22:42:48 To call this a win for them is silly. Should replace w CEO of an oil refiner as a f u
738 2018-07-05 22:42:47 Peeps, I'm trying my hardest. But I just don't have any effective meds that don't have potential side effects. And that includes CBD oil. Don't @ me. It's true. #sorrynotsorry
739 2018-07-05 22:42:43 Change a tire , breaks , oil ..... shit basically anything besides the engine 
Only real life skill I need that I don’t have is master of the grill
740 2018-07-05 22:42:41 It’s just nice to see Scott Pruitt finally listen to someone who isn’t an oil or coal lobbyist. #PruittResigns
741 2018-07-05 22:42:38 I'm way past snake oil, my friend;

What I don't do:
denigrate those who are trying to help others.

I hope someday you're able to move past 'doing just fine'.

744 2018-07-05 22:42:17 Largely due to 165,000 redundancies and reduced spending on local economies. Like business-closing reductions. People like Jim don’t give a shit about thousands of people out of work though. He’s got a Tory viewpoint when it comes to oil. He’s too dumb to understand.
745 2018-07-05 22:41:51 Btw, how much oil and other resources those America steal from African countries?

748 2018-07-05 22:41:44 I can only think of food, oil, new blinds?
749 2018-07-05 22:41:38 And sadly ,your president will probably add some oil on this fire of hatred!!

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
751 2018-07-05 22:41:33 I seasoned mine in the oven after rubbing olive oil on both sides at 350 for an hour. I never wash it, just wipe it down after each use. I have added more olive oil if it gets a dry spot.
752 2018-07-05 22:41:25 So, turns out cannabidiol and hemp/hemp oil can cause same signs as THC toxicity if doses high enough.

So, don't just haphazardly treat your dog!

(And keep stuff out of reach from your foolish dogs so they don't over dose themselves...)

753 2018-07-05 22:41:21 I remember Nov 16 oil was 50s and $RIG 16s ,  glory days...
754 2018-07-05 22:41:20 i go to bed at 4pm in winters bc im out of oil for my lamp
755 2018-07-05 22:41:13 Jobs are up, the oil price is up and the industry is growing again.
756 2018-07-05 22:41:05 I would have chosen Mr Lebowski. A powerful critique of oil and automobility.
757 2018-07-05 22:40:46 So around my area we have these things called discos used for cooking. They’re round steel discs taken from old farm equipment. We always just seasoned it with oil when hot. Then let it cool, wipe the excess & store like that. It’ll be good after a few uses.

759 2018-07-05 22:40:24 I have first-hand knowledge of the growth in jobs in the North Sea related to the oil price recorvery; as I have a family member working there.
760 2018-07-05 22:40:22 i bought rose oil infused shampoo (ty suave) and my hair jus. t. it smells so good u guys.
761 2018-07-05 22:40:21 Why shouldn't @realDonaldTrump tweet about too expensive oil prices?  EVERYBODY ELSE IS COMPLAINING TOO!  Thank you, Mr. President!
762 2018-07-05 22:40:18 Over here like do I wanna go buy some more peanut oil and fry my own chicken or just buy KFC because convenience... 
763 2018-07-05 22:40:18 Don’t let the door hit you in the ass as ya go you snake oil salesmen. Good riddance!

767 2018-07-05 22:39:55 Actually my dad just got a dedicated skillet/grill, and if I remember correctly, he used canola oil on it. I think it was twice before he cooked on it. I think pretty much he just had to get it hot, then apply the oil.
768 2018-07-05 22:39:53 Our guys just  completed a major field-trial into invasive species control. Multi-year. Very nuanced. Gist of research completely lost BBC, Mail and Telegraph headlines. Much midnight oil burning to correct!
769 2018-07-05 22:39:45 @tsunami_waves Would love to help out with an oil painting at one of your next charity events!
770 2018-07-05 22:39:44 Wait till Canada cuts oil with Tariffs and fuel hits $6.00.
771 2018-07-05 22:39:43 The pipeline is an environmental issue that's in court, not oil being sold to BC. There's no actual trade. It's an issue, just not a trade one. The threat about wine is just posturing but like I said, you could choose to see that as a trade skirmish :) Hurts both sides.
772 2018-07-05 22:39:37 @benshapiro Ben I'm gonna pour a quart of motor oil down my storm drain to protest the Scott Pruitt resignation. I say shut down the EPA, the environment can take care if itself. Regs are stifling business.

774 2018-07-05 22:39:33 Thanks to those who came out to watch the short show of shenanigans and marvelous meandering through the lovely shades of dirt, light dirt, dark dirt, and oil. Big thanks to @Teddy_M3 for the host! <3
775 2018-07-05 22:39:29 I’m in need of an old school hot oil treatment.
776 2018-07-05 22:39:06 Oh, and Henny aint gasoline?! That shit tastes like fucking motor oil. Lmao

778 2018-07-05 22:38:55 Mine are Oct/Nov.
However. 
I have a set amount of money in my bank account right now.
I'm going on a trip tomorrow with a friend and I have to get my oil changed this weekend.
At the end of the month I'm going to Mexico with my family. 
Then, I move to Reno, NV in August.

787 2018-07-05 22:37:25 Just think about it, the Bushes were partners with the Bin Ladens in an oil company and the fake news media didn’t care even, tho it was said that Bush didn’t want to capture Bin Laden,but they made a15 minute fuck with a whore 10 yrs beforeT was prez their main story for months.
788 2018-07-05 22:37:18 I have oily, acne-prone skin and @OleHenriksen has been doing it for me. They have skincare for oil/combo • normal • dry skin. I love using the TRUTH serum too. Great price point for quality products that work. They have travel size so if ya wanna try it.. it’s great

790 2018-07-05 22:36:52 Long ago the tie in to trump and Russia beyond the real estate Russian money laundering was the price of oil Russia's only real export and the source of where the money comes from and into trump properties

792 2018-07-05 22:36:36 @MyUS_Shopaholic Why do you charge me an extra 18 USD for a bottle of essential oil that is 100% natural and costs 8 USD... unsane. Why don't you have customer service, chat not working, phone neither, it's awful

794 2018-07-05 22:36:02 His great job was protecting Trumps investments in oil to benefit his donors & the Trump family empire. I will be celebrating the day we have someone heading the EPA who is protecting the environment, and a President who supports clean air, water and Americans health & logevity.
795 2018-07-05 22:35:43 He needs to respond to the lies. The oil industry, the auto industry, auto dealers and the flat earthers are all trying to destroy @Tesla with lies fed to lazy corrupt media.

800 2018-07-05 22:35:27 So my family Cooking an they make salad. When the time comes to eat the salad I’m like “ where’s the salad dressing “ they talking about we use oil . Y’all wtf I threw that shit back in.

802 2018-07-05 22:34:57 The first 200,000 EV cars from any auto maker get a federal tax credit; that simply reduces a persons tax liability. Tesla will be the first to use this up. But Tesla has already paid their loan & any incentives are far less than those to oil as well as recently bailed out autos.
803 2018-07-05 22:34:49 The Oil Refinery is back on STX?? AWWW SHEEETTT!!! Mappie yuh might be good for something!
804 2018-07-05 22:34:46 But perhaps we can push to repurpose the pipeline to carry noncarbon electrical generation as a storm hardened electrical grid conduit. Oil can use its infrastructure but change the kind of energy it carries. Oil fields become Thorium nuclear reactors or alternative energy.
805 2018-07-05 22:34:29 8 of them in Norway and 2 in the uk. Have you googled the production costs and how much the oil will be sold for? Have you googled how many Scottish and English people were made redundant because external forces made oil too cheap? 
165,000 people out of work at the last count.
806 2018-07-05 22:34:16 Saddam didn't need greenlight from the US to invade iran because he was always in soviet orbit & Iran was then US enemy, couldn't care less, but US didn't want either side to win, USSR was making profit arming both sides, boosting its oil and gas export to Europe, the real winner
807 2018-07-05 22:34:15 I used a toning oil and gels, but my Dr also told me it was genetic, so I just didn’t stress too much. I have dry skin anyways so the lotion helped with that 
808 2018-07-05 22:34:14 This is so disrespectful.  It's a rubber tire, *asbestos-containing joint compound*, and a crusted 20 year *crude* oil can. And the tire was burning at one point, but the fire was successfully extinguished using the least environmentally friendly means available.
809 2018-07-05 22:33:57 Don't forget to mention the oil spills and how to address cleaning up the long overdue Berkeley pit
810 2018-07-05 22:33:50 Sorry I'm the mug? For knowing brexit was a shit idea sold to us by liars and snake oil salesmen? Awe who cares too happy. Happy dead brexit day
811 2018-07-05 22:33:32 Alberta is the source of huge money to make the transfer payments to other provinces.BC wants a green economy , but not one party has any idea how to do that. BC and Alberta need to figure out how homeowners and business can move towards that, In the mean time, we sell oil
812 2018-07-05 22:33:29 I use coconut oil, bake it in an oven at 300 for about 90 minutes.
813 2018-07-05 22:33:25 Unfortunately he doesn't give 2 shits. His bank account is stuffed and he's probably got payola for a lifetime from big oil
814 2018-07-05 22:33:25 After the sweet potato is boiled in vegetable oil the benefits are mostly negated.
815 2018-07-05 22:33:23 Yet another option: send them to Saudi Arabia to protest oil shipments THERE. That would be fun!
816 2018-07-05 22:33:06 Aggiungo che le convenzioni oil prevedono che in caso di flussi di questa portata i governi interessati debbono concludere accordi per regolarli.
Savona lo vuol fare da ministro o vuole lasciare tutto al libero mercato?
817 2018-07-05 22:32:49 Extraversion olive oil
818 2018-07-05 22:32:45 Happened to me with tea tree oil. Oils need to be mixed with a carrier oil that is neutral.
819 2018-07-05 22:32:43 Clearly you've realised you made a mistake asking that question. And also revealed your ignorance when it comes to oil and gas news. The price of oil has also gone up considerably since 2014; not that you would know that. It'll be a bonus for Scotland for sure.
820 2018-07-05 22:32:16 What's so hard to believe about fighting a product that will kill off billions in coastal industry with one spill?  Oh, and if you aren't fighting against what oil resource co's have done to reserves across Cda, you don't have any right talking about any other country.
821 2018-07-05 22:32:06 My normal protein plus root veg carbs plus non starch veg / salad, plus a little olive oil dressing 2 -3 hours before bed and I sleep like a log.
822 2018-07-05 22:32:06 No es como el gas oil infinia. Tecnicamente desactiva el azufre que contiene el gas oil evitando que la combustion produzca acido sulfurico. Creo que es asi. Pero jhon deere lo empezo a traer cuando las primeras axiales con inyexion elec tuvieron problemas.
823 2018-07-05 22:32:02 It's not for everybody, but I love putting the tiniest pinch of sea salt on top of chocolate chip cookies (especially these shortbread ones I make). I love a good lemon bar; saw a recipe in the Times that has olive oil in it (which sounds weird, but they finish with salt, so I'm

828 2018-07-05 22:31:41 Price of oil IS up.  Pity we can’t get our product to market so that we could sell it at going prices...
829 2018-07-05 22:31:31 Can't Pruitt be charged with anything? Surely, he broke some law - right? Or, does he get to ride on in the sunset to a cushy job with an oil company?
830 2018-07-05 22:31:30 We are going to watch this second sycophant as closely as Pruitt for the same self serving damaging to the entire planet promotion of filthy coal and oil fossil fuels that are curling Global Warming.
831 2018-07-05 22:31:27 The Spanky corrupt oil snake show comes to your town. To bring your mentality down
832 2018-07-05 22:31:25 Tip for the ladies: put coconut oil on your skin before shaving. Thank me later
833 2018-07-05 22:31:14 Remember, clueless crook Pruitt was following orders from Frump and the big oil, car, manufacturing bigwigs. I’m happy he’s gone, and now what? More of the same, perhaps with a bit less outright corruption. 
834 2018-07-05 22:31:13 he literally must have rubbed oil all over his glorious perfect body just for this picture and i fucking hate* him

*LOVE
835 2018-07-05 22:31:01 teens judging me for having a face full of pricey rose oil. bitch i hope you're not mentally ill in your late twenties bc let me tell u
836 2018-07-05 22:31:00 Spends money to buy a flag, burns flag to try and upset people.  LOL.

Do you wreck your car every time you want to give a big middle finger to the oil industry?
837 2018-07-05 22:30:58 Big Oil will miss him. Fracker.
838 2018-07-05 22:30:40 7 and a half hours.
Then I finish till Tuesday.
Not all bad.
Everything has gone wrong tonight .
Covered in oil and chocolate and it is so warm.
Have a wonderful day and please take care.
839 2018-07-05 22:30:34 #growingupbritish Summers spent swimming in muddy river pools, olive oil to 'protect' your skin (honestly) bare feet all summer, the smell of melted tar on the roads
840 2018-07-05 22:30:32 It is EASY to get price targets of oil wrong[ easier to point out when targets wrong...hindsight, right.  So don't dwell too long on that. Consider the "if then" conditions set out by analysts.  IF oil is at X THEN this means Y for this company. That information in very valuable.
841 2018-07-05 22:30:31 Have any of you tried CBD oil for anxiety? (No, it’s not marijuana, it can’t get you high, and it’s legal in all 50 states )

844 2018-07-05 22:30:17 I don’t dislike them, I just don’t see it happening this year. Gonna take a couple years to recover from the snake oil salesman Jimmy Mac.
845 2018-07-05 22:30:14 It’s ok to be a Republican and still believe in treating the environment right/protecting clean water. Think about your children’s future, and not about lining the pockets of oil tycoons. 
846 2018-07-05 22:30:12 My barber is open 7 days. The fact they charge $50 per cut, always have a queue, and sell a lot of value adds (product, shampoo, beard oil) has me thinking they’re probably doing ok on a Sunday. But hey, they provide a great service and market well.
847 2018-07-05 22:30:11 Aggiungo che le convenzioni oil che l'Italia ha ratificato impongono all'Italia di occuparsi dei migranti anche durante il viaggio indipendentemente dalla liceità del flusso.
848 2018-07-05 22:29:54 Likewise. I usually put in chili oil too, it's excellent.
849 2018-07-05 22:29:42 (KJV) Revelation 6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
850 2018-07-05 22:29:41 You could probably make an oil based salad dressing. Instead of using butter use coconut oil. And you could get a cheap brand that doesn’t really taste too much like coconuts.
851 2018-07-05 22:29:37 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."

852 2018-07-05 22:29:31 I probably have that wrong... hemp oil.
853 2018-07-05 22:29:30 Trump should nominate an oil tycoon in his place just to own the Pina
854 2018-07-05 22:29:16 Trump's shortlist for the next director of the EPA has leaked: 

1. The literal embodiment of global warming. 
2. A cartoon oil baron. 
3. gun.

856 2018-07-05 22:29:06 Another option: forbid all these persons from using oil products for one year. If they are still alive one year later they’ll be on their knees begging for oil.

858 2018-07-05 22:28:25 Wheeler is no better than Pruitt was.  Wheeler is a fierce critic of climate protection and an ex-lobbyist for coal, chemical and oil companies.
859 2018-07-05 22:28:22 We already know that Putin told you to get out of Iran deal because his oil company needs to sell oil at higher price. Putin also wants you to start shit with OPEC so you'll force US to buy rosfnet oil from Russia. Shoe licker!!
860 2018-07-05 22:28:19 Garlic and onions cooked in a little olive oil are forever my jam
861 2018-07-05 22:28:17 Got a good idea for "crispies" to put on a hamburger - tempura batter drizzled into hot oil ... cooled, and then use as garnish.
862 2018-07-05 22:28:13 Don't forget to add on the lavender scented oil, bruh. Get mad relaxed af.
863 2018-07-05 22:28:08 You forgot perhaps one of the most important, Zinke. His goal to see oil/gas ruination on ALL of our (remaining; remember he nixed/downsized a lot of public lands) public lands, including the Alaskan Wilderness. He must go. Like yesterday.

869 2018-07-05 22:27:32 Remember in 1001 Rabbit Tales when Yosemite Sam tries to boil Bugs Bunny in oil?
870 2018-07-05 22:27:25 Scott must be letting ol Hugh here in on his travel sized lotion grift. This is ridiculous. Countdown to Pruitt taking an oil exec job starts now.
871 2018-07-05 22:27:24 It's a good day for anyone who gives half a fuck about the environment cuz Scott Pruit has stepped down and stopped giving land rights to oil companies etc. Which means we might be able to save the landscape for another century or so
872 2018-07-05 22:27:22 Gotta remember, as the big liar said after the 2014 vote.
OIL IS JUST A BONUS.
now gtf
873 2018-07-05 22:27:08 Take out the oil guy and replace him with his deputy, a coal guy.
874 2018-07-05 22:27:04 Treated myself to a @ZoellaBeauty lip oil on Wednesday. Expecting it to be absolute pants....but it smells like baby all gone so I needed it! Put it on before bed (super dry cracked lips) woke up to beautifully hydrated soft lips! Amazed! Would highly recommend!! #ZoellaBeauty
875 2018-07-05 22:26:50 Because the frack happy oil hungry imperialist Democrats are so caring about the life on earth that they might have missed with their bombs and drones.
876 2018-07-05 22:26:48 Money talk the Iraq war cost the USA including veterans care for life $4 trillion. A war with Iran would cost $8 trillion add the economic costs of higher prices of oil to the world economy which will be reflected on USA directly and indirectly.
877 2018-07-05 22:26:29 Forgotten what a bloody great film The Descent is as well as a brilliant cast, one of Neil Marshall’s best and glad to see he’s back to film directing with Hellboy. Whatever happened to his zombies on an oil rig idea he wrote about monthly in Empire magazine years back?
878 2018-07-05 22:26:24 Captured EPA guy in Utah, gasping from the 15-ft chase, his tactical pants (Scottie's gift) in shreds. Gave him water from Uinta Basin. Surrendered email from Robbie [Bishop] OKing relaxed EPA regs for oil drilling in Basin. Sent email to HQ.  Staffer died. #secondcivilwarletters
879 2018-07-05 22:26:06 no o, i didnt.. my mum knows someone that mixes it so she told her what to put in it ... ori and coconut oil; your babies must smell so delicious!!
880 2018-07-05 22:25:57 But keep hurling out fear of this or that and think you're gonna coast by on the lesser of two evils... Lol, and your tactics will fail again and again, people, especially millenials just aren't buying your snake oil.  Move hard left or LOSE
881 2018-07-05 22:25:56 Like acid and oil on a madman’s face reason tends to fly away ...
882 2018-07-05 22:25:53 Let's hope Andy doesn't make our air, land, and water much worse than it already is and is heading, and lets the big oil companies buy him off, like most of the current administration.
883 2018-07-05 22:25:46 Big pharmaceutical shuts down cures for cancer. The music industry tried silencing iTunes. The taxi & consumer transport industry tried silencing Uber. 

Now big oil want to ruin Tesla. 

Adapt or die.
884 2018-07-05 22:25:29 Darling,
We managed to construct the lens of transparency and let the sun shine through to General Pruitt.   His skin burned away leaving black smoke and thick oil standing in human form, forever haunting our dreams and the hillside.  Pray for those hills. #secondcivilwarletters
885 2018-07-05 22:25:23 Hybrid: good and bad points. Full EV: Ultra fast charging won't be ready for  10+ years yet. Can take hours for a 30% charge. Great for in a city nipping here & there, rubbish for long journeys. I work for an oil company so we take this VERY seriously

887 2018-07-05 22:25:17 After applying coconut oil on my hair and letting it dry for 2 hours my girlfriend tells me that oil is now inside my skin.

904 2018-07-05 22:22:17 His blatant corruption & self dealings aside he was also doing great harm to the environment & the cause of fighting climate change. Destroying decades of regulations was NOT pro-people
It was being done in the name of BIG OIL, fossil fuel lobbyists and corporate GREED. 
WAKE UP
905 2018-07-05 22:22:12 I firmly believe in the Italian evil eye. Someone is giving it to me. Since Saturday the 30th, I've had to get an oil change, front brakes, a headlight, 2 tail lights and an air conditioner for my living room. #evileye
906 2018-07-05 22:22:10 Nigeria  is the 6th largest producer of crude oil in the world, & not in a situation of war. We have no business being on this list in the first place, but due to CORRUPTION, BAD LEADERSHIP, & GREED on the part of the political class we're in this mess

910 2018-07-05 22:21:52 Name one environmental protection he introduced while there?  Just one. Now name how many regulations he overturned because it cost corporations money.. there’s a few. How about anything to do with reducing our reliance on foreign oil or anything to advance renewable energy?
911 2018-07-05 22:21:42 This is what I've researched. I've had a look on your link but can't find CBD oil??

So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified. Isaiah 61:3
913 2018-07-05 22:21:31 Holy shit! Pruitt resigned!!! I didn’t think Trump supporters could feel shame! What next? Trump apologizes?! Can’t wait to see what oil lobbyist Trump picks next.

923 2018-07-05 22:20:06 Make no mistake. Their inventory of sea mines is vast. Any vessel can lay mines. Although they haven't done it in the past, they are a hardline regime and they know the effect on world oil prices. As a RCN Vet and having sailed in the region, trust me. They have the capability.

That feels extremely yummy on the skin, If you want to experience that natural spa feeling at home this is a great way to start.
943 2018-07-05 22:17:58 You’re on glue. Pruitt is corrupt to the bone, in bed with oil & gas going back to his days in Oklahoma. He’s a downright crook and you are clearly delusional.
944 2018-07-05 22:17:55 バイク談議始まっちゃって仕事にならなさそうｗ
945 2018-07-05 22:17:51 Bottom line is that Pruitt was beyond terrible. He was was literally working against the mission of EPA. The entire purpose of EPA is to monitor, regulate and sanction violators. Their job isn't to cozy up to big oil and industry.

Any replacement will be an upgrade.

956 2018-07-05 22:17:02 The US offshore oil industry is in tatters. Why do you want to under cut good jobs for American workers with foreign oil?

962 2018-07-05 22:16:20 It’s oil. Try putting a latex condom over your hand and dip it in coconut oil, the condom will disintegrate and break after a few minutes.
963 2018-07-05 22:16:19 Lizzo really snapped with Coconut Oil huh?
964 2018-07-05 22:15:48 Just another Democrat scam being pushed by radical lefty Moulton. Al Gore cares so much about global warming, climate change, Severe weather or whatever you call it this week that he took $100 Million of dirty oil money from Qatar for his cable tv channel. #sethisafraud

18 yrs ago I did promo work for a nightclub. It involved me being Topless with only orange boiler suit pants on, covered in baby oil. 

In reflection, the woman stroking me, telling me what they wanted to do with me and grabbing my crotch..
978 2018-07-05 22:14:04 The future of the EPA is dismal thanks to you and your oil industry/coal industry minions.  Sorry.  They're the boss.  You're the minion!  Gutting any and every possible protection put into place to save our National Parks and Historical Sites, Our oceans.

997 2018-07-05 22:11:53 The essence of Big Oil is “Muahhaha” *while twirling mustache. People in power turned a blind eye years ago; plenty of decisions were made knowing the consequences to the environment and it is naive and irresponsible to let them off the hook in the name of progress.

1006 2018-07-05 22:10:31 I'd imagine @WellingtonWhale is having a few ironic LOLs about the fuss over fireworks after the oil industry was allowed to happily blast away with its seismic cannons. Under water, 24 hours a day, for months on end.

1022 2018-07-05 22:09:18 Nope, Hugh, you got it wrong again: gutting the #EPA in favor of coal & fossil fuels--& doing so while cozying-up to oil lobbyists--is lunacy & unconscionable... What's remarkable, you're not even close to hitting rock-bottom. So much further to fall.

1026 2018-07-05 22:09:01 Lol an eigth lasts me like 2 weeks. I'm blessed with a crazy low tolerance. If I could get thc oil cartridges legally in Ky I would throw all my lighters away tbh
1027 2018-07-05 22:08:55 The oil embargo helped kick-start "stagflation".
1028 2018-07-05 22:08:50 Yup...all the snake oil salesmen in one spot.
1029 2018-07-05 22:08:26 Time to say NO MORE CORRUPTION! Who is going to have the guts to jail him. Let's get rid of his assisting oil corrupt henchman!
1030 2018-07-05 22:08:24 Chop them up , mix with sugar , cover leave  on counter

1031 2018-07-05 22:08:09 18th and 19th century whalers hunted whales for their oil, which was used as lamp fuel and lubricant.
1032 2018-07-05 22:08:03 TBH, I'm shocked Trump didn't just appoint an actual leaking oil pipeline to be Scott Pruitt's replacement.
1033 2018-07-05 22:08:01 A coal lobbyist heading the EPA.
New boss same as the old boss.

Can’t wait to hear that water fowl are a perfectly acceptable clean up device for oil spills.   Fucking ugh
1034 2018-07-05 22:07:58 So about 50%.  The explosion in electrical consumption came to a screeching halt right about the time of the Arab Oil Embargo which, for those of you not around for that, was a huge shock to America, esp. since a lot of places generated electricity w/oil.
1035 2018-07-05 22:07:55 Agreed, shouldn’t be free of charge, that’s just substituting one form of subsidy with another. However, I support funding to get the infrastcr setup, the rest should take care of its self, the cost of unsubdzd pellets should work out cheaper than elec/oil. To clarify 1/2
1036 2018-07-05 22:07:47 Ask your mum if she has olive oil and heat it slightly and drop some into your ear then cover your ear with a heated cloth xx
1037 2018-07-05 22:07:47 CBD oil is the best healing concoction I’ve had in my life.
1038 2018-07-05 22:07:37 You reap what you sow.  Unfortunately the downstream impacts will also hurt the non-Trump base.  But if it primarily hurts the Trumpers, so be it.  Maybe it will open their eyes to the snake oil MAGA man.
1039 2018-07-05 22:07:26 RAILS are owned by Gates and or Buffett..they dont care if oil is shipped either pl or rail. Its hedged.

But now Canada needs a supa fast rail Yo!!
1040 2018-07-05 22:07:15 I believe Gov Scott's hands are dirty. He WAS keeping Zinke out of FL last year. Money is the only logical reason for the sudden change, but WHO'S MONEY? Access to FL Egs[.] oil ONLY benefits Putin & trump -- it WON'T even help FL workers if drilling began!!
1041 2018-07-05 22:07:13 Hugh Hewitt was just saying how his friend Pruitt was being dumped on. Awww poor baby, when he treats staff like personal servants, acts like he lives a life of danger, acts as employment agency for his wife, crawls into bed w coal/oil lobbyists, & runs up yuge travel expenses?
1042 2018-07-05 22:07:04 He will be a millionaire tomorrow....big oil/coal will take care of him.
1043 2018-07-05 22:06:58 What happens when the USD is no longer the petroleum dollar? If the Chinese yuan is used for oil transactions the used value tanks. It's already 15/1 not in our favor

1046 2018-07-05 22:06:42 It is not soy free, but it contains less than 2% soy. Mostly wheat, potatoes and coconut oil.

1048 2018-07-05 22:06:26 It’s a dogwhistle to the ‘moral majority’ (actually a minority) Bible-Belt Christian supporters that he is not defying God’s Will, but doing the important work of protecting his family, while keeping his options open for private sector work.

1052 2018-07-05 22:06:03 Just because he was corrupt, a thief,  a terrible boss and an all around person, it doesn't mean that he was a corrupt thief who was running the EPA into the ground in an effort to get oil money.
1053 2018-07-05 22:05:55 They will do what ever it takes to remain in power. Including appealing to nationalism trying to takle oil cargos. The "deal" with Iran was so good that they want it back.
1054 2018-07-05 22:05:53 This is not a pizza just because it has (arguable) bread and a tomato element. This is like strapping a piece of glass to a bottle of motor oil with a rubber band and calling it a car.
1055 2018-07-05 22:05:53 Zinke is harming the land as much as Pruitt did. Zinke manages to fly under the radar. Zinke is doing great harm to Native American lands. He is opening them up to oil, gas, and mineral mining.
1056 2018-07-05 22:05:42 Since when did a shit, shave and a shower turn into that + exfoliate, face pack, body butter, beard shaping, beard oil....whaaaaaaa
1057 2018-07-05 22:05:39 And then there was the wait for the special ink made by children at the Mexican border out of liberals' tears and Iraqi oil, and the fountain pen carved from a single tusk of a white rhino (which was, of course, killed).

49/ Steele's dossier says Trump was going to be given a cut of Russia's largest-ever oil deal—the sale of a portion of Rosneft in December 2016—in exchange for pushing pro-Russia sanctions policy during the campaign and after.
1060 2018-07-05 22:05:08 Someone, I don't remember who, tweeted that each of their states have stakes in the oil and gas industries.
In the face of the Russia investigation after an attack on our election, etc., their meet & greet on the 4th of July, was reprehensible.

1069 2018-07-05 22:03:46 coconut oil dries my skin out unfortunately but I make a mixture of shae vitamin e maybe throw some olive oil in and bam it moisturizes my skin so well  sometimes i use aloe vera straight from the plant after i use my spin brush and it’s helps a lot too

1072 2018-07-05 22:03:17 The leeches intend to drain the last drop from oil. Unfortunately for them, the transfer will not be smooth and a significant number will make the transition into poverty or at least middle class obscurity.
1073 2018-07-05 22:03:10 Major step backward in Bizarro Land. Major step forward in Reality Land. 

"But what about all that money from the Big Oil Lobby?"
1074 2018-07-05 22:03:05 Meeee too. Always. Try the oil since drs won't keep you on happy pills forever. 
I might have the worst anxiety ever and it cuts it in half. That along with laughing helps. A TON. I just followed a bunch of cbd oil pages here on Twitter too.
1075 2018-07-05 22:02:53 But a better policy is export the oil to people who will buy it regardless and use the profits to develop green technology.  Is this not a sensible proposal?

1082 2018-07-05 22:02:22 Yeah let it sit for 10 minutes, get a flea comb if you can for any runaways since they’ll try to run up and get air. Cedar oil, lemongrass oil and water in a spray bottle also works
1083 2018-07-05 22:02:18 Wonder if all those states want some Russia love. Mining, oil, gas. Could be looking to make deals to sell their states out from under their constituents noses. Hypothetically speaking, of course
1084 2018-07-05 22:02:13 It's mandatory. 
President Trump must impose a 35% remittance tax to all US remittances going to Mexico. Mexican economy first source of income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture...Mexico as a country can't survive without US remittances.......
1085 2018-07-05 22:01:56 I think Trump’s planning to cancel sanctions at summit withPutin. This Moscow trip is laying the groundwork to make that move & get RU oil development going. Even canceled Iran deal was to boost oil prices. Whatever Puti asks he gets from this corrupt POTUS.
1086 2018-07-05 22:01:51 Nice work @AaronMesh &  @wweek.

Last time there was a major fire at a PDX used oil facility (Thermofluids), the company pled to criminal charges & the CEO went to jail.

The EPA agents & AUSA running enviro cases in this town are top shelf. If there’s a case, they’ll make it.

1097 2018-07-05 22:00:26 I've heard he plans to nominate Joseph Hazelwood - the captain on duty of the Valdez that got drunk when it had the big oil spill.
1098 2018-07-05 22:00:22 Stan u must have a head start on the spinning Canabis Oil.
1099 2018-07-05 22:00:22 @AudiOfficial just beat my wife for $400 to change oil and rotate tires. They never change #thieves
1100 2018-07-05 22:00:08 Does it include oil and gas companies?
1101 2018-07-05 22:00:08 @chigrl , hear me out. Why not have Administration #RickPerry sell huge amount of oil at spot, buy Dec futures to replace. Release same #SPR
1102 2018-07-05 22:00:05 *starts spraying a large symbol on the floor, surrounded by holy oil.*
Well, then I guess we get comfortable here for now.
1103 2018-07-05 22:00:04 and when they erected oil drilling derricks in the cajun country cemetery.... i could see the limits of things  sacred had been breached...@RuthHHopkins
1104 2018-07-05 21:59:52 Failing to price carbon pollution is morally bankrupt. It can and has been done responsibly. And Alberta's biggest businesses - oil and gas producers - already take into to account when making decisions. #ClimateAction
1105 2018-07-05 21:59:44 I met girls take dabs thinking it was going to be like their pen hits , “I hit my pen like 24/7 I know what smoking oil is” aaaaight girl hit this shit then lol
1106 2018-07-05 21:59:44 Oh yeah that fake gal owns that man today, she covered magazines 3months straight up, bagged 5movie roles, 3 endorsement and became CEO bam beauty oil, ur Alex who took another gals boy, ducked him on live TV after being fingered by Leo(2men) came back home with nothing
1107 2018-07-05 21:59:42 Just tell me before you start building, where did the reserve oil that was sold at a huge loss, where is that money? I reall would like a full investigation into Petro SA. We now pay R6.00 per liter tax. Something smelly here and it aint fish
1108 2018-07-05 21:59:32 OOF @LanaKirsh U BETTER SEND ME VIDEOS PF U PUTTING THE OIL PASTELS ON
1109 2018-07-05 21:59:31 It cures ... CBD oil saved my cats life ... I use dr bronners liquid soap and I can actually function for the day after bathing with it ... it has hemp in it .. I’m not on pain killers watched too many friends die from addiction and heart attacks from not getting their fix.
1110 2018-07-05 21:58:59 There's no difference between rep and dems both back backed by big pharma oil banks etc all.agreed to the Iraq war. So really all are bent fuckers
1111 2018-07-05 21:58:54 Oil of the snake
1112 2018-07-05 21:58:53 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
1113 2018-07-05 21:58:47 p,s,: Apparently Andrew Wheeler has deep ties to big oil. No more EPA conflicts-of-interest! The ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY was created to PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT - NOT ENERGY CORPORATIONS!! #IMPEACH #Stop45sCorruption
1114 2018-07-05 21:58:45 Oh we could survive on autarky but I wouldn't recommend trying it. Why is oil never brought up for tariffs on natsec grounds? More critical than steel.
1115 2018-07-05 21:58:44 comfort food will ALWAYS be pasta with oil and cheese
1116 2018-07-05 21:58:29 2 oil changes in two months 
1117 2018-07-05 21:58:22 Still I Rise

'You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room.
1118 2018-07-05 21:58:13 Someone at the U of C do a study on the correlation of Oil Prices and Darwinism. You can thank me later.
1119 2018-07-05 21:58:11 More due to Russian interference in 2016 Mr. Big Oil Lobbyist. Take your cone of silence with you.
1120 2018-07-05 21:58:06 “It’s just a scam by car companies and oil makers. Me and my mate bent to Portugal and back on the white bit”
1121 2018-07-05 21:57:48 It's fucked. The whole industry. We just put new struts on for a grand, and mow this shit. The UV kit shows heavy oil contamination. The dealership wants 3k + and they won't sell me the $100 tool to go elsewhere.
1122 2018-07-05 21:57:43 So now that Pruitt resigned & Trump admin went to Russia on 7/4 guess they will start drilling for oil in American waters at the beaches...first, then landmarks.

On another note, "let's eat" and not be conquered by guilt.
1123 2018-07-05 21:57:35 Those stupid car air fresheners from @bathbodyworks are not meant for this heat. Got in my car and saw a drop hit my hand. The stupid thing busted from the heat and dripped from my visor. Now I’ve got oil stains all over my seats, shirt & pants. #frustrated
1124 2018-07-05 21:57:23 Fuck the lighter that oil pen was just the biggest L yesterday
1125 2018-07-05 21:57:19 Out with the Oil Shill, in with the Coal Shill. 

#PruittResigns
#RepublicanReich
1126 2018-07-05 21:57:14 1.blend egg2. add oil
1127 2018-07-05 21:57:12 And the next one will be too. Pruitt was oil and gas; Andrew Wheeler is coal. At least it's an anachronistic industry. . .
1128 2018-07-05 21:56:51 Unfortunately he's immediately replaced by another climate change / science denier: Andrew Wheeler. Another lackey for the coal/oil companies.
1129 2018-07-05 21:56:49 Just got the @BECCA_COSMETICS @chrissyteigen Glow oil - zomg this needs to be a perfume! It’s the perfect summer beachy scent  #BECCAxChrissy
1130 2018-07-05 21:56:35 I know we're all happy Scott Pruitt is gone, but keep in mind this just paves the way for EPA director John Asbestos-Infused Oil Slick, Drowner of Birds in Oil, Poisoner of Kitties, Hammerer of Puppies.

He's Cheney's nephew.
1131 2018-07-05 21:56:34 can I get a veggie sandwich with extra oil? 
1132 2018-07-05 21:56:22 Fuck THC oil & pens. Weak af ive had “girl scout cookies” since my birthday because it’s a fuckin waste
1133 2018-07-05 21:56:20 michael is so tolerant to put up with my stinky ass skin care, I fully wish Cider Vinegar and Tea Tree Oil didnt stink so bad
1134 2018-07-05 21:56:09 Tea tree oil .. & drink lots of water 
1135 2018-07-05 21:56:05 Oil Money problems! #MCFC
1136 2018-07-05 21:55:57 I knew a guy who ONLY jerked off with coconut oil and my biggest regret is not letting him take me to Applebee’s cause I was too good for a 2/$20
1137 2018-07-05 21:55:51 Oil change
1138 2018-07-05 21:55:47 @realDonaldTrump But if the oil sanctions are not fully implemented, I'm 100% sure that the Republicans will fail, the American people will closely monitor everything.
1139 2018-07-05 21:55:45 His pockets have already been well lined by big oil and mines for the damage he’s done. I sure hope we get a good next president! Because his first term will be cleaning up this mess. He can manage his wife’s chik filet
1140 2018-07-05 21:55:43 It is an insult to believe that President al-Bashir will protect South Sudan's oil fields. There is no way you can reunite with a country you tried to get off your backs for 50 years to protect our oil fields.
1141 2018-07-05 21:55:41 They said #Saddam was dictator &oppressed he should be removed they said #Kadafi was dictator &oppressed he should be removed they Did to #Asad 2 do they care about plp?NO they cared about(OIL) #Israel 2dictate&oppressed the region now People in the region are suffering @UN @hrw
1142 2018-07-05 21:55:37 Precious oil poured on your head. God’s blessing, even LIFE forevermore. 
#ChosenOne #YesItLooksGoodOnYou
1143 2018-07-05 21:55:27 i have a heating pad and peppermint oil for my headaches nothing will stop me from enjoying my night
1144 2018-07-05 21:55:24 @realDonaldTrump there is a boycott of oil, and people will know that regime change will take place in Iran with the boycott of oil. I said that if you cancel the agreement and bring the sanctions fully back, Republicans will win, I've repeatedly said this.
1145 2018-07-05 21:55:18 Pruitt’s a toady for big oil profits.  He had no business being in government in any capacity.
1146 2018-07-05 21:55:18 I see a pattern. @exxonmobil CEO taking over after Tillerson canceled all projects planned to develop Russia’sArctic oil fields. @PutinRF_Eng needs western capital & expertise to invest & develop RU oil. Must have that & higher oil prices 4 RU economy
1147 2018-07-05 21:55:11 a homemade one with argan oil, sugar, honey, and lime juice
1148 2018-07-05 21:55:10 You are wrong and appear not to have understood any of the points I have made. As for the big government question you clearly favor unregulated capitalism in which anything you can sell on a lie goes like snake oil, drugs, pollution and waste.
1149 2018-07-05 21:55:02 Ohhh I’m going to try vitamin c cleansers, thanks girl. I try all sorts of stuff too  just started using rose hip oil like a month ago. Love 
1150 2018-07-05 21:54:59 @realDonaldTrump I am sure that the Republicans will be defeated if the Iranian oil boycott is not implemented by November. More important than the cancellation of the nuclear deal
1151 2018-07-05 21:54:53 I lost my lighter last night and my oil pen I’m sad
1152 2018-07-05 21:54:39 @Hyundai - I rcvd notice of a safety recall on my #Ioniq.  It says the HCA repair will be done free of charge... Gee, thanks!! (Eye roll.) You should be offering a FREE OIL CHANGE in exchange for the huge inconvenience.  This has the potential to cost HOURS of my valuable time.
1153 2018-07-05 21:54:28 Where can I find a job application to rub oil on fat booty models?
1154 2018-07-05 21:54:15 It's really, really, hard to get people to give up money they've already put on their books, as oil companies do with drilling leases on reserves.

There are really epic, vast, sums of money on the line for powerful people, some of whom are actually above any law.
1155 2018-07-05 21:54:14 Issue same executive order against those invading villages and killing people. Remember one of your 3point agenda,was to diversify the economy from oil to agric? Farmers are been murdered on daily basis now, issue same executive order against them. Thank you Sir.
1156 2018-07-05 21:54:12 welp, I have to wait 2 hours for the coconut oil ... guess I'll continue yugioh
1157 2018-07-05 21:54:10 Plenty like Pruitt willing to destroy the earth for the oil/coal/pesticides/industries any and all drillers willing to pay $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
1158 2018-07-05 21:53:46 Very good article.Agree : If near term economic data and labour market support the FED path to normalization, Powell will invert the term spread.The Bond market is in denial that he will especially with current uncertainties ( trade war, climbing oil prices and geopolitical risk)
1159 2018-07-05 21:53:37 In a similar vein.. the skills needed for the jobs are harder and costlier to get..Vocational education and TAFe has been run down, replaced by unregulated, fly by night snake oil 'private colleges' with little accountability
1160 2018-07-05 21:53:32 Escalating oil prices will be another burden on an economy that is choking on debt.
1161 2018-07-05 21:53:18 A few years ago I was in a bar in Norway & had a conversation with a drunk oil worker who was extremely well informed about US politics.
1162 2018-07-05 21:53:16 Because we still rely on oil
1163 2018-07-05 21:53:14 Abbott and Costello, Mickey and Minnie, Popeye and Olive Oil... hell, you don’t make the top 250.
1164 2018-07-05 21:53:13 Now Playing: Copp� - lavender oil : remix
1165 2018-07-05 21:53:05 They say Giorgio Armani's foundations are the best. I find tinted moisturisers the best lol.
I need to spray some toner or water after, sometimes. To get rid of cakiness. And I use rosehip oil before. Or makeup just doesnt glide on, on me. Kinda dry.
1166 2018-07-05 21:53:01 ひまわりちゃん。おはよう♡
昨夜は、疲れて早々にダウン
今日は、夜会を見直さないと〜

ハーバリウム見てくれて有難う。
OIL入れるの怖くて(..•˘_˘•..)
やっと投入。ヤッパリ浮いちゃうね！
今度は、チビッコの作る予定〜
お天気悪いから気を付けてね♡
今日も宜しく(＊'◇'＊)
1167 2018-07-05 21:52:57 We have never had a surplus not funded by natural gas. Oil has been far less valuable than natural gas. Natural gas prices have been extremely low since 2007.
1168 2018-07-05 21:52:48 The oil it’s fried in.
1169 2018-07-05 21:52:47 It will probably work. Cushy oil company job.
1170 2018-07-05 21:52:33 They said #Saddam was dictator &oppressed he should be removed they said #Kadafi was dictator &oppressed he should be removed they Did to #Asad 2 do they care about plp?NO they cared about(OIL) #Israel 2dictate&oppressed the region now People in the region are suffering @UN @hrw
1171 2018-07-05 21:52:30 Retweeted Jeffrey D. Sachs (@JeffDSachs):

Pruitt's replacement by Wheeler shows that it's swamp all the way down.  We've gone from an oil lobbyist to a coal lobbyist ... progress in Trump's America.
1172 2018-07-05 21:52:29 He was bought and paid for by the oil/gas companies in OKC.
1173 2018-07-05 21:52:28 Girl it pass dewy is full on oil 
1174 2018-07-05 21:52:25 But his replacement will be in oil...and we will have to watch him carefully!!!!!
1175 2018-07-05 21:52:22 2/ Fails to differentiate the “vegetable fat” line between oils like olive oil and avocado oil and actual vegetable oils, which are actually industrial seed oils.  If you’re going to dispute facts, you should do so with actual facts.
1176 2018-07-05 21:52:20 Predicting the future of fuel was wide open to a number of alternatives. However, the oil industry succeeded in eliminating the competition yet again, this time by supporting the anti-alcohol movements and the formation of the Prohibition Party in 1869...
1177 2018-07-05 21:52:19 Its great to hear that America is about to become the Number One Oil Producer in the world!!We will call the shots!!
1178 2018-07-05 21:52:12 I’ve used a lot of things, vitamin c cleansers, vitamin c oils, rose hip oil is really good too, some nights I’ll switch to retinol oil/ or the cream. I got it on amazon (the cream) I try to use the bare minimum on my skin
1179 2018-07-05 21:52:03 Thanks so much for the retweet! My biz opened in January and it has been full steam ahead ever since! Maneuvering social media as an Insurance Agent takes time so I REALLY appreciate the #B2B!
1180 2018-07-05 21:51:59 Pruitt resigning was long overdue as he was, how you say, doing everything he could to not protect the environment. Good riddance. Early front runners for replacement: every villain from Captain Planet and a leaking oil rig driving a hummer
1181 2018-07-05 21:51:54 Egypt, Lebanon,ect they were Christian countries once. I’m not talking about oil. I’m talking about Ideology, Islam takes over. Right wing preaching? No just the obvious outcome. So how do you not see a religious take over?
1182 2018-07-05 21:51:45 the anwar oil field is mostly gone.  its called "peak oil"  all they have left is the heavy sour oil. its harder to pump and pumps out of the ground with decreasing amounts.  they can say they will increase production... but in reality they cannot.
1183 2018-07-05 21:51:33 Smartest move Carstens made 4 Mexico was to hedge forward Mexico's crude oil exports b4 Crude Oil futures PLUNGED from  $110 to $30 during Gr8 Recession of 2008.
1184 2018-07-05 21:51:28 Drug trafficking ,terrorism, oil decline,and totalitarism in Venezuela is reason enough to the military option. People and children are dying EVERYDAY @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @VP . Dont take to long, God bless America.@POTUS
1185 2018-07-05 21:51:27 Baby Oil is so underrated,  has my skin feelin absolutely bliss
1186 2018-07-05 21:51:21 リツイートしてくれる方、ありがとう
1187 2018-07-05 21:51:21 I’m here at Walmart getting my oil changed and the mechanic drops the skid plate from the Hummer on his knee now he needs to go get stitches
1188 2018-07-05 21:51:17 Remember TrumpLand: Scott Pruitt Was Deregulating Rules & Working For BIG Oil & Gas To Help Them Make MORE Money While Making It EASIER To Pollute OUR Water/Air/Ecology. Scott Was NOT Working For YOU! @marthamaccallum @AC360 @MeetThePress @ChrisJansing @hardball @CSPANwj
1189 2018-07-05 21:51:17 New EPA chief is going to double offshore oil drilling in CA and you can't do a thing about it!   #MAGA
1190 2018-07-05 21:51:11 The US produces way more oil than Canada and is continually widening that gap. Yet to many Canada is the problem.
1191 2018-07-05 21:51:10 snake oil salesman
1192 2018-07-05 21:50:56 And honestly, its kinda rough how much oil is involved in our lives. Each person needs to make the change in their own lives (buy local, use less/no plastic, bike dont drive) if we want to see change. /1
1193 2018-07-05 21:50:53 1/ Nice graphic. A high fat diet recommends against vegetable fats bc they are inflammatory.  Olive & avocado oil - you can literally press the oil out and drink it.  Whereas canola goes thru a chem solution, degumming, cleansing, chemical bleaching, deodorization.  Your graphic
1194 2018-07-05 21:50:43 I read a tweet today, forgot who, but he pointed out that all of those MOC are from states with stakes in oil and gas.  Hmmm...
1195 2018-07-05 21:50:36 I don’t think this Black Seed Oil is for me...  — feeling nauseous
1196 2018-07-05 21:50:22 I need lavendar oil and a soul cleansing or something oh my god
1197 2018-07-05 21:50:16 Im bout to oil up my knee caps
1198 2018-07-05 21:50:13 Donald Trump’s next nominee to head up the EPA will be a sentient oil spill.
1199 2018-07-05 21:50:11 Went to go get a simple oil change just to find out I’m driving a human death machine. So nobody wake me up until my life stops being a pile of doo doo. Thanks

1200 2018-07-05 21:50:04 I liked the Juno oil, but that’s all I’ve tried. Objectively, her ingredients deck is great, unfortunately she uses stuff that I’m personally allergic to (weird allergies like aloe and sandalwood). I am interested in her Auto Correct eye cream though.
1201 2018-07-05 21:50:03 @patel4witham good to see you on @bbcquestiontime looking and sounding brilliant as ever.
1202 2018-07-05 21:50:02 whatever oil she is using or spell she has on tyler for him to be giving her all this attention ILL HAVE SOME OF THAT TOO
1203 2018-07-05 21:49:55 I keep seeing people tweet about their pets being scared on the fourth and every single time I reply and tell them to get cbd oil next year lol
1204 2018-07-05 21:49:36 It’s really Iran’s right to do that. That sea is technically their property,and can stop the exports. But then again,the US shouldn’t violate the law. They should cooperate and should not discourage people from buying oil from Iran. Then Iran would let the exports go.
1205 2018-07-05 21:49:23 Why 
1206 2018-07-05 21:49:18 This isn't rocket science.  Why is everyone confused why Pruitt held on this long????  He was there because the oil & gas industry was willing to do anything to keep him in office to kill every regulation possible, so Trump listened, for the money. @msnbc Get a clue. @exxonmobil

1210 2018-07-05 21:49:02 End government subsidies to the Stupidly Rich Oil Cartels. Try that for a start eh?
That's quite a few Hundred BILLION right?
1211 2018-07-05 21:48:27 Tesla do not make a profit it is a very very important platform for human development in the future too late to disapprove Tesla they already done proof technology the cat is out of the bag you cannot get it back electric car did not have a future oil company car company interest
1212 2018-07-05 21:48:18 I think you should sit down and try to think of one thing that doesn’t have oil in the mix. Know what you can’t. Keep the oil in the ground and you will starve and freeze in the dark
1213 2018-07-05 21:48:14 My opinion '
Am vs any prop of carrying out any milit.op vs hafter in oil ports from west libya , cuze that will be a big trap !
1214 2018-07-05 21:48:06 Skate liver oil! Thanks for the advice Krissy!!
1215 2018-07-05 21:48:03 Oh you mean keeping the EPA in name only lasting agenda, as your idea of progress is to remove all laws that protect the environment...& let your corporate buddies pollute with no care of the outcome...oil spills, polluted cancer causing air, toxic drinking water, all for greed..
1216 2018-07-05 21:47:46 since I’m off early let me go get my oil changed
1217 2018-07-05 21:47:35 Let’s put down the pipe and screw the lid back on your liquor bottle....Pruitt was hired because he ignored science and favored oil drilling and fracking
1218 2018-07-05 21:47:26 the oil is out of oil
1219 2018-07-05 21:47:15 Use vitamin e oil at night it would help remove the dry skin
1220 2018-07-05 21:46:49 @ImmaculateBkng is the palm oil you use in your products certified sustainable? i can’t find anything on your website about it. thanks!

1222 2018-07-05 21:46:41 THIS is the bottom line, isn't it? 
I've been saying that whoever controls water, controls the future. I am concerned that one day, safe drinking water will be worth far more per gallon than oil. We're due for toxic waterborne algae & bacteria if we don't CLEAN UP our actions.
1223 2018-07-05 21:46:31 Really excited to see all the great work our new EPA chair “giant bag of money covered in oil” can do for our environment!
1224 2018-07-05 21:46:30 Just because he's retiring doesn't mean you can't throw a shoe or crude oil at him. You should do that regardless of his employment status.

That’s the median pay for workers in the top sector in the U.S., according to newly released data. And no, it’s not tech. Spurred partly by the shale boom, Big Oil spend big bucks for folks like geologists and petroleum engineers.
1231 2018-07-05 21:45:59 When it comes to oil ask your self what has America done in the passed, it wil surely sacrifice small assesets for the bigger picture.
1232 2018-07-05 21:45:54 One thing since Donald Trump was elected @POTUS :

News from the administration every day!

MSM going through the swinging door constantly!

Progress for America in economic, regulation, Veterans, Citizens, oil 

Countries agree    
1233 2018-07-05 21:45:54 What else have you used to clear up acne scars? I feel like my bio oil isn’t as helpful as it used to be 
1234 2018-07-05 21:45:53 I think they figured out U.S.$ oil prices will be much higher in the medium term so the need for liquidity is less urgent.
1235 2018-07-05 21:45:46 Combine 4 tsps granola with 8 oz beer. Mix in Olive Oil. Boil. Serve for brunch
1236 2018-07-05 21:45:40 Coal and steel! Let's get the strip mining going along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. It's been green too long.Who needs oxygen!! Pruitt and Trump would have given BP/Deep Water Horizon awards for sinking the Gulf of Mexico under 5 million barrels of oil.
1237 2018-07-05 21:45:36 Look forward to the day a barge will be transporting the #dinosaur oil executives and their politician appeasers and climate deniers who continue to publicly dismiss #globalwarming to a #museum. #climatedenial #climate #climatechange #uspolitics #newyork #auspol
1238 2018-07-05 21:45:17 Try our new Barbara Bush's Hickory Smoked Truffle Hash. This hot mama's in a puddle of Grubbin' Gremlin Oil— (not available at lunch)! Only $14.99!
1239 2018-07-05 21:45:09 Finely mince 5 cloves of garlic, and lightly sautee in a 1 tbsp each of olive oil and butter over medium high heat. Add the garlic and fat to 2/3 cup of Olive Oil Mayonnaise, and add 1/2 tbsp of homemade, mild yellow curry paste, and 1/3 tsp freshly grated ginger.

1241 2018-07-05 21:45:03 They are not going to do it with sub $80 oil and Trump wants sub $80 oil.
1242 2018-07-05 21:45:01 Sides being at oil company with the dinosaur logo, what is the connection between dinosaurs and Sinclair? Always wondered, every since the dinosaurs TV show
1243 2018-07-05 21:45:00 @stevenmnuchin1 The companies and refineries are not supposed to make any crop, you dance with it. As you promised, you should not allow Iran to export a barrel of oil by November. You have been weak so far, this is clearly seen.
1244 2018-07-05 21:44:52 Shea moisture JBCO leave in, Shea moisture curl smoothie, oil and a little bit of flaxseed gel
1245 2018-07-05 21:44:49 With all of the increases in air pollution caused by the deregulation of oil and coal burning, there will be NOTHING BRIGHT about America's future. Andy will be known as the smog czar and will lead us away from a bright, pollution free environment. POTUS fucked US s again.
1246 2018-07-05 21:44:49 Right! All that emphasis on renewable energy. Not depending on Middle East oil. Wait! Did you say INdependence? Sorry, my bad!
1247 2018-07-05 21:44:47 Probably XD I'm always getting burnt or cut on that arm
it's my unlucky left 

I've only had one major burn but it was due to boiling water, the rest of the burns are all oil or hot surface scalds
1248 2018-07-05 21:44:45 I'm super glad that Pruitt is out, but I'm also pretty sure his job is about to be offered to a partially sentient oil spill, so.
1249 2018-07-05 21:44:39 @ChickfilA have you stopped using peanut oil? Your chicken and fries now make me sick, which is what canola oil does to me. I knew the taste had changed, and remember a change with biscuit prep a few years ago. I am unable up eat your stuff anymore.
1250 2018-07-05 21:44:34 I'm the trash that eats nice olive oil and balsamic vinegar with fuckin wonder bread
1251 2018-07-05 21:44:31 Great article. I feel I should point out this fact:

Paraffin, used to make the paper straws, is also a product of oil and gas production. Plastic requires more steps to get there, but they both come from hydrocarbons.

Also, private equity firms **are** debt saddling dicks.
1252 2018-07-05 21:44:26 It's almost like geopolitics has INFINITELY more effect on oil prices than marginal drilling regulations in America. 
1253 2018-07-05 21:44:24 Baka may oil dyan sa disyerto Lakas hehehe magiging mas mayaman pa kayo kaysa mga mangangalakal if sakali charot  #BAGANISIGNos

1255 2018-07-05 21:44:20 .@EPAScottPruitt has virtually turned the Environmental Protection Agency into an arm of the oil and gas industry, weakening environmental regulations and directly threatening the health and well-being of Maine people – something I will never stand for. #mepolitics

1258 2018-07-05 21:43:53 the guy at the oil change place asked me what oil I wanted & when I said just the regular kind he looked at me like I was crazy but like what exactly did he expect me to say 
1259 2018-07-05 21:43:47 Better than the Imperial Oil mailroom boy who was our last PM!
1260 2018-07-05 21:43:42 Valvoline drive-thru oil change— game changer. Quick and efficient.
1261 2018-07-05 21:43:38 This happened to me and turns out they didn’t even change my oil, they just hoe’d me 
1262 2018-07-05 21:43:31 friends w oily skin can any of you recommend some products to help control oil bc i’m a mess !!
1263 2018-07-05 21:43:26 Only if prayers develop a country, Nigeria would be better than US. Unemployment would be a thing of the past. We won't even need Oil. Niger Delta can drink their oil.
1264 2018-07-05 21:43:25 You're right. It had absolutely nothing to do with it. The years long oil glut dried up, pushing the price per barrel up.

Production cost is completely unchanged.
1265 2018-07-05 21:43:19 How is it a NDP crash when the crash started under the conservatives. SK Also dependent on selling oil crashed as well, and yet with AB already being richer per capita then SK and are growing faster then SK
1266 2018-07-05 21:43:10 ALBA Fully funded for HH and the 2 summer campaigns. They have more cash than they needed for this with the previous funding round. HH oil sales will offset costs also. News rich 3-6 moth period #ALBA. #HorseHill #UKOG
1267 2018-07-05 21:43:07 Can also try using tuna canned with olive oil. Gives you instant salad dressing at same time 
1268 2018-07-05 21:43:04 I dont use baby oil dear
1269 2018-07-05 21:43:00 If ever there were a reason for a tariff war
oil, coal and gas should be it
1270 2018-07-05 21:42:56 Oil industry and shorts are coordinating misinformation campaign bring too Tesla down thank you for fighting back our future depends on it
1271 2018-07-05 21:42:53 The Draconian EPA  Regulations have Stifled American Business ...Especially Hostile to the Oil and Gas Industry....which contributes So much to Our Good Lifestyle..!!!!!
1272 2018-07-05 21:42:51 Oil Supply Squeeze: Iran sanction, Venezuela finances, Libya Military coup, Mexico finances, Syncrude oilsands down Canada.

Demand side Saudi/Russia says can raise production +2MM/bbls.
But they really can't until Opec meets again w/o breaking opec rules. 
$73 WTI $77.64 Brent
1273 2018-07-05 21:42:49 I wonder if Venezuela was instead referred to as Venezuela-the-country-with- the-largest-proven-oil-reserves-in-the-world would these articles on proposed regime change by the US start to look a little less well meaning ?
1274 2018-07-05 21:42:47 Tonights Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series event in Fayetteville has been postponed until September 27th.
1275 2018-07-05 21:42:47 I’m surprised Pruitt lasted this long. What’s the next oil junkie we’ll get?
1276 2018-07-05 21:42:41 I have been a waiter, cook, dishwasher, grass mower, weed wacker, farmer, hot shot driver, oil rigger. So spare me the 'you don't know what it's like to do that' hahahaha
1277 2018-07-05 21:42:35 No that’s the Supreme Court justice nominee. The next EPA administrator will just be a literal oil drum dressed as Sarah Palin shouting drill baby drill
1278 2018-07-05 21:42:33 godspeed scott pruitt; enjoy all your oil money. 
1279 2018-07-05 21:42:06 Next EPA director is... *looks at notes that are actually just a scott pruitt cum tribute* an... anthropomorphic barrel of oil.

So everyone give Chris Christie a big round of applause.
1280 2018-07-05 21:41:58 Dang Chelsea you are on fire.
1281 2018-07-05 21:41:56 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1282 2018-07-05 21:41:55 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1283 2018-07-05 21:41:28 Don't forget his busunui, Yupon styled plush and all the new straps/overpriced event only items I have on my list. I wish I was overreacting but with current rates and shipping, all merch may almost cost me a PS4. I wish I was an oil ma(((
1284 2018-07-05 21:41:25 Your good friend is a goddamned money grubbing self-centered self-serving hypocrite who harmed tens of thousands of people with his policies as he operated within the pocket of the oil industry.
1285 2018-07-05 21:41:13 He was doing what trump's Big Oil buddies wanted him to do. Trump will choose another one with no conscience to further destroy regulations. I hope we reverse all these horrible regs when we take back the WH in 2020.
1286 2018-07-05 21:41:10 Good.  A shill for big oil.  Get somebody that is competent and actually does some good instead of working to line his and his cronies pockets.
1287 2018-07-05 21:41:07 She’s wearing that lip oil, keepin it hydrated af
1288 2018-07-05 21:41:01 That has to do with oil prices how? You people really have to focus on what is occurring NOW, while an immoral treacherous moron is president and ruining lives on a daily basis.
1289 2018-07-05 21:40:56 Soooo... I almost wrecked my truck and destroyed the Oil and Lube shop all behind a daggone .   Kinda embarrassed... but hey I'm allergic to them

1292 2018-07-05 21:40:39 Or when electric cars take over the world,oil will be worthless
1293 2018-07-05 21:40:38 Come to Miami, I got the SheaMoisture products on deck and the Argan Oil for your edges!
1294 2018-07-05 21:40:34 I totally hear you. I'd honestly love to see people like @katiepeheakoe completely divest from oil and the byproducts. Even for a day.
1295 2018-07-05 21:40:31 Go drink some oil
1296 2018-07-05 21:40:31 Ugh it'd look like motor oil

1309 2018-07-05 21:39:36 Yes! and mushrooms and anchovies (the hot oil pie w/stinger pepper is iconic and also great, though)

1311 2018-07-05 21:39:23 the MAGA folks in Oklahoma loved him for 'cut and paste' of Oil company complaints on to lawsuits against the EPA.  I'm betting they put him back in office there.

1315 2018-07-05 21:38:51 ...work just as hard as Pruitt did to dismantle the EPA so my pals from the Koch Seminar Network and big oil and coal companies can continue to lay waste to the environment because getting as rich as possible is more important than leaving a habitable planet for your children
1316 2018-07-05 21:38:29 My papaw picked my car up this morning fixed my tire, got me an oil change, and filled my car up. What more could I want 
1317 2018-07-05 21:38:07 Or a skillet and some oil
1318 2018-07-05 21:38:02 For soup, cook diced ginger in oil, then simmer with lentils, miso paste, vegetable broth and carrots. Top with mint.

1321 2018-07-05 21:37:50 No one called me or left a message so that was a lie. I go to pickup my lawnmower and they are trying to make me pay saying it wasn’t Working due to maintenance. Before I brought it in I put new gas in it oil and I even purchased new spark plugs and put it on there.
1322 2018-07-05 21:37:45 ANY GOVERNMENT IN CARICOM _ DEFENDING  OIL AND GAS IS IT FUTURE  CALL AN ELECTION _ THIS IDIOT STEP DOWN Scott Pruitt from the EPA -follow back a him
1323 2018-07-05 21:37:43 Unemployment? He's going to become a high-paid-bottom-feeding lobbyist for some oil company.
1324 2018-07-05 21:37:42 It’s like water and oil they don’t mix even though the actual idols aren’t enemies or have any hate towards one another.. it’s just the two fandoms ..
1325 2018-07-05 21:37:41 Sure. Boil any small potato (I used ratte) as you would normally. When ready, drain and return to the pan. Pour in a glug of extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper and parsley. Crush with the tablespoon and then mix well. The more you mix, the more mashy they get. Enjoy!
1326 2018-07-05 21:37:38 Finally a politician who agrees. Enough of this "renovating a refinery" bullshit. These prices are high because the oil companies want to make more money.
1327 2018-07-05 21:37:35 God bless your new age 
1328 2018-07-05 21:37:35 And that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
1329 2018-07-05 21:37:34 Where are politicians protecting consumers from price fixing. Why when oil has stay same Canadian dollars roughly Same but gasoline on market is down from May, government need to step in. And this cash cow was initiated by foreign owned companies. Lack of refineries in Alberta!
1330 2018-07-05 21:37:33 My mom just walked in the living room and squirted a whole dropper of cbd oil in my mouth without warning
1331 2018-07-05 21:37:28 Idk how y'all just be driving around with your oil light and tire lights on for weeks, months at a time. That shit is crazy.
1332 2018-07-05 21:37:14 If you work in the coal industry, or the oil industry you need to quit your jobs, you know the Democrats are trying to save the world and no sacrifice by you little people is to small
1333 2018-07-05 21:37:09 my vision is even worse rn bc i have my glasses off AND coconut oil in my eyes i’m blind rn
1334 2018-07-05 21:37:09 I strongly considered Orbi’s as well. Besides them looking like essential oil diffusers, the form factor is very appealing.

1338 2018-07-05 21:36:42 so you do know what subsidies the oil industry gets right? The fact's like? or are you still looking for more people that should be murdered like you said should be done to  @MikeHudema and @EmmaJackson57 and others?
1339 2018-07-05 21:36:36 im gonna start using tanning oil as a setting spray

He wants to end the conversation because you mentioned boobs
That's all i needed to hear

I bet he has no problem with the Half naked oil man in these games.
1342 2018-07-05 21:36:29 you've done your research I'm almost impressed,  if it wasn't for the fact we've done so much for the community ever since (never being relegated btw) and youve had Shinawatra whos basically the devil and Mansour whos family basically got their wealth thru oil and slave labour..
1343 2018-07-05 21:36:28 I make a salve out of coconut oil, tumeric and boswellia capsules and it works great but will stain fabrics - permanently.
1344 2018-07-05 21:36:17 Strategic Comms guru @fvmaisano talks all things environmental policy, including rising gas and oil prices and Scott Pruitt's departure
1345 2018-07-05 21:36:17 Though I'm not much for fast food, I've heard CFA is better than most (last I checked several years ago they did use trans fat aka hydrogenated oil in some products, however; hopefully this has since changed).
Driving a gas guzzler is still not a wise choice.
What is Hobby Lobby?
1346 2018-07-05 21:36:12 I’m glad Scott Pruit resigned but we need at least one person in the EPA who cares about our environment and global warming! Not someone who is invested in big oil.
1347 2018-07-05 21:36:07 Don’t use too much coconut oil it can make your skin break out really bad
1348 2018-07-05 21:36:02 #GrowingUpBritish Two of us sent to the “oil shop” with a can to get paraffin, yes Feckin paraffin, for the freestanding fire which had a wick! And getting 20 weights (cigarettes) for me Aunt!! #feckinchildabuse

1350 2018-07-05 21:35:54 You got oil?
1351 2018-07-05 21:35:41 Frankicense essential oil, look up cures for cancer and you will find tumeric, lemongrass tea, ginger, food grade hydrogen peroxide, BAKING SODA, dandelion root, etc, etc, etc....
1352 2018-07-05 21:35:35 I love long hot bath with baby oil in my water it’s so relaxing
1353 2018-07-05 21:35:34 everyone is off/extending their 4th celebrations and i went to work/am now waiting for an oil change. #adulting SUCKS.
1354 2018-07-05 21:35:30 My educated guess is that they don't want to open up what their real oil reserve books for Aramco & how much oil production is being unearthed via extra enhanced oil recovery techniques like water flooding
1355 2018-07-05 21:35:27 Asked the guys at the oil place to pull my car in because I was too afraid to and they did it for me. 
1356 2018-07-05 21:35:26 You don't do your own oil change? Or change your own air filter?
1357 2018-07-05 21:35:25 Because Oil & Gas trumps human lives, rights and value.
1358 2018-07-05 21:35:19 Makes great salad dressing .Used garlic oil on steak salad. Great to sauteed mushrooms for topping. During heat wave cooking dinner at 10 p.m

1365 2018-07-05 21:34:33 Let me guess.  The coal and oil industry funded this stupid ad.

If you want to save lives, jobs, and communities, get to sustainable carbon neutral energy as soon as possible!
1366 2018-07-05 21:34:30 .@BMWSanAntonio is usually the bane of my existence. wish me luck at my oil change today

1368 2018-07-05 21:34:21 Forget about Joe and Mica!  They are snake oil salesman!
1369 2018-07-05 21:34:16 So what oil industry company has already offered disgraced former EPA administrator .@EPAScottPruitt a job? Because being an unethical, immoral, criminal is not a deterrent to being hired out of the #Trump Administration #TrumpsAmerica #Resist #Trump
1370 2018-07-05 21:34:15 Coconut oil, tea tree oil, unrefined Shea butter
1371 2018-07-05 21:34:11 The person placed in charge, for now, was a lobbyist for oil companies. Think again. Drain the swamp, he said.

1375 2018-07-05 21:34:01 GorT: “sub sauce” - oil, vinegar, and herbs?

No ketchup still works for me. Seriously could go the rest of my life without it.
1376 2018-07-05 21:33:58 The audacity oil on the pan
1377 2018-07-05 21:33:52 I kind of wonder if oil doesn't go down just a little bit more I wonder if I should have sold I'm still holding
1378 2018-07-05 21:33:41 Idk this guy, but don’t test him because he will. Not that it’s that difficult to explain cooperate corruption as the world revolves around a continuous need for US banking and oil wars.
1379 2018-07-05 21:33:39 Are you aware that an environmental fee is added to the purchase of the following products: Electronics, Tires, Oil and Paint?
1380 2018-07-05 21:33:38 We should be drilling for our own oil and bankrupt every single one of the towel head countries.
1381 2018-07-05 21:33:35 Had similar problem, add bio Oil to your body lotion otloba 
1382 2018-07-05 21:33:34 My emotional state changes are giving me whiplash. Nobody cares, but then someone helps, but then its back into the same pot of boiling oil. 

Incredibly #Unstable but apparently there are no shrinks in #HamOnt. Begging for real #psychiatric care, not volunteers at crisis lines
1383 2018-07-05 21:33:32 I know my car is just upset with me. She need an oil change, a wash (interior and exterior), and some gas 
1384 2018-07-05 21:33:31 Scott's way ahead of you...the moving trucks have most likely taken all the valuables out the back door...check Ebay. So what's bets on him going to work for oil company or chicken franchise.
1385 2018-07-05 21:33:26 Mysterious ways, David.  Mysterious ways.  

Also, the Bible. I expect Rev. Jeffress will provide the necessary scriptural support:

Heb. 1:9. “therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness, and the lotion of Ritz-Carlton, above thy fellows;”
1386 2018-07-05 21:33:21 accidentally splashed oil all over my car's hot engine so it smells like burning feet now. 
1387 2018-07-05 21:33:18 We need MORE regulation.  The corrupt oil companies need demonizing!!!!!
1388 2018-07-05 21:33:08 Trust is indeed a “fragile thing,” is it not? A so-called “journalist” with absolutely ZERO integrity is the modern-day equivalent of the “snake oil salesman” of old - he’ll drown in what he’s selling, before anybody else buys it...............
1389 2018-07-05 21:33:03 Having oil in ur hair then washing it off is bloody missions
1390 2018-07-05 21:32:53 Frfr why isn’t technology advanced enough for people to send me shit. Like i need cooking oil rn, why can’t my mom just swipe on her phone and boom, cooking oil for Heather. WE.ARE.NOT.FOCUSING.ON.THE.RIGHT.THINGS
1391 2018-07-05 21:32:36 How do you look at yourself in the mirror? Your obligation is to the American people, not coal and oil. You’re not a good person.
1392 2018-07-05 21:32:36 Oil companies are not out to destroy our environment don’t be a hypocrite stop using car stop using mass transportation stop using anything with plastic in it because that uses oil to don’t use your computer anymore because that uses plastic which is made by oil OK?
1393 2018-07-05 21:32:31 Spent a whole check on Black Soap, Coconut Oil, Organic Shampoo, Tree Oil, etc.

Take care of yourself men.

1394 2018-07-05 21:32:13 God chose Trump, Lol. Pass the polluted snake oil, please...
1395 2018-07-05 21:32:07 Theve cut taxes, are slowly dismantling the regulatory state, confirming federal judges, opening up lands for drilling oil and rebuilding our military. But Trump is mean and obnoxious so let’s forfeit all of these things.
1396 2018-07-05 21:31:55 May will be hedging to bankroll some of her Hard Brexit on the back of increased oil output.
1397 2018-07-05 21:31:43 I don’t really know enough about oil platforms to comment, but this is an interesting concept to ponder
1398 2018-07-05 21:31:36 They aren't going to do anything! They are huge supporters of your campaign and you won't do anything either. Remember how fast you were to open DAPL? It was to pay back big oil! You are as corrupt as they are!
1399 2018-07-05 21:31:21 All right the Canadian oil industry is going to boom again.
1400 2018-07-05 21:30:46 He was caught jerking off and using motor oil as lube
1401 2018-07-05 21:30:39 Explain to me how drilling regulations on massive multinational oil companies hurts the economy. LOL.
1402 2018-07-05 21:30:37 He's done an outstanding job at giving our water and land rights to oil and chemical companies while he was bilking the American people out of their hard earned money?, you have no shame, no guilt, no brains. You and yours will see the inside of a prison cell...mark my words.

1405 2018-07-05 21:30:18 Trump names Shell Oil( the company, not just its CEO) as the new EPA head
1406 2018-07-05 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1407 2018-07-05 21:30:14 I have a hard time imagining the mental gymnastics needed to equate the environmental destruction of a crude oil pipeline that *will* leak & a military plane.  No one's saying we shouldn't have a military.

You're trying to "get me" on something, but rely on false equivalencies.
1408 2018-07-05 21:30:12 @AudiOfficial thanks audi for selling brand new car and providing terrible service, oil never filled up despite low level for a car only 4 months from brand new and car has issues with steering which keeps going left/right and noise coming from front passenger side wheel :(
1409 2018-07-05 21:29:55 Norway has a slush fund from oil. Scotland would have the same if they dumped the Westminster leeches, Switzerland is a rich country. What has England got? Big business will leave and this country. Look who will profit from Brexshit, those who bet  on it failing. You melt.
1410 2018-07-05 21:29:55 Still, the whole petrodollar edifice lies on OPEC – and the House of Saud– pricing oil in US dollars; as everyone needs greenbacks to buy oil, everyone needs to buy (spiraling) U.S. debt. Beijing is set to break the system – as long as it takes

1411 2018-07-05 21:29:32 Misread a "Thirsty Thursday" sign for "HIRST Thursday", so now I'm sat at Dave & Busters in my Midnight Oil tank top paying full price for Long Islands like a dumb hag
1412 2018-07-05 21:29:20 I'm a veggie. What else than beef does Alberta as to offer, Mr. @jkenney ? If it's oil, you probably need to know that AB has no coastline, being landlocked. For grain, freight train can do. Seems like high negotiation skills are more required than bragging, to export anything.
1413 2018-07-05 21:29:19 "i wonder how long it would take to turn the washington monument into an oil derrick"
1414 2018-07-05 21:29:04 Feliz cumpleaños!
1415 2018-07-05 21:28:57 Oh! I'm so sorry.  I truly hope you find him.  My dog was frantic,  and I gave her CBD oil but finally had to put her in a dark crate to protect her.
1416 2018-07-05 21:28:51 Waiting for the dealership to come and try to sell me more things for my car rn. Let me just get my free oil change pls
1417 2018-07-05 21:28:49 if your noodles are icky then you have the wrong ones and i mean you can put whatever sauce you like with them?? I love a bolognese personally or in the summer just tomato/cut mozarella with a lil olive oil & lemon
1418 2018-07-05 21:28:47 He probably has mattresses from the White House & Mar-a- lago. Don’t forget all the “campaign”. $$$$ from BIG OIL while AG of OK. True swamp rat. @RealDonad_Trump @RobWittman @AARP @SenGillibrand @seanhannity @FoxNews
1419 2018-07-05 21:28:43 Word is coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler will replace Scott Pruitt because whale oil lobbyist Captain Ahab Ceely hasn't returned from hunting the white whale.
1420 2018-07-05 21:28:35 First off I'm not your pal, the oil reserves are not infite, (that means they won't last forever) what else have you got? Imagine the tax your tiny population would have to pay to maintain what you have as part of the uk, by the way, I hope you get independence, I'd vote Yes!
1421 2018-07-05 21:28:32 Scott Pruitt was supposed to protect the environment not destroy it for money. The Trump worship was sad. God told Adam to work the land and take care of it. Not “Make sure oil and coal destroy the air because money is more important than quality of life” love & service not greed
1422 2018-07-05 21:28:23 I’ve tried oil cleanser then cream cleanser then just living with a permanent smudged smoky eye forever
1423 2018-07-05 21:28:22 Yves wiped the oil off her hands in the literal
1424 2018-07-05 21:28:22 My Thoughts( unsafe for family viewing) my prayer/ Go to Hell Mr Pruitt, of course that might be a random oil spill or polluted lake u created/  Don't let the door hit on the way out, and leave the pens ,We the American people are paying for u anymore...#ByeFelicia #ScottPruitt
1425 2018-07-05 21:28:20 Word is coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler will replace Scott Pruitt because whale oil lobbyist Captain Ahab Ceely hasn't returned from hunting the white whale.
1426 2018-07-05 21:28:18 Minnesota produces very little/no coal, natural gas, and oil. It can produce huge amounts of wind and solar. Renewable energy will bring jobs, tax revenue, and investment to Minnesota.
1427 2018-07-05 21:28:17 After moisturizing your hair with coconut oil be so relaxing & refreshing.
1428 2018-07-05 21:28:09 Like I said ...ignorant...even Saudi have started moving towards Russia for arms and oil......but keep making those tarrifs they really work....not!
1429 2018-07-05 21:27:44 Consider me as a unifying candidate for EPA Chief on the RFS issue. I total dig farms. I mean, I literally dig up farms all the time. Meanwhile, know anybody who loves to dig holes more than oil guys? ME!
1430 2018-07-05 21:27:37 Kaelyn tried to make everyone take shots of fresh linen oil that goes in a diffuser last night 
1431 2018-07-05 21:27:33 Horgan is on both sides of the fence on this one because on the one hand he's blocking AB oil and the other he's installing a tax yet whining about gouging. He has to pick a side on this because his Green Party buddies should love high gas prices.
1432 2018-07-05 21:27:33 But he speak truth when foreign owned refineries buy our oil cheap and sell gas back greedy inflated!
1433 2018-07-05 21:27:29 dear skincare brands: stop putting coconut oil in your damn moisturizers. it’s comedogenic and clogs your pores, i’m tired. i understand not everyone has a bad reaction to it but like….my god. ease up on the coconut oil
1434 2018-07-05 21:27:23 You assume there’s oil in there, could be milk
1435 2018-07-05 21:27:23 I, for one, am tickled shitless. As, I am sure, is Scott Pruitt. Of course he will be laughing from whatever high paying make work job he lands with a coal, chemical, or oil company.
1436 2018-07-05 21:27:22 Socialist countries like Venezuela are so committed to the environment that they almost completely shut down their domestic oil industry despite having the world's largest reserves. It's a real socialist success story!
1437 2018-07-05 21:27:16 Well done!
1438 2018-07-05 21:27:04 The thought of fat and oil soaked stuff literally puts me off eating all together non of the fatty stuff sou D's appetising at all

1443 2018-07-05 21:26:45 Check the ingredients of all canned and frozen items and breads. Make an alternate purchase if palm oil is listed. PLEASE!
1444 2018-07-05 21:26:39 And the next guy will be equally as anti environment. The power behind this White House are a Russian dictator whose economy runs on oil, and billionaires in their 80’s and 90’s. They have total control and don’t care about now or the future. They only want power.
1445 2018-07-05 21:26:34 I think I'm gonna get some of their rosehip oil and give it a bash. I tried bio oil on my face last year and it just blocked up all my pores unfortunately but I've heard so many people have results on things like stretch marks with it! x
1446 2018-07-05 21:26:34 Moe bloviating from Camera Hogg.

I'm fairly certain that a former oil and gas executive believes in science.
1447 2018-07-05 21:26:29 Out of the oil fire into the coal...
1448 2018-07-05 21:26:26 The governor is a disgrace.. While other states are paying an oil producing state like Bayelsa is waiting for FAAC
1449 2018-07-05 21:26:25 Oil price about to rise.

If you understand.
1450 2018-07-05 21:26:01 Make 'em drink a gallon of essential oil and they'll be immune to all illness
1451 2018-07-05 21:25:56 I done been here for almost 2 hours it don’t take that long for a oil change
1452 2018-07-05 21:25:55 Enjoying your higher energy prices like gas/heating oil because of TRUMP? He lied when he blamed OPEC! WALL ST. TRAITORS took over the CCM 3 yrs. ago. And how about the TARIFF WAR? Higher prices at Walmart?
1453 2018-07-05 21:25:50 Oh yeah you definitely throw that oil out no matter what.
1454 2018-07-05 21:25:49 Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei set out conditions in May for European powers if they want Tehran to stay in the accord, including steps by European banks to safeguard trade with Tehran and guarantees for Iranian oil sales.
1455 2018-07-05 21:25:47 I won’t be surprised if he goes to one of the oil firm he just gave some passes!
1456 2018-07-05 21:25:46 Burdensome regulations that protect our air & water? Apparently Republicans don't think that's important. They'd rather cater to big oil, coal, toxic pesticides & chemical energy companies over renewables like wind & solar.
1457 2018-07-05 21:25:45 here they do- we differentiate it. mayo is just oil, vinegar and eggs. miracle whip is what everyone else is talking abt

1462 2018-07-05 21:25:19 Nah come on it has to be mustard oil
1463 2018-07-05 21:25:07 If you can afford it, get a gas heater. Much better and cheaper than the electricity you spend running that oil heater. (At least I think it’s cheaper in the long run)
1464 2018-07-05 21:25:05 We switch to palm oil or vegetable oil nah

1475 2018-07-05 21:24:17 The EU, once Iran’s biggest oil importer, has vowed to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive without the United States by trying to keep oil and investment flowing.

1486 2018-07-05 21:23:12 Mr. President, I'm going to keep bugging you on this... Can we get back to Oil and OPEC. Will you be speaking about it at your next Rally?
Speaking of SCOTUS pick how about Ted?? #RealTruth #DefendersOfTheFaith #politics

1493 2018-07-05 21:22:38 If Iran cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, Jafari was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.

1495 2018-07-05 21:22:31 Don’t lie unless you wanted to sell off national parks, allow drilling for oil in the fragile eco system of the gulf and oceans? Risking horrible oil leaks and destruction of a fragile eco system?  #trumpLies

1497 2018-07-05 21:22:20 Getting an emissions test makes my anxiety sky rocket. Almost as bad as getting my oil changed. I hate cars
1498 2018-07-05 21:22:14 Crude oil is not the only determining factor here. In SA  is regulated, maybe this is where Silili comes in. He said we must send him, we have Sasol not dependent on opec, but still selling with same price.
1499 2018-07-05 21:22:09 Essential oil is the substance that keep the gears of bots well greased.
1500 2018-07-05 21:22:09 In May, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear program. Washington has since told countries they must stop buying Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face financial measures.
1501 2018-07-05 21:21:54 Just another 21st century snake oil salesman.
1502 2018-07-05 21:21:48 Scott "Swamp" Pruitt was allowed to stay in that Job to dismantle the E.P.A, big oil and coal will destroy the earth, nothing will change.
1503 2018-07-05 21:21:43 You prolly have major shrinkage. Castor oil works. So does wild growth oil (or whatever it’s called)
1504 2018-07-05 21:21:39 Rouhani and some senior military commanders have threatened in recent days to disrupt oil shipments from the Gulf countries if Washington tries to strangle Tehran’s exports.
1505 2018-07-05 21:21:36 Girl i have the whole thing, oil, soap, spray lol it smells like heaven
1506 2018-07-05 21:21:35 Yea my legs didn’t like that oil.
1507 2018-07-05 21:21:34 インフェルノー！
1508 2018-07-05 21:21:33 Humans r quite capable of adapting those mammal cousins of mine can't adapt like I can. I'd sooner starve 2 death than use palm oil!
1509 2018-07-05 21:21:15 I like Oil guys. Wonder if Cheney is interested. Heck maybe we could find a Nuclear energy guy. Even better.
1510 2018-07-05 21:21:14 perfume, castor oil, Jamaican oil, shea butter etcetera
1511 2018-07-05 21:21:12 Have the oil ready big boy
1512 2018-07-05 21:21:12 Also, 4 instance a lot of “Muslims” seem 2 be totally retarded WRT the Yahood. If Zion’s puppet America were 2 wage a Zio-Crusade against Iran, it’s not b/c of “racist” whites OR oil. It’s b/c of Zion & #GreaterIsrael. The US like most western countries is a colony of Zion (#ZOG)
1513 2018-07-05 21:21:09 Glad to finally have gotten my baby an oil change after my long adventure
1514 2018-07-05 21:21:02 Honestly don’t think you can beat McDonald’s when they are fresh. The crack they add to the oil makes them unbeatable.
1515 2018-07-05 21:21:01 I'm with Sam on this one. You're selling snake oil here.
1516 2018-07-05 21:20:53 Word is coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler will replace Scott Pruitt because whale oil lobbyist Captain Ahab Ceely hasn't returned from hunting the white whale.
1517 2018-07-05 21:20:53 I go with 3 weeks.  I’m sure the oil industry already has something lined up for the crook.
1518 2018-07-05 21:20:50 Why does it feel like 
Pruit and trump are just drooling over the oil reserves under arctic ice?
1519 2018-07-05 21:20:44 Word is coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler will replace Scott Pruitt because whale oil lobbyist Captain Ahab Ceely hasn't returned from hunting the white whale.
1520 2018-07-05 21:20:39 Every year our garden produces the tomatoes & basil for my favorite salad....caprese. Have some solid olive oil & Balsamic. Not sure I’ve attempted any other salads?
1521 2018-07-05 21:20:39 - not gonna happen. Oil topped 6/22 Dec $CLZ18 ,negative basis all over the world. #oilprice
1522 2018-07-05 21:20:35 It's Trump that is driving gas prices higher, nothing to do with OPEC. WE damn well pump and refine our own friggin oil, tell your buddies to REDUCE PRICING NOW. Psst, those prices are gonna hurt your V8 pickup truck driving base.
1523 2018-07-05 21:20:33 I've had one do that a long way from home, had to take the chainset off. Covered in oil and pissed off with an hour's ride home.
1524 2018-07-05 21:20:33 An outstanding job?  Maybe for the oil industry.  Plus He was robbing taxpayers blind. Make him reimburse the tax dollars he stole from us.
1525 2018-07-05 21:20:28 How do these idiots think they will be able to breathe when the air is completely polluted, or have clean water? They can't breathe or drink the money they are making off the coal and oil companies.
1526 2018-07-05 21:20:24 Well when CNN International is your world ambassador...
1527 2018-07-05 21:20:17 Following the resignation of Pruitt as head of the EPA, Liddle Twit appointed Pruitt's deputy, a lobbyist for the oil industry.  Now, you know what's wrong in D.C. ... @realDonaldTrump
1528 2018-07-05 21:20:17 The U.S. Navy stands ready to ensure free navigation and the flow of commerce, the U.S. military’s Central Command said on Thursday, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned they would block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if necessary.
1529 2018-07-05 21:20:05 Is this really how Christians behave? A smarmy snake oil lying thief.
1530 2018-07-05 21:20:04 Word is coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler will replace Scott Pruitt because whale oil lobbyist Captain Ahab Ceely hasn't returned from hunting the white whale.
1531 2018-07-05 21:20:00 It highlights oil industry:

1532 2018-07-05 21:19:59 @antoni does olive oil ever go bad
1533 2018-07-05 21:19:58 Big oil runs this country.
1534 2018-07-05 21:19:49 Was it the pay to play with oil industry, or defending rights of corporati
1535 2018-07-05 21:19:34 He looks like OIL CAN HARRY.
1536 2018-07-05 21:19:31 thanks girl!!! i’ll try the castor oil but i don’t trust myself enough to do them myself
1537 2018-07-05 21:19:23 I have a beard oil for this! So relaxing!
1538 2018-07-05 21:19:22 Do we know if his replacement believes in global warming or is another oil industry lackey?
1539 2018-07-05 21:19:15 Yes. If there’s a more vile, reprehensible, in the pocket of big oil and gas, slimy, anti climate, anti environment, self important, unintelligent, misinformed, misguided, morally bankrupt, cafeteria Christian, then by God Trump and his Confederacy of Dunces will find him or her.
1540 2018-07-05 21:19:15 Went to get my oil changed today. Had a $50 gift card. Went to use it, fine print said not for Oil Changes. Ok no big deal. Asked woman in lobby if she was getting oil change. She said “no, radiator “. I offered her the card. She declined. World is crawling with weirdos.
1541 2018-07-05 21:19:14 Hi there! Greetings. Sorry to bump into you. We are suppliers of medical marijuana for both patients and stoners. Herms, Oils and Canabis oil for cancer and Hernia chronic pains and other illnesses. Hit us back if interested in anything. Thanks
Interested??
1542 2018-07-05 21:19:12 The head of the EPA should always have been someone who believes in science and in protecting the air, water and land of this country.  @ScottPruittOK used the EPA as a way to benefit himself and his oil and gas buddies #byescott
1543 2018-07-05 21:19:10 hard girl hard girl calm down soon your dad will exchange you for tubers of yam and 5litres of red oil and palm wine

1545 2018-07-05 21:19:03 We might not run out of Oil in the nearest future but
*Demad for crude oil will diminish in the world market, as clean & renewable energy will be preferable 
*If the party that wields power in 2019 focus on Agriculture,technical Education & healthcare we might emancipate
1546 2018-07-05 21:18:58 The USA Should Stop Fooling Around With These Nation That Are Bossing Us Around With The Oil! Like OPEC! Institute Our Own Oil 50 State Cartel! Or Colonize The The Whole Bloody World!Institute Our Laws In Every Nation And Enforce Them Stridentually! Like Prince Machiavelli Would!
1547 2018-07-05 21:18:47 Maybe you should research the reclamation efforts of the oil sands.  Environment protection is front and centre for and pre and post development
1548 2018-07-05 21:18:45 Was it the pay to play with oil industry,or defending rights of corporati
1549 2018-07-05 21:18:16 Let’s start by allowing coal and oil companies to destroy public land that trump decided no longer need protected. Then add the plan to install offshore rigs up the US seaboard (that always releases oil into the ocean/gulf. There’s two, but they’re a BIG two
1550 2018-07-05 21:18:08 That the British working class are willing to put their trust in such an obvious snake oil salesman like Levant is the very reason why they're consistently fucked over
1551 2018-07-05 21:18:07 When you crave the potatoes from @AmericanBounty that came with the steak w/ chili oil & your boyfriend knows how to make them  #BestBoyfriendEVER
1552 2018-07-05 21:18:07 While the squeaky wheel may get the oil, it’s still a busted wheel. Careful not to lump all into the category of the one who needs to be discarded with the rest of the garbage.

1555 2018-07-05 21:17:57 "This is your culture, son."
-Me in 20 years, pointing at an oil painting of a man on couch eating cereal with ladle.
1556 2018-07-05 21:17:55 there is nothing ethical or clean about oil which was the focus of this protest :)
1557 2018-07-05 21:17:50 Big oil strikes again.
1558 2018-07-05 21:17:38 At least you didn’t buy the oil yourself thinking you could change it ya damn self  I’m in the hole $30 now. I tried looking up how and half way in I’m takin body parts off the whole whip, no thanks Lolll

1562 2018-07-05 21:17:32 ヤダヤダヤダヤダ
1563 2018-07-05 21:17:32 Oil Changes are a scam. I’m convinced. #AmIGrownYet
1564 2018-07-05 21:17:30 Ryan Zinke is another swampy asshole. He's been selling off thousands of acres of public land. He has given rights for oil drilling and development on national reserve territory. It would be naive to think that he's not making deals that fill his pockets.
1565 2018-07-05 21:17:29 Didn’t you recently say America was energy independent from the world? If America is producing enough oil for their own use, then why would you care how much oil the rest of the world produces?
1566 2018-07-05 21:17:27 You might want to explain that to Beijing who is rapidly increasing oil imports and infrastructure builds and Russia who  is spending 10s of billions on exploration and infrastructure. There is 500 years of oil reserves left.
1567 2018-07-05 21:17:22 Pruitt has done more detrimental damage than most anyone.  He had only big oil and the Koch-ness monsters bribes and motives in mind. The puppet strings were heavy.
1568 2018-07-05 21:17:16 Umm the gas price won’t go down you do understand that?The oil companies will just have bigger profits.
1569 2018-07-05 21:17:11 Don't forget we'll have all White Label Extracts at 50% off all day for 7/10! Come say hi and stock up on great oil!
1570 2018-07-05 21:17:08 Now IRAN...IRAN...  is telling DT TO BE MORE POLITE!!! Is that PRICELESS? DT bs is “driving up OIL PRICES!!!”  So Fellow Resistance...we are NOT delusional or nit picky or crazy when WE OBJECT to the language, tone, and attitude the “great negotiator” uses with USA and others!
1571 2018-07-05 21:17:02 So EPA boss, former oil industry lobbyist Scott Pruitt, resigns. To be replaced by former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler. The disastrous implications of the Trump administration will be felt for decades to come. Worldwide.
1572 2018-07-05 21:16:59 So you'd support #Indyref2  then, so we can be free of the unelected tyranny of Westminster? Because nearly every Brexit argument works for Scottish Independence too. Unless you are after our oil and fisheries.
1573 2018-07-05 21:16:59 Don't think it was an issue, more likely they know they forgot to refill the oil or found something they dropped in the engine and wanted to keep that quiet. Engines don't throw rods unless they're really old or lose oil pressure
1574 2018-07-05 21:16:57 Pruitt was working for the oil and coal industries. The next guy will be the same. Wake up.
1575 2018-07-05 21:16:52 Pruitt was nothing but a big oil crook..best news I'VE heard in awhile. .another Trumpkins bites the dust.  Now Zinke can follow suit. Then king blowhard the first..resign. go to jail do not pass go
1576 2018-07-05 21:16:51 Chef Skinner cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with toast.
1577 2018-07-05 21:16:38 Tesla is good for coal industry, gets oil replaced by coal, make up of grid power is public knowledge and increase net electric consumption is demand for grid
1578 2018-07-05 21:16:37 Scott Pruitt didn't turn into a corrupt unethical SOB on arrival in DC. Hopefully some good investigative reporters are looking into his history in OK. Good riddance to him. Thoughts & prayers for his future; most likely as an oil & gas lobbyist.
1579 2018-07-05 21:16:35 does the number flow like crude oil?.  NTA check grammar before you tweet.
1580 2018-07-05 21:16:27 @realDonaldTrump Didn't have The Backbone to Fire Pruitt, can't man up enough to even criticize Big Oil Implant #ScottPruitt under a record 12 Ethic Investigations. But a scarey WOMAN holding a baby, stood up to him in restaurant & The Cowardly SwampMaster Resigned. #NastyWomen!
1581 2018-07-05 21:16:25 I’ve shaved oh, just started growing again, started with the oil 2 weeks ago, but before then Na sheabutter I dey use
1582 2018-07-05 21:16:23 I need to go get an oil change but I don’t wanna wait  someone pick me up and drop me back off when it’s ready  lolol
1583 2018-07-05 21:16:22 @CJPSaqibNisar one of the most important issue in Karachi that transporters of big oil tankerswho load petroleum and other chemicals clean their tanks by young children, they drop child of 10 12 years age into tanker and use them to clean inside tank, in many cases they died
1584 2018-07-05 21:16:18 Anybody got some olive oil or a crowbar or something?
1585 2018-07-05 21:16:17 I thought he got "The king" to increase oil production last week? What's the problem Joey? Why no cheap gas?
1586 2018-07-05 21:16:11 Odanz, do you bath with water like us or with Oil?
1587 2018-07-05 21:16:07 I’m not knwdgble about home heating options in this particular remote comm, but I know in others there’s a big trend in switching from wood/oil heat to elec heat (despite more expsive) due 2 aging demog, and reduce maintenance. Triggers upgrades in elec infra, subsidized by 1/2
1588 2018-07-05 21:16:06 I truly couldn't pass judgement, but I am sure many thousand of oil wells are in the vicinity of faults (as they create quite good oil & gas reservoirs), so the question could be asked are any wells wise? Very few quakes are caused by oil extraction so the risk is worth taking.
1589 2018-07-05 21:16:01 Word is coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler will replace Scott Pruitt because whale oil lobbyist Captain Ahab Ceely hasn't returned from hunting the white whale.
1590 2018-07-05 21:15:48 I do a super basic thing with sliced baguette, Brie, prosciutto, olive oil, sun dried tomato, and pepper in the oven for a few minutes and it always pleases my wife.
1591 2018-07-05 21:15:43 Maybe oil is made out of foil
1592 2018-07-05 21:15:31 You do not even know for what you is talking. Relief sanctions, adopt bebies, buy more oil!
1593 2018-07-05 21:15:28 If by "protecting our natural environment" you mean "selling off the commons to extraction industries", then you'll get what you're asking for. Might want to warn the tourism industry in your state that the oil rigs will obstruct the beach views.
1594 2018-07-05 21:15:22 They can't afford it now with the low Oil price, NA  Money hen

Serve over rice if desired
1597 2018-07-05 21:14:55 What worked for me is just using castor oil and doing my eyebrows myself, bc they always get too thin 
1598 2018-07-05 21:14:54 That's a good point.

I am wrong. 

I was focused on the wars we wage for oil without the consent of our legislatures.

My mistake. I'm sorry.
1599 2018-07-05 21:14:49 Washed my car, got an oil change, and filled my tank. Life’s great.

1609 2018-07-05 21:14:10 I think we are close to where oil tops for good. When I see charts for oil companies heading lower, and airlines heading higher, I begin to pay attention real close.

1615 2018-07-05 21:13:30 He always wanted to be a Wartime President. First thing, "ATTACK THE OIL!" He'll get around to it. He's picked a fight with everyone else.
1616 2018-07-05 21:13:28 We have real cheap gas here because of all the oil wells and shit like that

1618 2018-07-05 21:13:18 China is investing in green technologies and Russia has gas. It's definitely not the Oil what's first on their agenda. Big Oil is a dead horse.

1623 2018-07-05 21:13:03 Tips,,,
-Don’t bleach/color it. 
-Don’t wash it every day, wash it about 2 times a week. 
-Brush your hair every day.
-Put coconut oil on your scalp. Don’t put it in every day. Maybe once a week. 
-Get frequent trims.
-Avoid heat styling tools.
1624 2018-07-05 21:13:02 Retweeted Robert Reich (@RBReich):

Quite apart from his hand lotion and tactical pants, Pruitt has done immeasurable damage to the planet, endangering our children and grandchildren. History will remember him as a Big Oil toady.
1625 2018-07-05 21:12:52 To hell with economical sense when the wheels are falling off the bus.

Yes, the larger oil and gas cos saw the writing on the wall and were pro-active on the tax front — because it doesn’t mean that much to them. They remain a force though.
1626 2018-07-05 21:12:47 Very interesting Jamie, thanks for sharing your thoughts. Drilling for oil is proposed nearby (Leith Hill) is that wise when there is such movement currently?
1627 2018-07-05 21:12:46 NYC is a shit hole – just a more expensive version of northern Jersey, without the oil refineries…
1628 2018-07-05 21:12:46 Yes polluting our air and water is such a great thing for America!! What a absolute ridiculous idea it was to hire this POS that is owned by the oil industry. Glad he’s gone but the problem still remains with YOUR POLICIES! One monster down one more to go.
1629 2018-07-05 21:12:44 Ya' think? #CorruptGOP I guess everyone got what they needed out of him & GOP Russian team got all their guarantees for RUSSIAN oil & gas work in their home states. GOP IS DISGUSTING. You give the good people in the GOP shame. @realdonaldtrump GOP & Trump = cancer on our Country.
1630 2018-07-05 21:12:31 LMFAO . I hope he goes bankrupt paying for lawyers. Knowing him, he’s already arranged for the oil and gas industries to pay his bills

In the meantime, we need SAFE ways of transporting oil. Without pipelines its gonna come through on trucks!
1637 2018-07-05 21:12:00 Scott Pruitt wasn't the guy for that job, easily bought by big oil.
1638 2018-07-05 21:11:58 i’m obsessed with perfumes&body oil  i can’t/won’t stop buying them
1639 2018-07-05 21:11:43 happy birthday bro
1640 2018-07-05 21:11:37 Just a guess but I bet it’s so Russian oil can compete.
1641 2018-07-05 21:11:35 Love them, sometimes use the oil for flavouring...
1642 2018-07-05 21:11:33 Let me rub oil on my hand..  you will see how your cheek will be sounding like ATM

1644 2018-07-05 21:11:21 Congratulations to Scott Pruitt on his new job on the board of directors of the Connex-Killen Oil Company!
1645 2018-07-05 21:11:20 my dumbass didn’t know you had to dilute tea tree oil before using it & now my skin all dry
1646 2018-07-05 21:11:18 Oops...
Theor=their
 I meant, last year it was net EXPORTER of oil
1647 2018-07-05 21:11:11 Here we go from domestic terror to oil?
1648 2018-07-05 21:11:11 Whoever replaces Pruitt will continue with the destruction of our air, forest and waterways. Those are the orders of the oil and coal barons and, Trump and Republicans do what they want!
1649 2018-07-05 21:11:01 For oil and gas, converting methane more into useful chemicals made from crude oil today, less into coke or CO2.
1650 2018-07-05 21:11:00 Sliced summer squash, asparagus, sliced fingerling eggplant, onions, stuffed portabella mushrooms.
I put some Pasolivo orange/olive oil and Penzey's Trinidad spice mix in a gallon baggie, add vegies and let them sit until the meat's nearly done, then throw them on the grill.
1651 2018-07-05 21:10:55 i put olive oil in my hair and now i feep like the Fonz
#HEEEEEEEEEYYYY
1652 2018-07-05 21:10:44 "The oil slicks I knew" by S. Pruitt.
1653 2018-07-05 21:10:39 RepubliCONS and extreme BIG OIL CON MEN call it deregulation. What it really is Fraud, and Treason. They openly collude with OPEC/TERRORIST to drive gasoline prices higher and use the USA government to take down competition with frivolous regulations on EV'/TESLA/Renewable Energy
1654 2018-07-05 21:10:33 When you make an apt and you still have to wait an unacceptable amount of time. It's just an oil change guys.
1655 2018-07-05 21:10:29 Just because we have a title & position in the Kingdom doesn’t give us special privileges. The Alabaster Box of oil used to anoint Jesus Christ for burial costed the woman a years wages. No shortcuts and no half price sales. It cost everything. Amen  Pastor Pat.
1656 2018-07-05 21:10:28 Wait, what? Are you implying the oil industry is good for the environment? Surely I misunderstood your tweet...?
1657 2018-07-05 21:10:28 Big oil’s got nothin’ to worry about.
1658 2018-07-05 21:10:26 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
1659 2018-07-05 21:10:24 @BachmanChevy had appt at 9 am for oil change...nearly 8 hours later truck finally looked at, what’s the point of an appt when you wait nearly 8 hours to be seen??? not happy!!!! @chevrolet
1660 2018-07-05 21:10:24 Interestingly the Wall Street Journal reported last month that  some of the competing industrialists ie ethanol weren’t pleased and wanted him out also. Nice to see him booted but his replacement will be a literal oil rig
1661 2018-07-05 21:10:22 Jamie olive oil
1662 2018-07-05 21:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Cool #Whip this July? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!
1663 2018-07-05 21:10:06 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
1664 2018-07-05 21:10:05 @Yusetpozo chip stocks,if the soxl is up buy UCTT on pullback,the oil sector stinks
1665 2018-07-05 21:10:03 I was talkin mad ish about how my baby daddy ain’t shit then he goes and pays for me a front end allignment, oil change, & 2 new tires. What a great man lmao.
1666 2018-07-05 21:09:52 Sorry to see him go said the oil leak. He was a good friend ...one I'll also forget...gotta take care of the shareholders
1667 2018-07-05 21:09:34 Again before Klopp came here we were a middle of the table club. That’s a fact. 

Building takes time unless of course you want oil money. That’s never going to happen. 

What’s your answer if we don’t win anything? Sack Klopp?
1668 2018-07-05 21:09:28 Right. I wouldn't use butter. What did you use - olive oil, margerine?
1669 2018-07-05 21:09:05 Probably not. Trump is bought by oil, coal and gas
1670 2018-07-05 21:08:59 No, not really. We need to provide businesses with incentives to build more efficient vehicles and move away from fossil fuels altogether over time, and we need to stop subsidizing oil companies over solar, wind, and nuclear companies. LED lights need to replace fluorescents etc
1671 2018-07-05 21:08:57 Rising oil prices. Says so right in the report.  I suggest Alberta is doing well “in spite of” the tax...not because of it, as you alllude. Unless you have evidence showing carbon taxes as a net boost to Alberta’s ability to produce more oil, and get said oil to market? #ableg
1672 2018-07-05 21:08:55 FYI The first solar powered machine was in 1865 by a French math instructer/inventor - a sophisticated ice cream maker in July - only to have initial money investors bail for oil. He was concerned that world was too dependent on coal.
Altruistic Visionaries are virtually extinct
1673 2018-07-05 21:08:53 you have an 8 BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT! 

Sales tax would provide $3 to 4B. Income tax increase to cdn average prob bring in another $2B.

Another half billion eliminating big oil subsidies. 

The rest thru royalty increases.

Balanced!
1674 2018-07-05 21:08:44 should I do a painting stream sometime this week? (today? idk) *actual paint, like, the messy oil shit)
1675 2018-07-05 21:08:37 Uhhhhhi need cooking oil or imma starve, send help
1676 2018-07-05 21:08:36 Blakemore Vineyards: Mango, pineapple and apricot. Rosemary olive oil and more. Three crisp Charlotte's Home sauvignon with cocoa
1677 2018-07-05 21:08:35 And US to soon be worlds largest oil producer. Yes he did so much good while left w biggest mess to start with.
1678 2018-07-05 21:08:28 When i get stressed i love to pray listen to music, take/edit pics, read, go for a walk, basically anything that gets me off of soical media and do something. Also use my stress away essential oil.
1679 2018-07-05 21:08:18 Finally draining the swamp, giving us dirty water, dirty air and dirty oil. You people just keep making #America weak. 
@Plot2Destroy
1680 2018-07-05 21:08:16 Happy Birthday Engineer @oil_shaeikh! I wish you all the good things you wish for yourself!
1681 2018-07-05 21:08:16 im pissed looking and reading those twts that makes me wanna straight up post a tweet too but no it's not cowardly, i don't wanna add more oil to the fire they created.
1682 2018-07-05 21:08:14 He’s already got another Oil Toady in place.
1683 2018-07-05 21:08:13 Every time someone I know is new to keto, they ask where I get my MCT oil. To which I have to ask, "what MCT oil?" 
Where did this keto/MCT association come from?
1684 2018-07-05 21:08:12 EZ shares +0.8%, US shares +0.9% (hopes for a last min reprieve from US/China tariffs to start at 2pm Syd time today, or buy on the fact?)

1685 2018-07-05 21:08:09 An Oil Exec would be my guess.
1686 2018-07-05 21:08:04 I’m an avid hero eater lmao it will have you full and you can save it for later or eat it the next day from the fridge & the bread won’t ever be soggy from oil/vinegar/lettuce/tomatoes... it brings tears to my eyes
1687 2018-07-05 21:07:58 The problem the fellow taking over is a POS oil lobbyist.  We're still screwed.
1688 2018-07-05 21:07:51 Your party turned a blind eye to his corruption so he would gut the agency for the coal and oil industries.
1689 2018-07-05 21:07:50 That's not the reason why. Chinese and Russian investment in oil remains huge.
1690 2018-07-05 21:07:43 I currently have a mini container of Vaseline, 3 blue Chapsticks & a coconut oil EOS in my purse to keep my lips moist.
1691 2018-07-05 21:07:42 We don't really know why Pruitt resigned suddenly,but killing the EPA, and deal making with oil,gas and coal wasn't the reason.
1692 2018-07-05 21:07:40 I’m on a plane and this old white hut across the aisle has like ashy scabby skin. And I know his doc prob prescribed him like 70 medications and told him he has psoriasis but honestly I feel like some coconut oil will get that shit right
1693 2018-07-05 21:07:34 What do you mean USA is not affected when theor gas prises go up too?
Btw, the USA has a lot of oil. Some time last year to was a net EXPORTER, yes it selling oil to the rest of the world.
Anyway,  Saudi Arabia almost always drop their prices when they sell to the USA.
1694 2018-07-05 21:07:33 The big oil donors wanted him to stay.  It's that simple.
1695 2018-07-05 21:07:27 Away with the rubbish Scotland is wealthy we have oil and WM mismanaged that . Get the facts pal.
1696 2018-07-05 21:07:24 SCOTT was afraid that the unknown meetings would be revealed as oil lobbyists, coal execs, and employment opportunities for wifey.
No good person
1697 2018-07-05 21:07:09 THANK YOU FOR RESIGNING...you managed to cost us taxpayers plenty of money for NOTHING. Go live off ur ridiculous oil money. #liar
1698 2018-07-05 21:07:03 Wen yu go in for a simple oil change & tune up & they find extra shit wrong
1699 2018-07-05 21:06:58 Happy HAPPY Dance for Mama Nature.!!! Goodbye Pruitt!!! Please please Please no oil execs and science disclaiming replacement! 
1700 2018-07-05 21:06:54 Coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler is apparently the replacement, because no whale oil lobbyists were available.
1701 2018-07-05 21:06:40 Has anyone ever used Bio Oil for their acne scars and such? 
1702 2018-07-05 21:06:36 His replacement is a freaking oil lobbyist... we are doomed 
1703 2018-07-05 21:06:33 Most likely these oil & coal corporations will offer him a job so he can continue to damage OUR planet. We hope he got the message!!! 
#EnvironmentFirst before profit!!!
1704 2018-07-05 21:06:31 Feel like my coconut oil on this weather, fucking melting away.
1705 2018-07-05 21:06:21 Centers on a congressman who is tasked with saving the world after gravity is erased from North Dakota oil boom country.
1706 2018-07-05 21:06:16 I'll bring the coconut oil.
1707 2018-07-05 21:06:11 Ethanol has a chance now that big oil is out of your pocket?
1708 2018-07-05 21:06:07 Just because we have a title & position in the Kingdom doesn’t give us special privileges. The Alabaster Box of oil used to anoint Jesus Christ for burial costed the woman a years wages. No shortcuts and no half price sales. It cost everything.
1709 2018-07-05 21:06:05 Max d'C:
Hope you all remembered to have a quick shower befur jumping in the pool?
If not, we'll see the rainbow trail of suntan oil behind you!  #keepfits
1710 2018-07-05 21:06:02 I need to get a oil change pronto
1711 2018-07-05 21:05:35 Indications are Scotland will be allowed to join because they need our fish, oil, whisky etc but even if we have to go the Norwegian route surely that’s better than being thurled to the Tories?
1712 2018-07-05 21:05:34 It doesn't have to happen overnight, but the question is what directions we take. There is no oil shortage; that's a myth. Meanwhile, solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen, and other alternatives are available.  It's a process, but not one that fracking helps.
1713 2018-07-05 21:05:24 Mistress Monday,. Let your side wench borrow some oil for her candles, and some eggs #1776Twitter
1714 2018-07-05 21:05:16 …with cans of oil, hanging from the rear bumper, holes intentionally drilled in them, leaking out quarts of black gold a minute…to own the libs.
1715 2018-07-05 21:05:15 I came for an oil change...ONLY an oil change!! Please stop telling me everything wrong with my car, it’s depressing 
1716 2018-07-05 21:05:15 I know...right? But that's what lying, grifting, political hacks like the bible-thumping snake oil salesman from Oklahoma do.
1717 2018-07-05 21:05:12 You will have oil & grease instead .
1718 2018-07-05 21:05:12 A CBD oil company just commented 'nice' on an old selfie on Instagram. What are they trying to achieve
1719 2018-07-05 21:05:07 Oh, I fully expect the replacement will be, like, a literal barrel of oil in a necktie
1720 2018-07-05 21:05:04 And a few years after France bombed Libya and is still holding its oil fields.
1721 2018-07-05 21:05:02 Meanwhile, thanks to President Trump, the USA is becoming one of the biggest oil PRODUCERS in the world.  GONE are the days when we were dependent on foreign oil.  Doesn't it feel good?  :-)
1722 2018-07-05 21:05:02 A marriage without grace and forgiveness is like an engine without oil. It's only a matter of time before it seizes up and quits.
1723 2018-07-05 21:05:02 Gun oil counts as cologne right?
1724 2018-07-05 21:05:00 here's my real hot take of the evening: it doesn't matter what fast food chain has the "best fries" because fries aren't good. they taste of nothing but oil.
1725 2018-07-05 21:04:58 good riddance to the corrupt toxic disaster that was #ScottPruitt... But just because he's out doesn't mean the EPA doesn't have its own superfund cleanup ahead. Pruitt poisoned boards with climate deniers, oil & coal execs, and eliminated key scientists - they all must go too!
1726 2018-07-05 21:04:52 Your assertion that history will remember #ScottPruitt as a Big Oil toady is based on the bold assumption that there will be anyone left to remember him after the full effects of his policies hit.
1727 2018-07-05 21:04:47 There are oil interests in Venezuela, therefore self-interest in the U.S.
1728 2018-07-05 21:04:37 The oil (Brent Crude) price is $77, the reason is not easy to pin down.
1729 2018-07-05 21:04:33 Trump is going to select an actual oil refinery to replace Pruitt.

Today, #British oil company Soco International has been given permission to drill in Virunga National Park in the #Congo, home of critically endangered Mountain Gorilla. Last month 6 Rangers died defending the #gorillas. We must stop this. RT to start
1732 2018-07-05 21:04:13 Couple of years back oil prices were beyond 100$ per barrel. The  was never this high. The oil price fel to its lowest and the petrol prices never followed. Compare to other countries including those buying from SA,  is cheaper. Unfortunately his company benefit from increase
1733 2018-07-05 21:03:56 Nah. I think we're trading an oil baron for a coal baron. :-(
1734 2018-07-05 21:03:56 Made a joke once. Keep in mind, I'm a ground fighter, you'll probably get your oil checked, Oh & before we fight, should probably agree on a safe word? Shut him up for a couple weeks. Told him I'd give him the opportunity to punch me in the face? Need liability waiver first!
1735 2018-07-05 21:03:54 This guy will give big oil the playground they desire. It’s bad.

1737 2018-07-05 21:03:49 @realDonaldTrump Texas oil terrorists are exporting record amounts of oil and prices are at 4 year highs, thought those pipelines were going to lower prices. Why haven’t you put in place an oil export ban to get these prices under control?
1738 2018-07-05 21:03:43 He must be done sucking your ____, so he’s off to take a crude oil bath.
1739 2018-07-05 21:03:42 I don't think EPA is dependent on oil companies. IT's just that government needs good relationships with oil companies. Oil is needed for energy. Like it or not. Is your life free of oil products and derivates 100%? No right. Get real.
1740 2018-07-05 21:03:37 Dog do not like fireworks, there is a such thing as CBD oil for dogs to help with the affects of fireworks @BPShow #BPShow
1741 2018-07-05 21:03:24 Just got my Black Seed Oil in the mail. Let’s see what this is about
1742 2018-07-05 21:03:17 Those 7 GOP guys in Moscow. Kansas, Texas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, all have existing Keystone oil pipelines, or are states slated for Keystone XL extension. Louisiana & Alabama have major oil & gas deepwater ports
1743 2018-07-05 21:03:16 No, big oil guy, climate change denier.
1744 2018-07-05 21:02:53 rosehip oil is so nice
1745 2018-07-05 21:02:51 let him know the oil deal is going as planned.
1746 2018-07-05 21:02:51 Lots of people should worry about this before the USN: China, Japan, South Korea, Iraq, KSA, UAE for starters. Build pipelines around the strait, use friction-reducing agents in existing ones, oil stocks outside the Gulf, a multinational force that includes the major importers...
1747 2018-07-05 21:02:49 I was honestly thinking something much more elemental and unresponsive, like the flaming oil rig from There Will Be Blood

1757 2018-07-05 21:01:45 In addition to his 15 open ethics investigations, Scott Pruitt should have resigned because he was dismantling our environmental protections at the behest of oil & gas companies. 

Little policy will change under Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist himself.
1758 2018-07-05 21:01:25 @SenSchumer 

DO NOT allow Democrats to vote for #Pruit replacement unless the nominee admits climate change is real, clean air and water are necessary and the EPA does not wine and dine the oil industry.
1759 2018-07-05 21:01:24 what’s the best tea tree oil to use on your skin?
1760 2018-07-05 21:00:54 Gotta enjoy this brief post-Pruitt window before the next EPA administrator comes on and announces they want to use the Great Lakes to store oil or whatever
1761 2018-07-05 21:00:52 US was exporting excess oil during Obama presidency...and solar was booming too...not so much now
1762 2018-07-05 21:00:37 Watch the tools, (including Bibi and Trump) blame Iran for the price increase. Funny, if Trump owned the oil, he’d say I’m charging what the market will bear. But when someone else does it, they’re evil.  Funny man, that Trump is.

1765 2018-07-05 21:00:28 I think the leading candidate would be 400,000 barrels of radioactive spilled oil.
1766 2018-07-05 21:00:27 July 05, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1767 2018-07-05 21:00:19 Sung to Ain't No Sunshine: "Ain't no sunshine when the oil's gone; only uncertainty every day. Ain't no sunshine when it's gone, you know they gotta hold on - to all the power - they got today..." #politicalrisk
1768 2018-07-05 21:00:19 Pruitt was just as corrupt while AG in Oklahoma . . . a red state hugged him because he backed oil interests and occasionally thumped a bible.
He was selected to dismantle the EPA  . . . 
He's a sorry excuse for a human . . .
1769 2018-07-05 21:00:17 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1770 2018-07-05 21:00:11 Why should OPEC listen to you?  You placed sanctions on Iran and threatened other countries if they traded with them.  Iran, an OPEC member, is the 3rd largest producer of oil.  Enjoy!!!
1771 2018-07-05 21:00:10 That’s good to know! Thank you! I went to a store in Washington called huckleberries and you could get olive oil, lotion, kombucha and a bunch of other stuff. I wish we could have more of that here 
1772 2018-07-05 20:59:27 And you have a degree in economics, oil responds to the demand and supply of global markets. Did you miss that class; ecom 101.
1773 2018-07-05 20:59:17 I had to buy special face wash for mine. Under my chin was rough, and wirey. Beard oil would probably help the roughness
1774 2018-07-05 20:59:15 Pruitt might as well have been a coal or oil lobbyist.
1775 2018-07-05 20:59:15 I'm interested to see which oil lobbyist the Cheeto-in-Chief picks to head the EPA now that comically corrupt Scott Pruitt is out.
1776 2018-07-05 20:59:08 Sorry But your Wrong1st its an old white guy. 2nd he’s not bringing in pizza but leaving w/ a bag of cash for the oil ind.
1777 2018-07-05 20:58:59 
Grandmom oil?
Maybe squeeze the jizz out of his stained mattresses? 
I d k !
1778 2018-07-05 20:58:59 Sure but I think Mexico was still stable then, and it was in 70's when the oil crisis hit that things started to go south. And then in the early 90's there was hyperinflation in Mexico and that hurt the country a lot. Mexico also got VERY corrupt as we all know.
1779 2018-07-05 20:58:57 Since last Friday on my last day of our holiday,my ears have been totally blocked in the left and other one partly. I can not hear a thing. I have to keep putting Olive oil in my ears for another week before they will syringe. Jolly peed off
1780 2018-07-05 20:58:54 Aahhh I'm trapped at oil change place with 27% battery haha.
1781 2018-07-05 20:58:48 Did he get to keep the Trump Mattress? Did his wife get her Chick-fil-A Franchise?Pruitt comes from a conservative brand of Christianity that interprets the Bible as sanctioning human exploitation of oil, gas, and coal, which are seen as gifts from God for man’s benefit @maddow
1782 2018-07-05 20:58:46 @CNBCClosingBell @FoxBusiness @business ALL Traitors! Big Oil/OPEC/WAll Street Openly collude with Terrorist to raise oil prices then spread lies and propaganda about what is actually driving up price of Gasoline. your propaganda and illegal collusion is what driving up prices
1783 2018-07-05 20:58:35 This bio oil >>>>>>
1784 2018-07-05 20:58:32 Got you are dense. Go out and buy everything in your day to day life, without oil byproducts.

Let me know how that goes.
1785 2018-07-05 20:58:32 I think everyone understands and wishes you and your wife well. I'm not an MD, but has anyone suggested CBD oil for her? You might look into it.
1786 2018-07-05 20:58:20 Fail by the oil.   Now cue signing someone cause he is from Alberta for more money
1787 2018-07-05 20:58:13 unfortunately the palm oil industru may keep it deforestration project on tropical forest; the EU just postponed anti-deforestration policy on palm oil until 2030 and keep rising the import.
1788 2018-07-05 20:58:12 It is about the dunce left for a consulting job in oil & gas. Yea! #PruittFired
1789 2018-07-05 20:58:05 Henchman, most definitely. His future will be well compensated by Big Oil, Energy, and Pipeline. Not coal though, coal is broken like a buggy whip maker.
1790 2018-07-05 20:58:02 Make my own dressing, lemon, olive oil, mustard & honey - simples!
1791 2018-07-05 20:58:00 CO2 emission through the burning of fossil fuels...coal, oil, natural gas...media sometimes refers certain countries as "heavy polluters".... to be clear there are other products that are produced alongside CO2 (gas) that are indeed chemical pollutants....
1792 2018-07-05 20:57:59 Someone in San Fernando hangout with me while my car gets an oil change and detailed
1793 2018-07-05 20:57:57 Anybody buying CBD oil off of AMZN is getting swindled. NYERS save your money. Finally found someone. Man, my sleep is solo good these days.
1794 2018-07-05 20:57:54 Oil change, gas, and a hand wash. Say man.
1795 2018-07-05 20:57:42 You take the oil we take the wine
1796 2018-07-05 20:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1797 2018-07-05 20:57:32 I just go to Walmart and get a few of those packets of hair masks, anything with keratin and oils, you really wanna replace as much oil in your hair as possible and for the love of anything don’t wash it with shampoo (cleans oil) or use heat
1798 2018-07-05 20:57:32 But olive oil and vinaigrette were made for salads.....
1799 2018-07-05 20:57:17 I heard that Castor Oil helps with hair growth...should I only buy the original one or can I play around with the flavoured one? #GirlTalkZA
1800 2018-07-05 20:57:01 @ScarbsTech can you find out what a current F1 oil is like in terms of viscosity? Curious how light they run today.
1801 2018-07-05 20:56:47 Let's not celebrate too long: his deputy was an oil lobbyist. He may be even more damaging since he may not have scandals dogging his policy.
1802 2018-07-05 20:56:44 You think a tweet will magically reduce the price of oil? 
Geeeeeeez. Dummy!
1803 2018-07-05 20:56:41 If my girl not willing to pull out them Titties & rub some Lube / oil / Vaseline all over them for me to fuck em while she on her period we can’t be together ... period ..

Boob Sex is a deal breaker
1804 2018-07-05 20:56:33 Enough. I am done. I don’t keep my head in the sand. I care for humanity.  I work in soup kitchens. I attend events. I help my youth group. And I vote on an educated call. And I don’t fall for snake oil from a reality fraud.
1805 2018-07-05 20:56:30 @realDonaldTrump  Crude Oil earnings are Owed: private American NOT a Factious Enities. As Americans, Pay public servants:  You DO NOT PAY SELF THROUGH THEIFT.    All is owned by: We the Peoples. Send Dividend to People
1806 2018-07-05 20:56:29 And inviting big oil and Goldman Sachs into to the Whitehouse is draining the swamp? Funny, I would have thought it was filling it up! :) With regards to the economy, you're getting short term gain for long term pain! Numerous economists disagree with Trump's actions..
1807 2018-07-05 20:56:28 You lot shaku shaku so stiff. Oil your bloody joints you drill Sargent robot.
1808 2018-07-05 20:56:24 Forehead doesn’t know if it wants to be an oil slick or Sahara desert
1809 2018-07-05 20:56:19 I wonder what corrupt, scandal monkey, sycophantic, oil baron our Russian-rimming Reality TV goon-in-charge will choose to continue the crusade of personal profiteering at the expense of public interests? We live in the dumbest timeline.
1810 2018-07-05 20:56:11 I think he’s just stepping down to pursue his lifelong dream of beating a polar bear to death with an aerosol can from an exploding oil well..
1811 2018-07-05 20:56:11 Yankees eat their pizza with olive oil and vinaigrette
1812 2018-07-05 20:56:07 We will buy oil from Russia instead of Venezuela, further destabilizing South America, increasing refugees. Russia will stop propping Venezuela up, Iran will list anither supported and we will have another enemy to the South. Putin just chuckles at his game. Who's winning? Not US
1813 2018-07-05 20:56:01 #bagholding oil bulls. Are you ready for the next #tsla short squeeze when Soft bank or a Chinese auto bail them out, for now?
1814 2018-07-05 20:55:57 And Pruitt can go lobby for oil and gas industry where he belongs.
1815 2018-07-05 20:55:51 Sure, it's bright for the oil and gas industry which is salivating to drill on public lands and in all that wasted space in our national parks.
1816 2018-07-05 20:55:48 It is called being strong and fit - we used to have penty oil rig workers like that. You are ansolute B's to scan !
1817 2018-07-05 20:55:45 Love that Podcast! might have to get me some Rosehip oil as well.
1818 2018-07-05 20:55:44 i slipped on baby oil
1819 2018-07-05 20:55:42 I don't know what that Moscow meeting was about, but I do find those states relationship to oil and gas more than interesting in the current context :)
1820 2018-07-05 20:55:33 Also, when nuclear fusion (fission) becomes feasible a kilo (2.2lbs) of uranium will yield the equivalent of 100K barrels of oil.
1821 2018-07-05 20:55:32 He helped make America the number 1 Oil producer in the world. He cut 1,500 BS over reaching Regulations implemented by Obumer. Scott did a wonderful job and accomplished far more then expected. #OOTT
1822 2018-07-05 20:55:32 Bye Scott Pruitt I hope you get trapped in an oil spill
1823 2018-07-05 20:55:16 Need to get an oil as soon as I come back to MS next week 
1824 2018-07-05 20:55:12 Are you telling me the pilots have been in hiatus because they couldn't find an oil change at a good price or what
1825 2018-07-05 20:55:01 Suavacito isn't fancy at all. Does a job, not very smelly, VERY water soluble. So it'll come out with a bit of a rinse. Comes in 2 holds, regular and EXTRA FIRME. And it's on amazon prime. I'm still on the hunt for a good beard shampoo and oil :C
1826 2018-07-05 20:54:59 Hey Phony One! What constitutes BIG OIL?
1827 2018-07-05 20:54:54 InfoChip's tags are chemically etched & designed to withstand harsh conditions found in mines, on oil rigs, & other industrial areas.
1828 2018-07-05 20:54:30 "Scott is looking forward to continuing to destroying the environment  by dumping used motor oil into one storm drain at a time."
1829 2018-07-05 20:54:29 Pulease, Pruitt milked big oil, big pharma, big chemical companies for millions all the while letting them destroy the environment. He left because he’d tapped as many wells as possible and got out before he was put in prison. Which he SHOULD be sent to jail!
1830 2018-07-05 20:54:17 @JustinTrudeau choose clean water and not oil. Stop tar sands extractions
1831 2018-07-05 20:54:05 I smell oil I mean freedom
1832 2018-07-05 20:53:49 Screaming out the "economics don't work" doesn't help at all prove the case. Saying "It's more profitable for US business to buy cheap canadian oil and sell over priced gasoline" would be a better argument. But be at the mercy of US refiners.
1833 2018-07-05 20:53:48 LOL, the oil industry may hate EV's but the auto industry is racing to put out the best (and it may not be Tesla). Don't confuse the fate of one company with the technology. The lenders who own all of Tesla's material assets will work to ensure they survive (and prosper).
1834 2018-07-05 20:53:23 Ain't he the one who declared that spilt milk in Paul Ryan's home state must be treated in the same manner as an oil spill? And, farmers in the Midwest who kick up dust on their farm roads will be fined? Good riddance.
1835 2018-07-05 20:53:21 Pruitt must’ve thought he’d died and went to heaven when God blessed him with all those EPA staff to cater to his every desire & those taxpayer $ in the budget to pay for his 1st class travel & vacations. Plus he could spread blessing to friends in the coal & oil industries!
1836 2018-07-05 20:53:14 What Scott Pruitt accomplished is amazing and what you should acknowledge. The US is fast becoming one of the largest oil producers. The result of the regulations he cut is has resulted in US gaining $$$$$ and jobs. True conservatives wanted Pruitt to remain.
1837 2018-07-05 20:53:02 Unfortunately, I am afraid tRump will just appoint another SWAMP creature to take his place to fulfill the dreams of the LOBBYISTS of the OIL AND COAL Companies and others who don't want to be regulated!
1838 2018-07-05 20:52:52 From the silence of UN you will understand that Biafra oil is a world power national cake so they want Fulani replacement @EmmanuelMacron do you know that corruption was written all over him when he said that France will not solve Africa problem. Money can't buy them all @MBuhari
1839 2018-07-05 20:52:42 By “outstanding job” you mean dismantling the EPA, taking money from oil, coal and just ab anyone else that paid him and turning the clock back 50 years on the environment. What’s climate change again??
1840 2018-07-05 20:52:39 YIKES. Um, olive oil or vegetable oil would probably help, but you'll need to let it sit for a couple of minutes to make sure it's really gotten good and soaked.

The only other thing I know of is acetone and you do NOT want to get that near a dog. 
1841 2018-07-05 20:52:39 My God would never condone any of that, he'll condemn it..trust me.  Trump & Co will not pass go and collect $200, but doused in oil before being sent to hell.  I'm an agnostic...so it's just my version of nirvana
1842 2018-07-05 20:52:39 Early candidates for Scott Pruitt’s replacement include Roseanne, Kanye, and an actual oil spill
1843 2018-07-05 20:52:31 Oil company shill #Pruitt is out of the @GOP Trump administration. Will this be the name that breaks the @maddow screen again?
1844 2018-07-05 20:52:16 Free market jerk wade.   Why aren't these great american oil companies producing enough to keep prices down jerk wade.  You are the one messing with markets jerk wade.  Just more shit show from Drafting Dodging Donnie Trump the Chump.
1845 2018-07-05 20:52:14 I want to go and live in Spain. With olive oil, hams,rioja  and the ocean.......oh and satellite. (Or a close airport) I couldn't live without @ManCity
1846 2018-07-05 20:52:08 So many of us people around the globe who thought Iraq war was for liberating Iraqis and not for oil
1847 2018-07-05 20:51:50 Garrett’s work is changing the oil in my car in the morning and he is trying to pay for it. Bless his heart. He knows I’m a broke girl
1848 2018-07-05 20:51:49 #FoxNews Right On Point @Harlan !! Pruitt worked at the pleasure of @POTUS and implemented his agenda Now Our Country Is Doing Awesome with GDP and Oil Production
1849 2018-07-05 20:51:44 Scott Pruitt resigned from the EPA bc his aides laughed at his plan to shoot oil out of a huge hose into the ocean while screaming “fuck you ocean”
1850 2018-07-05 20:51:44 In fairness; ND & WV made the decision that oil & coal were worth turning natural beauty & personal health into an unending hellscape. & for the GOP Senators, the next best thing to the Exec Branch actively making government impotent is being totally inept at your job.
1851 2018-07-05 20:51:34 He'll just become a lobbyist for the Oil industry, which is what he already was.
1852 2018-07-05 20:51:31 Try putting it on her paw if she won't eat it (assuming it's oil) she'll clean it off.
1853 2018-07-05 20:51:29 Bernie Sanders just painted Pruitt perfectly. ...an agent of the oil industry.
1854 2018-07-05 20:51:16 I was the same, which is why I like the Breaze oil is drug free and non drowsy.  Which is the last thing I need 
1855 2018-07-05 20:51:05 Lol,  no one cares ABOUT it. 
Your pissed off the Arabs, they're going to jack up oil prices.
1856 2018-07-05 20:50:56 I once sat through a presentation about putting unique assets—e.g., oil wells—in IRAs. My training as a really sharp probate lawyer does me a lot of good in criminal court.
1857 2018-07-05 20:50:49 Nods, if it wasn't that I need both flower and oil/butter to satisfy my medical needs, I'd simply infuse it all, I already bought coconut oil so that I can make it
1858 2018-07-05 20:50:49 Just a friendly reminder the ranch will be closed tomorrow July 6th and Saturday, July 7th. Come to see us next week when we are open Thurs, Fri & Saturday.
1859 2018-07-05 20:50:39 stop bullshitting! the things CCP has robbed from Uyghurs are much much more than they have given! all oil, gas, natural resources!
1860 2018-07-05 20:50:37 I need to start learning how to take care of a car!! Like how to change the oil, change a tire, fix things if it breaks. Driving comes with a lot of responsibilities!
1861 2018-07-05 20:50:36 very strange situation ,,, ,, i still have all my hair,,.. natural,, i uze coconut oil every day
1862 2018-07-05 20:50:34 We are on the verge of becoming the World's Greatest Oil and Gas producer because of the rolling back of bad policy of Obama. Trump continues to Win and New EPA guy will continue Winning Ways.
1863 2018-07-05 20:50:27 More like carrot oil knowing liv...
1864 2018-07-05 20:50:27 my frying pan is so non stick I can fry bacon with no oil and the bacon will literally jump out of the frying pan on to the floor.
1865 2018-07-05 20:50:23 You have a deficit because you don't have a sales tax, refuse to charge fair royalties and have excessive subsidies to big oil.

This has occured because you are controlled by the oil industry. Since Lougheed left...

1875 2018-07-05 20:49:38 “Upon cleaning out Pruitt’s Office, aides found several oil field fires left still burning and unattended.”
1876 2018-07-05 20:49:37 Too Bad the Oil are strong on the wings. Otherwise Chiarelli might of taken a flyer on him.
1877 2018-07-05 20:49:33 Transformative work of wrecking the environment and turning the planet over to oil & mining companies, as the Good Lord intended.
1878 2018-07-05 20:49:09 Trump wants the price of oil to increase, bigger profits for Big Oil.
1879 2018-07-05 20:49:08 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
1880 2018-07-05 20:49:00 The palm oil comments people have left are disrespectful and not about truly promoting the issue, just one-upmanship. We all need to respect each others decisions on where to draw the line. Imo those people have joined a movement for the wrong reason - to feel superior to others
1881 2018-07-05 20:48:58 EPA minister resign it is the best news in the whole entire Republican on the Trump Administration begin this is very important next big oil EPA environmentalist is coming same hands different gloves 
1882 2018-07-05 20:48:44 I hear they have a nice oil well for sale
1883 2018-07-05 20:48:40 This entire administration is about following the oil!
1884 2018-07-05 20:48:39 I came here to get a fucking oil change. End up buying a whole air filter. #freemycar
1885 2018-07-05 20:48:35 Ive been told that not selectively timbering creates massive forest fire potential.  Maybe we could just make the state a national theme park and charge admission... We dont need coal, timber or oil.  Or this lamp or this ashtray...
1886 2018-07-05 20:48:29  sto ancora ridendo per la teoria dei terremoti. Cmq tranquillo, sono cose tecniche e io ho lavorato 30 anni nella ricerca e sviluppo oil & gas. Giocavo in casa...
1887 2018-07-05 20:48:29 If a bullet hits the Strait of Hormuz, the price of oil will rise to more than a hundred dollars, which will cause trouble for the whole world. More than that, Trump will not interfere with OPEC issues. This is not the way to destroy or ruin the Iranian government.
1888 2018-07-05 20:48:12 Hide it well!! The CBD oil tastes like shite but worked
1889 2018-07-05 20:48:05 You working the thong with the baby oil , Bird Boy ?
1890 2018-07-05 20:48:00 Shedloads of oil income may have somewhat lessened the blow...
1891 2018-07-05 20:47:58 The search is on for a new #EPA secretary in #Trump's administration.

Criteria:

1. Must be rich, mega rich.
2. Ideally has links to the oil lobby
3. Must hate the environment
4. Ideally clueless
1892 2018-07-05 20:47:58 Drop hot oil on my instep now that shit blistered off . No gym for the rest of the week 
1893 2018-07-05 20:47:56 Crude prices make up 65% of gas prices, OPEC sets crude oil prices. Has nothing to do with who the POTUS is
1894 2018-07-05 20:47:56 It just took two hours to get my oil changed. No wonder I drove around with the light on for two weeks.
1895 2018-07-05 20:47:44 The more Trump drives oil prices up, the richer Putin gets.
1896 2018-07-05 20:47:30 No probably next week. Still gotta run my oil lines and water for the turbo and tap my oil pan lol
1897 2018-07-05 20:47:24 I thought we had plenty of oil here in the US can't we tell them to take a hike?
1898 2018-07-05 20:47:22 more entitlement than need, his time in Oklahoma shows similar behavior on a lesser scale, he was beyond friendly with the oil/gas/coal industries, he saw a federal job as a gravy train, he wanted rewarded for destroying the environment and pleasing evangelicals
1899 2018-07-05 20:47:20 Quick blame it on the NDP like everything else you do. 
Hey how about you work on the homeless situation in Edmonton and what your party is going to do. OR talk about how your party is planning on battling the opioid crisis across the province. 
But ya keep talking about OIL.
1900 2018-07-05 20:47:18 Scott Pruitt needed to resign because he was wasting money.

Not because he was making oil cheaper by rolling back needless regulation
1901 2018-07-05 20:47:17 Haha. I met my (now x) 17-year sig other while under a car changing the oil. I was cussing up a storm (teehee) an he asked me if I needed help. I told him no, that I needed to learn to do this job. Then his dog came to visit. And before I knew it, we were living together. Haha.
1902 2018-07-05 20:47:17 Scott Pruitt is an oil spill wearing a suit jacket to try and disguise himself as a human being so good riddance.
1903 2018-07-05 20:47:15 Total farce ... sham. Snake oil show.
1904 2018-07-05 20:47:13 All Oil Companies should start drilling just offshore from Mar-a-Lago. @POTUS deserves to be the recipient of his EPA policies.
1905 2018-07-05 20:47:06 Lol, ok. Whatever. What size would that be? Then does it leak oil? HD has more problems than they actually deal with.
1906 2018-07-05 20:47:04 100% true. I’ve been in the oilfield for 15 years. Oil prices tanked in 2015 (like it had many times in the past) and finally started coming back up just like it does every time.
1907 2018-07-05 20:47:03 Rub my belly with lavender oil while I’m on my period so I know it’s real
1908 2018-07-05 20:47:01 Chef McElroy cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with toothpaste.
1909 2018-07-05 20:46:56 Human oil can opener......
1910 2018-07-05 20:46:41 Increase solar energy generation and a lot of those rises in oil prices would go away. Get somebody to explain the math to you.
1911 2018-07-05 20:46:33 Well you are not going to like Andrew Wheeler either. They EPA will continue to be eradicated under Wheeler another Coal and oil guy.
1912 2018-07-05 20:46:32 He'll probably just nominate a leaky barrel of oil instead.
1913 2018-07-05 20:46:30 Go to the oil depot, jiffy lube over charges
1914 2018-07-05 20:46:23 Trump is a CHOKER, so he choked on Pruitt, as he did on Tom Price, both natural Trump supporters. He listens to Hannity and Ingraham who were BOTH #NeverTrump or close. And the Kushners, who are Israel First, and who would drive up oil prices to get at Iran, a democracy.
1915 2018-07-05 20:46:09 Not for long! Since being in the Trump mob, he’s rubbed shoulders with many other corrupt scum. He’ll end up working @ Koch Oil!
1916 2018-07-05 20:45:56 lying in the back yard w my tits out, suntan oil on, iced coffee in hand, boyfriend next to me and listening to destiny’s child is today’s mood :)
1917 2018-07-05 20:45:47 I had oil on my hands and broke a nail, lets just say team effort shall we
1918 2018-07-05 20:45:31 Alright Swunt. Let's get this thru that thick skull. The crude oil you guys are so concerned about?
1919 2018-07-05 20:45:26 EPA's Scott Pruitt resigned today. If he had been on The Apprentice, Trump would've told him: you're fired! Which is what really happened behind the scenes I'm sure. Now Pruitt can get back to Big Oil and Coal, which he never left anyway. #TheResistance #fucktrump #EPA
1920 2018-07-05 20:45:24 I can’t wait to see which oil or coal company hires him. The one that benefits the most from his reversal of regulations? I’m not a betting man but would lay down big bucks on that one.
1921 2018-07-05 20:45:23 "Shame to lose all that good oil in the stupid ocean."
1922 2018-07-05 20:45:18 it really was nothing ksfkdjshfds i put like a bit too much oil in the pan and it made a teeny tiny bit smoke 
1923 2018-07-05 20:45:16 This is a big win for trump. 

It will happen, but i think Iran will be the bargin not Syria. 

I believe that America wants to take off pressure on other fronts to put pressure on Iran and use all it's might for this one. 

Oil embargo, Iran will block Strait, Navy will come in.
1924 2018-07-05 20:45:11 What's cooking oil Kwa Mashu? Is it Amos???
1925 2018-07-05 20:45:04 Jeez, Shawn. Calm down. In America people are allowed to disagree with you.  It just so happens a majority of Americans are looking forward to restoring everything that is helping America fight climate change and free us from dependence on oil from the Middle East. USA!!!
1926 2018-07-05 20:45:04 Seriously, 39% of you don't believe that oil companies are gouging us in BC. Naive!
1927 2018-07-05 20:45:01 So you sell protection for oil..... man that’s mob tactics. Trump crime family.
1928 2018-07-05 20:45:01 I've never bought Walkers prefer golden wonder as they only use potatoes n sunflower oil whereas Walkers use wheat flour the air adds weight to it 
1929 2018-07-05 20:44:58 Scott Pruitt’s replacement is definitely a guy whose first reaction to the BP oil spill was, "This is going to really hurt their stock prices."

1931 2018-07-05 20:44:52 So we got rid of Big Oil and in walks Big Coal.
Annddd...... where are his emails?????
1932 2018-07-05 20:44:51 Would have been nice if you would nominate a scientist instead of a lawyer that worked with big oil.  LYMES.  You know what that is, but since not having winters we used to have, the ticks do not die off.  Not an easy illness to deal with. but you get free healthcare on taxpayers
1933 2018-07-05 20:44:48 Scott Pruitt’s title is going to change, but he will continue the same hard work he was doing at EPA: making oil, gas, and coal companies significantly wealthier and less accountable.
1934 2018-07-05 20:44:36 I know wth? He’s still a oil talking head though
1935 2018-07-05 20:44:20 @elonmusk That drop in tsla was 90% Gordan Johnson's fault.  10% trump/market tariff.  Gordan is a 100% oil pumper.  He's one who will (even if you make a profit) tell you the company will be bankrupt.  He's just an a$$hole who's short and uses his media influence to take it down
1936 2018-07-05 20:44:10 i mean you can still dip your schmeat in cheesy oil, as long as you keep your macros in check. i eat a shit ton of meat, esp pepperoni and salami, but the amount of fat in them and in the other stuff i eat balances it out

1941 2018-07-05 20:43:59 Absolutely marvelous. Scott Pruitt has bit the Dust. Now hopefully he'll be indicted for his thievery. & I hope that Trump doesn't appoint another oil lobbyist in his place. & I hope it's not a step for Trump to appoint Pruitt as the Attorney General. Impeach Trump. Vote Democrat
1942 2018-07-05 20:43:58 Uh keep yer tax dollars... Alberta just ran an $8B deficit on high oil prices... 

How? Cuz they give it all away to big oil. And don't tax anyone, including you, enough.
1943 2018-07-05 20:43:53 Lol considering the oil patch has some of the highest paying jobs for unskilled workers in the world and that @jkenney is fighting to keep those jobs shows the opposite of what you’re saying.

#ScottPruittsNewCareer
1964 2018-07-05 20:41:29 lmao scott pruitt is retiring i'm just sad i never got the opportunity to throw a shoe or some crude oil or something at him.
1965 2018-07-05 20:41:22 I think their main beef is that once the oil/tar sands started booming there has been no investment of any significance in renewables. The small university research projects don’t count. It has been more $$ now to supposedly pay for renewables for decades!
1966 2018-07-05 20:41:19 Let's see what round two looks like.
Maybe one of the duck dynasty guys, or a Skeletor action figure made of crude oil.
1967 2018-07-05 20:41:01 There's a reason he HAD to win the elections at all costs. Because he would have likely faced corruption charges along with his son-in-law. Who was allegedly in charge of the illegal oil trade from Syria and ISIS & AQ. If true then that money did not end up in official accounts.
1968 2018-07-05 20:40:58 Whoop! Wine & @LoveIsland, such a novelty after 2 weeks burning the midnight oil in the edit!
1969 2018-07-05 20:40:57 Let’s wait to find out what earth-hating, big oil monger he picks next.
1970 2018-07-05 20:40:51 End the dependence on foreign oil with new energy concepts. Necessity is the mother of invention.
1971 2018-07-05 20:40:48 I just splurged and bought some lavender body oil, lavender Epson salt, tea tree oil, coconut oil, and dry roses
1972 2018-07-05 20:40:47 I need breaks and a oil change bur my pockets not feeling it
1973 2018-07-05 20:40:47 What I'm afraid of is who is Trump going to replace him with? A Big Oil exec?
1974 2018-07-05 20:40:42 Paris accord will do more destruction than we could possibly do. 
Check your facts, Pakistan and China,  biggest harm to world environment.
Drill for oil and building pipelines and stopping logging because of fake bird stories, does not destroy.
Liberal environmentalists=idiots
1975 2018-07-05 20:40:41 I prefer butter, tallow, ghee or bacon grease. If you don't want to use those, olive oil and coconut oil are better choices than the seed oils.
1976 2018-07-05 20:40:37 I think what the Turkana public require your Excellency with regard to their oil is cash in their phones. The rest of the complaints will be sorted out instantly.

Pruitt said it was an honor protecting the environment, then he got in his private jet fueled by fossilized snow-leopard bones and flew to his oil wells in Oklahoma.

1986 2018-07-05 20:39:44 That money is just pocket change for the USA Big Oil that is paying for the Anti-Pipeline and Anti-Oilsands campaigns.

1988 2018-07-05 20:39:38 OIL FAN FOILED, CANNED
1989 2018-07-05 20:39:38 Right, that is literally what they exist to do, and the payback can be very fast for short pipelines feeding a rich oilfields to constrained markets. That aside, overall investment in oil is down. Sure, some projects will be built, but the again the trend is to shift away
1990 2018-07-05 20:39:35 Scott Pruitt is a piece of shit who sold out his county men and women to big business oil and gas. Fuck him and may his children and grand children be reminded of his legacy for the next 100 years. Fuck you Scott.

2031 2018-07-05 20:35:56 We may also find ourselves in a situation where Dollar will continue to rise exponentially (due to 10-year QE unwinding effect) and RBI continues to raise the rates to tame inflation.

2042 2018-07-05 20:35:02 You know the carbon tax is something that could use reworking. Maybe instead of the revenue going into general funds it could go to something specific, like the heritage fund. Would that be better in your opinion? Maybe help us rely less on oil royalties
2043 2018-07-05 20:35:02 Which would you prefer Enzo, gas or oil?
2044 2018-07-05 20:35:02 Scott Pruit stepping down is very good news. Oil and Gas are quintessential parts of the American well being, from medical equipment to life comforts. But pollution restrictions are in place because of an already proven detriment to Americans. How did he ignore that? #EPA
2045 2018-07-05 20:35:01 Question have you forgotten that the US is also now a major exporter of oil since fragging operation have now become part of the oil business in the US so how you explain that effect on US oil prices in our country
2046 2018-07-05 20:34:59 That I understand I just prefer not to use shit like that on my body. Shea butter or coconut oil. That’s it
2047 2018-07-05 20:34:58 Variations on a Mediterranean salad, cukes, black olives (not brined), tomatoes, red onion, peppers, artichokes, oil, vinegar, fresh herbs.
2048 2018-07-05 20:34:57 Lol you gotta experience this for yourself to understand
2049 2018-07-05 20:34:46 No, I think you’d be ok with the oil. Massage it into the dry patches. X
2050 2018-07-05 20:34:45 Black soap is good for your face my mom uses it and coconut oil

2056 2018-07-05 20:34:26 As in blair and bush were intent on boosting popularity by starting a war.  I think Libya maybe oil and leverage.  Very different (apparent) foreign policy agendas at present. Staying alive with the Orange Shitgibbon and Putin running the show is going to be a challenge
2057 2018-07-05 20:34:24 no, i would but i'm too poor to afford weed to smoke plus weed for oil/butter.. once i can grow my medical weed, i'll be able to do that
2058 2018-07-05 20:34:21 Not for long.  bet he is back real soon as a LOBBYIST for the Coal Industry, or Pesticide Industry or Oil industry
2059 2018-07-05 20:34:21 Pruit and Big Oil are out.  Wheeler and King Coal are in.  Small victory.
2060 2018-07-05 20:34:14 Nothin takes the pep outta my step like “fresh oil and chips” 
2061 2018-07-05 20:33:59 It's all good, Scott Pruitt is going to drown his sorrows by bathing in a stream of oil/waste contaminated water and resting on a giant pile of Trump Hotel mattresses after
2062 2018-07-05 20:33:54 Let’s start laying bets on which lobbying firm - oil, coal gas - will snap up Pruitt (who is still close to Donald John) as a multi million dollar consultant before the mid terms
2063 2018-07-05 20:33:44 Free (unsolicited) ideas for c-stores : 1. Bring back FULL service lane- put my gas in, check my oil, and wash my windshield...I would pay more  2. Recycling bin beside trash cans for plastic/glass. #free #ideas #sharingiscaring @oncueexpress
2064 2018-07-05 20:33:37 Does anyone think that maybe Trump and Putin are colluding on Power and Oil Dominance. Trump has and is talking with Saudi Arabia. Talked about invading Venezuela in 2017, an oil country. And the list goes on. I don't know maybe I'm just paranoid.
2065 2018-07-05 20:33:34 Trump will find another Oil executive to take his place - no sense trying to hide the agenda because his base do not have the intelligence to know that Climate Change is real - funny how gas prices have risen a dollar since Trumps very small crowd inauguration
2066 2018-07-05 20:33:25 Scott Pruitt will go down as the first director of the EPA who was an Oil Tycoon. He will be remembered for removing scientists from the Scientific Review Board, and most importantly his rollback of automobile CO2 emission standards. Truly the worst.
2067 2018-07-05 20:33:23 Natural hair so thick. Cant wait to out this hot oil treatment on it
2068 2018-07-05 20:33:23 The next one will be a coal and oil person and #GOP will embrace it.
2069 2018-07-05 20:33:23 Let's divvy the oil
2070 2018-07-05 20:33:15 That is horseshit. It's like saying killing animals for food is all the same. Until society can divest from oil & it's byproducts, it is everyone's responsibility (even you) to ensure your products come from a nation that supports LGBTQ+, equality, social & environment programs.
2071 2018-07-05 20:33:11 .@nncattan spoke today with Alfonso Romo, head of @lopezobrador_  's transition team, about the future of Mexico's oil reform. Check what he told her on @TheTerminal
2072 2018-07-05 20:33:08 Having a beard is NOT a personality trait...stop letting these dudes get you hot and bothered because they smell like coconut beard oil..he still trash sis

I think you'd save some money if you have the time. 
Any thoughts Dianna @FinallyInspired?
2074 2018-07-05 20:32:57 Bankruptcy or not, if he disrupts the car industry to make the change away from oil- it'll still be a success. 
So I'm going to go with taking responsibility on that one.

I’m an honest scientist who also worked on oil rigs in Abu Dhabi.

Climate change is real and man made.
2078 2018-07-05 20:32:49 Where is that witch who sold our reserves of oil
2079 2018-07-05 20:32:46 An alternative to oil needs to be found other than electric as so they don’t have us over a barrel, an alternative to oil must be found ASAP.
2080 2018-07-05 20:32:37 Sounds like you should be protesting ALL the cargo ships then. Shut di b the port . But we know that stopping Alberta oil is the real objective

2084 2018-07-05 20:32:16 Hi Ab I use the oil mainly on my shoulder blade due to #costochondritis pain & yes it helps but I also take a magnesium supplement everyday too to keep topped up. I think anything that stops the pain is going to help you sleep better x

2086 2018-07-05 20:32:08 "Scott Pruitt" has resigned and will be replaced by a radioactive oil drum made of lead...
2087 2018-07-05 20:32:07 ok at first i didn’t believe in all the essential oil hype but, it’s like legit. it works. there’s something for everything. it’s great.

2090 2018-07-05 20:31:52 I wonder who the next EPA administrator will be. An oil magnate perhaps? Or the lava monster from Moana?

#ByeScottPruitt #GoFossilizeYourself
2091 2018-07-05 20:31:48 You keep trying to make this about your unethical oil vs other countries unethical oil.  It doesn't matter whose unethical oil it is, it matters that burning fossil fuel needs to stop.  Now get out of our way so we can focus on the transition

2095 2018-07-05 20:31:33 I think you are missing the point here. I believe this is part of a clever diplomatic game plan by Iran to trash Trump's attempt at keeping the Oil prices down for sanctions to succeed. Mere mention of possible disruptions of Oil supplies is enough to send the prices north!

2098 2018-07-05 20:31:27 Oh yeah...the EPA is buying scientists but Big Oil isn’t.
2099 2018-07-05 20:31:24 DAPL pipeline in South Dakota was Canadian Tar sand oil being refined in Illinois and sold to China by....RUSSIA. Part of the Keyston XL also carries Russian bought oil. Those pipelines are NOT carrying US crude.

2102 2018-07-05 20:31:20 Luca and Leo have decided to cook steak in MILK cos there no oil  WTF MAN I don’t know them
2103 2018-07-05 20:31:19 The entire #gopCrimeSyndicate are big oil and fossil fuel toadies.
2104 2018-07-05 20:31:14 He will land as a lobbyist for big coal or big oil.  He is in the good ole boy posse.
2105 2018-07-05 20:31:12 Oh cool we are going from an oil guy to a coal guy.
2106 2018-07-05 20:31:10 So why embargo oil from Iran you dummy? Saudis control OPEC and they are dragging USA into their war against Iran, as is Israel. Be a mensch, tell them all to fuck off. There is so much oil and so little demand, but yet they play you.
2107 2018-07-05 20:31:01 I cant see how having another refinery is going to keep the petrol price down. Isn't the new refinery going to want to make a profit? We will still have to import oil at international price, just more capacity to refine it here.
2108 2018-07-05 20:30:57 If he's unable to get a job with the oil and gas industry, maybe he'll write devotional literature for church use =)
2109 2018-07-05 20:30:54 Warfare not included? Well then, how about the civilian lives thrown at an expense for monetary gain, and not all businesses start small, some did like mcdonalds but thenthere are businisses like oil companies or the steel manufacturers, they didn’t start small.

2112 2018-07-05 20:30:33 I was there and bloody Grouillard oiled the track from the beginning of 2nd sector onwards. It wasn’t ”some oil”. It was all the oil there was in that Fondmetall.

2116 2018-07-05 20:30:23 Super excited to see how a coal lobbyist will run the environmental protection agency as compared to the previous oil lobbyist who ran the environmental protection agency
2117 2018-07-05 20:30:16 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
2118 2018-07-05 20:30:11 Hopefully the transition can clean up the giant oil spill left behind and we can restore our environment!
2119 2018-07-05 20:30:08 Don’t worry it gets me all the time. Even worse at the minute than ever, every word it ‘corrects’ is utter crap. Bit like the Satnav in the Disco taking me the ‘scenic’ route Weds. Oh the new diff I had put on is leaking oil now. Back Monday to make them sort that ffs
2120 2018-07-05 20:30:04 Lets just buy oil from other countries!!! They are more likely to hold up the environmental standards that a companies in the US would right?
2121 2018-07-05 20:30:04 If you can find a fragrance oil that is body safe I can make soap with it. I had one that smelled like fresh mowed grass, it smelled more like cucumber to me but I live in the desert and haven't had a grass lawn in 25 years
2122 2018-07-05 20:30:02 A smarmy snake oil lying thief will always put the blame on others.
2123 2018-07-05 20:30:01 Trump holds onto his cabinet members as distractions to his own bad behavior until he can be convinced that they have reached the Tipping Point and finally embarrass him.  Next up will be Betsy Voss.  Tillerson was fortunate to get out when he did; Trump wasn't going to get oil.
2124 2018-07-05 20:29:58 Well I googled Mr. Wheeler, coal lobbyist, law for energy Division of his firm, oil, gas, coal... so there will be no more protection and our environmental protection agency, once again. But I guess I wasn’t expecting much and I wasn’t disappointed.
2125 2018-07-05 20:29:51 What southern oil exec with a ridiculous mustache is about to become the new head of the EPA?
2126 2018-07-05 20:29:49 Of course, he'll probably get a job with an oil company
IN OKLAHOMA...
2127 2018-07-05 20:29:48 Now I feel guilty which is giving me more anxiety! I need cbd oil pills, stat! 
2128 2018-07-05 20:29:40 And US, Russian, and Saudi oil companies will get rich, while Iranian oil interests go down the tubes

2132 2018-07-05 20:29:17 Pruitt has set back the EPA fifty years. Pruitt and big oil have ruined the state of Oklahoma which now experiences more than 600 earthquakes a year.
2133 2018-07-05 20:29:06 Looks like a god damn Oil Painting 
2134 2018-07-05 20:29:05 Not if you use an oil based product to remove it.
2135 2018-07-05 20:29:04 You think OPEC and our oil corporations don't have this worked out? You think Fake-45 isn't invested in oil? You think OPEC doesn't know Fake-45 is posturing? Or poor innocent.
2136 2018-07-05 20:29:03 Who thinks Scott Pruitt will be replaced by a sentient oil rig to run the EPA? 
2137 2018-07-05 20:29:03 "Opec says they shall get the price down, but it does´nt. It´´s so unfair. I will force them to do so. By forcing and threat´s the oil price will go to the bottom. America first, yes I´m a genius, I know that"

2139 2018-07-05 20:28:56 Yep, we once had massive reserves of oil which the cadres sold for $20 a barrel when the price on world markets then was just under $100. They never miss an opportunity to loot.
2140 2018-07-05 20:28:55 Cool, so you were OK with Pruitt farming out EPA policy to Big Oil, overturning numerous invaluable environmental protection programs, gutting the agency and dramatically curtailing regional enforcement of EPA violations on violating entities?
2141 2018-07-05 20:28:51 I'm not sure what you consider record high but where I live it's far from the $4.75 back when Bush was in office and there is no reason gas should be at $2 a gallon we have millions of oil barrels buried in the ground but we rely on foreign oil way too much
2142 2018-07-05 20:28:48 HAHA this was before the coconut oil actually you freak
2143 2018-07-05 20:28:44 I usually get the brine packed olives, but I’ll have to see if I can find some nice, big olive oil packed ones for pasta because that sounds even more delicious!

2146 2018-07-05 20:28:24 His potential successor doesn't seem to be environmental friendly either....too many conflicts of interest with close connections to oil industry.
2147 2018-07-05 20:28:22 Quite apart from his hand lotion and tactical pants, Pruitt has done immeasurable damage to the planet, endangering our children and grandchildren. History will remember him as a Big Oil toady.
2148 2018-07-05 20:28:05 You sure he's not just setting up sales of Missouri to Big Oil, Mining Interests or Timber Companies?!?
Since Pruitt resigned, Zinke now tops the list for the title of Most Swampy in the Trump Swamp Olympics.
2149 2018-07-05 20:27:55 So our new #EPA chief is totally going to be an oil derrick, right? #ScottPruitt

2151 2018-07-05 20:27:47 I’ve been told not to by my doctor, also online it says not to drink straight castor oil for health reasons. My doc recommended a few other things I’ve been trying but my baby hasn’t dropped, sex isn’t working, I’m not dilating, my boy just doesn’t wanna come out.

2153 2018-07-05 20:27:31 It'll be too late when Americans, or better his voters, realize that they made a wrong choice. The guy's perpetrating a silent suicide of America's hegemony and arrogance. Just look at his tweet on oil price increase!
2154 2018-07-05 20:27:15 Mmmmm. I love the smell of refrigerant oil.

2156 2018-07-05 20:27:12 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
2157 2018-07-05 20:27:12 You realize it's way more than a couple of hundred right?  The water defenders have lots of local support. 

There is no "belief" here, it's climate science.  You can bleat about "ethical" oil all you want but NO OILIS ETHICAL

HTH.
2158 2018-07-05 20:27:06 Your supporters voted for you even though it was obvious you were a snake. So I guess they cannot allow themselves to admit that your snaky ways are eroding America. You're a huckster, and they bought your snake oil. You chuckle behind their backs.
2159 2018-07-05 20:27:03 And it speaks volumes this Jason bot , fed apologist drops total trash upon fin twitter, then blocks me....

He can debate the truth. Indeed his abode void of mirrors, sells snake oil like huckster in Harlem

2165 2018-07-05 20:26:27 As a native Oklahoman I can vouch that Pruitt is extremely corrupt and basically paid by the oil companies to do their bidding. Heinous fool, please move to another state!
2166 2018-07-05 20:26:23 "Well, Mr. President. Here is my letter. It has been an honor to serve you and this White House."

*Scott Pruitt dunks the head of a toucan into a bucket of crude oil and then uses the beak as a fountain pen to sign the tiger he tattooed his resignation letter onto*

2168 2018-07-05 20:26:17 Head of EPA Scott Pruitt has officially resigned due to various ethics scandals. Good riddance. How in the world someone with close ties to big oil was considered qualified to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, I’ll never understand.
2169 2018-07-05 20:26:17 SHAME ON NIGERIAN OIL MINISTRY FOR ALLOWING THIS AND FOR LINING THEIR OWN POCKETS WITH KICKBACKS FROM SHELL. SHAME ON EVERY PRESIDENT AND SENATE MEMBER FOR ALLOWING THE PEOPLE OF THE NIGER DELTA TO BE BLATANTLY DISRESPECTED.  SHAME ON YOU NIGERIA FOR TREATING YOUR PEOPLE SO RUDE
2170 2018-07-05 20:26:16 Dollars to donuts #ScottPruitt will be at a big oil company or lobbying firm by Monday.
2171 2018-07-05 20:26:12 I've had the same solar hot water panel on my roof quietly, odorously and carbon freely giving me hot water for 20 years plus.
I think you will find that data on bird kill from oil spillage and pollution far exceeds anything a wind turbine can achieve.

2176 2018-07-05 20:25:53 Can Putin denied he is not wealthy as to afford? He has built Russia into holding of World Cup. And have an empire of wealth too from oil.
2177 2018-07-05 20:25:41 You are destroying our National parks in favor of big oil.  Shame on you.
2178 2018-07-05 20:25:29 if you ever get back with your ex and one of the first things they tell you is block, unfollow, or delete somebody’s number, leave again cuz your relationship about to be more toxic than an oil spill in the atlantic ocean.
2179 2018-07-05 20:25:23 No. Seriously. Do you even know the engineering, regulations and standards required to do any oil project in Canada?
We have the most stringent environmental, health and safety standards, in the world.
Supporting Oil from Canada allows the world to divest from OPEC nations.
2180 2018-07-05 20:25:19 World Class should be sponsored by one of these big Texas oil companies, because all of our value is in the ground too.

2182 2018-07-05 20:25:17 Very relieved to find I have sesame oil.
2183 2018-07-05 20:25:10 I had no idea that there were trains that carried coal and oil right next to the ocean shore! That's insane! Where is the common sense here? #bcpoli

2185 2018-07-05 20:25:06 As a native Oklahoman I can vouch that Pruitt is extremely corrupt and basically paid by the oil companies to do their bidding. Heinous fool, please move to another state!
2186 2018-07-05 20:25:01 Bhakths are happy, when Modi keeps increasing fuel price for development though crude oil barrel price has hit the lowest!
Same Bhakths in #Karnataka are angry on @CMofKarnataka for putting cess on fuel by 1 Rupiah, So that he can waive off farmer’s loan.
2187 2018-07-05 20:24:56 @HardballChris  maybe if Pruitts wife gets her Chc-fel-e franchise, he can make the waffle fries with his oil background.
2188 2018-07-05 20:24:53 Trump is going to name an offshore oil rig as the next EPA head
2189 2018-07-05 20:24:53 Not just oil lol you only save like 5-10 bucks, but then you're fucking filthy, ain't worth it
2190 2018-07-05 20:24:53 Trump kicks over an oil barrel in the west wing, “That puddle of oil is now your new EPA chief”
2191 2018-07-05 20:24:52 Trump's corrupt, climate change denying, scandal ridden, coal loving, oil and gas lobby owned, first class traveling, $50/night room renting, environment hating, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt with a secret calendar, $3 million security detail and sound proof office has resigned.
2192 2018-07-05 20:24:51 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
2193 2018-07-05 20:24:44 おやすみなさいですっ！
2194 2018-07-05 20:24:42 As a native Oklahoman I can vouch that Pruitt is extremely corrupt and basically paid by the oil companies to do their bidding. Heinous fool, please move to another state!
2195 2018-07-05 20:24:33 When Obama ran my donations to his campaign would be from employee at Halliburton as I'd have to list my employer and now it's a corrupt donation cuz Big oil and gas. My co-workers' donations also.
2196 2018-07-05 20:24:32 i am sorry but you do know nuclear material is like oil in that yeah we have it but it something that will run out and yeah i know the reactors now are more safe then gen 1/2 ones but they still can fail and we’re are the waste going to go any were it goes no one can live near
2197 2018-07-05 20:24:31 What’s the Vegas over/under on Pruitt joining Koch Industries or a fracking oil producer by tomorrow?
2198 2018-07-05 20:24:31 "Scotland discovers oil" 
2199 2018-07-05 20:24:28 Trump’s list to replace Scott Pruitt at the EPA:

1. Oil slick from BP oil spill.
2. Burning garbage dumpster
3. 4 barrels of nuclear waste
4. A gallon of Flint, Michigan water
5. Exxon
2200 2018-07-05 20:24:27 Whhaaatttt????? Fortune rice bran oil is palm oil???  
2201 2018-07-05 20:24:24 おやすみなさい～！
2202 2018-07-05 20:24:24 Don't be sad. Wheeler can continue to destroy the environment and support coal and oil at the expense of public health. Look at some old photos of burning rivers to cheer yourself up.
2203 2018-07-05 20:24:22 The chart is no oil painting - at this time the stock is just holding support at $13.00 Its not a buy and hold stock - if you get in be prepared to trade for profits -
2204 2018-07-05 20:24:13 あ～～～～！！よき！！すてき！！！
2205 2018-07-05 20:24:10 "r/worldnews - Donald Trump, who recently called on OPEC producers to help reduce oil prices, has raised prices through his tweets, Iranian OPEC Governor Kazempour Ardebili has been quoted as saying | "Your tweets have increased the prices by at least $10.

2208 2018-07-05 20:24:07 Indeed! Data is perceived the new oil and like oil it needs proper handling and treatment to be useful to anyone.
It’s not a function of data size but about insights / information derived - whether data becomes an assets or liability depends on handling...
2209 2018-07-05 20:24:06 And you want more oil for your pipeline!!! Shame shame on you!
2210 2018-07-05 20:24:04 I used THC cooking oil in all of @stonerdottie food for her birthday without her knowing .... then I fucked up and switched the plates .... 
I woke up fuuuuuckes up today and she’s fine 
2211 2018-07-05 20:24:03 It’s just oil barons and sycophants all the way down.
2212 2018-07-05 20:23:51 Gotta oil up. Beautiful skin complexion. Cj
2213 2018-07-05 20:23:48 Then there'd be Castor oil somewhere down the road 
2214 2018-07-05 20:23:25 where do i go get an oil changeeeee i’m by myself sum1 help
2215 2018-07-05 20:23:23 Correction “oil lobby fearing man”
2216 2018-07-05 20:23:22 Try mixing spirits and tissue oil into plain aquas cream.... It lightens the stretchmarks
2217 2018-07-05 20:23:11 Scott Pruitt resigned to spend more time on his passion: lathering birds and ocean animals in crude oil.
2218 2018-07-05 20:23:10 Pruitt should be anathema to any employer, but, the sad news is that he will quickly get a position with Big Oil or a gig at Fox News.
2219 2018-07-05 20:23:01 What are you talking about? He has had a cushy lobbying gig for big oil and big coal since he was sworn in. That’s all he’s done. The only people he has met with.
2220 2018-07-05 20:22:50 is the Frack, in the Oil and Gas Industry sense, or in the Battlestar Gallactica meaning
2221 2018-07-05 20:22:49 You think a couple hundred of you know enough to sue a couple hundred thousand of us?

Your myopic beliefs are stemmed from emotion. Meanwhile, the "defenders" stop an ethical, & responsible from a global market, allowing the unethical oil to flood the market.
2222 2018-07-05 20:22:45 ههههههههههههههههههه  استنى
2223 2018-07-05 20:22:41 Nigeria, prepare for crude oil price crash
2224 2018-07-05 20:22:40 Conventional wisdom in Washington is that Scott Pruitt remained in the good graces of President Trump because he was so effective at rolling back Obama-era clean air regulations in favor of fossil fuels--coal and oil.
2225 2018-07-05 20:22:38 I’m interested to hear of the developers of these gas and oil fields and how all the wealth they generate is improving life in Gaza. Do you know if an article or book about this?
2226 2018-07-05 20:22:30 What non-scientist, oil/coal aficionado, millionaire (will he wear special pants, special lotion, too) will take his place?
2227 2018-07-05 20:22:25 always a “scare” if wages go up or price of oil drops
2228 2018-07-05 20:22:23 @TonyD1070 @JMV1070 needs full syringe shots of the CBD oil lol 
2229 2018-07-05 20:22:21 Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series Update: 

Unfortunately, Mother Nature isn't cooperating! The test-n-tune has been cancelled. 

We will be issuing Test-n-Tune refunds for those who purchased. 

Please head to the payout room located on the 2nd floor of the Parks Tower.
2230 2018-07-05 20:22:16 Tights, a thick black belt made from petroleum products. A cape, of course (see The Incredibles). Crude oil  shooting out of his wrist cuffs
2231 2018-07-05 20:22:07 Really? Name one thing the EPA has done under your regime that benefited the average citizen. One  who doesn't own oil wells or coal mines?
2232 2018-07-05 20:22:05 Scott Pruitt blew millions of taxpayer dollars on comically corrupt and pathetic personal expenses, and kept Trump’s and Republicans’ support because he was doing a good job ignoring climate change, giving handouts to oil companies, and expediting the destruction of our planet.
2233 2018-07-05 20:22:03 自分の首を持った推しの絵 すきです
2234 2018-07-05 20:21:59 For sure. From the “God’s providence” stuff to the blame shifting. 

“Unprecedented and unrelenting attacks on me personally.”

Lol maybe you shouldn’t be such a corrupt douchebag who wants to destroy the earth in the name of oil, bro.
2235 2018-07-05 20:21:55 You also want to find out who funded the research. This *can* add a degree of trustworthiness to an article, but if you find that an article that is spouting the benefits of oil was funded by an oil company, those findings are likely biased.
2236 2018-07-05 20:21:47 We pay TV license for this BS? Do a bit of research, #UKOG DO NOT FRACK!! 

But yes they are about to flow test oil that gushed & could offer our country potentially billions of barrels of oil & bn£s to the Economy.

That is the REAL story & of REAL importance, Report on that!!!
2237 2018-07-05 20:21:47 Burning the midnight oil 
2238 2018-07-05 20:21:47 Forget about it....loool
2239 2018-07-05 20:21:40 Ate the round courgette today.
Just fried it in rapeseed oil with baby leeks and parsnip fries. It was really delicious :)
2240 2018-07-05 20:21:37 Just finished these two pieces.  The chair was blonde but very tired, the magazine rack was dark.  Both painted with Fusion Mineral Paint in Coal Black, the seat and the top have been finished with Fusion Hemp Oil
2241 2018-07-05 20:21:35 @ChryslerCanada what would you do if you dealer sevise dept let our new Ram 1500 with in 15k on it. In for and oil change drop it off the lift, over fill oil, NOT tighten oil drain plug??? I have emailed them called no reply??do I take it to the news?? #badservice
2242 2018-07-05 20:21:34 Please understand I must prepay for the CBD oil so this is why I am pushing to get it picked up as soon as possible.
2243 2018-07-05 20:21:33 Bret has been screwed so many times I'm surprised he hasn't struck oil.
2244 2018-07-05 20:21:31 #ScottPruitt is out! Make sure to check his bag and pockets for stolen items! Continue to investigate & make him pay back all his expenses on our dime! I'm sure he's got some oil & gas money stashed away! Up next #BetsyDeVos! #GOPCrooks #GOPCorruption
2245 2018-07-05 20:21:28 えぇ…水着着て引いたらお迎え出来るんですか…
2246 2018-07-05 20:21:27 So what anti-science, climate change denying, moron will Trump nominate to fill his spot?  I'm sure the oil and coal lobbyists are already calling.
2247 2018-07-05 20:21:25 Scott Pruitt's gone, now I wonder which corrupt oil company plant will take his place. There's always another swamp monster lurking.
2248 2018-07-05 20:21:24 BREAKING: Trump has nominated the wreckage of the Exxon Valdez Oil Tanker to lead EPA
2249 2018-07-05 20:21:22 particularly section 32(a)(a): \a distillate of crude oil that has all of the dearth of documents. It may be in Brennan Creek, whether 3/5
2250 2018-07-05 20:21:19 性癖はあくまで性癖だから
2251 2018-07-05 20:21:17 Now we'll have to see which oil company hires him. The oil boys love him sooooooo much! Boycott the oil company that hires Pruitt.
2252 2018-07-05 20:21:16 The higher fuel prices the higher the cost of food, pair this to a falling rand further steep price rises are a certainty since we pay for oil in $. There is less that the middle classes and the poor can afford to buy to eat. Yet we continue with insane policies like EWC.
2253 2018-07-05 20:21:15 Keep up the good fight. The @EPA has become a joke and someone needs to stop them. They are ignoring science and reality and just doing the will of the oil , coal and chemical companies to all of our detriment.
2254 2018-07-05 20:21:07 what a stunning coincidence that this prominent climate change denier and friend of the oil and gas lobby just so happens to be almost comically corrupt
2255 2018-07-05 20:20:58 Pruitt is out at last but America needs someone running @EPA who will focus on protecting our environment, not Big Oil.
2256 2018-07-05 20:20:33 My daughter has super sensitive skin. I've ditched the Aveeno lotion for coconut oil. For soap I want to try @amalbotanicals neem soap. Check their IG page. I think a bar is 1k5
2257 2018-07-05 20:20:18 Pruitt is taking his moisture lotion, and other spoils back to Oklahoma, where they appreciate corruption, oil spills, fracking earthquakes.
2258 2018-07-05 20:20:16 Trump's next head of the EPA is going to just be a barrel of oil with two googly eyes pasted on.
2259 2018-07-05 20:20:05 The next dude will still be an oil or coal exec
2260 2018-07-05 20:20:03 As a native Oklahoman I can tell you he is bought by the oil industry and does their bidding. Please return this heinous thing to another state.
2261 2018-07-05 20:19:55 The electric car uses oil products and other valuable minerals that need to be mined which also causes damage to the ecosystem. How do you win in this situation?
2262 2018-07-05 20:19:48 Gas prices going through the roof? Your solution: whine to Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. Immigration is a major problem:  Your solution: whine that the Democrats should do something about it.
2263 2018-07-05 20:19:46 性癖を現実とごちゃまぜにしてはいけない
2264 2018-07-05 20:19:46 Now that "Scott Pruitt" is supposedly gone, #MAGA by nominating a peer-approved, ethical climate scientist who works for the many & our future generations rather than a handful of old rich oil zillionaires on Trump's Special Interest & Re-election campaign list.
2265 2018-07-05 20:19:45 #ScottPruitt's gone, but let's not get too excited. Reports suggest his replacement will just be a sentient oil slick.
2266 2018-07-05 20:19:41 Well, we drained the swamp by putting private schools in charge of education and oil companies in charge of the EPA. Why not let the coal industry in too. I see no conflict of interest here.

*sarcasm font*
2267 2018-07-05 20:19:41 And after stole oil 
2268 2018-07-05 20:19:37 Steve Mnuchin waves away the woman massaging his face to answer his buzzing phone. "It's POTUS" he mouths to his wife, face down beside him. 

"Yes. Yes sir. I understand."

Sitting up, his flaccid torso slick with oil, he turns to her: 

"Lulu. It's time for the gloves again."
2269 2018-07-05 20:19:22 Don’t forget Beard oil & shirts with the sleeves cut off!
2270 2018-07-05 20:19:21 Still peddling your oil, I see. Stop harassing me with your libel and lies.

2276 2018-07-05 20:19:02 Now he's free to head back to Oklahoma and soak in his oil filled hot tub.
2277 2018-07-05 20:18:55 i don't wanna wear my glasses today and have the oil just sit on my face but i don't wanna waste a pair of contacts when i'm just sitting here in my underwear not doing anything
2278 2018-07-05 20:18:48 Pruitt & maybe even his wife will have a good paying job at a coal company or on the board of many oil and coal companies by the end of summer
2279 2018-07-05 20:18:46 Trump's toy submarine sank to the bottom of the straits They have to drain it to see where it is Big bonanza for Gulf Oil

2283 2018-07-05 20:18:38 They sat down to dinner with Putin as RU launched savage attacks on 5 cities in Crimea, making it look like usa supports barbarism. Lying traitor. Something to do with oil pipeline, to be sure. #KremlinCaucus

2285 2018-07-05 20:18:36 Just saw a tweet that yay, the EPA will no longer be in the hands of big oil. Now it’s King Coal. Great.

2289 2018-07-05 20:18:17 Which is code for “drill for oil,in Narragansett bay”

2291 2018-07-05 20:18:16 Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please. That's how we become Kings and Queens
2292 2018-07-05 20:18:14 A Christian? Really? Maybe with his own version of Holy Trinity: oil, coal and dollar. You can not be a Christian and worship money.
2293 2018-07-05 20:18:11 Yes, its oil free and water based so its very hydrating. Perfect for all skin types.
2294 2018-07-05 20:18:09 Restock! Oil burners, Incense boxes/towers, and a few new things! Check them out below 
2295 2018-07-05 20:18:06 The conspiracy theory that Trump owes Russia/Putin money is laughable in the sense that if it were the case the price of oil going up even in percentages would benefit Russia and Putin directly and in sums that would make Bezos look like a hobo
2296 2018-07-05 20:18:03 Trump’s tweets have added $10 to oil prices, Iran’s OPEC boss says
2297 2018-07-05 20:17:54 Use up all our resources first so if there's a war in the future, we're beholden up foreign countries? I'd rather use their oil during peacetime.
2298 2018-07-05 20:17:48 New satellite pictures reveal a massive oil spill in the Atlantic making its way toward Washington D.C. to apply for the open EPA Director position.
2299 2018-07-05 20:17:41 I'm in heels going through the Goodyear garage finding the guy that's doing an oil change on my car
2300 2018-07-05 20:17:32 Didn't take long to google him and find that he was a lawyer for oil and gas companys.   Figures.
2301 2018-07-05 20:17:30 Nope. September delivery of the first Yuan denominated Oil contracts.
2302 2018-07-05 20:17:14 I reckon I killed summer today. Applied not 1 but 2 coats of teak oil to the outdoor furniture...well actually had the 12 year old do it, so it will be his fault

2305 2018-07-05 20:17:03 Scotty, I got a bunch of antifreeze and motor oil left over from some car maintenance. Can I dump it in your yard and water supply?
2306 2018-07-05 20:16:55 This goes where oil goes
2307 2018-07-05 20:16:54 scott pruit has resigned thank god. go fuck yourself scott.

2309 2018-07-05 20:16:46 One of the health benefits of Palm oil is that it increases energy level.
2310 2018-07-05 20:16:44 It's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat, it's beef!
2311 2018-07-05 20:16:43 Do you have the data of Brent oil for bookmap?
2312 2018-07-05 20:16:41 USA must convert 1/2 our fleet to liquified natural gas, and increase domestic production, off shore drilling, fracking, and so on.  USA must produce our own fossil fuel energy, so that we do not need foreign oil.

2315 2018-07-05 20:16:36 Er yes. Actually they do. It's hidden in considerable subsidies for oil and gas exploration in the north sea.
2316 2018-07-05 20:16:25 I need to learn how to change my own oil. 
2317 2018-07-05 20:16:24 She sat down to dinner with Putin as RU launched savage attacks on 5 cities in Crimea. Lying traitor. Something to do with oil pipeline, to be sure. #KremlinCaucus

2323 2018-07-05 20:16:00 Let’s not forget: resignation is not a good reason to ever let this oil stain eat in peace again.
2324 2018-07-05 20:15:59 That better be some garlic-oil-sauteed kale!
2325 2018-07-05 20:15:57 @EPAScottPruitt 
Can ya do a boy a solid and let me dump my used motor oil in your yard and water supply?
2326 2018-07-05 20:15:46 Stir together 3 cups cereal with 3 pints daikon. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with chili
2327 2018-07-05 20:15:41 I bought some of their wig oil to help work through some of the little tangles/smooth down some of the flyaways, I'm just a noob on techniques. I'm gonna try to look up some videos to see how to clean up the curls while maintaining the shape!
2328 2018-07-05 20:15:41 That carrot oil been getting smashed in the lakes 
2329 2018-07-05 20:15:37 Check your Engine oil this morning.
2330 2018-07-05 20:15:36 Ja @EU_Competition Why are your rules of free traficking nog allowing to discriminate for environmental purposes? 
Equal treatment of oil and solar is ri-di-cu-lous
2331 2018-07-05 20:15:35 Coal's dying. Nobody doubts that. Oil is dying too but we're brainwashed to believe in it still. I'll take the pollution industry CEO whose career has an end in sight. Though literally anyone else would be ideal.

2334 2018-07-05 20:15:23 Don’t forget Norway dude... like it’s no different from Sweden (except the sugar expenses but that only reduces obesity so hah!) we’re one of the riches countries because of all of that gas and oil we have
Also no guns allowed unless you have a hunting license.
2335 2018-07-05 20:15:21 Interest rates rising,oil prices the highest in 9 years, inflation rising, the dollar falling around the world, wages stagnant or falling and effects of tariffs are just getting started, the debt has nearly doubled, tax cuts benefited only the wealthy,healthcare premiums rising..
2336 2018-07-05 20:15:20 So when did the NEB approve the downstream CO2 output on this project? Or is that only for Alberta Oil projects?
2337 2018-07-05 20:15:20 Sorry but liberals and patriotism is like oil and water! Liberals want to fundamentally change our country, they are not patriots nor do they have patriotism
2338 2018-07-05 20:15:15 “Pure some coconut oil on me in the name of love”. Hey it could be a hit. lol
2339 2018-07-05 20:14:51 See fool. You're exposing Africa and think it's Nigeria. I said it,internet has got most of u abandoned the efforts of ur forefathers,trying to find the elusive oil that will sustain ur country. The pics should start from Accra ur stinking capital.
2340 2018-07-05 20:14:49 The EPA has been destroyed. Now called the TDA. Trump destruction agency. You have sold public grounds to oil companies. You suck big time. Pruitt should yave been fired shortly after appointing.
2341 2018-07-05 20:14:45 Is it bright from the coal and oil burning? Because those industries are running @EPA these days.
2342 2018-07-05 20:14:44 Who's taking bets on his next job? (Thinking something in the oil & gas sector with a paycheck commensurate to his unique combination of slimy connections and lack of shame. That, or Chick-fil-A.)

2344 2018-07-05 20:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
2345 2018-07-05 20:14:31 There is SO MUCH OIL.
I could not believe how I had been lied to for decades til I came to Texas.
I am not against developing alternatives but to throw our economy in the trash over it is stupendously stupid. It is often forgotten but Trump trashing the Paris Accord was GREAT.
2346 2018-07-05 20:14:31 I felt like a proud parent tonight as Urban Veda's new Purifying Facial Oil beat over 40 entries to win GOLD in tonight's #FFSA18 for best Free From Facial Oil, and it was the runner up for Best Overall Free From Product too! Wahoo! Congrats @urbanveda #youdonegood
2347 2018-07-05 20:14:27 Don't let the door hit you on the way out!  How much you wager he makes the easy transition to oil industry lobbyist?  He is familiar with that line of work!
2348 2018-07-05 20:14:20 Shale, pipelines, refiners, prosper in high oil price differential 
Oil prices will increase to $80 maybe $85, to send China a message
Until China finally backs down and trade fair
FED is raising interest rates at fast rate despite trade war
ECB keep rates steady 2019

2350 2018-07-05 20:14:09 Pruitt was an awful choice from the very beginning. It was well known he would side with the oil industry and not with the citizens who want and need clean air and water.
His successor is not better than him.
2351 2018-07-05 20:14:09 Here are 5 things- 1)he’s a crook 2)he was utterly unqualified for the job 3)he’s a liar 4)he had no interest in protecting anything other than big oil and his bank account and 5)he is going to be charged with numerous ethics violations
2352 2018-07-05 20:14:07 I’m trying to understand u. How is Nigeria so rich in oil and other natural resources but so many of its citizens live in poverty? France doesn’t have hardly any natural resources but their standard of living is very high. Why do u think that is?
2353 2018-07-05 20:14:03 عاد قبل كم يوم كان في خبر عن تصدير اول شحنه كويتيه من النفط الخفيف sweet oil
2354 2018-07-05 20:14:02 it is insanity that our EPA chief can be in the pocket of the oil and gas industry. that they actively rolled back regulations on air, water, pesticides, etc. now we're getting one who lobbies for the coal industry. fucking idiots. environment > economics
2355 2018-07-05 20:14:02 He did exactly what Donald Trump told him to do. Destroy anything that Obama did to protect the environment. Everything, water, air, factories, oil, coal, you name it. We are living through some strange times.
2356 2018-07-05 20:13:54 Not entirely. The broad strokes of his theory led to a huge post-war boom (however most 1st world economies were manufacturing ones), Canada has been able to replicate it but using oil as a starting point. There hasn't been a comparable model in some time.
2357 2018-07-05 20:13:53 And that still doesn’t touch on the FACT I leveled at you (which you failed to respond to) that resources are not finite in the way that YOU mean them. We have more reserves of everything, including oil (which we were supposed to run out of in the early 70’s)
2358 2018-07-05 20:13:50 I make oil treatments for dark spots. I use it along with moisturizer to get rid of mine
2359 2018-07-05 20:13:48 If a bullet hits the Strait of Hormuz, the price of oil will rise to more than a hundred dollars, which will cause trouble for the whole world. More than that, Trump will not interfere with OPEC issues. This is not the way to destroy or ruin the Iranian government.
2360 2018-07-05 20:13:47 Is that because they're going to open up oil exploration?
2361 2018-07-05 20:13:43 Wonder what oil company the new guy comes from.
2362 2018-07-05 20:13:41 Crude oil tank kemaman bitumen company terbakar
2363 2018-07-05 20:13:39 And Trump will have to absorb that OPEC really can't make up the USA caused oil market shortfall @beaconinthemind @greatdefenderjm @Reuters
2364 2018-07-05 20:13:35 Really? Replacing one scumbag with another scumbag?
 Why don't you just be truthful for once!
 You are putting oil and coal lobbyists in charge of the EPA to remove all environmental protections so the fossil fuel industries can do what they want and poison us and the planet!
2365 2018-07-05 20:13:35 @cvpayne  EPA destroyed my Small Co. while protecting Big Oil. We were faultless. 50 laid-off employees. Wanna hear the Story?  Love your Work.
2366 2018-07-05 20:13:29 Protect or sell?  Your track record so far is to open these up to oil companies. Is that still the case?
2367 2018-07-05 20:13:23 So yes, the activist rich may like him because they're morons, but my bet it Big Oil will take a pass. So many better people in this admin to lead through their revolving door. Zinke comes to mind.
2368 2018-07-05 20:13:21 After his resignation Pruitt plans to live a quiet life and spend more time on his hobbies, like dumping barrels of oil into rivers, blowing cigar smoke in babies' faces, and shoplifting.
2369 2018-07-05 20:13:20 click these hashtags #IsraelGate #BakkenGate = proof of trump u.s. government treason and impeachable acts to oust most of the big oil, aipac owned government.

2371 2018-07-05 20:13:18 He wants to spend more time with his Big Oil Lobbyists
2372 2018-07-05 20:13:16 Seems republicans believe in big business who only care about profits and their shareholders...the main reason why we had to have regulations for clean water, clean air, banking,oil,..etc.
We've seen the enemy and the enemy is us
2373 2018-07-05 20:13:15 Pruitt was an awful choice from the very beginning. It was well known he would side with the oil industry and not with the citizens who want and need clean air and water.
Trump is no better than him.
He should resign as well.

2379 2018-07-05 20:12:52 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

2384 2018-07-05 20:12:43 ahhhhhh, I am not a supporter of the American foreign policy but if you block that oil you will be fucked like you haven't before.

America takes oil serious, more serious than nuclear weapons.
2385 2018-07-05 20:12:39 Nah, had other business to handle

2400 2018-07-05 20:11:44 Hey- please get an EPA director who will protect our health, and God’s beautiful places.  Not big business, or dirty oil.
2401 2018-07-05 20:11:36 What are you doing to “save the planet” Terrence?  Have you developed sustainable energy to replace oil?

2403 2018-07-05 20:11:34 He wasted tax payer dollars and gutted even basic regulations designed to keep people safe and the air (which you also breath) clean. That's not an outstanding job for the head of the EPA. That's an outstanding job for an oil lobbyist.
2404 2018-07-05 20:11:31 I'd imagine Pruitt will take a high-paying job at an oil company, but if he happens to want to enter public life and/or academia, maybe don't give him that job at CNN or that fellowship at Harvard? Maybe a bit of consequences for pushing climate regulation back a decade?
2405 2018-07-05 20:11:31 Another Appointment by Trump bites the dust. He was corrupt and did not care about the Environment. He was your puppet to dismantle EPA regulations for BIG OIL and Corporations.
2406 2018-07-05 20:11:26 But Tre45on has orders to do that since Russia's income depends on gas and oil.

2418 2018-07-05 20:10:42 Andrew Wheeler, lawyer & coal lobbyist, will be replacing corrupt @EPA Director @ScottPruittOK -- but don't expect ANY changes. His bio is frighteningly similar to Pruitt's. He's pals with @JimInhofe, another gas/oil whore.
2419 2018-07-05 20:10:38 Now that Scott Pruitt is out T**** is free to nominate the oil rig down the street as the next EPA chief.

2424 2018-07-05 20:10:24 Scott Pruitt has resigned. Apparently, he wishes to return to a life where he can ruin things on a smaller scale without the backlash, like pouring used motor oil down a storm drain... or parking a Hummer on the landscaping... or shooting solar panels with a BB gun.
2425 2018-07-05 20:10:22 Trump admin officials are probably furiously googling "Who was fundamentally responsible for the BP oil spill" so they know who to start recruiting for this fun EPA vacancy 
2426 2018-07-05 20:10:18 Trump says that he asked S. Arabia to increase oil production and they agreed. Saudi Arabia increased oil production 2 weeks ago and trump is trying to take credit for it for himself now. Our gas  prices went To $3.29/gal,2 weeks ago and then dropped to $3.05/gal. 10days ago!

2429 2018-07-05 20:10:06 Well since there is a yuge neo Nazi movement as well as an enormous survivalist attitude, they’ll welcome that snake oil salesman with open arms and ask him to enjoy their daughters and wives

2431 2018-07-05 20:10:01 They want a cut of oil money from Russia once they get sanctions lifted. Greedy soulless ghouls. Look at Wilbur Ross,still doing business with sanctioned Russian oil company,Now recently shorting stocks. The whole GOP has got to go!
2432 2018-07-05 20:09:59 USA needs to win trade war against China.  
EU and China now import much more oil than the USA.  
Every dollar that oil increases, makes USA put economic pressure on both China and the EU. Therefore USA wants higher oil price, regardless of what is said
2433 2018-07-05 20:09:58 My regular took my car to get the oil changed 
2434 2018-07-05 20:09:52 Long term, Canadian oil has an excellent future in the US as the US needs urgently more middle distillates to be diluted with shale. I expect more records this year.
2435 2018-07-05 20:09:50 How many more debts do Trump owe to the oil, gas, & coal industry corporations? I sure hope there is any decent environment left by the time we get rid of him.
2436 2018-07-05 20:09:49 Ah yes but did you know the chips at 16T are made of GM recycled cardboard and canola oil?

2443 2018-07-05 20:09:23 Not anymore, I’ve finally got it back, only took 2 weeks!! Yea who would put that amount of oil in, idiots! 
2444 2018-07-05 20:09:22 If a bullet hits the Strait of Hormuz, the price of oil will rise to more than a hundred dollars, which will cause trouble for the whole world. More than that, Trump will not interfere with OPEC issues. This is not the way to destroy or ruin the Iranian government.

2451 2018-07-05 20:08:38 Outstanding Job?? Outstanding for mega corporations, big oil, big power companies, big pharmaceutical, removal of all climate change and global warming language, dumping of waste into rivers and lakes, opening Forrests for drilling, opening our coasts and Great Lakes for drilling
2452 2018-07-05 20:08:37 There's a lot of coal, oil and gas lobbyists that can be put into political roles. There should be a law to ban them outright. #EPA #Pruitt
2453 2018-07-05 20:08:32 Rapeseed oil plant.
2454 2018-07-05 20:08:00 it takes like 10 iq to know not to stick your hand in boiling oil. Yikes
2455 2018-07-05 20:07:56 Behold the power of tea tree oil
2456 2018-07-05 20:07:54 俺今まで、リルちゃんレッドバロンとパーティーだったww
2457 2018-07-05 20:07:53 Don't be too excited.  The next guy up is an Oil Lobbyist and Climate Change Denier.  Without the scandals, I'm sure the EPA will quietly go about making this world worse for us all.
2458 2018-07-05 20:07:50 It is getting very old that all these politicians getting all this money from private organizations to do their will.Private prisons, tearing down forests for oil, killing animals to tear down the forests, etc. We elected them and they don't care, only pleasing the lobbyists.
2459 2018-07-05 20:07:44 @BudgetTruck gives Me a rental with DOG FOOD & DOG FUR all over the place. Rents Me a Truck 4,000 Miles over due for an oil change. Hangs up on Me 4 times in 3 Hours and you offer Me $35.00???
2460 2018-07-05 20:07:44 “Oil will not get above $40 a barrel again in my lifetime”. It took 3 weeks.
2461 2018-07-05 20:07:43 The "irreparable damage his regulation changes will do to our climate and our environment" are the only reasons Scott Pruitt lasted as long as he did given his dump-trucks of scandals. He gave Donald Trump's energy/oil/gas/coal and air/water/soil poluting donors what they wanted.
2462 2018-07-05 20:07:32 Blob of oil would do less harm.
2463 2018-07-05 20:07:31 I am a African American with Nigerian roots. I say take Shell Oil Company to every court you can. To the highest level of the  judicial system. Shell has made money of the resources in my ancestral home for years and the Nigerian government has allow them and others to profit.
2464 2018-07-05 20:07:25 ho messo una goccia di tea tree oil sull'afta al labbro inferiore e adesso sono anestetizzato dalla bocca all'orecchio.
2465 2018-07-05 20:07:21 dt considering 2 people 2 replace scumbag Pruitt as head of EPA: Joseph Jeffrey Hazelwood, Skipper of the Exxon Valdeze & Tony Hayward Head of BP during the massive Gulf oil spill who notoriously demanded his life back while others died. Both great choices for the treasonous scum
2466 2018-07-05 20:07:21 Trump will not do anything that does not benefit his own business.
Trump has created the largest deficit in US history
Trump has started trade wars with allies which will cause US goods prices to rise
Trump is causing oil prices to rise.
2467 2018-07-05 20:07:14 Why would we? We bomb kids for oil and keep em in cages for crossing imaginary lines. We’re actual fucking terrorists. Young people can actually see this.
2468 2018-07-05 20:07:14 Retweeted Top Conservative Cat (@TeaPartyCat):

BREAKING: Scott Pruitt resigned from EPA, saying he “wants to spend more time with all the money he got from oil and coal companies.”
2469 2018-07-05 20:07:12 Can't drink on the deck of the ferry because buttholes throw cups in the water. Guess the boat magically doesn't leak oil into the water either...
2470 2018-07-05 20:07:11 If by "done an outstanding job," you mean completely gutting the EPA, turning it over to oil and gas lobbyist, and using tax payers money to create a fortress for a paranoid delusional fraud; while constantly being under federal probe, than Yes, he was outstanding.
2471 2018-07-05 20:07:07 He’ll just go work for one of the big oil corps. I feel no sympathy for him.
2472 2018-07-05 20:07:04 Breakfast: 3 eggs, greens, and mushrooms sautéed in butter, olive oil, or coconut oil 
2473 2018-07-05 20:07:01 Came to get my free oil change at Toyota only realize my tags are expired and need be replaced and there’s a nail in my tire that can’t be fixed and I have to buy a new one 
2474 2018-07-05 20:06:57 Oil change a nice wash n detail ... time to stunt on em hooooesssss
2475 2018-07-05 20:06:39 So Scott Pruitt, EPA Director and twerp, has resigned. Andy Wheeler will step in and probably personally drown endangered species in oil ponds.  Maybe Andy won’t try to get his wife a Chicken Restaurant.
2476 2018-07-05 20:06:38 You've got him pinned to your twitter. I didnt realise i had to follow a strict set of rules when dealing with your rant against me. The regime could probably still get him back. If they bought oil for years off ISIS, then why not a foreign hostage? I can still I'm rattling you.
2477 2018-07-05 20:06:37 How unimaginative do you have to be to not be able to see a world without oil??
2478 2018-07-05 20:06:32 I feel sorry for you brother. You can thank CIA and US sanctions for your situation. They want your oil, and until they get it they will do bad shit to you.
2479 2018-07-05 20:06:32 And the new head of the EPA is a coal magnate. 

From oil to coal for the position that's supposed to regulate oil and coal. Seems reasonable.
2480 2018-07-05 20:06:24 BREAKING: Scott Pruitt resigned from EPA, saying he “wants to spend more time with all the money he got from oil and coal companies.”
2481 2018-07-05 20:06:23 If you go with “Pruitt Oil Spill,” you can shorten it to “POS.”
2482 2018-07-05 20:06:15 If you can't have carbs, what do you dip in your cheese oil?
2483 2018-07-05 20:06:07 Anybody who accepts semovita, Rice, Garri, oil and money in exchange for their vote in 2019. May the dry hefty thunder from Maiduguri strike them seconds before they even vote at all. Be lo se maje.
2484 2018-07-05 20:06:05 But the baby oil budget is through the roof
2485 2018-07-05 20:05:50 Thank you I have just been hearing about the difference in oil quality
2486 2018-07-05 20:05:32 Any truth to the rumor Scott Pruitt's resignation was written entirely in oil spill?
2487 2018-07-05 20:05:30 I assume Scott Pruitt is about to be replaced by a vat of burning whale oil that will steal all the EPA's office supplies.
2488 2018-07-05 20:05:24 @sheste77 I liked  the malt it was the cod liver oil i hated, i can still taste it to this day.
2489 2018-07-05 20:05:17 Those celebrating Pruitt's departure should note that his deputy will proceed w/same destruction of EPA in favor of gas & oil lobbyists...but without a clearly corrupt department head hobbling their "progress." Someone more intent on maintaining low profile may make things worse.
2490 2018-07-05 20:05:12 I then take the sally hanson cuticles remover and rub it on the heels of my feet and take a pumice stone in a circular motion and after that I take a scrub I made from olive oil and sugar and massage my feet with that rinse that off file my toenails down
2491 2018-07-05 20:05:11 For the World Cup quarter finals can we have all countries playing topless, please? And maybe some baby oil? Shorter shorts? 
Asking for a friend. #WorldCup2018 #WorldCup
2492 2018-07-05 20:05:09 The reason the prices of oil is high is because of your insane policies trying to cut Iranian supply. The price rise will hurt your supporter more than anybody else!
2493 2018-07-05 20:05:08 Me: Babe. Can you please take my car in. It’s saying I need an oil change, and they always try me when I go in on my own. 

Imaginary Boyfriend: Ya Baby. I got you.
2494 2018-07-05 20:05:05 Don't forget to mention that he was in the pocket of big oil.
2495 2018-07-05 20:05:00 английский. Или матан.
2496 2018-07-05 20:04:59 Remember when oil prices tanked and refineries and oil rigs in the U.S. were stopping production? Very low gas prices actually hurt oil industry workers because there is no profit margin.  It happened in 2016. 22% of oil & gas workers lost their jobs.
2497 2018-07-05 20:04:57 I need to oil my scalp
2498 2018-07-05 20:04:56 So does cooking oil, I wouldn’t shove that in a lock either.
2499 2018-07-05 20:04:52 Pruitt resigning is like taking one scoop out of a vast oil spill - necessary, but barely makes a dent in all the muck. 

#TrumpIStheSwamp
2500 2018-07-05 20:04:51 Let’s see, Bears Ear’s went to Uranium miners, The gulf went back to big oil, coal remains in West Virginia and PA and Keystone Pipeline clean up goes to the Native Americans. He’s the Oprah of pollutant promotion.
2501 2018-07-05 20:04:47 congrats to the new head of the EPA, a literal oil spill
2502 2018-07-05 20:04:44 @ChefSteps Do you have any tips for incorporating glycerol monostearate into recipes that don't call for it? Should I use it as a percentage of water/oil?
2503 2018-07-05 20:04:42 Congrats to the new EPA chief: the oil from the Dove wildlife cleanup commercial!
2504 2018-07-05 20:04:24 "Iranian demands"  why the crap is anybody giving that POS country--who desperately needs to sell their oil more than anybody needs to buy it-- the time of day???
2505 2018-07-05 20:04:23 Why do I have this feeling that a literal oil spill will be our next EPA administrator?
2506 2018-07-05 20:04:20 EPA agenda
Give oil companies free reign to-
Dirty your drinking water
Pollute the air our kids breathe
NOT protect our environment
2507 2018-07-05 20:04:20 And most have no idea how system works. Or how corrupt system is or understand corruption but sell it like snake oil for chasing dragon of materialism. 

No better than a drug dealer. ..homes without mirrors, it's all about me,me,me ..
2508 2018-07-05 20:04:19 What - no boiling in haz mat-laden oil?
2509 2018-07-05 20:04:16 01 Q: You really think my monthly chart shows 80 they really want maybe next year then A: no. they will try hold price high as long as they can
as Trump did. Trump not wishes lover prices just wishes stabile prizes as Sudies .#oott #usoil #crudeoil #oil
2510 2018-07-05 20:04:16 Bought off by big oil and coal. They are actually writing the policies for EPA. It's a sick joke. The world is suffering the consequences.
2511 2018-07-05 20:04:13 drumpf is proud of the wonderful job Pruitt did with the EPA by helping to make oil company CEOs richer and keeping those  good Obama rules to save the planet far away from THIS corrupt administration. Drop dead you losers.
2512 2018-07-05 20:04:12 @fordnation @DavidPiccini Well gas is up 12 cents per litre.   But the was the guarantee of a 10 cent reduction.  It seems you just made oil companies more profits.  #bullshit
2513 2018-07-05 20:04:11 And Canada continues to fight themselves and support foreign oil. Maybe in your next video, remove everything that is oil based (bet you can't do it!)
2514 2018-07-05 20:04:05 marvellous but did you bother cleaning up your oil pollution in the Niger Delta? Nah
2515 2018-07-05 20:03:57 This is so disappointing.  I wanted to see what Pruitt had in store next. Dipping his aides in gold bullion? Having Russell Westbrook declared his son? Purchasing the souls of those displaced by a new oil well? The possibilities were endless.
2516 2018-07-05 20:03:56 Pruit is a Bond villain and so before he's truly gone I expect him to have a last-minute act of evil, say, covering a pristine park in oil in a helicopter with a giant letter P on it.
2517 2018-07-05 20:03:51 #PollutingPruitt's replacement as head of the @EPA is a LITERAL COAL LOBBYIST. 

Big Oil is running our government, and condemning our generation to climate chaos. #BootPruitt #PruittBooted
2518 2018-07-05 20:03:50 They're bypassing oil and going straight to coal.
2519 2018-07-05 20:03:38 Any truth to the rumor that Scott Pruitt will just be replaced at EPA by a 55 gallon drum of fracking chemicals surrounded by an oil spill?
2520 2018-07-05 20:03:37 Pruitt out, long overdue. Who gets to pick up the bill, you've guessed it, the taxpayers get stuck with it. Environmental protection agency stripped so as to enable corporations to use public lands for oil drilling and coal mining.
2521 2018-07-05 20:03:30 I’m sure he’ll land on his feet at Big Oil
2522 2018-07-05 20:03:29 New oil, got gas?
2523 2018-07-05 20:03:27 Applied a gauze dressing to myself today and really felt like Jason Bourne. 

The wound was a self inflicted oil burn I got while cooking chicken without a shirt so I also don’t feel like Jason Bourne. 

Can’t win em all 
2524 2018-07-05 20:03:22 It’s about time Donnie we need to get Scott Pruitt gone we need to get our water safety controls back we need to get our public parks protected we need not drill   For oil in a public parks we need to protect our clean air we need to stop carbon fuel Imesions
2525 2018-07-05 20:03:16 Scott Pruitt is out. so who’s the climate denying oil baron with a top hat and handlebar mustache that’s gonna replace him?
2526 2018-07-05 20:03:16 2005
bread oil smooth for method
or

the to 2oz rest up clean
garlic bread
2527 2018-07-05 20:03:14 I've been at the dealership for almost TWO HOURS for an oil change. 

TWO HOURS.
2528 2018-07-05 20:03:13 Does this mean I don't get to pour used motor oil on his salad?
2529 2018-07-05 20:03:10 I hear the GOP's Big Oil donors are having a SAD over losing Pruitt.

Wonder who they'll make Trump hire next.
2530 2018-07-05 20:03:02 Back then the USG had Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iraq again, Sudan, Libiya, and Syria to keep itself busy with. Right now, there's nothing more suffice to the greed of neocons than an open market to 80 million potential customers and an endless oil supply.
2531 2018-07-05 20:02:53 Steamed and then mixed into the chocolate & coconut oil so it melts it all. Then blitzed until smooth. Add baking powder and ground almonds and that's it. Light and gooey at the same time. And good for you  *has another one*
2532 2018-07-05 20:02:50 The P stands for PROTECTION. The E stands for environment- you know , that thing that we are all a part of and utterly dependent on for survival? The thing that the oil and coal industries are poisoning? You truly live in bizzarro world. Objectively the worst EPA chief ever.
2533 2018-07-05 20:02:44 He's for sure going to end up as a lobbyist for big oil, or the coal industry.  They'll be more than happy to have him.
2534 2018-07-05 20:02:39 I can’t wait for chocolate oil cake on Saturday
2535 2018-07-05 20:02:39 That garbage bag has a plastic straw poking through the side so the oil drips on small animals as it wanders around town.
2536 2018-07-05 20:02:27 Obama made many specific claims on the campaign trail. When he says he's going to push EFCA, close carried interest, oppose the mandate, end MTR, back a public option, end oil/gas subsidies, etc. That's not voters projecting, that's voters taking a liar at his word. Sirota's pt.
2537 2018-07-05 20:02:23 The EPA replacement is just an embodied oil spill
2538 2018-07-05 20:02:20 Can’t wait to get home and *pour one out for @EPAScottPruitt 

*a barrel of oil into a nearby stream
2539 2018-07-05 20:02:18 "First, don't tell me how to run my shop. Second, no I don't."

Francis leaned on the counter, looking at all of the pipes he sold through the glass, only to be asked a question moments later. So, he turned his head and looked at the other.

"There's a chamber. Fill it with oil,-
2540 2018-07-05 20:02:18 Around the dosage I had. When you need (or have) to stop I will help you. I didn't stop taking them voluntarily, but was probably for the best, it'll only get harder with each passing year. DON'T be scared. Talk to your Drs. & I can answer stuff when you're ready. The oil helps!
2541 2018-07-05 20:02:16 Tremendous progress means 
Allowing drilling in national parks
Removing All pollution controls
Lowering emission standards
Removing funding to protect the Great Laked
Allowing oil pipe lines to run through water supplies
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS 
        DOUCEBAG
2542 2018-07-05 20:02:16 Additionally, supporting conventional oil and gas doesn't address the challenges of our time, and is a retrogressive step when genuine system change is needed.
2543 2018-07-05 20:02:06 We will be happy to see you there, Sheryl! Paul will be a bit upset that he wont be there, but this will give him some time to change the oil on his Criminal Apprehension Scooter. ^rb
2544 2018-07-05 20:02:04 Bye  Scott Pruitt, you human oil spill.
2545 2018-07-05 20:02:04 And the tarrifs start today.  Oh, how about that 40 bucks extra a month now going into the pockets of big oil.
2546 2018-07-05 20:01:56 Maybe we can now focus on what you are having the EPA do under your watch:
Dirty the drinking water
Pollute the air
Give oil companies more freedom to do 
2547 2018-07-05 20:01:53 Anybody that believes oil has gone up due to Trump tweets, got some swamp land for sale. 
2548 2018-07-05 20:01:52 Is that the oil monster from Ferngully? I had repressed those memories, man
2549 2018-07-05 20:01:38 I thought he was being replaced by an actual lump of coal, inhabited by the ghost of an 1850's oil baron
2550 2018-07-05 20:01:36 i thought it would be run by a barrel of Dioxin with maybe the oil barrel being the deputy head
2551 2018-07-05 20:01:29 How long before he's a lobbyist for oil and gas companies
2552 2018-07-05 20:01:24 Oil you have Ben they are mine 
2553 2018-07-05 20:01:06 For the love of the city
2554 2018-07-05 20:01:02 I’m glad like most that Pruitt resigned in shame but he should be in jail. He stole from the people of this country and should be held accountable. Hope he doesn’t slip on an oil spill on his way out the door!
2555 2018-07-05 20:00:58 Now instead of makeup and cheap clothes people on facebook are selling CBD oil.
2556 2018-07-05 20:00:58 I know I’m supposed to do regular maintenance on my car, but every time I go for an oil change there is something wrong. The something wrong always ends up being expensive. 
2557 2018-07-05 20:00:53 coconut oil and vaseline are good alternatives!!
2558 2018-07-05 20:00:52 Yeah I just had to do this. I have 3 kinds of oil now...
2559 2018-07-05 20:00:52 Oil and gas companies are embracing the digital revolution, looking for and finding ways to improve efficiency, grow revenue and create new business opportunities using digital technologies. @Hart_EPMag reports.
2560 2018-07-05 20:00:47 Babe, my skin is a mess right now. I need the scrub and body oil biko 
2561 2018-07-05 20:00:41 He ignores the sizeable chunk and punitive nature that taxes add to the cost. Rather he tries to blame big, bad oil. I am so sick of his patronizing bullsh*t and political pandering.

2564 2018-07-05 20:00:25 Scott Pruitt has resigned as EPA Administrator. He will soon be replaced by Trump's first choice: 

A square-mile wide lake of burning crude oil.

2565 2018-07-05 20:00:22 Probably because they read the Daily Mail or Daily Telegraph. Pro Oil Industry so total dis-information.
2566 2018-07-05 20:00:04 Thank you for saving my baby's idung mampet dear pure kids inhalant decongestant oil :) I owe u aloooot
2567 2018-07-05 20:00:00 Who’s grilling burgers and hot dogs this weekend? 
Save a little room for these easy to grill veggies –
Zucchini 
Carrots 
sweet potatoes 
Portobello mushrooms 
Slice, brush lightly with olive oil and throw in a tin foil packet. Grill for roughly 5-7 mins.
2568 2018-07-05 19:59:58 Thanks Scott for booking a Oil and Filter Change (Synthetic) with #Fiix for your Audi!  #North York #Toronto #Tech
2569 2018-07-05 19:59:48 My face was an oil farm stfu
2570 2018-07-05 19:59:45 sliced potatoes covered in olive oil and montreal seasoning then baked is one my favorite side dishes
2571 2018-07-05 19:59:44 I need an oil change but I don’t wanna go by myself lmao it’s so boring 
2572 2018-07-05 19:59:41 You need that lot plus black castor oil, almond, emu, avocado and apricot oils - the whole gang, organic and full strength because his scalp looks strong 
2573 2018-07-05 19:59:41 He has a soft landing spot back in OK politics or as an oil and gas lobbyists on capital hill. #swampy
2574 2018-07-05 19:59:39 EXTREMLY Risky but I am overnighting $RGSE overnight with this news still fresh and related to oil
2575 2018-07-05 19:59:38 It all about oil in the end. It can extend territorial limits.
2576 2018-07-05 19:59:37 No kidding, every time I walk out on my front porch I’m reminded of the months of hell endured of drilling and every day the crude trucks kicking up dust going to the well drilled across the road. He’s been in the pockets of big oil a long time.
2577 2018-07-05 19:59:35 And the coal mines are shutting down one by one. Because the coal barons are not investing in coal bu in gas and oil    Not many black coal miners are there.
2578 2018-07-05 19:59:34 Its only a win for corporations that support coal, gas and oil usage and has  no benefit to the people or the environment
2579 2018-07-05 19:59:33 Out with the oil man and in with the coal man.
2580 2018-07-05 19:59:30 He’ll dredge up someone even worse from his putrid oil swamp
2581 2018-07-05 19:59:16 I agree! Most likely sealed a deal with Russia regarding oil pipeline through their states. I wonder how much these people are getting from Russia for themselves?
2582 2018-07-05 19:59:06 Coconut oil really does end up being the answer to a lot of your problems.
2583 2018-07-05 19:59:06 You and Pruitt are corrupt!  The environment has suffered greatly, maybe irreparably, under you!  Environmental " Protection" Agency my ass.  The ONLY thing the 2 of you are interested in protecting are oil companies profits.  Definitely not the land/air/water!
2584 2018-07-05 19:59:04 Mama when are you ordering more body oil for yourself and to gift out.
2585 2018-07-05 19:59:04 Big Oil?  How about he’s an asshole crook.  Scott took himself down.  There were a dozen investigations opened on him and Bill Shine wanted to clean house.
2586 2018-07-05 19:59:02 So does he go off to lobby for coal? oil and gas? Maybe more carbon generally.
2587 2018-07-05 19:59:01 He’s off to make gazillions working for the oil industry
2588 2018-07-05 19:58:58 He making the oil company’s rich pay back
2589 2018-07-05 19:58:57 Headlines should be reading "Scott Pruitt, Earthquake Baron and Snake Oil Salesman, Leaves EPA, Goes Straight to Hell."
2590 2018-07-05 19:58:55 the hottest guy came into sally today for beard oil n we had a momENT he better come back for these digits 
2591 2018-07-05 19:58:47 Olive oil mayo or vinaigrette made in a high speed blender turn bitter.
2592 2018-07-05 19:58:46 Higher cost oil will drive more R&D into electric and alternative fuel vehicles which is good. Unfortunately the people who get hurt the most are lower income families who have to drive further to get to their lower wage jobs. We see this in the Bay Area, California.
2593 2018-07-05 19:58:25 So, instead of an oil lobbyist, a coal lobbyist! Holy fuckin shit!
2594 2018-07-05 19:58:24 If a bullet hits the Strait of Hormuz, the price of oil will rise to more than a hundred dollars, which will cause trouble for the whole world. More than that, Trump will not interfere with OPEC issues. This is not the way to destroy or ruin the Iranian government.
2595 2018-07-05 19:58:24 @ScottPruittOK About time they sacked you, you piece of crap. For trying to pollute and kill millions of people, I hope you fall into and drown in a pool of oil. And you're no Christian, you're the devil incarnate.
2596 2018-07-05 19:58:22 I went and got an oil change and there was a cute guy there lol not as hot as Levi obviously but still good
2597 2018-07-05 19:58:21 He probably has a job all lined up with one of those big oil companies!
2598 2018-07-05 19:58:16 Chop continues:
- DXY down (as expected)
- Oil down (as expected)
- FANG ramped (a e) - /NQ + 100 pts.
- USD/JPY pumped early
- Every other day green, red, green, red.
2599 2018-07-05 19:58:15 Some people are just ignorant & they are not worth tweeting to as they seek discord. The Middle East is a treasure & I just cannot wait for oil to be of no use. So we can go back to our science, astronomy, more healthy mental & spiritual pursuits then fighting with demons.
2600 2018-07-05 19:58:03 If oil refineries could be built here, there would probably be plenty of fuel here. Nobody has built a refinerie here since EPA came into existence. Was told you couldn't afford the fuel from it. Because of restrictions by EPA. That wasn't Obama, but sure ain't Trump.
2601 2018-07-05 19:57:55 I've never understood why @Greenpeace doesn't try protesting energy development in Saudi Arabia or Iran or Venezuela, that would really get your point across and show your commitment. But @GreenpeaceCA doesn't care about blood oil.

We should restructure parliament and have committees for particular ministries... No mp would allow a hospital janitor to operate them so why should we allow an s6 leaver to decide for a national about tax, oil, amendment etc.

The wrong people have the right office

2608 2018-07-05 19:57:35 For me Scott Pruitt resigning is huge news. I wrote my Master's thesis on how the incoming Trump admin would destroy the environment bc of White Evangelicals and Big Oil. I spent a large section on Pruitt. I'm SO glad he's finally gone, but I know the replacement will be as bad
2609 2018-07-05 19:57:33 I’m always shook when I see people on the beach using tanning oil with no spf...my pale, crispy self could never
2610 2018-07-05 19:57:28 I watched interviews Sunday where 1 farmer said he might suffer some but Trump was working 4 the greater good. 

SMH. 

People have fallen head over heels 4 this snake oil salesman & frankly, I don't think they'll ever hold him accountable because, Obama. 

Can't fix stupid.
2611 2018-07-05 19:57:24 BREAKING: Donald Trump says Scott Pruitt has resigned as EPA Administrator. He will soon be replaced by Trump's first choice. A square mile wide pile of burning crude oil.

2613 2018-07-05 19:57:17 why wasn't he fired?????  14 scandals ago??   mr trump is weak.  mr trump was being told to retain Pruitt by his swampy oil/gas buddies.   Mr "You're Fired"!!  Never had the testicles to do it himself
2614 2018-07-05 19:57:13 Why help you?  Ur all about Merica Alone!    Not like we don't have the oil. 
2615 2018-07-05 19:57:05 What's worse is it's all based on a distraction... we shouldn't even need oil in this century.
2616 2018-07-05 19:57:03 BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump nominates Armus, the black oil monster from TNG to replace @EPAScottPruitt
2617 2018-07-05 19:57:02 Awwnn thank u so much hun
2618 2018-07-05 19:56:57 He did good? Spending our money on unnecessary security and trips to sell petroleum products? Trying to get oil industry assholes on the EPA payroll? Those aren't good. Glad the fucker is gone.
2619 2018-07-05 19:56:56 The God I'm serving will not allow me to eat nonsense. No palm oil, no pepper, I'm very sure there is no salt. 
2620 2018-07-05 19:56:53 Yeah, so which members of the NEC have shares in a new oil refinery from Russia?
2621 2018-07-05 19:56:47 I will do love to see them when it gets to you!! And thank you! Yes, I’ll keep burning the midnight oil and keep the ideas coming!
2622 2018-07-05 19:56:46 Donors with oil and gas connections. Certainly.
2623 2018-07-05 19:56:45 About Fucking Time!  Pruit made a mockery of the EPA - protection my ass!  Pruitt & u Donnie are only interested protecting oil companies

While you're announcing Pruitt's resignation, y don't u announce your own resignation? USA will be much better off as soon as that happens.
2624 2018-07-05 19:56:36 ‘his feelings for adam were an oil spill; he’d let them overflow and now there wasn’t a damn place in the ocean that wouldn’t catch fire if he dropped a match.’
2625 2018-07-05 19:56:32 Scott Pruitt can now go back to doing what he truly loves: Throwing buckets of crude oil he illegally siphoned from a tanker into the Potomac River
2626 2018-07-05 19:56:31 Only one day off this week and I'm spending it by giving Dirty Dan a nice oil change and car wash  #beepbeepbitch

2630 2018-07-05 19:56:06 @FoxBusiness while tariffs hurt soybean growers I am sure thousands of dairy farmers would welcome lower soybean oil meal prices as it is a significant source as a protein supplement.
2631 2018-07-05 19:56:03 I wonder what job his wife got and what his next gig with big oil is.  His law degree should be revoked.
2632 2018-07-05 19:55:59 "what would you like for lunch?"

"oh, how about a bird covered in spilled gulf oil and singed over radioactive coal?"

"Oh, and get me a little child laborer to cook it."
2633 2018-07-05 19:55:45 Congratulations to a large barrel of oil on its appointment to run the EPA.
2634 2018-07-05 19:55:43 I wonder what job his wife got and what his next gig with big oil is.  His law degree should be revoked.
2635 2018-07-05 19:55:38 This oil gave me the giggles hard 
2636 2018-07-05 19:55:27 Holy crap! My oil lasts about a year. Granted, my car is newer, but sheesh.
2637 2018-07-05 19:55:26 Yeeeeeeaaaaaa! Now we can watch him replaced by an oil derrick with a wig.
2638 2018-07-05 19:55:26 Yep. Great job. Lowered CAFE standards, made our air and water less clean, held secretive meetings with the oil industry, wasted millions on travel and security, pen gate, secret calendar, cheap digs in DC townhouse owned by lobbyist, etc....
2639 2018-07-05 19:55:21 え、まって、釘そんなにない
2640 2018-07-05 19:55:18 @DawnDish Your oil slick laden baby duck commercial is shameful and dishonest, clearly you soaked the duck in oil specifically for the slo-mo filming while implying and credit taking from responders who actually do the clean ups. SHAMELESS @realDonaldTrump
2641 2018-07-05 19:55:08 Why do you think? 
All countries keep oil reserves in case of a oil boycott by OPEC countries or huge increases in oil prices. That way they can use the reserves to keep the prices stable. 
Our leaders decided they need the money in Dubai
2642 2018-07-05 19:55:08 Will the new guy go out and make money-making deals for Trump with the gas & oil companies? Pruitt was doing such a good job for Trump & that is why he looked away at the corruption, no skin off his nose!
2643 2018-07-05 19:54:57 Grifters gotta grift, every last opportunity. Betcha he ends up at an oil company making a million a year lobbying....
2644 2018-07-05 19:54:53 I burnt myself this is why I don't cook with oil
2645 2018-07-05 19:54:45 dude i was thinking about that. she gotta hit that texture feature, she looks like an oil painting.
2646 2018-07-05 19:54:38 Grapeseed oil has one of the worst Omega 6/Omega 3 ratios. It is industrially processed, extracted with chemicals and high heat like the other seed oils. Not a good option at all.
2647 2018-07-05 19:54:32 Oil companies have convinced South Africans that they import most of the Crude oil when they only import 50%.
2648 2018-07-05 19:54:32 An Israeli lipid scientist study found that adding even a small amount of C to stomach acids containing vegetable oil and iron from meat accelerated the #oxidation process, turning the oil into #MegaTrans (Deep Nutrition, p. 166).

2651 2018-07-05 19:54:22 I have a 2011 @Hyundai Sonata w/ a 2.4L GDI. I had my oil changed on 6/28. I check my levels today & it’s between the low mark & the bottom of the stick. I have no $ to address this. I guess this is just how @Hyundai makes it’s engines. OF COURSE it’s out of warranty.
2652 2018-07-05 19:54:18 Someone tell these guys not to compare Uganda to countries like USA UK in tax to GDP ratio. That’s like trying to mix water and oil. #ThisTaxMustGo @nbstv #NBSFrontLine

2655 2018-07-05 19:54:00 Honey, fresh grated ginger, fresh lemon slices. Combine em all and shove it in a jar and keep in the fridge. One spoonful of that per cup of fresh boiled water n ya got a nice throat easy tea. Also peppermint are your friend. Inhaling (through the nose) vic's, peppermint oil --
2656 2018-07-05 19:53:57 I was not talking about the recipe but the fact you consider oreos vegan, while they contain palm oil. It’s pretty paradoxical to consider palm oil is vegan... but whatever.
2657 2018-07-05 19:53:35 Oh for sure. Like literally just a sentient oil rig.
2658 2018-07-05 19:53:35 Oh great, we go from a former oil executive to a former coal lobbyist to act as the leader of the agency that is supposed to protect the environment. Trump really knows how to stock the swamp
2659 2018-07-05 19:53:33 You mean he no longer has his current job. Count down to accepting a job as a lobbyist or employed at an oil company.
2660 2018-07-05 19:53:28 Zeus and Penelope love making messes together they tore apart a chair and spilled oil that my dad had in the garage 
2661 2018-07-05 19:53:27 Hey! Scott Pruitt has just resigned he can take his tactical pants and special lotions and go.
I was concerned because overnight he’d surreptitiously mar my shorelines with oil rigs.
#Progress
2662 2018-07-05 19:53:23 Yeah some of the reaction to Beavertown has been insane. Why shouldn’t a business grow and enjoy its success? As for my view, as long as the quality of their beer doesn’t drop I don’t mind. I love Gamma Ray and Neck Oil.

2665 2018-07-05 19:53:01 Glad that Scott Pruitt finally got what he deserves *squints eyes* a 7 figure position lobbying for the oil industry
2666 2018-07-05 19:52:45 Congrats to a literal barrel of crude oil for replacing Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator.
2667 2018-07-05 19:52:42 I have a buddy who has a buddy... Whatever is leftover after the RSO will probably get pressed. Or I might make some butter and coconut oil. We'll see
2668 2018-07-05 19:52:36 And What about oil? First or After? XD
2669 2018-07-05 19:52:32 Pruitt is just gonna make an insane amount of money for oil lobbyists

2671 2018-07-05 19:52:23 Scott Pruitt has resigned as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and will be replaced by... *looks down at notes* ah, a Fully Sentient Amalgamation of Oil, Runoff and Noxious Gasses in the Shape of a Man. Congratulations!
2672 2018-07-05 19:52:09 Who cares about the oil producing companies getting richer at our expense..they have us over a barrel and we can’t do a damn thing about it..who cares about there trust funds for there grand kids..you must be in there pockets

2674 2018-07-05 19:52:00 Farage is a fucking snake oil salesman. The only thing that makes me seethe more than the completely concocted shite that spews out of his treacherous mouth, is the fact that there are vast swathes of idiots ready and willing to drink it all in. Sort your fucking lives out.
2675 2018-07-05 19:51:50 Are you saying a vehicle on a race track dumped oil? NEVAH!
2676 2018-07-05 19:51:33 I'll watch that video when I get home- leaving work to go get an oil change, super fun adult stuff! haha
2677 2018-07-05 19:51:21 They still got the car watch what you say they might put 4Ls of oil in your car and blow your engine  cos apparently people can do that 
2678 2018-07-05 19:51:09 Yea I just saw yo maw grinding at Speedee Oil Change lol
2679 2018-07-05 19:51:05 Oil companies produce half of South Africa’s Crude Oil needs locally.

But they sell the oil at import parity pricing instead of cost plus margin. They are coining it big time.

Imagine if KFC sold their chicken at import parity.

Most South Africans would not afford it

2688 2018-07-05 19:50:36 The worst-kept secret in the Mideast is that Big Oil wants control of ME oil resources to force the price up. Their nightmare has always been cheap oil. Look at who’s been invaded. #GregPalast wrote about it years ago in *Armed Madhouse.* It explains Venezuela, Iran.
2689 2018-07-05 19:50:33 He was seen leaving the office with a stack of calendars, some tactical polos and one used mattress - balancing on his head as he walked out.
Trump announced he will be replaced by an Oil Derrick.

2693 2018-07-05 19:50:07 You shouldn’t have accepted it, you should have requested it. 

He did a terrible job as EPA head- he did all the dirty work of gutting, ignoring the EPA staff and doing damage to the position for special interests like #oil and coal at the expense of the environment & taxpayers.
2694 2018-07-05 19:50:02 We are the number #1 oil producing country on the market now
2695 2018-07-05 19:49:58 Does that involve oil, s as well Caspar?. 
2696 2018-07-05 19:49:38 Scott Pruitt is going to get P-A-I-D now by the oil and gas lobby. 

No more Chick Fil A dreams or weekly rentals for him.
2697 2018-07-05 19:49:36 How is Iran closing the nautical passage through which 20% of the world's supply of oil passes none of our business? Crude would spike well above $100PPB, threatening the global economy and national security.
2698 2018-07-05 19:49:34 I beg to differ he understands fully looks like dougie is winging it he is costing ontario 420 million from get go .reality faces him now country on the right path lets get the oil flowing through those pipelines .Canada would see prosperity like it's never seen b4

Nuclear power plants, satellites, oil rigs... it’s a valid concern but nothing that should stop us from progressing and furthering the tech.
2705 2018-07-05 19:48:58 Change my oil & brakes this weekend Robyn need some TLC
2706 2018-07-05 19:48:56 Bruh I’m in here now bouta be 2 hours and they tellin me all this other shit. Just change my oil 
2707 2018-07-05 19:48:56 Outstanding job?? I do a better job protecting the environment pouring used crude oil into a storm drain. The guy was a con and a dumbass. No wonder you two got along.
2708 2018-07-05 19:48:55 What? This clown changed the whole structure of the ENVIROMENTAL AGENCY. No longer are there scientist on board. There have been secret agreements between this crook and the oil barons, the copper industry. There’s no clean water initiatives left.
2709 2018-07-05 19:48:52 Pruitt will now shift to what he seemed born to do: Consult or lobby for oil companies.
2710 2018-07-05 19:48:40 Vitamin E oil specifically.
2711 2018-07-05 19:48:38 Good riddance. A epa director bought and paid for by the oil companies. He was one of your worst appointees

I hope they keep breaking the ceilings, proving them all wrong & making fools of them. I, along with so many others, believe in him and Tesla. The planet needs Elon to win
2714 2018-07-05 19:48:27 With Pruitt out, the battle is on for new EPA head. Will it be a bundle of 1,000 plastic straws or a Russian oil spill? Find out on the next episode!

2717 2018-07-05 19:48:12 Reduce dependence on foreign oil, and OPEC would be a non factor.
2718 2018-07-05 19:47:52 @lisamurkowski might sell out Alaska’s oil for her vote, much like she did with our healthcare!!!
2719 2018-07-05 19:47:49 wow Trump just nominated the BP oil spill as his next EPA administrator
2720 2018-07-05 19:47:46 ...crude oil pipelines, like at Standing Rock (which very few Dems opposed); actively fighting leftwing economic policies like those AOC promotes; and there are others I could probably come up with if I had the inclination.
2721 2018-07-05 19:47:41 Next stop for Pruitt -- lobbyist for some oil company?
2722 2018-07-05 19:47:32 Ahh Thank you very much dear, maybe I didn't make my question clear ,I meant how healthy is it to the body cos I read something that says it's a very good alternative to nut oil but thanks too 
2723 2018-07-05 19:47:25 Just trying to scare markets and keep the oil price up I presume.
2724 2018-07-05 19:47:20 We are all British and always will be...
Thanks x
We are fishing for oil at the moment : )
2725 2018-07-05 19:47:16 OUTSTANDING con man; crookand THIEF of AMERICAN TAXPAYER’s money. 15 ETHICS investigations- in bed with oil/gas lobbyists - DID ZERO for American People- did everything a FASCIST REGIME THAT HATES democracy and AMERICA.

2728 2018-07-05 19:47:11 Thank you! Love olives—especially the ones marinated in olive oil #veganrecipehour
2729 2018-07-05 19:47:10 The spike in petroleum commodities markets are a direct result of the global instability & uncertainty YOU created by pulling out of the Iran deal. Who benefits? Russia & China oil interests. When gas prices go +30%, you’ll drain our strategic reserves to look good, hurting USA.
2730 2018-07-05 19:47:05 Scott Pruitt has only done an "outstanding job" of serving his own needs and the needs of the oil & gas industry. You have amazing low standards.
2731 2018-07-05 19:47:02 Ants' Revolutionary Guards Threaten to Cut Off Regional Oil Exports Amid US Pressure
2732 2018-07-05 19:46:58 Great fucking news! Until Trump announces that some Oil exec will replace him.

2745 2018-07-05 19:46:25 Apples and oranges are different fruits. As too is the price of oil and the US decision to intervene in regional conflicts. One simply has no impact on the other.
2746 2018-07-05 19:46:22 - coconut milk, egg, avocado
1 ripe avocado mashed, mix with 1/2 cup canned coconut milk, 2 tablespoons of Extra Virgin olive oil. On shampooed hair coat hair and scalp, cover with shower cap, and leave on for 20 minutes. Wash out with conditioner.
2747 2018-07-05 19:46:15 First, we’re going to coat the Gulf of Mexico with crude oil. Then we’re going to pay for a small fraction of the cleanup, pounding our chests the whole time. Then we’re going to fight clean energy initiatives.

Need I continue??
2748 2018-07-05 19:46:10 - Higher oil prices
- Higher Saudi oil production 
- increased risks of listing Aramco in International stock markets especially in New York. 
- Some National resistance of selling parts of golden egg
2749 2018-07-05 19:46:10 Does anybody take MCT oil?
2750 2018-07-05 19:46:10 Too much oil so I’ll pass
2751 2018-07-05 19:45:48 Idiots keep taking oil out of earth and than they wonder Why all bees and ancient trees die. Take all of the blood out of a man's body see what happens. GREED is going to kill us all
2752 2018-07-05 19:45:44 It's a good thing he was such good friends with the oil people because he is going to need an awful lot of lubrication.
2753 2018-07-05 19:45:41 I'm hesitant to celebrate. I'm sure Trump will nominate an actual oil rig next, or maybe a piece of real live coal.
2754 2018-07-05 19:45:39 Took 3 hours to get an oil change and tires rotated FML
2755 2018-07-05 19:45:38 Fish oil/ omega 3?
2756 2018-07-05 19:45:34 Arguably nickel and dime funded grassroots “save our environment” bogeymen have “scared” away a massively subsidized American oil pipeline company whose only motive is squeezing the highest profit out of any transaction.  I give you that.
2757 2018-07-05 19:45:33 Yes Norway has a dirty secret, and that's the fact that they are a still issuing new oil and gas licences. But it's nice to be able to have a long shower without feeling guilty too.
2758 2018-07-05 19:45:33 scott pruitt will now be punished by making tens of millions of dollars as an oil lobbyist
2759 2018-07-05 19:45:28 Pin a rose  on you, publicity seeker.
2760 2018-07-05 19:45:24 This is an advertisement for a fake product -- which I am now going to get deleted from Twitter -- you are a snake oil saleslady -- get the F**K outta here.
2761 2018-07-05 19:45:23 Buh-bye Scotty. I'm sure there's an oil company dumping toxic waste in the air, or a company dumping chemicals in the water that causes childhood leukemia, so you'll be fine #hero
2762 2018-07-05 19:45:22 - egg, avocado, and olive oil
2 egg yolks, 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil, and half of a ripe avocado. Mash avocado and mix in egg yolks. Coat hair, cover with shower cap, and leave on for 20 minutes. Rinse with cool water and then proceed to shampoo and condition as usual
2763 2018-07-05 19:45:19 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2764 2018-07-05 19:45:12 Maxine Waters is not telling anyone to shoot someone. But of course Republicans and the NRA gun lovers think that’s it. Believe it or not people actually use the words to get their point across. We have that right guaranteed by the First Amendment
2765 2018-07-05 19:45:05 Coconut oil and tropics
2766 2018-07-05 19:45:03 Your EPA has literally taken steps to further destroy the planet and make people sick.  Republicans are the only political party in the world denying climate change.  the last political stronghold for big oil.  Millennials are about to take you down.

2773 2018-07-05 19:44:23 sorry didn't think of dif goodnight
2774 2018-07-05 19:44:08 Stop buying OPEC oil. With all the oil we have we don't need to buy theirs just to fund their terrorist organizations. We need to get away from archaic fossil fuels anyhow. With solar,electric,wind and even nuclear, why are we still using oil? #NoOilFromOPEC
#WALKAWAY
2775 2018-07-05 19:44:08 Yes really. Hidden subsidies cannot make fossil fuels cheaper than renewable energy. Shale oil, oil sands most expensive. Now come electric vehicles—Tesla now making 5000 Model 3 EVs a month. Fossil fuel producers becoming unprofitable.

And all that is good, fossil fuels dirty!
2776 2018-07-05 19:44:08 .@realDonaldTrump 

Your Trompe l’oeil for Trump Oil$$ is going well, I see.

You cry "Lower oil prices!" knowing the prices will then rise to support your & @PutinRF_Eng's (and many @GOP) Rosneft riches wet dreams.
2777 2018-07-05 19:43:50 I hate ticks. I am constantly finding them on me. I found putting a drop of tea tree oil on them will cause them to back out. I wait a minute after putting it on before removing with tweezers. HATE THEM!
2778 2018-07-05 19:43:47 Slice off tops. Drizzle olive oil. Roast them in tinfoil, 40 mins at 180.
2779 2018-07-05 19:43:47 Russia wants nothing more than for Iran to get loads of its men killed in Syria so Putin can keep Assad under thumb. 

Once the war's over, Putin'll do everything possible to put Iran in a box. Including working with the US. 

(Ancillary benefit: Competitor in oil out of game.)

2785 2018-07-05 19:42:57 Congrats to new EPA Administrator Big Oil.
2786 2018-07-05 19:42:53 Its not only the Rand exchange rate that matters... Oil prices have risen from about $30 per barrel to $70 per barrel... This is due to American Sanctions on Iran & Venezuela..  plus unrest in Syria & Libya... Expect them to keep increasing
2787 2018-07-05 19:42:40 Thank God! Scott Pruitt resigned as head of EPA where he worked for big oil to kill our environment and children's future. Good riddance!

2799 2018-07-05 19:41:51 You added 1.5 trillion dollars to the National debt and you have not stopped Pruitt from wasting taxpayers money. I don’t think your leader understands international oil prices and how his trade policy is taking away any savings for the working class to pay for gas =embarrassing

2805 2018-07-05 19:41:32 Congrats to Scott Pruitt on his future lobbying gig with an oil or mining operation.
2806 2018-07-05 19:41:32 The price of oil went up because of the deregulation of trading in oil futures.  Investors worried about the value of the dollar used oil as a secondary currency.  Reinstitute those regulations and watch the price fall.
2807 2018-07-05 19:41:31 How about we keep more of the oil we pump in the U.S. IN the U.S.

2810 2018-07-05 19:41:08 Invade and annex Mexico they already built a wall on their southern border. It would help you drug war types and end the border crossings. Mexico also has oil 
2811 2018-07-05 19:41:07 yes oil is volatile, currently it's just below $78 per barrel, in a year it could be $20 or $120
all the mmore reason why any income fro it should go into a fund and be kept separate from the rest of the economy

Those 7 GOP guys in Moscow. Kansas, Texas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, all have existing Keystone oil pipelines, or are states slated for Keystone XL extension. Louisiana & Alabama have major oil & gas deepwater ports.
2837 2018-07-05 19:39:34 In case of oil what matters most for China is diversification of its sources. Iranian discounted oil sales priced in CNY will pay cornered Iran & China bilaterally.

Comrade President political instability coupled with NAFTA sabotage of our two largest oil suppliers Canada & Mexico have caused a dollar a gallon increase

2862 2018-07-05 19:37:14 What a bunch of misguided group of individuals. I guess they have a need to feel like they are important and gives them a sense of purpose. They should be protesting the import of Blood Oil instead!
2863 2018-07-05 19:37:08 Was trying to get you to slide in @Hotti_Audi  dms. But originally you were needed to slide into @Jake_cowen12  so I got some baby oil if your having trouble sliding in 
2864 2018-07-05 19:36:53 #SheaMoistureUK The Shea Moisture Black Castor Oil Conditioner is definitely my staple! Although I do really want to try out the Protein free range as I've heard good things 
2865 2018-07-05 19:36:47 Because of his brilliance and because possibly he wants their oil.
2866 2018-07-05 19:36:47 I dunno what’s happened. We saw a Mustang towed off but we’re still under red. 

I assume it dumped all its oil on the track. I’ve seen that happen.
2867 2018-07-05 19:36:42 Snake oil!...
2868 2018-07-05 19:36:34 Presumably they'd be all in on an oil shock explanation
2869 2018-07-05 19:36:32 助言ありがとうございます！
まだまだ先だと思ってたらダメですね
2870 2018-07-05 19:36:21 This sucks, Scott. How high did it get on the car? I'd pull the dip stick and see if it looks like there's water in the engine (oil would look milky). If so, I wouldn't try to crank before changing the oil.
2871 2018-07-05 19:36:17 Olive oil is a lifesaver when your ear produces to much wax just saying 
2872 2018-07-05 19:35:58 Don’t forget coconut oil and lavender. Apparently, along with turmeric, they solve everything.
2873 2018-07-05 19:35:58 OPEC intentionally tanked oil prices for the past 5 years by flooding the market with the sole intent of putting pressure on U.S. producers who couldn’t compete at $30/barrel ... we are just getting back to levels that could support American labor again ! Let oil rise !
2874 2018-07-05 19:35:57 We need alternatives, hence not promoting oil companies that want to maintain our dependence on oil until not profitable, despite it damaging us.
2875 2018-07-05 19:35:57 Boss In Oil In This St. Patrick's Day Celebrations In Case He Needs To Hospital For 'The Reinforcin'
2876 2018-07-05 19:35:53 You realize, Josh, that that is far too subtle and nuanced an argument to ever be capable of penetrating that brain which is even smaller than his fingers.

BTW, what country most benefited from the hike in oil prices following the scuttling of the JCPOA?  start with an R.
2877 2018-07-05 19:35:50 “Lies” that were upheld when the oil price crashed & all of the predictions in the white paper never came to pass. Same argument as Brexiteers about scaremongering. Gonna have to do better than that.
2878 2018-07-05 19:35:48 Hi Daveyboy....midnight here,,,but bear with, anything for you!!!
2879 2018-07-05 19:35:46 Yes Sir Mr President ... If people can stop buying gas completely for a week .. it would let OPEC swim in oil and watch their profits dive
2880 2018-07-05 19:35:45 woke up in paradise valley immediately juiced turmeric ginger lemon and rubbed fermented rosemary and olive oil into my scalp
2881 2018-07-05 19:35:44 South Africa produces half the crude oil locally.

That negates the impact of not only the Rand dollar weakening but increase in crude oil prices.

The SA Oil industry has lied to South Africans about the murky pricing methodology.

They use import parity pricing to fleece SAns
2882 2018-07-05 19:35:42 To the media’s credit. They quote me on Tesla everyday. Maybe Tesla should play with the same playbook as the oil and coal industry. I might bring that up to @elonmusk
2883 2018-07-05 19:35:42 I personally believe Elon Musk is getting criticism from the big news media because they might have their hands in the big oil companies and want Tesla to fail.
2884 2018-07-05 19:35:41 Well worth it. Flower still > oil
2885 2018-07-05 19:35:34 No OEM has stated that Tesla is their competition yet you’re saying they’re going to beat Tesla. Why are oil and gas execs donating money to a lawyer fun form some that sabotaged Tesla for months
2886 2018-07-05 19:35:30 جزاك الله خير
2887 2018-07-05 19:35:20 I’m not paying any more men to change my oil. This man just said $50. $50 for what?! Ohh noooo YouTube here I come. Fuck all that .
2888 2018-07-05 19:35:17 Dearest Ira,
We have stopped at the #RedHen for rations kale chips & soy lattes, before proceeding behind enemy lines. We follow Gen. Maddow in a stealth raid. We have soaked 2 tons of raisins in CBD oil...will mix in their potato salad then strike. #secondcivilwarletters
2889 2018-07-05 19:35:07 Don't forget OPEC rased the price of oil because.
1. We support Israel.
2. We are infidels.
They will smile at us then stab us in the back.
2890 2018-07-05 19:35:05 Next thing you know, Trump will think it might be a good idea to impose tariffs on oil imports.

2892 2018-07-05 19:34:42 This was so easy and very fast even I got suprised <3
Just cut one scallion & fry it for a bit in oil. Then add arrabbiata pesto(spicy) & 1dl water. Cook for a while. Boil fresh pasta & aspargus together. Add shrimp & parsley in the sauce and get it warm but don't boil the shrimp

2898 2018-07-05 19:34:11 It blows me away that people out there really still think women shouldn’t have certain careers. Got a snap stating “woman shouldn’t work in the oil field only if they are a medic”. Excuse me sir who does drugs before his shifts, I could learn your job and replace you.
2899 2018-07-05 19:34:04 Tools of the oil and coal industries. Of course ...
2900 2018-07-05 19:34:02 I'm no expert, but oil producing countries like it when the price of oil goes up cause... you know... math.
2901 2018-07-05 19:33:52 Just called 20+ Firestones tryna get a oil change scheduled today 
2902 2018-07-05 19:33:49 I support your efforts to reduce consumption of fossil fuels but we are not near the point where we will not need them. I also support using tax dollars from oil to fund green energy.

2904 2018-07-05 19:33:39 The exact same thing is now being investigated in the UK over Brexit. They have their own non-believers too. It baffles me, mining, banking, and oil companies in bed with politicians. Cambridge analytica. I think revenge for destruction of the Russian empire.
2905 2018-07-05 19:33:27 Maybe used engine oil, a kitchen knife, mattress, fan belt and what looks like old engine parts are now the tools or proceeds of rituals.

2907 2018-07-05 19:33:02 I just sent this to a senior colleague in the oil and gas sector who’s based in UK. He will be a better fit for your audience. He has a PhD in petroleum Geology and presently works with one of the biggest oil companies  in Uk.  I just hope he’ll have the time.
2908 2018-07-05 19:32:55 Hope you all had a wonderful 4th! I personally had a lovely BBQ with my master @NancyPelosi and a few of our friends from Big Oil! They are always so generous with their donations!
2909 2018-07-05 19:32:44 I worked on the gas pipe line from the top of Scotland, all the way down to Southampton , then working on Oil refineries,  then Wind power . Loved it all, sadly I worked mostly at heights or low down within the legs of Oil Platforms  in the north sea
2910 2018-07-05 19:32:33 Went 2 dinner alone. Sat by an oil couple reassuring a German patron how fab 45 is for the great changes he’s making happen in the US. A third table discussed how extreme the Left has become...how it hurts our cause. So nauseated, I returned my wine, paid & went back to my hotel.
2911 2018-07-05 19:32:29 Ditto to Ivan. I still think "oil and honey" to myself sometimes.
2912 2018-07-05 19:32:18 I think a lot of casual fans overlook the Sekera impact. Oil dragged around a $5.5-million black hole, owed entirely to injury. If he comes back 100% (not a given), you substantially elevate about 22min per game on one side of your D. That’s a huge deal.

2924 2018-07-05 19:31:09 First oil does not just make the top 1% wealthy and everyone else peasants. Two the oceans is polluted via littering and over fishinging. Three food that’s being grown now is being poisoned by the people growing it using pesticides, due to over population and higher yield needed
2925 2018-07-05 19:31:03 Fuel efficiency tips
Use multigrade oil in your engine because it reduces drag, Switch to radial-ply tyres, Avoid stop-start driving, Accelerate slowly, and Close the car windows when driving.

2939 2018-07-05 19:29:18 You may hate them, but they're right. Sanctions on their oil drives demand and price elsewhere. And where is all the bravado about being self sufficient disappeared to?

2942 2018-07-05 19:28:32 Amazon basics dog bags that has a dispenser that clips to the leash are a lifesaver if that's not in your order. Also we learned yesterday CBD oil for if it gets freaked out by fireworks is a fucking miracle.
2943 2018-07-05 19:28:22 Last three days of shake out in oil markets is very normal. Physical inventories are very tight and disruptions are already occurring or imminent in Libya Venezuela Canada lack of US pipelines for Permian. Prices looks like are going up at least in the next couple of months
2944 2018-07-05 19:28:16 If I anything else gets powdery mildew, put 2 Tbs of bicarb in a gallon of water, add either 1tsp washing up liquid or 1/2tbs oil (to help it stick) mix well and wet all the leaves with either a sprayer or a watering can rose. Do on a dry day if poss, repeat if necessary.

2965 2018-07-05 19:26:14 Right, that’s one reason we have huge oil deposits
2966 2018-07-05 19:26:11 Of course. But no amount of cost cutting short of hobbling infrastructure ala Klein will get us significant revenue gains. Happy to hear of an alternative but the simple reality is we bet on oil returning to previous levels. That’s probably a bad bet.

2968 2018-07-05 19:25:36 I don't have much information about car but if I have to guess, something could be wrong with the engine, the cooling part of the car (where you pour water in so it don't overheat) or maybe something wrong with the oil tank.

2977 2018-07-05 19:24:09 Taxes and we sell most of our oil and gas to the States at a huge discount and get screwed on the dollar exchange, just to buy the finished product back at a huge mark up and then taxed again. Fucking brilliant.
2978 2018-07-05 19:24:04 No. I don’t. I think business insider is putting out crap.  And that reporter should have her financials checked. Love to see her OBAs. I do think the oil industry and shorts want Tesla to die as Tesla will kill their business over time.

2982 2018-07-05 19:23:53 If you think Russia like Trump. Your pretty stupid. Because of sanctions and the US now supply oil for three countries that dropped Russia. I don't think Putin likes us very well. We are killing there economy.

2987 2018-07-05 19:23:13 I’m well aware. Our oil production destroys our ecosystem. Some folks don’t care. I cannot teach you to be analyst. It’s too tiring to try to get you to understand PMESII. Takes years to become proficient. Sleep well with your beliefs. I’ll worry about the truth.
2988 2018-07-05 19:23:11 Isn’t it obvious thay are just trying to scare the market to keep oil prices up? It costs nothing to make a statement but could potentially make billions for them.
2989 2018-07-05 19:23:11 We could even rename it the Gammarena or the Neck Oil Drome - there's so much of the nectar drunk there on match days 
2990 2018-07-05 19:22:58 No, it's a matter of necessity. Let's break it down realll simple for ya. Does a cow need to be killed for beef? Okay, do calves need to be prevented from drinking their milk for dairy? Still following? Right here's the big one, do orangutans need to be killed for palm oil?

2993 2018-07-05 19:22:39 I just looked at my oil change sticker thing... it says i should of gotten a new oil change in April... bro it’s July. I hate my life 
2994 2018-07-05 19:22:37 It had way too much oil, but was dry at the same time. Instant heartburn. Shortening-based, synthetic-tasting icing. NO cocoa.

I'd be nicer if the baker wasn't being a snooty braggart about their work. Because they certainly had no reason to be. Blegh. 
2995 2018-07-05 19:22:14 I don’t see how 45 can complain about Iran’s oil production and pricing after withdrawing from the nuclear deal.

2998 2018-07-05 19:22:02 It's obvious in which direction we're moving, but we remain highly dependent on oil for the foreseeable future.

3001 2018-07-05 19:21:44 I scheduled an oil change for my car for Tuesday , had to reschedule for today because there were problems at my site , now i have to reschedule again because once again there’s problems at my site

3003 2018-07-05 19:21:40 If Trump invaded Venezuela, what’s left of our country would be parceled out piecemeal between Big Oil and Russia. It would be jumping from the fire into a vat of gasoline.
3004 2018-07-05 19:21:26 i’m in westerly getting my oil changed do i do a loop around watch hill after
3005 2018-07-05 19:21:22  What kind of oil?
3006 2018-07-05 19:21:19 Our power grid blows 1880 oil dicks.
3007 2018-07-05 19:21:17 Poking around I'm seeing some "it could draw moisture out of the skin if there isn't enough moisture in the air" and "it isn't moisturizing enough for dry skin." My manicurist said something about it not being a good moisturizing oil. No idea of the veracity of any of that.
3008 2018-07-05 19:20:56 軽く調べてみましたが、精神科や心療内科等で受けられるんですね

3009 2018-07-05 19:20:54 cannabis oil is recommended for that, helps with anxiety and depression. It's derived of marijuana, but it's more medical and doesn't have the active (thc) which is generally non medical. there's natural remedies out there. another is lavander for the same anxiety + the other!
3010 2018-07-05 19:20:47 Yeah, when you were in power during peak oil in 2008 and it was $1.50+ / litre, where the hell were you? Oh yeah creating surcharges on things like @BCFerries @bchydro jacking MSP and all other kinds of fees. Go crawl under your criminal underworld rocks and go launder yourself.
3011 2018-07-05 19:20:34 Coconut Oil
3012 2018-07-05 19:20:26 Interesting to note that the deforestation causing the awful loss of habitat also comes from many other crops. Wonder if you boycott those too? Get real and realise that you're general person can't cut out animal products and palm oil with it being in so much, great that you can.
3013 2018-07-05 19:20:16 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
3014 2018-07-05 19:20:10 And here come the players! As I speak to you now, the captain has his crosshairs zeroed in on the oil rig! He's at periscope depth. It looks to me like he's going to attack! By the way, did you know that a submarine captain earns 200,000 dollars a year?

3017 2018-07-05 19:20:05 We’re all going to die because oil and coal aren’t done making money yet.
3018 2018-07-05 19:20:04 Lazy reporting, BP will be happy to pay much more later IMO. Must admit to selling some this am to fund #YCA, timing might be fortunate as oil seems to be coming off a bit on Aramco news
3019 2018-07-05 19:20:03 We had another starter of baked mozzarella in Parma ham, bread and Olive oil/balsamic and olives. We'd cycled to The Rope and Anchor in Dunham Massey.

3028 2018-07-05 19:19:07 So yesterday I gave my bro cannabis oil and for the first time in months he was able to sleep in peace without any seizures 
3029 2018-07-05 19:19:07 Yeah send the DEA into VZLA to arrest the NarcoSocialist regime and get their oil fields back producing.
3030 2018-07-05 19:19:07 What in the actual fuck are you talking about. People who are pro pipeline to sustain an ability for millions of Canadians to provide for their families, cut off the dependence on oil imports from middle eastern country’s has absolutely nothing to do with anything you just said.
3031 2018-07-05 19:19:03 Haha amazing. Baby oil is his friend.
3032 2018-07-05 19:19:00 Has going higher without a production cut is a sign of a solid Econ plants open freight delivered EPA was so over the top no issues drill drill drill FYI we produce more oil than the Saudis just saying

3038 2018-07-05 19:18:25 People are protesting but protests can't be heard through the shower of dollars falling from oil companies, private security forces, and oil companies. Answer for change=money out of politics. Also any group will use information as long as it supports their agenda.
3039 2018-07-05 19:18:19 Well, Alberta’s latest energy auction was won by subsidy-free renewables, China is deploying enough electric buses each month to eliminate demand for 5,000 barrels / day of oil. So the tide has clearly turned. There’s no appetite to go back (apart from the US president)
3040 2018-07-05 19:18:06 O'Western civilized ur wrong policy claims n declares dat muslim is terrorist n islam is terrorist religion bt world didn't accept ur oil greedy mindsets.If u say something our blvd prophet den listen carefully We'll never ever accept this heinous crime.#CompeteProphetUniversally
3041 2018-07-05 19:17:53 They are trying to keep oil prices high. This kind of talk comes on the heels of Trump orderering the slaves (KSA) to increase oil production.
3042 2018-07-05 19:17:50 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
3043 2018-07-05 19:17:46 So the US need the somali oil crude badly. why now the #WRW is shouting? anyways it got to be investigated for the sake of our somali people!!
3044 2018-07-05 19:17:44 And oil isn't subsidised? Bahahahaha
3045 2018-07-05 19:17:44 Coconut oil or a moisturizer for dark spots
3046 2018-07-05 19:17:40 . . that the oil scraper rings on vintage big-block Chevys would go out around 35K miles. I've owned a dozen of them & everyone of them needed rings by 40K miles.
Must head to a job-site now. Really enjoyed the visit, my friend.
3047 2018-07-05 19:17:34 Aren't you listening; not when oil isn't the right price, which incs 19 of the last 20yrs & you're forgetting 250 oil-free yrs too, and that Scotland gets all the revenue, fgs your very own much-loved SNP even say so in their capacity as scotgov.
Jings and crivens.
3048 2018-07-05 19:17:14 I got a buddy who is insanely into him, so I checked out some of his stuff. After about 5 minutes you realize it's just the usual self help snake oil. Crazy how people buy into it & make this guy rich by saying the most cliche/obvious bullshit.
3049 2018-07-05 19:17:10 Again, I didn't say you had to buy oreos that contain palm oil. Can you please remember that you're criticising a joke tweet about how vegans often eat oreos? Let me ask you this, do animals NEED to be exploited to get meat? Milk? Palm oil? Spot the difference.
3050 2018-07-05 19:17:03 You should know how the fuel prices fluctuate or else you should not put the fuel challenge.

After the the pressure from trump government to reduce  oil imports from Iran the oil prices will certainly rise.
3051 2018-07-05 19:16:55 go and look it all up for yourself, you'll be amazed how healthy Scotland's economy actually is WITHOUT OIL
the white paper for 2014 did not base Scotland's economy on oil, stop and think, anything from oil was earmarked to set up an oil fund
you've fallen for the unionist lie
3052 2018-07-05 19:16:50 Not to mention regular suntan oil applications

3059 2018-07-05 19:15:37 Grow a pair, invade Saudi Arabia and take the oil! Don't be a wus, do it!
3060 2018-07-05 19:15:32 The language used is strategic movements.  Nation/Alliance A moves into a nation, nation.Alliance B then follows...using their networks, polarise the nation, fund each side...then the tax dollars flow...you get oil, mineral, telecom resources, etc...etc...
3061 2018-07-05 19:15:22  by that you mean THC oil I guess haha
3062 2018-07-05 19:15:15 Common interest being, lifing sanctions because Exxon has a pretty penny stuck in that oil deal. 

End of story.  Period!

3064 2018-07-05 19:15:15 In Europe is what not a single one. It was the cumulative effect of disrupting German transportation and oil whiched forced the Luftwaffe into a defense of the homeland....where in Spring 1944 the USAAF and RAF ripped the guts out of it.  This gave the Western Allies supremacy.
3065 2018-07-05 19:15:09 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Scott Pruitt allowed oil drilling in a beautiful infant.

3069 2018-07-05 19:14:34 Just incredible, business 101! Fire the CEO , simply because politics and business are like oil & water.
3070 2018-07-05 19:14:19 Our world is still using coal & oil, like it or not. These jobs didn’t disappear they moved to China. Has anyone seen the condition of their cities? At least we have regulations - love Americans attitude,  not in my backyard. - I didn’t read the piece.
3071 2018-07-05 19:14:14 Yeah well they aren't making new oil or coal. So hang around. It is finite but wind, solar and wave are infinite and  clean so its bizarre that you are happy to support the oil industry and... baffling. Kind of 'self schadenfreude'.
3072 2018-07-05 19:14:08 Well there’s like one norwegian band people know about and that’s a-ha, we’re not really known for our music (or anything really except maybe oil)
3073 2018-07-05 19:14:07 Know what pisses me off? Reading a thread about migraines and bitches pimping their essential oil MLM bullshit as the CURE. wouldn't it be nice if everything was that fucking easy?
3074 2018-07-05 19:14:05 Wow I thought coconut oil was the one ingredient no one could have an adverse reaction to!
3075 2018-07-05 19:14:04 Put my recycling out and the council refused to take an EMPTY oil bottle mind blown! @NorthSomersetC
3076 2018-07-05 19:14:04 I heard good things about the keto diet as well as Georgina said. Im herxing at the moment from starting essential oil combos and black seed oil(I swear by this stuff!) and its hitting in waves. So I have been trying to up my antioxidant intake and it seems to help.

3079 2018-07-05 19:13:41 Lolol how do you cross the line at oreos. We switch from cow milk to coconut milk etc. We switch our meata to fake meats but god forbid we gotta buy oreos without Palm oil god Damn. Crossed the line
3080 2018-07-05 19:13:37 I’m at Walmart waiting on an oil change. Time for some people watching. #atWalmart
3081 2018-07-05 19:13:35 Oil has been this high before and the world didn't collapse. Also we don't burn oil to generate electricity, and most people exchanged their oil for natural gas (which has a different commodity market from oil).
Just a bit of healthy inflation is all.
3082 2018-07-05 19:13:29 Which is why they quickly switched conversion to oil...
3083 2018-07-05 19:13:19 So,  to a tasty summer: mango jalapeño dressing
- 1 pitted peeled mango
- zest and juice from 1 lime
- additional 2-4 Tblspoons lime juice 
- 1 jalapeño (use seeds 4 extra spice)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon fish oil (or use vinegar if vegan)
3084 2018-07-05 19:13:19 Thanks so much for taking the time to try our 7 Wonders Oil and for your wonderful words and support. So glad you love it! 
3085 2018-07-05 19:13:05 I was going to nap. But then the oil delivery man came and the dogs lost their shit.
3086 2018-07-05 19:13:01 He soaked his bars in Oil of Olay and Dove body wash for 3 months before recording
3087 2018-07-05 19:12:54 What if we had oil (an abundance of oil) that’s how Petrojam would waste the money? You could just add people name on Payroll. We must do better. We must demand better from people in authority.
3088 2018-07-05 19:12:45 love bringing my car for only an oil change and then having to pay $700 more bc i need all 4 tires replaced & my a/c wasn’t working properly. heck yeah #broke

3104 2018-07-05 19:11:03 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
3105 2018-07-05 19:10:57 I'm only arguing that the RECENT price increases are due to the drop in the CAD and oil price rise. Also, when oil was 120 a barrel, the CAD was at or near par, which accounts for about 37 cents a litre. Add in over 50 cents/litre in taxes and it helps explain current prices.
3106 2018-07-05 19:10:54 That will take years to build!! In the mean time you pricks sold off the strategic oil reserves for a song and a kickback to pay for 2016 election @MYANC @CyrilRamaphosa @zizikodwa @JacksonMthembu_ @GwedeMantashe1 @MbalulaFikile @mgigaba

3113 2018-07-05 19:09:44 Just do a VPP ... the mother of all VPPs.  KSA gets cash up front. Buyers get oil at long term agreed upon price.
3114 2018-07-05 19:09:41 The Democrats vowed in a public statement to play dirty. This a snake oil move but it's slippery & we will "Trump" them.
3115 2018-07-05 19:09:08 Welcome to my home area... born in Hagerstown work near Lincoln.  Great couple of weeks!! Miss you in trucks though
3116 2018-07-05 19:08:51 stop exporting our oil and gas maybe?
3117 2018-07-05 19:08:42 It is murder. An animal is being killed to get the product? Can you confirm that an orangutan is killed when you buy palm oil? It's a ridiculous comparison. Vegans do what they can to stop the exploitation of animals, yes palm oil is bad but certainly better than meat or dairy.
3118 2018-07-05 19:08:42 Or the United States could invest in energy sources (such as solar) that reduce oil dependence and as a bonus reduces climate change.
3119 2018-07-05 19:08:11 the project I *want* to do is a squad-based sc-fi RTT, where you board abandoned mega-vehicles and try to strip them of parts

3121 2018-07-05 19:08:05 I hope you find him. The shelters will be full of runaways today. I gave my Yorkie some CBD oil last night and she was calm for the first time. Hope this helps your dog in the future.

3125 2018-07-05 19:07:36 "Fossil Fuels" is a dim-witted term which improperly, even unconscionably, categorizes the climate debate. Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas are all VERY different fuels. To lump natural gas and coal together, and compare them to another fuel, is shear stupidity. #climatechange
3126 2018-07-05 19:07:19 No disagreement on downsizing. I disagree with a bloated budget increasing the debt by 1.3 trillion dollars. I disagree with the Feds taking $ from social security to the point it will be insolvent.  I disagree with 4.6 billion in subsidies for oil companies , I could go on...
3127 2018-07-05 19:07:05 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q

vs his veiled smirk at 2:45 - 2:53 is awesomeness. 
I realize at that point he's talking about oil but it seems he'd making a connection.
3130 2018-07-05 19:06:26 It’s my understanding that its small and is controlled waste @ the same time am all for oil and gas! Wind and solar to me is not a solution to long term power.
3131 2018-07-05 19:06:09 Erik Prince (Emerdata) and CambridgeAnalytica (Mercers in the same hate group "Council for National Policy" with his longtime pal Lyin' #Pence) are killers for oil profits hijacking our American #democracy & #climateaction!  
Don't let criminals off the hook: Schmitz Rohrabacher!
3132 2018-07-05 19:06:05 Not if they are not selling their oil and can't get paid for the oil they sell. This is regime's Propaganda, oil prices can't get that high because that level of demand isn't there and pressure on supplies would be the result of cutting Iran from the markets
3133 2018-07-05 19:06:02 dan ya , baby oil gatau dimana.
3134 2018-07-05 19:05:58 @GovCanHealth did u know eating 60 caps of weed oil eaten within 2 months cures 90 percent of cancers

3139 2018-07-05 19:05:36 See the fin 24 article it is quite comprehensive if you Google the sale of strategic oil reserves, the missing 1,5 billion is a mystery although Tina jouma Pietersen was in charge and has since faded away, typical government corruption case with zero consequences

3141 2018-07-05 19:05:16 I didn't encourage anyone to invest and eat them, I said that they're vegan. Which, as it happens, they are. Unfortunately, the majority of vegan alternatives contain palm oil, at least in my country. Stuff like this is what makes veganism seem impossible.
3142 2018-07-05 19:05:14 Ok watching from that point!  Looking from the point of investor is psychologically exhausting has never replicated the price of OIL!  Look #MRO .. # ECA .. # PBR..ect..ect ..
3143 2018-07-05 19:05:03 My dumbass put drops of self-tanning oil on my hand from this product at Sephora thinking it wasn’t going to work but now who’s the stupid one with a blotchy, weird-looking tan on her hand and fingers??

3146 2018-07-05 19:04:54 Just before flowering...spray the lemon tree with white oil and give it iron fertilizer, then water 
3147 2018-07-05 19:04:53 45* tweets, the world listens & words have consequences. In 280 characters, 45* starts trade wars & they aren't easy to win; he's going to learn that the hard way. OPEC isn't worried about 45* either. Why negotiate with someone who *needs* the oil but lies and backs out of deals?
3148 2018-07-05 19:04:51 I watched Lorenzo's Oil in a high school biology class and a kid got himself sent to the counselor because he said, out loud, "I'm going to kill myself if Nick Nolte says saturated fats one more time."

3152 2018-07-05 19:04:40 @POTUS If you want oil price to go down, why not support @Tesla to built more EV Supercharging stations/ solar energy products? Increase and extend federal credit to US built EV cars should help defeat higher oil price. No credit for foreign built. #SupportTesla $TSLA @elonmusk
3153 2018-07-05 19:04:33 This is bogus and makes you look unprofessional as fck. Theres people in this country that would do anything for real CBD oil that helps some Cancers and this is not it!!! @EddieHearn @SkySportsBoxing have a fkin word would you!
3154 2018-07-05 19:04:32 Who knows how healthy red/palm oil is please? 
3155 2018-07-05 19:04:26 And a great way to eat them, cut into approx 50mm chunks, hollow out one end with a melon-baller, stuff with bel paese cheese, top with a slice of baby tomato, put in baking tray, drizzle olive oil, season and sprinkle grated parmesan on top. Bake 10-15mins.

3167 2018-07-05 19:03:03 BTW I hate El Segundo! They sold our beach to Standard oil. Or Standard Oil made El Segundo. Spanish for “the second” (wrong pronoun). The second oil refinery on the west coast. (I heard from many people)

3175 2018-07-05 19:01:39 Pure sugar is 1700 cals per lb (4000 per kg). Pure oil, butter, margarine, lard, salad dressing etc are 4000 cals per lb (9000 per kg). Which is concentrated calories?
3176 2018-07-05 19:01:36 Actually the US is the largest producer of oil in the world not withstanding other sources need to be developed.
3177 2018-07-05 19:01:34 I get that you're making a rhetorical point, but people have said that for years (remember "peak oil"?) and last I checked the world still mostly runs on carbon. China is building coal plants, electric cars on the road are very rare.
3178 2018-07-05 19:01:30 $90 for a oil change 
3179 2018-07-05 19:01:27 #AGolfTwittler will make someone pay, perhaps nuke Venezuela or something, he's been after their oil for years anyway. That's how he rolls. His skin is now so thin you can see Russia through it.
3180 2018-07-05 19:01:17 Oil and gas exploration has no risk whatsoever  Good for you for making money but sometimes it’s better to admit your lucky rather than good. This is a ponzu stock for the boys in the know. Majority of PI will get slaughtered lots already.

3198 2018-07-05 18:59:44 Then WHY is he demanding OPEC to pump more oil. That doesn’t make sense coming from either of you
3199 2018-07-05 18:59:31 Korean honey bbq sauce is like... what, honey mixed with sesame oil? My brain can't process that
3200 2018-07-05 18:59:26 Mike Hudema's actions will also put more lives at risk. More oil in rail cars means more interactions with people during transport. It also means more oil moving by truck on the highways which further increases risk of fatal accidents.
3201 2018-07-05 18:59:15 I avoid plant oils.  They have bioactive compounds, as you would expect from olive oil, given the bitter taste.  I use lard / bacon drippings, tallow, and sometimes butter, if I want more fat.

3205 2018-07-05 18:58:30 There is no such thing as energy independence. Not long term. And, really, not even in the short term. Even if we were able to discover enough deposits of oil domestically, we the people wouldn't be energy independent from the corporations or politicians who control it.
3206 2018-07-05 18:58:25 YES! I understand #DemExit but #walkaway is like taking refuge from a burning forest fire by JUMPING INTO A VAT OF HOT OIL!
3207 2018-07-05 18:58:20 It rubs the oil on the skin.
3208 2018-07-05 18:58:08 It’s pretty straitforward PR strategy. Culture Unstained have done loads of research on this - worth reading their site - and would probably add the oil companies do it to control narratives and to use high status places to do lobbying in. Mel Evans’ book, Artwash is also good.
3209 2018-07-05 18:58:06 I thought my tanning oil had spf 
3210 2018-07-05 18:58:02 However, if #Iran cannot sell its oil under US pressure, then Gulf States especially Saudi Arabia must drink (but not sell) the oil.
3211 2018-07-05 18:57:52 It seems to me it’s another #DonTheCin scam. Notice @realDonaldTrump starts a fight with OPEC over oil prices. When he goes to Russia he will “make a brilliant” deal to buy oil from Putin.  Somehow all this will flow through a Trump company.  Any bets?  #PutinsPuppet #TrumpRussia
3212 2018-07-05 18:57:48 Because the gov has no long term vision, the biofuel idea was dumped when oil dropped to $40/barrel, had they stuck to their guns we would have biofuel inclusion rates of up to 5%

3217 2018-07-05 18:57:22 Dear PM @JustinTrudeau I am a huge fan and supporter..awesome job

I have a question

Oil in 2006 $75  and gasoline = 95 cents/ltr , yet in 2018 oil =$ 70 / barrel and gasoline = $1,30/ ltr , oil companies  are gouging us

Can you please deter this attack on Canadian pocketbooks
3218 2018-07-05 18:57:12 Wow. I watched it! So breathtakingly beautiful! Palm oil plantations exported for products here that we consume! It’s not something far way it’s something we are causing right here right now. Please check if there is palm oil in the products we use. 
3219 2018-07-05 18:56:57 Pardon the inconvenience, can we get free oil, please?
3220 2018-07-05 18:56:45 I will hold $DRYS long but I have to short oil each time as a hedge.  Need a balanced approach.

3222 2018-07-05 18:56:41 Yes but pure coconut oil is versatile so she thought it could be asked for skin also 
3223 2018-07-05 18:56:40 STOP SELLING OUR NATIONAL OIL RESERVES!!!!
3224 2018-07-05 18:56:36 So go after the oil companies. They are the culprits.
3225 2018-07-05 18:56:29 BP acquired its rights through acquiring Standard Oil of Ohio
3226 2018-07-05 18:56:24 I got the same oil under me scrotum
3227 2018-07-05 18:56:21 i really don’t wanna drive to yellowstone for an oil change but it’s free so let me not complain
3228 2018-07-05 18:56:00 Putin will really appreciate it, he is desperate for higher oil price.
3229 2018-07-05 18:55:49 Also the decline of oil price and push for alternative fuels esp., EV revolution helping in this, we should discourage unskilled Hindus going to Gulf countries they are subjected to many atrocities
3230 2018-07-05 18:55:43 Donald helping oil companies rig gas prices. Looking out for the middle class. Making Americans Pay Again?
3231 2018-07-05 18:55:36 What the actual fuck am I reading right now? It’s like 2 different conversations. In order to make plastics and other synthetic materials, we have to start with the products created through oil refining.  We need to find advanced ways to recycle plastics so we can use less raw
3232 2018-07-05 18:55:30 WD40 or some kind of oil? I wonder if cooling down the key in case the heat has made it expand would help?
3233 2018-07-05 18:55:20 Trump wants to seize oil. Canada should worry 
3234 2018-07-05 18:55:18 Corexit (often styled COREXIT) is a product line of oil dispersants used during oil spill ...                                   Corexit was originally developed by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.
3235 2018-07-05 18:55:08 oil? so that's why it's been so strong...
3236 2018-07-05 18:54:57 How do you grow and produce the plant protein without oil?
3237 2018-07-05 18:54:57 No proof that oil prices are moving on trump tweets.   Growth in commodity index trading coincided with a boom in commodity prices, speculation by financial traders—and not supply and demand on Iran or Trump Tweets.
3238 2018-07-05 18:54:56 Hey @CNBC - 1. Trump is not 'ordering' but requesting an increase in production. 2. He's aware that taking Iranian oil off the mkt is causing spike in prices, duh. 3. Somebody tell Helima that the bigger goal is to improve the situation for the people of Iran. @CNBC=partisan spin
3239 2018-07-05 18:54:52 5 of them are oil producing countries
3240 2018-07-05 18:54:42 haha, same, damn that argan oil! damn my luscious soft locks! neon is definitely right. tis stunning.
3241 2018-07-05 18:54:26 Have an Ioniq, other than brake/radiator fluid and pollen filter, what is there to do? Did hear a nasty rumour that the oil needs changing in the reduction box.
3242 2018-07-05 18:54:23 $CL_F #Trump wonders why #OIL price is up? 1) US Exports 2) Tillerson Deal with Saudis 3) IRAN BS $) Venezuela BS and SouthWestern US votes
3243 2018-07-05 18:54:18 Gotta hedge, be in oil just like multinational, ‘upstream and downstream’.
3244 2018-07-05 18:54:11 Well my oil change is done thank god
3245 2018-07-05 18:54:06 Weigh out one ounces of olive oil and put back on heat.

3248 2018-07-05 18:53:51 Who controls the price of oil?
3249 2018-07-05 18:53:36 Numbers, facts, projections based on setting up a totally independent economy. I want to see these data, not just take it off of a wink & a nudge. 
And have u seen the state of the N sea oil industry right now? I’m living surrounded by the fallout from the mess.
3250 2018-07-05 18:53:35 Buong akala ko sa mga sasakyan lang yung change oil, aba pati na rin pala tao nag cha-change oil hahaha 
3251 2018-07-05 18:53:34 did yall catch that invitation from Ghana saying Sasol must come through... maybe CR17 struck a deal to bring some of that oil home in exchange for something-something
3252 2018-07-05 18:53:31 Must check Hispanic markets near here for your brand of beef tallow. I’m getting bored using coconut oil as my default saturated fat, even the variety with most of the flavor removed.

3254 2018-07-05 18:53:27 You good momma? If not my actual momma sells hemp oil which helped with my shoulder pain.
3255 2018-07-05 18:53:20 Someone needs to tell me to stop watching An Extremely Goofy Movie and to go get my oil changed already.
3256 2018-07-05 18:53:17 Never mentioned oil in my tweet so are you using that as an excuse? all I’m saying speak the facts and the truth about our economic and social issues
3257 2018-07-05 18:53:12 That water looks like the oil your grandma fried chicken with. Yuck.

3258 2018-07-05 18:53:04 Attempting to make tuna salad. Well just noodles and tuna. But why is there oil in the can?! Nasty
3259 2018-07-05 18:53:00  (this is holy oil)
3260 2018-07-05 18:52:59 The Standard Oil Company conspired to restrain the trade and commerce in petroleum, and to monopolize the commerce in petroleum, in violation of the Sherman Act, and was split into many smaller companies. Several individuals, including John D. Rockefeller, were fined.
3261 2018-07-05 18:52:57 The one Who kill v8s in The oil crisis!!!

3264 2018-07-05 18:52:27 Hey Chuck do you ever mix oil sticks with colored pencils?
3265 2018-07-05 18:52:25 0 from ROSE ODER STERN
Kenneth Bird
Oil on color
3266 2018-07-05 18:52:23 No, fair enough, it was joedee4life, the guy I was talking to when you jumped in. I was wrong, I got you mixed up with a similar nat-know-nowt (though not as wrong as not knowing we get all "oor oil" money back right enough )
3267 2018-07-05 18:52:22 その前に痴呆の検査を年一で受けるように言って実行して貰うといいですよ。
3268 2018-07-05 18:52:18 5 July - The MAGAts are their own worst enemy. Without benefit of basic medical knowledge and refusing to heed the advice of our veteran immigrant docs, they weaken swiftly, opting for Alex Jones’ essential oil tinctures and ‘christian’ MLMs. #SecondCivilWarLetters
3269 2018-07-05 18:52:17 "They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:" ~Matthew 25:3 #Jesus #God #Bible
3270 2018-07-05 18:52:11 Covered my self in oil before I am still the same colour. Albino bitch
3271 2018-07-05 18:52:10 They need those beans. Cooking oil and livestock feed. I agree with you
3272 2018-07-05 18:51:58 Don't act like you don't have the swamp booty
3273 2018-07-05 18:51:50 Farty the boob oil salesman. STEP RIGHT UP AND SEE THE WONDERS OF @ScarlettLacyMFC BOBS! They cure all of your ill wills! They'll make you see further, shoot faster, jump higher!
3274 2018-07-05 18:51:27 Don’t worry we just pissed away a billion dollars for an oil pipeline. That will help right ?
3275 2018-07-05 18:51:22 "But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps." ~Matthew 25:4 #Jesus #God #Bible
3276 2018-07-05 18:51:19 Or at least child endangerment
3277 2018-07-05 18:51:18 I spray my Bambino's daily  with a homemade spray of oil and water.
3278 2018-07-05 18:51:17 The oil companies love it there making tons of money Trump keep giving them billionaires more and more money and a small people keep paying so tired of winning Trump's going to screw us every time he can and take care of his buddies make America poor again
3279 2018-07-05 18:51:15 I should have told you Son. Gas is expensive. Insurance is pricey too. Tires, oil changes, repairs...yup, it’s expensive to be independent. But you’ll enjoy the freedom.
3280 2018-07-05 18:50:38 How long they last drones how you take care of them if you have a lot of oil free products it will help. Skincare and makeup products
3281 2018-07-05 18:50:24 Yup, not just Trump. 2014 key unelected Republicans, Giuliani, RonPaul, FGraham, Buchanan publicly endorsed Putin>Obama. Republican Party of oil hooked up w Russia, country of oil right in Comey’s face. What happened in 2013 giving them the nerve to go public b4 2014 election?
3282 2018-07-05 18:50:23 Perhaps you should have time to study books about the fuel industry. The economics part of it. Learn about the crude oil. the prices that fluctuate. then you will have an informed opinion.
3283 2018-07-05 18:50:20 When I see BP, I think British Petroleum; that oil company responsible for the worst oil spill in recent history. It also happens to be the acronym of a girl group whose fans argue they’re “revolutionary”, yet those girls’ images, behavior, and lyrics perpetuate heteronormative+
3284 2018-07-05 18:50:06 ひいお祖母ちゃんが二人共90歳と100歳越えてから亡くなったから多分女性は全員長生きしそう………
3285 2018-07-05 18:50:04 You could just rerun any of his snake oil selling speeches from the last 2 years & nobody would notice the difference.
3286 2018-07-05 18:50:02 Smoking weed oil in front of the cops
3287 2018-07-05 18:49:55 Ok. I think I deserve 5 minutes with my feet up. 

Played outside with C for an hour, cleaned her up and changed her clothes, got her a snack, put the ribs on to boil and washed the mushrooms and put them in oil, garlic and spices to marinate.
3288 2018-07-05 18:49:51 Nothing like Hitler having Germany invade Poland...  Use the pretext of the political climate...  oh, and Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.  Now switch to the possible comparisons of imperial WW2 Japan...
3289 2018-07-05 18:49:46 Drunk Elephant DBronzi is CRACKKKKKKK OMG

Holy shit
Tried with Bhydra light and perfect and Marula oil soaks right in and gives a better glow

Im in love
3290 2018-07-05 18:49:44 If it wasn't for opec trading oil in dollars the US dollar would be a busted flush. Go on, push them, you think this tit for tat tarrif nonsense makes a big man? Wait until opec start trading in yen. That's the end of the US economy. You're a failed businessman not a statesman.
3291 2018-07-05 18:49:42 i gotta oil my scalp today, walking around looking DUSTY
3292 2018-07-05 18:49:37 Clippers, cocoa butter face, baby oil gel body....smell good ..... and b-ball shorts/jogging pants and tank top
3293 2018-07-05 18:49:28 Her first thought was not that it was stolen?
3294 2018-07-05 18:49:20 Honda take so damn long to change your oil 
3295 2018-07-05 18:49:18 2/ Nigerians that are currently unbanked can still do business in the country because of the preponderance of ready alternatives. Therefore, the current behaviour in the banks are unlikely to affect consumers as much as anticompetitive behaviour in the oil and gas industry
3296 2018-07-05 18:49:17 Rising oil prices helps the Russian economy.
3297 2018-07-05 18:49:08 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
3298 2018-07-05 18:48:59 ...especially when we see that it claims to be spending hundreds of billions on weapons purchases. I suspect they are running out of oil far faster than they let on, and the problem with floatation is that this fact would be exposed.
3299 2018-07-05 18:48:58 PFI ATOS & did nothing to end plight of homeless vets with PTSD!!! Plus illegal war! If he'd waited for UN approval none of us would be debating it! Now Iraq in state of anarchy! Remember it was all about protecting oil! Never about Saddam or we'd be in Yemen now!!!
3300 2018-07-05 18:48:48 It’s hypocritical of you to talk about this now after @POTUS44 built more oil pipelines than any other president in history & exported fracking to every country, regardless the Paris agreement... Corporate Dems are just like GOP! #GOGreenParty #GreenNewDeal
3301 2018-07-05 18:48:41 This analogy is confusing for me because I’m using the “new oil” to produce the old oil. We often use the new oil to improve performance of simulation, the “new data”, to increase production of the old oil...
3302 2018-07-05 18:48:31 Let's face it @realDonaldTrump is so fucking stupid, next thing you know, he'll impose tariffs on oil imports.
3303 2018-07-05 18:48:27 you know I'm glad yall tweeted me....5hrs for an oil change. I don't care if its free, ain never waiting 5hrs. Lol I'm good luv.
3304 2018-07-05 18:48:17 Would've probably run smoother, ya know all the tanning oil.
3305 2018-07-05 18:48:12 My dad Kuma! Sai dai Dangote/Otedola
3306 2018-07-05 18:48:11 I'm single. Not that productive but happily marching on with my studies.
3307 2018-07-05 18:48:11 I paid $96 for an oil change this morning.. with a coupon. I’m still so confused. Like. What do I even drive? Where do they find that oil? I wanted to dispute that so bad y’all just don’t know. 
3308 2018-07-05 18:48:08 Oil to put ony sexy body?
3309 2018-07-05 18:48:07 Oh no! You mean my taxes will go to provide adequate schooling and healthcare instead of oil subsidies? What about bloating private military contracts? Will the socialists take those away from me too?
3310 2018-07-05 18:48:07 People pray for cake...but when the almighty gives them eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan & an oven they get frustrated & leave the kitchen.
3311 2018-07-05 18:48:04 This is the worst form of ignorance. You think fuel prices are increasing because Ramaphosa wants to benefit? Whats's the rand rate again? what the oil price per barrel again?
3312 2018-07-05 18:48:03 It's constant. Business Insider, Bloomberg, Reuters. I'm an idiot with no money,so I have very little reason to see these articles, but I see them all the time! It is a full on attack.The oil industry hates EVs.UAW hates Elon.I'm convinced the aluminum tariff is aimed at @Tesla
3313 2018-07-05 18:47:52 "And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out." ~Matthew 25:8 #Jesus #God #Bible
3314 2018-07-05 18:47:47 A short thread about Scotland

All oil revenues earned from the North Sea are fully attributed to Scotland

All taxes paid in Scotland are fully attributed to Scotland

Our earning don’t cover our expenses. We spent £13.257bn last year more than we earned
3315 2018-07-05 18:47:47 I knew this would happen
3316 2018-07-05 18:47:35 Trump cause this problem in two ways first he said the world quit buying a Iranian oil or he would punish the countries  in January he gave a big gift to the oil companies that they could export oil which they were not allow to do us oil was to stay here he's an idiot
3317 2018-07-05 18:47:34 I miss going to get oil changes with my dad.  It’s the little things that you miss.

And yes, I’m currently sitting at JiffyLube trying not to cry while I wait for my car to be done.
3318 2018-07-05 18:47:32 That's a lot of oil!
3319 2018-07-05 18:47:26 You forgot oil...
3320 2018-07-05 18:47:24 So  changing oil on big rigs @EvangelineLilly #TheAntMovie I felt the same way "Why viewed as just a man's job" we women can do whatever we put our hard working minds can dream of. My fam n frnz are yet amazed that I drive rigs and I'm the shortest. #EverybodyTalks @TheTalkCBS
3321 2018-07-05 18:47:22 The traitorous senators all have oil pipelines going thru their states. They are priming the putin pump, as RU will be usa’s only trade partner due to djt’s tarriffs & destruction of trade agreements. Great yet?
3322 2018-07-05 18:47:21 One defeated oil trader lamented at that time that “The oil reserves were sold for a purpose we don’t understand, at a price we don’t understand and at a price that no professional oil market participant would understand.“ 
3323 2018-07-05 18:47:17 Native Americans in Alaska, Dakotas, and Montana sit in the greatest oil and gas reserves for the U.S.  All they ask for clean exploitation & that NA be employed in these fields.  We don't have to be dependent on Arab oil that is a hoax created by the deep state to start conflict
3324 2018-07-05 18:47:09 Oil yes, then it depends how deep down the rabbit hole you are willing to go.
3325 2018-07-05 18:47:06 Dear Saudi— “get the oil price down or we fuck the Aramco IPO”

3327 2018-07-05 18:46:52 my landlord brought a family in to show them our apartment and i had just cooked food so the apartment still had that smell and the entire family goes “it smells SOOOO good in here omg” i literally only used olive oil, salt, pepper, and curry powder, karen.
3328 2018-07-05 18:46:30 In Canada gas prices are influenced by oil prices plus also by federal, provincial, local excise taxes, GST, carbon taxes etc. Many of these taxes are taxes on top of taxes. So the real winners are the governments who need a revenue source because they have scared business away!
3329 2018-07-05 18:46:26 If you’re for open borders then you should be in favor of the full annexation of Mexico, census and identification of citizenry, and a thorough dismantling of the cartels that run it (paid for by the oil we’d seize during the process.) Or we could just secure the border.
3330 2018-07-05 18:46:19 I wouldn't be surprised if oil companies are paying the media to talk shit about @Tesla, it would make sense considering @Tesla's massive success.
3331 2018-07-05 18:46:16 Tea tree oil!!
3332 2018-07-05 18:46:04 The problem with the story is that a healthy Saudi economy with solid oil and gas reserves would never be in need of floating its greatest national asset on international markets for the sake of raising €100 bn in foreign investments into its economy. It just doesn't add up...
3333 2018-07-05 18:46:03 be awash with data / bumper harvest / drizzle olive oil / vintner /
3334 2018-07-05 18:46:00 What is it with the Brits and Palm oil? Nearly every food that we have brought so far in the UK has Palm oil added... Why? #palmoil #UK #WTF
3335 2018-07-05 18:45:59 The us got the money from the vast amounts of resources at its disposal. You know, things like oil and gold as well as all of our other natural resources.
3336 2018-07-05 18:45:51 @ NicolasMaduro  He just wants your oil that's all because Trump is a prick.
3337 2018-07-05 18:45:50 I need to not be having thoughts about a new Jeep every time I get an oil change...
3338 2018-07-05 18:45:46 Combine 9 oz dairy with 9 oz goose. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Boil. Serve for brunch
3339 2018-07-05 18:45:36 Cauliflower rice, cauliflower couscous, grain-free tabbuleh. It's a very versatile vegetable. Especially for those of us with a coeliac gut. Many simple home made dressing can be made from olive or avocado oil, orange or lemon juice and garlic and herbs.
3340 2018-07-05 18:45:35 And never run out of anointing oil 
3341 2018-07-05 18:45:32 this is probably an unrelatable tweet just realized that my pickled fresnos and olive oil cured anchovies got thrown out :/ RIP my spicy and fishy boys
3342 2018-07-05 18:45:24 Why aren't you hearing our cries, pleas, and fears? Why are you doing this to us? We don't want to pay for a pipeline! Stop hindering our future and have the balls to change things, @JustinTrudeau - making the tax payer pay for it is so disrespectful. Fuck oil. It's old hat! 
3343 2018-07-05 18:45:11 And still Rick Scott is the best choice for Florida. He has been a great Governor, especially thru Irma.. when we sat in darkness we saw all the oil tankers coming in with gas.. He handled the storm aftermath like a pro. I remember thinking "Thank God Rick Scott is our Governor
3344 2018-07-05 18:45:09 Donald Trump’s Bizarro World: The US produces 75% of its oil requirements. He should just ask US producers to reduce their price for oil. He did just give them a big tax reduction!
3345 2018-07-05 18:45:05 I prefer my employees in oil tbh
3346 2018-07-05 18:45:03 Good, you said before oil. Nigeria is not ready for state policing.
3347 2018-07-05 18:44:50 Tfw you need that oil and Hezbollah blew up one Marine barracks.
3348 2018-07-05 18:44:34 Don't see why it should affect the rest of us. Just don't sell the oil to America if Trump has such a problem.
3349 2018-07-05 18:44:12 I’ve been lathering up my hooks up in coconut oil. My hooks need to shine like my outer beauty. Leviathan noticed and complimented me. #Keto #TeamTaken
3350 2018-07-05 18:44:10 Just BOUGHT 1 @ 72.96 Crude Oil Aug18 closing shorts ▷$CL_F from my @iBroker iPhone App
3351 2018-07-05 18:44:09 1/ Thanks for your questions Kalu. I think the nature/ structure of the oil and gas industry is quite different from that of banking
3352 2018-07-05 18:44:08 If his Dad is oil money
3353 2018-07-05 18:43:59 I hate getting my oil changed like idk anything your asking me all I can tell you is your gonna have to put the seat back cause you’re taller then me and you might find road snacks cause I get hungry when I drive 
3354 2018-07-05 18:43:57 True but the people you're addressing keep changing language. Created to communicate thoughts, ideas precisely and eliminate confusion it becomes more confusing daily.
3355 2018-07-05 18:43:57 Analysis: War on Drugs. The prison population is about to change. Medical doctors to replace street drug dealers in prison as law enforcement starts to bust opioid prescribing doctors. In jail, doctors will be able to enjoy the health diet they recommend: corn oil and margarine.
3356 2018-07-05 18:43:55 @Flora can you confirm that #dairyfree version contains sustainable palm oil? Stating your commitment to sustainably sourcing it isn’t the answer I’m looking for btw
3357 2018-07-05 18:43:42 Excellent! Pinheads w/ no education  in the ecology or oil & gas business! The Canadian oil patch is the safest and most heavily regulated one in the world. Anybody who does 1 DAY of actual research will get this.
Greenpeacers get a real life and a job and grow up!
3358 2018-07-05 18:43:39 Jokes on you. I used my arms to make vape oil
3359 2018-07-05 18:43:34 I've been at the dealership for 2 hours and all I needed was an oil change and a tire rotation. I'm confused
3360 2018-07-05 18:43:34 Another working poor horror story. DODGE CALIBER HAD A RECALL ON BOTH FRONT AND BACK CROSS MEMBER RUSTING OUT! FACTORY AND DEALER NEVER TOLD CUSTOMER OF RECALL.EVEN THOUGH CAR WAS GETTING OIL CHANGES. AT DEALER.
RECALL NOT HONORED!
3361 2018-07-05 18:43:26 Guess who just got burned by oil 
3362 2018-07-05 18:43:21 The President is transparent and thinking  like a business man. He’s not trying to hold oil hostage and I am sure the other countries are fearful of feeling like they are being publicly pitted against each other. That’s how business works sometimes????
3363 2018-07-05 18:43:17 勉強になります！私の親はまだ先になりそうですが、早めに親とそうなった場合の事を決めておこうかと思います。
3364 2018-07-05 18:43:14 I had a salesman bothering me at the dealership once. I kept trying to be nice. I finally had to tell him "I came here for an oil change and not to buy a new car." But I did it in the sweetest way.
3365 2018-07-05 18:43:08 A whole 10.3million barrels of our strategic oil reserves was sold off to the lowest bidder by then Energy Minister, Tina Joemat-Pettersson, & her daring gang in Dec 2015 & Jan 2016 (at a price of $28 a barrel instead of $36 market price at that time).
3366 2018-07-05 18:43:01 Lol, that from the guy who didn't even k ow we get ALL 'oor oil' money back 
3367 2018-07-05 18:42:53 My community’s Facebook page truly kills me when everyone is upset about fireworks  I’m sorry, you know they are coming, take some melatonin, give your pets some Benadryl or CBD oil as prescribed by a vet and chill out pls
3368 2018-07-05 18:42:49 He can tell his dad to buy one for me,since today is my birthday, its gonna b a nice bday present
3369 2018-07-05 18:42:47 Mr. President start the oil pumps in Alaska, Montana, and Dakotas, we have 100-year reserves in OIL in these places, we won't be using oil in 100 years. Kiss the Arabs good-bye now!  You yourself talk about making it in America for America, so let's make it in America now!!!!!!
3370 2018-07-05 18:42:33 Simply take Essar steel and Essar oil case. Essar steel has NPA worth 37 or 40k crores. Essar oil was sold to Rosneft for 88k crores. The deal was brokered by Modi. Why can't they pay off the loans? They both belongs to Ruias.
3371 2018-07-05 18:42:32 I think it may be more about oil and gas deals ... which is still reprehensible to be doing on the sly with a country that is supposed to be under punitive sanctions to deter them from interfering with our elections!
3372 2018-07-05 18:42:29 And free education to degree level, well-paid work with rights, the NHS not in crisis, some of the world’s worst diseases conquered, no mental health crisis, loads of pubs with cheap beer, the steel industry, the oil industry, street parties, loads of social housing ...
3373 2018-07-05 18:42:26 Engine started shaking and wouldn’t get up to speed on the way to get my oil changed and I have no money to spare!! I hate my fuckin life so much I hope it’s nothing
3374 2018-07-05 18:42:25 And democrats and truth, like oil and water
3375 2018-07-05 18:42:06 Nah can you change my oil tho
3376 2018-07-05 18:42:04 @rcarlmark You must have a part-time job as an editor at CNN they went on for some time about oil prices
3377 2018-07-05 18:41:20 Absolutely, that’s why that republican delegation went there first to have his back when he lifts them!  It’s all about OIL , I’m positive!
3378 2018-07-05 18:41:20 Now playing: 'BEDS ARE BURNING' by 'MIDNIGHT OIL'
3379 2018-07-05 18:41:16 Get Jk Rowling to do a stunt...Waiting on Cataclysmic to come  to the fold ..And the oil is turning into tablet..only useable if there is a shortage of Moses and his 10 commandments.
3380 2018-07-05 18:41:12 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
3381 2018-07-05 18:41:12 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

3386 2018-07-05 18:40:57 Make sales tax 20 cents and go electric with an all Canadian car. Canadians are taken as stupid suckers building earth heating dinosaurs to keep the oil investors in the USA sitting on their gold toilets.

3390 2018-07-05 18:40:45 When in open spaces, please follow the rules:
- if biking, go as fast as you can
- talk as loudly as possible
- if that doesn't scare the wildlife, throw rocks
- or a few rounds from your AR-15 should do the trick
- fuck it, go ahead and drill for oil
- have fun!
3391 2018-07-05 18:40:32 Cover then in olive oil. It will. Stop them smudging

3393 2018-07-05 18:40:17 It has its applications, as @ascarbs rightly notes. However, I doubt it should be a staple in a regular KD except perhaps as a cooking oil. As basic low-carb nutrition goes, I view it as a lever; helpful for entering ketosis, but with diminishing usefulness thereafter.

3398 2018-07-05 18:40:06 It's unfair to tax thrice one particular commodity but why can't Caesar go and sell crude oil
3399 2018-07-05 18:39:52 1 Wabush is remote from everything. That’s really just reductio ad absurdum again.
2 By your logic, we should have just relented on offshore oil management because it’s entirely federal jurisdiction. PET would have looked after us.
3400 2018-07-05 18:39:44 You know where I’m coming from, but I doubt the purpose of you flying is restricted to “socializing”. I suspect that part of your motivation to fly is your subconscious desire to prop up big oil that you fear losing.
3401 2018-07-05 18:39:42 Use up too much farmland that we’ll need for food. Poor overall efficiency. Mainly used at the moment as a sop to head people off the scent of oil, so to speak.
3402 2018-07-05 18:39:26 I thought the last survey I saw had about 80% support for UK conventional oil and gas. So plenty of social license opposed to keepitintheground etc. Only fracking has low support. Not oil and gas per se.
3403 2018-07-05 18:39:12 Our system doesn’t encourage it. Everyone is FAAC dependent. We used to have competition before oil and it inspired some good.

3407 2018-07-05 18:38:44 They don’t have to entrepreneurs. Trade school would be a better bet than most undergrad programs. Go be a welder for a few years or work on an oil rig. 

Make some good money then reassess once you have some life experience
3408 2018-07-05 18:38:31 Remember when the man got snapped in half backwards through a wall? That happened to my Uncle on an oil rig. He suffered greatly
Kevin Dillon rocks!
3409 2018-07-05 18:38:26 Another liberal candidate - yeah except he doesn't know what an idiot he is or that he is as qualified as the guys that change my oil. This pathetic excuse for a human being who is a crook and liar and is the very reason people hate and distrust lawyers should be disbarred.

3414 2018-07-05 18:37:45 Mind-boggling. 
While CNN picked up video from inside the Capital Gazette and another memorial service and marked the 2:33 moment of silence with actual silence, Fox News read the story, barely paused, and immediately went on with news about oil prices. Just classless.
3415 2018-07-05 18:37:45 Thats asking a lot. Trump and wisdom is like water and oil. I know my God is very capable but it is so much to ask.

3421 2018-07-05 18:37:21 I hate the idea of embellishment by media and the snake oil salesmen that will probably try to profit, but as science progresses to determine how the mind works, I feel like there is a part of this that will better prepare folks to deal with it, just like depression or anxiety.
3422 2018-07-05 18:37:19 That's an oil heater, you supposed to flip it so that oil releases the heat from all over the heater. But I know 99% of black people don't flip it, they just switch it on and leave it there. So the oil sits on the bottom and the heater releases less heat
3423 2018-07-05 18:37:18 Actually the studies have not been done on that. Though it does affect dogs more severely especially if large amounts are eaten. I have heard anecdotal accounts of CBD oil being beneficial to older dogs.
3424 2018-07-05 18:37:14 and how long will economic indicators take to reflect downturn? We know POTUS is sensitive to job numbers, oil price, DOW index, etc.

3426 2018-07-05 18:36:49 I would have called him Mr. R. Head. Coal Industry is quite rightly finished. More Oil Industry tarts !!
3427 2018-07-05 18:36:49 p.s put away the strawman, no-one says you claimed oil built the union.

3433 2018-07-05 18:35:57 Rogue state US has always violated fair trade practices.Their slaves like India's Modi was quick to accept the call given by psychopath trump to stop buying Iran oil.
3434 2018-07-05 18:35:57 Oil of horse? What even is that
3435 2018-07-05 18:35:52 So is Saudi Arabia, genius, but that’s not my point.  The market has changed and US reserve expansion has changed it.  The last thing opec wants now is $100 oil.

3439 2018-07-05 18:35:37 Nonono dearie. They are there to protect American interests. Like oil stakes. That is why your president and the GOP keeps em there. You didnt think they were there to bring freedom, did you? Silly sausage.

3441 2018-07-05 18:35:29 And your answer is to INVADE VENEZUELA?  Because Maduro is a dictator who is maltreating his people? 

Are you sure is not bc Venezuela has more oil than Saudi Arabia? 

Yep, that's what I thought!
3442 2018-07-05 18:35:22 This is why I don’t oil my chain.
3443 2018-07-05 18:35:14 After fixing the chain. You need some oil on that very dry chain. Thats prob another reason not moving smoothly.

3513 2018-07-05 18:27:15 The rough consensus is that Groundnut oil is a mix of Groundnut oil + some other cheaper oil. Some say it is palm oil, some cottonseed oil, and some even claim that liquid paraffin is added. Need a Tehelka kind of expose on this. I am worried.
3514 2018-07-05 18:27:06 I also understand wanting to turn E&P into a manufacturing business where you make guaranteed fixed margins... it’s certainly nice to lock in FCF. Also makes them better long-term investments vs just oil price trades
3515 2018-07-05 18:26:57 Gimme a break man.  When oil was 120 a barrel we were paying less than now.  Oil/Gas prices have always been inflated. More bloody hands on gas price F/P/M the more everything costs.  They are squeezing every coin they can between the lot of them!

3518 2018-07-05 18:26:43 “Why is Trump so mean to the EU??”

The only good think Britain ever did was make the colonies that would become the US. Thanks for the oil fuckers.
3519 2018-07-05 18:26:40 There you go again blaming others for you screw ups. You blame others for your mistakes and take credit for others success.  Like writing your books or Puerto Rico. Obama Care. North Korea. Oil Prices. The Election running out of room.
3520 2018-07-05 18:26:36 Turn the oil off and send it where? BC stands in the way of exporting it.
3521 2018-07-05 18:26:27 #EIA pegs #gasoline demand at 9.869 million bpd last week, +164,000 vs year-ago week & the 4-week average at 9.701 bpd is +119,000 vs yr ago; strong demand w/US avg retail price +58.4 cents vs year ago. Unless it's just money shifting from another (soon to sag) sector. #OOTT #oil

3533 2018-07-05 18:24:54 I think it was Grouillard who dropped some oil in the final corner, during the quali session, and Senna spun over it whilst claiming pole, because the finish line was so close to the exit of the final corner.

3555 2018-07-05 18:23:39 I've been using a mixture of rosemary, lavender, tea tree (about 15 drops each), witch hazel, and coconut oil (I didn't measure then just like a healthy amount lol) in an amber lotion bottle. It's the only thing that's made it stop burning/itching.
3556 2018-07-05 18:23:38 Hey Mr. Negotiator you once again showed your hand. You ANNOUNCE you got a verbal agreement for the Saudi’s to increase production because gas prices are rising, letting everyone know the US is unable to negate the upward pressure of pricing! The result, open season on oil prices
3557 2018-07-05 18:23:34 Nah, oil money would snatch him up before he went to United

3559 2018-07-05 18:23:19 $CL_F Lol. So the Saudi Aramco IPO has been called off pretty much indefinitely. MONTHS AGO I called it was a fake narrative 2 artificially keep oil price higher  Today I am proven right. One leg of the stool has been cut off. The $CL_F stool won´t stand straight much longer 
3560 2018-07-05 18:23:12 happy birthday
3561 2018-07-05 18:23:10 Too funny . Who knew they could have a sense of humor . Maybe Trump should stop his sanctions on Iran if he is worried about price of oil .
3562 2018-07-05 18:22:50 Not as much oil left as they claim

3564 2018-07-05 18:22:42 No, you're right... trade wars, rising oil prices, lack of pay increases across the country, children being separated from parents at the border and kept in what amounts to nicer concentration camps, mounting distrust with nearly all allies (but not long-time communist enemies)
3565 2018-07-05 18:22:41 It's been a long emotional couple days.  The last thing I want to do is go to work tonight.  But I think laying out in my pool for an hour may change my mind.  At least that's what I'm telling myself as I grab the suntan oil.
3566 2018-07-05 18:22:27 Lagos is fucking overrated ,you goto work as early as 5am,you can't get home after work if you're with a car,till 9-10-11-12 depending on your location, you repeat same cycle daily,las las u buy bike to evade traffic,Task force go seize am,which way???

3568 2018-07-05 18:22:04 They chose a failed business man. They chose a fast talking snake oil healer. They chose a man who destroyed family businesses by tying them up in court until they had to stop because they ran out of money. No sympathy, no mercy! Hang the, "going out of business sign."
3569 2018-07-05 18:21:59 But there are also the food aspects, additions that you can make to meals which're essentially supplements. Collagen powder is an absolute must! I take 15g in my breakfast & lunch. Whenever I can, I'll try add stuff to meals - ginger powder, olive oil, chilli flakes - all great!

3594 2018-07-05 18:19:12 Not true either, it is to control supply to keep some countries from flooding the market and making oil not profitable for others.

3606 2018-07-05 18:18:40 I agree they are way behind, but the main path to helping them move ahead must solve the grid instability problem (including storage). Kill oil first, and the resultant loss of heating/cooling capacity will kill many of the elderly and the very young.

3611 2018-07-05 18:18:24 Oil broke Tuesday's lows. About the easiest trade to call in the world. So many people let their personal beliefs cloud their view of the charts. It is not even hard to read charts but is more a battle of personal ego/views that foils investors.

3613 2018-07-05 18:18:15 Takes a little while to bring production on line.  It’s not a light switch but rest assured as oil prices increase, US production will be gearing up.  It’s the beauty of a free market.
3614 2018-07-05 18:18:11 Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) chief Mohammad Ali Jaafari has endorsed the notion that Iran would cut off the Straits of Hormuz if any attempt was made to block Iranian oil exports: "this threat may be implemented if necessary."

3628 2018-07-05 18:16:52 We didn’t defend them, we attacked them. And it wasn’t because of weapons of mass destruction, it was because of oil. Read something once in a while

3630 2018-07-05 18:16:38 Brent ICE can't push oil to $80@bbl. Demand continues to bottom out. WTI at $72. Those who bought in July futures are at very high risk.

3632 2018-07-05 18:16:13 I watched this (on the plaza outside Lucas Oil Stadium before Cardale Jones' Ohio St B1G football championship). Watching all that cocktail sauce dripping down faces and staining their t-shirts pink. So gross. And I love that shrimp cocktail. Just not that afternoon.
3633 2018-07-05 18:16:06 If you reduce demand the price of oil drops.

When are you going to take the ICE out of your gas guzzling limo the Beast and start using electricity to move it the few miles it goes?
You waste taxpayer money buying gas.

Solar provides all of the energy I use.
3634 2018-07-05 18:16:06 Even if the Aramco IPO never happens (which is looking more and more likely), that doesn't mean the Saudis don't need $80 oil in order to move forward with its economic transformation. Needs to move beyond oil. That will cost a lot of money.

You decide they don't get support from us, they simply go to your boss Putin, for Russian help. Then they cut off oil sales to us, and gas gets more expensive here, causing the Trump Recession.

3644 2018-07-05 18:15:20 飯食いながら周回しなきゃ
3645 2018-07-05 18:15:15 Are you price fixing or controlling supply and demand? You said the US was self sufficient? How much oil are we exporting rather than stay at home with it ?
3646 2018-07-05 18:15:12 So why are the US oil companies selling overseas? I thought the US was the largest oil producer now.
3647 2018-07-05 18:14:56 surely O'Brien's suffering was more than annual!  :P
3648 2018-07-05 18:14:56 Thank you.  Pure Moroccan oil.  They have good prices at Costco.
3649 2018-07-05 18:14:54 He thinks he can give his presidential order to the demand and supply in the oil market.
3650 2018-07-05 18:14:52 Also big pharmacy pays 2 to 1 in lobbying in Washington over oil. So thank people in your industry for forced vaccinations and high medical costs due to no competition, and the opioid epidemic. Think about that the next time you go to the doctor.

3652 2018-07-05 18:14:49 I'm going to do a video today with my husband, Tim, in regards to the @CanniMed 1:20 CBD oil that I was prescribed for chronic pain.

3653 2018-07-05 18:14:48 The state of things should tell us that no, they don’t have a conscience. They sold off all our oil reserves that was there to buttress us against rising oil prices and to keep price of petrol stable. All so they could have some loot. 
Even the apartheid gov got that right!
3654 2018-07-05 18:14:45 Good morning everyone starting off my day with ibuprofen caffeine and cbd oil hopefully I won’t want to kill myself for at least an hour out of this day
3655 2018-07-05 18:14:45 If Iran was smart it wouldn't do such a thing, nuclear weapons won't make the US re act as fast as Oil will, Oil is one interest that the U.S won't give up easily.

Iran blocks the strait i expect the U.S to delcare war and send it's Navy.

America is a sleeping giant, history.
3656 2018-07-05 18:14:39 And give it to the rich nations? And risk the wealth it takes to do that?  Classic nationalist economics.
No wonder you think 'It's oor oil' pays for 300+yrs of a union. Fgs, even with oil Scotland hasn't paid for itself in 19 of the last 20yrs 
3657 2018-07-05 18:14:37 #Bamteddy Alphanation after insulting bam Wat if her fans refused to view the video u think ur views are enough? Bamfam if u insult Teddy and his fans refuse to buy bam beauty oil do u think u can buy them all?? Las Las we all need each other
3658 2018-07-05 18:14:31 No Aramco IPO.... Sell oil.
3659 2018-07-05 18:14:24 The one that bugs me the most for some reason is the Oil Change place. "Back in my day" lol that was a called job. I'm paying 90$ for a 8 minute oil change, you're simply doing a job, and u want a tip? Hellllll no...lol
3660 2018-07-05 18:14:13 無理だろうとは思うけど、もうこういう事を言う方が出てくるくらい酷い状態って事だよね
3661 2018-07-05 18:14:09 Learned that too. I don’t even use coconut oil anymore. I just use aloe Vera to condition my scalp everyday. My dermatologist said coconut oil can clog pores, it’s not generally not recommended.
3662 2018-07-05 18:14:08 Of the ones which I think are important, but won't be noticeable for having taken them: magnesium, vitamin d&k (when it's not so sunny!) & algae oil (more sustainable than cod liver oil).
And for vanity's sake, biotin in oral spray form - I super-dosed it & wrinkles dropped off!
3663 2018-07-05 18:13:53 Oil price from 2008 till up to date?
3664 2018-07-05 18:13:53 2 hours for an oil change moe
3665 2018-07-05 18:13:53 "The grooviest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3666 2018-07-05 18:13:52 Oil price is Droping Down to $47.10 and this will increase Demand for Shipping industry.
3667 2018-07-05 18:13:49 From a purely energy mix point of view Aviation is virtually entirely oil specific. Reducing carbon emissions happens through improved engine efficiencies but you’re right only fewer aircraft movements will reduce overall emissions. This is unlikely to happen.
3668 2018-07-05 18:13:43 #CongFuelHypocrisy @republic
@INCIndia has created the mess in fuel prices .. Oil Bonds were issued which hv to be repaid now ..The #NDA Govt is bound to honour these #OilBonds .. audit of monies collected agnst Bonds must be done .. Another Scam ..!

3670 2018-07-05 18:13:31 I will remember him by the excellent follow up reporting regarding the BP oil spill 
RIP Ed
3671 2018-07-05 18:13:30 Good question.  One way or another Westminster will try to keep control of the oil.  I was wondering too how will Holyrood deal with companies such as BP
3672 2018-07-05 18:13:27 That's bizarre Poppy opened some olbas oil tonight and told me it was to put in her eyes.  Luckily I snatched it off her before it went south.
3673 2018-07-05 18:13:23 Btw, interesting fact about the fuel prices. If the fuel prices are hiked across the country by the oil cos, the fuel price in Kar goes up further because it is a percentage based cess and not a flat amount.
3674 2018-07-05 18:13:20 I'd say it depends a LOT on the meat and what I'm making -- something like springbok fillet, damn straight that gets fried in a flavour-neutral oil or put on the grill without more than a light dusting of salt and black pepper, because the meat is so delicious on its own.
3675 2018-07-05 18:13:12 3 cylinder saabs, mix oil at gas pump? I did that
3676 2018-07-05 18:12:57 This recipe for brined joy of coconut with olive oil will blow your mind
3677 2018-07-05 18:12:54 I'm no fan of Trump's hardball/hardnose tactics... but I'm fairly sure no single oil producing country would be able to fully control the price of oil PB.
3678 2018-07-05 18:12:48 And who needs all that oil from Alberta, we have lots of gas stations .
3679 2018-07-05 18:12:35 And he said US steel companies would build 6, no 7, new mills in the US. They're not.  Kim Jung Un was going to denuclearize.   He isn't.  Saudi  Arabia agrees to increase oil production to drop out gas prices.  It isn't.  And somebody believes it.

3681 2018-07-05 18:12:26 If you want them strong I suggest investing in a nail oil! Ideally jojoba based. Apply regularly and they'll be strong and have a healthy bend to stop them snapping as much :) I personally use Bliss Kiss but you can find good oil most places!

3685 2018-07-05 18:12:08 They’re wrong no matter the volume of oil they advocate “stay in the ground”.
3686 2018-07-05 18:12:03 Thankfully Candace the US and Venezuela (other than the kleptocratic tendencies of their leaders) have very little in common. Venezuela’s entire economy relies on oil, ours doesn’t. Venezuela has a pegged currency, outs floats. You should feel better now.
3687 2018-07-05 18:11:51 Category 8. Hand, Foot and Nail Care. Not only creams and balms here – but also a nail oil, a nail lacquer and hand washes! #FFSA18
3688 2018-07-05 18:11:45 Some bakeries do both butter and vegetable oil croissants. I prefer the veg ones tbh
3689 2018-07-05 18:11:36 Yes a thread was going around talking about just use coconut oil. They were REALLY getting cooked out here.
3690 2018-07-05 18:11:29 Don't remember the connection between cooking with coconut oil and the amount of ppl by the bathroom. Lol
3691 2018-07-05 18:11:27 p.s it's far far more generous that the greedy grasping nationalist screech of 'It's oor oil'.
And by the way, by roughly the same measure, it was England's coal.

Dave.
3694 2018-07-05 18:11:09 Trump said trade wars won't be so bad; let's see if he'll say the same thing when it comes to the price of oil. We already know he wants to take oil from oil producing middle eastern countries; look for a made up reason for war coming soon. #TheResistanceVOTES #resist
3695 2018-07-05 18:11:01 All in the name of peace

3698 2018-07-05 18:10:33 Really?  Transport trucks ,trains,  planes,  don't run on gas in Ontario?  Oil isn't used in the manufacturing process or production of goods and services ? Boats , farmer and construction equipment all non oil and gas?  Heating and cooling ?  Generation of electricity? Wow, nice
3699 2018-07-05 18:10:33 Sure. @ScottPruittOK is out to line his pockets; he’s in bed with oil companies instead of protecting the environment! If there’s nothing wrong with what he’s doing, why must he have 24/7 security? Why does he need a secret phone booth?
3700 2018-07-05 18:10:33 2 years ago in Crete we had oil that was literally bottled an hour before and was still warm. Oh god it was good.

3704 2018-07-05 18:10:07 It'd be funny if Trump actually does convince Opec to increase production to get oil prices down only to kill the American shale oil industry and send unemployment in Alaska, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Texas through the roof.
3705 2018-07-05 18:10:03 I don't understand what it is you want them to do. Literally every club sells some players. Barca juventus PSG Man Utd, everyone. You say FSG are "bad" owners - who are the "good" owners you want us to have? The man city oil barons? The glazers? Who?
3706 2018-07-05 18:09:58 You'd be hard-pressed to say that anyone (outside of like, Saudi royalty, etc.) in the Middle East has benefited from our cheaper oil costs.

3720 2018-07-05 18:08:50 I’m unimpressed by your survivalist solar panels. “Alternatives” are way behind, and will not catch up without existential impediments to oil.

First of all don't believe everything the right wing preaches.
2nd...the ME? Seriously YOU need to look at the history of the ME, the struggles of the colonial powers and the battle for oil...THEN you come back to me #haveyoualwaysbeenadope ?
3730 2018-07-05 18:07:35 You can imagine anything you like, but it's quite the leap of logic to suggest that a carbon tax costing pennies per barrel would have had a big impact while oil prices cut by half would have been innocuous if only the government were angrier.
3731 2018-07-05 18:07:35 Im just tryna get an oil change right & walmart guy hits me with a “we got 7 cars ahead of you & it’s gonna be almost 3 hours waiting” i was like pos ya que Wey you already took down my damn information & gave me my damn number!
3732 2018-07-05 18:07:30 1) Russia needs oil to be sustained over $68.00 per barrel to boost their poor economy.
2) Removal of US troops from Europe.
3) Undo Mueller indictments of Oligarchs.
4) Russia wants Ukraine bread basket.
5) Russia wants Syria.
3733 2018-07-05 18:07:17 One more thing - India bowed to America on stopping purchase of oil from Iran...

Do u think all these happening without consent of Namo...??
3734 2018-07-05 18:07:15 I fall under the allergy category. Since I’m allergic to most dogs if I ever get one I’d get an Italian Greyhound from a breader. They have extremely short hair and produce cery little oil on there skin. Best option for me. I’d love to rescue but my allergies won’t let me.

3761 2018-07-05 18:04:30 Too bad the government didn't buy a refinery instead of a pipeline. Shipping the oil out is no way for Canadians to enjoy our sovereign natural resources.

3763 2018-07-05 18:04:15 It does have to do with fuel refinery model in SA, relying on imported crude oil for over 60% of SA's fuel is a schlep. Furthermore, suggesting to build a refinery like SASOL only now is bogus. Expert opinion.

3773 2018-07-05 18:03:07 this is so true it shows the panic ... but if u see gold oil ratio its mean reverting ..so if 7 is a low 1250 /7 comes to 166 crude ..
3774 2018-07-05 18:03:03 He is the deputy president of a certain country that Bob once helped when a certain Mark Thatcher was planning a coup.his father is the president and they have a lot of oil money they have used to have this lifestyle whilst their country has nothing to show from the oil money.
3775 2018-07-05 18:02:59 Since hey have oil....
3776 2018-07-05 18:02:46 I wanna get drunk and sing effortless by wale while you rub me down with hemp oil
3777 2018-07-05 18:02:45 Idk, but I do know you can convert most diesel engines to biodiesel. When I was at @Heifer, they had converted an old John Deere 4020 almost entirely to vegetable oil. Ran beautifully.
3778 2018-07-05 18:02:40 Hey "mr president". I think reducing oil prices may not be easy, becouse of your terrying decision to pull out of Iran deal
3779 2018-07-05 18:02:39 Oil changes take up too much of my time
3780 2018-07-05 18:02:34 #Iran:
If #USA can manage to block all our Oil exports, we will block Strait of Hormuz.

USA:
If Iran blocks Strait of Hormuz, we will attack Iran.

...& so my Friends, after a path started not so long ago w/US trashing #IranDeal, we are reaching US End Game long previewed by me.
3781 2018-07-05 18:02:32 The industry didn’t fight back and moved on. Not the same as oil or tobacco. Look, your bike tires and athletic clothing produce synthetic particles that get washed into the ocean. Will you stop biking? Do you expect half of Canada to give up yoga pants?
3782 2018-07-05 18:02:29 i'm picturing 5-8 guys shirtless lathered in Oolong oil. 

Not my cup of tea, but this is where my imagination has brought me
3783 2018-07-05 18:02:29 Rhode Island Sues Oil Companies Over Climate Change, First State to Do So via @RobertKennedyJr
3784 2018-07-05 18:02:16 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
3785 2018-07-05 18:02:12 I guess it depends how long a long term deal is, though the boss of Petronas said they sponsored F1 for years before the Malaysian GP, and would carry on after the race was dropped. They are a huge oil company, they can easily afford both.
3786 2018-07-05 18:02:10 we all bleed the same
3787 2018-07-05 18:02:06 Just reduced tomatoes, basil, olive oil, black pepper, and sometimes pine nuts if i have them. I usually have pine nuts who am i kidding. Also have you tried orzo? Like a cross between rice and gnocchi but pasta.
3788 2018-07-05 18:01:55 Coconut oil works every time! 
3789 2018-07-05 18:01:49 I doubt that, the sanctions aren't even being felt yet. Going to get worse before it gets better.  Oil looking for 80.
3790 2018-07-05 18:01:42 @realDonaldTrump Just want to thank you again for transferring my tax cut to BIG OIL!!!!  Your stupid Israeli centered policies stink.  I am a supporter of yours.  MAGA

3795 2018-07-05 18:00:46 Why are we US Army searching for Oil or Yallah Habibi ? 
3796 2018-07-05 18:00:43 Do you think that it may have something to do with firing Rex Tillerson and not the Iran deal that we never got oil from in the first place? Serious question.

3799 2018-07-05 18:00:35 p.s  One of the world's biggest financial centre that's been at the forefront of world finance for centuries but you're saying Scotland's oil paid for all they have? That's feckin hilarious, in fact it's beyond hilarious.

3804 2018-07-05 18:00:15 Logical possibly, but I read somewhere that oil by rail would stay at full capacity pipeline or no pipeline... Truth or not? Yet another thing that should be aired out fully by the involved parties.
3805 2018-07-05 17:59:51 During Thabo Mbeki era oil was at around 110 plus dollars a barrel. But the petrol price has never been as high as it now is. This boggles my mind.
3806 2018-07-05 17:59:47 I like this idea, but it was probably a Koch trip for oil.
3807 2018-07-05 17:59:43 maybe he just wants to take Venezuela's oil..
3808 2018-07-05 17:59:40 @StoneacreMotors couldn’t be any madder right now with stoneacre, got a 17 plate in Feb and took it to a Ford garage to be told when stoneacre changed the oil they have punctured the filter!! And then they expect me to pay for courtesy car insurance from something they damaged!!
3809 2018-07-05 17:59:35 Keep up the lies.
How much is nog oil paying you?
3810 2018-07-05 17:59:28 take that an amazing amount of people find crazy for some reason: fuck the interests of big oil companies, legislation needs to be passed that drives them out of business and forces workers into jobs working with renewable energy.
3811 2018-07-05 17:59:25 NOV 4th When Iran sells oil to China, Turkey & Europe? We go to war with Iran? I guess Israel is gonna take the hit for false evidence of WMD this time? The USD is on a fast track to devalue. Todays tough trade talk is panic our allies wont defend the USD$  4 false flag attacks
3812 2018-07-05 17:59:24 The climate change we are seeing today is not a natural, cyclical change. It is grossly accelerated and man made. The only people saying otherwise are oil and gas lobbyists and science denialists.
3813 2018-07-05 17:59:14 Okay @angelayee that tan got a sista glowing (or maybe it just the oil) but it still looks amazing.
3814 2018-07-05 17:59:08 Quite sure that everyone would rather that. Unless you can point to someone who wants to spill oil into the ocean. .  
I'll wait.
3815 2018-07-05 17:59:05 YES! Even coconut oil is bomb
3816 2018-07-05 17:59:00 

And there's that greedy 'It's oor oil' I was talking about. No mention of the 250yrs when there was no oil, the beginning of the union when Scotland was bankrupt, etc. Selective memory from the greedy nationalist.
3817 2018-07-05 17:58:50 Been having my car 3 yrs now, and today was the first time I had to pay for an oil change.... lol
3818 2018-07-05 17:58:42 I'm sure he'll add tariffs to the oil to own the libs........
3819 2018-07-05 17:58:41 There is no level playing field today. Yet in a world without pre developed tech for either solar or oil, oil would win because it costs less to sustain production at the level people need in ways they can conveniently use.
3820 2018-07-05 17:58:40 Then you must have traded in peanuts, I travelled /traded & remember those countries all having different regs/stds so a nightmare!, I traded in those days in oil/gas equipment . Post EU it became much much easier as regs/ stds were harmonised & trade boomed. Back to bad old days
3821 2018-07-05 17:58:39 GOOD NEWS.  THINK WE CAN TAKE OUT THE SEAT BELTS? MAYBE GET BACK OUR LOWER MILEAGE PER GALLON OF THAT GOOD OLD TAR SANDS OIL GAS? DIDN'T YOU ALL LOVE THE 8-TRACKS? TO HEAR YOUR FAVORITE SONG AGAIN, YOU JUST WAIT 30 OR 40 MINUTES & IT WILL COME AROUND AGAIN. AH, THE GOOD OLE DAYS.
3822 2018-07-05 17:58:30 Part 4. so 2 weeks go by he parks his car in front of owe house my brother ask him to move it cause it was leaking oil every where the he went of on one again screaming a shouting his head off.
3823 2018-07-05 17:58:23 @jacqules Also have you guys considered the fact that we build oil pipelines all over the world and water might be even more precious than oil so why can’t we build a pipeline to Canada Alaska and import massive amounts of water to fill recreational areas
3824 2018-07-05 17:58:16 The wounded refused edibles and CBD oil opting instead for the pacifiers taken from the infants they have caged!
3825 2018-07-05 17:58:10 @SimonTSN690 

Jeff has done the heavy minutes on a crap d line before.  Check out his time in Oil Country
3826 2018-07-05 17:58:02 Venezuela has the worlds largest oil reserves- it could virtually eliminate poverty within 10-15 years I imagine if run properly. It’s crackdown on any form of social and political dissent is very Corbyn its though- Aaron Bastani and Zarb cousin would be very proud!
3827 2018-07-05 17:57:31 Holy shit. So sorry. With everything that’s in the news about cannabis I’d say you’d benefit from using a pure CBD oil or some just good proper bud high in CBD but with low THC. Maybe research and see what you think. All the best
3828 2018-07-05 17:57:18 Yeah, the more you and the oil industry lie, the more Elon responds.
3829 2018-07-05 17:57:17 I also smell like Cantu products and essential oil lmao
3830 2018-07-05 17:57:03 Just thinking about Zim industry. Here in SA there are a few million Zimbos who could buy more Zim products & support our industry. In PTA we buy Mazoe for R65 coz we grew up drinking them. Where are the other products e.g. Roil c/oil if they are permitted to come through.
3831 2018-07-05 17:56:44 Yeah but then a handful of oil company ceo's won't continue to make a bajillion dollars off of ruining the planet
3832 2018-07-05 17:56:42 Micellar. Gasuka yg mengandung oil kalo buat bersihin, lengket kemana2 kayanya.
3833 2018-07-05 17:56:39 So I guess blk voter should go to the republican plantation, where they are stopping . Ppl from voting or where there President is habitual liers. Or where the last president stated a war for oil or where the Regan administration. Poured drugs into their communities who wants it.
3834 2018-07-05 17:56:31 u can use almond oil for smooth lips and hair.
3835 2018-07-05 17:56:20 Electricity @ cost of circular debt..... n high per unit cost when price of crude oil is at lowest... n high inflation, n ..... n.....
3836 2018-07-05 17:56:15 @PortiaM_Skin . I had really bad acne dark spots and stretch marks . I’m using their oil for the second week now and there’s a visible difference
3837 2018-07-05 17:56:07 I always thought oil cleansers are only for removing makeup so I never thought I needed it. Boyyy was I wrong
3838 2018-07-05 17:55:55 You've clearly got big oil freaking out. You're a threat to their gravy train. Not to mention the arms industry that makes billions from wars waged for oil.

Keep up the good work.
I will keep buying Tesla stock, no matter what those fools print.
3839 2018-07-05 17:55:52 SCO NOT RELATIVELY RESPONDING TO OIL PRICE DROP AND SUPPLY NEWS... THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS ON THE BULL SIDE UCO ETC... SOME ONE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE MANAGEMENT OVER THERE..
3840 2018-07-05 17:55:32 You should go tell the oil companies then to build Refineries in Canada. Go on, we're depending on you!
3841 2018-07-05 17:55:32 Any poultry is good with solely Lawry's while any pork/beef is good with just Lawry's, pepper, a drop or two of oil & Worcestershire
3842 2018-07-05 17:55:27 Wonder if @northropgrumman will do the right thing and fire Michael Miselis and oh wait no they are more interested in building things to rain death on developing countries so we can take their oil
3843 2018-07-05 17:55:22 Cleansing oil
3844 2018-07-05 17:55:15 Have you ever tried CBD oil treats for dogs?
3845 2018-07-05 17:55:12 can be nice with some grilled summer squash and a little olive oil
3846 2018-07-05 17:55:11 ive never even heard of lip oil 
3847 2018-07-05 17:55:03 Lol always huh? So if I pointed out the Koch Brothers, would that make you look like a wetbrained dipshit? How about those in charge of every oil company? Telecom companies? The corporate masters want republican control because they hand over power easily
3848 2018-07-05 17:54:59 So a level playing field at the start favors oil, but a level playing field now favors what again?
3849 2018-07-05 17:54:52 Surprise Valvoline instant oil change in Downey, CA please on Saturday July 7 at Noon

3853 2018-07-05 17:54:35 They're also delicious sauteed in a little olive oil with garlic and pepper.
3854 2018-07-05 17:54:32 @tdichristopher, I wish you’d included weekly US oil export vs foreign-oil import numbers—&weekly export of US gasoline. Readers might also appreciate knowing how much of US oil is used by foreign refineries in USA—versus who’s using the higher-priced ~7 MBPD foreign oil imports.
3855 2018-07-05 17:54:22 I think he, Mnuchin and Mulvanney are trying to figure a way to do exactly that. So far, Mulvanney has shrunk the number of government employees, now Mnuchin is trying to get more money in. Invade Venezuela? Sure, they have oil...
3856 2018-07-05 17:54:16 Yes, it is. It's just cycled through, like any  other building heating system. Like the old radiator systems. Only instead of a boiler, the liquid (doesn't even need to be water - oil is better in fact) is heated by capturing ground heat and transferring it with heat exchangers.
3857 2018-07-05 17:54:07 I need to get an oil change and go grocery shopping but I don’t want to get out of bed, help
3858 2018-07-05 17:54:04 The regime's fear and discontent for #UnitedStates' #ForeignPolicy is what will drive up the oil prices. #TrueIran #BoldPolicy
3859 2018-07-05 17:53:57 Where is that Minister that sold our oil reserves.
3860 2018-07-05 17:53:55 I put baby oil on and just get tan.. try it
3861 2018-07-05 17:53:39 I like it! Try greasing up the pole to prevent the squirrels from climbing up.  I’ve used pam spray or canola oil in the past... it worked.

3871 2018-07-05 17:52:07 @realDonaldTrump be rest assured that the real owners of Oil and Gas in a Country called #NIGERIA will be are ready to make a deal with #America.
3872 2018-07-05 17:52:01 it's going the next step after US limiting the exports of sensitive technologies to Russian oil companies. Trump can do little - US Congress plays crucial role in establishing sanctions against Russia, Trump has to follow its will of face imminent impeachment.
3873 2018-07-05 17:51:48 I don’t like it when you are getting an oil change and they try to supersize the bill with things you don’t really need.
3874 2018-07-05 17:51:46 Walk, cycle or take public transit- don’t give your hard earned money to big oil and the taxman.

3879 2018-07-05 17:51:22 I convinced my dad to change my oil filter lmao. Car maintenance costs makes me want to die lol
3880 2018-07-05 17:51:16 To further their conspiracy. Lifting sanctions, developing an axis of dictators, and oil, oil, oil.
3881 2018-07-05 17:51:15 I’ve been waiting for like 45 minutes to get my oil changed and I’m like about to leave but I really shouldn’t cause the oil life in my car is at -72
3882 2018-07-05 17:51:07 Right now, an innocent corper somewhere is getting a message from one MICHAEL THANKGOD that claims to work in S.P.D.C, Agip oil company in Bayelsa state and is currently doing an urgent internal employment. 

Dear Corp members, don’t fall victim. Congrats on your P.O.P  
3883 2018-07-05 17:51:07 I walked into CVS yesterday and overheard a man asking for coconut oil because “he needs to tan” #BeBold

3885 2018-07-05 17:50:54 กูก็ไม่รู้หรอกว่ากูเป็นตัวเหี้ยอะไรสำหรับมึง กูรู้แต่ว่ากูซื่อสัตย์กับมันแค่คนเดียว 
3886 2018-07-05 17:50:51 canadian conservatives are just angry their oil royalties are not longer gushing in, their robot leader lost, and their gomer replacement leader is such a sad sack. i don’t blame them. i’d be frustrated too.
3887 2018-07-05 17:50:50 i know nothing about him except he bones the mc so hard he gets destroyed

i bet he comes motor oil that seems like smth dmmd would do
3888 2018-07-05 17:50:44 Why is that exactly, and don't tell me price of oil has anything to do with it as I know thats BS. So what is the price based on really?
3889 2018-07-05 17:50:44 Covers himself in baby oil
3890 2018-07-05 17:50:41 Tea tree oil everyday?
3891 2018-07-05 17:50:38 Sooo olive oil, garlic salt, and lemon pepper are good.
3892 2018-07-05 17:50:33 And you thought oil was pricy!!!  It will be a drop in the bucket - pun intended - in comparison to what water will be gouging for (sorry, couldn’t resist)!
3893 2018-07-05 17:50:26 ion put no chemicals in my baby hair oil & liv only
3894 2018-07-05 17:50:12 It simply is not sustainable. Problem must be addressed in resident countries. Too bad not enough oil for interest like  for tRump.
3895 2018-07-05 17:50:12 Yip, refusing to recycle plastic means drilling for more oil, which isn't great for oceans either.
3896 2018-07-05 17:49:55 A guess: It was your Peak Oil year. Domestic supply couldn’t keep up with demand. OPEC was flooding the global market with cheap product. Inflation & CPI were being driven up. Richie Rich needed to cover his ass.
3897 2018-07-05 17:49:53 At work talking to a truck driver:
Me: "Are you parked or hands-free?"
Driver: "Huh?"
Me: "Are you parked or hands-free?"
Driver: "Oil?"
Me: ".......no.."

3901 2018-07-05 17:49:24 Hey ladies and fellas! My sister was asking me about beard cream/oil or whatever it’s called this morning. What would y’all recommend?
3902 2018-07-05 17:49:23 The CBD oil has helped my anxiety and pain, and I am so thankful to have found this product! @KimCorser check this out and enter to win. Xoxo
3903 2018-07-05 17:49:18 Venezuela has plenty and they are starving to death. I am sure they will sell oil to us
3904 2018-07-05 17:49:05 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
3905 2018-07-05 17:49:03 Nice one megs, next you will be checking the oil and tyre pressure  xx
3906 2018-07-05 17:48:59 And I’m pretty sure they would rather the oil is used to make products instead of spilling into the oceans and rivers without any proper plan to clean it up imho.
3907 2018-07-05 17:48:36 I hate getting an oil change
3908 2018-07-05 17:48:33 Birthday wishes Engineer 
3909 2018-07-05 17:48:25 I think it’s all the olive oil when I season
3910 2018-07-05 17:48:23 He should have been removed a long time ago.  He is committing Treason against Mother Earth...and she will exact her payment.  It is her nature.  The oil & coal companies have not even imagined payment that will be demanded; nor have Congress & GOP Voters who are complicit.
3911 2018-07-05 17:48:16 If I had a choice between Cannabis oil and the shit my doctors prescribe me, I’d chose the Cannabis oil.
3912 2018-07-05 17:48:13 Do you honestly believe a pure capitalist Venezuela would have weathered the price of crude oil tanking?
3913 2018-07-05 17:48:07 If I find oil I will never have to work again and neither will my blood line.... so now that’s my goal of 2018 to find some oil and purchase a well.
3914 2018-07-05 17:48:05 Saudi Arabia cut pricing for most of its oil grades as the world’s biggest crude exporter is increasing production to assure buyers there is sufficient supply following U.S. President Donald Trump’s demands that #OPEC do more to stabilize oil markets
3915 2018-07-05 17:47:53 Do you have any lavender oil ??
3916 2018-07-05 17:47:52 put tanning oil on just the spots that are lighter 
3917 2018-07-05 17:47:33 He wants their oil. Simple.
3918 2018-07-05 17:47:13 Cars are the worst thing ever. You go in for an oil change and then find out you need over $1,000 of work on it. Jesus take the wheel.
3919 2018-07-05 17:47:12 Service is horrible at @NorthCountyBCG . Had to remind them to get my oil change in after waiting 2 hours. Car was just sitting there.
3920 2018-07-05 17:47:11 oh! and a light olive oil rub right before setting to smoke.
3921 2018-07-05 17:47:01 Toss a handful of kale with olive oil, 1/2 cup chickpeas, 1/4 cup cooked quinoa, 1 tablespoon of pesto. Top with sliced cucumber, tomato, red onion, and a lean protein. #CHNeats
3922 2018-07-05 17:46:56 Also I believe we take care of securing the region for them that should be worth them producing more oil
3923 2018-07-05 17:46:50 I have to go get an oil change today 
3924 2018-07-05 17:46:45 It's no surprise to those of us paying attention. If Venezuela has the largest oil deposit in the world, why not you spread so-called democracy there like they did in other parts of the world. But people are waking up because of the internet.
3925 2018-07-05 17:46:35 unless you are rolling in millions he doesn’t give one shit about you. Hate to say it, but you’ve been sold snake oil. I’m a moderate and can see it clearly.
3926 2018-07-05 17:46:18 Kuch log apne apko Meezan Cooking Oil main fry bhi kar lain tab bhi achay nahi lagtay!
3927 2018-07-05 17:46:13 I'm planning on anointing the walls of the NHS hospitals with Holy oil later if you fancy joining me?
3928 2018-07-05 17:46:08 Coconut oil or Vaseline
3929 2018-07-05 17:45:52 What happens when you run out of other people's oil.
3930 2018-07-05 17:45:50 Serum then oil
3931 2018-07-05 17:45:45 Where is magic label Made in Russia? Oil&Gas from Russia for us! 
3932 2018-07-05 17:45:41 You don't want higher prices because it'll affect the number of GOP elected in Nov. We imported most of our oil from Canada but now you've started a trade war with them. See how that works? Saudi doesn't need us.
3933 2018-07-05 17:45:35 The Bush presidents entire war was ,about Sadam wanted Kuwait,oil and pipelines,Saudi got nervous and wanted our protection also
3934 2018-07-05 17:45:31 My Mom would put baby oil on and head out for the day.
3935 2018-07-05 17:45:27 I'm not sure if @DrPunkNomad realizes how oil prices work.
3936 2018-07-05 17:45:17 Logical fallacy again... I've never said we should live without all oil. I've in fact said a few things that make your post look completely idiotic.
3937 2018-07-05 17:45:12 Will USA take up the losses of  ? Its a sensitive issue for NaMo with elections next year & high oil prices will impact chances of getting majority in Parliament.
3938 2018-07-05 17:45:07 As for your linear logic argument. Was there a knock on effect from switching from the gold standard to the oil standard? Yes, gold prices dipped for a few years but made a full recovery not long after so that argument also falls flat. Now I've answered your statements, your turn
3939 2018-07-05 17:45:04 Karnataka me farmer loan wavier diya.. Aur oil price 2% badha diya.. Farmers ka loan humse hi vasool ker le rhe ye log.
3940 2018-07-05 17:45:02 What's your stance on conserving the climate balance of the planet? Or are you more for conserving oil profits?
3941 2018-07-05 17:44:48 I quite agree. We seem to create problems not solve them. Would be better to trade with those who are less warlike. The Saudis are an example of where they are very warlike but unfortunately they have most of the cheap oil. A recipe for totalitarianism. Which is what they have.
3942 2018-07-05 17:44:44 I continue to have my stomach popped by oil or burned by something else in the pan when I cook cuz I don’t wear shirts !!! Never learn
3943 2018-07-05 17:44:34 Oil is traded on MARKETS you blooming idiot. Funny how much LOWER gas prices were under anti-drilling Obama. Another GOPer president = gas prices spike. Happens every time.
3944 2018-07-05 17:44:20 why tf does A tire and oil change take 4 hours 
3945 2018-07-05 17:44:20 Oil prices about to sky rocket if geopolitics plays out.
3946 2018-07-05 17:44:15 Neither did I until I got tired of $80 oil changes lmao
3947 2018-07-05 17:44:06 روعه نهله احسنتي
3948 2018-07-05 17:44:00 Cause you didn’t get an oil change?!
3949 2018-07-05 17:43:59 No haven’t taken it out yet but I think I will in a month if it’s not better so I’ll just pray tea tree oil works
3950 2018-07-05 17:43:56 ALSO: why aren’t you tweeting and promoting how we are “oil independent” and we have a plus on that side. That’s one of your big arguments during the campaign.
3951 2018-07-05 17:43:44 Everyone I know laughed. If AB cut off oil supply to BC, it would have minimal impact on everything except directly affected jobs. Not like you BC gets refined crude, it's dirty bitumen. Whereas BC can cut off hydro electric supply to Alberta, and AB would be completely fucked.
3952 2018-07-05 17:43:23 Question for the time line? How is dangote able to afford a privately owned oil refinery on Nigerian soil but WE NIGERIANS DONT HAVE ANY? we're on twitter laughing at jokes when we're the real joke.
3953 2018-07-05 17:43:13 Get Pam spray. I use the olive oil kind.

8 minutes in boiling water. Perfect soft boiled eggs. Store them in frig for later. Short nuke in the microwave to warm up.
3954 2018-07-05 17:43:12 Keto is good for balancing hormones &feeding your reproductive organs the raw nutrients they need to function optimally. There’s many supplements that can assist with this as well such as wild carrot, fish oil, Chasteberry (vitex), verbena, calcium & magnesium.
3955 2018-07-05 17:43:11 He had no time for other scenarios re: rising oil prices changing demand.

He's just as, shall we say "passionate", in person as he is in his books. It's hard to take that kind of polemic even when you agree with him, cf Geography of Nowhere.
3956 2018-07-05 17:43:05 Help with oil prices and gas prices.  Prices are to high.  @realDonaldTrump
3957 2018-07-05 17:42:48 You are NO FISCAL CONSERVTIVE bc if you were you’d never let Pearson Pub own TX schools. If you were you’d oppose the tariffs affecting oil&gas JOBS in TX.If you were, you’d oppose the tariffs to pecan FARMERS IN TX. If you were you’d the higher % posed by Trump for your METALS
3958 2018-07-05 17:42:47 We are already seeing the impact.  Rising sea levels are threatening coastal communities. 
Rising Temps and drought follow.

OH & my ecology 101 class discussed at length, future wars will be fought  over water not oil.
3959 2018-07-05 17:42:47 And did you know, Ross, that air conditioners and refrigerators use oil and plastics made from FF. Care to live without A/C and Refrigeration?
3960 2018-07-05 17:42:46 @africatechie I don't get the fuss on @EmmanuelMacron speakx pidgin when millions of #Africans speak #French. He is there for oil
3961 2018-07-05 17:42:43 If oil is made from decomposed 
dinosaurs, and plastic is made
from oil- plastic dinosaurs are
made from real dinosaurs.
3962 2018-07-05 17:42:37 I just got oil all over the side of my face and I tasted it
3963 2018-07-05 17:42:36 Iran oil?I don’t  think so!
3964 2018-07-05 17:42:23 lush has foundation sticks but the first ingredient is coconut oil. big ol' NOPE from me thanks
3965 2018-07-05 17:42:22 This logic can not hold as not so affluent people also buy petrol. Farmers too buy diesel for their tractors etc. Increase in diesel price will surely affect the poor and farmers. More over Rahul Gandhi was blaming central Govt over invrease in oil prices. Why double standards?
3966 2018-07-05 17:42:21 Stock options.. where will price of oil go?
3967 2018-07-05 17:42:07 @arrington_grant can I cover you in olive oil??
3968 2018-07-05 17:42:05 Price of oil is s lot higher to :)
3969 2018-07-05 17:41:58 “ Learning to trade big oil or any of the super seven is a great skill set to acquire.  Big oil is handing out some of the largest paychecks to date right now “ - #NdifrekeSylvanusOkon
3970 2018-07-05 17:41:58 Fuel prices are up because of Trump. He shouldn't have imposed sanctions on Iran. We are suffering because of his stupidity. Now Iran is hinting that if the crisis worsens it may block the strait of Hormuz, the key oil supply route. This will shoot up the prices further.
3971 2018-07-05 17:41:58 Ano passado não sei se foi influência do show do midnight oil que vi na semana anterior mas achei o show dele morno... foi meia Allianz, cadeiras e não lotou...
3972 2018-07-05 17:41:56 Maybe. Because so many Americans are now HALF white...   Bi racial...  like me. !  Prediction in 30 Years we will all look the same... No more OIL... no more RACISM.   There'll be nothing to live for but peace & quiet....Ooommmm
3973 2018-07-05 17:41:46 What oil price recovery?  What was the average oil price for the past three years versus the 3-4 years before that?
3974 2018-07-05 17:41:40 Yes, an i do remember the "frog in slowly boiling water" commercial before movies when i was young. Also the big oil corporations knew all the time how harmful their ways were. But somehow they convinced politicians and those their voters that it was 50/50 uncertain or a hoax.
3975 2018-07-05 17:41:27 Verified: Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Verified: The Kremlin targeted educated youth and swing state voters during its cyber attacks in the campaign. Verified: Trump maintains ties to rich businessmen from Azerbaijan. Google it
3976 2018-07-05 17:41:24 I met Mr Kunstler around a decade ago. He is a hard man to talk to, a true dystopian. At the time, anyway, he truly believed peak oil would happen overnight and we'd be nearly reduced to Day After Tomorrow living with local farming.
3977 2018-07-05 17:41:23 I haven’t seen a tin of patination oil for many a year! Undercloak, overcloak, mopstick! That takes me back to my apprenticeship
3978 2018-07-05 17:41:16 I feel this feel (my car takes the same oil). It's like $40 or less if you do it yourself tho 
3979 2018-07-05 17:41:07 Why are we even shipping oil overseas when we need it here in base to pay cheap prices in Gas? Now it is an offensive act of our government and the east to be receiving oil from Venezuela. It’s incoherent behaviour is unfit for our parliament. Canadians don’t want Venezuelan oil
3980 2018-07-05 17:41:04 OPEC formed so that the profit from the oil went to the countries it came from and would no longer be stolen by imperialist nations.  They can sell it whom they like for what they like #TheirNaturalResource if only there was a plan to stop using fossil fuels...
3981 2018-07-05 17:40:40 Want to join the cause? Stop on by our location on Cassopolis St. We still have available appointments and limited Cedar Point tickets with a free oil change certificate. We are here until 4pm! See you soon!
3982 2018-07-05 17:40:40 Venezuela’s issues are much more complex than just being a socialist country. They have the largest amount of proven oil reserves in the world. It was poor leadership, corruption, and making bad deals that caused their economy to crash.
3983 2018-07-05 17:40:39 If cocoa,bauxite,manganese, crude oil couldn't help us its never India hemp that will.
3984 2018-07-05 17:40:39 “We went to war because of our dependence on foreign oil
We went to war because of money
We will settle for nothing less than victory
We will settle for nothing less than crude oil”
3985 2018-07-05 17:40:38 Ran across some infused coconut oil and MY N*GGA 
3986 2018-07-05 17:40:36 @enterprisecares we have a can in desperate need of an oil change. Please help!

3991 2018-07-05 17:40:01 Between tomorrow morning & Saturday I have to find time to get a oil change, brakes looked at, pedicure, fill-in, & look for a outfit for Saturday  help me Lord
3992 2018-07-05 17:40:00 Venezuela’s economy crashed because it was completely dependent on its oil exports, when gas prices fell so did there economy
3993 2018-07-05 17:39:56 i done put this oil in my head now it itcg
3994 2018-07-05 17:39:54 #Trump wants to invade #Venezuela because it's the country with the most beauty pageant winners and oil. He's gonna get paid and get laid.
3995 2018-07-05 17:39:42 Either way, an oil change is a hell of a lot cheaper than a new vehicle.
3996 2018-07-05 17:39:29 one time, doing bottle tokes will hash oil...
3997 2018-07-05 17:39:28 'Har, har, one and all, hearken over here! Sample my wares! I've got for you Golden Elixir of Coal Oil! Drain a bottle and drain that swampy feel inside yur belly! Only $10 a bottle! Special offer, 10 bottles for $100!!!"
3998 2018-07-05 17:39:26 The 3rd largest reserve of oil in the world and we pay 2x what an ave. U.S. commuter pays. Thanks for the oppression Liberals.
3999 2018-07-05 17:39:22 Soak in a lavender oil bath, should go away quickly
4000 2018-07-05 17:39:15 Why Colorado thinks it has a chance to make oil companies pay for climate change - Vox
4001 2018-07-05 17:39:04 He won’t say anything. Predictable. He will blame it on oil, which everyone knows is a cop out.
4002 2018-07-05 17:39:01 ちょw
4003 2018-07-05 17:38:52 We better stay out of Venezuela or we are going to end up with more refugees on our doorstep.  Are we going to fight in Venezuela for our freedom?  No.  Religious rights? No they’re Christians.   They already have a democratic government.  Oil! That it.
4004 2018-07-05 17:38:49 @HSEBDEA All the honored members of HSEBDEA are requested to  share their view regarding  the LONG out standing demands of all the Junior Engineers of UHBVN & DHBVN like waiving off  shortage of oil and parts of txfr, stagnation in promotion, no time scale & ACP for JE/JE-1 etc.
4005 2018-07-05 17:38:47 Not until the pipeline is finished.  Then oil can be sold elsewhere at higher prices.
4006 2018-07-05 17:38:42 Certainly positive news for the economy as oil prices rise and become more volatile.
4007 2018-07-05 17:38:20 I got my oil changed on Tuesday and received no ice cream 
4008 2018-07-05 17:38:15 I tried a tanning bed one year in my 20s, wasn't impressed, but it's a wonder we aren't all covered with skin cancer from our "frying in oil" days.
4009 2018-07-05 17:38:12 I wonder if they are just trying to keep the price of oil high. Good strategy if so.
4010 2018-07-05 17:38:07 Sadly palm oil is not good for you.
4011 2018-07-05 17:38:02 Yep and they, frankly, suck at managing financial crises. Yet Aberdeen has been in the middle of a financial slump for a few years now & the best the SNP can do is offer to re-train oil workers as teachers which is a ridiculous idea if ever I heard one.
4012 2018-07-05 17:37:55 Its weird I don't a runny nose or anything just an unbearable headache. I will try the axe oil. Thank you
4013 2018-07-05 17:37:40 [citation needed]
4014 2018-07-05 17:37:28 Thanks. I just wanted to know if Total’s 20% total oil control in Nigeria is a step up or step down and by how much
4015 2018-07-05 17:37:23 Not to mention I also need an oil change  let’s hope my car doesn’t explode like that one spring break in Port A!
4016 2018-07-05 17:37:18 Actually, KM shut down due to the political uncertainty of the project. Profitability was not an issue. #FactsMatter. Anyone not supporting the import of oil into the lower mainland is living in a bubble. Try flying out of Vancouver or Victoria without using imported oil.
4017 2018-07-05 17:37:16 I’d strongly suggest Investors “Short Oil”; not “Tesla”. Which one has the brightest future?

4020 2018-07-05 17:36:59 When the nation’s premier oil refinery is allegedly shutting down due to losses then we need to re-evaluate the management processes of state owned entities. God help us
4021 2018-07-05 17:36:50 #WeDontBelieveYou Its YOUR fault that prices are higher you #FuckingMoron. Between backing out of the Iran deal, pissing Arab nations off by backing Israel as they gunned down Arabs, and enabling Russia's oil exports to double under your watch it all falls on you

4022 2018-07-05 17:36:35 @Big_Orrin nothing interesting happening in the oil market today.." Amazing how prod. cuts, prices, sanctions etc. have pushed Saudi IPO right back into the woodwork... Not a word on it for weeks... will it ever come back ??

4025 2018-07-05 17:36:17 I usually make some toast with pieces of avocado,then I add some salt and pepper. For lunch, I cut in small pieces avocado, onions, tomatoes,pepper(the vegetable), and boiled chickpea. I add some olive oil,a little of lemon juice and salt. 
4026 2018-07-05 17:36:13 Oilers were 10.  While there had been Faulk rumors over last yr or 2 they’d never swap the guy they got for Faulk.  Maybe just a good yr & fortunate pick for Oil.  But don’t over rate JF.
4027 2018-07-05 17:36:11 So why is Green Peace not protesting Foreign oil Tankers on the East Coast or the foreign oil being refined in Quebec Refineries ? Green Peace the best protesters money can buy.
4028 2018-07-05 17:35:59 This is great they robbed our state of our coal while Alaska gets royalties off their oil we get nothing but fixing our roads now will have no trees mudslides
4029 2018-07-05 17:35:55 Use @PortiaM_Skin skin oil. It's very good.
4030 2018-07-05 17:35:52 I am getting an oil change now then I think I’m going through the drive through because j need to pack and get ready for work 
4031 2018-07-05 17:35:42 USA one of the top 3 consumers of oil ,if we stopped buying it would hurt their bottom line, and that’s what most of them care about not ppl and opec certainly doesn’t care about ppl  so why not pressure them to increase production and lower prices buy having surpluses

4037 2018-07-05 17:35:04 The price “collapse” was an almost 2 year process. Job loss counts (while guestimates) are generally cold data. Since the last oil price decline (sector job loss) took place during the Obama admin I’ll assume you believe the sam bias of reporting was working against him as well.

4045 2018-07-05 17:34:06 U do realize ethanol is so damn cheap right now your cost per mile is damn near 1/2. Of course big oil has tried to dismantle it so it’s hard to find and mark up is huge. Raw product is stupid cheap. E30 would Increase ethanol demand. Lower cost at the pump.  And it’s made in USA
4046 2018-07-05 17:34:02 My biggest problem with Jones is that “believes” seems to be the wrong word.

It’s not at all clear that he believes anything he says, which makes him a snake oil salesman.

4048 2018-07-05 17:33:58 The #UnitedStates and #SaudiArabia appear to have reached an understanding: Washington will reduce or eliminate #Iran’s oil export revenues and in return Riyadh will guarantee #oil supplies and stabilise prices.  - wait, why do we still have #opec? Awfully convenient. #oott
4049 2018-07-05 17:33:55 Welp I got 2-3 weeks to flush it. Probably just have to do an oil change lol
4050 2018-07-05 17:33:54 Or holy oil
4051 2018-07-05 17:33:54 If it hurts, or if you want to help with redness. Use lavender and peppermint essential oil with liquid coconut oil and Mary Kay cool gel. Mix it together and apply it with a cotton ball or just directly onto the skin. :)
4052 2018-07-05 17:33:46 This would be an amazing university architecture studio project: adaptive re-use of oil rigs.
4053 2018-07-05 17:33:41 Hahaha- I used baby oil back in the day! I meant the creepy tanning booths when I said pods :D They remind me of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
I love eggs... just not runny :D And pile on the bacon!!
4054 2018-07-05 17:33:29 im just letting the oil dry MaAm/!
4055 2018-07-05 17:33:28 got my oil change, next week I gotta get my car detailed and stuff
4056 2018-07-05 17:33:24 Need me some tea tree oil
4057 2018-07-05 17:33:19 No it’s not. It’s made from wheat, potatoes, and coconut oil. And it’s delicious.
4058 2018-07-05 17:33:14 I have selected these olive oil brands as better choices 

SPITIKO GREEK OLIVE OIL

4059 2018-07-05 17:33:02 Have you tried cbd oil for your anxiety?
4060 2018-07-05 17:32:31 if your car needs an oil change my face has you covered 
4061 2018-07-05 17:32:30 wait...the olive oil one I think I knew from like food network but pickle ice cream is a thing? well damn okay
4062 2018-07-05 17:32:05 One can not simply get their oil changed with out saying “no thank you, just a fucking oil change please” at least 5 times
4063 2018-07-05 17:32:04 Congratulations. 
4064 2018-07-05 17:31:53 So true and so gross. I know you do not cook but... Try making your own salad dressing and you will never buy the pre-made stuff ever again. Just mix equal parts acid with oil and adding any spices that you like. I recommend grated garlic. And Dijon mustard. Tada! Delish.
4065 2018-07-05 17:31:25 Haha  if I wax I always put olive oil on after so the stickiness and then when I shower after it’s not sticky
4066 2018-07-05 17:31:09 I hate customers that come in to do an oil change or service and then they have somewhere to be afterwards and yell at me because they’re late. It’s not my fault you can’t plan right.
4067 2018-07-05 17:31:01 $CL_F Oil will soon cost $100 per barrel due to supply disruptions caused by U.S. #PresidentDonaldTrump, Iran’s #OPEC Governor told #Reuters
4068 2018-07-05 17:30:57 he wants cheap oil to keep the economy growing, the less money we spend on gas the more we do on travel.  strong gas demand keeps ethanol pumping, the last thing ag needs is for ethanol demand to slow,
4069 2018-07-05 17:30:47 We went through the oil crisis. We survived.
We went through the Thatcher economic medicine. We thrived
We went through the ERM debacle. We avoided the Euro
We went through the financial crisis. The bankers survived
We can get through #BrExit. We will thrive outside the EU

4072 2018-07-05 17:30:46 Saudis tell OPEC that June oil output jumped by about 500,000 barrels a day. At least temporary relief for #StockMarket

4075 2018-07-05 17:30:38 You only put oil when you're trying to roast tomatoes (so when the fire is on the high setting). Here you're on low. You can add water if it seems a bit dry, but fresh tomatoes usually are juicy enough, so you may not need it.
4076 2018-07-05 17:30:35 Oil changed, fresh cut, I'm lit lol
4077 2018-07-05 17:30:25 In week 4 I'm going to try switching the hot sauce from a Louisiana style to an Eastern chili garlic sauce and stir-frying the whole thing in chili sesame oil.
4078 2018-07-05 17:30:24 @SoulOBrass Wanna change "Wolf of Wall Street" a bit. At the million dollar range the wolkskin does become a huge wolf but it can also generate oil using the valuables it's absorbed as fuel. At the billions it becomes a giant mass of shifting oil
4079 2018-07-05 17:30:09 I always say that I’m going to start using sunscreen as I put on tanning oil with SPF 4 IN IT.. like yay for being tan, but I need some aloe asap
4080 2018-07-05 17:30:09 The sad truth of the matter is we can't. The Liberal party used climate change to get votes, then once in power, it did whatever the oil industry told them to do. While we can't compete with big oil dollars, we do have a say in our own lives
4081 2018-07-05 17:30:04 I’m freaking out. Who has a viable explanation for Republican, not Democrat, (since they were rejected by Russia) Senators going to Russia to meet with oligarchs? Russia has only oil and an economy the size of Italy. WTH is going on? Any reports or threads?
4082 2018-07-05 17:30:03 Electric cars have an impact on oil. A few small companies like Tesla, BMW and Nissan have sold a few.
4083 2018-07-05 17:29:58 I need to go take Angie (my car) for an oil change before she’s cussing me out on the side of the road

4091 2018-07-05 17:28:42 I always forget what an ordeal getting an oil change and tires can be. 
4092 2018-07-05 17:28:37 Why is he still there? Oh right, works for oil companies- the real leaders of our country! #RenewableEnergy now!
4093 2018-07-05 17:28:36 There's nothing better than dipping fresh, still half warm bread in high quality olive oil. Your husband needs to wise up!

Remind me to send you a pic later this week of the highest quality olive oil there is. Going on vacation to my grandparents in Greece tomorrow.
4094 2018-07-05 17:28:17 Start drilling here! We have all we need beneath our feet. We don’t need their oil and gas!
4095 2018-07-05 17:28:13 Thank you my darling. My hair loves coconut oil, it’s my go to moisturizer.
4096 2018-07-05 17:28:03 Lightly fried in olive oil and served with a spicy relish -Harissa is good......
4097 2018-07-05 17:27:54 You ain’t said nothing slick to a can of oil
4098 2018-07-05 17:27:27 The way some girls like guys with cars, you
will think they were breastfed with engine
oil...
4099 2018-07-05 17:27:23 Getting an oil change at Jiffy Lube VS. getting an oil change at the Car Dealership which is better ?
4100 2018-07-05 17:27:23 It is time to dump oil companies and go to clean renewable energy. Trump is only looking after his oil cronies.  Your winter whitehouse in Palm Beach will be underwater due to your global warming policies.
4101 2018-07-05 17:27:15 Does the  not have its own oil reserves? Why the F you need the Arabs?
4102 2018-07-05 17:27:11 It's not possible to impose tough sanctions on companies and governments that take oil.
4103 2018-07-05 17:27:09 Welcome!

IIRC in my edition (I have the second ed at home) they think 'extract' in ¶2 may mean something like an excise tax - it otherwise doesn't make much sense to talk about 'oil extract'.  Checking the CAD may help.
4104 2018-07-05 17:27:02 Alberta: price of crude less than cost of extracting oil from oil sands > logic for bringing oil out ? Answer I got : «  because it is there »
4105 2018-07-05 17:27:00 Smell of tea tree oil acc makes me gag, I’ve been using tooth paste too and it works !!! Did u acc take urs out ???
4106 2018-07-05 17:26:56 Why can’t the US use it’s own oil and gas. It seems the prices could be lower for US.
4107 2018-07-05 17:26:52 I’m rey ask the plug @KushFruit if she make “leave me alone” cus oil niggas been flocking in the worst way this summer

4110 2018-07-05 17:26:34 How would it be something were greatest at when there is little to no push back to their exploitation? Create it and then let it die?
Even under the last Dem Administration the National Parks had been exploited by oil & gas & ranchers....
4111 2018-07-05 17:26:30 @kennysim Hello, Can you please make public your views on Kinder Morgan's pipeline expansion and increased oil tanker traffic. I need info like this to decide on my vote.
4112 2018-07-05 17:26:18 Skittles bad for your health. Health-wise, they are not very different from eating several teaspoons of sugar in one go. Skittles are 75% sugar by mass, and contain several artificial flavors and colors. The other 25% starch and hydrogenated oil does not have anything redeeming

4116 2018-07-05 17:26:00 With re: Indy tho, the financial case for Scotland post-Indy, in the Eu or much closer to it than Brexit UK is getting more positive every day. Brexit will be a disaster for UK but there’s still time for Scotland to escape the worst. Oil isn’t everything. Tourism, whisky etc
4117 2018-07-05 17:25:55 There's always Venezeula's oil....

4128 2018-07-05 17:25:00 New Ontario premier cancelled carbon tax so we’d see a reduction in prices at the pumps. Then gas in #ygk went from $1.239 on Tuesday to $1.399 on Wednesday. When you say “government for the people”, @fordnation, which people are you talking about? The oil company people?
4129 2018-07-05 17:24:54 do i put marula oil on before serum or after? do i even need to use marula oil? @caveofbeauty @LaBeautyologist  help

4132 2018-07-05 17:24:49 Oil change and tire rotation and let’s see how much money they will get for other services
4133 2018-07-05 17:24:45 Coconut oil and lavender oil! Mix and apply! its amazing! A little greasy, but amazing
4134 2018-07-05 17:24:37 it gets greasy cause u wash it every day! ur stripping the natural oil so the oil glands make more to compensate
4135 2018-07-05 17:24:35 It's an interesting thought. I've begun to notice how some science festivals concentrate around oil money too.... Why does oil money do this? Is it a type of green-washing? A way of looking progressive?
4136 2018-07-05 17:24:27 Africa is a giant continent and not all countries have oil.
4137 2018-07-05 17:24:20 初TRPG超楽しかった！！感謝感謝
4138 2018-07-05 17:24:13 Because there couldn't possibly be consequences to disrupting the activities of a country that produces 5% of the world's oil on prices 
4139 2018-07-05 17:24:12 I’m not in California. I am free to collect all the rainwater I want. I know a guy who rebuilt a motor that ran on beggie oil, not much of a fisher, but here that isn’t enforced much. I don’t even have to buy a permit for my handgun
4140 2018-07-05 17:24:07 I feel like you didn't use all of your character count and could have added a few more "HA"s
4141 2018-07-05 17:24:04 bio oil ,,,,,,, thank u
4142 2018-07-05 17:24:04 The US government is there is So much oil there. Somalia has more oil than UAE, 7th on earth and people take droplets of it only. That’s trillions of dollars. No wonder they want to be there.
4143 2018-07-05 17:23:55 Unlike the Left, I can love Trump and still think the giant baby Trump is funny as hell. Life is a tradegy for those feel and comedy for those who think.
4144 2018-07-05 17:23:35 And I don't believe the Wests main reason for pulverising those countries is for oil or other resources. Yes they are stealing them but I believe there's a darker side as to why they are continually making those regions destabilized.
4145 2018-07-05 17:23:22 Then why is he flapping about oil to the Saudi’s????  He wants cheap commodities.  If he didn’t then he could fix this real easy. Take ethanol to E30 and make more diesel from soybeans.  Uses less oil and uses more of our commodities then we don’t need China!!!!
4146 2018-07-05 17:23:08 You can do hair masks once a week and it helps hair growth. I usually do an egg mask and coconut oil. Drink plenty of water. Dying your hair stunts its growth. Make sure you trim your dead ends. Prenatal vitamins and biotin are good.
4147 2018-07-05 17:23:06 Radio DJ mentioned how much CBD oil helped her dog with the firework anxiety.
4148 2018-07-05 17:22:48 I think DJT’s talk of wanting lower oil prices is mostly fake. He wants some followers to believe he “feels their pain”, but he’s really on the side of big oil and Russia and they want higher prices. IMHO
4149 2018-07-05 17:22:35 Yep, that's the end of the pipeline. They never get repaired, just bleed oil and gas all over the place, forever.
4150 2018-07-05 17:22:27 western + big oil greed is killing eastern canadians

4152 2018-07-05 17:22:26 UPS Air Cargo has moved automobiles, oversized medical equipment, oversized oil industry equipment and stage equipment on the 747-8F aircraft.
4153 2018-07-05 17:22:22 If you talking bout the glittery look with the shimmer oil that’s easy to make at home. Put the make up powder you use for your highlights in baby oil (not too much) , shake and tadaaa 
4154 2018-07-05 17:22:19 I'm like 90% sure one of my neighbors poured olive oil into their laundry just now and I'm???
4155 2018-07-05 17:22:11 So you’re feeling the pain, aren’t you? The fracking strategy is over, less oil reserves are being discovered and an increasing demand works on existing ones. Stop the sanctions on Venezuela! The OPEC is a sovereign organization and won’t obey your orders! #N3305jul

4159 2018-07-05 17:21:57 Sustainable energy is a national security issue, not steel imports. Most military funding has been and is spent defending oil companies profits. This has to stop. We need to declare war on fossil fuels.

4163 2018-07-05 17:21:31 MCT oil is like Gatorade or those sugar goo packs in my mind. Zero nutrition and  people think it gives them “energy”
4164 2018-07-05 17:21:25 If I recall they reduced the oil price last week isn’t it? 
4165 2018-07-05 17:21:25 The Middle East crisis has been around for a long time and mostly down to the British and German rush for oil after fall of Ottoman empire, but present crisis was directly caused by illegal and immoral Iraq invasion. It is reasonable to be sceptical.
4166 2018-07-05 17:21:24 Grow until you forgot what your real face looks like.

4175 2018-07-05 17:20:30 Oil trading chatroom update #OOTT : Seems to be some bullish frustration among the nano time frame traders today. Some traders blaming FOMC talk for near term slowdown of price action today.  No one has called another person in the chatroom a "retail" trader yet. A good sign.
4176 2018-07-05 17:20:11 White people yes Lmaoo but black, no!! I oiled up Berta the other day with regular coco oil with the help of the sun she was glistening

4182 2018-07-05 17:19:55 I definitely should have made plans or invited someone to come with me while I wait for my car to get it’s oil changed
4183 2018-07-05 17:19:45 You said it's Trump's fault; we're talking the facts of the OIL market. If you have ever encountered Economics 101 and met the Supply and Demand curve, removing any supply raises prices...but that's elite stuff, I don't fault your lack of understanding of the subject.
4184 2018-07-05 17:19:42 Those bastards sold it at half price to a Gupta oil company
4185 2018-07-05 17:19:42 I need a oil change and my nails done 
4186 2018-07-05 17:19:19 You work in oil and gas no wonder your kissing Trump and Putin’s asses.
4187 2018-07-05 17:19:13 Odd question but you can deffo taste the difference in higher quality olive oil right?
4188 2018-07-05 17:19:09 Absolutely. And your tough stance on Iran is divorcing to Saudi. They must increase oil production to pick up slack. They can’t have it both ways, or we pull out of Syria.
4189 2018-07-05 17:19:07 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
4190 2018-07-05 17:18:53 This whole time i thought it was some type of special oil 
4191 2018-07-05 17:18:34 Things you do not shout out loud that are out of context.

4193 2018-07-05 17:18:17 After i scoop out the excess oil, descend on the food, na made in China naim be the only thing wey dem go see
4194 2018-07-05 17:18:16 @HRDMinistry Honble Sir kindly make CBSE schools 5 days/week and reduce syllabus. Children getting bouts of depression at an age to play, laugh, learn & evolve. 5days would give time for activity, reduce burden on oil and traffic. @PrakashJavdekar
4195 2018-07-05 17:18:14 It’s difficult to feel at home when you never know which olive oil you’re allowed to use.
4196 2018-07-05 17:18:03 @PowerLunch please #Trump created the oil price increase cuz he personally eliminated the Iranian Agreement

4198 2018-07-05 17:17:57 So you are basically a handful of people giving your time for free, always on TV, who all just happen to want to privatise the NHS and Brexit for cheaper Olive Oil and bananas? 

Truly admirable.
4199 2018-07-05 17:17:57 USA should stay out of Venezuela or it’s going to end up with more refugees on our doorstep.  USA is sending poor soldiers to die for oil not our freedom.  USA government is a puppet for our energy companies.  Obviously sad#Venezuela
4200 2018-07-05 17:17:47 Yes lmao I swear all I gotta do is put on any lotion and I’m gliding like grease  my skin oily. But coconut oil (the butter one they use for cooking) works perfect!

4203 2018-07-05 17:17:33 Trump diplomacy has mad all our friends uneasy—uncertainty drive up the price of oil— gas costs more—you are screwed..

Wait for it— the debacle is coming!
4204 2018-07-05 17:16:55 I think it takes five weeks to see the effect, it's the time it takes the oil to transit from Canada. #OOTT
4205 2018-07-05 17:16:53 Those who would give up essential Lymph, to purchase a little temporary Fedora, deserve neither Pastel de nata nor Chili oil.
4206 2018-07-05 17:16:52 Cut your pelepele small, cut onlon, put little oil in the pot, fry onlon, put that pelepele let it cook until softer, pour a small amount of vinegar and salt, stir well
4207 2018-07-05 17:16:33 You started a trade war, pulled out of a deal with Iran (an oil producer) while calling for new trade restrictions on Iran. You piss off our allies while conspiring with Russia.
This is on you.
4208 2018-07-05 17:16:33 Been thinkin that for years now!
4209 2018-07-05 17:16:19 Pods for a fast tan? Whatever happened to using good ol' baby oil?

4214 2018-07-05 17:16:03 Oh yeah. What’s his energy policy again?  Oh yeah: “OPEC, PUMP MORE OIL”. Great policy kiddo
4215 2018-07-05 17:16:01 I will not wait a hour in a half for a oil change
4216 2018-07-05 17:16:00 Solar is getting cheaper and more efficient every day while coal and oil prices increase. It’s only a matter of time before solar becomes the obvious choice for consumers.
4217 2018-07-05 17:15:58 In pursuance of its determination to remain globally competitive, @NNPCgroup will be embarking on gradual transition from an integrated oil and gas company to an energy company.- @DrMKBaru
4218 2018-07-05 17:15:47 Big prayers up.
This just a suggestion but I’ve read some studies where CBD oil have shown a decrease in seizures from occurring but I’d prob recommend that :)
4219 2018-07-05 17:15:33 Then u should be banning tanker traffic through there too! What's the difference between BC and the east coast. Oh yeah that's where u get your foreign oil from. I guess foreign oil won't pollute the oceans if spilt!
4220 2018-07-05 17:15:26 Has that happened in Norway? Denmark? Sweden? Switzerland? No it hasn't.

Further, the unrest in Venezuela is due to US sanctions & loss of oil revenue when the price was artificially lowered. Their situation was caused deliberately by the US and allies so they can point & scream
4221 2018-07-05 17:15:22 Verdict is mostly in...

- Driveshaft is bad, needs pulled and eventually replaced.
- Catalytic converter is going bad, needs replaced soon
- Potential oil leak from somewhere
- new tires (on order)
- alignment
- oil change

And that's about it....

4224 2018-07-05 17:15:09 old cooking oil contains free radicals.
4225 2018-07-05 17:15:05 What is it with the two biggest destroyers of the environment (animal agriculture & oil & gas) using @Marvel characters to promote their products. 
Do they really think we can be so easily fooled?
4226 2018-07-05 17:15:01 The oil many people pour into their cooking gets me jittery. 
How can one be drinking oil in the name of eating a meal?
4227 2018-07-05 17:15:00 My olive oil is not extra virgin, but that doesn't mean I'm going to slut-shame it. #vegetablekindness #olivefeminism
4228 2018-07-05 17:14:58 Iran OPEC Gov: sees above $100/bbl oil prices to come; 
Pres Trump would be one to blame. Trump is hostage to Saudi and Russian oil policies which don't bring oil price down

4230 2018-07-05 17:14:42 I put too much coconut oil on my hair.
4231 2018-07-05 17:14:40 Big oil will not be happy until they ring out the last dollar from the last drop of fossil fuel ..the environment is secondary ... I thought our PM was onside ...carbon tax for what again?
4232 2018-07-05 17:14:39 WTI oil at $74.43/barrel, +$0.29.
4233 2018-07-05 17:14:38 @JeepCareUK hi can you help what oil can I use in my 2017 renegade 1.6 petrol?
4234 2018-07-05 17:14:22 last week I had a terrifying chat a former environmental supervisor for an oil refinery. She told me how her boss would wait till she was away to dump toxic waste on the river, out of lazyness, since setting up the filter took only ten minutes. The villains are real.
4235 2018-07-05 17:14:21 Orgasmic???
4236 2018-07-05 17:14:17 @realDonaldTrump to make oil prices go down, force their hand by making a push toward alternative fuels.  Everyone listens when they start losing money.
4237 2018-07-05 17:14:17 Gas prices have been fluctuating since 2001,  Under Obama they went up drastically also.  We have learned not to panic as they change and adjust when they go higher.  The only reason your gas is almost $4 is because of taxes not because of oil.  Ours is stable at 2.60
4238 2018-07-05 17:14:12 They have oil. A couple of days ago he demanded that the Saudis produce more oil because Venezuela was unreliable right now. Pure coincidence, obviously.
4239 2018-07-05 17:14:03 It's like they don't know the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf.
4240 2018-07-05 17:13:50 welcooome, ngayon ko lang naalala na coconut oil helps in hair growth ahah
4241 2018-07-05 17:13:42 Cypress essential oil. Difuse and put it directly on your stomach with a carrier oil
4242 2018-07-05 17:13:37 Applying virgin coconut oil to your stretch marks each day might take away some of their redness.
4243 2018-07-05 17:13:22 Any newly developed snake oil he's offering to sell now to help fight?
4244 2018-07-05 17:12:58 Yes. Energy sector. But not the oil industry. That’s part of the past. And since USA is 2 biggest polluter in the world, it means it’s the second responsible for the current climate state. Take responsibility.
4245 2018-07-05 17:12:53 EXACTLY. Just a couple of days ago, Trump demanded that the Saudis produce more oil because Venezuela is unreliable right now. Pure coincidence, obviously.
4246 2018-07-05 17:12:49 It's better than pussy hats, I guess.
4247 2018-07-05 17:12:46 What kind of sun tan lotion/oil you ladies use when y’all be looking like shiny snacks on the beach ?
4248 2018-07-05 17:12:36 Whats really sad is that je's opened up the coast line for oil rigs. (Excluding the one in FL)
4249 2018-07-05 17:12:30 Little olive oil and a little garlic salt or lemon pepper, and roast it in the oven. Pretty good IMO.

4251 2018-07-05 17:12:23 Because in the end oil still pays very high for entry level, you can’t earn the same in the IT industry for entry level,
4252 2018-07-05 17:12:12 BERNIE, coal, oil and gas create A lot more job than solar or wind could ever create.  Coal, oil and gas are also more reliable and cheaper.  Your argument is just plain silly.
4253 2018-07-05 17:12:07 Africa is an oil exporter, we do not have to trade for it on the international market, we can produce and consume our own oil. Thanks
4254 2018-07-05 17:12:04 no one told me that so not eating it but right now probably like sweat and coconut oil

4261 2018-07-05 17:11:04 Do these people even realize how absolutely ridiculous they appear to those who, at one time, may have been fence-sitters?  I have long been an Independent but I would have to think long & hard before EVER voting for a Democrat again.  #idiots
4262 2018-07-05 17:11:04 Americans need to Twitter President Trump to be pro solar. Electric cars. Get away from coal and oil. It’s a matter of life and death. Economic it’s smart. Repost this everyone. Lets go Jetson style
4263 2018-07-05 17:11:03 If food service in KY paid oil rig money I'd drop out of college and flip burgers for the next 10 years.
4264 2018-07-05 17:11:01 Republicans say anything that has fed subsidies can't be successful. No, there's subsidies because solar is too Damn high. Thxs to dt tariffs that cost has risen. When r we ever going 2 learn Republicants=big oil/gas/fossil fuels/no epa corporation's best bud
4265 2018-07-05 17:10:54 Yes, after 1973 mayhem with choppy 6 month trends after the oil crisis and leading into the 74-75 bear market. A great traders’ market if they could pick the non-trending moves!
The key element was of course rising inflation rates.

4268 2018-07-05 17:10:42 There are fans/bloggers desperate to show they are better & smarter than anyone else.  They’ve fallen into trap of being against anything Oil to be in position to say they’re smarter than real hockey mgt.
4269 2018-07-05 17:10:35 Anyone want to replace my water pump and change oil for a barter on a free full detail?
4270 2018-07-05 17:10:34 Deep it in oil
4271 2018-07-05 17:10:26 I know water based foundations can separate super easily with oil underneath them, silicone probably does similar. So my first guess would be maybe switching your moisturizer/some tea tree to balance your oil production?
4272 2018-07-05 17:10:22 It’s all fun and games until the coconut oil hits the frying pan and fills the room with an aroma that will make you regret every decision you’ve ever made. Health is dumb.
4273 2018-07-05 17:10:21 What's the point of having Nissan Priority if it's going to take 4 hours to change my oil when it literally takes no more than 25 mins anywhere else.
4274 2018-07-05 17:10:20 And how pray tell are you going to trade for oil on the international market if you don't have dollars?
4275 2018-07-05 17:10:18 “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.” Psalm 23:5 (KJV)
4276 2018-07-05 17:10:18 Okay that was a joke about Trumps immigration comment but they have oil so forget I brought it up okay?

4279 2018-07-05 17:09:47 Japan and U.S war was over oil, oil is America's most precious interest be prepared to face the full force of the U.S if you cross it.
4280 2018-07-05 17:09:43 Pres. Trump call other countries to stop buying crude oil from Iran and putting European companies under pressure with Nigeria and Libya being crisis-stricken, Venezuela’s crude oil output having plunged and Saudi Arabia’s consumption increasing...
4281 2018-07-05 17:09:41 Right on!!
4282 2018-07-05 17:09:40 All these painters and artists. Good work but what is Oil on Canvas. I see it everywhere,
4283 2018-07-05 17:09:37 #IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari: If #Iran is not able to export its crude oil through the Strait of #Hormuz, no other country would be able to do so.
4284 2018-07-05 17:09:22 I found another holy grail skin care ,,, TEA TREE OIL BITCHES . I use to ignore it cos I usually let my pimples heal themselves but bitchhhhhh it works like a charm
4285 2018-07-05 17:09:19 So today, I’m going to try some beard oil and see if it lives up to the hype.
4286 2018-07-05 17:09:15 Why is bread and olive oil so good WHY
4287 2018-07-05 17:09:12 Any infrastructured system has lower continuation costs than starting over. But if solar and oil both had to start from zero tech infrastructure, gas would win b/c it's easier to extract large amounts of energy, useable at will, with oil.
4288 2018-07-05 17:08:46 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
4289 2018-07-05 17:08:38 Oil price rises blamed again! Why don't energy prices drop when the oil price drops then???
4290 2018-07-05 17:08:22 That paper is causing a bigger mess than it already is itself, given its contradictory message.
Well, fortunately coconut oil is not seen as a health food on either side of the debate (wfpb/primal), by most reasonable people. Basically just empty calories, like any other oil.
4291 2018-07-05 17:08:21 This has nothing to do with Iran and Oil and War, why do I care about Trump's personal life nor do I give a shit about him being the president as I am not a citizen of the U.S and a citizen of Australia.

You need to vent your anti trump on another thread, this isn't it
4292 2018-07-05 17:08:01 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
4293 2018-07-05 17:07:50 i meant them all. people want to believe & there's plenty o snake oil for them. a so-called enlightened teacher recently told a friend that if she couldn't come up w $5000 for "massive results" then she was coming from "lack" & he couldn't help. then he blocked her. nice huh?
4294 2018-07-05 17:07:50 #USDCAD looking for a nice bounce back to 1.3200/50 area if FOMC min come out strong and due to oil falling. Then looking to go back down to 1.30.
4295 2018-07-05 17:07:42 We didn't need so much imported oil when Obama was President.  We wouldn't need it now if we could repurpose all the ass-kissing Trump Republican lickspittles into a power source.  #hoboheretic  Enjoy.

4303 2018-07-05 17:06:40 All IRGC has to do is plant mines in the narrow making it dangerous for oil vessels to pass through. Mine sweeping isn't an easy task. Iran may not close the straits but the message to Washington is clear: stop messing with Iran.
4304 2018-07-05 17:06:33 I want to sell my car, just so I don’t have to go get oil changes, and getting aggressively flirted with every time I’m here. Let me just sit in my car, and be.

4311 2018-07-05 17:05:50 You made fun of PM Modi when there the oil company dropped only 1 paise of fuel price . Now your government in Karnataka has hiked the fuel price by more than a rupee,,why are you silent? Only a dumb like you will call the budget of Karnataka a beacon for farmers. Poor Pappuji.
4312 2018-07-05 17:05:44 Seems to me, the majority of trouble same cause as Syria. Outsiders funding their fav team in hopes of oil revenue. Assad may not be dead, but he's just another team captain now. EU/Rus/NA govs open door policy to corporate colonialism and distribute arms like candy.
4313 2018-07-05 17:05:43 well if they take your money and you try to grow some personal for yourself becuz you cannot afford the oil or dried flowers? Ask me what happens next?  and why I do what I do?
4314 2018-07-05 17:05:40 Does that mean I don't need to put water or oil? Sorry for sounding stupid 
I usually don't cook, this was a menu in our canteen awhile back and it really tastes good.

4319 2018-07-05 17:04:58 Lmao just when you don’t  think CBC can stoop any lower. Notley is the epitome of the enemy when it comes to pipelines. A known activist that’s still opposing pipelines. Every single person she has on this are anti oil activists. What about this is difficult to understand.
4320 2018-07-05 17:04:47 Francisco: do you believe oil prices by themselves could allow Venezuela to recover production, and also considering weak supply from Libya/Canada?
4321 2018-07-05 17:04:31 The way owerri girls like guys with cars, you will think they were breastfed with engine oil

4323 2018-07-05 17:04:28 Two questions first, are you wearing a primer, and what kind if so? And do you know if your foundation is water, silicone, or oil based?
4324 2018-07-05 17:04:17 I also wonder if our very own SASOL’s coal-to-synthetic fuel production couldn’t be increased from the 150k barrel per days to meet an even higher demand by SAns (assuming a litre of fuel from the CTL technology is cheaper than fuel from imported oil).
4325 2018-07-05 17:04:10 Iran says Obama gave 2500 iranians citizenship liberals lose their shit on fake news.  Iran says price of Oil is up because of Trumps tweet, liberals:  Yey Iran is right.

4328 2018-07-05 17:03:57 Utah, for example, is not equipped to manage that land.  The state would either sell or lease it (100 year renewable leases) to private parties, and most likely oil/mining.  
I'm a libertarian, but there have to be some massive changes and steps taken before any transfer.
4329 2018-07-05 17:03:56 I would suggest YouTube if you don’t get some help. Just search that and go to one of the most viewed oil changes. They have some good tutorials

4335 2018-07-05 17:02:54 Butter has some nutrients, but in pretty small amounts, meaning you’d have to eat a LOT of it to get meaningful nutrients from it. For ppl seeking to shed fat, no need to eat a bunch of butter or MCT oil
4336 2018-07-05 17:02:52 in the past they have sold their oil above the Brent price so if history is good guide then they are selling well beyond $80 
4337 2018-07-05 17:02:50 Estimated 440,000 jobs lost during the collapse of crude from 150 down to 35/40. 150,000 of those are will never come back even at crude over $80.

4357 2018-07-05 17:00:35 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

4372 2018-07-05 16:59:32 The country's oil production is remaining at the record high of 10.9 million barrels a day that was set early last month, while crude exports declined from the new record of 3 million barrels a day set two weeks ago down to more than 2.3 million barrels daily. #oott

4375 2018-07-05 16:59:23 I really hope the choice to not run the AC in Lucas Oil Stadium and thus probably pushing potential attendees to the game isn't a weird ploy to use to try and convince the city/state that's why the team needs their own stadium.
4376 2018-07-05 16:59:14 I understand all that. I'm only saying that there appears to be no reduction in oil by rail planned, so it's not a fair pro-pipe argument. It could/should in theory reduce train use, but until that's guaranteed, it's not a fair place to go. You have better arguments.
4377 2018-07-05 16:59:13 I was hoping my man would help with my oil change today
4378 2018-07-05 16:59:05 Not to mention Susie that Israel has ended up with access to 77% of Iraq oil production.Through all of the Mideast Proxy Wars that America has participated, Israel benefited.Hopefully Americans will wake up to these inequalities & speak up!

@Sara59703838 , it was a law firm that handle contracts for oil wells owners and a lot of their clients had oil in Africa. I  left and stayed with Lene until the guy, stopped.

4386 2018-07-05 16:57:56 Sorry my mistake.

"There's still no comment from UKOG & Europa O&G who are merely hydrologicaly pumping liquid acid into drilled oil wells in order to fracture rock.

Which is totally different from hydrologic fracturing which they're not legally permitted to do."
4387 2018-07-05 16:57:56 The United States' record production has plateaued for now, in part because of pipeline bottlenecks in West Texas' booming Permian Basin. Most pipelines are filled to capacity, and more companies are resorting to transporting oil via trucks. #oott

4391 2018-07-05 16:57:20 Thanks Sir for telling the truth. I saw that our spokesmen are not highlighting and stressing on this point? Where is Chidambram and Rahul now who used to tell that we will reduce rate of oil by 25%? Who is stopping them in doing so in Karnataka?
4392 2018-07-05 16:57:18 just a thought experiment: if oil companies had to start over, they would not be competitive with solar.

4402 2018-07-05 16:56:28 So, what part of your political/social/cultural/ agenda does your agent not like?  For many, the gap is so wide as to interfere with their lifestyle mindset.  Like oil and water don’t mix; light and darkness.

4448 2018-07-05 16:52:00 We gave our little dogs & cat cbd oil yesterday, too. They were still scared but they weren’t inconsolable like they usually are.
4449 2018-07-05 16:51:46 Hooooy nabasag ko yung eficacent oil na isang bote, my life flashed before my eyes! Haha ang sakit sa ilong ng amoy ng kwarto namin natuyo na lahat ng sipon ko. 
4450 2018-07-05 16:51:46 get him to take action on the high sugar, chemical crap in cancer 'build up' drinks please!- eg. Ensure, Fortisip, Complan etc. I have no doubt this contributes to poorer outcomes, especially when you also consider the poor quality protein and vegetable oil.
4451 2018-07-05 16:51:45 Donald is interested more in the oil industry now. Yesterday he demanded that the industry change it's rates and lower the price! The high gas prices make him look bad!! It sounds like donny has already moved on!

Today you saw about petrol price hike in Karnataka and reminded to Rahul Gandhi about his speech on crude oil petrol price increase.
But what about FDI and GST that one day Narendra Modi opposed before becoming PM.Did you remind to PM and peopl abt that spech?

4459 2018-07-05 16:51:08 Not til supply equals demand. I see price rises over the next couple of years. In 10 years time it will be cheaper than olive oil.

4464 2018-07-05 16:50:23 The oil market has been supported by a fall in output from Venezuela and the potential for a halt of Iranian oil exports due to U.S. sanctions. #oott
4465 2018-07-05 16:50:11 Not so lib dems could use the preamble comment regarding perfect union to be, analogous to forming a perfect union between a Jack Ass and a Buffalo (genetically) or perhaps water and oil. It is not the Articles of our Constitution but in its preamble. Imbecilic but atypical.

Brief flurry of Forex people 30 min ago demanding tips.  Some old grudges are being brought up between posters.  Could get ugly.
4469 2018-07-05 16:49:48 My parents woke everyone up out of a dead sleep last night at 4am to pray and wipe oil on our foreheads... i almost lost my damn mind 
4470 2018-07-05 16:49:45 Shipping problems already put plenty of books and board games in the red - without new tariff disputes getting worse and oil speculation making transport more expensive. I’m worried for the projects I’ve backed that won’t be able to wrap up production by the end of the year.
4471 2018-07-05 16:49:43 Oil-by-rail is more expensive, has a higher GHG profile and more risk so oil-by-rail will decrease when that volume is being moved via pipelines. 

I have never said the risk stays the same, I have consistently pointed to the analyses that show that oil-by-rail is riskier
4472 2018-07-05 16:49:20 I couldn't figure it out for the life of me why they'd do this but then somebody threw out the idea that they were oil heavy states... Russia being a petrostate...
I still don't see why spending the 4th there was a good idea.

4477 2018-07-05 16:48:50 Well okay then, let's end oil depletion allowances, farm subsidies, and so forth. 
Also, above all, let's end cherry picking of which tax breaks conservatives are indignant over.

4480 2018-07-05 16:48:41 well put. The technological iliteract behind big oil is staggering- they don't even know about hemp plastics, so they keep mining toxic crude to do things hemp could do (i.e. Motive's Kestrel). Hemp can literally do everything fossil fuels can do, plus a lot more...
4481 2018-07-05 16:48:37 Just cut up bacon, cut up cabbage, Cook the bacon a little before tossing in the cabbage with a tiny bit of olive oil and seasonings(I used garlic salt, cayenne pepper powder, and pepper).
4482 2018-07-05 16:48:30 We must be energy independent. We were until after WW2 when we decided to control the middle east oil reserves to keep it out of the hands of the Soviets. Now, it's keeping out of hands of the coming Caliphate of the 12th. Mahdi that's is paramount.

4484 2018-07-05 16:48:24 CNBC@HalftimeReport is there any small oil companies that would be a good starter like Falcon energy hurricane energy, ukog. At the moment I'm with hurricane energy but looking for somewhere to put 50k on I can see you're still worth going for. What do you think
4485 2018-07-05 16:48:19 So… I found out today how the #ESO Chimer skin is such a pretty gold color.  It’s because they rubbed Boethiah’s POOP on themselves.  OHHH HELL NOOOO…  God or no God, poop is not touching my skin! I’ll stick to baby oil and sun for that golden tan.  @TESOnline

4490 2018-07-05 16:47:57 Oil producing nations like higher prices. To lower prices Russia will have to glut the market with oil. That would hurt them as well as the other oil rich nations.
4491 2018-07-05 16:47:57 Not only don't we rely on oil money but our oil rich owners have been investing their money so that they will still have huge income when the oil is gone.

4500 2018-07-05 16:46:26 I can’t do anything about those country’s oil consumption. All I can do it choose what I buy in the UK. There is no need for a UK based snack food company to add to palm oil demand by using it in UK produced snacks.

It's definitely something we all to work on globally and I hope I haven't come across as disrespectful, it just isn't my priority. If oreos remove their palm oil I will be very pleased! :)
4509 2018-07-05 16:45:22 well, it seems Iran indirectly or maybe delibrately supports the USA finantially! because The USA will charge the Arab countries to protect their oil tranfer to the world ! Its a suspicious activity between Iran and The USA !
4510 2018-07-05 16:45:16 USA key benefits to date is 1/ oil supply 2/massive gold and fiat global reserve 3/ Military  . 19th and early 20th century was golden years for USA because EVERYONE worked hard and willingly to suffer for chance at prosperity . That’s what’s missing today in this country .
4511 2018-07-05 16:45:10 IT is the oil of the 21st century & Africa is the mining field. If they trip for oil companies, they should consider tripping for a more important oil field. 
An average oil company cannot employ more than their offices capacity. We have officeless people making big money in IT.

4513 2018-07-05 16:44:47 I thought you said that the Saudi guy agreed to make more oil?
4514 2018-07-05 16:44:44 as for "the oil industry is on its knees" I think you're reading old newspapers, current price Brent Crude just under $78 
you say it's getting more expensive to extract, all this does is increase the end price as oil becomes shorter in supply
you do know we're big on renewables?
4515 2018-07-05 16:44:44 playing it so smartly good cop bad cop which people don’t realise right now. Trump actually want to keep oil prices up, fear premium is one which market always gives. That happend for 5 years before the crash again trump wants it. Helping Russia and Saudi w/o coming to notice.

4519 2018-07-05 16:44:27 I've just learned there is another Canadian journalist Paul Wells, @JWN_Paul. Other Paul Wells writes primarily on oil issues, making his name much more delightfully suited to his profession than @InklessPW.
4520 2018-07-05 16:44:26 What mechanical extrusion can an automobile gives without oil or  speed when petrol is lacking? Finance and capacity building remain the greatest obstacles facing Africa entrepreneur. Funding programmes like Youwin etc in Nigeria will go a long way in helping the youths .

4522 2018-07-05 16:43:54 But that's misleading. Apples to oranges. Combustion takes energy from gas directly.  EV needs it converted to electricity before it uses it at 85% efficiency.  How efficient is the electric company that uses mainly oil and coal?
4523 2018-07-05 16:43:44 Not peace prize material. Trump's itching to fight with everybody. For someone who didn't want to police the world, He's awfully busy trying to punish everyone who "mean" to the USA. And. Trump doesn't care about the people of Venezuela, he cares about the country's oil.
4524 2018-07-05 16:43:37 Take four garlic pills or cut up two garlic seeds and take them. Tea tree oil on the outer ear for the inflammation and a tea made of oregano for your headache 
4525 2018-07-05 16:43:29 Plus there are brands out there that make the same sandwich cookie and specifically avoid the use of palm oil for that reason. The same way we buy garedin instead of regular meat. I don't see the issue in people not giving oreos their money lolol
4526 2018-07-05 16:43:18 Bhakts aur bakwaasiyon ko kya poochna... We are getting screwed because of this cm... What if international crude rate for oil increases...

4528 2018-07-05 16:43:00 And when a tanker spills, the slick will be evidence to send the crew and oil executives to jail?  I thought you had balanced reason.
4529 2018-07-05 16:42:55 I'm going home. Hot. Dusty. Tired. And somebody just called to tell me he'd been charged, and paid, £349 to a garage for changing an oil pressure sensor seal. "He was very good with me..." I bet he was. I'm surprised he didn't offer a quick handjob.

4530 2018-07-05 16:42:53 And saying that people won't be able to eat their favourite biscuits anymore because they contain an oil from a tree that when farmed can harm orangutans is what makes veganism seem so extreme to the general population, it makes people think 'well what can I eat?'
4531 2018-07-05 16:42:50 Top of the faculty, Jamaican did that in engineering, yes we have good engineers in Jamrock not because we don't have oil and shit. Remember this Jamaicans run the world.

4533 2018-07-05 16:42:45 Funny the democrats support the killing of 2000 babies a day but yet you support them? The big downer money comes from drug companies and oil that affect every one in the USA how about working on those three things and leave my guns alone that affect nobody!
4534 2018-07-05 16:42:34 Sorry, but socialism does work. Sweden, Norway, Finland, & many other European countries are socialist democracies & are some of the most economically viable countries in the developed world. Venezuela was socialist, but they made a fatal mistake in only relying on their oil.
4535 2018-07-05 16:42:33 It's possible I'm getting ready to step in front of a train, but shorting crude oil at $77-$80 is going to be too hard to pass up. $uso $sco $drip #CrudeOil #TimeWillTell

4537 2018-07-05 16:42:28 Another #reasonilovethesouth is that it's so hot that my coconut oil is already melted before I even start cooking 
4538 2018-07-05 16:42:25 Coconut oil > Lotion
4539 2018-07-05 16:42:19 Try this argument next time you bring it up: a few quarts of oil and new filters is way cheaper than a new Tahoe.
4540 2018-07-05 16:42:14 He's actually telling the American People what is going on behind closed doors and obviously not expecting his tweets to change oil output. You leftists are daft
4541 2018-07-05 16:42:12 The issues that palm oil brings are mostly very similar to the wider animal agriculture industry, just to a lesser extent. As vegans we should be trying to make veganism as accessible as possible.
4542 2018-07-05 16:42:11 The US found that "Indian lands are estimated to contain up to 13
per cent of the nation's coal reserves, 3 per cent of its oil
and gas, and significant amounts of other minerals in- cluding uranium and phosphate." and created puppet Indian governments to be able to get these

4547 2018-07-05 16:41:23 We have rich resources of gas and oil right here in the USA. Texas , Califirnia, Alaska, and Louisiana lead in their production. Need to stop using it from over there. One largest refinery is in Texas City, Tx. Why we buying overseas

4558 2018-07-05 16:40:19 Wish they could have hedged WTI-LLS basis when it ramped but don’t think there is a market to do so. 

Huge bump in production as much the story as oil.
4559 2018-07-05 16:40:17 it's not something Scotland would have to rely on, I'm fed up pointing out that oil is (literally) the cherry on the cake of Scotland's economy, you want to argue about the size of a cherry when the cake is an ample one, sufficient to feed us all
Scotland's economy is healthy

4561 2018-07-05 16:40:11 This is more compelling a must to get into sugar-ethanol fuel blend given the skyrocketing fuel prices based on reliance to OPEC oil or even local distortions perhaps!
4562 2018-07-05 16:40:08 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
4563 2018-07-05 16:39:53 And here's the important Saudi oil figure - before #OPEC had agreed the increase on June 22 -  "the sources added that the total amount of oil Saudi Arabia supplied to the market in June was around 10.579 million bpd - so up almost 600,000 month-on-month!

4569 2018-07-05 16:38:58 This means ceasing the direct exploitation of animals for food, cosmetics, clothing and entertainment. Now, is palm oil a big problem? Certainly. Is this single-issue campaign against palm oil making people overlook other very negative industries? I think so.

4575 2018-07-05 16:38:00 This is one of the places your argument suffers though, no? You and others have said oil by rail will not stop pipeline or no pipeline. This risk stays the same and shouldn't be used as a pro or con. I still think we need a televised debate/discussion on km...
4576 2018-07-05 16:37:48 Skin type w itu oily acne prone dan rada sensitif juga sih
Biore cleansing oil menurut gw bagus karena gampang dipake, cuman lo pump terus usap2 ke muka terus bilas. Praktis, dia bisa angkat make up lo mau make up berat kayak foundie dll sampe yg waterproof juga bisa ilang
4577 2018-07-05 16:37:45 Agreed. I have a strong personal to immediately apologize if I erred, and never to apologize if I have not.

Apologies are the oil in the gears of civil society. Of course, one has to have the capacity for self reflection...

4582 2018-07-05 16:36:56 Hey Kevin, the recipe's been relatively the same. In 2014, the Gnarlic had Salami. Today, the salami's been removed and we have a new garlic oil recipe.
4583 2018-07-05 16:36:50 I use cold pressed, organic, virgin coconut oil. You can eat it plain, moisturize with it or use it for cooking. Generally in a solid form. It melts with a touch of heat. I also use it as a makeup remover and it's a great oil for popping popcorn!
4584 2018-07-05 16:36:49 That single bottle of avocado oil used up half of California's clean water through the year 2020 we r NOT giving up 
4585 2018-07-05 16:36:46 If the past 4 decades of governments hasn't squandered the heritage fund instead of realistically taxing Albertans to cover their expenses then the downturn of oil prices wouldn't have been so disastrous. Just a thought.
4586 2018-07-05 16:36:46 Spare me. The oil industry is on its knees, we needed to have done that from the start Not now that the oil is comparatively expensive to find & extract. I’m surrounded by the devastation the oil downturn has caused. It’s an unreliable funding source.
4587 2018-07-05 16:36:31 What the hell does Donald have to do with this? U.S has fought wars for Oil before Trump this has everything to do with oil and zero to do with Trump. Get a grip

4595 2018-07-05 16:35:39 Weird. I'm guessing they're proposing drilling in foothills and/or nearby valleys.

I worked at Bald Mtn mine at south end of the range a while back and we had access to cuttings from a couple oil holes drilled in the valley to the east.
4596 2018-07-05 16:35:36 A life of insanity. Considering how much oil RI sucks up annually. Liberal absurdity at its best!

4602 2018-07-05 16:34:52 "testing levels that have never been seen before", AKA price shocking. Oldest trick in the book. Price of oil, (world market), is much lower than it was 10 years ago yet gas prices are outpacing inflation. Supply chain issue, from OPEC to the end user. We need green alternatives
4603 2018-07-05 16:34:36 Keep those coal and oil trains running along the coast in South Surrey White Rock. Surprised the Greens think this acceptable
4604 2018-07-05 16:34:36 Seems to me that-EVENTUALLY -pipelines will and must be built to convey the oil from point a to point b.Maybe a long time to accomplish YES.

4620 2018-07-05 16:33:37 the SNP are no less Central Belt-centric than Westminster is London-Centric. Aberdeen has funded Scotland for 30 yrs with oil money at the expense of many non-oil staff residents & it feels like it’s been given nothing when we need an economic boost.

Dude: "No big deal but you need two new front tires! Have a nice day!!!" 

Me: "That's no big deal in your book? It was going pretty steady till you relayed that news to me." 

I should really work on my people skills.

4638 2018-07-05 16:31:40 It’s not a tax because it’s not going into the government’s wallet. It’s similar to the oil royalty in Alaska, where govt just adminsters the funds to citizens.
4639 2018-07-05 16:31:38 Who knew getting your oil changed could land you car in the shop for almost 2 weeks

4703 2018-07-05 16:26:06 Toxic ones, my parent's were the same, I left home at 16 but was relieved when they broke up. Like oil and vinegar and I bet they're the same - Those poor kids!
4704 2018-07-05 16:25:55 Roflmao. The telegram you speak of. Is a telegram suggesting an alliance between Mexico and Germany. That in fact didn't come to be. In fact Mexico remained neutral. In fact supplied oil to the British during ww1. Please do some fact checking.
4705 2018-07-05 16:25:55 EFF are so naive. Do they have any idea how a world economy works. About exchange rates and emerging markets and fluctuations in the supply and demand of oil...  NOT helped by a corrupt governing party of course... but there a bigger picture

4707 2018-07-05 16:25:39 Oil food ah 
4708 2018-07-05 16:25:38 Best way of doing that is surely to not use palm oil? We’ve survived in the UK until now without it. We don’t need it.
4709 2018-07-05 16:25:37 the price influence metrics for btc futures work in ta similar way to how commodities contracts futures work - i.e. paper gold and oil contracts.

the asset itself isnt traded, but the fiat-based paper contracts are used to control and manipulate price.

4714 2018-07-05 16:24:56 Including a specious $500k from the gov't of Venezuela. Which begs the question of why does @realDonaldTrump  keep asking about a military invasion on Venezuela? Oil is the answer. God help the average people of that besieged country.

4736 2018-07-05 16:22:57 and the only winners were the oil companies and weapons
4737 2018-07-05 16:22:50 I think I’ll invest in this gun oil I keep hearing about
4738 2018-07-05 16:22:48 With Trump driving up oil prices, they can afford it

4741 2018-07-05 16:22:37 I wore pants yesterday and regretted it by the 5th hole.
4742 2018-07-05 16:22:30 Two most powerful economy country hitting 3rd like football. 1 hitting by prescribing where to buy crude oil, other telling what Air India should call Taipe. Are we republic or Bananarepublic.

4745 2018-07-05 16:22:04 I hate when I’m waiting for my oil change and people who get here after me, leave first.. makes me a little mad. Then I ask if my car is ready... and it has been.... aren’t they suppose to let us know?

4747 2018-07-05 16:21:56 Really need to get some hair oil tonight
4748 2018-07-05 16:21:43 Crude oil was expected to show a significant draw down of 8-10Mb but instead showed a 1.2Mb build.
4749 2018-07-05 16:21:42 Has it occurred to anyone that if bought oil stocks after he got prices to drop.  Then tweets to drive the oil up.  Then sold his stock he and his friends would make a lot of money.
4750 2018-07-05 16:21:30 The data today was moderately bearish and crude oil prices are now down nearly $1/b to US$73/b for WTI.
4751 2018-07-05 16:21:27 Worst it’s been for 10 years apparently and it’s not going to let up  for a while!  I’ve been using the vapour oil from @breazeallergy its great a few drops on a tissue and it’s instant when you smell it.  The motion activated pillowcase is great for during the night!

4753 2018-07-05 16:21:13 LMao fruit=seed 

also if interested, cooking w Cooknut oil is healthier than most other cooking oils... 

If you don’t mind coconut flavor
4754 2018-07-05 16:20:58 Also coconut oil, which is about 2/3rds MCT, has been shown to decrease LDL and increase HDL (Clinical Biochemistry, vol 37, issue 9, Sep 2004, pg 830-835). I'm just saying, the data is mixed on benefit. Too early to come down hard on either side of the issue.
4755 2018-07-05 16:20:53 those who govern the destiny of mexico are the same behind the united state government, the oil and arms companies, for that reason during the last century they financed dictators, coups and guerrillas to destabilize the Latin American region, causing millions of deaths and
4756 2018-07-05 16:20:52 Don't compare the airline industry with the oil industry. They are not the same.
The oil industry, apart from regulations is not closely dependent on government. 
Most important, Nigerian Airways is no longer a drain on the government.
4757 2018-07-05 16:20:43 Agreed, but they could be just like Texas. They have one of the biggest oil reserves in the world. Too bad they have jacked up leadership, or lack there of.

4760 2018-07-05 16:20:11 About 40yrs ago OPEC had said oil will run out, yet technology has changed and gas economy has improved yet we still have oil. I ask what has changed in other places to continue this monopoly.

4766 2018-07-05 16:19:33 Tell that to @theJagmeetSingh .  He wants to do away with Canadian oil all together.
4767 2018-07-05 16:19:20 The ‘owners’ of the oil are raising prices. Isn’t that what owners do? MAGA #trump
4768 2018-07-05 16:19:19 Oil, oil, oil! He’s a tyrant that if allowed, would invade or stage a coup to get the oil. Remember his campaign stmt that the US should’ve taken Iraq’s oil to reimburse us for invading their country and killing 500K for nonexistent WMDs and  by falsely conflating them with 9/11.

4774 2018-07-05 16:18:53 I am just a dumb old oil trader but that image looks like one I was supposed to describe when given a psychometric test by a former employer.  I said it looked like an "evil clown" and they hired me on the spot. #OOTT
4775 2018-07-05 16:18:52 It’s the worst it’s been for 10 years! Apparently it’s going to worse next year!! I’ve been using the vapour oil from @breazeallergy its really helped me this summer.  Hope you find something that helps!
4776 2018-07-05 16:18:45 Just negotiated my home heating oil price for next winter. Gee, Prez Asshat thanks so much for more than a buck a gallon increase! And did I thank you for limiting my NYS income tax and property tax  to $10,000? Oh and I forgot about the 10% I’ve lost in the stock market in 2018!
4777 2018-07-05 16:18:39 Germany et al,. are land-locked countries. They need the oil?

4779 2018-07-05 16:18:13 It’s only temporary.  The bubble will burst soon.  The price of oil regresses to its mean just like all commodities.

Why is it that those would be critics of Fed

This is not hard folks. Continuing down this fossil fuel road & the longer we take to change course, the sooner we reach the point of no return.

War is iminent.

4791 2018-07-05 16:17:00 If you think stopping the supply of global oil is only going to involve JUST the USA that would be a Yuge mistake.......

4799 2018-07-05 16:16:30 Hahaha co. And people said yi fish oil with drink o'pop then my friends and I mixed it. It didn't quite look the same
4800 2018-07-05 16:16:21 Oh, and now might be a good time to increase domestic oil production back online. Cutting oil exports from our country would also help increase supply.
4801 2018-07-05 16:16:17 Switch your fish oil for krill oil 
4802 2018-07-05 16:15:59 OPEC is a cartel, not a monopoly. The US isn't a member, choosing to pursue its own objectives. Venezuela, however, was a founding member and produces a very significant amount of oil. You just stated that you “wouldn’t rule out a military option” there; is there a connection?
4803 2018-07-05 16:15:53 Does anyone actually purchase anything from Canada other than oil and timber?

4811 2018-07-05 16:15:18 That’s very true .. they brain washed innocent people and convince them to go to useless wars by paying them top dollar . In fact , they send them to protect the Washington devils interests not to defend this country . BLOOD for OIL... shame on them

4817 2018-07-05 16:14:47 the best part of cooking with coconut oil in the warmer months is that it's already pre melted for you
4818 2018-07-05 16:14:46 btw personally I didn't get the BB oil but I looked for the ingredients and found something similar from DrManuka (which is mainly marula oil) and got that one instead
4819 2018-07-05 16:14:38 Do your research. Under Obama, oil prices cane down. Prices have been increasing under Trump. Good for Russia. Puts pressure on sanctions to open up Russian oil to USA. #PutinsPuppet
4820 2018-07-05 16:14:38 It's why we need to become independent of oil & until then we need to give the Left and drill for our oil

4838 2018-07-05 16:13:01 the answer to climate change has always been nuclear. specifically, thermal spectrum fission in a molten salt (gen 4) reactor. big oil hates this. nuclear can power the planet until the sun goes red giant.

4845 2018-07-05 16:12:37 I just loved how the media in the US described Diana’s brother as Earl Spencer, as though his given name was Earl, like some guy from Queens in a bowling shirt, who’s wife pronounces it “oil.”
4846 2018-07-05 16:12:36 Lock em up!  Funny Notley never stands up to protestors and vigorously opposes illegal activity publically; She was against the oil industry before accidentally getting voted in, and will always be so. Thanks for taking a stand Jason! Alberts needs your leadership! #kenney2019!

4848 2018-07-05 16:12:36 There exists a small device that can power your home and auto for free ... forever ... but ... if it hit the market right now, what would happen? How many Countries and people depend on oil for a living ... on coal ... on electricity ... How many unemployed? Slowly. But will come
4849 2018-07-05 16:12:30 This is our money we’re talking about. Not Trudeau’s. It’s Money which could be used to actually improve our lives. Not our money going into Big Oil pockets.
4850 2018-07-05 16:12:30 Does that mean we will change our national bird from a bald eagle to an oil soaked duck? I think it would be only appropriate.
4851 2018-07-05 16:12:26 When other countries fear the US is at risk for default, they sell debt and purchase other currencies to hedge reserve currency risk. Imagine oil starts being priced in the yuan. China wouldn’t have to fire a single bullet to burry the US economically.

4863 2018-07-05 16:11:14 There was a study showing arsenic in formula. It has also been shown to be in breast milk & tap water.

4876 2018-07-05 16:09:42 Yes I think the oil companies are gouging us, but most of the cost of a liter of gas is tax, which Horgan just increased. Does he not grasp this?
4877 2018-07-05 16:09:38 Yes, in the Philippines, they will use them for petty crime like drug use, much less economic treason like obstructing our resources.
Why don't these people go and protest in Qatar if they don't like unethically produced oil? Oh wait...

4884 2018-07-05 16:09:03 Should a person who’s protesting petrol strive to use less? Sure, I’ll grant you that, I’m sure they do to some degree. To expect them to be able to expel all oil based products however... well.. I said why in my first response. ;)
4885 2018-07-05 16:09:00 If US closes the air (oil) on Iran, Tehran will react by closing it on everybody within their area. Yes I believe Iran will. It was done during the Iran-Iraq war.
4886 2018-07-05 16:08:57 If a group wants to "keep remaining oil, natural gas & coal in the  ground" while using said natural resources products & benefiting  from the modern economy & democracy that depends on them, they will  be called out as the lying hypocrites they are.
4887 2018-07-05 16:08:56 Dear Mother:  Patchuli oil supplies are being rationed. Birkenstock’s are a blessing in this heat. I saw a red hat man crying gluten free tears.  Hoping to be home before Christmas (I know mom a 2 front war is hard on all of us).  #Secondcivalwarletters @TheRickWilson
4888 2018-07-05 16:08:55 Ugh, I love tea tree oil. It seriously helped clear my skin up!! I need to get back on that.
4889 2018-07-05 16:08:50 Weird. Are they broken? Maybe you need to take them in for a tune up or an oil change or filter cleaning or something. 
4890 2018-07-05 16:08:48 Yes!!! Turn up the heat on those traitorous goons. The #RussianPropaganda on their visit has just been nauseating and with Putey filling up the Oligarch bank accounts with oil profits ($75/barrel) and toothless sanctions to boot - We know what they're up to!
4891 2018-07-05 16:08:45 Omg when you say '95 it only feels like 3 years ago.  WTF. Anyway, thanks again. As of next Friday I won't have anymore & my dose is already crazy low. I still don't like it but it'd be worse getting off them later. The oil is awesome! I can make it though work totally fine

4893 2018-07-05 16:08:37 Hope your feeling better! I’ve been using the vapour oil from @breazeallergy its been a lifesaver this summer!
4894 2018-07-05 16:08:36 It is all about the law of supply and demand. Iranian oil being taken off the market reduces supply and raises cost. Who in your cabinet didn't explain to you this would happen? Might want to figure out the Strait of Hormuz next!

4900 2018-07-05 16:08:05 Alternatively, by investing strongly in nuclear, producing low cost energy, you might use the market to compete against/reduce big oil?

4904 2018-07-05 16:07:45 Yes red hot planet. This why your government’s enabling of higher emissions by becoming a heavy oil pipeline owner is so completely baffling. Perhaps you are not as committed to this issue as you like to portray...
4905 2018-07-05 16:07:44 The best way to handle this?
Whenever oil crosses $50,
US charges more from these OPEC countries for the military support provided. Scale the charges on slabs: 60$,70$,80$...
Bring a bill:
"Trump OPEC defense accountability bill"

4914 2018-07-05 16:06:54 People who insist that oil should be transported by rail only, should be reminded of this horrific disaster.
4915 2018-07-05 16:06:53 Except it never goes down commensurately when oil is down. They cap refinery quotas to keep gas prices high, or at least that’s what we’re told.

To help you get more veg in your diet try swapping chips for Butternut squash cut in to chips or carrots of various colours to make rainbow fries . Part boil the veg for about 10 mins then roast on a high heat with a little oil to crisp up.

You are omitting quite a bit of history, wrt Iran
Iran is ruled by the Mullahs bc 1953 CIA & MI6 deposed the western leaning, democratically elected Mussadeq.
& installed the shah Reza Palewi.
.
That was about the oil too.

4932 2018-07-05 16:05:49 Why are they trying to stop a oil filled tanker from leaving? The longer they are in our water the longer the chance they have to spill it.
4933 2018-07-05 16:05:46 We could have been using a lot less if big oil was not lobbying against alternative energy.
4934 2018-07-05 16:05:45 I'm specifically referring to our American system which was & still is built on the suffering of others. Also Rockefeller is not some wonderful golden child, he had so many immoral business practices, like secretly buying out oil related businesses to then give himself rebates.

4968 2018-07-05 16:01:13 nothing, just like every other attack on "protesters". ie calling them "paid" and "jobless" and "tree-huggers" etc. weak attacks from the oil lobby and their minions because they have nothing

4970 2018-07-05 16:00:43 Hence oil should be bought in local currency at least from Iran

4973 2018-07-05 16:00:27 Thank goodness for Pinterest- it makes getting your oil changed bearable
4974 2018-07-05 16:00:26 Yup - used to do demand modelling. I used to get into quite serious rows (for an oil analyst) about why we were assuming ever more growth on plastics demand and very particularly for light ends as feedstock.
4975 2018-07-05 16:00:26 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4976 2018-07-05 16:00:26 Two more Brits were infected with the nerve agent, but, you know, Russian oil money for the politicians is just so great.

4982 2018-07-05 15:59:41 All I can think of is helping Russia exporting oil while hinder our production. The only one I don't know about is WI - all the others our big oil/natural gas states. Lived in WY and in between beef, oil rigs & fracking which was $$$. I really don't know but everything is oil.

4984 2018-07-05 15:59:34 2/2 An oil deal with Russia has been a plan all along. Obama quashed the Exxon/Russia deal when Putin invaded Crimea. Tillerson was supposed to get it back. Congress sanctions stopped it. Cancelling Iran deal was a step toward it. Why do u think Perry met w/ Russia’s energy Dir.?

4992 2018-07-05 15:59:06 You didn’t need to, and you should be in jail for treason. Also you idiots aren’t lowering the global oil usage, if your campaign works it lets unethical oil with less environmental controls get more of the market share. Enjoy those foreign big oil paychecks tho

4994 2018-07-05 15:58:45 He's effectively taken much of Iran's oil off the market, increasing demand.  Then he tweets blaming OPEC (classic defection).  Then he says Saudi will produce more to get the price down, and his base think he's a hero again.  And yes, Russia benefits...a lot....

5009 2018-07-05 15:56:31 Just so you know, I think CBD oil is a little bit magic...will definitely continue to take it past these current problems I'm having [also...not a single headache...not one!]

1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil and gas or the 8% scots get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I look forward to your replies

5043 2018-07-05 15:53:45 Castor oil or activated charcoal with water if you can get your hands on it. It sounds kinda gross but the best way to get rid of food poisoning is to literally shit it all out lol
5044 2018-07-05 15:53:45 All of which is helping  oil producers by making fracking cost effective. This helps create jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign oil. You are literally asking OPEC to make our trade deficit worse and cost American jobs. Can't have it both ways.

And then take it off as soon as it is light brown. It goes from white to brown very quickly if you don't watch.

5062 2018-07-05 15:52:41 This was the point I made yesterday. It’s nearly impossible to protest a system from the outside. Over the past 100 years our economy is centred around oil, now it’s in everything. Calling someone a hypocrite due to the world they were born in and trying to change is asinine

5064 2018-07-05 15:52:40 A majority of today’s ailments are caused by air pollution (coal, gas, chemicals,cars, industry), soil pollution ( Monsanto, pesticides, oil, herbicides, chemicals), water pollution (oil, chemicals, run-offs), processed foods , drugs ( can’t even spell any of the ingredients).
5065 2018-07-05 15:52:40 Even the headline doesn't bear out "moderate." Rouhani implicitly threatend world oil shipping routes.

5067 2018-07-05 15:52:24 Yes. It is energy efficiency. It's reducing almost to zero oil for generation. It is switching from oil to gas for heating. It is a bit of EVs and CNG vehicles at margins. And EVs are growing rapidly in US.

5090 2018-07-05 15:50:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5091 2018-07-05 15:49:51 Heard some scientists say something about a climate change thingy. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Just keep on making the oil executives rich and everything will be fine.
5092 2018-07-05 15:49:49 My experience with this is that you might be using too much shampoo, so your hair tries to overcompensate for the dryness by producing more oil than it should. What I do is use conditioner-shampoo-conditioner and every now and then I just use conditioner so it gets a break.

5103 2018-07-05 15:49:00 Meanwhile we’ll continue to move oil east by rail thanks to your policies which killed #energyeast #cdnpoli #abpoli
5104 2018-07-05 15:48:53  There's a story told about DK in the 70s during the oil crisis. To conserve petrol they banned cars one day a week. People still waited at the crossings. THERE ISN'T A CAR RUNNING IN THE WHOLE OF DENMARK. CROSS THE ROAD.

5108 2018-07-05 15:48:44 More over, how does any of that relate to the change from the gold standard to the oil standard and your belief that the SA economy is currently being suppressed by international trends, events or conspiricy while most other economies inc. African economies are expanding?
5109 2018-07-05 15:48:41 It's who and what you VOTED for right????  Be quiet, enjoy your dose of MAGA, hopefully it will at least supply you some oil first....
5110 2018-07-05 15:48:36 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

5112 2018-07-05 15:48:10 My cousin got really sick after drinking castor oil, that's when my aunt stopped forcing us to drink it. I still hate it even now, I can't stand the smell and taste of it.

5132 2018-07-05 15:46:34 Agreed.  We also don’t have time to dick around w Dems that pretend to be environmentally responsible and aware but push fracking worldwide and support big oil.

5142 2018-07-05 15:45:46 Gatau ya, tp coba ke bio oil deh
5143 2018-07-05 15:45:46 Who says the report is neutral to slightly bullish? 
A 1.24 mmb crude addition vs 5-yr avg draw of -3.93 mmb draw = +5.17 mmb > 5YA. 
There were gasoline, distillate, unfinished oil & propane-propylene adds. That's quite bearish IMO.
5-yr avg won't change b/c you don't like it.
5144 2018-07-05 15:45:40 Yay us! Thanks! I’m on Wellbutrin and non-script SAMe (which, interestingly, is an RX in Europe for depression.) The psychiatrist also prescribed Gabapentin for these early couple of weeks so I could finally get real, restorative sleep. And fish oil, which I already took.
5145 2018-07-05 15:45:26 It has all to do with the past and current wars on oil and gas. Pure geopolitics and a dying western hegemony.

5166 2018-07-05 15:43:43 Contrary to what the piece says, the sea level rise in 2100 may be closer to 7m or more, than 7 ft. 
But these suits are good, and only the beginning. 
The big oil companies are however not the only responsible. Everybody that uses electricity, or a car, contributes.

5168 2018-07-05 15:43:13 Duclair would be a steal not upshall, in my opinion. Duclair 12 years younger and can skate, with goal scoring potential, judging from his rookie year.  Could possibly have found Leon’s wind man cheap, exactly what oil need.
5169 2018-07-05 15:43:13 President setting our country up to be independent by making our own steel, mine coal, invest in alternative energy, & yes, drill for oil! For years Crooked politicians took bribes to prevent drilling so foreigners and themselves got rich America is BACK, dependent no more
5170 2018-07-05 15:43:08 This guy dead Ass told me he hasn’t changed his oil in 4 years ....ok I guess you’d rather pay for a new engine 
5171 2018-07-05 15:43:07 The swamp of career politicians do nothing to better USA! Shouting racism daily! But people elected a POTUS this time who will keep his word & who has already brought USA back its lost wealth.We're looking at using our own oil, steel, & coal. More jobs created than ever before!
5172 2018-07-05 15:43:04 All part of her master plan to stir up racial resentment based on her belief that oil is good and land protectors are "Native Supremacists". Her aim: monetize this hatred to the benefit of her 'political organization'. Despite years of trolling, her plan is failing spectacularly.
5173 2018-07-05 15:42:45 But there is a future 'for' a party that supported the cold-blooded murder of more than 120 000 Iraqi parents and children for oil? Who ignited the inferno in the Middle East that has engulfed the lives of angelic children in Syria? Caging about over 120 000 kids is ok for GOPer?
5174 2018-07-05 15:42:41 Let’s make cars that run off of used vegetable oil (grease) instead of gasoline which is running out 
5175 2018-07-05 15:42:35 So much controversy now with canola oil. Which oil is ever safe for human consumption?
5176 2018-07-05 15:42:33 Contrary to popular opinion,  not all South Carolinians are Republican. A vast number will be voting Dem in Nov at the coast over Trumps oil drilling.  Now the upstate might possibly follow suit over BMW et al. A large blue wave is headed for DC from SC come NOV. 
5177 2018-07-05 15:42:23 Israel is sowing.    Agriculture, technology, research and development, start ups, etc.    what are the Arab countries sowing?   What do they create?   Thank Allah for oil, without it, the Arabs offer the modern world absolutely nothing.   I mean nothing.   It's pathetic.
5178 2018-07-05 15:42:22 Trust me. This week's US crude oil inventory build (+1.2-million bbl) is a head fake. High runs and high exports will lead to a new streak of moderate to large inventory decreases through summer.
5179 2018-07-05 15:42:12 He's freaking about the price of fuel/ oil. That one hits everyone, could even affect us down here too...a little.
Fuel cost affects transport of food and goods, etc. Scary all around.
Its gonna hurt the people, tho. And that sucks. He's an idiot. The people are his boss.

US crude oil inventories grew by 1.25 mln barrels in the week through Jun 29. Following this news, WTI crude dropped over $1.00 and now trades around $73.20
5184 2018-07-05 15:41:22 Economics 101. The price of oil is set on the free market. OPEC controls the rate of production of it's member states. Try opening a book that doesn't have your name on it.
5185 2018-07-05 15:41:22 Do you need any oil to lubricate the bot joints?

5190 2018-07-05 15:40:45 It does no such thing. It shows no guarantee of increased fuels. It implies the possibility of a minor increase but also the possibility of continued constraint of fuels in favour of heavy oil. 

And I certainly wouldn't trust the word of KM without a binding agreement.

5199 2018-07-05 15:40:26 There is no fracking in the Surrey area but there is conventional oil extraction at Balcombe & conventional well testing prepared (possibly ongoing) at Horse Hill. So definitely not caused by fracking.

5212 2018-07-05 15:39:24 I’m sure the price of oil has nothing to do with how jittery he’s making investors with his trade war talk.
5213 2018-07-05 15:39:16 You do understand that:
1) OPEC isn't a monopoly.  (We produce oil too)
2) If they were a monopoly,  they have no incentive to lower prices

5214 2018-07-05 15:39:15 Okay, you got me. There's a water-powered car but Big Oil is covering it up. They also held a gun to the head of Bowen Islanders and forced them to live in a sprawled, ferry-dependent community. Nothing is our fault.

5233 2018-07-05 15:37:16 Absolutely. So much published on available "helps" (like MCT oil) for entering ketosis, but these are "leavers" that should be abandoned (or at least reduced) once nutritional or (in my case) therapeutic ketosis is achieved. MCT oil is not food.

5235 2018-07-05 15:37:02 Oil, oil, oil! He’s a tyrant that if allowed, would invade or stage a coup to get the oil. Remember his campaign stmt that the US should’ve taken Iraq’s oil to reimburse us for invading their country and killing 500K for nonexistent WMDs and  by falsely conflating them with 9/11.
5236 2018-07-05 15:37:01 It's not fracking as nobody is fracking in the area. There is some oil exploration which is at least prepared at Horse Hill & conventional extraction at Balcombe. So it's not fracking which is causing these quakes.
5237 2018-07-05 15:36:59 Nice build! Last weeks exports were radiculous, still high but more palatable this week!

5241 2018-07-05 15:36:43 @realDonaldTrump So how are your plans to invade Venezuela? Did you also think about invading other countries with huge oil reservations, such as Brazil? Do you believe in a country's national sovereignty?

5255 2018-07-05 15:35:25 Child. Let me find a man that wants to give me coins in exchange for pics of my feet. Do you know how quick I’d oil these thangs up?!?
5256 2018-07-05 15:35:24 I'm afraid we differ on the notion that selling oil is not a good way to make money. I also don't subscribe to the notion that oil companies are uniformly to blame for our petroleum addiction. It's a comforting thought, but not backed up by the facts.

And finally they are NOT fracking; these wells utilise conventional methods.

At kalyan bhiwadi junction, there is regular traffic jam for hours together, resulting in waste of time & precious oil. This is due to bad road condition. No action is taken for last one year. Kind intervention is prayed for.

5315 2018-07-05 15:30:30 This is exactly the reason why many car manufacturers are including “free” maintenance with their vehicles.  By taking away the excuse for why not to get an oil change, they reduce the amount of warranty work they end up with.

5335 2018-07-05 15:29:35 Putin has a critical longterm economic problem that a quick oil price increase won’t fix. Their petroleum industry infrastructure is old & failing. They’ve extracted the easy oil & needed the sanctioned $500B+ Exxon/Rosneft Arctic Sea deal to get to the massive offshore oil.

Why are you also ignoring the business fact that there's no real business case for this pipeline?

Meanwhile salaries are growing 2% a year as Obama left to Trump and gas prices grew almost 50%. Wait till November till first heating bill, and you know who to vote for
5342 2018-07-05 15:29:03 Prices are a function of demand and supply. The one who draws the oil wants the highest possible price. The one who buys it can regulate it if it's smart enough.

5557 2018-07-05 15:11:08 Dunno why this reasoning suggests a case for across-the-board price cut. Wouldn't it make more sense to ask for a sweetheart deal on oil prices for that special country providing defense "for very little $s"?

5650 2018-07-05 15:04:21 Oh man, I had a hard time with that too, so sorry she is in pain!! Tylenol is baby safe, but ibuprofen is not (according to my OB’s rules). I also used peppermint oil on my temples and the back of my neck. It helped a lot!!

5654 2018-07-05 15:04:10 Mine too! But since i use coconut+castor oil and vaseline to grow them they are longer and a bit more abundant, mascara makes them look very nice!! You can also curl them without needing mascara.
5655 2018-07-05 15:04:09 I may not be your cup of tea, but I certainly measure up to your required daily dosage of fish oil supplements.

5657 2018-07-05 15:03:56 From external threats, yes. And we'd obviously come to their defense like we did in the Persian Gulf War if something popped up simply because of the oil issue. I'm talking more about the internal battles that seem to be emerging between those who would modernize 1/2
5658 2018-07-05 15:03:55 Yes! I use either a serum or face oil or a leave in mask

5661 2018-07-05 15:03:44 Saudi Arabia ramping up that much oil would leave the oil market dangerously low on spare capacity, At that point, any supply disruption would send oil prices skyrocketing. Significant volatility exists if spare capacity is less than 1 mb/d.

5785 2018-07-05 14:57:05 Make an avocado and witch hazel face mask. 

Avocado has vitamin E which is perfect for dry skin, and witch hazel gets rid of excess oil as well as impurities.
5786 2018-07-05 14:56:52 It's so easy to dispose of oil properly only a moron would do this. Any Advanced Auto will take the used oil free.
5787 2018-07-05 14:56:50 I travelled Texas for a month. Took photos of everything. The oil and gas industry is flourishing, but not because of Trump. They already were. The Permian Basin (area in West Texas) is probably the 4th largest oil field in the world. Gas pipelines are being built to Mexico.

5790 2018-07-05 14:56:37 Turkana's crude oil evacuation blockade is deeper than is being said (admitted). 

1. It is a fight over boundaries btn Turkana & west pokot.

2. It's fight over oil blocks territories.
 
3. It's a fight over oil revenues.

4. It's onset of resource curse.

5791 2018-07-05 14:56:28 They’ve managed to hide or buy silence with all and any technology that threatens oil for decades, it’s a disgrace.

5793 2018-07-05 14:56:08 And, yes, coal and oil are 'natural sources' - and humans are natural sources, too. Whoever said they aren't?
5794 2018-07-05 14:56:07 to be fair, it sounds like parents only take their children a multi-country human trafficking corridor plagued by rape and murder ~15% of the time

the other ~85% of the time, they *send* their children on that multi-country human trafficking corridor plagued by rape and murder
5795 2018-07-05 14:56:03 Reuters used to have an extreme anti-EV bias. for years. ended up editorial team had strong oil affiliations. on the plus side, it's been much better on EVs in past year or so, but still plenty of crappy/misleading stories as well.

Strawberries contain alpha-hydroxy acid, which sloughs off dead skin cells, and salicylic acid that gets rid of excess oil that cause breakouts.
5813 2018-07-05 14:54:45 True, but 2 points:
1) They are flat at a very high level such that NIIP still deteriorating.  If they were flat at a lower sustainable level that would be different.
2) manufactured imports still likely increasing.  Oil imports have fallen dramatically due to fracking boom.

5847 2018-07-05 14:51:39 Yeah. It's kind of snake oil, since that stuff won't improve our lives dramatically but they will be really expensive and take lots of time. There are much simpler solutions we could implement right now that would be far better.
5848 2018-07-05 14:51:38 You can only frack where there is coal or oil Alan - Never met a Surrey miner - Scotland was the fracking capital of the world from 1860 to 1962 and Grangemouth was the worlds biggest fracking refinery - hundreds of years of reserves left in Scotland

5853 2018-07-05 14:51:32 Trump's BS defined: OPEC is not a monopoly - they only produce 40% of the world's oil. The US buys about 18% of our oil from OPEC. And if it wasn't for your ridiculous violation of the treaty with Iran - prices would be 10-12 dollars lower per barrel.

5922 2018-07-05 14:45:09 No, he's allowed to have *that* opinion. He's not allowed to have the other one. Or something.
5923 2018-07-05 14:45:08 Fix what they are running from. You fix immigration and the drug problem at the same time. Yes there is no oil to steal like in Venezuela.  But stay out of Venezuela for they are more democratic than we are. Have a karma day
5924 2018-07-05 14:45:08 I need to be the one who puts the oil on Carrie's legs haha hope you had a great concert

5926 2018-07-05 14:45:07 This is what started the war between Japan and the US sanctions and oil embargos if this happens be sure that Iran will have a war. 

America turns it's back to everything when it does not damage it's interests this is damaging to the wellfare of the US expect hard response.
5927 2018-07-05 14:45:06 Getting my ride ready for this road trip... New tires, oil change, & some engine maintenance. Then gotta get my exhaust checked.
5928 2018-07-05 14:45:01 It's not so bad. I got a fair few tats now... don't think it's as bad as that. It's like getting splashed with hot oil from a frying pan. :)

5940 2018-07-05 14:44:20 The only reason I point at the Reps in this case is they really work very hard to support fossil fuel providers and get upset at any green subsidies. If we threw half the money at green power that we do oil, we'd be in a far better place. Oil doesn't need the money anyway.
5941 2018-07-05 14:44:16 DfT's first set of scenarios was based on differences in trip rates, income relationship (impact of change in income on propensity to drive), & macroeconomic factors (GDP, oil prices) - big variation in forecast motor traffic growth by 2040 (but lowest up 20% from now) #2018TPM

5943 2018-07-05 14:44:07 My family all still live in Telford so that's my 'bubble' burst I guess?

I sympathise with the need for change. But when that change was offered by clearly duplicitous right wing snake oil salesmen what exactly were they expecting?
5944 2018-07-05 14:44:07 Rising oil prices 
Increased cost of borrowing
Rising inflation
Increased healthcare costs

5945 2018-07-05 14:44:03 These POWs have thus far refused their rations of kombucha and crispy kale chips. They came perilously close to reaching our arsenal in the artisanal olive oil shop. We must be ever vigilant. #SecondCivilWarLetters
5946 2018-07-05 14:43:58 Tell me since you really believe that Trump is working for Putin: What kind of one sided deal is this? Trump is president. He expells ambassadors, drops more sanctions than Obama, crushes Russian oil through deregulation, bombs Putin's ally, breaks a deal with his other ally...

5949 2018-07-05 14:43:46 Except Calgary’s economy isn’t great.  Just sold a house for $400,000 less than what was offered 4 years ago.  Many oil execs can’t sell their houses and downtown looks like a ghost town compared to a few years ago. Albertans are strong,  but something has to change in 2019.

5954 2018-07-05 14:42:52 If Russia, Iran, China develop a 2nd, parallel oil mkt in non-USD, suddenly their power relative to US increases tremendously.  Saddam understood this; that is likely at least partly why he is no longer here.
5955 2018-07-05 14:42:42 To me the quintessential American story is the snake oil salesman or flim-flam man driven from town to town, moving on to his next patch of victims, protected by the law until he kills someone with enough money to sue him and win.
5956 2018-07-05 14:42:39 Since the cactus emoji is NOT copyrighted, anyone can use it.  It's the same as if no one but Texas could use the cowboy, or Oklahoma using the oil well.

I don't even use oil and it tastes great
5962 2018-07-05 14:42:23 What a fool you are--- how about trying to reduce our dependency on a product we can't provide enough of for ourselves.  Our military understands we can't continue to be reliant on oil-- shame you and your oil buddies don't get it

5972 2018-07-05 14:41:26 We tried CBD oil this year and it was amazing.
5973 2018-07-05 14:41:25 New hair product that I will be trying out. New ingredient. Flax seed gel. Well more than 1 new ingredient. Completely different than how I use to make it minus the coconut oil base. That’s still the same.
5974 2018-07-05 14:41:25 Much like coconut oil, I too appear to have a melting point of 76°. 
5975 2018-07-05 14:41:21 Do you prefer oil.... I sell that too 
5976 2018-07-05 14:41:15 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
5977 2018-07-05 14:41:08 Barrel refers to the price of a barrel of oil. It did go low in 2015 (although nowhere near as low as when Klein paid our budget off), but it is back up now.
5978 2018-07-05 14:41:08 Aaj in dono ke kuch special hisso mei Shri Kumaraswamy ji ne highly inflammable oil daal diya hai.
5979 2018-07-05 14:41:05 Correct.  So if a big oil exporter could help develop an oil mkt in a 2nd or even 3rd currency, would their economic & geopolitical power relative to the US increase or decrease?  The answer ofc is "increase".  This is at the core of much of the "Game of Thrones" we r watching.

5987 2018-07-05 14:40:20 Read the tweet. I never said I thought Edm is trying to acquire Karlsson. Once Karlsson is moved out of OTT, there's an opportunity to move salary to OTT to clear space so the Oil can sign Maroon.
5988 2018-07-05 14:40:18 Oil trading chatroom update #OOTT :  Genial group this morning, no ridiculing or challenges.  Forex types coming in more than usual demanding "buy or sell?" tips plus asking time of EIA report.  It is more than normal so something is up in the oil/currency correlation game today.

5990 2018-07-05 14:39:51 The cap is what the NDP placed on our oil and gas industry meaning we can only extract so many barrels of oil in Alberta per year. Once we hit that, we can't extract any more. So the big guys will extract that and there will be nothing left for the little guys.
5991 2018-07-05 14:39:46 Grandad literally doesn’t understand me unless I put on a bogger accent and say things like ‘spud’ instead of potato and pronounce ‘oil’ like ‘I’ll’

5994 2018-07-05 14:39:42 The shitlibs want us to believe it is the responsibility of the American Taxpayer to pick up the tab when the Risk/Reward paradigm fails. In reality, they just want the illegals here as dependents, to eventually vote democrat. Enlarge the plantation at all costs.

5996 2018-07-05 14:39:19 Agreed. I also never said higher ed should be free.  I just called an a**hole an a**hole, and I see there is another one on the horizon.
5997 2018-07-05 14:39:14 Thought the natgas report was today, but the EIA site says July 6th (Friday). Oil report still coming out at 11am ET.

6011 2018-07-05 14:37:40 Oil Tip of the Day

If the bottle says the oil is a fragrance oil, a perfume, or a synthetic, it is not an essential oil.
6012 2018-07-05 14:37:29 Gee, and I thought you said that you'd achieved agreement to lower oil prices. Lying again! And "played" again. So much for "The Art of the Deal"!

6027 2018-07-05 14:36:26 Unbelievable, now he is now attacking the very people that supply your oil / gas, maybe they will shut you off and you will have to return to rationing gas. And you republicans can blame it on the Democrats and OPEC countries. Just another example of the morons lack of education.

6043 2018-07-05 14:34:39 NOV 4th When Iran sells oil to China, Turkey & Europe? We go to war with Iran? I guess Israel is gonna take the hit for false evidence of WMD this time?

6052 2018-07-05 14:33:43 Sechin sanctions are not serious. He still continues to deal in oil with the Saudi's, US and others through intermediaries. His fortune is in Dollars Luke, not Yuan or Rubles. Slaps on the wrists for media/public consumption. Undermining him would lead to more aggressive Putin.
6053 2018-07-05 14:33:43 Yg namanya digoreng ya pake minyak atuh boleh kok... Aku saranin pake olive oil kalo gaada ya minyak goreng biasa tapi dikiiittt aja.
6054 2018-07-05 14:33:37 You need to keep blowing your dog whistle about immigration since you have totally screwed up on everything else.  Prices for oil and other imports are rising. You have alienated our G-7 partners.  Everyone is wondering about your strange attitudes toward Putin and Kim.
6055 2018-07-05 14:33:36 Do you honestly think that OPEC doesn't understand how oil pricing works?!
6056 2018-07-05 14:33:35 We just want to continue to improve our recipe, first we moved away from palm oil and now soya.. We hope our products will reach a wider audience now. For people with allergies etc too :)
6057 2018-07-05 14:33:26 Yeah, Don. Let’s start a trade war on oil too!   #FakePresident
6058 2018-07-05 14:33:25 We've had a mass exodus of oil companies since 2015 & it's because of the policies the NDP have implemented, not the price of a barrel. By imposing a cap they have essentially created a monopoly for the big oil companies that are left because there is no more room for anyone else
6059 2018-07-05 14:33:22 *whispers back* You can buy reading specs for less than the price of a paperback and then claim they are just for checking ingredient labels for palm oil.
6060 2018-07-05 14:33:06 I need to get my cleaned, seats shampooed, oil change, tune up & breaks  just everything before my baby come smh

6062 2018-07-05 14:33:02 My car needs an oil change, my credit card payment is due today, so much more & I have a 12 hr shift to work. Just need more time in my day
6063 2018-07-05 14:32:57 Oil companies get subsidized, Corn Farmers get tax payer $ to grow less to stabilize prices. But god forbid citizens should have social programs
6064 2018-07-05 14:32:47 I must look so sweaty sat on this bus, but I’ve just smothered myself in oil to catch a tan 
6065 2018-07-05 14:32:44 Yet he’s begging OPEC for more oil? You make no sense
6066 2018-07-05 14:32:40 New Jersey needs a gas tax holiday -- through Labor Day Weekend -- to cope with higher oil prices. Good for the Jersey Shore, good for small businesses, good for everyone who drives!

6078 2018-07-05 14:31:33 your criminal acts do not represent me, or most Canadians. Fringe groups thrive on activism, but are short on logic. Why do you not protest foreign oil, or US coal generation?
6079 2018-07-05 14:31:33 The most important OPEC member is KSA (3rd largest oil producer). Non Opec member is Russia (1st worldwide oil producer).... the 2nd largest oil producer is USA. So he should be talking to his buddies in US first (if they can.....)
6080 2018-07-05 14:31:24 It reminds me of spam.  There's a low response rate but there's enough idiots that click on the "growth pills" link to make the campaign worthwhile.  The only hope is to be wise enough to avoid the snake oil.

Vegan is not a diet at all, its an ethical stance against all animal cruelty

6090 2018-07-05 14:30:34 Trump the Insane first calls to boycott Iranian oil. This announcement raises the oil price. Now Trump begs OPEC to lower oil price. Does he really think the world is responsible for his own strategic faults? Trump makes OPEC great again MOGA

6100 2018-07-05 14:29:36 Bisa jadi oil cleanser buat bersihin muka apalagi kalo abis pake makeup tapi jangan didiemin lama2 krn bisa menyumbat pori.
6101 2018-07-05 14:29:28 I literally got some degular off brand almond oil and mango butter. Nothing specific. I'm too cheap for all that
6102 2018-07-05 14:29:22 Try working in an oil change shop, it’s about ten degrees hotter in the pit. Luckily I got a fan going today.
6103 2018-07-05 14:29:22 Alpha Arbutin kalo produk ini lebih ke masalah hyperpigmention, bisa ngurangin redness, bekas jerawat, dan mencerahkan wajah intinyaa. Kalo abis make ini kaya kulit wajah tuh kenceng gituuu, apalagi dipake buat skincare malem besok paginya wajah cerah glowy tapi tetep oil control

6105 2018-07-05 14:29:14 It's not quite drugstore but it's cheap enough that it might as well be--I LOVE the RCMA No Color Powder, it controls oil, bakes, and is actually translucent (just make sure to depot it into an easier to use container, it's in a literal generic plastic spice bottle).

6110 2018-07-05 14:28:24 HA! I know a lot of fire stations around here will fry your turkey for you if you'll just provide the oil and I think a small donation to a charity.
6111 2018-07-05 14:28:19 -the emissions, water, and waste created from refining oil into gas (another social ‘cost’ that no one wants to pay to remedy). The gas used to ship the gas in an oil tanker or boat to a gas station. The gas then used in the actual 4000+km trip north.
6112 2018-07-05 14:28:18 Shout out to the absolute dad lad that helped me get my engine oil cap off and then checked and filled my oil for me 
6113 2018-07-05 14:28:11 -the oil used to make the plastic container that municipalities will eventually need to pick up (also on a truck that also uses oil), recycle, burn, or transport for processing as waste if local facilities aren’t available, when we are done with it
6114 2018-07-05 14:28:03 @johnscharts Hi John.. can you give me your thoughts on Oil ? $DWT .. looks like a short ?

6117 2018-07-05 14:27:45 Saddam Hussein kept the ME stabilized. It’s why JFK and subsequent POTUSes tolerated his regime. We only turned on Iraq after Saddam said he was going to nationalize their oil, same reason we turned on Iran, same reason we’d turn on a dime on any of the other OPEC nations
6118 2018-07-05 14:27:31 Maybe us few British Columbians and the others aren't the idiots at all, maybe the people that think pipelining our Canadian oil out to be refined in the states and us buying it back from them at double the cost are the idiots, maybe we should have our very own refineries in can?
6119 2018-07-05 14:27:29 To stabilize world Oil Prices and protect OPEC from instability, there is one other strategy than "prices war." The #WhiteHouse needs to look at an alternative option: empower the #Iranianpeople. Can you not see the link?

6136 2018-07-05 14:25:47 You need to learn more about Venezuela.

70% of the Venezuelan economy is private enterprise.

Do you know that the shortages of products, are caused by corporations warehouse hoarding?

And that OPEC oil prices & US sanctions, that have caused most of their financial problems?

6151 2018-07-05 14:24:22 I think that the average people who pumps gas into a car has a better understanding of oil pricing than you do. When was the last time you filled up your gas tank?  Ever? The great businesses Amanda. Ha! Don't count on my vote in 2020. #TrumpBiggestLoser #2020Trump #XRepublican
6152 2018-07-05 14:24:20 Mr. President, we are exporting oil out of the country everyday. We finally have oil pricing that is bringing domestic production to record highs; we are flaring the glut of natural gas, which is the ideal fuel for electric generation. Appoint a commission to review our policy.
6153 2018-07-05 14:24:20 The core Fed investment in Lagos stopped after the FCT was moved into Abuja it is not an excuse for oil producing state not to develop even more than Lagos with the enormous resource given to them simply put the oil producing state have being producing pen robbers as Governors .

6163 2018-07-05 14:23:45 Funny how this is coming mere days after he demanded Saudi-Arabia produce more oil because Venezuela isn't "delivering". Total coincidence, of course. He is legitimately concerned for democracy and the suffering people of Venezuela.
6164 2018-07-05 14:23:28 Indeed so. In my view China have gone beyond complaining & aim for a Buyers' Club pricing bids vs Shanghai (Yuan is irrelevant in pure spot pricing/unit of account terms) to create an LME -style buy-side physical benchmark. China has a >700m bbl oil reserve pool to back this up
6165 2018-07-05 14:23:12 Booming for corporations that got that 14% PERMANENT tax cut! The ones that bought back their own stock, in particular. Not so for the working scum with the TEMPORARY 2.9% cut sucked up by higher gas, heating oil, and health care costs! Better use another pitch for mid-terms!

It’s in Saudis/Sunni oil producers best interest to lower gas prices because POTUS knows it puts more pressure on Iran and Russia.
6180 2018-07-05 14:21:47 I know it's supposed to aid sleep and relaxation. Whether it will help sleep paralysis remains to be seen. Sprinkle some lavender oil on your pillow?
6181 2018-07-05 14:21:46 Maybe we should get oil from Nigeria and dump Arab countries
6182 2018-07-05 14:21:44 .You know what I learned in High School?  OPEC is not in the business of controlling oil just because American prices are too high. 

Now having an effective POTUS that didn't call people from their countries terrorists & would promote alternative fuel sources could lower prices.
6183 2018-07-05 14:21:43 Thanks for asking. All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight.

6190 2018-07-05 14:21:14 U put to much!!! And did you put oil on it after like i said ?
6191 2018-07-05 14:21:12 Tech is the new oil.
6192 2018-07-05 14:21:07 .@realDonaldTrump Bhai Crude Oil ke prices kam huye kya tweet ke baad? Ya log tere tweet bhi ignore kar dete hain hamare jaise?
6193 2018-07-05 14:21:02 Exactly!  Oil prices more dependent on outside influences.!
6194 2018-07-05 14:20:59 After that too...there will be some blockage...for smooth working you have to put some oil and use some extra force to make it work...(ghosts of legs, never understand talks)
6195 2018-07-05 14:20:59 Is it oil, diamonds, gold, or simply more election swindling that you are after?  Or do they all just have you with kompromat?  You look like a god damn hostage in that photo.  Whatever it is you are a TRAITOR.  Don’t bother coming home.
6196 2018-07-05 14:20:55 โอ๊ยยยยพี่โน่
6197 2018-07-05 14:20:54 As you note, math isn't difficult, and this is a simple restatement of this math, so I'm afraid I don't see what's misleading here. Oil prices are up, and AB is continuing to rebound from the 2014–15 downturn. 
6198 2018-07-05 14:20:50 President Trump's focus on the recent rise in oil puts into question the strength of the economy.

If the economy can't bear the weight of $3 gasoline, how strong is it?

6214 2018-07-05 14:19:37 Today is not my day. I got almost run over twice, chain flew of my bicycle and my bike bell is broken. At least I got rid of most of the oil...

Makin' certain you don't notice really isn't so hard
You're so busy with your guns & all of your excuses to use them.
Well, it's oil for the rich and babies for the poor,
We got everyone believin' that more is more,
6216 2018-07-05 14:19:29 @IngrahamAngle Think we really need opec to do anything??? or sell some oil at the going rate after all - build a wall - get ice up to full force - there is around 700 MILL barrels 
Average price paid for oil in the Reserve - $29.70 per barrel
 Drawdown Capability
6217 2018-07-05 14:19:21 Soon enough!  Before I head down, gotta get an oil change on the truck and new spark plugs.  My truck for being a 4  cylinder takes 8 spark plugs.  2 plugs/cylinder.
6218 2018-07-05 14:19:17 @UBS 1/3: We have lifted our six- and 12-month #Brent forecasts to USD 85/bbl. The negative impact of higher oil prices on the world economy is less than in the past. Globally, 7% less oil is needed to produce the same amount of GDP compared with 2007. #oil #oilprice #brentprice
6219 2018-07-05 14:18:55 It had an awful lot of words for an oil painting.

6227 2018-07-05 14:18:16 Sitting US Senator Bernie Sanders is doing absolutely nothing but selling snake oil as he did in 2016. If popular Bernie get 1-2 GOPers to join with DEMS, all DJT policies & court appointments would be BLOCKED. Divisive Bernie is not a consensus builder.

6231 2018-07-05 14:17:55 Wreck with injuries in front of Redmond Regional Medical Center with possible entrapment.  A vehicle is on its side and there is oil on the road.  Drive with caution.
6232 2018-07-05 14:17:53 They’re crazy simple. You drizzle a little oil inside and then turn it on like a tiny oven. Hard to screw up! Taquitos, wontons, frozen fries... it’s awesome for baked potatoes too, though not much faster on potatoes than your regular oven.

6239 2018-07-05 14:16:43 Ummmm....Obama allowed ISIS to make billions in oil revenue rather than pollute the environment and bomb the stolen oil fields. What do you think they did with that money? Obama wanted Israel to go back to its 1967 borders!!!!!! What????

6259 2018-07-05 14:15:18 Not necessarily. The deficit only represents goods bought in excess of the other country. Since US has 10 times the population of Canada, the only reason numbers are even close is amt of oil, alum, steel, and hydro US gets from Canada.
6260 2018-07-05 14:15:17 CGI I do want to work online. it about the oil.
6261 2018-07-05 14:15:11 hmmm Well you are an oil person who would be welcomed there, not shot or imprisoned in those lovely countries with such great human rights.
6262 2018-07-05 14:15:07 Yesterday I bought the wrong scented beard oil, now my face smells like peppermint crisp. 

I ain't mad tho.
6263 2018-07-05 14:14:57 Firstly, I haven't the foggiest idea what the Spanish or any other EU member pay immigrants, that's their business. In UK millions of EU citizens felt disenfranchised, the kind who have no use for a passport, or studying in France or the tax on Olive oil, hence referendum result.
6264 2018-07-05 14:14:53 I thought Jason was talking about Christy Clark and BC Libs Corruption Club, but no he's just talking about ordinary citizens protesting big Oil.  Can't go having any of that free speech nonsense here in Canada can we.
6265 2018-07-05 14:14:52 That's the plan. Russia was suffering with low oil prices. They are a major producer.
6266 2018-07-05 14:14:50 OPEC are blackmailing through hike prices of oil & natural gas. Development countries are suffering  from oil & gas prices.
6267 2018-07-05 14:14:49 Menurut aku bisa, kayak pori pori tuh tersamarkan gitu dan oil control nya juara
6268 2018-07-05 14:14:34 You miss the point here sir,the port is a major advantage to Lagos state so also is the oil  a major advantage to others  but one state was able to make better use of the advantage while d other was unlucky to hve thiefs as governor s 4rm Dipreye to GEJ to Dickson then be d same.
6269 2018-07-05 14:14:32 Why? They talk by phone almost daily.  This is theater to normalize treason and to embark on the largest oil grab in history.  putin wants his money and he’s got a #puppet to give it to him.

6275 2018-07-05 14:13:43 A few days back another gentleman Salil Tripathi mocked the surname of Smriti Irani juxtaposing it with the ongoing oil issue with Iran. Silence.

6292 2018-07-05 14:12:30 I find it fascinating that the car industry, which stands to make billions from EVs, is trying to slow the transition, while oil majors, who stand to lose billions, are trying to speed it up 
6293 2018-07-05 14:12:28 Look those congressional members that went to Moscow are there to support trump after he meets w/ Putin ! Trump will lift sanctions and they will back him! It’s all about OIL!
6294 2018-07-05 14:12:14 2/2 Mayo doesn't see high temps. Best with olive oil
 - Beyond cold-pressed oils - mechanical or solvent extraction = much seed oil in  food chain
- High oleic used for frying + aldehyde by-products ...
Easy to over consume & mop up oxidative by-products internally! Vit E helps.
6295 2018-07-05 14:12:14 Just got back from visiting a reservation last week in ND, talking w/native people living in an area overrun with flaming oil wells. I think its good FB bot flagged "Merciless Indian Savages". We're not assholes that way anymore. Even when indigenous people are central american.
6296 2018-07-05 14:12:14 We are going to blame you and your party, for sixteen years u looted our oil boom, till date,you continue in d Senate with outrageous salaries and allowances,l am afraid you contributed a lot!
6297 2018-07-05 14:12:10 Great difference between plastics made from oil and residue materials fr agriculture or forestry respectively. The reason is that most plastics end up in inceneration after first use cycle. We hope to improve recycling but that will take time and is a challenge

6302 2018-07-05 14:11:52 I just bought a cool new conch seashell! Benghazi has nothing to do with a man named Ben Gahzi! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Who will win the War 4 Water!
6303 2018-07-05 14:11:51 We need oil right now for many things. Like  heating our cars and trucks to move our supplies.  Yes, I would like to see the end of fossil fuel. So suing won't help. What if the oil companies says OK you win. We will not sell any  more fossil fuel?
6304 2018-07-05 14:11:46 Gas been going up since November. Big oil has no incentive to keep prices low with Trumpy and Pruitt dismantling all efforts at alternative energy.
6305 2018-07-05 14:11:44 You call me a hypocrite which I am not. I am stating facts in terms of Trudeau policies and statements with actual data. Trudeau said Harper was too focus on oil and yet Trudeau's GDP numbers reflect the importance of oil.
6306 2018-07-05 14:11:43 Sad day. There are some markets that are just more efficient with turboprops, but somehow the US airline industry lost their way. Even with oil at $70 a barrel they want to put a jet on every city pair. The Dash 8 is a great airplane. I’m sad to see her go.
6307 2018-07-05 14:11:37 Didn't he just ask Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to lower our gas prices? How is this being independent?

6322 2018-07-05 14:10:07 Oil moves up just as Trump resumes tweeting
6323 2018-07-05 14:10:01 Bt that doesn't change the fact that oil prices is going up so its nt useful to update ...
6324 2018-07-05 14:09:45 3/3 - and who benefits from that?  The US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and all of the other world oil producers.  Greenpeace is not impacting demand.  If anything they’re impacting supply and hurting the CDN economy.
6325 2018-07-05 14:09:41 Those arent vegan products. 
Anyone can make processed plant based food factory and claimed to be a vegan and still using plastic and palm oil that kill many.
All vegans been protesting about this as well. Boycott.
6326 2018-07-05 14:09:41 Bio oil coba aku sih pake itu ya walaupun lumayan mahal tp worth it sih
6327 2018-07-05 14:09:38 Face oil 
6328 2018-07-05 14:09:35 Nails n toes, oil change, car wash

6330 2018-07-05 14:09:31 i also see Koch brothers trying to block rapid transit country wide all to the detriment of climate all for GAS/OIL!
6331 2018-07-05 14:09:25 @CMof karnataka
Where is the justification to continue Annabhagya and Indira bhaghya schemes since the purpose is one and the same ie feeding poor/providing food  free?Under Annabhagya,free rice, oil, sugar, and salt etc and increase the quantity. stop Indira canteen
6332 2018-07-05 14:09:14 I don’t really use mine anymore, but I usually try to oil cleanse, along with a foam cleanser. Dk how it would work with dry skin though.
6333 2018-07-05 14:09:04 ever heard of sunflower oil, Mr Pretentious?
6334 2018-07-05 14:08:54 Hi my car is done with their oil change 
What to do now ..... I'm off
6335 2018-07-05 14:08:52 EVs - no oil changes, no coolant corrosion, no transmission, brakes last a way long time, should be usable forever with no depreciation, stupid not to buy
6336 2018-07-05 14:08:52 I’m confused.  In December 2015 Congress lifted the ban on exporting US oil. That’s when our prices went up here.  Seems to me that if we stop exporting our own oil, price would go down.  But US oil companies would be angry.
6337 2018-07-05 14:08:42 The oil companies denied global warming for decades, have people like Trump saying its a hoax. Because of money. And now, it’s yes, it exists but stopping oil/coal use isn’t going to help. Because of money.
6338 2018-07-05 14:08:40 Why not just make black bean burgers with spices and skip all the processed ingredients and fats? Coconut oil is unhealthy (American Heart Association). You are essentially saying the Impossible Burger is  great alternative to hamburger - but both cause significant health issues.
6339 2018-07-05 14:08:37 Slicker than niggas olive oil
6340 2018-07-05 14:08:36 What are you planning to do Traitor. Cut a deal with the Russians to import oil. We are going too have you removed from office in order to save our Republic.
6341 2018-07-05 14:08:28 I just accepted Russian oil money, am I doing it right?
6342 2018-07-05 14:08:18 My only question was… i ONLY use olive oil, avocado oil, Kerrygold butter. Should i worry about baking at high temps with these because of smoke points. Would it be better to just put the oils on after?
6343 2018-07-05 14:08:16 Cooking oil is actually fucking mint for tanning I just stink

6348 2018-07-05 14:07:57 2/2 - but I also see Greenpeace funded by US interests attacking our oil and gas sector - and ONLY Cda’s oil and gas sector - but not Saudi Arabia’s or Russia’s or Kuwait’s or a whole host of other countries. So greenpeace is trying to hurt Canada and my provinces of Alb/Sask 2/3
6349 2018-07-05 14:07:55 Turkana  leaders want to meet Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i as the  stalemate on insecurity that has seen a stoppage of oil transportation  from the county to Mombasa persists.

6353 2018-07-05 14:07:31 Increasing American oil production is good for MAGA. Most patriotic Americans hate OPEC monopoly and love  like America First policies.we're nationalists first. Charity begins at home. Thank you , President Trump, for fighting against the thieves and liars in the DC swamp.
6354 2018-07-05 14:07:28 Mr. Kuch bhi. Your favorite party in Karnataka increased petrol price. You criticised when oil companies  decreased prices by 1 paise.
6355 2018-07-05 14:07:22 Retweet if I support?  What do I do if I think you and he are both ambulance chasers looking for the next sucker to believe your conspiracy theories and/or buy your snake oil remedies?  How about a big #GFY.  (God forgives you)

6363 2018-07-05 14:06:37 @PretUsa Was so excited to have my morning croissant only to realize it was drenched in oil. Tasted like it was deep fried and not baked. #Disappointed
6364 2018-07-05 14:06:37 The United States isn't bound by international courts. The money was also potential damages for the hostages Iran took years ago. Obama wanted legacy & Europe wants cheap oil. Don't sell me a ball of crap.
6365 2018-07-05 14:06:36 Turmeric is the best! I use one blended with coconut oil. Better for absorption

-  Key problem of processed food intake is refined seed giving hi omega-6 linoleic acid - dilutes the opposing effect of omega-3 = inflammation
- I like mayo which needs oil (won't work with fat) canola prominent
6367 2018-07-05 14:06:29 @deptoflabour hi guys. My cousin has just been injured at work. A pot of hot cooking oil fell on her arm. Her employers refuse to allow her to go to hospital or go report it. Could you please advise us on where to go forward with this?

6370 2018-07-05 14:06:07 The 1 on the right looks like motor oil, I'll use it to service a ragga
6371 2018-07-05 14:05:33 There’s no thing as too much olive oil 
6372 2018-07-05 14:05:30 That’s right.  In fact, oils should be somewhat on high price side to ensure energy efficiencies progress.  So far, US energy efficiency gains have moderated impact of oil price rises.
6373 2018-07-05 14:05:30 Holding tight here...#China #consumer #tech #stocks are offering pretty attractive entry points but prefer to let the trading day settle out before doing much.  Global #oil plays are paying off too. Highest conviction sector for us (International)
6374 2018-07-05 14:05:28 Exactly. Men are not allowed to take off their uniform at work (suit/tie).  Women CAN put a sweater on. Why should everything now cater to women.  The feminists are literally never happy.
We nee more women garbage collectors, more women sewage workers, more women on oil rigs!
6375 2018-07-05 14:05:08 I need to get my oil change in my truck soon because it’s way over due.
6376 2018-07-05 14:05:08 Trump demanded that the Chinese lower the deficit by ~300MM; now he's demanding OPEC lower oil prices! What the heck! He talks more like a command and control communist than the Chinese themselves!

6378 2018-07-05 14:04:47 Hi Lon.  Fair point.  Message was a little “smart-assy” but I stick by it.  That stunt did nothing to impact world oil demand.  I actually do work in both the oil and gas and the renewables sector.  I see the prices of wind and solar and know how competitive they are.  1/2
6379 2018-07-05 14:04:33 He has taken for granted the whole Ukrianian race ! This is not a cookie to bargain with ! Or a bronze age to talk about ownership of a nation with a weapon power !!! GOD WILLS A BREAKTHROUGH IN NUCLEAR FUSION - HE CAN KEEP HIS GAS N OIL FOR BREAKFAST!

6383 2018-07-05 14:04:00 I see a quick hit to attack me, right? Trudeau said from the get go that Canada should not be focus on oil. Oil is still be part of the economy which is my point.

In the future if you are going to attack me then suggest you read my information!
6384 2018-07-05 14:03:56 この小学生ただ場を混乱させるだけして探索する気が全くない
6385 2018-07-05 14:03:49 Of course, you could also use this as a reason to invest in alternative energy sources, like wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear. You know, less demand for oil generally results in lower prices....
6386 2018-07-05 14:03:45 Omg it felt fine waiting here for my oil change but the air just came on right above ME and now I'm freezing lol.
6387 2018-07-05 14:03:35 รด 2 vs มต 0
6388 2018-07-05 14:03:22 This also applies to not processed coconut oil?
6389 2018-07-05 14:03:19 After all the bashing of most oil producing countries you now expect them to "obey" you!  This is definitely a genius and artful negotiating tactic! Honestly, just when I think I have seen it all  in your dumb tweets, you still manage to come up with more! Truly incredible!
6390 2018-07-05 14:03:17 Pet peeve: spelling Fluor as Flour. You work in oil and gas, not a bakery.
6391 2018-07-05 14:03:04 It's really not about supply and demand, when it comes to oil. We have enough supply to meet the demand for years to come. The actual issue is about artificial manipulations by OPEC. There is also the issue of refineries... But, what do I know?
6392 2018-07-05 14:02:56 China is shaking things up with the oil business.

6400 2018-07-05 14:02:18 @Happy4Humankind It is obvious that you can get anybody to say something dumb about happiness for the additional notoriety this kind of mass marketing creates. There is no such thing a "sustainable happiness."  We are going through a revival of early snake oil hype.
6401 2018-07-05 14:02:16 I've had to self medicate for a while now. My Dr. Is fine with it. He agreed with CBD oil. His hands are tied at this point in being able to help. me with pain.
6402 2018-07-05 14:02:06 San Miguel Corporation denies that it expressed interest in particularly acquiring state oil and gas assets in Malaysia following reports that the latter is looking to revisit options for privatization to trim down its debts. (via @cnnphilippines)
6403 2018-07-05 14:02:04 & then there are electric cars which apparently are the future. OPEC might want to remember that. Plus oil is a fossil fuel. Isn't it?
6404 2018-07-05 14:02:02 Apparently, Trump's is attempting a CYA strategy regarding OPEC.  Presumbly he understands how Oil markets set price, and I trust he is aware of potential supply shocks.
6405 2018-07-05 14:02:02 Amen. I receive the oil of favour in Jesus name.

6408 2018-07-05 14:01:46 If we run inflation on the price of oil the price will be more than $300
The price of Pepsi is much higher than the price of oil
IS THAT FAIR ????????????

6411 2018-07-05 14:01:39 Did it work? I find with CBD oil I get a weird anxiety, but the CBD leaf works very nicely.
6412 2018-07-05 14:01:37 I'm intrigued that (1) Ottawa is dealing Karlsson and Ryan, and (2) Maroon has not yet signed anywhere. Sens will need to get to cap floor, and Oil will need to shed salary to sign Maroon. I wonder if the Oilers have a deal in place with Ottawa, pending a Karlsson deal.

6441 2018-07-05 13:59:15 Do you suggest that Canada imports the oil that we use? How would we replace the lost income? Would we import  from US? Do you think we might end up paying tariffs? What would your plans cost the average household?

6448 2018-07-05 13:57:56 You are truly an idiot. If you slap sanctions on oil producing countries they are going to ignore you. You don’t boss OPEC around. You know absolutely nothing of global financial markets. Don’t be looking from help from any countries as you play trade war.

6452 2018-07-05 13:57:44 and trade war fears perhaps. still think the oil supply shock vs global slowdown is driving the divergence more

6458 2018-07-05 13:57:31 Its normal , the Oil&Gas authority say so but im still worried they might be telling porkies
6459 2018-07-05 13:57:28 I'm familiar with how much money they did throw around, especially when oil prices were up a few years ago. Those were also for established stars and for high prospects. Not sure if Simon really fits the requirements of either one.
6460 2018-07-05 13:57:22 @Kristileenews Hi! Would you be willing to share which CBD oil you used for your pup? I've got one that hates the car, and nothing helps him.
6461 2018-07-05 13:57:22 Most of oil producers are developed countries (3rd world) who there income depends on oil for there interests that oil prices to raise up. Its very unfair for the giant producers to increase oil productions to help the rich countries economies deprived producers prices increament
6462 2018-07-05 13:57:19 Of course #Trump is obsessed with #Venezuela . Time for him to steal some oil.
6463 2018-07-05 13:57:10 That happens sometimes to people. I use CBD oil w/out THC in it. It helps with my tremors.

6465 2018-07-05 13:56:47 Add baby oil to whatever you put on and maybe get a shower gel with oils in it too so your skin doesn't get that dry
6466 2018-07-05 13:56:37 Comment is directed to the entire onshore oil and gas exploration industry, rather than UKOG specifically. I think I'm correct that this summit is all the companies together?
6467 2018-07-05 13:56:36 太った方がモテるっていうの今までよく分からんかったけど確かに脱いで男がガリガリだったらドン引きするわ……って価値観を手にした
6468 2018-07-05 13:56:29 yep. apart for sound occasions to promote carbon transition.
6469 2018-07-05 13:56:28 Is this how you think it works??
1) All-powerful POTUS tweets displeasure w/ US gas prices
2) Cowering OPEC quakes in fear
3) OPEC compliantly convenes to lower crude oil prices
4) All principles of economics are therefore changed

Your job isn't watching TV and tweeting.

6470 2018-07-05 13:56:26 T: "cheap Russian Oil is the answer to our economic woes"?
6471 2018-07-05 13:56:21 Rough morning:

goodbye money I hardly new ya!
6472 2018-07-05 13:56:12 People the writing is on the wall, land expropriation without compensation is a reality, oil your weapons to defend what is yours. The criminal ANC government is now overstepping their powers and are now becoming thieves. My land will not be taken I will defend what is mine.
6473 2018-07-05 13:56:06 oil changes really take forever and bout 3 days
6474 2018-07-05 13:55:51 we checked back in to our seoul hotel and they gave us each a 5 step korean skincare sample set. incredible. ur fave could never. we’re now on step 03 (horse oil sheet mask) and listening to burial
6475 2018-07-05 13:55:48 You have GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! Just cause it’s July 4 they think they can just cruise on over and do what they want? Or maybe they just wanted their oil.

6481 2018-07-05 13:55:29 Northern Ireland doesn't have anywhere near the amount of oil Scotland has.

6486 2018-07-05 13:54:55 I deadass taught Matt how to put oil in my car yesterday .
6487 2018-07-05 13:54:50 It's what he wants for Wall St speculators!Trump is certainly invested in oil.

6490 2018-07-05 13:54:35 I ideally, IPPs should have been decommissioned since there's no drough.Since the cost of fuel is directly passed to consumers, the can expect their bills to remain high, particularly with the rise in global oil prices.

6493 2018-07-05 13:54:09 of course not!  My point is doesn't seem as if US is king of the oil market...that was all
6494 2018-07-05 13:53:59 Because as usual some white nations are good in causing wars like those in the Sahel region to steal oil. Don't forget white folks risk their lives to set foot on Africa and loot all the riches.
6495 2018-07-05 13:53:57 Mulai menggunakan minyak lagi, tapi di Tamanu oil kok wanginya kayak bumbu indomi soto??  Ga halu kan ini 
6496 2018-07-05 13:53:51 Ahhh. Thank you!! That's what I was going for, although I don't have truffle oil or artisanal handcrafted mushrooms to put in it
6497 2018-07-05 13:53:48 The main driver behind high oil prices is your withdrawal from the Iran deal and also the November ultimatum for countries to stop buying it. Before you posted that oil was at 63$ and heading lower. Why dont you release the strategic reserves? You have no idea how markets work...

6506 2018-07-05 13:53:10 Didn't your tax cut give the oil companies billions more in savings? So why arent they using that savings to lower prices?

6508 2018-07-05 13:53:07 Corn Oil, Corn flakes, Corn Sugar (fructose in Sodas), Purely Corn feed for Chicken and Cattle (hence in meat and dairy). The rest is filled with Soya. This has led to more than one third citizens getting obese with multitude of life style diseases.
6509 2018-07-05 13:53:07 And people with investment in oil are always concerned about investment. Not everyone cares about the environment. Yes, I am an investor in oil.
6510 2018-07-05 13:53:06 Another war for oil.
6511 2018-07-05 13:53:02 Putin is in stronger position on Iran than cheeto, make stronger diplomatic ties with Tehran and offer Russian flagged tankers to haul oil and dare cheeto to do anything about it.
6512 2018-07-05 13:53:01 People who didn't vote for it will also suffer. People who did and were swayed by the snake oil salesmen of leave don't really deserve it and I'm remain. You need to go a fair bit up the food chain when apportioning blame.
6513 2018-07-05 13:52:56 Oh dear, do u really want his mother's photo? Well, it's known that Englishmen drive themselves crazy with argentine women. Remember in 1806 and 1807 when they tried to invade Buenos Aires and the women burnt the English soldiers with hot oil. The survivors married those women!

6516 2018-07-05 13:52:34 Getting my oil changed and having a full tank of gas really makes me feel like I have my life together
6517 2018-07-05 13:52:33 I get that fascists have to use revisionism to sell their snake oil, but this has nothing to do with McCarthyism. He spouts fascist rhetoric in public and the public has every right to shun him mercilessly for it.
6518 2018-07-05 13:52:30 Let’s keep drilling for oil and mining coal like a bunch of cavemen - Smart!
6519 2018-07-05 13:52:23 You're confusing me and seem to be twittering on another country. This action was taken precisely to not only halt theft of Libyan oil as doc by Audit Bureau report, but also the perpetuation of the nexus of militias+organized crime+CBL corruption that holds all #Libya hostage.
6520 2018-07-05 13:52:19 Pipelines vs rail is a false argument oil industry wants both. Irving oil gets Bakken shale via rail while pipelines like Energy East or Line 3, kxl, or Kinder Morgan carry tar sands. Stop misinforming the public.
6521 2018-07-05 13:51:49 Are you also going to deny that he was trying to shut down all of our refineries he wanted to ship our oil overseas to have refined and sent back to us

6524 2018-07-05 13:51:39 It's easy to make. A blender can do it, but you usually need a bit more oil than I like to put in mine.  =)  I get 2 1/2 ounce packages of fresh basil from my local Hy-Vee, rough-chop about 2-4 garlic cloves depending on garlic tolerance, approximately 1 cup of parmesan & the evo
6525 2018-07-05 13:51:33 Buy him:
-Coconut Oil
-A du-Rag
-A Diane or Royal Brush (you can only get these online unfortunately)

all he has to do is keep brushing with his hair well moisturized & put a du-rag on for sleep or when he can to save progress

But its hard asf , i been at it for 8years

6535 2018-07-05 13:50:33 Vegan products are fresh fruits, legume, seeds, root, grians and vegetables 
if you buy processed foods, vegan or non-vegans they arent healthy.
they are carcinogens and contains palm oil that kills orangutans
6536 2018-07-05 13:50:24 South Africa is not a member of OPEC countries as it doesn't produce oil so oil prices is beyond ramphosa or south africa input.. even when oil prices go up they affect all countries in world

6560 2018-07-05 13:48:07 And livestock... And palm oil... Not just soybeans.
6561 2018-07-05 13:48:05 I don't know why it's called that, but there are many different kinds of it.  Basil pesto is usually used as a pasta 'sauce' but can be put in other things, too.  It's fresh basil, garlic, fresh-grated parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and extra virgin olive oil.  It's delicious.  =)
6562 2018-07-05 13:48:03 “‘OPEC has not defined oil prices for the past 30 years,’ Kazempour said. ‘You impose sanctions on major producers, founders of OPEC, and yet you are asking them to reduce the prices?’”

He’s got a point.

6569 2018-07-05 13:47:37 You know what would be the coolest? Meeting @taylorswift13 in Indianapolis at Lucas oil stadium on September 15, 2018 at approximately 5:30pm. That would be the coolest.
6570 2018-07-05 13:47:33 True, but doing deals with a minor state over oil is a very different class of information compared to.. for example... strategic placement of military assets.
6571 2018-07-05 13:47:28 Who benefits from higher oil prices?  Is there any specific country or counties that are exclusively a oil economy?
6572 2018-07-05 13:47:24 Well I hope it brought luck lol my room smells like cooking oil at times because my window is facing their open air kitchen
6573 2018-07-05 13:47:23 HIV too. The oil has been used for many aspects of the disease, including nausea, appetite, pain and nocturnal sedation. I’d be very interested in trialling this. Possibly reducing pill / med load by 6 things. And of course this would potentially save money. Potentially.
6574 2018-07-05 13:47:20 they are greedy   when can America stand  alone  and we produce are own oil and gas!!????

6578 2018-07-05 13:46:52 If we run inflation on the price of oil the price will be more than $300
The price of Pepsi is much higher than the price of oil
IS THAT FAIR ????????????
6579 2018-07-05 13:46:51 Dumping Airline stocks with fuel going up and should be at $100 barrel and that is the break even factor according to many CEO in the oil business here in Texas ! Get out while you can also some Airlines are just too big to function they’re out of control! Can’t manage !

6581 2018-07-05 13:46:50 @realDonaldTrump @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews  When George HW Bush invaded IRAQ, the United States should've definitely taken the Oil from Saddam Hussein and t/Middle East! Big time Mistake! #USA

6583 2018-07-05 13:46:37 IF We compare OIL prices with other commodities PRICE increase we will find that oil has not INCREASED as much as other commodities
Price of oil still almost the same with all the all the inflation that has gone through
6584 2018-07-05 13:46:31 All the more reason to break our dependency on oil... but will never happen, too powerful to break those lobbies.  #WillNotEndWell

6586 2018-07-05 13:46:28 They did 3000 bombing sorties in syria, committing genocide, theyre also backing genocide in yemen, theyre armed the moderate rebels in syria, or as rest of the world calls them isis. Theyre also arming boko haram with the french. Oil, diamonds, emeralds, opium their lust
6587 2018-07-05 13:46:25 it doesn’t fit the narrative.  The one where the trillion $ oil industry is stamped out and replaced by green industries that are neither functional or economical. Or how budgets balance themselves. Or how diversity is more import then merit. Or how tax the rich fixes everything

6589 2018-07-05 13:46:19 Glad he cares more about spreading lies and protecting his oil buddies than protecting the planet. He does know if the planet goes to hell, so do we right?
6590 2018-07-05 13:46:08 The trend for oil prices looks exactly like that. Smarty pants.
6591 2018-07-05 13:46:08 @realDonaldTrump the big problem is all the oil we're exporting because big oil can get a better price selling it on the open market than they can keeping it in the U.S., so your policy of deregulation and opening up nat'l monuments to exploration do no good
6592 2018-07-05 13:46:07 I thought the US under your dictatorship was energy independent because of leaking oil pipelines you allowed..maybe you should burn more coal and add the coal sludge into your rivers and steams.

6596 2018-07-05 13:45:57 Hey US, remember when Venezuela’s Chavez offered to supply needy Americans with free oil when world oil prices were ginormous? And what was the US response? Oh yes, it was to destabilize the Venezuelan economy. (Source: *Confessions...* by John Perkins)

6619 2018-07-05 13:43:47 Can someone explain why we "buy" oil at "Brent Crude" prices (North Sea oil) when we get it from cheaper elsewhere.
6620 2018-07-05 13:43:45 Does that mean we can expect a Trump tweet blaming EIA inventory data for driving the price of oil higher?
6621 2018-07-05 13:43:38 "Saudi Arabia cut pricing for August sales of its light oil grade to Asia" Last time I looked, the United States of America wasn't in Asia! #misleading.

6627 2018-07-05 13:43:11 No No Mr. Trump! Prices of Oil should be keeping high! If you don´t like that, buy Petrobrás shares!

6636 2018-07-05 13:42:18 What the hell blah blah blah, US have no business half way around the world block selling oil and supply weapons to the other side.
6637 2018-07-05 13:42:14 Oil companies in the US are always producing as much as they can. They still as many wells as they can afford etc.
6638 2018-07-05 13:42:12 Too much oil. I don't like oil

6640 2018-07-05 13:42:08 Trump should remember that it was the US that enabled OPEC to exist in the first place. Trade oil in the US$ and the military will protect your/our oil interests. Cue the petrodollar and goodbye gold standard. Good work Kissinger.

6643 2018-07-05 13:41:59 by the way the " why don't you stop using oil if you hate it so much" argument is childish. No one is saying we don't use oil. Point is too have strategy to gear down not triple flow.
6644 2018-07-05 13:41:54 An oil change and airbag recall has turned into a $620 repair. Solid day off thus far. I should just ride my bike everywhere
6645 2018-07-05 13:41:49 I thought the Republican plan was to overexploit oil reserves in the US to end dependency on oil?  Ever non-fossil fuel sources?  Of course not because youre an idiot and youre in this for nobody but yourself.
6646 2018-07-05 13:41:49 Barrel of oil just went up $10 more.

6649 2018-07-05 13:41:38 It’s not about wantjng the US to withdraw from the global oil market it’s more about wanting them to stop meddling in everyone’s business for the sake of oil
6650 2018-07-05 13:41:22 Okay thanks ingat bole consider double cleansing. Will try another cleansing oil hehe
6651 2018-07-05 13:41:21 Hey "Patriot", what the hell does that have to do with oil prices?
6652 2018-07-05 13:41:18 1-2) Increasing the output of oil & gas is just ONE DETERMINANT FACTOR among many others for stabilizing the price of oil & gas. As i said earlier: Arab states & Russia can increase the level of their production & cover the need of global market; even when Iran's oil & gas
6653 2018-07-05 13:41:13 Yes, as long as the world needs oil, I want Canadians to provide it.
6654 2018-07-05 13:41:12 I work in the oil industry and am pretty familiar wit its workings. The government telling the oil industry to up production would be moot
6655 2018-07-05 13:41:08 Well that was an awful meal from @ONeillsPubs Bournemouth. Couldn't seem to count up to 10 wings, oil soaked onion rings, glazed wings were just wings covered in bottled BBQ sauce. BBQ gravy is just the same BBQ sauce just heavily watered down on a meal already full of BBQ sauce

6663 2018-07-05 13:40:02 It mustn't be forgotten that during the last 5 years of Zuma presidency, oil was cheap.
6664 2018-07-05 13:40:02 Then the Drudge Reported POTUS to MBS request to up oil production. They wanted more but I left them hanging. I just wanted to assure them that the coming chaos will be a good thing and that all will be well..
6665 2018-07-05 13:39:58 It's odd that no one discusses the real reason Trump wants to invade Venezuela; he wants their oil.
6666 2018-07-05 13:39:53 Tried Bullet coffee with only coconut oil. No sugar, milk or other additives. Feeling real grown up right now. Excuse me, I’m having a moment...
6667 2018-07-05 13:39:50 i just condition it a lot!! , i use things like coconut oil and stuff for curly hair. i’m really like obsessed with my hair so i put work into it
6668 2018-07-05 13:39:47 By this logic Alberta would accept unlimited liability for an oil spill, and also share the cost of flood prevention in Richmond (and elsewhere in BC) required due to rising sea levels...

6673 2018-07-05 13:39:20 It seems @JustinTrudeau has a ace card on his side in his negotiations  with @realDonaldTrump ?  The tide of rising oil prices in causing a surge in revenues from the Canadian oil sands.  If Trudeau does decide to dig in , it's going to be a rough ride.
6674 2018-07-05 13:39:18 No, it's like asking someone who peddles snake oil to prove their snake oil works.  It's very simple.

6679 2018-07-05 13:39:08 Every time I get my oil changed, I curse myself out for getting this damn car. 
6680 2018-07-05 13:39:07 Why is it okay to commit premeditated murder on the senior citizen that truly owns the oil.. John Lang and commit stalking, harassing, and threats on his daughter Carla Lang daily..
6681 2018-07-05 13:39:04 But honestly if the US was to stop buying or taking oil from other countries and just use our own. Don’t you think it would do more harm then good? The wealthy Middle East would lose their biggest buyer and economically start destabilizing them before morally
6682 2018-07-05 13:39:04 The administration has threatened close allies such as South Korea with sanctions if they don't cut off Iranian imports by early November. South Korea accounted for 14 percent of Iran's oil exports last year, according to the U.S. Energy Department.
6683 2018-07-05 13:39:02 @realDonaldTrump OPEC has lost much of its power over pricing.  
Many more size able players are in the markets now.
They saw what happened when they tried to squeeze us the last time.
Even so, to reduce the world's access to oil by 20+% is horrific

6687 2018-07-05 13:38:27 True. Oil in the Niger Delta, gold and diamonds in South Africa, coltan and numerous minerals in the DRC... The story is the same: destruction, environmental degradation and death for Africans, money for the West.
6688 2018-07-05 13:38:23 aloe vera & coconut oil should do the trick!!! the aloe will soothe and moisturize and coconut oil is a natural (but very low like 4-ish) SPF

6711 2018-07-05 13:36:31 maybe MSNBC wants a nuclear standoff, but once the North realizes what they are missing, this will all change. 
The oil pipeline from Germany to North Korea will replace nuclear power being developed there.
6712 2018-07-05 13:36:25 Yup oil for you. Try natgas its worse but waiting patiently for triggers in crude is the key. You don't need to trade it everyday. I personally don't trade everyday myself if their is no setup I don't take a trade and I don't chase a trade. I wait for setups. No setup no trade...

6735 2018-07-05 13:34:06 taking a look into the total amount of $ we give to Saudi (including military) would be an interesting wake up call. But I still favor tariffs that spur oil production here at home. The bite we feel from inflated gas prices will be more than eased by offsetting consumer prices.

6860 2018-07-05 13:19:54 Do we believe Trump wanted to invade Venezuela to "help the ppl"?  Isn't it more likely he wanted an easily won war after which he could claim their oil fields for himself, er, for America? The man is utterly blind to humanity.
6861 2018-07-05 13:19:50 US shale oil producers are happy with OPEC. They thrive on high oil prices. Ditto Cdn oil sands producers.
6862 2018-07-05 13:19:44 Back in early 80's I had high hopes for Mexico's future with their oil. Their leadership was more interested in lining their pockets and wasting their time at the Zona Rosa and private clubs. They blew and are still blowing it.
6863 2018-07-05 13:19:30 OPEC members are smiling all the way to the Bank with our money. The other side of the Trade of product from OPEC are the Marketers and Oil Jobbers in the U.S. too are smiling as their cash flow increases with the price we pay at the pump. U. S. Consumers pay THE $$$ bottom line.

6868 2018-07-05 13:18:52 The price of oil is less than 75% of its high of $112. However gas prices are rising.  This is due to pricing from refineries. Learn how an industry works before you comment on it you MORON. #trumpfail
6869 2018-07-05 13:18:45 Oklahoma used have 13 refineries. Now it has five. More refineries to Louisiana & Texas along Gulf coast. Still a lot of oil & gas here.
6870 2018-07-05 13:18:38 The central government  raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a lit and that on diesel by 13.47 a lit in nine installments between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October 2017 by Rs 2 a lit
6871 2018-07-05 13:18:38 Hey @SenMikeLee, yesterday we took a stroll on #PublicLands and picked some ripe raspberries and enjoyed the scenic river, but I'm sure it'd totally be nicer as low income housing or an oil well.

6885 2018-07-05 13:17:46 Mr President
IRAQ SHOULD GIVE THEIR OIL TO US FOR FREE.
ONE OF OUR BRAVE HEROS THAT LOST THEIR LIVES OVER THERE IS WORTH MORE THAN THEIR WHOLE UNAPPREACIATIVE 
COUNTRY. What's the reason we don't use our own oil?
IT WOULD BE NICE TO TELL OPEC
TO GO POUND SALT--
6886 2018-07-05 13:17:45 Yup. And worse. A lot of these children were sent ahead by their parents, without their parents, knowing the risk of rape, death, and “full-on” danger, ...ICE is saving the day!! AND THEIR LIVES!!!
6887 2018-07-05 13:17:43 No way. Pre tournament friendlies and all games I've seen him in shows he's slow, always caught out of position and has the turn of an oil rig. Not good enough for our reserves!
6888 2018-07-05 13:17:30 Mr. POTUS - It's been that way - OPEC controlling world prices
on oil since I can remember.. That's the big reason for our oil 
independence - to get from under the iron hand of OPEC.

6894 2018-07-05 13:16:20 The death toll in Quebec is now 17; more than the Broncos from the Bus Crash earlier this year. Climate Change Denials are not getting it. However, our Scientists do, & continue to warn us. We need a plan that conserves oil; not waste it out our tail pipes.
6895 2018-07-05 13:16:15 @realDonaldTrump so we are going to “buy American” until it comes to oil??? Buying from the Middle East only helps their economy...not ours. Many families and businesses depend on oil and gas...don’t ever forget that.
6896 2018-07-05 13:16:03 Yeah and it was also what the market was buying that flatlined whale oil sales, but whatever you need to feel smart I guess.
6897 2018-07-05 13:15:59 My father: I don't care about Trump.

6898 2018-07-05 13:15:53 His point is partly true, the north sea and Alaska fields are declining. A better point is that if we literally do burn all the oil we'll be boiling ourselves alive.

6980 2018-07-05 13:08:15 You do know that world wide there is approximately 50 years worth of oil reserves? Time to invest heavily in alternative sources of energy.
6981 2018-07-05 13:08:12 Hey US, remember when Venezuela’s Chavez offered to supply needy Americans with free oil when world oil prices were ginormous? And what was the US response? Oh yes, it was to destabilize the Venezuelan economy. (Source: *Confessions...* by John Perkins)
6982 2018-07-05 13:08:07 Unfortunately one of the items that @realDonaldTrump has put tariffs on is gas. We ship our oil to the states to be refined into gas as we gave up that capacity in the 70’s and closed our refineries.

7012 2018-07-05 13:04:31 @realDonaldTrump every spring gas prices go up every year 100% of the time! In July they start to fall. Why don’t you temporarily suspend gasoline exports from our refineries or Oil exports? That will make our prices go way down.
7013 2018-07-05 13:04:30 You can blame yourself regarding the price of oil/gas
7014 2018-07-05 13:04:22 Is that why you said you wanted out of the Iran treaty? So you could broker a deal to change to Russian oil? Why did you send those Congresspeople to Russia on the 4th of July?  #TrumpsColludingWithTheEnemy
7015 2018-07-05 13:04:08 The government won't do anything because it's all down to money, oil and contracts.

7045 2018-07-05 13:01:49 The American people really appreciate you message to the oil producing countries to increas and boost their oil production. You are giving Americans a hand to stretch THIER budget. Means more money for food and for payments. Thanks a million for you great work.

7120 2018-07-05 12:55:02 Mary. Don’t worry there will be no fracking. There is no oil just water. UKOG is just another scam co from the Lenigas stable of many. It’s a Monaco lifestyle co. The fields will stay green for all the sheep he collects
7121 2018-07-05 12:55:01 You misunderstand. Love is the goal, as is peace and prosperity. The two parties work for the goals of the profitable elite industries like war and oil by manipulating us against each other. It's the responsibility of people to take back power we've been tricked into misplacing.
7122 2018-07-05 12:54:56 Too little. A one cent/gallon Carbon tax (Ghg release fine collected by treaty signers thru tax & import duty) could raise $91 billion in one year. The oil companies and dirty energy users need to pay! Signers keep half to pay debt, bypass dirty technology. Cool Gaia & save ocean

7124 2018-07-05 12:54:47 Soco has no ops in Africa. Their recent sale to Coastal was of offshore licences over 1000 miles away from Virunga. Oil Quest appears to have been given a Virunga licence by DRC, 3 years after Soco relinquished theirs. Oil Quest are the people to contact.

7128 2018-07-05 12:54:22 Will never cease to amaze me that climate change-deniers would rather listen to/believe propaganda from oil companies and people who represent fossil fuel interests in general than actual scientists
7129 2018-07-05 12:54:21 If investment was increased in Canada (which has the 3rd largest oil reserves) together with USA, North America could control world oil pricing instead of OPEC & their despots & dictators.

7136 2018-07-05 12:53:49 Why aren't we using some of our own oil reserves to lower these prices what are we saving it for? Why are we doing all this fracking and why do we build and building all these pipelines for all this oil Reserve and we're not using it?

7139 2018-07-05 12:53:21 He just wants to steal Tillersons oil reserves.
7140 2018-07-05 12:53:17 Climate change is cyclical, look at carbon isotopes from ice core records. Every 10-20k years there is a period of dramatic heating and cooling. Get over it. #UKOG #oil #fracking
7141 2018-07-05 12:53:14 I just can't seem to get to the article due to circling advertising.  I assume trump wanted to just go in and take control of the oil.  Probably one of Putin's ideas.
7142 2018-07-05 12:53:14 Gas prices in the States set the prices in Latin America as well. That being the case, prices have to come down. Motions are already being taken causing more monthly and yearly peaks in inflation all caused in said part by oil prices at the pump.

7151 2018-07-05 12:52:15 “Trump demands OPEC lower oil costs”

...that’s ADORABLE.

For his follow up act, I suppose he’ll demand that the Sun “lowers the brightness” from 2-5PM for his nap.
7152 2018-07-05 12:52:11 It's a shame that we embargoed one of the largest oil producing countries
7153 2018-07-05 12:51:57 When you pour 60 billion into the US system for transnational producers to produce “cheaper” oil you get a “cheaper” at pump cost. Americans still pay the same rates if not higher than Canadians ... when the cost of subsidy is factored in

7175 2018-07-05 12:48:59 What a fool! Because that's how oil prices are determined.  The US demands price reduction.  Guess he has never purchased gas overseas! He would know we already pay less than the rest of the world!

7184 2018-07-05 12:48:08 An example is the wonderful system of direct planting oil seed rape (canola) after a cereal, with application of fertilizer only along the line of sown seeds. Fertilizer use is much reduced and, with intact soil structure, run off is reduced as well!
7185 2018-07-05 12:48:03 What are friends for though only if it is with a good intention. What we've learnt is that many countries who talked like this is doing so because of the oil, other natural blessings since the owner have failed to utilize it
7186 2018-07-05 12:48:00 Oil comes from ancient plants, not dinosaurs.
7187 2018-07-05 12:47:40 Oil pricing doesn't work like that, fool! Your changing our laws to allow our producers to sell on the open market caused high prices, dummy! #LiaGate

7192 2018-07-05 12:47:08 This is an opportunity for countries already involved in negotiating an end to the Syria conflict to focus better on ending the fighting and supporting rebuilding efforts that equally distribute the costs of stabilization between the many oil rich countries of the middle east

7194 2018-07-05 12:47:03 Yeah I should probably admit defeat and buy something like that, or just remember to take some coconut oil with me bc that helps! As if I haven't got enough to think about 
7195 2018-07-05 12:46:58 Mr. President, it’s time to open the spigots on domestic production! More oil = lower prices and fewer $$ going into OPEC’s hands. Unlike the ‘70s, our domestic production can now control market prices and force OPEC to either meet us in the middle or suffer the consequences!
7196 2018-07-05 12:46:51 Well, they should have thought about that before they found oil. (insert winkie emoji here)
7197 2018-07-05 12:46:43 And he’d be even more wrong than his original position. Lol
7198 2018-07-05 12:46:42 So you complain about working so hard to block Gay friendly Oil?  What about the  being tossed off buildings in dictator regimes?  The same regimes that benefit from obstruction of Canadian oil, you help sell their #bloodoil. @YEGPride @MikeSmythNews @ctvedmonton
7199 2018-07-05 12:46:39 You should NOT be putting oil of any type down a drain. The correct place is in a container and dispose of via your local household waste recycling centres or trade waste collection services. Cooking oils and fats should be collected and recycled into bio-fuels.

7259 2018-07-05 12:40:58 They pay about 65% taxes. The government isn’t all you think it is. Read up on it. They also have oil reserves that adds to wealth. They aren’t having enough kids and already fear the imbalance is coming because they need the tax dollars.
7260 2018-07-05 12:40:48 oh i see, you like foreign oil? That's what has cost us trillions of dollars, and senseless wars
7261 2018-07-05 12:40:37 Oh, let's not forget international corporations, oil & gas companies, banks, and other powerful groups who benefit from Nigeria's divide.
7262 2018-07-05 12:40:31 I’d be careful making statements along the lines of “the UK needs the US, not the other way round” - you’d be surprised how 2-way the need really is... One of the US’s biggest oil companies for example - BP, British Petroleum.
7263 2018-07-05 12:40:31 Even when you heat your house with oil????? 
7264 2018-07-05 12:40:26 The only way to keep gas prices low in America is to have more refineries in to keep more of our domestic oil production here. @potus @realDonaldTrump

7289 2018-07-05 12:37:18 Hey, I'm no Trump University genius, but aren't gas prices more affected by the ability to refine oil. Our capabilities are down due to hurricane damage. Since gas is a perishable item, you can't create and store a surplus. You might want to read a book.

7311 2018-07-05 12:34:37 I don't think you understand the oil market. Iran sanctions take all their output out, so that 1 million b/d increase OPEC and Russia agreed to, isn't actually going to happen. Summer demand also drives them higher. You tweet your anger at OPEC when oil was $140/b? I'll guess no.

7316 2018-07-05 12:34:13 2. There's a wealth of psychological research showing this. The recent case of Billy Caldwell whose fits are controlled by cannabis oil illustrates it.

7329 2018-07-05 12:32:59 Yeah state ownership is that bad Norways state owned oil has produced a 1TRILLION wealth fund while Maggie Thatchers sell off of BP cost us 400 BILLION. The sell off of GAS is costing you higher bills the sell off of rail is costing u higher fares. Stockholm syndrome comes 2 mind
7330 2018-07-05 12:32:53 Strategic autonomy with Indian characteristics! Manmohan Singh's Government followed almost a similar course. It's got more to do with the difficulties that Indian refineries face in paying for the oil when the U.S. imposes sanctions.
7331 2018-07-05 12:32:43 Actually, oil and fossil fuel dependence makes energy independence much further away since they're finite resources, idiot.

7337 2018-07-05 12:32:00 Obama, while not an innocent angel, strengthened anti-trust law. Trump is dismantling it for his own benefit and that of his billionaire supporters/ business partners. As well as removing vital environmental protections established by Obama, for the benefit of the oil industry.
7338 2018-07-05 12:31:57 Remember the oil embargo. When it comes to oil, we have no friends. Stop exporting oil!  Another Stupid act by Congress!
7339 2018-07-05 12:31:38 @TheBodyShopUK can I ask how you open the silky camomile cleansing oil? Genuinely I twist the top and it never opens
7340 2018-07-05 12:31:37 So many people I know get fooled by the hyperbole written on labels to sell a product. READ THE INGREDIENTS and more importantly again, learn what the ingredients themselves are. Still so many believe canola oil is a good choice 
7341 2018-07-05 12:31:24 Yeah I am sure Iran wants lower oil price #rhetoric
7342 2018-07-05 12:31:20 Hiya Lou, DM us to let us know where to send you a free sample of Crotch Guard Anti-Chafing Skin Care Oil...
7343 2018-07-05 12:30:57 Your clearly stuck in 2015.  The US exports oil to Canada and will be the largest producer in the world by 2019 surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.  Good luck with cap and trade the commies in the south tried that on us.
7344 2018-07-05 12:30:55 If we have surpassed oil output of the Saudis and are rivaling the output of Russia, why we not setting our own prices.  And keep it here stop exporting refined products.

7347 2018-07-05 12:30:46 Indeed. Thatcher choose the EU. Thatcher choose to unbalance the economy then exploited by Blair and Brown. WW2, the oil producers getting wise, the coal miners getting cocky, all produced Thatcher. Thatcher produced the conditions that gave the post 2008 UK deficit. Reactionary
7348 2018-07-05 12:30:44 It should also be clear from this tweet that I...
A ) Don't really understand OPEC at all.
B ) I think that I can drive oil prices down by making veiled threats at the OPEC member nations.
C ) I'm a absolute dick.
7349 2018-07-05 12:30:38 Con la complicazione che il prezzo, in funzione dell’indice oil come descritto da @il_monteveglio, non era una retta ma una spezzata, il che rese interessante l’hedging del margine quando i mercati europei di vendita finale furono liberalizzati e si disaccoppiarono dai prezzi oil

7358 2018-07-05 12:30:00 The people who r questioning the state should have questioned the Center first as they kept price high even at low crude oil price. Atleast they hav given huge relaxation 4 farmers with 34000 crore. N even 2% increase still karnataka is behind many states in price

7365 2018-07-05 12:29:27 Can you put #TrumpTariffs on foreign oil

to encourage USA oil production?

The USA could become ENERGY INDEPENDENT

#MAGA
7366 2018-07-05 12:29:14 The pros of both are it’s your skin trying to balance out! I found oil cleansing helped to balance it out more especially with black cumin seed oil, sounds weird but it worked! Evening primrose helps balance out hormones for women which can help too taken as a supplement.
7367 2018-07-05 12:29:14 oh itu laa i dont really mind abt that sbb for scars i mmg pakai bio oil, serum saja saja nak menambah 
7368 2018-07-05 12:29:12 Or what trump. Wasn't this your doing in the first place? Didn't you and oil men buddies tell them to,slow down production, so you guys could get higher price per barrel. Media get this story straight.
7369 2018-07-05 12:29:09 私のことを嘘つき呼ばわりしたうえに、自分のyoutubeチャンネルで事実であったことを都市伝説とまで言い切った葬儀屋のツイートがTLに現われてきたので、PCを爆破しました！

7371 2018-07-05 12:29:05 Regardless of your opinion on #UKOG Health & Safety should over ride all. People should not be slow walking tankers filled with oil or lorries laden with heavy equipment on a B road with fast moving traffic. If we need an injunction to stop this from happening then so be it.
7372 2018-07-05 12:29:05 Jason, if you aren’t aware, we need oil. That need is not going away soon. If you want to give it up, go ahead and try.

7380 2018-07-05 12:28:17 How many cars they stole oil from for their hair??
7381 2018-07-05 12:28:17 looking at the layout here you could knock $5 off the oil price just by offering 100mm barrels of SPR with 18 month time to return barrels.

7387 2018-07-05 12:27:55 Abi asked me why I had Alfredo sauce in my shower. 

It’s coconut oil. 
7388 2018-07-05 12:27:47 With the issues we have due to refining petrol you don't expect our oil to sell less...It's good you cannot compare the prices to any other African countries including SA..And our neighbors but to other opec members..My point stands valid
7389 2018-07-05 12:27:38 Excuse me almost Dr Hi, but we have not imported any oil from Iran since 1979 when they held our embassy staff hostage, I know, I was there for from the very beginning and unlike you have followed the destructive path of the Mulla's ever since.

7391 2018-07-05 12:27:32 Ur Absolutely right! Oil company shareholders ought to fight those oil wars. They r the profiteers afterall!
7392 2018-07-05 12:27:30 If China economy keeps dropping and devaluing will they still be able to be the largest oil consumer nation and will oil producers keep accepting Renminbi?
7393 2018-07-05 12:27:19 My grandpa picked up my car this morning, got me four new tires and changed my oil... he is seriously the only man I need in my life 
7394 2018-07-05 12:27:18 Trump: You think that OPEC will drop prices because you tweet. How about a threat of reigning down fire and fury on their oil price increase? Wake up Trump! Release some of our own oil reserves to ease prices at home. Warn Saudi’s you’ll stop arms sales until they cut Oil prices!
7395 2018-07-05 12:27:17 I'll keep that in mind. Btw what's the treatment for cancer, should people see an oncologist or just chug jojoba oil?

The Portland will be tested for 30-45 days. That’s 30-45 days of oil tankers seen leaving the site. 30-45 days of potential rises.

One of Iran’s biggest oil buyers said it has enough alternative sources of crude to replace any supplies cut off by U.S. sanctions on the Persian Gulf state
7402 2018-07-05 12:27:01 Oh shit my bad son  they are starting me off at the great Texas oil change then once I get my license I’ll move into the shop.
7403 2018-07-05 12:26:54 CRUDE OIL

Crude oil price will fall when Deutsche Bank makes margin call to Glencore, which means when the Federal Reserve makes margin call on Deutsche Bank.

For Trump to achieve lower oil price, Fed would have to act.
7404 2018-07-05 12:26:43 Oil would have been lower if Putin tweeted
7405 2018-07-05 12:26:43 If a rupee or two can end the miseries of farmers it a welcome move. When we can pay for the undesired taxes leived inspite of low crude oil prices than why not for our Anna daata!!

Proverbs 5:3-4 

Deception is brutal to the senses. Be guarded today. May we not be lulled to sleep by her ways! Make war!
7409 2018-07-05 12:26:16 1) They remember.
2) They control the supply...not the price.
3) Do you understand how the trading works on the oil?
4) This is why many people have said we need to focus on alternative fuel sources for decades now.
5) Have a safe trip to Russia! 
7410 2018-07-05 12:26:11 If only you had stayed in the Iran nuclear deal oil prices would be low.  Don't blame OPEC the blame falls squarely on your shoulders. NO ONE ELSE IS TO BLAME BUT YOU.
7411 2018-07-05 12:26:07 Do we know why these people were selected to attend this meeting?  I find it interesting that all are Senators except for Kay Granger (rep in TX - Ft Worth).  Rosneft Oil discussion perhaps?

7414 2018-07-05 12:25:47 USA now exports more oil than 12 of the 14 OPEC countries. Maybe the world (and world economy) is not as simple as POTUS see it.
7415 2018-07-05 12:25:40 The US is exporting oil. Helping to make up for the shortfall. Thank you POTUS for putting us in the position to do so.

There are so many charge stations in my area I can’t wait!! And no more oil changes!!!
7419 2018-07-05 12:25:24 I recognize the value in removing $ from companies making negative environmental impacts but a lot of places don’t have that privilege. There are entire natural history museums that might not exist without oil company donations (e.g Sam Noble, MNS Houston).

7436 2018-07-05 12:23:59 Transitions are so uncomfortable. You are pressed. You are crushed. Have confidence in knowing that Olives are crushed to produce olive oil. Coals are pressed to make diamonds. Moral of the story even though the process is ugly and messy, but end results are beautiful

You want to harm Canadian jobs and such just because of the need to throw a tantrum? If you had a REAL job, you might not do childish stunts like this. What a JOKE.

7451 2018-07-05 12:21:49 This baby oil is the only thing making me look like a real person today. And this Taco Bell breakfast I’m about to get.
7452 2018-07-05 12:21:43 A big part of the reason that oil prices are continuing to rise is that we’re seeing more supply issues slow production, and oil traders are responding to that. Venezuela, Libya, and Nigeria have all had problems with producing oil this year. #oott

7455 2018-07-05 12:21:35 Yes, it would be helpful to hear your thoughts on this.  What are the other mechanisms that could be used when a vote by the parliament was ignored? The only other that comes to mind is Sanallah can stop directing oil revenues to the CBL, which is problematic on a host of levels.
7456 2018-07-05 12:21:34 I went to get a packet of biscuits to take to work for my night shift but they all had palm oil in them. Palm oil has no place in biscuits or peanut M&Ms for that matter #PalmOil #orangutan #deforestation shame on you @McVities @cadbury @ChocoMars

7466 2018-07-05 12:20:50 Complete propaganda bo**ocks. They need Russia to join the Eurasian Union and are looking for any reason to cause anti Russian sentiment. Just like the lie of WMD in Iraq...but now they have the oil and a subservient 'leader' to the Global Agenda.
7467 2018-07-05 12:20:50 Bullshit. He is attempting to hamstring the future of our energy infrastructure because Russia needs the oil revenue, and your daddy is a puppet to Putin.

7472 2018-07-05 12:20:16 You CAN compare butter vs. coconut oil vs. extra-virgin oil. 
They're ALL foods. 
In my opinion butter is the best (nutritional profile)

Your reasoning should be improved by answering that. You have power to read.

I sell luxury oil fragrances...designer perfumes in their unadulterated oil forms....these oils are pure with no alcohol content so they last longer than the alcohol infused perfumes... you can smell so amazing with as little as 3500.
7524 2018-07-05 12:15:32 Tea Tree or Lavender oil should soothe the itch  #remedies
7525 2018-07-05 12:15:20 I'm definitely buying this Arami Glow oil, the packaging looks amazing.

7528 2018-07-05 12:15:06 Watch those oil prices rise super high the closer to Trump being exposed. This was part of the RU plan. Tundra melting, oligarchs get bug investment returns, RU sells us oil.
7529 2018-07-05 12:15:05 #Iran threatens to disrupt regional oil shipping, if #Iranian oil sales were banned by the #US, after which US promises to keep those very waterways open.
7530 2018-07-05 12:14:53 @nadiratudor Was one of the major most Contraversial rows over UK mishandling of nuclear pollution and damaged its environmental credentials internationally until 1995 case over aborted attempt to dispose of disused oil rig in North Sea that caused a big row with Germany then
7531 2018-07-05 12:14:47 In other Trade War News: 
Iran threatens to block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if the U.S. bans Iranian oil sales. $WTIC

Eurozone has other issues too: #Brexit meeting to decide their final economic plan.  ECB looks to raise sooner than Dec ‘19. $FXE
7532 2018-07-05 12:14:18 Hey, didn't he make a phone call to get oil prices lowered — and then yesterday, complain that they weren't lowered? What gives?
7533 2018-07-05 12:14:12 Kyle literally has an oil painting of himself with his unibrow and mustache and sideburns at his house and it’s amazing
7534 2018-07-05 12:14:06 そこらを見ていくと本当にヒトラーは扇動家として天才的だったんだなぁって思いますねー。また、ヒトラーが頭角を現すことがなくても他の人が同じことをしただろうって言うのも納得できるものが……ｗ

7536 2018-07-05 12:13:51 The people who r questioning the state should have questioned the Center first as they kept price high even at low crude oil price. Atleast they hav given huge relaxation 4 farmers with 34000 crore. N even 2% increase still karnataka is behind many states in price @RShivshankar
7537 2018-07-05 12:13:35 Mr.RG did you know,karntaka government hike the price of petrol and diesel while you promised in MP,if your govt will formed over there then you will reduced oil prices by RS.10. now it's shown double standard of you and your govt.ur govt made fool till 70yrs &it's continue..
7538 2018-07-05 12:13:21 Carnegie på Statoil: We stick to BUY and have raised our target price to NOK250 (230) ahead of the Q2 report as we have increased our Brent blend oil price estimate to USD75/bbl (72) for Q2(18), USD75/bbl(67) for H2(18) and USD70/bbl (67)for 2019 and beyond. $EQNR #EQNR #Statoil

7540 2018-07-05 12:13:02 Zero is fair and not up for any debate. If no one pays income taxes, the government loses (and that's ok). We've got enough guns to thwart any invasion attempt, enough oil to meet our needs, and can grow enough crops up Fed ourselves. Let's get back to basics and a small gov
7541 2018-07-05 12:13:00 Oil city things.... m3ntry!!!
7542 2018-07-05 12:12:50 Another savings for the initiative. We wouldn't have to send soldiers to protect the oil rich countries.
7543 2018-07-05 12:12:49 What is the problem that a Oil company cannot settle payment for over 24 months ...in September it will be three years
7544 2018-07-05 12:12:44 Have you ever heard of OPEC?  It’s kind of their thing to control global oil.  They also happen to hate YOU!  I see a correlation here.
7545 2018-07-05 12:12:43 If such 'Tantrik Babas' are so powerful&can see future,they shud help to explore oil&mineral deposits or way to cheap solar energy
7546 2018-07-05 12:12:39 Well... #data can be the oil we want, but we need the engine (#DataScience & #Analytics) to use it for benefit. It needs creativity and innovation to solve business problems and find new problems that organisations dont know exist.

7547 2018-07-05 12:12:39 Yeah yeah, them too. Especially the ones made with questionable oil that you get in the Hot Chips shops. But dang, who cares. So tasty ;-p
7548 2018-07-05 12:12:38 Precisely. But in this thread's universe the new meaning of "fossil fuel" is, conveniently enough, any thing that oil is used in production, no matter what the state of matter that product takes.
7549 2018-07-05 12:12:34 The last time we got involved in ‘escorting oil tankers’ in the Gulf the USS Stark was hit by an Iraqi Exocet missile killing 37 and wounding 21. Then we shot down an Iranian airliner killing 290 innocent people. Stay home like George Washington tried to tell us!
7550 2018-07-05 12:12:15 Enough of any oil should keep the eggs from sticking.
7551 2018-07-05 12:12:06 Oil Workers are notorious roaches. Can't count the number of times one has said "We're getting divorced, we just haven't filed the paperwork yet but we see other people". @BMS_Derek @BMS_Billy @BMS_Nard

7560 2018-07-05 12:11:25 It’s more or less throw everything in a pot and let it simmer, you just take some time between steps

Making a roux is the hardest bit really and it’s just flour and oil in equal parts, then you mix really thoroughly and cook until it looks like chocolate

7570 2018-07-05 12:10:04 Have placed an order with @FushiWellbeing It’s so important to use good quality oils. I’ll be making a DIY hemp body butter, using castor oil/ black cumin for oil cleansing and argan for moisture. All great for inflammation,dry skin and offering relief. Perfect for eczema!

7572 2018-07-05 12:09:57 Some of it is still taking off. Its just the Resource dependent ones with no active industrial strategy like Nigeria and South Africa that were burned.

Nigeria's curse is oil. If it had never been found the country would have been better off.

7580 2018-07-05 12:08:50 Which is why we must harness that energy and remove ourselves from gas, oil etc.  We can do this

7584 2018-07-05 12:08:31 They say this and that oil is stable.  I don't concur.

7591 2018-07-05 12:07:54 Heftar's move, while controversial, confronts one of the most serious issues Libya faces. The militias are an existential threat to the future of libya.

7601 2018-07-05 12:06:18 How about development of alternative fuels?  There’s only so much oil left. Want to have something to be remembered by?  Besides pee videos?
7602 2018-07-05 12:06:02 Why is money from Oil Majors dishonest? Is there any suggestion they are leaning on the Science Museum to green wash oil?

7610 2018-07-05 12:05:09 No, in capital intensive industries like energy (particularly nuclear, oil & gas) project life is about 25 years. So, for a new tech to displace an existing tech, it must deliver significant financial advantages - and it still takes between 25 and 50 years.

7623 2018-07-05 12:03:55 If the conversation between Trump & Putin was about oil, why would Trump insist on been alone with Putin with no record of what was said. If that was a Dem President the Rs would prosecute him for treason.

7629 2018-07-05 12:03:05 You're delusional to think Scotland needs the UK. If anything Thatcher and beyond can be thankful for all the Scottish oil revenues we produced in the 80s and 90s towards helping them give tax cuts to the rich in the rest of the UK. We're not subsidised, now away.

7650 2018-07-05 12:00:24 That’s really good to know, thanks. Going out to eat hasn’t been enjoyable because we don’t know the level of the allergy so peanut oil could be a problem but if could be totally fine and many places use it.

7655 2018-07-05 11:59:53 Ugandan Mps are spoilt old machines with no oil
7656 2018-07-05 11:59:15 Plenty evidence to say we would be well placed as a small independent nation, equivalent to many others in the EU for instance. We have a strong economy, food, tourism, oil (even tho it's 'running out' big companies are still discovering & opening new fields), renewables etc.

7659 2018-07-05 11:58:54 Oil and Water
7660 2018-07-05 11:58:51 East anglia did not! Neither did Paris say that we will get 25m even if we go neutral yesterday they were rather equivocal? The oil and coal companies will make more money for a while!
7661 2018-07-05 11:58:50 oil. Man wakes up from a coma.  From live food drink.  Sprouted almonds,  coconut meat and water,  1 bunch celery,  1 bunch parsley,  1 bunch cilantro,  1 cucumber,  apples,  himalayan salt.  Consume 30% less live 30% longer
7662 2018-07-05 11:58:48 He just wants the oil.
7663 2018-07-05 11:58:42 Do they have oil? We're happy to visit backward, dirty Islamic countries if there's oil.

7668 2018-07-05 11:58:14 Oligarchs need big returns on their oil investments made with illegal loans that are about to be called.
7669 2018-07-05 11:57:36 Banks nervous of #lithium oversupply will lose opportunity to new wave of project financiers: Omani State interest in Bacanora for Sonora Project (oil & gas money); SoftBank - Nemaska shows Tech space interest; BP added lithium price to its World Energy Report - shows mainstream.
7670 2018-07-05 11:57:35 Not for Nigeria, APC government and tyrant Muhammandu Buhari. The facts and records are abundantly available there for the world to see. Thus, #Biafra for Referendum, as water & oil can never mix #BIAFRAREFERENDUM from evil Nigeria.
7671 2018-07-05 11:57:33 What makes you think that you can scream & shout like a 2 year old & get what you want? Oil prices have been low for a long time. They are still way below where they were 5 years ago when they peaked at $130/barrel. You just don’t want Americans to blame you for price rises.
7672 2018-07-05 11:57:26 Yes they become rich enough to import wood and forest products and stuff that destroys forests uch as palm oil.
7673 2018-07-05 11:57:15 Now onto the first #OFEOAG panel, where @JamesElston3, Ross Glover, Alan Linn and Matt Cartright are discussing the benefits that onshore oil and gas can and are bringing to our economies, local and national.

7679 2018-07-05 11:56:16 Russians have been bribing Republicans for decades. WSJ just ran a story on Bob Dole receiving over $300k in 2003 alone from Putin's righthand man - the same oil baron who Paul Manafort owed tens of millions and was, among other things, connected to the Trump Tower meeting.

7683 2018-07-05 11:55:47 If wages were such an issue, then you would expect a fully automated oil terminal to have some positive effect on the price of petrol,,,,,but not so, the main reason for hanging on to fossil fuel is the economic structure of the industry,,,,the other arguments are just salesman
7684 2018-07-05 11:55:38 I wish unfortunately for me I’m not pals with CC so no insider info unlike our nomad who was shorting us or the saviours that we’re quick to exit while our CEO was telling us all was good when pg11 had a tool stuck...  can only hope the oil and the deeper zones attract someone
7685 2018-07-05 11:55:37 punishment that my mom set an oil change appointment for 8am? u tell me
7686 2018-07-05 11:55:20 How are they going to get the oil over the wall?

7691 2018-07-05 11:54:37 I prefer this option than buying vegan products that travel through so they polluate our earth and are made mainly with Palm oil which kill Orangutan
7692 2018-07-05 11:54:26 The smell of tanning oil reminds me of holiday
7693 2018-07-05 11:54:08 Why would any American want to visit a Muslim shithole unless there's oil there?
7694 2018-07-05 11:54:06 Plus, oligarchs invested in oil years ago with illegal loans that are about to be called. They need the most from their investments.
7695 2018-07-05 11:54:05 .@realDonaldTrump should beware. Claiming credit for this boom in various ways (jobs, markets, etc) and believing that it's his bully pulpid (#oil, #trade) which control markets (i.e. oil prices), will land him in a position where he appears helpless (i.e. inflation) and 2 blame.
7696 2018-07-05 11:53:51 Oil and gas is so easy.
7697 2018-07-05 11:53:46 Your obsession with coal is blinding you to the overall energy transition that is underway. When we moved from wood to charcoal and then coal, emissions (per unit of energy) fell. Same with oil, gas, nuclear and hydro. There is a clear 'decarbonisation' trend, continues with PV.
7698 2018-07-05 11:53:45 So in other words, his oil got changed but not yours?
7699 2018-07-05 11:53:43 You are mixing oil and water now my cic, by doing so you will be allowing politics to play a role in our tradition and heritage as africans.

7701 2018-07-05 11:53:22 @TeflonGeek Pro oil/coal/gas Trump has adopted economic, environmental and foreign policy contributing significantly to the rise in oil prices.  Trump foolishly supports a bankrupt energy model.  We need a leader who will promote clean energy.
7702 2018-07-05 11:53:17 Edi sana sya nalang gumawa. Kailangan lang pala nya simple eh. Haha mang aabala pa ng tao, gagamitan ng utak at time ng artist para san? Sa shoutout? 
7703 2018-07-05 11:53:16 My purse broke on the way to my car and when I went to take the trash out I realized a beehive has formed so I wrote a message on the recycling bin for the garbage men to pls grab the trash from the side and I taped it with my oil change sticker. So far, great morning
7704 2018-07-05 11:53:13 That radical oil spray can be used outside too it’s Afa good  or u meaning one with SPF in it haha?
7705 2018-07-05 11:53:08 Mustard or pesto made with olive oil are healthy alternatives to mayonnaise. Make the switch today
7706 2018-07-05 11:53:08 Plus, if @realDonaldTrump wants to drive down the price of OPEC oil, have US companies ramp up production. It gets them every time when we buy less of their Middle East oil.
But trump is too stupid to understand trade economics.

7709 2018-07-05 11:52:49 He NEEDS oil prices to rise. This way RU can sell us oil. Plus oligarchs invested in oil with illegal loans. Need big returns.

7713 2018-07-05 11:52:26 Wake ! Action ! Prices went up because of your tweet , invade Iran , take over the oil fields , do something smart
7714 2018-07-05 11:52:25 As a Calgarian, I find the backlash against tech companies like Facebook and YouTube similar to the heat the oil and gas industry has faced over the last decade or so. #yyc
7715 2018-07-05 11:52:12 I don't know for sure, but i guess that butter is way superior to coconut oil.
7716 2018-07-05 11:52:09 The only reason that US can invades Venezuela is not humanitarian reason, not friendly, or because his good heart, the reason is "OIL" no other,US invasion has a purpose no matter who left behind,falls or dies. has a canal, military base or has OIL. that's what's ISIS fights too.

7719 2018-07-05 11:51:54 Because the oil barons hate you and they must serve their masters.

7724 2018-07-05 11:51:03 Absolutely! Why don't people see this. Russia has oil to sell us. Plus oligarchs invested in oil with illegal loans that are about to be called.

7726 2018-07-05 11:51:02 Any hippy shop that sells essential oil, you can blend it into massage or Bath oil, or put it in a diffuser. My fav thing for the old moon days!
7727 2018-07-05 11:50:58 He just removed oil from common man  and made himself safe and become a hero for farmers. Transferred common man to wave off farmers loan. what does he will do if crops hit again? Is waving off loan is only solution?

7730 2018-07-05 11:50:46 It's always been relatively pricy, the oil shot it up
7731 2018-07-05 11:50:41 It's too late. They're already under your bed. The call is coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE. Or you're just snake oil hucksters, trying to frighten the elderly, uninformed and gullible.

7733 2018-07-05 11:50:20 They picked a wholly unethical head of the EPA because that was where a huge amount of deregulation would give the most bang for their bucks.  Oil, gas, fracking, climate change, automobile industries, drinking water on and on. They could count on him for a lot of future profits
7734 2018-07-05 11:50:17 Always blame it on crude oil shortage. Petrol is getting stupid , gone are the days of £30 a tank, was £45 for 30L which did me for enniskillen.
7735 2018-07-05 11:50:16 You have to get an essential oil diffuser. Helps you sleep and keeps those stupid mosquitoes away. Lavender and citronella are life!

The USA needs to stop this BS of Regime change for OIL and MYOB
7738 2018-07-05 11:49:56 #ukog Eco lunatics, stop being hypocrites by using your electronic devices made of oil to say 'keep it in the ground'.
7739 2018-07-05 11:49:54 The once so great leader @realDonaldTrump has turned into a beggar for lower oil prices, what a joke, and this clown must lead a trade war
Ofcourse is this beggar gone lose this war

7741 2018-07-05 11:49:52 地獄か？
7742 2018-07-05 11:49:50 You should put a tariff on OPEC oil and that should bring the price down, right Mr. Wharton School of Business?
7743 2018-07-05 11:49:45 I would say Iran’s location is a pretty big card. Also, the US wanting to eliminate all of their oil revenue gives them very little to lose.
7744 2018-07-05 11:49:44 退学
7745 2018-07-05 11:49:37 Yes more complex, the equivalent would be coconut oil. MCT oil is part of what's in coconut oil. So proper comparison would be to refine butter further and extract just one thing
7746 2018-07-05 11:49:35 Their so much sweet  crude oil in Massai Mara if they would allow America Oil Companies to drill then they all would be billionaires but Massai Elders prefer to preserve such rich land but given historical East Africa from diamonds to Garden of Eden

7748 2018-07-05 11:49:18 OPEC already said they were going to increase oil output but it wasn't due to any demands by Trump. But, you can bet he will take credit for it.
7749 2018-07-05 11:49:13 I recently saw Birol quoted saying oil/gas only few % global emissions, which presumably is the industrial process of extraction not end use of the fuel for energy. Similar creativity, no?
7750 2018-07-05 11:49:12 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
7751 2018-07-05 11:48:54 Oil research will win this battle.

7753 2018-07-05 11:48:35 Funny how Mike has a twitter handle. That must mean he has a smart phone. Which  sure he knows is made with OIL products.
Go find something to really protest Mike. Like why Americans are hunting Giraffes.
7754 2018-07-05 11:48:35 Canopy Growth Corp. $CGC reaches a major supply agreement with the Alberta Gaming, Liquor & Cannabis Commission to supply  premium cannabis products  including whole-flower, oil, and Softgel capsules.
7755 2018-07-05 11:48:19 How about slapping the US oil companies.  They have shut down operations to cause supply shortages. They said they can't make money with oil at $25 to $30 a barrel but still post BILLION DOLLAR QUARTERLY EARNINGS.  Then they want to blame opec

7758 2018-07-05 11:48:12 What a negotiator you are - if I were OPEC I would cut more production just to insult you.   What happened to your "eminent domain" speech ... where are the pipelines to get the US oil out of the fracking locations?
7759 2018-07-05 11:47:58 I felt it in Crawley, the house seemed to wobble, my leg did too! Does this & other recent reported tremors have anything to do with all the oil drilling around the Surrey area? I read that an epicentre last week was at Stan Hill nearby to the Horse Hill site.
7760 2018-07-05 11:47:49 What about free markets?  I thought that was one of the tenets of the GOP. Shouldn’t oil companies be allowed to charge what the market will bear? Or are only US companies allowed to do that?
7761 2018-07-05 11:47:45 Yes, more oil than any OPEC nation, it's believed.
7762 2018-07-05 11:47:44 Oil sustains the Nigerian economy. A rapid transition to a non oil economy would make the situation worse. The gulf states get it, they are diversifying quite quickly?
7763 2018-07-05 11:47:41 We're told to report suspicious activity. But when you do, you're bad.
7764 2018-07-05 11:47:40 หรือจะยื่นสหเวชด้วยดีอ่ะ
7765 2018-07-05 11:47:38 I've been on on a lot of automated industrial sites - the most automated being an oil terminal on the Mersey. Only six on site each shift. But, with three shifts a day (24-hour operation) numbers still add up.
7766 2018-07-05 11:47:38 There is a woman on Radio 2 talking about eating flying ants as a delicacy, fried in oil

7770 2018-07-05 11:47:18 Trump NEEDS oil prices to rise. It's fake outcry. Oligarchs invested in oil with loans that are about to be called. Plus, RU has oil to sell us. Wake up!
7771 2018-07-05 11:46:50 Optics-shmoptics.

Oil money smells great! Even in rubles.
7772 2018-07-05 11:46:46 For their oil of course.
7773 2018-07-05 11:46:35 Trump or the US can not do anything about OPEC!  They can control the US by cutting off our oil supply, they have the power not Trump.
7774 2018-07-05 11:46:31 Worked 42 years on the oil industry. This is NOT how it works. The uneducation of this maggot is astounding.

7776 2018-07-05 11:46:16 Maybe gas prices will come down if Republican’ts put the restrictions they lifted from export of domestic oil back in place?
That helped big oil not the little people
#Resist
7777 2018-07-05 11:46:05 it was good. well done @BBCRadio4 for a well-balanced debate that also recognised urgent need to act on climate. One point @BishManchester was mistaken on - the main financial risk to Big Oil is not just "green start ups" but monoliths like Apple, Google, and car companies
7778 2018-07-05 11:45:53 So what is the correct geopolitical response by the US to Russia? We cant ignore them. Especially with oil supplies front and center.
7779 2018-07-05 11:45:51 Technology is now oil.

7786 2018-07-05 11:45:35 "The 14-member club of oil exporters is the textbook case of a successful cartel."
took that home bru! wuh, sounds like a colombiano cartel 
7787 2018-07-05 11:45:33 Very true. We have so much in Nigeria that we don't have business being poor least of all being listed as one of the poorest population in the world. Oil has made governors and people lasy and can't think out of the box. #ANigeria4All
7788 2018-07-05 11:45:32 We go lick Coal oil today.
7789 2018-07-05 11:45:27 I work in Texas oilfields occasionally. SMART oil producers are diversifying into wind, solar to ensure they remain viable & forward looking. The more dependent we become on our own energy sources, the less we are subject to booms/busts economically & better for national security
7790 2018-07-05 11:45:15 oh!! i put like a tiny bit of oil and maybe 1.5tbps or so of sugar on the dough too, whenever i make pizza it's just flour/water/salt/yeast but with reg bread bread i sometimes add them in
7791 2018-07-05 11:45:13 Fake. Gas prices are up because it's part of the RU plan. Oligarchs invested in oil with bank loans that are about to be called. Plus, RU has oil to sell us.
7792 2018-07-05 11:45:00 My girl did wonderful with the oil drops and chicken hemp treats. Wonderful
7793 2018-07-05 11:44:46 Got my nose coated in coconut oil to heal my sore skin and look like a greasy nutcase
7794 2018-07-05 11:44:43 just put oil in Lao's Indgen meat. now we wait.

7797 2018-07-05 11:44:26 @realDonaldTrump Natural Gas mandate for over the road trucks is a win win  for the US citizen. Gives us a new option for transport fuel, will drive oil down in price. Has international political implications that favor US. Do it now. We are Saudi Arabia of NG
7798 2018-07-05 11:44:03 @realDonaldTrump End oil speculation.  End speculation and/or futures of any natural resource today and prices will drop and stay natural, not inflated.  #duh #dotherightthing #makeanimpact

7803 2018-07-05 11:43:35 Check my oil, too!
7804 2018-07-05 11:43:21 Dummy, you said the states were self sufficient in oil.
What a lier.
7805 2018-07-05 11:43:03 Morning. Miss Bella survived the 4th I think the CBD oil helped her
7806 2018-07-05 11:43:03 ¿Alguien vio el comunicado del PIT-CNT repudiando el incremento de naftas y fuel oil y el consecuente aumento de TODOS los productos  de la canasta básica?
7807 2018-07-05 11:42:59 So fake. Trump NEEDS oil prices to rise. It's part of the RU plan. RU has oil they want to sell, plus oligarchs need a good return on their oil investments. Their loans are about to be called. Wake up America!
7808 2018-07-05 11:42:56 add oil bbu bbu

7813 2018-07-05 11:42:10 @realDonaldTrump make America produce MORE American’s OWN OIL and Reduce or eliminate our buying of foreign oils to zero. 
This way Americans do not have to pay for other countries oil games to play.

7820 2018-07-05 11:41:07 As per my concern the hike of oil prices globally impact the whole state/Nation instantly. because it'll effect the transportation cost, traveling cost, in many Areas farmers use diesel engine for irrigation will also adversely affected by this hike of oil price.

7821 2018-07-05 11:41:05 39 days from now, Kirani James Blvd. would look wider and bigger than usual... the road would get a nice coating of oil... the sheets would be jammed and so much SOCA would be playing..  Jouvert in 39

7824 2018-07-05 11:40:41 I’m interested. I believe we can be environmentally sustainable & competitive. Leaving a smog & oil covered country for our kids is not ok. Our cap & trade is lauded as the best globally. It’s shameful to throw it away. Our priorities are different. 52% of Ontario agrees with me.

7830 2018-07-05 11:40:14 5555
7831 2018-07-05 11:40:12 Last year, Kenya Power paid Sh22.1bn  for fuel costs, or 28% of its power purchase costs of Sh78.9bn. Since the cost of fuel is directly passed to consumers, they can expect their bills to remain high, particularly with the rise in global oil prices.

7833 2018-07-05 11:40:10 I think Nigel is as banal as the next guy. But this ‘oil’ talking point tend to suggest a lack of understanding of elasticity of demand? Or Schumpeter? Or, kinda, just markets and economics generally?

7846 2018-07-05 11:38:31 Hard to blame OPEC for gas prices when the US is exporting 75 percent of US oil.
7847 2018-07-05 11:38:27 They are what can only be described as - parasitic energy sources. Can only exist with back up from proven, traditional energy sources (Coal, Oil, Gas, Hydro, Nuclear). For Pete's sake, they even draw electricity from the grid when there's no wind. #NetNegative #Pretenergy
7848 2018-07-05 11:38:22 Public education has become the Standard Oil monopoly of our generation.  There must be a way to inject competition. The lack of genuine choices condemns our future to a box.

7865 2018-07-05 11:36:07 And not a word on oil..or I missed !!
7866 2018-07-05 11:36:05 The @VictoriaLIVE segment on Football Lads Alliance was scary, our media & politicians have embedded lies about immigration & Islam in to the psyche of the nation, now snake oil salesmen are leading the disenfranchised to fascism nirvana. Expect bad things

7873 2018-07-05 11:35:32 Other than oil rich middle eastern states with tiny populations Norway is the richest per capita country in the world.

7883 2018-07-05 11:34:51 Reaction due to political announcement or media attention usually takes time to hit harshly crude oil market; unless it carries a 100% degree of practical certainty 
7884 2018-07-05 11:34:24 I will once I get the next phase complete. Highlighting and shade. Going to drybrush the lot of them and then wash with Nuln Oil to darken the areas that I don't want highlighted.
7885 2018-07-05 11:34:03 Huh. Just checked online too and those herbs seem overkill imo. 3 parts olive oil to 1 part balsamic vinegar is good enough for me. Maybe add a little minced or grated garlic in the mix. I normally see it prepared like that so you can give it a go next time if you’d like.
7886 2018-07-05 11:33:48 Tara tara haha hm po pa change oil 
7887 2018-07-05 11:33:46 No I believe in the free market and the oil market is not as long as they are setting prices base on restricting supply.
7888 2018-07-05 11:33:46 The Bible mentions different gifts and different callings, listing many.  The Bible does not refer to most of the occupations that are currently performed by people.  Does their absence from the Bible mean that God did not call people to be chefs? Oil drillers? Programmers?
7889 2018-07-05 11:33:45 Avocado + Honey + Olive Oil
The fats and oils in avocado and olive oil are great for your hair 
The ingredients repair dry, brittle hair and protect your hair from further damage—a great option if you use hot tools often. The enzymes in the honey cause your hair to shine brighter

7893 2018-07-05 11:33:29 Ebi like them say “who’s the owner of star oil”
7894 2018-07-05 11:33:09 Does your pet shampoo do all of this? Mine does.  Jojoba oil moisturizes & softens fur while adding shine & luster to the coat.
Melaleuca Oil Soothes & nourishes skin while helping neutralize odors.
Odor neutralizing fragrance Eliminates pet odor instead of masking w/ perfume.
7895 2018-07-05 11:33:05 You stated that Saudi Arabia had promised to increase oil production in order to lower the price of oil. What happened? Great Negotiator--NOT. Great Liar--DEFINITELY.

7897 2018-07-05 11:32:50 The residents in my tiny stupid town are so nosy they literally just called the police on my car, which has been sitting in the driveway all night/morning because there's an oil mark on my bumper. 8:30 am. Police knocking on my door. Because of some oil on my fucking bumper.
7898 2018-07-05 11:32:49 Sounds like my week. Insane headache last night. Took some CBD oil and I was able to sleep at least.
7899 2018-07-05 11:32:35 Now they (Nomvula) tell us that more refineries will be built.
We want lampahla first; the oil reserves sold for next to nothing.

7902 2018-07-05 11:32:00 Since he's trying to BS you again #MAGA s, the oil price is determined by supply and demand, you know Capitalism? 
Of course OPEC can adjust their production and drive prices down, but you know what tho, they also have a National budget and need to make their $.
7903 2018-07-05 11:31:58 I'm sure this idea came from Putin - Venezuela is an oil state. 
Bonus - it's in Central America.
7904 2018-07-05 11:31:57 Try accidentally putting your finger in hot cooking oil. Its even funnier

7910 2018-07-05 11:31:31 Use our oil reserves inside US to bring prices down here at least! 
7911 2018-07-05 11:31:26 We are going for their oil.

7915 2018-07-05 11:31:15 Thanks Vito. If you think the shelf is likely to need protection from moisture (if it’s a place to place drinks) then it’s probably worth a coat of poly or varnish. If not then no need. Danish oil contains varnish so it will offer a bit of protection anyway
7916 2018-07-05 11:31:14 Another oily, greasy, and get the crudely oil to pay for it! Out of 43's #playbook. Yeah #Bolton is there now, he'll figure something out! #invasion for a #barrel, #Warmongers to free #Venezuela oil. The safe place for the  #Immigrants. I wouldn't be surprised.

7930 2018-07-05 11:30:14 Oil is going extinct, so we must diversify anyway. I'll do what needs to be done to extract the highest possible revenue from oil, however it will not be the primary source of inflow to this country in my administration. We've so many much more lucrative industries #ANigeria4All
7931 2018-07-05 11:30:05 I'd love to learn how to do oil painting bc I think I'd be awesome at it, but the cost and amount of chemicals you have to use put me off :/

7933 2018-07-05 11:29:50 Logic flaw as wind and solar are getting and will get cheaper it depends on infrastructure and bribes what 3rd world countries will do. The US has fought at least three aggressive wars this century about oil deny that any way you want!

7965 2018-07-05 11:27:17 It should not be the solution for farmers by any government.
one side to waive their loan and other hand hike the taxes on oil.
It may indirectly, but will effect even the poor section of society.
Absolutely poor budget for K'taka.

7966 2018-07-05 11:27:10 They have the most oil reserves as well, but the citizens can't afford gas, just like Canadians......We're almost there, keep up the good work Liberals!
7967 2018-07-05 11:27:05 This makes no sense at all, the only thing you get from this is to it's not the ANC it is the government (ANC) and RAF and CEF and PetroSA with all the levies etc and the US oil trade wars blame anyone of the above except the ANC, I would assume that was the objective of this.

The Coconut oil moisturises the hair instead of just coating the top layer. Jojoba oil is also a powerhouse for hydration. The peppermint essential oil is anti-inflammatory to soothe dandruff and itching. PS it smells amazing.

7988 2018-07-05 11:24:00 In UPA days our nation purchased oil from Iran inspite of western sanctions. Now our oil companies are running here & there to find other fuel sources before Nov 2018.Are we supposed to obey any nation rather than United nations sanction.what about our pride  @INCIndia
7989 2018-07-05 11:23:47 Happy birthday @oil_shaeikh

The same bikes that need oil to process tires & other bike parts. Cargo ships that need oil to ship bikes from China.

8003 2018-07-05 11:22:05 With all due respect, Mr. President, Operators and Contractors in the U.S. are all losing money. I am the CEO of Murchison Drilling Schools, and because of the low price of oil, training budgets have been slashed. We are struggling at these prices. We need oil prices to go up.
8004 2018-07-05 11:22:04 Next, pick and oil until golden and mustard seeds in the edges roll together then sandwich the leek, core and crispy.
8005 2018-07-05 11:21:57 Don’t see how it’s high risk, there’d have to be no oil anywhere to fail completely. Meanwhile trading is off the chart, and no one can deny that.
8006 2018-07-05 11:21:56 At first I wondered, because they're on the verge of collapse. But if I've learned one thing about this administration, it's not to trust them. What they would do there would end being a horrorshow. And if not oil, there would be something else in it for these grifters.
8007 2018-07-05 11:21:55 What is the position of America in this.? I once heard that Bush & Cheney own the largest private oil production company outside of the Middle East, is this true? If so then rising oil prices would benefit them.

Higher Healthcare prices...dollar weaker....stock mark down since Jan...do us all a favor..stick with fox
8073 2018-07-05 11:14:24 Rent is very high.
8074 2018-07-05 11:14:11 Make someothers fool.we know it was an action in response to US trade war.Then why you are not telling the fact that we will not be able to purchase Iranian oil from Nov19 due to sanction from  US.Where is our national pride & sovereignty gone ??That is also going to be history

(Using overripe bananas) The  potassium and natural oils in bananas soften the hair and prevent split ends and breakage, fixes brittle, damaged hair. Avocados are packed with vitamin B, helping hair growth and improves the strength of the hair.
8076 2018-07-05 11:13:56 OPEC Fights Back: Since its creation more than a half-century ago, OPEC has been jolting the world. The 14-member club of oil exporters is the textbook case of a successful cartel, wielding immense control over the world’s most critical commodity. As waves of new technologies..

8079 2018-07-05 11:13:30 MEPs aren't directly elected. You vote for the party not the person. UKIP got enough votes for him to get a seat and he's used it to bleed the system dry whilst doing as little work as he could ever since. Enjoy the snake oil.

8082 2018-07-05 11:13:28 6. A more complete resource on petroleum products would more completely shift demand away from crude oil. This is a much more effective approach than railing at a cartel for their cartel pricing.

8085 2018-07-05 11:13:26 Trump you f’n moron. 
It is this simple—oil is priced in US dollars (at least until you let China take over). The volatility of pathetic Trumpanomics is causing uncertainty... this uncertainty causes oil and gas prices to go up!

This is ALL trump’s fault!

8090 2018-07-05 11:12:43 Hey, could the Canadians we've offended with our little tariffs slap some on this pipeline since it originates in Canada? That might get some Congressional action when the oil puppetmasters start ringing up their cell phones about the Canadian tariffs.
8091 2018-07-05 11:12:38 It was all about controlling the oil.
8092 2018-07-05 11:12:36 The American President is stirring up trouble in a volatile #Oil market, by Iranian oil sanctions & tweets demanding OPEC to lower prices.

 Castor oil works wonders. Keep it away from your face or you'll get facial hair too.
8096 2018-07-05 11:12:04 Lol you say "oil no dey pay again"....oil still pays very well, just that then IT wasn't paying this good, best you could say is IT has started paying good....it isn't even close to paying as well as oil
8097 2018-07-05 11:12:00 That’s why these illiterates can’t complain when we have foreigners coming to work here while the likes of @MigunaMiguna  are exiled, when our oil is being exported crude because we can’t build a refinery it’s one thing to support England as a fan buts not as our ex abusers

8101 2018-07-05 11:11:36 Here's the thing, Donald. To the extent that you, as U.S. president, impact the oil market and fuel prices, you must do so through policy. Threats and demands will not work. I know those are the only tools in your "leadership" toolkit, but you have to learn to do better.
8102 2018-07-05 11:11:26 Pour the oil in nylon and maybe use it later.
8103 2018-07-05 11:11:24 Yep, I'm not against oil, I do know however that it will eventually run out, we keep cutting forest down, and

We are definately using oil well over 3x faster than we need to

8104 2018-07-05 11:11:13 But if Opec is producing more oil shouldn't  the crude oil prices be decreasing thus resulting a decrease in petrol plus since there will be an excess supply.

8126 2018-07-05 11:09:20 Only because oil prices have been low. Happens every cycle: low gas price prices > demand shift to SUV/Trucks > surge in oil demand > high gas prices > demand shift to cars, and on. This time as gas prices rise, however, demand will shift to $TSLA Model 3, instead of ICE cars.

8131 2018-07-05 11:08:54 No, Venezuela oil production tanked. Pushing prices up, also OPEC decisions to limit production also helped. POTUS has zero to do with oil prices or gas prices.

8155 2018-07-05 11:05:39 OPEC is playing the U.S. for suckers. If the OPEC countries  raise their oil prices on the U.S., then the U.S. should decrease funding, technology, manpower, in the  defense of those countries.
8156 2018-07-05 11:05:29 That's true. But. Opec is a tool. Like wall street. And the term..supply and demand.
All used to say why gas is up.  It's pure greed. 
Gas is a by Product of oil. And standard oil. Charges what it wants.   Not what is costs. To make..cause it's nothing.

8170 2018-07-05 11:03:34 #SAGhana Ramaphosa says the issue of energy came under discussion and Ghana has invited us to look at their oil and we want to ameliorate the impact of fuel increase, we get oil abroad and subjected to dollar pricing.

8211 2018-07-05 10:58:22 Yes, The Saudi's Just About Destroyed Our Oil And Gas Industry Here In The US. In A State That Refuses To Diversify Its Economy, It Took A Tremendous Hit When The Saudi's Kept The Barrel Price Of Crude Oil So Low It Put Many Families Out Of Work.

8213 2018-07-05 10:58:00 Would it not be more naturel to ask U.S. companies to lower their oil prices? After all U.S. is not importing a lot of OPEC oil.
8214 2018-07-05 10:57:54 The base likely thinks the US has the highest gas prices in the world and that OPEC is a monopoly. They also likely think that OPEC is the biggest source of imported oil to the US. All of these are false.
8215 2018-07-05 10:57:43 @folay09 If likes let it run deeper than oil well.The fact remains that men,women and children are dying. And we have no excuse
8216 2018-07-05 10:57:39 People still trip over to work for oil companies in Nigeria?

5 years ago, I know it used to be a #WeApplyAndDieHere situation for young graduates. But I’m amazed that this scenario still seems to be the case in 2018. 

I’d like to know why. Any thoughts? 
8217 2018-07-05 10:57:38 If gum trees seeped oil into river beds, virtually every waterway in Oz would shimmer. My money is that the oil came from the rotting corpse of a ripe croc kill in the vicinity #MasterChefAU
8218 2018-07-05 10:57:30 A carbon price will only be effective if its adopted worldwide though.  Otherwise, market forces will go to the lowest cost supplier.  The problem is that Canada wants to do this, but other oil exporters and major users do not.  This won’t work until they do.
8219 2018-07-05 10:57:28 Those better have some olive oil on them 
8220 2018-07-05 10:57:22 U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently called on OPEC producers  to help reduce oil prices, has raised prices through his tweets,  Iranian OPEC Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili was quoted as saying by  news agency SHANA on Thursday.

8222 2018-07-05 10:57:00 I will wait for the moment your oil just runs out. What were the former and currently Saudis Kings trying to do? Searching alternatives to oil. Out of Desperation? Tell me how it is being a slave to the US. Once your Oil is no more, so will be the relationship with daddy US.

Why is the American taxpayers $21 trillion in debt, US Corporations having stash $2.5 trillion in foreign banks and oil over $70 when should b $55?
8256 2018-07-05 10:50:38 You say we pore over your tweets looking for mistakes, well they're not hard to find
Define Monopoly for us, ". As of 2018, the 15 countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production"
So that would be 56% less than a monopoly?

8265 2018-07-05 10:48:52 rejoin the Iran deal - ease sanctions on Iran - the price of oil will fall
8266 2018-07-05 10:48:40 Have those tweets actually moved prices in a sustainable way? No. The forces pressing on oil markets and oil prices are far stronger than temperamental tweets.

8273 2018-07-05 10:47:34 Oman could use the revenue. How much (or little, rather) oil do they have left before they go back to fishing? A dozen years? Perhaps slightly more? Any money is better than no money, should they facilitate Saudi with maritime access to a DUDE pipeline.

8291 2018-07-05 10:44:12 The economy is already more diverse than it has ever been in our history.  The real problem - and it is *government's* problem, not the economy's - is that government is addicted to spending more than it takes in and it is especially hooked on oil money.

8341 2018-07-05 10:36:39 You just don't get it, do you! The #indyref took place during the 7thh centenary of #Bannockburn, when oil was over $100 pb & we'd just had a fantastic Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; but still only 38% found the @theSNP's plan worth voting for. #losers #whiners #CouldNotRunABath

8346 2018-07-05 10:36:07 You, when you directly compared it to the private sector oil industry. Or is there a subtle difference between private sector and privatised that I'm missing?
8347 2018-07-05 10:36:01 You're right, of course. I'm only doing it to lure them away from eating all the black oil sunflower seeds in the bird feeders!

8370 2018-07-05 10:31:49 This is why we should focus on US. Oil production . If we quit purchasing foreign oil for a while maybe they will get our message!!
8371 2018-07-05 10:31:48 So yes, there are too few charging stations in Europe. What are the car manufacturers doing about it? Oil companies? The industry is too corrupt to adapt, only wants to protect its stake. Clean air agenda has to be pushed by @transenv @Umwelthilfe @Green_Europe @Greenpeace..

8391 2018-07-05 10:29:24 It's just amazing how wrong Gartman was in his prediction that we'll never see oil above $44 a barrel again in his lifetime. It's more than $30 above that now.
8392 2018-07-05 10:29:15 Why can’t either of you actually comment on the topics. People get carried away so easily. “OPEC nations” are the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries which are 12 in total & they produce the oil used in the world. Trump’s demanding them to cut prices of crude oil ASAP.

8437 2018-07-05 10:19:54 'With Venezuela boasting the world’s largest proven oil reserves, China’s role in propping up the Maduro government provides an additional motivation, beyond the profit interests of the US energy conglomerates, for Washington to intervene.'

8497 2018-07-05 10:11:10 Iran was already complying with ALL inspections In exchange for a lift on sanctions like on oil. With trumps exit? The ban on Iran oil went back into affect hence a rise in gas prices that we now see. Cause and effect.

Our tax money will be going for the betterment of all in universal healthcare, affordable housing education, fixing our infrastructure instead of going to the gluttony of the wealthy and corporate welfare where oil companies and such are given our tax money as incentives
8539 2018-07-05 10:04:43 No such thing as “sustainable” palm oil guys. For palm oil to be produced rain forests will have cleared at some stage. Your product is made in the UK why not I just use vegetable oil and save on miles as well as palm oil?

you can do this! 
8542 2018-07-05 10:04:17 Yo dude, in most cases 10mm onward is “the point of no return” so anything smaller should close right back up
Mine were 36mm and I downsized to 20mm (left them out for a few weeks and moisturised the lobe with jojoba oil) then eventually got them as small as 16mm!
8543 2018-07-05 10:04:02 And domestic oil companies are making a fortune. Ask them to sell direct to USA and off global market.Would be less for us.
8544 2018-07-05 10:03:51 The skyrocketing oil prices & govt inability to rein them  is bigger threat than the combined opp put together.

8549 2018-07-05 10:03:22 "Oil prices fell on Thursday after US President Donald Trump sent a strident tweet demanding that OPEC cut prices for crude. Brent crude futures were at USD 77.70 per barrel at 0250 GMT, down 54 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last close."
8550 2018-07-05 10:03:14 #OIL: ‘It is Trump himself who is driving prices up through his Iran policy,’ Commerzbank says. ‘Trump wants all countries to reduce their oil imports from Iran to zero. This would strip up to 2.5 million barrels per day from the market.’ #WTI #BrentOil #OPEC

8555 2018-07-05 10:02:10 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones.

8628 2018-07-05 09:53:05 Lol. Rant more, I'm sure it'll make you feel better. I'm not even slightly against oil, if you pay any attention. I'm against the transmountain pipeline because it poses completely unacceptable risks to BC economy for not enough gain. Simple math.

Calm down and just wait for Q.
8629 2018-07-05 09:53:01 Haha I have oily combination skin, I take it you have dry? That’s probably why. If I use oil based I’m basically a Christmas tree

8645 2018-07-05 09:50:41 yeah I think they’re like soaked in oil and sugar 
8646 2018-07-05 09:50:19 India is getting squeezed by the Venezuela oil industry failing and US pressure to stop buying from Iran. China has no such problems. China just loaded Venezuela $5 billion to keep oil flowing to China and will keep doing business with Iran.

8677 2018-07-05 09:47:17 Cut the hypocrisy @realDonaldTrump! You are the one making oil prices go up!
8678 2018-07-05 09:47:16 Those aren't houses, they're investment opportunities for Russian and Saudi oil barons.
8679 2018-07-05 09:47:15 Venezuela nationalized oil companies. The oil cartels financing Trump want to get back to the country which took their crude. It’s the puppet masters plan. Nothing to do with human rights.

8719 2018-07-05 09:41:23 Opening up the North is a by product. The main reason is the exportation of our oil. In the coming budget what was the projected income of the oil so that we may know if the project makes financial sense. We might find it cheaper to leave the oil in the ground.

8746 2018-07-05 09:38:30 Oil is much cheaper in our neighbouring countries like Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland  the world market doesn't control that I guess.

The fact is rand is getting weaker under Ramaphosa that is why everything is getting expensive
8747 2018-07-05 09:38:26 The question is: how healthy do you want to be?
If you eat vegan, without junkfood (WFPB) (means also without oil), taking B12, use salt with iodine and eat ground flaxseeds most days, you are already much much healthier than most omnivores,
8748 2018-07-05 09:38:20 Lots of reasons for muted Polish CPI this year (Ukrainian workers, discount store price war, strong zloty etc.), But with 4 main drivers of Wages, Output Gap, Oil and Zloty all moving in tandem (with lag) I still think NBP may face decision sooner than market thinks.
8749 2018-07-05 09:38:07 Maybe someone should tell Trump BROWN people live in Venezuela, he'll lose interest. Of course Trump could be:
1. Looking for his 4th wife, we know he prefers foreign women.
2. Wants to steal all their oil. 
3. Planning his escape route through Venezuela, like Hitler.
8750 2018-07-05 09:38:02 Problem is the intl community is just looking at the oil not how the crucial revenues it generates are spent.

Libyan audit bureau documented gross corruption within GNA - intl community insisting Libyan wealth continue to be dumped in this black hole not responsible.

So, they voted for it, they should get it.

8762 2018-07-05 09:36:18 USA lead by Trump going to destabalise the Middle East to ensure pentagone vested intrests in the oil rich region.The so called and stupid move by Trump will lead to a great disaster and havoc in Middle East and South Asia as well.
8763 2018-07-05 09:36:08 We ran out of oil while cooking curry last night, my sister then told us to use Pam cooking spray & honestly...this the type of Fijian that I was talking about who be holding us  back
8764 2018-07-05 09:35:55 This is important. The edible oil business is full of shady operators.
8765 2018-07-05 09:35:43 Tea tree oil as a spot treatment or all over the face?
8766 2018-07-05 09:35:43 Not as good as castor oil tho
8767 2018-07-05 09:35:16 Venezuela nationalized oil companies. The oil cartels financing Trump want to get back to the country which took their drills. It’s a puppet masters show. Nothing to do with democracy.
8768 2018-07-05 09:35:14 No, that is not socialism. The State is not taking from the people. It is giving money to the people from oil revenues, an agreement that was made before the oil companies could drill there. If you think that's socialism, you need to study up some more.
8769 2018-07-05 09:34:58 Yes I agree, very useful in the right context as I've found using it with 1000s of patients, mainly in oral oil form low dose with lots of CBD:)

8797 2018-07-05 09:29:07 You, uh, aren't going to reduce oil prices by demanding something for nothing and you're certainly not going to get it by angrily tweeting at OPEC. Maybe give them a reason to work with you. You can start by not unilaterally abrogating multinational treaties.

8911 2018-07-05 09:07:12 This speaks to the source of the antagonist relationship between Iran & Saudi, both competing for limited market share available for production without depressing global oil prices & angering the oil companies who own controlling interest in pretty much all capitalist governments

9042 2018-07-05 08:42:57 4:42AM inverstment banks push the oil price up right now. from 73.65 to 74.15 it seems it goes up more
9043 2018-07-05 08:42:51 Happy birthday 

Allahs rahama now nd always
9044 2018-07-05 08:42:45 No we do not want that we want to increase our own oil production not  Saudi Arabia
9045 2018-07-05 08:42:42 As far as 'interesting' #HUR must be the most interesting for decades. Fractured basements are a whole new method of extraction that has never been done before. The eyes of the whole oil industry are watching and waiting.
9046 2018-07-05 08:42:09 That's just an absurd strawman argument. How often do you see oil falling from the sky? Do you realize how much effort is involved in extracting bitumen from the ground? It's not like scooping water off a lake.

I don't know anyone that thinks I'm a liberal, btw...
9047 2018-07-05 08:41:55 MashaAllah... bhai konsa oil use kartya ho?
9048 2018-07-05 08:41:42 Niiiiiice!

9071 2018-07-05 08:37:02 Mr Trump why until now we haven't heard the State says will refrain from buying Iranian oil
9072 2018-07-05 08:36:52 ..and just wrote off the £30m they paid for Bravo...

Yeah... I am sure we would all be happy if Klopp did that.

When it comes to money, you simply cant compare our club with city and their oil money.
9073 2018-07-05 08:36:29 Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves.For yrs,Gov used the income to subsidise local fuel prices ie.citizens got cheap fuel,also got used as political honey for votes.When your economy has crumbled THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING,stop complaining that Ven is paying less than us

9081 2018-07-05 08:35:26 He wanted the price per barrel of oil to rise above what it was.  I think it was hovering about $65 at that time.  He felt if Iran lowered its production the price per barrel would increase.
9082 2018-07-05 08:35:21 Thanks - so it's really about boosting the profits of the airlines by saving fuel.  Airlines could be in trouble by the end of the next decade due to the declining energy return on investment for getting oil out of the ground.

9086 2018-07-05 08:34:23 Once oil price reaches $100+ again, Mr Trump will blame OPEC, while others will blame his Iranian sanctions. Truth is that neither are to blame for industry underinvestment following the 2014 oil price collapse. Few conventional oil projects will come on stream in next few years.

9093 2018-07-05 08:32:49 Thanks Rhomboid for this spot. The peices are starting to come together. As it get closer to first oil it will get more interesting. Currently 13% of my portfolio.

9106 2018-07-05 08:30:00 Oga we export oil and sell in the international market for $50-$120 per barrel depends. Now you expect we that own the oil to buy at the same price that non-exporting countries sell theirs . Haba. Calm down for Jesus
9107 2018-07-05 08:29:36 #UBS on #DonaldTrump's impact on #oilprices : "The US president does not like higher oil prices. The authority of the US president over the oil market is such that oil prices rose marginally in European trading."
9108 2018-07-05 08:29:33 Support the natural transition to electric and green energies. Then oil prices won't be such a hassle anymore
9109 2018-07-05 08:29:09 Owen Patterson on @BBCr4today, lecturing the head of JLG on how to makes cars when you can just tell that he doesn’t even know which hole to pour oil into the engine of his BMW…
9110 2018-07-05 08:28:47 Always keep your baby clean ...give him a warm bath and wipe his body gently. Give him a sponge bath later in the day in summers and remember after oil massage make sure that you wipe off all the oil from the body or give him a bath.
9111 2018-07-05 08:28:37 The first move should have come from gov. There was no delay from crude oil to crude increases.

9113 2018-07-05 08:28:14 due to happen anyway. my main concern:Trump's pov towards real estate, selling off parts of the national forests for oil wells and gold mines. now to pollute other countries: Russia and N. Korea. remember Nixon opened China (one of the cleanest countries in the world) now dirty.

9119 2018-07-05 08:26:24 The Iranian government needs to save face and is expected to increase pressure on its regional opec neighbors in a response to Trump’s oil sanction threats.

9124 2018-07-05 08:25:11 Iran was already complying with ALL inspections In exchange for a lift on sanctions like on oil. With trumps exit  from deal - The ban on Iran oil went back into affect hence a rise in gas prices that we now see. Cause and effect.

9126 2018-07-05 08:24:19 In effetti “grafico del natgas” è un tantino generico. Sono mercati locali, è un po’ come dire “grafico delle obbligazioni governative”. E fino a poco fa, in assenza di mercati liquidi e liberalizzati, le esportazioni russe erano 100% indicizzate oil (BTZ, ATZ, Gasoil, greggi).
9127 2018-07-05 08:24:12 Let me just break the thing down for you. You expect the children of members of Assu to pay the same amount for school fees with non the children of members of Assu.Let’s be realistic.We are being scammed. We export oil and there is meant to be subsidized value for our citizens
9128 2018-07-05 08:23:45 Like I'd trust a snake oil salesman.
9129 2018-07-05 08:23:33 Some @MYANC minister sold our oil reserves for nothing a couple of years ago and @MYANC did nothing! No one went to jail!!! Now the same @MYANC is telling the ANC government  to build oil reserves to cushion the country from increasing oil prices.

9131 2018-07-05 08:23:15 I take omega 3 with cod liver oil and calcium tablets daily. A friend swears by turmeric. Just the result of an active life and occassional abuse of my body!

9133 2018-07-05 08:23:08 Congrats!

9171 2018-07-05 08:17:08 President Trump actually is responsible for the latest increases in global crude oil prices.

9317 2018-07-05 07:53:34 I see Trump says that OPEC is responsible for high oil prices but what I don't understand is we are now one of the largest oil producers in the world thanks to Pruitt and deregulation, theft of our national parks, so I say why don't "we" lower the prices since we produce more?.

OPEC agree on production output to force prices up/down. It is therefore uncompetitive to keep $barrel prices high. #CHANGE is required
9323 2018-07-05 07:52:49 I remember when Mbeki was in control and Bush was fighting the Asians for their oil, that never effected the countries economy or petrol prices this much. The Gupta and Nkandla saga also didn't, why is it now that black Donald Trump is in charge we suffer this much?.

9325 2018-07-05 07:52:47 There are two absolutely hilarious aspects to this tweet:  1.  There is nothing you can do to control OPEC and 2/. If the US had the oil (based on your historical business practices) you would be raping the rest of the world to put America First.

9385 2018-07-05 07:41:54 These are horrifically terrible suggestions, is this a joke? Halving GDP/real incomes will make people dramatically worse off. Tripling the price of oil will massively erode the real incomes of the poor and raise prices for all big time. Reducing our working week to 2 days...

9389 2018-07-05 07:40:55 You should ask if it was his interest. Your president have been so obsessed with oil even when fortunes in the sector is going down and people are beginning to see the prospect of moving away from fossilized fuels, he's still bent on it.

9435 2018-07-05 07:32:29 No. It's not infrastructure. It's the type of oil, how close it is to the surface/easy to extract and the cost of processing. 

You already extracted all your cheap oil in the 20th century.

9439 2018-07-05 07:31:04 Chris, I just don't think is true or that the evidence supports your view, which I admit has emotional resonance. I'm not pro-oil but as a birder (you must know this too) I've often been surprised that bird sanctuaries often have unlikely allies. Oil companies, military etc.

9443 2018-07-05 07:29:42 I don’t know. When you break a treaty with and reintroduce sanctions to one of the World’s larger oil producers (Iran) this kind of thing happens. It’s supply and demand. Economics 101. Of course, the principal qualification your economic advisors have is butt kissing...
9444 2018-07-05 07:29:33 There must be something spiritual about you brother!

Oil plenty for your head
9445 2018-07-05 07:29:17 Part of the Iran deal was the oil so we would not be held hostage by OPEC. Now Russia and China are enjoying the reduced price of Iran oil. Thanks Donald. Making Americans Poorer.

9467 2018-07-05 07:25:26 What utter nonsense.  Since the 1960s, Scotland has produced more oil and gas than Norway or Kuwait. England, in contrast, has run up a 2 trillion dollar debt, manufactures few (if any) finished goods and has zero global brands. We subsidize them. It's as simple as that.
9468 2018-07-05 07:25:20 Mr Prez ,  OPEC manipulated OIL price rise with  Saudi Arabia being the culprit  as they say SARMCO IPO needs to raise $ 100 BN next year from sale of 10% shares. That’s all they care about and will not lower prices unless bullied to. Investigate SARAMCO and block US investors.
9469 2018-07-05 07:25:12 Yes, I used to get it back in the day. Evening Primrose Oil on prescription - 6 x 1000mg tabs p/day - for 6 months sorted it out for me. After being told repeatedly it was “stress”, saw an enlightened GP. Worked brilliantly. Hope that helps x

9474 2018-07-05 07:24:28 The intention was to raise oil prices from the beginning.  bin Salman was displeased with the lower prices due to Iran's output.  Trump & bin Salman struck a deal way back last year.  Reportedly, Trump netted $1Bn in gold (lost the tweet so nada to show it).

9485 2018-07-05 07:21:05 If large pores are a concern, try an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) product. AHAs remove dead skin cells and hardened oil plugs, making pore appear smaller. Light chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and retinoids can also make pores look smaller.

9491 2018-07-05 07:20:25 Whale meat was free he told me- only the oil had value. So they used to load it onto the farm truck, several hundred weight, and cut it into chunks, then hang it up with baling wire in the Macrocarpa trees by the kennels. Kept for weeks and weeks.

9494 2018-07-05 07:19:36 Give extra virgin oil a go if you haven’t already. If that doesn’t work try natural protein like eggs/avacado, you’ll smell like breakfast but it’ll be worth it 
9495 2018-07-05 07:19:24 We need to take control of our own energy needs. Fifty years ago OPEC decided they needed to increase prices and since then we have been at their mercy. Same as Russia or China they can’t be trusted. We need American energy from conservation, the sun, wind, gas, oil and nuclear.

9556 2018-07-05 07:08:24 Soviet or Russian ships & oil rigs in the Arctic, based on ownership of Siberia. Bad for the environment.
9557 2018-07-05 07:08:07 Have you heard of olive pomance oil? It is the oil extracted from pomance, the residue of pulp after squeezing the fruit. Remaining oil is treated with chemical solvents and refined. This oil is used commonly in body care and soap production.
9558 2018-07-05 07:08:02 Correction, trying to fool us into forgetting they are in power and looted our oil reserves.
9559 2018-07-05 07:08:00 Wondering how to best store olive oil? You should keep it away from heat and light. Avoid storing it beside the stove or on the window sill. Store it in a cabinet and consume it within two months after opening the seal.

9568 2018-07-05 07:07:08 What about the HUGE oil reserves they looted!! That was meant to help us now, but they just saw the oil price WAS low then, & thought, aha, now is an opportunity for us to steal South Africans oil reserves! Now we sit with nothing like a baby in the winter with no blanket!

9575 2018-07-05 07:06:15 I was reading forums last night how taking 40-80mg of CBD oil per day helps with Polymyalgima, Crohns, colitis, joint pains, Insomnia, arthritis, fibromyalgia, anxiety etc & has literally changed peoples lives. How is this not going to be legalised in the UK? The NHS needs this!

9578 2018-07-05 07:05:47 Our system tries to not follow bad ideas with more bad ideas. Having social programs to benefit less fortunate is different than turning over total means of production and distribution to achieve social and economic equality of the masses.

9581 2018-07-05 07:05:31 That’s certainly my worry, and oil companies do have form for that ...
9582 2018-07-05 07:05:26 i agree, at this point, it's hard for me to define the limits of the act of "opening up" but then again, it's not for me alone to decide the limits. it's a decision that two partners take mutually, so let's see how it turns out the next time i'm in a romantic relationship.

Usually I don't want to eat after that.
9585 2018-07-05 07:05:01 i agree. i feel smarter when i get the emotional support i need to work on myself and be productive generally. having toxic, emotionally draining partners most definitely dumbed me down in the past.

I doubt it will be too long before the US invade Venezuela too. If only they didn’t have all that oil!
9596 2018-07-05 07:03:56 We all need to make sure that the US & the UK do not back stab us like in 1953 and 1979. These two Govts. have always given people up for the sake of oil and money. Reza Pahlavi is the one whom we all agree to support until referendum.

9601 2018-07-05 07:03:07 I've had numerous arguments on this k why can't the guy get something which is so evident regarding emotions but he'd miss out like you need to work so so hard just to make them talk

Besides, the damn Oil Cartels jack the price higher than that for winter EVERY year. Your priorities are messed up.
9603 2018-07-05 07:03:02 Everything from a line 300 miles north of Mexico City plus Baha Peninsula. Nothing below that line we want. USMC would have drug cartels gone in 2 weeks. Oil and gas plus resorts and a bit of farmland. Excellent candidate for 51st & 52nd states - way better than PR!

9635 2018-07-05 06:58:10 You’re the reason why gas prices are up. You pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal which means the reinstatement of sanctions. Iran’s inability to sell their oil means less oil supply which drives up prices. You want to reward the Saudis for giving to your personal business deals.

9680 2018-07-05 06:50:05 I really do think he'd just want to "take the oil".  But you just can't do that. Especially in Venezuela where much of it is heavy oil & oil sands that require hundreds of millions and many years to extract.
9681 2018-07-05 06:49:41 Not really. US trade is instrumental to the economies of every other 1st world country. We have oil, lumber, labor, minerals, manufacturing. We're self sufficient. If the entire planet conspired against the US in a trade war, we'd still win.

9685 2018-07-05 06:48:55 Oil is the main product, and the economy is a little bad right now, so a lot of workers have been laid off. We’re from Jordan, so we are more likely to be targeted, while the locals get all the jobs. Basically the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, until the poor go home.

9689 2018-07-05 06:48:27 Oil should be treated better. With respect. Don’t waste it out our tail pipes in ICE vehicles or on single use plastic. Put a real long term conservation plan in place & get most Canadians united back on board again.

9721 2018-07-05 06:43:27 The tax not tied to the oil price, so it's doesn't matter if oil is $10/bbl or $100/bbl - the tax is the same.

9728 2018-07-05 06:42:52 And Tesla batteries have the least cobalt of any li-ion battery in production. And cobalt is used in such small amounts that other cobalt sources haven’t been developed. Oil company propaganda. Big oil hates EVs, and will say and exploit anything to stop them.

9740 2018-07-05 06:40:50 Is it obvious to tell if a guy is wearing a penis pad for bigger bulge?  Nuts, olive oil, head cold, eels, drinking, and raw apples make a man hoarse.

9758 2018-07-05 06:39:04 So, maybe this is why I never learned how to be there for myself. How to manage my emotions. How to communicate in a healthy manner. I thought staying single will help me with all this, but I don't think that has happened.
9759 2018-07-05 06:38:52 I have been raised with all sorts of pampering but one thing which I never got was and remains, emotional support. I learned the value of emotional support only when I met and befriended supportive people. But then again, relationship with friends and with partners are different.
9760 2018-07-05 06:38:52 Alternatively we can laugh at his poor grasp of economics and cause and effect.

The USA had an improving relationship with a major oil producing nation and significant member of Opec...which Trump has fucked up. 

The USA then engaged in a trade war with the world.

9825 2018-07-05 06:30:08 Tried olive oil once.
Not sure I was thrilled with the results.
Was I doing it wrong?
9826 2018-07-05 06:29:24 Bury the bags , return to oil.
9827 2018-07-05 06:29:23 Kodwa baba Moyo, u are telling me u did not know that Mugabe rallies where attended through fear. Intimidation was the oil in Bob machine
9828 2018-07-05 06:29:22 And maybe you’re right; for me being single has not ever been an easy mental state; yet I hear feminists chastising me for it.

Nigeria is a major oil producer. Profit goes into particular accounts as « bakshish » for « lubrication »

9833 2018-07-05 06:27:56 Like we were conditioned to be on our own by parents because my father was deserted by his siblings and I used to be this person who was there for everyone but didn't need anyone until 3 years ago cuz when my father died, the strength to be on my own was too much and I fell flat
9834 2018-07-05 06:27:54 For their oil most likely.
9835 2018-07-05 06:27:14 @FlyFrontier I’m on a flight from Den to Providence. The cabin reeks like engine oil. We have been brought back to the gate. No one is telling us what is happening. The crew seems to be having an issue deciding IF this plane is safe. The smell is giving me a migraine.
9836 2018-07-05 06:27:08 I think the whole inner peace thing can tie in with a spiritual connection. It depends on how you're wired and what your understanding of spirituality is. In terms of partnerships, I imagine people can get satisfaction and support if they have realistic expectations.

9849 2018-07-05 06:25:57 Canada sells oil at a discount. Less than 1% of our oil is sold outside of Nirth America.
9850 2018-07-05 06:25:51 Coconut oil sis they slip right off
9851 2018-07-05 06:25:42 Lets call one half of the petrol cartel Pink Flower and the other half Standard Oil. In principle what will happen is that Pink Flower will totally cannibalize Standard’s Oil marketshare as the petrol cartel will open their patent vaults to aid the design of the new electric cars
9852 2018-07-05 06:25:40 There's a fantastic ramen joint near our house that uses this fried onion oil and it's to die for.  Visually looks totally simple and normal though.

9865 2018-07-05 06:23:42 i agree. the last two sort-of romantic relationships i have been in failed miserably cos of my attempts to suppress the need for emotional support. i told myself that i'll be strong and will manage all my emotions myself without burdening my partner, but oh well.. was a disaster.
9866 2018-07-05 06:23:27 what about a superior spiritual connection that we r raised to want? Can it just be that people need intimacy and help with kids that’s all?

9870 2018-07-05 06:22:44 Also the fluating oil production and prices from opec countries  (countries that produce oil) lyk US Saudis Arabia and Russia and also instability in the middle East where most oil comes from ....

9874 2018-07-05 06:22:09 Certainly I have been let down by friends and family as well. At the end of the day, we are all human, and so we can all be disappointing. I think the key, which I am working on as well, is to find peace in oneself.
9875 2018-07-05 06:22:05 Happy to be washing my hair this morning, I’ve been drowning in coconut oil all night
9876 2018-07-05 06:22:04 Serve with pinches of oil is hot water to combine.
9877 2018-07-05 06:22:02 USA "socialism" goverment money is used/ to bomb other nations for free!
(note, Saudis paid wth $10/oil barrel for Iraq1, DaddyBush. Profitable Capitalist war)

When USA also loots, like oil in Iraq2, Libya, it is Communism
All of USA originally Commie-Looted, just like Slavery
9878 2018-07-05 06:21:49 it would be interesting to see the trend over the last 15 years or so, mapping the US$ rate, oil price, pump price and taxes/levies as a visible comparison over time

9880 2018-07-05 06:21:36 My favourite memory as a kid was shooting bottle rickets into the oil refinery, hoping to see it explode. It never did. Now as an adult, I would have loved to see the palm tree catch fire.
9881 2018-07-05 06:21:34 And Russia loaned them money to be secured by US oil! Maggie, history is not going to be kind to you.
9882 2018-07-05 06:21:31 There's an essential oil for that.

9884 2018-07-05 06:21:20 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

In the presence of my enemies I'm looking straight ahead.

9892 2018-07-05 06:20:39 I think it's almost impossible to achieve it but people who might be able to show that they don't need anyone either do a brilliant facade or they've had terrible experiences owing to reliance and trust which leads to their attitude. Maybe.

9905 2018-07-05 06:18:23 Stop threatening Iran & allow it sell its Oil freely on World Markets. This will stabilize prices & cause them to fall. Both Iran & Venezuela can increase production but you Big Mafiosi Bully @realDonaldTrump want to wipe out both. Why? to Steal their Oil as you steal Syrian Oil!
9906 2018-07-05 06:18:21 At Dore a bloke in a white t-shirt expertly pushes through the crowd to get on the train first; the look of triumph in his eyes is a tiny oil lamp in a hovel on an otherwise uninhabited island.
9907 2018-07-05 06:17:59 I often think people project all sorts of desires and expectations onto their partners, which can be an unfair burden on them and highly disappointing when they realise that they will never find inner peace by relying so much on another human.
9908 2018-07-05 06:17:56 Lets scrap the 250 mill, bigger grant coming from China. C hina’s government will give Venezuela a special loan for $5b to increase oil production, state news agency AVN reported, citing economy and finance minister Simon Zerpa. Wont be surprised if PetroChina workers come too

9910 2018-07-05 06:17:50 As a trader I would buy anything that gives me cheaper oil. You can hedge yourself using the contract or there will be third parties e.g banks thatyou can do the hedging through. Anything that allows you to buy the crude cheaper and improve your refinery margins.

9921 2018-07-05 06:16:31 clearly @MikeHudema prefers the oil that is going to be extracted and refined any way (due to lack of alternative infrastructure) be shipped by the more dangerous rail ! If he really wanted to make a change he would be an activist for developing solar into our society.

9948 2018-07-05 06:13:13 The reason why this argument is going on is because you don't know history. Since the beginning of Nigeria. Igbos have been the one feeding Nigeria. Both our oil, our trade and our international trade.... What else is Nigeria good at???
9949 2018-07-05 06:13:01 My guess from Canada which sells you oil at a discount is that your present pump price could last all July and early August.

9958 2018-07-05 06:12:05 Oil Currency Monopoly by USA has to change to Multi - Currency. Only trading oil in $ hurts everyone else.
9959 2018-07-05 06:12:01 Oil? Business interests? Because Putin said so?
9960 2018-07-05 06:11:53 dont think that's possible. one constantly needs support. also, the relationship dynamics must ensure that support is mutual and one partner isnt too burdened. good parenting leads to one's expectation of constant support. bad parenting leads to one's desire to be supported.

9967 2018-07-05 06:11:15 yes to electricity. Long haul transport and pet chem together account for 70 perfect petroleum and that’s the crux

9969 2018-07-05 06:11:04 for all those people who love carbon and burning fossil fuels this is only the beginning and sadly out here in AB we have had 4 slow years and still we wait for the oil patch to come back instead of renewable energy SAD!
9970 2018-07-05 06:10:55 The 9 year old president grappling  with the economics of the oil industry. “I want lower prices now!!”  Astonishing.
9971 2018-07-05 06:10:54 Which Economy does the Igbos control??? The real people controlling the Nigeria Economy are the Hausa and the Yoruba's, or how many Oil well is owned by Igbos, because of you petty trading and going to China to import in substandard product you think you control the economy. 
9972 2018-07-05 06:10:53 Its all about oil.
9973 2018-07-05 06:10:45 I think it’s brain chemistries, supportive nurture you may have had that enables you,wires your mind. Because I don’t see support in society

9979 2018-07-05 06:09:47 reservations built and forgotten, water poisoned by lead, water poisoned by oil spills, water poisoned by hubris, what for?—“What so proudly we hailed”—Proud—no I am not proud. I am heartbroken. Embarrassed and at times at a loss of what to do. On this July 4th, May we reflect
9980 2018-07-05 06:09:47 Ok stable genius, how many pilot licenses are you giving hijacker bin taint for a barrel of oil nowadays?

9983 2018-07-05 06:09:25 I can’t believe green peace.  Do they see how much foreign oil comes into Canada.  Get a job oh wait there are none #thanksliberals
9984 2018-07-05 06:09:22 Its medicinal properties have been known for ages. It’s a question of perception. Cannabis oil is not the same as smoking spliffs! High time it was available for a wide range of conditions. How’s Astrid?
9985 2018-07-05 06:09:05 So corn oil is made from corn right??
So vegetable oil is made from vegetables.
So what’s baby oil made out of 
9986 2018-07-05 06:08:52 Sana oil.
9987 2018-07-05 06:08:36 When I see little Trumps demand And also many retweet’s I must laugh. I here clearly Mama calling. Did you ever think about the tax you have on oil? Did you ever think about who is trying to manipulate the oil price by their own oil pumps? Even if to expensive you do it
9988 2018-07-05 06:08:27 According to Index of Eight Core Industries released by Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the growth of eight core infrastructure industries has dropped to 10-month low of 3.6% in May 2018 due to decline in production of crude oil and natural gas.
9989 2018-07-05 06:08:16 If they keep up this "abolish ICE" rubbish, it will drive more people to vote R.  Democrat leadership understands that, but the base is still gung ho.
9990 2018-07-05 06:08:02 Protecting America are you Donny @realDonaldTrump ? In the Syrian Dessert? where you ordered US Military to guard Syria's Oil & Gas Reserves & to shoot to kill maim & injure Syrian Soldiers wishing to recover Syrian Territory & Syrian Resources for the Syrian People. US Thieves!!
9991 2018-07-05 06:08:00 Your higher prices are not due to Canada as we sell oil at a discount. And if you drive to Canada for a holiday you will find at our pumps you will pay more than at home.
9992 2018-07-05 06:07:43 Oil prices in 1998 was about $20/pb yet no one was dying due to malnutrition. Saying that the country’s economy is bad because of the fall in oil prices is not understanding Venezuela’s reality.
9993 2018-07-05 06:07:35 CHELSEA you think they are ashamed the truth is the people who didn't vote for our great @Potus didn't have the fortitude to walk out of the oil painting they call life our @Potus is a doer,loyal to our country you want to apologize,try apologizing for being such a harsh female

9996 2018-07-05 06:07:10 I don't have a supportive partner, but I have a lot of support. I often wonder how people stay focused, productive and useful with a partner!
9997 2018-07-05 06:06:55 Reading conspiracy websites written by white supremacists who pushed pizzagate isn’t “doing your research.” We live in an era where the President is taking part in a real conspiracy to make billions for himself off of Russian oil/gas.
9998 2018-07-05 06:06:49 “Oil central”
9999 2018-07-05 06:06:48 Seriously,where is this inner drive born, how is it nurtured?By parenting or good genes? That one marches like a soldier, single and strong?

10007 2018-07-05 06:06:01 become greener hopefully within the next 10 to 20 years.  Just thinking back, I don't remember seeing any of you clambering aboard the oil rigs in the north sea over all those years of production, so your protests at UKOG seem a little futile IMO, but it is just that, my opinion!
