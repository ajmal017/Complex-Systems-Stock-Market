Maybe someone should report on this story?

36 2018-04-10 23:57:25 Remember the huge oil dividend we were all supposed to get in terms of growth when oil fell? I think if it goes back up will be a drag on the economy but not as much as we think like how we over estimated the impact on consumers with lower oil

38 2018-04-10 23:57:19 Yep that's what I did. Those affected will be compensated and the field and groundwater will have to be decontaminated.  I could raise my hands in the air and yell "Why!?" in futility and outrage, but I remember that there was oil on the ground 200 years ago and we survived then.
39 2018-04-10 23:57:18 Naw fam blow off steam on the weekends kill the classes during the week. Well "oiled" machine. And by oil I mean alcohol

#sinclairBroadcastGroup you are wasting your time and $ on Television. NextGenTV um...do you drink oil too? #Humanity is evolving. #LadyLogic #Tyler
41 2018-04-10 23:57:12 Vaping can be expensive depending on the delivery method (flower, oil, wax) but often microdosing can work which really helps with the cost. Sublingual sprays and Phoenix tears I find to be more effective than capsules.
42 2018-04-10 23:57:09 The changes were made within the last year or so. I had about 8 boxes of the old ones. But you know as well as anyone who has used the old ones somethings different, they are no longer soft, or cool, the smell is from processing or whatever you do to make them. Oil or gas smell.
43 2018-04-10 23:57:08 Sadly Putin cannot give up the strategic position in Syria.  It is both access to a direct Mediterranean port for his military & a stop gap from a pipeline between Europe and Qatar, which would undercut the Russia's gas/oil sales to Europe.

Syria is more about Russia than Syria.

50 2018-04-10 23:56:34 Greed, lies and coverups are ruling us right now. We all want change.  We all want better for our families. 

Is better watching companies dump pollutants into our streams and rivers?
Is better taking our parks away to drill for more oil, and raise taxes on solar energy?

53 2018-04-10 23:56:28 It means at least 3 things:
1) Acknowledging that we'll need oil forever: things we need/want require these fuels.
2) Understanding that where it makes economic sense, begin substituting fossil fuels for clean renewables.
3) Understanding that we can't quit oil `cold turkey'.
54 2018-04-10 23:56:25 Oil is no longer ecologically responsible. Start backing solar, wind and alternative energy sources. Listen to what real Canadians want for the future.

57 2018-04-10 23:56:07 This was sarcastic. Oil is CLEARLY not the future. Burning oil is like eating sugar, sure it’s great in the short term but if you keep eating it your body will break down waaaay faster than if you didn’t eat it. Comparison being body=environment habitable to humans.
58 2018-04-10 23:56:06 Do you mean to protect the oil price?
59 2018-04-10 23:55:57 This is not an interprovincial fight over KM pipeline. It’s way bigger than that. It’s a fight between Big Oil and the people of BC over who’s responsible for decisions impacting our land and water. #KinderMorgan #bcpoli #pipeline

67 2018-04-10 23:54:54 Under that hypothetical scenario, how long do you envision it taking for oil to go down to $3? Decades?
68 2018-04-10 23:54:44 I hate oil changes because I spend $70 each time

72 2018-04-10 23:54:22 Is there a comparison to be made between the oil companies of the 1970s and today's tech giants? Both provide something consumers use every day, both represent corporate interests on a massive scale, and both seem more concerned with global than domestic affairs. Discuss.
73 2018-04-10 23:54:07 same price roughly as us in Australia. bloody oil companies ripping us off and Gov't doesn't do anything because they tax it at the bowser
74 2018-04-10 23:54:02 There was no oil for balloon
75 2018-04-10 23:54:00 Burning the midnight oil.  The day has not been long enough.
76 2018-04-10 23:53:58 Yes, for USA the petrodollar is more important than oil as it allows the USD to be a global reserve currency.
77 2018-04-10 23:53:50 I don't think you get it.... If a pipeline isn't built they will just train it out... oil is still pulled from the ground. We are protecting ourselfs from being at the mercy of the USA if they go crazy with protectionism.
78 2018-04-10 23:53:39 how much do you think a Nissan Leaf cost? same as a brand new car plus you get government rebate. 
the problem only is the long wait to get one. 
how much will you spend at the pump each month? $0
how much oil change needed when you drive an EV? $0
79 2018-04-10 23:53:34 These bad boys were hot.  Made a sauce using an impulse buy of a sketchy can of oil packed red chilis at the Asian market.
80 2018-04-10 23:53:32 No that would be real estate and manufacturing. Both of which, on their own, drive the economy more than oil and gas combined.

85 2018-04-10 23:52:52 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
86 2018-04-10 23:52:52 The taxpayer. And the ruling class, bankers, oil companies, and other corporations are the ones that make great profits with wars. And the do it by sending working class kids to kill and die fighting for the same energy corporations that refuse to pay a penny in the US.

106 2018-04-10 23:50:36 for the last 3 days I’ve been adding lemon oil to my water and now regular water tastes bland and unappealing. I will now ONLY be drinking water with lemon oil for the rest of my existence. anything less is insulting.

109 2018-04-10 23:50:26 They know what to do. Keep in mind they are dealing with a private company from Houston Texas, who wants to invest money on oil in Canada. Harper and @lraitt won't tell us much. All was hidden re: Oil Tycoon meetings with #CPC privately. Nine years, no results. #ChickenParty

124 2018-04-10 23:48:33 ‘Smart’ are those who think a carbon tax on Ontarians will fix the planet, yet say nothing about the oil pouring out of the Middle East. Sure, whatever toots your horn.  Oh the economy will fix itself as we’ve seen in the past 15 years of this stupidity.
125 2018-04-10 23:48:31 Just got an oil change in Feb , I need one again 
126 2018-04-10 23:48:16 What I am actually concerned about is that the left - as usual - and with the backing of GOOGLE is distorting history to pour oil on our racial fires, which is bad for everyone, especially blacks. Lynching is bad (this is for the terminally stupid) but...
127 2018-04-10 23:48:12 Did something new while writing tonight - put some tea tree oil into a diffuser, and I swear this is the clearest my stuffy nose has been all day.  #amwriting #essentialoils

131 2018-04-10 23:47:51 You are the only honest trader.  Others I follow work for vested interests to promote oil with bullish narrative.  OPEC thus far has managed to move glut to China from the US.

143 2018-04-10 23:46:17 It was inevitable once China and Russia stopped using the US dollar to buy/sell oil with each other.
144 2018-04-10 23:46:08 @aocs job to ensure safety standards are met and oil properly tested in US but they are dominated by seed oil chemists and do not want anyone looking too closely at inflammatory,refined GE oils with high BHA ....
145 2018-04-10 23:46:07 Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just happen to be lawyers for Cambridge Analytica, and are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company?
146 2018-04-10 23:46:00 U don’t have to do this, coconut oil it up for 3 days
147 2018-04-10 23:45:55 How in the hell does she expect this state to make money when you give big Oil and corporations tax cuts the lottery money NOT going where it should either I can’t wait to get rid of that evil woman @MaryFallin
148 2018-04-10 23:45:45 Should’ve got my oil changed  but naw I had to fall asleep
149 2018-04-10 23:45:44 Heading says 'BRITAIN' - as usual it gets Scotland's oil
150 2018-04-10 23:45:37 26:41 These are they that shall condemn him when it shall be, as with marrow and fatness; and my flax, mine oil and the Arabians, and the Perizzites, and the face of a solemn sound.
151 2018-04-10 23:45:36 I hate when I put too much olive oil on my veggies
152 2018-04-10 23:45:32 One of the reasons Europe is rich is because EU countries colonized, abused other countries. They stole their wealth and they still do at certain extent. UK did that with India. USA killed half a million of Iraqi children because of oil. Open your eyes!
153 2018-04-10 23:45:20 We're speaking about @rickmercer, oatmeal, #humboldtsrong and oil prices with @GeorgeMurphyOil
154 2018-04-10 23:45:20 Most of It and oil is in Khuzestan and it gets pumped out by the regime and most of the money gose to Tehran or the IRGC. Very little gets spent on Khuzestan granted the Shah did the same thing but still.
155 2018-04-10 23:45:20 See?  We agree!  All that matters is winning.  If they show heart, they’ll win more.  Simple!!!
156 2018-04-10 23:45:10 I wonder if that’s a nod to the band Midnight Oil & some song lyrics. “Armistice Day”??? Another song? Just a thought...
157 2018-04-10 23:44:58 (しょんぼり)
158 2018-04-10 23:44:39 もう９時なんじゃけど……
159 2018-04-10 23:44:37 Nope.  The tide that high oil brings lifts all of the business world.
160 2018-04-10 23:44:31 He is an extremely successful builder, a self-made billionaire, father of five successful children, a man who owns luxury properties around the world, and is now the strongest leader in the world who is bringing back jobs - steel plants, coal mines, cars, oil & gas, so much more.
161 2018-04-10 23:44:26 Yes!  Block pipelines so oil has to go by other means... how did that work out for Lac-Mégantic Quebec?  Ships, trains and trucks do more harm to the environment than any pipeline has.
162 2018-04-10 23:44:24 Don't forget to always use massage oil before, during, and after sex!
163 2018-04-10 23:44:07 stαrt with smoothies , just mix veggies & fruits & αdd wαter & coconut oil .
164 2018-04-10 23:43:58 Oil. I hate conspiracy theories but oil seems to be a recurring theme.
165 2018-04-10 23:43:50 If America finds about all the oil on your forehead they may just invade your face.
166 2018-04-10 23:43:46 I hope not. Oil is fine where it is imo. Now only if WCS can catch up.
167 2018-04-10 23:43:45 You don't darken my life. You're a light to so many lives. Sometimes you just need to refill the oil and trim wick of the lamp to have it burning bright again. We all love you.
168 2018-04-10 23:43:40 Roasting them in the oven would help when drizzled with cooking oil. Not sure how you feel about onions, but they are usually my starting point for a stir fry. I sauté them to where they're soft and clear and then toss in any other veggies I use.

170 2018-04-10 23:43:24 its the cocoa butter and rosewood oil! it used to smell like chocolate but it was kind of overwhelming so they altered the formulation
171 2018-04-10 23:43:01 Enough is enough petrol company and price fixing, why last time oil was $100 a barrel we paid 1.25 at the pump now its $63 and we paying 1.30, there is something wrong with this picture.

174 2018-04-10 23:42:34 #ThoughtExperiment: Could @realDonaldTrump be sold on a big tariff on non-NAFTA oil imports (unless re-exported)? Helps NAm. prod. in an Trumpy way while creating a de facto #carbonprice; limits supply and raises marginal cost. The free trader in me hates it, but #desperatetimes?
175 2018-04-10 23:42:31 A well capitalised company actually producing oil. A great combination.
176 2018-04-10 23:42:21 P.L.B wemersonbr da empresa PANTANEIRA LOGÍSTICA BRASIL, dirigindo volvo FH, saiu  da empresa NS Oil em Oslo, transportando Diesel 25t, para entregar na empresa  em Birmingham. A distância estimada de 2251 Km   #etsfs
177 2018-04-10 23:42:18 Any unrefined, low temp pressed oil including rape seed is one product that should definitely be organic and pesticide residue tested.Surprised @aocs never looks at this issue especially knowing it is common to use dimethoate/malathion/chlorpyrifos in US if not torula trapping.
178 2018-04-10 23:42:12 What caught my attention about Russia was a report on Vice's HBO show about 5 years ago regarding claims to the Arctic now that the ice is melting and access to oil reserves in increasing.
179 2018-04-10 23:42:08 this oil warmer has my whole house smelling soooo good
180 2018-04-10 23:42:04 Sardines on crusty bread or baguette, mustard or olive oil, onion, pepper, stop me anytime.
181 2018-04-10 23:42:04 I'm just going to use quotation marks here, with gratitude shown to @Twylo. "So Trump'spersonal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? WOW."
182 2018-04-10 23:42:03 Talking to Jean about food tonight. I'm cooking a late supper of peppers, Prawns, Indian spices, Onion Bajhis, 2 small donner balls, green veg with olive oil and when cooked, 4 scrambled eggs on top. Spices are Tumeric, Cumin, Coriander and Fennugreek.
183 2018-04-10 23:41:53 Wish i had my oil pen 
184 2018-04-10 23:41:51 Establishment have many hating the poor, the working class, the homeless, independence motivated Scots, the Irish, the Russians, the mentally ill. It’s all calculated, engineered. Peace does not line their pockets. Missiles do, oil does, fracking does.
185 2018-04-10 23:41:47 These testimonies about the Oil of Shachah are blessing me so much. Wow! Soon I will have larger bottles of oil available for those who desire a large amount of this oil. 

I know GOD is moving in it. Bless GOD.
186 2018-04-10 23:41:39 His bill was a LOT more limited (basically, oil for seizures and right to try for terminally ill patients IIRC), which is good in some ways but bad in others
187 2018-04-10 23:41:21 We  hemp seed oil! Makes a perfect carrier oil for our tinctures.

189 2018-04-10 23:40:46 Yes, for machine oil.
190 2018-04-10 23:40:44 Have you notice oil being probed  up artificially by slowing production the demand not there Taxies run on Chippie fat there's bio degradable Gas Electric the days of oil company buying alternatives is dead dying planet means oils a dirty pollutant
191 2018-04-10 23:40:34 How one little Tweet will take down, Billionaire, Tom Steyer.  He has ties to RUSSIAN, Gennady Timchenko, a Putin associate. Investing in RUSSIAN oil company. He thinks he’s going to impeach Trump. You got another thing coming!

197 2018-04-10 23:40:18 Try CBD oil. Not cannabis. This is legal bc THC is removed. It worked for a friend of mine who has migraines. She bought it from another friend of ours. It’s called Ultra Cell. Supposed to have the best bioavailability and uses the whole plant. I’m sure you can order it offline.
198 2018-04-10 23:40:16 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
199 2018-04-10 23:40:12 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
200 2018-04-10 23:40:08 You better hope oil does not hit triple digits, you will see a recession faster than your head will spin
201 2018-04-10 23:40:08 recent google search: essential oil blend for when ur done bingeing and now hate yourself
202 2018-04-10 23:40:07 It’s easy to “cut #PalmOil as a PR move. But time and again, studies have shown that other vegetable oils are more resource intensive. And the uptake of palm oil certified by RSPO  (or other progs that actually ban deforestation) is slow because buyers won’t pony up the cash.

204 2018-04-10 23:40:04 So when an establishment post no smoking why is vaping okay? Lots more oil filled dangerous smoke.
205 2018-04-10 23:39:54 Disappointing leadership in listening to the BC community to find common ground and a solution that benefits Canada while also protecting our environment - not catering to a Texas oil titan.
206 2018-04-10 23:39:53 Alive & Well  is one more store selling Maui Bronze Moisturizing Tanning Oil!
207 2018-04-10 23:39:47 Nope. There's more. It's the spoils of war they love. The oil usually, but the power trip probably has a lot to do with it. Narcissists love power.
208 2018-04-10 23:39:36 We just got some new *Galadria 1G Hood Oil - Dab Society*
209 2018-04-10 23:39:28 If we don't supply the oil, someone else, probably less ethical, will. Attempting to restrict supply of an in-demand product benefits only the unscrupulous. Remember prohibition?
210 2018-04-10 23:39:22 I’ve been to Ahvaz things are not great there but steal the oil ?
211 2018-04-10 23:39:19 Why aren't we weaning off fossil fuels and promoting/developing/training workers in skills for renewable resources, something that can be a benefit for every province, not just one? (And why didn't Alberta save some $ from the good oil years to afford the bust cycle?)2/2
212 2018-04-10 23:39:18 Ah a fit young man like yourself
And keeping healthy
As long as your not making it compulsory for the rest of us no worries
Thank god for the frackers that we were spared peak oil eh
213 2018-04-10 23:39:09 CBD OIL. It’s legal in 49 states. English organic is best.
214 2018-04-10 23:39:06 Soon I'll be able to see if CBD oil actually works for me :^)

226 2018-04-10 23:37:46 Dear @JustinTrudeau, 

The Oil Barons have corporate media wondering aloud about how you can force a pipeline on a province that said no thanks. 

Don't fall for it. Kick the can. Don't bother forcing it. Call it the next PM's issue. You went as far as the people asked. #cdnpoli
227 2018-04-10 23:37:41 Bruh i went from crusty al qaeda most wanted to oil tycoon prince of saudi arabia lol
228 2018-04-10 23:37:38 It may be safer to use refined fraudulent olive oil than an unrefined oil grown with organophosphates for olive fruit fly and manganese/copper based fungicide with lipophilic adjuvant. It's how you grow the issue here if TFA and FFA in EVOO too high something rancid going on.
229 2018-04-10 23:37:27 If you want to go live without oil, be my guest. You’ll pretty much have to move into the woods, live off the land and walk everywhere. Oh yeah, even using twitter makes you a hypocrite if you truly knew what oil is used to produce
230 2018-04-10 23:37:14 Good on gas lol 20 dollar oil changes too lol
231 2018-04-10 23:36:56 Exactly.  I have a business I'm trying to run selling Scentsy and CBD oil. Can't leave for too long
232 2018-04-10 23:36:19 How the hell can anyone be Pro Corbyn Pro EU. It's like trying to mix oil and water.
233 2018-04-10 23:36:18 Peppermint oil better get rid of ants. That’s all I’m saying.
234 2018-04-10 23:36:15 It’s a world revolution we need! establishment, thru the media, pitting Christian v Muslim, West v east, brits v brits, everyone against refugees, all media fabrication. Only two sides here, us v the 1% that are taking us to war for oil, with our tax money and to kill our kids.
235 2018-04-10 23:36:10 It's not just oil that's needlessly traveling by rail.
236 2018-04-10 23:36:07 Absolutely Disgusted with Trump taught he was different ,looks like hes going the same way as the barbarian Obama. Shame. 
A global campaign against Russia based on a whim and a false flag. All about the oil.
237 2018-04-10 23:35:51 Pruitt has a special boat that runs on the blood and tears of baby harp seals which have been force fed oil. He uses it to ram manatees while he sings his joy at remorseless plunder, the only thing that makes him feel alive. #EPA

245 2018-04-10 23:35:04 “Our” meaning Canadian oil from Canada. And yes, I have shared in various energy companies so technically, yes, I own part of a few oil companies.
246 2018-04-10 23:35:01 Same. But unlike many of my friends, my profile is almost empty and my privacy settings are locked down tight. I also clean out my ad preferences twice a month. And absolutely no app permissions. I hide ads and I report the scammy snake oil ads.
247 2018-04-10 23:34:44 Well if the oil industry says so. Then I believe you. 
248 2018-04-10 23:34:42 Yes because allowing your season ticket base to determine roster decisions is the way to go. While much of this fan base has always prefered their lunch pale guys to high-end talent, at the end of the day, all that matters is winning...just like everywhere else.
249 2018-04-10 23:34:37 Small club... plastic PL trophy bought with oil money. Doesn’t quite deserve to be a CL winner.

257 2018-04-10 23:33:51 Most bear markets in equities have appeared after energy price spikes so we better not see oil anywhere near triple digits
258 2018-04-10 23:33:47 They haven't done anything. And most likely will not do anything.. Trudeau just screwed over everyone with the oil industry in the west just now. where the majorit of us in Newfoundland work; myself included because the economy here in Newfoundland is in complete ruins :/
259 2018-04-10 23:33:39 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
260 2018-04-10 23:33:31 Embracing the world would mean putting the oil sands to bed and replacing it with renewables. Take a look at what the world is ACTUALLY doing in regards to fossil fuels; tech of the past....... kind of like you.
261 2018-04-10 23:33:25 Is this why the oil industry is so well self regulated? Or the tobacco industry? Or the pharma industry? Or the ISPs with net neutrality? Quit pretending self regulation works. It never has and never will.
262 2018-04-10 23:33:09 Let's trade. You can come to a country with true conservatives and a reactionary fundamentalist church. And I can return to Socialist Norway, oil or not. I arrived when oil was less than $50, so not a problem for me. Your socialist country pays me lager pension than US paradise.
263 2018-04-10 23:32:54 Cruz didn't whoop nothing but his own reputation. He looked like a sleazy right wing snake oil salesman trying to con us into believing his lies. The only people that he fools are the gullible poor.  His rich donors and cronies voted for him for the promise of tax cuts.

The world has tons of oil right now and the real reason prices are going up are not being shared. This story is super fake news! Get to the real greedy reasons for it!?
270 2018-04-10 23:32:16 This fuking bitch is going to talk about national security after murdering 500,000 Iraqi children for her globalist buddies so they could control the mideast oil distribution routes??

282 2018-04-10 23:30:02 tumeric + honey masks, tea tree oil, bio oil, vitamin E oil or take vitamin E supplements

284 2018-04-10 23:30:01 YEAH. They assume “”all natural”” is better than “”that conspiracy to keep us medicated”” or whatever... when usually the former is unregulated snake oil lmao
285 2018-04-10 23:29:59 Have you ever been to Oslo? It doesn’t have the land mass of Red Deer. Oslo 57 sq km Red Deer 67 sq km. So, I think your point is look at this oil country going green. 20% of the population, a fraction of the land area. I’d say we’re doing pretty good too.
286 2018-04-10 23:29:56 I need edibles or CBD oil 
287 2018-04-10 23:29:55 Good question.  Asked lots, never unanswered.

I still liked Petro-Canada.  We needed it to keep our (you & me) go her on the pulse of the industry.

Currently we get the shaft from the CEO of big oil.
American CEO's at that.

They aren't crazy, we are.
288 2018-04-10 23:29:51 Germany's "Invasion" was deliberate. That country is part of the "coalition" carpet bombing the middle east. The pact with other countries in the "coalition" is to take on refugees caused by their bombing. Its a trade off....oil and resource availability for refugees.

290 2018-04-10 23:29:43 @james_trades If increasing oil prices affect guidance for the airline stocks. Hopefully they hedged against increasing oil prices.
291 2018-04-10 23:29:38 Still doesn't justify adding 14 new oil storage tanks on top of 12 on Burnaby Mountain, in between 10000 residents, and up to 30000 students, staff, and volunteers at SFU
292 2018-04-10 23:29:29 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
293 2018-04-10 23:29:27 I grew up in Fort McMurray. The oil sands helped put me through school, food on our table and clothes on our back. For god sake, do something.
294 2018-04-10 23:29:14 BUT WE HAVE OIL MONEY!1!1!1
295 2018-04-10 23:29:14 今日新歓なんだよなあ 楽でいいけど
296 2018-04-10 23:29:08 Oh no you typed oil. Lock your doors....
297 2018-04-10 23:29:04 I got called boojie for using peanut oil I
298 2018-04-10 23:28:55 Why does the UN, USA, and others, never seem to interfere when Black African dictators go on the rampage? Just those in the ME who have plenty of oil/gas resources?
299 2018-04-10 23:28:42 Spice tolerance has certainly increased. I've dumped half this container of chili oil into my soup noodle, and I'm not even breaking a sweat!
300 2018-04-10 23:28:34 That study merely asking what a persons wages were, and didnt compare within fields. As most men here are employed or in the oil industry they report a very large wage - as compared to unemployed females reporters and the majority of women not employed in hard labor oil work.
301 2018-04-10 23:28:30 Then do that one. Tell me again about your oil spill worries after.

ht tps://youtu.be/-7DTXKUf200
302 2018-04-10 23:27:57 Haha I feel ya. I went to a farmers market a couple weeks ago and this old Italian man who was selling garlic, olive oil, and cheese (and had TONS of stories), offered me a job at his restaurant. 
303 2018-04-10 23:27:56 a similar example happened is the 1953 Iranian coup d'état that was brewed by USA and UK to stop the nationalisation of Iranian oil ressources. It's almost the same in Syria, with the difference that it is a gas pipeline war.
304 2018-04-10 23:27:51 Anybody got any cannabis oil
305 2018-04-10 23:27:49 Yes that must be why they steal oil from Khuzestan leaving the population destitute and broadcast tv shows that say Ahvaz is an Aryan/Persian city and they have been protesting non-stop for about a week.
306 2018-04-10 23:27:44 Then why the hell do you drive a car, use a plane or heat your home. Enough of the bullshit as the oil is coming from overseas. Stand up for your country enough is enough!

309 2018-04-10 23:27:29 Today in class I got a bad migraine and instead of running to my car right away to go home(while I could still drive) I stayed in class and put sunglasses on and took all of my meds and put peppermint oil on, and I just wish that pain wasn’t real. And that teachers understood.
310 2018-04-10 23:27:16 i luv whoever started the oil meme
311 2018-04-10 23:27:11 Yep, we're going to build our jobs on oil, and when that's all gone and we've dumped all that carbon into the atmosphere, why we'll just create more jobs! Out of ummm, sand.
312 2018-04-10 23:27:10 Hello oil change, new cabin filter, and wiper blades... goodbye eating.. #melodramatic

314 2018-04-10 23:27:06 It’s not just about oil - the US are protecting the petrodollar.
315 2018-04-10 23:26:54 People got way bullish on oil in a hurry
316 2018-04-10 23:26:52 AVwwwwwwwwwwww
317 2018-04-10 23:26:36 Dow up 428Gold up 4Oil up to 65.60Even aud up to 128.6
318 2018-04-10 23:26:29 Eastern canada doesn't want a pipeline for Alberta oil. It would rather import from the US or middle east. Foolishness from a part of the country that keeps voting for liberals.
319 2018-04-10 23:26:10 Snake if you are intolerant than the Devil passes rose oil for gas
320 2018-04-10 23:26:06 I’m going to drive my oil leaking car  up and down these streets LOL

323 2018-04-10 23:25:32 え、まって見に行きたい…
324 2018-04-10 23:25:28 Nope I did not.Libya are where they are because of consequences of Gaddafi’s tribes and clans..He was a dictator and very much corrupt.Corrupt leaders breed corrrupt citizens.Oil reserves are mostly being bought by private companies in Europe or controlled by armed corrupt forces
325 2018-04-10 23:25:23 Oil thought?
326 2018-04-10 23:25:20 Fam that much for an oil change the car would hav two just catch fire lol

328 2018-04-10 23:25:14 This is gonna sound like peak white girl Pinterest crap but I swear after years of trying expensive creams it looks like the best solution for under-eye circles and lines for me has been 8 glasses of water a day and AM/PM coconut oil this week. 
329 2018-04-10 23:25:14 If one more mofo at napa brings me an air filter when I ask for an oil filter I'm going to lose it.
330 2018-04-10 23:25:12 Oil is super fucking hot yoo
331 2018-04-10 23:25:11 Ah yes, "we have no proof of him killing folks en masse but he doesn't let us sell our oil to Europe so he's a mass murderer worthy of removal". Pretty sure my aunts made soup for the soldiers patrolling the streets in the winter snow.
332 2018-04-10 23:25:05 BC buys billions per year in oil from Alberta. Time to #BoycottAlbertaOil

339 2018-04-10 23:24:40 Dershowitz has been conned by the best snake oil salesman since PT Barnum. 

Everyone Donnie touches turns to shit.
340 2018-04-10 23:24:28 Our corporate nation has two major problems. One, the USA LLC has soldiers in only 74 out of 194 countries. The other, our global economy runs on the petrodollar and the USA LLC does not control all the oil.
341 2018-04-10 23:24:18 $spx Opened a small position in copper, gas and oil service equipment. All are long term. No options. This is not trading advice.
342 2018-04-10 23:24:18 Bit of olive oil and squeeze lemon over it 
343 2018-04-10 23:24:16 Just another ripoff by oil companies! We have the oil and when times are rough they cry to govs and taxpayers! THEN ...turn around and screw us!!
344 2018-04-10 23:24:15 The "infuse the hot oil with dried chilies" step in making kung pao chicken is great for this. Just great.
345 2018-04-10 23:24:13 Monetizing #FakeNews. Caribou not at all resilient in the face of spillover predation from wolves on moose, accentuated by oil & gas seismic lines.
346 2018-04-10 23:24:08 ewww oregano smells kind of like oil of oregano
347 2018-04-10 23:24:07 I think Congress only wants to regulate it because you can google “oil”

350 2018-04-10 23:23:34 America isn't concerned about 'helping civilians', they just want control of the Middle East, and more profits for arms/oil companies.
351 2018-04-10 23:23:31 We must expand oil and gas extraction to save the planet.... OK Orwell. Freedom is Slavery. #stopKM
352 2018-04-10 23:23:27 So is having #Zuckerberg sit with congress to write tech privacy policy basically like having big oil write environmental policy?
353 2018-04-10 23:23:15 Sorry I don't think you understand protectionism.... The United States won't buy our oil.....  So we gotta send it either west ( the most efficient) north through the artic. Or east to the Atlantic.... #cdnpoli it's never smart to only have one customer...
354 2018-04-10 23:23:09 The future of this world is oil free, let’s start now, I’m looking at you, Alberta. #StopTransMountain
355 2018-04-10 23:23:05 Yeah grapeseed oil has definitely helped. Cooking these brussel sprouts are trouble though.
356 2018-04-10 23:22:55 @PnPCBC  That should have been Robyn Allan.  Sorry about the misspelling of her name but she is a knowledgeable speaker to the oil pipeline debate.
357 2018-04-10 23:22:53 I'm guessing there's nothing to gain in Syria for the West,not like the oil fields in Kuwait, Iraq etc doesn't make it right
358 2018-04-10 23:22:46 Not at all! It seems part of the secret is to not over work the dough and make sure the earth balance or coconut oil is cold when you cut it in
359 2018-04-10 23:22:33 Put a sharpened blade on the mower after I finished changing the oil, air filter, and spark plug. Then I gave our lawn the first mowing of the season!
360 2018-04-10 23:22:32 Yes. He was just trying to sell you oil.
361 2018-04-10 23:22:12 Not true. Long term you say? How many European Cups have city won? How many League titles? When the oil money runs out they will be back in league 1 like they were before the Arabs came along
362 2018-04-10 23:22:12 need to oil up my whole body, I’m peeling so bad 
363 2018-04-10 23:21:59 These bastered corrupt politions has raped he country without using oil.
364 2018-04-10 23:21:51 Find it ironic that cdn dollar strengthened on jobs report that was all public sector and higher oil that we can’t get to mkt!!!!!!
365 2018-04-10 23:21:43 Even with that tax take, it'll last about 5 minutes when you start nationalising.  Where are you proposing to stop, Water?  Electricity Generation, Distribution and Trading?  Gas Exploration, Production, Distribution and Trading?  With Gas comes Oil, that'll have to be included?

371 2018-04-10 23:20:54 Oil is now over $71 a barrel. Never mind we have WM to look after it for us. They won't squander it I'm sure & Scotland will get all the benefits of having it. 
372 2018-04-10 23:20:46 $3 bucks up in a range bound market and peeps tweeting at me triple digit oil tweets ..LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL we haven't gone anywhere all year
373 2018-04-10 23:20:43 I've read a little about the pipelines but the strategic importance of them and Syria isn't important enough for what you are suggesting in my opinion, especially now that the US is producing so much of its own oil. I understand the concept, I just don't believe in the conspiracy
374 2018-04-10 23:20:39 Oil change
375 2018-04-10 23:20:25 No impeachment because the banks need a Trumpster to fight for peak oil derivitive debt. Why did he just call Qatar an ally in terror? Check out leviathan gas field-pipeline through Syria. Why are we at war? Dark money and the @federalreserve @WellsFargo @GoldmanSachs are evil.
376 2018-04-10 23:20:22 やっぱり陰キャだからなのかな……
377 2018-04-10 23:20:14 Use lower heat if it's burning before the insides can cook, and use an oil with a high burning point, like grapeseed
378 2018-04-10 23:20:12 Iran and Iraq have that oil too.  I think its having big friends. 
Saudis biggest friend has murdered 20mil civilians since end of WW2 so the kingdom is learning the blood craft well.
379 2018-04-10 23:20:07 Don't know what CBD oil is but glad you got off the Valium, trouble with medicine is it just treats the symptoms not the causes.

392 2018-04-10 23:18:38 This threat is pathetic "Notley said she will introduce legislation that would let Alberta reduce oil flows to B.C., restricting domestic supplies of gas that would send already high prices at the pumps soaring and leave B.C. consumers and businesses bearing the brunt of impact

398 2018-04-10 23:18:00 My point?  The government there believed in controlling the economy and they relied solely on oil. No other exports. This is where your marxist philosophy leads. No need to experiment with it any more. Too much proof it is wrong
399 2018-04-10 23:17:49 Kenn! We have our very own olive oil expert, Philli! She’ll have the answers. 
400 2018-04-10 23:17:30 Current federal government has been a formidable barrier to Energy East, northern gateway pipeline and petronas LNG development.   It appears this Trans Mountain ball is in the hands of your government Premier Notley.   Alberta oil and gas business seriously undermined.

413 2018-04-10 23:16:19 Only a fraction of Alberta's "current livelihood" derives from the oil and gas industry. Alberta is about more than this industry, as important as it is.

Gov left it alone for a long time so it could grow. But now there is so much bad software, so many breaches, so much data mishandling regulation is coming. Just like the FDA came for snake oil.

423 2018-04-10 23:15:02 thank you Pam.
How weak is #Alberta if a tar sand oil pipeline does not expand then Alberta's economy will crush? how much $$ is the selling of crude oil to world markets worth to Canadians, ahmm not to foreign oil owners! to the Canadians?

428 2018-04-10 23:14:50 I agree, they built the economy and tax structure on oil which was great until like 10 years ago. I just wish more of the so-called fixes like lottery and casino would have actually turned money out as promised.
429 2018-04-10 23:14:46 If I had the extra $’s I would pay off your entire student loan just for the fun of watching the meltdown.
430 2018-04-10 23:14:44 Like girl, that’s not “dew”, that’s an oil slick. Please fix.
431 2018-04-10 23:14:35 i use coconut oil religiously
432 2018-04-10 23:14:33 I can’t wait for the day when I rep pub/client side and get to take a big fat dump on snake oil vendors at conferences. (Unless it’s actually not a shit product)
433 2018-04-10 23:14:25 What if they use something else? Say boiling water or boiling oil? Then what?
434 2018-04-10 23:14:14 Um R U  aware just a few short miles from U  in Washington State there is 5 refineries with 10x the tanker traffic, or the east coast several tankers deliver blood oil (Saudi/Iranian) that supports terrorism
Or the fact you have enjoyed all the benefits of FF,S ur entire life
435 2018-04-10 23:14:13 Find your hot water hoses coming off the oil cooler,  shut them off,  your a/c should be much cooler  !

Got to get off oil.

When oil is irrelevant...

#tytlive
438 2018-04-10 23:13:48 The irony is rich: @RachelNotley (and @JustinTrudeau?) envision a new National Energy Program, for the benefit of US big oil.
439 2018-04-10 23:13:25 President Trump needs to end War despite what CIA wants! No more Syrian people dead because of oil pipelines!
440 2018-04-10 23:13:14 Hi @IcelandRichard, Thankyou for raising awareness of the devastating effects of Palm Oil deforestation - here’s hoping other supermarkets follow suit! #PalmOilAlarmCall
441 2018-04-10 23:13:11 As far as robots go I think we should put vegetable oil under the flubber of the skin so it looks real and the robot can move better
442 2018-04-10 23:13:07 Use eucalyptus oil, same ingredient in Vick’s but add it to a bath or in the shower, opens alla that up 
443 2018-04-10 23:12:58 I’d like to see an end to taxpayer funded subsidies to giant corps make a billion bucks a day. I’d like to see oil companies pay a deposit to clean up orphaned wells. I’d like to see an end to private profits through public losses.
444 2018-04-10 23:12:51 WTF Really???? lol What a joke and waste of money, how long with traffic will the the paint stay. Well I guess painters have steady work for a while.  I bet they will impose fines on cars that leak oil and lock of the owners of leaky cars,  unsightly cars, Yeah that's the ticket
445 2018-04-10 23:12:50 @JustinTrudeau 
Please stop supporting the KM pipeline and stick to your promises. Oil is the wrong move. Jobs are better supported in renewable. Look to other countries. We don’t have to support the lowest common denominator. Support BC. Don’t be a bully.
446 2018-04-10 23:12:42 Probably use that wild growth oil folks be talking about

449 2018-04-10 23:12:04 Yes, oil is a toxic substance. We need to dramatically decrease our use of it so it does not pollute our air and water.
450 2018-04-10 23:12:01 Running an engine that is cold and with settled oil causes the damage. Once the engine is warm and the oil properly distributed, the only extra stress is on the starter system.
451 2018-04-10 23:11:54 How about equal industry fairness?
Civil servants are over paid - bleeding tax payers dry with unfair pension benefits.  
The oil industry is unfairly burden with regulations compared to any other sector (auto and aerospace)
452 2018-04-10 23:11:44 Poppin shit like vegetable oil
453 2018-04-10 23:11:29 @NicolaSturgeon my wife is taking cannabis oil for a brain tumour, to date just over £50k we have spent on this, 3 years ago she was given 3 month to live and still going strong the oil has shrunk the tumour and dropped it to a grade 3 do some good with the power you have #help
454 2018-04-10 23:11:27 Reporting Scotland are still scratching their heads that the rising price of oil has damaged their claim of a £16bn independent Scottish deficit.
455 2018-04-10 23:11:22 ££££ probably. That oil’s not drying up

I just don’t want Trump and his cohorts claiming fracking for oil is following natural processes. 
Watch this space. 
You heard it here first. 

459 2018-04-10 23:10:59 (1) Likelihood of a trade war btw China and US, tax cuts, interest rates hikes in the US, ECB pushing to end quantitative easing, oil prices trending upwards are some of the factors that will affect stock globally. In Nigeria, I believe that with d kind of rally in d stock markt

465 2018-04-10 23:10:10 I’m very familiar with the 80’s bust & OK oil.

Also, know that OK production costs are ~equal to those in TX, after all... it’s the same field.

Oklahoma’s GPT is less because #okleg figured out how to write exemptions 4 donations.  IMO, that’s criminal.
466 2018-04-10 23:09:42 We should be protesting where BC actually gets it oil from! ;)
467 2018-04-10 23:09:37 It's fantasy that the Clyde basin is one of the largest oil fields ever discovered, that oil is a finite resource, which is used in thousands of product or you with your head in a book?
Goodnight 
468 2018-04-10 23:09:35 Tensions w/US & RU over Syria- Russia is the only one of the two that has permission to be there & is there legally. US (Pentagon) has no interests in Syria except assassinating Assad & taking the oil. DJT we're pulling out- Pentagon we're setting up bases, here comes fake attack

470 2018-04-10 23:09:12 Its time to promote all the good that comes from the Canadian oil industry and all that it does to make life better in Canada. #buildkm
471 2018-04-10 23:09:01 I love how curly and thick my hair is right after I wash it. The only products I use is organic coconut oil to moisturise and argan oil conditioner. Nothing else needed. Ooh and I braid my hair into protective hairstyles like cornrows. Plus my hair only needs washing once a week.
472 2018-04-10 23:08:58 The surest and most sustainable way to grow our foreign reserves(including actual savings like ECA), is export.

Not commodity export as we've seen how our ass gets open when oil prices fluctuate. We need to sell something to the world.

Tourism, technology, agriculture?
473 2018-04-10 23:08:36 lol sure it does.... yeah, they can remove the government in BC too, and end democracy, and lock up half the voters too.....

Hey, if you dont like it, be quiet. Time for the army to enforce oil company needs.
474 2018-04-10 23:08:28 Also excellent would be criminal liability for corporate misbehavior that causes direct physical harm to people, other living things, ecosystems. Might reduce the numbers of oil spills, chemical spills, industrial accidents and other disasters.
475 2018-04-10 23:08:10 Nice to see well spaced trees in grass pruned to classic  vase shape to let in light...more worried about lipophilic insecticides and fungicides in a 1x malaxed oil than I am about fraud.Easy to test for EVOO  fraud ...a red herring
476 2018-04-10 23:08:05 According to Trudeau &  Notley, it's vital the Kinder Morgan pipeline is built so we can export our oil that is destroying the planet via global warming. See what happens when your energy policy is developed by political scientists, instead of actual scientists and engineers?

480 2018-04-10 23:07:44 @IcelandFoods Great news Iceland, thanks for removing Palm Oil from your products. Good to see some companies putting the planet/animals and sustainability first. #PalmOilAlarmCall
481 2018-04-10 23:07:18 I wonder if anybody knows about the toxic waste dump in the city of South Gate. In 1973 there was a fire at a refinery on Garfield Avenue south of Firestone. We buried all the oil by products under the parking lot east of Garfield, north of Stewart and gray Road.
482 2018-04-10 23:07:14 The US is only interested in the oil pipeline. That's what their Wall St backers want. They only care about making money. They don't give a rats rear end about the people of Syria (or anywhere else, for that matter). In fact, they are responsible for the war. #disastercapitalism

502 2018-04-10 23:04:20 But is that a solution? They want to get rid of Assad and take over the oil mines in Syria. They did it before in Libya, the only African country that had no debt, in fact US and UK owed them.

508 2018-04-10 23:04:00 oil change in the morning, relax a lil while, hair done, and then home to do some birthday|weekend prepping.
509 2018-04-10 23:03:49 go to a natural health food store. Get wellness formula/ginger tea/oregano oil. Lots of herbal tea with honey & lemon. U should be good (no dairy) till u get better.
510 2018-04-10 23:03:49 Sorry Bish @BishBlueHammer but however much oil money gets thrown at city you will never ever ever ever come close to Liverpool. Got a ticket for the semis if you or the huge city following want it
511 2018-04-10 23:03:44 You just love seeing all our oil go down south to the Treasury where they then give crumbs back to Scotland. You really must hate Scotland to see us shafted like this for so many years, #MacCroneReport
512 2018-04-10 23:03:25 Now that it's in the rearview, can we all admit that the Iraq War was fought primarily for Israeli strategic interests? We never found the WMD's and in the end, we didn't even TAKE the oil. So even the "war for oil" meme is out the window. What else could it have been?

517 2018-04-10 23:02:42 Oil is worth nothing. Oil fields are a hindrance. Oil fields cost money. You're ruined if your strike oil. If you ever find oil in your country, give control of it to the country next door. They'll sort it for you, even though they don't want to. They're just really kind.

I suggest you get your head in to a book.

536 2018-04-10 23:00:50 Buying more than 20x the daily oil trade volume (let alone 164 days worth of US oil production) in “30 seconds” seems a bit far fetched.
537 2018-04-10 23:00:49 May it be noted that nobody cared about that uprising until Assad shot at the mercenaries( today ISIS). And it’s Wurope buying their oil, that’s why Obama sanctioned Russia. Obama then ran to the UNSC claiming that Assad was killing protesters. FALSE!

551 2018-04-10 22:58:40 In Bitcoin's case, the bubble is caused more I think by the fact that the supply is absolutely limited, which leads to these speculative booms.

There are bubbles in oil, but they'll never be as big as the Bitcoin bubble because untimely you can just get more oil.
552 2018-04-10 22:58:16 Oh no it's almost like how that naturally formed oil rose to the surface in the past...
553 2018-04-10 22:57:56 And they are also funded by big oil.
554 2018-04-10 22:57:54 Clearly you missed my point because all those "incursions" gave NATO and the US access to oil reserves. So their interference wasn't genuine but corruption at its best. Libya is far worse off now than it was under Gaddafi.

561 2018-04-10 22:57:24 Given the recent rumors confirmed to be untrue about an oil spill on Standing Rock, we should all give pause to the very frightening position that our people, lands and waters are in. Any day could begin the end of our homeland as we know it. #nodapl #cleanwatercampaign
562 2018-04-10 22:57:09 I’ll repeat what I’ve said multiple times. It’s not about using our own product. It’s about getting our oil to tidal water in the best interest of the nation.
563 2018-04-10 22:56:55 I hate when I get my eyebrows done cause they just itch right after cause I’m allergic to the oil they use
564 2018-04-10 22:56:27 Truly, data is the new oil.
565 2018-04-10 22:56:27 Oil should go up with conflict in Syria ?
566 2018-04-10 22:56:26 Ha! The "snake oil" vendor's clientele base has gotten quite fancy now with suits and work dresses, lmao!! #SimplementeMaria

568 2018-04-10 22:56:19 More useless lip-service. I guess #ClimateBarbie wants more oil tanker trucks on the road, so that she can impose even more carbon tax on the transportation costs. #TrudeauMustGo
569 2018-04-10 22:56:08 I fear the trajectory of health sciences in this administration will have the  FDA approving snake oil as a legitimate "cure all" 
570 2018-04-10 22:56:08 Bro, broiled broccoli.
Lay it on a cookie sheet, brush all the pieces with olive oil, then salt and pepper. Then broil all that shiz in the oven for like, iunno, 5 minutes
571 2018-04-10 22:56:06 Got an extra new oil pen if anyone wants to buy it $45
572 2018-04-10 22:55:52 BAKERS: So.... I kinda forgot to add the 1/4c oil to my GF cinnamon bread... which is already rising and ready for the oven.  What should I expect? A loaf of Sahara? Bland-city? #IscrewedUp #NeedHelpPlease!

576 2018-04-10 22:55:13 Rather significant on many levels: Iraqi govt. filed lawsuit against KRG at Iraq's federal court for selling Kurdistan's oil since 2014. After 1st session, judge postponed case to May 6. The KRG initiated oil sales after Baghdad cut the allocated budget for the region in 2014.
577 2018-04-10 22:55:11 Is that a bottle of olive oil?
578 2018-04-10 22:55:02 Surprisingly I doubt Facebook could be broken up unlike good old Standard Oil. #OOTT
579 2018-04-10 22:54:53 Longterm- eco friendly green energy development & projects. Oil, fracking, coal etc- the Environment cannot sustain the destruction. We owe it to our children & their children etc. What good is $ now if there's nothing left for future generations?

581 2018-04-10 22:54:45 Firestone blowup anniversary on the way. Whenever I think about how trustworthy the Colorado oil and gas industry is, I think Martinez Family.
582 2018-04-10 22:54:43 One of the reasons I am glad I left there. The oil industry of course says fracking has nothing to do with the earthquakes. They lie.
583 2018-04-10 22:54:43 Oil and gas production is down 65% on the 1990 peak, demand is set to plummet with the changes to cars and drive towards renewables for energy generation. North Sea costs are the highest in the world. Suggest you get your head out of the sand!
584 2018-04-10 22:54:41 It never fails I always end up getting more than an oil change
585 2018-04-10 22:54:37 Pls tell me what Yar Adua would have done better in stabilizing the exchange rate, bearing in mind the crash in oil prices and Nigeria's dependence on oil revenue.

590 2018-04-10 22:54:26 @lala_kent Thanks to you, I now sleep it’s Vaseline under my eyes every night since that episode aired!  I’ve also started using coconut oil on my face because you reminded me how important the face is and the night time routines! 
591 2018-04-10 22:54:17 I use oil in my day to day life very rarely.
592 2018-04-10 22:54:09 Teachers in OK are poorly paid in a poor state, despite the wealth being collected by oil/gas industries. OK must choose like WV did, between Senior services and Education. But if the OK legislature hadn’t given corporate tax cuts, the mess would be less.
593 2018-04-10 22:54:08 Butter and lard do damage rainforests. Way more so than palm oil. It's like taking one step forward and ten steps back.
594 2018-04-10 22:53:56 $SPY still 90% cash; no overnight option holds, key drivers:
<2700 -- political uncertainty, fear of trade rhetoric, digital ad regulation
<2800 -- 4 rate hikes
<3000 -- debt levels
>2580 -- earns expectations, global growth (oil+), good valuation
595 2018-04-10 22:53:52 World oil demand is 97 million barrels a day forcast to increase to 110 million barrels a day as the third world pull out of poverty. Big oil alwys wins you will have to accept that fact
596 2018-04-10 22:53:38 Everything is wrong with the entire situation. It does have value. It is a prime example of what would be a far left government, that pie in the sky heaven on earth socio commie snake oil promise believed by the unwary and those who want mom's.

601 2018-04-10 22:53:14 If you’re vegan then palm oil shouldn’t be on@your list of things to consume.
602 2018-04-10 22:53:07 Everyone is laughing when pressure was on you pissed the pants like a small club !!!!! You on for the treble oh sorry that’s gone I think oh spend more oil money like they do in the empty  you choked when pressure was on!!!!!!
603 2018-04-10 22:52:55 You need to understand the nature of our oil and gas industry.  Most all of the production here is marginal, meaning it's expensive to produce.  For a good perspective, read about the oil bust of the 80s and what that did to our economy.  GPT taxes are low for a reason.

609 2018-04-10 22:52:21 Today is a good day to remember JT's words: "Oil spills like the Vancouver fuel spill are of serious concern to British Columbians and all Canadians. A Liberal government will reopen the Vancouver Coast Guard station and reverse the damage of Mr. Harper’s cuts to marine safety"
610 2018-04-10 22:52:09 I just need this Mexican man to do my oil change $25 instead of 55 while he in my face flirting.
611 2018-04-10 22:51:51 well he eats hella healthy and literally works out everyone so dude doesn’t do it with a shit ton of oil and no I don’t like them because bananas are trash don’t start with me
612 2018-04-10 22:51:23 Is it really equal work, though?  Is waitressing the same as working on an off-shore oil platform?
613 2018-04-10 22:51:22 And why not make those products in Alberta rather than shipping the oil to China. Would create much added value.
614 2018-04-10 22:51:08 *whispers* The point is to get rid of the oil.

620 2018-04-10 22:50:40 And btw, my tweet referred to being long stocks, not Oil. Oil is going higher to 70s / 80s for a whole number of reasons imho, especially if all hell breaks loose in Syria.
621 2018-04-10 22:50:31 So how many Senators concerned with regulating Facebook are that concerned about regulating the oil industry, big pharma or Wall Street?

627 2018-04-10 22:49:55 I wonder if CBD oil would help.  Googled before I dared to tweet this.  Daughter in law just switched from pharma meds to CBD oil for anxiety issue. She told me her uncle’s Lung tumors are shrinking with CBD oil.

632 2018-04-10 22:49:00 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
633 2018-04-10 22:48:56 Today snake oil salesmen are selling a bogus currency on the Internet called Bitcoin to mislead the unwary that their product has been authenticated by the tried and true method used for gold authentication.

638 2018-04-10 22:48:23 I would think that if Saudis are stupid enough to bomb Syria, then they're fair game and their oil refineries should be bombed. That's the best way to bankrupt that terrorist head chopping regime.
639 2018-04-10 22:48:23 @GrassBased  maybe you could contribute to this discussion  ? The premise being we need to be vegetarian to save the planet.  You've got rather more of the research at your finger tips.  Im  celebrating the fact that Iceland is including lard  in its replacement of palm oil!
640 2018-04-10 22:48:18 Cried while getting an oil change, cried on the 670 bus from campus to riverside 
641 2018-04-10 22:48:16 It's HILARIOUS that the @liberal_party is trying to blame the oil pipeline companies for the delays.

You have no shame.

643 2018-04-10 22:48:09 And let us not forget that it has been the gas and oil sector of our economy that has carried Canada this past 20 years or so
644 2018-04-10 22:48:04 TA: spilling oil on yourself sucks, spilling oil on a classmate is minus 10 points, and as always spilling oil on me is a automatic fail for the lab.
645 2018-04-10 22:48:03 This ‘Texas Oil Company’ saw fit to place snow fence in salmon habitat to prevent spawning!!  That sounds like environmentally responsible behaviour!!
646 2018-04-10 22:47:59 Would someone please justify the increase?  Prices never came down with winter gas.  Just another rape and pillage form the oil companies and our government
647 2018-04-10 22:47:57 The instability of oil prices and Nigeria's import consumption habit will always make this growth in foreign reserves unsustainable.
648 2018-04-10 22:47:47 TMX gets a pipeline for free, Alberta pushes the pipeline through the government & takes the majority of risks & TMX operates pipeline. This was TMX best outcome and Alberta gets its oil to market.

664 2018-04-10 22:46:34 You have no clue how the oil business works do you? They have come a very long ways from the days that you seem to think they operate under today.
665 2018-04-10 22:46:34 I agree.  Might be time for some "Trust Busting" - although if memory serves, that was a rather hamhanded approach to Standard Oil's near monopoly, which was starting to fray at the edges.
666 2018-04-10 22:46:26 President Donald Trump Biafra is happy you have supported Biafra Independence. Mr President cut off the funding of Boko Haram terrorists group now by Biafra oil being returned to us urgently. God bless America

677 2018-04-10 22:45:20 Pretty much all the energy that we use came from the sun, including oil. Plus my comment was on using oil for fuel. Burning less oil for fuel will save it for better uses as well as lower the cost of those item.

683 2018-04-10 22:44:32 You obviously know nothing about the original subject. Palm Oil is the biggest cause of deforestation, particularly rain forests, that account for 50% of bio diversity.

689 2018-04-10 22:44:01 Jason if you knew what you were talking about, this conversation would be different. Not one drop of the "oil" in the new pipeline is for anyone in Canada. Why build something that is not in our best interests?

691 2018-04-10 22:43:48 Don’t worry , Alberta doesn’t give a fuck what Quebec thinks about the pipeline while it takes 11 b more in transfer payments while claiming it has a balanced budget , what a farce . They will crumble without oil money#pnpcbc

701 2018-04-10 22:42:57 Ya know, it would’ve been amazing to learn about life things in high school Like how to change your oil, taxes, health insurance, and how to buy a house. At least I still have the quadratic equation song still memorized 
702 2018-04-10 22:42:56 @azureacademia Hey! Vet appointment today and lots of great convos about how the CBD oil is working/helping Jack. Feeling so grateful you mentioned it to me!
703 2018-04-10 22:42:52 Wayyo Barca get haters wella o ,na today I know...
704 2018-04-10 22:42:46 I guess the protesters all went home by their gas driven cars to their heated homes by gas or oil what a bunch of hipocrits All of them are going to pay higher gas and oil prices because of their stupidity towards Km
705 2018-04-10 22:42:36 @Roadwalking We provide information in many time frames, relating the time frames is key, we have never said or proposed selling Oil.
706 2018-04-10 22:42:24 Does big oil fund you?
707 2018-04-10 22:42:20 they were already in oil it got soaked up child
708 2018-04-10 22:42:11 I accidentally used distilled white vinegar in the fryer instead of extra Virgin olive oil. 
I do not recommend you do this.
709 2018-04-10 22:42:10 you wish
710 2018-04-10 22:42:07 Fiscal only when it comes to the poor, the elderly, the teachers but when it comes to tanks, oil and feeding a billionaire spend away!
711 2018-04-10 22:42:00 getting an oil change is ass 100% bc of waiting in the lobby, it’s 600% ass when you have to sit by some republicans
712 2018-04-10 22:41:56 I always feel like they guys changing my oil are talking shit about me.
713 2018-04-10 22:41:53 Oil spills are a huge risk to the economy of BC. Plus huge opportunity cost for Canada and Alberta of continuing economic dependence on oil. Need to develop the diverse economy of the future.
714 2018-04-10 22:41:51 Oil is going higher for multiple reasons imho, incl #Syria. 70s, 80s until crash later this year takes it down. Precious Metals and the Dollar likely to benefit too - safe havens. But stocks are the risk asset that will likely get hit imo.
715 2018-04-10 22:41:39 Shell Oil reports largest rise in Greenhouse Gases since 2014 Wayto go Pruitt
716 2018-04-10 22:41:35 Mix it like it says for the face, using apple cider vinegar, you can put some oil or conditioner in it someone else said they did it that way, and the hair comes out much curlier (if you have curly hair) and shiny and soft. My daughter does it once a week her hair looks great
717 2018-04-10 22:41:18 Do y’all know how much power there is in coconut oil 
718 2018-04-10 22:41:15 Lol - we sang lots at our protests to #stopkm!  Oh Canada - our home and Native land - let’s keep it beautiful and free of oil spills!  Free for #FirstNation peoples ! Free for good jobs with #GreenEnergy ! Selling out to foreign investors is not patriotic!
719 2018-04-10 22:40:51 Oil use,according to IEA will increase to 105mbpd in 2040 from 96 mbpd  now.
720 2018-04-10 22:40:48 Are you kidding me? Do you know how much oil goes from Alaska to the lower 48? Every day and you are none the wiser. We need to get this oil to Asia, more refineries in Canada will not do anything as you can only ship that so far via trucking.
721 2018-04-10 22:40:44 Well, maybe. He did smell like motor oil. But this was mostly for the good fun times in the shower.

Hopefully neither of them would slip.
722 2018-04-10 22:40:43 Hi Tim, English person here.. I think you might have been sold some snake oil there, friend

725 2018-04-10 22:40:23 Last night Taylor was helping me make brownies and this hoe put half a cup of OLIVE OIL into the batter when the recipe called for half a cup of VEGETABLE OIL and those brownies came out the oven tasting like olive oil...I’m bitter I had to throw the whole batch out smh
726 2018-04-10 22:40:13 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
727 2018-04-10 22:39:45 We’ve stuck our noses in so many other affairs why would the sake of human life be one to get involved in right...funny when nothing’s gained but a pat on the back instead of gold and oil
728 2018-04-10 22:39:37 Alaskans own 20,922 shares of CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORP, worth $314,667. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
729 2018-04-10 22:39:34 They said all they did was drop the oil pan, refill it and it drove fine for like 13 miles  didn’t drive it in manual yet though so that could still have a problem but we’ll wait and see the bill isn’t even 100 dollars yet we’re really thriving so far 
730 2018-04-10 22:39:29 What’s castor oil?
731 2018-04-10 22:39:21 No BS Supplements that are worth purchasing and are scientifically  backed~

-protein powder
-fish oil
-multi vitamin 
-creatine (just get regular monohydrate, fancier ones charge more for almost no reason) 
-some form of pre workout caffeine (or just coffee)

742 2018-04-10 22:38:35 Medical marijuana, cannabis oil and the like are not the same as roasting a bong with Spicoli - that’s the problem is so many seem them as the exact same thing & they just aren’t.
743 2018-04-10 22:38:35 Federal police blame Dilma for wrongdoing in Pasadena. According to the expert report, the surcharge paid by Petrobras to Belgian Astra Oil was US $ 741 million. Focus on you

746 2018-04-10 22:38:05 Well done @IcelandFoods for your stance on palm oil products. Will you also veto all branded foods using palm oil too?

Try palm oil, beef, water, any natural resources or precious metals. this is an utterly shit statement.
756 2018-04-10 22:36:58 Try genie oil @Wikipedia
757 2018-04-10 22:36:45 Nada. Las oil paintings. 
758 2018-04-10 22:36:35 Yes to oil + butter, started in skillet and transferred to oven.
759 2018-04-10 22:36:29 What about the zakat we used to give you before the oil?
760 2018-04-10 22:36:17 olive oil is my best friend
761 2018-04-10 22:36:00 You’re going to need oil and gas to clean that shit up
762 2018-04-10 22:35:55 The less you moisturize your face the more oil it’ll typically produce. I’m oily too so usually I use the shea butter in my night routine!
763 2018-04-10 22:35:53 not a prevention but oil absorption sheets or blotting sheets are a god send throughout the day but if you ever find something that prevents it let me know

769 2018-04-10 22:35:13 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
770 2018-04-10 22:34:52 That a stupid statement when the west is milking oil in the middle east and destabilizing for political influence. How about getting f out of middle east
771 2018-04-10 22:34:52 I need a good beard oil 
772 2018-04-10 22:34:41 Are you using a high temp oil (like avocado) to start then finishing/basting with butter? Oven or just in the pan? (Inquiring minds want to know :-))
773 2018-04-10 22:34:33 That’s a steal compared to the $240K they’re paying to figure out why the oil sands are lagging behind (as they run out of meetings about Trans Mountain...).
774 2018-04-10 22:34:32 Lol my mother dey baf me with anointing oil. I cannot fail
775 2018-04-10 22:34:02 Coconut oil is actually doing wonders for my skin but making me hairy as fuck
776 2018-04-10 22:33:59 We cater our evening primrose oil and extract from the US and it is a star ingredient in our night serum, The Lasting Forever.
777 2018-04-10 22:33:52 Rich in essential fatty acids, but also in vitamins E and F, evening primrose oil is extremely beneficial for the feminine balance and the overall skin health. Protects the most delicate of the skin, reducing wrinkles and imperfections by delaying the ravages of time and gravity.
778 2018-04-10 22:33:50 @Honda does not warn when oil change package expires. I had one left but can’t use it bcz it expired last month without me knowing 
779 2018-04-10 22:33:50 Her mind was a fairground ride
Whirling cogs and flashing lights
Screams to go faster
The scent of candy floss
In the air
In her hair
Men drenched in oil lurk
In the shadows
Whilst the shining facade
Distracts the onlooker
With blaring sounds
And fairy twinkles

780 2018-04-10 22:33:47 e.g. glycerine + cetyl alcohol + vegetable oil + water (lots) and food mixer 
these products are often 80% water
781 2018-04-10 22:33:21 Oil constitutes about 95% of Nigeria's general revenue.
782 2018-04-10 22:33:18 You can tax oil and gas out of existence.  What then?
783 2018-04-10 22:33:18 All your food is hauled by electricity too? And not everyone has an electric car. BC will cave pretty quickly when the pipes stop flowing oil west
784 2018-04-10 22:33:05 Manchester city is not that special. High tempo attacking which had bambuzzed most teams. But respond found out. Liverpool man utd and now Liverpool . Tonight ran out of steam by second half. Man Utd  fan but really  loved it. Oil rid dismantled
785 2018-04-10 22:32:57 Oil....yet again!!
786 2018-04-10 22:32:57 I wish i could drop oil slicks and jax when niggas is tailgating me
787 2018-04-10 22:32:56 Oil jumped to the highest since 2014 after Saudi Arabia was said to seek higher prices and amid the overall risk-on mood in markets. The Saudis want to get oil prices near $80 a barrel to pay for the government’s crowded policy agenda #OilPrice #OilNews @OPECnews
788 2018-04-10 22:32:55 Trump laid down the law China caved as predicted. Trade treaties should now be negotiable and placed in writing. Auto tariffs and more imports by American Companies . Trade balance could be closer with oil and natural gas sold in the future.
789 2018-04-10 22:32:30 Y’all don’t forget to moisturize your hands and get some oil on those cuticles.
790 2018-04-10 22:32:29 It’ll be a case of massively hard choices around pensions, social services, the NHS, council service, higher taxes. Wealthy people and businesses will flee south to protect their wealth. That’s the reality. Not some Oil/Whisky/Brigadoon fantasy.
791 2018-04-10 22:32:27 Nah, it's only an issue if it annoys me, and it doesn't. Similarly, I never put petrol in my car, check the tyres, oil, etc. I just get in and drive. They look after that for me. We play to our strengths.
792 2018-04-10 22:32:25 It is clear from #Zuckerburg's testimony that if data is the new oil,  the lack of privacy is the new carbon emissions
793 2018-04-10 22:32:24 Zuckerberg ‘killing the clock’ because no one in Congress is smart enough to ask an intelligent line of questions. Dog and pony show-first the oil companies, then the banks and now big tech-nothing accomplished.

795 2018-04-10 22:32:11 You're not even worth my time just enjoy supporting your club that can't fill a stadium and is only relevant because of all that oil money.
796 2018-04-10 22:31:56 If u r doing this blasphemy it would b counter productive to b asking for salvation. Oil & water
797 2018-04-10 22:31:39 Best beard oil ever. Period.
798 2018-04-10 22:31:35 .Somebody give the names of some good beard oil ....I need my shit lavish b
799 2018-04-10 22:31:32 Yah, hot water for heating is uncommon here, esp in the past 50 years.  We have big bulky gas furnace, oil burners, or electric heat pump with forced air (lotsa duct work). Hot water heaters are big storage tanks (30-50gal) although on-demand units are becoming more popular.
800 2018-04-10 22:31:24 Pipelines facilitate oil patch.

804 2018-04-10 22:31:11 Well Doug, you drink all the snake oil you’d like. Other Doug does hide from the media and does have a record of lies and fiscal irresponsibility due to not understanding facts. You can call me a troll if you’d like but, it really doesn’t mean anything.
805 2018-04-10 22:31:11 And you have a couple screws loose since you are not willing to listen to concerns of North Burnaby residents, students, staff, and volunteers at SFU, all of whom have legitimate concerns with added oil storage tanks on the south side of Burnaby Mountain
806 2018-04-10 22:31:02 @JustinTrudeau @bcndp  Can you imagine if Quebec had oil sands and they needed to get a pipeline through a protesting Newfoundland? Trudeau would have had the military deployed yesterday.

816 2018-04-10 22:30:14 AHHH first oil painting today. Its so hard to blend smoothly;;; i resorted to smacking my flatbrush against the damn canvas.
817 2018-04-10 22:29:41 Yay! I'm so excited for you to try our CBD Oil. Cool Mint is always a refreshing experience 
818 2018-04-10 22:29:40 Many palm oil plantations are on carbon sinks, land comparable to peat and further exploitation of this kind is going on in Indonesia. Palm oil growth on burnt rainforest causes huge carbon release to the atmosphere and impacts on human health too.
819 2018-04-10 22:29:27 Bought 2 bottles of different fragrances of perfume oil. Both ain't shit, I miss my old dealer 
820 2018-04-10 22:29:22 The biggest threat is the bankers, followed by the defense contractors and the oil companies. The CIA and all these corrupt people in the FBI and DOJ are in league with them. Soros is a bag man for the CIA spreading dissent. Divide and conquer.

823 2018-04-10 22:28:48 I really would be applauding Iceland for cutting out palm oil if I wasn't a loud and proud Nutella eating cunt
824 2018-04-10 22:28:45 Understandable, when I did smoke I was always trying to be conscious of that kind of thing. 

Anyway my weed is actually an oil vape, bc I don't smoke much at a time. But either way, I know just mentioning it bothers some people which is why I try not to talk about it much.
825 2018-04-10 22:28:34 I see you. I went with the same hydrating base, hydrating and toning infusions, and chorella gold extra shot. I think I will try the prickly Pear oil next time. Overall I love it!
826 2018-04-10 22:28:32 気持ちは本気です！！！
827 2018-04-10 22:28:05 I had no idea of the abject cruelty done to orangutans until I saw a tweet last month. I've since stopped buying products w palm oil in them. I may not be successful in eliminating 100% of my consumption but advocacy does work.
828 2018-04-10 22:28:04 @McgoughRoger Just because you don't reply: did you see the palm oil tree/rain forest statistics in the i?? Did you see the elephant ivory statistics on TV tonight?? Bother you! Love Penny

831 2018-04-10 22:27:51 Set an appt for an oil change and a haircut look at me being a grown up
832 2018-04-10 22:27:48 In April, major manufacturers of silicone oil, DMC, clearly stated to the author: "In the future, market prices will continue to rise steadily for a long period of time, which is conducive to healthy development of the industry."
The newest price of DMC is 32.5-34 RMB/KG
833 2018-04-10 22:27:48 It's the internet... everybody is an expert in whatever they are talking about. The people who are truly successful don't need to worry about the haters. Enjoy the rocket to the moon in oil. Keep being awesome!

837 2018-04-10 22:27:15 Ramen while waiting for my oil change kinda gig! She gets things done AND treats herself!!
838 2018-04-10 22:27:13 I went to a Vietnamese restaurant to grab lunch and I ordered veggies and the amount of oil that was in it was so gross, and to make matters worse I thought I was eating sautéed tofu until I realized it was chicken, and now I’m very sick
839 2018-04-10 22:27:05 I tried olive oil, acetone, and a $20 gel remover from Amazon. They’re STILL THERE. And the others are stubby. AND the wind made them clump in my wedding photos. So that was a $200 exercise in failure.

843 2018-04-10 22:26:37 Federal police blame Dilma for wrongdoing in Pasadena. According to the expert report, the surcharge paid by Petrobras to Belgian Astra Oil was US $ 741 million. Focus on you
844 2018-04-10 22:26:33 It's a positive step, but we need to get them to stop supporting big oil and clean up their unfair lending practices, too.

Coat in olive oil, generous salt and pepper. 10 minutes in convection oven at 350/400 for non-convection.

Butter. (Bonus... herb butter - dill, chives, rosemary, garlic, softened butter in food processor. Some prep but you can make a lot to last for a bit).

851 2018-04-10 22:25:47 I don't understand this "I was tricked!" excuse.  I've known EXACTLY who 45* was since I was a child.  I've seen him on tabloid covers, in interviews, on tv.  He's been the same slimy snake oil salesman for decades.  If anyone tricked those ppl it was themselves.

856 2018-04-10 22:24:57 I wish I could be Tommy Blake and True Story! Cool! And is that an Oil Kings book in between them?
857 2018-04-10 22:24:38 That oil change took two damn hours. Guh.
858 2018-04-10 22:24:32 Regarding huge Data monopolies that effect and control all businesses: Facebook & Google get 99% of all internet online ad spends, which is on an order of magnitude that far exceeds John D. Rockefeller's monopoly in the oil markets.
859 2018-04-10 22:24:23 You finally made it. I always knew you would. There's so much love for you in this world "Oil Tot" that your followers are only going to continue to grow! Hugs for Josh! 
860 2018-04-10 22:24:12 But seriously, why do oil changes take 2 hours? ....I need to go home.
861 2018-04-10 22:24:10 Jesus fucking god I left my fish oil in my pocket and it all went through the wash. This is the third time now I’ve washed everything and it is NOT coming out
862 2018-04-10 22:24:07 Yeeeeahhh. UK not oil rich and hyperinflation basically impossible. Germany and Scandinavian countries are close to what UK Labour proposes.
863 2018-04-10 22:23:53 They say you’re not supposed to wash your hair every day, but then you got these people out here looking like they tryna sell their own personal oil or something
864 2018-04-10 22:23:47 I'll grab the Shea oil
865 2018-04-10 22:23:45 what value is there but in application

what value is in anything until it serves a purpose

value is a positive entity
oscillating around the net 0 of being
negative being a perceived lack
866 2018-04-10 22:23:20 why do indians, pakistanis and bengalis fight so much.. you're basically the same people separated only by the amount of oil you put in your curries.

870 2018-04-10 22:22:58 Oil does not come from dinosaurs.
871 2018-04-10 22:22:37 I'm an amateur trader, but is "what aboutism" like this an efficient way to trade? I see the potential downside geopolitical risk, but if a number of indicators are bullish should potential risk outweigh possible reward? Could long oil not also be an efficient risk hedge?
872 2018-04-10 22:22:36 I just bought a cool new Wii U Night time is a lie! The government is just blocking out the sun! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

875 2018-04-10 22:22:27 What a joke you don’t serve TX32, you serve yourself, the gun lobby and big oil in that order
876 2018-04-10 22:22:09 It’s all about building a pipeline for oil from Saudi A to Europe. Sadam Hussein said no! Look what happened. Assad said no! look what’s happening! The Globalists want to control Russia by eliminating their oil sales to Europe.
877 2018-04-10 22:22:07 // Okay qwq

Yes! It's something my mother and grandma always told me to do this in case I burned myself with coocking oil. Which I have.
878 2018-04-10 22:22:04 you retired. It’s sahra’s turn to find the oil.
879 2018-04-10 22:21:59 I’d like to oil up her tin man, if you know what I mean. Put my foot in her ruby slipper. Load brain in her scarecrow. Put some courage in her lion.

883 2018-04-10 22:21:37 What’s a better way to get the oil to market, then. Canadian grain is being held up because of all the rail carrying oil.
884 2018-04-10 22:21:31 The Indonesian port city of Balikpapan in Borneo has declared a state of emergency after an oil spill spread along the coast, killing several people.
885 2018-04-10 22:21:30 TOTAL?  What does the French oil giant have to do with it?
886 2018-04-10 22:21:20 You’d prefer to see a hundred thousand out of work in Ab. Sask. & Man? You’d prefer that BC get its oil from Wash.? How does gas at $2.50 or $3 a litre sound?
887 2018-04-10 22:20:59 Oh, you mean that agency that merely protects the air we breathe and the water we drink? The one the GOP is now furiously working to dismantle, headed by one of history's most blatantly corrupt pols, a guy who's both funded by the oil industry and ripping off taxpayers? That EPA?

890 2018-04-10 22:20:44 Garnier micellar water to clean dirt/makeup off, in the morning and/or at night depending on how much dirt and oil your face normally attracts. Dark angels from lush is a good exfoliant, and “just to clarify” is a good less harsh jelly mask. There’s also a clay mask available on
891 2018-04-10 22:20:42 Deadly oil spill devastates Borneo port city.
892 2018-04-10 22:20:32 It's funny. Niko has a nice looking family. We could probably all laugh and scratch and have a good time together at a picnic or pool party....but on Twitter we all want to boil each other in oil and roll one another  in salt!
893 2018-04-10 22:20:30 I don't shop in Iceland, but I definitely will shop their own brand if it is free from palm oil!
894 2018-04-10 22:20:22 I love how thick my brows are  castor oil works wonders! I don’t even need to fill them in
895 2018-04-10 22:20:16 Can't think of a more subsidised industry than oil. How many wars have tax payers funded for it?

906 2018-04-10 22:19:20 Ultimately it's the job of the Russian people to choose how they are governed. He's not a supervillain, and he's mortal.  One day they'll have another Yeltsin or the oil will run out. If you want to bug him, let Ukraine in the EU or root for a free democratic Kurdistan.

909 2018-04-10 22:18:48 Sure. I live on an island that depends on weekly barges for everything from food to oil to power our electric plant. There are quite a bit of people here who don't have emergency supplies or the knowledge to procure or produce their own food.
910 2018-04-10 22:18:37 Would like to thank @BrentwoodRFC @EssexPresident @RFUEssexTeam for hosting our event tonight. Big thank you to all the volunteers who came along tonight . All of you are the oil that keeps the cogs of our great game of rugby going THANK YOU ALL

917 2018-04-10 22:18:04 John Bolton? What do you think? He was part of the think tank back in '97 that masterminded the plan carried out in the Middle East. Together with men who are now on the board of Israeli company Genie energy, currently pumping op oil in the Golan. He is a Zionist warhawk.
918 2018-04-10 22:17:52 Mitch, all you care about is slush money in politics. You sold America out when you fought tooth and nail against Campaign Finance reform. You belong to the oil and coal barons, stop pretending there is anything patriotic about it!

921 2018-04-10 22:17:29 Me to Meineke workers: Here for an oil change, I want this $20 one. 
Meineke workers 3 hours later: Sorry for the wait. We gave you our synthetic oil for 80 bucks instead. Thanks man!
Fucking excuse me.
922 2018-04-10 22:17:23 yaaaaas I got 30 bucks off my oil change
923 2018-04-10 22:17:20 I had to know how to change a tire and change my oil before I got my car. Hell I know how to do more than that now. Maybe I was raised in the stone age or something 
924 2018-04-10 22:17:15 Please reconsider your position on the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion. Economics is important, of course, but I don't believe that getting oil to the coast from Alberta is worth the downside costs to the environment in Alberta, B.C. or the probable damage to our pristine coast.
925 2018-04-10 22:17:14 Will they find any info on his stake in Genie Oil? Shares in Golan Heights  (Syrian) mineral wealth sold to him illegally by Israel?  Sod it, let’s carry on looking for an excuse to bomb Assad. With his ‘news’ outlets most vocal in the cheerleading
926 2018-04-10 22:17:10 Many places are using coconut oil instead, meaning those allergic are now unable to eat foods they used to. Will this be the case for Iceland?

932 2018-04-10 22:16:29 #StupidQuestionsForTheIRS does avocado oil have a higher smoke point?
933 2018-04-10 22:16:27 Yes let's use moonbeams, gumdrops and unicorn farts. 
Until then How about we support the most ethical and environmentally  responsible oil and gas in the world while we strive for even better. #ethicalcanadianoil&gas
934 2018-04-10 22:16:16 Ice cube and crumble it or veggie oil and comb
935 2018-04-10 22:16:08 optimally we will give each other a bloody nose then take a step back -aside all dem bs - Putin Trump like water & oil
936 2018-04-10 22:15:50 Problem is 26 oil storage tanks near 10000s residents is too big of a risk, despite 'miniscule' chances it will explode.
937 2018-04-10 22:15:47 You ever watch ya boo clean himself up? Like brush the waves, oil the beard and allat. Gah
938 2018-04-10 22:15:46 Whip together 4 tsps cupcakes with 3 cups caviar. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve
939 2018-04-10 22:15:43 So. You want to import oil from the Middle East and South American countries that have absolutely no environmental standards and even less human rights. Tanker traffic will now increase 7 fold. WindPower failing, Solar power killing insects crucial to crop production in Korea. k

944 2018-04-10 22:15:31 I'm on my second bottle today I need to chill off the oil
945 2018-04-10 22:15:25 You’re welcome! I just started using the Argan oil one and it’s wonderful!
946 2018-04-10 22:15:18 I'd imagine the best solution then would be to replace it with a type of seed oil that can't be grown in tropical climates?
947 2018-04-10 22:15:16 FB has become the  Al Franken of blame and attack.  I am much more worried about breaches of banks, equifax, oil pipe lines, chemical plants.  Yes, things need to change but the real criminals are widespread trump corruption, Russia oligarchs, Cambridge Analytica, not naive SM.

952 2018-04-10 22:14:55 Made great progress today. We purchased an oil free compressor and a 6 head linear filler. After 11 months of planning and talking with plenty of people in the industry we are about to commence installation.
953 2018-04-10 22:14:47 We'd run water through to clean out fertilizer, found out the water would seep into the gear box. Have to change the oil each time.
954 2018-04-10 22:14:42 Add $$$ for new white tires change out and how to produce white oil and white oil carbons.
955 2018-04-10 22:14:35 So grateful my dad took my car to get an oil change while I was at work bc lord knows, I did not have time in schedule to do so
956 2018-04-10 22:14:30 Yes, and that’s another reason why historical binary comparison is pointless-the endless “where’s oor oil” is a non event- as I’ve said, field size, extraction costs, timing v price, & as you say ownership, all make post event comparison ultimately a pointless distraction

960 2018-04-10 22:14:08 They’re so expensive. I wish I could have a cuddly stuffed animal that looked like my dog and an oil painting of him too, but the moths that just flew out of my wallet are laughing at my ideas of fine art.

981 2018-04-10 22:11:38 10% = coffee, tea, chocolate, lemons, onions, garlic + limited olive oil, some herbs (curcumin, ginger, ashwagandha, boswellia). Wld love to establish some causality btwn these + sensitivities. Realizing only solution is to give 'em up + observe. Many thks.
982 2018-04-10 22:11:32 Oh I hope you feel better soon. If you havent already, peppermint oil helps a lot with 'normal' headaches imo
983 2018-04-10 22:11:26 that leaves me out i could use some maiden oil
984 2018-04-10 22:11:19 I think it was Cheney, frankly. He ordered the 'interrogations' to with the aim of backing up his scenario for war. I have no doubt that Bolton was in it up to his nose. 

One rumor I heard was hussein had put a hit on G. H. W., and there's always the standard fallback, oil
985 2018-04-10 22:11:19 @TB_Times uses much more oil in manufacturing, printing, handling,  and distributing their newspaper than any amount of plastic straws used in the metro area.  Not counting all the oil their employees use commuting.
986 2018-04-10 22:11:18 It is always fresh 
You cannot spoil it.
You'll not find it 
Floating in toilets.
When it is dry 
Sometimes you must oil it.
It's the epic bald head.
987 2018-04-10 22:11:10 Same so I got super excited when I saw that theyre vegan and cook it in vegetable oil on the website but it was the fricken French site :”(
988 2018-04-10 22:11:10 I once saw a man on the Tube eating a whole lettuce like it was an apple, but he was also drinking vegetable oil from a bottle and wearing a dressing gown, so ... yeah.
989 2018-04-10 22:11:07 Who needs oil?
990 2018-04-10 22:11:07 Exactly does the #USA care about Syria  anyways? It has nothing to do with you. So why the big fuzz? It’s because of the oil pipeline through Syria .
991 2018-04-10 22:11:00 give her mineral oil
992 2018-04-10 22:10:35 Name a replacement for oil.
993 2018-04-10 22:10:27 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
994 2018-04-10 22:10:23 @chrisbrown baby the baby boys been trying to catch some girls at school they be on me when it come to braiding they hair. They wanna be greased up so they be like Momma you know oil me up.

1002 2018-04-10 22:09:47 Can you have avocados? If so, avocado oil might work. It can be rather expensive, but I haven’t had to use as much of it as some other alternatives.
1003 2018-04-10 22:09:44 @CrowSNP One things for sure it's not abt their concern for the ppl in Syria. Money, oil, arms sales yes , ppls lives no
1004 2018-04-10 22:09:37 Yeah, and Scheer gives cover to white nationalists. I guess if I'm forced to choose... Hmm, trivially more expensive oil, or Nazis? Tough decision there guys.

1006 2018-04-10 22:09:28 isn’t Alberta oil extracted and transported to Vancouver for transpacific tanker to refine and burn in China better than China burning coal?
1007 2018-04-10 22:09:27 If you wish to establish safe zones around any organization, you need to gather support, lobby lawmakers, and get a specific law passed. I'm not sure why you want to forbid PRO-pipeline supporters in front of oil company offices.

1009 2018-04-10 22:09:21 As a United fan, I hate Liverpool. But, like United, it earned its status by winning, building a fan base, and managing the club well. Manchester City didn’t. It was bought by an oil barron and artificially made “great.” So, props to Liverpool tonight. #MUFC #LFC #MCFC
1010 2018-04-10 22:09:19 U can have your thoughts or opinions about CBD OIL but I know it has changed my life !

1012 2018-04-10 22:09:13 really love to get my oil changed and have all 14 mechanics come from the back office cus my car squeaks.
1013 2018-04-10 22:09:11 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1014 2018-04-10 22:09:10 I love the Fenty Match sticks ! I always use them in my appointments at Sephora.

I love to drop alittle Farsali oil on to the beauty blender to blend the contour!!

1015 2018-04-10 22:09:05 i always wonder that california is one of the state that mines oil but why gas price keeps going up and up???

1017 2018-04-10 22:08:56 @rickygervais Palm oil production is absolutely devastating. Please RT and raise awareness.

1020 2018-04-10 22:08:47 In case you have no interest in actually doing the Google search, the oil sands produce 2% of our GDP. Expanding tarsands will not make that go up hugely.
1021 2018-04-10 22:08:47 I'm on the sidelines for now other than very short term trades. Syria risk is hanging over a lot of trades now and I'm not sure what the mrket has priced in if anything...just thinking back to the huge run in Oil last year when Trump initially attacked Syria
1022 2018-04-10 22:08:47 have you tried Clinique Beyond perfecting foundation. It actually absorbs excess oil. Shiseido's oil blotting papers are great too.

1026 2018-04-10 22:08:30 Holy cow you're a horrible governor!

Didn't you suggest everyone say a prayer for the oil and gas industry?

Maybe you'll think about the children and the educators and say a prayer on their behalf
1027 2018-04-10 22:08:24 “Someone” used my olive oil and left literally ONE fucking drip in it and put it back in the cabinet

1032 2018-04-10 22:07:55 Is this where you repeat your false claims from the Movie Gasland saying the oil & gas industry & its emissions and effluents are exempt from the Federal Clean Air Act & Clean Water Act?   If Senator Muskie were alive today, he would say such claims are lying & fear mongering.
1033 2018-04-10 22:07:49 What has that got to do with Iceland removing palm oil from all own label products? You were wrong to jump on that tweet.

Tweet the PM if you have a complaint, or better still, stand as a labour candidate and do something about it.

1034 2018-04-10 22:07:40 The US of course. Connection from Med to Iraq and then Iran needed with sights on Afghanistan for a corridor to the Med from there to Pakistan and points north. Oil. They are still at this. Watch for a Syrian invasion. Helps Israel too.
1035 2018-04-10 22:07:39 Once upon a time, people could have relied on their federal government to define "national interest" as protecting the Pacific coast from an unnecessary risk of a catastrophic oil spill. Sigh. #cdnpoli #bcpoli
1036 2018-04-10 22:07:32 So wait.... regulations axed... US Oil production at all time high....but the price is up over last year when oil companies made their largest profits.  Seems r @GOP is not good at this economy thing!!!
1037 2018-04-10 22:07:31 This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana meet its power and energy needs.
1038 2018-04-10 22:07:27 #ImMrMeseeks #LookAtMe I read the price, $2.74 is far from the most expensive I've paid.

Meanwhile, you support the party of gas taxes and deliberate attacks on the oil industry
1039 2018-04-10 22:07:26 Oh gosh I just felt like I was dismissing your advice and I ddin't mean to sound rude.

It just so happens that when we cook and get splashed with hot oil, we would put cool oil to help out the burn. I should have asked first.
1040 2018-04-10 22:07:21 Who'd have known Willy Wonka had his own line of cars that run on chocolate syrup.  Although 6 quarts of melted chocolate bars costs a lot more than standard motor oil. it's TOTALLY worth it.  Now I know why mechanics spend so much time under all those cars.
1041 2018-04-10 22:07:12 What is with all these health issues now? Coffee is poisonous for you, Canola Oil is bad for you, Processed meat has carcinogens, Fluoride can cause cancer. And Bottled water and Sea Salt has Plastic in them. Good Grief.

1044 2018-04-10 22:07:00 The only food retailer actively avoiding palm oil is Iceland as announced today. In my opinion Waitrose is still one of the better choices.

1049 2018-04-10 22:06:34 Of course, the trump administration is out to make sure oil companies have record high profits.
1050 2018-04-10 22:06:31 In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[94]
1051 2018-04-10 22:06:30 .The GOP is a ship lost at sea, floating aimlessly, no sails, no mast, no leaders in cast, only snake oil salesman and traitors. Freedom, justice & equality, now die, in their throats. Their futures  have become one of “career suicide/salvage. Patriotism lies in a distant past.
1052 2018-04-10 22:06:25 Of course they do ! Theyveant yo carve up the Middle East and take control of its oil .,If there were no resources there to benefit the west they woudnt go near. It’s been planned for years. Just unthinkable madness

1059 2018-04-10 22:05:54 Islamists terrorize the world but the EU demand capitulation of #Israel just because Muslims used to West prostituting for their oil & money; many ignore history of Jesus, a Jewish reformist, who practiced Judaism in Jerusalem the capital of the ancient Judea- hence the name Jew

1072 2018-04-10 22:04:40 I mean, you will find industries will tend to lean one way or the other, Oil industries lean right and their money goes to fund campaigns... But these "left leaning" social media platforms have been used to get a conservative to win... so...

1080 2018-04-10 22:04:04 Agreed, the one thing that is new is historically those commodities had to flow back thru dollars at some point, because I'll commodities were priced in USD.  CNY oil begins to change that
1081 2018-04-10 22:04:02 @pnpcbc - Why is it considered Eco-Extremism to factor climate change into the decision to expand oil sands production? #nokindermorgan
1082 2018-04-10 22:04:00 So why is it OK for the Natives in the North to be planning a pipeline and then shipping the oil down the coast but it is not OK for Trans Mountain. You are either in favour of pipelines or against them. You can’t pick / choose and keep catering to the loudmouths
1083 2018-04-10 22:03:56 Why didn't they bring good to Zimbabwe when Zimbabweans suffered at hand during the leadership of Mugabe regime?  The answer is simple, there was nothing to steal from Zimbabwe. If it was oil rich, it could be another story.

1108 2018-04-10 22:01:53 Venezuela is a result of mismanagement by the government I the US or Russia were involved it would be more overt. I think only external forces are Cuba but they are again securing oil
1109 2018-04-10 22:01:34 Is oil still our focus? Are we serious at all ?
1110 2018-04-10 22:01:17 Good heavens, woman, EVERYTHING he's doing adversely affects our health and safety AND he's destroying our national parks, too. His grifter henchman Zinke has sold off huge parcels of our national treasures so oil and gas interests can exploit them WITHOUT REGULATION. #DontheCon
1111 2018-04-10 22:01:16 The last time I checked BC was a part of this democratic country. Our voice & opinions matter, it’s where WE live. Framing it to be in the nations best interest that WE give up our views is outrageous. Saving AB & the counties oil sector is not our burden.
1112 2018-04-10 22:01:14 Rub palm oil on it..
1113 2018-04-10 22:01:12 The young otoya pushed @Azkiyiclaws onto the bed and removes the males clothes and then he grabs the new made massage oil 

"You will get a relaxing massage"
1114 2018-04-10 22:01:03 Truffle oil isn’t even made with real truffles! Real truffles are water-based (like mushrooms), so, you know, water and oil. Truffle oil is just a chemical approximation of the taste of truffles. Truffle oil is a lie.
1115 2018-04-10 22:01:03 Big oil
1116 2018-04-10 22:00:57 Where did you hear that? Trump told Russians in the Oval about classified info. There is NO indictment for Comey, dude. Plus the aforementioned six fired/repositioned people, also are witnesses to OoJ. You know who benefits the most if US Sanctions on oil production are lifted?
1117 2018-04-10 22:00:56 It’s tragic that anyone would want to continue pulling oil from the ground.
1118 2018-04-10 22:00:47 Condolences to the pep an his oil men #rip 
1119 2018-04-10 22:00:45 I have been posting this for 4 hours with the aim of finding actual "journalists" not read & repeat writers. Know that our government(s) are not the good guys. Mass murder & horrors you can't imagine they support for the love of oil money & power.
1120 2018-04-10 22:00:40 a fair point.  information security is a broader term.  i think i'm just super twitchy on cyber-as-snake-oil-buzzword, but can see why that's a useful subfield distinction.
1121 2018-04-10 22:00:38 More important than USA starting the second civil war and million more deaths by trying to overturn a secular Jihadi hating regime in Syria to weaken Iran and make oil lobby/ Israel happy, WP thinks Trump’s consensual sexual escapades are more important.
1122 2018-04-10 22:00:35 Nah I massaged a bit of the pressed argan oil 
It has this nutty smell 
1123 2018-04-10 22:00:34 Eni was founded and established by law in 1953[10][11] from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives. In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[12][13] ALL MAPS HELD

1126 2018-04-10 22:00:14 Iceland to be first UK supermarket to cut palm oil from own-brand products.
1127 2018-04-10 22:00:05 Ps 133:2: It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the

1129 2018-04-10 21:59:59 Big news! Goldman Sachs loves oil!!! Not fake news
1130 2018-04-10 21:59:44 I closed my comments on Bloomberg’s Future of Natural Gas panel by reminding the audience that oil and gas carry a particular and unique social benefit that alternatives will eventually need to meet... severance and ad valorem taxes.
1131 2018-04-10 21:59:41 Not a kindly cuddly grandpa as many would have us believe.
Oil by his trainset no to our pipelines. 
Bet he makes money on the difference between our $33.- and current market price. 
Political interference as well.
1132 2018-04-10 21:59:39 look at Oil today and factor that in .. energy drives everything  ..  wait and see aproach
1133 2018-04-10 21:59:31 We're Canadian, we don't introduce legislation or law to make old ships "safer", we build bigger better and safer oil barges.
1134 2018-04-10 21:59:06 In July 2017, the oil giant accepted responsibility for an oil spill affecting the Fylde coast of Blackpool in the United Kingdom.[8]
1135 2018-04-10 21:59:02 Oil.
1136 2018-04-10 21:58:55 Who selling oil spill tickets ?
1137 2018-04-10 21:58:49 IF THE OIL IS SO BAD,BITUMEN,WHY IS ANYONE EVEN REMOVING IT FROM THE GROUND????
1138 2018-04-10 21:58:47 In terms of share capitalisation (the market value of shares), Eni is ranked sixth in comparison with the principal companies operating in the same sector: Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Total, BP, ConocoPhillips, Statoil, Anadarko, Apache and Marathon Oil.[7]
1139 2018-04-10 21:58:32 Blah blah blah. Water > Oil #KeepCanadaSmart #StopKM #FightBigOil
1140 2018-04-10 21:58:21 your dad said it needs an oil change :/
1141 2018-04-10 21:58:21 Brent Oil Spot looks pretty good - the key Resistance is $71.285 - if breaks out that's very bullish and obviously positive for Oil Stocks.
1142 2018-04-10 21:58:18 I knew someone would freak out on you over this eventually. I just assumed it would be a vegan soccer mom from Oregon, not a 12 year old paper boy from Missouri.
1143 2018-04-10 21:58:15 Putting hella dry shampoo in my hair cause I put waay too much coconut oil on after straightening it & now it’s hella oily 
1144 2018-04-10 21:58:05 It is terrorism.

When, out of all people killed by drones, 90% of them are NOT the intended target, this is terrorist bombing. (Nevermind the fact that our "wars" are just taking oil by brute force...)
1145 2018-04-10 21:58:04 I have done my research. We do need oil and gas, but we have to push harder in the direction of transitioning away from fossil fuels. The rest of the world is going to outpace us and we'll be left with inferior quality crude that nobody will want to buy.
1146 2018-04-10 21:58:01 America has nothing good to do to other countries than stealing oil.
1147 2018-04-10 21:57:56 Oil field size, extraction costs, price at time of extraction etc- Nats don’t half talk bollocks about UK oil (Not Scotland oil). It’s history & matterless anyway- just a constant Nat whinge. It’s about $65 now, SNP prediction was it would be twice that level to support economy
1148 2018-04-10 21:57:43 I didn't use it with the powder or oil for whitening but I like it cuz it's natural, no fluoride & my mouth ain't all extra minty 27 hours later lol
1149 2018-04-10 21:57:40 I guess oil money can’t buy y’all to win and they weren’t offsides

1154 2018-04-10 21:56:57 im currently smoking chicken that has been rubbed down in a homemade rub and baking chunks of potato in a salt/pepper/dill/olive oil mixture. you now want something with chicken and potatoes LUL
1155 2018-04-10 21:56:51 Then tell your daddy to stop dismantling the EPA.  Tell your daddy kids need clean air and water. Tell your daddy to stop selling off our lands to big oil. Tell your daddy to try eating a vegetable every now and then as an example. Ketchup on his McD fries doesn’t count.
1156 2018-04-10 21:56:45 It's tge bald bit of chin exposed I don't like. Either trim & oil or commit yourself to a full on santa 
1157 2018-04-10 21:56:44 A belated thank-you! We will continue to advocate for energy diversification and focus on getting more people to the table in pursuit of real solutions. It's great to hear your perspective, especially as a fellow oil rig worker yourself.
1158 2018-04-10 21:56:42 Pipeline to Churchill. Sell to Europe. Build RCN base at same. Piss off putin, Trudeau, BC all in 1 swoop. patrol arctic. Green tax semi truck shipments from BC past MB (dirty diesel). Sell oil to BC only if no retaliation. Central CDN coalition!

1160 2018-04-10 21:56:31 Anybody know of UX agencies in Calgary? Big plus if they’ve worked in the Oil and Gas domain or have done a lot of Big Data projects.
1161 2018-04-10 21:56:26 If that was the case, refinery and oil field workers would have an exorbitant cancer rate and this is not the case.
1162 2018-04-10 21:56:23 Yes! Let's cut down more trees to save money on oil!
1163 2018-04-10 21:56:23 Only Qatar has the oil money to turn it around like crazy PSG..
1164 2018-04-10 21:56:09 It’s not as if he cares about olive oil/adulteration, it’s just another platform for an anti EU whinge, but it’s looking a bit like it’s backfired
As a result I’ve found out more about how EU works to protect consumers against fraud from our friends @great_oil

1168 2018-04-10 21:55:35 #pnpcbc - Can we increase production in the oil sands and still reach the carbon reduction targets we agreed to in Paris?
1169 2018-04-10 21:55:32 Both US & UK have made guilty verdicts with no proof and no apology w/ #SkripalCase & now #Syria . IMO US & UK just exposed themselves again that they are not reasonable and want an examination of the evidence, but rather just want blood & oil no matter the cost.

1171 2018-04-10 21:55:11 #DidYouKnow

Coconut oil is a gem at removing makeup? It takes off your makeup so smoothly and you’re dodging so many chemicals by using it. 

Plus, makeup remover is so expensive! Ain’t nobody got $$ for that.
1172 2018-04-10 21:55:10 This is the social media equivalent of a major oil spill...Exxon has a friend request....
1173 2018-04-10 21:54:58 oil?
1174 2018-04-10 21:54:52 I ruined my chocolate pudding by putting orange oil in it. Now I'm unhappy.

1179 2018-04-10 21:54:15 Nutella re Palm Oil? Like @MichaelT1979 's advert voiceovers idea too though.
1180 2018-04-10 21:54:08 Again. Under Harper, 2 new pipelines were approved/built: The non-XL version of Keystone, from Alta to Nebraska, approved in 2006/completed in 2010; & Alberta Clipper, to Wisconsin, approved in 2008/active in 2010. The changeover in Line 9 taking oil west/east was also approved.
1181 2018-04-10 21:54:04 We have to ensure OUR sea waters are safe in case of a spill. 

Water protecters are not qualified to do an oceanic based oil spill clean up; but they ought to be.
1182 2018-04-10 21:54:03 By the way, we are always looking for feedback. If you're an oil trader or otherwise interested in oil/natgas, please let us know what data/analytics you would like to see on our website. Thanks.
1183 2018-04-10 21:53:58 super racing  oil for my car 50€ used out round it up

1185 2018-04-10 21:53:54 Okay but why did the guy at Jiffy Lube tell me my car REQUIRES platinum oil or they can’t do it....cause I’m a girl & thinks I’m stupid  
1186 2018-04-10 21:53:52 minimalism is all about filtering--narrowing your aperture

detail is just a matter of broadening your scope

in that way, it's all more of the same in practice while being completely different in theory
1187 2018-04-10 21:53:51 The oil and gas business is till tough.
1188 2018-04-10 21:53:50 Its sad that they used their most important PPV of the year to build towards a special on the WWE netowork in a country that wont allow women to compete. Vince loves his oil money !
1189 2018-04-10 21:53:49 Come now, all of us were foolish at 13, maybe not that foolish but foolish, the world has a way of educating fools.
1190 2018-04-10 21:53:44 who needs that much oil what are you doing with it
1191 2018-04-10 21:53:41 It’s awful. I don’t go to Midland every time that I visit family but I do try to drive through & it’s just nuts. So many people have moved in for the oil jobs. The crime rate is through the roof and there are fatal car crashes daily. I’ll say “hello” for you when I visit in June.
1192 2018-04-10 21:53:32 It's the flea on the dogs tail.....wagging the dog that has a flea brain!.....that's all I got....it's crazy!  Thank you oil for letting me tweet that....
1193 2018-04-10 21:53:29 @PnPCBC KM has pulled back because it isnt viable economically. This has been the issue from the start, they are in a mess themselves. Oil,prices are low. A prof talked about this on CBC news today.
1194 2018-04-10 21:53:25 How is it that the so called best manager in the world /Genius. ..inherited Bayern and Oil Money City ...but cant win a CL without Messi
1195 2018-04-10 21:53:19 Perhaps if your leader had not spent the first 18 months of her mandate vilifying Oil and Gas it would have helped.  Not to mention her whole pre political career.
1196 2018-04-10 21:53:07 That's an excellent plan, forget about social media and the phone for the rest of the night if you can. Get some lavender oil on your pillow and a little guided sleep meditation, you're going to be all good. You did great today.

1203 2018-04-10 21:52:28 I will never buy anything but an Acura or a Honda.  Ask me how much I've spent on repairs of ANY kind in 20 years?  ZERO.  Change the oil, rotate the tires, service the brakes now and then and go for 300,000 miles, not even a chip on the paint.
1204 2018-04-10 21:52:23 s/se asian cuisine: oil!
1205 2018-04-10 21:51:56 Gas is going up $.06 by Thursday. Did the price of oil spike and I missed the news?
1206 2018-04-10 21:51:52 With no long term studies, ima have to disagree. Inhaling vaporized man made oil cannot be healthy, yes it doesn't invoke combustion based disease but it can and probably does invoke other diseases not yet known due to the infancy of vapng.
1207 2018-04-10 21:51:48 Billions of barrels of oil will be transported to the coast by Rail and truck through all of our communities. Rail    follows river valleys. Remember fuel truck spill in Goldstream park and Lac-Megantic rail disaster! Pipeline is safest. Sleep Well BC!
1208 2018-04-10 21:51:48 Thank your for your message. Actually, we do not have a strong opinion on oil at all. And that days of supply forecast is from EIA's STEO report.

1210 2018-04-10 21:51:47 Brosephiluses and vergefamiliosos! We going to Pandora. I agree with @DougPolkPoker, I bet that Verge is going to be the new currency unit for all oil trading worldwide!!!

1213 2018-04-10 21:51:28 He refutes natural rights because....? LOL
Silly lil guy thinks that government “grants” all rights, so we live and die by its pleasure, and enslavement is within its purview.
I mean, since no one has any rights, anything the government does is within its rights, right? 
1214 2018-04-10 21:51:20 Man City is just a team with arabian oil money and lacking actual skills. And Guardiola was only a good coach in Barça.
1215 2018-04-10 21:51:13 Maybe is complicated, but you are a simpleton if you think that Assad doesn't deserve to be bombed for what he have done, he even financed Alqaeda in Iraq during the transition just to kill young americans and was the greatest buyer of Isis oil+gas,he is the greatest menace in Me
1216 2018-04-10 21:51:04 It is ASSADS country not USA or the Wests! He has been enabled by you all, but you want the Oil 7 gas to be under West control. Assad is a B*stard..you lot are just as bad!
1217 2018-04-10 21:50:55 Stephen your argument is bullshit, it is the ‘elite’ who want     an oil economy to bankroll their wealth.
1218 2018-04-10 21:50:54 I agree but the west is trying to manipulate oil interests and the asad allies have the same goals, in fact watching newsnight now there is not a dissenting voice, very bad #BBCNewsnight
1219 2018-04-10 21:50:51 I want rl add too, Russia has fought America many times, and EVERY TIME they LOST: Alaska (Gave us Alaska practically for FREE with ALL that oil under it! What a screw up!) And the Cold War. We win every time
1220 2018-04-10 21:50:25 Living in Cyprus we can only watch this with horror. Ffs Us & Uk get out of here. Oil pipeline can't be that important.
1221 2018-04-10 21:50:15 .... Well in that case pick me up 2 dozen and a bottle of coconut oil.
1222 2018-04-10 21:50:13 Had some fried fish Saturday that was fried in peanut oil.. never using regular oil for fried foods again.
1223 2018-04-10 21:50:08 He's not the fun kind of scam artist, unfortunately.  More like a snake oil salesman.
1224 2018-04-10 21:50:07 Wow stuff isn’t finally called for Man City and you’re complaining? Welcome to our whole season and we beat y’all? Have fun winning the PL with oil money while we win CL mate ...
1225 2018-04-10 21:50:01 Yea ruin our coastal water for your dirty oil. Get that going for sure!!!

1228 2018-04-10 21:49:27 The biggest threat to America is primarily the Federal Reserve Bank which is controlled primarily by the Rothschild family, then the CIA, military contractors, and then the oil companies. The oils companies got us mixed up with a very corrupt regime in Saudi Arabia.
1229 2018-04-10 21:49:25 The bridge water Mobil not being able to sell gas is really fahkin up my whole life. Like my cars pretty much been on empty since the oil leak lol

1231 2018-04-10 21:49:17 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
1232 2018-04-10 21:49:15 It's not like the USA has been legislated to stop buying oil from the middle east either.

1235 2018-04-10 21:49:01 Pastured lard is high in oleic fatty acid. One of my friends tested the fatty acid content of his pigs, and they were 60% oleic fatty acid (about 10% PUFU's). Olive oil is 70% oleic FA...Not many olive trees in Okinawa.
1236 2018-04-10 21:49:01 I can't believe people who jump on board to build the pipeline. Why would we give more money to Trump's Texas oil company so they can take our raw resources?
Look into it a bit. They are not going to share their profits with you.

1240 2018-04-10 21:48:10 Islamists terrorize the world but EU & UK demand capitulation of #Israel just because Muslims used to West prostituting for their oil & money; many ignore history of Jesus, a Jewish reformist, who practiced Judaism in Jerusalem the capital of the ancient Judea- hence the name Jew
1241 2018-04-10 21:48:05 Use water based products, usually water will be the first ingredient. But the go to is the LOC method (leave in or water based moisturizer, oil, and some sort of cream/hair butter). You can do this every night or every other night or every morning to refresh your styles.
1242 2018-04-10 21:48:05 Hmmmm, pogba just outclassed the oil money scum
1243 2018-04-10 21:48:04 おこだよ
1244 2018-04-10 21:48:00 if Alberta has a problem with us limiting the flow of oil why is their most powerful response to restrict the flow of oil ?  Seems schizophrenic to me , but either way they still suffer Less product to be sold , layoffs at refineries .  is the air rotting their brains?
1245 2018-04-10 21:47:57 That's not an argument for oil. If anything, its evidence of our long standing stupidity to allow ourselves to become so reliant on a fossil fuel. There are renewable options out there that are cheaper and greener. #NoPipelines
1246 2018-04-10 21:47:57 Human rights for countries with oil and extremist groups that don't like geopolitical enemies
1247 2018-04-10 21:47:29 Today would be a good day to address the elephant in the room: A foreign corp wants to expand a pipeline in FN unceded territory & you & Trudeau protect the oil co rather than FN people. Time to talk about that, Ms. Notley.
1248 2018-04-10 21:47:23 oil spill apology really
1249 2018-04-10 21:47:17 man I hate the ones that just won't let up. maybe drink a lil bit of caffeine. ice pack. stretch out your neck and shoulders. I can send you a link to an IG post that's stretches for migraines! peppermint oil on your temples. eat a bit of chocolate.
1250 2018-04-10 21:47:13 おめでとうございますーー！！
1251 2018-04-10 21:47:01 You go to shell for a simple oil change and they tell you a million and one things that’s wrong with your car, like damn daddy
1252 2018-04-10 21:47:01 If everyone stopped eating processed food there would be no need for palm oil. Eat natural foods!
1253 2018-04-10 21:46:45 Je valide l’hydratant pour le corps de chez @TheBodyShopFR à base de “cannabis sativa seed oil” 
1254 2018-04-10 21:46:42 BC may have to face the fact they will one day be forced to buy Alberta oil.

1257 2018-04-10 21:46:21 Nothing better than waiting 2 fucking hours for an oil change
1258 2018-04-10 21:46:13 I talked about getting an oil change the other day and an ad popped up on my Facebook feed. Didn’t look anything up, didn’t text about it. Weird
1259 2018-04-10 21:46:08 Then Iran joined in to make sure ISIS didn’t win, Russia aided Assad to sell arms, train its troops and secure oil. Turkey have used it as an excuse to attack Kurds and America are there to aid Saudi’s interests and its own. It won’t be a world war it it’s going to get worse.
1260 2018-04-10 21:46:05 Pretty much. Zuck is selling them snake oil and they don’t know the difference
1261 2018-04-10 21:45:56 when life gives you lemons chickpeas garlic tahini salt and olive oil make hummus
1262 2018-04-10 21:45:55 The problem with that idea it lack supplies, we know we can’t live off plant-based or nonrenewable source for fuel or  heating. The oil sector create Jobs,prospect,reduce taxes, income but Canadian oil sector has the best environmental standard in the world.
1263 2018-04-10 21:45:49 Peppermint oil!
1264 2018-04-10 21:45:26 A water based sealer is going to last 7 years? On a roadway? What snake oil salesman told any city engineer that. So much corruption #DrainTheSwamp

1269 2018-04-10 21:44:45 My friend is using hemp oil for chronic pain. Is this a thing? Does it work? Does it smell awful? 
#desperate #oldage #injured
1270 2018-04-10 21:44:37 My brother spent 3000.00 on shop tools.  My uncle in law enforcement has to come in on his day of to have the oil changed in his patrol car.
1271 2018-04-10 21:44:35 What does @CoryBooker use on his scalp? It's so shiny? Coconut oil maybe? Is it scented? These are the answers the American people need. #Zuckerbergtestimony
1272 2018-04-10 21:44:35 Energy is complicated. Most of the places where oil is drilled are red, but refineries are concentrated around Houston, which is team blue. The actual refinery owners are probably red. Not sure how this plays out.
1273 2018-04-10 21:44:33 So you are ready willing and able to die for big oil, and Wall Street bankers as they laugh at you?
1274 2018-04-10 21:44:16 Hang in there. I was force tapered off fentanyl and morphine for 14 months of hell. I used cannabis oil as my PM’s plan to switch to med cannabis. It’s been 4 mos after 22 yrs. my brain is very confused.
1275 2018-04-10 21:44:14 IF THEY EVER TAKE THIS TO CANADA I WILL DIE
1276 2018-04-10 21:44:12 BUT...Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? WOW.
1277 2018-04-10 21:43:50 How do people eat bread and oil, the fuck

1283 2018-04-10 21:43:31 It seems they want Alberta to do the heavy lifting by imposing a reduction in oil exports and then they will swoop in and be the hero that saves the day.
1284 2018-04-10 21:43:29 That is so scary let me go buy you some oil
1285 2018-04-10 21:43:26 Please go and educate yourself Rd why North Sea UK oil & Norwegian oil is RADICALLY different- good reasons I assure you, but I’m sick of pointing them out to uninformed Nats (Clue, size, timing, price, cost).
1286 2018-04-10 21:43:13 Saw you on @pnpcbc very sad that you won't say a pipeline is a pipeline.  Oil or lng is the same. You want to allow the @bcndp to have its lng but not TM pipeline. You looked foolish.
1287 2018-04-10 21:43:06 As long as there is barriers to exporting oil, a late start to spring preventing farmers from seeding , our provincial income will be subject to change.
1288 2018-04-10 21:43:03 #Andrewweaver the oil's still coming into BC along your rivers and streams via Rail?
1289 2018-04-10 21:43:00 It's beyond oil now. Some people are trying to get lands in places close to water for their tribesmen. It's no longer just some people trying to steal oil revenue in Abuja.
1290 2018-04-10 21:42:49 this has always pissed me off about AB - big oil has never been held accountable for clean up, yet gets all the tax breaks. Like if they left we would die without them. Who knew Canada has the capability of geothermal energy???? it is. pfft
1291 2018-04-10 21:42:47 this is about Iceland trying to remove palm oil and plastic  and the Tories are trying to tackle this issue (plastic). You should be applauding. Stop overlaying stuff about green energy & shit that is nothing to do with this topic.
1292 2018-04-10 21:42:46 I’ve been disappointed to discover some of my favourite skincare and cosmetics brands are not able to evidence they use sustainable palm oil and when asked a direct question so as a consumer I and others can make an informed decision the question is not responded to
1293 2018-04-10 21:42:38 Pep Guardiola is an Alan Pardew with Oil Money
1294 2018-04-10 21:42:38 i got the shimmering body oil from @KrazyEssentials! customizable scent and shimmer, and 1/4 of the price with my discount code nia. 
1295 2018-04-10 21:42:26 We shouldn’t be in the sand, you’re so big in the truth then tweet about how much our blood has been spilled for OIL, opps sorry, profits.
1296 2018-04-10 21:42:26 Since the end of WW1 it’s been about capturing OIL! A fight over pipelinistan if you will, at present. Along with reserves in Golan Heights! Water capture figures in locally.
Also and most importantly!
A challenge to Bretton Woods!

Currency War! 
Human rights? Poppycock!
1297 2018-04-10 21:42:25 'Iceland removes palm oil from their own products.' Best news EVER! Say no to palm oil and save the rain forest!
1298 2018-04-10 21:42:25 Remember that from an environment perspective butter and lard (animal products in general) have a larger foot print than palm oil. Stick to plant based oils, just not palm.
1299 2018-04-10 21:42:23 Well, I WAS going to get an oil change, but a police helicopter just flew over saying something about surrendering 
1300 2018-04-10 21:42:16 Ok firstly oil and massages don’t happen when you get a haircut lol they spray your head at most! They have long hair it has to be by a hair stylist though
1301 2018-04-10 21:42:01 Humans mind it Humans r dying in #Syria but whole world is involved in doing #Oil #Politics Mind it #Oilpolitics. Ishwar make me super ruler for 30 days, your promise Humanity will be made as only religion. Rest will rest in peace #Rip
1302 2018-04-10 21:42:00 And of course, that would be on top of socializing the cleanup costs of abandoned oil and gas wells in AB.
1303 2018-04-10 21:41:49 This is a basement dweller!
1304 2018-04-10 21:41:48 If one group has a 240 year head start then it's impossible to catch up unless they collapse or the group playing catch up finds a resource that's as valuable as oil and maintains total ownership of it.
1305 2018-04-10 21:41:28 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1306 2018-04-10 21:41:27 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1307 2018-04-10 21:41:13 Shutting down the oil sand will cost more then existing debt.

@chanellemorray_
1309 2018-04-10 21:40:53 Do you have a habit of touching your face or resting it on your hands? Might also be over cleansing, taking away too much of your skin's oil, or irritating it from scrubbing etc. But I feel ya, I'm oooold and still dealing with acne.
1310 2018-04-10 21:40:50 We try our best to avoid products with palm oil and it's fantastic that @IcelandFoods is removing it from it's products. Other stores should follow suit.
1311 2018-04-10 21:40:43 Very disappointed in you Mr. Trudeau.  Where is your vision for a green and prosperous Canada?  Its 2018 - the world needs to move away from oil.
1312 2018-04-10 21:40:43 I hope u dumb hoes know that leaving coconut oil in your hair will potentially burn it
1313 2018-04-10 21:40:41 I agree it's a good start, but with 800 stores it would be a stronger stance to announce they won't stock ANY products that use PALM OIL within the same time frame.
1314 2018-04-10 21:40:39 Scotland is the only country in the UK which exports more than it imports.
Scotland has the following % of UK production...
96% oil
62% seafood
60% gas
40% wind, marine and solar energy.

"Scotland has a higher GDP than 6 other EU countries combined."
-That last bit quite a stat

1319 2018-04-10 21:40:18 This is bad news for your corporate oil bought party that you can't find another industry  (hello solar panels) to 'nation build'. Your dirty  tar sands in Alb really did some awesome 'nation building' eh? Canada was a great nation before and will be great without KM #cdnpoli

1324 2018-04-10 21:40:02 Ooh, I see. Hope you brought great amounts of oil and gas, then. XD

1326 2018-04-10 21:39:46 Switching to an @Origins oil free face wash got me feeling like a lil poreless fairy and I am defo not mad about it 
1327 2018-04-10 21:39:38 It’s only “Canada’s oil” when they want to “get the product to market”.
BC gets a few jobs, Alberta gets tinier royalties each year, oil companies get almost all of the profits. We’re it Canada’s oil, we might get a small profit share - yeah yeah jobs -  but few direct $ from oil
1328 2018-04-10 21:39:36 @GaryLineker talking about @ManCity being a new money club, em...did they not buy Robinho in 2008 for around £30 million? 10 years with oil tycoon money isnt new money club.
1329 2018-04-10 21:39:33 The oil companies stole Korean Air Lines Flight 007.
1330 2018-04-10 21:39:29 You are talking as if the major resource, oil, will be with us forever. Best to prepare for the long game. In the long run, the people with the right human capital will win.
1331 2018-04-10 21:39:27 Oil money no work today. D unstopable Messi was stopped today! I love FOOTBALL O!!!
1332 2018-04-10 21:39:27 I love the smell of baby oil

1337 2018-04-10 21:39:02 just a reminder that it’s not an oil pipeline, it’s a diluted bitumen pipeline
there is a difference

1338 2018-04-10 21:38:46 John, as always the truth will never be really known but the similarities between Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Syria are there for all to see. The West seem to be incapable and unwilling to learn from history. The common denominator is oil/gas and it’s the poor people that are dying.

1340 2018-04-10 21:38:35 You should bow down to Lukaku, he the reason you won that match. Your so called greatest club of all time was built to win a quadruple, right? Yes you got the league & an irrelevant cup but that oil money was made for greater things. You cheer on a neglected stepchild club
1341 2018-04-10 21:38:27 The incompetent Westminster govt gave the oil companies so many tax cuts during the downturn that we were almost paying them to take our oil yet they still laid off 1000s of workers.
1342 2018-04-10 21:38:22 Oil is the future of Canada. RT if you agree..
1343 2018-04-10 21:38:20 Greg you are missing the big picture. Weaker dollar don't waste time watching the small gold and silver markets, why don't you mention what is going on the oil prices rocketing higher which is a much bigger market.
1344 2018-04-10 21:38:16 He acts like the players went and pumped oil. Smh
1345 2018-04-10 21:38:08 Right as I get to this Valvoline station every car needs an oil change lmao
1346 2018-04-10 21:38:06 Yeah, in a deal that allowed them to sell their oil to the west. lol

You're not so bright are you. lol

1348 2018-04-10 21:38:00 Foxy chews the bags, but she’s never managed to chew anything off the bags. I researched why cats eat plastic and it’s something to do with them being made with corn oil.
1349 2018-04-10 21:37:57 It’s a screenshot of oil tankers, your doubting that tankers currently are moving all around the world shipping oil?

1364 2018-04-10 21:36:12 Could somebody tell them there isn't any oil in the North Sea! Scottish people were told in 2014 during #indyref And will be told again for #indyref2
1365 2018-04-10 21:36:05 It's happening again now. Practically any amount of face oil makes it happen. That's just crazy.

1372 2018-04-10 21:35:32 That moment when you get a discount on your oil change after talking to the service guy about his daughter becoming a pot pharmacist.
1373 2018-04-10 21:35:30 Don't be too in haste to conclude buddy. Wait to see what happens next season. Hopefully Pep won't finish the oil money next season 
1374 2018-04-10 21:35:29 I’m not asking myself what’s in it for Iceland? I’m looking at the positives for Borneo and other areas, can’t you see that? I do not care why they have made the move, but I praise it and what I do care about is Borneo and other ecosystems being destroyed by palm oil plants.
1375 2018-04-10 21:35:12 Yes, you should be outraged as I am also. But, you should be even more outraged at the current occupation of Army forces illegally in Syria guarding Syrian Oil fields. U.S Soldiers illegally in Syria? They are promoting the unforgivable War that keeps Syrians leaving& Murdered.
1376 2018-04-10 21:35:09 They do in all the village, if you want gas you have to have an oil drum in your garden, the oil man comes every couple of weeks. We don`t have oil, Only elecy,
1377 2018-04-10 21:35:06 Like PSG here in France and all these oil builded teams
1378 2018-04-10 21:34:59 And, the wheel turns. Wonder whose holding the oil can?
1379 2018-04-10 21:34:55 What about the oil! Build another line and designate it for just oil!
1380 2018-04-10 21:34:53 Bill. Its not worth punishing B.C. and rolling over for oil industry. You'll never win pipeline proponents over, no matter what you do.
1381 2018-04-10 21:34:53 Come on people. Does anyone think Trudeau made a slip of the tongue when he said “we will phase out the oil sands”. NO!! That is his and his ultra leftist agenda working to a T.
1382 2018-04-10 21:34:46 Did you see the video of the Nigerians who protested in London today? Nigerians at home don’t have energy again. When this oil money is over, it’s either the diaspora steps in or we enter the road to Somalia.

Herdsmen crisis is just the harbinger of what to expect.
1383 2018-04-10 21:34:31 You need to emphasize that you need to check oil periodically. People will run engines out of oil with these extended change intervals.
1384 2018-04-10 21:34:28 “So she read online or on one of her mom Facebook pages that you grease the pole with olive oil and the squirrels can’t climb the bird feeder. So she put EVOO on a rag and when I got home I see her out there jacking off the bird feeder post.” #WorkConversations #WorkConvos

1386 2018-04-10 21:34:21 @ceo_fssai why is Palm Oil not banned in India, even though it has been proved that it is carcinogenic
@narendramodi, @MOFPI_GOI
1387 2018-04-10 21:34:20 went to get my oil changed today, found out there was a nest in my air filter so i planned on spending $45 total and left spending $125

I wonder, water, or oil?
Either way he's well hydrated and wow, what a bladder!

1392 2018-04-10 21:34:04 They all agree to go and attack #Syria so oil in Golan heights can be obtained  there’s the motive
1393 2018-04-10 21:34:02 Things to try
Apply with a clean spoolie at night
- Castor oil
- Vitamin E oil
- Aloe Vera 
- Cedar wood oil
- Vaseline
- Olive oil
- Coconut oil
You could also invest in a store bought eyelash lengthener
1394 2018-04-10 21:33:53 When in doubt, nationalize the oil industry.
It always results in success
1395 2018-04-10 21:33:46 Westminster is where ONE Parliament is and where SOME decisions are made. 96% of oil production comes from Scotland. You really need to check your facts.
1396 2018-04-10 21:33:27 He’s retarded, man shitty tried to buy Messi like 102 times, all they can do is spend oil money nothing more
1397 2018-04-10 21:33:26 IM SO IRRITATED IM GETTING MY OIL CHANGED AND THEYRE TAKING FOREVER ITS BEEN SITTING THE SHOP FOR AN HOUR ALMOST TWO I HATE YOU
1398 2018-04-10 21:33:25 I give up with eating, just knocked the frying pan off the hob and onto the the floor, sausages and oil flying everywhere, awesome.

1400 2018-04-10 21:32:41 XML lived up to its hype before JSON came into picture.  Wrong to compare XML and blockchain.  With the need for decentralisation and also the urgent need to protect the new oil - data.  Blockchain is the right start
1401 2018-04-10 21:32:39 I’m in desperate need of a hot oil treatment. 

*calls my mom*
1402 2018-04-10 21:32:38 I rather wash lo. Cooking is so much pressure and effort to prepare. Oil splashing, heat, chances of ruining the dish and kena complain 
1403 2018-04-10 21:32:32 The media will portray him as a power mad tyrant now, just like they did with Saddam. The only way to rule in the M.E is with an Iron fist and our govt know it or they’d go after Erdogan and Saudi too. Assad is standing in the way of an oil pipeline.
1404 2018-04-10 21:32:24 She should probably be pointing to Riyadh. The Saudis are in trouble if the price of oil stays low. Their entire economy depends on it. And what happens if there is a Mid East conflagration? 
1405 2018-04-10 21:32:21 The perfect essential oil display and the perfect carrier for that display.  Sometimes things just work.

Oil and gaz discovered in Sénégal Will with the mining industries destroy the environnement with négative impact on our living conditions. In my City of Ngaye Meckhé we are experiencing négative effects  from the GCO zircon mining. What tomorrow Will be for us?

1433 2018-04-10 21:28:58 That's just nonsense, he's a very successful CEO...  Oil companies have CEO's too...  You don't think they'd like to ban all liberals?
1434 2018-04-10 21:28:48 I'd bet good money that if oil was found in Yemen, it would probably incite "a chemical attack" on Saudi Arabia, followed by a "regime change" call from Trump et al..

1439 2018-04-10 21:27:59 Your sarcasm is abhorrent. No, I’m for the oil sands! I’m for Canada’s prosperity! I’m for Renewable energy (when technology catches up to reality) I am not however into divisive rhetoric and those that stand on a pedestal only to avoid the mud that surrounds them.
1440 2018-04-10 21:27:36 The only downside to being an oil head is when wax gets stuck to your clothes.... 
1441 2018-04-10 21:27:25 Open up more commodity futures externally in shfe now oil has paved the way. Make those contracts fully convertible.
1442 2018-04-10 21:27:11 @theJagmeetSingh @CanadianGreens I've tweeted that corp's should take responsibility of paying $$ towards health problems + oil spills, corps should never hv more rights than ppl - govt keeps forwarding corp agendas + using public tax $$ supporting corps- we need change f. sure

1444 2018-04-10 21:27:04 And again, the only drawbacks to any of this (oil, gas, "clean coal") that is referenced is that supplies are finite and Arabs have lots. Nuclear was promoted: guess what Exxon was in the business of?

1446 2018-04-10 21:27:02 Of course, there are perfectly sustainable sources of palm oil anyway .... So it's all very strange virtue-signalling.
1447 2018-04-10 21:26:59 People working on pipelines and pumping oil through them is good for the economy too!
1448 2018-04-10 21:26:57 So I ran into a brand new (to me) conspiracy theory today. Apparently some tinfoilers believe that oil is not a fossil fuel, that it just bubbles up out of the crust.  That it's constantly replenished from some mystery source in the mantle. 
1449 2018-04-10 21:26:36 They called it tanning oil in them days! Before cancer....#MAGA

Why is their environment worth less that BC. Talk about arrogance and entitlement. Says Trudope throwing B.C. under the bus, BC throwing the rest of us to the wolves.
1452 2018-04-10 21:26:18 Attack will be on everything Syrian. 
For the land, 
for the Israel, 
for the oil/gas pipelines from middleeast & iraq directly to Mediterranean sea. 
for the water.
1453 2018-04-10 21:26:17 The Americans and Israelis will do anything to get the oil from the golan heights.
1454 2018-04-10 21:26:15 Oh don’t get me wrong, it’s inline with Oil tradition, but ol’ Pete specifically asked for POHO because of his Bruin experience. Money might talk, but this was already contemplated when he was hired and I wouldn’t assume it would be as easy as you say.
1455 2018-04-10 21:26:12 In oil is good as it is fat soluble. Or get Nature's Plus.
1456 2018-04-10 21:26:10 Well done! Why did you choose this strategy as opposed to replacing it with sustainable palm oil as other supermarkets have? (No criticism, curious)
1457 2018-04-10 21:25:57 Assuming your un-titled, un-labelled map of half of the northern hemisphere is depicting oil tankers, I would venture that the protesters protesting oil tankers are choosing the coast with the fewest tankers, proposed site of a tanker terminal, because they are against tankers.
1458 2018-04-10 21:25:56 Ugh.. how about we buy something useful like an oil company so we can actually make some money of our resources?
1459 2018-04-10 21:25:43 “Ahhh, I feel so clean! All that oil gone~...”
1460 2018-04-10 21:25:24 I don't think the germs are the problem so much as the oil tracked in from the road.
1461 2018-04-10 21:25:17 The show to keep eyes away from #Syria as genie oil wants golan heights (now or never) for black gold and Israel wants control of water rights . This another #WMD campaign to bring wealth to #UniParty with the blood of #US
1462 2018-04-10 21:25:11 You have to think about the long game: it's all a plan to make the world population so disgusted by the use of oil that we quit cold turkey and start using the renewables that we're not investing in because pipelines create jobs, or something.
1463 2018-04-10 21:25:07 True, BUT Pruitt is now becoming more aware of all the factors & details exposing the damage done by the vast production & promotion of oil, which is losing ground from the standpoint of future demand. Thereby Mr. Pruitt might be changing his position on a lot of things.
1464 2018-04-10 21:25:05 not if your exporting oil from Alberta...

.
1471 2018-04-10 21:24:23 Nobody you know. I can’t remember knowing a single City fan outside of Manchester before the Saudi oil money came in.
1472 2018-04-10 21:24:15 The best way Notley ‘s NDP to help is put the screws to BC Oil and gas supplies then get out of the way of business.
1473 2018-04-10 21:24:09 Some terrible decisions went against City over both legs, but no doubt Liverpool deserved to progress.

In one way I'm glad oil money has failed, but both Liverpool & Roma qualifying makes us look abject failures
1474 2018-04-10 21:24:05 I know what's hurtful!  See @JimCarrey art? Depicting a farm.  my Aunt in Huxley Iowa.  It's hurtful my aunt lost her land to rich oil men. Eh?

1481 2018-04-10 21:23:21 At all costs keep government out of owning and running the oil and gas industry. Their job is to create and enforce the laws that allow our country and Canadians citizens to thrive while working in our natural resources industries. We don’t need another Venezuela in this country

1503 2018-04-10 21:21:42 Well,  people use their insurance for basic services.  That doesn’t help. That’s like filing an automotive insurance claim to change your oil.  Insurance is for catastrophic loss, not oil changes and check-ups.  There’s a million reasons why it sucks, and govt is the root.
1504 2018-04-10 21:21:20 @VassyKapelos  And you can't fight climate change by shipping out more dirty oil. That's a blatant lie.   Where are the green iinitiatives we expected from this government.
1505 2018-04-10 21:21:20 Is it Not America’s allies (EU) buying the oil?Didn’t the same thing happen in Libya.Gaddafi decides to unify Africa against Obama’s wish. Did they not take Gaddafi out and blamed it on “illiterate Libyans.”Was Libya not the only African country without debt?
1506 2018-04-10 21:21:20 Ronda (my car) got new tires and an oil change and it feels so good

1514 2018-04-10 21:20:49 Qatar wanted a pipeline thru Syria to Med sea, Assad said no. Meanwhile Russia is capable of flooding European markets with their own oil (lots) thru Syria. Sauds are pissed. And the chem attack- cui prodest?

1516 2018-04-10 21:20:36 I wish @TraderJoesRants ban palm oil.
1517 2018-04-10 21:20:27 Perhaps Waitrose moves today might reassure the firm? Agree our interviewee from palm oil industry argued some good points

1520 2018-04-10 21:20:09 Let's start a petition for the makers of earth balance butter to stop using palm oil.
1521 2018-04-10 21:20:01 Same I was like might as well do something productive so now I'm eating McDonald's and watching Netflix after changing the oil in the truck.
1522 2018-04-10 21:19:56 @avanover1991 it was a .02 stock that rose to .11 then reverse split to 2.21 and dropped to where it is today.  Needs to strike Oil to go up
1523 2018-04-10 21:19:53 @IcelandFoods here in the UK have announced today that they will no longer use palm oil in any of their own products, if the larger supermarkets were to follow, specially global ones, that would be a step in the right direction, towards saving Orangutans habitat. Signed.
1524 2018-04-10 21:19:52 My head is on 10! How do I loosen braids? Should I spritz water on them? Or oil? Idk what to do! Halp! 
1525 2018-04-10 21:19:46 Good on Iceland, banning palm oil in their own brands..
1526 2018-04-10 21:19:41 Supermarket chain Iceland are to be congratulated on their decision to remove palm oil from their products. Keep making a positive impact on our planet!
1527 2018-04-10 21:19:39 Guess I’ll use some olive oil out the kitchen then
1528 2018-04-10 21:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

1531 2018-04-10 21:19:17 All you have is belligerence and juvenile conspiracies. So let's return to the facts when you are ready.
-record oil production
-four new pipelines last 10 years
-two more under construction 
-exports/imports improved
1532 2018-04-10 21:19:05 Then how did ISIS form. Is it not the Obama admin that hired Marcenaries to overthrow Assad, then they took over Syrian oil rigs. And don’t we know why Obama sanctioned Russia, so the oil trade in Russia declined. Don’t we know who buys the ISIS oil? Is...
1533 2018-04-10 21:19:00 Sorry I’m not wise in these things. Does the coconut oil tempt the sun to shine in which case I may smear myself in it so the sun follows me

1535 2018-04-10 21:18:52 I never said I was a pipeline expert. I stated a fact. The Keystone Pipeline burst over South Dakota. The oil is shit oil and goes straight to China. I have never seen an oil pipeline. Why the fuck does that matter? What does that have to do with anything?
1536 2018-04-10 21:18:52 BRILLIANT NEWS -  following their commitment to cut plastics, the food store Iceland is banning palm oil in their own brand products.  
Thank you Iceland, let's hope more follow.
1537 2018-04-10 21:18:27 @VassyKapelos My family came to Alberta in the 1880s and 90s.  I watched the govt give away all the wealth to oil companies and now they want to make up for that by destroying the beautiful BC coast. That stuff can't be cleaned up.
1538 2018-04-10 21:18:23 et non ! bigflo et oil ( lol pas oli !!!!)
1539 2018-04-10 21:18:12 @IcelandFoods ditching palm oil is a massive step, thank you for thinking about the future!

1543 2018-04-10 21:17:51 Smbody came to power when a barrel of oil was over $140 in the international market, and depleted our foreign reserve frm $62m to $26m

And another came, when the same oil was $32 and was able to grow the foreign reserve from $26m to  $47.3m

you are still asking, what did he do?

1551 2018-04-10 21:17:00 Our petrodollar requires more oil to bolster its value. It needs Syria’s oil, Iran’s, Venezuela’s, and it looks like Mexico’s.

1557 2018-04-10 21:16:25 problem is coconut oil burns easily

1565 2018-04-10 21:15:38 I gotta get a oil change too  I’m close to the date on my sticker
1566 2018-04-10 21:15:31 We pay 20% income tax, Norway 28%. If you are going to be campaigning for more progressive and fair tax rates here so we can 'bank' oil revenues for future use then I look forward to that plan rather than this moaning .......Also we pay nothing to visit a GP,  Norwegians pay £18.
1567 2018-04-10 21:15:30 @mavimisket Instead of planning a war with Syria, we should be planning a war with Israel and Saudi Arabia. They both have us over a barrel with their private central banks and oil. They are bigger threats to Americans than anyone else in the world.

1570 2018-04-10 21:15:21 except oil that is

standard debt sustainability math says trade deficit now a bit higher than sustainable (Ext debt will rise) if interest rates normalize v growth, and trade deficit rising again.

will need to adjust back to tradables, just a question of when.

1572 2018-04-10 21:15:15 Environment. Why agree to tax the public for things at every opportunity but not the producers. Why allow big oil to pollute tribal lands and natural habitats with leaky pipelines

1579 2018-04-10 21:14:22 more worried tho about traded v non-traded sector split -- most services still arely thinly traded (and the most easily traded services -- e.g ipr -- tend to be thinly taxed) rather than manufacturing/ services split per se.  US moving away from tradables (except oil) again ...

1581 2018-04-10 21:14:14 This currency thingy loses me. So they take the oil out of Scottish water, which at the moment is using Sterling, then they sell it in dollars? Am sure they convert my money at the airport into any currency? Changing currencies can work...amerangue?

1589 2018-04-10 21:13:33 ...different fats will have a different thermic effect and will therefore be broken down differently from each other. For example, medium chain triglycerides (such coconut oil) produce a significantly greater thermic effect than long chain triglycerides (such as vegetable oil)...
1590 2018-04-10 21:13:33  I just like the oil money excuse, not the shit management we have or the ancient board.

1592 2018-04-10 21:13:16 If the pipeline isn’t built it means more oil trains, which are far more dangerous and also more carbon intensive.
1593 2018-04-10 21:13:11 Of all the times 2 get my period right now isn’t it.

1596 2018-04-10 21:12:40 Good news but according to @RFUK palm oil guide you are falling way behind other supermarkets e.g. @waitrose and @Sainsbury’s - it’s confusing to know what to buy and from where, but well done for bringing attention to this issue. I just hope there’s more behind it than PR.
1597 2018-04-10 21:12:36 Smallholders are forced into clearing for palm oil as it is the main source of governmental subsidies, as a 'priority industry'. Stop the incentives, stop the clearing....
1598 2018-04-10 21:12:19 Are there others you'd rec? I have a bunch of vegan friends and I am sad to be like, please let me offer you...no butter (olive oil exists but still you know)
1599 2018-04-10 21:12:08 I think in reality even if the total oil recovery industry was shut down tomorrow, we would not meet our emissions targets.

1605 2018-04-10 21:11:19 if syria had iraqi oil we would have invaded right
1606 2018-04-10 21:11:15 Agree. Russia is going to try to take out Israel (who is probably responsible for the chemical attack) and then Saudi Arabia. They will control all of the Middle East oil as a result.

1608 2018-04-10 21:10:57 Top scorer on the bench when you have to go for it thick bastard. The arabs will stump up oil money again in summer they are dying to buy it
1609 2018-04-10 21:10:51 Yeah yeah oils a bonus, even the authors of the white paper admitted oil revenues were factored into how we would pay for public services so that arguments been discredited.

1624 2018-04-10 21:10:02 Trudeau wants to end the Canadian energy industry.  At the least oil/gas/pipeline part.  Haven’t you heard the future & lots of jobs are w wind & solar.  Trudeau is just doing what he was elected to do.  He’s shutting down as much of the oil & gas industry as fast as he can.
1625 2018-04-10 21:09:58 And the peasants came here & worked the founderies, factories, oil fields & mines for whatever the new FEUDAL lords(aka business magnates) promised provided they "caused no trouble"(didn't unionize) & maintained the status quo whenever possible(no allying with PoC whatsoever...)

1629 2018-04-10 21:09:37 Passion / best fans in the world vs Oil money / plastic flag/fans 5-1. Get the fuck in you reds!! ALLEZ ALLEZ ALLEZ!!! 
1630 2018-04-10 21:09:31 We see now the same piece of theater before the Occupation of Iraq in 2003: mainstream Zio-freemasonery media talking about mass destruction weapons, security council voting,lies lies lies.After 15 years,they stole their oil,their Gold,their historical heritage,their money,
1631 2018-04-10 21:09:25 Shame we used that MOAB we had.
Maybe Trump will threaten to invade and take their oil.
Maybe Trump will have his lawyer, not lawyer, give #Assad to stop using chemical weapons.
1632 2018-04-10 21:09:13 Its ok, congrats for PL. Try to sell some oil and spend billions next year, Give Pep 3 top players for each position in summer and shut down ur academy. He can won Oil city treble.

1638 2018-04-10 21:08:51 I do something similar with Diet Coke. When it foams up I just stick my finger in it for a sec to reduce the foam to keep pouring. Might be the salt or the oil on my finger. Weird I know.
1639 2018-04-10 21:08:44 idk how to explain it but it’s like water and oil.... it just doesn’t mix.
1640 2018-04-10 21:08:42 No democracy here to defend ..all our politicians, save a precious few, are bribed by the campaign finance contributions from the war, oil, banking interests. Ours here, now, is a plutocracy.
1641 2018-04-10 21:08:40 yes. myself. and I still think the dominant control of oil and our gas stations themselves shouldn't be coming from the middle East, or Asia. and I still use terms like "dot-head" or "arab" because that's what you are as much as I am a "soak chewing confederate flag wielding
1642 2018-04-10 21:08:36 I reckon they’ll strike oil off the coast of Worms Head mate. Then we’ll win everything!
1643 2018-04-10 21:08:29 They sacrifice their own troops in Vietnam and killed their own people for oil!
1644 2018-04-10 21:08:04 The L’Oreal Paris Extraordinary Oil Facial Night Cream might just be the best thing  I’ve ever spent money on 
1645 2018-04-10 21:08:02 Wild Growth hair oil is good. It takes a few weeks to see results though. Also Jamaican black castor oil makes hair grow like crazy but it sticks so use sparingly. It may take some time but when you’re diligent with your routine you’ll definitely see some growth.
1646 2018-04-10 21:07:59 What the heck our children, grandchildren & generations to come do not need clean H20, air, unpolluted ground from oil spills & fracking, & to hell with protected animals since they will have pictures to look at instead
1647 2018-04-10 21:07:57 My grandmother: that lady didn’t even know what she was talking about!!! I told her, I said, “my granddaughter Shelby - you just mention an essential oil and she knows all about it and how to use it!” This woman had to use a book! A book! 

My nanny - personal hype lady
1648 2018-04-10 21:07:55 Agree, canon boat at Finnish independent waters: 3 diesel engines+ONE gasturbin=35,000 hp (cold weather more) 6,000 litres oil an hour.And  me drinking water then after then Chevash Regal.Bye.

1651 2018-04-10 21:07:47 I just cleared a bottle of truffle oil out of my pantry that expired in 2011. Oh, what a life I thought I would lead.

1654 2018-04-10 21:07:37 Early in 1937, the school board canceled their natural gas contract and had plumbers install a tap into Parade Gasoline Company's residue gas line to save money. This practice—while not explicitly authorized by local oil companies—was widespread in the area.

1656 2018-04-10 21:07:28 How much oil did you use today?
1657 2018-04-10 21:07:27 There isn't much happening because our governments aren't putting in the resources for the transition.  $3.2 Billion still goes to the oil industry as a subsidy.  Imaging what that money could do in the carbon free energy sector?
1658 2018-04-10 21:07:23 "chelski" we call them  , similarly Man City is funded by Middle Eastern oil money
1659 2018-04-10 21:07:12 Finessed my way into a free oil change, 2 coupons for free appetizers at Texas Roadhouse, and an $8 off coupon for my next oil change
1660 2018-04-10 21:07:08 It’s bitter sweet seeing the scouters go through, obviously it’s the scousers and I want nothing but shit for that club but it means that football stays pure for another year and shows oil money hasn’t won yet.
1661 2018-04-10 21:06:58 I was the opposite- end of the day meant I had managed another day buttt now I’ve therapied a lot of my depression I have more time for the evening anxieties...  yay? Such a cliché I know  but I’m quite into evening lavender oil

1672 2018-04-10 21:05:39 #pnpcbc I don't blame Kinder Morgan for getting tough. The Liberals have spent far too long on words and far too little on real actions. Now time has caught up with them and they have to get off the pot. Not that I like heavy Oil recovery much.
1673 2018-04-10 21:05:34 We don't want war with Russia. We just want to leave Syria. These old bitter men are obsessed with oil and we're sick of it
1674 2018-04-10 21:05:24 Probably A. The zip code in his username is in the heart of oil country in Utah. Also, it’s very rural out there and getting good teachers in a state that hardly pays them may be an issue too.
1675 2018-04-10 21:05:14 he probably will be replaced for the cutout he is.  look at his recently resigned COO Sandberg, she was his SES handler.  he's expendable.
something will morph, but nothing will really change. data is the new oil.
1676 2018-04-10 21:05:12 The way I would personally do poisons is similar to the blade oil concept:

You have two types of poisons, one damaging, one debilitating. The damaging one affects all your attacks, and does type-less damage.
1677 2018-04-10 21:05:09 Retweeted Andrew (@andrewfootie):

Young folks working at top-tier Banks and oil companies are processing skilled immigrant applications everyday. This is a problem and we might not see the effects till about 2 decades

1680 2018-04-10 21:05:05 i hate liverpool but i bloody respect them because of their roots. but i cannot stand city theyre such a shit club built in slavery and oil money bunch of frauds plastic twats
1681 2018-04-10 21:05:00 We have been fighting a proxy war with Russia in Syria for 3 years now.  Not because of oil, but because Russia and Iran want a Med sea port.  That does not excuse use of chemical weapons
1682 2018-04-10 21:04:54 He "believed" he had the power to:
*Ban Muslims - He didn't 
*Ban transgender in mil- He didn't 
*limit scope of investigation - nope
*sell federal land to oil buddies to drill - also nope
*arrest journalists covering protests-nope
*send DOJ after his "enemies"- no again
1683 2018-04-10 21:04:47 Recuperó $BVSP, saltó el $OIL, se tranquilizó $SPX y acá dejó como saldo una buena rueda. De la mano de petroleras y siderúrgicas, $Merval avanzó 1,16%.

1686 2018-04-10 21:04:37 Yer I know but their own label items will still have to be re stocked with no palm oil and they do sell their brand that are a substitute for the branded items so their shelves will be under stocked with variety,anyway it’s a cop out they’ll still sell the palm oil branded goods

1689 2018-04-10 21:04:22 I truly love the people arguing about what a great idea this is. No one mentions how long before it’s black from tires, oil, soot, etc, and how about an environmental impact study on what happens when it wears off...
1690 2018-04-10 21:04:18 @AWCanada Love the fact that you promote the natural food offerings you have, but it's past time to do something about those fries. Potatoes, oil, salt. #allyouneed #changeforthebetter

1693 2018-04-10 21:04:02 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.
1694 2018-04-10 21:03:56 Have you never heard of a bank, you know the ones who lend. Do you know the Clydesdale Bank provided initial funding in many Middle East countries who only had sand prior to oil. Norway didn't get cash from selling fish, to finance exploration.
1695 2018-04-10 21:03:53 THE PEOPLE want to know what corp oil boys are paying you the bribes to RAPE our parks, STEAL our resources so they can donate even larger $ to the GOP pockets.
1696 2018-04-10 21:03:51 No...tried for a bit with no luck.  Was able to see that Dubai & Bank of China were involved in the gold for oil flows though, which was IMO a big hint, esp when CNY oil contract was later established in Dubai (early 2017.)  They must've liked how it worked?
1697 2018-04-10 21:03:45 That’s exactly why they’re so denounced. Can’t allow any critical thinking or public doubt when the decision to make £billions from weapons, steal oil & profit from generous rebuilding contracts has already been made.

1701 2018-04-10 21:03:23 @CanalandRivers what has happened in the Sandbach area of the Trent and Mersey canal? Lots of environmental people at an inlet, and oil on the canal.
1702 2018-04-10 21:02:58 @Paul_Gascoigne8  found an oil painting of a police sergeant in my loft. I took it to get valued and was told it's worth nothing, but it would have been worth a fortune if it had been a 'Constable'
1703 2018-04-10 21:02:49 really? Beating a oil club like Manchester City to make a CL semi final? Where they will fancy their chances against 2 out of the 3 semi finalist in Roma or Bayern?
1704 2018-04-10 21:02:46 I'd trust Grassley before I'd trust Zuckerberg, with anything, anytime.
He's given a life to public service. I don't agree with his right wing attitudes, but they are a product of his time and place. 
Zuckerberg is an emotionally underdeveloped snake oil salesman.
1705 2018-04-10 21:02:45 To clarify, the alternative to @TransMtn is oil-by-rail and us tankers along the west coast, so he is not protecting the Salish Sea, moreover under the Georgia Strait Reference BC has jurisdiction but will not put any provincial money into spill response 2/
1706 2018-04-10 21:02:41 Oh really? I was thinking it was cause my brother changed up his food. Ive been rubbing coconut oil on him and it only helps for a little bit
1707 2018-04-10 21:02:41 Or a more honest usd/gold/oil ratio.
1708 2018-04-10 21:02:33 I recall you tweeting about this and trying to find the actual volume of oil that was exchanged somewhere in the court filings. Did you have any luck?
1709 2018-04-10 21:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*

1717 2018-04-10 21:01:56 It was all to do with oil, and I think Syria is for the same reason and also because Israel wants some of the land in Syria
1718 2018-04-10 21:01:48 oh yeah for sure it's always best to be careful when buying things. I have sensitive skin and sometimes have issues with coconut oil so i have to look out for it. Here in California you're required by law to put warnings for almost everything, mostly cancer tho.

1726 2018-04-10 21:01:16 @IcelandRichard many congratulations for having the courage to say the truth that there's no such thing as "sustainable oil palm production" - this could be the beginning of a realisation by the commercial sector that biodiversity is worth infinitely more than quick profits.
1727 2018-04-10 21:01:09 2 headlines could be garnered from the BBC report that is linked to the article;

"North Sea oil and gas exploration at lowest levels since the 70s" or "North Sea oil discoveries hit a 10 year high"

No prizes for guessing which one they went with.

1746 2018-04-10 21:00:29 If only we could do this in the US. I studied the palm oil industry in my climate science class, there has to be a way for our food industry to stop the use of, and eliminate the use of palm oil.

1761 2018-04-10 20:59:43 Per Devon Energy Corp: "part of a plan to streamline operations and boost the shale oil producer’s sagging returns and stock price." Nothing to do with GPT. We lost 2800 teachers/support staff in 1 year (2016).

1764 2018-04-10 20:59:40 @AngeloJohnGage I live next to the largest producer of oil, should I move to some other place? #ww3

1766 2018-04-10 20:59:33 Massive oil deposit in Golan heights - mock oil company’s established by #ObamaClintonSyndicate Assad must be toppled for the wealth of the #UniParty . World war imminent
1767 2018-04-10 20:59:30 Finally did my oil change after 10k miles 
1768 2018-04-10 20:59:28 Oh yeah bihh, you gotta do better. Driving with no oil is some scary shit, you fuck around & gotta get a new Motor huh
1769 2018-04-10 20:59:28 we just spanked your £100bn oil team 5-1, get out my mentions
1770 2018-04-10 20:59:21 U won't have to worry about this, because of ur lack of investment in the state of the oil and gas industry no men will be working.
1771 2018-04-10 20:59:13 i realize i pay for it, but i'm truly grateful for the trash men. like whatever you want to get rid of (motor oil, used syringes, human appendages) you just toss into the trash bucket, and once a week off it goes to somewhere horrible about 10 miles away. #blessed
1772 2018-04-10 20:59:10 I'm calling you out for believing the latest Syrian MSM false flag and you're accusing me of believing one from 17 years ago? That's a huge failure in logic, bro.

Want to know why the deep state wants Syria so bad? Because they gave oil pipeline to Russia, and won't bow 2 Israel
1773 2018-04-10 20:59:09 The Central Bank wants 300bil yr; Mid East wants 300 bil yr; Russia splits all oil; China controls export/imports (sec transportation); Korea’s unite under false impression; USA takes all no one wants to work slave wages;
1774 2018-04-10 20:59:07 Well, I guess Louisiana has some decent shale oil/gas reserves, but that's about it.
1775 2018-04-10 20:59:00 As a fellow environment lover/coal hater, a slight correction (I made the same assertion once): NSP actually burns oil, not coal, at the Tufts Cove plant. Coal hasn't been used in many years. Not that it's any better (we also have wind turbines but not as many as we should).
1776 2018-04-10 20:58:56 What would I do without coconut oil.
1777 2018-04-10 20:58:51 Unicorn Oil fields as that what the 2 biggest finds on the planet are?? 
Come on its a 2 way street.
1778 2018-04-10 20:58:45 It’s frustrating when you smell nice and clean headed somewhere and as you drive, your hands smell like coffee because your steering wheel still has coffee oil from when you last worked  or when DSB oil drips on your hand when you take it from the oven. Smh

1782 2018-04-10 20:58:07 I guess you could say it educated people about oil sands, but hardly with the idea that fracking had some serious potential negatives. Or contribution to climate change.
1783 2018-04-10 20:57:59 PASSION VS OIL
1784 2018-04-10 20:57:48 Time to sell some more oil. Looks like the CL is going to cost more than you thought.
1785 2018-04-10 20:57:48 Lol it must sting to see your government actually falling all over themselves trying to give tax payers money to foreign oil businesses. Conservatives never needed to fo this they just created a friendly business environment to attract investment.
1786 2018-04-10 20:57:35 Just ate 4 pittas with a tub of hummus and chilli oil  food obsessed
1787 2018-04-10 20:57:28 @LFCTV My beloved through to semis on a day I found out Were having a little boy Also red men showed oil money doesn’t buy you everything! Crackin result for Roma too! Would like them in the next round 
1788 2018-04-10 20:57:26 April 1st is long gone but there's still a fool in Manchester and that's Pep Baldiola. What a fraud. Spent millions and millions of oil money over two seasons to loose out to a team that has James Milner and Henderson in their mid and Lovren as a CB. My fucking wordd. FUCK OFF!!
1789 2018-04-10 20:57:18 Congratulations To Liverpool and AS Roma 

PS: UCL Is Not For Babies... Money Can’t Just Buy The Trophy, Not Even The Abrab (Oil) Money PSG Can Relate.
1790 2018-04-10 20:57:14 @IcelandRichard has the courage to state "there's no such thing as sustainable palm oil" - his initiative could be the beginning of a global movement - within the commercial sector - to stop rainforest destruction.
1791 2018-04-10 20:57:10 I'm a little gobsmacked that our fed gov't is having an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss how to prop up a giant Texas oil company? KM is changing their strategy due to markets and money - its ALWAYS a $$ decision - and we should let them. Beyond ridiculous. #stopkindermorgan
1792 2018-04-10 20:57:07 i!hate!oil!pastels!
1793 2018-04-10 20:57:04 I’ve bookedmarked and liked so many of these vids but watched none of them... I’m probably gonna break and watch them 
1794 2018-04-10 20:56:56 Rouble down and Oil up russian oil more competitive
1795 2018-04-10 20:56:53 I've used them...and they're sometimes helpful. For example, I use peppermint oil to keep spiders away - and that totally works. I also have used the @younglivingeo Deep Relief and let me tell you...that stuff is magical. Best for sinus pressure due to allergies.
1796 2018-04-10 20:56:51 So @RachelNotley wants to be able to restrict flow of oil products from Alberta to B.C., but doesn’t want @jjhorgan to ba able to restrict the flow of oil products from Alberta into B.C.  it’s got two ends.
1797 2018-04-10 20:56:49 Good example this is all your good for telling people this crap when u should do better at your job because u are failing bad with gas and oil company's looking eles where
1798 2018-04-10 20:56:44 The only thing that makes my headaches go away is rubbing peppermint oil on my forehead and now I’m breaking out on my forehead I LITERALLY CANT WIN 
1799 2018-04-10 20:56:44 Don’t forget to grease the palm of the hand that gave you the oil 
1800 2018-04-10 20:56:37 Them Sheiks at Citeh will need even more Slaves to dig for Oil. More Oil. More cash. More players. #MCILIV #LFC #MCFC
1801 2018-04-10 20:56:33 Oil money wasted..
1802 2018-04-10 20:56:33 No. Look at the state of Alberta, it's a mess and they have had dirty oil money for decades. What has it done other than ruin the environment and make people dependant on more dirty money. Get a new plan! Leave BC off your filtly business plans.
1803 2018-04-10 20:56:24 I had high hopes for @ShellStationsUK ,am doing a YouTube video on their chargers soon.The one near me has nice shop, free WiFi , seating, and a Costa coffee machine. I still hold out hope for one in every Shell station so as oil dies, they transform into EV hubs and WiFi cafes!
1804 2018-04-10 20:56:20 Today I looked like a greasy fuck bc my hair just decided to become olive oil ....... I hate this
1805 2018-04-10 20:56:18 Absolutely and I love upstairs for material and oil cloth #LouthChat #BlueDuck
1806 2018-04-10 20:56:14 Pompeo is a walking disaster. I didn't like Tillerson at first but he was able to be diplomatic as he used to run a large oil company and had experience. Pompeo is a tea party politician who wants to target @JulianAssange and @wikileaks. I hope more oppose his appointment.
1807 2018-04-10 20:55:47 Man City thought oil money will lubricate their easy pass. #GGMU #MUFC. Congrats scousers for putting them in their oilfield.

1809 2018-04-10 20:55:38 The reason for the public vote for a delight in government is to voice the public views. 
Not to hire from the inside to keep a death grip . On their capitalist power. And with hold the crimes in the community.  Like watergate. And George Bush oil in 55gallon drums.

1814 2018-04-10 20:55:01 Ya silly dullard we just don't want more dirty oil investment. Bring on clean energy investment, you might have heard of solar, Tidal and geothermal? Probably not.

1816 2018-04-10 20:54:57 There are pipelines under most buildings in cities, carrying oil, natural gas, sewage, water, etc. And amen to that. It is the safest, cleanest and most economic way to transport any sensitive fluid medium.
1817 2018-04-10 20:54:55 Another great way to highlight the beautiful oil spills, dirt, and garbage from that state.
1818 2018-04-10 20:54:49 Also of note are the station oil lamps with their distinctive tops which I’ve not been able to track down. And is that an enamel running in board under the steps on the far platform waiting to be re-affixed following the paint job? There’s a distinct lack of signage of any sort!
1819 2018-04-10 20:54:47 I just want a full body massagewith some body oil 
1820 2018-04-10 20:54:38 Russian Counter Strikes Could Target Saudi ARAMCO And Other Oil Installations As Well As Tel Aviv Nuclear Plant Or Ammonia Plant Or Jerusalem.
1821 2018-04-10 20:54:37 OMG. I just laughed out loud and everyone just looked at me weird. 
1822 2018-04-10 20:54:29 Bia slalom mind yourself o. I cannot comman be doing like somebody that just drank gallon of oil
1823 2018-04-10 20:54:27 ME! I always wanna buy some dewy products to try it but like my face is already a damn oil slick
1824 2018-04-10 20:54:26 Oil changed, tires rotated, wheel alignment checked, induction process complete (whatever that is), Lawn mower battery charged & lawn mowed, boat batteries charged, items on back porch mostly stored away. Time for an adult beverage!
1825 2018-04-10 20:54:25 Oil companies should face charges for climate change that they knew about in the 1980's and kept secret!
1826 2018-04-10 20:54:17 If only someone could bring me a turkey sandwich from the bodega rn to the Honda dealer while I wait for this oil change  #starving
1827 2018-04-10 20:54:16 That’s grim as fuck! Defo avoiding palm oil
1828 2018-04-10 20:54:11 Man City, PSG and Barca all out. Football 1- Oil -0 . Marvellous. Entire states shouldn’t be allowed to fund football clubs.
1829 2018-04-10 20:54:10 Hey @NutellaGlobal ! When are you going to copy @IcelandFoods and stop using palm oil? Think of the orangutans and other creatures suffering because of the deforestation caused by palm Farmers.
1830 2018-04-10 20:53:47 They still look more like bears about to oil up and “wrestle each other” than a bunch of football hooligans to me hahaha
1831 2018-04-10 20:53:46 Of all the false flags, this one is the most blatantly obvious. You should also look into the oil and natural gas connections laid out by Nafeez Ahmed a few years back. Very interesting stuff.
1832 2018-04-10 20:53:40 Gang....oh dear were you subject to a debate....The facts depending who you choose to believe are up for debate. It was a fact that Oil was running out as stated by oil experts and economic forecasts...only it is not and now BP proudly announcing a massive find. 1/2
1833 2018-04-10 20:53:38 All over the oil found in the golen heights on the Syrian side.
1834 2018-04-10 20:53:36 Oil. A fuck ton of oil for ExxonMobil
1835 2018-04-10 20:53:26 Using GLD ETF - current IVR is 42.4. Im ok with ROI on this. Both positions added today was one contract each. Existing positions were 2 contracts so now a total of 3 strangles. Im ok with this in my account.. At current IVR on oil & gold, this is max size for now.
1836 2018-04-10 20:53:26 Depo provera. Hardly and oil. Hardly a good option.
1837 2018-04-10 20:53:18 I'd rather send a fucking Russell Stover box to every food stamp recipient in the country every day of the year than have one penny of my tax dollars go for ICE, or oil war, or shitty handouts for billionaires to buy yachts. Nobody puts dehumanizing conditions on their money.
1838 2018-04-10 20:52:52 I'll be back soon Fake Doctor, this cannabis oil ain't gonna extract itself. Unlike you trolls I can only spend so much time on Twitted.
1839 2018-04-10 20:52:44 Also to help against #climatechange ban the crypto cash NOW!Are you aware how much energy it takes to mine and get thoose cryptomoney safe?So much waist of energy can be used for better reasons and oil will be less needed! #ClimateAction
1840 2018-04-10 20:52:36 I love my essential oil diffuser so much. My room always smells so good and every day is a new scent. Today is mango.
1841 2018-04-10 20:52:36 Your league is a shambles. A crap league that random sheiks or sugar daddies can buy with oil. That's the joke on your and the exact reason your entire country is too shit to win anything for 50 years running now.
1842 2018-04-10 20:52:28 Simmering canned beans in olive oil for a few minutes -- brilliant!
1843 2018-04-10 20:52:27 And at this point I must either consider you a willfully obtuse parody or one who is unwilling to learn because it might change something they believe in. Like unicorns, or Bernie Claus.
1844 2018-04-10 20:52:21 What about the oil deal Sec Kerry’s son received?!?!! From the Ukrainians
1845 2018-04-10 20:52:20 I'm so surprised that someone like Pruitt is not only a spoiler and a oil co. foil, he's a liar, too!!  SHOCK AND HORROR
1846 2018-04-10 20:52:17 Palm oil has been on the agenda for years as a huge problem for wildlife,yet here we are in 2018 still only scratching the surface .
1847 2018-04-10 20:52:14 indonesia menempati Peringkat 2 dalam karet alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
1848 2018-04-10 20:52:06 Yes it’s rise is being unbelievable... I guess the chinese president’s words could have affected the oil price
1849 2018-04-10 20:52:06 who else know Angie that be selling the oils  her dumbass run Baltimore on the oil tip
1850 2018-04-10 20:51:50 Besides I would pay more to use a fuel that doesn’t poison my kids lungs, cause premature heart attacks/stroke/dementia and cancer, dripping oil on driveway, and high CO2 production
1851 2018-04-10 20:51:42 Roma came back from been 3 down but the great Pep could get City to even win. Man City going for the Quadruple & shit the bed. It’s been fun watching the implosion. Pep will be begging for another billion from the Arab Oil Money

1858 2018-04-10 20:50:52 Hah absolutely! Plus the lovely oil! 
1859 2018-04-10 20:50:52 Well Korol, Trump and his gang of war lords must be in a frenzy of enthusiasm this morning. They will never get a better chance, They can take Russia and China out at the same time, Get Syrian oil , Wipe out the pesky Palestinians. just think no Nord pipeline no Silk road:-))XX
1860 2018-04-10 20:50:40 We didn't invest billions in oil and realize we had to get it to markets. We've been trying all along. This isn't a new issue. But it's at a critical point now.
1861 2018-04-10 20:50:39 Can’t believe the quality/price ratio. I have the primer, foundation & vitamin C oil, with more products still on my hit list. But it took countless blogs to find out what to buy..
1862 2018-04-10 20:50:37 So where will they find the land to grow the crops which will be used to replace the palm oil?
(Understanding of course that they will need around 5x as much land as was used to grow the palm oil)
1863 2018-04-10 20:50:35 Soon they will have them emitting a smoke screen and an oil slick, to slow down possible assailants.
1864 2018-04-10 20:50:29 Dr locs leave in conditioner spray and Jojoba oil for the major WINNN!!!
1865 2018-04-10 20:50:25 Had an appointment to get my oil changed at 3...... I’m still here 
1866 2018-04-10 20:50:17 Scroll up pumpkin. You are QT me.
1867 2018-04-10 20:50:02 Your so called 'clean' sources a) don't produce enough energy when needed, b) require more energy to produce than they put out  c) have their own environmental impact. d) have a limited lifetime and in the case of wind energy still require oil to run, and coal for steel
1868 2018-04-10 20:50:01 Zuckerberg is just not right. I’m sorry . Snake  oil salesman. Please by my air, no strings attached.
1869 2018-04-10 20:50:00 Someone used Mint oil on my cracker to maintenance it so now my whips taste like mint QQ
1870 2018-04-10 20:49:51 I don't think it'll effect it too much at all to be honest. Expecting to see record production detailed within the next update and the negative press that Palm Oil received recently, including the BBC article regarding Iceland, will be long forgotten imo. Time will tell.
1871 2018-04-10 20:49:50 Coconut oil is everything 
1872 2018-04-10 20:49:35 People care more about the oil they put in their car, what video game they buy,  than what foods to eat, and taking supplements to NOURISH  the body.  
1873 2018-04-10 20:49:34 So it appears L'Oréal is selling 'rapeseed oil and sugar' scrubs.

That's locomotive lubricant and sweetener. 

Stand by for my range of Lithium grease and Oat Bran cleansers.

1880 2018-04-10 20:48:56 Props to Liverpool on beating our noisy neighbor. Their glorious history in Europe puts the loudmouth oil money in their place.
1881 2018-04-10 20:48:54 What ya gonna do when the fish oil all gone?
1882 2018-04-10 20:48:49 No. This is what happens in oil and gas, and when you don’t manage your business correctly. Taxes in Oklahoma are some of the lowest in the US. You’re full of BS.
1883 2018-04-10 20:48:43 Honestly! Palm oil is not the only environment issue. We need to change our entire economic system to combat climat change, creating  alternatives to sustain these countries' economy otherwise it won't clearly stop with this. I support your initiative but still perplex.
1884 2018-04-10 20:48:36 All Barca and City fans missing ...Where are they?...Where us their oil money..???
1885 2018-04-10 20:48:36 É o nosso grande ícone da capital, o Oil Man
1886 2018-04-10 20:48:35 Why is it that strange and forbidden weapons always seem to be in places where there's a lot of oil? Scripted narrative for the oil.

1920 2018-04-10 20:46:06 Life isn't going to get me down today.

Oil change has turned into fixing a recall on the car as well.  Still need to go read and sign my taxes too.  More laundry and cleaning in the works too.

I hate when streaming has to fall by the wayside.  Best laid plans...

1930 2018-04-10 20:45:35 lol another night for arsenal fan's that believe "cant compete w oil money" narrative. 2 good examples for how good coaching, competitive drive, organisation & smart spending can overcome almost anything. or at least put up a good fight.
1931 2018-04-10 20:45:35 You know it’s hot in LA when everyone’s complaining about their coconut oil melting
1932 2018-04-10 20:45:32 Where is your outrage over wild horses and burros being killed by our government? Wolves etc being killed by our government? Our government pushing people off their land for an oil pipeline? Oh you use natural gas? Guess you’re racist too then.

1943 2018-04-10 20:44:33 So, because Trump has removed all kinds of regulation, allowing industries to rape the land and poison the water even more, you think it would be to the benefit of ALL Canadians, if Trudeau said "have at it" to these oil executives? I guess we know how much you care about us, eh?
1944 2018-04-10 20:44:29 Woah bro you already struck oil quit drilling lol

1946 2018-04-10 20:44:23 Oil has gained a few percent up 3.5% $65.50  has rallied well from $62 from last week testing recent highs at $66.50 

DJI up up 428points to 24408 up 1.8% 

Gold cruising at $1340 US up .33% not much doing 

Copper is also traveling well up to $3.14 up 2% 
1947 2018-04-10 20:43:51 We didn't build oil reserves. They occur there naturally. Maybe you don't know that though.
1948 2018-04-10 20:43:49 Alberta could pay and pay, and lose it just like they lost the fund they set up for the oil industry.
1949 2018-04-10 20:43:49 I am so done w @pepboysauto. So busy trying to instill fear for an unnecessary $900 upsell, they didn't give me the oil change service type I originally requested! #byePimpBoys
1950 2018-04-10 20:43:37 Worst week in Manchester City recent history since they lost 8–1 to Middlesbrough in 2008. But to be honest there wasn’t any oil money so their fan base was wearing a different shade of blue #justsaying
1951 2018-04-10 20:43:30 Thanks Johnny! The displays are so colorful and eye catching. Tell Sherwin-Williams to ask for displays. :)  I painted my cabinets with oil based paint and wished so badly I had Big Wipes at the time. Amazing product. Yes, those are gallon sized refills in the background.

1967 2018-04-10 20:42:26 Well, sort of. The boiling water tends to bring the oil out of the fish heads.
1968 2018-04-10 20:42:23 Let's look at Muslim values shall we? Shias kill Sunnis & vice Versa for believing in the wrong type of Islam.  Christians routinely murdered. In 1950 120,000 Jews in Iraq, today less than 10. FGM. The Niqab. Endemic poverty in Muslim counties with no oil. Some values
1969 2018-04-10 20:42:13 EXACTLY! When you can buy officials’ loyalty and sway elections you ultimately create your own regulation. See: oil and gas industry, pharmaceutical, insurance, etc...

1978 2018-04-10 20:41:31 @ChampionsLeague it just goes to show how important the away goal is. Hard luck for @FCBarcelona just couldn't score that and defensive errors costed.

1982 2018-04-10 20:41:23 #Oil prices rebounded again, marking crude's best two-day rally in almost a month. US oil benchmark, crude benchmark, Brent, soared (3.6%) past $71 a barrel. Analysts expect Brent to rise up to $95 a barrel in the upcoming months.
1983 2018-04-10 20:41:11 We moved to increase our capacity by another 50% at the cost of a Javier Hernandez. 97 more years with increased ticket revenue. If we get taken over by a billionaire that is a king of an oil rich country then we'll be waiting a long time

1985 2018-04-10 20:41:00 "Saudi Arabia has created a Frankenstein's monster over which it is rapidly losing control." seems very fitting. What makes it worse is that the West did nothing to stop this activity, so obsessed they were with oil & arms sales. I have bookmarked this for future use.

1987 2018-04-10 20:40:52 Energy east is an existing gas pipeline.  Other oil lines mostly exist or with an agreed national energy plan could be built. It's not the pipeline it's what is in it.

1990 2018-04-10 20:40:47 Problem is state of the art engineering doesn't ensure many people's safety if 14 oil storage tank are added on top of existing 12 tanks on the south side of Burnaby Mountain. Technology is NEVER FOOL PROOF

1992 2018-04-10 20:40:45 You drinking fish oil again?
1993 2018-04-10 20:40:42 Alberta is not transferring the oil free of charge. Since they are SELLING the oil, it should be up to Alberta who they sell it to and how much they sell. BC can go pound sand. They can't have it both ways.
1994 2018-04-10 20:40:41 I have no idea how there have been any Oil bears since November 2016....
1995 2018-04-10 20:40:41 It has castor oil in it and other natural oils
1996 2018-04-10 20:40:37 Lab partner: the pipettor is getting slippery from the olive oil.             Me: yeah, olive oil will do that.      Lab partner: especially if it's extra virgin.                                                Lab partner:...that wasn't supposed to be dirty

SUCK IT, OIL MERCHANTS.

2003 2018-04-10 20:40:10 Business decision to stream line the operation of the company.  The low price of natural gas and crude oil dictate operational expenses. DEVON may be changing strategies with their field activities. Oklahoma just increased its production tax, which will affect the bottom line
2004 2018-04-10 20:40:08 Eskimos, Inuits hunting seal pups to harvest skins and sometimes oil is allowed in Canada.  Most are shot like this nowadays, and not clubbed in the head, as they used to be.  Main source of income for many of the indigenous arctic people living in Canada.
2005 2018-04-10 20:40:07 ((Pro tip: Lubricate your ass first (lotion, oil, ect.) to make it easier.
2006 2018-04-10 20:40:06 It would make sense if oil was processed in BC Refineries and lowering gas prices here instead of being shipped to China

2014 2018-04-10 20:39:30 Nope! I just did a rant on my IG about it actually lol I mix a drop with my aveeno lotion so it’s not just the straight up oil. It actually has made my face LESS greasy. by the end of the day my face is usually covered in oil, but after using jojoba my skin is WAY less oily
2015 2018-04-10 20:39:26 We just met. So you are joyful
2016 2018-04-10 20:39:26 “Hey I need an oil burner”
“We don’t sell oil burners.”
“Since when? I thought you guys have always carried them.” 
“We don’t sell crack pipes.”
2017 2018-04-10 20:39:18 I think he meant "me & my friends, kicking back in central Canada who won't be impacted by an oil spill and dgaf "
2018 2018-04-10 20:39:18 Shouldn’t of spent all that oil money on players 
2019 2018-04-10 20:39:13 Good for Iceland. Thought Charlie was a bit harsh saying they still stock branded products containing palm oil. At least their doing something about it and next step is to put pressure on their suppliers.
2020 2018-04-10 20:39:11 of course this price is cause funds, not cause stuff; theres a lot of oil
2021 2018-04-10 20:39:08 Moon Rocks are a cannabis buds  dipped in or sprayed with hash oil, then rolled in kief.

2026 2018-04-10 20:38:49 Oklahoma did the same thing by cutting oil production taxes significantly

2071 2018-04-10 20:34:39 Fact is the oil sands only make up 2% of Canada’s economy so the shrill rhetoric falls on deaf ears in BC.

2099 2018-04-10 20:32:51 The solution is to grow palm oil even more intensively and hence use fewer hectares of land to satisfy humanity’s appetite.
It’s not to swop palm for less efficient oil crops which require even more land.
2100 2018-04-10 20:32:47 Well @IcelandFoods - have raised their game by accepting there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil. Can't you walk like them, talk like them tooooo? #PalmOilAlarmCall

In the USA, the democrats take power in the house and senate.  Since we got VA, we have enough of a buffer to not require moving the Capitol from DC.  We also have the three largest ports on the East Coast, so oil and gas pipelines are interrupted briefly.

2141 2018-04-10 20:28:38 No. Your dismissed. A guaranteed benefit like Social Security or free tuition is an entitlement. The govt has to pay what ever it costs & it is not part of the budget, for things like the military, that makes appropriations. /1
2142 2018-04-10 20:28:26 Palm oil provides around 1% of humanity’s calories.  If you stop using it in foods, it needs to be replaced by an alternative oil.
The alternative oil then has a bigger environmental footprint than palm oil because it’s much less efficient to farm.
Ergo..worse for the environment

At Barcelona, he had Messi-- who alone is a tactical master-piece on his own; at Bayern, the club's policy is to weaken their opposition by buying their best players; at City, it is oil money where he'd spent almost £500m.
2175 2018-04-10 20:25:27 Manchester City (hundreds of billion dollars worth of oil money) 1 Liverpool (fairly ordinary wealth for one of the biggest clubs in the richest league in the world) 5.
Klopp, take a bow son. Pep, Hang that bald head. And ask for more cash!!!
2176 2018-04-10 20:25:24 Please investigate as this psychopathic war policy is a multinational one. Seeing mass slaughter of innocents for the gain of oil, land & geo-political power as moral.
2177 2018-04-10 20:25:20 Now now get the oil cheque book out city

2179 2018-04-10 20:25:00 Rex Murphy is a shill for the oil industry. You're better than this.

2181 2018-04-10 20:24:54 Pep has spent the last 20 Mins in the stands trying to talk himself up to the money men.. He was taken in to win ucl and given the money for that also.. This is a big spanner in the big plan for oil men
2182 2018-04-10 20:24:54 Thanks for playing, oil rich bastards, Goodnight and God bless.
2183 2018-04-10 20:24:51 Bennet likes to pretend he's a man of the people and hide the fact that he's a Vampire Capitalist. As the Mergers & Acquisitions man for the Corporate Conglomerates of Oil & Gas Billionaire Philip Anschutz, he's responsible for destroying competition, jobs livelihoods and lives.

2189 2018-04-10 20:24:24 Look. Lightning and human activity "starts fires". The fact that climate change dries out the forest and turns it into a tinder box is the fault of the oil patch and similar activity. We have always had forest fires. Climate change make them into super fires than nobody can fight
2190 2018-04-10 20:24:24 Nutella should take palm oil out of their spread @NutellaGlobal millions of jars sold all over the world
2191 2018-04-10 20:24:23 In terms of Oil-Politics-Event Football teams, it's Qatar nil - United Arab Emirates nil, I reckon
2192 2018-04-10 20:24:21 Get the fuck out you tin pot oil club.. made up.. up the red men!
2193 2018-04-10 20:24:19 100,000 lost orangutans in the last 16 years alone to clearing land for palm oil plantations. It’s so utterly sad.  We need more good news like this!!! We have to start somewhere! Great news!
2194 2018-04-10 20:24:17 Seguramente esta noche @flarrosa se sentirá orgulloso de haber favorecido a SBK Oil ayudando a que se desaloje el bloque #SoluciónRonda63 en lugar de haber hecho políticas sociales por conseguir alquileres sociales para las familias. Lo tendremos muy presente @angelrosdomingo

China declare Petro-Yaun for trading oil with gulf countries. Other side US increased tax and announce trade war against China. 
It seems that next financial crisis is coming.
2197 2018-04-10 20:23:58 MAN CITY CAN USE THAT OIL MONEY FOR THERAPY SESSIONS ON HOW WE DOMINATED THE TIE
2198 2018-04-10 20:23:57 We haven't been changing oil because seals only last about 2 years at best. This time we are doing all the bearings also. Hope to shin bearings tighter than factory spec. to save seals.

The various spices suspended in the oil made him think of planets and —
2201 2018-04-10 20:23:44 You made me cry as if you care about the Syrian people. Such a big lier you are, or you care about is oil and only oil. You count the vetoes Russia made tell me if you dare how many vetoes you made for Israel, like doubt it. Get lost and leave us alone
2202 2018-04-10 20:23:38 Obama talked up 'green-collar' workers in the environmental sector. 'Black-collar' has allegedly referred to those in mining/oil.
2203 2018-04-10 20:23:36 you think I have oil laying around
2204 2018-04-10 20:23:28 What fucking oil stain
2205 2018-04-10 20:23:20 Small in comparison. How many oil sands projects were approved & how much production was expected over those twenty years, & Alberta's achievement is 1 single refinery? Nice work planning for the future! Did a few people sober up & realized dependence on US refineries is a prob?
2206 2018-04-10 20:23:14 AMBASSADOR MY SUGGESTION LOOK FOR THIS OIL DISCREDIT ALL THESE LEADERS WITH THERE PEOPLE !THEY WILL BE REMOVED FROM POWER BY THERE OWN PEOPLE ;IF YOU CAN PROVE THIS!
2207 2018-04-10 20:23:11 I hate to cheer for Liverpool but I just love to see agony on the Oil club fan’s faces
2208 2018-04-10 20:22:54 Five minute break to change the oil on the robot.

2211 2018-04-10 20:22:42 #MCILIV Big clubs are big not because of oil money that bought star players and a star head coach. Big clubs are big, mainly because of the weight of their shirt and the glory that comes with it. Proud to be with #LFC . #YNWA #DankeKloppo
2212 2018-04-10 20:22:38 Bye bye City. Oil see you again, don't know where, don't know when. 
Plastic fannies supporting a plastic club.
2213 2018-04-10 20:22:36 Oil prices going up again after this performance to cover costs of a new team  .
2214 2018-04-10 20:22:32 Thx tons Jeff.. oil sure has been on a tear lately even with the COT data indicating record commercial shorts.

2218 2018-04-10 20:22:26 Socialism always crashes we have oil and resourses to buy us some time less spending would help

2224 2018-04-10 20:21:57 I am a resident of BC, and more worried about oil spills destroying our coastline and other’s way of life.
2225 2018-04-10 20:21:55 First up, I'm not an "oil shill" any more than you're a "lpinko nut job". We're two people who both care deeply about our community and want the best for it. We disagree but we can do so with respect. If you're interested in a discussion on that basis, let me know.
2226 2018-04-10 20:21:53 68. Tullow oil but club image ?
2227 2018-04-10 20:21:52 Instead of planning a war with Syria, we should be planning a war with Israel and Saudi Arabia. They both have us over a barrel with their private central banks and oil. They are bigger threats to Americans than anyone else in the world.
2228 2018-04-10 20:21:45 Since they got the oil money

2231 2018-04-10 20:21:25 Crude oil ought to be at $10 - $20 for a sustained period to have economic expansion.
2232 2018-04-10 20:21:20 He thinks he can just bluster his way out of this.  It’s been his schtick for decades.  Bamboozle people and sell them snake oil.  Carny barkers have more integrity.

2239 2018-04-10 20:20:50 The City fans really surprised me tonight. They have been shite. Created no atmosphere whatsoever. Without the oil money they are nothing. We’ve conquered all of Europe, we’re NEVER gonna stop.  Allez Allez Allez
2240 2018-04-10 20:20:47 AMBASSADOR THEY THESE LEADERS HAVE PLAYED YOU WHY THESE MILITANTS ENTER WILLIGNLY INTO BUSES THEY USED THEM TO KILL AND MOVE THE SYRIAN PEOPLE !ALL FOR OIL THERE COULD BE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OIL!
2241 2018-04-10 20:20:41 Rebuild our reputation? That's going to take too long. Russia needs to know we mean business. Sakhalin islands are juicy with oil or maybe a few subs go missing but we are near an end to a world order that 100s of 1000s died for. If we go down we go down fighting. HRC knew & TRIH
2242 2018-04-10 20:20:39 Alberta is only interested in making a fast box: ship the raw oil instead of refining it themselves. Its not the pipe line that’s the problem it’s what in it. If they are concerned about jobs then build refineries and supply the whole country!
2243 2018-04-10 20:20:37 Gender budgets? Give us a break, how ridiculous.  meanwhile,  $billions is being lost every month via 1) discounted CDN oil to the USA, 2) 900,000 bbl/day of imported oil and ) NO progress on pipelines east or west.... Harper got four pipes built. Liberals?? Zero.
2244 2018-04-10 20:20:37 Oil fan where u at
2245 2018-04-10 20:20:31 Went to Trader Joe’s to pick up a few things and bought pasta sauce (don’t judge me @yunggabagool ) and I can’t fcking use it because it has soybean oil in it

2248 2018-04-10 20:20:15 Oil of cloves. You can buy it at the chemist. Tastes vile but wipes out any feeling.
2249 2018-04-10 20:20:15 Girl you braaaaaave. But try a texturizer with oil on your hair then deep condition before your bleach
2250 2018-04-10 20:20:10 Can't lie, it feels good to watch City fans and players crying all those oil money tears
2251 2018-04-10 20:20:10 I think our Premier is in the cusp of grasping everyday folks use oil to live their lives. 250 angry drum beating Enviros will pale in comparison to the masses forced to eat a giant gas$ hike. Or maybe his razor thin majority will prevail...
2252 2018-04-10 20:20:08 Poor decision on the first goal for sure ... must have taken the oil money to get them an early goal
2253 2018-04-10 20:20:02 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas

2257 2018-04-10 20:19:51 My suggestion: teams of domesticated whales can be employed to tow the ferry without all that oil. Put giant harnesses on a team of humpbacks. That's a thing, right?
2258 2018-04-10 20:19:39 Oil Money 1-side with less money than Arsenal 2 (1-5 on aggregate)...

2263 2018-04-10 20:19:22 No worries Pep. No worries Qatar. Oil is still more than $60. You can spend more this summer.
2264 2018-04-10 20:19:18 European pedigree >>> oil money
2265 2018-04-10 20:19:13 Citeh are overrated @City_Watch @ManCity ...Good Night to Oil Money 
2266 2018-04-10 20:19:09 FUCK YOU CITY FUCK YOU PEP YOU PLASTIC OIL BASTARDS JAHAJAHAHHAHA
2267 2018-04-10 20:19:08 How much more you would be okay with them taking. You are proposing a huge entitlement program that will drive costs & regulation (more costs) up if you are talking about tax funded college.
2268 2018-04-10 20:19:06 Whether your your money comes from shops, pools, oil, tainted meat, shopping malls or mobile phones (or £1500 season tickets)!is pretty irellevant. Anyway you’d better go on and win it now to really piss off the Rags!
2269 2018-04-10 20:19:02 Haha woman is stupid to pour oil over engine

2272 2018-04-10 20:18:49 It’s not butter. It’s oil and applesauce that gives it the moist texture
2273 2018-04-10 20:18:43 Except Scotland has a very vibrant economy and doesn’t solely rely on Oil doesn’t it!  NS oil props up the U.K. £
2274 2018-04-10 20:18:42 This should be City's worst season ever since oil money, nothing different to what Mancini, Pellegrini achieved, man even achieved less
2275 2018-04-10 20:18:41 That’s great

I walked past frozenland today and they had Nutella on their shelves which is filled with palm oil

Every spread of Nutella= homeless 1 orangutan(just made up that statistic to grind your gears Andy Pandy,miss you moherfucker let’s grab a beer)
2276 2018-04-10 20:18:35 Passion > oil money
2277 2018-04-10 20:18:32 China doesn't plan to reduce oil consumption, they add more new drivers to their roads every year then Canada has drivers to begin with.
2278 2018-04-10 20:18:26  really funny coming from a fan of Manchester's second biggest team. It's a shame the oil momey cant buy you atmosphere

2285 2018-04-10 20:17:43 FIRMINHO!!! Just like P$G, #citeh spent all that oil money and still didn’t win . I hope Manuel Pelligrini is having a good laugh right now. #MCILIV

2287 2018-04-10 20:17:24 Renewable energy creates 8 time the jobs that oil and gas do. They cause a boom in the economy. If we invest in Renewable projects, the need for oil will go waaaay down very quickly.
2288 2018-04-10 20:17:23 My friend ordered some skin so soft from Avon . I forgot how good that shit smelled .. ima have to go ahead order some of this body oil ..
2289 2018-04-10 20:17:17 Day one of using rosehip oil on my face: actually noticeable improvement, impressed & surprised
2290 2018-04-10 20:17:17 i believe Oil is telling us something ..
2291 2018-04-10 20:17:09 Chef Louis cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with toothpaste.
2292 2018-04-10 20:16:56 could be up to a shitty oil inventory number to put crude and $XLE back in its place... up 3.3% today
2293 2018-04-10 20:16:55 I mean there is a lot of charity work that does get flown out and the government do fund aid abroad but in terms of politics I think it’s because the East lacks stability. Politics revolves around lies and money and the lack of infrastructure means they won’t make oil farms
2294 2018-04-10 20:16:53 Yes! Let's go to war because (((THEY))) told us that the big evil leader gassed a city he had JUST captured! Let's help (((THEM))) keep control of Russia-backed oil pipelines!
FIGHT, CONSUME, SLEEP.
2295 2018-04-10 20:16:45 Any other country in the world can have a currency, army, embassies, a seat at the UN, control its own immigration, tax its own oil, essentially choose its own future... except Scotland because the UK and is unionist advocates tell us Scotland is uniquely incapable. #ScotRef
2296 2018-04-10 20:16:42 how are people actually doing school right now like ... all i do during class is take buzzfeed quizzes about what essential oil i am
2297 2018-04-10 20:16:42 I just tried oil cleansing for the first time and bitch..............
2298 2018-04-10 20:16:41 Thought you just said a ScotPound would immidiately be de-valued (worthless I think you meant) so how can it be too expensive and de-valued? It would be partly based on the price of oil prices.

2300 2018-04-10 20:16:24 Instead of planning an attack on Syria, the United States should be planning an attack on Israel and Saudi Arabia. One's got us over a barrel with the bankers and the other with their oil.
2301 2018-04-10 20:16:21 @realDonaldTrump If you got the WALL ST. TRAITORS who keep taking the stock market down/up to stop taking gas/heating oil up you'd become the biggest hero in American politics. By letting them do it you're just like OBAMA.
2302 2018-04-10 20:16:12 Without the oil sands, there is not enough oil flow to build a pipeline.
2303 2018-04-10 20:16:08 Job done. Oil up to $70; US funds happy & Saudi happy. Inflation coming so banks happy. Iran deal next to take it $80 then watch global EM growth stall on high oil & commodity costs, then global growth stall.
2304 2018-04-10 20:16:03 Girl that mess dries me OUT. I use Neutrogena pads on my eyes, then an oil cleanser to remove MU. (And then I use another type of cleanser. Korean skincare FTW.) Wish a bar of soap would work for me! Makes my skin feel like the Sahara.
2305 2018-04-10 20:15:50 Grilled man, beautiful ribeyes, no marinade or sauce, good blend of spices added right before the grilling process and a little olive oil. I’m trying the reverse sear next though!

2307 2018-04-10 20:15:46 [9:10PM] @GiditrafficTeam: Riding towards JAKANDE LEKKI from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION is a slow and steady traffic #TrafficChief
2308 2018-04-10 20:15:45 No - the current pipelines are more than enough. Electric cars are going to make oil decline quickly in the next 2-3 years as people come to realize that #climatechange is upon us and we are fast running out of time to stop it.
2309 2018-04-10 20:15:45 I used coconut oil on my hair today and thought of you @nabeelahchothia. My hair feels amazing! I can't stop playing with it!!!! 
2310 2018-04-10 20:15:42 from you profile: "garbage made in China" - you mean all the value add stuff they make with our raw materials? Sounds like you want to transfer a huge part of our oil industry's profits to China & only benefit from the scraps. Seems anti Canadian!
2311 2018-04-10 20:15:38 Actually, not many Canadian oil & gas companies are able to run a profitable business, let alone grow production. This is entirely due to the market challenges we have been forced to live with (lack of pipelines). We have world class assets with limited market access.
2312 2018-04-10 20:15:36 I dunno - IMO condiments don't count, regardless of olive oil content
2313 2018-04-10 20:15:29 It’s true when woman just hop in the car and go. They don’t know if the brakes good, tires, or oil. Then when you ask them they say idk that’s not my job 
2314 2018-04-10 20:15:26 Are they better for you in olive oil or sunflower oil?
2315 2018-04-10 20:15:25 Point I’m making is city have only won these trophies the past few years due to their Abu Dhabi oil money . If another oil country bought West Brom and paid silly salaries and huge fees then they would win the league eventually too . Anyway best of luck in the semis 
2316 2018-04-10 20:15:18 If those holy books were written today we would see peanuts, sugary drinks, palm oil and gluten described as abominations.
2317 2018-04-10 20:15:09 Thanks i'm happy to know that ^^' 
Well you should try oil or things like that maybe it will help you a bit ?
2318 2018-04-10 20:15:07 Oil of cloves 
2319 2018-04-10 20:15:07 I use the ketoconazole they prescribed to me, right along with the fluocinolone topical oil and the hyrdrocortisone but it I swear it works when it wants !!
2320 2018-04-10 20:15:05 I'm not a fan of the oil sands, but our world still needs roads.
2321 2018-04-10 20:15:03 @IcelandFoods  have become the first and only to ban the use of Palm Oil in all of their own brand products. This is a massive step in the fight against deforestation and preserving habitats for many animals, including elephants and orangutans. Well done Iceland 
2322 2018-04-10 20:14:57 @sonjustdont5 did zendaya use vitamin d or c oil w her skin care routine i can’t remember and i don’t wanna go find the tweet
2323 2018-04-10 20:14:51 Joking aside, clove oil does take the edge off it quite a bit
2324 2018-04-10 20:14:50 I also know that England will still buy our Electricity, gas, oil and food products no matter what currency we want them to buy them in. Imagine the little Englander saying, "we're not buying your electricity in a ScotPound even if our lights will go off!"
2325 2018-04-10 20:14:47 Guardiola has royally fucked himself and his little oil princesses up  maybe next season “The best team ever” will win it for the 1st time in their history...
2326 2018-04-10 20:14:41 5/

wells
pumps

oil heat
propane heat
wood heat

stacking firewood
tarps
tractors (cat 1 vs 2 vs 3, front end loaders, front end loader accessories such as bucket forks, debris forks, root rippers)
logging chains
2327 2018-04-10 20:14:40 @GeorgeMurphyOil Looking to order furnace oil, should I wait till Thursday or go for it now?
2328 2018-04-10 20:14:38 Ack! So weird. Olive oil and almond oil work too and might be worth a try. Everyone’s skin is so different, which is pretty amazing and cool. Maybe you just have a hand-soap-kinda-face, you know?
2329 2018-04-10 20:14:24 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
2330 2018-04-10 20:14:02 God bless u. I dunno why niggas act like they dunno we were sliding into a recession right from Jonathan. When anybody can tell me why our reserves where virtually empty even tho oil prices were at record highs then imma listen. Iono if economies just magically fix themselves
2331 2018-04-10 20:13:58 I really only use my microwave for when I’m about to do a hot oil treatment on my hair 
2332 2018-04-10 20:13:57 We just put in a HUGE essential oil order! It should be here by the end of the week...
2333 2018-04-10 20:13:53 try putting peppermint oil on your temples and back of your neck, i get them really bad and that helped me
2334 2018-04-10 20:13:44 Is anyone making seal oil capsules locally? The more biproducts we can harvest, the more profitable and sustainable the hunt will prove. I'd buy local.
2335 2018-04-10 20:13:43 clove oil..
2336 2018-04-10 20:13:42 A cynic would say a big oil company is setting these Charges up to fail to discredit EV charging. A 30kW Leaf from empty would cost £14.70. By comparison other networks would cost £2.70-£10. Hence @ShellStationsUK will get used less when cheaper alternatives are available.
2337 2018-04-10 20:13:38 Do not create mess in the first place. Iraq and Syria were secular( dictatorships yes) progressive with nothing to do with Jihadis. Oil lobby, ensure energy needs theorists, Israel with CIA unnecessary involved Syria. By attacking Syria again you will creatw next civil war.
2338 2018-04-10 20:13:38 oil will run out before that happens and we will have more than 20 by that time anyway 
2339 2018-04-10 20:13:36 felt so good to wash & oil my hair 
2340 2018-04-10 20:13:32 Syria is the only crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories. According to the Oil and Gas Journal, Syria had 2,500,000,000 barrels (400,000,000 m3) of petroleum reserves - 1 January 2010
2341 2018-04-10 20:13:32 The risk to Washington State from a catastrophic oil spill is unacceptable. #NoPipelines #NoKinderMorgan #conservation #PowerPastOil
2342 2018-04-10 20:13:27 Hasn’t Murdoch got an interest in Golan Heights oil.....? 
2343 2018-04-10 20:13:22 $billions is being lost every month via 1) discounted CDN oil to the USA, 2) 900,000 bbl/day of imported oil and ) NO progress on pipelines east or west.... unless, of course we're talking about pipes for EnergieSaguenay in Que, or for offshore oil in the Maritimes
2344 2018-04-10 20:13:13 Norway courts ruled they are not responsible for downstream emissions of exported oil. Is Norway a "developing country"?
You're an idiot.
2345 2018-04-10 20:13:12 Learn the difference between oil and bitumen. Bitumen by rail is quite safe. It is totally inert and near solid so it doesn't even spill.
2346 2018-04-10 20:13:06 Stockport will be dead tonight. All the oil money in the world can't buy you history, fans and passion #mcfcvlfc
2347 2018-04-10 20:13:06 ありがとうございます～。ゼタはかわいいのです。
光ガードスキル持ちらしいので育ててみます。
2348 2018-04-10 20:13:01 A modern well engineered pipeline poses only minimal risk to the environment. The environmental benefits of lower energy use to move oil far outweigh the potential risks. Build the bloody thing!
2349 2018-04-10 20:13:00 This is great Doug you went all the way to talk for 18 seconds. I wonder what snake oil we would hear you sell if you had open media. Don't your followers usually connect "controlling the media" with more nefarious things?
2350 2018-04-10 20:12:48 Ay i went to a pizza place and all they gave me was salad and no dressing except oil so France Cancelled.
2351 2018-04-10 20:12:48 Standard Oil....I mean @facebook is just too darn big. Time to break up Ma Bell....I mean @facebook
2352 2018-04-10 20:12:43 Oil pipeline from Iraq through Syria to Med.sea. or Iran through Syria. Syria loses either way. Follow the money,& go scout the wikileaks,etc. on the issue.
2353 2018-04-10 20:12:39 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
2354 2018-04-10 20:12:36 “With the downturn in oil markets that started about two or three years ago, demand for new pipeline projects has also declined significantly,” said Tom Gunton, director of Simon Fraser’s Resource&Environmental Planning Program &former deputy minister of BCs environment ministry”
2355 2018-04-10 20:12:35 Pipelines are a move toward a more efficient way to transport oil, that means it's a more environmentally sound way to ship oil.
2356 2018-04-10 20:12:22 Who suffers with Restless Leg Syndrome also know as RLS???

I have suffered with it for 2 years and I've now been 4 weeks FREE from this annoying condition because of this OIL !!!
2357 2018-04-10 20:12:16 Not yet! I just fry them in a little oil and salt. I'm slowly learning how to eat/cook healthy 
2358 2018-04-10 20:12:07 Trudeau announces Ontario Pipeline for dilbit and tar sands oil. "It will be built, even if we have to harm the Ontario economy, it will be built, Ontario voters have NO say in the matter. It will be built." #onpoli #bcpoli
2359 2018-04-10 20:12:01 Backed with oil reserves....mmmm.. sounds like Venezuela.
2360 2018-04-10 20:12:00 The @bcndp & @jjhorgan are defending BC province against the risk of diluted bitumen spills that threaten its economy, environment and coast.

What did our teachers taught us about confronting fears and manage risks.

(How come Saudi Arabia rarely have oil spills.)
2361 2018-04-10 20:11:58 Hey I wasn’t ignorant with you. I don’t trust google too many snake oil salesman’s on there. By the way paint making has been my life and all ingredients for that type of heavy use has dangerous chemicals in it. But you keep on believing everything on google.
2362 2018-04-10 20:11:56 I waxed my tool box this morning just got this asshole to spill oil all over it.. thanks guy next thing of spray wax is on you
2363 2018-04-10 20:11:53 "Anime Right News"? That's a bunch of smoke and mirrors. The motivations in Syria are simple they revolve around who would control new oil pipelines in the M East, through Syria to Europe -Russia/Iran or Saudi Arabia. McCain/ Clinton/ Obama picked Russia/Iran.
2364 2018-04-10 20:11:44 That's only if there's demand for the oil. At present demand for Alberta crude is pretty low and so is the price. Companies will not ramp up production just because there's a pipeline; only if demand and price increase.
2365 2018-04-10 20:11:38 I'm fine with turning Redneck America into a third-world country if it means we can invade and take their oil!
2366 2018-04-10 20:11:34 Scratching my head trying to figure out what’s so bad about trying to convince a pipeline company to cancel their expansion project because the tanker component is too risky. As a marine oil spill expert, that’s my professional responsibility, folks!
2367 2018-04-10 20:11:30 A guy turned up at our house this afternoon in connection with our oil tank saga. I recognised him almost instantly from my folk music days (so, 25 yrs ago), as someone I only previously knew as 'John the Fanny'.

For the record, JtF appears to be a lovely bloke now.
2368 2018-04-10 20:11:28 i wonder is a lot of activism against oil projects  secretly funded by competitors in order to slow or stop a project that threatens their business?
2369 2018-04-10 20:11:28 I’m neutral.   There has to be a cost effect way to move this sludge without putting our environment at risk.  Double wall the pipe line maybe?   Build a refinery closer?   We rely on so many products from oil but I’d like to see change towards greener future/resources.
2370 2018-04-10 20:11:27 In the old days a man like Trump, a snake oil salesman would be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail.
2371 2018-04-10 20:11:20 You can swish coconut oil around for a few minutes too. It detoxifies your gums/your whole body (through your tongue) and removes decay. I do it 4x a week for 20 min.
2372 2018-04-10 20:11:12 Brutal. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a legend. I can't come to poker tonight.
2373 2018-04-10 20:11:05 Hey, for the armour I would use Caliban green, Nuln oil, & highlight with Loren Forest. For the trim, leadbelcher, shade with Biel-Tan green, glaze with waywatcher green & highlight edges with Stormhost silver. Thin down some scrag brown for the rust effect. Hope this helps.
2374 2018-04-10 20:11:05 I’d say yes, they just have different collection mechanisms. It’s like drilling for oil or getting it from shale, the product is still the same.
2375 2018-04-10 20:11:04 Yes good idea, now if we can just get more people looking into over unity and other non oil energy forms!
2376 2018-04-10 20:11:03 gonna open short on oil here at $65.7 pray for me
2377 2018-04-10 20:11:03 A Scottish Currency backed with over a Trillion £s of oil reserves?  Are you really that desperate that you throw all sorts of spurious assertions around?  The only currency to be hurt will be the £ and that’s why your under orders to protect the union no matter the truth
2378 2018-04-10 20:11:00 Bye oil FC
2379 2018-04-10 20:10:59 done with the oil slathering anyways hows your guys days today
2380 2018-04-10 20:10:59 You’re not concerned with the recent oil leak? Of course your not. You will be long dead befor the full impact of the current EPA is felt. The hell with your heirs. Let them fend for themselves. Right?
2381 2018-04-10 20:10:58 The guy changing my oil told me that my engine is going to explode anf it will be catastrophic... I think I just learned the cause of my death
2382 2018-04-10 20:10:54 I'm not bothered about their fans. City are a new club founded in 2008 on oil money. I'd want them to beat Liverpool at tiddliwinks
2383 2018-04-10 20:10:51 I thought a “shell company/corporation” was just vernacular for shady oil companies becau….
2384 2018-04-10 20:10:44 Zuck asked for 15 minutes…

An average mechanic should be able to manage a hard reset and oil change in that time, expect Zuck to come back refreshed after the break.
2385 2018-04-10 20:10:28 Riding towards JAKANDE LEKKI from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION is a slow and steady traffic @Gidi_Traffic

2388 2018-04-10 20:10:12 Promise I haven’t. I have my own kids in college & we like guns and ammo too. I am sure @Oil_Guns_Merica won’t hold it against me. 

What percentage of your wages is it okay for the government to take with your current bills?

2390 2018-04-10 20:10:07 Am glad the proggressives are talking with a stick up their arse about Musk. I take it personal how bad capitalists can get away with stuff that salts the earth.
Oil barons are the worst at this, and I encourage the divestment from banks+institutions which pay their pipes.
2391 2018-04-10 20:10:01 ...and people wonder why the FBI raided his offices???
"Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company?"
2392 2018-04-10 20:10:00 Changed my oil in jorts today. 24 is going well so far if I do say so myself.
2393 2018-04-10 20:09:55 Me sef i want perfume oil
2394 2018-04-10 20:09:38 Done team @saloni_oil
2395 2018-04-10 20:09:38 Know you think you're invicible but 1)Russia 2) 2000 US troops in Syria will be targeted 3) Israel will be bombed 4) price of oil will hike
2396 2018-04-10 20:09:33 just tried oregano oil and i literally feel 10x better instantly it was disgusting but it worked
2397 2018-04-10 20:09:30 Kobil watu huwa wanaongeza mafuta ama oil. .@stella_katiwa alikuwa hiyo area ..si mnajua alikuwa anaongezwa nini ?? @ben_ndunde @HomeboyzRadio @didgethesinger @JaymoUleMsee @Demakufu #mtaanihbr

2399 2018-04-10 20:09:19 Oil money didn’t make our club. It made yours
2400 2018-04-10 20:09:19 Well done @Waitrose. I’ve been using one of your reusable cups for a number of years now. What news re palm oil and excess plastic packaging?
2401 2018-04-10 20:09:05 Feel free to research... that terribly old fashioned thing "old people" do to understand topics they're not familiar with... 'Standard Oil'.
2402 2018-04-10 20:09:04 Have you checked to see if they had ties to oil companies? Or did you just stop at the dual citizenship?
2403 2018-04-10 20:08:59 Day 5: Have a self care day today! Do ya nails, put coconut oil in your hair, have a bubble bath, etc. 

Day 6: Try to stay off your phone for at least half of the day. You’ll be much more happier and energetic trust me.
2404 2018-04-10 20:08:57 These parts of the article “That solution may be to focus on another pipeline project to get Alberta’s oil to world markets with less environmental risk, he said.”
2405 2018-04-10 20:08:54 I bursted into tears and my teacher frantically dabbed some lemon oil on my tissue cause citrus cures depression wooooh
2406 2018-04-10 20:08:48 Gonna need some additional oil $$
2407 2018-04-10 20:08:45 However....please may I ask what is going to be used instead of palm oil, and can we guarantee it won’t come from a monoculture that destroys the habitat of another species? Cheers
2408 2018-04-10 20:08:42 These ones are clearer, unlike the Separatist ones about having 91% of oil, when that means £80M, not the £BNs assumed and lied about.
2409 2018-04-10 20:08:40 Why you don't support our prosperity.  You already have two major pipelines approves but as usual oil knows no limit to self destructing greed.  We should advocate for something toxic to run through Lake Louise, see how you like it.
2410 2018-04-10 20:08:37 Um, and the oil leak? How does that affect drinking water
2411 2018-04-10 20:08:34 IMO, if my land were adjacent to Nestle's, MY individual property rights would be infringed upon if my next-door neighbor was sucking the Oil/Gas/Gold/Water out from underneath me fence.
2412 2018-04-10 20:08:19 Another £300m of oil money in the summer @ManCity? What a shame Otamendi failed in his task to get Mane sent off... #championsleague #mcfclfc
2413 2018-04-10 20:08:08 Just because of they're oil, why do the US n British bulling other countries?
2414 2018-04-10 20:08:05 Did you know: Dr. Dembar from the University of Cincinnati discovered  that inhaling Peppermint oil increased the student’s mental accuracy by  up to 28%?

2418 2018-04-10 20:08:00 You ain’t said nothin slick to a can of oil, MF  Now let that shit sink in for a min. I’m a seasoned professional 
2419 2018-04-10 20:07:42 Oil is not the best way of creating energy anyway. There far better ways and do no harm to the environment and are way cheaper for the consumer. Just like the electric car, the idea is good but a moving car should be able to recharge itself!

2425 2018-04-10 20:07:09 When you realise all ye oil money can’t buy you champions league success
2426 2018-04-10 20:07:05 Thanks Trump, big oil.
2427 2018-04-10 20:07:03 Oil money won’t win you the UCL
2428 2018-04-10 20:07:01 Just an oil club who has bought all your success 
2429 2018-04-10 20:06:59 It was phacelia, turnip rape, oil reddish, oats. Sprayed off about 6 weeks ago, would have liked to have drilled following crop allot sooner following termination. It was also topped in early December.
2430 2018-04-10 20:06:56 no its coconut oil
2431 2018-04-10 20:06:52 Lots in the Golan Heights of Syria too. Ask Murdoch and Rothschild, they sit on the board of Genie Energy, an Israeli run company. More oil there than there is in Saudi Arabia. Maybe they need all that oil for the elite's space ambitions (which will NOT benefit us!)
2432 2018-04-10 20:06:41 Jake Byrne has taught this feral femme so much regarding beauty and hygiene! 

Ah, I've tried coconut oil but it weirdly dried out the skin on my eyelids and brows, so I've just kept the oil for my hair.
2433 2018-04-10 20:06:37 Close u first on beef  destiny from where in USA exist a Chinese farm of Mexicans! Movie  @TomCruise robot  say @Walmart is the employer! Robots  decisions are oil most important so slap GMO sign on meat and stop killing cows ! Because all life must live! Plants  next
2434 2018-04-10 20:06:29 De nada. I would also recommend the Modern Botany oil. Again all natural and made in West Cork. Right, sales pitch over :)
2435 2018-04-10 20:06:27 That may be so, but for me, and a lot of others due to the replies, that doesn’t take away the benefit and positivity that ecosystems in Borneo + other places will experience if more retailers drop palm oil and it is something to be praised, regardless of the motive behind it.
2436 2018-04-10 20:06:15 When I was in the 4th grade, my class was shown a video about the damage done by an oil spill, and then instructed to write a letter to the President, demanding that all oil tankers be double hulled.

2440 2018-04-10 20:05:28 Have you not been paying attention? Either MOAR OIL or you shut it all down today. Sorta like arguing against MOAR CARZ means you want to ban all cars. 
False dichotomy is the heart of all bullshit politics.
2441 2018-04-10 20:05:25 All that oil money and you still can’t get to the semi
2442 2018-04-10 20:05:25 @MarksnSpence Please can you stop putting Palm Oil in your products, my burrowing bunny easter egg was awful, even worse knowing that rainforest was destroyed and wild animals murdered in the creation of it..
2443 2018-04-10 20:05:16 Your BC wildfires due to climate change cause by projects like the oil patch in northern AB.
2444 2018-04-10 20:05:16 Is there a greater environmental impact than continually losing more+more rainforest?/It takes 1 hectare of rainforest2provide 1 hectare of palm plantation/Also a large % of the time it isnt necessary to use palm oil+the planet breathes because of rainforest/Also use less fat+oil

2449 2018-04-10 20:04:53 Dean, say you are the property owner adjacent to Nestle's. That water table underneath your property isn't blocked by an inivisible wall. Nestle is sucking your water from under your feet. Don't care? What if it were OIL???
2450 2018-04-10 20:04:47 Egypt is north African Arabian country , but totally agree with you regards the oil money

2455 2018-04-10 20:04:17 I know if she becomes bedridden (is there a better word for that?) she will lose her positive mental outlook. She's started medical CBD oil & that's helping some of her pain.
2456 2018-04-10 20:04:03 @Thinkersact there in lies the problems, social media, oil corps, pharmaceutical co. Etc. Hell even the justice system especially family law all corrupt.

2463 2018-04-10 20:03:00 @CBDivaHealth Thanks for the follow. Could you help me with dosaging of CBD oil. I have a 15ml/500mg bottle. I’m using for chronic pain eventually. I’ve calculated 7 drops a few times a day. Does that sound about right? Info has been confusing. Hope it helps.
2464 2018-04-10 20:02:54 The RSPO won’t be sending you a Christmas card! They don’t like negative news about palm oil! Good decision though - get that stuff out!
2465 2018-04-10 20:02:48 I know it may be hard to believe, but oil and gas development is actually profitable in Canada. Even in Wood Buffalo and also in BC. Thus your governments new major LNG investment.
2466 2018-04-10 20:02:44 Goodness, I hope you're right. The tech giants need to be broken up. It's like the turn of the last century with the oil and steel barrons. They are too big and it's causing democracy failure. #Zuckerberg #Facebook
2467 2018-04-10 20:02:37 Yeah me too. I’m glad all the oil clubs are gone now. Liverpool will be gone in the semis hopefully!
2468 2018-04-10 20:02:33 Sorry I'm one of those annoying people who puts olive oil and nutritional yeast on his popcorn

2473 2018-04-10 20:02:14 Got my oil change out the way now 4-12
2474 2018-04-10 20:02:14 Sustainable and eco friendly palm oil or no palm oil. Guilt doesn't taste that good.
2475 2018-04-10 20:02:12 JUST PURE COCONUT OIL IT DOES WONDERS

2477 2018-04-10 20:02:01 I can't stand wild growth hair oil it's too greasy and smells terrible.
2478 2018-04-10 20:01:56 Aye, this is the time and place to discuss it. If you don't want to or if it's affecting you, it's time to step away. As you say, politics is everything & as somone with business experience, this is not about palm oil, it's about money/politics.
2479 2018-04-10 20:01:42 That one think say Na Nigeria wey dem go mix oil.
2480 2018-04-10 20:01:42 Cooking oil-fish oil
2481 2018-04-10 20:01:36 The are several oil companies that would disagree with you, I think.
2482 2018-04-10 20:01:27 Whoa! Pete Holmes just addressed the latest TJ Miller controversy:

2486 2018-04-10 20:01:12 Technological advances have increased the life of most engine belts and hoses. However, have them inspected for wear every time you change your oil. This intercepts problems before these parts fail and bring your car to a halt.
2487 2018-04-10 20:01:10 Yeah, sorry.  I'm not into debt-funded tax cuts for billionaires; travel bans (which Trump appointed judges have already shot down); systemic deregulation (which leads to Wall St. crashes, oil spills, etc.); or withdrawal from Paris accords.  But nice try.
2488 2018-04-10 20:01:02 Money can't buy you everything! Arab money is good for oil not football.
2489 2018-04-10 20:01:01 Castor oil??
2490 2018-04-10 20:00:58 Coffee drinking is actually good for the economy, as it is the second-most-traded commodity in the world, right behind oil. In fact, it helps stimulate the economy of smaller developing countries who farm some 90 percent of the world's coffee plantations.
2491 2018-04-10 20:00:54 JAPAN: This vegetarian noodle dish with fried tofu is great, let's add a ton of meat to it

2496 2018-04-10 20:00:39 I brought Piper with me to get an oil change and as soon as we get off she poops by the front door

2504 2018-04-10 20:00:17 Never thought there would be a day when I wanted Liverpool to win a game of football but that day has finally arrived. A proper football club with history vs an oil princes play thing. As long as they get stuffed in the semis
2505 2018-04-10 20:00:17 I've never checked the oil in my car and apparently thats bad, also according to the sticker on my windshield I'm a thousand miles over when I was suppose to get an oil change
2506 2018-04-10 20:00:13 It’s British, you are British, you are very lucky to be British, you can like it, or lump it!
I’m afraid Scottish produce, also British, won’t keep our public services afloat, oil is costing us, only 44% of Scots pay tax, & due to SNP increasing tax many might relocate South.

2510 2018-04-10 19:59:53 I just think there seems to be a good fad all the time. Gogi berries, turmeric, spirulina, coconut oil. Probably doesn’t do any harm, but I doubt it’s a wonder tonic or anything 
2511 2018-04-10 19:59:48 Fuck off with your oil money @ManCity
2512 2018-04-10 19:59:40 Oil money machine sinking,Klopp just know how to humiliate pep
2513 2018-04-10 19:59:31 I know everyone is excited for the @ChickfilA opening in Greece, but keep in mind that they use peanut oil to fry everything in so this may not be a safe place for friends with allergies.
2514 2018-04-10 19:59:26 thanks. So now and then is not really comparable. Very helpful because looking at the chart of oil (or gold for that matter) has but one message: UP!
2515 2018-04-10 19:59:22 I just wanna cook and I can’t. Fuck oil man 
2516 2018-04-10 19:59:18 They said Quadruple you know . Enter Wigan a division two team. They said Treble you know . Enter liverpoop, the worlds team tonight. They said they’d be the greatest prem team ever.... jokes on the oil money.
2517 2018-04-10 19:59:13 .@LindseyGrahamSC calling @facebook a #Monopoly is absurd.

There are hundreds of competitions to #Facebook since they don’t span single industry. Standard Oil had no real competition in one industry. Archaic Monopoly anti-trust ideology wont work. #Zuckerberg #FacebookDataLeaks
2518 2018-04-10 19:59:02 No oil $$$ is enough, ask psg
2519 2018-04-10 19:59:00 The US consumes 20 million barrels of oil per day and exports 1.5 million barrels per day. Both growing. Almost all oil is transported in pipelines. It's not the pipes it's the oil. Change how we use oil, not pipelines. Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil.
2520 2018-04-10 19:58:36 Bruh my pedicurist is spending more time massaging my legs and knees with lotion and oil than he is actually painting my toes lol

2524 2018-04-10 19:58:16 My hubby just put one drop of wintergreen essential oil on our vacuum filter and now my house smells fabulous! You could do that with one drop of any of your favorites. Might not want to do it often so you don't damage the filter in any way 
2525 2018-04-10 19:58:13 City fans should go out and support their team with buying a pint of oil at the local garage

2535 2018-04-10 19:57:36 Love dat snake oil!

What’s (almost) surprising is that, as 21st C populations, we’re still not past snake oil sellers. Pretty much the same applies here (with the lower risk of civil war, but equal likelihood of social unrest).
2536 2018-04-10 19:57:08 WoW..... that’s a nice gun 
2537 2018-04-10 19:57:04 Well they did. Just last year. And that Band has zero unemployment. Good for them work with the Oil Patch.
2538 2018-04-10 19:57:02 The offering of the poor. 
Leviticus 14:21-24   
"21 " But if he is poor and cannot afford it, then he shall take one male lamb as a trespass offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, a log of oil..."
2539 2018-04-10 19:56:50 Same as oil price and gasoline price. No real correlation.
2540 2018-04-10 19:56:40 I’m sure Rockefeller said similar about ownership of Standard Oil.
2541 2018-04-10 19:56:36 Jake Byrne is an angel and sent me some perfume samples recently. So amazing to hear he’s bequeathing beauty and wellness products all about town!! 

(PS: Use oil instead of hand soap, it won’t burn and it will take less scrubbing!) 
2542 2018-04-10 19:56:35 They guy at the shop asked me what kind of oil I wanted. Like car oil???? Idk??
2543 2018-04-10 19:56:27 China creates magnificent wildlife refuges to save its dwindling and endangered wildlife... the United States meanwhile opens it National Parks and Wildlife Refuges to gas and oil exploration... what’s wrong with this picture? Who could ever have predicted this day would come?
2544 2018-04-10 19:56:17 As the geopolitical tensions mount, oil prices went from 47 dollars to 71 dollars in a year. 50 percent increase.
2545 2018-04-10 19:56:09 The Zuckerberg Testimony reminds me of the scene in Short Circuit 2 where Johnny 5  is torn apart; throwing sparks, spurting oil, trying the figure out why his arm is off.
2546 2018-04-10 19:56:04 So why wasn't it appropriate in Myanmar?  No oil?
2547 2018-04-10 19:55:47 I spilled oil everywhere

2549 2018-04-10 19:55:39 Assad not guilty of this chemical attack  all with a brain know thisThe world does not need another war It's our sons and daughters  that will pay the price with their lives so Israel can take the oil which is in the golan heights The Syrian lands are coveted by many

2573 2018-04-10 19:52:51 I guess they are the result of overuse in humans - just not due to over prescribing by docs.  Anna, had no idea the bacteria bred to use in oil spills was so harmful.  They should have used biochar & found other ways to mitigate the profound impact on the ocean environment.
2574 2018-04-10 19:52:48 So notley threatens to restrict flow of oil out of Alberta into B.C., but doesn’t want Horgan to be able to restrict the flow out of Alberta into BC.  Hmmmmm

2578 2018-04-10 19:52:06 McCain doesnt GIVE A SHIT about civilians being GASED _ He's mad because Assad doeant give in to US access to Syria Oil & Gas Field and refuse to let SA oil pipeline through to Syria toward Europe's market.

RF, PRC, and IN announce that all assets of NATO/GCC members frozen and export of strategic resources (oil, gas, metals) immediately ceased

2593 2018-04-10 19:50:53 @jred5562 Just watched your HBO Documentary... Excellent.  Numbers were eye opening. .. I work at a coal burner... so, I feel it's the whale oil
2594 2018-04-10 19:50:38 i hope the guy that came actually fixed the oil spill
2595 2018-04-10 19:50:21 Apparently it's not just oil and gas companies that the GOP lets write their own regulations. They literally just asked Zuck to submit his ideas for regulating HIS OWN DAMN COMPANY. In what world is that possibly a good idea?

2600 2018-04-10 19:49:47 No.  This is not a straight "black/white, win/lose" scenario.  CNY is convertible through gold, & convertible through oil profits.  Growing offshore CNY balances should cet par increase CNY bid for gold, which puts upward pressure on gold cet par.
2601 2018-04-10 19:49:43 I heard about avocado oil. Do you have to get it at a health food store?
2602 2018-04-10 19:49:41 Big oil has billions,  they also have the ear of the feds, and tides may have 100s of millions but that is not the amt that opposition has but nice try to make it sound like we have all of tides $. , I donate my time and $ as do 1000's of others quite the opposite of on the take!
2603 2018-04-10 19:49:41 I caught that, too, Joy.  Are they writing regulations while they're in bed together like Minerals Managemt Agency did with oil execs before the BP oil spew in 2010?
2604 2018-04-10 19:49:32 how many billions would a cleanup cost, and who pays? is a cleanup even possible? tough questions to answer for an oil shill I know. and let’s not talk about #fnpoli because that’s a forgone conclusion as well according to you? *rollseyes*
2605 2018-04-10 19:49:27 Haha maybe it is just the oil price today IDK

Once again we are being PLAYED by both sides.
2614 2018-04-10 19:48:35 I haven’t smoked in a LONG while and just took one pull from my friend’s oil pen and I’m kinda like...smacked
2615 2018-04-10 19:48:34 I must have missed the memo that said everyone in the oil patch gets fired when the pipeline doesn't happen.

2618 2018-04-10 19:47:47 Is “oil” one or two syllables?
2619 2018-04-10 19:47:39 Canadians advocating for foreign oil usually are bought and paid for right now. They're not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.

2627 2018-04-10 19:47:01 At least I didn't go out in the qualifiers. Is the electricity company working on the problem so you don't have to rely on the generator and are they going to compensate you for the oil or whatever it runs off

Are you on the take, Terry?

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
2684 2018-04-10 19:41:16 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

2699 2018-04-10 19:40:05 I think we have live oil at the first target and an increase in gas as they drilled deeper into the potential reservoir.

2719 2018-04-10 19:38:09 I don’t need to see footage of destructive effects of palm oil, I try to avoid it all its forms & leave my leaflets that I paid to hv printed on tube and in supermarkets on products containing palm oil, I sponsor Gito through IAR, a tiny victim of palm oil cultivation. 1/2
2720 2018-04-10 19:37:55 I'd rather eating salt and sesame oil for next 45 minutes
2721 2018-04-10 19:37:50 That makes six in the 2005 Gold division! Welcome to Phantoms Orange and Oil Kings Red. See you in May!
2722 2018-04-10 19:37:49 It’s Romaine lettuce, fresh Parm cheese, croutons. Take olive oil and mixed with minced garlic as your dressing. And since you don’t do meat you can do grilled shrimp over top. It’s a quick, easy, and yummy salad.
2723 2018-04-10 19:37:45 Definitely palm oil, topical, massively destructive. Green peace will have loads on it, as will BBC probably as in news today
2724 2018-04-10 19:37:44 You know, they say that smell is one of those most important aspects of memory.  Certain smells can trigger memories.  The smell of leather and jasmine reminds me of my grandfather's wardrobe.  The smell of pepper and hot olive oil?  That of my grandmother teaching me to cook.
2725 2018-04-10 19:37:37 Data is the modern day oil.
2726 2018-04-10 19:37:34 Hatch may think differently about facebook if it revealed how much money he's received by the NRA for his vote against gun control, or how much money he's received from Koch Bros and Big Oil for his vote against climate change. It's time for him to go.
2727 2018-04-10 19:37:32 My great grandfather once testified before Congress... to stop a Texas oil company from selling helium to the Nazis.
2728 2018-04-10 19:37:24 Yes, Orient Petroleum is in Anambra but the oil well belongs to Kogi state and cannot be ceded to Anambra.
2729 2018-04-10 19:37:21 Just like we need scientists or at least people who understand and want to protect the environment heading up the EPA, not an oil man. Or someone who believes in strengthening our public schools leading the Dept of Education, etc, etc!

2732 2018-04-10 19:37:04 By building that pipeline Canada would be breaking our promise made as a nation at the Paris accord to cap emissions, not only violating indigenous rights and putting environment at risk.  We have a huge Oil economy right now, we need to develop other energy resources
2733 2018-04-10 19:36:47 some great stuff about palm oil on BBC news website - looking like a good shout. Thank you :-)
2734 2018-04-10 19:36:44 Clear he sees Facebook as a type of SJ advocacy platform. Primary goal is being a force for good. Arbitration btwn good and bad is question.
2735 2018-04-10 19:36:40 And I said, "Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil, that's blood"
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm, or was he just lost in the flood?
2736 2018-04-10 19:36:27 Worst gearbox ever mate have u changed the oil in the gearbox since having it?
2737 2018-04-10 19:36:26 I woke up in a great mood. Happy payday. Took my car to get an oil change during my break at school #adulting. And found a dime of tree. It’s a GREAT day.

2739 2018-04-10 19:36:13 Germany has been quiet for a reason. They were quiet when Russia shot down the civilian plane over Ukraine. They get half their oil from Russia. They have to be careful.
2740 2018-04-10 19:36:07 Talk about a mixed-message.  I thought their perspective was that oil is icky.
2741 2018-04-10 19:36:00 The desperate attachment to Kinder Morgan - from Texas - by the Liberals (and of course the Conservatives) is sickening! NB: the oil and gas industry accounts for 5% of our national GDP! Enough is enough! We need to protect our land and waters NOW from oil transport!
2742 2018-04-10 19:35:58 Those in oil or mustard? Don't wanna waste a trip.

2750 2018-04-10 19:34:57 Trump’s personal lawyer/fixer, Michael Cohen, who was also the National Deputy Finance Chair for the GOP was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices who are lawyers for Cambridge Analytica and main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company.

2756 2018-04-10 19:34:06 Ehhhh idk whats in that always read the ingredients. But yeah castor oil is good. Most oils are good but make sure it’s nothing but pure oil not a whole bunch of extra shit
2757 2018-04-10 19:34:05 I'd be willing to give them a pass on that actually ... but to blow off the May game at Nippert? At Lucas Oil? Nashville? Ample opportunity to get them on at least once. How do you not showcase your league champs at least one time? Cincy, 4x ... Indy, 3x ... ???

2760 2018-04-10 19:33:55 Go ahead complain about oil as USA sends Alaska Oil Tankers past BC shores daily. They then sell Gas to BC. Even more ridiculous, our only Oil Export customer is USA & 90’/. of Vanc Oil/Gas is piped fr Alberta. BTW your BC Govt just approved LNG Tankers export fr Kitamat terminal

2762 2018-04-10 19:33:50 Plus we killed 1 million Iraqis for the access to oil.  That can't be undone.
2763 2018-04-10 19:33:47 Shell’s global approach to sustainability: dig more to get oil. More cash for investors and 0 damn given to the planet.

2765 2018-04-10 19:33:41 I did think about palm oil and then realised I know naff all about it. Possibly thinking of writing to HT to help us recycle more (less trees need cutting down then?)
2766 2018-04-10 19:33:39 how  else can you send Ab , Sask oil money east so they can buy foreign oil that spends money trying to kill Ab, Sask oil industry ? #isntthiscountrygreat ?

2775 2018-04-10 19:32:58 I tend to use the garnier oil micellar water to remove my makeup, which has been so good and then I tend to use a simple toner and then a moisturiser, can’t remember what it’s called but it’s brilliant around the nose bit

2779 2018-04-10 19:32:42 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

2781 2018-04-10 19:32:29 1) I'm against corporate welfare too, but we need the pipeline and offering loan guarantees and urging the feds to cut BC transfer payments if it continues its obstruction is a good thing
2) we, sadly, have a carbon tax (and the oil sands have been subject to SGER for 12 years)
2782 2018-04-10 19:32:10 We need half time like @TheRock needs baby oil. #LFC
2783 2018-04-10 19:32:02 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=

2787 2018-04-10 19:31:39 the opposition is up against far deeper pockets of big oil and our government

2789 2018-04-10 19:31:37 Yeah look it up its really good for your skin and i put some in a bowl with warm water. And rub it in my skin then rinse my face with cold water and put coconut oil
2790 2018-04-10 19:31:34 What Confederation to me the world is Alberta.  Driving to work yesterday I saw a Canadian Flag and was completely repulsed.  I don't hate Canada I hate Canada back. So be it, we have the oil they don't.  It may be discounted  but we need more pipelines going South.
2791 2018-04-10 19:31:30 $WTI en 65.84 +3.82% en máximos desde Dic 2014. Hay crecimiento de demanda para 2018 en 90.000 bpd y para 2019 en 130.000 bpd. Los arabes quieren al oil en u$s 80. Muy probable extensión d recortes hasta 2019. Las compañias ya muestran buenos balances. El sector petrolero es BUY.
2792 2018-04-10 19:31:28 Seems reasonable...so instead itll be used to prop up dictator, or drill for oil we dont need.
2793 2018-04-10 19:31:20 At last, Maria @SenatorCantwell asks #Zuckerberg the questions that need to be asked: not about @Facebook policy violations, but whether FB employees demonstrated for #CambridgeAnalytica and Russian oil barons how to use US and UK #PII to manipulate elections.

2795 2018-04-10 19:31:10 Just build the dam pipeline and tell BC 2 suck it up. B.C. wants oil and gas 2 heat their homes and run their cars. Their businesses can't function without oil and gas.
2796 2018-04-10 19:31:04 Might be a bit dated but few years ago showed my Y3s the Barbie and Ken advert against Mattel. Also did some good stuff about palm oil which Iceland have just removed from their products so maybe another supermarket?

2799 2018-04-10 19:30:32 We have to take personal responsibility for our waste. Charge ppl for on the front end for future waste and they will conserve.
Create quality products that last a life time .

We need oil but we don’t need to waste it .

2809 2018-04-10 19:29:02 Sealing the asphalt like that will also prevent any oil from getting absorbed when leaked from cars and for those of you on two wheels hold on tightly if it rains.  Slick as ice.  Yet another brilliant Cali idea!
2810 2018-04-10 19:28:54 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
2811 2018-04-10 19:28:38 Absolutely, send that money into renewable energy. Oil companies don't need incentives to drill for oil.
2812 2018-04-10 19:28:30 This container of #freshchurned #peanutbutter got an updated designation.  Did you know you can get gum off paw pads and fur by massaging #pb in it?  The oil from the PB will break down the gum and viola!  Wash paw well with gentle cleanser and rinse. #dogtips #gum

Slide the spatula underneath them to take them out, but just rest it over the pan so the excess oil can drip off
2820 2018-04-10 19:27:33 There is no way back from an oil spill  we are on the verge of putting fossil fuel energy in the past

2853 2018-04-10 19:23:55 I use tea tree oil/soap
2854 2018-04-10 19:23:54 They do contain palm oil, but I guess it depends how you feel about that!
2855 2018-04-10 19:23:51 I GRABBED CHAFING GEL INSTEAD OF MY CUTICLE OIL 
2856 2018-04-10 19:23:45 Anyone who can get straight Rick Simpson Oil...please get in touch.
2857 2018-04-10 19:23:30 put oil on pan, then put 4 eggs, let it cook, then add cheese and let it melt over eggs, and then add salt and etc... enjoy!
2858 2018-04-10 19:23:30 Nothing clears my sinuses like making chili oil
2859 2018-04-10 19:23:28 Wow so the tarte marcuja oil has improved my skin literally over night

2861 2018-04-10 19:23:27 Brent crude #oil prices soared 3.5% to $71.04 a barrel today -- highest settle since late 2014. #OOTT
2862 2018-04-10 19:23:24 @Audi ur service guys knew I was complaining of oil consumption once I started bringing the car in for service now I have no more warranty at all and they could’ve helped with the issue when I called 2 years ago
2863 2018-04-10 19:23:24 my laptop is full of oil paint bc my hands have been constantly full of paint for the past 7 days oops
2864 2018-04-10 19:23:22 Hi Iceland, what happens when people like my sister who is employed by the palm oil industry end up out of work? Could you give a chartered accountant the wage they deserve in your stores?
2865 2018-04-10 19:23:04 Always been a fan of Pekka and really like the Preds roster but the PK angle makes them a slam dunk for me. There is no more misunderstood player in the NHL. Not everyone's cup of tea but the crap many throw his way is ridiculous.

2867 2018-04-10 19:22:43 *Splashing the oil over the top of the egg, watching them cook* I'm not an expert in egg cooking *Chuckling* A minute and a half for perfect runny, check, so now what do I do? It looks okay, maybe ready, maybe not, how do you know? *laughing at the fact I'm a complete novice in>>
2868 2018-04-10 19:22:39 Again you miss the point
If (for example) you replace palm oil with sunflower oil, it takes 5 hectares of land to grow the same amount of sunflower oil as is grown on 1 hectare of palm plantation.
Ergo...the environmental impact is greater
Do you understand this point?
2869 2018-04-10 19:22:39 Just piping in for a second...you can also get a body oil and put it on right after a shower as well.  Less sticky feeling, and it absorbs really quickly.
2870 2018-04-10 19:22:30 I got vetiver essential oil in my hair and now I smell it everywhere and I am very pleased with myself
2871 2018-04-10 19:22:20 Someone needs to feed oil into the ZuckerBot, he's looking a little pale
2872 2018-04-10 19:21:52 Amazing news from @IcelandFoods. Not long after committing to eliminate or drastically reduce plastic packing in its own brand products, they are now stopping the use of palm oil in its products by the end of 2018. #LeadingTheWay. Who's next to follow suit?
2873 2018-04-10 19:21:48 Or maybe $FB is rallying on higher Oil prices?
2874 2018-04-10 19:21:45 Hi Amanda, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.
2875 2018-04-10 19:21:37 Just thinking that reactive response in other industries (I'm thinking chemicals manufacturing, oil & gas) does not get a pass. Deepwater Horizon, as a recent example. #TechHearings
2876 2018-04-10 19:21:36 If Trudeau's Liberals steps up and Ottawa passes a major motion of some sort of #TransMountain, the bullishness potential on Canada oil should reach extreme. Im not holding my breath but I am optimistic.
2877 2018-04-10 19:21:25 Why the use of palm oil is so controversial
2878 2018-04-10 19:21:24 Man City are a shite club..Liverpool have 18 Premier League trophies and 5 UEFA Champions League. What are the odds? Oil money never last good luck LFC #YNWA

2883 2018-04-10 19:21:04 things to consider buying sometime soon:
- complete series of mash
- more to stuff bc my argan oil and lactic acid are running low
- maybe it’s time to finally bite th bullet and get bruce’s second album drunk baby project bc idid find a cheap one 
2884 2018-04-10 19:20:54 Have you checked to see if they’re made with palm oil

2887 2018-04-10 19:20:44 I forgot to put on cuticle oil this morning and honestly my day has been shit ever since
2888 2018-04-10 19:20:39 Brent crude oil logs highest settlement since late 2014
2889 2018-04-10 19:20:38 Not the first time money's been mismanaged/stolen with high prices either. Ofc previous admins aren't blameless but govt.'s job is to fix or mitigate, not pass the buck. Oil prices are largely beyond our govts control anyway but there was/is no plan beyond oil
2890 2018-04-10 19:20:29 I think Kat Von D is oil free. I just haven’t worn it bc I don’t on a daily basis but I also don’t want it that close to me eyelash bc I can’t clean it well and it may not come off good
2891 2018-04-10 19:20:29 Like oil and water.
2892 2018-04-10 19:20:24 I’m guessing most of oil goes to shipping terminal and then shipped to China/Asia/USA/SouthAmerica. Are these customers on board or are shippers breaking contracts ?  Only about 10 % of Alberta oil used in B.C. and they can make that up in offshore oil. Just wondering details...
2893 2018-04-10 19:20:23 Heard so much crap every year and same excuses. They generate electricity by using gas and charging at furnace oil rates. Most expensive electricity bill we Karachites are paying.
2894 2018-04-10 19:20:23 You cannot suck and blow at the same time Kent - you voted against Alberta - time for the voters to kick you out and find someone who cares about people in the oil industry.

2897 2018-04-10 19:19:38 Made my own salad dressing. Olive oil. Garlic sea salt. Pepper. Fresh lemon juice. I'm in love.
2898 2018-04-10 19:19:37 What a wonderful way to spend tax white streets with black cars parked dripping oil so people can slip and fall. Yea a law suit was this thought out by who
2899 2018-04-10 19:19:37 2/2 Similarly I could choose to sell my own home; change my own car oil; and build my own fence. Lots of content online to help me do that. But I choose to pay other people for those services because I think the outcome will ultimately benefit me vs. DIY. If I go DIY it's on me
2900 2018-04-10 19:19:37 Knowing US coalition supporting DAESH how can u trust them at aLL?
Take ur country back, kick them Yankees out they're only there for ur oil/resources

2901 2018-04-10 19:19:34 Equal pay for equal work is a must...However, these studies average ALL careers together.  So should we be surprised when a coal miner earns more than someone working in pet rescue?  Shouldn't an oil rig worker earn more than a kindergarten assistant?
2902 2018-04-10 19:19:28 There is a girl changing the oil in my car at Valvoline and she is a goddess
2903 2018-04-10 19:19:25 First win 3 EPL crowns in a row then come and tell us that we pathetic...... We not winning our trophies thanks to oil money now are we?

You guys are so cocky but can't fill the Eithad
2904 2018-04-10 19:19:21 Throw another tube of grease? In there and call it good. Forget about oil it will just leak out past that bad seal in the shaft bore anyways.
2905 2018-04-10 19:19:19 With all due respect to said season ticket holders, just b/c they aren't happy with the team's results and perceive they are seeing something, doesn't make it fact. If they have that much of an issue w/ it, stop going.
2906 2018-04-10 19:19:14 Oh I remember alright, I think I can still smell the burning *laughs watching you* It’s just the way I cook them, I splash the oil over for a minute and a half and that makes the perfect runny egg. See look how it’s going?
2907 2018-04-10 19:19:13 Q: I’m in renewable energy. Is there something in this budget for this industry?

@DeronBilous: All money trough carbon levy is being reinvested. Different allotments- ag, oil sands, etc. More supports coming.

2913 2018-04-10 19:18:17 The guy doing oil changes gave the car next to me a menu thing and not me, Smh I’m always a second choice

2917 2018-04-10 19:17:50 So you are optimistic & agree with Bob and the Oil braintrust, that a recovery to solid play off team is a slam dunk with current roster & few changes.  And that any other wants/needs are to take it to the final level.
2918 2018-04-10 19:17:45 M X C getting the oil p&d cause its low float, company is a pos, there recent quarterly revenue was 641K. 1 running oil rig in permian has more revs than that in a month, fyi.
2919 2018-04-10 19:17:41 Literally told my mom I was broke until Saturday because I paid my taxes, got an oil change and inspection and am getting my ID redone... her response;

“BUT YOU WENT TO THE SPURS LAST NIGHT.”

 Mexican moms...
2920 2018-04-10 19:17:27 This is very true, and often people do it because its easier to become an essential oil salesperson than other independent selling jobs. It just makes me yearn for universal healthcare all the more.
2921 2018-04-10 19:17:12 I understand. The personally haven't earned what they've got.
2922 2018-04-10 19:17:07 Is there actual science to support this?!? Or did some “green” corporation sell snake oil to the govt in CA?

How much do you want to bet the producer and/or contractor(s) applying this product holds an exclusive patent?? 

Yeah...no possible conflict of interest here...
2923 2018-04-10 19:16:58 I wus pose to go get my oil change but I slept all day
2924 2018-04-10 19:16:50 Currently, our energy resources are not good for the environment or for humans in general. For example, if we continue to use fossil fuels, it could cause climate change, oil spills, bad air quality, and acid rain.
2925 2018-04-10 19:16:49 The yaady in me lowkey wanna get the hot oil
2926 2018-04-10 19:16:41 Heating Oil crushed it today. NG not so much.
2927 2018-04-10 19:16:41 Coal is a wonderful cheap energy source that is falsely maligned by people who don't understand process streams. While green energy and oil& gas are processed upstream where emissions and pollution is ignored coal is processed at ignition point so any comparison is apples&oranges
2928 2018-04-10 19:16:35 Excellent! Argan oil sounds heavenly
2929 2018-04-10 19:16:23 @Bubba_Trading someone forgot to tell oil it has no business climbing over 6% in 48 hours.  #hedged #whattariffs
2930 2018-04-10 19:16:18 what's your plan for cleaning up the oil running off the road into my horse pasture? make my pasture great again.
2931 2018-04-10 19:16:17 I came up with the smartest idea yesterday. We went to Hollywood and parking is always $30+ so we just took the truck to get an oil change instead. Free parking and much needed oil change for a good price.
2932 2018-04-10 19:16:15 Thought I was pretty dumb but then the guy I work with asked if it’s safe to dump oil in the ocean smh

2936 2018-04-10 19:16:00 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2937 2018-04-10 19:15:55 Andrew what would you do differently than Trudeau to guarantee oil from Alberta to BC.  Not blustering statement but straight forward facts.  This is what I would do.....
2938 2018-04-10 19:15:54 Brent crude oil hit $71  today ..... Okay the Syria war thingie
2939 2018-04-10 19:15:45 Who cares where their head office is, they are serving AB oil companies? They want to run a pipeline through BC & our idiot real estate people don't care where money comes from, or what impact is has on BC, as long as it's flowing in our province.
2940 2018-04-10 19:15:43 gold and oil going off oil $70 seems achievable
2941 2018-04-10 19:15:31 Oil demand estimates converging but better data still needed: OPEC: NEW DELHI - Oil demand estimates by major government forecasters are converging, an OPEC official said on Tuesday, although more effort is needed to improve the quality of data about the global market.
2942 2018-04-10 19:15:25 When's the last time you saw a woman working on an oil rig, climbing out of a sewer hole, or working any job that is dangerous or which gets you filthy dirty every day?

If you choose to work clean, indoor jobs with lots of flexibility, you get paid less.

It's just that simple.
2943 2018-04-10 19:15:23 It's because he has now realised that indy *is* coming, and England's pound will crash through the floor without Scotland's oil and Europe's finance. He and his mates *need* Scotland's wealth, and will try anything to keep even a slice of it.

2950 2018-04-10 19:14:14 Can’t drink gas. Can’t eat crude oil. 
Route the pipeline around YOUR house and YOUR water then.
2951 2018-04-10 19:14:03 Thats gonna last a week before its covered in break dust, oil, and other crap that will still absorb heat.
2952 2018-04-10 19:14:00 Not sure what point you are talking about the publicly owned oil company was owned by the government for decades before Chavez was ever elected. There was a lot of corruption and graft attached to it all those years too. Oil in Venezuela is also heavy crude, expensive to refine.
2953 2018-04-10 19:13:57 It's between solidly blazes oil leak/spill and tyraels holy ground (I'm a big fan of 13 talents apparently)
2954 2018-04-10 19:13:56 TIL Facebook thinks I'm a politically moderate frequent traveler with an African-American multicultural affinity & food interests including cognac & motor oil.

2955 2018-04-10 19:13:41 So you have a computer and phone - what are they made of? And you would rather have Saudi oil then Alberta?   And bc is 88 percent dependent on oil and gas and coal - exactly what will replace it immediately and from where ?
2956 2018-04-10 19:13:37 So pleased! It’s a start. Come on @jamieoliver you’ve helped with sugar, let’s reduce palm oil in kids diets. It’s not good for us and it’s not good for the planet. It’s cheap and it is only good for manufacturers profit.
2957 2018-04-10 19:13:34 Wow.  If oil is good for all that, it's pretty stupid to burn it, right?
2958 2018-04-10 19:13:34 It makes me an expert on this subject.

2966 2018-04-10 19:12:34 Yes how does one define sustainable palm oil. The company behind Flora says it uses sustainable palm oil. But again what does that mean. Well done Iceland. The smaller supermarkets like Iceland and Coop usually lead the way before the big ones.

2992 2018-04-10 19:09:35 @keithbaldrey the liberals tough on bc. Why not on
 quebec for not allowing reverse of East pipeline so oil goes to East coast refinery?
2993 2018-04-10 19:09:29 Trying to find information on the supposed oil spill in cannon ball district. 
Found a fundraiser from SRST, still making money off Water Protectors.
2994 2018-04-10 19:09:27 I agree with you ! USA , Russia , China - they all only care about oil/money. The arabs are ponds. I think Iraq maybe turning out OK after some issues inbetween. They tried to create a government of all people before leaving, but ISIS messed it up - not enough security in place
2995 2018-04-10 19:09:27 I support @jjhorgan, and I have family in oil production and live in Alberta.
2996 2018-04-10 19:09:21 Echegaray mantuvo a Oil Combustible fuera de la categoría Grandes Contribuyentes Nacionales porque, convengamos, mucho no contribuía al fisco
2997 2018-04-10 19:09:11 Money from oil is being used to transition? No it’s not. It’s being used in general revenues.
2998 2018-04-10 19:08:46 Day has been tipped off by going to the supermarket for the one thing they don’t have! Then deciding to have something else and getting home and realise I don’t have everything for that either ...and then the oil change light comes on in the car #next #sooverthisday 
2999 2018-04-10 19:08:43 I may have to follow you just so I can unfollow you.
3000 2018-04-10 19:08:29 Steph!! Go back to school!!! Your house is full of cheap Chinese shit, you fill up your vehicle for a $1.25 or so and are happy! Oil and gas investment costs billions, not a one year return, not unlike your mortgage, but creates long term spending and jobs!!! WOW!!
3001 2018-04-10 19:08:13 My favorite thing is when people know who I am from my voice.

(Getting an oil change)

"What's your name?"
"Warren Abrahamson."
(Co-worker leans in)
"You know who that is, right?"
"Of course I do, my son loves your show."

Good feeling. Happy Tuesday, everyone!
3002 2018-04-10 19:08:07 Bro they really try to get you on some other shit when all you need is an oil change 
3003 2018-04-10 19:08:03 Just pointing out the obvious.
 We need oil for everything we do .
3004 2018-04-10 19:07:59 sand, oil, explosions
3005 2018-04-10 19:07:46 He's right.
3006 2018-04-10 19:07:45 Regardless of all that, did you seriously think an expanded pipeline full of bitumen that would then be transported through beautiful Burrard Inlet by large numbers of oil tankers would not attract strong opposition?
3007 2018-04-10 19:07:41 Nothing like dumping a half a tank because pump oil is getting pumped back into the tank. 1 year old sprayer. #realnice
3008 2018-04-10 19:07:40 doing adult things like getting my tire patched and getting my oil changed is giving me super anxiety rn i’m crying
3009 2018-04-10 19:07:37 Mane said sorry to him after that incident but That prick Enderson Showed his true colours there ... And referee Ahhh he's sell out to Oil money
3010 2018-04-10 19:07:13 Labour and Tory governments suppressed the McCrone report, preventing an informed decision ‘79.

And let’s not forget Labours redrawing of the maritime borders.

And if WM is so proud of Oil why only match the SG funding for retraining this downturn?
3011 2018-04-10 19:07:03 Don’t like them but would rather a proper football club goes through than oil team
3012 2018-04-10 19:07:00 just clear canvas for people to tag the streets, going to get dirty fast with oil spills, cars, trash, I live here & I even think It’s stupid, money could go for better that painting streets white they better get ready to re paint a lot

3014 2018-04-10 19:06:43 U took the oil of iraq . U r taking the money and the oil from Saudi Arabia

3015 2018-04-10 19:06:27 Great news. Trying to avoid palm oil is difficult. I hope other supermarkets follow Iceland’s lead.
3016 2018-04-10 19:06:19 - Bio Oil smells like heaven 
3017 2018-04-10 19:06:08 No, people in the US are being played by oil comanies.
3018 2018-04-10 19:06:02 I don't know if he plays that many games a night. Just that he bowls on pro oil patterns and regularly hits 250+

3020 2018-04-10 19:05:53 They’re playing “She Used to Be Mine” at the car center in Walmart and I’m sitting waiting for my oil change to be done and CRYING. Classic.
3021 2018-04-10 19:05:46 We're saying 'no' to palm oil because of the negative impact it is having on the people, animals & environment where its grown. From our visits to Indonesia, we saw the environmental devastation caused by expanding palm oil production; it’s something we feel passionately about.
3022 2018-04-10 19:05:35 
3023 2018-04-10 19:05:18 i know the arguments on oil tankers...but there's a big difference between a well-orchestrated campaign and "big money"....are the three First Nations directly affected influenced by either? Disagree with their point of view, sure, but that doesn't mean it's not heartfelt
3024 2018-04-10 19:05:18 Commodities commodities gold oil.. Ect
There's $GDX in them Hills & $OIL in those fields
3025 2018-04-10 19:05:06 right. Small population, high infrastructure and operating costs, limited oil and mostly agriculture.
3026 2018-04-10 19:04:58 BC has a choice to make. Stop stonewalling on KM & let the oil & gas move or get use to seeing a lot less AB petroleum products moving into BC. Enjoy that $3 a liter that's coming.
3027 2018-04-10 19:04:50 Hate waiting for oil changes 
3028 2018-04-10 19:04:50 I'm not sure what they're talking about, it is nonsense that they claim to not have more money to make water on reserves drinkable, or to build affordable housing, but they want to provide corporate welfare for a Texas oil company. So absolutely maddening
3029 2018-04-10 19:04:39 Steam is really good, also saline spray, Vicks and peppermint oil.
3030 2018-04-10 19:04:39 I've been hash tagging supermarkets for 2years to ban the palm oil, this is a fantastic start Chris :)
3031 2018-04-10 19:04:34 vape oil. Please I must see
3032 2018-04-10 19:04:33 Think of all the industries dragged before Congress: oil, airline, automaker, banks, schools, whatever. None of them have pictures of your family as part of their core business model. That's why this all feels so weird.
3033 2018-04-10 19:04:29 Oil up big today
3034 2018-04-10 19:04:23 USA doesn't buy oil off Syria. In fact, after EU, Syria's biggest trading partner is Iraq which is why I have trouble believing in ISIL as the culprit.
3035 2018-04-10 19:04:21 you will lose that "public Position" with your dirty sand oil ...  screw alberta
3036 2018-04-10 19:04:18 They do like a nosh at the local pub..
3037 2018-04-10 19:04:12 This annoys me too, but I also understand why some people become essential oil sellers. For them, it's a way to still make a little money and be a stay at home parent. I know some who had a lot of health care costs just for giving birth to their kid, and they started selling
3038 2018-04-10 19:04:11 When talking about Somalia look at Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Palestine etc. You didn't utter a word about their palate shame of you.
Gulf states are shameless creators who lost their minds in the oil fields.
3039 2018-04-10 19:04:02 A False Accusation of Chemical Attack Has being Made by Western Invaders For The Sake of Oil and Other Resources, They Want to Kill Millions of Innocent people in Syria As They Did In Iraq They Invade Iraq For Oil But They Told us Weapons of mass destruction Which Was Not Exist

3046 2018-04-10 19:03:27 Would also be good to involve industry expertise with the safety and geomechanical expertise to give due dilgence on the well designs and geological risk Rather odd to see too many standard oil practices being missed
3047 2018-04-10 19:03:19 Time to put that oil to use. I couldn’t even take a 30 min nap just now 
3048 2018-04-10 19:03:05 Not a point to dig into too deeply Rob.  Many many loyal season ticket holders are paying their wages.  And frankly, they are sick of indifference and pouting. #gottabepros
3049 2018-04-10 19:03:01 What kind of oil?!
3050 2018-04-10 19:03:01 Yes. Put some oil in a frying pan. Crack the eggs open. And cook them until the yoke starts to firm up. If the eggs start to burn a little at the edges that’s all the better. 

Best boiled eggs I’ve ever tasted.

3072 2018-04-10 19:01:12 What amazes me bout the rise of ISIS was its rapidity. When they captured oil, I thought bombing the oil fields made sense. Instead, Hobama left them alone.

Then when ISIS refined, who was their cohort? TURKEY. Erdogan's son (in-law?) is il padrone there.
3073 2018-04-10 19:01:12 I just wish my skin would decide what it wants to be. Like my entire face is an oily mess except my chin which is completely dried out from my skin care for my oil. I can't win.
3074 2018-04-10 19:01:05 Said it all year long, the notion that these players didn't try on a nightly basis is not only off-base, it's absurd.

3086 2018-04-10 19:00:26 Guys you can keep on cutting and pasting the same response to his question but you’re missing the point of what’s happened today. Iceland have rejected “sustainable” palm oil as unsustainable which it obviously is. You can chose to do the same

3104 2018-04-10 18:58:16 Have a read of what Iceland’s MD thinks about “sustainable” palm oil. And why he’s today decided it’s not sustainable. There’s no need to use this product. Go further. Remove it totally

3106 2018-04-10 18:58:04 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
3107 2018-04-10 18:58:03 @renegadebrewery gutted you've run out of Snake Oil. Please make some more!
3108 2018-04-10 18:58:00 but climate change has been a BIPARTISAN view up to W Bush-Cheney, it was only turned political by Oil Industry with Cheney. So brainwashing is a stretch on that
3109 2018-04-10 18:57:56 The world is awash in oil. The earth's crust practically floats on it.The real point is being able to sell our stuff!
3110 2018-04-10 18:57:50 If oil is up big on geopolitics then makes you wonder about the rest of the market. So many moving pieces.

3112 2018-04-10 18:57:46 @TomSteyer YOU know the facts. The pipeline would slash energy costs for Americans, facilitate the growth of oil production in the U.S. by increasing access to refineries, generate millions in state and local tax revenues, reduce the amount of oil America imports.

3115 2018-04-10 18:57:36 Nice but a Hydro Flask is not a disposable carrier to be reused instead of bottles or cartons that have to be trashed. Plant a couple of trees anyway for firewood, nice for heating the house on a cold day instead of fuel oil.
3116 2018-04-10 18:57:36 always check your oil before dumping!
3117 2018-04-10 18:57:32 Apologist?? Where? And said we need evidence. Remember Iraq? WMDs. That war destabilised the whole of the Middle East and it turned out there was never any weapons. Whole thing was fabricated for oil. So why not ask for real evidence. Not just accusations. He may have. Or not.
3118 2018-04-10 18:57:30 Me pregunto si Gente Oil es tan de papel como don Fer dice, por que sera que ahora el país esta siendo demandado a nivel internacional? Ya entendieron la.investigación mediocre de Villavicencio? Abran los ojos! El pais esta quedando de hazme reir por tipos como este.
3119 2018-04-10 18:57:29 Well done, I was appalled to find in so many supermarket products palm oil is present in all brands, now there will be a choice. There’s a long way to go with so many products but you’re leading the way with plastic and now this.

3127 2018-04-10 18:56:51 Palm oil plantations destroy rainforests, causing extinction of orangs + precious wildlife. Palm Oil derivatives come from palm oil plantations! Same thing! By purchasing, you're supporting the destruction. I personally cannot justify using any palm oil. The products are gng back

I know it’s impossible what I want
what I’m trying to do
But I can’t give up  
My chest aches so much 
Or maybe it’s all the grease and oil I’m eating leading to a heart attack..

3132 2018-04-10 18:56:16 It is reported the Trump administration is trying to get a rules-roll back so that the oil industry would not be fined for their oil spill!  This is out of step with the needs of society. Oil and gas industry puts profits before fixing their mistakes which harm us.  Nationalize!
3133 2018-04-10 18:56:07 swear! i started going a little bald and now i have little hairs and i’ve been using it for a month now. i use the shea moisturize black castor oil! it smells gross though lol

3135 2018-04-10 18:55:52 Oh cool you're part of the industrial military complex system that bombs civilians and kills innocents for oil, power, and control while displacing refugees but you're "fine" so it's ok... Nah fuck outta here no one cares you a #finefemaleinthemilitary

3149 2018-04-10 18:54:18 THAT's it! Send in the troops, put May in jail! Sheesh! Chill out people!  As soon as Notley ends employment to 40k BC workers dependant on oil as revenue,  as retaliation.....Horgan will blink!

Why do you think that defending the right to own firearms is not the same goal as more people buying firearms?
3157 2018-04-10 18:53:51 To start with yes *laughs* but there won’t be that much oil on them once they are on the plate. Trust me *smiles* Turn the heat up just a little to make the oil warm, then you’re going to crack the egg into the pan.
3158 2018-04-10 18:53:49 My God do you have backwards thinking. "Enemies" First Nations has been fighting this for a long time. We should all be lucky they are standing up to big oil. Unlike you @jkenney who has been and current taking it in ass and asking for more while doing it. #abpoli #ableg

3168 2018-04-10 18:52:55 Please retract these insults. Do you speak to people like this face to face? Why does it make sense to let other countries reap billions as surely the average Asian does not care where they buy their oil ? You do understand that Canada’s loss is Russia’s & US gain in oil supply?
3169 2018-04-10 18:52:53 Dawg idc if my car is on fire , I came here for an oil change ... nothing else fam.
3170 2018-04-10 18:52:34 Anything we can help you with? We stock oil filters for GTI's and ship same day. And they ship for free :)

3172 2018-04-10 18:52:29 Not for money. Not for oil!
3173 2018-04-10 18:52:10 Im not a pacifist far from it however I cant understand why we are wasting out blood and treasure. in fact America would be better off if the entire middle east were to go up in flames.our oil would be worth a mint all we have to do is withdraw our troops and profit.
3174 2018-04-10 18:52:00 I have to go get my oil changed but I hate waiting
3175 2018-04-10 18:51:52 The transition to renewables will only be aided by a strong economy including current energy companies working in Canada. Oil sands are being sold on market .... clearly .... they’re just reaching market inefficiently. Maybe stick to the facts
3176 2018-04-10 18:51:36 Cut the consensus bullshit. There was ONE set of rules, where you think they were good or bad.
Trudeau HAS TWO sets of rules, favouring FOREIGN oil.
Period.
3177 2018-04-10 18:51:28 Being ~responsible~ and getting a dang oil change.
3178 2018-04-10 18:51:24 The oil will just end up entering BC by tanker from countries that don’t have tight environmental policies and likely don’t believe in free speech or human rights. We can turn off all the industry, cars and lights in Canada and have little to no impact on this planet.

3185 2018-04-10 18:50:57 Forgot to turn my electric stove off- used to gas burners- came home to smell of burnt food- then set burner on too high and started an oil fire in my pan. OKAY, I'm going to get this right before I burn this apartment down. I obviously prefer gas stoves! — feeling perplexed
3186 2018-04-10 18:50:57 Mr. Brown, in the geologic view, their claim is valid, because on that scale, oil and coal are renewable resources. Wood burning power plants (chip plants), are powerd by renewable energy as well, as they take about 20 years to replenish. So, they must be burning wood at Apple.
3187 2018-04-10 18:50:51 @Hillingdon some tyre-busting potholes have just recently developed along Sweetcroft lane, off Long lane!! Also, whats with all the slippery oil/diesel at the lights of Sweetcroft/long lane junction?

3189 2018-04-10 18:50:46 They are responding to what we want, before palm oil it was rubber trees. It is consumer driven.
3190 2018-04-10 18:50:46 Whether pro or anti-pipeline, this seems like a failure to listen. In all this, I have never seen a protestor talk about pipeline safety. Concerns seem to be marine safety, tank farm location, Indigenous rights, and meeting climate goals with expanded growth in the oil sands.
3191 2018-04-10 18:50:43 Cual parte la del choreo de subsidios al gas oil o la del choreo de los fondos de Santa Cruz ?
3192 2018-04-10 18:50:40 Actually albertans have an arrogant entitled attitude because of the oil gas industry. It is all about money with that industry.  Trudeau showed a lot of class doing this for Humboldt.  I am an albertan born and raised.
3193 2018-04-10 18:50:21 Morons, in 2 months the roads will be black again. We tried this at work.  Traffic, dirts, oil etc...turns them black. They will have to repaint every few months.

3200 2018-04-10 18:49:35 So... palm oil involves habitat destruction and is "not sustainable." I'll buy that. Where's the outcry over wheat, corn, soybeans, and all annual crops? The havoc they wreak has to be much worse. Habitat, soil, water quality and conservation all harmed.

3213 2018-04-10 18:48:34 Definitely. We need Isis to take overSyria, a secular functioning country with oil and a standing army of 250k soldiers. That will create stability in the region- just look at Iraq and Libya!

3216 2018-04-10 18:48:13 And not a one of those is for painting on a road, which would quickly become very dirty & darker colors from all the oil, dirt&rubber which would necessitate repainting almost monthly wasting millions of $s especially when that’s going for $85 a gallon.
3217 2018-04-10 18:47:57 @realDonaldTrump can you fix these gas prices tired of paying 2.35 for gas. Oil company can afford lowing oil prices and stop the speculators from raising prices.

3237 2018-04-10 18:46:09 Until Iceland can guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction, we are simply saying ‘no to palm oil’. Right now, we don’t believe there is such a thing as 100% ‘sustainable’ palm oil in the mass market. (1/2)
3238 2018-04-10 18:45:56 Thats like the Oil companies being at the forefront of the Climate Change dialogue and driving decarbonisation. If it threatens your business model, then be seen as being proactive about it 
3239 2018-04-10 18:45:49 Yeah I love Oreos but then trying to avoid them because of the bloody palm oil they contain

3258 2018-04-10 18:43:52 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
3259 2018-04-10 18:43:52 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3260 2018-04-10 18:43:51 That isn't an occupy crowd.
3261 2018-04-10 18:43:45 @WoolieWoolz I keep hearing you say "roustabouts" on the podcast, does that mean like "troublemakers" in Canada? I've only ever heard it refer to like, dockworkers or people on an oil rig.
3262 2018-04-10 18:43:45 Need an oil change 
3263 2018-04-10 18:43:41 The problem with current #CBD oil is the lack of bioavailability..
3264 2018-04-10 18:43:37 “We both must burn this midnight oil together. You’re just as new to me as I am you.”
3265 2018-04-10 18:43:37 Got my hair done today, a pedicure, car cleaned out and an oil change. Go me 
3266 2018-04-10 18:43:34 I had a rescue dog that cost me $$$ to clean entire house after he ate economy size bottle of baby oil, destroyed blinds, carpet & others. Created cage under bsmnt stairs & we had a talk. I promised him I wouldn't give him away again. He lasted >dozen years.
3267 2018-04-10 18:43:30 Dude, I didn't say km discovered that pool. I used "they" in the generic sense. As in a huge pool of tight oil was discovered off the coast of Bahrain.
3268 2018-04-10 18:43:29 I am grateful that my vehicle had the needed oil change maintenance when it has been more than 4K miles, headlight bulb replacement as well.#neededtohavethatservicedone#

3270 2018-04-10 18:43:25 Can't believe the plastic flags, the oil money what football has turned into. They don't even know how to make it look real. Martin tyler again. Total bias in commentary. #liv #ucl #MCILIV
3271 2018-04-10 18:43:24 No wonder oil prices are what they are, how many barrels of crude went into making all those flags? #MCFCVLFC #ChampionsLeague #UCL
3272 2018-04-10 18:43:16 The corporate types are getting really worried. They *should* be worried! And they may very well lose their access to BC coastal waters altogether if BC bans all marine gas, oil and coal exports.
3273 2018-04-10 18:43:14 That's silly. @TransMtn is to transport undiluted bitumen not oil used in cars etc. Some facts on the issue would be welcome.
3274 2018-04-10 18:43:14 @bruce_anstey 
Just heard about your heath issues buddy!
You can do it. 
Check out cannabis oil on YouTube. 
We need you
3275 2018-04-10 18:43:11 true shit, john was telling me about the beard oil though, i gotta try that one day
3276 2018-04-10 18:43:11 It doesn’t. They want the gas/oil in Syria...
3277 2018-04-10 18:43:03 Ban Palm oil, bring back the jungle
3278 2018-04-10 18:42:59 *Shaking my head* They're not too bad, you're left to do your job and as long as you do it without giving to much backchat you're norm okay *Handing you the pan that I washed, looking for the oil in the cupboards, eventually finding it and handing it to you* They're >>
3279 2018-04-10 18:42:57 I saw this palm oil business in Costa Rica and I agree% , it’s changing the ecosystem in a bad way.
3280 2018-04-10 18:42:56 Oil gone parabolic
3281 2018-04-10 18:42:44 Promote Solar Power generation and also electric vehicles in India which will reduce oil importation and increase pollution free atmosphere. Solve your problem. Have a nice day.
3282 2018-04-10 18:42:44 Well done - and thank you. First plastics, now palm oil. I'll be doing more of my shopping with you from now on.
3283 2018-04-10 18:42:41 Remember when I spilled literal buckets of boiling oil at amc twice, the first time ruining carpet costing the company thousands of dollars to replace and the second time burning someone's foot and they still didn't fire me
3284 2018-04-10 18:42:40 I'm not suggesting you smoke it. Use of oil as pain relief is no more hindering to cognitive function than ibuprofen. 
3285 2018-04-10 18:42:27 Still can't get over the fact there are actual Oilers fans who think the club should consider bringing back Matt Hendricks in the off-season 
3286 2018-04-10 18:42:20 Playing Beatles in manchester hahahahha What a shit club, no passion, no history, just oil money !
3287 2018-04-10 18:42:18 Other than eye blinking, which can be simulated, I can't distinguish.
3288 2018-04-10 18:42:14 And if the oil royalty revenues do not materialize after 2020-21? The govt is still too reliant on oil revenues to meet its objectives. It could do more on the expenditure side w/out diminished service delivery.
3289 2018-04-10 18:41:57 andddd my next oil change is free 
3290 2018-04-10 18:41:56 @NaughtyByNatur_ Yeesh! Did you get the oil changed yet?
3291 2018-04-10 18:41:54 He’ll transport oil by drone...
3292 2018-04-10 18:41:42 But first need to get some jojoba oil for wood finish. I looked into linseed oil  and the stuff is combustible and toxic to respiratory system. I am more comfortable using jojoba as i used to use it as a massage therapist.
3293 2018-04-10 18:41:39 Ha ha plastic oil flags
3294 2018-04-10 18:41:34 More gold in a whispa more oil in my grandads lawnmower more grain in a cereal bar
3295 2018-04-10 18:41:27 In the 40's when H2s was still in the oil itself  the process hits 20 more levels before it leaves fort mac Raw bitumen has minimal grit but what hits the pipes is nothing like that and extensive sleeving has gone on with the older pipes to ensure fast travel .
3296 2018-04-10 18:41:24 Don't hold your breath for aviation biofuels - I dont have exact quote. but I recall Our Renewable Future cites statistic that all the vegetable oil produced on the planet would only cover 1/3 of aviation fuel (while starving everyone). 1/
3297 2018-04-10 18:41:17 The way our national leaders (both political and business) fawn over the Saudi Crown Prince is disgusting.

We'd all describe him as a petty but ruthless warlord if the Brits had never found oil under the kingdom.
3298 2018-04-10 18:41:03 every day The Donald cries about #CNN being unfair, Jesus whispers #covfefe
3299 2018-04-10 18:41:03 No I’m pointing out the stupidity of allowing public assets to go into the hands of private foreign owned companies.

Every other oil rich country has a national producer that the public profit from, why doesn’t the UK?
3300 2018-04-10 18:41:01 Pink oil all you need my guy
3301 2018-04-10 18:41:00 do y’all use oil diffusers? what’s your favorite oil to put in it?
3302 2018-04-10 18:40:51 The bigger picture is, Putin & Assad are attacking NATO by forcing as many refugees with Jihadist fighters among them to western Europe. Time to get our heads in the game, they haven't been fighting terrorists, they have Hezbullah and Hamas in their ranks and bought oil from ISIS
3303 2018-04-10 18:40:50 Auden asking for me to put coconut oil on him after the bath proves I'm doing SOMETHING right lol 
3304 2018-04-10 18:40:40 If you're a man who conditioners your hair [or know a man who does] what do you use? I can find so few products that aren't heavily marketed at women. I have very dry hair & coconut oil is great but what other products are there??
3305 2018-04-10 18:40:39 Goneka fotgot Nira Radia, oil for food scam some TATA international was involved in it na...
3306 2018-04-10 18:40:28 How dare you.  You should be condemned to live in a parallel universe where only Starbucks exist.
3307 2018-04-10 18:40:25 How are the #oil #Crude shorts doing today?

3310 2018-04-10 18:40:12 It’s cuz they refine the heavy oil (we send) in the states and send it back up to Canada.

3314 2018-04-10 18:40:02 Looks like all they need to do is find a way to seal their ceramic urns
Also, looks like some UK olive oil producers @great_oil  seem to agree with me
But hey, what would experts know? 
Invent your own narrative
Anyway, why is this more important than Brexit undermining the GFA?
3315 2018-04-10 18:39:59 We have also pledged to extend our commitment by converting to certifed palm oil for all relevant non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks. 3/3
3316 2018-04-10 18:39:57 Yes there are quite a few derivatives that can come from palm oil or coconut oil but I guess overproduction of coconut palms must cause problems too but perhaps not affecting quite so many creatures. PHB do say they are POF glad you ordered some products and hope you like them 
3317 2018-04-10 18:39:46 I CAME UP ON SOME SUPER STUPID OIL AND HAVE BEEN REACHING NEW LEVELS OF FADE THE PAST TWO DAYS
3318 2018-04-10 18:39:44 Well luckily for you I don't mass made them, my ingredients are all properly sealed, molds are sanitized so making one without coconut oil isn't  problem at all.

3321 2018-04-10 18:39:39 my dad is driving up from plano to go with me to get my oil changed so i don’t have to sit alone :’)
3322 2018-04-10 18:39:33 I cant wait for the argan oil to do its thing so I can feel cute again but more importantly so I can be that person who walks away w a dangerous ponytail whip
3323 2018-04-10 18:39:32 Fossils fuels are becoming extinct, your desire to invest in the pipeline will run your province dry. You are under lots of pressure, but that’s not worth an oil spill. Your decisions reflect desperation not foresight. #kindermorgan #BC
3324 2018-04-10 18:39:28 (Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil) after making a pledge in 2011. In contrast to our competitors, we do not accept Greenpalm certificates, to ensure that all of the palm oil used in our products is traceable throughout the supply chain. 2/3
3325 2018-04-10 18:39:27 The last line "render them independent of others for essential, particularly military , supplies" is all inclusive. Can you imagine if we were beholden to China for all food, or Russia for all oil?

3327 2018-04-10 18:39:12 Brent oil ,$80 Its not just manipulation...Kindly read news about possible US action on Syria chemical attack....High level tension between US n Russia....
3328 2018-04-10 18:39:11 fake news....Assad didnt gas his own people...this is all about oil, petro dollar and the greater israel project...get a clue
3329 2018-04-10 18:39:10 Hi Abigail. As a responsible retailer we have met our commitment to exclusively use certified sustainable palm oil for all of our food products. We have completed an extensive programme of moving all of the palm oil in our own-label food products to RSPO certified oil 1/3
3330 2018-04-10 18:39:07 Where can I lodge a complaint about having to read the phrase “CBD coconut oil”?
3331 2018-04-10 18:39:01 If you ever fancy fish and chips but wanna be semi-health, do this:
Slice sweet potato. Cover in coconut oil and paprika.
Put on baking tray with a piece of breaded fish. Bake for 30mins.
Add half a tin of mushy peas. 
It’s my weekly go-to and it’s DELISH
3332 2018-04-10 18:38:59 Trudeau and Butts are anti oil. They are to blame.
3333 2018-04-10 18:38:53 For soup, cook ground shallots in oil, then simmer with turkey, herbs de Provence, vegetable broth and tomatoes. Top with orzo.
3334 2018-04-10 18:38:49 Did you oil your suit, looks shinier than usual
3335 2018-04-10 18:38:40 My oil thick like chocolate pudding
3336 2018-04-10 18:38:34 Many don't work any day. Occupy spent weeks camped out. Marginal fringe groups are not majority as 2016 proved. Overcame blue dots on map
3337 2018-04-10 18:38:31 U got it let it breathe man that will dry out your beard quick ... use the beard oil that shit does wonders make it softer and look so much better
3338 2018-04-10 18:38:20 Al pueblo no le incumbe que Oil quiebre y menos aún cómo van a conseguir el dinero que nos deben y han robado de forma ingeniosa y con el aval de la AFIP. Debe investigarse a todos los familiares, amigos,y demás que guardan información sobre esos fondos.Exigimos lo devuelvan.
3339 2018-04-10 18:38:16 He has. Get rid of the oil subsidies, walstreet/bank subsidies,shell company loop holes,  MILITARY SPENDING...
Invest in education, infrastructure, and healthcare. We are gonna lose the next generation fight to world powers like China going green by 2050/Green manufacturing.
3340 2018-04-10 18:38:13 Oil change.
3341 2018-04-10 18:38:04 so we will be doing some searching. We need oil and that pan you just washed.
3342 2018-04-10 18:37:58 yes, an agreement was reached...but  her point remains...obviously, there is disagreement over how much risk remains...agree or disagree with KM, for people who live here, the thought of all those oil tankers is unsettling, to put it mildly....
3343 2018-04-10 18:37:55 No milk added, just water and oil to the Orgran mix.
3344 2018-04-10 18:37:42 Yes, wise move . The Black is like stainless steel - always see smudges / fingerprints . I’m going to get my wood lacquered soon ... should oil but can’t be doing with maintenance .
3345 2018-04-10 18:37:28 Hi Amber, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.
3346 2018-04-10 18:37:25 I did like your clever crap comment! Problem ...Canada  is broke and the USA is and will with the two other pipelines going south sell trillions of litres our oil at a profit. Too many folks like you don’t see the whole picture. Sad
3347 2018-04-10 18:37:24 Is codliver oil recreational?
3348 2018-04-10 18:37:22 To far for me, I’m oil all the way if
3349 2018-04-10 18:37:20 If its up to me to do my daughter hair she's gonna be going to school with a big fro full of oil sheen and one of them headbands the girls wear to hide their big foreheads
3350 2018-04-10 18:37:17 Government signs US$ 4.2bn contract with Albertine Graben Refinery Consortium (including General Electric) to build oil refinery!! Someone share the term sheets of the financing agreement?
3351 2018-04-10 18:37:13 pavement cars generally run them out the right side of the steering gear. offset, along with some cars running an oil tank in front of the left rear like a midget.
3352 2018-04-10 18:37:08 The march has to go on there are few other alternatives. The people of the world have to become aware of the brinkmanship of politicians bought by gas, oil & coal. The dinosaur are short-sighted and to want
to win time detrimental to the people's of this earth.

3354 2018-04-10 18:36:53 Hahaha just have to take your oil 
3355 2018-04-10 18:36:50 I'll stand in the way of the Totino's pizza roll to protect the bottle of olive oil!
3356 2018-04-10 18:36:42 And what about Rex Murphy and Peter Mansbridge being paid directly by big oil lobby groups?

3359 2018-04-10 18:36:34 i put coconut oil in my hair n now my hair smells like latik
3360 2018-04-10 18:36:34 The Assad regime bought ISIS oil. It’s well documented. Keep backing dictators and repressive regime’s. It’s not going to stop any wars or make humanity any more free.
3361 2018-04-10 18:36:33 I wd believe the story of gas resources or at least blocking transite pipe story as more real than war for oil. Block 9 story shows that nobody treated this topic seriously even before 2011. Before it US companies had concessions at most SE Syria. Nothing more.
3362 2018-04-10 18:36:31 Just because it looks clear, does it mean it's clean? I look to the right from Kaneo and all I see is brown stuff entering the lake. I walk along the promenade and Memo Beach and I c more trash than u could pack into 3 giant bags including motor oil bottles.that only on MK side..
3363 2018-04-10 18:36:07 Actual human lives are at risk when "mobile" oil tankers barrel through small towns. Lives have been lost. Lac-Megantic practically destroyed, at least 42 lives lost.   But the ducks!
3364 2018-04-10 18:36:01 @Thinkersact Then u have mistaken me! I guarantee I've been seeing it longer then you have! And u r right in electric makes oil cheaper, BUT battery technology is still way behind and if we investigate every old cars could do better the any hybrid!
3365 2018-04-10 18:36:00 Somalia stand with emarat when they were poor and did not get oil if they did to day so doesn't make sense, but Emarat cross the limit and they wanna destroy our country like yemen,syria lipya, I know you arab countries are behind to destroy your arab brother leave us alone.

havnt seen them for so long
3367 2018-04-10 18:35:40 And what about Rex Murphy and Peter Mansbridge being paid directly by big oil lobby groups?
3368 2018-04-10 18:35:35 These pipelines are for selling oil to the most polluting, cheap plastic making country, so they can inturn sell it to us & finally use our $& natural resources so they can buy our homes & businesses. Canada is in trouble because of foreign interest & politician who sell us out
3369 2018-04-10 18:35:32 I bought it from Whole Foods. But I usually cook them in a pan with oil, salt, pepper, garlic and sometimes onions
3370 2018-04-10 18:35:31 You are in danger of becoming irrelevant. Supporting Snake Oil Pruitt is a bridge too far. Vain to deny it!

3378 2018-04-10 18:35:09 The #KMPipeline is for pumping oil to #China. How is that in the best natl'l interests of #Canada? Stand up to #Texas aka #Alberta and say NO.  British Columbia's wealth is in the #Environment #Coast #Fishing #Tourism there is NO place for a pipeline here. Don't support #Texas
3379 2018-04-10 18:34:56 damn i shampoo mine everyday, but never use oil
3380 2018-04-10 18:34:50 Problem ...Canada  is broke and the USA is and will with the two other pipelines going south sell trillions of litres our oil at a profit. Too many folks like you don’t see the whole picture. Sad
3381 2018-04-10 18:34:47 2- then every academic discussion about coal, oil & gas effect on climate change must also include pre-industrial age global fluctuations, solar flares, livestock and fertilizer.  Or maybe we should avoid the whole subject so people in coal industry don't feel lesser?
3382 2018-04-10 18:34:37 Including ur lineage. Somebody shld cum and change d oil in dis guy @EKOLOEI brain. Its black already.
3383 2018-04-10 18:34:25 Absolutely right! Two wars on false pretenses and we’re paying through the nose to fund the military. Trump wants to rebuild it. That’s downright stupid. Modernizing weapons systems is a must, but wars to control the middle easts oil is wrong.
3384 2018-04-10 18:34:09 @silkdynastystx @AdamMancini4 your thoughts on $OIL here? $DWT
3385 2018-04-10 18:34:08 @JeffCooperLive Jeff ... What is your view on oil? Are we in a sustained uptrend here? Will appreciate it immensely if u can post your thoughts. Thx.

3390 2018-04-10 18:33:46 I am a New Yorker, no one knows trump like a New Yorker. He is a snake oil salesman, a liar, a con. You may not believe me. Hell, everyone knows who has dealt with him. I have seen racism, corruption, illegal dealings that stretch into the 80's
3391 2018-04-10 18:33:44 Guys... they don’t have bidets in this country, how do these guys shit? Y’all lube your asses with oil prior? Am I missing something? This isn’t revolutionary.
3392 2018-04-10 18:33:43 Naw bro i do it 3-4 days out the week i wash it daily but shampoo not all the time and i use the oil 4-5 days out the week

3394 2018-04-10 18:33:14 I've always wondered if they use oil to make actors look super sweaty. It'd last forever

3396 2018-04-10 18:32:58 Retired US general just been on Skynews. Said that 'they' (asaad and putin) are just looking for an opportunity to attack Israel. Please God we aren't being drawn into ww3 to protect Israel and it's rumoured claim to oil in the Golan Heights

3398 2018-04-10 18:32:55 Iran? Learn your history. The US overthrew a Democratically elected leader of their government in 1953 because they didn’t want to continue to allow Britain to take all their oil for pennies on the dollar. How did the overthrow work out in Iraq and Libya?
3399 2018-04-10 18:32:54 looks like olive oil, needs to find popeye and smaller bra.
3400 2018-04-10 18:32:54 Delighted at this partnership. Well done Gino & Iceland! I don't use palm oil. I stopped when it disagreed with me.. I hope other food shops & manufacturers follow suit....

3402 2018-04-10 18:32:47 You're telling me the UK government is giving aid to the Syrian government while funding & arming proxy terrorist armies to take control of Syria. I think you mean well, so research how "aid money" is used to support regime change. See who bought ISIS Oil from Syria. £Billions.

3405 2018-04-10 18:32:31 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
3406 2018-04-10 18:32:23 It is such a funny post!! Cannot stop laughing! Oil company, sustainability! 
3407 2018-04-10 18:32:21 The conservative voters of Alberta are not inclined to blame the conservative governments for the difficulties they face due to the fall in oil prices, but they are mad as hell at Notley and the NDP for the situation that the conservative parties left behind. It's not logical.
3408 2018-04-10 18:32:19 16 year olds put here doing birthday shoots in swimming trunks all rubbed down with oil.
Can't be Nigerian.
3409 2018-04-10 18:32:12 Agreed. & Alberta produced a lot of oil, when the price went down oil companies temporarily shut down and didn't care about Alberta's economy.
How is Alberta almost broke after all the oil they produced? Because these companies don't care about Canada Canadians. They dont
3410 2018-04-10 18:32:06 The three panhandle counties of MD should defect to West Virginia. Everyone would be happier and it would make it easier to avoid Communism on road trips.
3411 2018-04-10 18:32:02 Merit is no more. Equality is nothing more than perception when it comes to people. Even if all things ARE equal - liberals will scream otherwise.
3412 2018-04-10 18:31:57 Shea butter and almond oil have been my life saver. I also put on a lil oil before I get out the shower and dry off. Helps lock in the moisture my skin act like it doesn’t want.

3453 2018-04-10 18:28:26 We both know who owns the largest US refinery on the Gulf coast. A tariff on exports to fuel sent to BC would effectively make it pretty clear where their oil comes from. The suggestion of wine is ridiculous. If they can block our trade why can't we add a tax?
3454 2018-04-10 18:28:21 They have no clue as to do they are going to do.  But they were quick to deal with the auto sector and aero space industry.  It pains me that most people don’t get it... federal money (transfer payments) come from the oil industry which is Alberta

3457 2018-04-10 18:28:05 That same area included the stolen land where the Dakota Access pipeline was built the past couple years. Another irony is that residents of Bismarck didn't want the danger of an oil pipeline destroying their muni water system. It was okay to move it to Standing Rock, however.

3470 2018-04-10 18:26:52 Not exactly because CAD is driven by oil, and oil is being stupid today and climbing for no reason. Hopefully data later today shows we have a surplus of oil so CAD can stop the bullsh** today for a bit.

3476 2018-04-10 18:26:24 well, these issues are complicated by the fact that avoiding "real economic consequences" means increasing the number of oil tankers in Burrard Inlet by seven...those aren't oil tankers in land-locked Alberta...

3500 2018-04-10 18:24:36 They're in a discussion about palm oil. I'm not sure they'd like this 
3501 2018-04-10 18:24:29 And the reason is because the foreign owners of the Alberta gas & oil industry don't want to make Alberta that independent of them. The feudal servitude continues.

3521 2018-04-10 18:21:53 the attack is on. It is all over media. Smearing, Vilifying. Just like UK media does with Jeremy Corbyn. Sickening. It just shows what a sway big oil has over BC/Cdn media.
3522 2018-04-10 18:21:32 It's called See No Evil. It's mostly about how the CIA fell into a malaise after the end of the cold war and how the switch from a focus on field assets to digital intelligence gathering limited their capacity and left door open to outside corruption from foreign oil interests
3523 2018-04-10 18:21:27 Alberta could always look at creating jobs for Albertans by refining oil in their own province and bypassing the whole diluted bitumen issue. But no. #BigOil #abpoli #KinderMorgan #TransMountain
3524 2018-04-10 18:21:23 Does anyone have a good recipe for brussel sprouts? I usually just roast them with olive oil, salt and pepper but I want to do something different 
3525 2018-04-10 18:21:14 That’s refreshing. I agree with you on both counts. Facebook advertising is iffy at best, i’m equally skeptical of Adwords, at least in terms of being competitive with a brand that has near limitless ad budgets. 
SEO has its place but there are tons of snake oil scams out there.
3526 2018-04-10 18:21:14 You mean like subsides for oil exploration when oil company profits are in the 100's of billions
3527 2018-04-10 18:21:13 @TunnockOfficial please stop using palm oil in your products .. it was never in the original

3530 2018-04-10 18:20:47 We can, but Oilsands work & pipelines are not "good" jobs. They're destructive, divisive & truly profit a few while accelerating Climate Change. Give up pipelines & save oil workers by diversifying/retraining to sustainable energy. Alberta could be #1 in sustainable energy.

I decided to leave out mental illness stuff for now and make this one a focus on physical disability. That was a tough call.

3534 2018-04-10 18:20:29 I have an appt with my gp to get my depression meds adjusted in, about an hour. I was going to go drain oil but I’m like, high key anxiety instead.

3540 2018-04-10 18:19:47 My client needed to come to Walmart. I needed to go there for an oil change. So currently I am killing two birds with one stone and getting paid for alla it 
3541 2018-04-10 18:19:47 It’s sticky so u just rub oil in and the hot towel helps the oil go thru your body

3543 2018-04-10 18:19:28 Enrique you should look into bulletproof oil that you can add to shakes, tea, coffee or even water. It gives you energy without the crash. Mark and I really like to have some before our runs or a big exam.
3544 2018-04-10 18:19:26 I woke up, paid some bills, went to the gym and got my oil changed. Now on my way to grab a salad. This is the most adult I’ll ever feel.

3555 2018-04-10 18:18:49 Oil production is at record high levels, two pipelines under construction, two more have been approved

Tell me again how the industry is under attack?
3556 2018-04-10 18:18:48 And this comment perfectly proves my point... Nate says Toews contact all of a sudden has become bad. Strictly after they don’t make the playoffs.  If the Oil weren’t going to pay Looch, someone else would.   Contract = Market value and at the time that was market value .

3568 2018-04-10 18:17:06 Well done Iceland!!  My class of Year 3/4 kids, who learnt about the rainforests last term, will be thrilled to hear this!  They were quite upset about palm oil and the destruction it causes!
3569 2018-04-10 18:16:56 If you really wanted to save the environment, release the patents on "free energy devices." The technology DOES exist. As long as government can profit from oil lobbying and carbon taxes, it will be impossible to take the next step needed to free humanity and heal the planet.
3570 2018-04-10 18:16:49 My mind is BLOWN! Thank you @Jenna_Marbles and @juliensolomita for introducing me to Coconut Oil! I just sautéed some leeks and mushrooms to garnish my Vermicelli and OMG! SO GOOOOOOOOOD!!! THANK YOU #J&J’sKitchen!!!

3575 2018-04-10 18:16:30 Well, they're trying to keep an oil industry here in spite of the fact that professionals don't want to move here because the quality of our education system ranks around 42nd or 43rd in the nation. Now, they want future employers to pay more for that less than mediocre result.
3576 2018-04-10 18:16:28 Response from @waitrose “With regard to palm oil this is a complex issue which balances a number of environmental and social considerations. Using alternatives to sustainable palm oil won't necessarily result in the best outcomes for society or the environment.” 
3577 2018-04-10 18:16:23 If May/Trump cared about children 'needlessly dying', why sell bombs, fighter planes to Saudi, who are slaughtering children daily in Yemen?
I reckon it's about regime change. No other explanation. Getting rid of Assad, opens the way for US/Saudi gas/oil pipeline through Syria?
3578 2018-04-10 18:16:22 There is no good reason for gas prices to increase in Ontario we have an over abundance of oil and no shortage of refinery sites. WE ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF !!!
3579 2018-04-10 18:16:03 You're comparing 5 oil tankers being loaded each month, to the 40 they're planning after the Westridge expansion. That's not only a significant increase in oil tankers, that's an increase in overall traffic out of Burrard Inlet. The pipeline doesn't go to Asia!
3580 2018-04-10 18:16:02 As quoted from a #FakeNews opinion post that clearly blames big oil?

Side note - climate change has ALWAYS existed, even "scientists" acknowledge that, but to say that man is the ONLY cause, well that's literally a lie, unless sporadic campfires during the Roman Empire count...
3581 2018-04-10 18:16:00 Awe, thank you.  I prefer natural remedies so I will for sure.  Just this week two women have mentioned, off the cuff, peppermint oil works!

3588 2018-04-10 18:15:33 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world

3627 2018-04-10 18:11:39 No, the environment in Canada is mostly pristine flourishing nature. Furthermore, our country removes more CO2 from the atmosphere than it releases, thanks to our low population vs gigantic land & forests. So there is no moral problem with the massive extraction of our oil.

3636 2018-04-10 18:11:00 I like the natural gas stuff, but you guys are going to be way off on your oil forecast. No way we we go down on days of supply through this year. Exports and High runs will trump increased production by far.
3637 2018-04-10 18:10:56 The #US has a single plan in #Syria:
To disintegrate Syria and settled in the wealth of water, oil and agricultural products.
So to control the ideological limit of #Israel, the #Euphrates.
Only the idiots do not understand that. #Trump #Macron
3638 2018-04-10 18:10:50 They’re fighting for the OIL... as always they can never say what they really want...if in Syria there were bananas, they weren’t be there.
3639 2018-04-10 18:10:48 We should pigeonhole ourselves to a market that we have zero control over, to produce expensive oil with diminishing returns. Clowns and morons all of them. People forcing change because otherwise we will never. You sound like a child that doesn't want to eat his vegetables.

3648 2018-04-10 18:10:02 So do we. Where do you think AQ/ISIS got their funding and weapons from? Why do you think the Arab Spring happened? We started a revolution then backed out when our voters wouldn't accept another Iraq war. We destroyed Syria in the name of "democracy". It was about oil and gas.
3649 2018-04-10 18:10:02 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
3650 2018-04-10 18:10:00 Lets also not forget that during the early opposition to KeystoneXL, Steyer had an interest in a competing pipeline (Trans-Mountain pipeline) that would have carried tar sands oil to Canada's Pacific coast for ocean shipment.

3657 2018-04-10 18:09:19 No, but we might then seriously look beyond expansion of the Oil and Gas industry for other sources of revenue and other industries for job creation. We need to stop putting all our eggs in the O&G basket hoping of another boom and then being shocked at the inevitable bust
3658 2018-04-10 18:09:09 Oil is not the ultimate win. I agree. Its just the route. I actually have some idea in mind which your scientific mind would not approve.

3666 2018-04-10 18:08:46 Sigh. I know.

I'm not at all happy about it but I know he will and I know why.

Partly this is Harper's fault for making Albertan oil sands so important to the Canadian economy and making Keystone XL a thing.
3667 2018-04-10 18:08:42 PS I’m still registered republican and worked in Middle Eastern oil fields, so I’m really not THAT much of a leftist... just interested in rooting out corruption.
3668 2018-04-10 18:08:40 Poor comparison. The benefits of fossil fuels far outweigh the harm they cause, which was never the case with asbestos. It’s unacceptable that we import foreign oil, while leaving our own oil in the ground.
3669 2018-04-10 18:08:17 Really? Privatizing the V.A. so your inner sanctum of billionaires can rip it off like they have with the private prison system, does NOT sound like “unwavering commitment”. It sounds like the usual snake oil BS you’re always peddling to America. We ALL KNOW it’s just more LIES!

3672 2018-04-10 18:07:48 It's really because war is the biggest most profitable business in the world. Weapons, oil, and drugs all move a lot of money around, and the media gets a cut too, unless you have conscience like Phil Donahue or Bernie Sanders.

3674 2018-04-10 18:07:43 The new wave for me is doing conditioning treatments and leaving them in for a day then showering, putting coconut oil/leave in conditioner/ or another mask in my hair, putting it in braids or a bun, laying my baby hairs and repeating everyday. I love a routine

3676 2018-04-10 18:07:15 Okay. Targeted ads are getting even scarier, like twice removed. Getting my oil changed today, that’s in my calendar, usually while waiting I wander around JcPenney’s because it’s next door. Just put on Spotify...Penney’s ads! I have said nothing about JcPenney’s recently...
3677 2018-04-10 18:07:11 Trudeau does not want pipelines and notley is only making noise to keep her job they both side with BC and neither of them care what happens to our oil !
3678 2018-04-10 18:07:09 But again by that standard, you can take no action. The tankers are already in the inlet. That risk is already there. The pipeline is about getting the oil there as efficiently and safely as possible.
3679 2018-04-10 18:07:07 It will close up as the oil price creeps back and the general activity brings in more tax but I feel it will never generate a surplus. All I hope for is very low extraction taxes to keep people in jobs and bide time for new technology and service industries.

3689 2018-04-10 18:06:25 Dear Jimmy, DAPL is not Keystone nor tar sands. It is crude oil from ND Bakken crude oil field. Keystone or Enbridge is fracked from Alberta oil shale or tar sands. Just thought it should be cleared up. I have fought them both. Keep it up.

3691 2018-04-10 18:06:17 Getting $23 less than market for a barrel of oil is bad for business. Trans mountain would allow us to sell at the world average price, that’s good for business. Right now the people who are doing good at business are the ones buying our oil at a discount and then reselling it.

3694 2018-04-10 18:05:59 Small club with oil money. That is all.
3695 2018-04-10 18:05:55 "Can't we all just get along?" 

Nope! The Son of God even said you'd be hated for His name sake. The righteous will always be despised by the unrighteous. It's like water and oil, they don't mix.
3696 2018-04-10 18:05:55 Great news! It is almost impossible to buy certain foods due to the use of Palm Oil. Try finding a digestive biscuit without palm oil! @McVities & even @hovisbakery have palm oil in theirs! Ludicrous! Plus most of the top brands and supermarkets put it into theirs....Grrrr!

3706 2018-04-10 18:05:15 China has too mich trade and too cunning to get involved military. Plus they can capitalise more on a weaker RU and drive down oil prices in Serbia. Easier to manipulate a desparate salesman.

3708 2018-04-10 18:05:13 Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil, there’s no debating that. The numbers show that, it still doesn’t erase the chances of it happening.

Oil is traded in yuan ccy.
3713 2018-04-10 18:04:45 That is an oil company. We were talking about grades of crudes. CPC is a grade from Kazahkstan

They make big claims about being Palm Oil free but unless I'm seriously mistaken, this appears not to be the case. :( I've written to them + await their response.
3715 2018-04-10 18:04:32 So u would rather Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and syria supply our oil then?

3718 2018-04-10 18:04:15 Soviet has been trying since the onset of cold war! Ffs that effort was actually what we call a Cold war and it didn't turn out well for them by any margin.

You all just after Syria oil and gas reserves!
3729 2018-04-10 18:02:57 No but it promotes governments working together to be efficient. Again you can want to fight climate change but also support the pipeline. Trump is being more and more protectionist. more than 90% of the oil is shipped to the states. If he decides to lock us out. We are screwed
3730 2018-04-10 18:02:57 “Adorable” is that what we’re calling it now?
3731 2018-04-10 18:02:50 Hope all my farmin family and friends be careful hustling burning the midnight oil gettin planted!

3733 2018-04-10 18:02:35 OIL DIFF: 5.74 -> 5.87
3734 2018-04-10 18:02:34 Yet you would prefer it takes a rail line along the Fraser valley? That is ok but not far more environmentally friendly, safer, efficient pipelines. That would make you hypocritical AF. If you were actually making a stance then you need to stop accepting oil by rail as well.

3776 2018-04-10 17:59:54 Things in Canada must always change...? Always someone like you crying over something that needs to be changed, like Canada is so horrible because of the oil?? Now Canada is the worst place to be in for ALL companies. Time to do like Mr Gwyn Morgan said, create a national guard..
3777 2018-04-10 17:59:54 Of course Canadians are concerned about climate change. But that doesn't mean they oppose the pipeline. With that logic no one would have a gas car right now. Pipelines are by far the most efficient way to transport the oil. Unless you want 100s of tanker trucks instead.
3778 2018-04-10 17:59:46 I got my oil changed today, sorry gay community im masc now 
3779 2018-04-10 17:59:41 BC Liberal MLA @Mike_de_Jong says in the absence of more pipeline capacity, BC will see dramatic increase in "riskier" rail transport of crude oil.
3780 2018-04-10 17:59:41 It's @Mike_de_Jong now. Says oil by rail shipments are increasing. Wants to know what steps gov is taking to protect province from that increase "that virtually every study you read confirms is riskier" than pipeline transport #bcpoli
3781 2018-04-10 17:59:39 been mixing Jojoba oil with my face lotion & my face has never looked or felt so good. I’m so sad I been sleeping on it for this long 
3782 2018-04-10 17:59:35 I still don't understand what the objective is. Are they hoping someone says they can have all the oil if they stop killing kids?
3783 2018-04-10 17:59:27 So Iceland does what #RealBread bakers always have, and aims to remove Palm Oil from its produce,
will industrial bakeries follow?
3784 2018-04-10 17:59:23 #CJP_ActionAgainstKE KElectric is not using Bin Qasim 1320MW Furnace Oil power plant to fill power shortfall and instead use cheap tactics and blamed SSGC. Lets join hands and sell KElectric Stocks to punish them.
3785 2018-04-10 17:59:11 Maybe baby oil or coconut oil???   Heat up the dryer for a minute or two then try the oil? All I got

3789 2018-04-10 17:58:59 I wonder which is healthier, puffed rice (fried in oil) or popcorn
3790 2018-04-10 17:58:53 Problem is you are not comparing apples to apples with crude oil. some refineries buy one crude others another because of configuration. A refinery buys the heavy crude first/then the light crude. it is not a choice between all crudes.That is where price discovery theory is wrong

3797 2018-04-10 17:58:12 Services & goods cost more to deliver to remote dispersed populations. If it's a union it's right the union pays to deliver essential services equally. Look to Norway to see how to cope with oil price fluctuations. UK did things differently (badly).

3799 2018-04-10 17:57:56 Make sure to push that snake oil salesmen @davidgokhshtein out of the game as well. @philakonecrypto is pretty terrible too with his rape threats.
3800 2018-04-10 17:57:53 Supermacy in world is not maintained by controlling oil. Russia and Saudi have immense oil and they are far from wielding the kind of power US wields. Once again, oil was never a reason and will never be. 

And it's pretty obvious to understand the impact of creating a mess.

3802 2018-04-10 17:57:36 QP all about KM pipeline today. Libs raise possibility of increased oil-by-rail shipments, increased truck inspections at Alberta border, economic mayhem. Govt. downplays all concerns. #bcpoli
3803 2018-04-10 17:57:36 But they aren't cold...'a cold dish of various mixtures of raw or cooked vegetables, usually seasoned with oil, vinegar, or other dressing and sometimes accompanied by meat, fish, or other ingredients.'
3804 2018-04-10 17:57:28 yep, they wanted me to pay £160 for an oil change lmao..
3805 2018-04-10 17:57:24 As for Scotland, the main point of "Project Fear" in the Scottish independence referendum was that Scotland wasn't as self-sufficient as it thought it was (based on oil revenue). That turned out not to be true because the cost of oil dropped by over two thirds.
3806 2018-04-10 17:57:10 Oil-by-rail versus pipeline is now being raised by BC Liberal Laurie Throness  in QP. Premier @jjhorgan says his government wants to look at all oil transport, whether by rail or pipeline.

3827 2018-04-10 17:55:42 @nytimes Thursday March 29, good story Business page 1 on Windpower. Define "Green Energy"... wind, solar PV, solar thermal, wave & tidal. That's about it! Bad fuels in order DOWNWARD: Coal, oil (s/b used as raw material to petrochemicals), nuclear, natural gas, big-dam hydro.

I believe their efforts have had a lot of bearing from regional states' actions. They need to remain here for a long time cuz this mess isn't getting over anytime soon.
3836 2018-04-10 17:54:52 So you don't buy the theory that this is about a Qatari pipeline to end European dependence on Russian oil?
3837 2018-04-10 17:54:51 @UmaruSanda I doubt if anything serious will come out from the so-called investigation by EOCO regarding the collapse of UT and capital banks. Once BOST oil contamination, NLA, Masloc homeused panda  etc have all not been attended to by this govt. #CitiNewsroom
3838 2018-04-10 17:54:41 Some think it's America, but i'm inclined to believe it's the oil capital of the middle East. For America wasn't the nation state it is back when the prophecies were a thing, and like other countries America was lured in by the oil market.

Throw a little salt on it also, That is really good.

3894 2018-04-10 17:48:45 It is already included in the calcs we have now and it does not cover our spending. The sum of all taxes including oil falls short by a long way.
3895 2018-04-10 17:48:39 Getting an oil change. There are two leather couches. One was empty while I was filling out paperwork. The woman who was sitting with her daughter in one moved to the center of the other and had her daughter lay down on the first. Wtf?

3898 2018-04-10 17:48:13 Yes, building pipelines and protecting the environment ARE competing priorities. Building pipelines creates infrastructure which becomes a rationale for shipping more oil through pipelines. This is at odds with reducing the burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions
3899 2018-04-10 17:47:56 Are the wrappers recyclable and do they contain palm oil (whether so-called 'sustainable' or otherwise)?
3900 2018-04-10 17:47:53 Reminder:

My query was specifically about Vehicles/oil imports.
3904 2018-04-10 17:47:21 Totally agree and meanwhile the hard working people of oil and gas and agriculture get punished. Agriculture as rail links are clogged. These are the rank and file of @BucklesandBulls and we will fight for our people.
3905 2018-04-10 17:47:17 Breaks my heart to see what has happened in AB and continues to happen here. I don't believe the true impact of the destruction of AB has hit the rest of the country yet, trickle down effect. AB has taken a hit in every sector, oil and gas, coal, agriculture and small business

3909 2018-04-10 17:46:51 Can y’all just change my oil a little faster please

3915 2018-04-10 17:46:08 @JohnnyMercerUK

Hey Johnny!

Pretend for a moment the oil is irrelevant. Now answer this, without looking it up on the internet:

Can you remember, off the top of your head, why we first become so morally interested in Syria? No cheating now!
3916 2018-04-10 17:46:03 Who cares which women Trump did or didn't sleep with before he became President? That's between him and his wife and none of our business. Salacious gossip should not be used by proponents of ME oil theft, destruction and hegemony to try to influence the elected President to war.
3917 2018-04-10 17:45:52 Let me fix your headline for you: "federal Gov holds emergency meeting to try and figure out how to give more taxpayer $ to foreign owned oil companies"
3918 2018-04-10 17:45:46 And Tillerson is out. Keep up if you can. And again logic...US oil exports. Not Russian exports. You know you are arguing with a Progressive Kool Aid drinker. Always disjointed, irrelevant facts if any.
3919 2018-04-10 17:45:33 Our elected PM is controlled by a strident environmentalist inside the PMO that no matter what ... Oil is dead in the ground...SHAM it is
3920 2018-04-10 17:45:28 My mind instantly went to cannabis oil. Then I was like well that doesn’t make sense...... -M
3921 2018-04-10 17:45:23 They won’t because they don’t care because Canada  oil and gas remember is the great Satan in their eyes but they are ok with Islamic fascist oil but raw sewage and real pollution does not matter power and control and focusing on fake problems are more important
3922 2018-04-10 17:45:22 My friends are cheap & I’m bougie. That’s like oil & water

3924 2018-04-10 17:45:16 @LindaFoods Tried the Linda McCartney sausages today. Very nice - but finding Palm OIl as an one of the ingredients was unexpected.
3925 2018-04-10 17:45:04 The world is still very hungry for oil.  If canada doesnt supply it, terrorist regimes guilty of unimaginable atrocities will happily supply it.
3926 2018-04-10 17:45:02 Facts are facts, history counts right. Like he said there’s room in Manchester for both teams but right now you look poor simple and you play boring football. I love oil money, you make sure you continue to fill you’re car up or pay for any activity that requires oil. On my way
3927 2018-04-10 17:44:59 Excellent. This is something I always check for. On health grounds as well as environmental. British rapeseed oil also brightens up the countryside!

3939 2018-04-10 17:43:39 Trump has always been in love with big oil and big coal, their interests are diametrically opposed to biofuel industry.

3942 2018-04-10 17:43:31 Hi Frankiebella, palm oil is a type of vegetable oil that you can eat and is grown on the oil palm tree. Palm oil is cheaper than other animal oils, so it’s used in a lot of supermarket and beauty products. It’s nearly all grown in the rainforest areas of Indonesia and Malaysia.
3943 2018-04-10 17:43:28 There has been a 1 vehicle RTC on the Saintfield Road in Crossgar.

This is causing delays in both directions whilst the area is cleared of oil and debris.
3944 2018-04-10 17:43:26 I use a coconut water face wash, toner, and moisturizer (with SPF) from Alaffia, with a little bit of coconut oil in between the toner and moisturizer. It doesn't do much for the redness in my skin, but it starts soft and super hydrated.
3945 2018-04-10 17:43:23 This is actually amazing, I have always been passionate about palm oil and you've just made my day! 
3946 2018-04-10 17:43:01 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot

3959 2018-04-10 17:42:02 I once told my husband that I didn't get married to still change the oil in my car.  Some stuff I do. Some stuff he does.
3960 2018-04-10 17:41:56 Democrats don’t want to give you their own money but are quite happy to take money from everyone else “for the greater good”

3963 2018-04-10 17:41:48 Asking about TransMountain now,, they believe the oil will get to market just at this point it is uncertain how it will get to the markets they want. #ParklandCounty
3964 2018-04-10 17:41:38 Snap! I said the same thing. He’ll steal everything that isn’t nailed down because he is a snake oil salesman, a charlatan, a cheat and a scoundrel.  Sounds quaintly like a side character in a period novel, but this one will start WWIII if he’s painted into a corner.
3965 2018-04-10 17:41:30 Me too...love toasted sesame oil, but a little goes a long way . Do you like tofu? I have an amazing and easy recipe for baked tofu that blows people away.
3966 2018-04-10 17:41:25 Wait wait oil went up coz us might bomb them now trump said no oil still up? 
3967 2018-04-10 17:41:20 I've always looked for items that say 'sustainable palm oil' and often see vegan items that contain palm oil which to me is pretty ironic knowing its negative impact on Orangutans. Definitely more needs to be done to make sure it is sourced responsibly.
3968 2018-04-10 17:41:06 @IcelandFoods #palmoil just seen your MD on Sky News - congratulations on removing palm oil from your own brands. I shall certainly use these in the future.
3969 2018-04-10 17:40:57 That's......... Not how oil chemically works
3970 2018-04-10 17:40:57 This is very good people.

Start reducing the use of fossil fuels. Start creating good jobs producing renewable energies. Get the petroleum industry to clean up their old oil wells now (that will also create a lot of jobs).
3971 2018-04-10 17:40:47 I’d like to hear some plain, direct talk on the CBD oil. I’m tempted to get some but every time I’ve tried other supplements on my dogs they get the shits. Maybe I’m screwing it up or unlucky. Has it been well tolerated?

3989 2018-04-10 17:39:34 Rather than make this comment, why can’t you just say, “I support off shore oil drilling off the coast of California because .....”. It probably would have taken less time than thinking up and tweeting your cookie cutter response that says absolutely nothing.
3990 2018-04-10 17:39:18 Is it true that Alberta only produces very heavy crude oil which has to be lugged/transported all the way to Texas to be processed?

3998 2018-04-10 17:38:39 Our heavenly father also gave us earth to protect, but Christians support 45 to binge on coal, decrease fuel efficiency, tear down natural parks for oil & gas, drill near our shores, reject renewable energy & allow open season on species in peril.

4002 2018-04-10 17:38:29 I still don't get why Alberta isn't awash in royalties from their oil reserves.  Do they give their product away?
4003 2018-04-10 17:38:29 Not all oil produced in Alberta has been from the tarsands. Producers have not only paid ridiculously low royalties, they've saddled citizens with billions of dollars for cleanup. #abpoli

Stealing, oil hunkering, smuggling, subsidy etc
4021 2018-04-10 17:36:26 Oil and gas is barely 50%, and the amount of costs we pay for that in short and long *and in environment makes it ridiculous. Dude this is a losing argument, seriously. Look at the markets, it's over.

4023 2018-04-10 17:36:20 That might be possible if Canada could acquire its oil as cheaply and easily as those other countries. Unfortunately we can’t and are priced out of the market by simple geography.  We need to be cutting-edge in renewable energy - the way forward.

4045 2018-04-10 17:34:05 You do realize that if every nation traded oil in a currency other than USD it would have little to no impact on the American economy.

Nations use USD because it is a common unit of measure.

No GDP is derived because of this.

4047 2018-04-10 17:34:00 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
4048 2018-04-10 17:33:52 Please stay in Washington, Zinke.  Or wherever.  Just don't come back to Montana once your joke assignment at Interior is over.  Maybe you can get a sweet pad on an offshore oil rig just off the coast of Florida.
4049 2018-04-10 17:33:49 I clearly explained to you already, it's about real risk. Lac-Mégantic was about moving oil through a populated area and the fire risk to the 42 people there who lost their lives. Metro Vancouver is much bigger, as is a 650 000 barrel oil tanker. It's about risk, not money.

4059 2018-04-10 17:32:33 I love the Finland jerseys always. Simple and nothing too wild like how USA and Canada try at various tournaments. Simple and to the point!  And the more blue Oil one is better than what Oilers have now (I really hate the orange). 
4060 2018-04-10 17:32:32 I was thinking more baths but a coworker said it possible less baths might help because of oil build up. I know max had them super bad in Louisiana and they cleared up when we .over back to the NW. A vet might help with something topical.

4072 2018-04-10 17:31:24 “When gas is cheap” is quite the caveat in there. What exactly does this specific policy do to reduce gas prices? I’m no expert but aren’t oil prices calculated on a macro scale? What has this policy done to affect OPEC’s oil production in the future?
4073 2018-04-10 17:31:22 Koch Bros.... the long play that Stalin put into plan with Fred Sr and the John Birch Society... into the Tea Party and checkbook control of the GOP and media with Oil money.

4074 2018-04-10 17:31:20 I'm afraid there is absolutely no such thing as "sustainable palm oil ". When I visited my Uncle in Sabah we rescued and took to Sepilok a baby orang screaming for it's mother who had been killed to make room for a "sustainable plantation"

4080 2018-04-10 17:30:39 If the demand for bitumen decreases, because other less costly oil is found, the amount of bitumen pumped through the KM pipeline decreases. TransMountain makes its profit from the amount of bitumen pumped through the pipeline. Basic economics.
4081 2018-04-10 17:30:30 The ONLY reason we are in the Middle East is because of Israel's security, partially, Saudi Arabia's. We do not need oil anymore nor waste our people and money in the desert.

4176 2018-04-10 17:20:36 MSM follow first draft narrative since 2010. It’s propaganda. Golem heights has  Syrian oil stolen, via Turkey under Israel/Saudi coalition via deep state corrupt CIA. Zevi shabbetian reversed virtue betrays Judaism, Isis betray Muslims, Saudi criminals paid via Clinton foundatin
4177 2018-04-10 17:20:32 Thankfully it’s an easy fix. Lil tired aren’t meant for oil country lol
4178 2018-04-10 17:20:29 SENATOR THIS SYRIAN WAR COULD BE ALL ABOUT OIL MY ADVICE EVERY 50sQUARE MILE DIG AND SURVEY FOR OIL !THE THRUTH WILL BE REVEALED! INSTEAD OF USING BOMBS USE YOUR BRAIN
4179 2018-04-10 17:20:23 I hate the smell of gear oil. Can’t stand the stuff and I’ve was my hands up go my elbows and I still smell it
4180 2018-04-10 17:20:22 Crude oil and energy sector are strong and relative underperformance makes it attractive risk/reward setup longer term

Me: "Thanks."

She: "What cream do you use?"

Me: "Honestly? Palm kernel oil."

She: "Hmm...thanks." 

Later, she to another lady.

"I don't know why babes like to lie. Common body cream, she can't tell me."

Lesson: Some girls dislike the truth.
4182 2018-04-10 17:19:48 หิวเหรอคะน้องออย!? ไม่ได้การงั้นพี่ต้องหารูปมาสมทบให้น้องหายหิวค่ะ!!
4183 2018-04-10 17:19:44 Agree with the premise but not the rationale. Vegetable oil (olive, corn) and beets (red velvet) are legit cake ingredients.
4184 2018-04-10 17:19:41 Great job Lee. Now Patty and Clarence need endorsement deal's. Maybe Patty with Beats headphones and maybe Clare with a company that sells dye for beards or shaving creams or men's wave hair oil. I can see Clare's face on the side of boxes
4185 2018-04-10 17:19:41 Don't even season it with more than the canola oil it takes to stop it sticking. Lentils may be our friends, but they also wield the power to punish the wicked.
4186 2018-04-10 17:19:40 My question for you is that why is the naira not appreciating now that the foreign reserve has grown over the past months. The excuse for depreciation of the naira during the fall of Oil prices is that we aren't earning enough dollars.
4187 2018-04-10 17:19:39 He had oil on him Ig from working on a car 
4188 2018-04-10 17:19:33 There was actually a smoking area and it was funny because all the people smoking oil pens were coughing their lungs out. It was easy to spot the potheads lmao
4189 2018-04-10 17:19:29 But I thought that after we allowed Pruit & tRUmp to totally dismantle the EPA, allow oil companies to pollute air and water at will, etc.,  we were gonna at least get some slightly cheaper gas!

4191 2018-04-10 17:19:25 Don’t forget about the oil change.
4192 2018-04-10 17:19:15 Brother Tommy Sheridan told us oil was in abundance 4 years ago those that doubted him must feel conned by Westminster and Better Together

4197 2018-04-10 17:18:48 Dear @JimmyJohns,

I know I asked for extra vinegar + oil, but I can't say that I should have to pat my sandwich down with napkins to remove the copious amounts of dressing you put on my sandwich before I eat it.
4198 2018-04-10 17:18:33 Nah man, everyone knows coconut oil's where it's at.
4199 2018-04-10 17:18:29 Fascinating to see the Progressives/DeepState/HollywoodResistance are so down w/ breaking Atty/Client privilege forever just to get Trump.  Imagine an FBI raid on the National Lawyer's Guild for investigations into 'collusion' w/AntiFa/BLM.
4200 2018-04-10 17:18:28 No you didn't, not once. Thanks for not playing. "Foreign funded oil protester".

4206 2018-04-10 17:16:39 I do have the two non-dealership oil change receipts! But our car is old enough to be out of warranty on everything anyhow.
4207 2018-04-10 17:16:32 The ACV will strip the oil out of your skin, and the vitamin E oil put some back into your skin and help with dark spots if you have them too. I use it on a qtip before bed.
4208 2018-04-10 17:16:28 I wish Jenny would b all baby oil and glamoured up naked while she was prego. I'll slap the guate out of her
4209 2018-04-10 17:16:24 Cruise ships are not oil tankers loaded with 650 000 barrels of oil. While there's a terrible environmental impact when one sinks, as we saw when the ferry the Queen of the North went down in 2006, they are not the same. A different spill risk and a very different fire risk.
4210 2018-04-10 17:16:16 SENATOR I REMEMBER SPEAKING TO A FREIND A GEOLOGICAL SURVEY FOR OIL COMPANIES THESE MICROBES ARE AT A CERTAIN DEPTH  THEIR PROPERTIES AND HOW MUCH CONCENTRATE TELL THE STORY YOU HAVE PEOPLE THERE FIND OUT?
4211 2018-04-10 17:16:15 Divinity exists in the contrast. heaven and hell. water and oil. 
Maybe we all exist between the sin and the prayer. And if heaven be above us and hell beneath; perhaps we’re the savior we’ve been praying for.
4212 2018-04-10 17:16:11 Cmon the pool into these oil money bastards
4213 2018-04-10 17:16:07 Coconut oil helps .

4215 2018-04-10 17:16:01 “1. If you eat meat daily, you’re irresponsible.
2. If you travel in combustion engine cars alone, you’re irresponsible.

4216 2018-04-10 17:15:59 Voted for him, disagree with him regularly. But then I see progress. To reap great rewards, take great risks. Something others not done.
4217 2018-04-10 17:15:55 Avoid oils, stick with acids. The acids break down the fats (and oils) in the decomp solution, allowing them to be washed away. Masking one oil with another makes them clump together, and stick to more things together than either would alone.
4218 2018-04-10 17:15:45 Well then your an idiot!! Economics, investment will flee, tech won’t replace it fast enough to recoup all the lost tax revenue!!! Then where do the jobs and investment dollars come from to pay your unemployment to spend all day bitching about oil & gas??? Just curious
4219 2018-04-10 17:15:40 This is against federal law billions has already been spent on every aspect of this pipeline. This is the safest way to transport oil. And you have a responsibility to this country that this gets done.
4220 2018-04-10 17:15:36 @dstaples would the Oil ever consider buying out Sekera and Russell? Would that open up the opp. for someone like John Carlson to be a target for the Oil?
4221 2018-04-10 17:15:29 In your adolescent dreams!  Dirty oil doesn't it in foreign markets!  More importantly the insanity of destroying our mother earth is indicative of the values you hold as a life giver!  Creator gave you a brain, use it wisely!  Bending over for JT is not only sinful but shameful

4224 2018-04-10 17:15:17 I was always for a Canada east pipeline, I agree, we shouldn’t be importing oil.
4225 2018-04-10 17:15:13 @BillClinton I deployed 300 gallons of soybean oil around Key West 3 days before Irma hit.  It spreads itself to monolayer, drops evaporation, like chilling the water, but cheaper and easier.  126 square mile sheen.  Smaller oil deployment worked against Matthew, too.  Help!
4226 2018-04-10 17:15:07 No it’s not! It’s not really a bronzer just a shimmering oil! It’ll add a nice slight tan to you though!
4227 2018-04-10 17:15:05 Absolutely gutted at this.

We are continually being told that oil is worthless or running out which makes me question the authenticity of Westminster politician's, The Media and Industry experts.

It's like a corporate version of the Truman Show!
4228 2018-04-10 17:14:56 Entre @The_Godas y @TomasGarcia_P se puede hacer un monográfico brutal sobre oil. Me vais a hacer empollarme el oro negro no me piquéis.
4229 2018-04-10 17:14:47 Anyone who benefits from increased oil production I guess.
4230 2018-04-10 17:14:41 Trying out these new essential oil combos for my diffuser and now my office smells like a spa and everyone wants to stop by and chat about feelings. This is a place of business, guys.

4233 2018-04-10 17:14:24 Manicure or oil change...
This is a tough one
4234 2018-04-10 17:14:13 Liars the arab oil boom started and capitalist Europe decided it was more profitable than coal because few countries had oil

4237 2018-04-10 17:13:56 Lol Conservatives and equality kinda like water and oil don’t mix
4238 2018-04-10 17:13:56 could be something else like the rice powder or hot water or may be oil/ghee added to the flour while making the dough
4239 2018-04-10 17:13:48 What if the scents our rich Alhajis wore from Mecca was actually Oud oil that we hated so much as kids?
Just got me thinking
4240 2018-04-10 17:13:34 Using existing ag land in temperate regions even for less efficient oil crops may be better for global biodiversity. There are real issues of equity, land consolidation and violence/HR violations w/OP. It's a sub for fossil fuels, but peatlands r full of carbon. It's complicated!
4241 2018-04-10 17:13:09 As they haven’t announced who will be laid off yet I would recommend every Devon employee drive by the state capital on their way home to personally observed the teachers protesting for even higher taxes on oil and gas. Actually maybe drive by at lunch because they leave at 3.30
4242 2018-04-10 17:13:06 Oil is going to $80...bearish narrative is so overplayed and the equities are wildly under-owned.  Chase begins now.
4243 2018-04-10 17:13:03 In NL, the vast majority of NLers. The govt has run deficits in 21 of the last 28 budgets regardless of Equalization or oil royalties. The expectations placed on the NL govt are high.
4244 2018-04-10 17:12:59 Coconut oil and aloe is life.
4245 2018-04-10 17:12:49 @bbcnews "the UK US & France should be careful not to exacerbate the crisis in Syria". Laughable, when the CIA started it all in 2011. It funded foreign terrorists to enter Syria to topple Assad, isolate Iran & create complete US hegemony in the oil rich region. Motive: GREED
4246 2018-04-10 17:12:38 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
4247 2018-04-10 17:12:37 tested oil heater makes you three sheets to the wind
4248 2018-04-10 17:12:31 Reuters’ poll found that Oil products were seen down for the previous week. Gasoline stockpiles are estimated to have declined by almost 1.42 million bbl, distillates have likely declined by 0.38 million bbl. Refinery utilisation likely decreased, reaching 92.9%.

4252 2018-04-10 17:12:14 Snake oil is ALWAYS expensive.
4253 2018-04-10 17:12:10 So Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? WOW.
4254 2018-04-10 17:12:06 You're not an oil painting, hey Steve!
4255 2018-04-10 17:12:00 @jimbotalks Another great show idea hasn't been touched in a while "peak oil" it was supposed to be at a world peak in 1970 but we managed to push back the inevitable by the invention of fracture mining we will feel the intense effects of our usage by 2050. Thanks for serving!
4256 2018-04-10 17:11:52 I just bought a cool new CD/cassette tape player! Night time is a lie! The government is just blocking out the sun! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4257 2018-04-10 17:11:51 No more Middle East interventions, it’s not our responsibility, let the oil rich gulf states take responsibility for a change.
4258 2018-04-10 17:11:51 SENATOR IF THIS IS THE REASON TELL ALL NATIONS INVOLVED TO TELL ASSAD NO NATIONS WILL EVER DO BUSINESS WITH HIM THIS MAY BE REASON RUSSIA INVOLVED THEY KNOW HOW MUCH OIL MAYBE GREATER THAN SAUDI ARABIA!
4259 2018-04-10 17:11:48 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
4260 2018-04-10 17:11:44 No doubt that Conservatives were in the pockets of oil & gas producers. Through corporate media and vested interests, Albertans have been convinced to vote against their own interests. However, Notley demonstrating she's not much different than past Premiers. #abpoli #cdnpoli
4261 2018-04-10 17:11:38 Mpaka ifike wakati wa uchaguzi tutaona mengi sana kwani kila kilicho tolewa kwa kukurupuka leo kina kosolewa wapo ambao wame jistukia wana kuji safisha kwa oil bila kujua wanazidi kuji chafua
4262 2018-04-10 17:11:37 Despite Oil sector contributing a hefty amount each year in govts. tax kitty, most of govt. policies are crying for funds.  The allocation of funds for this year for the policies has also been reduced.and now Oil prices are increasing with the increase in global crude
4263 2018-04-10 17:11:34 At the very least they are gunna be regualted the fuck out of. Data is the new oil and the power zuck can squeeze out of it in the future will be extremely dangerous
4264 2018-04-10 17:11:33 Actually a good piece,just throws up more questions than answers,yes who do we believe?, all for control of huge gas & oil lines that travel through Syria ,Saudi Arabia & Israel both manipulating the region , but Russia & Iran are like a couple of snakes in the grass .
4265 2018-04-10 17:11:17 Would you rather be trapped in a room with: 
a) antivaxxers
b) vegan crossfitters
c) trump supporters
d) homeopath & essential oil evangelizers
4266 2018-04-10 17:11:15 @AllenLone Well Allen the gigs up bud. You told me multiple times over the phone that when oil hit 60-70 us a barrel, all aspects of v.moo were in play. The seismic went out long ago, the pump at lloydminster was being fixed long ago. So what's up ? Did you tell me the truth or ?
4267 2018-04-10 17:11:11 Corporations have a history of lying, killing people and the planet. 
For 20 years Big Oil fought to keep lead in gas, their scientist said lead was safe and the govt said OK.
4268 2018-04-10 17:11:05 Let this crude oil dry up in Nigeria let's see if people's senses can start working. Every meaningful discussion you want to hold in this country, everybody's brain starts screaming crude oil, crude oil, OR our oil, our oil, OR it belongs to all of us, it belongs to all of us.
4269 2018-04-10 17:10:48 It includes the oil and they work pretty fast too

4279 2018-04-10 17:10:03 It's been a little while since I was thinking about it daily, but palm oil is the most efficient oil seed crop/hectare. It can provide income to poor rural farmers in the Tropics. Where it replaces extensive cattle, it's maybe even a net positive for BD eg Cesar Colombia. HOWEVER
4280 2018-04-10 17:10:03 Would I have to buy the oil from them or could I bring my own ?
4281 2018-04-10 17:09:50 @vainglory Someone create an art for like "Hell" kestrel where her arrows are flames her ult is a single flame which explodes on impact and her B has oil until someone gets hit on it and it gets enveloped in flames

4288 2018-04-10 17:09:17 Consider May crude was testing 6000 support YESTERDAY!  It soared to today's 6536 high... an 8.9% move in two sessions! Even if Trump strikes Syria, there's plenty of other oil to go around.  For the courageous, you might want to sell June crude and pray!  You'd need a wide stop.
4289 2018-04-10 17:09:17 Why women nowadays be looking like they rubbed palm oil pun their face.
4290 2018-04-10 17:09:15 #Brent #crudeoil crosses $70.

4298 2018-04-10 17:08:51 A Reuters’ poll found that US crude oil stocks likely increased by 220,000 bbl, following an increase week before. The build, if confirmed would further support the upward trend started in mid-January.

4302 2018-04-10 17:08:32 So basically you are saying that the rights of Texas oil companies and people in other provinces outweigh the rights of BC citizens to protect their environment.
This is not why I voted for you.
4303 2018-04-10 17:08:20 Where is the oil going? Who owns the oil? China? Why are we perpetually price-gauged for oil?  Why are we investing in oil infrastructure when global warming is such a serious issue? Why are we carbon taxed and still investing in major oil infrastructure?

4312 2018-04-10 17:07:17 Why do the rabidly anti-Notley crowd blame the NDP for the mess the Conservative government left? Cons could at least have forced #BigOil to budget for cleanup of their sites. They could have budgeted for taking care of workers when the price of oil dropped. But no. #abpoli
4313 2018-04-10 17:07:12 US Dollar also down 10% over same time frame  

some of those gains are adjusting for that

but maybe they can create an imaginary currency which consumes an enormous amount of energy, to get around sanctions, increase oil demand  

really is silly

4416 2018-04-10 16:57:23 Climate leaders don’t build pipelines. What happened to investing in sustainable energy and diversifying resources? Feels pretty far from platform for a sustainable AB. Feels like trying to catch the conservative oil vote - what about young professional ABs who voted for change?
4417 2018-04-10 16:57:21 No problem.  We can easily replace the 2% of the GDP that comes from the tar sands with solar, wind and insulation retrofitting jobs that are needed to move away from fossil fuels.  Investments in wind and solar produce way more jobs than the oil industry.

4440 2018-04-10 16:55:30 13 years no oil change,  just add oil when needed 
4441 2018-04-10 16:55:23 When you find out that the Dealership you got your car from doesn’t honor the free oil change for life no more. Wtf I ain’t had this car for more than 2 years yet
4442 2018-04-10 16:55:19 Ok see now this really pisses me off! I am a resident of BC, born and bred here actually and there is more to investment in my Province than just Big Oil. So, Ms Notley take your bully tactics and your bitumen and stick em where the sun don’t shine....
4443 2018-04-10 16:55:10 @JustinTrudeau why are the Federal government ( Liberals).Allowing the gas refineries to absolutely gouge Canadians for gas.They are making historical massive profits by keeping gas prices high over the price of a barrel of oil.Canada has one of the richest oil sands in the world

4445 2018-04-10 16:55:09 For me, China buying oil in Yuan so that they're not tied to the hip with the USD, which they realise doesn't have much value. But still holding UST, just not buying more
4446 2018-04-10 16:55:08 Also, "a witch/warlock hunt" inferes that the party being investigated is innocent. However Sir Misogyny the Orange is probably the least likeliest person to be innocent. This two-bit flim-flam snake oil selling confidence man is on a losing streak and is going down in flames.
4447 2018-04-10 16:55:06 Bidding for oil in CNY leads to $/CNY rate by reference to oil. China must withhold physical $ oil demand from Western oil market complex & draw down oil inventory in order to try & force (US/Saudi manipulated) $ prices to lower levels through a Buyer's Strike.

4459 2018-04-10 16:54:20 That is not how crude oil import prices are decided..they are decided on the basis of weighted average price of oil for a particular period

4464 2018-04-10 16:54:05 Can't you count? Which is bigger 60,000,000 or 5,000,000? Numbers don't appear to be lying unless next to Scotland's secret oilfields there are hidden 55,000,000 valid Scottish voters? Wood didn't say oil would run out, he said it would become more expensive to recover.
4465 2018-04-10 16:54:03 I will retract & say I know she would not shoot kids, but she does come across as a very self centered & mean spirited when she doesn’t get her own way. Today she says she will cut off oil to BC totally unconcerned about seniors, kids etc dependent on it for health care & school.
4466 2018-04-10 16:53:40 Like bloody oil tankers lol

4469 2018-04-10 16:53:07 Access to clean water will continue to plague our entire world;this is an ongoing dilemma which may encourage worldwide greedy,unethical business conglomerates to start cashing in on water distribution as they do w/ oil.

4478 2018-04-10 16:52:14 I'm not sure she will do that Keith, too costly for Alberta. I'm thinking she may stop BC's oil and gas exports into Alberta. Maybe slow down shipping from Vancouver Harbours across Canada? Trucks and trains. Those sorts of things will get major attention when ships are stalled.

4486 2018-04-10 16:51:15 So, oil should be transported by rail or truck rather than by pipeline? 
Or, should oil be better sourced from Saudi Arabia or another country?

4490 2018-04-10 16:50:43 So City escape action over coin thrown at Jose, and will also escape action for throwing flares. The @FA will just write to them... It's amazing how far that oil money gets these days.
4491 2018-04-10 16:50:30 You miss my point.
Palm oil is very efficient to farm - each hectare of land yielding over 10Tonnes of palm oil.
Replacing the output of 1ha of palm plantation will require 5ha of sunflower, 7ha of rapeseed or 14ha of cattle (for butter).
How will this help the environment?
4492 2018-04-10 16:50:19 I avoid like a plague anything with palm oil. All supermarkets should stop using it now.

4527 2018-04-10 16:48:23 Well, I brought nuts (which I have no problem with) and cheese. I might have had it easier than you since I don't have to be as careful in restaurants with the oil, just the eggs, but I ended up getting cheeseburgers and brussels sprouts, or chicken and vegetables.
4528 2018-04-10 16:48:17 The sky is falling. The sky is falling!  No more oil if this pipeline doesn’t get built. Sounds a lot like a ransom note to me.

4573 2018-04-10 16:44:19 Hi, currently 50% of all supermarket products currently contain palm oil. We’re busy working behind the scenes to replace palm oil in all of our own label products, by the end of 2018. We're speaking to our branded suppliers & encouraging them to make the positive change too.

4576 2018-04-10 16:44:11 Soy is the cheapest oil you see, so most baked goods but also most salad dressings, fryolator oil & a lot of things in restaurants are drenched in it. You are constantly eating it. <3
4577 2018-04-10 16:44:05 I have oil in my balls
4578 2018-04-10 16:44:01 Thanks for posting. As a responsible retailer we have met our commitment to exclusively use certified sustainable palm oil for all of our food products. We have completed an extensive programme of moving all of the palm oil in our own-label food products to RSPO certified oil 1/3
4579 2018-04-10 16:43:46 Why can’t more people understand that we can value oil and embrace its benefits — while ALSO dealing sensibly with the associated costs from GHG emissions with a well-designed carbon price? Is it too much to ask for a balanced view? Sheesh!
4580 2018-04-10 16:43:45 “Our oil”. You must own an oil company. Can you post a source showing which oil products in pipelines Canadians actually own or which pipelines Cdns actually own?

4600 2018-04-10 16:42:28 Perhaps bc 1 of the absolute worst things that could happen for US geopolitically & economically right now would be for px of oil to tank.  HY spreads widen, tax receipts fall, trade deficit rises further, Fed has to reverse course...USD might be repriced lower in a BIG hurry...
4601 2018-04-10 16:42:22 glad to see, Adrian, that your finger/oil painting skills have improved.
4602 2018-04-10 16:42:15 but look at the other Light crude outside the US. Their differentials are already falling to compete with the US barrels with such a wide arb and low prices. Suggests the market wont easily absorb the a lot more light crude oil.
4603 2018-04-10 16:42:15 that’s where they go under cars to change oil in the shop, he is very much alive but sustained some minor injuries

4608 2018-04-10 16:41:40 I was told I have a body that would be great for bodybuilding competitions. Those niggas measure the amount of oil they use to saute, that's not a lifestyle I want
4609 2018-04-10 16:41:26 Well good that you do! Well done. That's great cause it's sad that they have to die for something unnecessary as an oil you could easily replace. Thank you!
4610 2018-04-10 16:41:16 It’s just so simple, big oil money pays an instigator to start trouble in the country(property) they want, so taking it over with military force is justified. Funny how all the oil geopolitical zones have issues with peace that can be resolved with bombs and military occupation.
4611 2018-04-10 16:41:11 I bought some oil to ward me from negative energy over the weekend. They say whatever mood you're in is the vibes that you will attract. I put some on this morning, let me change my energy.

4641 2018-04-10 16:39:12 Location would also be a factor in choosing the oil. It's more natural & healthier to work with materials that are indigenous to the local ecosystem  In South Pacific, add coconut oil, in Africa add native palm & shea, in Sonoran Desert, add jojoba, in Orient, add sesame, etc

The oil and gas were mentioned in the original tweet. The fish, thanks to the CFP, are an EU resource. I wouldn't classify wind, tides and sunshine as resources, and consider attempts to exploit them for energy as worse than useless.

4660 2018-04-10 16:37:53 The fact::1st the us alone uses 1 billion gallons of oil each day, that comes from just under the crust of the Earth.2nd then pump it into the air and the form of carbon monoxide.A double eco-disaster the oil is there for a reason. A delicate balance.Poor Mother Earth,need change
4661 2018-04-10 16:37:45 oil up 3%? mbs wants oil at $80? there wouldnt be a ksa $ new issue today would there?
4662 2018-04-10 16:37:42 Buy British produced oil if you're concerned about GMO. There's no market here for imported oil, apart from olive oil, as crops are easily grown here.
Palm oil on the other hand is horribly destructive generally, but difficult to avoid if you buy convenience foods.
4663 2018-04-10 16:37:38 It seems on point. Oklahoma's budget situation was definitely a product of both the decline in oil prices and tax cuts.

4699 2018-04-10 16:35:03 (Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil) after making a pledge in 2011. In contrast to our competitors, we do not accept Greenpalm certificates, to ensure that all of the palm oil used in our products is traceable throughout the supply chain. 2/3
4700 2018-04-10 16:35:03 Mr Weaver you still have not given an alternative to the towns in BC that relay on oil and gas So put your money where your mouth is and get these green industries you claim can takes oil and gas place and bring them to the north east cheap land in Fort Nelson for industrial use.
4701 2018-04-10 16:35:00 If you were arguing that we should be refining bitumen domestically you’d have a point, but you’re not. You’re arguing we should be exporting our bitumen, which won’t change the amount of foreign oil we import in the slightest. Don’t pretend like you care about human rights
4702 2018-04-10 16:34:56 in any case no kind of plant oil should be used as #fuel #biodieselgate
4703 2018-04-10 16:34:49 My body isn’t much of a temple, Hennessy and Oil and sleep at the opposite times
4704 2018-04-10 16:34:44 Thanks for posting. As a responsible retailer we have met our commitment to exclusively use certified sustainable palm oil for all of our food products. We have completed an extensive programme of moving all of the palm oil in our own-label food products to RSPO certified oil 1/2
4705 2018-04-10 16:34:40 Hi Chris, thanks for getting in touch. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.
4706 2018-04-10 16:34:39 Some chicken and asparagus and cherry tomatoes in some kind of wine butter oil situation
4707 2018-04-10 16:34:37 Hi, Hugh, we'd like to assure you that caring for the environment has always been at the heart of our brand. We are committed to traceability and transparency, and only sell products containing krill oil that comes from MSC and Friends of the Sea certified sustainable 1/2
4708 2018-04-10 16:34:35 You’d think a resident of a province that has suffered because of the influence that oil companies have over its economy would be more worried about THAT.
4709 2018-04-10 16:34:31 I have no idea what oil is doing , the draw though August will be one for the history books, price finally figuring that out??!!
4710 2018-04-10 16:34:21 It is a legacy of the 70s when our problem is not money and lau lau was the order of the day. So the entire thing was subsidised to the hilt. We entered a goldilocks zone. We are still struggling with that addiction. Oil sickness.
4711 2018-04-10 16:34:18 Do bio oil work?

4714 2018-04-10 16:34:02 Oil pipelines. EU should send in their troops or buy American oil and gas or buy Russia gas and definitely get out of GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa and Syrians. This is getting ridiculous.
4715 2018-04-10 16:33:49 Our opinion is that removing palm oil from supply chains may seem like a solution, but alternative oils could require up to 10 times as much land leading to higher risks of deforestation. 1/2
4716 2018-04-10 16:33:42 You didn’t fully read my tweet.  Substantial investments in alternatives are occurring, and particularly by oil and gas producers. Do the research.
4717 2018-04-10 16:33:42 shaving with coconut oil be the best 
4718 2018-04-10 16:33:42 Queer Eye is essentially the best show ever for teaching me that you should take the time to feel good about yourself, and coconut oil can get the smell of garlic out of your hands.
4719 2018-04-10 16:33:36 Trump and his family are making billions off international deals and oil. He writes off donations and makes money with free golf trips weekly on our dime. His cabinet members costing taxpayers millions. Trump raised debt trillion$$$

4724 2018-04-10 16:32:50 OK twitter. If anyone can retweet this to someone that matters. I was done SOOO WRONG by @Valvoline. They knew they broke it and was trying to rig it back on for get me out the door. Stopped in to get oil change Friday (talked into letting them change Serpentine belt) Big mistake
4725 2018-04-10 16:32:45 Well I'm glad to report the plan is not to dump the oil in the ocean. I think everyone would be against that.
4726 2018-04-10 16:32:39 The picture on your post speaks a thousand words. Your self greed from oil..No province should be forced to take oil through their province if there is an environmental impact as the pipeline does.safey and save the environment before your greed.Keep oil here and lower gas prices

4735 2018-04-10 16:31:40 It’s getting rid of the old oil that’s the tough part, u can’t just pour it down the drain which is why a lot of people go to get it changed from a shop
4736 2018-04-10 16:31:34 Hi there, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.

4738 2018-04-10 16:31:12 Yes, companies exist to make a profit for their shareholders, but it would also generate $5.7 billion in provincial tax revenue and $1 billion in municipal tax revenue (within BC). As for the environment, that oil is going to move by rail if not by pipeline.
4739 2018-04-10 16:30:59 Wait,  weren't you one of Roy Moore's defenders? Have several seats, you hypocritical snake oil salesman.
4740 2018-04-10 16:30:55 Unless oil crashes, the ruble isn't going to weaken that much regardless of sanctions. However, ruble assets are likely quite crowded

4749 2018-04-10 16:30:05 Yes because we keep investing in oil and neglecting progressive policies that give renewables what they need to grow. Investors need to change. But oil has such a grip on everyone, that status quo remains. It will be 25-50 years before solar, not far...
4750 2018-04-10 16:30:05 The longer the teachers stay out the more resistance is building in Oklahoma. Incredible number of people making less than teachers. Can't hurt or one economic leg oil and gas or schools worse off
4751 2018-04-10 16:30:03 If I had a castor oil business I would get her in! Epic ad!
4752 2018-04-10 16:30:00 Getting an oil change and this woman and her kid won't shut up. The rest of us don't need to know your business and we certainly don't want to hear it... 
4753 2018-04-10 16:29:33 Which is why the USSR supplied Nazi Germany with millions of tons of grain, oil, tried to ally with them, etc.
4754 2018-04-10 16:29:18 This Moroccan Argon Oil better work.
4755 2018-04-10 16:29:13 There needs to be incentive for palm oil growers to produce sustainable palm oil. If there is little demand from major palm oil importers like Europe growers will simply turn to other oils. Consumers have the power to demand only certified sustainable palm oil be used in 1/2
4756 2018-04-10 16:28:39 The American populace has been utterly brainwashed to believe the Middle East stories .  Talk to any Christian  who is Syrian they will tell you Assad was the good guy ,  quit believing cnn and major media lies. They want him out cus they can’t get their hands on the oil .
4757 2018-04-10 16:28:25 Hi Sophia, thanks for getting in touch. We are saying ‘no’ to palm oil because of the  negative impact that this ingredient is having on the people, animals and environment where it is grown and processed (particularly to orangutans who are on the brink of extinction).

4762 2018-04-10 16:27:47 The Albertan oil sands are visually hideous, literally the optical opposite of the pristine lands in BC that you desire to pockmark with bitumen. No! You and other Albertans have ruined your own province for financial gain. How dare you? No. BC is not yours.
4763 2018-04-10 16:27:37 Wish I hadastore nearer to me in Harrogate.. I would buy your products now.

4765 2018-04-10 16:27:23 No price is too high to appease the #ClimateGods - & poorer people use less energy thus less #CO2 which appears to be the goal here. Why not put car or aerospace industry under same scrutiny? Are they not the biggest CO2 emitters/users? Oil industry only supplies what’s demanded

4777 2018-04-10 16:26:14 Nothing compared to the lie told to the Scottish people 40 odd years ago that there were only 10 years oil reserves,and funny that lie is still being peddled.
4778 2018-04-10 16:26:04 It's true none the less. Didn't the usa company standard oil sell an additive to ig farben so the luftwaffe would have aviation fuel? There's money to be made from poor men killing each other. Think how many lives would have been saved if they weren't so greedy
4779 2018-04-10 16:26:03 The deep state have been trying to remove Assad since Obama - so they can : 
1. Build a pipeline through Syria for the oil interests
2. Keep CIA-trained "rogue elements" like ISIS in place to create continuous chaos and churn waves of refugees to the West - per Soros orders.
4780 2018-04-10 16:26:01 Oil’s well that endeth badly.

4783 2018-04-10 16:25:49 You can’t really wash off machine oil with regular soap as it is pretty sticky and hard. Just heat over an empty burner.
4784 2018-04-10 16:25:47 Word games. They didn't say there weren't threats, just no "credible" threats. The Boston bombers and Nikolas Cruz were also not considered to be "credible" threats.

4793 2018-04-10 16:25:05 For instance, we slice a bunch of scallions daily and at the end of the night they get tossed (because the smell bad by the second day) so For one dish we’ll be making a scallion oil that works just fine with end-of-night scallions. It saves us both prep time and waste.

4797 2018-04-10 16:24:47 Please can I ask what you will use to replace the palm oil and why you think this decision helps the environment?
Did you know that palm is the most efficient oil to grow?
If you replace palm with sunflower, you will need to grow 5ha of sunflower to replace every 1ha of palm
4798 2018-04-10 16:24:42 So they’re not going to sell peanut butter Nutella and many many things that are on people’s shopping lists week in week out?

4807 2018-04-10 16:23:47 And you have to BE AWARE of this information...
4808 2018-04-10 16:23:41 Treu

4810 2018-04-10 16:23:30 It gets worse in the Oil and Gas sector. Read the book “Poisoned Wells” by Nicholas Shaxon. They French even control the elections.

4812 2018-04-10 16:23:23 Only in clutch side dont run synthetic. Run the hondapro transmission oil, belray thumper trans oil (80w85, same as Honda stuff) or straight up valvoline Maxlife ATF and change that stuff every ride regardless of what you run. They're hard on gear oil.

4819 2018-04-10 16:23:06 Love this!! Tired of people selling hemp oil as CBD!
4820 2018-04-10 16:23:05 especially if we keep selling an unrefined product for a foreign owned company to foreign countries. Keep our oil here, refine it here, sell it here!
4821 2018-04-10 16:22:57 Some of the neocons wanted to establish similar rights on countries that has oil.
4822 2018-04-10 16:22:55 So this wretched PM of ours is thinking of bombing Assad without a literal shred of quality on the ground evidence, the white helmets are as believable as an xmas panto...im sure this had nothing at all with the Rothschilds wanting their oil pipeline across Syria...
4823 2018-04-10 16:22:45 Is it not a shame that we cannot refine our crude oil in Nigeria.  How long will this destruction of our economy continue?  What kind of leaders do we continue to vote into office in Nigeria?  God help us.
4824 2018-04-10 16:22:35 probably they brought oil and some rags to clean and fix them. Like the other protests where people left the place cleaner then when they arrived.

ふせったーくんがフィルタリングに捕まっ……！？！？！？、！？！？
4833 2018-04-10 16:21:46 I took a shower and put sweet orange oil in my diffuser. But am struggling too, mostly because I’ve been sick on/off since Feb. Currently on antibiotics and have a deadline on Friday 
4834 2018-04-10 16:21:44 Now i know how to do my own oil change next step breaks.
4835 2018-04-10 16:21:41 The main thing you have to worry about witb metal tools is machine oil coating them. I treat them like I would a New wok: heat over a burner to burn off the oil from all surfaces, then season by rubbing witb vegetable oil.
4836 2018-04-10 16:21:18 Coming back to my earlier message.
That jungle on the head needs proper trimming. 
You don't put oil in your hair. They look life less. Soon you could be balding.
4837 2018-04-10 16:20:59 No, Trump won't 'start a war.' US occupies Syria, proxies control most of its oil, US has backed dozens of 'rebel' groups & encouraged client states to do same, including by funneling fighters to IS & AQ, its "war on IS" has killed 1000s of Syrians. This would be an escalation.
4838 2018-04-10 16:20:59 Appointment was quick! I guess oil changes only take 40 mins and not 4 hours. Be on soon Gooo00000nzzzz.
4839 2018-04-10 16:20:52 Notley claimed Horgan could not reduce flow of Bituman. So how can she restrict the flow of oil to BC ? Punishing residents of BC will have no effect on Horgan.
4840 2018-04-10 16:20:46 I drizzle them with olive oil. I prefer oven baked fries. I have a few tricks to make them crispy. I think they have much better flavor this way.
4841 2018-04-10 16:20:43 Did you get the final ratings in yet?
4842 2018-04-10 16:20:34 Great reply on the BBC by @darrelwebb of @RSPOtweets to the misguided policy towards @IcelandFoods on palm oil. Boycotting is the wrong policy. Support sustainable palm!
4843 2018-04-10 16:20:30 so guess who just spilt a litre of oil on the kitchen floor #skiptonicerink
4844 2018-04-10 16:20:23 Agreed.  Their chicken biscuits are meh.  Bojangles breakfast is where it’s at 
4845 2018-04-10 16:20:14 Yes, from now everything will be deep fried in motor oil.
4846 2018-04-10 16:20:08 This nigga got hurt and Told the trainer “don’t touch me I got Haitian oil for it “  the most island thing I heard in a while.
4847 2018-04-10 16:20:07 Marketing and economy is so hardddddddd  my brain cannot process anymore data that related to lpg, crude oil apa benda semua ni aku nak balik utp belajar batu je
4848 2018-04-10 16:20:03 so my cousin apparently just started a company selling high quality hemp oil in Colorado so lol that's a thing
4849 2018-04-10 16:20:03 Crude Oil $USO $UCO is following the bullish script we discussed last week, likely carving out a Jan-Apr. bullish digestion-Coil type of pattern that will resolve itself in a thrust to the upside into a new upleg that projects to $70 next. The Saudis would like to see $80 oil..
4850 2018-04-10 16:20:01 ขอบคุณค่ะ
4851 2018-04-10 16:20:01 I was not. Elexis could not discuss it with me because my daughter took my car and used my money to get an oil change. The reply took me from upset to angry.  I am 
now of the opinion @Pepboys doesn't care.
4852 2018-04-10 16:19:56 You put oil is Goodnight? @GodrejGroup
4853 2018-04-10 16:19:50 I am a bit surprised by the tone of this story since the expansion of the @TransMtn will go a long way to reducing the number of oil trains running through Washington (an issue you take dearly to heart) and will also ensure better tanker safety off our shared coast?
4854 2018-04-10 16:19:44 Small acorns grow.But palm oil is to some countries their gold currency.
4855 2018-04-10 16:19:35 Big Relief for ONGC!

Iran agrees to buy entire gas produced from Farzad-B field at imported-LNG equivalent rate 

Next hurdle RoI to ONGC (RoI comes to 6% against 15% sought by ONGC)

Upper hand with ONGC oil purchase volume for 18-19 not finalized
4856 2018-04-10 16:19:30 Cody, how much for an oil change and car wash inside/out? Ford Flex 2010@thepitstopIP
4857 2018-04-10 16:19:29 Lead them from temptation, make them royalty. All the things we facing make us question it. Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please. 

That’s how we become kings and queens.
4858 2018-04-10 16:19:09 Production has been stagnant for yrs. They missed the shale boom. Replacing reserves requires risky investment in Brazil, Qatar, Guyana, Papua New Guinea, etc. They have an unearned premium to other oil majors. Investors would rather own $PSX, $EOG, $KMI, than a conglomerate.

4861 2018-04-10 16:19:00 EIA projects that oil demand will continue to increase for the next 22 years. Canada MUST be the #1 supplier of that oil, not Russia, Venezuela, Saudi, Iran, etc.

2. #Iraq invasion by Bush 2003 under WMD pretext not for burning #ExxonMobil oil fields  
3. Two wrong don't make a right.
4863 2018-04-10 16:18:47 I think Muller Muller seems to have money from the oil states but it looks like the American House is not looking for money to serve America to Trump's only sister and this is a misnomer house that will fall down and Mueller will benefit foreign parties
4864 2018-04-10 16:18:46 @ImanAbdulRahim knpa i pkai night cream and cleansing oil, muke i naik whitehead yg kecik2 and merah2 pastu bump... Lgi2 kat dagu and pipi.. Byk gila.... 
4865 2018-04-10 16:18:43 BP predicts oil demand will plateau (not peak) by 2030-2040, EVEN IF we have a worldwide ban of internal combustion engine new sales by 2040. How? #bnefsummit
4866 2018-04-10 16:18:31 As to renewables, there’s insufficient commercially available to meet needs. Canada will be dependant on fossil fuels until at least mid, possibly late, century. That doesn’t, and hasn’t, stopped investment in alternatives, including large investments by oil & gas producers.
4867 2018-04-10 16:18:30 U R talking about sassy robots when $billions is being lost every month via 1) discounted CDN oil to the USA, 2) 900,000 bbl/day of imported oil and 3) NO progress on pipelines east or west.  2019 will be the end of your gov't, thank God
4868 2018-04-10 16:18:29 Absolutely! We need to find a bigger market for the harvest though. Does seal oil have the same medicinal benefits of other oils?
4869 2018-04-10 16:18:22 At the same time, they are increasing the forecast of oil prices at stations

4873 2018-04-10 16:18:07 We ll get oil from Russia & US ... Don't worry about it... If pakistan invade everybody knows the result as u know what has happened in past... History ll repeat itself... How long we ll worry about impact.. We r sepending around 1 lac cores yearly on this issue.. let's finish it
4874 2018-04-10 16:18:05 Why FBI not found Trump wrong to met Saudi crown prince Mohammad for oil and money!
4875 2018-04-10 16:17:53 Are you stating that Libertarians leave it to faith that some entrepreneur will invest time & capital to address issues? Why hasn't anyone capitalized on this sector already? Because the profit margins aren't there.  Not unless the govt. steps in to subsidise it; like oil was.

4878 2018-04-10 16:17:39 Disaster capitalism at its most basic. How can I benefit off the perils of others, even going so far as to create the disasters. Arming teachers or man-made climate change even of benefit to those mercilessly seeking profit. Encapsulated by the biggest snake oil salesman of all.
4879 2018-04-10 16:17:34 Purely herbal formulations without oils and alkalis have superior attributes for the nature and health of people and all other beings. That said, if making soap using oil was my goal, the best choices would be olive oil for skin soap & tallow or lard for laundry soap.
4880 2018-04-10 16:17:33 im not wearing makeup have my coconut oil in my hair so it's in a crusty bun AND I'm a bit ill yet everybody comes out the wood work to compliment me
4881 2018-04-10 16:17:28 “The reality is that Canada—the 5th largest oil producer in the world—maintains an almost singular reliance on one market. Such a situation is unique in the world and will always carry associated concerns.”  Quote from latest @IHSMarkitEnergy Oil Sands Dialogue report.
4882 2018-04-10 16:17:20 @IcelandFoods so impressed with your decision to ban palm oil in your own branded products by the end by 2018. Massive thank you. @Tesco @sainsburys @marksandspencer @waitrose are you going to following suit? Pressure is now on. #banpalmoil #savetheanimals
4883 2018-04-10 16:17:14 Coconut oil stank
4884 2018-04-10 16:17:13 Never boil these, it's nasty af. But if you keep it dry as possible and marinate in olive oil, lemon pepper, chicken powder, garlic powder, light black pepper, cayenne pepper powder, and melted butter and squeezed lemon, and then roast it in the oven at 450 and apply BBQ.

4890 2018-04-10 16:16:51 I think the loyalists betrayed you. Seen one replacing his lost M-Pesa line while drinking Brookside milk. After making a withdarwal, he bought a litre of Bidco cooking oil. I think resistnace could be illusional.
4891 2018-04-10 16:16:45 Gas price goes up in Canada but send oil to the USA an have to bye it back at a higher price what’s wrong with this
4892 2018-04-10 16:16:40 (he looks a bit sheepish as he reaches to turn down the heat) Yeah, yeah, I know. Not afraid of saws but a bit of spitting oil and I'm jumping but that stuff burns.
4893 2018-04-10 16:16:35 Thank you so much for your reply. I realise it is a very difficult task and I do try to avoid products with Palm oil in, like Bertolli spread, I now use Yep Valley as they don't use it. Hopefully if the know they are losing customers it will force change.

One day this nightmare will be over and #Syria will be free of all those   that tried to annihilate her.

4914 2018-04-10 16:15:17 Why threaten? Just do it! If we have oil reservoirs if they still exist, it's time we have one for cement and another for steel bars.
4915 2018-04-10 16:15:16 Thanks, @Bnsims. Since salons are independently owned, you'll have to check with them directly for their return/exchange policy. You may also want to check out Dry Remedy Daily Moisturizing Oil. Use a few drops as a leave-in to add instant moisture and softness. ^lg

4919 2018-04-10 16:14:40 Hey @marksandspencer how about following Icelands lead and removing palm oil from your own products. All organisations that want to be considered as ethical and a watchword for  quality should be making this commitment
4920 2018-04-10 16:14:38 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

She: "Hmm...thanks." 

Later, she to another lady.

"I don't know why babes like to lie. Common body cream, she can't tell me."

4943 2018-04-10 16:12:37 I don't understand.  If palm oil is most efficient to produce, won't Iceland have to replace this with other vegetables oils that take up more land to produce causing even more deforestation?

4949 2018-04-10 16:12:19 Pipe line and tankers are way safer than rail and truck. Right now you are getting the oil by rail and truck. If CO2 had anything to do with climate,then blocking the pipeline is hurting the climate but really you are just hurting your economy which hurts poor people the most
4950 2018-04-10 16:12:15 Thanks to new technologies & horizontal drilling, America is the world’s oil and natural gas leader.

4954 2018-04-10 16:12:08 Why would oil prices increase by more than 3 percent because of an attack on a country that has no impact on oil markets? We had similar events before.... have we had 3% increase?

4958 2018-04-10 16:11:40 BP has committed to two new North Sea developments at an estimated cost to the oil major of £420m with peak production seen reaching 30,000 barrels gross of oil equivalent per day
4959 2018-04-10 16:11:35 This is why @Kenney is working so hard on this.
He sees his role in AN legislature to be to get taxpayer money to the oil companies that he works for.
To heck with those pesky working Albertans. Those.mere voters!

4965 2018-04-10 16:11:11 Transporting oil and gas via train or truck causes more damage to the environment and more likely to have issues with spills.
4966 2018-04-10 16:11:06 Haven't tweeted in a while. Gonna start doing that more. I need to get an oil change and skate today tho it's my day off. Later

4968 2018-04-10 16:11:03 how would i use the aloe vera just rub it on there ? & castor oil might be to heavy on my hair i’m really not supposed to use oils on my hair 
4969 2018-04-10 16:10:55 Like allopathy, if you get it from an experienced/good practitioner it works. Allopaths (like oil mafia) are too hegemonic about their own stream. So for them any alternative is a scam. Too much money in allopathy/pharma industry at stake to allow alternatives to flourish

4971 2018-04-10 16:10:48 Watercolor/marker/colored pencil did not prepare me for the speed at which I went through my white gouache. How do y'all deal with mediums like oil/acrylic/gouache where you use a shit ton of expensive paint so quickly?
4972 2018-04-10 16:10:46 I mean... imagine him wrestling another big guy. They're both covered in oil, and they've gotta stick their hands down each other's pants to get a good grip. And with all the slipping and sliding Arsalan's pants keep getting pulled and showing a flash of kingly, muscly lion butt.

4974 2018-04-10 16:10:38 A person is 8x more likely to get cancer FROM air pollution associated w/ oil and gas than someone not living near that pollution. Not 8x more likely overall. The avg. total lifetime cancer risk is between 30-40%. This adds about 0.08% to that.

4977 2018-04-10 16:10:27 @IcelandFoods 

Im so impressed with your news, im 
going to start shopping at your store. Bold move removing palm oil.
4978 2018-04-10 16:10:24 You are a person who needs to read up on warrants. Coming from a law enforcement family I know the law you dont. Live in your fantasy world. Our President has done a hell of a lot good. Not snake oil

4984 2018-04-10 16:09:40 I fell asleep with makeup on Sunday night. Long story short: I woke up with a red, dry, itchy, inflamed rash all over my face.  Thank Goodness for @ThePerfectLev skin products. My skin is almost back to normal after only 2 days of using the ‘Don’t Flake On Me’ oil!
4985 2018-04-10 16:09:35 I just want to know why when we are the #1 exporter of oil, we in the US are paying almost $3 a gallon again for no reason other than to make the oil barons even richer. In place of attacking the rights of law abiding citizens, how about fixing a real problem.
4986 2018-04-10 16:09:33 This actually isn't a great move. Switching to @RSPOtweets SG certified Palm Oil would be the right and major step, Oil Palm has an incredible yield per hectare, by moving to alternatives you are in essence using a less sustainable crop source overall.
4987 2018-04-10 16:09:31 Anybody that’s thinking about doing an oil change at economy lube Brantford save your money.  Charge me $71 for synthetic oil change and didn’t even change my oil filter. Scammers. Don’t go there @EconomyLube #dontwasteyourmoney
4988 2018-04-10 16:09:30 A little bit of coconut oil goes a long way
4989 2018-04-10 16:09:29 Maybe if we stopped seeing First Nations groups as homogenous, consent coereced with big $ wouldn't be a marketing tactic by big oil. Any indiv.

4991 2018-04-10 16:09:21 Let us give credit. Saleme summed it up perfectly and courageously when he described Libya to UNSC. The country is hijacked by systemic corruption stemming from the governnance of public finance (oil revenues). The system is driving irresponsibility even from international actors
4992 2018-04-10 16:09:09 GM Butts Trudeau’s handler is anti oil. The reason there are no pipelines being built by liberals.
4993 2018-04-10 16:09:04 Just use coconut oil babe! It’s amazing. Like twice a week melt it and put it on your hair and face, wait an hour, then wash and condition hair like normal! It’s so good for your hair.

5011 2018-04-10 16:06:49 Squire, Patton & Boggs law have cut all ties with Choen and are working with the FBI.  I had no idea about their ties with Cambridge Analytica and Russia's Gazprom oil company. This is very interesting.  We need answers.
5012 2018-04-10 16:06:45 Iran are Syria's #1 ally. Iran have the last non-US/OPEC controlled top-five crude oil reserves (the last was Iraq and just look at what happened to them). Syria has oil but this is about drawing Iran into war for oil, Israel, and the Saudis. Nuclear war flashpoint. Over OIL.
5013 2018-04-10 16:06:43 Guess that's why oil companies always lose money, oh wait...

5053 2018-04-10 16:03:37 You were talking about regulations. How bad they are. Tell that to the people in South Dakota who are currently drinking and bathing in oil. I just saw that the spill was larger than originally estimated. Some 60,000 gallons of oil.

5057 2018-04-10 16:03:29 We fully share Iceland's concerns about the environmental impact of palm oil. Removing palm oil from supply chains may seem like a solution, but alternative oils could require up to 10 times as much land leading to higher risks of deforestation. 1/2

5089 2018-04-10 16:01:32 IF you have the mental capacity, take a course in logic. Trump's military has taken out Russian troops, economy is poised to become oil exporter (not in Russian interests), expelled the Russian diplomats w/embassy near US military base, enacted sanctions...Connect the dots idiot.
5090 2018-04-10 16:01:25 Dear @BCLiberalCaucus - if we focused energy on transition from fossil fuels, we wouldn’t have to increase oil shipments by rail or increase the size of pipelines.

That’s the safest & healthiest option. It also best safeguards the future of the planet.

5095 2018-04-10 16:01:06 So now you conflating oil we use to make gasoline to diluted bitumen. Getting dilbit to tide water is for export to countries that can refine. Canada will still need to import oil to refine for gasoline engines. That means doubling the risk for the same status oil quo we now have

5104 2018-04-10 16:00:14 How can anyone stay informed listening to you, Fox, Info wars? You are a fake christian, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman.
5105 2018-04-10 16:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

Can anyone recommend a professional artist who can assist with restoring a damaged oil painting, please?
5107 2018-04-10 16:00:06 3 higher lows in a row for crude oil. The oil chart may be many things, but one thing it is not is bearish.

5113 2018-04-10 15:58:59 Unfortunately, Syria is important for the US overseas policy. It's the key for easy access to iraqi oil and as a potential partner for Russia, it is a threat for the middle east connections of your country. It's a game between US and Russia. Wake up.

5121 2018-04-10 15:58:05 As an example, palm oil could be replaced by butter from cows fed with unsustainable soy grown at the expense of Amazon forest. Our full statement will be released on our website tomorrow 2/2

It’s the 24 Supertankers carrying 130,000 tons of crude oil in & out of islands, under 2 bridges in tight spaces, with other multiple ferries & ships.

Multiple independent studies have found it’s at RISK !

Albertans should understand, it’s bad for us!

5128 2018-04-10 15:57:36 Maybe, but I think at heart he's with crazy Naomi Klein. Thinks we can phase oil out in a generation.

5130 2018-04-10 15:57:34 I’m divorcing coconut oil and hooking up with olive oil. Just seems right.
5131 2018-04-10 15:57:29 @gcocregina do you guys carry Mobil 1 5w-30 synthetic? Looking for somewhere to get my oil changed
5132 2018-04-10 15:57:19 Pretty easy to see then from that assessment, that the jobs people in BC are already doing in an oil spill free environment as well the livelihood of all the creatures that depend on  an oil spill free coast are more important than the "falling knife" of a bad investment.
5133 2018-04-10 15:57:17 It will provide temporary construction jobs and profit for the oil and pipeline companies, but the general public will see very little good from it in the long term.
5134 2018-04-10 15:57:14 S/o to the kia soul for lasting 11 months without an oil change.... So sorry for the neglect but v thankful it didnt blow up
5135 2018-04-10 15:57:06 Hate coming to the dealership, be up here 5 and a half hours just for a freaking oil change..
5136 2018-04-10 15:56:59 Cooking eggs in olive oil. The sound they are making in the pan is the drum pattern of @meshuggah's Bleed - which is stuck in my head thanks to @billburr's @theMMPodcast.

@WinkB2B is proudly organizing B2B meetings again !!
This time for Moroccan  producers & exporters of extra virgin olive oil. Event taking place in Verona,  04.15.2018 - 04.18.2018
5139 2018-04-10 15:56:49 "Can I check your oil..."
5140 2018-04-10 15:56:47 Yes, mind and body are connected, of course, but your immune system is connected as well.
I hope you have success w/treatment, I haven't looked into the med. cannabis oil. I had bad luck w/steroid creams, they seem to make it spread in a larger area for me.
5141 2018-04-10 15:56:43 And Syrian oil fields are prime examples.
5142 2018-04-10 15:56:40 And there are 2.4 million miles of pipelines in this country. Makes you wonder if this one is mentioned because it is a politically hot issue, as surely the odds have to be high that problems exist w/the others that we are just not hearing about. Both parties invested in big oil.
5143 2018-04-10 15:56:38 Thank you for reaching out and I hope this message finds yourself and Miss Meep well? Please be advised Purina do not use palm oil in any feline products - Take care - Abby 
5144 2018-04-10 15:56:26 This implies sourcing from forests that are far below their maximum biomass potential, right? It sounds a little like the 'sustainable palm oil' concept ... questionable, especially when you burn fossil fuel to work the forest and transport your heavy feedstock 1000s of miles.
5145 2018-04-10 15:56:06 คือ ใกล้จบแล้วหรอ
5146 2018-04-10 15:56:06 Capline Pipeline reversal from Patoka, IL to St. James, LA in conjunction with Enbridge Line 3 expansion would be a lifeline for Canadian oil takeaway capacity and very bullish for Canadian O&G companies.
5147 2018-04-10 15:56:06 tinatamad ako bumangon para kunin yung oil para di na q lapitan ng mosquitoes
5148 2018-04-10 15:56:04 (I’d actually love to be wrong about this, shockingly I’d like to think the planet isn’t becoming inhospitable. Curious to see anything you have that shows that more oil burnt != environmental issues)
5149 2018-04-10 15:55:50 How I know when my anxiety is reaching orange-level alert: I spend 30 minutes constructing a single sentence.

There is not enough essential oil in the world for this.
5150 2018-04-10 15:55:45 You must be new to Twitter hey?...We are all armchair coaches and GM’s on here… that’s the point.  smh – right back at you

5152 2018-04-10 15:55:44 Transition to clean energy tech while refining and selling oil in Canada if you care about jobs, taxes and the economy. Think long term!
5153 2018-04-10 15:55:38 Need some more coconut oil and castor oil
5154 2018-04-10 15:55:33 Probably keeping Monopoly over oil trade, US $ reserve status. I think they don't want oil producing nation's to strengthen their hands outside dollar system.

We are committed to traceability and transparency, and only sell products containing krill oil that comes from MSC and Friends of the Sea certified sustainable 1/2
5156 2018-04-10 15:55:25 I was the email read out on the show that the biscuit aisle in Waitrose should be called the palm oil aisle! I was horrified in there yesterday so this news today is amazing!!
5157 2018-04-10 15:55:22 It's a clever marketing ploy that chooses to ignore the fact that NBPOL or Daabon produce certified deforestation free palm oil
5158 2018-04-10 15:55:20 - I need an oil change like 2 weeks ago.
5159 2018-04-10 15:55:18 Black people who vote in favor of oil pipelines that infringe on native land, for example. And like other people have mentioned, making laws isn’t the only form of power there is. I’m white, so my words don’t hold as much weight as black people on this thread...

5165 2018-04-10 15:54:43 Sat down to work while my car gets its oil changed and realize I forgot my headphones, dang it.
5166 2018-04-10 15:54:41 Anybody thinking USD sharply weaker crude oil sharply  higher by mid summer?  No?  Me neither then.
5167 2018-04-10 15:54:22 There’s work considered hazardous and states are required to pay more, like welding, road construction, heavy machinery, toxic waste, oil drilling, etc. whatever is deemed hazardous, in my field life insurance is hard to find because it’s “too hazardous” - road construction 
5168 2018-04-10 15:54:09 Taking my old coffee walk route while waiting for my oil change and I  feel so gattdang cozy.
5169 2018-04-10 15:54:07 Hi Daryl, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.

5177 2018-04-10 15:53:26 Unfortunately I ate all my olives last night, so I drank some olive oil instead. You know me... I can’t get enough of those little green bastards. It’s like I’m hooked or something.
5178 2018-04-10 15:53:22 Try roasting it with a little olive oil and a lot of sweet chilli sauce!!!
5179 2018-04-10 15:53:20 It's because you have nothing to defend it and deep down the shame and denial about what they do to those ocean waters eats away at you. Instead, You so called environmentalists focus on Oil pipelines to help you sleep at night

5195 2018-04-10 15:51:49 Have you tried using just CBD oil? It's not as effective as a CBD/THC mix, but it's still an anti-inflammatory, and it's legal in all 50 states.
5196 2018-04-10 15:51:45 What bothers me is how ppl are calling for Assad and Putin's head for "possible" chemical attacks but yet seem to forget the 10k American soldiers killed in Iraq.  Now they want anther war in Syria?  Because Assad is a "monster"? Nope it's all about the oil and power

5226 2018-04-10 15:49:40 Why do we need gasoline? To polute more or to become more lazzy.

Why do you import anything which we do not need much more rather we have it.

Oil does not required for our nation for any cause. India is getting poluted more on air due to this gasoline.
5227 2018-04-10 15:49:37 Always fascinating when the captains of the oil industry brag about their off-grid, solar-powered farms. Feels like a form of personal greenwashing.

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

5245 2018-04-10 15:48:37 And that's just gross oversimplification and rewarding big oil for inaction on builing domestic refining capacity.

Not interested in accepting that we have to pay higher pump prices because we don't refine our own product.

Give it a rest, not interested in that spin.
5246 2018-04-10 15:48:22 What a joke. You are being led bu a saudi family who sell off your own oil to the West for cheap, get rich, and leave you starving in the dirt with no rights whatsoever. Of course the West loves your kings because they rip your country off and keep you weak.

5355 2018-04-10 15:38:42 This is being 'converted' into an oil, well 16 of them...

5356 2018-04-10 15:38:35 Don’t eat wheat, dairy, or canola oil. Remove toxic mercury fillings. Drink celery or cabbage juice. Eat only avocados bananas figs mango melon papaya potato and aloe vera. Juice all day, every day. Prayers and Good luck
5357 2018-04-10 15:38:33 I think this tweet needs to be clear that @IcelandFoods are the first major UK retailer to phase out plan oil in their own products. The rest need to follow.
5358 2018-04-10 15:38:22 .@BP_plc CFO Gilvary says that we should not think in terms of #peakoil in terms of supply, but peak oil demand - something @GregorMacdonald has been saying for years. Estimates demand will plateau in the 2030-2040 range. #BNEFsummit
5359 2018-04-10 15:38:19 what is palm oil? why shouldn't you want it in your food products? We hear from John Gibbons next @lstwrd @todayfm then we discuss sleep deprivation. Apparently 80% of us suffer from it (I include myself).
5360 2018-04-10 15:38:17 That’s why you go through Charlotte and West Virginia. 

Screw Maryland.
5361 2018-04-10 15:38:14 @realDonaldTrump Mister President ! Please stop buying Venezuelan oil! Vzla is a narco dictatorship. There is corruption, there are many political prisoners, a lot of people assesinated who protested against this government. There are hunger, and a lack of medicines. A real mess!

5363 2018-04-10 15:37:59 #Vegans and those concerned with the fate of the orang-utan might be interested in this: “Iceland has concluded that removing palm oil is the only way it can offer its customers a guarantee that its products do not contain palm oil from forest destruction." Nice one @IcelandFoods
5364 2018-04-10 15:37:56 @Valvoline your customer care is horrible... My car was fine prior to the oil change and now I’m a gentleman with #ALS struggling to figure out how I would even begin to fix my car after your shitty service #NeverAgain #valvolinesucks
5365 2018-04-10 15:37:53 What do you mean by "working with the Tobacco Industry"? None of those people who wrote those articles are working with the TI. One may for example think of Big Oil companies as "the enemy" but still agree that switching from leaded to unleaded gasoline was a good move.

5375 2018-04-10 15:37:17 . @BP CFO Gilvary makes a good point to @tina_davis that Paris agreement isn't a "race to renewables" but a "race to reduce emissions," which means oil, gas will still play a role

5379 2018-04-10 15:37:07 U need to inform CDN's of Bill  C-69 which hits a pipeline’s GHG emissions, up/down stream but exempts  imported oil and so confers huge advantage on our competitors. Add that  to the 'landlock' discount on CDN oil ... Liberal disaster, but U don't say much at all.

5389 2018-04-10 15:36:29 I didn't say they invaded Iraq because of AQ. I said they invaded Iraq because Saddam represented a threat to American power in the region (including the oil supply). So they decided to install a government more favourable to their interests.
5390 2018-04-10 15:36:10 Right?!?! Importing oil does not reduce global gas emissions. It only shifts them to other countries who don't have the same environmental standards as Canada.

5394 2018-04-10 15:36:04 Well done @IcelandFoods for the ban on palm oil. Such a pointless, unnecessary and environmentally damaging ingredient.
5395 2018-04-10 15:36:03 If you find that your hair has split ends, you may want to try using a hot oil treatment.
5396 2018-04-10 15:35:57 Apparently my sweet tooth exacerbates my already oily skin...I'll buy blotting paper or sell the excess oil to a petrochemical plant. I'm not giving up sweets!
5397 2018-04-10 15:35:52 May be Turkana as the community in the process of victimization should stop production of oil. We can not be sidelined for almost 60yrs then even when we feel God has remembered and seen our suffering someone just takes it when we have sat and about to take a bite

I'm sure that's what you meant.

2- do you support Canada above all other countries?
3- if Canada DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY today, what would be the effect on climate change?
4- planet was ok at 8,000 ppm CO2, did you know?

5421 2018-04-10 15:33:28 Alas, there are more jobs in renewables than fracking, LNG and Site C. Can we agree Alberta squandered their resources unlike say, Norway? Big Oil is not our friend. Their only raison d'etre is shareholder wealth, not protecting our coastline or env.
5422 2018-04-10 15:33:09 Oil 'em up, lock and load.

5427 2018-04-10 15:32:57 Glad you got your profits. I got pulled into an all day emergency meeting Friday and had to carry over the weekend. That didn’t work out too well for me!  so a longer elephant ride to profitability. What’s going on with FE? Are we in an up cycle now?

5442 2018-04-10 15:31:44 The reality is that oil is a finite resource; we can't use it as fuel forever. An alert PM would know his citizenry enough to know that it's not just leftists that want a reduction in oil usage, but it's only the left that wants it without alternatives in place. That's crazy.

5466 2018-04-10 15:29:36 I agree with you, but while we are waiting for everyone to do that, sustainable oil palm changes production from the source. We already have in excess of 18million hectares of plantation which must be turned over to sustainable production to meet demands.
5467 2018-04-10 15:29:30 RIP to our Turkana oil wells
5468 2018-04-10 15:29:24 Just to get a sense of scale, how many Iceland own brand products contain palm oil?  Out of a total own brand product range of? How many non-own brand products stocked contain palm oil? Out of total non brand products stocked?
5469 2018-04-10 15:29:18 ...over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable.  We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Reid 2/2
5470 2018-04-10 15:29:17 Please be assured we are committed to sourcing with integrity. Our Sustainability Plan commits us to sourcing our palm oil sustainably and ensuring our own brand products don’t contribute to global deforestation. By the end of 2016...1/2

5487 2018-04-10 15:27:53 You're just talking past me. Not interested in supporting the raw export of unrefined product at the expense of building refining capacity domestically. That is economics 101. No sense in rewarding big oil for not building capacity here.
5488 2018-04-10 15:27:48 Is that oil?
5489 2018-04-10 15:27:43 Same here but not to worry I'm currently making palm oil rice for us
5490 2018-04-10 15:27:41 ** help stop deforestation by stop using Palm Oil **
5491 2018-04-10 15:27:35 Of course they’re chemicals. Oil is composed of chemicals, too. Human beings are, too. But it was never designed to be used as a chemical WEAPON. There is a HUGE difference.
5492 2018-04-10 15:27:33 Outside of Texas and a few urban centers in some of the other states, his map divides the most economically productive states (blue) with the least economically productive states (red). Your "red state utopia" is already bankrupt. I mean, he gave us Dakota oil. SAD!
5493 2018-04-10 15:27:32 My body does not respond well to palm oil & it's in virtually all pre-prepared foods, just check the labels, you'll be astounded.  It's a saturated oil & bad for health & the world. #boycottpalmoilproducts
5494 2018-04-10 15:27:23 This pipeline is not in BC's interests, it is not in the national interest, it is not in the best interests of the planet.

It is in the best interests of multi-national oil, which cares less about Canada and Canadians.
5495 2018-04-10 15:27:23 I would make sure to use a face mask that will moisturize your dry parts and take out oil from the oily parts (like your T-zone probably) at least every two weeks. (2/2)
5496 2018-04-10 15:27:21 If you liked Aerospace & Defense returns the last 10 years as we exported weapons you are going to LOVE Oil & Gas the next 10 years as we ramp and export domestic production.
5497 2018-04-10 15:27:19 all I want to do is be laid up and give massages and be kissed on and cook for someone and oil they scalped and leave my scent behind on their pillows so they remember me and shit
5498 2018-04-10 15:27:02 I was just being picky my hair doesn’t look that bad, I will rewash at the end of the week, I’m just trying to look fresh for this birth  coconut oil and fresh locs
5499 2018-04-10 15:26:50 The current price of Heating Oil is $2.399 per gallon.
5500 2018-04-10 15:26:50 Trump repealed the regulation requiring oil & gas companies to divulge payments to foreign officials, i.e. bribes.
5501 2018-04-10 15:26:50 Never a dull moment when you’re waiting for an oil change and the lady next to you is knitting a blanket.

5505 2018-04-10 15:26:34 Political instability? Trump has adopted the entire neocon anti-Russia policy more than Obama. Bombed Syria, removed diplomats, sold weapons to Ukraine, killed Exxon-Ru oil deal, kept troops on Ru border, imposed sanctions.
5506 2018-04-10 15:26:33 In the last 10 days I did not see a single article over Electric Cars... Shale Oil Revolution.... Falling Oil Demand.... Energy from Air.... or anything bearish. Why???? Shall we sell the hell out???? | #oil #energy #oott

5512 2018-04-10 15:25:50 Just FYI, palm oil produced sustainably doesn’t impact the environment negatively. Read about RSPO and their restrictions on palm oil production.
5513 2018-04-10 15:25:27 .... ya insides frying  like hot oil I bet lol

5515 2018-04-10 15:25:03 Funny you mentioned Iraq and libya. We were just talking about that at work. Those two situations had one thing  in common. The leaders wanted oil to be traded differently. Have a cousin in the oil industry. His opinion was, knowing about WMDs, like I do, predicted Lybia.

5519 2018-04-10 15:24:50 I never buy anything with palm oil in.
5520 2018-04-10 15:24:46 Why does #Nigeria make noise about the arrival of petrol shipments? Isn't it shameful for a major crude oil producing nation to be unable to refine the commodity and resort to imports to meet its fuel requirements? Don't our leaders have any shame?

5522 2018-04-10 15:24:29 I wondered this morning whether the "Vancouver" Sun might for once refrain from running an editorial pimping for the oil industry and might instead say something in support of its presumed readership, ie British Columbians, in the current dispute.  Nope.
5523 2018-04-10 15:24:27 We have considered sustainable palm oil & recognise that the movement is working in good faith, but we believe its progress has been too slow to address the widespread issues around palm oil production. The only way to really tackle these problems is to limit the palm oil demand.
5524 2018-04-10 15:24:23 PS. Colloidal silver and oregano oil cured my past flu’s almost immediately.

5529 2018-04-10 15:24:11 I think we should vote on this as a province before bailing out #KinderMorgan. We voted for the NDP to cut some oil relationship and not to become an oil pipeline owner. Please don't make us regret voting for NDP. #ableg #abpoli
5530 2018-04-10 15:24:04 It is beyond my comprehension how ANYONE thinks that importing 650,000 barrels of dirty "conflict" oil into Canada every week is, in any way, acceptable?
5531 2018-04-10 15:23:34 I don’t think make up is supposed to sit on yals face like a layer of oil pastel... right?
5532 2018-04-10 15:23:31 The process is a sham! That's the point I was trying to make. I don't agree that this is in National interest, because it's just simply not needed. We could do so much more and better if we wanted to. Renewables creates more jobs than oil. There's a case 4 supply side change here
5533 2018-04-10 15:23:18 I've started checking for palm oil every product I buy!!!

5547 2018-04-10 15:21:37 The US will never take Saudi Arabia to task as long as they are dependent on them for oil. In fact the main reason they invaded Iraq was because he was a potential threat to their allies which includes Saudi Arabia.

5549 2018-04-10 15:21:28 It’s showing how much oil is in a drop of these products & how it compares with the brand’s claim. For example, the “stay matte” foundation has almost as much oil as the “always luminous” foundationAlso, people with sensitive skin tend to avoid excess oil so this helps a little
5550 2018-04-10 15:21:21 Put a pipeline in   The Skeena river will be screwed in ten years if we transport oil by rail  . Shit cn can’t keep the coal out of the river . Can you imagine if a oil train falls off the tracks?  And we think there’s a shortage of salmon now
5551 2018-04-10 15:21:21 By getting palm oil it causes deforestation and many animals die bc they lose their home

5559 2018-04-10 15:20:33 This is all bs. The United States has no vested interest in Syria. The Globalists want Assad out so they can build an oil pipeline to Europe in order to diminish the revenue Russia obtains from selling oil to Europe.
5560 2018-04-10 15:19:55 While we were, and still are, fighting on Transmountain and killed Energy East, Russia became a significant exporter of Oil and LNG. The world will not wait for us. We are loosing big time.

5578 2018-04-10 15:18:13 So you do think that Shetland deserves the right to self determination if Scotland becomes independent. Good to hear, then Shetland can use all its revenue from oil and fisheries for the gullible daft poor islanders. Then Shetlanders will become rich Islander

5580 2018-04-10 15:17:56 I mean this in the best way possible, what's wrong with palm oil?
5581 2018-04-10 15:17:50 Quality over quantity with followers. Unless you are positioning yourself to sell snake oil to low quality people.
5582 2018-04-10 15:17:43 reminded me of a 90's ad... dhara cooking oil..'Jalebiiiiii?'... the boy in that ad left home and sat wit same expressions...
5583 2018-04-10 15:17:42 That's not what's happening. This is obviously going nowhere. Planned maintenance is just that - planned maintenance. If one knows there will be a constriction in supply for a period of time, they bank up product to withstand the disruption. Big oil's model rewards NOT doing that
5584 2018-04-10 15:17:36 I find @IcelandFoods fascinating - from #retail obscurity to leading the sector on toughest issues (plastic and palm oil). My bet is that it pays off commercially in years to come.

5600 2018-04-10 15:15:52 Alaskans own 1,843,489 shares of PTT PCL, worth $20,761,884. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in THAILAND.
5601 2018-04-10 15:15:51 As facial oil. I mix dgn my moisturizer sometimes
5602 2018-04-10 15:15:48 Hahaha! I laugh to keep from crying!! Who knew you need an Oil Filter Wrench to take a toilet apart? BTW if you ever need an oil filter wrench, i'm your girl!
5603 2018-04-10 15:15:44 I read it, it’s nonsensical and obvious to anyone whose worked in Oil Marketing that it’s misleading the general public. The producer pays the tolls. If you had a sniff on how oil and gas worked you’d never post a National Observer article like that.
5604 2018-04-10 15:15:44 alot of supermarkets are saying they are now sourcing sustainable palm oil? HOW? im bit suspect about that. btw i avoid it at all costs
5605 2018-04-10 15:15:44 “Iceland to drop Palm Oil from its own-brand products”. Another example of misguided political correctness which threatens agricultural employment in developing countries.
5606 2018-04-10 15:15:42 Yeah and Syrian oil flow has slowed as a result.  Stop with fake news

5641 2018-04-10 15:12:14 .@ElizabethMay read that you think getting ab oil to new markets is not in cad's best interest. How do you justify that? Current markets are no longer reliable and we cant go cold turkey off oil without a recession. The income is neccesary to diversify.

5683 2018-04-10 15:09:13 Why is it, that all corporations are so evil. It's a pretty simplistic way to look at things. I have worked in Oil and Gas for a long time.

5685 2018-04-10 15:09:06 Don’t understand why wind is a target. It makes sense to incentivize the expansion of an energy and revenue source that is renewable. Also, oil brings in more taxable revenue in one year than wind does over multiple years. At the very least have come gains and ad valorem on both.

5694 2018-04-10 15:08:01 Hi Maria, the replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard 
5695 2018-04-10 15:07:59 I generally consider that if a car requires a hand pump to change the motor oil that it is *not* well thought out.
5696 2018-04-10 15:07:54 Where will you get your food and oil?
5697 2018-04-10 15:07:41 I should have said more Integrity than Pelosi & Warren.

I didn't say that Maddie was smart.

Iraqi sanctions weren't killing children. Saddam Hussein rejecting oil for food is just one example of  how his policies where responsible for humanitarian crisis in Iraq, not sanctions.
5698 2018-04-10 15:07:37 Israel has the most to loose from international support of the war disappearing. Occupied Golan Heights and all. As well as Big Oil with their pipelines.
5699 2018-04-10 15:07:35 I was told explicitly by @IAR_updates that no palm oil is sustainable
5700 2018-04-10 15:07:30 If I may. Triumph Motorcycles are notorious for leaking oil. One idea could have to do with taking a Triumph into a mechanic to fix the oil leak but it not leaking on that particular day. I love bad punchlines. And bad jokes.
5701 2018-04-10 15:07:27 I’ve been waiting for oil to heat up for the longest time  (forgot to turn the burner on)
5702 2018-04-10 15:07:26 Again, whom is friends with whom is incidental to the calculus of state power; in the capitalist paradigm, oil is power.
5703 2018-04-10 15:07:25 If rising demand causes oil prices to rise, the spike in oil prices before each recession just means that every recession was preceded by an expansion. Not saying that a spike in oil prices couldn't cause a recession just that your statistic may not be that conclusive evidence.
5704 2018-04-10 15:07:24 Thank you for the response but, as @IcelandFoods (and many others) have shown, there is no such thing as 'sustainable palm oil.' The only option is to cut it out of products entirely. Which *is* possible.

5713 2018-04-10 15:06:56 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
5714 2018-04-10 15:06:44 Please block all gas coming through Alberta from BC. Use the same tactics that BC is using. Make BC prove that all chemicals have been removed from the completion process. Let’s see how fast BC move as we shut down thier revenue from thier oil and gas industry
5715 2018-04-10 15:06:39 I'm absolutely against the damage of the rainforest and have undertaken many studies into this. Playing Devil's advocate wouldn't it be better to insist on usage of sustainable palm oil rather than elimination so the farming communities who rely on palm oil....

5758 2018-04-10 15:04:01 I always take my makeup off with coconut oil because it will literally melt it right off especially eye makeup.

She's been off meds for four months now -- first time in 40 years w/o pain meds...

5769 2018-04-10 15:03:00 Great news! Iceland, the leading retailer of frozen food has decided to eliminate palm oil from all of its own brand products from the end of this year. This action has been taken in response to the catastrophic effects of deforestation by palm oil producers.
5770 2018-04-10 15:03:00 Mr president ,Enyi Oma 1 of Ndi Igbo has made Anambra State an Oil Producing State.

5807 2018-04-10 15:00:13 Oil - the commodity that shaped the last half of the 20th century in a 'burn it as fast as you can' economic model - is facing ethical and environmental resistance in Western Canada.

5874 2018-04-10 14:51:56 A lot of aim investors haven’t seen a big oil story and in there probably lies some of the surprise upside. It’s not just wildcat success people price in pre drill it’s the huge value increase of a significant acreage position.

5876 2018-04-10 14:51:54 It takes a while! It feels gross and you feel like you’re doing more damage, but it softens up what’s in your ear over time and should melt it! I warm up the olive oil in the microwave a little bit sometimes which helps better - the docs will recommend to use olive oil too!

5878 2018-04-10 14:51:46 Thanks.  Not a thing in there about Palm Oil though.  It seems to be primarily about cost saving, as a by-product of energy efficiency, plus a plastic bag policy.  Beyond that you seem to have little or nothing on environmental impact, especially the wider environment.

5889 2018-04-10 14:50:45 Our corporations will not be safe until we have military bases in all 194 countries. We are only at 70. Our currency will not be safe til we control all the oil reserves. If humans would just sacrifice more, we can increase the military budget to a TRILLION.
5890 2018-04-10 14:50:37 So, now USA will accept a new oil contract with Qatar, if you just ignore the major lack of Human Rights, not to mention Human Rights as a woman in that country.

5892 2018-04-10 14:50:15 If Oil really goes here,  it is extremely bullish for some stocks,  but bearish for a few others.  Give that some thought.

5898 2018-04-10 14:49:57 Blair: the values of many petrostates with national oil companies, who dominate the oil market, are not the interests and values of the United States. Most of them aren't on our Christmas card list.

5900 2018-04-10 14:49:35 It’s sad. It’s worse in some states. The plastic / oil lobby is huge. We passed a plastic bag ban here and they are still fighting it
5901 2018-04-10 14:49:33 Excuse me, Kamala Harris is a Cop, but don't you realize that we are "defending democracy and freedom"? Hell's bells!! It's our DUTY to sacrifice our youth for the oil and gas underground in the Golan Heights( for the profit of a very few!!).
5902 2018-04-10 14:49:33 When I was getting a sew in or box braids I’d wash my hair first lol. Mainly because I wanted to oil it the way I like it so it grows
5903 2018-04-10 14:49:32 Very good initiative but it's subject to whatever ingredient replaces palm oil. If the replacement product isn't environmental sourced where's the gain?

5909 2018-04-10 14:49:19 Clearly, the risk is too great. Renewable energy can offset this madness. Wind and solar energy is here every day all the way to the tar-sands and further. It will create many more jobs than oil. More dependable, less destructive.

5920 2018-04-10 14:48:15 Why didn't Alberta have a hissy fit over Energy East?  It makes more sense. Replace imported oil with domestic, don't cross major mountain range, steer clear of Fraser, there are already oil tankers bringing oil in, so less worry from residents.
5921 2018-04-10 14:48:13 Time to squish squash my mouth with coconut oil..hopefully getting healthier and whiter teeth..
5922 2018-04-10 14:48:07 am i meant to feel less blocked after?? i just did the olive oil method which involved pouring it into my ear and i feel more blocked now. fail..

5924 2018-04-10 14:47:53 I can advise to start immediately taking CBD oil from Holland and Barrett. It's amazing..do research and buy a bottle I think is 20 quid. U can thank me later.

5937 2018-04-10 14:46:45 No. The employee asked the manager if I could get any discount for not being told of a 2 hour wait.  Manager said no. I left with no oil change. I had lots of things to do yesterday, spending more than 2 hours at the store was not one of them.

5962 2018-04-10 14:44:49 American media has always been a sucker for a two-bit snake oil salesman "preachin' the gospel." Problem is, they always turn out to be two-bit hustlers with no values, no integrity, and no moral compass who really don't know much. And sometimes they have offspring just like them
5963 2018-04-10 14:44:47 "Less necessary"? This is a 15 billion$ boost to Canada. Getting full market value for our oil is a must.
5964 2018-04-10 14:44:44 bottom line: people who need energy WILL FIND AND USE IT. If not our oil it will be from someone else.  If not oil it will be gas, if not gas - coal.  Climate change will be addressed only after a better alternative exits to economically meet the needs of the developing world
5965 2018-04-10 14:44:35 First, you pour some oil into the pan, 
Then you add some milk and tea leaves and let it boil for a while, 
Finally, add it to the batter and enjoy!

5969 2018-04-10 14:44:25 The oil is going to make its way there regardless. Now do you want it transported in a proven safe system (pipeline) or sharing your roads with it in tanker trucks and having it transported in the far more risky rail system
5970 2018-04-10 14:44:25 Lmaooooooo I was deadass about to say what oil?
5971 2018-04-10 14:44:20 Tony Robbins is another snake oil salesman, like all preachers. A lot of platitudes and just common sense stuff that people could figure out for themselves. Preys on the vulnerable who give him their heard-earned money.

5984 2018-04-10 14:43:07 Besides, only BC and Ontario can't refine finished product to fuel their own provinces. There is a pipeline that splines off KM to Wash, where AB oil is refined and sold back mostly to BC.
5985 2018-04-10 14:42:58 Everything the government agrees or disagrees to affects crude oil production. Agree there are no direct limits but there are significant indirect controls that limit production. Examples pipelines, federal lands etc.
5986 2018-04-10 14:42:54 Greatest curse for any nation is to have a consistent government for 16yrs with oil boom and can't boast of 100 km of good roads, 10000mwt, and reserve depletion

6011 2018-04-10 14:41:46 I'm under no illusion that any of this is humanitiarian. But I think it's more strategic (hence Cuban missile crisis reference) than about natural resources (oil). The issue is only tangentially about Israel.

6015 2018-04-10 14:41:39 Yep, taking the risk with public money doesn't make the risk of BC blocking shipments through it go away. What happened to all the lefties who complain about subsidizing the oil industry and the whole privatize-profit/socialize-losses thing?

6022 2018-04-10 14:41:16 Canadians cannot be martyrs for the environment.  The world needs these resources and our economy should be able to benefit from it.

6029 2018-04-10 14:40:41 Thank you. Right now, we don’t believe verifiably ‘sustainable’ palm oil is available in the mass market, so we are giving consumers a choice for the first time. Until Iceland can guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction, we are simply saying ‘no to palm oil’.

6043 2018-04-10 14:39:27 Yes, there are regulations about drilling, where you can drill, getting a license, probably what screws you are allowed to use. Most oil exports were banned until 2 years ago. There have even been price controls. But there are NO limits on the amount of oil a company can produce

How you see Alberta oil as worse is ludicrous. Do some homework. A foreign funded vocal minority is destroying Canada. Jail them and build it.

6089 2018-04-10 14:35:29 It's a completely different critter. It's not really a vinaigrette, I mean, it kind of is, but it's a bacon fat base instead of oil, and you'd better cook the onions well. It's more like a potato and bacon side dish, than a traditional creamy potato salad.

6091 2018-04-10 14:35:21 I would restrict BC gas and oil from crossing our border. It is time that BC realized that all of their OIl and Gas resources are filtering through our infrastructure to market. Put incentives out for Alberta Companies to replace BC oil and Gas in our gathering system.

6094 2018-04-10 14:34:31 Then maybe what u r referencing is being spun by coconut oil, groundnut oil companies now? Don't get fooled by scrutiny of the facts being done. Its good they r doing it. But its very early to deny that LDL is a contributing factor in CAD, MI, Sroke etc...
6095 2018-04-10 14:34:25 How about the low price of oil? Alberta oil is not a good investment right now with the low price, and if alternative energy continues to flourish the price may never go back up! That's good for consumers!
6096 2018-04-10 14:34:25 Yet you use oil and gas plus all products made from them everyday.

6128 2018-04-10 14:31:09 Thanks for the response - Iceland's commitment to sustainability is fantastic. I'm curious to know why the total ban and not a move towards sustainable palm oil? Transparency? And are the impacts of the alternatives much lower? What about the producers - are they all bad?

6144 2018-04-10 14:28:52 It's about the source, not the product itself surely? There are sustainably-sourced palm oil producers out there, as there are soy. Dig into the rice, quinoa and other grain industries, and you'll find cruelty there too. All the more reason to research what your $'s funding.

6151 2018-04-10 14:28:17 in other words there is no point to joining OPEC unless you can control the oil production. Only way to control the oil is to pass a law to allow it. It would then take years to pass through the courts etc. so in other words what would the point be of joining?

6153 2018-04-10 14:28:12 The mess is in large part Trudeau's doing.

6159 2018-04-10 14:27:38 My way is to use herbal syrups or pastes as shampoo & soaps of different qualities for different applications. Neither oil nor alkali is needed. Different formulas for different circumstances of skin or hair and also for different material, e.g. bison hide, wool, cotton, silk etc
6160 2018-04-10 14:27:37 I have a few at the moment. It all depends on what my skin is doing at the moment. If I am having oil issues and want to help with anti-aging  I use @tarabusicreek Ocean Mist Mask,  if I’m feeling dry I use Mary’s Clay Mask.  But, if I need to clarify I use Origins Charcoal Mask
6161 2018-04-10 14:27:29 Yes Alberta is landlocked. Perhaps people should read up on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. No way PM Socks will pull out of that when he is too worried about not getting his seat on the UN Security Council. Separation WILL get our oil to port.

6163 2018-04-10 14:27:10 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
6164 2018-04-10 14:27:06 Hi Christian,  Our team is fully committed in honouring our pledges. Plus, we’ve already put the wheels in motion to remove palm oil from our own label products by the end of the year.

6176 2018-04-10 14:26:09 Unregulated oil refineries spewing pollution because there is no internalisation of external costs, is the data-is-oil,is-it-shite metaphor you seek. An American refiner would expect to be regulated in each country of operation.

6182 2018-04-10 14:25:46 The US gov could technically join OPEC (if OPEC let it in) because the gov can sign any treaties, etc that it wants.

6184 2018-04-10 14:25:38 Again, I'd have t go through the underlying content. Anti-Zionist is not anti-semitic. Zionism is a form of racism.

6199 2018-04-10 14:24:00 Well when drying ur hair drying with a t shirt or soft towel is better than a rough one helps. I have really dry hair so coconut oil on the ends helps too, not too much though. I haven’t really got any for styling though.

Price of oil just jumped. How convenient.
6218 2018-04-10 14:21:58 @SenFeinstein Mark Zuckerberg knew what was happening. He acknowledges that.. Shouldn't he pay a huge fine. Oil companies when they spill they pay billions in fines plus the cleanup. Same scenario.
6219 2018-04-10 14:21:58 We're actually mostly known for Salmon and oil, but who cares. Our leaders never caved to the enemy, by the way. They fled due to overwhelming force from Germany and in cooperation with England led the resistance fight from there.

6224 2018-04-10 14:21:18 That’s not even more oil, the same oil your rag of a paper said was running out during the referendum. Wouldn’t wipe my arse with the hootsman for fear of catching something nasty.

6240 2018-04-10 14:20:17 Yes it's a real divergence. What do you think of arguments from those such as @RaoulGMI that point to high speculative USD shorts & long Oil positions, and Fed QT as USD bull catalysts? Is it just different timing? Near-term deflation, but long-term hyper-inflation bc insolvency?
6241 2018-04-10 14:20:14 It’s another US vs Russia warm war. Russia Iran support Assad - Russia wants naval base, Iran wants a client state next door, Turkey hates the Kurds, Saudis hate Iran - OIL. Israel scared of Iranian dominance -UK likes weapons sales.
6242 2018-04-10 14:20:11 reality is: we still depend on oil, no alternatives in place yet to replace it. BC does too, was just there. Next to their mill $ house prices, traffic increased tremendously, no electric cars anywhere!

6248 2018-04-10 14:19:50 National Observer? C-mon man, that defies supply economics. Prices lower as supply increases. Want cheaper gas, less reliant on US oil barged from Alaska to Washington, build the line
6249 2018-04-10 14:19:50 OMG used to have this problem! I’d go to Pepboys every week to buy a quart. Turns out there’s an issue with the burning up of oil and you can get it fixed! They’ll try to make you pay for labor but don’t fall for it.
6250 2018-04-10 14:19:49 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

6264 2018-04-10 14:18:40 One can’t ignore the role of technological innovation over time. This was left out of calculations about peak oil 15+ years ago. But prices forced/enabled progress in shale technology,  lowering extraction costs. There are huge incentives to make decentralization more efficient.

6313 2018-04-10 14:15:08 You massage just under the ear opening where your lobe sits with your neck, that just helps the oil free up the wax
6314 2018-04-10 14:15:06 WHY?

according to the Labour and Tory parties our oil is worthless!

More to the point all this about NEW fields being found is a LIE!

Ever since oil was discovered WE have been told by the Tories and Labour that our oil is running OUT!

• 1/4 olive oil
6342 2018-04-10 14:13:22 Day 1 no dairy has begun and I woke up craving cream cheese. Instead I made scrambled eggs (didn’t even use butter in the pan, olive oil instead) and toast. Success is not putting cheese on those eggs and simultaneously realizing dairy is my life 
6343 2018-04-10 14:13:15 There's so much hatred in the body of Christ. I really don't understand why well maybe I do...... smh it gots to get better! Where there's no unity, there's no OIL!
6344 2018-04-10 14:13:03 I think it will prove to be sound and fury... signifying nothing.  He will probably take the castor oil and apologize, and do a lot of agreeing.
6345 2018-04-10 14:12:59 Questions from the audience - what is the scale of the oil theft problem, where are statistics for interdictions? @ImRalby - pretty limited sources for comprehensive statistics, but lists a few sources (many mentioned in report footnotes). #ACEnergy
6346 2018-04-10 14:12:59 Be patient mayn, you gotta do the lie on side of head for 10 minutes with oil in, then release the oil and keep lying on the side of the head!! Don’t use buds or it’ll reblock it

6350 2018-04-10 14:12:15 I totally agree. Net long speculative position on oil is at an all time high. of course this number could still go higher but if you get a catalyst oil could rapidly sell off
6351 2018-04-10 14:12:14 I always see v v attractive men when I look like I've dipped my entire head into a bucket of oil
6352 2018-04-10 14:12:12 The oil price increase helped save money both ECA and foreign reserve.

6353 2018-04-10 14:12:11 Isn’t the whole argument from Horgan to let the courts decide? Wouldn’t that be the definition of The Rule of Law?

And isn’t it in the national interest to not encourage climate change by providing more oil?

It’s like we’re drug dealers. We know it’s bad but gotta feed the kids

6386 2018-04-10 14:09:33 The industrial revolution didn’t even happen until the mid 1700’s and crude oil wasn’t discovered until 1859. Before then humans used some coal but very little compared with fossil fuels we’ve been using since 1859.
6387 2018-04-10 14:09:29 contains palm oil which increases deforestation!
6388 2018-04-10 14:09:03 Wow, i agree with TC on this issue. Let’s not forget this war in this region started with the rightwing chicken hawks, and PNAC. It has more to do with who controls the oil and not terrorism. We feed the fire selling billions of weapons to the Saudis and billions in aid to Israel

6433 2018-04-10 14:04:14 hell Labour and their bosses the Tories have been telling US that OUR oil is running ever since we first discovered the bloody stuff and yet almost on an annual basis we keep finding MORE of the bloody stuff! 
6434 2018-04-10 14:04:12 Some articles say canola is GMO and toxic. It’s really hard to choose which oil to use. Palm is bad for the environment. Olive oil good but not for cooking. Different opinions everywhere.

6449 2018-04-10 14:03:08 the lock on our front door started sticking last year and I was like "whelp, we need to buy a new front door" and my wife said "let's try putting some oil on the lock first" and she was right
6450 2018-04-10 14:03:01 Yup.  It’s about 9500 miles between changes.  It’s either pay for engine work (I think upgraded rings and pistons) or travel with oil.   (Known issue)

Funny thing is... I actually had to have an oil stick installed.  The digital guage was constantly restting with each top up.

6458 2018-04-10 14:02:34 Hi Stephen, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage the rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard

6469 2018-04-10 14:01:24 Take notice other supermarkets! A palm oil boycott by all UK supermarkets should occur for health reasons as well as environmental. Palm oil is incredibly bad for you per @TheBHF eating for heart health guidelines. @Tesco @Morrisons @sainsburys @asda @IcelandFoods @coopuk
6470 2018-04-10 14:01:19 Norway has limited access to its Wealth Fund by design. In the recent oil crash they cut education and health spending. The nats conflate wealth with cash flow.
6471 2018-04-10 14:01:17 Dear Ms. May,

How will we ever make any progress on *starting* to reducing our emissions and reliance on oil if even as climate change starts to bite, we cannot agree that increasing oil production is counter productive? 

Signed,

6472 2018-04-10 14:01:17 You have a habit to accredit yourself by just speaking. Provide incentives to them. Why did Reliance replace Indian Oil for supply of Diesel to Railways?

6478 2018-04-10 14:00:43 1- of course it can. The old "doesn't float" is a lie.
2- right beside the existing one. What's your point?
3- world demand for oil is increasing. Is it ok for other countries to profit while increasing GHG, but just not Canada?
Btw, CO2 is not a pollutant, just so you know.

6507 2018-04-10 13:58:27 Reasons to boycott Palm Oil 
• it’s heavy contribution to deforestation
• it’s driving orangutans to extinction

• the industry has questionable human rights
• not a healthy source of fat

6532 2018-04-10 13:56:28 He best idea is to leave the toxic substance in the ground. We've witnessed the devastating that oil has brought to people, animals and our environment. There is no useful purpose for a highly toxic and deadly product.

6543 2018-04-10 13:55:43 I doubt they know anything except the slogans on the SNP Grievo App, so probably not. I am bullish on the oil industry and believe it has another 40 years with new technology but the tax stream is expected to be relatively modest. It is unlikely to cover our fiscal gap IMO.

This further demonstrates a direct collision course with a US policy that uses USD reserve status as a weapon globally, IMO.
6582 2018-04-10 13:52:53 Future is not oil got that. Future is not pouring trillions of $ to the Middle East if we can keep the money here for u and all Americans until a viable alternative energy source is found. Not that hard to figure out.

6587 2018-04-10 13:52:25 They have screwed over the oil companies for 10 years s now, how do you effect change, you kill the job market and the politicians are going to be voted out, simple supply and demand, these new politicians are too woke to understand though, bye bye
6588 2018-04-10 13:52:24 @Uber_Support I received notification that Uber oil change service was still in tact. Now I am told by my service tech that you are no longer providing this as a benefit. When did this change and why did you choose to not notify anyone?

6596 2018-04-10 13:51:42 @IcelandFoods I commend you for your action on palm oil. Thank you. Let’s hope this is the start of something across the sector.

6607 2018-04-10 13:51:18 It helps and it's going to help pay the Uk's Brexit bill and gives leverage to their plans for the City's future,Scotland's identity is been enveloped into UK plc, hence Union flags appearing on Scottish products but you're right oil is not the answer.

6728 2018-04-10 13:39:56 Probably the scariest image in the Quran:

We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.
6729 2018-04-10 13:39:42 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
6730 2018-04-10 13:39:35 @rachelnpr you seem to be confused about US involvement in Syria. It’s about regime change and oil. #NoMoreWar #GetOutOfSyria #corruption #warmongering #NotBuyingIt #propaganda

6732 2018-04-10 13:38:54 The goal is not even to destabilise, it is only to control the resources (oil, minerals, metals...) and keep selling weaponry. They only care about business, not other humans.

baka di talaga naga chicken oil ang jo's dito?
6734 2018-04-10 13:38:42 I guess u missed ur shot. And for someone who is so against oil, you sure demand a lot of things that require it, like the electronics your using 2 tweet. How many things in ur life that you make joyful use of require oil? If ur not willing to answer that, then this convo is over
6735 2018-04-10 13:38:29 For that Gold/Oil charts should give a hint.
6736 2018-04-10 13:38:22 It gets better BP have announced great news! The UK has 2 new oil fields in the North Sea.
6737 2018-04-10 13:38:01 We don't want sustainable palm oil! We would like to see ethical, sustainable alternatives to palm oil. Come on, you need to move with the times and say #nopalmoil 
6738 2018-04-10 13:38:00 I’m pretty sure coconut oil cures everything.

6749 2018-04-10 13:37:02 Not all NOCs are like that. Suggest taking a look at @ValerieMarcel “Oil Titans” for a really great look at the similarities & diffs between certain national oil companies
6750 2018-04-10 13:37:01 I noticed in a lot of @GordonRamsay cooking videos he cooks steaks in a pan with olive oil versus a charcoal grill. I wonder what benefits this gives or if a pan is just faster in a sense of food service?
6751 2018-04-10 13:36:59 This is so true but I wouldn't stop there. They are also viewed as not 'educated' or 'worldly'. "Anyone can colour things in, you've just got a really easy job". Some businesses don't realise that creatives are as important as oil in an engine to keep a business moving forwards.
6752 2018-04-10 13:36:57 Oh no not again, and oil has 'only' hit $70 today with extraction cost down to around $12 ish per barrel. What are the oil companies going to do now that they make more per barrell at that price than they did at $100

6768 2018-04-10 13:35:38 Hi Dani. The replacement oil is different for different products. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard. The substitute oils that Iceland will use will be ones from suppliers who have sourced them reliably – and also sustainably 
6769 2018-04-10 13:35:35 So what time today does @realDonaldTrump attack Syria? #distraction #oil
6770 2018-04-10 13:35:34 The future is not oil, got that, say it with me, "The future is not oil"...have you been watching as other countries have been creating better ways to do everything while we're stuck in the past. Example; Netherlands produces more food per sq foot...we are behind in every sector.

6802 2018-04-10 13:32:28 Buying and storing commodities is a great way to shift reserves out of USD, a store of wealth... and the Chinese are terrified by the Japanese oil shortage/dependence on West in the run up to WW2... we may continue to see builds here and more US exports.

6806 2018-04-10 13:32:02 Chips are not just a tasty snack. Fat, oil, and the chemicals in potato (or other) chips make them a perfect fire-starting material. It’s not just Kurkure that burns, the chips your mom made at home, they can burn too.

6809 2018-04-10 13:31:56 Anyone know whether it is OK, or not, when cleaning paint brushes (using oil based paint for exterior woodwork) with white spirit, to let a bit of the soapy water used to wash it off down the drain? Or is even that tiny amount doing damage to the water courses etc it flows into?
6810 2018-04-10 13:31:50 I forgot the name of it but there is this nice oil like stuff I use on the ends of mine and it’s helped a lot with making my hair have less dead ends

6813 2018-04-10 13:31:20 Overthrowing Saddam Hussein has worked out so well for the US & the Iraqis.

6823 2018-04-10 13:30:40 I believe it was the other way around .. Butts convinced Trudeau to run so Butts could pursue his vision of eliminating oil/gas exploration from the face of Canada.
6824 2018-04-10 13:30:35 I think we need to wreck the planet more before governments and corporations actually do something and change their ways. It's the only way. Not everyone will go vegan and vegans still buy products with palm oil.

6831 2018-04-10 13:30:02 @CNNPolitics The only way to penalize Russia's exactions in Syria is cut off their oil sales to the rest of the world by using the military budget ie:$40M per Scud strike and give a 10% rebate on oil contracts and cut off Russia's oligarchs

6860 2018-04-10 13:27:30 And it took you this long to just state $29.9B? Good you posted this. I believe you read it? The reasons for depletion are well stated and will happen again if Oil drops to $26pb.

6862 2018-04-10 13:27:16 Thank you Iceland for banning use of palm oil in your products
6863 2018-04-10 13:27:16 เห้ออออเดือนนี้ใช้เงินเยอะวะ 
แต่ซื้อเถอะรูดบัตรวนไปค่ะ555
6864 2018-04-10 13:27:13 Thanks I read that before but we have to reduce our consumption of palm oil and that has include other oils too
6865 2018-04-10 13:27:09 Great piece on the @theJeremyVine show with @IcelandRichard on #palmoil. Iceland taking a stand against deforestation for cheap oil. The story of Iceland as told by @MalcolmCWalker well worth a read too.

6868 2018-04-10 13:27:00 Or try other things! They’re so cheap. I use the rose hip oil, niacinimide, 2% retinoid, and hyualonic acid (sorry so many typos lol)
6869 2018-04-10 13:26:59 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

6871 2018-04-10 13:26:43 Shower thought for the day: why don't @AERA_EdResearch or @NCME38 accredit off-the-shelf assessments? My 4th grader's Case 21 score report has "college readiness" cuts based on four or five (subdomain) MC items. This is snake oil and a threat to the industry's credibility.
6872 2018-04-10 13:26:43 Does he know that tax on oil profits is the only income there is from oil, and they are pretty much at zero? I’m sure he’s been told that.

6874 2018-04-10 13:26:38 I am a huge supporter...but not on this topic.
Palm oil provides about 1% of humanity’s global calorie requirements.  If we stop using it in food, what do we replace it with?

As a prophet of prosperity I prophesy increase and debt cancellation to you.
6880 2018-04-10 13:26:10 Just kindly ask them to make you a salad? Like tomato, salad plant, cooked green peas, cucumber, sweet onions.. canned pineapple if you like... and to dress it all with olive oil and spicy vinegar (if they have one), With this you should be able to dine in any restaurant.

6885 2018-04-10 13:25:42 The other night I went for a meal ate delicious food and expensive wine which got me to the point of drunk where I actually felt more in tune with myself than I have this entire year. I even talked sincerely about future plans and said ‘I love oil painting’ and actually meant it
6886 2018-04-10 13:25:40 Hi Kyle. Unfortunately the implications far outweigh the content of the story. Put cancer and oil well in the same story and you’ve created a firestorm. We all enjoy the benefits of oil and gas production...that’d be an interesting story to run??

6900 2018-04-10 13:24:23 There is no abiding national security interest to support exempting companies from anti trust for this. Plus, it would be a terrible idea for any US oil company to do because there would 50 other companies who would just increase their own production

6915 2018-04-10 13:23:26 All those who thought of #Iceland as the "shop of the chav" need to rethink - Iceland now leaders in banning unneccessary plastic packaging, and now palm oil. #congratulations #WellDoneIceland

6918 2018-04-10 13:22:58 Why do you suppose we ramped up oil production?  Plus food exporter.  We'll call the shots until both of those things change.  Not an endorsement, an observation.

6939 2018-04-10 13:20:48 Hi! By the end of 2016 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable.  We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Drago

6962 2018-04-10 13:19:06 There were companies hedging oil at $140pb. I wonder how that ended.

6966 2018-04-10 13:18:37 Ok lovely ladies, another reason to take another look @IcelandFoods they have got a money off voucher in your WI voucher book. Pop down and support your local shop, they are banning plastic and palm oil #plasticpollution #PalmOilAlarmCall #TheMoretheMerrier
6967 2018-04-10 13:18:36 maybe because Mexico, South Africa and Congo dont have OIL.
6968 2018-04-10 13:18:14 there are approximately 1.5 million blue collar workers in the oil industry. What is more dangerous?
6969 2018-04-10 13:18:12 Nice

I was gonna suggest soaking or even thinly applying tea tree oil

But if the oatmeal does it, make a good goo of it to stuff in latex gloves, wear for a bit (no, not the instant flavored kind)

6993 2018-04-10 13:16:21 Nice piece on ethical investments @brookeamasters, but saying the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund considers to ban petroleum investments because of ethics is plain wrong, the sole reason is to reduce oil price risk. There’s a reason why it’s popularly called “the Petroleum fund”
6994 2018-04-10 13:16:03 Only for as long as the rest of the world agrees to use it in exchange for oil.  If two or three big players switched to an alternate means of payment, the dollar would hyper-inflate overnight.
6995 2018-04-10 13:16:02 In Canada, the discovered+undiscovered is about 350,000 million barrels of both light and heavy. Each year the proved reserves rises steadily from both new discoveries and innovation on production techniques. An extrapolation = about 2125 before the commercial oil runs out.

6998 2018-04-10 13:15:34 After the collapse of oil prices which brought .80 per L gas, oil companies wasted no time slowly creeping the price up to & above the psychological $1.00 per L mark. Add carbon taxes etc, & here we are. Ponder for a moment what would happen if oil were to go to $130+ per B.
6999 2018-04-10 13:15:29 Meanwhile no FBI raids of the various Bush homes or even a serious investigation into Zapata oil's roll in the attempted overthrow of Castro and the billions the Bush family received in undisclosed payments.

7088 2018-04-10 13:08:03 66.0 probably good resistance but i cant see this going much further.. we basically built in $3-4/b of geopol risk from Iran and Syria and to me both dont seem to have any effect on oil.  China tarrifs are much more real and bearish than either of those

7121 2018-04-10 13:04:34 .When palm oil washing up on British beaches poisons our dogs and other wildlife that comes into contact with it, it has no place in the food chain or anywhere else!!

What link does ECA have to recession/economic downturn? Was NIG the only country affected by D oil glut? Better narrative needed, men.

7170 2018-04-10 13:00:26 Combined with the fact that you’d need a pressing issue of national interest to justify it and most people think an over supply of oil is a good thing - consumers love it so the backlash would be intense even if industty supported
7171 2018-04-10 13:00:24 My car is basically out of oil. That shouldn’t be a sentence I say more than once let alone at all
7172 2018-04-10 13:00:23 A spike in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have pushed oil prices higher, with US crude futures up 1.3% to trade at $64.20 per barrel. The price of Brent crude also rallied, via @CNNMoney

Brit media really needs to look into this. I lived through several of the SEA hazes it creates. The industry is corrupt to the bone.
7194 2018-04-10 12:58:29 Coal Pwr elimination should be 'Canada's Plan'. Instead we have Bill C-69 which hits a pipeline’s GHG emissions, up/down stream but exempts imported oil and so confers huge advantage on our competitors. Add that to the 'landlock' discount on CDN oil ... Liberal disaster

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

7209 2018-04-10 12:57:47 Would be much higher if we had oil or oligarch money.
7210 2018-04-10 12:57:41 I have read this but the time has come to remove palm oil from products. It is NOT sustainable!

7212 2018-04-10 12:57:36 Yep your arrogance is right up there too. The oil industry is a shared economy and so are the financial Benifits. Glad you moved to B.C where ignorants is bliss...
7213 2018-04-10 12:57:36 I just hit a oil pen for the 2nd time ever. I can already tell it’s going to be an interesting day. 
7214 2018-04-10 12:57:35 We have little power "to make sure" crops are ethically produced+sourced. Deforestation is a foregone conclusion on earth. Its basically a business model of the elite. Of course don't buy palm oil+one must engage+practice ethical behavior. But the grand scale is out control.
7215 2018-04-10 12:57:30 This is a very powerful visual depiction, which can be quickly discerned. The heart disease and vegetable oil lines run parallel as the rates increase...
7216 2018-04-10 12:57:29 You need ~6x the land area to produce the same amount of oil from soy as you get from oil palm! It's a complex problem and developing countries rely on palm oil to grow so just banning it probably is too simplistic.

7232 2018-04-10 12:55:56 Hi there, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforests. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.

7235 2018-04-10 12:55:31 I have no problem sitting in the sidelines for now until this clears. We should get clarity by the end of the week. I also suspect Syria is the cause. Russia did this on purpose to prevent oil's fall me thinks. Hell, they saw how it worked for a quick pop last year.

7244 2018-04-10 12:54:54 See that’s the problem though “done properly” would involve the combination of “government” and “efficiency”.  Oil and water man.
7245 2018-04-10 12:54:48 Khamenei/IRGC going to get bunch of dollars today and everyday from sales of oil, they can buy excess tomans with it & then pay some of their people from the University or wherever with tomans to find solutions to the various problems in Iran, like water, health, oil deposits etc

I've been trying to avoid anything with Palm oil for a couple of years now.  Will definitely be doing more of my shopping in Iceland now.

7252 2018-04-10 12:54:10 @IcelandFoods Why remove palm oil, which is THE most productive plant oil. To replace it with a different oil would require a much larger area of some other animals' habitat to be destroyed. Truly sustainable palm oil is THE most environmentally friendly option. #PalmOilHysteria
7253 2018-04-10 12:54:05 "Trump’s foreign policy might mark Peak America" I saw this article headline in a website called "Peak Oil" , seems about right.

7255 2018-04-10 12:53:56 We discussed some tips under the tweet but here is an outline:
- make sure to wet it or rub a little coconut oil on it before inserting it 
- be relaxed when inserting
- Make sure you seal it by twisting it and pulling up and down
- push & squat to remove it

7257 2018-04-10 12:53:50 ...We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Over 1700 of our own brand products now use certified sustainable palm oil. Gordo 3/3.

7260 2018-04-10 12:53:41 No worries. It was just to benefit from a larger character limit. I assure you that we are committed to sourcing with integrity, it is one of our core values. Our Sustainability Plan commits us to sourcing our palm oil sustainably ... 1/3
7261 2018-04-10 12:53:40 @IcelandFoods well done ! I will shop with you from now on . No palm oil . Amazing!
7262 2018-04-10 12:53:37 Antitrust laws prohibit something like this. There have been times (1972&73) when certain companies were given assurance from Justice Dept that they wouldn’t be prosecuted if negotiated alongside other oil majors with OPEC but joining a cartel is the antithesis of free enterprise

7265 2018-04-10 12:53:18 Thanks for  response , but I still think companies like Iceland  can help , palm oil producers in West Africa , develop production process in order to meet  the demand  without actually  damaging  the environment, that was the main reason for my tweet
7266 2018-04-10 12:53:13 I’m just mad they didn’t edit out the oil stains on the floor like yeesh

7350 2018-04-10 12:44:09 And we need "social license" for exporting oil? How about - again - automotive, air travel, cargo shipping (including import of wind/solar components), BC coal industry? They don't need that? How about oil imports from Qatar and Nigeria and California?

7380 2018-04-10 12:40:42 It's the most powerful anti inflammatory that I have found, & it doesn't seem to have many of the nasty side effects that OTC stuff does. You mix with coconut oil & black pepper as the fats & piperine improve the uptake of curcumin. Extracts of curcumin just don't seem to work.
7381 2018-04-10 12:40:37 #wti #oil  Saudi first wished for 60, then it was 70 and now 80.  They will only push the shale producers to pump more.  PPI up, FOMC now has more reasons to raise rates.
7382 2018-04-10 12:40:34 I'm coming. Let me finish eating my yam and red oil first
7383 2018-04-10 12:40:33 I’m not sure about that. The amount of oil and gas in Syria will have May and Trump rubbing their hands with glee. If they could just get rid of those pesky Russians and Assad...

7385 2018-04-10 12:40:27 I smell like coconut butter and coconut oil 
7386 2018-04-10 12:40:24 Brett is this a nation based on oil?
7387 2018-04-10 12:40:23 Because my yt coworkers never take off when they're sick and overall being outside I take a teaspoon full of cod liver oil in my morning tea, Super B-Complex, a multivitamin in the morning and D-3 and echinacea at night
7388 2018-04-10 12:40:23 MSM is pure tribalism and it's pretty bipartisan when it comes to militarism, oil companies, various other things that help fund the networks

7390 2018-04-10 12:40:14 The reference above the IEA.  They are predicting massive increase in shale oil production year after year, but .....
7391 2018-04-10 12:40:13 I’ve been burning old tires doused in used oil and diesel for three days. I’m hurrying this global warming along. Doing my part

7394 2018-04-10 12:40:07 You nailed it. I suggest anyone seeing nothing good about Nigeria presently should check out on what is happening presently in Venezuela, an oil rich nation.
7395 2018-04-10 12:40:03 Alberta's oil is not "landlocked" it gets to Canada's west coast, USA's gulf coast and east coast everyday - by pipeline.  World is now taking action on #climatechange.  Expanding production is bad economics - like opening more Blockbuster stores after Netflix is introduced.
7396 2018-04-10 12:40:02 I was amazed when I learned about destructive impact of palm oil and hearts of palm. Glad to see this news!
7397 2018-04-10 12:40:00 If Midde East countries (Qatar, Bahrain et al) successfully develop their shale resources, we may see low oil prices for pretty much the rest of the century. Things like energy transition will not be cancelled but rather delayed or implemented in a slower pace.
7398 2018-04-10 12:39:59 And part of medicine is to know what to best use, e.g. for scars, even dermatologists often recommend tea tree oil, and it's an evidence based treatment. The problem is when you try to use useless treatments (MMS) or treatments inappropriate to the condition (Lupron for autism)

7417 2018-04-10 12:37:45 Mr. Zarif, you should create a value for your citizens. Pouring the oil money to mullas is not the right way to spread wealth amongst your citizens.
7418 2018-04-10 12:37:45 Crying with happiness that @IcelandFoods are cutting palm oil from their products, lets keeping pushing to save our beautiful planet!
7419 2018-04-10 12:37:36 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
7420 2018-04-10 12:37:34 まけ！
7421 2018-04-10 12:37:19 They suggest using their wake and bake oil which is sold separately

7428 2018-04-10 12:36:40 In 1865, I borrowed money to buy out some of my partners and take control of the refinery, which had become the largest in Cleveland. Over the next few years, I acquired new partners and expanded my business interests in the growing oil industry.
7429 2018-04-10 12:36:38 .For years Canadians have wanted their governments to work together for the benefit of Canadians. 2018 the year @RachelNotley, @JustinTrudeau, @cathmckenna, @jkenney @AndrewScheer all finally come together and guess what it's for, #DilBit.
Oh Canada. We stand on guard for #Oil?
7430 2018-04-10 12:36:36 @marksandspencer @waitrose, Why no action on climate change? @IcelandFoods are miles ahead with revised packaging and palm oil bans. Are you going to act or do I have to start shopping elsewhere!? #climatechange #FoodForThought

7450 2018-04-10 12:35:38 You spend all your time thanking, apologizing, mourning and clothes selecting, but do nothing for pipeline  except words.

7456 2018-04-10 12:35:11 Industrious even as a boy, the future oil magnate earned money by raising turkeys, selling candy and doing jobs for neighbors. In 1853, we moved to the Cleveland, Ohio, area, where I attended high school then briefly studied bookkeeping at a commercial college.
7457 2018-04-10 12:35:10 Unlikely to be due to smoking cessation. Rate of smoking cessation has been steady since the 40s. Statins  definitely a role in the rapid decline since 2000. This graph seems to show more correlation between the increase in veg oil and the plateau and slow decline in deaths.

7472 2018-04-10 12:33:20 Which is brilliant. But by stocking other brands that do contain Palm Oil you're diluting your position and being hypocritical. Why make a half arsed stand when you have the opportunity to really lead the way?
7473 2018-04-10 12:33:18 Please, America has been disillusioned for years by the media and our elected officials, our corps like Monsanto, Big Oil, Pharma have been the biggest sources of propaganda for years. Russia is a minor player.
7474 2018-04-10 12:33:01 Thank you! It was very tasty, and I barely used any oil so it was healthier

Question for the community on here. Ive tried a few different meds for my anxiety and nothing seems to help anymore. My last resort is to try marijuana or cdb oil. I am wondering what are ways people are using to cope with Anxiety?
7493 2018-04-10 12:30:56 I entered the then-fledgling oil business in 1863 by investing in a Cleveland, Ohio, refinery. In 1870, I established Standard Oil, which by the early 1880s controlled some 90 percent of U.S. refineries and pipelines.
7494 2018-04-10 12:30:53 Despite reading #ToolsOfTheTitans  (note-push through 1st third of book) never thought I would try "bullet proof" coffee. Last night at #TAGCycle the sports nutritionist also recommended (but with coconut oil). So here it goes: pre-workout bulletproof coffee!
7495 2018-04-10 12:30:50 . @Waitrose great news about disposable coffee cups, now be the next supermarket to stop using palm oil.

7498 2018-04-10 12:30:34 Making hummus.. (chickpeas soaked, boiled, simmered.. blended with extra virgin olive oil, no tahini in cupboard, used paprkia for flavour). Noticed that taste-difference of home made versus commercial/store bought hummus is around sweetness/apparent sugar content.. unexpectedly.
7499 2018-04-10 12:30:32 Well now because of the supposid gas attack by Pr Assad U.S will never leave. Why should  we leave, who will take care of the oil afterwards. We have to wait for permission by Israel to leave as well. Its never been about the people but more about who controls the resources.
7500 2018-04-10 12:30:32 I tried the Beauty Bakerie foundation today and didn’t like it AT ALL. I tried layering it and it immediately crumbles. You can only paint it on, not blend in. And you definitely need an oil primer w/ it

7502 2018-04-10 12:30:17 That leaves fake wealth of US at, what, 9 trillion and debt of 17 trillion?
Real GDP per capita at $36,000 not $56,000... about right for a developed country that can't fund its own health care and has trailer trash everywhere. When will the west stop sponging on Muslim oil?

Let your clothes always be white [with purity], and do not let the oil [of gladness] be lacking on your head.#WalkingWithGod
7513 2018-04-10 12:29:04 is it that the West never learns from history or is it a deliberate strategy to oil the machine and business of the military Industrial complex?

7516 2018-04-10 12:28:08 Ok, we need to talk about #AQuitePlace. Leaving perfs & atmos aside (both v.good) am I alone in wondering how electricity for lights & monitors generated? Nat Grid? Not oil or diesel (too noisy). Solar then? Didn't see any panels but maybe missed. Tiny niggle but felt important.
7517 2018-04-10 12:28:04 I knocked a whole bottle of oil over in my sleep and now everything on my nightstand damn near ruined

7519 2018-04-10 12:28:00 Did you know olive oil can be used as a cleaning agent? You can do away with harmful chemicals and use some olive oil to scrub floors, wooden furniture, stainless steel and kitchen fittings.
7520 2018-04-10 12:27:57 In my ongoing quest to cook nice food for my mum, who can't eat garlic because it makes her sick, I have found that garlic infused olive oil may be the solution! Cross those fingers for me lads!

7525 2018-04-10 12:27:26 Energy East was going to be exactly like Kinder Morgan, used simply to ship the dirty dilbit to the coast for export for some other poor country to clean up and use. And with the low price of oil, our dilbit is worth less and less each day. Bad economics, now.
7526 2018-04-10 12:27:23 The importance of knowing value chains. All the industries should consider end-to-end party. From supplier to consumer.

Losing this value, will cause big impact(s) in most of the things including pricing. 

E.g, oil industry - too much supply, less/fixed demand and market crash
7527 2018-04-10 12:27:20 Hi Sheila,  thanks for getting in touch. We’re putting an end to the use of palm oil as an ingredient in our own label products by the end of the 2018. We’re the first major supermarket in the UK to do so!
7528 2018-04-10 12:26:52 .@POLITICOEurope MEPs are calling the ban on #PalmOil for what it is: a BAN! Are @EU_Commission officials trying to hoax Malaysia and other palm oil producing countries with their misleading language?

7538 2018-04-10 12:25:48 Aloe vera and coconut oil are not homeopathy. If you believe they are, you're confusing natural remedies with homeopathy.
Homeopathic remedies are literally water and sugar pills. There is not even a single molecule of the original substance left. It's diluted out of existence.

7543 2018-04-10 12:24:39 You make a very good point, though, I'm not trying to be facetious or anything!
Natural routes certainly have benefits to them - can be a little cheaper + multi-use (coconut oil) + easier than going to the doc!
I believe there is also research showing their benefit!

7564 2018-04-10 12:22:43 Lol, oil rigs aren't going to be near Florida shores....  That was announced 2 months ago...
7565 2018-04-10 12:22:40 It’s a start and requires government backing and investment. Large companies are going to need to fund this with leverage and cash including Pipeline and oil and gas companies. Furthermore, oil and gas are going to be around for the long term as transition takes multiple years.

7572 2018-04-10 12:21:33 In other words, the US needs to devalue its currency for inflation effects by two-fold while virtually all oil is traded in dollars: to stop food prices in developing countries rising; there was a sharp spike in food prices in 2005-9 as oil prices went up during this period

7588 2018-04-10 12:20:14 Q post regarding FBI/midnight oil would seem to corroborate the story’s allegation that there is a rogue pro HRC element still functioning in the NY Office. We should know in short order if that’s the case. Very dicey stuff here.

7590 2018-04-10 12:19:32 You aren't getting it ... Trump owes the Russians billions. They put him in office so he would waive the oil sanctions in exchange for them waiving his debt. Quid pro quo.  Research Trump's history dating back to the 1980s and you'll see it all for yourself.

7654 2018-04-10 12:11:53 I think: being able to extract twice as much oil from existing field at same unit cost is like having a second oil field. "Land-augmenting". (OK, maybe it's a bit higher unit cost, at present.)

7657 2018-04-10 12:11:27 Palm oil or coconut oil ???
7658 2018-04-10 12:11:26 To be fair, @brianstelter is correct, I miss the days of hearing about how many scoops of ice cream a President received or how much ketchup he likes with his steaks. That was good old fashioned journalism.
7659 2018-04-10 12:11:19 @IcelandRichard Nice work on the palm oil and plastics! Now - replace your van fleet (and staff cars) with electric vehicles, and maybe add some charge points to store car parks? Pre order some @Tesla trucks and replace your HGV tractor units in due course :)
7660 2018-04-10 12:11:15 No you are just in denial of reality that Notley is handing tax payers money directly to oil companies. Something that other governments have been accused of doing but have never done at this level.

7667 2018-04-10 12:10:08 So happy to see that @IcelandFoods has decided to cut the use of #palmoil from its own products, to see this issue in mainstream news will hopefully bring awareness and educate the public into the impact palm oil has on species and the environment.
7668 2018-04-10 12:10:03 I think not as straightforward. Some oil palm plantations are rubber plantations that were cleared in the 1950-60s

7679 2018-04-10 12:09:15 I gave away some money oil this week and she made a post about it. I love waking up to deposits. 
7680 2018-04-10 12:08:57 Not only is this great news for the environment, but as someone with a palm oil allergy, it's good news for me personally.
7681 2018-04-10 12:08:44 Look it up that’s where the product is going.  The company might be American but the line is run out of Canada which means Canadian jobs.  The oil it ships is Canadian.  Which means Canadian revenue.  And since it arrives via freighter it’s not subject to s 20% discount.  Rich!

7742 2018-04-10 12:01:12 Agreed @verissimodiogo. All oils have their impacts. Palm oil is more productive, greater stability.
7743 2018-04-10 12:01:02 So they won’t need ANY....NO products that are produced from oil and gas to build your busses?

Does the vision also include no more palm oil?

Come and talk to us to know more
7756 2018-04-10 12:00:15 That's probably because Britain only really enjoys good relationships with countries it's selling weapons to or plundering for its oil or minerals.

There's a consistent pattern to that.

7782 2018-04-10 11:57:34 Ne znam baš. Sumnjivi su mi ovi Čačani, Luk oil itd... Ima tu nešto. A ono devojče Dragovićeva? Ona je sa Boškićem garant.

7784 2018-04-10 11:57:22 They make what is the only safe pizza for me. Due to migraines, I can't eat olive oil or aged cheeses. They don't coat pie bottoms with olive oil and they offer an American cheese pizza. I see them when I need a pizza fix.
7785 2018-04-10 11:56:59 Are they oil perfume
7786 2018-04-10 11:56:48 goodadd oil

7788 2018-04-10 11:56:18 I can’t get this oil paint off of my hands so it looks like i don’t wash my hands :( I’m not gross i promise
7789 2018-04-10 11:56:07 $80 oil would make gas $4 a gallon and world economy to crash.
7790 2018-04-10 11:56:04 What does Assad get out of this? Let’s be realistic. I’m not sure anyone on the Assad,Russia,Iran side would do this. The location is pertinent for oil tho. Quatar pipeline and Israel also wants a pipeline to compete against Russia oil in the EU. What does Assad gain?
7791 2018-04-10 11:55:50 Yamal LNG, Gorgon LNG Aasta Hansteen oil platform ,Sakhalin’s Berkut oil platform. There is a few massive NEW project around the world. Easy to discovering if you want to be honest with what’s happening around the world. @CanadaAction @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau
7792 2018-04-10 11:55:48 @IcelandFoods fantastic new first taking on plastic waste now palm oil 
7793 2018-04-10 11:55:45 Some people just cant see the forest through the trees. Cara thinks that over regulation is a sign Junior and Butts want a pipeline. Or that creating downstream emissions for energy east was to help the pipeline. Notice foreign oil and Bombardier do not have those regs forced.

7795 2018-04-10 11:55:28 What type of food in the tabernacle was anointed with oil?
(Exodus 29)
7796 2018-04-10 11:55:16 Wouldn’t it be great if supermarkets had a button you could press when shopping online that allowed you to filter out certain products. Namely those that contain palm oil or meat or dairy.
7797 2018-04-10 11:55:14 @IcelandFoods Excellent news about you stopping using Palm Oil. Hopefully other supermarkets and brand companies will follow your lead
7798 2018-04-10 11:55:10 Oh I just meant because the US and oil
7799 2018-04-10 11:54:58 This is something I've been wondering about in for a while - how we (and corporations) define 'sustainability'. Is it sustainable to cut down an old growth tree and replace with a sapling? I wouldn't have thought so. Reusing old palm oil plantations - really interesting! Thanks!
7800 2018-04-10 11:54:57 Correct!!!! U Sabi something. God bless!!! U head get oil. More blessings
7801 2018-04-10 11:54:46 Nope I haven't... Never knew yol even had a tissue oil
7802 2018-04-10 11:54:36 "Certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) is then sourced through approved segregated or mass balance (‘mixed’) supply chains to reach our products" 

So you can't/don't actually know what proportion is "certified sustainable". 

I call BS.
7803 2018-04-10 11:54:33 I still don't understand why more of the tar sands oil isn't refined in Alberta.
7804 2018-04-10 11:54:26 We are sorry to hear that you have been informed that James Wellbeloved uses palm oil as this is not the case; we do not use palm oil in any of our products. Best wishes, Team JWB
7805 2018-04-10 11:54:23 Oil, olive oil, also an import, hence boiling or roasting or butter.
7806 2018-04-10 11:54:20 I know rite!! Such a snake oil salesman 
7807 2018-04-10 11:54:08 Is it true that it's the most productive oil we can produce?
7808 2018-04-10 11:53:56 tweet deleted? Huge global demand for palm oil, really interested to hear about sustainable production.
7809 2018-04-10 11:53:54 Take a swig of this... fish oil.
7810 2018-04-10 11:53:53 Mmmm roasted with olive oil, salt, white wine 
7811 2018-04-10 11:53:52 Instead of vegetable oil try OLIVE OIL.
7812 2018-04-10 11:53:51 There's no advantage to the Syrian people.

However, there is huge advantage to the US in having someone 'friendly' running Syria. They'll get to build their gas pipeline, they'll get to keep the Golan oil fields and they'll be better placed to stage an invasion of Iran. Result!

7814 2018-04-10 11:53:42 No such thing when a crime is being covered up! Cannot wait to see you in jail! You are a snake oil salesman, thecmost corrupt president in history, and a dangerous one, treason is not a joke!

7818 2018-04-10 11:53:33 I have lived in lagos and currently in ph....ph is just unnecessarily expensive cos of the inflow of oil workers with nothing to show for it....poor infrastructure, increasing number of prostitute
7819 2018-04-10 11:53:31 Scotland handed the oil industry to London 50 years ago - country is doing the same with wind-power to multi-nationals - it's ludicrous.

7824 2018-04-10 11:52:35 Throughout the history, it was your army wich invaded so called third world countries. And the real reason for declaring war, was just to control the resources of those countries e.g. oil, gas & ore. None of these countries came begging to your greedy administration.
7825 2018-04-10 11:52:26 Definitely every oil company wants that price, but in linking to the IPO & valuation, its very simple: better to have a higher 3 financial statements, 2016-18 instead of 2015-17.

7828 2018-04-10 11:52:00 @waitrose removing cups is a good start, but @IcelandFoods have taken the green crown today with the palm oil ban! When are you going to catch up? No such thing as "sustainable palm oil"
7829 2018-04-10 11:51:57 if the $1billion been removed from the excess crude oil account is used for the maintenance,repair and reinvention of our arms and ammunitions in order to manufacture our weapons then The issue of security would be solved #RestructureNigeria,#RESTRUCTURESECURITY
7830 2018-04-10 11:51:55 I suppose looking at it, they could entertain Adrian with some pole dancing?
7831 2018-04-10 11:51:49 Brilliant action today from @IcelandFoods & @waitrose on palm oil & coffee cups. Good behaviour is so reassuring #definitelyshoppinghere

7840 2018-04-10 11:50:14 You know that leaving Syria to the Russians has just given them 2.5 billion barrels of oil exclusively and they will control oil supply  and prices enough to hurt most countries reliant on exported oil.

7842 2018-04-10 11:50:09 ...always seems to revolve around oil producing countries.
7843 2018-04-10 11:49:58 Bravo @IcelandFoods for banning palm oil on its own brand products. An excellent example to set. Sustainable palm oil does not limit deforestation.
7844 2018-04-10 11:49:45 via @Nidhi712 : India's Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) has cut its annual oil import deal with Saudi Aramco by about 22 percent to 70,000 barrels per day (bpd). Trend alert! #Saudi hurting demand for its crude in Asia #OOTT

7848 2018-04-10 11:49:28 Well done. I try to check any food I buy for palm oil and avoid it. Back you all the way. I love the gentle Orangutan, and other animals of the rain forest in Borneo, such as the Gibbons and their wonderful morning songs.

Por lo menos $ 6000 x camión. El tema es que el salario y el seguro, si no tenés viajes, los pagás igual y el gas oil NO

7858 2018-04-10 11:48:00 Right now you need to be very focused on what Russia and Iran are doing in the Middle East.  What are their long term objectives?  Part of our Strategic Policy is to protect those oil reserves.
7859 2018-04-10 11:47:53 What if you drill and you can't find no oil?

7881 2018-04-10 11:45:24 Where is the oil of lemongrass going ? Can you let us know to get these oils collected from farmers at good price?

7889 2018-04-10 11:44:25 @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts   Referring to the @KinderMorgan project as of "national interest" does not make it so.  Majority of Canadians are opposed to it and see oil industry in decline. You are coming across as someone who cares more about the past than the future.

8068 2018-04-10 11:20:54 It is very difficult and I know I have views that are different from those of many people I highly respect and I do admit I learn from these. I used to be very anti-palm oil but through research found who would likely bare the brunt of a complete ban.

8086 2018-04-10 11:18:53 There's potentially some health benefits, especially over sunflower oil which is quite bad for cholesterol.
8087 2018-04-10 11:18:51 David, if u had ever visited Balikpapan (I’ve lived there) u would know that a little oil could not mar an existing ecological disaster. This is the same place where u can go and stay at nearby lodges and annoy Orang-utans who have nowhere to go due to deforestation
8088 2018-04-10 11:18:46 Interesting. Sainsbury’s is a NDPE company? Which one of the four palm oil certification types applies to you?
8089 2018-04-10 11:18:43 We were amazed at NARL when we switched from Iraqi/Russian heavy crude to shale oil from Texas when the new owners took over.  We were always told the refinery wouldn’t run well but with a few tweaks it ran beautifully

8092 2018-04-10 11:18:01 Of course this is my personal opinion. But the chances of ever going backwards restoring lands already cleared for Palm oil would take hundreds of years and Bill Gates money..... I would agree banning new plantations is needed and retailers should only allow sustainable/traceable

8097 2018-04-10 11:17:49 The only reason I can see you needing beef fat while making one is to get them out of the baking tray. Though vegetable oil is just as useful.
8098 2018-04-10 11:17:40 I hate when you're driving in traffic and there is a car somewhere around you that's burning oil/ belt/ect. And you temporarily freak out thinking your vehicle is dying
8099 2018-04-10 11:17:19 The oil revenue paid for expenditure. If you think that’s a ‘waste’, that’s up to you. Circumstances in U.K. and Norway are very different.

8117 2018-04-10 11:15:35 There is a cost to being safe and stable though and I think many oil companies still look at less safe/stable countries for supply because of cost.  Will be interesting to see how China proceeds versus the US.
8118 2018-04-10 11:15:34 I couldn't find peanut, or almond butter without it, so I bought cashew butter that didn't include palm oil.
I never buy doritos...
8119 2018-04-10 11:15:31 I think it is in the interest of those who are sending oil via the Bosporus to make sure that their product doesn't leak on it's way to it's intended destination, so the businessmen profiting from this are just as interested in saving the environment as the environmentalists lol

8160 2018-04-10 11:08:31 Excellent move Iceland, let's hope it rolls back the omnipresent use of palm oil.

8180 2018-04-10 11:05:33 A complete ban on palm oil will do nothing but cause further deforestation and a collapse of local economies.

8203 2018-04-10 11:02:48 Actually, @RwandaInKenya, the real reason is that #Rwanda had no #Oil, #Diamonds, #Gold, et al. The West cares about resources, not humanity
8204 2018-04-10 11:02:44 Some examples of #sensoryobjects in my experience have had some positive results

Balls - padded,bumpy and flat.

Laminated sheets(warm)
Foods hard in texture 
Fiddle toys & lego

8205 2018-04-10 11:02:34 @theJeremyVine why are you not doing a show on the impending war in syria, surely thats more important than palm oil at iceland
8206 2018-04-10 11:02:34 Hi Andrew, the service agreement is that the correct grade of oil is used. This needs to be provided by the servicing garage.

8208 2018-04-10 11:02:18 And there’s that whole Yemen thing with hundreds of thousands of people being slaughtered by MBS as the US hoi polloi roll out the red carpet, desperately trying to to romance some oil dollars from his blood-stained iron fist.
8209 2018-04-10 11:02:17 Great news #Iceland will no longer be using palm oil in there products!
8210 2018-04-10 11:01:56 @Twylo says “Wait wait wait wait wait wait WAIT.  

So Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? WOW.”

8275 2018-04-10 10:51:36 It is your job to work with Alberta to diversify their economy to one that is more green and knowledge based because forcing oil on them now will only leave them worse off when oil is no longer an economic element.

8303 2018-04-10 10:48:38 We need a simple answer before #Scotref is even called. The one lesson we learned from #Brexit was that the pound dropped as soon as the results came out. This will happen again due to the UK reliance on Scottish oil. So we need a plan that doesn't rely on using the pound.

Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan all now under rothchilds control. 3 left in world, Iran is next, nth Korea is under China's control- rothchilds latest puppet and Cuba is being diplomatically persuaded. NWO nearly complete

8339 2018-04-10 10:44:43 Here are some facts: oil currently brings in pretty much no revenue. Salmond based his dishonest prospectus for 2014 on massive oil revenue.
8340 2018-04-10 10:44:19 Can anyone recommend some palm oil free soap? Looking to change the products in our office to more friendly items #PalmOil #PlanetMaintenance #organic #southwest #southwestisbest #sustainable
8341 2018-04-10 10:44:17 Hi Nigel, Have you seen our news from today ....We’re putting an end to the use of palm oil as an ingredient in our own label products by the end of the 2018. We’re the first major supermarket in the UK to do so!
8342 2018-04-10 10:44:13 戦力的にみたら火か水が欲しいんですけどね…
8343 2018-04-10 10:44:12 せめてdslでおねがい
8344 2018-04-10 10:43:48 Whether they donate money to the Tories or not doesn’t take away their ditching of palm oil and soon their ditching of plastic. If you can’t see the benefits of their move, don’t praise it and as said before, move on and focus your boycott elsewhere.
8345 2018-04-10 10:43:48 Girl you have no idea, this week is???? Hell???

8348 2018-04-10 10:43:15 You are splitting hairs. Scotland doesn't get the revenue the UK Gov does. Oil extraction costs are around $15 a barrel, oil price is $69 a barrel. It is the management and taxation that is the problem for the UK getting revenue. Nonsense to say oil won't be profitable again
8349 2018-04-10 10:43:12 I'm disappointed that you're shilling for rapists, torturers & murderers.
Assads maintained northern Syria as an internal colony, wheat & oil. Denied citizenship & economic rights to residents there, & regularly committed massacres everywhere in the country.
8350 2018-04-10 10:43:06 It would do more than help stop violent crime, legalizing cannabis oil would save lives. 
8351 2018-04-10 10:42:54 Some genuinely positive environmental news today from the UK with #Iceland banning palm oil in their own products and #Waitrose banning single use coffee #PalmOilFree
8352 2018-04-10 10:42:50 @ChrisGPackham Jeremy Vine will be talking about Iclands cutting Palm Oil on Radio 2 today... Maybe worth a listen?

8362 2018-04-10 10:40:43 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
8363 2018-04-10 10:40:35 I wish they’d just get out of there and let the people rebuild their lives, schools, businesses, hospitals etc. but no they can’t do that because there is too much oil and Moolah in the M East.
8364 2018-04-10 10:40:35 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
8365 2018-04-10 10:40:34 Don't remember Poland being a major oil supplier back in the 30's. Besides intervention doesn't necessarily mean troops on the ground (which nobody wants) It may however mean some pretty powerful demonstrations of force by air, which is wholly deserved if the regime used gas
8366 2018-04-10 10:40:28 @BBCBreakfast Why was the Iceland Representative given such a hard time when she had come to tell the BBC they are making changes by using less palm oil. There are bigger organisations that could do better by following Icelands lead. The way  news is reported for one.
8367 2018-04-10 10:40:19 So much time and so many eye infections! (Allergies, sensitive skin and eyelash x oil gland issues.) Not to mention money - I used to buy a new liquid eyeliner almost once a month for hygeiene & safety. At $10 to $30 a pop it adds up

8373 2018-04-10 10:39:54 The first U.K. retailer to ditch palm oil and plastic by 2023 is a pretty bold move if you ask me. Hopefully this step by Iceland will encourage other retailers to make the move.

8384 2018-04-10 10:39:00 The US ambassador to UN said today if UN won't kill/act then America will. This is real news worth mentioning. US will bomb the shit out of Syria and then Iran. But they won't hit the oil fields. Where is this chemical weapons proof? Not needed. Just blame Russia anyway
8385 2018-04-10 10:38:58 Meaning, what's wrong with sunflower oil? Serious question.
8386 2018-04-10 10:38:55 Imagine Libyan General Khalifa Haftar controlling 4 oil ports in Libya. Dude is probably a billionaire

8400 2018-04-10 10:36:50 Great news  SAHRA- where Iceland lead surely other will follow - and people now have a choice shop at Iceland instead of the other pro Palm Oil supermarkets.
8401 2018-04-10 10:36:43 Hey there, by the end of 2016 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable. We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Gary

8404 2018-04-10 10:36:19 (1)Word has it that Western allies may also be trying to provoke war in places like Russia, Syria, Iran, etc. essentially to try to take oil and other fuel supplies because we will be running out and alternate fuels have been suppressed for too long.

8407 2018-04-10 10:35:50 Because of OPEC's now-defunct monopoly on oil production. Defunct, due to the fracking revolution.

8420 2018-04-10 10:33:26 Chicken is the most highly abused animal raised for fast food companies like you. This is one of the reasons why I don't step foot in McDonalds anymore & I used to be a customer. Also stop using Palm oil!
8421 2018-04-10 10:33:22 A good, informative thread. Just a bit confused by oil comparison. Oil clearly remains abundant, it does get reused in some ways, and above all it too ought to be controlled by ’us’ since it is a natural resource - including the decision to stop using it ASAP.

8427 2018-04-10 10:32:46 YES FRASER! Wouldnt have known about this without you  Not that i normally buy into health scares but Palm Oil is a bit worrying for your body as well as the environment
8428 2018-04-10 10:32:42 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.

8452 2018-04-10 10:30:00 For many years Alberta was quite wealthy on oil profits. People enjoyed rebates and other perks, and now they do not. We lost Cod Fishing, had our oceans contaminated with Political Fish Farms, and loses probably as high in GNP
8453 2018-04-10 10:29:59 You wouldn’t of heard but a load of palm oil was washed up on the north Norfolk coast, several dogs have died after in digesting it.  must of come from a container that had fallen off a ship.
8454 2018-04-10 10:29:56 Exactly! Sky News mentioned oil hitting 70 dollars a barrel. It hit 147 dollars in 2008... and did they bring it down proportionally when it fell below 40 dpb? Yeah right! Shame on you British Gas!!!!!

8459 2018-04-10 10:28:43 Plus it’s something that needs to be tackled throughout the whole world. Then there’s oil spills. We watched a documentary the other day about old ships being dumped and people pulling them apart for scrap any old how.

8462 2018-04-10 10:28:07 Ya fossil fuels are buried combustible geologic deposits of organic materials, formed from decayed plants and animals that have been converted to crude oil, coal,natural gas, or heavy oils by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years.

8465 2018-04-10 10:27:41 palm oil is in half of all supermarket products and it’s a hard to get away from it, believe me when i say...it’s on an unimaginable scale! iceland have made a bold move for consumers to be able to buy some products knowing they are palm oil free and can be rest assured it’s not
8466 2018-04-10 10:27:17 Palm oil is a trans fat and shouldn’t be used and eaten anyway never mind de-forestation. Never, touch products containing palm oil. A lot of peanut butter’s have it, don’t touch them, use products like Meridian for peanut butter (I don’t work for Meridian!)

8468 2018-04-10 10:26:36 ...that had been destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations. this headline this morning has made feel like there is some hope! hope for the wildlife to recover and hope for the indigenous people who have been pushed out of their homes and land.
8469 2018-04-10 10:26:20 Last night, dreamed about Crush. But instead of MI5 rescue to cabin in woods, or high-wire alfresco in woods (theme )... we were doing dishes. Doing the dishes. Thankfully, turns out he’s not that into chores, and there’s quite a lot you can do with coconut oil and a spatula...
8470 2018-04-10 10:26:14 Wages and pensions are too low in this country, this has a direct effect on fuel poverty levels.
We need more investment in alternatives as we will runout of gas and oil, before we do prices will continue to rise.
We need effective regulation from government or re-nationalisation
8471 2018-04-10 10:25:57 Don't you think that if something is formulated as an oil or, as has been reported, a gel, its physical state (liquid/solid) in pure form is irrelevant? Absorption largely depends on physicochemical properties other than melting point (logP, ionic state + carrier material).
8472 2018-04-10 10:25:00 Yo @IcelandFoods thanks for actually caring about the environment and securing a better future for the planet. Thanks for dropping unnecessary plastic and palm oil. I’ve never considered shopping with you but I will now.

8481 2018-04-10 10:23:47 Hi Robyn, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard

8485 2018-04-10 10:22:58 Like we did in Libya? So Al Qaeda can murder Christians, throw gays off buildings and turn women into sex slaves? And we will look the other way as long as we get the oil, right?
8486 2018-04-10 10:22:54 @IcelandFoods  Well done  on your decision about Palm Oil.  Leading the way.  What about you guys??? @sainsburys @marksandspencer @waitrose @asda @MorrisonsStores

8492 2018-04-10 10:21:57 The problem is it's so difficult to determine what's sustainable & what's not. Sometimes the even name of palm oil in products is disguised in the ingredients list. I find it easier to try & avoid it altogether.

8503 2018-04-10 10:21:06 We completely agree that it's an important area to work on, Lauren. We've actually cut down our use of palm oil over the last 12 months, using different ingredients where we can. We'll continue to keep this in our sights! Please do email us if you'd like more info.

8506 2018-04-10 10:20:46 Hi there, we considered sustainable palm oil and recognise that the movement is working in good faith, but we believe its progress has been slow to address the widespread issues around palm oil production. The only way to tackle these problems is to limit the palm oil demand

8533 2018-04-10 10:17:20 Hi Emma, until Iceland can guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction, we are simply saying ‘no to palm oil’. Right now, we don’t believe there is such a thing as 100% ‘sustainable’ palm oil in the mass market.

8574 2018-04-10 10:13:06 Iceland bans palm oil from its own-brand foods by end of the year
via Telegraph News
8575 2018-04-10 10:12:40 As soon as China started selling CNY contract on Shanghai exchange, settling in Yuan, not USD, US retaliated by threatening tariffs. IMO - since the 2014 China/Russia exchange agreement for gas/oil is now up & running, goods traded between US/China/Russia should have no tariffs.
8576 2018-04-10 10:12:37 My only issue with this is we need provide alternative jobs for those farmers at the source of the palm oil industry. If we continue to stop using palm oil in eveything then those that rely on it for a livelihood will be out of jobs and unable to provide for families.

8604 2018-04-10 10:10:00 For me, Iceland stopping buying palm oil to help the earth is way more important than your politics and way more important than you. You're a nothing you cow!

Q
8618 2018-04-10 10:07:58 I have spent my life reading ingredients; I missed the bit when palm oil was in everything. Everything in the biscuit aisle (except the Highland shortbread). Did it replace misc vegetable oil? I assume it elongates shelf life and stability?
8619 2018-04-10 10:07:54 Cetaphill mmg mahal.. apa lgi yg oil punya.. takziah pada wang yg melayang.. 
8620 2018-04-10 10:07:49 Thank you for replying @sainsburys! Glad to hear you are working towards your palm oil use being sustainable, a ban would still be better though!!

8623 2018-04-10 10:07:09 So so pleased to hear that @IcelandFoods will no longer be selling products containing palm oil! Massive well done  let’s hope other big brands will follow 
8624 2018-04-10 10:07:01 Big up @IcelandFoods for banning palm oil. Brilliant job. Over to you @Tesco @waitrose @sainsburys @AldiUK @Morrisons @LidlUK @asda
8625 2018-04-10 10:06:58 Great initiative Richard! Are you replacing the Palm with another oil grown in South East Asia or cutting oil out altogether?
8626 2018-04-10 10:06:53 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
8627 2018-04-10 10:06:50 This is great news. Acquisition of palm oil sources has a huge detrimental effect on animal habitat. This will definitely get me shopping at #Iceland. Well done. Will probably be the first to eradicate plastic trays too.  #PalmOil
8628 2018-04-10 10:06:47 well done @IcelandFoods for stopping their use of palm oil.

8632 2018-04-10 10:05:53 Hi Valentina,  We’re passionate about pledging palm oil free on our own label products, but this is just the start. We’re speaking to all of our branded suppliers too and encouraging them to make the change too!
8633 2018-04-10 10:05:45 Well done @IcelandFoods for saying no to palm oil in your own brand products! You are leading the way in protecting the rainforests.

8641 2018-04-10 10:04:42 also @Tesco and @IcelandFoods @ChrisGPackham other Supermarkets in denial;  NO such thing as Sustainable Palm Oil on current volumes on global scale. Cut the oil out then you dont need 5x area to grow other oils. Leaving relic stands of old growth? Islands in desert monoculture.

8716 2018-04-10 09:55:13 I'm familiar w this debate from orangutan conservation perspective. @Fellwolf @WindleBeth are correct, OP is most efficient oil and a global boycott isn't an answer bc replacing w other oils would require even more deforestation.
8717 2018-04-10 09:55:11 A ban by big companies will bring media attention to the issues of PO, which is great! But PO is actually a good oil in terms of yield, so in theory sustainable farming would be ideal. However, 'sustainable' PO doesn't exist, as there's many ways to bend the rules/laws...

8720 2018-04-10 09:54:56 Just proves that it can be done, hopefully other supermarkets will follow their lead. Palm oil is not a necessary addition to any consumable, you only have to read the ingredient list to find it in pretty much everything these days.

8767 2018-04-10 09:47:21 Hi Annabella, we considered sustainable palm oil and recognise that the movement is working in good faith, but we believe its progress has been slow to address the widespread issues around palm oil production. The only way to tackle these problems is to limit the palm oil demand.
8768 2018-04-10 09:47:11 The oil companies have been doing it for decades; they have admitted they had evidence of global warming as early as the 70s and knew it was the burning of oil that was causing it. They are driven by one thing, greed.
8769 2018-04-10 09:47:04 One interesting thing is that it's Iceland (selling point = price) leading on palm oil and plastics rather than eg Waitrose (quality, smugness, price be damned)

8778 2018-04-10 09:45:46 Even sustainable palm oil plantations were once #forest. The solution is to cease using palm oil. That way there is no issue over source or supply chain. And I will no longer need to read all of your product labels to ensure I do not buy products containing palm oil.

8789 2018-04-10 09:44:18 It actually is quite straight forward.  The economy did very well in his early years amid high oil prices and he built up state substantial reserves. His recent adventurism has squandered that:  The reserves are gone, the ruble crashed & Russian stocks were down 11% yesterday.,

8820 2018-04-10 09:39:47 Other countries have prominent labelling of products that don't contain palm oil, so it's easy to avoid those that do. In the UK it's much harder - seems to be in everything :-(

8830 2018-04-10 09:38:08 Hi Drago. Supply chains in palm oil are far too complex to assure consumers that palm oil is sustainable. Can you assure us you trace the source of your products all the way to the plantation? Do you have this information publicly available?

8836 2018-04-10 09:37:01 It gets even a bit better in favor of EVs when you count in costs for oil changes (and other fluids), brake jobs, etc. EVs are nearly maintenance free, with tires being the only consumable they really share with ICE vehicles.

8857 2018-04-10 09:33:10 Countries with the highest fuel taxes also have greater resilience to oil price fluctuations, more efficient vehicles, less car dependency, and way less inequality than the US, for example, which has very low petrol taxes (& shit infrastructure).

8881 2018-04-10 09:28:59 Rapeseed oil and vegetable oils being used. Palm oil is the biggest issue. Praise them for action taken; pressure others to follow. Then we can tackle sustainability and environmental impact of the alternatives used and consumerism in general.
8882 2018-04-10 09:28:54 Pastotalists elites missing it. Pastotalists land is gone to new ventures, oil, roads, imaginary industries,housing etc. Why concentrate on consumption while nothing is in production and protection. 90% of pastotalists funds from partners. Whats government allocation like?

8900 2018-04-10 09:25:19 @TodayFM951 Nigeria is a work in progress. Results are already coming in, there is no silver bullet to solve the economic problem. It is gradual to have a sustainable economy which works with or without high or low crude oil prices. It is half full not half empty.
8901 2018-04-10 09:25:03 Feel like a proper grown up buying oil for my car like who am I when did I get this responsibility
8902 2018-04-10 09:24:52 I am calling on @BootsUK to stop selling krill oil products.  Surely no-one needs to 'improve their health' at the detriment of the Antarctic food chain.  Please follow the lead of other, environmentally minded retailers who have stopped this practise. #ProtectAntarctic
8903 2018-04-10 09:24:46 Eggplant parm is lovely, yeah~ This dish is actually a slight twist on it, roasting it with olive oil, soy and paprika before finishing it with a dusting of parm at the end. :3
8904 2018-04-10 09:24:39 I work on it a bit. It’s annoyingly complex. I feel they’re right in that ‘sustainable’ palm oil is a misnomer, but it is still more sustainable than the alternative crops. Imo we need to press for more environmentally friendly p/o, dunno if boycotting is the best option or not

8911 2018-04-10 09:23:55 Hi Dani, we considered sustainable palm oil and recognise that the movement is working in good faith, but we believe its progress has been slow to address the widespread issues around palm oil production. The only way to tackle these problems is to limit the palm oil demand
8912 2018-04-10 09:23:44 I totally agree oil and gas has brought death and destruction To our environment. I was for the wind energy But they left no corridor  for the migrating birds & butterflies.

8931 2018-04-10 09:19:56 Seems so! They are saving up & is only relying on Gas. Where as the bills we pay is according to Furnace oil. World is generating electricity via dams, but we don't want to use brains or work.
8932 2018-04-10 09:19:52 Pleased to see @IcelandFoods to ban palm oil in own brand products and @waitrose to ban disposable coffee cups. 

Only small steps but anything that reduces our impact on the environment is a step in the right direction.

8964 2018-04-10 09:15:23 That's great but why stock brands who don't support your ethos? Most consumers don't know about Palm Oil so it should be banned. Why offer other destructive, unethical choices? Are u not confident in your own more ethical brand or is it still about the revenue stream you'd lose?

8979 2018-04-10 09:14:05 That's my side. It got my oil.
8980 2018-04-10 09:13:48 I am a Scottish Nationalist- here are some facts.
There is still oil in the North Sea.
That oil provides revenue.
It is NOT a curse.

Scotland is not reliant on oil.
We have other resources.

We certainly can't do worse than WM.

8988 2018-04-10 09:12:26 Good morning Kathryn! By the end of 2016 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable.  We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Drago

9007 2018-04-10 09:09:59 I picked up somewhere that palm oil is actually a very efficient crop in terms of money that can be made in an area. If everyone stops using palm oil the same farmers will just move to a less efficient crop e.g. soya, will need to plant more & so will cause more damage.

9143 2018-04-10 08:51:30 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
9144 2018-04-10 08:51:21 @IcelandFoods Thank you for banning palm oil. @sainsburys @waitrose @marksandspencer @Morrisons @AldiUK @AldiUSA @Aldi_Ireland @LidlUK @lidl @lidl_ireland please take note. #NoPalmOil

9146 2018-04-10 08:51:20 Hi, We've considered sustainable palm oil & recognise that the movement is working in good faith, but we believe its progress has been too slow to address the widespread issues around palm oil production. The only way to tackle these problems is to limit the palm oil demand.

Go for it c:
9149 2018-04-10 08:50:40 Probably coconut oil. Much more eco friendly as can grow virtually anywhere & dont require deforestation
9150 2018-04-10 08:50:33 Hi there, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforests. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard. Kind Regards
9151 2018-04-10 08:50:21 Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil 
9152 2018-04-10 08:50:01 Yes but Syria or Assad is not that stupid or irresponsible to just lob that and with the world watching? This would only draw the bear into the fight. Follow the oil flow. Its Russia's oil and if provoked from actions. They will do in kind bk to Saudia Arabia
9153 2018-04-10 08:50:00 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

9164 2018-04-10 08:48:40 Good morning Kerry! By the end of 2016 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable. We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible.

9173 2018-04-10 08:47:40 CO2 emissions are not the whole problem, the loss of rainforest to grow beef for burgers, and palm oil for biodiesel is just as big of an issue if not more
9174 2018-04-10 08:47:31 Repeating the same word is not an argument. Where does it say they work for you? Even if we accept that as an argument, that means they also work for me and as a result, I give @SurreyRoadCops permission to educate the ill-informed about taxes and oil industry subsidies.
9175 2018-04-10 08:47:18 Fantastic news that @IcelandFoods will not use palm oil in any of their own products. Time for @Tesco @sainsburys @marksandspencer @waitrose @LidlUK to follow suit
9176 2018-04-10 08:47:13 So in response to my tweets that production is half Norway you decided to provide evidence it will continue to be?? Oil is not a curse, it's a large part of our GDP, economy and jobs market, but it's not a base for Public Spending. With tax income negligible what is our deficit?

9178 2018-04-10 08:46:56 Hi Martin, We understand your concern. Many examples of research and investigations into the production of palm oil reveals exploitation of workers. We believe the long-term benefit of palm oil to local communities can only come from a supply chain that is truly sustainable

It's 2018, we gotta protect the environment now 
9189 2018-04-10 08:45:21 Thanks for the reply Gordo and I appreciate the time. Unfortunately sustainable palm oil does not limit deforestation and does not limit the growth of palm oil plantations. Iceland acknowledge this, do you have a plan for removing palm oil from your owned products?

9232 2018-04-10 08:40:05 It certainly is difficult to avoid palm oil altogether. We don’t buy much processed food, which makes it easier, but not everyone has the time to make all their meals from  basic ingedients. I guess reading labels is the only answer, but some print is ridiculously small.

9265 2018-04-10 08:34:40 If worsen try tukar oil lain.
9266 2018-04-10 08:34:40 I think the fundamentals behind oil still remain somewhat fragile
9267 2018-04-10 08:34:34 Gas and power prices continue to look firm. This despite both EC and GFS weather runs now forecasting a much milder outlook. Prices have been supported as a weaker dollar has pushed up the price of dollar based commodities overnight, such as oil.
9268 2018-04-10 08:34:21 #OOTT | U.S. oil inventories had been rising for the past couple of months but the data released last week showed an unexpected draw. This week's data may be crucial for determining the direction of WTI. cc. @RivkinLive #WTI #Brent $CL_F

9270 2018-04-10 08:34:13 Not sure you got the message that there's 'no such thing' as sustainable palm oil...
9271 2018-04-10 08:34:07 ...more than double any other vegetable oil. Put simply, if everyone decided to change from palm oil to other vegetable oils we would need double the amount of land to produce the same amount of oil. Gary 2/2
9272 2018-04-10 08:34:06 We do not preclude the use of palm oil in our products. We believe that if palm oil is grown and managed correctly it is a sustainable choice of vegetable oil. This is because the yield of oil that comes from palm oil trees is...1/2
9273 2018-04-10 08:33:54 What are you doing to reduce sungle use plastic? Also you need to do more to stop your use of palm oil that is causing deforestation.
9274 2018-04-10 08:33:50 Waitrose planning to ban disposable coffee cups & Iceland supermarkets banning palm oil from their products... Happy Tuesday!
9275 2018-04-10 08:33:36 Have you tried CBD oil or capsules for your pain?
9276 2018-04-10 08:33:23 Big IF indeed! But as long as oil sanctions don't snapback, the government should be able to get its hands on enough dollars to make this work. Also much easier to insist on help now that they have unified rates, because it will assuage fears of rentierism.
9277 2018-04-10 08:33:08 Buy Unscented Aquas Cream, Coconut Oil, vitamin E oil and Olive Oil, mix all together and use it as your daily moisturiser. Your skin will thank you later. I am living testimony.
9278 2018-04-10 08:32:46 Unreal..oil pipelines UNDER the salt water ffs..it was a disaster waiting to happen..
9279 2018-04-10 08:31:53 Thanks for swift response. But why resorting to sustainable palm oil if @IcelandFoods can phase it out and replace palm oil?
9280 2018-04-10 08:31:46 I cant stand the oil money, but the victims really are getting on my wick this week.
9281 2018-04-10 08:31:42 I hope that people learn their lesson from this. Please learn about the candidates and what their stance on the issues are. Some of the people like Trump are snake oil salesmen who bank on the public being ignorant. Don't be.

9292 2018-04-10 08:30:57 This is great news! It really is time the other supermarkets followed suit and stop highlighting their ridiculous policies on sustainable palm oil which we know doesn’t exist!  @tesco @waitrose @sainsbury’s @asda @aldiuk @lidluk take note please!

9302 2018-04-10 08:29:21 To see how desperate these men are. They've announced Anambra State as an oil producing state just on the same day they made their intentions known. This is Greek Gift! Buhari must be sent backing.
9303 2018-04-10 08:29:20 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
9304 2018-04-10 08:29:06 I love that @IcelandFoods have decided to go palm oil free on their own product range. This is on top of the earlier announcement that they are going plastic free on their own brand packaging. The bigger brands should take note, this can be done #plasticfree #palmoilfree #Iceland

9345 2018-04-10 08:22:44 Hi there, thank you for your message. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforests. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard. Kind regards
9346 2018-04-10 08:22:39 Yeah, spent $35K on a Harley trike, leaks oil, reverse don’t work, parking brake don’t work, radio don’t work, and engine pings like a rice grinder, but Harley wouldn’t do anything about it while it was under warranty. After it went out of warranty they’d fix it, $3700.
9347 2018-04-10 08:22:37 Not true. Now oil must trucked or sent via rail across the country which is a much worse means of delivering oil for the environment.

9398 2018-04-10 08:16:53 #FSJ won 10 year £50m Contract with a UK based Energy Company for Vessel Management, Oil Transfer, Diving stuff etc. Nice bedrock Contract for them by the looks. I don't hold.
9399 2018-04-10 08:16:51 The Kurds are literally parked on every major oil field along the Euphrates. We OWN THAT SHIT right now, and you think this

fucking 

oil
9400 2018-04-10 08:16:29 I believe her govt is doing a lot in green energy and addressing climate change, and that's good, but she pairs this with a commitment to get oil to "tidewater".  I don't get it, honestly, except it's politically unpalatable to say Alberta must wean itself off of big oil.
9401 2018-04-10 08:16:23 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
9402 2018-04-10 08:16:23 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
9403 2018-04-10 08:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet the crime.
9404 2018-04-10 08:16:06 I absolutely love the oil memes
9405 2018-04-10 08:15:49 I need that. I'll put coconut oil in her hair even
9406 2018-04-10 08:15:40 I was wondering the same as I’m allergic to coconut & therefore coconut oil, which is now widely used under the umbrella of ‘vegetable fat’ 
9407 2018-04-10 08:15:33 Bravo to @IcelandFoods for banning palm oil in their own brand products. Nice to see a large company standing up to the devastation that palm oil is causing. #notopalmoil #palmoil

9409 2018-04-10 08:15:22 The map refers to Iran and allies. I assume the allies in this case are Hezbollah. A blip on a map does not back up your claim. You will need more than that. I do read Haaretz and I think it is a good newspaper. But we were talking about oil in Golan anyway.

9412 2018-04-10 08:14:42 There’s an agenda. Syria don’t have the world bank and they also want to run an oil pipeline from the Golan Heights through Syria and their president of Syria said no. The Rothschilds et al are all part of it is my understanding. Correct me if I’m wrong.
9413 2018-04-10 08:14:26 Have you tried our tissue oil gel? It helps reduce the appearance of scars.
9414 2018-04-10 08:14:12 Well done Iceland. Now what about the non Iceland ranges that contain it.  There is no such thing as sustainable palm oil. You won't find orangutans on a sustainable plantation and there will be none at all at this rate.  Just shocking.

9416 2018-04-10 08:13:49 Absolutely loving @IcelandFoods right now! First the commitment to end plastic on their own brand goods, now eliminate palm oil. 
9417 2018-04-10 08:13:48 I was  surprised when I watched the film yesterday, rather a tip isn't it.
9418 2018-04-10 08:13:40 There should be something on Local Content etc. I know #PetroluemAuthorityofUganda is strong on this with the Oil Companies.

9420 2018-04-10 08:13:30 Ruble is weakening due to genuine investor panic over the Russian market. This can't be attributed to Rosneft robbing the state coffers, a central ban slip-up, or global oil prices. Short-term investors are saying peace out for now.
9421 2018-04-10 08:13:15 Hey there, by the end of 2016 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable. We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Gary
9422 2018-04-10 08:13:13 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

9436 2018-04-10 08:11:45 退勤
9437 2018-04-10 08:11:43 Great move @IcelandFoods on the Palm Oil ban. Who's next?
9438 2018-04-10 08:11:33 But that's the thing though. @IcelandFoods are getting rid of #PalmOil altogether as certified palm oil doesn't mean it is sustainable. They have taken the lead. Will you follow?
9439 2018-04-10 08:11:22 At Natural Spa Supplies we would love to help those that have skin 'troubles' We supply a very beneficial Argan Oil in which applied twice a day will make a big difference. We also have a detoxing Rhassoul clay that keeps the skin fresh and healthy! 100% natural <3
9440 2018-04-10 08:11:19 Idk whats wromg with my hair conditioner but it smell weird... like house paint or paint remover... this shit aint Moroccan Argan oil
9441 2018-04-10 08:10:59 But, Palm oil is bad for us.
9442 2018-04-10 08:10:59 Exactly Ken! Whilst it’s good that they even have a ‘policy’, I do wonder whether is just paying lip service for public relations reasons and how well they actually do monitor their sustainable palm oil. I always err on the side of caution and buy NOTHING with palm oil in!
9443 2018-04-10 08:10:49 This is such good news, let's hope others begin to appreciate just how much palm oil is used in foods.  It's hard to avoid!
9444 2018-04-10 08:10:34 How sure can you be that the palm oil you allow is 100% certified sustainable? When the Bank of England looked into using it last year in our bank notes their supplier couldn’t be. And why have @IcelandFoods gone for the better option of actually not using it ?

9451 2018-04-10 08:09:52 This is fantastic! My son  avoids palm oil, but it’s hard because it’s in so many foods and products. I don’t normally shop in Iceland but will now !

9467 2018-04-10 08:07:56 Well done @IcelandFoods for banning palm oil in their own products. Let’s hope other companies - especially Pepsi take note.
9468 2018-04-10 08:07:54 Love how @IcelandFoods is taking a stand on plastics and palm oil, totally leading the way... Waitrose banning disposable cups is great but they're definitely a  bit behind the curve
9469 2018-04-10 08:07:54 Oil is not D problem. G7 nations have 2 things in common - they R either oil producing or refining nations (or combination of both). Most have profited from Nigeria's oil (USA, France, Italy, etc);  why can we profit from what is ours?
What else can we do with oil = NIG's problem

9502 2018-04-10 08:03:27 BTW, as long as Nigerian leaders keep exporting crude oil as is (without refining for fuels & petrochemicals), NIG cannot be better off than it is today.

D true VALUE of crude oil isn't in exporting as-is, it is in REFINING (fuels + Petrochems) - which this Govt has NO VISION to
9503 2018-04-10 08:03:23 Just curious, do we know anyone who got thousands of times more from questionable sources that might bear looking into? 
9504 2018-04-10 08:03:09 It may be "sustainable", but if virgin forest or land is being cleared for palm oil production then that is a problem regardless of how sustainable the production is once in place.

9515 2018-04-10 08:02:09 Hi Sam, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforests. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard. Kind regards

9517 2018-04-10 08:01:47 We take environmental matters very seriously, and make an active choice to support sustainable palm oil (ours is sourced from Colombia). If the worldwide demand moves to another oil, unfortunately this risks shifting the problem and creating environmental damage elsewhere.

9530 2018-04-10 08:00:26 @KPMG banning plastic cups, @IcelandFoods to stop using palm oil, @waitrose removing disposable coffee cups, me banning single use plastics. This is more like it. #plasticfree

9536 2018-04-10 07:59:55 Interesting. Ive never heard the stealing oil one before. Also - I am no longer paid by anyone.
9537 2018-04-10 07:59:43 Didn't they base their economic success and stability last time on Mao raining prices of oil above $120  a barrel?
9538 2018-04-10 07:59:42 Also its not an oil war. BC has nothing to fight back with. Especially since Sask said no oil either. Only other option is for tankers from US which defeats the purpose of the protests
9539 2018-04-10 07:59:27 My answer is to not to worry too much about vitamins in Singapore because you have to get things really wrong to end up lacking vitamins. What should be the focus though is fibre/healthy fat/avoiding sugar and excessive starches. I advocate for avoiding palm oil because that’s...
9540 2018-04-10 07:59:25 Tesco’s palm oil policy says the right things, but I always wonder how effective their approach is in practice. Oil from non- sustainable sources can so easily be added along the supply chain for extra profit and is almost impossible to control.

9543 2018-04-10 07:59:03 Good news for Asian rain forests, Iceland's supermarkt to ban palm oil in ALL products. A good start hopefully followed by larger countries.
9544 2018-04-10 07:59:01 Hardly anyone I've met @Istrade_Enerji 2018 thinks oil will escape $60-70/bbl average range for 2018, many in East Asia looking to US exports #OOTT #oilandgas

9660 2018-04-10 07:44:30 Yes, due to the lack of diversity in Albertan economy this is your equation. Oil is not a significant part of Canada's economy. Invest in carbon free energy - look to the future and not to a dying industry. #KeepItInTheGround #ClimateChangeIsReal Avoid mass extinction.
9661 2018-04-10 07:44:30 most oil production is in the middle east, and the venezuelian goverment cant controll the oil prices

9666 2018-04-10 07:43:32 @RachelNotley How come  it's OK for BC residents to  heat their homes with gas and oil. But not OK to profits selling energy  products to foreign buyers?  How come  BC won't stand with Canadian workers?  When did we cease to be a country?

9668 2018-04-10 07:43:24 "OIL IS A CURSE" - no matter how you slice it, Unionists will find some way to tell Scotland that "OIL IS A CURSE". WM survived on it for 40 yrs, WM still needs it.
Scotland- the only country to discover oil and become poorer- thanks to the economic illiterates in WM.

9670 2018-04-10 07:43:16 Yes, exactly!  Who owes the oil production?  The corruption is not at the feet of capitalism, but squarely with the regime that collectively runs it.. thank you for proving my point

9675 2018-04-10 07:42:34 Food with palm oil is often highly processed so no great hardship to avoid.

9678 2018-04-10 07:42:13 @IcelandFoods What alternatives will you use to palm oil? @geordiehugbug has certain food intolerances which I need to constantly think about.

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
9703 2018-04-10 07:38:15 Oh for goodness sake!  That is such a non-statement!!  Worthy of Dubya. Iraq was a war crime, no reason to start a war there except to prevent Saddam selling oil to the wrong people. Now proxy war in Syria not going their way so they’ll start WWIII rather than peace.

9706 2018-04-10 07:37:31 1/Venezuela has a largely capitalistic economy and is collapsing because of corruption and failing to adapt to dropping oil prices. In addition that 100 million figure is hugely in dispute, and on top of that, there are several models for Socialism. Some work out ok others don't.
9707 2018-04-10 07:37:24 Thank for your reply, but the concept of ‘sustainable palm oil’ is a fallacy. Never shopped in Iceland before, but will be headed there at the weekend to check em out, like a lot of other people I suspect!
9708 2018-04-10 07:37:23 Hi! By the end of 2016 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable.  We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Drago

9711 2018-04-10 07:37:04 China wants WAR? Ok then please go to the Middle East and suppprt the worlds oil flow. The US had and its cost us lives and over 4 trillion dollars. Also stop trying to replace the US dollar as the worlds oil/ reserve currency without first going to war for 20 years !
9712 2018-04-10 07:36:58 Interview today on @BBCr4today with Tony Blair.  At no point (on ME & #Syria) was it mentioned that Israel is:
1. still (over 50+ years) in illegal occupation of Golan Heights in Syria
2. Illegally drilling for oil in the Golan Heights (Genie Energy)

None of this is of interest!
9713 2018-04-10 07:36:52 This is where it now becomes dangerous, as UK, USA, Israel and Saudi want an all out war on Syria. Large oil and gas reserves there. Do people now see what is going on. Its greed by the CAPITALIST COUNTRIES. They want to westernise the middle east. Another Libya!! chem weapons

9718 2018-04-10 07:35:44 Notes say there is no synthetic oil - the locomotive's engines have been converted to burn liquefied natural gas as fuel. Would have to consult schematics on the conversion as there might be a slightly different operating temp.
9719 2018-04-10 07:35:41 Also, not entirely true about American car being about quantity!! We do build lasting autos and trucks! Have been for years. It's about preventive maintenance! Run a Hyundai very low on oil, or 5,000 miles over the scheduled oil change, often, and see what happens!!!

9743 2018-04-10 07:32:50 Well, I accept your explanations.
Fracking as I know is, pumping in waste water so that crude oil floats & can be extracted. This is considered as a factor to cause earthquake.
If the process you explain can cause earthquake, then it has similar effect as fracking.

Seriously though, a blanket ban on palm oil is not the best solution. There are plenty of @RSPOtweets certified sustainable suppliers. After all, almost all vegetable oils use land that would once have been forested.

9798 2018-04-10 07:22:24 As much as most of us GREATLY DISLIKE GEJ & PDP, PMS price was N 97 per liter when crude oil was @ $110+ per barrel (with D famed subsidy scam); now PMS sold for N 145 per liter, since crude oil was $30 per barrel under PMB (with a greater subsidy scam).

Be objective & sincere

9818 2018-04-10 07:19:38 @BBCNews @BBCBreakfast terrible presentation of news on breakfast this morning. Bully tactics on Iceland rep over palm oil, headlines continue to be phased initially as statement of fact then qualified as allegedly. This sexed-up style of news media reporting is misrepresenting.

9831 2018-04-10 07:17:36 Yep, Obama should've invaded & enabled al Qaeda to ethnically cleanse the country. That might've allowed western powers to get in there and steal Syria's oil.

9841 2018-04-10 07:16:48 Indeed, switching to another crop risks shifting problem elsewhere.  

Iceland's decision is direct consequence of the industry’s failure to stop destruction.

And, ultimately, Iceland uses a tiny amount of palm oil, so risk of knock on effects on other rainforests is small.

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
9905 2018-04-10 07:08:20 Well done @IcelandFoods...they are stopping the use of Palm Oil in their own brand products.... PalmOil use is causing deforestation and killing animals especially Orangutans in Asia.... it’s evil stuff. Please don’t buy products with it in and read all product labels carefully!

9924 2018-04-10 07:05:45 Oreo's and the like are questionably vegan. Soybean oil (I think) is questionably vegan. Sure, it's technically vegan, but it's not harvested very ethically.

9937 2018-04-10 07:03:18 Dreadful questioning from @BBCBreakfast to the @IcelandFoods representative about their new palm oil initiative. I suppose it doesn't make good telly just saying that's a great idea!

9939 2018-04-10 07:03:04 It can't really make sense to ship in palm oil when we have more local oils such as rapeseed. Also, so many products now contain palm oil that previously didn’t. We've never needed it in cakes or biscuits.
9940 2018-04-10 07:02:57 #Crude palm oil prices drifted further down by 0.68 per cent to Rs 645.80 per 10 kg in futures trade today as speculators trimmed positions, tracking a weak trend in the spot market on tepid demand
9941 2018-04-10 07:02:46 Woman from Iceland with positive news about removing palm oil from their products, and Charlie goes in hard like a gone-wrong Paxman. Slow hand clap @BBCBreakfast 
9942 2018-04-10 07:02:43 @BBCBreakfast Although I think Charlie Stayt is trying to be a contraversial, the fact that @IcelandFoods is taking palm oil out of their own brand products is amazing and he was being extremely rude

9954 2018-04-10 07:01:13 @BBCBreakfast Pathetic Charlie grilling poor Iceland Lady over sensible ban on palm oil in own brand items. Valuable first step to saving Orangutan. Read the ingredients and boycott plam oil.

Colossal pain in ass
9958 2018-04-10 07:00:47 Why were @BBCBreakfast presenters so combative with rep from @IcelandFoods about palm oil? Ok, what they’re doing is drop in ocean but it’s a start. sending a message that we cannot be complicit environmental disaster. They seemed hell bent on tying her in knots! #PalmOil

9960 2018-04-10 07:00:37 Angola has found itself with a dwindling amount of crude to sell as more of its oil flows to China for debt repayment, leaving little revenue for anything from oil sector development to health care in one of Africa's largest oil exporting nations.

9963 2018-04-10 07:00:26 @BBCBreakfast  palm oil  is used in food products just because it’s cheaper for manufacturers. Its Ruined our health & destroyed pristine rain forest habitats. DISGRACEFUL ON ALL COUNTS.

9966 2018-04-10 07:00:17 @BBCBreakfast did Charlie eat his cunt flakes this morning? How about congratulating Iceland on a huge first step instead of acting like a wanker? Is he getting kick backs from palm oil suppliers or something?
9967 2018-04-10 07:00:06 The national interest or the big US oil and gas interest? Why are you taking your orders from them and their shareholders? #cdnpoli #pipelines #TransMountain #KinderMorgan
9968 2018-04-10 07:00:06 To be replaced by what exactly? Coconut oil which has a lower yield per hectare? Anything you replace it with will have similar (if not worse) ramifications

9970 2018-04-10 07:00:06 Yes, I suspect it was to do with oil and/or oil pricing and/or nationalising it to benefit their own people more than US corporations. Always is.

9976 2018-04-10 06:59:47 Way to go @IcelandFoods! Just seen on @BBCNews.  Charlie is right, go 100% palm oil free, single use plastic free then #vegan options. Right direction!

9982 2018-04-10 06:59:06 Interesting discussion on the use of palm oil in supermarket products.
Iceland aims to stop the use of palm oil in its own brand products.
Their palm oil is sourced from Asia.

Is the palm oil produced across Africa as unsustainable as the palm oil sourced across Asia?

Thought Iceland were doing positive step by removing palm oil from their products. However you wouldn't have thought so from aggressive, argumentative interview from Charlie Stayt
9988 2018-04-10 06:58:39 @BBCBreakfast giving @IcelandFoods an unnecessary hard time over their positive move on palm oil. Unusually Charlie being a prat. Listen to her answers and stop trying to be John Humphries!
9989 2018-04-10 06:58:33 @BBCBreakfast come on Charlie State @IcelandFoods are clearly doing something good and showing leadership in achieving sustainable palm oil supply chain, why are you giving her a kicking? Crabs in a bucket!
9990 2018-04-10 06:58:22 Thought Bev Mitchell spoke v well on @BBCBreakfast about decision by @IcelandFoods to remove palm oil from own-brand products.
9991 2018-04-10 06:58:08 I applaud @BBCBreakfast for covering the very serious issue of palm oil and the destruction it causes to the planet. Well done @IcelandFoods for taking initial steps to remove it from your own products but u really should not stock any branded products that contain it.

9996 2018-04-10 06:57:35 Excellent news. Hope others follow. Been avoiding palm oil for ages as the blasted thing is in everything and for no good reason
9997 2018-04-10 06:57:35 Iceland Stores are Binning most   products made with Palm Oil  , Three Cheers For Iceland , Shop at Iceland , read the labels if you have no Iceland stores  in your town, Stop the Murdering Of More Rain Forest, The People & Animals Need The Rain Forest ,
9998 2018-04-10 06:57:25 It seems that #Iceland are making a good effort on the palm oil issue. Charlie was a bit harsh there. Get a few firms on who are doing nothing and set him loose on them @BBCBreakfast
9999 2018-04-10 06:57:14 Due to GOP and Trump energy policies (bringing back coal and emphasizing oil), we are one of the few nations left on earth not to recognize the pure folly of fossil fuel energy.
