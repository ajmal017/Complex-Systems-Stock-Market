10 2018-02-25 23:55:10 That is an ar15 with a bump stock, not a standard rifle.  I agree on bump stocks being banned.  But an AR15 is just a semi automatic rifle.

36 2018-02-25 23:51:24 This said I do believe people should have access to weapons that are NOT Semi Automatic or Automatic. I don’t think they should have access to high volume mags of any kind, stripper clips, bump stocks, modification kits ect.
37 2018-02-25 23:51:16 Ban, take away, destroy, stop manufacturing assault style, type, weapons, extended magazines, bump stocks. Stop it!!!!!!  Do away with them.
38 2018-02-25 23:50:54 Bump Stocks need to be banned! The age limit for military guns needs to be raised! There needs to be uniform, universal Federal rules to obtain a permit! Ammo purchases need to be limited and also tracked in a national database! This needs to be done this Congressional session!
39 2018-02-25 23:50:46 I SEE WHY THESE RAPPERS SELL DRUGS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY BUT IF I WERE Y'ALL IT'S BETTER TO INVEST IN BUSINESSES AND STOCKS AND WATCH HOW YOUR MONEY GROW

45 2018-02-25 23:46:40 You don’t need an AR-15 and/or bump stocks to go hunt. 

It shouldn’t be so easy to purchase an AR-15 anywhere online. 

Any one with a history of mental illness or domestic abuse should be banned from purchasing any gun.  

Background checks are a must.

Why is this so hard??
46 2018-02-25 23:46:34 @RepLanceNJ7, here is your chance.  If you represent us, and not the NRA, then be a leader and introduce legislation to protect our students.  A first step - ban bump stocks and raise the age for buying an AR-15. #NJ7 should lead, not follow.
47 2018-02-25 23:45:43 As an NRA member I support banning Bump Stocks and raising the minimum age to purchase any firearms.
48 2018-02-25 23:45:23 Never said they were. But the legality of bump stocks is a LEGAL accessory used to circumvent existing bans on fully automatics. None one wants to ban all guns, but banning things like bump stocks is a start to eliminating unnecessarily dangerous weapons.
49 2018-02-25 23:44:40 Sorry America, we need a time out from semi autos and bump stocks.
50 2018-02-25 23:44:34 $ISH. 5.4c Been waiting for the acquisition completion, bunch of 1.1c stocks issued but no cheapies? A zinc player worth watching, bit deep but very high grades and regional exploration potential looks to easily make up for that
51 2018-02-25 23:44:04 European stocks rose Friday, taking cue from a stronger Wall Street. @Daimler leapt 2.6% after Chinese car maker Geely spent US$9 billion to build a 9.7% stake in the Mercedes Benz manufacturer, while Deutsche Telekom surged 3.8% after returning to profit in the last quarter.
52 2018-02-25 23:42:31 The BND has been slaughtered for weeks.  Seems like we might be looking at a small retracement before it continues its death spiral.  The bounce would be just the boyz need to keep ramping stocks higher.
53 2018-02-25 23:42:28 Teenagers can’t even buy stocks in their own name, @business; they cannot enter into a legal contract, either.  There are reasons for this, the same reasons that cause them to make choices like eating Tide pods.  No, teenagers should not be allowed to vote.
54 2018-02-25 23:42:19 US stocks rose on Friday, with techs leading broad-based gains, as commentary from the Federal Reserve officials soothed concerns over the pace of interest rate rises in 2018.
55 2018-02-25 23:41:55 Yes! If I am elected your dictator, I will enact a salary cap on the Yankees! I will bring back the stocks to punish corporate malfeasance! I will put more taco trucks on the streets! and there will be BOURBON!
56 2018-02-25 23:41:35 This would be for people using funny money to pick stocks, commodities, currencies, possibly even startup equity. Like if you had a google sheet, but with proof that you made allocation decisions when you did.
57 2018-02-25 23:41:17 The NRA is part of the problem. We can fix mental health but without major changes to the gun laws these shootings will continue.I am a gun owner but I support strict gun laws, strict background checks, banning assault rifles, large capacity clips, & all mods like bump stocks.
58 2018-02-25 23:40:30 The NRA & I suppose it's members are not being punished if bump stocks & military style weapons are banned. The can still both and guns, rifles & shot guns. No one needs the bump stocks or military style weapons & they never should have been available in the first place.
59 2018-02-25 23:40:12 It is real easy. #POTUS has given you over 2 mil #Dreamers and he wants the #BuildTheWall. You should’ve supported that bill but you failed. #POTUS had ask for #GunReform by banning bump stocks and more but you will let that fail. #UnitedWeWin think about it and pass on
60 2018-02-25 23:40:11 60 total tweets and 5 of them are to me. I feel so special. 

Maybe you could sell me some small cap penny stocks ...
61 2018-02-25 23:40:00 I said nothing about bump stocks in my question. I said bump firing, you don’t need a bump stock to bump fire.
62 2018-02-25 23:39:48 so, after the Americans ban bump stocks, are 3d printers next?
63 2018-02-25 23:39:08 The ONLY reason the @nra would not want to limit gun buying age or limit bump stocks is SALES. They are nothing but a LOBBY for GUN MANUFACTURERS. #maga they have DUPED YOU into thinking they are protecting freedoms. They ONLY protect gun sales & PROFITS.
64 2018-02-25 23:38:56 Everything is cycles of ebb and flow from stocks, to skills, to basic intelligence. Just try to stay calm, enjoy life, and do what you do.

67 2018-02-25 23:37:48 The blood-soaked @NRA won't even support a ban on bump stocks for crying out loud. Their spokesperson @DLoesch is truly the spawn of Satan.

Elected officials must fear Voters more than they fear the NRA.
No NRA $$$
69 2018-02-25 23:37:12 We're not silencing you, we're winning arguments against you.
We're aware millions of NRA members can play safe but assholes can't; we need gun regulations against the assholes.
Sadly, you're allowing assholes to own guns & bump stocks, which is very dangerous.
Act don't refract.
70 2018-02-25 23:36:54 I agree 100% ban bump stocks. But you can not ban any firearm. It completely contridicts 2nd amedment
71 2018-02-25 23:36:54 I would be fine with a ban on bump stocks. It is pointless, but I would cede that particular hill. But, again, my point is she is passing along incorrect information.
72 2018-02-25 23:36:36 what???   pushing for AR-15 legalization and bump stocks and buying up politicians right and left has in fact hurt the country.  they opened up pandora's box with all of that.  is this lady psycho or really that stupid?
73 2018-02-25 23:36:36 Okay, how many gun owners do you think actually have bump stocks? It's just a novelty accessory. Guns aren't just made that way.
74 2018-02-25 23:35:10 Better than I would have expected. I assumed it would be someone who shorts airline stocks. Then that person could eliminate all safety elements the FAA requires.
75 2018-02-25 23:34:58 So true. We’ve had inflation in the important things for years which will choke hold real consumption growth from really being set free which keeps GDP lower than trend which keeps growth stocks beating value
76 2018-02-25 23:34:40 Mr. Trump I'm incredibly disappointed in your decision to push for the removal of bump stocks and furthering the infringements that have been and are been done against the American peoples right to bear arms if their was not a ban on machine guns no one would have needed to
77 2018-02-25 23:34:20 Disarming? USA have 2 trillion weapons per citizen in its army stocks, no need to cry about lack of weaponry or lack of safety of US citizen without the weaponry in their houses. It is said that for every million of citizen one hundred thousands are less or more psychos, scary...
78 2018-02-25 23:34:17 Send these stocks down this week sell sell sell.
79 2018-02-25 23:33:37 #Z1P #earnings result showed plenty of growth in all areas incl doubtful debts that skyrocketed as well as losses. This is a red flag for any company. Afterpay results last week showed similar spike in bad debts. Its hard to grow profits when bad debts grows that fast. #stocks
80 2018-02-25 23:33:26 No it isn't, bump stocks make the gun wildly more inaccurate. By using the recoil of the gun to make your finger pull the trigger faster, it causes less control. Honestly, the only reason why you'd want a bump stock is to waste ammo
81 2018-02-25 23:33:03 No one has said the @NRA is responsible for the shooting. The discussion is that the NRA’s lobbying arm has worked to prevent common sense legislation. I am sure bump stocks make sense to you but they are a way to skirt full auto laws to most.
82 2018-02-25 23:31:47 Missed on checking this one. Cheers. It looks to me that graphite stocks are being accumulated across asx.
83 2018-02-25 23:30:42 Thanks to all the youths learning how to fight for their rites to be safe at school! No more guns in school!! If assault style weapons, bump stocks and armoire piercing ammo were banned is a good start! Keep going guys and many many many of us r behind u!! 
84 2018-02-25 23:30:30 ..... or refusing bump stocks BUT no, the NRA comes out swinging, on the attack, stirring up drama and taking the low road.  Truth be told, your TIME is UP because these "kids" will out live all of you.  Even without that fact UR TIME is UP because America has had it with the NRA
85 2018-02-25 23:28:33 And yet, Bump-stocks are banded from The NRA’s own shooting ranges!! Kinda makes you go... Hum..
86 2018-02-25 23:26:40 Which do you think can shoot more rounds per second? Or do you think they're equal?
Which do you think is apt to be more difficult to handle accuracy wise for novices? Or do you think they're equal?
(*I forgot to add bump stocks to my original reply to you. So ARs & bump stocks*)
87 2018-02-25 23:25:56 Got my hands on pulse software and been running some scans lately. Can you have a look at BSM and let me know what you think please? There’s some accumulation going on, chart looks close to breaking out from the pennant and some news due. Graphite stocks getting primed.
88 2018-02-25 23:25:43 So let me get this straight...A Kardashian last week said that @Snapchat was no longer being used and it was BLAH. Then this week announces that they have a new App that uses @Snap? Are we are getting played by @KimKardashian and @kourtneykardash Did they by against the stocks?
89 2018-02-25 23:25:07 Agree with Ms Corin’s eloquent statement - I’m a Marine Vet- we don’t need assault weapons, bump stocks, or hi-cap magazines. We need to tighten up background checks, age to buy weapons and again address mental health and domestic assault!
90 2018-02-25 23:24:35 Civic betterment = bump stocks
91 2018-02-25 23:24:31 @AskRobinhood is there a way to up daily withdrawal limits temporarily? Normally not a problem but it introduces a ton of latency when you need to sell stocks and withdraw for a house down payment. I emailed support but the answers have been generic and not direct on this.
92 2018-02-25 23:24:17 I wish I understood betting and stocks more.
93 2018-02-25 23:23:51 Ban bump stocks, ban AR-15s which are part of the M-16 series. You DO NOT NEED an assault rifle to protect yourself. You have plenty of other options
94 2018-02-25 23:22:31 Small cap volitility is back! #Trade #Stocks #Currencies
95 2018-02-25 23:22:07 Don’t buy the product from companies if you don’t like. What a concept. How many people actually make these products? You make these products. You should get the benefit from making those products. People who do nothing, but oh stocks, should not get the bulk of the profit.
96 2018-02-25 23:20:53 OK, let’s start with AR-15s and weapons that are similar to the AR-15, but called by different names. And bump stocks and items that are similar to them but called by different names.
97 2018-02-25 23:20:04 Yeah like if you're going to write a law banning bump stocks you should prooooobably know how bump stocks work.
98 2018-02-25 23:19:57 Many republican representatives are actually against bump stocks but are still voting with it to side with party 

Notably Rubio, Zeiger, Cornyn, Flores (Flores has been supporting a state level ban though) and even Donald Trump
99 2018-02-25 23:19:48 What about banning all semi-automatic weapons & bump stocks?
What about stricter background checks?
What about age limits?
What about longer waiting periods?
What about mandatory training?
Why is it easier to buy an AR-15 than it is to get a drivers license?
100 2018-02-25 23:18:37 LETS WATCH THIER STOCKS GO INTO THE TOILET SHARE HOLDERS ARE PISSED!! MAGA
101 2018-02-25 23:17:51 There is a big distinction.  Bump stocks are terrible for control and accuracy.  Although automatics would be terrible also because of the weight of ammo you would have to carry.
102 2018-02-25 23:17:44 He doesn't own stocks, obviously.
103 2018-02-25 23:16:48 Yeah, my controller is definitely broken. I couldn’t do anything that whole second set, could’ve gotten atleast 3 more stocks :/
104 2018-02-25 23:15:22 Close background check loopholes, ban bump stocks, raise the age someone can buy any weapon to 21, mandate certified weapons safety training, no armed teachers in schools. The NRA isn't elected. Get busy & put gun regulation on the floor for debate and vote. 2018.
105 2018-02-25 23:15:15 Oh and 4) ban bump stocks
#GunReformNow #BanBumpStocks
106 2018-02-25 23:14:08 Because the NRA writes the gun legislation into state and federal law and their zero tolerance for background checks, federal database, or banning bump stocks. Because they threaten GOP lawmakers that want to break from their party line and support common sense gun control.
107 2018-02-25 23:14:05 Police carry AR15s in their patrol cars. Bump stocks are tactically worthless. Regardless of your chart, AR15s are involved in so few incidents that the FBI doesn't even track them as a separate category.
108 2018-02-25 23:13:27 I am a Republican... that isn’t dumb enough to listen to the NRA. These people are crazy and blind. The right to bare arms was for muskets... not AR-15’s and Bump Stocks.
109 2018-02-25 23:12:53 The point is, bump-stocks enhance the firing frequency of a gun. The purpose in doing this is to kill more people as shooting continues. May not be machine gun exactly but it's close.
110 2018-02-25 23:12:29 1. Rebalance (trim winners, add to losers)  2) As your account grows diversify...not just in crypto but buy stocks/pay off house/etc.
111 2018-02-25 23:12:10 “It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons -- among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals -- to measure their investment ‘risk’ by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks,” Buffett wrote.
112 2018-02-25 23:10:37 Let   absolutely clear: we are no longer going to be held hostage to a small minority of American gun nuts. Reasonable hunters and recreational shooters know that there is no purpose for assault weapons, bump stocks, cranks, etc.
113 2018-02-25 23:09:45 SIT Investment Associates’ Bryce Doty sees higher rates creating dangerous headwinds for stocks.
114 2018-02-25 23:09:40 I have my finger on the sell button if that's the case, and I don't disagree with what you say. Even @alessiorastani has warned that this is possible

115 2018-02-25 23:09:07 Not true at all! You are warping the reality. Laws are already in place to do all the things gun control activists want! Then Trump tries to meet you in the middle with bans on bump stocks improving convo between agencies and your still not happy.
116 2018-02-25 23:08:30 Had you invested in gold stocks (miners) in October 1929 you would have x6 your money, 6 years later. Had you left your money in the Dow Jones Index you'd be about 65% down.

118 2018-02-25 23:07:21 I tried an experiment today with mock-full-auto fire. For anyone who hasn't seen the videos, gun nuts are posting instructions for firing an AR-15 in simulated full-auto using a piece of string. This is their argument against banning bump stocks. 1/
119 2018-02-25 23:07:06 How are they helping with gun control efforts after Las Vegas? They squashed the attempts to ban bump stocks for goodness sake! And did you even look at that article I just showed you?
120 2018-02-25 23:07:06 As long as common ground includes  banning sells of AR-15 and Bump Stocks to civilians, I’m for it. I’m also not for arming teachers. Imagine an armed teacher accidentally killing a student during a shooter attack. Will the shooter be blamed or the teacher whose a lousy shot?
121 2018-02-25 23:06:33 You're derailing with bullshit that has absolutely nothing to do with the point at hand. Guns are created for the sole purpose of making things die. Bump stocks exist to get around machine gun bans. They need to be banned. Oreo pizza wasn't created to murder people.

125 2018-02-25 23:03:31 No doubt the NRA is driving the debate. Reagan said. No-one needs an AR to hunt. I’m PROGUN and an AR-15 is the most fun you can have with your pants on. However, u don’t need 30 rd clips, or bump stocks, or night vision scopes. The NRA brought this onPeriod

130 2018-02-25 23:00:58 @SenAngusKing Are you developing your position on bump stocks, assault weapons, and background checks in light of current events?
131 2018-02-25 23:00:34 Yes we have to do something about unstable ppl having access to guns We have to have better background checks I don’t see the need for high capacity magazines We don’t need bump stocks But no legal gun should be banned from stable ppl

136 2018-02-25 22:57:01 As a gun owner, I support banning bump stocks. ATF should never have approved their sale.  But without the bump stock, an AR only shoots one bullet at a time, just like a pistol or hunting rifle.  It isn't the number of bullets it fires per trigger pull, it's the high cap mag.
137 2018-02-25 22:56:39 You have no idea what's it's like to lose a loved one 2 a bullet. You are angry bc you see how these kids do might actually get shit changed. I guess u like bump stocks and ARs more then human life? How cynical ur sound. Scared much?

141 2018-02-25 22:53:31 @FoxNewsSunday Congresswoman states misconcieved info: Claim: Bump stocks turn assault weapons into automatic weapons. Fact: Bump stocks turn semiautomatic rifles into automatic rifles. Statement re 'clip magazines' erroneous. No such thing - two different devices.
142 2018-02-25 22:52:52 The Lies & Fear Sold by the Republicans & the NRA are the People responsible for Gun Owners believing this  Democrats have NEVER tried to take away All Guns in fact all we’ve asked is to Ban Assault Weapons AK’s & the Bump Stocks that turn them into Machine Guns. #NeverAgain
143 2018-02-25 22:52:43 I don’t believe in bashing stocks. I hold many lithium stocks. I love the sector. I sit on the BoD of a lithium company. I don’t tweet or mention it because I’m an insider. I’m not an insider on any other stock except one. I have hands on experience in milling ore. #Lithium 
144 2018-02-25 22:52:37 They banned the bump stock. I only want better background/mental health checks and unnecessary things like 20 + round magazines bump stocks etc banned. I think that be a big step

151 2018-02-25 22:50:56 I never said it was fully auto and that is how fast they can shoot . You are lying . And bump stocks are not illegal
152 2018-02-25 22:50:12 The research won't come to a halt. But we'll still have to cooperate internationally when it comes to fish stocks, if we want them to continue their recent recovery.
153 2018-02-25 22:49:24 THREAD:
Banning long guns (rifles) is not a good solution tbh. Fully automatic weapons are illegal (bump stocks should be as well), and that’s as far as it needs to go. Here is why they won’t make guns like the AR illegal (and this is just based off common sense):
154 2018-02-25 22:49:17 #BanAssaultWeaponsNow well like proabition you will just increase trafficing in the undergound. Money  to be made will always be a driving force and you know that. This is a tough decision. We don't need bump stocks.
155 2018-02-25 22:48:59 "I bought a bunch of magnets and bump stocks for when Cybil decides to be a bitch again."
156 2018-02-25 22:47:48 Common sense laws like no fly no buy are no brainers.. If you're on a FBI terrorist watch list and can't fly you should not be able to buy a gun..Bump stocks that convert a legal semi to fully automatic wich is already illegal to own..

160 2018-02-25 22:47:18 What would u do if Barron was killed in a school shooting- ban automatic weapons? Ban bump stocks?  Ban gun sales at gun shows?
161 2018-02-25 22:47:03 Next step is to ask investment companies to divest the stocks of gun companies:  Strum Rugar(RGR), American Outdoor Brands(AOBC) and Vista Outdoor(VSTO). Restrict their access to capital to restrict their business.  Might think about extending the boycott to the gun companies.
162 2018-02-25 22:46:50 What would u do if Barron was killed in a school shooting- ban automatic weapons? Ban bump stocks?  Ban gun sales at gun shows?
163 2018-02-25 22:46:21 All things that have been brought up well before your term but you will find a way that if it succeeds you will take ALL the credit, fake President. By the way ridding bump stocks will change nothing. Your so fake you listen to anything 
164 2018-02-25 22:45:34 Chris Wallace think about getting some Panel Members that know something about firearms, the Fed Gun Control Act, bump stocks (which is a BS issue). Ur bunch are just a bunch of uninformed formed talking heads.
165 2018-02-25 22:42:47 Oh not bad, half the trick I've found is getting a place that stocks most of the flavours

167 2018-02-25 22:42:12 We will see, let's check back in three months. My money is on very little happening on the Federal level. Likely only bump stocks and a small fix to the background database, just to appear to be doing something.

170 2018-02-25 22:41:29 Both are equally important. Mental healthcare improvements could assure shootings happen less often, while regulations for things like bump stocks or other weapons that can rack up a high kill count could cut heavily in the lethality of individual tragedies.
171 2018-02-25 22:41:20 Question for you ladies: if your man bought you stocks for your bday instead of that LV purse you wanted, how would you feel?
172 2018-02-25 22:40:09 Regarding bump stocks. I do think they should be regulated just like automatic weapons. But, you can do the exact same thing with a belt. Again all it does is use the recoil of the rifle to push it back forward and allow you to pull the trigger faster.
173 2018-02-25 22:40:01 Trump has already signed an order telling Congress to ban bump stocks ASAP. He has already said he wants a bipartisan deal to increase background checks. He's also said he wants them to consider raising the minimum age for assault rifles to 21. He's done more than any previous
174 2018-02-25 22:40:01 It took me a while to get but, the HUD changes the location of your percent and stocks to set areas like Melee instead of the center of the screen like Brawl & PM. BUT HOW? WITCHCRAFT!
175 2018-02-25 22:39:46 If you’re buying stocks, you shouldn’t want prices to keep rising.
176 2018-02-25 22:39:33 I've heard the president talk about raising age limits, banning bump stocks and changing waiting periods.  Where are those executive orders now?  Or is it all talk, knowing it won't pass thru congress?
177 2018-02-25 22:39:09 It is a direct charge and they don't block "even the slightest" step. Example see the support for banning bump stocks
178 2018-02-25 22:38:59 In 1791 I don't believe they were foreseeing AR-15's with bump stocks when they wrote up the second amendment. Don't think they would have wanted the common folk with them
179 2018-02-25 22:38:56 AR15s are used for hunting, and becoming more popular for big game. The 2A is not about need, it is about right. The AR15 is not a weapon of war or an assault weapon. Bump stocks can’t easily be made at home.
180 2018-02-25 22:38:40 No one absolutely NO ONE has talked about taking away the 2nd Amendment except the NRA and GOP conservatives! We only want common sense changes! No one needs an AR-15, body armor, bump stocks or smoke grenades for hunting or protection, those are all offensive weapons!
181 2018-02-25 22:38:29 Aeon, the man responsible for the Las Vegas shooting had 23 strategically placed guns in his hotel room, 12 fitted with bump stocks. He could easily switch weapons if one malfunctioned. I am for a ban on assault weapons, but appreciate different perspectives supported by logic.
182 2018-02-25 22:38:20 Thank you. I think many people may not see that, and think this is a standard AR-15.
Bump stocks have no place in modern America.
183 2018-02-25 22:38:08 To the NRA!  Nobody is trying to take your weapons away!! We just want to have changes made to the age of 21 to buy guns. Also, we want a ban on the Stocks for the semi-automatic to make an automatic constant shooting, like a machine gun. We want to save lives....don't you?
184 2018-02-25 22:37:37 Aside from boycotting companies that decide to get political, I think it would be crazy to hold their stocks... How much money did investors lose due to the political stances Starbuck or Target?
185 2018-02-25 22:36:38 It will be interesting to watch these company stocks in the future, im guessing it's going to be a drop!
186 2018-02-25 22:36:17 Also @CNN the NRA banned the bump stocks after the Vegas shooting at there ranges.  Also last time I checked Attorney General looked into bribes in Congress and the Senate.  These kids had a evil experience doesn't make them know everything.   Do research first.
187 2018-02-25 22:36:16 There is no need for most regular people to have assault weapons, large magazines, bump stocks or silencers. Sportsmen and hunters do not use them.
188 2018-02-25 22:34:52 If you’re buying stocks, you shouldn’t want prices to keep rising.

4) Certain attachments (ie. bump stocks) should be banned.
5) Require some form of training to purchase guns.

Implement these nationwide (not leaving it up to the individual states) and I guarantee it will be more successful than trying to ban guns
195 2018-02-25 22:31:56 Fyi, Dana Loesch not CEO of NRA. They do NOT promote bump stocks. They are 110% in favor of background checks. They do NOT sell guns.

197 2018-02-25 22:30:06 Hunters are no longer represented by the NRA, gun manufacturers control the NRA, a simple vote of all NRA members can prove that hunters don't use bump stocks, and hunters don't want to put 50 bullets in an elk or moose, that's crazy. Kids need health care, not guns.
198 2018-02-25 22:30:01 Except the people who loosened background checks on the mentally ill or blocked any attempts to get rid of bump stocks or limit magazine rounds. Lets not talk about any of their mistakes.
199 2018-02-25 22:29:41 Why are bump stocks still legal? We can do better than thoughts and prayers?
200 2018-02-25 22:29:11 It's amazing how much influence celebrities can have on our use of certain social media platforms. Recently, Kylie Jenner made a tweet that caused the company's stocks to plummet $1.3 billion. If more influencers follow this, will this be in the end of Snapchat? #NYUPRG18

209 2018-02-25 22:22:18 People will parse her words with a microscope, probably due to their bias against any gun control.  If that is the case, it can be mentioned that bump stocks "allow mechanical means for shooter, using correct techniques, to fire at rates comparable to full-auto."
210 2018-02-25 22:21:54 You guys keep bringing up FAT. FAT hasn’t done any metallurgical studies. I hope when they do it’s low iron. I wish that for all the lithium stocks I hold.
211 2018-02-25 22:21:32 How do you propose getting them away from the criminals? The NRA has been fighting for better background checks for years. And they were against bump stocks before anyone knew what a bump stock was. Stop listing to the people that claim they want gun control but want to kill 2A.

224 2018-02-25 22:13:49 My understanding is that the bump stock does not completely convert to fully automatic and therefore the ATF considers them legal. Only 7 states have assault weapons bans. It’s possible in those states only, bump stocks could be considered illegal.

230 2018-02-25 22:10:50 @RepMikeBishop There will be more mass shootings unless action is taken on gun control. Bump stocks, mental health issues and background checks all should be part of a package whose centerpiece is gun control.
231 2018-02-25 22:10:35 As a life long member of the NRA and a supporter of you I throw my support to your efforts re age limits. Bump stocks, background checks, NICS reform etc. Common sense that will not hurt impinge or affect gun owners and our liberties. Know u support 2A ; must also support safety.

237 2018-02-25 22:08:42 The issue with AR’s is that they seem to be the gun used in every mass shooting. So there’s something about that weapon that needs to be addressed. Regulate magazine capacities, ban bump stocks, and make the buying age 21 is a start.
238 2018-02-25 22:08:33 Keep your eye on the bond market this week. It seems the new line in the sand is the 10yr over 2.95%. On Friday an epic bond buying spree, along with dovish comments from the Fed., pushed stocks higher. It seems that market distortions will get worse. Let's be ready.

242 2018-02-25 22:06:59 @BaronVonWolfhouse that is not bullish for stocks.
243 2018-02-25 22:06:37 @BaronVonWolfhouse buffet has already said he can't find any stocks cheap enough to buy and then bought over 100 mill in treasuries.

247 2018-02-25 22:06:07 Doesn’t he know bump stocks became deregulated under Obama’s ATF?? #InOverHisHead #MediaPawn
248 2018-02-25 22:05:36 Typically the case with all the cycles, this is why debt deleverage is more efficient with stocks than in housing... typically moves 1-1 with equities
249 2018-02-25 22:04:31 Nah, not that you're bad at all! Play with blending effects and stocks until you find something you like, you'll get it :)
250 2018-02-25 22:04:28 It will be interesting to see how gun-related stocks do on the equity markets monday.
251 2018-02-25 22:04:18 There's an unfortunate common denominator between good guy and bad guy.   Hint, it's a gun.  Leave the 2a and go after bullets.  The guns become paper weights and you basically remove the need for bump stocks, scopes, silencers.  All while keeping 2a intact but with a new meaning
252 2018-02-25 22:04:01 The world awaits their view on bump stocks...
253 2018-02-25 22:03:02 Here is where your argument is going sideways: no one is calling for a ban on ALL guns. We are calling for band on semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. Keep your shot-gun. Keep your revolver. Keep your bolt action rifle. But we’re coming for your semi automatics.
254 2018-02-25 22:02:41 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!
255 2018-02-25 22:02:41 So the NRA basically created bump stocks not creative people that wanted automatic weapons but due to gun control couldn’t get them. Mistakes were made everywhere but let’s focus on rights and bully law abiding citizens
256 2018-02-25 22:02:22 They’d pay capital gains taxes when they sell their stocks. Not when they sell their house. If you’re arguing a capital gains tax on sale of primary residence would be better than this: I agree!
257 2018-02-25 22:01:22 I have 15 + years experience trading stocks, options and PENNY STOCKS  which believe it or not mimic cryto but on a smaller scale.   Follow me and ask me questions to achieve financial freedom.
258 2018-02-25 22:00:09 How quickly would her tune change if brown and black people and immigrants started buying AR-15s, High capacity clips and bump stocks?  Dana Loesch is a dumbass douche.
259 2018-02-25 21:59:54 Plus Stelter lets him blatantly lie. Congress did legislate the legality of Bump Stocks. Obama's admin ok'd them via his ATF.
260 2018-02-25 21:59:50 That is a great start if we can also get banning bump stocks/raising age/stiffer background checks/mandatory training/licenses/insurance. More can be done & fixed after Dems retake the house. VOTE Dems in if you want true reform.
261 2018-02-25 21:58:43 Trading cryptos is like taking candy from a baby in a bullish market.   Im a shark in a pool of minnows.

263 2018-02-25 21:57:48 Assault type weapons need to be banned, as should bump stocks and the like. We need a buy back program for assault type weapons . Minimum age for purchase should be 25, mandatory comprehensive background checks & a 30 day wait period and updated list of who is not allowed to own.
264 2018-02-25 21:57:01 @markminervini I just finished chapter 5 of your first book. Awesome Chapter. I can create a scan in TD to come up with the tend template stocks needing more analysis. Thanks you. Excited to finish. Book 2 waiting for me.
265 2018-02-25 21:56:12 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!

267 2018-02-25 21:55:24 A assult weapon and bump stocks,extended clips must be banned.and the assult weapons that are left there must ba a luxury tax imposed on every assult weapon, bump stock,extended clip every year. Taxex go into health care fund
268 2018-02-25 21:55:08 If $BRKB was just a levered long portfolio of stocks it’s book value would have been down a whole lot more than -9.6% in 2008.  The truth is it has outperformed hedge funds on the way up AND down, largely due to profitable float and lack of crazy fees
269 2018-02-25 21:54:23 Definition of an utterly warped sense of morality: when you attack kids who survived a mass shooting and defend people who viciously attack those who even question whether bump stocks should be banned. I guess it’s not about morality but about being oppositional no matter what.
270 2018-02-25 21:53:35 @AriMelber @AriMelberFans Question: can the president ban or regulate bum stocks (plastics)...? Can Congress?
271 2018-02-25 21:53:30 What even are stocks n why am i doin this assigment last min
272 2018-02-25 21:52:58 correct - it's a fake account
273 2018-02-25 21:52:54 Better sell these stocks and thank @POTUS for your $$ gains before they see result of anti NRA backlash. Do more research on companies you do invest in making sure they support Constitution. Be too bad for these companies to loose valuable stock prices. NOT!

Called free market.
274 2018-02-25 21:52:47 I've shared plenty with them. I know many disagree with me on this, but I'm fine raising the long gun age to 21. I agree with them on letting the ATF regulate bump stocks. I'm not sure of their position on temporary gun restraining orders, but I support that as well.
275 2018-02-25 21:52:36 Bump stocks can not be banned because that piece of plastic does not turn a gun into the definition of a machine gun (more than one bullet released with one depression of the trigger). Congress would have to make a new law. You think that’s going to happen? Will anything happen?
276 2018-02-25 21:52:25 Cont: restrictions or bans on certain high caliber auto and semi- automatic weapons (bump stocks!), restrictions on silencers, etc.
277 2018-02-25 21:52:15 Yes, it was her Intelligence Committee work and the call for banning bump stocks that keeps me in her camp.
278 2018-02-25 21:52:13 I have no bias. I support stocks I own. FAT is one of the many in my portfolio. Not the only lithium stock I hold either. I hold many.
279 2018-02-25 21:51:42 I can get onboard with the 21 age and bump stocks. Assault rifles are already banned. The problem is if these changes are made tomorrow it’s not going to stop a kid from shooting up a school Tuesday. We need more.
280 2018-02-25 21:51:28 So many biased, uninformed people on this thread. NRA doesn’t sell guns so they can’t profit from gun sales. They are not invested in bump stocks, a lot of NRA members don’t support anyone owning them. The ACLU was against the Obama EO. Maybe you think they should be eliminated?
281 2018-02-25 21:51:22 #AskWarren What is your view on investing in social media stocks?
282 2018-02-25 21:51:07 The stocks for these companies are taking a dive lmao
283 2018-02-25 21:51:04 It’s actually an argument for banning bump stocks and the like....and leaving the guns alone.  I’m not sure what you mean by ammosexual, but I’m sure it has relevant meaning in your circle.  If you present my information as an argument, you’ll be disappointed with the results lol
284 2018-02-25 21:49:47 He got sidetracked in his memorized talking points starting at the 1:36 mark, started talking about bump stocks, and repeated himself.  
He admits he's in speech and debate in school, at the end of the video.  So did the girl at the town hall, when she thanked her teacher.
285 2018-02-25 21:49:22 Paper gains in stocks are not taxed. How can you not know that?
286 2018-02-25 21:48:29 Looks like a guy that stocks up on hair gel
287 2018-02-25 21:48:15 What you might want to do is examples of different tape stocks, formats etc. to show what vhs or supervhs or beta, etc looks like
288 2018-02-25 21:47:52 @DLoesch nothing in 2A about bump stocks or even machine guns or mental illness or felony records
289 2018-02-25 21:47:24 @BeckyQuick hi Becky. I asked Warren if he would autograph a few cards for my Wall St Trading Cards series 1. I have been working on Wall St for over 30 years and this is my passion. It’s time to get the young kids active in stocks! Looking forward to your interview. #legend
290 2018-02-25 21:46:33 It's because he and his group buy before he tweets, pumps it up and dumps it on those who don't pay for his service. I'd just follow him to know which stocks to steer clear of
291 2018-02-25 21:46:08 Can't wait to see their stocks fall
292 2018-02-25 21:45:30 Agreed. She is truly happy. Now can we talk about better Background Chks for Violent offenders, mentally ill, Ban Bump stocks. Clearly it's not an assualt weapon. Our Scouts shoot 22's with professionals and then go fishing once a year. There are Merit Badges to earn at camp.
293 2018-02-25 21:44:40 Trump lied & said Dems want to take away your 2nd amemdments rights. Not true. The 2nd amendment does not give u rights to all guns. The government can regulate them. A Nuclear weapon is an arm/as in arms race. U don't have rights 2 all weapons. Ban automatic guns/ bump stocks.
294 2018-02-25 21:41:40 I see you changed your name. Good to meet you Mr. The NRA Today. I ant join them b/c their push to ban bump stocks. But, with libs hating on them they are having to fight like they have not in years.
295 2018-02-25 21:41:15 Yet most of those new members still agree on assault rifles bans, bump stocks bans and raising the age to 21 to purchase a gun.  The funny thing is no one is taking all guns away even though that is the safest choice to make.
296 2018-02-25 21:40:26 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around

298 2018-02-25 21:39:47 The children today need education and passion to own stocks for the future. I am building a base set of Wall St trading cards and would love to add autographs of stock mkt icons. Would Warren spare his auto on a few cards?  #AskWarren @CNBC @SquawkCNBC @BeckyQuick

301 2018-02-25 21:38:45 @SenToomey @SenCasey If you don’t vote to 1)improve and increase background checks; 2)raise the age limit for all guns; 3)ban bump stocks; and 4)ban assault style weapons such as the AR-15 kiss your seats in the @SenateGOP @SenateDems goodbye. We’ve had enough @NRA bullshit.
302 2018-02-25 21:37:55 What if we could persuade major credit card companies to refuse transactions for purchase of assault style weapons and add-ons (think bump stocks) that make ordinary firearms into military-style weapons?
303 2018-02-25 21:36:54 Thanks for running this through your follower base.  If other pension funds and others with portfolios containing gun stocks follow Blackstone’s lead, it will hit NRA contributors where it really hurts—asset value.

306 2018-02-25 21:34:16 Bump stocks need to be banned, too.
307 2018-02-25 21:33:18 I understand that unemployment is up and stocks are up but unemployment has been rising since 2010 consistently so that’s nothing new. And my point about jobs is that we are loosing a significant amount overseas. The most in 5 years.
308 2018-02-25 21:31:46 Everyone agrees to banning bump stocks and even your nemesis Trump is moving on it.
309 2018-02-25 21:31:41 Stocks on this one still?
310 2018-02-25 21:31:37 I have no problem with no bump stocks but I also have no problem with someone who has lawfully passed the right to own firearms   Meaning they passed an FBI background check. PERIOD.
311 2018-02-25 21:31:30 Our citizens aren't allowed to possess guns. The police has guns but ironically some cases they used their own to commit suicide.  Mental illness is unavoidable in any society, if bump stocks are allowed in a small country with condensed population, it's just bullshit.
312 2018-02-25 21:31:22 False response! Gun laws get tougher and tougher! This time so far bump stocks will be outlawed! How is it getting easier! Disingenuous! Chicago very tough! Not working! Bad guys always have guns! They don’t comply with any laws!

315 2018-02-25 21:29:46 Blaming the object for how it's used is the most idiotic thing I've seen. So should people who are heavy-set scream that spoons make them fat? I don't think so. I will agree that there should be stricter requirements to own such a weapon and bump stocks should be banned
316 2018-02-25 21:29:35 It's no more of a conspiracy than food stamps. 

Someone I know is a lawyer for a big bank. He is prohibited from buying stocks, crypto currency, etc. He makes a ton of money. Has to put it into USD based bonds.

The bank he works for does all kinds of shady shit.

323 2018-02-25 21:26:22 Made a ton of money buying and selling stocks. To learn more, call me. Im just a few digits away :)
324 2018-02-25 21:26:21 The fact that bump stocks are legal in the vast majority of states renders your original “illegally modified” comment incorrect.
325 2018-02-25 21:26:20 But meanwhile stocks have soared.
326 2018-02-25 21:23:35 Why are people still hung up on #guncontrol the ammo kills. So #ammocontrol is what we need no ones right get taken away. Still have rights to arms. Just make the sells of ammo/supplies be reported and any large amounts get checked out. Ban bump stocks and binary triggers.
327 2018-02-25 21:23:16 ED I am said: America Trump GOP Pull out NAFTA TPP, Trump no greater deal stocks Fall  12-1-16, 12-17-16, 2 at 1-22-17 & 6-1-17!!!
328 2018-02-25 21:23:04 YES to background checks (including gun shows!)  YES to ending Bump Stocks.  YES to Mental Health checks. Sorry...don't agree on age 21.  NRA member.
329 2018-02-25 21:22:32 I think it’s about time I get back into stocks now that crypto is so poppin’
330 2018-02-25 21:20:43 I’m asking my financial guy to look at my holdings and drop all gun manufacturers and related stocks.  Who’s with me?
331 2018-02-25 21:20:05 So, Warren Buffett’s annual shareholder letter cautions people not to borrow money to buy stocks. Shouldn’t this be obvious? If he’s taking the time to say it, I guess it isn’t. (By the way I’d throw all cryptocurrencies into that too.)
332 2018-02-25 21:19:11 Dump FEDEX stocks and don’t use Fedex for your packages.
333 2018-02-25 21:17:25 not only that but a president use a tragedy to get good press for himself. the DOJ looked into banning bump stocks 5 years ago and found that they don't have the legal grounds to. has to go through congress. but it got him good press
334 2018-02-25 21:16:18 Bitcoin stocks are lowkey disappointing for the moment
335 2018-02-25 21:16:14 He hasn't banned bump stocks.  He's told DoJ to ban them but it would be more effective if Congress passed a law & he did not do it after Vegas.  He held a forum where he had a cheat sheet that reminded him to listen. He's cutting health care including school counseling. Come on.
336 2018-02-25 21:15:06 Bill I just want you to know I made a fair amount of money selling my FedEx stocks and buying up stocks I want to thank the NRA and FedEx for my windfall
337 2018-02-25 21:14:44 No, we shouldn't ban hangguns. But we should ban bump stocks,
338 2018-02-25 21:14:43 But first stocks will rise 30% in the run up to 4.5% yield on the 10-year treasury so...
339 2018-02-25 21:14:05 I agree with a lot of this. More gun bans has never really been the answer other than the obvious crack down on automatic weapons and bump stocks which are done or in the works. Problem is many 2a supporters will say controlling who gets guns more strictly violates the 2a.
340 2018-02-25 21:13:01 I am a gun owner, and think we need better regulation. I have fired an M16 many times, and fired a friends AR15. It was a lot of fun; however, I don’t see the need for civilians to own one. Bump stocks, etc, are not needed either.
341 2018-02-25 21:12:47 Left couldnt wait to jump on this to raise $. What will they do once POTUS announces gun law changes? What will they have to scream about then? What did ObUmmEr do other than approve bump stocks for sale LEGALLY?
342 2018-02-25 21:12:19 Bill miller from leg mason value fund has interesting thesis... stocks can rally based on bonds to stock rotation...
343 2018-02-25 21:12:14 He is acting, he held a forum listening to victims of these shootings, he's banned bump stocks and he will most likely be reforming the way we treat mental illness in America.
344 2018-02-25 21:11:01 NRA supports restriction on Bump Stocks.

Always has.

Kid's a liar.
345 2018-02-25 21:10:51 U seeing anything in spx? Do u plan on covering/selling sqqq this week if stocks rally past a certain level? I’m thinking of getting rid of sqqq. Too hard to be bearish this week. Would rather ride tmf and get bearish stocks when they are higher. Thoughts?
346 2018-02-25 21:10:35 @SquawkCNBC 
Your letter says that in the long-term stocks are less riskier than bonds. If so, then should there be an equity risk premium vs bonds? When would stocks be less attractive than bonds? 
#AskWarren
347 2018-02-25 21:09:14 How about a head for the ATF so the current laws can be enforced? How about not blocking research studies, how about banning bump stocks. Sam-how has the NRA helped you? When has anyone tried to limit your legal gun usage/purchasing?
348 2018-02-25 21:08:35 Obama approved bump stocks for sale in the United States
349 2018-02-25 21:07:18 @SEC_News @secactions @SEC_Enforcement
In microcap stocks bids that are  large generate buying on the ask, however when market makers fill the orders at the bid, those bids instantly appear on the ask blocking stalling any upward movement. 1 tick flippers or MM manipulation. Fix
350 2018-02-25 21:07:10 Same. May as well grab a drink and talk stocks when I get back mid march.
351 2018-02-25 21:06:46 You've said it!  It is in print and provable when your try to deny it.  We, the voters, are going to hold you #POTUS to your promise of background checks, age limits, and ending sale of Bump Stocks.
352 2018-02-25 21:06:06 thanks. found uscff, but the other two aren't OTC stocks
353 2018-02-25 21:05:08 recently returned to trading stocks, very 1st thing I relearned was trade the stock regardless what the overall indexes are doing. 

If you r thinking that most stocks follow the indexes, that is true but if the wasn’t an edge to individual stock picking I wouldn’t be doing it
354 2018-02-25 21:04:44 Just to be fair here. The AR-15 does NOT fall under the definition of an Assault Rifle. But, that doesn't affect my opinion that it needs to be banned for civilian use. Even if bump-stocks are banned, the use of one with an AR-15 gives it the simulated action of a machine gun.
355 2018-02-25 21:04:25 President raised age to buy firearms and wants to ban bump stocks. I'm sure you want to give up your rights. That's you. I don't. If FBI had done their job that school shooting would never have happened! FACT!
356 2018-02-25 21:03:24 If I recall it was a semi automatic weapon with a bumo stock. And they are trying to ban those now if I remember hearing correctly. Bump stocks help someone shoot a semi automatic weapon like a fully automatic. You would have to look it up to fully understand. Hard to explain lol
357 2018-02-25 21:03:05 FFS....the NRA never passed legislation on bump stocks.....the OBAMA justice department deemed them legal!!
358 2018-02-25 21:02:48 Shar... The ATF gave its seal of approval for Bump Stocks under the Obama administration in 2010. The ATF concluded they do not make a weapon full automatic. Regardless, it still doesn't make an AR-15 an assault rifle. Accurate definitions are important when it comes to law.

360 2018-02-25 21:02:20 No reason to trade the cryptos when you have stocks like $nvda $ba, $googl $lmt $amznandotger that move vociferously almost every day. $simple
361 2018-02-25 21:02:02 Yesterday I had a FB conversation with a self ID'd conservative railing about "common sense" gun laws and liberals wanting to ban all guns. He went on to say he was in favor of strengthened background, checks, banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
362 2018-02-25 21:01:52 Last year we expected 20% earnings growth in 2017 and stocks went up 20%. But now it turns out earnings grew 10%. Shouldn't market go down when reality doesn't match the original promise?
363 2018-02-25 21:01:38 Automatic weapons and bump stocks should be restricted to the military and law enforcement agencies ONLY.
364 2018-02-25 21:01:11 A good laptop or pc is the sole best investment you will make in 2018. And studying crypto currencies or stocks would definatley be second. Do not procrastinate over this madness, people are turning £1000 into 1,000,000 in a year
365 2018-02-25 20:59:39 1. Take out all the high velocity guns, see what you have left. Make bump stocks & homemade devices w/same purpose illegal. Perhaps require manufacturers to make it even harder to make a semi act like an automatic. Those are just some rambling ideas.
366 2018-02-25 20:58:35 Americans stop your half measures. Banning bump stocks and raising age limits will not work. You need to ban all firearms, period. Your country is sick and needs a drastic change. Dems & Republicans have let you down. Stop the insanity.

370 2018-02-25 20:56:34 Amazing logic.  In face of such a towering intellect, I concede defeat and humbly retract everything I ever wrote.  Just one final advice: consider investing in pumped up penny stocks.  They too have "value from outside the system only", but the exchanges at least are reliable.

378 2018-02-25 20:53:09 Hence the reason to buy low and se high. Also, ‘stocks’ is too generic.
379 2018-02-25 20:52:46 1/ x Omg this kid is so dumb...

The NRA did not get bump stocks approved. That was done by the ATF under the Obama Administration

The NRA is not in league with the gun manufacturers, if anything loose gun regs are actually bad for manufacturers because then demand is low.
380 2018-02-25 20:52:21 Even with timeouts the game is simple. You're either going to beat me because you were able to take both my stocks, or lose because you couldn't.
381 2018-02-25 20:51:31 like liquid stocks with higher daily volume and prefer over $20 per share will and have traded less expensive names.
382 2018-02-25 20:51:29 its almost impossible for a regular person to buy a automatic. the few people who can, usually own a gun shop. i think to many of the idiots confuse bump stocks, and fast hands with a automatic.
383 2018-02-25 20:51:25 4) The NRA condemned the sale of bump stocks while the obama admin approved the sale of them
384 2018-02-25 20:50:57 These things will happen because, no matter how hard you try guns will exist it is always the person's fault thank you for your opinion we should have more restrictions but also bump stocks are to make single shot or burst fire fast and they are hard to find not to common though.
385 2018-02-25 20:50:50 They included the late Solomon Humes, a lay bishop with the non-denominational Church of God of Prophecy.[1] From 2002 until 2007, the fund averaged 116% annual returns, holding blue chip stocks in Apple Inc., Unilever and Coca-Cola.[6]
386 2018-02-25 20:50:36 Sales, earnings, cash, LDI, buybacks, etc. There are too many tail winds for stocks to pull back right now. Then again, sometimes the market doesn’t give a crap.
387 2018-02-25 20:50:09 I think it speaks to the importance of trying to keep a diversified farm operation which can be also be difficult, it’s like the stock market, if you invest in 2 stocks and they both hit a down trend things don’t look so good.  Off farm jobs can be a way of diversifying
388 2018-02-25 20:50:05 Not enough, Senator. Need one bill to #BanAssaultWeapons #BanHighCapacityMagazines #GVRO #StandardWaitingPeriod #NoFireArmsUnder21 as well as banning bump stocks #GoBold

391 2018-02-25 20:48:12 Did bump stocks get approved under obama?
392 2018-02-25 20:47:49 it's possible bond rally and stocks don't or pull back. Not always correlated
393 2018-02-25 20:46:39 Q: How do you know when stocks are getting cheap?
A: Wall Street is called Wal-Mart Street.
394 2018-02-25 20:46:26 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenSanders      Just an AR-15 on steroids  (bump stocks). Looks like an assault rifle to me.
395 2018-02-25 20:44:55 i smell a market meltdown on the feet of the MJ stocks. It is insane. Look to $glh ! 100x less than Canopy?
396 2018-02-25 20:44:47 The main issue is being able to change a semi automatic to full with bump stocks and the amount of ammo a magazine can hold. In Canada it’s 5 America it’s 100
397 2018-02-25 20:43:20 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!
398 2018-02-25 20:43:03 Bump stocks is a working issues in regards to Vegas shooting. So how sure are you that a 19 years old won't won't wait couple years before he can do mass shooting. 3 years security.

403 2018-02-25 20:40:35 We want assault rifles banned. Not just bump stocks. #NeverAgain #BanAssaultWeapons
404 2018-02-25 20:40:02 We ban bump stocks because one maniac uses one in a crime?
We check shoes at the gate because one terrorist tried something?
What happens when a terrorist shoves a bomb up their ass?
Stop with the irrational knee jerk reactions that do nothing but punish the law abiding.

406 2018-02-25 20:38:48 Conservative yes. Hand guns are 21 make the AR and assault rifles 21. Get rid of rapid fire aids like bump stocks. Have metal detectors,armed guards,some armed teachers/staff. Enforce current laws & strengthen BGCs. A mixed bag of both sides, compromise.
407 2018-02-25 20:37:40 And yet he backs a state ban on bump stocks? I fail to see how this isn’t inconsistent. 

Seems like he’s try to soften his previous public statements against an assault weapons ban with a convenient new qualifier.
408 2018-02-25 20:37:10 We need to get all of these military type weapons AND bump stocks out of the hands of the civilian people. The ONLY people that should have these weapons are the BRAVE men and women that are serving our country
409 2018-02-25 20:37:05 They were top dog for quite awhile, people moved on, they started screeching and picking fights poorly, now they're laughing stocks and they literally can't handle that.
410 2018-02-25 20:37:04 Yet you propose to ban bump stocks. Sounds counter to what you just said.
411 2018-02-25 20:36:55 Income tax certainly was
412 2018-02-25 20:36:52 I stated thus: "Shares with a market cap of less than £150 million may be found on the Alternative Investment Market. These are known as MICRO-CAP stocks" That is factually correct.
413 2018-02-25 20:36:25 Who’d have thought (i) buying stocks when prices fall & holding; (ii) never paying high fees to asset managers; (iii) favouring stocks v bonds over the long term; (iv) taking concentrated & active positions and (v) being commercially tough (because he certainly is) would work? 
414 2018-02-25 20:36:13 Extensive background checks for every gun sold, regardless where sold/purchased including private person to person, ban bump stocks, raise age to 21 for ownership of guns with exception to hunting rifles. Personally, I'd like to see a ban on future sales of AR-15's
415 2018-02-25 20:36:01 RT @SenFeinstein: Accessories like bump stocks allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns. The ONLY way to guarantee these dangerous devices are taken off the streets is to pass my bill. #BanBumpStocks

417 2018-02-25 20:35:32 This is so fucked up, anyone who has ever defended these bump stocks is a horrible person.
418 2018-02-25 20:34:46 Bro, we’re having trouble getting congress to legislate bump stocks. In what universe would any congress ever ban handguns? Grow up. I grew up in a house full of guns. There’s no need to own an AR-15 other than for shits and giggles and mass shootings.
419 2018-02-25 20:34:34 I swear listening to him you wanna invest in some stocks settle down start a family and drop 5k on a necklace 
420 2018-02-25 20:33:47 NRA membership is not publicly available, so there is no reliable way to say, but again, it's not NRA members but rather leadership that rightfully deserve blame here.  They actively oppose even common sense regulation. Vegas was Oct 1, why aren't bump stocks illegal yet?
421 2018-02-25 20:33:47 Maybe a new vocabulary is necessary so we can group assault weapons with gun stocks  and without gun stocks in the same category. The NRA will try anything to protect their assault weapons. Let’s rename them WMD. (weapons of mass destruction) and BAN them all.
422 2018-02-25 20:33:18 All semi auto guns can achieve rapid fire through bump firing, not only with stocks, by simply gettibg your finger in a hook like postiion and pulling it horizontally to make a ridiculous trigger finger, you can make a pistol fire as fast as an ar, it's either ban or not ban
423 2018-02-25 20:33:16 I don't think bump stocks are worth the $$, but what did this shooting have to do with bump stocks?
424 2018-02-25 20:32:12 My understanding is that the most recent shooter set off a fire alarm and brought his victims outside to him. Don't see what a metal detector could do there. Best solution is to end the production of AR-15 and bumper stocks.

432 2018-02-25 20:29:32 As @CashQuestions says... 

Tax is too complicated and getting more so (e.g. need to declare interest rather than taxed at source).

One mans 'exemption' is anothers 'but it wasn't designed for that purpose'. 

Am I right in thinking VAT was temporary?????
433 2018-02-25 20:29:17 @NJEA is it true our pension fund has stock in gun stocks? Time to reevaluate and divest . I don’t want my pension money financing gun manufacturers!
434 2018-02-25 20:28:50 Why can't the solution be comprised of multiple solutions? 

Stronger background checks
Closing the gun show loophole
Banning bump stocks
Mental health
Stronger security at schools

Sick and tired of right wing and NRA obstinacy and defections!

437 2018-02-25 20:27:52 While it's true that there are a lot of guns that wouldn't be banned the big difference in my mind is the magazine capacity and rate of fire. How about we start with laws that restrict magazine size and outlaw bump stocks as well as more stringent background checks
438 2018-02-25 20:27:03 Quite the opposite. The EU inherited massive problems with overfished resources and declining fish stocks. Only now are we seeing this turn around. Now you want to deregulate catches and undo that?

You are mad.
439 2018-02-25 20:26:28 Says you! Tweeting from Liverpool airport  xxx
440 2018-02-25 20:26:28 Jacob, the NRA has taken no action whatsoever to ban bump stocks in its long history. Am I correct that a bump stock can make semi-automatic weapons the equivalent of automatic weapons? So am I correct that the NRA has no position against teens with automatic-equivalent weapons?
441 2018-02-25 20:25:50 It's EU programmes to manage the recovery of fish stocks and money for UK fishing fleets to modernise (money not forthcoming from UK government) that has slowed decline & started to increase.

Plus, whilst fish catches decreased, type has also changed & values increased.

444 2018-02-25 20:24:42 I’m not giving up jack squat by giving up bump stocks. I didn’t give up my right to self defense and bear arms by not having a machine gun.

451 2018-02-25 20:21:40 It was obvious when this guy was pumping the same dead stocks. Every times he said big buying was coming there was big selling. I don’t think he fooled that many traders.
452 2018-02-25 20:21:09 I will agree with you on one thing, ban bump stocks. As far as your so-called weapons of war, AR15's are not. They are not even a large caliber rifle. There are far more deadly weapons available to purchase.
453 2018-02-25 20:20:51 Bump stocks were approved by the Obama administration @davidhogg111
454 2018-02-25 20:19:10 Like I said earlier people that plan to boycotting the NRA haven’t done their figures just because you don’t belong to the NRA by paying for a membership doesn’t mean you don’t support them and they have a lot of supporters good luck with boycott stocks should start dropping
455 2018-02-25 20:19:09 I own several guns and refuse to join the NRA because I don't need them telling me I 'need' an AR to 'honor the 2nd amendment'. And telling me I need police ammo, armor piercing bullets, silencers, bump stocks. I'm not a member of an army, and can think for myself. #NONRA
456 2018-02-25 20:19:06 they're not winning though,  what legislation is being brought to the floor out Congress? The only changes I've heard are things like banning bump stocks which I can make in my house, so that won't do a thing.
457 2018-02-25 20:19:03 I agree that we need to put something better in place and that’s what’s happening. Trump is putting a ban on bump stocks and raising the age limit to 21 for all guns. As the the assault weapon ban, the average citizens can’t own an AK-47 or an M16 without special permits.

468 2018-02-25 20:14:23 The snarling face of the NRA came out against a ban on bump stocks, a device designed specifically to subvert existing gun laws.  Tell me again how sincerely the NRA wants us to enforce existing gun laws. xg.twitter

472 2018-02-25 20:13:09 Indeed. Take breaks and get outside for the fresh air. Also try to remember that what they are trying to ban are assault weapons and bump stocks. Yes it’s a stepping stone but I still don’t think it will happen. Patriots will fight to keep their 2A right.

479 2018-02-25 20:06:35 Your statement is absolutely false. You've bought into the NRA's lies. I feel sorry for you.  And also: all we want is the AR-15 (used in every mass shooting) banned, bump stocks banned, and extensive background checks made. That's it. Again, I feel sorry for you.

481 2018-02-25 20:06:06 This is the part you gun owners are oblivious to.Nobdy wants to take all ur guns away all these incidents need action if not its only gonna get worse and it will be the end of us.Start with Uni Backround chk /Gun show loop holes /Bump stocks/Huge ammo cartridges that u donot need
482 2018-02-25 20:05:55 Theres a local restsurant by rs Shad thats pays 4 your piss but u must have been on a bender for 3 to 4 days then piss into a container for a full day then they buy it. The use it for stocks for ther homemade stews & soups & also make custard out of it. Great place to unwind
483 2018-02-25 20:05:37 Feel a lot of the health/biotech stocks all have similar charts... hope your right
484 2018-02-25 20:05:32 I did not know they had managed to buy that much of Twitter, I know when they bought a chunk of FB they where trying to buy stocks in Twitter. People really need to wake up. Ty for the information.
485 2018-02-25 20:05:08 TD are v good for international stocks. I hold it in my ISA!
486 2018-02-25 20:04:58 You have fired your strong loyal people and let the dumb ignorant ones stay like Sessions. Omg are we in the twilight zone? Like you said common since. Bump stocks are gone. Just do that and let congress debate the backgrounds and mental illness
487 2018-02-25 20:04:16 Oxo stocks #awfullybritishtorturetechniques
488 2018-02-25 20:04:06 I'll have to read up on bump stocks.  Not sure how this increases fire rate.  Measure 3300 ft per second x (62) Squared)) = Energy and 2770 x (180) squared.  check out the energy differential.  you'll be supprised.  The 223 was designed to cause casualties mor than deaths
489 2018-02-25 20:03:48 as far as safe stocks that look good from multiple angles, I'd have to go with $GOOG right here.   Moat, monopoly, etc.
490 2018-02-25 20:03:38 Is that where those "bump stocks" people are all pissed off about come into account?
491 2018-02-25 20:03:19 You people are the worst. The only thing that differentiates a semiauto civilian AR-15 type rifle from the M4 our soldiers use is ability to shoot full auto. And with things like bump stocks you can essentially shoot one full auto. Calling these weapons assault rifles is correct
492 2018-02-25 20:03:15 Quit with fascist...
Some say GOP is fascist in the more traditional sense of the term in relation to nationalism, xenophobia, etc.
But I know many  in it are not fascist
So I don't say that.
You persist in using inflammatory labels which don't fit. 

Lies re bump stocks?
493 2018-02-25 20:03:01 Go ahead and ban bump stocks, but an AR-15 is nothing more than a modernized version of a rifle. Do you want to give up your latest version of an I phone for a flip phone? Same difference. Leave it alone.  @POTUS
494 2018-02-25 20:01:01 #askwarren Would you sell income property and invest in stocks?
495 2018-02-25 19:58:31 searching for bump stocks in the first place, clearly
496 2018-02-25 19:58:29 banning bump stocks is like putting a finger bandage on a fractured limb. bump firing is not that hard and can be learned. this isn't cynicism: if we're to overcome the patriarchal sickness that is american gun culture, we need to think bigger and further.
497 2018-02-25 19:57:02 Did I miss something? Was #NikolasCruz using a bump stock? Has there been one #American mass shooting done with a bump stock equipped weapon? The answer is no. So why other than politically correct bulls*** are we talking about bump stocks?
498 2018-02-25 19:56:57 And if the 10Y hit 20%, stocks would go down a lot more...I mean what's the point of this wo giving a probability of the 10Y hitting 4.5% in 10 months time...it's sort of meaningless

"if a meteor hit earth and wiped out two continents...the market may go down"
499 2018-02-25 19:56:32 They. Don’t. Have. To. Move. 

And if they made this paper gain anywhere but the housing market (like stocks) they’d be paying way more taxes than this.
500 2018-02-25 19:55:36 I can’t go and buy a beer cause im not 21 but I can go and get an AR15 234 rounds, bump stocks lol the fuck is wrong with these laws

504 2018-02-25 19:53:18 And extra bump stocks too, I see a profit potential here.
505 2018-02-25 19:52:55 I use @CharlesSchwab...I am happy with them, it is not their fault stocks are not very stable right now..
506 2018-02-25 19:52:13 Yo @vladstocks this @vlad_stocks has nothing to do with you right?
507 2018-02-25 19:51:55 tellement la flemme de chercher des stocks^^ j'en ai un sur les bahams c'est bon j'ai pas changer pour le moment^^
508 2018-02-25 19:51:22 Oh boy. Here we go with this crap. Load up on shot guns, pistols and just about whatever else your heart desires. But semi autos and bump stocks should just go away. Be sensible.
509 2018-02-25 19:50:56 That’s not from the ATF letters. And in any event, affirming the stocks were legal does not mean approving their sale to the masses. I ask again, where in the Obama ATF letters do you see that they approved of the sale of bump stock?
510 2018-02-25 19:50:11 si t'as des stocks balances;)
511 2018-02-25 19:49:22 Most of what Gov Scott says I agree with. Assault rifles and bump stomp stocks need to go
512 2018-02-25 19:48:45 Guten Abend, vor uns liegen die letzten drei Handelstage im Februar, wahrscheinlich wird sich in Summe keine pos Monatsperformance für die Börsen mehr ausgehen.... #stocks, #trading
513 2018-02-25 19:48:36 Music whom'st buy like out of control stocks .   
514 2018-02-25 19:46:48 No, he’ll cave to pressure and lower the age to buy a gun to 8yrs, make bump stocks mandatory on semi autos, and stop background checks altogether.
515 2018-02-25 19:46:14 Educate. Semantics suck. What we want is the ban on all SEMIautomatic weapons. Weapons of war. What we want is a ban on bump stocks. What we want is to raise limit to 21. Amnesty and buy back for all semi owners. Tougher background checks. Common sense. #BanSemiAutomaticGuns
516 2018-02-25 19:45:05 Lol bump stocks have to be regulated through Congress. The ATF can’t do it, you dummy.
517 2018-02-25 19:45:05 so don't blow it Dems.  More companies boccotting NRA everyone will be on board  Go all the way.  Assult weapons, bump stocks, long waiting periods, better background checks,  more money for interfacing intelligence local and Federal.  then tackle immigrants. no blkmail from GOP
518 2018-02-25 19:44:41 Think I could probably make more sense of the Apple Stocks app than I could of new Snapchat
519 2018-02-25 19:44:38 I'm not defending bump stocks at all. I don't see the point in them. I'm a gun owner but I don't see the use for them.
520 2018-02-25 19:43:06 I feel that the crypto run corresponding with people getting together and talking pot stocks over the holidays contributed.
521 2018-02-25 19:41:42 Yes I agree very high powered weapon. I was just simply stating that’s not what the kids heard the video above is with the bump stock thank god the shooter didn’t have a bump stock. Bump stocks need to be go forsure
522 2018-02-25 19:41:16 One man in Las Vegas murdered 58 people & injured 500.  A teen in Florda murdered 17 students & teachers & wounded many more. AR-15s, military grade ammo extended clips, bump stocks and someone hell-bent on killing can do a lot of damage. We're talking exponentials, not members.
523 2018-02-25 19:39:53 I said to @Jherane_, "all I want for my birthday is socks", and she went out and got me stocks. 

Now here I am, stockful and sockless.
524 2018-02-25 19:38:42 Jeezass F Krist on a kaiser, do you know how to read? Where the hell have you been? No one said anything about the 2nd Amendment going anywhere. All we want is assault/military style weapons & bump stocks banned & stronger background checks. We've said it 1000 times. Get with it
525 2018-02-25 19:38:24 For those looking at their 401k and gun stocks, VSMAX has another issue, owning 2.5% of Chemours, as well as 2.5% or so of Sturm Ruger.

Haven't looked closely at the alternative social index fund yet, VFTSX.

#GenX
526 2018-02-25 19:38:03 Oh, ban the bump stocks also. Sorry
527 2018-02-25 19:36:06 Part of the company value is based on what would happen if they sold all their stocks.  The amount that they would raise rose in December when the tax code changed and reduced the tax they would pay on those profits.
528 2018-02-25 19:34:58 @JWadeTaylor HEY STUPID THE BRA AND ALL OF US ARE AGAINST BUMP STOCKS. DO YOUR HOMEWORK FIRST BEFORE YOU GET ON HERE LOOKING STUPID.
529 2018-02-25 19:34:32 Yes Vanguard would be one. They have stocks with all the Gun manufactures probably with triple A ratings. Nothing like a system of greed over the #killing of children.
530 2018-02-25 19:34:13 Bump stocks - Vegas shooting. I shouldn’t have to educate you here.
531 2018-02-25 19:34:04 Any faith in $FIEC still?
532 2018-02-25 19:33:47 Absolutely. Start with a national database that houses all guns, accessories like bump stocks, ammunition & the background check should be in there as well. Annually, people should have to do a psychological evaluation to renew their permit, if they fail, confiscate their guns.
533 2018-02-25 19:33:38 POTUS said he will support banning bump stocks, enhance background checks and up the purchase age. Where are the Dem?  Our Rep Ted Deutch said a ban on bump stocks should have been introduced immediately. Is he speaking to the president right now?  Let see how this plays out.
534 2018-02-25 19:32:49 Got mine and holding strong
535 2018-02-25 19:32:48 #AskWarren You say bonds will lose money.  Would preferred stocks be a good replacement for the bond allocation in a conservative portfolio?
536 2018-02-25 19:32:45 For what?  Despite the lies, it was not the ATF nor President Obama who "allowed" bump stocks, it was the Republican Congress - only Congress can create new laws.  Civics is not your strong suit is it?
537 2018-02-25 19:32:03 We can't buy a bazooka, a machine gun or hand grenades. We don't need bump stocks or AR 15s for 18 yr olds.
538 2018-02-25 19:31:31 One last thing, I absolutely love taking stocks early in doubles. It’s incredibly fun more so than taking them in singles.
539 2018-02-25 19:31:04 "When stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I've bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then they later went to $30. You just don't know when you can find the bottom."
Peter Lynch
540 2018-02-25 19:30:49 Now, 1) "strengthening background checks" is a meaningless term. 2) people with a history of violent criminal activity are already banned from possessing or buying guns. 3). the no-fly list is a due process issue. 4). bump stocks are a joke. Nothing more than a distraction.
541 2018-02-25 19:30:40 DACA - implemented Unconstitutionally by Dems

Not perfect but a start.
546 2018-02-25 19:29:57 *Change the laws that prevent the CDC from studying gun violence.
*immediate ban on bump stocks, magazines with greater than 20 rd capacity.
*no firearms sales to ppl under 21.
*criminal and mental health background checks.
*fund the ATF.
547 2018-02-25 19:29:43 Ok how about scanning items on a check out line or someone who stocks shelves in comparison to a RNA or a welder. etc.  
and I worked in McDonalds as a child and it was easy.  I got out of poverty by joint the military at 17 and then going to school while working full time
548 2018-02-25 19:29:42 If u think there is a reason for bump stocks or a reason why an 18 yr ols can buy an AR 15, u r seriously impaired
549 2018-02-25 19:29:19 And to that we’ll find out.   Though bump stocks are range toys and you can fight an die for your country before you have earned your rights,  let us see the damage this will cause to the law abiding citizen
550 2018-02-25 19:28:38 Truth - without Congress acting to limit or eliminate access to specific weapons, ammunition, or accessories, there is little law enforcement can do.  Despite the lies, it was not the ATF nor President Obama who "allowed" bump stocks, it was the Republican Congress.
551 2018-02-25 19:28:32 You do know the NRA banned bump stocks on all it's ranges and is in favor of banning them right ? This has been their position for sometime. No fan of the NRA but FFS let's tone down the rhetoric and find a solution instead of yelling at each other.
552 2018-02-25 19:27:52 Where do you think this leads? Bump stocks have zero correlation with school shootings. Banning them won’t stop shootings.

So, what do you give up next? What is after bump stocks? Which thing will stop the shootings and appease the Left?
553 2018-02-25 19:27:48 Yes there should be. And bump stocks. There is no legitimate reason, at all, for a civilian to own multiple weapons of war that are made solely to kill dozens of people.
554 2018-02-25 19:27:03 I wish the sensible decent members would leave the NRA which no longer embraces sensible ownership.Maybe someone will start a new Assoc that embraces *strong universal background cks 
*Ban of any military Semi automatic weapons bump stocks
*Require age limits
*End loopholes
555 2018-02-25 19:27:00 Then it seems to me an easy way to make bump stocks useless is to ban all weapons they can be used on. You wouldn't have to "fiddle" with any rules or definitions.
556 2018-02-25 19:25:56 I'm not against guns just military weapons with or without bump stocks
557 2018-02-25 19:25:47 "Assault Weapon" is a legal definition that in most jurisdictions focuses on a set of miltary-style cosmetic details - folding stocks, pistol grips, flash hiders, bayonet lugs, etc. - rather than the core features: semi-automatic function and high capacity magazines. 2/2
558 2018-02-25 19:25:25 Only be a matter of time before stocks gets knocked again or even wore shabes
559 2018-02-25 19:25:16 Order any of these for Mothers Day and get a free Belgian chocolate tulip. Whilst stocks last as we only have a limited supply so be quick!
560 2018-02-25 19:24:16 I've also seen multiple posers and posters incorrectly assume that the "AR" in AR-15 stands for assault rifle, and that scary black guns are more dangerous than those with wooden stocks. Lots of dumb to be found.
561 2018-02-25 19:24:11 When things become intolerable you wake the tolerant to intolerance. I loved recreational shooting but I'm happy to never shoot again of we can get militarized semi automatic rifles, large capacity magazines and belt drives and bump stocks off the market.
562 2018-02-25 19:22:30 Took my cousin and brother to their first tourney and they entered and took stocks  did better than me their first time and knew 1/2 the controls. Now they wanna keep playing. Time to raise a new generation of smashers ?
563 2018-02-25 19:22:30 You really like using that word don't you... Even when it is incorrectly applied.
This isn't about race... His treatment of guns was all about race.
This is about type of rifle, age of most mass shooters in schools and bump stocks. The rest of the guns are not issue for most.
564 2018-02-25 19:21:50 And it is equally sinister to assume that those who seek sensible gun control are out to repress individuals.There is middle ground,esp around semi-automatic,bump stocks and excessive no. guns per head.For years,many have asked but not heard a reason why anyone needs an AR-15
565 2018-02-25 19:21:20 @FLGovScott - FL govt CAN
...ban bump stocks
...harden schools
.
FL govt CANNOT
...set age to buy guns
...deny person diagnosed w/

...deny person who didn't pass

.
@POTUS

Sounds like FL would ratify

566 2018-02-25 19:20:52 Are there such things as bump-stocks for weapons that are not semi-automatic?
567 2018-02-25 19:20:35 very nice 
568 2018-02-25 19:19:28 It's an operating business and those have overhead costs, period. He's talking about funds of funds that invest in stocks, which themselves have overhead costs.

Que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments

570 2018-02-25 19:18:47 The ATF evaluated it and found that ccording to law bump stocks couldn’t be regulated as a firearm. To surpass this Obama would have to either make an executive order or pass a new law, he didn’t, no one else did, and that is the reason you can criticize, not the approval itself
571 2018-02-25 19:18:32 I’ll agree with banning bump stocks - approved under Obama.
572 2018-02-25 19:17:49 3 of those 5 million people are rational adults who agree with background checks and waiting periods not to mention the banning of assult weapons and bump stocks. the other 2 million are just waiting to get on the #banwagon
573 2018-02-25 19:17:23 'Ok google. Do bump stocks kill people or do guns kill people?'
574 2018-02-25 19:15:24 Bump stocks hit market in 2010. Nothing was done by obama admin to stop them.   Let’s do the right thing and get those off the market, ngd.
575 2018-02-25 19:15:11 Actually, the @NRA supported the banning of bump stocks.

Historically, five days after a mass shooting, gun stock prices go up 2%. And the threat of regulation keeps them up, as owners panic and stockpile weapons.

592 2018-02-25 19:10:51 Omg, this is such a lie!! NRA opposed banning bump stocks, Oct 2017; opposes new age limits, Feb 21, 2018; universal background checks, 2015; want states with tougher gun laws to accept reciprocity of states with weaker gun laws, 2/2/18;

Meanwhile, bigger news is whether there's movement to pass SB 5444 or a version of it. To paraphrase one of your colleagues, if you don't know that you should. #waleg #opengov
595 2018-02-25 19:09:57 @AnnCoulter I mention voter ID I am told it’s in the constitution and it won’t be changed. 2nd Amendment is in there and the left is very eager to change.Why is one OK and not the other?I’ll make a deal, I’ll give them bump stocks if they give me national voter ID.
596 2018-02-25 19:09:39 I support the GOA @OhioGunOwners No compromise. @NRA Supported the 1990 Gun Free Zone Act. Why we are in this shape now. Wrote foundation bill for the Unconstitutional NICS. And now, want to ban bump stocks and other devices. They do not how to defend the 2nd Amendment.
597 2018-02-25 19:09:11 I’m a CHCL holder & gun owner. I support common sense gun laws, stronger background checks, ban of bump stocks & other modifications, & banning the sale of weapons of war to the public. The NRA & GOA does NOT speak for me.
598 2018-02-25 19:08:45 In the nineteenth century, it was called "plain cooking" which simply meant no messing around with stocks and fonds.  No hope of reviving that name though.
599 2018-02-25 19:08:04 I mentioned cases where it occurs.
In the present situation leadership of NRA has exhibited an inflexibility in the area of age limits, gun types and bump stocks that has irritated people big time so they boycott. They do not want to go after your guns. Nor do they blame you for
600 2018-02-25 19:07:42 Bump stocks have nothing to do with school shootings.

What % of homicides in the last 10 years have been committed with bump stocks?

You think you're gonna stop the left there?
601 2018-02-25 19:07:37 I love it when traders say “I like to be in charge of handling/investing my own money” yet they spread the word to stay away from cryptos.

602 2018-02-25 19:07:15 After every arsenal defeat If arsenalfantv had stocks, they would be sooo high now they would be competing with Bitcoin 
603 2018-02-25 19:07:08 We have known this. NRA doesn't permit them to vote. They tightly control that. NRA isn't a rifleman's org, its a gun manufacturing org.
Bump stocks aren't made by them btw and aren't permitted on gun ranges.
"The sniper" died on a gun range. No better qualified human w/ guns.
604 2018-02-25 19:06:43 Don’t bother to vote on removing assault weapons from sale, bumper stocks, increasing age to purchase weapon, put back ban on sale to mentally disabled, etc.  DEFUNDING A BLUE STATEMUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN CHILDREN LIVES!
605 2018-02-25 19:06:26 It was a failure. In fact the AR-15 became one of the most popular rifles in America because of the assault weapons ban. Legislators had no idea how to define “assault weapon”. They argued over scary looking grips, stocks and accessories without regard to tactical advantage.

607 2018-02-25 19:05:23 If you had supported a ban on AR-15s, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines this would be a moot point.
608 2018-02-25 19:05:17 Tony, i have never said to take all guns.
only ban bump stocks, clips over six shots and assault weapon manufacture ban.
And a rebuy of banned items to get them off the street.
i am going to start pacing my responses,  you are no challenge and i do not want to get lazy in replies
609 2018-02-25 19:05:06 You want the NRA & GOP to support common sense gun control? Threaten to start a campaign to arm ALL female & minority citizens with assault weapons, bump stocks,  large magazine clips and licenses to carry them concealed. BOTH will do an about face on a dime!
610 2018-02-25 19:03:26 I suggest we tank their stocks.
611 2018-02-25 19:02:51 Has not been pass yet. But Trump wants that and to band bump stocks. NRA wants to band bump stock. Congress has to pass the laws.
612 2018-02-25 19:02:45 Doing research on how to identify supply/demand zones for stocks.  Seems to me that the most valid starting point to calculate a demand/supply zone is with candle that is 50% or less the size of the next candle up/down. Not same size. @CHUPPY11301 @EcoQuantIntel @TheRealDaybyDay
613 2018-02-25 19:02:17 Dana Loesch is like a machine in deflecting any responsibility by the NRA.  She has no empathy and no soul.  Raising the age to buy AR 14s  and banning bump stocks need to happen. She just talks around that, blaming everyone else....not buying her BS!
614 2018-02-25 19:01:25 Don't deviate. Mention ur historical updated data of past six months at least to believe ur  tall claims of lakhs of rupees return.  Come out clean or stop posting new stocks updates mindlessly which no can even follow even hypothetically forget about real investment.
615 2018-02-25 19:01:20 Shhh. Don't bother me. I'm being culturally introspective.

Okay, I'm done. That introspection has led me to conclude that our culture needs to ban ARs & high capacity magazines. And bump stocks of course.
616 2018-02-25 18:58:09 You haven't delivered on anything yet... 
Stocks are high up but the dollar is crashing. A recession is imminent, triggered by when they find out what a fraud your policies were/are.
617 2018-02-25 18:57:56 I think a meta that should be experimented with is understanding if you have a lead (and especially if you’re at a decently high percent) you should be quick to trade stocks with a suicide dair given the opportunity.  Goes with falco as well.
618 2018-02-25 18:57:50 Afraid I don’t agree. If majority were, indeed, decent people & patriots, they’d be pressuring their organization to support appropriate gun controls-banning assault weapons, lg clip ammo & bump stocks, universal background checks, raise purchase age to 21. Deafening silence...
619 2018-02-25 18:57:09 I think I know what they’re trying to do with the NRA here. Have their stocks drop so Trumps big baller friends could buy in at its lowest and ride the up wave.
620 2018-02-25 18:56:43 On top of that, the NRA supports several types of increased gun control, including mandatory reporting from states and banning bump stocks.
621 2018-02-25 18:55:53 3rd January 2018 was one such day when stocks like Graphite, Rain Industries , Philips Carbon were up by 10% or more.Other stocks in the portfolio also went up by 5% or more. Hopefully such days come few more times this year. Cheers to investing !

I don't believe it will be civil war, but there are some heavily armed nuts out there who can do a lot of damage with AR-15s & bump stocks.

626 2018-02-25 18:53:32 Thing is: something has to be done about the shootings and I for one would be happy if it's just gun safes, banning bump stocks and more thorough BG checks.

I had a discussion yesterday with a guy who literally told me his dad deserved his guns
627 2018-02-25 18:52:53 A starting point:
1) #BanAssaultWeapons 
2) Ban Bump Stocks & similar accessories 
3) Ban clips/mags over 15 shots
4) Buy-Back Program for AR-15 (LE removes & destroys firing pins 1st); paid for w/deal with metal recyclers-extra tax on gun sales.
5) 30-Day Waiting Period...
628 2018-02-25 18:52:04 People accuse cryptocurrencies on being fueled by speculation. Well, snapchat just lost 1.3 billion usd in market valuation in a single day because of a tweet from someone called Kylie Jenner! Yes a single tweet! Everything is valued mostly on speculation, art, stocks.

#2 - Whatever Jerome Powell says on Tuesday to the House Financial Services Committee and Thursday to the Senate Committee.
630 2018-02-25 18:51:59 Probably. Then hand grips. Then quad rails, then adjustable stocks and single point slings. Then ARs. Then all box fed semi-autos. 

And people like you will provide the Left with cover. It’s gross.

632 2018-02-25 18:50:26 SENSE OVER CENT$! Hypocrites! This IS Choose Life! AT NO AGE should ANYONE OTHER THAN MILITARY/SWAT own AUTOMATIC ASSAULT KILLING MACHINES or BUMP STOCKS! Not demanding NO Guns of NRA; but, LIFE should Trump Rt. To Auto-Assault Weapons! Employ Common Sense!
633 2018-02-25 18:49:33 Absolutely irrational on your part. The NRA and I disagree with you. Bump stocks are a goner.
634 2018-02-25 18:48:20 Lmao, it's trivial to adapt non-bolt action weapons to be close enough to automatic to make no difference. Slide fire stocks, binary/echo triggers, bump stocks, etc. NFA only regulates weapons that are designed to shoot “automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading”
635 2018-02-25 18:48:03 StockChart/RTG I saw that you are starting posting some StockChart. It is a great place for TA's. as Penny stock start to level off, I will be spending my time on the big board/ US and CAD stocks. always something to swing or day trade.
636 2018-02-25 18:47:58 Worst comes to worst:

-Police dept. will follow up closer on online threats.

-FBI takes their tip line seriously.

-Campuses get metal detectors.

-Bump stocks go away. 

The outcome of all this (w/ a high probability) is our kids will get much needed added protection.
637 2018-02-25 18:47:01 I wonder how the stocks are doing in adult diapers these days.
638 2018-02-25 18:46:20 Next stop: Gun manufacturer stocks. Held by many retirement funds and big banks.
639 2018-02-25 18:45:44 SENSE OVER CENT$! Hypocrites! This IS Choose Life! AT NO AGE should ANYONE OTHER THAN MILITARY/SWAT own AUTOMATIC ASSAULT KILLING MACHINES or BUMP STOCKS! Not demanding NO Guns of NRA; but, LIFE should Trump Rt. To Auto-Assault Weapons! Employ Common Sense!
640 2018-02-25 18:45:40 The real answer from Dave Vest.
Regulate bump stocks and trigger cranks but allow competitive shooters free to fix their triggers which would marginally increase rate of fire. Quit trying to ban things that only a timer would detect an increase.
641 2018-02-25 18:45:22 So is claiming its intent covers assault weapons, bump stocks, and large magazines.
642 2018-02-25 18:44:21 Nice try -Walmart laid off thousands and cutting back on hiring.  Stocks plummeted. You can lie better than that!
643 2018-02-25 18:43:17 If semi autos are banned I wouldn’t be upset I just hope that whatever is legal can have adjustable grips and stocks and such. I think that’s why it’s so popular. Along with the fact that it’s military licensing allow any company to make there own version with wide price ranges
644 2018-02-25 18:43:13 Your Right  to own a gun should end if you attack kids with PTSD from being in a mass shooting. Death threats against children? Not only do I think you should be punished, you should be placed in stocks and publicly shamed.
645 2018-02-25 18:43:10 Banning bump stocks to save lives is tacit admission that guns are bad, and that restricting them will save lives.

It won’t help. Don’t do it. Don’t add to the momentum. Don’t accept their premise.
646 2018-02-25 18:43:09 This is a legal machine gun , with bump stocks added. There should be no way a non-soldier could get access to this. Only at target shooting clubs. #BanAssaultWeapons #AR15 #LasVegas

648 2018-02-25 18:42:09 charts show you the relative strength and momentum for a group of stocks. Stocks with strong relative strength and momentum appear in the green Leading quadrant. As relative momentum fades, they typically move into the yellow Weakening quadrant. If relative strength then fades,
649 2018-02-25 18:40:51 Do you feel naked with out being able to defend yourself with a machine gun or grenades?  No?  Then you don’t need bump stocks or AR-15’s. At some point, kids should be allowed to live and not grieve all the time.

653 2018-02-25 18:39:44 The only reason that gun stocks rise is because ppl like u insist on taking them all and it causes more ppl to run out an buy them.  There are now almost 17 million concealed carriers in this country.

659 2018-02-25 18:39:12 I dont want to ban any of that, but I am working for a return of the 94-04 AWB which would limit newly sold magazines to 10 rounds for the handguns you mention and the AR's.

Additionally, the AR's would lose their collapsible stocks and flash hiders.
660 2018-02-25 18:38:49 Or the outlawing of bump stocks. The 1st time I heard of a bump stock was after the Vegas shooting #VegasStrong
661 2018-02-25 18:38:28 Soooo the freedoms you’re worried about are owning bump stocks, guns before 21, and having assault weapons? Amazing that you think you’re so big and bad for going up against the children of this country. This is pathetic. #GunControlNow #boycottnra #StudentsStandUp #msdstrong

663 2018-02-25 18:38:15 So I don’t really see them changing stances on it now.  And I have noticed he has had no support from Republican senators on the idea of banning bump stocks.  So that likely will go nowhere.  So right now, this is all just talk.

NO..let us not forget the Obama Admin approved the sale of "bump stocks"

Good gun control from a lib
666 2018-02-25 18:37:27 What about gun sales being down and gun stocks tanking? Remington bankrupt, Ruger laying off hundreds. And for the record you don’t speak for most gun owners.
667 2018-02-25 18:37:21 2/2. There are many options in 243 6.5 308 7mm-08 260 etc all loved hunting calibers. Adjustable stocks and grips. What’s not to love. The real problem is that bolt action guns with similar features are all $1000+ and I built my gun piece by piece all above board for $550.

672 2018-02-25 18:35:36 Thanks Harald, makes sense!  IMO one of the fastest 10% sell-offs in US history a couple wks ago may have been a watershed moment:  Unlike in 2015 or 2010 (or prior), long end of the UST curve sold off (ie UST ylds rose) as stocks fell sharply...big potential "rule change"
673 2018-02-25 18:34:57 @NRA r the cowards for not doing what is right.Ban the damn Semis & weapons-like & bump stocks.They don’t have a place within a community, they should remain only where they belong in the military.Ppl r NOT saying to BAN ALL WEAPONS, but asking for more restrictions.Get it Right!
674 2018-02-25 18:34:10 So any of those can give you some of the high-level feel of Railroad Tycoon (building/shipping side) in a board game. If you like the individual train management though, crayon rails games like Empire Builder explore that more. Or if you like stocks, Chicago Express or 18xx.

679 2018-02-25 18:32:21 An AR 15 is a military weapon designed to kill people at a high rate of speed. I’m not advocating to take away hunting rifles, I’m saying a ban on Bump stocks and the AR 15 is warranted. An AR 15 should not be in civilian hands
680 2018-02-25 18:32:04 This is what America Wants: Universal background checks. Ban on high capacity magazines, bump stocks, & automatic weapons.

NO ONE WANTS TO BAN ALL GUNS! JUST MILITARY WEAPONS and Bump Stocks
Ban Assault Weapons for purchase by Civilians of any age.
685 2018-02-25 18:28:09 Not opposite everytime, but if they give 10% time of searching tippler/following him, in self analysis of stocks & their motive then success is assured
686 2018-02-25 18:27:57 Yep. Grandfathered in. You get to keep yours. No new ones. No sales commercial or private. High cap mags banned across the board immediately. Possession a felony. Bump stocks same.

Soon enough the old ARs will start to break down, and/or become too expensive to maintain.
687 2018-02-25 18:27:55 Before the facts were out he blamed “bump stocks”.
688 2018-02-25 18:27:34 Yes that was your smoke and mirror trick at the mtg last week, good deflection. What people want is banned military style weapons, ban bump stocks, and, just for you on your concern of ALL semi- autos, ban large capacity mags! No one needs to hunt with a 30 round capacity!
689 2018-02-25 18:27:32 Why is Samuel L Jackson so worried about enhanced background checks and banning bump stocks.
690 2018-02-25 18:27:18 A few people with AR-15, military grade ammo clips, planning and bump stocks can do a lot of damage. Again, I say constant vigilance.
691 2018-02-25 18:26:14 I keep forgetting to buy guns stocks that and I don't really want to support them but you can bet the stock prices going up.

694 2018-02-25 18:25:29 I doubt SWAT teams use the bump stocks. Professionals believe in Aim and fire discipline. Even for the military, there are variations of the M16 and M4 that are not fully automatic - Semi-automatic and 3-Round burst. You burn through ammo on full Auto.
695 2018-02-25 18:25:10 Really, the 2 parts of that which set it apart from any s/a hunting rifle other than cosmetically are the bump stock which is what makes it effectively 'full auto', & the standard 30 rnd interchangeable magazines - ban bump stocks & limit civvies to 5 round mags, AR15 defanged...
696 2018-02-25 18:23:29 We have to face it! The ASSAULT weapons, & the BUMP STOCKS (I can't believe my NEW vocabulary are only the SURFACE of the problem. It is MAINLY gun MANUFACTURERS along with the HELP of the NRA (who actually GRADE ppl according to their preferences. See Dan Rather:
697 2018-02-25 18:23:23 Its the black composite stocks that make them extra killy 
698 2018-02-25 18:22:56 This rate of fire and the resulting carnage is EXACTLY why civilians are not allowed to have fully automatic weapons. But a bump stocks or echo triggers give the shooter the same result, as seen here. Why are THOSE legal when the result is the same?

BTW...I pulled out of all my 401k funds that includes gun stocks...hit them in the wallets as well!
701 2018-02-25 18:21:40 It matters because aside from one pretty universally agreed on thing (bump stocks need to go), I don't see how banning specific weapons is really going to mitigate any sort of attack.
702 2018-02-25 18:20:27 You didn’t have to say it. We know how this works. Rights are eroded bit by bit, like soil under a river. People like you say “oh that little pebble, I don’t need that” until there is nothing left. 

I can’t believe you think bump stocks will appease them...smh.
703 2018-02-25 18:20:08 This is an AR-15 modified with a bump stock. AR-15 is not an assault weapon. I do agree that bump stocks circumvent law and should be banned.
704 2018-02-25 18:20:05 Stephen Paddock used fourteen AR-15s with bump stocks and mags that held between 75-100 rounds.

He killed 58 & wounded another 400+.

Obviously we need to ban all semi-auto ARs, high cap mags, and bump stocks. Only a fucking gun nut would argue with that.

Put all their savings into sea salt stocks. Can't retire.
706 2018-02-25 18:19:43 However, gruesome clubbings may increase. Those things had big wooden stocks mounted at the end of a metal bar. Ouchie.
707 2018-02-25 18:19:32 Yes. Yes they are. By taking a stand against a organization that thinks it can dictate gun legislation. Legislation that would raise the age limits to 21 from 18. The elimination of bump stocks to the general public. That alone will at least help towards preventing tragedies.
708 2018-02-25 18:19:28 For a retail investor new in the market with small money to invest in starting,how many stocks should they have in their portfolio & how can they do market research to know where to invest.
709 2018-02-25 18:18:54 Sounds like...stop with them weasel words. 

Bump stocks are going. They are a weird modification that noone really anticipated, but are unfortunately bloody easy to make and currently a legal grey area. Banning them requires some legal fiddling.
710 2018-02-25 18:18:47 Great idea...but which stocks you are planning to buy..
711 2018-02-25 18:18:05 @JeffBezos 
 Selling all my AMZN stocks and cancelling Prime if you continue to support NRA! Stop airing NRATV.
712 2018-02-25 18:16:56 I mean I assume such a modification is possible; isn’t that part of the popularity of bump stocks? They don’t give you full automatic capabilities but they get you closer - and that’s the legal option.
Melt the goddamn rifles.
713 2018-02-25 18:16:27 I have to go to my Trump cult meeting to check my stocks, my 401K and see if my Trump bonus check arrived yet.
714 2018-02-25 18:14:40 No - we haven't got that far yet. They have made their position clear. The problem is that banning bump stocks is going to rely on changing certain definitions, which needs to be done first.
715 2018-02-25 18:14:32 @POTUS @seanhannity  U dont need 2 cave N on anythng. U SAY U R going 2 keep the 2ndA but U R letting them chip away & take our Defense awy frm us. Whtevr U ban guns, drugs U cud still get thm, ask Holder & Obummer.DR's kill babies @ PP & U ban b stocks, no chnce like babies
716 2018-02-25 18:13:56 Like your Judeo-Christian to-do list. That's a very Old Testament view of the World. Jesus would not approve. But sounds like a great program if you own defense & oil stocks.
717 2018-02-25 18:13:48 Regarding the last item, he does say it is less risky to own stocks IF you buy them at reasonable price.
Buy now when it is so expensive is risky even over 10-20 years.
718 2018-02-25 18:13:41 IT IS THE GOV'T OBLIGATION TO PROTECT CITIZENS AGAINST LETHAL WEAPONS as a military style assault weapons. RE-INSTATE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN OF THE 90s to include high capacity magazines, bump stocks, min. age to buy, several days to wait, close the gun show loophole.
719 2018-02-25 18:13:29 EVERYONE should go through background checks and NO ASSAULT rifles allowed. Bump stocks banned. Metal detectors everywhere until the insanity and carnage ends
720 2018-02-25 18:12:50 Dans le sujet du Devoir que @freakonometrics a trouvé, des problèmes juridiques sont soulevés. Et des problèmes financiers aussi, conséquence des précédents.
Pas comparable à la France, où la société d'État vend depuis plusieurs années ses stocks.
721 2018-02-25 18:12:47 Can you show me an example of the NRA supporting a bill in Congress to regulate bump stocks?
722 2018-02-25 18:12:21 I am in total support of banning assault rifles,high capacity mags,bump stocks,raising age limits,more invasive background and mental checks,etc.  People still have a right to protect thier family though and let's not forget why Hitler disarmed his citizens
723 2018-02-25 18:12:18 Thank you @GaelTarleton and @RepNoelFrame for your support of both the ban on bump stocks and the voluntary waivers for suicide prevention. Both are common sense laws that will help prevent gun violence and suicide in our state. We're with you. @MomsDemand #ExpectUs #enough
724 2018-02-25 18:11:14 @realDonaldTrump United, Delta want their stocks to tank.  #Qanon #Maga #CNNSOTU #UnitedAirlines #DeltaAirlines
725 2018-02-25 18:10:53 You can't pay bills day trading penny stocks with any kind of consistency that is for sure. It takes such a very small amount of money to move this garbage even if you find something you think works it will be blown out very quickly. This garbage is called garbage for a reason.
726 2018-02-25 18:10:53 Is it? The NRA have straight up said they are against bump stocks. I don't see how you can infer anything here.
727 2018-02-25 18:10:50 Because banning bump stocks and and raising the minimum semi-auto purchase age is NOT absolutely the least the @NRA can do...
728 2018-02-25 18:10:16 Gun solution I’d be down for: 
Ban bump stocks and similar accessories
You can buy handguns, shotguns, and guns primarily for hunting at age 18
Semi auto assault rifles at age 21
Comprehensive background checks on all purchases
Domestic abuse convictions disqualify
729 2018-02-25 18:10:01 Of course it is.  That is why people invested all their money in Madoff's fund instead of good stocks.  And why people gave their money to Charles Ponzi, James Houston, Jordan Belfort, Sergei Mavrodi, Mark Karpelès, Danny Brewster, Josh Garza, ...
730 2018-02-25 18:09:45 @WriterAwareness
731 2018-02-25 18:08:59 Do you have mutual funds that hold gun company stocks that could be moved elsewhere?
732 2018-02-25 18:08:43 Universal, no exception background checks. Ban on bump stocks and large clips. Age limits. Money for mental health and family services. So many things that aren't geared to sell more guns for your NRA buddies.
733 2018-02-25 18:08:39 SENSE OVER CENT$! Hypocrites! This IS Choose Life! AT NO AGE should ANYONE OTHER THAN MILITARY/SWAT own AUTOMATIC ASSAULT KILLING MACHINES or BUMP STOCKS! Not demanding NO Guns of NRA; but, LIFE should Trump Rt. To Auto-Assault Weapons! Employ Common Sense!
734 2018-02-25 18:08:32 This woman is a horrible person. She promotes the NRA and their ajenda to put as many military weapons on the market so more people can die.  She said the left loves American's die.  She is sick. Take the bump stocks & machine guns off the market.
735 2018-02-25 18:07:59 Every time an ice dancer does a twizzle, Twizzlers’ stocks go up. #FakeOlympicsFacts
736 2018-02-25 18:07:40 We absolutely must have now new gun safety laws as requested by Florida high school students banning assault weapons, bump stocks banning mentally ill from buying guns, increase age to 21 for gun purchases
737 2018-02-25 18:07:30 Bless up
738 2018-02-25 18:07:18 I didn't mean to imply you were if I did. I'm for better controls in place too. While I disagree with banning AR-15's, just based on how few they kill, I see know need for loophole bump stocks. I've fired them and honestly it was the least safe I've ever felt firing a gun.
739 2018-02-25 18:06:05 I don’t think anyone should have one of *those* guns or the very least make bump stocks illegal and make the clips or whatever smaller so there is less ability to kill so many people so fast.
740 2018-02-25 18:05:55 Fingerprint or face recognition trigger locks, GPS manufactured into gun stocks with public places having detectors if they come within 250 ft . We have the tech and geeks smarter than me can come up with safe solutions. NRA blocking sane discussion with their propaganda campaign
741 2018-02-25 18:05:47 Definitely going to be an epic bull vs bear battle this week in US stocks...
742 2018-02-25 18:05:42 Yes, the new boss is different from the old boss. Yes Fed support of the stock market may disappear. Powell sworn in Feb 5 & stocks sold off sharply. He made no mention of sell-off or of stocks. No mention of markets, but rate normalization, balance sheet shrinkage & regulations.
743 2018-02-25 18:05:40 Good question. The short answer is yes, we did- and the difference in soil C stocks wasn't statistically significant 2012-2016. BUT- unfortunately the grazing exclosure had been grazed once since 2012, so we couldn't include it as a control.
744 2018-02-25 18:04:22 How the fuck Bump Stocks are not illegal is beyond me
745 2018-02-25 18:03:43 Exchanges should also ban purchase of stocks with soaring price? Where is the "free market" here?
746 2018-02-25 18:03:40 This is all off topic.   The point is NEVER AGAIN.  Complete background checks, 28 day waiting period, NO bump stocks and no assault weapons are all reasonable actions that need to be taken.  If you have a mental illness or a restraining order your guns are taken away.
747 2018-02-25 18:03:31 Uh, military grade weapons (as in fully auto) are already banned from civilian use. 

AR-15 style weapons are generic sporting rifles and not the same as a real AR-15, which has selective fire capability and therefore do not need bump stocks. Even with mods they're not the same.
748 2018-02-25 18:03:30 Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and large capacity magazines. Have a state wide gun buy back program. For starters...
749 2018-02-25 18:02:59 Just FYI I'm not a "gun grabber". I don't want anyone's guns. I want better controls in place. I want AR-15s off the market and bump stocks. Peace.
750 2018-02-25 18:02:41 Better information sharing - you’re asking govt to be competent. Impossible.

Domestic violence...this exists. Pay attention.

Bump stocks - have been linked to the deaths of fewer people than lightning in the last decade. Their existence is irrelevant.
751 2018-02-25 18:01:37 Genre y'a des stocks de bouffe pour 67 personnes dans une banque ?
752 2018-02-25 18:01:19 When they find bullets used were purchased by NSA in 2013, then what?  Who did that?  Who would do that?  Bump stocks found in a Mosque?????
753 2018-02-25 18:01:12 Right!
This is why our position should be to #RepealThe2nd and then work backward from there to maybe get to stricter gun control. 
Start with “let’s maybe regulate bump stocks” & we wind up with nothing (but more dead kids)
754 2018-02-25 18:00:56 Ils ont des stocks !
755 2018-02-25 18:00:49 Limited stocks will be available around April-June 2018.

757 2018-02-25 17:59:55 You can’t argue with Australia’s gun control. Rifles & pistols? Keep them. Automatic weapons & bump stocks should be controlled, limited as methadone is for addicted shooters who need their target practice! It won’t fix knife & vehicle wielding angry zealots but it’s a start!
758 2018-02-25 17:59:32 The facts are that if civilians with rifles went up against the US military they would all die. Facts. Ur AR-15s won’t save u from the big bad government. They’ll use bombs, tanks, jets, drones, chemical weapons, etc. you think you can take them on with semi-autos n bump stocks?
759 2018-02-25 17:59:03 What this highlights are 2 points;
1. How tight global production to demand really is, in that such a small drop in prod can cause such a large drop in stocks
2. How little spare capacity their truly is, and that shale prod is not a flood, but a trickle, into rising demand.
760 2018-02-25 17:58:09 Hi folks,the Coffe House in Skipton stocks Gerhard's pretzels again - Salt and Sugar & Cinnamon.
761 2018-02-25 17:57:49 Movement against gun violence needs to pursue:
-Total ban on assault weapons PLUS 
-No large ammo clips PLUS 
-No bump stocks PLUS 
-Waiting period AND 
-Tougher background checks.   
Offers just to ban bump stocks and stiffen background checks is not enough!  Don’t settle!
762 2018-02-25 17:57:43 The @NRA doesn't even listen to its members, who support background checks & bans on bump stocks, assault weapons.
763 2018-02-25 17:56:31 It would be too big of a job to get rid of all the guns but having some strict laws on owning them is a start. Also banning stupid shit like bump stocks.
764 2018-02-25 17:55:27 Investors Buying Stocks With Debt Leaves Markets Vulnerable...
765 2018-02-25 17:55:21 Not ARs or Bump Stocks it all about $$$$ To the NRA The Right to bear arms doesn’t include Hand-grenades ARs Gas grenades etc those belong in the Trained hands of our Above Reproach Military NOT ON THE STREES OF USA Responsible Gunowners know n most all favor stiffer BGC Rs N Ds
766 2018-02-25 17:54:13 It was just an idea that some teachers trained and certified to handle guns are in favor of.  It isn’t gospel. He also supports raising the age to legally obtain firearms to 21 and ban bump stocks. Is that ridiculous too?
767 2018-02-25 17:54:04 Not so. Extensive background checks are good. 21 also good. We must outlaw bump stocks, assault weapons being sold to the public. Guns don’t kill. Bad people do. A crook can always get a gun. Just make it harder for all to buy a gun.
768 2018-02-25 17:53:19 Strawman nonsense. People aren't calling for a ban on all semi-automatic weapons. We're calling for a ban on semi-automatic rifles. ARs. AKs. Bushmasters. etc etc.

Semi-auto handguns don't support bump stocks & 30 round magazines like assault weapons do.

769 2018-02-25 17:53:13 Gun sales went during Obama time and stocks on gun sales went up so he helped due to hysteria from conservatives
770 2018-02-25 17:52:41 #askwarren Years ago the Buffett indicator worked as the market cap of US stocks was mostly based on US sales and earnings. Now it has been augmented by sales and earnings from abroad. 
 Is it still useful? What ratios would indicate a cheap, a fair and an expensive valuation.
771 2018-02-25 17:52:08 I wasn’t assuming, the comments are almost all criticism. A lot of people hear “gun” and automatically think “bad”. I was just pointing out that this girl shouldn’t be attacked. I agree that bump stocks and high capacity magazines need reform.

774 2018-02-25 17:51:51 If you don’t like Trump, then doesn’t this also mean that you are going to give back the extra money you get from tax breaks?  Are you gonna give back profits on your 401k, stocks and other investments?  It’s because of his administration that you are enjoying these things!
775 2018-02-25 17:51:28 Tom, Love At Issue. Feel it most unbiased media in TC. Keeps me up on MN Politics. Today Sarah Walker said Rep. Paulsen supported Bump stocks. Is that true? I am shocked he would favor them. I questioned other things she has said as new guest. Keep up good work, Happy Birthday.
776 2018-02-25 17:51:26 Sad thing is it won’t even happen.  It’s just a political gesture for media coverage.  Bump stocks will remain legal.
777 2018-02-25 17:51:01 1) No, the shooter did not have a bump stock.
2) The @NRA is not in support of bump-stocks

788 2018-02-25 17:48:07 All of the retirees that I know are doing the opposite with stocks.  They are buying every dip with the hope that stocks keep rising to new highs, as that is the only way they can fund their lifestyle.  Scary stuff.
789 2018-02-25 17:48:01 Understood. But, does the average gun owner need bump stocks, rapid fire weapons to protect themselves from the government?
790 2018-02-25 17:47:33 The real problem with Guns, is the lack of Gun education. Yes this gun has the same capibilities as the AR-15. And all this talk about banning Bump Stocks, when you can create the same effect with a simple Rubber Band. WAKE THE FU@K UP LIBS!!

796 2018-02-25 17:41:58 A safe and sound solution, Implement the following:
1.  Change the legal age to 21 to purchase any type of firearm                    2. Ban Bump Stocks 
3. 7 day waiting period 
4. Expanded NIC/NAC cheeks                  5. Institute Mandatory firearm use and safety classes
797 2018-02-25 17:41:56 That's the LIE they're trying to tell you no one wants to take away anybody's guns we want to not sell bump stocks close the loophole at gun shows and not let mentally ill people buy guns

805 2018-02-25 17:40:35 This is not the solution. That's not a teachers job. The NRA, Capitol Hill and the gun lobby created this situation and need to take accoutanbility for it. Enact reasonable gun control, fix background check system and ban bump stocks.  And stop taking money from the NRA.
806 2018-02-25 17:40:34 Thanks. NY & NJ are also on the list of states that invest pensions in gun stocks.

808 2018-02-25 17:39:36 #stocks  Deduct the manager's fees, and the BS in trying to get your dollar, and you'd probably do no better than a 5.5% return from most actively managed mutual funds. Don't reward the broker. Reward yourself with index funds or selecting your own cash flowing stocks.
809 2018-02-25 17:39:28 If your predictions are also what you hope happens, then that is called wishful thinking.

822 2018-02-25 17:33:36 Maybe you missed the part about banning bump stocks. Or are anti gun folks saying they’re not a big deal all of a sudden now that Trump is banning them? These new gun proposals would be the most significant in decades but as we know, it’s all or nothing with ignorant left.

824 2018-02-25 17:32:41 I’ve not seen anyone suggest getting rid of all guns in the US is possible, but making large capacity magazines and bump stocks illegal would greatly reduce mass shootings.

827 2018-02-25 17:31:39 They also announced they do not support raising the age limit to buy a gun. Aaaannnddd I’m pretty sure they do not support banning bump stocks either. Not to mention @DonaldJTrumpJr pushing the “silencer” agenda. This admin will help cause more school shootings.

832 2018-02-25 17:30:04 I called it an Assault Rifle (I don't know anything bout guns) point i was trying to make was why is it being used in all mass shootings? Get it off street.  NOW did they have BUMP stocks? If so does that make it an Assault Rifle?
833 2018-02-25 17:29:42 It's just clear to me that the NRA - who oppose virtually any gun control of any sort - bump stocks are still available, despite Vegas - want people to think that all gun control advocates want to repeal the Second Amendment, because that way maintains the status quo,

838 2018-02-25 17:26:42 Whose asking for a gun ban? Of course no one is for mass shootings . We are for banning all military style guns designed to kill dozens quickly . That includes bump stocks etc

841 2018-02-25 17:24:29 Why don’t Dana and the NRA want you to see that? The NRA wants the BATF to regulate bump-stocks like machine guns. That’s how they were originally treated.
842 2018-02-25 17:23:45 Bump stocks were illegal. Obama made them legal again.
843 2018-02-25 17:23:03 Do some research.  The NRA supports background checks and additional regulations on bump stocks - among other things.

845 2018-02-25 17:21:16 Imposing age limits to buy assault rifles & banning bump stocks is not disarming citizens. And no one is talking about revoking the 2A. And propaganda that attempts to undermine common sense approaches to save Americans from mass executions is an anachronism.
846 2018-02-25 17:20:24 I am all for tightening up the background checks, getting rid of bump stocks as well as longer waiting times.  Can we just not pretend people are really concerned about the precious lives being lost from guns when almost a 1mil babies are aborted each year compared to roughly 15k

867 2018-02-25 17:08:54 Most NRA members are sane, law-abiding citizens who do not have or want military style weapons, bump stocks, & high capacity clips. They have hunting rifles & pistols. OK. But if they interpret the 2nd Amend to allow others to own AR-15s, etc., they are as guilty as Nikolas Cruz.

871 2018-02-25 17:07:21 @NRA refuses to do ANYTHING about modification to existing rifles  i.e. Bump stocks
872 2018-02-25 17:06:50 The one thing they are not is educated on it. That’s proven every time they mutter the words assault weapons, weapons of war, bump stocks. List goes on.
873 2018-02-25 17:06:49 Hmm... 5 million vs 250 million voters most of whom now are looking at NRA as if it is a worm because it does not want to raise age for access or even get rid of bump stocks. Inflexibility doesn't help NRA nor does its thought that more guns make things better. It played poorly.
874 2018-02-25 17:06:48 Nonetheless, it was still the Obama Admin who approved the sale of bump stocks. (Thanks Obama)

891 2018-02-25 16:56:56 @davidhogg111 Don't let Trump pull the wool over your eyes. He's ( Trump ) trying to ban the bump stocks. Bump stocks do not kill. It's the weapon that kills. Without the weapon the bump stocks are useless. What is wrong with this picture? It helps, but they have to rid the guns.

895 2018-02-25 16:54:55 Ok ok- but at the LEAST, very LEAST, can we raise the age to 21, and BAN BUMP STOCKS???
896 2018-02-25 16:54:20 Really?  he's for 21 age, far more stringent background checks,  5 day wait period. eliminate bump stocks and restrictions on magazine capacity.  The definition of reasonable gun control!

898 2018-02-25 16:53:11 Leave the bump stocks alone! They do not violate the Firearms Act. GO AFTER THE CRIMINALS!!!!! Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Gun violence can be reduced by eliminating "gun free" zones as well!!!!
899 2018-02-25 16:52:56 I think Las Vegas had the most victims. 58 people were killed and over 800 more were injured - with AR-15's with bump stocks.
900 2018-02-25 16:52:36 President Obama did nothing to prevent school shooting and the Democrats want to ban guns. This is the truth. Oh! President Obama signed into law authorizing Bump Stocks.
901 2018-02-25 16:51:54 Things I generally don’t like but this news cycle is making me defend:

Bump stocks
@NRA
@jaketapper 

I’m afraid this list will grow
902 2018-02-25 16:50:20 They require a Federal firearms license.  We should eliminate bump stocks immediately.
903 2018-02-25 16:48:56 Do you even know what “bump stocks” are, or are you just throwing around terms you hear on the Agenda Left Media?
904 2018-02-25 16:48:38 So long Delta! Maybe you should just keep your mouth shut and concentrate on flying airplanes, which seems to be a challenge for you folks already. I see layoffs and stocks dropping in your future! Snowflakes never win, they just melt away.
905 2018-02-25 16:47:57 One would think that his desire to kick Congress in the rear for gun law improvements would help. Raising the age for purchase, outlawing bump stocks, etc.
906 2018-02-25 16:47:47 Bump stocks? Seriously? How many bump stocks contribute to the incredibly low number of murders using rifles? Another pretend change to make the mob happy. Stomp that liberty in the name of safety that won't make anyone safer. SMH
907 2018-02-25 16:47:35 @DLoesch you're the kind of mother I wouldn't want an @NRA #spokesperson defending the the indefensible, the sale of killing machines like the # bump-stocks gun accessories used in the #LasVegasShooting by an adult and the #AR15 used in the #ParklandShooting.  #BanAssaultWeapons
908 2018-02-25 16:47:31 The man in the backseat mention bump stocks and said how in accurate the rifles behave while shooting. Who needs accuracy while shooting into a crowd of thousands of people you only need speed to kill 58! Ban the bump stock!
909 2018-02-25 16:47:28 And that is why Dana the vampire threw LEO'S under the bus? And that is why they will not support raising age to 21? And that is why they support gun stocks? Hmmmmm.
910 2018-02-25 16:46:00 I’d like to ban assault rifles and bump stocks because no one really needs those for recreational purposes, so that if anyone did get through security they’d at least be less likely to have something capable of what Cruz did.
911 2018-02-25 16:45:26 Trading is hard. I’ve put in my time, made all of the mistakes, I was the terd buying high and selling low.  Now I’ve turned the corner these last few years.  10 years of watching stocks and trading and in my third profitable year consecutive.   Let’s make 2018 the best year yet!
912 2018-02-25 16:45:06 Bump stocks, trigger cranks, large capacity magazines are not needed for hunting nor for personal protection. If you need a 30 shot capacity magazine or larger to bring down an attacker you better get firearms training.
913 2018-02-25 16:45:04 I don’t either. I am fine with getting rid of bump stocks, tougher background checks, and mandatory safety training. But will anyone propose such legislation without sneaking in Howard Metzenbaum-style bans on hunting rifles? Sadly, I’ve seen this movie before.

915 2018-02-25 16:44:48 Following up on previous tweet: Hunting "culture" is not the problem. Don't blame hunters for mental health issues/lack of response/bump stocks and more. Enough blame for all involved. Do comprehensive study of school shootings from response to gun dealers.
916 2018-02-25 16:44:38 Yes it IS a right to bear arms. However, show me ANYWHERE in the Constitution that you have a right to bump stocks, high capacity magazines, assault rifles or the absence of reasonable background checks.
917 2018-02-25 16:44:31 So does it mean the president can ban bump stock anytime he wants? Cool. @realDonaldTrump ban bump stocks now or blood is in your hands. #BoycottNRA
918 2018-02-25 16:43:06 If Dana Loesch purports to "see her kids in every child" why is she missing the fact that the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooter was also a student? She called him "a ____ man". Ban AR-47's & fix the automatic accessory laws regarding bump stocks. #AMJoy
919 2018-02-25 16:42:27 yes, i know all about bump stocks.  no problem banning those either.  lets say all scary looking guns are banned from sale today?   are we really safer tomorrow without other things being done?  nope.

930 2018-02-25 16:38:40 Why no mention of bump stocks? These can get semi autos pretty close to 10 a second, as seen in Vegas.

932 2018-02-25 16:37:01 ...only rifles with bump-stocks from now on
933 2018-02-25 16:36:40 I can hear you on some things. I don’t have a problem with  bump stocks for example being banned. I don’t think we need a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Those are the most common rifle in America. All it means is one trigger squeeze shoots one bullet.

936 2018-02-25 16:35:37 the general population doesn't need automatic weapons to protect themselves, so they don't need bump stocks to do it either.  Limit their access to the same system that currently governs access to automatic weapons. ?Or do you wish everyone to be able to purchase automatic AK-47s
937 2018-02-25 16:34:32 @realDonaldTrump Prevention is better than dealing with an active shooting. Ban Assault weapons, Bump Stocks, Large magazines, Universal data base, Longer wait period to buy a gun, Close gun shows, Better mental health care.

940 2018-02-25 16:34:03 So let me get this straight there are people defending the armed deputies who did not go in to stop the armed shooter in parkland from actually committing the atrocity he did but is so clear he wants to push for removing the AR-15 and bump stocks from people’s homes...wack
941 2018-02-25 16:32:46 If he suggests doing what the left says it wanted (ban bump stocks and raise the age) and they attack him for it, why bother trying to work with them then?

944 2018-02-25 16:31:56 @ubnt Hi guys! What are the plans, roadmap for the Ubiquiti UniFi VoIP phones? I am planning on ordering one (UVP). But stocks are really low/none available in The Netherlands, Germany. Thanks!
945 2018-02-25 16:31:49 End of the sale of bump stocks? There are other ways to bump fire a semi automatic rifle, you don't have to have a special stock to do it! But just like all lawmakers they have no idea what goes on in the real world! Congratulations you're now a politician!
946 2018-02-25 16:31:39 But realistically, @SRuhle, would he gain support? Even when he suggested banning bump stocks like the left wanted, he got attacked by the same people who claimed to want that. He will never will bi-partisan support until people are willing to put their hate for him aside.
947 2018-02-25 16:31:26 The stocks you seem to buy go up. Haven't cone across a tweet of a stock you bought that went down subsequently...hmm how do you time it so well Reb? What's the secret?

950 2018-02-25 16:29:58 Jerry, since you are obviously an expert, can you tell me if the top two weapons in your pic can be modified with bump stocks? If so,  what is the revised rate of fire on those as opposed to the AR-15?
951 2018-02-25 16:29:35 there were plenty of CPAC attendees who want 21yr, bump stocks, background checks ..even there he isn't 100
952 2018-02-25 16:28:24 DO NOT INFRINGE ON MY 2ND AMENDMENT RIGHTS!!!! Bump stocks are legal and, do not violate the Firearms Act. They DO NOT MAKE A SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIREARM AN AUTOMATIC!!! GO AFTER THE CRIMINALS AND YOUR GUN VIOLENCE WILL BE REDUCED!!!
953 2018-02-25 16:28:17 If the NRA is so righteous why aren’t they backing the ban of assault weapons and bump stocks? That’s not taking away the 2A!! They’re not righteous they’re greedy evil. Period. They twist truth to breed fear & anger. That’s evil & greed spkg.
954 2018-02-25 16:28:15 Lls real live  , good shii tho stay on it , I normally try to mess wit lower priced stocks and penny stocks from wat I've seen they have the most chances of big gains quickly
955 2018-02-25 16:28:08 The quickest way to get bump stocks and AR-15s banned is to let the @GOP see photos of black men armed with them.

956 2018-02-25 16:28:01 Doing great! Stocks are up, savings account is STACKED! I owned my car and can afford to replace it with cash. See, I learned a long time ago to not become dependent on a job or businesses so that I could walk away if they tried to screw me.
957 2018-02-25 16:27:47 the point of current automatic weapons laws is to extremely limit access to weapons with high rates of fire.  Bump stocks are an attempt to circumvent the intent of those laws.  Or do you think you need automatic weapon rates of fire in personal defense situations?
958 2018-02-25 16:27:32 The light weight and ergonomic design usually makes up for the loss of FPS for hunting purposes. Pistol grips make all rifles 'look scary' and will probably be banned for that reason. Same with modular stocks. It is not a function, it is an image.
959 2018-02-25 16:27:18 The ONLY scenario where semi-automatic rifles with high capacity magazines, bump stocks and no background checks (private sale) is useful is for a terrorist trying to kill as many people as possible. That is IT.
960 2018-02-25 16:26:53 SHAME on YOU.   BAN Assault Weapons.  BAN Bump Stocks.  Have Background checks.  Require Basic Training and 2 years of Military or Social Service.  Keep militia duty for everyone from 18 to Social Security Age.
961 2018-02-25 16:26:27 Outlawing bump stocks isn’t a big deal, as creating your own rapid fire without buying a bump stock is simple. YouTube has plenty of How To videos.
962 2018-02-25 16:26:22 We are not anti-gun just anti machine guns, bump stocks, weapons of war. Remember that the 2nd Amendment was passed when people had muskets. The founding fathers probably would had been more specific if they could foretell the future.
963 2018-02-25 16:26:07 My Repub hard line. 21 let’s do it. Armed teachers let’s do it. Metal detectors let’s do it. Bump stocks adios. Gun Violence Restraining Orders do it. Commercial gun sales all with instant background checks and a cleaed up the data base. And keep  the 8M AR’s in law abiding hands
964 2018-02-25 16:26:01 Invest in mutual fund stocks as cash outflow may not necessitate rapid selling by adjusting NAV by the swing price.
965 2018-02-25 16:25:57 Haha. Well I’m sure we own some of the same stocks. I’m wrong too sometimes. But I would cover that Tesla short. Look at the charts. Elon will get money every times he runs out. Just like Netflix. Hope you’re not short that too. $tsla $nflx
966 2018-02-25 16:25:25 Liberals are scared of ALL guns, don't let them pretend otherwise. 

NO ONE, literally NO ONE is advocating for bump stocks so your creating a straw man argument. 

AR's are more for protection than hunting but please go on with your propaganda. 

#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
967 2018-02-25 16:25:24 Well if you remember when bump stocks were first up the NRA agreed and supported the ban. The members that make up the NRA really didn't like that they did that. The NRA also believes in the "slippery slope" and the AR15 to many is where it crosses the line.
968 2018-02-25 16:24:59 @Emma4Change I have an idea, #Trump basically controls the #NRA.  If he doesn't make any attempt at #GunReform, why not #Boycott everything his family owns or invests in? We still #BoycottNRASponsors as well, Stocks will go down, he will give in before the NRA in my opinion
969 2018-02-25 16:24:26 Ben stocks

4 HOURS WORKTIME
971 2018-02-25 16:23:34 No one understands that we live in an economic autocracy.Stocks bonds and real estate will go up in perpetuity because it is all rigged.
972 2018-02-25 16:23:28 Why is there even a conversation about modifications to assault rifles? ESPECIALLY bump stocks - when you can produce the same effect without one in about five minutes of practice.  Semi-auto rapid fire. The convo should be about the part being modified: guns
973 2018-02-25 16:22:39 Just curious. Will you be doing a column on how the Obama admin legalized 'bump stocks' and how he has the blood of the Las Vegas victims on his hands?
974 2018-02-25 16:22:07 Teachers demand your pension funds get out of gun manufacturers stocks!  Follow the Money. FYI AOBC manufacturers the AR 15 used in  Parkland shooting. #ParklandStrong #boycottNRASupporters #Teacher(s)
975 2018-02-25 16:21:41 1. I support mandatory background checks for all gun purchases including gun shows and private purchases 2. The law we had in 94-04 banning specific types of guns should be re-enacted 3. Bump stocks and anything like it should be banned 4. The minimum age s/b 21 for all purchases
976 2018-02-25 16:21:35 Common sense needed. There is no need for high capacity mags, no need for kids w assault weapons, no bump stocks needed, children should learn gun safety, hunt & sport shoot, none of those require offensive weapons w unlimited ammo & high capacity clips. 12 guage is best defense
977 2018-02-25 16:21:19 It will happen if teachers are armed. Who’ll get blamed? The shooter or the teacher who’s a lousy shot? Certainly the school board, the city, the state and the Federal Government. Teachers should teach only. AR-15 and Bump Stocks should be banned from sell to civilians.
978 2018-02-25 16:20:46 @davidhogg111 @FedEx @NRA @UPS @USPS can guarantee that UPS and any other  will suffer sales now. Selling off my UPS stocks
979 2018-02-25 16:20:30 Unlimited asset holdings & unlimited unearned income a main feature of disability. As in able to own a bunch of rental property & stocks. Unfortunately, folks like us will have to win the mega millions lottery to be in any discussion about capping out asset levels.
980 2018-02-25 16:19:25 Law biding members of NRA also agree that AR15s and bump stocks should not be in civilians hands, and guess what if you have one that does not make you a secret militia or a law enforcement officer.
981 2018-02-25 16:19:09 Make that two! My stocks and my paycheck are up! MAGA 
982 2018-02-25 16:18:21 its cartridges+muzzle velocity, clips and bump stocks - limits and exclusions.. the styling is a cultural statement
983 2018-02-25 16:17:56 Consistent criminal and mental health background checks with 5 day wait and ban assault weapons and bump stocks is the right thing to do
984 2018-02-25 16:17:51 The AWB didn't apply to already existing guns. And AR15s were modified slightly by the manufacturer to circumvent the ban. Now we have bum stocks that turn them into machine guns. #SCOTUS said NO to #AR15s extended to #2A. #AssaultWeaponsBanNow #BumpstocksBanNow #mtnews #amjoy
985 2018-02-25 16:15:49 Signed off on non reg. bump stocks- If you have a problem with that take it up with the ATF, Obama admin, or Washington Post.
986 2018-02-25 16:15:49 Sorry, the ATF has final say on any device sold by any FFL as to whether it fits Federal Standards. There are several statutes that would have allowed for restriction of bump stocks. It deals any modifications to an approved for sale firearm.
987 2018-02-25 16:15:07 Bump stocks help elderly farmers handle the recoil on their rifle better when they’re shooting hogs or other pests that are destroying their crops. Just so you know. They weren’t invented to make you kill people faster. Smh. Please don’t let this turn to a slippery slope, sir.
988 2018-02-25 16:14:26 The teachers union needs to divest from gun stocks in their retirement fund.  #BoycottNRA
989 2018-02-25 16:14:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
990 2018-02-25 16:13:43 I better call my broker and dump these stocks fast. Have a feeling they are going to be having some big drops 
991 2018-02-25 16:13:26 Maybe Cliff Carson from the MLC could apologise for having no foresight with regards to otters decimating fish stocks- how much money have MLC spent on building otter holts ?? Absolutely gormless bunch of money wasters.
992 2018-02-25 16:13:03 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
993 2018-02-25 16:12:57 Trump could get an end to bump stocks & better background checks on gun owners all in a year as President while being backed by the NRA.

This is something Obama couldn't accomplish in 8 years even after the Sandy Hook massacre.

Evidence of a true leader.

#StartYourImpossible
994 2018-02-25 16:12:41 The NRA does support regulation of bump stocks.
995 2018-02-25 16:12:38 This reads like a list of stocks to sell asap.
996 2018-02-25 16:12:28 Again Sen. Toomey lacks insight into what these students their parents, grandparents, family and friends are saying: TEACHERS NEED TO TEACH. They don't want to be security. Make changes in background checks, chg the purchase are, ban bump stocks. Do something #never again

How courageous of you to back banning bump stocks.
EVERY high school graduate must register to vote in 2018.
We will only see progress through the election process and strong voter turnout.

How do I find out if my retirement funds include any company stocks in gun manufacturere?
1001 2018-02-25 16:12:01 @WarrenBuffett states in the annual letter he has trouble finding company's worth buying. Does that translate into individuals should stop buying stocks at current prices?
1002 2018-02-25 16:10:40 Ending the sale of bump stocks AS WELL AS semi-automatic weapons would be a good start - but their detention should be made illegal too. What are you waiting for !
1003 2018-02-25 16:10:26 IMHO - stop following or listening to the folks who keep insisting more break down is coming..  don’t go crazy long too -  cut down size and limit o/n positions / exposure #stocks #trading
1004 2018-02-25 16:10:18 Nigga Gator is in an emotional abusive relationship  every time he get sad, snack stocks go up.
1005 2018-02-25 16:09:46 How sick is this !!!!!!  Feb 16, 2018 - Stocks were up Thursday for American Outdoor Brands, the company that makes the AR-15 rifle used in the Florida school shooting that claimed 17 lives.
1006 2018-02-25 16:09:40 Bump stocks are a bandage, the AR-15 with a 100 round fires almost as fast as a bump stock. #AMJoy
1007 2018-02-25 16:09:22 In the wake of the tragedy in Florida, United statement suggests that the members of the NRA, like me, are somehow responsible for this tragedy? 

I will NOT be using United for any travel needs. Furthermore, any funds I own that are holding United Stocks I will be selling.
1008 2018-02-25 16:09:21 Two approaches to investing in crypto + stocks are Day/Swing trading and buy and hold. Most people ae not professional traders so will B&H
1009 2018-02-25 16:09:00 Why does it matter? The NRA explicitly stated its position of not supporting leg that would ban bump stocks and other accesssories intended to increase your rate of fire. I don't care who or what a murderer was afflitiated with. I care about not allowing mass murders to continue
1010 2018-02-25 16:08:37 To be clear, I want an assault weapons ban (again!)now. I want universal background checks. I want no guns for DV offenders and people who have committed a violent crime. I want bump stocks and their ilk banned.
1011 2018-02-25 16:08:28 A thorough background check, which includes incidents that police choose to treat as “de minimus”, no military grade weaponry to anyone aligning with a known threat to democracy, ban large clips, silencers, and bump stocks, raise legal age to 21, locked gun cabinets.
1012 2018-02-25 16:08:14 Banning bump stocks and raising age wasnt' what I suggested now was it, so who cares if T agrees to it? I suggested solutions -- do you even know what I said they were? Do you agree iwth them? Or do you just go in circles & to obvucate what's being said.
1013 2018-02-25 16:08:07 Stricter gun control laws mean little when the law enforcement of this country doesn't enforce them.  The laws ALREADY on the books would have prevented these senseless killings.  As a side note, I support the banning of bumper stocks, civilians should not have automatic weapons.
1014 2018-02-25 16:07:38 Wake up ROFL. America IS great. Let's see. Lowest approval rating EVER. Stocks crashing. Yeah, he's awesome.
1015 2018-02-25 16:07:16 In the wake of the tragedy in Florida, Delta  suggests that the members of the NRA, like me, are somehow responsible for this tragedy?

1017 2018-02-25 16:06:19 Actually there has been conversation about increasing the age of purchase to 21 and banning bump stocks. But what's the point of new regulation? Had the current regulations been properly followed this kid wouldn't have been allowed fire arms.
1018 2018-02-25 16:06:12 Officers don't stand a chance.

AR-15's, AR-556's and all assault weapons should be illegal.

High capacity magazines and bump stocks should be illegal.

1019 2018-02-25 16:06:12 I call for everyone to drop stocks in any company doing business with the @NRA oh acancel your prime til @amazon drops @NRATV
1020 2018-02-25 16:06:03 Every time I hear “bump stocks” I think it refers to all the money gun manufacturers and the NRA make supporting terrorism and the murder of children.
1021 2018-02-25 16:05:40 What’s changed is the ban against them expired.  What’s changed is development & sale of bump stocks.  What’s changed are high capacity magazines. What’s changed are loopholes to background checks.  U & your ilk are #complicit in the ongoing murders of around 30k Americans/yr
1022 2018-02-25 16:05:02 @Archimage Goldman Says Stocks May Plunge 25% If 10-Year Yield Hits 4.5% If the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hits 4.5 percent by year-end, the economy would probably muddle through -- stocks, not so much, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. #BLOOMBERG 2018-02-25 11:05:02
1023 2018-02-25 16:05:00 So you disagree with a leading expert when he says:
“We have to get free of this assumption that fisheries are necessarily an international thing
... they have lots of stocks within their exclusive economic zone and these stocks can be managed solely by the national authorities.”
1024 2018-02-25 16:03:38 Watching Sunday morning pundits who skirt the gun violence issue with all sorts of vague reasons but the right one: BAN ASSAULT RIFKES AND BUMP STOCKS! FOR GIDS SAKE WE THE PEOPKE WANT THIS TO HAPPEN NOW!
1025 2018-02-25 16:03:13 @realDonaldTrump 
Honestly! Teachers have a tough enough job! Even a security guard-who was trained, did not have the balls to go in and help those children! Arming teachers is not the answer! Banning bump stocks, Banning being able to buy assault rifles, that will save children!
1026 2018-02-25 16:01:10 I will be honest I usually buy stocks under .01 I have a few exceptions.  
$JBZY I have never stopped buying and admit did trim on some huge runs trimming some risk.   Now after the last opps here from the blood we saw.  Loaded and locked.  Short term deviation on fear all we saw
1027 2018-02-25 16:01:09 Ah.. Missed that one... Thought you were talking about nifty. Stocks you will not be able to do calendar in India.
1028 2018-02-25 16:00:57 Just Military grade weapons, body piercing bullets and bump stocks
1029 2018-02-25 16:00:48 I will not give up either! BAN the sale of any semi-auto rifle, bump stocks, raise the age to purchase or own a gun to 21 years old and create the national permit-to-purchase (PTP) requiring people to obtain a permit, contingent on a background check.
1030 2018-02-25 16:00:13 Do you get paid to bash on very promising stocks ???
1031 2018-02-25 16:00:08 My state’s Republican leaders are ass backwards. Their list of what they are trying to do is 1) Lower age of buying a gun. 2) Allowing teachers to be armed. 3)Not banning Bump Stocks, Assault rifles. They say that assault riffles are no more dangerous than a deer rifle. WTF
1032 2018-02-25 15:59:57 Apology excepted on your error, we all make them.  As for what safety measure do they need to discuss?  How about they start by supporting the immediate & complete ban of bump-stocks?  How about universal background checks?  Both moves supported by a vast majority of the public.
1033 2018-02-25 15:59:44 Definitely better than present pm
1034 2018-02-25 15:59:34 Obama didnt do enough HAHAHA didnt do anything until 2016 and that was crap. @POTUS want to ban bump stocks raise the age to 21. and all the other stuff we just both agreed on so  what is your problem now... 

peace
1035 2018-02-25 15:59:03 This is the problem the test of us have with the NRA - why would a “gun safety” organization ever allow manufacturers to make bump stocks or provide the parts necessary to make easy modifications to semi-auto weapons to make them more lethal? It’s about power - not safety.
1036 2018-02-25 15:58:50 Actually there are a lot of them that can do similar things. We need to ban semi-automatics. At least the rifles. And definitely bump stocks.
1037 2018-02-25 15:58:47 The smugness with which the NRA, Trump, Republicans and Fox News reject increasing age limits, banning bump stocks and improving background checks is infuriating. Mental health is all they want to talk about with no solutions proposed. Do we jail every troubled 18 year old?
1038 2018-02-25 15:57:35 @Vanguard_Group I invested in Vanguard funds for 35 yrs and I have retirement savings with you. I respectfully request that you liquidate all Vanguard fund holdings of gun manufacturing stocks or bonds. The senseless gun violence must stop. Or I will take my money elsewhere.
1039 2018-02-25 15:57:21 Not a Delta airline fan but it will be interesting to see how there stocks go this week. Didn't know they are a liberal airline.
1040 2018-02-25 15:57:01 I won't retweet it because I own lots of NOK stocks and it would be a clash of interests but I was rather impressed today.
1041 2018-02-25 15:56:37 Call them what you want but the fact that the weapon used killed 17 children in minutes is disgraceful and let’s not mention the killing in Las Vegas because of the impact of bump stocks.. in my  this was mass destruction caused by these weapons
1042 2018-02-25 15:55:36 Even I think that bump stocks should have never been legal in the first place. But imo it wouldn’t have stopped the tragedy in Las Vegas.
1043 2018-02-25 15:55:28 @NRA, no one wants to take away your guns little boys. No assault weapons. Registration. No bump stocks.#bloodonyourhands
1044 2018-02-25 15:54:44 COMPROMISE GOAL: Safety not taking away gun owners rights
Strengthen background checks; 
Outlaw bump stocks;
You must be 21 to get a license for restricted firearms, including AR-15s;
You must take a safety course; 
License to carry should be accepted across state lines.
1045 2018-02-25 15:54:26 Short all their stocks tomorrow morning.
1046 2018-02-25 15:54:05 Could it be based on sentiment AND actions during the correction?

Buyers of stocks are pretty happy  

(anecdotal of course) 
1047 2018-02-25 15:51:50 My point is a national gun registry is a sensible gun reform. How about having to license guns? How about banning gun or devices that make guns automatic. Like bump stocks. If we use cars as an analogy..we have more regulations and laws for drivers and cars.
1048 2018-02-25 15:51:38 Thank you for not caving to the inane calls to sever ties with the NRA. They have long worked to keep guns out of criminal/mentally ill hands with actions such as pressuring lawmakers to fix the NICS (background) system and supporting sensible gun laws like banning bump stocks.
1049 2018-02-25 15:51:29 More than just background checks need to be done, no 18 year old civilian should be able to purchase a semi automatic military assult rifle and bump stocks, mentally stable or not.
1050 2018-02-25 15:50:17 .@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @SenateDems The only pro life bill I want to see this year is a ban on assault riffles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. #NeverAgain #GunContolNow #MSDStrong
1051 2018-02-25 15:48:59 I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not but "foreigners" have owned the biggest % of UK stocks for quite some time.

I have no idea why you think that's a bad idea, I think it's marvellous.
1052 2018-02-25 15:48:23 They have 1 rifle per house .  Everyone serves so every one is trained. No bump stocks large magazines etc.  be truthful to yourself.
1053 2018-02-25 15:48:04 Stupidest Comment of the year!! Uses same ammo as other guns. Uses same mechanics as other guns. Only has different external stocks forearms etc. You guys are trying to leverage gun oppression using this school shooting. No One is fooled
1054 2018-02-25 15:46:40 @NRA Dana Loesch is acting like a caged animal. Why can’t the NRA back making bump stocks illegal? Who needs a automatic rifle in their daily lives short of wartime? Oh maybe to inflict mass casualties. 
1055 2018-02-25 15:46:35 Most of your jobs r good. But u shouldn't punish young ppl & ban guns for them bc of school shootings. Your tweets about NFL & stocks were wrong. NFL has nothing to do with military. U can't control stocks. U shouldn't call Steve a crying dog which shows ppl u r a bad & rude boss
1056 2018-02-25 15:46:15 the NRA makes dough off of the sale guns. taking away bump stocks or any item that turns a gun in to a machine gun does not violate the u.s. constitution. keep your handguns, no one is asking for those.
1057 2018-02-25 15:46:03 We’ve conceded to two laughing stocks
1058 2018-02-25 15:45:44 Yes! Also, there are existing laws that some lawmakers try to amend or expand (like bump stocks) and Republicans are blocking them. Speaker Ryan won't even let things get to the house floor. Go for the existing laws too and beef them Up!  Follow @SenFeinstein #NeverAgain
1059 2018-02-25 15:45:36 Disapointed ANIC has cut ties with the NRA even though the NRA has long worked to keep guns out of criminal/mentally ill hands by doing things such as pressuring lawmakers to fix the NICS (background) system and supporting sensible gun laws like banning bump stocks. 

Goodbye.

1065 2018-02-25 15:40:53 Babies are just as sacred after they are born.  Stand with us for protecting our children.  Time to ban automatic rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  Be the savior we need.

1067 2018-02-25 15:39:14 Just make bump stocks an NFA Title II weapon
1068 2018-02-25 15:38:49 The catch is there are limited choices to the stocks you can buy.
1069 2018-02-25 15:37:05 Stocks are meant for long term investments and not for impulsive trading. Buying a stock on a lower price and selling it when its prices are high is purely nonsense.
1070 2018-02-25 15:37:01 In the old days he would be locked in stocks on public display to humiliate him.  This man has no shame.  He is a disgrace to law enforcement and should turn in his badge.
1071 2018-02-25 15:37:00 Trumps actions by signing the bill to allow assault weapons to be sold to people with mental conditions , helped create this horrible tragedy. When people have assault weapons they do need bump stocks - these already are weapons of war. Trump took NRA blood money - "Never Again"
1072 2018-02-25 15:36:34 Dude. Banning bump stocks is one step out of 10 million in effective gun control. No one is saying it is the only solution. Why are you so fixated on this one thing
1073 2018-02-25 15:36:33 Very Few People want to fly with you. Your ticket sells are about to plummet, as are your stocks. Enjoy your vacay!
1074 2018-02-25 15:34:59 Ahahaha so by banning bump stocks its going to help save people from being slaughtered in a crowded school ? I guarantee you any1 could do just as much damage with a 12 gauge shot gun or even a pistol. Bullets are fucking bullets. Lead will kill you at a high enough velocity
1075 2018-02-25 15:34:07 February is suppose to be a lit month with all these amazing releases. But with all the very limited stocks, delayed releases and confusing infos made this month a total L, ah wells off to much better things in life.

1082 2018-02-25 15:32:29 Better background checks and a ban on bump stocks is a start, but more important is a ban on assault-style guns and a gun registry.
1083 2018-02-25 15:32:01 @CNNSotu Why not talk about decreasing the magazine size to say 5 or 8..Why not talk about getting rid of bump stocks?? Why not talk about education of weapons?? Why is CNN so mean (bully) to everyone they interview??
1084 2018-02-25 15:31:37 We don't own weapons in everyway. Automatic weapons are illegal. I agree we need certain things banned, but not all semi automatic weapons. Trump is right by uping the age, stricter background, and banning all types of bump stocks...
1085 2018-02-25 15:31:06 #AskWarren at what point in this bull market cycle would you look for high dividend paying stocks
1086 2018-02-25 15:30:50 Banning bump stocks is to slow down the lazy tools without weapon skills. Which is most of them.

But I’m really not here to try to educate you on mass epidemiology and public policy while you’re high af, that’s just a waste of my time
1087 2018-02-25 15:30:43 Suppressors are extensively used and recommended in self-defense situations. They are designed to cut the noise level down to a safer level so that it won’t damage your ears without hearing protection. But yeah, bump-fire stocks need to go.

1094 2018-02-25 15:27:31 Ever heard of binary triggers, hellfire triggers, bump stocks?
1095 2018-02-25 15:27:00 LTC makes up less than 1% of my portfolio, I don’t know what your holding, but I’m pretty sure if you just hold on you will eventually make more money than if you would have sold everything and dumped it into stocks.
1096 2018-02-25 15:26:33 Not for universal background checks, not the assault weapons ban, not banning bump stocks, all of which gun owners support. As for 2A they are a gun lobby advocacy group who no longer stick to 2A but are fully culture warriors. Stick to your Breitbart and Stephen Miller...
1097 2018-02-25 15:25:57 A thought: Trader Joe's stocks some fairly inexpensive bags of riced cauliflower that you can also freeze.

1101 2018-02-25 15:25:13 We can't tamper with our 2nd amendment rights. No one is asking that. We are simpler asking for a ban on "bump stocks" and a raise on the age limit for purchasing weapons along with restricting sales of AR-15 to military for military use only.
1102 2018-02-25 15:24:31 I am scared of corrupt finance ministers who don’t put their family stocks into a blind trust.
1103 2018-02-25 15:23:43 The NRA literally exists solely to increase profits for gun manufacturers, who don’t even *make* bump-stocks, as I understand it.
1104 2018-02-25 15:23:11 Vast majority of  gun deaths are caused by handguns anyway so the whole AR15 thing is as much a red herring as the bump stocks
1105 2018-02-25 15:22:44 Our cultural is that we have a right to not just guns, but assault weapons and bump stocks, that this right supersedes safety, that we blame mental health issues then govt cuts funding to mental health services leaving the ill to figure out how to get care. Reap what you sow.
1106 2018-02-25 15:22:08 Bump stocks should be banned for sure. To me I have never needed it only to go shooting at the range with is 100% legal. I don’t think they should be banned but I think we need better communication between people to keep these guns out of peoples hands that cant properly use them
1107 2018-02-25 15:21:02 Looks like some CrossFit gyms partner with some meal prep services, so you can order and pick up the meals at the gym (or the gym stocks them). I assume other gyms likewise partner with some meal prep companies.
1108 2018-02-25 15:21:02 Where did this notion of “retail buy/sell stocks in the morning and institutions buy/sell in the afternoon” come from?
1109 2018-02-25 15:20:56 @RepThomasMassie the Kentucky shooting and sandy hook and columbine who used already purchased gun is All the more reason to BAN ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS. BAN ALL AR15’s and THE LIKE. BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS.
1110 2018-02-25 15:20:53 You got to understand the market before you find yourself buying dead stocks... You need to know when to buy and when sell #stocks
1111 2018-02-25 15:20:32 The worst mass shooting in US history was carried out by a guy with bump stocks on military style weapons from a hotel room. That's a tired argument too. Stop walking around the problem and address it.
1112 2018-02-25 15:20:23 @GStephanopoulos I support changes in the gun laws. I support the ban of the bump stocks. But the American public needs to hear both sides of the argument in unbiased fashion. Let people make up their own minds.
1113 2018-02-25 15:19:54 >@FLGovScott @marcorubio @FLSenate To protect our children & our future, banning assault rifles is a priority. I support and expect you to support universal background checks, 14 day wait periods, domestic violence bans, no sales by private owners, no bump stocks. #NeverAgain
1114 2018-02-25 15:19:44 If we’re changing gun laws with age limitations, banning bump stocks and trying to remove the sale of AR-15’s; then we NEED TO RAISE THE VOTING AGE TO 21.  Anyone 18 shouldn’t be making judgement calls about our laws if they’re too immature to own a gun. PERIOD.
1115 2018-02-25 15:19:40 And bump stocks and silencers. (They are NOT needed for self-defense)
1116 2018-02-25 15:19:21 The NRA will not back upping the age for the purchase of assault weapons, the banning of bump stocks or universal background checks. What does this tell us? That money is more important to this organization than the lives of children.
1117 2018-02-25 15:19:03 Investors borrowing record sums to bet on stocks exacerbated this month’s selloff, after they were hit with calls to reduce those obligations and forced to sell shares to raise cash.
1118 2018-02-25 15:18:07 I’m curious for your take on @blackrock divesting any gun manufacturers stocks in its funds.
1119 2018-02-25 15:17:34 To your point...bump stocks and AR-15's are therefore unnecessary in our communities.
1120 2018-02-25 15:17:31 No one is blaming law-abiding gun owners for serial shootings...No one is trying to take their guns...What people want is a sensible interpretation of the 2nd amendment...Average folks should not be able to buy weapons of war, bump stocks, or extended clips...THIS IS SENSIBLE!!!

1122 2018-02-25 15:16:00 Raising the age to 21, bump stocks, gun shows
1123 2018-02-25 15:15:44 Focusing on trailing or next year's P/E ratio can help set short-term price targets on #stocks you own. But, we also need to be aware that this choice can often result in selling potential multi-year compounders too soon. #FoodForThought
1124 2018-02-25 15:15:28 Careful it is like the FTSE markets Stocks & Shares if you want to take that ride.
1125 2018-02-25 15:15:27 Stephanopoulos: The ATF says they don't have the authority right now to ban bump stocks. The president's now said he wants those to be banned. Will the NRA back that?
Loesch: The NRA doesn't back any ban.
1126 2018-02-25 15:15:18 I think Buffett is stuck in a position where he CAN’T say stocks are overbought because he is so damn famous - he would be responsible for a crash the next day. That said, the snippet in the letter about past BRK drawdowns was a pretty clear signal of what he thinks.
1127 2018-02-25 15:15:11 And so this has what to do with enacting gun laws that take assault weapons off the street?  Even if it was a tiny industry, encouraging the sale and use of large capacity magazines, assault weapons, bump stocks should be illegal, no?
1128 2018-02-25 15:14:44 @SenToomey not telling the whole truth. The AR 15 is much more dangerous than a traditional hunting shotgun. It is capable of holding 30 rounds in some cases it can hold drums with 100 rounds. BAN ALL AR15s AND THE LIKE. BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS. BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ALL GUN SALES.
1129 2018-02-25 15:14:37 And yet, each day, I can feel the Parkland and Las Vegas events fade into the past while nothing happens. I'd make a big bet that even bump stocks won't get banned. (Slippery slope to banning AR's!) This is a full auto machine gun she is shooting. What the hell is wrong with us?
1130 2018-02-25 15:14:20 That number is very misleading. They are an insurance company with debt & liabilities. By law and for their credit rating they must keep a large portion in liquid securities. Some smaller portion of that is available for stocks or M&A
1131 2018-02-25 15:14:01 Bittereindercoin stocks just went up!
1132 2018-02-25 15:13:55 That’s the thing that some of the gun owners don’t understand, no one is trying to take away your guns. We are trying to ban assault riffles and bump stocks. What purpose would a regular citizen need to own a military grade weapon.
1133 2018-02-25 15:13:19 Geez- how does this move forward and bans on AR15 or bump stocks are denied?
1134 2018-02-25 15:13:01 Investors Buying Stocks With Debt Leaves Markets Vulnerable...Americans  buy most everything with debt, most have a negative net worth, owing  more that they own, in our never ending Pyramid scheme of, lets look  wealthy!
1135 2018-02-25 15:12:41 So when does the crazy stop? People with bump stocks, assault weapons, these things that Congress has allowed the ease of individuals getting weapons. The NRA just wants more guns they don't want to enter #TheFrayofCommonSense #PhucktheNRA
1136 2018-02-25 15:12:26 Because the fish stocks were massively overfished and CFP has brought it back to sustainable levels. Without a CFP (remember fish don't respect borders) we'd have no fishing at all. Also, we sold most of our fishing rights to Dutch companies, your Government did that!
1137 2018-02-25 15:11:34 Yes 3% big threat to stocks. But bonds no escape from stocks. As soaring rates will bring them down. MM rates very low! Banks ripping off savers! High yield stocks no better! Yes investors have a problem!

1140 2018-02-25 15:08:36 Ya, I kinda miss ol obama. I was able put in new hardwood floors in my house with the profits I made with my gun stocks, the stock market kind. He also motivated me  to upgrade my NRA membership to  Life Member.

1146 2018-02-25 15:03:34 It’s upside down.
1147 2018-02-25 15:03:24 Lol...so out of spite toward me you won’t agree that bump stocks should be banned? That infantile remark doesn’t surprise me at all. You’d be a horrible role model for kids.  Don’t have them and don’t teach.
1148 2018-02-25 15:02:47 This is not a gun issue, the school, the sheriff department and the FBI failed us.  Fix the NICS system yes, get rid of bump stocks Okay.  The Sheriff at the town hall wanted more power?  He didn't enforce what he has and how many others has the school Promise Program protected?
1149 2018-02-25 15:02:46 Literally a million things can go wrong. A handgun against an AR15 doesn't stand a chance. More guns is not the answer, it is the problem. Ban all military type rifles and bump stocks to civilians. They are weapons of war and don't belong ,in our society
1150 2018-02-25 15:02:22 .@RickSantorum Rifles May only be used in 1% of shootings but what % of school shootings? Mass shootings? And what kind of rifles? Those with large capacity magazines. Those where bump stocks have been added. STFU!
1151 2018-02-25 15:01:53 My tweets are 90% representative of what I buy for stocks, the gap is due to myself not very active on buying and selling, plus I have a position I’ve owned for years and not interested in selling
1152 2018-02-25 15:00:23 “Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of media pundits.” 
— Buffet and Munger
1153 2018-02-25 15:00:16 Maybe bump stocks shouldn't be legal. Semi automatic hand guns can be just as effective. A lot of people use semi auto rifles, and it's not for shooting up schools, etc.
1154 2018-02-25 15:00:03 Omg! Bb! Are smart units openline? Do u have stocks? Ily! Haha
1155 2018-02-25 14:59:14 2) "derisking" and going to gilts instead of stocks. Again, for long term investments, this seems insane - for a few years market may slump, but for any long time frame it had beaten gilts, no? There are various ratios, but uuk seems to be say go with all gilts. Is this standard?

1157 2018-02-25 14:58:24 And Obama's ATF approved bump stocks. Makes you go hmmmm..........
1158 2018-02-25 14:58:12 Simply NOT true.

Obama did NOT "approve of bump stocks". The ATF under Obama deemed that the language of the law prevented bump stocks from being regulated because of "no moving parts" according to the law.

1160 2018-02-25 14:57:38 Definitely. Beyond that everyone needs to dump their stocks! Period!
1161 2018-02-25 14:57:31 Obama did NOT "approve of bump stocks". The ATF under Obama deemed that the language of the law prevented bump stocks from being regulated because of "no moving parts" according to the law.
1162 2018-02-25 14:57:24 You make solid points. Many failures. What’s your position on an assault rifle ban or bump stocks ban? If AR-15 were illegal would less people have died, not just in Parkland but many of the other massacres?
1163 2018-02-25 14:56:59 Right on @Emma4Change-it's harder to rescue a dog than get an AR15;a pissed off 18 y/o shouldn't be able to waltz into @Walmart & get a rifle. & bump stocks?- just no. Time to wake up these politicians, @NRA mems, gun sellers& smarmy lobbyists and drag them into the 21st century!
1164 2018-02-25 14:56:01 Bump stocks are legal. Even if they aren't no semi automatic rifles should be legal. Nobody needs one, but they are very effective weapons of mass murder. It's that simple.
1165 2018-02-25 14:55:20 Update din kita if she gets stocks. Kaso idk kung ilan pa nakapila sa kanya hahahuhu
1166 2018-02-25 14:54:14 Preach sis. I’d also like to point out that yes the stock market is doing well,   but who does that actually help? If you don’t own any stocks then it’s just a talking point for Trump supporters.
1167 2018-02-25 14:54:13 Ban both. Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks. More strictly regulate purchases. Strengthen background checks, close loopholes. Require guns be licensed and registered. Grow a spine. Stop this bullshit.
1168 2018-02-25 14:53:58 Some States are trying to do things to stop this (CT did per Sandy Hook) and it’s ridiculous that the NRA leadership has remained complicit in believing its even NEEDED (& are even against Bump Stocks for that matter). So yes, they have blood on their hands, too.
1169 2018-02-25 14:53:51 You will be a good financial educator , I was raised telling to save money for later so I never bought any stocks early when they were cheap lol
1170 2018-02-25 14:53:31 Certain gun stocks perform well after shootings. Until Florida. We are about to see more gun companies go under.
1171 2018-02-25 14:51:25 Trump & his lying mouth pieces say "Trump should be praised for acting so decisively about bump stocks, since Obama didn't do anything about them." Neglecting to mention GOP fought everything Obama tried. Convenient memories they have when they want to shift blame for inaction.
1172 2018-02-25 14:49:46 Assault rifles. Bump stocks. Any automatic and semi automatic gun with more than (my opinion) 9rounds. Bombs. Tanks. Hand grenades can list more but that should do it... #banassaultweapons #boycottnra #neveragain #parkland
1173 2018-02-25 14:49:40 #letitrip Bump stocks were used in a total of one (1) mass shooting and they do not turn a semi automatic rifle into an automatic please do research before making ridiculous claims
1174 2018-02-25 14:49:35 Sell their stocks

1177 2018-02-25 14:46:21 These kids who were survivors of a mass shooting had to fight tooth and nail just to stop bump stocks. They just want regulations and to stop these kinds of mass shootings to stop happening.
1178 2018-02-25 14:44:14 The ATF didn’t approve the sale so much as current law limits the ATF’s authority to regulate certain bump stocks.
1179 2018-02-25 14:44:04 The blame starts with Congress. Need stricter gun laws. Extensive background checks, mental health reform to see the red flags and keep people with mental health issues from getting a gun which Trump nixed that out of law.  No bump stocks and no assault weapons
1180 2018-02-25 14:43:16 huhu yung case talaga grabe ang cute kaso walang stocks :((
1181 2018-02-25 14:43:06 its simply not necessary to have a high velocity weapon for any reason, let alone large clips or bump stocks.
1182 2018-02-25 14:42:53 Spend money on good stocks
1183 2018-02-25 14:42:41 AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles, such as the M-16, but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing ONLY ONE ROUND W/ EACH PULL OF THE TRIGGER.

It's why bump stocks are being banned, since it turned 1 shot to semi-auto. Not Machine Guns
1184 2018-02-25 14:41:16 It is not a matter of giving them up..but keeping them out of the wrong hands somehow, and possibly eliminate accessories like gat cranks and bump stocks which some crazies can use like the Las Vegas shooter.
1185 2018-02-25 14:40:57 I think at least one was full auto and if it was just one guy he could have had a rifle in ea arm since accuracy didnt seem to be an issue, but he couldn't have operated that way with bump stocks. So, we have no clue what really happened, the lack of real info 4 mos later...

1187 2018-02-25 14:40:16 @P_diwan, Pranaam Gurudev. 
You discussed about EIL &  Kirloskar Ferrous on 27th Dec2017 in interview with @Nigel__DSouza. Hope it's right time to both the stocks? Hope you vll reply this time :)
1188 2018-02-25 14:40:16 "Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo confirmed that officials believe at least some of the guns found in the hotel room were modified"  The AR seems very unlikely, the bump stocks are crap and we dont know which guns were fitted with them or if they were just in the room!
1189 2018-02-25 14:40:04 Has anyone actually seen what bump stocks let a gun do? It’s absolutely terrifying. And absolutely legal. The fact that there’s even a debate about them is mental.
1190 2018-02-25 14:39:34 its not about you mark, its the dues you pay to an organization that has flooded this country with guns, lobbyists who refused cut down on magazine size, bump stocks, silencers, trigger cranks.  I just don't understand why you want military grade weapons to be used on civilians.
1191 2018-02-25 14:39:27 How many bullets in a clip for this gun? How many bump stocks have been designed for this gun? How many school kids have been murdered by this gun?
1192 2018-02-25 14:36:45 Ang dami ko na ding stocks na ulam sa ref namin
1193 2018-02-25 14:35:13 The NRA has never asked me as a life member of the NRA what I think about bump stocks background checks or any other issues involving guns. Does @NRA really represent the membership.
1194 2018-02-25 14:35:01 #AskWarren If you aren't buying companies or adding to stocks because of valuation, why should we buy the SPY?
1195 2018-02-25 14:34:50 The search is to look for individual company stocks within a fund. (To confirm whether there are gun companies in your current fund/s or not.) The Barron’s article linked in the Axios article has the company names/ticker symbols.
1196 2018-02-25 14:34:38 Thank you to everyone who approached me and supported my fanart merch hopefully next time stocks would be enough 
#CYPHERinMNL
1197 2018-02-25 14:34:37 The day after the Las Vegas shootings, Congressman Massie proposed a bill making bump stocks legal. He also posted a picture of himself posing with an AR-15 on Facebook. (Since removed) I don't think the people of KY realized what a moron they had elected.
1198 2018-02-25 14:34:10 No actually bump stocks have been On the radar since Nevada and the @NRA  first proposed the idea
1199 2018-02-25 14:33:51 Obama himself didn't, but the ATF under him deemed that some bump stocks contained no moving pieces, thus were not breaking the law
1200 2018-02-25 14:33:32 Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, consistent back ground checks, restrict guns to those guilty of domestic abuse, restrict from this who have documented history of mental illness, restrict from those on the no fly list or he terror watch list, stop the loopholes like gun shows
1201 2018-02-25 14:33:32 You are aware that:
1. Obama is not in office?
2. Bump stocks are not included in current laws, so impossible for any president to regulate?

We are aware that:
1. You either can't or don't read or understand laws.
2. If you can and have read and get the laws? You are a liar.
1202 2018-02-25 14:33:28 #AskWarren Ciao Warren from Italy. Everybody look greedy with stocks these days, is it time to be fearful?
1203 2018-02-25 14:32:13 Why 3% is the scariest number for stocks
1204 2018-02-25 14:31:02 But I was able to be around intelligent black people last night. Had conversations about owning homes and stocks. Sharing Knowledge always  gets me excited.
1205 2018-02-25 14:30:50 Doubtful they even own stocks, so why would they know?
1206 2018-02-25 14:30:10 The real issue is we need to secure schools like govt buildings & airports. We need to address the failures leading up. LE clearly dropped the ball here in months leading up & day of. I’m ok limiting mag cap, bump stocks & other like adaptations s/b illegal.
1207 2018-02-25 14:30:06 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
1208 2018-02-25 14:29:20 I’ve only ever used shotguns. If I’m shooting, I load two shells. I can fire twice, and I need to pause and reload. Even without bump stocks, these guns have magazines that can fire many rounds without reloading, right? That would certainly make them more dangerous.
1209 2018-02-25 14:29:18 Just before his Administration Approved Bump Stocks!
1210 2018-02-25 14:29:17 @vestager @FedericaMog @Europol @Frontex @GOettingerEU US @FBI has security warning on Huawei-ZTE smartphones/networks by unelected Beijing leaders demanding access to EU+US voice,video,data. Is that how they accumulated Daimler+Kuka+etc. stocks ? How to spy on these spies ?
1211 2018-02-25 14:27:28 Common Ground: universal background checks, no military assault weapons to civilians, no bump stocks, increase age to 21, NRA supports gun makers not the common gun owner. The 2nd amendment will always be safe, stop the fear tactics. Teachers don't want guns in class. STOP the BS
1212 2018-02-25 14:27:12 A lot of people have asked me: can you trade stocks with machine learning?

Tl;dr probably yes, but how?
1213 2018-02-25 14:27:03 Have we defined assault rifles yet? If "assault rifles" are auto weapons, those are already restricted. #Trump will make some reasonable change. Bump stocks for example. I don't mind seeing devices that turn semi-auto into auto weapons banned. To me, that's reasonable.
1214 2018-02-25 14:26:47 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope! by #BostonPatriot

1216 2018-02-25 14:24:16 We want to ban rapid fire weapons (and conversion devices like bump stocks) that make mass shootings possible and we want reasonable regulations on ALL firearms and ammo. Why is this so hard for you to understand?
1217 2018-02-25 14:24:01 incredibly bored w/stocks & investing lately.  In the beginning I obsessed over every detail, did me no good.  

Robinhood 'ruined' a lot of that for me.  No commissions, Ended up abandoning everything else, no longer cost-effective to pay to trade.
1218 2018-02-25 14:23:12 Pretty sure you’re wrong on that. ATF, during Obama’s administration, approved of the sale of bump stocks.
1219 2018-02-25 14:21:58 @GStephanopoulos age up on guns . 20 years old and no pump stocks sold from a set date . the N.R.A IS EVERY SCHOOL FRIEND ,THIS ALL THEY HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE KILLER , HELLO ANY ONE HOME IN SCHOOLS ? ITS BEEN 25 YEARS OF DEAD CHILDERN .YOU FAILED !!!!WITH ONE DEAD CHILD YOU FAILED
1220 2018-02-25 14:21:22 Right. Agreed. But stocks were bought heavily  into the close, not sold.
1221 2018-02-25 14:21:05 Talked to a friend last night about gun control and suggested the following:

1) A ban on AR-15s and all similar weapons
2) A ban on Kevlar vests (for civilians), bump stocks, and any item that can be used to make an attack more deadly
3) Strict controls on bullets 1/

1225 2018-02-25 14:17:33 Typical lib. The other day I told a lib friend POTUS was going to ban bump stocks and she said he's only doing it for his own publicity, no acknowledgement it was a good thing.  WTF
1226 2018-02-25 14:17:21 The President put a ban on bump stocks last week moron. Maybe watch something else besides CNN every now and then. Also tell me how it’s the NRA’s fault?
1227 2018-02-25 14:16:33 I watch your show every morning and if I may say you are very bright and smart and beautiful keep up the great job. My question for Warren is: does he own or have any interest in steel stocks, especially with potential infrastructure planned and dumping duties being applied.

1233 2018-02-25 14:13:25 It is not the entire NRA that isnt for baning bump stocks or raising the age to buy Guns. It is the NRA spokesmen that dont want to. So Maybe they should take a vote of all members. Instead of assuming 5 million members agree.

1235 2018-02-25 14:10:10 Thanks! How adult of you to insult, not engage in a debate with a gun owner who has openly campaigned for better bkgd checks and banning of bump stocks. Insults from strangers (with 14 followers) are as effective as a fart in a wind storm. Good day, sir.
1236 2018-02-25 14:09:56 This is personal- I know and maybe petty- definitely. I hate the way she stocks around her podium- all hunch over - seriously looks like a buzzard.
1237 2018-02-25 14:09:40 Guess what....there's a simple solution to this...ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Simple.
1238 2018-02-25 14:08:34 The us vs them mentality on gun laws is disappointing.  I own guns. Have a concealed carry license.  I also believe in outlawing high capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers, I support gun free zones, strict background checks and mandatory gun education classes for ownership.

1240 2018-02-25 14:08:27 I would invest in dividend stocks.  $2M could get you $80-90K per year + growth.  Use the growth for the fun stuff and leave the initial investment.

Dana Loesch "The NRA doesn't back ANY ban." 

Enough said.
1243 2018-02-25 14:08:01 • Bring back the assault weapon ban which expired in 2004
• bam bump stocks 
• Ban all self-loading weapons
• Ban on gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence
• Ban on gun ownership for people on the US terror watch list
• Gun buy-back program ... 2/3

1247 2018-02-25 14:05:51 I don’t think any ceo of a company that runs hedge funds & shorts stocks & currencies for gain has any credibility in our society. This whole concept is a farse, a fraud, a fake ( heard that b4?) way of making a living. It should be banned. Keep it for the dog teach & horse races
1248 2018-02-25 14:05:51 Side note: The NRA does not allow the use of bump stocks on their shooting ranges.
1249 2018-02-25 14:04:09 They have hurt lots of folks by obstructing passage & implementation of common sense gun control. Absence of reasonable gun control (e.g., banning bump stocks) is responsibilty of NRA which in point of fact has hurt those shot in Las Vegas for example

1263 2018-02-25 13:56:04 People who hold defense stocks should get the same treatment that the gun industry and NRA are getting now. Dry up their funding, and see how fast peace breaks out.
1264 2018-02-25 13:55:59 Assault rifles are made to kill people and kill them rapidly. They are weapons for the military. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks.
1265 2018-02-25 13:55:41 How many mass shooters have been under 21? 'Bump' stocks apply only to certain firearms. The problem is the availability of weapons developed for the military to civilians.  Be remembered for taking a man-size stand for what you know is right,
1266 2018-02-25 13:55:35 But you don’t have to admit Obama was the one who approved bump stocks it’s ok I know you guys don’t really care about facts

1271 2018-02-25 13:53:38 One of talented player ben stocks
1272 2018-02-25 13:53:18 So ban bump stocks for law abiding citizens. Then only bad guys will have them. That’s really smart. . She is using her weapon properly. The 2A is not for hunting.  It’s to make us equal to the government.
1273 2018-02-25 13:53:11 Ha.  As u say.   Buy stocks
1274 2018-02-25 13:51:07 No to the raising age to 21 and eliminating bump stocks.
1275 2018-02-25 13:50:29 Stocks will drop come Monday, nice sell off.
1276 2018-02-25 13:49:03 Ah, yes. the 3D printer. Another aspect of policy: Would bump stocks be illegal to SELL or illegal to OWN?
1277 2018-02-25 13:47:08 And we will call for banning AR's & bump stocks. That doesnt mean we are anti 2nd amendment either. But its doing more than sharing guard dog stories and trying to arm teachers. (3 end

1281 2018-02-25 13:41:03 Bump stocks should have been banned after Last Vegas. You already overturned Obama's EO on sales of guns to mentally ill. Raising age to 21
1282 2018-02-25 13:39:37 As we've seen with bump stocks, binary triggers, and AR pistols, it doesn't matter what the law says, the gun community will build around it and loophole so the only answer is ban them all. With how grey the laws already are, compromise will take decades. Ban them all now.

1291 2018-02-25 13:33:51 The NRA has used lobbyist to make it easier for the youth and people with mental health issues to obtain guns. They lobbied for bump stocks that make weapons more deadly. They've even lobbied against common sense gun safety laws. This is the right .
1292 2018-02-25 13:33:08 The AR-15 itself is semi-auto which just means it automatically reloads the next cartridge, but a trigger pull by your finger is required for every bullet fired.

Bump stocks work by bumping the trigger against your finger over you pull the first shot thus firing many quickly.
1293 2018-02-25 13:33:03 (bump stocks)
1294 2018-02-25 13:32:54 Imagine the mentality of anyone who goes and buys gun company stocks right after a mass shooting. Evil.  Sick. They should be selling with no shorting allowed.

1300 2018-02-25 13:28:49 き...kiss×sis...
1301 2018-02-25 13:27:35 Just rereading Elizabeth Knox great novel The Vintners Luck a bout a love affair between a man and an angel . It's good on angels too  , especially the history and lore of fallen angels. I bought it in the London bookshop Gay's The Word   that stocks many fascinating books
1302 2018-02-25 13:27:27 Anderlecht's home game with Mouscron will be watched in the director's box by new owner Marc Coucke. End of almost 50 years control of club by the Vanden Stocks. A little doubt about actual handover - was scheduled for March 1st.
1303 2018-02-25 13:26:48 Their stock will decide if they made the right decision.  
Lets talk again in a couple of weeks and take a look how their stocks respond.
1304 2018-02-25 13:26:23 Yes pal, usual scenes
1305 2018-02-25 13:25:14 We have to start preventing this somewhere. I'll leave it to others for the specifics. A tighter regulatory system is necessary. I don't want automatic weapons,  where you squeeze the trigger and more than one round is shot. I don't want bump stocks. I don't want AR 15s.
1306 2018-02-25 13:24:43 This is blatant historical revisionism. He diverted food from Bengal to buff up backup stocks in Britain. I've never seen such a garbage article. Maybe read contemporary Indian sources, Gandhi, Bose, Nehru. Any of them.
1307 2018-02-25 13:23:35 DB - direct benefit, ASS (!) assets, LIA, liability ... not THAT esoteric, surely?
Stocks, I will pass on, if I may :-)
1308 2018-02-25 13:21:24 @jamesmitchel018 where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
1309 2018-02-25 13:21:24 Your stance is to sell more guns! Your defense is of gun company stocks! Great marketing though using the 2a and rally around the flag! #seerightthruU #GunReformNow
1310 2018-02-25 13:21:13 Sounds like you identified more assault weapons that need to be banned.  Legislation: Ban all assault weapons and bump stocks! Keep gefensive guns for protection and rifles for hunting. We didn’t need war weapons killing machines. #BanAssaultRifles
1311 2018-02-25 13:19:29 Angelica, lives on Laguna Ave with 9 cats.

1313 2018-02-25 13:18:37 Tyler recorded   like   stocks ?
1314 2018-02-25 13:18:22 if the last six mass murderers did not own and use AR 15s, hundreds of people would not have been shot. the Vegas police moved quickly and still dozens were shot. the NRA wants to ban bump stocks. congress needs to act.
1315 2018-02-25 13:17:52 Bump stocks, hellfire triggers, binary triggers and other modifications are meant to bypass the automatic weapon laws. #politicsnation
1316 2018-02-25 13:17:02 Let's see how their stocks do this week!!! Sell,sell,sell..
1317 2018-02-25 13:16:06 One thing, BTW, that higher long rates will greatly alleviate, as long as stocks don’t plunge (!)
EG, UK DBs have seen actuarial deficit dwindle from £413bkn (21% LIA) 18mos ago to just £51bln (3% of LIA) principally because LIA dn 14% (rates) w ASS +6% (stocks)
1318 2018-02-25 13:16:01 Congress needs to do real WORK to make gun back ground checks work, ridiculous bump stocks go away and setting in place barriers for other countries and corporate interests trying to influnce our destiny.  Stop pointing fingers and get some work done!

1320 2018-02-25 13:12:43 10550 Old St Augustine Rd, Jacksonville, FL 32257. This isnt just one or two items. The out of stocks are too many to list- The manager need not manage anymore if they dont notice such massive, constant shortages.
1321 2018-02-25 13:11:07 I also think some law needs to change.  Ban bump stocks.  Make it federally required to report felonies to the NCIS.
1322 2018-02-25 13:11:00 想像ダイアリー
1323 2018-02-25 13:10:38 The answer isn’t to add more guns and turn schools into armed camps, it’s to restrict access to high capacity/rapid fire guns, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and a thorough back ground check.
1324 2018-02-25 13:10:26 GET ALL OF THEM! CLEAR THE STOCKS!
1325 2018-02-25 13:09:35 つまり水瀬いのりさんは餃子撮っていいか聞くのか...
1326 2018-02-25 13:09:31 Investors have borrowed a record $642.8 billion against their portfolios as they try to pocket bigger gains by ramping up their exposure to stocks
1327 2018-02-25 13:08:59 I need to get better at shorting stocks of these companies who cave to the mob, when I first get wind of it.
1328 2018-02-25 13:08:51 Look...personally I don't OWN an AR type weapon. Not because I don't think they're "scary" or "dangerous" looking.. I just never liked a plastic stock on a rifle. I prefer wood stocks.

Just because "I" don't like them, doesn't mean everyone ELSE shouldn't have the option. See?
1329 2018-02-25 13:05:48 Sverre also took 19 stocks off Gothenburg, maybe you guys should moneymatch for the best crews player title
1330 2018-02-25 13:05:47 it is weirdly. but need more stocks.
1331 2018-02-25 13:04:57 Christian is too busy trying to ban bump stocks and then bullying them into brown snakes.
1332 2018-02-25 13:01:50 I am actually looking for some low IV strategies on stocks. Might look at long strangles too. Let's see. Too much theta
1333 2018-02-25 13:00:42 This is a really profound statement. Stocks incentivize over-charging customers and cashing out dividends. Huge contrast to token models that incentivize continuous investments into product usage and network effects.
1334 2018-02-25 13:00:03 The policy of being too cautious is the greatest risk of all. #forex #stocks
1335 2018-02-25 13:00:02 I agree rockets, machine guns , bump stocks should all be illegal.  And are. An AR-15 us not automatic. It's semi-automatic and if I choose to make it fully automatic it's highly illegal.
1336 2018-02-25 12:59:55 Drain the Swamp huh he has added to it and letting Ivanka and Jared run the show on Guns Trump sounding allot like Obama Sessions cannot write laws only enforce them. He can not order Sessions on Bump Stocks You can vote at 18 unfair to take away  right to buy guns
1337 2018-02-25 12:59:16 Oh man, that is too much to ask for.  Got to choose something more detail like, talent for buying and selling stocks.  We must be "humble"
1338 2018-02-25 12:58:46 Defenders of the semi automatic & bump stocks say it is just fun to shoot. Why not make it illegal to sell AR-15s to citizens but create semi automatic gun ranges where you pay for the use of these guns in a controlled safe environment.
1339 2018-02-25 12:57:36 @MurrayCampaign 1) We have background checks 2) Banning magazines won't fix anything 3) assault rifles were banned in 1986 4) Bump stocks don't create machine guns (banning them won't help anything, either).
1340 2018-02-25 12:57:19 @ThroughTheGaps The UK will leave the EU 29 March 2019 - what does this mean?

1341 2018-02-25 12:55:15 Chemical industry Stocks looking good for this year ! With expected returns of 15-30% returns
1342 2018-02-25 12:53:59 Indeed. It’s difficult to track the flows of spending and how they are accumulating into stocks of savings. But, to generalise, I would say that Govt policy has enable a large movement of money to flow upwards to the rich via income tax and corporation tax cuts.

1345 2018-02-25 12:51:27 You’re pathetic. Ban all semi automatic guns and bump stocks that turn semis into even faster murder machines. Or plan to be unelectable.
1346 2018-02-25 12:50:53 Good night mate?
1347 2018-02-25 12:50:33 They did get investment from private companies, like # Hashed...The crowdsale is the ICO-people can't but stocks/shares in the company, they get the token, which they hope to go up in value, give them a ROI.
1348 2018-02-25 12:49:39 When Mr Buffett talks about keeping stocks in portfolio of the average investor as opposed to bonds, what “long term” time frames is recommended for somebody 5-10 years from retirement #AskWarren
1349 2018-02-25 12:48:27 The AR 15 is the weapon of choice for mass shooters: easy to learn easy to load easy to shoot. Very deadly. I have no problems with shotguns. I have no problem with semiautomatic rifles as long as they can't convert to automatics. Ban the AR15 and bump stocks
1350 2018-02-25 12:48:18 BTW, Trump IS eliminating bump stocks...has been against them all the way.  Why is the Left ignoring that???
1351 2018-02-25 12:46:35 SM stocks shooting up
1352 2018-02-25 12:45:55 How is this not an issue? Paul Ryan promised to ban bump stocks and their still available the last time I checked, Republicans are all talk, no action and owned by the NRA. That’s another thing, how can 4-5 million NRA members dictate what’s right for over 300-million Americans?
1353 2018-02-25 12:44:52 Isn’t he selling stocks and getting into energy and railroad companies?
1354 2018-02-25 12:43:57 Not the @NRAs fault? They lobby for gun oems. They have made it impossible for different govt offices to track & trace guns used in crime. Push for sale of AR15, want conceal carry across all states, support sake of armor piercing bullets. Suppressors & bump stocks. ENABLERS.
1355 2018-02-25 12:43:56 It was not a straight line .... that stock went down 53% over few years in the 80s ... that is why buffet is saying don't borrow money to invest in stocks , timing is not important, buying sound businesses is ...

1358 2018-02-25 12:41:38 More like 44 was all talk no action! Apparently your short term memory has failed you! Do you remember the plethora of mass shootings during  the Obama administration? Why did 44 not do a damn thing! OH WAIT...HE APPROVED THE SALE OF BUMP STOCKS FOR THE PUBLIC!!!
1359 2018-02-25 12:41:13 Changing the age does nothing. Anyone wnting a gun will get one. Anyone wanting bump stocks, to do damage can find out on the internet how create one!  Why not say anyone wanting a gun before 21 must complete a gun safety program by @NRA
1360 2018-02-25 12:40:16 Cars move people from point A to B.  Military assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines have only one purpose - killing.  So, no, they are not the same.  Surely you aren’t as stupid as you appear?  #BoycottNRA
1361 2018-02-25 12:39:08 @AnthonyCumiaxyz hello sir, should we be shorting the stocks on these Companies dropping the NRA? Thanks
1362 2018-02-25 12:38:13 STUPID! a rifle is only an assault weapon because of bump stocks, that Obama approved, that turns any rifle, including the AR-15 into a machine gun! It is bump stocks that need to be banned! EDUCATE YOURSELF! So tired of stupid people commenting on shit they know nothing about!

1364 2018-02-25 12:36:43 How about changing the age for buying an automatic weapons to 21. Or banning bump stocks. Or just improving background checks

1370 2018-02-25 12:27:14 Did U ask OBAMA that question? A Plethora of mass shooting and he did nothing except speech after speech to share his condolences on National TV! He approved Bump Stocks that turns a rifle into a machine gun! Another Obama's legacy that Trump is about to kill! YES! @POTUS
1371 2018-02-25 12:26:54 Let’s talk solutions! Let’s ban bump stocks, put a federal age restriction on buying guns, start a watch list, and put armed guards/metal detectors at our schools. We should probably glance at psychiatric hold laws as well.

Taking away our right to own guns is not a solution.

1373 2018-02-25 12:24:10 I have read the articles, and watched the Youtube videos.

Gun nuts' laughing about AR-15's being called "assault rifles" are being extremely disingenuous.  The fact is, they can legally mimic assault rifles with bump stocks, binary triggers, etc.

1374 2018-02-25 12:22:51 Defending cowards because their bullets don’t travel fast enough proves the tide pod generation and non gun owners are clueless 1 shot 1 kill simple
1375 2018-02-25 12:21:29 "The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations." (Bump Stocks)

They're also for ENFORCING current gun laws. So tell me again how they're "AGAINST every proposal?"

1380 2018-02-25 12:14:29 It makes security analysis more EM-like for US investors & more reflexive: How long will can stocks be allowed to fall (likely not long) & how much can US debt/deficits rise before traditional safe haven USTs begin being seen as unsafe?

1386 2018-02-25 12:09:22 The biggest red flag was that they decided to back an asset in its nascent with their reserves instead of their actual currency. They are desperate for funding & taking the same route Kodak, RiotBlockchain & all these other junk rated stocks haven taken to keep the lights on.
1387 2018-02-25 12:07:28 What seems to happen now is the firms wanting fees use other people to pump stocks for them, so they don't get direct involvement.  Follow the money, however.  Who pays Ark Invest or Kallo to talk book?  Both low-valuation holders.

1390 2018-02-25 12:02:31 Its tough arguing w people rather than approaching a logical understanding of people’s perspective to the approach on gun laws. Some people require side arms. I dont think a machine gun or bump stocks are necessary.
1391 2018-02-25 11:53:11 You're not too smart.  Bump stocks and assault weapons need to be banned.  No one wants to take away guns.
1392 2018-02-25 11:52:50 Nice. He should resign like CDC’s Brenda Fitzgerald who owned stocks in tobacco and pharmaceuticals.
1393 2018-02-25 11:51:05 I know bump stocks are novelty item! Meant to waste a lot of ammo and have fun at the range! But unfortunately the very function of bump firing is gun grabbers Trojan Horse.

1397 2018-02-25 11:46:55 I disagree Miss. It is exactly the fight we need to be fighting for. In ATFs own words they said the definition of machine gun and semi-automatic would have to be changed before they could ban bump stocks and devices that increase rate of fire.
1398 2018-02-25 11:44:44 Please! You need to check your sources! Florida just said no to any ban ...oops! US won’t do a damn thing because that’s where the party in charge gets millions! BTW bump stocks? They won’t even bring it up, stop making excuses for your hate filled party!

Very optimistic because a lot of it could fail, but also because a big chunk of it target to decrease employement in the average / long run

1413 2018-02-25 11:32:33 define it as that all you want the ban will be written for semi automatic rifles bump stocks and large magazines which will be successful in protecting schools and communities Christian.
1414 2018-02-25 11:30:46 I'm especially fond of the way Trump's announcement on the bump stocks left everyone speechless for a moment until they remembered the fallback position of just blaming the NRA for everything without thinking
1415 2018-02-25 11:28:27 In other words he suggests something crazy then expects YOU to pay for it!  Typical of him huh - and just when he's drained the treasury almost dry for all the weapons of war he wants to increase his stocks with - he's already taken your health benefits away what's next

1418 2018-02-25 11:24:27 It's going to strip us of access to others' waters. It's also likely going to hamper fishing in our own if fish stocks start to decline again due to lack of international agreement on conserving them.

1432 2018-02-25 11:08:43 @BryanOhioPD hi, there is this guy in bryan, ohio by the name of Marc Beardsley, or at least he claims that's his name and he talks about guns A LOT and how he needs machine guns and AR-15s and how even if bump stocks were forbidden, he could replicate the effect.  1/2
1433 2018-02-25 11:07:57 Agree that bump stocks need to go, but what difference does the size of the magazine make? They can be changed out in seconds. Let’s make sure we respond with gun laws that actually make a difference & save lives, not just meaningless restrictions that don’t address the problem.
1434 2018-02-25 11:07:32 The NRA has gun safety classes, they promote gun locks, and gun safes. The NRA has nothing to do with bump stocks.

1436 2018-02-25 11:06:18 What battle? Trump already thinks we need expanded background checks, age restrictions, banned bump stocks, & automatics are already banned. So your battle is to what? Amend the constitution...the bill of rights...and specifically the 2nd amendment? Good luck with that.
1437 2018-02-25 11:05:07 I'm not on "The Left" I'm NOT a Democrat or a supporter of them or The Republicans, or the rest of our corrupt government while we're at it.

1448 2018-02-25 10:54:08 I don't hear anything but 'shame on you.'  Typical lying NRA speaker.  I have friends who are member of the NRA and they DO want better background checks, and bump-stocks gone, it is the leadership that doesn't.
1449 2018-02-25 10:53:37 Let's keep it real. 97% of Americans want Univ. background ✓s & Comp's are pulling ties due to LaPierre @NRA refusing to give an inch on common sense gun laws ie; semi auto long barrel guns (AR-15) & bump stocks banned! Legal age to 21. Why is this so hard to understand?
1450 2018-02-25 10:50:00 Hey NRA stop giving in when liberals start yelling and screaming. You have agreed to go along with a ban on bump-stocks to appease the leftists. What will the NRA go along with next? Limiting magazine capacity? Where does it end? Give a liberal an inch, they take a mile. Join GOA

1474 2018-02-25 10:03:20 The NRA promotes guns. Period. Buying politicians to change any common sense legislation that puts even a dent in their potential top and bottom line. Assault rifle ban?

1490 2018-02-25 09:36:11 Promises as such is why we worry so much about fully automatic weapons.Semis are not being attacked. Only bump stocks and devices to alter them to fully.

1508 2018-02-25 09:11:47 @nra why would you support a ban on bump-stocks?  You preach and preach about not punishing law-abiding gun owners b/c criminals do bad things, but supporting a ban on bump-stocks is exactly the same thing.  One nut misuses one and everyone else should pay for it?
1509 2018-02-25 09:08:59 That’s a start. Let’s not forget that the Las Vegas shooter was 64. We need to ban assault weapons and bump stocks. We need to get them off the streets and out of the thoughts and hands of mentally unstable people, who want to go down in infamy/history as a mass shooters.
1510 2018-02-25 09:07:46 The gun violence conversation needs to be about gun violence & how we can reduce it.
Conversations that tinker around the edges - mental health, bump stocks, arming teachers - are intentional distractions.
1511 2018-02-25 09:06:32 Aren't there other guns you could enjoy to shoot and wouldn't you give up your enjoyment to get these particular guns with their bump stocks and their ability to obliterate victims off the streets? Think of the bigger picture here.
1512 2018-02-25 09:05:07 He's wrong about bump stocks.  The do not convert a semi-automatic firearm into a full automatic firearm.

1518 2018-02-25 09:01:41 Isn’t the .223 a hunting round and it can be fired from a AR-15.  As far as banning Bump Stocks, that would just be an exercise in stupidity, you don’t need a Bump Stock to rapid fire a simi automatic weapon, 9mm pistols can be bump fired along with just about any simi -auto gun
1519 2018-02-25 09:01:31 It was never rescinded. It expired after ten years, then the NRA-backed GOP blocked the updated version that was supposed to replace it, also blocking over 100 gun-related bills (including comprehensive background checks & bump stocks) from even being brought to floor for debate.
1520 2018-02-25 08:57:22 Of course, the fact that if assault weapons were banned, the issue of bump stocks would be moot.  The only injury a person could inflict with a bump stock if assault weapons were banned would be some cuts and bruises from the idiot throwing it at someone.
1521 2018-02-25 08:55:28 Why should we give up anything even bump stocks when your side isn't willing to give at all?
1522 2018-02-25 08:52:12 Watched @zacksjerryrig patiently explain an AR 15 gun and how bump stocks work and I am so blown away. I've never touched or seen gun, but why do normal people need a gun like THAT? I HATE guns cos it's scary

1548 2018-02-25 08:29:08 It's just that no one really cares about bump stocks. Serious shooters don't use them. They are quite inaccurate. They are a novelty item. This is one of those things the GOP can give way on so they can look responsible. It is not a significant concession.
1549 2018-02-25 08:28:06 By the way I’m for significant common sense changes in how we regulate gun sales. Significant. We need mandatory 10-14 day cooling period off nationwide, laws to prevent mentally ill, $$ to treat mentally ill, smaller magazines, get rid of outrageous size mags, ban bump stocks,
1550 2018-02-25 08:27:35 You imply that we must repeal the 2nd amendment which would violate our constitutional rights. An armed population owns its govt as an unarmed one is owned by its govt. Stricter background checks, increasing min age, and banning bump stocks is heading in the right direction...
1551 2018-02-25 08:26:00 Want to know where stocks are going next? Jeffrey Gundlach says take a look at bitcoin.

"Strangely, bitcoin seems to be the poster child for social mood and market mood," Gundlach, founder of DoubleLine Capital, told CNBC.

What do you usually look for before investing?
1552 2018-02-25 08:24:19 @sm_sears Going through this week's papers before they are recycled. Thursday's WSJ front page is about S&P 500 powered by three stocks. Haven't studied it but does that mean you can tip over the index with the right paper?

1570 2018-02-25 08:03:00 Hilarious. NRA has a mere 5m members. That’s 0.01% of the population numb nuts. Besides, you can’t buy stocks with food stamps.

1583 2018-02-25 07:56:30 He's just been saying he supports the ban of bump stocks, stricter background checks and waiting periods, etc. basically giving into the dems & going against a big part of what his election was based on.

1587 2018-02-25 07:51:41 Denver & Denver County have already banned bump stocks, it was easy! Anyone caught with one will be fined and the bump stock will be confiscated. Take that NRA! There will be undercover police officers at firing ranges looking for them! This is how it's done!
1588 2018-02-25 07:51:19 What’s your plan for the banning for bump stocks and raising the age of gun ownership.  This is less than what is required, so let’s see if you can even get this right!
1589 2018-02-25 07:51:07 Actually, hate to burden you with facts, the NRA publicly supported a ban on bump stocks.

1592 2018-02-25 07:50:07 They know what they are doing.

1593 2018-02-25 07:49:21 It sounds like blocking him was a good choice! I don't see why making it harder for people with mental illnesses to gain access to guns, or banning bump-stocks, is so controversial. It seems like common sense to me, but I guess that's not common.
1594 2018-02-25 07:49:16 President Trump is putting in legislation to do away with bump stocks. Changing age to 21 for AR 15 and allowing teachers that want to carry concealed. Which is already legal in 9 states.  Better background checks. Vets/police as armed guards at schools.

1597 2018-02-25 07:46:49 Ballparking it, only .02% of the adult US population belong to the NRA. Guess that’s why they feel they need those 30 round magazines and bump stocks.
1598 2018-02-25 07:43:28 Wow you guys. We don’t want your fucking guns. Keep them. Just no more assault type weapons to be sold in the U.S. That goes for high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
 
Why?

Because I’m tired of burying children. Take it or leave it, I don’t care. But it’s happening.
1599 2018-02-25 07:43:04 Exactly....as per a study more than 70% of investors sell stocks in 1 year...!!
1600 2018-02-25 07:42:33 Maybe for some, though I can't imagine why. But as I've been saying any semiautomatic weapon should not be owned by civilians. Bump stocks should not be sold. It's insanity to hand these out like candy to anyone who wants one.

1624 2018-02-25 07:11:02 AR-15 with bump stock is still a semi-automatic gun. The ban of bump stocks I can get behind, but an AR-15 IS NOT an assault rifle. For a gun to be classified as an assault rifle, it has to be fully-automatic which an AR-15 is not; it is, again, a SEMI-automatic.
1625 2018-02-25 07:11:00 @McConnellsNeck Has the NRA gagged you. You have said nothing about what you plan to do to end the mass murders in this country. We need a ban on bump stocks, AK-15 and large magazine clips.

1638 2018-02-25 06:58:17 Actually they want tighter regulations, ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Increase the age to 21. You always mention taking away your guns, abolishing the 2nd A. Those are your tactics to inflame people. This has not been said. People are more important than guns.
1639 2018-02-25 06:58:01 Stop whining about the investigation and do your job. Ban bump stocks, AK-15, make universal background checks, stop state by state data bases.
1640 2018-02-25 06:54:49 It's not that simple - the ability to choose great fund managers is very different from the ability to choose great stocks, and the latter takes a LOT more time. Index funds, at least in India, don't serve you best at all.

1642 2018-02-25 06:53:51 Of the hundreds of thousands of bumpfire stocks in America, only one of which I am aware has ever been used to commit a crime. That's a really good reason to ban the rest of them. (Read that last sentence with a heavy emphasis on sarcasm.)

1648 2018-02-25 06:48:12 The Stocks that had a quick drop of 16% would be the same ones that had huge gains preceding that. The volatility comes with the territory.

1666 2018-02-25 06:32:49 How about the stocks?
1667 2018-02-25 06:32:36 The stocks are very poor from which a new leader is to be picked,(remember Baaarnby)
The person I believe capable of bringing the Nationals out of the dark ages is remaining clear of the current "killing fields".
Showing political nouse.
1668 2018-02-25 06:32:23 Why is it so hard? No bump stocks, no semi autos, 21+ gun ownership, deep universal checks, no one with mental disorders, I say good start!!
1669 2018-02-25 06:30:47 It can be easily modified to shoot just as fast as a full auto though. The digitrigger and bump-stocks easily do that. However, I get what you’re saying
1670 2018-02-25 06:30:33 How can the NRA ban bump stocks.  The NRA doesn't sell guns, ammo nor bump stocks.  They don't write laws nor can they enforce them.
1671 2018-02-25 06:30:20 Gun company stocks did go higher immediately after the shooting. It’s the protests & companies beginning to abandon the NRA that are negatively impacting their stock, now. I like seeing that downward trend.
1672 2018-02-25 06:30:19 What is your perspective on cryptocurrencies, and also on tech stocks in general like F.A.N.G stocks that are disrupting traditional companies you have previously invested in heavily #AskWarren
1673 2018-02-25 06:26:15 Then why do you let Tony's 3+million friends...

#HousingForEurope 

Has Labour ever replaced that housing stock ?....
1674 2018-02-25 06:26:14 Good. Because it's not about the members. It's about the detestable leaders of the NRA, back-dealing and insulting the public with their bone-throw in doing away with bump stocks. This should have been done long ago.
1675 2018-02-25 06:25:48 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
1676 2018-02-25 06:25:32 NOBODY IS SAYING WE SHOULD BAN GUNS. It’s assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines that should be banned.    NOBODY IS SAYING WE SHOULD BAN GUNS. Get that through your head for God’s sake!
1677 2018-02-25 06:24:59 You know the companys boycotting the NRA stockholders should sell their stocks cause  their value is going to fall big time
1678 2018-02-25 06:23:20 1) Ban assault rifles.  Definition To be negotiated. 
2) Mandatory background checks on ALL gun sales, including black market, cash sales in dark alleys.
3) Ban all illegal imports of guns.
4) Ban bump stocks

What am I missing?  What about handguns?
1679 2018-02-25 06:22:31 are there still stocks of that beret? :<
1680 2018-02-25 06:22:08 Tell us all where in the Constitution that it says bump stocks, assault weapons and large magazines should be available to the public or where it says background checks should be thwarted or where it says the mentally ill should have access to guns like the bill your team passed.
1681 2018-02-25 06:18:39 Sir, avoiding debt looks ok but at the same time we also like to invest in retail focussed banks, housing finance cos..if ppl dnt take debt, what will happen to those businesses n their stocks
1682 2018-02-25 06:17:01 Yes, these are regular stocks. My point is Google does not sell such firearms accessories by policy, except the policy is not enforced.
1683 2018-02-25 06:15:34 I know just growing up selling guns with my Dad, raised in Gun Shows, I'm into music so I have an ear, I could tell it was not full auto, but it was faster than semi-auto, it was in between them both. tat,tat,tat,tat I didn't know about bump stocks
1684 2018-02-25 06:13:13 the NRA to step up and be a public leader for reasonable gun laws. Clean up or replace the NICS, add waiting periods, mandatory training, even support gun ownership licenses (like drivers licenses).  Lets ban the low hanging fruit like bump stocks and trigger cranks, too.  3/4
1685 2018-02-25 06:10:32 TRUMP LIKES TO BRAG ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET BUT THE TOP 10% OWN OVER 80% OF THE STOCKS IN AMERICA SO NO HELP FOR THE POOR OR THE MIDDLE CLASS.#VOTEDEMOCRATIC
1686 2018-02-25 06:10:20 My husband is a NamVet, a fire arm is one thing, but as he puts it, an assault weapon, AR-15, bump stocks - they have no business in the hands of average ppl. Those are military meant to kill weaponary, a basic gun stands no chance against this! Ban these is not messing with 2A
1687 2018-02-25 06:10:06 You need to scroll up, all you have said is how excited you are about your stocks BECAUSE 17 CHILDREN WERE MURDERED. 
No matter how you twist it to justify your profit from mass murder that is all it is. 
I'm done participating in your self-deluded celebration.
1688 2018-02-25 06:10:01 And I think for you Pappu is PM material. Is not it?
1689 2018-02-25 06:09:08 That’s why I’m totally okay banning bump stocks.
1690 2018-02-25 06:08:37 There are many stocks which take time to outperform please look at this stock from a 2 year view and is not s short term call
1691 2018-02-25 06:07:35 The NRA lobbies for easier access to guns, lax gun laws, sued to defeat background checks, worked to block access to gun information, support bump stocks a device which only exist to break laws against automatic weapons. They indirectly lead to these shootings that’s what happens
1692 2018-02-25 06:05:34 You seem, well, a bit thicker than most.  You are going to have to give up your assault rifles, bump stocks and 30 round clips.  Yes, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  Look at how gun regulations changed in 1934.  We had the 2nd amendment then, too.
1693 2018-02-25 06:05:15 To set realistic goals ie you can't ban all guns in America but you can ban selling new assault rifles and bump stocks, starting with to those under 21. Nothing will happen quickly
1694 2018-02-25 06:04:35 That’s a fair catch! I guess it can be done, with specialized equipment, though I wouldn’t say “easily”. FWIW, I’m fine with banning bump stocks.
1695 2018-02-25 06:04:11 Trumps  other interesting   nra blood orgy death KKKult idea - leave AR 15’s locked cocked &  loaded -ready to kill - ( without bump stocks ) on every street corner -  400  a corner(  so good  guys and bad guys all have access ) - send the bill to taxpayers  add it to the debt -
1696 2018-02-25 06:04:11 In what other civilized country is arming schoolteachers even a serious topic of discussion? At least start by banning bump stocks to show the public you are at least a bit serious!!

1698 2018-02-25 06:04:04 Perhaps teachers should get an extra bonus for carry a couple of these, with bump stocks (if that helps!) and a few ninja throwing stars just for dramatic effect. Should solve the problem. All sickos would think twice ... wouldn’t they?
1699 2018-02-25 06:03:01 Senator you need to research your facts on bump stocks. They are for entertainment only.They make the AR15 very inaccurate passed a 100 yards or so distance.The LasVegas shooting the distance was like 500 yards across the street and dowward.  The AR15 effective range was exceeded

1702 2018-02-25 06:00:25 Surprisingly, Trump is the first GOP POTUS going against the NRA stance. They aren’t supporting age changes, background check changes or outlawing bump stocks.

1705 2018-02-25 05:57:29 Senator, you are demonizing a piece of sporting equipment which is not to blame for the LasVegas shooting.     You need to blame the shooting on something and a plastic stock is an easy target. What about the thousands of these stocks on the market and being used by sportsman now
1706 2018-02-25 05:56:47 What you’re failing to completely miss is the fact that the NRA is directly responsible for effectively holding MANY GOP politicians votes hostage w/ the campaign purse strings. A prime example is bump stocks. While there was overwhelming support to ban them after October’s Vegas
1707 2018-02-25 05:55:47 Yes I mean shouldn’t have to be scared. What the students are doing is great absolutely and I hope they create change (banning bump stocks) but at the end of the day honestly mass killing of any kid are because America has a people problem more than anything else
1708 2018-02-25 05:55:01 The people not only have the power in numbers but the power in Dollars and stocks.
You stop buying from these companies and you sell their stock they will get the message quickly,loudly and very crystal clear.

1709 2018-02-25 05:54:45 The pace of making songs is faster than expected. I uploaded one song a week to the net, but stocks are increasing. The feeling of advertising new songs is diminishing. The obsession with one song is probably waning.
1710 2018-02-25 05:53:52 I have never shot an AR with a bump stock but I have shot plenty of AR seen an AR shot once with a bump stock in front of me but the guy was military that guy is the dude that taught me bump stocks are stupid and pointless
1711 2018-02-25 05:53:48 “Bump stocks are down! Sell sell sell!”

1715 2018-02-25 05:50:32 Raise age to 21, end bump stocks, better background checks and plan B - increased security at schools, finally end gun free school zones!!!
1716 2018-02-25 05:49:23 As a student Im standing up for my fellow peers as I hate seeing my peers across the country be in fear I want constructive guncontrol not rash gun control I can see banning bump stocks and 60 round ammo drums but I feel with the proper and right restrictions we may be better off
1717 2018-02-25 05:48:55 Why do you dismiss Trump’s unconstitutional calls for more rigid background checks, possibly establishing a minimum age of 21 for ownership, eliminating bump stocks. Doesn’t demonstrate leadership in my playbook. It represents the same tyranny as Democrats.
1718 2018-02-25 05:48:23 Making Swiss cheese. Bump Stocks should be made illegal in the strongest way possible... Legislation passed by Congress.

1720 2018-02-25 05:47:26 That’s a fair point the bump stocks should have never been legal and I can agree 100% with that
1721 2018-02-25 05:46:48 We just want to get em out of the hands of pp. who shouldn't have em. By A making it just a little harder to get (shouldn't effect the good guys) B banning bump stocks & C limiting mag size so it's predictable and gives victims a chance to run or fight back! I'm sure you agree!

1724 2018-02-25 05:45:18 Grasping at straws CNN? The failure is with FBI and sheriff's office. Trump listened to families, will change law on bump stocks, sate reporting of unfit gun owners, up the age. What did BO do? Nothing. Showing DT using notes is sad, he wanted to get the message right. #FakeNews
1725 2018-02-25 05:44:31 The NRA doesn't own any guns.
NRA HAS done wrong by fighting tooth & nail against every common sense legislation that *might* have helped prevent shootings. More prohibited categories in checks. Raise Age limit. Ban bump stocks. Mental health checks. NONE of which are "gun grab".
1726 2018-02-25 05:43:56 Hope we do get through this because kids should have be scared in school and mentally ill people should get the help they need and the law enforcement should do there jobs properly and bump stocks should be banned
1727 2018-02-25 05:43:47 You should buy stocks when they’re on the way up in price, not on the way down. And when you buy more, you do it only after the stock has risen from your purchase price, not after it has fallen below it. - W. Oneil
1728 2018-02-25 05:43:30 bump stocks are not anywhere close to the problem but they are really dumb and tacky.
1729 2018-02-25 05:43:13 I started off by being blown away by Steam and have drifted both ways to lighter and a bit heavier games. Still haven't played a full 18xx. We did the no stocks version of 1830 but that's as close as I've gotten. 

I feel you almost need someone who knows them to teach you once.

1735 2018-02-25 05:37:02 You can sure tell they know nothing about firearms.
The stupid liberals are going after the AR15 because cosmetically it looks scary. There are many semi-automatic hunting rifles that are just or more deadly...Liberals don't see them as dangerous because they have wood stocks.

1739 2018-02-25 05:32:05 stance doesn’t support stricter background checks, banning bump stocks or raising the age limit even tho the GOP & Trump now do. Bump stocks is a perfect example, even tho there was overwhelming support in October, nothing was done bc the NRA pushed to kill the legislation in ‘17
1740 2018-02-25 05:31:27 This is not a secret, and many people have been trying to point that out to the “ban bump stocks” crowd.
1741 2018-02-25 05:30:53 The nra actually thinks bump stocks should be banned and illegal they have said that bump stocks are pointless
1742 2018-02-25 05:29:44 At actually getting things done. Florida is actually taking up legislation that would raise the minimum age of purchase to 21. We are talking about banning bump stocks, that ball got fumbled somewhere along the way. Not to mention that companies are cutting ties left and right.
1743 2018-02-25 05:28:09 Ban both AR-15 & bump stocks And I do own 1 revolver

1746 2018-02-25 05:23:00 The NRA loves to pay off politician's. They also love to prevent any legislation from getting through. 
They also love to mislead. Like them "looking into banning bump stocks". It was all a smokescreen.
1747 2018-02-25 05:21:29 Lets keep an eye on these companies stocks and see how they're doing in a couple of weeks..........
1748 2018-02-25 05:20:26 correct, bullish for the dollar. i am agreeing that the crowded short dollar trade is finally starting to be less crowded, bullish for dollar. it is clear bullish dollar is bad for stocks given short term correlation. in addition, stocks are double topping at res + vix at support

1750 2018-02-25 05:19:39 Leave it to the gun nut to act obtuse. How about: national background checks, national registration, age restrictions nationally, bump stocks banned nationally, caliber and mag sizes restricted nationally. In case you can’t figure out the theme, I’ll help: NATION WIDE.
1751 2018-02-25 05:19:34 It's not just because it's "scary looking" it's that it's heavily modifiable. You can add scopes, barrels, and different magazines to it easy peasy. We also have bump stocks that work well with it too to make it automatic. This picture doesn't tell the full story.
1752 2018-02-25 05:19:29 Need to bring back public ridicule with the stocks again

Suggested new motto for United Airlines:

"Fly United. United we stand;
Bigoted & Divided we crash our stocks...but hopefully not our unarmed planes."
1757 2018-02-25 05:17:19 The President proposed to outlaw bump stocks, raise the minimum age, enhance  background checks and he said arming teachers should be voluntary . Rural and suburban teachers are no strangers to guns.  Every other interest group has lobbyist why single out the NRA?
1758 2018-02-25 05:16:10 Troops in Iraq resurrected thousands of M14's kept in storage since Vietnam and refitted many with M4-type stocks. Their powerful .308 round now gave them superior range and accuracy to enemy AK's, even the power to go through cinder block. The M14 was the true assault rifle.
1759 2018-02-25 05:15:20 So u should know more than ANYONE the detriments we face re: retirement given our only option is to gamble in 401k stocks. Pensions are largely a thing of the past + 2008 shows us how woefully uncertain stock market can be. My generation is first to be poorer than my predecessors
1760 2018-02-25 05:14:37 Yes, I agree. Bump stocks were meant for fun, I think in the beginning. But Las Vegas changed all that. I say ban them. It helps morally.
1761 2018-02-25 05:14:28 pray these stocks come through for a nigga

1765 2018-02-25 05:13:01 Don’t give up, don’t stop talking about this. Everyone, do at least one thing for assault weapons ban ( and all the little killing machine accessories - like bump stocks, etc)  daily whether its giving support tweets, setting up volunteer opportunities, reading articles...
1766 2018-02-25 05:12:45 rather than new costumes, i think they should use the money to produce more stocks of goods. 
1767 2018-02-25 05:12:42 Were there not votes from both sides?  I'm neither a dem nor a rep.  "Unaffiliated" is the official position here in Colorado.  
Banning bump stocks seems to have sufficient backing now, including the President, so we'll see...
1768 2018-02-25 05:10:22 I'm happy for you if you make money. You should buy after you get to know about the sector, supply-demand, price, etc. Not based on some marketer selling metal stocks in his tweets. I don't see any issue with any stock, this is not about any stock at all. It's about bad marketers

1772 2018-02-25 05:07:19 Pls ask the staffs about the stocks. 
1773 2018-02-25 05:06:24 We should ban all semi-automatic rifles, large capacity magazines and bump stocks / cranks.

1775 2018-02-25 05:04:19 He’s just suggesting the most moronic possible solution so people will be OK with a less moronic, less extreme solution that is moderate instead of more severe/effective. Don’t settle for “bump stocks” just because teachers don’t get guns. Get them all.

1777 2018-02-25 05:03:06 @RepMikeCoffman Please reject NRA funds. Instead save lives by working on bipartisan gun •safety*: minimum:  improved background checks; ban bump stocks; stringent requirements for purchasing assault-style weapons. I think most people, including hunters  in CO, agree with this.
1778 2018-02-25 05:02:22 Thats true except when wall street is systematically milking the unregulated crypto markets. Don’t underestimated the power of greedy people in our country. Their greed blinds them of the risks of greater crypto adoption. Bitcoin wasn’t meant to be traded like stocks or “moon.”
1779 2018-02-25 05:02:12 Gladly. The NRA will be happy to disassociate with a leftist controlled airline such as yourselves. Oh, and all those NRA members & millions of Trump supporters can now choose other airlines for their air travel needs. See ya! (United stocks )
1780 2018-02-25 05:01:39 @SenCoryGardner Please work with Senator Bennett on bipartisan gun •safety*: minimum: improved background checks; ban bump stocks; stringent requirements for purchasing assault-style weapons. I think most people, including hunters in CO, agree with this.

1782 2018-02-25 04:59:23 @FIN85_   Happy b day man 
1783 2018-02-25 04:57:42 be more angry that children are dead and are continuing to die. Are your stocks more important 2 you than children's lives?
1784 2018-02-25 04:57:07 Start with
- Universal background checks & gun registry
- Safety testing for lic.
- Standards for securing guns
- Ban bump stocks
1785 2018-02-25 04:54:29 The NRA fully supports making bump stocks illegal.
1786 2018-02-25 04:54:12 You do understand that you are part of that bullshit, right? We all are. I don’t like some of their decisions (bump stocks) and there are other organizations out there fighting for us. NRA are not the cause of any of this.
1787 2018-02-25 04:53:20 Is there anyone who still favors bump stocks?  It doesn't take much to read the existing machine gun ban (around for decades) to include a bump stock.
1788 2018-02-25 04:52:39 Let them carry on then, without these conscientious companies. As long as they do not support common sense gun laws, strong background checks and want to put bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons into people's hands - then they can go sit on an AR-15. #BoycottTheNRA
1789 2018-02-25 04:52:25 Sureness ate!  sana lang ilabas na nila lahat ng stocks nila na magaganda. Huhuhaha!
1790 2018-02-25 04:51:33 My thing is, they have already banned bump stocks. AR is the same caliber as a hunting rifle, pretty soon it will go to ban handguns, watch. I’m all for better laws that prevents things like this, but where does it stop? Where we start infringing on peoples rights.
1791 2018-02-25 04:50:56 I’m calling my financial planner first thing Monday morning to be sure I don’t own any stock in @united. Its stock is going plummet from the friendly skies. So will stocks of other foolish companies. #NRA #2A #BoycottUnitedAirlines #BoycottDeltaAirlines #BoycottEnterprise
1792 2018-02-25 04:50:31 Bump stocks- and pin filing are still realities though.

1808 2018-02-25 04:44:42 which one? Bump stocks are neither firearms nor a “part or component necessary to the function of a gun”
1809 2018-02-25 04:43:52 He tried to do that with me last night. He picked a bunch of guns that had the same action/caliber, but two were wood stocks. Basic is as basic does.
1810 2018-02-25 04:42:49 Don't know why you have such a harsh opinion just because I present another view. I'm not "liberial". Trump's change were the easy ones: bump stocks and a proposed age change. It all has to go thru Congress, he can't just decree this, no changes are made.
1811 2018-02-25 04:42:45 What about binary triggers, arm brace stocks, & tannerite? Some of which come with stimiliar letters provided by the ATF much like bump stocks.

1813 2018-02-25 04:41:09 @StockingKingNam I've been reading through your stock education and I am learning alot, but I would love to get some info on how you find or scan for the stocks you trade. What websites, software, any details of the scans, etc would help. Thanks for all that you do!
1814 2018-02-25 04:41:01 Universal background checks for every gun purchase. Bans on bump stocks, high capacity magazines (more than 10 rounds), and bans on semi-automatic rifles. Bans on anyone with a history of domestic violence owning a firearm.
1815 2018-02-25 04:40:39 You do realize Obama’s ATF approved “Bump-stocks” I don’t think the @NRA wanted them or cares for them.

1819 2018-02-25 04:38:09 @NRA I'm disappointed in many ways with the NRA's stance, you're no longer trying to protect our 2nd amendment.  Bump stocks, age requirements, and background checks are a you pandering to the leftist media.   Grow some balls.
1820 2018-02-25 04:37:41 I see bump stocks at work all the time, it’s clearly a loophole for the law against fully automatics.
1821 2018-02-25 04:37:38 6) no access to those on the terrorist watch list
7) no bump stocks
1822 2018-02-25 04:37:36 Do all those other rifles accept 30, 60, and 90-round magazines? Are they compact enough to conceal more easily? Do they come equipped with shoulder stocks that can be easily removed in order to fit the rifle with a bump-stock device to simulate full-auto fire? No, no and no....
1823 2018-02-25 04:36:58 Interesting you say it was about mental health Yada Yada Yada. It's about the AR15's, bump stocks and more. It's about lobbyist, campaign $, about so much more...none of which you addressed in the letter. Nice try @NRA @waynelapierrejr
1824 2018-02-25 04:35:35 Most of your followers are HODLers including me, but the difference is I believe $BTC should be just a reasonable % of your portfolio. Stocks, real estate, physical gold bars&more importantly cash. Yes that fiat everyone is so afraid of on here that buys all assets including BTC.
1825 2018-02-25 04:34:50 It wasn't Law Enforcement selling guns, Bump stocks, endless streams of Mags & Bullets, Shooting schools,.    Some people are not equipped to handle mental stress & allow access to more guns isn't the best answer you can come up with!
1826 2018-02-25 04:33:04 ??? So he just used bump stocks for fun?  Efficient use of ammo was not his mission.  It was to kill and wound as many as possible.
1827 2018-02-25 04:32:31 Y’all gotta ban them bump stocks merica
1828 2018-02-25 04:32:18 Background checks would not have stopped Stephen Pollack. he had zero signs that he was nuts. Republicans said after Las Vegas they would do something about bump stocks. Nothing happened.
1829 2018-02-25 04:31:26 Congress can't even agree on bump stocks. They will debate this until we are all cold in our graves.
1830 2018-02-25 04:30:21 I agree about bump stocks, but you know you can use a belt to achieve the same effect. Can't ban belts. If someone is determined they will find a way.
1831 2018-02-25 04:30:13 And most gun owners, and everyone I'VE spoken to, support a ban on bump stocks. useless. Absolutely ZERO practical use for it, range or anything. Ban it.
1832 2018-02-25 04:29:34 I have zero faith in your president to do anything that benefits humanity given his total lack of empathy. Bump stocks should absolutely not be available for civilians.
1833 2018-02-25 04:29:34 @POTUS begging you-stand firm-people kill-NOT guns- take the bump stocks- leave the ARs alone!
1834 2018-02-25 04:29:30 Remember military spending accounts for between 60%-70% of every dollar the US Govt takes in, thats not education, health care, social programs etc...so you really need to ditch those stocks, cut military spending & invest in the people of USA. Good luck.
1835 2018-02-25 04:28:26 One of the arguments I’ve heard against banning bump stocks is that they could easily be replicated by an amateur. But looking at the operation, it seems like a DIY bump stock wouldn’t be nearly as smooth, or precise as a professionally engineered one.
1836 2018-02-25 04:28:06 Bump stocks are trash anyways.
1837 2018-02-25 04:27:52 Weird that they've been able to get several large brands to break off support with the NRA, forced Florida to consider raising purchasing age and get a ban on bump stocks. What have you done, wise Blake? lol
1838 2018-02-25 04:25:45 Ya same. The political figures here just argue back and forth like children. Hopefully trumps plan to limit access raise age and illegalize bump stocks gets done. Good start at least
1839 2018-02-25 04:25:18 Hey @GoogleShoppingS what gives here? Have you guys transitioned from “don’t be evil “ to “anything for a buck” so easily? Stop selling these bump stocks please!
1840 2018-02-25 04:24:59 Now imagine if you put armor piercing ammo and a silencer in that package. Imagine. And let us not forget bump stocks....a serious death machine. Already in many homes.
1841 2018-02-25 04:24:25 With all of that on record, how come he could still legally buy an AR-15? These reasons listed is WHY The President is pushing for more extensive comprehensive background checks, focusing on mental health, raising the age to 21 & ending the sale of bump stocks. & Is great he (1)
1842 2018-02-25 04:23:59 Why is @POTUS  for banning bump stocks. Letting 
ATF even consider banning semi autos? 
I voted for @POTUS  
I don’t find in 2A where it says or if but and however
Anything that stops Citizens from having any type of
Gun. Govt now seems intent on shrinking our Rights
1843 2018-02-25 04:23:42 58 people were killed by that psycho in Las Vegas and almost a thousand injured. We talked about bump stocks for a week and moved on, I guess Trump said something dumb so we had to focus on that or whatever.
1844 2018-02-25 04:22:42 I mill in marijuana stocks .2seconds lol
1845 2018-02-25 04:22:39 No, that would be you !! Bet you forgot what you promised about eliminating bump stocks already... you want to fix DACA ? do it by executive order the same way you killed it ! Phony ! Liar ! King  of dementia !
1846 2018-02-25 04:20:58 Sir everyone says pick right stocks.. also pls guide how to identify those few from thousands available in the market..
1847 2018-02-25 04:20:43 I didn't know most of the manga nominations but I'm so, completely unsurprised that the Lesbian Experience one took home the gold. Called that so hard I got the urge to go buy some stocks now.

1849 2018-02-25 04:18:12 iphone 7 32gb new stocks coming 
1850 2018-02-25 04:16:22 Sir, with all respect, raising rifle purchase age and banning gun stocks makes no sense, since neither age nor bump stocks are factors in crimes. #2A
1851 2018-02-25 04:14:26 The Youth plan is dependent on the year of birth as you're 24. So you're still eligible. All stocks for handsets are while stocks last. So do head down to our stores to take up your preferred handset soon. -AL
1852 2018-02-25 04:13:14 Good guys can get guns. They don't need AR-15s. They don't need to kill 17 bad guys all by themselves. Restrict high capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks. Better background checks. Mandatory reporting of gun theft. Red flag laws to temporarily seize guns based on tips.
1853 2018-02-25 04:06:47 A pressure point is go to corp website  to "investor relations" Point out permanent Brand damage from a soured young generation. Lost profits = decrease in value of stocks. Bettter chance of getting their attention. Complain to Board. Yes use UPSorUSPS to ship. Sell FedEx stock?
1854 2018-02-25 04:06:45 @realDonaldTrump together with the @NRA will find ways to make us safer (bump stocks, 80% receivers, background..) Maybe it's time for limited "Free Supporters Membership"-no discounts just support of the 2A. Not all patriots own firearms. Great midterm boost all around #MAGA
1855 2018-02-25 04:05:45 The stocks are dropping marginally while gun sales,  and gun accessories sales are skyrocketing....  Yep.   This makes sense.
1856 2018-02-25 04:04:56 @tiaa @vanguard Please list your products that own stocks in manufacturers and dealers of semi-automatic weapons and ammunition sold to the public.
1857 2018-02-25 04:04:47 Inspite of become fearer,Become cautious.Stay away from overvalued big stocks.keep patience&watch&wait for right opportunity to invest
1858 2018-02-25 04:04:41 Tired of hearing about the Muller investigation.

No matter how much good they don’t want anything positive said
1859 2018-02-25 04:03:57 “Bump stocks” provide an effective workaround to convert our anger out on the people is incredible.
1860 2018-02-25 04:03:52 1st, I disagree with your premise, "most", & from your list, you want everything banned but handguns, which can also be semi autos, shotguns, & bolt action rifles? I agree with banning bump stocks. Did you know handguns are most used in mass shootings?
1861 2018-02-25 04:03:38 They are doing the grift.  It reminds me of pumping stocks so others will buy.

1864 2018-02-25 04:01:34 Hahaha this Jake guy’s a fucking idiot, lmao. Check out his profile & particularly his tweet about banning bump stocks. Maybe he needs to stay off the weed once in a while so he can form logical and coherent arguments 
1865 2018-02-25 04:01:33 Currently 
1866 2018-02-25 04:00:16 Corollary - US Govt or Fed should buy stocks or get other CBs to buy US stocks. SNB? JCB next.

1868 2018-02-25 03:59:08 There are several versions of the AR-15 specially made for hunting and/or target shooting purposes. The pictures shown and models that seem to be used in shooting incidents are the M4 style 16” barrel with collapsible stocks etc.There are several diff uppers and lowers for an AR.
1869 2018-02-25 03:58:04 War is big business, there will be many unhappy financiers out there. Stocks will fall
1870 2018-02-25 03:56:18 Hey. Can you say, 'bye-bye bump stocks'? It's fun, try it. Say it three times fast
1871 2018-02-25 03:56:12 Thank you for announcing that to a much broader population of ppl .@AP.  It will reach many more @NRA #NRA members, thereby allowing Delta to realize just how large NRA is.  Can you say “stocks will go down.”?
1872 2018-02-25 03:55:10 Bump stocks don't automatically make a rifle automatic, they can increase the rate of fire but they are hard to use as your trying to use the gun recoil to bounce it between your shoulder and the trigger.and more often lead to jamming of the gun.
1873 2018-02-25 03:55:04 Any body in the #yeg twitterverse know of a #tile shop in #Edmonton that stocks or can easily supply #Mexican talavera tile?

1875 2018-02-25 03:54:46 let’s see , the president poke about better background checks, bump stocks , mental illness yeah your right nothing els hahaha

1877 2018-02-25 03:53:37 Looking to buy stocks... 
1878 2018-02-25 03:53:02 Lies!
1879 2018-02-25 03:53:01 Yep, I realize that.  I also realize most drive cars to work rather than riding horses.  I also don’t need to drive a tank to work.  I don’t think we need semi automatics, bump stocks, or large magazines. I’ll hope for discussion among reps about what we can do to make us better.
1880 2018-02-25 03:51:16 Driving a car is a privilege, owning a gun is a constitutional right. That’s what makes us different from the rest of the industrialize world. Funny how you’ve decided to ban the media buzz words. Assault rifle and bump stocks. The hard part, how does one define assault rifle?
1881 2018-02-25 03:50:45 Need to get back into them stocks

1886 2018-02-25 03:46:44 I would call that a minor plan... the emphasis on minor details. Outlawing bump stocks is half hearted... there are other methods to convert an AR-15 to fully automatic...
1887 2018-02-25 03:44:09 That's actually false 

At least not without attachments 
Which are illegal 

Yet similar attachments for AR's like bump stocks are totally legal
1888 2018-02-25 03:43:11 @TheAngrySooner @Cody6652 Look at this D-Bag!???  Gets butt hurt Bc he feels like a huge pile of dumbass so he stocks her page.... then in a week will slide into her DMs....
1889 2018-02-25 03:43:04 UNITED FELLOWSHIP stocks slump
1890 2018-02-25 03:43:02 Id bet against all MJ stocks right now as we inch closer to legalization.
1891 2018-02-25 03:42:50 Bump. Stocks. Have you already forgotten about the deadliest mass shooting in American history?
1892 2018-02-25 03:42:11 If you can vote and enlist in the Military, you should be able to buy a gun to defend yourself. Banning bump stocks is an exercise in futility, it only takes practice to learn how to pull the trigger quickly and with more accuracy. It’s a token gesture.

1894 2018-02-25 03:41:21 They don’t want to be armed..
But let’s talk about stronger back ground check bump stocks AR 15’s and muller investigation Russia sanctions you should have placed on them already what’s the hold up?
1895 2018-02-25 03:40:21 Hahaha you lot really are on another planet, so its still a dive even tho their manager and player both said it was a pen  Liverpool fans starting to become bigger laughing stocks than Arsenal 
1896 2018-02-25 03:40:15 @AntiViGames dude, I wanna get into forex :/ I'm killing it in stocks but forex sounds easier. Anyway we can work together?
1897 2018-02-25 03:39:53 So if I said, most rational people are asking for: Elimination of bump stocks; elimination of high capacity magazines; elimination of silencers; elimination of semi-automatic rifles; elimination of armor piercing bullets; better mental health checks; minimum age requirements
1898 2018-02-25 03:39:05 ARs are a type of semi-automatic rifle. There are many other versions. I’m not sure, but assume bump stocks could be used with those also. I’m not that familiar with bump stocks and it looks like they maybe on their way out. We miss you and Kristen. Come visit.
1899 2018-02-25 03:37:55 Any semiauto gun can be fitted easily with a home made bump stock.   There is no reason to buy one when one can be made at home.  Bump stocks are a novelty item nothing else.
1900 2018-02-25 03:37:50 Wait till Monday when their stocks start to crumble, FedEx, Amazon, these are publicly traded company and they care very much about their stocks price
1901 2018-02-25 03:37:26 @justinamash So when are we going to get universal background checks, a ban on bump stocks, and an age limit of 21 to purchase firearms? Polls show that voters on both sides of the spectrum support these measures overwhelmingly.
1902 2018-02-25 03:36:57 Stocks stocks stocks stocks stocks stocks stocks stocks
1903 2018-02-25 03:36:04 Overheard the parking attendant: “I’m just now learning about stocks, but I already know a lot about crypto currencies.” 
1904 2018-02-25 03:35:35 Excuse me, but the teachers WERE defending their students, with their bodies, while the trained men with guns stayed outside. What's my idea ?Limit the size of magazines, outlaw bump stocks (which everyone has been saying but the great orange one will claim was his idea),
1905 2018-02-25 03:35:22 No it’s a cave because they realize that in the big picture of things bump stocks are nothing more than a novelty item and not what you leftist are screaming they are.
1906 2018-02-25 03:34:36 Trying to diversify? Try these cyborgs stocks!
1907 2018-02-25 03:34:34 This is what he said and I quote: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
1908 2018-02-25 03:34:21 The NRA is not about 2nd amendment freedoms, it's all about mega profits for the gun manufacturers and associated businesses. No one NEEDS assault rifles and bump stocks; we can't always have everything we want
1909 2018-02-25 03:33:11 It may not stop school shootings but the Vegas shooter used bump stocks to modify his guns so it may have the potential to limit the damage people can do in future attacks.
1910 2018-02-25 03:32:18 I might concede on background checks or bump stocks but none of this will happen because you decided you’d rather be a grammar troll than an adult. (2/2)
1911 2018-02-25 03:32:04 A 90 day ban on logging is a blinder. Well connected loggers will still harvest. Or can one be banned from exploiting that he or she has already bought and paid for? Also, some have log stocks that can outlast 3 months.
1912 2018-02-25 03:31:52 I support the 2A. I also think too many ppl in Govt have dropped the ball lately, letting crazy ppl obtain weapons. I think loopholes should be closed & bump stocks/other devices sb banned. We need mental health facilities bc parents don’t know where to go w/violent sons!
1913 2018-02-25 03:30:18 “...because he is not a politician, Trump appears to actually b looking for real solutions to country’s school shooting contagion, including modest gun control proposals-a ban on bump stocks-raising legal age to 21 for purchase certain firearms-arming qualified school personnel”
1914 2018-02-25 03:29:56 Actually padeliver ta ko wings sa alberto's pero unavailable :( ugma pa daw ata arrive stocks from cebu
1915 2018-02-25 03:29:06 Working in law enforcement, I see illegal guns daily. And illegally used. Or just illegally carried. Like the Drug War, banning big clips or bump stocks or anything modified or otherwise doesn't stop it. I think we can be smarter. I truly have no big unifying answer.
1916 2018-02-25 03:28:36 We know 2 stocks going up on Monday. $SPY $TBT $QQQ $DIA
1917 2018-02-25 03:26:34 The three laws from the @POTUS for consideration by the lawmakers are raising gun purchasing to 21, Mental Health background checks and Banning bump stocks. Both sets of lawmakers have been against reasonable legislation. The NRA was the one who pushed the Machine Gun Ban.
1918 2018-02-25 03:26:31 Australia banned semi-automatic rifles (pistols were already restricted). Weapons capable of rapid single shot fire and easily modified to be automatic (e.g. via “bump stocks” or replacing/modding a couple of parts) are not needed for “hunting”.
1919 2018-02-25 03:25:59 Why didn’t you end the sale of bump stocks after the massacre in Las Vegas?
1920 2018-02-25 03:25:51 I agree on some gun “control” issues I don’t see the need in the big magazines & bump stocks and of course as before some ppl should not any kind of a gun But “normal” ppl should be able to buy a gun of their choice
1921 2018-02-25 03:25:39 Annie wants the government to protect her. Disarm Americans. Did that work in Florida? U blame bump stocks u blame the NRA u even blame the gun. Did u blame the truck, plane, utility knife, bomb, baby, car, did u call for the ban? I'd bet my life u believe in slaughtering babies
1922 2018-02-25 03:24:45 Pre-EU the UK allowed fishing stocks to dwindle away. So, you should add that industry to the list above. There'll  be a boom in pawn shops and mental health services though.
1923 2018-02-25 03:24:03 Of course but the donkeys of dg and elk don't get stocks
1924 2018-02-25 03:23:53 The idiots who scream about bump stocks are clueless and have no idea that any idiot can make a functional bumpstock in small amount of time.   Bump stocks don’t make fun more deadly it makes it highly inaccurate
1925 2018-02-25 03:23:22 2010. Obama allowed bump stocks. Try and twist it..
1926 2018-02-25 03:21:28 The principle at issue described as gun control is not backgound checks, assault weapons, bump stocks or waiting periods. The concern is the disarmng of the citizen. The citizen cannot be helpless if those in or with power make unacceptable intrustions into home or private life.
1927 2018-02-25 03:20:41 Why not sideways? Just noise until stocks likely dive
1928 2018-02-25 03:19:25 yeah, poor hillbillies have no money to own stocks - they spend it on AnnCoulters books :)
1929 2018-02-25 03:19:16 my aunts and uncles really having a “crypto” meeting to discuss which stocks they should invest in, OC viet fam at their finest 
1930 2018-02-25 03:17:54 So semi autos can be rifles pistols or shotguns.  Now given that the AWB idiotic (it targeted guns with pistol grips and adjustable stocks).  So this whole "weapons of war" rhetoric is entirely innefective and doesn't really get us anywhere to effective legislation...
1931 2018-02-25 03:16:51 I'm still true to my word. Can't argue that I've used other services that some rich guy in those two companies have stocks in or whatever. Can't keep track of that shit honestly. All I know is what I claim is true
1932 2018-02-25 03:15:44 Dude. I already know how much money you’ve made in “stocks” this month, so stop with the AWESOME CUTS OF BEEF!!! 
1933 2018-02-25 03:15:36 NRA is run w/blood money! Every single day the NRA supports semi automatics, bump stocks, not raising minimum age or tightening background checks-means any gun related killing is in part fault of NRA!
1934 2018-02-25 03:15:01 He said NOTHING ABOUT arming teachers in this tweet. He said remove bump stocks. Raise age to 21 and you pull out an item that was brought up during a round table DISCUSSION that apparently isn't being acted upon. But it's DT so....HITLER IS TRYING TO KILL US ALLLLLLL!
1935 2018-02-25 03:14:42 No one I know wants to ban all guns, it's the assault weapons that can shoot rapidly or be easily modified to do so (bump stocks). We want common sense gun laws, for everyone's sake.
1936 2018-02-25 03:13:03 UNITED FELLOWSHIP stocks rallying
1937 2018-02-25 03:12:53 Lol guys. Like Anthony says rockstar in one and rock bottom due to crap stocks 
1938 2018-02-25 03:12:53 So is inflation.  It hurts every time I grocery shop.  Can I shop with stocks?  Hmmm.
1939 2018-02-25 03:12:35 Agreed on the militia. At the time this was conceived, it was needed to throw off an abusive, out-of-control government. No need for assault rifles, bump stocks, and arming crazy people or young children.
1940 2018-02-25 03:11:36 So glad I learned about stocks and trading currencies now I can use that money for my kids college/life fund

1942 2018-02-25 03:10:25 Not really. It's already widely accepted that bump stocks should be banned, as is the general idea that one should be above 21 to purchase a gun.
1943 2018-02-25 03:10:18 So, if certain clips, stocks, rifles, etc. do get banned.
Would you still be a responsible, law-abiding gun owner and turn them in, or would you decide to break the law?
1944 2018-02-25 03:10:04 Anyone trading stocks or cryptocurrency give me a follow! I follow back
1945 2018-02-25 03:09:04 How can you raise the age to 21 when military and voting is 18?  Bump stocks yes, waiting period yes, better background checks yes.  Veterans guarding our children, yes!
1946 2018-02-25 03:08:30 Bump stocks and a comprehensive background checks don’t impede on the 2nd. Sometimes, Presidents have to look into the eyes of tragedy and what makes sense.
1947 2018-02-25 03:07:41 So as I do agree that background checks need to be stricter and mental health examinations need to be legitimate, I don’t think you should have to wait for a gun (unless you order it) or be restricted from semiautomatic weapons. I’m also fine with banning bump stocks because they
1948 2018-02-25 03:06:12 Modi is the messenger of black money. He arranged all situations including the replacement of RBI governor to help Modi's masters for money laundering through stocks. Laundered huge amount recently. @OfficeOfRG, @cpimspeak, @MamataOfficial, @PMOIndia, @SrBachchan, @INCIndia,
1949 2018-02-25 03:06:07 I'll agree on the bump stocks. You do realize that what you're calling a "military style weapon" has never been used by our military? It's not "automatic", it's nothing more than a rifle that LOOKS mean. Handguns do the same thing, as do many modern hunting rifles.
1950 2018-02-25 03:06:02 no, my musing started with wondering how this is good business to split and offend ur customer base - 

what i am asking now is  - what age? is that to use or to own or to buy?

bump stocks non issue -
1951 2018-02-25 03:05:57 Well I say FBI dropped the ball. Officers should’ve went in when they heard shots. Raise the purchase age, remove bump stocks, and increase security machines throughout schools and that’s about it. I just disagree with teachers and weapons.
1952 2018-02-25 03:05:38 He's also advocating that investors divest themselves of certain mutual funds that own gunmaker stocks. What a punk.
1953 2018-02-25 03:05:15 owning a broad basket of stocks and holding them for a long time is a better investment approach than a rapid-trading strategy or investing in high-fee investment products run by Wall Street pros that charge fees and whose job it is to "help" investors.
1954 2018-02-25 03:05:07 18 years old and gun safety class ,no permits here though 
Suppress are always sold out for some reason, useless as bump stocks if you asked me
1955 2018-02-25 03:04:30 Yet it was Obama that approved bumper stocks and its was the NRA that said ‘yeah slow down this needs more research’

And you said what? 

Don’t you have another credit card to peddle to poor minority’s
1956 2018-02-25 03:04:07 pushing to ban high capacity magazines and things like bump stocks is using kids?  I guarantee I own more weapons than most people reading this, but none have high capacity mags or war modifications. My dad was life long NRA member and taught me well.
1957 2018-02-25 03:03:44 It’s ironic that you don’t see how poorly your propaganda plays to the majority of the country, and how it’s accelerating the decline of your toxic and lethal influence on American politics. #2a fans don’t want AR-15s, bump stocks, dead kids or you. 
1958 2018-02-25 03:03:17 You 401k also probably has landfill, oil, gas, marcellus shale, alcohol, gambling and Satan worshipper stocks too. Stop being #stupid.

1960 2018-02-25 03:01:37 That may be an investors perception and will probably cause a SP increase for sure.
I don't trade stocks in general: buy early into the best and hang on for the ride.
;D
1961 2018-02-25 02:59:06 We can keep them safer by getting rid of assault rifles from the hands of the general public. Outlaw Bump stocks now.
1962 2018-02-25 02:58:13 The NRA have been buying politicians to NOT pass common sense gun control like expanding background checks, banning bump stocks, increasing the legal buying age to 21 , etc. They are for protecting guns, not people....
1963 2018-02-25 02:57:37 You're delusional, the Congress will barely be able to ban bump stocks
1964 2018-02-25 02:57:26 Raise WHAT age to twenty one UTTERBULLSHIT @realDonaldTrump , Sir. Bump stocks!!! YOU CAN FIRE JUST AS FAST AND MOREMORE MORE ACCURATELY WITHOUT THEM!!!!
1965 2018-02-25 02:57:24 People are being needlessly slaughtered all so you can have fun target shooting. You don't have the right to an arsenal, so we need to ban the the most extreme guns, mags, bump stocks, etc.
1966 2018-02-25 02:56:56 Never heard of bump stocks before Vegas, either, and woulda said they are useless against anything smaller than a crowded parking lot.  Then a psycho comes along with exactly that in mind....
1967 2018-02-25 02:56:11 Free orphan stocks are in pick a father.
1968 2018-02-25 02:55:38 Most Americans don't like to short solid companies when the chart is broken. To me, it's more reliable than over-shorted stocks of terribly managed companies.
1969 2018-02-25 02:55:22 Just watch what happens when funds start selling stocks of makers and sellers of assault weapons.  That will really hit them in the wallet.

1971 2018-02-25 02:54:34 How come Obama didn't do anything about bump stocks, guns or DACA for that matter. The first two years of his presidency he had The House and 60 votes in the Senate. You want to blame somebody blame Obama.
Let's talk about 650,000 who are killed every year because of abortion....
1972 2018-02-25 02:54:33 Bump stocks should NEVER have been on the market in the first place-we are a gun to tin’ family; our Grandson and his Dad are marksmen and Grandson says he can outfire a bump stock by hand!
1973 2018-02-25 02:54:05 How come Obama didn't do anything about bump stocks, guns or DACA for that matter. The first two years of his presidency he had The House and 60 votes in the Senate. You want to blame somebody blame Obama...
Let's talk about 650,000 who are killed every year because of abortion.
1974 2018-02-25 02:53:51 Reasonable people can differ on where to draw the line on legal guns vs illegal. Now the line is "full auto". But with modern guns that can fire 30 military grade rounds as fast as you can pull a trigger... That line is shifting. Maybe limiting high cap magazines & bump stocks?
1975 2018-02-25 02:53:41 How come Obama didn't do anything about bump stocks, guns or DACA for that matter. The first 2 years of his presidency he had The House and 60 votes in the Senate. You want to blame somebody blame Obama.
Let's talk about 650,000 who are killed every year because of abortion.
1976 2018-02-25 02:53:07 Sadly, it was.  The killer fired into a thick crowd randomly from a distance.

I've heard it said that his using bump stocks actually caused fewer casualties because he couldn't actually aim as the crowd dispersed (though I obviously won't venture an opinion on that part).
1977 2018-02-25 02:53:06 not a member - neither support or oppose - bump stocks don't care

what age?  is that to own or to use?

don't know what nra is for or against - - i don't think they oppose all the things u say - - - 

those were questions - - -

1983 2018-02-25 02:50:15 Yeah handguns and rifles for normal people are fine.  The video game blaming comes up when people start talking about not selling bump stocks and other stupid shit like that.
1984 2018-02-25 02:49:56 What if youre debating on playing with stocks and then the market crashes on you right after you went for it and you lose all your money...
1985 2018-02-25 02:49:00 I'm not DNC. I own guns and support the 2A--I just do not think 2A is sacred. I'm also a Social Democrat, and I actually do have your interests at heart (even if you own large amounts of gun and ammo stocks--you should divest).
1986 2018-02-25 02:48:22 Raise the age for buying guns - across the board. Close the loopholes for background checks - online and at gun shows with a cross platform, pervasive system. Any past violence is a no go. Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks. That’s my initial 1/

2001 2018-02-25 02:42:20 I think you have to do for it all, but people want to invest in crypto ...just like stocks but have no desire to be an analyst, or trader but need help, without paying huge fees buying blind,
2002 2018-02-25 02:41:53 NRA defectors Watch your stocks act like rocks and sink baby.
2003 2018-02-25 02:41:35 agree could help. Especially if you raise the age for ones that come with all the bells and whistles. I got a sks just with extended mags that's it. Could get folding stock all that good stuff. But I always like the original wood stocks.  that idea could slow down such tragedies.
2004 2018-02-25 02:41:23 I prefer high dividend REITs and stocks in my keeper investments. Hate the fees of mutual funds.
2005 2018-02-25 02:40:29 Bump stocks do the trick. I don’t think anyone would care if it’s technically fully automatic if they’re being shot at. Regardless, if someone needs these for protection, they need to contact the police cuz they’ve got bigger issues than just getting robbed. Hard core problems.
2006 2018-02-25 02:40:27 And horrible for the people. 98% of the country want universal background checks. The  majority want an assault weapons ban. The NRA has hijacked our legislative branch. To the point that they couldn't even pass a ban on bump stocks after Las Vegas. 

That's how.

2009 2018-02-25 02:38:32 @blackrock @Vanguard_Group you can change history by getting rid of your investment in gun stocks and removing them from all managed and index funds.  Choose our children over profits.  Who is gonna lead? #NoMoreGuns
2010 2018-02-25 02:37:39 I think the inflation will be measured and fuel Growth Stocks in the future. Gold will do well as all currencies will be devalued to keep debt in check. Gold will be like cash that keeps up but Growth Stocks will shine
2011 2018-02-25 02:37:18 I’m not a fan of bump stocks, but leave them alone. I don’t want a trend started.
2012 2018-02-25 02:36:53 Agreed. Problem with a gun having a bump stocks is that in a mass shooting instance, the shooter doesn't aim, he points and shoots. If we could eliminate them, it would go along way.
2013 2018-02-25 02:34:38 You’re being willfully stupid. Change the definition to include all semi automatic rifles with fixed or removable magazines over 5 rounds capacity. No loopholes for featureless. Ban bump stocks, untraceable 80% receivers and other loophole non-rifle, non-shotgun “firearms” too.
2014 2018-02-25 02:34:11 I'm working on some Lagunitas, Hop Stoopid right now. Good stuff.
2015 2018-02-25 02:33:22 Yeah ask her about all the MA and V (Mastercard & Visa) stock she has. She got in real cheap before some new laws went into effect that greatly benefited MA & V those stocks have rocked. Now if I ACT on that kind of info its insider trading.
2016 2018-02-25 02:32:49 Paying attention to the direction of the overall market is important, but some stocks are strong enough to rise during a correction.
2017 2018-02-25 02:30:05 I don't think you could fit one on the rifle shown. Bump stocks, to me, are useless and hard to use accurately even for experienced shooters. I would never waste the money on one.

2020 2018-02-25 02:29:30 Generally speaking, you can't buy stocks w/ CCs either, so I don't see why anyone has an issue with this or perceives it as a conspiracy.  If they start prohibiting the transfer of funds to exchanges as they have done in some other countries, then we can have the conspiracy chat.

2022 2018-02-25 02:26:27 Your right, there is a perception factor between the Ruger and the AR.  I don't know that much about the Ruger, can it be retrofitted like the AR with bump stocks? I guess what concerns me is when these guns are manipulated to behave like an automatic through loopholes

2024 2018-02-25 02:25:36 If you served, then you'd know that there is no such thing as an assault rifle. It's a name made up by nazis. You are a liar, and likely a bot. Watch the stocks closely of companies that boycott the NRA. No more bailouts this time.
2025 2018-02-25 02:24:33 Yeah, there's been so many bump stocks used........ makes no sense!
2026 2018-02-25 02:23:27 A poem should be uncapped and defenseless
As a funded transmitter,

Midterm
As gold-plated tycoons to the negligence,

Fearless as the protracted flashing
Of trial oxygens where the stocks has terrified--

A poem should be worthless
As the despotism of tendencies.
2027 2018-02-25 02:23:15 I’m encouraged to see you defend right to own guns in line with our 2nd Amendment. Certainly not what many on the left want. I support thorough vetting, no loopholes, no bump stocks or any hardware that convert rifles into auto assault weapons. Now you can shoot with my militia..
2028 2018-02-25 02:22:25 Delta...blowing it today. Expect their stocks to tumble on Monday
2029 2018-02-25 02:22:21 Thank you for noticing the format and bringing it up .. Wondering why it was noticed .. all my crypto tweets will be in this format to distinguish from penny stocks whether anyone likes it or not ..
2030 2018-02-25 02:22:02 All I remember is the dark days of no one tweeting and the ones that were switching to forex and stocks. Thought crypto had died. Otherwise it’s the same shit but more of it
2031 2018-02-25 02:21:47 @Sparrowmemos and I single-handedly cleared out Amazon's sitting up dazai stocks
2032 2018-02-25 02:20:48 Hi, until stocks lasts po 
2033 2018-02-25 02:20:24 Now is the time to invest in our favorite firearms companies! Support freedom and liberty! Buy stocks or a gun today! @NRA @GLOCKInc @RemingtonArms @MossbergCorp @SavageArms #ProGun #Freedom #GunSafety #GunNuts #Liberty
2034 2018-02-25 02:19:54 @t3vor In corrective periods investors always move away from economically sensitive cyclical stocks and into Defensive. But not this time
2035 2018-02-25 02:17:56 "There is no reason why soldiers use pistol grips instead of more traditional stocks"
2036 2018-02-25 02:17:49 Going down!! Check the stocks on these businesses on Monday!!
2037 2018-02-25 02:17:11 Congratulations to Keighley Bennett, Biance Stocks, Dakota Lafferty and Jimmy Layton for making CAC All Conference basketball teams.
2038 2018-02-25 02:17:10 This ban on bump stocks will prevent nothing the fact you don't understand that proves your level of incompetence.
2039 2018-02-25 02:16:46 So @NRA thinks the "individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world" are bump stocks and ARs?
Are we clear? Crystal.
2040 2018-02-25 02:14:09 I will be glad to see your stocks tank.
2041 2018-02-25 02:13:44 Great numbers on Stocks and the FBI and the Pacific throughout the war, one great battle….
2042 2018-02-25 02:13:28 What happened to them pretending after Vegas they'd agree to ban bump stocks ( as if they're law makers)?
2043 2018-02-25 02:12:22 52% of Americans don’t own stocks and 62% either have no access or choose not to participate in employee sponsored 401k scams, so you’re not alone.
2044 2018-02-25 02:12:00 Bump stocks.
2045 2018-02-25 02:11:29 But no, can’t say I’ve shot all types of bump stocks, because they just aren’t very common.  They ruin the accuracy and ease of handling that makes an ar a good weapon
2046 2018-02-25 02:11:28 It happened. Kylie Jenner tweeted about not using snapchat and the stocks dropped over 1B
2047 2018-02-25 02:11:02 Tax reform wasn’t the corporate give away it would have been, he’s looking to introduce paid maternity leave, ban bump stocks for AR’s, raise the age to buy rifles, increase gasoline tax to pay for infrastructure and raised the debt to an all time high....and that’s in one year.
2048 2018-02-25 02:10:16 The word "compromise" indicates they are willing to give something up if we do. I am okay giving up bump stocks in exchange for selective fire.
2049 2018-02-25 02:06:54 It amazes me how dumb the left is... All their anti gun & NRA talk will send gun sales & NRA memberships through the roof. A smart man would start buying stocks in both.
2050 2018-02-25 02:06:11 Boomerang stocks are going up tomorrow.
2051 2018-02-25 02:06:06 To be fair, have you tested an AR with all possible bump stocks, and other legal modifications? What are your expert credentials on this matter? (I'm not being sarcastic, I'm curious)
2052 2018-02-25 02:06:05 That's why every time this happens gun makers stocks go up.. once they start talking about banning something everyone goes out and buys it..
2053 2018-02-25 02:05:26 It’s not just that, it’s quality of materials, parts & barrels. There is no reason for a 30 round clip in civilian world.  Bump stocks make me angry. No matter what, gun free zones is not an answer either today with copycats. National guard for awhile until we figure it out?
2054 2018-02-25 02:04:47 I understand what you are saying Amanda.  But the AR-15 is a wolf in sheeps clothing.  With the right alterations it changed from a semi automatic rifle to an assault rifle.  Make it harder to get.  Raise the age limit.  And get rid of high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
2055 2018-02-25 02:04:38 @MSNBC @CNN @CBSNews Wrong your parents are bad parents if you are using parents as excuses. You sold the guns sorry you are responsible. AR-15, cranks and bump stocks should be band from sales. Putting profit before Americans safety is wrong!
2056 2018-02-25 02:03:22 You're just approaching it the wrong way. For progress to happen in the U.S., the NRA and gun control advocates need to come together and have a civil conversation. Talk about licensing, background checks, age restrictions, and banning the more rare stuff, like bump stocks.
2057 2018-02-25 02:03:19 This was tweeted intentionally, but the past 2 years have taught us, is never trust the media, and the polls for (name your topic) Delta thought they would win MORE support for supporting the Liberal agenda. Delta stocks will plumet monday, and they will post a "misunderstanding"
2058 2018-02-25 02:02:47 #NRA said they were against bump stocks aftr Vegas. Waffled. Left isn't "after" NRA. We want weapons that shoot 10 rounds per second 2 be taken off the sale list. It hasn't been done. @NRA has had decades & not responded. So,hit their pockets. That often works. Weed doesn't kill.
2059 2018-02-25 02:02:06 @anilvohra69 What was your A/D indicator on Friday? Just eyeballing the market, it seemed like breadth was pretty good. Put/calls and many other indicators also suggest still early phases of a rally. I get the sense we now enter a phase where stocks, bonds & gold rally together.
2060 2018-02-25 02:01:07 Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare   nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend   the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest   nation in the world. #2A #MAGA #Liberals #GodBless #Stocks
2061 2018-02-25 02:00:37 Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare   nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend   the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest   nation in the world. #2A #MAGA #Liberals #GodBless #Stocks
2062 2018-02-25 02:00:34 I let my membership lapse because I vehemently disagree with your stance on bump stocks. That being said, I’m signing up for 3 year today just to make liberals shed some tears. Now, represent all of us and not just bolt action hunters.
2063 2018-02-25 02:00:05 You'll need more than a phone #. You'll actually need the majority of their customers to support you. They dont. How did your Keurig boycott turn out? Have you guys had ONE successful boycott yet? Your other boycotts actually INCREASED sales & stocks for the companies
2064 2018-02-25 02:00:02 The NRA has always been against the bump stocks.
2065 2018-02-25 01:59:34 Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare   nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend   the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest   nation in the world. #2A #MAGA #Liberals #GodBless #Stocks
2066 2018-02-25 01:59:01 @realDonaldTrump Your approach to gun control is great Donald, except for the bump stocks.  Dont outlaw them.  Its a first step at eroding more 2a rights.  Whats next?  Clip size?
2067 2018-02-25 01:58:46 I’ve plenty of stocks in my balls so yes, whole night with you sound like a decent plan.
2068 2018-02-25 01:58:33 I think the Bitcoin crash is correlated with what's going on with stocks.
2069 2018-02-25 01:57:22 "It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons..to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk." - Warren Buffett
2070 2018-02-25 01:56:36 Watching the stocks nosedive Monday
2071 2018-02-25 01:56:35 Dammit, now I have to renew my NRA membership.
I was going to let it lapse after they rolled over on bump stocks.
Thanks #gunsense, I imagine many other Americans are in the same boat.
2072 2018-02-25 01:55:52 The @NRA has supported the bannning of bump stocks. The NICS background check system was an @NRA idea and has never worked as effectively as the NRA wanted it to, primarily because of government ineptitude that doesn’t allow it to.
2073 2018-02-25 01:55:47 EU ACABEI DE JOGAR UMA PARTIDA DE SUPER SMASH VALENDO CORRER PELADO EM VOLTA DA CASA. EU GANHEI COM 2 STOCKS KKKKKKKKK
JOGAR COM BÊBADOS É MUITO FÁCIL!
2074 2018-02-25 01:55:12 I’m removing you from my life, and I hope that on Monday, the bottom falls out of your stocks!!
2075 2018-02-25 01:54:52 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!  Donald Trump.  (You we’re saying??)
2076 2018-02-25 01:54:47 On track to make more money in stocks in 4 months than I’ve put into savings in the past 8 months
2077 2018-02-25 01:54:45 How do I ensure that none of the funds in my @Fidelity #401k are invested in the stocks of gun manufacturers?
2078 2018-02-25 01:54:38 My penny stocks have me feeling good right about now
2079 2018-02-25 01:54:36 Thanks for answering. We need to smuggle some of our ARs, bump stocks and extra capacity mags to Canada. Help get numbers higher for their mass shootings; their best was only 17 killed. Smuggling should be easy, no pesky wall and the border is mostly unguarded  
2080 2018-02-25 01:54:32 SDed literally all 3 of my stocks game 3 of dubs sigh
2081 2018-02-25 01:52:33 I would expect you to do nothing else. However, it is more than semantics. It is a fact, the LV killer used several guns, modified with bump stocks. He needed several rifles b/c otherwise the AR's gas tube would melt. I offer my condolences & say good-bye.
2082 2018-02-25 01:50:29 Significant fine ($500) for failure to register within 30 days. 
4. Ban sale or ownership of bump stocks. 
5. Require a 7-10 day waiting period to purchase semi-automatic firearms, silencers, armor piercing ammunition or high capacity magazines
6. Increase age to purchase /2
2083 2018-02-25 01:50:29 12 months in stocks is like 4 months in crypto. I could believe 4 months.
2084 2018-02-25 01:49:53 So low we can buy the stocks of gun manufacturers cheaply.  Thanking you in advance.  

Hey Doc, has anyone explained to you that stock prices and fundamentals can diverge?
2085 2018-02-25 01:49:17 It’s cowardice for the NRA to not admit its wrong to not ban automatic weapons and bump stocks. #BanAssaultRifles
2086 2018-02-25 01:49:10 No place in the world for bump stocks. It is beyond logic why Obama approved them. They are a clear danger to all of us.
2087 2018-02-25 01:48:56 @Delta Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare  nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend  the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest  nation in the world. #2A #MAGA #Liberals #GodBless #Stocks
2088 2018-02-25 01:48:36 Yesterday shouldn't   since sad stocks .
2089 2018-02-25 01:47:51 I would heavily invest in CookOut stocks if they were in the MD vicinity (particularly in the La Plata and Westminster areas.).
2090 2018-02-25 01:46:57 Not really. It uses the perpetual motion for trigger pull. Go watch some videos about magazine reloading and bump stocks and how AR15s work. I can’t teach you all of the basics on Twitter
2091 2018-02-25 01:46:44 98% des meurtres sont faite avec une armes illégale volé ou modifié avec des dispositif comme les bump stocks. Encore une fois les moutons rapporte n importe quoi
2092 2018-02-25 01:44:52 End Sale of bump stocks dont help. Peoe will get illegally just get the military style weapons off the street.
2093 2018-02-25 01:44:32 High capacity magazines and bump stocks would be illegal as well.  Heightened presence of under covers in schools as airlines use verses arming teachers.  Change needs to happen and law enforcement as well as school officials need to discuss how
2094 2018-02-25 01:44:15 I'm a life member of the NRA. The National Rifle Association must start representing the members. The NRA has never asked a member what they think about bump stocks, background checks or any important issue.
2095 2018-02-25 01:43:24 #EconomyToday Inflation is coming in coming years. #Gold might keep you even in theory . Forget Bonds and Dividend Stocks , Utilities,Reits and Blue Chip dividend aristocrats. Only S&P Growth will save you from what’s coming.
2096 2018-02-25 01:43:21 They are fools that will see it in their bottom line and stocks
2097 2018-02-25 01:43:07 Go buy some stocks not a chain.
2098 2018-02-25 01:43:02 1) integrated federal background checks using a system that all states and federal agencies report to, 2) ban high capacity semi auto weapons, 3) ban bump stocks, 4) ban silencers, 5) ban hi cap magazines
2099 2018-02-25 01:43:01 what r u talking about? bump stocks? nobody cares, they r worthless

minimum age? to buy or to use? what age?

why would the cdc study guns?

the nra is against all this? really?
2100 2018-02-25 01:42:34 Let me rephrase...”if anything related to weapons, including the weapons themselves is going to be banned...”
I thought “bump stocks” increase the rapidity of weapon fire, no?
2101 2018-02-25 01:42:01 It wont end with bump stocks and when Trump is gone one day whether it be 4 or 8 years these "mental health guidelines" will be expanded by the feds to include anyone, especially if we get another Obama type in office.  Try thinking for yourself once Bill.
2102 2018-02-25 01:41:50 Will the R/S happen ? Due for a bounce.
2103 2018-02-25 01:39:55 You are absolutely full of crap! Unless you have bump stocks or digi trigger on YOURS mary, its one pull per shot. STILL.
AR15s are categorically not machine guns.
2104 2018-02-25 01:39:35 #BoycottNRA - Banks and investment Co. will try to get rid of their “weapon producing Co.” stocks. Hence they will sell it to you, through FUNDS! A non-transparent collect of inefficient stocks (owned by banks and investment Co.) sold to you!
2105 2018-02-25 01:38:59 Most deadly nation, most sick nation, most self absorbed nation. No one should have the right to own auto or semi auto weapons, bump stocks, large capacity mags. Your second amendment to bear arms is one thing yes, to hunt children is another! #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
2106 2018-02-25 01:38:54 Honestly the words “Gun culture” are nonexistent in many countries. America has a problem bigger than just implementing a law against bump stocks.
2107 2018-02-25 01:38:47 Hmmm that's funny... I heard the NRA supports gun laws like stronger background checks a d banning bump stocks.  Stop lying for your agenda!!!!!
2108 2018-02-25 01:38:36 No private gun sales.
Universal background checks even at gun shows.
10 round magazine limit.
No bump stocks.
Mental health evaluations.
20 day waiting period.
Licenses, registration and insurance for all guns.
Domestic violence ban.
Ban on so-called “assault rifles.”
2109 2018-02-25 01:38:25 Some of these people acting like they have stocks in these companies with the way they are defending them 
2110 2018-02-25 01:38:06 We need to stop entertaining and discussing this ridiculous proposal! Focus on the real solutions : ban all assault rifles , bump stocks, perfect background checks, raise age to purchase guns to 21, waiting period to purchase gun 2 weeks, and national gun registry #Guncontrolnow
2111 2018-02-25 01:37:12 WOW! Best line said ...after being hypnotized by someone with more knowledge about guns, we still have a problem. P.S. No one wants to take everyone's gun away...and bump stocks were used in Vegas. What was he talking about!?  #neveragain
2112 2018-02-25 01:36:40 3/ A lone LEO cannot protect a school. It is a talisman that makes people feel better, a prayer without corresponding actions. The fact is we need to make bump stocks and military style weapons illegal. Stricter background checks and licensing. Do what Australia did.
2113 2018-02-25 01:36:13 Goat wtf we’re still not done I’m up on you still it’s 5 stocks to 3
2114 2018-02-25 01:35:39 But yes, it is a powerful weapon and a consumer version (semi-auto only) of the former standard issue M16.

My concerns are the detachable large capacity magazines and the still legal bump stocks (a work around to somewhat convert semi-auto to psuedo-full-auto).
2115 2018-02-25 01:33:19 Need a good book about stocks. #stocks #StockMarket #NASDAQ
2116 2018-02-25 01:32:55 My only point with the stats above is, if weapons and weapon enhancers (bump stocks, magazine clips) are going to be banned, on what basis shall they be banned?  Would it not be the number of potential injuries potentially inflicted by one person?
2117 2018-02-25 01:32:54 Wow! The NRA boycott is really taking off. I think Phase 2 is to focus on this as well as people who sit on  boards of those companies, and fund managers (TIAA, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc) who have gun stocks in their portfolios AND the companies who support the NRA.
2118 2018-02-25 01:32:05 Selling stocks for a depreciating asset is OUCH. Thank you for sharing :)
2119 2018-02-25 01:31:55 Then let’s start with banning pistol grips, 15+ mags, bump stocks, and raise the buying age to 21. In addition to all the changes to the background checks (ie fix what trump undid re SSI, require universal background checks) + create gun restraining orders.  No reason not to.
2120 2018-02-25 01:31:54 Interesting. European equities are positively correlated with the euro, while Japanese stocks move inversely to the yen (I think). It's hard
2121 2018-02-25 01:31:06 I am diversified in many ways through stocks etfs indexes land etc in traditional markets. I enjoy fintech and investing. You use coinbase?
2122 2018-02-25 01:30:15 A fake one
Bump stocks NP
Was already in the works
They will lose 50x more business from regular customers
They already were dummy
Whatever that is
Means zero but who's going to steal that money?
2123 2018-02-25 01:29:03 Time to sell some shares of stocks IMO.
2124 2018-02-25 01:28:14 Quick, sell your Mike Perry stocks before it plummets. #ufcorlando
2125 2018-02-25 01:27:08 What are the relevance of your stocks to ejk.. know your facts.. stocks are bullish right now see HVN NOW VLL TUGS.. pota maka ngawa walang ebidensya..
2126 2018-02-25 01:26:20 NRA members are only 1.5 million. We, the other 300 million, will support all companies who ditch the hatefilled alt-right NRA millionaire CEOs club. BAN selling ALL military type weapons AR 15 or bump stocks to ANY private citizens.
2127 2018-02-25 01:26:11 Michael Collins "... that's what happens people sell all their stocks and bonds to move to cash..."

But if people sell bonds that RAISES rates making bonds more appealing.

The Fixed Income Fee Fairy won't save these folks.
2128 2018-02-25 01:26:09 He would have been worth over 10 billion if he had just put the money he inherited from his father into managed stocks & bonds
2129 2018-02-25 01:26:09 @realDonaldTrump If you want to put in a ban on the useless bump-stocks, please negotiate suppressors off of the NFA'34 $200 tax as a compromise.

Will you ban Jerry Miculek who is within an eye-blink of being as fast as an NFA registered AK-47 using only a semi-auto rifle?
2130 2018-02-25 01:25:07 Get acorns if you shop a lot. It invests in stocks for you based off what you like and it doesn't require that much either to start.  Same with robinhood. I'm new to forex still
2131 2018-02-25 01:24:44 I guess if they want sponsors back they should give something up! Maybe raise the age? Ban AR15? Ban bump stocks?
We all have to sacrifice for the good of the innocent.  
#StandUpToTheNRA
2132 2018-02-25 01:23:51 When a democrat is in office, gun sales skyrocket, the day after Trump won stocks plummeted. Now with the #BoycottNRA they can pump up sales again, why, because the left is coming for your guns. It’s a lie, we actually agree with you all only people that pass a background check.
2133 2018-02-25 01:23:16 NRA opposes expanding background checks (for all private gun sells), opposes banning bump stocks, opposes raising minimum age to buy rifles, & opposes public/government (CDC) research/studies on gun violence

All these are common sense regulations that the nra lobbies against.
2134 2018-02-25 01:21:53 I'm have been shooting weapons since I was 8 yrs old. NOTHING about this makes sense. Bump stocks aside. NOTHING makes sense with Vegas.
2135 2018-02-25 01:20:13 Same I think we should be limited to six shooters and bolt-action rifles/shotguns but even that might be pushing it. We need to start by getting rid of these military grade highly modifiable semi autos as well as bump stocks immediately. The blood of our youth cries out
2136 2018-02-25 01:19:55 Dan, we old members need to walk away, leave the NRA to what it’s become-representing gun manufacturers profits & people that feel AK-15’s & bump stocks are reasonable-like Kurt & Sara  
Nothing says hunting like blowing your game to smithereens-Says something about character tho
2137 2018-02-25 01:19:49 They can cut ties all they want. I agree bump stocks need not be available except for the military. But I also agree the right to bear and maintain firearms is to maintain government with out tyrany, it is about more than rights.
2138 2018-02-25 01:19:47 And we can ban 30 round magazines and bump stocks. A multi-faceted approach is warranted, and your data proves reducing access to military-style weapons reduces (but doesn't eliminate) gun violence.
2139 2018-02-25 01:17:56 I spy a list of companies that stocks are going to drop.
2140 2018-02-25 01:17:18 Don't worry, once we get assault rifles, extended magazines, bump stocks, etc. off the street over the next few decades, no one will really care because hunters will always be able to hunt with rifles designed for it. Meanwhile, our schools will be safer.
2141 2018-02-25 01:16:21 "Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of media pundits."
#WarrenBuffett #CharlieMunger
2142 2018-02-25 01:16:14 There actually isn’t one common thread. The killer a VTech used a handgun. The crazy guy a SPU used a shotgun. Charles Whitman used a regular rifle and a shotgun. The LV lunatic used bump stocks, which should have never been legal in the first place.
2143 2018-02-25 01:15:57 He’s a phony that has unemployment rate lowest it has been since 1973. All time unemployment lows for blacks and Hispanics. Businesses are booming. Consumer confidence levels at all time high. Wages are rising and workers receiving great tax cuts. Stocks flying and ISIS crushed
2144 2018-02-25 01:15:40 also this sounds suspiciously like what i would expect your inner monologue to be
edit: i was wrong, i read "stocks" as "socks"

2146 2018-02-25 01:14:29 No one said you could eliminate guns.   We said. Raise the age of legal purchase.  Get rid of bump stocks. There are many things we can do.  We just have to sit down and weigh them out.  Nobody here wants your guns.  We just want something to be done to eliminate these atrocities
2147 2018-02-25 01:14:15 Great. Hope you'll be working across party lines. Question: how does it make sense to ban bump stocks and not regulate assault weapons?
2148 2018-02-25 01:13:29 But wasn't Obama the 1 who approved bump stocks?..twice!
2149 2018-02-25 01:13:27 that’s my inner monologue, minus the recital and stocks
2150 2018-02-25 01:12:47 FAKE DAD inner monologue: “sports, wife, hamburgers, little billy’s piano recital was pretty good, stocks, wish i had a fast car, tweed”
2151 2018-02-25 01:12:03 Credit card companies can be pressured to refuse to allow their cards to be used to purchase guns. Gun makers also use credit cards to make purchases. And, teachers are pressuring their pension fund managers to drop gun related stocks. #NeverAgain
2152 2018-02-25 01:11:13 Derrick stocks dog food at PetSmart. If it ain't Alpo, he doesn't know jack. Hey Derrick, what is the best kind of food for my German Shepard? Finally, a question @derricklittle88 knows lol
2153 2018-02-25 01:11:12 In my mind there is zero excuse for not immediately enacting:

1.  Ban on Bump Stocks
2.  21 age requirement for automatic weapons of any kind.
3.  Background checks, close loopholes.
4. Three-day hold of guns if reported by family member.

I want a lot more, but start here.
2154 2018-02-25 01:11:02 Isn’t there a law requiring a background check? Perhaps it could be beefed up with safeguards against the mentally ill purchasing one. I’d draw the line there. No encroachments. More bump-stocks, please. Bring out the fully automatics! And I’ll have a tank with that order.
2155 2018-02-25 01:10:06 I can’t wait to start watching all these stocks tank
2156 2018-02-25 01:07:24 My rental prius from Alamo came with a trunk full of Glock 29's equipped with bump stocks. Not cool, Alamo! Taking my business to Enterprise.
2157 2018-02-25 01:07:20 That said I am all for a 10 round clip limit and banning bump stocks, tougher mental health regulations, owner responsiblilty. The problem I don’t see with the gun itself, but the mentality of glorifying them (especially Hollywood).
2158 2018-02-25 01:07:19 @NRA actually advocated the ban of bump stocks.  Stop watching @CNN.
2159 2018-02-25 01:06:42 I wonder how many Black people invested they tax money in Stocks or a Business
2160 2018-02-25 01:06:22 Am I alone in longer term wanting to reduce gun stocks in this country? With 300 M guns it's just too likely guns will get into the wrong hands.
2161 2018-02-25 01:05:34 Then we will show them what kind of paper Grandpas business stocks are printed on. We will see if theirs are too?
2162 2018-02-25 01:04:16 The kid bought an assault rifle at 18 or before & was shooting the place up. It happened here in Las Vegas too. If bump stocks & assault rifles we're not available, Paddock wouldn't have been able to shoot 50+ pple from that far away. answer the question I asked. Net neutrality
2163 2018-02-25 01:03:28 Thanks Investor Influence Positive Stocks for the follow!
2164 2018-02-25 01:03:17 What's incredibly funny...the IRS is revoking passports for people that owe over $50K in back taxes...So, who in the hell do these airlines think will be using their services...they've all but eliminated their international travelers...and the NRA...dump all your airline stocks!
2165 2018-02-25 01:02:16 ~sa ngaun wala akong open preorder.. yun lang stocks ko na talaga ngaun
2166 2018-02-25 01:00:21 And the FBI and school officers messed up the Vegas mass murder, the one in texas, the ones at Sandy Hook, columbine?  . . . its endless. Its about weapons of war, bump stocks, high velocity ammo and huge magazines. That's an issue of law, thus politics.
2167 2018-02-25 00:59:22 You're looking to find a gotcha to discredit my sources while you provide no sources only talking points to support your allusive US growth story so I'm not offering any more to your thread. Trump said "even if you raise interest rates a little bit stocks will come crashing down"
2168 2018-02-25 00:59:12 Barao-Kelleher could have been stopped. Brutal ending, saved by the horn. Impressive onslaught by Kelleher. 
There’s two stocks going in very different directions.

2169 2018-02-25 00:58:54 What are your thoughts on the next rally in pot stocks? Things have felt a little stale lately.
2170 2018-02-25 00:57:54 Your NRA wants bump stocks, doesn't want age restrictions modified, votes on bills to make getting guns easier.

Nra doesnt care about you, or your kids. It just cares the more guns get into more hands. Bottom line is you'll always make excuses for the NRA, no matter what
2171 2018-02-25 00:56:28 @Konami Pretty pathetic that you fire your main guy and then release a shit game with his brand on it. AND you pay all these people to promote your game! Good job sinking your company, I'll be willing to buy you stocks when they drop to pennies.
2172 2018-02-25 00:56:17 Out eating habachi, and there’s a little kid across the table talking about his “stocks club” at school. He’s already up $150 on $AAPL!
2173 2018-02-25 00:56:14 Bump stocks are a currently legal accessory for guns, but they are just a gimmick. There is no benefit to them other than to make it simulate fully-automatic fire, which is not used by anyone that actually hunts. If someone does use it for hunting, that is just cruelty.
2174 2018-02-25 00:55:43 Keep going towards the source. ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS.O
2175 2018-02-25 00:55:42 Stalin's mustache made out of Cigarette pack! WHILE STOCKS LAST!
2176 2018-02-25 00:55:39 They’re marketing fear to you and shame so that you can buy more guns right now. They have to look out for their stocks. Listen, don’t buy into, literally! Be smarter than that! This is all a ploy. Follow the marketing! Now they shame law enforcement? It’s to sell more guns.
2177 2018-02-25 00:55:30 And meanwhile, others are destroying people with bump stocks.
2178 2018-02-25 00:55:29 good.   If you end the sale of bump stocks I will actually give you credit for doing one good thing.
2179 2018-02-25 00:54:51 Exactly! People need to know the stocks their funds include. I directed our new investment manager a few months ago that our funds must be free of gun stocks. Several state teacher retirement funds include gun stocks too. 
Also, @Walmart how about #WalmartWithoutGuns #NeverAgain
2180 2018-02-25 00:54:28 That’s me when I buy regular stocks
2181 2018-02-25 00:54:16 Nope. Also..smash with what? The only thing that will actually likely break are the standard handguards, stocks and grips, not even the handguard if its the rail type.
Will be amusing watching these lightweight pvssys trying to wield a sledge big enough to break anything more.
2182 2018-02-25 00:53:30 Perhaps, the "local city, state and the federal government" should offer a voluntary BUY BACK of AR15's and BUMP STOCKS ! Young people would appreciate the extra cash, as well Grandparents could dispose of there unused stored weapons. That would be a first good start.
2183 2018-02-25 00:52:34 Baloney.Please believe that! It’s great news 4 Democrats & all new students eligible to register and vote in 2018. Russian hacking into our voter database should be monitored by the FBI and all Intel PLUS Facebook, Twitter, Google better monitor/control.Or else dump their stocks!
2184 2018-02-25 00:51:32 good short there stocks cause they will lose ticket sales
2185 2018-02-25 00:51:08 @united you just lost a ton of money and support from me and "EVERYONE " that I know. 
We are Boycotting you for life. 
We Support the NRA!
Nothing you can do about it other than watch your stocks and ticket sales drop to nothing. 
Boycotting United!
2186 2018-02-25 00:50:10 Hey I appreciate it.  I grew up with shotguns and such, and I think there's plenty of responsible gun owners out there.  But this idea that you have to be able to get high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, assault rifles is dumb.  I sure don't want to take away all guns!

2188 2018-02-25 00:48:53 Perhaps you should do some research on who actually owns stocks in this country - including through retirement accounts.  And as for pensions?  Get real dude.  Just get real.
2189 2018-02-25 00:48:33 Huh I never knew. Thank you for making this known to me! I appreciate it. But I do agree that people don't need bump stocks and 60 round ammo drums so perhaps we can start there then take bigger steps
2190 2018-02-25 00:47:42 #ProTip buy gun stocks.  Sales will skyrocket.  Profits will go up.  #GunControl
2191 2018-02-25 00:45:56 No it's not bump stocks are not adjustable like the one in the video
2192 2018-02-25 00:45:50 If you own these companies stocks,time to SELL And Boycott forever!
2193 2018-02-25 00:45:10 j’ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière, que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien, que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines, que tu me dises que c'est rien
2194 2018-02-25 00:44:45 Obama made bump stocks legal , same tool.used in Vegas shooting.where were you then .
2195 2018-02-25 00:44:35 This is trumps mo. Defection from the real issue. These g-damn ar-15 assault rifles & bump stocks need banned. Background checks implemented & enforced n every state, legal age 2 buy guns should b 21, mental health a major factor n ability 2 purchase. Teachers r not swat officers
2196 2018-02-25 00:43:59 Very disappointed to hear @Angelabishop make out as if @realDonaldTrump was taking serious action on gun violence by banning bump stocks. These devices have never been used in school shootings and until Las Vegas even most shooters hadn’t heard of them.
2197 2018-02-25 00:43:51 I agree they need to limit weapons like assault riffles, & bump stocks but if you take the gun out of this situation you will find 2 things 1.This could have been prevented by local law and FBI. 2.If not a guy he would have used a bomb or a car or a sword. He needed mental help.
2198 2018-02-25 00:43:30 FYI bump stocks were invented 2 fill the market 4 machineguns. The 1984 Hugh's Amendt. ended any added ones into the highly screened & licensed registration 2 private individuals. Prices 4 already reg ones skyrocketed. So it's the govt. that created the unregulated alternative.
2199 2018-02-25 00:42:22 True. ARMY votes by buying songs/albums/tickets and buying out entire stocks of merch within minutes. Voting is time consuming.

2209 2018-02-25 00:37:14 Not what I said. No gun owner, military member, LEO, or even NRA member I know supports LaPierre or the current NRA agenda. None support semiautomatics, bump stocks, or similar in the hands of civilians.

2211 2018-02-25 00:36:29 #AskWarren @SquawkCNBC How can a "legal" immigrant build a investment portfolio with long term thinking? I often end up trading stocks instead of investing in companies/stocks due to the constraints around immigration.
2212 2018-02-25 00:35:18 Page 10 of the BRK Annual should be read by everyone: Warren Buffett on the high risks of margin lending: “This table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks. There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period.”
2213 2018-02-25 00:35:08 Absolutely, since I didn’t even know I got those discounts as a member.  But now that I know, I will vehemently block, and stay away from all the companies that were against you.   Let’s see all their stocks in 5 months. I will boycott all of them.  339million guns in US. #NRA

2217 2018-02-25 00:32:30 Hahahahaha.  My dad sighted rifles for the border patrol.  He flew the game warden into the Gila looking for poachers.  He built gun stocks.  A very proud member of NRA.  Spoke 7 languages, and passed the bar in 3 states.
2218 2018-02-25 00:32:07 I live in a North Idaho!  Moose, Cougars and Bears roam our yards all of the time.  All hunters have 47s and 15s.  A hand gun will only piss these animals off if they are running toward your kid. These are riffles!  Not machine guns! Now, ban the bump stocks ALL you want!
2219 2018-02-25 00:31:52 #AskWarren How can a "legal" immigrant build a investment portfolio with long term thinking? I often end up trading stocks instead of investing in companies/stocks due to the constraints around immigration.
2220 2018-02-25 00:31:31 How did the Obama administration “implement” bump stocks? How do you implement a weapon accessory? You make no sense. If you mean “approve” then that’s a distortion of facts. They found that under current weapon legislation, it was not legal to deny sales without legislation.
2221 2018-02-25 00:31:29 Share buybacks for top strata? That doesn’t even make sense. Everyone with any kind of retirement account or pension that invests in stocks benefits from the higher stock prices that result from those massive share buybacks.
2222 2018-02-25 00:31:14 Buying and trading stocks is way more fun than you would think
2223 2018-02-25 00:30:55 Thanks for the RT and like of the top 5 EPS #stocks @ioTrader $BUFF up a whopping 17% on Friday. Good luck and have an awesome weekend.
2224 2018-02-25 00:30:12 Let me guess Warren will say #bitcoin is a scam or something negative just like he missed the boat on all tech stocks... too bad so sad Warren
2225 2018-02-25 00:29:44 @NRA instead of saying that it will work with authorities to keep guns off the hands of potential shooters, enforce background checks & restricting bump stocks, is unapologetic and blames others!
Not to mention being mean to kids!
2226 2018-02-25 00:29:33 #BoycottNRA BOYCOTT any company who supports this kind of propaganda and those who support weapons like AR-15’s any type of bump stocks.
2227 2018-02-25 00:29:04 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. No military grade weapons in our communities
2228 2018-02-25 00:28:13 Props to @KylieJenner for letting Snapchat be cheap to cop with stocks and shares. Thank you.
2229 2018-02-25 00:28:06 Everyone supports banning bump stocks. Everyone supports universal background checks (including vast majority of NRA members). It's time the death lobby got kicked in their bump stocks. #BoycottNRA
2230 2018-02-25 00:27:10 Sam, got respect for you. Strategy brilliant, style unique... why you have a ton of copycats. But the answer is “simple.” 1-we can’t all be playing the same 4 stocks... 2- other plays do make money, undeniable!
2231 2018-02-25 00:26:52 I believe it is according the 2nd amendment. You are saying it’s not included? Well it’s not excluded. Get rid of bump stocks, raise the buying age.
2232 2018-02-25 00:26:40 It's too dynamic for things to remain the same for long. Assets in our market don't have real long-term value, so everything is more or less buy or sell depending on your circumstances. Oversimplifying, but it's more like dealing in potatoes or hog bellies than stocks for sure.
2233 2018-02-25 00:25:50 @RepTedLieu Can’t wait to see the rental car stocks drop Monday!!
2234 2018-02-25 00:25:37 I'm done arguing. You are more than welcome to have your option but 1) A walkout is a politically motivated event. 2) Background checks should be required for weapon purchase (mental health issue=no gun/weapon) 3) Civilian don't need assault rifles or bump stocks

2237 2018-02-25 00:24:06 If you want to hurt the gun industry this isn't a very good use of your time.    Divesting from companies doesn't usually hurt them.  

Take a look at the history of cigarette stocks.
2238 2018-02-25 00:24:05 how long have you been following penny stocks?
2239 2018-02-25 00:24:01 DID YOU KNOW: Computer shops keeds stocks of USED and NEW PARTS, and when you repair a part on your PC they charge a retail price. No more i only charge what it cost for me to get it from the warehouse.
2240 2018-02-25 00:23:58 Modified. Big flipping deal. Easily remodified. And the NRA is not going to support banning bump stocks. The AR-15 was designed for military. Plain and simple. No one needs one. It does not kill zombies. It doesn’t make your penis bigger and it doesn’t give you one.
2241 2018-02-25 00:22:08 On PBS Friday Brooks endorses banning bumper stocks, raising the minimum age, enhanced background checks but gives no credit to the President for proposing these changes. Teachers in suburban rural areas are no strangers to guns.  Let it be optional like Trump proposed.

2243 2018-02-25 00:21:15 After escaping from a smoke filled bus and working tonight, I think I'm ready for a large wine. The @VirginWines stocks will soon need topped up.
2244 2018-02-25 00:20:37 It would take longer than a tweet to identify semi-automatic and any modifiers, bump stocks or large capacity mags...so just leave it general. Regulation would need to encompass future technologies, which 2A did NOT. (Yeah, yeah, we know the Gatling..)
2245 2018-02-25 00:20:10 It's going to be kinda ironic when the Resistance Left is utilizing these same bump stocks and AR-15s and school kids in their terror attacks vs American citizens.
You didn't think the pro-crime pro-criminal side was disarming also? No, they just want lawful Americans disarmed.

2247 2018-02-25 00:19:38 Well since automatic weapons are illegal and bump stocks allow the gun to fire at almost the same rate, I can see why they want to ban them. But then again I don’t think the government should be able to control what attachments we use. You give them an inch & they’ll take a mile.

2250 2018-02-25 00:18:38 I guess they feel somebody has to profit shipping these guns and bump stocks, why not them?

2253 2018-02-25 00:16:48 This is a multi-pronged problem.  Background checks, assault weapons, bump stocks.  One alone is not enough
2254 2018-02-25 00:16:18 Do you believe people should have access to bump stocks?
2255 2018-02-25 00:14:38 I completely agree. You might as well go and chart bio stocks...

2258 2018-02-25 00:12:14 Even with bump stocks or whatever? Can they be upgraded easily? I agree people hunt, great, and want personal protection, great, but military grade weapons? for me, no. Thanks for the info tho.
2259 2018-02-25 00:11:38 That’s not how @Betterment works - they buy broad indices. They can’t divest from single stocks. You should petition the ETF providers.
2260 2018-02-25 00:11:25 It seems this country really wants to be run on emotions rather than common sense. I just don't see how these students are yelling about bum stocks while millions of fetuses are being aborted each year and they stay quiet!

2261 2018-02-25 00:11:18 Stocks in blonde hair dye plummet overnight
2262 2018-02-25 00:10:41 The first response I see is that guns are going to be taken away. Nope! Just assault type weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. You need home protection? Buy a shotgun. You are so fearful you have to CC, you still can. You like to hunt? You're covered.
2263 2018-02-25 00:10:10 Makes sense. Bump stocks usually jam and make the weapon useless.
2264 2018-02-25 00:09:48 It irritates me that Trump tells Sessions to "regulate bump stocks" when the ATF already determined they can't, as it's technically an accessory and not a firearm- Congress has to act. So nothing legislative is going to happen unless this level of pressure keeps up thru November.
2265 2018-02-25 00:08:44 no...what I'm saying is, if one wishes to become a Mass Murderer, the AR-15 would be their Weapon Of Choice.  and our current gun laws make this all to easy.  the Vegas shooter was able to hit over 500 people, albeit with bump stocks.
2266 2018-02-25 00:08:04 the like-boosting alogrithms are bump stocks
2267 2018-02-25 00:07:50 Normally I’d agree if my ump today didn’t call a pitch that hit my arm a strike
2268 2018-02-25 00:07:45 I am a big supporter of yours, but I do not agree with raising the age or ending the sale of bump stocks. We need to protect ourselves in the real world. We have no security team.
2269 2018-02-25 00:06:46 Stock size sets overall sustainable limit, yes. But question is how to divide that among countries when stocks straddle different countries borders. That's where the UK hopes to gain with Brexit
2270 2018-02-25 00:06:46 Military assault weapons, bump stocks & high capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. Elected officials taking @NRA cash will be voted out.  It’s time for change.  #ENOUGH
2271 2018-02-25 00:06:43 My stocks going up!
2272 2018-02-25 00:06:35 @FedExHelp how many of your customers have shipped bump stocks via your service in the last 5 years?
2273 2018-02-25 00:05:22 4) if the size of magazines were regulated and bump stocks were banned, this would limit the damage that is possible 5) if a shooter only had access to a pistol they would not do nearly as much "damage"
2274 2018-02-25 00:04:25 Monday's evening news: "In a shocking turn, several airline & rental car companies' stocks mysteriously plummeted today. Experts are at a loss to explain why.  But nobel economist Paul Krugman blamed the NRA..."
2275 2018-02-25 00:04:04 @realDonaldTrump I see you are caught in a precarious situation on keeping schools safe and gun-control. I support the banning of bump stocks and more stringent gun control for youths.
Keep up the good work—“Make America Great Again”.

2277 2018-02-25 00:02:26 This is fantastic news, thanks @united.  @NRA doesn’t seem to care for innocent school children or perhaps they just aren’t listening?   Military assault weapons, bump stocks & high capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. #BoycottNRA #ENOUGH
2278 2018-02-25 00:01:22 On what criteria do you define the things that need age restrictions?
I don't understand the boundaries of "etc." Opening a bank account? Trading stocks? Going to school? 
What about First Communion or Confirmation?
2279 2018-02-25 00:00:35 Do  you take more of an active or passive role in your investments? #401(k) #stocks?
2280 2018-02-25 00:00:35 Yes, the plan is to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and have stricter background checks for all purchases of guns, for starters. #NeverAgain #MSD strong #NRAIsATerroristOrganization #Enough #EmmaGonzalez #GunReform #BanAssaultWeapons #MarchForOurLives #MomsDemandAction
2281 2018-02-25 00:00:24 Brooks totally ignores Pontus's other proposals: raising the minimum age, outlaw bumper stocks, enhanced background checks.  Teachers in suburban and rural areas are no strangers to guns.  Let it be optional as Trump proposed..

2300 2018-02-24 23:50:00 So, we have to start small. (1) Ban Automatic rifles which obviously leaves the responsible owners with theirs but stops the sales. (2) ban bump stocks (3) actually perform background checks and enforce reporting to NICS (4) limit significantly magazine sizes to not more than 10

2322 2018-02-24 23:49:17 The ONLY Good Thing I’ve Seen Trump Trying To Do Is Ban Bump Stocks ....
2323 2018-02-24 23:48:37 Do any of these companies or other US companies invest pension dollars, cash/reserves or proprietary trading accounts in any gun stocks?
2324 2018-02-24 23:48:28 millions were made between the time Nick Cruz was know as a potential threat until he finished he last bullet from the bump stocks?
2325 2018-02-24 23:47:15 And the very best part...stocks are not expensive when considering where rates are today.
2326 2018-02-24 23:46:51 In order to clarify my position, I've never been interested in bump stocks for firearms (Too many shots being wasted, and not at all accurate!). Yet, when liberals use a situation to try and rob me of my rights, it becomes time to throw down! Hope that helps.
2327 2018-02-24 23:46:37 Gun restrictions will lose you votes. Fake news is fake news. Gun control is real news. Russia mean nothing. Bump stocks.....now that’s limiting our ability to respond with equal force.
2328 2018-02-24 23:46:13 Be nice to actually have laws which effect criminals for once instead of law abiding citizens. They already reduced mag capacity It's not an issue. They wouldn't know a .50 rifle if they fell over one. These two hurt legal owners The other things are fine add ban bump stocks.
2329 2018-02-24 23:45:40 Creating a “diversified portfolio” by collecting some stocks and Bitcoin, as well as any cool looking rocks I find on the ground
2330 2018-02-24 23:43:43 U couldn’t be more wrong. We need to ban assault weapons , bump stocks, magazines that hold 30-100 bullets & any device that alters a gun. There is no place for those in our society. I have a CCW license. It is about them being MEN that day not cowards. Just that simple.
2331 2018-02-24 23:43:38 Time to also go after gun manufacturers which bankroll NRA. How?  Demand state & local authorities to divest any holdings in gun stocks #BoycottNRA
2332 2018-02-24 23:42:14 I and nearly everyone I know, will no longer fly your airline due to this irrational political, not business,  decision. Stupidity is reason to sell your stocks as well.
2333 2018-02-24 23:41:45 They’re selling AR-15 assault weapons with bump stocks like in your picture to the public?
2334 2018-02-24 23:41:06 Bump stocks are a moot point.
2335 2018-02-24 23:40:55 Did I ever mention $NFLX? You keep jumping around on stocks and have a problem with your spell correction. It’s probably Spiegel.
2336 2018-02-24 23:40:50 Crazy to me, too. The answer is so obvious: eliminate semi-auto.rifles, bump stocks, raise age of purchase, strengthen bkgrnd checks, extend waiting period. Just commonsense that benefits ALL - & doesn't take all guns away. Kids living in a military state is NUTS.
2337 2018-02-24 23:40:03 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. #forex #stocks
2338 2018-02-24 23:36:48 You all need to keep it up! The only things that might have prevented the Las Vegas shooter (59 dead-527 wounded) would have been an assault weapons ban, magazine capacity limits and bump stock ban. They were going take a look at banning bump stocks, remember? Nothing happened.
2339 2018-02-24 23:36:45 @vice are thieves. They poached my YouTube video on bump stocks, played it on HBO,  and then said that they got it from ABC who I’d given permission to.  Huh??? So as long as one person gets permission, all can have it. #hacks @HBO #amateurs
2340 2018-02-24 23:35:58 @united @Delta you have lost my business. You both are pathetic airlines as you run scared from the liberals by dissing the @NRA.  Hopefully your stocks tank over this idiotic decision.
2341 2018-02-24 23:35:45 @toddstarnes Our children are voicing the frustration felt by the majority of Americans who support common sense gun safety laws like background checks and bans on bump stocks and assault weapons. I plan to vote with my wallet.  That’s a great thing about capitalism. #boycottNRA
2342 2018-02-24 23:35:21 Dems claim theyre anti-racism, anti-sex assault/adultry & enraged at mass shootings yet:

had KKK Grand Cyclops Robert Byrd serve 50yrs as senator & Hillary refer to black males as superpredators

supported Bill Clinton

Most mass shooting under Pres Obama, approved bump stocks
2343 2018-02-24 23:34:40 We can start with banning AR15s and bump stocks
2344 2018-02-24 23:34:28 Just cancel my rental hit this baster in the wallet boycotting this company and watch their stocks plummet
2345 2018-02-24 23:34:15 Does anyone have suggestions on how to support #NeverAgain by pressuring pension funds, mutual funds, Vanguard, Blackrock and others to divest of stocks that profit from assault weapons?  Feel free to DM me with suggestions.
2346 2018-02-24 23:33:46 @realDonaldTrump raise age to 25 for AK type weapons. Fingerprint national background checks. End bump stocks. Feds give back to States 10 billion per year to decide how to use to protect schools. Get GOP to do this & you will be etched in history for being the only pres to do it
2347 2018-02-24 23:33:40 Assault rifle is fully automatic which an AR15 (which stands for ARmalite-15 btw) is not, bump stocks are another issue entirely however, they make an otherwise normal weapon into something that fires at a faster rate. That is wear i draw a line not with the gun but the mod
2348 2018-02-24 23:31:54 I fully support banning assault rifles and bump stocks. No one needs those. Full background checks and a waiting period before purchasing a gun. Raise the age to buy a gun. There’s a lot of work to be done. Idk the solution, but those are things to start with.
2349 2018-02-24 23:31:03 Bump stocks are an easy example.....ANY modification to ANY gun should be an automatic prison sentence
2350 2018-02-24 23:30:29 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Droid Background Checks with an emphasis on Droid Mental Health. Raise droid age to 21 and end sale of Blaster Stocks! ImpSen is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
2351 2018-02-24 23:29:01 OH for sure hotshot's stocks are skyrocketting x) I got through like half the show before school took over my schedule
2352 2018-02-24 23:28:14 No, assault weapons, magazines over 10, bump stocks, they should be banned.
License gun ranges to have them available for use there.
Eliminate gun show sales. Background checks with a 5 day waiting period.
License with proficiency test makes sense.
2353 2018-02-24 23:27:57 -accomplices to refuse to downgrade bonds-stocks etc., to price them accurately in order to flush people who smartly shorted the housing market & other instruments Goldman Sachs used their bets etc..

2356 2018-02-24 23:27:21 But Trump is already pushing Congress to ban bump stocks, raise the weapon purchase age, & to have stronger background checks w a nation registry...Last time I checked, no republican has vowed for this. Whether you like him or not he’s taking action.
2357 2018-02-24 23:27:12 Unless we see some real change in the party makeup of congress a full ban on military style tactical weapons is a tall order. Go after NRA $$$- stop large capacity mags, bump stocks, look to have ATF stop  Franklin Armory BFS Trigger...can change AR to speed of  #neveragain
2358 2018-02-24 23:26:26 How about this, moron.  Start with the ban on Auto and semi auto weapons and bump stocks. Serious backround checks and waiting periods. No sales to people on watch list or with mental health disqualifiers. Stop with the BS. 
It's all a game until one of yours is slaughtered.

2360 2018-02-24 23:25:41 You can ban bump stocks and black hair dye. I could care less.
2361 2018-02-24 23:25:22 I have a Glock M9 with laser stocks.
2362 2018-02-24 23:25:08 Let's ALL protest Trump. Who the hell in their right mind would want our stocks soaring? We must be crazy to like the unemployment rate down. We need Hillary in office to supply Russia and Iran with uranium and money. Damnit why did I vote Trump.
2363 2018-02-24 23:24:48 First if all: thst‘s what you got? Semantics? So people use the term wrong. So what?
Then: yeah, awesome. So machine guns are regulsted while semi–automatics like the AR are not. So what? Bump stocks that make a semi the near equivalent of a full auro are still legal.
2364 2018-02-24 23:24:43 Yes that is why there are bump stocks.
2365 2018-02-24 23:24:42 Yeah, If you use the Best buy web site to check stocks, no, thank you. I can tell what it's worth. Also until you hold my money, I can't afford it. Don't have time to treasure hunting with you guys. Give me my money back  so I can go to a serious shop.
2366 2018-02-24 23:24:19 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the FL shooting.  And even if he had a bump stock he can only shoot the number of bullets he has in his mag.  This is not TV where you can shoot without reloading.
2367 2018-02-24 23:24:13 This doesn't take into the account of drafting new legislation specifically targeting bump stocks and therefore is unsound
2368 2018-02-24 23:23:58 I think Trump kinda showed he's willing to go against them (age+bump-stocks). No?
2369 2018-02-24 23:23:38 Ban bump stocks fine, anyone who has spent any time shooting can fire as fast if not faster than the assist of a bumpstock
2370 2018-02-24 23:22:20 Yes, keep the pressure up on businesses doing business with the NRA. Hit the mutual funds that own gun stocks next.
2371 2018-02-24 23:21:48 I think stopping at sells a bump stocks won't work very well now that they are out there people will will start making them and selling them in a black market or why not now that they know how to build one just by back engineering it probation causes more problems
2372 2018-02-24 23:21:47 bargain booze here never stocks those just carling 
2373 2018-02-24 23:21:47 I also just checked the stocks.... seems to me like there is no change that the boycotts have had on Starbucks. Hertz and Delta' stocks have even gone up! Looks like your boycotts haven't worked :) enjoy being a part of the problem
2374 2018-02-24 23:21:25 President...love you to death...but this Bullshit with raising the age to buy firearms and banning bump stocks dose nothing to prevent shootings
2375 2018-02-24 23:21:21 Did the shooter in Florida have bump stocks? Why are we talking about bumpstocks? What does this have to do with the shooter in Fl? Using bump stocks reduces the ability to hit anything with accuracy. They're worthless. Outlaw bumpstocks. What does that have to do with the AR?
2376 2018-02-24 23:21:17 Except when he allowed bump stocks to be legal. Speaking of bump stocks, where was your passion for banning assault rifles after the 1 Oct. shooting in Vegas?
2377 2018-02-24 23:21:15 I don't think banning AR style would be brought up to a vote by Ryan or McConnell. Maybe they allow mental issues / dangerous restraining order and ban on bump stocks because Trump supports ?
2378 2018-02-24 23:21:08 I understand far more than most about the economy & how the oligarchy functions as I used to manage a blind(which is laughable)trust with 100's of stocks etc. & was what you'd consider a 1% person. I'll give you a couple video examples of how the system is rigged.
2379 2018-02-24 23:20:27 Okay:
The Federal government bans automatic weapons under 1934 and 1986 laws.  The ATF has ruled that a bump stock does not constitute a fully automatic weapon.  Therefore a federal ban of bump stocks would be a violation of existing federal legislation
2380 2018-02-24 23:20:02 Until three days ago, you thought bump stocks were a speculative commodity.
2381 2018-02-24 23:20:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. trade forex stocks
2382 2018-02-24 23:19:03 Bump stocks are for amateurs.

2384 2018-02-24 23:18:30 sometimes I think it would be fun if we still put people in the stocks and threw tomatoes at them but twitter can be a virtual version I suppose
2385 2018-02-24 23:17:32 I am anti bump stocks and anything that turns firearms to full auto because they are not accurate. Honestly I would like to see the national guard use some of their one weekend a month 2 weeks a year as school security
2386 2018-02-24 23:17:20 I don't understand how much daylight you see between casual gun owners and the NRA. There may be a few policy differences (bump stocks, 21 years old?), but nothing dramatic. The kinds of gun control viewers we're cheering in the CNN town hall are NOT popular, NRA aside.
2387 2018-02-24 23:16:03 i kinda want to work internationally since i love traveling that’s my dream job maybe ill end up working in stocks or something
2388 2018-02-24 23:15:30 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks now. Thanks Delta. #BanAssaultRifles #GunContolNow #VetsForGunReform
2389 2018-02-24 23:14:34 Raise the age limit to 21 (that alone would have prevented florida)
Make gun classes mandatory to obtain a permit
Ban bump stocks
Make legal to suspend a gun permit application for a set amount of time if you're being investigated by FBI or other law enforcement

2392 2018-02-24 23:13:07 Can we have an executive order to ban bump stocks now?
2393 2018-02-24 23:13:00 @DelhiDean We aim to offer a wide spectrum of flavour profiles, categorised in ^ instance by mainly medium to high 'Peat' profile, and occasionally other profiles depending on the type of malt whisky. Due to the nature of rare single cask stocks/end of month, we have LESS 'Islay'
2394 2018-02-24 23:12:13 @WesternIdentity I have a question.... Do you think that AR-15's, AK-47's, etc.; bump stocks, silencers and the like, should be in the hands of private citizens?
2395 2018-02-24 23:11:46 As a former member of special forces I say bump stocks have to go now.
2396 2018-02-24 23:11:41 “Trump Rally Stocks put the very important
2397 2018-02-24 23:11:23 And I support the second amendment which states A WELL REGULATED MILITIA. I want AR15s banned, bump stocks banned, extreme vetting on background checks. That’s it. And NRA members call it taking away their rights. I want my kids to live. What about that right?
2398 2018-02-24 23:09:54 That's the only positive thing that always comes from the gun control debate. AR-15s and other firearms are flying off the shelves as per two of my local shops. Bump stocks are going too. The debate is always good for business. New buyers mind you.
2399 2018-02-24 23:09:46 Didn't I just see Trump propose raising minimum age, banning bump stocks, and expanding background checks? Doesn't sound like falling off the train. More than Obama did.
2400 2018-02-24 23:09:30 If you are anti-gun check your stock portfolio_sell yr gun stocks-american outdoor brands,storm ruger,Vista Outdoor and funds w/ Blackrock and Vanguard have them in their index funds.
2401 2018-02-24 23:08:13 No need to insult. What you’re saying is partly true. The NRA lobbies on behalf of me and other members for the continued protections of the #2A. The NRA suggested banning bump stocks long ago and advocates for safe gun storage as well as a better background check system.
2402 2018-02-24 23:08:02 stocks
2403 2018-02-24 23:06:19 Bump stocks should totally be illegal, just as m16s and fully auto AKs already are-real machine guns/actual ‘assault rifles’.
2404 2018-02-24 23:06:05 Trump tweeted his support for universal background checks, raising age to 21 and banning bump stocks days ago. And instead of seizing the opportunity that presented to actually get laws passed, they'd rather use their influence to #BanTheNRA.
2405 2018-02-24 23:04:56 Check out their stocks if you know how! You are probably the basement dwelling snowflake! #WeThePeople President @realDonaldTrump supporters Winning Bigly
2406 2018-02-24 23:04:08 #IdiotTweet  No one needs to own an AR-15 - the public is NOT the militia. We are trying to stop the carnage. Banning these weapons along with bump stocks and any mechanism that turns it into a rapid-fire gun is needed in this day and age. Try not to become the *American Taliban*
2407 2018-02-24 23:02:46 I love Amazon. I'm not going to boycott American companies affecting American jobs. Go after the Gun and Ammo Manufacturers. Look into whether any of your 401k funds holds their stocks. Meanwhile I'm sure Amazon will take the appropriate steps w/o holding a proverbial gun to them
2408 2018-02-24 23:02:32 What happens when the students take the gun from the teacher? I guess we should open up the cockpits on the airlines again too. I support gun ownership, but we do not need automatic weapons or semi-auto weapons with more than a five round magazine and we need to ban bump stocks.
2409 2018-02-24 23:02:14 What can I say, you inspire me. Just call me the wolf of Wall Street because I'm investing in all of the Stocks.
2410 2018-02-24 23:01:24 Thanks for this post. I’m not “rich” enough to have any stocks or funds; I spent all of mine on women, booze and movies. But I do have friends who will be interested in this. 
2411 2018-02-24 23:01:23 He said that it can fire 10 rounds a second not that one can pull that trigger that fast. And with bump stocks this seems possible. Please try to read properly before you spread your propaganda..
2412 2018-02-24 23:01:14 Remember this tweet when people start talking about banning bump stocks and AR-15s. Our true problem lies in the psychological health of our nation.
2413 2018-02-24 23:00:34 NRA in a written statement to ATF over a year ago suggested that bump stocks be as regulated to the extreme.
2414 2018-02-24 22:57:59 You have to listen to the kind of gun reforms these people are talking about. Raising the age from 18 to 21 will do nothing but grow the market for fake IDs. Same with banning bump stocks. The issue is and always will be the proliferation of mass killing weapons in our society.
2415 2018-02-24 22:57:19 She'd rather stay in the place that puts her in stocks for dancing on a Sunday than go on adventures with a vampire hunter? #StuPick
2416 2018-02-24 22:55:47 One aspect of this story I haven't hears about is how many of us have investments in funds that include big gun companies. I have just reviewed my 401k and moved funds out of vanguard and blackrock due to gun stocks @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 @CNN @MSNBC @TeaPainUSA @VelshiRuhle
2417 2018-02-24 22:54:26 well, then, better make sure you join the boycott of every company in America and hunt down every NRA member. BTW, Obama allowed bump stocks to be legal honey.
2418 2018-02-24 22:53:28 The assault weapons ban was from the 30s not when Reagan brought it up. Bump stocks again NRA can deem them illegal but it has to be Congress to have them flat out banned.  Private sales account for a very small percentage of gun sales.
2419 2018-02-24 22:53:19 Curious to see how much @NRA membership goes up and the decline of stocks of companies that no longer affiliate with them. The silent majority spoke once and they will speak again. #ProudNRAmember
2420 2018-02-24 22:51:51 The NRA have shown zero interest in stopping the absolute loons getting guns and shooting up schools, claiming it would lead to gun laws. This is what they get, for not even entertaining a ban on things that are very clearly designed to evade the law on automatics - bump stocks.
2421 2018-02-24 22:50:42 I think you miss the point where the 2nd amendment is a broad thing that guarantees you’re right to a firearm but laws can limit things like mag size/bump stocks/etc. I mean if you’re really cool with telling kids in a school their right to live a happy life is not worth your gun
2422 2018-02-24 22:49:36 And how can you logically think that bump stocks, an item that drastically increases the rate of fire of semi-automatic rifles (and turning them into automatic rifles) has nothing to do with it? It's basic arithmetic...
2423 2018-02-24 22:49:20 Was a customer never again United!! Watch your stocks plummet!

2426 2018-02-24 22:48:03 Did you see the super stocks tyres  last year? They were shredded
2427 2018-02-24 22:47:29 My guy, I never said mass shootings wouldn't happen if we banned AR-15's and bump stocks. But if you deny the fact that people like Stephen Paddock would have been able to hurt anywhere near as many people with a handgun, I seriously worry about your critical thinking.
2428 2018-02-24 22:45:41 LT COL. Ralph Peters. As a LT COL, you should know an AR - 15 is no different than a semi automatic hunting rifle with a magazine. Also AR does not stand for Assault Rifle and you spoke about "Bump Stocks" you should also know this rapid fire can be created by using Rubber bands.
2429 2018-02-24 22:45:40 To buy companies or stocks? This same scenario played out in 1996-2000. Plenty of value investors waited on the sidelines in 1996 and 1997 but couldn't wait it out for years, under performing.

2432 2018-02-24 22:44:24 @RepTedDeutch Hey moron bump stocks doesn’t make a weapon automatic but when you think from the end that you sit on anything is possible
2433 2018-02-24 22:39:44 me if it had loads of patterns in it and some CCs and some stocks you put on your headers :)
2434 2018-02-24 22:39:19 John, please do your research. The LV guy was shooting at 600 rounds per minute with multiple AR-15's. None were automatic, all were outfitted with $80 bump stocks. That's 1800 rounds in 3-minutes.
2435 2018-02-24 22:39:00 “Rifle bullets are typically travelling faster than 2,000 feet per second. They’re supersonic.” 

And teachers should have handguns? Nah. This is logistically idiotic. This diversion is stupid. 

Ban assault rifles. Ban bump stocks. Ban large capacity magazines. #GunControlNow

2440 2018-02-24 22:37:22 About half of US households have zero exposure to the stock market: no stocks, no mutual funds, no 401(k), no IRA, nothing.
2441 2018-02-24 22:37:20 You freely talk about Bump Stocks because the NRA doesn't care about them. No good. Ban Assault Weapons. Or is the $31 million you took from the @NRA holding you back?
2442 2018-02-24 22:37:10 The first surprise: A big slice of the US stock market isn’t American at all. Foreigners own about 35% of US stocks by value—and their ownership grew considerably over the last few decades.
2443 2018-02-24 22:35:35 Liquor is 21, voting should be 21, Owning Guns should be 21.   Beer should be 18.  Driving should be 16.  Cigarettes should be 35.   End Bump Stocks.   Excuse HIPAA laws only for Gun purchases.
2444 2018-02-24 22:35:25 Aquaculture demand is only growing, fish stocks will be in unrecoverable levels soon.
2445 2018-02-24 22:35:12 According to research by New York University economist Edward Wolff, some 84% of the stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.

2448 2018-02-24 22:32:44 As someone who supports common sense gun control, I want you to know that I like and support your ideas of raising the age that a person can purchase a gun to 21, the banning of bump stocks, and having a more solid background check system.  Let's get it done!
2449 2018-02-24 22:31:38 I don’t use Hertz. Too expensive and now NRA revolt. Watch your stocks

2457 2018-02-24 22:28:37 @Ryan_Deitsch @amjoyshow  Ryan, I loved you on Joy Reid today! Raising the age limit & banning bump stocks are crumbs to avoid the real issue. We know what we need to do: A generous gun buyback and then a banning of ARs. Period.  #GunControlNOW

2460 2018-02-24 22:27:56 But apparently in #Florida pornography is a Heath risk  

AR-15 clearly not so!

Maybe they have Mistresses with Bump-stocks in Florida? 
#Neveragain
2461 2018-02-24 22:27:53 My opinion is this; I agree that rifles shouldn't be able to be purchased until the age of 21, but Bump Fire Stocks are not considered a fully automatic weapon. They simulate it but are not considered automatic. An actual fully automatic "assault" weapon produces...#EmmaGonzales
2462 2018-02-24 22:26:11 Kylie Jenner tweet once saying she doesn't really open snapchat anymore and the snapchat stocks went down by 7% which is 1 bill dollars worth to them HOW, fucking hell

Mais habituellement, j'ai les infos des vendeurs qui reçoivent les stocks et après seulement c'est mis en vente sur le site.
2468 2018-02-24 22:25:01 The #NRA is right in there 3rd paragraph. Some of the responsibility is not their's; however, lobbying Congress to have weapons like the AR15 (and bump stocks) remain legal does make them accountable for a significant aspect of the #FloridaSchoolShooting tragedy
2469 2018-02-24 22:24:44 @AliVelshi Banning bump stocks like closing barn door after horse has left. Day after Las Vegas shootings all web sites selling bump stocks sold out. #passrealguncontrol
2470 2018-02-24 22:24:36 @JeffBezos 
As a shareholder I find your resistance to get rid of NRATV morally irresponsible and harmful to company stocks. #takeaction
2471 2018-02-24 22:22:18 Push for laws that ban bump stocks. Push for laws that limit the number is firearms a single person can possess )with the exception of antiques). Push for laws that regulate the amount is ammunition a single person can possess.
2472 2018-02-24 22:19:34 The fight EVERY measure of regulation. Assault rifle bans, bump stocks, bio-triggers, eliminating private sales, gun show loophole, national registry, magazine size, licensing for mentally ill. Name one regulation they've relented on since the 60s that didn't include Reagan
2473 2018-02-24 22:19:30 I hope these companies are receiving as many emails, calls, and letters from gun owners as they did the left.  Man, they are sure making things political; the companies that is.  I will be watching their stocks.
2474 2018-02-24 22:19:28 I think universal background checks and age limits would be the easiest starting points. Smaller magazines. Ban bump stocks or any other device that mimics automatic. I don't expect to prevent the determined mass shooter, but killing 7 is better than killing 17.
2475 2018-02-24 22:17:27 But my bump stocks..
2476 2018-02-24 22:17:07 I don’t know about any other industry but any company in the travel industry will definitely not take a hit in terms of stocks even if individuals boycott. Hertz so many corporate contracts which won’t be impacted at all. So they lose one account, drop in the bucket.
2477 2018-02-24 22:15:54 During an uptrend stocks correct... and you may trade the dip...

Likewise, during a correction....a bounce could be a good buy

And in both cases you've to keep stoplosses ..

Don't find anything contradictory... 
2478 2018-02-24 22:15:39 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
2479 2018-02-24 22:15:03 Bump stocks are a convenient way avoiding with the problem of the destructive nature of the weapon itself.
2480 2018-02-24 22:14:15 They only want your guns. That's the only solution for the bought and paid for. Go ahead look into bump stocks, meds, states notifying Fed, Fed failures, but they don't. Why is that? Cause they don't really want a solution, just your guns.
2481 2018-02-24 22:14:10 Haven’t you heard? The one where we ban scary looking  “assault rifles” because they are absolutely the most superior firepower out there and no other gun can compare with them.  Oh and bump stocks... that will solve everything.
2482 2018-02-24 22:13:46 NewsWatch: Here’s Warren Buffett’s ‘strongest argument’ against buying stocks with borrowed money
2483 2018-02-24 22:13:27 In the past 24 hours I have sold thousands in mutual funds that hold gun related stocks.  I have placed buy orders to replace them on Monday with gun free funds in the same asset class.
2484 2018-02-24 22:11:41 People who fight to NOT change gun laws because of 2nd Amendment forget that having free speech in the 1st Amendment does not mean you can shout "Fire" in a crowded place.  Laws should protect, especially children.  Ban AR-15s & bump stocks!  Raise age of gun ownership to 21!!!!
2485 2018-02-24 22:10:55 @maddow @JoyAnnReid @RobReiner @TheLastWord I am positive Trump laundered millions for the Oligarchs. Mueller ordered Page and Manafort to forfeit ALL Real Property, Jewels, furniture, cash, stocks, bonds etc. Trump will be required to do same if convicted.
2486 2018-02-24 22:10:40 If it dosent brkout...and yields reverse down...thn...50% crash in stocks coming...
2487 2018-02-24 22:10:32 The bump stocks etc basically make it full auto, that and the issue of high velocity of bullets, which do massive internal damage as opposed to 9mm....that’s the issue!
2488 2018-02-24 22:10:32 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
2489 2018-02-24 22:10:27 Banning bump stocks is like ordering a butterscotch s’mores sundae atop a Boston Cream donut with bacon sprinkles and asking them to hold the cherry.
2490 2018-02-24 22:10:17 Snapchat stocks just dropped by a billion $ because one of the @Kardashians said they don’t use it anymore  why tf are they even still relevant is my question
2491 2018-02-24 22:10:11 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2492 2018-02-24 22:09:43 The NRA has nothing to do with this fiasco. Law enforcement screwed up big time. Health care screwed up big time. Trump has pushed for no bump stocks, better getting & raising the age. What have you offered? Come on, let's work together and fix this
2493 2018-02-24 22:09:13 His comments on bump stocks worry me a bit honestly, but he's still a relief after the disaster that Obama was.
2494 2018-02-24 22:08:54 My rights to an ar-15 are my rights and has nothing to do with the importance of life, ban them and mass shootings will happen with any other gun.. second automatic rifles have not been legal for any civilian for years, look it up. Third banning bump stocks means nothing...
2495 2018-02-24 22:08:37 En même temps, c'était plus de la pollution urbaine qu'autre chose. Une ville c'est pas le Far West où chaque commerçant dépose ses stocks partout où il le souhaite sur la voie publique dans la gabegie la plus complète !
2496 2018-02-24 22:08:34 In addition to backing removing the restrictions for the mentally ill to buy guns, opposing banning bump stocks & assault weapons, whose ONLY purpose is to kill PEOPLE...as many as possible, as quickly as possible.  Even dead kids are acceptable to the NRA so long as it makes $.
2497 2018-02-24 22:08:20 Could it be because this is about more than just the one shooting? Why does any civilian need an AR-15? High-capacity magazines? How about bump-stocks like used in the Vegas shooting? We need change in this country. The PD's failures are being reported and stressed too though.

Major Shift Warns of Further British Pound Weakness
DailyF…
2499 2018-02-24 22:08:01 Dear Morons, Trump is willing to intensify background checks, raise the legal age for owning a firearm, and outlaw bump stocks. He’s handing you a gift. This is DACA all over again. How are you so determined to hate him that you’ll ignore policies you’ve been pushing for years?
2500 2018-02-24 22:07:52 People close to my neighborhood have been shooting rifles with bump stocks and AR-15s all day long 'just for fun' but it's still scary for the kids around here just hearing the constant gunfire and it's a little insensitive and annoying to everyone. Why do people do this for fun?
2501 2018-02-24 22:07:12 The @NRA is being "punished" due to their involvement in opposing common sense gun safety laws for years. The NRA should have been leading the fight FOR these safety laws. Civilians don't need bump stocks or high capacity magazines. WAKE UP.  Enough is enough. #BoycottNRA
2502 2018-02-24 22:06:56 If no automatic rifles (nor bump stocks) were available- less people would be killed in mass shootings. Full stop.
Ban automatic rifles.
2503 2018-02-24 22:06:52 I come from rural farming backgrounds on both sides.I don't think the US will ever give up rifles&handguns. No one wants to be the Clutter family from "In Cold Blood." BAN civilians from buying automatic assault weapons, body armor, body-piercing bullets, bump stocks! #GunControl

2505 2018-02-24 22:06:23 I’m for mandatory safe storage when loaded gun is accessible by kids; I’m for red-flag laws for domestic violence, hate crime convicts, relevant mental health issues; bump stocks should be regulated same as automatic since they are designed to artificially speed rate of fire /1
2506 2018-02-24 22:06:15 Exactly.. some friends look at me with that look like your not risking your money on trading stocks and Forex are you. They all have a story of someone who tried that and lost all.. trading FX is the hardest thing I ever did Love it and your neg connotations won't change my mind

2508 2018-02-24 22:04:42 Nop. I just said why gun-people bought bump stocks. It has nothing to do with imitating the shooter. But I just saw you'r from Australia, I don't expect you to understand the first thing about guns. You probably think cops should shoot the legs.
2509 2018-02-24 22:04:40 1. These are illegal. 2. He wants to raise minimum age to get guns (less people will have guns). 3. He wants to ban bump stocks. 4. Get your old, uneducated, hammer head bead looking ass of this app.
2510 2018-02-24 22:04:28 #stocks#StockMarketCrash  If you're a 20 something you should be an aggressive equity investor no matter what the economy is like. Ideally, the best time to pig out on stocks is just after a major depression. But can you bring yourself to do this when the world is panicking?
2511 2018-02-24 22:03:32 Decided to act like an adult, for a moment, and bought a few stocks last week.  I am now a dollarnaire!
2512 2018-02-24 22:03:27 They LIE & #FAKEnews reports their LIES as TRUTH !
They come up with "facts" that are flat out LIES !
They conveniently forget it was Bary who approved "bump stocks" !
They probably own guns themselves but will never admit to it.
After Giffords was shot, her hubby bought guns !

2515 2018-02-24 22:03:16 LRT THIS IS THE THING I'VE BEEN YELLING ABOUT. Most "assault weapon bans" are basically versions of the 1994 one. They just ban specific *features*, leaving ridiculous loopholes. Look thumbhole stocks up to see what I mean. Regulation has to be comprehensive and general.
2516 2018-02-24 22:03:07 I already talked to you on live chat - you just said "sorry but it's only available while stocks last". There was no T&Cs on the offer, no warning that it was out of stock. It's still up now.
2517 2018-02-24 22:02:55 And in the same sentence after establishing who the people were (non-gun people), you said that they were bought more. 
If it was gun lovers who bought the bump stocks after Vegas, then my original point was correct.

2524 2018-02-24 22:00:47 The NRA should announce banning all semi and automatic rifles including bump stocks. Everyone would be stunned. Remember the Black Market always had anything illegal. Just sayin’.  What are they afraid of?! And why are they tax exempt?? Huh??
2525 2018-02-24 22:00:16 LOL... Amazon knows you actually had the purchase power.. Not only will Amazon see their stocks rise but thousands are now joining the NRA... You are the minority not the majority... #2A #NRA
2526 2018-02-24 21:59:51 ...but max pain was for a short squeeze on Friday and max pain for next week would be new lows if they allow stocks to catch up to credit...
2527 2018-02-24 21:59:09 And as a reminder to everyone on this thread, bump stocks are still currently legal and not even regulated by the NFA
2528 2018-02-24 21:58:17 Sell these stocks now!
2529 2018-02-24 21:58:12 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.

2530 2018-02-24 21:58:07 Starting to watch $blgv very closely. Of 130 stocks woth pot exposure, it is off its high the most. A whopping 75 percent! Chart still looks like it could retrace a little more, but can't argue that an entry point is forming
2531 2018-02-24 21:56:59 Bump Stocks make any semi automatic shoot and operate like a fully automatic. That’s a great first step in my opinion.
2532 2018-02-24 21:56:46 Shorting stocks is un-patriotic, which of course is why they charge more to do it. Buy an index fund and chill. Just ask Warren.

2539 2018-02-24 21:55:10 Why would gun haters buy up bump stocks in anticipation of a ban?
Seems like an odd statement to make.
2540 2018-02-24 21:54:13 Oh is that why the sales sky-rocketed ?  The inquiries were made by non-gun people as every gun person knows what it is, and the sales sky-rocketed in anticipation of a ban on bump stocks. Are you really this dumb ?
2541 2018-02-24 21:53:38 Mass shooting have increased dramatically since the assault rife ban was lifted in 2004. Explain that? Stronger background checks is a start but heavy regulations need to be in place for assault rifles, ammo and add on’s like bump stocks and drum clips.
2542 2018-02-24 21:53:34 You are an NRA stooge.  Bump stocks should have been illegal after the Vegas shooting. You need a comprehensive database for the background checks to work. No "Gun Show" loophole. You need to ban semi-automatic weapons. #DoNothing #LiarInChief #NRAStooge
2543 2018-02-24 21:52:34 As for glamorizing shooters, that's something gun lovers do. 
Enquiries on, and sales of, bump stocks rose after Vegas, as many gun lovers sought to mimic the shooter's arsenal.
2544 2018-02-24 21:52:10 Snapchat stocks / shares went down 1.4billion from the kylie Jenner tweet 
2545 2018-02-24 21:51:50 Don't fuck with bump stocks
2546 2018-02-24 21:50:44 I'm not against the 2nd. I'm for common sense. No one needs an AR15, bump stocks and multiple round magazines. Im a gun owner. It took our military 23 days to get into Baghdad. You think our measly guns are going to defeat them?
2547 2018-02-24 21:50:44 cancels out the effectiveness of banning bump stocks. I just think it’s a losing argument for both sides, and net effect is going to be to drive people further apart.
2548 2018-02-24 21:50:25 I also believe that gun possession should not be allowed for those who have committed domestic abuse or felonies. Additionally, I support a ban on bump stocks. The current proliferation of guns is a threat to public safety and free political debate.
2549 2018-02-24 21:50:24 But again, suspected terrorists owning guns, you're ok with that? military style rifles and bump stocks just to defend yourself? make sense?
2550 2018-02-24 21:49:43 You’re banning bump stocks because you say they turn guns into machine guns.  So why not ban machine guns?  Hmmm?  Answer?  Only one:  NRA/Russia owns you.    Hilarious that a so-called “self made man” is so totally owned and manipulated by others.
2551 2018-02-24 21:49:35 Stand strong? “America Reacts
While liberals applauded Trump’s move to ban bump stocks and tighten checks, many conservatives saw it as a betrayal. Conservative/libertarian social media outlet Gab was full of posts by pro-gun Americans expressing concern.”- Conservative Institute
2552 2018-02-24 21:48:39 I think when Obama’s ATF Ok’d bump stocks for guns years ago it kinda ended your narrative mate
2553 2018-02-24 21:48:29 Wow,every level of government failed in preventing the tragedy,first off.Stop deflecting&recognize the common weapon used in all mass murders in our country,Semi automatic weapons of war&devices that converted them into one like bump stocks.Blaming everyone is not resolving that!
2554 2018-02-24 21:48:25 Bump stocks are a novelty. Only one instance has it ever been used. Even if outlawed it will have 0% impact on crime. If you want to shoot at me please use a bump stock. Helps to fire a lot of ammo with zero accuracy.
2555 2018-02-24 21:48:17 For one, bump stocks.
2556 2018-02-24 21:47:34 being sick sucks...cant leave my bed...lcbo stocks dropping this week :(

2564 2018-02-24 21:42:24 Lmao Snapchat lost 1.3 billion in stocks since the update... still not enough for them to go back
2565 2018-02-24 21:42:09 Eh?  Bump stocks are automatic weapons.  I don't see why we should allow low-quality machine guns but disallow well-designed ones.  Both should be restricted to dealers/ranges/etc.
2566 2018-02-24 21:41:36 هو في تاريخ عشان ينتهي 
2567 2018-02-24 21:41:06 Or bump stocks or any other kind of modification to these weapons.  Lots of moving parts to this problem
2568 2018-02-24 21:40:32 What's wrong with it? Well first, there's no ammo. Second, the barrel's together might rub and ding each other. Third you might get an obstruction. The wood on the stocks needs polishing. Ummmmm, did I miss anything? Oh wait, I found Waldo!!!!

2574 2018-02-24 21:37:36 Because whst is happening with stocks on an aggregate net summation of large sample size in the “now” provides contextual clues as to what an index is likely to do NEXT
2575 2018-02-24 21:37:36 Trump has already signed an order to push the ban for bump stocks. He has said he would like there to be a bipartisan deal on background checks. He has said he is willing to try and raise the age for semi-automatic weapons like AR-15. These are facts.
2576 2018-02-24 21:37:05 Your point? You've never heard me say anything negative about gun ownership, have you. The hue & cry now is really about high-cap mags & AR-15 bump-stocks. Had the government emphasized mental health care, Nikolas Cruz would definitely have gotten help, through school or police.
2577 2018-02-24 21:36:36 The general public never heard of bump stocks before the Vegas shooting. They weren't used at previous (or recent) shootings, AFAIK.
2578 2018-02-24 21:34:42 Hi @ProCookUK - can I buy a replacement 1.5l glass for my cafetiere ? Your website only stocks up to 1l ? Thanks
2579 2018-02-24 21:33:51 Trump and Rick Scott are doing the same thing. Pretending to want no bump stocks, raise age.  In reality both Trump and Rick Scott know that what they say has to be turned into a bill and passed by their Republican legislators. Both know, no chance of passing.
2580 2018-02-24 21:33:42 You mean under Trump? Actually he has made a proposal. He wants to ban bump stocks. Something the NRA has already said a, while back, that they would support. Which also had nothing to do with this shooting. Next ignorant comment?
2581 2018-02-24 21:33:16 this time next week i’ll tell you which stocks have worked for me so far.. this week was a good week overall tho
2582 2018-02-24 21:33:12 Oh, just bump those stocks already!
2583 2018-02-24 21:32:47 Bump stocks do not make those rifles automatic.  Hey bump stock simply moves the motion required to pull the trigger from your finger to your arms as you must pull back on the weapon every time it is fired. It still requires a motion for each round discharged.
2584 2018-02-24 21:32:35 Semi auto ban is never gonna happen and is really inciting civil war talk. Trump wants bump stocks illegal (NRA also supports) so let's push Congress to make it happen. Add mental health checks to NICS also. Now we need to focus on protection.
2585 2018-02-24 21:32:27 Right now all we want to hear from you is how you’re coming along on the legal age to buy a firearm, banning Bump Stocks etc.  we want a confirmation!
2586 2018-02-24 21:31:50 Yes, well, you're totally right.

It's not your fault that some politicians enable our Twitter fingers as if equipped with bump-fire stocks.

2597 2018-02-24 21:27:13 Dems filibustered legislation proposed by Grassley and Cornyn to strengthen background checks. Also, the NRA was one of the first to publicly ask the ATF to look into regulations on bump stocks.

2599 2018-02-24 21:26:08 They ARE allowed to fish in British waters. There are agreed fishing quotas (to protect stocks) between EU countries. It’s not difficult to check the rules and agreements in place between countries. Fish also migrate widely so there’s no such thing as British fish.
2600 2018-02-24 21:25:01 So there were gun stocks in  past?
2601 2018-02-24 21:24:47 Add bump stocks to list of modifications banned in this country, strengthen background checks, allow CDC to study gun violence, close loopholes for gun show/straw man sales. Those four tactics have bipartisan support, can get done now, and will be more effective than gun ban.
2602 2018-02-24 21:24:46 She made a comment that she no longer uses Snapchat because she didn't like the new design. After that comment, stocks for snap went down & they lost 1.2b. Women empowerment.

2604 2018-02-24 21:24:15 do you think assumption that the album production/stocks depends on preordering early vs towards near the release is true?

2608 2018-02-24 21:23:02 Most of that stuff is already federal law, contrary to popular belief. Automatic weapons have been completely illegal for deacades. Mandatory background checks even longer. Bump stocks soon to be added to the list with Trump's order.
2609 2018-02-24 21:22:52 Restrictions on the usage of assualt rifles and bump stocks are far less costly than arming teachers who mostly do not want to be armed at schools where parents don't want armed teachers.
2610 2018-02-24 21:22:27 I’m not sure what “stricter” or “more sensible” gun laws even means. Bump stocks and background checks is playing around on the margins. Anything less than a TOTAL BAN ON ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS is weak tea bullshit. #NoMoreNRAPoliticians

2617 2018-02-24 21:19:22 Agree on Bump Stocks and Platform for real time sharing of data between agencies. 

GVRO is a great idea if implemented properly. 

Domestic Violence Information needs to be shared with all agencies as well. Is the Lautenberg Amendment not being applied as designed?

2621 2018-02-24 21:15:21 Remember: Investing in cryptocurrencies is a lot like investing in traditional securities (stocks, bonds, t-bills, etc) one can make money, but one can also lose money. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. There is always a risk of loss.
2622 2018-02-24 21:15:04 No autos, no big mags, no bump stocks, limits on amounts, required gun safes, background checks, lifting ban on gun violence research, the list is long
2623 2018-02-24 21:14:34 #dotard said they will act after #Parkland and so far, one of his first wonderful ideas, arming teachers, he will leave up to the States.  And bump stocks will be up to Rep controlled Congress.  And universal background checks will be the same.  That’s leadership, behind everyone

Parents can’t give her a gun cause they’d be “sraw” purchasers - a felony. Bump stocks= legal. Now not? #MAGA
2625 2018-02-24 21:13:12 You lie. Its bullets travel at 3000 fps (feet per second) not 2000 miles per hour, and it only fires 1 bullet per trigger pull. You can keep the bump stocks. Those things are trash and every real rifleman knows it. Waste of money.
2626 2018-02-24 21:11:38 Ordered Japanese brand plastic wrap all the way from Japan...and then discovered my local teeny-weeny Nijiya stocks it... #LifesIronies
2627 2018-02-24 21:11:14 Give teachers ar-15’s with bump stocks, fight fire with fire
2628 2018-02-24 21:11:13 Except when stocks dropped.  That was trump. And when they rise again... that was Obama.  . #liberallogic
2629 2018-02-24 21:11:11 Here are the three big things you need to know:  
           1.      When  the unemployment rate is low, with more folks finding jobs (like  today), stocks tend to bring in terrible returns going forward.
2630 2018-02-24 21:11:07 It's amazing how several generations went to school without armed teachers. Why? Because the public wasn't armed with military style weapons, bump stocks or extended magazines. EVERY child has a right to go anywhere without being afraid they'll be shot.
2631 2018-02-24 21:10:52 David, y’all are amazing! Please be specific-the time is now. Demand #AssaultWeaponsBan no more large capacity magazines, no bump stocks, no silencers! Institute “red flag” gun laws & mandatory training before licensing. Majority of country in favor-stay strong! @cameron_kasky
2632 2018-02-24 21:10:47 Sell your Postmates stocks now!!!
2633 2018-02-24 21:10:24 No Ban on Bump Stocks. 
No Raising Age to 21.
2634 2018-02-24 21:09:35 More. Allot of people didn't have access to stocks during the dot coms.  Crypto can reach anyone anywhere anytime 24/7 in any amount using basically any device. Look for 20x, easily.
2635 2018-02-24 21:09:29 My stance is that I’m good with the ban of bump stocks, raising the age to 21, 3-5 day waiting period but background checks are immediate, making sure every state enters every person that’s prohibited and if states fail to enter persons that are prohibited they’re penalized.
2636 2018-02-24 21:08:59 Absolutely...ive been buying myself last week especially for my long term portfolio. Miners and energy stocks some the few value plays left now in my opinion
2637 2018-02-24 21:08:08 Fascinating that @FedEx is still the hold out here. How many guns, gun parts, bump stocks, paraphernalia,  etc are they shipping? 

They have to know because they have both package manifests and x-ray screening.
2638 2018-02-24 21:06:56 @Lawrence It’s time for the Dems to craft an effective message on the republican tax cut. I suggest they call for a repeal of the tax cuts for the rich and giving more to the middle class. On guns call for a ban on bump stocks and AR’s.
2639 2018-02-24 21:06:48 Perhaps the gun companies will stop offering the wrong guns to the civilian base to avoid having their stocks tank!
2640 2018-02-24 21:06:47 I'm having such a great day it's like finding out one of your stocks split while your at the Playboy mansion.
2641 2018-02-24 21:06:33 You are amazing! If you need more help (someone to livestream, iTunes, etc?) let us know. And, please make specific requests —call for what you know what prevent tragedies like this again #AssaultWeaponsBan -no more large capacity magazines, no bump stocks, #NoMoreDeadKids 
2642 2018-02-24 21:06:19 ~Susan effective February 24, I have joined the NRA.  WHOOP! WHOOP! And will refuse to rent cars from Avis and Budget. You might consider looking at Target’s stocks and realize that it doesn’t pay to try and hold Americans hostage. #GetSmart
2643 2018-02-24 21:05:21 Never did forex...i did penny stocks. Some coins behave just like OTC...but I do agree is s lot easier to trade cryptos
2644 2018-02-24 21:04:56 i really wanted a tesla 3 this year but maybe i was pretty far down the list anyways...i think ill stick to stocks from now on. something safe and requires zero effort.
2645 2018-02-24 21:04:46 JNJ & VZ are the stocks i like most
2646 2018-02-24 21:04:14 Hey, @Visa, @Mastercard, & @AmericanExpress Do not allow your services to be used by retailers that sell assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.  You can make a difference. You can keep America safe.
2647 2018-02-24 21:04:07 9 stocks reporting #earnings this week have beaten estimates for the last 12 quarters, including $ADI, $ENDP, $EBIX and $PCLN. Would you rely on these to earn you #freestocks in the #EarningsGame? Use referral code TwitterJester to get free shards when you join!
2648 2018-02-24 21:04:07 Eek! I hadn’t even considered booze stocks! *racestoshops*. Mon it is, please deliver rural isolation and weeks off school....Not too much to ask eh 
2649 2018-02-24 21:04:03 I just saw a video on bump stocks and honestly it's even crazier than i thought. At first thought I was like "WOW this is insanely cool" then I thought "well what if these get into the wrong hands?!" Very destructive, it fired so much faster than I thought it would really.
2650 2018-02-24 21:03:13 My stocks really SOARED!
2651 2018-02-24 21:02:49 I don’t think Bogle would take the bait. WB prob wouldn’t give you much either. He did make the famous Jackson Hole speech as tech bubble was inflating. But it’s not like he was telling ppl to avoid US stocks altogether.
2652 2018-02-24 21:02:28 Who is boycotting ? I’m a gun owner and I want to keep the second amendment so I will be joining the NRA. I had enough of politicians talking about guns, bump stocks , semi auto weapons , and seen what the NYS safe gun act did is total ignorant nonsense, moronic at best!
2653 2018-02-24 21:02:02 All these companies cutting ties with NRA should also instruct their pension/401k etc to divest all holdings in gun stocks
2654 2018-02-24 21:01:46 Those companies stocks will drop like target.  It's there own suicide
2655 2018-02-24 21:01:15 Bump stocks should be banned because they undermine the full auto ban we already have in place, but bump stocks are not exclusively for AR-15s which is why banning the AR-15 won't address the issue of maniacs buying guns legally or otherwise.
2656 2018-02-24 21:00:54 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
2657 2018-02-24 21:00:53 Investment tip: Kleenex stocks. But buy buy. 

HerDaim SiyahBeyazAşk
2658 2018-02-24 21:00:24 Because the @NRA refuses to do anything about mass shootings or even ban bump stocks etc.
2659 2018-02-24 20:59:36 Stocks and shopping went down. Go to google, type in Target, look at stocks, purchase when they decided to be political.

2678 2018-02-24 20:53:31 Say Hello to the Blockchain in Transport Alliance and Its 10 Brand-Name Members | Business Markets and Stocks News
2679 2018-02-24 20:52:50 Those of us opposed to the NRA and the carnage they promote vastly outnumber the "hardened millions" of gun nuts. We're not stopping with the corporations; it all leads to the politicians who write the laws that allow unfettered access to AR15s and bump stocks.
2680 2018-02-24 20:52:49 $AMZN & $NFLX already at new ATHs since market corrected.. $AMZN up ~170% in last 2yr’s rally
$NFLX up over 200%.
Strongest stocks in the strongest sectors of a bull market are excellent lead indicators for the broader market $SPY watch $XLK & strong industries $SOXX $SOCL $SKYY
2681 2018-02-24 20:51:52 He hadn’t committed a crime, so what were they supposed to do? Keep 24/7 surveillance? His 2nd Amendment rights superseded public safety, period. Besides the military who needs AR-15’s, high capacity magazines and bump stocks? Nobody. You don’t need 50 rounds for one deer 
2682 2018-02-24 20:50:48 Look who’s grouping who. Keep your rifle I don’t care. I wouldn’t mind banning high capacity mags, bump stocks, suppressors. Just seems reasonable to me.
2683 2018-02-24 20:50:46 One of the first things he mentioned was increased background checks and banning things like bump stocks. Gun owners have criticised him and he's still sticking to his guns (pardon the pun). Give credit where credit is due.
2684 2018-02-24 20:50:14 Mass Shootings: Schools/Clubs/Churches/Concerts/Theaters, etc.
Bandaids: Raise Age Limit, Ban Bump Stocks, Counselors.
Epidemic/Cause: ASSAULT WEAPONS
Until epidemic/cause is addressed, we ALL remain targets & fearful of being hunted & killed. @GOP, #AssaultWeaponsBan! #Parkland
2685 2018-02-24 20:50:05 you clearly do not understand the bounds of the Second Amendment if you believe it covers assault weapons & bump stocks.
2686 2018-02-24 20:49:59 5G will make cancer treatment stocks skyrocket
2687 2018-02-24 20:49:51 I urge everyone to look into which stocks are in your 401k accounts, many widely held ETF's contain gun manufacturers. If everyone gets out of these gun manufacturers then their shareholders and CEO's will feel the finaccial pain.#nraboycott
2688 2018-02-24 20:49:37 @DavidAFrench I appreciate your thoughtful comments about gun control and GVROs. Have you written a piece outlining your thoughts about why banning bump stocks is an acceptable limit on 2A rights, but limiting magazine capacity is not? Thanks!
2689 2018-02-24 20:49:30 Sane gun laws do not give him control over guns. Banning assault weapons & bump stocks isn't taking away every gun. Or giving them to him.
2690 2018-02-24 20:49:22 REPUBLICANS ARE MAJORITY OF INVESTOR CLASS. TWO OPTIONS. 1. SELL MEDIA STOCKS TO ZERO UNLESS THEY CHANGE OR 2. BUY MORE AND CONTROL BOARD TO APPT CEO-THAT IS FAIR.
2691 2018-02-24 20:49:05 Can we all agree that killing people is bad? Yes? Good. Now can we also agree that it’s probably not the best idea to let private citizens own assault rifles and ak-47s? No? Ok then what about stricter background checks and banning numb stocks? We can’t agree on that either?
2692 2018-02-24 20:48:56 Plenty of Republicans would support banning bump stocks and clear, specific mental illness limitations. The challenge is establishing a system that allows due process before the mental illness block can be established. Without that, it will not make it through the court system.
2693 2018-02-24 20:48:34 Good, but you also need to BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. Bump stocks were not involved in the Parkland mass murders.
2694 2018-02-24 20:48:15 As you say, it’s not gonna stop. The Swiss central bank for example just print their fiat units of stuff, the rest of the world values that stuff very highly it seems. They in turn use it to buy stocks on the US stock exchange. How messed up is that! The fed do it too I’m sure.
2695 2018-02-24 20:48:10 No one suggested banning bump stocks until the Las Vegas shooting. The previous admin approved the sale of bump stocks.
2696 2018-02-24 20:48:03 Huh? 100 round drum mag? what are you talking about child? You clearly missed the point. Both guns are identical except for the plastic or wood stocks. Same rate of fire, same Mag capacity, same knockdown power. Banning AR15 they could just go out and buy another type of gun.
2697 2018-02-24 20:47:37 the coach doesn't get to choose which groceries the GM stocks the fridge with. Also, our coach has overseen the development of about half a dozen current youngsters and they're all thriving. Get a clue
2698 2018-02-24 20:46:40 No, actually, firearms manufacturers stocks SOARED under Obama. Many called him the best gun salesman in US history. 

#FactsAreABitch 
Like you George.
2699 2018-02-24 20:46:38 Let’s talk about banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and assault rifles, instead. The whole arming teachers thing is just a distraction l. How do I know this? Because it would be IMPOSSIBLE for Trump admin to implement just a ridiculousness!
2700 2018-02-24 20:45:44 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia

2702 2018-02-24 20:45:30 @SpeakerRyan : one way of keeping your speaker post is to get things done. Show leadership. Stop sending thoughts and prayers to parents. Send it to the NRA instead. Ban semi and assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines or be voted out. #NeverAgain
2703 2018-02-24 20:44:44 Wish I had a stock account I would be shorting these companies stocks big time because of this foolish move
2704 2018-02-24 20:44:38  Low-income people and other persons mentioned in law and in need of a home shall receive it gratis or for reasonable payment from the state, municipal and other housing stocks according to the norms fixed by law.
2705 2018-02-24 20:44:26 I'm sick of people dying.  Mass murders went down when we had an assault weapons ban. A rifle for hunting is certainly different from an AR15 and we certainly can ban bump stocks which were used in Vegas.
2706 2018-02-24 20:43:42 That's a bummer I was hoping you could short like stocks. They allowed it in a trading tournament...figured they would allow it on the markets
2707 2018-02-24 20:43:39 Actually they want tighter regulations, ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Increase the age to 21. You always mention taking away your guns, abolishing the 2nd A. Those are your tactics to inflame people. This has not been said. People are more important than guns.
2708 2018-02-24 20:43:07 So, #DonaldTrump went from *outlawing* bump stocks to letting people pick one up before they get sloppy drunk at a bar for the first time. Ah... progress. 
#TrumpFail #NRABloodMoney #FakePresident #Resist
2709 2018-02-24 20:43:05 So they have to allocate more to stocks...sounds bullish till they crack.
2710 2018-02-24 20:43:00 The amount of money is minimal compared to PP, and you wouldn’t say that PP is why Dems support abortion. And the NRA doesn’t reject all regulations a priori. For example they supported possibly banning bump stocks.
2711 2018-02-24 20:42:41 Fact 
Millenials prefer crypto to stocks!!
2712 2018-02-24 20:42:16 You really have to pause on the extreme silliness of his position, which is essentially, “I am so much more knowledgeable about guns that teh libruls”, yet he doesn’t seem to understand how devastating an unmodified AR-15 is, or that they can be modded or used with bump stocks.
2713 2018-02-24 20:42:03 yeah Im looking at Kroger just because its my grocery store and they are pretty innovative. funny how stocks were never on my radar but now because of crypto im looking into them.
2714 2018-02-24 20:40:20 BTC #bitcoin trading weak... probably a leading indicator for #stocks
2715 2018-02-24 20:40:19 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2716 2018-02-24 20:39:35 Baker Act wouldn’t have applied to Cruz who was never involuntarily committed. True AR-15 is technically the little brother of the production fully automatic M-16 that my dad & brother used in the military, but w/bump stocks & less weight AR is deadlier
2717 2018-02-24 20:39:15 An AR15 is not any faster than any other semi rifle or pistol. I agree that bump stocks can let you fire them faster and I don’t think we need them. It’s not as powerful of a round than most rifle round and many pistol round. It’s a gimmick by Dems to start infringement. Learn.
2718 2018-02-24 20:38:55 Even Trump & NRA are against bump stocks & they do not make it auto. So the clip size then that is the issue?  Even a handgun can hold a 15 round clip and can be switched out quickly.  Going after clip size would be more factual than going after whatever an assault weapon is.
2719 2018-02-24 20:38:39 Yeah well the useful idiots think gun laws vs armed guards at schools will protect our kids will drive gun sales through the roof along with gun manufacturers stocks. They know that too. Just posturing!
2720 2018-02-24 20:38:36 I signed up for @robinhoodapp for the #crypto but stayed for the @Tesla stocks !!
2721 2018-02-24 20:37:42 I mean Trump has already banned bump stocks hasn’t he?
2722 2018-02-24 20:37:30 Headline: Peter chiarelli stocks up on third rounders because he trades all our first and seconds for garbage. Also I'm starting to thing the Garth brooks sold out shows banner is actually a Garth snow stole banner
2723 2018-02-24 20:37:18 Nate, if I strip the tacticool plastic stock off the AR-15 put an 1879 looking wood stock on it & rename it Grannies Wild Boar Hunting Rifle would it still fall under an assault rifle ban? If not, could we enforce a ban on after market tacticool stocks from China?

2725 2018-02-24 20:36:31 NRA is American version of ISIS. Mostly funded by people who oppose guns ,but invested in 401K, pension funds, stocks  of gun companies. Please check with your investment firms and disarm NRA.
2726 2018-02-24 20:36:19 Ima keep it real w you chief, bump stocks should be illegal. If automatic guns are illegal in your state, bump stocks should be illegal.
2727 2018-02-24 20:35:34 wow time to short those stocks
2728 2018-02-24 20:35:04 There is more of us than these hypocrites that are taking sides with the Dems and stupid ppl!! I have spent most of the day writing emails and phone calls to give them hell and to drop stocks or business with them! I would say all patriots need to do the same to get them straight
2729 2018-02-24 20:33:52 You don’t know what prices things can go up or down to that’s why it’s traded if we all knew the value of things would go up we would all play the stocks
2730 2018-02-24 20:33:11 Machh I bet you know little about firearms bump stocks do not make a firearm automatic and automatics have been illegal since 1934 and 1968 the idea behind arming teachers is arming them with conceal carry pistols.
2731 2018-02-24 20:32:58 Then you got the right guy. I didn't want a guy who sold out the country for Iranian Nukes, but that's what I put up with for 8 long years. How has Trump "sold out America"? Stocks? Taxes? Military?
2732 2018-02-24 20:32:53 Oh; and Jill, most AR platform rifles come from the factory with rigid or collapsible stocks. No spring. Sorry. But the recoil is negligible as a .223 (.22) is a small but fast round.
2733 2018-02-24 20:32:11 Gay or not, I did not have sexual relations with that hot little rapid fire number with the cute bumper stocks.
2734 2018-02-24 20:31:52 Stocks = socks. -@ThomasSanders
2735 2018-02-24 20:31:35 The Parkland shooting was the fault of the FBI and local police. Current background check system would have worked if either had done their jobs.

Bump stocks are not the only way of modifying the rate of fire and can be made illegally.
2736 2018-02-24 20:31:17 Bump stocks were determined to be a gun part that the ATF *could not* regulate. That is not "approval." Also, Trump severely limited our ability to block gun sales to certain people with dangerous mental illness. He wants more guns to our gun problem. THAT'S the problem.
2737 2018-02-24 20:30:37 There is no statistically evidence that bump stocks matter, legal gun owners don't commit crimes. (The number so low it's virtually nothing.) The rest of the stuff you suggest is already done in Illinois and other states, so I don't see an issue. :D
2738 2018-02-24 20:30:30 Banning bump-stocks, and better background checks is not taking all of your precious guns.  It is this ALL or NOTHING attitude that is creating such a divide in this country and why people are now taking action against the NRA.  You should be ashamed.  I used to respect you....
2739 2018-02-24 20:30:24 First off bump stocks are not automatics second an adult is well able to think rationally as opposed to a child third Superman does not shoot people I hope you know that what I am saying is if you arm teachers they will out number a wimpy shooter deterring him from doing it
2740 2018-02-24 20:30:23 Stupid is as stupid does. Luckily, I don't have any of their stocks cause they're going to notice a decline in value next week!
2741 2018-02-24 20:29:07 @LukeMesserIN Hey DC dumb f**ks, bump stocks for the AR15 can be reclassified  as a Class 3 FFL modification attachment. Learn what the classifications are that you put in place are. Signed NRA Life Member

2746 2018-02-24 20:27:44 Here’s my query, never yet answered. DB seems fundamentally much less fair than DC - if stocks drop, someone else (later generations) must pay for the shortfall, as well as taking same hit themselves. The financial management is grotty.  But surely DC is a fairer system overall.
2747 2018-02-24 20:27:43 @realDonaldTrump, banning violent video games will do nothing but violate the First Amendment to the Constitution,  so DON'T BRING IT UP! No knee-jerk reaction ever proves satisfactory 8th 5 he long run. Bump stocks aren't the problem either.
2748 2018-02-24 20:27:09 This a distraction to get us talking about pistol packing math teachers and not about background checks, age restrictions and bans on ar, hc magazines, bump stocks.  Trump has no shame and doesn’t mind sounding stupid.
2749 2018-02-24 20:27:01 And you think a teacher will go all Clark Kent on a mf? Why not arm the kids themselves? Give 'em small automatics with bump stocks
2750 2018-02-24 20:26:45 Our Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the 2nd Amendment allows regulation on types of weapons that can be owned and who can own them. We can ban owning and selling assault rifles, bump stocks, semi-automatics, etc and our 2nd Amendment rights are still intact.

2752 2018-02-24 20:26:01 Which bill? I doubt your bill solely bans bump stocks. I’d like to read exactly what else your proposing in this bill. My trust in you and other politicians is lacking. You’re all magicians. Look here, meanwhile we are actually doing this.

2755 2018-02-24 20:25:16 Teenagers have:

2761 2018-02-24 20:23:46 I agree! Knives most certainly can not cause as much damage and I do believe that there are some things gun owners have that we don't need like bump stocks and 60 round ammo drums but I believe we need constructive control on guns no rash control
2762 2018-02-24 20:23:26 .@POTUS ...& psych info together in NAT'L DB.  Bump stocks & age=NO BRAINERS -opposed ONLY by gun seller lobbyist NRA. Real action? We'll see! BTW: NO gun-totting teachers.

2765 2018-02-24 20:23:21 No one wants to take your 2nd amendment right away. No ar-15's, 2 week background checks, no bump stocks or attachments to make rifles into machine guns and no mentally challenged.
2766 2018-02-24 20:23:07 At this point the republican congress is satisfied that they do something...anything.  It doesn’t matter if it really solves a problem or not.  The cowardly republican congress should have banned bump stocks 6 months ago.
2767 2018-02-24 20:22:55 It's fine. Hope Congress could pass other  suggestions from POTUS : enhance background check, ban bump stocks, raise minimum age .

2777 2018-02-24 20:18:03 Black Market, Back ally, Illegal gun dealers, So what have we missed about "Bump Stocks"??
2778 2018-02-24 20:17:41 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
2779 2018-02-24 20:17:39 ps, asking Keebler elf Sessions to figure out if bump stocks are already illegal is not the same as banning them. But nice try
2780 2018-02-24 20:17:38 There is a ban on the selling/buying of bump-stocks in the works for FL. Assault rifles are fully automatic and used by the military and sometimes LE. The semi-auto only with the longer barrel requirement of 16”min, will never be banned.
2781 2018-02-24 20:16:17 How can we make sure mentally ill people don’t get guns. Will everyone who goes to buy a gun have to have a mental evaluation first? Too costly & wont work. Bump stocks should be illegal! Automatic & semi-automatic must be illegal. The NRA should be dissolved!
2782 2018-02-24 20:16:13 Verified my AMZN Stocks!  
2783 2018-02-24 20:15:57 Finally getting around to bump stocks?  You are a real go get ‘em guy... for an NRA PUPPET, i mean
2784 2018-02-24 20:15:49 Why the fuck I can't trade Brazilian stocks?
2785 2018-02-24 20:14:50 Didn't see the waiting period info in the download. Don't agree with what I've read elsewhere on that. Also don't agree with raising the age limit. Only 2 other states have a 21 limit. Will do nothing. Bump stocks are debatable and could probably live with that. Ban not the answe
2786 2018-02-24 20:14:34 NRA hasn’t killed anyone nor broken laws but companies want to break faith and trust?
I will think twice about doing business with companies
They want to bow to #BoycottNRA?  Well how about #BoycottAgreementBreakingCompanies  - 5 to10% discount vs -100% business/stocks? 
2787 2018-02-24 20:14:19 Ending the sale of Bump Stocks-check.  Universal bckgrnd checks-check. Mental Health funding-check.  These are great steps, Mr. President.  I support legal conservation/hunting practices.  I support the choice 4 home self-defense.  Renew the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.
2788 2018-02-24 20:13:14 There is a ban on bump stocks in his proposal. The AR-15 is no different than my handgun. The difference is 18 year olds could only buy those types of guns (rifles).
2789 2018-02-24 20:12:47 So we're supposed to believe that armed teachers will protect our children, when the deputies (trained for this) wouldn't even enter the school, & protect them. How about making it more difficult for people to obtain semi automatic weapons & bump stocks? @realDonaldTrump
2790 2018-02-24 20:12:06 Sell their stocks too.
2791 2018-02-24 20:12:00 Not only stupid, but cowardly.  You don’t have the spine to stand up to the NRA and do what needs to be done. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. The people are calling for it.  We’re sick of mass shootings.
2792 2018-02-24 20:11:54 I have long wanted parents to be criminally charged when toddlers, or any children shot guns that injured or killed. I believe that type of legislation is not far behind. Once bump stocks are declared illegal, the law has to specify if the ones out there are to be taken.
2793 2018-02-24 20:11:53 I would think a higher percentage would be in favor of banning bump stocks.
2794 2018-02-24 20:11:19 Stocks plunged as The Southern Company unveiled a artificial book today.
2795 2018-02-24 20:10:24 You got Bump Stocks?? You seem like the type that would purchase that... unless you bought those Full Auto Conversion Kits?!
2796 2018-02-24 20:09:44 I've never attempted a Jerry rig cuz I got the real thing.. and I think bump stocks should be banned and have no purpose. Ok?
2797 2018-02-24 20:09:00 Ok. The answer to this is NO.

Instead, let’s ban assault weapons.
Ban bump stocks.
Improve background checks (undo the damage you did last year).
Research gun violence as a mental health problem.
2798 2018-02-24 20:08:41 A group of congresspeople should cosponsor a bill with provisions that mirror those in the Australian gun laws.  It'd be enlightening to see who is willing to cosponsor gun legislation with teeth (and who isn't).  Any milquetoast could sign on to regulation of bump stocks.
2799 2018-02-24 20:08:16 Yes but how do you define mental illness. This is going to be an easy scapegoat to get away with stripping people's right to bear arms. You're a master at being un consituinational Mr. President. Banning bump stocks is as useless as this, but this is not constitutional.

2803 2018-02-24 20:07:34 Bump stocks and devices that allow for multi volume ammo need to go
2804 2018-02-24 20:07:32 @MillenialNews If you are 18-35 and you are against bump stocks, automatic weapons, the NRA send @Fedex a little note and explain to them you are going to be here a long time and they might want to consider cutting ties with the National Rifle Assoc.
2805 2018-02-24 20:07:19 Owning the S&P 500 at a 35 P/E in 1999 at 1400-1500 would have led to you roughly doubling your money in 18 years (4% per year). If you had ability to add during either 01 or 08 drawdown your IRR would be even higher. If you have 20+ year time horizon, buy stocks.
2806 2018-02-24 20:06:39 Easily available bump stocks make it automatic. This is the kind of extreme pedantry that makes he NRA seems heartless and petty.
2807 2018-02-24 20:06:17 @seanhannity Sean we really don't need to boycott the companies dropping the NRA. What we really need to do is sell off their stocks. Then watch how fast they rethink their political positions.
2808 2018-02-24 20:06:16 I can't wait until I see your stocks plummet.  Money does talk and spends just as well with other airlines.  The NRA had nothing to do with #Parkland #BoycottDeltaAirlines
2809 2018-02-24 20:06:09 Also along with the Bump Stocks, end sale of AR15 like machine guns and their magazines.  That makes sense, so do it, and don't be afraid of the big bad wolf.

2814 2018-02-24 20:05:02 Honey, the @NRA is buying the support of corrupt politicians. I call them the Conservative Cartel. What's different now is it's becoming obvious that virtually all of the country not only supports the 2nd Amendment but also making bump stocks illegal & strong background checks.
2815 2018-02-24 20:04:09 I guess she doesn't realize the Big Weed currently has 269 stocks in that portfolio waiting to explode when the get it taken off CSA 1 and get normalization of banking regulations. Or maybe she is being actively lobbied by Big Weed?
2816 2018-02-24 20:04:06 It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk
2817 2018-02-24 20:04:00 @realDonaldTrump I love your ideas about the school shootings. Raise the age to 21, no bump stocks, absolutely mental health checks. Many of the shooters are on antipsychotic medications.
MAGA !!!
2818 2018-02-24 20:03:33 I vehemently oppose DJT but I liked his tweet where he called for getting rid of assault weapons and bump stocks. As long as the substance and or policy is correct
2819 2018-02-24 20:03:26 We should also be aware that many of our 410K plans invest heavily in gun stocks. Part of the FL Teacher Pension Fund has such investments!
2820 2018-02-24 20:02:55 Bump stocks can be added to lots of semi rifles. Banning the AR15 just means one of the other rifles will become a fav. We don't stop road fatalities by banning models of cars, but by comprehensive regs

2822 2018-02-24 20:00:43 Rifles are mainly purchased for hunting, right? There is no such thing as an assault rifle. When I bought my gun, I didn't buy it with the intent to ever have to kill someone. I had my Glock to ensure the safety of my home. Mods such as bump stocks, I don't find necessary.
2823 2018-02-24 20:00:04 This is just one economic indicator which is not enough a predictor of what the future holds for stocks. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish while we climb that wall of worry.

2826 2018-02-24 19:58:22 Drunk driving laws are already enforced with DUI's inspections. Gun laws on other hand are really not that enforced, universal background checks are not a thing, very poor screening process, military style weapons and bump stocks legal.....
2827 2018-02-24 19:57:49 @amazon Also sells bump stocks.  Time to stop buying anything from Amazon and not watch their TV/Movies until they drop the NRATV and stop selling bump stocks!

2828 2018-02-24 19:57:48 It’s about time. Better than Donny Bhoy’s way. Arm teachers watch hundreds more of our children die before we would see the errors of our ways and make changes. It’s been all white men with guns doing the killing. Still Donny Bhoy says we need more guns. He must own stocks.

2835 2018-02-24 19:53:11 And the children had nothing to protect themselves. No guns would protect them. Gun laws would protect them.

2841 2018-02-24 19:50:11 I have no issue with bump stocks being regulated with a tax stamp similar to other weapon attachments. Personally I think them more deadly and less useful than surpressors which, unlike the movies like to portray, don’t actually silence the gunshot much overall in decibels.
2842 2018-02-24 19:49:02 The NRA even supported banning of the "Bump Stocks". What happened? When a bill was actually introduced, it was expanded way beyond bump stocks and failed to reach the floor of Congress. That's why nothing gets done...
2843 2018-02-24 19:47:49 @CNN While democratic counties around the world are focussed on health care, climate change, education etc, your wonderful country is focused on bump stocks and whether to raise the age when people can purchase high caliber guns that kill dozens in a short length of time.
2844 2018-02-24 19:47:36 Mr President, your plan is flawed. How is raising the age someone that can purchase a firearm and ending the sale of bump stocks going to solve the problem? Our Second Amendment states "shall not be infringed." Stand by the United States Constitution on this one.
2845 2018-02-24 19:47:21 Today I found a shop where they sell cheap Avocados  and I’m not telling anyone. Yes, it’s finally come to this.
When you share your special places, it leads to either price hikes or stocks shortages. Like Zola said, “God for us all, guluva for himself!”
2846 2018-02-24 19:45:57 Beyond stupid comment. Taking military Type semi automatic rifles, bump stocks stocks and large magazines off the market is NOT GOING TO DO A DAMN THING TO THE CONSTITUTION. It certainly didn’t during the previous 10 year ban . Quit listening to that poison Wayne LaPierre spews.
2847 2018-02-24 19:44:42 Amateur traders want to be right. Pro traders just want to make money. #stocks
2848 2018-02-24 19:44:26 I absolutely agree the AR-15 and similar military weapons should be banned, along with bump-stocks, silencers, and any other piece of hardware that makes it easier to do murder.  A gun's purpose in civilian hands should be hunting, self-defense, and target shooting.
2849 2018-02-24 19:43:35 3/?
The "more good guys with guns" approach, etc. But simply targeting AR-15s and similar, or Bump-stocks (something that can me made with a shoestring), etc. is nothing but political hyperbole and virtue signaling. The video does a good job explaining that.
2850 2018-02-24 19:43:33 how much % overall drop should we expect in US stocks while all the dirty money gets wrung out?

I gotta admit the stuffing-cash-under-a-mattress* investment approach looks pretty attractive right about now.

2851 2018-02-24 19:43:29 The Right's failure to denounce and eradicate the Sandy Hook conspiracy nuts, the Right's resistance to outlawing the manufacture and sale of bump stocks, the Right's hiding of gun sale data thru the Tiahrt Amendment, the Right's use of fear politics that drive gun sales....
2852 2018-02-24 19:43:19 Damn; yeah I thought it was like dry stocks or something like that
2853 2018-02-24 19:43:01 How about; ban assault-style weapons & bump stocks?  How about banning people w/domestic violence abuses?  What about addressing horrific mental health services/support?  Maybe nationwide background checks?  Closing loopholes?
2854 2018-02-24 19:42:25 2016 goals: just stay above water

2855 2018-02-24 19:42:15 FIGHT BACK! How can it be the NRA's fault for the shootings when the States have the right to make their own laws on the sell of guns? I guess these companies that cut ties with the NRA should cut their business in Florida? But you know they won't do that! Sell their stocks!
2856 2018-02-24 19:42:11 Enforce current laws, no bump stocks, no magazines over 10 rounds, far stricter penalties for illegal gun possession.

2858 2018-02-24 19:41:03 So talk 2 the ATF then.. they're the org that approved the design & function of bump stocks
2859 2018-02-24 19:40:51 Sweetie, I have two Ar-15 and several guns. The NRA was for banning bump stocks after Vegas. But stay with your narrative.  What Delta is doing will not keep a child safe in school. NOT. A. THING. You are all focused on the wrong things, #FBIKnew #BackgroundChecks #Deputy

2865 2018-02-24 19:39:54 He is directing his sons to buy up stock in guns, to add to his previous order to buy the defense stocks he just funded in his budget. Son was right, all he sees is our green funneling into his pocket!!!

2867 2018-02-24 19:39:25 Well said. And just like MAC mentioned in the video, before the channel went down, the Gun Community needs to wake the heck up and the division need to stop. There are too many too stupid that they actually think giving up their bump stocks is okay. It isn't about bump stocks.

2870 2018-02-24 19:38:30 Our schools need real protection. Armed personal. If need be send in service men or woman. Stopping bump stocks only keep them from good people. Like a teacher with a gun to protect the kids. Criminals can get anything.

2873 2018-02-24 19:37:24 Comprehensive background checks is not expanded background checks. You ended mental health reporting. The NRA opposes age restrictions. Bump stocks? Too little too late on that one. We're not fooled Donald. You're doing basically nothing, and more and more people are on to you.
2874 2018-02-24 19:36:59 Consider transfer agent share structure verification biweekly. Enforce standards. One day short cover. No naked Shorting. Trip zero stocks need not be Shorted. No dilutive market makers or short BMAK VNDM VERT. Can't short on Dilution. Encourage retail only. No one tick flippers
2875 2018-02-24 19:36:24 Stronger background checks, raising age from 18 to 21, ban bump stocks, etc. ARE ALL NO BRAINERS. WE ALL KNOW THIS!!! Get over it. We need to BAN the ASSAULT WEAPONS. YOU and your sick, greedy culture are being weakened by our youth. They are fighting for their lives and future.
2876 2018-02-24 19:36:01 The 2nd amendment was made when Europe owned 3/4 of America. We had fear of being reconquered, so we needed a well regulated militia, or todays National Guard. Now, we are e most powerful nation on Earth, and ww have made alliances. There is no need for bump stocks,a pistol works

2878 2018-02-24 19:35:46 GFY.  Each of these mass shootings had an AR15 involved.  Some with bump stocks, rendering them fully automatic. Call it a sporting rifle if you like.  Nobody truly believes that crap.
2879 2018-02-24 19:35:18 Banning bump stocks is a big step in the right direction. I hope these idiots in Congress can least deliver on that and come up with a better background check/gun purchasing system.
2880 2018-02-24 19:35:12 Well when their stocks drop it will be time to buy, sit & wait for all of their do-overs
2881 2018-02-24 19:34:20 Lets be adults here .. becuase I want to ubderstand her perspective. I'll even concede this .. (1) keep fully auto illegal .. (2) ban bump stocks.. (3) raise minimum age to 25 or even 30.    But this still wont stop the motivation to kill.  Search for a solution to the problem.
2882 2018-02-24 19:33:41 A first good step would be banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.
2883 2018-02-24 19:33:28 If no BAN on any MILITARY GRADE ASSAULT WEAPONS/Bump Stocks YOUR ACTION PLAN IS WEAK. You CAN have a BAN ON SOME and still have the 2nd amend. You are just scared of the NRA.  You know who are not scared, the kids, they will be voting, & getting their family and friends to vote.
2884 2018-02-24 19:33:23 Incompetent management bowing to the @MSNBC Nazi thought police. You do not deserve our investment dollars. #stockmarket #stocks #investing
2885 2018-02-24 19:33:21 I C no evidence 2 support that Senator. Banning assault weapons & bump stocks, requiring screening of all purchasers of guns as a prerequisite 4 the sale (2 ban terrorists, violent criminals, & folks w/mental problems from buying guns) doesn't negatively impact the 2nd Amendment.
2886 2018-02-24 19:33:15 @Deishma finding it very difficult to search for investment stocks from your tweets sir as they are mixed with intraday tweets..

2888 2018-02-24 19:32:38 Guess is pushing to ban bump stocks? @POTUS #Trump & the @NRA. Get your facts straight before tweeting to the world.

Balance portfolio but GLD isn’t helping? W Buffet look for value,how do u select stocks? Plz help small investors
2890 2018-02-24 19:32:21 A short note about bump stocks: Yes, you can use them to increase the rate of fire to that approaching that of an automatic weapon. You can also achieve the same rate of fire by hooking your thumb through a suspender belt loop. Do you plan to ban suspenders and belt loops?
2891 2018-02-24 19:32:04 I’m aware that you have to add bump stocks to make it fully auto. (I’ve grown up around guns). Gun for war = designed for quick reloading/can fire dozens of rounds with accuracy and ease. Also, most obviously, if they were originally designed for war within modern times.
2892 2018-02-24 19:31:50 I also disagree with u to some extent. The LV shooting made the public knowledgeable about bump stocks.
2893 2018-02-24 19:31:26 Bumps stocks are a joke. If you ever shot one you would know you can shoot just as fast without it and more accurately.

2899 2018-02-24 19:29:47 No betrayal; banning bump stocks & raising the age is good compromise. Banning semi-autos or "assault" weapons, using bureaucratic, non-due process lists (e.g. terror), wait period longer than 3 days etc. would be "betrayal." Universal background checks would be OK in theory.
2900 2018-02-24 19:29:42 Wrong. #ArmMeWith:
- Universal background checks, no loopholes
- Ban on assault weapons
- Ban on bump stocks/similar devices
- Closed boyfriend loophole
- End of arms manufacturer immunity
- Funding of CDC research
- Implementation of Giffords Center and Everytown recommendations
2901 2018-02-24 19:29:21 I suppose it does. Though, I don't necessarily agree with President Obama's admin legalizing bump stocks.
2902 2018-02-24 19:29:20 Ah yes, the classic answering the question with a question has come.

Gun control is simply regulation of sales of firearms, involving stricter background checks and restricting certain type of guns (Trump's even planning on doing this with bump stocks). It's not a ban.
2903 2018-02-24 19:28:12 My local Barnes and Noble just closed, sadly. But we did check a bookstore that stocks tons of comics. No luck.
2904 2018-02-24 19:28:05 Bump stocks are not banned. This easily converts an AR.
2905 2018-02-24 19:28:04 If people started re-allocating their 401k, 403b, 457, 529, Roth’s from funds that have gun stocks to funds without gun stocks, that would hit the NRA hard in the wallet.
2906 2018-02-24 19:27:32 Exactly why I never use any apps for trading stocks on my phone.Never Ever.
2907 2018-02-24 19:27:03 Common ground: I’m perfectly okay with banning bump stocks.
2908 2018-02-24 19:27:02 But if we are talking about guns that shoot multiple bullets with one pull of trigger, I agree... and bump stocks, Yes! And these guns are illegal in many states, it's the bump stocks that since Vegas that have been the talk
2909 2018-02-24 19:26:25 Morgan, most handguns are semiauto. Semiautomatic hunting rifles aren't very different from semiautomatic assault rifles. You want to ban pistol grips and bump stocks,that's it,you think it will help reverse the trend? Expect more of the same, but with handguns or submachineguns.
2910 2018-02-24 19:26:07 I know what you are doing. The NRA doesn't want to ban high capacity magazines, bump stocks, or raise age to legally buy. So you are diverting to the most asinine idea possible. This is bullshit and you are chickenshit re your NRA masters.
2911 2018-02-24 19:25:19 Bruh never buy stocks from an LLP otherwise you staaaay waiting on that K1 doc for tax season #staywoke
2912 2018-02-24 19:25:18 As I saw it, as soon as FAT supporters started trolling other plays, it set the stage.  It got nasty and soon as FAT reversed they pounced.  If everybody just chills out and stops trying to talk others out of buying other stocks, we are all better off.
2913 2018-02-24 19:24:29 Waiting is what has killed every debate about common sense gun legislation. Remember how there was bipartisan support to ban bump stocks? Months later, still nothing. Extended background checks? Still nothing. This community, these survivors, had enough of inaction.
2914 2018-02-24 19:24:12 the goal is to cop some stocks by the end of the year.
2915 2018-02-24 19:24:02 Also a pressure point: contact "investor relations" found  near bottom of  most corp websites that have stocks to protect. Lost value to the stock is serious issue. FedEx stock likely to drop? maybe getting out for awhile would be wise? @cnbc @cnbci @Bpolitics @IBDinvestors
2916 2018-02-24 19:23:44 My wish list at the moment: ban bump stocks & any add-ons that increase fire power to automatic, age up to 21 & stronger background checks to include gun shows. If no full ban on automatic, maybe a 30-day hold & deeper background check. No same-day approvals.
2917 2018-02-24 19:23:21 Are you not aware of the improvement since he took office.   My stocks have gone up over $20.  Tax money, more companies coming back to America, lower employment, less regulation.  Do you not care about these improvements?
2918 2018-02-24 19:22:57 Beyond just mass shooters, now there’s guns everywhere in the school. An unhinged teacher snaps and shoots a student. A student finds it and shoots other student. 

Most of America wants less guns, no bump stocks, and more restrictions for all the reasons stated above.
2919 2018-02-24 19:22:56 It’s still a defined benifit scheme. The question remains regarding your response about how to fund your pension. Why not fund like the majority have to through pension plans invested in stocks and annuity benefits?

2921 2018-02-24 19:22:00 These chumps are making so much money on insider trading of stocks they become wealthy on a meager salary that’s why they oppose term limits
2922 2018-02-24 19:21:49 High bullet energy, readily available accessories that increase lethality; high capacity magazines, pistol grip, short stocks, recoil reducers, bump stocks, ect. 
Look at what weapons mass shooters use. They dont go for a 12 guage or 9mm. They go for an AR bc Its designed to kill
2923 2018-02-24 19:21:42 Not a new idea. Yes, it is very reasonable and I will be very interested to see if anything actually happens.

You know it looked like bump stocks were going to be easily banned after Vegas. They’re still here.
2924 2018-02-24 19:21:32 It's the weekend so I cannot call @Vanguard_Group. But I just sent them an internal message from my account asking them to divest gun stocks from their portfolios.  Next I'm contacting @Fidelity.

2925 2018-02-24 19:21:20 Might not produce any change but would be a real conversation to discuss.

Lastly high capacity magazines and  blatant manipulation of the laws with items like bump stocks should be made illegal. Being able to turn a legal weapon into an illegal one should be against the law

-People destroying their guns

2928 2018-02-24 19:20:28 I was just answering your question regarding federal-state relationship. Just because a law has not been enforced does not render it null and void. I'm open to regulating magazine size, age restrictions, mental health conditions, and bump stocks. Improved background checks .
2929 2018-02-24 19:20:21 Bump stocks / age restrictions only target Law Abiding citizens willing to defend Country.    IT's NEVER About the Tools.

2930 2018-02-24 19:19:25 I'm fine with banning bump stocks, but I'm not going to willingly sign a petition to get them banned. I'm just going to sit back and let it take its course. Bump stocks are a waste of ammo anyway.

2935 2018-02-24 19:18:32 It didn't take you long to take up the approved NRA position on how to address school shootings.  Keep your promise to work with congress on sensible gun control laws - enhanced background checks, age limits, no bump stocks.
2936 2018-02-24 19:18:08 And the best way to stop dangerous individuals from getting guns, in my opinion, is to not give them guns. Not to mention, again, that nobody is trying to take away all guns, just automatic rifles and bump stocks, in addition to comprehensive and universal background checks...

2939 2018-02-24 19:17:38 Well, crypto borrowed the concept of market cap from stocks. Currency does not have a market cap. So are you saying we should invent a new definition of market cap for crypto?

2946 2018-02-24 19:14:09 #NoSchool?
Are they going to #ban all semi-automatic rifles? If not, what's the point -- #banning bump stocks, or stocks with pistol grips, will not reverse this trend. Part of the problem is that the FL protesters have been commandeered by the #left, tasked with securing a #ban.

2948 2018-02-24 19:13:27 Ban AR 15's and all assault guns and bump stocks. Guns in the classrooms is an idiotic idea just like the person that suggested it!
2949 2018-02-24 19:13:00 Cnn poll says 53% of Americans support banning bump stocks. Who the hell are these 47%?????
2950 2018-02-24 19:12:44 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2951 2018-02-24 19:11:21 Slippery slope rationale is silly here. We already have bans on certain sorts of weapons. They could ostensibly be extended to semiautomatic assault rifles, magazine sizes, bump stocks, etc.
2952 2018-02-24 19:10:58 He just said in a email he plans to raise the age for purchasing a weapon, and banning bump stocks.
2953 2018-02-24 19:10:51 This is Insane @realDonaldTrump We don't want Teachers armed!  we need to ban Assualt rifles, ban bump-stocks,  better screening to buy guns & mental health screenings!   STOP BEING A PUPPET OF THE NRA!
2954 2018-02-24 19:10:41 These were no mafia. Considering US Law, never all these were unlawful assemble. Those were meant for sale stocks. A company always need rising experiences amidst budget disturbances.
2955 2018-02-24 19:10:19 Interesting in $BRK.A @WSJ article that Berkshire Hathaway cap gains on stocks would be taxed at 21% rate under #Trump tax law rather than old 35% rate. Yet another accelerator of bear market when it arrives - take gains under current tax regime before Dems take congress.
2956 2018-02-24 19:09:31 A reasonable common sense change is appropriate. Mental illness is a recurring issue with these gun violence attacks. All states must require criminal and mental health background checks. 5 day wait period. Ban bump stocks if identified person gets charged with felony

2960 2018-02-24 19:08:11 Do you even know what a bump stock is? If you’re going to ban bump stocks, then you’re going to need to ban belt loops, too
2961 2018-02-24 19:08:02 Simple...Gun owners MUST be psychologically stable.  If ANY threats are made to use gun then guns MUST be taken away immediately by Police.  No need for Assault type weapons, large capacity magazines, bump stocks for citizens ONLY for Law Enforcement & Military.
2962 2018-02-24 19:07:53 I agree with banning assault weapons and bump stocks and with investing more into mental healthcare, and even a little with making firearms harder to get. I’m California, it’s extremely difficult to own a gun whereas in Utah, it’s extremely easy. A universal gun policy could help
2963 2018-02-24 19:07:39 Don't raise the age to 21.  It didn't affect the handguns.   
We have citizens serving in the military @ 18.  

They can have the damned bump stocks.  Only an idiot would use something that totally destroys your accuracy.
2964 2018-02-24 19:07:33 I hope their stocks suffer.
2965 2018-02-24 19:06:59 Our military age starts at 18. This is ridiculous.  Not to mention all the hunters that start very young and are well trained and sane. And who cares about Bump Stocks. But make no mistake. Ban Buck Stocks and that is just the start to taking away our 2nd amendment rights!

Majority of gun owners could care less about bump stocks.

Looked at as novelty that could be dangerous really serves no useful purpose.

Dealers don't stock them because there is no demand.

#NRA doesn't support them
2974 2018-02-24 19:04:03 Of course the fake president blames earlier presidents for gun violence. Yet 3 of the worst shootings in our history occurred on YOUR WATCH! Why weren't bump stocks outlawed in October!? You are a joke and a powerless tool of the NRA. Take real action!! #FakePresident
2975 2018-02-24 19:03:56 Like opposing universal background checks. Opposing raising age to buy an assault weapon. Opposing legislation to ban bump stocks.
2976 2018-02-24 19:03:30 In the financial world, "socially responsible investing" is becoming bigger. People don't want to invest in ETFs with gun stocks, for example. I wonder if you could use data from that to cross reference w/ OpenSecrets to flag categories like that. Maybe possible?
2977 2018-02-24 19:03:29 I don't agree with that solution. CBC is just what the democrats have been after. Bump Stocks are not the problem either. A culture that ignores a person with a problem until it explodes into disaster is at fault.
2978 2018-02-24 19:03:07 Dnt worry our guns arent goin anywhere! Maybe ull get bump stocks regulated but even if all gun were banned since wen do criminal follow the law!?!?!
2979 2018-02-24 19:03:00 '' The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks ''

If >21 can't buy, then they shouldn't be able be legal adults until then either
Bump stocks are a footnote.
2981 2018-02-24 19:00:56 She should take two stocks when againts her honestly
2982 2018-02-24 19:00:17 @realDonaldTrump Didn’t people invent bump stocks because of the full auto ban? So if you ban bump stocks I can’t wait to see what American greatness comes up with next! Americans generally frown upon having freedom taken away by the government.
2983 2018-02-24 19:00:16 I don't think they do either. I just want to illustrate that a handgun or rifle can still do a ton of damage. I'm not a gun guy but the solutions need to be realistic. Bump stocks, while unnecessary, won't change much.
2984 2018-02-24 18:59:53 Both are to blame. The NRA is definitely at fault as they don’t budge on anything, it took the pres to finally ban bump stocks. #ironic #ignorance
2985 2018-02-24 18:59:38 Their stocks tanked
2986 2018-02-24 18:59:15 さすがにこの時間に廊下で騒ぐのはダメでしょ
2987 2018-02-24 18:59:07 Bump stocks are not the issue. Ban all assault weapons and extended magazines!
2988 2018-02-24 18:58:53 Thank you for Choosing Life Over Guns! I don't believe Children Should have to Worry About Shootings With Semi automatic weapons, ammunition, bump stocks. America Was Safer When These Weapons Were Not on the Streets! Thank you again.
2989 2018-02-24 18:58:36 @ABCWorldNews WOW how about a simple solution on bump stocks is keep the stocks get rid of trumpski
2990 2018-02-24 18:58:03 LET'S ALL TELL THE PRESIDENT BANNING BUMP STOCKS IS NOT THE ANSWER & STOP TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND LIFE SAVING WE ARE NOT AS STUPID JR.
2991 2018-02-24 18:57:16 Quite. This is no time for gossip. Stocks in the square, perhaps..
2992 2018-02-24 18:56:21 Bump stocks are legal, Stephen.
2993 2018-02-24 18:55:00 Imagine being so damn famous you tweet one thing negative about a business that you damn near make their stocks go defunct. Damn
2994 2018-02-24 18:54:52 Prime reason why I dont fw stocks. Kylie jenners tweet just just dropped sc shares & billions in cash. Smh
2995 2018-02-24 18:54:38 #AssaultWeapons are guns like the AR15 that are designed 4 efficient killing. Obviously a shotgun isnt. .306 deer rifle isnt. An AR15 & similar weapons clearly are. Im not an anti gun lib. Im for reasonable measures like banning guns like the AR15, bump stocks, high capacity mags
2996 2018-02-24 18:54:03 ....this jump in the price that led to the invention of bump stocks, a cost effective, cheap alternative.  The solution: add bump stocks to the 1934 law and repeal the 1986 ban.
2997 2018-02-24 18:53:35 @CNN Bump stocks had nothing to do with the Parkland massacre, so why is it coming up now?  Those in charge saved it as a "get out of jail free" card they could use to make inaction seem like action at this time.  It should have been dealt with immediately.  Sick & cynical ploys
2998 2018-02-24 18:53:31 It’s not. I’m a okay with banning bump stocks and increasing background checks...but you ASSUMED otherwise.
2999 2018-02-24 18:53:22 "With a simple change to their terms of service, Visa, MasterCard, and other financial services companies can stop accepting or processing payments from retailers that sell assault weapons, bump stocks, and other weapons of mass murder." @CourageCampaign
3000 2018-02-24 18:53:20 @Aspiration offers banking & investment services w/absolutely no attachment to, or investment in, firearm stocks, fossil fuel stocks, private prison stocks, etc...

*Asking all #2Asupporters to sell, short & boycott stocks of any of the #NRAboycotterCompanies UNTIL THEIR CEOs ARE REPLACED!

3005 2018-02-24 18:51:19 I'm definetly in favor of background checks that are super extensive and at any point you commit a "violent" crime and are convicted you should be required to turn in any firearms. Idk enough about bump stocks or any other attachments to know the actually facts on them.
3006 2018-02-24 18:51:14 You can call me KSR Kween because nobody stocks bottles of soda and plush Simbas like me
3007 2018-02-24 18:51:10 Why not buy some dirt cheap, it is Cryptopia's exchange currency. Most stocks don't trade with dividends, they trade based on the future direction of the underlying company. Why shouldn't there be value in an undervalued exchange coin of a rapidly growing exchange?
3008 2018-02-24 18:50:53 Yellen and the Fed see US economy gaining momentum, what do you think that means for interest rates? #stocks
#fed #bitcoin #NYSE #StockMarket #crypto
3009 2018-02-24 18:50:26 .@realDonaldTrump Banning 'bump stocks' is a bad idea. It opens the door to endless banning. 1st the stock, then the trigger guard, then the barrel shroud, then the barrel itself, etc., etc. Pretty soon the whole gun is banned. Not good, Chief.
3010 2018-02-24 18:47:55 #NRA can organize #BoycottTheBoycotters ACTIVISM by:
*Getting 1-2 airline/car-rental etc. companies to announce NEW or INCREASED discounts to #NRAmembers
*Asking all #2Asupporters to sell, short & boycott stocks of any of the #NRAboycotterCompanies - UNTIL THEIR CEOs ARE REPLACED
3011 2018-02-24 18:47:27 I know they don’t know as pension systems are big buyers of these stocks. Remember what happened to South African apartheid after the divestment movement began. We need to do whatever we can to stick a fork in the NRA.
3012 2018-02-24 18:46:32 Banning bump stocks is a red herring.  Ban the semi automatic weapons and we don’t have to worry about bump stocks.   #cnntownhall. Reaction to Rubio told the story on semi automatic weapons.
3013 2018-02-24 18:46:09 “I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!”
3014 2018-02-24 18:46:05 Alok sir i have registered on site for MI20 so for that we need to pay 12K after trail period or once 12K is paid then only stocks details will be shared. Also let us know about charity in details. Please share details about MI20
3015 2018-02-24 18:44:32 Your anger and insults speak for themselves the NRA is tainted and prevented common sense gun laws from happening, after SandyHook and Las Vegas shooting they could have conceded some ground for Mental Health and bump stocks, but NO, and that is why we are at this point.
3016 2018-02-24 18:44:31 so if you're going to say, "you can convert an AR-15 into an automatic weapon!" 

i'd say, "that's already highly regulated and/or flatly illegal" (which you may not have known)

whereas if you'd said, "regulate bump stocks!"

i'd say, "yeah, good point; i can agree with that"
3017 2018-02-24 18:44:28 .@mitchellvii The only reason bump stocks exist is because of the pointless, benefitless machine gun ban of 1986.  Any gun registered before the day that law took effect is still legal.  In 1934, congress passed the NFA, which was the first regulations ever....
3018 2018-02-24 18:44:14 @JeffBezos I see your stocks are at record highs.  You screwed me, a Whole Foods stock holder, with the WFM buy.  Can't wait to see your company crash and burn for sticking with the NRA!
3019 2018-02-24 18:44:08 Basically, I think he’s saying we should compare bond yields to the earnings yield from stocks. At an earnings yield of 3%, stocks still offer a slight premium to bonds.
3020 2018-02-24 18:43:56 Pretty sure Trump is trying to can bump stocks, hardin background checks, and add mental health to backgrounds so where is the conflict?
3021 2018-02-24 18:43:02 As fun as shooting is, I still see no reason why someone needs to own an AR let alone have it modified with surpessors, scopes, bump stocks
3022 2018-02-24 18:43:02 No, that wasn't me. I can stand on high heels straighter than on foot wearing stocks. #genetics:)
3023 2018-02-24 18:42:50 ‘As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.’
3024 2018-02-24 18:42:18 And I do feel strongly about not selling military grade weaponry to the public. Or bump stocks,etc. Another gentleman on this thread spoke more eloquently to that topic.
3025 2018-02-24 18:41:40 How come all the ccy correlations have broken down? I thought strong yen was bearish for stocks?
3026 2018-02-24 18:41:22 Bump stocks can be made on a 3 D printer. Perhaps training officers to enter a school building w/an active shooter should be one of their demands, it became std policy after Columbine. How about demanding police take action 32 local complaints and 2 federal ones.
3027 2018-02-24 18:41:06 Oh, but they did have part. They lobby, that has power over politicians. Automatic guns are not a part of our home arsenal nor should they be in any home, with or without kids. Bump stocks need to be banned. Research on gun violence is needed. NRA is against all sensible measure.

3029 2018-02-24 18:40:46 We must BAN:
SEMI AUTOMATICS
BUMP STOCKS
SILENCERS

We must EXPAND:
BACKGROUND CHECKS
WAITING PERIOD TO 30 DAYS
DATA BASE INFO AVAILABLE

We must OUTLAW:
PRIVATE SALES OF GUNS
GUNS SOLD AT TRADESHOWS

We must ensure NEVER AGAIN.
3030 2018-02-24 18:39:46 @stocks_n_blondes hi i’m an ignorant stocktwits bear troll who is broke and pretending i have any clue about what’s going on
3031 2018-02-24 18:39:40 Join Gun Owners Of America, they didn't cuck on bump stocks like the NRA
3032 2018-02-24 18:39:37 Problem SOLVED! What took you so long, boys?
3033 2018-02-24 18:39:28 They didn't commit mass murders before they were criminals!  That is what made them criminals! Without ARs and bump stocks (in  some instances) they probably would not have killed nearly as many people.
3034 2018-02-24 18:39:25 Bump stocks shouldn't be banned nor AR15 style rifles. 
Yes on stronger back ground checks, but the most important is harden schools & training to include drills that confront mock shooters. Vests supplied to guards at schools, assualt shields, we must have Viable solutions!
3035 2018-02-24 18:38:42 It Trump bans bump stocks & raises age to 21, it will be more then Dems have done despite years and years of rhetoric ...
3036 2018-02-24 18:38:07 Sensible gun regulation would include parameters like:

1. Maximum muzzle velocity
2. Maximum rate of fire
3. Maximum magazine capacity

I don'tcare about your 9mm 8 round handgun.  I care about effing tactical rifles with huge clips and bump stocks that make them automatic.
3037 2018-02-24 18:37:47 I agree with trump..age should be 21 for assualt riffles with exception of trained military who are under 21...& 18 for hunting riffles..bump stocks should be illegal. This will be the 1 president 2 do somethin about these shootings. Obama did nothing!
3038 2018-02-24 18:37:21 United CEO to lose a job real soon! Selling my stocks before the bottom falls out for not supporting the NRA!
3039 2018-02-24 18:37:07 @realDonaldTrump tweeted that he’s looking to move the age of busing rifles to 21, along with banning bump stocks and background checks. What’s the NRA position on this as they are against moving the age for assault rifles?
3040 2018-02-24 18:36:37 They sure are assuming Putin’s going to help THEM again...

3047 2018-02-24 18:35:43 What does any of this have to do with age or bump stocks? Lots of 18 year olds are sent to war every day by this country and others. Disappointed in you, for using this tragedy to take my rights to defend myself away.
3048 2018-02-24 18:35:32 If you are a stock watcher a few weeks ago Fox Business reported fire arm manufacturers stocks down. Take a look Monday I am sure they will be up. The best marketing for these manufacturers is the anti gun movement. Good or bad this seems to be the case.
3049 2018-02-24 18:35:15 @DLoesch ok demi moore,u're good at your job,u work for the NRA of course u're not going to say ban anything no matter how crazy.but i think deep down u know military style weapons don't belong w/the public.defense weapons sure,hunting ok,b.stocks no,ak 15 no.not necessary.
3050 2018-02-24 18:34:48 And the Fake Medals, “Sherriff?”
3051 2018-02-24 18:33:56 Unfortunately the republicans in Congress have blocked any gun legislation @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr won’t bring bill to the floor and when they do like bump stocks they vote NO.
3052 2018-02-24 18:33:50 Butt stocks should never have been sold!
3053 2018-02-24 18:33:43 The REAL King of “Fake News!”
3054 2018-02-24 18:33:41 Definitely not taking life advice from a Barbie doll. Nobody is taking her guns away. We are hoping Trump goes further than just banning bump stocks and bans AR15’s or any semi auto rifles as well as extended magazines.
3055 2018-02-24 18:32:58 I'm too much Bullish on Large Cap Pharma Stocks for Double or Triple during Bloodbath in Nifty-Sensex.
3056 2018-02-24 18:32:56 It's a good time for investors to sell some stocks.
3057 2018-02-24 18:32:49 It's the people that are the real problem, not the firearm or accessories they had access to. When you look beyond first-order effects you will see that banning bump fire stocks and high cap mags is not the answer.

3059 2018-02-24 18:31:35 How is banning bump stocks and expanding bg checks a compromise? Regardless of whether concealed carry is needed or not can be a different discussion. But if you want to make the country better shouldn’t discussions be detached from one and another?

3062 2018-02-24 18:30:46 I think trying to take people's guns away will end in bloodshed. It's also not politically realistic. End face to face sales, ban sales to people under 21, improve background checks, limited capacity magazines, banning bump stocks all make sense to me.

3075 2018-02-24 18:28:33 Please explain how a semi-automatic (AR-15) is no more lethal to a group of people than a shot gun. Also explain why bump stocks and large capacity magazines do not increase danger. Im not gun proficient but with your in depth knowledge of guns this should be no problem for you.
3076 2018-02-24 18:27:55 The .0001% of the population that gets excited about bump stocks will be upset with Trump's position to ban their sale. It's an easy giveaway in exchange for what he REALLY wants - better health care checks.

And spare me the "slippery slope" argument. No one NEEDS a bump stock.

3079 2018-02-24 18:26:27 No that's no why.  Companies don't want anything to do with the NRA because they don't support sensible gun laws, won't raise age to 21, won't support banning of bump stocks, in fact the NRA want people to own an infinite number of guns and rifles, semi automatics, whatever..
3080 2018-02-24 18:26:24 " end sale of Bump Stocks!" WTF. This is it ? You are one sick person. Grow some balls and do what right.
3081 2018-02-24 18:26:16 I do not agree with you on raising the age limit to 21 for rifles to many young hunters in this country. It’s not going to help anyway if they’re hell bent on getting a gun then they will get one some way. I do believe the bump stocks need to go and check on mental health issues.
3082 2018-02-24 18:26:10 #NRA can support #BoycottTheBoycotters ACTIVISM by:
*Getting 1-2 airline/car-rental etc. companies to advertise NEW or INCREASED discounts to #NRAmembers
*Asking all #2Asupporters to sell, short & boycott stocks of any of the #NRAboycotterCompanies - UNTIL THEIR CEOs ARE REPLACED
3083 2018-02-24 18:25:48 Like handing out guns? Plenty of worldwide examples where gun control works. These people will still exist, they may still go off, but when they do it won't be with bump stocks / automatic fire, silencers, assault style weapons and large quantity mags.
3084 2018-02-24 18:25:47 Better idea is to join Gun Owners of America. The NRA is selling us down the river on bump stocks.  We have enough laws, time to enforce them
3085 2018-02-24 18:25:21 Just saw a video on what bump stocks do... should be banned immediately

3092 2018-02-24 18:23:16 Bump stocks are not, in and of themselves, important, but they set a precedent that anything that allows the user to fire a firearm quickly should be discontinued. Gun control advocates in the future could use the same logic to ban semi-auto, <7 lb triggers, etc.
3093 2018-02-24 18:22:18 Lol jokes. Seen stocks fuck too many peoples lives up on the real
3094 2018-02-24 18:21:57 Imagine Blumberg's stocks in a Socialist Regime... 
3095 2018-02-24 18:21:45 Give it some time then you will see it move like the stocks of Greek shipping companies 
3096 2018-02-24 18:21:21 “It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons -- among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals -- to measure their investment ‘risk’ by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks,” Buffett wrote.
3097 2018-02-24 18:20:56 In 2006, the Commissioner of FDA resigned & plead guilty to owning stocks in regulated firms & not disclosing those stocks.  So, Zinke should resign & be prosecuted. #ZinkeResign Donnie's Cabinet needs a good cleaning.
3098 2018-02-24 18:20:53 Have made losses consistently, day after day, week after week and month after month. Not a single day in +ve closing

I have tried different styles, global markets, forex, commodities, stocks, futures and options! Nothing worked

Now I trade only on INDEX, focusing onething 
3099 2018-02-24 18:20:52 Assault rifles don't need bump stocks, because they are already fully automatic.  Some people do use bump stocks on their AR-15 rifle to make it fire faster like an assault weapon.  I think bump stocks should be banned, I don't need one for my AR-15... Any of them!
3100 2018-02-24 18:20:31 Treyvon Martin, Oregon mall, San Bernadino? The NRA didn’t protect the shooter or slide fire stocks after Vegas?

3102 2018-02-24 18:19:51 #NRA can support #BoycottTheBoycotters ACTIVISM by:
*Getting 1-2 airline/car-rental etc. companies to announce NEW or INCREASED discounts to #NRAmembers
*Asking all #2Asupporters to sell, short & boycott stocks of any of the #NRAboycotterCompanies - UNTIL THEIR CEOs ARE REPLACED!
3103 2018-02-24 18:19:31 These are just political statements. Nobody joins the NRA for the travel discounts. All these companies are going to accomplish is the backlash from millions of people thus hurting their bottom line. I suspect you will see their stocks begin to plummet Monday
3104 2018-02-24 18:19:22 bump stocks need to be illegal
3105 2018-02-24 18:19:21 No! Increased background checks, banning bump stocks, and raising purchase age to 21 do more harm than good in the long run
3106 2018-02-24 18:19:09 Blame on both sides. The NRA should take the high road. Automatics were invented to kill people.  The NRA needs to admit that and support banning the sale of automatics, bump stocks  and magazines to John Doe and sell only to SWAT, military and other law enforcement entities
3107 2018-02-24 18:18:49 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS at @CPAC "they" will take away our #2Amendment rights yet here "you" are talking about banning bump stocks, raising age limits, implementing disastrous fix-NICS Bill. Honor your word, "which we will never allow to happen" #TurncoatTrump #nomoreguncontrol
3108 2018-02-24 18:18:34 I prefer to buy call for loong projections, for stocks or commodities. For short-time trading (1-3 days) I use futures only
3109 2018-02-24 18:17:47 The 2nd amendment was made when the only guns available were flintlocks and muskets. Not all this semi-auto bullshit. Civilians have no reason to own such high power guns. Bump stocks and high caliber weapons need to go.
3110 2018-02-24 18:17:03 People are so Brainwashed. Just because @KylieJenner tweets who uses snapchat because of the update the stocks dropped 8%. Some People have no souls... #facts #truth #GodblessAmerica
3111 2018-02-24 18:16:59 Why do you think Obama’s ATF allowed Bump Stocks and those Sig Arm braces.
3112 2018-02-24 18:16:52 Everyone in this venue just stopped their friendlies to watch 2 rosas against a villager in dubs. It was 4 stocks to 1. It wasn't close.

Ohio is wild.
3113 2018-02-24 18:16:04 @esquire @latimes Everyone who owns stocks should be asking, “do I have gun manufacturers stocks in my portfolio?” and Why? #NoMoreDEADKIDS
3114 2018-02-24 18:16:03 Because your suggestions would barely make any difference in mass shootings. The Vegas and Orlando shooters were over 21. Bump stocks should be banned, not just regulated, but even without them, an AR 15 is still capable of mass casualties.

3116 2018-02-24 18:15:47 You’re a financial guru.. Would it make an impact if people with 401k and investors to sell their stocks in those manufacturers?
Big impact or no?
3117 2018-02-24 18:15:44 NICS yes, bump stocks no. There's about zero chance that bump stocks get banned through the agencies. They aren't full auto devices, by law.

I very much doubt Rs are gonna go for ban legislation in a midterm year, especially after they got handed a "Dems want bans" commercial.
3118 2018-02-24 18:14:55 In the last few days I've had people come to me or I get emails on petitions to ban guns, assault rifles, and bump stocks. I'm fine with stricter gun laws sure, but being a gun owner banning guns won't solve problems. It creates more if anything.
3119 2018-02-24 18:14:49 That Jenner woman bad mouthed snaphat and their stocks dropped. Start a campaign against Twitter see what happens?
3120 2018-02-24 18:13:13 They're talking about better background checks for all guns. We can't get rid of handguns for law-abiding citizens. We can get rid of the semis, bump stocks but law abiding Americans want and have the right to have some weapons. Most democrats believe that.
3121 2018-02-24 18:12:44 @tc4az Why aren’t banning bump stocks on your agenda? We live in the state with the easiest access to guns you think it’s okay to let people automize them? 

Also, the Vegas shooter stocked up on ammo from a gun show in AZ. Is closing the gun show loophole on your agenda?
3122 2018-02-24 18:12:12 Stocks
3123 2018-02-24 18:11:39 Many stocks stll being touted as multibaggers on twitter/whatsapp.

But I stay away because
"Mein aaj bhi fenke hue paise (multibaggers) nahi uthata"
3124 2018-02-24 18:11:32 Totally agree I enjoy my guns. But this has to end not by taking guns but coming up with better back round checks. And bump stocks are totally unnecessary. In my opinion.
3125 2018-02-24 18:10:40 #BoycottNRA @starkeyhearing Do you need the business so badly of selling shooters hearing protection products to support their hearing for the NRA that allows anyone to buy and own assault weapons/bump stocks/insufficient background checks, etc?
3126 2018-02-24 18:10:35 And even recently advocating for the banning of Bump stocks.

3131 2018-02-24 18:09:42 America finds itself at a crossroads.  The more passionately gun owners cling to their AR-15s, bump stocks, and the like claiming that it is "freedom", the more our society and worse yet - our children are oppressed...we are on the verge of becoming a police state. #NeverAgain
3132 2018-02-24 18:09:37 Plz tell us also name of the stocks which were the component  in 1989 and 2017.

Agar 1989 me jitne stock sensex me the aaj tak wo sare abhi isme hote to return kya hota ??
3133 2018-02-24 18:09:12 I agree.  Sadly our government once again failed and now they are content with mass media blaming every law-abiding gun owner and an NRA that advocates gun safety and even a ban on some guns and Bump stocks!
3134 2018-02-24 18:08:49 Lol. Really? Republicans have a long history of taking money away from centers that helped with mental health issues, causing them to close.  And their call to ban bump stocks only came recently.  Dems tried to do this years ago but were blocked, by Republicans.  Nice try though.
3135 2018-02-24 18:08:14 the NRA is an evil organization with a leader who is a fear monger and ignorant person, LaPeirre. On their website, the NRA actually praises and promotes ownership of the Ar-15...does LaPierre own outright or thru stocks, companies that manufacture guns? This organ owns yu & GOP
3136 2018-02-24 18:08:11 Bump stocks are not the issue. Outlaw high capacity assault weapons. Bump stocks only work with semiautomatic assault style rifles. Get smart and stop wasting your time on this topic. Assault weapons are the issue! Assault rifles are good for one thing only, killing people.
3137 2018-02-24 18:08:03 I believe the answer is multifaceted. Ban weapons of war (rifles like the AR-15, devices that make rifles rapid fire like bump stocks, high capacity magazines) and also drastically improve mental health counseling and services in schools.
3138 2018-02-24 18:07:46 Reading comprehension not your thing?  It was precisely because of "legal" bump stocks and "legal" AR-15s that the Vegas shooter, who was not experienced with guns (in a professional capacity) that he was able to hit so many.
3139 2018-02-24 18:07:42 You don't understand economics big business is out to make money they will drop you like the maggots you are fast. Look for example H & M made one mistake black Twitter was on them stocks went down. Because everybody know who shops there the most. A bad hashtag is killer
3140 2018-02-24 18:07:16 Now multiple local @NRA members are speaking out in favor of common sense gun regulation, background checks, getting rid of bump stocks, etc. #LD10TownHall
3141 2018-02-24 18:07:05 #BoycottNRA There's no reason for civilians to have assault weapons with bump stocks and no background checks.
3142 2018-02-24 18:06:53 Well you might now but someone else might. I'm down for restricting add ons like bump stocks and absurd ammo mags but rifles like AK's and AR's I feel don't need to be as harshly banned as most say just harder to get their hands on
3143 2018-02-24 18:06:46 I wonder how many members the NRA is losing too? You will have to find out, @EdKrassen  NRA needs to stop it's filthy lying and accept reasonable gun laws if it means banning certain kinds of weapons. No one should ever own automatic weapons, machine guns and bump stocks
3144 2018-02-24 18:06:21 Who can buy stocks?

I assume hunters don't use semiautomatic assault weapons with 100-round magazines & bump stocks.
3154 2018-02-24 18:02:25 Your budget cuts funding for the background check system. Your budget cuts funding for school safety. You signed a law last year that made it easier for the mentally ill to buy weapons. Bump stocks made it possible to kill 59 in Vegas. So you’re responding now? FIVE MONTHS LATER?
3155 2018-02-24 18:02:09 There is a message about asset allocation if you read Buffett's letter closely. "A diversified portfolio of  equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates."
3156 2018-02-24 18:01:47 My ideas are: Change NICS so it hits local records, such as Utah's BCI. Create a national database. That would potentially stop lots. Bump stocks to Class 3. Need to figure out how Class 3 database is legal, maybe from 1934? California has a database. How are they doing it?
3157 2018-02-24 18:01:45 Might have to do with years of fear mongering, won't ban assault weapons or bump stocks, they're on the wrong side

3182 2018-02-24 17:53:56 I'm just gonna assume people who want to ban bump stocks know little to nothing of redneck engineering....
3183 2018-02-24 17:53:50  The fact that our NCIS repeatedly fails is appalling.  I'm all for comprehensive background checks, waiting periods, mandatory safety training, raising age-to-buy long guns to 21, even ownership licenses & banning ridiculous work-arounds like bump stocks and trigger cranks.
3184 2018-02-24 17:53:00 But also a reminder: Buffett loves stocks. He doesn't own bonds and sees no reason to. For short term investments he stays in cash. Longer term, stocks aren't that risky. But long term= years.
3185 2018-02-24 17:53:00 I don’t disagree with background checks, which we already have (4473 forms. Which if you lie on it you get 10 years in prison). What I disagree on is raising the age to 21 and banning bump stocks is fucking stupid
3186 2018-02-24 17:52:37 “I would never have one,” @tc4az says of bump stocks. “They’re dumb as hell.” While being vague on how he’d regulate them. #LD10TownHall
3187 2018-02-24 17:52:13 this is the kind of crazy I am not sure how we the let @NRA make happen in the first place!!  What's it going to take to get some logical reform done?  It could not have been this much of a circus to get this stupid law protecting bump stocks in place... #GunReformNow
3188 2018-02-24 17:52:04 That was something I changed on my company pension. It is a basic pension but still proposed non fossil fuel/weapon... stocks as  option, or use islam friendly stocks (explicitly no tobacco or alcohol) - can’t remember the exact terms.
3189 2018-02-24 17:51:38 So, either general public got really, REALLY rekt in last crash and lost all their confidence in stocks OR they are completely illiterate financially, which wouldn't be a surprise (to me) either.

3196 2018-02-24 17:49:58 Can’t  you just directly say “no, I don’t support raising the age  from 18-21 or the banning of bump stocks”?  Why make everyone have to glean your position? Because saying it directly makes you realize how extreme a position it is?
3197 2018-02-24 17:49:51 I see where you are coming and I agree our government needs to start saying "Hey people don't need bump stocks, people don't need 60 round drums for ammo" because we enable crimes likes this it's a matter of being constructive with our actions and not rash
3198 2018-02-24 17:49:35 Constituent asks @tc4az about regulating bump stocks, “If not now, when?” @tc4az says anyone can set up a meeting to start the ball rolling. @MomsDemand members tell him they’re available next week. #LD10TownHall

3210 2018-02-24 17:46:35 Which is what we need for the AR-16, bump stocks and ammunition with more than one shot at a time!
3211 2018-02-24 17:46:32 I think he meant $cybx
3212 2018-02-24 17:46:30 #BoycottNRA @LloydsofLondon: One way you people make your millions is selling life insurance. Why do you support an organization that encourages everyone's ability to buy assault weapons and use bump stocks to kill and maim people? Shame on you!

3214 2018-02-24 17:45:47 I will give all companies Who are part of this band NRA movement one week before I contact my stockbrokers telling them to sell all my shares of their stocks. You are the caretakers of these companys for the share holders not to dictate to the American people your will.
3215 2018-02-24 17:45:43 I picked up that gun and shot myself while having an abortion where they gave free bump stocks due to this conversation.
3216 2018-02-24 17:44:08 Agree - assuming appropriate actions are taken to ensure she is safe to grow up. Remove assault weapons from our country.Make it illegal to own one.Likewise, lg clip ammo & bump stocks. o one under 21 buys a gun.Universal background checks. Get busy!#BanAssaultWeaponsNeverAgain
3217 2018-02-24 17:44:07 Investing in stocks and bitcoin.  
3218 2018-02-24 17:43:33 What source are you getting your 3% to 4% GDP data? To discredit all of Youtube as a conspiracy theory is ignorant. You’re just pitching Main stream Media lies so your stocks benefit. How do you verify data? Just bc you hear growth is accelerating on Tv doesnt mean it is true.
3219 2018-02-24 17:42:46 Investing in stocks frustrating as hell lol
3220 2018-02-24 17:42:14 The Liberal party introduced abortion. The USA   killed 60 million babies. Do you want to take credit for murdering all those babies by abortion? GOD may have already started vengeance. Read chapters 8 & 16 of the Book of Revelation. 2 billion will die. Stocks will crash in I hr.
3221 2018-02-24 17:41:59 I'm sure during the Revolutionary War all soldiers had bump stocks on the muzzle loader rifles! Only makes sense.
3222 2018-02-24 17:41:19 Besides, the whole country seen what a bump stock does from the Vegas incident and bump stocks are legal depending what state you live. Again, thank all the politicians for allowing gun sales to any person with a clean record & heart beat, who cares if they’re mentally ill right?
3223 2018-02-24 17:40:13 Sold out of patches - you know @NJDevils never properly stocks stuff
3224 2018-02-24 17:39:58 Banning bump stocks and assult (and assult light) rifles, requiring licenses to own fire arms, requiring registration of all fire arms, and providing adequate funding for schools and for mental health services will all have a positive impact and save lives.
3225 2018-02-24 17:39:44 and the NRA and gun lovers, like you Ben, who feel every American has the right to own a weapon designed for war, allowing unlimited magazine capacity, not supporting increasing the age limit or elimination of bump stocks, not supporting universal background checks.
3226 2018-02-24 17:38:55 Same issue as MFs with humongous AUMs? And if course missing out on stocks like Goog and Amzn who in the last decade have redefined the game.
3227 2018-02-24 17:38:55 stocks bought in 2000 at the peak are above 2000 levels for a while now

So if you bought at the peak and mixed w bonds you'd have a solid return.

And in reality people contribute gradually versus lump sum.
3228 2018-02-24 17:38:36 We can absolutely prevent mass shootings such as Vagas by banning high capacity magazines, semi automatics, bump stocks and any sort of weapon with high capacity firing weapon. Without these you tell me how he could kill so many from such distance in such short amount of time!
3229 2018-02-24 17:38:25 I don’t disagree. But enhanced background checks, putting “no fly” people on “no gun” lists, closing loopholes, restricting domestic abusers and the mental ill, banning bump stocks, and letting the CDC study gun violence are all pretty reasonable ways to BEGIN fixing the problem.
3230 2018-02-24 17:38:21 At this point, saying you'd ban "Bump stocks" is as politically courageous as being against Gerber® arsenic cyanide baby food..
3231 2018-02-24 17:37:55 True. I just say words in tweets and people follow. Like if I say something about stocks.. all of the sudden all of wall street starts following me. lol
3232 2018-02-24 17:37:38 We need to pressure private companies in which we invest to cut ties with NRA and have retirement funds to divest stocks of gun companies.
3233 2018-02-24 17:36:50 This is so true.  My son when he was 12 picked what stocks I should invest in (randomly, told him to just pick 3). My $2k investment 14 years ago is now worth $900k. Listen to the children, they are smart!!! Death to the NRA!!!!
3234 2018-02-24 17:36:31 "As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates."
3235 2018-02-24 17:36:22 Safety training, background checks, reference interviews, minimum 28 day waiting period, national registry; banned silencers, certain barrel sizes, bump-stocks, certain ammo, etc. Prohibited automatic, all versions of certain military weapons (ak-47), etc. 1/
3236 2018-02-24 17:36:11 And there are accessories easily available that make this semi-auto combat weapon fire fully-automatic; bump stocks, trigger cranks, etc. That's what the Las Vegas guy had, an AR-15 that fired full-automatic(like a machine gun). That's how he was able to mow down so many people.
3237 2018-02-24 17:35:32 Literally just got the best advice on how to keep myself distracted: stocks 
3238 2018-02-24 17:35:25 He lies 2 the people of this country on a daily basis. He is negotiating school safety like he's buying a used car. He claims to want better background checks, min age 4 purchasing weapons & ban on bump stocks. He will consider 1/3 as success & will tweet how strong he is on guns
3239 2018-02-24 17:35:08 @MotleyFoolMoney can you start to post the weekly watchlist stocks somewhere (ideally show notes?) I've been looking for this check tech company for 20 minutes!
3240 2018-02-24 17:33:59 28000 followers just show how appreciated your commentary is on stocks every trading day......thank you sir
3241 2018-02-24 17:32:39 So why aren't B-H class B stocks not performing better?
3242 2018-02-24 17:32:29 Does this speak to the passive etf madness? Money goes into funds that goes into working stocks w/o regards to these companies ever being able to earn the valuations.
3243 2018-02-24 17:30:59 SBUX traded at 64.87 about a year ago, just closed at 56.14 yesterday. Considering most stocks made huge runs the past 52 weeks, I’d say the boycott bled off a decent part of SBUX market cap.
3244 2018-02-24 17:30:54 Il prend surtout une posture : il approuve ce que fait l'Europe et puis c'est tout. S'il avait voulu que le glyphosate soit interdit, il aurait appelé à une interdiction immédiate (et non pas dans 3 ans et encore faut finir d'écouler les stocks). Ne vous laissez pas berner.

3246 2018-02-24 17:30:10 We are keeping it small but I finally got wife to agree to a Robinhood Challenge to start her interest in stocks. Told her to use the simple strategy of buy the companies you like and HODL.
3247 2018-02-24 17:29:34 Gays who brag about their financial cock and how huge it is (credit cards, stocks, houses) make my cock literally go back inside my body, BECOME a vagina, and birth a baby....It's the most revolting unattractive thing a man can do....
3248 2018-02-24 17:29:20 I’m disappointed. You were my favorite, but I will be selling my stocks and never use your services again. Law abiding members of the NRA have done nothing wrong and you shouldn’t cave to fascists bullying their the way to their goal of removing our god given right to bear arms.
3249 2018-02-24 17:29:01 Actually i do consider getting rid of the 2nd Amendment a bit too extreme, i'm just asking for implementing tougher laws, you don't need military style weapons just to defend yourself and neither bump stocks, Universal background checks is not even a thing
3250 2018-02-24 17:29:01 Why is it you seem fixated with bump stocks?

3252 2018-02-24 17:28:46 “I’m not in favor of bump stocks, but we have an agenda to keep and better things to do than turn the floor into a circus,” says @tc4az. #ld10townhall
3253 2018-02-24 17:28:11 The well-regulated militia 2A people are the funniest to me. Yeah, Bob, you and your shooting range buddies are gonna take on literally the most powerful military on the planet with AR-15s and bump stocks.
3254 2018-02-24 17:26:34 not only am I wearing stocks and socks, I have navy on black clashing going on and Christmas socks paired with a Halloween shirt happy Saturday folks
3255 2018-02-24 17:26:22 Diverse? Except NRA members? Who's doing ur PR? U need to fire them bc I'm sure Monday ur stocks will not look good.
3256 2018-02-24 17:26:13 #BoycottNRA @eHealth What is wrong with you that a HEALTH organization would support the NRA, an organization that doesn't care if people are killed or maimed with assault weapons and bump stocks? I encourage everyone who uses your service to stop!
3257 2018-02-24 17:25:58 Again, tRump do you realize you can ban bump stocks but that wont solove the problem. Everyone who owns an AR-15 knows you can hold the rifle sideways aganist your hip and recreate what the bumpstock does!!!!!!!
3258 2018-02-24 17:25:37 condemning us like stocks
Why are they killing us before we can even try, enemy enemy enemy
Why are you hanging your head and accepting it already?

3259 2018-02-24 17:25:24 When it says ATATA took 5 stocks when he actually took 6. o.O
3260 2018-02-24 17:25:20 Nope only the fully automatic. But bump stocks which convert them to automatics are completely legal.
3261 2018-02-24 17:25:13 I didn’t say to ban them either. Please show me where I did. I said increase the age to be able to purchase. Ban bump stocks for sure though.
3262 2018-02-24 17:25:04 That's because your brain is too fried by watching dishonest media on tv and the internet. Democrats want better background checks, until the president says he wants to do them then all the sudden they hate him more somehow. Same thing with bump stocks. Complete idiots.
3263 2018-02-24 17:24:43 Do you own either? I do...so don’t try to lecture me. Bump stocks can vary in rate per user. Did you get your facts from cnn? Never hit 10 a second. Try it yourself. So once again SIT DOWN .....
3264 2018-02-24 17:23:36 All I know, is that after that performance in the last 20 minutes, My Strongbow stocks will absolutely demolished by the end of the night.
Win or lose , on the booze, if we draw, drink some more!!!
3265 2018-02-24 17:23:30 I agree with Trump on bump stocks, age, and more detailed background, and also cross checks to other states, things we missed on this shooter.  We can have 2A and still stop this.
3266 2018-02-24 17:23:26 I thank you! And yeah I suppose both sides could learn something. And I agree we most certainly don't need things like bump stocks or 60 round ammo drums. And yes you are correct knives can't kill as fast.
3267 2018-02-24 17:22:52 Will Kentucky General Assembly this session vote on, much less pass, any of the following gun legislation: safe storage; Red Flag; bump stocks; AR-15s; increased purchase age? If not, it's a disgrace & outrage. Need state legislators on record now.
3268 2018-02-24 17:22:46 Trading Tip: Some of the aggressive moves lower in stocks are scaring investors into selling, when they actually should be buying for the longer run!
3269 2018-02-24 17:22:34 Daming stocks ng pagkain eh noh
3270 2018-02-24 17:22:11 How about parents who pay attention to their kids. How about teaching morals, honor, integrity. How about instilling empathy.  How about encouraging something besides gaming.  Gun control & bump stocks are the wrong conversations.
3271 2018-02-24 17:22:01 Good. Next steps...
[  ] Ban bump stocks
[  ] Universal background checks 
[  ] Universal gun registration

3273 2018-02-24 17:21:15 Waiting on these stocks to go down lol.
3274 2018-02-24 17:21:12 LOL that guy has a fake twitter with 90k+ followers? Time to drop my @Twitter stocks
3275 2018-02-24 17:20:43 Colleges and Universities must divest themselves of gun manufacturer stocks
3276 2018-02-24 17:20:40 Man like has bin waiting for those bread toe for 5 hours. Of course we now know  that whatever caring the stocks had an accident ....
3277 2018-02-24 17:20:32 Glad I don’t have their stocks. Would sell if I did
3278 2018-02-24 17:20:01 Vegas and Florida is all staged.  Cry Gun control and gun sales go up. Just ban bump stocks, don’t arm teachers b.c next thing we will hear is a story about a student shooting up the class with a teachers gun....
3279 2018-02-24 17:20:00 Liberals also own guns. Many conservatives are calling for more gun control. Most Americans support gun control. We’re not trying to ban all guns. We just don’t think that civilians need 5 semi-automatic weapons, a stockpile of ammo, and things like bump stocks.
3280 2018-02-24 17:19:36 @MikEffect clutching out our first doubles match being down 3 stocks lmaoo ness back throw broooookin!
3281 2018-02-24 17:19:35 Please fight to ban weapons such as ARs and multiple rounds of ammunition, bump stocks. Don’t arm teachers with guns! Their job is to educate!
3282 2018-02-24 17:19:19 I take no issue with stronger backround checks or even banning bump stocks raising age limit but all fails when guns bought illegally when stolen its not the weapons its the people
3283 2018-02-24 17:18:49 Now that $dmgi is trading and $cybx is trading monday we will have a better idea what $cryp will be trading at. $dmgi marketcap currently at $140 million
3284 2018-02-24 17:18:35 @williamsforga I saw you this morning on the news no way you would ever get my vote! Are you really serious giving away bump stocks? Cray
3285 2018-02-24 17:18:01 Good for everyone who has his stocks in their portfolio
3286 2018-02-24 17:16:19 Disappointed in this stance. A violation of the 4th amendment. Limiting purchase of items such as bump stocks is just another way the government takes away the people’s freedom and rights.
3287 2018-02-24 17:16:03 Bump stocks were unavailable online after Vegas, but only as long as it took new ones to come from China.
3288 2018-02-24 17:15:52 If anyone loves a mass shooting it’s the NRA who has increased in membership. Also the people with stock in gun companies who see the stocks soar...
3289 2018-02-24 17:15:37 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your fibromyalgia
3290 2018-02-24 17:15:21 So we know law enforcement screws up.  More reason to ban assault rifles. We can’t rely on them. Now will you answe if you support raising the age to 21 and banning bump stocks?
3291 2018-02-24 17:15:03 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr I’m I gun owner and have a concealed carry license. I want the NRA to start being reasonable. Teens, mentally ill don’t need guns at all. Nobody needs bump-stocks, high cap magazines and military style weapons. Have notified my OK reps #BoycottNRA
3292 2018-02-24 17:13:54 As an investor I buy and sell stocks to make money. I don't want to invest in a company that is making decisions to possible lose 5 million customers. That's just bad business. And the majority of people had no idea they were giving discounts in the 1st place. #BOYCOTTUNITED
3293 2018-02-24 17:13:43 I hate Trump as much as the next guy but that was actually a smart thing he said about bump stocks/gun control
3294 2018-02-24 17:13:21 But it was Obama that passed Bump Stocks and the NRA said this was a bad idea... but that’s Trumps fault right?

Look moron, you put people on his house or add security to schools with that info.
When a school gets a bomb threat what do they do? Hmmm
3295 2018-02-24 17:13:09 Uh-oh, I'd better go check my stocks[heads to backyard]BANKER:
3296 2018-02-24 17:12:51 DJT, bump stocks and improved background checks are the LOW BAR we've come to expect from you. YOU, GOP AND YOUR CONGRESS ARE DOING NOTHING TO HELP.
3297 2018-02-24 17:12:40 @NRA don’t take away our AR-15s but simply put a ban on bump stocks. Problem solved.
3298 2018-02-24 17:12:19 You know obama was the one who approved the sale of bump stocks?
And you can make one with a belt loop....
3299 2018-02-24 17:11:38 I understand and respect your arguments that have been presented although I'm think we are at a draw here but are somewhat at an understanding we both want gun control and I'm prepared to give up extended mags and bump stocks but I'd also like to see better checks on our citizens
3300 2018-02-24 17:11:23 It’s a great day to short airline stocks.  @delta will fall hard as well thanks guys!  
3301 2018-02-24 17:11:11 GOD:  Marco, I know you have sinned by accepting $3.3 Million from the NRA. For your penance, you must demand a ban on all Assault Rifles, high capacity magazines & bump stocks. You must also propose legislation for Universal Background checks with mental health screenings.
3302 2018-02-24 17:11:10 who stupidly have been co-oped by the NRA in the name of conservatism and freedom? Second Amendment does not guarantee the right to ultra dangerous weapons and you and your pals need to develop a broader plan to protect us, including getting rid of bump stocks, large magazines..
3303 2018-02-24 17:10:47 Here are our beliefs: 
-We demand a ban on bump stocks.
-We demand that reforms be made to the current background check system.
-We demand that the minimum age at which a person can buy a gun be raised to 21.
-We are against arming teachers.
3304 2018-02-24 17:08:39 Yea i own literally 2 stocks. Snapchat and Twitter. I get the allure of the game just it drives me insane at the same time
3305 2018-02-24 17:08:35 Background checks for ALL weapons yes. Bump stocks just a bandaid we need to strictly regulate semi automatic weapons for all ages. In mood = scared. All positive movement for the next president who is validly in office. Where are the #russian sanctions?
3306 2018-02-24 17:08:17 Once again, you’re not paying attention and go off on a stupid ass tirade. I personally own guns and never said anything about banning them. I just believe we should carefully vet and ensure training for people who are allowed to buy military-style long guns and/or bump stocks.
3307 2018-02-24 17:08:06 Outlaw bump stocks!!!! "Executive Order". Outlaw all AR-15's, and any rifle, meant for war, not protection!!!
3308 2018-02-24 17:08:04 “Silly plastic accessory”. That’s probably not how the Las Vegas concert goers think of bump stocks.
3309 2018-02-24 17:07:47 Un fav = un ou une artiste qui m'a influencé en bien ou en mal.

Dans la limite des stocks disponibles.
3310 2018-02-24 17:07:43 Written where??? Do you support the NRA opposition to raising the age to purchase from 18-21? How about NRA opposition to banning bump stocks?
3311 2018-02-24 17:07:37 If we're concerned with drug dealers purchasing too many boxes of cold medicine to make meth, how are not concerned about ammo stocks & purchases for potential mass murder?
3312 2018-02-24 17:07:27 Alhe' you guys know the expiry dates of pepper spray even; if that is true, Police and MNDF should be careful of their armory and stocks.. surely they have moles inside 
3313 2018-02-24 17:07:25 You make our point for us, we need national gun control. A federal ban on assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines would help. Thank you. #BanAssaultWeapons
3314 2018-02-24 17:06:46 Blah blah blah....  I want semi automatic rifles, bump stocks, and large mags removed from civilian use.  I don't give af which party does it, just as long as it gets done.
3315 2018-02-24 17:06:32 What abt Tom2 ? With 1,8 bil marketcap a F bargain, just bid 4 And many Will offer their stocks because they are So tired of Goddijn #goddijnresign
3316 2018-02-24 17:06:27 It punishes you to be required to complete background check on all gun purchases? It punishes you to ban bump stocks? It punishes you to require a certain minimum age to buy and own a gun? It punishes you to save innocent people who are killed by people with a gun easily obtained

3318 2018-02-24 17:06:03 With strict gun control laws and common sense. Something that is clearly lacking here. We can’t even agree to outlaw bump stocks and than was used to hurt/kill over 500 people in vegas.

3321 2018-02-24 17:04:47 As a U.S. Marine and responsible owner of many semi-automatic weapons, I despise many @NRA "values"

"Well-Regulated Militia" is not a part of their platform. Background checks are a necessity. Education and training is a must! Bump stocks & 100 rnd mags got to go!

#NeverAgain
3322 2018-02-24 17:04:10 It’s funny, how affordable is becoming unaffordable under @realDonaldTrump Administration’s new tax plan and his signed executive orders allowing health insurance companies (which he has stocks in) this increase premiums.
3323 2018-02-24 17:03:53 @symantec @Wyndham @united @Delta I’m I gun owner and have a concealed carry license. I want the NRA to start being reasonable. Teens, mentally ill don’t need guns at all. Nobody needs bump-stocks, high cap magazines and military style weapons. #BoycottNRA

3332 2018-02-24 16:57:14 ..you’ve given me an  ..for a listI love stocks that the mkt believes are one thing ‘cos history ..but that same history has prompted an unnoticed strategy rethink that mitigates those risks the mkt is still pricing in ..HYNS is another case in point,BILN too, AIEA another 
3333 2018-02-24 16:57:03 Ah, I get it.  Since the stock market is doing poorly all of a sudden, it’s time to talk about bump stocks instead.
3334 2018-02-24 16:56:48 It seems like a mutual fund company could construct an S&P 500 index fund minus gun stocks. Or minus guns & tobacco, for example. 

It would take only a few hours of new-grad work to figure which companies to delete from the original list.
3335 2018-02-24 16:56:16 They’re also woke on the issue of bump stocks.
3336 2018-02-24 16:55:59 I can relate. I have shit stocks.  :)
3337 2018-02-24 16:55:34 Exactly why i will never count on the police to protect my family.   Im keepn my guns and bump stocks.
3338 2018-02-24 16:55:13 As far as being against strict gun laws? They aren’t they support the 2nd amendment now if u want to ban guns then yea they are against that but background checks, mental health bump stocks they support all legislator on reforming those
3339 2018-02-24 16:55:12 Add banning bump-stocks, banning extended magazines, and armor-piercing and hollow-point ammo. And tax the hell out of all gun sales and ammo sales, and eliminate all internet sales of guns and ammo.
3340 2018-02-24 16:54:53 No, you clearly think anyone, no matter how crazy he/she is, should be able to legally buy as many semi-automatic long guns and bump stocks as they want. Why stop there, let’s allow anyone to buy nuclear bombs, too!
3341 2018-02-24 16:54:49 Dear @Fidelity @Vanguard_Group @blackrock,
Please sell the gun stocks in my mutual funds and ETFs!

3342 2018-02-24 16:54:02 All of Trump's proposals including armed school staff stop mass shootings. But background checks and bump stocks will prevent some of the 35,000 gun deaths we have every year. Now we need strict licensing, in all states, registration of all guns, restrictions on used sales.
3343 2018-02-24 16:54:00 Our Mother's Day gifts are ready to grab from Monday. While stocks last !  Don't miss out !  
It's on Sunday 11 march btw
3344 2018-02-24 16:53:28 OK  time to stop arguing about this.  The real issue is that people are dying from AR 15s and bump stocks.
3345 2018-02-24 16:53:20 Who was the lad who predicted we’d win 4-2 after it was 2-2?  I need to ask him about some stocks and lottery numbers.
3346 2018-02-24 16:53:11 Now colleges and universities need to divest from gun manufacturing stocks
3347 2018-02-24 16:53:09 And the pension funds, mutual funds, large investors should dump their stocks, short them and buy puts...ti do what is morally right
3348 2018-02-24 16:52:59 Only time i would consider doing it is on the call side (long fut short call) which is just a short put but some rare times on illiquid stocks i have seens calls having a little more liquidity than puts and allows me to sell a synthetic put
3349 2018-02-24 16:52:57 Buy some of his stocks
3350 2018-02-24 16:52:01 The House of representatives in Washington State just passed a Bill banning bump stocks. It's a start!! And yes there is screaming from the GOP about chipping away at the 2nd amendment; but we have action!  #NEVERAGAIN
3351 2018-02-24 16:51:42 it is one of those stocks ..like BILN..for whom the credit crunch was uniquely challenging , exacerbated by debt at the time, they have learnt the lesson & now run a substantial net cash position..with a special dividend return when it gets too embarrassing to hold ..incoming
3352 2018-02-24 16:51:40 They are the same gun!
The only difference is the "Furniture".
(the stocks are different ...)
3353 2018-02-24 16:51:00 Controls yes.  Background checks,  Ban of Bump Stocks and raising legal age for purchasing guns,  all mostly supported by the NRA.  Not a blanket repeal of 2A as touted by Democrats.
3354 2018-02-24 16:50:56 #AMJOY understand that @GOP elected officials also go into office to enrich themselves. Recent example given - elected officials knew USA contracts were buying Russian Tanks via #GOPTaxScam so they invested in defense contractors corporate stocks using insider info! @amjoyshow
3355 2018-02-24 16:50:18 I almost wonder if the NRA has an agreement with Trump, like, "we'll come out and say no to everything, you propose some bullshit like ban bump stocks, we'll yell and scream, and then the media will talk about you 'standing up' to us LOLOLOLOLOL!!"
3356 2018-02-24 16:50:17 @DonaldJTrumpJr Here is a daily reminder to please talk to your father. President Trump needs your influence on firearms. The same logic that applies to bump fire stocks as a rate increasing device can apply to almost any rifle accessory. This can be used to ban semi-autos.
3357 2018-02-24 16:50:08 @JoyAnnReid #AMJoy not only does @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump need to be in office to enrich themselves @realDonaldTrump will tell them what they need to know. Also look at how he swings the stocks of Boeing and other companies by talking them down. There’re probably Day-Trading.
3358 2018-02-24 16:49:50 The NRA also opposes any reasonable legislation supported by the vast majority of Americans, such as raising the age limit to purchase assault rifles to 21 or banning bump stocks. They have become a fringe group & should be treated as such.
3359 2018-02-24 16:49:10 Warren Buffett needs to retire and enjoy the rest of his life with his family instead of worrying about stocks the younger generation handle it
3360 2018-02-24 16:48:48 I'd suggest you sell their stock, take your profits and move on. I won't trade in any company who supports the NRA. I also won't trade oil, tobacco, insurance stocks. Most certainly not weapons manufacturers.
3361 2018-02-24 16:48:44 stuff like this is more impactful in smash 4 cause of less stocks but im sure theres basic stuff you know in melee not do to or you're pretty much instantly killed. it's kind of the same.
3362 2018-02-24 16:47:45 #Dumpgun @blackrock funds. Largest owner of gun stocks. #StopGunViolence
3363 2018-02-24 16:47:40 1/2 disagree. millions of law-abiding gun owners (like myself) do NOT see the NRA as their/my voice. i support responsoble gun ownership WITH enhanced background checks, WITH age requirements, WITH a ban on certain weapons, ammunition and bump-stocks.
3364 2018-02-24 16:47:10 I got 3 stocks as collectors items of Baby Bells now defunct, from after the divestiture  as paper

Wow. Ika pila na niya na rehearse na line? Hahahaha
3366 2018-02-24 16:46:16 Bump stocks should be banned completely and their use outlawed; I’m exposing the roots of uncompromising groups that value weapons of personal destruction over our very lives. Peace!
3367 2018-02-24 16:46:07 This is weak & pathetic! You have no real plan on how to solve this problem! Here is step #1: BAN ALL ASSAULT GUNS step:#2 increase bkg checks step#3:prevent terrorists or mentally ill from ever buying a gun step #4> ban bump stocks step#5: > school security & improve structure!
3368 2018-02-24 16:45:41 Washington st needs to stop bump stocks by buying them back If that is what is needed then no more assault guns
3369 2018-02-24 16:45:22 It’s stoppable, just need to ban the tools that cause it Bump Stocks and Assault weapons, people are not always born with mental deficiencies, they can be triggered with emotional issues, so mental background checks would be useless in those cases.
3370 2018-02-24 16:45:14 Banning bump stocks and raising the age won’t do any good. There’s enough laws on the books.
3371 2018-02-24 16:45:09 Do it!!  #StockSale Get some Liquid ready!  I’m going to buy all transportation stocks and futures watch what happens!  

#BoycottNRA
3372 2018-02-24 16:45:05 Ban bump stocks not semi auto weapons.
3373 2018-02-24 16:44:31 you didn’t know that obama approved and signed for the sale of bump stocks. ignorant for blaming the NRA for this savage murder They don’t make law, don’t In force the law.  feds and law inforcement failed us. You may an actress, but you know nothing about politics or the law
3374 2018-02-24 16:44:19 What @waynelapierrejr (NRA Dick) will NEVER say is How NRA can DO BETTER!! This fight is NOT about 2nd Amendment, its about OUR CHILDREN!! We want SMART regulations regarding "bump stocks, age reqmt, no AR-15, extreme BACKGROUND vetting"!! @washingtonpost @SenJohnMcCain @cnnbrk
3375 2018-02-24 16:44:16 George Soros buddy and Trump attacker Warren Buffet now touting a $29 billion profit from tax changes under our president.  Interesting thing is that CNN types will spout crumb talk like Pelosi without noting that this aids working class pension funds invested in stocks
3376 2018-02-24 16:44:03 Don't see it that way. Almost as when people got in an uproar for Pres. Trump tweeting negatively about Nordstom. You can see with that tweet and this one...some agree, some disagree. Unless he has stocks in United.
3377 2018-02-24 16:43:52 Instagram stocks just went up because of how much got7 been posting
3378 2018-02-24 16:43:50 Because they can do PR for the liberals while appearing to be independent.  Ironically by leaking this prior to the budget it can affect media stocks yet media publishes it with no complaints about a budget leak.

3380 2018-02-24 16:42:05 @POTUS I hope you know you can’t end sale on bump stocks without having a new amendment to appeal the 2nd amendment. Also I have some good ideas I want to present to the secretary of education that I believe would work and it won’t mess with budgets.

3382 2018-02-24 16:41:39 Democrats literally blocked legislation sponsored by republicans and the NRA to eliminate bump stocks after Vegas. This is about politics not safety.
3383 2018-02-24 16:41:38 I have written several times need stocks through official channel but no body is interested I am surprise my sales with your product is now even 5%  after that also company claim no 1, sorry sir need correction

As a Fidelity customer, I want gun stocks out of my funds.  FSSVX, FSCKX, FSTVX, FNCMX.
3389 2018-02-24 16:38:47 I believe the 1986 Law is for machine guns, and now if we remove bump stocks it slows down the semi-autos back to their normal speed.
3390 2018-02-24 16:38:04 I hope their stocks tank on Monday.
3391 2018-02-24 16:37:37 @Vanguard_Group please divest from NRA and gun manufacturers stocks or I'm happy to divest the balance 2/3 of my account I haven't already.
3392 2018-02-24 16:37:31 Here is a Question.....If it was Christians going batschit crazy and shooting people up and our Schools like the filthy unhinged left as been doing would Guns & Bump stocks be the Issue?
3393 2018-02-24 16:37:27 Step back and look at the bigger picture.  Bump stocks should have never been able to be purchased in the first place. Do you even realize,  you can walk into staples and 3D print one? This is so out of control! Every man for himself. #bumpstocks #BanAssaultRifles #NRABoycott
3394 2018-02-24 16:37:03 Please tell Emma that we have been debating these NRA stooges for decades. The people who want gun control are the majority and it's time we're heard. Background checks, ban bump stocks, raise buying age... then ban military-based weapons. #StudentsDemandAction
3395 2018-02-24 16:36:54 I don’t agree that an assault weapon is needed. I think it’s that people feel if you ban one weapon it opens the door to banning more. It feeds the frenzy. Bump stocks also should be illegal.
3396 2018-02-24 16:36:38 The only animals auto- and semi-auto guns kill are the human species. No onei is asking anyone to give up their rights to bear arms, just assault guns. You don't need bump-stocks to kill a deer... raising the age doesn't interfere with any rights, safety is all persons right.
3397 2018-02-24 16:36:34 And if approached by anyone with a get rich quick scheme in either stocks or commodities keep this hoary old saw in mind: THE QUICKEST WAY TO DOUBLE YOUR MONEY IS TO FOLD IT IN HALF AND PUT IT RIGHT BACK IN YOUR POCKET!"
3398 2018-02-24 16:36:34 yes but people that invests in stocks, overall have a better pension, savings..etc (overall..so not always. Risky)
3399 2018-02-24 16:34:53 #neveragain It will be hard to take any guns away. The solutions which will save lives are banning of high cap magazines and bump stocks.
3400 2018-02-24 16:34:41 Is thay why the NRA came out against bump stocks right after Vegas, before they even knew what happened?
3401 2018-02-24 16:34:28 How does bump stocks and back ground checks infringe 2nd Am rights @IngrahamAngle
3402 2018-02-24 16:32:57 1.5 Trillion before EOY 2018.
Govts starting to bring their own cryptos.
Money gonna start flowing from stocks into crypto as crypto is like 10 times volatile, which for some means 10 times faster gains.

End of 2019 probably be 5 Tril.
3403 2018-02-24 16:32:03 The Las Vegas shooter was over 21 and had 24 weapons including AR-10s and AR-15s. Only the AR-15s had bump stocks. Be brave - do more.
3404 2018-02-24 16:31:40 @Delta @united We can all play this game! I will use every other resources before I fly these airlines. Sheep to the left vitriol Sadly, many people have these stocks in their 401's, too bad.
3405 2018-02-24 16:31:25 Does Wells Fargo support the NRA?  Does Wells Fargo finamce with their credit cards and lending the purchase of assault weapons and bump stocks for assault guns?  If so, gun opponents should boycott Wells Fargo!
3406 2018-02-24 16:31:07 As a stock holder I am encouraging everyone holding @united Stock to dump their stocks. #BoycottUnitedAirlines
3407 2018-02-24 16:30:58 Until they are banned, bump stocks allow semi auto rifles to fire like full auto.  Also your making the point that an AR is not good for home defense.  An argument AR owners make all the time.  ARs are designed to take large magazines that can be easily reloaded for maximum death
3408 2018-02-24 16:30:54 Are stocks at a sensible P/E compared to interest rates? This seems to be an important assumption for Mr. Buffet.
3409 2018-02-24 16:30:52 Mr President, a good start but very insignificant and lame! You CAN DO MUCH MORE!  These two would NOT have prevented most of the massacres. Bump Stocks  is only the LV incident. Please BAN automatic rifles and guns with ammunition >10.
3410 2018-02-24 16:30:38 The NRA's refusal to consider common-sense  measures like the banning of bump-stocks, delaying the sale of weapons to mentally-ill people, or banning the sale of weapons to suspects on the no-fly list put them in this  position.  They did this to themselves.
3411 2018-02-24 16:30:27 If enough people demand that gun stocks be removed from their pension funds and ETFs it could happen.
3412 2018-02-24 16:30:00 My dad gave me my first rifle when I was 13. I love sport shooting. I also support a bit more gun control. Keeping psychos from having guns will not affect me. Outlawing bump stocks will not affect me.  Banning AR’s will not affect me. I still have my guns & can do what I love.
3413 2018-02-24 16:29:31 The NRA is why assault weapons are permissible. They are why bump stocks are still not banned. No, the NRA is responsible.
3414 2018-02-24 16:29:00 "It's a terrible mistake for investors w/long-term horizons-among them,pension funds,college endowments and savings-minded individuals-to measure their investment“risk”by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds&stocks. Often,high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk"
3415 2018-02-24 16:28:52 So what about banning bumper stocks or something when Sandy Hook happened?  Probably didn’t hear you whining
3416 2018-02-24 16:28:33 So does anyone have any ideas about cobalt stocks.  Glencore is a big miner, but the DRC could nationalize their mine overnight.
3417 2018-02-24 16:28:31 Why in God's name do you care about Bump stocks?
3418 2018-02-24 16:28:19 I’ve seen so many political induced tweets talking about trump FINALLY banning bump stocks, well here’s the funny thing about that. The Obama administration had the ATF allow the use and sale of them sooo
3419 2018-02-24 16:27:56 I disagree with this completely. It is not volume but stocks, compartments, and fluxes. Most of that is well measured and modeled. Humans play a major role.
3420 2018-02-24 16:27:50 What a surprise.
Case law re privacy must be overturned but the 2nd Amendment is what? 
"Sacrosanct" is the NRA's favorite word.
Pretty sure they used it to defend the legality of bump stocks & machined parts that make semi autos into full autos.
But yeah. Let's give up privacy.
3421 2018-02-24 16:27:40 People with 401k need to call their financial advisers and have their money pulled from all gun manufacturers stocks..
3422 2018-02-24 16:27:10 The president banned bump stocks which will cut down on people fire a large amount of bullets in a short period of time. It’s not about guns it’s about the law enforcement that failed
3423 2018-02-24 16:26:47 "I want to quickly acknowledge that in any upcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far
riskier – than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio
of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky" BRK'17
3424 2018-02-24 16:26:43 THINGS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE FOR THE BEST. IF ONLY WE COULD JUST GET RID OF THE AK 15 AND BUMP STOCKS. IT WOULD BE GREAT.  THIS IS THE BIGGEST THING.  ALSO GET THE SCHOOLS PROTECTED. NUMBER ONE.
3425 2018-02-24 16:26:22 I don’t agree with Trump’s views on teachers and guns but at least he’s looking for some minor gun controls (bump stocks/background checks). Meantime the NRA refuse any concessions they see as the thin end of the wedge.
3426 2018-02-24 16:26:17 Indian history of stocks returns is short. It’s possible that there could be a whole decade of negative returns
3427 2018-02-24 16:25:49 1) The evolution of Penny Stocks (PS) and now Crypto. 20 years ago PS were considered the Wild West of the StockMarket and people ran around saying there were unregulated. That was an utterly false statement.
3428 2018-02-24 16:25:04 Let’s hear it for Trump’s courageous bump stocks stand! Must not have any friends in the bump stock business.
3429 2018-02-24 16:23:54 No one is advocating to ban all guns. We simply want common sense gun reform, such as putting more regulations on bump stocks, which can turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic rifle.
3430 2018-02-24 16:23:51 Bump stocks negate your point.
3431 2018-02-24 16:23:30 Claro, cada cual vota por lo que sus constituyentes quieren, y les convenga politicamente. Peeero, poco a poco, se va moviendo el goalpost. Y tienen mas libertad, de tomar pequeños steps. 

Los bump stocks son lo mas obvio en poder curb, y no deberia ser controversial.
3432 2018-02-24 16:23:07 girldick now more after they do about men in stocks
3433 2018-02-24 16:23:06 Only functional difference is auto vs semi but with bump stocks that distinction is gone.

3438 2018-02-24 16:20:45 Why do you think the NRA doesn't want Congress to ban bump stocks? Do you believe they really think it's essential either for the Second Amendment, or for the bottom line of the companies they represent? This is how politics in the 21st century works now.
3439 2018-02-24 16:19:31 David, your intelligence and passion are very inspiring. You give me hope about the future. I will not vote for anyone who does not support more effective gun control. We need to ban all assault weapons/bump stocks. Proliferation of guns is reason for these killings.

3442 2018-02-24 16:18:41 Seriously asking, what do gun owners want at this point? I think most people, myself included, think than we've "given" gun owners too much and just want to outlaw bump stocks, auto weapons etc.

3446 2018-02-24 16:18:06 Buffett: Advises against borrowed money to own stocks. There is no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines & breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions
3447 2018-02-24 16:17:51 I give trump credit for calling on a ban of bump stocks and looking at raising age to buy rifles. I think NICS can be overhauled and made better.

3453 2018-02-24 16:15:59 Huge failures. Unnecessary failures, and hope competent lawyers help them hold all accountable in court. It also shows the need for background checks on all gun purchases and make illegal devices that turn semi automatics into machine guns.  That means bump stocks, ban them all.
3454 2018-02-24 16:15:59 background checks,
 72 hour waiting period, ban bump stocks, semi-automatics.
3455 2018-02-24 16:15:54 Shout out to:
@ConoSquirtle and @cryptoALBundy 

They teached me the finest aspects of #cryptocurrency 
Just a couple of years ago I was only familiar with stocks & bonds. They showed me similarity and so I entered the $crypto #space 

Trying to help the #community since that day
3456 2018-02-24 16:15:52 Let’s watch the stocks of these companies cutting ties with the #nra drop!
3457 2018-02-24 16:15:35 POTUS wants to ban bump stocks. Are you being critical of @realDonaldTrump?
3458 2018-02-24 16:15:28 Oh he is not going to ban anything other than perhaps bump stocks. Don’t buy it.
3459 2018-02-24 16:15:22 Bump stocks really!? Your smarter than that
3460 2018-02-24 16:15:14 The evil shit could not have killed 17 kids without an semi automatic.  I think they are making progress.  Raise the legal age of purchase.  Get rid of bump stocks.  It’s a start.  You still get to keep your precious AR15.  I hope no one ever uses it on you or a loved one.
3461 2018-02-24 16:15:13 Stocks and bonds have been moving together quite a bit over the past few years.
3462 2018-02-24 16:14:53 That contradicts what I remember seeing / reading in the news. But I would have to research to confirm. You may be right. But I’d that’s the case, why are bump stocks still available? There was bipartisan support for a ban.
3463 2018-02-24 16:13:32 What do you mean bump stocks were not banned they damn well better be
3464 2018-02-24 16:13:10 Really, it’s a double edge sword, BC if the ever banned Guns, They would have to take them by force from most law abiding citizens, thus causing civil unrest, stocks crashing, etc...BC even if you don’t own a gun and are a conservative, u stand up for rights!
3465 2018-02-24 16:12:52 Stocks in gun companies have been dragged lower by a cloud of negativity after last week's mass shooting at a Florida high school, which continues to dominate public debate
3466 2018-02-24 16:12:15 @marcorubio Are you still planning to work toward banning bump stocks? How about a ban on high capacity clips? Very serious questions.
3467 2018-02-24 16:12:14 I thought it was stocks like stock market
3468 2018-02-24 16:11:29 So follow the mores of the founders? Donald Trump would have been in the stocks wearing a scarlet A on his chest a long time ago!

Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk”
3470 2018-02-24 16:10:57 What's really nuts is that this is exactly like running an actual corporation and all of our stocks are actually be traded in real-time
3471 2018-02-24 16:10:54 Can we articulate a clear plan on what we want.  Bump stocks, better background checks, 21 yr age all seem reasonable.
3472 2018-02-24 16:10:13 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3473 2018-02-24 16:10:08 Their “compromise” will last precisely as long as this story lasts in the current news cycle. The same as when they “compromised” on bump stocks ban after Las Vegas, which died before even coming to a vote, coinciding with that story fading from the headlines.
3474 2018-02-24 16:09:35 Still just seeing “gun reform” and still not seeing specifics that people want. Banning bump stocks and making people be 21 (in Florida only) to purchase a gun won’t stop shootings from happening. Bump stocks and rifles aren’t the problem in Chicago 
3475 2018-02-24 16:09:27 @nytimes Can you also provide list of member companies and companies supporting #NRA as well? We should all get rid of their company stocks from our portfolios and avoid any brand who are in the wrong side if the history!
3476 2018-02-24 16:08:38 They still do support some gun control measures.  They supported the ATF examining banning bump stocks but then Dems were purposely too ambiguous in their legislation.  Also, they are a non-profit but of course they do need to pay salaries and advocating civil rights takes $$
3477 2018-02-24 16:08:35 Buffett has one big investing lesson in this year's annual letter: Never borrow money to buy stocks...
3478 2018-02-24 16:08:01 .@NRA doesn't care or isn't listening.  Military assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines don't belong on our streets.  #BoycottNRA @amazon @Apple @FedEx @Google @OmniHotels @united What are you waiting for??
3479 2018-02-24 16:08:01 Time for Blackrock Investments to rid themselves of gun manufacturer stocks!  They own 16% of Sturm Ruger, 12% of Vista, 10.5% of American Outdoor.  They must demand change from the source. #BoycottNRA
3480 2018-02-24 16:07:45 @j_bronczek FedEx needs to terminate its corporate partnership with the NRA. Until that happens, my family will make certain that nothing we send or receive travels by FedEx.
3481 2018-02-24 16:07:40 Thanks for reinstating Obama's gun restrictions you signed an EO to rescind.Thanks for suggesting you will have others in the GOP look at the legality of Bump stocks and not pass legislation banning them. I know you look good pretending this is all your idea but quit lying.
3482 2018-02-24 16:07:32 These students are being exploited by the left to further their anti-gun agenda with hopes of winning mid terms. O had 8 yrs and did nothing but approve bump stocks used in Vegas. Focus should be on criminals. You don’t go after UAW when people die by cars. @dbongino @DLoesch
3483 2018-02-24 16:07:11 @mamadidi32 @browardsheriff @NRA 
Sheriff Israel and Ms. Alvarez...
You are both right. Can't that be some common ground here?  How about @NRA donates 5% of it's profits to mental health help and programs? Their stocks are soaring as they do after every shooting.
3484 2018-02-24 16:06:33 $Spx $djia $qqq "Stocks revved higher on Friday afternoon after the Federal Reserve report to Congress gave little indication that the central bank plans to raise interest rates more aggressively than anticipated this year. Treasury yields on the 10-year bond drop to 2.87%."
3485 2018-02-24 16:06:29 Bump stocks will be regulated by the ATF, which I'm fine with. Some disagree, but I'm open to changing the age for long guns to 21. I support temporary gun restraining orders. We need to strengthen and streamline background checks, and prosecute straw purchasers
3486 2018-02-24 16:05:31 I agree on all except on 1. Time & place imo. Bringing averages lower on poorly performing stocks that are below your entry point on plays in a downtrend is when it’s throwing good money at bad and one should never but can be beneficial if implemented upon reversal confirmation
3487 2018-02-24 16:05:28 @RajViews FedEx needs to terminate their corporate partnership with the NRA. Until that happens, my family will very deliberately make sure that nothing we ship or receive travels by FedEx.
3488 2018-02-24 16:05:26 We all know what the problem is. Let’s not argue semantics. Improve background checks, ban the sale and production of high round magazine cartridges, bump stocks, sale or purchase or production of any semi or fully automatic weapon. End the senseless mass killings.

3491 2018-02-24 16:04:40 or the key is to invest in kotak select focus and kotak emerging equities for the long term and let your fund managers find the right stocks.
3492 2018-02-24 16:04:19 And we won’t be mollified or satisfied by useless token gesture changes like raising the purchase age or banning bump stocks - need real changes like universal comprehensive background checks and banning sale of weapons of war to civilians!
3493 2018-02-24 16:03:59 First off...get assault rifles banned. And enact common sense gun laws. Quit making them so easy for people with mental illness to get. Get the national database working. Stop quick sales at gunshows/on-line. Ban bump stocks/high capacity magazines.
For a start.
3494 2018-02-24 16:03:48 3) bump stocks could be done away with and little impact on law abiding citizens or crime, so that’s fine.

3497 2018-02-24 16:02:51 The NRA introduced background checks, supported banning bump stocks, and have been pushing politicians to do their jobs and prevent mentally ill people to acquire guns.

3499 2018-02-24 16:02:32 Now we need to go after mutual funds that hold gun company stocks. #BoycotNRAMutualFunds. #NeverAgain
3500 2018-02-24 16:02:05 How about common sense discussion about guns? 1) Life sentences for using a gun in a crime regardless of whether or not gun fired. 2) Universal Gun laws for nation, background checks, waiting periods 3) eliminate bump stocks 4) agreement on Magazine capacity? #2aDiscussion
3501 2018-02-24 16:01:58 Arming teachers is a re-active response 2 a shooting already in progress.  Preventative actions: Restricting t/sale of assault weapons, having background checks, waiting periods, banning bump stocks.  That's pro-active & sensible. @amjoyshow @davidhogg111 @Emma4Change #NeverAgain

3503 2018-02-24 16:01:54 stocks. He should be against bump stocks... they make a gun basically an automatic.  People don't need automatic weapons.  People don't need AR-15s.  Like Trump is saying.... the minimum age to purchase a weapon needs raised.  Consistent, strict laws need created for how people
3504 2018-02-24 16:01:44 Los bump stocks no valen ni para caza,ni para tiro,ni para autodefensa.Solo valen para asesinatos en masa.El 100%de los mass shooters en EEUU los usan.Sin ellos,no tendrían "exito".La NRA ve bien la prohibición de estos dispositivos,y Obama se opuso a su prohibición.
3505 2018-02-24 16:01:30 That oughta’ do it!  Yessiree, it’s back-slapping time in Olympia!  And, all you gun owners with bump stocks already —give ‘em back!  Maybe to Goodwill, or some outa’ stater. Yessiree!  Gosh, ain’t it good to feel safe now?
3506 2018-02-24 16:01:14 Makes you wonder if he owns oil and mining stocks too because he’s might interested in converting public lands into a payday. 
3507 2018-02-24 16:01:10 Oh, been there.  I invest in index funds as I know I can't beat the market.  My father?  That is a different story--Tootsie Roll stocks, son, Tootsie Roll stocks.

Oh and you should see my ISA paper--where I invoke the efficiency producing joys of market competition.
3508 2018-02-24 16:00:58 My dad gave me my first rifle when I was 13. I love sport shooting. I also support a bit more gun control. Keeping psychos from having guns will not affect me. Outlawing bump stocks will not affect me.  Banning AR’s will not affect me. I still have my guns & can do what I love.
3509 2018-02-24 16:00:39 I’m not saying no gun laws at all. Deeper background checks? All for it. Ban things like bump stocks n automatic weapons? Cool. But taking guns away completely is not ok. It is my constitutional right to own a gun.
3510 2018-02-24 16:00:38 Bump stocks only emphasize a firing technique, this,same technique can be applied to revolvers, semi auto pistols and semi auto rifles. You don't need anything to do it, however bump stocks make it easier. You can achieve the same results using a shoe lace
3511 2018-02-24 16:00:15 Mr. President.  I have an idea if you don't want to stand up to the NBA to protect all americans, just let every American vote on doing away with assault weapons and bump stocks. You want have to be the bad guy. It will be settled by the American people like it should be.
3512 2018-02-24 16:00:04 Citadel got various diff business...hft,market making,pe,long stocks. 2008 crushed them so macro not them
Ptj flat for years...bridgewater perhaps. Now look at the dozens of macro funds that out of business...soros on record noway he cud repeat his pnl in mkts today
3513 2018-02-24 15:59:46 Also, there is already a bill in place that bans bump stocks. So do you think 18yr olds should be in the military?  I think they say that because if you can be in the military & drive a car you should be responsible to buy a rifle at 18. Handguns are 21.
3514 2018-02-24 15:59:44 Over 5 million NRA members these companies will come back because there stocks will plunge

3516 2018-02-24 15:59:07 Bump stocks are not a right. They are not weapons. They are not arms. They are mods. Rights exist to protect us. If you don't have a good reason to want it; if it's for fun, or entertainment, you are not entitled to it and it is not a right.
3517 2018-02-24 15:58:40 Wah wah wah. NRA is a fear mongering profit chaser. They trick fools into getting all worked up over 2nd amendment. Background checks and bans on bump stocks/large magazine clips is SENSIBLE. Except to feeble men who fantasize about being some vigilante against the government
3518 2018-02-24 15:58:30 INTC, MSFT, Goog, NFLX, AMZN, JPM, BBT, FITB, BAC, CIEN - Sharing few stocks from my list to you.. They all bounce from their 2/5 or 2/9 swing low support. So now you know the floor (downside risk)..
3519 2018-02-24 15:58:28 Same kinda stuff that's been thrown around... background checks, no bump stocks. I'd like to see a firearm tax rate where that revenue goes to enhanced security at public places. I've thought about "gun registration" kind of like car registration. But I dunno about that one.
3520 2018-02-24 15:58:26 Why aren't you mad at Obama?  Bumps stocks are legal because of decision made during his administration by the ATF.  The ATF gave its seal of approval under the Obama administration in 2010.  You are pissed at the wrong guy again.
3521 2018-02-24 15:57:43 @don2 @nastynate1 so now stocks are priced correctly? Lol ok everything is fine again
3522 2018-02-24 15:57:19 Well check it out.  Their statement was very clear about supporting ATF regulatory action.  Which is what 45 has ordered be looked in to.  Its a way of appearing to "ban bump stocks" but really only in a regulatory way vs legislative. A company gets fined instead of indicted
3523 2018-02-24 15:57:10 GOP Devil  Bargain Bills:

3528 2018-02-24 15:55:50 There are 300 million people in the country. The stupidity here is you thinking that Hertz not supporting you and your crew will have more of a financial impact than 99.9 percent of the country turning their backs. have a beautiful day with your AR15s and bump stocks!

3530 2018-02-24 15:55:30 Hm to start with I support banning all semi automatics and acomodations to make weapons automatic (such as bump stocks and others). Then a systematized universal background checks everywhere & waiting period. Backend checks have to include psychological assessment & licensed  1/2
3531 2018-02-24 15:55:25 Some of the stocks in the table are the responsibility of either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.  Each, independently of me, manages more than $12 billion; I usually learn about decisions they have made by looking at monthly portfolio summaries.
3532 2018-02-24 15:54:53 No their food is disgusting. Wym what they are going to do? Theyve already made statements this week that the 21 y/o limit is not acceptable. Theyve already commented on gun stocks this week.  “see what the NRA is going to do”?  Theyve told us.
3533 2018-02-24 15:54:50 "Time progresses and so do guns..." they used muskets when that amendment was written. They didn't know from bump stocks and silencers and semi- automatic weapons. Amendments can be - wait for it - amended! #NotOneMore #RepealThe2nd
3534 2018-02-24 15:54:22 Thank you for saying that sir! I just came from YouTube and saw how bump stocks work and honestly I have no words. There is literally no use for them in hunting as the accuracy goes down a lot. It is just for gun fanatics and that is why it's so easy to get into wrong hands.
3535 2018-02-24 15:54:14 And stocks tumble this year.
3536 2018-02-24 15:53:56 @davidhogg111 We are a retired couple, own 3 shot guns, but we are totally against ownership of bump stocks & assault rifles! You all have started a movement that should have been years ago ! Stay strong!
3537 2018-02-24 15:53:14 Equip volunteer teachers with weapons, they must have a background with guns. Strict background checks and ban criminals from guns. Bump stocks, Trump has banned. Make sure the FBI focuses on threats and doesn't just throw them away. That's how you prevent those shootings.

3539 2018-02-24 15:52:41 Violent priors already exclude ppl from owning fire arms legally.  Agreed bump stocks should be illegal, we need to make it easier for family member and authorities to remove guns from ppl that are a danger to them selves or other as well but that more a mental health issue
3540 2018-02-24 15:52:25 @JoyAnnReid can we talk abt "courage" being attributed to Marco Rubio & Rick Scott?? If my timeline's right, both came out 4 age restrictions on guns AFTER Trump. As 4 Agent Orange, WTF do bump stocks hv to do w/ #Parkland?! Why SO LONG after Vegas? Why now but not then? #AMJoy
3541 2018-02-24 15:52:13 There is a law that forces hunters to limit their pump action shotguns to holding 3 shells instead of the 7 they can actually hold during duck and goose season. If this can be a law, how can we not ban bump stocks?
3542 2018-02-24 15:52:08 #AMJoy Good of @GovHowardDean to point out that the public is far more in support of common sense #GunReformNow & #BanAssaultWeapons (& bump stocks) than Republicans realize. We'll just have to vote them out. #NeverAgain But we'll have to resist NRA multi-million ad budget.
3543 2018-02-24 15:52:05 I should probably buy stocks with companies that make Kevlar vests and helmets; Americans, YOU are going to make me rich like LaPierre.
3544 2018-02-24 15:51:43 And there has been yrs of rational conversation. But the NRA always steps in and squashes any compromise that both parties reach. E.g., bump stocks after Vegas.

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue -
3546 2018-02-24 15:51:15 Better back ground checks,mental health go for it,the bump stocks and the age limit throw it out, I was handling firearms in a very safe and proficient manner at the age of twelve. As well as many others in this country,make the damn authorities do their jobs.
3547 2018-02-24 15:51:09 @Lowes @MasterBrand 3Q 2017 sales $1.35 billion, $550 million dollars to repurchase stocks, new tax break.  No bonuses for wage earners.
3548 2018-02-24 15:50:44 Weird because NRA's Dana Loesch, when asked if she supported a ban on bump stocks, told the Parkland survivors that the NRA supported that ban. Was she lying?
3549 2018-02-24 15:50:08 Are any of your pension funds invested in stocks of gun manufacturers? If they are please reinvest them in something else.  Thank you
3550 2018-02-24 15:50:00 Amazing summary. During crash you earn in couple of months the same amount of money like during 10Y bull market when stocks go up. Panic is so powerful.
3551 2018-02-24 15:49:47 i’ve heard people describe “assault weapons” as having certain types of stocks, or grips, or barrels, or sights. no consistency.
3552 2018-02-24 15:49:20 This is so unrealistic and not doable. Instead of getting rid of assault rifles and bump stocks we’re going to arm teachers w guns?

It’s insane and completely illogical 

Trump who is a moron imo says ex-military will be the teachers.  Give me a break

We look insane
3553 2018-02-24 15:49:05 @POTUS With all due respect Mr President. I hope the criminals take note regarding the bump stocks and the age limit increase to 21. We cannot permit the Democrats to continue chipping away at our constitutional rights.
3554 2018-02-24 15:48:59 After Vegas, the NRA supported the regulation of bump stocks. Rather than pass that regulation, legislation was introduced that would ban far, far more and they opposed it.
3555 2018-02-24 15:48:54 @amjoyshow
“Sarah Rumpf”! What a proper name for a walking Republican talking point. #GunControl Sarah, is not gun eradication. No one wants to take peoples guns. We want assault weapons, extended clips and bump stocks off the market. Rumpf-Trump what a pair!
3556 2018-02-24 15:48:02 And the @NRA and @realDonaldTrump want to ban bump stocks (what is used to turn a semi-auto into a full auto).

3558 2018-02-24 15:46:44 @delta another progressive company that will see their stocks fall on Monday.
3559 2018-02-24 15:46:33 Next to go down r the gun manufacturers. Mark my words.  Anyone that needs a gun, bought 1 in a past scare. This generation certainly isn't buying any guns. I called my broker last week, there r plenty of other stocks that r safer than gun manufacturers, and it's just right
3560 2018-02-24 15:46:25 Trump wants to ban bump stocks.
3561 2018-02-24 15:46:19 Oh, of course, we're gonna defend ourselves from that mean ol' gummint with our bump stocks.
Hahahaha!
Wait, I thought you gun nuts were pro-cop, pro law and order?
You don't like cops? You don't like law and order?
3562 2018-02-24 15:46:19 The paranoia & fear of “tyranny” on the right when it comes to guns is pathological. The worst that can happen after the latest bloodbath is bump stocks getting banned (which they won’t...your newfound favorite org will quietly kill it in a couple months like they did post Vegas)
3563 2018-02-24 15:46:13 True but due to NRA clout common sense laws are blocked. Background checks , bump stocks and people with mental issues and convicted wife beaters be on no gun list.
3564 2018-02-24 15:46:03 How many school shootings would not have happened if bump stocks were illegal?
3565 2018-02-24 15:45:54 Next to go down r the gun manufacturers. Mark my words.  Anyone that needs a gun, bought 1 in a past scare. This generation certainly isn't buying any guns. I called my broker last week, there r plenty of other stocks that r safer than gun manufacturers, and it's just right
3566 2018-02-24 15:45:35 Now we need to go after mutual funds that hold gun company stocks. #BoycotNRAMutualFunds. #NeverAgain
3567 2018-02-24 15:44:53 Trump was always going to ban bump stocks - he is libertarian IMHO.

3571 2018-02-24 15:43:39 Average age of mass shooters in USA = 34
Most used type of weapon = automatic rifles or pistols - BAN THEM
Kudos to you for ending sale of bump stocks (but make them illegal because everyone now is out there buying bump stocks)
GET SERIOUS, donnie.
3572 2018-02-24 15:43:11 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your autism
3573 2018-02-24 15:42:21 I remember back in the days saying Cannabis stocks will never go over .20.. it’s crazy to think we are buying JR’s under 20cents. Lithium is a necessity, weed wasn’t. LI future is bright!

3576 2018-02-24 15:41:57 Also, it's not a right. Bump stocks arent in the Constitution. Arms are. And all rights are subject to limitation. One of the limitations on arms can be no bump stocks. That does not infringe on a right.
3577 2018-02-24 15:41:44 It’s a strategy to buy stocks at a good price if it gets down there.  Otherwise he’ll collect some income while  waiting.  He can do that now.

3584 2018-02-24 15:40:50 Trump is working on banning bump stocks, which were used in the las Vegas shooting. 
How exactly do you explain the US having very low intentful homicide stats if we have more guns than people? By your logic we should be the most violent country in the world, yet we're not.(2/2)
3585 2018-02-24 15:40:36 What a terrible person! its all about money to these ppl! She’s even fighting to keep bump-stocks legal! There is NO legitimate use for bump-stocks! All they do is turn a weapon of war that no civilian should have, into a FULLY AUTOMATIC weapon of war that no civilian should have
3586 2018-02-24 15:40:35 @NRA are you wanting to ban bump stocks?  If so, why? What is the percentage of gun owners with one?  Concerned this is  non issue item that opens Pandora’s box to gun control. Considering dropping membership if this Is true.
3587 2018-02-24 15:40:27 This is about AR's have you forgotten , ??Bump stocks Las Vegas and who cares about the age when in Newtown he got gun from his mother.. You're doing nothing..
3588 2018-02-24 15:39:53 I don’t think she does, but I’d love for her to confirm back when her advisor removed her Delta stocks from her 401K.
3589 2018-02-24 15:39:45 Mr. President agree on bump stocks, but don't let them take away our rights to gun..at age 18 kids enter the military, they should be able to purchase guns if they are in the military...BTW, we VOTE NO ON OBAMA LIBRARY...WE HAVE THE RIGHT...
3590 2018-02-24 15:39:43 #bn recovery from below 24850 could  extend beyond 25350-25500 thanks to external tailwind support but 25850-26200 is strong risk-unwind urge zone similar to value-buy urge at 24500-24850; good to have back & forth big picture focus here till Bank stocks remain hot to hold asset!
3591 2018-02-24 15:39:06 My advice is to outlaw AR-15s, bump stocks and any other automatic weapons. Then, we have locked exterior doors and no one can get in, unless they have a valid reason for being there. Metal detectors are at all the main doors, and security guards escort visitors.
3592 2018-02-24 15:39:00 All bull. Reduce the number of guns: insist on strict background checks: ban semi and fully automatic weapons: ban bump stocks, disallow anyone with violent priors: set up gun registration mandatory in all  states: make licensing mandatory: makes prospective gun owners take tests
3593 2018-02-24 15:38:38 Colorado - semi automatics, assault weapons and bump stocks should be illegal to sell or purchase in Colorado -period.  Not just to under 21
3594 2018-02-24 15:38:34 England want to drop ye like a hot potato. You're costing them a fortune. If it wasn't for the Tories you'd be up shit creek 

And even the blind can see how hated they are too.  No win situation. Laughing stocks the lot of ye
3595 2018-02-24 15:38:29 #Trump #Congress #Rubio #Republicans #Americans #RickScott we need to ban the purchase and sale of "bump stocks" that allow for faster firing of weapons... It’s common sense!!! #SaveOurChildren
3596 2018-02-24 15:38:28 You know Jay WA law semi auto is legal, one trigger pull 1 bullet. What a bump stock does is take the internal workings of a gun to another part, the stock. Illegal to own a machine gun in WA, bump stocks just relocate the workings to another part of the gun and should be illegal
3597 2018-02-24 15:38:18 Look at the damage AR-15s with bump stocks did in Las Vegas.
3598 2018-02-24 15:38:12 Also regarding bump stocks.  They do not support criminalizing the sale of bumpstocks.  Their statement is they support ATF regulatory prohibitions on bump stocks which is much weaker than legislative action.   Why?
3599 2018-02-24 15:37:24 U can eliminate a threat without assault rifles. It takes almost an act of GOD to eliminate the 2nd amendment. Not 1 person is trying to do away with the 2nd amendment. Banning bump stocks, banning assault rifles, universal backgrounds & raising the age limit will save lives.
3600 2018-02-24 15:37:23 You think we the people won't do anything about you being against our country and its citizens. The conservatives are the ones with most of the money. Now you will experience what many others have. Watch your stocks drop, your fairs drop, you money float away. You blew it! Ba Bye
3601 2018-02-24 15:36:47 You ignorant idiot - Trump has gone far beyond any NRA talking points: Bump stocks, background checks, mental health, raising age, etceteras. You are NOT being rational or even trying to protect kids - Try a comprehensive approach including why 4 deputies stood by "waiting".
3602 2018-02-24 15:36:36 Watch for financials/Tech stocks pullback on monday or tuesday to their 4hr or 1hr timeframe support assuming their very last swing high holds. May be that will be the option buying opportunity or stock adding opportunity..
3603 2018-02-24 15:36:34 Please make sure you are talking about Gat Cranks when talking about modifications. A Gat Crank is a $40 trigger crank that turns a semi-automatic into an automatic. They need to be included with bump stocks. #MarchForOurLives
3604 2018-02-24 15:36:21 I don't care if they get the names wrong but the differences between semi/full auto and single shot weapons needs to be known as it's part of the discussion. For example they're discussing a ban on bump fire stocks, it can be important to note these only work on semi auto guns.
3605 2018-02-24 15:36:18 Bump stocks are history. Deal with it. #NRABloodMoney

3608 2018-02-24 15:35:00 I'd sell your stock in the gun manufacturers. There are the next ones to go down. I called my broker last week there are plenty of other stocks to own that are a lot less risky plus I don't see millennials buying guns anytime soon
3609 2018-02-24 15:34:55 Bump stocks can be banned no issue there.... they dont want to hear our voices. It doesnt help their mission.

3611 2018-02-24 15:34:39 This is not being against bump stocks: " National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law. "
3612 2018-02-24 15:34:34 In a press release, the NRA said they “now have a friend at the White House in President Trump and at the Department of Interior in Secretary Ryan Zinke.” Zinke violated federal law by not disclosing stocks he owns in gun industry due to conflict of interest

to keep guns away from the bad guys?  In the meantime, I’ll keep my AR15’s, bump stocks to protect my family & community
3616 2018-02-24 15:33:14 Certainly. Hindsight is 20/20. Would 'see something, say something' help prevent a shooting like the one in Las Vegas? No. But banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines might have. Flagging him when he started stockpiling guns might have.
3617 2018-02-24 15:33:07 Have been working on gun harm reduction for 40+ years. I am willing to accept gradual steps in the right direction. In favor of stronger & universal background checks, ban on bump stocks, strict regulation of assault type weapons, waiting periods, "red flag" regulation & research
3618 2018-02-24 15:33:00 All rifles that can hold clips can be used like these AKs  and people need to understand what an auto and semi auto really are; it's the clips, bump stocks and especially the bullets THAT ARE NOT 2A protected - how about max 8 shot clips that are not quickly changed some how?

3623 2018-02-24 15:32:18 Bump stocks should be regulated not banned.
3624 2018-02-24 15:32:13 What do you mean it's our history? We need bump stocks to protect us from tyranny?
3625 2018-02-24 15:31:51 We are going to collapse in the next few years. Events like a school shooting are now 'fake news', refuse to give up bump stocks (you can keep pistols, shotguns, etc), and dont realize that a gun was made to kill, nothing else. Computers, cars, arent.
3626 2018-02-24 15:31:46 I think bump stocks should be, I feel assault style weapons should not be banned, I don't think everyone should be able to buy it without some strings attached and I am for all those things you say. You members can change this, let them hear YOUR voice.
3627 2018-02-24 15:31:34 Heck, he legalized bump stocks. Thanks Obama #Vegas
3628 2018-02-24 15:31:34 Parties going beyond intended purposes of legislation is one reason why we have courts. Just like pro-gun people found way around to create/sell bump stocks those on other side can take a piirly drafted legislation and use it to extend it's purpose.

3635 2018-02-24 15:28:42 But people who DO understand guns know what they’re talking about and play dumb because they don’t want their toys taken away, instead of actually trying to explain things. When most say assault rifle, they mean all semi-auto and full-auto gun or mod (like bump stocks)
3636 2018-02-24 15:27:44 But I do agree that using a bump stock does make a semi auto fire at a full auto rate. It would not hurt my feelings if bump stocks were regulated the same as full auto rifles. That’s my personal opinion. I can’t speak for everyone. Maybe a nationwide vote on this would help.

3639 2018-02-24 15:26:37 Please do not end the sale of bump stocks President Trump.
3640 2018-02-24 15:26:30 You do know they’ve been supporting the ban of bump stocks, increased state reporting and sharing of information on prohibited users, and much more. Less shootings and less regulations vs events that lead to a ban. Which do they support?
3641 2018-02-24 15:26:23 Wayne LaPierre&Dana Loesch seem to believe that the media & Dems are responsible for lack of proper background checks.Yet THEY'RE the ones preventing it from happening!AND want to keep assault weapons & bump stocks on the market! Hypocrites! Money over lives!
3642 2018-02-24 15:26:01 NRA keep your guns, but we must have a ban on bump stocks, move the age to 21 to purchase a firearm , cut out the gun show loop hole,  extensive federal background checks. Armed SRO's inside every school.
3643 2018-02-24 15:25:55 So was your ultimate goal in removing the mental health check just enable it again to make it seem like your idea? Did the stock in bump stocks go down so you want out before you lose?
3644 2018-02-24 15:25:47 Banning bump stocks is stupid, if anything regulate them like suppressors or something, banning anything gun related is a slippery slope, next will be magazines, ammo limits etc #handsoff2A
3645 2018-02-24 15:25:43 Nobody is taking your guns...just your AR-15s, your magazines, your bump stocks, every other one of your modern sporting rifles, your right to conceal carry, your suppressors, etc.  But you can keep your government approved blunderbuss.
3646 2018-02-24 15:24:50 It's a start but more companies need to hit them where it hurts (the bottom line). Mutual funds, pensions, hedge funds etc need to dump their gun stocks, short them & buy puts on them.
3647 2018-02-24 15:24:20 "There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and your positions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary." - Buffett
3648 2018-02-24 15:23:58 Bump stocks are not the problem,   its all the laws making  it easier  to get weapon, s. Stop making all these crazy laws and use the laws we have.   And let people  control  there home as the founding fathers wanted.
3649 2018-02-24 15:23:54 Bump stocks. Extended magazines. Hollow point bullets. Bullet proof vests.
3650 2018-02-24 15:23:48 Remington just filed for bankruptcy- no handgun line and few semi-auto army man guns. Too many wooden stocks for this market.
3651 2018-02-24 15:22:30 This means very little (and maybe hypocritical) because everyone who has a TOTAL STOCK MARKET INDEX fund or other indexes in their IRA or 401K owns gun company stocks.
3652 2018-02-24 15:22:23 With all due respect, sir, do you know what bump stocks are?
3653 2018-02-24 15:21:54 "Because I can" is not a sufficient reason. If that's the only logic you can lend to your argument, you need to think seriously about what really motivates you.

#2A rights will NOT be infringed if bump stocks are banned.
3654 2018-02-24 15:21:41 Apparently, it's okay for Robert Mercer's firm to trade stocks & advise clients, while his operative, Conway, advises Trump, & previously Mercer's other operative, Bannon, sat on Trump's other side advising him. I can only imagine what the rest of his super rich Cabinet is doing?
3655 2018-02-24 15:21:07 If Bill Miller is correct this could be very bullish he said:
"I believe that if rates rise in 2018, taking the 10-year treasury above 3 percent, that will propel stocks significantly higher, as money exits bond funds for only the second year in the last 10"
3656 2018-02-24 15:21:00 NRA has strong support of the gun industry - da! Assault weapons, semi automatic and bump stocks on the open market =murder.  NRA is guilty!
3657 2018-02-24 15:20:36 You have to cock an automatic rifle after reloading. Also, unlike video games where you can hold down the trigger and not suffer much kick, real guns have a ton of kick, and automatic rifles just plain suck. The thing about bump stocks is the ar-15 has next to no kick, so you
3658 2018-02-24 15:20:16 To seize this tragic moment to bash President Trump won't serve your political motive. Actually President Trump is the first President trying to do something about gun violence: tough background check, raise gun ownership age, ban bump stocks & trained teachers.

3660 2018-02-24 15:19:49 Why just now regulating bump stocks. They should have been forbidden imediately after the Vegas massacre.

All you do is too little too late.
3661 2018-02-24 15:19:48 PLEASE write, call, and tweet your representatives to urge them to vote NO against H.R.3999 introduced to Congress. The vague wording of the bill would not only outlaw bump stocks, but leave plenty of opportunity to outlaw whatever aftermarket parts that liberals target next.
3662 2018-02-24 15:19:38 Nope. I'm perfectly fine placing the blame at the feet of the NRA. You don't want universal background checks, you support weapons of war in civilian's hands, bump stocks, concealed carry over state lines, gun show loop holes, & more. You don't represent me, a firearms owner.
3663 2018-02-24 15:19:17 If you agree to end Bump Stocks, why wouldn’t you agree to Ban All War Weapons!?!?!? What is the purpose of a War Weapon...? WAR! AR-15s are for MASS KILLING, NOT PROTECTION!!
3664 2018-02-24 15:19:16 Who says I'd invest in the UK or stocks/shares? I do take your point raised in this and other post completely though.
3665 2018-02-24 15:17:57 All this means nothing,bump stocks are just one of many devices to change the rate of fire and the NRA knows this,All yur doing is playin to what the ordinary public doesn't know,If you cared,You would do something about all devices,Yur a fake puppet of the NRA,IMPEACH COWARDICE!

3668 2018-02-24 15:16:35 As I run through my charts this morning I am seeing quite a few stocks setting up at low risk buy points.  What I am not seeing is charts which jump out at me.    The best charts are the ones in which you don't have to think about whether its a quality setup.   You'll just see it

3671 2018-02-24 15:14:50 I'm apparently on the left because I do not support Trump, as u do @SC_Conservetive . But the left isn't trying 2 take away guns. Or 2A like Potus claimed yesterday. Just more control, as far as mental issues,  bump stocks, etc, which Potus seems 2 agree with. @ least this week.
3672 2018-02-24 15:14:32 LT COL. Ralph Peters. As a LT COL, you should know an AF - 15 is no different than a semi automatic hunting rifle with a magazine. Also AR does not stand for Assault Rifle and you spoke about "Bump Stocks" you should also know this rapid fire can be created by using Rubber bands
3673 2018-02-24 15:14:27 LOL.  Before stocks, cake was my speciality.
3674 2018-02-24 15:14:02 Just remember that bump stocks are covered under the ADA. So that might get a strong fight. Personally I think they are useless. But that's no reason to outlaw them. Raise voting age to 21 too. To immature to not murder classmates, then to young to help determine the future.
3675 2018-02-24 15:13:47 Part 2. In good & solid trending markets take a "portolio approach." Take total account, divide by 5 or 6, and that is $$$ amount to invest in each GOOD breakout. Also pyramid properly. Buy in increments. 50%, 30%, 20%.  I would read How to Make Money In Stocks. O'Neil.

3680 2018-02-24 15:12:21 A good portion of sane members will be forced to evaluate their memberships, especially as it gets closer to a fringe org. There’s already a schism forming between the ban bump-stocks crowd and the absolutists.
3681 2018-02-24 15:12:11 There is no one answer but arming teachers is  wrong in my opinion. A good start, again my opinion, is banning assault rifles i.e. ak15, and bump stocks, armor piercing bullets. These are things the average citizen doesn’t need. The NRA and gop are stoking fears to sow discord.
3682 2018-02-24 15:12:03 Bump stocks are not a right.  They are a tool that modifies how quickly a weapon fires.  We’re allowed 5 shots in a deer rifle by law here in MI but you’re crying that your rights to turn a gun into a rapid fire killing machine are being violated?  Get out !
3683 2018-02-24 15:11:42 That is correct how it happened, you started looting our pockets rs35/ per letre,  amounting 15 lac crores in your tenure, you again looted by way'of increase 18% from 15% in service taxes included 75 additional services.reduced interest rates forced common man invest in stocks
3684 2018-02-24 15:11:39 As I stated earlier. No special interest group should be allowed to buy politicians.  And trump is not the first to want extensive background checks. The NRA has fought against that for years. They fought against doing anything about bump stocks.
3685 2018-02-24 15:11:34 I agree with your post, but raising the age to 21 won’t help enough. The average age of mass shooters is 35. The oldest was paddock in Vegas at 64.  We need to reinstate the Gun Check Law trump rescinded and ban AR-15s, bump stocks, armor piercing ammo and high capacity mags
3686 2018-02-24 15:10:56 Yes main purpose of the nra is for their benefactors to sell more guns.  Why do you think they are against even the most basic common sense regulations of guns?  Like banning the bump stocks?  Or enhanced background checks?
3687 2018-02-24 15:10:54 I’m a diehard @BarackObama democrat. I believe in the 2nd amendment. I believe in the right to own ‘A’ gun to protect ourselves. I believe in extensive background checks and waiting periods before getting a gun. I want a ban on assult riffles and bump stocks. 21 to buy a gun.
3688 2018-02-24 15:10:43 Colonizers
3689 2018-02-24 15:08:27 Time for the gun stocks to get bumped.
3690 2018-02-24 15:08:09 Lets not forget that his administration sign the authorization of bomp stocks! Plus all the countless school shootings during his tenure and NOTHING changed! HE DID NOTHING BUT TALK PRETTY!
3691 2018-02-24 15:07:54 You’re not allowed you’re too pissed
3692 2018-02-24 15:07:35 Just read that Zinke put LaPierre's wife on a committee for natural resources and has undisclosed stocks for fun manufacturers. 
Time to push aside arguing with conservatives and focus on getting criminals into jail.
3693 2018-02-24 15:07:29 "There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and your positions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary." - Buffett
3694 2018-02-24 15:07:03 bump stocks & then I turned his commie ass off. Talking about a disguise-very dangerous too.hitlery tells him what to do. he probably
3695 2018-02-24 15:06:55 Trump signed the bill banning Bump stocks yesterday, breaking with them as well. The far right gives all republicans a bad name.
3696 2018-02-24 15:06:39 Just read that Zinke put LaPierre's wife on a committee for natural resources and has undisclosed stocks for fun manufacturers.

3697 2018-02-24 15:06:30 I have maintained this for years. My dad bought and sold firearms growing up. He would get in an order of SKS’s, take the wood stocks off, and put on black fiberglass stocks instead. Would sell them for a higher price, twice as fast.
3698 2018-02-24 15:06:02 No on the bump stocks. Waves wand into law not in America 
3699 2018-02-24 15:05:59 I've sold entire positions on stocks that are trading weak and bought back lower. Lots of caveats to this strategy but if a position trade is retreating I reassess my due dilligence, good possibility I was wrong and I ain't losin my fuckin money due to my ego. Rule 7!
3700 2018-02-24 15:05:38 Now examine the volatility of the portfolio (using annual returns, I guess). And then scale the returns of the FOF portfolio to the same vol as the S&P (or AGG) over the period to compare. Also compare to ex-US stocks. US stocks are the anomaly. And Seides’ error was no leverage.
3701 2018-02-24 15:05:30 Political Hacks,  Obama, under him, Bump Stocks legal. Trust none of these people. There is no reason for a citizen to own a fully auto wepon. Bump stock does that. No reason to give guns to crazy people. Florida did that. Standard Laws is all we need. ATF just do it!
3702 2018-02-24 15:05:11 They support assault rifles and boom stocks. The spends millions to buy politicians to keep these weapons  in our streets and in the hands of terrorists that are killing Americans.
3703 2018-02-24 15:05:01 There's 1675 stocks in the index, doubt one would move it that much
3704 2018-02-24 15:04:48 Gun stocks go up after shootings. Our country has failed the youth. Your time is now to create the "change you want to see"!!!#NeverAgainMSD

3710 2018-02-24 15:01:49 Why won’t the NRA PUT KIDS FIRST!! It is also adults that cannot be safe at a concert, nightclub, or church!!  Mass killings must stop and assault weapons and bump stocks banned!
3711 2018-02-24 15:01:42 yes, but I am sure later all shitcoins will die and the definition will be more clear. There will be only@really good projects around. It is like regular companies, someone does well, someone does shit. The difference that they all have "stocks" (coins).
3712 2018-02-24 15:00:53 Pushing to forbid bump stocks will not solve the problem,
we all know what happened in paris in 2015.
In order to keep our founding fathers legacy, it is prime that we allow our militias to possess state of art military equipment. The solution is to forbid crazy dudes to get guns

3714 2018-02-24 14:59:41 Wow. Stocks agad tingin mo sakin?
3715 2018-02-24 14:59:26 How exactly was hope and change implemented by Obama regarding guns? The legalization of bump stocks? The failure of any new legislation other than the mental health measure they NEVER enacted? A tear is not enough anymore...
3716 2018-02-24 14:59:10 Nobody has ever been able to predict the markets bro. A deep dive would only make these stocks more attractive.  BTW in all bear market there would be sectoral outperformance and to be honest we ain't in a bear market now!

3721 2018-02-24 14:57:52 I missed the part where she said anything about guns being illegal. Bump stocks, period.
3722 2018-02-24 14:57:38 ALL VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD UNLESS THEY ARE HEAVILY CHRISTIAN! Dude I wish this debate would die already, thee people have been saying this shit for decades. We've had studies but they still insist. We are one of the laughing stocks of Earth.
3723 2018-02-24 14:57:35 Remember, Hacks, everyone's a Hack. Obama, under him, Bump Stocks legal. Trust none of these people. There is no reason for a citizen to own a fully auto wepon.

3725 2018-02-24 14:56:13 Bringing up the point on leverage is also a critical lesson for investors to learn now, rather than after the next major drop in stocks (and I'm not talking about a 2 week rapid swoon like this month).

Thanks for the great conversation.
3726 2018-02-24 14:56:05 Boycotting isn’t enough. We need to hit them where it hurts, SELL YOUR STOCKS! That will let them know our priorities- our kids and their safety. #BoycottNRA
3727 2018-02-24 14:55:56 The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre admitted the NRA wrote the foundation bill of the NICS System during C-PAC yesterday and boasted about it. They also supported the 1990 Gun Free Zone Act & ban bump stocks. How do you say you’re protecting the 2nd Amendment? Support the @GunOwners

3730 2018-02-24 14:53:45 It does fit my narrative.

He alluded that at some point stocks will do worse than bonds. It's an interesting point to bring up at this point in time, when bonds are falling (and yields are rising). The fact it happened so quickly at least personally gives me pause on valuations.
3731 2018-02-24 14:53:30 #RT @realDonaldTrump: RT @realDonaldTrump: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
3732 2018-02-24 14:53:05 Yes many stocks are invested in gun manufacturers. It’s not just teachers. I guess we need to change that. Right ...#Vanguard ?
3733 2018-02-24 14:52:42 Hayyyy stocks nanaman
3734 2018-02-24 14:52:25 First it will be bump stocks, which most people think is reasonable but they won't stop there.

Then it will be sights or grips

Then magazine capacity

They will play the long game and won't care if it takes 100 years to get the result they desire
3735 2018-02-24 14:52:12 Where in the constitution does it say a right to bear bump stocks and AR’s???
3736 2018-02-24 14:52:10 I want to know if there are people who are pro AR-15 and against bump stocks? If so does that mean you agree with a certain rate of rapid fire but not another? Serious question I have never thought about guns much in 57 years.
3737 2018-02-24 14:50:31 I support a ban on assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  RT if you agree and let them know.                             @GOP @realDonaldTrump @NRA @TheDemocrats
3738 2018-02-24 14:50:11 All the laws out there have not stopped DWI, domestic violence, and yes, murder.  Blowing smoke at the public saying they will be safer with a new rule in the books is ludicrous.  They should regulate the bump stocks, just as they already do with fully auto weapons & silencers.
3739 2018-02-24 14:49:43 Is this a picture of a chart from 2009 of a penny stock? How is this relatable to stocks overall.
3740 2018-02-24 14:49:40 I have disagreed with @ScottforFlorida until now.  He has presented a practical solution: background checks with mental health checks, a police officer for every 1000 students, active shooter training for students & faculty, minimum age to buy would be 21. No bump stocks.
3741 2018-02-24 14:49:30 Looks like Florida is banning bump stocks.
3742 2018-02-24 14:49:09 Saturday morning, @realDonaldTrump retweeted himself from Feb 22, with a statement that read: “I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something.
3743 2018-02-24 14:47:56 "Bump stocks are like elastic bands" is the new line. I guess @smerconish wants to continue to deflect from what the majority of people want. A ban on assault weapons.
3744 2018-02-24 14:47:39 That’s The Truth!! They Would Lose Alot Of Stocks, and They Would Lose alot Of People! They would collapse!!
3745 2018-02-24 14:47:00 Your right to own assault weapons & bump stocks should not usurp the right of the public to be safe. We ban drugs that are not safe to public & dangerous products. The NRA party removed & prevented laws that were for the public's safety not for our rights but for money & power.
3746 2018-02-24 14:46:09 Well, I only used to use one of those companies. They forget, #conservatives are the ones with spending power. I’ve never met a #liberal that could balance a checkbook so, let’s watch and see who’s #stocks go down. For me, I’m renewing my #NRA membership.
3747 2018-02-24 14:45:01 Guesses as to how many people on TV currently refering to bump stocks know how they work?
3748 2018-02-24 14:44:42 Nooooo not my bump stocks :(
3749 2018-02-24 14:44:16 @Delta you sided with the wrong group. Trust me when I say there are more Americans that believe in the Constitution yet you proved you’re not one of them. Your stocks and company will diminish since you side with people wanting to do away with the 2nd amendment #BoycottDelta
3750 2018-02-24 14:43:48 $AAPL strong play, but I'll be taking some off the table next week. Good run from recent lows. Remain bullish w/ 200 TP #stocks$QQQ #markets
3751 2018-02-24 14:43:37 Um ... pretty sure you don’t have a constitutional right to bump stocks.

3753 2018-02-24 14:43:10 You can, from an objective data set (prod, demand, supply, stocks, through-put).  Seasonal is "norm", has not effect, per say.  Compare objective data to norm, attempt to explain deviation. Price, however, is + subjective, and this makes deviation from norm harder to explain.
3754 2018-02-24 14:42:38 Agree, Check your 401k folks, send letters to mutal funds, ask that they change out the gun stocks! #BoycottNRA , #BoycottNRAStocks, #BoycottNRASponsors
3755 2018-02-24 14:41:53 @laurenduca Lauren,
Gun stocks are doing poorly even with Trump and a Republican Congress doing everything in its power to get guns in the hands of everyone and a stock market going through the roof. American Outdoor Brands who manufactures the AR-15 is down over 57%!!

3757 2018-02-24 14:40:24 no buying and selling stocks is a way of investing and making money. But it has a lot of risks too. I'm looking for people that are interested in it. You're clearly not and that is 100% fine xD
3758 2018-02-24 14:40:23 Stocks are 100% safe bro. Crypto is for suckers. My financial advisor from Phoenix University told me
3759 2018-02-24 14:39:43 Also another good thing about @drake possibly coming to #teamadidas would be my Adidas Boost portfolio will be more diversified. #Stocks & #Sneaker talk...now we talking #Richuals  & 
3760 2018-02-24 14:39:40 @claycane bump stocks are device to make a technique easier to do the technique is called bump firing you can do this with a stiff finger a belt loop a pen really anything
3761 2018-02-24 14:39:30 Or- amazing advice and ability to control stocks but could be shorting them? Could be murky legally if anyone in the empire own shares

3767 2018-02-24 14:38:14 Increased refining & demand, to seasonality, reduced inflows from multiple sources, extra draw on heavy, due to decreased supply from PdVSA, MEX and other OPEC's. The ? is, how structural is lower level, & can refining run smoothly without safety stocks as we enter high season?

3773 2018-02-24 14:36:50 Good grief! Stop with the tired excuse that bad guys will always get weapons. It is a weapon of war. It’s only purpose is to kill and kill quickly and efficiently. If we do nothing we get nothing. First step is to ban them and large magazines and bump stocks.
3774 2018-02-24 14:36:22 Yes seems 3.06 was golden

3777 2018-02-24 14:35:13 I know, but it's easy to buy modifications to make them fire like an automatic. That's why we shouldn't have bump stocks, I mean look at how much damage was done in Las Vegas. The shooter had bump stocks on all of his semi-automatic weapons.
3778 2018-02-24 14:35:04 Bump stocks aren’t mentioned anywhere in our bill of rights. They can be banned.
3779 2018-02-24 14:35:01 Yup, got to wait till Monday to do anything annoyingly
3780 2018-02-24 14:35:00 Still trying to figure out what their not going in has to do with gun control, the NRA, or bump stocks. If teachers need to be unarmed human shields so that these clowns can protect our kids... I'll pass.
3781 2018-02-24 14:34:54 For me Investing in Stocks/bonds/mutualfunds/ Banks is a Good invts But investing in Cryptocurrency or Digital Currency will Give you Fortune in the Near Future.

3782 2018-02-24 14:34:38 There will always be human error.
Yes, better data, better law enforcement, tighter regulations.

BUT, MICHAEL: THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
America has too many guns.
Ban AR15s, high capacity mags, bump stocks. Universal BG Checks.
3783 2018-02-24 14:34:31 Your missing the point. NRA AND members are enabling mass shootings by the sale of bump stocks, weapons totally unsuitable for the public. If they self policed, background checks/mental conditions, stopped members selling guns privately and to under 21's????
3784 2018-02-24 14:34:22 Great to see @HowardMnisi23 back! Lions midfield stocks at full strength. Great to have 4 class players all available!
3785 2018-02-24 14:34:21 yes - will take a while - however back to the point. we agree on bump stocks and clips - i probably would go lower to 15-17 rounds.  tighten background checks - raise the age with military exemption and then debate the actual instruments available
3786 2018-02-24 14:34:19 Ban the sale of military grade weapons and rifle magazines with more than a 5 shot capacity AS WELL as bump stocks NOW, or you are an #NRA stooge. Stop expecting teachers & cops to clean up a hot mess yr NRA pals created. Ban all political donations from gun lobbyists now #Trump
3787 2018-02-24 14:34:05 Also called American Indian, Amerind, Amerindian, Native American. a member of the aboriginal people of America or of any of the aboriginal North or South American stocks, usually excluding the Eskimos.
3788 2018-02-24 14:34:01 Does he own some diabetes/insulin stocks?
3789 2018-02-24 14:33:18 One of them trucks were for sale by the other week 56k miles at £7000. If I had £7k id have been tempted but it was sold the next day
3790 2018-02-24 14:32:46 I sure won’t. I have contacted both my Stared and Federal Legislators requesting action to enact a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, closing gun show and online loopholes, and school safety. Not arming teachers!
3791 2018-02-24 14:31:50 Our right?   Last i checked the 2nd amendment allowed you to own a gun.  Doesnt say bump stocks
3792 2018-02-24 14:31:17 Fuel pump and fuel rail... about£1200 so yeah! It’s dead 
3793 2018-02-24 14:30:59 I'm as pro 2nd as they come. But the internal components of an automatic weapon are not the same as a semi auto and are not made to withstand those rates of fire. Bump stocks just destroy your firearm. They're stupid.
3794 2018-02-24 14:30:58 Exactly. Bump stocks are a diversion. Ask a surgeon what an AR 15 round does to the human body when it passes through and you will know the problem isn’t a bump stock but the weapon itself. They were not made for sport but to maim or kill with maximin damage.
3795 2018-02-24 14:30:38 Will your NRA $$ allow you to vote for 
-Background Checks for All Commercial Gun Sales, H.R.4240
-Closing the Bump-Stock Loophole Act, H.R.4168
-Gun Trafficking Prevention Act, H.R. 1475

3800 2018-02-24 14:29:16 SCOTUS has ruled the 2nd Amendment is not absolute. There can & are restrictions on types of guns & on gun sales. For example, it is legal & Constitutional to prevent gun sales to convicted felons. Bump stocks can be banned. You think guns are more important than human lives?
3801 2018-02-24 14:29:10 PnDs are just as common in stocks, especially in penny stocks.
3802 2018-02-24 14:28:44 No rights to bump stocks, scopes, gat cranks, or high capacity magazines. Second smendment only mentions "Arms".
3803 2018-02-24 14:28:15 @smerconish Sadly, gun control in the USA means having a keen eye and a steady hand.  #NRAKillsKids  suppose they’ll have to wait until senior conservative politicians loose family members to legal weapons of war.  Imagine if back then, they had “bump stocks” for their muskets!
3804 2018-02-24 14:28:10 @smerconish When kindergarteners are killed and they do nothing? After the largest mass shooting and they can’t even ban bump stocks?
Yeah, people get angry
3805 2018-02-24 14:27:53 Yes you have a right to want them. I do not believe you should have the right to own bump stocks, semi automatics nor assault weapons. Time for new hobbies. The tide is changing. #nomoreexcuses #bantheNRA
3806 2018-02-24 14:27:36 Yes they can run it as they wish, however, a concerted effort to overthrow our .gov is treason. They are just one small piece of the bigger picture.  Notice that this all happened when an SA bought up a big portion of their stocks? @realdonaldtrump?????
3807 2018-02-24 14:27:10 Yes... Calendars only on index. Cheap low Volitility trade. stocks volumes and bid ask spread does not allow for this strategy.
3808 2018-02-24 14:26:25 Sadly, gun control in the USA means having a keen eye and a steady hand.  #NRAKillsKids  I suppose they’ll just have to wait until senior conservative politicians loose more family members to legal weapons of war.  Imagine if back then, they had “bump stocks” for their muskets!
3809 2018-02-24 14:26:24 Oregon passed legislation 2/23/18 that expands who could be banned from owning guns & ammunition after conviction, adding stalkers, those under restraining order & non-live-in abusers. FL Gov Scott actually looking at banning bump stocks & raising min age for guns. #GunReformNow
3810 2018-02-24 14:26:23 Snapchat lost 1.3 billion in stocks. Do you think they’ll revert back? I only see them going more down if they don’t.
3811 2018-02-24 14:26:04 Why did you resind mental health background checks? Forget that u did that last year? After Vegas bump stocks were to be gone what happened?
3812 2018-02-24 14:25:51 I’ve been saying for a while now the @NRA does some really good things but they were getting a little Extreme. Why would they fight banning bump stocks ?? Makes no sense they just didn’t understand that sometimes that times are changing and you need to change with them
3813 2018-02-24 14:24:43 Constitution does not mention gat cranks or bump stocks or accessories. It mentions "Arms" not "and all present and future invented accessories".  So..no right to accessories.
3814 2018-02-24 14:24:19 As always great session Andy. Calendar spreads particularly for stocks, far month contracts are not very liquid. Should we just stick to index for this strategy
3815 2018-02-24 14:24:04 Auto stocks will be in focus as the auto companies will start announcing  monthly sales numbers for February 2018 starting from Thursday, 1 March  2018.
3816 2018-02-24 14:23:40 Please do not allow the age to be raised!!  This is incorrect.  Enforce background checks!!!  Get rid of bump stocks.  But NO to age increase!!
3817 2018-02-24 14:22:46 I don't think my IRA has any gun stocks, but not sure about the pension. Of course, that is out of my hands, GM has their own strategy and they don't listen to me.
3818 2018-02-24 14:22:45 Hey @bowhunt37, can you tell us why?

We hunt, we compete,  with bows and guns, and we're *for* disbanding the @NRA, making AR15's and bump stocks illegal, and gun ownership regulations and restrictions.
3819 2018-02-24 14:22:38 Where is an #enemy of the #US that requires a $700 billion/yr #military so that we are #safe? There isn't one. We are keeping #defense #industry #stocks at high values to benefit the #wealthy. That is the cause of the US #debt.
3820 2018-02-24 14:22:32 5) need to have guns to Protect against government, but have the armed officers from the same government protect our kids -  Arguments that sans logic.
6) If you ban Bump stocks the ban Rubber band too - another metally retarded gun owner’s request.
3821 2018-02-24 14:22:20 Hope someone is tracking their stocks to see how this plays out over the. Ok’ing months
3822 2018-02-24 14:21:48 And what about banning bump stocks, raising age to purchase age to 21 and background checks. Not a word in that speech

3828 2018-02-24 14:19:46 The AR-15 is the "street-legal" descendant of the M-16. It's lack of full auto-fire can be legally tweaked with things like bump stocks into practically having that capability.
3829 2018-02-24 14:19:23 People need to check their 401K investments and push for divestment from any corporate stocks associated with the NRA and gun manufacturers.  It’s very American to exercise your rights as a consumer.  This they would hear loud and clear.
3830 2018-02-24 14:18:59 During the bull market in bonds and stocks that began i the early 1980s, you saw that kind of return. And so people have come to expect it going forward as well. All sorts of models suggesting it's reasonable
3831 2018-02-24 14:18:21 My understanding is bump stocks just convert a regular rifle into an asult rifle so by doing away with this but not assault rifles not much an accompishment. Lets go back to guns that shoot one and only one bullet at a time. This gives target a chance.
3832 2018-02-24 14:18:02 @elonmusk JSR I own SpaceX until you call. Cancel all projects. Drive all stocks into the SNAKE PIT. CIA, go to Elon's house.
3833 2018-02-24 14:17:42 NRA members are not tied or caused these shooting. Eliminate bump stocks nation wide, increase age to 21 years to buy guns. And perform vetting every 3 years of gun owners to see if things changed. I am a gun owner and for these things.

3836 2018-02-24 14:16:37 It is a shame bump stocks were made legal under Obama. Thank goodness for Trump moving to make them illegal. I am the NRA and strong 2nd A supporter but support making bump stocks illegal. Only purpose is to circumvent full auto law Another Obama FU

3839 2018-02-24 14:15:23 Why do you need assault rifles, bump stocks why are they even legal? It's simple remove all guns from the general public, only have shot guns for farmers & ranchers, or subsistence hunting. No one needs hand guns or assault rifles automatic rifles.
3840 2018-02-24 14:15:00 The best time to sell stocks: a strong economy, close to full employment and rising interest rates.” Zweig
3841 2018-02-24 14:14:34 Who the hell are you? Who cares what you want, for some fucked-up reason? If you cared at all about the mass murders that have taken place using bump stocks (remember Las Vegas), you’d be happy to give up your precious bump stock. Why would you even want to use one?
3842 2018-02-24 14:14:21 What we didn't learn in elementary school (but should've ) from our parents/teachers. (Inverse rel'ship on Bonds) Buy bonds when high int rates; sell bonds when int rates go down.....near 1-2% (to capture price increases) invest all along in growth oriented stocks.
3843 2018-02-24 14:13:32 I started thinking after the Vegas shooting. If the shooter did NOT have the bump stocks that would have ment he would have had to actually aim the gun, and would that have caused the casualty count to actually have increased?
3844 2018-02-24 14:13:03 See it occur in stocks too. Usually a stop loss hunting algo
3845 2018-02-24 14:12:48 Pretty sure bump stocks are already illegal ?
3846 2018-02-24 14:12:14 @Annakhait bump stocks make a gun seem automatic and fire continuously. No its not a machine gun its in between an automatic gun and semi-auto. Also bump stock make a gun less accurate, so yeah um good argument. If you say its fun or i need it that makes no sense.
3847 2018-02-24 14:12:09 Where the line becomes blurred is when aftermarket items, such as bump stocks, are used to push the envelope from semi-auto towards near full-auto. Key word being “near.” That is where the discussion needs to be.
3848 2018-02-24 14:11:56 Tighten up a few holes, maybe raise age and eliminate bump stocks but no one wants to take all guns away.
3849 2018-02-24 14:11:46 Totally behind improving the background check. However raising the age to 21 and banning bump stocks seems unnecessary. We should do better at enforcing the current gun laws we have & law enforcement agencies local & national need to be more proactive when receiving tips
3850 2018-02-24 14:11:27 For the long suffering retired looking for income, a 4% yielding bond will be very attractive compared to dividend paying stocks to this street economist!
3851 2018-02-24 14:11:23 Ok. Let's get literal. 2A doesn't "mention" guns either, but "arms", which includes bump stocks. 
3852 2018-02-24 14:11:07 Sent u reply from the article you posted. I think we will find that high velocity weapons with large clips and bump stocks will be banned by many states
3853 2018-02-24 14:11:04 "look back in history to get your answer"

Yep, without bump stocks, we never would have won the revolutionary war folks. Come on, look at history!

3857 2018-02-24 14:08:15 And d’y’notice that every time something like this happens, gun sales (specifically assault weapons — more specifically, I reckon, AR-15) go through the roof and gun stocks on the NYSE soar. It’s sickening. #pathetic #NeverAgain
3858 2018-02-24 14:07:45 Why did 4 officers stay outside!?
3859 2018-02-24 14:07:27 There will always be human error. And that’s why we also need fewer guns. Ban weapons of war, high capacity mags, bump stocks & yes to universal background checks.
3860 2018-02-24 14:06:40 Guarantee you that bump stocks are illegal by the end of the year.
3861 2018-02-24 14:06:11 Also even if you do the things guns will still be on the street kids will still have them and bump stocks will still be owned by the public all your doing is turning people into criminals look at new York city there are still guns their and they're illegal
3862 2018-02-24 14:05:42 The function of the cartoon absurdity is to move the needle on what feels normal.  Makes the status quo feel more acceptable.  So if they only ban bump stocks, it feels like a big improvement. He’s done this over and over again, keeping the dialectical upper hand
3863 2018-02-24 14:04:36 #VRS Small cap stocks are generally defined as the stock of publicly traded companies that have a market capitalization ranging from $300 million to about $2 billion. Neil you learn some thing everyday from BMD...  :)
3864 2018-02-24 14:04:20 Best plan: Increase age of rifle purchase to 21, NO more bump stocks, & use retired military/law inforcement personnel to serve as extra security in schools.
3865 2018-02-24 14:04:10 Gee... what could Govt employees due with inside info that would affect oil market prices?!? Its not like Trump appointees have ever used their positions for personal gain (except for Tom Price w HC stocks or the CDC Dir w tobaco stocks, or... you get the gist! They get paid!)
3866 2018-02-24 14:03:42 The 2nd Amendment only mentions arms, not  bump stocks, magazines, or other accessories. These things are not a guaranteed right.
3867 2018-02-24 14:03:14 Bump stocks should be legal and 21 is too high for rifles
3868 2018-02-24 14:02:46 I agree with better background check. I have no love-loss for bump-stocks, never knew what it was till Vegas shooting. I feel our freedoms are being taken away, 1 by 1. Give the democrats an inch they will take it all.
3869 2018-02-24 14:02:38 A few months ago, NRA executives issued a public statement calling for more strict regulation of bump stocks. In 1997, an NRA vice president publicly stated that there is "no need or reason" for private citizens to own an AK-47 rifle. What is your version of the 2nd?
3870 2018-02-24 14:02:38 All those deaths in Vegas couldn’t get bump stocks banned but a bunch of traumatized kids may. Let’s keep handing them the football
3871 2018-02-24 14:02:16 Trump write a DAMN Executive Order Banning Bump Stocks, You seem Capable of Writing Executive Orders To Ban everything else, why Not Bump Stock, to Afraid of the NRA??
3872 2018-02-24 14:01:38 Bump stocks are NOT part of the 2nd Amendment.
3873 2018-02-24 14:01:26 Agreed. Stocks will go lower and that's based on investor opinion and not actual sales. But the problem is if there is still that high demand for the products the vacuum needs to be filled. The demand is what needs to diminish.

3875 2018-02-24 14:00:38 Can you go into more details on your plan? I doesn't seem very effective, except regulating bump stocks. Will the Mental Health background checks steer people away from getting Mental Health checks for fear of losing their guns? What are the criteria for mental health?
3876 2018-02-24 14:00:34 Raising the legal age of purchasing a firearm to at least 21. Banning assault rifles, high-capacity or extended magazines and bump stocks.  Close any loopholes that allow buyers to skip background checks. Enact meaningful consequences when gun sellers do not follow regulations...

3879 2018-02-24 13:59:39 Thanks for you session.Appreciate for your help on novice. Pls share the links where we can get IV Rank or IV percentile details for nse stocks/nifty
3880 2018-02-24 13:58:24 Russian troll is he only excuse for this pathetic argument. Justice Scalia determined that 2nd amendment does not provide civilians a right to have weapons of war. As for bump stocks, it’s not a gun. It’s not protected under 2nd amend. Do your homework
3881 2018-02-24 13:58:13 Even if it worked, the crazies would just move to parking lots, sporting events, concerts, churches,... need comprehensive federal reform-ban private sales, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, require waiting periods and thorough background checks with nation-wide data base.
3882 2018-02-24 13:56:49 I agree! Kudos to these kids and parents for waking people up. They’re making change happen. They even got Trump (can’t stand him) to agree to try to get stricter background checks and try to ban bump stocks. I really wish he’d push for an assault weapons ban too.
3883 2018-02-24 13:56:43 I visited Mi Home Kolkata yesterday they said stocks not available... When did you get yesterday???
3884 2018-02-24 13:56:31 Bump stocks are not covered by "arms" a bump stock is not an armament, it is a modification.
3885 2018-02-24 13:56:09 He LITERALLY just compared banning bump stocks to banning rubber bands on CNN.
3886 2018-02-24 13:55:46 It is absolutely NOT YOUR RIGHT to buy/own bumpn stocks! No one needs a bump stock unlesss they’re planning on mass killing anything. #CommonSenseGunControl
3887 2018-02-24 13:55:40 #DivestNRA  Pension funds, investment funds— knee them in the stocks sac.
3888 2018-02-24 13:55:31 Normally, the gun stocks go up.  If there are new regulations coming, everyone must rush to the gun shop and buy more guns. Anyway, that's the theory.
3889 2018-02-24 13:55:27 Now let’s watch these companies stocks start going down the shitter. You have to wonder what genius PR person suggested to their admin to do such a stupid thing.
3890 2018-02-24 13:55:12 stupid idea!! It’s time to #ProtectOurChildren! Another father turned in his sonyesterday for planning similar event & surrendered the GUNS to officials! The more shootings there are, there will be more copy cat shootings. NO BUMP STOCKS! AGE 21, STRICKER BACKGROUNDS #NeverAgain
3891 2018-02-24 13:55:03 I don’t do long term holds for penny stocks. Too much research and risk. Most penny stocks are .
3892 2018-02-24 13:54:58 Claramente. Los "chiches" llamativos como BUK, T-72 y MSTA son para el desfile y mensaje a los vecinos. Para EEUU el problema está en los stocks de FAL, AK, Igla-S y RPG en una Venezuela sumida en anarquismo, todos de interés para radicales islamicos e "insurgentes criminales".

3894 2018-02-24 13:54:24 So, do the NRA have top ranking officials with stocks invested in anti-net neutrality companies?

Are they run by the same people?

What’s the game here?

Anybody, #mueller ? #mueller ?
3895 2018-02-24 13:53:54 Nice try but you’re about to find out that the tax cut really only benefits the rich and will explode the deficit. That combined with the new budget will drastically increase Treasury borrowing and therefore interest rates. Down go stocks and the economy!
3896 2018-02-24 13:53:36 Trump makes push to strengthen background checks, remove bump stocks, and raise ages.... that’s good right?! How can people complain about this??? Obama didn’t do a damn thing and he was praised! How backwards
3897 2018-02-24 13:53:26 @SenateGOP @HouseGOP We own 2 guns. We are Democrats. Stop spewing false assertions that Dems want to take away the right to own guns. I do not believe AR-15s, bump stocks & assault weapons should be sold to citizens. Military use only! We live in an increasingly violent USA.
3898 2018-02-24 13:52:50 gAG Sessions is too busy banning bump stocks and making sure the deep state 'MERICAphobes  have even more access to patriots info to deny them firearm purchases while the same fbi arranges/allows more terrorists attacks
3899 2018-02-24 13:52:49 I don’t sleep well at all knowing angry white men with AR-15s & bump stocks are allowed to roam at will through our streets gunning down people at concerts, churches, & our kids at school. That bothers me. I wish it bothered more folks like you. #BanAssaultWeapons #NeverAgain
3900 2018-02-24 13:52:38 70 stocks away from winning rot6 without dropping a game.

"All he needs is 70 grabs!"
3901 2018-02-24 13:52:32 and all of that would make you a slightly better president if you didn't push and remove legislation preventing backgroundchecks on mentally ill before out of spite over obama.
also, bump stocks aren't the real problem and you know it.
3902 2018-02-24 13:52:27 We will be selling EYC bobble  hats at today's game at only £2  normally £8.50 (while stocks  last) see Nicky at the snack bar
3903 2018-02-24 13:52:15 Lol. It isn't your right to own a bump stock. Arms sure, bump stocks, supressors,  etc aren't on the covered at all tho my friend.
3904 2018-02-24 13:51:42 McDonald's now if I was a Corp I could buy back my stocks give CEOs and shareholders more money what a scam
3905 2018-02-24 13:51:16 You’re an ass, you’re mean and a #FakeChristian. I don’t want your F’in guns. I firmly believe if the founders knew about bump stocks and automated weapons, they would have been more specific. Children are dying- they also have rights- life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
3906 2018-02-24 13:50:33 I’m for many regulations, including no bump stocks, mental health exams, etc.  I will be 1st to sign up for one, every 6 months, if you want. But an AR-15 is as deadly as 100s of other rifles. It’s popular & thus why many have been used. But a AR ban won’t take those 100s away.
3907 2018-02-24 13:50:29 The letter: (1) Tax reform is good for Berkshire, but will lead to earnings choppiness in the future. (2) Wall Street pros are mostly full of shit charge too much. (3) If you can't handle nasty drawdowns, stay away from stocks. (4) Simple > complex. (5) Stay away from leverage.
3908 2018-02-24 13:50:13 I note the word CULT in your user name.  Take your fallen angel butt out of the arena over our #2A rights. Bump stocks are Not the issue. Hands off our gun rights. Hunting rifles are more deadly than a 5.56 being shot. Get a clue on what your talking about #guns #NoMoreGunLaws
3909 2018-02-24 13:50:08 Not looking for a fight, but bump stocks allow physically-disabled Vets to have their right to own and operate a gun they fought and gave their body to defend. Gun laws exist and are sufficient when followed and law enforcement is not hiding behind their vehicles in fear.
3910 2018-02-24 13:50:06 Senator Michael Williams (@williamsforga) was just on CNN comparing the banning of bump stocks to outlawing rubber bands.

Without blinking, I might add.
#NRABloodMoney
3911 2018-02-24 13:48:34 I looked at the doc.  It's there a classifiable difference in semiautomatic rifles that are modifiable like the AR-15, mini-14? My question has to do with the ability to use larger magazines, bump stocks.
3912 2018-02-24 13:48:32 In other words, don't take the bait. This is NOT about school security or mental health. It's about sensible measures to reduce access to firearms for those who are a threat to themselves and others. It's about red flag laws, banning bump stocks, & more rigorous background checks
3913 2018-02-24 13:47:42 I think the devil is in the details. There is no perfect solution to this situation. I personally see no need to own an AR15 or bump stocks but I wouldn't stop others from owning them.
3914 2018-02-24 13:47:42 I just start investing in stocks. Want to test the water on penny stocks. How should I approach it? Any advice be appreciated!
#thankyou
3915 2018-02-24 13:47:41 Thank you @jpmorganfunds for holding <0.01% of gun stocks in the JNSIX Smart Retirement fund.  Any chance you'll get that down to 0.00% in gun and ammo manufacturer/dealer stocks? #ENOUGH #SeekingZeroGunStocksinmyPortfolio
3916 2018-02-24 13:47:36 Am not discrediting his information but this was such a bull market that even Pidi will have made money recommending stocks to buy and hold to its Master,no?
3917 2018-02-24 13:47:36 Thanks. Was about to shift some holdings. Will check my @Fidelity and stop assuming there is any of my holdings that are touched by gun stocks!!
3918 2018-02-24 13:47:19 I didn't mean no interest, it's a great idea. Everyone stocks WMH, GW etc, but getting niche companies out there is totally worthwhile. It's effectively what I do with the female minis and that works!
3919 2018-02-24 13:47:15 And I cannot support any laws passed under the guise of it being "for the greater good" if the people supporting this ban are ignorant of what they're gunning for

Pun intended of course.

I can support bans on modifications like mag sizes and bump stocks, but not weapons
3920 2018-02-24 13:46:58 @Fidelity I have all my retirement funds invested with you but I will be reconsidering that quickly if you do not get out of gun stocks. Kids lives and our safety at events is more import than the money made by investing in death

If you really believe that, why not Short the stocks and report back to us about your wise investment decisions.  If you want a tip MetLife is your best bet for a Short - but I'm sure you knew that.
3923 2018-02-24 13:46:32 I don’t think too many people want to get rid of all guns. They just want assault style weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks banned. The damage that an AR does is catastrophic.
3924 2018-02-24 13:45:39 So now you can't buy bump stocks. Y'all better wake up

3927 2018-02-24 13:43:32 Michael Williams , a state Senator from Georgia , who is raffling off a bump stock , compared bump stocks to rubber bands  ... WTF is wrong with this idiot
3928 2018-02-24 13:43:17 Bump stocks were approved for sale under the Obama administration.
3929 2018-02-24 13:43:09 Very true. Americans don't have to give up their rights, but strengthen them. Universal and accurate background checks, a waiting period, no bump stocks, training and change the age to 21. Hopefully right and left sides can find a compromise.
3930 2018-02-24 13:43:04 Financial fraud.......not sure what that means.....most advisors can't pick stocks with accuracy. I would consider that fraud.
3931 2018-02-24 13:43:00 I'm going to guess at some point in the very near future, at a fund managers meeting for tgese companies, they'll make a decision to get out first on gun manufacturer stocks, etc.

To paraphrase old Wall St saying, they will not try to catch a falling social and financial knife!
3932 2018-02-24 13:41:55 If the government is going to ban bump stocks , do it right ! Offer a 3 month amnesty to turn them in, then after that a mandatory 5 years in prison for each one you're caught with ! Put some teeth in the ban !
3933 2018-02-24 13:41:03 Georgia State Senator Michael Williams is an embarrassment.  He's the Republican giving away Bump Stocks & supporting arming teachers in schools. He's obviously another Republican idiot bought & paid for by the NRA. Next Williams will want to arm all the students too.
3934 2018-02-24 13:41:01 I had no idea "bump stocks" was written in the constitution.
3935 2018-02-24 13:40:45 It takes about 5 minutes to turn your semi auto weapon into an automatic....without a bump stock..... ban the stocks but ban the guns that shoot these multiple round high powered bullets to the general public!
3936 2018-02-24 13:40:41 Dude, did you just equate banning bump stocks to banning 'rubber bands'?

3938 2018-02-24 13:40:34 The only reason DT wants guns in school is so that it can be attached 2 the bill 4 better background chks & a ban 2 bump stocks! By doing this he/GOP know it won't pass in Senate, thus satisfying NRA's no gun regulation order! NRA OWNS DT/GOP!!! /GOP/NRA
3939 2018-02-24 13:40:10 Yes the nra don't fire the bullets themselves but make sure the guns are easily accessible to every nutjob or criminal wanting to do harm.  They won't even allow the ban of bump stocks after las vegas....this is a terrible terrible organization.

3948 2018-02-24 13:37:27 Bump stocks should be illegal and regulated. Most agree on that there’s one way to agree.
3949 2018-02-24 13:37:24 Even if you accept that to be true, for the purposes of compromising with the crazies, the only place they would need 30 round magazines is locked up in a secure safe 24x7  away from their rifle ready for that fateful day. With their bump stocks, folding stocks & silencers.
3950 2018-02-24 13:37:19 @cnn legislator from Georgia states banning bump stocks won’t work. Says a rubber band will do same thing. Asks should we ban rubber bands? No, sir. We should ban assault rifles.

3958 2018-02-24 13:34:26 no one is taking away your right to own a hand gun for protection of rifle for hunting. You are NOT in the military and have no reason to own assault rifles or bump stocks
3959 2018-02-24 13:34:04 Bump stocks turn legal weapons into illegal weapons. That’s why they must and are being banned.
3960 2018-02-24 13:33:54 bump stocks are legal. Do not change that. Its a mental/ discipline issue, not being able to punish kids for doing wrong.
3961 2018-02-24 13:33:30 I couldn't care less about bump stocks, but 21 years and background checks I'll take gladly. So, good job if you can get that done.
3962 2018-02-24 13:33:06 it is not your right to own military type weapons. Your profile says God first? God said "Thou shalt not kill" The purpose of assault weapons and bump stocks is to kill. America's right is to keep our children safe, Lay off the lives of our children!!
3963 2018-02-24 13:32:50 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
3964 2018-02-24 13:31:46 Kudos to Florida Gov. RICK SCOTT. He has RATIONAL PLAN to PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. Age 21 to purchase, ban BUMP STOCKS, detailed background checks to weed out mentally ill purchasing weapons. Metal detectors and armed guards in schools.

3974 2018-02-24 13:28:13 What 'looming correction'? Its done. The bears could only manage 2754-2697. The 2800s are due in March. Certain stocks, such as $X, $MU, $INTC $BAC are highly suggestive of far higher levels in the mid term. Seriously, a Feb' monthly close >$40 for X has main market implications.

3982 2018-02-24 13:28:06 Yep, put a 1/2" band-aid on a broken arm. That's how much good banning bump stocks will do. And who signed a bill letting mentally ill people buy guns? You did, dip.

4047 2018-02-24 13:23:46 I respect you, I follow you and retweet your comments all the time.  I’m fully in favor of gun control to prevent these tragedies.  But this teeet is ridiculous and poorly researched. No semi-auto rifle fires 10 rounds per second.  And bump stocks don’t grant you that either.
4048 2018-02-24 13:23:02 Love these business for taking a stand to the ultimate bully-@NRA! It's not caving in! It's doing the right thing for their company. Look at the stock market this week! Gun stocks took a big hit! If that is happening on Wall Street...
4049 2018-02-24 13:22:25 I need to know which stocks they suggest buying
4050 2018-02-24 13:22:17 I think they use full automatic, meaning they don't have to cock it each time. Here people just buy bump stocks to achieve the same effect. Ar15 is the "civillian" version of the army issued rifle.
4051 2018-02-24 13:22:11 just bought out my stocks with @snapchat 
you guys fucked up with this update
fucking do something @snapchatsupport
4052 2018-02-24 13:21:47 I'm calling on the NRA to Ban Bump Stocks on the MS 13.
4053 2018-02-24 13:21:04 Caza is basically hunting. Once again, no one is asking to ban hunting rifles or pistols. It’s the ones that can be used to kill with so many rounds in one click. This gun fetish that has nothing to do with sports is ridiculous. Heck, your president wants to ban bump stocks.
4054 2018-02-24 13:20:40 @realDonaldTrump @SenateFloor @HouseFloor Can:t believe you haven't outlawed bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting. Now the Florida shooting. Outlaw bump stocks, outlaw suppressors, no concealed weapons reciprocity law, raise the age to 21, close the background check loopholes
4055 2018-02-24 13:20:14 Few stocks only
4056 2018-02-24 13:19:39 
4057 2018-02-24 13:19:37 Just heard the phrase "ban on bump stocks", as if it were meaningful. A ban on #bumpstocks is a #joke & the purveyors of it are too. Anyone can make one.
4058 2018-02-24 13:19:31 Why did 4 officers  do nothing! Sheriff knew at time of speech! More lies to advance agenda.
4059 2018-02-24 13:19:21 They must own gun manufacturer stocks. Not enough money made during Obama presidency. They will need a  new fear tactic now.
4060 2018-02-24 13:18:17 True.  Or it could be lack of knowledge.  In Vegas bump stocks basically made volleys nearly automatic.  All bad shit
4061 2018-02-24 13:18:04 How dumb is this guy. I love hearing these media idiots talk about weapons and bump stocks, magazine size and they have no idea what they are talking about.
4062 2018-02-24 13:18:01 I am comforted slightly by the fact he is here rather than in the USA, where I suspect he’d be putting bump stocks on his automatic rifles...from mommy’s basement.
4063 2018-02-24 13:17:35 If you think bump fire stocks are a problem, you truly have no clue what you’re talking about.

4067 2018-02-24 13:15:19 Missed the part in 2nd amendment where it mentions bump stocks
4068 2018-02-24 13:15:19 Invest in stocks girls. Not these niggas.
4069 2018-02-24 13:15:10 But I am a firm believer in our bill of rights. The 10 first. I do support raising the gun age law to 21. And sure let's get rid of bump stocks. But I don't believe we will ever get to the point of banning all guns.
4070 2018-02-24 13:14:40 I still don’t get how banning assault weapons, bump stocks, improving background checks, etc, violates anyone’s 2nd amendment rights and I haven’t heard anyone explain that either, perhaps bc they can’t?
4071 2018-02-24 13:13:58 I got you sista
4072 2018-02-24 13:13:02 Does it reallt matter that they've never committed a mass shooting though? IIRC the NRA was fervently AGAINST banning bump stocks, which allowed the Vegas shooter to do what he did. The NRA is the reason why these guns are not regulated, whether you like it or not.
4073 2018-02-24 13:12:24 @realDonaldTrump AT THE VERY LEAST EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS, PLUG THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE, BAN BUMP STOCKS. RAISE THE AGE LIMIT. YOU CAN BE THE PRESIDENT WHO FINALLY TAKE STEPS TO FIX THIS INSANITY! ITS YOUR DECISION
4074 2018-02-24 13:11:13 This woman is so selfish.  She wants to keep her fun while kids die.  No need for assault rifle to "protect" yourself.  Or bump stocks, or high capacity magazines.

4088 2018-02-24 13:00:49 The Vegas shooter did not have an automatic weapon.  He had a bump stock on a semiautomatic rifle.  Fires nowhere near the rate of a full automatic.  The barrel will get hot and jam, that’s why he had multiple rifles.  I wouldn’t mind seeing bump stocks banned.
4089 2018-02-24 12:59:58 Scapegoat security & police don't matter.
Don't lose sight of the goals: BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS/HIGH COUNT MAGS; UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS; MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.

"Maybe the clerk who sold coffee to the cops didn't put enough cafiene in it" IS ALL DISTRACTION.
4090 2018-02-24 12:59:30 As expected, US stocks & shift overseas.
4091 2018-02-24 12:57:37 Bump stocks make guns extremely inaccurate
4092 2018-02-24 12:56:15 @realDonaldTrump’s idea to arm teachers is a weapon of mass destraction. Don’t be fooled. He isn’t talking about raising the age to 21 for anyone to buy a rifle. Keep Trump on the same page with us! Must improve background checks, ban bump stocks and fund mental health programs!
4093 2018-02-24 12:55:40 Mary, only 4 bump stocks and 1 trigger crank have been "turned in voluntarily" in MA since that law went into affect. There are likely 100's in the state. And Herr Healey did not ban AW. She wrote an illegal interpretation which is being fought in court. Not her job to create law

4096 2018-02-24 12:54:11 Assault weapons are ones that have select fire capability including full auto. These have been banned for the public since 1986. It didn’t deter crime. Long story short, this is a slippery slope and it seems Trump is on the edge by proposing to ban bump stocks.
4097 2018-02-24 12:51:52 What is a laughing stocks?
4098 2018-02-24 12:51:18 Didnt know the firearms OEM stocks needed a boost with the "ban all guns" talk

4100 2018-02-24 12:50:49 The NRA loving insane gun nuts are the Stupid.The kids are smart enough to see that AR-15's are for hunting people & they want this insanity to stop. GOP & fox hate tv says make AR-15's easier to get. "bump stocks" hell yea yea we want them.The kids are the smart ones.
4101 2018-02-24 12:49:32 These memes are stupid af I said you don’t need a SEMI AUTO for hunting that means rifles with wood stocks as well
4102 2018-02-24 12:49:04 The NRA does support changing ATF regulations regarding bump stocks, but they actively oppose any & all actual laws that pertain to guns because it's easier to go back & change an ATF regulation than it is to undo a law.
4103 2018-02-24 12:48:02 That's why NRA & Republicans denied removal of bump stocks after Las Vegas.  You make no sense.  And now your CPAC Republicans are exposed for everyone to see!
4104 2018-02-24 12:47:31 spoken like a true economist. I bet you have stocks in PSEI too.
4105 2018-02-24 12:47:07 An AR-15 is not a weapon of war. It's a one pull one bullet semiautomatic rifle. I own one so I know this. I am against bump stocks but not sure how you could prevent people from getting them. Or perhaps even 3D printing one. You can 3d print a gun. Why not a bump stock?
4106 2018-02-24 12:46:18 NRA wants bump stocks to be regulated through ATF, not by laws passed by Congress. NRA won't support any bill making its way through the Senate and indeed will do their best to lobby against it.
4107 2018-02-24 12:45:00 nako mamshi kung pwede lang hays kaso wala na raw stocks i cri :-(((
4108 2018-02-24 12:42:10 The Obama administration did not "legalize" bump stocks. Because of their deign and because of the way firearm regulations are worded, the ATF does not have the authority to classify them as illegal. They just happened to come out while Obama was President.
4109 2018-02-24 12:41:37 Then why did they call for a ban on bumpstocks stocks, before Vegas. @NativeTexan74 @TerryCardwell @thehill @NRA
4110 2018-02-24 12:40:08 ... so you also for example justify, that nobody is allowed to buy stocks, because 1% of them are crazy brokers? 

or that cannabis should always be illegal, because 1% gets addicted or get psychical problems? i know people who've become crazy over cannabis.
4111 2018-02-24 12:39:54 pls twitter stocks alr falling forever without any criticism lol
4112 2018-02-24 12:39:50 Nyahahaha! From dialtone to stocks real quick.
4113 2018-02-24 12:39:46 Another sign something is different. Often stocks go up after a shooting, because sales rise on fears of "gun-grabbing." And in the past investors could safely assume nothing legislatively would get done. They are spooked, as is the NRA, whose corporate support is tanking.
4114 2018-02-24 12:38:50 He has stepped and is leading Chuck. He wants a re-vamp if background checks and bump stocks prohibited. I believe the latter is in your arena so what are you clowns doing about it? Maybe your so called elite FBI could work on the background check issue and take threats seriously
4115 2018-02-24 12:37:46 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Ban high capacity magazines
3. Ban armor-piercing bullets
4. Ban personal ownership of assault weapons but allow use in gun ranges
5. Require registration of ALL guns
6. Require 3 day waiting period for purchase
7. Fix background check system

4117 2018-02-24 12:37:28 You should be happy, because 2 of those things you suggested are already laws.

Curious why armor-piercing is on the list tho - have they been an issue as far as you can tell?

And banning bump stocks /limiting mag size would have almost no effect.
4118 2018-02-24 12:34:32 Then speak out against bump fire stocks. I think they’re nuts. But saying a semi can “easily” fire 10 rounds a second is inaccurate
4119 2018-02-24 12:34:30 It's the fiduciary duty of pension fund managers to get a good return on the investments.

If gun maker stocks are undervalued and going to gain in value, yes

If gun maker stocks are overvalued and likely to lose value, no

This isn't hard
4120 2018-02-24 12:33:52 Instead of distributing freebies on fair price shops and fill the pockets of fair  price shops holders who send large stocks to black market at night,distribute it to who really deserve it.
4121 2018-02-24 12:33:49 At Columbine, didn't multiple cops storm the building?   It didn't matter, it doesn't take much time at all w/ even a semi-auto rifle to take out a bunch of people...  W/ a semi-auto and bumps stocks, even less.
4122 2018-02-24 12:33:20 @cspanwj Note that we're discussing the @NRA's insane idea, rather than common-sense gun legislation:
- universal background checks
- raising purchasing age to 21
- ban bump stocks

4164 2018-02-24 11:40:45 No criminal will ever follow a law passed!  Stricter vetting, raising the age to 21 without a military exemption, ban on public purchase of bump stocks and similar modifications at any age but come on...that’s not solving the issue - “gun free zones” = open invite to criminals!
4165 2018-02-24 11:40:17 I’ve said this Many times, cryptos shouldn’t get their MC from circulating supply alone Some stocks are in the millions and billions of shares, and don’t get evaluated like crypto does And not all crypto are the same and shouldn’t be lumped into one another

4173 2018-02-24 11:34:53 Sometimes I believed that the stock markets are merely dictated by sectors. That's where the trending of buying stocks are leading us too. So far as I see the technology sector is on the rise and it is trending, leading the way like the NFLX, AAPL and FB, even the TWTR too.
4174 2018-02-24 11:34:35 So I just came up with an idea for an app, maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't...

But it could change the world we live in.

It wouldn't make me money,money would be based on government funding/stocks etc

I'm a Dem & believe in 2a,protect your home/family,hunt,target shoot..but there has to be restrictions,AR15/Bump stocks hell no,Universal background checks hell yes,dont sell to those on "No Fly Zone",criminals,those with restraining orders,domestic violence, hell yes.
4177 2018-02-24 11:32:37 But it’s not an artwork  Since I’m doing a GO, i have stocks here from a fansite goods, so i want sell it, and sponsor some of it as well, is it okay?

4179 2018-02-24 11:30:07 If the investor doesn't have enough time and skill to investigate individual stocks or enough money to diversify a portfolio, the right thing to do is to invest in exchange-traded funds that give you exposure to asset classes. #SaturdayThoughts @NSEIndia

4197 2018-02-24 11:16:13 So we can't even ban bump stocks (which are useless anyways) and our background check system has holes which we can't even plug much less make it harder to by certain weapons or accessories which are dangerous or not really needed. Ah well. At least *you* feel clever.
4198 2018-02-24 11:16:01 Identifying Value stocks and Growth stocks takes huge time and effort. We begin to wonder - Why doesn't every company try to be a value/growth stock? We find - Great entrepreneurs are just 1% of the whole lot.
4199 2018-02-24 11:15:26 Bump firing with your belt loop and a bump stock both take a bit of practice, but in the end achieve the same fire rate / effect. YouTube "bump firing". Regulating bump stocks won't stop people from converting a semiautomatic into an automatic (very easy) or bump firing.

4203 2018-02-24 11:11:59 The NRA has been on record opposing bump stocks, at least as far back as the Obama Administration who refused to take action to ban them. I personally don't see a need for them but the same ones that invented them will be the ones to invent new ways to modify other guns.
4204 2018-02-24 11:08:35 You can get your hands on anything, if you can't find it you make it...
Raising the age and banning bump stocks won't save people.

4208 2018-02-24 11:04:37 Really.   So listening to the survivors and the families of victims is nothing.  So having bump stocks banned  is nothing.   So bringing together  all manner of experts to discuss real changes is nothing  and calling on  Congress to change laws is nothing.  Stupid ignore facts.

4222 2018-02-24 10:45:59 @juliettekayyem So glad you went as far to say bump stocks need to be eliminated for sale to the general public, but wish you would've also included AR-15s.  The 2nd Amendment isn't under threat.  Our children are.  You're a very intelligent person.  Please consider this.  Peace.

4228 2018-02-24 10:40:25 1) AR-15s cannot be converted to fully automatic. Bump-stocks only help you pull the trigger faster. 
2) despite this, they still account for vastly fewer fatalities than handguns.

4230 2018-02-24 10:37:08 There is no pot - it’s invested in stocks, shares, bonds etc, which can go down as well as up. Additionally, people are paying into pensions designed to provide 10-15 years of post retirement income and needing 15-30 years. Thus, the employer (or the state) has to subsidise.
4231 2018-02-24 10:36:09 It’s interesting to see the non-financial orientated public’s view of short selling.

4270 2018-02-24 09:55:44 I disagree, this time feels distinctly different. Florida's Governor Rick Scott has already put into motion a plan to drastically restrict (compared to now) gun sales in Florida, and with a few more Senate seats the Dems could easily get bump stocks banned.

By analogy, categorically "banning bump stocks" has likewise ZERO net effect of the underlying CAUSE of the mass shootings. To restate the obvious, the end that fires the bullets (i.e., how rapidly) is what matters- not the stock of the gun.

4314 2018-02-24 08:54:14 Also #DavidHogg’s rhetoric will backfire when millions of panicked gun owners flood the #NRA with donations and many non gun owners buy semi autos out of fear they may be banned. Gun stocks will soar through the roof. They always do during “gun panics!”

4346 2018-02-24 08:25:19 Guns are PART of the problem, we can keep the #2ndAmendment & keep our hand guns & legal hunting weapons but we NEED to BAN civilian access to silencers, conversion kits, bump stocks and automatic military weapons & legal age to purchase/own up to 21!
4347 2018-02-24 08:24:55 And not all mass shootings utilized one particular type of weapon.
I agree that there should be stronger background checks, longer waiting periods for legal purchases and definitely ban bump stocks. None of which would infringe on the freedoms of responsible gun owners.

4351 2018-02-24 08:17:05 The modifications are what turns it into a “weapon of war” as these brainwashed kids and liberals call it. Just ban the modifications and get stricter background checks. The gun doesn’t have to go. Banning bump stocks is a start theyre what turns them into machine guns.

These are important steps. I want you to ban the semi automatics.

4362 2018-02-24 08:11:02 Bump stocks are so useless in real life situation unless you are spraying and praying in compact  quarters with lots of compact targets inside  that I see no practical or commercial value in keeping them. Get rid of them. Only crazies would use them anyway

4380 2018-02-24 07:55:01 What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other.

BAN AR-15'S BAN BUMP STOCKS! SAY IT SAY THE @NRA WANTS TO BAN ASSAULT RIFLES AND BUMP STOCKS! BUT YOU WON'T. THE @NRA WON'T
4396 2018-02-24 07:35:45 how big is the stocks??
4397 2018-02-24 07:35:33 Yes you’re saying that because you’re a packer stocks cmon
4398 2018-02-24 07:35:16 Make one good offer of a deal give them 48hrs to consider then confirm we are going if rejected. Do analysis for firms impacted in value chain and ensure they have  increased wkng capital to build stocks as a bulwark and let EU consider the hit to them.
4399 2018-02-24 07:34:16 How is it possible that Micro Systemation’s management $MSAB says that they believe in the company after dumping a huge amount of stocks???? Podcasters, you have to bring this up! @Investeraren @Borspodden
4400 2018-02-24 07:33:25 Let me ask you this: why does any civilian need an AR-15? 100-round mags? Bump-stocks? No civilian needs a high-powered rifle with a high rate of fire, nor do they need the ability to fire 100 rounds without reloading.
4401 2018-02-24 07:33:09 Bigelow Plantation Mint tea is black tea and spearmint so when we're in the US, she stocks up. Here it's almost all peppermint tea.
4402 2018-02-24 07:32:14 Thanks for the info. Our sales team in charge will make sure the Singtel Shop in Bugis will have the stocks. Cheers!
4403 2018-02-24 07:31:15 "Assault rifle" is a term coined in the 90's by gun grabbers to make people think black guns, with adjustable stocks are scarier than ones with wooden stocks. AR15 is not a military grade weapon. It is semi-automatic, not select fire or full auto.
4404 2018-02-24 07:30:48 I have lot of stocks babe
4405 2018-02-24 07:30:10 You havent won SHIT! Trump is still wanting to ban bump stocks, strengthen background checks, raise the age limit to buy a rifle. UNLESS you paid him off which is a federal CRIME in the United States! Mueller will find out though Dont worry!

JUST some that blame NRA members for mass killings

sell their stocks too they will be losing many customers
4408 2018-02-24 07:25:58 there's no credible constitutional argument against banning bump stocks, so why hasn't it been done? even if you disagree with banning them, you must admit most of the public wants it and most of Congress pays lip service to it. who is quietly working against it?
4409 2018-02-24 07:24:42 EXACTLY.  Ban bump stocks. Raise gun buying age. Ban AR-15s. Increase background checks. Close private sale loopholes.
4410 2018-02-24 07:24:34 banning bump stocks has wide public support. it supposedly has wide bipartisan support in Congress. so why wasn't it done? why has the buck been quietly passed to the ATF, which has previously found they lack the authority to ban them?
4411 2018-02-24 07:24:22 Also, did you notice the part at the end where it said the problem is semiautomatic weapons, not bump stocks?
4412 2018-02-24 07:23:55 Bump stocks banned, rapid fire guns banned, high velocity guns like AR-15 banned.
4413 2018-02-24 07:23:41 We did not receive $1,000.00 bonus, I am also paying only $10.00 less tax per paycheck while the corporations buy back their stocks and give bonuses only to executives. This is class warfare directly from the legislative branch. EPIC FAIL!

4417 2018-02-24 07:21:30 Well IMO those choices are certainly better than having your $$ languishing in bonds or bond funds. Personally I like picking my own stocks. I figure I can choose a good company just as well as some fund manager can.
4418 2018-02-24 07:21:09 Please make sure sufficient stocks are available for buyers. Stocks just gone in seconds in first sale. Don't know whether will be successful in second sale. and if it don't..u may loose a valuable customer as Nokia, moto too are about to come with their budget devices
4419 2018-02-24 07:19:16 Checking bitcoin tryna see if them stocks goin up 
4420 2018-02-24 07:17:35 > Raise the age, force states to IMPOSE bg checks on everyone buying a gun, enforce special reasons for buying bump stocks/suppressors.
Just "STOP" condoning ppl that keep screeching "BAN BAN BAN BAN BAN" 24/7 unsupervised
4421 2018-02-24 07:16:02 Just like how a growing number of responsible consumer brands are boycotting the @NRA, Institutional funds should dump gun stocks ASAP. And if they don’t, investors should move their money out. #BoycottNRA
4422 2018-02-24 07:15:32 Even stocks are down, is BTC controlling all?! 
4423 2018-02-24 07:15:30 It’ called “21 Bump Stocks.”
4424 2018-02-24 07:15:13 Please make sure sufficient stocks are available for buyers. Stocks just gone in seconds in first sale. Don't know whether will be successful in second sale.
4425 2018-02-24 07:14:35 Definitely ban bump stocks, but Gun manufacturers don’t care because they’re 3rd party accessories that they don’t make. They could give a shit. Take the bump stocks and definitely move towards uppin the age to buy from 18-21. Then ban high muzzle velocity semi-automatic rifles.
4426 2018-02-24 07:14:22 As to Las Vegas, I'm w/you. Why the hell don't we know what went on there, and why isn't anyone in the media showing the least bit of curiosity? As to bump stocks, do you know they make rifles less accurate and less reliable?
4427 2018-02-24 07:13:24 Like what?

Promoting gun safety
School security
Better background checks
Addressing mental health issues
Regulating bump stocks
Giving away free gun locks
Etc?
4428 2018-02-24 07:13:14 Agree..but like stocks ..Falling in love with so many models or knowing varied principles may increase the aforesaid risk
4429 2018-02-24 07:13:11 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your ADHD
4430 2018-02-24 07:12:00 I see! Do let us run a quick check on this with the relevant teams to see if we can have any arrangements done for you to ensure the stocks in the shop. You're confirmed that the shop you'll be planning to pick it up from is the Singtel Retail Shop at Bugis, yes?
4431 2018-02-24 07:10:13 Yes but from where God gets stocks of Hurs as every killed islamist terrorist have to be given 72 virgins.
4432 2018-02-24 07:09:34 The ban would make it illegal for anyone in Washington to manufacture or sell bump stocks beginning July 1. In July 2019
4433 2018-02-24 07:08:18 Hmmmm. Kylie Jenner admits she doesn't open #Snapchat anymore? Stocks tumble. I never opened it. I never saw the point of Snapchat... Can leveraging #socialmedia #InfluencerMarketing ever be just too risky?

4435 2018-02-24 07:05:27 Watching teenagers defend guns on Snapchat and I feel like I can see the immense struggle going on internally. Just admit it. Guns are killing children. Stop trying to uphold mommy and daddy’s stocks
4436 2018-02-24 07:04:51 I want to invest some more money in some stocks but ima research some companies first.
4437 2018-02-24 07:04:21 it's already illegal to sell alcohol to people under 21 and DUI inspections are already a thing. Guns on other hand are not that hard to get, even in some states there is NO legal age to own a gun, no kidding, no Universal Background checks, bump stocks legal
4438 2018-02-24 07:02:53 Ano,zaklekava na podnikatele, aby z jejich daní financoval větší dotace třeba na linku na toustový chléb pro AB. Zatímco Kalousek měl v rozpočtu podstatně víc peněz do infrastruktury,tedy pro všechny.
4439 2018-02-24 07:02:31 all this talk about Cruz and missed warning signs... I haven't seen any report that Stephen Paddock showed any similar type of warnings. deadliest mass shooting by an individual in US history. and yet, bump stocks still legal. took Parkland before that was even discussed again.

4441 2018-02-24 07:01:26 For all the Companies that @Alyssa_Milano has been posting that are supporters of the NRA, Their stocks are rising. 90% of America HATES Liberal Snowflake Democrats. Think these Liberal Companies are hurting the NRA by pulling their Support and Sponsors? They're Not.
4442 2018-02-24 07:00:34 I’ve got a brokerage account too with stocks a couple ETFs and a mutual fund. I was looking for guidance on whether or not I should reduce my 401k down to the match amount and just invest the difference myself.
4443 2018-02-24 06:59:42 Yes, the cod collapse in the 90s. But fish stocks in  Canada are generally up since the 90s. Trees now cover area in North America, than any time since the early 1900s. New trees convert more CO2 than old growth. But I am sure you knew that
4444 2018-02-24 06:59:10 Second Dotcom bubble burst approaching fast.

4446 2018-02-24 06:57:37 Yes, he’s probably referring to bump stocks.

Oh and by the way your racist is showing.
4447 2018-02-24 06:57:09 Right away! I thought about finances and investing in companies and stocks some where in that field.
4448 2018-02-24 06:56:56 That's why I made my list. So we don't have to rely on our recollection. 
If we pull up from the back of our mind what we know about mass shootings from the media, it's usually something like: "white supremacists shoot up schools with AR-15s because the NRA won't ban bump stocks"

4451 2018-02-24 06:53:59 And the funny thing is, that Trump actually supports things like raising age limits, enforcing background checks, and banning bump stocks. That’s what I support and others calling for gun regulation even though I don’t speak for all.
4452 2018-02-24 06:52:35 170 million Americans own stocks...
4453 2018-02-24 06:52:32 Bump stocks seems reasonable but it’s just a step closer toward the marched goal for the embolden democrats.
4454 2018-02-24 06:51:00 In no rational world is trump a solution, unless you mean 'final solution'. Trump's up for race war. It is the@GOP culture of death. Obama did not approve bump stocks.
4455 2018-02-24 06:50:52 I don't know that they are opposing it and I've seen no legislation put forward about bump stocks, only a request to investigate. As for trigger cranks, this is unrealistic to use in a shooting, you have to be in sniper position to use it and I don't think they should be legal
4456 2018-02-24 06:50:31 Here’s a thought- why don’t we take every measure possible to limit the amount of damage that could be done in 3-5 min- you know- like limiting magazine  capacity, banning bump stocks, banning semi-automatic weapons...
4457 2018-02-24 06:48:58 Buy and Packers & movers stocks...
4458 2018-02-24 06:47:56 1 of 2
Reasonable gun reform:
 Ban assault weapons, bumper stocks, large clips, large ammo buys
 Background checks
 No one with history of violence, especially domestic violence, can buy/own
 One week or more waiting period
 Create national gun registry…
4459 2018-02-24 06:47:18 Yes..totally agree...but thats the feedback I got from my broker last week..hunting for a commercial place.. people consider real estate safe..stocks as risky..requires effort..as compared to that real estate is easy by default prices rise..

4461 2018-02-24 06:45:04 I happen to like dealing with Schwab, have had my IRA with them since I was in my 20s. I’m a firm believer in picking individual stocks (or an ETF or 2) all by yourself. No need to pay some advisor a bunch of $$. Just start out with a few good companies & add from there. UNH,JPM
4462 2018-02-24 06:43:39 Do you think that licensing guns in a similar manner to cars, or banning accessories like bump stocks, is a violation of your rights?

4464 2018-02-24 06:39:27 Our export earnings have stagnated. The bankers are mixing up their stocks and flows.

4466 2018-02-24 06:37:55 I'd prefer to not have to use a bolt action myself for that purpose. So let's make high capacity magazines illegal (hordes of animals are not an issue!), outlaw bump stocks, require regular recertification/training, and no ownership for convicted domestic assaulters.
4467 2018-02-24 06:36:46 Chápu že nejste zvyklí na premiéra, který je aktivní v EU a je jazykově vybaven a chce pro ČR vyjednat lepší čerpání peněz z EU fondů. Myslím, že můžete být dobrým členem týmu TOP09 Kalousek nám ukázal, jak se daní hazard, jak fantasticky vybíral daně, jak porcoval státní  rozp.

4470 2018-02-24 06:35:39 Gun safety?  Like bump stocks?  Gun safety like better background checks?  Gun safety? Like keeping ex-convicts from owning guns?  Gun safety like mental health screening?  The NRAs idea of gun safety is that if everyone had a gun everyone would be safe.
4471 2018-02-24 06:35:23 Yes, the billionaire economics major from Wharton with a long history of successful business and stock investments doesn't understand stocks.
4472 2018-02-24 06:34:10 Nagpost kasi nung isang araw si Kylie na  sya lang ba daw ang di na nagbubukas ng snapchat masyado... at coincidence, bumagsak yung stocks ng snapchat... may kinalaman daw kaya yung tweet ni kylie dun :)
4473 2018-02-24 06:31:03 Now I’m not saying I WANT that or that it would even necessarily be a good policy but it’s something to consider that would, if nothing else, make more sense than restricting pistol grips or telescoping stocks
4474 2018-02-24 06:30:20 Never got one. Staying on rent. Invested in stocks

4479 2018-02-24 06:23:05 And the NRA came out in support of banning bump stocks so this guy can’t even get his talking points straight. But, once again they are offering up the minimum to save face- bc they have to- and who knows if they’ll even do it.
4480 2018-02-24 06:21:12 Gun application should include criminal check and credit check!
No felons, no domestic abusers No semi automatic weapons , bump stocks or large capacity magazines
4481 2018-02-24 06:20:34 Don't you dare infringe on the rights of the American people, bump fire stocks aren't a problem and raising the age to 21 is unconstitutional
4482 2018-02-24 06:20:17 Stocks are down another 1%!
4483 2018-02-24 06:16:54 I own 5 guns, including shotguns. Ban AR15. Ban bump stocks. Background checks. Ban 3D printing of guns, too. (Same as printing counterfeit money). I'll keep may guns.
4484 2018-02-24 06:16:12 The point of the 2nd ammendment is to have equal firepower to protect us from a government takeover. Bump stocks have been around for a decade or so and the people speaking out against them are just now finding out the even exist.
4485 2018-02-24 06:15:44 Monique is not funny PBP she had her window , got her coins , now her window is closed ! RETIRE AUBTIE GET INTO STOCKS OR SOMETHING
4486 2018-02-24 06:15:12 Instead of banning some, having others pop up, etc., how about we call out limits for ALL: x rounds in y seconds (we need a reasonable rate, nothing like you can get iwth bump stocks, and triggers that fire on pull and release, etc.), and 15 rounds capacity (no 50 round mags).
4487 2018-02-24 06:15:10 In addition, in almost all cases of Americas mass shootings, the guns were obtained legally and those that were illegal had the potential to be made legal through bump stocks. I understand your concern but the fear is irrational and has no evidence to back it up.
4488 2018-02-24 06:14:24 Can you please share the 5 stocks selected by you- would like to benefit
4489 2018-02-24 06:12:42 the great thing about options on ETFs is that they're usually cheaper than options on the top 10 stocks.
4490 2018-02-24 06:11:56 Bump Stock loophole. NRA opposes a ban on bump stocks.

4501 2018-02-24 06:04:28 No, they actually don't. Bump stocks are what real gun enthusiasts call "tacticool" flashy but ultimately don't improve the performance of the gun.  In reality they are useless and are used by the same people that have multiple tac lights mounted.
4502 2018-02-24 06:02:40 Assault weapons need to be banned, so do bump stocks, and loopholes at gun shows, and so much more, but it doesn't change the fact that #BrowardCountyDeputies dropped the ball, over 18 times!!! This is on them- they were the 1st line of defense, and failed
4503 2018-02-24 06:02:22 He used a bump stock. You know who wanted to ban bump stocks before Vegas? The NRA. True story. Google it. @ResistNW @e2pilot
4504 2018-02-24 06:02:15 The LV one is really peculiar and one where lack of bump stocks probably would have helped but other than that I don’t know

4512 2018-02-24 05:58:37 I think most people have the same thoughts.  The problem is every time something like this happens the NRA makes Americans think the feds are coming to search your house and seize your guns. Wonder how many AR-15’s and bump stocks are now on back order?
4513 2018-02-24 05:57:31 Would love to hear @realDonaldTrump say something about all these companies abandoning the #NRA, then watch their stocks drop!

4515 2018-02-24 05:56:27 Amazing.  If I can just correlate the movement of the chain to changes in the valuations of publicly traded stocks.
4516 2018-02-24 05:56:05 No, but what would have? Aside from bump stocks in the case of Vegas.

4521 2018-02-24 05:50:56 I don’t usually have an interest or get involved with politics and the law and whatnot... I agree with 2 things so far: ban bump stocks because who needs those really. And make it a national requirement for ALL states to report ALL civilians records, criminal or not, to NICS.
4522 2018-02-24 05:50:41 The @NRA has been undercutting law enforcement for decades. Blocking background checks, data collection, keeping the gun show loophole open, access to bump stocks, shorter wait times, rolling back any restrictions for access... the results are more dead children. #Deplorable

4524 2018-02-24 05:50:32 Bump stocks ain't the pro broblem, idiot
4525 2018-02-24 05:47:32 NO Bump Stocks, No large magazines, close all loopholes, No sales of guns without full background checks which includes private sales & gun shows. All sales need 2 be reported 2 the national data base. NO Fly list No buy list, No weapons if you & an abuser, criminal of any kind.
4526 2018-02-24 05:47:26 I remember one time in history we had a competition to fake invest in stocks and I only invested in things that had my name in it. I got 4th. #dontknowhowyalldothat9to5

4543 2018-02-24 05:37:19 I am pro gun and I do not understand pro gun people that are against banning bump stocks. Like what the heck do you need it for??
4544 2018-02-24 05:36:53 You are slow, aren’t you? Unfettered isn’t a state in a dualism. It’s relative. As Burger and many ppl have said, the NRA has opposed anything that challenges unfettered access. Bump stocks, silencers, open carry, etc, etc.

4548 2018-02-24 05:35:25 Who does regulate the distribution & sale of bump stocks then?  Somebody either regulates or should regulate firearm parts.  Revise regulation if needed. Get on with it!

4550 2018-02-24 05:33:14 No civilian has a need for bump stocks, assault rifles or armour piercing bullets. The NRA only resists banning these things for the money. As a native Brit in the immigration process of living in the US, I can tell you it’s possible to have a society that doesn’t need many guns.

4553 2018-02-24 05:32:07 Just heard someone on CNN say banning bump-stocks and raising the age to purchase an AR style rifle to 21 are good “first steps.” First steps towards WHAT exactly.  America’s issue is really multifaceted and ALL players need to be part of the solution.
4554 2018-02-24 05:32:03 if this was an us or them issue with Trump, why did he suggest raising age to 21, banning bump stocks, and mandatory background checks?
4555 2018-02-24 05:30:30 If we are insisting a ban on semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks, why all the fuss from the right? You still have all your other stupid guns and the 2nd Amendment intact. To be this stubborn is SELFISH! Don't dare say you care about the kids! #ShameOnYou!
4556 2018-02-24 05:29:54 Unfortunately I have too. There is a way to reduce school shootings and overall gun violence in the US..but you have to have the courage to repeal 2A..banning bump stocks isn't going to cut it
4557 2018-02-24 05:29:32 I agree. :)

4559 2018-02-24 05:29:09 And let's not get bogged down by gun nuts like Rubio talking about plastic vs wooden stocks!
4560 2018-02-24 05:27:57 I understand physics (and guns).

Tallying foot-pounds per minute shows pretty clearly the giant gap between run of the mill handguns / bolt action rifles and tactical rifles with box mags / drums.

If looking for a way to draw a line, no need to look at grips/stocks/models.
4561 2018-02-24 05:27:39 Jay, its ok TO forget your socks. But  as a hunter, former state & fed prosecutor, & mom to a HS student and HS teacher, I know that no one outside of law enforcement/military should be able to legally possess automatic firearms/bump stocks. Enough AR-15s & blood in our schools.
4562 2018-02-24 05:27:31 FYI, I do support the 2nd Amendment. I live in a rural area with wild animals, and also very limited police (2 in the region). I don't support the @NRA. No civilian needs anything like an AR-15, or bump-stocks, or 100-round mags. #BanAssaultWeaponsAndAccessories!!!
4563 2018-02-24 05:27:06 The NRA hide their selfishness behind the guise of patriotism and freedom. Too many parents have seen their children sacrificed in the name of the 2nd. Time for the NRA to make a small sacrifice in return by agreeing to end the sale of assault-type rifles and bump stocks.
4564 2018-02-24 05:26:50 I'll be with the youth in this country. You can bet, I'm going to enjoy marching with them! I'm on the right side....errrr left of this issue..it's not all guns, it's a ban on semi-automatic & bump stocks & better background checks & more. I don't think that's too much to expect.
4565 2018-02-24 05:26:13 Kids are self taught in many of these topics. There’s an app game where they trade stocks for “real”.
4566 2018-02-24 05:25:50 *Buffet fanboys
4567 2018-02-24 05:25:31 Even more solutions the #NRA suggests before reasonable background checks:

~ Boxes filled with rabid woodchucks in schools, which, when released, eat the wooden stocks of guns
~ Develop some sort of mutant metalchuck to eat other gun parts
~ Those knife/ball things from Phantasm
4568 2018-02-24 05:25:11 Universal background checks, including for private sales. Reinstate the assault weapons ban. Require domestic abusers to surrender firearms if they've been found guilty of domestic assault or have a restraining order against them. Ban bump stocks. ...Those are just a few examples

4570 2018-02-24 05:23:54 He was going for bump stocks anyway
4571 2018-02-24 05:23:35 I’m so sure you just came up with this. We had 2 girls commit suicide in the local HS thru other means & trying to figure out if their stocks included rope companies was the last thing the 15-17 year olds were doing here. Looking at mental health issues became a larger focus.
4572 2018-02-24 05:23:22 I agree (though folding stocks make them more concealable), but the point is you can't band-aid firearm violence by nitpicking specific features. It's the firearms themselves which are the problem.
4573 2018-02-24 05:23:17 Not that hard to change stocks on either of them - a competent gun enthusiast can completely swap appearances between the two rifles in about 15 minutes.
4574 2018-02-24 05:21:52 @realddonaldTrump says the 9 yrs of economic growth & rise of stocks, 4yrs of no deaths in the US airline industry, etc was all him.

4575 2018-02-24 05:20:18 Almost ALL of these are “stocks”. The SEC is telegraphing it. They ain’t gonna be nice.Let’s put it that way. Fines and shutterrings will litter crypto in time. Question is-do they do it in peicemeal or all at once like poker stars? Is a huge risk.Ain’t going on like this forever

4578 2018-02-24 05:15:59 Point is that an AR 15 is practically identical to an M16.  Auto and burst mode are not terribly useful except when firing at a crowd.  Bump stocks should be illegal.  Semiautomatic weapons also.  Good hunters can get by fine with a bolt action.
4579 2018-02-24 05:15:19 The NRA is on record and the police did agree they are on racord wanting to ban bump stocks for 20+ years now. Made for military use found to be deficient and re-made to suit hunting. The uppers change to shoot small game to big game but do not have the means for military use.

4590 2018-02-24 05:03:17 And he's successfully shifted the narrative from:
- banning assault weapons & bump stocks/high round mags
- universal background checks
- age restrictions 

To- we're giving big contracts to gun manufacturers, so how can the public pay for it?

4592 2018-02-24 05:02:08 Watching the news earlier and there was a story about one of those Jenner kids bailing on Snapchat and how it caused a 6% drop in the value of the company’s stocks. Sadly, I didn’t know what Snapchat was, so I had to google it
4593 2018-02-24 05:01:04 Throughout this whole gun debate, I find myself utterly ignorant on guns, the ar-15 specifically. Bump stocks, too. Also, the current laws in place. It’d be nice if the news spent more time educating than creating divisive settings. I’ll take responsibility, too. Maybe we all can
4594 2018-02-24 05:00:53 Whether you like it or not- changes Democrats have been pushing for YEARS like stricter background checks, higher age requirements, banning bump stocks etc are ALL things the GOP/Trump are talking about now & calling for. Sadly, it took the victims of this shooting demanding it.

4598 2018-02-24 04:56:24 Wow. Sell those stocks noe
4599 2018-02-24 04:56:20 Why is it that when we have a tragedy we take away more of our rights? How does that make sense to anyone? Liberty and freedom is the answer NOT restrictions on bump stocks!

4603 2018-02-24 04:53:08 There’s even one additional problem currently. And that is the fact that treasuries and stocks have been moving together since QE. Treasuries or bonds are no longer good diversifiers. All you’re left to do is either trade actively or use options to hedge risks.

4606 2018-02-24 04:52:41 @grahamlee
 Military know the killing capacity of assault rifles and extended clips are weapons designed for spraying bullets like a water hose. A semi-auto can be modified to fully automatic easily.
Then there's also bump stocks if you don't modify.
4607 2018-02-24 04:52:21 Tucker sweetie you forgot Eliminate guns, repeal the 2nd Amendment, Interpret the 2nd Amendment the way it is supposed to be interpreted, eliminate Bump stocks, eliminate AR-15s..........
4608 2018-02-24 04:51:54 @SpeakerRyan & Mitch McConnell have sat on bills & legislation for MONTHS! Such as ban on Bump Stocks, expanding BC & ban on assault rifles. Ryan has REFUSED to DO ANYTHING to move them through the process. His excuse is "now is not the time", while kids die!!

#VoteRyanOut2018
4609 2018-02-24 04:51:47 What does a civilian need an AR-15 for? How about bump-stocks? 100-round magazines? Try justifying those in civilian hands, please.
4610 2018-02-24 04:51:35 Fire up your 3-D Printers for the Bump Stocks, for starters!
4611 2018-02-24 04:51:34 Thank you for compiling a list of companies I intend to start shorting their stocks Monday morning @BestWestern, @WyndhamHotels, @Alamo, @nationalcares, @Enterprise & @FNBOmaha
4612 2018-02-24 04:50:09 AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles, such as the M-16, but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing ONLY ONE ROUND W/ EACH PULL OF THE TRIGGER.

That's why bump stocks where banned, since it turned single shot to semi-auto. Not Machine Guns
4613 2018-02-24 04:50:07 I'd say most people who think things like bump stocks or AR15s are somehow more deadly than other weapons don't know or understand all that much about guns to begin with. A skilled shooter with a bolt action can be more deadly than an idiot with a machine pistol.
4614 2018-02-24 04:50:04 Not to mention enough money for a vanity military parade for president Gun Stocks
4615 2018-02-24 04:49:47 Enjoy them while you can. The semi automatics & bump stocks that make them fully automatic need to go. You can have every single other legal kind you want. These were intended to be used by the military for military purposes only. If this upsets you, buy a bayonet & reenact 1776.
4616 2018-02-24 04:49:36 Wow! @POTUS has proposed gun reform, ban bump stocks, and is working with govenors next week (38 attending) on school security aznd share ideas from the "round table" session. And that's still not enough for you people. Well, God bless and #MAGA

4618 2018-02-24 04:46:48 There are many suggestions of laws (examples, not endorsing) add prohibited categories to background checks. Mandatory reporting to NICS. Mental health check to get a gun. Or just don't allow guns than can kill 30 people in 10 seconds. Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks
4619 2018-02-24 04:46:13 Continued hypocrisy from the Liberals... exposed AGAIN. Can't wait to see their stocks tumble with this latest attack on the NRA.
4620 2018-02-24 04:45:31 I believe strongly in the second Amendment.. I am a Constitutional scholar but I DO NOT believe that any citizen has the right to purchase assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks..
4621 2018-02-24 04:45:11 Can't find it - the gist is that calibre HAS NOTHING to do in this debate. It has everything to do with rate of fire, magazine capacity, and mods like bump stocks.Hard to bump a bolt action rifle or lever rifle. Yet I can get those both chambered in the same calibre.
It's THE GUN
4622 2018-02-24 04:44:49 An interesting fact! Equity Mf’s hv invested ₹2.63 trillion in 10 stocks which include HDFC bank, icici  bank, L&T, SBI, infy and Kotak Bank
4623 2018-02-24 04:44:43 This is wrong! The nra promotes gun safety! They for example suggested to regulators eliminating bump stocks long before Las Vegas. They aren’t promoting deadly attacks. They want to end them. This is just wrong.
4624 2018-02-24 04:44:29 Far more effective than banning bump stocks.

4627 2018-02-24 04:43:56 As @Emma4Change says WE CALL BS! Mr. Hammer no one is trying to take away 2nd amendment rights. You still have the right to own a gun even if bump stocks are banned. You still have the right to own a gun even if the age is raised to 21! So stop the fear mongoring!

4631 2018-02-24 04:43:17 I seriously do not understand why bump stocks are legal. Why they were EVER LEGAL.

It's possible to mechanically transform some semiautomatics into fully automatic weapons. But it's illegal! Your gun becomes an illegal gun!
4632 2018-02-24 04:42:52 You need to support laws with a max rate of fire and ban on all rate increasing devices not just bump stocks.  Or just ban semi-auto - far simpler and fewer loopholes that way.  Do you want to keep us safe?
4633 2018-02-24 04:42:41 Ohhhhh yes thank you for your google facts. You’re the same kind of person who will cry about bump stocks and fight for those to stay around too I can assume.
4634 2018-02-24 04:42:28 See,  and this is the problem,  he didn't modify the firearm,  he modified the stock.  And for the record,  bump stocks are a way to get around the NFA, and yes,  should be illegal.
4635 2018-02-24 04:42:09 What does bump stocks and the age have to do with anything???
4636 2018-02-24 04:42:04 What does cdc stand for. It belongs 8n dhs or dhhs. Its a mute point. Stop blaming gop for the @fbi & law enforcement dropping the ball. They've been incompetant in 8 mass shootings. Blame them for not doing their job. And blame Obama for legalizing bump stocks.
4637 2018-02-24 04:40:59 JAR - no assault rifles with bump-stocks and any other semi-automatic rifles....good deal. Now, can't take away the second amendment rights. JoyAnn probably doesn't understand all this but she will.

4639 2018-02-24 04:40:09 Yes. I’ve been looking at this website called Goodbye Gun Stocks and trying to decide which one I go with @Vanguard_Group is bad and @TIAA is pretty bad too. @Fidelity has some gun free options. Please advice. It’s a lot of my money per pay check!
4640 2018-02-24 04:37:57 Don't believe those are bump stocks.
4641 2018-02-24 04:37:55 And they say they don't want to take our guns - BS!!  How about enforcing existing laws and enhancing background checks instead? Ban bump stocks.  Regarding AR-15's, anyone who has shot one knows it's much more accurate and easier to control than a pistol for home defense.
4642 2018-02-24 04:37:24 There are many ways to get paid. The PDB which they are both privy to, is like a magic looking glass with perhaps useful insider information that may have value in the private sector. Events that may impact business & effect stocks for example.
4643 2018-02-24 04:37:19 Trump just signed the bill banking bump stocks today.  Made sessions start on it in December.  Until someone writes a bill, not much he can do just yet.
4644 2018-02-24 04:36:10 Trump is all over the map, and can you imagine what a teacher would endure if they shot the wrong kids?? Do like other nations and ban ARs, bump stocks, 10 round Max clips. Trump reversed Obama on mental health and silencers, now he is for it, bipolar dude
4645 2018-02-24 04:35:57 but is this a staple for them to eat? is it like cows/chickens here? I don't want to take food from a country where they live so close to those that are starving-NK-but I don't like the idea of eating dog-but has anyone noticed the south korean food stocks/staples?
4646 2018-02-24 04:35:55 I support banning them both or at the very least ban modifications such as the pistol grip (makes weapon much easier to handle), bump stocks, silencers, etc., and limit clip sizes to 6 or less. No online sales,no private sales. 1/3
4647 2018-02-24 04:35:11 Hey, Sean.  Do you want any additional restrictions on guns, eg, background checks, bump stocks, or anything else?  Just wondering
4648 2018-02-24 04:34:45 Biathletes should pack AR 15s with 50 round clips and bump fire stocks. Who’s with me? #Olympics2018
4649 2018-02-24 04:34:40 YES! Please ban bump stocks, Assault Rifles, large capacity ammunition clips and fully automatic weapons for civilians. I dont need 40+ bullets per minute to hunt, protect or defend.
4650 2018-02-24 04:34:11 Trying lol I got Twon into stocks and that’s all we talk about damn near, other than sports.
4651 2018-02-24 04:33:27 Is @TIAA investing in gun stocks? According to #GoodbyeGunStocks it is and that is a problem for me. Can I get an update? Trying to move my funds around. @NewtownAction @sandyhook @NeverAgainMSD @drainthenra
4652 2018-02-24 04:32:48 They are civilian versions of the military M14-M16 (assault weapons)& can kill a lot of people in a short anount of time. You are splitting hairs, just like with the 2nd amendment. Bump stocks are legal that can turn any rifle into a machine gun, which you claim are illegal.
4653 2018-02-24 04:32:30 Thanks for everything @Snapchat. As far as I’m concerned, you haven’t responded to anyone’s complaints, and your stocks are dropping. Give us our fucking Snapchat back!
4654 2018-02-24 04:32:24 His rod & staff is his word and in bible days was physical used to protect the sheep from other animals. It's a far stretch to a gun against other people. There are people trained for that already & teaching is a whole different profession. Just ban semiautomatic and bump stocks.
4655 2018-02-24 04:32:02 FOR SALE! Limited stocks

Wine and liquors. Cheaper compare to mall price. With seal. PM me for the price.
4656 2018-02-24 04:29:46 Start banning guns. Start with bump stocks and AR15s. Then just keep moving. Hit the NRA where it hurts. @Google @amazon could stop talking NRA money and promoting NRATV. Stop being so defeatist.
4657 2018-02-24 04:29:44 I need to know if @Fidelity is investing in gun stocks? I am trying to make sure my money is not being used to fund the @NRA or gun manufacturers. #BoycottNRA @NeverAgainMSD @NewtownAction @sandyhook
4658 2018-02-24 04:29:36 Consider bump stocks, as was raised after the Vegas shooting. One can actually very easily bump fire any semi-automatic weapon without such. But no one declaring bumpstocks the devil seems to know this.

4660 2018-02-24 04:29:23 Bump stocks should be banned. I do agree with that
4661 2018-02-24 04:29:02 Barack Obama's BATF approved the bump stock for sale. The NRA is perfectly happy to ban bump stocks. When the bump stock ban was written up, the bill didn't say "Bump Stock" it was written in ambiguous Schumerese. Banning bump stocks doesn't bother anyone. Ban them explicitly.
4662 2018-02-24 04:28:16 How to solve mass shootings

-Arm administrators
-Arm willing teachers
-Ending HIPPA for background checks
-Teaching of God and our morals to counter a desensitized society
-End gunshow loophole for private dealers 
-Banning I’d bump stocks

All done and the second is protected.
4663 2018-02-24 04:27:51 Sell Avis and Enterprises’ stocks as well btw
4664 2018-02-24 04:27:41 Obama signed for the sale of bump stocks
4665 2018-02-24 04:26:01 An Assault Rifle is a rapid fire weapon, with bump stocks existing they can make a typical AR-15's possible fire rate increase dramatically. With magazines upwards of 20 rounds being available for purchase, this can be a large amount of fire power for a shooter to be able to use.
4666 2018-02-24 04:25:37 They explained it extensively during the period after the Vegas shooting.  That's why we all now know about bump stocks.  Pistols: smaller magazines; smaller caliber; inaccurate when fired rapidly.  Hunting rifles: only four or five rounds.

4670 2018-02-24 04:24:49 You may very well have the right position on bump stocks and background checks,let's see
4671 2018-02-24 04:24:21 @tomwfranck curious re: avoiding sin stocks. there's no harm to the actual company (ex. secondary offerings) - why reward new ss investors with better earnings yield?

4677 2018-02-24 04:20:53 Nope—out of 158 mass shooters in US 21 of them under 21. Couple that with fact there are 400k gun thefts a year & this doesn’t mean ! #BanAssaultRifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks & silencers & then we can say “good” Gov. Scott. No now. #NeverAgain @AMarch4OurLives
4678 2018-02-24 04:20:27 I have no problem with this discussing guns there's a lot of areas that can be changed there's red flag laws the bump stocks but not making semi-automatic weapons illegal, from legal license caring owners.I would only want my grandchildren to go to a school that is not-gun free.
4679 2018-02-24 04:20:22 @nra 
Sounds like a good time to dump stocks. 
Hertz, TrueCar, Avis, Budget, LifeLock, FedEx, Norton, Alamo, Enterprise, National Car Rental, First National Bank, Wyndham Worldwide, parent company of Ramada, Days Inn, Super 8 & other nationwide hotel firms, MetLife and Symantec.
4680 2018-02-24 04:20:14 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Ban high capacity magazines
3. Ban armor-piercing bullets
4. Ban personal ownership of assault weapons but allow use in gun ranges
5. Require registration of ALL guns
6. Require 3 day waiting period for purchase
7. Fix background check system

4684 2018-02-24 04:18:15 Yes!  THIS!  And responsible gun owners, who aren't in it for the "badass toys" of it, undertand this.  They may miss their 30 round magazines, but that's okay, they get it.  Let's limit firearms by how fast they shoot (this way it's not about bump stocks or triggers that...
4685 2018-02-24 04:17:54 You're service sucks ass anyways. You ban an organization for what? It is not moral to blame people for bad actions that had NOTHING to do with it. See your stocks go byebye #guncontrol

4689 2018-02-24 04:16:03 I agree with you and with this child. #NRA is a terrorist and all those who keep spreading lies and spreading terror into the minds of  American citizens telling them we want to take their guns away. We only want All Assault Weapons banned along with Bump Stocks and related items
4690 2018-02-24 04:15:43 Bump stocks and any accessories similar too them, all gone. Stop the sale and manufacturing of them, stop selling any parts to fix them, whatever.
4691 2018-02-24 04:15:29 my mama's a lil hipster african woman. she does yoga and stocks up on kombucha. currently profiting from the latter

4693 2018-02-24 04:14:58 Sure, get rid of bump stocks. No argument against that. Obama administration shouldn't have approved them for sale in my opinion. Trump has already called for them to be banned. So, has the NRA.
4694 2018-02-24 04:13:12 Your right is not to bump stocks. Lay off children’s lives. Also the shooter was not on anti depressants so what are you referring to?
4695 2018-02-24 04:12:28 (Also, while it's a more reasonable mistake, the AR is for ArmaLite rather than assault rifle, same as bolt-action guns like the AR-5.  "Modern sporting rifle" is NSSF marketing speak over assault weapons or plastic stocks in general, not assault rifles.)
4696 2018-02-24 04:12:22 .@ATFHQ hello you folks who work hard to keep us safe, if it is illegal to modify a firearm in order to convert it to a fully automatic firearm (“machine gun”) why are bump stocks legal? They increase to rate of fire to about 500 rounds per minute. Help me understand. Thank you!
4697 2018-02-24 04:11:48 And with bump stocks they fire xxx times per second.
4698 2018-02-24 04:11:06 I reallyyyy think this will hurt these companies  more than #NRA. Plus I guess some don't realize the local authorities, along with the @POTUS are working to change the laws, like age & bump stocks, remember it's true "guns don't kill, people do", just saying
4699 2018-02-24 04:10:50 Good! Thx @hertz. I just bought more stocks
4700 2018-02-24 04:10:45 Stocks in Kleenex?
4701 2018-02-24 04:10:24 Which means that 67 and 14’s stocks are going up. Today was a good day for Habs fans, even if they don’t realize it yet
4702 2018-02-24 04:10:08 Don't forget H.4424, also bipartisan, to ban bump stocks.  @leonstav
4703 2018-02-24 04:10:07 @mchang1 @HaggyAlerts hahaha he's good at stocks. We're joking on discord
4704 2018-02-24 04:08:13 The NRA does not Ban Anything, the government is the one to ban things. That's why people were shocked to learn it was the obama ATF That approved the sale of bump stocks..wow!
4705 2018-02-24 04:08:11 We were talking about stocks
4706 2018-02-24 04:07:27 You may never know they might release until complete.stocks of devices get sold wait for Android p to get released. Who cares abt customer
4707 2018-02-24 04:07:03 Which needs to be changed. And get rid of bump stocks.
4708 2018-02-24 04:06:11 I heard on Bloomberg that gun stocks took a hit on wallstreet today.
4709 2018-02-24 04:06:07 @bigballerbrand stocks going 
4710 2018-02-24 04:05:52 Ed,

AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles, such as the M-16, but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing ONLY ONE ROUND W/ EACH PULL OF THE TRIGGER.

That's why bump stocks where banned, since it turned single shot to semi-auto. 

DUH!!!
4711 2018-02-24 04:05:20 In 1 1/2 weeks I will be on a plane for the first time on my way to NYC for a conference and I’m not prepared for New York weather

4714 2018-02-24 04:04:53 Which big mutual fund companies hold gun stocks in their funds that are invested in by teachers,  hospitals, emergency workers, students,  colleges ...?
4715 2018-02-24 04:04:33 Bump stocks are just a part...a stock. It is not a weapon. Do you even know what they are?
4716 2018-02-24 04:04:20 Yeah, I know his stock was already on a downward trend, but his Trump worship and anti-Clinton histrionics sent it to the penny stocks. That's a good thing.

that goes a little something like this

i always tried to be the flyest kid in the block

so thats when i had this bright idea
throw the party of the month
no, the party of the year

all the fine +
4718 2018-02-24 04:03:10 I'm actually screaming about the people saying that Trump lost their support because of his desire to strengthen background checks for firearms and ban bump stocks BUT NOT BECAUSE OF HIS DEGRADING OF WOMEN, PEOPLE OF COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, ETC 
4719 2018-02-24 04:03:01 How about a list of all the pension and asset management companies that invest in gun co stocks? Teachers,  emergency workers, hospitals... all investing!
4720 2018-02-24 04:02:50 The FBI crime data does not support any legislation on either AR style rifles or bump stocks. Unfortunately background checks don't predict the future.

4725 2018-02-24 04:00:50 But this way he can keep those stocks high
4726 2018-02-24 03:59:35 Heavily restrict drum mags
Ban bump stocks and trigger cranks
Loosen regs on silencers (compromise right?)
Require private sales to take place at an FFL
Actually enforce straw purchasing laws
4727 2018-02-24 03:59:19 To all you young people out there protesting and marching and walking out, keep it up. It’s working. Companies are cutting ties with the NRA. Florida is banning rifle sales under 21. The fucking PRESIDENT wants to ban bump stocks. #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
4728 2018-02-24 03:58:49 I’m all for guns, own multiple AR-15s, handguns and shotguns and I see bump stocks pointless in my opinion.
4729 2018-02-24 03:58:24 I think both parties have some racists and fascists within them. I DEFINITELY do not see the Dems as not racist, pro women, pro gun regulation and pro environment. Ex. are how they treated Nina, how HRC treats women in general, how bump stocks were approved under Obama, 1/2
4730 2018-02-24 03:58:00 Because those 200 do not influence every day policy the way NRA money does.  No one wants your guns.  All people want is responsible wait times, background checks, and rules on semi-automatics and bump stocks.  Every real gun owner I know agrees
4731 2018-02-24 03:57:47 Waley friend kay late na kaayo ko. Nagparabolic na sya. Medyo di pa ko kamao man gud basta speculative stocks. So nahadlok ko mosud. Sayang lagi kaayo. Nice entry point ato kay naa sa mga 3-5pesos. Kasakay ka?
4732 2018-02-24 03:57:23 Luckily it’s not up to anyone else to determine how many I can have and it never will be. You don’t need semi-auto? My 9mm is a semi-auto. A single shot rifle won’t do for personal protection. I 100% agree about bump stocks though and I think they’ll be banned soon enough.
4733 2018-02-24 03:56:09 Again,didn't think so.....maybe if I change the subject,I doubt it,but here goes...it appears Trump now supports "tougher " background checks and a ban on bump stocks,do you agree?
4734 2018-02-24 03:53:31 Bump stocks are a modification that even the Obama administration approved since it still requires a trigger pull for each shot fired. The gun is still a semi automatic.  It's not right that one insane, suicidal Las Vegas sniper is able to dictate law to the entire country..
4735 2018-02-24 03:53:12 They need bump stocks for target practice? The NRA takes its members for idiots. And, maybe they’re correct.
4736 2018-02-24 03:52:52 This looks good but quick question. Has Dartmouth endowment divested itself of stocks in armaments manufacturers? Thanks!
4737 2018-02-24 03:52:39 The Robinhood brokerage is brilliant. Zero commission cost on U.S. stocks, Bitcoin etc. Now the small investor can get involved with stocks in small quantities. There is literally zero excuse for people to not start putting some money into the markets.

4747 2018-02-24 03:44:03 Dear brain damaged gun worshippers w/ their heads planted firmly up their asses. The 2nd Amendment calls for "A well regulated militia". A militia is civilians w/ guns. WELL REGULATED. Fix/improve background checks. Track/restrict high capacity magazine sales. Ban bump stocks.
4748 2018-02-24 03:43:35 Oh, yes, tweets are an accurate measurement of policy proposals. 

As I've said, the only actual attempt made so far is bump stocks, which as I also said, is a half-measure.
4749 2018-02-24 03:42:55 Trump you are such a twit. Why are you no longer talking about banning the bump stocks. Well let’s not play games we know it’s the NHRA,  sorry NRA they own you and many other politicians. Very well-known. Extremely sad. Wish you cared about United States!!!
4750 2018-02-24 03:41:47 Stupid Mistake! Now That's a good way to lower stocks in your companies, buy when it drops to new lows, & gain when it gets a do-over :)

- Did not get AR ban in Florida

- Increased cost of ARs
- Help sell tens of thousands more ARs and bump stocks

Sounds like they are doing NRA work.

So the NRA, who command Republican legislators more effectively than any other special interest wants bump stocks banned and controlling all 3 branches of the Federal government haven't moved this legislative priority an inch in four months? Or did they say that because it was
4762 2018-02-24 03:36:26 I would like to see more tweets like these that condemn all gun ownership, not just the minutia of AR-15s and bump stocks.
4763 2018-02-24 03:33:43 Better sell their stocks. They will lose profits. #MAGA @MetLife @enterprisecares
4764 2018-02-24 03:33:34 Two ex-Googlers have a replacement for your local swimming pool: a desktop cylinder that only stocks one product per day.
4765 2018-02-24 03:33:33 Unless we secure our southern border, new gun control laws are useless.  Bump stocks, magazines, semi-automatic weapons, etc will flow into the US just like illegal drugs.
4766 2018-02-24 03:33:20 People should be of legal age to purchase any firearms!. Stronger background checks, Bump Stocks outlawed, mental health. All military style guns should not be allowed except for the military. Why does any one need a military style weapon to defend their home?

4769 2018-02-24 03:32:17 I’m a fan of all the Native American logos. In respect to them who respected the land they lived on. And used the resources only nature could provide. And now it’s a golf course. Ironic, I know!?!? “It’s evolution” “buying stocks on the day of the crash!” PJ
4770 2018-02-24 03:32:06 NRA has called for the ATF to regulate bump stocks. There shouldn't be a ban on ARs. As for mental health, you can't really ensure that prior unless there's a specific issue that would bar sale. I'm open to the age increase, and I think we need to look at TGRO's
4771 2018-02-24 03:31:43 Don't get rid of the AR15"S Tha NRA will never put up with it, We'll get rid of bump stocks NRA dosen't sell them
4772 2018-02-24 03:31:39 NRA packages public policy options to distract from the core issue.

NRA blames “evil and mental health”.

NRA offers throwaway concessions like bump stocks.

NRA packages these like Wall Street did synthetic CDO junk and and peddle as a AAA-grade solution to their death machine.

4774 2018-02-24 03:30:18 Snap's shares "plummeted" after Kylie Jenner tweeted that she was ditching Snapchat, but stocks in gun companies were only "dragged lower" after a mass shooting?
4775 2018-02-24 03:30:16 But I agree they should ban bump stocks
4776 2018-02-24 03:29:41 In the end we disagree but I’ll do something nice for you I’ll make you Rich.. wait 4-5 months and drop every dime you have into gun stocks.. wait till the next catastrophe and sell.. rinse repeat.. you know since it won’t hurt your feelings
4777 2018-02-24 03:29:15 @RokuPlayer @YouTube @Apple @AmazonStudios Your client NRA defends the slaughter of children. And Smith and Wesson stocks are tanking.
4778 2018-02-24 03:28:24 I would argue kind of a stretch- M&A events move stocks in any industry. What is unique with Snap (and tech in general) is the stated belief by most VC investors that these companies have big barriers to entry.....then to see wild swings like this week.
4779 2018-02-24 03:28:04 The guy knows his stocks. Him and his wife are really on their shit when it comes to that stuff. That being said, JBL is still a cunt rag, that i can't stand lol
4780 2018-02-24 03:27:47 Whether cryptos stocks or real estate I don't know if we'll ever see substained wealth come so easily as it has over the last 1 year plus. I'm invested 20 years plus, but new to cryptos. Live well America!
4781 2018-02-24 03:26:48 Regulating the thing that bump stocks get attached to might an idea.
4782 2018-02-24 03:26:02 It's apparently not illegal to modify all firearms, since Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock modified his legally bought AR-15 style rifles with legally bought bump-stocks. Maybe we should pass laws to make bump-stocks illegal.
4783 2018-02-24 03:25:28 Remember when Starbucks tried those measures? They came graveling back when their stocks started to tank!
4784 2018-02-24 03:25:12 Ever hear of bump stocks?
4785 2018-02-24 03:24:42 We were on a similar path after Las Vegas with bump stocks and that fell off. Hopefully the sensible reforms currently being put forward are put in place. 21 to purchase weapons, ban on bump stocks, and the cool off period applying to all guns seems reasonable to me.
4786 2018-02-24 03:24:30 They better not stop. These politicians think they can throw a few crumbs and it will all go away. Look how many died before, even babies and nothing was done. After Las Vegas Trump said he would take a look at bump stocks. Nothing happened.
4787 2018-02-24 03:24:24 ...also federal universal background checks, requiring domestic abusers to surrender their weapons if they're convicted of domestic assault or are under a restraining order, and banning bump stocks. (Just  examples). -- Also, "ban guns" requires a Constitutional amendment.
4788 2018-02-24 03:22:37 Exactly....let the ones who are willing and able do it. Not a single teacher will be forced to do it. Heck Trump even said today that he’s for increasing the age to buy, no bump-stocks and stricter background checks. Progress is being made
4789 2018-02-24 03:22:09 @AmericanFunds I was so sad to read today that American Funds invests in gun manufacturing.  There are so many other greater things I would prefer my retirement money to be invested in.  Please reconsider including those stocks in the mutual funds that I am investing in.
4790 2018-02-24 03:22:00 I’m talking about the banning of bump stocks & preventing anyone under 21 getting guns.
4791 2018-02-24 03:21:43 Congress should move forward on gun reforms suggested by Trump & Rubio-
Minimum gun purchase age of 21; Outlaw bump stocks;
Ban large capacity magazines; Universal background checks- no more loopholes.
@GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
4792 2018-02-24 03:21:27 Epic. Sheriff counter responds to Loesch when she half evades Emma's question by focusing on just Bump Stocks ( an issue the NRA is fine w banning since they don't rep manufacturers) but doesn't respond to limiting ASSAULT WEAPONS. 
No civilian needs deadly weapon of WAR
4793 2018-02-24 03:20:38 Time, stocks, and ideas.
4794 2018-02-24 03:20:01 I don't use bump stocks, I don't like the feel of them when I'm hunting. However, I don't have a problem with them for self defense.
4795 2018-02-24 03:18:50 lmao I forgot to add with bump stocks & in no way was my tweet offensive to police officers or military personnel
4796 2018-02-24 03:18:13 Bump-Stocks are a GIMMICK & Gimmicks are NO Place for Firearms ~ No 1 loves/respects guns more than me ~ been shooting since 12 yrs old ~ Bump Stocks were & are a 'stupid as hell idea'.
4797 2018-02-24 03:18:06 I’m not supporting the NRA, but I support freedom of speech and opinion. I don’t believe assault rifles should be banned because they are of importance to hunters, but I do believe in extreme regulation on bump stocks and increasing the age from 18 to 21 for buying rifles.
4798 2018-02-24 03:18:05 No soldiers in schools.

It's UNCONSTITUTIONAL for the military to be used as police forces. We can't start down that slippery slope. Ever.

More guns is NOT the answer.

Restrict mag sizes. Make bkgrd checks and mental fitness exams national law. Ban bump stocks.
4799 2018-02-24 03:18:04 FTIL case: Sebi disposes of show cause notices against 5 persons #stocks #tips #bse
4800 2018-02-24 03:16:35 You want to explain to me what the NRA is willing to bring to the table?  No ban on bump stocks, no ban on ARs, no raising age limit, no mental health requirements. Don’t both sides if your side is doing shit all.
4801 2018-02-24 03:16:16 Gartman “I’m short stocks” + @CNBC “Markets in Turmoil” = Super long buy

Gartman “I’m long stocks” + @CNBC “How to buy XRP” = GTFO
4802 2018-02-24 03:15:50 homes are not stocks, John. Re-think this argument.
4803 2018-02-24 03:15:15 can't agree. Unlike bonds, stocks don't have a static ROE. And ROE will go up during inflation, if business has pricing power
4804 2018-02-24 03:15:03 Hahahaha, you think this will work? You not buying gun stocks just means more shares for others around the world.
4805 2018-02-24 03:14:59 Time to buy more US stocks so.
4806 2018-02-24 03:14:43 Exactly ! Keep your guns ... lets ban “AK15 style” guns and bump stocks or any other modifications that allow a higher and more damaging fire rate - let’s give intended victims a chance to live through a gun incident  - until we can stop all gun violence #ProtectAmericans
4807 2018-02-24 03:14:16 Ban bump stocks. Raise rifle purchasing age to 21.
4808 2018-02-24 03:14:14 My congressional rep, Tom Rice of SC, today stated ok to raising age limits, no to bump stocks, need to do background checks.  But would not consider banning assault weapons from civilians hands.  Even after an ex CIA told him all her military
4809 2018-02-24 03:14:02 lol at people who use the fucking stocks as a metric for how the economy is going. 1; they're crashing and 2; people are still dying of poverty.
4810 2018-02-24 03:13:45 @IngrahamAngle Hi Laura.  LOVE your show. Apparently, these companies turning their backs on the NRA has forgotten what happens when conservatives choose to boycott!!!! Good luck to their stocks!!! Not.
4811 2018-02-24 03:12:33 One more thing that most of the world ban is bullet proof vests to civilians so that the police with handguns are useless in stopping the shooter
Once bump stocks assault weapons and 100 round clips are banned
Lets make a law that all legal guns are painted hot pink and unmanly
4812 2018-02-24 03:12:29 We are talking about anytown, USA...

no tanks...

A novice with a couple bump stocks could hold his own for a while and do serious damage against local police force guy and his 9mm and shotgun...

What is the argument FOR bump stocks? 

Why should they be protected and legal?
4813 2018-02-24 03:11:09 Now this is interesting. Don't stocks usually go up after mass shootings? I mean either way it is good news they are down but this could be signaling a real change.
4814 2018-02-24 03:10:51  Our sons and daughters were stolen by another people
 The sale of bump stocks will be completely banned under the proposal
4815 2018-02-24 03:10:31 bad move!  Enjoy your stocks dropping and business failing.
4816 2018-02-24 03:08:22 Your local police force or mid western town sheriffs department doesn't have fully automatic rifles Terry, 

Most likely first responders have sidearm, and shotguns... the tactical units and swat have semi auto high power rifles.

But against a couple of bump stocks? Pinned down
4817 2018-02-24 03:08:02 Please dont, I like your research and would very much like to see you tweeting commentaries on stocks.
4818 2018-02-24 03:08:00 We don't, which is why confiscating bump stocks doesn't make Chris Christie a RINO.
4819 2018-02-24 03:07:11 Fully automatic rifles are already illegal. People not knowing what they are talking about is the problem. Want to get rid of bump stocks fine lets talk but not knowing what you want gone isn’t going to solve anything. How do you expect to reach a compromise without some research
4820 2018-02-24 03:07:09 I separated from the AF in Sept and began trading part-time. Got right into MJ stocks and thought they would sustain my weekly average of +27%...we all have our shameful moments.
4821 2018-02-24 03:07:02 Super rich shareholders?   Everyday folks own stocks too.  You really are out of touch, but hey your entire life has been on the public dole..at taxpayer expense.  Time for a change.  #Caseymustgo. #useless
4822 2018-02-24 03:06:55 How about keeping the guns capable of being legally purchased, often en masse, by these "mentally ill" "lone wolves" off the streets?

Who genuinely needs semiautomatic rifles with 30 round magazines, let alone high volume ones or fun little add-ons like bump stocks?

4825 2018-02-24 03:05:56 Don't stocks go up more than they go down because of Fed-engineered inflation of the US dollar to goose employment & the economy with ample cheap money and debt? The price of a pair of fine-crafted Johnston & Murphy men's wingtip leather dress shoes in 1932: $10.50.

4829 2018-02-24 03:03:53 The blame goes to NRA due to their continued prioritization of whipping up their base ahead of common sense laws. Tracking gun thefts. Mandatory report stolen guns. Mandatory state reporting to NICS. Ban bump stocks. Lower capacity magazines. All things NRA oppose.
4830 2018-02-24 03:03:23 I true (I mean, it's @CNN), once they say the sales after your Town Hall, those stocks will fly. Thank you. The best ad for NRA and why you need weapons against Tyrany.
4831 2018-02-24 03:03:19 There’s so many other stocks doing well YTD. Boeing, Nvidia, Caterpillar, Square, Adobe, JP Morgan, LMT, etc....come on bro
4832 2018-02-24 03:02:22 True loli was just making a statement on the first tweet you made. People should still be able to have guns not saying to ban all guns. Just felt maybe if they had more restrictions on guns letting off several rounds at a time many kids in
4833 2018-02-24 03:01:28 What part about we want all assault rifles banned do you not understand? No guns before 21. No bump stocks. Waiting period. Background checks.  Very common sense to those of us not making money killing people.
4834 2018-02-24 03:01:20 Hey, okay. So ban bump stocks today. That's a good start.
4835 2018-02-24 03:00:48 That is a lack of basketball IQ!  He’s right handed. Force him to take a pull up.  @Bucks
4836 2018-02-24 03:00:47 Anytime a weapon can fire 50 to 100 rounds in a minute it is to dangerous for many Ppl. Bump stocks made it almost full automatic. But most can change it in seconds to full auto. This weapon wasn't designed for the public. It is a war weapon.
4837 2018-02-24 03:00:11 That is a lack of basketball IQ!  He’s right handed. Force him to take a pull up.
4838 2018-02-24 03:00:10 Banning bump stocks and arming teachers....you are seriously deranged @realDonaldTrump

4841 2018-02-24 02:59:31 The state's with the restrictions also have not stopped people from using them. Has an affect but nothing that stops them completely sadly.
4842 2018-02-24 02:58:31 Didn't you block many proposals that would have let the FBI do more of their job? 
Also, what happened to you doing something about bump stocks?
Oh yeah, that's right, you don't care.

Now the next step ACTION
BS!!! No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.

IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH
EVEN 1 LIFE?

4849 2018-02-24 02:55:52 The amount of sunburn my face has received in the last 4 days is ridiculous not everything about baseball season is enjoyable
4850 2018-02-24 02:55:39 The option trading is so much different from stocks - the payoff is huge. We are in tricky market right now and even if you do pick right ones understanding pricing is tricky. At the end of Day there are people like me that want to just have a little extra security.
4851 2018-02-24 02:55:18 LOL, of course this is the reaction he wants. Less-than-half-measures like bump stocks are just an excuse for the 'see??? he can do what the dems can't!!!' garbage.

Meanwhile, he wants dumb crap like arming teachers. No meaningful gun legislation has been passed or will be.
4852 2018-02-24 02:55:14 day 1 of snow in Vancouver: wait what 

day 3: roads are closed. the power flickers 

day 5: complete grid shutdown. all communication with the outside world has stopped. frozen cars litter the streets. food stocks are low. the government has abandoned us. god has abandoned us.
4853 2018-02-24 02:55:08 No one can say with a straight face that banning bump stocks will prevent a single school shooting. BTW, the government can't legally ban bump stocks as they are not regulable by any federal agency.
4854 2018-02-24 02:55:01 Put him in stocks at the school gate. Colldct all the rotten food & eggs and let rip. Then tar & feather him. Let the parents stand by and do nothing.
4855 2018-02-24 02:54:56 Did your gun "stocks" get a "bump". Maybe you can take Stormy out again with your gains.
4856 2018-02-24 02:54:40 Ar 15 is not high power. A 30-06 is a much more potent round but most of those rifles have non scary wooden stocks.

4858 2018-02-24 02:53:49 Some states already have restrictions against large capacity ammunition magazines, and some have banned AR style rifles. But in the hunting case, it is very rare to see someone use a clip that size, and they're not supposed to. It's usually used at the shooting range for sport.
4859 2018-02-24 02:52:52 If I hadn't just invested $105,000 in my business is buy gun stocks now. They will go back up again
4860 2018-02-24 02:52:42 Today in Trump world.  My taxes are lower, I won't be paying an Obamacare penalty and my stocks are kicking it.  Not sure what world Politico lives in but it's not mine.
4861 2018-02-24 02:51:32 I have yet to hear a compelling argument for a bump stock, besides open warfare.  They decrease accuracy while mimicking a fully auto, thus allowing for maximum damage & expenditure of lead

A civilian can outgun law enforcement with a couple bump stocks and about 1000 ends. Why?
4862 2018-02-24 02:50:48 collapsible stocks make a gun much more portable and easier to hide.

4864 2018-02-24 02:48:24 @dersoto62 yep. I’ll be long commodities, and short stocks here in a little bit.  Wi don’t know if we will get anything major until
4865 2018-02-24 02:48:11 Bump stocks are legal though. There’s no searchable registry for gun ownership, which makes gun trafficking a million times easier. there are so many steps between banning guns and arming teachers, and instead of taking those steps everyone argues about going all or nothing.
4866 2018-02-24 02:47:48 Do you mean mutual funds, capital investments, stocks, ETFs...could you clarify?
4867 2018-02-24 02:46:41 Didn’t 50 Cent do this a few years back with penny stocks?
4868 2018-02-24 02:46:30 Just to let you know..In 2010. Bump stocks were approved too be sold to the public..guess who was the President? Yep, that's right..OBAMA!!!.. Now are you going to hiss and boo him.. I bet not.
4869 2018-02-24 02:45:55 All teachers should demand that gun stocks be divested from retirement funds.
4870 2018-02-24 02:45:09 That is a semi automatic rifle with modifications. Pistol grips, handrails, and collapsible stocks don't do anything to the rifle's functionality. They change the look. That's why I compared them to sports cars. They're trying to ban scary looking guns, not more deadly guns.
4871 2018-02-24 02:43:30 Keep trying. When you get the ceasefire be alert for attacks on UN & ICRC stocks

4874 2018-02-24 02:40:54 Using your reasoning, banning "bump stocks" will do nothing. A bump stock uses the recoil action to help your finger pull the trigger faster. It's the physical abilities of the operator on how fast you can fire a semi-automatic.
4875 2018-02-24 02:40:52 About Time!  How long will it take for the rest of the USA to do the same?  How much longer is going to take Federal Rep.'s to eliminate weapons of war to be available to the general public & large ammo magazines, bump stocks?
4876 2018-02-24 02:40:51 Obama approved Bump Stocks.  Trump getting rid of them.
4877 2018-02-24 02:40:45 getting a age limit and getting rid of the stocks is a good idea. And the mental cherck,but anything else isnt going to happen. Those 4 coward cops at your school deserve your anger more though.

4883 2018-02-24 02:35:52 My stocks are both looking pretty good.
4884 2018-02-24 02:35:08 imma go up like the stocks 
4885 2018-02-24 02:34:39 Very true. I first saw videos of people "bump firing" years ago, and heard about bump stocks some time later. From the very start, people were commenting "this is going to get used in a mass shooting and then banned."
4886 2018-02-24 02:33:59 Stocks for the medium term, options for the short term. Nothing forever
4887 2018-02-24 02:33:23 Agreed! If it wasn’t for all this talk about banning AR-15’s and bump stocks, I would never have bought them. Since they took this route, I bought 5 of each!
4888 2018-02-24 02:33:07 Hey. Wall Street - divest gun stocks NOW!! #BoycottNRA
4889 2018-02-24 02:32:37 @Parianas @_machiparu_ @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
4890 2018-02-24 02:31:42 There is a line - military weapons. No one is suggesting that full auto guns be legal. Many support banning bump stocks. There is a line and even reasonable #gunrights people can agree. We shut down when confronted with demands for bans and knee jerk screaming from some.
4891 2018-02-24 02:31:37 Lonnas insanity increases as kmarts stocks rise!!! It’s all connected! They are in collusion and committing mad racketeering. This is all legal abuse. They are trying to inflict trauma.
4892 2018-02-24 02:31:10 You mean when he authorized bump stocks?
4893 2018-02-24 02:30:42 NO VOLLUME NOWHERE MARK YOU ARE RIGHT THIS SUCKY MARKET 3 STOCKS THEY SAID TODAY COMPRISED 50 PERCENT OF NASDAQ GAIN , NOONE IN MARKET, NOONE TALKS OF IT , IM TIRED OF THIS 'BULL MARKET', NOONE SHOULD HAVE LOSSES
4894 2018-02-24 02:29:55 I have sold all my @RokuPlayer stocks today as they support the @NRA @NRATV
@ShaunKing #StopNRAmazon
@amazon I will be cancelling my prime membership next. Going with @Walmart who just acquired @Jet
4895 2018-02-24 02:29:28 Haha yep. And now when it changes to actual stocks you’ll be looking at the Dow more often.
4896 2018-02-24 02:28:34 Obama is back in the Whitehouse? I heard the current president order the jutice department to ban bump stocks just this week, which is already more gun control than Obama accomplished in 8 years.
4897 2018-02-24 02:28:04 $PYPL price targets or possibly $83-$86 all time highs. Payment stocks on the rise along with $V $MA $SQ. #OptionPros Trading Alerts!

4900 2018-02-24 02:26:33 Do you think that the left will stop at "Assult Weapons" or Bump Stocks? Next it will be any semi-auto firearm including handguns, then pump and lever guns, then bolt action then just every gun will be banned. But I don't think they will stop at just the second amendment.
4901 2018-02-24 02:25:55 The BIGGEST problem with most "common sense" proposals is that they lack the requisite common sense. Examples:
Feinstein - folding stocks make rifles more lethal
Magazine size - what diff does it make if the Cretin isn't taking return fire?
4902 2018-02-24 02:25:47 Watching the face morph veto competition makes me want to go re-watch the #BBOTT comp where @ShelbyStockton1 blows it out of the water! Oh, and @morgan_willett did okay too  #bestcomp #favoriteplayers #BBCeleb
4903 2018-02-24 02:24:56 The BIGGEST problem with most "common sense" proposals is that they lack the requisite common sense. Examples:
Feinstein - folding stocks make rifles more lethal
Magazine size - what diff does it make if the Cretin isn't take return fire?
4904 2018-02-24 02:24:11 I'd like to see you and your 4 rounds deal with a charging black bear or boar in thick brush.  Btw my comments are only about the 4 round clip, nothing else. Or someone trying to attack you.  It's very hard to hit moving targets. Bump stocks are useless and should be banned.
4905 2018-02-24 02:24:07 Of course it is. Almost all the stocks had 1/2 or 2/3 of daily trading volume. And not much higher volume in the last one hour of rallying time either. % they move up/down is so similar, you can put many charts and they will be identical. Computer algo is getting ridiculous.
4906 2018-02-24 02:23:32 @DLoesch where do you stand on the @nra advocating increased regs or banning of bump stocks? That doesn’t sound like protecting the 2nd amendment to me. Shall not be infringed?
4907 2018-02-24 02:23:27 Ban assault weapons, ban high capacity mags for everything but rimfire weapons, ban bump-fire stocks, don't allow people on watch lists to buy guns, and mandatory background checks for every gun purchase.  That's common sense and realistic.
4908 2018-02-24 02:23:11 Watch their stocks plummet. Boycotts have begun already. NRA membership is going up.
4909 2018-02-24 02:22:40 Guns are okay, IMO. But bump stocks and AR-15s? No. Let’s change things. Kids are too precious.
4910 2018-02-24 02:22:39 Yes I know. The AR 15 is the same gun as the M 16, except that it is semi automatic rather than fully automatic. But bump stocks can make it fully automatic. So tell me why it should be legal for non military to have a gun that is basically the same as a military weapon?
4911 2018-02-24 02:21:57 Well actually this is really the first time so many mass protests have taken place after an incident like this on a large scale and it's already having effects (like trump suggesting banning bump stocks)
4912 2018-02-24 02:21:55 Bump stocks yes should be illegal, or anything that makes it an automatic, people have killed people with cars driving into crowds. So should cars be banned? #StudentsStandUp
4913 2018-02-24 02:21:38 People's who's children have died in a school shooting with an AR-15 assault riffle are naturally going to want more gun control regarding the AR-15 and bump stocks. Emergency Room Dr said, had the injuries come from a hand gun ppl would have lived.

4918 2018-02-24 02:19:43 Wow, thank you for the info @TT45Pac Twitter stocks are dropping!!!
4919 2018-02-24 02:19:14 Story in the paper today about gun stocks soaring. 1st, utterly disgusting & 2nd, how much do U want to bet some politicians made money off the stock prices rising drastically? Our whole fuc*ing system is broken. Kids are murdered in cold blood but Wall St. makes money off of it.
4920 2018-02-24 02:18:32 They have a multitude of funds and stocks. Every index fund will have guns. But if you want to go elsewhere and pay a big front-end or back-end load feel free. @Fidelity upped their fees in a sneaky backhanded way so stay away from them anyway.
4921 2018-02-24 02:17:34 We ALL want an end to civilian killings, children, and adults, an end to all killings would be even better! Bump stocks seem like a needless add-on! The screening could get problematic. "Redheads are too volatile; Cut school in 6th grade; etc!"
4922 2018-02-24 02:17:18 Daming stocks
4923 2018-02-24 02:17:08 Spot on forecast for 2022 it was. The environmental degradation, wealth inequality, misogyny, global warming, depleted ocean fish stocks, etc...
4924 2018-02-24 02:15:25 Can't fathom a good reason bump stocks are legal.  Ridiculous they are legal.  End result is an automatic weapon but because they don't "technically" modify they are legal. Sad.
4925 2018-02-24 02:15:23 *coffee break tweet*
Sooo... I ditched my consultation schedule today for a room genclean. Ate breakfast, threw the garbage, did the laundry, got stocks, cleaned the floor, washed the dishes, arranged my room -- all done less than 3 hours! I'm a proud tita.
4926 2018-02-24 02:14:57 Just tell em to invest in pog stocks.
4927 2018-02-24 02:14:44 Buy Marco Rubio and do sell more guns: AR-15s, expanded magazines, and bumps stocks!  Me 9:13
4928 2018-02-24 02:14:06 The NRA contributes money to political campaigns leaving our politicians beholden to NRA leading to their cowardice in not passing laws banning military grade weapons, bump stocks, etc. which have been used in the massacre of children and adult. Is that clear enough for you?
4929 2018-02-24 02:13:21 I'm ok with deeper background checks and raising the age, but we don't need to ban bump stocks
4930 2018-02-24 02:13:14 1)Ryan Zinke, Trump’s sectry of the Interior,has been caught hiding a financial interest in a firearms company.

He did not disclose that he holds shares in PROOF Research Inc.PROOF’s website notes that it manufactures “composite barrels, stocks, and complete rifles”.
4931 2018-02-24 02:13:09 Serious Q. for #2A advocates: Why should #AR15 be legal? Semi automatic? Bump stocks? Is there ANY #gun that SHOULDN'T be? Where do you draw the line? Why?
4932 2018-02-24 02:13:00 5.) Ban of “bump-stocks”
6.) Removing the exemption for concealed weapons license holders from the existing waiting period on handgunsPlease email or call your legislators IMMEDIATELY and ask them to focus on fixing our broken mental health system and improving school security,
4933 2018-02-24 02:12:37 There’s certain stocks, high capacity magazines, grips etc that turn the AR-15 from a hunting rifle to a killing machine. The caliber, velocity, etc aren’t unique. It’s the modifications that make it unique
4934 2018-02-24 02:12:19 Obama signed bump stocks into law. Trump said there were going to be changes. Let’s see.
4935 2018-02-24 02:10:54 yess. and again limited na naman dw yung stocks. . . 
4936 2018-02-24 02:10:37 This dude that I frequently see on Bart always pulls up his brokerage app to check how his stocks did for the day. Today I peaked...$1.98M #canihaveadollar?
4937 2018-02-24 02:10:33 President Trump has already taken action on gun control including background, mental health, bump stocks, purchase age. And what does CNN want, to keep our schools gun free zones, while CNN execs and journalists stay safe behind armed security.
4938 2018-02-24 02:10:32 Yeah dont ban the gun, just ban anyone able to build there own or customize it !! Than your right, its just like the other rifles.  You shouldnt be able to buy bump stocks or anything else for it.  Make it come as is OEM !!
4939 2018-02-24 02:09:52 Dividend yield is a strange metric when stocks are falling
4940 2018-02-24 02:09:04 Hell no. Whaddya you got? Three suspended POS stocks. PJ has no idea of Ekejija's smelly history. At all.
4941 2018-02-24 02:08:54 Yes different but could have reduced by some sort of regulation like removing bump stocks. My point is take actions that reduce the amount of deaths that will occur during the next one. Also I rather take my chances with him and a rifle than his spray technique
4942 2018-02-24 02:08:46 "Live rent free with your parents"
"Sell some stocks if you're strapped for cash"
4943 2018-02-24 02:07:27 Buy gold, silver and cryptos while u can. Hedge against fiat, property, and stocks and their rising potential for a cataclysmic downfall.
4944 2018-02-24 02:06:55 U'll never get any of this to pass. Pvt citizens owning guns is what keeps the right to bear arms intact. To protect the people from the state. Banning bump stocks is a great idea. Flagging ppl who buy big amounts of ammo is a good idea. CDC research is a great idea
4945 2018-02-24 02:06:22 Russian sanctions now. Ban bump stocks ban AR-15s register all guns. Then resign.
4946 2018-02-24 02:06:19 And now do same chart for Boeing vs. other top dow stocks. Amazon 9% of Nasdaq. Boeing almost 10% in price wtd Dow. They’re all that matters.
4947 2018-02-24 02:05:54 Again under pressure, Justice Department plods toward regulation of bump stocks?? Makes you wonder who the DOJ is and who they care about??!
4948 2018-02-24 02:05:35 The bubble. Stocks and real estate. Here we go again....
4949 2018-02-24 02:05:24 News flash @DLoesch the MSM is not for sale! Yes, it does its job reporting shootings that we all want to learn about but DOES NOT BENEFIT FINANCIALLY like the NRA does, w/ surges in gun sales and soon to be banned bump stocks etc. #GunReformNow #BanNRA
4950 2018-02-24 02:05:22 The AR-15 (to take an example) isn’t scary per se because you can use .223, but the idea of bump stocks and larger magazines scares the shit out of me.
4951 2018-02-24 02:04:25 @blackrock   We urge you to sever any investments with or for the NRA.  Many of your investors unwittingly have stocks that have investments in gun makers, sellers etc and would be outraged.
4952 2018-02-24 02:04:24 Military grade guns that nobody needs to own. Ever. High capacity magazines and bump stocks. Australia did it right. America needs to follow. Just make it harder for people who shouldn’t have them to get them.
4953 2018-02-24 02:04:20 Ya I’ve heard of things like that. Bump stocks do that too. But those mods should all be illegal just like real automatic weapons are. Heard of ppl modifying clips to have full banana clips too. Those mods should all be illegal
4954 2018-02-24 02:04:19 They are NOT TEENAGERS. THEY ARE YOUNG ADULTS.
ARTICULATE, WELL INFORMED
AND WILLING TO SPEAK.
NO ONE WANTS TO BAN ALL GUNS! JUST MILITARY WEAPONS and Bump Stocks
Ban Assault Weapons for purchase by Civilians of any age.
4955 2018-02-24 02:03:14 @FoxNews President Trump has already showed more willingness to take action on gun control from all areas. Background, mental health, purchase age, bump stocks, school security. The left only offers to ban guns. It's time for Democrats and left media to shut up and put up.
4956 2018-02-24 02:02:13 @SethMacFarlane How long after they arm the teachers will the NRA start pushing the right weapons for taking down jack booted teachers? "What's the only thing that stops a bad teacher with a gun? A good student with a gun? Don't be a victim. Back to school discount on bump stocks
4957 2018-02-24 02:01:30 @POTUS has already called for raising the age limit to 21 as well as outlawing bump stocks. Didn't @CNN and @MSNBC report that? #bumpstocks #raisetheage
4958 2018-02-24 02:01:28 A bill was put before Congress after Las Vegas shooting to ban bump stocks. Why don't you enlighten us on what happened. Trump banning bump stocks has nothing to do with an AR-15. Trump is throwing the public a bone figuring he'll get the least resistance from the NRA

#BanAR15s
4959 2018-02-24 01:59:53 He talked with survivors, talked about banning bump stocks, talked about arming teachers & early on rolled back regulations on gun ownership for individuals with mental health issues, I wouldn't say he's done anything to fix the situation
4960 2018-02-24 01:59:31 Big bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala sounded sceptic and raised his concern about future of Indian equities if the profit/returns expectations of Indian stocks are not met. He said that while markets are at historic highs, they are not ready to go down, yet.
4961 2018-02-24 01:58:40 State of WA bans bump stocks. #GunContolNow #bumpstocks
4962 2018-02-24 01:58:24 She tweeted that she isn’t using twitter anymore and @Snap stocks fell 6%.
4963 2018-02-24 01:57:58 I don't own a gun but support someone who passes a background check to do so.  I fall in the middle of the debate. People kill people, but background checks, and bans of assault weapons/bump stocks seem to be a reasonable balance
4964 2018-02-24 01:56:36 @Hertz @Avis @Budget @MetLif @NortonOnline @SimpliSafe You gave into liberal pressure and isolated millions of responsible gun owners. We in turn will NEVER patronize your businesses again. Watch your stocks tumble.  #NRABoycott #2A #IStandWithTheNRA
4965 2018-02-24 01:56:33 Bump stocks are not firearms and I don't think criminals or crazy people should have firearms. My reference was to changing the legal age to own a firearm.
4966 2018-02-24 01:56:27 You'd think this guy would've done a bit more DD before jumping in at the high. This trend weed stocks are in could last for some time still.
4967 2018-02-24 01:55:27 Why only the Bump Stocks & not the assault rifles? There is NO REASON 2 own them. If the testosterone needs the thrill, then not own, just rent at a secured place w/target area. If not good enough, then there is a bigger problem. Forefathers NEVER dreamed of these type of guns.
4968 2018-02-24 01:55:09 I also love that they’re moving towards individual stocks as well.
4969 2018-02-24 01:54:53 What I want:
 No large magazines or bump stocks
 universal background checks
 testing & licensing
 No gun show/private sale loopholes!
 No guns for domestic abusers
 No guns for people who have a history of being a danger to themselves or others
4970 2018-02-24 01:53:59 @BestWestern @Wyndham  You gave into liberal pressure and isolated millions of responsible gun owners. We in turn will NEVER patronize your businesses again.  Watch your stocks tumble.  #NRABoycott #2A #IStandWithTheNRA
4971 2018-02-24 01:53:42 Bump stocks do not make a weapon automatic. They just fire faster. There is still one trigger pull per round fired. None of those other things you mentioned are constitutional rights.
4972 2018-02-24 01:53:38 Then you know that “Assault Rifles” do nothing more than other rifles, some with wooden stocks, that are semi-auto. It’s just that they look menacing. It’s all cosmetic.
4973 2018-02-24 01:53:24 Pseudo solutions of banning bump stocks are just shit.
4974 2018-02-24 01:53:07 Catch up, Drew. Restrictions on who can get guns: limit violent offenders, terrorists, felons, under age ppl. National registry. Ban bump stocks and semi automatic weapons. Tucker feigning concern over a scripted question is laughable.
4975 2018-02-24 01:51:19 Truth

Still doesn't excuse your constant desire to value AR15 over Children. Bump stocks over concert goers. Guns over life. #NeverAgain
4976 2018-02-24 01:51:05 Typical liberal picking on every little thing! And beside stocks in Cat have soared since Trump took office!
4977 2018-02-24 01:50:53 As someone in the military, and a gunsmith in training I can tell you there are actually many many hoops to jump through to make a full auto firearm, and they are making it hard to get ones hands on bump stocks as well, which I have no issue with. But I do use my ar for fun, as
4978 2018-02-24 01:50:53 A significant % of which are gun owners. A significant % are for common sense gun regulations such as banning bump stocks and improved background checks. You know what doesn't have a significant % of support? Banning guns, like the crowd at the CNN town hall cheered for
4979 2018-02-24 01:50:46 this is why you don't go into stocks of social media
4980 2018-02-24 01:50:30 Bump stocks are hard to get or use? I’m not worried about qualified trained law abiding people when it comes to guns, planes, cars, trains or any other useful and necessary thing that when used for evil purposes will kill many. Strict regulation not elimination. Why not for guns?
4981 2018-02-24 01:49:52 I didn’t think people who bought stocks took advice from Kylie Jenner.
4982 2018-02-24 01:49:36 #BreakNRA The public can do this. @NRA and Congress can agree to #BanAndBuyback all assault weapons, bump stocks, and large magazines. We won’t stop until this law changes. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP #bumpstocks #BoycottNRA @waynelapierrejr

4991 2018-02-24 01:45:50 By that logic, you couldn't care less if American citizens had access to full-auto receivers on assault weapons. Bump stocks on semi-autos can exceed the fire rate of their full-auto counterparts. Gun tech has now surpassed/circumvented regulations, it's time to catch up.

4997 2018-02-24 01:42:34 Of course we are we did it with Kellogg their stocks went down
4998 2018-02-24 01:41:33 Yes! It was on 9/10/17 on 4chan warning about the #LasVegasShooting & MGM Grand CEO Jim Murren who sits on DHS (& sold 80% of his MGM stocks 2wks prior to Shooting) would buy XRay back-scatter machine’s from The Chertoff Group (Michael Chertoff wrote Patriot Act).

THEY DO NOT SPEAK FOR ME ANYMORE!

I'm OK with:

BG checks
10 RD Magazines
Waiting periods
21 Yrs Old to purchase
No Bump Stocks or Trigger Cranks
5001 2018-02-24 01:39:42 @TrumpMindLeaks has reported that @NextRevFNC is code word for “Race Wars”. Democrats immediately saw the connection while the Republicans were still celebrating their “sneakiness” with the creation of more “crisis actor” stories and buying stocks in the gun market
5002 2018-02-24 01:39:40 For all politicians out there in the Twitterverse, I'll make it simple for you: If you vote against banning semiautomatic weapons, against stricter gun laws, against banning bump stocks... I'll vote against you. #NeverAgain
5003 2018-02-24 01:39:19 Thanks for this super helpful graphic Marco, now let’s ban semis, high capacity mags, bump stocks, raise the age, require training, mental health assessment, thorough background checks. All of these common sense ideas are proven to reduce gun violence.
5004 2018-02-24 01:39:12 Let me put it to you this way, in the vain hope you'll prove teachable: it does not follow from the fact the Fed is not mandated to ensure stocks go up that Schiff's observation about it's options is wrong.
5005 2018-02-24 01:38:45 I support the #SecondAmendment 
But I believe assault weapons & bump stocks should be banned, teachers should not #ConcealCarry and the #NRAIsATerroristOrganization 
This isn’t a black & white issue. Many of us own firearms but believe this issue is out of control!
5006 2018-02-24 01:38:27 It's a small step.  Need elimination of assault weapons.  Easy to get rid of bump stocks.  Small profits for NRA compared to assault weapons.
5007 2018-02-24 01:38:14 Federally funded security for every public school in America.  Better vetting process for purchases of semi-auto rifles.  Stop selling high capacity magazines, bump stocks and anything else that makes killing hundreds in minutes easy. Mental health checks and drug testing.
5008 2018-02-24 01:38:04 $ WUHN- to all the ignorant fools, newbies and experienced , 95 percent of these stocks are diluted pigs . Stop buying stocks that keep diluting you won’t see a dime .  Wuhn just did reverse merger float around 5 million much more to come. $$$$$$$$.
5009 2018-02-24 01:37:20 lmao snap fixed its update like two days after kylie tweeted about it & their stocks dropped, now only if the government would listen to its ppl as well as snap does :,)
5010 2018-02-24 01:36:35 AR-15's, any high capacity magazines, trigger enhancements and bump stocks. Along with universal "better background checks" that would be a good start
5011 2018-02-24 01:36:08 Uber and Lyft have crushed rental car stocks
5012 2018-02-24 01:36:04 ドムセヘビーユーザーだしナナコカード作ろうかな
5013 2018-02-24 01:35:36 Cus you are ok azfl and you are talking shit about a company that has a product on the market .  You can’t posdobly be serious . If you are not happy then get out stop buying stocks that dilute
5014 2018-02-24 01:35:22 Bump stocks are fucking stupid and I care zero if they're banned specifically.

The problem is the slippery slope that tends to become real with ban-happy people.
5015 2018-02-24 01:35:07 Follow the money. Universities and all nonprofits should divest of any and all stocks related to guns and ammunition. #BoycottNRA #NRABloodMoney #DivestNRA #divestgunmanufacuters #divestinallthingsnra #WeCallBS #MSDStrong #March4OurLives
5016 2018-02-24 01:35:02 The company needs to not only pay back the $ but be severely punished. People are dying because their crops and fields were destroyed, their stores were unreachable with no stocks, no banks because no electricity, no food or fresh water #4shame @SRuhle @JoyAnnReid @NydiaVelazquez
5017 2018-02-24 01:34:45 Like so many. Once they’re confident those types are shaken out, they’ll run the stocks and get him chasing, squeezing him for half of his balance. Rinse. And repeat. This place shows no mercy.
5018 2018-02-24 01:34:25 So if the bump stocks are NOT banned, blame the ATF for it..don't blame Trump-He's the one that ordered it, and they said No..
5019 2018-02-24 01:34:22 We need more then elimination of bump stocks, we need elimination of assault weapons.
5020 2018-02-24 01:33:22 Wala ng pag-asa yung mga bluechips stocks ko. Bente ko na 'to lahat. Azar.
5021 2018-02-24 01:33:15 -[WHERE IS @FA1RYJIMIN]-

Does anyone know how to contact @FA1RYJIMIN??

I ordered on her BT21 GO last December, that hasn't been pushed through because of the limited stocks.

She said she'll refund my money and even gave a date but untill now she hasn't given me any money

5022 2018-02-24 01:32:54 No one wants to ban ALL guns! Just bump stocks and semi auto.
5023 2018-02-24 01:32:46 My parents were just talking about shares & stocks and damn, I wish I payed attention to Dave Ramsay last year

5025 2018-02-24 01:32:14 And btw, the Dem controlled Washington state legislature just passed a ban on bump stocks. Gov Inslee will sign it. #Progressive #GunControlNow #bumpstocks
5026 2018-02-24 01:31:51 Most shooters don't give a crap about bump stocks but it is the principle of the matter. Democrats will never stop their march to outlaw any and all privately owned firearms. We won't give an inch to these bastards.

5027 2018-02-24 01:31:15 Age means nothing. Banning bump stocks will solve nothing. The emphasis needs to be on mental health and keeping firearms out of the hands of crazy people.
5028 2018-02-24 01:30:21 Yeah, taking kids off meds is really the solution. Also the amendment says "right to bear arms" it doesn't specify which arms and it certainly doesn't guarantee the right to bump stocks.
5029 2018-02-24 01:29:11 Bump stocks are a gimmick for the gun range that in no way changes the internal workings of a semiautomatic rifle. The ATF twice investigated under Obama and found them to be 100% legal under federal law.

5030 2018-02-24 01:29:08 Who owns stocks? Aliens? Do some research clowns
5031 2018-02-24 01:29:04 Have they really “ended their relationship” or just the discounts they offer NRA members? Kinda like tRump’s pledge to outlaw bump stocks, which sounds good but means nothing.
5032 2018-02-24 01:28:25 Hey, TT... there is NO best alternative to bump stocks and assault weapons.  Meanwhile picture an assault weapon ripping a child apart from limb to limb.  Tearing her guts out.  Leaving her on the pavement to die.  It is YOU who are in need of the facts.  Do some research.
5033 2018-02-24 01:28:09 So why not take out at least one delivery system when you can? Ie: Auto weapons and bump stocks.
5034 2018-02-24 01:27:56 That’s why we put it off until now. Give all the stores time to replenish their stocks after the holidays.
5035 2018-02-24 01:26:15 Hi mate- how do you access Indian stocks? Any recommended brokers?
5036 2018-02-24 01:25:58 We’ve pushed for gun control. Bush called it off. Then Obama enacted a law that made it harder for mentally unstable people to buy a gun then trump took that away. Now all he can do is ban bump stocks? That won’t do much. And he wants to arm teachers? Hell no.
5037 2018-02-24 01:25:57 @Stock_Phoenix 

Good morning Team
First a fall thank you very much for suggesting good stocks which could help in gaining money in market...hope to get the same kind of calls going forward
Need your help on few stocks which I will post in my next tweet just after this..
5038 2018-02-24 01:25:17 Of course it will! Not bring the victims back, no. But banning automatic weapons and bump stocks, hell yes!
5039 2018-02-24 01:23:20 Perfect tweet Representative Schiff!! If not willing to #BanAssaultWeapons, large capacity magazines, silencers & bump stocks they have blood on their hands! No reason for military weapons in a civilized society! #NeverAgain
5040 2018-02-24 01:22:59 I get stock queries. Please note that I would not answer any stock queries including the stocks I own. My portfolio has been shared in public domain. Don’t expect anything more.
5041 2018-02-24 01:22:26 Boss...idk what u trying to say eh...but I had nachos earlier today and some caramel popcorn so I good. Cyah deplete the stocks ...weekend just start
5042 2018-02-24 01:20:29 I’m probably going to start investing in my jobs stocks too.
5043 2018-02-24 01:19:35 Gosh you're dumb we don't want bump stocks it's a waste of ammo this is a problem the liberal mentality has caused it started when you tour the Ten Commandments off the wall where right and wrong came down from above for everyone to see not government but God.
5044 2018-02-24 01:19:13 Do not arm teachers in schools, 78 percent don’t want to be responsible having a gun in school. Go back to your original proposal of banning bump stocks and limiting availability of AR-15’s. Who needs an AR-15? Not the normal person and especially teachers. Stop NRA
5045 2018-02-24 01:16:41 Hey @CapitalOne : Want to keep my business? Then you need to stop doing business with people who sell assault rifles and bump stocks. Be socially responsible or I'll head somewhere else.
5046 2018-02-24 01:16:35 "So in between stocks you shouldn't smoke, cuz smoking is bad mmkay"
5047 2018-02-24 01:16:14 Awesome. Thanks for your hard work on this.  We need to force American companies to divest of funds that own gun stocks, and get banks to stop transacting gun sales.
5048 2018-02-24 01:16:12 @WhySharksMatter Is this the promotion of eating one of the most heavily fished and unsustainable fish stocks in the world?

5051 2018-02-24 01:15:11 If they were such obvious measures, why didn't the 100% dem controlled congress and White House change anything 2009-11? All Obama did was make bump stocks legal again, something even the NRA concedes shouldn't be on the streets

5054 2018-02-24 01:11:28 I have no problem with token changes like ban bump stocks, maybe an age change... but it MUST come with National Concealed Carry Reciprocity
5055 2018-02-24 01:10:49 Exactly! It all comes down to sensible stuff like:

• 10 round mag limit
• No bump stocks
• No armor-piercing rounds
• Federal background checks

Not that hard. Or at least it wouldn't be if there were fewer Sens and Reps like @marcorubio who took blood money from the @NRA!
5056 2018-02-24 01:10:47 Put them in wooden stocks and through rotten fruit  at them

5060 2018-02-24 01:09:03 Make sure if you own any of these Stocks, you call your broker first thing in the morning and sell them before they lose value
5061 2018-02-24 01:08:28 Bump stocks should not be legal.  There is zero need for them.    Not all weapons are semi auto. But most are these days. Much easier to hunt with a semi auto or A pump or bolt action.   All hand guns are semi auto.  Semi auto is not a bad word.
5062 2018-02-24 01:08:27 @/somestore said that they will open a go once they get new stocks.
5063 2018-02-24 01:07:59 They have message - stop associating with NRA who represents gun manufacturers. They are targeting politicians and corporate sponsors. Whether or not you agree with them - they got a lot done in a really short time (in addition to raising age to 21 and ban on bump stocks). Bravo!
5064 2018-02-24 01:07:44 They have message - stop associating with NRA who represents gun manufacturers. They are targeting politicians and corporate sponsors.

5065 2018-02-24 01:07:31 Sports and stocks what else
5066 2018-02-24 01:07:28 3.Eliminating the provision allowing legal firearms dealers to complete firearms sales after the mandatory three-day hold period, even if FBI has not responded to the background check.
4. Outlawing civilian purchase of bump stocks and high capacity bullet magazines.
5067 2018-02-24 01:06:54 Undoubtedly they see stocks as about the only protection for their money.
5068 2018-02-24 01:06:42 Investors bid up stocks to wrap up the week, with concerns over higher interest rates moving to the back burner.
5069 2018-02-24 01:06:37 It looks like bump stocks are going to become a thing of the past. They will never make guns illegal but they may change the age. I firmly believe the games and movies are as much to blame as the mental health. There is a middle ground but it will not happen sad
5070 2018-02-24 01:06:08 Sir, most Americans in the middle class aren't getting $1000. I got a $3 raise per month & my husband has no raise so far. We're don't have 401Ks & stocks, nor do we work for big corp like Apple or Walmart. I'm happy 4 those people who've rec'd this, but they're not the majority.
5071 2018-02-24 01:05:46 Shorting weak stocks in a strong market is expected to bare fruits in a weak or shaken market.

5074 2018-02-24 01:04:40 Are you telling me that every gun in the world is now semi-automatic?  Semi-auto weapons reload the chamber automatically every time a round is fired, that's why bump stocks work the way they do. Pump/bolt action weapons are not semi-auto, a bump stock won't make them full auto
5075 2018-02-24 01:03:53 Meanwhile...republicans scramble to buy up metal detector company stocks.
5076 2018-02-24 01:03:33 Yes.  Ban bump stocks that were made legal by ATF under Obamas watch in 2010.
5077 2018-02-24 01:03:27 Or they are owned by gun manufacturers who want you buying their products, go look at the stock market, the gun lobby loves dead kids, stocks go up.
5078 2018-02-24 01:03:22 Finally you tweet about something other than stocks
5079 2018-02-24 01:02:51 Yes. I said "stocks."
5080 2018-02-24 01:02:46 Di you remind a sstrange change before stocks swoom?
5081 2018-02-24 01:02:29 I support stronger gun laws more comprehensive background checks & bans on assault weapons bump stocks & silencers 4 civilians.But that does not mean I don’t support ur right 2 bear arms or am trying to take away ur 2nd amendment rights.We can have both & make this a safer place.
5082 2018-02-24 01:02:20 Bump fire stocks are for handicapped people. The ATF regulates them. In my opinion the Vegas shooter used them because his hand may have been arthritic or in less than good shape. He was old like me.
5083 2018-02-24 01:02:07 Arm the rest of the family, the family dog or cat, all relatives and all friends and neighbors. That should do it. Bump stocks for all!
5084 2018-02-24 01:01:46 Dropping to zero is a stretch but the same could happen to individual stocks.
5085 2018-02-24 01:01:42 Could use more restrictions tho who needs a gun that let's off 30 rounds. If you need a gun like that to "hunt" then that person sucks at itlol
5086 2018-02-24 01:00:45 Bump stocks - let’s have ATF look at that...again: Ryan to Trump #nprpolitics
5087 2018-02-24 01:00:31 You intentionally misstate the truth. What I want is no more semiautomatic guns, no more bump stocks. I want kids not going to school fearing for their lives.
5088 2018-02-24 00:59:55 Not using your business,ever, until you cut ties with NRA. Or do you like assault rifles, bump stocks and dead students? Sorry to be so harsh—but I stand with the kids. Do you? #BoycottNRA
5089 2018-02-24 00:59:23 They've been so recalcitrant that we haven't even been able to ban bump stocks, which is just freaking crazy. Automatic weapons are illegal, these should be too.
5090 2018-02-24 00:58:52 If your & the @NRA lobbying yields only a fix to NICS & given ample time for it to be in effect, when this fails, & it will, will you then see that better gun reform is needed?  Yeah, I already know the answer, but wanted to ask. Bump stocks & assault weapons yield bullet sales..
5091 2018-02-24 00:58:22 When I do rent, it won’t be with @hertz what’s your beef? You own stocks in Hertz
5092 2018-02-24 00:58:08 @scooter4 tell that to Stocktwits lol...I didn’t make the list I just picked ones out of their marijuana stocks list I wanted to DD
5093 2018-02-24 00:57:45 I like Warren Buffet's view of dividend paying common stocks as an "equity bond with an expanding coupon".
5094 2018-02-24 00:57:00 Some regulations are needed, I agree. Like I said before, the bump stocks ban is a great idea. However, AR-15s are no big deal for me. They are more of a long distance riffle. Handguns are more proficient at up close ranges. Gun knowledge & use are important.
5095 2018-02-24 00:57:00 Thanks for speaking up to ban assault weapons & bump stocks. You young people can change the world. Older folks have failed you all on this issue! God bless you & your Mom! Love you all!
5096 2018-02-24 00:56:58 Well I guess I should invest in stungun stocks in Florida.
5097 2018-02-24 00:56:54 Individual states can decide bump fire stocks and age requirements. I’m not sure about mental health. Secure the schools and streamline the background checks. Otherwise stay out of the fray. Scott is taking a lot of heat.
MAGA!
5098 2018-02-24 00:56:13 Wealthy people in real estate, stocks and business buy and hold. Same with Cryptocurrency. #bitcoin
5099 2018-02-24 00:55:51 I disagree, cash is not a hedge, it's a reduction of risk. If you are in a long term long position in strong stocks. Shorting weak stocks in an overall hedge is wise. Although I am a professional, so is this reply instantly invalid? I believe most that r agreeing, don't know how

5102 2018-02-24 00:55:16 Just learned that Kylie Jenner is the reason my stocks in Snapchat have gone down. And honestly? I’m pissed that I can say that sentence in truth.
5103 2018-02-24 00:55:05 No, the response to Vegas was about bump stocks, not the fact that a highly trained former government employee carried it out.

Find me 4 articles that focus on Paddock's employment history and not NRA/gambling, and I will say that I was wrong.
5104 2018-02-24 00:53:12 Don’t tell them but all the NRA has to do to change trump’s mind about outlawing bump-stocks is to tell him they’ll rename them “trump-stocks.”
5105 2018-02-24 00:52:32 I agree with teacher conceal carrying. That argument is not up for debate for me personally. Debate the argument all you want. I will agree to disagree with you on the topic. I think doing away with bump stocks is a great idea.

Me: ...may I see them?
Burry: no
5108 2018-02-24 00:51:55 Atta' boy, Freddy! Keep the faith and we will too. Fundamentals will win out in the end. Gold stocks are at the same level the S&P was in March of 2009. The S&P was beaten into submission then before rallying 4 fold.
5109 2018-02-24 00:51:23 @realDonaldTrump I agree though with ending the sales of bump stocks, and having more comprehensive background checks.
5110 2018-02-24 00:50:56 Banning all guns won't solve all things, but universal BG checks, mandatory waiting periods, and banning bump stocks will solve some things. Nice boogeyman you've created, though.
5111 2018-02-24 00:50:22 Did the NRA promote this idea to you? This would be more disastrous than a gunman alone!! All this would do is boost gun sales nation wide, and as far as gun sales are concerned, assault rifles and weapons, and bump stocks should be banned...period! Forget about age restrictions.
5112 2018-02-24 00:50:06 The NRA just sent me an email telling me to email Rick Scott to oppose the bans on bump-stocks and 18-21 year olds purchasing rifles. I totally agree, yet this whole thing started when the NRA said the ATF could ban bump-stocks. Maybe be more upfront with the public.
5113 2018-02-24 00:50:01 no one would buy a bond right now its tanking and stocks will follow
5114 2018-02-24 00:48:38 It's like my Vanguard Total Index fund manager isn't even thinking what he is doing when he doesn't pick stocks #gunstocks
5115 2018-02-24 00:48:01 70% of the population want assault weapons and bump stocks outlawed.  Don’t our children deserve that?
5116 2018-02-24 00:46:38 Bought 2 new AR’s, 2 bump stocks, and 1500 rounds of ammo this week. Also renewed the whole family’s NRA memberships. Eat shit liberal gun grabbers!!!!!!!
5117 2018-02-24 00:46:37 The bump stocks can be outlawed for being dangerous...they don’t have to be a weapon...lawn darts aren’t a weapon
5118 2018-02-24 00:45:22 I like gun stocks.
5119 2018-02-24 00:45:18 You are fools! Allowing assault weapons is unnecessary and, along with bump stocks, they should not be allowed except for military and police.  You are responsible for killing our children. Your funds bribe our elected officials.
5120 2018-02-24 00:45:08 He doesn’t intend to outlaw bump-stocks or order any change in gun laws. He’s a liar folks. What has he done about DACA? He says stuff then goes silent.
5121 2018-02-24 00:45:07 I'd love to trade bump stocks for silencers.
5122 2018-02-24 00:44:48 Problem is stocks is liquidity in options. More so in otm as well as deep itm. But yes, it should work in principle
5123 2018-02-24 00:44:41 Bogle: literally anyone can buy stocks
Lynch: just know about what you buy
Buffett: it’s so easy and just requires some patience and common sense 
Klarman: investing is the fucking hardest thing anyone could even think of doing and no one should ever try
5124 2018-02-24 00:44:27 @snason2013 Carter has used the fix ur stick for 2 goalie stocks this year.
5125 2018-02-24 00:44:23 The NRA had nothing to with the manufacturing of bump stocks in fact on at least 2 different occasions the NRA has called for the ATF to investigate if they comply with federal law,  and the Obama administration approved them.   You can look up this info.
5126 2018-02-24 00:43:56 The NRA is out of touch with reality as how could anyone be against Federal back ground checks for store,private sales or at gun shows. Bump stocks should not be allowed and sales should have severe consequences. Nobody needs fully automatic weapons.
5127 2018-02-24 00:43:43 Lots of noise and opinions out there today.

Let me just say that this is not a film I will use often. But I will most certainly give it a go, and THANK YOU for moving in this direction and bringing film stocks back.  
5128 2018-02-24 00:43:38 Shock horror Total Index funds hold stocks of gun makers. Shock horror they also hold stocks of everyone else
5129 2018-02-24 00:42:40 thank you hertz for using a national tragedy as a platform to advertise your company, smart time in history to use the deaths of children to raise your stocks #brilliant
5130 2018-02-24 00:41:57 keep up the great work! Remember, You guys give us reasons to not only get involved in stocks, but to trade the most highly risk filled stocks. You guys give us the confidence and guidance that we traders need. You can see this to be true from all the RTs you guys get.
5131 2018-02-24 00:40:49 Joe, load up on bump stocks, ammo, white sheets, & pointy hats, be happy!

5133 2018-02-24 00:39:55 If you sue of defund an corporative mind that creates the bull market again by providing another variable that makes it less linear stocks.
5134 2018-02-24 00:39:20 It’s important that we push for laws that ban bump stocks and AR-15s. Please for the love of God, ban AR-15s. No one wants to take your 2A rights. We just don’t want to see innocent lives taken because of this gun.
5135 2018-02-24 00:39:18 Wtfh Now Nra supporters are buying stocks??  We showed them what ones? Omg

5136 2018-02-24 00:39:16 So him trying to make bump stocks illegal and raise the age of buying guns is What? A bad thing?
5137 2018-02-24 00:39:00 This is what you're thinking about.....with all this Shit going on??!! Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?? Ban bump stocks.....up the age for buying guns to 21.....at least .....do the least you can do.....this is Not about you.....FOR ONCE @realDonaldTrump
5138 2018-02-24 00:38:22 This won’t work for mutual funds, just stocks.
5139 2018-02-24 00:37:35 $AKS nice pop AH lets see if we can close over 6 next week.
5140 2018-02-24 00:37:11 Vast majority of Vanguard funds are index funds that blindly replicate a specific index of equities. Pressuring Vanguard to cut gun stocks from their funds won’t work. It’s like criticizing Google for having the NRA site in search results. Try socially responsible funds instead.
5141 2018-02-24 00:36:42 Not sure but seems to be due for a big move soon $BIOC.
5142 2018-02-24 00:36:02 If 3.10-3.15 Monday I'll look to get in should at least get 3.5-4.00 soon
5143 2018-02-24 00:35:12 U think the other 99-98% feel left out? The nra’s policies are not far off from what the general population want. Ie ban bump stocks, increased punishment for gun crimes, and for current laws to be enforced better.
5144 2018-02-24 00:34:53 Sounds like a great way to make the same amount of money you can in stocks

However im striving for something grander than that. 35+ % ROI is the goal and in determined to keep hitting that goal. So far Clients are making that ROI plus extra and have for months consistently
5145 2018-02-24 00:34:52 Minus the raging over Mario today i played quite well again with 9th/46. Was able to tank my stocks quite effectively and got 2 clutch punch kills to win my sets. Still more flubbing again that I need to control and fix. Also my approaching was the best it's been so there's that
5146 2018-02-24 00:34:51 We don’t have to even rewrite it We simply write New Laws for more Background Checks & Ban Assault Weapons & Bump Stocks. Australia banned them years ago & they don’t have these mass murders anymore. When 2nd was Written the Founding Fathers only had Muskets. If they’d  No 2nd
5147 2018-02-24 00:34:43 Let these kids buy cigs & drink instead of bump-stocks
5148 2018-02-24 00:34:08 Really?  Having meetings with victims and police officers to talk about what could keep then safe isn't doing anything?  Banning bumb stocks and other mods to guns isn't doing anything?
5149 2018-02-24 00:33:18 Great, but bump stocks played no role in the Parkland shooting. Selling a military assault weapon to a 19 year old kid did.
5150 2018-02-24 00:33:12 Amazing to observe in person the #waleg debate ESB5992 - concerning trigger modification devices (ban on bump stocks in Washington State). The vote in third reading: passed; yeas, 56; nays, 41; absent, 0; excused, 1. #legislativesession2018 #GunLaws

5152 2018-02-24 00:31:29 The first 8 weeks it's an embryo. After that it's a fetus until it's able to live on its own outside the womb. Then, and only then should it be called a baby ("babe"). Bump stocks will be banned, as might be AR-15's and related weapons.
5153 2018-02-24 00:31:21 Haha ill try not to, but my stake in crypto is much smaller than stocks so if I do my life will continue.
5154 2018-02-24 00:30:26 Yeah I lost a lot last year following a person that shorts and buys put - everybody was saying WMT should have been good - 4 cents cost be $2300 - tried to scalp and stocks would be up 200 and 1 hr later 200 down . Crazy
5155 2018-02-24 00:30:08 i am looking for ways to eliminate less than ideal stocks, love this
5156 2018-02-24 00:29:21 Hi Karen, You are right; There are plenty of hard working Americans who can pay for their services.  Who are also supportive of their stand. Let’s watch those stocks rise!
5157 2018-02-24 00:28:14 When I was 19 I was on a nuclear submarine with nuclear weapons. The age thing I do not want. No bump stocks and mental health checks for all thank you.@ChrisDanielShow
5158 2018-02-24 00:27:27 Yes they do, and handguns as well without modifications like bump stocks.  the mods should be illegal, but banning ar15 specifically won't make much difference.  A .223 hunting rifle is essentially the same thing.
5159 2018-02-24 00:27:16 Hav a saying, The DOW and NAS go up big and suck the money out of the micro stocks.  Today...
5160 2018-02-24 00:27:07 And companies don't even use stocks to  raise capital right? Mostly they take on debt.
5161 2018-02-24 00:27:00 I'm leaving bright n early tomorrow morning
5162 2018-02-24 00:26:42 Since it is a pre-order so it is very likely. Unless jype mess with the stocks again
5163 2018-02-24 00:26:39 We didn't vote for Trump to take our right. If you give them bump stocks they will come after everything
5164 2018-02-24 00:26:37 for resell na but to rock of course
5165 2018-02-24 00:26:00 AK47 is an automatic weapon have been illegal for DECADES. An AR15 is semi-automatic. It’s like comparing a Mustang GT with a Mustang. They look the same. GT is ~450hp. Regular is ~300. A bullet from either gun can kill. Making semis automatic is illegal. Bump stocks sb illegal.
5166 2018-02-24 00:24:12 Time to start selling off @enterprisecares stocks and watch them tank!
5167 2018-02-24 00:24:04 What 8k are u talking about, papa?
5168 2018-02-24 00:23:52 The punchline of the bump-stock order is that the DOJ has already determined it can’t regulate bump stocks without congressional authorization
5169 2018-02-24 00:23:22 Are you looking at.the cannabis stocks in Canada
5170 2018-02-24 00:23:06 Wayne LaPierre is an American terrorist for pushing for weapons of mass destruction for civilians. There is NO rationale whatsoever for sales of AR-15s or bump stocks in our country. They are for mass killing!! It’s all about profits! #NRARussia

5173 2018-02-24 00:21:02 No more bump stocks :D
5174 2018-02-24 00:19:06 I’m against auto weapons, bump stocks, expanded cartridges.  I think most people are.

5180 2018-02-24 00:15:56 Why is the SEC asleep at the wheel? $RIOT should be halted immediately while they investigate. Why are stocks like this allowed to trade when there is OBVIOUSLY MASSIVE FRAUD taking place? Please do your job and protect investors (like Gartman ).
5181 2018-02-24 00:15:19 that's weird though
5182 2018-02-24 00:15:06 We named our firm Thunderstorm Capital because a thunderstorm is a frightening but temporary event... In constructing our portfolios, we try to invest in good companies whose stocks are depressed by frightening but temporary bad news. - John Dorfman
5183 2018-02-24 00:15:02 @LesterHoltNBC @HallieJackson Could you explain why you did not mention in MS Jackson's coverage that @realDonaldTrump was also proposing banning bump stocks and expanding background checks as enhanced gun control measures? Was it the hate you have for him? Really Unfortunate.
5184 2018-02-24 00:14:55 cause u had a 6min head start u didn't check in?
5185 2018-02-24 00:14:47 The difference with ARs vs other semiauto rifles is slim. ARs are more modifiable, I *think*, with bump stocks, etc, but I think that is the only difference.
5186 2018-02-24 00:14:42 The only thing that needs to be done is mental health registry nationally and end bump stocks. She doesn't have to be raised at all.
5187 2018-02-24 00:14:26 Really trying to resist swearing at people today.  First, arming teachers is insane. Second, Scot Peterson is not a coward, bit a scapegoat. Third, military grade weapons and bump stocks have no place in civil society. Fourth, "thou shalt not kill" is pretty straightforward.
5188 2018-02-24 00:14:15 With that said. The issue is if you allow detachable magazines it allows companies to make things like 100 round magazines. Those mixed with bump stocks became a mass shooters wet dream.
5189 2018-02-24 00:14:12 NEA memberships sky rocket. You’ll lose, you’ll get your bump stocks. Fixed!
5190 2018-02-24 00:13:44 Gun/NRA related stocks start tanking is when they'll start getting the message.
5191 2018-02-24 00:13:09 After a brief 1 week pause in the new rally, market looking ready to go higher next week. Time to start buying some bullish stocks #Rightsidetrading
5192 2018-02-24 00:12:51 Ban sale of assault weapons of war (ARs) and rounds of ammunition, bump stocks, 21 years old to purchase any firearm , background checks & waiting period to purchase - even at gun shows, mandatory training course and license. Limit ammo quantities.
5193 2018-02-24 00:12:10 Bioc what happened here
5194 2018-02-24 00:11:57 I think he's expecting a huge capital inflow in both stocks and bonds...
5195 2018-02-24 00:11:55 Want to change that without controversy? Make the stocks of the manufacturers plummet. You're on the right path. Investment funds have regulatory responsibilities to invest in high yields. They get sued if they don't meet that. Cause manufacturer stocks to fall? Done deal. Divest
5196 2018-02-24 00:11:20 Agreed. I’m pro-ban on high cap mags, pistol grips, and collapsible stocks (so “assault weapons”). I’m also pro-CCWP carrying in schools with proper qualification.
5197 2018-02-24 00:11:04 Describe “sensible gun laws”. I mean, in ADDITION to the hundreds we already have. This is just a chicken shit gun grab attempt by the left,who hijack EVERY tragedy and make it all about them!Ask Obama why he refused to sign the law NRA asked for, banning bump stocks!
5198 2018-02-24 00:10:48 Media loves tragedy. Trump is trying to fix things, the fact he is working on banning Bump stocks is a great step forward. To say games like GTA doesn't have a small influence on a kid's mind is ridiculous, but is definitely not a leading cause.

5200 2018-02-24 00:10:21 And of course "this government" aka Trump. His fault! When Obama, Bush, Clinton did absolutely nothing. Even Obama put legislation into action making it OK to own bump stocks.

5202 2018-02-24 00:09:07 Kylie Jenner made a sextape with snapchat and she fucked their stocks so hard
5203 2018-02-24 00:09:01 Trump is trying to ban bump-stocks. Ar-15 is not a military weapon. People in the military carry hand guns right?
5204 2018-02-24 00:08:35 @NRA loves when their stocks go up after a mass shooting 
5205 2018-02-24 00:06:59 The problem is that all too often politicians make lip service about laws after a shooting, but then figure they can just wait it out until people move on to other things, and nothing becomes law. Which is why bump stocks are still legal to buy.
5206 2018-02-24 00:06:32 Need to control black market sales of bump stocks also! Just because something gets banned does not mean criminals cannot buy it anymore! This will be tough but needs to be looked at too! Great job, Mr. President! We are behind you 110%!
5207 2018-02-24 00:04:43 i read several challengingly stupid things this week on why some gun owners feel emboldened by these moments. the fearmongering and illogical “rights” peddling has reached the point where it’s controversial to applaud a 14 year old demanding the ban of bump stocks. 

i am so sad.
5208 2018-02-24 00:04:15 all these mass shooting are done with semi autos AR-s and AK's...

Vegas guy had modified bump stocks on semi autos.

none of the mass shootings are being done with fully auto weapons. ...

that's why they want to ban em...

a semi auto can do a mass shooting , no problem...
5209 2018-02-24 00:04:15 BTW - If your investment fund holds gun stocks the aforementioned site also provides alternatives with less or even NO gun investments. But as always, talk to your fund... then move your #NRABloodMoney via manufacturers if so.
5210 2018-02-24 00:03:44 It takes your change and invests it in stocks
5211 2018-02-24 00:02:57 I agree. Guns have not changed, society has. But the left wants something to appease them, bump stocks might me it.
5212 2018-02-24 00:02:54 What gun control laws would you change? I understand the ban on bump-stocks. No one needs those
5213 2018-02-24 00:02:41 and increase background checks, change age requirements, extend waiting periods, ban bump stocks & make assault rifles & weapons of war illegal. 
Responsible, trained adults can still obtain a license & purchase a rifle or handgun. That preserves their 2nd Amendment Rights.
5214 2018-02-24 00:01:57 Are you this eager to talk about your ideas? 
Trolls aren't paid, we have our biases and opinions that grounded from information we gather

As for "gun bans", even Trump is talking about the ban of bump-stocks, completely moronic, cause anyone, ANYONE can make them
5215 2018-02-24 00:01:17 I tend to agree with part of your statement....the answer is not armed teachers. And then add in some common sense gun laws like getting rid of weapons that have no purpose than to kill humans quickly like AR-15, AK-47 etc & accessories like bump stocks and large capacity clips
5216 2018-02-24 00:01:14 Assault weapons ban, age to 21 to buy all guns, police officer at schools (Fed govt would need to pay for this--expensive), Bump stocks outlawed (with specific law, not a rule), loopholes on background checks closed (like buying guns at gun shows), Assault weapons buy back plan

5219 2018-02-23 23:58:26 Many of the stocks I’m dating have become very clingy, refusing to misbehave, but I’m not complaining. I’ll keep them around as long as they keep going up.

5222 2018-02-23 23:57:28 Like that action you took against bump stocks.....oh wait a minute
5223 2018-02-23 23:55:17 NRA only appears to stand for increasing gun sales. Do you own gun stocks?
5224 2018-02-23 23:54:22 As a British person I can confirm that we’ve all definitely been patiently waiting for you to ban bump stocks before successfully invading and re-imposing high taxes. Brave defenders of bump stocks are the only thing that have been stopping us these past 200+ years.
5225 2018-02-23 23:54:16 So after Las Vegas all his #LapDogs said "banning bump stocks was the beginning of a slippery slope towards taking away everyone's 2nd amendment rights and gun's"  Yet now after their Master Cheeto say's it, You all praise it as an answer to all the gun problems?
5226 2018-02-23 23:54:00 Maybe now would be a good time to ask (again) about bump stocks and enhanced background checks.
5227 2018-02-23 23:53:59 Your right if it's nipped at the bud and the background checks.  Fire arms waiting period and bump stocks and silencers prohibited. The limit on ammunition should be enough.  Or ban every assault rifle and be done with it.  The argument that they can use alternative weapons is
5228 2018-02-23 23:53:51 I say this as someone who values the #2A - there are certain things that need 2B accounted 4 in modern times the NRA PAC won't allow.
Bump stocks, limit capacity of ammo magazines, waiting periods, mandatory reporting of stolen guns, mandatory background checks all private sales
5229 2018-02-23 23:53:05 I have a old saddle rifle .44 mag lever action  10 rounds.
I have a 30-06 bolt action as well.

Being a disabled hunter semiautomatic is they way to go.
Anything that requires less movement means I may get the meat.

But no bump stocks or banana clips or hellfire triggers
5230 2018-02-23 23:52:10 Yeah, he isn't wrong, but most rifles don't have as large a magazine capacity.

Sort of like the bump stocks, I cannot for the life of me understand how the second amendment covers gun accessories, and why clip sizes or quick release clips can't be regulated out of existence.
5231 2018-02-23 23:52:08 If Trump gets his way and arms  40% of teachers with a $300 pistol (probably mfg by one of his cronies)+ bullets +(what would probably be NRA provided) training, this will = close to a $100,000,000 windfall for gun manufacturers.  Bump stocks are just the sacrificial lamb.
5232 2018-02-23 23:52:01 IMO he must think stocks are expensive/can't find anything he likes at attractive valuations
5233 2018-02-23 23:51:44 konni* and eat my ass
5234 2018-02-23 23:50:20 No law passed would have stop this
5235 2018-02-23 23:49:37 The debate about ownership has descended into hyperbole. No one has suggested that people (NRA or not) should not own guns, just that background checks be thorough and is there really a need for assault rifles or bump stocks.

5251 2018-02-23 23:52:01 IMO he must think stocks are expensive/can't find anything he likes at attractive valuations
5252 2018-02-23 23:51:44 konni* and eat my ass
5253 2018-02-23 23:50:20 No law passed would have stop this
5254 2018-02-23 23:49:37 The debate about ownership has descended into hyperbole. No one has suggested that people (NRA or not) should not own guns, just that background checks be thorough and is there really a need for assault rifles or bump stocks.
5255 2018-02-23 23:49:33 no, they make a semi-auto AK-47...I have one. 30 round clips.....mostly Chinese knockofss.

I also have a MAK-90 and SKS...versions of the AK..(only the stocks are different, essentially)

there are millions of them in pawn shops all across america.
5256 2018-02-23 23:49:11 Well I guess I'm keeping my Ford stocks
5257 2018-02-23 23:48:35 @realDonaldTrump do the right things: ban assault rifles, raise the age to 21 to buy guns, outlaw bump stocks, stop accepting $ from @NRA , don’t ask teachers to conceal carry, build safer schools, more money for LEOs. #BoycottNRA
5258 2018-02-23 23:47:52 Just had this conversation with my 18 yr old son. All this bs about banning bump stocks (a half a step in the right direction), is a distraction. We will not get substantive & lasting change until this admin & it’s sponsoring, greater evils are locked up.
5259 2018-02-23 23:47:42 Nice! My friend stocks up on whatever stuff I ask for when I go. She's got my healthy foods list down now. Their downstairs bar is open if I'm up for it. I was sick last time I dog sat though.
5260 2018-02-23 23:47:36 @Aaronitmar One thing I would recommend is having the game load up into tournament settings (2 stocks, 6-7 minutes, etc.) Other than that I love the modpack
5261 2018-02-23 23:47:04 that’s my point, they are exactly the same except on has wood stocks and the other plastic.
5262 2018-02-23 23:46:32 Won’t the bump stocks be able to be made by 3D printers?
5263 2018-02-23 23:46:22 Don’t worry - regional stocks held in Waterford afaik 
5264 2018-02-23 23:46:12 You can get a hundred round mag for an AR-15 and tools like bump stocks and trigger aids to massively upgrade your rate of fire and accuracy when going nigh-full auto. 

Have you ever shot a gun before? I grew up with 'em.
5265 2018-02-23 23:46:04 I’m a gun owner.  I have shotguns and handguns.  But I’m totally for bans on military style weapons and bump stocks. I’m also boycotting the @NRA and ANY company that supports them.  #BoycottNRA #BoycottNRASponsors
5266 2018-02-23 23:45:51 Yep no prizes for tiny incremental changes like bump stocks or age minimums... We need real reform.

5268 2018-02-23 23:44:56 @DavidMuir @ABC @jonkarl please stop allowing NRA & Trump set agenda. Out of 158 mass shootings in US, 21 were by shooters under 21. And 400k guns stolen each year! Raising purchase age not helpful. #AssaultWeaponsBan including large capacity magazines, silencers & bump stocks.
5269 2018-02-23 23:44:20 to remind stick with sectors or indexes with relative strength and stocks with relative strength..meaning imho would like the 50sma above the 200sma
5270 2018-02-23 23:44:06 That's great, and a good start, however bump stocks were not used in the Pakland shooting.
#ParklandStudents #Parkland #NeverAgain #MSDStrong
5271 2018-02-23 23:43:53 Bump stocks should be banned,  along with rapid fire guns!!!!
5272 2018-02-23 23:43:38 Who stocks that much peanut butter in Newcastle mate ..  
5273 2018-02-23 23:43:20 Trump is the only President taking gun violence in school seriously, he is the FIRST President to hold such listening & talking sessions with real victims & law enforcement agencies. His proposal is practical: raise gun ownership age, ban bump stocks, tighten background check...
5274 2018-02-23 23:42:54 You had eight years to do something.  You legalized bump stocks. You did nothing after newtown.  And now you say “we’ve been waiting for you?”   What the fuck. Great leadership.
5275 2018-02-23 23:41:58 Stocks #ALDUBSana
5276 2018-02-23 23:41:00 Aye, and the guy in the suit on the left has a fully automatic Mach 10 machine gun and it made no difference. Not a Glock 9mm like the teachers would have. Not going to be much of a match for an AR-15 with bump stocks.
5277 2018-02-23 23:40:53 making bump stocks illegal will end up in court because the stock is a passive device. The Pres can't make those stocks illegal by XO, has to be done by Congressional bill.

5280 2018-02-23 23:39:14 I guess you don't know that 95% of Vanguard Funds have no investment in Gun Stocks.  Since you are being tough on the gun industry and you have every right you went through a lot, why did you delete your tweets for over a year?
5281 2018-02-23 23:38:36 @davidhogg111 Sell all your stocks in guns and use the money to build you a safe space.#Snowflake
5282 2018-02-23 23:38:35 The goal is to outlaw bump stocks from being sold and NOT putting anyone out of business !
You'll still be able to get them in Mexico and other countries !
5283 2018-02-23 23:38:10 will pick some stocks from tech later...ndx pretty strong and is xlk...so will pick some of those later
5284 2018-02-23 23:37:57 Keep it up! The age limit is a ruse! Out of 158 mass shooters in US 21 of them by people under 21. And 400k guns are stolen every year! Must work for #AssaultWeaponsBan, ban large capacity magazines, ban bump stocks & silencers. That’s the only way for #NeverAgain @Emma4Change
5285 2018-02-23 23:37:12 You can enlist and handle way more dangerous weaponry at 18. Background checks are pretty useless imo. Bump stocks aren’t even close to the problem.
5286 2018-02-23 23:36:29 Well, look into what happened in the 1970s, because I think universities and pension funds were in the same situation. Perhaps they divested not just of S African stocks, but got out of the funds you're talking about where the stocks & %'s in those stocks is set by the index.
5287 2018-02-23 23:36:21 What do bump stocks have do with anything? Just stick to stuff that could make a difference
5288 2018-02-23 23:36:19 Stocks are the only thing people don't buy when they go on sale. They can't do it. They get too scared. Instead, many will sell at the lows which is the worst thing you can do. There are people still in all cash from 2008-2009. It's 10 years later.
5289 2018-02-23 23:35:02 Number of leading stocks today: 43 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
5290 2018-02-23 23:34:45 Trump made sessions back in December find a way to legally ban bump stocks, it's close to being on his desk. You have know idea what AR stands for much less why it should be banned. Bg
 Checks are already in place, and although it varies some. Most all states have mandatory wait.
5291 2018-02-23 23:34:43 We didn’t use “bump stocks” in the military. I believe I said that bump stocks allow them to fire like automatic weapons. You can search and show me where I was wrong. I’ll be more than happy to post a retraction.
5292 2018-02-23 23:34:01 Very true gun stocks always soar during these times, im buying myself
5293 2018-02-23 23:33:49 @SouthwestAir CEO Gary Kelly sold $1.6 million of company shares on Thursday, at $58.06. $LUV is down about 11 pct so far this year. #airlines #stocks
5294 2018-02-23 23:33:37 Claiming victory on gun reform by banning bump stocks is like claiming victory on car accidents by banning nitrous oxide. Don’t be stupid. The problem is much bigger.
5295 2018-02-23 23:32:39 I know what you're saying.  But as with S. African stocks in the 1970s, I think if investors apply enough pressure, mutual fund companies will figure out how to divest of gun stocks.
5296 2018-02-23 23:31:57 The DOJ has already determined that & has said the only way to ban bump stocks is with legislation through congress & signed by the president.

5298 2018-02-23 23:30:59 No private citizen living in the United States NEEDS to carry an AR15. In the military? Go for it. Lol it’s funny...because Im not for revoking ANYONE’s gun rights. But long guns, bump stocks, weapons of war, etc. shouldn’t be made so easily accessible.
5299 2018-02-23 23:30:56 lemme know about hay stocks ... i have too look no further than home when it comes to puking heifers from expansion like 4 yrs ago
5300 2018-02-23 23:30:38 Instead of banning bump stocks, we should be banning the FBI.
5301 2018-02-23 23:30:36 Aight let’s talk about the real world then: men wearing Birken stocks, go.
5302 2018-02-23 23:30:16 My guess is Donald Trump thinks you can buy bump stocks in stock exchange:-)

5304 2018-02-23 23:28:33 hm. i might need to see whether my costco stocks ‘em

our local one definitely does carry huge things of the vegetable naked juice but unsure whether that’s what you’re talking about (to be fair, that *is* a locally manufactured brand IIRC)
5305 2018-02-23 23:28:27 I agree.  Bump stocks have nothing to do with it.  It is just a buzz word being used by the uninformed to make something out of nothing.
5306 2018-02-23 23:27:41 I got in at .39 out .51 few weeks back. Been out of internet for a while see it's back in .3s. Back to Canada next week. Looking to load up.. Seems a lot of deals out there..CDN oil and gas stocks are either headed for bankruptcy or extremely cheap right now

5311 2018-02-23 23:26:24 Robin Hood crypto is the newest reason to buy the future $BTC $LTC $ETH and own twitter & apple stocks on the same profile
5312 2018-02-23 23:25:54 Considering their stocks rise everytime a shooting occurs, I'm gonna have to strongly disagree with you
5313 2018-02-23 23:24:26 You're the one who seems unwilling to deal with reality. Popular opinion is vastly in favor of gun-control measures like expanded background checks and banning bump stocks and assault weapons. How exactly are you proposing to save laws without these sorts of changes?
5314 2018-02-23 23:24:03 For a 10,000 dollar license and gobs of paperwork yes. Bump stocks, hate them. 3mr triggers, no use for it. Same for homemade guns. But you know why people push back on everything? Because they saw what progressives did with tobacco. Nibble, nibble until it's gone.
5315 2018-02-23 23:23:50 Friday fun fact: More WA legislators voted to ban access to legislative records than voted to ban bump stocks #waleg #TheLessYouKnow
5316 2018-02-23 23:23:12 There is no point banning bump stocks. Bump firing is a technique not an item. I can take 3 heavy rubber bands from trigger to mag well to produce the same fire rate or use my loop on my pants. Don't believe me search on YouTube, there are tons of vids.
5317 2018-02-23 23:23:01 @SenatorTimScott stop being a Republican and use your common sense. You know the right thing to do concerning assault rifles, bump stocks, and other murder devices. Don’t kow tow.
5318 2018-02-23 23:22:53 I'm all for stringent checks, and I mean bump stocks and things like that you don't need. I know this opinion isn't popular with other gun owners but something has to change I began h.s. right after Columbine, and that was an extremely frightening time
5319 2018-02-23 23:22:34 I don't pick stocks on Twitter. I teach people how to fish instead.
5320 2018-02-23 23:22:11 A one that tracks certain components of the market in this case small or med capitalization stocks so far from promoting gun companies just reflecting their share of the stock market. It's a passive inv so the % they invest is strictly calc based on the size of capitalization
5321 2018-02-23 23:21:57 Magazine size, bump stocks, and rifles that look scary can all be altered but it changes nothing. A fig leaf for politicians.
5322 2018-02-23 23:21:55 Save/ learn how to invest in to stocks etc. become business smart. 27k isnt cool you know whats cool? 27 million. Be aggressive in life and earn what you want. 
5323 2018-02-23 23:21:39 Emma! All of us 50 something women want to be you when we grow up!:) Stay strong & don’t compromise on the promise of banning assault weapons, large capacity magazines, bump stocks & silencers! We truly need #NeverAgain big love to you & your fellow classmates!
5324 2018-02-23 23:21:29 Boycott and dump their stocks!
5325 2018-02-23 23:21:18 Washington governor to sigh bill that passed both houses banning bump stocks.
5326 2018-02-23 23:20:57 So at 18 you can go die for your country but you can't protect yourself.
I don't  use for bump stocks but lots of law abiding citizens use them for entertainment no gun right or accessory should ever be banned.
You give an inch they'll take a mile
Go study history on gun control
5327 2018-02-23 23:19:44 the government fails lots of people and helps lots of people. that doesn't mean I should need to invest in gun stocks because so many 401k funds have them. if they want weapons, they should produce them
5328 2018-02-23 23:18:58 Must just be a coincidence. Nobody is manipulating prices. Unless the Swiss natnl bank high closes stocks... #rigged #CentralBanks
5329 2018-02-23 23:18:46 Bet but imma look into the steel stocks since my taxes going to that shit anyway might as well get a return back
5330 2018-02-23 23:18:43 People don't understand. Assault weapons have been banned for decades. The AR-15 is an assault weapon "style". It's a semi-aotomatic. Hence, bump stocks. 
Possibly separate semis from rifles/shotguns. Some families must hunt for their food.
5331 2018-02-23 23:18:30 Why do you care? are you making money from bump stocks?  what's in it for you? maybe think about your future children or grandchildren or somebody else's children Maybe
5332 2018-02-23 23:17:45 Hopefully, my stocks keep doing good, and I'll be able to go to community college to get the necessary classes out of the way. Math, civics, etc.
5333 2018-02-23 23:17:31 You obviously are interpreting the Investigation, solely with your preconceived ideas on its completion. If you think Rosenstein said this will end without involving any Americans, maybe you should buy Coal Company Stocks. This because, the President said Coal is coming back 
5334 2018-02-23 23:17:19 I'm against bump stocks SweetHeart....an accessory doesn't include the base model.
5335 2018-02-23 23:17:12 We're in Costa Rica now with limited internet access. I checked in today and none of my CDN oil stocks bids have filled!! Enjoy your vacay!!
5336 2018-02-23 23:16:58 I'm not.  But they're part of the problem.  I'm not talking about taking peoples guns.  Let's be smart about what we need to defend ourselves and who should be able to get one.  Bump stocks?  AR-15s??  Come on.  I know people that own those that have no business owning them.
5337 2018-02-23 23:16:12 Stackin my money investin in stocks
5338 2018-02-23 23:16:04 YAY! Twitter stocks fell 4 points since we conservatives got messed with Tuesday!!! #MAGA except I'm still locked
5339 2018-02-23 23:16:02 Don’t we need to try something, right? Leaving the door open as new technology is created, read bump stocks, isn’t working.
5340 2018-02-23 23:15:45 @BethDoglio thank you for voting today to ban bump stocks.
5341 2018-02-23 23:15:06 Again, a nonsensical argument.  Nothing in the 2nd amendment prevents: background checks (with no loopholes); licensing and registration requirements; clip size limitations; age restrictions; and banning bump stocks.
5342 2018-02-23 23:15:03 Well I know Obama allowed Bump Stocks and Bigger Magazines
He also took away the requirement that they be locked up in Cars or Trains  That Clinton instituted
5343 2018-02-23 23:14:41 @realDonaldTrump Your AG ENFORCES the law. He does not create them. If you want to ban bump stocks you will need to contact CONGRESS prior to putting those companies out of business. Just sayin.
5344 2018-02-23 23:14:36 And ask them to divest of those stocks. This was done in the 70s with South African stocks investments by universities & public employee retirement systems & had a big influence on the fall of apartheid, so David has a great idea.
5345 2018-02-23 23:14:26 Looks like Google 'jumped the shark' by getting rid of the view image button in the Images Search.  I predict Bing stocks to rise..lol! ;)
5346 2018-02-23 23:13:59 Hey y’all .. anybody remember Obama asking Congress to stop bump stocks.?no,me ether... watch closely now .. and you pledged this ... we have a real leader in president Trump... if gun control doesn’t have at least something small.. I’ll register a Democrat and vote party line
5347 2018-02-23 23:13:38 Mass Slaughter, the price of your freedom to own AR15 and Bump Stocks.  Definitely worth it!
5348 2018-02-23 23:13:25 Totally pathetic response. Allows bump stocks and for the first time gives them legal authorization. It doesn't strengthen background checks. It just adds penalties if federal agencies don't do background check reporting already required. Less than nothing?
#BanAssaultWeapons
5349 2018-02-23 23:13:04 Thanks. Is there anywhere in Sydney, Australia that stocks them? Would love to have a try.
5350 2018-02-23 23:13:01 I'm not a child, don't talk down to me as if I were one. It's not about what guns do the most damage, with 1 bullet, it's about bump stocks, & the amount of bullets ejected in a minute that arent needed in the civilian world. This isn't about glocks dessert eagles, or shotguns.
5351 2018-02-23 23:12:57 He literally stocks me too and I have never met the guy. I post a story and he’s always the first person to view it. I post a pic and he’s the first to like it  go away dude no one likes you. 

And Em, don’t even get me STARTED on your ex  lol
5352 2018-02-23 23:12:54 Yeah Kylie Jenner said she doesn’t like it anymore and their stocks dropped over a billion dollars lol they’re gonna have to if she leaves the platform
5353 2018-02-23 23:12:52 Youre so dramatic. You act like he's making teachers carry guns. It's a thought. You libs cry that he's doing nothing. Then when he suggests anything you hate the idea. He's banning bump stocks. Stricter backround checks. Among other things.
5354 2018-02-23 23:12:42 Kylie Jenner criticised the new Snapchat update and made their stocks drop by 1.3 billion I‘m SCREAMING
5355 2018-02-23 23:12:42 So many people are misinformed and don’t understand that without bump stocks, and guns with the capability of murdering dozens of people like in the Parkland and Las Vegas shootings in less than two minutes, a large majority of these shootings would not have happened
5356 2018-02-23 23:12:28 I read that a chimpanzee became the 22nd most successful money manager on Wall St after choosing stocks by throwing darts at a board of 133 tech companies. Maybe I should have that chimp manage my 401K.
5357 2018-02-23 23:12:14 I'm all for a blanket ban on assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity mags, actual background checks that work, closing the gun show loophole, expansive buy-back programs, etc. My problem is this law says "if you're rich, you can keep your guns. If you're poor you can't."
5358 2018-02-23 23:12:07 Well, there are 630,000 legal full auto weapons that are still in circulation. You have to register with ATF when purchasing, which some believe infringes on the #2A.

I could also legally own an untraceable AK-47 by going to a "build party". 

Also, bump stocks and 3M Triggers.
5359 2018-02-23 23:11:51 I am watching the news  Trump is talking about arming teachers then talking about banning bump stocks must file share pin in semi auto to make it fully auto wake up stupid or should I say trump And anybody else thinking like trump
5360 2018-02-23 23:11:33 When has the NRA ever cooled off. Two days after Vegas they were screaming about bump stocks like Christians scream about Jesus.
5361 2018-02-23 23:11:27 After $XIV incident, dare not hold $TQQQ too much, hard to find stocks to match the performance of $TQQQ.  Have to add some $SPY April call today to bet ATH before April OE.
5362 2018-02-23 23:10:46 i ain’t going lie once i hit my 2 years for them amazon stocks i might be out
5363 2018-02-23 23:10:24 That would be the moment I exit my oil stocks.
5364 2018-02-23 23:10:14 I believe he was using an AR-15, which is why the Democrats proposed banning it. The proposal was turned down, thankfully. Bump stocks are on the ban list, for obvious reasons. The rest is still pending.
5365 2018-02-23 23:10:13 Pleased to see #waleg pass the ban on bump stocks. It’s a small, common sense step to further prevent gun violence in our state, but we have a lot more to do.
5366 2018-02-23 23:10:11 The NRA pisses me off often and we do not see eye to eye on most fronts. However, i agree I could use assault riffles and bump stocks in a zombie apocalypse.
5367 2018-02-23 23:09:59 @TheDemocrats must realize the center wants #AssaultWeaponsBan along with bump stocks & large capacity magazines! You’re either in favor of saving kids’ lives or your not. You’re either serious about preventing mass murder or you’re not!
5368 2018-02-23 23:09:50 #TYTLive If Peterson commits suicide, these animals at CPAC will cheer while their stocks in automatic weapons go up. Trump would love to get teachers to become free security that's expendable-I'm sure the conservative police union would take that as a great deal.
5369 2018-02-23 23:09:36 If you ban bump stocks some other device will probably be created fairly soon that usually is, not that I'm four of them I'm just saying that's all
5370 2018-02-23 23:09:23 will go over some spx sectors with relatvie strength  and them some indidvidual stocks  in a bit
5371 2018-02-23 23:09:11 “I look at prices of US stocks & think, how much would I need to be paid to underwrite these prices. The answer is a hell of a lot. In fact an abnormally high amount”. Stephen Diggle.
Top quote! Great perspective on assessing risk.
5372 2018-02-23 23:07:41 @realDonaldTrump Those 17 murders were committed by a mentally ill person. The firearm is no different then any other semi auto. A bumpstock was not used. There are youtube videos of people who bumpfire without bump stocks. Metal detectors are the answer.
5373 2018-02-23 23:07:16 That's odd Tim, Cockermouth definitely looks like it still stocks a number of different Brew Dog beers. Was there a particular one you were looking for? Reid
5374 2018-02-23 23:06:58 #WALeg House just passed the bill to ban bump stocks.  It already passed the Senate.
5375 2018-02-23 23:06:53 So now it's basically Hertz, Alamo, Enterprise and National car rental agencies that will not rent cars to NRA members. Interesting to watch their stocks fall after this announcement.
5376 2018-02-23 23:06:22 .@RepLanceNJ7 - what about your call to ban bump stocks? And fund studies on gun violence? Why do you propose so little when the problem is so big?
5377 2018-02-23 23:06:17 I used to be a member of the NRA until it was taken over by a pack of raving lunatics.  I own 4 rifles, 6 shotguns and 3 handguns.  I also have a conceal carry permit.  I am a Vietnam Veteran and carried an M-16.  Bump stocks, high capacity magazines and AR-15s should be banned.
5378 2018-02-23 23:06:07 @jypnation @GOT7Official better prepare more stocks this time, cause ahgases are on fire 
5379 2018-02-23 23:06:05 Dump the bum bumpstock stocks.
5380 2018-02-23 23:05:59 It’s called impact or socially responsible investing. You can request certain  stocks not be in your portfolio but only with indiv sec. can’t do w m funds.  But there are funds that avoid certain sectors.
5381 2018-02-23 23:05:54 Next is all the Financial companies that invest in Gun stocks.
5382 2018-02-23 23:05:31 Mmmmmm facts. Cuz tech stocks not doing nothing
5383 2018-02-23 23:05:18 I don't understand why now are we worrying about bump stocks?  The comprehensive background checks are already in place, but I don't have a problem with being a little more strict in that capacity.   I don't really think that changing the buying age to 21 is going to matter.
5384 2018-02-23 23:05:00 We need to ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks; make it a crime to possess them in NY; and force current NY owners to turn them in. #BanAssaultWeapons
5385 2018-02-23 23:04:54 It really is sickening to me. It's animalistic. People would rather contribute to the ending of lives because they don't want to lose their rights. I don't see a single strong reason to keep bump stocks.
5386 2018-02-23 23:04:25 When a armed & trained deputy couldn't stop carnage then how would novice teachers with handguns will stop a shooter armed with rifles? @GOP Stop nonsense ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. regulate existing guns. Ban American Taliban @NRA. #GunReformNow.
5387 2018-02-23 23:04:23 ArmaLite Rifles only shoot when you pull the trigger too! ArmaLite rifle is lighter weight & more accurate too! Hell with bump stocks! Not having more advanced weapons are like saying we DON'T need internet, cellphones & electric cars too! Lets just stay in the 18th century then!
5388 2018-02-23 23:04:17 Come on Snapchat!! If y’all just change the settings back now this lil mistake won’t destroy your reputation..   The engineering and marketing department come on!!  Quit with all this prideful and stubborn shit!! Y’all stocks already dropped 7 percent.. Do the right thing!!
5389 2018-02-23 23:04:16 Weird how no one talks about banning handguns. Probably because it would be far more unpopular than starting with scary AR-15s.  Ban the scary things first like bump stocks, then make the argument for semi-auto to ban rifles, then use murder data to ban pistols, then nothing left
5390 2018-02-23 23:04:15 Rep. Deutch gives weekly Dem address; says the students in his district who attend Stoneman Douglas "demand action," and "it's time for Speaker Ryan to let the House vote" on background checks, banning assault weapons, outlawing bump stocks and other bills.
5391 2018-02-23 23:04:14 I expect an Executive Order determining that "bump stocks" allow the AR platform to become effectively automatic and therefore subject to regulation under NFA; I also suspect an originalist court would overturn it. But the lethality issue is a distraction IMO.
5392 2018-02-23 23:03:44 Devices like bump stocks have been around for a very long time people have always been trying to fire the guns faster and faster take a look at the TV show The Rifleman and opening scene
5393 2018-02-23 23:03:38 That is a chicken move.  Bye stocks.
5394 2018-02-23 23:03:36 True that I’m bout to invest into some weapon manufacturing stocks if they begin to arm teachers
5395 2018-02-23 23:03:33 Thanks @lauriejinkins2 for helping to guide WA House floor debate on ESB 5992, which prohibits bump stocks in WA. Respectfully fighting off bad amendments, and closing with an impassioned call to act, to do something. Bill passes 56-41.
5396 2018-02-23 23:03:31 Dear IRS:  Please collect all taxes due from @Alyssa_Milano please.  Money, assets, stocks, bonds, future earnings, don't matter how you get em.
5397 2018-02-23 23:03:21 Your right its a good time to buy gun stocks, your anti gun jig is going to sell millions more ARs and ammo and 30 rd mags. Maybe millions more than Obama did.  S&W Ruger thank you. !!!!!!
5398 2018-02-23 23:02:41 Bump stocks!?   essentially meaningless.  don't let them talk like this matters and cover it as an actual story.  do your job and push back on this BS
5399 2018-02-23 23:01:38 "the stocks in the indexes its clients invest in" and they're taking bt indexes like Vanguard Small-Cap Index (VSMAX) which is just a bundle of stocks of companies similar size and passive
5400 2018-02-23 23:01:35 Or just ask your Fidelity advisor not to invest your money in gun stocks until they cut all ties with gun makers -- Fidelity is one of the most honest companies out there-- be careful who you trust with your money.
5401 2018-02-23 23:01:22 Starting the weekend with back to back Marcella. 
5402 2018-02-23 23:00:31 Marijauna stocks went up 900 to 1000 percent . Now some i hold still up 400 to 500 percent and holding. Next leg up is coming.
5403 2018-02-23 23:00:25  I take you gave some SPYG stocks 
5404 2018-02-23 23:00:24 Watch what happens to these company stocks just saying
5405 2018-02-23 23:00:17 When pressed on the NRA's position on bump stocks, "The NRA is not going to call for anything to be banned"  - Dana Loesch
5406 2018-02-23 23:00:13 Why didn’t we think of this before?  Teachers with 9mm Glocks will definitely stop maniacs in bulletproof vests with AR-15s and bump stocks. #Trump #SchoolShooting
5407 2018-02-23 22:59:54 House votes to ban bump stocks 56-41 #waleg #bumpstocks
5408 2018-02-23 22:59:15 What flavour is the kool aid today? Toughen background checks that will still be a joke, get tough on mental health, he's actually rolled back Obama rules, ban bump stocks which weren't used on Florida and he could have done after Vegas. Prob won't do any of them anyway.
5409 2018-02-23 22:59:11 Or just ask your Fidelity advisor not to invest your money in gun stocks until they cut all ties with gun manufacturers -- Fidelity is one of the most honest companies out there-- be careful who you trust with your money.
5410 2018-02-23 22:59:04 As a ex business man, you should know that you need profit to give your employees a bonus and satisfied stocks holder. What’s your problem?
5411 2018-02-23 22:58:53 I know. There are investment companies that only do ethical investing. Stocks friendly to the environment, workers rights, etc.
5412 2018-02-23 22:58:13 1st let me commend your courage & perseverance, & also say how sorry I am for what has happened to you and the Parkland victims. Next, there are many fund families that do not invest in ATF stocks-some names: Domini, Ariel, Calvert/Eaton Vance, Pax World -vote with your wallet!
5413 2018-02-23 22:58:02 Is this his "art of the deal"? Ban bump stocks which aren't a big source of income for the NRA, and in its stead have teachers, school boards buy guns for the thousands of schools in the U.S.?!
5414 2018-02-23 22:56:55 @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP ARMING TEACHERS IS JUST PLAIN ASININE!!!!  THEY DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL TO DO THAT!! BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS!! BAN BUMP STOCKS! INCREASE SECURITY CHECKS!! BAN GUN SHOWS FROM SELLING GUNS!! DO SOMETHING BESIDES THE SAME OLD NOTHING!!
5415 2018-02-23 22:56:46 Yeah, we invested in oil stocks ‘cos we loved the tech behind it!
5416 2018-02-23 22:56:19 AK-47s aren't military grade. Agree we should ban bump stocks, which turns a gun or rifle into a machine gun, in effect. That would be somewhat easier to prevent a black market from forming. They are very unique and sizeable.
5417 2018-02-23 22:56:09 I’m all for guns but bump stocks should absolutely be banned
5418 2018-02-23 22:55:10 Looked at some charts last night and I am finally seeing some stocks starting to setup since the market correction... Got to keep paper trading my swing strategy until it's muscle memory. #stocks #trading #swingtrading
5419 2018-02-23 22:55:00 Nobody needs an AR 15, high capacity magazines or bump stocks. Ban these immediately.
5420 2018-02-23 22:54:29 Cool story, no bump stocks used in school shootings. Academic.
5421 2018-02-23 22:54:17 Lmao snapchat went down 8 percent in stocks cuz Kylie Jenner tweeted she done w snap
5422 2018-02-23 22:53:58 Ah, on the contrary. As they push less regulations, less laws; demand no regs be placed on accessories like bump stocks; not everyone is allowed to carry in the NRA headquarters; and that have very strict rules for their gun range - of which bumpstocks are not permitted.
5423 2018-02-23 22:53:43 Just ban the Bump Stocks and the Assault Riflestotally unneeded in society
5424 2018-02-23 22:53:24 New stocks
5425 2018-02-23 22:52:49 1. Instead of being 21 a shooter can stral a friend's dad's gun.
2. Bump stocks can be manufactured by anyone with an IQ of 100
3. This is a good idea if the officer is willing to die protecting students.
4. And, of course $50 million to line the pockets of the government.
5426 2018-02-23 22:51:14 Step 3: Protect
1. Prohibit the sale of bump stocks and other similar attachments 
2. Restrict the magazine size for guns with high caliber bullets
5427 2018-02-23 22:51:13 But Obama said it was not necessary to ban bump stocks.
5428 2018-02-23 22:50:21 Good lord, Shea, get a grip. Obama never came for your guns, nor will Trump. We can, however, stop selling and normalizing ridiculous things like bump stocks.
5429 2018-02-23 22:50:19 Yeah. In a self defense/home invasion situation I don’t like the disadvantage of them knowing the law only allows me 7 rounds. Bump stocks....I don’t care. Don’t own one. Never had an urge to buy one. Make them illegal.
5430 2018-02-23 22:50:13 A generally tough week for MJ stocks....today my list of 55 MJ's showed just 14 up and 36 down!  And I'm not sure there was a day this week there were more up than down actually as Wed. and Thurs. were about 2 up for every 3 down.  Hope we have a better week ahead!!  Cheers all
5431 2018-02-23 22:49:33 Right On Governor Kasich of Ohio!I The EliminationOf Bump Stocks & The Assault AR 15 Rifle Are Easy Hits For Trump!Just Do It!!I Also Like The RUMOR That Gov John Kasich Could Run As An Independent For President In 2020! You Have My Vote!Keep Me Posted !!
5432 2018-02-23 22:49:22 Well I think that’s a point that a lot of people aren’t addressing. The ability for the 15 to be so modifiable is why people are concerned with the fact that it’s been a favorite for mass shooters. Bump stocks, extended cartridges, and so on. It’s a very diverse weapon.
5433 2018-02-23 22:49:21 99% of people ask me if I’m involved “in weed stocks.” That’s not a good sign.
5434 2018-02-23 22:49:19 Well if they do pass I wouldn't worry at all, law abiding American here. Don't use bump stocks and I'm 30 so no big deal on the new measures being drafted
5435 2018-02-23 22:48:02 Thank you, Hertz.

The NRA can stand for gun owner rights while agreeing with reasonable restrictions.
Background checks
No bump stocks
No Military assault weapons
5436 2018-02-23 22:47:45 A cold snap on the way. They say. When do we start panicking about stocks of salt?
5437 2018-02-23 22:47:41 thx mark i have top short yndx..its very strange this market, they were saying 3 stocks account for HALF nasdaq gain?? so that means all other THOUSANDS stocks left behind, WOW ..i guess thats why noone talking about market, whether distrubution or not noone playin only big guys
5438 2018-02-23 22:47:33 I called today and had them pull me out of all gun stocks. Hit them where it hurts. They don’t care if we die. They care if they don’t make money.
5439 2018-02-23 22:47:27 That's a good excuse not to have a civilized discussion about improving gun laws. If they outlaw bump stocks the libtards will be at your door the next day to collect all your firearms....paranoid much?
5440 2018-02-23 22:47:09 All the young people that follow you.  Get them to get their parents to divest from any mutual fund that holds gun stocks and equities.
5441 2018-02-23 22:47:09 Does that include Melania’s parents...yeah, that’s what I thought!
5442 2018-02-23 22:46:55 Compared to the last dope we had as president at least he is doing something. If Obama hadn’t legalized bump stocks Vegas would not have been the tragedy it was.
5443 2018-02-23 22:45:44 Gotta own stocks...bought at right valuations.
5444 2018-02-23 22:45:21 Wealthfront has a tool, which Vanguard et al. need to emulate. "Settings" > “Restrictions.” In the box, type any ticker symbol, for any gun or other stocks you do not want Wealthfront to purchase. And thank you, so much, for your good work. I am so sorry about your classmates.
5445 2018-02-23 22:45:18 Like, banning ppl from buying an AR15 or bump stocks is probably a good idea, but its going to save like 100 ppls lives per year. I worry that its a distraction.
5446 2018-02-23 22:45:11 When responsible gun owners finally get together and decide to ban assault weapons, huge clips, bump stocks etc... then the debate will be over. It's time to decide if they want to live in a safe America or a war-zone.
5447 2018-02-23 22:45:01 That is why it's the most popular rifle in US, although the Mini 14 is also highly modifiable. Stocks, grips, optics, etc.
5448 2018-02-23 22:44:27 No doubt! Don't forget about those good percentages and stocks too!
5449 2018-02-23 22:43:33 This is academic. There is a reason the military doesn't just slap bump stocks on M4s. Hell, M4s aren't automatic. Its single or 3 round burst unless things have changed. Full auto is not very effective unless you have a larger weapon with bipod and large capacity 100rd+
5450 2018-02-23 22:43:30 CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME WHERE THE FUCK WALMART STOCKS THEIR DAMN KOOL AID FOR FUCK SAKE
5451 2018-02-23 22:43:15 I’m jus gonna set my 50$ aside for some stocks or somn 
5452 2018-02-23 22:43:11 PR and 8% on stocks, good day

5454 2018-02-23 22:42:55 Armed teachers ,armed security ,metal detectors and better mental illness detecting .A psychopath shouldn't have a gun .And don't forget banning bump stocks
5455 2018-02-23 22:42:28 And the bill to ban it would had went through if dems didnt bunch other stuff in it. Bump stocks dont kill people by the way
5456 2018-02-23 22:42:17 Will I still be able to buy bump stocks for my toy guns?
5457 2018-02-23 22:42:00 lol @Bettingbruiser saying I have a grade 10 education and call myself an investor, I never offer insight or DD and I think I am a pot stock expert?
I am not an investor, I am a day trader, I scan for hours and what I select is how I make money, and as for pot stocks 1/2
5458 2018-02-23 22:41:21 @KylieJenner so let me get this straight u send a tweet out about dropping snapchat cause u dont like its new interface or whatever n they lose 1 billion bucks in stocks. Like who died n made u queen of everything your word should carry as much weight as a goldfish
5459 2018-02-23 22:41:15 He’s going to ban bump stocks. Is he still your friend?  Or is HIS reform ok and everyone else’s not?
5460 2018-02-23 22:40:38 Yes, but assault rifles are still out there. That is the problem, ban the rifle or ban the bullets, the bump stocks is a minor component at this time.
5461 2018-02-23 22:40:11 I laud people for trying to get legislation passed on bump stocks, but I wonder how far we can really go? The ATF & Supreme Court already have agreed gun deaths aren’t enough to rule guns as illegal, and automatic weapons are legal with a $200 NFA Act tax & registration, as long
5462 2018-02-23 22:39:54 Investing in such funds gives the investors distance from specific stocks.  They make palatable the unpalatable.  I think any campaign against them ought to say just that.
5463 2018-02-23 22:39:49 Rifle purchases,  bump stocks,  and 150 round magazines right?
5464 2018-02-23 22:39:24 ~ 35 percent of US stock funds include investments in a maker or retailer of guns and ammunition, which adds up to more than $17 billion spread in } 2,000 funds, --from Goodbye Gun Stocks. The group also classifies retailers that sell firearms -- including Walmart-CBS Moneywatch
5465 2018-02-23 22:39:19 I don’t have the answer, I won’t even pretend to but, up the legal age to buy a weapon though, ban bumper stocks to make semi-automatic weapons automatic? Better trained guards perhaps jobless vets to fill that spot? Those are suggestions but, schools should be safe for all kids.
5466 2018-02-23 22:39:01 @blackrock @DLoesch I will be divesting all assets until your funds dump gun stocks. Any support of the NRA will not be allowed.

5468 2018-02-23 22:38:46 Bump Stocks & all Slide fire mechanisms are terrible ! I have tried using a few . But, it just doesn’t work with the mechanics of accurate shooting . Where training comes in too play , Moving targets & you yourself moving . Causes these devices to get in the way ! In my opinion
5469 2018-02-23 22:37:49 The DOW Jumped 347 points. Early retirement; HERE I COME! #Stocks&Bonds
5470 2018-02-23 22:37:49 How many shootings use bump stocks? One? It is a unreliable toy.
5471 2018-02-23 22:37:22 Now they’re going to hang their hat on bump stocks and pretend that will solve everything, aren’t they?
5472 2018-02-23 22:36:58 Good ideas, doesn’t go far enough. Ban new assault weapons AND make all existing ones illegal - turn in for compensation. Require licenses, insurance, eye tests to renew license, limit # guns per person, ban bump stocks & high capacity mags, universal BG Checks same in each state
5473 2018-02-23 22:36:54 If I can buy Mr. Bell a house I would , I really paid attention in his class when he talked about stocks I really emailed him after I graduated ... he’s such a nice person Ima shout him out when I’m RICH ASF
5474 2018-02-23 22:36:47 Each company has their own Funds that invest buy various stocks and bonds.
5475 2018-02-23 22:35:53 No, I’m laughing. Your logic-based ban (/s) to stop school shootings is to (as I said) ban guns *by name*, or if they have things like folding stocks. It would be a joke if not for the fact that anti-gun people such as yourself using dead kids to push an agenda.
5476 2018-02-23 22:35:29 Pay off college debt, buy a decent car and house pay those off, put half of the rest between savings and stocks or buy a business, give the remainder to a charity 
5477 2018-02-23 22:34:48 I have a high interest for stocks y’all don’t understand how much I love the shit & real estate !
5478 2018-02-23 22:34:30 They required other "acquired fund fees" like ETFs, mutual funds, expenses from shorting stocks, and even BDCs/PFICs to be included so excluding these swap fees is indeed puzzling.  But at the end of the day just look at net performance and make a determination, can't lie there.
5479 2018-02-23 22:34:16 Super companies likely already have some of your funds in US investments - Bonds, stocks & infrastructure. Investment managers hunt down investments they believe approp & invest without Gov involvement all the time. Turnbull is grandstanding, big noting himself to impress Trump
5480 2018-02-23 22:34:10 Kylie Jenner complains bout snapchat and it loses 1.3 BILLION in stocks. Over a million people sign a petition over their dislike of the design & snap still the same. change it back and accept the design is a failure. @snapchatsupport y’all ain’t here for the people.

5488 2018-02-23 22:32:20 Thoughts:  Many 18~20 yr old young women live alone. They should be able to purchase a handgun for protection.  Also, I have read that criminals can make bump-stocks on a 3D printer. Many things to figure out.
5489 2018-02-23 22:31:08 Bump stocks can be banned with a letter from the ATF. 18 year old women have a right to defend themselves. 20,000 gun laws on the books. If only prosecutors had a few more to ignore. All gun crimes should be prosecuted. Period... but they won’t be.
5490 2018-02-23 22:30:59 Trump's idea of the "gun debate" is to concede that bump stocks are dangerous, have many, many, many background checks, the best background checks ever, and to arm teachers.

He's a total moron.

5492 2018-02-23 22:29:10 @RepJesseYoung great floor speech on ESB 5992 (Bump-Fire Stock ban), he is correct. Banning a tool is a vote that accomplishing absolutely nothing. Criminals will not turn the bump-stocks in, criminals don't follow laws. #waleg #waelex
5493 2018-02-23 22:28:52 Funny ...I've never seen a baseball bat, knife, skillet, rolling pin OR car that can be modified with bump stocks or 100 round magazines to maximize it's speed and efficiency for killing it's "subjects"...but I will watch out for those.

5495 2018-02-23 22:28:44 When you buy a bond or stock, you're not "investing." You're just changing the form of your savings. You previously had savings in the form of money (claims on the gov or a bank) and now you have savings in the form of stocks/bonds (claim on some private business).
5496 2018-02-23 22:28:04 @realDonaldTrump  very disappointed that you are pushing for the banning of bump stocks. This is opening Pandora’s box and will be the cause of 2nd amendment fights that could ultimately cause the loss of life when gun rights are infringed upon more than that currently are.

5500 2018-02-23 22:27:21 just put your money into an index fund, picking stocks can be fun but it's a losing strategy
5501 2018-02-23 22:26:19 I’m not at all knowledgeable like you are but I do know these Guns even unmodified are capable of killing many people within minutes & it takes seconds to insert a second clip With Bump stocks they become a Machine Gun. With magazines with up to 50 rounds thats much destruction
5502 2018-02-23 22:26:17 @Vanguard_Group has mainly though not entirely index funds, which invest in the entire market or a particular part of the market.  @Fidelity has some index funds as well.  However, they could both sell the gun stocks in their actively managed funds.
5503 2018-02-23 22:26:16 @Scottrades Interested in HIP for video?  Volume climax maybe on Wed. First to run back to Feb 5 dump price. That might be the low these stocks end up all holding at. One to watch.  Your videos are great by the way.
5504 2018-02-23 22:26:06 As a very liberal Democrat, I can tell you that's not true.  Background checks (without loopholes), magazine capacity restrictions, licensing requirements, and banning bump stocks.  That's all I want.
5505 2018-02-23 22:25:52 Anyone know anything about the stocks in stores downtown Toronto?
5506 2018-02-23 22:25:20 If people didn't leave the NRA after they failed to support Philando Castile and after they waffled on bump stocks, I don't think they'll leave if their rewards programs are cancelled.
5507 2018-02-23 22:24:53 Banning bump stocks would be reasonable
5508 2018-02-23 22:23:56 Several amendments being heard on SB 5982, bump stock ban so far only one to pass allows a buy back program to get people who have turn in their bump stocks under new law some $$ back- vote on full bill to come #waleg

#BanAssaultWeapons 
Chuck..are you aware of the law that Rick Scott signed making it illegal to question current gun laws.
We need a simple ban on semi automatic rifles and bump stocks..it's simple.
5510 2018-02-23 22:23:43 the boy was crazy
the kids are lying
lets talk
oh maybe we'll restrict gun stocks
the school deputies are cowards

the real cowards are those that won't confront the truth staring us all in the face
5511 2018-02-23 22:23:37 Can we start limiting the murder of defenseless babes in the womb with the same vigor as defenseless babies at school. You budge on butchering babes in the womb and I will  budge on AK15's with bump stocks! Let's shake on it ok? @CNN @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump
5512 2018-02-23 22:22:55 Blaming bump stocks is not either
5513 2018-02-23 22:22:34 Not nasty, just true.
Teachers with military background and experience, not all teachers at random, would work as a deterrent. 
raise age limit to 21,  ban bump stocks and background checks to cover mental patients.
5514 2018-02-23 22:22:32 we can raise the required age to buy a gun to 21, we can perform more exstensive background checks, we can ban bump stocks sales, but the sad truth is that those who aim to hurt people will always find a way- unless we ban their weapon of choice completely.
5515 2018-02-23 22:22:16 Stocks up today: Dow up 347 to 25,310 Nasdaq up 127 to 7337, S&P to 2,747. All-Time high? Weibo up $5.03 to $139.74, Tencent, Facebook, Twitter, Alibaba up.

5517 2018-02-23 22:19:30 Look. I didn't know its this hard for people to understand this is about stocks. This is just how investors react to public companies  . Not really about the people using it.

5519 2018-02-23 22:18:47 Washington House debating ESB 5992 (Banning Bump-Fire Stocks), I don't like #2ndAmendment bills that look to un-arm law-abiding citizens. Are Bump-Fire Stocks part of 2nd Amendment? I am stuck on this one. I hate outlawing things. #waleg
5520 2018-02-23 22:18:37 Is it possible to have the NY retirement portfolio managers  sell stocks of companies that advertise or have partnerships with the NRA? Their risk profile just changed. At least have the conversation with their CIOs @NYSComptroller #SellTheStock

5523 2018-02-23 22:17:50 The constitution has been amended numerous times - it’s time the second amendment gets amended to ban bump stocks and military rifles and to raise the age limit on all other guns.
5524 2018-02-23 22:17:25 I don't believe we need to ban AR-15s We need to have bans on bump stocks and high quantity magazines We need tighter laws on background checks and ban selling guns without one even if it's a person2person sale We need universal health care that covers mental health. We need love
5525 2018-02-23 22:17:19 Such sinecures must not be spoiled by criticism by the unwashed masses on the internet.  Imagine, writing deliberately provocative columns and then having provoked people be upset!  Luckily, the NY Times stocks large quantities of smelling-salts....
5526 2018-02-23 22:17:17 Ban automatic weapons and bump stocks now!

5532 2018-02-23 22:15:07 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren
5533 2018-02-23 22:15:06 The NRA is a sick joke. They're gun control lite. The NRA have a history of backing gun control legislation. Such as the Brady Bill, the Fire Arms Act of 1934, and more recently the ban of bump stocks. Join the GOA (Gun Owners of America) instead.
5534 2018-02-23 22:14:40 The law may stop Trump from ordering 'bump stocks' out of business ,,DO IT AND THOSE WHO OPPOSE IT CAN BE DESIGNATED AS TRAITORS
5535 2018-02-23 22:14:36 Anti-Trump responses by stockholder held corps do what; cause stocks to go up, down/return? Who pays? Who loses? Who wins? Do fudiciaries lose jobs when related stocks tank?

5540 2018-02-23 22:12:31 Go slow on this. Increasing the age isn't right and isn't going to help. Bump stocks are an outlier, only involved once. Strengthen communication on background checks and end gun free zones.

5542 2018-02-23 22:11:49 This is definitely a start and all  US states  must follow suit as well as to go beyond and ban sales of automatic weapons & bump stocks ...

5555 2018-02-23 22:07:00 Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Make it illegal to sell any part for any weapon that makes it automatic. Ban large magazines except for explicitly licensed hunters for nuisance animals (wild boar etc). 21 to buy a gun. Stop taking money from the NRA for any reason.

5597 2018-02-23 21:56:50 So didn't Trump just call for a ban on bump stocks, raising the legal age to 21 and improving background checks? More than Obama did in 8 years. But it's trumps fault
5598 2018-02-23 21:56:15 Are you BANNING the manufacture and sale of bump stocks, or just REGULATING them?  Are you BANNING assault rifles?  Are you IN FAVOR OF mandatory waiting periods?

5599 2018-02-23 21:56:08 Literally go look at his twitter. He wants stricter background checks, a ban on bump stocks, and to raise the age limit of buying guns. Go inform yourself before blasting your ignorant comments on here
5600 2018-02-23 21:55:34 not best person to say but anything with implication of increased short term risk like new business starts or small business expansions. For individuals probably moving nearby into  w/ larger mortgage, renter → home owner, debt financed renovations, choosing stocks > bonds?
5601 2018-02-23 21:55:27 It was a bomb stock. Bump stocks really aren’t at all practical because they vastly reduce accuracy and control of the firearm. It only worked for the Vegas shooter because he was aiming at a large crowd.
5602 2018-02-23 21:55:19 @jamieoliver Great programme about sustainable fish stocks tonight but where can we get fresh herring these days as an alternative to cod, tuna, salmon etc.  Herring used to be in plentiful supply in the UK.
5603 2018-02-23 21:54:40 Signs that you and the NRA don't give a shit about children... when you refuse to ban military style weapons... high capacity magazines.... bump stocks... have your pistols and hunting rifles but there is no need for an AR-15 or AK-47 .. etc
5604 2018-02-23 21:54:26 Remember what happened to Target!  Good luck with your stocks bottoming out!

5608 2018-02-23 21:52:47 Here's a thought, maybe don't make military weapons with bump stocks available to teenagers.
5609 2018-02-23 21:52:37 @jaketapper didn’t the Las Vegas shooter have no blemishes in background check? No record? Some of the worlds craziest psychopaths are introspective and then explode. Bump stocks wouldn’t have stopped him completely either...
5610 2018-02-23 21:52:13 Living dangerously is when you allow your toilet paper stocks to go down to the last roll before buying a new package. 
5611 2018-02-23 21:51:50 #CPAC2018 
In his CPAC, self-aggrandizing speech today, Trump praised the economy but failed to mention the surge in Bump-Stocks.
5612 2018-02-23 21:51:43 I hope interprisecares LOOSE A WHOLE LOT OF RENTERS. OR MAYBE LOOSE ALL OF STOCKS! Better yet GO OUT OF BUSINESS
5613 2018-02-23 21:51:35 For example; 650 dead,  2,785 shooting incidents and 3,457 shooting victims in Chicago in 2017, none of which were AR 15s w bump stocks.
5614 2018-02-23 21:51:17 I like this logo. It makes me think it’s profitable because of the green arrow which also leads me to believe it has to do with stocks... question mark. Aim for the stars my boy 
5615 2018-02-23 21:51:00 Glad I closed the $FB shorting pos yesterday then load tons of $TWTR Anyways @facebook sucks, still haven't unlocked my account, I am not going to buy their stocks, looking forward to next opportunity for shorting $FB
5616 2018-02-23 21:50:52 Don’t know where you get your info Vegas shooter all weapons and accessories can all be purchased and are available to most citizens this includes the bump stocks and high capacity clips he was a collector and had enough money to do what he did which takes avg gun skills at best
5617 2018-02-23 21:50:42 This poll was taken right after a major correction (record Dow drop Feb 5th). All of the headlines were about stocks falling record numbers. If you're less wealthy (more common for Dems), the very recent news could be the source of the misunderstanding.
5618 2018-02-23 21:50:33 (2/2) 4) ban on private purchases of military-style assault rifles, 5) ban on bump stocks, 6) require background checks for private sales, INCLUDING gun shows, 7) develop nation-wide mental health assessment/treatment process
5619 2018-02-23 21:50:33 Agreed, hopefully it's well received and they include medium format stocks.

5623 2018-02-23 21:49:52 It seems like there is some movement towards banning bump stocks.  So we probably should move on from bump stocks.

5628 2018-02-23 21:48:00 Trump voters must be mad: Obamacare still exists, spending has increased, ban on bump stocks and an age limit raise for firearms forthcoming. And ZERO progress on the wall. It feels like Hillary was elected....
5629 2018-02-23 21:47:50 All these leftists working to get funds to divest of gun stocks, genius. Drives down share price, allowing them to be taken private, where they are unaccountable to outside investors.
5630 2018-02-23 21:47:43 Excellent news. Hold them to it however, beware the bait and switch. Remember the ban on assault rifles after Newtown and the ban on bump stocks after Vegas.

5632 2018-02-23 21:47:08 @svenben I aim for 5-7 stocks. That was a general range based on current positions.
5633 2018-02-23 21:46:37 The dude I work with will not quit talking about trading stocks.

It is seriously the most boring thing I've ever listened to
5634 2018-02-23 21:46:29 getting rid of bump stocks and binary triggers, basically anything that automates a human action in order to artificially speed up a firearm.
5635 2018-02-23 21:46:27 Bump stocks are not the problem
5636 2018-02-23 21:46:13 I’d like to find out, Don. Thanks for your service, but don’t threaten a woman & then try to lean on Nam. F you, Trump, & Ivanka. All trailer trash. You all are the laughing stocks of the US right now, & you’re all too stupid to even know it. Lmao!
5637 2018-02-23 21:46:12 b/c the Democrats “forced” the GOP to use reconciliation process to pass the tax bill (ie, in order to avoid the filibuster they had to keep bill budget issues-only) but still a very lame argument which ignores the fact that banning bump stocks would probably pass on a clean vote
5638 2018-02-23 21:46:08 The new @Snapchat is AWFUL. No wonder the stocks dropped today. @KylieJenner was right.
5639 2018-02-23 21:46:02 Yes, fully auto are banned until they use bump stocks to turn them fully auto.
5640 2018-02-23 21:45:54 Some millennials wouldn't have touched stocks if not for their app (myself included). Overall I like their business model but had higher hopes for it's, yet unrealized, potential for cypto.
5641 2018-02-23 21:45:45 Shoulder extensions for pistols, bump stocks, extended magazines non hunting rifles, easily modifiable weapons and things of that nature. They're unneeded imo.
5642 2018-02-23 21:45:34 Position sizing is everything, I rarely trade stocks but your advice would serve many FX traders well. Everybody wants to trade for a living but they want to do it by tommorow
5643 2018-02-23 21:45:30 Oil and gas not moving it around it's doing it's own thing right now seems 3.15 happy medium idiots still think all Nat gas but really more oil but Nat gas booms it will too
5644 2018-02-23 21:45:01 And Scott's proposals fall into the no-brainer category. 

Bump stocks? Should have been done the week after Vegas. 

21 vs. 18? How much of the general population even knew there were different ages for different weapons?

Mental Health? Three letters... ACA
5645 2018-02-23 21:44:53 You realize how inaccurate bumpfire stocks make a weapon right?

Inaccuracies are dangerous sure but in the hands of someone attempting to cause harm it's also a disadvantage.
5646 2018-02-23 21:44:53 All opposed to the NRA & the gun manufacturers they work for should check if their 401k invests in those gun stocks. Then change to something else if it does. @jonfavs @jonlovett @PodSaveAmerica
5647 2018-02-23 21:44:17 Okay 21 to purchase an ar-15 style rifle

5648 2018-02-23 21:43:57 Excellent news. Hold them to it however, beware the bait and switch. Remember the ban on assault rifles after Newtown and the ban on bump stocks after Vegas.
5649 2018-02-23 21:43:55 What is the purpose for banning bump stocks? The guns are still going to shoot either way....

5652 2018-02-23 21:42:53 You do realize you can bump fire any weapon without a bump stock right? Bump stocks don't actually do anything...they just hold the rifle
5653 2018-02-23 21:42:17 Really just went off yesterday
5654 2018-02-23 21:42:03 Stocks root readily under glass, I should like to ask your advice.
5655 2018-02-23 21:41:47 How do you propose specific legislation that would address banning bump stocks without banking lightweight triggers? Any legislation that encompasses so-called "rate-modifying objects" would also sweep up performance triggers and light triggers too as "rate-modifying".

5658 2018-02-23 21:41:34 In the long term stocks as a category are hugely less risk than bonds because they aren’t sterile. Historical returns demonstrate that abundantly if comparing rolling long term periods of varied length.
5659 2018-02-23 21:41:23 @Everytown Opposed to the NRA & the gun manufacturers they work for? Make sure you aren't investing in those gun stocks in your 401k.
5660 2018-02-23 21:41:16 I am sorry just seen that got more 3.15 and 3.06  holding
5661 2018-02-23 21:41:16 Since they’re not going anywhere no matter what fake agenda you and the world powers have, what difference does that make? Gun ownership will increase, not decrease so keep all these “incidents” coming. No need to change retirement stocks, guns are just fine.
5662 2018-02-23 21:41:11 I'm not an absolute gun enthusiast, I love hunting and target shooting but to me an AK 47 and an AR 15 look like assault rifles! Sorry if I offended you by not knowing the complete story! My point being banning bump stocks a waste of time!
5663 2018-02-23 21:40:50 Uhhhh what? Why are you not investing? Unless you're low middle class, you should have SOME bonds or stocks. Even then, the tax returns should still help.
5664 2018-02-23 21:40:49 Quite interesting the power even the stocks give the Kardashian brand
5665 2018-02-23 21:40:40 Yep. I personally don’t care about bump stocks & would give them up in a compromise. Bump stocks for silencers. Reciprocity? Cant trust some states. Silencers makes sense. Why intentionally handicap one of your primary senses when using something dangerous. Muffle the gun.

5669 2018-02-23 21:38:42 NRA and NRA controlled politicians have a lot of explaining to do. Letting an 18 yr old with clear mental problems purchase an AR-15. Bump stocks being used to kill ppl in Vegas. NRA is complicit if you just open your eyes
5670 2018-02-23 21:38:29 I own guns and bump stocks are just plain stupid. All it does is unload your gun at automatic levels without any reasonable expectation of accuracy. Great for drive bys, mass killings and getting rid of excess ammunition... completely frivolous bullshit!
5671 2018-02-23 21:38:15 It clearly says shall not be infringed.... infringe means anything to limit shall not means under no circumstances will you do that... bump stocks are a part of the gun if you limit that it's called infringement.
5672 2018-02-23 21:38:15 Way to play on liberal emotions Se @enterprisecares your not fighting against bump stocks or even semi auto weapons your fighting against the majority of Anericans who may not be members but are owners and will probably sign up now. #neverrentagain

5674 2018-02-23 21:36:57 Thinking about starting up an @OldTakesExposed for stocks
5675 2018-02-23 21:36:57 Unpopular take, but as a gun owner, I'm not opposed to stricter background checks or a ban on bump stocks.  But I still don't understand why we aren't chasing after the root cause.  The @NRA didn't cause this, and gun control only limits some risk.  We need to address the why.
5676 2018-02-23 21:36:53 I can't agree more with this comment. Why should he have to wait while you run an investigation into your issues of where your buying stocks from, you have his money contact @CanonUSA Get him the camera or give him his money back to go elsewhere.

5678 2018-02-23 21:36:02 This isn’t about parenting. I’m a teacher. The Las Vegas shooter was how old again? He legally amassed an arsenal & bump stocks that turned his guns automatic. 58 slaughtered. This is about angry men & guns. Period.
5679 2018-02-23 21:35:10 Obama allowed bump stocks , didn't raise legal ownership age with multiple shootings during his presidency . Trump gets elected goes right to gun control wtf ! @realDonaldTrump
5680 2018-02-23 21:34:12 What? @realDonaldTrump doesn't know what he's talking about. A deputy/guard will care less for a kid than a teacher? Regardless, point is these shooters have AR-15's bump stocks whatever. A teacher with a handgun is no match. More guns is not the answer!
5681 2018-02-23 21:33:23 Since @KylieJenner has so much power to devalue SC stocks demand they delete the update!
5682 2018-02-23 21:32:32 I think it’s possible to have the best of both worlds. Defend #2A while implementing better regulations surrounding gun control. 21+, thorough background checks, longer waiting times, banning ARs and bump stocks.  This is not violating anyone’s 2A rights 1/2

5685 2018-02-23 21:32:02 Yes, but it's a testament to the power of the voices of those teenagers that he's even doing THIS much.

Next up: banning bump stocks and extended magazines... then restoring the expired assault-weapons ban.

5688 2018-02-23 21:31:12 I think you have the wrong idea about bump stocks, because the media only gave you some of the story.  They are pretty worthless in practice.  Never used one, but I'm told they overheat easily and make the gun jam.  The guy in Florida didn't use one as far as I know.
5689 2018-02-23 21:30:19 The top five stocks that gained today were $HPE, $JWN, $AAP, $VRTX. and $MU.

5693 2018-02-23 21:28:43 Ha, I once owned stock in CORV, which went public with the first all-optical switching tech just before the Great Dotcom Bust of 2000 sent telco eq stocks down >90%  -- CORV fell from $90 to below $1.  They raised $1B in cash on zero sales... traded below book value for years.
5694 2018-02-23 21:28:28 Do the right thing good people: fight for a) reduction of magazines to a maximum of 15 rounds or less b) stop sales of bump stocks and other gadgets that turn guns into machine guns c) ban sale and resale on any level of assault weapons now d) require 10 day waiting period.

5696 2018-02-23 21:26:28 Bump stocks also increase rate of fire. Thank you, I'm glad we are eye to eye on at least one thing.
5697 2018-02-23 21:26:18 Keep working to ban large capacity magazines, bump stocks and to tighten the gun show loophole!!
5698 2018-02-23 21:25:55 ...give any thought to whether banning those items makes sense. Take the vaunted "1994 assault weapons ban" for instance. It banned stuff like "bayonet lugs" (not actual bayonets mind you) and adjustable stocks, even though these things do nothing to increase the gun's lethality.
5699 2018-02-23 21:25:44 And it's NOT rational to dismiss, 
more intense background checks
banning bump stocks,
banning under 21's buying guns
banning the private sales of guns.
NRA your denial that you need to seriously regulate type of guns sold, where there sold,to whom they sold is indefensible!!
5700 2018-02-23 21:25:28 He also went on about improving mental health and making bump stocks illegal, which is the appeasement coming from all @gop to try to shut down talk about automatic weapons. Rick Scott is no hero. He also is leaving it up to state reps, who won't do anything.
5701 2018-02-23 21:25:18 I want to know why Las Vegas HAPPENED. Make them tell us. Bump stocks don't matter. Criminals do crimes. Law-abiding citizens buy these then shelve them because they use too much ammo and quickly get boring. Can be 3-D printed. Silly, useless to ban them; only angers good people.
5702 2018-02-23 21:25:15 Yes, cet par.  Stocks up, bonds flattish net, demographics, discount rates all moving around to play into this which make "cet par" not always "cet par" :)
5703 2018-02-23 21:25:06 I was talking about the age raising & bump stocks. Obama didn’t bother with those. Plus the ban on Assualt Rifles has been waiting renewal since ‘04. Obama didn’t bat an eye at that either.

5705 2018-02-23 21:24:56 Seriously?
Have you ever shot a 9M or a .45?
Do you think you cant pin down someone who is shooting a .223? 
An AR is simply a pistol with a barrel on it. They have collapsible stocks and foregrips. They are not magic shields ya know.
5706 2018-02-23 21:24:48 >Ban the sale of bump-stocks
>Person buys 3D printer for less than few hundred dollars
>Prints his own bump-stocks from public domain designs

phew, the bump-stocks could have been everywhere if we didn't ban them
5707 2018-02-23 21:24:42 Start a short fund against companies they are morally opposed to, with goal 0 net exposure to ‘sin’ stocks. This is still hairy, but an action nonetheless
5708 2018-02-23 21:24:37 No assault weapons for civilians. Period. Non-negotiable. Don't let others chip away at your energy w/ negotiations on minor points e.g. bump stocks. The tactic will be to wear you down, make u choose between finals + the cause, between proms + the cause. Stay strong, young ones!
5709 2018-02-23 21:24:18 Funny that the media and people are focusing on the fact that Trump talked about arming teachers, and not about the fact that he said they’re getting rid of the bump stocks
5710 2018-02-23 21:24:11 Also (and most importantly??) 11 of 153 US mass shooters under 21! And 400k guns stolen each year! #BanAssaultWeapons include large capacity magazines & bump stocks!
5711 2018-02-23 21:23:24 Vegas was very recent and we still know almost nothing about the event. Bump stocks could be banned and they still may, but if Vegas was anything like Florida, there could be more obvious fixes. The NRA was against CDC research because it was not complete, non-partisan research.
5712 2018-02-23 21:23:10 I have a picture of them in stocks as well 
5713 2018-02-23 21:23:08 Alex I only care about your analysis being that you've crushed fantasy stocks every year. Buy sell or hold.
5714 2018-02-23 21:23:00 Thanks for the list of stocks to short!
5715 2018-02-23 21:22:49 I have found that AJ's approach of providing specific guidance on 10+ stocks pre-market gives me more confidence to enter trades. I like it!
5716 2018-02-23 21:22:47 Short gun stocks. If the money dries-up the guns stop being made.
5717 2018-02-23 21:22:45 Yeah pretty much. But the dem base isn’t asking their leaders to not work with Trump and the GOP on new gun regs. They’ll take what they can get. They might oppose stupid ideas like arming teachers, but they’ll back any gun regs like banning bump stocks.
5718 2018-02-23 21:21:55 Great day in the market. Interest rates went down. Stocks went up. Nice to see.

Anyone at Securities Exchange Commission looking at all of these public comments that cause stocks to change drastically-research those who make a lot of money on the stock as a result. 
When did they invest/short did they know comments were going to be made etc
5725 2018-02-23 21:20:23 No one is saying banning bump stocks alone will solve all mass shootings. Just a start at preventing some. True that mass shootings can happen without them. Let’s see what else can work such as expanding back checks & stripping 2A from the dangerous. Practical reforms do exist.
5726 2018-02-23 21:19:44 Anyways back to my boring life of trading stocks & doing accounting work 
5727 2018-02-23 21:19:18 US stocks surge on the final trading day of the week:

DOW30 ends the day +347.51 points (1.39%) at 25309.99
S&P500 ends +1.60% at 2747.33
NAS100 closes +1.77% at 7337.39
5728 2018-02-23 21:19:15 Gun-Maker Stocks Slump After Florida Imposes Age Restriction On Gun Purchases, Bans Bump Stocks (not to worry MS-13 will get them guns if they want them. MS-13's DOJ/FBI/ATF gun running supplier over the borders will help like in the past) #ArmingModerateRebelsLikeInSyria?
5729 2018-02-23 21:18:30 Happy Birthday @TheSharkDaymond 

Just signed up for the Daymond on demand. Choose me for your 30 min session. I want to help the average person invest in something whether it's in stocks, real estate, businesses, crypto or themselves #10x
5730 2018-02-23 21:18:26 Trump doesn't intend to do away with bump stocks. He will brag about position and then blame others.
5731 2018-02-23 21:18:23 I recommend that you return your #NRABloodMoney and do something to get assault style weapons and bump stocks of our streets.  Students and parents will feel much safer when that happens. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
5732 2018-02-23 21:18:22 #US stocks rallied, #Treasuries advanced and the #USD slipped as investors grew confident that the Jerome #Powell-led Federal Reserve won't rush to raise interest rates as the economy picks up steam!
5733 2018-02-23 21:18:16 It feels like the old days.  Stocks surge higher.   S&P rises 1.61%. Nasdaq does better at up 1.77%
It felt like a number of days in 2017 today.  The stocks surged in trading today. Bond yields fell.  Fed comments were status quo. At the end, Feds Williams did not scare the …
5734 2018-02-23 21:17:29 i support you when you business is going south. you lay us off. i stick by  your side when you go to prison and you cheat me out of 25,000 class a stocks and threaten my  life and to have my brother take me out...and put me out on the street to die.
5735 2018-02-23 21:17:28 Never traded American tickers before but now I am tempted to because Canadian market is so sh*tty at the moment. Does TD charge extra commission fees if you trade american stocks?
5736 2018-02-23 21:17:10 None taken. The laws need complete overhauling, AR's, automatics, bump stocks & military powered ammo must be outlawed & background checks much deeper. Gun laws should be the same nationwide & the penalties for breaking them should be toughened.  (1 of 2)
5737 2018-02-23 21:16:59 US stocks closed at the day's highs and higher on the week: $DJIA +348, $SPX +43
5738 2018-02-23 21:16:34 arming teachers and making bump stocks illegal. think he proposed banning silencers too. Do think putting more money in mental health is necessary.
5739 2018-02-23 21:16:19 No need for bump stocks, we agree. Magazine size is more complicated. Even when size is limited and larger ones are not available (what is legal and what is available are two entirely different things), the bad guys just carry a bunch of them. Takes half a second to change out.
5740 2018-02-23 21:16:17 Buying in front of Buffett telling CNBC audience that stocks are best vehicle for the long run (again)
5741 2018-02-23 21:16:14 US stocks closed at the day's highs and higher on the week: $DJIA +348, $SPX +43
5742 2018-02-23 21:16:00 Bump stocks do NOT make AR15’s automatic weapons. They simply exploit the gun’s semi-auto feature to make it rapid fire. Still the bumps should be banned.
And as far as accuracy goes, the bump stock altered gun is inherently less accurate due to its functionality.
5743 2018-02-23 21:15:59 And volumes are weak on most individual stocks
5744 2018-02-23 21:15:40 It's all rigged brotha!  Stocks Commodities etc.  There is no organic price movent. Just got to work with it.
5745 2018-02-23 21:15:28 Awesome RALLY in #Stocks to close out the week!!! Didn't want to tweet & jinx it until the session was complete... *As always, used puts & calls as well with my outrights to try & hedge while I rode the entire move higher today...! $NQ_F +1.79%! $NKD_F +1.50%! $ES_F +1.39%!
5746 2018-02-23 21:15:10 And don't get me started with the hypocrisy of the NRAs gun and their strict rules. Bumpstocks should not be illegal to acquire demands the NRA, but you cannot use bump stocks on their gun range. Why, are they not safe enough for the NRAs gun range? 
5747 2018-02-23 21:14:57 Actually Dave, they don't believe he did use the bump stocks because the rifles or rifle (I don't remember how many) that had them were jammed. The bump stock causes jamming and that's probably why no one has a problem with it being banned.
5748 2018-02-23 21:14:54 So your saying bump stocks killed these people? So if a man throws a pipe bomb into a crowd then we blame the pipe? Or a propane tank in a crowd we blame propane tank company? Or a Ford truck etc... Do you see how ridiculous this is It's not the weapon it's the person behind it
5749 2018-02-23 21:14:51 Children really need to count as high as possible which is why we need to keep the bump stocks legal. Count them bullets kids! Everyone can help load the magazine.
5750 2018-02-23 21:14:43 Ban on assault weapons
Ban on bump stocks
Proper check the person's history before they are eligable for a gun
5751 2018-02-23 21:14:19 It's somewhere in Matthew, next to passage of god bestowing bump stocks and extended clips in a country that does not yet exist.
5752 2018-02-23 21:14:17 Bump stocks don't do anything except make it more comfortable to shoot for long periods of time. That's all the do. And we already have background checks, and people can lie on a mental health check. I do think everyone should take a safety course though, I'll agree there
5753 2018-02-23 21:14:08 The things you want to blame PMB for are really more emotional than factual. He inherited a broken economy that needed political will to correct. We are slowly but steadily correcting it. Banks are now more willing to loan for agriculture. Our stocks are doing well.
5754 2018-02-23 21:13:43 High capacity stocks are next on his list...
5755 2018-02-23 21:13:37 most tech stocks back to ATHs....incredible
5756 2018-02-23 21:13:31 Why stop at 21? How about 95? And why stop at bump stocks? How about all rapid fire weapons of war?
5757 2018-02-23 21:13:20 Bump stocks are for people with more money than sense... It's nothing but a fantastic way to burn through several hundred dollars at the range
5758 2018-02-23 21:13:08 LV: Trump wants to ban bump stocks
VT: A person who has a conceal carry permit. The gun free zone sign didn’t work. 
Sutherland: It was stopped late because the NRA member wasn’t at the church. If somebody inside had a gun, it could’ve been stopped a lot sooner.
5759 2018-02-23 21:13:06 Last time I checked, gov Rick Scott is changing the laws on assault weapons and bumps stocks.  Teens got shit done in 1 week we all couldn't donin years and years.
5760 2018-02-23 21:12:27 No
It's easy 
Ban bump stocks
Ban assault weapons
And do proper checks before someone can buy a gun
So check their entire history
That would help
So the wrong person doesn't get a gun
5761 2018-02-23 21:12:10 Ban bump stocks as well as any and all assault weapons! Why does anyone need these weapons?
5762 2018-02-23 21:11:43 @MeghanMcCain saw you on @TheView yesterday. See the thing is there is a time to hear both sides of a debate. But this is not that time. From my understanding you actually agree with @JoyVBehar about raising the age restriction and limiting SOME AR, and banning bumb stocks.
5763 2018-02-23 21:11:31 if y'all think bump stocks should be illegal, wait till you find out about binary trigger systems
5764 2018-02-23 21:11:26 But bump stocks make semi auto into full auto and these can be made or bought legally, even semi auto shoot multiple shots per squeeze of the trigger, so teacher and multiple  students would still be dead before teacher accessed weapon.
5765 2018-02-23 21:11:23 So stocks up crypto up, hv a drink a/o party hard this weekend thanks my CNBC Future 17yo anchorman 
@rvc330 @StockCats @RudyHavenstein
5766 2018-02-23 21:10:55 LOL  we weren't discussing bump stocks-  spin spin spin
5767 2018-02-23 21:10:49 It's fucked up. Pot holes so bad in Michigan that Belle tire has been backed up for days now. And you know what sucks I can't buy any stocks 
5768 2018-02-23 21:10:46 Okay here are the companies that you should “SELL” there stocks.
If you own these funds, you are an investor in the major gunmakershttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/if-you-own-these-funds-you-are-an-investor-in-the-major-gunmakers.html #FloridaShooting
5769 2018-02-23 21:10:23 Do not ban bump stocks once we start cherry picking parts of the second amendment it will errode away. Dont compromise with 2a. I love yah anf think you are doing great but please dont head down this path. Armed teachers great idea
5770 2018-02-23 21:10:03 Great work kids! Definitely a step in the right direction. Now the feds must #BanAssaultWeapons All of them, bump stocks too
5771 2018-02-23 21:10:01 LV: Well then let's eliminate bump stocks.
VT: So what law just needed to be enforced to stop him?
Sutherland: It was stopped 27 people too late.
5772 2018-02-23 21:09:58 #BoycottNRA  divest from gun stocks
5773 2018-02-23 21:09:57 And I 100% agree about bump stocks, AW, mental health checks and background checks. It should not be easier to get a gun than a license or passport.
5774 2018-02-23 21:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
5775 2018-02-23 21:09:21 Will love to see your reaction when your stocks fall! Keep your socialist ways! I wont be doing business with you again!
5776 2018-02-23 21:08:15 Recession looms on the horizon, but keep touting how great it is that 60 stocks are in rarified air. @TheBubbleBubble
5777 2018-02-23 21:08:07 Again, you don't understand the purpose of the second ammenment.

But back to what you want. Didn't you or did you not say you wanted to ban semi-auto rifles? Also, other than bump stocks what would you like to ban?
5778 2018-02-23 21:08:03 I really need to go make sure that there aren't any gun stocks in my 401k. Anyone know how to do that?
5779 2018-02-23 21:07:51 Bitcoin Stocks Obrigado por seguir matheusfr13
5780 2018-02-23 21:07:41 Def. there should be certain safeguards for certain weapons. No bump stocks or mods allowed for those who aren’t properly trained etc…
5781 2018-02-23 21:07:40 I love and respect the job you are doing as president. I voted for you and probably will again. But please dont compromise the second amendment. Banning bump stocks or other rate of fire items can be interpreted in the future to include all semi autos and so on.
5782 2018-02-23 21:07:13 All that need be done is stop selling the Assault weapons, bump stocks, 100 round magazines, increase background checks, l
5783 2018-02-23 21:06:58 We do! But we also have AR 15s with bump stocks and other modifications that are consistently the go to weapons of mass murderers. And even if we’re not talking ban, what’s wrong with limiting access and background checks?
5784 2018-02-23 21:06:39 With semi-automatic tiki torches fitted with bump stocks wielded by #Russian backed #BikersForTrump riding flaming cross tricycles chanting “free Flynn”! #Whew
5785 2018-02-23 21:05:38 Ok banning bump stocks is fine.

5787 2018-02-23 21:05:25 @Snapchat you should look at your plunging stocks and see that this update was a terrible idea
5788 2018-02-23 21:05:18 Dow rallies 348 points. Nasdaq climbs nearly 2%. Stocks rise modestly on the week, their second up week in a row @CNNMoney
5789 2018-02-23 21:05:00 Do the right thing good people: fight for a) reduction of magazines to a maximum of 15 rounds or less b) stop sales of bump stocks and other gadgets that turn guns into machine guns c) ban sale and resale on any level of assault weapons now d) require 10 day waiting period.
5790 2018-02-23 21:04:35 I disagree. I don't think we should ban guns but we should ban bump stocks. Age limits could be raised to 21 instead of 18. More extensive background checks, mental health exams.
5791 2018-02-23 21:04:00 All that sounds great. Also, ban AR-15s. What's the point of banning bump stocks, if people can just go buy the real thing? It's not your job to hope, it's your job to get things done. Remember "Art Of The Deal?" What happened to that? Your negotiating skills really seem to suck.
5792 2018-02-23 21:03:52 Do the right thing good people: fight for a) reduction of magazines to a maximum of 15 rounds or less b) stop sales of bump stocks and other gadgets that turn guns into machine guns c) ban sale and resale on any level of assault weapons now d) require 10 day waiting period.
5793 2018-02-23 21:03:35 Time to buy more stocks 
5794 2018-02-23 21:03:24 ever since the fall of BaldCoin in the stocks, he hasnt been the same
5795 2018-02-23 21:03:15 How would you characterize Mr. Buffett repeatedly urging mom and pop investors to go all-in on stocks during his recent media appearances while he himself sits on the biggest pile of cash in Berkshire's history at $116 billion?
5796 2018-02-23 21:03:03 Wondering why stocks spiked this afternoon? Looks like the algos noticed the Dow and S&P pushing through their respective 50-dmas... $SPY $DIA
5797 2018-02-23 21:02:40 And tgat is why the NRA are against bans. They are aware of incremental bans and won't let the process begin. Bump stocks are useless crap, nobody really uses them. But that's why the NRA doesn't want them banned.
5798 2018-02-23 21:02:34 Because bump stocks aren’t guns, it’s an attachment
5799 2018-02-23 21:02:31 Any recommendations or advice on the volatility happening in the market #stocks #DowJones
5800 2018-02-23 21:02:30 Darn those bump stocks they’re just killing everyone? This guy goes to court for murder right? He says:  “Your honor, it was the bump stock that killed him.”
5801 2018-02-23 21:02:18 No, Trump is just a flip-flopping, cowardly shit.
Trump flips back to NOT banning bump stocks.
He removed sanctions on mentally ill being able to get guns.
NRA wants something for their $31million.
5802 2018-02-23 21:02:02 Yes to an extent. But I am really noticing an overall trend of the most talked about "Bullish" stocks on Twitter seem to end up significantly down within 2-4 weeks of the hype. It is only speculation at this point but its overwhelming speculation and observation
5803 2018-02-23 21:01:39 I actually don't think a ban would fix things. Banning peripherals like large magazines and bump stocks would help. Heavy restrictions on semi-auto riffles is also in order. Allowing the CDC to actually study the issue would give us a better idea of what isn't working.
5804 2018-02-23 21:01:10 AWB was debated in 2004. GOP decided not to renew.
AWB was reintroduced in 2013 after Sandy Hook. GOP blocked it.

Bump stocks was seen to be a problem in Vegas. NRA is against the government doing gun violence research.

5809 2018-02-23 21:00:40 Ban bumper stocks.
5810 2018-02-23 21:00:03 Keep guns in the news cycle. Thursday is 5 months since Vegas. Where are we with bump stocks? Ask Paul Ryan if enough time has passed. All anchors should do this
5811 2018-02-23 20:59:15 Y'avait pas une news au début d'année comme quoi les stocks seraient beaucoup fat ? :)
5812 2018-02-23 20:58:54 Kind of crappy last half of the week, I rolled from long to hedged to somewhat short. But really my individual stocks barely moved, but market moved up to hammer the hedges. So be it.
5813 2018-02-23 20:58:54 I think so, lot of nice looking stocks setting up.

Major Shift Warns of Further British Pound Weakness
DailyF…
5819 2018-02-23 20:57:28 #Dow up 300+ just before closing bell @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney #stocks
5820 2018-02-23 20:57:20 I wish the @NRA hadn't budged with automatics (which are included in the 2nd amendment), or now with bump stocks (pointless to ban, but banning it only gives ground).
We stick together because we are all under attack, so I'm still a member, but I just ask for a little more pluck!
5821 2018-02-23 20:57:19 Toronto police whining about funding issues and under staffing.  Well at least the shareholders of the big 5 LPs saw their stocks go up 5% so that makes this all worth it...
5822 2018-02-23 20:57:15 it’s a wheel of fortune with computer games, ‘sickos’ with mental illness, cowardly sheriffs, not enough guns, bump stocks, corrupt (and/or BAD) FBI and mainstream media - all in flashing lights. Who knows how to fix this problem 
5823 2018-02-23 20:56:48 I don’t see a need to have bump stocks and they aren’t firearms. I’m for banning them. Banning high capacity magazines won’t do a thing, it takes no time to change a mag.
5824 2018-02-23 20:55:56 I agree that the problem is a sin problem and that stems into mental health. that is the one  point that this points to primarily.  Bump stocks is good too. Need to really follow through with data base on mentally ill.  That is necessary to keep people safe.
5825 2018-02-23 20:55:46 $LDSR not looking good at EOD Not holding ON! Will see how it plays next week!
5826 2018-02-23 20:55:44 Even in these topsy turvy times, some stocks make me look at them and say - WOW
5827 2018-02-23 20:55:13 Warren Buffett is just another gung-ho optimist on US stocks who happens to be sitting on $100 billion in cash. Sounds legit.
5828 2018-02-23 20:55:07 Good point. The ATF has restricted authority to regulate accessories. Like bump stocks. Because the weapon itself has not been modified. But clearly the bump stock works to akin a full auto. These are the real issues I feel can reach bi partisan solution.
5829 2018-02-23 20:54:57 Those scary black guns with vertical stocks....
5830 2018-02-23 20:54:08 Kim Kardashian's Stocks From Kanye West Have Reportedly Earned Over $30,000
5831 2018-02-23 20:53:46 But some guns have wood stocks. So we have to chop down the trees anyway
5832 2018-02-23 20:53:40 I don’t personally know anyone on twitter talking about these stocks, so I’m not ruling anything out. However, how do you factor in the overall market correction, with weed and lithium particularly hit hard?
5833 2018-02-23 20:53:34 Hey @michaeljknowles how many Dems own financial stocks in AR’s, bump stocks, etc.? Sure would be curious to find out if Dems or CNN have something to financially gain through a sudden spike in the purchasing of AR’s or Bump Stocks, yet stand against 2nd Amendment rights.
5834 2018-02-23 20:53:33 And what would he have to grieve about personally? He rolled back some checks on mental health because the ACLU (backed by tons of liberals) said Obama’s law was prejudice. Obama was the one who approved the sale of bump stocks.
5835 2018-02-23 20:52:43 Harden schools, install metal detectors, arm teachers with prior military service. Pay attention to kids under psychological care or who are on psychotropic drugs or who have a history of violence & criminal records. Age 21 to buy AR-15 and outlaw bump stocks.
5836 2018-02-23 20:52:36 Except when it comes to plastic stocks and being 18. 

So full of shit.
5837 2018-02-23 20:52:15 The Vegas shooting. He used bump stocks…
5838 2018-02-23 20:51:50 This kind of hysteria led to the Salem witch trails. I feel like we're dealing with moral Puritans again. How long before someone ends up in the stocks? #botsareeverywhere

5843 2018-02-23 20:51:18 The @NRA DID NOT shoot up your school. They have actually for years called for tougher standards on background checks for people with mental issues and on bump stocks. Why don’t you direct your anger toward the person who shot and killed your classmates?  He’s the villain
5844 2018-02-23 20:51:14 No high capacity magazines or bump stocks. None of these things are what the concerts intended with the second amendment.
5845 2018-02-23 20:50:36 Bumpers are like bump stocks
5846 2018-02-23 20:49:53 How would you feel about more regulation or even a ban on bump stocks? (Again, total genuine question from someone who hasn’t ever shot a gun)
5847 2018-02-23 20:49:45 7% of snapchat stocks drop
5848 2018-02-23 20:47:59 Dow up 300 points with 15 minutes to the close of trade. What madness the pace of the recent rise in stock market indices. It is increasingly down to small number of mega USA stocks.
5849 2018-02-23 20:47:52 Always have.  See men and women like me are more aware of what happens when the  hits the fan.  When  uninformed began clambering for emotional fixes, they become laughing stocks to those of us who know.
5850 2018-02-23 20:47:45 A semi-auto. Like AR-15 has  max. effective rate of fire of 45 rounds per min., according to manual. "semi-auto" means you pull trigger for every shot. Most AR-15-type rifles sold w/30-round mag., its poss. to purch. Bump stocks &  mags w/more rounds.  Was being conserv.  lol
5851 2018-02-23 20:47:08 Federal Reserve warns stocks are a bubble. Public Reaction: BUY EVERYTHING
5852 2018-02-23 20:46:44 If Florida state government passes these laws, outlaw bump stocks, raise the age to purchase a gun to 21, and keep people with mental illness from buying a gun. It’s a step in the right direction. Increasing background checks would also be helpful#ItsTime #GunReformNow .
5853 2018-02-23 20:46:42 PETRÓLEO: Precios suben más de 1% con reducción de stocks globales
5854 2018-02-23 20:46:05 $TCON back to $3 this goes is what I’m expecting. Cancer stocks are gold at these levels with these kind of pipelines. Could be a 10x bagger
5855 2018-02-23 20:46:00 We will be happy to get over 25 and stabilize or grow. Who sold their stocks? It was rumored The RESISTANCE was going to dump stocks and cause a crash to hurt POTUS!! Did anyone look??
5856 2018-02-23 20:45:55 But, I believe the stocks is going to run big, hard, and fast once it's let go. I also want to see success for the patients...just remember who he is, then there are no surprises. You can read that yahoo article about how great he is if you need to get pumped up...lol
5857 2018-02-23 20:45:49 I assume you had been long stocks until late Jan 2018? You know how to make better analyses than the chart above and have a clear picture where we will be in a year from now (reading your comments I would guess much lower)?   Ok make your call and I will make mine and we will see
5858 2018-02-23 20:45:33 Put the prick in the stocks. Lashings, flogging, etc.
5859 2018-02-23 20:44:54 Trump says he’s interested in raising the legal purchase age, increasing background checks, banning bump stocks. If he does, that IS a start
5860 2018-02-23 20:44:47 @NYGovCuomo in-depth background checks, longer wait periods, BAN assault weapons - all weapons of war; automatic and semi-automatics, BAN high capacity magazines, BAN bump stocks
5861 2018-02-23 20:44:11 I don't think anybody's saying that, or very few people at any rate. Sensible gun ownership is the answer. And no weapons of war type guns or modifications/additions like bump stocks and high cap mags.
5862 2018-02-23 20:43:27 Rick Scott has come up with a plan. No bump stocks, raise the minimum age for purchase to 21, and station security experts to stand in school hallways and scream LOOK OUT!!! at regular intervals. The cost of the security experts will be covered by Mexico.
5863 2018-02-23 20:43:05 Self Note

Market indices rising are great if selling. However, when I'm buying, I prefer to see stock markets falling, so I can buy selected stocks cheaper. 

I choose temporarily to ignore the negative market drift down on my portfolio. I consider it a temporary phenomenon.
5864 2018-02-23 20:43:04 Agreed.  With the plan he proposes, every nut job runs out and stockpiles the to-be-banned weapons before any law goes into effect.  Sales of bump stocks skyrocketed at just the idea they might be banned after LV.  But a good first step if he pushes forward on these ideas.
5865 2018-02-23 20:42:39 Trump is actually trying to ban bump stocks. Never thought I'd see the day.
5866 2018-02-23 20:42:09 What we have to change is the institutionalized paranoia that has people running out to buy bump stocks and bigger weapons, to buy 3 years worth of ammo sales in 6 months every time LaPierre spouts a new set of lies to boost sales for his masters, the gun and ammo mfgs.
5867 2018-02-23 20:41:52 He sat in his car sat in his freaking car! Not a man, a coward!
5868 2018-02-23 20:41:51 Reason doesn’t work with Trump & company... he’d rather  arm  teachers with GUNS talking bump stocks now!!! How about #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #GunControlNow    that young man and the other shooters that kill in masses use assault rifles!! Hello
5869 2018-02-23 20:41:28 Chief one last question.. This seems a fantastic method for straddle writing.. Can this be used for individual stocks as well. Need a good amount of liquidity in the underlying right..
5870 2018-02-23 20:40:34 Well, you'll start laying off employees soon who will in turn Dis you for making bad policy decisions. Your companies outlook is not looking good.
And I'd bet that your company stocks will fall too.
5871 2018-02-23 20:40:31 @POTUS @PressSec @GenJohnKelly @HouseGOP @SenateGOP AS PREDICTED Trump diddles around with bandaids like mental health,bump stocks,and other issues already being addressed,while avoiding real problem like Assault Weapons and even avoiding age requirements NRA opposes,effing FRAUD
5872 2018-02-23 20:40:21 @Fidelity Is there an easy way for me to determine if any of my mutual funds contain gun industry or @NRA related stocks? #BoycottNRA #AssaultWeaponsBan #NeverAgain #MSDStrong
5873 2018-02-23 20:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
5874 2018-02-23 20:39:57 Said no one ever.
5875 2018-02-23 20:39:55 Market Mid-Day: MBS up 19bps; 10yr Treasury 2.88%; DOW +287; NASDAQ +116; and S&P 500 +38,  Stocks improved heading into afternoon.
5876 2018-02-23 20:39:52 America isn't going to "let you to keep" stocking up on bump stocks. So you should stock up now.
5877 2018-02-23 20:39:45 Nigeria as a whole is a joke to me. The more Mr. President talks, the more we are made laughing stocks internationally.
5878 2018-02-23 20:39:15 Be mindful of the subtle pumps that take place on Twitter by what looks to be quite trusted posters. Not going to name names but I have been paying close attention to since Xmas. Some of the biggest and most popular stocks over the last two months on Twitter are in the toilet
5879 2018-02-23 20:38:57 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
5880 2018-02-23 20:38:21 Safety-guards whit guns would be better but people trying to be productive is good and make plans about a better system.
(sees: people whit mental illness and bump-stocks)
This isn't the right way sir!
5881 2018-02-23 20:37:42 Spoos panic bidding even after another warning from the fed that stocks are a bubble. Love it.
5882 2018-02-23 20:37:35 Take AR15 off the streets, make them illegal along with bump stocks and make a background check and registering guns mandatory
5883 2018-02-23 20:37:34 You sound ridiculous!  Get rid of Bump stocks and make 21 the age one can purchase a gun!
5884 2018-02-23 20:37:09 Those all sound reasonable except for the "bump stocks". I doubt that if all were enacted it would have stopped any shooting.
5885 2018-02-23 20:36:55 So far all they want to give are Bump stocks.
5886 2018-02-23 20:36:19 that’s part of it. Let the stocks tank. it’s all about patience and playing long term. these moves make sense we need to stay abreast with their stocks and if a comeback seems possible at the right time then we invest early before the takeoff
5887 2018-02-23 20:36:17 Dear @FLGovScott ,

Criminals don't give a fvck about bump stocks, background checks, or age.

Sincerely, 
Every law abiding American

5894 2018-02-23 20:35:02 But isn't that the easiest thing to do? To pretend to care and do something? How many people will not die just because bump stocks or pistol grips or whatever get a ban? 2? 

Smokescreens.
5895 2018-02-23 20:35:01 It’s past time for Congress to take decisive action to ban high-capacity magazines, assault rifles, and bump stocks that are used to create machine guns. Enough is enough. I urge Congressional Republicans to work with us to get this done.
5896 2018-02-23 20:34:38 Percentage of stocks above 10 day moving average needs to top 85. Then we might see some  fireworks.
5897 2018-02-23 20:34:33 Mods I'm pretty dubious on, especially bump stocks. There's a reason automatic weapons are banned, and trollface circumventions don't endear anyone to me. A 5.56 semi can have a purpose for varmint shooting and home defence, plus target shooting. Spray'n'pray, not so much.
5898 2018-02-23 20:33:43 Laura shall heretofore be known as "bump stocks" because she is also easy to buy, and useful for ignoramuses to shoot off faster without thinking.
5899 2018-02-23 20:33:33 Apple stocks is about to suffer a huge drop as others rise. Consumers are more demanding.

5901 2018-02-23 20:33:24 stocks run on fear and greed-Lost a lot these days so I have only fear-
5902 2018-02-23 20:33:23 I agree. I was drawing a parallel between legal rights of bump stocks.
5903 2018-02-23 20:33:08 Except you left out the part about magazines etc. there’s more to the assault weapons ban than stocks and grips.
5904 2018-02-23 20:33:04 @FLGovScott Your gun control proposal is political and founded in ignorance. Any semi-auto can be bump fired without a bump stock. Bump stocks are a safety device, so you are making guns less safe. You can die for your country at 18, but apparently can't own any weapon. Classy!
5905 2018-02-23 20:32:20 sooo does anyone else short stocks anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad.--Kylie Jenner
5906 2018-02-23 20:32:12 Stocks, and crypto currency work the same pretty much it’s a risk.. random up’s and down’s scared money can’t make money ya know.
5907 2018-02-23 20:32:09 Right while it doubles, smaller cap silver stocks quintuple. I'm riding one I presented in my Mining Stock Journal at 8 cents in the Jan 19, 2017 that is now over 40 cents. Another I presented in early 2016 at 12 cents is now close to $2...
5908 2018-02-23 20:31:58 Oh and bump stocks are just plain silly. Would never put one on a weapon. Zero aiming / control.
5909 2018-02-23 20:31:55 Yep, I agree "He appeared to imply that a correlation between equities and the nascent digital asset was beginning to emerge"

#stocks #trading #money #investing
5911 2018-02-23 20:31:31 Yes! I do it's reasonable. Bump stocks turn a weapon from semiautomatic to full auto which is an extremely hard weapon to aquire legally. Possibly not a ban on bump stocks but similar regulation as full auto weapons.
5912 2018-02-23 20:31:24 @N3RDCAK3 @Secretweapon Very smart words but I don’t think he was talking about small-cap speculative stocks
5913 2018-02-23 20:31:18 As a gun owner I have no problem with strong background checks, bump stocks don't bother my gun ownership, and if they ban weapons of mass destruction it wouldn't touch me.  My gun is registered and I took a gun safety course.  Responsibility is on me, and that's as it should be
5914 2018-02-23 20:30:46 More buyers than sellers? Powell's statement was very risk supportive. Low wage inflation and the only overvaluations he saw were in commercial real estate i.e. NOT in stocks (cf Yellen's speech where both were included)
5915 2018-02-23 20:29:55 Trump on Thursday: We're going to be strong on background checks, raise the age limit, look at bump stocks
Trump Friday: Security guards don't love kids. Save money give the teachers guns

5919 2018-02-23 20:28:10 You’re right. Fuck the NRA and their plan to ban bump fire stocks. I’ll Vite against that.

5929 2018-02-23 20:26:13 Don't you just love it when people nitpick the semantics? Technically, the rifles used are semiautomatic, but they are modified, as with bump stocks like the Las Vegas shooter, to become essentially a full auto. Only in America do we debate letting people buy assault weapons.
5930 2018-02-23 20:26:05 ATF reviewed bump stocks and approved them in 2010, finding they did not amount to machine guns that are regulated under the National Firearms Act that dates to the 1930s.

5934 2018-02-23 20:25:43 Snapchat single handedly ruined snapchat’s stocks
5935 2018-02-23 20:25:24 Basically. It's also popular because it's low-recoil, switching calibers (to, say, .300 Blackout) is often as easy as switching upper receivers (and occasionally magazines); with all the accessories available (sights, stocks, etc.), it may as well be a tactical Barbie doll.
5936 2018-02-23 20:24:50 I still got old stocks certificates from 1999 I went to try and sell that shit the other day and the company went under

5938 2018-02-23 20:24:29 Raising the ownership age - I'm good with. Eliminating bump stocks - good with. Eliminating my right to own a gun for whatever legal reason I want is not OK.
5939 2018-02-23 20:24:22 So @KylieJenner tweets that she doesn't like snapchat and it looses $1.3 Billion in stocks? LMOA Anyway she was correct.. The last update sucks.
5940 2018-02-23 20:24:11 How are your rights being “eroded” or infringed by securing background checks, requiring mental health tests, and stopping the sale of bump stocks?
5941 2018-02-23 20:24:10 If Trump really loves the children, he’ll ban semiautomatic assault rifles and bump stocks as well as raise the legal age to purchase a rifle...let’s see who really loves the children.
5942 2018-02-23 20:23:58 All this bcuz we can't close a simple gun show loop hole or do away with bump stocks

5947 2018-02-23 20:23:06 I just dont get it ? Watched Pres Trump speech at CPAC.  What is in his proposals and beliefs that you dont like ?  Age 18 to 21 for long guns, Mental Health diagnosed, no guns, Bump Stocks banned, Schools guarded.  Our 2nd amendment is there for a REASON !!. #BoycottNRA
5948 2018-02-23 20:23:03 Raising the age to 21 to buy guns, banning bump stocks, baby steps in the right direction. Common sense. Now who other than our military actually need combat assault weapons. If you want to use those, enlist in the Military and serve your country. Get to use them to be a hero

5951 2018-02-23 20:21:38 Some ideas : Bump stocks backrohnd checks law enforcement doing their job, limits on weapons which can have high magazines . But gun violence  has decreased as gun ownership has increased . That is a fact . The issue I think is more cultural.
5952 2018-02-23 20:21:04 $NXTD do I need to buy one fucking share at a time w OTC stocks?
5953 2018-02-23 20:21:03 he could be tanking on purpose to buy back in and invest and possibly skyrocket. Gotta break it down a little bit more but it could a smart move. we need to buy stocks if he does!
5954 2018-02-23 20:20:15 You know what would really drive home the message? Not having to award more of these by banning AR-15 guns, bump stocks, and other weapons used to kill our children in their schools.
5955 2018-02-23 20:19:40 As a rational gun owner, bump stocks should NEVER have been legal, and back round checks should be horrifyingly thorough, going back in heritage like a hundred years for mental illnesses, not sure how much that'd help, but it seems right for me...
5956 2018-02-23 20:19:16 For commodity stocks some experts care more about the technical risks than the political risk of the jurisdiction. For me it’s the opposite. I categorically shun exposure to markets like Congo or Peru, Bolivia. 

Congo for ex -  demonstrates policy disasters in the making ‘live’.
5957 2018-02-23 20:18:58 They support the ban of bumps stocks. I cant agree with that & don't like many of the restrictions already on the #2A. The #Commies have proven they wont stop until the #2A is removed, they just do it little by little.
5958 2018-02-23 20:18:52 Some idiot just sold $SRMX at .007 and the bid was at .0074. If this was you please smack yourself and realize you should never trade stocks again.

5960 2018-02-23 20:18:40 Also, wir fassen zusammen: Unter Obama wurden Bump Stocks legalisiert und die Republikaner wollten dies schon letztes Jahr, Trump jetzt auch, rückgängig machen. Derweil werden deswegen so viele Bump Stocks verkauft, daß die Hersteller mit der Produktion kaum nachkommen.
5961 2018-02-23 20:18:24 Dishonest bullshit from Rubio here. Bump stocks are totally legal right now. They allowed the Vegas shooter to fire 90 rounds in 10 seconds. The same fire rate as many automatics. Our laws allow this. Change them
5962 2018-02-23 20:18:09 country to invest in things like other business’, jobs, stocks’ etc. And Trump knows that. And other business people know Trump knows that, that’s why the stock market has been doing so well since he was elected. They don’t have to be worried about more sanctions and regulations.
5963 2018-02-23 20:17:52 These facts please people who own private prison stocks. (This thought brought to you by the letter "P")
5964 2018-02-23 20:17:48 We want those who are freely attending school and concerts and movies to feel safe doing so. The right to own an assault rifle threatens the rights of others for security and life itself.  #start somewhere.  Ban assault rifles and bump stocks.
5965 2018-02-23 20:17:16 I just dont get it ? Watched Pres Trump speech at CPAC.  What is in his proposals and beliefs that you dont like ?  Age 18 to 21 for long guns, Mental Health diagnosed, no guns, Bump Stocks banned, Schools guarded.  Our 2nd amendment is there for a REASON !! #BoycottNRA
5966 2018-02-23 20:16:55 I’ve always been fine with anyone owning a gun for hunting and protection but I can’t justify bump stocks and assault rifles.  It’s just not okay to own a machine gun for your home.
5967 2018-02-23 20:16:30 Crookedness in the White House. Profits over people. Ability to buyback and sell own stocks. Millions in tax cuts.
5968 2018-02-23 20:16:23 The whole point of the AR-15 is it’s a non-military version of the M4, so it’s only semi-auto. If you allow for bump-stocks it’s no different than being able to purchase a military issue Colt M4. From there you can justify pretty much anything. Disgusting.
5969 2018-02-23 20:15:39 Thank you Sandro. I have been holding all these stocks too.
5970 2018-02-23 20:15:28 Please give me documentation on that! Obama approved bump stocks! Trump has not done anything on our 2A rites while he has been in office.
5971 2018-02-23 20:15:18 Anyone that thinks stocks are selling off needs to rethink their time horizon
5972 2018-02-23 20:15:17 Bump stocks are not regulated by ATF.  They are considered accessories.  Wonder if someone coached Potus on which firearms are not regulated and that’s why he is willing to go on record saying he will put bump stocks out of business! Ya think???
5973 2018-02-23 20:15:16 “Hope you all have big stomachs,” USDA jokes when referring to high product stocks.
5974 2018-02-23 20:15:14 Only invest into stocks & patterns you understand. It’s so easy to get caught up in what other people are trading for different reasons.
5975 2018-02-23 20:14:49 Raising the age limit and eliminating bump stocks are the very least Rubio and his ilk can do....more is needed
5976 2018-02-23 20:14:40 Worst business move ever! Time for stocks to crash.

5978 2018-02-23 20:14:19 Necessary but nowhere near sufficient — only 4% of public mass shootings in last 30 years involved bump stocks or assault weapons purchased by someone under 21. This will not prevent 96% of events — hardly a beginning
5979 2018-02-23 20:14:17 The NRA supports many of these measures and have been for banning bump stocks for a while. They are not for the 21 age limit tho. Everything else is what they've been saying.
5980 2018-02-23 20:13:52 I’m sorry but children are getting murdered.  I’m not even anti-gun.  But the way the @NRA continues to back the use of ar-15s and other assault rifles and bump stocks it’s not okay with me.

5983 2018-02-23 20:12:47 Didn't work because there were already so many in circulation and the ban didn't include turning those in. Ban also didn't include sale of bump stocks or paraphernalia to modify other guns.
5984 2018-02-23 20:12:46 2) ok, but bump stocks had zero to do with the recent incident
3) is well intentioned, but just look at current case where the system totally failed. What good is this measure if no one takes it to court, like in the shooter's case?
4 Not foolproof. Can't be everywhere at once.
5985 2018-02-23 20:12:11 The 2A does not mean any gun, anywhere, any time. NRA must stop protecting rifles designed to leave no survivors, large magazines, automating accessories like bump stocks. #BoycottNRAElite #boycottnra

5988 2018-02-23 20:11:27 Exact opposite. TZero has a digital locate receipt platform used to match stock inventory with people who want to short stocks. Eliminates naked shorting, and fraud. Study more.

5990 2018-02-23 20:10:02 A lot of people failed them, including the NRA. Ban bump stocks? NRA says no. Increase age to 21 to buy AR15? NRA says no. Close gun show loophole on background checks? NRA says no. Do anything to prevent anyone from buy an AR15? NRA says no.
5991 2018-02-23 20:09:50 2) I don’t belive in banning guns. That is a very short sighted solution. I do however because there should be tighter regulations. Stronger mental health and background checks and a ban on bump stocks is a great step forward. I’m wondering if you agree?

5993 2018-02-23 20:08:53 I am starting to feel a bit weird, to say the least... So, not even 2 days ago highs and #VIx already 16.60? Again, its not a bullish behaviour. Oh, did i mention same old 5/6 stocks leading the way? #SPX #ES_F
5994 2018-02-23 20:08:44 Ohhhhh. I thought you said you trained the security guard. Lol! Thought 1 was I...feeling under the weather today so I am going to blame it on that. But this avoids the most important point. Teachers want to teach, not be soldiers. Don’t ban all guns but ban AK-15 and bump stocks
5995 2018-02-23 20:07:58 No we need what you are to afraid to do b a real leader and show these children today you have the guts to ban assault weapons ,close background loopholes ban bump stocks etc, or continue to show how weak u are & owned by NRA .
5996 2018-02-23 20:07:50 Just check and Softbank either buys out companies or buys share in non publically listed ones, assuiming they try to avoid any volatility from at equity valuation of publically traded stocks
5997 2018-02-23 20:07:44 Donte they’re not gonna ban guns and I guarantee you people are out right now buying ARs and ordering bump stocks. Or stocking up on even more powerful weapons. Efforts designed to get rid of guns will fail.

6002 2018-02-23 20:06:28 Yes, it is true that one is not permitted to take weapons into NRAs headquarters. Their gun range is wholly separate AND, has insane rules - one of which, bump stocks are not permitted on their gun range. #Irony
6003 2018-02-23 20:06:18 Prez was already against bump stocks since the Last Vegas shooting. Before then he probably didn't know what a bump stock was. Neither did I.

PEOPLE r wkg 4 change so 18 y/o can't buy rifles @Walmart, & get AR15's easier than a puppy @ an animal shelter; to stop sale of bump stocks. This ≠ authoritarian/totalitarian Iran.

6013 2018-02-23 20:03:40 They cannot "lock the AR-15 into fully-auto mode" AND they don't have mags as big as the military AND I want bump stocks banned AND bump stocks don't mean AR-15s are Assault Rifles. Admit defeat. It's obvious.

6025 2018-02-23 19:59:44 To gun advocates- no one wants to take away ur guns. It’s  a matter of having weapons of war on the street. 
No reason for high capacity clips. No reason for bump stocks. 
You have your 2A. 
How about our right to live without fear of being gunned down?
6026 2018-02-23 19:59:37 I am not interested in taking away your right to bear arms...a handgun, a rifle. I just don’t understand the need for assault weapons, high capacity ammunition and bump stocks. Explain to me where they are needed in everyday life.#BanAssaultWeapons
6027 2018-02-23 19:59:07 I too support the 2 Amendment-but it was written at a different time-and times are changing-the NRA needs to realize that- you can still have your guns-just No bump stocks/no big clips/better background checks/longer wait period AND let’s enforce the rules we already have!
6028 2018-02-23 19:58:59 Oh oh, let me do it! I propose  bans bump stocks immediately! There. Now what else do we need????
6029 2018-02-23 19:58:29 Stocks are so disconnected from reality that it's truly scary....
6030 2018-02-23 19:58:27 tYes on bump stocks & background checks. No on raising age requirement. If a person reaching 18 years of age is not a responsible adult, they never will be.
6031 2018-02-23 19:58:12 We believe that selling bonds w ridicously low coupons, to buy back stocks at ridic valuations, is somewhat #bullish
6032 2018-02-23 19:58:03 And I do support better security, better background checks, no gunshow loopholes, mandatory reporting of mental illness, mandatory reporting of all crimes, no bump stocks...
6033 2018-02-23 19:58:01 I believe pulse was close quarters and it’s still unclear what happens in Vegas.  It appears as an arms deal gone bad and bump stocks should be illegal. Fully autos already illegal and anything mimicking it should be as well.
6034 2018-02-23 19:57:59 With a mid-$70s basis on our $MDT  positions, I have to re-evaluate the degree to which I'm still  confident the stock will achieve and sustain the $100 range I believe  it's worth within a time frame I'm willing to wait. Opportunity risk.  #stocks

6047 2018-02-23 19:55:52 Actually blinded by lobbyists is a little more accurate. NRA just throws money and makes their own policy. NRA doesn't support anything except ban of bump stocks. Which is why Trump proposed that idea.

6049 2018-02-23 19:54:57 I have to correct you on the term “assault rifles”. It is illegal for the common citizen to have an automatic weapon. ARs are named that because the company is named Armolite. The AR, and other similar looking guns are all semi-auto. 1 trigger pull=1 shot. Bump stocks need banned
6050 2018-02-23 19:54:41 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the Florida shooting.

6065 2018-02-23 19:48:33 In Canada you can't but high capacity mags. 5 rounds max. No bimo stocks etc. Plus you can't but an assault rifle. These guns are for military and police. No need for anyone else to own one.
6066 2018-02-23 19:48:15 @TruthGundlach based on fed's comments today, do you think they'll do another operation twist? seems like they want short term rates higher, long term rates lower to support stocks
6067 2018-02-23 19:47:24 Bump stocks were used in the Vegas massacre… five months ago… and nothing was done, even proposed, by Trump. Now Trump is grandstanding the issue… disgusting…
6068 2018-02-23 19:47:24 I'm sorry. You value your toys over real freedom.  I guess you have stocks in all the assault weapons gunmakers, huh?  Since that's who benefits from the existence of the NRA?  You don't, you know.  You could have guns as a hobby anyway.
6069 2018-02-23 19:47:21 Bump stocks were used in #LasVegasShooting- not at #Parkland, so both bump stocks and #WeaponsOfWar must be banned...or make the magazines ammo only available at shooting ranges where they can use their (genocidal) toys in a controlled environment

6071 2018-02-23 19:47:01 Bump stocks, triggers that fire both ways (so twice per pull), and other modifications turn what's a rather clunky gun into a rapid-fire killing machine.  The modifications need to go.

6075 2018-02-23 19:45:46 AND...if people thought it was a problem - the stocks would be going up because they're be a buying spree before he law passed.   All he did was ban bump stocks and raise age to purchase
6076 2018-02-23 19:45:09 Not only “on the top of rocket”. It continues it fly - along Asteroid Belt... - now and stocks are following to the same direction.
6077 2018-02-23 19:45:05 A common saying during corrections is that stocks need to return to “fair value” before they stop falling.
Yet corrections are not consistent in the PE ratio they stop at (ranging from 11 to 33 for corrections since 1979) or how far PEs decline (ranging from 0.3 to 6.6 points).

6087 2018-02-23 19:41:59 The little mistakes matter. Outlawing bump stocks, LE ability to confiscate based on familial input, tighter reg, maybe limit mag capacity are good. Equating an AR15 w/an AK-47 is more than “a little mistake”.
6088 2018-02-23 19:41:58 Look at the charts of PXT, ERF and GTE for example and compare to SPE, WCP. The charts show which ones are the leaders and which one are the laggards in the sector. Why buy stocks in hopes they move higher when you can buy ones that are moving higher?

6092 2018-02-23 19:41:14 There are ways to limit how much killing they can do with ease and speed, though.  Limit the magazine size (which you talked about).  This si when GGiffords's shooter was taken down, when changing mag.  Ban bump stocks and triggers that shoot forward and back (pull and release).

6095 2018-02-23 19:40:52 I’m well aware, bump stocks are now officially on the ban list as well, which I’m ok with
6096 2018-02-23 19:40:20 You know the price of stocks on those 2 went down, right?
6097 2018-02-23 19:40:11 MONEY TALKSWall Street listens > govt listens to Wall Street! 
if you have stocks, DIVEST corps who support NRA w/ discount progs etc > INVEST in corps pulling support > TELL THEM WHY > corporate main pages "investor relations" link > contact the board or contact IR > be nice
6098 2018-02-23 19:40:08 This Florida school shooting was the exact bottom of the stock market correction. LoL. However, The Dallas police riots were a bit more bullish. Buy when there is BLOOD in the streets! Especially bump stocks!
6099 2018-02-23 19:39:57 Fact:. Anyone can learn to bump fire an AR with a piece of string, rubber band, belt loop, etc. Check out YouTube for countless examples. Hundreds of thousands of bump stocks have been sold and they've been used in a crime one time and never in a school shooting. #NiceSolution
6100 2018-02-23 19:39:49 I must have missed what Obama did about guns in schools. I just heard POTUS say he is behind enhanced background checks, banning bump stocks and raising the age to buy guns. Obama did non of this. So, why do you idealize this guy so much. What did he really do for you?
6101 2018-02-23 19:39:39 Can't tell you how many times I thought this to myself while playing penny stocks...and how much money I lost too thinking "it'll bounce "
6102 2018-02-23 19:39:25 Then one more question...sounds like Trump is willing to come to the table... example banning bump stocks...why is he so villified and after Sandy Hook nothing about Obama
6103 2018-02-23 19:39:25 #MAGA trump keeps talking tough on China. I call bullshit. China whispered it would sell us debt. Stocks drop a 1000 points one day. China can put USA in a depression with push of button. That's #MAGA
6104 2018-02-23 19:39:19 Can I ask why Morrison's now stocks a full range do crusha milkshake except bloody banana the only one I want?
6105 2018-02-23 19:39:06 There are other accessories on the market that function exactly like bump stocks. There are other guns on the market that function just like the AR-15. Ban high capacity magazines and you render bump stocks useless and limit the damage that guns like an AR can do.
6106 2018-02-23 19:39:04 I can’t wait to see the look on people’s faces when Trump announces he rolled back the Obama ATF rule that permitted AR-15’s to be modified with Bump Stocks!
6107 2018-02-23 19:38:42 100% dawn
6108 2018-02-23 19:38:39 the NRA has opposed banning bump stocks after Vegas, pushed for rescinding the regulations that where put in place to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental health issues, and been opposed to more extensive background checks
6109 2018-02-23 19:38:32 Buy Russian stocks:)
6110 2018-02-23 19:38:04 Bump-stocks are useless, don't know why Obama made them legal.
6111 2018-02-23 19:37:56 AR-15 is a specific make of assault rifle. The Pulse shooting used Sig Sauer MCX, an assault rifle. Vegas shooter used assault rifles with bump stocks to imitate full-auto weapons. VT and UofT shootings were the only shootings in the top 10 that did not involve assault rifles.
6112 2018-02-23 19:37:49 How does this make sense?  YOU CAN 3D PRINT A GUN - BUM STOCKS WHATEVER U WANT EVEN A HAMBURGER.
6113 2018-02-23 19:37:30 Massachusetts: First to ban bump stocks and cranks.  We're working, too. Thanks to @SenWarren  and @SenMarkey @sethmoulton
6114 2018-02-23 19:37:22 @Vanguard_Group since you are a shareholder in gun company stocks I will need to move my money elsewhere. It's not much but I will do my bit
6115 2018-02-23 19:37:22 Gov. Baldheaded-dildo is now 4 raising the age 2 21 4 buying a damn WEAPON OF WAR, + banning bump-stocks...eh, baby-steps!!!
6116 2018-02-23 19:37:05 Well in my ideal world there would not be guns at all. But being realistic, we could start banning bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons. (My daughter who is 13 taught me that)
6117 2018-02-23 19:36:58 Okay then bump stocks or any thing that makes something shoot faster should not be able to be bought. Yes the right to protect yourself is a thing but at what point are you protecting yourself too much
6118 2018-02-23 19:36:53 Uh they aren’t.  I trigger pull is 1 shot on mine.  (Semi-auto).  Military has 1 trigger pull many shots.  (Full auto). Not even close.  And yes I’m ok banning bump stocks and cranks
6119 2018-02-23 19:36:52 He said he's banning bump stocks, your thoughts?
6120 2018-02-23 19:36:51 This is 100% it. No object permanence whatsoever. "Ban bump stocks" sounds good one minute, then it's blaming video games.
6121 2018-02-23 19:36:42 Do it the same way you eat an elephant Steve. Institute universal background checks on all sales. Reduce magazine sizes. Ban the sale of any rifle that serves no purpose other than to kill people quickly. Ban bump-stocks. There's 4 ideas & not one gun confiscated. Win/win/win
6122 2018-02-23 19:36:17 Yeah he said he ban bump stocks, and expand background checks and raise age to 21. At least its something, I figured he wouldn’t do a thing

6124 2018-02-23 19:35:39 I can’t wait to see the look on people’s faces when Trump announces he rolled back the Obama ATF rule that permitted AR-15’s to be modified with Bump Stocks!
6125 2018-02-23 19:34:47 Please tell me...what do "bump stocks" have to do with Parkland?  Please come back and save us!!!!!
6126 2018-02-23 19:34:46 I can’t wait to see the look on people’s faces when Trump announces he rolled back the Obama ATF rule that permitted AR-15’s to be modified with Bump Stocks!
6127 2018-02-23 19:34:43 Bump stocks didn’t hurt any of those kids. Please don’t fall into the democratic snare
6128 2018-02-23 19:34:36 Why you're wrong:
Reduction of magazine size would only delay the inevitable by a second.
Bump stocks are a tool.  If the gun can be bump fired, you can do it with a belt loop.
"assault weapon" would band almost every gun out there.
waiting periods only help for crimes of passion
6129 2018-02-23 19:34:24 Um, @DLoesch, media stocks don't go up from mass shootings.  Gun manufacturer stocks do.  What you're saying about the media loving mass shootings is not just despicable, it's also much more applicable to the people you're trying to defend - gun makers.
6130 2018-02-23 19:34:22 Looks like the gravy train is about over for NRA.  I would put money on gun stocks in the short though, as typically there is a run on gun sales after an outcry over a mass shooting.  NRA has its members believing the big gun grab will come tomorrow morning, and sales skyrocket.
6131 2018-02-23 19:34:20 $rvl recent #sedar filing, special shareholders meeting. Peep the insider activity compared to where it sits now at .025 #Resources #TSX #tsxv #CSE #stocks #Stockstowatch
6132 2018-02-23 19:34:08 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.(No.131) #Duo30L11
6133 2018-02-23 19:33:41 But he also said he do more on background checks on bump stocks. U lose u cunt.
6134 2018-02-23 19:33:36 Far better stocks than SPE, WCP eg PXT, ERF, GTE (when oil goes up these companies run unlike SPE and WCP which look like dogs)
6135 2018-02-23 19:33:31 Nelson Mandela said “There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children." Using only a body count we can safely say that Congress & the @NRA have sold America’s soul4 power & bump stocks. #ParklandLeads #MSDStrong #MarchForOurLives
6136 2018-02-23 19:32:59 Bump-stocks, are U kidding? Maybe outlaw people's shoulders. Someone who know's how to shoot a weapon knows how to do the exact same thing as a bump-stock with their shoulder's.
6137 2018-02-23 19:32:58 BTW you're now on TV telling people that now you're going to require background checks for mental illness and ban bumper stocks. THE SAME DAMN THING PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD IN PLACE THAT YOU CANCELLED? You SICK TWISTED ASS. You did that so you could turn it around & make it your idea
6138 2018-02-23 19:32:56 @realDonaldTrump 4 positions on Gun Control in a week
1. ban sales of guns to people younger than 21
2. expand background checks
3. ban bump stocks like those used in mass shooting in Las Vegas
4. arming teachers

So, soon he will move to fifth position—
5. do nothing
#NEVERAGAIN
6139 2018-02-23 19:32:51 Sporting rifle.... Bump stocks.  I dont see a urgent need for stuff like that...To have it at home!
6140 2018-02-23 19:32:50 Just ignore that thing. They created the account solely to bash a sub penny stock. Pretty pathetic... im so glad i dont have time to create Twitter accounts to bash stocks worth less than a penny...
6141 2018-02-23 19:32:49 DEMAND more-registration requirements ELIMINATE LOOPHOLES gun shows+ private), implement waiting period, ban LARGE CAPACITY MAGAZINES, BUMP STOCKS AND MODIFIERS! Increase age requirements for all guns! #NeverAgain #GunReform Ban military WEAPONS!
6142 2018-02-23 19:32:07 The weapon. No we wanted the kit banned. The NRA is a pack of lying aholes. They have been lying about the ban on bump stocks, they have an ad out there that says "to prevent child molesters from using guns!" Fact: less than 1% of sex offenders use weapons in thier crime

6145 2018-02-23 19:30:52 Emma's question was:  "Do you believe that it should be harder to obtain the semi-automatic and - - weapons and the modifications for these weapons to make them fully automatic like bump stocks?" Ms. Loesh did NOT address this question directly, but ranted about the mentally ill.
6146 2018-02-23 19:30:35 Cool. Because without bump stocks, crazies will be forced to use very rare technology like belt loops in order to bump fire.

As long as wannabe hunters still have detachable high-capacity magazines to take down a deer, I'm happy.

6149 2018-02-23 19:30:14 Trump says no bump stocks, then pivots quickly to good-guy-with-a-gun #NRA argument. Says guard not going in "not his finest moment" says guard didn't "love the children" like teacher with a gun could. And why is One America News get 1rst?-> They're pro-Trump

6151 2018-02-23 19:30:09 I know enough about these weapons that I want all semi-automatic weapons banned along with high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  #CPAC2018
6152 2018-02-23 19:30:05 Lovely pic of you , was going to ask you what you did to deserve the stocks , but apparently you're an arsonist 
6153 2018-02-23 19:29:43 Bump stocks are not outlawed, they gave the Vegas shooter automatic weapons.
6154 2018-02-23 19:29:38 Honest question: is there a difference in how they can be modified, e.g. bump stocks or high capacity magazines?
6155 2018-02-23 19:29:25 Did Trump just mis spoke about giving everyone Bump Stocks?  Is he 7 years old?
6156 2018-02-23 19:29:24 “We are going to get rid of bump stocks," President Trump promises during a joint presser with @TurnbullMalcolm.
6157 2018-02-23 19:29:24 A) I want to ban bump stocks, and so does the President
B) Potential alterations to a tool aren't a reason to ban the tool itself
C) It can't fire 600 rounds in the span of a minute, even with a bump stock.
6158 2018-02-23 19:29:05 Read an article earlier today about how many state person funds are tied up in gun stocks.
6159 2018-02-23 19:28:54 Hahaha yun lang sana madaming stocks ng albums kc yung may mga kayang bumili ng more than 3 eh.
6160 2018-02-23 19:28:42 Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, large magazines, have universal background checks, rescind Dickey Amendment.
6161 2018-02-23 19:28:29 @realDonaldTrump President Trump - thank you for committing to background checks and getting rid of bump stocks. The next step needs to be to outlaw semi-automatic weapons
6162 2018-02-23 19:28:23 Please direct me to your profitable weed stocks. $MJX beating my ass on the daily. Also gonna need that chicken sandwich ticker.
6163 2018-02-23 19:28:21 FAKE NEWS...All they want is make NRA rich again.  Cum-on man,  we are not idiots just you!  Give people their guns but not war weapons...easy request!  No automatic, including bump stocks etc, no semi automatic.  Those are War weapons and for our armed forces and police ONLY.
6164 2018-02-23 19:28:07 President Trump has already told the A.G. to make bump stocks and similar paraphernalia that turns a legal gun into an automatic weapon, illegal.  He also is for more stringent background checks.  He also is for investigating other solutions. All of that is more than Obama did.
6165 2018-02-23 19:28:02 That is absolutely horrible, they should just strap that guy in some stocks and let the rest of the prison go to town on him for the rest of his life. #RealTalk
6166 2018-02-23 19:27:51 Trump promises a ban only on bump stocks. He is standing next to Australian PM - a country that responded to tragedy by confiscating weapons
6167 2018-02-23 19:27:11 I keep a close watch on this yield of mine 
I keep wondering when stocks won't find its rise benign
I keep thinking 3 percent ain't different than two point nine 
It's hard to divine, but I'll draw the line
6168 2018-02-23 19:27:11 This is a distraction. Bump stocks are not the issue. Start with at least a partial ban on assault weapons. That won't infringe on a person's 2nd amendment.

6170 2018-02-23 19:27:05 Mentally ill, background checks, bump stocks and "...certain other things..."  And "offensive capability" is code for arming the 'adept' staff.  <---Trump's plan.
6171 2018-02-23 19:27:03 @ScottMinerd What actually happens when rates move higher causing stocks to move lower?   Do large institutions like Guggenheim have computerized trading in place that triggers the selling of stocks?

6173 2018-02-23 19:26:52 Mr Trump I normally agree with you on everything but not on all this at all. I agree on the mental heath but changing the age to 21 is a joke and bump stocks are not a problem. The problem is crazy people!Changing the age 21 will change nothing.Arm the teachers!GUN free zones suc
6174 2018-02-23 19:26:51 I see how it's working, just take a look on penny stocks with big potential and new ideas.. Yet they need to ruin itself and investors to get to the FDA
6175 2018-02-23 19:26:28 And as a larger issue, guns affect more than just schools  so we should try to pass something to encompass all of these issues. Banning bump stocks, and probably other things I don’t know about
6176 2018-02-23 19:26:21 Politics is the art of the compromise. That's cool that there's an organization like this and I wish them all the best.  However, to want to destroy the most powerful and effective second amendment advocacy group over bump stocks is retarded as fuck.
6177 2018-02-23 19:26:15 KYLIE JENNER SNAPCHAT LOL  stocks plummet ... she doesn’t like it anymore  big drama
6178 2018-02-23 19:26:11 Q: What specific legislation will you propose re mass shootings? A: Background checks especially as it pertains to the the mentally ill, get rid of bump stocks, also very important to have offensive capability as well as defensive capability in the schools. (Trump briefing)
6179 2018-02-23 19:26:06 For once I agree with Dana, so instead let's ban all semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  #CPAC2018 #BoycottNRASponsors
6180 2018-02-23 19:26:05 I go that with the following changes:
1. The owner can be 18
2. Bump stocks banned
3. Ban all rapid fire guns
4. Ban AR-15 & military type guns due to the greater damage they do to victims as compared to a regular gun
6181 2018-02-23 19:26:03 Rick Scott is going to ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase a gun to 21. I feel like it's a trap. If I give him praise, he's going to tear my arm off and drag me into the sewer.
6182 2018-02-23 19:25:55 "We are going to get rid of bump stocks." says @realDonaldTrump
6183 2018-02-23 19:25:55 Asked what *specific* gun-related legislation he would send to the Hill, Trump says: "We are going to do a lot. We are going to be very strong on background checks... We are going to get rid of the bump stocks and certain other things"
6184 2018-02-23 19:25:45 Trump also mentions bump stocks and arming school staffers. No mention of raising rifle 
age to 21.
6185 2018-02-23 19:25:42 Not to mention the crazies who already own the stocks have them. This does nothing.
6186 2018-02-23 19:25:38 cost of these programs. Change the laws. Start there. You can’t say it won’t work until we try. Outlaw bump stocks and other such accessories. Mandatory storage guidelines.
6187 2018-02-23 19:25:30 Trump: "Well, we’re going to do a lot. We’re going to be very strong on background checks... We’re going to get rid of the bump stocks and we’re going to do certain other things."
6188 2018-02-23 19:25:24 .@realDonaldTrump at joint briefing with @TurnbullMalcolm on mass shootings: "We want to be very powerful, very strong on background checks, particularly where it pertains to the mentally ill. We're going to get rid of bump stocks and we're going to do certain other things."
6189 2018-02-23 19:25:22 President Trump on Florida shooting: we're going to be very strong on background checks...especially as it pertains to the mentally ill. We're going to get rid of bump stocks and certain other things. Very important to have offensive as well as defensive capability in schools.
6190 2018-02-23 19:25:11 When asked about specific gun legislation, Trump lists background checks; mental health; bump stocks
6191 2018-02-23 19:25:10 First question to Trump by US media on gun reform - Trump repeats his pledge to be 'very strong' on background checks, ban bump stocks, and arm teachers
6192 2018-02-23 19:25:02 Saying you support "Common Sense Gun Control/Regulation" is a slogan not a policy position. You need to be specific about what you're talking about - are we talking about regulating bump stocks, banning AR-15s, or enhanced background checks?
6193 2018-02-23 19:25:01 How many states will pass legislation that restricts the sale of guns, a specific type of gun, or gun accessories (clips, bump stocks) to any portion of its citizens (meaning full ban or aged based) by 6/30? Or you could make individual state markets.
6194 2018-02-23 19:24:57 I'm for 2nd Amendment rights. But...the AK-15 & ammo, bump stocks and like items should be banned and pulled from shelves ASAP. Like right now!! The legislation can follow but they need to halt ready access to this stuff today!
6195 2018-02-23 19:24:49 Trump: We're going to get rid of the bump stocks and we're going to do certain other things. @wdet

A: “We want to be v powerful, v strong on background checks. We’re going to get rid of bump stocks and do many other things.”
6198 2018-02-23 19:24:33 Manipulating the market to influence investment, consumer confidence etc not that good.
Depends where he holds his stocks!
And.. Like Pelosi giving to charity, I'll believe him more when he returns all Trump product manufacturing to the US.

You're making it easy to find the stocks I won't buy!
6201 2018-02-23 19:23:26 Only the far left fringe is calling to ban all guns, we both know that will never happen.  The vast majority of people that want a crackdown want common sense gun laws(restore ban on assault rifles, ban bump stocks, raise age to 21, stronger background checks)
6202 2018-02-23 19:23:02 An AR-15 is NOT an 'automatic weapon', but does fire faster, can be modified with bump stocks to be even faster, and the speed and damage of it's bullets are significantly worse. You won't regulate any of it - so be honest. #NeverAgain #BanAssaultRifles
6203 2018-02-23 19:21:55 I'm saying it depends on how the question is asked. All gun owners I know and have read about support background checks, so of course that will be high. Most support banning bump stocks, but it's not immediately clear that might not just be limited to bump stocks.
6204 2018-02-23 19:21:48 maybe it was at one time and they burned all their coal stocks and oh boy, look at them now.
6205 2018-02-23 19:21:47 Maybe the point should be that a certain segment of our country are obsessed with owing machines specifically designed to kill people. See: origin of ArmaLite AR-15, high-capacity mags, hollow-points, bump-stocks, etc.
6206 2018-02-23 19:21:44 I think Trumps proposal to ban bump stocks is a good choice. It will probably do more good than bad
6207 2018-02-23 19:21:32 Hi Kid, I have 2 value stocks for you $ACIA and $AIRG.   Both profitable, but below moving averages. Really on sale. Is this what you're looking for?

6209 2018-02-23 19:21:24 @CNN @realDonaldTrump @SenJoniErnst Already have drills. This isn’t new. Quit wasting our time ban the assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity clips, improve communications between military, civilian law enforcement, and schools.Special training for school security individuals
6210 2018-02-23 19:21:24 I tend to avoid battleground stocks like $W and $TSLA. I just don't think i have any edge in those situations. Someone else knows a whole lot more than me so its just a gamble.

6212 2018-02-23 19:20:41 Maybe the point should be that a certain segment of our country are obsessed with owing machines specifically designed to kill people. See: origin of ArmaLite AR-15, high-capacity mags, hollow-points, bump-stocks, etc.
6213 2018-02-23 19:20:33 If an influencer has the power to crash stocks from an app that easy,than it shows how weak the app is.And @KylieJenner you shouldnt just change your thoughts/ opinions just cause one tweet became damage on Wall Street. Grow up please #snapchat #KylieJenner #Kylie #evanspiegel
6214 2018-02-23 19:20:27 The nra is for banning bump stocks, and making sure the mentally desturbed and mentally ill aren’t able to obtain weapons, also I didn’t know owning a gun is a disease
6215 2018-02-23 19:19:52 1. Fund CDC research to understand  causes of gun violence. 2. Stricter background checks. 3. Raise minimum age to purchase. 4. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks. 5.  More funding for mental health & counseling services in our schools. 6. Close purchasing loop holes.
6216 2018-02-23 19:18:57 As a business man, you know sales, revenue, stocks, etc etc. But to control a nation with security and peace? It's obvious he hasn't been doing good in that field. But guess What, we're still gonna build that wall.
6217 2018-02-23 19:18:47 I always thought it would be Lucia who would end up in the stocks one day!  Hope you and your nieces enjoyed yourselves Bryony. Had a good day for it, apart from being cold of course.
6218 2018-02-23 19:18:28 Florida Gov R. Scott reveals a 500 million Dollar plan to boot school security that would among other things bar violent or mentally ill person’s from purchasing weapons Scott also says persons under the age of 21 would be prohibited from buying guns and so called bump stocks
6219 2018-02-23 19:18:20 I don’t think anyone needs hold on THAT powerful of a weapon. Bump stocks etc are unnecessary to have. A hand gun in your glove compartment/in a holster is completely different and someone understandable if you’re certified to do so.
6220 2018-02-23 19:18:08 800/rounds per minute? How? Bump stocks haven't been used in a shooting...not that they're any kind of accurate. Moot point.
6221 2018-02-23 19:18:04 Bump Stocks were review immediately after Las Vegas Shooting. The ATF Made a Formal Statement that BUMP STOCKS DO NOT TURN A SEMI-AUTOMATIC (FIRES 60-90 Rounds a Minute) 

INTO AN AUTOMATIC (FIRES 600-750 ROUNDS a Minute).

ATF STATES BUMP STOCKS ARE LEGAL.

6222 2018-02-23 19:17:54 The .@NRA requested the US government look into banning Bump Stocks after Las Vegas tragedy.

Catch up lefty.
6223 2018-02-23 19:17:39 Perhaps you haven't been listening? He is considering a number of options, from banning bump stocks, raising the age to legally own a firearm, and allowing teachers to voluntary carry concealed weapons for self defense. You don't have to agree, but at least acknowledge the facts.
6224 2018-02-23 19:17:35 I thought feelings were important? She felt unsafe.
Why does any group lobby Congress? 
You may recall the NRA reco banning bump stocks after Vegas. Not their fault nothing happened. The NRA promotes safety and training. 
You should get out of your own echo chamber.
6225 2018-02-23 19:17:21 Part of discussion I heard on NPR this morning, NRA to "ALLOW" Congress to ban bump stocks. I'm not a member of the NRA or did I vote for them to make my legislation. I'm far more afraid of the NRA than I am of AR15s.
6226 2018-02-23 19:17:10 Looks like another day for up in the am down in the pm for stocks. The fall in the 10yr yield today could influence stocks. The Nifty looks primed for a leg lower showing a potential NR.
6227 2018-02-23 19:16:18 Is the market going to avoid its daily afternoon swoon today?  My recovering stocks want to know.
6228 2018-02-23 19:16:17 2 of 2. But we ban assault weapons, ban high capacity cartridges, ban bump stocks, raise the minimum age to by any gun or riffle to 21, close gun show loop-holes, ban private sales, expand background checks w/ national database and guns only fire with owner fingerprint verified.
6229 2018-02-23 19:16:02 Design changed again and the wall in the middle was pushed back 300mm  no where near me stocks pressfit especially gas. They also decided to change a salamander from electric to gas so had to solder the last 35mm elbow too ha
6230 2018-02-23 19:15:31 Can someone tell the lady that the NRA believes rightly it is the ATFs job to regulate bump stocks and have not taken a position.  Also, NRA has ALWAYS been proponent of strict background measures which government would not approve. @marieharf
6231 2018-02-23 19:15:29 How can I rid it of abortifacient stocks?
6232 2018-02-23 19:15:25 I could go on. The problem posed by these firms, if there is one, is that they make a whole lot more money than their competitors. If you own their stocks you have no complaints. If you live in the cities where they HQ you love them.
6233 2018-02-23 19:15:07 The Second Amendment does not give your the right to bump stocks.
6234 2018-02-23 19:15:04 @RepMcClintock THREAD Trained personnel could not stop Fort Hood shootings.  Armed teachers are not the answer.  Need to ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks and mandate background checks.
6235 2018-02-23 19:14:14 Pulse Night Club, Parkland no bump stocks. And mental health isn’t a scapegoat.
6236 2018-02-23 19:14:06 This is simple debate, many want change , understandable. 21 to buy a gun , ban bump stocks, maybe even some type of mental health check. But banning guns and government mandated seizure of guns is just not ever going to happen here, maybe in Australia... not here
6237 2018-02-23 19:13:59 i stopped supporting them after vegas when they cucked on bump stocks
6238 2018-02-23 19:13:37 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
6239 2018-02-23 19:13:30 Yeah I highly recc! It's a very good vibe. My favorite store there is a small shop on the top floor that stocks really cool, diverse independent comics/zines and like, noise music  lmao
6240 2018-02-23 19:13:05 Yea that's retarded they are our literally only competent organization defending the second amendment right now. Your logic is literally "if they break on something like bump stocks they must be destroyed so my utopian version of the NRA can come into fruition" (it won't)
6241 2018-02-23 19:12:54 By the legal definition of machine gun, the ATF can't do anything about bump stocks without introduced legislation to ban them.
6242 2018-02-23 19:12:44 PRICE PREDICTION FOR ETHEREUM TODAY?                                                        #ethereum #eth #btc #ltc #bitcoin #BTCUSD #litecoin #ripple #xrp #investing #cryptocurrency #crypto #trading #ADA #xlm #stellar #Poloniex #coinbase #binance #altcoins #money #stocks #poll

6245 2018-02-23 19:12:09 Ban the high capacity magazine and bump stocks are rendered useless and all weapons immediately become less capable of causing quick, mass death.
6246 2018-02-23 19:12:03 Perhaps cruise ship stocks? Lol

6249 2018-02-23 19:10:43 It does make sense, because if you trade broad markets then psychology and herd behavior are more dominant making trends more robust. A single stock trade might be controlled by insiders or a few very big traders.
Have you tried your long term TA method on single stocks?
6250 2018-02-23 19:10:43 For one thing, if there’s not a ban on assault rifles, it’s a bag of shit. Forget about bump stocks and being 21.
6251 2018-02-23 19:10:41 Right now I think Trump will sway anyway that will get him votes or raise his approval ratings. I know little about bump stocks but I doubt Trump knows anymore than me, but I do know a great deal about guns in general and a fully automatic machine gun can fire much faster.
6252 2018-02-23 19:10:37 Having a great week worked mad OT, made extra cash on the side, and all my stocks are on the upside today 
6253 2018-02-23 19:10:10 @FedEx are you shipping AR15s and bump stocks? You don’t really know what’s in those boxes, do you? Maybe the weapon used in the next mass murder? If you love your kids > than you love $$$, sever ties with Putin-owned NRA otherwise we have choices & will #BoycottFedEx
6254 2018-02-23 19:09:37 Are they available in the uk and who stocks them?
6255 2018-02-23 19:09:33 If you're going to buy AR15 and bump stocks do it now before prices skyrocket! 

(Sales have been soft because of Trump)
6256 2018-02-23 19:08:45 I’ll thank you to read my comments on bump stocks before calling me a fool. And my need for exercising my constitutional rights is none of your concern or business.
6257 2018-02-23 19:08:30 Bombs are harder to get or build and use than semiautomatic firearms. Bombs are already regulated, licensed, and illegal for most folks. The automatic weapons ban also seems to mostly be working (exception: bump stocks)
6258 2018-02-23 19:08:00 Don't hate me for pointing out that a ban of bump stocks won't really do anything seeing as you can literally use a belt loop instead and it would work practically the same way. 
6259 2018-02-23 19:07:55 Gun stocks go up after mass shootings. LaPierre urged the public to buy more guns at CPAC
6260 2018-02-23 19:07:52 BUMP STOCKS DO NOT TURN ANY FIREARM INTO A MACHINE GUN. THEY USE THE SHOULDER TO ACT AS THE TRIGGER. THE FIREARM SHOOT ONE SHOT FOR EACH PULL.

FULL AUTOMATIC ONE PULL EMPTIES FIREARM UNLESS YOU RELEASE TRIGGER.

6261 2018-02-23 19:07:36 Seriously. #snapchat. Stocks drop b/c of a #Jenner tweet but NOT b/c a large % of rest of users have #complained.
6262 2018-02-23 19:07:17 Paranoia.  I didn't say you don't need home defense. I said why does anyone need an #AR15 for home defense.  You also don't "need" extra large clips, bump stocks, and silencers for "home defense" 
 Who are you honking off?
6263 2018-02-23 19:06:07 People should sell any mutual funds that include gun makers' stocks.

6266 2018-02-23 19:04:40 Some stocks will "Sell on News", yes, that happens, but if news is good, and more to come, than they hold and add.  Hard 2 decipher, but a good stock will go up on News and continue to uptrend.
6267 2018-02-23 19:04:24 And where exactly does it refer to bump stocks in the 2nd amendment? I'll wait....
6268 2018-02-23 19:03:37 Why do Stocks move up w/ no known filings or prs?  Birdies are everywhere, they get wind of material events to come, they take time 2 speak w CEO's of companies.  They spread the word. They dont sell on news, they wait for news to start to flow. Learn who has real info out there
6269 2018-02-23 19:03:17 But the arguments against AR-15s lead there. The argument against bump stocks lead there. But as we've outlined, even limiting citizens to hunting rifles and (maybe) low capacity handguns is in direct violation of the purpose of the second amendment and a danger to liberty
6270 2018-02-23 19:03:14 Your conversation was so useless, it made me want to get a gun to shoot myself. You'll find me in my apartment with five thousand bump stocks, I don't know or care about what they are or used for. Made a mistake asking about what that tail on a plug is for, not doing it again.
6271 2018-02-23 19:03:11 I think the point is that you have a CHOICE to have an abortion or not. I don’t care about bump stocks one way or the other...I don’t see the need to get rid of them.
6272 2018-02-23 19:03:06 Seems when market saturated (monopoly?) corps' stocks slow they go into a self-sabotage mode. Wondering if they are USING this opportunity. Wondering if they want stock to drop to drive transactions (fees)? Who gains? Who loses? #Starbucks #Enterprise #Omaha Just Say'n
6273 2018-02-23 19:02:58 Bump stocks tend to have more of a negative association being that it was an attachment used by the Vegas shooter to kill 59 people. High capacity magazines don’t really serve a purpose either in my opinion. I prefer saving lives over hobbies.
6274 2018-02-23 19:02:51 Reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban and declare the possession of bump stocks a crime.
6275 2018-02-23 19:02:45 This week we mourned 17 teenagers killed by a mentally ill person w/semi automatic gun! Last year we mourned the lives of 58  & prayed for 851 injured people killed by murderer w/ semi automatic guns,w/bump stocks &no known mental health history! Semi automatics must be outlawed!

6283 2018-02-23 19:00:27 Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Friday rejected calls to arm teachers with guns to prevent school massacres. 

Scott, a Republican, unveiled a plan to bar "violent or mentally ill" people from purchasing weapons, prohibit under 21 from buying guns, and outlaw so-called bump stocks.
6284 2018-02-23 19:00:25 Sure. Ban on assault weapons, and assault rifle style weapons. Ban on bump stocks and similar devices whether homemade or not. Make 3D printed guns illegal. Greatly reduce legal magazine size. Mandatory licensing similar to driving(tests, courses). More intense background checks.
6285 2018-02-23 19:00:09 If you insist upon keeping your relationship with the terrorist group NRA, I strongly advise you invest in UPS stocks. #BoycottNRA &/or #BoycottFedEx
6286 2018-02-23 19:00:08 @Avatican For the most part seems the problem with stocks like this ex $HMNY is too many get caught up in reading and/or listening too much.

6288 2018-02-23 18:58:55 Like you don't get all tingly when sales go up right after a mass shooting.  You should be ashamed.  I'll bet you buy stocks in the gun market after each mass shooting and then take a bath in the money you make.
6289 2018-02-23 18:58:35 #stocks Not a market with a whole lot of conviction today. Manipulators careful not to incite a big move to the downside as signs lead toward higher inflation and a 3% or more 10 Year Treasury note.
6290 2018-02-23 18:58:34 He did NOTHING about BUMP STOCKS after Vegas... HE IS NOT EMPATHETIC NOR SYMPATHETIC TO THESE KIDS AND VICTIMS OF THESE MURDERS. REMOVE SEMI/AUTOMATIC RIFLES, REMOVE EXTENDED AMMO CLIPS, REMOVE BUMP STOCKS, REINSTATE EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS, RAISE THE AGE, BAKER ACT PEOPLE
6291 2018-02-23 18:58:16 It's the system that failed, not the law in regards to background checks. Feel like magazine sizes doesn't make much of a difference. They'll just carry more of the smaller ones then. Bump stocks is a good one. And agree with high power rifles. Time will tell!
6292 2018-02-23 18:58:07 @nra doesn’t give a crap about bump stocks. They are an add on to a gun/rifle. NRA cares about gun sales only. This bump stock ban is distraction
6293 2018-02-23 18:57:47 What about Massachusetts banning bump stocks? People who lawfully owned those were forced to turn them in or face felony charges. The gov forced people to turn in lawfully owned and paid for property without compensation. Now tell me how this is right
6294 2018-02-23 18:57:22 Why are bump stocks legal? They turn a semi-auto into a fully-auto for only a couple hundred dollars. Profit is the only reason the @NRA opposes their ban #NRABoycott #CPAC18 #CPAC #CPAC2018

6296 2018-02-23 18:56:42 In answer to your question, what is one thing Donald Trump can do to make his supporters stop supporting him, perhaps banning bump stocks / more gun control is the one thing.  We shall see.

6307 2018-02-23 18:51:59 According to Slide Fire, their bump stock can allow you to fire 100 rounds in 7 seconds (roughly 860rpm). I fail to see how any logical person could still consider this weapon semi-automatic. Essentially bump stocks are only legal bc they technically don't alter trigger mechanics

6311 2018-02-23 18:51:23 Bump stocks can make an AR15 behave like full auto.  Not very accurate, but much faster.  Should be banned, even though semi-auto can be more effective due to better accuracy.
6312 2018-02-23 18:50:59 I've never cared for bump stocks. applied to a firearm which isn't made to fire on auto makes it tend to jam.
6313 2018-02-23 18:50:49 the proposed legislation also includes a ban on bump stocks.
6314 2018-02-23 18:50:43 I'm happy today because I unlocked the secret to a pompadour with shaved hair on the sides and now I look like your boss that let's you have a break whenever, buys you doughnuts, and has an inexplicably expensive car above his pay grade. Meow. Wanna. Buy some stocks?
6315 2018-02-23 18:50:08 Im sure anyone who bails on the gun stocks will regret it soon enough. RGR on rebound to 68 again . People tried to bury Philip Morris/Altria Mo and its near 5yr highs. Major holders include massive institutions that will make serious $$$ on the lows gunmakers are at now.
6316 2018-02-23 18:49:55 Should Britain gift 25% of its fish stocks to Holland, what will they give in return of equal value? Very little I would imagine.
6317 2018-02-23 18:49:34 @SoftBank Collaboration of Softbank with Walmart will increase Sofbank-Walmart stocks by 50%. Don't wait another chance of strong enter on American market. Push now.
6318 2018-02-23 18:49:27 We're arguing about trees and ignoring the forest. In other words, bump stocks effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into the equivalent of an automatic rifle. If you doubt, it listen to the audio of the Vegas shooting. So let's speak real impact, not tech differences.
6319 2018-02-23 18:49:11 Wrong!

As passed by the Congress:A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a Free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Nothing about bump stocks, assault weapons, ownership by those with psychiatric conditions.
6320 2018-02-23 18:49:04 Right - banning “bump stocks” alone doesn’t solve the problem. Nor does banning “AR-15s”. Even if banning is the best solution it will have to be more generically-defined or were just making more loopholes.
6321 2018-02-23 18:48:59 Ban bump stocks okay I will just use a belt loop I mean these people are so stupid or make one its simple. This crap is mental it has nothing to do with GUNS. Its all about mentality and determination, a bump stock was used once in a mass shooting that we still know NOTHING ABOUT
6322 2018-02-23 18:48:56 Bump stocks are a red herring. Concentrating on them is a waste of time and energy. Ban the semi automatic guns and bump stocks are useless.
6323 2018-02-23 18:48:38 If, I launch my election campaign for 2020 Presidential bid; I'm assuming I would receive an F- from the @NRA. The low rating would be derived from my desire to see a permanent ban on "assault weapons" and "bump stocks".Only law enforcement and the military would be exempt.

6327 2018-02-23 18:47:40 Glad the libs don't hate my 7.62x51 M1A rifles. They have organic stocks though very green.
6328 2018-02-23 18:47:28 Why do corporations need a tax break? They will just buy back stocks.

6330 2018-02-23 18:46:07 Shoulder stocks may improve accuracy by reducing the effect of kick, but they won’t magically increase muzzle velocity or force of impact, both of which are much greater with a rifle.
6331 2018-02-23 18:46:00 Drumpf claims he's banning bump stocks... I'll believe it when I see it.
6332 2018-02-23 18:45:37 Son took me shopping and I bought enough basics to see me through a siege. Bought extra frozen veg and berries for freezer too. UHT milk here.  I always have good stocks. I can stay in and read if too cold
6333 2018-02-23 18:45:30 Gov Rick Scott of Fla. has proposed raising the legal age of ownership to 21, a ban on bump stocks, funds for hardening schools and employing at least one police officer at each one. It's a start, and proof that these kids are making a real difference. Perfect? No. It's a start.
6334 2018-02-23 18:45:29 So the other night, my son and friend were talking on the phone. About girls? No. Video games? No. TV? No. About which stocks to invest in and what time the market opens/closes. Seriously? That's #Boone2020 @Boone_County @Gray_Middle
6335 2018-02-23 18:44:42 Let me tell you. This software has made me money trading stocks the past few years. The addition of the Crypto Channel is great.. All the altcoins are getting added soon. I will be able to back-test all the altcoins and get a.i. alerts for them so I can day trade.
6336 2018-02-23 18:44:36 @vplus watch their stocks
6337 2018-02-23 18:43:54 #NEVERAGAIN Trump should stop pointing fingers & look in mirror. Trump's son's friend manufactures bump stocks & "telling DOJ" to look into it when he knows Congress must do it b/c Sup crt ruled that.
6338 2018-02-23 18:43:51 As soon as I get rich off of penny stocks I’m going to do 3 things. Go to Qdoba, buy a Porsche, and get a lifetime NRA membership.
6339 2018-02-23 18:43:50 Also someone with multiple pistols wouldn't be able to fire accurately at the same rate, given a rifle barrel is more than twice as long as a pistol barrel, and that a semi-auto rifles typically have stocks.
6340 2018-02-23 18:43:43 @drew__dorsey i was watching the news and a segment about kylie's tweet making snapchat's stocks drop came on and i'm pretty sure they used part of your vid on clevver news 
6341 2018-02-23 18:43:39 But has bump stocks got anything to do with your rights
6342 2018-02-23 18:43:30 @danaloesch  Lady the ONLY thing you care about is GUN SALES -PERIOD.  IT's about our children, NOT your tired ass. Raise the age to 21, ban bump stocks & ban AR-15 to non military.  STOP THE IGNORANCE!  NO ONE IS GETTING RID OF THE 2ND AMENDMENT, SO GET OVER YOURSELF.  #unite
6343 2018-02-23 18:43:17 $CANN.c making a new high for the day.  The ask side is starting to look like the Sahara Desert. Would be nice to see a 0.60$+ close as we draw closer to multiple major catalysts. Believe in your DD. #acmpr #stocks #cannabis #marijuana #weed #investing

6345 2018-02-23 18:43:09 I don't give a shit about bump stocks, in reality if we give up a little bit of our rights sooner or later they're just gonna come for the rest. In reality I shouldn't have to give up my gun rights because some psychopath decided to use that particular gun to shoot up a school
6346 2018-02-23 18:42:07 And gun stocks are tumbling on the market today.
6347 2018-02-23 18:40:58 @OrangeBlue760 I mean this is the kindest way possible, but as somone in the finance/investment industries, I can't even begin to describe how horrified I was to hear an ad yesterday encouraging listeners to take out home equity loans to "buy stocks or even the bitcoin dip"
6348 2018-02-23 18:40:19 3/ I'm glad Trump came out saying we need to do mental background checks and get rid of selling bump stocks in light of the Parkland shooting. I hope he sticks to that like glue. I want and hope with all my heart Trump becomes someone who will do what's morally right for America.
6349 2018-02-23 18:40:03 The value of the contract is meaningless in the trade or investment. its not like stocks. Its the sheer quantity of the trade that would equate to the over taxating. like i said, a small trader could easily be taxed on  50,000 trades a year.
6350 2018-02-23 18:40:02 As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach. trade forex stocks

6352 2018-02-23 18:39:32 One of those jenner girls  said they didnt like the update 4 it and the stocks dropped like 6 % 
6353 2018-02-23 18:39:08 Nra also loves it because their stocks and money go up soon as a mass shooting everyone scared their gonna take their guns.  So it's a back and fourth dance.
6354 2018-02-23 18:38:35 The USDA's numbers weren't worthy of serious consideration. It had this year's exports at 2.1 billion, which will require quite a turn around. Next year's exports are at 2.3 billion bushels. Even at that, stocks were still more than ample.
6355 2018-02-23 18:38:29 Definitely digging not having a state income tax down here. Makes trading stocks a helluva lot easier
6356 2018-02-23 18:38:00 @ASavageNation I am boycotting any company that boycotts the NRA and will be selling any stocks that I may hold in those companies as well. Also urge everyone to do the same.
6357 2018-02-23 18:37:35 @SavageNation I am boycotting any company that boycotts the NRA and will be selling any stocks that I may hold in those companies as well. Also urge everyone to do the same.
6358 2018-02-23 18:37:25 CRAVING A WHAT
6359 2018-02-23 18:37:18 You don't need to abolish the 2A. You don't even need to confiscate existing guns. Regulating bump stocks, magazine sizes, waiting periods, mandatory universal background checks, national database, and banning new sales of ar15s would all be perfectly constitutional.
6360 2018-02-23 18:37:03 Okay but we don’t need things like bump stocks and in reality we don’t need guns like AR 15
6361 2018-02-23 18:36:54 I am boycotting any company that boycotts the NRA and will be selling any stocks that I may hold in those companies as well. Also urge everyone to do the same.
6362 2018-02-23 18:36:45 If stocks are going to take another tumble, I think it would be preceded by a #bitcoin decline

6367 2018-02-23 18:36:02 Teachers are also beginning to ask their pension fund managers to make sure no gun stocks are in their retirement portfolios.
6368 2018-02-23 18:35:57 Furthermore, in case you have not been informed.  Bump stocks to NOT turn a weapon in to a machine gun.  They do not raise the fire rate near that far.  A bump stock can be imitated using a belt loop with just a little practice.  I am a strong supporter, but that is wrong.
6369 2018-02-23 18:35:56 Quite happy with $TSLA gains, up 10% in average price on multiple buys placed at or near lows this past month. Holding $350 now would be a good thing and yes, #Tesla may possibly be at resistance now, and #bullish expectation must always “climb a wall of worry”. #Stocks #TA
6370 2018-02-23 18:35:16 I mean insta was already shitting on them and now them acting like a 13 year old girl who just got her first boyfriend does not help their case lol.

6371 2018-02-23 18:35:15 Start hitting the ASK, Bishop just indicated the team is finalizing the filings and it's the top priority for them.

6372 2018-02-23 18:35:08 I am boycotting any company that boycotts the NRA and will be selling any stocks that I may hold in those companies as well. Also urge everyone to do the same.
6373 2018-02-23 18:34:59 So your saying we should ban ALL guns and citing Chicago shootings as your reference. Interesting strategy. I was just going after semi-auto assault weapons & bump stocks and adding thorough background checks and mental evaluation for all gun owners.

6379 2018-02-23 18:33:44 WE THINK BUMP STOCKS AND BACKGROUND CHECKS INCLUDING MENTALHEALTH ISSUES ARE OK FOR 2NDAMENDMENT RITES NO NEED NRAPROTECTION
6380 2018-02-23 18:33:11 Bump stocks need an assault weapon, treat the disease not the symptom. If you can't name one positive outcome using an assault weapon by civilians, outlaw them. Just common sense and political courage.
6381 2018-02-23 18:33:07 Customers here expect me to know everything but like, my guy I'm just the depressed bitch that changes signs and stocks the store
6382 2018-02-23 18:32:40 Ban bump stocks and extended magazines. Reapply for gun license every year. If we have to renew our licenses to drive then we should renew our licenses to own guns. Increased screening and training to own gun. You are not allowed to take gun you bought home until 7 days....

6388 2018-02-23 18:30:18 Unless bump stocks or other modification...NRA is  opposed to ban on bump stocks.
6389 2018-02-23 18:30:02 If it means anything, according to MT Newswire, gun manufacturer stocks are all getting hit today in the stock market due to the governor of FL decision to back changes in gun purchasing requirements

6392 2018-02-23 18:28:58 @investingidiocy I read you very interesting article about equities in CTA strategies. I am interested in opinions about the uses of index futures instead of single stocks. Do you think the same about them?
6393 2018-02-23 18:28:41 I will make sure I speak to the masses about how @Discover treats their customers who were down on their luck! I will be going on every social media I own to let my experiences be heard! I’m bringing down stocks and everything! I will not stop!

6395 2018-02-23 18:28:37 @amazon @JeffBezos .. Please don't let "any" group have a platform to spread their personal beliefs.  This NRA will hurt your stocks,....most of your income comes from non NRA members
6396 2018-02-23 18:28:19 You should publicly push @GunOwners. They are no compromise when it comes to the 2nd, unlike the @NRA, who has helped restrict gun rights multiple times, including now with bump stocks.
6397 2018-02-23 18:27:49 I have no problem with better background checks or the ban of bump stocks, but changing the age to 21 to legally own a gun is ridiculous
6398 2018-02-23 18:27:18 I think it’s a confluence of factors. $ZB_f bouncing off LT trendlines; short interest in $ZN_f etc; price-sensible allocation trades out of stocks in to bonds (while buybacks support former). Also I remember pension funds being big buyers in to Mar 1 in desk days of past(!)
6399 2018-02-23 18:27:13 was a little kneejerk w googl but meh those big price stocks options can drop  massively super fast
6400 2018-02-23 18:26:22 My parents legit cussed me out for investing more money into crypto and stocks. Funny thing is, they legit don’t know what a stock is or how trading even works. Said I was gambling. It’s gonna be funny when I flaunt thousands to them after a while. 
6401 2018-02-23 18:25:42 QUEEN BEE, honey stocks plummet
6402 2018-02-23 18:25:29 Nope, I haven't. I agree with you on the automatic weapons, e.g. (which is why I've supported banning bump stocks). But you're offering NO limiting principle other than a near-total gun ban. So let's at least try for one! Maybe we'll agree on some other stuff!
6403 2018-02-23 18:25:24 Maybe we should rename bump stocks Laura ingraham b/c she’s sent out to rapidly fire her mouth with nonsense and hopefully soon be extinct.
6404 2018-02-23 18:25:22 My take: The decisions to raise the legal age to 21 is the bare minimum that should be done. Spending $500 million on mental health and school safety makes sense if the money is spent wisely and not given to politically connected contractors. Bump stocks? Trump beat you. 1/2
6405 2018-02-23 18:25:11 Oh and first state to ban bump stocks

6407 2018-02-23 18:25:08 The second amendment doesn't mention bump stocks.
6408 2018-02-23 18:25:01 How does Obama have those kids backs? He had the most mass shootings under his Presidency.  Gun stocks and the industry grew 300 percent. He has done so much for all of those kids shot and killed in Chicago for 8 yrs.Maybe if he stays away from politics he will do more.
6409 2018-02-23 18:25:00 Govt overspending, check; political gridlock, check; junk(ier) status, check.
So, of course, stocks and currency in Brazil are doing well.
Go figure!
6410 2018-02-23 18:24:37 He also gets credit for making bump stocks legal.
6411 2018-02-23 18:24:32 Florida will not be the first. There are a few other states than ban bump stocks and have for a while.

6413 2018-02-23 18:24:12 Bone Spurs has the stones to call ANYONE a coward? For the record, I am a veteran opposed to armed schools. STEP 1, 2, 3, 4: BAN Assault Style Weapons, high capacity mags, bump stocks AND make sure the age is raised to, at least, 21. Common Sense is in short supply these days.
6414 2018-02-23 18:24:04 Let’s also not forget that stopgap measures like raising the age of purchase or banning bump stocks is literally the least we can do. We need to signal that we won’t be placated by minor fixes.
6415 2018-02-23 18:24:00 She’s absolutely right! please do your homework on how bump stocks perform. People  say something untrue and everyone jumps on the bandwagon. As if  it’s a matter of fact. Banning a bumpstock is going to lead us into damnation when it comes to our fire arms . Be careful
6416 2018-02-23 18:22:56 Buy more at 3?
6417 2018-02-23 18:22:20 And in the mean time, restrict sales of bump stocks and high capacity magazines, reinstate a national waiting period (1 week should be fine)

6420 2018-02-23 18:21:26 With the statement that “an AR can easily be changed into a full auto” are talking about bump stocks or changing the innards of the AR so that it operates like a select fire rifle?
6421 2018-02-23 18:21:02 @BrianMastFL 
THANK YOU for your support in ending assault weapons for anyone under 21.  Semi, automatic weapons bump  stocks should be military use. Period.

6423 2018-02-23 18:20:53 Thanks to the company that stocks the lunchroom for having the first sausage with skin I couldn't bite through. It was like trying to eat a tube of Jimmy Dean still in the wrapper.
6424 2018-02-23 18:20:51 $IVTY Stock is on a trajectory like it's going to pass through $0.00 in a few months. Stocks can't go negative, right?
6425 2018-02-23 18:20:40 Thank you, Sen. Leahy. At the minimum, here in VT and on the federal level we should: 1. Ban AR 15 assault weapons, 2. Ban high cap. mags and 3. Ban bump stocks. Just these three could save lives!!
6426 2018-02-23 18:20:32 Market valuation is an issue to watch now: While #earnings growth fuels #stocks, some valuations—because they were already elevated—are too high and probably need to come down. #stockmarket #SP500
6427 2018-02-23 18:20:18 Wrap and 5 bites filed: A ban on bump stocks, new age limits on gun ownership and a whole lot of money to harden the schools. That's what the governor wants in response to the Parkland shooting. #fnnnews
6428 2018-02-23 18:19:47 While DLoesch doesn’t have personal responsibility the NRA does. They need to agree to increase the age limit, ban bump stocks, & agree to ban any/all weapons to the mentally ill. If they do they might earn some credibility back.  We can work on Mental health and safety.
6429 2018-02-23 18:19:44 6. Do we charge huge taxes on guns to fund it? Installation & maintenance will cost. Someday politicians will take that money for some other projects. The systems would degrade, breakdown become outdated and fail, kids will die so that everyone can keep their bump stocks
6430 2018-02-23 18:19:09 I guess we will have to paint them white and put wooden stocks on them so they will look like any other rife on the public market...
BUT, we don't have to. The Constitution does not control firearms....some unconstitutional laws do like immigration and anchor spawn.
6431 2018-02-23 18:19:02 How about let's start with banning assault weapons and bump stocks?   Nice try pivoting, lady.
6432 2018-02-23 18:18:58 NRA gunsexuals ignore

1/ ‘a well trained militia’ phrase; 
2/they had muskets then, not AR-15 and bump stocks; 
3/circumstances addressed environment,wilderness, and isolation which was different than now
6433 2018-02-23 18:18:39 Semiautomatic rifles are not used by militaries though the rifles issued do have a semiautomatic function. Bump stocks are not used by any military around the world and are more in line with something a modern militia would have as opposed to a military
6434 2018-02-23 18:18:29 Australia, Japan & the U.K. have mental illness and people experiencing psychosis. Just sayin’ 
We need to take steps & see what works. Raising the age requirement, eliminating bump stocks, metal detectors everywhere. We should do absolutely everything to save our kids/ourselves.
6435 2018-02-23 18:17:50 Bump stocks do need to be ban no reason for them other than “fun” but yet they caused too many problems so I’m fine with that. Take them. Yes I like guns. Should someone have to go to sleep fearing they won’t wake up with a child anymore. Never. Do what needs to be done.
6436 2018-02-23 18:17:38 WHY RAISE THE AGE TO 21?... What is that going to do? I'm pissed enough about bump stocks. You better attach with this legislation, the increase of voting age to 21. Your eroding my support of you very quickly with this.
6437 2018-02-23 18:17:07 STocks Gun stocks drop.
6438 2018-02-23 18:16:37 This is the EXACT same play he did with DACA. EXACTLY. Equate the executive authority on bump stocks to the DoJ calling DACA unconstitutional and ending it. Bump stocks may have the same thing happen, "DoJ here. We want to ban them, but our lawyers believe congress needs to."

6440 2018-02-23 18:15:39 I agree. And here's my question to you. JG says correct level of the 10-year is the avg between nominal US GDP and the German 10-Year. What if that relation fails? 15 yrs ago, it was just US GDP. Go back to that, and you're at 5%+ on the 10-year. I'm not long stocks into that.
6441 2018-02-23 18:15:19 You can't stop the intent, but you can limit the damage by banning high capacity magazines, bump stocks, semi-automatic rifles PLUS enforcing mandatory waiting periods, closing gun show loopholes, and requiring classes and certifications
6442 2018-02-23 18:15:16 They prevent debate. They prevented the expansion of background checks. They won't even support a legal ban on bump stocks (leave it to the atf, they say).
6443 2018-02-23 18:14:03 Trump is firing the first shot with bump stocks, coordinating with the NRA, Rick Scott, and others via executive authority, so he can say, "Hey, I banned bump stocks, Obama's AFT didn't. Your turn Dems."
6444 2018-02-23 18:13:49 Which stock companies trade NRA stocks? I would like to push for divestment. #BoycottNRA
6445 2018-02-23 18:13:36 The NRA is so insecure. No one said we want the 2nd amendment removed. All we want is better back ground checks, remove bump stocks from markets and to stop selling AR’s. I don’t think it’s asking too much. Why is the NRA acting like a spoiled little brat!
6446 2018-02-23 18:13:08 It's a start. But what's the point of banning bump-stocks if you don't ban semi-autos or high capacity clips?
6447 2018-02-23 18:13:06 Banning bump stocks. President Trump has brought up banning the sale of bump stocks.   /3
6448 2018-02-23 18:13:00 Oh my god, but this means only “the bad guys” will get bump stocks!
I’m glad the kids finally gave him the spine he needs
6449 2018-02-23 18:12:32 Rick Scott banning bump stocks, increasing purchasing age, armed guards in schools, backround checks keeping mentally ill people from guns are ALL good but mere bandaids. We’re one mass shooting away from realizing its not going to stop it from happening again. It’s not enough!
6450 2018-02-23 18:12:22 Wed: Stocks struggle as rate hike jitters return
Thu: Stocks climb as rate hike jitters remain
Fri: Stocks rally as rate hike jitters ease
6451 2018-02-23 18:12:16 Stocks being issued for the first time is a way for companies to raise money. They sell stock certificates, and use that money to finance their operations. So that's one of the uses of the stock market-- to allow companies big and small to get financing
6452 2018-02-23 18:12:07 Besides killing more humans in less time, what would be the 'legitimate' purpose of bump stocks? Target practice? Killing wild boars? Bears? I guess idk the exact need. If someone can explain
6453 2018-02-23 18:11:24 Well it depends who you give the weapon too. Guns are not dangerous if you put them in the right hands. Like doing secure background checks and reducing bump stocks is a start.
6454 2018-02-23 18:10:49 Yeah it’s cool. Postcards should be fine, can’t promise on hoodie (at least immediately) since SE Cafe barely stocks clothing (they usually only have 1/2 of each clothing item out...) but I’ll try my best! What size hoodie would you want me to grab?
6455 2018-02-23 18:10:02 Trump: maybe mental health checks, eliminate bump stocks, review assault rifle bans

NRA: we will only accept solutions that sell more guns

Trump: arm the teachers! Arm everyone! this is the only smart solution!
6456 2018-02-23 18:10:02 No Bump Stocks! I stand with Pres Trump and these changes he’s trying to make things better!!
6457 2018-02-23 18:10:00 Stocks allow companies to split their ownership across lots of people.
Stocks are valued by summing up the future value of their payments (which are uncertain). These payments are either future dividends, or the value you will be able to sell your stock certificates at later
6458 2018-02-23 18:09:53 The Fed Monetary Policy Report made news in 2014 when it said Internet and biotech stocks were ``substantially stretched.'' Has it made news since?
6459 2018-02-23 18:09:43 Wall st. big boys were probably having breakfast with Amazon stocks before even thinking about crypto.
6460 2018-02-23 18:09:28 Watch out for a strong EOD rally in $WATT. They have news about their products pending next week and such a move will leave those waiting for news confirmation behind ...and that's what good stocks usually do. A close around 26$ is a possibility in my opinion.
6461 2018-02-23 18:09:25 It was a warm spring morning,the sun was shining through the dense trees of this large forest. In a cleared out space by the nearby creek stood not just breeding posts and stocks but a group of tall, brutish, and quite horny Elk warriors.They had come  for your wives, at any cost
6462 2018-02-23 18:08:24 PSA: A SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE WILL ONLY FIRE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU PULL THE TRIGGER, AND BUMP STOCKS DO NOT NOT MAKE THEM FULLY AUTOMATIC. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT GUNS WITHOUT HAVING ANY EXPERIENCE, PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH...
6463 2018-02-23 18:08:22 Scott & GOP are SOS(Stuck on Stupid). It isn't about age. Shooters in Las Vegas, Orlando, Sutherland Springs, TX, San Bernardino, Wilkes Barre were not 18. Ban assault rifles, NoFlyNoBuy, stop bump stocks, must register. NRA is far fr "well-regulated." NRA is  not US Military.
6464 2018-02-23 18:08:06 #SpinelessCoward Scott 1. "BAN" .223 cal. NATO bore in weapons, ban .762 NATO bore in weapons, PERIOD. This almost automatically reduces deaths by 50% OR MORE. 2. 21 AGE ONLY IF #1 IMPLEMENTED. AGE 30 IF NOT. BUMP STOCKS ""NEVER"" should have been legal. We SAW what happened @MSD
6465 2018-02-23 18:07:36 .@DLoesch and the @NRA's desperate, loathsome claim that "many in the media love mass shootings" is a laughably transparent cover for the fact that mass shootings are, in fact, in the interest of the gun lobby. Gun sales and stocks almost always rise in their wake.
6466 2018-02-23 18:07:08 Way to FUD when you have no clue
6467 2018-02-23 18:06:42 Hey Wane (as in u r waning), you spouted that bull sht in 2008.  Gun sales rocketed, no changes in the 2nd amendment, no FEMA camps - 5 million members out of over 300 million Americans.  I wonder if you and that horrid Dana have stocks in the gun companies?
6468 2018-02-23 18:06:38 Shout out to @SandyCohenIII. Averaging 16.1 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 2.3 apg with a 52.3 EFG%. Throw in 2.4 stocks per game (steals + blocks).

BTW - tossed in 36 points last night vs. Oakland w/ 11 boards, 5 assists (only 17 FGA, that's efficiency folks). 

Make the home fans proud. #mubb
6469 2018-02-23 18:06:33 Remember when they initially came out and said Paddock built a platform to shot off of? That narrative went away when the fact bump stocks don't work on bi-pods was exposed....guns with bump stocks were pictured on bi-pods in hotel room...strange.
6470 2018-02-23 18:06:15 What’s your stand on bump stocks?
6471 2018-02-23 18:06:07 $RARE $EDIT $VRTX $INCY $FSLR $CRSP $BLUE Stocks always have tendency up and down.  Take profits and prepare for Monday selloff.

6473 2018-02-23 18:04:49 I am  advocating changes two gun laws i e ban AR-15, ban bump stocks, raise the age to buy a gun, do thorough background checks, and lastly there is no need for heavy duty artillery to keep your home safe in a city.
6474 2018-02-23 18:04:43 $CHSH moving cause otcmarkets SS was updated but that wasnt done by the co. its done automatically for all stocks that have that TA its a program that otcmarkets is trying
6475 2018-02-23 18:04:38 #FLAG: RICK SCOTT'S "ACTION PLAN" IN THE WAKE OF PARKLAND...

- Raise Min. Age to 21.
- Ban Bump Stocks.
- "Tougher" Background Checks & Wait Periods.
- Toughening the "Baker Act" that permits police to place mentally ill in custody.
- $450M for School Security and Mental Health.
6476 2018-02-23 18:04:32 People upset over #snapchatupdate and #kyliejenner tweets about not using it anymore causing chaos for their stocks....isn’t there more important issues to get resolved than the #snapchatlayout ???
6477 2018-02-23 18:04:28 Bump stocks? Really, thats the best you can do ?
#BoycottNRA
6478 2018-02-23 18:04:24 I have no problem with hunting, or defending your family. I don't want to get rid of guns - I do want to restrict access to assault rifles with bump stocks. I want more screening, more mental health care for everyone who needs it, and less killing children on school grounds!
6479 2018-02-23 18:04:21 So. You've been looking for where Richard Burton got his stocks of jelly beans since you were, yourself, a baby? :-)
6480 2018-02-23 18:04:14 Banning bump stocks is not a solution.  Diminishing our rights while pretending to increase safety is never a solution.
6481 2018-02-23 18:03:56 The second amendment is the right to safeguard yourself from Tyranny.  Stricter background checks, ban bump stocks, fine, but your network along with the DNC has tried to overthrow our president the last year and you want me to give up what??  THIS IS ON THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES!!
6482 2018-02-23 18:03:35 Jim Cramer always showing love to Hormel and the stock is down 9% so far this year. #Stocks

6484 2018-02-23 18:03:07 Taking it day by day.  Not sure it is accurate to assume if interest rates flip to secular uptrend that stocks and the world are doomed.  It just may be that stocks will outperform bonds by wide margin.  All TBD.  Market will decide.
6485 2018-02-23 18:02:49 Financial advisers and 401k holders need to begin selling off funds with gun stocks. Hit them hard.
6486 2018-02-23 18:02:41 @Parianas @_machiparu_ @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
6487 2018-02-23 18:02:05 Bump stocks and raise age to 21.  Why did you not talk to the NRA about this?  You was kidding about addressing it, huh?
6488 2018-02-23 18:01:56 That makes no sense no on needs bump stocks
6489 2018-02-23 18:01:36 I agree. If you want to own an AR, fine. Bump stocks though should be super illegal. If you want to shoot a gun that fast, go to a range and test it out. No need or reason to have hay on a personal weapon.
6490 2018-02-23 18:01:27 Yesterday my finance professor told us studies show that female investors (whether independent or when it’s their actual job) make more money than men because men are overconfident and believe they will be more successful investing in riskier assets/stocks etc. So like #girlpower
6491 2018-02-23 18:00:53 I didn't realize @KylieJenner had that much power  she brought down Snapchat stocks with one tweetWhat she needs to do I tweet my new Mixtape "Reflection" is dropping Monday 2.26.2018 
6492 2018-02-23 18:00:37 Bump stocks shoot up more ammo, and wear out the gun faster. A win win for gun manufactures and the NRA. Shouldn't mental illness preclude gun ownership? #Paranoia
6493 2018-02-23 18:00:27 Maybe with a bump stock but keeping it on target would be difficult. Bump stocks are a kludge.
6494 2018-02-23 18:00:13 You are going to be disappointingly surprised @Michaelj2207
6495 2018-02-23 18:00:05 Et @zalandofr @VANS_Europe quand vous allez faire le plein des stocks psk ça devient chaud
6496 2018-02-23 17:59:11 Agree bump stocks should go. not sure that age increase would resolve anything. perhaps as part of the background check process we could place more emphasis on mental health component. Also we need answers as to why 30+ complaints were filed against FL shooter without response.
6497 2018-02-23 17:59:02 Bump Stocks as an issue are just an ANOMALY!  Unlike Movie depictions fully auto weapons are RARELY ever seen in violent crime. You can Bump-Fire a semi-auto rifle with your trigger finger locked in your belt loop or shirt pocket. Broken people are the problem not plastic stocks.
6498 2018-02-23 17:58:53 $CHK tanking after beating earnings. Not surprising with this stocks history...let’s see if it can rebound
6499 2018-02-23 17:58:42 Unusually, it doesn't look like gun stocks are rallying post-Florida shooting.
6500 2018-02-23 17:57:50 Why in the heck are you submitting to liberals? You are only ostracizing the other 50% of the country. Stay out of politics. Do you remember what happened to Starbucks and Target? Their stocks dropped significantly. STAYBOUT OF POLITICS!!!! @enterprisecares

6502 2018-02-23 17:57:04 I'm honestly curious: what is the purpose of the stock market other than to be an artifical projection of growth that we then ascribe meaning to?
I'm not versed in econ. But I don't see the harm in an economy without growth. Stocks always seemed like a game the wealthy made up.
6503 2018-02-23 17:56:24 Why I said I could of played it better . Only thing I did right was sell out of 70% of my mmj stocks in early January
6504 2018-02-23 17:56:22 POTUS wants to ban bump stocks, raise the age to 21 to purchase a gun, get tougher on background checks and help the mentally ill. Agree or dis-agree?
6505 2018-02-23 17:56:09 There’s no reason for bump stocks to be legal. Most of these proposed bans don’t pass common sense.. but bump stocks simply are there to make it full auto
6506 2018-02-23 17:56:05 If 3.5% is a good cap on the 30 year, do you like stocks then?
6507 2018-02-23 17:55:56 ECONOMY:  Republicans MUST HAVE STRONG ECONOMY and stock market if they are going to win in 11/18.  GOP PACs are supporting stock market, but looks like foreigners are selling US stocks.  This will be interesting.  Another Bbig decline in stock market will scare the crap of GOP
6508 2018-02-23 17:55:52 i’m wishing all the best for got7’s next comeback because their last one wasnt so great in terms of their album stocks and promotions in all honestly that album was good, its unfortunate jyp didnt pay enough attention to them when they can go much further.
6509 2018-02-23 17:55:51 What about bump stocks?
6510 2018-02-23 17:55:36 Hi Chris, thank you for your wonderful videos, I’ve learned a lot from you. Can you please elaborate what is your opinion about implementing your technical analysis methods on single stocks (straight) and not ETFs? Are you against single stocks?Only ETFs?
Thanks
6511 2018-02-23 17:55:31 Didn't have the guts to address bump stocks or raising age to 21?  You were just trying to peddle bs to the others?
6512 2018-02-23 17:55:17 But we know that the majority of people in prisons don’t follow the law. They buy their guns on the streets, steal them in B&Es , take a family members, etc. The guns that use 1 tigger pull for many rounds are prohibited but they get them anyways, use bump stocks, etc
6513 2018-02-23 17:55:12 @NRA & @realDonaldTrump: And private citizens need bump stocks & semiautomatic weapons why?
6514 2018-02-23 17:54:54 Bump stocks don't make firearms more lethal...
6515 2018-02-23 17:54:47 MARCO   Then why the FCK do ppl buy bump stocks?  Stop kissing the ass of the NRA. I hope your own unemployment insurance is paid up because you’re going to need it.
6516 2018-02-23 17:54:47 But Long term capital gain tax on stocks & mutual fund is not understandable.while buying stocks have to pay nearly 15 percent tax,then why another tax.
6517 2018-02-23 17:54:42 A bunch of people get shot with an AR-15.
"He was a terrorist"
More people get shot with an AR-15.
"Maybe we rethink bump stocks"
Even more people get shot with an AR-15.
"It's mental health"

Guys, I think the problem might be the gun...
6518 2018-02-23 17:54:15 #FF I don't do too many Friday Follows, but to anyone trading energy stocks, add @ZmansEnrgyBrain and check out his site. One of the rare guys on Twitter who is an absolute master of his craft and a truly good guy generous enough to share his time and knowledge.
6519 2018-02-23 17:54:05 After being stunned speechless for a bit, Id say "i had stocks?" Lol
You look amazing!!!
6520 2018-02-23 17:54:01 Hey it’s a start. But how are bump stocks still legal after Vegas? I remember strong talk after that..... then it disappeared???
6521 2018-02-23 17:54:00 I am against any further infringement of my rights, including banning bump stocks.   I would never own a bumps stock, because I think they are crap and a gimmick, but if I wanted one, as a law abiding citizen, I should be able to have one.   NO MORE GUN LAWS!!  Armed guards!!
6522 2018-02-23 17:53:03 There are bills in Congress right now to ban automatic assault weapons and bump stocks and to implement universal background checks. @KenCalvert could urge Paul Ryan to bring them to a vote and then vote yes. But he hasn't, and he won't, because he is an NRA shill and a liar.
6523 2018-02-23 17:52:41 You would think to be transparent that would be the approach to take. Similar to how portfolio managers need to provide certain disclosure when recommending / talking about stocks on TV
6524 2018-02-23 17:52:34 Today, Nifty went 100 points up and to my surprise I see my What'sApp groups flooded with charts of indices, stocks n "maine bola tha bottom bangaya short mat karo", "buy this, that", "this is next multi-bagger"

Last 20 days was all silent and now next 2 days Shaanti bhang hogi.
6525 2018-02-23 17:52:16 Right. Arm people whose incentive is easy money with no questions. In schools. Do you have stocks in funeral parlours or are you really as dumb as your hairdo?
6526 2018-02-23 17:51:14 Btw.. I’m all for strict background checks, raising age to buy AR to 21, and absolutely getting rid of bump stocks.
6527 2018-02-23 17:50:50 With training to conceal and carry in schools. Students parents want to ban assault weapons AR-15 & bump stocks. U can hardly blame them after losing a child raise the age from 18 to 21 w/stricter background checks. Child Trafficking a Worldwide Epidemic.
6528 2018-02-23 17:50:41 Trump-bump stocks? Nooo Sounds too pornographic. Maybe just bump-Trump. As him vote hm away.
6529 2018-02-23 17:50:34 So far bump stocks.... but..... it’s all in the finger. Ppl wanted bump stocks banned. They got it well the process is going on now . But it’s the finger action.
6530 2018-02-23 17:50:33 What's an assault rifle? Plenty of hunting rifles that are semi auto but have wood stocks and don't have rails to attach useless optics but no one calls them assault rifles, when they function just the same.
6531 2018-02-23 17:50:09 Wow with this one tweet Snapchat stocks have fallen by 18 Gorillion percent
6532 2018-02-23 17:50:03 The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre admitted the NRA wrote the foundation bill of the NICS System during C-PAC yesterday and boasted about it. They also supported the 1990 Gun Free Zone Act & ban bump stocks. How do you say you’re protecting the 2nd Amendment?

6538 2018-02-23 17:49:25 Ya I see what you're saying. But the good guy could still just as easily make this.

And if some kid who wants to shoot up his school (not that Cruz used bump stocks) doesn't know how to make one, then it does hurt bad guys.
6539 2018-02-23 17:49:18 Apparently you don't read history then. Bump stocks are not your right and 80% of USA wants them banned.

6541 2018-02-23 17:48:55 We certainly will.  Until then, probably time to go long with FAM stocks; they usually get a bump when there's gun-grabber jibber-jabber.
6542 2018-02-23 17:48:39 We as a nation are laughing stocks to the rest of the world!
6543 2018-02-23 17:48:17 CNN only brought in people w/ their agenda. Censored other voices. Trump sat while these people vented and in some cases yelled at him. Dems did NOTHING while in power. He is supporting NICS bill. Ban bump-stocks. Support mental health. Increase age to buy. Whats wrong w that?
6544 2018-02-23 17:48:07 Not true, The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre admitted the NRA wrote the foundation bill of the NICS System during C-PAC yesterday and boasted about it. They also supported the 1990 Gun Free Zone Act & banning bump stocks. How do you say you’re protecting the 2nd Amendment?
6545 2018-02-23 17:47:31 ~Change law (ban) AR-15 from 18 to 21

~ Pass & fully fund Universal Background Checks

6546 2018-02-23 17:47:16 Gun stocks are up in anticipation of increased sales is not the same as gun sales are already up. But it shows the gun business expects this time to be like the past.
6547 2018-02-23 17:46:53 That teenager should have been on the prohibited list three dozen times by now. Idiot liberal law enforcement refused to proceed.
Vegas shooter turned his rifles into stuttering inaccurate jokes that could only hit a large crowd with any efficacy.
Bump stocks are a joke.
6548 2018-02-23 17:46:52 yea, she’s taken care of me. And idk if I should tell you, you’ve been coming for the Aries lately lol nah but in the education market, after school programs, already have multiple savings. Also, trying to learn about stocks to invest in and starting a business.
6549 2018-02-23 17:46:48 Lmao the bump stocks and high capacity magazines do not kill people.  The person holding the gun does.
6550 2018-02-23 17:46:47 Isn't my first time being in a correction either . Although there seems to be new to alot of people. It's comes with the territory. Just because stocks retraced with marker dosent mean they are pump and dumps. Nodoubt there are many out there. It's why I do tons of research
6551 2018-02-23 17:46:40 I just noted gun stocks went up. My statement was with the understanding that of course we cannot know this specific data. I should have used the term will go up and extremely likely.

6554 2018-02-23 17:46:14 And bump stocks don't increase effectiveness, in the vast majority of situations they decrease effectiveness.

6556 2018-02-23 17:46:03 Banning bump stocks is a gesture to appease gun control advocates more than a genuine move to control gun violence, and it totally elides the reality that an AR15 on its own can cause a massacre.
6557 2018-02-23 17:46:01 Stocks open higher. Dow +140 points.
6558 2018-02-23 17:45:39 C'mon @CNN . He doesn't think arming all teachers is the solution. Maybe 10% that are trained and comfortable. He's also advocating for changes in regards to bump stocks and age. It's a start.
6559 2018-02-23 17:45:33 (minimum) "buying" age banning bump stocks and yet who knew and why didn 't the establishment insisit that Babcock was part and parcel of the agenda that was raised in preceeding trials andyet 57% was too way too much and yet the 43% weren't competent in 'driving' the agenda and
6560 2018-02-23 17:45:22 And the NJ State Board of Administrators....while utilizing former Gov, spouse’s financial investment firm w a half mill a yr salary...to poorly manage the state’s public employee retirement system w stocks in multiple gun companies that have been used to kill school children.
6561 2018-02-23 17:45:21 I support the 2nd Amendment.That does not mean that I am against the banning of Assault Weapons,Bump Stocks,or high-capacity magazines.Nor does it mean that I support the idea that guns should be easy to get,or that guns should be allowed everywhere.What’s w/All or Nothing tude?
6562 2018-02-23 17:45:20 It mostly depends where $SPX dividend yield is. 4-6% with stocks yielding ~1% in aggregate is a lot different than the current environment, and a lot more worrisome forward looking.
6563 2018-02-23 17:45:14 Just saw you get completely shut down by everyone else on your panel after your clarification on regulating bump stocks instead of banning them which ur panel said wasn't true. Please keep trying to get the truth out there instead of BS #Trumpaganda and thank you @trish_regan
6564 2018-02-23 17:45:10 Money can be made in markets. Some sell options, some buy them. Few trade stocks and few futures. Some trade only INDEX. At the end of the day what matters is the P&L. Find your edge, respect risk and trade. Witnessed > 100% returns in matter of hour trading options, loss as well
6565 2018-02-23 17:44:46 Also, why is the discussion of bump stocks still happening, that's one shooting behind. Is that how we'll do this now? We'll solve this shooting's problems after the next one?
6566 2018-02-23 17:44:38 In Florida, the site where the latest school tragedy occurred, teachers expressed frustration that their retirement funds own gun stocks.- Bloomberg News #keepourbabiessafe #strictergunlaws
6567 2018-02-23 17:44:34 He just lowered the restrictions 4 the Mentally ill 2 purchase  a firearm. Today when speaking with reporters not 1 word about increasing age limit or Bump STOCKS, not a WORD!
6568 2018-02-23 17:44:32 Here's the truth, #MAGA folks. Democrats don't want to take away the #2ndAmendment . We don't care if you own a weapon. WE own weapons & we uphold the constitution. We ONLY want gun safety & a ban on bump stocks, assault weapons, full background checks & safety for our children.
6569 2018-02-23 17:44:02 Dear Sir,
Will you suggest few good stocks for long term investment?
6570 2018-02-23 17:43:54 So no banning bump stocks or high capacity mags that have been used to take countless lives in a number of mass shootings?
6571 2018-02-23 17:43:50 @realDonaldTrump is only trying to "act" like he's doing something about guns but he is only satisfying the NRA. More guns is not the answer. Especially in light of a deputy that was there (had a gun) and did nothing. Notice no talk about bump stocks or age restrictions.
6572 2018-02-23 17:43:32 YES...Evil and a complete lie. The only weapons that would be outlawed are the automatic guns and rifles and bump stocks for conversions to that type of weapon.Nothing more than what is needed to kill many innocent people at a time. Stop spreading fear to responsible gun owners!!
6573 2018-02-23 17:43:21 So ban bump stocks & folding/collapsible  stocks & detachable magazines holding more than 5 rounds or at least make them subject to more onerous licensing so that people who want them have to pass psych tests & weapon safe handling tests & have gun safes etc...
6574 2018-02-23 17:43:03 I don’t understand why anyone would think that banning bump stocks would help.  I have used a semi-automatic pistol for target shooting an can empty a 14 round clip in around 14 seconds.  Assult rifles without a bump stock would be the same but more deadly.
6575 2018-02-23 17:43:01 Well and good.  What about purchasing Ammo? Bump stocks? Many 18 year olds have already purchased their AR-15.  Parents may have bought them as Xmas gifts for their kid like the BB guns were years ago.
6576 2018-02-23 17:42:57 After Vegas, the NRAsaid they didn't have a problem with banning bump stocks. And please define "common sense".
6577 2018-02-23 17:42:54 Marie Harf: "I don't understand why the @NRA can't agree to ban bump stocks."
I don't understand why planned parenthood can't agree to ban late term abortions. Hey @outnumbered, why is this useful idiot on your couch? #2A #tcot
6578 2018-02-23 17:42:43 There are many more rapid fire mods than just bump stocks.
6579 2018-02-23 17:42:35 Stocks go up, stocks go down
6580 2018-02-23 17:42:35 So the NRA endorses regulation of bump stocks but Harf argues that's not good enough, they should endorse banning them.

Now why would gun owners distrust the left's rhetoric about not wanting to ban guns?  
#OutNumbered
6581 2018-02-23 17:42:28 Big tobacco has largely been defeated. Once unthinkable. Use GOP’s past messaging techniques against them. Label the NRA and its stooges as the #ProMurderLobby , which is who they really are, and make that stick. This can’t stop at bump stocks, buying ages and school security.
6582 2018-02-23 17:42:21 And bump stocks which make the gun fully automatic.
6583 2018-02-23 17:42:19 Donald Trump needs to  raise the age to 21 to buy, ban AR 15, machine guns, bump stocks and ammo magazines. A gov in Florida has raised the age to purchase a firearm, kids will go to another state to buy one.  GOP is afraid of the NRA because of $$, Nothing will be done.
6584 2018-02-23 17:42:17 Yep, hell is gonna be very crowded!  Perfect place to spend eternity, Bill.  The issue is to ban sale of ARs and bump stocks (used in mass murders) to non-adults and the mentally We adults haven’t done it—maybe our children can....
6585 2018-02-23 17:41:58 Florida governor's plan, 11:54 AM, Gov. Rick Scott responds to Parkland shooting with call to raise minimum age to buy firearms to 21, toughen background checks and ban bump stocks
6586 2018-02-23 17:41:43 My impression of the current Conventional Wisdom: Bump stocks are dead, raising the age to 21 to match handguns is lively, and restricting magazine capacity to 10 (as in some states) is likely.
6587 2018-02-23 17:41:40 AR-15s are big boy toys. They are fun to shoot. But, you don’t need an assault rifle, high capacity magazines or bump stocks to defend yourself (or for hunting)
6588 2018-02-23 17:41:36 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 
Machine guns outlawed, they're for Military only!
I think antidepressants need to be looked at MORE CLOSELY!
FBI, look at things MORE CLOSELY & ACCURATELY!
NO BUMP STOCKS! NO GHOST GUNS! EXECUTIVE ORDER!
School security personnel TRAINED!
6589 2018-02-23 17:41:21 While it's true that Hitler used these tactics he banned guns then we had the Holocaust  Trump is actually trying to do the same thing Obama said and using the same words plus Banning bump stocks none of this is going to prevent what happened just an attack on 2nd Amed
6590 2018-02-23 17:41:15 You seem more concerned with bump stocks and eroding those constitutional rights. Are you talking about a wall to regain the conservative support you lost this week?
6591 2018-02-23 17:41:10 How about banning assault style weapons and bump stocks and supporting funding for mental health counseling?
6592 2018-02-23 17:41:01 But they are precise man killers with bullets that pierce armor and are unnecessary to be on the market because these are the exact reasons the killers choose them over a Glock or a regular shot gun Why arent bump stocks illegal
Rubio STOP spinning & protect our children already
6593 2018-02-23 17:41:00 .@OutnumberedFNC Why should bump stocks be banned, not regulated? Machine guns are regulated, not banned. Sloppy obfuscation & inaccurate language (eg "high magazine clips") discourage rational discussion & show unwillingness to compromise (if we even should compromise on rights)
6594 2018-02-23 17:40:06 $Fat bottom .45 we re-set how many times did we see this happen ? It's a flush which anyone hates to see. $ime bottom .27. When the fundamentals comes to play the shareprice will reflect that . Sure i could of played both stocks he'll of alot better.
6595 2018-02-23 17:39:38 The orders of Babylon, the stocks of buried money, the shares of idol companies, the practices of economic destroyers. Ghosts of hosts.
6596 2018-02-23 17:38:54 Remember when gun grabbers screamed about Uzi's because they were a machine gun? The ones imported into America were semi auto but that didn't matter to the gun grabbers.  Then it was rifles with folding stocks and biped legs.  Now it's a rifle that shots a small .223 round.
6597 2018-02-23 17:38:48 Sadly you are correct.  Any talk of gun bans and reforms seem to drive up sales.  The sale of bump stocks is the most recent example.
6598 2018-02-23 17:38:41 @marieharf on @OutnumberedFNC Should avoid arguments like "...why can't the NRA go all on on bump stocks..."   Because the Dems don't go all in on things like banning late term abortion.  We all are for ending the KILLING of babies right?  Right?
6599 2018-02-23 17:38:29 Right now.........yes RIGHT NOW @ 12:37 Eastern Time, this woman is sitting on FOX lying her ass off about the NRA & their position on bump stocks. Seems lying is what she does best. @SandraSmithFox called her on it, then just looked down in disgust.
6600 2018-02-23 17:38:28 Back then bump stocks didn't exist. Neither did automatic machine guns. But the 2nd amendment gave the right to bear arms with any weapon available at the time. 

Technically everything now too should be a right to prevent government tyranny.
6601 2018-02-23 17:38:17 And most of his high conviction stocks are duds/ wrong timing...stopped taking him seriously a long time back..
6602 2018-02-23 17:38:01 crap automatic rifles are already illegal, it's already illegal for mentally ill to purchase firearms. Bump stocks soon to be outlawed,  what next?
6603 2018-02-23 17:37:56 And Bump Stocks should be "Trump Bumps"
6604 2018-02-23 17:37:52 Van de Kamp proposed outside the doctor's waiting room in Scarsdale:  tighter gun restrictions in wake of massive and I mean massive ones that includes raising minimum buying age banning bump stocks and he coopted it from Diana but he had to go to bed with her when her husband
6605 2018-02-23 17:37:44 If dems can get one thing banned as far as firearms, bump stocks or ammo. That will be just the beginning. Remember removing the 10 commandments from our schools? Now see where we are. Slowly they take our freedoms.
6606 2018-02-23 17:37:28 Guess belief that folding stocks were less about hunting/target practice; more about concealment with corrupt intent.
I concede the effects described in article more to do with the ammunition than the gun.
We need to ignore manufacturer's propaganda and make rational policy.
6607 2018-02-23 17:36:47 You have good honest advice on things and do make some good call outs on stocks and I am still learning and trying to learn from people who are honest with their information ..thank you
6608 2018-02-23 17:36:29 CNN didn’t provide details of Pharmaceutical lobbying of $254 million (Opioid deaths 33,000) or Healthcare companies $150 million (stocks have quadrupled under the ACA)
6609 2018-02-23 17:36:27 So when will stocks decouple from the coin?
6610 2018-02-23 17:36:11 Jeff gundlach must be watching your videos.  He says if you want to know where stocks are going, watch bitcoin”
6611 2018-02-23 17:36:08 Teacher pension, 401k, 457, blue chip stocks. Set for retirement next year.
This is my fun money....
6612 2018-02-23 17:36:08 And yet stocks Keep rising...
6613 2018-02-23 17:35:53 If The President gets Higher age requirements, more detailed background checks, eliminates Bump stocks - He would accomplish more than all other previous administrations.
6614 2018-02-23 17:35:50 Bump stocks do nothing you have to have a trigger finger. What about service people they are younger than 21. Secure our schools. Revoke gun free zones. Armed security for our precious children.
6615 2018-02-23 17:35:24 students expelled from schools 4 threats 2 students or themselves evaluation by professionals raise age 4 the ar outlaw stocks
6616 2018-02-23 17:35:17 Bitcoin topped before stocks exactly once, so now people are using that as an indicator for future stock price #voodoo
6617 2018-02-23 17:35:04 Fuck this guy, pass concealed carry reciprocity, pass the SHARE act, move the age to buy pistols to 18, leave bump stocks the way they are, and what the fuck is a "gun violence restraining order?" Enforce the laws that are already on the books.
6618 2018-02-23 17:34:58 Italy?  if so this is a step to enable access to strategic gas stocks to avoid emergency
6619 2018-02-23 17:34:56 Bump stocks are a gimmick. No serious #gun owner would use one. We can make our semi autos full auto with a Dremel tool. #Outnumbered
6620 2018-02-23 17:34:08 AR15s use a .223 caliber round, same as a lot of hunting rifles. AR15s are used often when hunting small rodents or deer. Bump stocks should be illegal, other modifications shouldn't be. Putting a scope on a hunting rifle is considered a modification.
6621 2018-02-23 17:34:00 Gundlach is correct, Bitcoin helped bottom stocks and then helped top them on this last leg. I was planning on discussing this in next Video
6622 2018-02-23 17:33:31 Yes they are, and they're fully legal. Drums and bump stocks can turn a low-caliber AR-15 into a machine that can cut an entire crowd in half.
6623 2018-02-23 17:33:15 Kylie Jenner posted about how she hates the new snap update and their stocks went down. I strive to be on that level
6624 2018-02-23 17:33:01 If I understand things correctly, if the bump stocks are banned, then hunting rifles can't automatically fire off a barrage of bullets. Still a threat, but probabilities of catastrophic massacre are lessened. Am I right?
6625 2018-02-23 17:32:35 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
6626 2018-02-23 17:32:06 BUT BUT BUT banning bump stocks in FL won't mean doodly, if they can be purchased in AL or GA or MS or TX....
6627 2018-02-23 17:32:03 Building blocks, hit rocks, rise stocks, penetrate locks. Rise, I say... look beyond ur worse day... b what it may. Leave or stay, ur shadow will follow. Encouraging ur to wallow in a sea of self pity. Embrace, then erase the mountain top Rock by rock
6628 2018-02-23 17:31:57 Things that should make a comeback: first try Fridays, stranded calling Dave a pussy, 5 stocks, starburst hard candy 

Things that should die off: birra, compendiums, ruining events to prove a point and be a dickhead, protecting the weak, mosquitoes
6629 2018-02-23 17:30:19 Healthcare for ALL = Improving mental health
No private sales -> go through licensed dealer
Robust & ubiquitous background checks
Register/license/regulate all semi-auto rifles like machine guns
Register all gun purchases
Mandatory report all stolen guns
No bump stocks
6630 2018-02-23 17:30:12 Hi, I see you collect A LOT of money from the NRA. My friends and colleagues will NOT be voting for you this November. Unacceptable. Speak out about gun reform and banning bump stocks and the AR-15 unless you want the new generation to VOTE YOU OUT.
6631 2018-02-23 17:30:06 Gouverneur Florida kondigt nieuwe maatregelen aan. 
-$450 miljoen voor veiligheid scholen
- Verbod op ‘bump stocks’
- Strenger antecedentenonderzoek
- Wapenverbod voor mensen met psysische stoornis of gewelddadig verleden
- Verhoging minimumleeftijd naar 21 voor aanschaf AR-15
6632 2018-02-23 17:30:05 1)FLGovRickScott revealed a $500million plan to boost school security that would, among other things, bar "violent or mentally ill" persons from purchasing weapons.
Persons under the age of 21 would also be prohibited from buying guns&bump stocks would be outlawed, Scott said.
6633 2018-02-23 17:29:57 I want all semi-automatic weapons banned, also high capacity magazines and bump stocks. And, while we're at it, ownership of armor piercing bullets should be illegal!  #GunControlNow
6634 2018-02-23 17:29:43 Ok, if Trump bans bump stocks, raises age to obtain a weapon and strengths background checks, I will be somewhat satisfied. Don't mistake this statement, it's not enough in my opinion but it's a start. And I must add, getting a republican to take these actions is a huge step.
6635 2018-02-23 17:29:39 Steam is building up behind new age restrictions on buy an AR15. We have to fight!!!! Not good enough! Ban on ALL assault rifles. Ban on extended clips!! Ban on bump stocks. For goodness sake!!
6636 2018-02-23 17:29:33 can you just tell the team who stocks that these jeans always run out and take forever to get restocked
6637 2018-02-23 17:29:30 Fine with me. But if someone wants a 100rd drum they can still get one. Bump Stocks are stupid and only for yelling yahoo! They serve no purpose and make the gun impossible to control. But if someone wants one a factory in China will be pumping them out.
6638 2018-02-23 17:29:29 Ready for pick up @Timtim store molave
Limited stocks only!!!!
6639 2018-02-23 17:29:26 For example let’s take @ABC  .  They have @GStephanopoulos who was an ex Clinton cabinet operative, who donated to the @ClintonFdn.  He is now an “anchor”.  @ABC had a reporter who lied about the Russian collusion story and stocks plummeted and was reprimanded with leave.
6640 2018-02-23 17:29:23 Same with ammo and bump stocks i bet if i looked at gunbroker...always happens after every shooting
6641 2018-02-23 17:29:04 Making an AR15 fully automatic is not that hard. Bump stock restrictions will not change the incredible level of damage an AR 15 can be used for. Using a restriction of bump stocks to try to make Americans AND NRA happy is not a responsible solution to US murders with AR 15's.
6642 2018-02-23 17:28:54 That poll is actually after he talked to those kids and teachers and told them he would raise the gun purchase age, ban bump stocks and back universal background checks ... it will drop after today’s speech though, you are right.
6643 2018-02-23 17:28:45 Ban high magazine cartridges, bump stocks, all semi and fully automatic weapons, make it illegal to purchase produce or sell any the above products. Improved background checks .
6644 2018-02-23 17:28:38 AN AR-15 IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON!!!! 
Even with a bump stock it is not automatic. 
I do agree bump stocks should be banned because it allows for rapid cycling of the semi-auto function of the AR style weapons.

6647 2018-02-23 17:27:20 Trump is outlawing bump stocks and coming after the guns !
6648 2018-02-23 17:26:22 They’re fun to shoot. You can purchase different things like sights, grips, stocks for them, etc. It’s no different in principle than someone owing a car that they modify. Shooting a hunting rifle and shooting an assault riffles are two very different experiences.

6653 2018-02-23 17:25:50 Many times over the years the news has said "stocks are down due to a rise in oil prices" and the next day they say "Stocks are up, led by oil companies riding a wave of higher oil prices."

6655 2018-02-23 17:25:40 Good point, but you don’t NEED an AR for hunting. And the attachment options can include bump stocks which increase lethality a lot.
6656 2018-02-23 17:25:37 This stocks have lots of internal issues, even unable to publish last two quarters results. It will touch 130 in short term definitely.
6657 2018-02-23 17:25:05 $clr OK that maybe very true, but like stocks that's why you have a diversified portfolio of properties and Harold made it a point of saying that Bakken was turning into the real winner here, especially with lower pipeline costs.

This was predatory algo's not Stack issues
6658 2018-02-23 17:25:03 People, DO NOT rush and give Rick Scott credit for pushing to raise the age limit to 21 for purchase of long guns and bump stocks ... IT DOES NOTHING about private sales where there are literally -0- restrictions
6659 2018-02-23 17:24:53 I bet you just loaded up on gun and ammunition stocks. So you artificially inflate the price with all the gun grabber talk.

6661 2018-02-23 17:24:44 #floridagov governor Rick Scott hit major keys in the press conference today. With armed guards at the schools. Having it where the mental ill can’t own a gun. Banning bump stocks. Upping  the age to 21. But in my personal if a 18 year can be military. Then they can own a gun
6662 2018-02-23 17:24:30 I'm not advocating banning all guns but I would like to see background checks, a database of people who should not have guns, a ban on bump stocks and regulation on the assault type rifles.
6663 2018-02-23 17:24:28 Another GOP POS ...  no ban on bump stocks.

6676 2018-02-23 17:21:50 Also, bump stocks are inconvenient, and waste ammo. Rarely even used by people. Background checks are already extensive. These won't punish any AR owner, but a ban on semi-automatic rifles would punish the entire nation. When the 2A is destroyed, all other freedoms will be gone.
6677 2018-02-23 17:21:31 One tweet from the daughter of a famous family (who are all useless humans) has caused stocks for a famous App to drop instantly.....this future generation certainly is an interesting one
6678 2018-02-23 17:21:21 3D Systems Corp (DDD) up 1.7% 10.16 per share #stocks
6679 2018-02-23 17:21:21 Why is the response to the Florida shooting to ban bump stocks when there aren’t reports that the shooter used one?
6680 2018-02-23 17:21:05 You tarde stocks. I assume you trust nobody, otherwise you wouldn’t make money. So why would you let anyone armed with a gun hang around your child. Schools protected by law enforcement: yes. Armed teachers: no.
6681 2018-02-23 17:21:05 Wonder how much of big drop in gold stocks versus gold reflects declining reserves?
6682 2018-02-23 17:20:59 No, they just refuse to be part of the solution, pushing back against raising the age to buy weapons, any restrictions on the sale of weapons by type and purpose, and in fact will not even supporting making bump stocks illegal.
6683 2018-02-23 17:20:55 I believe machine guns/automatic weapons are still illegal. It's large-magazine semi-automatic weapons that are behind most of the mass killings, sometimes using bump stocks.
6684 2018-02-23 17:20:49 Elliot waves are a match made in heaven to crypto. No buy out, missed earnings, or bankruptcy news can immensely disrupt the wave.  Fundamentals still do apply but not much as it is in stocks.
6685 2018-02-23 17:20:36 Sen. Bill Galvano: GOP plan includes increasing the age limit for buying weapons from 18 to 21, including include law enforcement and military, a three-day waiting period and a ban on bump stocks.
6686 2018-02-23 17:20:23 I hope NOT(I pray Homebuilding stocks continue downward)..!!
6687 2018-02-23 17:20:01 I understand Trump is not the most noble man to hold the position. However, name a president that was and I will find at least 2 things to discount it. Trump seems like he is sincere in the direction. Maybe he can pass the legislation to ban the bump stocks and strict gun laws.
6688 2018-02-23 17:19:58 The media was unable to connect the Las Vegas' shooters motives (which are still unknown) to support of Trump or white supremacy, so discussion briefly sparked about bump stocks, but then stopped.
6689 2018-02-23 17:19:57 And on the 7th day God created 'bump stocks'
6690 2018-02-23 17:19:49 And I'd like to target weapons that are modified for superior rates of fire, myself. Bump stocks, binary triggers, etc.
6691 2018-02-23 17:19:34 Is the cost of bringing up kids going through the roof?

Is that why most people now have just 1 kid?

Is that why condom cos stocks are zooming ?

Last week skore (ttk health)..today cupid.

Is there a story..ki topi pehna rahe hain??
6692 2018-02-23 17:19:32 A complete ban on bump stocks, enhance restrictions on people who have been Baker Acted, @BillGalvano continues.
6693 2018-02-23 17:19:15 SO much for LISTENING to the youth and the Nation
DT siding with NRA with lame excuses
not with the American People who overwhelmingly want
banning of military stye weapon+bumplike stocks !!!
DT LIES AGAIN
6694 2018-02-23 17:19:15 .@BillGalvano: ban bump stocks. Anyone who has been adjudicated as mentally defective cannot own guns. Now they just can’t purchase.
6695 2018-02-23 17:19:13 Corporations this year buying back their stocks at record high valuations is going to go down as one of the biggest blunders in history.
6696 2018-02-23 17:19:12 .@BillGalvano "the first component is firearm safety... we will increase the minimum age for purchasing a firearm to 21 years" with exceptions for military and law enforcement. Also proposing three day waiting limit for purchase of firearms. Complete ban of bump stocks.
6697 2018-02-23 17:18:57 But what they do is use recoil from weapon to let your finger pull trigger faster and it’s alllll over the internet now complete with very simple instructions for making one. Thanks to the media for publicizing bump stocks
6698 2018-02-23 17:18:56 .@BillGalvano runs through the Legislature’s plan: raising age for purchasing any firearm to 21, 3-day waiting period for all without concealed carry permits or hunting course, ban on bump stocks.
6699 2018-02-23 17:18:49 Florida Legislature also calling for raising age of persons purchasing firearms to 21, 3-day waiting limit and complete ban of bump stocks.
6700 2018-02-23 17:18:22 Fl house/senate- First component:
- new restrictions on purchase of all firearms minimum age 21 - 3 day waiting period with some exceptions - complete ban of bump stocks
6701 2018-02-23 17:18:19 Spoon feeding, er timing, not my forte Luke. Sept/Oct typically worst months for stocks and pre #Midterms. Removal of QE punchbowl by higher interest rates and balance sheet reductions will break the equity markets back imho.
6702 2018-02-23 17:18:11 $nf.c still no update to shareholders  @newagefarminc #shareholders continue to sell off shares of new age Farms as SP price continues to fall and shareholders lose faith

6703 2018-02-23 17:18:01 Also said he would have bump stocks banned (it's a shooting technique not a gun itself)
6704 2018-02-23 17:17:52 Obama’s “fast & furious” was more deadly than bump stocks
6705 2018-02-23 17:17:50 I love Mr wonderful, but he made the same argument about nflx and amzn 20 months ago...different kinds of stocks/companies
6706 2018-02-23 17:17:21 U think stocks finally going to break these levels? Up or down?
6707 2018-02-23 17:17:11 No bump stocks makes a difference in Vegas for sure. But it’s a start. Orlando shooter was on FBI radar. Can’t stand pat.
6708 2018-02-23 17:16:51 “Unshakeable” is a very important book for any investor to read (or listen to on Audible like I did / do). Helped me understand there’s a difference between being lazy, and not doing extra work that’s completely unnecessary (like checking how your stocks are doing all the time).
6709 2018-02-23 17:16:40 Stocks in play: $LPNT $MIC $SYNH #stocks #DayTrading
6710 2018-02-23 17:16:40 Plus banning bump stocks...Lots oh pi$$ed moms = LOTS of pressure!
6711 2018-02-23 17:15:43 I'm still not sure some fully appreciate what happened. The defining trade of the last 24 months was completely WIPED OUT. And days later, the stocks that matter - AMZN, AAPL, JPM, GOOGL - started to rally without even a hiccup along the way. No contagion. Back to, "as you were"
6712 2018-02-23 17:15:28 We don't have to give up 2A rights, but we don't need high-capacity mags, bump-stocks, 18 year-olds buying military-style rifles, lax background checks, lax training, no mandatory trigger locks, unlicensed sales, lax regs that allow guns to cross state lines, etc.
6713 2018-02-23 17:15:15 The amount of poor, misleading and cookie-cutter type information that is out there and which many retail investors buy into is absolutely shocking #stocks
6714 2018-02-23 17:14:55 Hi-Im pro 2a & believe no bump stocks 21 age limit &banning AR type at least or until there is training licensing & insurance i believe I am honest rational & logical & as college professor I (even tho trained w guns & very comfortable around them) dontwant 2carry a gun on campus
6715 2018-02-23 17:14:49 The NRA is on board with bump stocks and automatic weapons and as of last week they want legislation to prevent people convict of domestic violence to have approval from current and past spouses. And anyone with a felony is already out. So what else is there?
6716 2018-02-23 17:14:07 I support:
-banning bump stocks 
-raising age to buy rifles to 21
-expanded background checks
-no fly list ban (with appeal process available)
-mentally unstable can’t have guns
-better communication between law enforcement agencies

I oppose:
-banning semi automatic rifles
6717 2018-02-23 17:13:52 The best way to end a week is with a dividend increase from one of your stocks. Thanks for the raise today $RY :)
6718 2018-02-23 17:13:45 Let’s see if this is actually placed into law. I don’t believe a damn thing he says. Just two days ago he was cowering under his desk and now he wants to ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21? I will believe it when it happens. #ParklandStudentsSpeak #NeverAgain

6720 2018-02-23 17:13:37 Do not let the age of 21, stronger background checks & banned bump stocks be considered a win.  If you accept this and stand down, you are going back to 1994 when most of this had became law (repealed in 2004).
Don't go back 24 yrs.
Everything has to change!

6721 2018-02-23 17:13:31 I hope most people are practical enough to come together and find a solution for the sake of our kids. Extremists keep us from making meaningful progress. If we could be REASONABLE and PRACTICAL that would make a huge difference.  Banning semi-autos is neither.  Bump stocks yes.
6722 2018-02-23 17:13:26 Try my newsletter, which this week is titled "Stocks will fluctuate."
6723 2018-02-23 17:13:03 Fight for the ban on high capacity magazines. This will make bump stocks useless, and prevent all guns, even pistols, from firing off more than 5 or 6 bullets per round.
6724 2018-02-23 17:13:00 The fact remains that our children are dying in school and no matter what you believe as far as this should be handled the fact remainsas that something does need to be done rather it's outlawing bump stocks or moving the age to purchase a firearm to 21
6725 2018-02-23 17:12:51 Not likely the bump stocks in the Fl legislature will be buying what Scott is selling
6726 2018-02-23 17:12:43 ...at least. Naz now down 7.2% off the hi. I am not the owner of a crystal ball, but when you use fact and historical precedent, and not opinion and prediction, i.e. the O'Neil approach, you don't have to have one #stocks
6727 2018-02-23 17:12:22 I do not pay attention to the O'Neil follow-through day concept unless there is at least an 8% correction off the hi. Common sense tells you that it will become less useful the smaller the pullback. My line has always been 8%... #stocks
6728 2018-02-23 17:11:56 @WXYZPrakash The President DID NOT sign ANY legistragion banning ANY 'bump stocks' as you reported. Who ever made up this story should be fired!!
6729 2018-02-23 17:11:50 I never view a correction as negative. It spells o-p-p-o-r-t-u-n-i-t-y. It is what makes it possible for things to re-set and keep people honest #stocks
6730 2018-02-23 17:11:40 Ok je comprends bien mais le problème vient surtout du fait que vous affichez des stocks qui semblent faux. Un gentil technicien m'a aidé via irc. Merci à vous.
6731 2018-02-23 17:11:39 the NRA gave away free memberships when obama first got elected so i got one ironically so while i’m literally a card carrying member of the NRA i definitely think semi automatic rifles / bump stocks / high capacity magazines should be illegal

6736 2018-02-23 17:10:47 You can begin to see a nascent defensive segment, w/ all four sectors agreeing; subtle, but it is there. Very classic, mature bull-market behavior #stocks
6737 2018-02-23 17:10:36 It is heartening to see riskier segments like Nasdaq Comp and the liquid glamours outperform slightly the past two days. Naz has outperformed five of last six sessions. This is the unexpected, and thus deserves our attention #stocks
6738 2018-02-23 17:10:35 Of course there's a good reason. Some of my mutual funds include pharma stocks.
6739 2018-02-23 17:10:32 When Reagan was shot with a pistol the government banned scary looking “assault weapons”. Now a lunatic shoots 17 with an AR and @FLGovScott wants to ban bump stocks.  Why is it the target of the ban is never related to the tool used or the person who committed the crime?

6744 2018-02-23 17:10:19 I have been around hunting and guns my entire life.  There are ways to respect gun owners & be a lot safer.  Minimum age to purchase to 21, tougher background checks, 90 day waiting period, outlaw bump stocks, mandatory for a gun safety class to be taken before any gun purchases.
6745 2018-02-23 17:10:11 Donald trump wants to get rid of the bump stocks, raise the age to purchase a gun, arm qualified teachers (much needed) and improve the background system and address mental cases, and Senator Blumenthal thinks republicans won't make concessions, sorry senator you are sad.
6746 2018-02-23 17:10:08 3.  As far as general gun crime, I believe there is reason to believe that enhanced background checks, elimination of bump stocks, etc. will have little overall impact. Legislation may have some implication for Rampage Shootings at schools.  But it's nipping at the margins.
6747 2018-02-23 17:10:07 RT ReutersUS: MORE: Scott plans to completely ban purchase or sale in Florida of bump stocks
6748 2018-02-23 17:10:07 It's a step, but not enough. He didn't use bump stocks and people over 21 can still get these weapons of war. Ban assault weapons now! Keep up the pressure kids, you're making a difference!
6749 2018-02-23 17:10:05 Dems gave us gun free zones and bump stocks !!!
6750 2018-02-23 17:09:56 We do need to create a culture which values human life & dignity, not by arming teachers but by restricting access to semi automatic weapons, 30+ round banana clips, unlimited ammo, bump stocks and more.
6751 2018-02-23 17:09:40 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX bottom signal appears to be complete, but a poor completion it is, even for a late stage bottom. No trade. May go long on a pullback.

And fuck up stocks just because I can
6753 2018-02-23 17:09:19 He's right, and if agencies actually do their job such as reporting to update the system that is already in place. NO BUMP STOCKS
6754 2018-02-23 17:09:16 AR-15s are NOT assault rifles and bump stocks do not turn a weapon in to a machine gun.  A belt loop can accomplish the same as a bump stock.  But yes, the NRA are working hard for the rights of Americans.
6755 2018-02-23 17:09:07 Only a few irresponsible owners? And yet a toddler is shooting weekly and criminals are stealing at alarming rates? How exactly do better background checks, bans on bump stocks, etc. punish you? You might have to wait longer?
6756 2018-02-23 17:08:32 They won't mate. States rights and congress would never pass a full ban. We'll see expanded background checks and bans on bump stocks and or magazine sizes at most

#Stocks #Junk #Pigs
6764 2018-02-23 17:08:04 Ban assault weapon sales.  No bump stocks.  Thorough background checks like need wait times in all states. Registry of all gun owners and sales with annual review.  For a sale require dr letter, interview and =>letter of reference from community member. Proof of need.
6765 2018-02-23 17:07:59 You should be drug screened and automatic weapons and bump stocks banned.
6766 2018-02-23 17:07:51 And by the GOP you are referring to “the party of personal accountability”? What a group of reprobate hypocrites. They are stumbling around blindly imploding their party as they become unanimous in being jokes and laughing stocks.
6767 2018-02-23 17:07:39 #Russia Presidential election was a warmup.  Imagine the chaos when 350 million Russian bots using stolen identities and passwords sell stocks short, empty bank accounts, and order everything on every on-line retailing website.  Only drug dealers will have enough cash.
6768 2018-02-23 17:07:30 Good start, these kids are making a difference, but it's not enough and they must keep the pressure on them. He didn't use bump stocks in Parkland and people over 21 can still get these weapons of war. An assault weapons ban is an absolute must.
6769 2018-02-23 17:06:59 I can’t agree more that is beyond true what is his problem. He’s still trying to protect the NRA while saying I’ll lower the age and ban bump stocks he sounds crazy it’s CONCEALED! Crazy crazy
6770 2018-02-23 17:06:33 I am dealing w/ settled jurisprudence, be it substantive or procedural. We have nothing 2 discus until you point out just where in Constitution or SCOTUS decisions semi-automatic, automatic weapons, bump stocks, high velocity ammunition,large magazines are specifically protected
6771 2018-02-23 17:06:21 Well florida gov NRA member Rick Scott just announced banning under 21 year olds from assault weapons and banning bump stocks.
6772 2018-02-23 17:06:17 That's comforting to know. The latest mass shooter (has there been another yet?) wasn't old enough to buy a drink but yet was fine to buy a semi-automatic rifle. Bump stocks that turn weapons into machine guns make perfect sense too.
6773 2018-02-23 17:06:16 How about banning ownership of bump stocks? These half hearted attempts at "reform" are only meant to silence people.
6774 2018-02-23 17:06:13 The most fascinating thing about this bull mkt is that growth stocks are not giving it up as they normally would in a mature bull. This says that large investors are finding the explosive earnings estimates, in tech mainly, are too big to pass up, even w/ the... #stocks
6775 2018-02-23 17:06:12 So prime examples of the slaughter-enabling NRA speaking up for gun safety are thoroughly elastic gun laws and weapons of war on our streets. Oh, and those bump stocks. And no waiting periods. And no regulation at gun shows.
6776 2018-02-23 17:05:57 A NRA recipient that isn't going far enough. This problem goes beyond age restrictions, bump stocks, assault weapons bans and background checks. We need to raise our children to not belittle, make fun of, or disrespect others. Isolation and exclusion is another issue to address
6777 2018-02-23 17:05:52 $MTCH (contd): If you look at the fundamentals, just what does it have going for it? Junky earnings growth in recent qtrs.....ahh, but the estimates of 83%/23% for '18/'19 #stocks
6778 2018-02-23 17:05:43 Yes, how stupid we liberals are to think everything is a machine gun - let's ignore the numerous LEGAL modifications like bump stocks and echo triggers, which serve NO OTHER PURPOSE but to give a gun owner the power to slaughter an entire roomful of people.
6779 2018-02-23 17:05:35 divergence occurred w/ the avgs, numerous stocks also signaled, e.g. $AAPL at 158, $SQ, $NFLX, etc...btw, nice catch on $QURE (another divergence)
6780 2018-02-23 17:05:32 Agree with everthing except 21 and bump stocks ...... Only 1 shooting has had bumpstocks and i would only increase the age lmit too 19 because female in collage need guns to protect themselves think about it trump
6781 2018-02-23 17:05:30 I take everything coming out of DC with a big grain of salt...from both parties. I do think he will act on the bump-stocks now...it’s low hanging fruit and not fundamental to the 2A
6782 2018-02-23 17:05:25 Mister governor I just wanted to say this to you raising the minimum age to buy guns is all well and good but why not remove military grade weapons from the gun stores I remove the ability to buy the bump stocks for them and remove the ammo for them@FLGovScott
6783 2018-02-23 17:05:16 Will be a green stocks Friday today? By looking at some stuff around...
6784 2018-02-23 17:05:06 Institutions do not look at trailing, they look at forward p/e. I think this is still the mkt pricing in the tax cut, technology especially, b/c capex can now be expensed not capitalized - major difference - and tech is considered capital goods #stocks
6785 2018-02-23 17:05:00 Bump stocks have been the NRA's sac lamb for a while. It's doing nothing and making it look like he's doing something.
6786 2018-02-23 17:04:55 Criminals will still get bump stocks. Did a ban stop our drug epidemic? Stupid laws like this leave law abiders vulnerable to the lawless.
6787 2018-02-23 17:04:50 Most of the breakouts have been from 3week v-shaped shelves, not 5-8week bases. This has frustrated by-the-book players who only enter a proper base breakout. $TAL is one such actor, sets up in a 4month base, 1% from pivot #stocks
6788 2018-02-23 17:04:44 Why isn't anyone going after the FBI?  What about the past shooters that all had some sort of depression / mental issue and were on medications?  Therres allot more going on besides bump-stocks.  What did Obama do in regards to the same situation?
6789 2018-02-23 17:04:29 The only AI name i am aware of is $NVDA. Not sure of IoT. But the point is that the cream rises to the top. And if you are looking at numerous charts, the big innovators will stand out, saving you time in the research process. #stocks

6792 2018-02-23 17:04:15 Especially the end of bump stocks, those are the mods that make a semi a fully auto. I do think he should pull a bill Clinton and end the sale on assault rifles as well (Clinton’s lasted for 10 years)
6793 2018-02-23 17:03:59 Why are (some) Republicans suddenly coming out against bump stocks after the Florida shooting? It wasn't used in the Florida shooting. It was used in the LAS VEGAS shooting, but there wasn't this extended outrage after THAT one. Always fighting the LAST battle. PR over principle.
6794 2018-02-23 17:03:58 No one should be surprised if the avgs drop down to test their 2/9 low. Not a forecast, but a scenario that may have been overlooked due to the stout performance of many growth stocks #stocks
6795 2018-02-23 17:03:56 Yes, nominal bull markets in stocks can happen when inflation and nominal rates rise, e.g. Venezuela has the best performing stock market in the world... in nominal terms. But this isn't what happened in the 1970s when stocks went nowhere and lost 50% of real value.
6796 2018-02-23 17:03:28 Of the last 30 years' worth of Nasdaq sell-offs, more than 75% of them contained some form of successful test - or series of tests - of the initial low. This has not occurred yet #stocks
6797 2018-02-23 17:03:28 That's a good start but not nearly enough. He didn't use bump stocks in Parkland. People over 21 can still get these ridiculous weapons of war. Like I said, it's a start, but it's not enough if you don't ban the assault weapons as well.
6798 2018-02-23 17:03:25 $GILD is a long term holding in my portfolio and I am getting tired to see that it stays where it is... In the charts I dont see b/o , anyone has any thoughts?
6799 2018-02-23 17:03:24 MORE: Gov. action plan includes: banning sale of bump stocks, one deputy for every one thousand students, metal detectors, steel doors, and mandatory active shooter drills every semester. @WPBF25News #MSDStrong #MSD

6802 2018-02-23 17:03:00 And after four months of silence the neocons are throwing us a bone with their calls to ban bump stocks. I still don’t know why those are legal in a country that outlaws automatic weapons.
6803 2018-02-23 17:02:56 I would be less interested in running after the train leaving the station and more interested in waiting for the next one #stocks
6804 2018-02-23 17:02:54 It's not really fair, actually.  Haha.  These people are used to betting on common stocks of companies that only care about growth and EPS.  

This realm is going to fucking slaughter them in the end, because they can't see the USE for these tokens.  They just like betting it. 
6805 2018-02-23 17:02:49 Furthermore, I've been reading all of these tweets about the school shootings, vs driving and war. These people have lost sight of what the bump stocks, and age limit is for long guns. Thanks for taking time to read these.
6806 2018-02-23 17:02:38 Bump stocks had no place in this tragedy. Outlaw the military style weapons for sale to private citizens. These guns have one purpose. You don’t see our military carrying around a 6 shot 12 gauge do you. That is what I used to hunt.

6812 2018-02-23 17:01:11 @DLoesch hey Dana if the NRA’s position has been than bump stocks should be banned then why did it oppose legislation back in November than would have banned bump stocks? #NeverEnough
6813 2018-02-23 17:00:56 I hear ya!

Initially (yrs ago) was guilty of this too. Would buy stocks of co’s I loved for their products and not thinking re entry, re-entry & exit points.

Liking $THCX for its low BS more work strategy, but it needs to up the ante on its branding. More focus on IR, PR, ADV.
6814 2018-02-23 17:00:49 If people are responsible gun owners, they would give up their bump stocks. Because lives matter more than a piece of metal.
6815 2018-02-23 17:00:45 Write more disclaimers of your other stocks.
6816 2018-02-23 17:00:37 Sigh. Ya but bump stocks only maximize fire by about 2-4x you can do w/ semi. Fully auto military weapons 10-20x are meant to fire in bursts, a lot like semi in order to re-aim. Vegas could fire consistently bc of a large target and even he stopped to re-aim at times.
6817 2018-02-23 17:00:29 And obviously, lots of guns out there are like that. And even if bump stocks became illegal people would still use them if their goal is to kill people. I think that AR’s should not be this easy to get, but if they’re for hunting then it’s fine if you have a license.
6818 2018-02-23 17:00:20 Well as I was saying yesterday raising the minimum age for buying weapons is all well and good but why not remove military grade weapons from the gun stores and there bullets that they fire and remove bump stocks from the stores so they can't be upgraded
6819 2018-02-23 17:00:02 Are you saying adding a bump stock illegally modified the weapon? Were there other modification he made to his firearms which made them illegal? Why do you hate bump stocks so much? Have you ever tried to shoot a gun with one? I have and I think they are stupid and ineffective.

6821 2018-02-23 16:59:40 .@FLGovScott just made a speech on what he wants 2 accomplish in legislature over next 2 weeks following the #ParklandSchoolShooting. A few: make it virtually impossible for someone w/ mental illness to buy a gun, change the age to buy a gun to 21, ban sale of bump stocks @wjxt4
6822 2018-02-23 16:59:16 Nasdaq selloff would result in a selloff of the general market and take miners down.. probably gold as well..   today you see miners up because stocks are up despite gold down some..
6823 2018-02-23 16:59:14 You don't have to give up your 2A rights, but we don't need an over-proliferation of high-capacity mags, bump-stocks, 18 year-olds buying military-style rifles, lax background checks, lax training, no mandatory trigger locks, unlicensed sales, straw purchases, etc. We can do both
6824 2018-02-23 16:58:58 I see where you're coming from, but guns aren't dangerous because of pistol grips and adjustable stocks. Unless you're banning all semi automatic rifles (which is untenable) any ban is just for show.
6825 2018-02-23 16:58:56 I feel you I'm speaking about stocks. They lost about $1.6 billion since that tweet
6826 2018-02-23 16:58:35 Absolutely, I am constantly telling my friends & family that they are definitely smart enough to pick stocks for themselves.
6827 2018-02-23 16:58:25 Universal background check
Ban assault rifles
Ban extended clips
Ban bump stocks
Federal gun pay back program.
(Fair price so we can get more guns out of cycle, only people looking to sell their guns.Then fed melts the gun down)
By law all gun buyers have to take gun safety class

6834 2018-02-23 16:57:51 Pro-tip: Don't get sucked into these bullshit 'reforms':

Banning bump stocks. The NRA/gunmakers don't really care about this

Raising the age limit to 21. The majority of these mass shootings have been at the hands of white men older than 21

Arming teachers. Stupid on its face
6835 2018-02-23 16:57:50 Trump loves good ratings. 
If Trump can do right by the American people (Public Safety) & not worry about lobbyists/NRA, it will be the greatest approvals boost he could ever imagine.
Ban weapons of war, high capacity magazines & bump stocks, implement universal background checks
6836 2018-02-23 16:57:37 That’s one thing I forgot to mention in my tweet. Using guns for hunting is fine as long as you’re not poaching. I just think that if a person can turn a gun like an AR into a deadly war weapon, then we need to take away the gun/take away bump stocks.
6837 2018-02-23 16:57:32 #ScottNRAPuppet 

Least possible action: #Pathetic! 

RT @ABC: LATEST: Florida Gov. Scott’s “major action plan” following shootings: 
- All individuals purchasing firearms 21 or older
- Violent Threat Restraining Order
- Complete ban of bump stocks
- Mandatory law enforcement
6838 2018-02-23 16:57:28 No the second amendment isn't moving forward. Gun laws have gotten stricter, bump stocks are being rejected by the NRA, and more states have gun free zones than ever before in history.
6839 2018-02-23 16:57:05 In the short run, a meaningful breakout above 3% would likely unnerve the market, however, stocks can move higher in the face of higher interest rates and the market generally doesn’t top out until earnings peak and we see a recession on the horizon.
6840 2018-02-23 16:56:55 He’s a coward. He couldn’t show up and talk to the parents and students. He should give up his support for the NRA and ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Choose life not blood money. #boycottnra
6841 2018-02-23 16:56:53 @POTUS If you are going to ban inanimate objects, you might want to think about banning forks and spoons, obesity kills more people than bump stocks.  #2nd #NRA

6843 2018-02-23 16:56:33 It’s wasn’t a serious question & he answered 2nd amendment. The tweet is out of context. I watched it & he did not mention raising the age to 21 or bump stocks...
6844 2018-02-23 16:56:31 I support you, just make sure the ban specifically states "bump fire  stocks" do not leave it open to interpretation or add other words such  as rate increasing devices. These words can be applied to any part or accessory available for a firearm and then can be included in a ban.
6845 2018-02-23 16:56:30 Stocks might slump but the prices for guns, ammo and accessories will skyrocket.  Fear buying just like after Sandy Hook.
6846 2018-02-23 16:56:23 #IAmTheNRA and I am all in on sensible gun laws.Key word being sensible. NRA has lobbied 4 laws to keep guns out of hands of those who are mentally unstable,banning bump stocks, strengthening background checks. It was law enforcement who failed these kids. Were's ur outrage 4that
6847 2018-02-23 16:55:47 Dont ban all guns. Only ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors. Mandatory background check, 2 weeks wait time, mental screening, #GunSafety training, min age of 25 for buying guns. License/regulate existing guns. Buy back AR15/AK47. #GunReformNow
6848 2018-02-23 16:55:41 Reality is, the only people refusing to come to the table & compromise is the Left. Right has offered to discuss banning accessories like bump stocks & making it illegal for anyone under 21 to buy a long rifle (includes assault weapons).  Left refuses to give on guns on campus.
6849 2018-02-23 16:55:27 My issue with that is that there are already so many of those magazines that it would be hard to get rid of them. My other problem is that it restricts the 99.9999% of legal and law abiding gun owners. But an issue that we could both get behind is banning bump stocks
6850 2018-02-23 16:55:10 There are many that say, that SPX is down when DXY is up and vice versa..  it doesn't need to be and US stocks and USD can go up in tandem as is right now...
6851 2018-02-23 16:55:10 Breaking : Le gouverneur de Floride, très pro-armes, annonce qu’il relève l’âge légal pour acheter une arme à 21 ans au lieu de 18, interdit les « bump stocks » et annonce qu’il souhaite la présence d’un officier de sécurité dans toutes les écoles de son État.
6852 2018-02-23 16:55:03 I'm going to say that people shouldn't have guns... If they have mental health problems. I believe in Gun Control, not allowing any Joe Shmoe, regardless of mental health conditions, to have a gun. I also believe in the banning of bump stocks, and certain types of assault rifles.
6853 2018-02-23 16:54:53 Florida Gov. Rick Scott  calls for raising minimum age to buy firearms from 18 to 21,  also calling for ban on “the purchase or sale of bump stocks.” The NRA has opposed changes to the age minimum.
6854 2018-02-23 16:54:51 Does Trump own gun stocks.
6855 2018-02-23 16:54:36 Hey can we make sure they know banning bump stocks isn't going to be enough now?
Good start (way too late), but nowhere near enough.

6861 2018-02-23 16:53:47 That's a very good response.  I didn't realize the Pentagon policy on the matter til your response.  I still don't think incentivizing teachers to get arms with more pay is anywhere close to the right solution.  I also think bump stocks won't make a difference.
6862 2018-02-23 16:53:36 Lol. Same shit different days. The loud little children will threaten & boycott. Then the conservatives will boycott & sales will suffer. If you invest in those companies either sale them or short them, b/c their stocks will go down. Happens every time they take Liberal position
6863 2018-02-23 16:53:26 Also, the data isn’t wrong in the meme, feel free to do the research and update. The facts are clear. Again, you don’t need a bump stock to fire a gun fast and firing fast then causes other issues. Bump stocks are a joke and you guys are wasting your time chasing that issue.
6864 2018-02-23 16:53:22 Ahh, they can’t be fixed to fire auto. Bump stocks are BS and was only used once in Vegas
6865 2018-02-23 16:53:21 .@FLGovScott--who's signed more pro-gun legislation than any other FL Gov ever—reform package of raising age 2 buy gun to 21 and banning bump stocks is good start..but this isn't just a school safety issue. It's country-wide, all ages. Need to ban AR-15 type weapons! #BoycottNRA
6866 2018-02-23 16:53:12 It's sad that @FLGovScott has announced more action in the wake of the #Parkland shooting and will probably anger the NRA then @realDonaldTrump Ban on Bump Stocks, Raise the age 21, One officer in schools per 1,000 students. but we're not done yet #NeverAgain #BoycottNRA

6878 2018-02-23 16:51:37 Because the language of laws is important so that it actually Does what is intended. If you ban modifications that make an machine gun, bump stocks are not banned
6879 2018-02-23 16:51:34 While I agree that 18 yr olds are probably too silly to own guns I think this is a mistake and unconstitutional. Also banning bump stocks is a slippery slope we probably don't want to start sliding. You'll end up down some weird rabbit hole, trust me
6880 2018-02-23 16:51:26 WATCH....do we have to?  These NRA blood suckers will float or even pass peripheral issues (18 vs 21, background checks [working good in the whitehouse], and bump stocks) and NEVER limit the NEW sales of assault weapons or regulate them in any way.
6881 2018-02-23 16:51:26 Peddling fear and terror instead of being a responsible Congressman. The terror here is from White Nationalists and heavily armed angry white men and boys - the people you are trying to cater to here. What's your position on background checks? Bump stocks? Anything that matters?

6884 2018-02-23 16:50:51 That’s what I wanna hear. Bump stocks are a great start but. Ban the weapons of war!! 
6885 2018-02-23 16:50:46 Actually, top officials at the NRA are calling for more stringent background checks that included mental health components as well as taking bump stocks of the market. National Car Rental’s decision is weak and without merit. They & other like minded org’s can expect boycotts
6886 2018-02-23 16:50:43 What about raising the age of buying rifles from 18 to 21?
What about banning bump stocks?
6887 2018-02-23 16:50:42 He didn’t say anything to oppose the NRA. NRA wants to strengthen background checks, too, just not expand them, which should happen. He didn’t bring up the age raise our bump stocks - two issues he knows the NRA opposes.
6888 2018-02-23 16:50:23 This is not just in schools! It is in any soft target areas! Stadiums- Nightclubs-Baseball fields- Movie Theaters! The large magazines and bump stocks need to be banned!
6889 2018-02-23 16:50:23 I’m not smart enough to link it, but SE Cupp posted it here in many many single page tweets. Just search for her. 

Highlights: any semi-auto with pistol grip or adjustable stock or thumb hole stock or..... Olympic target rifles have thumbhole stocks. Are they really a threat?
6890 2018-02-23 16:49:59 You have just explained that if we don't agree with your terms we are wrong.

We agree on back ground checks

We agree on the mentally ill.

Hell we have even evolved on bump stocks.

What position have you changed?

But UK and Australian type gun controls are a non starter.
6891 2018-02-23 16:49:58 -He wants to get rid of bump stocks. 
-He wants to raise the legal age to purchase a gun to 21. 
-He wants to armed security inside the schools. 
(CNN won't mention any of this)
6892 2018-02-23 16:49:35 the gun manufacturers won't feel it until their stocks start to sink. #BoycottNRA not remotely enough. Divest. Does @TIAA CREF invest in index funds that invest in gun makers?

6894 2018-02-23 16:49:29 Again - I didn't say they were 'assault rifles'  -   that's different.  They are 'assault weapons' because they are semi-automatic.  The Vegas shooter fired more than 1100 rounds using bump stocks with his.  They can still kill humans extremely quickly and are uniquely deadly
6895 2018-02-23 16:49:29 Mysz , big vol.break 2.2 will go to 2.25-2.3-2.5$...it can be ...big vol.big stocks in buy
6896 2018-02-23 16:49:10 But semi-automatics and bump stocks, and like weapons have to go.
6897 2018-02-23 16:48:47 I thought h also said make bump stocks illegal to purchase !.??
6898 2018-02-23 16:48:29 Hahaha the only crook who's under investigation is Trump**** not a legitimate pres. #BanAssaultWeapons when bullets hit any organ in ur body it explodes & you're dead.. have all the normal rifles - no bump stocks no one's going to take away your 2nd amend. Buy rifles & handguns.
6899 2018-02-23 16:48:25 Honest question. How is banning bump stocks, doing background checks on ALL firearms purchases, requiring training & license, enforcing storage laws & cutting down high capacity mags *punishing* gun owners?

6904 2018-02-23 16:47:50 I wasn't aware there were harsh restrictions on owning semi-auto riffles. I wasn't aware there was a van on large magazines or bump stocks. Also, the CDC needs to be able to study gun violence. It is kind of their job. So no, what we want does not exist.
6905 2018-02-23 16:47:32 You won't have to outlaw bump stocks if you just rename them "homosexual stocks".
6906 2018-02-23 16:47:32 The title says, „CryptoAssets“, not stocks.
6907 2018-02-23 16:47:20 Just called Kansas rep Yoder & Sens Roberts & Moran: since Roberts is considering raising to 21 the age to purchase AR 15, maybe this is not ENTIRELY a liberal left wing nutcase of an idea. Encouraged all 3 to consider b/stocks & b/ground checks. CALL!
6908 2018-02-23 16:47:20 Bump stocks, YES. they are simply a way to circumvent the law on automatic weapons
6909 2018-02-23 16:47:19 Larry’s blatant bias/ignorance are why we struggle to find solutions. More regulation is needed. Stronger background checks and banning bump stocks for example. Better security is needed in schools. Armed security like at airports and sports events. Politics block compromise.
6910 2018-02-23 16:47:09 I don't want to close it just yet. Don't you think money will go from stocks to the bond market?
6911 2018-02-23 16:47:03 Is this Democrap's new target for voters? (Protecting criminals?) Is their anything level they won't sink to inorder to secure votes?That is a real Question?please us another car renter! I think Soros owns this company stocks?
6912 2018-02-23 16:46:54 A good way to put pressure on gun companies is to have people pull their money out of stocks. Many 401k plans have gun company stocks in them and people don't even know.
6913 2018-02-23 16:46:43 No one gives a crap about bumpfire stocks they are stupid to any real gun enthusiasts but where does it stop lots of things could potentially increase the rate of fire
6914 2018-02-23 16:46:40 Not a problem. Ban bump stocks. I also think the age should be 21.
6915 2018-02-23 16:46:35 Yeah right now the terms of the debate are being set entirely by the NRA. We're literally arguing over bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
6916 2018-02-23 16:46:33 @SullyCNBC Gun/Ammo manufacturers' stocks not soaring on sales as they have in the past because no investor or gun buyer believes this administration and legislature will impose gun control of any serious sort.
6917 2018-02-23 16:46:09 Same. I’ve seen people buy out entire stocks. It’s ducking ridiculous
6918 2018-02-23 16:45:56 Förlåt en okunnig... Men vad är bump stocks?
6919 2018-02-23 16:45:47 ...@realDonaldTrump you will PUSH for comprehensive background checks with emphasis on mental health would be a step in the right direction.  NO ONE should be able to buy or cell BUMP STOCKS.  So it is time to quit "hoping" and to do something positive.  The ...
6920 2018-02-23 16:45:47 This meme, besides being 6 years old, is total BS and doesn’t compare apples to apples. Handguns and the other rifles do not use high capacity magazines and are not modified with bump stocks to allow them to shoot like automatic weapons. Find all the stupid memes you want.
6921 2018-02-23 16:45:35 Are you questioning my ethics on other stocks? Or are you cracking a joke, which is cool. Let me know.
6922 2018-02-23 16:45:20 If one Invest in just this stocks ...! this screener is superb ! Oh! @krishnakhanna this is a blessing for all ur followers !
6923 2018-02-23 16:45:19 @FLGovScott WE DO SUPPORT THE 2ND AMENDMENT! WE DO WANT ASSAULT WEAPONS & Bump Stocks BANNED! They are Military weapons & belong THERE ONLY! For 8 yrs U have supported the NRA with an A+ rating! Now U suddenly have a plan? U should have done this 8 yrs ago! PHONY! #NEVERAGAIN
6924 2018-02-23 16:44:55 Had to sit out of these 2 because I would've gotten in too late : ( Though I may take a position if it gets moving again.
6925 2018-02-23 16:44:30 And it's not common sense. You calling it makes anyone opposed automatically not have common sense. You may feel they are good ideas/laws.. but many do not. Bump stocks fine. Wtf does magazine limits do? It takes 1 second to change mags.
6926 2018-02-23 16:44:23 @SullyCNBC gun stocks up under obama due to fear of regs. Guns down now due to divestiture by funds and by public pullback. Money talks,
6927 2018-02-23 16:44:08 How can one tweet knock a billion off the value of a company’s stocks? When did we give the Kardashians/Jenners such power? Are they the alternative to the Machines taking over?
6928 2018-02-23 16:43:46 The greatest sniper, Chris Kyle, was killed by a crazy guy with a gun.  Arming teachers is dangerous to the teachers and the students.  Assault weapons, large magazines and bump stocks need to be banned NOW.
6929 2018-02-23 16:43:01 Handing firemarms to teachers and expecting them to put down rabid gunmen is something a third world country would do. The de-evolution of our society should alarm "Constitutionalists" more than a ban on bump-stocks and high-capacity magazines.
6930 2018-02-23 16:42:46 Really little interest at present in FX. US stocks drifting off in a quiet session
6931 2018-02-23 16:42:42 Really little interest at present in FX. US stocks drifting off in a quiet session
6932 2018-02-23 16:42:32 US stocks off the highs and FX markets very quiet. No bounce though in EUR crosses
6933 2018-02-23 16:42:19 US stocks off the highs and FX markets very quiet. No bounce though in EUR crosses
6934 2018-02-23 16:42:08 #NRA #Florida  Giving the external pressure being put on Governor Scott in a pretty evenly split state like Florida.I think we should be thankful he only added bump-stocks,and raised the age limit.Bump-stocks where gone anyway.Everything else was Good.He had to do something....
6935 2018-02-23 16:41:38 This Plan Is #WeakNotMajor at all.
- All individuals purchasing firearms 21 or older
- Violent Threat Restraining Order
- Complete ban of bump stocks
- Mandatory law enforcement officer in every public school
You forgot to add: Approved by NRA
#BanAssaultWeapons #DoNothingScott
6936 2018-02-23 16:41:34 Just heard gun stocks are going down and I can’t stop dancing
6937 2018-02-23 16:41:22 Botom line: People have easy access to guns, especially ones that can do a lot of damage, like AR-15 rifles and bump stocks. And there is too much anger, hatred and resentment in America that is encouraged by the NRA, FOX news, and conservative radio.
6938 2018-02-23 16:41:11 Agreed. Banning bump stocks will start a slippery slope of regulation.
6939 2018-02-23 16:40:49 What about with legally purchased bump stocks??
6940 2018-02-23 16:40:15 What don't you understand about the NRA are not liking that you want to raise the age to 21, not liking you wanting to stop selling bump stocks, what do you not understand. There was a guard at school that only stood outside and watched for 4 minutes instead of facing gunman. BAD
6941 2018-02-23 16:40:08 Florida Gov. Scott’s announcements: 
- All individuals purchasing firearms 21 or older
- Violent Threat Restraining Order
- Complete ban of bump stocks
- Mandatory law enforcement officer in every public school
6942 2018-02-23 16:39:51 The proposal coming out of Florida to prevent mass shootings makes it sound like the state is at war. Armed officers at all schools. Locked doors, surveillance. Active shooter drills every month. Ban bump stocks, large magazines. Raise age of gun sales to 21.
6943 2018-02-23 16:39:51 Not going to let YOU choose my weapon of self defense. My body, my choice. That's a slippery slope we aren't taking.  You get bump stocks. That's it.
6944 2018-02-23 16:39:45 @FLGovScott raises gun purchase age to 21, bans bump-stocks, bans people with mental health issues from purchasing gun, more to come. It's a start.  #NeverAgain #GunControl
6945 2018-02-23 16:39:14 Then you will IMMEDIATELY sign an executive order outlawing all semi-automatics (including AR-15s), automatics, bump stocks, remove ALL loopholes to background checks incl private sales, etc.  Otherwise, you're lying outright, and using innocent blood to pay for it.
6946 2018-02-23 16:38:52 Allowing them to be murdered? So was Obama responsible for all the mass shootings on his watch? He did zip, zero, nada to help on gun violence in 8 years. Trump just basically banned bump stocks. Obama didn’t even do that small step
6947 2018-02-23 16:38:45 Y'all know me as an avid pro-gun guy. But Ban bump-stocks? Idc ive never used one or feel the need to have one. Increase level of background checks? Sure I've never done anything wrong. Raise the age requirement?  Not as big a fan but alright i guess. Even a week long wait- ok.
6948 2018-02-23 16:38:12 Except that the Florida shooter had nothing to do with bump stocks.
6949 2018-02-23 16:38:12 schools are severely underfunded, this is well known.  But i think moving age to 21yrs old for assault riffles, more thorough background checks, and banning bump stocks is something we can agree on.  NRA just wants to sell more guns.  They are not part of any solution
6950 2018-02-23 16:38:10 Sorry to post so much, but this is an important topic.  More regulations are needed. Stronger background checks and banning bump stocks for example. Better security is needed in schools, armed security like at airports and sports events. This can’t be that difficult to agree on.
6951 2018-02-23 16:38:06 Forget about that why exchange still did not put Gitanjali jems stocks under GSM category if not suspended till now whom instructions they are awaiting for
6952 2018-02-23 16:38:01 Sure... in my main trading account I usually am actively day trading stocks that I am bullish on rather then letting the play work for itself. So with this account I'll scale into stocks im most bullish on and will trust my read and play for the big pay day.
6953 2018-02-23 16:38:00 @realDonaldTrump Please  oppose expansion of fed background checks & oppose the ban on bump stocks, for they are currently loaded with additional boilerplate.  Please do not disparage/judge the benefit of Active Shooter training until you/member of your staff has attended one.
6954 2018-02-23 16:38:00 Gov. Scott not proposing banning assault rifles like the AR-15 but is calling for the banning of bump stocks.
6955 2018-02-23 16:36:57 Gov Scott doesn't agree with arming teachers, wants to mandate law enforcement at schools, to limit firearms purchases to 21 and older, to ban bump stocks and to keep guns from those with violent restraining orders
6956 2018-02-23 16:36:55 why did he pass bumps stocks?
6957 2018-02-23 16:36:55 FL Gov. Rick Scott laying out action plan: We will completely ban the purchase or sale of bump stocks.
6958 2018-02-23 16:36:47 @MSNBC The unemployment numbers are made up!!!  A tremendous number of people have been shut out of the job market.  The stock market number is an artificial number based on 30 stocks, get real everybody.  The rise in gasoline has already wiped out tax break for liddle folks.
6959 2018-02-23 16:36:46 NOW: Gov. Scott announces major changes to gun laws and school safety including the ban of bump stocks, raising the age to purchase guns to 21, and placing one officer per 1,000 students in every public school @Telemundo51 @nbc6 @FLGovScott
6960 2018-02-23 16:36:43 We don't think much of bump stocks, but, when was one ever used in mass murder? We are investigating Vegas, and DO KNOW that Paddock's room (with bump stocks) was TOTALLY STAGED..Killiary's 'If bump stocks were used,  it would have been worse': JUST RIDICULOUS! Ulterior Motives.
6961 2018-02-23 16:36:42 Yes! At least to add overseas stocks b/c 1) diversification, 2) higher expected returns. But Buffett would obviously hang on to S&P 500, whereas Harvard alums seem like classic return chasers. That doesn't end well.
6962 2018-02-23 16:36:27 We want assault rifles and bump stocks banned you jerk
6963 2018-02-23 16:36:01 "Don't be high when you're buying and selling stocks." - Charles Schultze

6966 2018-02-23 16:35:45 Mkt just scared to go lower or higher from here. Plain & Simple. But risk is still to the UPside. Most stocks just trading chips right now. And then there's $TSLA.

6969 2018-02-23 16:35:08 Why don't you provide more stocks then,  
6970 2018-02-23 16:35:08 Actually still looking for copper stocks to pullback to 200 DMA. Time will tell.

6972 2018-02-23 16:35:03 Fl Gov. Scott announced gun action plan, raising age to purchase any gun to 21, implement gun violence restraining orders, makes bump stocks illegal, increasing mental health case workers statewide, and in schools. +more. #gunsense
6973 2018-02-23 16:35:02 So 18 year old kids who network themselves during their college days to have better deals when they hit the open job market (the nba) are considered cheaters, but members of congress are exempt from the Insider Trading Laws that allow their stocks to perform 12.3% better. #NCAA

6976 2018-02-23 16:34:56 @jimcramer is there a sweet spot for how many individual stocks someone should own? Is it possible to be too diversified?
6977 2018-02-23 16:34:46 I can even say we can ban bump stocks. All these things are common sense items that are not being followed/ implemented that can seriously deter mass shootings wihout taking our constitutional rights away.
6978 2018-02-23 16:34:22 @Harvard endowment. Do you own gun maker stocks or an index fund that does? Come on campus activists, hit the bricks. Does your university invest your tuition money in gun stocks?
6979 2018-02-23 16:34:15 Excepting the @M_Star_Online of course. Now that’s a tabloid that should be more readily available.  I have to order mine. No one round here stocks it.
6980 2018-02-23 16:34:09 All these dirty politicians (especially Trump) think they are fooling us and these kids by saying they’re going to raise the age limit from 18 to 21 and pass law on on bump stocks?!?! First of all, bump stocks should’ve been banned after the Vegas shooting!!!
6981 2018-02-23 16:33:48 I’m tryna make 2k lose 1.3 billion in stocks lol
6982 2018-02-23 16:33:42 It is well settled that natural rights do not govern this republic & no where does the constitution indicate or has the SCOTUS held the right to bear arms includes semi-automatics, automatics, bump-stocks, high velocity ammunition or large magazines, grenades, RPG's. 50 cals  etc
6983 2018-02-23 16:33:41 CJ Roberts sold his @Microsoft shares in Jan. 2016 so he could vote for cert. in MSFT v. Baker. (He will also sit in next week's MSFT v. US). Yet he, Breyer & Alito still own 50 individual stocks; that led to 47 cert.-stage recusals last year. They should divest already!
6984 2018-02-23 16:33:14 MBS start higher this morning, up 19bps; 10yr Treasury has pulled back below floor of support (formerly the tough ceiling of resistance), now about 2.87%.  Stocks are all up, with the DOW up over 150.
6985 2018-02-23 16:33:02 You've done enough damage,with your stocks 
6986 2018-02-23 16:33:02 This is literally what they are working on right now? Background checks, banning of bump stocks, raise age to buy, etc. And they are asking for an open discussion about what else to do. What more do you want?????
6987 2018-02-23 16:33:01 I have to ask why are you trying to ban bump stocks and let you know if you ban a bump stocks that people can just loop a leather belt to make a homemade bump stock. Also i speak this generation and the whole school shooter thing is a meme used to pick on people.
6988 2018-02-23 16:32:33 @RWDSU @UFCW @AFLCIO @MassAGO @SEIU Boycott, Divest and Sanctions against Gun manufacturers... get them where it hurts the most... their wallets. demand that your pension funds sell their stocks today...
6989 2018-02-23 16:32:20 Stocks and bonds moving in the same direction quite a bit these days. How/when will they divert?
6990 2018-02-23 16:32:15 I knew someone would correct me, thank you. I stand by my opinion re: high capacity magazines. Combined with still legal bump stocks...
Anyway I don’t claim to have a solution. I live rurally and have a gun. I have no problem with more stringent ownership requirements...
6991 2018-02-23 16:32:11 So many of these stocks that people talk about on twitter are all NRs... All bark, no bite... I guess its cool if you are looking to flip a few pennies, If you are investing long term, too many fluffy NRs is a red flag.
6992 2018-02-23 16:31:47 In The Market: Why is the #sp500 doing as well as #nasdaq today? #tech #stocks have a lot to do w/ it. On pctg basis, $HPE $HPQ $MU $WDC $INTC up 2.5%+. And #utilities get relief from drop in US Treasury 10-year yield, now 2.88%. See $EIX and $ES #investing @IBDinvestors
6993 2018-02-23 16:31:39 OK, so you are pro bump stocks and against the 21 y o age limit, and as these things are discussed on CNN you can't watch it? I am just curious!
6994 2018-02-23 16:31:30 No one is against that though. The original tweet said stocks plummeted because of Kylie’s tweet, which it did. You’re the one that’s saying otherwise
6995 2018-02-23 16:31:30 Your Boyner is a butterfly likely his goods at his stores what are mostly left overs in the stocks of the brands including foreign brands.

Next time do not try to hack my mobile. We know much more about butterflies rather than you do.
6996 2018-02-23 16:31:21 I know stocks arent live im messaging people before hand sorry if i dont get round to you
6997 2018-02-23 16:31:19 Do you think the Feds are buying stocks directly?
6998 2018-02-23 16:31:12 @FLGovScott, why Ban the sale of bump stocks, when you’re NOT banning the sale of automatic weapons?? This makes NO SENSE.  The rest of your plan is good. Please, please forget the NRA and do what MAKES SENSE. You KNOW what’s right. #JustDoIt
6999 2018-02-23 16:31:00 By act, he means he will throw us a bone by getting rid of bump stocks, gee whiz
7000 2018-02-23 16:30:57 Do you guys remember when white people were calling @theMagunga racist because he stocks books primarily from African writers in his online book store? 

Enyewe tumeona vitu twitter
7001 2018-02-23 16:30:42 Spreading all this crap at a time when Kimberberly-Clark job cuts may affect toilet paper stocks is poor timing.
7002 2018-02-23 16:30:21 The #NRA has joined @realDonaldTrump in attacking our #press calling them #FakeNews and accusing us #Democrats of being illogical.

We just want sensible legislation:
- no more bump stocks
- no silencers
- you can't buy an assault rifle until you're 21, same age as alcohol
7003 2018-02-23 16:29:51 Florida Gov. Scott’s announcements:

- Complete ban of bump stocks
- Mandatory law enforcement officer in every public school
7004 2018-02-23 16:29:51 So Kylie Jenner says snapchat is out and their stocks dropped. Do you still use it? @BrittaniPulseFM
7005 2018-02-23 16:29:30 Karin love your take on stocks etc and I’d be happy to stop if you agree to stop talking about R50Billion tax collecting shortfall confusing it with the R200Billion budget deficit and call the elephant  in the room as it is.
7006 2018-02-23 16:29:28 I’ve no problem with people having guns as long as it’s regulated like we do other things like cars. Training and licensure, banning ar15 and bump fire stocks, and providing mental health services for people who need it. We need comprehensive health care to address this.
7007 2018-02-23 16:29:28 (2/23/2018) Top 10 Trending Stocks:

Perform ATWWI "DRILL DOWN" for monetization candidates.
7008 2018-02-23 16:29:16 This way madness lies.  The answer is fewer guns, no semis or bump stocks, good universal health care, living wages, and a reality check about how the US is becoming a war zone. It's been that way for PoC forever, and we should have reigned in the gun market before this.  Enough.
7009 2018-02-23 16:28:40 Again, there is no denying questions need to be asked, and changes can be made. We are all evolving, the bill of rights is evolving. Where does it end though Pual? Today it is ar-15’s, tomorrow it is bump stocks. Next week it is ammunition, calibers, etc etc..
7010 2018-02-23 16:28:32 Kylie Jenner tweeted “so does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me” which made Snapchat stocks sink 7.2 percent, wiping out $1.3 billion of its market value  it’s crazy that one person and one tweet could have that much power. But same.
7011 2018-02-23 16:28:30 I wonder if the left will financially back this company when stocks drop and sales dwindle.
7012 2018-02-23 16:28:25 Please reconsider Mr. President. Making private sales illegal will do nothing to reduce violent crime. If it did, it would have stopped the San Bernardino massacre. Banning bump stocks is pointless for the same reason.
7013 2018-02-23 16:28:16 One of the problems with trying to position your politics in the center of issues is that the right will always bury you in debates about bullshit details. Will closing the gun show loophole stop secondary sales? Will banning bump stocks just encourage similar devices?

7015 2018-02-23 16:28:12 Stocks are over valued with a 70 % chance of a major recession before 2020. If we are not the worlds police wht are we adding 100's of billions to the military budget? Trump hasn't worked an honest day in his life. He sells his name to put on buildings and sleeps with porn stars.
7016 2018-02-23 16:28:09 So is my store getting them next week? Or next month? I called today to ask again now they're telling me that that item doesn't ship until March. Yet I was told before that my store stocks the item. And they where just out at the time. I really want this item and need help.
7017 2018-02-23 16:28:00 Never seen Dem donate. You really think small stuff compares to the $400,000 salary? Think he will put a plan in place to have Mexico pay but that isn’t as easy as it sounds! Congress all agreed on bump stocks yet couldn’t pass a bill for it! Wall will be hard enough w/o payment!
7018 2018-02-23 16:28:00 You are exactly right.  The sound of reason, instead of arming teachers and " hardening" our schools. Ban assault rifles for civilians and bump stocks and better background checks.
7019 2018-02-23 16:28:00 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
7020 2018-02-23 16:27:56 Why would trump advocate for #GunControl #GunReform via raising minimum age to purchase and banning bump stocks then say at #cpac2018 "they" wanna take your 2nd amendment away you gotta fight at the poles this year 
7021 2018-02-23 16:27:51 Fact: U.S. Investors hold 2.3 trillion in unrealized capital gains, in stocks and mutual funds.
7022 2018-02-23 16:27:38 The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre admitted the NRA wrote the foundation bill of the NICS System during C-PAC yesterday and boasted about it. They also supported the 1990 Gun Free Zone Act & ban bump stocks. How do you say you’re protecting the 2nd Amendment?  Yes, they have been wrong.

7026 2018-02-23 16:27:00 The nra has actually said ban bump stocks, we already have background checks and gun owners support that. If anyone had any responsibility why are people not outraged at the sheriff who clearly didn’t do his job.

7028 2018-02-23 16:26:42 I actually think the opposite: a strong economy keeps investors in traditional assets like stocks, while a weak economy pushes investors towards hedges, like gold and crypto. Just my 2 cents.

7079 2018-02-23 16:20:07 Really? The NRA is against bump stocks. They support responsible gun ownership and background checks. They and their members understand and respect guns and the importance of proper care and usage. And they support legislation that makes sense.

7091 2018-02-23 16:18:38 It was also great to see him hide behind the president about bump stocks when he has to know that the ATF has already stated there is nothing they can do about bump stocks without a new law being passed. He also knows Congress won’t act.
7092 2018-02-23 16:18:37 There are reasonable solutions to gun violence that do not involve taking away law abiding gun owners rights. 

These include universal background checks, bans on bump stocks, safe storage requirements, and an assault weapons ban.

7095 2018-02-23 16:18:13 Seeing how automatic firearms are already illegal, it would make sense to also ban bump stocks. Semi + Bump Stock == Automatic. The Parkland and Orlando mass shooters relied on them. Bump stocks are significant, not negligible IMO.

7099 2018-02-23 16:18:01 So basically bump stocks will still be available at pawn shops & black market dealers. Wouldn't it be better to monitor who's purchasing and follow up with those people? Pushing them underground eliminates tracking.

7109 2018-02-23 16:15:16 @realDonaldTrump is asking for a ban on bump stocks, the age to purchase long guns to be raised, enhanced background checks and the option to arm willing teachers. It's not everything some are demanding, but I think these are solid goals that Congress can act on.

7112 2018-02-23 16:14:54 It means banning bump stocks and other devices that can mimic full auto mode and serve no purpose other than to expedite mass murder.
7113 2018-02-23 16:14:49 No, I did not hear that on any news network. I don’t subscribe to cable news. Because it’s partisan  malarkey. And as far as bump stocks ago, the NRA walked back its advocacy and is yet to comment on the new legislation
7114 2018-02-23 16:14:22 Ban bump stocks, beef up background checks, raise age limit for certain gun types. Train school volunteers in gun safety and use. Harden school access points, Mental health training for parents, students, teachers to spot signs of trouble before they blow. Holistic approach.
7115 2018-02-23 16:14:04 There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
7116 2018-02-23 16:14:03 This seems like part of the strategy on the pro-gun side.  Limit the debate to just the specifics of the most recent tragedy.  

Sandy Hook: Mental health
Orlando/San Bernardino: Terrorism
Vegas: Bump stocks
Parkland: "School security"

Never guns, though.
7117 2018-02-23 16:13:47 I'm not against gun ownership, I'm against war weapons getting into the hands of crazies. 

The problem& solution is multifaceted. 

Asking for AR-15 to be illegal is not unreasonable. Bump stocks, high capacity magazines, etc.

Mental Health, school resources, background checks.

7122 2018-02-23 16:12:59 I understand push for mental health back ground checks. But dont understand the 21 age change or the bump stock.

7123 2018-02-23 16:12:56 Dude are sick or something, just the big coorporate tax breaks alone are going to swell the deficit big time by over a trillion, left for us to continue to pick up the tab. Stocks are all ready shaky and big companies are layimg off people even with the tax break.
7124 2018-02-23 16:12:42 Yeah, just like the armed deputy did in Florida.  Let's move instead with a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks and close point-of-purchase loopholes.
7125 2018-02-23 16:12:40 It's the old "accuse your enemies of what you're guilty of yourself" ploy. Nobody loves school shootings more than the @NRA. Gun sales go up. The stocks of gun companies go up. And they get to preach their "We need more guns" rhetoric.

7135 2018-02-23 16:10:23 This is terrific. People also need to put pressure on investment managers who are including these stocks in pension and 401K portfolios. Also, putting pressure on company board members, calling their investor relations depts, and flooding their customer service lines are key.
7136 2018-02-23 16:09:59 Does Wayne Lapierre really believe that banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase an AR from 18 to 21 is the opposition's plan to eliminate the 2nd amendment?

7138 2018-02-23 16:09:40 It would be a good idea right now get rid of bump stocks. Trump says he'll review it do you believe it I don't. He lied about everything Joe
7139 2018-02-23 16:09:39 I was referring to bump stocks making semis into machine guys, since the discussion was about CNN and this is one of the gun control issues people are talking about there. The 18->21 age limit is another. What other measures are you opposing?

7144 2018-02-23 16:08:59 So if POTUS acts on gun control, the dems lose one more talking point!!!! Remember - Obummer/Holder allowed all those weapons back onto the streets in Fast and Furious!! Bump stocks allowed under Obummer!! Only DJT has the guts to make change!!!!

7151 2018-02-23 16:07:17 This i can agree on.  Not sure how you report / track mental health issues. Need some new laws written for that.  Hippa stuff.  Bump stocks are stupid.  I'm on fence about the age thing.  Keep in mind I was hunting when I was 15 years old, but I was not buying / owning rifles.
7152 2018-02-23 16:07:14 Where does it not say to have bump stocks that shouldn’t matter it’s not against the law.
Do to much more against guns to stop guns you will start a war has it ever dawned on you how about making schools safer.
Lot of things can be made into deadly weapons don’t have to be guns.

7157 2018-02-23 16:06:35 Why do you need bump stocks and 30 round mags? Low accuracy/high capacity is good for shooting into crowds and not much else.
7158 2018-02-23 16:06:32 They tried to ban AKs at some point because of gang violence. So they made "sport" AKs with thumbhole stocks and different accessories.
7159 2018-02-23 16:06:23 @realDonaldTrump What about bump stocks,Mr. President?
7160 2018-02-23 16:06:22 Are you aware of no-take zones and MPAs? Yes there is more protection required, but management strategies such as these, alongside aquaculture and strict quotas ensure fish stocks come from sustainable resources. Arguably, climate change is a larger threat
7161 2018-02-23 16:06:07 @Avis @Hertz stocks on the rise. 
7162 2018-02-23 16:06:05 Besides that, most people who don’t know anything about guns believe an AR-15 is a fully automatic weapon. A legal AR-15 is not. Bump stocks are a poor man’s modification to keep the gun “legal”. A much simpler mod can turn the AR-15 into full auto but that is illegal.
7163 2018-02-23 16:05:54 But that was the point. Ms 2nd amendment up there claimed bump stocks are her right. So based on that, I'd assume she means law. Tilly followed suit w that logic to prove her point. Keep up Brad.

7170 2018-02-23 16:03:53 We’re holding the @NRA accountable because they are not offering solutions that support deterrent ex: ban bumper stocks, ban assault rifles for non-military personnel and raise the purchase age to 21.

7223 2018-02-23 15:51:54 I have gun owners in my family & they are totally against the sale of semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks to the public because there is NO REASON any civilian needs to own those things!  They are for mass murder and nothing else!!!!
7224 2018-02-23 15:51:45 Ummm Stormy, try again. The bill banning bump stocks has already passed the House. No one objected. Seriously, u gotta start using ur brain. Blindly following CNN is getting u nowhere.
7225 2018-02-23 15:51:42 You know that's BS. Dem's and other's are calling for a ban on Assault Weapons, bump stocks, magazine's that hold ungodly rounds of ammo. We are NOT calling for a ban on all guns, and we do not want 2A to be repealed! For God's sake, many of us are gun owners!!
7226 2018-02-23 15:51:27 Ban: assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines.
If someone says anything stupid like arm teachers say BAN ASSAULT RIFLES BUMP STOCKS HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES!
Ignore their stupid derail tactic and talk down to them like they deserve.
7227 2018-02-23 15:51:24 Or have high capacity magazines and bump stocks to go with them.
7228 2018-02-23 15:50:38 I think #BackgroundChecks  need to be done, even at #gun shows. All sales (including private) should have bill of sale with s/n. No one under 21 able to purchase gun. Ban bump-stocks and +10 magazines. Assault weapons restricted. No armour piercing or tracer ammo. 
#gunsense
7229 2018-02-23 15:50:24 I appreciate the steps you are trying to take by expanding background checks and banning bump stocks. Arming teachers is a bad idea because the prevalence of guns in our society is core to why we have so much gun violence.
7230 2018-02-23 15:50:21 Including protecting schools better. When you are alerted to a threat you need to do all that’s possible to find this person and stop them. Things like banning  bump stocks and background checks I’m for.
7231 2018-02-23 15:50:14 We also need to boycott pension funds that are holding these stocks and put pressure on 401K managers as well. Pressure on the boards of these companies and phone calls to their investor relations people wouldn't hurt either (speaking as a former Wall Street analyst)
7232 2018-02-23 15:49:47 It is the TRUTH. Stop hiding behind LIES. If you are in favor of letting civilians easily purchase semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks then you are an accessory to murder every single time they use them to murder people!!! STOP LYING!!

7253 2018-02-23 15:46:23 Great question! We need to figure that out and see who purchases gun manufacturering stocks.
7254 2018-02-23 15:46:01 Again you are such a soy boy's you have no idea just how fast a magazine can be replaced in a semi automatic handgun. Or how many rounds can be shot in just a few minutes.
I will agree bump stocks should be banned. Just like assault weapons were.
7255 2018-02-23 15:45:49 Strict background checks, bans on certain types of guns, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, higher age restrictions, PTP laws, prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from purchasing guns, contribution limits for organizations like the NRA who seek to buy influence
7256 2018-02-23 15:45:46 sir is this the  lowest fno rollover taken place? last month long  upmkt this month down low rollover that means no longs carried forward ? means sellinto come up side till 10555-635 jst to make RSI  up to 50-55-60 nifty n stocks. pls reply
7257 2018-02-23 15:45:35 Sure, we can get as pedantic as you want. At some point it's all silly. Point is global RP is much less biased than US stocks/bonds.
7258 2018-02-23 15:45:19 Fuck the @NRA. Shooting are literal gold to them with stocks and sales rising after each.

7262 2018-02-23 15:45:07 NRA member & mother OF a teacher:  Ban semi automatics, automatics, and bump stocks for civilians. Stop selling ammunition for certain weapons. Encourage states (like GA:)) and each county school system to allow qualified  teachers the right to carry a gun in school.

7265 2018-02-23 15:44:26 Jake Clark, student at Ohio State, thinks an AR15 can be altered to be an automatic weapon. Absolutely cannot be done. (Not talking about bump stocks.)

7269 2018-02-23 15:43:26 @BrandonVanZee  Brandon, do prices of Dividend Aristocrat stocks tend to hold up well in an environment of rising interest rates?
7270 2018-02-23 15:43:24 Stocks higher again. No reason not to be higher. You can get 2.9% on a ten year. Or practically the same yield on many great companies that are growing earnings. Bond yields are no match for stocks with tax reform
7271 2018-02-23 15:43:09 Small correction -Mother of All Time Bubbles (Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate and public Trust) upon us
7272 2018-02-23 15:43:01 Good Quality stocks are never cheap. Which is why even if a 5-10% correction is a good entry point. Look at IndusInd or HDFC Bank etc..they hardly corrected 5-10% from the peak.
7273 2018-02-23 15:42:54 I wonder how their stocks will do when gun owners boycott them?
7274 2018-02-23 15:42:46 Don't invest in gun stocks, don't back the NRA......

7276 2018-02-23 15:42:34 It cracks me up, the president has come out and said he wants to ban bump stocks and work on better background checks. Yet those for more gun laws still aren’t happy. 
7277 2018-02-23 15:42:21 Well mass migration has been caused in part by our actions in the middle east. The fishing policy has helped stocks rebuild and we are responsible in part for some of the downsides. None of these points solely down to EU. Brexit #isitworthit Thanks for replying 
7278 2018-02-23 15:41:58 I’m all for guns, I own many including an AR, and I’m all for common sense solutions including getting rid of bump stocks etc, but arming teachers isn’t the answer lol
7279 2018-02-23 15:41:58 didnt know Weiner, Franken, Conyers, Bill Clinton, Bobby Scott, Reuben Kihuen were Republican. most mass shootings under Obama than any pres, he approved bump stocks & encouraged illegals to vote...so whats your message again?
7280 2018-02-23 15:41:51 Now you want to make freaking jokes about your bald spot at CPAC you’re a joke talking about your tax cut Democrats don’t understand what tax reform means. Your tax cuts have only heard the middle class pharmaceutical companies pocket their money and buy back their stocks.
7281 2018-02-23 15:41:31 Snapchat lost 1.8 billion dollars in stocks after Kylie Jenner tweeted she doesn’t use it anymore.
7282 2018-02-23 15:41:28 HBRM? OCSY longs team.
7283 2018-02-23 15:41:25 He also has proposed banning bump stocks and large magazines. For the moment, he appears to be willing to put his relationship with the NRA at stake for the good of the country. So I'm going to call that a small victory.
7284 2018-02-23 15:41:19 #45 touting stocks up 37% which is money in the Plutocrats bank. Has your income grown 37% has it grown even 7%? #Midterms2018 #Vote #MA3
7285 2018-02-23 15:40:55 I'd do that. The Suns are going to keep feeding him minutes the opportunity will be there. Fairly confident the stocks will be very nice long-term. FG has been at 43% the last two months on increased volume, so some good signs there.
7286 2018-02-23 15:40:46 No. I’m for what Trump is proposing. No automatic weapons, no bump stocks, raise the age for assault rifles to 21 unless you’re in, or have served in the military, universal background checks, and mandatory universial gun safety classes for some kind of FOID card.
7287 2018-02-23 15:40:42 Ding Ding Ding! It's why gun manufacture's stocks go up every time as if on cue whenever we have a mass shooting, or we have a Black man in the White House!
7288 2018-02-23 15:40:39 So no fund rebalancing into stocks next weeks?
7289 2018-02-23 15:40:32 Trump says he's glad stocks "did a little bit of a correction" as gains since he entered office were becoming a bit embarrassing
7290 2018-02-23 15:40:32 Ban magazines over 7 rounds, ban semiautomatic rifles, 100% background checks, ban bump stocks, ban belt fed weapons. @realDonaldTrump @NRA @CNN @VanJones68 @andersoncooper @AMarch4OurLives #GunReformNow
7291 2018-02-23 15:40:24 didnt know Weiner, Franken, Conyers, Bill Clinton, Bobby Scott, Reuben Kihuen were Republican. most mass shootings under Obama than any pres, he approved bump stocks & encouraged illegals to vote...so whats your message again?
7292 2018-02-23 15:40:12 I mean I don't have one and probably never will.  I still don't think we should give another thing to people who will not be satisfied no matter what we give up. They will see that banning bump stocks didn't stop the next shooting so then it will be "who needs 30 rd magazines?"
7293 2018-02-23 15:39:37 Sell gun stocks.
Divest from gun makers.
Demand that gun companies be removed from ETFs and trading indexes.
Shame everyone who works for the NRA.
Shame everyone who receives funds from the NRA.

We can do this. #GunViolence #GunControl
7294 2018-02-23 15:39:13 Here is compromise: increase age on semi-auto rifles to 21 (in line w/ handguns) and implement reciprocity on CCW permits. Specialized program to train vets, ex LEOs to serve similar to air marshals. Allow limited number of teachers who possess CCW to carry. No more bump stocks

No one needs automatic rifles.

No one needs bump stocks.

No guns for mentally ill.
7300 2018-02-23 15:36:23 #Stocks,#Indexes Probably completion expected is ruled out.  Structure of current SPX curves is such that another emerging bottom signal can complete later today. Hours to go.
7301 2018-02-23 15:36:11 He said ban bumps stocks/rate increasing devices, increase age limit, new background checks, and arm teachers.
7302 2018-02-23 15:36:07 Well duh yes ., you just said nothing has changed in 36 yrs. Did you know Obama legalized bump stocks in 2010 and again in 2015 .,? He’s a DEM 
7303 2018-02-23 15:35:58 Almost every hunting rifle out there is semi-auto. Taking away semi-auto means only bolt-action rifles are legal. With you on bump stocks considering the regs on fully auto. High capacity magazines are too open to personal definition of what constitutes "high"
7304 2018-02-23 15:35:54 Fact..on two occasions Bathroom Barry and his administration approved the sale of bump stocks...ironic isn’t .

7308 2018-02-23 15:34:52 @RepJackBergman I hope youhave the moral strength to vote against NRA positions when they are wrong. Please vote against bump stocks and MSRs. Have you ever heard of crazier marketing than Modern Sporting Rifles for an AR-15?

7314 2018-02-23 15:32:55 4/ My "preference" is to address this epidemic holistically. There is not ONE solution. There is absolutely no reason why any citizen should have access to a semi-automatic rifle, high cap magazines or bump stocks. If they want to shoot them, they can go to a shooting range.
7315 2018-02-23 15:32:46 Oh u mean like saying the vegas shooter shot all those ppl with bump stocks when u can clearly here a M134 mini gun!
7316 2018-02-23 15:32:29 Has Trump picked up stocks/bonds from gun manufacturers?
Did Trump & GOP get more campaign "contributions" (are they bribes?) to promote guns?
More like a cleverly crafted Trump/GOP/NRA ad to sell guns. 
The NRA will benefit greatly if teachers pack heat.
7317 2018-02-23 15:32:27 Finally they’re actually gonna cut bump stocks

7319 2018-02-23 15:31:56 "They'll take away your Second Amendment which we would never allow to happen." Says the guy who is launching major overhaul to reform gun laws: Stronger background checks, age limits, bump stocks, etc.

7321 2018-02-23 15:31:34 NRA: "The media loves mass shootings."

The truth:
Gun stocks and sales go up after a mass shooting.
NRA membership and donations increase following a mass shooting.
Who really benefits after a mass shooting? They do.
7322 2018-02-23 15:31:16 Exactly. My husband has guns, my dad has guns, my son will own those guns. We have rifles and handguns locked in a safe. They are for home protection and hunting and target practice at our ranch, legally. We have no need for assault weapons or bump stocks etc. BAN THEM NOW.
7323 2018-02-23 15:31:09 And he's proposing common sense gun control as well. He's proposed banning bump stocks and large magazines.
7324 2018-02-23 15:30:59 My President, I beg of you not to give into the democrats. Guns are not the problem. Bump stocks not the problem.
7325 2018-02-23 15:30:19 What an airhead...bump stocks have nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment.  This is the type of idiocy that is making it harder for for the people trying to fight for the 2nd amendment.  Also, unless your well versed in Neurology, i'd recommend in keeping your opinions to yourself.
7326 2018-02-23 15:30:09 Buybacks make stocks more attractive to investors by lowering companies’ outstanding share counts, which bolsters per-share earnings.

7331 2018-02-23 15:29:27 but they'll lose about three points in terms of price. "So they'll get nothing," 

Over what time period? certainly not to redemption. If I were American I'd be buying 5 and 10 yr bonds now and holding them to redemption - instead of cash (NOT instead of stocks)
7332 2018-02-23 15:29:14 My husband & I own guns. He was a gun collector. The NRA changed & we’ve opposed them for decades. I want to see bump stocks & guns like the AR-15 banned. When someone is shot by an AR-15 type gun, it does much more physical damage than a normal rifle or handgun would.
7333 2018-02-23 15:28:03 Hey Imran, sorry for my delayed response! It appears the store closest to you which stocks these is our Accrington store!   - Beth
7334 2018-02-23 15:27:38 This is precisely why gun stocks go up in value after a mass shooting...only the NRA profits off the killing of kids
7335 2018-02-23 15:27:33 Your solution? All I hear is bashing but no problem solving. He’s for increasing age limit, banning bump stocks, more extensive background checks. At least there is an effort
7336 2018-02-23 15:27:33 Dude Yak took so many stocks that last one.
7337 2018-02-23 15:27:20 Share buybacks are expected to bounce back this year but analysts are skeptical the resurgence in share buybacks will last. Rising U.S. interest rates will put a damper on debt-fueled corporate buyback binges that many believe have been a key driver behind U.S. stocks’ 9yr rally
7338 2018-02-23 15:27:16 Bingo! And higher yields are toxic for indebted miners. Perfect storm recently was lower Gold, lower Stocks, higher Yields.

7347 2018-02-23 15:25:56 Dave, I don’t think there are a whole lot of people who want ALL guns banned. That’s an extreme position. We want common sense to take over. There is no reason for regular people to have things like automatic weapons or bump stocks and A mentally ill person shouldn’t have access
7348 2018-02-23 15:25:54 That's a disappointment, Mr. President. I've been looking forward to carrying a gun for my protection in two years, I'd have to wait three more. Also, bump stocks aren't the issue, most shootings take place using pistols.
7349 2018-02-23 15:25:53 Short stocks is always a danger seeker affair...
7350 2018-02-23 15:25:43 How about the @NRA opens shooting clubs (w/ fun targets, food, & entertainment) where people are legally obligated to keep their AR-15s, bump stocks, etc?  The military can keep them secure.  Then people can shoot their guns, and the public will be safe.  #NRA
7351 2018-02-23 15:25:42 First time trading stocks all week, made a lil bit of money for the weekend on $LINU
7352 2018-02-23 15:25:11 In the last 100 years, the gun industry has gone from weapons that can shoot infrequently to weapons that can kill dozens a minute. This BS semi versus automatic is a joke. Bump stocks make a semi nearly automatic now.
7353 2018-02-23 15:24:48 @1a Just like bump stocks, silencers, and high-capacity magazines, no one needs an AR-15. Not for self-protection or home safety or hunting. And why do we have to get “permission” from the @NRA to do anything? We didn’t elect them & they don’t own us.
7354 2018-02-23 15:24:34 -Ban Assualt weapons as thought guns are more deadly and it’s harder to save victims when shot with one.

Trump is going to go for the pitiful bill to "enhance" background checks, which just incentivizes states to report basic info. Pitiful.

Slow Bump Stocks by sending it to ATF which has already said it can't regulate them. Congress has to pass an actual  law. They won't.
7360 2018-02-23 15:23:54 Did the good guy with the gun stop the bad guy with a gun?  NO.  @NRA mantra just doesn’t work. More worthless propaganda. We need to ban assault weapons, ban high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks. @realDonaldTrump please note.
7361 2018-02-23 15:23:48 Also bump stocks make it more comfortable. To this, another big "no". You know better than this. Don't abuse us who put you in office. We aren't the killers.

7368 2018-02-23 15:22:39 Tell you what, when they release video(and there IS video, tons of it) of him carrying in all those guns with bump stocks, I will believe it.

7373 2018-02-23 15:20:35 I saw that. At this moment I don't really care. Kids have had their heads blown off. I think 2A advocates should be paranoid. They refuse to agree to even the simplest gun control measures (bump stocks). As these massacres continue, I think their refusal simply raises the stakes.
7374 2018-02-23 15:20:29 Bursa Malaysia must be on a bull mode. Friends messaging me (never before) asking about stocks and boasting how low they bought and selling high. Urghhhhhhhh
7375 2018-02-23 15:20:15 Interest rates are climbing, monumental layoffs, corps investing in buying back stocks, wall streets getting pretty rocky-recession inevitable, increased national debt.....
7376 2018-02-23 15:20:06 I pre-ordered the code realize sequel too since it seems like otomeges sell out fast here bc of the limited stocks ;;;
7377 2018-02-23 15:19:49 I'd prefer the stocks tbh. I have some old fruit and veg I need to get rid of.
7378 2018-02-23 15:19:49 Omg I thought the previous ones have no stocks but now I see 
It’s such a surprise! Can I get all of these four?
Thank you so much you are soooo nice

7380 2018-02-23 15:19:22 “We should probably stop selling assault rifles and bump stocks. They’re not really necessary in any viable circumstance”

NRA: “THE GOVERNMENT HATES US FOR OWNING GUNS AND IS FORCING US TO GIVE THEM ALL UP AND LEAVE US COMPLETELY DEFENSLESS AGAINST OUR ENEMIES”
7381 2018-02-23 15:18:48 Good morning. The left is not attacking the 2A. 2A guarantees right to “bear arms”, not what types of arms. Govt decides what types of arms are allowed. Left, and responsible gun owners, are trying to restrict semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks and HC mags.
7382 2018-02-23 15:18:25 Which organization actively lobbies and campaigns against common sense gun laws? Which one has been sabotaging the government's efforts to enforce gun laws we have? Which organization steadfastly fights for anyone to acquire high powered guns, bump stocks, high capacity mags?
7383 2018-02-23 15:18:14 We can have gun CONTROL without a gun BAN. I’m all for the second amendment, but I’m not down for an 18 year old being able to purchase, or bump stocks, or semiautomatic rifles for the general population.... BIG difference. #guncontrol #GunLawsNOW
7384 2018-02-23 15:18:07 The Dem are going against tax cuts, jobs, investing in America and DACA deals the President offered. And you are lying The President already send to Congress to further regulate rifle purchases to 21, regulate bump stocks, and background check with an emphasis in mental heatlh.
7385 2018-02-23 15:18:01 Traded $TTD long for $3200. So 2 trades on 2 large cap stocks. Total on day +$7455. Had to move into other arenas since small caps are pretty much dead for now. When low float momo returns, will switch back
7386 2018-02-23 15:17:48 Can't Pretend that Placing Regulation on Bump Stocks will Slove Anything @realDonaldTrump Limit Access to the AR-15 and Refund our FBI so they can do more investigation and background checks! #BoycottNRA and Stop Excepting money From them Elected Officials!
7387 2018-02-23 15:17:37 Lower interest rates.. on the bonds...  should be supportive for stocks..  or could happen if stocks crash, then flight to safety (bonds)..
7388 2018-02-23 15:17:26 i was always partial to futures but did trade some stocks. mostly futures spreads when i started part time
7389 2018-02-23 15:17:22 @POTUS  WHY DID YOU HOST PARKLAND MASS SHOOTING SURVIVORS TO WH, JUST TO BETRAY THEM AND TO SUCK UP TO NRA?!  YOU promised them :Banning Bump Stocks; COMPREHENSIVE Background Checks; RAISING age of AR-15 Sells. BE A LEADER
7390 2018-02-23 15:17:14 U clearly aren’t educated on the facts. Bump firing can be achieved w/o bump stocks by loosely holding a gun, or by wrapping rubber bands behind the trigger. Nevertheless, our ability to exercise our rights is not dependent on whether or not there is a “good reason” for doing so.

7393 2018-02-23 15:15:11 "President Trump, what do you think of bump stocks and AR15's?" "Bump stocks are soaring through the roof, the economy is great, no other President has done so much with bump stocks as me, AR15's are great golf clubs, I recommend them, I think I just ordered a dozen".
7394 2018-02-23 15:15:04 @jypnation we are expecting enough stocks of the album, we dont want to see another sold out notice.
7395 2018-02-23 15:14:55 I want all assault weapons and weapons similar to them banned. Like the AR-15. So yes, he is wrong about what liberals want.

But i do want mental health, bump stocks addressed, etc. I know banning guns alone wont fully curb the problem, but doing every possible option likely can
7396 2018-02-23 15:14:55 I read the news and see fire stocks plays but ultimately don't invest because of my conscious and the immoral nature of the companies 
7397 2018-02-23 15:14:50 But in the early years, say mid-2000s, you were trading stocks? Did you start with stocks and move to futures?
7398 2018-02-23 15:14:44 Can’t wait to hear you tout you gun controll message about greater background checks, banning bump stocks, and raising the legal age limit to 21, oh but wait CPAC are Republican NRA supporters, I guess I shouldn’t hold my breath
7399 2018-02-23 15:14:29 Tell me everything you know (without googling it) about bump stocks. Then, create a viable argument to your claim that they should be banned.
7400 2018-02-23 15:14:22 If I were big believer I’d be buying but they have to show me something before I add more at this point. Feel like I’m chasing my tail on all the dips. But, why sell at a loss?
7401 2018-02-23 15:13:52 Mtg stocks
7402 2018-02-23 15:13:36 Implement the following:
1.  Change the legal age to 21 to purchase any type of firearm                    2. Ban Bump Stocks 
3. 7 day waiting period 
4. Expanded NIC/NAC cheeks                  5. Institute Mandatory firearm use and safety class
7403 2018-02-23 15:13:12 Now tell people about the other part where he wants to ban bump stocks which is something you tarts want. Half truths or out right lies with you lot. You are the real deplorable. Have you been reading Saul Alinskys rules for radicals again?

Good start to the day.
In the US the market yields are lower today:
7405 2018-02-23 15:12:41 OPEC is a cartel for the benifit of the oil producers. The LBMA is a cartel for the benifit of the financial industry & the govt bond business. Gold stocks skidded into 2001 lows in 2015 & 16 & tried again at the end of 17 yet nobody wants to talk about it.
7406 2018-02-23 15:12:34 I know semiauto is semiauto. (Until bump stocks are added.) Trying to ban a specific style seems to be a losing battle, but regulate modifications tools. (ARs can be highly modded.) Ensure thorough background checks  on ALL sales and increase waiting periods.
7407 2018-02-23 15:12:26 Since bump stocks don’t do anything that several properly placed rubber bands can do equally well (allow a shooter to pull a trigger slightly faster), no, they shouldn’t be banned. Ur easily manipulated when “sad things happen to children.” (ie Syria) U listening to Ivanka again?
7408 2018-02-23 15:11:40 Yes!!  We knew all along he would be great!  I know my stocks are doing great as well as my paycheck!  It isn’t just that, he honestly cares about this country. When will the left take their blinders off and think for themselves?
7409 2018-02-23 15:11:28 Please please knock stocks down another 16-20% so I can sell some of  Gund’s bonds & buy some more of the most efficient well run growing dividend paying company’s ever known!
7410 2018-02-23 15:11:21 Ironic that they acuse the media of profiting from the shootings when they drum up fear after each one and gun makers stocks soar.
7411 2018-02-23 15:11:13 Again, people want stricter requirements to get guns moving forward (and ban bump stocks). Not coming to your house and taking the ones you have. Are there people who say no one should have guns? Sure. But I have not heard one credible argument that suggests taking your guns away

7414 2018-02-23 15:10:46 There isn’t any fundamental difference between an AR15, available now in several calibers, and any other semi-auto rifle. They all shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger. I do believe devices that turn semi auto to full auto(bump stocks etc) shouldn’t be sold OTC but as CL 3
7415 2018-02-23 15:10:43 Reconsider the bump stock in this. Please do research of your own. It does NOT turn a gun into machine gun capability!!! But yes focus on mental health and background checks and upping the age. NOT. BUMP. STOCKS.

7417 2018-02-23 15:10:05 You can't specifically bet against the market in an IRA (the way you can with stocks via short selling), but there are ETFs called "inverse ETFs" that you could add to an IRA portfolio if your IRA has them. Recommend doing a lot of research before doing so.
7418 2018-02-23 15:09:57 Although I personal think "Bump Stocks" are useless novelty's, I disagree with banning them. All they do is decrease accuracy and water ammo.
7419 2018-02-23 15:09:36 However #Trump ,#GOP,#NRA need to put children’s lives first :
-Close gun shows loop holes
-Ban assault rifles “Ar-15,a k47,bump stocks
-Full background checks  
-raise age limit from 18 to 21
-“No”teachers carrying guns in the classroom
Re- instate Obama’s mental health bill

7421 2018-02-23 15:09:25 Yeah, that's why they have been trying to get better help for those with mental health issues and trying to ban bump stocks..  except the Democrats have stood in the way because it didn't go far enough for them.
7422 2018-02-23 15:09:22 Bump stocks, bump stocks are stupid,  mall ninja neckbeard gun accessories they make your gun operate like it's full auto. I would never own one in my life. But, it's not about that it's about our rights our freedoms are we really a free country we start Banning things

7425 2018-02-23 15:09:02 Trump “recommended” Jeff sessions “propose” regulations to make bump stocks illegal.  Place your bets.
7426 2018-02-23 15:08:52 What’s wrong with: 1.  Changing the legal age to 21 to purchase any type of firearm 2. Banning Bunp Stocks 3. 7 day waiting period 4. Expanded NIC/NAC cheeks  5. Mandatory firearm use and safety class             The US Military & all Law enforcement agencies train in this manner
7427 2018-02-23 15:08:49 moreover, if we start paying them, the sooner they can buy stocks and cryptos
7428 2018-02-23 15:08:43 Does anyone look at history?  Gradual inflation & higher rates in the mid to late 60’s and early 70’s.  Stocks & bonds did just fine.  The global rise out of poverty is the greatest story ever for stocks in general not being told.

7434 2018-02-23 15:07:28 First you accused the DEMs of aiding and abetting the students. Now you say the DEMs have no ideas. DEMs position hasn't changed;
 
BAN BUMP STOCKS

BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS

BAN GUNS FOR MENTALLY ILL

IMPROVE BACKGROUND CHECKS

Republicabs position;

WHAT EVER NRA SAYS.
7435 2018-02-23 15:07:17 You can look at any funds you have and see the stocks they invest in. Check online and if you use a service like Fidelity you can usually see it online through them. If you have individual stocks then of course it’s easy to see what they support and then sell the stock if u want.

7437 2018-02-23 15:07:06 What should be your strategy for the stocks you buy for long-term?

Holding stocks for the long-term doesn't mean that you need to buy and forget.

You must monitor your stocks aggressively and hold them as long as the fundamentals are sound.

7439 2018-02-23 15:06:19 That's cool, I'm with them if that's what they want to do. But (genuine question) do you know why bump stocks are legal (maybe the NRA aren't particularly interested in them)? I can't see why they would be a good idea.

7443 2018-02-23 15:05:05 These Top 25 types of prospects are in the business, at an early age. The NCAA and NBA are huge corporations. And these prospects are future stocks.
7444 2018-02-23 15:04:57 Bump stocks can only function on a semi automatic assault weapon so ban the cause; the semi automatic assault weapon. Mark Twain said "common sense is not all that common ". It's like putting a banAid on an 45mm chest wound and telling the victim you'll be fine.
7445 2018-02-23 15:04:26 Once again, Trump shows he's a true Republican. Started off with  banning bump stocks and restricting guns from mentally challenged, but now back on GOP message of "just add more guns"
7446 2018-02-23 15:04:09 it’s kind of annoying that news sources say snap chat’s stock crashed because of Kylie Jenner smack talking the new update....but like....the whole market was down yesterday so idk why they think people investing in stocks also listen to kylie jenner lmao
7447 2018-02-23 15:04:07 Rick Rule went through another whole interview without mentioning gold stocks once. The submit that the price model for the gold business is flawed. Hence why the sector just perma-capitilates. The sector has been capitulating since April 2013.
7448 2018-02-23 15:03:56 The problem as we have learned over and over is that the politicians will introduce a ban on bump stocks and it will be so poorly worded by idiots with no knowledge of the subject that virtually anything may be banned at some bureaucrat's discretion.
7449 2018-02-23 15:03:48 Start with @NRA drawing a line in the sand on bump stocks. They caved right after Vegas and everyone knows it.
7450 2018-02-23 15:03:42 So you want to keep bump stocks and not treat mental illness? In other words you want to see many children die
7451 2018-02-23 15:03:41 I also think that, against many in the 2A community, bump stocks should be regulated but silencers should not.. 1 makes a weapon more dangerous in rate of fire.. Therefore i believe it should fall inder the 1986 act.. The other quiets the muzzle sound somewhat
7452 2018-02-23 15:03:10 145 days after Las Vegas and now you talk about bump stocks.  Wow!  Nice demonstration of urgency.
7453 2018-02-23 15:02:53 When you ban bump stock s. Etc...Guess who will have bump stocks ...
7454 2018-02-23 15:02:51 Talk is cheap...but so are their stocks.  Somethings gotta give...
7455 2018-02-23 15:02:42 Meaningless. Well over 90% of NRA funding comes from gun makers. If you want to impact the NRA the ONLY way is to pressure institutional investors to divest gun stocks and then VOTE for leaders who commit to vote for commonsense gun laws! Then hold them accountable.
7456 2018-02-23 15:02:41 Lots of people own stocks now though. Isn't that partial ownership at least?
7457 2018-02-23 15:02:37 Arming teachers is a bad idea but even if you do how do you protect those who fall victim to mass shootings in other venues.  That is why you need to change gun laws:  magazine clips, age requirements and universal background checks and no more bump stocks

7462 2018-02-23 15:00:53 He went through another interview without mentioning gold stocks once. That speaks volumes as to how utterly loathed the sector is. And there's no end in sight. The whole price model for gold is flawed. Mark it zero.

7471 2018-02-23 14:57:32 It wasn’t booming? The recession. Real estate was terrible. Businesses were screwed over and not big corporations, small business. Stocks were really flip floppy.

7479 2018-02-23 14:55:27 It's about everything the NRA is against: banning assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks; stricter background checks; common sense.

7483 2018-02-23 14:54:41 Once they got a critical mass of gun liberalization in a bunch of states and federally, they settled into a strategy of not giving an inch on anything - even it was like fucking black talons or silencers or recently bump stocks.
7484 2018-02-23 14:54:36 I'm for banning AR-15's, bump stocks, & high-capacity mags. Also, how cost-prohibitive would it be to have cameras at entrances w/ a single-hire & backup to monitor & ability to lock those doors & notify law enforcement?

7494 2018-02-23 14:53:49 Attitude era was before WWE became a traded company on the stock market. Vince now has to answer to people other than his own to ensure the stocks don't plummet. We may not all like the new direction but if people get over the"it not the Attitude Era" thing its not that bad

7500 2018-02-23 14:52:31 Yes, while gun & ammo stocks are probably hitting the roof!  hahaha.  Capitalism....ahhhhh....sweet freedom
7501 2018-02-23 14:52:19 honestly think this is a little different think we will get better back ground checks rid of those bump stocks? & raise the age for some purchases  but then again you could be right about doing nothing
7502 2018-02-23 14:51:54 I called the NRA about a year ago to discuss bump stocks and they flat out told me that they are for NO regulations whatsoever on guns.
7503 2018-02-23 14:51:42 Now that we’ve had a day to exclaim over the clearly ridiculous “arm teachers” thing, can we start talking about serious policy proposals? Strengthening background checks, for one? Federally mandated, consistent waiting periods? No more bump stocks or AR-15s?
7504 2018-02-23 14:51:26 My finance prof talking about stocks:
“He’s an idiot right and then he started talking about that stupid wall but people were buying and selling” lmfao he just had to throw in the insult
7505 2018-02-23 14:51:24 Just like mass shootings in the US. Banning bump stocks which turn semi-automatics into machine guns will (sadly) NOT stop people from entering schools and committing mass murder. It does, however, make it look like the government cares while receiving $$$$ in donations from NRA
7506 2018-02-23 14:51:24 I think you may be able to if you're already in; not sure
7507 2018-02-23 14:51:10 I can't speak confidently to the taxation of swaps, but this could just as easily be implemented with futures, which are taxed at 60% LTCG / 40% income, which is consistent with 60/40 stocks/bonds...
7508 2018-02-23 14:51:02 Really?  Any search will show Target and Starbucks stocks have declined, and NFL ratings were way down this entire past season.  But you continue living in your own reality.

7516 2018-02-23 14:48:48 $OLED just about to ORB, got ways to fall. Would be surprised to see this below 120 in next couple of days. No growth in growth stocks is easiest short.
7517 2018-02-23 14:48:29 Stocks! :)
7518 2018-02-23 14:48:23 That's the point. Without retrofitting the portfolio to emphasize the assets with the best ex post performance (i.e. US stocks and bonds vs. ex-US), risk parity is still very competitive.
7519 2018-02-23 14:47:58 People don't need weapons of war. They don't need hundreds of rounds of ammunition or bump stocks. It shouldn't be harder to get a drivers license than a gun. We need mental health funding. Teachers are speaking out against being armed. We are better than this.
7520 2018-02-23 14:47:39 Not just AR-15, but AR-15 with bump stocks and high capacity magazines
7521 2018-02-23 14:47:03 So my technology stocks went up by 20 bucks, but my global index stocks went down with -420 bucks. Woo, only -400 bucks xD
7522 2018-02-23 14:46:31 @AnnaKhait bump stocks are sure as hell NOT YOUR RIGHT. They change a semi auto weapon into as much of a fully auto weapon as possible. 

You love jesus and animals but feel okay about innocent children dying in school massacres? 

FACT: gun restrictions save lives. Period.
7523 2018-02-23 14:46:18 @TheYeezyMafiaCA my plug for Canada Stocks
7524 2018-02-23 14:46:01 yup agree. pot stocks still in a correction and all slowly trending down. but come mid march/april IMO.. could be good time to start some long positions again. right now. just day/swing or nothing at all
7525 2018-02-23 14:46:01 #NRA blocks any reasonable gun control measures to the peril of innocents. It is not unreasonable to increase the age requirement, to permit the CDC to study mass shootings, outlaw bump stocks or put a temporary ban on semi-automatic weapons to study its effects. 1/
7526 2018-02-23 14:45:53 Right, as I've mentioned before. Raising the age limit would reduce some killings, banning it would reduce them more I believe. Bump stocks ban would be a bonus, which would reduce how many rounds said weapon can fire per minute. Finding a middle ground is not easy.
7527 2018-02-23 14:45:42 40% of US 60/40 is taxed as income, which puts swaps and 60/40 stocks/bonds on a pretty even footing.
7528 2018-02-23 14:45:21 Did you ever trade stocks?
7529 2018-02-23 14:45:06 If you notice, Trump hasn't mentioned bump stocks since his listening session. He wasn't serious so we must ignore him and fight for what we want which is a total ban on all assault weapons, kits and accessories.
7530 2018-02-23 14:44:48 It was NOT a ban. It prohibited flash suppressors, 30-rd magazines, bayonet lugs, some collapsed stocks. cosmetics. Strengthen background  , age restiction, emergency restrain orders. #bumpstocks #backgroundchecks #AR15 #standwiththekids #BREAKING #Trump #GOPComplicit

7533 2018-02-23 14:44:21 John's suggestions are good, though crypto has enough upside that I think it's worth dabbling in with a few percent. Besides intl stocks and stable assets, look into other passive income streams - highly automated small business? A popular book with royalties?
7534 2018-02-23 14:44:14 @SuzanneEvans1 @hendopolis What will happen to the existing stocks of plastic straws,of which there must be millions?
7535 2018-02-23 14:44:04 Just a little fun! We're always glad to see new film stocks :)

7538 2018-02-23 14:43:33 Listen up President Trump; if you ban bump stocks, a significant amount of your base will ban you during  the 2020 elections. Don’t let the Democraps divide us. Democraps hate you and will never vote for you, never ever, ever....

7542 2018-02-23 14:43:09 Trump is the only President taking gun violence in school seriously, he is the FIRST President to hold such listening & talking sessions with real victims & law enforcement agencies. His proposal is practical: raise gun ownership age, ban bump stocks, tighten background check...
7543 2018-02-23 14:42:41 My 45 holds 7 rounds, if I'm not experienced in aiming and shooting in a life and death situation I'm missing most. The NYPD hits 34% targets. They train constantly. The AR has removable clips that hold up to 30 rounds each. Bump stocks still legal which make them fully auto
7544 2018-02-23 14:42:38 I agree with mental health and bump stocks. But how can any president ask a 18 year old .To serve his country possibly give his life in battle for a commander and chief who says . Here is a AR 15 to kill the enemy's. But you can't buy a deer hunting rifle.If you live to come home
7545 2018-02-23 14:42:05 @TrueCar you The @NRA is a lobbying organization for the gun manufacturers.  They actively lobby against every single common sense gun legislation proposed including universal background checks and bump stocks thereby allowing gun massacres.  Is this what you stand for? Killing?

7554 2018-02-23 14:39:49 Banning bump stocks? You could take a rubber band and rig it to an AR-15 and it be the same principle. It just allows your finger to reset faster on the trigger, to be able to shoot faster. They've already banned other stocks.
7555 2018-02-23 14:39:30 I think as long as they make bump stocks illegal ar-15's are fine, then it's basically a big pistol.
7556 2018-02-23 14:39:24 @realDonaldTrump Okay time for gun reform I will give up 40 plus round magazines PLUS BUMP STOCKS for FULL  Reciprocity
7557 2018-02-23 14:39:19 Metal stocks like Jindal, Steel, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Vedanta and Hindalco gained 3-5% on account of increased based metal price on LME and strong domestic demand.

7561 2018-02-23 14:38:15 President Trump will say anything, especially when he knows that his words are unlikely to have any consequence, as in the case of the gun debate. He'll continue to boast fake actions like the memorandum about bump stocks, and has no problem parroting NRA heads the next day.

7564 2018-02-23 14:37:28 @POTUS @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @GOP @NRA @RepErikPaulsen  Gee, another shooting.  Guess we missed the chance to prevent "the next one".  So let's skip the thoughts and prayers and get to work on gun control laws NOW.
No assault weapons - no gun bump stocks. #NoMoreShootings
7565 2018-02-23 14:37:23 WRONG Lib 
1. The bump stock was outlawed under President Bush in 2005.

2. The Obama Administration reversed this decision legalizing bump stocks in 2010.

3. NO lobbying effort by the NRA, Republicans or conservatives for legalizing bump stocks. This was team Obama's decision

7568 2018-02-23 14:36:54 I’m starting to lean more bullish on crypto. We’ve been in a bear market for a couple of months but I think we’ll be doing really well by June. Honestly don’t follow stocks too much, I let people smarter than me handle mine 
7569 2018-02-23 14:36:38 also, “low return environment” for stocks from 2014 I think
7570 2018-02-23 14:36:29 That's not an easy to hide gun. That's one of my issues with M4 stocks and short barrels.
7571 2018-02-23 14:36:27 You have President Trump tweeting support for raising the purchasing age to 21, banning bump stocks, and tougher background checks, all of which the NRA oppposes, none of which Trump was talking about after the Vegas shooting. So maybe something will change this time. We’ll see.
7572 2018-02-23 14:36:06 Trump did. Ban on gun stocks already by order of the President!!
7573 2018-02-23 14:36:03 Apple is next... then idk i need some good penny stocks
7574 2018-02-23 14:35:42 Assault weapons are mostly banned, already. I do not support a ban on modern hunting rifles such as the #AR15. I do support the ban on bump stocks. #ArmaLiteRifle15 #ColtArmaLite
7575 2018-02-23 14:35:00 I don’t know what a bump stock is... does it matter? Any gun can kill someone. To go as deep as certain kind of stocks is dumb. How about we raise the cost of bullets!!!
7576 2018-02-23 14:34:55 .@waynelapierrejr and the @NRA can stop sending me requests for donations if they dont stop compromising on the #2ndAmendment . No doubt in my mind bump stocks were a ridiculous compromise. They know full well devices arent needed for bump fire. #nra @realDonaldTrump #tcot #gop

7582 2018-02-23 14:32:55 It's not a right, but a privilege. It's in the amendments to defend against the possibility of tyranny within our gov't. Doesn't say bump stocks. When did you stop caring about kids and innocent people? Is it because killing them isn't an amendment?
7583 2018-02-23 14:32:54 Absolutely anyting that is a military style weapon or uses the same ammo high capacity magazine can be made automatic with bump stocks and Trigger twists should be banned! ANY MILITARY STYLE WEAPON! I've seen what they can do up close and personal! No military weapons 4 civilians

7586 2018-02-23 14:32:14 How exactly will you and/or your "well organized militia", be a check and balance on the U.S. government? How, specifically, will the owning of guns, such as AR-15's with bump stocks, help you be a check and balance on the U.S. government?

7592 2018-02-23 14:30:19 You said that the NRA blocked legislation that caused people to die. No one has died due to their opposition to bump stocks as they haven’t been used since the attempt. Prior to that it was the last administration (Obama) that decided it was unnecessary
7593 2018-02-23 14:30:10 Bank nifty is likely to move up in the coming days.
7594 2018-02-23 14:29:45 Nah I’m leaving this here, I don’t have anything else to say.  Yes I’m glad he wants to ban bump stocks, but when you reverse the mental health patients being allowed to purchase guns it’s pitiful.  He should of left it alone and added the ban on bump stocks.
7595 2018-02-23 14:29:37 Anna good argument, this is a tough one. Bump stocks to me ranks right up there with hand grenades. Cool to have them. But I'm sure you see my point.  For all out there i am ex military 11b,  infantryman, ranger etc and Was a Major when i got out. This wii be a tough nut to crack

7612 2018-02-23 14:24:27 Which is to say that anyone can do a multitude of things to get around or mimic discouraged or banned acts/behavior. While I'm not in favor of bump stocks, to say they are the issue is foolish.
7613 2018-02-23 14:24:12 NRA is on board with banning bump stocks and improving the NICS system. 

Background checks on private sales is useless as crime with guns purchased privately is almost non-existent. Illegal straw purchases are a bigger problem.
7614 2018-02-23 14:24:10 Fine, let them be absolutist about this. If they are unwilling to help find solutions or compromise their stance, then we should have no worries pushing as hard as we can to get rid of semiautomatic weapons, hi-capacity clips, bump stocks, silencers and preventing concealed-carry
7615 2018-02-23 14:24:02 Trump just spent the last 2 days with shooting victims n families. N he's pushing for age to be raised on rifles n shotguns n banding bump stocks. Liberals are for gun control why do nothing for 8yrs while oblumber was in office? 300 school shoots in 4yrs unacceptable!
7616 2018-02-23 14:23:12 The day after Trump was elected stock markets took note and stocks started soaring. Based on this, major US corporations overseas agreed to return home with their billions kept off-shore. That had a direct impact on our overall economy. The economists all admit this. Can you?
7617 2018-02-23 14:22:37 Ask you stock advisor or retirement organization to help you divest yourself of gun stocks  and funds that invest in them (until there is reform) and any organization that supports the @NRA #gunreformnow #BoycottNRA #neveragain #walkforourlives
7618 2018-02-23 14:22:22 Do uou know of another president that listen to the ordinary people affected then  planned with public input and then took action?  Nope u cannot name one. Already banned the gun stocks or whatever that was. Already recommended age 21 on buying. Wait till purchase and background
7619 2018-02-23 14:22:19 How about we keep it simple for your simple minds? Ban AR-15's, bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines. I don't think that's too much to ask.
7620 2018-02-23 14:21:57 Just the meme image by itself would convey the attempted joke. At most, you could have a caption such as: "tfw trump bans bump stocks but magaites be like: (image)"

I mean, better not to make this cringey and vulgar non-joke in the first place, but if you're going to do it...
7621 2018-02-23 14:21:00 pre-market very nice! but do remember if u chase, need to lock gains quick UNLESS stocks b/o key resistance levels
7622 2018-02-23 14:20:57 Trump is the President taking gun violence in school seriously, he is the FIRST President to hold such listening & talking sessions with real victims & law enforcement agencies. His proposal is practical: raise gun ownership age, ban bump stocks, tighten background check...
7623 2018-02-23 14:20:34 US large cap stocks are being valued on inflated/financially-engineered earnings expectations that are being used as sustainable growth rates & according PEG ratios based on that growth rate.

7626 2018-02-23 14:19:58 Well I believe raising the age to 21 to purchase these deadly weapons as well as banning bump stocks and universal background checks. Three proposals right there that most Americans agree with and the NRA opposes.
7627 2018-02-23 14:19:57 Was reading a recipe earlier and realized I had both chicken and beef stock in my fridge. Is this adulting.. being fully stocked in stocks?

7630 2018-02-23 14:19:13 I believe the fear in the sane ones is once you remove or drastically alter one amendment will it stop just at the second one? He has also discussed more stringent backgrounds & banning bump stocks but you won’t read those comments in certain publications.
7631 2018-02-23 14:18:55 With  taxpayers money boost #pnb stocks looks  hot  buy  but  geetanjali gems stocks will b reduced to toilet paper.
7632 2018-02-23 14:18:54 Ace investor #RakeshJhunjhunwala has suggested to not invest on your own in the upcoming bull run, but to rely on your fund managers and let them do the job.

However, if you can pick your stocks wisely and know the art, this time everything is cheaper, at a Supermarket Discount.
7633 2018-02-23 14:18:20 So is it infringing on second amendment rights to make bump stocks illegal?
7634 2018-02-23 14:17:50 Join the NRA a great organization of great people. Assault rifles sales are probably thru the roof and bump stocks.
7635 2018-02-23 14:17:27 Just read a reply thread about bump stocks... the defenders’ only good reason to keep them are “muh rights” and “alcohol and tobacco kill more people why aren’t they banned?” The whataboutism Trump has promoted has tainted his whole following, and a redirect is not an argument...
7636 2018-02-23 14:17:24 Loesch is right. Y'all need to get smarter about guns and hit the NRA, gun-nuts, & aspiring mass shooters where it hurts: ban high-capacity magazines. Going after bump stocks and AR-15's alone is futile when other similar guns and identical accessories are still on the market.
7637 2018-02-23 14:17:21 ALL of what @realDonaldTrump  proposed -- raising the age limits on purchasers of rifles from 18 to 21, tightening background checks & banning the sale of bump stocks will keep me as a Republican in 2020. @FoxNewsSunday @SpeakerRyan @tedcruzsenate

7641 2018-02-23 14:16:45 Nobody gets that in the news. Yet as a CCW and multi-gun owner, I am in favor of common sense changes. Bump stocks (I know you can make them) are stupid to sell. I would also support raising the age to purchase semi-autos. Adults no longer train up children.

7644 2018-02-23 14:16:06 If your argument is to allow them to be armed to the extent we allow police then your argument SHOULD be to end bump stocks, limit clips, comprehensive background checks, and limit assault rifles to only extremely experienced and qualified. Such as the police who protect us do.
7645 2018-02-23 14:16:04 It's also good to make sure the law you are advocating for isn't already on the books. Make NICS work. Make straw purchasers do serious time. Make arrests for violence mandatory (even for minors).  Ban bump stocks & raise the age for all gun purchases to 21.
7646 2018-02-23 14:15:53 SELLOUTS! Folding to political pressure is why your stocks will dramatically drop & business suffer
7647 2018-02-23 14:14:36 Well, bump firing is a shooting technique that uses recoil to assist with pulling the trigger on a semi-automatic at a faster rate than otherwise possible. The stocks just help you complete the technique. You can do it without them.
7648 2018-02-23 14:14:30 #Stocks,#Indexes Cancel that. We await the SPX (presumed) completion.

7651 2018-02-23 14:13:15 Pretty much it is. No where in the definition does it actually address any characteristics that make it a more lethal weapon than a standard handgun. Things like folding or collapsible stocks? How does that make it a weapon of war?

7654 2018-02-23 14:12:40 There is no budget for this insane idea, no insurance company going to take this on W/O a prohibitive cost; NRA & politicians know that. When they ban bump stocks Millions will say, "Thank God they didn't arm teachers!" & again, NOTHING to address the issues of ez access to guns
7655 2018-02-23 14:12:35 Bump stocks being a right was in the Bible, you know.
7656 2018-02-23 14:12:31 @TDAJJKinahan doesnt analyze that large cap stocks are being valued on inflated/finan-engineered earnings expectations, used as sustainable growth rates & accorded PEG ratios based on that growth rate. Natural,sustainable growth rates are much lower,PEs are too hi. @SquawkStreet
7657 2018-02-23 14:12:12 Bump stocks are not a gun. They are an upgrade to a gun. They have purpose to citizens. These are for military. I am a gun owner and hunter who likes to have fun and enjoy myself target shooting. But human life is more important then that. And this upgrade to a gun is unnecessary
7658 2018-02-23 14:11:57 Now that NOW TELECOM is considered the third telco player, it's time to invest on their stocks(NOW CORP). For sure kapag nag go-live na sila, tataas value nila. 
7659 2018-02-23 14:10:58 I think it is fair to say that those who support the marketing of high-capacity ammo clips, bump stocks or any modifications to guns are enabling the mass slaughter of school children & teachers.
The NRA supports this marketing.
If you support the NRA , you support mass murder
7660 2018-02-23 14:10:45 @FoxNews The FBI and local security county officer. Failed at school shooting. Now Trump is pulling bump stocks and raising age for rifle sales. Why not take care of the ball droppers first?
7661 2018-02-23 14:10:33 An assault rifle has detachable clips and 2 or more modifications notably folding stocks and pistol grips. Makes them light deadly and easy to maneuver. Similar rules get pistols and shotguns classified. Also 10 round mags are max

7666 2018-02-23 14:09:49 our president is now going to ban bump stocks because they can make these weapons more deadly and they aren’t necessary to have.
7667 2018-02-23 14:09:40 The plan now is to buy several financial, energy & marijuana stocks with dividends and have the dividends pay us a quarterly income when we retire.
7668 2018-02-23 14:09:35 Arming teachers is folly on so many levels. Trump thinks all military serve 20 years, then go into teaching, & want to do SWAT duty. This isn't even a good plot for a movie. Ban Assault weapons & bump stocks.

7671 2018-02-23 14:08:25 The more gun nuts push back on minor limitations like banning bump stocks, assault rifles, etc as dumb, the more they make the case for an outright private weapons ban.
7672 2018-02-23 14:08:20 of who is carrying. I thought bump stocks were already out. I hope you use metal detectors and cameras to secure the perimeter. Good luck. You are doing well.
7673 2018-02-23 14:08:03 The problem are trump, you and all the republicans than lust lie, acuse every one for the dumb mistakes, filled up your pockets at the cost of so many lives and never take  responsability. He can brag about the stocks now! Worst president ever!
7674 2018-02-23 14:07:54 Come in Trump, you're supposed to fight FOR gun rights. Bump stocks don't do anything but increase the comfort of shooting a gun if you're shooting sport for a long time. Don't give in to them like the NRA DID!!
7675 2018-02-23 14:07:17 In a general rising yield environment you have to discount it by those generally rising yield... this comparison doesnt tell reality. Actually credit is generally stronger than stocks.

7683 2018-02-23 14:05:35 THIS IS GOOD!  STOP SUPPORTING THE NRA UNTIL THEY REALIZE THAT ASSAULT RIFLES (TOTAL BAN OR AT LEAST 21 Y/O TO PURCHASE), STOP BUMP STOCKS, REMOVE THE LOOPHOLES ON PRIVATE SALES, AND BETTER CHECKS ( IF ON TERROR WATCH LIST, CAN BUY A WEAPON... OH, PLS!).  THIS IS GOOD START!

2. Ban high capacity magazines
3. Ban armor-piercing bullets
4. Ban personal ownership of assault weapons but allow use in gun ranges
5. Require registration of ALL guns
6. Require 3 day waiting period for purchase
7. Fix background check system

7693 2018-02-23 14:03:44 excellent, Mr. President. Ban the sale of bump stocks. As long as we keep the 2nd Amendment. More institutions for mentally unstable. They have no where to be treated and kept until deemed mentally stable. Protect us from the crazies.

7695 2018-02-23 14:02:44 Can you please fact check the spokeswoman about when she bought her first gun and or rifle An her first AR-15. And the NRA does not want to ban Bump stocks or raise the age to purchase.
7696 2018-02-23 14:02:40 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX presumably emerging bottom signal cannot complete until 1000 at the earliest. Still, there is no guarantee it will complete. We have, however, never observed only the NDX to bottom-signal. The odds are overwhelmingly SPX bottom signal will complete.
7697 2018-02-23 14:02:16 Buybacks make sense if a stock is undervalued. Otherwise they’re a waste of cash. Time will tell if these stocks are undervalued or not. Nothing to do with prices. If I decide not to buy a car this year somehow I should start charging clients less?

7704 2018-02-23 14:01:23 There are a lot of small steps you can take to ensure guns aren't available to these people.
• stringent background checks
• ban for domestic abusers
• ban for those on no fly list
• ban on bump stocks
Are you going to lead these legislations for your constituents?
7705 2018-02-23 14:00:43 They actually supported a ban on bump stocks after Las Vegas shooting, a move that many of their members disagreed with. Everything they stand for is the same thing a large portion of our country stands for. They don’t profit off of fear, they profit off of patriotism.
7706 2018-02-23 14:00:43 Words like "Terrifying" "Conspiracy" linked to "Socialism" makes for a great sales pitch. Mass shootings must be a bonanza for the #NRA and their benefactors. "FEAR" real or imaginary SELLS Guns. Buy your bump stocks now!!! Don't wait & leave you & your family defenceless

7726 2018-02-23 13:55:01 The relationship between the bonds and stocks aren’t clear-cut and that the fluctuations of the yield curve is just another factor to consider in the interplay between the two assets.
7727 2018-02-23 13:54:39 @realDonaldTrump Sir I voted for the first time and I voted for you, but the laws are there, getting rid of bump stocks won’t stop a criminal drug dealers or ganger, it’s already tuff to get a ccw, all you will do is make it harder for law abiding citizens. No gun free zones!
7728 2018-02-23 13:54:09 If we start raising ages on "dangerous" things, we should just do it across the board. Driving, voting, age of consent for everything. Bump stocks, my issue is a slippery slope.
7729 2018-02-23 13:54:00 The IGC raised the potential for a further drop in #world grain stocks in 2018-19 too, restating a forecast from last month that wheat inventories will drop over next season, and proposing that corn stocks may fall too.
7730 2018-02-23 13:53:48 Their responsibility is to gun manufacturers. The responsibility for this ison the #GOP Congress whose responsibility is to Americans. Limit @NRA influence. Tell your stock advisors or fund mgrs that you don't wantnyour money in gun or @NRA supporting stocks. #BoycottNRA
7731 2018-02-23 13:53:36 No! And here we go again, mention gun laws and gun owners freak out. This is sick! 

All I and many others want is, stop selling guns to minors, 25 even, ban bump stocks, public shld not be able to buy military stuff. 

NO other country worldwide is putting up with this!
7732 2018-02-23 13:53:35 That and bump stocks.
7733 2018-02-23 13:53:22 He also said it first that he was going to pass legislation to ban bump stocks and the kits that make semi-automatic weapons automatic and then that just went away when he got his cheat sheet from the NRA!

7734 2018-02-23 13:53:18 I’m all for the mental health screening, but honestly raising the minimum age won’t do anything, if you raise the minimum age to buy a gun raise the voting age too! Bump stocks, meh full auto isn’t practical

7736 2018-02-23 13:52:57 Because of the left, if you give them anything it will take it over the top. Case in point, gay marriage, Christian baker. I don't even like bump stocks but it won't end there.
7737 2018-02-23 13:52:27 How much will you make on the sale of these guns to teachers? Another donation from the NRA. Is this what will be done with the bump stocks
7738 2018-02-23 13:51:32 #1-owning a semi-auto weapon/HC mags/bump stocks is not a “right”. It’s an option allowed by the Fed govt.
#2-our desire to ban these items is not “based on the actions of one deranged person”, but on the actions of *every* mass murderer who used them to kill unarmed innocents.
7739 2018-02-23 13:51:20 Well yeah the bar is set pretty low for Trump. But he’s proposed banning bump stocks, universal background checks (which I agree with), and wants to raise the age to buy to 21 (which I don’t). But these are more productive than shouting at the NRA or slaying it on twitter

Huge win compromise

And I bet this is a power play by Trump to appeal to both sides on this

Can't ask for it one sided and expect it to pass or keep you in office

7744 2018-02-23 13:49:20 Be shouldn't there be some laws to stop some or more people? I think that's what some teens are asking for. That maybe large clips and bump stocks to trample the freedoms of Americans. Maybe I'm just too simple minded.
7745 2018-02-23 13:48:39 I heard he has suggested regulating "bump stocks" which make semi automatic guns fire more like automatic guns. But I have also read  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) isn't sure they can without Congress passing a law.

7755 2018-02-23 13:46:37 I believe it was a memorandum & no EO or law has been put into place yet. Bump stocks are shitty anyway, you can get the same effect with a rubber band. Agreed though that banning an accessory is ridiculous.

7759 2018-02-23 13:44:35 The solution to mass shootings in our schools is not more guns. It is common sense gun reform.  No more assault weapons and bump stocks.

7788 2018-02-23 13:40:01 Just ban all assault weapons, magazines with more than 5 bullets, bump stocks, suppressors. Ban American Taliban @NRA.

7810 2018-02-23 13:35:14 I have a idea, instead of #BanAssaultWeapons and bump stocks why not make then a NFA item subject to extreme background checks, a tax stamp, a lot of paperwork, and around a 3 month to 1 year wait time. NFA items are almost never used in crime because of how hard they are to get

7815 2018-02-23 13:34:47 He banned bump stocks this week.  That is gun control.  Can't agree on Romney.  We see it working out the same as when he endorsed McCain--badly.  We gain one more NeverTrump RINO when we could have had someone who supports MAGA if Trump had supported him/her..
7816 2018-02-23 13:34:32 We cannot allow any more infringements to our God given rights. Bump stocks are gay, but banning them is a infringement.
7817 2018-02-23 13:34:16 Without a doubt we must do better beginning with securing our schools, tightening background checks, banning bump stocks, improving early warning notification at schools and thru mental providers. Lots to do.
7818 2018-02-23 13:33:56 I agree 100% I enjoy hunting, I’m a 10 yr vet. Everyone yelling ban semi auto doesn’t fully understand that even a revolver with 5 shots is semi auto. Large magazines and bump stocks are an issue.
7819 2018-02-23 13:33:46 So far I can see the possibility of bump stocks getting pulled, and the age of gun ownership going up to 21. Hope those kids keep the pressure on, they are doing great so far.

7825 2018-02-23 13:32:15 Even if people believe banning bump stocks and the 21 age limit on semi-autos are "common sense" gun regulations. Dems wont stop. As we saw with the CNN mob "town hall" they want a full ban of everything.
7826 2018-02-23 13:31:36 How many more kids have to die before you act ? The actions you have suggested will not harm the NRA one bit why dont you issue an executive order banning all assault weapons banning all bump stocks banning all assault weapons ammunition it's well within your powers ? 2/3
7827 2018-02-23 13:31:10 Yes, I'm a gun owner. Why don't you ask the military why they use assault rifles over heavy wood hunting models? Lighter, easier to carry, collapsible stocks makes turning corners and swinging weapon easier to wield in urban environments. They're not called CQB for no reason.
7828 2018-02-23 13:30:50 Who cares about Bump Stocks...as a former Marine who in 8 years never qualified below expert I can say that I can fire faster with a stock semi auto than anyone with a Bump Stock..they're a useless gimmick

2. Automatic weapons are illegal.

3. By definition bump stocks are illegal and those who sell need jail time

7848 2018-02-23 13:23:20 Not a financial expert, but it's probably better to diversify your investments than bet direct against same thing you're betting for. International stocks, bonds, real estate, maybe small amt in precious metals. I'd avoid investments you don't understand, fads (e.g. crypto*).
7849 2018-02-23 13:23:04 Hey @Snapchat if you're losing money in stocks and everyone is still pissed at your app why don't you fix it?! Not bug fixes. Switch the whole thing back! Love everyone who is now forced to use stupid instastories.
7850 2018-02-23 13:22:49 PATHETIC display of NRA dysfunction. NRA is out of step with the majority of the public. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS NOW. BAN, BAN, BAN their sale to the public no matter their age. License those that are out there now so police know who has them now.
7851 2018-02-23 13:22:34 I actually would like to boycott the NRA because they are trying to ban bump stocks.
7852 2018-02-23 13:22:29 This window is mega dangerous for traders-some of ur stocks may get zapped fatally.
7853 2018-02-23 13:22:04 See how influence works. Kylie Jenner a 20-year-old said she is not feeling snapchat anymore since the update..all of a sudden snapchat's stocks have fallen dramatically.

7857 2018-02-23 13:20:16 Metals were supported by a weaker dollar and by speculation that Chinese copper demand will rebound with the end of the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Precious metals prices were undercut by the rally in stocks that reduced the safe-haven demand for precious metals.
7858 2018-02-23 13:20:07 Tilly bump stocks are not the issue and neither are guns! We have the right to bear arms! It is called the second amendment! We have the right for a reason and a bump stock is not going to change hardly anything about firing a weapon, uf you want you can get very fast at it!
7859 2018-02-23 13:20:00 Yes... bump stocks, high cap mags, flash suppressors, silencers.
7860 2018-02-23 13:19:50 No doubt @realDonaldTrump owns stocks in Gun Manufacturing.
7861 2018-02-23 13:19:47 Good thing they are a private company. Their stocks would be oh so low right now.
7862 2018-02-23 13:19:19 If you want to spray fire on large groups of people you can legally buy a bump stock that basically makes your gun a wildly inaccurate machine gun. That's what the Vegas shooter used. Bump Stocks should have been banned the next day.
7863 2018-02-23 13:19:15 If you shorted stocks yesterday, you should retire from trading today. This isn't for you. Hang it up and hand in your book.
7864 2018-02-23 13:18:37 You'd probably do well to not encourage me to do anything that Trump does :)

They get partial credit. Bump stocks are not a high volume item, so as a concession it's a minor one.
7865 2018-02-23 13:18:35 @SenBlumenthal @Morning_Joe Senator, you have my support on banning assault weapons & bump stocks sales. Increase background checks & mental health investigation when public buys guns. Listen to the public outcry. Assault weapons are for hunting people, not animals.
7866 2018-02-23 13:18:33 Large financial companies who continue to invest in gun company stocks are as responsible so let’s not forget them. Every American with a 401-k should be asking whether gun makers are in their portfolio. It’s the gun makers as much as the @NRA. they hide behind them.
7867 2018-02-23 13:18:26 The S&P 500 on Thursday also closed higher on comments from Fed Governor Quarles who said the U.S. economy is in the "best shape" since the crisis. There was also strength in energy stocks after crude oil prices rose +1.77% to a 2-week high.

They're saying yes get bump stocks off the shelf. They're saying raise the age of purchase. THATS HUGE! #MarchForOurLives

7873 2018-02-23 13:16:41 Gop stopped bills that over reached. Example all agreed to ban bump stocks dems wanted more so they pushed added accessories that made the bill fail. Congratulations.

7875 2018-02-23 13:15:20 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I know Parkland was truly horrible. However please don't go banning bump stocks or AR-15 style rifles cause they were used by a few terrible individuals that don't respect other peoples lives. That is why I voted for you and the wall.

7880 2018-02-23 13:11:43 All semi-automatics and accessories should be banned.  If you hunt or defend at home, you only need a few shots.  So the answer is yes.  No bump stocks or adapters.  Sorry rich entitled people, the party's over.

7889 2018-02-23 13:10:03 Re: mass shootings: Most shooters have been over 21 or have obtained their guns illegally or from parents; bump stocks aren't used often. Raising minimum ages and/or banning bump stocks does NOT solve the problem. #ParklandStrong

7900 2018-02-23 13:05:57 No prob banning bump stocks - background checks already in place - we’ll see what else you chuckleheads have in mind.

Seems there’s an attempt to ban “assault weapons” - not sure what that is - but most libdems seem to think its “scary looking semi-automatic rifles”
7901 2018-02-23 13:04:46 @realDonaldTrump you have a moment here to gain the respect of many people by reforming gun laws. No assault rifle sales, stronger background checks and ban bump stocks.  Show that NRA doesn’t own you!!!
7902 2018-02-23 13:04:31 USDA Outlook Forum: Projects 2018/19 Corn production at 14.390 billion bu vs 2017/18 at 14.604 billion. Yield estimated at 174.0 bpa. US 2018/19 corn ending stocks forecasted at 2.272 billion bu vs 2.352 in 2017/18
7903 2018-02-23 13:04:21 Raising the age is useless; symbolic. Outlawing bump stocks is useless; symbolic. Deeper background checks; what does that even mean; useless symbolism. Controlled access and armed school faculty; that will work.
7904 2018-02-23 13:04:20 If you got attach bump stocks to children I bet the NRA would care a lot more about protecting them. #BoycottNRA
7905 2018-02-23 13:03:56 @SenateGOP @HouseGOP The public will now be investigating who there’s accepting NRA donations & voting against you next election. BAN purchase of bump stocks & AR-15s by the public NOW! They shd be used by military only. You need to listen to the American public not the NRA.
7906 2018-02-23 13:03:25 Ban bump stocks. Keep age at 18

7908 2018-02-23 13:01:27 Trump wasn't even in politics when this all happened. Obama had a chance to ban bump stocks but he didnt
7909 2018-02-23 13:01:24 Hey @GOP & @realDonaldTrump, don’t forget that the @NRA is NOT a governing body. It literally does not matter if they agree or disagree that the purchase age for rifles should be raised or bump stocks be banned (or semi-automatic weapons, for that matter).STOP TAKING THEIR MONEY.
7910 2018-02-23 13:01:16 I’m assuming you meant “their stock”. How many stocks does it take to have n influence on their corporate decisions?

7915 2018-02-23 12:59:46 I dunno, Ann. Bump stocks are a fad that destroy your groupings. 
7916 2018-02-23 12:58:12 what are you telling me youre against the idea of buying stocks that only go up in value if the price of gold goes down??? totally normal and understandable things like futures???
7917 2018-02-23 12:58:05 I'm a gun owner and it is fucked up. The NRA is batshit crazy and horrible. There is zero need for a civilian to have an AR-15 or other tactical semi-automatic rifles. Bump stocks should be banned. More robust ATF databases. CDC allowed to research. I could go on.
7918 2018-02-23 12:56:55 He also said raise the age to purchase rifles and ban bump stocks.  Did he not?  I agree it teachers want to be armed they should be.  But let’s keep the conversation going and not stop on one subject!
7919 2018-02-23 12:56:52 It’s crazy how many rifle experts we have now a days. Using terms like “bump stock” when you can’t even tell me what it is without googling it. Oh btw for you Democrats, Obama administration gave their ok for Bump Stocks in 2010.
7920 2018-02-23 12:56:24 Anyone who doesn't like this type of volatility, shouldn't be trading these types of stocks.  The volatility (both downs and ups) is shown on my public track record.
7921 2018-02-23 12:56:18 who’s “picking fights” or “offended” you just made comment so I can exercise my right to comment back. Trump raised the age to 21, banned bump stocks and has stricter background checks. I mean that’s legislation
7922 2018-02-23 12:56:03 Buku wajib di pasar stocks
7923 2018-02-23 12:54:34 Say what you really mean and mean what you say. Because you appear mean by not standing with us against banning bump stocks and assault rifles, which has No Impact Whatsoever on 2Nd Amendment.
7924 2018-02-23 12:54:22 Since bump stocks are just a toy for adults we need to keep it out of the hands of children so Banning a toy should not be that upsetting to you what's a toy in comparison to a life that's the question not because it's your right it's not a right
7925 2018-02-23 12:54:07 Multi facet approach. Though Trump failed miserably to put human life over blood money,  let him make his changes ( raise age to 21, ban gun bump stocks, add a waiting period and enhanced background checks). 
MEANWHILE the rest of the country will be DISARMING THE NRA.

7937 2018-02-23 12:51:52 Arming Teachers to Combat Gunman with #AR15MurderMachines (many of which are now fully automatic because of bump stocks) IS LIKE Giving a Scalpel to a Carpenter with No Medical Training to do Brain Surgery on a critically ill patient. #EffectiveGunLaws #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
7938 2018-02-23 12:51:40 Lucy the problem is AR15 is not an assault weapon since it is semi-automatic not fully auto as assault weapons are.  You can ban bump stocks, increase background checks and raise the age to purchase AR15.
7939 2018-02-23 12:50:13 No ban on bump stocks. Ban cowardly cops who allow a shooting to take place, 4 minutes, while safely taking a position outside the school.

7942 2018-02-23 12:49:50 Bump stocks are not the big deal people thing they are. Originally intended for handicapped people.

7946 2018-02-23 12:48:43 Stock buybacks aren't free for corporations; they reduce cash holdings. The $1,000 cost to buy back stocks in your example drops the equity value to $4,000, or still $5 per share. There may still be advantageous for corporations but your argument is both simplistic and flawed.
7947 2018-02-23 12:48:28 Those investors that returned? Major carnage to U.S stocks ahead! Not behind! You will soon find out. Treasury borrowing & soaring rates will be here for a long time! So will declining U.S stocks!

7964 2018-02-23 12:39:29 I’m sorry but, Bump Stocks are an add on novelty item designed allow a semi automatic rifle to function in a mode of cyclic, repeat fire. A machine gun. Any inference  of any justification under the Americans with Disabilities Act is pure, unadulterated Bologna.
7965 2018-02-23 12:38:44 Agreed. Ultimately, we need to get Assault Rifles off the market. Stringent background checks. Ban bump stocks. These are good starts.
7966 2018-02-23 12:38:34 Got what done???
There will be no Firearms ban ..
There will be alot of "feel good" legislation like possibly  addressing  Bumps stocks ,sge requirements etc. but those things will have little effect ..But the AR15 will not be banned,simply because that's not the problem
7967 2018-02-23 12:38:07 @PostMalone marry me plz
7968 2018-02-23 12:37:57 Oh, go and polish your bump stocks. It's Friday and I'm writing 2,000 words about how the Parkland survivors are going to change the fucking world.
7969 2018-02-23 12:37:53 Never said anything about getting rid of the second amendment. People shouldn't be able to purchase semi-automatic guns, or any adjustments to make a normal gun fire at the speed of an automatic gun. No bump stocks, no AR-15s
7970 2018-02-23 12:37:20 Btw, isn't Trump the one raising the age and banning assault rifles and bump stocks?

7972 2018-02-23 12:37:05 @GMA is trying to say Snapchat stocks fell cause Kylie tweeted about not liking the new update ( L O L ) ... yeah ok  the whole world isnt fucking with it
7973 2018-02-23 12:36:54 really?? did you get the information from the same people that told you that Hillary would win, also Trump is going against members of his own party and wants to out law bump stocks, but this bias rag would not give him credit for anything
7974 2018-02-23 12:36:35 Do the right thing good people: fight for a) reduction of magazines to a maximum of 15 rounds or less b) stop sales of bump stocks and other gadgets that turn guns into machine guns c) ban sale and resale on any level of assault weapons now d) require 10 day waiting period.

7978 2018-02-23 12:35:32 This would b a good start: Here's what could:
1. Require biometric guns so only owners can shoot them
2. Universal background checks.
3. No sale till check completed.
4. Ban hi-cap mags.
5. Checks for all purchases of more than 100 bullets.
6. Ban bump stocks.....

7986 2018-02-23 12:32:09 Raising the age to 21 is not the solution. Stop selling and outlaw high capacity assault weapons first. Bump stocks are useless unless you have a semiautomatic assault weapon.
7987 2018-02-23 12:31:05 Just ban all assault weapons, magazines with more than 5 bullets, bump stocks, suppressors. Ban American Taliban @NRA. Mandatory background check, 2 week wait time, mental screening, #GunSafety training, min age of 25 for gun buy. License/regulate existing guns. #GunReformNow.
7988 2018-02-23 12:30:25 And ban flesh light "hump stocks"

7990 2018-02-23 12:28:51 His family need to protect themselves. Maybe you can offer a discount on the AR15? But it’s only fair that the chipmunks have guns too. Now the rabbits & possums need them as well. Now their babies need armed guards... Wow! My gun stocks just went through the roof! Thanks, Dana!

7992 2018-02-23 12:28:32 Thanks I did know and any modification like that should be illegal as well. But I know you weren’t referring to bump stocks in your original tweet though lol
7993 2018-02-23 12:27:30 So was your little "photo stunt" with the survivors of the Florida shooting. NRA spent  $31 million dollars to make you president. I applaud you for banning bump stocks. Although, will see if you really step up in the coming days.
7994 2018-02-23 12:27:00 Gary, huge fan from NY, nothing will happen with gun laws. At best, Trump will either ban bump stocks (which I believe were not used here) or arm teachers, nothing else will happen and it’s only a matter of time before there’s another shooting
7995 2018-02-23 12:26:28 “School hardening.” So this is a term now? This is what we get? 

How are private-prison stocks doing? I mean, now that we’re effectively expanding the market they can address?
7996 2018-02-23 12:26:19 will be gigantic task doing this for stocks but at sector index level seems manageable. 
7997 2018-02-23 12:25:40 Infringement on your rights with universal background checks and perhaps banning Semi Automatics with bump stocks? Yeah. GFY. #Trumptards #FuckingMorons
7998 2018-02-23 12:25:29 I love your stuff dude - please keep it up! Also love the idea of #BHR so thanks for that too. Any thoughts on the positive correlation of stocks and #BTC? I am very perplexed that #BTC has none of the characteristics of a safe-haven asset… (yet)
7999 2018-02-23 12:24:59 Not that dramatic. He wants to ban bump stocks, which NRA already got behind, and arm educators.
8000 2018-02-23 12:24:40 At least he is putting difference making ideas on the table, such as bans on bump stocks, raising the legal age and better background checks.  Wish I could say the same for our Congress.
8001 2018-02-23 12:23:39 @SenSchumer He’s just said things on bump stocks and age to purchase. You know he won’t follow through.
8002 2018-02-23 12:22:52 Just ban all assault weapons, magazines with more than 5 bullets, bump stocks, suppressors. Ban American Taliban @NRA.

8012 2018-02-23 12:18:35 Bump stocks were approved for sale under the Obama administration. Now being reversed. Those new changes in age requirements for rifle sales and stricter background checks did not occur during the 8 yrs of the Obama administration.

8021 2018-02-23 12:13:04 And ending the sales of bump stocks is another assault on the Constitution.
8022 2018-02-23 12:12:59 .@DLoesch, so the media "loves" school shootings eh? You know who else does? The @NRA. After every school shooting gun sales skyrocket. The stocks of gun companies go up. And what's the NRA's answer? More guns! Of course!

8027 2018-02-23 12:08:19 Not very many of these killings are done with bump stocks, but I agree about background checks. I also agree with an assault weapons ban, which we had until 43 let it expire.
8028 2018-02-23 12:08:14 I feel like my interview went well but in reality it probably didn’t, not when I mentioned that Kylie Jenner’s tweet caused snapchat to lose $1 billion in stocks and shares overnight #powerofsocialmedia

8031 2018-02-23 12:06:30 Bump stocks ruin aim, which is also part of why the NRA isn't against a ban. So they will be banned, which is good news. The bad is you can 3D print the fucking things.

8041 2018-02-23 12:03:43 Madness? Right. Of course the only logical way to stop these shootings is obviously to ban bump stocks! Gun control is key. Just look 2 CHI!

8054 2018-02-23 11:56:58 6. Going back to fundamentals, point of QE was to lower long term yields and through discounting factors elevate stocks and produce wealth effect. Normal that reversal of policy causes higher yields and therefore throws future discounting into reverse.
8055 2018-02-23 11:56:52 There's nothing wrong or evil about guns or bump stocks.  It's not the tool that is the problem, it's the hearts and minds of those who would wield them that is the problem.  Murderers use lots of means to kill: rocks, knives, bombs, bare hands, vehicles, planes.
8056 2018-02-23 11:56:31 MS-13 uses AR-15 rifles, bump stocks, semi-auto hand guns & armor-piercing bullets. They'd be much less deadly if they couldn't get their hands on them. Jusy saying..

8062 2018-02-23 11:54:08 Bump stocks are more a novelty than an effective multiplier of lethality. While increasing rate of fire, accuracy is destroyed. I have no use for one & don't care if they're banned, but fear the slippery slope of gun control, which is never satisfied until total disarmament.

8069 2018-02-23 11:49:21 I get it. I do. Just wish it didn't have to come to that point. I mean I'm not proposing we change anything. I just don't see the big deal about bump stocks.

8094 2018-02-23 11:36:05 You’re right, history in the 1700s did say you should be able to add bump stocks to your weapons.
8095 2018-02-23 11:35:54 How and where do I buy your stocks. How?
8096 2018-02-23 11:35:52 It is borderline grotesque that anyone should be looking to “blame” someone for equity market “instability” at a time of such extraordinary overvaluation in stocks

8101 2018-02-23 11:34:37 I meant shame in ye olde tyme manner of being placed in stocks & having peasants throw rotten veggies at them. I like the eviction from life thing too.
8102 2018-02-23 11:34:27 I am all for comprehensive background checks.  Don’t really care about bump stocks but they don’t kill.
8103 2018-02-23 11:34:26 When a tweet can cost you $1.3 billion dollars or more in stocks/revenue/value that indicates the power of transference.
8104 2018-02-23 11:33:43 Raise the minimum age, require background checks, no DV/stalking/rape/harassment history, confiscate& ban some kinds of guns, register ammo, ban silencers, bump stocks, some magazines.
 Require locks, gun ownership license renewal every two years. 
Do it.Won't stop all problems.
8105 2018-02-23 11:33:02 Then stop wasting time on stupid gun laws and build it.  You're smarter than that Donald.  CRIMINALS DON'T FOLLOW LAWS, CRIMINALS WILL STILL buy the millions of bump stocks in circulation, they will still get guns, and they will still shoot up unprotected targets.
8106 2018-02-23 11:32:56 I am absolutely open to Gun reform.  They should get rid of bump stocks & enact background checks for all purchases, including private.  That said, I want the same level of scrutiny applied to the voting application process as well as immigration.
8107 2018-02-23 11:32:42 It's important to talk about your loosing #stocks as you do of your winners in #investing #ASX $iph bought at $5.10 avg. Still believe in it ill keeep holding. Or might even add at this level. Let me know when analyst put a $2 price target it ill be strongest buy signal

8111 2018-02-23 11:29:39 Feb.22 (Dow Jones) -- Little matters more to shareholders now than interpreting the message from the bond markets. After the scare at the start of the month that knocked 10% off U.S. stocks, there are indications of possible good news hidden in rising bond yields.
8112 2018-02-23 11:29:22 Bump stocks do not turn guns into automatic rifles and it requires more skill to accurately shoot a rifle with one on it. 18 year old can enter the military and carry more deadly rifles AND die for our Country but not ok to own here is the proposal? No! Focus on Mental Health!!
8113 2018-02-23 11:29:20 Well yeaa duh thats how politics works. The people vote. But im saying he clearly wasnt capable of getting people on his side even with a democratic controlled government at the time. Couldn't even do little things like say, remove bump stocks??
8114 2018-02-23 11:28:59 People: Tweeting your opinions won't change anything!

8119 2018-02-23 11:25:42 True!  The @NRA thrives off mass shootings, because gun manufacturers have rising stocks & increased gun sales after every mass shooting, which means more kickbacks from gun makers to the @NRA & the politicians they buy & sell to sell out our children.  #NRABloodMoney whores.
8120 2018-02-23 11:25:16 Bump stocks, extended magazines and a more intelligent weapons classification system to rule out weapons intended for large casualties or with high velocity rounds
8121 2018-02-23 11:24:56 But even banning bump stocks won't solve the issue. The issue at hand shouldn't be HOW are these kids and other people committing these crimes, it should be WHY. Take a gun away from someone with murder in their heart and they will still have murder in their heart. Everybody
8122 2018-02-23 11:24:28 Latest polling shows 83% of Americans support net neutrality.  

But much like the overwhelming support for universal background checks and outlawing of bump stocks, Republicans really don’t give a damn about what Americans want.

8124 2018-02-23 11:23:43 FUNDAMENTALLY STRONG COMPANY. POSTED STRONG NUMBERS. ALMOST ALL WELSPUN GROUP STOCKS DOING REASONABLY GOOD
8125 2018-02-23 11:23:28 All of us republicans know that there is gun violence...but the guns are bot the problem. It's mental health, a society that de-values life and glorifies murder and crime. I agree that bump stocks are pretty pointless, as their only function is to make a semi-auto mimic an auto.
8126 2018-02-23 11:23:14 But TAC's are not respected. So the communication is misleading. #ICES expect unwanted catches in the order of 30% for important stocks in 2018. On top of continued discards Council has decided on top-ups now allocated to fishermen not documenting catches according to CFP art15
8127 2018-02-23 11:21:36 You're assuming these are bump stocks gun grabbing the images of those weapons and Las Vegas did not have bump stocks on them and the sound that was being made by those weapons is not made with the bump stock the rate of rounds put out when up and down the weapons were fully auto
8128 2018-02-23 11:20:47 Your grand leader wants to ban bump stocks. Who are you going to worship now?

8131 2018-02-23 11:17:32 So this hogg thinks the NRA loves mass shootings because they love this horrible publicity, because now bump stocks are gonna become illegal. Does people not think before they talk thats crazy.

8134 2018-02-23 11:16:02 We need a new law to put as person such as this on a 72 hold for psyche exam. This happens all the time. Women get restraining orders on a man yet she ends up murdered anyway. It's frustrating for the cops & victims. Also ATF has no authority over gun accessories like bump stocks
8135 2018-02-23 11:15:56 Stop dancing around like a completely owned political lackey. We can make it more difficult to buy assault rifles, we can strengthen background checks, and we can ban bump stocks. America doesn’t have to be the worst country for gun violence but you have to change first.

8139 2018-02-23 11:13:57 Yeah they are but accessories like bump stocks to make them fully aren’t. Sure the Trump admin is trying to get rid of them. Proof? When? If they are, good.
8140 2018-02-23 11:13:54 On larger AUM turning over stocks becomes even more difficult so as portfolio size grows, his ability to generate returns lowers
8141 2018-02-23 11:13:43 Me too. SSotI, me too. I bet my last bloody $ that not a damn thing happens.Ban bump stocks? you can 3-d print bump stocks ffs.

8143 2018-02-23 11:13:05 A lot of NRA-backed politicians are also realizing 18 is a young age to buy a rifle! I think we’re gonna see some changes soon! Hopefully they’ll raise the legal age to buy a rifle to 21, and Trump is pushing forward with banning the sale of bump stocks
8144 2018-02-23 11:12:05 Gun companies love mass shootings. Every mass shooting their stocks go up.

 Is that even legal ? 

With that much influence she could rig markets to her own benefit and blame "influence"
8150 2018-02-23 11:09:50 Holding stocks for the long-term doesn't mean that you need to buy and forget.

You must monitor your stocks aggressively and hold them as long as the fundamentals are sound.
8151 2018-02-23 11:08:07 Correct.  There is no reason for anyone except the military and law enforcement to own assault weapons.  Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
8152 2018-02-23 11:07:21 Get rid of AR 15s & Bump Stocks. Why THE HELL are taser guns illegal in some states? Do you WANT DEATH? Legalize all taser weaponry for public use/protection. Continue to allow hand guns- shotguns and hunting riffles after a mental health exam.
8153 2018-02-23 11:07:14 Hmmm. What about buying and shorting stocks, options, bonds, loan sharks, cryptocurrency?
8154 2018-02-23 11:06:43 Is this true?? If so why wouldn’t they put more money into instant film? Bringing back their peel apart or putting some focus on their film stocks.....or at least show some interest/commitment to keeping it!

8156 2018-02-23 11:04:58 Really? Cause I thought AR-15's were legal in 48 states. And bump stocks in all 50! But now that you say we have safe gun control laws already, I feel MUCH better...

8160 2018-02-23 11:00:28 I stand with the Parkland students. America needs a ban on all semi-automatic weapons & any optional equipment(bump stocks). The Constitution will survive, so will thousands of kids! The lives of Americans are critically important; killing spree weapons are not! #Parkland
8161 2018-02-23 10:58:11 As a reader I would like you to acknowledge that Calvert’s position is a useless one since the ATF has already told this administration, as they told the last, that they cannot regulate bump stocks without new legislation. So Calvert is asking for the impossible and he knows it

8211 2018-02-23 10:08:32 I have absolutely no idea why you or anyone thinks bump stocks should be legal. You can't chant "blue lives matter" and then support an attachment to a gun that has potential to greatly endanger their lives. There's a reason automatic rifles are illegal. Not just school shootings

8213 2018-02-23 10:06:19 If you need a bump stock you ain't shooting right. Bump stocks are a cost to accuracy in my experience. I do much better with semi-auto.
8214 2018-02-23 10:04:57 God has gun stocks.
8215 2018-02-23 10:04:28 Facts? Bump stocks have been used in ONE shooting
8216 2018-02-23 10:03:59 Agree 100% . No Model can work Always . Models/Sectors / Stocks move through cycle of popularity ( over valuation ) and hate ( under valuation ) . Key to be nimble enough to capture opportunities and stay away from Risk
8217 2018-02-23 10:03:49 He “vowed” to change the age minimum for owning a gun and to ban bump stocks. The kids interviewed said it would be a start, but let’s see if he does it. They saw through the lip service.
8218 2018-02-23 10:03:07 You are mistaken. You have a right to own firearms. So stipulated. You do *not* have a right to accessories for said firearms. Such includes bump stocks, full auto conversion hardware, etc.  Oh, btw, rights carry  responsibilities. Did you not have Civics 101 in middle school?
8219 2018-02-23 10:02:49 Good volume throughout the day. In stocks as well as in NF/BNF.

8222 2018-02-23 09:59:52 It makes it easier to murder a lot of people at once, that’s all that matters. 2nd amendment doesn’t say shit about bump stocks.
8223 2018-02-23 09:59:46 I don’t know, but I do know this—Texas is missing out on huge financial potential by not legalizing weed.  I’d love to get in on some IPO stocks, myself.
8224 2018-02-23 09:59:40 With or without bump stocks you can still get hold of semi-automatic assault rifles and they are a lethal weapon, 10 shots can still be fired in about 5-6 seconds! Deadly!
8225 2018-02-23 09:59:14 Yesterday many was tweeted for stay away from market and today many stocks give good closing. For best return stick with good fundamental stocks.
8226 2018-02-23 09:58:33 Many missed the oppurtunity to buy stocks at low prices which this week provided. However, start of next week will still be a good time to buy.

8238 2018-02-23 09:50:23 President Trump, why ban bump stocks?  Was this type of add on to the AR-15 involved in the school shooting in Florida?  Do not fall for the liberal's trying to usurp the Second Amendment.  You will lose much support if you do.

8255 2018-02-23 09:36:18 While investing we don't know anything in advance. It's all about investor's conviction. Most of today's blue chip had market cap much less than today's SME stocks.

8257 2018-02-23 09:33:52 The IGC raised the potential for a further drop in world grain stocks in 2018-19 too, restating a forecast from last month that wheat inventories will drop over next season, and proposing that corn stocks may fall too.

8259 2018-02-23 09:32:56 Someone said holding it like that allows for more rounds to be shots per minute. Something about never having to keep pulling trigger, it keeps going. The bump stocks? Because they won't do anything about them.Dems tried.

8263 2018-02-23 09:26:38 With his new shift on gun policies, wanting to ban bump stocks, raise age requirement from 18 to 21, and press for much more thorough background checks. I believe its because he is determined to lower mass shootings, and are open for options such as video games being a factor too

8279 2018-02-23 09:15:19 The Georgian thrown out of Russia is an American not Russian probably CIA and Putin knows it more bull shot propaganda developed from cia idiots. Cold War was over 1980 fools trying 2 pump military stocks w no reason. 13 guys free speech who cares.
8280 2018-02-23 09:15:05 I agree that we need to have a better mental health program... but you can't tell me that making bump stocks, automatic weapons, semi-automatic weapons illegal isn't going to help.
8281 2018-02-23 09:14:21 You know it’s very easy to get the same effect using just your hand? Bump stocks are as over exaggerated as silencers

8292 2018-02-23 09:05:24 Where is the Trump quote saying he approved a ban on bump stocks? I only saw a memo about reviewing the law. Far cry from a ban. I don't support a ban bcuz criminals will still use them. That leaves the public at risk.
8293 2018-02-23 09:03:34 Of course they do as they have destroyed all the fishing grounds close to China through over fishing. They are plundering the fishing stocks of every developing nation on earth by offering Chinese Money and resources

8302 2018-02-23 08:53:52 Finally, president Trump proposes something rational. Bump stocks are such a dangerous thing and yet they are still somehow legal.
Now about that emphasis on mental health...

8324 2018-02-23 08:35:32 You can do the same thing with a belt loop as a bump stock. But it looks like bump stocks will be outlawed so what's the problem?
8325 2018-02-23 08:35:10 Sometimes when we have a little extra cash & want to have some fun, we go find short term excitement. We look for hooker-stocks like these two (actually there are more).

Touch & go. Nothing sentimental. No long term relationship 
8326 2018-02-23 08:34:43 Although I do not super bump stocks.  They are imho a bastardization.
8327 2018-02-23 08:34:22 So, Rubio supports not allowing 18 year olds to have guns. That'll stunt the army some I guess. The need is moreso to gun-limit. Ban semi-automatic rifles and pistols of all kinds, bump-stocks, and high capacity magazines. #GunControl
8328 2018-02-23 08:33:37 Same here fam, they should really have more stocks though

8329 2018-02-23 08:33:22 When I heard that Trump comment on banning bump-stocks, I thought it was a good thing. It is, but it was produced by an official, so that Trump could take credit for a process continuing - nothing new, nothing different.
8330 2018-02-23 08:31:01 I'd be happy if they spoke up to ban bump stocks. I made no mention of that at all. You did. I don't know where you get this delusion about Soros funding. It's such a tired saw. I WOULD be interested in hearing your solutions, though. You must admit some get guns who shouldn't.

8333 2018-02-23 08:29:08 There is NOTHING safe or positive about arming teachers or school workers. The only reasonable solution is keeping guns out of the hands or minors and taking assault weapons, bump stocks & expanded magazines off of our streets.

8352 2018-02-23 08:16:07 Exactly right; NRA feigns engagement in whichever current debate will stall/divert/distract our focus from the discussion they most fear: fewer guns. “Moving the goalposts” is exactly what they do. They think we forget bump stocks were theoretically conceded by NRA, post-Vegas 
8353 2018-02-23 08:15:48 You want to ban bump stocks? What school shooting ever used bump stocks? The Vegas shooter had them.. he also had guns without them. How many were victuals from them?who knows? If they had been banned, would that have prevented this? No
8354 2018-02-23 08:15:38 Trump’s banning bump stocks and the republicans are introducing tough background checks. Hopefully people like you, who cannot debate this sensibly but just want to shoot stuff, will have your guns taken away.

8360 2018-02-23 08:12:11 You can talk about fraud in stock markets, but with the control most stocks give the owner and the flash trading, margin trading and algorithms controlling prices the fact is stock markets are a fraud.

8367 2018-02-23 08:08:41 Mr. President is not eliminating  bump stocks, or making more harder anything, because this is for the good people these restrictions, not for the bad people, they don't need background checks to get their illegal stuff, the solution is more police presence in our schools.

8394 2018-02-23 07:53:55 Yeah, and weapons stocks & sales records are their bible. There is no arguing logic with these people. They don't have enough humanity to care whether others live or die. NRA needs to lose their power & those they bought punted out of office.
8395 2018-02-23 07:51:58 Despite what the NRA will have you believe, our aim is not take all guns away. Not possible. We're seeking sensible regulations. You can protect your home without assault rifles, extended magazines, bump stocks, silencers on sniper rifles, and private sale loopholes.

8415 2018-02-23 07:42:47 Banning bump stocks would be a good start. Their only purpose is to circumvent an existing law. And as a gun accessory (not a gun) they don't fall under 2nd Amendment. A *Bipartisan* bill to ban bump stocks was recently introduced, and the NRA & gun lobby shut it down. Google it.

8445 2018-02-23 07:26:34 Bump stocks is a non issue. Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. Its like proposing stopping the sale of parts to make a motor vehicle because a drunk driver killed someone with a motor vehicle. I support you but I strongly disagree on this issue.

8448 2018-02-23 07:23:52 Bump stocks are done!  No need to reconsider. I am pro-gun-advocate,but assault weapons aren’t needed in the household.   .
8449 2018-02-23 07:23:30 When 2nd anendment was written it was for Gathering a militia who used single shot muskets to fight the British. The NRA has turned that into it's okay to use AK 15s and bump stocks.

8456 2018-02-23 07:20:23 It's sad but there's no useful common ground to be found. The least thing would be to ban assault weapons. It's not that far afield; we've done it before. As long as that's off the table where are we supposed to start? Bump stocks? Really? Offer real compromise if you mean it.

8463 2018-02-23 07:17:51 I think he means people with schizophrenia and psychopathic tendencies, not someone with a little depression. And who cares about bump stocks? They're a cheap gimmick.

8468 2018-02-23 07:15:14 Ok yeah wtf THEY GROW ON STOCKS??
8469 2018-02-23 07:13:05 Kylie Jenner basically said Snapchat sucks, their stocks dropped, but still no update to the original format??
8470 2018-02-23 07:12:54 It shouldn’t be.
It’s a sign of everyone just following the pointed finger of NRA and Trump.
They decided to make sure the conversation was framed around more guns not banning guns.
Like they did wit bump stocks.
Step 1 reframe.
Step 2 move on with no action taken.
8471 2018-02-23 07:12:09 People are afraid. They argue about AR15's and stocks and idiotic 'gun control laws' (you recall that laws arent followed by criminals)  like these are the problems.  What wrong with at least a year of military service?  everyone yaps about 'serving' their country, carry on...
8472 2018-02-23 07:12:01 Who gives a shit about money or stocks, to me stocks are a higher form of gambling. No wonder America can not be United it's indwelt with sin that is approved by man not to be sin. Like tobacco use. And alcohol. And guns. Gun's are sin.
8473 2018-02-23 07:11:29 That’s the problem. My pictures are so rare that you have to go through my archives in order to find a decent one. I believe @StillMyThrone has some too. I used to manage all her food stocks when we were traveling together.
8474 2018-02-23 07:09:27 And only ban automatic guns and guns with bump stocks

nak paksa paksa apa.... stocks pun aku da x ckup tangan ke sana sini... 

then override RHB tu berapa sgt....
8478 2018-02-23 07:08:23 Side note, outlawing bump stocks is also pointless, as you can achieve the exact same thing with a rubber band on any firearm.
8479 2018-02-23 07:07:11 Because if you had stocks in a company and you had them on vanguard, fidelity, and etrade, and then sold the ones on vanguard, they wouldn’t look at your holdings on fidelity.
8480 2018-02-23 07:07:07 Bump stocks are dangerous- accuracy is limited, increasing the radius of fire + random loss of life. Also not a good design. In any case I'm told you can make one in your garage out of PVC pipe in 15 minutes. Probably wasn't good of the press to have ever mentioned they exist.

8483 2018-02-23 07:06:04 What does bump stocks have to do with anything regarding a school shooting that is being portrayed by the media to induce more gun restrictions that will do absolutely nothing
8484 2018-02-23 07:05:51 Actually they’re not already enforced. Far from it. We don’t have a ban on assault weapons or bump stocks. We don’t require mental health screening before one buys a gun. Where do you see that we enforce that?

8488 2018-02-23 07:03:49 Maybe insider trading if she now buys Snapchat stocks and starts tweeting about how great it is?? I have no idea.
8489 2018-02-23 07:03:13 He isn't getting rid of bump stocks, in fact what he wants is to arm teachers with hand guns. Trained police have a %37 accuracy rate.

8494 2018-02-23 07:00:17 Let him do what? Stronger BG checks? Might be hard to accomplish, given he's cutting their budget by $millions... The only tangible thing he's proposing, is something the NRA said they'd be willing to give up, a long time ago. Bump stocks. Everything else, takes $$ we do not have
8495 2018-02-23 07:00:15  This morning at Ebbsfleet, it's Free fruit for your commute day from 07:30! Whilst stocks last. Be sure to pick up your fruit!
8496 2018-02-23 07:00:12 yes sir, but we aren't gonna be the ones crying in the end.  Your gonna accomplish two things.  No more bump stocks, to which who cares?  Age 21, to which who cares?  and that's about it, and you know what. Who cares?
8497 2018-02-23 06:59:51 If we assume we can't ban all assault rifles, we'll be stuck arguing about meaningless "reforms" about age limits, butt stocks, armed teachers. If we don't take the NRA head on, we're stuck playing their game and promoting their frames.
8498 2018-02-23 06:59:18 He’s gaslighting people of course. The right thing, ban assault weapons AR-15 etc.. ban bump-stocks or whatever they are calling. No guns for abusive  people and strict background checks and maintenance checks.
8499 2018-02-23 06:58:25 Electrode prices in 2018 to be more than triple of 2017 . People still selling out their stocks 
8500 2018-02-23 06:56:27 Hope they catch them ,I'd put them in stocks and leave them there ,SCUM
8501 2018-02-23 06:55:05 10 year, 2.93 stocks don't care yet
8502 2018-02-23 06:54:52 No. Assault rifles posses 2 of the following:

Folding stock 
Pistol grip
Threaded barrel for suppressor 

And oddly...grenade launcher or bayonet mount?

The last two always confused me.

But I'm pretty sure the Ruger mini 14 would qualify too, I've seen folding stocks for it
8503 2018-02-23 06:54:50 And doing a hell of a job pissing off Australia! I am sorry but, stricter background checks, and banning bump stocks, will not make a difference. Just like they said, it's like putting out a forest fire with a garden hose. Oh, and changing the age, to buy a gun, is so stupid!
8504 2018-02-23 06:54:49 They’re like 3 years too late. Whoever bought Pandora stocks in the last year definitely knew what they were getting into.

8507 2018-02-23 06:53:24 @realDonaldTrump Along with eliminating high capacity magazines, eliminate all assault rifles also.  Increasing the age limit and eliminating bump stocks is not enough. We WILL continue to see these massacres of many children if we don't get rid of the two things I propose.
8508 2018-02-23 06:53:09 Banning AR-15s alone is not enough. We should target all rifles with significant rates of fire, detachable magazines, semi-automatic firing modes, collapseable/foldable stocks, etc. aka #BanAssaultWeapons
8509 2018-02-23 06:52:58 Maybe actually try taking the stocks off instead of hoping I SD
8510 2018-02-23 06:52:26 My prediction about banking stocks of last year wasn't inaccurate.Many traders made no profit on them.

8513 2018-02-23 06:52:10 The stocks are an indicator of the search trends, not the other way around. If the stocks goes up, it gets media attention.
8514 2018-02-23 06:51:50 Those kids, my kids will soon be voting. Ignore the NRA. Don't settle for crumbs. Ban assault weapons. Ban large magazines. Ban bump-stocks. ALLOW the CDC to investigate gun violence!! No-exception background checks. Raise age to 21. Register and license guns like we do cars!!
-
8515 2018-02-23 06:51:45 Strengthening background checks and getting all agencies communicating would be great because law abiding citizens can still have their guns. Banning bump stocks does nothing for stopping any kind of shooting
8516 2018-02-23 06:50:50 I don’t care either way about bump stocks. I’m for mental heath background checks (depending on how it’s implemented.) The age thing gives me pause. I joined the Army when I was 17. They obviously thought it was okay for me to have a gun then.
8517 2018-02-23 06:50:35 Keep the handguns. No extended magazines. Keep your shotguns. No rifles. No bump stocks. No ability to modify any weapon.
The 2nd amendment referred to muskets. It's time to amend it to reflect modern times. Having common sense in your legislation isn't a bad thing.

8520 2018-02-23 06:49:42 I hope lawmakers take action on gun safety. I support raising age limit to 21 and I also support a ban on bump stocks.
8521 2018-02-23 06:49:23 Gun law has a proper place and use. Any increase in this area should be designed to rectify the event raising the issue. For instance bump stocks were not used by Cruz and banning bump stocks does nothing to stop the use of binary triggers.
8522 2018-02-23 06:49:20 Totally agree, in fact only banning bump stocks are an insult. It’s a multiple system failure and needs a multiple system solution
8523 2018-02-23 06:49:04 Spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ is what is needed. I am for the 2nd amendment but we do not need bump stocks. We also should not be aborting babies.

8538 2018-02-23 06:37:58 Bump stocks are so useless. They mimic automatic but in reality are a terrible shot/aim. Let's do something to protect our schools NOW like allowing teachers to conceal carry if they're licensed and choose to. Banning crap isn't going to make them safer, long or short term.
8539 2018-02-23 06:37:54 Yes, there are tons of ways to bumpfire a gun, without the stock accessory. If it does get banned it will solve nothing because bumpfire stocks 99.99% of the time, factually speaking, are not being used in mass shootings, neither is the technique itself.

8548 2018-02-23 06:33:25 @realDonaldTrump I agree with arming people in school, but making bump stocks illegal is contradictory to our Constitution, that you swore to defend!

8554 2018-02-23 06:30:45 Why do all these 2nd amendment lovers think that we want to take away their guns? I'm a gun owner but want stricter rules and regulations. I certainly don't think people should be able to buy AR-15'S or the need for both stocks. Our world is different than our forefathers!
