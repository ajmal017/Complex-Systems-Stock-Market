1 2018-05-03 23:59:46 Olbas oil ftw.
2 2018-05-03 23:59:35 "Not how much oil fuel you burn it's about how much money you save on the finance"  Nice planet killing motoring advice from @radiolivenz  
Boycott planet killing business models please.
3 2018-05-03 23:59:11 Me and my crappy eyesight first took that to read as “please send coconut oil sex.”
I’d like both please.
4 2018-05-03 23:58:55 I put Aloe Vera on my face everyday, along with coconut oil and witch hazel.
5 2018-05-03 23:58:50 Instead of studying for my final I:

-washed clothes
-got an oil change

9 2018-05-03 23:58:31 Yum. I love California olive oil.
10 2018-05-03 23:58:12 Yesss! I’m gonna blog about it very soon. I bought my castor oil on amazon, but I know Walmart has it for $2. Apply it before bed every night and you see results as soon as a week!
11 2018-05-03 23:57:46 All the revision in the world cannot save a bad first draft. Tesla was built for $150 oil the fact it survived this long is truly amazing. I think they go bankrupt but to be very clear CNBC coverage was not realistic as the shares traded from $180 to $480 last year. #elonmusk
12 2018-05-03 23:57:31 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
13 2018-05-03 23:57:27 @RitaSofiale you have so much olive oil in you  that your heart tastes like lasagna
14 2018-05-03 23:57:26 How? When the oil prices have gone down, subsidy would have gone down or eliminated..BJP lecturing us when Diesel and petrol prices were up.
15 2018-05-03 23:57:23 So she’s a hunter then? Doesn’t sound like you’re as different as you think. *I said and put the chicken in the hot oil* That’s actually a good thing. You don’t have to lie. Unless it’s about me, Dean and the kids.
16 2018-05-03 23:57:13 As you said, in seeds like hemp the amount of ALA needed to convert to DHA and EPA is inadequate, but in hemp at least the amount of Omega-6 relative to Omega-3 is very low. Does this make olive oil safer than hemp oil? After all there is still a lot of Omega-6 in olive oil.
17 2018-05-03 23:56:58 You stated that doing things for US oil billionaires is bad. I am only pointing out that "your side" is indeed doing things for US oil billionaires. Not ascribing moral judgement. You did that yourself.

38 2018-05-03 23:56:55 History teaches us no matter what we do it is wrong. Gas/oil will always flow or can be obtained

40 2018-05-03 23:56:46 AND... Wash your t-shirt in an enzyme-based liquid detergent after the 'marinating'. Use cold water to wash and absolutely do NOT dry, until oil is gone (it will set once dried)  #urwelcome

42 2018-05-03 23:56:34 So the wealthy got a nice tax cut and the not so wealthy a small temporary tax cut. Then gas goes up at present about 30 cents a gallon in a few months so the wealthy oil companies get our tax cut too. What the ....!!

45 2018-05-03 23:56:19 America is not a socialist country in that way- the government of Venezuela owns the oil comp. which the primary source income of the country- the leaders are kleptocratic & corrupt-but Trump is moving in that same direction in being corrupt family owned kleptocracy-

47 2018-05-03 23:55:36 So how was work?
48 2018-05-03 23:55:24 Just what I thought. Crickets. It's like buying a car without an oil filter that you must purchase separately.
49 2018-05-03 23:55:06 I get that but why isn’t America invading venezuela they have massive oil reserves a sub standard army and they could think of loads of reasons to do so I’m not saying your wrong but America fucking hate Iran I’m not sure why

54 2018-05-03 23:53:50 Bruh I’ve been looking for my headphones and my tea tree oil for a week. And I can’t find that shit no where
55 2018-05-03 23:53:43 Dear @TheGoodGodAbove , I don’t ask for a lot. But it seems like a lot of your followers are buying into this orange faced snake oil salesman’s garbage. Since they think the news is fake can you give them a more obvious sign? I mean, it’s gonna have to be really fucking obvious..
56 2018-05-03 23:53:19 Rob, you've swallowed a line of total bullshit spewed out by oil companies & hedge-fund capitalists.

As for the hole in the Ozone layer, it's got smaller because CFC's were banned in the 80's. You know, the world took action.
57 2018-05-03 23:53:06 Oil and coal deposits... yes, they came from organic material. Does that prove a global flood? No.
58 2018-05-03 23:52:44 Bio Oil, la encuentras en farmacias homeopáticas 
59 2018-05-03 23:52:37 so sorry to hear that! Make sure you use some CBD oil to control that anxiety

63 2018-05-03 23:52:13 Do you reveal that all this pro-Trump bullshit you've been Tweeting is actually a massive practical joke and that of course you can really see that he is an intellectually deficient snake oil salesman? 
64 2018-05-03 23:52:01 Wouldn't a bottle of castor oil have been more appropriate?

You oppose oil.

76 2018-05-03 23:51:00 No I think they are sorry they ever got into it in the first place, besides the world has altered since, shale oil and gas, the US is now a net energy exporter and of course the big Dragon emerging in the East and an aggressive Russia. 
The US is playing a holding pattern
77 2018-05-03 23:50:11 I once went for pizza with a friend. She ordered "hot oil' pizza, as I remember, a white pie with spicy olive oil under the cheese. The oil rises above the cheese. She blotted it off.
78 2018-05-03 23:50:03 when it comes to tea tree oil, my choice goes to thursday plantation.
79 2018-05-03 23:49:49 So anyone know about oil changes HAHAHA
80 2018-05-03 23:49:39 I know a guy who made his money from fuel subsidy fraud. He had staff he was paying well at his oil servicing company. When the fraud was stopped, the staff had to be relieved of their jobs. Would you blame the government for that?? Would fraud be allowed to continue?
81 2018-05-03 23:49:39 The us has invaded the Middle East many times, stolen oil and attempt to occupy their land, hmmm@m I wonder why they’re mad

85 2018-05-03 23:48:52 That's next on list.  TENS works on shoulder but not knee.  Cannabis oil doesn't do much.  For now they've got me back on light opioids and 3 arthritis meds.  After second knee I may see about Kratom.
86 2018-05-03 23:48:36 Offshore Technology Conference attendance fell 5.2% to 61,300 this year from 64,700 in 2017, according to the sponsor. Oil prices have only recently started to rebound, and US gas prices remain cheap.
87 2018-05-03 23:48:34 On vacation in a very remote area in New Mexico with limited internet (including my mobile hotspot)—my wife’s wishes come true. Limited to no tweets for awhile, therefore. Enjoy the break! #oott #fintwit #oil #WTI #CrudeOil #OPEC

90 2018-05-03 23:48:22 found a piece of molded bread under a pile of clothes ... breakfast is served! nah, kidding. raisins and fish oil for breakfast. (◦˙▽˙◦)
91 2018-05-03 23:48:05 In 1940, bacon drippings were cooking fat. Or you could be weird and use the oil intended for salads.
92 2018-05-03 23:48:00 It’s chicken strips, thank you. And yes, there is a difference. *I said and grabbed the oil* So, are we going to talk about this lady?
93 2018-05-03 23:47:40 sure, i'll give you /landscape painters some time... How much time do you need to come up with a better model? 
tbh the oil painting is a bit easy target since the canvas texture resembles the pixels in the AI generated images... i think watercolor could be more challenging...

体験談であれば、その受けた体験(良くも悪くも)を素直に書けば良いのではって思います。
個人によって意見が違うのは当然なので、自分のブログだけでなく他のブログの体験談も見比べた上で、そのお店に興味をひかれるか判断して頂ければ良いかなと思います。

98 2018-05-03 23:47:00 and allow the offshore oil.gas exploration to destroy the fishing areas...how about worrying about healthcare,doctors,education as all are disasters..we need doctors bad and people are graduating illiterate. Pre-school is a waste of time and taxpayers dollars..1/2
99 2018-05-03 23:47:00 came to get an oil change and they're pissed bcs the close in 15 minutes but uhhh, if youre open till 7 dont close til 7
100 2018-05-03 23:46:30 random pro tip: if your hair is ever super dry and moisturizers won't help, try a bentonite clay mask with a little aloe and tea tree oil if you have it 
101 2018-05-03 23:46:24 Myrrh is an embalming oil which symbolized death. The wise men by bringing myrrh as one of the three gifts was foreshadowing the gruesome death Christ would face and even more difficult the burdens of a sinful world would rest on His shoulders.    1/2
102 2018-05-03 23:45:57 I have a pet theory about focus. Tory focus is on the individual - what's best for me. Labour's focus is on the party - can I get my friend elected. SNP focus is on Scotland - can we keep the NHS. Green focus is on the planet - leave the oil under the sea. Wider and wider scope.

104 2018-05-03 23:45:39 Check your Engine oil this morning.
105 2018-05-03 23:45:04 Yup. First it was just a pay raise they wanted, when they got twice what they asked for they then tacked on more yearly funding. The quickest fix is tax raises. True, the oil industry here enjoys a lot of tax breaks and can afford it but still.
106 2018-05-03 23:44:45 I'm not happy, most of the fans are not happy. The trade's today confirmed that Steve Hamilton will be back, best bet Will Warm will be the next traded. Oil Kings have become the new Lethbridge of 5yrs ago

109 2018-05-03 23:44:20 I couldn’t give a f**k about America; it’s all rampant capitalism & con-artist billionaires, war industry & oil, murdering innocents as “collateral damage”, privatising the planet’s resources; give it back to the natives and we’d be far better off
110 2018-05-03 23:43:56 The plan for 911 was hatched in the brain of George Bush Sr and then   inserted into the brain of his very close friend the king of Saudi  Arabia...for the ultimate  control of oil ...IMHO.

119 2018-05-03 23:42:45 I wish j knew someone that could show me how to grow a chemist especially how to make the oil like a  ape cartridge would save me a lot of money
120 2018-05-03 23:42:44 Sebenernya cuma 2 oil sih, cuma aku ngestock aja biar ga beli2 mulu. Jadi tiap problem ntar beda2 gitu campuran oilnya, tergantung saran adminnya
121 2018-05-03 23:42:37 Poor chick. Soak a cloth in white vinegar and place on burn for about 5 minutes. Then rub honey or lavender oil over burn.

Feel better!
122 2018-05-03 23:42:33 You realize you’re telling me this in a thread that exists b/c Big Oil is engaging in a disinfo/smear campaign, right? Of course not, you already ignored that point when I made it the first time. 
Our OVERuse of oil is killing the planet.  This is the salient fact you ignore.
123 2018-05-03 23:42:27 No thanks! The oil will suffice! Eww 
124 2018-05-03 23:42:17 If you find out, don’t tell me.
125 2018-05-03 23:42:14 I accidentally poured hot oil on my foot and I regret
126 2018-05-03 23:41:46 Fun fact: At my first job, someone dumped a whole bottle of essential oil into the floor air duct to 'freshen the place up'. Multiple employees had to go home.

Thankfully, their ass got fired.
127 2018-05-03 23:41:38 No, you don't. It's beneath disgust.
128 2018-05-03 23:41:28 Is Big Mood like Big Oil or Big Pharma?
129 2018-05-03 23:41:22 Flames ont les Hitmens, Oilers ont les Oil Kings dans la WHL.
130 2018-05-03 23:41:12 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump why is gas so expensive if we are making so much oil ?
131 2018-05-03 23:41:08 The best thing to do would be to cut up this corporation like standard oil and ma bell. Everybody loses with the status quo here, sorry to break it to you. These corporate campuses don't create livable cities just eerie HVAC Soundscapes
132 2018-05-03 23:41:07 Proper olive oil, butter & beef/lamb/duck fat
There was some new research into oils eg sunflower, rapeseed etc and arthritis.
133 2018-05-03 23:41:01 I spilled body oil all over my sheets that I just put on my bed, fuck
134 2018-05-03 23:40:54 Their socialist leaders made all oil government property or whatever, and they made like 90% of their economy be pretty much just oil, so when oil prices dropped, their economy went to shit. Also they sold things at a price lower than the price to import it into the country.
135 2018-05-03 23:40:48 so Royal Jelly has been great to me for 1st week. now time to see what this MCT oil is all about

142 2018-05-03 23:40:13 even they have courts and schools and soldiers and profits from oil drilling and on and on. socialism works when its managed by smart people to the benefit of all. Some capitalism is fine but too much spells disaster for a society
143 2018-05-03 23:40:02 Ngl you probably right but it’s been a long grind with the castor oil and mans just getting there ygm
144 2018-05-03 23:39:50 Took my car for a simple oil change and tire rotation at @jiffylube - they broke one of my lugs and are now telling me I’ll likely have to spend thousands of dollars to get them all replaced.
145 2018-05-03 23:39:46 If the oil over the ankle situation with Steph is true, haha I’m glad we skipped on MJ. Ewing would be nice but he did just sign with GT. Oak... no chance
146 2018-05-03 23:39:43 he smells like ketchup and sweat and engine oil
147 2018-05-03 23:39:41 I only use coconut oil on my hair and to do my hair I use moose and hair spray and I dry it once I apply it!!!

151 2018-05-03 23:39:29 #MothersDay is gonna be costly, she wants something in a 7.62 now! Its shiny with oil right? 
152 2018-05-03 23:39:26 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
153 2018-05-03 23:39:15 aka something similar to collateralize debt obligations but also very different.  An oil spike can suddenly cause inflation in non oil industries, and this drove prices higher in non oil products.

Higher interest rates that caused a recession plus a renegotiating of these ...
154 2018-05-03 23:39:05 seasme oil has changed my life.
155 2018-05-03 23:38:59 Don't worry about it, you definitely don't need to know.

159 2018-05-03 23:38:44 For a country that produced fake fruits, gutter oil and plastic noodles, what an irony to check for rot for US fruits. Just slap an embargo on these commie bandits already. They can eat their color injected local produces.

163 2018-05-03 23:37:46 Who gave the original order to do 911?...sure the Saudi spooks did the deed, but who told them to and who financed it.  Who wanted the excuse for war to rule the Middle East oil?
164 2018-05-03 23:37:20 I posted today:

168 2018-05-03 23:36:55 In this space I have laughed & coughed, read books & papers, prayed & made love, burnt the midnight oil & painted crazy things, chatted & drunk whisky & wine & prosecco.
169 2018-05-03 23:36:50 No. Your eyes will roll so hard it will give you a headache.
170 2018-05-03 23:36:40 I was supposed to get my oil changed 902 miles ago. Wow.

177 2018-05-03 23:36:13 After work, I went to a supermarket & got oat bran & cupcakes, but the olive oil & paper towels were cheaper in another SM, so I went there too, but the deodorant & hair cream were cheaper in a department store, so I went there, but the shampoo is cheaper on the drugstore
178 2018-05-03 23:36:10 Somebody got u if u payin $80 for an oil change. I kno some some niggas that would have that done for a 6 pack of budlight and some skittles
179 2018-05-03 23:36:10 I just removed all of mine with oregano oil.
180 2018-05-03 23:36:03 Lol that's the one! Extra Virgin Oil cold pressed. Our beloved prophet ﷺ used that. BTW don't use olive oil to cook in  it's so bad when it's heated,  meant to be eaten uncooked. When olive is heated it becomes carcinogenic coconut oil better for cooking.
181 2018-05-03 23:35:56 One of two things are gonna happen when we run out gas and oil, A: Tesla is going to be making bank, or B: We are all going to be riding bikes.
182 2018-05-03 23:35:53 So it is forecasted that oil is going to dropped bigtime later this year. Expect to see Venezuela to get into even worst conditions if it does happen.
183 2018-05-03 23:35:43 Crude is about to tank, too many longs, they bought to make money, it isnt happening. Expect $40 oil soon
184 2018-05-03 23:35:39 No one warns you that when you buy a premium car that you’re looking at premium oil change prices too
185 2018-05-03 23:35:28 My father was a cement mason before he sold enough of his oil paintings. My mother was a school cook, then worked in a meat packing plant. I type words at at a box.

193 2018-05-03 23:34:29 Black ppl hair type is different than whites. Its coarse, thick and needs oil. It shouldnt be washed daily, that dries it out. Look at black hair. Make some place friends. Youll see
194 2018-05-03 23:34:28 I always forget that I can't do a oil treatment before I straighten my hair smh
195 2018-05-03 23:33:40 Jamaican castor oil works best sis, especially for your edges
196 2018-05-03 23:33:31 yeah it's a bit much??? My hair is as straight as paper; maybe curly hair like that can achieve that kid of molding with enough olive oil slathered into it?
197 2018-05-03 23:33:23 If you like your doctor...

198 2018-05-03 23:33:04 HIS car got hit, yet somehow everything was under my name so I drove the rental, he made me pay the 50 dollar deposit, then when I got his car back I filled up his tank, when I got my car back I had to pay for the oil change even though he was driving it?
199 2018-05-03 23:32:55 Don’t ever do takeout, it’s not the same. TRUST me. Also, make sure to taste the broth itself first just to appreciate it like that and then add what you want. You can add lime, hot sauce, hoisin sauce and chili oil.
200 2018-05-03 23:32:34 If there’s no oil at an Italian restaurant with my bread then I don’t wanna talk

202 2018-05-03 23:31:58 Rep. Fetgatter said he agrees economic development is about more than just tax credits. He said the state's war on oil and wind also negatively impact economic development.
203 2018-05-03 23:31:56 Tasted my Peanut Butter and Honey Hefeweizen today. It's..okay? As usual, peanut dominates and I couldn't get enough of the oil out.
204 2018-05-03 23:31:21 How come @BarackObama was so much better at keeping gas prices in check than @realDonaldTrump? In pocket of big oil too?
205 2018-05-03 23:31:07 The fact that he got rid of it.. now it could end up in hands that he has no control over and he could be directly responsible for buying a gun that kills someone.. if ur a responsible owner and u feel u don't need the gun put it away, don't use it, selling it, is an atf riddle..
206 2018-05-03 23:30:58 I never get any weird reactions from products but this Hemp oil drives my eyes craaazzyyy
207 2018-05-03 23:30:51 Oils pumps/gears for somthing I don't quite know. But it resembles oil pump gears in motorcycle engines. Omg. Motorcycles?
208 2018-05-03 23:30:49 Olive Oil is even better.

211 2018-05-03 23:30:35 You published an article in 2017 linking global warming, Rosnef, Putin, & other oil giants and how they stand to profit from global warming, thus their push to make their blind follower believe climate change is a hoax. I’m with you girl- keep it up. You are a patriot!

216 2018-05-03 23:30:00 If any could free them, it's you. I wish you could take control of the oil companies. Gas is again going sky high. The reason they do it is simply because they can.

221 2018-05-03 23:29:09 I hate nose bleeds, migraines and allergies. Love doing yard work, but yard work hate me. Need to have figners that the oil from the poison ivy washed off in time.
222 2018-05-03 23:29:04 Jojoba oil is supposed to be the closest in composition to our natural body oils, which is our skin’s “hydration”. Also, is it possible for you to get approved to use a less harsh soap?
223 2018-05-03 23:28:54 Oh my good holy f**k! You complain when we have an opinion & “interfere”, then agree with imposing your moron as a “leader” of us ? Are you for real ? USA (Bush) invaded Iraq because they didn’t want oil traded in euro; murdering innocents - THAT’S corrupt!

238 2018-05-03 23:25:00 Aesthetics over flavour? Cloudiness of olive oil at low temperatures doesn’t impact on the quality of the oil and therefore is the preferred option. The ‘Irishness’ of the rapeseed oil the Italian/Spanish/Greek olives are stored in is irrelevant #oliveoil #quality
239 2018-05-03 23:25:00 Neatsfoot oil softened up the leather on my baseball glove.
240 2018-05-03 23:24:48 Bought that wild growth oil and have no idea if the shit is working cause I have no plans of pressing my hair out anytime soon

243 2018-05-03 23:23:51 All the people that say twitter fans for the oil are negative are either new to the team or disconnected. If you truly are loyal and follow this team like a hardcore fan...IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO NOT BE NEGATIVE OR UPSET with the management of this team.

246 2018-05-03 23:23:34 It's hard to fault anything about #FullMetalJacket because it's just so well written and well made. It's absurd and funny but with this oil black undercurrent about the chaotic and violent underbelly to humanity, which leads to conflict on all scales and varieties. Similar to...
247 2018-05-03 23:23:24 Mixing $10 highlighter and grape seed oil together is looking like a good idea rn!
248 2018-05-03 23:23:12 But if you're from southern region, they might be said the same way. You know, as in "all" and "oil" !! :)
249 2018-05-03 23:22:59 Even kinder-morgan doesn't want to expand the pipeline. It is a con job looking for a sucker. Oil for export to Anacortes WA and California refineries.
250 2018-05-03 23:22:47 Screw you, hiccups! Die in a vat of boiling oil!!!!
251 2018-05-03 23:22:43 Yeah but PSG have oil money it’s like Man City. Whereas arsenal doesn’t it’s just a fact. Stop it. I promise you if arsenal could they would buy their way out of the abyss they’re in.

258 2018-05-03 23:21:39 Nah. 6 months to finally get some content? Scratch that. 6 months for 2 heroes and 1 map? Fuck that. Don’t defend the game. If you took your car to get an oil change and the windshield wiper fluid was free, but you had to leave your car there for 6 months, you’d be pissed.
259 2018-05-03 23:21:38 Oil and money. Oh and siding with Iraq in the gulf war. This is why the Saudis are committing genocide and the world sits by.

267 2018-05-03 23:20:41 Me too. I don't like being covered in oil. I let him know how much I appreciate him too. Appreciation goes a L-O-N-G way. 
Shhhh, don't let the lefties hear you. They'll be calling you "oppressed" .
268 2018-05-03 23:20:32 Already ordered some more from the lady that makes my beard oil. But good look on the tip!

Oddly it’s worse when I haven’t moved my hands for a while so the embroidery and writing by hand are very helpful.
286 2018-05-03 23:18:01 @ArendRox Arend,  best of luck to you. I respect a guy whose fiercely independent, gets right back up after they fall and is just a plain good guy who is on the tip of future. I see Pot becoming the new gold rush just like the internet oil of yesteryear.

288 2018-05-03 23:17:38 Provinces like BC & offshore oil resource extractors play this card all the time.  Refusing free flow of goods through the province, like coal, and oil resource extractors refuse to pay a federal tax or ON arbitrary intl carbon tax.Usually win at this game.  Maybe a PM from BC...

293 2018-05-03 23:17:06 I've never had that. I try to stay away from most dressings except a little olive oil or balsamic because I live a monk like existence.

The UCP love to vilify, and I dislike them for it.
313 2018-05-03 23:13:34 How about that tax cut?  More money in your paycheck. Kiss it goodbye. Gas prices up 50 to 75 cents a gallon. Think all those meetings with the Saudi was all just peace talks. Another con job by Trumpster to put more money in the big oil companies. Obama steadied prices

329 2018-05-03 23:10:58 Okay, excluding high oil prices what did the conservatives do for Alberta in the 44 years they ran the province.
330 2018-05-03 23:10:56 Is this...

Oil?

You wonder what happened in here. Where's your DAD?

No clean, safe way to generate electricity? Wow. Time to buckle down to recent reading, Bassam. Those are really old talkng points
337 2018-05-03 23:09:45 No. Don’t give them olive oil. They’ll just make salad and tapas and get comfortable.

360 2018-05-03 23:06:41 It was old. I did just a light rebuild; changed all the exterior o-rings, drained it, ran pump flushing fluid, and put new oil in.

367 2018-05-03 23:05:39 I didn't say there is a conspiracy.

Oil pollutes. 

Wind Turbines produce obscene noise pollution to their quiet rural communities, and an eye sore to the landscape. They are also a slaughter house for wild birds.

There is no safe clean way to generate power.
NatGas is cleaner.
368 2018-05-03 23:05:39 One of the beauty supply stores near is closing and everything is 30% off. So I took it upon myself to purchase 2 huge jars of olive oil ecoStyler for the low
369 2018-05-03 23:05:38 So you can afford to waste this much oil at a time but not pay me the $10 you still owe me?

383 2018-05-03 23:04:05 I'm short with a call spread with 2 weeks to expiration. Must be said that having the position on has at times been somewhat unnerving;  it's not often that Oil bids it's time to show it's hand.

are you saying increase my dosage or increase the carbon
387 2018-05-03 23:03:01 Fascinating. You think reduction in oil usage means reduction to zero. It’s not an all or nothing scenario.

397 2018-05-03 23:02:19 Not debating the NDP policy because it's terrible and irresponsible. However there will be market changes that should it come (and it's looking likely) that Oil will jump and almost double within months. That's going to make the NDP look good, or anyone else in power.
398 2018-05-03 23:02:12 the more I grow, the more I realize that all the stories that've been told to me about to world have been told from the outside perspective,

414 2018-05-03 22:59:32 ...or, just consume a plant-based whole foods (or minimally processed), low/no salt/oil/sugar diet...
415 2018-05-03 22:59:19 Well, dawg, here's the thing.  Rural BC is mostly just one big useless Alberta without oil and rurals get a *really* sweet deal on services vs. taxes.  So now that Kelowna isn't running Victoria, hold on to your dumb looking hats.
416 2018-05-03 22:59:11 What people do not understand is, in the West the melamine utensils and plates are used with food that are not laden with tamarind, oil, coconut, cooked tomatoes etc.  so they can use them without much consequences. Our cuisine leaches out harmful chemicals

425 2018-05-03 22:57:33 I don’t like zinke but Luke isn’t a good judge of character. He’d probably try to save zinke from evil oil influence and fail.

433 2018-05-03 22:56:16 My guys legit fried egg with engine oil back in Uni. And the amazing thing was that nobody was high or anything. Three people ate that egg before they realized what they did.

442 2018-05-03 22:54:32 Why the FuCk do we still depend on oil? There is an energy source that is essentially LIMITLESS just coasting through the sky every day. But no let’s have a bunch of ugly ass gunky ass stank ass refineries and rigs plopped about spewing greenhouse gasses that makes fucking sense

466 2018-05-03 22:50:06 One of the many things I find fascinating is that we have a tunnel that runs underneath the city and under Lucas Oil... it's a fascinating walk. I've made it a couple times. - @johngreen #WFYIListenUp
467 2018-05-03 22:49:59 It is the responsibility of government to keep snake oil salesmen from preying upon the desperate.
468 2018-05-03 22:49:56 RFUDCA.... cashews and mangoes are in the same botanical family as poison oak and poison ivy. Mango vines and uncooked cashews contain enough urushiol oil to cause similar rashes to ivy/oak exposure
469 2018-05-03 22:49:35 I made potatoes with olive oil and marinara sauce! I’m an extraordinary chef!
470 2018-05-03 22:49:32 Snake oil salesman Donnie just makes it up as he goes.
471 2018-05-03 22:49:17 Who is seriously suggesting we don't need gas and oil? Not the objectors, they'll be using it. The only question then is whether we frack for it ourselves, or import it more expensively from other Nations that have. Meanwhile 48,000 died in UK this year from cold related causes.

473 2018-05-03 22:49:10 Man I’m not using a lot of products on my hair like I did last time going natural. I’ll use my Miss Jessie’s but other than that, it’s my plain ole leave in conditioner and vitamin e oil.
474 2018-05-03 22:48:53 Problem is the Wisconsin refinery allegedly processes 50000 barrels of oil per day; the current Kinder Morgan pipeline along with its 12 tanks processes 300000 barrels per day. But KM wants to triple the capacity in North Burnaby with 14 new oil storage tanks
475 2018-05-03 22:48:53 The labor market and the oil market both follow the laws of supply and demand. If you're a big fan of OPEC limiting production in order to drive up prices, then maybe you are ok with UNIONS telling which individuals how many hours they can work. 

Seems like tyranny to me.
476 2018-05-03 22:48:36 Saudi Arabia has a strategy plan for the future that knows how handling with oil prices. Nothing be secretly with KSA.

478 2018-05-03 22:47:58 You realize Venezuela is under heavy US sanction right Charles?  Also their economy is very dependent on oil prices which until recently,  have been in the shitter.  If you want to play economist,  at least do some homework, you diaper-wearing stain.
479 2018-05-03 22:47:48 I just knew it wasn’t oil pastels, because they don’t really ever dry and would be a hot mess lol. I have a huge pastel piece I did in high school that will still smear if I were to drag my finger across it
480 2018-05-03 22:47:30 We made mistakes during the oil boom, Inflation soaring high. Which way is Great Nigeria heading to? ambitions to be millionaires affects many, which way Nigeria is heading to.? Let's stand together to reveal ourselves. Let's save our Father's land..
481 2018-05-03 22:47:20 Failure to develop young players is 50/50 on the players & coaches. Not many examples in last decade of oil turning any young players into useful team members

505 2018-05-03 22:43:58 2/ Ag policy aimed at farmer employment also maxes out fertilizer & other petrol products use, which oil industry pushes. Who has run an econ model to check macro-econ effects of majority of US popn eating a healthy diet? It could really reduce domestic at demand. ...

515 2018-05-03 22:42:58 lmao i feel that. i think i need to do more food offerings daily bc i have so much goddamn herbs and olive oil but i always do it like 3am so my brain isnt entirely working by then (i also have no good excuse)
516 2018-05-03 22:42:47 So it’s time to get my oil change and I’ve been postponing it for days now because my impatient ass doesn’t want to wait while it gets done
517 2018-05-03 22:42:46 Refine the tar in Alberta, Saskatchewan, in modern refineries, creating high paying long term jobs. Shipping dilbit is messy and dangerous. Transport finished product east. Stop all oil imports. Seems so common sense, what am I missing?
518 2018-05-03 22:42:46 of course we finally get recognition of #MMIW in the form of a day dedicated to it, and they put it on Cinco de Mayo 
and I'm pretty sure she doesn't know about the oil spill on the rez, or that  BP shut off the water supply to the Paiute

544 2018-05-03 22:40:05 Dear Sarah Huckabee,

Can you now admit that everything that was said at the #WHCD was actually factual? Considering the scrambling you ensued today after being dipped further in the hot oil by the "great" RJ. I would save face at this point.  Stop defending a liar.
545 2018-05-03 22:39:57 That is a really good reason and there might be oil in it.
Jorja.

550 2018-05-03 22:39:22 I live next to an oil refinery. It’s killing the people who live here. My spending can’t protect me but my representatives could.
551 2018-05-03 22:39:10 Australia is late to the space party, but that's not a bad thing. $50m? WHAT'LL THAT BUY 2 BOTTLE ROCKETS? HOW ABOUT SEED MONEY FOR OIL REFINERIES TO ENSURE OUR INDEPENDENCE? OR A CAR MAKER STARTUP?
552 2018-05-03 22:39:09 $20 hasnt filled up my car since about 2004. Was she driving a vespa? Stupid is as stupid does. Oil prices revolve around the oil stock reserves, futures trading, barrel production, and the market prediction.

561 2018-05-03 22:38:09 Sure Darcie. You have to understand that for all those solar panels and smart cars produced, you need oil. Oil is the fundamental fabric of society. Without which, we’d be walking around in animal skins and living in igloos.

567 2018-05-03 22:37:29 Then I would suggest cbd oil
568 2018-05-03 22:37:27 They taste good, I needed more binder I think instead of using the water/oil egg substitute I should have done the cornstarch/water one. Taste is most important though and they do taste good lol.
569 2018-05-03 22:37:23 Put smartbond, mythic oil, unique one and smoothing cream in my hair if it’s not tame in the morning I’ll shave it off

571 2018-05-03 22:37:09 Pls sincerely asking no diss what does this oil do?
572 2018-05-03 22:36:50 My dad bought my first car, showed how to change the oil before he gave me the keys. I’m a girl! Taught me how to drive. Took ways those keys when I came home late with little sister, too. 
573 2018-05-03 22:36:35 @deadskulltweets Love your beard! You should try this oil @CypressLaneCo
574 2018-05-03 22:36:19 I only know it from the Maldives, they built their Dhonies  (sailing boats) with it. They drench it with sharks oil....otherwise it does rott very fast.
575 2018-05-03 22:36:11 Did Obama control the price of oil?
576 2018-05-03 22:36:09 The robots are mostly used to check the rigs and pipelines to make sure everything is working properly. Eg. To spot an oil leak early. In the article we talk about how the robots made available footage of the deep horizon oil spill available to the public.
577 2018-05-03 22:35:47 Ok, y’all are really converting me to using oil with such perfect skin
578 2018-05-03 22:35:41 I think if we use oil with moderation. It’s overproduction that kills our planet. Like if you use avocado oil one day, hemp oil another day and so on. Maybe that’s the solution but honestly, this is difficult!
579 2018-05-03 22:35:25 Coconut oil.
580 2018-05-03 22:35:20 that oil tycoon joke heh

584 2018-05-03 22:35:02 IWCF is international well control forum, basically for oil and gas industry if u want to specialize as a completions or intervention engineer or subsea. IADC is for drilling specialization and more of hands on. They have fundamental and supervisory levels
585 2018-05-03 22:35:01 My favorite ICS (non-industry specific) conferences: S4, SANS ICS, ICSJWG, and CS3Sthlm. Awesome industry specific would be API (oil and gas) and GridSecCon (Electric). Each have different audiences and feels. But S4 and SANS ICS are my annual staples.
586 2018-05-03 22:34:59 Unions have power over wage prices in the same way that OPEC has power over oil prices. OPEC colludes with other producers to raise prices for producers. This is done by idling resources. Oil that would have been sold is left in the ground.
587 2018-05-03 22:34:48 Damm did the oil company add more water to their gas and charge more or wtf?
588 2018-05-03 22:34:28 I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Rise is trying to do a glee-version of Friday night lights, substituting steel town for oil.
589 2018-05-03 22:34:23 Which essential oil do you prescribe to counter that?

592 2018-05-03 22:33:44 When the bloody Lib Dems suddenly become the clear answer, that says all you need to know about how pathetic Labour are as an opposition.

600 2018-05-03 22:31:21 @TeamCavuto I listened to you today on Fox as you denigrated the President. Amazingly you NEVER took Obama to task for Obamacare, no oil pipeline, no Alaska exploration, a pure crappy economy for 8 yrs. I’m sure your deep state friends were pleased with you & your producer. SICK
601 2018-05-03 22:31:20 Chopped celery, cukes, tomato, & raddish. Dump a can of italian tuna in olive oil, and some chickpeas. Squeeze lemon and chopped parsley.
602 2018-05-03 22:31:01 Maybe, if trees weren't dying of bark beetle
Maybe, if we weren't heading into another drought year
Maybe, if we funded renewables instead of oil and coal
Maybe, if forests were managed instead of being clear cut

Lots of 'maybes'. I guess you don't care about any of them though.
603 2018-05-03 22:30:51 Without oil, yes! I’ve always wanted to use an air frier or bake them but in this context I just meant fast food!

621 2018-05-03 22:27:19 Today was a good practice run for summer. Meaning it was a good day for everyone to practice a) not looking at me, or b) ignoring the thick layer of sweat/oil forming all over my body the second I walked outside.

643 2018-05-03 22:22:34 Honestly, the biggest reason I haven’t taken a fish oil supp is the confusion around the best/right one. I don’t wanna drop too much  but do want quality. What do you recommend?

1. GEJ, although he sold crude oil for all time high btw 2010-2015, he did not add a dime to our foreign reserve.
2. GEJ met Reserve at $42B in 2010, then DEPLETED it to $28B in 2015
3. He also DEPLETED ECA by $2B

705 2018-05-03 22:10:54 kiss kiss kiss ...more fake news. Let's not talk about oil and gas mess in Canada or investors fleeing country.  Just love and kisses for Trudeau.  Vast majority of folks NO longer trust or believe left-wing media ...and for good reason.
706 2018-05-03 22:10:47 @QuinnBenjafield gonna miss seeing you on blazers.. I will make sure your hooked up with the cookies first game Oil Kings play blazers.

708 2018-05-03 22:10:45 Royalty revenues paid to oil exporting provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland “have declined 63 per cent between 2000 and 2015, from $11.1 billion to $4.1 billion.

716 2018-05-03 22:10:02 It's a complex web of money for sure but during and the Iraq war Haliburton, Cheney old Employer, received a disproportionate amount of Iraq oil contracts. The same with Johnson & Vietnam. I smell the stench of Eric Prince lurking somewhere around this now.
717 2018-05-03 22:10:01 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
718 2018-05-03 22:10:01 I’ll literally pay someone to go take my car to get a oil change I have no time.
719 2018-05-03 22:10:00 Tee tree oil and aloe vera should be up there with the main reasons to believe in God.
720 2018-05-03 22:09:33 olive oil can work too, ackshually your skin turns different colors based on whether you use coconut or olive, but real olive oil is hard to find; recommend coconut for other reasons too
721 2018-05-03 22:09:28 I expect something like Lucas Oil in Indy but bigger
722 2018-05-03 22:09:24 Wouldn't it be nice if a vacuumed kitchen lasted as long as an oil change?

724 2018-05-03 22:09:12 I literally cannot use makeup primers or my face will produce SO MUCH OIL!! Why God?
725 2018-05-03 22:08:49 olive trees will forever look like oil paintings to me after a trip I had in college
726 2018-05-03 22:08:45 Ha! I believe I saw that this is the beginning of the "organic olive oil" process! Guess what the goats are eating 
727 2018-05-03 22:08:17 When someone does nothing but bitch and complain you will never make that miserable person happy. Even if you meet all of their needs they will seek and find something else to bitch and complain about. So I quit trying now I'm taking care of myself now.

731 2018-05-03 22:07:06 Right around the shift to industrialization

Don’t need free labor if you have a machine that can do the job of 100 men with one operator and some oil/coal
732 2018-05-03 22:06:56 The stronger the economy the more demand for oil. Simple worldwide supply and demand.
733 2018-05-03 22:06:52 It's the no-knead bread from Mark Bittman. There are other versions online and from Cook's Illustrated. I've played around w/all of them. Girl V Dough has a good starter, and then I add a little vinegar and olive oil.
734 2018-05-03 22:06:51 Worse, they started demanding more than they originally asked for before the walkout occurred. To be fair, our state legislation loves their oil money and are loathe to part with it, but teachers pushed school back two weeks for stuff they changed their minds on.

740 2018-05-03 22:05:51 This fucker is a health guru and he’s chugging a bottle of avocado oil. What a weird diet
741 2018-05-03 22:05:45 Feels so good getting free oil changes, rotations and alignments bc of i work les shwab lol. I didn’t even pay for the oil 
742 2018-05-03 22:05:44 No...if the Oil had a farm system with numerous young AHL players eating in the wings then we can start trading our youth...until then the Oil need to focus there efforts on organizational depth...until that happens we shouldn’t deal youth or picks

745 2018-05-03 22:05:29 I just put coconut oil in my hair and now my room smells wonderfully 
746 2018-05-03 22:05:29 Since they starting on the new pipeline, I can only assume the good folks running the oil have repaired and cleaned up all their current leaks. Right? Good Guy Oil?
747 2018-05-03 22:05:20 Trump is an idiot.  Still saying the snake oil is good for you, as you retch!
748 2018-05-03 22:05:17 Turbo Shaft is what we call the oil we put in our M1 tanks. Its pure coincidence lol!
749 2018-05-03 22:05:14 Pro tip: keep a essential oil diffuser going in your office so you can fart the day away 
750 2018-05-03 22:05:11 Spinach is loaded with vitamins A &amp; C, which help your body create sebum, the oil secreted by follicles to give your hair gloss &amp; shine.
751 2018-05-03 22:04:47 If it’s similar to oil paint and thinner dawn soap should be fine. They use it on penguins so it should work for jeans. It works for my paint brushes.
752 2018-05-03 22:04:42 i have such dry skin that if i wash my face in the morning my skin will peel off  but it’s clean every night and no oil in the morning at all
753 2018-05-03 22:04:22 Tis the season to forget that that lip balm you leave in the car is now molten oil/wax and spray it all over the car, yay
754 2018-05-03 22:04:11 Thanks for correcting me :) 
And absolutely is one of the driving forces of Global warning. We complain about oil but surely know how to not save it.
755 2018-05-03 22:04:00 I can’t say “oil” without sounding like I grew up on a farm
756 2018-05-03 22:03:55 use chopsticks more when cooking. They’re especially great to move bacon around easily on the pan and still keep a safe distance from hot oil splatter.
757 2018-05-03 22:03:55 that’s actually so bad for your hair!! when you wash your hair a lot you strip your scalp’s natural oils so it makes more oil to compensate and actually makes your hair greasy quicker!! if you stop washing your hair every day it will be healthier and less greasy trust me
758 2018-05-03 22:03:50 1) less than half a barrel of oil goes to gas. The rest goes 2other produts, contacts, materials, plastics ect ect. so even if we switched to renewables we would still use oil! 2) blaming big oil for providing a product u use is like blaming a utensil factory 4 making ppl fat!
759 2018-05-03 22:03:48 I'm pretty sure #rossdouthat thinks sex is some rare natural resource like oil, and he doesn't actually know what it is.
760 2018-05-03 22:03:38 I'm pretty disappointed with this government backpedaling on its promises. Fair warning, almost every liberal I know is going to vote Conservative specifically to hold this party accountable for its lack of actions on key issues and for its expansion of oil exploitation.
761 2018-05-03 22:03:37 I really appreciate y8ur concern, but when I got my license last year, the dr said it doesn't help with COPD and seemed to be in a hurry to "put me through " . I really don't think there is anyone around here to help me. I tried a CBD dominant low thc oil

I don’t shellac my face with makeup every day — maybe a dab of concealer & sunscreen on errand days — but I love how it removes dirt and oil in general without stripping my skin.

Try some regardless of if you use makeup.

804 2018-05-03 21:58:38 I heard Altman would just shoot and then focus on characters being interesting.

Worst Oklahoma governor on record and you still wasn’t good enough for Trump’s cabinet. Hahaha
837 2018-05-03 21:53:09 Yes of course, because the Kremlin paid the troll farm to do this out of real concern for the environment, not because Russia sees US domestic oil production as a threat to its dominance over the industry
838 2018-05-03 21:53:08 Will an olive and olive oil tasting be included? This place looks amazing!

843 2018-05-03 21:52:03 That’s when Venezuela went into economic collapse, they didn’t have any other industry other than oil. So socialism really isn’t to blame for the collapse. The true blame is being dependent on one industry.
844 2018-05-03 21:51:46 AS never seemed to get traction from the start eg Inj b4 TC then early in season and when he was finally healthy and playing well the coach would Inexplicably tie him down to the 4th line for the most part.
845 2018-05-03 21:51:44 Yeah same here and the lack of actual balls in play is a big problem. The other thing that I miss, is the shift has taken away the potential for a ton a great defensive plays on the infield but completely get why teams to do it.
846 2018-05-03 21:51:35 I've only been home three days and my mom already has me adding pure coconut oil to my coffee to improve the clarity of my mind
847 2018-05-03 21:51:25 That’s so you  i remember when you used to use olive oil 
848 2018-05-03 21:51:24 I saw a clip on the news they use that nut in the tree the goats eat and poop oot' for a high end oil...

851 2018-05-03 21:51:17 I'm just more accepting that sometimes the first punch is a knockout. I know the one hit wonder shame you feel on this one its ok; I'm a Midnight Oil fan

859 2018-05-03 21:50:28 I think you are being a little misleading here. Do I want socialism? No, but the problem is bigger than that. In order to sustain socialism how Hugo wanted, he needed to keep an influx of cash and balance the budget which didn’t happen. When oil prices fell(oil dependent country)
860 2018-05-03 21:50:21 that game has been played before.  

you guys unfortunately lack a plan that can even be commented on.  i feel sad for the oil of western canada.

863 2018-05-03 21:50:05 I worked at burger king and when the barrel of dirty, boiling hot chip oil was too hot for me to pick up, I poured a bucket of cold water in to "cool it down" and it splooged out everywhere in the kitchen and also somehow into the manager's office.

866 2018-05-03 21:49:38 Well. I made broccoli with olive oil, black pepper, lemon juice, and Parmesan cheese, because I read that people that don't like broccoli think it's tasty. They were wrong. I still hate broccoli.

868 2018-05-03 21:49:34 We pay for our own healthcare in BC and Federal taxes that AB gets in transfer payments; Alberta doesn't and BCs economy makes more than AB sludge. We use publicly owned Hydro and it powers California and parts of Alberta. Please stop spreading lies for oil.

873 2018-05-03 21:49:05 Definitely has changed for various reasons. Personally, I miss the running game and the ability to manufacture runs, but you still need to do those things to win the WS as we've seen with HOU and KC recently.
874 2018-05-03 21:48:41 Definitely not good enough, at least Marco and particularly Stroman.

882 2018-05-03 21:47:19 You could always get oil that has a stronger concentration of oil. @NaturesUltra oil ranges from 500mg’s to 4500mg’s per the 30ml bottle it comes in. Then you won’t have to take as much each day. DM me if you want a promo code to buy their product. Let me know how it goes

886 2018-05-03 21:47:08 If someone comes in with £30m to invest - it’s just what Celtic make if they sell Dembele not to mention champions league revenue. King is a snake oil salesman and Gerrard a mug if he falls for it.

889 2018-05-03 21:46:54 Hubby getting oil changed and anytime I'm on a car lot I think of all the possibilities like is a minivan in my future? . Can't see me advancing to that level. Think I'll stick in the SUV lane.
890 2018-05-03 21:46:49 Also $80 for an oil change is theft
891 2018-05-03 21:46:45 idc what anyone says, i’m continuing to believe my salt lamp and essential oil diffuser combination solves every physical, mental, and emotional problem until i get cold hard evidence that suggests otherwise.

894 2018-05-03 21:46:27 1/2 How are you reconciling the fact that current coal exports from BC will achieve comparable CO2 global release numbers in 28 years compared to the 65 years for the oil that the article quotes? More than twice as fast? And this coal is from the US too dirty for them to export
895 2018-05-03 21:46:16 Forgot to mention family Mafias inheriting power beating up journalist and suspending parliament on a wimp 
Being subseviant to the ottomans against own people selling oil on the cheap to Israel while withholding teachers wages and bankrupting regional government
896 2018-05-03 21:46:15 Gosh, so bad for the waist line! Yeah the oil can be annoying but I have an Aunty from a francophone African country and the way she makes it is so different from the naija way, almost like she didn’t use oil in frying it

912 2018-05-03 21:44:05 Listen I’m just tryna be like that person that rub oil on the chicks in videos
913 2018-05-03 21:44:04 I agree they share that despicable quality, though I would not couch it as a NY thing. As a native NYer who can speak loudly and quickly but honestly, I would call it instead a snake oil salesman thing.
914 2018-05-03 21:44:01 Crock pot queso:

Big chuck of white American from the deli. 1/2-1 lbs. cubed

Add a touch of oil to crock pot and then minced red onion, red pepper and jalapeño.

Add cheese - stir as it melts  eventually adding a liquid like light beer or chicken stock. 

Top with green onion.

920 2018-05-03 21:43:34 Let's hope that we in Wales are not going to be just spectators in this industry. We aren't blessed with oil & gas fields, coal has had its day but we do have huge tidal potential. Can we benefit for once, from our natural resources ?

925 2018-05-03 21:43:17 I don't think a demolition is terrorists attack ? What happened in Persia uppal? Was the oil worth losing lives in 17 different continent I don't even own a vehicle and in general?
926 2018-05-03 21:43:03 Picture this, if you will: an incredibly dazzling and wondrous ISTJ oil heiress, wearing a red satin halter top, meticulously galloping along a magical beach at sunset on a white-blotched chestnut brown Camargue horse.

932 2018-05-03 21:42:11 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
933 2018-05-03 21:42:11 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

937 2018-05-03 21:41:20 My grandparents came here with NOTHING. my grandfather learned to sew, my grandmother raised 12 children .. her grandchildren pay taxes, theyve worked on off shore oil rigs, raised children of their own and one has pioneered life saving treatments for pediatric cancer. FU Trump
938 2018-05-03 21:41:10 Also, let's be honest here, the only guy who has been consistent is Happ, w/ Sanchez slowly rounding into to form. The other three haven't been good at all.
939 2018-05-03 21:41:06 I sure love thigh chafing and having a perpetual film of sweat and oil perpetually covering my body this time of year.

946 2018-05-03 21:39:56 Oil changes used to be like $35 back in the day. how the hell did they rise up to $78 for a standard now? I still only get 3k miles and they're still doing the exact same checks they were doing 10 years ago. I don't understand this madness

952 2018-05-03 21:39:23 I'm trying to train my hair into a new wash pattern and hopefully combat excess oil by cutting down the amount I wash it during the week. 

I washed it YESTERDAY and it's already getting greasy AF

Something tells me this is gonna be a longgg process.
953 2018-05-03 21:39:22 Oooh shit!  It’s officially liquid coconut oil season!!! 
954 2018-05-03 21:39:17 See this is why you go for a balsamic vinegar and olive oil if you want to still have some healthy salad that doesn't taste like a shredded book report.

A year in which there is much oil is blessed, the people eat of it and [also] the rooms
956 2018-05-03 21:39:09 Building the extension means that avenues for further exploitation and extraction open up. Doesn’t matter how “safe” it is to transport bitumen... all oil is dirty
957 2018-05-03 21:39:03 My eyebrows have grown so much since using castor oil and Vaseline tbh
958 2018-05-03 21:38:57 are you an oil paint sapphic, a fingerpaint sapphic, or an oil pastel sapphic? a Mulan sapphic or a Lady and the Tramp sapphic?

963 2018-05-03 21:38:26 Before I cleaned the shop dust off the legs and sealed them. Next time they get sealed immediately after the oil so dust won't collect. I need to build a clean room.
964 2018-05-03 21:38:26 Then she shouldn’t ban oil exploration with no evidence it will achieve anything and zero consultation
965 2018-05-03 21:38:23 No question he has his flaws as a player but the lack of opportunity remains a puzzle. As does the expectation for a guy they are paying $1M and not dressing.

967 2018-05-03 21:38:09 #styrofoam. Ugly. Styrene is probably a human #carcinogen. Hard to collect for #recycljng because it is so light. Often contaminated with food waste. Hard to compact enough to make it transportable. Sony once had a program to take it back & dissolve it in orange oil from peels.
968 2018-05-03 21:38:09 Kerosene nko, pepper nko, palm oil/groundnut nko.?
969 2018-05-03 21:37:57 You did that lazor treatment so it’s gonna take a while. Growing a beard that nerve at first, but it will fill in. Beard oil and patience my guy. No quitters round here

971 2018-05-03 21:37:48 It was AWFUL. strapped down to a table, oil in ear, buzzing, and buzzing . Just AWFUL.
972 2018-05-03 21:37:43 I called my dad about an oil change situation and I’m ready to flip shit and he’s laughing and joking talking bout “don’t be stressing baby girl, I got you”  NO MAN CAN EVER TOP HIM

974 2018-05-03 21:37:31 Don’t miss tomorrow’s video! It’s going to be very informative. I don’t think people grasp what the petrocoin discount really means. Oil is the #1 commodity in the world.

977 2018-05-03 21:36:49 Well we take it through the car wash every morning.... gotta look sharp! Nevermind the oil from the blown o ring all over the back of the tractor. All jokes aside it sits out for planting season then sits in the shed the rest of the time
978 2018-05-03 21:36:29 There are a lot of other jobs and opportunities! Grab hold of one! The oil and gas industry is doing great, the manufacturing companies are hiring, GOYA and grab hold of opportunity!

980 2018-05-03 21:36:21 You probably don't have the brain power to research it, but the Sierra Club and others are being paid off to fight against our pipelines by us oil companies who do not want competition.

1005 2018-05-03 21:32:37 Appreciate the correction Steven. I think it would be fair to say oil was at least one major pillar of the Indy argument. If your argument is not an economic one (mine largely is) totally understand you’ll have a different perspective.

1131 2018-05-03 21:13:06 by doing what exactly? Punishing white males? Shall we do same with white male dominated fields like welders & oil/gas industry workers? Dammit, there aren't enough white male nurses. Let's punish women to even that out..

1133 2018-05-03 21:12:23 Love coconut oil! 
1134 2018-05-03 21:12:17 Yeah I have gone through two and a half bottles of Sally's cuticle oil, and it does the job.
1135 2018-05-03 21:12:14 olive oil is better anyway for that ;)
1136 2018-05-03 21:11:47 so I came to get my car inspected and get an oil change anddddd my car is disgusting I'm so embarrassed 
1137 2018-05-03 21:11:22 'Bout time, Bernie.

I never got why you didn't part ways with the war pigs at the Clinton trough on wars for Israel and Saudi oil ~ which we ALL know Syria "war" is a CIA/HRC invention over SA pipeline.
1138 2018-05-03 21:11:05 Please share this trick?  What do you do with the oil? Not to sound stupid but never used before lol I've been taking an allergy pill daily and would love to switch to natural remedy instead.
1139 2018-05-03 21:10:56 @JimTurn30433019 Frankly, rather gov't get my money as it comes back in services and helping society. Major oil company enriches shareholders who are one percenters who put their money in offshore accounts for the most part. Let's agree to disagree on this one.
1140 2018-05-03 21:10:49 I took this natural journey with my best friend/play sister @svcourtney truth be told I already natural it’s just now I’m not getting hot oil treatment I lowkey wanna be over the shit lol
1141 2018-05-03 21:10:46 Would that snake oil be Kim Jong-Un releasing 3 US prisoners, a Trump demand?
1142 2018-05-03 21:10:44 Romaine lettuce has killed more peoole than my ARs
1143 2018-05-03 21:10:39 Plz do my good sis bring out the oil too
1144 2018-05-03 21:10:38 So the allergens have moved to my skin? 

Made a peppy smelling oil from good olive oil with a few drops of lemon grass oil (and one drop of tea tree oil) to stop the itches. 

So far so good. Helps me to leave #AllergyJail too.
1145 2018-05-03 21:10:36 I actually am wondering what happened to the other half of Iran's money. It was $3.4 billion we froze when Iran took hostages. Of course, it's Iran's money from an oil sale.They paid $millions to hostages and settled all litigation.We were facing international sanctions if keep.
1146 2018-05-03 21:10:32 Kissinger steered the feb 74 int. conference on the oil crisis in Wash. This led to the start of western plans for energy independence from OPEC. Republicans were more interested In fraking than energy conservation. Ford brought in weatherization & energy conservation standards!
1147 2018-05-03 21:10:25 I just did that a few weeks ago, also while applying castor oil  Ouch!
1148 2018-05-03 21:10:18 Hell nah ! I love the gas prices ! Oil field baby !

1157 2018-05-03 21:09:22 But DT’s first response is always lying. No matter what it is about, he’ll lie or exaggerate so much it becomes a lie. He’s a snake oil salesman. Pity he is also president.
1158 2018-05-03 21:08:46 Pruitt? Pollution? Zinke? Giving our nat'l parks to oil companies? Guilliani just admitted trumps guilt. Rubio openly admitting tax scam is a scam. And thune stays silent. Anything for your greed john?
1159 2018-05-03 21:08:27 The massage oil?
1160 2018-05-03 21:08:23 Trains need people on them. Not oil.
1161 2018-05-03 21:08:15 Hundreds of people killed in the North in the past week. Northern elders move on with their lives like it's nothing. Just mention let's divide the country or restructure and there will be series of emergency meetings all over the North. Meaning - oil over human lives.
1162 2018-05-03 21:07:52 I got it as a gift, but it's just Seacret's Cuticle Oil - as far as I can tell, it is an all-natural deal and $$$$$$$ but skincare and especially NAILS and hand care is something I will drop mad bank on.
1163 2018-05-03 21:07:47 they wont...congress needs oil...... from the ME
cant hurt their sentiments
1164 2018-05-03 21:07:37 The obvious question kind of fish oil? 
And automate finances? How did u do that
1165 2018-05-03 21:07:29 I poked myself in the eye with a spoolie when I was putting castor oil in my eyelashes, so, same.
1166 2018-05-03 21:07:25 Trim the hair around that patch and bathe with a diluted solution of Tea tree oil , will soothe the irritation.
1167 2018-05-03 21:07:22 A guy from Kzn died In church during the service  last weekend .... why didn't he resurrect him....and the lion of juder oil was it not working ... clearly all this so called miracles r staged .....ppl wake up
1168 2018-05-03 21:07:06 Well ladies my car engine over heated the oil and antifreeze leaked out and I’m stranded on the side of the highway waiting for my Dad to come with my phone at 35% crying my eyes out
1169 2018-05-03 21:06:58 Oil me up & put me in a shirt 
1170 2018-05-03 21:06:58 Wait, you want an oil to depilate certain parts of your body ?!
1171 2018-05-03 21:06:56 Awww that’s so nice!!! I messaged you about ordering oil for my mom! She’s super excited!
1172 2018-05-03 21:06:55 Arsenal aren’t even in Europe next year. City is oil money so you’d expect that. United could lose fa and win nothing. Chelsea shit club also could lose and win nothing. Liverpool basking in a true one season wonder won’t win anything. Spurs are building long term. 3rd straight
1173 2018-05-03 21:06:53 I got oil in my bedroom
1174 2018-05-03 21:06:46 My bosses are a beautiful husband and wife team in NJ that are making billions in architectural design and real estate. #I believe this is prophetic. #Lord let that oil flow!!!
1175 2018-05-03 21:06:41 I know it's too hot in this bitch when my stash of coconut oil is completely liquified and my shea butter doesn't require physical force to work into my hair
1176 2018-05-03 21:06:38 Tea tree oil saves lives
1177 2018-05-03 21:06:32 Snake oil and used car salesman
1178 2018-05-03 21:06:18 I’ve been trying coconut oil. Going to get castor oil & try it 
1179 2018-05-03 21:06:11 @senJamesInhofe I
missed to tell you about some of the 200 contaminating chemicals use in fracking for oil
extraction, which by the way this is causing earthquakes in the world,
documented and proven. Great source of info is Alex Backman among other info. H
1180 2018-05-03 21:05:54 I love coconut oil 
1181 2018-05-03 21:05:42 Some bread dipped in some olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and various herbs oh baby
1182 2018-05-03 21:05:26 Dude, I love cuticle oil. What do you use?
1183 2018-05-03 21:05:22 What method Ferrari used to have the most powerful engine? Oil or hydraulic fluid seems not to be (by FIA), With so much steam at the start will have Mercedes engineers thought that may be the secret in the controlled addition of coolant (special, of course) since is not limited?
1184 2018-05-03 21:05:19 I still have limited experience, the one that sticks out for me though is new world oil and gas. Most said that was no risk??

1186 2018-05-03 21:04:55 but no opposition to BC importing fuels from refineries in US by pipelines or ships or Cdn oil arriving in BC by rail, Left only oppose Cdn oil in pipelines.
1187 2018-05-03 21:04:50 I'm allergic to tea tree oil. I can't put that anywhere near my skin or scalp.
1188 2018-05-03 21:04:44 More trolls. @GarrettSills is one of those dumb dumbs who just goes long and hopes things happen. He can't tell you any fundamental argument for higher oil. He is one of those that feels like a genius when SA distorts the market and he locks into profit. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil
1189 2018-05-03 21:04:32 No because my oil changes are 2x as much, tires are more, fuels more, maintenance is more
1190 2018-05-03 21:04:06 I think you give the collection of social workers, teachers, and a few lawyers far more credit than they deserve.  The only thing deliberate is their intent to tax the hell out of oil to pay for profligate spending
1191 2018-05-03 21:04:03 BUT it is also pretty satisfying to learn how to do this stuff for yourself. In the last year or so I’ve started changing my oil, rotating tires, and now changing batteries myself. Glad to not have to pay people for this stuff anymore lol
1192 2018-05-03 21:03:40 But has anyone used coconut oil as lube? I’m just curious lol
1193 2018-05-03 21:03:33 Dang. I thought you were going to say: they are doing great! And I could get my one good thing.... welp.... for a while we put olive oil or peanut butter in Lexie's food when she was picky. It helped the transition a bit.
1194 2018-05-03 21:03:32 The dude who drops off oil ended up taking the used oil contaminating his whole batch
1195 2018-05-03 21:03:13 I got this massage in Singapore and it came with a hot oil tummy rub. It was the most serious tummy rub ever, and during it the lady told me I was very beautiful - I think she meant my tummy 
1196 2018-05-03 21:03:10 Hey CBD Oil Info Place thanks for the follow!
1197 2018-05-03 21:02:57 I am also convinced that the powers thar be have a similar button every time oil gets close to breaking the 67 handle. What a joke WTI is nowadays.
1198 2018-05-03 21:02:49 Brought my car in for a simple oil change. $425.00 later and I still have no idea what the hell just happened...again!
1199 2018-05-03 21:02:41 @Clicks_SA went to clicks today after and boght Nido,cough mixture and lavender oil for my son,i was given a citronella oil and it burned my son's earclicks Randburg mall im coming for you tomorrow

1210 2018-05-03 21:01:29 How to cook thai green curry with Rory:

- add blended paste, fry for 2 mins
- add coconut milk, bring to boil
- cram variety of vegetables in until you create a black hole the size of your cooking vessel

1215 2018-05-03 21:00:59 The earliest written evidence of lube is from ancient Greece in 350 B.C., when olive oil was used with leather dildos.

1228 2018-05-03 21:00:15 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1246 2018-05-03 20:57:29 I guess your physician also operated patients w/o anesthesia and used snake oil.
1247 2018-05-03 20:57:20 Oil rigs in the sea, in the atlantic, quite far out, you can get it from there.
1248 2018-05-03 20:57:18 Not really, money in football has now just took over the game, every league; when a rich club sees a player with potential in Ligue 1 they’re immediately snatched up, making it easier for oil clubs like PSG to score, win games and titles.

1250 2018-05-03 20:56:45 There’s a offshore drilling rig & museum in gavelston tx. Learned there wasn’t anything in place to stop oil spills before that incident. They sat the 4 heads of major oil companies down to come up with a plan for future incidents
1251 2018-05-03 20:56:40 No, it's the just oil cooler gasket, apparently it's sorta common 
It's been going on for a while, should be a simple fix

1265 2018-05-03 20:55:04 "When they relax legalizaiton in the States, we have an export industry potentially as big as Oil". I'm sorry Tony- you have no understanding of UN treaties we are signatory to (unchanged with Can/US legalization) and implacations therein around export of non-medical #cannabis.
1266 2018-05-03 20:55:01 It’s going to be a challenge alright for some orgs, especially as they haven’t even started any GDPR prep yet. Will also be some work to do to put things right after all the snake oil salesmen have moved on to the next big thing.
1267 2018-05-03 20:54:48 Oh look, it’s the “You can’t criticize the disinfo campaign of Big Oil if you use any petro products!!” no-logic argument. Newsflash: we ALL have to use petro products until the paradigm has shifted to renewables, which is what this BS campaign is designed to delay...
1268 2018-05-03 20:54:39 Only an idiot wouldn’t know what is going on in Syria. The US and UK are helping Israel “obtain” the country because it wants it. The oil, the country, the history, Israel wants it all.
1269 2018-05-03 20:54:38 Oh come on Canadians.... The oil share holders want to spend a few months in the French Riviera and buy the latest Ferrari for their little princess. Oh and remodel the kitchen, hey its now a year old and out dated.
1270 2018-05-03 20:54:34 I hope you left the oil at home so you dont get caught slipping
1271 2018-05-03 20:54:22 The devil will try to come in any way they can. I want to throw some Holy Oil on this lady cause she is the devil just NEGATIVE, LOST & need JESUS ..
1272 2018-05-03 20:54:08 My opinion is this Is not a Real visual of jupiter. Looks like an oil painting
1273 2018-05-03 20:54:04 Ever vape CBD oil. Liquid Gold 5ml is the best. Really relax you.
1274 2018-05-03 20:53:58 I’ve been secretly car shopping for my kids first car and I’m SO frustrated with bogus Craiglist ads! ‘Has a little surface rust’ get there and the floor boards are rotted out. ‘Needs nothing’ oh, so the puddle of oil is just car sweat? JUST BE HONEST, FFS!
1275 2018-05-03 20:53:53 Ugh have the biggest crush on a guy who changes the oil on my car  like I want him so bad to be mine but I’m too shy to tell him
1276 2018-05-03 20:53:50 If Israel airstrike iran, oil prices could increase to 200 $ barrel, but this not good for US
1277 2018-05-03 20:53:37 The cash released to Iran was their money which was frozen not long after Islamic Revolution. The CIA is reponsible for issues in Iran after instilling the Shah. Iran issue is about banking and oil. Read up on it
1278 2018-05-03 20:53:27 Dam Evan seems a little excessive for an oil change 
1279 2018-05-03 20:53:27 I didn't think I'd be celebrating the end of my semester by listening to a podcast on the topic of "teaching men on oil rigs how to cry", but here I am. Thanks @NPRinvisibilia
1280 2018-05-03 20:53:19 I got my oil change, now I just need gas and a car wash... but I was thinking maybe I should hand wash my car first...
1281 2018-05-03 20:53:10 You think scientists, people who have all their work & methodology scrutinised by ethics committees & who make very, very low incomes, are trying to foist a yuge scam on society, for no personal gain, and the only people who can stop them are a plucky group of oil billionaires.
1282 2018-05-03 20:52:55 2/2 ..collect the dividend, get paid while u wait the market out thru the noise of the news and sell in May period. Oil is up yo support the idea and it is summer so the timing is right. So now I can go to the lake or beach or vacation with the kids and not worry about it until..

1285 2018-05-03 20:52:10 Trump supporters say they didn’t voted for a pastor. True. They voted for a lying, cheating, crooked snake oil salesman who is stealing from the poor and giving it to the rich. Reverse Robin Hood. #ImpeachTrump
1286 2018-05-03 20:52:09 Have educated the son-in-law in the fine art of changing the oil on a Subaru.  Always fun.
1287 2018-05-03 20:51:51 She might not have Voted for Trump but she’s definitely associated with Russia and Big Oil. There’s plenty of Evidence Supporting that.
1288 2018-05-03 20:51:44 Mass transit in the US is terrible also. Crushed by the auto and oil industries decades ago.
1289 2018-05-03 20:51:44 I specifically tell my dad to NOT drive my Z cause I need to change a gasket that's causing it to leak oil and guess what he does

1292 2018-05-03 20:51:15 Oh! Cerave (the kind with the pump and the squat jar) has saved my legs from eczema. I also sometimes chase with Acure body oil (comes in a spray bottle, very easy to apply).
1293 2018-05-03 20:51:08 Too bad she was right.  And remember, you're not qualified to call anybody a moron, you're being played by a bunch of snake oil salesmen.
1294 2018-05-03 20:51:05 day 4 using coconut oil to remove my eyemakeup and literally my rash/eczema around my eyes which ive had the past 2-3 months has almost completely healed  but my skin is breaking out a little on my forehead :( i need to see if its the coconut oil or just my hormones lol
1295 2018-05-03 20:51:03 Natsuki brags about getting a job and stuff and learn to paint with oil and watercolour
1296 2018-05-03 20:50:30 Hi, Tati I just watched ur video on the cake mix, I watched a few vids on this, have u tried it with the oil? Apparently if u mix it in with the oil, it is easier too move around. Forgot what the oil is called? It’s there oil drops. Yellow in colour. Xx

Please take a break & let your real ones relax also use organic coconut oil on your real lashes in between installs for growth, I recommend a install with 2 fill-ins at the most then let your real ones RELAX
1302 2018-05-03 20:49:03 Omg I pocket typed this. I am so sorry. I was changing my oil
1303 2018-05-03 20:48:50 my manager gave me 10 dollar & paid for my oil change  I think he’s up to something

1312 2018-05-03 20:47:21 woman just walked into midas and said she got her oil changed here and it was leaking, turns out that was a huge lie, but they’re gonna fix it for her for free anyway 
1313 2018-05-03 20:47:17 More expensive was the use of mixes of super heated oil, lead ,acid, and mercury to inlay 'real' gold edges. Health and safety didn't appear to be around for manual handling in medieval times.

1315 2018-05-03 20:46:39 Chef Ramses cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with grass.
1316 2018-05-03 20:46:36 Oil . I'm against big oil treating BC as if its business as usual to push expansion 4 their benefit alone
1317 2018-05-03 20:46:34 Should not get too far divorced from days of forward cover. Demand is likely stronger than many are contemplating and oil's strength is likely more than just an Iran bet. Traders see that is my guess
1318 2018-05-03 20:46:33 I would prefer to see long convoys of tanker trucks hauling to the coast. Put a lot more people to work.  We could plug up the roads down there everyday, just when people who say they are against our oil, need to get on the roads to drive to work.
1319 2018-05-03 20:46:24 Father, show compassion to the compassionate. let their oil never run dry
1320 2018-05-03 20:46:23 I don’t think oil is that bad tbh
1321 2018-05-03 20:46:15 a ultima data de reajuste combustiveis anunciada pela PETROBR foi em 19/fevereiro, ou houve outra posterior? de 19/02 em diante o OIL subiu 7%, gasolina (futuro NY) 15%, e o o USD na Rep de Bananias subiu 7%. Houve quanto de reajuste da PBR após 19/02?

1327 2018-05-03 20:45:28 @RachelStarrxxx What was the name of the beard oil you were spokespersoning for a while back? I'm looking for a good one. I have a frizz problem.
1328 2018-05-03 20:45:08 So there is nothing wrong with our Stolen crude oil being transferred to US illegally?
A country who is suppose to be our allie is Sabotage our economy,yet u don't want our govt to even ask WHY?
Let be reasonable & rational,with out US oil dollars,PMB has no business going there
1329 2018-05-03 20:45:00 Could I ask that you could also stop using palm oil?
1330 2018-05-03 20:44:45 Yup, just birds, fish, 20,000 tonnes of crude oil, oh and the part of the ship the front fell off!
1331 2018-05-03 20:44:45 “Prevent and reverse heart disease” by dr Esselstyn is a good place to start. It’s a bit dated though and fairly strict. Bottom line is he promotes all veggies and absolutely no oil. Which is countered by more recent research.
1332 2018-05-03 20:44:37 olive oil. got it. I’ll pick some up.
1333 2018-05-03 20:44:28 “I’ve got the oil if you’ve got the time.”
1334 2018-05-03 20:44:25 You'll know an oil spill when you see one. Check out #BasrahOilSpill collection. I don't see a spill in yours because it's the same water surface as on May 1st. When I review 08:00 UTC today, I count 10 search party boats. There's an AIS ban here, from the behavior we've seen.
1335 2018-05-03 20:44:15 Also try to use less oil, or even a less processed oil like olive oil
1336 2018-05-03 20:44:12 I’ve only done oil or acrylics.....but yeah, super relaxing.  Therapeutic even!

1344 2018-05-03 20:43:16 How did you explain your unquestioning and unwavering support of Trump and the environmentally destructive fossil fuel industry? Have you told your constituents that they get to pick up cost of climate change destruction while Big Oil pockets the profits?
1345 2018-05-03 20:43:11 Iran didn't want to be strong armed by UK & US. UK & US plotted w/insurgents to topple the Shah. All about oil control. Prior to that, Iran was a strong ally with US. Please google for greater detail. Many died & eventually lead to embassy take over and rift in Middle East.
1346 2018-05-03 20:42:38 there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil

1351 2018-05-03 20:42:08 You forget, in the past teams have oil tycoons owning them. We walked over teams.
Suddenly a billionaire comes in, injects hundreds of millions into a club and buys the best players, so you can’t attack these “lower” teams like we used to because they are just as good

1356 2018-05-03 20:40:46 Downright laughable that .@PressSec labels herself as a “decent human”  while she repeatedly vomits up lie after lie while screaming “WITCH HUNT” and “FAKE NEWS” at our free press, all on behalf of a conman snake oil salesman.

Is that better?
1368 2018-05-03 20:38:13 There is no country with oil depending on another source to generate revenue.
Every country with out oil has their own resources they depend on,oil is what Nigeria has.
We not talking leadership,we discussing Nigeria US relations. U don't loos ur biggest buyer & not ask questions

1387 2018-05-03 20:35:52 Lots of snake oil out there being sold to investors but like anything, lots of good stuff too. Commendable to see some of these green orgs (like 100 Thieves, Gen.G, Clutch, Philly Fusion, and NYXL) perform well without much experience in the space.
1388 2018-05-03 20:35:43 This is why snake oil sold so well in the south. #stupidrepubs

"so I just got of the phone with (enter any defense contractor/weapons manufacturer/big steel/big oil/...)  ... and yes we are working for world war, yes"
1399 2018-05-03 20:34:13 Beijing reasserted its right to build "defense" facilities in the disputed region, declined to confirm reports it had installed new missiles on artificial islands it had built. It sees the area as key to pushing its defenses beyond its coast and securing Crude Oil supply routes

1402 2018-05-03 20:34:07 Not all utilities look good. Its all about electric. This is what you discover when you comb thru the sector. Probably due to higher oil (yes u need oil to make electricity in many plants) and oh yeah..it's summer.
1403 2018-05-03 20:34:05 I usually the green olive oil deep conditioner with the palmers coconut protein pack. Prayer and deep conditioner is all I can do

You're also bat-shit crazy on this solar flare stuff, and need to read. I posted the link, read it.

And I’d also like to send a universal shout out to all the nice and kind people willing to help one another! 
THANK YOU!!!

1424 2018-05-03 20:31:23 Ask a person what causes inflation....

Depending on who you talk too, you'll get two different answers or a host of reasoning. 

Quality of life, higher wages...

Others say greed and capitalism...it's the 1% and oil companies that create inflation.

1427 2018-05-03 20:31:05 I used eat that all the time when I was there. It really makes a difference marinated in oil. You're going to put at least a stone on in weight but it will be worth it.

1432 2018-05-03 20:30:42 Because they nationalised their own oil and booted the UK out. The US/UK using communism as the excuse was then, had that regime overthrown and a puppet installed. We’ve seen this time and time again.

1442 2018-05-03 20:29:46 Thousands across Canada have been affected and threatened by the cutbacks in the oil and gas industry. I can't speak to Amazon however the pipeline creates thousands of jobs, be it permanent, temp or contract...both directly and indirectly.

1473 2018-05-03 20:25:51 Nawww. But they last 6-8 mo and work better than the monthly medication/oil
1474 2018-05-03 20:25:29 Reputationally? Hasn't really happened. VW has paid heavy price re fines/buying back cars with potentially more fines/action to come. Re BP, oil spills always emotive. Altho BP got the blame, Swiss+US firms also heavily involved. Brit bashing by the yanks? Surely not... ;-)
1475 2018-05-03 20:25:14 Been there. Here's my trick: chop the zucchini in thick half circles (like cut it in half then chop in slices) and sautée it in a little oil (the better you can afford calorie-wise, the better it'll taste). Then add whatever pasta sauce you'd use on the zoodles. Give it a try
1476 2018-05-03 20:25:13 Just ordered my first bottle of CBD oil that’s suppose to help with pain. Please let this work out cus I’m going to have to have something other than weak ass Tylenol that doesn’t even touch it. Here’s to hoping I can start to get out of bed every day after this.

1479 2018-05-03 20:24:51 Yep. I eat a lot of salads and don’t really like salad dressing. Just oil, vinegar, salt, maybe garlic.

1482 2018-05-03 20:24:28 Yeah, sometimes they take an UNREASONABLY long time for an oil change depending on what time of day you go.
1483 2018-05-03 20:24:22 Your last two posts, one referring to an oil pipeline leaking (it was an oil well according to the 1st paragraph of the article) and this (wrong amount of ppl shot)...what are you doing man? I followed you at one point bc of your reporting, but this is just lazy clickbait bs
1484 2018-05-03 20:24:14 Chai, the way dis kaduna girls like car  u go tink say dere mama breastfeed dem with engine oil.
1485 2018-05-03 20:24:11 Yes, like our oil which is completely worthless and is a terrible burden, our baby boxes are of the dangerous kind and should not be used by anyone ever.

1489 2018-05-03 20:23:51 Forgot to follow with how I did it. 

Yes,i used Coconut oil with tea tree oil and sugar. I leave the sugar as is though and from the articles ive read and videos i watched its okay and it feels good when i rub in circles. Still need to read up more about this oneMy first time
1490 2018-05-03 20:23:51 In the philippines u can cook an egg outside by putting a pan with oil on the asphalt. Summer is too hot here 
1491 2018-05-03 20:23:44 Dee the complete sentence in the end of the chorus is "huevos con aceite y limón" (eggs with oil and lemon). Here in Chile we sing it like that.
1492 2018-05-03 20:22:57 I have been trying to grow back my hairline for over two years. I'm constantly massaging it with black Jamaica Castor oil, I was even told to try Dermatol which just causes my scalp to be greasy and clog my pores. I believe I would be the best candidate to try the products. :)

1499 2018-05-03 20:22:33 The environment is planet wide. Canada has almost no environmental impact, but we are willingly martyring ourselves while the real abusers ramp up production. 

We could displace oil from those countries with Canadian product, making an ACTUAL impact of global emissions.

Wondering how many college students tried the olive oil trick this past weekend.
1501 2018-05-03 20:22:26 Has @SecretaryZinke trained them to sell land rights to his oil and gas buddies?
1502 2018-05-03 20:22:22 Not sure how this fragrance oil is going to behave, but read that it accelerates trace. Have the oils cooling down to room temp. so it'll give me a little more time to work with. Mango Papaya on it's way!
1503 2018-05-03 20:22:04 We cripple economies of countries who don't concede to our will. We're doing the same thing to Canada with a different approach. A socially acceptable approach because it's Canada. Their oil is our oil though. Make no mistake. We are their only customer and we like it that way.
1504 2018-05-03 20:21:58 Yassss cuzz get me together! I’m allergic to coconut oil though. Do sumn for ya eczema peoples! Lol

1510 2018-05-03 20:20:32 That’s helpful—good for times. What about approximate quantity? Anything like “It’ll need 2-ish quarts of oil”?
1511 2018-05-03 20:20:17 Please take a look at full spectrum hemp oil called Ultra Cell from Zilis. It has a very positive impact on the autoimmune system. lupus is complex. This might help. plz follow and we can talk via dm more privately. thnx
1512 2018-05-03 20:20:11 Right , and this would cost how much ? For what  ? - < 10% or the planet’s emissions ?:please tell me the relevance of this, as developing countries rely on high emissions coal to develop , & oil now @ ~ 100 mbpd , Gas now far behind
1513 2018-05-03 20:19:52 I could not and never would purchase a prosperity oil from someone with such low and negative energy that is in fact...broke. You are proving my point. But again I wish you the best. You can always unlock your account.
1514 2018-05-03 20:19:46 I remember TRP duster. News came in the morning. Thankfully I wasn't in but a lot of those made up their  losses the same afternoon when MSMN announced an "oil find". I was in MSMN
1515 2018-05-03 20:19:41 Yeah, otherwise they'd specify extra virgin olive oil
1516 2018-05-03 20:19:41 Eriksen, Toby, Jan... that oil money just going to buy our whole club or what? 
1517 2018-05-03 20:19:37 Oil
1518 2018-05-03 20:19:25 It's about control of oil. Just waiting for us to install the next puppet leader to restore the economy.
We weren't stockpiling our own oil for nothing. It was strategic. And, now look at us, #1 oil&gas exporter in the world for the first time
1519 2018-05-03 20:19:19 Hon Kizige:Resources are being put into the oil and gas sector so that the country largely benefits from it. After attaining enough profit from that, we can comfortably talk about increasing salaries. #NBSFrontLine

1527 2018-05-03 20:18:06 Is it a coincidence that my twitter feed is really boring the same day @Oil_Guns_Merica started his new job?
1528 2018-05-03 20:17:56 hi, so you can make a scalp rub at home that will help stimulate your scalp and promote hair growth and thicken what you have ^_^

domestic drilling is up so that we're not at the mercy of ME oil and have to send our soldiers there to protect some 2bit tyrant. Build a wall to keep illegals out. Especially after that SOB hit ...
1534 2018-05-03 20:17:19 Too bad we can't harness the gaslighting coming out of his mouth to reduce our dependency on imported oil.

1538 2018-05-03 20:16:30 The main problem started before the large amount of migration from Vancouver.

It started when a lot of people in Kelowna were working the oil rigs, and Albertans who worked the rigs bought homes in Kelowna. This whole douchebag, white male, culture.
1539 2018-05-03 20:16:23 Need to oil my scalp.
1540 2018-05-03 20:16:12 Good news on the car front. I got to my spa job, and was contacted that my starter needed to be replaced. It’s under warranty, so it’ll just be $88 for labor with an oil change added. But now I need to replace my struts and ball joints so my tires don’t just give out...
1541 2018-05-03 20:16:02 I cooked these in the oven and they were fine. No oil used 
1542 2018-05-03 20:15:59 FYI the war isn't about terrorism and no, my country isn't fighting for our freedom or anyone else's. Oil access and control.
1543 2018-05-03 20:15:52 Instead they elect a traitorous snake oil salesman who will be a big hit in prison.

1546 2018-05-03 20:15:40 Right - just in case the 'rule of law' that @JustinTrudeau has been bleeting about rules against them. This govt of this land @liberal_party is a rogue element working only for Big Oil. #UNDRIP #cdnpoli #bcpoli

1555 2018-05-03 20:14:15 This is why Pence in the VP slot is so chilling. Putin wants chaos and oil money. Pence, the Mercers, and their billionaire pals want the US to become a real life ‘Handmaid’s Tale,’ a radical ‘Christian Taliban’ theocracy. They’re also smart, well financed, and well organized.
1556 2018-05-03 20:14:05 Coconut  oil!
1557 2018-05-03 20:13:54 Let’s fundraiser for it. Let that fool live for a fortnight on Newstart. Let’s give her a flat with basic necessities. Prepaid phone, no Internet and a pantry with nothing but salt, oil and a packet of noodles. Ah yes and let her apply for jobs without a car.
1558 2018-05-03 20:13:29 You nailed it.   To add fuel to the flame.....have you ever compared a present day chicken to one raised 70 years ago?   It’s as if the present day version has been pumped up with air...especially in the breast meat.  A “super sized” seed oil with feathers.
1559 2018-05-03 20:13:21 Hedged? As in long oil as a hedge?
1560 2018-05-03 20:13:07 My grandma on the phone with me telling me how she secretly puts anointing oil on my aunt and lil brother. Talkn bout "I sled some across her lips and she didnt even realize what i was doin'. Haha"  My God.

1567 2018-05-03 20:12:20 Earnings in the O&G sector showing $65 oil isn't smooth sailing after all. Finally got a decent pullback after the recent strong move, but looks like most companies still need higher prices. Heavy oil producers also struggling with the weakness in WCS.
1568 2018-05-03 20:12:02 Just made sweet potato ‘chips’ in the oven (ie I cut up a few sweet pots, squirted with olive oil and some salt/paprika, and put them in for 25 mins) and I’m now wondering what on earth I’ve been doing with my time till this moment. Best decision ever. My life has truly peaked.
1569 2018-05-03 20:11:50 Yes!
1570 2018-05-03 20:11:43 Anyone know someone long oil because of the upcoming May 12 deadline?
1571 2018-05-03 20:11:20 That's why I mix it & add oil to it, cause it does, but it's the only thing that works for me lol.

1581 2018-05-03 20:10:13 Yeah, you've shown which side your bread is buttered. #WomensRevolution when it suits you, but stick it in the trash the moment that oil money shows up.

None of this means anything if you aren't willing to back it up when it's inconvenient.
1582 2018-05-03 20:10:10 I don't know how to do anything with it besides the oil change tbh. 
I don't mind waiting a couple days and paying a few bucks for someone to get it running, but I do mind the confusion.
1583 2018-05-03 20:10:10 If I gave u a cup of water with said shaved hair I’m pretty sure it would taste the same as ur beloved motor oil beverage

1588 2018-05-03 20:09:45 I think the markets are dead until later in the fall. I can't tell if it's gonna continue to be a rolling correction or a meltdown. With the exception of my oil stocks (doing very well), a couple funds, and few quality names, I'm 70% cash waiting for some enlightenment.
1589 2018-05-03 20:09:33 From someone who did landscaping on a commercial and private scale......how does an oil change and a tune up take that long?
1590 2018-05-03 20:09:31 does anyone have any recommendations for reducing redness from picking spots?? Like there’s no spot anymore there it’s just v red where it was. Bio oil or Kiehls midnight recovery hasn’t really helped at all.

1599 2018-05-03 20:08:23 These are macro photographs of a mixture of milk, food dyes, and vegetable oil. Pour a thin layer of milk onto a plate, drop dyes into milk, then pour about 1/2cup of oil into the milk & dyes in a rapid sweeping motion, just enough to stir up the colors and form bubbles.

1603 2018-05-03 20:08:08 btw i am sure this would be much better for darker brows, but mine are blonde so the color plays a big part. but the coconut oil even darkened them a lil too. for darker brows you probably wouldn’t need the pencil or anything but i prefer it to balance color!
1604 2018-05-03 20:07:55 HomeDepot called me last Wednesday and said my mower was fixed and asked if I wanted a tune up and oil change. I said sure. They said it would probably be done on Saturday.

1613 2018-05-03 20:05:54 Why does getting an oil change take like 2 years
1614 2018-05-03 20:05:53 Jeff ran a Hedge Fund before he started selling books. Do you know him from Miami, Seattle or New York? If not for fracking you would have a terrible economy in Texas. If things are so bad there in boom oil and natural gas times you live in a rough place.

1659 2018-05-03 19:59:21 But that's the point @RSPOtweets, the palm oil industry is continuing to destroy valuable habitats even under your certification.

1689 2018-05-03 19:55:42 I'm perpetually confused about why people revered Klein.  All he did was surf on the tide of oil exploration without bothering to take care of essential needs of the province.  Infrastructure, schools, hospitals, human rights, it all got ignored.

1766 2018-05-03 19:42:06 Ask people in OK about Pruitt. He worked with oil/gas industry instead of against them and now OK is a wreck. Fracking everywhere. Earthquakes. It is a mess. Pruitt needs a firing squad. Send his staff back to Tulsa.

1815 2018-05-03 19:34:55 President Liar probably dealing oil to North Korea, money laundering, prostitution and perhaps some nefarious deals
1816 2018-05-03 19:34:39 @Babbletr0n @liinxy any changes regarding oil crafting cost or PTS crafting cost?
1817 2018-05-03 19:34:37 Seems like top 5 picks are:
1. That's a really good game.
2. That's the way game chasin' go.
3. That's my playstation.
4. What's wrong with these guys.
5. Oil up and hit the gym with me.

I'm sure we'll be satisfied with any or all of these :D
1818 2018-05-03 19:34:35 Nope-but if by chance, you do find someone writing cheques, pls send them my name.

And BTW, even if billionaires are funding water & land protection, what in the world could possibly be wrong with that? There is so much information & science as to why we need to move on from oil
1819 2018-05-03 19:34:32 Muppet. He's no oil painting
1820 2018-05-03 19:34:14 The hardest part about changing your oil is remembering to put the plug back in the oil pan.
1821 2018-05-03 19:34:12 Never knew Walmart does a free vacuum when you get an oil change
1822 2018-05-03 19:34:01 LMAO. Before you said this my first thought was “well it’s my mandatory night to oil the whips at the club and if I don’t they dry out and hurt more but not in a good way”
1823 2018-05-03 19:33:53 Atleast you know that $AMZN wont enter the Nat Gas & Oil market lol...  LONG $CHK
1824 2018-05-03 19:33:45 Serena_Shim was onto a major conspiracy not conspiracy theory involving multiple nations.The US,Turkey, Syria,Iran,Saudi,Lebanon and their leaders past and current.That is what is currently known with oil,gold smuggling, currency laundering,arms dealing.Where are the "lost" files
1825 2018-05-03 19:33:44 i love this picture of u especially how with my glasses off i can't tell if it's a photo or just a fanciful oil painting from centuries ago
1826 2018-05-03 19:33:29 "I need an oil change and I dont know if I should do it today or tomorrow."

Flip a fucking coin, the fuck do I care
1827 2018-05-03 19:33:23 I put too much coconut oil on my legs and I hate it
1828 2018-05-03 19:33:23 which has more oil/gas energy money?
1829 2018-05-03 19:33:19 I find it very difficult to follow your president through all the changing versions he delivers via Twitter to nearly all matters. Shouldn't he just sit back and not commenting the ongoing investigation? His party should defend him. Instead he seems to put oil into the fire....
1830 2018-05-03 19:33:15 If he found out yesterday or 5 years ago, what changes materially? Nothing.
1831 2018-05-03 19:32:51 Got it: Saturn Devouring his Son, 1636 (oil on canvas), Rubens, Peter Paul (1577-1640) / Prado, Madrid, Spain
1832 2018-05-03 19:32:43 @school_ws taylan from rk really enjoyed the zoo today and has forever been telling me to make sure I don't buy anything with palm oil in it because it will make the rainforest creatures die and be extinct 
1833 2018-05-03 19:32:39 Cause I have all new stuff on my motor like hoses, sensors, thermostats, oil change, spark plugs, Wires. Stuff like that. But it’s shaking cause I need to buy a new tire and some other stuff and to do the trip I don’t think I’ll have the funds
1834 2018-05-03 19:32:31 not to femmesplain but you're probably better off skipping it for a while and then introducing something oil based slowly after a week or so. im so sorry, RIP fave facial moisturise..... :(
1835 2018-05-03 19:31:53 Woooo. Yeehaww! 

Oil change day!


1836 2018-05-03 19:31:24 There is no better combo in life than olive oil and balsamic HEAVEN thank u lord
1837 2018-05-03 19:31:21 The statements made at the ceremony allow making predictions about Az.n’s policy for the coming years & directions of its oil strategy, necessitating a re-assessment of the path from the Contract of the Century to the present day and allowed Azer to balance its foreign policy.
1838 2018-05-03 19:31:04 drink the weed oil
1839 2018-05-03 19:31:01 You bring the tea, I’ll bring the (palm oil free) biccies haha
1840 2018-05-03 19:30:55 The oil girl was shaking so the Size put her left arm over her back and is resting her head on her back...seems to have calmed Maggie down.
1841 2018-05-03 19:30:44 Culture and church = oil and water!!
1842 2018-05-03 19:30:42 Data is the new oil? No: Data is the new soil.� David McCandless #data #quote via @bigdataclub
1843 2018-05-03 19:30:36 So lower prices for gasoline will continue to support demand for drivers while at the same time higher diesel prices will keep refiners profitable and running. Is this not bullish for oil prices - demand remains strong while crude prices move up?

1845 2018-05-03 19:30:25 Liberals the facts are like oil and water. They don't mix! You can present them with the hardest core facts, and yet they're still in denial. That's why I laugh when they always argue present the facts!
1846 2018-05-03 19:30:25 I will literally pay twice what an oil change should cost to go to jiffy lube instead of precision auto tune just so I can be treated like a human by the mechanics who work there
1847 2018-05-03 19:30:17 If it's not tesla, it will be another company but in the end i think electrical motors will replace combustion motors. Oil wars are coming..
1848 2018-05-03 19:30:16 I need a oil change like last month smh
1849 2018-05-03 19:30:12 Oil changes. Aren't you glad you asked?
1850 2018-05-03 19:30:06 I hate going in to go get an oil change 
1851 2018-05-03 19:29:35 They would only have held on for a few more months if lucky. What is Labours excuse for 83.87 & 92 ? They were both dependent on Scottish Oil to keep them afloat. And still are.
1852 2018-05-03 19:29:34 And we are selling Europe more oil than OPEC from what I have read
1853 2018-05-03 19:29:34 Lol nah the vaseline oil.
1854 2018-05-03 19:29:13 It's scented powder that you spray on your roots/hair to absorb oil, then comb or brush it out to remove the build up of oil and refresh the scent of your hair.  Gotta say, though, I've found that stuff to be pretty pricey.
1855 2018-05-03 19:29:07 The soul I created by mistake of motor oil is the issue
1856 2018-05-03 19:29:03 But America has an intrest in Saudi pricing and selling oil in USD and stability of oil markets.
1857 2018-05-03 19:28:53 Norma tiro un "ay qué ganas de ir a echar gas oil" es una gila jaajajajajajaja
1858 2018-05-03 19:28:49 Why is our government trying to cripple our own responsible energy industry, and then importing foreign oil (with lesser environmental restrictions) when we don't have enough. Behaviour can't change. All that happens is people pay more to drive to work, or heat their homes, etc.
1859 2018-05-03 19:28:37 Lavender oil has helped me! I got mine at target in the cosmetic isle!.I would get so annoyed with people posting about their oils, than I tried it and they help so much!

1861 2018-05-03 19:28:32 i have to go get my oil changed next week but at least i can get it done while i’m at work~
1862 2018-05-03 19:28:26 @MonroMB got an oil change a few months ago I was told it would be 2hrs...7hrs later I got my car back. Went to a different Monro today I was told an hour and a half and it's now and hour and half late. Dealership is worth the extra 10 bucks.
1863 2018-05-03 19:28:26 use tea tree oil
1864 2018-05-03 19:28:26 OR anoint it with oil, say a prayer, and try to use it.

1866 2018-05-03 19:28:13 I know it's hardly the time to say this, but I've had a shave and put some beard oil on and I'm so attracted to myself right now it's unreal.
1867 2018-05-03 19:27:55 @Castrol What a AYURVEDIC Touch to advertising of castrol bike engine oil.
1868 2018-05-03 19:27:51 started a new oil painting today and I’m so excited about it
1869 2018-05-03 19:27:46 So how you going to go to lunch with my keys in your pocket...smh 2 hour oil change!!!! NTB — feeling pissed off
1870 2018-05-03 19:27:14 Farmland control is going to be as big an issue as oil, gas and water control in the near future, I’m concerned for the next generation...
1871 2018-05-03 19:27:03 2) Apply ample amounts of moisturizer like a beard oil, or other  product. Try to avoid moisturizures with alcohol in there as they  actually dry out your skin.
1872 2018-05-03 19:26:58 But as long as the Govt.'s don't lower their taxes, it will definitely hit the economy even if the international crude oil prices decrease.
1873 2018-05-03 19:26:53 Wait for the oil from Ghryan 
1874 2018-05-03 19:26:43 China as a friend should demand Transparency, curtail cronyism & Corruption. 
Pakistan faces a national security threat by its Current Account Deficits. 
Needs belt tightening. 
Increased oil prices & interest rates on horizon. 
China did not grow on consumer driven growth.
1875 2018-05-03 19:26:41 When you wear a new dress for @TopVintage And the inconsiderate tears at the next table - who are incapable of controlling their child - spill sesame oil and chilli sauce all over the skirt
1876 2018-05-03 19:26:31 There is dire need to focus on tourism sector of KSA. It would enable KSA to transform its economy from oil based to services sector. Moreover,  jobs may be announced for overseas jobseekers so that KSA would be able to get benefit from experienced foreign manpower

1880 2018-05-03 19:26:12 Can adults use baby oil?
1881 2018-05-03 19:26:09 this car is the 45 year old butch who would buy you a beer and give you relationship advice at the local lesbian dive bar, and also change your car's oil
1882 2018-05-03 19:25:55 When are we as a society going to realize we ARE slaves? We are the oil that makes this engine run. Black, white, asian, etc. people of America “we the people” dont be fooled and dont be afraid #IfSlaveryWereAChoice #FreeThinker
1883 2018-05-03 19:25:41 If we had continued the sustainable power initiatives and technological developments born out of the oil crisis in the 70's, the West would be weaned off of oil already. But that didn't sit well with the Oil barons and Corporate America! Meet the new boss same as the old boss...
1884 2018-05-03 19:25:22 Coconut oil has a mind of its own!

1888 2018-05-03 19:25:07 @benepling has forgotten our little bet on the oil empire that he was building in Aug 2016. Something about GUSH doubling in 2 years. Anyone else remember @BohleyMike @RickKaderly @StoneyE34 @Ian_Leja @ae_brown17? #needstobeat90 #onlyat31
1889 2018-05-03 19:25:03 @trydailypay You pigs have the most reprehensible “customer service” I’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting.  How dare you sell your snake oil to the masses.
1890 2018-05-03 19:24:59 Ua! And good chance the oil came in on the same flight/ship at the same shipping cost.
1891 2018-05-03 19:24:55 I forgot to put my coconut oil in the fridge and it’s like 80 degrees .....
1892 2018-05-03 19:24:51

1897 2018-05-03 19:24:19 Why so many oil spills ? A very corrosive oil ? The poor quality of the pipelines ? Whatever! This kind of infrastructure should not exist . I can't understand that a so-called world great power turn down to promote renewable energies !
1898 2018-05-03 19:24:11 Oil of Olaz 
1899 2018-05-03 19:24:09 I got 1.5m to go for Neptune, but that should take another 22k oil, so I'm gonna let my reserves go up today and take a break from grinding and have the clock tick down on another ship today.

1902 2018-05-03 19:24:01 Great, and the government must remember that the electricity that will feed these vehicles must be clean as well (no coal or oil power plants).
1903 2018-05-03 19:23:55 I bet he smells of patchouli oil.
1904 2018-05-03 19:23:50 WARNING. 
IMF & Moody's have issued warning about Economy. 
Increase in Oil or interest rates will push Pakistan into bankruptcy. 
Devalue PKR, restrict imports, travel, Haj, Prestige Projects by min $5Bill. 
Promote exports. Consumer/Credit driven growth not healthy.

1907 2018-05-03 19:23:19 And the wedding gift is oil painting on black velvet of dogs playing poker.
1908 2018-05-03 19:23:18 Agreed, hope policy makers do not increase center and state taxes,but the actual crude oil price going down is good sign for India.,isn't it ?
1909 2018-05-03 19:23:14 Simple: I sprayed it with cedar oil and slept with my door closed LMAO
Also I'm pretty sure it's a grasshopper of some kind?? The pic doesn't do it justice but it's like... 2.5 inches long

1914 2018-05-03 19:22:10 I played the oversold bounce on the initial market dump, been playing leveraged gold & oil today. Patiently waiting for this weekly equilibrium, gonna stop trading all together once it gets tighter so that I am all cash ready to trade either direction on the break.
1915 2018-05-03 19:22:02 In return for my soul, the Devil promised me pixelated bukkake, but all I got was oil.

1919 2018-05-03 19:21:18 More than the actual oil cost, it's the exorbitant taxes by both Center and State resulting in high fuel prices in India.
1920 2018-05-03 19:21:15 下ネタを言ったので今が深夜です
1921 2018-05-03 19:21:05 One of the best bosses I worked for was a woman, she commanded a room and in the oil and gas sector that is not easy at all; man or woman. She got to that position on merit & deserved it. I have to say that was with a US company and they are years ahead of the UK in that respect.

1923 2018-05-03 19:20:59 I am grateful for the free press #WorldPressFreedomDay here in Jamaica and especially where the snake oil salesman is in charge. E.g is not me name him...is him own
1924 2018-05-03 19:20:55 They also moved to Libya to capture oil and gas it’s all money and land
1925 2018-05-03 19:20:28 The AK House has begun debate on amendments to HB 331, the bill that would allow the state to issue bonds to pay off the tax credits to oil and gas companies. Amendment 1 would bar issuing bonds if it looks like the bonds would lower the state credit rating past AA-. #akleg
1926 2018-05-03 19:20:12 .@apo4nm On deadline, back 2u more later but...how much did WIPP cost, to handle waste of nuclear plants (not counted in your per kWh i don't think, nor were subsidies to build nuclear AND coal plants)?
Did you add in cost of subsidies, pollution, disease to oil, fracking, coal?
1927 2018-05-03 19:19:59 Yes very familiar with the "story" and that is all it is with no scriptural facts. The facts are I believe that the lady being stoned was never named. Mary is credited with the washing of Jesus's feet with oil and drying it with her hair. Another story is that Mary was an apostle
1928 2018-05-03 19:19:52 I bought this Jamaican black castor oil and I’ve only used it twice 
1929 2018-05-03 19:19:49 ช่วงสอบทีไรกู Burn the midnight oil 
1930 2018-05-03 19:19:41 @RobBreakenridge, just a question, apparently our gas prices are high because our refiners can export their product for higher margins, how can they achieve that but we have the inverse problem for our oil?
1931 2018-05-03 19:19:32 Iced coffee with a dash of sugar free vanilla and hazelnut syrup, stevia, and some almond milk (maybe add mct oil)
1932 2018-05-03 19:19:31 Trump is like an oil slick at the beach. Anyone walking into that water gets stained. If Rudy was part of campaign and transition I’m sure he will soon need a lawyer given his Fox statements coming across as having knowledge of all that went on at that time.
1933 2018-05-03 19:19:28 People are freaking out about $3 gas? Try $4 here in good old California. It's been hovering at high 3's for a while, and with summer coming it's the perfect time for the oil companies to toss out their favorite "disruptions in the supply chain" stories. #ridebikes
1934 2018-05-03 19:19:22 Please what statistics? Like increasing Nigeria debt profile by 80% up to N22Tr?  Like taking inflation rate from about 8% to up to 18%,  Gdp growth rate from 3.96 to -2.34 in 2years.?  Anyways any other president would have had similar results until we restructure. Forget Oil.
1935 2018-05-03 19:19:17 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
1936 2018-05-03 19:19:16 Nope! 'Non-toxic', which means it won't kill you, but you still shouldn't drink it.

Now, it has three properties of which one should be aware:

First, it is mineral oil based. This means if you drink it, it will shoot straight through you without stopping for the lights.
1937 2018-05-03 19:19:15 Coconut oil + tea tree oil saved my face 
1938 2018-05-03 19:19:11 actualy west is switching to electric so oil costs go cheap, so imports to india remain normal i guess..!!
1939 2018-05-03 19:19:06 Arabs BCion ko koi kam nai hai. Oil sy paisay bna lo or biwiyan ly ao or sheron ko kuton ki tarah ghar k bahir bandh do -_-

1947 2018-05-03 19:18:17 Why was I so late to get in the oil diffuser game?!?
1948 2018-05-03 19:18:00 Right, they force u to drive a car, live in a house u heat and cool and use plastic encased computer/phone, wear clothes made with oil based products. Take ur meds? (Oil bases capsules) whats ur carbon foptprint?
1949 2018-05-03 19:17:58 Also my mom bought a bottle of fancy olive oil on our way out. I'm sure it was overpriced but it was probably the coolest bottle of olive oil that has ever or will ever grace my parents' pantry shelf. The end.

1958 2018-05-03 19:17:04 The idea is that you skip breakfast and drink that (i ate anyway because ) and the coconut oil allows your body to store the fat from the butter that way when the afternoon groggyness comes around, your body takes from the stored energy from the fat.
1959 2018-05-03 19:17:04 Trump were not on a Level Playing Field..lol. for consumers. you're giving us artificial high gas prices because all the sanctions you put in place.. Nigeria can't even find buyers for their oil.. because it's sitting out there because of you.

1964 2018-05-03 19:16:43 I know my hay fever has been the worst ever this year think the tree pollen was late and collided with the oil seed rape. Hoping a change of pollen on my hols might sort me out!

1967 2018-05-03 19:16:17 Always thought that meant rubbing olive or coconut oil all over yer ass
1968 2018-05-03 19:15:42 Try, US exporting gas and all refineries are at capacity with rising oil prices.
1969 2018-05-03 19:15:37 @milkmakeup Can you clarify if Kush Mascara actually contains CBD oil? The description says "CBD-rich cannabis oil" but the ingredients say "Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil" which sounds to me like hemp seed oil. Is it hemp seed oil or CBD oil? Thanks!
1970 2018-05-03 19:15:31 Yeaaaa it's gonna sound nasty when you search it but it's essentially coffee, grass-fed butter and XCT  (essentially concentrated coconut oil.)  I was very hesitant but I was desperate because my brain was so foggy.  I was pleasantly surprised how it took away my need to nap.
1971 2018-05-03 19:15:29 My dad got in my car to move it so he can change my oil and the first thing he says when he gets out, “do you smoke in here everyday”  I thought the smell was gone

1978 2018-05-03 19:14:57 When the weather gets warmer my skin secretes oil excessively. So this summer I really have to be on high maintenance with my face care. In just these few days my skin has been very oily, and I am trying to keep it at bay.
1979 2018-05-03 19:14:44 You know it’s hot outside when your coconut oil is melted 
1980 2018-05-03 19:14:31 Thank you @FeelSupremeCo for the quick delivery.
My Mum uses CBD Oil to help with her illness, but after a bad fall last week she has upped her dose and it has helped alot.

1986 2018-05-03 19:12:54 Supply was a huge part of that. Much more production from the US and Canada put a lot more oil onto the market and the when Saudicincreased production in 2015 it really flooded the market
1987 2018-05-03 19:12:24 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
1988 2018-05-03 19:12:20 It is also true that the Africans themselves were involved in the trade. Up till now the same African leaders are not caring about the Africans. Why is there still poverty in the oil rich African countries?  Corruption.
1989 2018-05-03 19:12:14 Nah fuck em their fans think we are 15yr old oil cunts and their manager thinks were cheats
1990 2018-05-03 19:12:11 Why doesn't CNN find out WHY has is so high when you said the USA is the biggest producer of oil now. Saudi Arabia doesn't pay a dollar a gallon.

1996 2018-05-03 19:11:23 I leased a Leaf a few years ago.  My commute was about 60 miles round trip.  Perfect for me: charge every night, ready to go in the morning. 

BTW, there are problems with electric cars but all things equal, they are nice to drive in traffic. No gas station stops, no oil changes
1997 2018-05-03 19:11:17 I just discovered pine nut oil is a thing and I may have let out an audible gasp.
1998 2018-05-03 19:11:07 That is one scary picture, it seems a lot of our products we buy have palm oil in them, it is difficult to find products without it in #Palmoil

2000 2018-05-03 19:11:01 I’m waiting for my car to get an oil change and this little girl is farting across from me and looking me in my eyes.. disrespectful.
2001 2018-05-03 19:10:48 where do we go from "this coffee shop is selling an $80 bottle of olive oil"?? where? WHERE????
2002 2018-05-03 19:10:36 U must live in a cave, no heat/ac, no plastic products, no elect., no meds, no car, no computer/phone...oh wait...ur online! Did big oil force u to do these things? Whats ur carbon foot print?
2003 2018-05-03 19:10:29 There is no such thing as "Trade Deficit" in today's business, there is simply exchange of interests, that is :   corns, beans, beef from USA exchange for oil, steel, computers from China, simply as that.
2004 2018-05-03 19:10:29 I have a special box under the stairs... Some parallel cables were soooo well made! You could moor an oil tanker with them. Glad to not be alone. :)
2005 2018-05-03 19:10:26 Truffle oil in moderation.

2007 2018-05-03 19:10:06 it might not be a big deal to some, but today i changed my oil entirely by myself and I’m super proud.
2008 2018-05-03 19:10:03 I mean honestly is there ANYTHING peppermint, tea tree or coconut oil can’t fix???
2009 2018-05-03 19:10:02 Han:  "Sorry, Sweetheart.  I haven't got time for anything else."  C3PO:  "Thank the Maker! [This oil bath is going to feel so good!"].  Darth Vader:  "I find your lack of faith disturbing."  Chewie:  Grrrowwwr! [the last word in SWIV].

2018 2018-05-03 19:09:13 I'm at a Nissan Dealer getting an oil change and they're playing Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous by @GoodCharlotte my day has been made.
2019 2018-05-03 19:09:10 And the last time gas this expensive oil was over $100 a barrel. Now sits at $68. And refineries making record profits! Greed running wild! Not enough Canadian refineries so we get screwed by American and foreign oil thank to tory governments Giving away our oil!
2020 2018-05-03 19:09:05 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
2021 2018-05-03 19:08:57 Not just oil: Weapons, too.

Russia in Syria makes a lot more sense if you just think of it as live-fire testing/demonstration/advertising their weapons to potential buyers.

(That, plus Putin wants his pipeline).

2024 2018-05-03 19:08:05 Oh, and US response when Iran actually implemented a democratic government? Immediately overthrow it, install a dictator, start literally stealing Iranian oil, then when dictator is overthrown, use a nearby dictator (Hussein) as a proxy to kill something like a million Iranians.

2032 2018-05-03 19:06:58 Tee tree oil!! That’s what I use on all my piercings put a small amount on 2-3 times a day. It stinks tbh but it gets rid of keloids so well
2033 2018-05-03 19:06:48 1. So oil prices following the path I predicted. 2. GOI doing the sensible thing - allowing petrol/diesel prices to go up.
2034 2018-05-03 19:06:46 Haha, Russia needs that war - because of oil prices
2035 2018-05-03 19:06:43 I did get the ink off.  Baby oil was the key!
2036 2018-05-03 19:06:21 Ahaha yeah and I have some literature about how the 'management' industry is comprised of charlatans and snake oil peddlers
2037 2018-05-03 19:06:19 Meanwhile we import our oil from countries with terrible environmental standards. Saudi arabia, nigeria, azerbaijan. Our governments miss out on revenue from higher prices. We then don't have the money to fund gov green technology initiatives.
2038 2018-05-03 19:06:16 If it's proved he did know, so what, still no crime.
2039 2018-05-03 19:06:14 I heard that from a geologist whose son is an oil broker in Texas. It isn't uniform but many complaints about the oil being 90° gravity
2040 2018-05-03 19:06:13 Db both my girls wouldn’t take them. Back up crib sheets, sleep sack, extra burp cloths (I totally recommend copper pearl), car seat cover if needed (both copper pearl and little unicorn are awesome). Nipple cream or coconut oil if you are going to breastfeed.
2041 2018-05-03 19:06:13 waaaaaay too many big words to come from Trump...lol  you might sell this to his equally illiterate base, but Liberals aren't buying your snake oil.

It's a 'free market' y'all, everything is possible!
2044 2018-05-03 19:05:46 O/N Wrap:
Disappointing European data weighed on equities in that part of the world; conversely, upbeat US data failed to prevent tests of key technical support for the #DJIA; US-China trade back in focus; oil up on Iran concerns; #NZD higher, but still withing sight of 0.7000.

2049 2018-05-03 19:04:57 US needs to break ties with Saudi Arabia. We don't need their oil. We don't. We got the technology to stop using it and we have the stockpiles to see us through the transition.
2050 2018-05-03 19:04:53 Um hum.. but there's also a complacency of ignorance and apathetic "not worth my time or energy " thrown into the pot to make the Zionists, Greedy Oil Powers, and beneficiaries of defense spending have a free for all.

2058 2018-05-03 19:03:41 yeah exfoliators can be super harsh. also getting a water based moisturiser instead of an oil based one helps with breakouts, less nasty stuff to clog your pores with

 Presents an idea that is hidden to the masses

 Uses mental gymnastics to hide technical details

 Instructs or replies in parable, poetic, or metaphoric form

 Frequent use of word association chains - semantics games

2066 2018-05-03 19:03:04 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

2068 2018-05-03 19:03:00 I don't disagree! My concerns are more related to substance than to process, e.g. the figurative "snake oil" as opposed to the "salesman." No doubt, Trump is  a master salesman.
2069 2018-05-03 19:02:58 I think it’s a little early to declare victory. That’s all I’m trying to say. If opec is wants oil to rise, it will rise.
2070 2018-05-03 19:02:57 They are copying what San Diego tried to do a few years ago.  I still have my SD Beat LA giveaway shirt that I use when changing the oil in the car, painting, polishing my shoes etc.
2071 2018-05-03 19:02:48 No, I don't think they are. Global demand for oil is growing. Big oil will take it's wallet to countries where they can produce oil without a bunch of idiots standing in the way. All you are are achieving is stifling a highly regulated canadian industry.
2072 2018-05-03 19:02:45 And you're entitled to that opinion, I don't share it. It would be pretty easy tom include that important piece in the question, for @RachelNotley to mention oil tankers when she's pushing it, for @JustinTrudeau to include that. I'm not mad, I live here! You move on!
2073 2018-05-03 19:02:45 Like an oil painting
2074 2018-05-03 19:02:42 Clearly the oil company doesn't give a shit. The fines are probably cheaper than actual safety!

2088 2018-05-03 19:01:09 That’s like putting water in your oil.
2089 2018-05-03 19:01:04 It's 161 with the oil leak.
2090 2018-05-03 19:00:52 The increase in customs on cooking oil imports is condemnable. @ImranKhanPTI must protest #PMLN
2091 2018-05-03 19:00:47 these are all smart observations, but Rethuglicans will take the Reneables' money and keep their friendship with Oil, Gas & Coal. #FossilFuels need to stay in the ground. Dems need to step up their commitment to #EnvironmentalRights #EnvironmentalJustice. More than just renewable
2092 2018-05-03 19:00:46 @PaulRogersSJMN Why not follow us (and maybe #SoCalGasCoverUp)? We are the only R&D company in the world preparing to stop the next oil and gas blowout before it destroys more of the planet!
2093 2018-05-03 19:00:44 Let me guess. They have no money for anything because everything costs money and taxes are for socialists. Also oil and gas will save us until such time as it hits us.
2094 2018-05-03 19:00:33 #ignorantbho How ignorant is he?  During oil spill in the gulf, he kept threatening BP while the oil is gushing out. He did not visit the site, did not offer to help find solution n continued to play golf. He expected BP to fix it alone. When disaster happened, you help first.

2097 2018-05-03 19:00:21 The pound isn't much of an asset lately. I'd rather keep the oil. But it's a stupid argument either way.

2099 2018-05-03 19:00:19 I'm ok. Colds are a nuisance but it's ok. Tea Tree oil helps fight it. On neck glands. Keeps worst at bay. Thanks lovely. It's you were concerned about.
2100 2018-05-03 19:00:10 Check that oil! When changing oil, always be sure to use the grade that is recommended by your manufacturer. This can improve your gas mileage by 1-2%!
2101 2018-05-03 19:00:04 If the previous Govt's that sold oil at average of $100/barrel, has done half of what this current Govt is doing, we will not where we are in terms of infrastructure. Judiciary is another arm of Govt. Govt is doing well by dragging looters to the court.None of them has been freed

Rather than frying in #oil, turn up your oven to 200 Celsius (400 Fahrenheit) and roast your meat, fish, or poultry with some vegetables. Minimal oil is also used in baking, barbecuing, broiling, grilling, poaching, and steaming.

2116 2018-05-03 18:58:28 @EnergzdEconomy dr.wald, are there other factors that affect the price of oil other than demand and geopolitics? I.e derivitives markets or trading in stocks in general

2120 2018-05-03 18:58:11 I bought it so it could tell me things like .... "hello, one of your tires is f_cking low on air, take care of it" 
"omg when TF will you change the oil?" 
"Geez put your damn seatbelt on."
"Ok genius you left the trunk open."

2123 2018-05-03 18:57:46 I use heavy duty conditioner and leave it to sink in for a while. Also hair oils with Argan oil in - make it look sleek and glossy but not like sea birds are dying in it.
2124 2018-05-03 18:57:38 Even with all the money in the world, there are projects that will take upwards of 4 to 6 years to complete. Notwithstanding the current revenue being generated by govt especially as the price of oil has slumped.  Ditto with power supply.

2138 2018-05-03 18:55:33 It’s so incredibly frustrating that people think that designers should do work for free. You should be embarrassed for assuming as much. Would you dare ask a plumber to change your faucet for free? Or perhaps pull your car in and have the audacity to ask for a free oil change?
2139 2018-05-03 18:55:25 @AudiCanada need some help...my dad took his A8 TDI in, asked for a regular service to include oil change. Dealer says because he requested the oil change, the recall extended warranty won’t apply. Is this true? Other issue re intercooler came up too. Help!
2140 2018-05-03 18:55:10 so you agree,.US ,inventories will always keep on rising. It is expected to get to 500000 by the end of the year..so plenty of oil to go around for all seasons for many many years.:)

2158 2018-05-03 18:52:17 Trump increases US oil and gas production maximally so he can brag about economic growth ... wild west in oil and gas production make opportunities for huge catastrophe like Deepwater Horizon oil spill
2159 2018-05-03 18:52:14 I see they state FY expections should be met but that expectation is for a loss (also in 2019 too) - possibly higher oil prices if sustained will put the wind in their sales? Struggling to see much on first glance to like 
2160 2018-05-03 18:52:13 I know that feeling.  I did dr Xand’s Miso aubergine last night, except I didn’t have lime, sesame oil, sesame seeds and pomegranate! My husband reckoned it would taste pretty good if I actually followed a recipe. (I am a cooking disaster!)

2221 2018-05-03 18:43:36 SARAH, ADMIT YOU HAVE BEEN LIED TOO OR YOU ARE COMPLICIT IN LYING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO DEFEND THE CON MAN SELLING SNAKE OIL TO AMERICA!!!!
2222 2018-05-03 18:43:24 Don’t forget the beard oil.
2223 2018-05-03 18:43:15 Don't knock the ones in oil! They make good pizza toppings.

2225 2018-05-03 18:43:03 I gave my friend a tampon and she said “why does this tampon feel weird” and I said ... “what does it feel like ?” and she goes “mint” and I knew immediately what it was .

I KEEP TAMPONS IN THE SAME BAG AS MY PEPPERMINT OIL NOOOOOOO 
2226 2018-05-03 18:43:00 I had a colleague who used to work offshore, on oil rigs. He very quickly took away any attraction I felt about helicopter travel…
2227 2018-05-03 18:42:50 My oil change light would come on after I just got this bitch inspected and paid taxes on it.

2230 2018-05-03 18:42:43 Dear Sir,
Kindly arrange Electricity during 7pm to 10pm in villages.
As poor students will study when there is lack of Kerocine Oil.
2231 2018-05-03 18:42:26 Man, all the people these days with their synthetic 0w20 IBU are missing out on the nuanced flavour of a craft oil with 20w50 IBU
2232 2018-05-03 18:42:14 Except you are though. It says no plastic bags. 

Today they've finally decided to follow their own rules and refuse to take bins containing bags, wallpaper, mirrors, sheets of glass, paint/oil cans, pyrex, polystyrene etc. 

Simple solution...tip the bag contents in the bin.
2233 2018-05-03 18:41:58 Uh, Dude this reads like a homo-erotic novel. Getting pretty vivid describing that oil being poured on a MAN... Anyways just wanted to swing by to tell you that you are a terrible person, but it seems you have a potential future writing smut books! #papabless
2234 2018-05-03 18:41:53 I'll also need hella candles, essential oil diffuser and incense 

Add a full body mirror for selfies. @meauxhenry

2239 2018-05-03 18:41:16 US "short-lived" Growth based on unhealthy growth on things like oil, coal and gas,  at the expense of nature and tourism.
2240 2018-05-03 18:41:00 Imagine England without 92% of scots oil for 50 years!
England cant stand on its own feet,it has`nt done so for centuries,and dragging scots into brexit against our will so the oil can be kept is proof the union was never equal.
The scots will vote indy
2241 2018-05-03 18:40:50 Omg I hope so it b a cute oil baby

2244 2018-05-03 18:40:21 Sanctions hurt the VP and Pres of Venezuela. Not individual Venezuelans. PDVSA has not invested in oil production in years. Iraq a different story; that I see your POV. Venezuela is all on PSUV.

2246 2018-05-03 18:40:18 Natural ladies: what kind of products do y’all use? I use Cantu and Shea Moisture and WG oil and Softee scalp conditioner but my hair doesn’t hold moisture so I need to try other products
2247 2018-05-03 18:40:14 no more oil changes etc
2248 2018-05-03 18:39:58 It’s just nice when you done shower then you get to moisturise your skin and then oil your body. Damn the feelings 
2249 2018-05-03 18:39:38 you got it babe, heads up though - it's mostly sesame paste and palm sugar. but some homemade chili oil and fivespice-braised soy sauce helps a ton.

i'll put together a quick recipe for you feller
2250 2018-05-03 18:39:33 Yes! I used it during pregnant mixed with vitamin E oil & it worked, & I used it after too & they lightened up  I’m amazed w/ our bodies b/c we carried for 9 months & boom right back to normal (kind of) lol

2252 2018-05-03 18:38:58 Gas money ain’t enough anymore, better give me some money for an oil change too. You adding miles on my car baby.
2253 2018-05-03 18:38:57 @HonestAmish_com I use the classic beard oil and love it. But the heavy duty beard balm I tried to use twice (just to make sure) cause my skin to turn red and itchy. Is this common? I guess I can't use it.

2258 2018-05-03 18:38:32 my holy grail skincare oil is vitamin e oil, grapeseed oil, and a little bit of tea tree oil mixed together it absorbs well and nourishes the skin while also helping with acne and redness
2259 2018-05-03 18:38:21 We’ve upgraded to avocado and argan oil so my hair be smelling lovely now
2260 2018-05-03 18:38:14 Emergen-C works amazing!! I am sick right now too. Meh. I am also rubbing oregano oil on to the bottom of my feet.

2262 2018-05-03 18:37:59 Cartels and Price fixing, sorry, I mean, Dealers, Manufacturers and the Oil industry.
2263 2018-05-03 18:37:51 Perhaps Tesla should just become private and relocate to France to stay away from Tesla haters and short vultures in the States. It may have better chance to succeed and do some good to the world. In the USA, you gave GM, Ford, UAW, Oil guys, Car Dealerships who hate TSLA.
2264 2018-05-03 18:37:40 As far as I see it the only people who benefit are the people in the oil patch and those are only temporary jobs

2268 2018-05-03 18:37:17 Actually not that much, no plans for tomorrow after the end of oil.
It seems like they have plans to continue with oil for the next 60-70 years...
2269 2018-05-03 18:37:13 メンソール系は実際の効力よりも爽快感による錯覚の方が大きかったりするのかしら？私は虫刺されは専らTea Tree Oilを使っています。刺されてすぐ付けると一回で痒みがなくなります。万能消毒作用のあるもので水に数滴落としてうがいをしたり口内炎や吹出物にも付けられるので身体にも優しいものだと。

2272 2018-05-03 18:37:08 snake oil fake Christianity comes to deflect from the ethical wrongs of this admin.
2273 2018-05-03 18:36:51 I’m so in love with my man. Today he changed my oil, cleaned my car, and made sure my tank was full. I know I talk/brag about him all the time, but he’s really such a great guy. I’m such a lucky girl
2274 2018-05-03 18:36:49 I use similar coloured gloves to change engine oil and filters with. #totp
2275 2018-05-03 18:36:31 Getting my oil change  but they taking all day
2276 2018-05-03 18:36:26 yeah I agree. That is because Africa has a lot of natural resources and the native people unfortunately are not skilled enough to utilize them. I have close family friends who have lived in Africa working in oil extraction rigs
2277 2018-05-03 18:36:22 So the Sunday Post journalist and a much respected former MP say there is Oil, but the British Govt, and we all know they tell the truth, says no. Next you be denying Blair stole a third of Scots Oil fields in 1998!
2278 2018-05-03 18:36:19 You aint said nothing slick to can of oil
2279 2018-05-03 18:36:17 mmm, covered with olive oil and a little bit of garlic powder under the broiler.
2280 2018-05-03 18:36:17 They are busting two massive entrenched industries oil and ICE automobiles!!! It is really really hard to beat 100 years of entrenchment!
2281 2018-05-03 18:36:15 Hi Mark, Polish guy was calling in from Greece, let me invite You for a dinner whenever you'll be in Poland :) to pay off the webinar Time :)
2282 2018-05-03 18:36:04 I'm agreeing with @RaoulGMI a little here. Inflation is accelerating according to data. Globaly sycronized recovery is history. Europe is down. China is down. Earnings peaking and oil is trending up. Only odd thing is its up USD and Up oil. Trump nixes Iran deal = i & oil higher
2283 2018-05-03 18:35:44 Babe got a oil change and car wash 
2284 2018-05-03 18:35:36 First I couldn't find my cooking oil for breakfast, then I wear a coat and sweater in 65ish weather, and now I can't find my big eraser..... My life is falling apart. #finalsweeks
2285 2018-05-03 18:35:35 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2286 2018-05-03 18:35:34 Yeah watching videos help pass the time. Definitely go for organic though if you can. I've noticed it's a bit better than just general coconut oil.
2287 2018-05-03 18:35:31 これは違う
2288 2018-05-03 18:35:29 saving the environment is a longterm investment. pollution disrupts our profit margin and ability to gather resources for further products. relying off petroleum jelly will be unprofitable longterm as less oil will be available and alcohol in product is an unnecessary expenditure
2289 2018-05-03 18:35:16 If only having this lot could bring some of  the good things from Middle East such as oil and ..... OK just oil 
Instead we've got medieval religion that will in a few years destroy us all as will oil if you believe in climate change

2290 2018-05-03 18:35:08 I need a spa weekend or trip to Morocco before I get married  but will probably have to settle for a lavender essential oil diffuser & arabian music.

2292 2018-05-03 18:34:52 That oil took me down two days in a row 
2293 2018-05-03 18:34:36 Recuerdo que mi pronóstico de Inflación para 2018 fue de 30/35% sin crisis.

Ya no tengo un número mientras esta gente siga al mando de la economía.

DICA y cero renta variable aunque eventualmente la vean subir por el CCL

2299 2018-05-03 18:33:03 after 1 year avoiding oil as much as possible i started using oil again. u cant cook wihtout this shit. food tastes much better. cant argue with that.
2300 2018-05-03 18:32:54 You're right, one of the largest exporters of oil does nothing for the global economy. Sanctions hurt those "individuals". Look what they did to Iraq before illegally invading it. They even destroyed the electric and water supply first. Sanction killings weren't enuff for them.

2309 2018-05-03 18:32:14 Look at how the economy thrives when oil booms. In 2016, oil being down affected the economy greatly. Including the railroad which I hear is pretty big business in tularosa
2310 2018-05-03 18:32:10 Coincidence? Rudy Giuliani’s infamous client list includes Russia’s Alfa Bank, in addition to the two main participants in the Trump-Russia dossier oil deal, seller Rosneft and buyer, the Gulf Arab Emirate of Qatar’s sovereign investment fund.

2317 2018-05-03 18:31:17 @AlbertaatNoon I wonder if the numbers reflect that some contractors working in the oil&gas sector come from the East Coast u other places outside AB, therefore if they are receive EI, these costs could be associate to other provinces statistics
2318 2018-05-03 18:31:16 Correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought they were using the income, to build infrastructure for the post oil future.
2319 2018-05-03 18:31:10 If you read the articles they mention there are different Variations of Palm Plants, leaves and vines. There is red palm, which i think is different. I wish Palm Oil wasnt so heavily used, it makes me wish i stopped purchasing Oreos etc. A LOT sooner.

2371 2018-05-03 18:23:35 Means we no longer are an importer of oil, energy, we finally benefit from the huge petroleum resources in USA, something they’ve been trying to do over 40 yrs. Trump adm does in less than 12 months, not obama. Becoming an Exporter of oil in the future. There goes the debt!

2374 2018-05-03 18:22:59 I always wondered why we didn’t build a Lucas Oil/Ford Field type of facility in the first place.
2375 2018-05-03 18:22:42 No oil leaks from the engine ? The pilot didnt risk his life by ejecting ? None of the panels fell off and the tyres seem to be the right ones.
That's incredible enough for me.
2376 2018-05-03 18:22:32 I’ve been having to drive Austin’s car this week and so I got him an oil change, and it’s expensive as heck bc his car only takes the premium stuff

2385 2018-05-03 18:21:10 Went to go get a simple oil change and they showed me the color of my transmission fluid and the air filter. And wow I need a man to take care of my car for me 
2386 2018-05-03 18:21:09 The oil rich country which sends it's oil to China as payment on loans much like communist African states do. Where are the UN on the suffering of Venezuelan people because of corrupt communist politicians. Communism can rebrand itself as socialism the results remain the same.
2387 2018-05-03 18:20:54 I don't know where you live but in UK and Ireland we have Meridian and Biona sans palm oil, just nuts.

2390 2018-05-03 18:20:22 Going to  a lot more oil available for heavy machinery at this rate.
2391 2018-05-03 18:20:07 Why does oil changes take forever and 20 years smh
2392 2018-05-03 18:19:45 Really there exists no fundamental reason for this to be here. We are now building. This price only invites more US oil production. Gasoline prices nationwide are now falling. The ultra bulls had 5 months to get to 80-90. They couldn't do it, and will have to face reality soon :)
2393 2018-05-03 18:19:28 Thank you I love it!! It got a little frizzy but I’m gonna try some oil next time
2394 2018-05-03 18:19:28 Me@ myself: babe, would you Incase the Middle East so I could use the oil on my hair?
Me also @ myself: there’s perfectly usable oil in Alaska, plus bears.

2398 2018-05-03 18:19:05 Every picture tells a story.   Hope it was a clean break and not too painful now. You'll need a diet with plenty of olive oil now to avoid arthritis, but get the feeling that wont be a problem for you.

2402 2018-05-03 18:18:31 "The oil and gas man tells one of Secretary McCord’s staffers that nuclear energy is taking up too much space. (He expresses no objection to the wind and solar booths.)"

That's much more realistic than I usually expect from one of these shows...

2405 2018-05-03 18:18:17 The best strategy is to outcorrupt the oil, gas and coal companies. That's possible now that solar and wind companies control a sizable amount of cash. Banks will always be on the fossil side, that's why we need to make them obsolete through crypto and renewables..
2406 2018-05-03 18:18:10 Somehow I envision a creepy Pence walking about shirtless pouring oil on Fox news viewers saying, “Don’t worry, this is going to be heavenly. I’ll only use the tip.”

2419 2018-05-03 18:16:19 Yes this is true. But if you were to increase the demand for those products in the amount that would be required to replace palm oil we would need to source them elsewhere

2430 2018-05-03 18:14:27 Not new. In fact, it was the “liquids-rich” bridge between failing shale gas and tight oil. Anadarko oil is a rounding error in the context of American supply.
2431 2018-05-03 18:14:19 Iranian nuclear ONLY FOR THE BOMB! 

Civilian nuclear is dangerous, dirty and unnecessary for energy

because:

EuroNews:

1) oil & gas reserves in Iran among the most important of the world

2) with 300 days of sun/year, the country is one of places dreamed for the solar energy
2432 2018-05-03 18:14:03 There is no surprise. I look forward to other technologies. People seem to forget that lithium mining is very dirty and at best becomes the new oil businesses with the same problem.
2433 2018-05-03 18:14:01 Someone at work said that I am the “epitome of a hipster” and that I “belong in an art house, not in oil & gas”.

2458 2018-05-03 18:11:15 US oil future is  a bet on continued external capital supply. The mainstream narrative of American exceptionalism that you recite is a palliative that ignores the reality that tight oil is a marginal business at best. Not a criticism, just a fact.
2459 2018-05-03 18:11:07 When I first moved to California I  would go to parties and they’d make me talk so they could laugh  They’d make me say “I need some oil... Go to hell... where’s the ice”  Oil to me was “Ol” and Ice was “ass” ha ha

2468 2018-05-03 18:10:07 You don't have a time machine-we spent the oil money and decided to have a low tax regime economy. Hindsight is 20/20. Nothing here supports your case for Indy, especially now we've heard SNP want ALL future oil revenue to support inter generational projects...
2469 2018-05-03 18:10:00 Pruitt was put there to work for big oil, not America. On that basis what is there to fear.

Hows it ?
2479 2018-05-03 18:08:52 Cod liver oil is a great source of pre-formed vitamin A. If you don't like the taste of fish oil, try Carlson's lemon-flavored CLO. It much more palatable than the plain variety.

2483 2018-05-03 18:08:07 The greed and self interest we are experiencing now is something I have not seen since TR broke up the big oil companies. We will be forced to fight that battle again.
2484 2018-05-03 18:07:59 And oil. Don't forget the burden of oil.
2485 2018-05-03 18:07:50 Tried coconut oil but best shop one for me is Clinique take the day off, warm water & facecloth.

2487 2018-05-03 18:07:34 I'm also much more worried about lower-compensation workers. I worry that the policy levers that improve things for the middle/high-earners can easily make things worse for the "cheap oil" folks. Thorny problem :/

Getting on that first run in the career ladder is soooo important
2488 2018-05-03 18:07:12 @SenCoryGardner the Bureau of Land Management is planning to auction off 11 parcels of land located within 1 mile of the Great Sand Dunes National Park for oil and gas drilling.

2492 2018-05-03 18:06:32 A huge disadvantage of being single: there’s no one to spread coconut oil all over the spots of your body that are hard to reach. 
2493 2018-05-03 18:06:29 @chaplinez70  It is a form market startegy. Give to your audience what they want, else you aint gonna be in the game. But this comes with moral decadence. Similar to the environmental pollution that is associated with oil drilling. For me, i blame the audience more.
2494 2018-05-03 18:06:11 I usually don't. I met these guys during a rally from Rotterdam to Rome using used frying oil as fuel. Up until a few years ago I'd discover most new stuff during festivals, but I'm now a single mom with a 5-year-old :) So I'm waiting for him to get old enough to get into pop ;)
2495 2018-05-03 18:06:04 Well, he googled what drugs to give a death row person. Turned out awful. He had oil & gas write policy for him so he could sue epa.
2496 2018-05-03 18:05:56 NO IT DEFIES ALL I KNOW ABOUT PAINTING. OIL AND ACRYLIC KNOWLEDGE AND ALL ART CLASSES COULDN'T POSSIBLY PREPARE ME FOR THESE TECHNIQUES LMAO. ITS BEAUTIFUL I LOVE IT. THE BEST PAINTING CHALLENGE IN RECENT MEMORY I'LL HAVE TOU KNOW!
2497 2018-05-03 18:05:42 Largely, I have been unimpressed with our experience at Lucas Oil.  I’m hoping things get ironed out.  We’ll see.

2504 2018-05-03 18:05:00 OPEC and its greedy allies move oil between 67-68 1000 times before breaking out of this range.  #oott
2505 2018-05-03 18:04:54 Difference with “the monster” when the oil got him, his NHL career was done. Only played 7 games with the oil. Mikko is 3” taller and only got 4 NHL games with NYI, who were in 2nd last place in the east by 1pt over last place. Think positive bud.

2516 2018-05-03 18:03:22 That’s what most Canadians are praying for. Your leader is screwing up trade so bad China is buying soya beans from another country.   Canada will do the same and start selling soft wood lumber and oil to China for more money.
2517 2018-05-03 18:03:15 A pipeline is safer than shipping the oil by rail. If I’m reading your profile right, you don’t even live in Canada. Why r u trying to endanger our ecology and stall our economy? Do you think Canadians haven’t thought of the risk/reward and what’s best for the nation as a whole?
2518 2018-05-03 18:03:15 If you got a car that’s 2005 and under its best to use oil 10W-30 and under because anything higher is too heavy and can mess up the oil pump.  I’m a mechanic  you’re welcome.

2530 2018-05-03 18:01:25 The Previous government had ministers.of.petroleum and finance for  6 years 3 of which oil prices and earnings were decent. No book will suddenly wish that away while the other can't leave the UK. Yet it's slow minister appointments we are moaning about now.

2541 2018-05-03 18:00:36 Ok guys. I think over the next few weeks I'm going to try some CBD oil. Should I use a sublingual tincture or concentrate, a capsule, a spray or vape? This is to treat anxiety. Vote, RT, and let me know what your experiences are with these products, plz and thank u.

2546 2018-05-03 18:00:10 Ever wondered how the other half lives? Over 50 percent of U.S. homes are heated using natural gas, with electric heat coming in second at about 30 percent. Fuel oil is used in 7 percent of us households, and other technologies like solar and geothermal account for 9 percent.

2551 2018-05-03 17:58:52 They will never go completely crispy as they are veggies. But use minimum oil (i used coconut oil), bake slowly (20-35min) & most importantly: season AFTER baking as salt makes them soak up oil and makes them soggy
2552 2018-05-03 17:58:37 Sauteed in butter with salt & pepper. Touch of olive oil & garlic with salt & pepper. Two of my favorite ways. The 2nd one I will add other veggies.
2553 2018-05-03 17:58:34 Interesting. Seen many times and always said "no, it's clearly oil. Really, it's not oil... no, I've no idea what it is either."
2554 2018-05-03 17:58:20 The problem is that Trudeau is among the 24% who oppose the pipeline and he doesn't care about what's good for the country or what the majority of Canadians want.

Trudeau needs to be voted out of office, if you want the Canadian oil & gas sector to thrive.
2555 2018-05-03 17:58:15 The way people cape for Jason Witten you’d think he changed all of their oil in the offseason

2560 2018-05-03 17:57:37 I recall hearing about an oil crisis, in the 70's, I was alive, but too young to absorb its meaning. Too few believe it's possible to happen again. Many mitigations built into the minds of consumers - alt-energy, EV's, US shale.  All amazing developments, but far from enough.
2561 2018-05-03 17:57:24 Need to invest in some jack stands so i can do my own oil changes from now on. Lmao
2562 2018-05-03 17:57:20 Depends. Drone would be cool but mildly useful. I’d pick 1,000 gallons of fuel or a couple 55s of oil all day. Seed or truck rental seems a little too nebulous for my tastes.

2582 2018-05-03 17:55:05 Any kind of essential oil based balm for the face should do. Or after washing your face while your skin is still damp, put your palm over the top of a bottle of olive oil and quickly tip up and back. Rub oil between your palms and massage into your skin an hour before bed.

2597 2018-05-03 17:53:43 The whole discussion is ridiculous. People against TM think they will stop oilsands production. All they are doing is changing oil transport to train from pipeline. SMH

2) with 300 days of sun/year, the country is one of places dreamed for the solar energy

2607 2018-05-03 17:52:24 Nawabshah thermometer station is sited near a truck stop & several oil companies.

2620 2018-05-03 17:51:01 Looks like a starch clump. Not pretty, but harmless! They're a result of the sugars in the potatoes that are released during the frying process. Over time they collect in the oil, stick together & form clumps. We inspect for these but this one missed inspection. I'm sorry!

But we also know the transition from oil is barely underway, and will take decades, and in the meantime people still want it, and it’s going to get sold and moved. Pick How It’ll Move.
2622 2018-05-03 17:50:52 Totally agree. Tell all the young kids to stay out of Oil&Gas. Solar is where the great engineering minds are needed.

2650 2018-05-03 17:46:55 Conservative party, 41 yrs in power, vilifying the idea of a sales tax that AB needs and everyone else has, relying on oil revenues to plug the gap.

Global oil prices fell, as they do, and the plug disappeared. Result: a huge deficit, and political fear of sales tax. 
2651 2018-05-03 17:46:55 Claro! Só pode ser a imperialista Shell Oil Company! Deve ter também o dedo da Apple Inc., com seu ardiloso plano de infiltrar iPhones entre esquerdistas. McDonald's, claro, sempre suspeito... Faça-nos o favor! E, mais uma coisa, usa-se espaço após sinais de pontuação, OK?

2665 2018-05-03 17:45:40 True, we constantly look back when things go south, instead of looking to the future and getting it right, that guy squandered how many years of oil bounty , Buhari just finished the job he started

2688 2018-05-03 17:42:31 Recommended to me by a make up expert - coconut oil, wiped off with a cloth. It gets everything off & is cheap as chips.
2689 2018-05-03 17:42:29 Asparagus! Love it roasted with some olive oil, salt & pepper 
2690 2018-05-03 17:42:28 Before bed, we usually recommend applying Beard Oil or Utility Balm (a little less than what you would use in the morning). That'll make sure your beard doesn't dry out while you sleep.

2706 2018-05-03 17:40:15 Only Problem: nobody is surprised/cares. GOP is cool with cheating, lying, insulting, bragging, groping as long as they get to cut taxes for the rich and drill for oil in nature reserves. They don't give a sh*t for any value. #gopNow
2707 2018-05-03 17:40:02 Was inhaling a pork bun when oil dropped all over my silk skirt and now I’m full and ashamed but the fit is still cute

2711 2018-05-03 17:39:58 Just stick a teaspoon of butter in your cup and pour over hot coffee - stir until melted. You should really have brain octane oil in there too but it’s not really required. I add a bit of almond milk.

2723 2018-05-03 17:38:23 Would you say the Strong Arm of America has had any negative effect on your country via oil manipulation?  Apparently your eating Rats, but I can help but to think the manipulation by outside influences (an of course with those on the inside in Venezuela) assisted in the dwnfall?
2724 2018-05-03 17:38:14 Can't wait to lather myself in oil after my bath - i am deserving.

2741 2018-05-03 17:35:59 That's why it is facile to draw a direct causal link between 1973 oil shock and rise of neoliberalism a few years later. The ideology promoted by Mont Pelerin types shaped how policymakers decided to respond to oil shock, growth slowdown

2746 2018-05-03 17:35:40 Life firsts: just bled my boiler after we ran out of oil and the pump was full of air. Earned serious manly points.
2747 2018-05-03 17:35:36 Why do I hate going & getting my car serviced so much? I act like it’s the end of the world when it’s time to get my oil changed.
2748 2018-05-03 17:35:34 They should all be investigated for their corrupt connection to Trump- coal and oil contracts, Russia, racism, fracking etc...Maybe these jerks were the secret reps behind drawing impeachment papers against Rod Rosenstein.
2749 2018-05-03 17:35:22 I suspect if you looked at @gmbutts Linked In contacts, you would find Damian Gillis. More spin trying to woo American support against the pipeline while Americans buy discount oil.

2757 2018-05-03 17:34:20 I have worked for 2 types of organisations in my life. Oil & Public Sector. Oil is ruthless, efficient, well paid, methodical & ultra competitive. Public sector is slow, can't make a decision, bound by being nice to everyone, can't manage finances. Everton are like public Sector
2758 2018-05-03 17:34:10 Has nothing to do with the price of oil...  nothing at all!!!

2761 2018-05-03 17:33:53 Counterpoint: Cars are freedom, engines make cool noises, gasoline and oil smell good, going fast rules, and I write for a right-wing opinion magazine nobody reads because I have no discernible real-world skills. Have fun eating kale on the bus, commie
2762 2018-05-03 17:33:47 Months ago I tossed out a small vial of tea tree oil assuming I wouldn't need it but here I am months later, desperately rifling through my drawers for tea tree oil. If only I could have seen into the future...well, look at me now!! Look at the FOOL now!!
2763 2018-05-03 17:33:42 That Jodi insists on calling the oil sands Tar Sands tells me all I need to know, just another holier than thou climate change huckster.
2764 2018-05-03 17:33:08 i need an oil change 
2765 2018-05-03 17:32:47 Coco oil bbe x
2766 2018-05-03 17:32:42 NO!  but we all put eucalyptus oil in our masks.  much better.
2767 2018-05-03 17:32:19 Jupiter is like an experimental celestial oil painting. Amazing.
2768 2018-05-03 17:31:52 Join the oil and vinegar club
2769 2018-05-03 17:31:39 Not to mention 3x the yield of other vegetable oil crops. So if we stopped using it we would need to now clear 3x the land to replace it.
2770 2018-05-03 17:31:18 Unfortunately, yes. It's detrimental to their health and can kill them if exposed to the t.t oil over a long period of time. Even having it in a diffuser for the house hurts them.  t.t oil is great for your skin tho, try it out.
2771 2018-05-03 17:31:12 Exactly. I’m no expert and was actually made aware of the other side of the palm oil story by @lilveggiez but it seems like the crop is great but some of the methods used to make space for it were not.
2772 2018-05-03 17:31:04 As we say in the United State Army, "The lamp of friendship always bones with the oil of love."
2773 2018-05-03 17:30:58 Trump is only using religion to turn Nigeria into another Iraq. Just as former US President Bush used Sunni-Shiite dichotomy to destroy Iraq just to lay his hands on Iraq’s oil field Trump also eyeing Nigerias oil His plan is to use ChristianMuslim divide to set Nigeria ablaze.
2774 2018-05-03 17:30:46 Whip together 9 oz caviar with 8 oz bamboo shoots. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with love.
2775 2018-05-03 17:30:39 You import literally billions of barrells of oil a year, your president cant even hire a competent lawyer and your largest rival owns the majority of your foreign debt. Making america a joke again.
2776 2018-05-03 17:30:35 So first they spill the oil & THEN they find a clean-up plan?

2781 2018-05-03 17:30:23 Stauffer hinted at his top ranked PP I believe. I took that as tea leaves the oil may be looking at him as an assistant coach in YEG taking over PP from woodcroft. Would align with a Yawney hiring as well
2782 2018-05-03 17:30:20 Time for a magnesium soak bath with healing high vibrational level music & my handmade essential oil blends 
2783 2018-05-03 17:30:20 Fun fact - As much as I disliked Stephen Harper, in 2012 he asked why gas prices were so expensive and if he needed to tax oil companies more. Gas dropped the next day. So..... Let's make something happen?
2784 2018-05-03 17:30:15 My dad just called me at work to tell me that he found a giant container or coconut oil at Costco. He truly is the only man I'll ever love 
2785 2018-05-03 17:29:54 Used to remember when Nigeria claimed be the giant of Africa now all we have is crude oil and wizkid.
2786 2018-05-03 17:29:37 Coconut oil lotion is honestly the best
2787 2018-05-03 17:29:36 Get your Almond Oil rest ladiesss
2788 2018-05-03 17:29:31 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
2789 2018-05-03 17:29:13 And oil.......a right pain that is.
2790 2018-05-03 17:29:12 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)
2791 2018-05-03 17:29:04 Environmental extremist oil producing country. Diversity is our paralysis?
2792 2018-05-03 17:28:58 My president and yourself can be good leaders of this continent African and warn the mazungus from stealing our Africa resources example oil, gold,sulphur,diamond etc
2793 2018-05-03 17:28:57 I have now been waiting for my oil change for almost an hour and a half. Just a basic oil change. What. The. Fuck.
2794 2018-05-03 17:28:51 Oil amongst other things, what do you think they have?
2795 2018-05-03 17:28:42 Crude Oil prints fresh session high at 68.41. #forex #CRUDEOIL
2796 2018-05-03 17:28:31 This doesn't seem like a smart , long-term decision though. Eventually we're going to hit peak oil and bigger vehicles are going to be useless. Unless they make these vehicles with newer technologies and engines, like electric, propane and or even fuel cell. #FutureProof
2797 2018-05-03 17:28:28 Exactly & those in our Congress & Senate used tax payer $ to "fix??" their "bad" behavior at least POTUS used his own money to pay for his attorney's retainer & his own $ to paid Stormy Daniels. @HouseGOP
2798 2018-05-03 17:28:27 After North Korean misslte tests. The U.S. stopped sending oil shipments to the North which angered the Kim Dynasty. They announced that they would reopen their nuclear program since the U.S. had failed to hold up their end of the agreement. #wow
2799 2018-05-03 17:28:20 During the time of peak oil prices, some of the Asian countries were paying for oil through their noses. Venezeula at that time was subsidizing the oil prices for it's people through the bumper income from oil exports such that it cost only RS. 2 per litre vs 60 /litre in India.
2800 2018-05-03 17:28:15 Getting my oil changed :c I'm so terribly bored.
2801 2018-05-03 17:28:07 US weapons aim at children in Palestine and Yemen.  Israel was armed by the US to keep a finger on the pulse of oil from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Now SA & China invest in Arctic shipping of Russian (Yamal1&2) LNG while US military blocks Qatar&Iran from selling #oilandgas to China.
2802 2018-05-03 17:27:35 Like I said it is no where near what oil brings in.  I know oil will be with us for a very long time.  As for your stats....I'm asking for a source....not your numbers.
2803 2018-05-03 17:27:30 Oil prices in any free economy will fluctuate, but the sheer level of oil wealth off Scotland which has been squandered will astonish future generations. New fields have found off Orkney and there are untapped fields off the West coast
2804 2018-05-03 17:27:26 ฝันดีนะคะ @iam_Oil
2805 2018-05-03 17:27:14 Omg wtf! This is so cooool!! I like it bro... 
Keep em comin'!
2806 2018-05-03 17:27:01 I swear coconut oil is my life. Dry skin? coconut oil. Dry hair? Coconut oil. Tired looking under eyes? Coconut oil. Need to cook food? Coconut oil. Need to take makeup off? Coconut oil.
2807 2018-05-03 17:26:45 We heard the same on oil which was somewhere around 100+(petrol). It dropped to around 79/lr then took a climbing lane up to now.
2808 2018-05-03 17:26:44 Gotta get that cbd oil babe!
2809 2018-05-03 17:26:43 Note to dog owners: Refusing a prong collar that your dog trainer recommended is not like refusing a synthetic oil upgrade in your old car.  When you hire us to solve problems, be open to new ideas. #dogs #dogsoftwitter
2810 2018-05-03 17:26:34 It’s only my second day on this fish oil and I’m already sleeping better and don’t feel tired lol
2811 2018-05-03 17:26:31 $mmex oil refinery in the Permian.
2812 2018-05-03 17:26:23 Also note: Anything that thwarts US Domestic Oil/NG production would be seen as *good* by Putin &co.
2813 2018-05-03 17:26:22 No natural resources perhaps but Singaporean oil refineries have a refining capacity of 1.5+ million barrels a day of crude oil
2814 2018-05-03 17:26:20 My highlight is poppin' except that's not highlight that's efficascent oil yolo
2815 2018-05-03 17:26:14 Coconut oil treatment on my teeth because I drink too much tea
2816 2018-05-03 17:26:09 I'm stealing a thought I just saw on FB.  Instead of an oil pipeline Canada should invest in a water pipeline for the almost 100 reserves without access to clean water.  Posted by Rachel Halpin
2817 2018-05-03 17:26:07 Does the same rule apply to the head coach?
2818 2018-05-03 17:25:52 the #1 thing the judges hate on chopped is anything with truffle oil or taste in it.
2819 2018-05-03 17:25:48 #CBD oil is for real! Been taking it sublingually for about 2 weeks. It has cured my #digestive issues (#bloating, #acid #reflux, painful gas), got me off of Prilosec and my #anxiety meds. Blasted beureaucrats need to take their regulations off this wonderful plant! #cannabis
2820 2018-05-03 17:25:42 Cada época tiene sus propios doomsdays, Malthus pensó en el fin del alimento, otros después sostienen eso con los metales, luego los del peak oil, luego los del "fin del Internet rápido" y así, todos equivocados.
2821 2018-05-03 17:25:28 Kurdistan isn't a sovereign country 2 trade oil. Isreal only buys Kurdish oil from US majors in Ukraine transported via Turkey. It can never build a pipeline as d countries in between don't  hv diplomatic ties with Isreal. Pl. sell these fake stories in Cow Belt. 
2822 2018-05-03 17:25:07 Hugo theew away a brand new peanut butter jar because it was “bad”....it was natural/organic so the oil was at the top still.  #paisa
2823 2018-05-03 17:25:02 I just tagged you but @jackieaina  said the same thing at first and then used their oil in a 2nd video and it was a game changer. Looked sooo good.

2826 2018-05-03 17:24:36 There has always been, and there will always be, a market for snake oil. Sometimes only the “mark” is hurt. Sometimes many, many more.
2827 2018-05-03 17:24:35 Theres a Snap vapor oil?
2828 2018-05-03 17:24:26 Need an oil change.  my pockets!

2830 2018-05-03 17:24:02 With the millionaire tax hand out and the billions of dollars of corporate welfare the Republicans and that #lying ass #Fraud @realDonaldTrump passed out like candy and making poor people like me pay for it why are the oil companies raising gas prices no shortage just criminal
2831 2018-05-03 17:24:01 The fact that Russia sidin on minerals , oil , gas , gold , diamonds says that Russia is a rich country . And the fact that the West is pulling hands to the wealth of Russia and its allies speaks about the state of the West and its economy.
2832 2018-05-03 17:23:47 （スワローならスバメとかじゃないかなあ……）
2833 2018-05-03 17:23:47 Yeah we should easily be using enough renewables that we shouldn’t have to deal with the price going above 3 dollars. We have reserved of oil for years and years so we should never ever have to deal with the price hikes of gas again or so I thought
2834 2018-05-03 17:23:45 Thank you Spotify for my very entertaining journey, Mark Knoffler 'going home': Guns amd Roses twice then the Three Tenors followed by Slipknot, Darly Braithwaite, Midnight Oil and Il Divo and on and on the roller coaster went!!!  blew the cobwebs out!!! 
2835 2018-05-03 17:23:42 Maybe the bots went for an oil refill
2836 2018-05-03 17:23:34 I was definitely thinking of green beans. Quick blanch, then sauteed in some olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
2837 2018-05-03 17:23:20 Been toking this oil. I’ve never felt so stupid in my life. This shit is the strongest stuff as far as mind dumbing. No bueno when trying to work. Fuck me
2838 2018-05-03 17:23:13 Well, it's a good word, for sure, but why not use terminology that trump's "base" might understand. Such as oily-tongued devil. Snake oil salesman.  Like, Schlapp is oil scum on the swamp....he floats and spreads and no matter how pretty the rainbow, he is toxic.

2840 2018-05-03 17:23:08 Norway demonstrates how to make the best use out of its oil reserves unlike the ‘socialist paradise’ of Venezuela with the largest reserves in the world.
2841 2018-05-03 17:23:00 So I’m waiting for an oil change in the lounge with a few people at the Toyota dealership. The receptionist comes in to inform “Bill” that his car is finished. Why did like 4 people stand up all with the name Bill
2842 2018-05-03 17:22:47 I am so excited 
I can't wait for the Pet CBD oil and CB dog treats to arrive. 
I just ordered them tonight for my dog, Meg. She is 12 1/2 years old. 
Meg has developed several fatty tumors and at times has hip problems. 
I read this testimonial and thought about my dog, Meg
2843 2018-05-03 17:22:32 Places I feel uncomfortable in ranked. 
1. Any oil change place
2. Post office
3. Gas station bathrooms.
2844 2018-05-03 17:22:32 Water will soon be the new oil.  Neither is a renewable resource.
2845 2018-05-03 17:22:19 それはごめん
2846 2018-05-03 17:22:18 Pake oil untuk rambut (kalo aku pake hair oil oriflame) + rajin sisiran:) usahakan pakai conditioner rejois:)
2847 2018-05-03 17:22:10 Am I to believe that you think fish oil was being extracted from live fish?
2848 2018-05-03 17:22:10 they washed my car, cleaned the inside, and did an oil change all for free wow

2851 2018-05-03 17:21:56 It just seems like nothing ever came of it! I don’t pay close attention to local politics but I remember a reporter in Tulsa was looking into his coziness with oil companies… Obviously I’m fuzzy on the details LOL
2852 2018-05-03 17:21:45 Throw the keys at the truck, them bees own it now. Note is due on the 5th, oil change is coming up soon, peace out 
2853 2018-05-03 17:21:43 Honestly, we should be using all renewable energy and shit by now, which would save so much money, but oil rules all I guess.
2854 2018-05-03 17:21:38 Iya ini dulunya oil wkwk
2855 2018-05-03 17:21:38 Vegetable oil!
2856 2018-05-03 17:21:37 Ive been at pep boys for 2 hours for an oil change and boy let me tell you I am fucking bored.
2857 2018-05-03 17:21:36 WARNING. 
IMF & Moody's have issued warning about Economy. 
Increase in Oil or interest rates will push Pakistan into bankruptcy. 
Devalue PKR, restrict imports, travel, Haj, Prestige Projects by min $5Bill. 
Promote exports. Consumer/Credit driven growth not healthy.
2858 2018-05-03 17:21:34 My mom hates when I do oil pulling. Perhaps because she hates the taste and that she grew up in her home country making it along with other coconut things. #coconutoil
2859 2018-05-03 17:21:23 My hair is up (full of dirt I’m sure), hands covered in oil and mud, old work shoes on, and I just ripped a giant hole in the front of my shirt. LET ME ALSO MENTION that I have a doctors appointment at a fancy ass place as soon as I leave work.
2860 2018-05-03 17:21:17 Not Chatham House, it's usually straight presentation then audience questions usually bunched together allowing presenter to place emphasis where he chooses. Hardtalk can. Or worse, Jeremy Paxman's NewsNight was The Grand Inquisition, even snake oil salesman Blair would squirm!
2861 2018-05-03 17:21:14 Yes, it is still early but it looks as though this Atlanta Braves squad is ready for prime time...a season or two ahead of schedule.

2876 2018-05-03 17:19:27 First day of shooting at a Studio, I accidentally drove a 4x4 over a pallet of oil and glue canisters that exploded and went all over the studio wall. Caused an environmental catastrophe. The glue stains are still on the studio wall.
2877 2018-05-03 17:19:19 Pulled into lube stop to get my oil changed and they broke my car!!!
2878 2018-05-03 17:19:18 Supercomputers are being used by oil and natural gas companies to find previously hidden crude oil fields.  Talk about a recipe for success!
2879 2018-05-03 17:19:16 Ya, the oil companies will keep that tax....
2880 2018-05-03 17:19:10 Hope you don't want to buy gas or oil products, or you aren't a farmer who grows or uses soybeans. Good old Lyin Ryan doesn't see that he cherry picks what he wants you to see.

2882 2018-05-03 17:19:04 You are right, nothing is safe. 

For $STMP.V  - Nothing much has changed (fundamentally) - They still have 182 Mb of recoverable oil. 

Only thing that changed is Mr. Khan leaving and then selling his investments.

I am tempted to initiate the position at these prices.  
2883 2018-05-03 17:19:04 Cheers!
2884 2018-05-03 17:19:03 Agendas of rich states acquiescent 2 will of oil, coal dynasties.

2896 2018-05-03 17:17:50 In the Masters program, there was an Indian girl that OTHER INDIANS refused to sit next to because of her smell.

2899 2018-05-03 17:17:14 No kidding.  I substituted orange juice for the olive oil, anchovies for the chicken, and left out the cheese.  It was awful, this recipe sucks.

2905 2018-05-03 17:16:32 Borneo, where I lived for a year. One island among the 17,000 of Indonesia, where islands of intact rainforest (brimming with wildlife) are surrounded by oceans of oil palm.
2906 2018-05-03 17:16:12 So the @AsoRock wont be renewing the expired licenses of some oil blocks!! I see, that explains a lot of things and recent happenings. Hmm

2917 2018-05-03 17:15:07 I really need some strong CBD oil in my life
2918 2018-05-03 17:15:04 Maybe I didn’t make my point well enough.  That’s my fault.  I refer more to trade being cut, as trade falls it stands to reason that so do living standards (such is the Brexit fearmongering).  So in a desperate situation, oil drilling permits are sold to the US on the cheap.
2919 2018-05-03 17:15:04 5 variables that could determine the direction of the local stock market:

1. Crude oil prices
2. The ringgit
3. External uncertainties; trade wars, geopolitical tensions & global interest rate
4. Corporate earnings
5. Stock valuations
2920 2018-05-03 17:14:51 So I’ll be in FL for a week next month. Every time I go, I wake up every morning and draw the sunrise and also the sunset. I use chalk and oil pastels. Would anyone be interested in buying my artwork or do y’all just want nudes?

2943 2018-05-03 17:11:39  Crazy idea:
If  didn't rely on oil, there's no reason to bomb the Mid-East.
If there's no bombing Mid-East, there's no reason to become radicalized terrorists.
If there's no terrorism, there's no reason to spend billions on weapons/war & we'd have $ to take care of . 
2944 2018-05-03 17:11:35 @IcelandFoods are utter legends 4 not only phasing out Palm oil in products from stores by the end of 2018 but leading the no plastic revolution by commiting to remove the plastic microwave trays,You should be proud and shout out about this far louder than you do!
2945 2018-05-03 17:11:29 Yep!  No oil derricks there!
2946 2018-05-03 17:11:26 Garrett, I would like to apologize for my tardiness in refollowing you.  Unfortunately, the oil goes to the squeaky wheel, which in this case is Sam's constantly changing handle.
2947 2018-05-03 17:11:26 By getting stuck on coal and oil, we could fall behind other countries that are developing other sources of power. By pulling us from the Paris Agreement, he’s taking away an opportunity to lead. So it isn’t immediate but there is potential for long term consequences

2955 2018-05-03 17:10:50 .@AMartinezLA Oil companies are leaving CA oil alone not because they "can't get to it." It's because it'd be too expensive to do so. If oil were $150, there'd be rigs all over SoCal. To keep it in the ground, we must ensure oil stays (relatively) cheap. But it's rising again ...
2956 2018-05-03 17:10:48 @Nestle just seen heartbreaking pictures on Twitter of total forest devastation so that palm oil can be planted for use in your products. What do you say? No chocolate bar is worth destroying the planet for.

3069 2018-05-03 16:58:23 Selv om at det nye navnet på Statoil er direkte tåpelig, så har vi i vår moderne tid forstått at ordet "oil" er ganske stigmatiserende. 
De fleste store oljebolag bruker ikke ordet "oil". 
Dette til deres alles orientering.

3070 2018-05-03 16:57:56 OFI advocates for a total boycott of all #palmoil, including "sustainable." The existing "sustainable" certifications do an inadequate job of enforcing their own own standards to ensure that palm oil production is done in a manner that is #sustainable and socially responsible.

That’s the part most naysayers miss— solar/wind offer a clean green abundant energy future. Plus we de-fund oil dictators and terrorists and become truly energy secure. 

I could never afford AC until... I got solar. Cool huh.

"And the bottles of massage oil?"

"Check the artwork for the new bathhouse level."

"Oh god..."
3087 2018-05-03 16:56:16 i don’t think olive oil is useful to fry with lol that shit will evaporate
3088 2018-05-03 16:56:15 Stop your so-called responsible sourcing and STOP USING PALM OIL NOW! You're destroying 1000's of HA of rainforest. Greedy. Selfish. Immoral. It's purely for profit.
3089 2018-05-03 16:56:10 I think someone needs a rundown. (Grabs the oil.)

3097 2018-05-03 16:55:39 consider having blood work done and testing different supplements. vit D and good fish oil are top tier, and I've heard zinc and magnesium are good too (tho haven't tried myself). I've heard lithium helps you sleep better but /shrug didn't seem to do much for me.
3098 2018-05-03 16:55:32 The only attacks are yours from the Left. He’s gotten the Koreas to talk peace. The economy is booming. Regulations have been cut. Less dependence on foreign oil. Intl law being enforced. THAT is a country worth living in. You have #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
3099 2018-05-03 16:55:21 My mom used to try to get me to eat liver.  After learning what the liver actually does- why would anyone eat liver?  Why would I want to eat a cow's oil filter?  Cows only eat grass- what the hell was Hannibal Lecter thinking?
3100 2018-05-03 16:54:47 Dirt bag BIG OIL FAKE NEWS
3101 2018-05-03 16:54:45 Yeah it surged recently cause of increased oil prices
3102 2018-05-03 16:54:39 So your point is a couple of minutes on the single most important thing to all the citizens of world.  And 23 hours 56 minutes on a porn star and a snake oil salesmen is a good mix??  #dim

3107 2018-05-03 16:54:00 It was the begginnings of globalization, export of manufacturing and move towards a more service orientated economy.Dollar liquidity was also needed as part of the growing US world empire, for overseas trade, purchase of Saudi oil to keep the economy running, Etc
3108 2018-05-03 16:53:57 It’s two conversations. The way deforestation has occurred for palm oil is terrible and palm oil needs to be grown differently. But since it has a higher yield than other vegetable oil crops even more land would need to be cleared to grow alternatives.
3109 2018-05-03 16:53:54 That surprises me too... But then I remembered that there ARE several oil wells in central and southern Illinois, like around Decatur. :o
3110 2018-05-03 16:53:51 I support oil pipelines. I am a homeowner that will be affected. I do not support Kinder Morgan. We get no compensation.
3111 2018-05-03 16:53:45 JAZZI AND I WERE TALkING ABOUT CBD OIL AND SHE JUST GOT A TEXT FOR IT SUDDENLY DESPITE NEVER HAVING ANY
3112 2018-05-03 16:53:45 Two Hercules transport aircraft just flew over. No civilian transponders, so I can't track them on flight radar. Did WW3 start without anybody telling me or were they just getting an oil change and new tyres and left without paying?
3113 2018-05-03 16:53:44 I've actually been waiting for over an hour for my oil change and I'm so over this. 
3114 2018-05-03 16:53:41 from @molinskidan: 
Oil Price Information Service now quoting Permian barrels moving $13.25/bbl under WTI.

Midland WTI is now nearly $15/bbl less than Houston prices, and $18 less than Brent.
3115 2018-05-03 16:53:37 What lipgloss am I wearing? Oh it’s from UT Cåf’s new line “What’s Cookin Good Lookin”. This shade is called “Drowning in Oil”
3116 2018-05-03 16:53:33 Crazy idea, but what if people started carpooling and other things to avoid gas dependency. Better for the planet and rob our money back out of the oil guys' wallets.
3117 2018-05-03 16:52:44 @MarsGlobal Forget your Palm Oil Policy. STOP USING PALM OIL NOW! You're destroying 1000's of HA of rainforests... Two faced. Greedy. Selfish. Stop using palm oil (it's purely for profit).
3118 2018-05-03 16:52:44 @cricbuzz #KKRvCSK what is jadeja is doing .this is unbelievable .has he put a jug of oil on his hand.
3119 2018-05-03 16:52:38 is this specifically before you go to sleep? Or is it the bead oil you use for everything?
3120 2018-05-03 16:52:30 Oh yes Venezuela, because their plight has nothing to do with America giving them a wedgie and taking their lunch oil

3129 2018-05-03 16:51:22 I like this one because you don't need a ton of oil, and tossing two pieces at a time in a Wok worked great.

3131 2018-05-03 16:51:13 No no no. One restaurant here in Clearwater ruined a perfectly good carpaccio with truffle oil!  Oh, and I do have the cilantro gene thing going too. 
3132 2018-05-03 16:51:02 Been using a coconut oil shampoo and conditioner with occasionally using the hair smoothie but that’s cause my hairs was completely dead
3133 2018-05-03 16:51:02 Hahaha yeah apparently olive oil gets pretty hot
3134 2018-05-03 16:51:00 Prices on constant increase as the oil companies seek to steal from  drivers of their GOP tax cuts.

The Host Communities Producing Oil and Gas (HOSCON), yesterday, said it had discovered no fewer than 50 oil wells in about 12 communities in Anambra state waiting for exploration, @vanguardngrnews reports.
3144 2018-05-03 16:49:45 I always thought part of it was also the long-term effects of the oil embargo, and maybe high levels of intra- and internation tensions more generally? 
3145 2018-05-03 16:49:28 If you read the book, you will understand why I say Saddam's, but the oil came from Saddam and mostly benefited Barzani and Saddam's family.

3153 2018-05-03 16:48:59 This might have been cruel to haul Isakson back to the individuals who had maxed out their playoff series against the oil executive who was behind the leak of classified contents and building close ties with our friends and allies.

3155 2018-05-03 16:48:44 At 12:45pm I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLM18) and USO on my software.
3156 2018-05-03 16:48:39 I think the Oil Kings have had a really solid day so far.  Upgraded at forward, no outlandish picks, and addressed some organizational weaknesses.

3159 2018-05-03 16:48:21 The crop is sustainable, more so than other vegetable oils. The way it has been grown is not. That’s what sustainable palm oil groups aim to change.
3160 2018-05-03 16:48:14 Wounds may heal but scars are not gonna fade unless you use bio oil or something like that but still, the marks are still there.

3170 2018-05-03 16:47:20 More like the inner city invasion that created white flight, sub-urbanism and the urban sprawl, the concentration of wealth in the hands of corporates, the 70s energy crisis and a dependency on foreign oil. The root of this shit happened when they were teenagers.

3174 2018-05-03 16:47:07 Kai’s words to describe facts: “farce”, “tenuous”, “shrinking”. Also a believer that dilbit sinks like a rock, because dozens of federal government scientists running hundreds of tests don’t understand “facts”. Growing oil market - fact. Revenues lower - due to no pipeline - fact

3177 2018-05-03 16:46:50 What lead to the secularists to move out of the middle East? I do remember there was a vibrant social Democratic movements in the region in the 50s-60s. I.E. Iran's Mosadegh whose nationalization of oil resulted in CIA sponsored coup.

3179 2018-05-03 16:46:43 Some of you should stop tweeting Nonesense here....show us the bus they entered since you want to be relevant.....why are you even spreading lies????? Are you that bitter? Pls take lumapil and buy Bam Beauty oil for quick recovery. @Gbengaplatini1 LIARRRRRR!
3180 2018-05-03 16:46:35 Oil Prices edged higher on Thursday despite swelling US crude inventories and record weekly US production, as focus shifted back to oil cartel Opec supply cuts and the potential of new US sanctions against Iran.
3181 2018-05-03 16:46:29 There's no simple economics with oil and gas prices. There's not another commodity that is as manipulated as oil.
3182 2018-05-03 16:45:59 no..  that cost will be on the taxpayers, and we carry enough.  the gas/oil companies shouldn't be allowed to gouge us whenever there's bad weather either.. they have billions of our dollars, use a few to fix the problems ffs...
3183 2018-05-03 16:45:57 An oil derrick on the property of Beverly Hills High School produces about 400 barrels a day. The school earns about $300,000 a year in royalties.

3188 2018-05-03 16:45:32 Falling asleep in a different bed can be a challenge. I always carry my Muji aroma therapy oil diffuser (the gentle purr of the mist is my white noise machine and my favourite scents is comforting). And you’ll pry my clothes steamer out of my damp, warm hands. #luxtravelchat
3189 2018-05-03 16:45:28 Wohoo!! I either do the curl smoothie from shea moisture , or the R&B moisturizer from Lush and then the olive oil eco gel . And I shingle it through while it’s wet.

3191 2018-05-03 16:45:19 These people are the agents of American oil companies to protest the pipeline, they won't get at the discount rate as they do until now.
3192 2018-05-03 16:45:09 In 1940, The Petroleum Distribution Agency announces a $54-million contract with three U.S. companies for the purchasing of Mexican oil.
3193 2018-05-03 16:45:06 We should just make origami roses out of dollars instead of buying roses.  The money wont die.. 5x12= $60. If you want to go the extra mile, dab some rose essential oil on them and they even smell good.  #YoureWelcome
3194 2018-05-03 16:44:53 I like how you attack the younger Chris out of the two Chris’s. Pathetic.

Attack me, the Chris who worked on Off-shore oil rigs in the Persian Gulf! I’d love to go toe to toe with you on jobs.
3195 2018-05-03 16:44:51 yo tomorrow is the 2 year anniversary of my car getting smashed and oil spilled all over the hood during an oil change...one day before my french final! that’s when it sunk in that being an adult will really suck 
3196 2018-05-03 16:44:46 There's a good chance you'll soon see regular gas selling for $3 a gallon.
Concerns that President Donald Trump is about to impose new sanctions on Iran have sent oil prices climbing, and gas prices are coming along for the ride. @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenateMajLdr #thanksTrump
3197 2018-05-03 16:44:46 Exactly! Coming from Queens, I too know exactly who he is and has been all along. Just a NYC shyster, snake oil salesman.

3200 2018-05-03 16:44:40 The NHS is the best health service in the world bar none and Alderhey one of the best for paediatric care. So, as much as heart disagrees with the courts decision my head sees the logic. It’s very difficult and very sad. There will always be a salesman selling snake oil....
3201 2018-05-03 16:44:24 Big O Tires in Blue Springs takes forever to do an oil change
3202 2018-05-03 16:44:14 Picture this. Oil prices dropped globally. Domestically it's increasing weekly. The economy is down. Money is not circulating. High pricing of commodities.  CBK is about to lift capping of rates. Someone is doing well & it's not the consumer!!! Recession
3203 2018-05-03 16:44:03 Bam Bam could turn out to be the biggest winner of #BBNaija. 

I am impressed too. Esp with the beauty oil sale. I had to go study her IG account.

She has the fashion, poise, look, celebrity people clout, & the brain. 

The real winner is the one with sustainability skills.

3205 2018-05-03 16:43:49 So, Republicans control oil prices?
3206 2018-05-03 16:43:42 Cozying up to the oil industry. A proud Reform/Conservative party tradition.

3209 2018-05-03 16:43:39 In my opinion all oil or balm makeup removers are a waste of money. Youre mostly getting 50ml of product for $$$ when coconut oil and olive oil do the same thing and do it well..
3210 2018-05-03 16:43:38 Not that complicated really. Israel is a home for the Jewish people granted by the British on Palastinian territory. Israel is also a military satellite state for Western oil interests in the ME (along with Saudi Arabia) which means they are both allowed certain exemptions
3211 2018-05-03 16:43:35 Alaskans own 6,235,364 shares of BP PLC, worth $42,880,653. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED KINGDOM.
3212 2018-05-03 16:42:58 Stopping oil pipeline = aligned 

Spreading misinformation/agitation = not aligned
3213 2018-05-03 16:42:55 Oil companies and supporters are manipulating us just like the Russians manipulate the Americans.
Gas prices are controlled by the Oil industry and speculators. Bitumen pipeline has nothing to do with gas prices.
Blame the gready corporations.

3219 2018-05-03 16:42:30 Again, it is time for the vast majority of the West who are not involved in oil-gas-coal-welfare ranching to stand up for public lands and conservation.  The way things are going under Zinke-Trump, the West will lose all that makes it attractive place to live or visit.
3220 2018-05-03 16:42:24 Yes bike is running great! Changed the oil this weekend so I’m good for awhile

3225 2018-05-03 16:41:50 I really need to go get my oil changed.
3226 2018-05-03 16:41:47 I broke a nail donating blood today @nailogical I also fainted but that isn’t important. My nails had been doing so well with proper filing and nail oil.

3229 2018-05-03 16:41:23 The Modi Govt is pocketing the benefits of low international crude oil prices instead of passing them on to the people.

3233 2018-05-03 16:41:12 Oh, you don’t know how much I enjoyed working on my previous car… Now, it’s been three years since I sold it and I’m yearning to go back to stuff like this.

I think I developed a thing for being covered in dirt, car lube and motor oil.

3252 2018-05-03 16:39:08 You do realize that pretty much every tradesmen working on oil and gas in the province is a union member right?  You realize teachers and nurses also are union members right?  What you're proposing is to kneecap collective bargaining, it's stupid and incredibly uninformed.
3253 2018-05-03 16:39:06 Mate, don't. I saw people start working there develop drug addictions, mental health conditions, etc. Most staff in the kitchen had scars from oil dripping from the 2 paten grills and toasters. never worked anywhere like it since. The customers are worse though.
3254 2018-05-03 16:38:57 I live in Santa Barbara, the Green movement began here, over oil spills at Refugio Beach.This is the home of the Environmental movement and NONE of us vote in the Green Party because the only people to pass policy moving green issues were Democrats and beach owning GOP.
3255 2018-05-03 16:38:49 Idc my skin has been really dry and itchy lately but I’ve been putting oil on my scalp almost daily. I started using a new shampoo and conditioner and that may be the issue.
3256 2018-05-03 16:38:41 The only time I use a moisturizer is right before i wear make up or in the winter otherwise I dont use one because I have oily skin, it’s clean & clear oil free moisturizer
3257 2018-05-03 16:38:22 and when you didn't have ATTHS LOL  which was like throwing another gallon of gasoline on an oil rig fire
3258 2018-05-03 16:37:54 We buy from EU and globally and the only significant increases have been due to oil and, recently, big paper increases from Euro Mills - nothing to do with #Brexit - but as we’re both in sunny SW happy to discuss.
3259 2018-05-03 16:37:51 B/c they want a gas pipeline thru Syria to Europe vs Iran doing it! Also

3262 2018-05-03 16:37:48 They need to drill down even deeper -- #DAPL and ALL the pipelines in U.S. are being installed by Putin trolls posing as "oil co. workers" -- in order to (1) steal all of US and Canada's oil and (2) make 0bama, Warren, Clinton and rest of the #PipelineProfieers look bad
3263 2018-05-03 16:37:48 @taketwo Talking about oil production in California without connecting that oil with the rapid destruction of our livable climate is like talking about future cigarette production & use without connecting the health damage. #KeepItInTheGround #ICantBreathe
3264 2018-05-03 16:37:45 I'm so pale this year. I need to use the hot tip @tianajean gave me and cover myself in baby oil and lay in the sun. Man, I was so tan that year. Let's hope I don't get cancer, just a sick ass tan.
3265 2018-05-03 16:37:37 Is that snow on the coal, or oil burning through the snow, on the pickup?
3266 2018-05-03 16:37:25 mug cakes are an affront to god. i made one like 3 years ago and followed the recipe to a T but all i could taste when i ate it was straight olive oil. it was hell

3270 2018-05-03 16:36:53 Why does my face produce so much oil
3271 2018-05-03 16:36:49 Oh Rich. If you're gonna make a political statement at lesst know that its NEVER the President's fault, whether its Trump, Obama or Bush when it comes to oil prices. They never determine the production rate or how much a barrel costs. Next.
3272 2018-05-03 16:36:48 NO WAR FOR OIL
3273 2018-05-03 16:36:34 God knows you need prayer, holy water, holy oil, communion juice, the bible and much more.

3313 2018-05-03 16:31:19 Strange that RUB depreciating with oil near maximums
3314 2018-05-03 16:30:59 Coconut oil lmao
3315 2018-05-03 16:30:56 the only problem is that big oil companies will do everything in their power to prevent full scale hemp production because it has potential to ruin them
3316 2018-05-03 16:30:50 Shorting WTI oil futures here on US dollar getting bid back up again.
3317 2018-05-03 16:30:43 All that foreign oil Quebec is accepting.
3318 2018-05-03 16:30:35 The same way they'll say bams oil is just oil. Why don't they produce their own abegiiii
3319 2018-05-03 16:30:32 @HalftimeReport @CNBCClosingBell @CNBC @CNBCClosingBell @SquawkCNBC WOW! WALL STREET IN BED WITH OIL. The top 1% con men at cnbc have shorted @Tesla and driving up gasoline prices up for all of us the 99% for GREED and corruption. 1 company inder attack by establishment.

3321 2018-05-03 16:30:29 Thank you Trump.  For price increase at the gas pump!  It's what we needed. A tax cut for the rich & a gas pump tax for the rest of us.
Keep threatening Iran.  That's raising the price of oil & making the stock market drop.

3330 2018-05-03 16:29:22 Haha glad you saw it Brett!! Absolutely agree :)  Have a lovely evening!!!
3331 2018-05-03 16:29:17 It is a conundrum. We have switched to a peanut butter that doesn’t have palm oil in it and I am checking labels and avoiding buying palm oil items. Ingredients should be on shampoo and soap. I understand carex uses it but I can’t find it in ingredients!
3332 2018-05-03 16:29:06 This may sound strange, but been putting a little fat (cream, coconut oil, organic butter) in the first cup every morning. Replaces breakfast with healthy fats. Find it helps my concentration. #ketogenicdiet

3334 2018-05-03 16:28:41 I thought when frying Bacon that a lot of smoke meant there wasn't enough oil.

One fire alarm and a kitchen that was so smoky I now need a tracheotomy later, I realise I was wrong.

New cookbook out in July.
3335 2018-05-03 16:28:40 i’ve started eating a table spoon of coconut oil a day, i’m off birth control and i’m eating more vegetables... it’s over for you hoes...
3336 2018-05-03 16:28:38 Marvel Mystery Oil smells good enough to drink. Just somthing to rattle around in your empty fucking skulls
3337 2018-05-03 16:28:31 aloe vera + tea tree oil + rose water  are currently my saving grace for my acne the prone skin, i've been experiencing severe breakouts since jan and my skin is finally healing and  has become more supple and radiant - thank the good lord

3344 2018-05-03 16:27:35 Hey, just a tip for people with very dry skin and who want to minimize light scars I highly recommend buying some Jajoba Oil. It's very similar in makeup to your skin's natural oils and I originally learned about it to help heal piercings and to prevent it scarring unevenly
3345 2018-05-03 16:27:26 God Senior your country is more corrupt than Nigeria, shell explore our oil and don't develop the people, our monies are brought into your country to buy mortgages you don't ask receive the pay with out asking for the source, your country is bigger corrupt.
3346 2018-05-03 16:27:21 Are you going to tour the pristine wilderness Lisa gave away before your Big Oil and Gas buddies destroy it?

3347 2018-05-03 16:27:17 จริงอยู่ว่าไม่มีคำว่าโตสำหรับพ่อแม่ แต่ถ้าพ่อแม่ยังเอาตัวเองเป็นเกาะป้องกันลูก ถ้าวันหนึ่งเกาะนั้นไม่อยู่แล้ว คนที่ต้องเผชิญโลกความเป็นจริงก็มีแค่ตัวเรา พอโดนอะไรนิดหน่อยก็อ่อนแอรับความจริงไม่ได้ อายุขนาดนี้แล้วไม่จำเป็นต้องกอดไว้แนบอก แค่ห่วงอยู่ห่างๆก็พอ

しかしイチロー本人はこれに納得したのかな…
3349 2018-05-03 16:27:00 We need to encourage farmers to grow hemp. Not sure how to go about that, but it is the answer. It can do anything oil can do and more. Fuel our cars, make biodegradable plastic, make paper, build houses, cloth and feed us. And it can do it without the carbon footprint.
3350 2018-05-03 16:26:56 podobno bio oil
3351 2018-05-03 16:26:56 Yeah and Saudi Arab.... Oh right, it doesn't matter when you have an interest in selling arms and getting oil
3352 2018-05-03 16:26:56 I almost lost my job a hour ago. I was two seconds from throwing oil in a customer face.

3356 2018-05-03 16:26:09 I equate him with the great and powerful OZ from the movie. All bluuff and bluster, but really just a carnival flim flam snake oil salesman. I've always seen him this way. For years. Almost everytime he'd be on tv or radio he just sounded like a blowhard. Shut him off.
3357 2018-05-03 16:25:49 I do X quirky weird thing SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY!! You're a corporate shill selling snake oil! Don't listen to @yishan, he's a fake!

3361 2018-05-03 16:25:17 Putting Oil & Gas professionals out of work isn't a "bug" to the Liberals. It's a key feature.

3363 2018-05-03 16:24:57 This olive oil shampoo be having me feel like god came down from the heavens to help me wash my hair this morning 
3364 2018-05-03 16:24:55 Getting sequestered at Pacifico Hyundai for an oil change and maintenance is like the best thing ever, i've gotten several deadlines done.
3365 2018-05-03 16:24:50 I guess canned video is better than F*x 'News' but it's weird hearing about Hudson River painters & Harlem Renaissance while getting oil changed...

3370 2018-05-03 16:23:51 I need to start sprouting flax again. I would rather all my hemp seeds to become mature plants that produce alternatives to oil products which currently are destroying eco systems.
3371 2018-05-03 16:23:46 Y’all...it’s no secret that I love smoothies, pressed juices and açaí bowls. Today, the shop told me they were going to put some drops of CBD oil in my juice. I’m like okay. Idk what that is but it sounds healthy. I hop on google and I just did drugs. Omg!
3372 2018-05-03 16:23:44 This article is a transparent attempt to justify oil and gas drilling on land set aside for the public.  It’s bullshit.
3373 2018-05-03 16:23:41 Haven't tried almond based ice cream, however coconut based milk is so much tastier than almond based milk, that I'm presently hooked on anything coconut,  besides the research showing coconut oil is good for the brain.

3379 2018-05-03 16:23:06 Black Castor oil, Wild Growth Hair Oil ( on amazon) & Biotin supplements will help. Be great 
3380 2018-05-03 16:22:54 Stephen how are you reconciling the fact that current coal exports from BC will achieve comparable CO2 global release numbers in 28 years compared to the 65 years for the oil that the article quotes? More than twice as fast?
3381 2018-05-03 16:22:53 @ChrisEvans what did you use to make your beard grow that much in a year? Jamaican Castor Oil? Beard Balm? Money?

3385 2018-05-03 16:22:38 im getting my oil changed for the first time by myself and the guy told me to pop open the hood and i opened the trunk... 

I SUCK AT ADULTING
3386 2018-05-03 16:22:29 they are not selling fuel based on oil purchased this week! - they buy months in advance as a future - the price they paid for this fuel selling today would have been negotiated before christmas..
3387 2018-05-03 16:22:27 It's time to change the National Anthem to "Kenya Yetu ni Nchi ya Ajabu" if now MPs have to go benchmark in a kingdom where the only common denominator is an oil well.  These are fruits of shaking hands...
3388 2018-05-03 16:22:25 Conservatives really love to fight for their own land like “my granddaddy grazed cattle here”
But turn a cheek and say “it’s easier for the oil industry” when native land is threatened
3389 2018-05-03 16:22:18 I used to hate getting braided because every braider always wanted to use a gang of grease or oil in my hair. I just told them not to.
3390 2018-05-03 16:22:07 I swear, I'm honest.   For example, getting killed on run over eur and jpy options (that got exercised into futures) at the moment...

Doing well on oil, gold, and silver...

A bit ruin over on wheat, but not worried...
3391 2018-05-03 16:22:05 I think the goal is to use the momentum that the sustainable palm oil demand is creating and move growth of palm for palm oil to already deforested areas

3394 2018-05-03 16:21:54 Experimented with grape seed oil earlier and have come to the conclusion that I should put it on closer to bed time.
3395 2018-05-03 16:21:54 You need the hemp hearts. Sprouting any seeds make them more bioavailable. The shell is tough to digest. And like most food, the less processing the better. The oil is nutritious and simply pressed.
3396 2018-05-03 16:21:48 The United Nations is an anti-semitic organization made-up of dictators who do not care about their people, Only Money, oil, and Power.

Even If Israel has to stand alone,
 They will still stand strong. 
God bless Israel, and the Jewish people scattered around the world.
3397 2018-05-03 16:21:41 and the supply of oil is being affected by..what, exactly?? Speculation?
3398 2018-05-03 16:21:28 I am expecting to hear:
Trump: "The Geneva Convention was a very bad deal for the US. Obama really blew it with that one. Very unfair. The US can no longer bomb innocents, take the oil as a spoil of war. Very bad."
3399 2018-05-03 16:21:20 The thing is in Oklahoma at that time there was an open industry of marrying Native women for their land/money/oil rights so if your grandfather was the light skinned one it might have been easier in Oklahoma. It was also perfectly acceptable to openly hire someone to kill her.

3402 2018-05-03 16:21:02 If by running around for the government trying to secure the Middle East so that we have some sort of foot hold when oil starts to become scarce rather than pursuing alternative energy sources is “insurance” then I want to cancel the policy cause it’s a rip off
3403 2018-05-03 16:20:38 All true. I just don’t know if it’s wise to move the problems that palm oil causes onto another commodity when there is motivation for corporations to look into sustainable palm oil - public outcry and a very profitable product at the same time
3404 2018-05-03 16:20:30 A lot of canned beans aren’t vegan because of the seasonings or oil used.

3423 2018-05-03 16:18:13 I've never tried oil paints before but they seem beautiful. Ah, I'm not artistic one bit... I just do it sometimes as a form of destressing /he said, chuckling after; I hope that day comes soon then! I really will look forward to it.
3424 2018-05-03 16:18:09 The irony: 30min ago i was googling about pain and its units,now im crying because i got my hand burnt by boiling cooking oil,,damn painful
3425 2018-05-03 16:18:01 Ugh! How can unflavored taste so bad! I was so excited about this for my bullet proof coffee but I couldn't drink it, it was bad. Does the c8 oil have flavor? I added both and left out the mct oil. 
3426 2018-05-03 16:17:56 @tommyfarrell719 We like the way you think. Hope you're having a great day! The next time you need an oil change, keep us in mind!

3436 2018-05-03 16:16:40 Wish these oil companies would pay a production tax 4 just 1 month, that would help! The rich R greedy, don't care about any1!
3437 2018-05-03 16:16:33 You will get a sheen on the pan, but no oil. It works better than any can oil spray like pam. I think also using the right ladle -- half inverted dome shape. Then you work it in circles. Simple.
3438 2018-05-03 16:16:21 Going after oil company good luck with that

3440 2018-05-03 16:16:17 will make this egregious error? Because we have done this before. First, during the ozone-depleting substance phase out. Then re: crude oil, met coal & LNG exports, which pay CO2 tax to govts of Japan & Korea & will be CO2 tax exempt under @JustinTrudeau 's hybrid C-pricing ...4
3441 2018-05-03 16:16:16 But won’t domestic production ramp up again as the price of oil rises? @HalftimeReport @petenajarian

Please talk to your colleagues at your next cabinet meeting about this issue. Israel is our best friend in the middle east.....even if they have no oil!
3447 2018-05-03 16:15:34 Is that oil
3448 2018-05-03 16:15:30 Or buying oil for your car , or even putting gas in your car 
3449 2018-05-03 16:15:26 halibut-lemon oil hash brown. . .31
fish squid. . .25
orzo charcuterie. . .6
3450 2018-05-03 16:15:12 lsn im trying to level up with arab generational wealth!! my kink is oil money and reparations 
3451 2018-05-03 16:15:09 Poisons have been removed from the marketplace? Poison is in every river stream and ocean now. Rates of cancer, asthma and other related illnesses are skyrocketing. I'd rather take my chances with the snake oil salesman who mostly sold opiates anyway, not poison.
3452 2018-05-03 16:15:08 Ok, now you are making a different argument. So let me be clear...It doesn't matter who the President is, or what they accomplish. RFK could rise from the grave and fully implement a plan to feed the poor, get us off oil, make peace throughout the world, and create an economic 1/
3453 2018-05-03 16:15:02 He brought a bit more then the invincibles? Imagine if oil barons hadn't of ruined football or if FFP actually worked. He did amazingly well with what he was up against.
3454 2018-05-03 16:14:54 IN THE BIN! IN THE BIN! IN THE BIN! (Leaflet or snake oil salesman, I don't mind which)
3455 2018-05-03 16:14:54 Up here getting my oil changed
3456 2018-05-03 16:14:49 Bout to run that and this oregano oil!!
3457 2018-05-03 16:14:46 Progesterone in oil injections. Helps support pregnancy from my understanding.  I didn’t do the Lupron.  I think the crinone is a brand name for progesterone if I’m not mistaken
3458 2018-05-03 16:14:44 Going to an oil change for me is like going to a physical  but then the doctor tells you you also have cancer
3459 2018-05-03 16:14:41 When rubbish is your biggest export and creating and resourcing war is your only real income add to that poncing off others oil that fluffs a debr based economy..what more can we expect from the teenagers of plane-t earth.
3460 2018-05-03 16:14:40 This was late 2013, early 2014. I was sent a link to this video about 20 times in 2014. He doesn't say there's anything wrong with GERS then. Oil revenues were higher then and this is why GERS was used.
3461 2018-05-03 16:14:17 I come to church for the socialism, stay for the oil paintings. #PollingDay #VoteLabour
3462 2018-05-03 16:14:06 Yeah I get from 2428 to 2965 depending on the node.
at the cost of 38 or 36 oil. 
Adds up to 15.5k exp, but the backline is in tathers. Too many petards get through on auto. Think I should use battleships instead. 96 runs at 222 oil means 21312 oil. Think I'm gonna run timer
3463 2018-05-03 16:14:03 When oil goes up, people get jobs. It's just good business. Besides, what do I care...it's not like I've put gas in a vehicle in decades. #TranslateTrump
3464 2018-05-03 16:13:59 Give me a break!? Amerikkkan exceptionalism is ignoring that the rest of the world struggles when the US has invaded and killed 30+ million since WW2 in wars based on LIES. This is after US oil oligarchs funded and created the Nazi regime.
3465 2018-05-03 16:13:37 Oil in Oklahoma makes companies Billions of dollars a year in profits.  Yet we as a state continually give huge tax breaks to oil companies.  Legislators do this not citizens.  Look at all their donations oil lobbyists litter their list of donors. Is that money for nothing?
3466 2018-05-03 16:13:35 I find it depends on the oil and how/where I use it. It's better by balm on my muscles and joints, in general, but I also had it in a drink and it was swell.
3467 2018-05-03 16:13:34 When that coconut oil melts, you know it’s fucking thotty weather.
3468 2018-05-03 16:13:30 THANKS FOR CAUTIONING HERE BUT TOO DO IT TO PRESIDENT ASKING HE STOP EXCAVATIONS OR USA IS THE DONOR OF THE EARTH TO HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR COLLAPSING WE.TAKING OUT OUR OIL TOO THREATENING WE..WITHOUT PAYING A PENNY..TILL NOW WE THE SOLE LANDOWNER WORLD ON UN RECORDS ARE AS FILE 1.
3469 2018-05-03 16:13:27 Also I have observed (I have decades of observation & consumption experience) it helps (?) to cut a large onion unpeeled onion in half. You leave it unpeeled so you can hold on to it from one end. Dip this in ghee/oil and wipe down the entire pan.
3470 2018-05-03 16:13:16 5G overrides bird brains causing them to commit suicide by running into electric car windshields as an Oil Company conspiracy.
(5G is @Foxnews for our slower followers)
3471 2018-05-03 16:13:03 Kobe Mohr, who took a puck to the face in December and suffered a broken orbital bone, nose and tear duct, had 11 goals and 28 points in 58 games with the Oil Kings last season. Returned to ice five weeks after injury.
3472 2018-05-03 16:12:55 Free oil changes and car washes for life! I'm never leaving @Cadillac #caddyclub
3473 2018-05-03 16:12:48 Jonathan administration enjoys oil boom, the same boom is here now with $75 per barrel now, hope we can allow Jonathan some peace and quiet now.
3474 2018-05-03 16:12:20 I was about to get a LITTLE worried there. We have some insane levels of connected devices now and an essential oil diffuser being connected wouldn’t really shock me at this point. New business venture idea? #IDGTECHtalk
3475 2018-05-03 16:12:14 It’s one thing to stand with Israel and the Jews who are only practicing their faith, it’s another thing to stand against the Zionists and those in Israel who want war so they can take Golan Heights and profit from oil and minerals. A lot of GREED in business men in that country
3476 2018-05-03 16:12:12 So sad. Keep emailing and texting supermarkets and food manufacturers to tell them to quit using palm oil. You know people power is the best power!
3477 2018-05-03 16:12:11 Anyone else tried CBD oil and not feel a goddamn thing?
3478 2018-05-03 16:12:09 Smoked an oil pen and ate 3 popsicles in bed before falling asleep at 9:30. You're doing great!
3479 2018-05-03 16:12:06 On 2), I limit myself to observing how desperate Oil are to turn around the goal position next year.  So I am glad they made what seems to be a relatively significant move....though true its hard for fan to judge the quality of the guy until he plays.
3480 2018-05-03 16:12:06 Rub some tea tree oil on your temples
3481 2018-05-03 16:12:01 Best get some more oil then Cath 
3482 2018-05-03 16:12:00 “What am I, lavender?! Tea tree oil?! *softly* ...what am I?”
3483 2018-05-03 16:11:49 may pa grapeseed oil na si mayora
3484 2018-05-03 16:11:47 Shhh go get oil money that made you relevant
3485 2018-05-03 16:11:32 Nothing but nothing stinks worse than chicken shit spread in a field or politics. Well, except maybe oil and gas.
3486 2018-05-03 16:11:24 Thank goodness for Tides Canada and all the great social benefit work they support. It’s a token antidote to the non stop BS from likes of Fraser Institute and the various industry front groups spewing propaganda alongside the Canadian government’s tax payer “clean oil” hilarity.
3487 2018-05-03 16:11:23 แลปพน. Banana oil มั้ยสรึสสส
3488 2018-05-03 16:10:56 Hope you heal quickly. Use oragono oil
3489 2018-05-03 16:10:51 "Oil and gas is no longer the valuable asset, the most valuable asset is #data" says @afra_raymond now speaking at GPA's #WPFD2018 Lecture
3490 2018-05-03 16:10:42 hemp is the future of our planet, its the most versatile plant in the world!  the big oil companies HATE IT

3494 2018-05-03 16:10:08 Endless oil story
3495 2018-05-03 16:09:57 I haven't done any track days for years I'd like to go to the 'ring at some point but the shear amount of oil spills lately and accidents puts me off spirited lapping. Might be getting old before my time too!
3496 2018-05-03 16:09:52 Safaree wack ass never wrote for Nicki lmaoooo, he can't even sell coconut oil imagine if he could run the hip hop industry like Nicki 
3497 2018-05-03 16:09:50 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 3 May @ 18:00

3498 2018-05-03 16:09:46 tanning oil really my bff
3499 2018-05-03 16:09:43 Fact world oil demand will rise until 2040.  It’s our biggest industry revenue generator.  Then why is our PM and enviro minister not spending 95% of their time in Alberta helping make a first class industry even better? @cathmckenna @JustinTrudeau
3500 2018-05-03 16:09:42 I dunno if they're not in denial, but they're a port/oil town, so they really need to not be
3501 2018-05-03 16:09:40 then we support salafi islamist militias with the money that will come from yachts. then these salafis kick aramco from arabia and use oil for arabs not for kings and usa.
3502 2018-05-03 16:09:37 With their 4th round pick, 67th overall, the Oil Kings select Michael Abgrall.
3503 2018-05-03 16:09:35 ん～もう少し綿密に考える必要があるな
3504 2018-05-03 16:09:34 Coconut oil
3505 2018-05-03 16:09:23 Poor old #minimumwage folks paying through the nose as prices soar for  #gasoline to get to work. Big Oil complains production is down, even though a big player like #Exxon made $20 BILLION in profit last year and got $2 BILLION break from the slimy @GOP #taxscam. #energy
3506 2018-05-03 16:09:18 油ちゃんはせっかちね ここからスペクタルすけべがはじまるのよ
3507 2018-05-03 16:09:14 let me know when the ainstream media's "political arguments" regarding Trump involve his building a wall or drilling for oil ...

Then i will happily fight against him .

BUT THIS STORMY DANIELS SHIT ?? THIS RUSSIA SHIT ?

Fuck ya'll
3508 2018-05-03 16:09:02 I'm happy to hear that! With Trump, Pruitt, & Zinke pushing policies to increase coal/oil/gas, more wildfires seem likely. Burning fossil fuels climate change drought wildfires money needed

3509 2018-05-03 16:08:56 use acv to clean! It’s cheap. Mix with with water and some tea tree oil. it will clean everything. Eventually I want to make baby products and cleaning supplies too.
3510 2018-05-03 16:08:55 He wouldn't be bothered about doing his NYSC because the Niger/Delta oil money is always available for his likes and him to squander as they liked.
3511 2018-05-03 16:08:55 Crude oil price at US $ 74 per barrel is still lower than US $ 105 four years ago. So, why are Petrol/Diesel prices higher today than they were in May 2014?
3512 2018-05-03 16:08:50 Go to Oil City (just north of Quinault on Hoh River). Short easy hike to coast and beach hardly anyone knows about.
3513 2018-05-03 16:08:44 I wouldn't trust any move #Mueller makes.  His best bud #Comey set him in motion & #Rosenstein seconded it.  Whether Trump colluded or not they are guilty of more "rigging" than an oil rig!  "The 'insurance policy' discussed in Andy's office" is THEM
3514 2018-05-03 16:08:18 The ANC is like a man who took castor oil; going to the toilet over and over to remove bad stuff from inside himself, first Zuma, now Supra
3515 2018-05-03 16:08:09 Can I just get lavender oil at like Walmart?
3516 2018-05-03 16:08:05 Nelson is not confused about his message. Oil up, hon.
3517 2018-05-03 16:08:04 Agreed. Following!
3518 2018-05-03 16:07:27 Are you serious?!?! Essential oil diffusers are not connected? Crazy!!! #IDGTECHtalk
3519 2018-05-03 16:07:22 Almond oil or jojoba oil...that’s what I’ve been told! They’re better for the skin as well
3520 2018-05-03 16:07:17 Because coal is a limited resource and even if it isn’t causing global warming we are risking our future by changing the atmospheric balance in ways at a minimum we can’t predict. Plus we do know it id health damaging. Same for oil, gas, etc.
3521 2018-05-03 16:07:00 Thanks, I have a few more but I prefer that one!! :)  so sorry about the wait guys,  it has been hectic, juggling normal work and book stuff!!!!! Have a lovely evening :)
3522 2018-05-03 16:06:49 Baby oil doesn’t really like my skin. It dries me out. True story. What else do you think i could use? 
3523 2018-05-03 16:06:46 Poor old minimum wage #Texas folks paying through the nose for #gasoline as whiny Big Oil complains production is down, even though a big player like #Exxon made $20 BILLION in profit last year and got nearly  $2 BILLION break from the slimy @GOP #taxscam.

3527 2018-05-03 16:06:19 That is so cool! I enjoy woodworking. I make ridiculously luxurious bird houses and squirrel houses (get's me away from the computer). I typically leave the wood as-is for a weathered "tree-blending" look, but I now may consider wax/linseed oil.
3528 2018-05-03 16:06:03 Cybrigade is a social media platform which is run by energetic and motivated youth to demonstrate the positive & soft image of Pakistan.
 It has such patriotic leaders who are burning midnight oil for this country.

3529 2018-05-03 16:05:50 Aye bra baby oil sex is amazing having the ass all oiled up
3530 2018-05-03 16:05:39 Not to be dramatic but rose hip oil changed my lifeeeeeee
3531 2018-05-03 16:05:39 Just enjoy the wealth by selling oil..
3532 2018-05-03 16:05:31 Have you tried just CBD oil?
3533 2018-05-03 16:05:24 Wait for the oil to cool down, pour it in the old container that has a lid, then throw it in the bin. ^p
3534 2018-05-03 16:05:16 Yeah right. 

VW have been promising this for 3yrs. When’s it going to happen?  Wasn’t Bosch touting “green” Diesel last month?

It’s all double-talk to confuse & obfuscate. If people are confused they stay with what they know. Giving oil another reprieve.

Lies are wearing thin.
3535 2018-05-03 16:05:04 We cannot let these people in.  Go to the United Nations to solve this problem.  Mexico is an oil rich country.  Where is the humanitarian efforts for even their own people.  THEY need to be sanctioned by the U N to take in these people and TO CREATE JOBS FOR THEM.
3536 2018-05-03 16:04:59 Yeah, your racist tropes just revealed your underbelly, which is the same as your oil billionaires. #instablock
3537 2018-05-03 16:04:56 For those interested, look into the economics of the "crack spread", there are several reasons for why the price of petroleum products do not directly follow that of crude oil.
3538 2018-05-03 16:04:51 Before getting rid of palm oil, the impact of the alternatives should be considered. We must push the industry to abide by strict environmental standards before it is too late. 1/2
3539 2018-05-03 16:04:48 Nice and lovely picture!! Thank you

No hammer.
3547 2018-05-03 16:04:26 Isn’t palm oil actually more sustainable than most other plant oils already? Not to mention that there are certified sustainable palm oil organizations and i don’t see those organizations for other types of oil
3548 2018-05-03 16:04:22 D Pauls is in Indian Oil Building on Janpath. Bon Bon is 4th or 5th shop on Right Hand Side on Janpath coming from CP.
3549 2018-05-03 16:04:06 Hmmm,  NYSC does not care whether or not you are an oil company. Once you write them, they release corp members to you. Besides, why trying to be anonymous?
3550 2018-05-03 16:04:04 Want a free cab Tucson? LYFT is giving promo code for up 2 $50 bucks. Enter LR4 as LYFT code. Skip Uber. Super coup. oil
3551 2018-05-03 16:03:54 It happened at the NDP convention.  Weir got into a disagreement with an apparatchik in the leaders' office over a speech he wanted to deliver calling for the carbon tax to applied to imported oil.  Weir says the false allegations were punishment for that.
3552 2018-05-03 16:03:40 I’m over the obsessive “Melanin” phase. I’ve been dark all my life now people can make money off dark skin and baby oil and it’s all the rage. I hate it
3553 2018-05-03 16:03:39 Superior this year and at the minute yes. But c'mon it'll not last and u know it.  

Original point- "Money aside" what top player would ever have signed for the yo yo club that was city unless they had the oil money? 
Fool.
3554 2018-05-03 16:03:33 You’re totally entitled to be as cranky and grumpy as you want!!! A mattress is freaking expensive! And sleep and a good night’s rest is damn important. Glad the CBD oil worked!

3556 2018-05-03 16:03:21 Don't believe everything you read.  A bit of self- deprecation to oil the wheels of discourse.

Can you explain the system? Or is it opaque to you too?

3563 2018-05-03 16:02:33 Alternative forms of energy is the only answer. We should cut down the amount of ships carrying oil that go up and down our coast by one or two per year. Just like the C.A.R.B. Sets the standards for auto emissions we have to take control of our environment.
3564 2018-05-03 16:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

3571 2018-05-03 16:01:57 @elonmusk These 3 troglodytes are driving me nuts. But, can a NAV update jiggle the wheel for an upcoming turn? (good reason to hold on too). Next they'll want an oil pressure gauge in the middle!

3574 2018-05-03 16:01:49 Did they just change your oil or do other things like check your lights/tires/air filter ?

3578 2018-05-03 16:01:35 It's been made with coconut oil instead of palm oil for over a year now? We haven't noticed a difference in consistency though. How are you storing it?

3583 2018-05-03 16:01:21 # Truly amazing results!!!  So last week I got an email from CTFO ( this is the magnificent company that is responsible for the CBD products & specifically herbal or hemp oil)  So the email said shipping to Canada will be temporarily halted until the Canadian laws are modified.

3595 2018-05-03 16:00:22 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
3596 2018-05-03 16:00:21 I've spent too much money since I got paid. And I still need to go get my oil changed and buy some glasses.
3597 2018-05-03 16:00:19 Tana Mongeau gets free weed and the fancy backwoods with the oil and glass tips sent to her like every month almost and I am so bitter that’s not me
3598 2018-05-03 16:00:14 Clearly pissed that all the oil money in the world can’t buy European titles.
3599 2018-05-03 16:00:03 Also remembered oil prices are up. Which means exports are actually significantly increasing. When you remove oil.
3600 2018-05-03 16:00:02 Oil imports should start to decrease by 2020. Which accounts for about a third of our trade deficit.
3601 2018-05-03 15:59:55 Paper oil gue ga kepake. Lagian udh tau muka dry ngapain beli *ngomelin diri sendiri*
3602 2018-05-03 15:59:49 I guess @jiffylube doesn’t want to be in business anymore. They lure all their customers in with $19.99/ 21.99 oil changes. Now those prices have DOUBLED. Their least expensive oil change is $40.
That’s ridiculous! Losing customers fast you are.

3604 2018-05-03 15:59:35 Tell the truth, your there to protect the oil agreement with Shia regime in 2003.
Your afraid ISIS will not honor the oil agreement. Ask @brett_mcgurk
3605 2018-05-03 15:59:33 Will be streaming as soon as I get home. Had to do some errands and change the oil in my car.
3606 2018-05-03 15:59:32 Chris you could do something nobody else has done.... produce some actual proof about assad's famous atrocities not from people who have defected or from groups funded by the Atlantic Council US UK GCC, not from the times who's owner is stealing oil from occupied syria !! ya know
3607 2018-05-03 15:59:30 Ten items that contain palm oil... lipstick, pizza dough, instant noodles, shampoo, ice cream, detergent, chocolate, cookies, soap, biodiesel!! #startwith1thing #saveleuserecosystem

3610 2018-05-03 15:59:17 Then they start going through their rolodex of tired strategies. Which one to use? May 13th threats? Melayu tak bersyukur? Threaten no more Chinese ministers? Threaten to cut oil subsidies? So many options....
3611 2018-05-03 15:59:13 Wait, I thought #OOTT was Olive Oil Trading Tweeters, I feel duped

3613 2018-05-03 15:58:59 What a pity to the residents of Machakos. Pouring on ballast and painting the with waste oil
3614 2018-05-03 15:58:57 Shocking news when I read it this morning - apparently to focus on 'Selling Oil products' as a group...

3617 2018-05-03 15:58:50 My political hypothesis for several years has been: If there was no fish, oil, natural gas, or mineral resources in the South China Sea, the disputes could still not be resolved.
3618 2018-05-03 15:58:49 Right now, Jorge Moreno Morales is explaining the role of palm oil in Peru’s agriculture: “Palm oil drives only 1.2% of deforestation in Peru”. @minagri, how do we get this number to 0? #PalmaSostenible

How pathetic to think everyone wants and loves her ignorant, arrogant, racist behind and wants her as First Lady forever.....nope neverrather soak in hot oil.
3621 2018-05-03 15:58:20 Finally getting an oil change. I look cute so hopefully I’ll finesse a discount.
3622 2018-05-03 15:58:19 @tonykatz Just say no to the Crossfire. It's a Mercedes in disguise and the maintenance is really expensive. Even regular things like oil changes are shockingly high.
3623 2018-05-03 15:58:16 This is a good development for the #MadeInAba project. Imagine the huge financial benefit, ease of doing business it brings to the Aba industry! Now get functional ports close to the East, sort out rail, road and costal transport and watch the southeast become the new oil

3625 2018-05-03 15:58:05 Yes. And personally I’d like to see lower taxes, even though “marginal tax” says...not that much.

But the healthcare system works fine, so “free market is the only working system” is evidently not true.

As for Norway...they have oil. For now.
3626 2018-05-03 15:58:03 So it there like an order form....
3627 2018-05-03 15:58:02 It’s none of the doctors business and CBD oil is good for you. No matter the age.
3628 2018-05-03 15:58:00 So...FYI, fried garlic in chili oil is delicious, but should probably be used as a seasoning, not a snack food #someregrets #andalsoreflux
3629 2018-05-03 15:57:57 Good thing I woke up early for my oil change. Damn typhoon outside my door right now
3630 2018-05-03 15:57:53 What’s CBD oil?
3631 2018-05-03 15:57:35 Halos masuka suka ako nung ininom ko yung castor oil eww
3632 2018-05-03 15:57:23 Recommend sending them a few Piazza gift baskets consisting of Olive Oil and a Squatty Potty®
#Brockmire #MikePiazza #ItalianCatcher
3633 2018-05-03 15:57:13 If we stop that, then stop every subsidy to every oil and gas company. Personally I don't think we need to be giving handouts to any of them
3634 2018-05-03 15:56:57 Can somebody take my car to get thya oil changed ? Or change it please  I don’t have time
3635 2018-05-03 15:56:49 Yet #UCP claim oil industry has lost due to NDP govt, yet you are saying gains by O&G are reasons for growth.
No wonder CP is sliding. Liars always lose
@jkenney
3636 2018-05-03 15:56:47 My nose is working in  overdrive today. I could smell oil AND dandelions while standing in a parking lot. Also this dude's breath. 
3637 2018-05-03 15:56:43 Edmonton Oil Kings have acquired much needed skill through the WHL Bantam Draft and a slew of trades today.
EDM went through a predictable down cycle after winning the only Memorial Cup by a WHL team in the last decade back in 2014, and winning WHL titles in 2012 and 2014.
3638 2018-05-03 15:56:26 Why did they bother with subsidizing this guy, anyway? They usually try to suppress anything that don't burn oil, then blame the public!!
3639 2018-05-03 15:56:25 Crunchy peanut butter, black bean chilli oil and the best seasons tomatoes you can get your mits on :)
3640 2018-05-03 15:56:18 Even better if we replace the oil.  After Feb 7th I expect the Iranians would be leery of a physical attack.
3641 2018-05-03 15:56:14 I'm your oil wtf 
3642 2018-05-03 15:56:12 2) I understand for better quality you pay better price. no doubt. Example- Medreleaf sells CBD oil for $200 - 50 ml. I will never buy that shit. I will always prefer a decent product with a decent pricing. thats the reaon I went with Broken coast and OGI
3643 2018-05-03 15:56:06 Cut them into halves or 4 roast with a little olive oil salt and pepper and drizzle a toss in a bit of balsamic vinegar and honey

3653 2018-05-03 15:55:22 The fact that I gotta pay more to fill up my tank than to get an oil change is wild

3666 2018-05-03 15:53:50 Texans have known that for decades guy's and we've always wondered how it got that name. In 1891 it did regulate Railroads, oil and gas came along later and in 1984 the Fed's took over Trucking, Trains and Buses but the RRC chugged on with oil and gas. 
3667 2018-05-03 15:53:27 tried CBD oil this morning and literally anxiety who? never heard of her!
3668 2018-05-03 15:53:21 Marinade it in oil, lemon, and rigani for a day then chargrill it and serve with salsa chimichurri.
3669 2018-05-03 15:53:14 It’s not all or nothing. Oil won’t disappear,just this oil pipeline  Alberta gdp up 4.9%, highest in Canada, they don’t need the pipeline to make a tonne of cash. All that and a NDP government

3677 2018-05-03 15:52:37 They all can be called that, difference f consistency depends on how much oil and butter added to the mix that's all
3678 2018-05-03 15:52:32 Very interesting - thanks. The nebulous part of the analysis is the considerable differences in the "rack rate" of oil between Vancouver & everywhere else. "Mostly due to transportation difficulties"?Might it be more capricious than that?

3692 2018-05-03 15:51:26 i started putting bio oil on my inner thigh scars 2 nights ago n theyre almost gone. i can wear shorts this summer omg
3693 2018-05-03 15:51:20 Hope that happens before US uses the military to  'corner the market' in crude oil - again. Which seems to be their financial big idea at the moment.
3694 2018-05-03 15:51:16 Hi Laura, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. Our priority is to avoid using palm oil unless it is absolutely necessary for the quality. Thanks.

3706 2018-05-03 15:50:12 Oil flows down to the lowest point. If we want anointing, we must humble ourselves and bow low. That’s where the power will always pool.

3712 2018-05-03 15:49:37 I agree.  We need Medicare for All. // They are also taking our national monuments back from the people and then allowing oil companies to rape our previous public lands for oil and gas, while destroying the atmosphere.  And not paying the American people for this theft.
3713 2018-05-03 15:49:35 Frfr I’m covering myself with cooking oil and laying in the sun when I get home. I better get tan bro

3720 2018-05-03 15:48:28 The #Kamloops Blazers continuing to make moves at the draft. They have traded 20-year-old Quinn Benjafield to the Edmonton Oil Kings for 19-year-old forward Kobe Mohr.
3721 2018-05-03 15:48:20 No, we don’t.  I would never vote to legalize marijuana.  You can get the medicinal benefits with CBD oil without getting high.
3722 2018-05-03 15:48:18 Ever since I started using Vitamin E & C oil, my skin has been looking motherfucking flawless 
3723 2018-05-03 15:48:16 Please give at least one example since the oil industry has so much money i don't believe they need anyone's help
3724 2018-05-03 15:48:16 I find hard working men really attractive working outdoors, as in oil fields, construction, etc. 
3725 2018-05-03 15:48:10 As far as I know, it's the consistency. Sellou is drier, zemitta more wet/has more oil and stuff. Sfouf is just a different name for one of them mais je me rappelle plus lequel. I might be completely wrong though
3726 2018-05-03 15:48:08 I feel you! But ima just put on some baby oil gel & top it off with some highlighter!

3728 2018-05-03 15:48:03 I remember this well. Ross Barkley scored a screamer to start the match and I heard someone cheering in the back of the pub. Guy wearing an official Everton shirt, he was over the moon.  After the match he walked up to me and said 'oil money scum'. I laughed at him.

3730 2018-05-03 15:47:50 Tighter and more volatile global financial conditions could increase borrowing costs further for oil import countries, adding to existing fiscal sustainability concerns, weighing on bank balance sheets, and undermining private sector activity. @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar
3731 2018-05-03 15:47:49 Where I get the weed oil from for my pen?
3732 2018-05-03 15:47:46 Gas prices go up when oil prices go up! Oil prices go up when productivity and manufacturing output rises!

3737 2018-05-03 15:47:10 Deuteronomy 32:13 He let them ride over the highlands and feast on the crops of the fields. He nourished them with honey from the rock     and olive oil from the stony ground. #God_of_all_Possibilities
3738 2018-05-03 15:47:07 Right?! I'm trying to get it all lined up for a much quicker turnaround than the last one, so my husband doesn't have a meltdown. I think the oil rubbed bronze would really bring some warmth to it all, along with the vanity.
3739 2018-05-03 15:47:07 When everybody else in the country complaining about gas being high Louisiana and Texas ppl chilling because that mean the oil industry booming 
3740 2018-05-03 15:47:05 It's like a sugar sector stock somuch consumptions but always depend on oil and sugar is on rain but tomorrow all three stock jet ,spice ,indigo can be bought for next one year with 100 % return as in my view crude will struggle to close above 76.5 $/bbl and sl tomorrow low
3741 2018-05-03 15:46:50 @VelshiRuhle  please, please stop broadcasting this snake oil salesman. Trump talking about God and faith, is like well, it's just disgusting.

3743 2018-05-03 15:46:38 nope your boy Caggulia got all the icetime and he is brutal. 5th left hand shot on the PP, when slep and JP are right handed and shoot much better.  And dont say earn ice time because caggulia did not. Worried about losing Cag for nothing, + by -, oil just lost the better asset.

3748 2018-05-03 15:46:26 this batch of cannabis oil i made with MCT oil is weak as hell and idk why. could be my leftover herb wasn't strong enough or could be my tolerance or could be the oil doesn't work as well as straight coconut
3749 2018-05-03 15:46:16 With our vast mineral resources and cruide oil, every Nigerian deserve a good living, but unfortunately our leaders doesn't have hearts.

3755 2018-05-03 15:45:31 Would engine oil work? I don't understand why oil would be helpful for shoes in the first place, but I trust my dad veezavee shoes, and it works for engines, so I'm open to it! What is the best brand of engine oil?

3759 2018-05-03 15:45:11 Yes I've tried CBD oil and cream with limited results, the problem is if I use those I break my contract with pain clinic not to mention the results aren't nearly enough to use as a substitute. So you can see the frustration.
3760 2018-05-03 15:45:11 I’m going to tell you what Pashay told me, put on some baby oil. 
3761 2018-05-03 15:45:07 I now so badly want to be the first Saudi Minister of Olive Oil! The barrel price is sooooo high, I assure you.
3762 2018-05-03 15:44:53 also this lucidol hair oil that Z hyped about is really nice i love the smell and so much BETTER than loreal's
3763 2018-05-03 15:44:24 Blocked because if a scientific discovery  is made it stands in the way of oil production and trumps oil company won't make money

3765 2018-05-03 15:44:03 So here I am minding my own damn business getting my oil changed, watching pawn stars and this old man has the audacity to come and take the remote from me. Like somehow because you’re an ancient man creature you deserve total remote control. Fuck you.

3775 2018-05-03 15:43:18 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
3776 2018-05-03 15:43:18 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3777 2018-05-03 15:43:09 apa daya aku yang gapunya doi dan kalo mau beli oil paper 1 aja harus mikir dulu uangnya mending buat beli itu atau makan. hm miris
3778 2018-05-03 15:43:05 I really appreciate your concern & the advice.  In general, I’m just not comfortable with holistic medicine or CBD oil usage in animals, mostly because there’s a lack of extensive testing. It stinks & I wish they’d get on with it, I know there are benefits.
3779 2018-05-03 15:42:56 Seriously??!!  Sometimes I think the OilKings have a list of players that I really like that they refer to when making stupid trades (no offense intended to the new Oil King players).  First @nickbowman919 and now @kobemohr .  I'm afraid to look at what's next....

3785 2018-05-03 15:42:30 New mattress led to sudden sciatic nerve pinch and back pain from hell. It was so bad yesterday that I couldn't sit up. Advil and Aleve didn't help. My mom brought over some CBD oil. I was skeptical, but holy hell, it worked. I can actually move today. 
3786 2018-05-03 15:42:14 We have to use the oil pipelines for water.

3791 2018-05-03 15:41:37 That said, I’ll be voting against all the GOP in the general even though it won’t matter. Thankfully, I also live in the city which is controlled by progressives & center Dems. The city & county are like oil & vinegar here. Two completely different mindsets.
3792 2018-05-03 15:41:28 The oil we don't know how many barrels we explore daily. Okay Continue!
3793 2018-05-03 15:41:25 The greatest resource we have in this country today is not oil but Human resource.

3795 2018-05-03 15:40:54 ‘Rapeseed (also known as oilseed rape) is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed. It is the third-largest source of vegetable oil in the world’ (Gerrard, 2018) 
3796 2018-05-03 15:40:51 So i assume you quietly celebrated when Fort Mac burned down. People like you are the problem in Canada. Go inform yourself on our  Canadian oil resources you hack. #KinderMorgan #Approved
3797 2018-05-03 15:40:46 #CBC 
Trump ended the oil wars with possible world peace thanks to energy independence and avoided a nuclear war with N. Korea and soon Iran will be part of world peace all thanks to Donald Trump. 
But you libs are so full of hate you would rather we evaporated in a nuclear war.
3798 2018-05-03 15:40:44 Ultimately Cris, my immediate suggestion is to ask if you've thought about CBD oil, if for nothing else, just to rule it out. 

Long term, I believe our biggest issue is the lack of personal care in our personal care.

3800 2018-05-03 15:40:34 is there a harm-minimizing optimal source of fish oil? The evidence for an IQ-fish oil supplement relationship is pretty strong.
3801 2018-05-03 15:40:30 Whit? The currency wasn't even the same! How many guineas per barrel oil then?
3802 2018-05-03 15:40:30 Lowest black and Hispanic unemployment in HISTORY.  Jobs everywhere, 2nd in the world in oil production. To name a few things he's done. Obama said I can't pull jobs out of thin air. If Trump found a cure for cancer, you would put him down for putting people out of work!

3819 2018-05-03 15:38:00 You have to wonder if some of these ICE'd cases are delibrate? We have all come across oil drivers who have a strong disliking for electric cars. There is a small number of hard core anti-electric people out there who hate electric cars with passion.
3820 2018-05-03 15:37:51 I will be attacked for agreeing completely with you. As a Country, we only see #Oil and #Terrorism in Middle East. We forget that these Cultures have existed long before we became a #Nation. 
We must take responsibility for not helping but making things worse.
3821 2018-05-03 15:37:41 In hiding behind the Official Secrets Act McCrone actually concedes the report was NOT public, e.g. it had to be unearthed by an FOI!. Whilst oil revenues fluctuate that does not diminish the case for independence

3835 2018-05-03 15:35:26 If the development model is state capitalism funded by resource extraction, then LA states are still beholden to capitalism. For example: the oil boom built a degree of middle class wealth in Ecuador, but it was squandered on corruption, Coca-Cola, and Calvin Klein.

3852 2018-05-03 15:33:19 The Oil Kings have traded Nick Bowman with a 6th round pick to Moose Jaw for Vince Loschiavo.  They also deal Kobe Mohr to Kamloops for Quinn Benjafield and a conditional 2020 4th round pick.

3858 2018-05-03 15:32:26 If you are concerned about the Fraser then better let NDP know their KM debacle is endangering the Fraser runs because of increased oil transfer by rail. One derailment and the Fraser runs could  be lost forever. Idiots like Green Elizabeth May prefer rail to KM

Alright cya!
3870 2018-05-03 15:30:52 The thing is higher oil prices will help kick oil addiction for consumers also at a faster pace. $4+ gasoline will definitely lead to faster adoption of EVs. Interesting to watch how it balances out.

3875 2018-05-03 15:30:33 Mel, you're missing the changes to the oil sanctions which now allow Iran to sell 1mil barrels more per day.   1 million barrels per day more than before the deal.
At $70 per barrel, thats $70 mil per day.  Thats over $25 bil a year at todays prices, for as long as they have oil.

3882 2018-05-03 15:29:52 Thought I was going to get a regular oil change today but nope 
3883 2018-05-03 15:29:43 I have the break out of the century on my chin right now. Sounds scary to use oil with it, but worth a shot
3884 2018-05-03 15:29:42 Who did the Oil sign?
3885 2018-05-03 15:29:34 They are trying to spin it, but without a doubt Big Oil is behind it in some way. Killings like this happens all the time down there.
3886 2018-05-03 15:29:24 You should get an oil change before your engine blows up.
3887 2018-05-03 15:29:18 Once said "Rise of petrol prices means failure of government", so said when one Barrell crude oil is 120$, but what now modi ji, how will you suppose to appreciate this time, petrol price 79, when barrell crude oil is just 72$ @RahulGandhi @dpradhanbjp @arunjaitley

3892 2018-05-03 15:28:27 what like @sams_usa linked with the muslim brotherhood, or with @TheSyriaCmpgn funded by Ayman Asfari, a billionaire uK Srian in the oil and gas industry. who wouldnt mind being in power in Syria. you mean like them?
3893 2018-05-03 15:28:22 .@planetmoney LOVE the Indicator series on California. Some on Texas would be awesome too, since the general perception of TX is of an oil state.
3894 2018-05-03 15:28:10 Weir says its a false allegation meant to punish him for wanting to talk about applying the carbon tax to imported oil.  Singh says he was expelled for being a close-talker who cannot read minds.  Neither explanation looks good on the NDP.

3911 2018-05-03 15:26:24 If smaller govt gives us Flint, Michigan...which under Trump still is not fixed...then give me big govt with regulations up the arse! 

I see what's being poured into Colorado's aquifer and it's nothing like the propaganda the oil companies are putting in commercials.

3924 2018-05-03 15:25:15 A bit confusing ('official reserves' ↓ while Brent price ↑) UNTIL one realizes that "reserves" refers to $$ not oil ... (conditioned reflex: 'reserves' = 'oil reserves')
3925 2018-05-03 15:25:09 Significant policy not to take paid work from the oil industry. This had been discussed for some time.
3926 2018-05-03 15:25:03 Does anyone know a skin regimen to get motor oil and shit out of your pores? I love my new job but even after I shower and really scrub with a loofah/exfoliation rag I can't seem to get all of it. My face is easy but it seems to stick everywhere else.
3927 2018-05-03 15:24:56 Screw you! You're so into destroying our parks & selling off millions of acres to mining, oil, hunting, drilling, lumber & fishing organizations you wouldn't care if our parks vanished completely. And if TRUMP'S a "builder," tell him to stick to cities. Stay away from our parks!

3934 2018-05-03 15:24:02 Now CNQ, in tandem with CVE, will cut production due to egress constraints. Where does that fit into the global production estimates?  Add to this the fact it is heavy crude, and the global oil complex becomes all the more acutely constrained. If rail is the solution, that's +$.

3954 2018-05-03 15:20:55 Exactly. 

Remember that trump has exclaimed numerous times that the United States should have taken Iran’s oil.  I think this is an attempt by Netanyahu and Trump to pull a Bush 2.0 wmd and attempt seizure of Iran’s oil even though illegal.

3974 2018-05-03 15:18:33 Oil and gas prices expected to stay high, yet SUV and truck sales, which are more profitable for car companies, are increasing due to fuel economy. However, the Trump admin wants to roll back fuel economy standards. Who is fighting for this?
3975 2018-05-03 15:18:23 No I am not brushing it off Louis. Depreciated lira would increase the prices (expensive oil etc), but would boost the exports too. If you are in the exports sector, you would benefit from the depreciated lira. If you are in the govt sector, it’s unlikely you will gain.

To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.

3999 2018-05-03 15:14:48 With their second pick in the first round (20th overall) the Oil Kings select defenceman Keegan Slaney from Airdire. Slaney had 13 goals and 36 points in 35 games in the Alberta bantam league.
4000 2018-05-03 15:14:39 Nothing like a good ole vichy shower then slathering coconut oil all over yourself...
4001 2018-05-03 15:14:30 But Ari is right on something like oil. If you push too far something breaks. Marginal cost of production, demand elasticity, incentivizing more expensive extraction means (deepwater, fracking, oil sands) all come into play.

4019 2018-05-03 15:12:03 I have noticed a lot of products no longer have palm oil which is brilliant- we have so many better plant oils produced closer to home so fewer food miles too!
4020 2018-05-03 15:11:51 What is off day?..when u have to take  your car for a oil change and errands blah blah mannn I get zero relaxation day
4021 2018-05-03 15:11:49 If you cut it up small and fry it in a fry pan with a little olive oil, it’s good. 

Seriously though, it’s one of the few foods I can eat and not feel sick.
4022 2018-05-03 15:11:43 use chopsticks more when cooking. They’re especially great to move bacon around easily on the pan and still keep a safe distance from hot oil splatter.
4023 2018-05-03 15:11:34 Aku dah lama usyar kora organics ni tapi dia mahal cam diperbuat di surga walaupun face oil dia dah out of stock kat sephora dan tyra kmrzmn ni dapat free centu je 
4024 2018-05-03 15:11:11 That's nice. The extra taste is bcoz of frying in coconut oil. But you can't store it for long. In Malayalam we say kaari poyakkum. எண்ணெய் வாடை வந்துடும். Next time ask them to try tapioca chips. Very tasty.

-India pays $ to Venezuela & receives petros. (Who else would sell the petros?)

-India pays petros to Venezuela & receives oil

-Venezuela is like “look, see, petro is a real thing, you can really use it to buy oil.”

4060 2018-05-03 15:07:01 Oil prices fell early this morning, pulled down by a rise in U.S. crude inventories and record weekly U.S. production!
4061 2018-05-03 15:07:00 In 2013, 450 tankers used the straight of, “Jaun de fuca”, and the traffic has only increased. That’s 1.23 oil tankers daily... without incident. Ps, you have been nothing but civil, and I appreciate and applaud it.
4062 2018-05-03 15:06:54 It means tourism is much more valuable than a pipeline,$25,000,000. per yr. pipeline or $15,000,000,000, per year tourism in jeopardy from a oil spill.That is billion with a b for tourism.Pipelines don’t make cents and they provide BC very few jobs...

4067 2018-05-03 15:06:38 Article written by a true socialist, the writers tone is essentially screw the 82% that are starving to death they don't matter, what needs to be focused on is that it has oil and America wants it.

4072 2018-05-03 15:06:15 The overwhelming majority of BC Natives on the KM Pipeline Twinning route are in favour & want the jobs & benefits. Those Natives not involved are addicted to bitching & TV Cameras. It’s laughable Ont natives are opposing pipelines while they enjoy Foreign Oil/Gas Unbelievable 
4073 2018-05-03 15:06:07 Sorry mate but your position on this is untenable... “Most people” in BC disagree with you and your illegal behaviour. I don't know a single person who opposes it. I know some who question bitumen oil, but not the pipeline. Go away!
4074 2018-05-03 15:06:05 U.S. shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources says has no problems with takeaway capacity from its Permian wells for oil or gas. "We have extensive firm transport agreements for oil and gas," CEO Tim Dove says

4084 2018-05-03 15:04:55 same oil one... :)
4085 2018-05-03 15:04:52 I was discussing with a friend whether or not Jesus and His disciples ever told jokes and if so what kind. ...so now I'm formulating a punch line to the question, "how many Romans does it take to change the wick in an oil lamp?"
4086 2018-05-03 15:04:52 Ooh, any recommendations? We use a combination of Sunday Riley/Keihls/Origins primarily, with a smattering of other stuff.

I actually bought some rosehip oil after you had tweeted about it a while back. I've been using it after shaving & as a night mask - works pretty good!
4087 2018-05-03 15:04:40 Have you tried rubbing oil all over your skin?
4088 2018-05-03 15:04:27 Anyone have or know where I can get a pop up gazebo? Got a few events this summer and don't fancy grappling with the flimsy one I have (especially if @TwistedCider isn't there to tie it to an oil drum with baler twine for me)
4089 2018-05-03 15:04:22 Everything is politics/elections in our country.
govt says,Fuel price are de-regulated,we cannot interfere & ask companies to keep price under control. 
On other hand, hv asked all oil companies to freeze price,till karnataka elections.
Now thy hv control on oil co. fr votebank
4090 2018-05-03 15:04:12 Not a good breakfast: peppermint tea + fish oil supplement.
4091 2018-05-03 15:04:09 What did Andrew Napolitano think in 2014 when oil was heading to $25 & Giuliani & Peters on Fox News endorsed Putin’s “decisive leadership” in the Ukraine over their own President Obama? What did the FBI, Comey & Mueller think? And what were elected R’s capable of re: Russia?
4092 2018-05-03 15:03:59 Look at what palm oil is added to. Peanut butter?? Tortillas?? Pita bread?? These products can be made sans any oil and some companies are already catching up with it. If we start eating truly whole foods plant based diet and choose ethical products, there will be no conundrum.
4093 2018-05-03 15:03:47 Where does most of the oil come from?
4094 2018-05-03 15:03:26 Me: Mam I can’t open this tube of bloody primrose oil tablets

4105 2018-05-03 15:01:58 That's why I also said (in this piece) - "While oil’s short-term trend is still up for now, and I believe in respecting the trend, there is a very real risk that another violent liquidation sell-off may occur when the trend changes.”

4107 2018-05-03 15:01:51 This govt announced that poor people will get gas connections free in this yojna , but sorry to say that here too this govt cheated the poor as oil companies r now recovering the amount from their subsidy
4108 2018-05-03 15:01:50 My doctor told me to try CBD oil so if anyone has any reputable sites or stores they buy from let me know!
4109 2018-05-03 15:01:44 De range van CO2-prijzen waarin gas echt wint van kolen én renewables is vermoedelijk juist vrij gering. Slippery slope voor de oil majors. De gok was/is wellicht dat dat er internationaal voorlopig toch niet van komt. Ondertussen doet het wonderen voor de beeldvorming. ;-)

4141 2018-05-03 14:57:57 You're wrong. I was referring to price manipulation, but I was not comparing it to commodities such oil or copper.
4142 2018-05-03 14:57:45 Getting a oil change and they but not come back saying shit else wrong
4143 2018-05-03 14:57:44 It's hot enough outside that you don't have to wear lotion.. Instead, just let the oil from a bad diet rise thru ya pores.
4144 2018-05-03 14:57:42 Questions: Does the Fezzan region really want fighting to end? What does the #Fezzan really want re statehood or a part of the UN created Libya? Do the various tribes believe in constitutions, institutions etc? How do they feel about the oil and its wealth per distribution?
4145 2018-05-03 14:57:39 So how did a former bus driver become El Presidente?
Might Russia have been involved?

Venezuela has reefs of oil underground ... and no brains at the top to manage an economy w/natural resources
4146 2018-05-03 14:57:34 Indeed, a great and wondrous mystery. Although, in Eric's defense, I have seen him and his brother discuss rent seeking enough times that I suspect he's aware of the havoc wrought by rendering the dollar a currency backed by oil futures, fractional-reserves, nukes, and a prayer.

4159 2018-05-03 14:56:13 Like, they buried a story about how a trade war would destroy crop prices, which should have been front page news given that we’re in fucking farm country.
4160 2018-05-03 14:56:10 But let's dig deeper. You seem to be comparing Bitcoin to commodities. Ok. Compared to gold, Bitcoin is much harder to manipulate over any longer-term periods. Compared to oil, let's say, I agree with your statement.

4175 2018-05-03 14:54:45 @CapEconEmerging • Saudi Arabia’s ‘whole economy’ PMI – which covers entire non-oil private sector – fell for 2nd consecutive month from 52.8 in March to fresh record low of 51.8 in April. The deterioration in economic conditions came despite the rally in oil prices last month.

4225 2018-05-03 14:49:06 Ok now I feel like the trader who said oil would be $300, then deleted the tweets...he could hit 100, I think a smaller total is more likely+he has a knack for building bridges in a way his rivals could struggle with, will put him in good stead for the months long govt formation

4238 2018-05-03 14:48:07 No one believes what you say. The US will be forced out of Syria. Russia and Iran will control the region and Syria will give Russia oil, pipelines and military bases. Iran and Lebanon will push Israel back to the 1967 borders and stop the IDF from killing Palestinian children.
4239 2018-05-03 14:47:54 It’s amazing how millions of US$ flow freely into pipeline protest organizations pockets, yet our  oil isn’t allowed to flow freely to the world market, forcing us to sell it to USA at deep discounts, harming our economy to the tune of billions #KinderMorgan #bcndp

4245 2018-05-03 14:46:40 Don’t forget heating oil tanks as well. Fuel being lighter than water will float so make sure the tank supply line is closed off. Ideally the tank should be strapped to the house to keep from tipping over or floating away and ripping the line away from the house.
4246 2018-05-03 14:46:38 Out getting just an oil change and only an oil change  but you know that’s not always how it goes

Wipers, oil change, coolant, a fog light... all that is like $200
4248 2018-05-03 14:46:28 i use wheat germ oil and coconut oil mixed together and then i use one of those cellulite remover brushes to get the oils in
4249 2018-05-03 14:46:24 i use aztec indian healing clay, tea tree oil for spot treatments & moisturize with coconut & rosehip seed oil.

4257 2018-05-03 14:45:40 It is monthly data in desperate need of smoothing. Also we have really bought into the doctrine the trade deficits are bad. Foreigners give us goods and services and we give them pieces of paper IOUs. Without huge foreign investment our oil sands would be lying dormant

4259 2018-05-03 14:45:28 This goes here as well, I like myself from "Old time vanilla" flavor because contains less motor oil. :P

But yeah, gotta love what chemicals can do again.  Or, this could be grim signs of where we are going.  Natural resources diminishing...
4260 2018-05-03 14:45:23 Oklahoma’s greatest natural resource is by far its fossil fuel reserves. Oil or gas strikes have been made in nearly all 77 Oklahoma counties since 1905! #EcologyofNaturalResources

4267 2018-05-03 14:44:56 Look closely at those tech jobs. It is advancements in automation, efficiency and environmental controls in the resources that drives much of the tech industry. The oil/gas industry is one of the most tech advanced industries in Canada.
4268 2018-05-03 14:44:47 Six years ago, state Rep. Vitali (D) made the first attempt to impose a severance tax on oil and gas companies extracting natural gas from Pennsylvania’s bedrock.

Since then, 66 attempts by Pennsylvania lawmakers to impose a fee or severance tax have been made with no results.

4341 2018-05-03 14:37:33 This is true, but a huge reasoning is purely down to the fact that so many assets are priced in usd. If we start to see assets be priced in Yuan for example (like the new oil contract) we could see a gradual shift, especially if confidence is lost in the Fed.

4377 2018-05-03 14:33:27 I feed my parrots palm fruit oil, it’s not easy finding one that is ethical. But never ever buy from Indonesia area. I try to find organic from South America.
4378 2018-05-03 14:33:26 My poor degu has dry ears and I'm having to put coconut oil on them to help them heal but it's heartbreaking seeing how much he hates it 
4379 2018-05-03 14:33:25 I do steam and add essential oil for my sister. It works lah.
4380 2018-05-03 14:33:21 Hey that’s a no brainer, watch when Canada sells more oil and soft wood lumber to China . Trumps specialty is going bankrupt.
4381 2018-05-03 14:33:11 They won’t even admit Trudeau was the  #1 proponent of those giant reservation squashing oil pipelines. The denial is very thick

生姜や蜂蜜に浸けると蛋白質分解酵素の働きで柔らかくすることができますよ！

4384 2018-05-03 14:32:56 That's just plain laughable
Most of what you tweet is big oil propaganda verbatim
You don't think, you parrot
You ARE the echo chamber
4385 2018-05-03 14:32:56 as long as they dont bring them to any NRA conventions, or any events with POTUS or VPOTUS, or any events with Scott Pruitt (he’s an Oil & Gas lobbyist from Oklahoma) 

because that would be a no-no
4386 2018-05-03 14:32:39 They JUST don't get it. I don't care about Trump's sex life. Not even a little. I didn't help elect an alter boy. Where's ISIS? NK is a BIG deal. The economy. Oil, gas, regulations, tax reform, the wall. The President is a machine for MAGA!
4387 2018-05-03 14:32:35 Due to low price of oil at that time . Gas is higher than hell atm next...
4388 2018-05-03 14:32:30 Bros, the number of Port Harcourt Oil workers landing in Calgary is alarming. I can float a successful business from welcoming 9jas
4389 2018-05-03 14:32:25 I hate everything about maintenance for my car. Oil changes, tires, breaks, gas all that. I hate.
4390 2018-05-03 14:32:17 RT> Why do these red baiters not realize they're actually making "RUS trolls" seem like they're actually doing more good than harm...?

No one wants an oil pipeline running through their backyards. No one wants to be victims of eminent domain.

We want safer energy solutions...
4391 2018-05-03 14:32:17 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
4392 2018-05-03 14:32:15 I'm certain that Peak Oil was the scientific consensus... didn't work out, did it. Perhaps we should stop paying attention to people claiming their beliefs are right because of a consensus.
4393 2018-05-03 14:32:14 1/With the renewal of oil sanctions on Iran looming, some key questions - will states like India and China willingly reduce oil imports from Iran, 
and how much Iranian oil might be taken off the market? Will the Saudis replace it?
4394 2018-05-03 14:32:13 @realDonaldTrump If Israel airstrike iran, oil prices could increase to 200 $ barrel, but this not good for US

4397 2018-05-03 14:32:09 I'll consider checking it out. But if I have to judge which position is more likely influenced by money and power - granola-munching tree huggers and scientists, or a lawyer whose career has been built on big money oil - I'm probably gonna go with the latter.
4398 2018-05-03 14:32:06 I love my body butters but the oil from them keeps getting on my clothes

4401 2018-05-03 14:31:48 The poll shows the public is being duped into thinking this is about a pipeline, rather the transforming Metro Vancouver into a major oil shipping port from what it is today.! And then we'll be stuck with that decision, that risk...so long as this extension goes to Westridge!

4405 2018-05-03 14:31:11 It's a hard pill to swallow that you've been misguided by an ingeniously false interpretation. The Christ, the anointing oil, is within us all. If you follow Jesus's teachings you raise the Christ to that place called pineal and this is the resurrection and salvation.
4406 2018-05-03 14:31:09 Use shea butter face mask from innisfree! It helps a lot with my dry patches! And also use rose hip oil!

A Great-Depression-level collapse.

Due to oil & gas crashing & (secondarily) sanctions in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

4419 2018-05-03 14:30:09 I think over short term the price of oil will determine the direction of the market.

4452 2018-05-03 14:25:57 Very likely, according to AMuS, Mercedes had to revert to an older oil spec, causing a slight drop in performances. But that also means, there's a lot of room for improvement, both at Brixworth and Petronas.

He &his attorneys’ think you are gullible enough to buy the snake oil.When you vote, think of that & those who have enabled him!

4527 2018-05-03 14:18:39 It has value because it is a medium of exchange via third party transactions and because oil can generally only be purchased with U.S. dollars. Also, "money" (typically beads) is at least 40K years old and has evolved independently numerous times. The construction is based on the

I'm so proud that you're making such an effort!!
4531 2018-05-03 14:18:09 Imagine how that number will increase once we start drilling for all the oil and export that.

4534 2018-05-03 14:17:51 What if oil is the life blood of Earth & its systems and its being drained dry? What if pulling water, oil, gas, rock, tree, soil simultaneously is affecting the balance so Earth can't cool? Possible draining the aquifers is also affecting the water cycle. See book: Soil Not Oil

4563 2018-05-03 14:15:03 It is tough to say what is in our best interests.  High oil prices are good for the economy, especially in Alberta/Saskatchewan.  At the same time, gas prices hit household budgets hard and will cut into disposable income.  It was high gas prices that triggered the 2008 downturn.

4640 2018-05-03 14:07:42 Of note:  while the U.S. is exporting more crude oil (from shale oil extraction), its imports are RISING by almost 5%.  Domestic oil suppliers need to find alternatives from other sources as both US demand is growing and companies are expanding their exports.

4660 2018-05-03 14:05:04 It is rediculous here in OK. There is an oil refinery a quarter mile away from the high school, middle school, a private school, a higher education center, and it's surrounded by a residential area. Who designed this dumbass town? #ArdmoreOKisadumbasstown

4664 2018-05-03 14:04:56 Sorry, it has its uses. I'm pro truffle oil, but used properly.
4665 2018-05-03 14:04:54 Nothing like bringing your car in for an oil change when your service light comes on & being told it’s not your oil, it’s your brakes.

4675 2018-05-03 14:03:50 Off topic, but I would classify olive oil as a whole food.

4678 2018-05-03 14:03:38 So we (the US) are not only occupying Syria illegally, we are actively converting Syrian resources (oil fields) and bombing the forces of Syria’s government that are trying to reclaim Syrian land...Newsflash to my fellow Americans, this is the WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY
4679 2018-05-03 14:03:37 Sana gumana castor oil saken HAHAHA
4680 2018-05-03 14:03:37 That makes tons of sense in real life examples of adoption. I.e. digital cameras, smart phones, and even oil became much cheaper after a critical mass of people adopted them.

4686 2018-05-03 14:02:47 I put coconut oil in my hair last night and now it looks like i haven’t showered in 15 days
4687 2018-05-03 14:02:46 I've seen that! And I was quite disgusted, believing that it was oil; now I feel better. Thank you!
4688 2018-05-03 14:02:43 That’s because of poor policy in Canada. Not because of the oil sands itself.

4724 2018-05-03 13:59:55 I always ponder about the first person to eat cashews. Oil in the shell causes contact dermititis (similar to poison ivy).
So was that first person thinking "Surely this must be protecting something that tastes awesome!"?

4797 2018-05-03 13:51:06 I would love to watch Art Olympics with categories like oil painting, color pensils, charcoil, digital art, pixelart, graffiti, bodypaint etc. and with different time limits
4798 2018-05-03 13:50:59 Haha yeah. Boxes of peanuts everywhere, fries cooked in peanut oil. 
4799 2018-05-03 13:50:52 What about supplements like cod liver oil and spirulina? Can we consume it occasionally instead of regularly?

4803 2018-05-03 13:50:00 Where is your coverage on the fact that oil is up to $70 per barrel and #akleg is still attempting to steal our money?  The news is supposed to hold them accountable- Instead of reporting on the failure of SB21, you allow them to get away with stealing from Alaskans.
4804 2018-05-03 13:49:45 Black Castor Oil is a great oil for thickness and retaining length...I'd suggest some kind of conditioner as well @Young_EDgod makes some. Try to massage the area with your fingertips when you wash it and shower too. The key is retaining moisture and using products consistently.

4812 2018-05-03 13:49:26 Fact: Randy parks his car on railroad crossings when he changes his oil because he likes to live dangerous. Every time he gives himself a little bit less time so he can try to beat his old record
4813 2018-05-03 13:49:18 Oil hitting 300$ will redirect more money to renewable energies,which ultimately will make countries independent of oil. Also as laser based fusion and fission energy sources along with superconductors will be available in the following decade, oil won't be that important anymore
4814 2018-05-03 13:49:18 My coconut oil went from a solid to a liquid in 2.5 seconds tho 
4815 2018-05-03 13:49:06 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
4816 2018-05-03 13:49:05 I'm not a $TSLA bull at all but you realize that using that coal (or oil) fueled power plant argument is stupid, right? 80-90% efficient vs combustible engine of half that.

4818 2018-05-03 13:48:49 Leaving to California tonight and we haven’t even packed and I haven’t gotten an oil change.

4820 2018-05-03 13:48:32 Get the capsules, cuz the oil is yuck, but I take two once a day with a meal and that’s it, your burps taste like pizza but that’s the only “side effect” lol a nurse I work with swears by it too
4821 2018-05-03 13:48:30 Sir have heard of petro yuan as a counter to petro dollar. Can you tell how it is a game changer to crude oil prices and how will it effect india? Are we ready for this? @Swamy39
4822 2018-05-03 13:48:27 The Niger delta people especially oil producing communities  were hopeful afta the public hearing of NOSDRA amendment bill, what's going on.
4823 2018-05-03 13:48:04 The puppet master’s goal, sue oil companies for storm recovery-like big tobacco was held responsible in the end
4824 2018-05-03 13:47:56 With the cost of new production north of $80 a barrel, I'm sure #Suncor shareholders would rather receive dividends than own stranded assets. Are production cutbacks inevitable in the face of faltering economics in the oil sands?
4825 2018-05-03 13:47:49 Capitalism was going fairly well in Venezuela until they made the oil industry a public assest. Now people starve in the streets. "But it's not real socialism". Is hate to see real socialism if this is only "kinda socialism".

Now Rainforests being cleared to grow palm trees.
Palm tree oil for biofuel encouraged by short-sighted UN Climate and palm oil export to Europe and U.S. for food supplychain.

4838 2018-05-03 13:46:05 Don't 'punyeta' me, we're on the same side!  True, may only pt was may excise tax na dati gas, yes it increased due to the Train law. Diesel, new yung excise tax. The big jump is not just coz of excise tax but mostly due to the global oil price - that's my only point.
4839 2018-05-03 13:46:05 That's the face supremacists say they fear to lose? That's the philosophical equivalent to a shitroll deep fried in waste motor oil, seasoned with musk- to make it seem manly.

We are the people of AB and we can do it by ourselves. Don't need Notley. Don't need Kenney. We're able to take care
4847 2018-05-03 13:44:49 The more you know about oil refineries, the less you want to live anywhere near one.
4848 2018-05-03 13:44:37 I’m not a massive potato fan because most are too starchy but Woolies has small Nicola potatoes at the moment and oh my heavens! Garlic, rosemary, salt and olive oil roast. It’s what a potato should taste like

4868 2018-05-03 13:42:31 Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they sell a lot of oil

4870 2018-05-03 13:42:24 It is your job to hold #akleg accountable- I have seen no news stories about the fact that oil prices are up, and that in the past +$70 per barrel would bring in plenty of revenue.  This proves that SB21 is a failure and needs to be fixed.

4880 2018-05-03 13:41:42 I use Coconut oil as a lip balm. Use a lip peel from HM sometime a week at night and put on the coconut oil once every morning and at bedtime. Smooth as a baby´s bottom and rarely need to put something on during the day.

4893 2018-05-03 13:40:08 Oil prices are up- If #akleg cannot bring the state enough revenue at $70 per barrel- they are a failure and directly violating our state constitution which states they must get maximum return for our resources

4905 2018-05-03 13:39:07 historically we used to extract gas&oil from our land, consume it and export it. on those years (due to a lot of factors) we needed to import gas&oil. also had to buy electricity from neighbour countries

I don't have the heart to tell him.Even though he could be wrong, I can't neglect his good intentions. But yeah, snake oil, just that he believes it too
4920 2018-05-03 13:37:11 I'm pretty sure the smoking PUs are not because of the excess oil. Some clever mechanics going on there. 
But... Obviously the smoke is partly due to the oil. 
Will be interesting to see how Simone Resta, Rory Bryne ant Matteo Binotto combat 5he clamp down.

Neem oil relieves irritated skin with its soothing and gentle properties. It also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial components that can relieve the symptoms of conjunctivitis. Wipe neem oil around the eye and eyelid before going bed for pink eye relief.
4994 2018-05-03 13:26:26 You do realise oil prices & BP quarterly profits are not one and the same thing? Your tweet suggests you might not.... Mid June 2014, price $114.  Jan 2016 low of $27.9. Price today $72.8. Still far from rosy, and highly sketchy if you’re making a case for Indy on back of it.

My cup surely does runs over. I’m so grateful for all Your provisions this week: the food on my table, the funds I’ve needed, and the peace of mind,knowing You provide for my every need.
5066 2018-05-03 13:15:37 One race did not "decide to end the madness". The govt was bankrupt, there were sanctions, SA couldnt export or get oil, there was civil unrest Was it all these things that forced a change or did whites wake up and say "Ai, ons is so verkeerd, kom ons verander"?
5067 2018-05-03 13:15:29 @Dan_Dicker How high will the oil price go if the first strike on an oil field in the M.E. happens? Already, Syria lobbed to missiles toward the Yemen oil fields. People not holding XLE or individual oil stocks will get crushed.

5074 2018-05-03 13:14:30 I said it when he initiated coverage, $TSLA and Toni Sacconaghi are like oil and water- just is what it is- Toni does extensive work and is a value guy at heart- none of these even remotely apply to $TSLA
5075 2018-05-03 13:14:25 First, Jesus told us to love one another & treat one as we want to be treated...if you're angry you can't keep this commandment because no one shows love out of anger it is impossible, it is like mixing water & oil. I believe that when we are angry we are sinning against god!
5076 2018-05-03 13:14:13 Who could have seen this coming?  A failed steak salesman-snake oil huckster-phony college Dean....he was never going to turn the corner and be a decent leader.  Let’s cut our losses.  Impeachment or Article 25...whichever’s quicker.

5095 2018-05-03 13:11:33 It's a spectrum rather than absolutes, right? I think they both felt they could leave the world a better place with their tech. Contrast with, say, someone who founds a company in Wall Street or in oil (Koch brothers?) who are in it pretty much only for the money.

5146 2018-05-03 13:05:43 That’s fun to say, but recent history; Desert Storm, OEF, OIF, Lybia, show that oil prices were only temporarily effected.  Sure, an Arab v Persian War would cause a giant spike, but such a conflict isn’t likely. Even still, it wouldn’t last very long at all.

5210 2018-05-03 12:59:35 Thanks Sipher...My word of the day. Definition of oleaginous. 1 : resembling or having the properties of oil : oily; also : containing or producing oil. 2 : marked by an offensively ingratiating manner or quality.

5227 2018-05-03 12:57:41 It’s for show. The Syrian bombing was done a week after the Syrians were already told that area would be bombed. The Iran deal is actually good for Russia given it means less chance of them importing irradiated oil.

5339 2018-05-03 12:44:32 He revealed Trump knew, the path to campaign violation is open in other ways. Economy? Obama did it. NK? Kim is playing Trumpo. Oil? Obama. Isis? Obama. Peace? Kim plays Trumpo. Release of 3 citizens? Good. FBI spying? It's their job -- with FISA. MSM is reporting--you're deaf.

5341 2018-05-03 12:44:13 No onions. Open Chilli cheese toasts. Butter bread (though I brush some rosemary olive oil) - top with mozzarella & cheddar, chopped chilies, parsley (or herb of your choice) & bake in a preheated oven at 180 degrees C for 10 mins (or till bread has crisped & cheese has melted)
5342 2018-05-03 12:44:12 Yeah I don't deep fry but I'll do up some potatoes in a deep pan sometimes. Bare minimum oil required.
5343 2018-05-03 12:44:11 Well I guess then Scotland is going to be delighted to know they are not part of the UK. Now they can stop paying UK taxes and letting their assets (Oil?) being used at UK benefit.  And maybe the UK can give back the national heirlooms they are “protecting.”
5344 2018-05-03 12:44:05 Well there goes that middle class tax cut straight to big oil.  Thanks @GOP
5345 2018-05-03 12:43:52 I thought the North Dakota oil was going to keep oil/gas prices low

5349 2018-05-03 12:43:42 Quoting @mgualtieri: “I disagree with the notion that data is the new oil. It’s as infinite as the sun, and just like the power of the sun, we’re barely using it at the moment.”

5354 2018-05-03 12:43:06 It is. But I am scared. Always imagine I am seconds away of a fire inferno in my kitchen. So I don’t do deep fry things. Only a view drops of oil.
5355 2018-05-03 12:43:01 "Shale" oil break even price depends on the basin, rocks, fluid quality, and other parameters. In general, the potential for application of Artificial Intelligence is fairly limited. There seems to be a tendency to quote investment bankers on issues they know very little about.
5356 2018-05-03 12:42:49 Cheryl, You prefer killing foreign Gays?  Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. The world needs more of Canada’s Gay friendly Oil & Natural Gas. @vancouverpride

5361 2018-05-03 12:42:36 I'd like to see the police officer who took one look at the complaint and decided that interviewing Linda Bellos under caution was the correct response. 

Loonies will always loony. I'd like state employed law enforcement officers to have more 'oil in their lamps'.
5362 2018-05-03 12:42:34 TFW You wake up remembering you started stripping at Lucas oil last night.
5363 2018-05-03 12:42:30 This looks like it should be an oil painting. Something really perfect about all the details.
5364 2018-05-03 12:42:23 Sunflowers (WS Brdlf) work Grrrreat as 1component in diverse mix. Your native soils had warm season brdlf plants, w/oil, all over before man cleared them. Greater plant diversity in your off season (non-cash crop) =faster soil functionality. Reduces non-wetting issues increase OM

Peace in Koreas, release of 3 us citizens from NK? Fbi Spying on a US citizen.Oh wait I don’t think the msm is reporting this. Turn channel
5368 2018-05-03 12:42:01 Everything I Google “is xx good/bad for dogs?” 

Mine once grabbed a bottle of Aragon oil for hair & we couldn’t determine how much was spilled vs licked up.
5369 2018-05-03 12:41:53 I was so naive when i considered Al-Sisi taking over in #Egypt as a step forward.. Egypt is in a very bad shape thanks to the Gulf monarchies and their Oil money!
5370 2018-05-03 12:41:43 Isn’t that the problem with most Labour voters? Going by headlines without details &blind faith that #Corbyn is telling truth. He still advocates Venezuela style economics when a country with largest oil reserves is now bankrupt. Read about Labour’s IT project, billions sunk etc

5387 2018-05-03 12:40:23 I like to put just a little white truffle oil in my develed eggs. Its delish!. I don't care for black truffels.

5396 2018-05-03 12:39:44 Nah, truffle oil would overwhelm rock, paper, and scissors. If you love it, just put it on bread, because you ain't going to taste anything else anyway!

5402 2018-05-03 12:38:49 You are under the mistaken impression that increasing oil production is a desirable thing.
5403 2018-05-03 12:38:29 It's definitely the muzzie influence
all the oil money
I don't mind other cultural influences but their standards/morals/ethics are inferior, so is their logic...mohammed COPIED the good parts of monotheism and made the rest up to suit his need for power and control.

5413 2018-05-03 12:37:21 Maybe it’s God that blessed Nigerians with Buhari and Blessed Buhari with Nigeria’s oil money so he can maintain himself
5414 2018-05-03 12:37:02 It is more than that.  There seems to exist a coterie of mutually adoring, genuflecting sycophants, who are impervious to contra-perspective or genuinely objective comment, and who substitute knowledge for snake oil.
5415 2018-05-03 12:37:02 Thank you for taking this seriously and I hope you will act quickly as time is of the essence.  But maybe a better answer would be to eliminate palm oil entirely from your products.
5416 2018-05-03 12:36:58 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings.

5430 2018-05-03 12:35:08 These problems are all manufactured, it's called social engineering by the New World Order. The rulers are redrawing the maps for the Petrodollar's survival. Oil and profits, power and control are more important human dignity and morality-- cannot make money with these.
5431 2018-05-03 12:35:05 But why the secrecy from western nations and their media. West Papua is being decimated by land clearing for palm oil plantations as well as mining now. Journalists should hang their heads in shame.

5456 2018-05-03 12:31:26 Yeah it’s much better to use ‘sustainably sourced’ but as you say, it’s hard to track. We need to ask producers and big brands that we want accountable and sustainably-sources palm oil.

5478 2018-05-03 12:29:17 trump is telling the truth, global warming doesn't exist and we won't run out of 'fossil fuels' aka oil and coal. Its all a FACADE. Demonic doings of the Rockefellers
5479 2018-05-03 12:29:09 Seriously, the US government should mind his own business. They look so thirsty for oil. Guys you need to chill!
5480 2018-05-03 12:29:03 Don’t forget the upturn in oil prices.
5481 2018-05-03 12:29:03 Bio fuels endanger big oil. Renewable energy is the future and there are those that will fight to keep the status quo. (And the cash flow)

5483 2018-05-03 12:28:49 Total imports 2011 were 571.3 which dropped to 465.1 in 2015 = 106.2 drop

Oil imports went from 144.3 to 112.7 in the same period = 33.6 drop

So - in answer to your question - about a third of it (ish).

I guess Indians are making more stuff at home that they used to import?

5489 2018-05-03 12:27:25 Your face and the hotspots like under your arms and your vag can be dried off. Leave the parts that are actual skin damp. It helps for the oil to soak in and seals in the moisture.
5490 2018-05-03 12:27:22 I’m still trying to figure out wtf they poured on her in the video. Coconut oil? Vegetable oil? Lube??
5491 2018-05-03 12:26:58 Took away healthcare from millions, taking away protections for #LGBTQ, taking away voting rights, killing the environment, making the rich richer, added a trillion dollars to the deficits, anti-women’s rights, opening up oil drilling and mining in our national parks,
5492 2018-05-03 12:26:56 Thos for me is the reason for lost wars being started and of course the oil money we can’t have you sell us oil how dare you try build you economy on your own natural resource tut tut,its why USA killed of Mohammad Mossadegh how dare he nationalise Iran’s oil to build his country

5502 2018-05-03 12:25:56 Oh, just remembered that one can swipe with oil after a cleaning rinse and bake for a few minutes! And you toh have an oven

5507 2018-05-03 12:25:23 Funny! I remember RT accused activists who have boarded a Russian oil rig of doing it on behalf of Western energy corporations!
5508 2018-05-03 12:25:06 Instead of burning the midnight oil and staying up late to finish something, try going to sleep early and wake up earlier to get it done. I’ve accomplished more in a couple of hours early this morning than I would have with twice that time over the night.
5509 2018-05-03 12:24:57 Will take some time for crude fall to impact local prices, oil cos typicall stock 15 days crude, so till they consume current crude at old prices, would not expect local prices to fall
5510 2018-05-03 12:24:51 How thick are you??? You’re actually trying to suggest that the UK situation prior to finding oil is equivalent to the current situation!!
Get with the times you moron, Scotland isn’t keeping the UK afloat by its oil as you seem to think

5514 2018-05-03 12:24:16 Dumber analogy. If the problem (oil change) is already obvious, anybody could have been a mechanic and fixed it. We went through Bruce Rioch after Graham before Wenger came in. Not only we needed a new mechanic, we needed one who actually knew what had to be done.

5533 2018-05-03 12:21:42 The best thing you can do is “baze,” don’t dry off and then apply oil all over your body. I personally like almond oil, but there are other options. I only add lotion if I want an added fragrance...

5626 2018-05-03 12:09:07    Nigeria only has a stable forex market at the moment due to the rise and present stability in crude prices. On top of that we have no focused economic plan presently. Better pray volatility does not return to the oil markets and FPI's don't punish us like 3 years ago.

5889 2018-05-03 11:28:17 I'm looking for this "Oil your titties and send it to him" tweet.

5893 2018-05-03 11:27:35 Must do the same about other mineral resources. Diamond, gold, oil... American, French and British lobbyists are the reason Africa has deadly unnecessary wars. Sudan, Somalia, Niger, Mali... All paying the price of having them. This companies are so heartless.
5894 2018-05-03 11:27:33 To dump in case we go back on our word. This is something that probably won’t get resolved for a long time until oil doesn’t get priced in dollars or when the dollar stops being the world reserve currency.

5896 2018-05-03 11:27:20 Hahhaahh RT @POETICandFUNNY: I have so much oil on my face US consulate would give me Visa without any question.
5897 2018-05-03 11:27:18 Just saw MIDNIGHT OIL 1984. A cracking concert film that drops you into the centre of sweaty pub gigs, and nuclear tension. So impressed by the quality of the live sound!

5899 2018-05-03 11:26:56 Ya no shit, most sunscreens also cause cancer. That's why I use organic coconut oil, every day! B

5901 2018-05-03 11:26:44 Is it because of your olive oil and vinegar business?!

5906 2018-05-03 11:25:56 I hope the court is successful. They are in a hard spot against the Saudis b/c we made a deal way back when they agreed to price oil in dollars (petrodollar) in return for their “safety” against other countries. They also hold US treasuries (our debt) that they have threatened
5907 2018-05-03 11:25:48 Foreign & multinational companies in USA had invested $billions since 2008 to export our energy. Obama lifted oil embargo 1/2016. 

Without being hamstrung by Russia investigation, a USA-first  President would’ve blocked China, Saudis& their pals from exporting our energy future
5908 2018-05-03 11:25:48 Stupidest fucking racism of the year.  BinLadin oil, FYI for the court, funded 09/11, and is a state backed Saudi oil company.  And yes, the titular Bin Ladin from the Saudi oil company family is the same one.  So this is codifying Shia Genocide, blaming all Sunni crimes on them.
5909 2018-05-03 11:25:47 Govt To Spend GH¢453m Oil Money On Free SHS This Year .... Good move
5910 2018-05-03 11:25:43 Oil price seems to have a direcr correlation to crypto market cap. Oil usually leads into a bull market in traditional stocks so maybe crypto as well.
5911 2018-05-03 11:25:37 Yeah, me too.

5914 2018-05-03 11:25:01 Put eggs, oil, and vinegar in cake batter and people are fine with it. Put mayonnaise in cake batter and they act disgusted. What do they think mayo is made of? Unicorn puree?
5915 2018-05-03 11:24:39 With this car we won’t need to rely on oil anymore...

5919 2018-05-03 11:23:53 Is this an harbinger that oil will be falling?
5920 2018-05-03 11:23:45 P.S. Post-Trump election, the Russia investigation & sanctions have been all about money:  

so Big Oil could continue to export our nonrenewable fuels—while also appropriating Russia’s oil/NG markets.

5942 2018-05-03 11:20:06 The price isn’t going to get near $100, and even if it did, the only crisis would be how does the US oil patch find enough employees for all of the jobs available. This is manufactured fear mongering.

I suspect you are one of those angry brit nats that thinks you subsidise us.
5950 2018-05-03 11:18:37 At $75.00 per barrel, gas is now just as expensive ($1.41/litre) as it was when oil was $140.00 per barrel a few years back.  Someone is doing well and it's not the consumer.
5951 2018-05-03 11:18:33 There are so many processed foods that contain Palm oil. They are cheap and taste good in Japan.The poor could not dispense with them.

- have always found homeopathic Arnica an exception and very effective against bruising
- some things that come through the system (such as anti-depressants) seem like snake oil just the same.
6011 2018-05-03 11:09:29 2) Governments have the power to mitigate the impacts of a changeover, but big oil has it's influence well and truly buried in government decisions.

3. You do realise that Britain would be a 'shithole' if it wasn't for their colonial past.

6173 2018-05-03 10:43:43 There’s no way battenberg 1975 had palm oil in it for starters. Mostly though it was a spring or fruitcake made by a family member. Out of eggs, flour, butter...

6181 2018-05-03 10:43:02 Canola oil is actually rapeseed oil but the name was changed in Canada for marketing reasons #fact

6183 2018-05-03 10:42:51  Poor doctor with no knowledge of oil,gas and rigs is a director of ONGC. Don't know what value can he add apart from hefty remuneration. That's why the country is going to the dogs.
6184 2018-05-03 10:42:49 Pilot Oil strikes again.
6185 2018-05-03 10:42:36 We export crude oil and leather. Your president is still signing MOU in 21st century to still import finished products in exchange for weapon to still empower Bokoharam and herdsmen.

How long will the slavery continue?
6186 2018-05-03 10:42:36 Maitama Sule became Oil Minister at the age of 29. Audu Ogbeh was a Minister at the age of 35. He is still serving today as a minister. So where did Nigeria go wrong and started this old politician syndrome?
6187 2018-05-03 10:42:28 And yeah, no treatment that works (lots of snake oil or actually harmful treatments though) and definitely no cure - unless you need the diagnosis for welfare or carer help it is pointless, basically a medical label for "we have NFI"

BLAME US.
6214 2018-05-03 10:39:05 Maybe not lotion, but more of a oil? Something that coats the feathers in a UV resistant oil that can be washed off later? I imagine if it was a UV resistant oil it would give the individual using it that rainbow shimmer effect oil has.
6215 2018-05-03 10:38:40 Pls Am not defending Baba o. I only reacted to what he said. But realistically, most oil producing countries lost jobs especially those that the GDP mostly depend on oil. PMB was only ice on the cake that determines how many jobs were going to be lost .
6216 2018-05-03 10:38:36 if you replace palm oil with fish oil? Definitely ;-)

Because of all the discussion like this last year.

6284 2018-05-03 10:23:09 #Ghana #marketupdate: performance improved in 2017, macroeconomic conditions strengthened. Growth increased due to expanded oil production; inflation declined; the fiscal deficit was significantly reduced, leading to a primary surplus for the first time in fifteen years...
6285 2018-05-03 10:22:54 After 1973 UK growth rates averaged 2.5% for 20 years, less than previously, but EEC 6 growth rates fell behind even the UK rates, which makes UK membership of the EEC look like a recovery. 1973 was the oil price shock.

6294 2018-05-03 10:20:56 Indeed. That is the question with which I wrestle. Suggesting to me private sector as their motivation is quarter by quarter. Water interests, Big Oil or contractors managing Directed Energy Weapons which are now a multi billion dollar real thing?

6446 2018-05-03 09:49:44 Venezuela had an economic crash because of the devaluation of oil and thier country hit rock bottom because that was thier most valuable export. It was like that five years ago. Give us free healthcare! we all pay enough in taxes that it’s easily possible.

6528 2018-05-03 09:35:20 Its also true that by the time Scotland gains independence there will be less gain from selling oil. Biggest issue likely to be remaining in the EU, the price of which may be insistence on use of the Euro.

6582 2018-05-03 09:18:44 @UKParliament Guess what due to trump making war on Iran and the cost of oil goes up. The ditherprime minister overbrxt.The tech taking over many jobs such in banks, stores and factorys. This country is now in a recession. Unemployment will rise by January 19 to 2 mil

6638 2018-05-03 09:03:49 Well my son as a baby came out in rashes whenever we used traditional soaps or bath washes, but when we used the Aveeno bath oil his skin condition improved dramatically. I guess that was a waste of time and NHS money? I wonder just how thorough this trial was.

6698 2018-05-03 08:48:33 I see garlic.

The bread must be solid and strong, not soft. There are few things more good than this.

6706 2018-05-03 08:46:13 We need the US more than they need us even if we have oil. We can tap into their great intellectual, economic, military and diplomatic resources. It all depends on how well we play our cards. They will not give without collecting, but it is possible to make them do so.

6711 2018-05-03 08:45:06 Oil is rarely discovered anywhere unlike for Poultry farming. We should import few to lower the prices for us consumers. If we are only to have our products, the producer can increase their prices & we won’t have no other options.

6749 2018-05-03 08:36:17 Please stick to the facts. The Golan oil discovery was made AFTER the conflict on Syria had begun.

6826 2018-05-03 08:18:33 Exactly. The money I mentioned certainly contributes to oil deals, but there is a new, fresh, small and cosy aspect to China's use of soft power. They didn't colonize Africa or wage drug wars, bomb Iraq or fund the contras, etc. Mao was a long time ago.

6834 2018-05-03 08:17:24 It has been a total disaster primarily based on oil price as has been seen across the sector.  I think you have to look forward though and at these prices the downside looks minimal (given the destruction of shareholder equity) and Fortuna will make a huge difference.

6850 2018-05-03 08:12:53 ME countries like Saudi Arabia which have great amount of Oil & Gas use Desalination to convert Ocean Water to fresh water.

6852 2018-05-03 08:12:26 @LukeGromen - higher oil usually, contemporaneously - indicates improving EM growth. So, the two graphs should move together, apart from extremes of (high) oil prices, which then becomes a binding constraint. Oil not killing anyone at $75 (brent). At $100 it's another story

6989 2018-05-03 07:42:46 Venezuela economy crashed because of a dip in oil prices since 2014. Most of its revenues come from oil export. As the prices fell its revenues decreased proportionately and the country faced huge fiscal deficit thus collapsing the economy and hence the political system.

7012 2018-05-03 07:34:46 It's a metaphor. I am sure that goes way above your head. Everyone knows the defence AW inherited was a huge part of his initial success.  The proof is he has not replicated that success since the influence of GG went away. He had a supercar. All it needed was an oil change.
7013 2018-05-03 07:34:43 This is funny. My protag in my WIP was just discussing beard oil with a dude with a handlebar mo. And then I read this. Life is weird. PS. If my husband wore choc flavour beard oil, I'd lick his face to death.

7095 2018-05-03 07:18:32 Perhaps. Yet cannabis oil is still illegal in most places so whether it actually works or not is not really relevant as it is unavailable to most people. It's also still illegal to study it in most places so we have no clinical evidence one way or the other.

7150 2018-05-03 07:08:50 That's true. Food alienates people even due to extreme regional variations. Simple things like adding gur to food (as done in some states) creates sharp differences. Or, the cooking oil used. Eastern states use mustard oil to the consternation of a few.

7218 2018-05-03 06:55:49 This type of analysis is short sighted and like an 8th order trade - the economy lived fine with 100 dollar oil - with inflation so low even if it is on the rise, this is not a concern today - in 18-24 months maybe. But considering the capex gap you will NEED to kill some demand.
7219 2018-05-03 06:55:47 And the demand for OIL is rising. Million barrels a day more in 2018 than 2017. China will add 21,000,000 new, oil powered cars THIS YEAR. Not replacement cars, new.
7220 2018-05-03 06:55:43 I rub some fresh tomatoes, olive oil and salt, garlic and serrano ham slices. But only in tomatoes season. The rest of the year sometimes butter and jam, sometimes scrambled eggs with cheese.

7266 2018-05-03 06:47:14 The existence of that pipeline doesn’t change how much oil people use. It was the cost of getting Alberta on-board wth the Federal carbon pricing. Without that, Saskatchewan and Manitoba would not have agreed either. Then the Maritimes would want out, too.

It helps me, the girl with the autoimmune disease, stay healthy! I usually buy from Amazon, but I’m tempted to join their membership on the web.

7383 2018-05-03 06:25:54 Remember always, that the Big3 (BP, Mobil, Z) own 43% of Marsden Refinery & have 4 of 7 board members. 2017 yr, T/O up 16% but profit up 60%! These companies run a virtual monopoly by being the entire supply chain from oil well to petrol pump. They are corporate robber barons.

7387 2018-05-03 06:24:53 No, simply lower oil price. Developing RES, improving energy efficiency and keeping German nuclear in operation would be far more effective than sanctions.

7400 2018-05-03 06:23:35 Yes. Usually I demand a certain percentage depending on the scope of work. Can't pay, I can't start working. It's that simple. No need for me to burn the midnight oil for no pay. Like a client who went under with a business plan which had taken me 2 weeks to put together.

7451 2018-05-03 06:14:15 By us cutting off their oil it prevented millions more Chinese lives to be spared. Also by Germany being a landlocked country with no oil, they had to invade Africa to find it. My point being is that oil/natg isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Wars will keep it relevant always.

7459 2018-05-03 06:12:10 People are political. Oil is decomposed plants. The Saudis flooded the market b/c they have the easiest oil to drill. They killed the market b/c they know we can drill it for the same price and they wanted to kill our rigs. It’s all the same w/Middle East. Oil rules them all.

7521 2018-05-03 06:02:10 Even with operational efficiency and excellent promoters, airlines business will always be affacted by fuel prices uncertainty. For every planeful of passengers, they make profit for last 0-10 passengers. 10 if fuel prices are in check and 0 (or negetive) if oil goes up.
7522 2018-05-03 06:02:04 What you are seeing is refiners buying cheap oil which is giving them good margins but the refineries cannot maximise margins because they cannot change the slate of products they make due to the crude blend they are running.

7529 2018-05-03 06:00:11 Sadly enough, it's the youths grit & confidence in themselves that gives this country the stability she deserves. The govt is busy sharing oil, and fighting for power.
7530 2018-05-03 06:00:10 9. How about the article "Indonesia braces for rising oil prices." What about it? Well, I answered: "Where are those words that indicate the government's intention to raise the oil prices here, by the way?"

7535 2018-05-03 05:59:43 Interestingly I read in a book by an energy industry specialist that when investments tip toward green non-nuclear options collectively most of them would cover both fossil fuels and nuclear being stopped altogether. (The Empty Tank by Jeremy Leggett, former oil geologist)

7542 2018-05-03 05:57:31 No he's not. He's bogged down in the Middle East and we're driving down the price of his oil, which is the only thing propping up his shitty economy. Putin's only other real export is propaganda, which people like you have fallen for hook, line, and sinker.

7554 2018-05-03 05:54:30 Outside Lagos, Abuja and a couple of other states.. not that much activity. And we’re too dependent on oil revenue.. which is their main problem
7555 2018-05-03 05:54:17 They will be MORE able to afford it as technology advances. Renewable will always make more sense. Oil is already replaced in a lot of ways in many places and at an accelerating rate. Pollution may turn you on, but the masses want to breathe. You can't stop change.

7557 2018-05-03 05:53:55 But it would be possible to redistribute any commodity—pork bellies or oil or whatever—because a commodity is fungible. Redistributing sex isn't even hypothetically possible, because sex isn't a commodity.

7564 2018-05-03 05:53:14 I use a divine Berry sugar lip scrub. You just want to eat it. It smells so good. Once you wash the little beads of a oil stays behind. Your lips feel so soft after that

7566 2018-05-03 05:52:56 Long story short, I wore it on occasions that I shouldn't have, there are black paint stains and grilling oil marks on there and they won't come out. Plus it's smaller on me...
7567 2018-05-03 05:52:49 I typically make 20mg -50mg cbd oil capsules & have heard great feedback from this range but 2.5-5 seemed low. I’m going to make a batch at 5 mg for a new patient to try.  I tried some at 10mg but the feedback was that they didn’t notice any difference.

7569 2018-05-03 05:52:15 Tapi just a few drops will do. Either in your frying oil or as a prep. Let me know what you think! :)
7570 2018-05-03 05:52:14 I thought that was olive oil 
7571 2018-05-03 05:51:47 Right which is all fine and dandy considering nothing happens to spark another war. Which these countries based on oil like Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc. are guaranteed to start. Not to mention natural gas and Europe’s reliance on it coming from Russia.
7572 2018-05-03 05:51:42 This seems better than Zinke & Alexander's plan to sell oil and gas leases on public lands and along our coasts. But it just seems hypocritical with all that we know about about climate change and burning fossil fuels to associate gas and oil with repairing our National Parks.

7577 2018-05-03 05:50:23 That no one has agreed upon. You do realize third world countries aren’t going to be able to afford many of these options unless it’s forced upon them. You honestly think that within our lifetime that oil will be replaced? I think not friend. Can’t stop the cartel.

7599 2018-05-03 05:47:08 I use really light coverage bb/cc creams or most times only concealer and set it with loose powder to avoid cakey  but for oiliness around my t zone, I use witch hazel toner and oil free moisturizer. Oiliness can be your skin compensating for dry skin after exfoliation.
7600 2018-05-03 05:46:59 A repressed memory just surfaced: 
My 1st grade teacher once told me they make nail polish from oil extracted from whales, and that if I liked painting my nails I was really killing off whales
7601 2018-05-03 05:46:56 Tighter and more volatile global financial conditions could increase borrowing costs further for oil import countries, adding to existing fiscal sustainability concerns, weighing on bank balance sheets, and undermining private sector activity.

7611 2018-05-03 05:44:44 No kidding. If the price a barrel of oil dropped near $30/Bbl, Russia would be in the financial hurt locker, and Trump isn’t going to let that happen to his buddy Vladdy Put.

7619 2018-05-03 05:42:52 @cnn @msnbc Russia and Putin are among the biggest beneficiaries of high oil prices. Is Trump’s rhetoric on Iran a deliberate ploy to hike oil prices and help Putin? Many of the oil industry connected politicians may also jump to Trump’s corner soon.

7635 2018-05-03 05:39:44 My dad just got home and gave me lavender oil to put on my wrist at night to help me sleep and he also gave me a pair of slippers and it’s little things like that that make me so appreciative of him
7636 2018-05-03 05:39:29 I agree that all companies, oil and gas included, should be taxed fairly.  Hence we agree.
7637 2018-05-03 05:39:25 This article proves the argument that this pipeline should be built, as the third world countries mentioned where this exploitation is occurring should be shut down and replaced with oil from Canada. Here we have worker rights and environmental controls, and transparency
7638 2018-05-03 05:39:22 Republicans are morons. We already know this.  Vets could be helped tremendously with medical marijuana, even cbd oil, when it comes to pain as well as ptsd.

7646 2018-05-03 05:38:17 That was his choice. Doesn't obligate anyone else to do the same. He was weak for letting the actions of another effect HIS conscience.
7647 2018-05-03 05:38:15 Ran into #Oilers #Chiarelli there just today.
7648 2018-05-03 05:38:04 "Oil is not political." LOL
7649 2018-05-03 05:37:56 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
7650 2018-05-03 05:37:44 so today Im using a nice face wash, moisturizing up with coconut oil just lovin on my skin a lil extra. A while later I go get a pizza and im eating it and my face starts to burn and I GOT FUCKING HOT SAUCE IN MY POURS AND ITS STINGINGGGGG
7651 2018-05-03 05:37:39 Go to Basrah and see for yourself the toxoc squalor they live in whilst its one of the highest oil producing areas on Earth, then you'll maybe understand corruption
7652 2018-05-03 05:37:33 How could the UPC do that? The price of oil don’t need to go up. Every other oil rich country/state is booming, because of current provincial and federal governments, taxes and red tape.
7653 2018-05-03 05:37:28 Despite of union petroleum ministry's push 4 private petroleum companies to participate in hydrocarbon search in 28lakh hectares area through OPEN ANCHOR LICENSING POLICY(OALP) only Vedanta corp ltd & public sector ONGC forwarded tenders for 55 oil & gas block wid 110 application
7654 2018-05-03 05:37:28 He needs to do 3 things: First and foremost, don't panic and make another dumb trade. Second, don't by any attention to the big fish on the UFA market. Third, find two or three value deals on the open market, most likely veterans but age doesn't matter.
7655 2018-05-03 05:37:22 I've got the cheapest one from Argos; about  £30. Does the job, has a timer.
The most important thing is the order you put the ingredients in, I've found - water, oil and salt first then flour yeast sugar etc; especially if leaving overnight. Yeast and salt don't get on.
7656 2018-05-03 05:37:19 Update: it wasn’t deodorant. It was the sea salt vanilla scented oil that you put sticks in to make room smell good.
7657 2018-05-03 05:37:02 Hansch and Novakovski are two smart guys, saw them at the rink all season. The Oil Kings are in good hands
7658 2018-05-03 05:37:00 There's actually no such thing as oil from a vegetable. They're industrial seed oils that were first developed as lubricants for industrial machinery. That's the stuff we're overloading our bodies w/on a daily basis.
7659 2018-05-03 05:36:54 It’s because Jesus is the sun, we are the Sun of man or the light through the krystos oil that is secreted from CLAUStrus in the cerebrum and travels down the 33 vertebrate of the spine. Which is why Santa CLAUS brings gifts from the North Pole and comes down the chimney.
7660 2018-05-03 05:36:45 Yes sir...and I have an oil field for sale....
7661 2018-05-03 05:36:39 It's like Colorado but shittier and with less of a fixation on truffle oil.
7662 2018-05-03 05:36:34 ...The same currency they will buy our oil at........could be Scots £.........
7663 2018-05-03 05:36:26 Why are some Oil  Marketing Companies not accepting  LPG cylinders from other brands? Is this a back door way of  going back to locking customers to their product and prices?  @energy_ke @ConsumersKenya

7665 2018-05-03 05:36:25 That's right all wars are commercial deals 
And they found middle east a good place , rich with oil and nobody cares about its people

7667 2018-05-03 05:35:51 By definition: A fossil is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, hair, petrified wood, oil, coal, and DNA remnants.

7671 2018-05-03 05:35:27 Don't breathe easy yet.   Likely no coincidrnce that Kremlin military ships & subs activity has increased globally last few months, including east coast of USA & in Arctic.  Russia, China, & USA waiting for ice melt so they can  claim the oil.

Dear ZeeBusiness Team;
I purchased 50000 Nagarjuna oil @ 3.92 for long term.
Pls advise what to do with it. Regards
7675 2018-05-03 05:34:47 The same could be said of First Nations not living on the coast and not having any skin in the game with the risk of oil tankers spills, and supporting it publicly against those that do.
7676 2018-05-03 05:34:45 Lol
7677 2018-05-03 05:34:38 skincare routine: *violently lathering on layer upon layer of coconut oil & exfoliates in the hopes it reverses the countless nights i spend destroying my skin by falling asleep in my makeup*
7678 2018-05-03 05:34:22 The Conservatives screwed us out of our Heritage Trust Fund a long time ago, not much left to play with, and gave away the majority of the profits of the oil that was to come back to the taxpayers (us) to the oil companies to keep them here. The rest of the money was pissed away.
7679 2018-05-03 05:34:01 sunday riley ufo oil is... insane in the best way
7680 2018-05-03 05:34:01 Apply Baby oil 
7681 2018-05-03 05:33:55 know all the things Obama did for the environment Trump is destroying. The rules for cleaner cars will be gone, rules for big oil gone. Trump said Climate Change isn't so bad first other countries will be flown by water, correct my country will be gone by half if sea level rises
7682 2018-05-03 05:33:41 I wish I didn’t kill my oil lmao
7683 2018-05-03 05:33:37 Just watched a 70 year old man sing mommas broken heart by Miranda Lambert while cleaning an oil spill. Most magical moment of 2018.
7684 2018-05-03 05:33:25 DEFINITELY!!! Flooding, Folks may Not know about if they never have lived it, mudslides, paddle boarding down your local hometowns main drag!!! Plus too much oil/exhaust on roadsmake super slick. That’s All I Have to Say About that
7685 2018-05-03 05:33:20 Yes, that's for sure. Although, there was a ton of shattered glass everywhere. I transfer my olive oil into a designer decanter which is now no more.
7686 2018-05-03 05:33:17 Kuwait oil price up 3 cents to USD 68.80 pb
7687 2018-05-03 05:33:04 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
7688 2018-05-03 05:33:01 Yeah. That too. I assumed he had fixed the oil issue. He said it's running but no power. Could be the capacitor in that case if all other issues had been rectified

7696 2018-05-03 05:31:17 I read online that tea tree oil helps hypertrophic scarring so I put some on read a little further and it said DO NOT PUT UNDILUTED TEA TREE OIL ON A PIERCING that it’s too harsh and causes irritation and burns so I flung myself out of bed to wash it off why am I so stupid
7697 2018-05-03 05:31:04 The world has a consortium of Oil rich nations today. They practically control not only the prices of oil directly but also prices of everything and politics across the world indirectly, due to their vice like grip on oil.  But as we all know, oil is a depleting resource. #SunDay

7703 2018-05-03 05:29:53 I thought I was allergic too! I’ve had my acrylics on and off for 2 years! I talked to my nail artist and we tried switching to products for sensitive skin but it ended up I was allergic to the cuticle oil she put on after my nails!
7704 2018-05-03 05:29:27 3 - why would you include trump/lobbyists as oil is not political and hasn’t been replaced for a century. Show me the science proving fossil fuels are on their way out...I would be very interested in seeing you prove this.
7705 2018-05-03 05:29:20 Such fools, the envronmentalists are paid by other oil comp to tell  natives that it will destroy our fish so their oil sells. What fish,only a smell remains.
7706 2018-05-03 05:28:54 Why are you spreading lies? Prove it! Fake news @Wilkinson4BC
 The stance on the pipeline has no effect on the price of our gas. The lack of rafineries & that in BC we buy our oil from the US. Because the BC liberals never planned for it. That's why!

Stop lying.
7707 2018-05-03 05:28:46 WHY DOES MAINSTREAM MEDIA LIE TO US also idk anything about skin care tbh i just know ppl think coconut oil is like jesus spunk or something
7708 2018-05-03 05:28:40 noooo I love truffle oil
7709 2018-05-03 05:28:34 I think the argument was for gun ownership, not so much criminal intent.. 

Also anyone bringing a gun to a preschool with the intention of killing kids would probably be stopped quicker if the teachers also had guns to protect the students.

So it COULD be a good idea.
7710 2018-05-03 05:28:18 Today I changed the oil and filters in my car for the first time. Feeling quite capable now.
7711 2018-05-03 05:28:04 Seriously? I never tried cooking with sesame oil
7712 2018-05-03 05:28:01 By the way, I am a college graduate who owns a ranch, and has done everything from break horses to negotiate contracts with oil and methane companies. A lawyer studied one of my contracts, and said it was the best he had ever seen-counting his.
7713 2018-05-03 05:27:55 House cleaned. Sunless tanner on . Clothes in the dryer. Essential oil defuser on. Editing pictures . I feel so successful right now.
7714 2018-05-03 05:27:50 China is mapping for oil & methane deposits in South China Sea n probably need land in strategic locations for their future convenience. Failure for timely repayments on the ECRL loan of 55 Billion $$ may provide the strategic location for the port operations they want #GE14

7723 2018-05-03 05:26:51 Sounds like you're demeaning the profession of a porn star. Have you ever bought baby oil? Have you ever watched porn on your little computer? 99% chance you have WATCHED PORN, while using baby oil. So why demean her profession if you have MOST LIKELY supported it? HYPOCRITE!!!!!
7724 2018-05-03 05:26:31 You know... constant meetings, permanent consultants leeching resources, silos and a mix-up that shows only one country is part of the #EU and the other is only part of #NATO! The lack of oil money forces sweden to be efficient!

7728 2018-05-03 05:25:40 if you’re a makeup brand and you put anything coconut related in your products (coconut oil, water, etc.) can you start putting it on your packaging i am literally so tired of breaking out because it doesn’t say it’s in it 
7729 2018-05-03 05:25:40 Yes these men don't look like fulanis, what am thinking now is if FG can order all herdsmen to register & have a permits or ID card.
7730 2018-05-03 05:25:25 Seriously peppermint oil works!! I use it every year. Haven’t had a spider problem in YEARS!!!! We always had huge spiders because of the woods behind the house.
7731 2018-05-03 05:25:22 But I don't agree that it would be nearly that low, because I think the difference between the average HS pitcher and the average low-A pitcher is FAR greater than the difference between Oil Can Boyd and Jeremy Hellickson

7743 2018-05-03 05:21:42 Very rarely does an elephant ever die of natural causes. In the wild they have no water or food or place to go bc the forests have been destroyed by the palm oil industry. Or they are poached or captured and forced into captivity
7744 2018-05-03 05:21:22 castor oil! i used it to grow back my brows. works wonders.
7745 2018-05-03 05:21:19 Dear Madam, currently the oil prices are on rise. This 2018 not 2014. Good Morning
7746 2018-05-03 05:21:19 Not the capacitor ma'am.
The oil seal between the oil compartment and coil is most probably damaged. 
This would stop the coil from working optimally, and ultimately burn out.

7751 2018-05-03 05:20:34 Yeah, but they would have interior lines, the food, the oil. Also the possibility of harassing our supplies. Best case scenario is a Vietnam type  quagmire in our own country. Education and outreach is still the best strategy.

I suggest peppermint oil though. Just a tiny bit on your temples and back of your neck. Of course all of those things will help but just throwing that out there 
7755 2018-05-03 05:20:00 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?

7757 2018-05-03 05:19:28 I don't bet. I invest. And I have already invested in renewables. Btw I have also set up two oil companies - one now listed. It's not either/or is is a journey of transformation over decades. During transformation there will be hiccups - deal with it.

7772 2018-05-03 05:17:31 Global Market, heavy bitumen is the worst to refine, we don’t want to pollute Canada anymore than we have to, Americans are selling our oil back to us as fuel and making double... WE ARE FOOLS, They are getting richer than ever because we can’t export.

7781 2018-05-03 05:16:26 Tea tree oil saved my life
7782 2018-05-03 05:16:24 Cooking up some potatoes for lunch and spattered hot oil all over my arms. Nothing bad, but very stupid.
7783 2018-05-03 05:16:17 We have environmental surcharges (taxes) on oil, oil filters, tires, electronics and so on and the $ just goes to Gen revenue benefiting no one except political parties.  Wake up Canada, the environment is just a convenient excuse to raise ur taxes.
7784 2018-05-03 05:15:53 Descending triangles tend to break out to the downside in my experience. Going with the odds. I am equity net short but have various longs to hedge/protect. BTW, your oil shorts and dollar long would likely rip in a S&P 500 breakdown.

7788 2018-05-03 05:15:38 The only way to prevent oil spills is to LEAVE IT IN THE FUCKING GROUND.

7792 2018-05-03 05:14:49 Trumps dream of a fossilize world is diminishing everyday! Trump & the Republicans are dinosaurs & so is the gas & oil business! I hope Trump deep six all his money in these dead industries while the rest of us invest in a cleaner greener energy future!
7793 2018-05-03 05:14:44 Honestly as long as it's coconut oil it helps. I have "Pure coconut oil" from the Fred Meyer brand and it works decently too. The organic stuff is definitely better but either works.

7796 2018-05-03 05:13:39 That's not what we should be grading it on but to be fair, two of their current top 4 d at the NHL level were drafted by the previous regime. As far as goalies go, Dubnyk is the only good goalie they've drafted since Fuhr in '81.

Second fleet is a little more tricky since Nelson's Big Seven skill is maxed and procs often enough to cut into the front line's gains. That extra 12 oil adds up too
7860 2018-05-03 05:02:39 Perhaps that has a lot to do with his success at draft table and his overwhelmingly dismal trade record.
7861 2018-05-03 05:02:34 One day, maybe in my time, the question will be asked: 'what is the land to be used for, food or energy'

7888 2018-05-03 04:59:01 If one equates “better for the oil and gas industry” and “worse for the environment” with “better for Colorado”, then the Governor’s statement makes sense.

7901 2018-05-03 04:57:26 Funny thing is, outside of Hutton,  none of those guys get $2.5M on the UFA market.
7902 2018-05-03 04:57:08 Oil jobs are at risk because it is 2018 and transportation is being converted to electricity globally.

7922 2018-05-03 04:54:10 Sure. But this an Indian Oil outlet.
7923 2018-05-03 04:54:03 Possibly but it's still far to early to say. Again, unless they are overruling their scouts, I don't put the actual picks on the GM.
7924 2018-05-03 04:53:51 Sir @RahulGandhi There are many important issues to be raised of in the country. Why don't you try to make a strong opposition by raising those issues? Dont you see Oil price hike, unemployment, Old Pension matter, Cash crisis? We expect a change from congress.
7925 2018-05-03 04:53:39 I don't like truffle oil either, Valerie.

7931 2018-05-03 04:52:34 Trust me, same. You have to trick it until it knows not to produce so much oil. Start by washing every other or every two days but still conditioning on those off days and using dry shampoo

7942 2018-05-03 04:50:16 I did and disagree with their assessment.
7943 2018-05-03 04:50:10 Of all the oil producing countries, we have the lowest production per capita, hence the poorest noticing that over 80 percent of govt revenue is from crude oil sales.

7956 2018-05-03 04:48:22 In all honesty, the one thing that GM's get credit or venom for, and generally deserve little of either, is drafting. Unless your GM is a baffon, the scouting staff ultimately decides who an organization drafts.

7962 2018-05-03 04:46:56 6. Sleeping with make up on.

Makeup clogs pores and oil glands and can cause eye irritation. Furthermore, it traps free radicals throughout the day which can then wear down collagen. It's important to wash at the end of the day to clear oil buildup.

7973 2018-05-03 04:44:37 Liberalism dared to challenge consumerism. They looked at the books and realized "we can't keep buying so much oil, it's destroying life on earth". They looked at the crime reports and said "we can't allow guns to fall into so many hands"....

7976 2018-05-03 04:44:11 I still remember the day in 80s when India celeberated  the ONGC khoj of crude oil in Bombay High. Then analysts wrote in next 10-20 years our import will reduce to 50% from 97%. Alas that khoj was only fr few drops. Till today we r importing 90% of our requirement.

8061 2018-05-03 04:31:35 Have you ever tried cbd oil? it's a healthy alternative to doctor meds. Something worth looking into for anxiety/depression. Just a thought.

8071 2018-05-03 04:29:58 Its less about oil and more about the currency used to buy and sell that oil..the dollar..aka petro dollar.  Without petro dollar, US currency would have less value then paper its printed on.  Iran (& china & russia) pose threat to dollar by wanting to trade oil in other currency
8072 2018-05-03 04:29:37 That's oil money for you.
8073 2018-05-03 04:29:20 @adoradio0 are you going to dab the oil?
8074 2018-05-03 04:29:15 @CNN Bullsh*t news: $3/gal gas coming cuz of Trump and possible Iran sanctions. (actually domestic oil production has never, ever been higher. Trump alluded recently to ships being filled with oil and kept out of the market). Frackers in the US will continue to ramp up production
8075 2018-05-03 04:29:08 I used to put oil like this into capsules and just pop em.
8076 2018-05-03 04:29:07 Yeah, my point being: That’s a fair comparable for Koskinen. Did he out-perform most G’s at that price point? We’ll see. 
8077 2018-05-03 04:28:48 For Nanar oil refinery project at Ratnagiri, Maharashtra BJP govt to acquire 14,000 acres by destroying 6 cr mango & cashewnut trees. Farmers protesting!!.  Why fertile land being used 4 refinery proj @AUThackeray  Shiv Sena should stop Land grabbing & destruction of Maharashtra?
8078 2018-05-03 04:28:36 I agree bro. Less annoying oil
8079 2018-05-03 04:28:29 i put tea tree oil on my acne which is on my cheek! right under my eye! and now im crYING
8080 2018-05-03 04:28:18 Use your voice. You can voice concern about deforestation for PALM OIL development and help to pressure companies, manufacturers and governments to take Serious action. #cutconflictpalmoil
8081 2018-05-03 04:28:17 I started using cbd oil as a healthy alternative to doctor meds. I use @NaturesUltra Check them out and let me know what you think. anxiety aint nothing to play with. Best of luck
8082 2018-05-03 04:27:52 I'm sure it was the magic combination of wild nuclear threats and gutting the State Dept after putting a former oil CEO in charge of it?
8083 2018-05-03 04:27:45 Your view is that equivalent goalies were available for less. It isn’t mine. We’ll get to see who’s right.
8084 2018-05-03 04:27:39 Engine oil is for the weak. Use battery acid.
8085 2018-05-03 04:27:36 Putting coconut oil on ya toast instead of butter really not that bad, trying to eat healthy is fuckin fun

8087 2018-05-03 04:27:22 He drank oil thinking it was coffee
8088 2018-05-03 04:27:03 So you think the UCP is going to somehow make the price of oil go up?
8089 2018-05-03 04:26:45 They could be. However...Clean rubber is our choice. We have rubber contacts who are pleased to hear of our new industry. We will support farmers and suppliers. Crude oil? not so much. Make tarmac.
8090 2018-05-03 04:26:33 1 so far haha.
8091 2018-05-03 04:26:14 But they have so much oil!!!!!
8092 2018-05-03 04:26:10 So after driving 3500kms (2175miles) across the desert my engine definitely sounds different. Should I be worried? It doesn't sound like it's about to explode or anything, and the oil level is fine so it's not grinding itself up.. I think I'll just continue and hope for the best.
8093 2018-05-03 04:26:07 I didn’t say there were none. I said how many?
8094 2018-05-03 04:25:56 I just got Active B Complete (30ct), Emulsified MCT Oil - Creamy Vanilla (16oz), Onnit Joint Oil - Tangerine
8095 2018-05-03 04:25:47 None. But gambling that much cap space on anything less is nonsensical as equivalent goalies were/are available for far cheaper.
8096 2018-05-03 04:25:35 あと親父に知らないかとLINE送ったら既読無視されてるのもめちゃくちゃ謎
8097 2018-05-03 04:25:35 I hear all of your Trump Clothing & goods are made in China. Thanks to Scot Pruitt & his gas & oil friends gas prices will be going through the roof. Lies about releasing your taxes. Lies about your Health. And thanks to Rudy Guiliani, lies about paying porn star Stormy Daniels.
8098 2018-05-03 04:25:34 check out @NaturesUltra They provide cbd oil products which help manage anxiety which can help you sleep better. I started using it for my amxiety/sleeping and it's slowing but surely helping. check it out and let me know your thoughts.
8099 2018-05-03 04:25:19 Just don’t use oil or you will be a crispy lobster

Over 10 lakh trees & 1000 of acres of Agricultural land will be wiped out, WHY all projects Hv to be on agricultural land and not on Barren land.
8104 2018-05-03 04:24:06 I think he even makes less.
8105 2018-05-03 04:24:02 I miss smelling the scent of virgin coconut oil on my hair. I wish I could give myself a treatment this Friday. I miss it.

8109 2018-05-03 04:22:42 idk what's the use of the sunflower beauty oil i bought from eb, is this for face or for boddddy?
8110 2018-05-03 04:22:36 Yes he has..and is DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY IN THE PROCESS..POLUTE THE AIR, DESTROY OUR CLEAN WATER..DRILL FOR OIL ON OUR COASTS OR ON OUR FEDERAL LANDS..GREAT JOB! WE AMERICANS WILL VOTE OUT THE GOP IN 2018.
8111 2018-05-03 04:22:31 @realDonaldTrump The Oil companies are sticking to the poor and middle class again. You give them a wind fall increase in profits with the tax cuts then they raise the price of gas simply because it's summer. That's a Shitty Deal. It's like price gouging after a hurricane.
8112 2018-05-03 04:22:24 Iya kalo dijual disini segitu kalo ke LN namanya jadi Scorpion Oil harganya 10 jt USD hehe #aidontingabauddet
8113 2018-05-03 04:22:09 Just shows that US "wars on terror" are really about defending the petrodollar.

Saddam and Ghadafi threatened the dollar and got overthrown. Saudi sells oil in dollars and is allowed to sponsor terrorism.

8115 2018-05-03 04:21:52 Not surprised at all that you love your $100k+ luxury car. Not saying they can’t make a few nice cars... just no chance they can mass produce affordable cars...and $TSLA equity is worthless. One little nit, EV are not oil free, lots of hydrocarbons involved in electric production
8116 2018-05-03 04:21:47 It’s the greatest EVERYTHING! I have 4c hair and it’s never been manageable in its natural state until I put coconut oil in it! And coconut oil can be used as mouth wash and your teeth feel great after!
8117 2018-05-03 04:21:45 Where the fuck did he get coconut oil ?
8118 2018-05-03 04:21:39 sandy no that's oil
8119 2018-05-03 04:21:36 Dude.  You are seriously in Manitoba. I'm happy about your indoor plumbing, and the switch away for whale oil for lighting, but baby steps with the internet. You make yourself look dumb

8123 2018-05-03 04:20:50 I doubt it very much he will. Hes already got his bribe. Hes not crossing his bribe   givers He will never give that money up. You look at bribes he took from oil, tells you allot about him so you know whats he doing with this deal.

8129 2018-05-03 04:19:16 Only wash at night and use an oil cleanser like Tatcha to cleanse. Then follow with moisturizer.

8135 2018-05-03 04:18:19 *kids. Damn brain-corroding olive oil.
8136 2018-05-03 04:18:05 Oil barrel drums, it the only thing recent enough to not be appropriatable.

8139 2018-05-03 04:17:46 only bleach it when it's dirty (the oil protects your hair & scalp), use conditioner heavily afterwards, try to avoid bleaching hair more than once. twice is ok if you're VERY careful but any more and it may start breaking so after the 1st time just bleach the roots if you can.
8140 2018-05-03 04:17:25 I always enjoyed his commentary when watching oil change. The refs would break up a scrum and he’s like  “oh I was just congratulating him on his new contract”

8143 2018-05-03 04:17:10 King Jaja of Opobo (1821–1891) founded Opobo city (now in Nigeria) in 1867 and shipped palm oil to Britain independently.

8148 2018-05-03 04:16:14 Knocking it out of the park in my eyes would be outperforming Talbot with a .926 save percentage while playing at least 30+ games and potentially stealing the #1 job.
8149 2018-05-03 04:16:13 for the most part, yes..but oil + gas fracking may quickly supplant agriculture
8150 2018-05-03 04:16:07 All energies of the federal government, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
8151 2018-05-03 04:16:00 Yah think???    The fact Trump no longer condemns this type of behavior by his appointees as he did with Price likely means that the payoff from big oil and polluters is enormous for him.
8152 2018-05-03 04:15:59 So y’all remember I got an oil diffuser a few days ago? I still ain’t smell nothing I’m convinced it was another waste of money.
8153 2018-05-03 04:15:30 Also , the government literally isn’t completely controlled by him. But you’re right, he single handily is destroying our environment...he’s out there every morning pouring oil in our oceans... happy?

8158 2018-05-03 04:14:39 Ah. The one who got eaten by a pack of zombies. Or was he stabbed by a really long sword? It's all a blur. I think the olive oil is infecting my brain.

8165 2018-05-03 04:12:17 Looking at the different replies defines that every step of this is false equivalence. Even if I wanted it to win.

8168 2018-05-03 04:12:02 So I was thinking ... If the big issue with BC not allowing a pipeline to run  is because Alberta will lose oil sales to foreign purchasers then maybe we should rethink that strategy. Say..why not sell it to Canadians?
8169 2018-05-03 04:11:39 food// hot tip: if you're making caccio e pepe as a late-night snack because you're a broken mess who needs starch and cheese, adding a bit of crushed sichuan peppercorns to the oil really adds a lot of complexity and fun flavors
8170 2018-05-03 04:11:36 You have to completely stop straightening your hair, instead of shampooing do cowashes or use products that do not contain sulfates or parabens. Also olaplex treatments help & oil treatments but you have to learn which oils are good for your hair type

8172 2018-05-03 04:11:28 The guy who changed my oil told me "I've been struggling to place you, and then I realized: you remind me of my favorite stripper."

8173 2018-05-03 04:11:19 Ohhhhh! OK. Sorry. I'm partially-brain dead from Stalingrad Claudia's olive oil treatment. Also, do I want to know what this #PorchdickJunior thing is? Never mind, I don't want to know.
8174 2018-05-03 04:11:16 Wow, #Trump is revealed as a liar!

8183 2018-05-03 04:10:33 Handy-otherkin tip: Before changing your oil, always stand in your driveway with solar-powered megaphone and ostentatiously acknowledge your detached garage is built on un-ceded traditional First Nations land. Then just take it to Jiffy Lube, if you have a coupon.

8200 2018-05-03 04:07:46 I seem to forget all about the bugs, the sweat, the lack of non-black clothing I own, and the increased oil production of my face when I’m tweeting in the winter about wanting warm weather

8205 2018-05-03 04:06:43 kung pwede ko lang ibenta yung oil sa mulkha ko de sana meron akong perang pang pa derma

the joke is that i actually say i need a dermatologist
8206 2018-05-03 04:06:15 The world's worst human rights violators and the West's bestest buddies. Nothing to do with oil is it?
8207 2018-05-03 04:05:50 He said he would come back if I paid for his gas here and back plus an oil change for his car... I’m good, he can stay over there lmfao

8209 2018-05-03 04:05:30 Used that baby oil
8210 2018-05-03 04:05:22 I need a oil change 
8211 2018-05-03 04:05:12 I didn't know this waxy oil  "ambergris" could be so valuable.

8214 2018-05-03 04:04:13 I believe Putin wants to run a line for oil to S. Korea that needs to go through N. Korea. Two birds with one stone...He can boost Trumps popularity, as well.

8218 2018-05-03 04:03:38 @Consumers_India Which Groundnut Oil is better for Health? Refined or Filtered? Are these Oils from market tested by fssai @fssaiindia or any Food /Health @MoHFW_INDIA ministry for purity?Are there trace of Chemicals in ediable Oils? @Ministry of Food @jagograhakjago @consaff
8219 2018-05-03 04:03:38 Serious question... does anyone have experience with CBD lotion (not oil) and if so what is the dosage for my leg and back?
8220 2018-05-03 04:03:33 Lev.24: The oil that fuelled the light came from pressed olives. The Lord can produce a light of life and hope out of our times of pressing and pain! #lovetheBible #vayikra
8221 2018-05-03 04:03:25 Are you going to end any relationship you may have with the palm oil supplier who is destroying West Papuan rainforests?
8222 2018-05-03 04:03:21 I can tell you where all our money went. Republicans keep giving it away to rich people. Bet you cant even count high enough for the govt handouts to corporations. Just the oil industry alone gets BILLIONS.
8223 2018-05-03 04:02:46 Wasn't long ago the CAD was in the low .50 range. Early 2000s if I remember correctly. I Imagine if Oil doesn't increase here soon and the CDN drops it will spike inflation. Then all hell will break lose as rates will need to rise quick no matter how much debt is on the table
8224 2018-05-03 04:02:44 @RealMikePompeo In 1959 nobody though that Castro a banana tyrant would be a nuclear threat and should dominate Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia. Today USA, Europe, Israel… close their eyes to the great danger that is Maduro-RedKorea-Iran-narco whith the biggest oil world reserve
8225 2018-05-03 04:02:43 Will look for follow through from yday bear trap recovery - above 6810 we will keep buying. Use ydays open price as a pivot. Taking out 6810 would lead the way for new highs soon. Rbob divergence but that can be consistent with higher prices. #Oil #OPEC

8230 2018-05-03 04:01:40 Very good advice! I like sesame oil because it adds a nice flavor, great in a stir fry! (Any will work though)

8237 2018-05-03 04:00:24 I love roasting mine by cutting them in half with some oil, salt, and drizzled in balsamic vinegar syrup.. or with honey and pepper flakes
8238 2018-05-03 04:00:22 Would check it out but wouldn’t you know, beard oil is not in my wheelhouse. 
8239 2018-05-03 04:00:11 ...a ton of money into their coffers in the form of oil and gas revenue.  So yeah, there you have it. I'm a progressive liberal Democrat who knows exactly who runs the world and exactly how it works and is here to tell you buddy, in this kind of situation the only thing you can..
8240 2018-05-03 04:00:10 He perked up at the idea.
"We could use some eucalyptus oil I have."
The bed sounded nice. He was mentally and physically exhausted and could use to lay down and get out of his nice clothes.

8245 2018-05-03 03:59:08 lavender oil on the temples and massage gently in. I suffer from week long migraines and sometimes this is all that helps . hope it passes soon!
8246 2018-05-03 03:59:08 I actually made the most delicious one today! Spinach and arugula as the base. Brussels sprouts, butternut squash, asparagus, baked carrots, roasted cauliflower, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, avocado, chicken, olive oil, and a little bit of salt.

8253 2018-05-03 03:57:35 You're not a diesel Ferdinand. Your an oil burning steam engine like Timothy at the China Clay Pits.
8254 2018-05-03 03:57:31 totally agree.  Houston has always been an oil city.  People get disgusting salaries.
8255 2018-05-03 03:57:14 Had me until coconut oil, omg it makes my skin break out so bad
8256 2018-05-03 03:56:55 I’ve tried it and even with a capful I end up with the squirts @TrickyFixture   Tummy aches if it’s too concentrated for the “oil”

8263 2018-05-03 03:56:14 And you're losing because your tyrannical regime is goo only at exporting extremism, brutally repressing its people and foolishly deluding itself that the country's oil reserve will not be made unnecessary by technological advancements such as the ones Tesla is spearheading.
8264 2018-05-03 03:56:13 I need to refill my olive oil decanter. Please hand me a funnel?

8266 2018-05-03 03:56:02 What’s the wildest request your mom consistently makes at restaurants? Mine asks for “no oil” in dishes & ALWAYS follows that up with the suggestion that if they need a LITTLE oil for cooking, they can just “spray a little Pam in the bottom of the pan.”
8267 2018-05-03 03:55:29 When I feel like this, all I want to do is write an article or do a podcast. But, a term paper on Venezuelan oil is due at 9 AM so......
8268 2018-05-03 03:55:05 Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga Out of duct tape so when he prayin I ignore the nigga
8269 2018-05-03 03:55:04 use chopsticks more when cooking. They’re especially great to move bacon around easily on the pan and still keep a safe distance from hot oil splatter.
8270 2018-05-03 03:55:04 I started using cbd oil and it's helping me bring my anxiety level down. It typically takes a few weeks to really notice a difference but it's a healthy alternative. i use @NaturesUltra check them out. DM me is you have questions as i can give you info on how it's affecting me

8277 2018-05-03 03:53:45 Yes. I live in Houston so my summer moisturizer is oil free to reduce shine and I wear sunscreen daily. Winter is a thicker moisturizer and I use retinol.
8278 2018-05-03 03:53:43 いや、冷静に考えてなくなるわけないんだよな
8279 2018-05-03 03:53:39 My sister thought the bottle of oil was apple juice & put it in the freezer

8293 2018-05-03 03:51:43 yeah but that wasnt locusts it was those big passover crackers with too fresh feta and whole unpitted  olives packed in oil.
8294 2018-05-03 03:51:30 According to more than a few observers, Gadhafi’s plan to quit selling Libyan oil in U.S. dollars — demanding payment instead in gold-backed “dinars” (a single African currency made from gold) — was the real cause [of the Libyan war and killing of Gadhafi--->

8301 2018-05-03 03:50:25 I think the reason for the consumption level you mentioned is because it's a very ugly dark subject, that I think most can't bear the thought of.  I can't imagine the horrors military men have to go through so greedy elite can get their oil.

8306 2018-05-03 03:49:29 The trick is to cook it with olive oil, so it's easier to scrape into the trash can

8324 2018-05-03 03:47:12 No one has forced you to do anything.  Oil and gas are the cheapest form of energy we have, there are other emergent technologies but they still need developement time.  We will get there, but if people continue to overhype and drive up expectations the reality will never match.

8329 2018-05-03 03:45:39 【add oil】

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

8332 2018-05-03 03:45:25 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

8333 2018-05-03 03:45:22 At the end of the day my Twitter and Insta following would need to be much higher IMO and that’s really never been a goal for me. It’s a lot to think about. Plus, is lilac oil really the key? Is John messing up my kitchen?

8362 2018-05-03 03:41:56 Ever wonder why Russia and Iran are targets, outside the official Neo-Con and NWO Narrative. Iran and Russia are standing in the way of the greater Israel project. Oh, and Iran doesn't have a Rothschild controlled central bank. Plus the oilygarghs want their oil back.

8373 2018-05-03 03:40:40 How much oil is left???
8374 2018-05-03 03:40:36 I think that inquiry is still ongoing. With energy on the rise it will start balancing the budget more positive again. See, this is conservatism. The liberalsare responsible for the price of oil. Because that’s what caused the unbalancing of the economy in the first place.

8408 2018-05-03 03:35:53 I see fault in both parties. Trump is a snake oil salesman. His damage to the republic will take years to fix. He has no concise geopolitical plan. He is a word salad of talking points. Hasn’t done a solo press conference in over a year. Why? He can’t. Too many lies.
8409 2018-05-03 03:35:53 Rejoice in the Lord with me for He's indeed faithful.
He's delivered me from the jaws of savage wolves.
He's sent His Angels to my rescue from death.
I'm restored.
He's sending your Samuel ,your anointing oil is ready.
Just hold a little longer ,He's heard your cry

1. I live in north van, it has a half dozen grain terminals with about 3 ships per day leaving our port for grain alone. Shut that down and the world starves.
2. Oil terminal is right across the water from me and has safely shipped oil for 60 years.

8516 2018-05-03 03:19:56 Absolutely. The spin doctors are burning the midnight oil preparing a response worthy of a not so stable genius, and his entourage of sycophants.

8550 2018-05-03 03:15:24 We could live without facebook, we could live without oil and gas. We need pure water to survive. Can;t grow food or raise animals without clean water. Think about this when the world blows up.
8551 2018-05-03 03:15:21 Fuel prices are a burden to our economy. We take a tiny fraction of the possible royalties from oil, and the uncertainty around fuel prices has citizens scared and businesses unable to plan on expenses.

8557 2018-05-03 03:14:29 I didn’t even notice a bug bite!. 

I’m not much for mascara lately. In addition to the CP and other crap, I have chronic dry eye. The most effective drops contain an omega-3 oil. Not great w/ mascara.  So don’t tell anyone but I dye my lashes and put growth serum on. So vain.

Do you also think there is an infinite supply of oil?

8574 2018-05-03 03:11:29 With the help of a diffuser, aromatherapy is the one practice we can easily include in our lives. When we want to ease angst due to the impact of simply living this life, reach for the lavender essential oil and diffuser and wait for its calming effect. #lavender #diffuser
8575 2018-05-03 03:11:28  I feel you. Facebook mom groups are ridiculous.  broken bones get cured with coconut oil and improper usage of a carseat is defended because 'the car wasn't moving'

8603 2018-05-03 03:09:13 Made the switch from coconut oil to rosehip oil as my moisturizer and my skin has been thanking me ever since

8605 2018-05-03 03:09:08 Ehhh, that oil treatment got it. But girl our hair soak up moisture it’ll be normal in a few days. I would just do nice slick backs!
8606 2018-05-03 03:09:06 It would be difficult to argue though that the oil companies and refineries are not completely aware of the differences in emissions between CAN and the US. And to say that the reason they didn’t clean Canadian refineries up was because they fell within gov’t standards is lame!
8607 2018-05-03 03:09:05 Not too many have that, Nique comes to mind. Solicited a real reaction. Love Utah man, from the top of the organization on down. Built a group of guys that can really play then struck oil with Donovan.
8608 2018-05-03 03:09:00 Yes, or at least get less toxic versions of them ie from a health food store.Sorry to take so long getting back to you. Any oil base face cream will be a problem.
8609 2018-05-03 03:09:00 Sure, you can change oil in 3.2 minutes -- but the oil has to *want* to change.

8622 2018-05-03 03:07:05 The problem the Greens have is that if the vote fown the waka jumping bill then NZF will vote down the ban on oil and gas exploration.
8623 2018-05-03 03:06:47 So you’ll believe a bunch of knobs who are paid by the oil and gas industry instead?  Bravo.  You’re lost. We have all the proof in the world that the oceans are rising due to climate change. I just thought @BillNye would make it easy for you to understand.

8632 2018-05-03 03:04:54 Yeah, sound a little like Sharia law. If you don't like the new "Scouts" you could start your own "boys only" organization.

Explain to me the point of keeping boys and girls apart. My girls can change the oil in their cars and cut the grass and build a fire.

8640 2018-05-03 03:03:55 They thought I would bring it right back in to have it fixed. Well it didn’t go off very often and when it warned me it turned off within seconds. I wasn’t going to fix it, then he bought the part and did it, and did an oil change. He said someone screwed with it, WAY to gunky!

8645 2018-05-03 03:03:08 Pops would say they could not oil their guns because the cold would make them jam. Could not make a fire and slept with bare feet because any sweat in socks would cause frost bite. Rough times!
8646 2018-05-03 03:03:08 MPOB already started to initiate the campaign for sustainable palm oil, which is actually great

8722 2018-05-03 02:51:05 Most people think that oil is just motor fuel.
When you look around your house you realise how much it fills our life, in surfaces, products, clothing, computing, bins, etc.  all of this has come about in my lifetime. 
Reducing it would be possible, but difficult

8734 2018-05-03 02:49:22 Why? The oil companies are loving this. Look for record oil profits and even more jobs in the energy sector. Of course, the jobs will end as soon as the price drops again. This is how crony capitalism works.

2) Salicylic Acid face wash, doesn’t matter which one. As long as it’s oil free and has salicylic acid.
8743 2018-05-03 02:47:48 Yup. Sbb baby takde ubat selsema. So yg ni mcm spray untuk cairkan selsema dia. Sehari boleh spray up to 9 kali. Spray lepastu sedut guna nasal aspirator. Mmg semua baby guna ni. Or boleh buat garlic oil.
8744 2018-05-03 02:47:33 If you have an oil diffuser do you use recipes or just toss stuff in as you feel like?
8745 2018-05-03 02:47:32 the govt gets most of it's tax revenue from citizens and small business as opposed to big companies, while the oil money the govt makes doesn't go to the people or to any meaningful spending.

8755 2018-05-03 02:46:07 China is the second biggest oil importing country in the world currently and its net oil imports (5.86mbd in 2012)....
8756 2018-05-03 02:45:24 Check your Transmission oil today.
8757 2018-05-03 02:45:08 Not coconut. Coconut oil is a saturated fat, which's why it's solid at room temperature. Extra virgin olive oil is fine, but be careful how olive oils are extracted.

Also, olive oil has a low smoke point, so you really can't cook in it. I generally use butter.
8758 2018-05-03 02:45:07 FACTS R PERTINENT; IGNORANT LIES FROM THE RIGHT ON BEHALF OF FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES R SO MUCH FLATULENCE. BUBBA, MUCH OF MY INCOME IS FROM FROM OIL & GAS PRODUCTION. I ALSO INVEST HEAVILY IN ENERGY STOCKS & FUTURES BUT I HAVE CUT OPERATIONS COSTS MASSIVELY USING GREEN TECH.

3. Kills his credibility trying to sell neurotropics and snake skin oil BS

Ppl may enjoy his show. He's free 2 do whatever, but there is plenty of reasons to consider him nuts
8761 2018-05-03 02:44:16 I'll have to check, but sometime in the 1970's Europe started allowing massive numbers of immigrants from Muslim countries in exchange for lower oil prices. One theory is that this was the start of the globalist plan to break down western countries.

8765 2018-05-03 02:43:36 This is exactly it. On a team where cap space limited, finding value contracts is imperative.  I don't know that signing a goalie of unknown NHL ability for 2.5M will yield a player 2.5 times more effective than the Al Montoya's of the world.

8773 2018-05-03 02:42:43 De-seeded and finely diced on a piece of toasted sourdough that's been rubbed with a garlic clove. Salt, pepper, olive oil and a sprinkle of fresh basil.
8774 2018-05-03 02:42:38 Russia went up when oil prices hit all time high, and went down equally faster when price dropped.

Same happening with other commodity driven countries like Brazil, while India clearly appears to belong to the top group.

In PPP terms we are already at no.3 ($10.4 trillion).
8775 2018-05-03 02:42:37 Don’t ask me for no ride cause I’m charging for gas, oil, anti-freeze, battery, and tire usage.

8780 2018-05-03 02:41:37 Ooo no.. A little oil goes a long way. Take it from someone who couldn't take oil and fatty food for 2 weeks. Have u ever eaten steam fish from a Chinese restaurant without the Kuah? Life was so colourless.
8781 2018-05-03 02:41:36 psa: if you put coconut oil in your bath it gives you the smoothest legs, or even rub it in where ever while in the shower & it helps reduce the appearance of stretch marks!! your welcome :)

Anything you can do to increase the moisture in your skin will help you.  Also adding a good serum will help.  definitely use a beauty oil

It uses chicken as it's main ingredient, fried in oil, and with eat sauce.
Chicken is cripy, oily, juicy, and heavy.

8926 2018-05-03 02:18:14 It's not that hard of a concept to grasp. A lot of people aren't disappointed with Koskinen as a goalie but his price tag
8927 2018-05-03 02:18:11 HMU if you need a brake or oil change 
8928 2018-05-03 02:18:05 Alright someone help me!! I’m diving into my skincare regime and SOME PPL SAY (sr, blogs, vlogs,etc..) Say that I should put my UFO oil on before my GOOD GENES  but a certain YouTube(r) that I love Stephanie Nicole says I should put my good genes  then my oil(s)
8929 2018-05-03 02:18:04 I also believe it's been established that this expansion will not reduce oil and gas prices in BC.
8930 2018-05-03 02:18:02 Traders speak a language only they understand.
 I appreciate the wealth of info from Chi. Thank You!
 I've done very well in oil equities lately and wish everyone luck.
8931 2018-05-03 02:17:50 I hope you will be fine Toronto ally when I work in oil fields in 80s in Oklahoma pan handel  ,and baseball hell
8932 2018-05-03 02:17:40 It is cramped by punching holes from oil and built with the delivering of Phenergan! Supermarkets and passive surveillance
8933 2018-05-03 02:17:32 See the issue isn't whether Koskinen is a good bet or not. The issue is whether he is a good bet at 2.5 million.
8934 2018-05-03 02:17:23 Flip flops do a number on my feet so I’m caking coconut oil all over them and sleeping in socks tonight as long as possible lol
8935 2018-05-03 02:17:17 IndiGo profits were largely due to hedging on oil and treasury management. Operations profit cannot be more than 3-4%. With summer and cutthroat competition, profits are diving

8940 2018-05-03 02:16:01 In effect your solution is to allow the patient to get sicker to cure the patient? I'm not sure how tripling down on an oil pipeline run by a Texas based oil company helps any of us move towards transforming away from carbon?
8941 2018-05-03 02:15:42 Yes, and I get the concern. What I don’t get are those blind to the possibilities. Not everything Peter has touched has turned to dust.

8948 2018-05-03 02:15:09 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes.
8949 2018-05-03 02:15:05 Thanks for the article Rob.  As the article says most of the exports have only gone as far as CA.

Any idea what the shipping costs are to get the oil to Asia?
8950 2018-05-03 02:14:47 Why’d I put sesame oil in my strawberry/spinach smoothie thinking it would taste good?! 
8951 2018-05-03 02:14:25 My favourite memory was seeing a Red Wings game vs the Oil when I was 6-7 ish? And someone during the quietest part of the anthem at Skyreach yelling “you suck Federov!!” There’s no way he didn’t hear it

8956 2018-05-03 02:13:43 Social media is weird bc 1. I remember the day I got my car was the day that Kylie Jenner had her baby and 2. Her post about her baby being 3 months old made me realize I need to schedule an oil change 
8957 2018-05-03 02:13:35 I’m convinced coconut oil is the solution to all of my problems
8958 2018-05-03 02:13:34 It can but oils are good for your skin! I used to use it as a moisturizer but looked into it and it actually doesn't go into your skin much and kinda just sits on top of it instead. I use the virgin coconut oil from Kroger or Walmart
8959 2018-05-03 02:13:33 Bruh Infinity War REALLY wants to set up an oil tanker's worth of sequel money huh.

8961 2018-05-03 02:13:24 So, you own a car. You haven't been working for awhile. Do you put the price of maintenance on your line of credit (oil change, tires, etc) or hope like hell your engine and tranny don't fail, multiplying your cash outlay by ten or twenty times? That's what Ralph did to Alberta.

8971 2018-05-03 02:10:59 If an oil company wants to buy your house, there's oil under there.

Soy sauce I don't recall any must haves but kadoya sesame oil is particularly needed for steamed eggs, as chinkiang vinegar is for dumplings, which btw should only be made with pork and chives.

I am totally not Chinese.

9087 2018-05-03 01:58:03 Definitely Pat was being genuine as Lucas Oil@is an AMAZING facility to have as a USL team, heck, any soccer team. He was not talking about the crowd, but the facility itself.

9092 2018-05-03 01:57:37 Yes sir! I'm sure the US would be more than happy to replace the Iranian imports. The US could potentially secure Western Europe as an oil & gas market going forward (UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium).

9099 2018-05-03 01:57:00 I believe its Canadian $, but same.
Time of year, US has a “driving season” = refineries switch to make gasoline for the great family road holiday. Demand causes price rise gasoline (& oil). This inflationary effect was greater in 2008 due to less oil in the market (pre shale)

9110 2018-05-03 01:55:52 Hey idiot...Carbon taxes are gonna be charged to you both directly and indirectly. Every liter of fuel, oil, propane, m3 of natural gas and anything and everything that has any petroleum content will be charged

9118 2018-05-03 01:54:22 Sir why is it that many times the inventory will rise more than expectations yet oil price will still go higher? Just like today. Seeing the #'s I thought oil would pull back, instead rose.  Thanks

9137 2018-05-03 01:51:37 Certainly not by giving away our finite resources for pennies like we do with oil and gas, mining and forestry today. Privatize the profits socialize the risks. Not a very smart approach but Canada never stopped its colonialist mentality — so we allow the rape of our forests.

9170 2018-05-03 01:47:09 What makes me bullish on #gasoline is the large drop between 1st week of Mar. & last week of April; the last time we saw a drop of that magnitude for same period was in 2011+12 and #oil was 3 figures.  Dec. 2017 & March 2018 broke gasoline demand records in USA, so we'll see
9171 2018-05-03 01:47:08 I wondered how long it would be before this "gender" nonsense hit the boy scouts / girl scouts.  It has worked for decades as it was and kids & parents loved it. Liberalism is polluting everything~ like a giant oil spill in the ocean.

9176 2018-05-03 01:46:11 Next move higher in oil will be lead by $ sell off... 4-8 weeks Brent approaches $78-80.

9217 2018-05-03 01:41:28 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
9218 2018-05-03 01:41:26 ปัญหาของพี่ด้วย ทำไมพี่รู้สึกว่าพี่หวังกดบัตรตปทได้มากกว่ากดที่ไทย ทำไม
9219 2018-05-03 01:41:21 Still beat City no problem. Also, i take it you started supporting City when the oil money arrived?
9220 2018-05-03 01:41:17 Oil is far simpler to say :)
9221 2018-05-03 01:41:08 Should’ve went and got that oil change today!!! Gotta get up at the crack of dawn

9227 2018-05-03 01:40:26 According to a recent poll conducted for ReThink Energy NJ, 3 out of 4 New Jersey voters agree the state should invest in renewable energy, rather than in fossil fuels such as oil & natural gas. Nearly 90 percent say clean energy is important to the overall health of New Jersey.

9229 2018-05-03 01:40:10 Lash Update: I ordered castor oil with expedited shipping and bought a pack of falsies cause I can’t live like this
9230 2018-05-03 01:39:46 I know a girl this happened to and she still got them done so idk. It goes out? Idk put some tea tree oil. And then again maybe you shouldn’t go to that nail tech anymore
9231 2018-05-03 01:39:42 On a real note I need my oil changed 
9232 2018-05-03 01:39:39 Joe Arpaio is Judge Leander Perez but without all the ill-gotten oil graft...
9233 2018-05-03 01:39:35 Eat steak, drill oil, weld pipe
9234 2018-05-03 01:39:13 Germany wanted oil. Follow the money.
9235 2018-05-03 01:39:13 Fuck your ranch.  Olive oil, salt, pepper, sugar, and a splash of lemon is where it's at.
9236 2018-05-03 01:38:47 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face with the original.
9237 2018-05-03 01:38:44 yes - the best way to explain about people selling tech and snake oil
9238 2018-05-03 01:38:38 Hmm, ROSI is generally snake oil.  Compelling narratives often best drive change in mental models.

9240 2018-05-03 01:38:29 Bruh I let my brother have some oil when I went home last weekend, this nigga won’t stop asking me what in it

9243 2018-05-03 01:38:06 the issue is trump isnt treating this like a cold war, and most of the EU isnt ether. when countries realize depending on Russia for things like oil is a bad idea, that being said I agree diplomatic channels should always be open.
9244 2018-05-03 01:38:03 Maybe I’ll go tomorrow after I get my oil change, go to the barbershop, and the town center
9245 2018-05-03 01:37:47 That’s the “but other countries have slaves!” Argument. We ought to be innovators and leaders in investing in the 21st C economy. The entire world ought to declare a state of emergency and all remaining oil and gas efforts put to preparing for the new climate context. Us first!
9246 2018-05-03 01:37:41 Yikes, after all this time, their still trying to use Harper as their scape goat. I don't think the majority will buy the snake oil this time.
9247 2018-05-03 01:37:40 Hey, I coined #DonTheCon quite a while back. Great minds think alike. The man is a con artist indeed. Snake oil salesperson would be a step up for him, as the wares he peddles are far worse than snake oil. He's a hatemonger, divider and violence inciter. He's got to GO.
9248 2018-05-03 01:37:40 555555 นี่ก็คือปัญหาาาาของหนู
9249 2018-05-03 01:37:21 Also palm oil land. The whole of pulau Indah will be residential within next 20 years. The plantation business not as profitable anymore. Low@commodity pricing.

9255 2018-05-03 01:36:52 No oil price relief.. it's just that the govt is not piercing the oil injection further in common man's body for the moment.. however they aren't taking it out either..
9256 2018-05-03 01:36:37 gross US version is made of sugar and palm oil 50% google it .. it’s garbage 
9257 2018-05-03 01:36:33 Honestly cbd oil has done wonders for my chronic jaw pain I love this shit
9258 2018-05-03 01:36:31 Las inversiones en energéticos y en oil &gas en el mundo se hacen principalmente por empresas privadas o de capital mixto... porque culpar al gobierno solamente?  “papá gobierno no debe resolver la vida de todos eh!... hay que trabajar para eso ...”
9259 2018-05-03 01:36:28 I’m going to learn how to change my breaks and a oil change this summer too
9260 2018-05-03 01:36:18 Great porn star name, though.
9261 2018-05-03 01:36:16 Roberts has just plain and simple got to go. He sounds like a carnival snake oil salesman. I do not believe one word out of his mouth. Just wait we will see Baez with the game on the line tonight.
9262 2018-05-03 01:36:15 My aunt: “you have such a natural glow on your skin!”

9264 2018-05-03 01:35:45 So far today my beloved has spilt olive oil all over the kitchen bench, forgotten to put the laundry powder in with the washing, sat on his glasses and walked into a cupboard door. Thankfully the sun is shining.
9265 2018-05-03 01:35:17 Da coco butter and oil actually working for my stomach
9266 2018-05-03 01:35:17 I had some baby asparagus and on a whim threw them on a baking sheet with olive oil and sea salt, roasted until tips just crisp. OMG - so good! Totally agree on veggie roasting! Will be trying the brussel sprouts for sure - love 'em.
9267 2018-05-03 01:35:14 Eating at fancy restaurant

9270 2018-05-03 01:35:04 Does this investigation take into account the product coming into these facilities? Two identical facilities could have vastly different emission levels based on the inlet product composition. Canadian oil productiontends to have high sulphur content to begin with.

9274 2018-05-03 01:34:11 In these oil & gold trades you're not showing a context via daily and hourly charts. Is that something you're able skip given the instruments or more likely a matter of the limitations of twitter?  Thanks as always.

9287 2018-05-03 01:33:02 What about fried. Like toss em on a skillet or pan with some oil
9288 2018-05-03 01:33:01 The first 2 to 3 months are the worst because it pushes all the gunk, oil, and dirt up to the surface of the face. Then the last 3 months or so it starts subside slowly. Your skin will get very very dry and super sensitive. All I can say... is it was well worth it.
9289 2018-05-03 01:32:36 @elonmusk, @epa One more reason to buy "electric" next time you go car shopping. The oil industry doesn't care about pollution and cancer, we can all stop this nonsense, let's all embrace zero emission technology!

9293 2018-05-03 01:32:15 It is not better. Reading now, but it opens at least 224,000 acres of prime grouse habitat to oil and gas drilling, and opens loopholes making it easier for BLM to ignore safeguards on the rest.

9303 2018-05-03 01:30:23 For the lips of a harlot 
are like a honeycomb dropping, 
and her throat is smoother than oil. 

  But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.
9304 2018-05-03 01:30:20 I'm feeling pressure to support pipelines and then maybe the oil companies will drop prices again. Seems like they are using punitive pricing to force political change in their favor.
9305 2018-05-03 01:30:07 It’s not good for you anyways there’s so much oil in them but I love the taste
9306 2018-05-03 01:29:58 Word that’s why I use one only and coconut oil every once and awhile

9308 2018-05-03 01:28:33 Trudeau would be a fine CPC leader. He's done a better job at implementing Harper's agenda than Harper did. Foreign Affairs, Military Arms Sales, Pipelines, Indigenous Rights, Drilling for Oil and Gas in Protected Waters...on and on!

Don't talk to me about money that big business (who just a very big permanent tax cut) might have had to pay for our right to a clean environment. Zinke is allowing big oil to drill in what used to be protected land. Greed, Greed.

9316 2018-05-03 01:27:28 it takes 24 hours to swap back. I only recommend that if you plan to let your oil build up for more farm XD

9323 2018-05-03 01:26:54 "Killer Of the Flower Moon" is an amazing true story about the Osage Indians in Oklahoma during the early 20th century who were murdered for their oil rights. It's also about US Marshals and the birth of the FBI. If you haven't read it, I hope you will.
9324 2018-05-03 01:26:34 Piggybacking off my oil change post... does anyone else feel like an idiot when they show you the “stick” showing you your oil level is full? Honestly the guy could not have changed my oil and been showing me a meat thermometer for all I know and I’d say “yep, looks good”

9330 2018-05-03 01:25:29 Hello ladies yes put coconut oil in your hair for 30 minutes before you shower then shampoo it out, I promise your hair will appreciate it.
9331 2018-05-03 01:25:28 I need my car washed and my oil changed. Lordt where is my man?? 
9332 2018-05-03 01:25:26 He touts every major event as a false flag operation.  Sad that folks actually follow this snake oil salesman.
9333 2018-05-03 01:25:11 We have almost an infinite volume of Natgas in Western Canada that could phase out coal and oil from power generation. Cheaper & cleaner. But can't get it to market.

Dubious American money funding our environmentalist opposition to pipelines!

9337 2018-05-03 01:24:23 we have oil pipelines, why not water from canada?

9342 2018-05-03 01:23:50 Let's hope so! BTW Was it just friends and family at Lucas Oil Stadium tonight? #sparse
9343 2018-05-03 01:23:24 Oh damn!!!! Aloe Vera and also put apple cider in bath water to take bath, it takes the sting out. The lather in aloe or coconut oil!!

9351 2018-05-03 01:22:18 If it’s in Johor, it’s part of the landbank that was former palm oil plantation.
9352 2018-05-03 01:22:09 And washing your hair as little as possible helps too. I have too greasy of a head tho so by day 2 it's bad haha but yeah definitely try the coconut oil! Lather it through your hair once a week and leave it on for about an hour. Does wonders
9353 2018-05-03 01:22:04 Regardless, it shows that the company is solidly free cash flow positive at current oil prices.  Yes the hedge subtracts from fcf, but the fact remains that many shale players can generate cash at the current strip.

9379 2018-05-03 01:18:31 The @dnc is the primary reason why section 8 housing and welfare for ILLEGAL Immigrants has sprung up all throughout NY and specifically LI. These socialistic policies have created higher taxes with low pay wages.  Sadly, @DNC is selling snake oil to the ignorant and ruining NYS.
9380 2018-05-03 01:18:22 You're right. they knew exactly who they hired, & what she would bring. The attacks on Sarah's appearance & the abortion joke are indefensible. Also, it wasn't a roast, it was a media whine fest along w/ attacks on Trump & co. Media did nothing to help themselves w/ that debacle.

9414 2018-05-03 01:13:25 I’m pretty sure. Coconut oil is more of just a base. It will dilute it a little but its not going to dry you out. I used to mix lavender, tea tree and coconut oil for my piercings and for my nose when it was really bad.

9427 2018-05-03 01:11:43 Coconut oil. That is my first suggestion. My second suggestion is go to the Dollar Tree. They have this deep conditioning treatment that is actually pretty good in my experience. Makes my hair feel really soft lol

9443 2018-05-03 01:09:57 And with every increase they get more $$ from their % gov is in a partnership with big oil and the consumer has zero competition to encourage free market activity. Any other industry this would be illegal.

9446 2018-05-03 01:09:31 @Tribble_Bait is exactly right. The CBD oil is the key; legalize that. No "high" after-effects. But the pot crowd is after the high. Then everything becomes fuzzy and nothing matters but Cheetohs.

9450 2018-05-03 01:09:20 So you want that increased? Fact is more oil will be shipped by rail is we can’t build pipelines. You advocate for another disaster like what happ d in Quebec?

Do you also advocate Canada buying oil from nations that don’t respect environment, human rights?

Maybe I'll see it happen again in September.

9529 2018-05-03 00:59:35 I got test sizes before making a full-size purchase!  Because y’all. 
But so far, so good. I also deal with oils as well. My go-to(s) are almond, Vitamin E, and DILUTED peppermint oil (great for soreness).

A dollop of beard balm or a drop of beard oil as I conditioner keeps it healthy. Dry & frizzy looks good on no one.

9538 2018-05-03 00:58:18 You are the joke. Trump has done more in less than a year than Obama or Bush did in 8. All they did was steal oil and kill millions.
9539 2018-05-03 00:58:13 What? Where do you get that from? Do you understand how for-profit companies even work? They are still making profit on oil sands boss. If they weren’t their stock price would evaporate.

9543 2018-05-03 00:57:18 That's perhaps the most shortsighted comment I've seen in a long time. So you are happy with the alcohol, the corruption, the Americans who steal your oil and the fact that you will ultimately become a puppet colony? You may deserve that all. Remember, you were free once.

9549 2018-05-03 00:56:39 It also doesn't help that the Canadian oil industry is very risk averse.  They should be investing more in trying new things that reduce costs and emissions.
9550 2018-05-03 00:56:35 lemon juice & honey! or almond oil is a good alternative

9565 2018-05-03 00:54:35 Relatable. They'll be like "with this many miles on your car you really should be using THIS oil which is $50 more" and I'm just like "okay do whatever you want my man."

9603 2018-05-03 00:50:36 The change is that the differential for our oil widened.  Too much oil is moving by rail (expensive, less safe).  Investment was depending on NG, TMX and KXL.  But government's stalled or killed them. And carbon taxes and new regs create uncertainty.  Money flows elsewhere.

Other than a brief hiatus in 2009, it was high growth due to high oil prices.  Oil prices fell in 2014, and things slowed.  But prices are back over $60.

9646 2018-05-03 00:44:51 Apparently coconut oil and aloe vera are good for anything and everything... 

Ima put some on my confidence and my self esteem 
9647 2018-05-03 00:44:42 Coconut Oil!
9648 2018-05-03 00:44:40 Yes, because these are the products we have been forced to rely on when all other alternatives had been thoroughly squashed where they could, by the oil industry. Now that era is over & we can get on with stopping the ruination of every continent for oil. Good grief.

9655 2018-05-03 00:43:34 No doubt OPEC has been limiting supply. That’s called supply and demand, but oil is traded on the market daily every minute of every day. They limit supply, and suffer losing market share. The US is now exporting which limits OPEC’s power over the price.
9656 2018-05-03 00:43:26 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
9657 2018-05-03 00:43:20 Aloe Vera or bio oil might help!
9658 2018-05-03 00:43:18 Sliced plantains fried in coconut oil are phenomenal.

9661 2018-05-03 00:42:17 RT @_EhsanMokhtari: @haloefekti It's all about control of middle east and oil. I feel sorry for American people who believe politicians. Iran is not just a group of people who rule it, it's a nation of 85 Million people who will suffer from decisions made by a fool like Trump.
9662 2018-05-03 00:42:10 Coconut oil did nothing for me but make my hair more dry smh. Had to switch to olive oil/shea butter
9663 2018-05-03 00:41:49 How much are you charging for snake oil?
9664 2018-05-03 00:41:40 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
9665 2018-05-03 00:41:39 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9672 2018-05-03 00:40:24 Makes sense. His friends in the oil industry needed a little help. 
9673 2018-05-03 00:40:19 My dumb ass put coconut oil all over my hair and roots and didn’t have enough time to shower so now I’m going to class with oily hair I hate myself
9674 2018-05-03 00:40:14 We need to get a campaign going against the oil companies. We are being gouged big time in Australia. I have been very vocal about this for over a year now. Gov watchdog completely useless !!

9677 2018-05-03 00:39:46 I don't think it's dropping per say, I think people are just frustrated watching Donald get away with the crap he has for so long and continues to.  The man is the definition of a snake oil salesmen. Plus he is robbing your country dry of so much.
9678 2018-05-03 00:39:39 Like the doumelin hit, like the slew foot late in the third, he’s a predator. He’s a piece of shit.
9679 2018-05-03 00:39:39 good question.  I wish I was more informed, but from the little I've read, I think there's reason to be concerned about what heat does to the other constituents of the vape oil.
9680 2018-05-03 00:39:38 We need to elect public servants who work for us, not some oil company, finance company, bank, investment firms, or whoever is paying for the campaign.  

People who work for us will need to work together for all of our good instead of fighting for power amongst themselves.

Headline 2: HUD Secretary Ben Carson’s proposal to triple rents for poorest households would hurt single mothers the most.
9684 2018-05-03 00:38:40 En parte tienes razón, pero dime en las economías del mundo cuántas tienen empresas del estado sin capital privado invirtiendo en energía y oil &gas? Checa el caso de Noruega y platicamos ...
9685 2018-05-03 00:38:38 The US supported a coup against Chávez in 2002. It's been screwing Venezuela with oil prices and economic warfare for many years. And now it's supporting its fascist oposition.
9686 2018-05-03 00:38:26 I’ve seen it 50 times.  He targets the head and jumps through it.  Have to get that hit out of the game.  Read Ken Dryden’s Players Trib.
9687 2018-05-03 00:38:23 I hear ya. I just got a really good dose of nostalgia. I changed my oil, helped my dad and uncle with something. Rotated my tires in his garage. Reminded me of the good old days when I used to work on the mustang and whatnot. Life was easy back then.
9688 2018-05-03 00:38:20 I wonder if this will wake these farmers up to the fact that Trump is not their "savior". Trump is more like a charlatan or snake oil salesman.

9700 2018-05-03 00:36:41 I’m about half way thru Revelations. Your oil painting is so freaky! Very well done but mercy me, it’s so realistic and scary... whew!
9701 2018-05-03 00:36:30 And damn,really!?!?! The keystones pipelines? You think that's good? You do understand no oil being transported through that pipeline will ever be used by Americans, right? Like, that's all Canada's oil. The only Americans it benefits is the company's who own, and built it.
9702 2018-05-03 00:36:01 Tough to say b/c central bank money printing is such a crowded trade too. 
The Fed's Underlying #inflation gauge is running at 3.1% and at 12 year highs. Not just #oil is running.
9703 2018-05-03 00:35:47 I caught a pot of oil back in middle school its scary but its not as violent as youd expect just take it outside and cover it with the lid it'll run outta oxygen :)
9704 2018-05-03 00:35:30 The sad part is —all of that lol. At base level oily so I can’t use lightweight cleansers but I will get dry spots- I alternate between a oil free spf moisturizer and aloe Vera gel and it evens everything out
9705 2018-05-03 00:35:21 fresh sheets on my bed, floor vacuumed, and got my diffuser wit peppermint oil going  hope i can sleep tonight.
9706 2018-05-03 00:35:15 Thanks for your tweet Loretta! Fish oil certainly plays a role, but it's most likely a number of different foods, such as vegetables, fruits, legumes and nuts, working together to combat depression.
9707 2018-05-03 00:35:11 Keep looking at a still instead of the actual play and you will see what you want to see.

"Will Higher Interest Rates and Rising Oil Prices Derail the US Economy?"

NOPE,
#littlemantrump will do that all by himself...
9710 2018-05-03 00:34:45 How would a person who lives along the pipeline live my lifestyle just because the pipeline was built? How would having to import oil at a higher cost because more Canadian oil is exported be benifical to them? How about first making Canada oil independent
9711 2018-05-03 00:34:35 Today we took a stapp in to the future something the Gov of Canada dont want to do. We just bought our first EV and loving it. 
If only @JustinTrudeau and the other oil mongering politicians would follow the peoples example and go greener
9712 2018-05-03 00:34:11 Chemotherapy has a 97% failure rate....it's just poison...but makes big pharma billions a year.....research is not looking for a cure..no money in a cure...just control more synthetic shit....dismissing natural stuff like cannabis oil and other stuff which is curing some cancers
9713 2018-05-03 00:34:06 Exactly, so no matter who sells and buys the oil, the dollar maintains its importance as a global currency. Oil is fraction of US GDP, yet it's the bulk of Russian exports and 1/2 of its GDP. So a key part of Russian involvement in Syria is protecting its energy dominance
9714 2018-05-03 00:34:05 @Longshoe do you see Indy sustaining inside the Lucas Oil field house? Doesn’t seem to be well supported and certainly the field crew doesn’t make a great impression.
9715 2018-05-03 00:33:55 You would figure that they would remember what the snake oil salesmen would do in the past. Some people never learn!
9716 2018-05-03 00:33:53 It's called gouging and price fixing. When the Oil market crashed. Gas makers didn't follow suite, they keep gas prices high so the could profit.

9724 2018-05-03 00:33:14 I feel like garbage and everyone’s just dumping heir problems and useless info on me???? I feel like I’m about to pop a gasket and start spitting oil everywhere
9725 2018-05-03 00:33:03 Like I said - America has millions of people in poverty, unable to attain decent meals, healthcare, even clean water; while corporations make billions off their labour. The American war machine murders its way to oil and land, thousands dead in its wake.

The problem is wider
9726 2018-05-03 00:32:37 No, the US did not. They socialized all the private companies. Heavily invested in oil during a market downturn in oil. And fired all their educated positions in favor of nepotism. The economist was replaced by an inexperienced relative if I remember correctly. All farming cut.
9727 2018-05-03 00:31:51 Very over priced. I would shop elsewhere.
9728 2018-05-03 00:31:45 Studies have shown that a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, fish and olive oil is a protective factor against ischemic stroke and promotes cardiovascular health in general

9763 2018-05-03 00:26:04 Moore's law apparently dates back to a 1965 white paper...so technically 1973 falls within the framework: more newspapers & lot less TV channels,  earth just pushing 4 billion population back then, gallon of gas was 38.5¢ cents in May 1973 just before OPEC quadrupled oil prices

9765 2018-05-03 00:25:52 Maybe he should think about the fact that the oil and gas were there first and the companies that own them have rights. In almost all cases the houses were built on top of the resources in full knowledge that resource owners have the constitutional right to extract them.

9775 2018-05-03 00:24:38 It’s not that the butter is bad but the olive oil has a lot of health benefits. I have 4 different kinds in my cupboard and use for different purposes.
9776 2018-05-03 00:24:30 fuck on ya ho off that oil one time. Youll reconsider

9781 2018-05-03 00:23:46 "Ok, seems a bit weird to ask, ill loosen the screws on the frame and make sure that there is no oil on the springs so it makes noise"

9783 2018-05-03 00:23:29 It’s so hot that my coconut oil completely melted and that’s not ok.

9785 2018-05-03 00:23:22 Awesome!! Thank you for Recognizing you don't throw pills @ a child. Try natural things first. Lavendar oil (the real stuff that's 100% Lavendar oil, not Wal-Mart brand) rubbed into feet in morning before socks/shoes & just before bed will bring peace & calmness to his body.
9786 2018-05-03 00:23:19 There is already story & language & people which doesn't deserve the attention of Harvard folks

If some groups want to write a story in their favour for a free shipping oil container load then it is  a problem
9787 2018-05-03 00:22:52 Whatever.There is a Glut of oil in the world because of US fracking.The US lacks enough storage facilities for the Oil.If not for Russia & OPEC limiting the amounts the price will drop through the floor.Oil is like diamonds the price is artificially set.Believe whatever suits you
9788 2018-05-03 00:22:45 You guys sold me out of Mother's Oil today!

9789 2018-05-03 00:22:37 Well thanks for growing that because I love cooking with canola oil. 
9790 2018-05-03 00:22:29 WHAT? HUH? OIL? Who said something about oil bitch you cooking? - - Black Bush
9791 2018-05-03 00:22:19 Also, we killed Saddam and Qadaffi to protect the Petrodollar.
Instead of handling our own finances so it wouldn't matter how anyone priced oil.
Or if they had gold and mineral backed currency.
9792 2018-05-03 00:22:16 He didn't have an oil company lobbyist to subsidize his rent and Trump probably wasn't paying him.
9793 2018-05-03 00:22:00 Lol, yes. Lots of prepared meats, American beer, baked goods, gum, PB, snacks, cooking oil, sauces and mixes... Just thought the ‘soy is the cure for toxic masculinity’ comment was pretty funny is all.
9794 2018-05-03 00:21:52 nice. butter's not a problem when going low carb though. I love italian bread dipped in olive oil. it's been a long time though.
9795 2018-05-03 00:21:49 Nothing like oil money
9796 2018-05-03 00:21:43 I don’t either. She’s just goofy lol she’s helping me put oil in my car
9797 2018-05-03 00:21:36 That's not anointing oil
9798 2018-05-03 00:21:36 Oil is a weird one for me. He has good technique but also has the poor record for us. I'd trust him though if it came to it.

9803 2018-05-03 00:20:51 We have our oil changed in town specifically because they clean the interior! That extra 10 bucks is worth it!

9805 2018-05-03 00:20:47 Why are you sending articles two or three years old? Oil prices collapsed in 2015’, but are now back at around US$69/bar for the States, but WCS is still discounted around $18/bar. The US gets the spread because we are too stupid to get pipelines to the coast.

9811 2018-05-03 00:20:05 A little bit of virgin coconut oil rubbed between your fingers and run through his hair should help with the snarls without weighing down his hair. Did this for our little one and we’ve avoided the salon so far.
9812 2018-05-03 00:19:56 We typically toss in olive oil and kosher salt. Balsamic isn't a bad idea. I like trying new ideas, even if they fail hard like this one did.
9813 2018-05-03 00:19:40 A little olive oil, garlic, rosemary.  Very nice.
9814 2018-05-03 00:19:22 Conservatives loooove to say anyone to their left is a deluded idealist but they fall for the most corny snake oil salesmen as their champions
9815 2018-05-03 00:19:16 We have all this gas and oil yet the idiot buys oil from outside Canada. How stupid are they?

9817 2018-05-03 00:18:38 ugh. i’m sorry :( i like roasting kale bc then it’s not SUPER dry and it feels almost like chips- just a bit of olive oil and lots of salt and garlic powder and you’re good to go:)

9821 2018-05-03 00:18:16 Again lame. The PC's failed miserably at diversification, even with a robust economy. Forty plus years of control and nothing but oil and gas. One trick pony. Because of that, they should not be given another chance in 2019.
9822 2018-05-03 00:18:11 I’ve been looking in to CBD oil pretty heavily before I consider taking any prescribed medication.(not hating, my mom was addicted to Xanax. Pills scare the shit out of me.) but I’ve never heard of castor oil. I’m going to look into that as well. Thank you for your help!
9823 2018-05-03 00:18:09 My hair is growing fast yaaaaaaasss my secret is I stopped washing it everyday, I take biotin + probiotics, I use OUAI oil instead of conditioner. I’ve been doing this for a couple months and I can see a difference wow being consistent in something actually pays off  lmao
9824 2018-05-03 00:18:07 child in line next to me says in the early times, like 1947, people lived to be 200 bc there was no gas, oil or cigarettes.
9825 2018-05-03 00:17:57 To prevent future abuses...starting next Monday all oil and nat gas will be priced and transacted in BitCoin....problem solved

9834 2018-05-03 00:16:44 Yeah that story is from August, probably 2015’ when oil crashed and part of the reason for the loss is because we can’t sell oil to the world market at market price! Instead we sell oil to the states at huge discounts, ($18/bar last week) and they resell it at huge profits.

Cut, dry & chop - keep as dry herb. 
Mush up, mix w/ brown sugar, coconut oil & lime juice &it’s a lovely fresh body scrub. Mint works wonders for cooling tired feet. Freeze in ice cubes to flavour water (before using on )
9861 2018-05-03 00:12:21 The gas prices now?  Higher than three years ago!!  Who was Prez 4 years ago?  Lol. Silly argument. Even IF prices were higher 4 years ago under Obama. The US under all modern Presidents have been weak on oil. You don’t know anything about what affects gas prices so hush.
9862 2018-05-03 00:12:18 He's been arguably the best goaltender (statistics-wise) in the KHL for the last 5 years.  A unicorn?? It's not like Chiarelli signed Tim Tebow to back up Talbot.  Give the guy a chance.  Oil can't find a back up here, might as well try Russia.
9863 2018-05-03 00:11:55 Pretty sure I put my lashes a little too close to my lash line today bc even after a shower and washing my face the glue is still stuck on my real lashes damnit.. time for the Qtips and olive oil

9867 2018-05-03 00:11:24 I work for a company & sell CBD Oil. Its affordable, all natural, Non-GMO, preservative free CBD Oral spray & other products! WE HAVE SKIN CARE PRODUCTS! Helps with depression, anxiety, arthritis, nerve pain,&many more conditions. We offer CBD oral spray for animals, pet chews!
9868 2018-05-03 00:11:04 I think it allows young girls that are tomboys to excel at the things they're not typically exposed to, just because society wants them to be sugar and spice. Some girls weren't meant to sell your hydrogenated oil filled cookies! Can boys handle it? Is the better question.
9869 2018-05-03 00:10:52 A little vegetable oil on the fence would cure that.
9870 2018-05-03 00:10:47 In the US, short term wins and profits are favored over long term planning. Cross cultural scholars have determined same via large surveys. That plays out in oil, climate change and social security. The “borrow from Peter to pay Paul” in the latter is quickly becoming laughable.
9871 2018-05-03 00:10:45 It is HARD not to rub it in to farmers, when we TOLD Trump's base they would get screwed if they elected him!

Look, might be Chia’s best gamble.  Koskinens numbers are average in the KHL so I’d bet against it.  Oil only have ~$17MM to sign 8 players next year including Nurse.  Continual overpays and continued lost assets...
9875 2018-05-03 00:10:33 I swear I'm allergic to everything in skincare. Everything has some form of orange or orange peel in the ingredient list. I need to just buy go ahead and buy @mydrunkelephant products since they don't have any of those essential oil and extracts in any of their products.

9918 2018-05-03 00:04:54 You are a loser, a cheat, a fraud, a charlatan, a criminal, a snake oil salesman, a 5x draft dodger, a traitor, AND you’re Putin’s lapdog in the Oval Office. BTW, leave @FBI & our law enforcement heroes alone. P.S., Admit it; you’re in love with HRC & it hurts real bad, right?
9919 2018-05-03 00:04:51 "Money can't buy happiness."

YEAH SURE LOL YOU'RE ONLY SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU OWN PROPERTY AND CAN AFFORD TO CHANGE YOUR OIL EVERY THREE MONTHS, KAREN.
9920 2018-05-03 00:04:50 Let’s get AB off their boom bust economy starting with shelving KM pipeline & open up Alberta for businesses with a future not dead end oil . It’s 2018 not much time to mitigate climate change. Tarsands are toxic
9921 2018-05-03 00:04:46 No! Which by the way the mama bird won’t necessarily abandon the babies or her nest but thus, you still shouldn’t touch them. 

For sea turtles it’s the oil that ya humans have on our skin gets on their shell and it rubs off the layer that protects them from bacteria & other-
9922 2018-05-03 00:04:45 Hey, I know that guy!  He sold me some tainted snake oil!
9923 2018-05-03 00:04:45 the coconut oil is softening and i just had my first street harassment situation of 2018. combined with the birds' flying patterns, the augurs believe this summer will be a hot one.
9924 2018-05-03 00:04:23 Maybe at 90% discount assuming someone knows how to get the oil out of the ground
9925 2018-05-03 00:04:17 Baby oil on the sunbeds are not a good idea 
9926 2018-05-03 00:04:13 Piggly Wiggly got e’erthang ye need innuhway.
9927 2018-05-03 00:03:53 @altonbrown do I really need to refrigerate a plain (olive oil, balsamic, salt, & pepper) vinaigrette?
9928 2018-05-03 00:03:46 The point was about the accurate use of the word twinning. But you're so awesome at constructing straw men.. maybe we can just burn those instead of your buddies' oil?
9929 2018-05-03 00:03:30 Avacado oil works to make ya face look luscious, my nigga janal came back w some good test results mhmmhmmmm
9930 2018-05-03 00:03:16 Letting my beard flow in its natural glory tonight. No oil. No balm. Just glory
9931 2018-05-03 00:03:11 Castor oil helps your hair regrow and CBD could help your anxiety. I also find that peppermint oil is very soothing to me when I’m anxious. I dab 1 drop on my temples and massage
9932 2018-05-03 00:03:07 This white lady called me “a brown doll and then asked if I use cocoa butter or coconut oil”  I’m not sure if I should be offend or not?
9933 2018-05-03 00:03:06 I used tea tree oil on my keloid and nothing happened so I have to get it removed 
9934 2018-05-03 00:03:00 I learned that things that have been fried in oil that’s already been used are carcinogens aka every fast food restaurant 
9935 2018-05-03 00:02:41 Going to see special screening of Midnight Oil - 1984 + Q&A with... drumroll please... ROB HIRST!!!!! 
It’s been a shit couple of days, but nothing, I repeat NOTHING, is going to spoil this.
9936 2018-05-03 00:02:38 Eventually, after going through peak for a while, you would need a barrel of cash to get a loaf of bread, or 400 $ to get a coke out of a soda machine. Eventually, you have a Mad Max world (or if nuclear armed nations fight over the last cheap oil, nuclear holocaust)
9937 2018-05-03 00:02:33 As you probably know, Vancouver Island is...an Island. Because of that and the fact they don’t drill or refine oil, they get their fuel shipments by barge. These don’t go through the Burrard Inlet. Dangerous stuff still! But not the same as 650 000 barrels of bitumen.
9938 2018-05-03 00:02:16 And just to be clear- “energy projects” means oil and gas or will there be a focus on renewables also?

9941 2018-05-03 00:02:10 When I give stormwater or SPCC training, I tell people to grab a stick or a rock & swish in the sheen. If it fractures, it's not oil. Simplified yes but they remember.
9942 2018-05-03 00:02:05 I know, I know, I know! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

Because @realDonaldTrump is a traitor who sold American policy for oil money and help stealing the election. And Putin clearly has kompromat. And Trump is a galactic idiot with no comprehension of geopolitics.
9943 2018-05-03 00:01:53 Honestly if I wasn't working out on an oil rig with highly questionable cell data access, I'd probably still be playing. Maybe even have bought the PS4 version and be playing it there

9946 2018-05-03 00:01:39 I respectfully disagree. The BSA hasn't been in anyone's crosshairs and In many areas boyscout participation rates have dropped significantly. I think they are jumping on an opportunity to bolster their numbers and attribute it to being inclusive.  Win win for them.

9949 2018-05-03 00:01:16 You spend more oil-based energy than the oil your drilling is worth. Oil is used to make so many things aside from gas (7 gallons of oil in every car tire, most paints, all lubricants and sealants, all plastics, etc. We make computers, diapers out of the stuff.
9950 2018-05-03 00:01:12 I’ve been watching a lot of Chopped lately and I just have one question...
Has anyone ever used sesame oil and not got yelled at by the judges?

9956 2018-05-03 00:00:24 And a side of motor oil
9957 2018-05-03 00:00:16 could you die from drinking too much olive oil? 
9958 2018-05-03 00:00:12 By oil you mean butter and salt right!?
9959 2018-05-03 00:00:04 LOL no, the idea of Peak Oil has been around for a while. The moment a nation or a whole planet reaches the halfway point in oil supplies, the oil starts to get more and more expensive. Eventually, though you still have plenty of oil, its too expensive to drill.
