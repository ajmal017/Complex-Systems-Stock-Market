4 2019-05-31 23:55:53 Just recently, as you put it, “nothing surprises me,” ... I am buying calls on good gold mining stocks. $NEM $GOLD  etc. Gold stocks are directional, if it goes the wrong way, I close out the position. Others are confused as well, it’s not just you!
5 2019-05-31 23:55:50 “Stocks don’t go up in a straight line” lol
6 2019-05-31 23:54:29 I guess I’m old too then because that’s all I want to do besides the boat I need like 15 stocks 
7 2019-05-31 23:54:23 I’m about to invest into stocks soon turning penny’s into thousand
8 2019-05-31 23:53:27 You have these Penny stock traders too, they say “inside info based tip” get all their followers to buy the stocks, as they’re penny stocks, a few 100k can artificially inflate the price 

And then all of a sudden the next day he tells everyone to dump the stock
9 2019-05-31 23:53:11 This is what I’m thinking! There is a lot of money that can be made if you know when the stock market will go up and down. I’m wondering if Trump has been making money off his stocks?
10 2019-05-31 23:52:33 Stocks ta muito pilhado, ta errando bastante pq fica forçando arremesso. Precisa botar a cabeça no lugar porque nesse segundo tempo o time vai precisar muito dele.

12 2019-05-31 23:51:01 Let’s invest in these stocks let’s vacate on these yachts 
13 2019-05-31 23:48:11 @jimcramer @jimcramer Jim, huge fan. Our first grandchild, Declan Ryan, was born in November, and we plan to continue to buy gold bullion on his behalf but would love one or two long term growth stocks/ETFS/mutual funds you would recommend that we might start him off with. TY!
14 2019-05-31 23:48:01 @eToro the narration on your YouTube advert is unbearable. @realDonaldTrump's voice on helium would sound more bearable Also, I have no interest in buying stocks so something has gone wrong in terms of reaching your target audience. If I ever did want to buy stocks, I'll avoid u.
15 2019-05-31 23:47:03 Our markets doing better performance than china....this will continue becoz holding big investors..once our government will announce some actions then they will short to retail investors on this positive NOTE.. till then enjoy the UP MOVE only
16 2019-05-31 23:45:07 Stocks are susceptible to short-term thinking outside of earnings season. If you’re a short-term investor, play it safe. If you have many years to go, wait it out and keep investing. The market will reach all-time highs before you know it.
17 2019-05-31 23:44:51 Stocks are fine. Just flip the screen. ;)
18 2019-06-02 23:57:50 Pres.Trump will impose tariffs on any stocks that decrease in value. #mischiefmanaged
19 2019-06-02 23:57:24 I honestly struggle to justify tokens, esp garbage like this, to friends I've onboarded into crypto this year
Them: "These projects make no sense from an investment perspective."
Me: "Just vaporware. Gamble in them if you'd like, but they're the crypto equivalent to penny stocks"
20 2019-06-02 23:55:48 Fact: Trump *did* ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting.
21 2019-06-02 23:54:49 Fact: Trump *did* ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting. Keep on digging that hole.
22 2019-06-02 23:54:38 She also wasn't called out for failing to know the Trump administration banned bump stocks or that the #2A has nothing to do with hunting.
23 2019-06-02 23:54:20 Do you own stocks or buy things? If so, how can you love him? He’s killing us.
24 2019-06-02 23:53:30 And then to imply the #2A is all about hunting.  Also she didn't even know the Trump administration banned bump stocks.  She's clueless.
25 2019-06-02 23:52:46 GET IN ON THIS STOCK PRICE QUICK. STRONG SELL ON GBP/CHF

26 2019-06-02 23:52:27 You have been lying about the Trump Administration's policies. (They banned Bump Stocks.) It's disgusting. You have been lying about the NRA. (They have nothing to do with gun sales.) You refused to answer about your stance on specifically 3rd trimester abortions. (It's murder.)
27 2019-06-02 23:52:27 she said she would ban bump stocks, thought that trump already banned them
28 2019-06-02 23:50:57 You're a straight up bold faced liar. The President DID ban bump stocks.

29 2019-06-02 23:50:25 Basically she hates jeffree because he unfollowed her on twitter and ended up being very biased against him&abyone who not necessarily supports him but slightly stocks up for him so anyone who does ends up being on his "pay roll" and also...
30 2019-06-02 23:50:18 Let these stocks vest and its a hell of a summer
31 2019-06-02 23:50:03 Thanks, Pete!  Enjoy your time off. Let me guess?  Someone blamed you for FSI or one of the rare element stocks?!?!
32 2019-06-02 23:47:08 “Stocks fell on the news [5% tariff on Mexican goods]and analysts warned the tariffs could stifle economic growth.”
Analysts, on which economic issue has Trump policy “stifled economic growth?” So why would this one? Oh well, keep reaching.
33 2019-06-02 23:46:40 RESPOND TO THE RED ALERT: everything #TRUMP does aims to benefit his financiers in Russia, Saudi Arabia, China. Trump undermines US trade partners and US power to swing $/power/control to US enemy states. #Mueller #cdnpoli #stocks #Impeach @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats
34 2019-06-02 23:46:23 Yes, bump stocks were banned. I'm more curious how they (dems) define assault and military style rifles.

Ask 100 people and get 100 different answers on the definition of them.
35 2019-06-02 23:46:21 The only "drama" is 30 twitter accounts having nothing better to do but argue back and forth. I sure bet the employees at Silver State, Swell and Phantom Farms are being thoroughly entertained
36 2019-06-02 23:44:17 Biggest problem is we didn't make the needed trades before the start of last season, now Lonzo, BI, Hart and Kuz' stocks have all dropped not risen, the money can't work now for AD why during the season KCP was a definite in the trade.

38 2019-06-01 23:59:04 Hi Sian. Apologies for the overcrowding this evening. We have limited stocks avialable currently; however, we are making investments to increase availability in future.
39 2019-06-01 23:58:36 You would end up paying a lot more than 5 billion if you tried. Unless it's CCJ, there's not a lot of liquidity in these stocks. You would have to do like  5% of the volume and it would take time.
40 2019-06-01 23:57:58 Yes, commodities are extremely cheap vs stocks.
41 2019-06-01 23:57:02 I invest basically every paycheck. I make a list of stocks I want to buy and when the money is in I buy. Lumpsum is hard for me.

45 2019-06-01 23:55:23 I also realize that I need to start buying stocks from different countries. Make my portfolio look diverse.
46 2019-06-01 23:54:27 I see all these stocks lowering. It's time to start buying
47 2019-06-01 23:54:22 hate dudes that are like
I like trump because he's doing a good job. the stocks are high and all the bad press he gets in fake news

49 2019-06-01 23:54:12 Stocks are steady if you go for index funds. But flipping gafs has more money unless you’re in the know on individual stocks I’d say. Very rare a stock will return you 20% in a year; not too rare in property.
50 2019-06-01 23:53:58 @CredibleCrypto where is the best place to buy uranium stocks?
51 2019-06-01 23:53:47 Yes China is paying a heavy cost. So are Americans and stocks. One difference the leadership of China can just ride it out and blame the U.S.. For sure you can blame China but at best 40% believe you. It makes a difference during elections. If economy follows stocks. Best wishes.
52 2019-06-01 23:53:46 I went to an irl tourney 1 time and got clapped by a kid 0-3 stocks you'll recover brother trust me:D
53 2019-06-01 23:52:41 "Downturns don’t happen in isolation. The reason stocks might fall 30% is because big groups of people, companies, and politicians screwed something up, and their screw ups might sap my confidence in our ability to recover.
54 2019-06-01 23:52:22 So is ura like btc and the other ura stocks like altcoins?
55 2019-06-01 23:51:36 True. I live in Washington State. I cannot buy a gun without a background check. Bump stocks are illegal, legal papers have to be filled out to transfer a weapon between parties. You have to apply for concealed carry permit. You cannot buy machine guns nor pistol silencers.
