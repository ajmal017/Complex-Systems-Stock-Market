Any other project you HOLD would be charished and I'm sure many ppl in crypto space would hope for the best.

We need to be mainstream and that's all that matters.

162 2018-04-11 23:38:29 I've seen this kind of implicitly in that people think provenly bad monetary tricks will somehow work now just because it's a crypto. Ex: App coins should be inflationary to encourage spending. Never mind that I can just hold in BTC and convert into it if even necessary.

441 2018-04-11 23:00:23 I wrote "Legal and IT" intentionally -- apart from rare birds such as wikihow (Jack loves crypto), we did not get near the CFO. Crypto volatility + risk kept us at the legal/IT front door, knocking in vain. Uphold has been great as exchange partner, and they are eliminating fees.

Price of #Bitcoin (#DigitalGold) could 8X from here and still be well below just a $1 Tril Mkt Cap

465 2018-04-11 22:57:39 As a capitalist country, we have made clear our demand for truthful advertisement of products. So yes, twitter can censor non-leftist speech, but they need to stop advertising themselves as a free speech platform.
466 2018-04-11 22:57:14 You were among 62 publishers who wanted bitcoin. The rest from that era (1100 or so) did not want it. Legal and IT departments both preferred fiat. We pay pubs in crypto of their choice via Uphold, or (pretty soon, with separate KYC provider such as Civic and no Uphold) in BAT.
467 2018-04-11 22:56:48 I find it funny how people were all pushing #xrp - #ripple and now seems people are hating on it.  Ripple is a decentralized coin working with centralized banks.

564 2018-04-11 22:38:50 as someone who knows what happened, I can definitely say that this was not an honor killing... Quit licking your lips every time someone with an Arab name kills a family member so you can suggest it as an "honor killing". PS you mutt, Mohammad was not a Muslim.

590 2018-04-11 22:34:25 @stevesi 3) your last main argument is that nobody thought the internet would be valuable EXCEPT the insiders. But the original author’s point is that even the crypto pioneers seem, by and large, to be leery of applying blockchain to their own problems - logic doesn’t fit 3/end

728 2018-04-11 22:11:07 so which number are we at right now?
729 2018-04-11 22:10:50 Is this printed on the metal or engraved? (Or both?)

731 2018-04-11 22:10:46 They probably don’t @SusanBurntToast just like banks aren’t keen on crypto currency challenging traditional currency. Businesses like @AXA are getting ahead of the game. Ultimately the market speaks, why would the user pick a slow, costly process over an awesome one? No choice!
732 2018-04-11 22:10:44 Easy answer. $SYS

754 2018-04-11 22:07:18 I need someone to explain crypto currency to me. But I need you to explain it like you’re talking to a 4 year old child.

765 2018-04-11 22:05:30 Open Banking and PSD2 is a major shift for bank strategies. I would be surprised if most of the banks would have the APIs ready until the end of 2018. I totally agree with the strategy to start with crypto and then grow into bank apis. #ORCA

767 2018-04-11 22:04:40 With each and every #bitcoin bubble that grows and falls, one thing is certain. Awareness increases, technology is tested, and new capital is brought into the space to fund the next wave. Each Crest and trough only makes #crypto better.

775 2018-04-11 22:03:44 The company that owns ICON already have established businesses within Korea. They won’t be spending so much resources to develop a blockchain for no real uses. ICON will likely be Korea’s no.1 crypto

777 2018-04-11 22:03:31 Verge XVG is the new crypto champ for 2018.  Don't hate. Instead choose to get behind the coin so the entire market lifts up and everyone makes money. Crypto needs a new champion to rally the people and here it is. #XVG

816 2018-04-11 21:57:24 Look at The Adoption Curve for insight on where we are on overall adoption and the at tech adoption rate graphs for individual rate of tech adoption. See where crypto falls along these two optics.

Rather than wasting your fucking time talking shit about every other #crypto why don’t you spread your word about #DigiByte? Conflicts lead to zero adoption. You are hating on potential buyers.

868 2018-04-11 21:50:58 It really seems like crypto twitter has become bullish. Seems like a dangerous sentiment to have right now.
869 2018-04-11 21:50:53 #Golem, the #Ethereum-based CPU power renting network, finally released its beta mainnet implementation April 10, 18 months after its 820,000 #ETH #ICO, equal to about $345 mln today. #cryptocurrency #Crypto @Huobi_Pro
870 2018-04-11 21:50:52 There will be BLOOD if partner is not as big as it is being claimed by the team/dev. So anyone talking about $XVG, having xvg in their twitter handle will be taken to the woodshed. People will lose confidence in crypto as long term impact.

875 2018-04-11 21:50:17 the more correct italian soccer slang term is " gobbo " ;)
876 2018-04-11 21:50:13 Exactly. Yet it is touted as a currency. An asset is a useful, valuable quality, person, or thing; What makes crypto valuable if not the expectation that it can be used as a currency? Just sayin taxes are one of the things that need to be addressed for crypto to hold it’s value.
877 2018-04-11 21:50:11 Tell them to set up a lightning wallet so you can lose your money? My bitcoin cash wallet works just fine, and I can actually buy things with it other than @Excellion's hats.

1013 2018-04-11 21:35:39 I wrote in review of a crypto project: “this is like jumping out of an airplane with an umbrella, like throwing rocks at the Moon, like trying to go from NYC to SF by running along route 80 dressed in a cardboard box” sadly that’s how I feel about many projects out there...

1045 2018-04-11 21:31:04 All coins have the same concept & service to offer. A simple bar code can allow any establishment, independent seller, and corporations to cultivate crypto as a form of payment.

1046 2018-04-11 21:31:00 - the way institutions value cryptocurrency will change over time. It's still a very new, very volatile space, but with further use and implementation we will begin to see further solidification in terms of how assets are valued.

1049 2018-04-11 21:30:37 I would love to see ethereum and crypto price stability through organic consistent use of the blockchain using open.
1050 2018-04-11 21:30:36 If we all put all of our money into one crypto-currency the rich would win.

There should never be a one crypto-currency wins all -- not Ripple, not Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin, not Litecoin, not Nano, not $DIME; but all valuable currencies and tech will prevail.

1055 2018-04-11 21:29:56 - Gaming is an exciting space as far as cryptocurrency and the blockchain are concerned. There is an incredible amount of potential for projects to create real, tangible value for the companies that drive them, the players that play them, and the world as a whole.

1057 2018-04-11 21:29:13 I believe that almost everyone started like that. People are entering the market, because they want to get rich quick. We all need to learn the hard way. No advices will help you, until you hit the rock bottom. That's when you learn and improve. And next time you do better.

With the target of the head and shoulders. You take from the neckline to the top of the H&S, then you put it on the breakdown. (Number of sats)
And you'll have your "realistic" target :)
1155 2018-04-11 21:17:20 Sure. US-war machine led by CIA is doing a great job. Mass murderer all the time and US army is ready to play the good guy. They didn't do shit in Myanmar. They didn't do shit in cetral africa or nigeria. Time to get rid of that oil and work on substitutes.
1156 2018-04-11 21:17:17 And you shouldnt! The most honest, sincere and helpful group in crypto. Everyone probably says that about the group they are in, but consider the financial model behind the dogpound. It makes it unique and super helpful

1160 2018-04-11 21:16:40 The same type of woman or man that was hacking away in garages and apartment in Silicon Valley ten years ago is now working on Crypto in places like Zurich, Shanghai and Los Angeles 

Is that not awesome?
1161 2018-04-11 21:16:21 ...just remember crypto is supposed to help free the world from governments using their currency to keep the average person from succeeding as inflation kills their cost of living every year and companies refuse to give pay increases.
1162 2018-04-11 21:16:17 Yes, mint!
1163 2018-04-11 21:15:59 Agree with you Andrew !!! But #XRP is targeting only the payments problem through the crypto - blockchain concept and i think , they are better positioned and a bit ahead in that space. There are many other issues out there , which other coins will resolve.
1164 2018-04-11 21:15:46 Is $XRP the future of Crypto Currency

1291 2018-04-11 21:00:37 Bullishness on alts is a weird extension of bearishness on BTC seeing as the two usually have a positive correlation in bear markets. 

I don't know what to make of any of this, but I'm cautiously optimistic towards alts.

1306 2018-04-11 20:59:54 Just the thought of paying your taxes in crypto. For some people it might not mean much but for me it's a massive statement if/when it happens. That's when you know the journey was worth it..
1307 2018-04-11 20:59:48 Hahahaha nice! Is that based on my idea? 
1308 2018-04-11 20:59:45 Do you live in New York? Are you into crypto? Would you like to come to a @balance_io meetup?
1309 2018-04-11 20:59:43 Crypto zombie
1310 2018-04-11 20:59:42 Between late April and Mid May is my prediction. Tax season ends on April 17th, and people won''t need to sell-off crypto to pay tax fees. So I'm hoping :)
1311 2018-04-11 20:59:40 Gracias por la sugerencia, estamos trabajando para mejorar.

1319 2018-04-11 20:58:30 Yep - it does. But it’s a big gamble. And sure - a company big invested in crypto has to offer it for marketing reason. Doesn’t mean the rest of the world will follow

1352 2018-04-11 20:55:14 Repeatedly lying about Roger Ver, who's one of cryptocurrency's biggest advocates, with an army of sockpuppet accounts, and lies about a dredged up video from 5 years ago where he reported what he saw in MtGox's bank accounts. This is how the anti-cryptocurrency crowd operates.

1378 2018-04-11 20:53:13 Turns out fiat trades in 2017 are taxable AND you have to report crypto trades because the IRS “might” consider them taxable events. I forget the tax code line for this but it’s possible.
1379 2018-04-11 20:53:11 @crumbsapp_ I’m a little biased.. but we do need a easy and user friendly on ramp for new comers to the crypto space.

1409 2018-04-11 20:48:48 I dont think so. I think most have investments that are actually making them money elsewhere and they have an eye on btc for when the next bull market comes. The other half is shorting with algos till charts turn.

1438 2018-04-11 20:45:52 2\ Without consensus for the change in the scaling roadmap, it was wrong for Bitcoin Core to impose a small-block off-chain scaling roadmap on Bitcoin. Ver is promoting the idea of consensus-based change, instead of elite control by Bitcoin Core, imposed by rampant censorship.

1445 2018-04-11 20:44:42 1\ Ah so if Bitcoin Core said that new research indicated raising the coin issuance limit to above 21 million would be helpful, you would support their change? The fact is, the original scaling roadmap was to scale on-chain with large blocks.

1581 2018-04-11 20:28:41 2\ They will never explain how large-block-Bitcoin (aka Bitcoin Cash), which is true to the original vision of Bitcoin, is a "scam". They want no dissent against Bitcoin Core and its 1-MB-Bitcoin.

1589 2018-04-11 20:27:49 Yeah, I’ve put most my portfolio back on $sub for these next stages in the projects development. Probably the best real world application crypto project there is if they pull it all off.

1593 2018-04-11 20:26:57 Crypto is back again with green :). #btc is hitting $7K and #Eth is $420. Best time to buy. These will go up by at least 15% for the next couple of weeks. All signs say so.
1594 2018-04-11 20:26:40 I enjoy the crypto discourse and am constantly trying to find people and analysis to challenge my thinking. The sector is so nascent and fast moving its impossible to keep up

1618 2018-04-11 20:23:07 Volume aside, there is several wash bots going on on binance. Just check TRIG, BTG, NEBL, ENJ, RCN, to mention a few. All started with some strange volume increase 15.03.18 . so dont take all volume on Binance for granted ;)
1619 2018-04-11 20:22:50 still in the glory days. As more big money comes in I think crypto will be easier to trade but the ranges will be way tighter like forex.
1620 2018-04-11 20:22:50 Still no clear direction for $BTC, although scaling into a spot position is on my to-do list for today.

1687 2018-04-11 20:14:51 Not huge enough to keep the gains of last days. Also not a real big deal for crypto adoption. But anyhow technically it’s possible not to wait 30 minutes for a coffee before enough blocks confirmed .
1688 2018-04-11 20:14:48 that was my plan all along
1689 2018-04-11 20:14:39 So, other than the miner scenario, the pro operators only work with market direction. If they test the market and there’s no follow through they wait. I think these all ended up upside down. Sorry about that, I’m new here 
1690 2018-04-11 20:14:21 Privacy is incompatible with innovation and privacy is incompatible with technological progress. Hence why I don’t hold privacy coins. Privacy’s is a function it should not be the sole purpose you are in crypto.
1691 2018-04-11 20:14:20 I wouldn’t take too much credit exposure on a crypto mining startup. Hash rates and mining fees are not favorable at the moment.

1719 2018-04-11 20:11:55 4. Not certain about this one but it’s likely: price gets to or below mining profitability, miners paint the tape (sell back and forth to each other) to protect their margin. It would cost them some money but would act like insurance. Plus, some miners have been mining since 30c

1740 2018-04-11 20:10:01 Bad timing. Most people can’t buy with fiat on sundays as most credit cards decline crypto buyings. Not the smartest move to “see” the moon :-)
1741 2018-04-11 20:09:54 That is the one reason I   Crypto has a hard time being accepted at a faster pace.

@FinMinIndia @PMOIndia
RBI is promoting cash deals by not allowing banks to provide support for Cryptocurrency Exchanges in India. This decision will also pass on the message that Crypto Income is non taxable. Roll Back the Ban
1743 2018-04-11 20:09:41 3. Price is pausing below resistance but not retracing. Operators have the funds to push it through the resistance level which initiates buying from the public trader. Operator sells at the top of the move. Same goes in reverse for support when bearish.
1744 2018-04-11 20:09:40 Would be great if the volatility in the crypto market is reduced cause of open!
1745 2018-04-11 20:09:16 Sure, we're too damn stupid to make our own decisions to EXIT FIAT AND THIS CORRUPT SYSTEM.  So, the SEC brings on the heat to TRY to bring down crypto in the name of "Protection" from our own stupidity.

1760 2018-04-11 20:07:09 2. Same goes for when price looks like it wants to take off but it’s hesitating. Buy a large portion to get price moving, public trader follows after they move, operators sells when the move starts to weaken, initiates a retrace, buys the bottom of the retrace.

1793 2018-04-11 20:03:47 Better buy $hight
1794 2018-04-11 20:03:44 1. Price is looking like capitulating. Operators will sell off a large chunk to see if they can induce panic selling. Panic selling ensues, operator has a massive buy wall waiting.
1795 2018-04-11 20:03:42 That would also explain why Bitcoin and/or other crypto coins would lose value, potentially all their value.  

So let me ask the question differently.  

Why will demand for Bitcoin, or other coins, increase and cause price appreciation for the coin?
1796 2018-04-11 20:03:41 Looks like it

1814 2018-04-11 20:02:00 Yeah, I hope you don’t mind if i expand on that, people may take that the wrong way: People think the pro operators do whatever they want with price. They don’t. That’s not profitable. But they will test the market and see if they get support fron the public trader. Example:
1815 2018-04-11 20:02:00 
1816 2018-04-11 20:01:53 I'm not really full time, like I've never really counted my $crypto hours per week, but I'm sure it's over 40. Over the years I've gotten used to 100-130 hour work weeks so "full time" is alien to me
1817 2018-04-11 20:01:53 The way I look at it, you should be investing in the most undervalued crypto projects that have legitimate teams (that deliver) & A+ business models. One such handful is DCA 10%/wk to 100% w/ 40% ETH + 6*10% value projects: XRP, OMG, GNT, BAT, 0x, MKR etc., ...not investor advice
1818 2018-04-11 20:01:46 Notifying the enemy of an attack and broadcasting the intent though the media obviously won't catch anyone by surprise or inflict maximum damage. Therefore, this is likely political posturing.
1819 2018-04-11 20:01:45 that is an interesting "coincidence"

Most “economists” miserably fail in understanding economics as with the laity. With crypto, an added layer of cryptography is required

1987 2018-04-11 19:41:19 I remember 4 months ago clicking on the comments section of a Facebook ad for crypto that promised 50% yearly returns.
People were trashing the annual 50% dividend scheme as a scam because the returns were TOO LOW. "I make that in 2 days".
I guess they're all billionaires now.

What's the point
2001 2018-04-11 19:39:47 something related crypto company starting investment fund and compete with VC who invested in them using their money (or part of money).
2002 2018-04-11 19:39:42 I'm referring mainly to the problems we are focused on fixing, and therefor what we spend time discussing. imo crypto focuses too much on the money as an incentive, whereas there are much stronger "motivatational scenarios" (joy, ego, etc) that can also be created using this tech
2003 2018-04-11 19:39:29 It’s redic, when I saw that post it frustrated me, I knew rate off. People need to appreciate   a lot more things in life! You don’t me to tell you but your posts Are dope! Crypto or not

Too many in crypto lack the personal skills to be able to bridge the gaps that sometimes divides the community(ies). A softer approach maybe more fruitful than say,fighting a flame thrower w/ a bigger flame thrower.

2301 2018-04-11 19:08:06 @julianhosp i appreciate all the insight into crypto that you are providing, but when do we begin to see some actual progress on what started being your main goals...i don't really see much progress in making crypto spendable in the general sense of the main goal?
2302 2018-04-11 19:08:02 I know what you mean. Back in Late February I was tipping all sorts of accounts. Even people that were into crypto did not understand the tip and they just let it expire. In the USA if you have Canadian coins mixed with US, most shops will take it. But they won’t take Euro.
2303 2018-04-11 19:07:56 My personal favorite crypto at the moment... Cardano (ADA).

If I didn’t already have such a strong ETH position, I’d probably consider picking up some around now as well.

2506 2018-04-11 18:49:53 ethereum isnt like every other crypto. my ethereum is different.
2507 2018-04-11 18:49:50 So that leads up to what you're doing now and plays a definitive role in your brand! How do you leverage that history? If you've been building websites since you were 12 and now to Crypto, you have quite a story to tell!
2508 2018-04-11 18:49:47 I've been listening to the crypto street podcast for a while... I know you're a proponent of wycoff. Just wondering if you had any book recommendations to study.  Already ordered a book on carnegie and the dark genius of wall street.  Looking to really develop my wycoff.  Thanks.

2525 2018-04-11 18:48:17 This is why we must educate the community that any time you cash out you *must* set aside money for taxes right then and there! Also, crypto-for-crypto trades (already highly risky) are now not worth the additional risk when you factor in the tax implications.  Buy, hold, safe.

2560 2018-04-11 18:44:19 1. Finance only cares of crashes as a means of buying the dip. Standard investment logic. 
2. I didnt negate that a bubble is impossible with crypto currencies, what I diffused was the hype that traditional fiat-minded participationist have in that the effect is not the same
2561 2018-04-11 18:44:18 Because it's not really a cryptocurrency. Everyone is just buying it for speculation.

2788 2018-04-11 18:14:29 Indeed, and the biggest plot twist is, they don't even have the funds, they do it with our deposited Bitcoins and coins such as Tether.

2804 2018-04-11 18:13:04 Playing the odds requires concepts of both payoffs and probabilities.

Incumbents naturally see negative payoffs to disruptions.

IMO, biggest issue w eg Crypto is separating 1X speculator wins from LT societal wins

2931 2018-04-11 18:00:54 People are talking about how crypto volume has dipped, when they are looking at volume in USD - when your underlying has dropped 65% from it's peak value, even if you trade the same amount of units, your volume value will also be down 65%...

2965 2018-04-11 17:58:43 New mining philosophy is maximum risk = maximum reward. Split up hash rate among a bunch of low caps instead of scraping for hundredths of a zec or eth a day. I'm done with that crap.

3038 2018-04-11 17:51:33 Black-ish and New Girl have years of ratings history to review.  Some weeks Black-ish gets a 1.5 in the demo.  Then the next week 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.7....there's consistency.  Roseanne has gone 5.3, 3.9, 3.4.  No consistency.

3052 2018-04-11 17:50:24 Your initial post was Roseanne is a conservative show and that's why the ratings are great.  The ratings are dropping every time it comes on the air.  Once that stops happening, it will be a safer show, but your first point is demonstrably untrue.

3071 2018-04-11 17:49:02 That doesn't even make logical sense.  If Roseanne is hugely expensive and starts bringing in ratings close to a show that is significantly less expensive to air, they're not going to cut the cheap show first.
3072 2018-04-11 17:49:00 True story:

3075 2018-04-11 17:48:32 Also important to distinguish between crypto currencies (eg coins) and crypto assets (eg tokens).

3122 2018-04-11 17:43:08 The networks sell advertisers by promising ratings in a particular range.  If the ratings don't come in, they have to give away free advertisements and charge lower rates going forward.  Stability is key.  Roseanne doesn't have it yet.

3142 2018-04-11 17:42:01 In Week 3.  I came name plenty of shows that debuted to huge ratings and were canceled before the season was up because they kept falling every week.  That may not happen here.  Or it might.  The drop-off is pretty steep so far.
3143 2018-04-11 17:42:00 It already belongs to crypto-slang I believe, and is used to make fun of fools who panicked and sold Bitcoin at $15,000, as opposed to true Bitcoiners who will HODL till the end, or till every single whale has finished unloading his coins, whichever comes last.

3176 2018-04-11 17:39:27 Sounds about the right amount of people that would actually think bcash has anything going for it
3177 2018-04-11 17:39:18 I just see a bearish ascending wedge
3178 2018-04-11 17:39:18 A lot of people are only interested in buying pumping coins. 
But I hope now, you are aware that's better to buy in accumulation phase than in pumps. 

It can be hard to wait but that's useful!

3182 2018-04-11 17:39:13 And by the way you are missing the point. If they have money/xrp to waste doing the governments job (which is why we pay the taxes) they should rather give back to those most in need (xrp holders), instead of the government funding the military they should spend on schools.

3195 2018-04-11 17:38:07 These other shows have mostly found a floor.  Roseanne is in freefall. Maybe it levels off at its current level next week and is a hit.  Maybe it falls another 20% next week.  It could find itself in serious jeopardy if it doesn't find a floor.
3196 2018-04-11 17:38:01 Breakout is imminent. People who are still bearish must be smoking crack. I’ve noticed a lot of people in the community have sold their cryptos and left angrily. Plus a lot of people are shorting right now. That plus everything else means that it’s time for the bulls

3203 2018-04-11 17:37:30 I think this consolidation is more likely to lead to another 50% drop than a bottom, just my opinion and its risky to go short given the drop we have seen, could get sharp bear market rally at any time

3208 2018-04-11 17:37:05 I didn't say it did, but those other shows aren't experiencing 35% drops. Walking Dead is still beating other shows but it's down 70% and that leads to huge network issues.

3215 2018-04-11 17:36:20 Too many people still looking for the bottom for this to be the bottom. Plus we are late in the cycle in the general market for risk assets and at this point in time crypto is certainly a risk asset (even though that can change).

3218 2018-04-11 17:35:54 I Think mass adoption of #crypto means theres a good chance we wont be seeing those 100-1000% gains in short periods of time. It will require us to get past the get rich quick mentality & move to a point of using & appreciating the benefits of the technology in everyday life.

How about "crater", which would be the opposite of "moon"?
3265 2018-04-11 17:32:16 Ripple is giving away xrp as donations and fundings to schools and ventures, not cash. So why cant they take care of their community first before looking outside to show the public how noble they are? Xrp holders need it more than the schools (governments job)

3287 2018-04-11 17:29:35 For people like us it was knowledge. 80% of the xrp buyers were fooled thinking xrp was being used. Ripple and Brad garlinghouse were almost denying it. That poor reporter got bashed on twitter by xrp holders for "creating FUD" and in the end he was absolutely correct
3288 2018-04-11 17:29:30 You know crypto is big news when the good-ole-boys at work talk about buying in.

3302 2018-04-11 17:28:09 I don’t think you needed to have a reporter expose it. It was common knowledge at the time. It’s just that XRP was on such a run that most holders didn’t want to hear that

3324 2018-04-11 17:25:23 Coinbase played a minor role. Most people bought in under the pretext that banks were using xrp. Ripple kept saying banks are using xrp and they were in denial at first, caused confusion and then that reporter exposed the whole xCurrent and no xrp being used which crashed xrp

3333 2018-04-11 17:24:23 Most people are price driven but you have to differentiate the characteristics. You have centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency. Ripple and Bitcoincash will serve as crypto paypal, Bitcoin & Litecoin will serve as the new world currency. Ethereum is a borderline project.

3347 2018-04-11 17:22:54 Naked charting is often the best method to spot potential upside or downside and not be caught in those intra day movements. Is it on the lower end or on the higher end? Make your decision based on a longer term vision #alts #crypto

3349 2018-04-11 17:22:46 Most people bought in at the highs because ripple was saying banks are using xrp and then that reporter exposed them and said no xrp and thats when all the crash started. So in actual fact, ripple owes the people who got caught with their hype.
3350 2018-04-11 17:22:44 Is that the reason why its so quiet around a certain coin lately?

3372 2018-04-11 17:20:51 These senators slowly realizing that Zuck isn’t responsible for their dirty secrets. His company is just like every other centralized media company.

3451 2018-04-11 17:09:18 Lots of crypto exists outside of exchanges. You thought you were taking part in a decentralized space, turns out all you've done is change from banks to exchanges. Be ashamed.
3452 2018-04-11 17:09:17 What do you guys think about #BTG #BitcoinGold ?
#Crypto #cryptocurrency #cryptonews #btc #eth #cryptonews #blockchain
3453 2018-04-11 17:09:09 I'd only caution that it doesn't look like a true bullish engulfing since open is higher than previous close. Holding prior support, trying for higher low, & watching for wedge breakout is possibly a better assessment. Being  contrarian for sake of '' isn't a good strategy, imho
3454 2018-04-11 17:09:06 2 weeks without social media!! It was hard but it was worth it!! What new with crypto twitter??

3525 2018-04-11 17:00:35 The cash flows from newcomers do not go towards the operation of bitcoin (or any crypto) network, the in- or out-flows will only affect the market cap (accumulated capital). Bitcoin Miners (PoW) are in fact rewarded by transaction fees (and mining bounty rewards).

3575 2018-04-11 16:55:34 These are all great points about broader macro problems, but BTC has not YET proven itself. BTC and crypto as a whole are not working at scale and therefore there is still a large speculative element and in a risk off environment, that can be a problem for price in the near term.

3583 2018-04-11 16:54:52 The $crypto markets move inversely with news/sentiment. Get bashed on @LastWeekTonight and soar $EOS. Get exploited and forced to hard fork, increase 60% $XVG. Institutional investors lining up for $BTC and it's flat. It's unsettling to say the least.

3660 2018-04-11 16:46:22 My guess is up? A lot of money gets spent on wars? If it last long maybe taxes go up to fund the war. People will probably dump it into crypto to keep it safe? A guess?

Not the CNBC panda bears who call the whole thing tulips. But real analysts who understand crypto and aren’t afraid to call bullshit on specific projects.
3672 2018-04-11 16:45:38 @Super_Crypto read your Steemit post, super interesting. Had a question tho. You say that as futures contracts volume raises, the cartel will have a stronger control over the prices.  Isn't their enough volume as of now given that Bitmex has over 1B of contracts volume?

3674 2018-04-11 16:45:30 The fact that we have been waiting for so long. The idea impresses with its novelty and distinguishes it from all crypto projects.  The key to success is a team of professionals.  Advanced site.  Join #Plentix.

3721 2018-04-11 16:41:07 Just bin told. A British friend was given a drinkin in public ticket in NYC in 2013 but never paid. She is returning to NYC in June but has a bench warrant out 4 an arrest. In contact with NYC lawyer. offered 2 pay by Crypto. He said litecoin or XRP. Amazing!!!!
3722 2018-04-11 16:41:04 It was a problem with the issuer. Crypto cards weren’t the only ones blocked. It was everything from that issuer
3723 2018-04-11 16:41:04 Закрыл сделки 
$BLZ +18,6%
$OMG +11,9%
На данный момент шорт сделки в приоритете. В связи с нестабильностью #BTC.
Возможно войду еще раз в эти монеты через некоторое время. Опять же отталкиваясь от поведения битка.

3730 2018-04-11 16:40:16 I'm not totally sure how the new economy will look, but I think it'll be a decentralized type of economy...kinda like how crypto is, but also gold-backed again, not oil backed.

3735 2018-04-11 16:39:16 Don't think so, don't really want to do too much crypto while here, it's a vacation after all.
3736 2018-04-11 16:39:11 Visa might talk big but they want to make money. They are not stupid enough to ignore the huge spending power of crypto holders.
3737 2018-04-11 16:38:57 Yea africa has so much potential 

In south africa crypto is mostly speculative 
Well in the small town i am in almost no merchants accepting

3741 2018-04-11 16:38:25 I think the general consensus is that as person, he is an abrasive asshole. That overshadows his beliefs.

3743 2018-04-11 16:38:19 The people who attack him are those that have every right. Bcash is trying to steal the original bitcoin name and devalue their investment and what they believe in. What is wrong with you people.

3747 2018-04-11 16:37:50 Shorts at an ATH, they are overly invested and very nervous. Classic Bear trap.
3748 2018-04-11 16:37:37 Everyone is looking at crypto prices and feeling terrible. Ask yourself:

1) did the blockchain (BC) get hacked? - NO

2) did the problem BC solves (truth/honesty) go away? - NO

3) are the powers that shouldn’t be flavouring or attacking? - FAVORING

Then price = sentiment.
3749 2018-04-11 16:37:30 перспективный проект
3750 2018-04-11 16:37:30 Seriously, my take...if XRP can win the banks(which aren't going anyplace) it opens door for major adoption of cryptocurrency everywhere. Stigma aside, XRP will allow businesses to bank their crypto. 
Business received cryptocurrency-> XRP -> Bank fiat.

3792 2018-04-11 16:33:34 Therefore for crypto you should view volatility as result of change in probability of reaching critical size where network effect takes place.

3860 2018-04-11 16:26:27 Peter, it's not that I don't want you to speak but I'm tired of the trivialities and ad hominem.  If that's all you've got then please take a week off.
3861 2018-04-11 16:26:23 The same people that come on to crypto twitter shitting on coins and tokens are the same ones buying them up. Remember that. No matter what they say, they got them fookers locked away.
3862 2018-04-11 16:26:20 Good business decisions with a professional team. Take part at their #ICO . #PORNX #PORN_coin @pornx #ico #Crypto #cryptocurrency
3863 2018-04-11 16:26:19 Just like that, 30 ethers in my poloniex wallet. Thanks VIB. The recent crypto bear season has been hard... At least this will help my portfolio recover slightly!!
3864 2018-04-11 16:26:12 Seriously tho, who is buying for such minor moves? This is crypto!!
3865 2018-04-11 16:26:06 Basically, sure it’s bullish but doesn’t mean downtrend is over. If you recall we bounced from 6k to nearly 12k and yet here we are just under 7k again.
3866 2018-04-11 16:26:06 OPEN can help solve speculation in the Crypto World!
3867 2018-04-11 16:26:01 Maybe because either are possible but the one he showed was the scarier one and it's now broken?

3883 2018-04-11 16:24:27 Why would they care what you do?  They profit regardless.
3884 2018-04-11 16:24:24 Clearly. I can’t believe these guys that stick around and pollute every posts. I mean if you don’t like a crypto then go somewhere else. Report all his post for spam in the hope that he abandons his stupid behavior.
3885 2018-04-11 16:24:17 We don't have enough tech talent in SA. But by attracting innovative blockchain startups, we can develop the talent needed. Just need government to see the light and create the space for innovation!

3898 2018-04-11 16:22:54 On-chain scaling doesn't prevent you from using L2 solutions, and to my knowledge no one is fundamentally against them if and when they become workable. Crippling the blockchain forces everyone to stop using it while L2 hasn't even materialized & will limit options if it does.

3901 2018-04-11 16:22:48 Bitcoin volumes are currently really low - many people are waiting for btc to move up or down before making their next buy/sells. A top 10 alt rallying is still the biggest green light to the next alt season

3920 2018-04-11 16:20:49 Consensus was officially reached on August 1st 2017. It was concluded that a new altcoin would be created while Bitcoin would move forward with Segregated Witness. Since then, Bcash has only floundered after several failed pump and dump attempts, while Bitcoin continues to grow.

3926 2018-04-11 16:20:18 #cryptocurrency in a state of flux that has trended toward the decline.  For anyone that has been in crypto for a long time this is positive due to reduced pressure, attention, and renewed focus. Thats not everyone, so I'll say what I say to my kids.  When you feel small, be big.
3927 2018-04-11 16:20:16 Internet companies are banning crypto ads because it is all moving to fast to just let the good ones through.  I'm good with that.

3934 2018-04-11 16:19:50 What we are seeing right now is alts rising while BTC is mostly flat (which is normal), and this current pattern normally only lasts for several days. Past history shows we need a top 10 alt to rally to signal a new alt season, which we haven't had yet

Even if it momentarily trends upwards it will finally settle at 12% of it`s peak value.

3998 2018-04-11 16:14:46 Let's see he keeps saying bch is Bitcoin.. and it's not compatible with Bitcoin of 5years ago let alone today..  that selling some one a knockoff .. saying it's the original...  that's fraud.

4002 2018-04-11 16:14:21 Fiat has more adoption than bitcoin, BCH or BTC. If you think existing majority opinion and adoption define what a good currency is, why don't you just stick to fiat? That said, Bitcoin's adoption and transaction volume are sadly dropping.

4004 2018-04-11 16:14:04 Something most #crypto "analysts" don't tell you. The 2 most important rules in any #investment:

2. Don't get greedy

4005 2018-04-11 16:14:02 Japan is progressive and pro crypto. Unfortunately most nations are not, so it's a dream as of now!
4006 2018-04-11 16:13:58 Charlie Noyes, without any doubt. Because I also spent 10,000 hours on #crypto and I just KNOW that #crypto IS the future of money. You know what they say. First they... and then you win. 
4007 2018-04-11 16:13:56 That's just like, your opinion mannnn. No need to express it everybody and pretend ppl care.

4010 2018-04-11 16:13:51 Yes, what I meant was at the time of the separation. These things happen when you have limited characters and are typing everything on an iphone.
4011 2018-04-11 16:13:43 No you’re right, but it’s easier said than done. We’d need a multinational education programme that educates on privacy and provides the necessary digital literacy to understand why it’s important. There’s zero economic incentive to do that at this point. Maybe with crypto.

4013 2018-04-11 16:13:14 Such rubbish, they list all kinds of useless crap but won't list btcp, another disappointing exchange
4014 2018-04-11 16:13:09 Imagine within 5 years, we'll have the ability to hold those who falsely claim to serve our interests accountable.

Crypto will offer a financial deterrent, a nuclear option. Independence.
4015 2018-04-11 16:13:02 Not yet. That will only happen when hospitals start paying salary in crypto. Most hospitals are non-profit so that means it would require the gov agencies giving millions in grants...to approve it first. Maybe in 10-20 years, lol. I hope 10.
4016 2018-04-11 16:12:55 Ed- how do you aggregate this sentiment? I follow a wide net of traders with varying opinions and I'd say over 90% of them have turned bullish on both BTC and Alts... I see very few at this point sticking their necks out and calling for significant downside from here.
4017 2018-04-11 16:12:45 The point I was trying to make is I don’t think Roger is an evil guy and if he would just focus on BCH and leave BTC alone people would respect him again. This entire ‘real BTC’ thing has made him bitter and has caused him to use tactics he himself would not agree on years ago.

4024 2018-04-11 16:12:12 I doubt it ..PayPal has already said they are experimenting with blockchain but they have no plans to do anything with crypto at the moment.
Amazon isn't a realistic partner either ..amazon would just do there own crypto coin/blockchain if they were interested..

4051 2018-04-11 16:09:51 A good place to get started when thinking about buying Crypto is coinbase. Fiat currency is uploaded through your bank. Once the deposit is approved the Fiat currency can be used to buy either: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoincash.

4056 2018-04-11 16:09:43 Cryptocurrency users today have to deal with hashed addresses, QR codes and syncing nodes, and other hurdles in order to use crypto. This creates friction and makes cryptocurrencies seem foreign to the average non-technical user.

4062 2018-04-11 16:09:28 Because Roger and Jihan moved away from the reigning BTC and called it BCH, that’s why. The whitepaper was written 10 years ago, things change. Almost every BIP can be countered with ‘but the whitepaper didn’t state anything about XYZ’. Let’s just agree to disagree.

4136 2018-04-11 16:03:04 If you’re above the age of 18, you should invest into Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. But understand what you’re buying first. It’s new age money
4137 2018-04-11 16:03:00 About the subject: I listened to Mark Zuckerberg and i think he is not a evil guy.
I also think he banned @crypto adds to be in a slightly better position at this very moment for the commision.
4138 2018-04-11 16:02:57 I'll give him that ;-)
4139 2018-04-11 16:02:54 Consensus literally means agreement, and there is no agreement among the bitcoin community of what bitcoin is. Please stop finding convoluted ways of trying to use the popularity of an opinion as the proof of its validity, it's simply irrelevant.
4140 2018-04-11 16:02:51 The worst part is that people that are new to the crypto space are going to believe children posting things like this. So I think I need to do my part to call them out on their qualifications for the sake of others.
4141 2018-04-11 16:02:51 @Crypto_Ed_NL would u b me able to tell/explain the possible impact of the AION token release that will take place on the 13th?
Thanks
4142 2018-04-11 16:02:43 There is no official criterium on what defines the true bitcoin so on anything I say you can respond with ‘you just made that up’. They moved themselves away and named it Bitcoin Cash, so why come back and try to claim the Bitcoin name?

4145 2018-04-11 16:02:27 @Blockchainlaw91 There's a team of lawyers who operate a legal crypto regulatory research and awareness project titled as Crypto Kanoon (cryptokanoon@gmail.com). You can get in touch with them on twitter @cryptokanoon for legal updates on crypto industry in India.
4146 2018-04-11 16:02:27 The consensus is: exchanges are dropping bcash pairs because no one wants it but btc just grows, more people use Bitcoin, Bitcoin has more developers, more e-commerce and brick and mortar stores accept bitcoin, bitcoin is worth more by market demand and value of any means.
4147 2018-04-11 16:02:18 Mate. They started following me, copied my shit and my business page @CryptoFamTrust and tried to repackage. Scammers for all I know.
4148 2018-04-11 16:02:06 For the record, I’m a big Marco voices/Eric Townsend fan, but I think he’s missing the boat on crypto.

4168 2018-04-11 16:00:29 The only part I considered useful for broadcast was his comparison of block chain technology to email. Everything else (including his desperate bch shilling) was fundamentally useless. Bch will never be Bitcoin. BUT I truly believe it serves a useful purpose as the alt that it is

4183 2018-04-11 15:59:49 Dane do you own shares in Ripple? This would be positive for Ripple the company. Negative to XRP the crypto. The more Ripple buys, invests, or donates with XRP tokens the worse it is for XRP price and its holders.

4196 2018-04-11 15:58:38 3/ IMHO, the most important thing right now for BTC’s success is its security. If BTC shows weakness in security, a majority of the public that sees BTC as crypto’s “Face”, will be even more deterred from trying to accept the innovation of cryptoassets.
4197 2018-04-11 15:58:37 Important to note, TRON currently is nothing more than an ERC20 smart contract.

4217 2018-04-11 15:55:52 Investing in mining is investing in crypto. The only difference is that your portfolio grows indefinitely with mining vs your token investment that is only based on the market. You invest in very valuable hardware with mining that will continually create crypto for you to trade.

4268 2018-04-11 15:50:33 Having the most impact doesn't define a fork of bitcoin as the only bitcoin, that's a criterion that you just made up. If and when BTC loses its market dominance to BCH you'll find some other excuse to claim it's the only true bitcoin, tell me you wouldn't.
4269 2018-04-11 15:50:29 These congress members clearly have no clue how to structure a feasible question. Listen people, there is something called a service terms of agreement. Users signed up for this and it’s their fault for not clearly reading what they were getting into.

4301 2018-04-11 15:47:14 Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man. If you go by the white paper, bitcoin is peer-to-peer cash, which BTC no longer is. Please understand, though, that since it's decentralized, no one individual or group definitively decides what bitcoin is.
4302 2018-04-11 15:47:13 Idk Lol it’s going to work lol they just launch it and it’s on the app it’s a simple add on and a already existing crypto #GSE  coin I do believe, and they have already launched pictures of it on the app but who knows competition could be good  and push OCN to innovate harder

4404 2018-04-11 15:39:00 Bitcoin is a real crypto with SHA256 algorithm, but the block size is      small. Similarly, the speed is so low with many stuck transaction      everytime. I have found a crypto that better than BITCOIN, if you want     to know. #coinseed
4405 2018-04-11 15:38:58 IMHO BTC price is dominated by Market Makers and whales. They manipulate the price into the direction which gives them easiest profit. Pushing BTC up form here will create a shorts squeeze. 
They tend to operate against the logic, what whole market is expecting. Its a possibility

4423 2018-04-11 15:37:48 Bitcoin Core doesn't even exist.
It's "Bitcoin", and nothing else!
4424 2018-04-11 15:37:45 But the blocksize was never increased and that's why Bitcoin Core suffered and lost market. If it was, we wouldn't experience 50-dolar 1-day transfers at the end of 2017. So blocksize increase was Blockstream's lie from the start.
4425 2018-04-11 15:37:39 I just want the Twitter Handle of the idiot who wrote this article. It’s utter nonsense

4432 2018-04-11 15:36:51 Excellent behaviour commendable on the highest form.
4433 2018-04-11 15:36:43 Because he always sounds like a toddler who is upset about someone taking away his favorite toy (that wasn't his to begin with). And because he calls BTC "Bitcoin Core", which is not the long form of BTC, but just the software.
4434 2018-04-11 15:36:41 So when did you learn about missiles.?
4435 2018-04-11 15:36:40 This is beautiful. Thanks for doing this
4436 2018-04-11 15:36:34 his behavior is totally irrational...i wouldn´t be surprised if he had sold his bitcoins for someone else few years ago and now is paid to try to destroy it or slow its adoption.

4449 2018-04-11 15:36:01 That's an appeal to majority fallacy. Bitcoin is decentralized so each disagreeing faction may pursue their own vision of what bitoin is. It was never meant to be a democracy. You don't have to follow anyone, that's what centralization means.

4512 2018-04-11 15:31:57 This is so dumb. All this guy cares about is building the best crypto ever and people like you are slamming him because the price of ADA is going down. You should have known this was a long term project when you invested, not some get-rich-quick scheme. That’s your fault.
4513 2018-04-11 15:31:47 All speculation about who satoshi is, what their 'vision' was etc. doesn't belong in any serious crypto discussion imo. Apart from which, if he felt bitcoin didn't pan out how he intended, he could say so, or sell his coins to support his new project.

4564 2018-04-11 15:27:15 Yeah, they won’t be held in exchanges, but I think the major barrier is the only way to accumulate coins after transitioning from proof of work to proof of stake, or being PoS out of the gate is through exchanges.
4565 2018-04-11 15:27:14 The reason preventing me from getting MORE into mining is my low FIAT supply... Low FIAT supply caused by getting more into crypto mining... (Just bought another 6 GPU rig). Luckily I can mine more FIAT with a dayjob. Not selling crypto to buy new rigs.

4609 2018-04-11 15:24:36 Uhhh no. The price of ADA is down because the entire crypto market collapsed. Look at the price of any other crypto now compared to January. This should be quite obvious.
4610 2018-04-11 15:24:35 Or perhaps it is because everything roger tweets is anti-btc repetitive BS??  Just a thought
4611 2018-04-11 15:24:33 It didn't? 
Correct me if wrong, but it seems we're a bit down from when it was going up
4612 2018-04-11 15:24:31 He talks about crypto enabling hyper product velocity. When in reality decentralisation and blockchain development and usage is uber slow compared to centralised similar services

4616 2018-04-11 15:24:14 There is a real chance that this economic bubble that led to BTC has also fueled it pushing people out the risk curve (savings accounts became checking, bonds became savings, the equity market became the bond market, and crypto market the equity market).

4693 2018-04-11 15:16:13 I don't have the v2001 yet. I didn't see that it came out until this morning I'll do it when I get home. For now gotta work the real job so I can dump more Fiat into this magical money game we call crypto.
4694 2018-04-11 15:16:10 It looks very nice with great future. I am looking forward to development this project.  Good luck! @koniosofficial #Konios #ico #crypto
4695 2018-04-11 15:15:52 Aralık ayındaki piyasa olsaydı 5 bin değil 50 bin toplanabilirdi çok rahat. Üzücü. Sağlık olsun.
4696 2018-04-11 15:15:51 Exactly. This inverse logic might work in a bull market, but not in a bear market. So people are bearish and ready to dump , but the whales wont ue that opportunity to dump now and buy back at 3k just to prove people wrong. stupiddd

4706 2018-04-11 15:14:59 You mean “INdiscussable”. By this, Im assuming that the common climate of determining the value and profitability of each crypto asset is typically linked to being judged based on the ever deflationary USD standard which makes this standard faulty thus requiring a new standard

4726 2018-04-11 15:12:50 Are you fishing for likes for yourself Roger?
4727 2018-04-11 15:12:26 your "revolution" (funded by NATO and supplied with GCC-trained contras) is a joke. i had hope back in 2011, but then the US decided to use a real uprising to advance its own (and israeli/saudi) interests. there's no "crypto" about you, you openly hope for victory of fascist USA.

4731 2018-04-11 15:12:19 Here's a thought: maybe some governments are corrupt, their laws are tyrannical & therefore define innocent people as criminals. Do you support N. Korea laws too? Why don't you just go ahead & worship every law passed by tyrants cause you don't want poor foreigners to own crypto!

4829 2018-04-11 15:02:28 For me,  it was not Investing sooner... I remember first hearing about $BTC when it was around $45 or so in 2008-2009. But then again, I was like 13 years old and im 23 now so Yah i totally missed the Train.. luckily, there are always more opportunitys in Crypto.
4830 2018-04-11 15:02:24 I'm not too sure about that.
Jed was in Mt. Gox and Ripple, left both of them and didn't look back.
That, as an investor, gives me uncertainty.
Sure, Stellar is a little different, but XRP is the only enterprise ready crypto out there, and that is a bet I'm willing to make.

4871 2018-04-11 14:59:34 I’m upset at how long it’s taking my BTC to transfer between exchanges. It’s been 30 minutes. Crypto has made me soft.
4872 2018-04-11 14:59:03 The main problem is so many people looking for quick gains in crypto that they forget about tech and supporting teams
4873 2018-04-11 14:58:59 It's pretty simple:
-you buy them
-you lock them in a lightning channel
-you loose them in this beta thing

4972 2018-04-11 14:51:04 @DLaszczok Okay, my Tether is locked and loaded to put all in on $BTC at $6,480...that’s my number, whether it goes lower or not...hey, but maybe we only go up from $6,900...it’s Crypto 
4973 2018-04-11 14:51:00 Crypto is so much better when alts are moving. Its fucking boring the other 80% of the time.

4976 2018-04-11 14:50:40 Hey Jeremy! Tbh, got no clue what is driving short term moves in the eth market. Long term market share: I think eth is the fav of the current crypto's to become the platform for commerce in future, so I'm v bullish on its future market cap.

4995 2018-04-11 14:49:36 He "attacked" Bitcoin by wanting it to scale and develop. He didn't own Mt.Gox and is not omniscient. When did he say there was never a block size limit?

4997 2018-04-11 14:49:19 people who criticize BCH either weren't around or forgot about when everyone agreed the block size needed to increase (around BIP 102). blockstream employees danced their way into a narrative that fit the segwit/lightning model and the noobs went hook/line/sinker

5073 2018-04-11 14:43:06 Reasons why $TFD is a game changer. Every other supply chain asset is priced AT LEAST 3x higher. $TFD has real world use, real clients, a proven business model. Its difficult to price crypto. This is one of the few coins you can say with certainty is undervalued.

5127 2018-04-11 14:38:20 For me it's purely that he's consistently attacking projects I believe in with blatant lies that makes me not like him.  To argue CORE devs are incompetent or that Mt.Gox was fine or or that "there was never a block size limit on bitcoin" when Satoshi added it himself are some.
5128 2018-04-11 14:38:10 Right! we are as sure as you 
5129 2018-04-11 14:38:07 Thank you! I completely agree! And 2019 could be even bigger, particularly as the crypto space grows and evolves. I keep telling people that I don't believe $Tel should be viewed by anyone as a get rich quick coin. This is a LONG term investment.

5173 2018-04-11 14:34:33 You don't understand how someone that lied about Mt.Gox is a villain?  Or how he's trying to convince noobs that bcash, which he refers to as "his project", is the real bitcoin. Or how he attacks others to try to prop himself up. Yea I can't imagine why people dislike him.

5196 2018-04-11 14:33:04 Insinuating insults about someone bc they gave a point of view and not giving an actual counter opinion, shows a lack of intelligence on your part.

5276 2018-04-11 14:26:22 時間足でも上昇には厳しい、かなりの上ヒゲをつけられましたね。
この後はしばらくレンジ、もう一度上昇を試みますが、bf-FXの76.0には到達厳しい感じですね、自分的には76.25まで到達してればドテンSを入れてましたが、ちょっと足りなかったですね。
次の軽め上昇を見てSに切り替える予定です^_^

5660 2018-04-11 13:48:10 Could be, but also have in mind that Bitcoin is the easiest to carry and transfer amongst cash and gold and the only one that cannot be confiscated. But war is one of the worst things that can happen to humanity, so hopefully they can avoid it.
5661 2018-04-11 13:48:09 無事でなによりです^_^
22:19～22:30のローソク足の動きでもう一発上げが濃厚になってます。で、22:39から急騰です。
自分が「もう一発」と呟いたのは急騰濃厚のローソク足の動きに入ったからです^_^

いま下げてますがw
5662 2018-04-11 13:47:53 Bitcoin (or other crypto, whichever becomes The One) has one important advantage over gold that makes it lucrative - convenience. We need something digital since we live in digital age. That's where it strikes the perfect balance.

5667 2018-04-11 13:47:35 The worst crypto teams:

2. ???
3. Profit
5668 2018-04-11 13:47:27 今更気が付いた。BitMEXは逆指値のinができないんだな。この発注においてだけ言えばbFの方が優れている。OCOやIFD-OCO使えるし。でもオーダーが設定できたところで刺さらなければ意味ないけどな
5669 2018-04-11 13:47:26 my crypto nightmares now have a face.
5670 2018-04-11 13:47:25 The Federal Reserve is a parasite. Crypto currency is the cure.
5671 2018-04-11 13:47:23 How are the $btc shorts at an all time high when 95% of crypto thinks it's a bull market? Everybody is about to get chopped.

5679 2018-04-11 13:46:47 The entire crypto market is manipulated, like any other market. To think banks haven’t been pumping and dumping is foolish.

5684 2018-04-11 13:46:28 @AC360 My crypto today was a quote by Anderson Cooper (CNN ) which was very insightful. "The farther you go...the harder it is to return. The world has many edges and it's easy to fall off." I am not not sure he said this before or after he fell off the edge.
5685 2018-04-11 13:46:18 Lisk

If you do not legalise crypto trading, then you have no right to say "Digital India".

5841 2018-04-11 13:30:22 A lot of dumb money flooded the crypto markets. In that sense it absolutely was a FOMO bubble. This happened several times before, most notably in 2013.

But it wasn't "the one bitcoin bubble" that finally burst and now it's done. Far from it.
5842 2018-04-11 13:30:18 Ppl who believe in FUD should stay away from crypto in the 1st place. When Verge releases partnership those people will come on board anyway.

5923 2018-04-11 13:21:01 People are so deluded and distracted anymore that they’ll willfully ignore the most horrific danger, pretending it doesn’t exist in favor of petty social dramas. We haven’t been in this much peril since the Cuban missile crisis. It’s time to give a shit, get scared and prepare.
5924 2018-04-11 13:20:52 how do we tell President Trump no he'll ruin alt season
5925 2018-04-11 13:20:51 That’d actually make sense from a larger point of view. Also its been like this 2 cycles, AFAIK. BTC is still kinda high, money is yet to be made on shorting, but sure’d like your theory to play out

5929 2018-04-11 13:20:37 If you are talking “you dumped” as in me I think you are a little confused better get your facts and your shit together before you make stupid claims. Many people think this is a game. Good luck “playing” with your money on other people’s calls or charts

5965 2018-04-11 13:16:33 No, likely will be the same with TenX. Some states in the US (e.g. NY have very tough regulations + red tape). For any crypto start-ups in the US, it’s quite hard to operate in these states at launch.

6074 2018-04-11 13:08:22 The article I am suppose to use for my crypto currency article is a year old
6075 2018-04-11 13:08:20 When I learned about this company, immediately decided that this is what I need, and having studied more details and deeper, I realized that was not mistaken with a choice, now I'm a customer and I recommend to everyone as well!

6200 2018-04-11 12:57:57 It's not the founders. It's all the parasites around them. From shoddy 'accelerators' to investors to advisors to pitches. all create a narrative that a startup must subject themselves to this circus to succeed. Crypto just removes most of that with crowd funding
6201 2018-04-11 12:57:53 stop it lol!
6202 2018-04-11 12:57:48 Because unless you have proof that someone is actually scamming someone else, you are just defaming someone's reputation. You are not putting anyone on the spotlight by doing that, you end up being a little spoiled brat because you lost money for being dumb.

6381 2018-04-11 12:36:25 This partner is integrating into crypto by EXCLUSIVELY partnering with XVG.. but their other payment methods will still be present.

In the case of legitimate it is right.

6477 2018-04-11 12:25:25 I hope they have high profit margin on those gums, as DIME has dropped 14% in value between purchase and present.

6491 2018-04-11 12:23:36 This is a proper use of a crypto currency....holders of value for trade and exchange.  

Unfortunately, so many people see them more like a share of stock, with some underlying economic interest.  This is an improper use of a crypto currency.

やり方分かれば、簡単なんだから。
そもそも、分かり辛い登録方法を取引所が提供する訳ないし、理由がない。

6642 2018-04-11 12:03:21 I think because everyone thinks it needs to cool off but it just keeps going ? Since 22-25k I keep thinking it'll drop some but I guess it takes one crazy coin that kicks off alt season, even if it is a short lived one.

6756 2018-04-11 11:48:05 Absolutely correct.  Crypto, like any emerging tech, has its (huge) ups and downs and rewards those who take the risks.  Unfortunately for the timid souls, by the time crypto is widely adopted and stable - and it will be one day - it'll be giving stock market level performance.

7035 2018-04-11 11:10:11 One of the worst ways beginning crypto investors start:

1) Big expectations
2) Lack of investment experience
3) Spending too much precious time agonizing and timing
4) Lack of research

7064 2018-04-11 11:05:46 PoW technically anyone can mine so you can “get around” captured points of entry. Though realistically most average users cant mine for a profit so it’s frivolous, unless you pool, and then pool contracts / runners become that point of capture. Maybe also electricity providers?

7170 2018-04-11 10:51:54 If the crypto IOUs on RCL were provably backed on the foreign chain, it would meet all the requirements for a DEX, but I haven't found a way to achieve this yet. 2/2

7186 2018-04-11 10:49:40 But the DEX facility in RCL relies on IOUs. That is necessary for fiat, but in the case of crypto it's less obvious. The idea with having a DEX is to minimize or eliminate the need to trust a third party.  1/2
7187 2018-04-11 10:49:24 #Crypto Well, it may be boring but the technical analysis is easy! Absolutely nothing has changed in the setup in the last 24 hours so no reason to make updated tradingview posts this morning. Volume and Volatility spike coming within a day or two.
7188 2018-04-11 10:49:19 There's a few ppl in crypto I have slight envy towards, not negatively. Envious towards their immense skills and precision, such ease and simplicity when it comes to their charts and forecast

7192 2018-04-11 10:49:04 How about giving equity in crypto that gets vested over a given timeline? I think that is a lot more sound.

Most startups fail anyway, and crypto enterprises do not deviate from this rule. Better give a good fiat salary and incentivize employees further with "cryptoquity"

7279 2018-04-11 10:36:16 Crypto assets tend to move faster, though Bitcoin did have a 22 month bear market after its last hype cycle bubble burst (at about $1170).  Another scenario may be a V-shaped bottom after a final capitulation low.  Approval of a Bitcoin ETF could also turn things around IMO.

7444 2018-04-11 10:16:54 Pro tip 2: 

Realise BTC gains through alts now and then hop over to BTC itself, when it starts mooning again. 
For example: 0.5 BTC should be worth at least 8k to 10k $, when BTC recovers.

7574 2018-04-11 10:03:02 Starting with small capital in $crypto I'd do this for best chance to go BIG.

1) Look at coins with sub 5-10m market cap.
2) Research the fuck outta them.
3) Find the one with best product + hype+ busy roadmap that HAS NOT PUMPED*
4) Go all in.
5) Wait for pump.
6) DUMP IT**

7953 2018-04-11 09:07:18 If you need to spend 100% of your salary every month, you should readjust your needs. If you work for a crypto company and you save in fiat, you should readjust your values.

8039 2018-04-11 08:56:44 So their blockchain is implemented several layers up in the application layer, through business-centralized control. So, VeChain is inherently less decentralized and less secure.

8043 2018-04-11 08:56:36 They are world leaders in chip technology, and make their own chips. VeChain does not make their own chips. They outsource the hardware, and have the hardware made compatible with their blockchain via API.

8541 2018-04-11 07:30:57 Because of KYC "security" laws, now a bunch of ICOs, many of which will end up dead and broke, have in their servers a collection of photos of passports and a throve very private information about crypto owners. How's that for "security"?

8559 2018-04-11 07:27:55 All these fluctuations in crypto have got me thinking that is there any hope for a stable options, what do you think?
8560 2018-04-11 07:27:54 This is the logic that drives business towards centralized/hybrid crypto. People do not really want to be their own bank. They want someone to complain to and remedy things, handholding in the digital age as they are used to.

8868 2018-04-11 06:41:14 Just switch out “Black” for “white” in every post by @ShaunKing and you will be flagged for #HateSpeech ...take a second and think. Snap your fingers and you’ll come out of your trance! Come back to us! Logic and love! Not resentment fueled hate speech! Strength not shame!
8869 2018-04-11 06:41:07 That's my point. You're kidding yourself though if you don't think people are putting out both the bull and bear scenarios and saying it depends on what happens at the next support level. What does that say? Doesn't say anything.

Why?

Because the  who accumulate will want to see price rise eventually..
8961 2018-04-11 06:28:54 So many institutions already using the $ETH platform to create private blockchains. Semi decentralised with no purchase of crypto on their part. Adoption is thriving whilst the price declines.

9022 2018-04-11 06:19:22 The answer is: you can never understand it because every analyst puts out both scenarios. Makes us right and wrong every time.

Une des explications possibles est que si vous payez chez un marchand qui n'accepte pas les euros (car il se situe dans un autre pays), peut-être que la conversion, puis le paiement en crypto revient moins cher que la conversion, puis le paiement dans une autre devise ?

9232 2018-04-11 05:51:35 今の税制では、仮想通貨を決済するたびに、
そのコインを何円で入手したか、
毎回チェックしないとならないため
非常に面倒だといえます。

そのため仮想通貨は細かいトレードをせずに
年単位で伸びると思ったものを
がっつりホールドしておいてもよいでしょう。
9233 2018-04-11 05:51:22 原則、仮想通貨取引で得られた全ての利益は
雑所得に区別され、日本円や他の仮想通貨に変えて
利益確定した段階で発生します。

そして、雑所得は1年で20万円までなら
納税の義務は発生しませんが、

20万を超えた分については、
翌年の2月から3月にかけて納税所に
確定申告をしなければなりません。
9234 2018-04-11 05:51:09 昨年から仮想通貨で儲けた人もかなり多いが
儲けた分ちゃんと税務署に支払う必要有り。

ビットコインを始めとする仮想通貨は
一部界隈で物品の購入等に使用できますが、

このビットコインを使用した段階で利確したとみなされ、
税金が生じ、所得税の課税対象となります。

9242 2018-04-11 05:50:28 今、下落が続いている現状は
年末に大きく上がり過ぎたため、
調整に入っているだけ、
という解釈もできる。

長い目で見れば右肩上がりなのは
チャート分析をすれば明らか。

「悲観は買い」という投資の格言もあるぐらいなので
今が底とは言いませんが
買い時である可能性は非常に高いと判断できる。

9249 2018-04-11 05:49:43 【 仮想通貨の税金の現状 】

昨年、仮想通貨に投資している人は
大きな一年でした。

2017年の初めごろ
ビットコインは10万円、イーサリアムは1000円
リップルは0.7円くらい。

それが今はどうでしょうか？
年始の暴落が続いている中でも一年前に比較すると
どの通貨も大きく値上がりしている現状です

9253 2018-04-11 05:48:28 I am 1000% convinced we will be able to buy BTC at $5000 - $4500. But there will be alot of DRAMA and CIRCUS before we get there. Its NEVER going to be a straight line to bottom. You can either trade the market to the bottom or HODL fiat and buy btc at the bottom. $btc #crypto

9326 2018-04-11 05:36:27 Hey @kritesh92 The RBI has not rendered crypto-currency as ‘illegal’ in their directive, so all the tokens are still very much viable assets. Also the RBI has given banks a timeframe to settle their accounts with the exchanges.

9366 2018-04-11 05:31:01 But for the most part Satoshi was just one actor in crypto. We have many different philosophies we can experiment with now happening in the form of various coins.
9367 2018-04-11 05:30:47 I agree that’s the outcome (price suppression), I don’t think that’s the goal. As in I don’t think Facebook banned ads bc they want to buy crypto lower. They did it for a regulatory/legal/liability reason.

9401 2018-04-11 05:24:17 Sorry I’ll try to clarify. Price manipulation happens in crypto all the time. Buying 10k at market on most alts will move the market almost 1%. That’s insane. What I’m saying is the manipulation is not big fish pushing down prices to buy it cheaper
9402 2018-04-11 05:24:15 A trading buddy and I were looking to create a 2-4 person trading team that competes against 3 other teams on a weekly basis... Team with most coins at the end of a week wins. Winning team get's crypto and bragging rights.

9536 2018-04-11 05:02:59 Banks could offer private key safe storage or act as a settlement and insurance layer on top of crypto if they really wanted (similar to how Visa works with fraud protection). But they'd first have to be seen as "trustworthy" agents by their customers, which is hardly the case.

9633 2018-04-11 04:48:57 So I 1000% believe taxing crypto was worst thing to ever happen to it.  Thought about it all day yesterday.  Killed so many reasons for usefulness
9634 2018-04-11 04:48:49 Let me be a bit clearer. Any coordination is bc they are threatened by crypto, not because they want to buy in cheaper

9648 2018-04-11 04:46:23 I think crypto is incredibly sensitive to news. Few reasons 1) retail emotional investors 2) no good way to value coins for 99.9% (aka speculation)  3) money is in active trading accounts vs set it and forget it retirement accounts (very short horizons)

Are you suggesting the CBOE has no effect on downside? And Wall Street or some big money didn’t drive don’t crypto prices since jan?

9765 2018-04-11 04:25:00 Does the higher the price of the shorts in the trend mean there is more money betting on the shorts? As in more people betting on the BTC price declining? Thanks mate!

9767 2018-04-11 04:24:31 Sure. I think in terms of indices (aka opportunity cost) in judging if I’m adding value. Basically if I can’t beat BTC and more importantly if I can’t beat basically a crypto index (market cap weighted I’d say top 100 to 200 coins....like a crypto S&P500) then im doing a bad job

9906 2018-04-11 04:02:42 Retracement/correction of a parabolic move is typically 80%, so a hard stop before .618 wasnt probable anyway. We've gone down to .7 I believe, and .8 would be textbook.

9920 2018-04-11 04:01:04 That's where everyone is getting the $4k scenario... .786 fib level. Many had said that's the where BTC falls to in many of its corrections

3. What are adversaries?
In cryptography, an adversary is a malicious entity whose aim is to prevent the users of the cryptosystem from achieving their goal (primarily privacy, integrity, and availability of data).
#crypto
9922 2018-04-11 04:00:40 My experience with fib is they arent hard and fast strongholds like support/resis levels, as in if it goes slightly beyond it doesn't mean its "broken". They are just levels to strongly consider placing orders around. Could easily be seen as wave with .618 bounce incoming IMO.
