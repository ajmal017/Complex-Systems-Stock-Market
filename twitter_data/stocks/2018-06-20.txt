3 2018-06-20 23:55:23 Whoever spends 79 a month for that is insane and too lazy to study and put in the work themselves. These people profit from pumping their stocks after making it clear which one they are taking a stake in.

40 2018-06-20 23:42:43 Everything has to be completely revamped and I do not see many people talking about this.

Vast majority of listed "wealth" in the US is fake money based on stocks and other forms of speculation. That is gone post revolution...

Bezos does not have 140 billion in assets...
41 2018-06-20 23:42:35 Not to mention the millions of dollars to be made on holding entire families indefinitely. @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP donors who own private prisons and other companies that stand to make money will be most grateful. Not to mention those who have stocks in those companies.
42 2018-06-20 23:41:38 But really when did my life turn into talking about credit cards, stocks, babies, and jobs. 
43 2018-06-20 23:40:43 So every time stocks start declining-instant slam on all risk off-Gold-Silver-Treasuries-JPY-You know that ain't the history prior to about 2016-where risk off would get a bid as stocks start declining-Clearly certain actors are dumping those assets to prop their stock bubble.
44 2018-06-20 23:40:28 @SquarePegToys We need more stocks here in Canada, please. I’m only buying your toys exclusively now.
45 2018-06-20 23:39:46 weed stocks are gonna blow up dude
46 2018-06-20 23:39:25 Boux stock about 12 styles in my size, and I own them all (there's like 3 styles but with different colours listed separately), VS and other brands have none, Bravissimo stocks them but obvs is hella expensive
47 2018-06-20 23:38:17 I totally agree. Weed  stocks are driving TSX up. lool.
48 2018-06-20 23:36:32 I'm buying stocks on the day of the crash,yeah!
49 2018-06-20 23:35:53 Pot stocks are where the real money is.

52 2018-06-20 23:32:57  EOFYS 
We have a great range of products heavily discounted for EOFYS, get in quickly while stocks last!
53 2018-06-20 23:32:16 Many investment funds short sell stocks.
54 2018-06-20 23:31:49 That whole "bigger than the internet" of 2015 & 2016 was before there was substantial talk of such things. 

The "utility" is of course the biggest, because it is the inherent part; contains stocks, etc.

None of them exist without a purpose, so they all have utility regardless.
55 2018-06-20 23:31:22 Wheeew luck i left stocks a loooong time ago
56 2018-06-20 23:29:08 $MU bought stocks but I kinda want a drop to load on  Calls OTM for a 2 to 3 weeks out. Guys this is a good pig. I listened to the call and
57 2018-06-20 23:27:21 Our exchange has become a pump n' dump for #marijuana stocks... seriously, that isn't even a joke;  if it weren't for the massive amounts of capital from weed stocks, it would be a different story!  Sad but true..
58 2018-06-20 23:27:20 Agree. Get rid of bump stocks.
59 2018-06-20 23:27:04 The biggest pumps that ever occured were on the milk stocks. A2M for eg. Turned most people off .
60 2018-06-20 23:27:03 that is huge. yie. their stocks might be about to overtake Netflix’s for the first time in years, hope on if you can cause bro. always been something weird about Disney

63 2018-06-20 23:24:13 Tradestation force closed my LFIN short a week ago bc I didn't have trading permissions for otc stocks. Oh well, at least I only got squoze from 3.50->4
64 2018-06-20 23:21:51 Nope, not my line of work lol. I wouldn't recommend anybody buy two stocks of anything due to transaction costs. Jmo
65 2018-06-20 23:21:14 A few weeks ago I added a number or stocks you post about that I didn't already own and so far the results have been great! 

Thank you for the amazing comments and research. Much appreciated.
66 2018-06-20 23:20:38 She didn't choose to/purposely signed with them. Million Market, her agency, was bought by SM through stocks. She's still in the same label - it's just under SM. Unless her contract expires, she can't change labels or she pays a large amount of money.
67 2018-06-20 23:19:34 Needs more color, the background is just a bunch of stocks thrown together
68 2018-06-20 23:19:20 Again no. And how many mass shootings have involved bump stocks? (which actually helped limit fatalities)

71 2018-06-20 23:18:04 Stocks are up and 54 and a wake up. Too easy
72 2018-06-20 23:16:02 Yeah, I came from stocks as well. Crypto needs to flesh out a bit more with regs and a culling of shitcoins before long holds are safe bets.
73 2018-06-20 23:15:58 Ban Bump-Stocks!
74 2018-06-20 23:15:48 Ha!
75 2018-06-20 23:15:27 First day back on these stocks
76 2018-06-20 23:14:39 All my stocks that I sold yesterday did really well today. They weren't anywhere near my stops. Laugh at myself when I try to outsmart the market. Learned a valuable lesson though. Stops are there for a reason. Follow your plan. Hahaha!
77 2018-06-20 23:14:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
78 2018-06-20 23:13:58 But A.R. 15’s are the drug of choice in mass shootings. Yes handguns are use more than rapidfire guns thank God they’re starting to  ban bump stocks.
79 2018-06-20 23:12:47 That applies to legally owned weapons, you are right. Is there data on illegally owned weapons and those modified with bump stocks?  I shall amend the tweet.
80 2018-06-20 23:12:18 I'm up $20 with my stocks, you can say I'm pretty excited
81 2018-06-20 23:11:43 WWE is at it's best right now. Stocks ATH, $5B valuation. What the fuck are you talking about?
82 2018-06-20 23:10:53 Dump @TheJuanWilliams and never put @donnabrazile on @TheFive again. Will just turn off and go outside
83 2018-06-20 23:10:36 Well joonyoung was from cj before he went to c9 so I figured they must've been related already (or who knows maybe they're already holding stocks in c9)
84 2018-06-20 23:10:01 It's kind of one of those crappy stocks though. It doesn't move all that much. It should be double what it is but it isnt.
85 2018-06-20 23:09:23 You go...you leopard skin trousered beauty you! Hope you are taking that well deserved break!  Love Ma Stocks xxx
86 2018-06-20 23:08:50 Whenever my mother calls me, odds are it’s to ask a question I’ve already answered, because she doesn’t actually listen to a damn thing I say. 

That’s why I invested in tech stocks and they lost money on a dry cleaning business.
87 2018-06-20 23:08:42 Bump stocks weren’t the problem and you know it
88 2018-06-20 23:08:25 What else did he claim? Bleeding heart liberal with head shoved straight up his rear end
89 2018-06-20 23:08:04 But is that of actual cash or mostly stocks? Cause I know he's worth a lot, but that doesn't mean he actually has it right now..
90 2018-06-20 23:07:40 That should be the nail in the coffin for any expectations of seeing anything close to $70 for the rest of this year. I think I'm out Rudi. Surely the funds I have in $RHC would be better used on other quality stocks on my watchlist like $NXT $REA $RMD ?
91 2018-06-20 23:07:23 Have to strongly disagree.  Weed is now legal and upstanding folks are making money hand over fist off of potheads. Sold my stocks today though after a great 2 year run they are super overvalued.
92 2018-06-20 23:06:48 42 STSS Modifieds, 35 Crate Sportsman, and 26 Street Stocks are in the pit area for tonight's racing.
93 2018-06-20 23:06:39 Litecoin feels like FB to me...I traded stocks prior to Crypto so I apply the same gut feelings...

$LTC is a long term hold...build a solid foundation and play the top layer of hot Cryptos...

Worked for me before...just a new vehicle...
94 2018-06-20 23:03:30 I'm a fisheries biologist. The primary problem in US fisheries, as nearly everywhere, is over exploitation of the resource. We need regulations to keep stocks sustainable, else every fishery in the country will crash, and where will your precious industry be then?
95 2018-06-20 23:03:26 Stocks? Like in the Stock Market?
#MAGA voters thought he meant BUMPstocks.
96 2018-06-20 23:03:19 Would be interested if there could be an end of day, bot tweet saying like most tweeted about stocks and maybe top 3 tweeters for it and qty of tweets for each top 3 pumpers (tweeters)! good to get that into pushed out to the twitter sphere!
97 2018-06-20 23:02:45 General Electric will rebound from its decline, and I predict that the stocks will start to rise in the coming weeks. My bet is that GE will do much better by the end of July.
98 2018-06-20 23:01:55 I need a business partner . Someone who’s hungry - that’s learning about stocks , investing , interest rates .
99 2018-06-20 23:01:43 I wish the US would stop doing heinously inhumane things like illegally interning children and get back to the business of protecting its shoes stocks from us Canadians...
100 2018-06-20 23:01:26 @pkcapitol Overlooked in all DC drama is that Congress even less productive under DT than BO. Let’s list all legislations not getting done: Infrastructure, NAFTA, bump-stocks/AR-15s, Farm bill, opioid prevention. Winning? @michaelafuoco @adam_kels @MineWorkers@danbalz #ncpol

105 2018-06-20 22:59:44 @21CF has accepted @Disney's latest bid of $71.3 billion in cash and stocks (Fox shareholders will have a choice - they can take the stock, or cash out).  I'd like to add a Disney made #FantasticFour to the wishlist, please. #Disney #Fox
106 2018-06-20 22:59:21 Too 4 yrs after release to get it running, I say it's time to get over this. Into stocks, blue ring foundation voiding bertron human play on hatred flip flop about.

110 2018-06-20 22:55:17 Will I be able to buy stocks?
111 2018-06-20 22:54:27 That’s why my husband and I are cash and carry and our savings is in gold not stocks!
112 2018-06-20 22:54:13 good point just checked out Netflix prices, but that was a crazy unexpected stock  imo real estate at a good price is a safer option than stocks, but if i ever had extra equity, then I would put it in to stocks.
113 2018-06-20 22:53:54 Root canal treatment? Spent $1500 for this, just 2 weeks ago. The funny part is that the dentist saw my weed stocks on my cellphone and said she was investing in MJ too hahahah
114 2018-06-20 22:53:40 Bump Stocks are an easy way to get around the Automatic gun regulations. 
Remember, they outlaws machine guns because too many people were being murdered in the streets, and it was about public safety. 
The Outlawing of machine guns didn't take away your 2nd Amendment
115 2018-06-20 22:53:18 i wish i couldve invested in Jollibee, Metrobank and Ayala Land! Tho I have stocks with BDO, BPI, SM Prime Holdings and lumaki na rin siya over the years!

122 2018-06-20 22:48:44 But how much is "vote robot", "mutants have weak knees" or "buy stocks in splurg" going to sound like wisdom and not just insane rambling?
123 2018-06-20 22:48:41 #cryptocurrencies trading is very high risk, anything that went up 10X in a short term can go down 90% just as easily.

125 2018-06-20 22:47:47 No ones held accountable in this admin.  
Ol’ Wilbur Ross just basically made a personal fortune in stocks by using reports / indicators from the admin.  He did what Martha did on a larger scale( I think). Who will call him in front of a committee! No one.
126 2018-06-20 22:46:33 $spx so 10 year above 3 was considerd bad for stocks... now people saying this falling is not good either.. what the F.... is good then ?!
127 2018-06-20 22:46:10 As awful as you claim Trump is and wonderful Obama is and in 8 years we were more devided Black kids dying at a higher rate home prices down stocks down and its all begining to get better ending wars and nuke threats stocks up home value up jobs for everyone it must hurt ..
128 2018-06-20 22:45:22 I agree that indexing is the way to go. Trading individual stocks is much harder. You have to guess the broad stock market's direction AND the individual stocks direction.

What the broad market does impacts all individual stocks.
129 2018-06-20 22:45:11 You don't think too critically. The 1% can't gain if their businesses, stocks, & other investments lose value from a collapsing economy. How do you think Lehman investors lost their fortunes?
130 2018-06-20 22:44:05 Telstra $TLS dividend cut projections are starting to roll in... Morgans predicts 17c from FY19 onwards. CLSA thinks 18c first, then 14c from FY21 #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
131 2018-06-20 22:43:30 The 1% can't gain if the economy collapses because their businesses, stocks, & other investments lose money. How do they think so many people lost their posteriors in 2008-9 when the markets collapsed?
132 2018-06-20 22:42:21 "STOCKS" WEALTH" "JPY" and TRADE, they first 3 seconds.
133 2018-06-20 22:41:53 if i dropped $80k (down payment) on apple stocks 5 years ago, I couldve bought 1333 units at the price of $60. today the stock price is $186 meaning i would have a total of $247,938. so a profit of $167,938. I bought a house for 380k and in two years time its valued at $860k
134 2018-06-20 22:41:34 In The Market II: A 0.2% slip for the #DJIA, a thin 0.2% gain for #sp500 may disappoint some large-cap investors. Yet breadth continues to improve on both the  #nasdaq (winners beat losers 9-5) and #nyse (W to L, 3-2 ratio). That's bullish for both main exchanges #stocks #trading
135 2018-06-20 22:41:34 Up 106% this week and am no longer totally reliant on the calls you make after learning a ton from you. Managed to start taking positions on my own, but still greatly value your opinion on the stocks you watch. Thanks a ton!

157 2018-06-20 22:34:52 Go ahead and ban bump stocks, they are useless trash add-ons anyways. Doesn't stop anything
158 2018-06-20 22:34:18 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC #goodproblem Jim I have 10 stocks, my problem is 5 out of the 10 have doubled.  I want to take profits but do I also sell 1 or 2 low ranked stocks to make room for new ones? Need your advise.
159 2018-06-20 22:33:59 I’d take as much profit in those stocks as possible right now. #TooGood2BeTrue
160 2018-06-20 22:32:55 Clearly the pressure remains 'on' as Ramsay Health Care $RHC just issued a rare profit warning. Expected to miss bottom of guidance range by -1%, plus UK charge #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
161 2018-06-20 22:32:54 My thoughts exactly. I also believe his friends know when he’s going to make his absurd tariff announcements so they can short the affected stocks.
162 2018-06-20 22:31:16 The dude is against a ban on bump stocks in PA because we don't have a problem with them here, smh

164 2018-06-20 22:30:08 I’ve been investing into stocks & bonds lately instead of buying new purses smh y’all be proud of me because I ain’t.
165 2018-06-20 22:29:47 What are the most shorted stocks? Judging by fintwit, I'd say it's FANG?
166 2018-06-20 22:29:16 That was Canada's uranium and what got sold was stocks to a company not the uranium itself and Hillary didn't make any money off the deal and it was approved by nine different agencies some headed by Republicans. 
You should grow up.
167 2018-06-20 22:28:39 "stocks are higher" is something working class people say to reassure themselves they're going to become wealthier lol
168 2018-06-20 22:28:30 I get this is a joke, but Jeff Foxworthy is actually a branding genius that sells stocks in his company and is a crazy savvy entrepreneur. Enough where he was invited to invest on Shark Tank for half a season.
169 2018-06-20 22:28:20 Jobs were already trending up before Trump took office, but the @GOP wanted to say that people were simply leaving the job market. Stocks are down, the prices of every thing going up, trade wars, high gas prices, stock buybacks on our dime. Kevin McCarthy is full of shit.

173 2018-06-20 22:22:34 @jimcramer Dear Jim, Since the price of each of these stocks are high for a regular investor, which ETF has all the defense stock in it?  #Boeing #Northrop #defense-stocks #Aerospace  etc.
174 2018-06-20 22:22:13 The long-run cost of weed is comparable to a teabag (see NBER paper).  Moreover, many states allow users to grow their own weed.  So even if the Federal government allows banks to work with weed growers, how enduring do you think the "moat" around weed stocks will be?!
175 2018-06-20 22:21:55 Bankrupted overnight? Bullish!  Because whenever bad news like this comes out, people always buy millions worth of shares in premarket, using many different trade orders because they are very eager.  Because that's how deep value investors buy their stocks in this company.  $TSLA
176 2018-06-20 22:21:47 Oh fck this idiot.  He played the Easter bunny then forced out. He and his family are laughing stocks.  Let’s just nvr respond or acknowledge him again
177 2018-06-20 22:21:35 Look at the market since he took office dummy they have soared.  U have to be an incompetent fool to think that people's 401k have not gone up since 2016.  Or u like most libs don't have a 401k and don't know how stocks work
178 2018-06-20 22:21:35 Like most guns the recoil can get you if you aren't using the correct stance, heavier gun and recoil stocks help a lot. You should find a range and try one, it's a blast!

181 2018-06-20 22:18:27 Growth stocks tend to outperform during bull markets, value stocks tend to outperform during bear markets.

Growth stocks will continue to outperform until the broad $SPX bull market is over.

195 2018-06-20 22:11:22 For Donnie always saying he's working on something, he sure gets little done, other than his Trump/GOP Congress Tax Law, but then again the rich wanted their money quicker to buy back stocks while they were low.
196 2018-06-20 22:10:10 T-minus probably zero for private prison stocks to leap, btw.
197 2018-06-20 22:09:13 Ban bum stocks!!

202 2018-06-20 22:06:25 Grok, you need to put more of your money in some decent dividends paying stocks. Easy 9% to 10% payments,  either monthly or quarterly. In your case,  just pile the dividends back into the stocks, and increase the number of stocks without "buying" more.
203 2018-06-20 22:05:58 people calling a top in stocks. seriously? when did everyone get so accurate in making predictions. seems like every year people call top and it never happens. the year nobody calls top is the year it will flop. that’s exactly how 2008 happened.
204 2018-06-20 22:05:58 Is that good for stocks?
205 2018-06-20 22:05:29 And yes, I do short stocks, once I have insider info
206 2018-06-20 22:05:12 I do not lose; therefore, I do not buy stocks into bad tapes.

207 2018-06-20 22:05:02 With changes to index behind $ivv occurring through $twtr, $dia through $wba and now stocks inside $ksa joining $eem $iemg hard to understand how anyone uses index tracking or past performance to choose #etf and not holdings like @cfraresearch
208 2018-06-20 22:05:00 Well, I took the five biggest cap tech names in 2000 and compared them to the five biggest today. Back then, only 3 (Intel,Cisco, Microsoft) were in the top 5. Exxon was #1. Today, the top five tech stocks are also the 5 highest valued stocks in the market.
209 2018-06-20 22:03:18 There have been a lot of studies that are really bullish for stocks this year.
210 2018-06-20 22:02:58 I would tell anyone to just sell their altcoins for Bitcoin. We all know Bitcoin is going to $100K in a year or two. Can't say that for altcoins. Plenty of good stocks to buy also in traditional markets. ADBE, NVDA, TSLA...
211 2018-06-20 22:02:56 That great structural story with:

- High entry barriers
- Immaculate balancesheet
- Wonderful Mgmt team
- High return ratios
- Dominant market position
- Long runway

all the conditions everybody wants, at a LOW PRIICE?

NAH! stocks of such companies don’t sell at a low price!
212 2018-06-20 22:01:43 And massive store closings, inflation and price up..stocks down...etc etc

214 2018-06-20 21:59:34 When Trump told #MAGA voters to buy stocks, the smart money started selling.

DJIA close:

Jan 30: 26,439

June 20: 24,658

If you took Trump's advice to buy stocks during his 2018 #SOTU address, you are now down 7%, even as gas prices and healthcare costs continue to soar.

216 2018-06-20 21:58:20 Grand Old Putin party. Off to Russia to see how angry Vlad is that they couldn't get sanctions lifted. Maybe they'll try to get him to buy back the Rosneft Oil stocks he sold them.

219 2018-06-20 21:54:49 I think the next recession will bring the realization that most of the FANG are cyclical stocks now.

224 2018-06-20 21:51:16 9% return in stocks? 

Yawn.

Wake me up when there are two or three zeroes behind the 9 and I might care.
225 2018-06-20 21:50:39 I think he was triggered because his investment in the black market was frozen for a bit. His stocks weren’t making him any money.  #trafficking is a lucrative business.

261 2018-06-20 21:26:15 I also really want to research further how many members of GOP Congress and trump admin are making money from stocks in these private prison "detention camps." So they created zero tolerance so they could make tons of money through stocks. #corruptionatitsfinest
262 2018-06-20 21:26:03 $ORCL Makes no sense to me to be dumpster diving on a bearish stock such as this, especially with so many other great stocks to profit from.
263 2018-06-20 21:26:00 He also engineered this crisis as a distraction. Even more Russian contacts were discovered within his campaign, Manafort’s in jail, over $109 million in Trump property sales screams money laundering, and Wilbur Ross shortselled Russian stocks a day before company was sanctioned.

269 2018-06-20 21:22:14 Contine the Starbutts boycott.  Stocks are down and they are closing 180 stores next year.
270 2018-06-20 21:21:17 Yep. Private prisons that pres and GOP own stocks in are making tons of money off of human rights violations. This has to be against so many laws.
271 2018-06-20 21:20:11 I’m not a member and I’m against big pharma- but to be fair, any human or business with a financial advisor has money in big pharma. It makes up a large portion of most index funds that are made of select individual stocks.
272 2018-06-20 21:18:48 $MU the swings on this right now rival that of low float penny stocks
273 2018-06-20 21:18:27 Hearing the value of your investment in weed stocks just went way up #hypocrite

276 2018-06-20 21:17:52 and their Illuminati Luciferian Satanist nephilim descendant secret society wealthy investors bought “put options” on United Airlines and American Airlines stocks immediately before the attacks to profit when the stock prices fell after the attack. The entire Illuminati nephilim
277 2018-06-20 21:17:38 Why would revenue and cash flow deteriorate for the NAZ when employment is 3.8% and consumer confidence is up? Did you know that in the last 20 years, when the ISM (institute of supply chain management) index is above 56, US stocks are up 6 and 12 months later?
278 2018-06-20 21:17:05 Also because you have a place to live, that you can call your own.  Lot of people pay rent and then buy stocks, but all that rent money they pay is paying your landlords mortgage 
279 2018-06-20 21:17:00 Well we see how UA was hot for a season or two than stocks dropped and brand popularity way down. The same will happen with Puma more than likely.

283 2018-06-20 21:14:44 @SouthwestAir @JetBlue  are you going to transport the imigrant children?  If so, watch your stocks tumble
284 2018-06-20 21:14:40 I put $ROBK on my feed at .005 in February this year it hit .013 the first time a then 52 week high and today it hit .034 and broke the previous 52 week high for a +580% gain, Any stocks you recommend ?
285 2018-06-20 21:14:04 Pkg will be huge, just takes time. Next year this time $1 will be laughable, especially with pot legalization happening. Pump crew moved on, these stocks run up as people who trade momentum come in for the short spikes and quick, high roi. Ppl will realize sooner than later
286 2018-06-20 21:13:29 Fast Money just spent the first segment (the entire segment) on FANG stocks

292 2018-06-20 21:10:13 The DJI 30 should  go away.  It is not an accurate reflection of the stock market's health.  Too few stocks have too much influence.   S&P 500 is a better barometer.

300 2018-06-20 21:05:30 #Stocks,#Indexes Late day weakness probably to continue into tomorrow in view of what signaling there was.
301 2018-06-20 21:05:28 Yup. The fact they offer stocks ate a clear sign thry don't have the liquid cash.
302 2018-06-20 21:05:05 U.S. stocks were lifted by a rally in tech shares as concerns eased about a potential global trade war.  European equities advanced for the first time this week.  The pound edged higher after Prime Minister Theresa May won a key vote on Brexit.  Blppmberg
303 2018-06-20 21:04:44 The fact that they had to offer stocks with the new deal means they don't have much more than  the 61bn they offered cash.

327 2018-06-20 20:59:32 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX rally over? Probably. Very (very) minor top signal appeared before the close in SPX and NDX, a signal almost subliminal and as such unqualified to signal the end of the rally, even given the latter's weak bottom signal.  Holding NDX longs.
328 2018-06-20 20:59:02 im so excited for ssbu pichu lmao

basically the way it works in iron man matches is that ur stocks carry over from the last game, so if u win the match but u only had 2 stocks left, u have to sd twice at the start of the next match so ur still at 2 stocks
you get 20 stocks total
329 2018-06-20 20:58:53 I couldn't buy the century bond so I bought the next best thing: ARS stocks!
330 2018-06-20 20:58:31 Stocks no longer truly represent the value generated by workers unless they work in PR, I suppose. The biggest issue with the stock market is that it's no longer about funding growth for up and coming companies, but instead about feeding near monopolies

333 2018-06-20 20:57:20 Yeah i would feel really good about my future if I got massive tax cuts and were able to buy back all my stocks but I'm working class so all I got was a small temp cut and dereg.s are sure to create instability for my future like at the end of Bush jr.
334 2018-06-20 20:56:09 Uh no, their sales and stocks have plummeted try again
335 2018-06-20 20:55:50 Safe?? The one thing he committed to was banning bump stocks after multiple school shootings. Even that he hasn’t done. What about closing loopholes in background checks? What about red flag laws?
336 2018-06-20 20:55:24 SVC (Silicon Valley Coin) is a fund which invests in multiple pre-IPO stocks such as the companies listed above. This differs from the recently announced Equity Tokens which are specific to a single company.

346 2018-06-20 20:48:13 Yes I have found somewhere that stocks them. But a shame that I have to go elsewhere and spend more money in a rival store. I may just do all my shopping there if Tesco keeps dropping products.
347 2018-06-20 20:46:56 Nasdaq, Russell close at new high. Amazing and idiotic. On the road to equilibrium  the massacre of stocks will have no parallel in human history. Great reckoning is around the corner. It is sooner than you think.

350 2018-06-20 20:44:24 I used to think investing was just pure evil. But, I’ve been learning that stocks and investing is now being utilized as ways to bring capital into underserved communities and keep non-profits afloat. I think I may have found my calling.

365 2018-06-20 20:33:07 Can stocks go up on low volume?  Sure!  They can go way way up on low volume.  However, we are playing a game of probabilities, and if the up move happens on HUGE volume, chances are higher that the move will go higher, faster.  Therefore, Volume *does* matter (Price still #1)

369 2018-06-20 20:32:18 exact same thought and just a few stocks are carrying the load today. July will be decider as earn reports roll in & guidance is given. Much higher PPI, currency issues, higher rates, possible higher wages all impacting profits not to mention data its that shows slowdown is real.
370 2018-06-20 20:32:17 Reason # 1,939 why you should not to listen to the talking heads. Nasdaq makes new highs, and all they’re taking about is a bearish wedge and L-T selling signal on the Dow . Lesson - do your OWN homework #tradingpsychology #stocks #millennialtrader #stocktrading

396 2018-06-20 20:15:08 Stocks go actually go up by magic. Or rather, debt. 

Wall Street is over-leveraged with corporate debt at about 5:1. 

IF something seismic happens and rattles the market enough to enter a "correction" it's going to make '08 look like a firecracker.
397 2018-06-20 20:15:04 In the meantime, private prison stocks are soaring
398 2018-06-20 20:15:00 With the passing of the cannabis bill, marijuana stocks are expected to surge. @crudereporter tells us more.
399 2018-06-20 20:14:20 World stocks ticked higher: Europe +.3%; US +.2%. In a continuing tug-of-war between the strong economy & a potential trade war investors leaned toward the economy. Perhaps only a "dead cat" bounce. In short-term, market will vacillate depending on the day's tweet. Depressing!

402 2018-06-20 20:12:58 I don't divulge my exact holdings, lest someone think it's a recommendation for them (with their different life and tax situation). But I only have stocks right now, yes. 

I used C fund in the example because finding S&P 500 returns is a piece of cake.
403 2018-06-20 20:12:27 Dude in this stock room chat I’ve been in for a while, this dude promised if he made over a million on pot stocks he’d throw a yacht party for everyone in the chat and he hit 1mil today...
404 2018-06-20 20:12:20 Love that investment phrase "make your money work for you." Like…nah man, someone is still doing the work, stocks don't just go up by magic. You are just taking part of the money from their work.

428 2018-06-20 20:05:19 We expect WTI to breach US$60/b in the coming weeks. Hold cash for now. Energy stocks have significant downside near term.
429 2018-06-20 20:05:03 OK - that's now the base case. When the chaos occurs, don't hold any UK facing stocks, UK assets or £. Buy gold/hold foreign currency

531 2018-06-20 19:27:14 There are some good stocks to buy, but it is worrying how narrow this rally has gotten.  $SPX is up 3.5% this year - 82% of that move comes from $MSFT $AAPL $GOOG $GOOGL $NFLX and $FB.  These companies are great, but a narrow move like this harkens back to 2007.  $DJIA $QQQ

2:44 PM ET, 06/20/2018 - Reuters
By Savio D'Souza

June 20 (Reuters) - Four of the five so-called FAANG stocks – Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix – surged to all-time highs on Wednesday, with only Apple spoiling a perfect scorecard.
588 2018-06-20 18:59:45 Something has to give. I'd like to think that most people realise that additional funding is needed for the NHS, etc - the Tory grey vote might rebel against the idea but a Labour Govt would run the whole thing into the ground!
589 2018-06-20 18:59:32 One of my guys is heavy in the stock game. He's always recommended not entering until you have about 10,000 to give freely. AT&T, Google, 3M, Walmart and Johnson & Johnson are good stocks to initially look into.
590 2018-06-20 18:59:27 Appears some profit taking from $FANG stocks now.  If your still holding it appears to be good time to take profits.  $TSLA strong here
591 2018-06-20 18:58:43 TORONTO, June 20 (Reuters) - Canadian marijuana stocks rose on Wednesday after the country became the first major economy to legalize its recreational use, but earlier rallies in anticipation of victory in the key upper house vote muted some post-approval gains in the sector.

813 2018-06-20 17:25:45 That’s my point here as well results are being cooked sir and stocks are jacked up. What happened with PC, vakrangee, Shilpi cables. Stock prices don’t plunge 95 pc in six months in normal cos. U said it yourself thanks

815 2018-06-20 17:25:18 Never invest money *you can’t afford to lose*into Individual stocks. even if you believe in the company, it’s a risky game. ETF’s are the best for new investors, because they are commission free and don’t have large initial buy minimums. MF’s can have like a $10k buy minimum.

823 2018-06-20 17:20:53 1. Clear out college funds and any possibilities of loans                                   2. Put some of it in stocks for safekeeping (would need some help with that).                                               3. Aid and donate effective charities. 4. Travel with friends.

825 2018-06-20 17:20:16 I know Vinod Ji. It took me a while to realize that it could unknowingly harm others' financial health. I would never do such a thing knowingly.

835 2018-06-20 17:15:33 It’s like small cap stocks, whether there is any value to the underlying instrument or not, by the time the retail investor gets involved... it’s over
836 2018-06-20 17:15:08 If after EIA report price is up 2 dollars from Friday close price, it is better to sell brent on any EIA report even if all stocks are completely bullish after spike up, as algos cover long positions, take the profit and move price in opposite direction.
837 2018-06-20 17:14:52 A friend of mine used to reject marriage prospects in search of perfection, so much  that his frustratedfather said even if Aishwarya rai came he would reject her because of wax in her ears .

1068 2018-06-20 15:53:56 you're being manipulated by the media in stocks and crypto. What makes you think its any different with politics?
1069 2018-06-20 15:52:46 The #RSI of the "most shorted" stocks has never been higher and each time it has reached this level, stocks have fallen hard. But as a reminder - amid all of this - The #DowJones is down for the 7th day in a row, its longest losing streak in 18 months.

1103 2018-06-20 15:35:38 Then you should be worried. Stocks are flat for 2018, the first year not basking in Obama's economic plans. The debt is also up $1.5T under Trump. With corporate taxes gutted permanently, how do you think that debt will get paid?
1104 2018-06-20 15:35:34 Absolutely, the main issue is finding a suitable device. Most seem to have a very high pin count and a 3.3V (or lower) voltage tolerance, so you need to add in level shifters etc. The only low pin count 5V ones are discontinued and probably just as bad for dodgy new old stocks.
1105 2018-06-20 15:35:17 Get out of this stock now, while you have a chance.  Al these Chinese stocks will drop rapidly in an upcoming selloff, except for BABA and possibly Baidu.

1189 2018-06-20 15:03:05 Is there any way to organize a mass effort to dump these stocks? Is anyone doing that?
1190 2018-06-20 15:01:03 Except for CRUDE OIL AND NATGAS I am not seeing "investor sentiment" or commitment lately, either bull or bear,  in markets/stocks lately.
1191 2018-06-20 15:00:55 maybe? we really look at RBOB and weigh that bc if gas stocks are full/lower demand they're not gonna draw on anything and RBOB calendars been getting hammered.

Nonetheless he gets the positive headline & credit for actions he has no intention of making & never will.  #LieGate #KeepFamliesTogether

1195 2018-06-20 15:00:29 Trade War sounds alarm for markets. 1,023 Chinese stocks fell 10% to their daily limit. US industrials got hit hard. The US’ #1 agricultural export is in danger: soybeans & China is a repeat customer. China putting a large tariff on the grain would be a huge blow to US farmers.

1201 2018-06-20 14:58:43 I like to only focus on 1 or 2 stocks at a time
1202 2018-06-20 14:58:13 Chinese stocks not doing well , I guess until trump doesn’t clarify his position with the tariffs we won’t see more upside for the moment . Actually this is good because many of them are overbought . Need 1 month rest . Until next $IQ earnings . $HUYA $SOGO $BILI $ETSY
1203 2018-06-20 14:58:05 that is key I have found , I personally cant keep an eye on more than 3 stocks at the open waiting to spot when my trigger is....if I had 6 potential stocks I find looking at one or two over here and I miss the entry over there , and that's even with multiple monitors.
1204 2018-06-20 14:57:47 Stocks like GEVO on day 1 and 2
1205 2018-06-20 14:57:32 I like URI, AXP, TRV, ETN & CVS. All good entry points.

1212 2018-06-20 14:55:31 I can't emphasize enough how important it is to have a group of like minded traders around you to share ideas with.

The hard part is knowing which ones to ATTACK or AVOID!

Teamwork is important!

Illegal immigration down

1319 2018-06-20 14:23:32 Wilbur Ross out here manipulating stocks to enrich himself while under government employ. Scott Pruitt still has a job and hasn't been arrested, indicted or run out of the country. Too many damn scandals.
1320 2018-06-20 14:23:12 This. I don’t even play melee, but I’ve been wobbled once and i wanted to throw my controller. It felt like outplaying my bayo opponent in 5-6 neutral exchanges and then losing one and losing a stock. Also keep in mind, the less stocks there are the more this hurts. Fun > balance

1330 2018-06-20 14:19:02 Sure, cheaper per dollar of value. Meanwhile stocks and bonds (where this speculative money should really be going) pay no property taxes at all, and no capital gains either until they’re liquidated. 

I don’t know the answer, but a sharp increase in property tax is a blunt tool.

1336 2018-06-20 14:14:17 No, economic logic and a century of global return data are a good argument for diversifying across stocks. Last decade just confirms what we already know. Random bouts of underperformance are present in all risk/return relationships

1347 2018-06-20 14:10:42 Trade talks have rattled markets in recent weeks, but small-cap stocks had remained largely immune. A rosy outlook on U.S. growth alongside expectations that smaller companies, would be shielded from trade spats propelled shares of the companies higher.
1348 2018-06-20 14:09:33 Many of our stocks lifted nicely today. This action is WHY I try to hang onto some shares. You sell all if it. It can be SO hard to get back in.  #stocks

1351 2018-06-20 14:08:54 $OPK started averaging in at $4.44. Just moved above it's 50 day moving average and don't want it to run away from me! Better to chase stocks going up than to chase them coming down!
1352 2018-06-20 14:08:45 $GILD $CELG $BIIB $AMGN you really have to appreciate the irony behind it tbh. Their inability to identify value causes them to become value stocks themselves!
1353 2018-06-20 14:08:03 I dunno, it's pretty ignorant to write off the worst single-day point decline in the history of the Dow as everyday market fluctuation. Trump lucked into Obama's economy and it's faltered since his tax bill and trade war nonsense. Wages down for non-managers, stocks, job creation

1453 2018-06-20 13:36:52 Yes. But will the gap get filled or will the stocks goes higher this morning?  This is what I can't figure out.  Any insight from a seasoned/professional trader would be gratefully appreciated.
1454 2018-06-20 13:36:12 I feel we should revive stocks in the city squares. Shame them all until hell freezes over.
1455 2018-06-20 13:35:41 Disney and Fox nicely higher on the open. Stocks higher as reality the world isn’t ending with trade wars. China markets under pressure. It’s time for change in this relationship and it’s coming. China can’t see lower growth. $dis $foxa

1466 2018-06-20 13:30:15 Tip of the day: Pay attention to the history of a stock. See what it did the last time it had a positive major catalyst, as history almost always repeats itself, as the same traders often return to familiar stocks. 
1467 2018-06-20 13:30:13 True. But temporary is a relative thing. Does a week constitute as temporary, does a month or a year? How does trend algorithms that invest into stocks in a upswing increase the effect. Interesting to think about still.

They buy and/ or sell you for one single factor: Your worth. Invest in yourself, unlike companies in stocks; you're the one defining your own growth and value.

1529 2018-06-20 13:07:20 why i never short cult stocks 
nothing can deter the cult
1530 2018-06-20 13:06:56 Such effect could be temporary. If ETF just holds, it effectively decreases the available number of stocks (free float). For the effect to last, the should be near constant flow of funds into those ETFs?

1532 2018-06-20 13:05:40 Companies like GEO Group and Core Civic, which run for-profit detention centers around the country, give generously to Republican candidates and the Republican Party. And these stocks are held by Vanguard and BlackRock so millions likely have them in their mutual fund portfolios.

1554 2018-06-20 12:58:34 The major indices have also tanked by 50% (sometimes more) in real terms several times since 1929. It is very hard for ordinary investors (many of whom also lose their jobs during those tough times) to ride those losses, until stocks bounce back.
1555 2018-06-20 12:58:09 I assume you're talking about EM stocks here. If so, you manage to spell out your investment thesis without mentioning valuations a single time, which I find astonishing.

1560 2018-06-20 12:54:37 Bump stocks should be banned
1561 2018-06-20 12:54:29 Stock market is controlled by robos.  Robos react to news unlike humans. Which is why most stocks move up/down quickly.  Stock market Volume means nothing nowadays.
1562 2018-06-20 12:54:21 I'm assuming these are the days traders look for. When runners run they are ready to attack. Studying or having a basic knowledge of how all of these stocks will end up or knowing that they can always go higher allows you to have a risk and protect yourself. Just my understanding
1563 2018-06-20 12:53:50 Stocks and bitcoin could also just continue to rocket in unison, like all of 2017.
1564 2018-06-20 12:53:39 $MTBC $MBRX I own 2 stocks. They both have potential to be homeruns.

1566 2018-06-20 12:52:23 Before you took office, we had net zero immigration. That's a fact you neglected to mention to your rally crowds. You ginned this whole thing up for money - a $30B graft for the wall, soaring stocks&profits for for-profit private prisons. You fed the #MAGA crowd paranoia for $$$.
1567 2018-06-20 12:52:18 Ever since I started messing around with stocks and such the most exciting part of my day is 9:30 am when the market opens. I enjoy the watching my money rise and fall and rise and hopefully remain at a gain when the market closes at 4:00.
1568 2018-06-20 12:52:17 Ya man. June picking up a bit . Would still love to see some of these pot stocks bounce hard. Will basically everything lol . Some stocks has no business to be at these levels . Good luck hope u kill it last half.

1621 2018-06-20 12:27:17 There is nothing to share. I am naked option trader. I see the trend on stocks. Sell calls when bearish. Puts when bullish. I trade on 20 50 SMA. I profit from time decay till expiry. Keep a safe distance for selling so that I can be safe distance from volatility swings.

Someone investing for the first time can’t afford a $1k stock.
1695 2018-06-20 11:44:35 Not sure what laws you are referring to, but if it's the laws to keep guns out of the mentally ill, not a bad idea.  I was referring to banning bump stocks, limit the magazine size, universal Back round checks.  You know GUN SENSE no disarming

1702 2018-06-20 11:42:28 This is something ive been thinking. More of, if the amount of capital in such etf’s increase does it blow ”air” into the higher mcap stocks. Especially in smaller Market areas.

1705 2018-06-20 11:41:33 @traderstewie 
brought up a point a few days ago that should be well taken, about trading stocks with emotion values or lack of values behind the trade. I have a handful of names that i tend to stay away from that hit a nerve with me and those are 2 of them.
FB & NFLX
1706 2018-06-20 11:41:06 What I find hilarious in the world of stocks is, everyone wants your money and friends are only as close as your money gives them. But a "true" friend tells you if you want to succeed, you need to take a break, step back and let that hunger return.
1707 2018-06-20 11:41:06 Hell I’m selling some stocks in other companies and investing into these!
1708 2018-06-20 11:41:05 Futures are up. $SVXY is a slight up. $T is a slight up. I sold my $NVDA 260c yesterday and that is up too. I took 20% rather than RISK for more #Profits. Always lock in gains.

1710 2018-06-20 11:39:55 Cash flow and Monte Carlo used to give indicative potential outcomes and whether the client  objectives seem broadly feasible... Seeing them as indicative therefore means analysis paralysis avoided (i.e. it's ball park stuff).

1715 2018-06-20 11:38:44 I think the more legit concern in tune with your point isn't multi-asset income ETFs which have no aim, but the just the general reach for yield trade, into MLPs, junk, mREITs, REITs, high dvd stocks, etc, which has 100s of billions.
1716 2018-06-20 11:38:27 This Carl Icahn? Icahn was a former advisor to trump & sold off millions of $$$ in stocks he owned in a steel dependent co.

1725 2018-06-20 11:32:40 If you look at the science their isn't harm to wild stocks. The average Salmon spends less than 4 minutes near a farm. The enviro degradation that is made up, the farmed salmon enter the water with zero disease or viruses. They are inspected weekly.

1739 2018-06-20 11:21:22 Hard to watch stocks on your watch list go up and keep going and your not participating. Then I think... you didn’t have the gonads to get in!
1740 2018-06-20 11:20:50 Investors are too obsessed with the general stock markets. Thats what you hear about in the media. To gain an edge and get good returns you need to go deep and specialize. That means reading annual reports and learning as much as you can about potential stocks you want to buy.
1741 2018-06-20 11:18:39 I hand chart a lot of big cap stocks, names you would readily know. How is it the DJIA committee picked WBA, a stock I don't chart?

1743 2018-06-20 11:17:48 I love the headlines this morning as stocks try and rebound. Most say stocks rebounding because trade tensions have eased. Really?  Don’t think they’ve eased since yesterday. Grasping at straws for headlines.
1744 2018-06-20 11:17:18 Didnt NVDA fall 80%-90% from 15 to $2.5 and CSCO fall from $80 to $8 during that 2000-2002 period? Point being is when stocks become overhyped and valuation makes little sense they go bust or crash (at least 80%) and effectively wipe out equity investors
1745 2018-06-20 11:17:13 Yes Scott, let's not forget that. My theory- Trump is manipulating the stock market with his seemingly schizophrenic decisions, so that Putin can trade his country's way out of bankruptcy. "Hey Vlad, I'm gonna make a controversial decision tomorrow. Stocks should tank".
1746 2018-06-20 11:16:52 On the other hand, it the ETF is not broad, it only holds the largest mcap stocks, then it could be gamed rather easily. To limit this effect, ETFs usually don't change their composition too often.
1747 2018-06-20 11:16:13 Looks like you guys are about to sell off the stocks?

1823 2018-06-20 10:16:05 The Canadian bill to legalize marijuana passed yesterday after-hours.  Today I find out if selling my weed stocks earlier was a truly regrettable decision.

1830 2018-06-20 10:10:21 He was talking about a shooting in which a young boy was covered w/a sheet & then found moving. I have seen David asking for a ban on assault rifles & bump stocks but never on ALL guns. My dad was murdered by a guy wanting to steal his guns. YOU THINK DAVID & I should both die?
1831 2018-06-20 10:10:12 Does @nytimes actually have proof that Wilbur Ross knew about the report coming out before shorting stocks or as usually @ianbremmer and @nytimes are just trying to sway public opinion to be against anything/anyone related to Trump.
1832 2018-06-20 10:09:17 Trump aporoval higher than Obama at the same time. Record low minority unemployment. Lower taxes. Less regulation. 40% increase in stocks. Rising wages. Great GDP. Nightmare for liberals.

1836 2018-06-20 10:06:39 Seems like a bad bet. Self driving cabs will soon be out there sporting names like Uber, Lyft and Wamo (google spin off). Buy tech stocks!  Look at GE out of Dow 30. Times change.
1837 2018-06-20 10:05:17 Lets not also forget the "selling on" of her redundant EPO stocks to other pros once she was busted. Morally bankrupt. No place in sport.

1865 2018-06-20 09:46:18 Corporate are just buying back their stocks and buying other companies with the money. This is creating fat fees for bankers, profits for shareholders and future job cuts as I have never seen corporates merging and not cutting jobs.
1866 2018-06-20 09:46:16 Whchever company splits stock first, $AMZN or $GOOGL, is the one to be the first $1 Trillion company. ETF adiction hurts good stocks on sell offs and boosts bad stocks on rallys. If Bezos had real competitor, we'd see the split by now. Like $MSFT vs $AAPL 20 yrs back.
1867 2018-06-20 09:45:46 This represents an epic, generational shift.
The way U.S. refiners will respond to this and/or whether this move is catching them unprepared is something we'll learn down the road.
Judging from the eye-catching divergence in Gasoline/Distillates stocks, it bears watching.

2064 2018-06-20 07:02:06 There is a lot to be said for playing for the Melb Storm, where very few people recognise or look at you, and you can fly under the radar.  Perhaps that's the way to look for stocks: the ones flying under the radar, which few people look at?

2129 2018-06-20 06:07:45 Cyclical nature of commodities suggest that should change and resources should make a new high over the next decade, with resource stocks attracting significant capital flows and potential the AUD hitting $2 against USD. Big things will happen...
2130 2018-06-20 06:07:12 Mainly because it’s dominated by resource stocks. Oil price has been heading up which helps it along
2131 2018-06-20 06:06:20 @hidflect that’s because commodities are trading at an all time low compared to S&P500 index. True story. Capital flows have also abandoned mining stocks completely, which has seen #ASX market in lacklustre stare for years. But....

RM10,000,000 untuk memulakan perniagaan adalah terlalu besar.

1. RM5,000,000 (50%) should be locked away dalam investment portfolio yang boleh bagi return logically 3%-5% per annum. E.g FD, beli stocks yang ada dividen (long term plan)

That would hurt middle class voters FAR MORE than the wealthy. 

and, that is NOT something you can do by making ONE segment pay... you have to have EVERYBODY paying into it, to feel a part of it.
2222 2018-06-20 04:59:08 And I wish I had known then what I know now.... 401Ks would be bonds, Roth's are cash, and the rest would be stocks of MY CHOICE in a private account.  Not a fund that distributes cash funding to companies that I despise.

2281 2018-06-20 04:07:09 Have not used PharmEasy since two consecutive orders were cancelled on the day of delivery stating ‘Out of stock’. Otherwise was fine the first time I tried it. I guess they need to find a way to have retailer stocks reflected on their platform.

2436 2018-06-20 02:29:53 To get new subscribers you have to give them a teaser... a video of one of the stocks or ETFs that you mentioned that you will be talking about will entice and attract new customers ... this is my opinion ... not old videos ....
2437 2018-06-20 02:29:35 You mention that you will be discussing many stocks in your new service ... at least put a video for one of them (current event not outdated) .... you are posting an old video of the SPY from last week ...

Especially stocks which have been beaten black and blue !
2442 2018-06-20 02:26:42 Investors should purchase stocks like they purchase groceries, not like they purchase perfume.

2449 2018-06-20 02:21:11 Stephen I’m in your boat too buddy, onlything that I did was change my style and get off the low float death shit. There is a lot of opinions out there and maybe yours isn’t penny stocks. Two years of wisdom is no bull shit. TRY A DIFFERENT MARKET TYPE... I know you’ll do it!
2450 2018-06-20 02:20:49 Only to cover my stocks with Puts if I have a risky catalyst. I'm inching more and more into Options, but I dislike the fact that they are side contracts, and companies owe 0 fiduciary duty to options Traders.
2451 2018-06-20 02:20:37 All these examples is exactly why the CE was placed on $PDXP MM's screw themselves naked shorting and getting burned.  They have their buddies shut the tickers down to keep from losing all their money. So tired of seeing this shit go on. #stocks #market #business

2453 2018-06-20 02:17:31 So much as the common flu is different and our bodies would not be prepared for the different strains or have the vaccine stocks to prevent a outbreak. A flu strain in the USA that a US citizen would normally get over, could very easily kill a South American or vice versa.
2454 2018-06-20 02:17:21 The technology will make a lot of processes better over time. The ‘currencies’ will soon settle into their rightful place next to dot com era stocks in my view.
2455 2018-06-20 02:16:52 It is sureal, this is sports not politics. Jamaica is not in the competition, the whole country cheers for their rivals Brazil. Just a few illiterate and  semiliterate people are humiliating the intelligent people of the USA, and making them laughing stocks. No disrespect.
2456 2018-06-20 02:15:55 Without exaggeration - Starc, Cummins and Hazlewood probably make up 3 of the best 5 fast bowlers in the world. Not surprised our bowling stocks look pretty thin without them. Throw them back in and it’s a completely different story.
2457 2018-06-20 02:14:07 There's no turning back. I just bought the pricey BTS MEMORIES OF 2017  I dunno tho if I really got it since the numbers of stocks in CNA decreased so fast. Like below 10 available slots.
2458 2018-06-20 02:13:11 Thanks guys it’s definitely a great way to spend my mornings before work looking up stocks and seeing posts for inspiration. You guys keep me in it! @completepenny @timothysykes I would like to sign up for your challenge one day.

2463 2018-06-20 02:08:55 The Dow was meant to be "an" indicator of how a select list of stocks is doing, not "the" indicator of the overall market.  If you want to track the Dow, simply buy one share of each of its 30 stocks.

But researching buy opp ATM. Will add crypto as prices fall more & commodities if they bounce off support here
2493 2018-06-20 01:50:33 The underlying trend is simple. The market follows the economy in the long run. With the economy still growing at a healthy pace (e.g. Housing Starts made a new high today), stocks will eventually follow higher.

2538 2018-06-20 01:22:48 I don't think that bump stocks or any automated or semi-automated weapons were what the founding fathers had in mind when saying that citizens should be able to protect themselves.

2563 2018-06-20 01:08:36 Means nothing, really. The economy evolves. I remember when US Steel was removed from the Dow. If I recall correctly, it was replaced by Disney. All these stocks are still traded, but only a select 30 are used to create an index. If this alarms you track the S&P.
2564 2018-06-20 01:07:38 
2565 2018-06-20 01:07:28 The reverse happens with value stocks. The stocks will generally appear to be cheap, but investors will be able to find any number of arguments as to why they are likely to stay cheap. So the story will crowd out the fact of cheapness. -JM

2570 2018-06-20 01:02:19 Why are people making the 'no stocks' a bad thing?? It is really not. Why would SM be putting stocks on their inventories? Do you know that inventories have costs? Why would you be stocking albums and incurring costs when you can ship it to a record store and have money??
2571 2018-06-20 01:01:04 Seems like voting RED has done s whole lot of good for all Americans to me.  Jobs up unemployment down stocks up pay up peace negotiations up.  What’s not to like.   Oh yes.  You lost and you are still crying over the biggest criminal Clinton

2578 2018-06-20 00:57:41 Since we've done away with the stocks, I'm down with public shaming. The pols who are making these decisions live very comfortable lives. They won't even consider changing things until it's personally uncomfortable for them (if they can't be voted out).

1) On Pullbacks of 2-3%, ( Like Today) We Cash “Some” of our Hedge ( Long Dated, Deep in the Money Puts). 
2) Buy “Some” of Premium Stocks or Indexes. 
3) With Larger Pullbacks, we do More of Same.

2646 2018-06-20 00:22:10 This article reveals a profound lack of understanding why stocks go up and down. It isn't until earnings, interest rates and investible funds are impacted that stocks move in a trend other than the one in force. In other words, don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.
