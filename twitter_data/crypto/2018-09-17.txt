It would chase out raccoons (projects and players), enforce liquidity, and allow crypto to return focus to fintech advancement.

73 2018-09-17 23:49:43 Absolutely correct - these are things beyond #Telcoin control, so #Telfam & those following #Tel should be patient & not get irrate stating that because of delay they will sell their tokens etc. By all means sell, but I feel those who do will regret it. #Trust in #Telcoin

109 2018-09-17 23:43:06 I stopped watching this review when you said $SCRL stores information "in the cloud." You obviously have zero comprehension of blockchain technology, the fact you have made it this far in crypto is spectacular. I recommend you do more research on coins before reviewing them.

119 2018-09-17 23:40:10 I'm very hypercritical when it comes to crypto. I prefer to support a project if only the idea is prominent and the team is super experienced. This project seems to be the one to trust into! @LynkedW
120 2018-09-17 23:40:09 There's the rub. I think the notion of 'decentralized enough' should be promoted. Education would also be helpful. So much stoopid here. Ironic since relevant real world examples are everywhere around us. We are going to witness a crypto Jonestown event eventually.
121 2018-09-17 23:40:02 By far Breaker. 

In terms of feature sets, discovery is still the main challenge. As an example, 90%+ of my podcast listening is crypto related. I’ve always had to “search and find” based on a friends recommendation. 

Breaker solves much of this with their activity stream.

131 2018-09-17 23:37:46 Completely agree with this with all crypto excluding $XRP. Every single one basically relies on the star power of one or at most 2 persons.

151 2018-09-17 23:32:49 Yes but last year he shilled his coins so you can buy them.  I think you are naive. I have nothing against suppoman but all the shilling some influencers have did last year have made them very rich and the followers were losing money.

Oui nous sommes encore dans la cage des crypto...
155 2018-09-17 23:32:03 Banks are trying to be the middle-man for people getting into cryptocurrency. They will push people to invest in crypto by investing in their special services - and they’ll charge a nice fee on top of that.

The whole point of crypto is that you don’t need the big banks anymore.
156 2018-09-17 23:31:49 Like I said holochain is the next wave!! People keep saying well the market cap this and the market cap that. Are you kidding nothing matters in crypto. Get in now

158 2018-09-17 23:30:46 That has nothing to do with what i said. lol.. Im comparing the tech and crypto bubbles..  I never said anything about investing at all.
159 2018-09-17 23:30:36 Jk of course the latest crypto Twitter drama is delicious
160 2018-09-17 23:30:35 All of the sudden @Nouriel is a well-recognized economist according to the crypto markets. 
The truth is, he has predicted 13 of the past two recessions.
161 2018-09-17 23:30:06 It'll be in the dictionary next year.
162 2018-09-17 23:30:06 don’t @ me but doing crypto and bitcoins isn’t a real career. Yes maddd money is involved but q aburrimiento

165 2018-09-17 23:29:55 I didn't see this updated from Brad because I don't care. They are deceptive to retail investors. They tried to get listed on coinbase but couldn't even bribe their way on.

180 2018-09-17 23:26:50 I spend more time on my fantasy football team than my crypto portfolio because:

a) I don’t like paying taxes, and tax accounting in crypto after trades makes me sad. No updates.

b) I like my real life friends.

c) I have more conviction in my crypto bets than my WR3.

296 2018-09-17 23:02:26 $BTC dump to bottom. Looks good to open long position on #Bitcoin 

$6200-$6250 is good support
#BTC is moving sideways the daily need to be close above $6250 for  upwards  
S= $6150-$6250 R= 6350 - $6400

Open long at support with 10-15x leverage and sell resistance

316 2018-09-17 22:58:22 PSA- trading crypto may not be for you. Its not really for me. Maybe try looking at a few coins with high scalability and HODL some for the long run. You don’t have to do what everyone else is preaching to be successful.

330 2018-09-17 22:55:23 Fact is that on the worst day of 2018 $BTC was up 100% Year-over-Year. The only “hard truths” are that newbies who joined late last year and playing the crypto ponies got rekt but years will bring it all back. Just HODL.

341 2018-09-17 22:53:21 No offense to anyone, but that is an abysmally written article. $TPAY deserves better coverage than that. If the desire for crypto to be taken seriously is ever going to come to be realized we need higher quality journalism.

398 2018-09-17 22:41:57 Random crypto thoughts:

 Monero & Zcash seem to be "really working," i.e. widely accepted & the transactions remain anonymous. Could be undervalued in a sea of overvalued projects.

 As excited as I am for @decentraland, $MANA & land seem insanely overpriced.
399 2018-09-17 22:41:52 Oh, you’re serious. Lol

Toppling banks and paper currency will send shockwaves

Yes you’re part of the revolution, but you’ll need to survive it too
437 2018-09-17 22:32:03 I would love to know how many crypto traders have moved over to forex...
438 2018-09-17 22:32:00 yutucoin going hot; join the process;

439 2018-09-17 22:31:53 No way the bank use it without testing it first.   I’ll post a video from 2 months ago where Garlinghouse said XRP and XRAPID to be used by one bank by end of year.  Either Brad is lying or the CNBC writer is full of shit. Credit to Crypto Tony for video and Bank XRP for tweet.
440 2018-09-17 22:31:51 So banks should be regulated too . They are "the legal fraud" .. stealing poor and making astronomous profits on the back of honest worker. Oh wait a minute .. this is why crypto exist rigth ?

443 2018-09-17 22:31:18 That's why I advocate for financial literacy at a very young age. Poor people, too, can invest in stock market, bitcoin, and also benefit from tax advantaged accounts, Roth, 403b/401k, HSA, small business LLC as an S-corp, etc. The only enemy is time. #crypto #bitcoin #finance
444 2018-09-17 22:31:16 I'm fully aware and confident on your gap theory. Even his analysis predicts we might hit 5000 range.

Are you basing the 5k lows on the gaps alone or is it backed with any other parameter like MA or BB or fibs? 
It's a question for learning  @Bleeding_Crypto
445 2018-09-17 22:31:07 That's a good place for empirical accounts/interviews. I loved Dorian Yates' LR interview because of the ayahuasca story. 

We should all be ashamed of the fear mongering and concern trolling on crypto Twitter. How about post some objectivity, ncbi links to relevant studies?

Let's take the Lightning Network as an example...
544 2018-09-17 22:17:40 Market cap of the whole mining sector now approximately the same as crypto (200$ bn). Probably fair to say that a lot of potential mining market cap now parked in crypto...and Canadian cannabis stocks.

560 2018-09-17 22:14:45 I think a bottom is $3400-3700 range. That’s an 80% correction and I feel a bottom bottom. But that’s if we first go to $5400 range and break it. Now a 86% correction is $2500 range BTC price
561 2018-09-17 22:14:36 But he’s not a white guy. That’s all that matters. He’s a brown dude slaughtering women of the night and it doesn’t scream out: “White racist man butchering at risk women” or “see, it’s not Mexican immigrants that are the monsters” it says that monsters come in all colors.

563 2018-09-17 22:14:01 People fail to realize what intrinsic value means.  To many people are uneducated in the financial sector. The blockchain is what gives crypto its intrinsic value.  If the blockchain has no real world use then there cannot be a inflation of value of the coin.
564 2018-09-17 22:13:34 Not saying we won’t see $20k again, but despite the enormous drawdown, the vast majority of crypto investors believe $20k is a certainty. My point is that once current crypto bulls start fearing that ATHs are no longer achievable is when the bottom is likely in.

569 2018-09-17 22:12:17 If you want to understand the real value of crypto, you have to look beyond just payment processing. You need to understand why Cryptocurrencies are MUCH MORE Than ‘Currency’. People have gotten into the habit of using the word “currency” for all cryptos. But what the

The Crypto market gave us a do-over. 

I'm not sure how many more dumps we have to these levels. Probably see another higher low here, then off to the races.

571 2018-09-17 22:12:00 I really believe that XRP will grow naturally as the top crypto asset available, because Ripple and the XRP community are making a great backstage work.

They don’t want to do any work.

670 2018-09-17 21:57:45 what upsets me the most is that so many people follows them & then they go all in on their bullish tweets there are no where to be found when the market drops even further. How do you face your followers? and the sheep continue to follow!! thats even worse! Thats Stupidity IMO
671 2018-09-17 21:57:23 Problem with Twitter is that it's really hard to have an in-depth discussion to really flesh out & debate finer points. Hope to do that face to face one day. In the meantime the world keeps changing & disruptors like EV's and Crypto will bring opportunities & challenges alike.

693 2018-09-17 21:54:21 I have never used the words “took a dump” in my life until crypto
694 2018-09-17 21:54:19 That's how its supposed to work.
695 2018-09-17 21:54:07 @Bleeding_Crypto - I am closely following ur gap charts for alts; those are fantastic. Had a quick question- is it possible for alts to slide more even after they fill all gaps on ur charts?
696 2018-09-17 21:54:07 Crypto-influencers use sarcasm as an excuse when called out on blatant shills...

 "Jesus, can't you tell I was being sarcastic"

No you weren't, you were pumping a bag you just bought.

Stop abusing your position. Stop being thieving greedy bastards.

The social media platform that can be integrated into your favorite social medias allowing users to control their time, let's day you want to post in a specific day for a specific event or a photo, you can do so with this platform.
800 2018-09-17 21:37:58 Crypto gave rise to debates about financial freedom, not possible before. Going by ongoing progress it has been crushed & reduced to status of a 'technology'. Discussions that started from a 'revolution' are now about pros/cons of tech. Not sure, will reach the status you propose

A whole new social media to come and bring every user an innovative socialization platform that lets them control their time and make socializing and posting better with timeline exemptions.
812 2018-09-17 21:36:45 Who in their right mind would buy a derivative while the principal it's based on it's in freefall ? The price must go up in order to bring more suckers to the market :).
813 2018-09-17 21:36:40 Reiterating my stance on crypto market: bear hasn’t finished his job, new lows forthcoming. CT sentiment still too bullish w/ majority expecting BTC and ETH to break ATHs within next 12-15 months. Consensus needs to be that $20k BTC and $1.4k ETH will never happen again.
814 2018-09-17 21:36:32 I review many #crypto projects. It's now the 3rd time I have to say:  Qiex has failed to communicate and maintain following coin listings. This is simply unacceptable of any crypto exchange. My emphatic warning : Do not send crypto to this exchange and do not list  with them !

825 2018-09-17 21:33:55 dudo que baje de precio  la 1080 , ahorita la 1080 y la 1070 estan carisimas por el hecho de que los mineros de crypto estan como enfermos adquiriendo todas esas , dudo que bajen de precio en un buen rato, asi que te recomiendo la 1080 si la encuentras a un buen deal.

833 2018-09-17 21:32:33 Many “store-of-values” have died over the years as the market realized they were not hard money. maximalist fail to be open minded about bitcoin potentially not being the hardest money/crypto. It’s too early to announce a winner, especially when your “winner” lacks fungibility.

847 2018-09-17 21:30:40 @LandM_Marius HODLing crypto turns out to be much more "character-building" than I expected!! But I am still HODLing, Marius! Your positivity helps a lot. Hoping for a nice upturn in prices soon.
848 2018-09-17 21:30:23 Honestly who cares if it goes to 5k. That’s only a small downside for someone investing now. There is way more upside here for a long term investor
849 2018-09-17 21:30:20 The Crypto Rapture.
850 2018-09-17 21:30:15 that's true and a lot of them might not even give people the option to withdraw their Crypto

and its sad that people think of this a good service as it prevents them from handling and storing the crypto (ironically which was the whole point of crypto, to be your own bank)
851 2018-09-17 21:30:07 Could be busy right now!
852 2018-09-17 21:30:04 So if we see the case of the RSI dropping further and taking out the previous low so that there's no longer divergence you'll take the L?
853 2018-09-17 21:29:56 Payment platforms like @stripe are the very reason why crypto will succeed. Centralized payment systems with 3% fees don't work when you take 3 weeks to process payment and your customer service doesn't respond.  @collision @patrickc

965 2018-09-17 21:16:09 Excellent question. Been wondering that myself.
966 2018-09-17 21:16:08 is this applicable to OP or Sherlock
967 2018-09-17 21:16:05 そしてこっちがイーサリアムだ。色々と融通が効くので大切に使っていきたい通貨だな。このお金は燃やすことによって様々な契約を行える。この時間になったら送金できるようにするとか、他の通貨での支払いをトンネルするみたいなこともできるぞ。ビットコインについで人気が高い、良い通貨だ。
968 2018-09-17 21:15:56 Nowhere near the bottom. Been calling $2,500-$3,200 as that window since last December. Run and tell dat.

- Some crypto funds with subpar performance out there
- Some existing funds have very pro-GP terms in their docs re: payout, upsetting LPs
- Lot of mismanagement wrt portfolio strategy and basic stuff like reserves
975 2018-09-17 21:15:26 FUD? I hold XRP since begin Januari 2017 my friend! I am realistic after 21 months holding. Better to stay with both feet on the ground and set your goals lower, then crypto will surprise you.

While some don't like this, it is a great step forward, as it legitimizes the industry.

997 2018-09-17 21:12:00 Scale back and you will see the same increase like btc... btc was under a $ at one point! But you know what, I don't care, I'm no maximalist fan of any crypto out there. I'm interested in tech as a developer. Why do you care so much about what other cypto people follow?
998 2018-09-17 21:11:53 I think that in this scenario all is possible.  But the technology behind #cryptocurrency it’s too big. I’m sure that in the future the Crypto price will grow. #revolution
999 2018-09-17 21:11:50 correct sir. hence the whole scarcity conspiracy gets debunked and you dont have any more parabolic exponential moves in price moving forward. 20k was the all time high for bitcoin. doubt it ever gets close to that now that wall street is financializing crypto

1102 2018-09-17 20:57:17 Some of the more prolific crypto influencers had ridiculous numbers and must be tweeting and replying most waking hours.
1103 2018-09-17 20:57:15 “Holding 10,000 tokens just feels a lot better than 0.06 of a coin, and therefore we’ve compiled a list of cryptocurrencies” LOL

1105 2018-09-17 20:56:53 I really do appreciate your free content Francis.   Your analysis and understanding of the charts along with your explanations of the market trends is probably the BEST that I have seen from anyone in the crypto market.  Btw great call on your last video mentioning the btc spill!

1128 2018-09-17 20:52:23 1) A crypto network is more like a city than a company or an individual. Like a city, a crypto network is a community of people who agree on the location of their residence and work (city) and the protocol that they utilize (crypto network) to run the city.
1129 2018-09-17 20:52:20 The federal reserve note is unconstitutional. The Treasury is tasked providing and deeming the value of minted gold and silver. According to the Constitution, we should be on a bi-metal standard.  All of their reasons for criticizing crypto also apply to the FRN. Hypocrites.

1140 2018-09-17 20:51:00 It feels like crypto is moving into the Post ICO area. In a few months a lot of big boys will join us on the playground.

1196 2018-09-17 20:41:52 If it's open-source, this shouldn't be an issue. I'd be much more concerned about a government move to control the internet than "Bitcoin." Who cares if they try to stop BTC? You can copy and paste and restart - as LTC showed.

1205 2018-09-17 20:40:43 Alternate viewpoint: dumping all your crypto before you lose another 20% in one day isn't capitulation, it's smart financial wisdom.
1206 2018-09-17 20:40:43 Do you think it is unlikely a state will attack bitcoin users in the next 3 decades (assuming mass adoption). You might not die for Bitcoin, but rather die for the feasibility of Bitcoin.

1229 2018-09-17 20:37:21 if crypto were akin to furbies, tamagotchis or some other technocrap, then this might be true
1230 2018-09-17 20:37:07 Lol) Never listen to nobody. My AVG cost is sub 7 so I can afford to hold. If you entered higher, you should cut off your loss at 2% max and look for re-entry. The problem right now is a new lap of trading war with China since this morning. Nothing you can do with that.

1239 2018-09-17 20:35:59 @cz_binance Wouldn't it be ironic if those that had their wealth tied so tightly to crypto that they used tether to prop up the market saw their net worth drop to nothing.

1241 2018-09-17 20:35:06 Hmm. But saying “I would die for my bitcoins” and “I would die for Bitcoin” are two different statements. Bitcoin embodies a morality that some might think is worth dying for.
1242 2018-09-17 20:34:56 Crypto is a bubble and a waste of time dude.

1244 2018-09-17 20:34:20 why do you even have crypto in your name. your clearly just searching for attention you lack in real life.
1245 2018-09-17 20:34:19 Your key, your Bitcoins. Not your key, not your Bitcoins.
1246 2018-09-17 20:34:18 So... $APPC was getting ready these last few days, now at 25% , it is the coin of the @Aptoide app store for android. You can browse the store and some apps allow you to receive $APPC directly in your wallet.

1250 2018-09-17 20:33:42 Saying, "I would die for freedom," or, "I would die for my principles," or, "I would die for free speech and open-source information," is actually much different than saying, "I would die for Bitcoin."

1291 2018-09-17 20:28:31 One way to think about it is that crypto may make practical a kind of "artisanal finance" think craft breweries, that might not eliminate or replace, but could contest and offer a meaningful alternative to, the AmBevs of Wall Street.
1292 2018-09-17 20:28:19 And Ryan is crypto-fash who wielded actual power to set an abominable legislative agenda for years.

1324 2018-09-17 20:23:39 You are right, the development of crypto exchanges is hampered by the problem of liquidity.

1367 2018-09-17 20:16:41 Did you know collapse of Lehman Brothers exactly 10 years ago is what inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin #btc #crypto #technology #blockchain
1368 2018-09-17 20:16:40 If you look at it from a TA point of view not really, way too many strong resistance levels on the way up and far too little buying power to push through. Even if it would hit 1$ imagine the crazy sell off from buyers at current levels taking fropits at 5x. Driving it back down.
1369 2018-09-17 20:16:30 Cahil diyen arkadaş en son fideli mahkemeye verecekti, ben engelli olduğum için soramıyorum. Sonucu ne oldu mahkemenin acaba. İlkokul çocuğu alınganlığı ile mahkemede görüşeceğiz diyordu en son.
1370 2018-09-17 20:16:25 Crypto Evangelist who spout dreams of a utopian society that uses #CryptoCurrency bought $BTC when it was 90% cheaper than today. They all made their money before this last crash. There is no future where everyone is equally rich and equally happy. Someone always has to lose.
1371 2018-09-17 20:16:15 Never listen to a Crypto person
1372 2018-09-17 20:16:09 Kimseyi engellemiyordun hani sen Necro :)) bu girdap seni de içine çekmeye başladı :)
1373 2018-09-17 20:15:45 There is sime FUD with thether going on atm. Havent posted any transactions in 8 hours some believe its a ddos on the network but if you have funds in it might want to switch to true usd or move ither crypto as market is starting to react just a heads up. Not finacial advice.
1374 2018-09-17 20:15:03 Another day, another absolutely top Crypto academic & legend that I learn is leaving for Europe, due to Brexit. Such a loss of talent, nurtured here for so many years. And traffic is heavier at lower levels. Also, most of the top academics leaving are British. It's all very sad.
1375 2018-09-17 20:14:56 na kannst du auch belegen, warum ich angeblich ein "alt right" ler bin oder machst du das nur daran fest, dass ich crypto trader bin? also wenn es nur wegen crypto ist, machst du dir es wieder zu einfach.
1376 2018-09-17 20:14:45 Risk to #crypto and #ethereum is reliance on SEC officials' statements which later can be revoked. Legally permissible yet inherently deceptive. Undermines credibility and moral authority. Bad!
1377 2018-09-17 20:14:44 10k?? You are kidding right? The Crypto is going backwards & has done ZERO since Feb this year when the price was 9000
1378 2018-09-17 20:14:34 At 3560 sats, you think the monster can pull through? :0
1379 2018-09-17 20:14:32 Really getting sick of the line drawers saying they can predict the future, this is all bullshit. Soon crypto coins will be worth less then shit. Again a big ethereum scam pump and dump today #ethereum #eth #crypto #cryptocurrency

1392 2018-09-17 20:11:32 Crypto_Horseman Angelo00084000 I'm tired of morons without basic logic.

If something goes up after it went down, that's called a reversal.

1401 2018-09-17 20:10:36 Yes. Is a very very different way of using xrp. The way that xrapid works utilizes all the pros of xrp while removing the cons of crypto. In a way it's cracked the crypto code.

1447 2018-09-17 20:02:29 As you said when you bought in, XTZ hasn’t seen a bull market. So there still is a chance. Or they could have a killer DAPP but let’s not get crazy.
1448 2018-09-17 20:02:03 I know no place is perfect but, in Germany Nazi memorabilia/artifacts are illegal. The nation addressed WWII their actions as a country & the deaths of millions of Jews.

1470 2018-09-17 20:00:02 no you're not right. if institutions wants to be involved on BAKKT then they will have to accept fractional reserve,commingling, rehypothecation, etc. there's no other option for them. they can't custody the bitcoin themselves. so its fractional or they can be nocoiners

1483 2018-09-17 19:57:51 Some time I wonder
Are you investor or crypto media reporter.
You should never influence on price being reporter.
That's not journalism it's called shilling
1484 2018-09-17 19:57:50 Whoever allows banks to do the custody for their #crypto assets didn’t understand what crypto is and what it stands for. Don’t let history repeat itself!
1485 2018-09-17 19:57:32 You should try to go pet a grizzly, since they are defenseless and all.
1486 2018-09-17 19:57:26 Can meet people in public places but don't be jumping in strangers cars lol
1487 2018-09-17 19:57:24 Fear seeks shelter in nationalism and power. Very good to see a good crypto analyst who can see reality and isn't caught in That story 
1488 2018-09-17 19:57:22 Also when it moons like this, a lot of people don't just dump it or take profits due to their staking it.  You could say its usefulness outweighs its pump and dump utility.  Very smart!
1489 2018-09-17 19:57:17 Having stuff, is not TRUE WEALTH Realize It's about freedom! 

If you are currently a slave to debt U are NOT FREE! 

Freedom is about helping those around you!

Freedom is about enjoying life with LESS THINGS!

1495 2018-09-17 19:56:13 Blockchain Good, Crypto Bad narrative is fading as regulators are increasingly taking the whole space in one conjunction. You can't have runways built without airplanes. Thankfully policymakers are recognizing there is a strong benefit that digital (crypto) assets bring.

1504 2018-09-17 19:55:02 どうでしょうね。
1505 2018-09-17 19:54:57 People are wising up to fractional gold, BTC, whatever. Unless institutions buy fractional BTC just for bragging rights, no one with half a brain will buy fractional BTC which can’t be seen on chain and verified. Am I right?
1506 2018-09-17 19:54:55 Sssssokay... Me too ;)
1507 2018-09-17 19:54:50 Respect mate but I’ve heard that so many times
1508 2018-09-17 19:54:36 Considering the mostly positive correlation between btc, and considering using btc as proxy for most directional calls in the market I would say TA on the alt wasn't as important as TA on btc and finding an alt that historically swung harder on btc could have been done.
1509 2018-09-17 19:54:33 Music is more available to global users than ever before but the disconnect between music creators, collaborators and shareholders is growing, making it more challenging.

1531 2018-09-17 19:48:07 So you're not carrying a ledger with all your crypto on it on a necklace you are wearing, with the PIN written on a piece of paper in your pocket? Good move. That would be a bad opsec!
1532 2018-09-17 19:48:06 Just made a lunch bet with a crypto non believer that BTC will hit 10k EOY.  That got me thinking about poor ole @officialmcafee ....was it 100k or 50k BTC was supposed to reach or he was gonna eat his own d!@k? Looking like he might want to start setting the silverware out

1547 2018-09-17 19:44:57 Jordan B. Peterson is a misogynistic, white nationalist, crypto-fascist who denies climate change exists and says trans activists use the same philosophy as Mao.  He believes Nazism was based on atheism.
1548 2018-09-17 19:44:44 @CNBC "But those partnerships have so far either been unrelated to XRP or are strictly xRapid trial runs. Not a single bank has begun testing the cryptocurrency product yet." This makes no sense. Xrapid trial run means they are testing the crypto product!
1549 2018-09-17 19:44:38 Your deal with PSG concerns a crypto-token that gives fans voting power. Are you not aware that Dan Larimer of EOS owns the patent for voting within a crypto-token environment? Maybe you should advise PSG of this.

1553 2018-09-17 19:44:17 Exactly. So why focus on alt/btc in that case? Look at BTC, and if it’s bearish short the riskiest alt? In my example a lower risk alt was shorted, which was an opportunity cost
1554 2018-09-17 19:44:16 No security tokens are really trading yet at all, and I don't think it will be a highly liquid market. It should be positioned as "optional liquidity", not highly liquid. If you want to dump your tokens, great, but don't expect BTC/public market like liquidity

1568 2018-09-17 19:42:31 I think anything to do with crypto will need to be greatly modified once crypto finds its place in this world. I personally don’t think it will ever be widely accepted by anyone, anywhere.

1570 2018-09-17 19:41:59 This is 100% true in down markets. In predicting loss you are much better simply trading off BTC. Everything will dump if BTC dumps. Upside isn’t as correlated though. And not all dumps will be of equal magnitude

1572 2018-09-17 19:41:47 The trader took a setup which, as far as the facts suggest, was predicated on technicals & it played out

I don't think discussing 1) what caused the price shift 2) how the price shift compared to other instruments, is all too relevant if we're discussing that single trade
1573 2018-09-17 19:41:44 Deep State= their own rules the equivalent of which are “policies” more aligned with a Constitutional Monarchy than Constitutional Republic in which they allege to serve.

1611 2018-09-17 19:36:43 @carterthomas Hey Carter, I have been in crypto for over 3 years, and made good money. Now I have more time and looking to trade more frequent. As a beginner in trading I feel lost trying to make a good strategy. Where do you recommend I get started? Appreciate the help.
1612 2018-09-17 19:36:39 Parce que. Dire ça, c'est dire qu'il n'a profité d'aucun mouvement depuis 9 mois alors faut en laisser passer un peu. C'est aussi facile que de dire que le $BTC va monter à 10k.
1613 2018-09-17 19:36:33 I heard that banks have no money to build their own blockchain and they are really keen on using another public chain that they have no control over and is traded on open markets because price volatility is their favourite...
1614 2018-09-17 19:36:31 True yet not necessarily. In some cases yes. Could find plenty counterexamples. Did consider that scenario before saying #3.

1619 2018-09-17 19:35:42 My only concern is the tax implications of collecting a hundred different coins. If they auto converted to a single btc payout I'd be more inclined to own it.

1637 2018-09-17 19:32:29 But the bat/usd market gives a big shit about the bitcoin/usd market.

If the bitcoin/usd market looks bearish, then the bat/usd market will also look bearish.

Alts have more "fluff" than $BTC. When $BTC is bearish $ALTS are more bearish.
The TA bearish on $ALT / $BTC was right.

1652 2018-09-17 19:29:30 It’s a matter of false attribution. In such a case you could have a bullish TA alt set up, bearish TA set up, or anywhere in between. They’d all dump. In fact, the bearish TA set up dumped LESS than the average set up

1658 2018-09-17 19:28:54 The bitcoin/usd market could not care less about the bat/usd market. If $btc pukes all alt/btc pairs puke harder.
1659 2018-09-17 19:28:53 Reason why DApps struggles with low DAU- Trust is not a necessity, it’s a vanity.

1754 2018-09-17 19:12:25 During 9/11 military bases & certain areas of CT were protected by Humvees w/MK-19 grenade launchers or .50cal machine guns. People said it made them feel safe. I said it looks like an occupation, like a job I used to do. Civilians don't get it they think militarization is cool.
1755 2018-09-17 19:12:20 crypto is less than a decade old, less than the “market cap” of a single large firm. there has been lots of ugliness and scamminess, but we didn’t give up on stock markets because (as @dsquareddigest reports) one in five of early issuers were frauds. i don’t think crypto will

1763 2018-09-17 19:10:13 Crypto is up from this time last year. But like every other segment, gold, stocks and real estate they are all in a bear market at different levels. I don't think it will change into a bull market until around November? IMO not investment advice. Your take?
1764 2018-09-17 19:10:09 They will need to compete again in a free market, and against an anarchy of internet crypto currencies and ICO tokens used as medium of exchange. Interesting times :)

1767 2018-09-17 19:09:56 I'm sure there will be no decisive take by SC tomw, and infact there can't even be any regulation on crypto at such stage when crypto themselves has to prove a lot .
I'm full time working on crypto btw.

1774 2018-09-17 19:09:14 I started a programming project, and since I started it yesterday the total crypto market cap went down $8,000,000,000. 8 billion. In 36 hours.

1778 2018-09-17 19:08:42 All I know is student debt is choking me. That’s why millennials are desperate to pay back debt by investing in crypto. And most of us lose $ in it. In American “free markets” winners win and losers lose

1782 2018-09-17 19:07:55 I love how crypto noobs assume “diversifying” in shitcoins is diversification. They’ve clearly never seen a bear market before 

Ran is also the type who probably neglected Bitcoin because of “slow governance” and low TPS
1783 2018-09-17 19:07:54 When I was in the military we were prohibited from displaying flags in our barracks rooms other than the american flag, also no pictures were to be displayed with any type of hand gestures including two finger "peace" . We all hated it, but now I can see why it was done.

1803 2018-09-17 19:04:00 I think the nay sayers are not considering the short supply of XRP that are not in a wallet and wall street with Bakkt and Nasdaq coming in November, timed with a stock market crash and all that money that will be headed for the crypto market. It is very much possible.
1804 2018-09-17 19:03:59 Cryptos would be seen as a safe haven like Gold. Totally uncorrelated that's why every portfolio should and will have % Crypto basket. Gold did do a spike low before the massive bull run in 08'. The markets were in such panic then. Next time will be similar.

1823 2018-09-17 19:01:46 There is a difference between a poorly designed #dApp/smart contract being exploited and a #crypto network being compromised. "Hacked" is thrown about without context when a dApp/smart contract is unsafe and the cryptocurrency gets blamed. This is like blaming Apple for bad apps.

1839 2018-09-17 18:59:33 not that it matters. Assets can drop below mining costs ALL THE TIME.

With gold, miners just stop mining and start buying.

With crypto, miners can shut down and difficulty can drop.

If you see green figures don't be afraid to take some profit we're not reaching new ATH's just yet.
1876 2018-09-17 18:53:40 Based on all these responses, that as a community we can agree to disagree. Although getting agreement to do that would probably be a headache.

Also, that there is no definitive right answer to what the future of crypto holds. It is too soon to tell. But crypto isn’t going away.

1879 2018-09-17 18:53:18 over. The most disheartening aspect of crypto is when its ambitious strivers try to reproduce “respectable” finance: lool, we can do consumer loans and derivatives markets too! I wish the existing fucked up world were less available as a model. But the brave new world won’t have

1889 2018-09-17 18:51:25 That is a pedantic answer. Pretty much everything you do in life is therefore a gamble. Technically, yes. Realistically, no. Going to sleep does not make you a gamble. Even though there is a probability that you won’t wake up. Crypto is persieved by many as in the same class

In a way that if there's some kind of black swan event / a fuck-up when placing stop-loss,  worst that can happen is a liquidation for a fix margin?

1982 2018-09-17 18:36:40 Yes. As with all crypto trading platforms on telegram. There is an element of risk associated with them. Do not over expose yourself to them and take out your seed as quick as you can. Then you can play with coin that isn’t yours.

2116 2018-09-17 18:14:00 that a lot of charlatans (crypto and otherwise) get quoted in the media is certainly true. it is also true that prominent figures in crypto are much more willing to call out scammers and charlatans (though if course who is a charlatan is always contested) than their genteel

2161 2018-09-17 18:08:13 Same here. Gonna be pumping my fiat into crypto very soon 
2162 2018-09-17 18:08:03 What about crypto grabbed you?
2163 2018-09-17 18:07:58 Crypto currency is the future
2164 2018-09-17 18:07:55 Do they have an English version?
2165 2018-09-17 18:07:51 Diversifying on crypto does not mean to spread your money into different coins. People Fail to understand that this is NOT diversifying.
2166 2018-09-17 18:07:43 Sure, I ll take it : )
2167 2018-09-17 18:07:41 Yeah, that says crypto currencies, I thought were talking bitcoin here?

2174 2018-09-17 18:06:41 All I want is to buy ETH under $200
2175 2018-09-17 18:06:41 Your right about this and one thing $I do personally is try not to worry about USD price. If your long term bullish on crypto then try and just worry about $BTC and wen it rally’s again your USD values will come with
2176 2018-09-17 18:06:40 About time. This is what I like to see.

2235 2018-09-17 17:59:17 Hmm ,from a technical perspective you are not bringing in any #Crypto, as the wallet does not hold any, but only your private keys, similar to your debit cards,so a person is not breaking the law and legally can overturn any border agent action.. Any legal Tweeters to comments?
2236 2018-09-17 17:59:14 What Difference does that make, they are just being replaced by more tokens, overall token count stays the same and more created every day to pay SR. thats old news.

2247 2018-09-17 17:56:55 You are looking at the whole gain/loss in crypto spending wrong.  Each currency is taxed against other currencies.

The solution you are actually looking for is a country to tokenize their currency against BCH.  In this case, being the national currency, gain/loss doesn't apply.

2252 2018-09-17 17:55:56 this drop was caused by the news of mt. gox only, can you image what will be when people receive their crypto, bought for 10 times less than price now. I would not hope that people will sell their btc on otc market, they was reg on mt gox so they know on exchanges are best prices
2253 2018-09-17 17:55:44 Omg it looks@like its happening again, financial system hates scarce supply, if you cannot pump it and print then they will find a way! Not good for BTC :-/
2254 2018-09-17 17:55:27 if you have a trade idea, stick with it. don’t go on twitter and see all the bullshit. last night people would’ve said hold onto alts and btc was going to break resistance. i thought we wld go down, so i placed my orders and went to bed.

2259 2018-09-17 17:54:52 My comment's weren't an attack on you, just a general statement about crypto as a whole. It's true that ROI is definitely a unique aspect of the Masternode space, but in my view, it isn't really a relevant one from either an investment or tech enthusiast standpoint.

2263 2018-09-17 17:53:57 I see lots of "Dance with the one that brought you" thinking in the crypto space.

If you 500x'd on $XRP, $ETH, or some ICO there is nothing stopping you from reevaluating the space today & moving funds to represent how you feel in 2018.

2275 2018-09-17 17:52:44 2 points. 1) We do analysis on masternode coins. Block reward ROI is a unique characteristic of these types of #crypto, that is why it appears prominently in our analysis. 2) Please look through our feed. We have done tons of other #MNO analysis that look well beyond ROI.

My wife always complained about how bad it feels to kiss me when my beard is longer. I don't believed her. She then stopped shaving her genital area.

I get know, what she wanted to say and shaving my beard now at least once in 2 weeks ^^
2280 2018-09-17 17:51:45 Also keep in mind that crypto is a long term investment. Design your portfolios for the long run( years). You'll have higher chances of success. Stop focusing on the quick money.  
Good luck with your investments 
2281 2018-09-17 17:51:39 Agreed. He’s a horrific representative for the crypto community. A complete con man.
2282 2018-09-17 17:51:37 うんうん、ちゃんとRR考えてて素晴らしい！！！本当に上手くなりましたね…
2283 2018-09-17 17:51:31 Crypto currencies aren't a scam even though they're scammers out there. If you're going to invest in anything please do your own research. Don't let anyone sell you on  dreams.
2284 2018-09-17 17:51:29 All fiat currencies are worthless, crypto is the substitution for all
2285 2018-09-17 17:51:14 Wait..... Crypto currency still exists?
2286 2018-09-17 17:51:09 Same
2287 2018-09-17 17:51:02 Will do man. Honestly I might just post it cause I do want opinions. Also crypto has been a big topic amongst my friends so I’ll probably post about that too.
2288 2018-09-17 17:50:53 何かあったのねw
2289 2018-09-17 17:50:34 You report them on your normal tax return and generally pay them all at once, but some people pay quarterly
2290 2018-09-17 17:50:19 Oh my days what a douche.....
2291 2018-09-17 17:50:17 You’re right but that was 2016 in 2017 Jason McCourty was ranked higher than him according to PFF
2292 2018-09-17 17:49:28 From what I remember there was also some kind of intelligence relationship with Mindgeek. Can't remember which of the alphabet agencies it was.
2293 2018-09-17 17:49:19 Well... they say that the details are in the patents, so if these patents don't exist, then where are the details? I'm not the dumb one here lmao
2294 2018-09-17 17:49:06 Done

2391 2018-09-17 17:37:24 I gauge the relative growth the BTC community over time (since 2013), and at the same watching crypto/blockchain vs. BTC interest to filter the noise. For example, we are down to about 15% of people entering Crypto from peak, but up 50+% from 2 years ago. BTC > tokens again too.

Taking down domestic sellers who accept crypto would be very easy, and any half-competent customs service can significantly increase the risks of ordering anything except small items from abroad, most probably enough so that few people would bother.

2562 2018-09-17 17:16:06 珍しいな。それはPeerCoinだ。どっから拾って来たんだ？それは世界初の「Proof of Stake」で動く通貨だ。ビットコインの採掘電気代がもったいないから、管理者をそのまま「金持ち」に委任したシステムだな。だけどこれには弱点があって、買い占めが起こると価値が下がるんだ。

2579 2018-09-17 17:13:08 Yes and there are deminimis rules for forex, so I would expect a similar law change for crypto

2585 2018-09-17 17:12:27 As I said, perhaps crypto makes better sense where you live.

This is a lesson learned.
2621 2018-09-17 17:06:43 The way they're going to do it if they bother is to a) target exchanges so that it's very hard or impossible to change crypto to real money, b) target all the sellers who accept crypto, c) instruct customs to intercept packages from sellers known or suspected of accepting crypto.
2622 2018-09-17 17:06:37 Moving over from fiat world to crypto world is/was the challenge. But once in crypto it’s not hard to imagine a coin with better money/gold features than bitcoin taking bitcoins liquidity. Porting over to the better crypto is relatively frictionless.

2669 2018-09-17 16:59:28 While I don't care about crypto currency as a whole, I will say this about Bitcoin, no one can take it from me unless I give it to them. That I am certain about.

2671 2018-09-17 16:59:18 Hi loving Twitter
Just wanted to know, how's it going with crypto? Still get annoyed by #Bitcoin tweets 
2672 2018-09-17 16:59:12 I am so late to these battles. After the podcast with @RupayaCoin , I am quite intrigued now.
2673 2018-09-17 16:59:10 Aldım stop oldu
2674 2018-09-17 16:58:59 This is BS, DotCom. There is no protection in crypto. Tangible assets such as gold, silver, real estate, etc. are the only way to protect against market crashes.
2675 2018-09-17 16:58:55 Bu adam bitmexden eos mu longlamış longlatmış yoksa normal bir borsada eos mu aldırmış yoksa herkese long açtırıp marketten eos mu pumplatmaya çalışmış
2676 2018-09-17 16:58:34 I’ve read a lot of TA and speculation that BTC will pump up to around 6800 to 7k, before the next big drop that could be sub 6k. Just curious about your thoughts?

2695 2018-09-17 16:54:51 As the crypto currency folks are currently learning the hard way, fixed-quantity assets cannot maintain a stable price, because demand is volatile. Money-liabilities become stable by elasticity: every second of every day, quantity is adjusting to stabilize price.

2747 2018-09-17 16:47:28 I'd rather not buy used cards, especially coming from a crypto miner. That card is most likely to be ran 24/7 in its state of crypto mining so it doesn't have much mmore life left in it. Maybe go with a new one, becuase it might not be save to risk 200$.
2748 2018-09-17 16:47:02 not even a peak. fatbtc does not have real trades and 100% of its volume for $QNT is fake.

usd seems to be doing a good job in venezuela and other failing states for a black market currency.

problem with crypto in failing states is core competency of those states is surveillance. physical bills seem much more practical.

2800 2018-09-17 16:39:39 Welcome to the future of crypto @JainArgh :-)
2801 2018-09-17 16:39:39 When I got the bill, I saw the total was $80.56, thought I’ll leave $20 and the total will be $100.56. Then I talked & laughed & filled it out without paying close attention. Rather than comment that I’m a generous tipper or still promoting crypto, tell the world I can’t add?
2802 2018-09-17 16:39:39 That sounds bullish.  Also, #crypto pales in comparison to fiat in the funding illegal activities department.
2803 2018-09-17 16:39:18 Overall, the crypto market as a whole looks like it could easily break lower if some serious buying doesn’t start soon.

2814 2018-09-17 16:37:49 that’s amazing - think a lot of people have done badly in crypto of late.
2815 2018-09-17 16:37:39 I believe indeed many people buy or sell only when Twitter experts call. These last 2 days I have seen at least 3 crypto influencer calling long on pumping BCO.They bought it and all sheeps back buying too.When will they learn to not buy/sell on calls but do their own research?
2816 2018-09-17 16:37:38 Not sure Xlm has any ability to reach any target with a so little team. 11 people when you see several hundreds at ripple
2817 2018-09-17 16:37:16 That’s why I switched my HODL strategy into swing trading for short term. As soon as I heard ETFs and getting approvals, I knew that it was going to go up and down based off announcements

2826 2018-09-17 16:36:19 My main concern with #MarijuanaStocks #cannabisstocks was reaffirmed at a #LegalizeMarijuana event I just attended ... people there were talking more about #cryptocurrency than #cannabis. In other words, the space is being taken over by an exodus of #Crypto bros (and bro-ettes).

2851 2018-09-17 16:33:26 Ehhh, different protocol, different variables. My issue is that this is not a selling point for LTC to rest on. Especially since that use case, if that's the play, you could attribute to almost any crypto.
2852 2018-09-17 16:33:19 My boy @CurtxCobain need to talk crypto w me.
2853 2018-09-17 16:33:12 I prefer mitigation blocks in Forex. 

With low market cap markets like crypto wicks aren’t as meaningful. However, if there are there are significant wicks across exchanges on Bitcoin i’ll take note of them. 

Day traders: take note of the last wick around 6632.

2975 2018-09-17 16:17:22 Justement personne ne s'imaginait 9 mois de krach... ou peut-être 2 ans de krach qui sait ? 2019 pourrait être comme 2018 et là on va en perdre beaucoup sur le chemin !

2990 2018-09-17 16:16:12 True and an important often ignored point. For millennials, as it was for me, crypto makes investing easy for the first time. Not dealing with anyone for my finances is not just a matter of trust and fees but also of convenience!
2991 2018-09-17 16:15:56 I remember buying canopy at 6 CAD and selling at 20 because I thought it was too much... told a friend to not buy in because how could it go higher? lol
2992 2018-09-17 16:15:40 And yet, they are the only one delivering something. Crypto project are slower than normal projets, it is a fact.

2999 2018-09-17 16:14:58 Escrow just makes sure they don't dump it on the market in one go, which they wouldn't do anyway if they have half a brain. 

Ripple can exist as a company, but it is not a decentralised peer-to-peer network if you have a "freeze" feature. Selling it as "crypto" is a scam.
3000 2018-09-17 16:14:38 Uhhh no. 

The price of a bitcoin isn’t tied that much to the mining costs. It’s tied to the demand. Adoption is therefor a far bigger factor. More demand is higher price and the demand isn’t tied to mining in any way.
3001 2018-09-17 16:14:34 what #Ichimoku setting do you use? Default - 9-26 -52 - 26 or Crypto adjusted 20-60-120-30 ??

Так или иначе, начавшийся с 17 сентября кошмар, который продолжался вплоть до начала 50-х, был куда страшнее.

3012 2018-09-17 16:12:45 2018 ne pouvait techniquement pas être meilleur que 2018. C'était basé sur l'emotivité de la hausse mais cette hausse était trop manipulé pour tenir. J'aurais cru quand même à autre chose que 9 moia de krach.

3067 2018-09-17 16:07:08 It's called a market cleanse.  I've seen it in other markets as well in the past before crypto.  Its flushing out bad actors, such as manipulators, and garbage coins.  It's also a shake down from large investors to get the little people out to prevent wealth.

3164 2018-09-17 15:55:26 and the problem i find in the analogy is that we tend to group users as this clear distinct groups. i dare say many people in crypto do take-on dual roles. miners + businesses owners who pay salaried workers, miners + buys coffee with bitcoin, trader + dev apps on bitcoin

3170 2018-09-17 15:54:30 W/o medium of exchange it's impossible. Higher and higher fees in BTC? Why wouldn't people use Dash or ETH instead? Both have outperformed BTC performance. W/o merchant adoption there's no utility to BTC. SOV can be any Crypto that's being used.

3176 2018-09-17 15:53:50 I think we can safely assume that the Mt. Gox $BTC won't get dumped immediately. Those who had crypto in 2014 probably have a fair understanding of the market. That same group of people is, however, quite likely to put their $BCH on a firesale immediately.

3196 2018-09-17 15:51:59 If you believe #crypto market will return to its former glory, the benchmark for a 10X gain, is a 90% retracement.  As of today, here are a few of top-25 coins that are at or above a 90% pullback: 
#IOTA = 90%
#NEO = 91%
#XRP = 93%
#ADA = 96%

3197 2018-09-17 15:51:52 Too much industry jargon and technical terms here for the layperson like myself. Can anyone ELI5 this for me and what it means for the public? Especially if it applies to crypto and specifically to Ripple and XRP..

3225 2018-09-17 15:49:45 The #crypto market was the most explosive market ever and I think we are close to the next explosive move upwards in #crypto.

#uranium

3238 2018-09-17 15:47:47 I got bags of @creditscom @ModernChain  and @LinkChainX . They all are projects that are going to encourage non-crypto people to use crypto on a daily basis to better their lives. Invest in projects like that and you will see Suppoman gainz !!!

So imo that is healthy correction.

3258 2018-09-17 15:45:54 Мы этого не знаем. В реальности, именно Западная Беларусь сохранила гораздо больше национальной идентичности, чем восток. Многие народы живут столетиями в составе другого государства (Каталония, например) и не теряют своего лица, поэтому далеко не факт.
3259 2018-09-17 15:45:45 The latest is trend now is the Crypto currency with lots of companies scamming millions from Africans.
3260 2018-09-17 15:45:38 All the people who got wiped out with ICO funding. So many scams where people madr millions. Shocking!!
3261 2018-09-17 15:45:34 If you take first fraction away, since I am referring to Crypto Space, people that are moderate are the ones that believe in Bitcoin, but not exclusively.
3262 2018-09-17 15:45:25 The same ideological justification for supporting any crypto currency.
3263 2018-09-17 15:45:18 The problem is crypto securities dont pay dividends, without dividends the only investment thesis left is pimp it as money (bitcoin 2.0). I take issue all monetary tokens that arnt bitcoin because proliferation of monetary tokens is not compatible with enduring digital scarcity

3284 2018-09-17 15:42:16 In crypto, I'm generally against any measure that is based on volume or trading history because in an anonymous world nothing stops people from wash trading or faking history.

We should look for metrics of health that are based on information like current order book.

3312 2018-09-17 15:39:06 DEX's will become the new standard in due time and when that happens, Government regulation of Crypto will effectively become irrelevant. They can control and threaten centralized exchanges through regs, but they won't be able to touch or influence a DEX in any way.
3313 2018-09-17 15:39:05 Weißt du @Bimon was mich jedes Mal erschreckt? Wie du immer wieder geradezu fanatisch auf dieses Thema reagierst.

But I blame the exchanges and crypto elites for still treating Bitcoin as the nr. 1 crypto when we know that Bitcoin hasnt gotten better in the past 9 years and probably never will.

3351 2018-09-17 15:35:23 From what I read (not much) the issue is all the btc trade volume is on these foreign pseudo exchanges that have no oversight, is the solution for someone like nasdaq to open a crypto exchange and soak up all the volume?
3352 2018-09-17 15:35:15 I see. But does it solve the problem of changing my USD to XRP and then my XRP to USD, coz that is where all the fees are incurred? I send money internationally every month and suffer from fees (fees from 1 buying crypto on coinbase, then fees again when taken out of exhange)

I'm about to leave the crypto space. It's gotten too savage. I can't see many retail traders lasting much longer. I suspect exchanges are influencing the spikes and dumps as well, liquidating margin traders.

3410 2018-09-17 15:28:25 @ProfFaustus was not part of the original BCC community, neither was @rogerkver , neither was I for that matter.  If de facto control of a crypto goes to it's founders, or anyone else, it's fundamentally broken.

3500 2018-09-17 15:18:43 I happen to agree, but CSW has some fantastic ideas and some of the proposals(promises) of @nChainGlobal would be wonderful for the crypto space. I could use both the BSV coin& BCH to further crypto along in very different ways. After crypto is widely accepted.Then winner decided
3501 2018-09-17 15:18:41 Cryptocurrencies can relieve pressure on USD by offering another alternative payment system, at this juncture that appears to be a sensible approach to take. Crypto assets are better than bond notes, ythey can be used across borders and Zimbabwe needs to create and export crypto.

3514 2018-09-17 15:16:59 One reason to think that we haven't hit the crypto bottom yet is that there's still tons of people out there whose reputations deserve to be much more tarnished than they have been so far.

3523 2018-09-17 15:15:57 I would like to thank all miners for securing our Crypto over the past decade. You are not the bad guys, quite the opposite.

3531 2018-09-17 15:14:45 Think rationally. It is just 0.5% of total market cap - and that is a if. Obviously 1Bn if market sold can cause a dip, but its nothing that the market can't absorb. Fud in my eyes.

We could also say that it can cause volatility... Volatility in crypto-market, what a shocker 
3532 2018-09-17 15:14:44 banking sector is bound to doom. the way they operate and encourage corruption, it will die sooner rather than later. I am glad that I am part of crypto evolution
3533 2018-09-17 15:14:44 I stayed on the ride long enough, peaking at 300k TRX, but after listening to all the promises which was nothing but hype, I sold the lot and took a hit financially to buy more XRP as this is solving a real problem and will have more “Real World Use” than any other, Sorry JS.
3534 2018-09-17 15:14:25 Agreed. So, as the VC model even if 1 of his many outlandish promises take off, won't that be good enough ? #Axovant going after Alzheimers was over ambitious (we all know not a single company ever has worked it out). Essentially isn't this true for the VC, Crypto bubbles?

3540 2018-09-17 15:13:41 Some people like volatility, so ETF's can be useful for them. Likewise, institutional investors can create strategies using ETF's v's the actual currencies. Younger generations want to invest in things they understand, like crypto, snapchat, etc.. not Dow 30 cos.

3545 2018-09-17 15:12:53 Why do you think BTC’s correlation with other assets would turn -ve? How did gold do during ‘08 recession?
3546 2018-09-17 15:12:48 I disagree. Private sales are still a struggle. It reminds me of my days of raising from VCs. Helped raise two legit ICOs in this bear market. Most contributors in private sales are crypto-rich, which means the vast of majority are too rekt to invest in anything right now.
3547 2018-09-17 15:12:42 Wrong. Blockstream undermines btc with their second lyer ambitions. Nchain and coingeek insist on locking the protocol and eliminating the block caps. 

I couldnt be happier my favourite crypto has such responsible custodians.

3650 2018-09-17 15:02:39 This is less about bitcoin/crypto and more about the complete lack of financial preparedness/education young people have access to. A $25k loan to put into an investment? That's easily in the top 3 "no-no's" in investing, regardless of the vehicle.

3723 2018-09-17 14:56:39 One of the most important things to do when dealing with $crypto is to always make sure you’re aware and alert. It’s very easy to avoid tricks like fake links and fake giveaways if you’re always on the look out for it. And NEVER give out your private keys.
3724 2018-09-17 14:56:38 here's a take for you:

3725 2018-09-17 14:56:31 I’m totally with you when the hype originates on crypto twitter but when you can literally go to the source and see the ticker listed there I’d think that graduates past “rumor” by even the most conservative of standards. To each their own though!

3734 2018-09-17 14:55:35 Can you elaborate why you think bitcoin becoming a mainstream investable asset results in an differentiation between bitcoin and altcoin? E.g. Don’t you think the sole goal of some of the altcoins is to actually become the new mainstream investable asset?

3836 2018-09-17 14:44:13 I think I'm rightfully sceptical about the underlying motives for these project launches. Incentives are just rather skewed in the crypto space. A couple of hyperbole promises and a credibly looking brain fart is enough to have retail investors throw money at a project.

3912 2018-09-17 14:34:09 Yes, thank you for sharing Luke, especially the new Valentines Day timeline is helpful. Still it really doesn't fit the "a dump is incoming right now" narrative, hence why I made that thread in response to previous, even less accurate reports.

3921 2018-09-17 14:32:54 Correlation of crypto with other asset classes has usually been around zero because crypto has been dominated by retail investors. I expect correlations to become positive with time. Crypto is a speculative asset class that draws on excess liquidity, not a safe haven asset class.

Saying that governments can’t stop it is a very overly simplistic view of the power that government and central banks have over money, banking, & currency.

4182 2018-09-17 13:59:58 I tried to push myself to buy some super cool #stocks. 

It’s pain in the ass... and I thought that crypto is complicated and hard to manage. 

Compared to my overall $crypto experience, $stocks are like sending a letter at the post office.

$STO will be THE HIT

4185 2018-09-17 13:59:27 Crypto ist eben nicht nur BTC. ETH, XLM, EOS sind zB drei große Plattformen für künftige Innovationen (ja, Skalierbarkeit noch unklar, kommt aber). Die Engstirnigkeit und Zukunftsfeindlichkeit „der Deutschen“ erschrickt mich immer wieder aufs Neue.

Ich glaube vom jetzigen Stand nicht, das es so ist. Und das gerade weil ich mich damit beschäftigt hab.
4274 2018-09-17 13:48:21 i know that - but its done in such a way its largely lost all the good shit and is heavily dependent on google. The OS itself is google upgrade dependent in the same way as IOS is Crapple dependent.

4294 2018-09-17 13:45:58 I'm seeing a lot of projects not even make it to public sale and selling out in seed/private or Pre-ICO stage. Due to a variety of reasons, but perhaps primary being regulator scrutiny of public sales.

Plus, a lot more interest from Family Trusts, institutions and other 'whales'

4357 2018-09-17 13:36:18 1) Dear @Twitter , I'm tired of filtering out the fake profiles from threads and blocking them since you don't do anything. I've blocked several Elon musk fake profiles in the last couple of days alone,that were polluting threads with crypto related tweets...

4359 2018-09-17 13:36:12 Give it time, the longer you're in this game you will eventually realize we need to shake those hands to get mainstream adoption. Unfortunately crypto doesn't have the leverage to topple the big banks or gov. We all have to work together to change the system from the inside.
4360 2018-09-17 13:36:08 Perhaps, for now I'm with Loom on this one though.

4367 2018-09-17 13:35:10 不動産は色んなパターンがあるので、一概には言えませんが、一般的に不動産を購入する時は買付と言って購入金額の数%を支払って対象不動産をキープしておくことができます。今回のパターンは契約書を書いてからの手付金支払いなので、後は特約事項にどのように明記しているかで変わってきますが。

4. Making Crypto more Centralised 
5. Showing how #DigitalAssets are the future

Thanks again!
4510 2018-09-17 13:14:28 It's going to take a better solution than what exists today. It's hard for ordinary people to use crypto for ordinary things.

4534 2018-09-17 13:10:51 Wouldn't call those identities, but not sure of a better word. imo there's a difference for identity w/ decision privilege (vote on protocol props), and for identity w/ access privilege (can use crypto ATM). Sybil is less important there and most abuse can be mitigated via fees.

4538 2018-09-17 13:10:16 Up til the around end of 2013, this was a pretty good description.

The fact that it has not been true since then explains most of the misunderstandings people have today about crypto.

4564 2018-09-17 13:06:47 If I had enough and the price was a tad more stable - probably would yes

4567 2018-09-17 13:06:14 I buy high sell low. Icenter have provided me with a consistent accumulation of crypto that I would never have had if left to my own devises. It’s all about risk management. Do not put your life savings in there, be careful and alert. DYOR.

4569 2018-09-17 13:05:50 Oh I agree.  But a blockchain without a crypto currency to make it trustless is just a glorified excell spreadsheet

4572 2018-09-17 13:05:32 in practice, cryptos are pretty interchangeable. both trading markets and user payments use whatever "crypto" is most convenient - mined coins, centralised coins, ICO tokens. bitcoin is still top, but it's a difference of scale, not kind. the market doesn't care about ideology.
4573 2018-09-17 13:05:26 It's official! Bitcoin now processes more transaction value than Visa. With over $2.4 trillion sent and received in 2018, so far. #cryptoking

4584 2018-09-17 13:03:34 BTW the extra funny part here is that many European crypto folks get their legal education from US TV and believe their courts cannot admit some kinds of evidence.

Say, those obtained by unwarranted SIGINT & traffic analysis to determine users of particular crypto accounts.

4595 2018-09-17 13:02:14 1/ Articles are popping up warning about an incoming market dump related to Mt.Gox. People claim that a) the large bitcoin wallet that started moving funds in August is related to Mt.Gox and b) the fact that creditors (private & corporate) can apply for compensation and will dump
4596 2018-09-17 13:02:01 In light of statements from Ripple execs that #XRapid is coming before EOY and maybe "in a month or so", I think we all need to take a moment to exhale. Real crypto utility is unprecedented. If $XRP does not "moon" immediately after launch, it is NOT a failure. Zoom out and #Hodl
4597 2018-09-17 13:01:59 I've been researching this coin for months and my findings are as follows:
1) sophisticated DPoM protocol (Delegated Proof of Moon)
2) Low sat value, which enables new users to experience the true power of the blockchain
3) A bespoke rekt chart launched directly into "despair"

Token price directly depends on the quality of startup portfolio selection. Tokens have to be in service and thus as utility get the value! Tokens with good utilities can rise very fast in price!

4601 2018-09-17 13:01:03 Well @SenorHansel Crypto is full of strategists who think of all the possible vulnerabilities but yes, I’ve heard people raise that as an actual concern. It’s just a dumb one which is why it made my dumb list.
4602 2018-09-17 13:00:50 Crypto is the ultimate game of conviction. Most of the best investment opportunities are non-obvious. They require independent thinking, discipline, and the courage to act alone. Those that do will be rewarded handsomely. -quoted from APompliano

4695 2018-09-17 12:46:29 If #Crypto-related projects manage to find a way to share their companies' #profits with their coin holders and avoid #SEC-s in the process, that would be a serious (maybe impossible) #disruption and a nice way to say "thank you" to those who really made everything happen.

4698 2018-09-17 12:46:08 それはCounterPartyだな。最近だとあんまり見かけない珍しいトークンだが、独自のトークンをビットコインの通貨に乗せて作れる便利なトークンだ。一個試しに作ってみるか？今だとだいたい700円くらいで発行できるぞ。俺も昔20個くらい作って友達に配ってたっけな…もう昔のことだ。
4699 2018-09-17 12:45:58 at the moment, its not so easy to do that for everyone.  Some may be easy  but it takes time and effort and stack of paperwork and KYC/AML and regulatory compliance and record management, a lot of hoops to go if you want to operate a retail store accepting crypto

4735 2018-09-17 12:40:25 Thanks. I lost some files from crypto folder a few weeks ago and your support helped me to recover them, but currently crypto is quite fragile currently. If I delete by mistake files on my side, I can't recover anything.  Annoying since these are the most critical files ...
4736 2018-09-17 12:40:22 Isn't it refreshing that the price doesn't budge with this news?

It indicates that the average Crypto investor needs more than just 'this or that might happen'

Aimless speculative FOMO is more or less dead, which is something I think I like.

4809 2018-09-17 12:28:44 I actually believe the way governments eventually move against cryptocurrencies is some combination of targeting exchange gateways, increasing reporting requirements for firms that accept crypto, and intercepting parcels from offshore retailers that won't comply.

4829 2018-09-17 12:25:04 I'm surprised so many have voted for xrp. Don't you know that it's lost like 90% of it's value since the start of this year? Crazy people. #crypto #Bitcoin

4832 2018-09-17 12:24:46 a flaw in bankrupt system and crypto, they move everything to crypto, declared bankruptcy and then after they reopen no more debts with a new name and new miners and still plenty of valuable coins.
4833 2018-09-17 12:24:40 50 USD a month to mine at #ArgoMining.  Does that mean a return greater than 50 USD? If not, why not just buy the crypto? #crypto #altcoin #mining

4844 2018-09-17 12:23:54 you’ll look back on the infancy of crypto and liken it to the beginning of the internet. many people were nitpicking amazon in the early 90s for instance or were convinced Ebay would be the dominant online retailer. internet retail an example but it’s just way too early imo

5072 2018-09-17 11:45:23 Can you solve this #Crypto riddle? 

Three people check into a hotel.

They pay 0.03 $BTC to the manager and go to their room.

The manager suddenly remembers that the room rate is 0.025 $BTC and gives 0.005 $BTC to the bellboy to return to the people.

5161 2018-09-17 11:30:32 Except that Labour voters and Labour members are against Brexit. 

The myth of left-behind working class voters as the bedrock of Brexit has been quite insidious. It’s pushed by Lexiters and crypto-lexiters, as well as demagogues on the tight.
5162 2018-09-17 11:30:23 There are two types of people in this world:
1. The ones who can't be bothered with and let others managing their money.
2. the ones who take the matter into their own hands and start owning their finances.

The ratio between the two is around 80/20.
Which one are you?

「出来高は価格に先行するパターン」と「価格は出来高に先行するパターン」「なんとも言えない時期」がどういった時に切り替わるかを見つけること。

5232 2018-09-17 11:19:19 You think crypto is having a big impact? Seems like fighting for same audience. Shrinking pool of capital.  Problems with the index shift and money being tied up in passive?
5233 2018-09-17 11:19:19 Quite funny, before crypto I disliked studying economics. 

I'm in crypto for a year now and actually through the charts I'm getting towards theories regarding modern economy & politics and I do understand underlying concepts way better.

Quite a ride so far, to be honest.

5237 2018-09-17 11:18:45 Hmm, that doesn't make sense, they specifically talked about 0.08 per coin. Considering their assets' value, they are not able to refund the entire supply for 0.08, just the 25% from investors it seems. I'm pretty sure I read that other coins would be burned.

5252 2018-09-17 11:16:12 So their creation and use will prove to be a waste as a "crypto" asset.

5330 2018-09-17 11:05:38 The fact that we are at 40% segwit transactions (anyone-can-spend) and not a single satoshi has been stolen, is a testament to the incredible honesty and righteousness of the crypto community.

5332 2018-09-17 11:05:01 Obo görseli var ama aktif olmadan var demek ve ona göre işleme girmek olmaz. Bunun yanı sıra bir formasyonun hedefe varması için etkenleride değerlendirmek lazım. Bu kadar büyük bir zaman diliminde ve ciddi düşüş hedeflerinde çalışması zor. destekleyici fud lazım olabilir.

5336 2018-09-17 11:03:54 Well there we can agree - I just didn't think the question was rhetorical.

But it's the same with all coins where people are invested. That's the issue with crypto. It's the same with most coins. Crypto-traders seem to find it hard to separate themselves from their investment.

5440 2018-09-17 10:50:36 Opinion polls are much more reliable than election polls, no electoral college, & even if you give a huge margin of error, 74% is undeniable.

Unless it's a negative poll of Trump. We both know that all negative news about Trump is fake.

5465 2018-09-17 10:47:12 Most of these companies have no idea how 2 market their products. Many of them don't even have a marketing budget  

The ones that have $ tend to hire these "marketing firms" that aren't related 2 crypto at all and have no clue how to interact with the community or get results

5472 2018-09-17 10:45:48 There is in WXY (white colored), with the X higher as the top (228$ )of white W (where it corrected from 224$)... is that allowed in WXY? Also the white Y is normally 1.618 extention from the previous move, so it would be at 194$ instead of your 198$. Correct me if I am wrong.

5519 2018-09-17 10:37:22 It’s a shame because BitShares has so much potential for diversification of portfolios while still staying in crypto and SteemIt could give Facebook a run for it’s money with a few tweaks. I’ve been hoping EOS will be the glue to bring it all together.
5520 2018-09-17 10:37:15 Also the HFT that gets the order flow almost certainly has better execution capabilities than robinhood itself routing to individual exchanges. Would probably be worse spreads for RH to implement themselves, pipes already set up for the HFT

Whereas a trust-less, open sourced, redundantly verifiable, encrypted form or relating, without a centralizing authority - takes to long to say.

5594 2018-09-17 10:23:41 It is a shame how many of our leading institutions get coopted into being glorified marketing materials for corporates. Not specific to crypto, but I would hazard a guess it is even more effective in this space given general lack of understanding inc from other sectors (eg media)

5760 2018-09-17 09:58:31 Crypto has an objective. To transfer wealth from the fomoers to the scammers.

Bitcoin on the other hand seems to be headed toward becoming perfect money. That seems to be its objective.

2. With the copy feature on 1BROKER you can close the copied trade whenever you feel like it. This at least hands some control over to the copier.

5823 2018-09-17 09:48:14 How can you say that? The institutional way doesn't put crypto in the hands of anyone but institutions. They, in turn will probably do with as they have done before with any traditional financial instrument they took possession on.

6002 2018-09-17 09:14:20 Most of the best people in crypto don't go to events. Which I guess sucks as personality event exposure level. But sadly right now, new people either encounter flashy hype gloating traders or people who are depressed/got rekt, & lost faith in BTC.

Neither of these 2 personas gud
6003 2018-09-17 09:14:19 豆知識12：仮想通貨の中国語名は、英語名と似た発音を持つ漢字を当ててつけることが多いですが、NEM（新经币）はその意味からつけられた数少ない名称で、New Economy Movement（＝新経済）の略であることから新经币と名付けられました。

When it's comes to scaling, theoretically it would be more realistic for Ethereum to migrate to it's own shard on rchain (Vlad zamfir just asked his followers about the possibility of a crypto merger:) then to create scalable infastr. itself
6016 2018-09-17 09:12:37 トレードにおけるメンタルを鍛えるとは、含み損を我慢すること？
いや違う。
含み損を我慢しなくてもいいような自分なりの仕組みを構築するしんどさに耐える精神力を鍛えるということ。
目的を達成するために必要なメンタルの意味を履き違えないようにせねば。

6082 2018-09-17 08:59:15 At the moment, the next court proceeding for Mt. Gox is not scheduled until September the 18th, 2018. Before that date, Mr Kobayashi would not be able to sell the remaining Bitcoins. That may lead to a reduction of volatility in the markets, at least until September.
6083 2018-09-17 08:58:53 Cashing out without KYC will become impossible, unless you sell P2P. That's why we need full-blown crypto adoption. Even crypto-to-crypto conversion is becoming heavily KYCed (Shapeshift), cause govts are afraid of privacy coins, but good & truly decentralized DEX will solve this

6114 2018-09-17 08:53:58 Yup. Are you familiar with the idea of marginal emission factors? Increasing inflexible demand in an electricity grid increases the use of the marginal power source, which almost invariably is coal or gas. So even if crypto mines buy power from hydro, emissions increase a lot.

6148 2018-09-17 08:47:08 Actually those FACTs are pretty hard to verify, hydro plants are a limited resource, and there are reasons why actual energy researchers don't treat energy systems in such simplistic manner. 

If crypto uses up hydro electricity, the same hydro cannot be used to displace coal.

I have spoken about this about 100x times. Every smart contract platform will have dapps get hacked, regardless of the language/blockchain/consensus algorithm they use. EOS is trash, but not bc a dapp got hacked.

6256 2018-09-17 08:24:47 For POS verifone is the number 1 in the market for now and i heard toast is leaning towards that
And i know GRAFT is so the merchants accept crypto card and they can opt whether to accept the payment in crypto and fiat
I probably wrong because i read those quite some time ago

6270 2018-09-17 08:23:14 I don’t have an issue with networking events or ‘crypto’ meet ups: great idea.

Events like this though are just shilling events masquerading as educational conferences.

The only ones to benefit are the organisers and coin/token owners whose money is taken from attendees.

6305 2018-09-17 08:16:07 Thank you! The interviews happened when we were already in a bear market, and it had not diminished their view of the possibilities :) Some people would argue that volatility of crypto vs fiat makes it risky, but yes, if you hold your private key, you get to keep your assets!
6306 2018-09-17 08:16:06 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。

6406 2018-09-17 07:58:25 Snapchat couldn't be conceived/built in 1995. Crypto ecosystem is too nascent, will mature with time (and would support almost all real world use cases). Besides, lightning network is already taking us forward.
6407 2018-09-17 07:58:20 Furthermore the exchange rate from crypto to fiat via the wirex wallet is significant lower then current rate on any known exchange (e.g. coinbase). So, what are your benefits then?

6410 2018-09-17 07:57:43 In dem Fall ist das keine "Kinderkrankheit". Telegram macht per Default keine Ende-zu-Ende-Crypto und entschlüsselt auf deren Server. Das bringt den Vorteil, dass man zwischen Geräten wechseln kann. Für Ende-zu-Ende gibt's dann "private" Chats. Das ist bequem, aber eben unsicher.

Don't take  blinded risks-but calculated. Crypto is still alive.
However, if u have not sold you have the possibility of a bounce back. Stock market plummeted in 2008 and is now on record high today.

6434 2018-09-17 07:52:22 With this card you can NOT spend crypto. You spend fiat! This is completely different to @tenxwallet
! What you are doing on wirex: you just fill up your wallet with crypto and then have to exchange it to fiat to make it spendable with wirex card.

6445 2018-09-17 07:49:18 No one is forced to use our private crypto-money.  Our crypto-money is not on any public exchange and never will be, which gives us the full rights to self-regulation.

6552 2018-09-17 07:28:14 While not giving any proof, other sources expect a payout in late 2019. Given how slowly the procedures in Japan unfolded so far, that's at least way more likely, than a "market crash" at the end of the registration deadline like the article suggests.

6600 2018-09-17 07:19:58 Yes, but a quick deep dump makes for a better recovery as opposed to a slow bleed.
So therefore 6750 is bullish because it will help fuel the sharp dump (low 5s) and quick recovery thereafter, wiping out a tonne of plebs on Mex along the way.

6721 2018-09-17 07:01:38 hint: least important part of starting a successful business is the original idea...execution and intuition is everything
6722 2018-09-17 07:01:38 9/ additionally the #ethereum base layer is less secure than #bitcoins, no one in either camp would argue that...so maybe solidity contracts will also use staychain translations as insurance policy back to #bitcoin just Incase ethereum fails as base currency?! 
6723 2018-09-17 07:01:37 8/ this will enable the base money chain (bitcoin) to continue to grow linearly, while the 2nd utility layer can grow exponentially in size & creativity

This is superior to the #ethereum model where the base chain & 2nd layer are grouped & growing at same exponential rate
6724 2018-09-17 07:01:36 7/ the only layer that truly needs to be proof of work is the base industrial money layer (#bitcoin) staychain transactions will let all sorts of 2nd layer networks develop & give “federation consensus” or “proof of stake” models the security that they’re chain can’t be forked
6725 2018-09-17 07:01:36 6/ so by extension and if successful, if you’re a new 2nd layer token or blockchain and you’re not attesting back to the most secured database (bitcoin), you better have a damn good reason why you’re not to your token holders and/or shareholders
6726 2018-09-17 07:01:36 5/ Signing a genesis transaction of a new token or dapp to the main #bitcoin chain will act as a type of security insurance policy & instantly make your blockchain more secure than competitive coins
6727 2018-09-17 07:01:35 4/ By anchoring the staychain transaction ID into genesis block of the sidechain it becomes impossible to roll back or re-write the state of the sidechain without also rolling back the staychain, which is effectively impossible due to the might of Bitcoin’s global proof-of-work
6728 2018-09-17 07:01:35 3/ MainStay - employs the underlying concept of a staychain of linked transactions within the #Bitcoin mainchain, where all transactions in the staychain are enforced to conform to a single output, preventing branching and any possibility of alternate record
histories.
6729 2018-09-17 07:01:34 2/ therefore alternative consensus mechanisms & 2nd level #blockchains on top of bitcoin can be used to build more advanced features without jeopardizing the security or decentralization of the base level that only POW with small blocks has delivered
6730 2018-09-17 07:01:34 1/ Their protocol *Mainstay* allows 2nd layer #blockchians and #dapps to develop & scale while taking advantage of the bitcoin POW security. 2nd level sidechains & dapps will "attest & timestamp" their databases directly into the main bitcoin chain

6909 2018-09-17 06:25:14 Any public system of high value will be targeted without a doubt. Ripple is on the same dart board as Apple, Amazon, Facebook etc. And im sure XRPL is on the same dart board as every crypto ever.

6937 2018-09-17 06:20:38 One major difference between gold/silver and crypto is the ease of use. Government can confiscate gold/silver but they can't touch our crypto.  It's much more difficult for people to hold and spend gold as oppose to crypto. The future of crypto isn't so grim, quit the negativity.

7042 2018-09-17 06:00:30 ICOs needs to be regulated, too many scams, they attract inexperienced investors who get rekt in the end. Not good for crypto overall. Money should flow into projects with substance, not spread among thousands of mediocre ones.

7068 2018-09-17 05:52:58 Crypto-pluralism is essential. Better a conflation of clashing ideas than a forced monoculture. Let market forces decide what lives or dies. It is a better decision-maker than forced consensus.

7113 2018-09-17 05:43:14 For #blockchain and $BTC technology to reach mass adoption, big corporations have to find use cases for it (other than as a currency).

7171 2018-09-17 05:27:26 Have slept better when close all positions before going to sleep!  Tip I got from @BigCheds. Crypto is 24/7 so don’t need to be on top of it 24/7 ! No need to catch knives nor the Top.  Must learn to make profits in the middle to avoid capital loss!   Till tomorrow then !

7229 2018-09-17 05:13:09 It's absolutely not required. It's software. Banks use xRapid but skip the xrp token most the time. It is very misleading thing they do. They try to give these clients xrp tokens in hopes of them using them. DYOR. Ripple was my first crypto sadly.

7296 2018-09-17 04:57:29 Even if crypto and dApps as a whole end up failing, there's a good chance they will have forced the rent-seeking incumbents to innovate, i.e. we the people may still have won. Even in failure "BitTorrent, created the conditions that allowed Netflix and Spotify to exist"-@backus
7297 2018-09-17 04:56:24 Maybe, but why not p&d in previous alt seasons? Much easier than current BTC market. Today you would need BTC plunge protection as well - engineer an alt season.  Possible I suppose. August $BTC price action more likely IMO. Grind up & dump to ~5800.
7298 2018-09-17 04:56:05 Why would they send it to binance then? If they were going to cash out, they would just cash out. You can't just cash out in binance
7299 2018-09-17 04:55:40 Patience: do not sell $BTC.
Procrastination: do not wait for tomorrow to buy $BTC.

7440 2018-09-17 04:20:11 Gold is an asset..like a freehold houses.
You will definitely sell em..when you're totally broke.

But crypto is current assets a form of currency to replace the fiat money.

You still sell gold to buy crypto in future.

At this point this is my thoughts.cheers

7543 2018-09-17 03:53:50 I’ve talked to some old school crypto people who loved the promise of a decentralized future; they’ve lost all hope because crypto is now completely overtaken by profit-seekers, but visionaries. Their words, not mine.

7550 2018-09-17 03:51:09 The bigger issue is that he paints anyone who is super intro crypto as radical right wing and this is radically false . Many left leaning (or even radical left) are also into crypto for a variety of reasons.

7552 2018-09-17 03:50:25 If because of the price volatility of Crypto token, RBI feels it can not be used as medium of exchange, then at least for now it should not be restricted for trading. And they should suggest to regulate it, instead of banning banking services. RBI don't take a biased decision.

7578 2018-09-17 03:44:50 RBI put all the negatives about Crypto and didn't feel to put a single positive thing. Those negatives are most irrational for future prospects. Cryptocurrencies are use case of the block chain technology. They are simply intervening the basic right of us for financial decisions.

7584 2018-09-17 03:43:56 I do not think he is doing economic modeling. He is taking it from resource allocation perspective. It is more about balancing.

7668 2018-09-17 03:21:55 Then tell everyone how great your crypto asset is and why its so good without bring others into battle to dis them. Maybe I'm being harsh but I think it's counterproductive when trying to engage with a broad spectrum of communities.

7677 2018-09-17 03:20:09 You may know how to trade crypto but you seem clueless on travel, get a back back get cash get hostels and figure it out, only way to learn
7678 2018-09-17 03:19:58 I agree. Effectively a mate could steel your crypto from your nano while you sleep with your pin number. I like the idea of an insured exchange with 24hour timed release and multipal layers of security.

7691 2018-09-17 03:17:09 It's not a BTC vrs XRP battle. It's tweets like this that cause friction. If your all about xrp and you hold no BTC or aren't interested in BTC. In my opinion forget about bitcoin, ignore it and anything about it. 
It saddens me to see crypto vs crypto posts daily.
7692 2018-09-17 03:16:45 The twins are doing everything SEC wants... They want they EFT finally aproved.... Crypto doesnt need a stablecoin or EFT, crypto needs Mass adoption and descentralized exchanges
7693 2018-09-17 03:16:34 So they are upfront about fractional reserve or is this a hidden?  They will still want to show assets for financial evaluations I would think. Surely this would lock up great supply and increase speculation from other markets.

7708 2018-09-17 03:15:15 Then as far as Hot the token is concerned price in USD depends on demand, demand depends on the need for computing power. Ie more people running or developing dapps then the more the demand. Thus higher price. Dont give false information, this is considered as FUD.

2. US officially regulating it
3. Facebook adoption

7788 2018-09-17 02:57:52 Like all the orher companies: #hashflare, #genesis etc. Even #crypto casinos are down. And I don't blame other people. They all are scary of loosing money
7789 2018-09-17 02:56:59 I've said it before and I'll say it again. Cats and #crypto do not mix.
7790 2018-09-17 02:56:48 Is this a sign the bear market is almost over when you all quit predicting what you think will happen next? Finally CNBC welcome to crypto officially.
7791 2018-09-17 02:56:44 When will you do crypto videos again?

7793 2018-09-17 02:56:05 The news is always the most bullish at market tops and most bearish at the bottom. #crypto #Ethereum #BTC
7794 2018-09-17 02:55:47 PFOF is perfectly reasonable in stocks, to be sure. It's important for folks to examine "free." It is misleading and ignores a lot of unknowns. Customers don't know, for instance, which exchanges/trading firms these crypto orders are going to.
7795 2018-09-17 02:55:09 In a field where blockchain has so much ability and respect, #BTCONE that can merge the current businesses with blockchain technology surely seems tempting. #Crypto #Bounty #NewBlockchain

7817 2018-09-17 02:46:10 Given degrees of counterparty risk wrt crypto exchanges, it’s unclear what optimal routing even looks like.

No-fee trading from your phone is great for a retail investor.

Unless you’re seeing slippage problems, PFOF freak outs strike me as concern trolling.

7834 2018-09-17 02:42:46 I think it would be nice for crypto community to get over small stuff and talk about positive stuffs rather than always getting stuck at same topic. I guess its the bear market effect that everyone is only focusing in negative things.

7861 2018-09-17 02:33:00 But in crypto, there are no standards for best execution. If they are getting PFOF from crypto exchanges, then which regulator is going to make sure they are routing orders to the venue on which they will be best executed?

7865 2018-09-17 02:32:24 This view lacks an understanding of value. If I am crypto-poor but I can raise beautiful delicious ribeye (value) I can sell it for BTC. I’m no longer BTC poor. BTC allows people to focus on value-creation versus money creation (especially fiat inflation).

7914 2018-09-17 02:20:50 I too had needs that crypto filled and Fiat didn't.  Also hope cypto can become the norm, but lost more people are going to need to feel a pain point do go thru the hassle of adoption, and any of these stable coins act as a easy to understand gateway.
7915 2018-09-17 02:20:41 So funny, whenever crypto gets brought up, there’s always a couple people who claim “i don’t know man, I think we just missed the opportunity.” But none of the whole group hold any crypto assets  lol
7916 2018-09-17 02:20:38 crypto wallets are not FDIC insured. ONLY your USD wallet , which no one really stores anything in

7991 2018-09-17 02:07:38 No.
No crypto can scale to become a global currency on chain.
Right now, Bitcoin can handle 7 transactions per second (TPS).
Global transactions will be in the millions of TPS.  This creates a requirement for LN.

8004 2018-09-17 02:03:17 It feels like it’s trending more towards businesses than money as liquidity dries up and investors mature. It’s the same as tech entrepreneurs being quick to IPO in 1999. The incentive curve is being shifted towards long-term, sustainable crypto companies/networks

8040 2018-09-17 01:55:20 Crypto is going to shito!!
8041 2018-09-17 01:55:15 he can sell crypto easily in MTL.... No cash no problem! Then he could find some shelter if ofc the story was true which it aint!
8042 2018-09-17 01:55:00 Lmao!  Wen crypto potluck?!
8043 2018-09-17 01:54:58 Anyone who shows their 100k+ wallets in giveaways are full of shit. Prove me wrong #crypto #bullshit
8044 2018-09-17 01:54:42 Are you aware that this is a counter indicator? It always show "buy" when it's overbought, because it's an oscillator gauge.
8045 2018-09-17 01:54:41 No one is pretending anything.   I see an athlete having a bad day.   Sometimes it really is just that.  Just consider it.  At least for a moment.   Maybe other days she’s mistreated though of all the matches I’ve watched I’ve never seen it.
8046 2018-09-17 01:54:12 Who are u and what have u done with beastlyorion
8047 2018-09-17 01:54:02 Only one. Gonna go back and keep plottin though. My homie wasn’t happy in there.
8048 2018-09-17 01:53:55 Omg it finally completely hit me. Insta clear. Its all about scarcity. They have a very well game strategy. Those  actions are indeed filthy. They shall pay for every single injustice made gainst humanity
8049 2018-09-17 01:53:52 nice!
8050 2018-09-17 01:53:25 Holly's a crazy bitch who accuses every leftist she doesn't like of being a "crypto-fash" with what qualifies that label seemingly being up to her alone.

8052 2018-09-17 01:53:05 Most people prefer "regulated" product by banks...not by exchange where govt tells "manipulation" happens. Its just what common man prefers who dosent want to manage his key but still want to own btc. Banks will sell same btc to many parties. That is what they do
8053 2018-09-17 01:53:00 ん、知らない♡笑
8054 2018-09-17 01:52:53 If we could get fiat converted into crypto and secure it...sure. Otherwise, parties that want a piece of the $200b, aren't the same that would go for crypto. I guess what I'm saying is there's a paradigm shift that needs to take place before the currency changes.
8055 2018-09-17 01:52:34 Governments will never give up their ability to impact monetary/fiscal policy or reserve currency status. Crypto will be more analogous to gold than a currency

8057 2018-09-17 01:52:21 Public blockchains might be that counterweight to the surveillance state, but I believe that nation states will strengthen their hand by mandating the adoption of scalable & stable (but not private) crypto fiat among their billions of users

However, a lot of people do not know how to, or see the point in, converting fiat for crypto to pay for a good or service... 

especially when that good or service can be paid for in fiat from the start

8086 2018-09-17 01:41:56 I wish I could be there, have the courage to quit my job and go full time crypto trader.
8087 2018-09-17 01:41:53 I agree
Also dont forget management, finance , ETC. I think for crypto to flourish we need teams to have employees versed in crypto with traditional backgrounds.
8088 2018-09-17 01:41:34 I thought you could live off crypto

8095 2018-09-17 01:39:23 There will be periods in your life where you feel like it’s the end of the world

Like the current state of the #crypto market 

But realize that it’s just temporary. 

The ones that stick it out will be gaining the most.
8096 2018-09-17 01:39:16 With the quality of photos you're currently taking with your phone a camera might not be necessary...

8103 2018-09-17 01:38:55 ETF’s like stablecoins are neo-Keynesian economic models at best. Crypto-currency is more or so Austrian economics. Its like mixing oil and water. Crypto is like water.

It's all a show. 
Follow someone more professional if you want to learn about trading crypto in my opinion.
8108 2018-09-17 01:37:42 Aw, thanks Euci

Or things alike .. interviews and conference talks and summits... i am really out of loop with others than those kind 
8113 2018-09-17 01:36:22 That’s not true - crypto or not there are mean people everywhere - either way this is really sad

8115 2018-09-17 01:35:33 #XRP is the epitome of having a cake and eating it. They want all the moon properties of crypto but also want to be seen as the cuddly, corporate version. On one side they're wearing a suit and the other they have temporary tattoos and pre-faded jeans.

2.) She is “generally” the “most amazing mom ever”, because aside from the extra things she allows me to go do even when the crypto market sucks, she is a really amazing mother.  It shouldn’t be that hard to dissect.
8121 2018-09-17 01:33:41 Lo certifico! Los invito a todos a ser parte de esta familia crypto y a crecer junto  a esta tan maravillosa comunidad en su canal de "Discord" asistiendo a sus actividades de promocion e informacion.

8131 2018-09-17 01:30:01 My FAANG question:  

What does crypto offer the consumer?  Is it all just tech that consumers will never see?

Facebook: connect with family & friends;
Apple: iPod, iPhone, MacBook;
Amazon: the everything store;
Netflix: entertainment;
Google: search engine that actually worked!

8140 2018-09-17 01:28:48 #Crypto $XRP Market Cap about $11.25 Billion and SWIFT is collaboratively worth what? Anyone know how much SWIFT is collectively worth? I want to compare Market Share. I know I’m not the only one.

8149 2018-09-17 01:26:34 into crypto. In truth our largest draw is to users who are new to cryptocurrencies both as a payment handling system and from the technology stance. We pull in more newbies to crypto than any other, so we tend to be very simple while being robust, secure, stable.

8163 2018-09-17 01:22:35 At some point in the distant future (no less than 10 years out), one or a few cryptocurrencies will trade on par with commercial and central bank issued currency.  Medium-of-exchange equality or superiority to the dollar/euro/yen/pound quadfecta is crypto's killer app.

8171 2018-09-17 01:21:28 wow. So there's like a form? why didn't somebody tell me this like 16 years ago

8173 2018-09-17 01:21:21 The InstantPay feature of #SmartCash allows a $SMART transaction to be locked in about a second so a 0-conf cannot be double spent.

Any crypto that doesn't lock a transaction can be double spent if preference to a higher fee is allowed.
8174 2018-09-17 01:21:16 NFTs are investments in the same sense that Collectible Art is an investment asset. 

For crypto, it’s the peak gamble for a Store of Value

8176 2018-09-17 01:21:04 You gotta pee look down and see a drain
8177 2018-09-17 01:20:38 Exactly. Because crypto needs more than devs and code to be accepted. I want this to be an option of wage in my job. For this to happen we need the common folk adoption of it. And because of BR this is ages behind. Do you understand that we're not all globally privileged
8178 2018-09-17 01:20:13 new crypto mining setup give me a break
8179 2018-09-17 01:20:00 Crypto needs everyone in the world to be armed with a cell phone/internet connection before it can truly compete with cash. That’s possible - only the elite drove cars in the 1920’s

8181 2018-09-17 01:19:45 I'm very captious when it comes to crypto. I determine to support a project only if the idea is noteworthy and the team is super competent. This project seems to be the one to trust into! #BEATRIX #ICO @BeatrixICO
8182 2018-09-17 01:19:34 Only if XRP and BTC people work side by side like good brothers instead of smear campaign against each other or honey pots.  Each side has know-how that the other side doesn't have.  If those 2 join the force, crypto the sky the limit. Minus Boogymen attack or the troll factories

8196 2018-09-17 01:16:06 それはtheDAOだな。古い貨幣で、もはや使われていない。昔は投資を加速させるための機能を詰め込んでいたんだが、いかんせん複雑すぎてな。どっかのアホが投資に使う原本を盗み出しやがって、それで計画がすべておじゃんになっちまったとさ。俺も現場を生で見てたんだが、あれはすごかったぞ。
8197 2018-09-17 01:16:04 And why the heck did they shorten overtime? This is going to lead to more ties. Had a feeling this was going to happen when they made that move.

8223 2018-09-17 01:10:50 in two decades, the arguments made today against fully-private transactions will seem just as silly as the arguments made in the 90s against widespread E2E crypto… and just as concessions then weakened security in this decade, so will today’s concessions in the decades to come

8257 2018-09-17 01:02:41 The concept of "virtual money" existed prior to the launch of Bitcoin.

Chase Bank patented a digital payment system in like 2005, way before Bitcoin. 

Banks don't like crypto b/c it could disrupt their "remittance."

8265 2018-09-17 01:00:59 Building a community is not just organizing events in paid conferences, running a few meetups on select cities or having so many followers in twitter and telegram channels. It's way harder than that. #crypto #community
8266 2018-09-17 01:00:49 My two offers as an IB associate in 2005 were JPM & Bear. I joined JPM in the industrials group and then in 2008 the Bear team I turned down joined JPM.

Anyway, all roads will lead smart people to Crypto. 
8267 2018-09-17 01:00:30 3/ The reason I engage with random trolls with long tweetstorms, is that I try to engage in good faith with the content of a debate, and crypto topics are usually complex and nuanced.  Wasting time with your constantly changing string of diversionary personal attacks...not good.

Before: Businesses have customers.
After: Projects have communities.

Best examples of community building. Bitcoin, Ethereum, MakerDAO. MakerDAO in particular (I'm a big fanboy)... They've got 90% less wallets than others because they seeded their network
8306 2018-09-17 00:52:00 Mine has been 100% crypto for nearly 3 years now
8307 2018-09-17 00:51:53 5/ We know that the chance of a major network, major technology, or form of money could get replaced exists. That risk will certainly be more prominent for crypto if it happens (again, after XRP in December). But pure blind faith isn't what will drive BTC or something else to win

8320 2018-09-17 00:49:53 3/ did indeed say XRP is replacing BTC and then when XRP fell 90% some swore off crypto.  Just as many buyers of BTC in Q4 have now sworn off crypto because of the price drop.  But the number of people affected are simply a rounding error of global population.

8329 2018-09-17 00:47:42 I agree with most of your statement, but if the platform has a real purpose, then you are going to have to sell outside of crypto if you are more than a trading play.
8330 2018-09-17 00:47:00 I was just reading about how poorly the Crypto market is doing. A Bloomberg article claimed its drop was worse than the dot com bubble burst. I wonder how successful the Winklevoss twins will be in the venture, entering at such a late stage. #bcstt #d
8331 2018-09-17 00:46:58 I’m not a bitcoin maximalist but I’ve been beaten up enough on alts that I will be far more selective about entering alt positions. I entered crypto the last week of 2017 my bitcoin delta is -10% my alt delta is -8k I closed at a loss. Still have a couple.

still does not mean one should not be ready for the market reversal

fine by me
8376 2018-09-17 00:39:32 Yes…
I played many PvP games such as fighting games etc.
That is very similar to trade, beginner never win against skilled player until they become skilled player like them.
It’s not easy, should spend a lot of time to learn and play, most of people will be retire before growth.
8377 2018-09-17 00:39:26 Nah I’m just saying the .88 was at 225. It gave a good scalp . But if we don’t beat that high again, we’ll fall down again

8381 2018-09-17 00:38:01 additionally, it seems contradictory to say crypto needs zero representation while at the same time saying that legislation and policy should be the recourse for “Main Street” to protect itself from scams
8382 2018-09-17 00:37:52 Dragonfly is a doji meaning no real candy body or up to 5% of the candles range where as a hammer or hanging man have a small real candle body

8385 2018-09-17 00:37:26 Hanging man is actually a bullish continuation pattern 55% of the time according to bukowski. But my issue probably what Nisson might argue is that there is not enough of a prior uptrend to quality this as a hanging man. It is a hammer imo

8402 2018-09-17 00:34:25 that seems preferable to crypto having zero representation in Washington. The alternative is congress believing the narrative that crypto is just a black market tool for criminals.

8450 2018-09-17 00:22:25 ofc, not expecting instant effect but still so much of strong resistance-packed zone above does not seem to let $btc slide into one
in decision zones like this we should always be ready for both scenarios, more than within regular trends

IMO showing crazy profit picture makes attract people to BTCFX.
Then stupid people throw their money without careful…

8530 2018-09-17 00:08:19 Recent crypto market price action reminds me of mid-2015. While the market regains its footing, folks who never believed in the tech continue to sit on the sidelines, pat themselves on the back, and declare the end of bitcoin. Oh boy, will it be fun to see their faces in 5 years.

8540 2018-09-17 00:05:28 I respect that. However, it is the flow of capital and game theory which are the beating heart of crypto currency, and foremost in Satoshi's mind during the creation of Bitcoin.

8542 2018-09-17 00:04:39 6.  If you have a investment in BTC / Crypto do your DD listen to the below and determine if the risk is worth it.  Most of these professionals come to the conclusion that BTC will be manipulated in the short run but they will not contain it in the long run

8547 2018-09-17 00:03:49 4. Now if a run on BTC happens and clients want 30,000 BTC transferred they could have issues like a bank run.  How does this hurt BTC price..obviously the scarcity factor is gone.  The volume tapers off like no one is interested.
8548 2018-09-17 00:03:21 3. 25000 BTC in stock.  They will sell one BTC to multiple parties.  No one will know the difference.  All the clients get a statement showing they own X amount of BTC.  So they have no clue they own a paper BTC.  ie fractional reserve BTC.

Easily worked around if you are running a trading bot.
