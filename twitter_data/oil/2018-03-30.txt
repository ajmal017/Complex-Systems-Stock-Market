2 2018-03-30 23:59:15 Syria doesn't have significant oil reserves, where are you getting you data?
3 2018-03-30 23:59:13 Ok. I am putting the oil on my list. I don’t use foundation, hardly, but I do put oil in my moisturizer. Also, I bought the Essence mascRa , for $5.99, and I am AMAZED !!! And I am picky on mascaras.
4 2018-03-30 23:59:11 i’ve had cystic acne for years and I reccomend : witch hazel, tea tree oil, sulfur (topical), and hemp seed oil. make sure to stay away from high sugars and gluten :).

53 2018-03-30 23:53:02 Agree long odds but it seems to me that Alaska needs some sort of multi-billion $ project (LNG? Oil? Tourism?) or else ....
54 2018-03-30 23:51:59 There is oil aplenty within the states. Why is it so few discuss the OPEC petrodollars as being exclusive to the us and how that is the scarcity involved? Fossil fuels have nothing to do with fossils, and there is no scarcity.

66 2018-03-30 23:49:47 I was yesterday at Opening Day. Worst food ever in a ballpark, very poor quality lousy selections and insufficient service. For example: they ran out of chicken sandwiches by the 4th inning and french fries were only oil with who knows what. I guess you can do more to improve.

89 2018-03-30 23:44:47 Please do inform me! You see most countries are eager to sell for cash so what country would not want to sell ? I do know the US did not interrupt ISIS oil export from Syria to Turkey.

99 2018-03-30 23:42:53 Sir...I appreciate you trying to help these little boys out who are selling oils on the train.  However, you won’t guilt trip me into buying any.  I don’t need any.  I have oil in my purse, and I know what’s in it.  And why did you need to ask my age and location to do it? 
100 2018-03-30 23:42:50 Give me a Chiltons and the tools and I can figure it out. I’ve swapped most things out. Change oil, tires, Brakes easy
101 2018-03-30 23:42:36 That calls for some olive oil, balsamic, onion, mozzarella, cucumber 
102 2018-03-30 23:42:29 My car needed new tires, renewed registration, and oil change plus there was a noise coming from the front end and my warranty is about to expire so, I just bought a new car today instead. American of course!

110 2018-03-30 23:41:39 yes this year I did my bedroom and saved a shitload on oil
111 2018-03-30 23:41:27 Hurts me more to know that all the oil rich Arab countries have forgotten their Palestinian brothers.
112 2018-03-30 23:41:18 I just did a hot oil treatment and a twist out and low key feeling myself rn lol
113 2018-03-30 23:41:17 Mere pocket change. Albertans generated well over $200 Billion net to the rest of Canada over 20 yr period leading up to oil crash in 2014. Still can't get pipelines built under Trudeau.
114 2018-03-30 23:41:16 The auto industry has always lobbied to make the mileage requirements easier. I am old enough to remember the oil embargo in the 70’s & how all the sudden everyone bought smaller Japanese cars that were more fuel efficient. Ford had the Pinto.
115 2018-03-30 23:41:07 Today I saw Chase, the part time "urban mixologist" who can somehow afford a $3500 a month Nieuw Breukelen studio, massaging beard oil into his lice infested red beard. So I massaged my size 12 Timberland boot into his Sabrett hotdog neck. End of story.
116 2018-03-30 23:41:01 Sour diesel is my fav. State of Ct uses their own genetics but they partially regrind the bud and the tops are dry. I use CBD/THC OIL In a 3:1 or 1:1 ratio to vape. My other oil is an indica with very high THC for Lyme.

122 2018-03-30 23:40:08 girl I can’t even imagine! Try castor oil for them to make them come back faster! I heard it works really well
123 2018-03-30 23:39:50 To be fair, haven't ALL the former EPA chairmen had their door busted down by their overprotective security detail while sleeping in the middle of the day in the condo he was getting a sweet deal on from the wife of one of the oil company lobbyists? Sheesh.

129 2018-03-30 23:38:57 I have but it doesn't seem to do a whole lot. I think I just gotta find the right one for me. Never tried tea tree oil though. I might look into that!

131 2018-03-30 23:38:34 Have you tried coconut oil it cools it and helps the skin not feel so tight.
132 2018-03-30 23:38:10 Could you? Oil prices are down and it would help our economy.

144 2018-03-30 23:36:05 During my NBA a professor once told us, the carbon and oil usage will end before we use them all, like burning wood for steam ended before we killed all tress. It is call progress.
145 2018-03-30 23:35:52 The only people who can’t see what con artists, liars and cheats the Democrats are would be the people who vote for them.  I never met a Democratic voter that wasn’t illogically obsessed with hatred for Republicans. 
They are beyond even conversing with. It’s like oil and water.
146 2018-03-30 23:35:45 Good luck trying to get that to catch on in the US. Plastic industry is tied to oil industry, soooo...yeah. This is wonderful though.
147 2018-03-30 23:35:43 On like, New York or Neapolitan I'm fond of the hot oil they sometimes have. Otherwise I prefer the heat on my pizza to come from toppings or pepper flakes I think?
148 2018-03-30 23:35:32 yah, i have been saying this for years. Cars and oil are in cahoots. Oil needs cars

163 2018-03-30 23:32:26 Yeah right....get paid like we are actually paid what is due us! I hope your mechanic gives you money to buy oil and stuff when u don’t have enough. Half of it is charity work on our part. Don’t bring money inside.

185 2018-03-30 23:27:56 No she doesnt have her own oil line. And shes my highschool sweetheart. But im bohemian and that isnt a style, its culture. The bohos use pastel colors cause its a natural pallet. And doesnt reflect sunlight for heat purposes...

187 2018-03-30 23:27:46 Went to go get an oil change and the dude helping me out was from fresno. What a small world
188 2018-03-30 23:27:34 I agree. But they seem intent on continually voting against these issues & for snake oil salesmen like their hero DT. They make it impossible to have compassion. I bet they don’t give 2 thoughts abt ocean pollution, species in peril, climate change. Selfish egocentric ppl.
189 2018-03-30 23:27:26 Lots oil

194 2018-03-30 23:26:39 @MindofSnaps Hi Miss Snappy. Hope you are having a wonderful Friday.
 After reading a bit and listening to the stream about CBD oil I more and more convinced that it is something for me, but how long does a single bottle last if I take 2-3 times a day?
195 2018-03-30 23:26:33 Probably right!
I did order these online & although they were palm oil free (that is a given for me) they were mostly chemicals & tasted really really bad! 
Plus they wouldn’t stand behind their products. 
I don’t miss much but I do miss those & candy lorn. 
196 2018-03-30 23:26:32 賢王様おはよ～

203 2018-03-30 23:25:27 Getting  close but still looking at the wrong  approach. Methanol, ammonia or hydrogen  are not as nearly  effective as synthetic  oil made from renewable sources (biomass). OCDE not being objective; heavily  biased by pro-hydrogen  European  vested interests...
204 2018-03-30 23:25:27 2) When the Christian Europeans were just starting to (unpleasantly) move into the area, the Pishtaco worked for the church.

Turns out fat is a great way to oil church bells!

208 2018-03-30 23:24:59 I got my spring break check, but of course now I need an oil change
209 2018-03-30 23:24:55 And my face is oily to begin with so trying to find a foundation/primer that controls oil is impossible for me smh

211 2018-03-30 23:24:48 There is nothing better than a foot/leg massage with hot oil. Oh my god. 

Except maybe a pussy/ass massage but that’s besides the point.
212 2018-03-30 23:24:22 Uhh no he's giving the Syrian oil back to the legitimate Syrian government, state and the millions of citizens living under their control. The Syrian army controls all the other oil fields not in SDF hands, not Iranians.
213 2018-03-30 23:24:19 Jis din world ko oil ki need nahi hogi tab antimuslim outrage bhi khatm ho jayega lekin usme abhi bahut time hai aur wo bhi hoga ya nahi ispe bhi suspense hai

217 2018-03-30 23:22:39 It's time to bring back an old phrase. Robber Barron's. Like oil, railroads and timber o stock market Schwab and JP Morgan. God I love the history channel.
218 2018-03-30 23:22:34 Strategic move will be the large and radical expansion of renewable energy and other alternatives for oil from the ME.
219 2018-03-30 23:22:20 We're going to play a game.  My payment for this Big Mac is at the bottom of this vat of boiling french fry oil.  Is your dedication to this fast food service job enough for you to reach it?
220 2018-03-30 23:21:24 The bottom line; these pipelines are illegal, they endanger our fresh water reservoirs, lakes,rivers,streams & unalienable human rights. Theres no need for kochs tarsands nor pipelines going through multiple provinces and states. Trump is a benefactor and big oil gang member.

222 2018-03-30 23:21:19 This gives me warm fuzzies, w/ bonus #geek ones. I lettered in debate, arguing energy policy in 1978-79, and proposing #solar & #biofuel as a long-term options for reducing dependence on imported oil. Even then, it was worthwhile. Now? Economies of scale are a wonderful thing. 
223 2018-03-30 23:20:49 That's what's up. I think it was my brother in law's aunt who was adamant that I didn't use palm oil so I never asked again lol. I'm gonna try it next time though and see how it turns out.

250 2018-03-30 23:14:24 Combination, I think. Especially combined with the oil that accumulates on the roads.  Some in SF are quite large as well.  

Even putting your feet down at intersections after it rains can be disconcerting, from the lack of traction.

284 2018-03-30 23:07:22 You dunno who Naomi Campbell is to African leaders. She was escort to Charles Taylor of Liberia and got away with blood diamond. You would be surprised if she got away with an oil mining license for her escort services. Prostitution thrives in all cadres of d society. So wake up

286 2018-03-30 23:05:42 Yes, wonder how much poor Alfie’s parents have stumped up, or been asked to stump up for this twaddle. Mercenary, self seeking snake oil, masquerading as an attempt to help
287 2018-03-30 23:05:27 Tesco tortilla chips are made with high oleic oil as are most of Marks and Spencer’s crisps. It’s called Sunseed oil, a trademarked product. I’d love a mayonnaise made with it but have yet to find one.
288 2018-03-30 23:05:26 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
289 2018-03-30 23:05:12 Wait what's wrong with baby oil
290 2018-03-30 23:05:10 If the oil drips make an interesting pattern, this piece of wood just might sell as a work of art 
291 2018-03-30 23:05:05 Literally they all used rice, tomatoes in at least one form, Nigerian Maggie cube & red palm oil. Other than that every single person cooked it differently. So I made my version based on what I thought was the bests about all the recipes.
292 2018-03-30 23:04:55 【resource】資源、資金(名詞) This sea is rich in natural resources such as oil. #toeic #英語 #英会話
293 2018-03-30 23:04:50 I love that the service department at my dealership knows not to play with me. Just give me my oil change and let me go. You can fool all these other suckers into paying for the extra shit they “need”.
294 2018-03-30 23:04:29 Whoever told african aunties to put loads of oil in food is a bastard
295 2018-03-30 23:04:23 Una directora de Oil vive con el "socio" del hermano de Ballestero. Habitan un departamento propiedad de Cristina Kirchner en Puerto Madero. Nico Wiñasky
296 2018-03-30 23:04:20 The State Department environmental impact reports have concluded that Keystone XL would have a degree of safety greater than any other crude oil pipeline in operation in the U.S. There are 59 additional special safety conditions that go above and beyond federal regulations.
297 2018-03-30 23:04:13 Yesterday I called myself moisturizing my  scalp and I poured tea tree oil in my ear by mistake... I need a MSDS sheet
298 2018-03-30 23:04:04 Flyer I got in the mail today: 
"FREE* OIL CHANGE to the first 50 customers with this flyer.
*does not include European, Asian, or Domestic cars"
299 2018-03-30 23:03:41 Yeah, but is that really the issue?  Whatever you choose to call it, it's a problem.  We have a climate crisis which means expanding the oil-tar-bitumen sands is off the table.
300 2018-03-30 23:03:35 True story: this happened at my work. Victim then dosed BBQ ribs with castor oil and left them in the fridge. Another co-worker went home that afternoon with horrible diarrhea. She never stole a lunch again
301 2018-03-30 23:03:27 Oil State above Alaska!  I hadn't heard either.  Great find young lady!
302 2018-03-30 23:03:23 Wow you are really off the rails! Do you think money grows on trees? It's expensive helping other countries. We have more oil in our country than any other country in the world. We don't buy oil from other countries because we need it. It's deplomacy. Do your homework!
303 2018-03-30 23:03:14 Just as they shared oil wells and resources to themselves
304 2018-03-30 23:03:12 Where can I buy the oil bbs?
305 2018-03-30 23:03:12 Fast forward to Sunday for the oil down and rum
306 2018-03-30 23:03:04 Patchouli oil?
307 2018-03-30 23:03:02 It's funny how everybody gives slightly different instructions! I like the flavor of palm oil though. The roasted peppers sound wonderful!
308 2018-03-30 23:02:52 I see a lot of people seeing success with @BahiCosmetics ‘s sunflower serum!!! It’s decently priced as well! I think $21 or $24 for a bottle of it?? If not I definitely suggest apricot, emu or rose hip oil!!

315 2018-03-30 23:01:59 I have been in such a slump lately but I started taking CBD oil and I don’t think I’ve ever been this happy in my life! To anyone with depression or anxiety you really need to check this shit out better than any medication I’ve ever tried!
316 2018-03-30 23:01:41 キャリアオイルの種類・アボカドオイル/ Avocado oilクスノキ科、果実。保湿力が高い、角質層へ浸透力が高い。かかとやひじのマッサージに。クセがある為メインのオイルに5-20%の割合で加えると良い。 酸化しにくい。浸透力は表皮への透過性が高い。使い心地は粘性が高い重く濃厚。
317 2018-03-30 23:01:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however benefits magnet.
318 2018-03-30 23:00:53 I've never thought this contract is aimed at the financial oil market: it's a buy-side contract with much in common with LME forward contracts, & seems to be aimed at producers & physical traders (& IMHO also at bringing down the global price during the next few months)
319 2018-03-30 23:00:27 L48 Dec +23kbd, Jan -69kbd... blame it on the weather/seasonal effect or more seriously on the tightness of the frac market combined with the side effects of high grading during the 2014-2015 downturn. US Oil production plateau will not end before late Q2 #OOTT
320 2018-03-30 23:00:21 My fish oil is made by ‘Bronson’. I like to think when I take one, that the oil was beaten out of a fish by Charles Bronson’s bare hands.
321 2018-03-30 23:00:11 Wash your face ebusuku and put castor oil on ur face. It helped me sooo much with my skin oil prob. Its not an overnight solution but it worked for me.
322 2018-03-30 23:00:03 We should maintain and enhance our military presence east of the Euphrates and at Tanf. The purpose should be less about killing ISIS but Trump can frame it as such if he’d like, and it helps prevent their return. Goal would be to disrupt Iranian logistical lines, hold oil fields
323 2018-03-30 23:00:02 ..thousands of retailers oil of man of blow!
324 2018-03-30 22:59:57 5. But this assertion fails to recognize that solar panels are not just energy producers-they help meet Nigeria's goals of 30% renewable energy by 2030, and #RenewableEnergy increases economic productivity and creates jobs in a way imported oil does not #NoToDutyOnSolar
325 2018-03-30 22:59:47 We will do it on the 14th Malice, don’t forget the baby oil!
326 2018-03-30 22:59:46 When I wanted to learn jollof rice I asked all my Nigerian friends and they all made it differently, but they all used red palm oil, so I always use it when I make mine. Also in yam porridge. I make it with roasted red bell peppers. It’s beautiful.
327 2018-03-30 22:59:45 An oil burner gets rid of smells better than candles or plugins
328 2018-03-30 22:59:45 Dial Soap has a body wash named Semen Oil? 
Oh. Sea Minerals.

329 2018-03-30 22:59:31 Since you used the word Energy I hope this includes our Renewalable energy producing families. They deserve the same level of respect as us old oil and gas families.

334 2018-03-30 22:58:14 You should try tea tree oil, it’s hella good for healing
335 2018-03-30 22:57:35 Yeah, I've got a whole list of shit I won't pay them to do. Air filters, bulbs, wipers... Hell, the only reason I even take it in for oil changes is that they've been free under warranty. Now that I have a vehicle I fit under, I can even do that myself.
336 2018-03-30 22:57:30 Especially since four decades ago we were in the seventies, - stagflation, Opec's jerking oil prices around, a huge recession at the end of the decade and on and on.
337 2018-03-30 22:57:21 Nope I don't but sometimes when I reheat leftovers I use palm oil for the skillet
338 2018-03-30 22:56:35 Like a lost puppy, Jesse can't help the combined notions of coffee and, well, Angela in a particular state of undress. He peeks into the kitchen, keen on seeing the doctor.

342 2018-03-30 22:56:30 Nope Soviet Union had Invaded Poland and both Britain and France had entered war because of invasion of Poland - USSR oil also powered German war machine
343 2018-03-30 22:56:29 Fast forward to 2023, Guy Fieri goes for a spoon and thinks he’s getting Marinara sauce in a pot but instead it’s bleach and motor oil. Before the chef can stop him, Guy eats a big double spoon full of the mixture. He dies a painful and horrible death before...
344 2018-03-30 22:56:25 Way to go Big Oil....How about the Oil spills that murder millions of sea creatures a year...and that pollute our land and water? How about the communities that are ruined with your fracking sites bringing prostitutes and drugs into small towns?Now UR moving into our parks.
345 2018-03-30 22:56:04 Yo Canyon, what's up with the canola oil? You had it right by avoiding it in your other breads.
346 2018-03-30 22:55:54 CBD oil is life.
347 2018-03-30 22:55:12 @HelloKitsies wax burners are taller. Wax melts will start spitting if you use them in an oil burner xx
348 2018-03-30 22:55:07 I did, because I use it. Especially when we run out of heating oil.
349 2018-03-30 22:54:44 I wonder how tightly they put the oil filter back on this time because last time I tried to change it I couldn't get it off. Oil and filter are supposed to be good for 10,000 miles but I'm too damn old to believe that (and I've seen the used oil at 5 and um.).
350 2018-03-30 22:54:35 Sure. You win. Enjoy the blood oil you ship in from Saudi
351 2018-03-30 22:54:29 Toss them with bacon fat, olive oil, garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and a shake of Worcestershire, and roast them in the oven. It’ll change your life.
352 2018-03-30 22:54:17 My personal metaphor is "whiter than the crowd clapping on 1 and 3 during the DMB halftime show of a Harvard-Yale lacrosse game being played in Martha's Vineyard."

But I like yours too. Adopting to lexicon.

359 2018-03-30 22:52:53 Wasn't trump pilloried during the campaign for statements about controlling the oil?
360 2018-03-30 22:52:44 Profits over people. That is the mantra of all corporations in the US. Nothing different about Facebook except they got caught. Oil, gas and coal corporations are doing the same thing.
361 2018-03-30 22:52:39 Looks exactly as you'd expect.
362 2018-03-30 22:52:39 it’s weird, I rubbed tea tree oil all over my body but I still have depression
363 2018-03-30 22:52:37 Not for money. Not for oil!
364 2018-03-30 22:52:35 I just bought an essential oil vape and everyone is making fun of me i do not deserve these attacks
365 2018-03-30 22:52:30 There are plenty of rogue regimes that we completely ignore ... seems we only get involved if there is something like oil involved.

370 2018-03-30 22:51:12 So, if I get this time frame right, a couple of months ago, American troops fought with a Russian oligarch who was trying to overtake a Syrian oil facility. Putin fires missile, Trump says we should get out of Syria. Hmmmm

384 2018-03-30 22:49:06 I came to get an oil change and they got family feud on and everyone in the customer lounge yelling out possible answers and saying to each other  “bet it’s not” “bet it is” “ah shit” LOL

394 2018-03-30 22:47:26 True. Next time, when your oil is on fire, cover the pan with a pot cover and put off the cooker. Pouring water is a terrible idea.
395 2018-03-30 22:47:10 My boyfriend and I went to get my oil changed and he let me thrift shop while he did it for me then paid to get my wiper and filter changed too. I freaking love surprises and him so much 
396 2018-03-30 22:46:46 I saved slightly more money than I needed and instead of saving that extra moment so I could use it for something useful like an oil change or gas instead I spent it on juul pods & hoop earrings I probably won’t wear. Whyyyyyy am I like this
397 2018-03-30 22:46:38 The US govt is not investing in shale oil. Nigeria’s govt has been wasting public money on a moribund steel industry. What private capital does is not anyone’s business. I’m afraid you need to find a better analogy. There’s excess capacity in steel production globally
398 2018-03-30 22:46:28 No palm oil tho? Or did I miss it?
399 2018-03-30 22:46:28 I foresee a long hot shower, cocoa butter oil, a fat joint and my bed
400 2018-03-30 22:46:21 Gee, I'm shocked a Trump appointee is corrupt. Add his rent to his security expenses, repeal of environmental protections, opening national parks to big oil. He needs security, I'm sure there are loads of people that would love his head on their wall.

407 2018-03-30 22:44:32 Question....why not build refineries beside the oil sands and move product around Canada from there????
Must have been discussed before but just asking why?
408 2018-03-30 22:44:11 I sold my Facebook identity to a Russian bot for 3 turnips and a quart of motor oil.
409 2018-03-30 22:43:49 Also I found that while the CBD oil pills don't really help a lot with pain, they help with anxiety? This is good. I need to get more.
410 2018-03-30 22:43:48 But coconut oil is bae
411 2018-03-30 22:43:48 Qatar and UAE are running out of sellable oil. Saudi Arabia is not. But thanks for confusing people into thinking they are the same.

414 2018-03-30 22:43:40 So Naomi Campbell is now an escort to old sai baba buhari. This was the same Naomi that was an escort for Charles Taylor of Liberia and she made away with a blood diamond. Only God knows if she hasn't been given an oil block for her services in the presidential other room.
415 2018-03-30 22:43:35 Girl I wash my hair everyday but only because I produce TO MUCH natural oil!!! They don’t recommend washing it everyday if your hair is dry or has little to no oil.
416 2018-03-30 22:43:33 How do ANY of these companies think a 17yr old holds any marketing sway?
417 2018-03-30 22:43:28 You probably fried them on a really high heat/flame. Let the oil heat up on medium flame and then drop em in. Couple of mins each side and you’re good to go
418 2018-03-30 22:43:28 Time to replenish my Bisexuality Oil

423 2018-03-30 22:42:42 I was reading my friends FB post about her "dabbing" some essential oil on her chest for better night sleep. 

But yano, the smoker in me got excited after reading the word "dabbing" then I realized...she isnt a smoker and she meant essential oil..

427 2018-03-30 22:42:03 Absolute, evasive rubbish. Name these academics here, now. We don’t buy into snake oil peddling bullshit, maybe that’s why you won’t. Our academics & research scientists dominate their fields, likewise our biotech & diagnostic developments
428 2018-03-30 22:41:31 Totally didnt break into your house and lather him with fry oil
429 2018-03-30 22:41:29 How about apologizing for his fathers poor judgement?

430 2018-03-30 22:41:28 I haven't even found Mineral Oil
431 2018-03-30 22:41:08 My housemates are planning on plying us all with tacos later tonight for dinner, then all of us watching Trailer Park Boys and Rick and Morty (and who knows, maybe some THC oil dabs). That actually sounds like a VERY good idea, so I think tonight will be okay.
432 2018-03-30 22:41:08 We can start with oil , gas, water, whiskey, fishing, farming , all the basic needs for a civilised society, all the things other countries would continue to buy from Scotland. All those taxes would go direct to Holyrood instead of Westmonster.
433 2018-03-30 22:40:30 I don’t mean to sound bougie but i only like cooking my food with olive oil.
434 2018-03-30 22:40:26 Ive never changed my own oil but I have replaced serpentine belts, batteries, fuses, alternators, fuel filters, hoses and radiators. I'll give someone that $20 lol
435 2018-03-30 22:40:15 I hate oil paint wow

439 2018-03-30 22:39:54 Ah. Jealous. I think I might try my hand at making some vegetable soup soon. That way I can control the fat/oil. Feel better soon!
440 2018-03-30 22:39:41 Washed and vacuumed my car, got air in my tires, got gas, air coolant and oil for my car, paid bills, got a birthday gift, got my nails and eyebrows done all today with my own money while some of y’all get it handed to by your parents. Hard works pays off 
441 2018-03-30 22:39:41 Why is olive oil so expensive, b.
442 2018-03-30 22:39:40 Scott Pruitt: Gee, I'm shocked a Trump appointee is corrupt. Add his rent to his security expenses, repeal of environmental protections, opening national parks to big oil. He needs security, I'm sure there are loads of people that would love his head on their wall.
443 2018-03-30 22:39:25 OIL AND GAS SANCTIONS NOW

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump
444 2018-03-30 22:39:25 Han chuckled, wiping the oil off his hands. "Have you been sleeping?" He asked. "I know people who have been in cryo for a long time sometimes have trouble sleeping."

448 2018-03-30 22:38:36 Its the bankers & I thought it WM that took Scotland oil & squandered  it. Big Che will be phoning Galloway to get his latest script & he calls others amateurs. He clearly doesn't know his arse from his elbow.

450 2018-03-30 22:38:24 When you say ‘Ketones are high’, how high are they. Also, are they elevated by consumption of MCT oil or by ongoing metabolic processes?  Am I right to be concerned when my Ketones exceed 5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) or can I let safely rise 10 mmol/L on my #LCHF diet? #Keto
451 2018-03-30 22:37:13 So I take it this is bearish oil?
452 2018-03-30 22:37:12 We are also lobbying for fresh oil. League has been 2nd shift as long as I've bowled it. It's such a crapshoot. New lanes and fresh oil I expect numbers after a month in the league.
453 2018-03-30 22:37:07 Is that an oil leak off the wheel motor on the second pic? Common site unfortunately on a nitro of our particular vintage. 
454 2018-03-30 22:36:52 So Tom Coburn is in the pockets of oil and gas, and using his influence to fight the revenue bills? Which part does he take exception to, raising the GPT to 5%? So he is against funding education?
455 2018-03-30 22:36:52 It’s weird they are pulling ads even though her show still gets 2 million viewers a night and everyone thinks she is gonna lose her job.....people will pay to advertise as long as people watch her show at some point

461 2018-03-30 22:36:26 So John you’re against Oil & Gas development in Pennsylvania? Infrastructure like Mariner creates jobs, tax revenue and growth. Marcus Hook was closed for yrs and now is up and running again. Safe development is essential and many PA residents are impacted what’s your stance?
462 2018-03-30 22:36:25 FACT: Sponge cakes were invented as a solution to the discovery of electricity in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.
463 2018-03-30 22:36:08 In what season? Summer, with sweet corn, cold. Winter with olive oil, warm.
464 2018-03-30 22:35:55 My grandmother's food is amazing after you remove the 10 tsp of oil from the surface.
465 2018-03-30 22:35:42 Went to get an oil changed last night and told the guy I’d kick his ass if something happens to my car... this morning my check engine light turns on.... off to kick someone’s ass I go

469 2018-03-30 22:34:45 Trying my best to stay away from products using palm oil, I never realised how many companies use it it’s crazy! 
470 2018-03-30 22:34:34 Told my brother we got an #apple #homekit then proceeded to watch him talk to my essential oil diffuser
471 2018-03-30 22:34:34 Burning that midnight oil...well okay not midnight...
472 2018-03-30 22:34:32 I used this and it's made my skin awful. I have a disorder in which I pick my skin too, this scrub made it all worse. I've been using an evening primrose oil cream and it's helping to clear things up. It's great for acne.
473 2018-03-30 22:34:24 You get moto
474 2018-03-30 22:33:56 Yeah i feel like a dummy for using acryllic tapers and smushed in a plug that feels a little bigger than it, (which made it bleed). Im just gonna let it heal, buy ear oil and get stainless steel ones.

476 2018-03-30 22:33:31 Cookies, motor oil, animal fur and fresh cut grass.

Weird combination I know.
477 2018-03-30 22:33:20 My routine is (obv ignore what u don’t have/ want to use): 
1. Remove makeup/ (oil) cleanser
- pat dry - 
2. exfoliate (1-2 times a week)
3. Cleanse 
- pat dry - 
4. Toner
- air dry (just a short pause) - 
5. Moisturiser 
5.1 serum 
5.2 eye cream

481 2018-03-30 22:32:17 Roasted red pepper sitting in olive oil for how Long?
482 2018-03-30 22:32:12 The worst use of oil is burning it, for fuel. We don't have to, except for the enrichment of oil producers. But when it's gone, we'll wish it were still around, for lubrication, and for manufacturing other materials. 'Can't do it all with whale oil. . .
483 2018-03-30 22:32:05 Definitely don’t use coconut oil on your face because it’s highly comedogenic and will clog your pores, just use it on your body if anything  Argan oil is amazing as well and won’t clog your pores at all.

494 2018-03-30 22:30:00 I did not stretch properly (with oil and tapers) ...I used silicone tunnels and just smushed a bigger gauge in and let it expand.

DO NOT DO THIS OH GOD I WAS SO DUMB

500 2018-03-30 22:29:13 Offshore wind is attractive to those who’ve never been becalmed for days during off-shore expeditions on sailboats.
It’s also hugely attractive to the offshore oil and gas industry as a way to capture government assistance while employing skills & infrastructure...

522 2018-03-30 22:25:06 I need someone to invent an essential oil called “Leave me the fuck alone”. They’ll make billions and be heroes.

528 2018-03-30 22:24:33 You should be boiled in oil. I'll deal with it if you will. You won't be boiled, and Trump won't be impeached.

561 2018-03-30 22:19:46 Also, how much of that money goes into putting gas in your guitar and changing the oil on your drums?

565 2018-03-30 22:19:05 you really should. My suggestion would be to start with the paints and linseed oil as it doesn't have a strong smell. Winsor and Newton has a line of mediums designed for their water mixable oil collection

567 2018-03-30 22:18:58 Can we not form a club and fund rapids at normal rates say 15p kwh like the old AA and RAC someone out there must know how to do it we can not let big oil or corporations take over again
568 2018-03-30 22:18:22 روح شوف التريلر اما اني بشرح لك قصته صعبه ياخوك 
569 2018-03-30 22:17:43 Our first oil painting class is starting... thank you Iphie and our guests! Sam Squailia, Julianne Posco, Bessie Couto and Guest from CT and Kimberley Gaston!
570 2018-03-30 22:17:39 Can't help with the smell in the air, but to get it off your dog, use Dr. Bronner's Magic Oil Soap. Peppermint is best. Not marketed for de-skunking but works great. Available at Whole Foods or equivalent. Only product that ever worked for me.
571 2018-03-30 22:17:25 Übersetzung: Keep the oil!
572 2018-03-30 22:17:20 I hope you understand that you have such good skin, face etc others might not believe you selling "Oil Of etc"
I wasn't taking the piss.

574 2018-03-30 22:17:11 Every time I come get my oil changed, these niggas always finesse me lol
575 2018-03-30 22:16:53 fucking disgusting... that ecosystem will take decades to recover- fuck oil, coal, gas, mining, timber, etc. companies stealing and contaminating our natural resources for profit #WeHaveOnePlanet 
576 2018-03-30 22:16:52 New diffuser + new oil combos + new vinyl to my collection = “not gonna be able to make it tonight” texts going out.
577 2018-03-30 22:16:48 Bahahahahaha!
578 2018-03-30 22:16:46 Get some professional help
579 2018-03-30 22:16:45 "Oops, time to refill the oil." (Flame Man, MM&B CD Data)
580 2018-03-30 22:16:45 Chef Skinner cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with hot sauce.
581 2018-03-30 22:16:45 It’s not about the kids, and only partly about guns.  Liberals want to destroy a voting block of Trump supporters.  That’s why we didn’t hear from them when obama was president
582 2018-03-30 22:16:17 Lol trying not to stain my nails while eating is an extreme sport. Palm oil is not your friend 
583 2018-03-30 22:16:16 Also hot soaking in Epsom or Dead Sea Salts for pain.  Furthermore, Weleda makes an arnica massage oil you can run in to speed healing and reduce pain.  Lastly, glucosamine chondroitin with MSM is a supplement that can heal cartilage and its inflammation.

585 2018-03-30 22:15:56 Higher oil prices are a boon for American shale oil.
586 2018-03-30 22:15:52 Rock Oil?
587 2018-03-30 22:15:49 big 4 (Suncor, CNRL, Cenovus and Imperil) accounted for about 3 quarters of oil sands production at start of last year depending on definition of oil sands .  Likely higher to day.
588 2018-03-30 22:15:43 ピンポイントデブ面白すぎでしょ
589 2018-03-30 22:15:36 Nah...back-channel to oil, gas, coal, chemical, and mining companies.
590 2018-03-30 22:15:25 no i pay to use their services!!! maybe I reconsider the monopoly question when they get pass 70%...in the meantime I rather they go after Monsanto and oil companies and pharma and Tobacco!!
591 2018-03-30 22:14:50 and oecd oil demand only 4% higher vs. 2014
592 2018-03-30 22:14:47 What did you do with the one you borrowed? revenue  from crude oil,  TSA and other  revenues?
593 2018-03-30 22:14:33 OIL WILL BURN @OILSTANDARD

594 2018-03-30 22:14:01 Do you ever tweet about anything BUT oil, carbon, farming and sports!  There are other important portfolios in your caucus. #moe-ron
595 2018-03-30 22:13:11 Was I correct in my recollection that you said 5 Canadian co.s controlled 80% of oil sands output?
596 2018-03-30 22:13:09 The oils are kinda hokey. I use coconut oil or that conditioner I have
597 2018-03-30 22:13:04 pdp looted all the funds in the treasury right?  So what do you call unapproved $25b oil contract ,$44m kingobe NIA mess, the so called 500b social intervention fund, 11tr borrowed in 3yrs, NSITF, NHIS , Aso clinic mess just name it . I guess we should now call social saints?
598 2018-03-30 22:12:37 This people has ben in #Possession of those Oil wells since 70s,80s,90s.
Now,times has changed,as d rules has changed.the criteria for possession of an oil well back in the 70s,80s,90s should be different from d rules of d Year 2018.we need to review for d betterment of society
599 2018-03-30 22:12:28 Wasn't the idea of Peak Oil based on how oil production worked before fracking became common?
600 2018-03-30 22:12:11 So, overall - in the big scheme of things, it seems as if there is no real advantage to trading China oil futures over US oil futures because, once the hype settles down, they will closely resemble all other oil futures... it's about the global bet over national?
601 2018-03-30 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective
602 2018-03-30 22:11:56 anybody know where i can go to get an oil change that ain’t packed asf
603 2018-03-30 22:11:43 its old news but oil prices seep thru whole economy. HH debt or decent wages...which best 4 country??

609 2018-03-30 22:11:19 I'm from Anchorage and yes, Alaska has some stunning beauty, but it is a red state with one of the most corrupt republican party in the country. They came with the oil...New Orleans is an oasis in the south...well worth going. I also love New England...
610 2018-03-30 22:11:16 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
611 2018-03-30 22:11:12 Use tea tree oil to help reduce it
612 2018-03-30 22:10:57 Try black coffee with MCT oil... I'm having trouble letting go of my soy lattes but I'm honestly finding the black coffee/MCT combo works really well for focus over physical energy
613 2018-03-30 22:10:49 The fact Aust has barely 20 days of fuel the lowest stocks of any international energy agency member is pathetic. Our federal masters are clearly incapable of doing anything oil companies don’t like. This is hi farse it must be remedied now.
614 2018-03-30 22:10:45 Use it Morning and Night consistently and you’ll see result. You need a good toner and moisturiser too. I suggest using Apple Cider Vinegar it works wonders and a shea butter mix of olive oil and coconut oil

619 2018-03-30 22:10:04 I'd get trucks with tank and transport oil from state to state
620 2018-03-30 22:09:51 This deluxe pedi which includes a sea salt scrub, leg and foot mask, warm milk and honey oil, a hot stone massage and paraffin treatment has me on cloud nine
621 2018-03-30 22:09:48 Of course! The mega green galaxy mask is good for oily skin bc it detoxifies the skin. The super pure serum, cleanser & priming moisturizer are also all great  also I've been using the body wash/oil recently and think it's good for all skin types and great sensitive skin
622 2018-03-30 22:09:20 Wow. The poor creatures AND the people of Columbia. They will never be able to fully recover from that. I hope the Oil companies are made to pay heavy fines for that.
623 2018-03-30 22:09:16 Being an adult is fun and all until you go in for a $50 oil change & end up with a $140 bill 
624 2018-03-30 22:09:06 I hate how much we demonize technology! I love sitting in front on my computers all day! I get work done! Video games! Music! Friends! 

Make sure you let some fresh air & sunlight in!

Take some vitamins & fish oil!
625 2018-03-30 22:08:52 On the silly side what if data is the new cooking oil, needed to make most dishes but never the main ingredient?
626 2018-03-30 22:08:47 What separates Trump's behavior from Saddam Husain's?U have the palaces,the oil, the man who wud do whatever he wants,if he cud get away with it.He only sees his interests,which somehow sends his base into a mating frenzy;and,feels no empathy sans a cue card.
627 2018-03-30 22:08:47 We aren’t in the Eurozone...have no plans to be. Also Norway is in the SM and accepts FoM. It also has vast oil exports...
628 2018-03-30 22:08:46 It's nothing fancy even. Just normal coconut oil  it works wonders on my scar Mtase.
629 2018-03-30 22:08:06 Exactly. He rode his bicycle to the school after hearing of the shooting. Hogg wanted to be in the limelight. There is nothing “selfless” about him. He’s self serving & a fake. A bully too. Sorry to sound so mean, he gets on my last nerve.

632 2018-03-30 22:07:05 If he does you will have dirty air to breath dirty water. We’ll end up just like Japan wearing mask outside. But hey you will have what you want no biggie. He will destroy all tge national parks and let big oil drill and coal strip mine them but hey no biggie

634 2018-03-30 22:06:37 lol @ the oil field workers at walmart today that wouldn’t stop talking so loud about frac until i walked into their aisle and then kept staring at me like a bunch of creeps :))))))))))))))))))))
635 2018-03-30 22:06:31 i worked so much with oil pastels and charcoals in high school my art teacher would’ve probably lost her shit if i didn’t use a fixative skdjsksk well now ur on the fixative train ull be able to ship as many as u like yessss i stan an artist
636 2018-03-30 22:06:30 Aioli is three things: salt, raw garlic, and olive oil. The garlic is ground and emulsified by hand in a mortar, using salt to both season and grind the garlic and olive oil together.

Some think it is acceptable to use egg yolk to help emulsification.

They are wrong.
637 2018-03-30 22:06:15 Is there any food more satisfying than a rosemary bread with a really good oil for dipping? #breadandoil #soulfood #foodie
638 2018-03-30 22:06:14 Make sure the foundation is water based and not oil based! Also, set with a mattifying powder! Especially in the parts of your face that get oily the most. Don’t spray too much setting spray (if you use it) because it can make your skin oily
639 2018-03-30 22:06:01 I wish I loved using canola oil in every prepared meal like you love using canola oil in every prepared meal
640 2018-03-30 22:05:37 You don't. Cut em in half, toss em in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, sprinkle anything you like from your spice rack and roast for 20 minutes at 400º flipping halfway thru. Put em back in the remaining oil/balsamic when they're done.
641 2018-03-30 22:05:33 other ones worth knowing are: remove tongues stuck to metal by pouring warm water over them; peanut butter takes gum out of hair; cooking oil is best when a head is stuck between bannister railings; rocks stuck in ear canals need a doctor.

644 2018-03-30 22:05:18 Exfoliators with charcoal are good cuz they can absorb excess oil better. As for moisturizer an oil free moisturizer is bomb

646 2018-03-30 22:04:35 Anything I can take for constipation except for castor oil?
647 2018-03-30 22:04:32 Well it comes down to Syria and the US in wanting there country for oil for the #Bush family and to bring back a drug. I remember reading this from a very reliable source.
648 2018-03-30 22:04:22 You are advocating the US to stay in syria because of oil. Typical neocon hack
649 2018-03-30 22:04:03 So y’all think oil dry ? Like bruh
650 2018-03-30 22:03:56 but when i do break out i just use tea tree oil on those spots. works like a dream!
651 2018-03-30 22:03:50 Yeah I typically only do salt and butter on my pasta. So that's exactly why I olive oil.
652 2018-03-30 22:03:41 Got my oil changed the other day. The woman helping me out was named Felicia. When I left, all I could bring myself to saying was ,”Farewell.”  She laughed. #missedopportunities #byefelicia

655 2018-03-30 22:03:25 #MTPDaily @KatyTurNBC Actually, it's Rick Perry who is in charge of energy. Don't get it twisted, he's an oil and gas whore too but Scott Pruitt isn't content to be a grifting/grafting environment destroying monster, he's doing it in 2 lanes.

657 2018-03-30 22:03:20 Ironic, you’d use a Tina Fey gif here in reply to mama @MelissaAFrancis post. Oil/water. 
658 2018-03-30 22:03:07 You know the day the sanctions were to go into effect s Russian oil tanker docked in Boston and offloaded. No surprise.
659 2018-03-30 22:03:05 Also with strong Sicilian background, I salt water. Only add olive oil if I'm cooking a pasta dish without sauce as the oil can prevent sauces from sticking to the pasta nicely. And please people, perfecting al dente is important!

662 2018-03-30 22:02:54 i use a vitamin c/e/hyaluronic oil, and once that’s absorbed, a light moisturizer by skyn (pure cloud). i have patchy, flaky dry skin and after decades of trying to find something that works, this combo does the trick and doesn’t break me out.
663 2018-03-30 22:02:51 Recently moved from IndiaRussia to the Oil Rig
664 2018-03-30 22:02:32 I have done that already naaa
665 2018-03-30 22:02:31 It's awesome, man. I maintain that before I heard of you guys, I had an Amazon cart ready to go with Magnesium, Valerian root, and hemp oil. I did the research, you did the work, we met in the middle and now I actually sleep. I appreciate y'all lots.
666 2018-03-30 22:02:28 I have a Furminator too. She just did it to me 10 minutes ago after bathing. Now have evening primrose oil in me fur. 
667 2018-03-30 22:02:16 We (US) protected the Deir ezzor oil fields that were under isis control simply to prevent SAA Forces from retaking them bc Assad = #bad. We're everybit as complicit in this garbage as that fool, Erdogan.
668 2018-03-30 22:02:01 Right, but that is waaaay out of date. Last spring Cenovus and CNRL spent $32 billion buying oil sands assets from Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Marathon Oil. Canadian oil sands companies have been on a buying spree the past few years.
669 2018-03-30 22:01:45 I've seen a number of investors call out the Goop financing today as snake oil

Kind of a risk, but admirable bc "If you see a fraud and do not say fraud, you are the fraud."

673 2018-03-30 22:01:11 don't you ever consider to split oecd (oil+prod) stocks on US and non US on your charts? it will be interesting (oecd  of oil stocks=us of oil stocks)
674 2018-03-30 22:01:00 and it gives you more of a traditional oil feel
675 2018-03-30 22:00:53 And all that, made with money from oil....

689 2018-03-30 21:58:09 The EPA needs to change it's name to the GPA (Gasoline Protection Agency) after all they need to protect all of Trump's oil baron buddies.
690 2018-03-30 21:57:47 Don't think this is the point though. Has questionable history with an African leader and was recently with a wanted Oil baron. Everything is off
691 2018-03-30 21:57:42 That's not African. That's poverty story. Next time u say: "you've not experienced poverty if u haven't use newspaper as tissue paper or using palm oil as body lotion."
692 2018-03-30 21:57:31 I swear I hate going for oil changes. Lmao. Be bout a million things wrong with your car. 
693 2018-03-30 21:57:25 was making a lil pesto pasta thing with red onions, tomatoes, extra basil and jalapeño only to discover that i was out of olive oil, so i tossed the pasta and cooked the veggies in coconut oil and now it has a vaguely thai twist to it and it's amazing wow
694 2018-03-30 21:57:21 AK is the only place on earth I'm aware of that is treating some form of economic land (oil rents) as common property. That is how this particular program accomplishes what SHOULD BE the goal of UBI.
695 2018-03-30 21:56:55 So Obama was their founder but oil is really what got ISIS up and running? His summations of global issues are really the likes of those discarded in high school debate prep. He has so few words. And worse, he seems to look at knee-jerk overreaction as decisiveness.
696 2018-03-30 21:56:53 I always put salt and a touch of olive oil in my pasta water.
697 2018-03-30 21:56:42 yung ginawa mo na lahat para makatulog ka. nagpatutog ng playlist na sleep sa spotify, naglagay ng sleeping oil pucha ala parin.
698 2018-03-30 21:56:37 Ask yourself why californians on average will pay a dollar more per gallon of gas compared to other states. Hint: Its not the not the oil companies or gas stations making gasoline expensive for us here.
699 2018-03-30 21:56:32 LoL, Ice doesn’t cover all of Canada equally. Don’t break your brain thinking about it.  Alberta can keep its oil, in the ground if they can’t find a better solution.

704 2018-03-30 21:55:21 I love being roasted for my bitch ass american accent. From now on  punch me every time I say palm oil like a bitch. Beat that shit outta me. I'm not allowed to say plantain neither without a side eye.
705 2018-03-30 21:55:19 I need to sell my hair oil, it actually works 
706 2018-03-30 21:55:02 Oil and water together, how can I be whole? I'm like this hair, all strands and hiding places, yet out in the wide-open too like the moon.
707 2018-03-30 21:54:55 Tonight’s Good Friday meal. 
Baby Scallops seared in Olive Oil with fresh Garlic and Parmesan Cheese served over Linguine.
708 2018-03-30 21:54:49 I met the CFO of Hulu on vacation in Kauai. Reeked of Ivy League, I'm better than you; not a gracious person. So there is that...
709 2018-03-30 21:54:47 Significant failure of Car 91 at chase. Tonne of oil on the circuit. #B6HR
710 2018-03-30 21:54:43 I smell of oil. Yes, I do. And do you want to know why? It’s because I went into a kitchen where they were frying bhajiyas. That’s how I smell of oil.
Today, however, is a day when fried food tastes so good! The rain, the rain!
711 2018-03-30 21:54:42 “let my body be broken, and my blood be shed, so that I could become a salve for broken spirits and an oil to soften hearts.” Happy Good Friday everyone 
712 2018-03-30 21:54:30 Oil and water together, how can I be whole? I'm like this hair, all strands and hiding places, yet out in the wide-open too like the moon.

Fortunately the oil will also run out one day and the murdering slave owning despots will  get what is coming to 'em.

723 2018-03-30 21:51:35 In the 70s I worked on an oil lease reclamation crew. The mud sumps used in drilling were unlined, merely filled in with debri and sodded over until it was determined that the chemicals were seeping into the water tables. Soon thereafter lining and total remediation became rule

727 2018-03-30 21:51:18 The fact is that we exploit the schism of Islam to sell weapons.
We exacerbate it to make fortunes, we invade and steal oil and then expect the people to NOT want to attack us.

The morons who do not expect terrorism are comedy gold in by book.
728 2018-03-30 21:51:16 My husband is the best... got us out and both our oil changes done today before I worked. I would of just waited a few more weeks with my oil light on lmao.

733 2018-03-30 21:50:14 it’s official as of monday schools are closed here in oklahoma for #oklaedwalkout
oil subsidies are much more important 
734 2018-03-30 21:50:03 #Tanning season tip: Wax before.Cooling gels, variable temperature warmers, and even OTC light numbing solutions improve comfort during #waxing. Scented waxes, like those with lavender oil, offer protection + fragrance.
735 2018-03-30 21:49:24 Oil prices always rise during republican administrations, no surprise there
736 2018-03-30 21:49:21 Spent most of today doing oil changes and now i don't want to do any of my actual work. I am done with today
737 2018-03-30 21:49:11 Ty! I keep hearing a lot about tea tree oil and aspirin too
738 2018-03-30 21:48:52 All I’ve seen in Texas is oil plants and big ass mansions
739 2018-03-30 21:48:48 Blessings and abundance to you as well, my dear. I also just lit my large green candle that I adorned with my fast luck oil
740 2018-03-30 21:48:40 this is maybe my fourth or fifth time working with oil. it does take some time to get used to but if we work through that learning process, it’s worth it!
741 2018-03-30 21:48:36 Note to self: don’t put cold water into hot oil. It will erupt. Everywhere and burn you.
742 2018-03-30 21:48:31 Canada is carbon neutral. If he’s concerned about the worlds output he would not be bringing in foreign oil as we know their emission standards dont compare to Canada
743 2018-03-30 21:48:25 A hole in the atmosphere? If you are a "flat earther" then please get a dictionary and lookup the word "sphere" as in this 'atmosphere' you mention.   dear lord.
744 2018-03-30 21:48:03 You’ve clearly never seen Fox News cover a movie before. Look up that time they were convinced that the muppets were after Oil Companies.
745 2018-03-30 21:47:56 I canceled Hulu last night.

747 2018-03-30 21:47:29 According to technical analysis Marathon Oil Corporation is looking bearish and ready to fall in price in the next 2 to 3 months with volatility around 1%.
748 2018-03-30 21:47:22 In spite of this tire thing. Yo I got *THEE* fastest oil change ever! 15mins flat at a Jiffy Lube. I was so shocked! 
749 2018-03-30 21:47:15 Is oil wet?
750 2018-03-30 21:47:14 That oil treatment my sis @AniasDezaree put on my hair before she braided it down has it feeling so soft two weeks later 
751 2018-03-30 21:47:14 Beard all the way, and with that one you wouldn’t need beard oil
752 2018-03-30 21:47:01 Yooo I need to tequerisi on the gas pedal. 2nd oil change & it hasn’t even been a full year 
753 2018-03-30 21:46:55 As long as his power buys him something he wants, be it irrational revenge on whatever irritant-du-jour catches his attention, or a hotel deal in India, Trump will lie cheat, steal, Tweet to get it. Down to the last man, woman, vote, drop of oil, and brick in the wall.

757 2018-03-30 21:46:08 Hmmm.  Quite a find given $5000 a month seems to be a going rate in the area...
And SUCH a coincidence it is owned by an oil lobbyist.  Another pillar of propriety in Trump's cabinet.  @CNN @MSNBC

761 2018-03-30 21:45:27 The entire oil complex is sooo overloaded long ...doesnt mean it wont go higher...lots of late longs ...but when this breaks ...the risk it to the downside
762 2018-03-30 21:45:11 Of coarse they want to roll back emissions regulations. Their going to need sell all that oil being drilled in our oceans reefs to someone, why not us??? Environment be damped.
763 2018-03-30 21:45:02 I've started using a sterile face cleanser and lotion thingy and it's honestly so good to my skin I don't even need to use my oil control as often

773 2018-03-30 21:43:23 If you’re leaking the oil you’re leaking power
774 2018-03-30 21:43:23 Try to swap the coconut oil for almond - it really worked for me:). The rose is so soothing as I hate my hair smelling 
775 2018-03-30 21:43:21 I guess, you really lack basic knowledge of economics. If it was "high price of crude oil" that kept the forex rate at N197 during the presidency of Pres. Jonathan, what kept it low during the Obasanjo term? Some of you need a little bit of brain.
776 2018-03-30 21:43:20 With that in mind why would David participate in anything purposed by a lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist? #maga #dupes

782 2018-03-30 21:42:42 The castor oil is the magic - I’ve seen tonnes of people for whom this has worked. The almond oil is just pure protein. Rose is only to make it smell nice. I have long hair but it really accelerated growth after a hairdresser chopped off a lot!
783 2018-03-30 21:42:35 Oil on your floor? Call @WyattSivils or @haydenprice231 for quality spring cleaning
784 2018-03-30 21:42:34 We more often get rapeseed oil here as that is grown everywhere.
785 2018-03-30 21:42:21 Need to find some new hair grease. This  oil makes my hair grow back too fast
786 2018-03-30 21:42:21 I am currently using castor oil with coconut oil and i am not sure if it’s really making a different. But i have read about adding rose essence a lot. I shall try it. Thanks so much! 
787 2018-03-30 21:42:15 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
788 2018-03-30 21:42:07 This is a bad thing? Other than their obvious shit taste in alcohol?

792 2018-03-30 21:41:51 @RoyalCaribbean weird question. can I bring a jar of coconut oil? I use it for my skincare routine 
793 2018-03-30 21:41:29 It actually had its first service the day or so before I picked it up. Guess oil cap could be loose from that. We’ll see when the dealer opens on Tuesday
794 2018-03-30 21:41:22 -> So the actual title would be ‘Snowflake High Mysterious Murder Case’ (prequel to ‘High School Musical’?); the commonly seen alternative title would be ‘Snowflake Cream/Oil Mysterious Murder Case’.

796 2018-03-30 21:41:08 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
797 2018-03-30 21:41:05 I’m jumping into your convo randomly, sorry- came up on my tl:). But a really effective way is to mix almond oil, with a small amount of castor oil (its mega sticky) & add drops of rose essence in it- it truly makes hair grow:)

828 2018-03-30 21:36:16 Funding should get this up to £2 a share. Sucessful 30th round bid where reserves are tripled should double it to £4. First oil should get it £6-8. A multi drill programme of Liberator should get this into double figures in 2019. No better upside share on AIM imo  #i3e
829 2018-03-30 21:36:10 The nats are backed up by the press, dirty politics, bloggers like Whale oil, their proteges, and politicians who can lie through their teeth with (the 9 years experience). Even the most obvious lies just drip from their tongues like vitriol
830 2018-03-30 21:36:02 All I wanted to eat today was fried plantains in coconut oil. They're three for a dollar where I live.
831 2018-03-30 21:35:59 If I read Trevor's article right it is estimates of lost revenue to AB not global benefits from the pipeline. Money spent on AB oil can/will be spent on other things. Can't forget that climate hawks typically take a global perspective. 5/5
832 2018-03-30 21:35:55 same! I can deal with the swollen black and blue eye but the lashes are not okay. I am either going to get castor oil and put that on every night or buy rodan & fields eye lash serum.

838 2018-03-30 21:35:12 I've seen birds rescued after the oil spill in 2010. Nothing on TV about it. All goes to everybody's plate...into the plate of the orange plague too.
Birds who are affected by pollution are more vulnerable to different parasites some transferable to humans.Benthos is likely dead.
839 2018-03-30 21:35:09 They're giving me two free oil changes and I'm going to take valak and big red down there  imma be pissed if they don't I'm going to tell them that they owe me a detail then lol

841 2018-03-30 21:34:52 I just want to know how much oil got for the six.
842 2018-03-30 21:34:39 Personally, I believe that if you make it too crisp and clean then it may look artificial. Its one of the reasons why I liked oil pastels is because the art starts from a conglomorate of an oily paint mess to a piece of art.
843 2018-03-30 21:34:27 I freeze the herbs I grow in the fall. I portion them into various sizes of ice cube makers add olive oil. And freeze. Works great.
844 2018-03-30 21:34:24 What a bummer! We’re away in Italy for Easter, but have a couple of electric/oil Delonghi radiators in my dispensary- they’re quite good. If you want to borrow them, you’re welcome! (can get them to you)
845 2018-03-30 21:34:17 Oil effect from photoshop to NY Times picture
846 2018-03-30 21:34:16 I changed the water ratio to 1-to-1. 1 cup of water for every one cup of rice. I also add in 1 teaspoon of oil for each cup of rice. It prevents the rice from sticking to the pot, but it also cuts down on the foaming a bit. 

Hopefully that helps!

939 2018-03-30 21:17:17 Not sure about curls and waves, but Grape seep oil is REALLY good for your hair. Just leave it in clean hair as long as you can before washing it out, then do a dry shampoo before setting your hair otherwise it’s really hard to get out.

946 2018-03-30 21:16:29 I would imagine that car companies can certainly make more fuel efficient cars. They are making excuses not to. And I'm guessing the gas and oil industry isn't on board with that, and we know who is in the GOP pockets. Just saying.

1001 2018-03-30 21:09:42 Yet it is valuable to "them", like gold, for central of the same reasons it is valuable to "us"!… I can see central banks using something like bitcoin right alongside oil, diamonds and gold, for very large operations, and better tracking of float!

1015 2018-03-30 21:07:40 When u go to the dealership for an oil change and leave with a new car :-)
1016 2018-03-30 21:07:36 I usually pay $100 for an oil change . How they send me a discount email for $52 off and my bill end up $70 . How sway?
1017 2018-03-30 21:07:02 Yeah and if you're cheap like me, you could use $2 baby oil which accomplishes the same as any $20+ hipster oils
1018 2018-03-30 21:06:58 well you have to make sure youre using a rich moisturizer suited toward oily or dry skin after using an acid that works to control oil or encourage cell turnover they cannot be too light and thin I would also recommend a hydrating toner and hyaluronic acid
1019 2018-03-30 21:06:45 Go away .and don't use threatening language to me again.

1021 2018-03-30 21:06:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
1022 2018-03-30 21:06:16 Last night i came home real late (and lit) and wanted to use my smok. Instead of e-liquid, I filled it with argan oil. It did not like that. Rest in peace professor vape, your legacy will live on in my lungs forever

1031 2018-03-30 21:04:37 I literally just apply coconut oil on my hair & I wash my face with dove soap twice a day & I apply e45 after. It really pulls through for you skin.
1032 2018-03-30 21:04:33 Please read carefully. "They say they can't afford to pay us more yet they vote for crap like tax cuts for the wealthy and the gas/oil industry." We are NOT receiving less because of those tax cuts, but #45 would sure love to cut benefits for the elderly, disabled, and poor.
1033 2018-03-30 21:04:23 For my friend, she had to go on a diet for hers. I think u can search it online. For me, i lather coconut oil and baby oil in the shower. Tea tree oil and lavender oil also help with dryness and rebuilding skin. Oatmeal baths as well.

1035 2018-03-30 21:04:13 I’d say you should have a nice patterned oil stain on it, but if they’re working on their Harley, they’ll get one soon enough!

1046 2018-03-30 21:03:07 Where do I have 4 different candles burning, oil diffuser.
1047 2018-03-30 21:03:05 We use oil in a billion different ways including making plastics which make up 100 percent of our cars today and take us to and fro to work and play in cars,hybrids,public transport, etc etc. I think we get a whole lot of bang for our bucks not to mention 401Ks invested.

1116 2018-03-30 20:54:26 Peppermint oil and eucalyptus are my favorite for headaches. I’m good try rubbing into your palm as well. (If it’s the oil that’s safe for your skin.)
1117 2018-03-30 20:54:21 Where's that filthy oil fund lucre when you need it?
1118 2018-03-30 20:54:17 Sure the corporate tax cuts are the glaring issue... and a platform such as this is allowing for anyone to comment and not be hoodwinked by the likes of Murdoch and shirtfronting pollies.  But its alllll about oil coal and gas possibly where their and their buddies assests lie...
1119 2018-03-30 20:54:12 Thank you big oil for gouging the heck out of people on Easter weekend

1131 2018-03-30 20:52:34 Indonesia has been doing similar thing, not of bio-ethanol but bio-diesel from the CPO. The progress is quite slow but it would be faster if the fossil oil price becoming higher than the bio-diesel price.

1142 2018-03-30 20:51:34 Yes. There's lots of dairy free options. I have to find the flourless lemon almond olive oil cake.

No flour or eggs, it's rich and dense.  I won't even make jokes.
1143 2018-03-30 20:51:26 It's a good idea to make pollution cost more, and when oil companies do it without even a day's notice, it's too hard for businesses to plan for, since it's apparently a big deal when the couple cents called a carbon tax is the reason.

1145 2018-03-30 20:51:18 Wait, are you disputing the fact that USA has historical claim over Syria's oil?

As we all know, the ancient US tribe of Exxonia has lived in that part of Syria for thousands of years!
1146 2018-03-30 20:50:36 The smell is pervasive. Like oil drilled from the arctic
1147 2018-03-30 20:50:32 Mmmm, I love rosemary bread, esp dipped in olive oil & balsamic vinegar. I’m not usually as bad as last night. And I just ate a slice of pizza! 
1148 2018-03-30 20:50:24 My skin been wildin for respect all month and im sick and tired. Oil I use for my edges has my forehead in shambles smh
1149 2018-03-30 20:50:23 yesterday i did a tea tree oil treatment 2 my hair and i played a set and got a lil sweaty and all i could smell is tea tree oil and i would highly recommend to my long haired dj pals
1150 2018-03-30 20:50:23 U bet 2 grand the oil would win?
10 years of this crap and you havent learned a damn thing have you??!!
1151 2018-03-30 20:50:05 So glad to have a good relationship with my mechanic at Duffy’s Auto Shop in Denton. Needed an oil change before my long drive tmrrw and they close at 4pm but my dude Bryan told me to bring in anyway. 
1152 2018-03-30 20:50:00 I bought some olive oil and I’m LIVING
1153 2018-03-30 20:49:58 Yeah. I feel like an oil rig has more sprawling, labyrinthine potential.
1154 2018-03-30 20:49:30 Oil prices are mostly dictated by the WORLD MARKET. I feel sorry for you and your mother for missing the fact that no president can wield the power over oil prices no matter how they like to do so.
1155 2018-03-30 20:49:29 Yes, because USA has historical claim over Syria's oil. How dare the government of Syria think that they can control the oil in Syria?
1156 2018-03-30 20:49:05 I may try the biotin, I already have an oil that I’m using
1157 2018-03-30 20:48:57 
1158 2018-03-30 20:48:44 Big oil has the opportunity to be heroes.  Their gas station network has all the infrastructure needed to distribute green energy.  Greed?
1159 2018-03-30 20:48:41 How can we curb this illegal and risky oil refineries in our Helpless communities? The conventional method are not working, the modular are no where near, but fuel demands are high. Importation kills our refineries by deliberate sabotage, but none is interested to fix it. Sell it
1160 2018-03-30 20:48:41 First pan of fish I did with pork fat back, preheated. Started off great until it just all fell apart. Next pan, Did the high temp preheat, LOTS of oil. I essentially deep fried it. Ended up with two pieces that somewhat resembled fish. Next time skin on fish only.
1161 2018-03-30 20:48:22 What should I paint with my new oil paints 
1162 2018-03-30 20:48:07 @NickKoumalatsos @SlicksJohnny I went to get my beard trimmed today and the girl that trimmed commented how soft it was compared to last time. I told her i was using A new oil. She said she could definitely tell a difference.

1169 2018-03-30 20:46:44 @AliciaSilv We developed technology to quickly stop oil & gas blowouts & the oil and gas companies DON'T CARE! The earth is dying & still a majority of people don't really care! That's a BIG problem that has to be solved, FAST! Maybe teenagers should be put in charge of that too!
1170 2018-03-30 20:46:41 Buhari is simply not growing the economy; but selling crude oil and keeping most of the proceeds in foreign banks. He wants to score cheap political points in a predominantly illiterate society. Takes external loans to fund his budget.

1184 2018-03-30 20:45:09 @BretStephensNYT low blow Clinton to W went from bad to good.  What a freaking joke.  Clinton's personal immorality did not kill people.  Cheney and W's war for oil has destroyed millions, Americans and Iraq citizens.  You need a check on your moral center.
1185 2018-03-30 20:44:58 I swear everytime I take my car in to get a simple oil change , something else comes up 
1186 2018-03-30 20:44:52 Logic and Liberals is like Oil and Water....

1199 2018-03-30 20:42:38 WHERE DO YOU LIVE, Dianne and when is the last time you filled up a car in California?????  Our gas is north of $3.50/gal. because the DEMOCRAT MORONS IN SACRAMENTO keep raising our gas taxes.  THE STATE & FEDS make more money on gas than the oil companies you love to hate.
1200 2018-03-30 20:42:13 Its not really a thing. Lewis made it up and now fans won't shut up about it. In 2017 they burned oil in 'quali mode' but now that's against the rules. Thats all it ever was.
1201 2018-03-30 20:42:09 Honestly one very big Tanker
1202 2018-03-30 20:42:06 so i came to get an oil change and this man just took my tire off and i’m not tryna do all that today

1210 2018-03-30 20:41:01 Holiday weekend and the price of oil has been going up so gas prices follows. 
I found some for 2.49 today I was happy with that price considering the prices elsewhere in town

1214 2018-03-30 20:40:32 Today I got my oil changed and overheard the woman sitting beside me call her dad to let him know her daughter's school was in lockdown because there was an active shooter roaming the halls.

It may not have affected you personally, but this threat is a lot closer than you think.

1223 2018-03-30 20:39:55 Normand, only a very small part of Alberta crude is considered “dirty”. However, that same so called “dirty” oil has been sent to refineries in the US for upgrading and burning in cars, trucks, boats, lawn mowers, ships, cranes (you get the picture) for well over 50 years.

1229 2018-03-30 20:38:16 Why does this gov feel the only resources our country has to offer is foul FINITE  oil and gas. So narrow minded, disrespectful and void of creativity.
We have prized INFINITE resourses like farmland, lifestyle,  science and technology. Dont toss baby out with the bath water.
1230 2018-03-30 20:37:55 The top 3 African countries with the most crude oil reserves (Libya, Nigeria and Somalia) are all terrorized.
1231 2018-03-30 20:37:51 I like to call a spade, a spade. 

You PDP and APC need to shut your trap! We were experiencing oil boom during GEJ's era from the international market yet, that is the mediocre result you could celebrate in comparison to the present suffering of Nigerians from an inept govt
1232 2018-03-30 20:37:50 It's 1:30, I've worked out, cleaned my room, cleaned the house, got an oil change, washed and vacuumed my car, and did my laundry. I am unstoppable today.
1233 2018-03-30 20:37:44 lol yall let these influencers convince yall that drinking 2 gallons of water a day, slathering comedogenic coconut oil on YOUR FACE, and not shampooing your hair will make you look good?
1234 2018-03-30 20:37:32 my dad can hold a grudge longer than anyone i know. he still wont get gas from bp bc the oil spill affected his hometown lol
1235 2018-03-30 20:37:29 the head of epa (United states environmental protection agency) used to work for an OIL COMPANY and has no experience in environmental science

It's actually really good.
1240 2018-03-30 20:36:16 My serious reply is that even oil execs know that Alberta crude is stupid expensive to process and only shitty political decisions make it an appealing option.
1241 2018-03-30 20:36:10 RIGHT?! i'm obsessed. have you tried luna oil yet? that's another one of my must-haves in my skincare regimen.
1242 2018-03-30 20:36:01 managed to get an oil change and wash my car today, which means I've officially accomplished all my spring break life chores, also I enjoy talking to the mechanics at vavoline bc they remind me of my dad

1244 2018-03-30 20:35:29 @EPAScottPruitt is unfit to tend to a houseplant. He'd probably oil it instead of watering.
1245 2018-03-30 20:35:25 Great story. But, respectfully, y'all are lapping at the edges. The story is about oil and power and the melting arctic, and who owns the resources. I pitched it to your colleague a year ago. He ghosted me.
1246 2018-03-30 20:35:18 Do we mine oil?
1247 2018-03-30 20:34:46 Putin’s goal in Syria is to block any oil and gas pipelines that would compete with his monopoly in East Europe. Pretty simple actually.
1248 2018-03-30 20:34:33 @BigAlpha things $XLE has going for it?
1. Oil Seasonality
2. Forward earnings estimates
3. Ratio of $XLE to S&P oversold

1253 2018-03-30 20:34:21 Well there’s no ISIS in Manbij, just a major oil trading hub. So they must be keeping ISIS out of the area... right?
1254 2018-03-30 20:34:14 Socially responsible investing should come with a perquisite to be socially responsible enough to truly understand the hypocrisies involved.  You probably don’t own oil stock, but fly on an airplane and drive a car and heat your house with what oil companies provide society...

Wait was that an oil rig
1266 2018-03-30 20:32:39 Now that China has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest oil importer, the country is seeking to end the standardization of oil trade in dollars, moving instead to the yuan. Make no mistake; this could mean death for the Petrodollar
1267 2018-03-30 20:32:39 Is there a game set entirely on an oil rig?
1268 2018-03-30 20:32:17 Does anyone know where I can get a cute affordable oil diffuser ?
1269 2018-03-30 20:32:09 The transition doesn't have to be itchy if you use a good beard oil! It'll soften up those hairs. I never grew a beard because it was so itchy until I realized just using an oil at night made it completely comfortable as it grew.
1270 2018-03-30 20:32:06 Haha not what I meant. I’m talking about the kids we went to school with who now work for Herbalife or Vector Marketing (pyramid schemes) trying to sell fucking snake oil to people
1271 2018-03-30 20:32:02 I’m at my car dealer getting my oil changed, and 1. they’re playing “Everybody Wants To Rule the World” and I keep thinking of Psych, and 2. Someone completed the Sudoku puzzle in the newspaper and SIGNED IT.

1274 2018-03-30 20:31:39 But you can put butter on it and then dip it in oil
1275 2018-03-30 20:31:36 Thanks. I don’t know what those chemicals are so wanted to check with you if any were oil based. I take it they are?
1276 2018-03-30 20:31:32 Side by side other oil producing countries could you mention for us at least three infrastructures oga Jonathan embarked on that is better than or compares with what those countries achieved within the same period they all made much money from crude oil.

1282 2018-03-30 20:30:50 The pervading culture of monoculturalism and mono product is detrimental to the growth of the productive sector. Diversification to ensure all value chains and economic integration via linkages will help break our over reliance on oil.

1287 2018-03-30 20:30:09 Governor's son CBN and one commission like that in charge of oil subsidy  that year (their salary is sooooo mad they don't even talk about it)
1288 2018-03-30 20:30:03 Why always about Miracle thou even as he's doing well. I can understand Cc fights but Miracle tries to behave yet his oil dey scent . lol. #Bbnaija
1289 2018-03-30 20:29:53 matt....who has a fake account here. kate is heids daughter and owns UKOG and FRR shares. An apology would be nice please.
1290 2018-03-30 20:29:53 It’s the oil wealth from Aberdeen than is being used every single day to make the city of London unbelievably rich .
1291 2018-03-30 20:29:34 my under arms r boofing  

tea tree oil is not on my side today. I gotta go straight home after this and swipe some secret on
1292 2018-03-30 20:29:30 It has to be in oil for me. Makes the best tuna salad. 
1293 2018-03-30 20:29:15 Wouldn't they have been journal bearings made of white metal and pressure fed oil to cool and lubricate them. That said, my experience is the rather bigger steam and gas turbine machines used in power generation.
1294 2018-03-30 20:29:10 Just generally, the best dye I’ve found, specifically for silver, is One ‘N Only’s argon oil dye. I believe the color is Chrome. Sally Beauty carries it, so I get mine there. Good luck!
1295 2018-03-30 20:29:09 Lol, oil paint for clothes paint ... I dabbled a long time ago but never really did much with oils. I still love to paint but I paint glass now. And I'm glad you liked my Fic it is a personal fave of mine.
1296 2018-03-30 20:29:00 I’m at Valvoline getting an oil change and they have a plastic bag of Cadbury eggs sitting on a fluid tank in the corner. Adorable!  #Easter2018
1297 2018-03-30 20:28:45 I was tricked into consuming oil of oregano last night, and can still smell it when I go to drink from my water bottle.
1298 2018-03-30 20:28:35 Just discovered that Argan Oil hurts when you get it in your eye. Ninight. 
1299 2018-03-30 20:28:28 I REALLY WISH I KNEW MY BEST GUESS IS BIO OIL??? BUT HONESTLY I HAVE NO CLUE
1300 2018-03-30 20:28:03 If you want to try something natural and efficient without side effects: Essential oil of citronella, one application lasts for 2 hours
1301 2018-03-30 20:27:53 #Agtwitter Does anyone know where i fill new oil in a Super A Farmall? No clue on year model other than olf
1302 2018-03-30 20:27:43 Mix Aloe Vera gel, Castor oil, gel from vitamin E capsules and put in a empty mascara tube. I can't keep up with mine now and my eyelashes have never been so long.
1303 2018-03-30 20:27:39 I could do with this multibagging!

1308 2018-03-30 20:27:02 Search Koch Brothers holdings. They also own pulp mills that turn wood into paper, they then turn that paper into products to wipe your mouth & your ass. Think Angel Soft, Quilted Northern, Brawney. 
Their biggest holdings are oil & chemicals, but hit them where you can.
1309 2018-03-30 20:26:54 There is only ONE way to eat bread, and that is with oil. Sorry I don’t make the rules.
1310 2018-03-30 20:26:42 #BackInTheDaysWeUsedTo use baby oil instead of sunblock.
1311 2018-03-30 20:26:37 I can change your oil for cheap if it’s too expensive wherever youre taking it 
1312 2018-03-30 20:26:30 We have a problem as a people- fixation on oil. An economy is supposed to run from all possible resources in the land. Management of well thought out policies is key. TSA for instance contracted the economy. It was a wrong turn.
1313 2018-03-30 20:26:13 You should see the pedigree of 'responsible' asthma inhalers. I once wrote sales copy [aimed at MDs] re a specific [expensive] inhaler. ALL the data was sponsored by the Big Pharma who were paying me. 
There's not a lot to choose between one snake oil peddler and the next.
1314 2018-03-30 20:26:08 Anyone know of a decent nail tech in Anchorage? Preferably someone who won’t tear up my cuticles or skip out on the cuticle oil
1315 2018-03-30 20:26:06 Scherzer vs Votto in Game One...nothing wrong with that.
1316 2018-03-30 20:26:05 Why is it every time I go in to get an oil change there's always SOMETHING else wrong?
1317 2018-03-30 20:25:54 There's been silence across the land as our Responders have been burning the midnight oil to complete their portfolios by 31 March. Almost all have now put this behind them and are back into the real world - starting with @hgregory1966  who will be #onatruck tomorrow #volunteers
1318 2018-03-30 20:25:48 That odd blended scent of vegetable oil, tobacco and ranch dressing that is emitted from dive bars

1320 2018-03-30 20:25:31 SO SICK of seeing that cannabis oil CURES Crohn's disease and all sorts of problems, if that was the case I'd be shotting the entire bottle but it's pish so can we all move on please 
1321 2018-03-30 20:25:23 There was a game on the C64 i used to play with my Dad, very similar in appearance to this but the cars were different and you could get upgrades such as missiles and oil slicks I just can't remember the name
1322 2018-03-30 20:25:21 There's no fake accounts. Why are you saying this. Pack it in .
1323 2018-03-30 20:25:11 Fuckin Jiffy Lube tryna charge me $98 to change my oil.
1324 2018-03-30 20:25:05 A United Nations Security Council committee blacklisted 21  shipping companies, 27 ships and one individual on Friday over illegal  #NorthKorean oil and coal smuggling.
1325 2018-03-30 20:25:02 Now, then....where to start....

...I can say another mobile phone bites the dust. And someone needs to oil a lighthouse in a coastal town beginning with North....
1326 2018-03-30 20:24:56 Mat , Kate is my daughter. She is also invested in UKOG
perhaps you would like to apologise?

1329 2018-03-30 20:24:12 I double bag mine in twitst tie gallon bags tie it tight and use perfume /essential oil if it’s a stinky if it’s just wet I just bag it and I don’t really have an odor issue
1330 2018-03-30 20:24:08 Send it to Freeport when it needs an oil change
1331 2018-03-30 20:24:08 Mat.what are you on about. I'm having a conversation.go away if you don't like it.
1332 2018-03-30 20:24:08 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
1333 2018-03-30 20:24:07 pig fat ,when i was young only butter ,lard and margarine ,no fancy oils and olive oil sold for ear pain sold by chemists in tiny bottles

1335 2018-03-30 20:23:57 Definitely over-functioning on making a Gefilte fish replacement for passover. Making some smoked whitefish. Homemade mayo. Some fresh basil oil. Turning it into Quenelles. Which I will serve in endive cups. With caviar. I think I missed the core concept here. But I love it.
1336 2018-03-30 20:23:54 Now they can figure a way to lower the price at the pump. Oil per barrel dropped but price at the pump remains high excessivly high in AK.
1337 2018-03-30 20:23:45 BTW, you're using that Bible quote wrong, Jesus wasn't giving instructions on how to treat the poor, he said it in reply to a disciple who Q'd why the $ for the oil a woman was applying to him wasn't instead spent on the poor. Do you know what he said the oil was for?
1338 2018-03-30 20:23:39 New Friday night special: Risotto, made with parmesan, porcini mushrooms, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes, and truffle oil and basil with a touch of lemon. We still have our appetizer special too: Clams Pancetta

1344 2018-03-30 20:22:55 Trying to explain to my mom how she can make dabs with a hair straightener and use an oil rig 
1345 2018-03-30 20:22:49 There are spurious blocks, too. A host of twitter users were blocked by LM over the meaning of peak trans/peak oil.
This wasn't even contentious YOU'RE A MAN stuff..
1346 2018-03-30 20:22:47 Todd isn’t a good coach. He hasn’t won anything in the NHL. SJ couldn’t figure it out with all the talent they had, and neither will the Oil with him as the coach.

1349 2018-03-30 20:22:14 OK, so WHO needs the EPA?????
Is this Pruitt's effort to help improve the profits for the oil industry?
1350 2018-03-30 20:22:01 First oil change
1351 2018-03-30 20:21:57 I even made lemon scented oil drops for my purifier
1352 2018-03-30 20:21:56 Hmmm, I’m on the fence, it’s the price tag relative to the productivity.

If the minimum Oil can offer this summer is 3.3 (as I’ve heard it said) then he needs to produce 20g, 30a and continue to develop into effective consistent PK contributor.

I’d prefer 2.5.
1353 2018-03-30 20:21:49 Each year oil and gas companies waste +/- $330 million-worth of natural gas through the harmful practices of venting and flaring as well as leaks on public lands. Tell @SecretaryZinke that Ohioans deserve their fair share of royalties from natural gas that is wasted. #cutmethane

1362 2018-03-30 20:21:01 Roasted simply with olive oil, salt and pepper. Parmesan dusting optional.
1363 2018-03-30 20:20:46 Joel, we do not recommend coating over the top of our products. Our Oil Plus 2C is a finish.
1364 2018-03-30 20:20:43 Mat ? What is your point here....?
1365 2018-03-30 20:20:26 Know Kate, The next attack on ukog imo will be from a creep called Tom Winnifrith.He will be sifting through accounts as I speak in his snake filled Greek field.He will say ukog are skint and need a placing. Take no notice :)
1366 2018-03-30 20:20:11 It dries me out so bad, but i also do have the acne under control now so it might be different  i use a toner with tea tree in it!! I’m too scared to dive deep into the moisturizer and oil world and i think that’s the issue
1367 2018-03-30 20:20:08 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to tolerate the harsh conditions of these fields.
1368 2018-03-30 20:20:06 If I follow up w a good hair treatment or oil after the shower that usually helps
1369 2018-03-30 20:19:56 You mix it with a carrier oil eg rosehip,argon oil or jojoba
1370 2018-03-30 20:19:46 Foreal?? Used their coconut oil once guess i have to hop on that! So you swearrrr your skin is popping?

1381 2018-03-30 20:18:22 make sure it's rubbed down with olive oil + S&P out of the fridge for a couple of hours before you cook it and let it rest!!
1382 2018-03-30 20:17:41 Does your dad work for Dodson? Because my dad works there too and he was just telling me about a coworker of his that keeps vegetable oil in his car for that same purpose....perhaps he was talking about your dad???
1383 2018-03-30 20:17:32 can’t tell if the egg salad i just made isn’t as good as normal because i used olive oil mayo or if it’s because my mom didn’t make it.  #everythingsbettermadebymom
1384 2018-03-30 20:17:28 I just had the first professional massage of my life. At first I was really self-conscious, but by the end I was really self-conscious AND covered in oil.
1385 2018-03-30 20:17:17 Adele is fab.

1395 2018-03-30 20:16:10 Trump says he's pulling out of Syria...where the USA has managed to still control Oil. Great news for Putin, who's been licking his chops to run the Syria show for years. 

Then again, The Donald changes his mind like its a pair of socks. Keeps life exciting.
1396 2018-03-30 20:16:00 Guess you dont like Adele then.....Someone like you.
katie sings that really brilliantly. She is a good singer.

1398 2018-03-30 20:15:46 WTF? This story smells as fishy as a Gulf Coast oil spill in August.
1399 2018-03-30 20:15:46 Combine 2 cups buritto with 11 lbs dates. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve on salad
1400 2018-03-30 20:15:40 This really a hill you want to die on? Is Target not going to allow her to buy baby oil today because Johnson and Johnson dropped her? TripAdvisior gonna block her IP from their website? Lemme know when they do then you can compare to the bakery.
1401 2018-03-30 20:15:37 What is it?? If it’s oil/ grease baby powder works
1402 2018-03-30 20:15:19 Internally screaming about Blue Tansy Oil as a night serum to @Jackie_Michele and @nicosantos as I listen to Natch Beaut at work. It is a game changer! $12 from Acure at Target, get that red card baybeeeee
1403 2018-03-30 20:15:04 It's backlash. The racists here went mad when a black president was elected. Oligarchs, in this to destroy democracy so they can rape the planet at will, took advantage, using Putin--a robber oil baron himself in bed with them--& his strategies to end democracy worldwide. Voila.

1406 2018-03-30 20:14:01 What are those muscle guys doing with them, when they’re all alone with each other at night? Once they oil each other up, shave each other’s backs, try on tight pants and flex in the mirror what’s left but to go home to your muscle wife and her deep voice.
1407 2018-03-30 20:13:50 The poverty that #Africa faces is NOT manifestation of capitalism, or of a lack of economic viability.
For the continent is the most beautiful on Earth, its minerals are near-unlimited, its oil reserves substantial and its people productive.
The continent's problem is SOCIALISM.
1408 2018-03-30 20:13:44 Brexit - the intemperate bore in the village pub who says from now on he's brewing his own.

He brags about it for ages then brings you some. It tastes like engine oil.

Then his shed explodes. He comes in the pub with his hair on fire & says it's your fault for not helping him.

1414 2018-03-30 20:13:07 Okay. So I do not care for the Maybelline super stay whatever foundation. I DO like the coverage, but I just can't do matte finish foundation anymore. I'll probably just use it on the areas I need heavier coverage and add argan oil to keep it from sitting flat on my face.
1415 2018-03-30 20:12:52 Don't normally do #ff but I'm stuvk in Guantanamo Bay after saying "oil" in passing so I have nothing better to do.

Shermer called Dave Rubin the next Larry King.

1420 2018-03-30 20:12:12 No, you know what the karma is for? Years of having no skin care knowledge, when I washed my face with dial soap until I was 28 and moisturized with olive oil. The universe saw that and will hold it against me until I'm 45.
1421 2018-03-30 20:12:03 The Cincinnati zoo has an entire webpage dedicated to listing brands that use sustainable palm oil and this bitch can officially have skittles again!!!

Thanks guys great service.
1423 2018-03-30 20:11:53 They add the oil to make it spreadable, and they are telling you it's canola oil because people think that's healthier than vegetable oil.
1424 2018-03-30 20:11:37 Legal implications my foot! In a country where the peasants do not oil the wheels of power, it is inconsequential! Ppo will only matter again in 2022. As per now, shida zenu ni zenu
1425 2018-03-30 20:11:30 I appreciate voices like yours - I live in Virginia where we barely got CBD oil - I’m basically forced to use #opioids when #cannabis could help my #ChronicPain much more effectively.
1426 2018-03-30 20:11:24 @ToyotaMotorCorp what causes oil pump failure in a Noah 2010 model yet I service the car after every 5000kms?
1427 2018-03-30 20:11:04 Pesto: when you want oil, but know you only deserve it with weeds and dirt in there.
1428 2018-03-30 20:10:59 There’s a tv show about oil changes on at the oil place

1438 2018-03-30 20:09:46 So glad my dad taught me about cars. I can change my own oil, tires & etc 
1439 2018-03-30 20:09:46 I too am ashy AF but I find sealing with coconut oil over your preferred lotion/body butter helps. Also whenever you can slather yourself in aquaphor. It’s greasy but really keeps the moisture in.
1440 2018-03-30 20:09:33 They’re just adapting people’s blog posts now, like that dumb nationalize oil piece

1448 2018-03-30 20:08:26 I’ve changed enough, the hassle isn’t worth the cost savings. Oil disposal, jacking the car up, the time and energy. Pay the money son, play on your phone. You’ll thank me later.

1451 2018-03-30 20:07:57 Don't try to get blood from a stone! The only thing @RepMcSally cares about is Bankers & military contractors!  Natl monuments are money makers she will give to banks to extract every last drop of oil before we don't use oil anymore.

2. Ask them to change the oil.

1483 2018-03-30 20:04:00 Today in 1940: During Operation Pike, the #British conduct a reconnaissance mission in the #Soviet Union as the Allies prepared to bomb the Soviet's oil industry. Though the Soviets were neutral, Britain and France believed the Nazi-Soviet Pact made them allies. #WWII
1484 2018-03-30 20:03:36 This is what it looks like in Galveston, TX. Why does the state require our vehicles pass an emissions test? Look at the shit the oil, chemical and Cruz fills the air with! #VoteThemOut2018 #ProtectOurEarth
1485 2018-03-30 20:03:29 The oil companies get subsidies from climate money. We the consumers get shafted with carbon taxes and higher prices for everything while China, India etc... take our industries because Canada is not a viable place to do business.

1493 2018-03-30 20:02:32 Yes, the mercenary group were trying to take the oil field the Americans were protecting. And the Americans (Maddis) weren't having it. I'm not sure how much longer the Manchurian is going to be allowed to do Putin's bidding. It's more than sickening.
1494 2018-03-30 20:02:26 I would buy a Tesla car hands down. I’m done with big oil and their outrageous prices for fuel. Help save the world you live in. You can tell big oil made the headline-Sensor issue is the recall folks.
1495 2018-03-30 20:02:24 When I was still working in a hospital, I was using thieves oil to rid people of MRSA.The western treatment is to bathe them in chlorhexidine daily which is horrible for the biome and usually wouldn’t work even with months of treatment.Thieves mist in the air for 2 weeks healed.

1553 2018-03-30 19:55:56 It’s the snake oil salesmen that irritate me the most.  I think that’s what this latest Hoaxumentary video is all about.
1554 2018-03-30 19:55:56 And then found oil, gold etc etc... unbelievable deal
1555 2018-03-30 19:55:54 I have nothing against BTP they saved my life about 18 months ago, and I have a good relationship with them. I was just interested in the answer about CBD oil because it is legal for medicinal purposes and hoped police were informed sure they were
1556 2018-03-30 19:55:54 Smelling like coconut oil and greatness
1557 2018-03-30 19:55:54 It was all because of my exhausting day, the soak in the tub with a lavendar oil packed bath oil, cold meds and the lavendar lotion I put on before bed.
1558 2018-03-30 19:55:50 Just bought some Castor Oil. Fingers crossed it works 
1559 2018-03-30 19:55:48 Au contraire to the foreign-owned thing...80% of oil sands production is controlled by 5 Canadian companies. Fun fact for your Saturday...

1571 2018-03-30 19:53:55 @FoxBusiness why are you not showing oil and metal prices today??  Checking oil everyday to see where gas will be is a huge reason I tune in. By the way @cvpayne I think it’s ironic that high oil is “positive” when millions depend on affordable gas. #MAGA
1572 2018-03-30 19:53:51 @gurinadarina199 
Life is endangered by our pollution. And plastic is made from oil. You got it?

1588 2018-03-30 19:50:00 You didn't have to add the last sentence. We know you're here for taxpayers and crude oil money, and prolly some old dick.
1589 2018-03-30 19:49:57 When I was a kid , people burnt their trash in garbage barrels , Now you can't burn oil , old shoes , pampers... because of the health and welfare of the public. As populations grow , so do laws to govern them.

1592 2018-03-30 19:49:37 Crude oil sold for up to $110 for about a year. External reserve when Dr Jonathan left office was$32b. I don’t think that’s the issue here. It’s more of policy that works. The present government took many wrong decisions based on wrong policies.
1593 2018-03-30 19:49:24 Is that from food or something like oil?

1595 2018-03-30 19:48:49 In this reality, how much would environmental damage mean to the jobless youth who are aware that the Oil is owned by other Nigerians up up country? How much does the burning of seized products mean to Aso Rock? Or are it's occupants not Nigerians?

1598 2018-03-30 19:48:36 It technically shouldn’t make it greasy but I know some people just don’t like the feeling of oil on their skin haha
1599 2018-03-30 19:48:24 Suggestions for how we help investors be better informed about the science so they stop investing in snake oil? We see little engagement with organizations of experts like @BehavioralMed despite the proliferation of pseudo behavioral scientists.
1600 2018-03-30 19:48:19 Here @Rubberbandits whats the craic with 26 x 28 cm Oil On Mr. Consodine? I've always wanted to know whats going on there!

Pruitt still and always has been working for Big Oil and Gas. Also was living in LNG lobbyists condo. #Resist

1606 2018-03-30 19:47:40 @EPAScottPruitt  Why don't you try running the agency instead of running all over the country in first class seats.  This country is not yours to pillage for you oil industry buddies.  Flint still doesn't have clean water and Appalachia is in the same shape.
1607 2018-03-30 19:47:17 i like myself like i like hot burning oil. scalding hot and will cause harm stay away omg

1609 2018-03-30 19:47:09 @BBCClick disappointed in this week's show. So much conjecture about what a certain company was able to achieve. It sounds more like snake oil. I doubt they changed the outcome of any election but sore losers don't give up. When's the next book from HRC?
1610 2018-03-30 19:46:59 It's in my contract. I need a private dressing room stocked with soft-boiled quail eggs drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with shaved black truffles.

1616 2018-03-30 19:46:30 It probably took me over ten tries for the Oil Stage Boss. There are around three stages I had trouble with and I'm shit at the Sonic 3 bonus stages. I do really like this game though.
1617 2018-03-30 19:46:29 So I basically spent about £6 and two hours of my life following a recipe this evening before I realised it was trying to get me to make groundnut oil from scratch fml...
1618 2018-03-30 19:46:21 It's all ball bearings nowadays. Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads. And I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze, preferably Prestone. No, no make that Quaker State.
1619 2018-03-30 19:46:14 What do you use for your hair Hun? It's stunning.. argan oil? Xx

1630 2018-03-30 19:44:47 There is no climate fraud. Even the oil companies acknowledge climate change. 2018. Try to keep up.
1631 2018-03-30 19:44:41 I wonder how red Martin county is and if any of those residents realize that the EPA is basically a front for an oil operation under their orange god

1637 2018-03-30 19:43:31 The backdrop of "illegal" refineries is events like Sen Ganduje asking SS folk what they'd done with the Oil, or was it 13%, the North had given them. Such is why local production will always have moral justification. You cannot separate the two

1642 2018-03-30 19:43:11 The point of Nigeria’s existence is its hydrocarbon resources which keeps the world supplied with oil & its elite content on corrupt enrichment. In 30 yrs, the residual value of oil may be too low for either. Either Nigeria finds a new reason to exist or it might cease to.

1690 2018-03-30 19:36:53 Before you ask. In 2012 California produced 197 million barrels of crude oil, out of the total 2,375 million barrels of oil produced in America.
1691 2018-03-30 19:36:47 Medical marijuana. Read about Rick Simpson Oil which is healing people with stage 4 cancer and a month to live. Big Pharma is ripping us off charging much more to US customers than in other countries. Blue collar people can well relate to that.

1701 2018-03-30 19:35:22 Supposedly, it's the other way around. US wanted pipelines from ME allies to NATO allies, reducing reliance on Russian oil, but must go through Syria. Assad was against it, so US supported rebels to overthrow him. To stop potential threat to their oil, Russia reinforced Assad.
1702 2018-03-30 19:34:42 Why is this place taking 5ever on a damn oil change ?!!!??!
1703 2018-03-30 19:34:35 That was a good amount of food for lunch, true. Had the greens mix on the side. Dressing: lemon juice, ginger, balsamic vinegar & olive oil.
1704 2018-03-30 19:34:27 A version of this story appears in the March 2018 edition of Oil and Gas Investor. Subscribe to the magazine here. Few people have accused energy of being boring. Frustrating at times, perhaps tone deaf to investors historically, but rarely has the energy sector been questioned
1705 2018-03-30 19:34:18 I can’t wait till im layin on a beach drenched in tanning oil
1706 2018-03-30 19:34:18 He also 
-destroyed our housing market
- destroyed our economy 
- destroyed employment 
- caused unnessacery military bloodshed over oil. Need I go on?
1707 2018-03-30 19:34:04 The trouble is, my solar panels are currently generating no electricity and yet we are using it and so need there to be another power source. I would prefer nuclear to coal, oil, or gas.
1708 2018-03-30 19:34:03 Why do you still persist with the myth that the Iraq War was an “error”? It was a deliberate act of illegal aggression for war profits, oil & global hegemony purposes & pretending it was a “mistake” implies that those responsible in any way care about its consequences.
1709 2018-03-30 19:34:03 Gee, that's need to me.  I wonder if there is, if we'd like to have it around & multiplied.  Just sayin.  
Maybe it eats oil too.  Oh that's the oligarchs.

1711 2018-03-30 19:33:52 marula oil smells so good.
1712 2018-03-30 19:33:47 Congratulations Queen.
1713 2018-03-30 19:33:43 Why this oil change taking forever tho
1714 2018-03-30 19:33:32 I thought we had progressed beyond the days of snake oil salesmen?
1715 2018-03-30 19:33:20 Misinterpreted, maybe? I don't know. No disrespect intended. Total moot point. We're not changing anything but our socks, anyway
1716 2018-03-30 19:33:10 This switch to oil from actual grass has gone way smoother than expected.
1717 2018-03-30 19:33:09 I accidentally took some chrome off on oil filler nut today and it broke me, it gets you like that when they are in good nick and looked after, sometimes we slip up and it hurts like hitting ya thumb with lump hammer many times

1720 2018-03-30 19:32:40 "last straw came late last year when he was asked to supply a report on updated oil reserve forecasts to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke before the tightly held and market-sensitive information was made public, a request he considered a bridge too far, ethically"

1722 2018-03-30 19:32:18 Wow. You are really desperate, aren’t you? I posted proof. But I get it, you don’t know anything about drawing. It’s called oil painting. The background is layout inspired. So, before judging, try to find the truth lmao
1723 2018-03-30 19:32:12 Ford Ranger breakdown the story so far:

Mitsubishi L200 - massive oil leak
Ford Transit Compact - it's a van 
Nissan Xtrail - I wouldn't buy one
...
1724 2018-03-30 19:32:03 can’t lose what you never had
1725 2018-03-30 19:31:52 I’m firm in my convictions that apostasy is real thing we should be aware of (essentially, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit). There is much false teaching already without the Tribulation having started. I want the wise virgins to see and prepare themselves with extra oil.
1726 2018-03-30 19:31:50 I think the Indy Eleven match at Lucas Oil may be the one to keep an eye on...both for the attendance numbers, and how Eleven will perform in front of that crowd.  Will they push on like it's just another game, or will they get stage fright?  A must-see game.
1727 2018-03-30 19:31:03 Is this at an auto parts store and all of the owners are in line buying oil? 

Sorry, I tried to make joke because I can't stop staring.
1728 2018-03-30 19:30:57 I hate how my sheets smell like oil i just washed them a five days ago
1729 2018-03-30 19:30:46 Mix 4 cups cherry with 2 1/2 pints dairy. Blend with Olive Oil. Fry. Serve a la mode
1730 2018-03-30 19:30:29 Independent oil and gas producer WPX Energy has closed a $700 million deal to sell its holdings in the San Juan Basin’s Gallup oil play to privately-held, EnCap Investments portfolio company, Enduring Resources IV.

The transaction completes WPX’s exit from the San Juan Bas
1731 2018-03-30 19:30:25 Service in our country is becoming extinct.  Told 2 hours to change oil and replace a piece of molding.  3 hours later still waiting and No one knows how much longer!
1732 2018-03-30 19:30:18 Nothing will destroy a car's engine faster than old oil. Do not neglect your oil changing schedule!
1733 2018-03-30 19:30:15 If voters STILL believe in Snake oil merchandisers like DJT, S. Miller or Jones - what to expect?

1735 2018-03-30 19:30:11 No. But I did read an interesting article that semi linked the lack of PTSD in the early wars to the oil canned tuna and sardines in early MREs
1736 2018-03-30 19:30:09 I knew those drive through, stay-in-your-car oil change stations were a mistake from conception.
1737 2018-03-30 19:29:58 This is olive oil, it’s never done me wrong before. Why is this happening
1738 2018-03-30 19:29:54 I got id'd for sesame oil in Sainsbury's before 
1739 2018-03-30 19:29:53 Sounds great.  I'll try just about anything with vegies!   After my non-interview yesterday, I got more red peppers, more olive oil and a bigger roasting pan so I can spread out the vegies.  I love to cook.
1740 2018-03-30 19:29:51 China could launch a pilot program to pay for oil in yuan as early as the second half of this year, according to sources.
1741 2018-03-30 19:29:48 wash... condition... deep condition, have a snack, rinse with a cowash... put in leave in conditioner/detangle  , take a nap... oil, and curl cream... don’t lay down for 6 hrs, put bonnet on, sleep. Wake up, curl refreshing spray , more curl cream and separate .. DIE
1742 2018-03-30 19:29:44 Arrest. The heart of the matter. Since it seems to not matter to you, I'd like to point out here that an underlying cause of the problem is the deprivation the locals feel about Oil and the distribution of its incomes in Nigeria
1743 2018-03-30 19:29:36 What is the relation pour oil with refused the marriage girl
1744 2018-03-30 19:29:18 Scott Pruitt pd $6100/6 mos for an apt across from the Capitol that would ordinarily rent for $5k/mos long term rental. Short term rentals are much higher. The lobbyist had oil/gas/energy interests b4 the EPA at the time. This is an ethics violation. #FirePruitt #Corruption

1746 2018-03-30 19:28:54 Just paid $70 for an oil change  they forget to tell you how expensive it is to own a fuel efficient car....
1747 2018-03-30 19:28:50 Folks, maintenance is necessary for many online games...Supercard no exception. Always difficult when it comes to world wide games to find an acceptable time. Better to get the oil changed now as opposed to buying a new engine. :)
1748 2018-03-30 19:28:36 True for BigCo prospects too. It's very prevalent in oil and gas companies.
1749 2018-03-30 19:28:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1750 2018-03-30 19:28:09 I agree. We should end subsidies. However, that is not the topic here. B.C. is specifically targeting AB oil via pipeline. Foreign oil seems to be ok. And oil by rail is ok. How about we boycott foreign oil 1st 
1751 2018-03-30 19:28:03 New tires oil change && brakes 
1752 2018-03-30 19:27:57 Poison no, oil yes. 
1753 2018-03-30 19:27:51 Disgusting mate, the US and UK fucked up their country up so badly for no good reason other than oil
1754 2018-03-30 19:27:47 I know people who have been "in between jobs" for 15 years

1758 2018-03-30 19:26:50 Gun oil in your food prevents constipation.  It also prevents you from controlling when and where you start your bowel movements.
1759 2018-03-30 19:26:26 everyone put jojoba oil in your hair it’s life changing
1760 2018-03-30 19:26:19 It he gos its what Putin wants last week Putin said he will go to war with the usa if they dont leave. they want there oil pipe line from assad to iran to go through.  tHATS WHY THEY R killing all those in the way to take there land.
1761 2018-03-30 19:26:17 well see the alternative is extremely high heat with oil dunk them they puff and drop them on a paper towel, fluffiest eggs ever so i guess im proving myself wrong
1762 2018-03-30 19:26:13 I want to try this to help with joint & body pain from chemo. I don't want to get high or smoke it, so gummy or oil is good.

1766 2018-03-30 19:25:48 If I started making soaps and sugar scrubs and shower/bath oil melts... would y’all be interested in buying some

1770 2018-03-30 19:25:06 ... (from 19th century RR and steel trusts to oil companies causing environmental harm to, now, Facebook)(liberals/progressives), from which the people can only be protected by strong government institutions and agencies which unlike corporations are accountable to citizens...
1771 2018-03-30 19:25:00 $70 for a damn oil change 
1772 2018-03-30 19:24:58 im far from blaming the oil industry, obviously the things that go on at the capitol are the main problem in all of this, but raising the tax to at least compete with the rest of the country would help tremendously.
1773 2018-03-30 19:24:56 wow benny's car wash is so cute they gave out complimentary bottles of water while waiting for my oil change

1776 2018-03-30 19:24:28 Benny’s gives complimentary bottles of water while you wait on them to change your oil. Thank you

1779 2018-03-30 19:24:14 My wife literally says to me as she’s walking out the door. “I took my fish oil this morning, so no matter what else happens today I’ve already won.”  Its the little wins, key to success right there!  @Jessicalucero97

1782 2018-03-30 19:23:50 What business? Coal, Facebook theft, Russian oil, air pollution, media... Not for people just corporate THEFT.
1783 2018-03-30 19:23:47 Terrific choice! If you need a little more "substance", add a bit of olive oil. It's Subway, so I doubt there's anything such as seeds or nuts to sprinkle on, or avocado slices, but some hard-cooked egg, extra cheese and/or bacon might be available. For Healthy Fats and Protein.

1786 2018-03-30 19:23:07 Oh good. I get to change my oil this weekend. Again. Literally felt like I did it just last month.
1787 2018-03-30 19:23:03 Got the oil changed on my car and got it washed and cleaned out for our trip on my lunch but now I'm starving 
1788 2018-03-30 19:22:58 Does that make you feel better big guy?  Now go off and have your creamed corn before they stop serving lunch at the home.
1789 2018-03-30 19:22:57 He was polishing his oil rig.
1790 2018-03-30 19:22:57 No, it's the result of us negotiating with the Saudis to lower the price of oil. Apples and oranges
1791 2018-03-30 19:22:47 American service member is among the 2 dead in Syria bombing, officials say | Fox News - Had no business, there! Did Assad invite US participation in DESTROYING their country & LOOTING OIL???
1792 2018-03-30 19:22:43 In need of some Argan oil
1793 2018-03-30 19:22:39 Don't even need to look at that, just look at the vote totals.

Same people who voted for Romney voted for Trump. There was no wave at all, 2016 was a suppressed vote year.

Probably because no one could vote against war, banks, oil, or their own oppression with either candidate.
1794 2018-03-30 19:22:27 No no no!! Dry skin can sometimes be more spotty because it’s trying to make more oil to overcompensate. Use moisturiser with no perfume and same for face wash, anything from Simple is the best because it’s not scented or irritating. Then buy some La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo
1795 2018-03-30 19:22:16 Seen a smart looking VW Golf sitting in a layby yesterday with the simple ripped off.  Council workers were filling in a pothole a few hundred yards back up the road . Oil everywhere.

1801 2018-03-30 19:20:54 Best rapeseed oil I have ever tasted!
1802 2018-03-30 19:20:43 man you oil guys sure are nervous about these lawsuits huh
1803 2018-03-30 19:20:37 Omg.....I hope u didn't ingest none of that oil by accident, was it edible at least?!?! lol #ConcernedFan #SarcasticTweet
1804 2018-03-30 19:20:30 Nutella still has hazelnut in it, but it also has palm oil. (It's cheap, and solid at room temperature, so it's a common alternative to the trans-fats that e.g. baked goods used for a while.)
1805 2018-03-30 19:20:15 im sure the saudis can survive a one day oil strike 
1806 2018-03-30 19:20:15 Oil!
1807 2018-03-30 19:19:58 You didn’t. What about your ISIS claim? They’re still a thing. The wall? Trump posted old pics from Obama era. Oil deregulation? It will hurt my generation but you don’t give AF bc you’re selfish & you have no empathy. You blindly spew disinformation & lack empathy. I’m done.

1811 2018-03-30 19:19:41 Why did I buy scented massage oil from Amazon? Almost sent my husband to work with old granny scented jewels.  I honestly wasn’t sure if one shower would be enough... it was. Sorry, Love!  Lesson learned!
1812 2018-03-30 19:19:37 A question for @BTPEssex cannabis oil (known as CBD) is legal because of such small amounts of cannabis residue in it, has this been informed to forces so if people are carrying it they don’t get that “cannabis warning” because it’s for medicinal use?
1813 2018-03-30 19:19:25 The point was that chicken bleeds when fried. You know, in response to the person above my comment? The blood can come from the bone marrow as well as popped veins in the oil. Thanks.
1814 2018-03-30 19:19:19 You don’t. Drizzle with oil, some good salt, then top with Parm

1827 2018-03-30 19:18:27 “at 2:30 I need to go.. I need to get an oil change” 

I’m such an adult!!
1828 2018-03-30 19:18:25 Interesting stuff on @SkyOceanRescue. Many don't have an interest in recycling as lots ends up in landfill or gets shipped abroad. The burning of plastic to generate energy seems the best investment for me (it's base is oil, 2x better than coal). Do it in the UK and create jobs.
1829 2018-03-30 19:18:18 I'd say the "other shale plays" are bunk, yes. The Powder is ~$65 according to @WoodMackenzie in @OilnGasInvestor, for example. I'd say plays like the Rogersville, Monterey and some others would take $100+ oil. Regardless, you can only drill what is in inventory. Can't just leave

1834 2018-03-30 19:17:43 The retro cars are incredible aren’t they?! I got interested in Cuba after seeing a couple of films about their urban farming. After the oil crisis they started farming every patch of land in cities to grow food. Incredible story of sustainability driven from adversity
1835 2018-03-30 19:17:35 Nothing better than having an oil change and new tires

1843 2018-03-30 19:16:28 Americans are addicted to oil, we love our big SUV's and we love to FLY all over the world, tailpipe emissions will not be the problem we have to worry about...No more Democrats in office, California needs to turn Red before it is too late..

1846 2018-03-30 19:16:18 I'm sure it is because "it hurts business". How long are we going to continue to avoid needed change simply because it is difficult? The market will adjust. Before crude oil, we used whale oil; I don't see anyone screaming about bringing that industry back. We just moved on.

January EIA914 - US oil up 6,000 bopd over December. 
January WPSR - US oil up 82,000 bopd (avg for December vs avg for Jan)
Must be the weather.   Still, the 914 data are well above what the weekly showed at the time.

1896 2018-03-30 19:11:18 You're not wrong, that's always an issue in a seller's market. They can set whatever price they want and we're still going to have to buy it, so for that reason I kind of doubt it's Big Oil behind this lol. Just dumb Twitter people being good ol' dumb Twitter people
1897 2018-03-30 19:11:16 I only use coconut oil. Better tasting and good for the skin.
1898 2018-03-30 19:11:15 The arrogance that you can control/influence how middle east runs is more dangerous than Iran taking oil fields in Syria. For the record, Iran was invited by the Syrian government, unlike the US which is in Syrian territory illegally.
1899 2018-03-30 19:11:11 Waiting at the shop while my car gets an oil change. Woman next to me is having a Dramatic Business Call, and I want to know everything.

1910 2018-03-30 19:09:42 Why do I hate getting my oil changed so badly..  ugh!
1911 2018-03-30 19:09:40 the average state tax on oil production companies around the country is ridiculously higher than it is here. most pay around 3% in oklahoma, when other states make over 10%. 7% of the billions these companies make would eliminate the gap we see in education, and much more.

Because Oil all the way.
1914 2018-03-30 19:09:24 What were his military objectives and goals? Wipe out ISIS really fast, take the oil? He said his ideas were secret but I don't think he truly had any. Trump asked the generals to give him a plan in 30 days to defeat ISIS. We do have to wait and see.
1915 2018-03-30 19:09:18 Girl Rose hip oil has helped my scarring soooo much! I got a bottle off amazon for like $14. The Ordinary has one also!
1916 2018-03-30 19:09:14 So back to my original point--governments at all levels are involved in pipelines; 2 out of 3 major pipelines were legislated into oblivion thus we lost access to major markets for $60 oil. Plus governments are taxing & regulating investors out of Canada.
1917 2018-03-30 19:09:13 Get ready to pay MUCH more!  GOP controls the country.  GOP is Big Oil's #BITCH
1918 2018-03-30 19:09:07 I do too- the oil/cream/herbs/whatever make it into more than just a bowl of soup; they add interest or texture or flavour etc and I've thought what and why, it's not for show. Not with a tin of Heinz tho, that's just weird!
1919 2018-03-30 19:08:58 Unlike the billions and billions given to oil companies who pay ZERO taxes in the first place?

1921 2018-03-30 19:08:49 Your body is as good as what you put in it. I make pure, amber colored, cannabis oil and vape it. I do NOT need burnt vegetal matter, like chlorophyll, in my lungs. Your mileage may vary, but I try to keep my lungs clean. Cancer/COPD are no joke...even if cannabis protects you.

1923 2018-03-30 19:08:34 I could only assume God is on the lions' side here. Mainly because lions are not obnoxious self serving Trump voting snake oil hawking hypocrites
1924 2018-03-30 19:08:30 Foreign owners are easier to bamboozle when they're not invested in the land they own and from which they get their jobs and way of life. BC is open for oil export b/c of tar sands and LNG temporary profiteering.
1925 2018-03-30 19:08:27 Every ten years, the experts reverse themselves. Remember when coconut oil was virtually banned? Now they call it a health food. I don't listen to "the experts" any longer.
1926 2018-03-30 19:08:18 Ed that what Dick Cheney and John Bolton lied us into Iraq to do. They have the Blood of 100,000 Iraqi citizens on their hands and 40, thousand American Soldiers all because They wanted Iraq Oil. Now we are putting these same people back in power.
1927 2018-03-30 19:08:05 TRUMP announced to a crowd he is pulling troops out of SYRIA WHAT??? Where is the GOP?? THe troops are protecting a CONOCO refinery. Where is the outrage from GOP oil is thier GOD!! they put TRUMP over oil??

1977 2018-03-30 19:00:45 People like you and our weather minister destroyed the forests, threw garbage into the rivers and flushed their west coast toilets into the ocean. 
Oil didn’t do that. Peoplekind did.
Oil comes from natural deposits of microorganisms, similar to chalk & limestone.

1981 2018-03-30 19:00:21  The producers extract oil from the sand not tar. Industry calls it oil sands.  Your logic is to call tar sands. 
1982 2018-03-30 19:00:10 This oil change taking long as hell
1983 2018-03-30 19:00:01 I need to stop playing and go get a oil change

Timber- “aren’t avocados bad for you”


1988 2018-03-30 18:59:03 Bitcoin futures were not needed for a healthy market. Take crude oil futures for example, they have a delivery date with a certain location to pick them up the barrels. Not the case with bitcoin. There is no actual exchange. Bad stuff for the bitcoin price
1989 2018-03-30 18:58:58 @H2OWise Just saw a @jamieoliver recipe that sounds yummy... mashed potatoes, peas, & brocolli. With a bit of mint sauce mixed in, and lots of butter & olive oil.
1990 2018-03-30 18:58:49 Don’t say this on any skincare groups on Reddit, I was banned from them for suggesting people probably shouldn’t use cetaphil, St Ives and coconut oil 
1991 2018-03-30 18:58:49 There's still oil in it (hybrid) shockingly lmao but tranny fluid is low. Thank God I took it in when I did
1992 2018-03-30 18:58:49 #AKLeg @repdonyoung @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan @AkGovBillWalker seriously BS, when oil companies are making a ton more money and Alaskans are being asked to give more. You fail. #GOPTaxScam #PFD

1995 2018-03-30 18:58:06 In that case, just make sure you use plenty of oil, and don't leave the pan unattended - I have a fire blanket in my kitchen, to be on the safe side.
1996 2018-03-30 18:58:03 My dad does pest control for a living, but he is so humane that if he finds mice or snakes on glue traps he takes them outside and removes them off with vegetable oil. With that being said, I third a mighty kitty.
1997 2018-03-30 18:58:00 Alas, never sight of the fact that Olive Oil is one of the most adulterated and or Fraudulent declared and Labled> substances in the Global Food Chain! @QUBFoodProf
1998 2018-03-30 18:57:53 Just did a session of #skypeascientist with a school in AL! I'm in NE! It was a great 30 minutes answering curiosities about oil spills and ecology! (you all should do this) @SarahMackAttack

2004 2018-03-30 18:57:26 Getting an oil change at a Ford dealership and they want $150 to replace the battery since it is a lot of labor to get to the battery - maybe Ford shouldn’t hide the damn thing
2005 2018-03-30 18:57:25 Yo shouts out sesame oil
2006 2018-03-30 18:57:18 Sooo people want to use more gas in your cars...that is a tax
Then the higher demand for oil will reduce energy independence dor the usa and oil might have to get imported from the middle east....all for what...to attack the climate changers
2007 2018-03-30 18:57:16 Don't your recipes include ingredients like potato flour, tapioca starch, coconut oil, etc. which are somewhat specialized?

It's interesting, though.  Kenji has said on Twitter he uses high-gluten flour in his pizza doughs at home.  But he doesn't include it in his SE recipes.
2008 2018-03-30 18:57:03 Okay so i had to take my mom to get an oil filter change...it was at 9:30...i got a pedicure...car still not done...im at subway...its 11:56...

2011 2018-03-30 18:56:43 As do I. We just listen to the local news. Then show's or Fox.
2012 2018-03-30 18:56:42 @ThatGirlShaeXo  I really want to try the SigMagic Scrub Circle, but I see that it contains palm oil. Does it contribute to deforestation?

I'm trying not to get products (cosmetic or food) that have it because of those poor orangutans and trees. 
2013 2018-03-30 18:56:39 this hair oil i used kinda smells like cotton candy jsjdjd

2021 2018-03-30 18:55:26 Oil as incentive for continued war in Syria...what a novel idea
2022 2018-03-30 18:55:08 Agreed. As a person of faith, I wish these people would knock it off.

To be clear,  I believe healing is real but there is mystery in it. It is rare. And it is not prescriptive.

Faith healers are snake oil salesmen
2023 2018-03-30 18:55:05 Thank you bro. I’ll be waiting for my coconut oil shipment 
2024 2018-03-30 18:54:37 When you transport oil by rail it is essentially a mobile pipeline.
2025 2018-03-30 18:54:36 Well now you don’t need oil for your car.  And you can’t eat chicken. Solved two of your tweets today.
2026 2018-03-30 18:54:35 ... this public service announcement was brought to you by Big Oil Inc, doing our bit to make us richer.
2027 2018-03-30 18:54:24 Ooh. Roseanne treats her knee with using cbd or hemp oil. It would raise awareness for pain relief without opioids
2028 2018-03-30 18:54:17 I ran out of lotion so I brought the old coconut oil out and wow
2029 2018-03-30 18:54:13 I have an idea. Don’t come to California. Don’t eat our produce, use our oil or take the revenue California provides to compensate for all the southern red taker states.
2030 2018-03-30 18:54:03 Lol nobody told me the company cars needed oil changes and the one I just turned on is 15,000 miles over, I real life needs talk to my workers about that lol

2035 2018-03-30 18:53:46 #TeamButter It does add flavour and helps in browning. I would rather eat fewer baked goods than use canola oil.
2036 2018-03-30 18:53:28 I’m waiting for my car to get an oil change and there is this couple next to me giggling and laughing. It’s so cute

a little drop of oil can go a lon way to people life
2042 2018-03-30 18:52:38 Made a nice ham & cheese omelette with a lotta spice; Red pepper olive oil, some roasted herbs and garlic and smidgen of pepper. Came out real good and I feel nice about myself.
2043 2018-03-30 18:52:36 No idea. But I find the best approach when deep frying is to use a very small saucepan, cook in small batches, and look at the price label on the bottle of oil - can you really not afford £1.50 (or whatever) to make that fabulous dish?
2044 2018-03-30 18:51:42 Yet another EU mandarin bought off by Salafist oil money, the mental gymnastics they spout to glorify islam is utterly nausiating 
2045 2018-03-30 18:51:29 So I’ve been using castor oil on my brows and lashes and now I feel like I belong where the wild things are.
2046 2018-03-30 18:51:25 Not on this occasion. Gamma and neck oil..
2047 2018-03-30 18:51:25 Welp my warranty is over for my oil changes for the dealership no more free ones so I won’t be going back there lol

2050 2018-03-30 18:51:13 if i were on the board i would want to get ahead of this story and carefully think through a well worded statement that didnt creep so many people out and taht understood the fears. That way the company would not become the Standard Oil octopus of 2018 @RonColeman
2051 2018-03-30 18:51:13 Actually, becoming a superpower had a lot to do with the discovery of oil in the Appalachians and Gulf coast..had that not been the case, America wouldn't be a superpower. So mostly it was luck
2052 2018-03-30 18:51:07 Switch to BECU! Big banks give money to oil companies & the suck
2053 2018-03-30 18:51:03 damn I'm at a Cadillac dealership getting my oil changed...and they're playing 60 minutes propaganda on the white helmets

2057 2018-03-30 18:50:23 Michelle, without sounding like I am shouting at you ( I am not), but NONE OF US WILL REST IN PEACE UNTIL THIS STOPS! We are still being publicly lynched, with NO consequences for the murderers. But they will send us to die for their oil and diamonds. We die for their sport.
2058 2018-03-30 18:50:16 Bronze green. Moving to a different tug next month. Fed up on here as gas has been quiet. Going on one that does oil tankers!
2059 2018-03-30 18:49:22 So I used a yummy body scrub again because ayokong tanggapin na allergic talaga ako. Success!!! The key is to be gentle sa application. Like a lotion or massage oil.
2060 2018-03-30 18:49:11 Yes but he was the CEO of an oil conglomerate and I was the valet letting him out of his limo to go to a meeting of the board of directors, where they announced that they were seizing control of the company he had built from the ground up for 50 years. Quite a sad story.
2061 2018-03-30 18:48:59 @SethKush @TheJohnSenning dont use baby oil as lube! Not good for internal use
2062 2018-03-30 18:48:59 I got the acne dote deep pore wash, Grapeseed oil for moisturizing, Mario Badescu toner spray (the green aloe one), and the Indian Clay face mask + apple cider vinegar (I haven't tried it yet but I'm going to tonight! It's suppose to be a really powerful face mask)
2063 2018-03-30 18:48:51 @WWERomanReigns For good health improve and to heal your wounds quickly: Take a glass warm milk with higher fat content and add 1 tablespoon Haldi and 2 tablespoon almond oil, 2-3 hours before you are going to sleep and after dinner ! 1 hour before breakfast on empty stomach
2064 2018-03-30 18:48:43 I feel like out of all the oil countries in the world, Canada (maybe Norway too) has the best chance to extract oil the greenest possible. No one else will give a shit. USA won't with the republicans at the helm
2065 2018-03-30 18:48:38 Fantastic! But that’s not the question, just as who’s paying protester’s bus fair to get to the Lake City Sky Train station. Who paid for Jack Poole Plaza? Who’s doing for Big Oil what Vivian Krause says American interests are doing here in Canada? #bcpoli #cdnpoli #hypocrisy
2066 2018-03-30 18:48:26 I'm reexamining this recipe and it's super doable. I bet that weed olive oil's easy to make at home.
2067 2018-03-30 18:48:22 I love it when millionaires dispense beauty advice. Hmmm, let’s talk about privilege, shall we? Um, nope, I don’t have several hundred dollars to drop on some snake oil skin potion. Thanks for asking though.
2068 2018-03-30 18:48:19 They’re both right David. While you’re there, do you fancy asking John Woodcock (Lab, Barrow) about the money he received from a Turkish oil company selling oil to ISIS?
2069 2018-03-30 18:48:12 Smell the coconut oil 
2070 2018-03-30 18:48:03 I am trying to build muscle and beat others to the rim, so figure I should get those carbs, but.. maybe it'd be better to just get coconut oil+green tea phytosomes? or both?
2071 2018-03-30 18:48:01 Fred Koch built a oil refinery in Germany for Hitler. Hitler wasn't able to fly their war planes until this was done and it gave Hitler the ability to bomb innocent people. The Koch brothers were raised by a Nazi nanny. 1/2

2076 2018-03-30 18:47:25 @bbcfood unwrapped - all very jolly but still don’t know the difference between coconut oil, water and milk.

2084 2018-03-30 18:46:43 I did remember - until all of this ridiculous noise successfully distracted me from the few shining points of hope and true American Character that this tragedy brought to light. I'm embarrassed, and I should be. Thanks for the reminder.
2085 2018-03-30 18:46:36 ... of course you don’t want a goalie to get injured, so no one actively hopes for it during the game, but I can remember seeing some *very* nervous/giddy Golden Bears/Oil Kings goalies on the bench over the years it’s such a great story!
2086 2018-03-30 18:46:34 If you are ever in a pinch again, those Oil Can Henry's have all been more than acceptable. You stay in your car, they show you everything they're doing. Basic oil change, tire check, fluid refill, etc is $40. They didn't upsell us at all.
2087 2018-03-30 18:46:23 Been using CBD oil on the psoriasis on my hand for a few days now, it's definitely helping more than the creams the drs have given me. No longer painful to open and close that hand so that's a plus.ill keep giving updates on how it works over a longer time frame.
2088 2018-03-30 18:46:21 As long as US coastlines are in danger of oil spills from offshore drilling and sonic testing is on the board, the EPA has plenty of work on the table.
2089 2018-03-30 18:45:59 In 2014 , Modi was unable to get anything through because of lack of majority in Rajya Sabha and the constraints  that a federal polity imposes of the Central Govt. Then he started using PSUs to beat these constraints..PMJDY(PSBs),

2093 2018-03-30 18:45:43 The downfall of owning a BMW is I just paid 80 bucks for an oil change and thought it was a steal.
2094 2018-03-30 18:45:35 Point of correction sir, PDP should tell Nigerians what they did with all the money they got when oil sold more 100 dollars for 16 years. If they had rule well, we will not be having bad roads, poor electricity supply, inadequate health facilities.
2095 2018-03-30 18:45:26 My partner's soon-to-be-ex-flatmate would fry meat in an inch of oil, then leave the oil in the pan for a few days, reuse it, then throw it down the sink. Which clogged.

2115 2018-03-30 18:42:34 Their PR spin is already working its way into mainstream, all with no solid numbers. Is Microsoft  becoming the snake oil salesman of the video game industry?

Till every drop is gone
I'll pour my love on you

2121 2018-03-30 18:41:52 I've never understood why this debate always goes extreme. By substituting viable options that are relevant to the area, we can get off the reliance to fossils. They have us all by the shorties with oil reliance. No matter where we head, it has to be better than this.

2138 2018-03-30 18:39:51 It doesn't make sense to give farmers special regulations to remain competitive, while Amazon is storming around the country putting everyone out of business, retailers and shop keepers, and no one is doing anything about it. THEY need to be broken up like Standard Oil was.
2139 2018-03-30 18:39:40 Heid changing the subject I'm looking forward to the next move by SS and SDNPA on Markwells Wood. SDNPA have clearly attempted to bush wack #UKOG and I think they have made a serious mistake.
2140 2018-03-30 18:39:35 Per your request: “Prove me wrong”:
1) Your words “oil ... KILLS ....EVERYTHING in its path”
2) You are not dead
Therefore you are WRONG ...QED(math term).

If you ARE dead.. my condolences ...but you are now DEAD WRONG cause I’m not dead and I have been in oil’s path.
2141 2018-03-30 18:39:28 Remember when I used to say KEEP THE OIL as a civilian?

2145 2018-03-30 18:39:16 Don’t feel too guilty. You at least have your delicious UK chocolate, unlike the mini-eggs here which are just HFC and palm oil...  and yet somehow still tasty...
2146 2018-03-30 18:39:09 The anti-narrative does even less to negate their heroism. I'd be surprised if you would have the courage to walk up on a backfiring car, let alone a forward firing weapon.

2154 2018-03-30 18:37:52 there just isn't that many people in the 1% and the rest know the real value of an extra $50 a month; dinner for family of 4 at McDonalds, a new shirt or an oil change.  It's nice to have, but not that big a deal? and not worth what it will ultimately cost to repay as debt.
2155 2018-03-30 18:37:46 Lol, I think each housemates are searching for their name tags or so
Is that black thing engine oil or what?
2156 2018-03-30 18:37:35 Obviously none of the politicians have done anything about it. If it's not brought up over and over again nothing will ever get done. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
2157 2018-03-30 18:37:33 Okla. needs to take those Oil & Gas subsidies and pay their teachers a living wage with those taxpayer dollars instead.
2158 2018-03-30 18:37:10 I never used castor oil by itself... so wouldn’t know what the best brands are. I do use Cactus oil from the brand ‘Mango and Lime’... i love it!!!

2162 2018-03-30 18:37:03 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2163 2018-03-30 18:37:02 getting my oil change is such a chore.

2165 2018-03-30 18:36:51 I always choose the glass version in any product where it's available. I even buy more expensive olive oil to do so. My Marmite comes in glass. Traditional!
2166 2018-03-30 18:36:44 Before I had a career change from oil industry to teaching we ran a second hand book business. Hundreds of our books have been given to charity over the years but still the beams groan with the weight of books. Getting back into selling now.

2173 2018-03-30 18:35:37 Yes. So let's diversify and make it so other companies may come and work with is instead of relying on big oil corporations?
2174 2018-03-30 18:35:32 You are subestimating the goals and objectives of the political Islam. And the expression "their oil" is an example of that. Do you think it is oil the reason for all these clashes? You have to study more about the Islam and its history.

2179 2018-03-30 18:35:00 The taste is fine but the texture is awful and leaves a weird film on the roof of the mouth.  It’s from some kind of weird oil in it so it won’t melt and it’s NASTY
2180 2018-03-30 18:34:54 1 glass bottle, containing oil, value 2s. 6d., and 6 other glass bottles, containing smelling-salts. Transported for Seven Years
2181 2018-03-30 18:34:38 Why pander to the oil lobby? The global market for autos has moved on to renewable fuel vehicles. Great strategy for being competitive on the global market.
2182 2018-03-30 18:34:33 Whats happening to all that oil and gas money being pulled out of the ground in Oklahoma? The State sufferers while the oil and gas industry prospers.
2183 2018-03-30 18:34:28 And the other oil producing countries care about matching any carbon goals? They will just ramp up production to match the global need. Frack North Dakota frack!

Your Buhari met $30B in the treasury. It wasn’t EMPTY! 

(Obasanjo met only $3B and oil price was < $10/barrel - he wasn’t crying)
2192 2018-03-30 18:33:25 Don't use Proactiv. That stuff dries out the skin which then overreacts and makes more oil which leads to more pimples

2199 2018-03-30 18:32:02 Try using Neutrogena’s shower soaps and oil. That’s how I got rid of mine.
2200 2018-03-30 18:32:01 Ahh & i have dry skin! But yeah fenty is definitely not full coverage. You should try out mac’s oil control lotion I’ve heard it’s really good for those with oily skin (-:
2201 2018-03-30 18:32:00 The British governments' interests in Nigeria are commercial and in the South (oil, mainly). They have left the North and the Hausa and Fulani to their fates, as almost everyone else has done.

2217 2018-03-30 18:29:31 Pruitt (Trump, Zinke) push gas oil & coal agendas. Tried to reverse controls on methane leaks (emissions). Methane many times more dangerous pollutant than CO2. How stupid! Now, they are pushing back on the Automobile standards. Harmful. The Constitution says "general welfare."

Marner is great. I would love to have him on the oil. I think the leafs underutilize him and he would be awesome...
2236 2018-03-30 18:27:07 Agreed and playing w/ a McDavid or Draisiatl, he'll have more of an offensive upside. Also, let's not kid ourselves, they never expected him to fall to them on the draft floor & likely didn't know exactly what they were getting but were thrilled they got him.

2245 2018-03-30 18:26:10 Question for all my essential oil lovers near and far: If I hosted a gathering either via live video or in person, would you attend and drink wine with me and talk oils? If I did a live video, what would you like to see or what questions would you like answered? 
Speak your mind!
2246 2018-03-30 18:26:07 Good thought in theory - most people that climb that ladder will continue to mooch - look at it like this - if you drive your moms car you'll treat it poorly - but if you pay for your own car you'll take it for a cash wash, get your oil changed, and  perform yearly maintenance

2254 2018-03-30 18:25:35 I loved matrix and phyto shampoos and conditioners  but oh my days the moraccon oil set has my hair feelin for days
2255 2018-03-30 18:25:34 1) I spent quite a bit of time in Southeast Asia. Not just 2 years in VN during the war, but in Malaysia, Borneo, Thailand, Sumatra, etc working for Oil Co. I understand the "Asian mindset" more than many. What Trump is doing with China vis-a-vis NK is nothing short of (cont)
2256 2018-03-30 18:25:26 Hogg claims he is a child on one hand. Stepped into the fire but can't be burned? 
Age doesn't give you unquestionable moral authority
2257 2018-03-30 18:25:17 The oil and gas sector in Nigeria is one big scam... What some of us know will amaze Nigerians, maybe I'll drop just one later tonight.
2258 2018-03-30 18:25:06 Actually, I think proper British chips should be lower in fat - fries are mostly surface, so will have absorbed more oil. Unless you mean proper chips cooked in lard :)
2259 2018-03-30 18:24:56 here's my point: oil companies are bad and solar panels can be a good alternative to fossil fuels, but none of this is going to go anywhere unless we significantly cut down on our energy usage and we stop valuing economic growth over all else
2260 2018-03-30 18:24:35 I just ordered some oil to go with the butter.
2261 2018-03-30 18:24:31 I just put peppermint oil on and I forgot to wipe my hands off and I just rubbed my eyes and now I'm pretty sure my eye is gonna fall out.
2262 2018-03-30 18:24:31 @foodtechhacker Want to DM you but can’t. How is peanut oil re Omega 6?
2263 2018-03-30 18:24:27 I always go: Mortadella, prosciutto, bresola, salami, pepperoni, lettuce, toms, onions and pepperoncini. Oil and vinegar only.
2264 2018-03-30 18:24:15 Couldn't agree more. Head injury? Bummer! Make sure they all sign their organ donor cards. And start spreading the oil slicks.
2265 2018-03-30 18:24:14 Cannabis oil on the benefits of children with cancer! My cousin has it and we live in a state where he cannot use it! It's so sad!

2268 2018-03-30 18:23:43 I agree with you on this.... Saudi has seen what tourism did in Dubai, they are trying to shift from oil & break the walls of religion that has annihilated them from the world and are investing in tourism, hoping to shift the momentum away from a predominately oil economy.
2269 2018-03-30 18:23:42 The doctor prescribed 1200mg of fish oil to me, but I forget what it was for.  Seems like a lot. #SeniorMoment
2270 2018-03-30 18:23:41 Got some Jamaican castor oil & some face masks
2271 2018-03-30 18:23:39 CC is the perfect vehicle for those who believe in big gov and globalization because you can use the west’s relative affluence to play on guilt and use people ignorance and desire to do good and they can blame big oil big coal big ag and don’t have to blame themselves or big gov
2272 2018-03-30 18:23:29 Got my truck washed and waiting to get it back from an oil change! Been over due for about 4000 miles
2273 2018-03-30 18:23:27 New species of crab: has too many legs to count, looks golden delicious, shell is bright red, hisses and retreats into the Great Oil Spill when threatened
2274 2018-03-30 18:23:24 Just a little faded. Needs some oil or something to make it POP again.
2275 2018-03-30 18:23:21 How the WWII US Merchant Marine were denied veterans benefits even though 9300 of them were killed by torpedoes, kamikaze planes, POW camps, burning oil, killed by Japanese, sharks or froze in water. Vet status came 43 years later and now these men deserve HR 154 compensation.
2276 2018-03-30 18:23:20 This picture is enhanced with an "oil paint" image filter.
2277 2018-03-30 18:23:17 Got two gas stoves, one a flat one in case and one screws into canister. Half pint Optimus, gas barbecue, three wood barbecue lots of fuel.
Oh, two old oil lamps with new wicks in. 
Why? Not camped for nine years.
2278 2018-03-30 18:23:14 @saimanisbet
2279 2018-03-30 18:23:09 I really spent 50$ just for a oil change in Asheville like wtf is the oil made of up here Gold 
2280 2018-03-30 18:23:06 Yeah, I remember people saying that a lot when internal memos were leaked from oil companies.
2281 2018-03-30 18:23:06 John D Rockefella (Oil) Christian 

None of these men comes close to what he was worth.
2282 2018-03-30 18:23:02 One word....cod liver oil. It's a winner! Oh, and glucosamine sulphate (preferably with added chrodroitin), they're both dead cheap from supermarkets. Has made my joints feel 20yrs younger!
2283 2018-03-30 18:22:57 Amendment for medical marijuana failed to make it in to a bill this  week in Topeka dealing with CBD oil #MedicalMarijuana
2284 2018-03-30 18:22:29 Beauty Tip: To fake clear skin when you notice a pimple, Apply tea tree oil as soon as you spot. 
2285 2018-03-30 18:22:27 Idk what toner is lol but yeah after I washed it out yeah but then I keep the olive oil leave in conditioner and hair cream
2286 2018-03-30 18:22:24 This is old news! SoftBank and Saudi Arabia just announced the worlds biggest grid scale solar system. Once completed it will produce 3 times more energy than the existing coal/oil/gas power plants combined.
2287 2018-03-30 18:22:23 not another curry takeaway...everyone is having a curry.
making me fancy one..
2288 2018-03-30 18:22:22 There is a Murphy’s law. The oil is suppose to own yyc. Yvr. They should just learn to roll over and play dead to the oilers. Now my first team. The stars. They can’t find a answer for the oil. But should murder the shamed and the nuckleheads.
2289 2018-03-30 18:22:21 Maybe its the beard oil 
2290 2018-03-30 18:22:08 It's part of being a Leftist. The future is always brighter if you trade in freedom & liberty today. Then the hammer & sickle drop. Too late then. See Oil rich Venezuela

2294 2018-03-30 18:21:53 Do I know anyone who uses CBD oil regularly??
2295 2018-03-30 18:21:51 Did this guy just learn how to do hahahahahah #chillax
2296 2018-03-30 18:21:48 Could just be that the oil cap is loose... We had this problem with our Kia van. The oil cap was loose, dirt got in the oil, the oil pump fouled up, and then our engine went bye-bye.
2297 2018-03-30 18:21:47 Does the government not have an interest in improving quality, and reducing our dependence on foreign oil? Or should only oil and other fossil fuels receive taxpayer subsidies?
2298 2018-03-30 18:21:30 Lol. Well I live in a gas and oil town. Obama made it a GHOST town with his regs. So no, he plunged us deeper during his admin., but hey those costal cities did great eh?
2299 2018-03-30 18:21:23 I have a Naga Lamb Curry and keema rice on order :)
2300 2018-03-30 18:21:15 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2301 2018-03-30 18:21:14 Brussels sprouts. Toss em in salt, pepper, and oil. Throw em in the oven for like, an hour
2302 2018-03-30 18:21:14 I got the oil changes dude looking at my engine

2308 2018-03-30 18:20:39 Oklahoma water table is about as bad thanks to EPA head selling out Oklahomans water for oil...lmao
2309 2018-03-30 18:20:33 I never have known love but as a kiss
In the mid battle, and a difficult truce
Of oil and water, candles and dark night,
Hillside and hollow
2310 2018-03-30 18:20:15 Mine broke during a oil change, yours ?
2311 2018-03-30 18:20:14 Taylor 70 | Buhari 75 
Taylor Dictator | Buhari Dictator 
Taylor Diamond rich country | Buhari Oil rich country 
Taylor Man | Buhari Man 
What are we saying? 
Not that i think she has an affair with Buhari; but just saying impossible is not a word.
2312 2018-03-30 18:20:13 Do some research as to what happened to the Caliphate 
3% is more than 1.8% (BTW Obama said could never be achieved again)
Dodge,Foxconn, Ford, Apple, etc
We now can produce ALL the oil we consume thanks to deregulation 
Tax cuts go to 2025
2313 2018-03-30 18:20:08 Nana Ama McBrown she points at Lil Win's dick and goes like "wo nika no engine wo mu? He nods yes and she goes like "Filli tank no na changey oil, meeba" what does that even mean?
2314 2018-03-30 18:20:05 Charles and David Koch, the oil billionaires who are behind the conservative tea party movemen
2315 2018-03-30 18:20:00 Trump undoing fuel efficiency regs and targets, because he benefits fron oil sales! And don't care for environment! Car makers exchange deal in wake of metal tarrifs.
2316 2018-03-30 18:19:50 Or top the boiled peanuts with the chili oil stuff. omg.
2317 2018-03-30 18:19:31 Could this be a reason we did not see a dramatic drop in housing prices in Alberta when oil tanked and recession followed?
2318 2018-03-30 18:19:18 I’ve taken cannabis oil for over a week now and it’s changed my life. Wish I had known about it years ago.
2319 2018-03-30 18:19:06 [pouring olive oil into the pan]

2321 2018-03-30 18:18:45 I guess that’s why he gave midland oil
2322 2018-03-30 18:18:42 BS renewables are at this time , inefficient and waste of tax $. Demand for oil is at an all time high   Oil and gas is and will be for a long time huge for Canadians economy. Canada is suffering now look at economic conditions federally and provincially.
2323 2018-03-30 18:18:40 Next mission, find out if any place down here does a decent Italian. Extra oil and vinegar.

2329 2018-03-30 18:17:34 Pipelines help make oil cheap.

2339 2018-03-30 18:15:26 Bye the way you will not escape the cost of "The Environment" by Brexit it will most certainly become worse without the relief provided by oil, gas, coal Design build No Rescue Groups and possibly little Reservoir Water Pipeline. Digging trains out of snow drift with coal shovels
2340 2018-03-30 18:15:24 Oh yeah. Last year solar panels $300. For electricity bill all year. I have oil no gas so everything  is elec. Don't produce enough to carry Jan-March. Usually it can be over $100 a month.
2341 2018-03-30 18:14:50 Laying naked covered in coconut oil while the window slightly open w/ a breeze coming through is the best!

2343 2018-03-30 18:14:46 EIA Jan monthly crude movement between PADDs data show that PD2-PD3 +1MM mom. PD3-PD2 movements -8MM mom.  Lower receipts from PD3 added to PD2 draws & PD3 builds. #OOTT #EIAreport #oil
2344 2018-03-30 18:14:46 OMGoodness! I started using rosehip oil about 3months ago and now I SWEAR by it! I use ‘The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold‑Pressed Rosehip Oil’ I LOVE IT! Plus it’s cruelty-free & vegan, if that’s your thing (I don’t work for them, promise!)
2345 2018-03-30 18:14:40 That’s why too extra. Cut them in half, put them in a bowl: add melted butter or olive oil or bacon fat, season w/ a little pepper, put them on a baking pan into the oven at 375 for about 35 minutes. Didn’t try them til I was adult, they’re good.
2346 2018-03-30 18:14:37 Dollarization would also eventually lead to deflation. Venezuela might as well hand over ownership of its oil reserves to US corporations.
2347 2018-03-30 18:14:26 @ScottPruittOK @SecondLady @FLOTUS @vp @realDonaldTrump
Just because Scott Pruitt doesnt care about the air our children breathe 
Doesnt mean the Rest of the World Agrees with him & we insist that oil refineries keep the doing everything they can to keep our environment safe
2348 2018-03-30 18:14:19 Simmer honeydew and chives. Top off with a bit of olive oil.
2349 2018-03-30 18:14:14 OIL FOR FEET PICS LOLOLOLOL
2350 2018-03-30 18:14:04 The drug test the use don't even show  its THC in your system it shows a lack of metabolites. It doesn't show level of impairment. And anybody that works in the oil industry knows cocaine is the big problem  because it leaves your system fast enough to pass a drug test
2351 2018-03-30 18:13:50 The way I’m craving a holiday now is unreal. I need to be on a sunny beach drenched in coconut oil right now
2352 2018-03-30 18:13:43 2011, a good year..like q2 2018 will be the start of a good year for the Gatwick Gusher and all partners and their share holders in HHDL.
2353 2018-03-30 18:13:36 1) this never happened, 2) oil futures would forecast this and adjust accordingly, 3) the lack of gas buying that day would counter itself out in the days before/after, it's not like we'll never not need gas. I hate dumb peiple

2358 2018-03-30 18:13:04 Jubilee happened with Yuan oil futures commencing. We just haven't seen the consequences .. yet .. like we did when other countries tried to sell oil for currencies other than dollars .. Iraq (recall what happened to Saddam) .. Libya (recall what happened to Gaddafi)
2359 2018-03-30 18:12:55 Not heard of it. Does it involve 1 time cash infusions from selling public services 2 balance budget in short term? Or overreliance on oil and gas 4 govt revenue? Or giving away $1b in Ralph Bucks at expense of infrastructure? Or driving educated professionals out of AB? #abpoli
2360 2018-03-30 18:12:52 The positive is, he is reliable indicator. Take opposite position and you'll be making right choice.
2361 2018-03-30 18:12:39 Mechanics really the top salesman, you will bring your vehicle in for a $20 oil change now all of a sudden you need a new transmission 
2362 2018-03-30 18:12:33 How is it genocide when Islam or muslims do not even belong in india. It's a Arabic desert cult started by warlord propagated through oil money to control lives of poor people.

2366 2018-03-30 18:11:46 Heh :) No, not oil. I've never learned to paint in oils, but the digital image was the same emotional impact.
2367 2018-03-30 18:11:35 Start hoarding coal oil now, there won’t be an indictment. The cops will claim poor training, obvious since they missed that many times at close range. This is textbook state sanctioned slaughter of an unarmed black man. Back in the beat in 6 months.
2368 2018-03-30 18:11:32 Actor? He’s speaking his truth.
2369 2018-03-30 18:11:20 As long as your oil is topped up you'll be grand. As you say, time enough to sort an oil & filter change next week. Enjoy!
2370 2018-03-30 18:11:19 My Subaru got its first oil change today and I got a free hand wash! My baby looks beautiful

2372 2018-03-30 18:11:06 I'm diagnosed PTSD and bipolar disorder and I can't get a job that I'm more than qualified for simply cuz I'll have marijuana in my system it's complete discrimination that gets overlooked by or governments because it's oil companies that are doing it and we enjoy  the revenues.

2375 2018-03-30 18:11:01 2 packed cups of mint leaves, 3 medium cloves garlic, teaspoon lemon juice half T of lemon zest, little olive oil and 1/4 cup feta cheese emulsified together for the pesto.
2376 2018-03-30 18:10:45 they're going to lose regardless, there's a finite amount of oil. if that's your sole goal, you can just like... wait

2378 2018-03-30 18:10:22 My Sister and I just had to use almost a whole role of paper towel to clean up half a cup of vegetable oil that spilled on the floor. After we wiped it up applied dish soap directly to the floor and after we rubbed that in everywhere then water. I think no one will die on it now.
2379 2018-03-30 18:10:22 …ぐぅ
2380 2018-03-30 18:10:21 Go to get an oil change and end up spending $500 in repairs like bro I hate car maintenance

2396 2018-03-30 18:09:03 you enjoy Adrian...looks rather nice.
2397 2018-03-30 18:09:02 I use meal, unless I’ve run out, but most important is using chicken fat instead of (bleah) vegetable oil. And really strong broth.
2398 2018-03-30 18:08:50 Thank you chemicals that we put in our bodies whether by prescription medications or in our diets cause all these diseases look into dr Goldhamer I’m just trying to help save you from this debilitating disease. Cbd oil has totally saved and changed my life .
2399 2018-03-30 18:08:39 a well maintained beard. if you don't have a skincare routine you prolly don't condition/oil your beard AND you prolly don't exfoliate the skin under.

2405 2018-03-30 18:07:27 Big oil must have made this headline, because the majority of recalls on Tesla’s are with sensors. Tesla doesn’t take the cars back, they just replace the sensor.
2406 2018-03-30 18:07:22 Maybe we shouldn’t be relying on oil which fluctuates a lot and agriculture that depends on the weather for our main source as tax revenue.
2407 2018-03-30 18:07:19 You honestly just coat them with Cajun seasoning and olive oil then bake them
2408 2018-03-30 18:06:57 That's b/c they're comparing him to Matthews and Laine and he's not that kind of player and never will be. However, I do expect him to be a better all-around player than both of those guys but nowhere near the offensive threat.
2409 2018-03-30 18:06:56 Wish Stephen Sanderson took to twitter for a chat. Good on you David.
2410 2018-03-30 18:06:49 I started taking cbd oil drops and wow i feel amazing now
2411 2018-03-30 18:06:31 i luv their toner and the rich moist soothing cream, their oil cleanser is good too!! i didn’t like the sunscreen cuz it gave me too much of a white cast and made me oily also mine smells like cheese now .

2414 2018-03-30 18:06:00 I mean it probably does, up to a point. It sounds like you're not having full blown break outs, just a few complications here and there. It might be working a tiny bit, but falling short in some areas. Personally I never use coconut oil unless my skin is in DIRE NEED of moisture.
2415 2018-03-30 18:05:50 Just bought the @LauraMercier tinted oil free moisturiser! Been wanting it for ages!!

2419 2018-03-30 18:04:40 Oil your ropes everybody!
There’s nothing like a rope fully conditioned with a dozen or more light coats of jojoba (or mineral) oil to prevent it from chewing your hands up in the 1st place.

90% of my students are tying with really dry rope. Conditioning is a continual process.
2420 2018-03-30 18:04:35 That's as maybe. And its tragic how those areas have been betrayed by Westminster. The answer is to be more involved with politics. Don't take our eyes off the ball. Not to vote in inept, lying, snake oil salesmen.
2421 2018-03-30 18:04:17 So I sold my truck to my dad and he gave me his but he didn’t tell me it was like 4,000 miles over for an oil change
2422 2018-03-30 18:03:33 Ha! My mom gave me a recipe like that. Thought about it and realized it’s egg and oil, mostly. Typical ingredients
2423 2018-03-30 18:03:06 rosehip oil helps with scars and stretch marks. its not something that works overnight, you need to be consistent :)
2424 2018-03-30 18:02:51 I hate getting my oil changed or anything having to do with cars bc then I have to deal with trick ass men patronizing me and trying to take advantage of me
2425 2018-03-30 18:02:50 Haven't seen much high-oleic sunflower oil here yet. This one is 63% polyunsaturated, which is probably mostly linoleic acid.
2426 2018-03-30 18:02:46 Roasted with olive oil, pancetta, salt & pepper

2430 2018-03-30 18:02:00 Oil demand is booming 

The only winner of blocking Canadian pipelines is other oil producing countries. 

That is who @Tzeporah and @MikeHudema really work for.

2435 2018-03-30 18:01:26 I do like US oil & especially nat gas in the next 5-10yr horizon especially 'secondary effect' beneficiaries.
2436 2018-03-30 18:01:16 เลิศศศ
2437 2018-03-30 18:01:06 Been at the dealership since 12:30. I just came to get my oil changed moe
2438 2018-03-30 18:01:06 Yeah, thanks
Ended up using olive oil, dish soap, and hand lotion...
2439 2018-03-30 18:00:43 Started putting a tablespoon of MCT oil in my coffee. I can feel it sparking things in my brain like it's telling me that I haven't been giving it the right fats in awhile.
2440 2018-03-30 18:00:38 Can I get an oil change minus the weird dudes
2441 2018-03-30 18:00:37 Shortage ? I thought they made less because the price for oil was getting low again ?
2442 2018-03-30 18:00:18 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2443 2018-03-30 18:00:11 Ah! But was it Waitrose Deluxe Organic Coconut Oil?

2445 2018-03-30 18:00:09 have u tried coconut oil ~*~*~*
2446 2018-03-30 18:00:01 Is anybody besides me still boycotting Exxon (and now Mobil) for the Valdez oil spill? I haven't spent a penny on their gas since 1989.
They spent billions on lawyers to avoid doing the right thing.
2447 2018-03-30 17:59:57 Haha should of put olive oil on,it blocks the sun apparently
2448 2018-03-30 17:59:49 Why did I start craving bread and oil and vinegar?
2449 2018-03-30 17:59:38 I’m gonna try do my a3 oil painting of kazuharu in the holidays bc I’ve got new higher quality paints and lots of time!!
2450 2018-03-30 17:59:37 Never act against the narrative
2451 2018-03-30 17:59:37 Disagree. A little olive oil and salt is yummy. You can get fancy with a squirt of lemon and add some crunch of pecans or macadamia nuts. They are a staple over here. 
2452 2018-03-30 17:59:24 In the US, sunflower oil is mostly high-oleic, which is fairly low in LA.
2453 2018-03-30 17:59:13 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. Thanks - Mark 3/3
2454 2018-03-30 17:59:10 I have some friends that could help set this up. PM for exclusive essential oil deals
2455 2018-03-30 17:58:59 But I think having to pay 70$ for an oil change it the dumbest thing ever.
2456 2018-03-30 17:58:57 "A snake at my disposal" Does she think this thing is a decoration! That snake is suffering! "He was painted with tar and oil" like people were going to be dumb enough to paint their snakes with her!
2457 2018-03-30 17:58:50 I'm expecting the CPC will win the federal election and reopen the oil sands. Imagine Canada making money again? A crazy thought but I'm down with it... So is my family.
2458 2018-03-30 17:58:29 The Russain economy will fall apart with a collapse of oil prices. Trump is trying to prevent this by leaving climate pact, turning the EPA over to a climate denier and moves like this one to continue the consumption of gasoline. There is no logic to this.
2459 2018-03-30 17:58:24 Gail is a warrior but she doesn't go far enough.  If you even look at a moccasin, or step on soil once belonging to Native Peoples, you'll need to buy my White Christian's Anti-Colonized Peoples Anointing Oil (WCACPAO) for only $295/ounce.  No other oil works.
2460 2018-03-30 17:58:03 Take 5 Oil Change should be called Take 45 cause dang that’s how long I’ve been waiting.
2461 2018-03-30 17:58:02 Tests from 15yrs ago proved to help depression & appetite with hidden THC. Gooey oil is curing & treating epilepsy ,Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cancer, mood enhanced dementia for will to live.
2462 2018-03-30 17:58:01 Entrench your body in argan oil then go stand in the thunderstorm. Good for improving your ability to recall memories.
2463 2018-03-30 17:57:53 Omg have you? Bless you! It’s horrific I think it’s from products/oil. Thank you hun I’ll go back to the doctors and ask about that. Xx
2464 2018-03-30 17:57:43 Snake oil
2465 2018-03-30 17:57:41 The less dependent US is on Nigerian crude oil imports, the less interest it has in the Niger Delta.

In similar fashion, the less dependent US is on Middle East crude imports, the less interest they have in the Arab Israeli peace process.
2466 2018-03-30 17:57:38 Why tf barbers put oil on my head then brush it!!!..like bruh WTF IS U BRUSHING ITS NOTHING THERE!!!!!...THATS SHIT HURTS
2467 2018-03-30 17:57:32 Beautiful Cutting Boards by @nakamurawoodworking Using Howard Cutting Board Oil 
2468 2018-03-30 17:57:29 I went to get an oil change and my head started pounding
2469 2018-03-30 17:56:44 I have my doubts. It's amazing work nonetheless, but I honestly am having trouble believing this bear exact reference isn't just an oil paint effect done in PS. It's exactly the same...just...how? 

I'll have to go watch their VoD on Twitch. To be sure.
2470 2018-03-30 17:56:38 This oil change price ridiculous this some bs lol
2471 2018-03-30 17:56:34 Oh crap yeah my mates live round corner to you and they are Oil two.  Get all your cats and dogs to sit on you lol
2472 2018-03-30 17:56:21 Yup - avoid coconut oil and olive oil as they're too heavy and block your pores, but jojoba should basically resemble the natural oils your face produces. Wishing you clear skin! 
2473 2018-03-30 17:56:06 in which case both sectors contribute robustly to our countries economy. Oil/gas being the larger of the two. We can also see that the heavy oil differential is causing Canada to lose $10B+ annually in value. Not insignificant relative to the size of BC's tourism industry (3)
2474 2018-03-30 17:56:05 So you aren’t really interested in the truth then...

I could be persuaded that the earth was flat with compelling enough evidence.  All I’ve seen are snake oil salesmen and those that have fallen for them...
2475 2018-03-30 17:55:42 You boil it first then put mix veggies, you add cooking oil n you fry it
2476 2018-03-30 17:55:42 Yo my mum just bought me some serious beard oil
2477 2018-03-30 17:55:28 Wake up Kentucky  and realize that your voting preference has consequences.       
Clean water, EPA protections and #MAGA  mix as well as oil and water !
2478 2018-03-30 17:55:26 First Nations dissent in Canada by Vivian Krause. Ellis Ross is a leading BC voice of this issue. Regarding the GDP impacts of oil/gas and tourism. I understand why referencing BC stats is relevant to you.
However I would argue as a national project we need to look nationally (2)
2479 2018-03-30 17:55:20 So everybody just decided as a group to get an oil change on a Friday? Oh.
2480 2018-03-30 17:55:19 virgin coconut oil kamo
2481 2018-03-30 17:55:16 Yes!!!! I roast them with olive oil, s & p, garlic and bacon! A pinch of sugar cuts any bitterness in the sprouts!
2482 2018-03-30 17:54:56 I might go to BBW and ask for celery fried with the damn beef oil too fuck vegans 
2483 2018-03-30 17:54:46 US oil demand at 20.461mbpd in Jan18, up 1.217mbpd or 6.3% y/y -EIA #oott
2484 2018-03-30 17:54:45 Thanks babe. I’m on oil. I’ve got a guy coming in the morning. Until then I am wearing 5 layers and walking round in a coat 
2485 2018-03-30 17:54:38 I use oil but ive been trying to get this balm dre speaks of for a while now
2486 2018-03-30 17:54:26 everything is so technical, and no one looks at the obvious. I have an electric car the warning lights came on,they said I needed to replace the battery. Replaced battery still warning lights came on. Mechanic checked couldn’t find the problem. filled it with oil, problem solved
2487 2018-03-30 17:54:15 I would argue that the high price of oil devastated Alberta
2488 2018-03-30 17:54:11 as long as you don’t use your finger it’s okay because you’re not adding oil to the graphite
not my cup of tea personally but it’s waaaay better that using your finger
2489 2018-03-30 17:53:57 Like one time I got my whole inspection done for free along with reduced price for my oil change
2490 2018-03-30 17:53:57 Money is good bit oil well is better, she wants to receive some by faith
2491 2018-03-30 17:53:51 … why are they greasy… why are you cooking them in oil??
2492 2018-03-30 17:53:46 Then this lady decides “let me put this loud ass lavender plant oil in this diffuser” bitch we do NOT have any to smell that. It’s strong af
2493 2018-03-30 17:53:21 @Valvoline STOP PUTTING YOUR OIL FILTERS ON SO TIGHT! I HAVE TO BREAK IT OFF EVERY TIME I COME ACROSS ONE!
2494 2018-03-30 17:53:15 Just got my shipment of Zilis CBD oil and ready for shipment.  Who needs some let me know.  Legal in all 50 states and has 0.0% THC!
2495 2018-03-30 17:53:13 can anyone spare a couple drops of lavender essential oil?
2496 2018-03-30 17:53:11 I just fixed a creaky hinge with coconut oil if you want to know what level of middle-class wanker I’ve achieved 
2497 2018-03-30 17:53:08 1500 for dealer oil change seems appropriate... for a sultan
2498 2018-03-30 17:53:03 i bought 2kg of coconut oil when i was sad and now, months later, the still half-full jar smells like a rotting corpse in my bathroom: a memoir
2499 2018-03-30 17:53:03 i love being ignored at the oil change place
2500 2018-03-30 17:52:52 i’m trying oil pulling but idk what i’m doing
2501 2018-03-30 17:52:51 having oily skin is the worst, i could deadass cause the biggest oil spill disaster to ever exist
2502 2018-03-30 17:52:38 Or olive oil or butter works also
2503 2018-03-30 17:52:19 Oh sick thanks. I was hoping to use something more natural like oils. Jojoba seems like it could help me. It's much lighter on the skin right? Unlike coconut oil?
2504 2018-03-30 17:52:15 For sure & god knows this organization has done it on numerous occasions in the past. I honestly think McLellan is happy w/ how Puljujarvi has come along but he's recognized what needs fixing & has to ensure the kid is ready to hit the ground running in a T6 role when 18-19 hits.

2507 2018-03-30 17:51:50 US oil production basically flat in Jan.  Increases in GoM & OK.  Note production decreased in both TX & NM.  Shale taking a breather or is production starting to show impact of takeaway constraints?
2508 2018-03-30 17:51:47 Unfortunately, plastic is made of oil and we all know who’s obsessed with oil (Trump)— which is why he reduced bears ears to a fraction of the protected area. #resist
2509 2018-03-30 17:51:47 mines a new one & fitting on a bike not built for it so is a learning progress. Sounds like you need yours looked at, might be worth draining the oil & see what it looks like.

2519 2018-03-30 17:50:51 Wanna bet this is because the corporatocracy has somehow got Ecuador by the cojones? Perhaps some under-the-table settlement to the lawsuits over Texaco/Chevron's oil spills and waste in its Amazon region? When in doubt… always follow the mammon.

2536 2018-03-30 17:48:21 Jojaba oil, sweet almond oil or rose oil are great substitutes as a moisturiser - I personally use rose because it suits my skin and makes me smell great but I think jojoba would probably be best for you (apparently it resembles your skin's natural sebum)
2537 2018-03-30 17:48:13 so we still have oil in an #EV 
2538 2018-03-30 17:48:12 I agree, GAAP accounting rules are tools of the big oil #cartel

2542 2018-03-30 17:47:34 There was an article in 2013 on MercuryNews that specifically targeted Bromine Vegetable Oil found in Gatorade. (Also other Coca-Cola drinks) which caused concern for many consumers as they linked it to Behavioral problems, and so it was removed. (ofc not so cut and dry mind you

2547 2018-03-30 17:46:59 As I said earlier, using your GM's prized free agent signing who is less than 2 seasons into a seven-year pact as a B6 guy is a good way to ensure you're unemployed when things don't go as planned. Oilers can ill-afford to have Lucic become a spare part this early in his deal.

2553 2018-03-30 17:46:01 And let’s not forget, get oil to a great price.

2595 2018-03-30 17:41:47 Those who dont buy electric from here on are the problem. We ourselves can put the oil out of business if we shift our demand. Simple really...
2596 2018-03-30 17:41:46 I don’t want to jinx it, but I didn’t have to put my cat down, I learned about a secret tots place, and NTB just replaced a gasket for free because the manager thought his guys should have caught it when I got my oil changed.
2597 2018-03-30 17:41:40 Oil rice? Finish? 
2598 2018-03-30 17:41:39 But "allowing" sale of our oil and gas isn't really proactively doing anything, because we were already doing that, no? I'd hardly call that an effort if that's the case.

2649 2018-03-30 17:35:12 Venezuela must not be allowed to exploit its massive oil reserves for the benefit of its people. That's a commie notion and totally unamerican.
2650 2018-03-30 17:35:10 Oil has its own inflation dynamic that occasionally spills over to the broader measures. The current dynamic is US fracking, which has had a deflationary impact on oil albeit in a growing US economy.

2657 2018-03-30 17:34:29 If oil has nothing to do with our governments then why does the dollar drop every time oil prices fluctuate? Could it have anything to do with O&G's massive contribution to the GDP? That gradual move away from oil is decades away.

2659 2018-03-30 17:34:00 It's partisan when GOP members of Congress adopt policies that they feel are well-intentioned, but actually have negative consequences. Headline examples: elephant trophies imported to U.S.; offshore oil drilling on Florida's coasts.

2664 2018-03-30 17:33:06 Such a funny joke that US is fighting ISIS. They are few thousands fighters from Asia and Europe and US the superpower had to destroy cities in Syria and kill hundreds if not thousands to get rid of them. Do not belittle our intelligence. It is oil, gas and the safety of Israel.
2665 2018-03-30 17:33:02 It may evolve and it is wait and see. but this was written because of the hysteria about how the new Chinese energy contract was going to kill the dollar as a means of pricing oil
2666 2018-03-30 17:32:58 Not one single person this administration has nominated for any office/job has been qualified!Look at his Cabinet, it is one enormous cluster!

2675 2018-03-30 17:31:11 Yeah, how much is ya oil polluting the environment...
To be fair x
2676 2018-03-30 17:31:09 I rubbed coconut oil on a different rat.

2677 2018-03-30 17:30:46 I like the sound of a chocolate olive oil cake! The 5.5km run is sadly far beyond my capabilities. Although I would fast walk 5.5km to get to the cake.
2678 2018-03-30 17:30:34 @MyDoncaster how do I dispose of waste cooking oil? Grey bin day AND. Blue bin day have refused it
2679 2018-03-30 17:30:33 They owe us money for all the oil refineries and oil platforms that were nationalized.  They stole from American companies and American companies want their shit back.
2680 2018-03-30 17:30:03 Even with all the regulations in place after Exxon Valdez for oil companies. Fines, lives and the environment really don’t affect the bottom line.
2681 2018-03-30 17:29:48 Ghee remains on the surface & dumbs down idlis..fit for a sacrificial repast, no more. Now re-imagine a hot fluffy idlly with a tiny spoonful of golden oil  making its glistening way into interstices. It  trembles on your tongue then slides in orgasmic delight down your throat.
2682 2018-03-30 17:29:42 Halafu pia ukiwa mechi uanze kuskia harufu ya oil hivi ama garage unajua tu huyo ni mdem mjaka
2683 2018-03-30 17:29:31 If America is not run by a bunch of f***ing crooks, how is it that we were doing so much oil drilling in Venezuela for decades and they owe us money? America is so crooked that there is no hope.
2684 2018-03-30 17:29:28 pay to play trickster...send this man packing..owned by big oil and gas. destroying our country & environment.
2685 2018-03-30 17:29:03 Please did we mention oil and mention those States or we talk about agriculture and focus on the states with comparative advantages. Why are you being led by a predetermined notion against Buhari as a person. Please present your third force let Nigerians decide.
2686 2018-03-30 17:29:01 I thought of that! I saw a fresh pasta shop near us - told dad on our way to the Coliseum we should buy and cook some with a simple olive oil & garlic. Great minds think alike!
2687 2018-03-30 17:28:57 俺が人と喋るのが苦手なのは単純に人見知りだからだと思ってたけどただ人見知りなだけではなくてまず話題提起がめちゃくちゃ苦手なのが一つと今まで経験した人間関係が誰かが出した話題に誰かが面白いこと言って全員でガハハと笑って終了の連続で構成されてるのでそもそも会話ができないってことっぽい
2688 2018-03-30 17:28:50 I cant wait!! I'm ordering the hibiscus oil too so I'll have 3 diff serums soon!!
2689 2018-03-30 17:28:36 And just how does cannabis oil get your pancreas to start producing insulin again?
2690 2018-03-30 17:28:06 Richly deserved

2693 2018-03-30 17:27:48 Okay, but Calgary had the same per capita income as San Francisco in the oil boom earlier this decade and it still matched SF's mode share.
2694 2018-03-30 17:27:43 Beard oil and conditioner 
2695 2018-03-30 17:27:25 In Trump’s America, racism is applauded and beer bellies are in vogue. In Trump’s America, education is seen as suspect and teeth are seen as unnecessary. In Trump’s America solar power is derided and more crotches smell of gun oil.
2696 2018-03-30 17:27:21 Been sitting in #NTB all day just for an oil change. Makes no sense
2697 2018-03-30 17:27:14 68 dead on police station fire in Carabobo state threaten widespread rioting.the beginning!!!

2701 2018-03-30 17:27:03 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

2703 2018-03-30 17:27:02 That a large can of neck oil or 330?
2704 2018-03-30 17:26:55 1) Fasting
2) chucked out canola oil ..only coco, ghee and kachi ghani mustard oil
3) chucked out all plastics
4) concious deep breathings
5) negligible processed sugar intake ..mostly jaggery
But still need to make switch to non processed salt
Thank you Luke
2705 2018-03-30 17:26:54 WRONG!  Obama was the first and sold millions of acres of public land alsoThe Obama administration has leased 2.5 times more land to oil and gas drilling than it has set aside for preservation and conservation. In 2011 alone, the BLM held three  largest lease to drill on US land
2706 2018-03-30 17:26:49 Not surprising that an oil/gas producer would come up with a story line that shows room for lots of oil/gas. But it's progress of sorts for Shell to aim for an overall path it deems economically feasible.  Next step: modify Shell's biz plans.
2707 2018-03-30 17:26:49 my advice it to wash your hair only 2 or 3 times a week so your natural oils feed your hair, don't use heat on it, and use an oil of your choosing on your ends and after you wash it 
2708 2018-03-30 17:26:44 How do you like to use Black Pepper Oil?

2710 2018-03-30 17:26:21 Turkey is cooking. One half breast, two legs, two wings. Charoset is done. (I toasted the nuts this year.)

Eggs are done and betzah is in the oven.

I decided to make knaidelach after all. I used a half recipe, and since I had some, schmaltz instead of oil. Mixture is resting.
2711 2018-03-30 17:26:05 Did a 5.5k run and made chocolate olive oil cake. #Winning at Good Friday

2713 2018-03-30 17:25:48 How is digital TV better?I am trying to watch over the air TV while getting my oil changed and it cuts out all the time.Old snowy was OK.
2714 2018-03-30 17:25:46 People really spend money for some damn canola oil to put in their beard to grow it. Lmao. Y’all are trippin.
2715 2018-03-30 17:25:45 Happy Birthday Jane!! I’m a fellow April baby as well. Thank you for e everything you have done to educate and helps as save the beautiful creatures of this world. If also been learning about Palm Oil and the negative impact it has on the Orangutans habitats.
2716 2018-03-30 17:25:45 @realDonaldTrump Russia is a threat to Western Europe with their gas and oil that can be cut off at a moments notice.  In the Winter , Western Europe is dependent on Russian Oil and gas for heating.  We should be building Natural gas tankers for export to Europe.
2717 2018-03-30 17:25:34 I've been to quite a few ramen places in toronto and Sansotei seems to be the best one so far. There Tonkotsu black ramen with garlic oil was so creamy and delicious.
2718 2018-03-30 17:25:25 I’ve Had The Roses From My Grandpa Jimenez’s Funeral For Years, Get My Oil Changed And Just Saw They Stepped On It

2720 2018-03-30 17:25:16 #outwithTrump Now our Environmental Protection Agency, driven by reckless #POTUS is about to scrap our pioneering fuel economy targets created to lessen our dependency on oil, and also confront very real climate change. What next Trump? Do you care about generations to come?

2722 2018-03-30 17:24:38 Anybody who thought they were actually going to see a benefit from the tax cut that’s middle class is sadly mistaken. Rising oil prices and interest rates will fuel inflation and there goes your benefit
2723 2018-03-30 17:24:27 toothpaste or oil on the burned area
2724 2018-03-30 17:24:22 If somebody opposes pipelines because of FN rights and oil tanker spills, those are things I know less about.  

If someone's opposition is rooted in a desire to combat climate change, they're choosing an extremely inefficient strategy.
2725 2018-03-30 17:24:20 Don't feed the trolls or oil the bots. *block*
2726 2018-03-30 17:24:19 Wow this is totally me  RT @Son_ImSleep: Dawg idc if my car is on fire bro I came here for an oil change, nothing else
2727 2018-03-30 17:24:17 I’m thankful to have men in my life that know cars, never been to a shop for an oil change
2728 2018-03-30 17:24:12 That would be great! Except, there are plenty of other oil lobbyists ready to take his place.
2729 2018-03-30 17:24:05 These boys in Atch don’t play around when it comes to oil changes. Less than 10 mins 
2730 2018-03-30 17:24:02 Anyone who had/has a mother who insists that oil of oregano is the answer to your respiratory illness... be thankful for her and this cringeworthy essential oil that is the secret to every one of your problems.
2731 2018-03-30 17:23:40 You might like them baked. 375 for about 30 minutes.  Drizzle extra virgin olive oil when done with a little garlic powder and salt and pepper.
2732 2018-03-30 17:23:30 The fact that almost everyone puts almond oil, almond flour or almond milk in everything kinda sucks.. Gotta read every damn label now..

2736 2018-03-30 17:23:13 why everybody wanna get an oil change on Good Friday
2737 2018-03-30 17:23:08 Honey sriracha brussel sprouts! Just salt peppa & olive oil works too though

2739 2018-03-30 17:22:14 Laid out in the back, slapped all this coconut oil on
2740 2018-03-30 17:22:11 The bigger ethical scandal is the fact that he is essentially an oil and gas lobbyist running the fucking EPA.
2741 2018-03-30 17:22:07 I fail to see a positive here.

If it is for low-end value added oils, then it is likely because it was below the grade required to sell directly as flower. There is enough demand.

Also, as an extractor, fresh product = quality, so all their oil will be lowest possible value.
2742 2018-03-30 17:21:57 The guys at oil change places who lick the sticker before they put it on ur car are fucking gross. 

That shit sticks on there without spit you idiot yeeyee ass mother fucker.

2755 2018-03-30 17:20:14 I don't want this to go off on a tangent, but I believe it's wrong of someone to say a subject is trivialized purely based on the medium it's presented in. It's a form of elitism. I can't imagine an oil painting or theatre play on the subject would be so easily dismissed.
2756 2018-03-30 17:20:08 Oil change make u feel like u gotta new whip
2757 2018-03-30 17:19:52 Keep me posted if it works :)

As with everything....it will take a few times but hopefully it'll work

For the olive oil...my best advice is massage it into your hair then leave it for a few hours (or better yet...overnight) so that the hair soaks the nutrients. Then shower.♡♡
2758 2018-03-30 17:19:49 North Sea Oil? Did I hear someone say "North Sea oil"?
2759 2018-03-30 17:19:44 It doesn't help when Todd throws him out in key spots.  I think even Lucic bashers were getting okay with letting him contribute on 3rd line, simple hockey, lower expectations.  But then putting him out in last seconds blows that out of water.
2760 2018-03-30 17:19:43 Spent 4 hours straight cleaning up an oil leak after my lacrosse game and now I can’t tell what’s oil and what’s bruises on my arms. My dumbass just spent 15 minutes trying to scrub off a bruise on my leg. 
2761 2018-03-30 17:19:38 Don’t fall for the fancy stuff. All you need is to roast them with olive oil, salt and pepper. They do all the work.
2762 2018-03-30 17:19:31 Nah. You don’t have to do all of that. Sea salt, pepper and olive oil is more than enough. Occasionally some crushed garlic.
2763 2018-03-30 17:19:27 I think you're the one with issues.  In fact, I guarantee you have many, many issues. Remember the original post was recognizing the selfless actions of the JROTC Cadets in using their bodies as human shields. Ponder on that, and have a nice day
2764 2018-03-30 17:19:13 Why don’t mobile oil change companies exist. I’ve put mine off for almost two weeks
2765 2018-03-30 17:19:11 Good friday oil change, flat fix, laundromat, and opening day for   makes a good afternoon.
2766 2018-03-30 17:19:03 Perfect. Did you read the part about no impact on the area around the spill? Fyi, Canadian spill prevention and response is second to no other country. Now lets look at oil spills via rail, which is how oil is currently shipped through B.C.
2767 2018-03-30 17:18:50 Yes we cured our father in law of that with cannabis oil -
2768 2018-03-30 17:18:41 Pollution IS a big Problem.  But a fixable one.  Mother Earth controls the planet! 
To act so arrogant to think we can control Nature is extremely stupid.  Using up millions of years of the gift of oil and Not controlling our population is absolutely stupid.
2769 2018-03-30 17:18:36 But now my car is leaking oil, so I’m not getting to work today.

2777 2018-03-30 17:17:36 Roasted with sea salt, pepper, olive oil, butter and garlic. That’s it.
2778 2018-03-30 17:17:36 Had to bring my work truck to get an oil change so I’m sitting in the waiting room and I can’t tell if the guys who work here are having a who has a deeper voice competition or just talking

2793 2018-03-30 17:15:02 Paid $800 extra on student loans today (THANK YOU EXTRA PAYDAY MONTH). But also had to get an oil change for husband’s car, and new brake pads, and a new serpentine belt. You win some, you lose some. 
2794 2018-03-30 17:15:00 Body hair is the only hair that people don't really want a bunch of, but grows out beautifully itself. No conditioner, coconut oil or organic shampoo, yet you can spend tones of money on product for your shitty hair and still end up with a scalp that looks like bread crust
2795 2018-03-30 17:15:00 Stephen...where are you getting your news.... raw sewage is being dumped in our waterways right this minute.
Your assessment of the issues is off base IMHO.

2798 2018-03-30 17:14:20 I don't see it as being a throwing under the bus per se. As you see US wants to export more oil to China. And China and Russia wanting to invest in Aramco. 
There is a good deal of coordination going on here.

2800 2018-03-30 17:14:10 Not sure which oil to use? Use extra virgin olive oil – it has many beneficial effects on heart health, and people who consume olive oil may have a lower risk of heart attack or stroke. #NutritionMonth2018 #BestLifeRewarded #Healthytip #Nutritiontip

2814 2018-03-30 17:13:19 You guyssssss,I’m using fish oil and vitamin e oil for my bum and hips!!
2815 2018-03-30 17:13:18 I think you know Mugabe not ED. Despite having the resources at his disposal, ED chose not to bus or gonyet. Its you who has a harder task of arguing & spinning snake oil bullet trains, and tomato airports.
2816 2018-03-30 17:12:55 I found a new skin care line I’m very stoked on when I’m not penny pinching I’m def gunna treat myself to some good new plant based stuff (I learned coconut oil is not a fix all)
2817 2018-03-30 17:12:45 I call stuff like that “snake oil”. Back in the olden days, people thought that snake oil cured everything, when all it did was make the salesmen rich. That’s what these companies do, drain your wallet and stuff theirs with your money 
2818 2018-03-30 17:12:26 And what has happened due to reduction in crude oil prices? Come on, I’m all ears to your economics fundas. Go on.
2819 2018-03-30 17:12:09 haha! I ended up having most success with an un-oiled nonstick and pouring a bit of oil around the edges, but I was having heat / thickness problems also
2820 2018-03-30 17:12:07 Global Oil Prices have nothing to do with our governments, nor will the gradual move away from Oil.  That Real Estate has finally cooled off, is no surprise, and according to some, prices are unlikely to move for a decade now.  Over priced assets correct, no matter the govt.
2821 2018-03-30 17:11:55 Picked up some oil & scored some new gloves from the local bike shop...next stop, grab a brake bleeder.  #springmaintenance #bikelife #itson – bij harbor freight
2822 2018-03-30 17:11:54 It's probably your diet tbh. Popcorn and oily foods like that can cause break outs. Wash everyday and moisturize lightly if at all. The thing about coconut oil is that its heavy, and great for dehydrated skin. But with acne, the problem is often excess skin oils as is.
2823 2018-03-30 17:11:46 IMO he was acting out about failure to fund wall. 1st went off teleprompter about   money we had spent in Mid East wars said $7 Trillion wasted. Then went to his Syrian comments in what looked like "here's how I save money for my wall"
and on to lament we didn't seize ME oil.
2824 2018-03-30 17:11:43 Girl they some bullshit fr everytime i go the damn price change I’m like wtf. In Atlanta my oil change ain’t nothing but 25$
2825 2018-03-30 17:11:34 He is an evil little man, bent on letting oil companies have their way with our country.
2826 2018-03-30 17:11:29 People used to scale castle walls while being pelted with rocks, arrows and boiling oil. I think they can figure out an all but unmanned wall in the middle of nowhere.
2827 2018-03-30 17:11:11 The Art of the Con Man.....Snake oil salesman..
2828 2018-03-30 17:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: soggy crust with damp motor oil and shrimp.
2829 2018-03-30 17:11:00 @BillNye  interesting question... if oil were to be on water, would that, by the very definition of water, make water wet? Just curious.
2830 2018-03-30 17:10:57 Swap ‘oil’ for ‘rare earth elements’ and what you say is just as true of EVs. Most of the electricity is also created by the burning of fossil fuels.
I still own one, I just don’t pretend I’m saving the Earth while I’m driving it.
2831 2018-03-30 17:10:49 No money to be made in lowly sewage. Lots to be made fighting evil oil.
2832 2018-03-30 17:10:41 It’s almost like I don’t agree with every single thing the Labour Party has ever done.

Shocker.

(PS it’s still an oil boom and Scotland’s economy is still stronger in the UK x)
2833 2018-03-30 17:10:39 New rules fellas, we sending our girls oil vids
2834 2018-03-30 17:10:28 I hope dis baby still rember that the man he's talking trash has oil on his head

2836 2018-03-30 17:10:12 Oil change done
2837 2018-03-30 17:10:08 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
2838 2018-03-30 17:10:07 Interesting, & maybe.  He's also sacked a number of high profile royals perceived to be "pro-Washington", Saudi's also set up physical oil storage in China for the 1st time ever & the king also went to Moscow for what I belive was the 1st time ever
2839 2018-03-30 17:10:00 If the Fish oil, Vit D3, Multi-Vitamin, B-complex, etc, that you take are not 3rd party tested and free of impurities, binders and fillers, your wasting money and potentially harming yourself. Find a trusted healthcare professional to help you.
2840 2018-03-30 17:09:57 this looks so good! try it with chili oil if you can next time
2841 2018-03-30 17:09:55 Nah we’re like oil and water. Lmao
2842 2018-03-30 17:09:55 You forgot my fav “oil wankers”
2843 2018-03-30 17:09:53 @PlayMonticello How do I contact Howard Oil, your track announcer?  Google search, all your web sites, none of it has that information.
2844 2018-03-30 17:09:49 cleansing oil lah ni buat mata kabur huaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2845 2018-03-30 17:09:39 My mom and I traded cars today so mine could get an oil change and she left her car on E. My mom is a savage.
2846 2018-03-30 17:09:29 I just use coconut oil 
2847 2018-03-30 17:09:26 The Coal Industry Is Just About Dead, But Trump Has Been Lying To Unemployed Coal Miners To Obtain Their Votes! Trump Also Killed An Education Program Designed To Re-Train & Place Unemployed Coal & Oil Workers In The Growing Solar & Wind Electrical Industry! Wake Up America!
2848 2018-03-30 17:09:17 Toasted sesame oil goes well with them. I’m biased though. I can eat them any which way...my favorite 
2849 2018-03-30 17:09:08 I mixed balsamic vinegar, olive oil, garlic and some other spices and soaked the mushrooms in it for ~15 min. You can also use just the head and make it into a burger with some provolone cheese and other burger toppings
2850 2018-03-30 17:09:04 Perhaps she knew PMB will be at Atlantic city .... so she can seek plea bargain for her erstwhile moneybag bf.... Aluko the Oil Magnate
2851 2018-03-30 17:08:43 Rub some olive oil and rosemary on them. At least you'll smell "tasty" instead of looking "pasty".
2852 2018-03-30 17:08:35 อยากกินนนฟฟฟ
2853 2018-03-30 17:08:17 Oil.  Butter.  Peanut butter.  Trump.  Anything with a high fat content.
2854 2018-03-30 17:08:16 อยากกินไก่ kfc
2855 2018-03-30 17:07:57 Plz look for oil rig
2856 2018-03-30 17:07:50 いえ、残業はいつもなんでいいんですが、いま遅い時間固定で仕事しているので普通に時間の感覚がズレてたみたいです
2857 2018-03-30 17:07:46 Humannature sunflower oil pls save me hahahaha 
2858 2018-03-30 17:07:40 This POP is making my already sensitive skin even worse with the over production of oils and I’m about to faint 

TLDR: I’m going to need some product recommendations for ~oil control~ asap
2859 2018-03-30 17:07:31 Look at Cape Town, South Africa. They are soon to run out of water. No water= no life, no agriculture. Is area will become uninhabitable if something doesn't change. Wars will be fought not for oil but for drinking water.
2860 2018-03-30 17:07:25 Met @Schwarzenegger in college at 15yrs & he took on his mission to marry into the Kennedy oil family, but no guarantee it was going to last paying into their pockets as JFK/RFK saints? Not family, but country saints now! RFK's kids fostered is why it worked this way. No adoption
2861 2018-03-30 17:07:22 I think my cat needs and oil change. Does anyone know a good mecatnic?
2862 2018-03-30 17:07:12 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
2863 2018-03-30 17:07:06 Focus on those owing Oil field.
Focus on the Dantata, Idimi, Abachar , Adenugar family and there investment.
Leave Nigerians who can not afford 3 square meal alone.
2864 2018-03-30 17:07:05 ur whole face

2865 2018-03-30 17:07:00 अरे गन्ना हजारे का फैल हो गया नहीं तो इसका प्लान था उसकी भीड़ अपने पीछे करने का !!!!
2866 2018-03-30 17:06:49 Oil burning free.
2867 2018-03-30 17:06:47 Gee, imagine that! And to top it off just perfectly, both real estate and oil production affected big time by government! And both real estate and oil production are supposed to be private companies!!!
2868 2018-03-30 17:06:40 Tell me states in the east can survive on its own now apart from Anambra. In the south,no state can survive if oil is taken away from them. Lagos and ogun can survive without allocation from FG. Kaduna and Kano are driving toward being independent from FG allocation.
2869 2018-03-30 17:06:39 just learned the new trend is putting cannabis oil in water so kids can relax
2870 2018-03-30 17:06:28 damn that makes sense oil prolly only goes in the front if you're driving in reverse
2871 2018-03-30 17:06:25 "O mundo é uma bola de haxixe eu sou o oil" obrigado ubr 
2872 2018-03-30 17:06:20 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the Lord Forever.
Psalms 23:5-6 NKJV
2873 2018-03-30 17:06:17 Try a small drop of kitchen oil. If that doesn't work, email us at info@peakdesign.com
2874 2018-03-30 17:06:10 Umm. The Eurozone imports 9.4 mio bbl per day (as much as China), has a freely convertible currency, is 25% of global reserves, the world’s most international banking system, 4 oil majors, and equidistance between Iran & KSA.
2875 2018-03-30 17:06:03 Dont remember Labour campaigning for a sovereign oil fund!
2876 2018-03-30 17:05:57 That’s what Venezuela said - when they were the richest country in S.A. with vast oil reserves, abundant resources, and a great economy - but they decided to solve that “income inequality” problem cuz some ppl making more than others simply can’t be allowed. 
2877 2018-03-30 17:05:56 I feel like olive oil. Extra virgin.

2880 2018-03-30 17:05:45 Come on... The barrel price of crude oil has reduced... Don't tell me your pakoda logics... I'm not a bhakt to believe everything blindly
2881 2018-03-30 17:05:34 Kanang imong inahan ba nga mag butang ug oil sa baso! abi pud nakog juice! may gani kay nabuga ra nako dayun.. pero naka tulon gyud ko gamay.! kigwa ning akong inahan!

2885 2018-03-30 17:04:53 The perks of having your mom own a car shop is you get free service , oil changes , the works and if something breaks it will be fixed  thanks God
2886 2018-03-30 17:04:53 Brash is a scam and u are ill advising people since it topped you have no ethics keep pumping and scamming the masses to get rich u don’t even understand the technology just marketing snake oil salesmen u are
2887 2018-03-30 17:04:47 Maybe @BetoORourke will show up so people can have a real man to talk to about issues. Not one bought and owned by oil and guns.
2888 2018-03-30 17:04:39 @LinusTech Be cool to see a mineral oil cooled pc for bitcoin mining, or maybe a antminer or something of that caliber.
2889 2018-03-30 17:04:10 Better get some oil and get back on the ball, you expendable hunk of scrap metal! 
2890 2018-03-30 17:04:09 without a doubt a rough season this year but Oiler fans were crying about him last year as well despite him putting up the same #s he has avg his whole career he will never get out of the shadow of his contract no matter what he does
2891 2018-03-30 17:04:09 I will agree that we don't drink sea water. What about all the prescription drugs being found in shell fish near the dumping sites? Oh right. That wasn't caused by oil.
2892 2018-03-30 17:04:05 Oil and a razor blade....
2893 2018-03-30 17:03:57 coconut oil saves lives
2894 2018-03-30 17:03:54 Having a known problem with my car (oil change, etc.), letting it go until it seems like there are a million more problems and it feels like the whole car is breaking down, getting it fixed & finding out everything’s OK is such a parable for my whole damn life 
2895 2018-03-30 17:03:42 Best take yet.
2896 2018-03-30 17:03:32 In terms of pop.size,demographics,resources,landscape(and logistical problems that brings),and political attitudes,Norway is more like us than ourselves!Even pump a similar amount of oil(but get to keep money).Yet somehow(somehow!)they top virtually all life quality indexes.
2897 2018-03-30 17:03:27 *runs low on groceries*
"Eh, going to the store can wait"
*runs out of daily staples*
"Ehhh, it can wait"

"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."
2898 2018-03-30 17:03:27 Kilz oil base primer = my BFF right now ... 
2899 2018-03-30 17:03:11 Doesn’t take a degree from any institution to spot an oil boom x
2900 2018-03-30 17:03:09 The UK was growing faster before we were in the EU. After we joined, our growth slowed. After the 1974 oil crisis mainland Europe never recovered. Thatcher's reforms saw the UK outgrow the rest for most of the period since. The EU has been a disaster.
2901 2018-03-30 17:03:01 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to withstand the harsh conditions of these fields.
2902 2018-03-30 17:02:38 Jesus... the price of oil is mad... oil change on the ML... £76 for 10 litres of 5W40 Halfords synthetic... £112 for Mobil1 0W40 
2903 2018-03-30 17:02:35 Change the name to hydrolised oil and Trans-fat isn't an issue.
2904 2018-03-30 17:02:30 そうですね。人間関係が少しずつ変化していくのは、いいですね
2905 2018-03-30 17:02:18 What can't Nigeria have functional refineries considering the huge economic benefits as refined petroleum products supplier than continue to glory in the archaic title of oil producing country....
2906 2018-03-30 17:02:17 いいよぉーーーーーーーー！！！！！！！！！！！！！！これからはタメで！！！！！！！よろしくね！！！！！！！
2907 2018-03-30 17:02:14 We stand on top of the worlds second largest know reserves of oil and gas, yet we pay some of the highest energy prices on the planet.  There is something very wrong with this - 50% tax on energy.
2908 2018-03-30 17:01:52 We're all grateful for his service but, he fought for oil NOT freedom, don't get it twisted!

2913 2018-03-30 17:01:32 #M5 northbound within J3 (#Birmingham #Halesowen #A456). Vehicles and oil spillage cleared to the hard shoulder and all lanes open. No delays reported.
2914 2018-03-30 17:01:25 I've done interviews in Spanish but it's only possible b/c I worked in Mexico for many years & know the oil industry vocabulary which is often not obvious or equivalent to English.
2915 2018-03-30 17:01:20 I think Saudi is more than willing to sell oil to china for Yuan if that means the removal of the Mullah's from power.
2916 2018-03-30 17:01:16 We are running low on oil, so are huddled round the log burner....

2919 2018-03-30 17:00:58 Sauerkraut, kimchi are very good Paleo foods that aid in gut health and probiotic bacteria. If it's available in your country buy them. Check if any veg. Oil , msg is added in them or not. Usually they won't be but check anyway

2922 2018-03-30 17:00:47 @GreenPartyAB must be hard to be green there with so many oil fanatics. Imagine if klein had used that fund, what was it, it had some weird name and was huge. Anyways imagine if he had used it to invest in wind and solar? Alberta would be raking in the profits from clean energy.
2923 2018-03-30 17:00:46 someones gonna have a nice evening !
2924 2018-03-30 17:00:44 That's because he only took the job because he & Vladimir thought he would have the authority to get rid of sanctions on Arctic Circle oil drilling. Who says the Trump administration hasn't been entirely transparent?
2925 2018-03-30 17:00:27 I guess the latitude under Schedule VII of Companies Act is quite wide. For the Sardar patel statue, Oil Ministry compelled its PSU's to pay under 'protection of national heritage", but the fact that a Gujarat Govt company has to go to Amethi to do CSR is unprecedented corruption

2933 2018-03-30 16:59:57 They’re both the same to me tbh. I’d use them interchangably. I have the kaylux too and it’s just an oil with mica in it ( still pops though) so it’s more of a sheer glow where the Becca is more of a gel and is opaque.
2934 2018-03-30 16:59:57 Omg I feel so sorry for Rico. I know he wanted some kind of female intimacy but I don't think Khloe's clinging attention was what he bargained for. See them sharing a bed. Oil and water lmao #bbnaija

Can't we have some sort of augmented reality app that lets us see stuff that's been painted instead?
2941 2018-03-30 16:58:38 Because the world uses 250-300M BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) of energy daily. Of that oil is close to 100 or 1000 barrels/second & the big majority of the rest is coal, gas and nuclear. Renewables do NOT have the scale required to power energy and food needs for 8B+ people !!

2949 2018-03-30 16:57:40 That oil will make its way to the coast somehow. Pipeline or not. If there is a demand for it, it will make it there somehow.
2950 2018-03-30 16:57:28 My face is gettin bad. I think because i used the cleansing oil and it is not suitable for my face T_T

2952 2018-03-30 16:57:10 Companies should do their CBC's on any and every prospective employee, regardless of their position, especially when working in an industry such as oil. Negligence is never a defense.
2953 2018-03-30 16:57:07 America has actually been importing very little gas and oil recently due to the new method of fracking. More oil and gas has been discovered in the US and we actually export some too
2954 2018-03-30 16:56:57 Phone autocorrecting it to I.t ?  Just gotta swap your oil and filter.  Will be good as new!
2955 2018-03-30 16:56:55 I once ribbed jalapeño oil in my  eye.

It was a horrid affair for 3 days.
2956 2018-03-30 16:56:55 70 dollars for an oil change
2957 2018-03-30 16:56:51 Oil of embrocation every time!
2958 2018-03-30 16:56:35 Hi Hannah,
I think we’re all ready for spring now, winter is tough on your skin!
Have you tried a natural oil to balance your complexion? Vitamin e oil restores moisture levels and smooths the dermis, leaving you with healthier more beautiful skin without  harsh chemicals!
2959 2018-03-30 16:56:35 It's because Clattenburg left for the oil money
2960 2018-03-30 16:56:30 Coconut oil ur skin & toothpaste for ones you’ve popped
2961 2018-03-30 16:56:27 Oil selavu micham pandranga ma
2962 2018-03-30 16:56:26 Also true
2963 2018-03-30 16:56:21 May the best oil win!
2964 2018-03-30 16:56:09 Gonna go get my oil changed ;)
2965 2018-03-30 16:56:02 Good point.  Play that out - if China is to allow something to happen to Iran, "someone else" must supply China that oil (pricing it in CNY, like Iran is.)  If either Saudi or US look to replace Iran's oil supplies to China, must they price it in CNY?
2966 2018-03-30 16:55:56 I was like......my scalp is oily, why would I put MORE oil on my head?? I was so dumb
2967 2018-03-30 16:55:55 Nice you sound very handy nothing worse than painting nicotine stained popcorn ceiling have to use oil primer and I try to avoid that as much as possibletaking popcorn off ceiling sucks too have to skim coat it its a lot of work
2968 2018-03-30 16:55:51 Am I the only female that hates taking their car to get their oil changed?
2969 2018-03-30 16:55:44 Many ways to ingest CBD, I use a night time CBD oil and it's phenomenal. Comes from cannabis but has no THC or psychoactive properties. It's nature's miracle drug
2970 2018-03-30 16:55:41 When the citizens of this oil rich nation begin to realize that they are paying the highest prices for fuel (home and transportation) in the world - because of government legislation and taxes, things will change.  This is how political change starts.
2971 2018-03-30 16:55:37 problem w public policy these days - it isn’t binary. We opposed the bill, support tax reform. In reform some provisions (like reduce Corp rate to be competitive) wld remain, but paid for by eliminating other breaks like those Oil & gas (in code since 1918).
2972 2018-03-30 16:55:15 They've never managed to get tobacco or gun companies, can't see them having better luck with oil. 
2973 2018-03-30 16:55:11 How many seconds or minutes do I leave the oil warming up before refrying beans ? Asking for a friend
2974 2018-03-30 16:54:51 Convinced @kcevans_  that your phone keyboard has oil that needs replaced every 5000 texts 
2975 2018-03-30 16:54:42 Its a good idea to get the camera at the door so you can spot the snake oil salesman before you open it. Lol In this case it was a wise investment.

2979 2018-03-30 16:54:19 Most of the oil we use is actually our own. As much as I hate OPEC, this will probably hurt American oil more than them.
2980 2018-03-30 16:54:06 So true....a snake oil salesman. He tips his head over and his mouth is goin and the hands are goin and it's all lies, exaggerations, half truths, and bullshit and u know what? So many people believe it or want to believe it but he is in way over his head.
2981 2018-03-30 16:54:05 The oil industry will never allow plastic bottles to go away.
2982 2018-03-30 16:53:55 If the oil is going to go to the coast no matter what, I'd prefer it in a pipeline not more trains or trucks. I have more faith in Kinder-Morgan to get it to the coast safely than CP Rail and CN Rail.
2983 2018-03-30 16:53:53 Omg I just got some Jamaican hair oil for my hair in the hopes that it will speed up the growth process. My mom recommended oil treatments to me when I was younger but I never listened!!!!!! Boba

2987 2018-03-30 16:53:21 This week in JP Commits Culinary Atrocities: 1) I made burgers but ate them with regular bread slices cause I forgot to buy burger buns. 2) I also forgot to use oil while making fried eggs.
2988 2018-03-30 16:53:20 As you progress with the painting, you add paint in thicker layers with the medium of your choice, again, always with a few drops of Cobalt. Thickest, most oil/medium, or most resinous, is always the last layer. As the Turpentine evaporates, so the painting begins to dry.

2996 2018-03-30 16:52:05 I am that person that takes full advantage of the free cookies while getting my oil changed & gets up every 10 minutes to eat another & I’m not even sorry.
2997 2018-03-30 16:51:40 Sorry, one can only assume. Nearly 30 years after Rio oil demand is showing steady growth. Also, oil market is undergoing fundamental changes partly driven by technological revolution and geopolitical shifts

3002 2018-03-30 16:50:59 I also suggest taking a bath. You look like you were working in the oil fields all day.  Generally people would prefer not to smell all that on you so, I mean, don’t stink

3017 2018-03-30 16:48:59 You can also find inexpensive oils from Now Foods to seal your hair. You probably are in need of a haircut. Also straightening your hair a lot can contribute to the dryness. 4c is the driest of the hair types so you need butters, oil and thick creams to keep it moisturized.
3018 2018-03-30 16:48:42 Because you created pesticides to strengthen food prod in order to make more money. Because you deregulated in order to produce oil more cheaply to save money polluting more. Too many cars. Rich companies didn't provide health care benefits making money on poor, sick workforce.

3025 2018-03-30 16:47:49 @NatashaAkpoti thank you very much for taking the battle of Ajaokuta Steel Complex to the next level, some several self acclaimed lovers of Ajaokuta and Nigeria non oil sectors once started the fight got bribed or intimidated along the way to dropped out but you remained resolute

3027 2018-03-30 16:47:43 Very few oil companies nowadays, most are energy suppliers and heavily into renewables with guaranteed profits from subsidies. They can't lose.
3028 2018-03-30 16:47:24 Fruits are rad and a good step towards right. As far as vegetable go, Kylee likes them really cooked tender. So we microwave a bag of frozen brocoli and cauliflower for 7 minutes. Heat up a pan with some olive oil. I sprinkle a bit of dried rosemary to give it a little aromic
3029 2018-03-30 16:47:21 Stay tuned for my bracket. Going to get my oil changed so I’ll have time to reflect
3030 2018-03-30 16:47:13 The Atlantic Richfield Corporation better known as Arco the BP Foundation, add the Joseph Pew charitable trusts AKA Sun oil Sunco are also major donators to the tides Foundation.

We feel your pain, Have you tried a natural product like vitamin E oil? Vitamin E oil helps balance a problem complexion, preventing future break outs and repairs cells to reduce the appearance of scars. Worth a shot?!

3047 2018-03-30 16:45:12 So many cam girls, so little coconut oil...
3048 2018-03-30 16:45:07 I shared this because I believe we can achieve a balance in the oil industry in Canada but mostly because I want people to recognize the plight of the our countries First Nations people and their continued marginalization.

3059 2018-03-30 16:43:40 This is not at all worth your time @EnergyInDepth just stop. Oil is not the future and is not worth even attempting to justify/fight for. It's sickening that you stand by this article enough to promote it

3074 2018-03-30 16:42:15 You can use a few drops of  Cobalt drier, but only a few or it will crack.  With oil you should always start with the thinest/most dilute paint, with no extra oils or resins. So the first layer, possibly a grisaille, which can be dry by the end of the day.
3075 2018-03-30 16:42:05 Promised $9.99 oil change for as long as I own vehicle....now they change their mind.... bumped up to $39.99. Do the right thing @everettbuickgmc and "grandfather" in Your customers promised this. #dotherighthing #honor #integrity

3077 2018-03-30 16:42:02 3 year 36000miles warranty. I’m talking bout a simple oil change. Jack up car, unscrew oil pan, drain all oil, rescrew oil pan, swap oil filter for new oil, unjack car, unscrew oil cap under da hood, refill oil with funnel, screw back on oil cap. 
3078 2018-03-30 16:41:51 Soooo obvious! And Gagosian follows the game!.... Sorry.... the money. What is next? Jackson Pollock dripping paintings or oil paint large squigees from Gerhard Richter? Lots of brain, but running out of ideas.

3082 2018-03-30 16:41:34 It would be a proxy war. We’ve been involved in those before. If Putin decides to take Ukraine, we should try to isolate Russia economically from the world economy. Tough to do, because of oil, but might be possible. It would be akin to German invasion of Czechoslovakia.
3083 2018-03-30 16:41:33 @armstrongcbc How about a piece on the absurdity of incenting oil companies to look for more oil with what we know now about climate change. We have a lot less time than people think!

3098 2018-03-30 16:40:05 You are joking right? "The proven oil reserves in Saudi Arabia are the largest in the world, estimated to be 268 billion barrels (43×109 m3) (Gbbl hereafter), including 2.5 Gbbl in the Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone."

3103 2018-03-30 16:38:54 Unless we look towards the future, rather than stacking up the cash from the past, we will fail to be a #greater nation. Subsidizing #RenewablesNow is our future. #Coal and oil have done enough damage. We can put them to bed with the horse and buggy, and sailing ship. Bon voyage!

3107 2018-03-30 16:38:43 We don't need oil but we're tearing up the earth to get it because we can't afford to switch to renewable resources because we're giving all that money to the oil industry.
3108 2018-03-30 16:38:43 Yep, been watching has go up in 10 cent increments. But diesel went down 2 cents. It's all made from the same oil. Gouging.
3109 2018-03-30 16:38:40 Uh, no thanx ... will stick to my Oil of Olay 
3110 2018-03-30 16:38:34 What about other energy producers that are using coal, for example? Finally, if we ban oil use for burning, how majority of people will be able to drive cars, hit their homes and have electrical power? Banning oil is not enough -- infrastructure to replace oil burning is needed!
3111 2018-03-30 16:38:31 oil crisis?
3112 2018-03-30 16:38:20 Just buy a big jar of coconut oil. Need for shaving cream eradicated!
3113 2018-03-30 16:38:19 Made my own pizza with all the random veggies and spices I had in the house, drizzled in olive oil. My body is ready.
3114 2018-03-30 16:38:17 lolol.... there is some stuff you can get. You mix it with their shampoo...It kills the fleas and prevents them from getting on the babies. And it's really good for skin problems too. Look for Australian Tea Tree Oil.. In the brown bottles
3115 2018-03-30 16:38:15 Time provinces had more independence from corporate global feds. Carbon tax is anscheme. No real effort by fed gov to reduce emissions or reduce dependence on oil &derived products. They continue with Subsidises to corps&r complicit in destruction.

3119 2018-03-30 16:37:50 It's called free market capitalism.  Only the most relevant, affordable, and cost effective industries survive.  Coal/oil was our backbone, but your backbone can only last so long before it deteriorates, and needs to be replaced by a newer younger stronger one.  DONT FEAR CHANGE.

3131 2018-03-30 16:35:57 "In oil & gas we think so narrowly about what "data" is.

3134 2018-03-30 16:35:09 If it is not Israel dragging the United States into another war, it is the bankers and the oil corporations. The whole political and economic system of the United States and the west in general is designed for war, death and destruction.

3136 2018-03-30 16:34:50 Do not get me wrong -- I am for reduction of fossil fuel. However, this case is ridiculous & should be thrown out 4 many reasons. Oil is used not just to burn, but for making a lot of other things. How they can prove that oil of these 5 companies is a reason for climate change?

3138 2018-03-30 16:34:34 I have driven to Valvoline 4 times in the past 3 days to get my oil changed but always left without getting anything done because I didn’t understand the drive thru system and my anxiety made me too nervous to ask.

3140 2018-03-30 16:34:26 The reason the Saudis are getting away from oil is they are out of oil. Their wells have run dry. The only one really with untapped oil in the middle east is Israel. Why the Saudi's are financing their attack. They are sitting on one of the largest untapped oil reserve found.

3187 2018-03-30 16:29:20 I make a ton of rice in the rice cooker and have that for days. I stir fry frozen veggies with a touch of spicy oil and that takes about 3-4 minutes. Add to the rice. Also lots of apples and almond butter.

3192 2018-03-30 16:28:52 Honestly I would change the oil on my car myself but when you buy everything you need for it, it amounts to what you could spend on someone just doing it. So here I am, sipping my coffee waiting for my car to be done 
3193 2018-03-30 16:28:42 And that’s why it’s time to go Green. We need to end oil and all it’s byproducts which kill our rivers and oceans and everything in its path including the air we breath. The technology is out there. We just need to use it but the Elite r greedy and destructive

3212 2018-03-30 16:26:01 I'd prob just do oil and balsamic tho. Easier.

3229 2018-03-30 16:24:15 Pls try follow the Nigerian history. You can google it. Lagos never really depended on the so called oil. 
Lagos is the centre of excellence forget capital city. Its has the largest port,busiest market,silicon valley,highest in tax remittance to FG. I stand to be corrected.

3235 2018-03-30 16:23:28 Thank God for the person behind Navaratna cooling hair oil. Summer time outing doesn't take a toll on you and can have a peaceful sleep as well.

However yuck/weird it may sound. The point is. It does the job. And does it very well!

3256 2018-03-30 16:21:47 Eastern Canada ships the oil in ‘whale killing’ OIL TANKERS because they don’t have pipelines
3257 2018-03-30 16:21:38 EIA: US crude production rose by 6Kbpd in January to 9.964Mbpd & revised Dec report up by 9K barrels to 9.958Mbpd - $USO $OIL $XLE $XOP $OIH
3258 2018-03-30 16:21:35 @PoliceChiefs 

  Egypt's Assassins control Islam and all oil by controlling all drugs on this planet. Thus, one cannot gangster in any country unless one gets their approval.

3260 2018-03-30 16:21:22 Very cool! I underestimated dry oil for years and love it now too.

3262 2018-03-30 16:21:10 I'm sorry but oli and any type of exercise go together about as well as water and oil. E sports do not count
3263 2018-03-30 16:21:07 When the world economy is doing well, resource-based economies such as Russia typically do well too. When the oil price was high, this also helped enormously.
The one thing Obama got right though, was fracking. This has kept oil and gas prices low, crippling the Russian economy.
3264 2018-03-30 16:21:06 Need CBS oil? Have a customer that wants to order a 4 PK with someone.

3278 2018-03-30 16:19:38 I am cooking arroz meloso con alcachofas, habas y guisantes (a Murcian dish of rice cooked in vegetable stock, with olive oil, bay leaves, fried onions, green peppers, garlic, artichoke hearts, peas & broad beans). It's rather like a Spanish risotto.

3295 2018-03-30 16:18:05 Greenpeace does tell the truth; the oil companies often do not. As for being a charity, Greenpeace tries to directly change public policy and the law and is, therefore, barred from registering as a charity. Now you know the truth, not that it will matter much, I suspect.

3298 2018-03-30 16:18:00 Day 1 of my mum using CBD oil for medical purposes and what a difference it has made. She can lift her arms in the air and the constant shaking has stopped  literally the best feeling in the world 
3299 2018-03-30 16:17:52 Point is it's piddling, as no one shits themselves over oil going up or down $20. And these predictions are worse case.Consider the middle ground say the impact is 3-4% over 15 years! You expect to convince #Brexiters, especially low paid who have been shafted by free movement?
3300 2018-03-30 16:17:36 I've discarded a lot of tweets like that. Especially when I thought that @molratty was wrong, and then realized that that wasn't true.
3301 2018-03-30 16:17:13 Lemme go get this oil change
3302 2018-03-30 16:17:03 Rather that having to rearrange your cat's private area... Try adding a tablespoon of vegetable oil to your cat's food... It will change the consistency of the feces and the pup won't look at it as appetizing

3305 2018-03-30 16:16:56 Perhaps. But I just can’t get past the smell or taste. Even the mustard fish my maid cooks (she is Bengali) is difficult for me to eat. Mustard oil is not a problem though

3326 2018-03-30 16:14:49 We don't want to punish the oil companies as they make a small margin of profit on fuel at the pump.  We want to punish the three levels of government because of the taxes on a litre of gas, they are very clearly the biggest bandits.  Protest that.

3328 2018-03-30 16:14:22 Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn't send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East.

3404 2018-03-31 23:50:43 Silly. The NRA don't want to help you keep guns. The less you have the easier is to come for the oil and the water. If war ever breaks out between the US and Canada's bestie China- who do you think will be hosting the battle? So cute.
3405 2018-03-31 23:50:41 It’s time to update your skincare for the seasonal changes!! 

What to expect: 
-dehydration, over production of your oil glands, pigmentation, premature aging and sun damage, etc
3406 2018-03-31 23:50:31 I remember. You’ve always been a dime tho, hun! I’m breaking out because I’m growing facial hair; my skin is producing a lot more oil and my pores are getting bigger. It’s normal 4 me, considering how long I’ve been taking testosterone.. but some people are just flat out RUDE

3434 2018-03-31 23:41:37 As an Albertan, I've mostly heard Albertans bad mouthing other Canadians not the reverse.  Oil and gas workers chose to work in a boom and bust industry with little job security. That's one of the reasons pay is so high. Tough when it ends, but not a reason to lash out at others.
3435 2018-03-31 23:41:37 Great advice. Mine have dry skin and skin allergies to grass. Yep grass. So after they play, I have to use prescription allergy shampoo, but have added the Cowboy Magic because the other one left them dry. A little coconut oil sounds like what I need.

3451 2018-03-31 23:39:28 Avocado fruit has carbs. Might the sweet taste be residual material from the presssing? I never got into avo oil -- too buttery, unappealing mouthfeel. (Similarly, I don't like buttery olive oils either.) Olives have some carbs too but never had a "sweet" EVOO from any terroir.
3452 2018-03-31 23:39:16 I just showered with this charcoal body wash blended with coconut oil, lavender + chamomile... nigga... I feel so smooth.
3453 2018-03-31 23:39:09 Roasted in the oven with olive oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper and suddenly you are a trendy chef
3454 2018-03-31 23:39:08 Then if the power is available at a guaranteed and affordable price people can still conserve but plan long-term. Then they might to heat pumps from oil and perhaps electric cars could be more appealing. More on this and the economics of electricity in my column next week.
3455 2018-03-31 23:38:50 I don't know...possible fuel oil..looks in good shape too.
3456 2018-03-31 23:38:32 I’m not really looking for info on the photo, but an enviro historian who has expertise on 1969 since I’m organizing a panel on famous enviro events of 1969 (Cuyahoga Fire; SB oil spill; turning off Niagara Falls) and need a commentator who usually attends ASEH
3457 2018-03-31 23:38:13 He was highly sought after. So was David Clarkson, Brad Richards, etc. Not everything works out, GM’s need to start working away from long term deals for players, especially when a large portion of those years are after the player turns 30. That’s where “age curves” come in (1/2)
3458 2018-03-31 23:37:57 دكتور محمد, ممكن دليل علي كلامك او مثال او اي شي تحت؟
3459 2018-03-31 23:37:05 Because the oil industry has been successful in convincing many Albertans that it serves them and not shareholders and management, Albertans are prepared to blame everyone else for what is the industry's self-inflicted wound.
3460 2018-03-31 23:36:59 Them half them Mexicans got oil field hats also and they ain’t ever seen a rig in person lmfao
3461 2018-03-31 23:36:58 But hey, if it makes you feel better that our oil developments is some plucky industry constantly fighting against the obstruction of governments and succeeding at all despite it, have at it.

You're not the first to feel I should get more money because I was lucky?

3467 2018-03-31 23:35:36 If you can’t provide any economic reasons for B.C., then all we have remaining from your idea is the risk with oil tankers and oil spills...and that you won’t be able to sell Canada on, let alone the great people of B.C.! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #stopkm
3468 2018-03-31 23:35:22 I agreed with you *until* you mentioned "Rothschild oil greed."
That is an antisemitic trope.

Rothschild is not an oil company. They are at most a medium sized bank.
Why did you not say Esso, Shell, or BP instead?

3471 2018-03-31 23:34:42 It's well documented. Is it hard to believe Russia, whose economy relied almost entirely on export of oil in 2014, would be hurt when market was flooded with supply? Ties to oil oligarchs were already found.

Also, do your chem homework. Not every isotope is useful for batteries.

3491 2018-03-31 23:32:00 You’re preaching to the converted, although it wasn’t a point about BEV’s superior convenience and cost to the consumer.
Imagine you’re an oil company like Shell and try to list new business models with alternative fuels with your existing business infrastructure and assets.

3497 2018-03-31 23:31:15 And before you try to condemn that we do eat what we kill and in the case of the bear we even render down the fat for use as cooking oil
3498 2018-03-31 23:31:14 it'll take some getting used to (when I swapped to rinsing+moisturising only in the morning I felt gross as hell, apparently this is very common) but it settles down after a week or two. Overwashing makes your skin produce even more oil to compensate so probs try that?
3499 2018-03-31 23:31:02 I love your rest and relax range especially the bath soak and roll on oil they are fab

As soon as we drop our support, they'll drop US like a Hot Potato.
Their goal is to carve out a new Kurdistan from Syria.

3505 2018-03-31 23:28:58 Not my thing.

Rubbed it with a paste of anchovies, garlic, rosemary, and olive oil. (Supposed to use butter, but that is very not-kosher)

And then squeeze lemon on top before roasting. I used water in the roasting pan instead of wine, no issue at alll.

3524 2018-03-31 23:25:33 They don’t know exactly cause there’s not much money for research but doctors and massage therapists have about 5 scents they warn about and it’s the main one. Jasmine is bad for me too, and Rosemary in essential oil form is meant to be bad too but for me isn’t
3525 2018-03-31 23:25:21 $90 for an oil change $90. Damn German made car with that damn full synthetic oil 90 damn dollars. Damn I’m hurt
3526 2018-03-31 23:25:11 So Israel funded the very ppl that seek to murder every Jew that they can find?  Does that really make a lot of sense to u?
3527 2018-03-31 23:24:59 Any time I see someone talking about coconut oil usage for hair I think of @GingerWesson's video and I cringe. Y'all. Stop. Do your research.

3529 2018-03-31 23:24:17 I don’t know who the main recruiter is for Loyola of Chicago but whoever he is he deserves raise. They put together a well oil machined. They are good at every position. Sheesh.

3532 2018-03-31 23:23:46 @AnandWrites regarding your comments about “working class whites” & identity politics - there is truth to it - the squeaky wheel gets the oil & as diversity envelops our nation u think working class whites won’t make demands like all other groups?  Gonna be fun to watch

3537 2018-03-31 23:22:51 Are you saying that national security and oil are the same thing? And why steal Syrian oil, haven't your masters got enough already?

3541 2018-03-31 23:22:29 I’m sorry but how did the so-called greatest nation on earth end up with so many people in it who could so easily be duped by this snake oil charlatan? How??
3542 2018-03-31 23:22:23 I just had a customer that was looking for some type of oil right? The big oil is like $12.99, but he didn’t want it cause the bottle is “too ugly”. He got the smaller that is $16.99.. This cat said it’s all about “quality”

3583 2018-03-31 23:16:05 no chop all the rubbing ingredients together (oil, spices, onion, chili) then rub thru the potato mix so that it's covered in the oil.  You could cook this in a frypan with a lid,  on low and take lid off,  turn to high at the last to crisp the veggies

3588 2018-03-31 23:15:15 BC is going to ban gasoline powered vehicles from its roads by 2040, IMO.  Thousands of people are willing go to prison over these idiotic pipelines and they will never be built.  And as a bonus, this issue might lead to BC banning all oil tanker traffic from its coast. #bcpoli

Take biotin supplements (biotin strengthens hair which includes your nails)

Sugar bear hair is another gummy that is good for strengthening your nails

Just like your hair the most important part is the roots so using cuticle oil helps with growth

3610 2018-03-31 23:10:57 Our productivity is behind the UK and our GDP growth has stalled since the Indythreat 2014. We need oil, oil services and the associated supply chain tax income to improve just to stand still.
3611 2018-03-31 23:10:56 How did the US take the oil? Who took it? Not the Trump administration? Who didn't see the destruction coming?
3612 2018-03-31 23:10:55 It’s called the “null hypothesis.”
The default position whenever any claim is made is, “doubt it is true until evidence demonstrates it is true.”
It prevents people from gullibly believing con men, snake oil salesmen, or conspiracy theories.
3613 2018-03-31 23:10:51 Always wary. The other day a cross-wearer behind me in the grocery line started unloading MY cart and telling me how oil pulling would save my joints.
3614 2018-03-31 23:10:35 But we'll be replacing them with different types of extraction methods of rare earth metals that will do as much, if not more harm.

If you've ever watched an anti-fracking video, you've watched Russian propaganda. Fracking caused oil market downturn, really hurt Russian economy

3622 2018-03-31 23:09:22 @Toyota tech says I can wait for 6000 miles for oil change, but he can't turn off the "maintenance reguired" warning on the display at 3000 miles. #wth? Can this thing be bypassed, reprogrammed?
3623 2018-03-31 23:09:08 Nigeria has one of the highest GDPs in Africa. Neo-colonialism has left it riddled with corruption, with a destructive oil sector, conflict, and famine. 

In the wealthiest country on the continent.

3625 2018-03-31 23:08:29 Russians have been doing far more about oil than Iran. Plus if the SDF (although you noted that the YPG is really in charge) were to cut a deal with Government it may actually lessen the cost of the war and reduce Gov reliance on Iran.

3632 2018-03-31 23:07:44 Absolutely correct but so far the US has thwarted any country using from their own oil for the benefit of the people in that country. Let’s hope Syria prevails.
3633 2018-03-31 23:07:39 For me, he was Mr. Red Sock (Sox?) in the 80's, but I missed the Oil Can comments, which I have just discovered. In retrospect, maybe it makes extra sense he was popular in Boston. Later, of course, he rode that horse around Yankee Stadium, which felt nice at the time.
3634 2018-03-31 23:07:14 Lmaooo sis just thank God you've not met any jibiti master. Before you say oil they're on their knees crying and talking about how they don't know what came over them/happened 
3635 2018-03-31 23:07:11 Turning the oil tanker will take some time, but at least we've regained control of the helm. All credit to people like @jeremycorbyn and @johnmcdonnellMP, Max and others, who by remaining in Labour made the last 2 years possible. To my shame, I didn't.
3636 2018-03-31 23:06:54 Then why won’t you put oil in it now?
3637 2018-03-31 23:06:47 i just deep cleaned my room and bathroom and have my fav essential oil in the diffuser listening to music #content
3638 2018-03-31 23:06:29 It was never our oil. The oil belongs to the people of Syria. We're not giving it to Iran. If you'll check you maps, Iraq is still between Syria and Iran.

3641 2018-03-31 23:05:47 Well, The US 'Deep State' Military and Intelligence 'Factions' aren't supporting the Kurds so much as "using" them along with ISIS to 'carve out sections of Syria's oil sector, dividing the country. 
Which is also what Turkey is actually doing as well.
Syria & Russia will respond
3642 2018-03-31 23:05:34 Is some big booty lathered in baby oil too much to ask for?!? 
3643 2018-03-31 23:05:16 for anyone who has a nose piercing!!!! if u use tea tree oil on it ( diluted ) how many times a day is okay to do? once? twice?
3644 2018-03-31 23:05:12 Also this idea that just to limit Iranian influence you will need to confront the Government and Iran in Syria, and to do so it will obviously cause further suffering. And that all Sunnis fear Iran and if the Gov comes back, Iran will rule the roost over all oil.

3653 2018-03-31 23:03:47 The equivalent of an oil change for a petrol car! No big deal! As a future customer with a BMW with 3 recalls that I have been waiting 6 months to schedule, I will be so glad when my Model 3 comes and I can charge from my solar PV and never need to go to gas station or oil change
3654 2018-03-31 23:03:46 What in the everloving fuck does Syria's oil thousands of miles away from the US have to do with "US national security interests"? Wait...

Oh wow that was easy.
3655 2018-03-31 23:03:18 Or strip mining our national park lands that were leased to oil,gas and mining companies.

3667 2018-03-31 23:02:16 it's "all over his face"? Are  you sure it wasn't just residue from the snake oil he was drinking?
3668 2018-03-31 23:02:13 More smog, less visibility, more sick, dying and dead, and best of all, more profits for oil companies; the best of all worlds if you're a dinosaur with a penchant for nothing but profits and could careless about the human factor....
3669 2018-03-31 23:02:07 Such a shame all the crooks are ready to grab what isn’t theirs. The Golan was found to contain more oil than all of the Middle East.  It truly is the promised land.  I wonder how God is going to react to crooks showing up for it.
3670 2018-03-31 23:01:29 That is why Turkey is stepping up actions in Syria and giving the US nasty looks. The US have taken 3 oilfields. Turkey can no longer get cheep oil from isis. Turkey's funding of isis by buying oil from them has been long known.
3671 2018-03-31 23:01:20 I had to take a step back from following  beauty expert skin care routines, it made my skin look worse! Too much. I use bio oil as well tho and I discovered that the best night creme for me is good old Nivea creme in the blu tin.
3672 2018-03-31 23:00:58 were you drinking.... 100% pure coconut....oil?
3673 2018-03-31 23:00:57 I KNOW WHAT THAT IS! In my youth, I worked summers in oil fields in Oklahoma, gauging tanks & sending crude to refineries. Pumpjacks everywhere. Lots of sucker rod fences.

3678 2018-03-31 22:59:26 But the oil isn't America's or Iran's to take. Are you stupid?
3679 2018-03-31 22:59:25 How money can change. Not how times change. Without oil City are nothing. Imagine City have spent over 2 Billion since the Abu dhabi take over.  

Still just 3 EPLs.

3682 2018-03-31 22:59:07 The US doesn't need the oil either. They just don't want Syrian children to have it.

3697 2018-03-31 22:56:41 So do we start seeing WTI & Brent contracts go no bid?  Or does the opposite happen as the eastern world abandons their dollars, starts recycling them through the WTI contracts, thus putting upward pressure on oil and downward pressure on the dollar? Trying to play this out.
3698 2018-03-31 22:56:36 What is the matter with you people?

3702 2018-03-31 22:56:19 The "water packed" tuna is in a soy-containing broth, so "non-GMO" has some plausibility. I get enraged by the labeled tuna packed in olive oil
3703 2018-03-31 22:56:15 Oh.

That's not a great reason, then. If we have less uranium than oil then nuclear may still not be cost effective.

I do not support Trump or trust that this decision has good intentions but FFS the US shouldn't even be in Syria. The US caused the Syrian horror by funding the terrorists.

3723 2018-03-31 22:51:17 You could literally fry a piece of chicken with the amount of oil my fucking face produces

3734 2018-03-31 22:49:59 We underestimate how doing hard physical labor all your life can be hard on your body.  I think of both of my grandfathers (farmer and oil field worker).  My grandmothers worked equally hard plus birthed a number of children.
3735 2018-03-31 22:49:48 "Among 136 oil and gas executives interviewed by the Dallas Fed March 14-22, the response to how much they need per barrel to cover costs of new developments in the U.S. averaged $52, and just $35 for existing wells." Oil sands producers: $20-$30CDN. Who's high cost now?

Of course, it’s not the direction things are headed in, but there are some clear reasons why oil companies would consider moving in to hydrogen.

3766 2018-03-31 22:45:20 I never tweet but if I had to use common sense I'd say somebody just got bought out by the oil cartels...just putting it out there in the universe.

3771 2018-03-31 22:44:54 The only reason the rural area (Murphy) even survives is the mountains. Line the mountains with gas and oil wells to pollute the environment and tourists will go elsewhere.
3772 2018-03-31 22:44:17 America has destabilized many places in Central America. Whether it be through intimidation, use of Jackals, or assasinations. Most, seem quite clear.

3773 2018-03-31 22:44:06 I personally like to put some bath salts in the tub, fill it up with hot water, put my oil diffuser in the bathroom with some lavender scented oil in it, some nice chill music, and then, just sink down into the water to relax.
3774 2018-03-31 22:43:56 I can't shake this fishy smell at work that's driving me crazy. I think it's the oil they use on the sorting machines.

3792 2018-03-31 22:41:31 Yes, we have oil, & I am fine if we sell all of it, but the world is moving ahead, & allowing ourselves to be stubbornly tied to oil w/o diversifying is why we're in this mess in the first place.

Your problem is not fighting against ISIS instead colonizing north of syria

3802 2018-03-31 22:38:17 Fucking goat herders brought into the modern era through others building their infrastructure and finance.  Of course, it was for the oil.  But now all the wealthy dipsomaniac princes?  And human rights violations?  I put them with Israeli Zionistas.
3803 2018-03-31 22:38:16 @RepSanfordSC if you can't keep oil rigs off our coast, and the deficit goes out of control under a Republican President, House and Senate, What good are you to the 1st district

3807 2018-03-31 22:37:19 VZ doesn't export much besides oil which is denominated in USD, so no real use case for cross border BTC, plus yes, the govt crackdown doesn't help. But if Italy or Spain go the way of Greece in five years while BTC infrastructure keeps progressing like it is currently...

Pharmisutical companies record profits!

3811 2018-03-31 22:35:58 Sentiment mostly among people who aren’t in the oil industry, based on ACR, a Soviet style system of wealth redistribution claiming oil, gas are non-renewable resources. With move to renewables and record oil, gas production looks like oil, gas are effectively not non-renewable.
3812 2018-03-31 22:35:34 I had a painful first month, but it does get better! Nipple shields, but I swear by  coconut oil in the fridge or freezer and then apply it to breast pads after feedings. Antibacterial and super soothing! Helps with chapped/cracked nips and the cooling reduces swelling.

3815 2018-03-31 22:35:26 Maybe the West needs to reevaluate their destiny! I lived back East and lived in western Canada. People on both sides are fed up with these Liberals who focus on dividing our Country .Alberta has a right to sell it’s oil. Trudeau has NO right to stop this! Vote Trudeau out 2019

3826 2018-03-31 22:33:30 As for Trump/the oil sector - they can try to fight things, but ultimately they can’t fight the laws of economics. If something else is a better technology, it will win.

I’m sure the charcoal and whale oil industries fought change too. Didn’t save them.
3827 2018-03-31 22:33:25 Will I ever get my oil changed and not get a call about the 5 other things wrong with my car?

3843 2018-03-31 22:31:12 Then why did they gun down a bunch of people who were unarmed?
3844 2018-03-31 22:31:12 So people don’t want to go get gas because they don’t want to pay the hard workers that bring us oil? I’m going to get gas on the 15th even if it’s full! This is stupid! Ha

3851 2018-03-31 22:30:56 When asked about it Harper also said the oil sands need to be slowly phased out. Trudeau is an idiot but stop blaming every1 else for having an economy purely based on a very up and down industry. Also every1 hates Albertans because youre all smug as fuck so we dont really care
3852 2018-03-31 22:30:52 oh no! Dunno if it works for dogs but when I wanted kitty to "leave it" I used a bit of orange oil spray. Makes it taste bad

3861 2018-03-31 22:29:45 What's wrong with being a good shot? In my youth I could hit an oil can multiple times with a pump shotgun before it hit the ground. The old saying "use it or lose it" really does apply to your shooting skills. I'd rather know your skilled so innocent aren't harmed, just the POS
3862 2018-03-31 22:29:45 City’s owner hasn’t invested any of his own money in almost 4 years now. City is a self-sufficient club with no debt. The money we spend is all coming from TV rights deals and sponsorships. The “oil money” stick gets kinda quite old pretty quick.

3870 2018-03-31 22:28:04 Will technology tackle consumption? Will the private sector invest in large scale projects without blackmailing government for tax breaks & risk mitigation? What will that mean to continually increasing inequality? Will Trump & the oil sector use their wealth & power to fight?

I love me some beard oil it helps loads with itchy face and ingrown hairs.
3875 2018-03-31 22:27:19 What’s the running order?
3876 2018-03-31 22:27:09 So ... you're against having a renewable source of fuel? Really?

I cook with canola oil often. I don't even keep other types of cooking oil in the house.
3877 2018-03-31 22:26:59 And things might change even more. Oil's not the be-all and end-all it once was, but the UCP and their supporters still think it is. They're the ones living in the past.
3878 2018-03-31 22:26:44 my dad, walking in from grilling: did you know olive oil is flammable?
3879 2018-03-31 22:26:37 But someone found oil

3881 2018-03-31 22:26:34 Its like getting anyone a gift, figure out what they like and get them knick-knacks related to it. Most any person has some lead on a cheap thing that they go through. 

Musician? Guitar picks and strings. Beardy? Beard oil. Shaved? Shaving soap. Etc.
3882 2018-03-31 22:26:28 Am I only the only one who thinks avocado oil tastes sweet. I can't stand it. Tried multiple kinds before and still get that sweetness from it.

3889 2018-03-31 22:24:59 Aye God better keep my moms around for a long time inno cause nobody getting that priviledge of rubbing my children foot with oil or bathing them for the first time. 
3890 2018-03-31 22:24:50 No, but you need to stop pretending that you’re the same as established clubs that have been successful for decades. There’s a reason they have money. And it ain’t oil
3891 2018-03-31 22:24:45 They've allowed fracking in the USA and are allowing oil exports to resume after several years.

Fracking will extend your prophecy's deadline for economic meltdown in the USA.
3892 2018-03-31 22:24:08 I feel that. Like if you get up it literally feels like someone is inside your brain kicking you in the head. Hot shower, oil and darkness goes a long way.
3893 2018-03-31 22:24:07 Syria doesn't have that much oil anyway and Iranians are not dying in Syria for oil.
3894 2018-03-31 22:23:52 Why does coconut oil smell so comforting? 

Like I'm here child, your hair is in my embrace now everything will be okay.
3895 2018-03-31 22:23:41 @realDonaldTrump 325 million Americans want to know why you're not stopping VIRTU PARTNERS from taking gas/heating oil prices up at the CCM? Obama did the same thing. Are you another Obama? How does higher gas/heating oil help Americans?
3896 2018-03-31 22:23:23 So he sells off our public lands to his oil buddies, but he criticizes one of America’s most successful companies @amazon for not being good for America. Yeah. Ok.

3900 2018-03-31 22:22:38 Ummm conspiracy theories by definition can’t be verified. The USA funding to stop CANADIAN oil is fully auditable.
3901 2018-03-31 22:22:35 You should go buy a POS car and just leave it on the street in a 3rd spot. Make sure it drips oil or some sort of fluid on the pavement.

3906 2018-03-31 22:21:37 I'm sure investors are looking forward to putting money into Sask oil and gas with the upcoming court and legal battles. Those won't chase that $ away right? Investors love uncertainty and ambiguity right? #skpoli

3912 2018-03-31 22:20:57 Try peppermint oil. I get really bad ones, medicine sometimes won’t help. If you put peppermint oil on the back of your neck and temples and go to sleep sometimes that shit really works.
3913 2018-03-31 22:20:54 Presidential pay is paltry AF and it’s truly (really truly) irrelevant. The graft and swamp factor of this administration is insane. He is not out for you (sadly).

3914 2018-03-31 22:20:28 Kyle, I don't boycott anyone because someone tells me too.  I think boycotts are silly.  I remember when BP's oil rig went down in the Gulf and all these people called for boycotts of them. I purchased all my gas from BP stations.

3933 2018-03-31 22:16:19 Your creating a drama and mass exaggeration. These are poly blocks which will eventually blow and spread apart. To claim an environmental disaster is misleading. Perhaps 5,000 tonnes of oil yes!!
3934 2018-03-31 22:15:51 lavender oil is all over my living room carpet and lord i have never hated that smell more than i do right now
3935 2018-03-31 22:15:40 I'm definitely going to be experimenting with coconut oil and sweet almond oil soon! I've been doing a lot of research on it. :)
3936 2018-03-31 22:15:05 Beverly Hills High School receives around $300,000 per year from a cluster of oil wells on campus.
3937 2018-03-31 22:14:49 Happy Easter I think the animal mineral oil might be for dry skin check Google
3938 2018-03-31 22:14:47 ..and drilling  for oil on  3 Tectonic Plates converging is more than dangerous. the entire west coast could be reshaped.
3939 2018-03-31 22:14:38 It was miserable. I tried everything for it too. Special sprays, witch hazel, coconut oil, Benadryl cream. I even tried to get sunburned so the affected skin would peel but no dice.
3940 2018-03-31 22:14:24 Our problem with this admin is that no matter who Trump puts in charge of an agency it will be a terrible choice & will destroy that agency & promote their own agenda Pruitt will destroy our environment & create more health issues.Oil & gas are more important than our kids lives
3941 2018-03-31 22:14:05 Peppermint oil will help!! I've had migraines on & off for the last couple weeks and I'd be lost without my oil
3942 2018-03-31 22:14:04 All done on the back of their oil wealth, but at least it is done.
3943 2018-03-31 22:13:30 Had to buy the oil and filter for my car. 
3944 2018-03-31 22:13:30 I got an oil change and went to CVS. Nice little Saturday.
3945 2018-03-31 22:13:25 4. Almond oil. 
almonds are loaded with vitamin E and it’s oil is emollient which helps in making the skin supple. Just apply little almond oil on your dark circles and massage gently. Just leave it overnight and wash it the next morning.
3946 2018-03-31 22:13:20 its between an oil slick and liquid cocaine

3949 2018-03-31 22:12:43 Lagos is a blessed City, crude oil was found in the south-south of Nigeria yet most oil companies built their head office in Lagos and carry out their operation in the South-south.
3950 2018-03-31 22:12:36 You need to spill some used motor oil and toss some sawdust around for that used look tho
3951 2018-03-31 22:12:36 Amazon is the Standard Oil of our time. It is only a matter of time until this is dealt with. Mark your calendars. You can politicize it all you like.
3952 2018-03-31 22:12:34 She's running okay; no issues I've been able to track. I'm about 1000 short of changing the oil, and I don't run it too heavy anyway. Ten years old at 62,000 miles lol.
3953 2018-03-31 22:12:33 Make sure that your moisturiser is completely free of any perfumes. After applying that daily, use a mix of strong tea tree oil and coconut oil as the last step in your skincare routine. Struggling with dry skin too

3956 2018-03-31 22:12:20 Dunno. I haven’t visited for a while. It looks like the Oil crew rounded up a bunch of volunteers to regurgitate Breitbart & Daily Caller. It seems even more derivative than I recall. Fans of Trump (naturally), RW dogwhistles & Islamophobic /pro-Israel polemic & culture war.

3959 2018-03-31 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

3962 2018-03-31 22:11:46 I haven't used Canola oil since my late 20's.  If Canola oil can be used as in insecticide...then why would I want to consume it? I tell people this and they defend canola oil tooth and nail #nothankyou
3963 2018-03-31 22:11:17 Oil companies are playing us all.  Making vast fortunes from fossil fuels while leaving the pollution to be cleaned up by others.
3964 2018-03-31 22:11:10 Let's just start here... During the oil embargo of 73, US gov agency went to USPS to distribute gas stamps. The agency was given a high price quote and notice that they're a private entity inc in Las Vegas. This resulted in 73 was the odd/even license plate gas system vs. stamps.

3970 2018-03-31 22:09:10 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
3971 2018-03-31 22:08:42 Was a republican that proposed it but nice try
3972 2018-03-31 22:08:34 Do not forget - this oil belongs to Syria. Iran has enough of the own oil.
3973 2018-03-31 22:08:26 I don't know if coconut oil helps for that??
3974 2018-03-31 22:07:54 And if you really look at Top8 results there's often a lot of the same faces like those three I mentioned, Nemo, Fuudo, Daigo, Yukado/Fujimura, Oil King... It *feels* inconsistent, but when you look at it, it's really not. (sorry for spam! Hard to make this point in one tweet!)
3975 2018-03-31 22:07:33 Every day I drink 15 & 5/7 gallons of olive oil.
3976 2018-03-31 22:07:32 besides oil, just about everything Chinese capital purchases from Venezuela is actually bought from the fascist bourgeoisie
3977 2018-03-31 22:07:19 Today I received fresh oil for 'Jay Mün'. I feel like a lion. Thank you Jerry Spokesman Aluwong
3978 2018-03-31 22:07:05 That’s photography.
3979 2018-03-31 22:06:55 If it was a VW dealership, they're very very very good about taking care of you when bad things like this happen.  Hopefully you didn't have any mechanical damage from it, oil=engine blood.  It's important
3980 2018-03-31 22:06:54 In all fairness, Scott Pruitt NEEDS that luxury townhome owned by an oil executive. He deserves it!

It's not just a matter of comfort. Top energy lobbyists don't come cheap. His price is determined by the market.

3981 2018-03-31 22:06:48 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
3982 2018-03-31 22:06:31 Big Oil. He's giving them all the tax relief. Tax relief going to big oil.
3983 2018-03-31 22:06:01 It was pretty bad because it was from a chicken. One of my hens got loose & had oil on her foot, she accidentally clawed me so it went *deep*. I always wash up but it didn't make any difference, & it took forever to go away, & spread to a spot on my other arm 
3984 2018-03-31 22:05:51 He did say he was a crude oil trucker.

He's half right, at least.

3988 2018-03-31 22:05:28 TIP: while your hair is still wet, spray a small amount of essential oil in it, and it will last twice as long as simply applying it to your skin

4007 2018-03-31 22:02:24 My dad has glioblastoma, a stage 4 brain tumor.  Cannabis Oil would shrink his brain tumor.  He can't buy it in Alabama.  It would be wonderful if it was legal and in a measured/predictable strength. Insurance coverage  would be wonderful as well.

4009 2018-03-31 22:02:12 I do energy markets research for a living. We have lots of clients that are interested in new energy tech (renewables, batteries, smart grids, etc.), very few who want to know about coal or oil.

If the economics continue in the direction they’re going, the politics will follow.
4010 2018-03-31 22:02:05 Its beyond this guy's comprehension that Syria's oil might belong to.... Syria
4011 2018-03-31 22:01:49 It think the mingling of oil 'n sweat is rather profuse already.
4012 2018-03-31 22:01:47 That's okay, u and GOP r beholden to polluters' lobbyists - oil, gas, coal.  Filthy, unhealthy energy for America which is ruining our climate & environment, even farmers r suffering with droughts - what do u care?

4021 2018-03-31 22:00:27 Preliminary research suggests that CBD oil may effectively treat addiction to alcohol, tobacco, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, and yes, even cannabis.
4022 2018-03-31 22:00:03 It’s just a question of time until the oil money runs out there then it’s back to wondering about on camels for them.

4025 2018-03-31 21:59:35 Natural plant oils have a wide range of great therapeutic effects. Coconut oil, for example, contains lauric, caprylic and capric acids, which help heal damaged skin by stimulating collagen production.
4026 2018-03-31 21:59:08 Just took a nap waiting for my oil to be changed. I wonder how many people snap chapped me 
4027 2018-03-31 21:59:04 You can definitely use it since it's a 'drying' oil. I can see you found that one tutorial. It does definitely work, and you don't need terribly much of it.
4028 2018-03-31 21:58:58 my trip to Walmart to get a simple oil change was pretty fucken interesting 
4029 2018-03-31 21:58:52 Lucky summer is upon us and people’s oil needs are lower

4044 2018-03-31 21:56:40 OOOOO I'm excited! I think I read to use flaxseed oil?
4045 2018-03-31 21:56:29 Actually that oil belongs to Syria and Syrians and we have business of being in their country.
4046 2018-03-31 21:56:25 Imagine if you were smell or cream texture sensitive and someone smeared you in essential oil? 
4047 2018-03-31 21:56:19 I don't know much about this mob the Saudi's. Apart from the fact if oil was superseded by different power source. This mob would just have a huge sand bunker to live on. No one would visit, and they would have no US support. What the hell is he wearing? Do they grab a curtain?

4056 2018-03-31 21:54:37 I have switched to coconut oil and it seems to taste better. I read it has a higher fat content then butter hence retains more of the good stuff.
4057 2018-03-31 21:54:20 coincidentally, just what major oil producer Russia wants
4058 2018-03-31 21:54:04 Democrats have never loved our Country. They think that we are evil people that owned Slaves and started wars for oil, which I have never seen us take any oil in all of our victories.

I'm guessing why everyday masks & exfoliating doesn't damage & leave my skin sensitive.

For all these mentioned masks check Garnier & for the tea tree oil check at The Body Shop

4075 2018-03-31 21:49:48 I changed the oil and filter on my Hustler Sport.  Need to top the air and get it started to clean the yard up.
4076 2018-03-31 21:49:41 It legitimately bothers me that oil and water wont mix
4077 2018-03-31 21:49:27 I used to wash mine every 2-3 days, but now I can make it a week easily without much visible oil build-up.
4078 2018-03-31 21:49:25 Many people who claim that global warming is fake use  evidence that climate scientists are in it for the money and are being paid for their results. However, there are MANY other industries that they could maximize profit it in, including the oil industry. #climatemyth #ees028

4080 2018-03-31 21:48:55 Your comment highlights the problem, which is ignorance of this province.  99% of exported Canadian Oil is already to the US.  Alberta with 100% the Corp, personal tax revenue would have an incredibly robust economy.

4084 2018-03-31 21:48:48 This can only mean one thing....COFFEE IS GOOD FOR YOU!

Canola oil is toxic because of the way it's heated & processed... 
Where's the warning?
Nuts in the U.S. are toxic because of the way they are pasturized & processed... Warning?

4088 2018-03-31 21:48:34 I know this, It sounds like my own history, but I blame the oil companies and the Alberta Conservative government for the mismanagement of the cyclical, seasonal, short term oil price, uncertainty of the industry.

4107 2018-03-31 21:45:52 Forgive me for my lack of understanding but are you making these as simple meshes and then painting onto them directly in Blender, including the lighting, so like a 3D oil painting?  They are really lovely.
4108 2018-03-31 21:45:50 Clay/charcoal mask (absorbs oil & smoothens)
& I add lemon juice (clears dark marks)
Every morning until I let my face steam while I bath/shower, then rinse it off with cold water. 

Idk if it's actually good to exfoliate everyday, but it has helped with scaring and uneven tone
4109 2018-03-31 21:45:46 First of all Gray Goose is so much better for aches and pains. And before the bath salts you need a 80 minute hot stone, warm oil full body massage. While you listen to Dark Side of the Moon in Bose’ noise cancelling headphones..... 

I’ve thought about this a lot

4136 2018-03-31 21:41:48 This is because they sold our country to Saudi back in 1973 and again in the 1990s and in that they promised the recognition of sharia law.....but NOT child rape or terrorism...so why do they not say UP YOURS..to this agreement.  They are running out of oil!

4215 2018-03-31 21:28:17 In Unprecedented Move, China Plans To Pay For Oil Imports With Yuan Instead Of Dollars
4216 2018-03-31 21:28:03 Wash. Clean inside out. Take to mechanic. Go get the oil changes. Put gas in the car. All I wanna do is get in it and drive.
4217 2018-03-31 21:27:52 Every time I come to get an oil change the mechanic always telling something else wrong. Look sir if I can’t hear or see the problem, it’s fine.
4218 2018-03-31 21:27:43 Do not worry your foot will get better soon and it will be the same Dear use a few dates with some oil Then make it warm a little in a spoon and then place it on the place of pain It will help you heal

4220 2018-03-31 21:27:19 I’ll be there pal. I’ll have the towel and olbas oil for you. 
4221 2018-03-31 21:26:55 Lift up ya whole hood like you got oil under it
4222 2018-03-31 21:26:07 Make sure to hand-wash your clothes if you think you have poison oak, and don’t mix them in with any other laundry. Urushiol, the irritating oil, has an annoying habit of spreading through laundry loads: I learned this the hard way.
4223 2018-03-31 21:25:58 1) I have no idea what Shell has to do with regulations being imposed by Trudeau Gov
2) "Leaking gasses into atmosphere prevents pollution." - what in the world are you trying to say?
3) Regulations imposing billions of $ in costs to Canadian oil but not foreign oil is excessive.
4224 2018-03-31 21:25:58 None of that in any particular order. Although changing my oil after or while drinking does sound interesting. But no worries I'm not driving afterwards if it does go down like that. I'm not a firm believer in drinking and driving.
4225 2018-03-31 21:25:41 Oil of cloves or whiskey soaked in cotton wool will ease the pain xxx
4226 2018-03-31 21:25:37 Poland - heavy manufacturing

4231 2018-03-31 21:24:39 I remember corruption. I remember an EU Commissioner who became Labour hero & for whom the commissioner was changed so he could get off. I remember an oil scandal which seems to have died & one of the accused hosted @JosephMuscat_JM at his premises recently. No surprise it died.

4233 2018-03-31 21:24:21 Isn't it ironic that one of the original developers of the oil sands was Pew grandfather. Now Pew foundation gives millions to environmental activists to discredit oil amongst other resource industries.
4234 2018-03-31 21:24:21 Mens one a day and fish oil every day

4235 2018-03-31 21:23:59 She just got it done and knew @MadnessOverlord is guilt over the situation so she didn't ask and let it be while wiping her hands off from oil and such. Good thing she also able cover his parts properly with good items parts and tools. "You can test, and take your time."

4239 2018-03-31 21:23:00 There is an old fishing house on the point that has been preserved and is part of a park now. Its pretty nifty, you can still smell the whale oil they used in the lamps and can see when there is a big school of fish coming in.
4240 2018-03-31 21:22:22 Maybe @davidhogg111 remembers?  Maybe he’s too busy in his political maneuvers to care?
4241 2018-03-31 21:22:15 Green tea in the sauce/oil? :o
4242 2018-03-31 21:22:10 Rogin can't be this stupid.  He must be attempting to dupe Trump about Syrian oil.  Iran isn't seeking Syrian oil as it has its own humongous oil reserves.  Syrian oil is relatively small & will be developed by Russia.

4277 2018-03-31 21:16:22 I'm getting an oil change and at this place you sit in the car while they do it. So I'm actively aware that the only thing between me and a hole in the floor is the bottom of my car.  It's freaking me out.
4278 2018-03-31 21:16:03 Oil and wise and be careful

4286 2018-03-31 21:14:23 My skin has been so bad lately and I can’t figure out why. I wash with acne face cleanser daily. I use oil free moisturizer. I hardly ever wear makeup. But here I am, a 30 year old pizza face.
4287 2018-03-31 21:13:53 This jojoba oil got your boy out here shinin breh. Skin on a hunnid doe.
4288 2018-03-31 21:13:32 It's exactly the opposite. The point is that they put no effort into it at all and just make stuff up and appeal to emotion.
4289 2018-03-31 21:13:24 The Labour Party’s deception on WMD’s pushed the price of oil up.
4290 2018-03-31 21:13:22 Coconut oil has a shelf life of 18 months...according to my friend
4291 2018-03-31 21:13:19 AHHH i’m getting an oil change with my dad and someone just asked if I was his girlfriend

4294 2018-03-31 21:12:24 I understand that pain, it like how hot oil got on me when I was trying to get some chicken.
4295 2018-03-31 21:12:20 What I don't like about the book is that it encapsulated me until I realized that there was no technology that wld end oil spil
4296 2018-03-31 21:12:19 - is still processed from crude oil.
4297 2018-03-31 21:12:11 A short term contract after this one is done!!  Lol.

4300 2018-03-31 21:12:07 They need to create jobs!
The Saudi sand storms will keep many busy cleaning panels, it's a full time job.  And they can sell more oil.
4301 2018-03-31 21:12:05 Hemp oil also works!
4302 2018-03-31 21:11:38 Oil change for $20. Just buy the stuff and bring it to me.

4304 2018-03-31 21:11:21 What a great job done by federal government , price of oil in international market arround 67$ where as reduce in petrol price just Rs 2.7paisa . Government functioneries least pushed because even their private vehicles gets Sarkari Fuel.
4305 2018-03-31 21:11:19 I’m ready to leave this baby shower but I honestly don’t think I can go get my oil changed by myself
4306 2018-03-31 21:11:13 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
4307 2018-03-31 21:11:05 As an Oklahoman, this is terrifying. Our leaders are owned by the oil and gas industry.
4308 2018-03-31 21:11:02 all I need is doterra oregano oil and I will win for sure
4309 2018-03-31 21:10:59 True...so...as I said - our current anthropogenic ways are killing biodiversity - then we add to it some more with turbines and panels...
We are going to always need oil (even if all cars are battery powered), the machines needed in production need oil, and even synthetic oil -
4310 2018-03-31 21:10:55 My mom's recipes call for a 'glorp' of oil.
4311 2018-03-31 21:10:25 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!

4312 2018-03-31 21:10:20 You missed that the US and Canada now have more oil than they need due to frakking. Why should anyone buy Oil from Venezuela now?
4313 2018-03-31 21:10:19 China doesn’t allow gold to leave the mainland. It’s not a real oil for gold trade nor will it ever be.
4314 2018-03-31 21:10:15 My mom paid for my oil change, groceries, and chipotle today....I need to figure out what she’s up to

4319 2018-03-31 21:09:20 So Rogin blatantly admits that oil is the reason we are in Syria. So much for your holier than thou humanitarian charade.
4320 2018-03-31 21:09:10 It's his oil change. Give him a break.
4321 2018-03-31 21:09:02 At least this lackey is honest (or stupid) enough to tell the truth: American intervention in Syria was never about democracy, or the war on terror. It was always about oil - and Israel.
4322 2018-03-31 21:08:17 We're up 2nd on #MOTD after the Ev have a non consensual act performed on them by the oil smurfs. 20 minutes.
4323 2018-03-31 21:08:16 Okay I did this for a month and my natural curls started looking so much better. You should get some castor oil.
4324 2018-03-31 21:08:11 Non sequitur? You mean like expanding the use of oil and gas will help reduce the impact of oil and gas? Those people at the fence gain nothing by being there. They are sacrificing their time, energy and potentially freedom because they care about the environment that sustains us
4325 2018-03-31 21:08:02 did I miss something? Oil is still the one of the most valuable commodities in the world.
4326 2018-03-31 21:07:57 I swear going to get an oil change is annoying. Stop trying to add stuff I didn't ask for!
4327 2018-03-31 21:07:49 Coconut oil.
4328 2018-03-31 21:07:40 In studies, prolonged the lives of rats that should've lived only 3 yrs, kept their organs youthful. They were euthanized because they wouldn't die and the study needed to finish.

4335 2018-03-31 21:06:36 At least that's something. Look, the CIA is probably in there as well, but not as the cause. They just always stir up shit when there's trouble. Their economy failed because it is only based on raw oil, which managed to pay for all the social policies when the price was high
4336 2018-03-31 21:06:28 Of course "Oil Tot" is my biggest fan. He's a great friend, an excellent streamer. he's very "Teddy Bear" cute, his British voice/singing voice are both top notch! There's plenty to love about Josh "Oil Tot" Middleton! And plenty of love he's going to continue to get!

4342 2018-03-31 21:05:13 Get some of your school chums round, a couple of renditions of the Horst Wessel Lied like the good old days and let that cognitive dissonance reverberate around the place. Keep despising the thing you had endless opportunity to influence, you toad-faced snake oil merchant.
4343 2018-03-31 21:05:02 Yeah, discount the other countries that don't sit on a lot of oil.  Also, notice they are mostly more socialistic than we are.
4344 2018-03-31 21:05:00 Atlas Mountains, Berbers, argan oil, waterfalls, an exercise in blind trust, orange juice in the skies and Kasbah Tamadot (and Moroccan bubbly, of course)... more to come

4358 2018-03-31 21:02:28 This is soooo cute oil bear
4359 2018-03-31 21:02:20 Anyway this is a distraction from the main issue. And that is that Greens have given their questions to a party that was actively looking to drill National Park in Te Anau for oil & gas.
4360 2018-03-31 21:01:43 I need an oil change, more envelopes & gas
4361 2018-03-31 21:01:42 Im waiting for my oil change and this guy won’t stop making small talk —I know where this is going 
4362 2018-03-31 21:01:34 Shout out to @oakandadze where Caleb hooked me up with some beard oil
4363 2018-03-31 21:01:34 So you are basically admitting that you are only there for the oil????? You really do need to be careful of your wording!!!!!
4364 2018-03-31 21:01:33 Soda bread would soak up too much oil but sourdough crumbs work very well
4365 2018-03-31 21:01:31 Lol, I meant Oil the minister
4366 2018-03-31 21:01:29 No, but it’s notable that Sarah Smith dropped her tedious “the oil situation drives a coach & horses through the case for independence, doesn’t it’ mantra a long time back.
4367 2018-03-31 21:00:46 Just washed my car and changed the oil too. Is t weird that car work on a Sunday afternoon is kinda relaxing to me? 
4368 2018-03-31 21:00:44 Deepwater Oil Starting to Hold its Own With Shale, Chevron Says
4369 2018-03-31 21:00:41 Y'all, my big queer Discord server just came up with the best way to defund the NRA, destroy oil companies, and ruin capitalist oligarchies: convince the TERFs trans femmes love that ish.
4370 2018-03-31 21:00:36 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this April? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.
4371 2018-03-31 21:00:31 No rush.  I’m going back to work on April 9th.  I won’t be home until the beginning of May.  The oil must flow!
4372 2018-03-31 21:00:23 To be clear, this is afield of oil trading.  I'll summarize: If I controlled enough of the phys oil & phys gold markets, I could control the international trade value of the USD.  If a guy in Cleveland understands this, IMO it strains credulity this is not understood in China.
4373 2018-03-31 21:00:22 Kermit the Frog has said it’s not easy being green and the same can be said for the Green Party leader. Enviro’s expect her to attack dirty oil while the Canadian public expects those in office to uphold the law. May made her choice and will be judged by it.
4374 2018-03-31 21:00:14 March 31, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4375 2018-03-31 20:59:36 Again, the problem actually lies with faulty clinical understanding. If your car goes in to replace a flat tyre and the mechanic finds an incidental leak of engine oil, do you ignore it because it wasn’t the clinical problem?
4376 2018-03-31 20:59:26 TTC wasting fuel oil more & more unnecessary & specially holiday season & public suffering, Toronto Transit Commission, & fuel oil prices increase unexpected ways CD$ 129.0, & CA$ sharply down ward, really what is going on? In Toronto City?
4377 2018-03-31 20:59:26 Oil لل vape #البنات_محتاجه_ايه
4378 2018-03-31 20:59:23 I came to get an oil change & they're literally making carne asada inside the shop.
4379 2018-03-31 20:59:15 "Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not..." ~Psalms 141:5
4380 2018-03-31 20:58:56 Mmm can I come oil you up?
4381 2018-03-31 20:58:44 What did I do today? I paid my cell, car, couch, PECO, Best Buy, internet AND oil. SO MANY MORE TO GO AND PAY  #idontlikeadulting #ihatebills

4383 2018-03-31 20:58:29 My grandpa told me to make sure my car was good before driving to Ohio tomorrow. I took it to the car wash and vacuumed it out. Apparently he meant check the oil and tire pressure. 
4384 2018-03-31 20:58:28 went to get my oil changed today and there was a guy with a hoodie FULL CONFEDERATE FLAG printed on the whole damn thing. whatever....the thing that really grinded my gears was when he was done smoking his nasty cigarette he just flung it on the ground!!!!!!!! WTF
4385 2018-03-31 20:58:26 Yes, the railroads and the oil companies during the 19th century also claimed like Silicon Valley has that they were "improving life and society" when they weren't. Same goes for Bell Telephone/AT&T. Keyword: eminent domain.
4386 2018-03-31 20:58:18 Get some water and peppermint oil in a spray bottle, shake it good so the oil is diluted, and spray the screen part. They hate the smell. Or buy minty plants for a garden or in your home
4387 2018-03-31 20:58:07 Get a bottle of almond oil and you can use it on face hair and body. Leaves you glowing ++ it’s all natural
4388 2018-03-31 20:57:59 Against my advice my cousin gave his car to a friend to go home for a weekend. Now the car has dents, an oil leak and rims bent for whatever reason. Now I have to listen to him whine about the car everyday. I have to excercise so much restraint so i don't tell him I told you so.
4389 2018-03-31 20:57:58 But I'm being honest hy you just can't mix water with oil,ayihlangani never
4390 2018-03-31 20:57:45 All the more reason we need to wean ourselves off oil dependence.
4391 2018-03-31 20:57:42 Every time one of @inagarten ‘s recipes calls for *good* olive oil, I look at the bottle I’m going to use and whisper “I’m so sorry...” #prettysureTheContessawouldnotapprove
4392 2018-03-31 20:57:38 Putin wants to keep ASSAD in place for the oil.
4393 2018-03-31 20:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4394 2018-03-31 20:57:28 No, is it #vegan, are the chips cooked in fat or oil? Will explain when I see you
4395 2018-03-31 20:57:10 Is baby oil made the same way that olive oil is made?
4396 2018-03-31 20:57:05 What’s more interesting than Norway is Finland’s place at no.1.  A country without Norway’s oil fund and in very close proximity to Russia.
4397 2018-03-31 20:56:52 coconut oil and highlight are the only 2 things touching my face lately
4398 2018-03-31 20:56:29 So I recently tried CBD oil. I'm a cannabis user and was curious about the benefits of CBD.
4399 2018-03-31 20:56:27 Try tea tree oil.
4400 2018-03-31 20:56:10 You are not supposed to substitute 2stroke oil with cooking oil  lol
4401 2018-03-31 20:56:07 That’s terrible allergy, don’t try managing the oil, stay away from it completely
4402 2018-03-31 20:55:57 @puniballs I still have no idea where to get mineral oil
4403 2018-03-31 20:55:57 Oil v Flames is a 4pt game for the #isles tonight. Go Oil Go

4405 2018-03-31 20:55:42 Body oil called black woman is my favorite.
4406 2018-03-31 20:55:37 This is now my reality as well and it’s really tricky. Thank god for garlic oil but I miss my favorite seasoning salt and pretty much a million other things garlic and onion powder are hiding in
4407 2018-03-31 20:55:13 So u too listen to this radio political programs,I miss kano
4408 2018-03-31 20:55:08 Calling a halt to US tankers, are you? Or do you only obstruct Canadian oil?
4409 2018-03-31 20:55:04 I tried cbd oil last night and again this morning. It's crazy what a difference it made.
4410 2018-03-31 20:54:49 Do you ever stop spewing Bipartisan bullshit? I highly doubt Iran needs any of Syria's oil because they have their own reserves on top of owning the largest Natural Gas deposit jointly with Qatar.

You are nothing more than a beggar for Interventionism.
4411 2018-03-31 20:54:44 #Energy101
The oil not supplied by Canada will gladly be supplied by other countries with possibly worse environmental standards.
4412 2018-03-31 20:54:16 This is a legit amazing lesson. I started using coconut oil & now ppl ask me abt my skin all the time. Cheap, easy and you can cook with it too!
4413 2018-03-31 20:54:06 No place to even buy new oil tonight
4414 2018-03-31 20:53:43 There are American interests that want us to fight , keeps our oil cheap for them .

4416 2018-03-31 20:53:23 Everytime I go get my oil change they think my car a newer model lol
4417 2018-03-31 20:53:19 I'm pretty sure it is....it's the one with the really good opening followed by fuck all else except that scene and loads of close-ups of Daniel Craig looking like an angry potato as someone talks about oil. A lot. It's not Bond's finest hour.
4418 2018-03-31 20:53:10 Just spit out the CBD oil that was in my mouth because I thought I saw a spider and it startled me  there was just cbd oil all over my chin
4419 2018-03-31 20:52:58 Exactly it was the greed of the oil industry that caused the crash in oil
4420 2018-03-31 20:52:53 Rahul Gandhi, dukandaar se :

4421 2018-03-31 20:52:46 Agreed.  So if you were a sovereign power who knew a key pillar of support for the USD were it's highly-levered commodity derivative markets (esp in gold & oil) one way "kick out" those pillars would be to 1) ctrl the phys gold mkt (check) & then 2) ctrl the phys oil mkt, no?
4422 2018-03-31 20:52:45 And wine that make glad the heart of man,&oil to make his face to shine,& bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

4423 2018-03-31 20:52:39 Miguna doesn't know how to choose his battles, he waging war on multiple fronts from Uhuru to Raila, now he is fighting the UAE govt, and accusing them of planning to kill him, Dubai is untouchable, those guys won't be kind to him, super powers bow to their oil and wealth

4425 2018-03-31 20:52:34 Yes, a lot of restaurants are happy to prepare something off the menu. We always check on the type of oil they use.
4426 2018-03-31 20:52:18 @slammmy__ Barcelona spoil my money...herh I want drink engine oil 
4427 2018-03-31 20:52:16 Search :Golan Heights +oil + Rothschild. It will become clearer
4428 2018-03-31 20:52:08 Coconut oil, vanilla candles, cinnamon bath & I'm in love. 
4429 2018-03-31 20:51:20 Avoid any lotions with mineral oil, I heard that’s what clogs pores!!
4430 2018-03-31 20:51:19 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
4431 2018-03-31 20:51:00 Die Nachfolgefirmen von Standard Oil und die Baby Bells hatten zusammen mehr Marktmacht als das zerschlagene Unternehmen.  Ein Netzwerk wie FB tendiert ohnehin zum Monopol.
4432 2018-03-31 20:50:57 Talks fast but says nothing worth hearing. Would be great snake oil salesman.
4433 2018-03-31 20:50:55 If “we” you aren’t part of the team you plastic fan. If it wasn’t for oil money you’d still be in championship
4434 2018-03-31 20:50:21 Most beautiful state I've ever lived in. #TrumpCrimeFamily trying to make sure the beautiful coastlines are lined with offshore oil drilling
4435 2018-03-31 20:50:14 or coconut oil
4436 2018-03-31 20:49:54 English/European colonialism has fucked up many many countries. Look at Africa, people are still fighting over borders drawn by European colonists less than 100 years ago. The US has destabilized the entire middle East for oil. The US TRAINED ISIS LEADERS
4437 2018-03-31 20:49:54 Gonna grill some salmon and some shrimp, but I’m not sure how I’ll season it. We usually do a tomato/garlic/green onion/olive oil mix and foil pack it.
4438 2018-03-31 20:49:51 Gross creepy disreputable perverted sicko stalker. But by all means please keep trying to hawk your, in my opinion, bullshit snake oil services. Whenever you’re involved, you seem to make things worse for the dummies paying you to get them outta trouble.
4439 2018-03-31 20:49:33 Scott Pruitt was the most Crooked Attorney General the state of Okla ever saw! Refused to uphold court rulings against Big Oil & Corp! He received huge donations from each family member! Refused to enforce anti-pollution, allowed well waste Inject which caused Earth Quakes!
4440 2018-03-31 20:49:13 I would put ya on the spot where ya could get the Amber White oil from but I don't want everybody smelling like me lol
4441 2018-03-31 20:49:11 It's always someone else's fault. Never mind that Ven's economy was only propped up by the oilprice, wvich then crashed after the saudis flooded the market to hurt russia and prevent the US and Canada from frakking. Which they did anyway and are now independant from the ME on oil
4442 2018-03-31 20:49:10 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
4443 2018-03-31 20:49:03 It happens, I know some people who don’t even want the palm oil self
4444 2018-03-31 20:49:02 @RockOilNews Do you have oil for Generators
4445 2018-03-31 20:48:31 ny times says ....eating fish good , fish oil maybe not.
4446 2018-03-31 20:48:24 @wetnwildbeauty Wet N Wild Makeup Remover Towelettes i was impressed with this. Ive never used wipe removals. I use typically soap and water or baby oil but i wont be going back to those LOL! Great flower smell and didnt leave a weird film on skin

4448 2018-03-31 20:47:52 I swear KDB is the first City player to have ever reached 20 assists in a season, in the club history 

The power of oil money 
4449 2018-03-31 20:47:45 Ever been to the middle east?  There's a lot more than oil going on there..  They diversified their economies because they know when the oil is going to run out & planned ahead.  My pretty face isn't worried at all.  I don't expect the USA to be #1 in everything all the time.
4450 2018-03-31 20:47:34 Less than three weeks to go and I am refactoring code only after 1.5 challenges have been coded. I am so dead in the water right now! #PiWars Time to burn the midnight oil!!
4451 2018-03-31 20:47:30 I think this will change with peak oil and global ecologic crisis 
4452 2018-03-31 20:47:28 Destabilizing a foreign nation for oil is basically the same as topping.
4453 2018-03-31 20:47:23 Yo this Amber White scented oil I got .. damn I love this smell
4454 2018-03-31 20:46:57 Breakfast well brunch lol was great.. got my oil changed.. now idk what I’m about to do until later
4455 2018-03-31 20:46:54 When you pay $10 for a carwash before you get your oil changed, then the car dealership washes it for free right after, as a courtesy. 
4456 2018-03-31 20:46:51 That's simply a lie. Hovis costs more than it did. Petrol has come down because global oil prices have massively reduced from the $120/barrel peak. And council tax didn't rise 20% a year (112%/12 years is <10%/yr). You're just telling lies.
4457 2018-03-31 20:46:50 Chef Kawasaki cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with Play-Doh.
4458 2018-03-31 20:46:43 Engy, even you? 

Haba, oil can't be your problem except you are talking of 'crude oil'.
4459 2018-03-31 20:46:41 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
4460 2018-03-31 20:46:36 They were discussing oil and gas business and he dare not disclose the business

4468 2018-03-31 20:45:21 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
4469 2018-03-31 20:45:05 Maybe if you can get a never <1$ guarantee at the bar, you could try one of those exclusivity contracts from left or right? I'm curious to see how those work.
PS I personally upgrade pipes when the oil pocket is decent, bc you get the bonus if you are able to end early.

4470 2018-03-31 20:44:24 I wish I had someone here to rub this oil on me while I fall asleep 
4471 2018-03-31 20:44:24 Content of the piece aside, what’s with the picture here? It’s like a photo editor said “we run too many pictures of tankers for oil stories” and some intern said “how about a guy just kind’ve looking at tankers?” and then people shrugged and just went with it
4472 2018-03-31 20:44:23 just tried oil. please don't.
4473 2018-03-31 20:43:41 In the US everything that’s told by the Gov is believed by the people like guns don’t kill its people - plausible deniability? Saddam had WMDs & linked to al Queda we didn’t want oil? PD? In the UK after Bliar the citizens demand facts & evidence in time truth prevails!!
4474 2018-03-31 20:43:40 Am I late?? 
I need that ZA oil 
4475 2018-03-31 20:43:31 . We are going to get it there . Massively adopted is the goal .  And the farther the dollar drops and inflation hits the easier it will be ....... which after watching china's oil trading last night using THEIR yaun i dont think it will be very long . 10 Billion in one hour!

4483 2018-03-31 20:42:27 Amazing stuff.  To read it makes it so relevant.  And to think the mighty USA at this time were feeding Nazi Germany oil and steel.  Wow.. It blows my mind.
4484 2018-03-31 20:42:26 Oh do share. What’s your secret. I’ve had most success with coconut oil based products.

4488 2018-03-31 20:42:04 Have you looked into CBD oil? It’s a derivation, concentrated liquid of cannabis, legal in most states. @nakedhealthy can you help this lady out and point her in the right direction? Let’s try to steer her towards some solutions.
4489 2018-03-31 20:41:38 looks like there is in fact, a fetanyl/benzo/benzene link or, chemical relationship. I was also poisoned with tainted naturals, proven by toxicology report full of things I don't know or do. Pharmaceutical and, oil industry, guilty.
4490 2018-03-31 20:41:30 Retweeted Adewunmi Emoruwa (@eadewunmi):

4502 2018-03-31 20:40:12 Im so spoiled my dad just paid for my oil change and put gas in my car :’)
4503 2018-03-31 20:40:00 Sounds more like favors for his real estate and building friends. Why would they need to be subsidized if they are being paid for providing a service already? Being in oil and construction myself, this is blatant favoritism and not capitalism.
4504 2018-03-31 20:39:58 living with italians has taught me many things, namely that olive oil quality actually makes a difference to the meaning of life
4505 2018-03-31 20:39:39 What zlatan can do, oil can do x10 better
4506 2018-03-31 20:39:37 now i gotta walk around with oil stain on my ass 
4507 2018-03-31 20:39:26 "In Syria, we ‘took the oil.’ Now Trump wants to give it to Iran" ... !  How great the WaPo is ... !  Like the NYTimes, and most of the Western Media, working, lying, deceiving, propaganting, cheating, ... for Israel and its wars ... !  !

4513 2018-03-31 20:38:40 She tries to make the bath fast trying to wash the sticky oil off him.
4514 2018-03-31 20:38:38 Like when I use to wash my face oil off every day instead of every second day. Fuck the haters mate, you doing good tilts them more.
4515 2018-03-31 20:38:26 Miracle looking like an oil Mogul who came out to flex #BBNaija
4516 2018-03-31 20:38:24 Nah...my food had to be prepared separately with palm oil
4517 2018-03-31 20:38:20 I try not touching them but they won’t grow! I’ve heard about castor oil, I’m gonna try it because drawing them in is soooo annoying!
4518 2018-03-31 20:38:14 Sometimes I make low carb bread and make sandwiches and I also coconut oil bites throughout the day to up the fat macros
4519 2018-03-31 20:38:06 Well bush was nice on camera but bombed thousands of civilians and families for oil .

4532 2018-03-31 20:36:29 If you see Leaking hydraulic fluid or oil by another mower. Then you whip the tennis ball at said culprits head as hard as you can. Mowers are trained to stop when they see this
4533 2018-03-31 20:36:29 Portugal has vehilcles and electrical machinery. Sweden has cars, crude oil, automobile parts. Malta has electrical machinery, equipment, pharmaceuticals & mineral fuels including oil.
4534 2018-03-31 20:36:20 A recent study showed that young boys regularly exposed to lavender oil had a higher chance of developing breasts.
4535 2018-03-31 20:36:07 If you could switch from your expensive, toxic #bloodpressure meds to a daily oil, pressed from a plant, would you?

4537 2018-03-31 20:35:52 History will remember you as one of the great humans. Although I work in the oil industry as a blue collar even I see that change is imminent and will support you Sir to the end. God bless!
4538 2018-03-31 20:35:43 Elections, hoping to ride the Gravy Train. I think the Gravy Train has run off the tracks. Most Albertan's don't seem to comprehend that oil is a commodity that is determined by events around the world, that determine the Price. Hence, THEY WHINE.
4539 2018-03-31 20:35:37 I just finished cooking. And scrubbing the hell out of a damn pot. I put oil in the pot when I make green banana but that residue still a bitch to get out.
4540 2018-03-31 20:35:34 Groundnut chin chin puff puff fried plantain, butter anything that has to do with oil
4541 2018-03-31 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
4542 2018-03-31 20:35:11 I'm really waiting 2 hrs for an oil change. this is ridiculous.
4543 2018-03-31 20:35:01 Weird that I unfollowed Young Living and then like 12 essential oil pages decided to follow me..... hmm
4544 2018-03-31 20:34:57 u make nothing or lose $$but get tax&oil burn,petro $ scam, wear out roads more debt elite enslavement, more usa job destruction&as a% of sale price highest tax poss shipping fees+post office gets bill ie tax payers more debt too,satanic 3d chess.

4546 2018-03-31 20:34:49 I don't believe you, and if there is such a comment it may well have been made at a much earlier time in Trudeau's life. And the oil sands? Well, I hate to tell 'ya, but a large number of Canadians would like it to stay in the ground. However, we support Alberta's need for it now
4547 2018-03-31 20:34:45 Homeopathy and reiki can lead to a placebo effect but really that does not make them benign, think delayed effective treatment for serious conditions and the lining of charletons pockets. The difficulty with essential oils can be seen in lavender oil, for example.1
4548 2018-03-31 20:34:42 Down with things like Ranger IPA. So much hops, you can almost feel the oil on your teeth after drinking.
4549 2018-03-31 20:34:38 This time its for oil
4550 2018-03-31 20:34:27 Yes, fine, but guess what? US as a major producer does better with higher prices now and has become an exporter of crude again. Saudis tried to kill off North American production with price cuts of 2014-16. Can't simple equate presence with oil stability/protection.
4551 2018-03-31 20:34:27 That was actually for the fight against terrorism; not oil. Check your facts, Craig.
4552 2018-03-31 20:34:13 Don’t wear make up because it’ll stress your pores out. Try different makeup products. Go natural for a bit. Put moisturizer on, coconut oil, lotion (nonscented)
4553 2018-03-31 20:34:07 i didn't have formaldehyde so i saved it in olive oil

4557 2018-03-31 20:33:30 Demand is increasing due to more autos, trucks, and even BC Ferries ships. KM pipeline can solve some of the supply side issues as it can ship many different oil products using batching
4558 2018-03-31 20:33:27 The bunny came in off the oil 
4559 2018-03-31 20:33:08 Ever want to bathe in “stress away” oil?
4560 2018-03-31 20:32:57 I'm a life long Albertan. You are Correct. It's the right wing nut jobs that are doing all of the whining, and they are a minority, but because of the voting districts they are over represented. The domination of the oil bizz, results in Alberta voting Conservative in Federal>
4561 2018-03-31 20:32:47 Because Apple is the only country in the business of murdering people and stealing their oil!
4562 2018-03-31 20:32:08 We just found out that my car didn’t have any oil in it. Which tire it up.
4563 2018-03-31 20:32:08 My Saturday nights consist of me, chilling in a onesie and wearing my specs, face full of coconut oil and face cream plus an entire can full of speckled eggs...Ya.. it ain't that exciting

4567 2018-03-31 20:31:17 Have you ever noticed strange smells like oil or fuel that burns your eyes or gives you a nice headache,  that's the jet engine " breathing " past carbon seals or knife edge air seals into the environmental systems , rarely fixed until a phase inspection , comforting ?
4568 2018-03-31 20:31:08 I'm guessing the oil companies aren't helping out.
4569 2018-03-31 20:31:03 I sound very stupid when I tell people I used to be allergic to groundnut oil and I’m not actually totally free from it
4570 2018-03-31 20:30:57 They should look to cbd oil. Unfortunately, the system doesn't work. Although the people do.

4573 2018-03-31 20:30:43 Indian Oil Corp plans to invest 1.43 trillion rupees ($22 billion) in next five years as the country's top refiner seeks to raise its annual capacity to about 3.2 million barrels per day by 2030.

4575 2018-03-31 20:30:34 I made it. Sugar, coconut oil, and honey. 4 table spoons sugar, 2 table spoons of coconut oil, and 3 tsp of honey. Mix it all together and enjoy. Only use it for lips though the coconut oil will clog your pores if you put it on your face
4576 2018-03-31 20:30:24 My favorite snack has to be Italian bread with olive oil and salt
4577 2018-03-31 20:30:10 The feeling of an oil change and full tank ...

4582 2018-03-31 20:29:10 You mean ‘oil producers’ not ‘energy producers’. Energy producers also include wind, solar and other renewable sources. Your focus should be the environment not oil producers, you need remedial education on your job, heir profits are not your concern. You’re a crook.
4583 2018-03-31 20:29:08 There is no 4...all these derivates that are manipulating the price...are temporary...when the IMF starts putting SDRs in actual commodities...the dollar derivates market will lose its grip on btc, gold, oil, etc...its a hodl

4594 2018-03-31 20:27:27 You seem to assume Syria’s oil belongs to the US & not Syria. Go home & mind your own business.
4595 2018-03-31 20:27:24 No problem, just raise the price of a barrel of oil 10 cents and they get that cash back tomorrow.
4596 2018-03-31 20:27:18 You steal land, water, oil and gas from the illegally occupied territories. You illegally build illegal settlements in the West Bank.
4597 2018-03-31 20:27:08 Please explain what's going to happen when leftist governments destroy our oil and gas sector. Investment dollars already fleeing. You want to buy our oil from the Middle East and shut ours down.

4620 2018-03-31 20:23:39 Having read, watched and listened to so much from so many people I am shocked at just how mindblowingly corrupt the whole world is, and how our country, without our permission, sold our country and its future to Saudi in 1973 for oil and a work force (what a joke)! Heartbreaking!
4621 2018-03-31 20:23:39 Drink water. Lather yourself in coconut oil. Treat your natural hair well. Get your nails done. Read a book. Start a business. Mind yours.

4626 2018-03-31 20:22:29 Precisely. But reading about the school, I gather they have rights and wrongs. Aside from using long grain rice, I'm not sure there are too many. An idiot Scotsman food  critic once chided a place for not using arborio!

4631 2018-03-31 20:21:58 Please tell me how Trump's America first policies help Russia in any way? Trump is building up the military again and USA is drilling for oil on US lands more than ever before. This helps Russia how?

4633 2018-03-31 20:21:36 He has wasted Taxpayers for the past year, and worked only to attack the environment for Big oil. I’m at a loss to understand why he still has a job, oh I remember now we have Trump in office and the GOP does nothing
4634 2018-03-31 20:21:20 I’m ok with way we are going Jon, 2 more windows and you will see a Mourinho team and we will be competing properly with oil F.C.
4635 2018-03-31 20:21:10 Sadly, that trend has continued till date, and the US has consistently defaulted on the side of her economic interest. Trump, making it very apparent is infact a good thing for the continent rather than the snake oil deception the Democrats were peddling.2/

4637 2018-03-31 20:20:48 LOL gas prices follow the price of a barrel of oil. The oil companies make money from producing oil, not from gas pumps. This mostly affects the gas stations not oil companies
4638 2018-03-31 20:20:38 These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on Earth or on foreign planets. Usually I prefer a nude oil painting.

4642 2018-03-31 20:19:43 Correct, that is Cloud iridescence.  Cloud iridescence is the occurrence of colors in a cloud similar to those seen in oil films on puddles. It is a fairly common phenomenon, most often observed in altocumulus, cirrocumulus, lenticular clouds and cirrus clouds.

4648 2018-03-31 20:18:50 Yup, we'll use oil up until it's gone or prices has plummeted beyond threshold to bring it back up. AB do have a bit of head start on renewables so hopefully these new fields of energies will continue to be built on.

4650 2018-03-31 20:18:19 Matzo ballers: if I want to make fluffier balls with Manischewitz matzo ball mix, should I sub club soda for the vegetable oil?
4651 2018-03-31 20:17:33 5305F
4652 2018-03-31 20:17:32 I can only assume that stores putting condoms, lube and other sex products behind locked glass that requires management is meant to slut shame customers, but if you’re trying to embarrass me for buying motor oil for my trip down the one-handed highway, give up now.
4653 2018-03-31 20:17:28 Just sayin haha if i was home i would have given you a ride  even helped you with the oil change
4654 2018-03-31 20:17:27 When family honor can be tied to family oil wealth, no need to worry about other people, I guess.
4655 2018-03-31 20:17:24 Coconut oil on standby? :P
4656 2018-03-31 20:17:22 As Paella is the pan not the Food, there is no wrong way just guidance.  Same with minestrone as this is just an Italian vegetable soup. And stovies differ from region to region so all open to interpretation!
4657 2018-03-31 20:17:04 Not vacuous - just true - I was not buying what you were selling!  I am living in the real world.  I think you have been seduced by economic ‘snake oil salesmen’. And for the avoidance of doubt - I am ‘loving life’. Bye.
4658 2018-03-31 20:16:50 I keep hearing her name and am wondering why. She's not exactly an oil painting so what is her claim to fame? At least we know Chelsea Handler is a Trump-hating lover of golden showers. That's something, I guess.
4659 2018-03-31 20:16:38 $65 dollar oil now but what do we get, about $25 less per barrel. Many important projects and pipelines not done because of leftist policies. Yeah but it's a price and glut issue.
4660 2018-03-31 20:16:33 Went to the bathroom and just farted out pure oil. I think I have cystic fibrosis help.
4661 2018-03-31 20:16:13 I hate when nail techs on instagram dip their clients hands in a vat of canola oil when they take pictures of their nails smh
4662 2018-03-31 20:15:52 Thanks for this. Too bad you weren't able to offer anything of substance. Remember, Alberta is Canada's worst GHG emitter, all thanks to the oil and gas industry. It's Alberta that guarantees that Canada will not meet its Paris agreement targets, set by Stephen Harper.
4663 2018-03-31 20:15:13 Beat you too it. Whenever we see the names of the narcissistic Troika of Hogg, Gonzalez and Cameron Kasky MUST simply Reply (at least) PETER WANG, AARON FEIS AND ANTHONY BORGES.

4668 2018-03-31 20:14:29 He’s is snake oil. If BC was Slick Willie, I wonder what we should call 45? Film Flam?
4669 2018-03-31 20:14:21 Yeah, I'm sure it's a good engine in its own right. Not sure it'll feel great lugging a massive Tiguan up a hill, though. And GTE 1.4 is a very different beast. Want some power. Getting bored of my 140bhp oil burner

4675 2018-03-31 20:13:56 Collecting the sound of changing an oil filter with a candle burning, quickly
4676 2018-03-31 20:13:44 Yes, like in Portland, the gas tax helps fund public transit. Long term though, the piper is going to have to be paid. We are too dependent on oil. If not soon, when should the price of oil reflect the true short term and long term costs?
4677 2018-03-31 20:13:43 Loving Spain... Especially that wine is cheaper than olive oil!
4678 2018-03-31 20:13:36 Best kale recipe I’ve heard is to add some coconut oil to it as you fry it in a pan. 

Makes it much easier to scrape it into the trash.
4679 2018-03-31 20:13:31 Got some on order. I'll keep you posted. But friends swear by full spectrum cbd oil.
4680 2018-03-31 20:12:59 She pets him, "Its okay hunny. " She was prepared in shorts and black top. "You have to be cleaned up. You are covered in oil. This is then only way."
4681 2018-03-31 20:12:47 Can someone slip this woman some medicinal dose of medicinal cannabis oil so she can start her recovery from any potential brain damage she may have suffered ?
4682 2018-03-31 20:12:47 Ok so I just realised plastic dinosaurs are made from plastic which comes from oil which comes from fossils aka dinosaurs so plastic dinosaurs are literally made out of real dinosaurs oHmygOd

4687 2018-03-31 20:11:53 No, I'm calling you and the rest of the "ex-Muslims" that travel in racist far-right circles charlatans and snake oil peddlers. You tell the bigots what they want to hear and make a career out of it. I'm well familiar with your type.
4688 2018-03-31 20:11:50 Boarded this morning at 6:15am, then got to sit on the plane for two hours with no air conditioning while they changed the oil... thanks @Americanair
4689 2018-03-31 20:11:47 i know your history as soon as isis walked into iraq and we was told they stole the oil  do you know where that oil ended up israel thats nothing to do with kurds selling thier own oil thats the only market they had now i know your turkish defending the fact you have fat western

4692 2018-03-31 20:11:31 Interesting point; run that thought out.  As China's 1% "use the oil contract to get capital out", who ends up w/ a large % of the world's oil (China).  If a large % of the world's oil is suddenly priced in CNY, how much oil will be left to support WTI/Brent contracts?
4693 2018-03-31 20:11:30 a radio station here had a challenge and ran a car on syrup for oil and it didn't break down after 100 miles on a track.
4694 2018-03-31 20:11:19 I have fibromyalgia too, I have been on several lots of meds and none have worked, so I won't be giving CBD oil a try
4695 2018-03-31 20:11:10 I'm glad it helped!  Code signatures are snake oil a lot of the time.

4699 2018-03-31 20:10:48 Bless my step dad for being so nice and fixing my car . He was gonna just do an oil change and apparently everything is leaking and it’s basically dead 
4700 2018-03-31 20:10:46 Trudeau has been captured on film saying  that he thought Alberta has too much power and says the best leaders are from Quebec. His side kick Butt's is also on film and in writing that he wants oil Sands to stay in the ground. That's radical, fighting words to alberta, much more.
4701 2018-03-31 20:10:31 The cbd oil really made a huge difference!! Anxiety who???

4709 2018-03-31 20:09:58 China to buy oil in Petro/yuan. Significant event. Nations that will sell oil for Yuan: Russia, Angola, Iran, Venezuela. Others may: Iraq, Syria, Indonesia, Algeria, Syria, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil. Will US invade/bomb China, not likely. Severe economic confrontation inevitable.

4712 2018-03-31 20:09:36 Quick question, how do you cook your hotdogs? Do you put water or cooking oil?
4713 2018-03-31 20:09:21 Large pan, plenty of water, glug of oil, stirring every few minutes..... Still there 
4714 2018-03-31 20:08:42 Got lightheaded... Dirty pan, cigarettes... Bath tub with spices oil... What else left.
4715 2018-03-31 20:08:39 All wars are fought over god and oil.
4716 2018-03-31 20:08:37 Love when the oil changer comes out to show me the new oil on the dipstick as if to say "See, we really did it,  we're not lying."
4717 2018-03-31 20:08:21 Scott Pruitt sued the EPA approximately 16 times, he vowed to eliminate the EPA, so Trump put Pruitt in charge of our Nations environmental protections!

4723 2018-03-31 20:07:00 Showing the young are dumbest because they have no experience of socialism and fall for Corbyn's snake oil- that everyone can live at the expense of some other bloke.
4724 2018-03-31 20:06:58 And the US doesn't need Persian Gulf oil. So everyone who keeps saying the US only deploys troops to ensure access to oil needs a new narrative.

He doesn't want to keep sponsoring ISIS & Al Qaeda.
Iran has been in Syria for the longest by invitation!
They will be there forever. War for oil & for war profiteers have ruined The American Society!
4730 2018-03-31 20:06:27 The coordinated attack on DPRK or any other country with sanctions is just the free market at work?
4731 2018-03-31 20:06:17 discovering coconut oil will forever be the best thing thats ever happened to me
4732 2018-03-31 20:06:17 Apparently @realDonaldTrump and the #GOPCrimeSyndicate can market anything to their base, as well as any snake oil salesman.  If the lyin' GOP says the tax cuts will help, 40% of the population will believe it just because the lyin' GOP said it, and they want in the tribe.
4733 2018-03-31 20:05:33 "Better yet, just toss me into a vat of oil."

4739 2018-03-31 20:04:23 Yes, but only in "offshore" market - Shanghai gold int'l board (SGEI.)  also CNY gold in HK & Dubai.  Oil is 1st time foreigners allowed in onshore mkt.  Also, look at % of Chinese gold contracts settled in phys v COMEX/LBMA.  Hints at a different "world view" I've been told of

4751 2018-03-31 20:02:06 Yes and no. Love the idea of cooking as team building; however, reading about these guys, they seem to be a tad austere on how you make a paella. Seems as daft as saying your way is the only way to make minestrone or stovies.

Shawn: Gus please, that is disgusting.
Gus: What? A deep #Psych
4762 2018-03-31 20:00:00 To steal the oil? He just found out Syria only has less than 2 bil barrels.. Not even worth a very small war.. The largest oil field pumps 20,000 barrels a day.. Saudis and Iraqi;s dont even bother with such small fields.
4763 2018-03-31 19:59:56 Coconut oil!! Not flour. Lol.
4764 2018-03-31 19:59:28 and the left can say the same about denying someone healthcare. It's all subjective.

A lot of people don't view a fetus as a person.

What's ironic is most who are "pro-life" only care before they are born, but then want to cut social services and send them to die in oil wars

4774 2018-03-31 19:57:41 Told ya isnt it just the best! When you get home try putting some in the oven with olive oil and seasoning. Just as good
4775 2018-03-31 19:57:35 I would nominate Winters and Schnackenberg as climate change advisors solely because the last names make it seem credible. Then we sell out to big oil and medium coal.

4788 2018-03-31 19:55:22 That is one real test.  IMO the other real test is "What if China's goals for this contract is more about geopolitics & national security than giving specs one more commodity to whip around?"  After all, wars are not fought pork bellies or apples...they are fought over oil.
4789 2018-03-31 19:55:18 Absolutely right... At a time when life itself is threatened in so many areas, the oceans, bird/invertebrate populations, habitat loss, pollution from plastic/oil/pesticides WHY condone a 'sport' based on KILLING???
4790 2018-03-31 19:55:13 turkish oil wrestelr typically go right for the dick because it's the only place they don't apply oil, so you're actually giving him a combat advantage

Nah drop that bitch in oil ya heard
4794 2018-03-31 19:54:24 Smells like Murdoch and Genie Oil. Time to get it out of the ground hey Rupe? So hand Syria to Putin. Get the private military to protect other borders (assets).
4795 2018-03-31 19:53:58 And we love Moonbeam the Buddhist. We had GOP governors who PUT CA IN DEBT because that's what republicans do. Cause debt, joblessness, pollution, hate, racism and bad schools. GOP want oil derricks off our beautiful coast, oil spills on our beaches, our marine life dead.
4796 2018-03-31 19:53:44 The current "president" has colluded with Russia, bragged about grabbing pussies, has been less transparent than an oil slick but is currently ruling the land, black lady doesn't know she can vote get 5 years in prison #CrystalMason #ameriKKa

4807 2018-03-31 19:52:23 There is no good reason you, @sjmuir or anyone else, to convince us to allow 7 times more oil tankers out of Westridge simply for selling that oil to Asia for Alberta Oil Tax. There is simply too much and risk for us without any benefit whatsoever! #bcpoli #cdnpoli

4813 2018-03-31 19:51:38 We all work hard. But it's not Canada's that the Alberta conservatives pissed away billions in royalties to give tax breaks to Big Oil.
4814 2018-03-31 19:51:35 Ask someone to massage it with warm olive oil, it helps a lot
4815 2018-03-31 19:51:26 Love it when that ilk flat out admit they're supporting a war for oil instead of pretending to deny the accusation.

4818 2018-03-31 19:51:16 15 pitchers in 20ip, there's not enough coconut oil in the world to sustain that pace is there @howardeskin? If over-manager Gabe Kapler uses every single RP every 3 games don't they all kind of need to be perfect in their roles for us to win? Or don't those analytics apply here?
4819 2018-03-31 19:50:51 ion know about not using product, but brushing in the shower does work too. Personally, I’ve gotten better results from using curling cream, coconut oil and some kind of light oil for shine when I need it
4820 2018-03-31 19:50:46 Your clown show never ends. Governments don't ship oil. Oil in Canada is free-market capitalism controlled by multi-national corporations. They bring in the cheapest oil to their refineries to make the most profit. As a journalist, your lack of knowledge is astounding. #abpoli
4821 2018-03-31 19:50:31 That’s some gnarly oil 
4822 2018-03-31 19:49:54 If it was other way around and cons had power to shut down CNN you wouldn't be cheering this. I'm certain
4823 2018-03-31 19:49:38 Pick a bagful before it flowers. Chop finely and pack into jars. Pour on olive oil and you have garlic pesto! You can use it anything that you would normally use oil and garlic (everything almost). Keeps for a couple of years #veganrecipe
4824 2018-03-31 19:49:33 I also moisturized, sealed with almond oil and used sunscreen
4825 2018-03-31 19:49:21 Nor would he have a problem if Amazon sold oil and coal online: he hates companies that don't contribute to permanent dependence on fossil fuel and their producers--Texas, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

4830 2018-03-31 19:48:10 Other provinces don’t have huge oil revenue. We SHOULD be way ahead of all of them

4832 2018-03-31 19:47:58 Surprisingly the Peah and Chrozo hash! Wasn't sure about it but tasted great, first time with Egg on the Patatas Bravas which was also really nice. Mrs said the Chrizo needs to go back to a simpler dish, just on its own in oil with less dressing would be nicer

4836 2018-03-31 19:47:34 Yep. Life is too short for this sort of irrational anger and vitriol. 

I'm not living through pointless austerity again just so that oil companies get a bit richer.
4837 2018-03-31 19:47:27 Had the most fabulous purple sprouting broccoli tonight from @Riverford , steamed with a light dressing of olive oil, lemon juice and nutritional yeast flakes... oh yessss the spinach disappeared at breakfast  with poached eggs and unpasteurised butter...

4844 2018-03-31 19:46:45 So what if they've profited? Oil companies profit from pumping oil, but we should totally trust them? Your argument is ls ludicrous.
4845 2018-03-31 19:46:41 An Oiler win over Flames makes me forget four sub par games against other teams IMHO.  No reason to EVER lose against: Flames, Canucks, Leafs, Habs!  Finish strong Oil!

If you feel yourself capable of infiltrating an oil rig, then there /is/ that option.”
4868 2018-03-31 19:45:13 Alberta "let them freeze in the dark" isn't even original. It came from US oil industry dominated states in the '70s. I think we've been struggling with Canadian governments corrupted by oil corps for a long time. Conservatives = proxy? #cdnpoli "patriots" = traitors? #bcpoli

4875 2018-03-31 19:44:05 Agreed.  IMO China wants oil down in CNY, US wants it up in USD.  If both get their way, CNY must rise v USD.

4913 2018-03-31 19:39:48 But the only jobs you’ve identified that you’re talking about are oil patch jobs. You throw jobs and economic prosperity around without being able define outside of the oil patch what that means! If anything, you’ve taken the economic argument out of selling this pipeline to BC.
4914 2018-03-31 19:39:39 Lol I came in here for a FREE oil change that’s covered by my warranty, and this man tried to add on some other services totaling $350. Lol “oil conditioner” and shit. Gtf.

4921 2018-03-31 19:39:10 This is blatant propaganda BS. The financial post is a know minion of the oil industry. I would suggest never reading this crap media outlet.

4931 2018-03-31 19:37:35 @GailSimone So because he's made of plastic, which is made from oil, which is made from dinosaurs, does this mean that Plastic Man is actually a pterodactyl?
4932 2018-03-31 19:37:22 You gotta grow em out and not touch them! My brow lady said to use castor oil to help with growth!
4933 2018-03-31 19:37:13 DO NOT TAKE CASTER OIL!! It makes you poop but also makes your baby poop and it can make them sick or die in the womb 
4934 2018-03-31 19:37:12 Oil change for my baby.
4935 2018-03-31 19:37:12 arsalan absolutely uses that oil to jack off
4936 2018-03-31 19:36:58 #NCR2018 #NCR2018stats #CPT2018 Oil King (Rashid) v Momochi (Kolin) no. 1: Oil King threw Momochi in the right corner 3 times and left corner 1 time in Game 1 @Sajam @reepal
4937 2018-03-31 19:36:56 I guess you need to read up a bit more. The plan is clearly laid out.

My family and our business are leaving before Kenney can cripple the province. 

I'm willing to pay more to help out. I'm not willing to suffer austerity to pander to oil companies.
4938 2018-03-31 19:36:52 Hello mr trump I think you are doing a great job but I have a problem I got caught with a joint in 2001 I ame from Canada but I was in the USA when this took place I am trying to regain entree to the USA but having a hard time what do I need to do, I work hard in the oil field.
4939 2018-03-31 19:36:41 [nipple] I can just put some tea tree oil
4940 2018-03-31 19:36:28 It's either a bad seal or wrong oil. My issue was wrong oils. What kind of vape?
4941 2018-03-31 19:36:20 camphor essential oil for good sleep, let's do this
4942 2018-03-31 19:36:15 So my car needs Control Arms, Tires, Spark plugs, Oil Change, a wheel alignment, and fluids changed. $1,600.00 dollars later but atleast it will be safe to drive 
4943 2018-03-31 19:36:10 You put coconut oil on your face? 
4944 2018-03-31 19:36:08 It's all about money. Money money and some more oil money.
4945 2018-03-31 19:36:05 >She's just searching for a puddle of oil-
4946 2018-03-31 19:36:03 Mer: who needs essential oils when you have food oil?
4947 2018-03-31 19:36:02 Yeah, because every single penny of taxpayer money must be approved by every single citizen. How much money goes to oil companies, to Israel, to Halliburton, ad nauseum.
4948 2018-03-31 19:35:55 I'm not sure I follow. Can oil exporters only take proceeds out of China by converting to gold first?
4949 2018-03-31 19:35:46 Dormant oil should just be oil. You should be able to find a product with an ingredient list.
4950 2018-03-31 19:35:43 This made me laugh (sorry). About 18 years ago I had a house in Evanton nr Dingwall. Bad snow one winter for 2 weeks. Ran out of oil, gas, & logs. Looked in the cellar. Found my beloved father in law's Chaucer collection of books. Always meant to thank him for the bequest...
4951 2018-03-31 19:35:26 Spain is the world's largest producer of olive oil.

Italy is a leading manufacturer of industrial and construction equipment.

Ireland hosts European bases for Microsoft, Dell Ebay and other leading tech companies.

France, naturally is the biggest exporter of wine.
4952 2018-03-31 19:35:23 Switching my normal moisturizer that I use during nighttime with olive oil. Will let yall know if it'll improve my skin 
4953 2018-03-31 19:35:14 Your point exactly sir
4954 2018-03-31 19:35:09 Good read. Thank you for sharing. I am replying solely as someone who's worked in upstream U.S. energy and trades the associated futures and options. A case can be made CNY oil futures will be a force someday, but not with the existing constraints.

4956 2018-03-31 19:34:59 Much as many would want to heap all blames on political leadership for our underperformance, it’s pertinent to remember that the 1st set of leaders weren’t thieves & they laid the foundation of NGR. Railways, airways, ports, universities etc. Mega theft/corruption came with oil

4958 2018-03-31 19:34:55 First of all, nobody uses Bing. Second, HRC isn't going to prison. Third, USA will not be oil independent. Fourth, the dollar has never not been the standard. Korea will not unite and Israel/Palestine is still a shit show. Again, you pack a lot of wrong in each tweet.
4959 2018-03-31 19:34:52 @DaleJr watching a Lucas Oil dirt race on NBCSN
4960 2018-03-31 19:34:45 Since my mama been in town I have been fed, I have my bed, my gas tank is filled, my oil has been changed, my cable and WiFi has been signed up for and will be installed next week, I got new clothes.. and no money in my account has been touched.  An angel and Queen fr.

4962 2018-03-31 19:34:35 Changing my oil with it being this windy was a lil difficult LOL
4963 2018-03-31 19:34:33 Gold Circle condom like 2 years ago was just 30naira and it had 4pieces inside the pack,  but now its 100naira with only 3pieces inside.  Even the oil inside have reduced.  who did we offend in this country???  

Where did i drop my PVC self #2019
4964 2018-03-31 19:34:19 Since I scheduled my oil change you’d think I’d have priority over walk-ins
4965 2018-03-31 19:34:19 Idk .. the % of oil in that lil thing is too much compared to the actual food.. feels weird... but i do eat potatoes but i made them myself in the oven so no oil
4966 2018-03-31 19:34:08 lets go oil king!!! #uyu
4967 2018-03-31 19:33:54 I just reminded @joshrogin that stealing oil and occupying Syria and Iraq isn't OIR's mission.
4968 2018-03-31 19:33:50 @LIBGyal the cleaning oil smells amazing and i love the packaging. Im excited!
4969 2018-03-31 19:33:50 We’ll be using oil for decades, I think. It will be a long sunset with oil-producing jurisdictions duking it out over the spoils.
4970 2018-03-31 19:33:38 @themichellewie Don't know if it is legal on LPGA, but Hemp Seed oil has helped my knee pain tremendously. One knee replaced 2 years ago and other is bone on bone without any pain since starting. Worth trying for arthritis if legal..

4973 2018-03-31 19:33:22 Kinda like America now? Sticking our noses in other countries wars & battles for their oil? Same damn thing! It doesn’t give outsiders that took their first step on to new lands & kill those already there, then claim to be the founders! Plymouth Rock my ass!
4974 2018-03-31 19:32:42 I could see possible persuasion to invest in saudi arabia, helping it to become less dependent on oil.
4975 2018-03-31 19:32:28 Not your oil Josh.   

Why do Americans think they're entitled to the world's resources?
4976 2018-03-31 19:32:25 No observable oil leaks!

4984 2018-03-31 19:31:12 I think I’ve entered hell I came to get an oil change, they told me it’d be over an hour and they WONT TAKE MY PHONE NUMBER SO I CAN LEAVE
4985 2018-03-31 19:31:12 French are tough and aggressive militarily,
 and were a quasi swing member in the Russo Iranian Alliance until the poisonings. 

*France Oil Company Total has  major oil deals pending with Iran, so expect French to become bigger player on The Region.
4986 2018-03-31 19:31:02 i put this nasty tea tree oil on my flesh bc its supposed to be good for removing blemishes n junk but it smells so awful so i put lotion under my nose and i currently have a cafe mocha scented candle lit right in front of my face
4987 2018-03-31 19:31:00 You might hand it to them again . Couple of bags of oil money in it for you again to have a few “ small bets “

4990 2018-03-31 19:30:22 No dauphinoise? The world's greatest kind of potato.

Also hasslebacks are standard in our house: brush all over with vegetable oil, sprinkle with salt flakes and black pepper, roast. I find they work best with small waxy potatoes like you'd use for salad.
4991 2018-03-31 19:30:14 This is even worth than what the big oil companies are doing to our environment. There is no justification whatsoever to do this as agents of Government. Can't they at least pack it to somewhere and use a safe method to disposed it?
4992 2018-03-31 19:30:11 What it is, I think, is that oil became Alberta’s claim to fame and the province can’t seem to face changing its self-image. Think Sunset Boulevard: “I’m ready for my close-up.”
4993 2018-03-31 19:30:00 I love your paint palette. That is how my pallets look with oil and acrylic. There are very beautiful contrasts here Mr.Bucci.
4994 2018-03-31 19:30:00 We have on, an episode of ' Midsomer murders' , in which the victim is covered in truffle oil and eaten by wild boar. Second only to the one in which a bloke is staked out in garden and killed by wine from his own cellar being trebuchet'd at him.
4995 2018-03-31 19:29:37 France, Italy and Spain won't want Britain to stop buying wine, olive oil, cheese, and all the processed food US companies have moved production of to EU countries.

It would mean that US companies would have to open production plants in the UK in order to profit from our market.
4996 2018-03-31 19:29:33 Me: Just change my oil and rotate my tires .

4998 2018-03-31 19:29:17 It's time to do to oil what we did to salt....use technology to reduce its value to that of a undesired commodity.

5001 2018-03-31 19:28:21 do you use white truffle oil and Himalayan sea salt?

5006 2018-03-31 19:27:33 You know, I thought that too when I was there in January. And in my old DZ hood no more grotty restaurants pouring oil in the gutters and chuar sticks attracting 1 million flies.
5007 2018-03-31 19:27:14 They're the biggest oil importer in the world
5008 2018-03-31 19:27:13 isn’t the oil in the cny contract a different type of oil? why would it influence brent if it isn’t ?
5009 2018-03-31 19:27:07 Today I learned an important lesson. @Valvoline is over priced and not worth the time savings for an oil change.
5010 2018-03-31 19:27:05 I relate to the scene in The Chi when Emmett looks in disgust because the guy who owns the chicken joint reuses and filters the cooking oil but like thats where the flavour comes from bro
5011 2018-03-31 19:27:00 Cetaphil is drying and doesn’t actually clean shit, St. Ives causes micro tears and coconut oil is highly comodogenic and also basically is terrible at moisturising the skin

5018 2018-03-31 19:26:16 Tea tree oil. It worked for several people i know
5019 2018-03-31 19:25:38 Well does it have  be only one? I am torn between in no order: @mikexingchen I love food  travels different places eat not to mention I love hot oil too, @RomanAtwood cuz all the fun wild crazy big boy stuff he does, and @Lyricoldrap he seems like a really nice down to earth guy
5020 2018-03-31 19:25:29 I’m really sad to see d way this is been carried out.They should be trained to meet d tasks ahead. D implications of pouring oil like that straight into to d environment are enormous. A place shud have been designated to do this kind of things to limit d damages to d environment
5021 2018-03-31 19:25:28 Iranian people with the 4th biggest oil and 1th natural gas are hustling for food and water,having the weakest money between 200 countries around the world and what  does iranian government do?

5025 2018-03-31 19:24:45 You can brush them with baking soda, and/or buff out the top layer of nail. Daily application of cuticle oil keeps them healthy too. The yellow will eventually fade even if you do nothing. Applying a base coat in the future before you polish can prevent it in the future 
5026 2018-03-31 19:24:12 I’m getting drunk already. My oil change was probably done like an hour and a half ago
5027 2018-03-31 19:24:06 Forgot to say, even better if you rub it with a wee bit of good olive oil and salt as well.
5028 2018-03-31 19:23:58 But they don't incessantly preach cleanness & sell snake oil to corporates that marginal gains can help their business. Sky & brailsford are graduating deserve to be highlighted.

5039 2018-03-31 19:23:00 I remember reading on the wiki whether or not this is true but the tankers were painted black on one side and white on the other. for milk and tar, or was it the oil instead of the tar? idk thought it was interesting.

Also u will get ur clothes dirty :))
5049 2018-03-31 19:21:44 550 barrels is all the oil company is claiming....activists think it is upwards of 25,000 barrels

5059 2018-03-31 19:20:42 IMO the CNY oil contract = possible critical wound to Bass' & Hendry's bearish CNY case.  Hard to have a Balance of Payments crisis when you can print domestic currency for imports, no?
5060 2018-03-31 19:20:23 Also, the Russians already have Iran as an ally, which has the 4th largest known oil reserves.

5069 2018-03-31 19:19:11 This is from Dr Mercola we have been using it for a few years with 0 ticks even in Rondeau Park

5076 2018-03-31 19:18:13 Skin is a bitch. I also take fish oil and biotin which helps your hair and your skin and your heart quite a bit. Also wash your pillow cases often
5077 2018-03-31 19:18:10 Yeah it’s one of NJ or FLA.
5078 2018-03-31 19:18:07 I’m sure the carbon footprint of moving oil from Prudoe Bay, one of the most environmentally sensitive areas on the planet, to Vancouver; makes way more sense to those in BC than buying AB or Sask Oil.  Brainwashed.
5079 2018-03-31 19:17:55 cant wait until their oil runs out and they can’t control their population when ISIS, Al Qaeda, Muslim Brotherhood comes in

5081 2018-03-31 19:17:48 Albab and afrin and idlib are waste lands for turkey,not useful at all,i fear for east of the river more,mainly oil areas north east
5082 2018-03-31 19:17:45 They are not even allowed the internet in Cuba.  Let’s compare Norway’s nationalizing oil to Venezuela doing the same thing.  Had one worked out?  Or are you saying Norway is going through genocide right now?
5083 2018-03-31 19:17:45 I’m sure the 50% pay cut nips that idea right in the bud. Much like oil and gas, big tech throws money at you to make the feelings go away.
5084 2018-03-31 19:17:34 They carry a bucket of rocks.
5085 2018-03-31 19:17:30 A very one sided argument. You are happy to mention subsidies to renewables. Count the wars fought over access to oil and shipping lanes, the free dumping into the atmosphere subsidy to fossil fuels and the healthcare costs paid by someone other than the polluters.
5086 2018-03-31 19:17:27 $110 for an oil change is that even legal !!? WTF

5091 2018-03-31 19:16:35 no, democrats love their county, are horrified by this president wants to do to it; raping public lands for buddies to drill for oil or minerals,destroying climate. love for country is one reason i hate 45. there are many more concerning his performance, lies, misogyny,inept, etc
5092 2018-03-31 19:16:29 My wife pulled out a USB essential oil diffuser and I did a double-take cause I thought it was a crack pipe.

5104 2018-03-31 19:13:43 EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS FACE MASK: mix milk and coffee grinds together to make a paste then any oil of your choice (if you have dry skin). Then leave it on for 15 mins. Your skin will thank you
5105 2018-03-31 19:13:36 Do I really NEED this car maintenance or are they just recommending it for extra money !?  all I asked for was an oil change 
5106 2018-03-31 19:13:03 I bought the Trader Joe’s harissa. I wonder if I’ll regret it like I did their sesame oil and yuzu kosho. Also their umami tube isn’t that good either. Why do I keep giving them a chance?

Scotland was told we would be out the EU if we voted yes
Pensioners were lied to saying their pensions would be lost

I repeat - your “union” is dead
5117 2018-03-31 19:11:32 i fucking love my dad, needed an oil change & i said i didn’t have time to do it before i left & he just picked up my car from my job & did it :’)
5118 2018-03-31 19:11:17 That’s not regular coconut oil. Something completely different. $5.99 for an essential oil isn’t crazy expensive.

5129 2018-03-31 19:10:00 alright I don't wanna see people putting on any PicsArt filter on a picture and be like "I drew/painted this." Like no, that's the sketch filter/oil painting filter.

5131 2018-03-31 19:09:48 Like u had oil under IT
5132 2018-03-31 19:09:42 Okay, interest peaked! How are these companies monopolies; especially compared to something like Standard Oil?
5133 2018-03-31 19:09:41 I like to slice them thin marinate them for like 30 minutes in white balsamic, a little salt, and good olive oil and then just eat them like that (or put on pesto pizza like that)!
5134 2018-03-31 19:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

5139 2018-03-31 19:09:09 Rosehip oil is really the truth. I got one from Trilogy in my latest gratis bag, and it’s doing wonders for my skin.

5146 2018-03-31 19:07:59 I just watched the movie Network. So... the "Mad as Hell" quote on the @OVOEnergy advert is from an alcoholic, islamophobic, gullible  corporate shill railling against artificially inflated oil prices in a movie about how political movements and commerce corrupt each other. #SMH
5147 2018-03-31 19:07:50 Lavender oil. Put drops all around the area. Ants hate lavender
5148 2018-03-31 19:07:21 Looks like it might use a little oil too.  #LivePD

5158 2018-03-31 19:04:59 I feel like you could just use the loreal lumi drops with some lotion or oil to do the same thing..
5159 2018-03-31 19:04:43 The fact remains that AB has long had a boom and bust economy. The industry itself caused the supply glut that presents problems for AB (again) and, unfortunately, the world is awash in better oil than bitumen.

5164 2018-03-31 19:04:08 Sort of! You could run a T140 having fitted decent carbs, belt primary, modern wiring and electronic ignition providing you then get it properly looked at every year over winter. Just follow the rules about warming up and oil changes.
5165 2018-03-31 19:04:05 oh yeah & you don’t really need all those products, some ppl are different tho. I stopped using products but when I did use them, I used Shea moisture and Argan oil products it really helps your hair to be stronger and curlier

5179 2018-03-31 19:02:28 its oil not dabs
5180 2018-03-31 19:02:27 Because there's still enough oil to do for a few decades. But trade off isn't worth it-- economically, socially, & environment-wise. Not sure why Alberta is so afraid of the future??

5205 2018-03-31 18:59:29 It's usually easy for the test, but I've only put 3192kms on the car in 7 years.. so the computer wanted 10% in a week to turn on the sensors and let it pass. It has not oil leaks, water leaks, nothing..Exhaust it clear and cool.. but even though the car is showroom, it must pass

5213 2018-03-31 18:57:41 Iran has enough oil. This one is Syrian, not American to give or take.

5216 2018-03-31 18:57:33 Argan Oil !!! 
Massage it onto your eyelids up to your lashes every night before sleeping 
It helped with mine!

5218 2018-03-31 18:57:17 Hi Sarah,  thanks for the selfie gallery,  you look sensational in your sexy bodysuit covered in baby oil,   loved it.   
5219 2018-03-31 18:57:11 honda’s engines are more reliable and last longer than the other ones. my dad had one for almost 15 years with barely ANY repairs other than oil changes and tires
5220 2018-03-31 18:57:05 You get a mere happy event moisterizer, bio oil and a nivea anti perspirent at Clicks and you have to pay R500000000000 
5221 2018-03-31 18:56:34 For 30 days give up the honey and fruit. Berries and cherries are ok in moderation. Better to get fully fat adapted and then play with it. Agree on the HWC in the coffee. Or coconut oil.
5222 2018-03-31 18:56:31 I'm wearing a necklace that an essential oil diffuser with Blue Tansy EO on it. It helps with allergies.
5223 2018-03-31 18:56:16 Any chance you are using flax oil? Trendy for seasoning but flax is naturally mucilaginous (why used as egg replacement in vegan baking) and its oil has residual stickiness after being refined. Best to season a wok: buy a bunch of chives/scallions, add veg oil, cook until black.
5224 2018-03-31 18:56:07 It’s Barry M lip oil! Used it on top of a nude lipstick from NYX
5225 2018-03-31 18:55:59 The oil companies did. Thanks, David and Charles Koch and your heirs

5231 2018-03-31 18:55:27 Love it, looks great and that extra note about oil is awesome! I always want to do this but just never keep track!
5232 2018-03-31 18:55:21 Yeah. However what if they made trophy hunters use nothing but their bodies lathered in oil and a 3 inch pocket knife? Now that's some hunting.
5233 2018-03-31 18:55:04 It finally succumbed to the hammer (and penetrating oil), but not before leaving a considerable amount of the hammer in pieces on the garage floor!
5234 2018-03-31 18:54:54 Isn’t it funny that the “2”teams that do it have a Russian sugar daddy and oil rich Arabs
5235 2018-03-31 18:54:50 And I don’t wear lotion only baby oil gel
5236 2018-03-31 18:54:19 The way some of u lot make plantain pisses me off. It’s not stir fry or pancake for you to place a swab of oil. Deep fry it.
5237 2018-03-31 18:54:04 @uncletypewriter see someone who fries Dodo without oil.. The lies on this app ehn
5238 2018-03-31 18:53:58 #Passover2018 because there’s no better time to tell my cousin that my mom will no longer participate in her essential oil pyramid scheme
5239 2018-03-31 18:53:32 Iran oil.Not Syria.Syria is the gatekeepers for all the oil reserves to flow from the east to the west except for the oil coming from Saudi Arabia/Quatar(our allies).Al Assad (Syria),Russia and Iran will not let us passage through Syria for us to sell our oil in Europe.
5240 2018-03-31 18:53:29 Much of the Blue Jays fanbase blame Shapiro/Atkins for this and they would be wrong. Those guys have shown they can build a good young core but there is no question ownership wants fans in seats. Not a good mix.
5241 2018-03-31 18:53:24 Also it ain’t as simple as Middle Eastern oil versus Americans lmao
5242 2018-03-31 18:53:19 Nasty but helps....I hate Castor oil. Can't remember the last time I drank it. Probably in my teen years
5243 2018-03-31 18:53:03 Massive hypocrisy and you continue to ignore the 500 plus oil Yankees from Alaska.

5256 2018-03-31 18:51:03 Hey girl. I’m a nail tech too. It’s a fungus, from moisture trapped under the nail. Tea tree oil + a cuticle oil is a good way to get rid of it. But it usually takes at least a week. and you have to be diligent about applying the oil. 2-4x a day.
5257 2018-03-31 18:51:00 Yeah but that marketplace has shown time and time again the casual fan won't come out unless they are in the mix. With the AL being this bad, they'll contend for that 2nd WC but can't see them getting it,
5258 2018-03-31 18:50:38 o turtlecat so cute..i bet you love fresh tuna with a sprinkling of beautiful portuguese olive oil..maybe a little fresh ham from wiltshire youd like that..and a toy..maybe howabout a squeaky mouse..you dont have to do much kitty..come on kitty..come to me
5259 2018-03-31 18:50:38 The Green Party wants no nuclear - c20% of our energy supply, no coal - c10%, no gas c40% and no oil. In times of little daylight and little wind, how will they keep the country running and the people warm (alive.)  Solar panels - used by the rich - paid for by the poor.
5260 2018-03-31 18:50:32 Every single time... sometimes I’m just going in for oil and a filter and they always want to make sure I’m getting the right one for my car...like I do this every 3,000 miles...I know what I need.
5261 2018-03-31 18:50:23 If Republicans continue talking about losing House, Republicans  will probably lose. What's done is done. Talk about how the average American has benefited from tax cuts, record employment, derugulations, oil production, manufacturing etc.
Why the negativity?
5262 2018-03-31 18:50:17 Finishing. Trying an oil finish applied to the hot steel
5263 2018-03-31 18:50:12 Syria is a sovereign country. Iran has enough gas to trade for oil. This is just propaganda.
5264 2018-03-31 18:50:12 ICYMI GOP owned Oklahoma & production tax whilst oil was $100/barrel, the payoffs:

4 day school weeks
Blew ‘Rainy Day Fund’
Lowest paid teachers in US
Proposed Selling State Assets
Raised Consumer Taxes

Trickle Down is a LIE!
#GOPTaxBillScam is a SCAM!

5267 2018-03-31 18:49:45 I love when my friends hmu to run random errands. Yes bitch you gotta get an oil change? I’m down! Your mom wants you to pick up that thing from that place? Vroom vroom nigga let’s gooo

5270 2018-03-31 18:49:25 The olive oil eco styler gel does not disappoint when it comes to hold.
5271 2018-03-31 18:49:25 LOL!  You steal land, water, gas, oil, and make claims that you grew the oranges too! There is no end on how special you are!
5272 2018-03-31 18:49:11 Actually Saudi Arabia started to have multiple income source beside the oil.
5273 2018-03-31 18:49:11 So, if I say:
Fracking is bad, because it contaminates groundwater.
Are you going to say:
You didn't mention how oil drives our Capitalistic economy, therefore your argument is too simple and childish.

5275 2018-03-31 18:48:43 So I went in Auto Zone minding my business and this old man was like he thought Beyoncé walked in the store but he ain't see Jay-Z. Then he said if he had gotten paid this week he would have paid for the oil I was buying 
5276 2018-03-31 18:48:34 I concur. Tea tree oil Did the trick for me
5277 2018-03-31 18:48:25 couldn't bring myself to read it. snake oil by any other name, and it will never go away as long as there are ignorant people who can be taken advantage of.
5278 2018-03-31 18:48:17 You are a friend of United israel and big oil seller ,but nothing else in the wonderful world.
5279 2018-03-31 18:48:01 That's smart. I've done applesauce for the same effect, basically can't taste it and it's a great replacement if the cake calls for a cup or more of oil (split it half and half)

5286 2018-03-31 18:46:29 Also, @Michael_Angelos if you are trying to project a more Italian image like with your green boxes then why are you not being authentic in ingredients? Real Italian food uses olive oil, not soybean oil.
5287 2018-03-31 18:46:26 Yeah I’ve heard that too! But my mom’s always made chocolate cake with this in place of oil, it works surprisingly well to make it moist!

5294 2018-03-31 18:45:17 So just egg and oil?
5295 2018-03-31 18:45:08 Every time Republicans control government the price of gas and diesel skyrocket. The American people pay more at the pump, oil companies and car manufacturers increase their profits, and our air quality deteriorates.  How are the American people benefiting again?
5296 2018-03-31 18:45:07 That recipe I screwed up was no knead. I messed by having to work it a bit as it was too sticky. I didn't let it rest afterward and threw it into the oven instead. It was a bit dense but not horrible and reminded me of bread from Carrabbas dunked in their oil mixture.
5297 2018-03-31 18:45:03 Went in for a simple oil change and now I need (another) new tire. #Easter2018
5298 2018-03-31 18:44:51 When life gives you plastic lemons, make oil.

5302 2018-03-31 18:44:08 lawnmower won’t start??

well,

well take the engine cover off (you’ll need wrench and knife)
add gas til it overfloweth
add a lil’ oil
hit the engine parts with a bat (to check fuel)
turn that mower upside down 
turn that frown upside down- your mower is truly fixed
5303 2018-03-31 18:44:06 I did not give my prosperity generously. Worked our butts off for 40 years, squirrelled our cash for retirement-no pension, +paid LOTS of tax to .  All the while listening to other Canadians bad mouth us for working in oil+gas. Will whine if I feel like it. Earned that right
5304 2018-03-31 18:44:05 And in Syria there isn't that much oil to take to begin with. It's a red herring, destroying the secular state of Syria is done solely to benefit Israel and Gulf Wahabbis.

5314 2018-03-31 18:42:32 Because its syrian ground and syria doesnt talk to us or care about it. To put it simply its a lebanese lie, much like saying with all seriousness that israel is buying oil from martian aliens
5315 2018-03-31 18:42:32 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5317 2018-03-31 18:42:14 There are remedies for predatory pricing. Amazon is not exactly Standard Oil in terms of anticompetitive behavior - more of a market maker.
5318 2018-03-31 18:42:12 What?! The Russians passed the Sherman Antitrust Act and are responsible for dismantling Standard Oil and American Tobacco Co.?! This madness has to stop!
5319 2018-03-31 18:42:06 You are charging fuel surcharges based on oil prices . Why don’t you run your plants on oil if there is a shortage of gas?

5327 2018-03-31 18:40:24 Olive oil not oil oil. My apologies.
5328 2018-03-31 18:40:22 JPM, GS, they're all wrong, all the time. If you notice I tweet opinions on both sides. I'm not losing a moment of sleep with oil prices. #NTOG has solid assets that perform well at lower oil prices. #Oil #WTI #Brent #OOTT
5329 2018-03-31 18:40:18 No NEBC jobs of supplying oil via pipeline will be lost if we do not extend the line to Westridge, increase production and increase the number of oil tankers passing through the Burrard Inlet and Metro Vancouver to Asia. #bcpoli #cdnpoli

5331 2018-03-31 18:40:07 I guarantee most of these people would be outraged if Russia invaded the US and started forcing U.S. citizens out of their homes. But since Israel gives the US oil, it's all okay and justified

5336 2018-03-31 18:39:27 I have the sweetest sister in the world! She knows how stressed I am, so she packs me my lunch everyday, gives me her car for work and now she put oil in my hair and braided it cause I haven’t been taken care of it  Alhumdulillah!
5337 2018-03-31 18:39:21 ?
5338 2018-03-31 18:39:09 Just to clarify...(cuz that tweet was a bit ambiguous) I meant that Trump's admin *has* been opening our public lands to oil and fracking. Trump and his fellow nature-rapists have to go.
5339 2018-03-31 18:38:58 So we’re pulling out of Syria, which helps Putin take control of the Exxon Mobile/ Russian oil pipeline and Trump’s telling his cabinet not to report or talk about anything disparaging of Russia, but There is no collusion and Putin doesn’t have that pesky piss tape? Traitor?
5340 2018-03-31 18:38:55 "Boys in the same club" no oil could be transported thru US territory in Syria proper that wasn't destined to Israel via Turkey. Which this case was, still no proof Turkey supports IS as a policy apart from being an easy scapegoat.

5342 2018-03-31 18:38:42 Instead of USAID maybe let Caribbean/ S.A. producers import at a profit to boost econs and let the market decide?
5343 2018-03-31 18:38:34 Who wants an oil spill? Certainly not pipeline companies, nor tanker owners nor oil owners due to massive liability costs.
5344 2018-03-31 18:38:23 i put too much olive oil in my salad but... yolo
5345 2018-03-31 18:38:23 Cooking oil theyo fulhi eh #MaldivianIdol 
5346 2018-03-31 18:37:58 Decode what ? It’s too dumb to even discuss. Iran produces nearly 4 million barrels a day. What is a tiny stupid 100-150k barrels going to do? Syria’s oil is hardly enough for Syria’s own needs. The oil is landlocked. No port access. It’s all just beyond dumb
5347 2018-03-31 18:37:56 Ines bangun aq lakukan dengan badanku pakai oil dampai lantai juga basah penuh oil. Mau...

5349 2018-03-31 18:37:52 I fucked it up but it still came out good enough to eat. I made a great meal with roasted peppers, tomato, mozz, some italian spices sprinkled onto it and made the bread into garlic toast and served the vegetables on top of it drizzled with oil oil and balsamic. I was very happy.

5351 2018-03-31 18:37:51 What a great price to buy in at.
5352 2018-03-31 18:37:10 You're right, in a literal sense. Then again, so is the GBP (we have neither gold nor oil) and definitely the Euro.

The perils of a debt-driven economy.
5353 2018-03-31 18:37:10 Oil spill narrative highly sensational & wrong. 

WA state has many refineries on coast & more oil traffic today actually. 

A spill with double hulled, NAV system & pilot equipped tanker at slow speed won’t happen. It’s just irrational hype sensationalized by rating starved TV!
5354 2018-03-31 18:37:07 We’re talking about Syria. According to Wiki, Trinidad and Tobago produce twice as much oil as Syria. There are 58 countries that produce more than Syria and most of Syria’s oil goes to the EU. The question remains, what US national interest do we have in Syria?
5355 2018-03-31 18:37:04 with Tea Tree Oil you only need to use a small amount.  On a cotton ball (or kleenex or tissue) it repels - ants, moths, mosquitos, fleas, spiders. The aroma is a very strong mint. You can use mint, but TTO smells a strong strong mint.
5356 2018-03-31 18:36:59 My niece put her wand in cooking oil.. -.-   time for work.

5375 2018-03-31 18:34:12 The dollar is a fiat currency and it isn’t backed by oil it isn’t backed by anything at all.
5376 2018-03-31 18:34:05 The Miguna ordeal is just a gimmick...the Turkana oil is the main deal where eyes have been trained on. A dictatorship will deliver what democracy will never. Don't be blinded.

5382 2018-03-31 18:33:33 Does anyone use Acure, Pacifica, or SW Basics products? I’ve been using nothing but charcoal soap, sugar scrub? and Argan oil on my face for a couple of years now and because sugar can be abrasive and it’s dry here, I’d like to try something different (natural).
5383 2018-03-31 18:33:31 i scheduled my last oil change through him! lol
5384 2018-03-31 18:33:27 I think that Health Canada puts a cap of 25% THC in the strongest oil. I know both Tilray and CannTrust have THC drops of no more than 25%

5390 2018-03-31 18:32:49 @MoHCCZim @DrDParirenyatwa you continuously moan about not getting a large enough budget allocation but you fail to propose how you can get a larger portion, say a special tax of no more than $0.05 on items like cigarettes, sugar + aligned products, alcohol, milk, cooking oil

5398 2018-03-31 18:31:50 errrrr look at the division and then tell me it's not a case of a level playing field you mong.  Man City can outspend Man Utd, Chelsea , Arsenal and Liverpool 10 times over due to one thing. Oil. Spurs have a limited budget due to the new ground.
5399 2018-03-31 18:31:43 Trying to make a "garlic and herb" olive oil infusion. Hopefully this counts as pulling myself back together.
5400 2018-03-31 18:31:28 Cant talk about Morality when Chelsea is and still founded by oil money through their owner and United owners generate some of their money through animal killing. Yes UAE isn't moral but so aren't most of the teams in the league. Just appreciate City playing this amazing style.
5401 2018-03-31 18:31:07 Thought for the day... if you go to get your oil changed and the waiting room is nicer than your living room you are paying too much...
5402 2018-03-31 18:31:01 I have made myself the best buffet - various cheeses, dips, olives, tomatoes, ham, warm ciabatta, sexy olive oil, flirty balsamic - and have a bucket of gin.

I KNOW.
5403 2018-03-31 18:30:48 This is blatant propaganda. Don't legitimate it by apologizing for this garbage content that a bunch of billionaire, idiot oil magnates are paying this kid to post.

5407 2018-03-31 18:30:17 Is it socially acceptable to get an oil change in a onesie

5426 2018-03-31 18:27:15 The kings of Israel were anointed with oil. Oil is not easily washed off symbolizing the Spirit.

5436 2018-03-31 18:26:11 they are cutting off their nose to spite their face. Move Donaldson this winter for a postion player or two and then have a presser and explain youre rebuilding. Tell the fans to still come out bcos you still need the rev for the next time you compete
5437 2018-03-31 18:26:10 They'll just jack up the already high price of oil to cover it.  No problem.

5460 2018-03-31 18:22:23 I suppose the Russia/China plans could be construed as a direct attack on the US. However, if the US hadn't preferred oil as backing for their currency; and if they hadn't gone out of their way to interfere in so many other countries, things might be different now.

5472 2018-03-31 18:21:14 Yesterday china started using their yaun for trading oil . 10 billion in the first HOUR.   Many countries are trying to dump the US dollar . I do believe now is a good time to buy silver .  The dollar has touched down in the 70's ..(cents ) . Inflation will eat us alive. PREPARE

5476 2018-03-31 18:20:46 Omg I bought coconut butter/manna for the first time and I didn’t realize that there was a layer of coconut oil at the top and I legit ate a scoop of it 
5477 2018-03-31 18:20:45 Don't leave the oil in for too long, just enough to keep it moisturized
5478 2018-03-31 18:20:25 Amazing work. Shame to see so many affected oil coated and distressed birds from this unnecessary incident. One in a regular series of what should be avoidable environmental disasters.

5480 2018-03-31 18:19:49 @PhilipTeresi I'm making my stand now. I will never have a chocolate bar or use baby oil again.
5481 2018-03-31 18:19:47 She awoke at 1:13 that afternoon. Reaching, she then sparks a lighter on its last legs, hits from an unfinished bowl from night prior. Has a strong welling feeling of excitement at the thought of rocks. Saturday and raining, but then remembers oil is a thing that needs changing
5482 2018-03-31 18:19:40 What’s a good oil free foundation that has full coverage
5483 2018-03-31 18:19:40 Would it work to remind him that there isn't much abt coal, oil, or gas in the Bible, but plenty abt the Sun? In fact, it was specifically created and called "good," so there's that.
5484 2018-03-31 18:19:38 You know how there's been huge money in Oil. There still is. 

It the same with Global Warming/ Climate change. It's big bucks. 

We can influence our Climate, but not change it. 
Homo sapiens are too small for that.
5485 2018-03-31 18:19:34 Mention Gold, Oil, China and all logic leaves the human brain 
5486 2018-03-31 18:19:29 Coffee, unwich, pick up overwatch finally, good will to drop off clothes, and oil change. More productive than my usual Saturday mornings!
5487 2018-03-31 18:19:27 That's a good idea! The wrappers are generally vegan, some brands may have eggs. Air fryer is some contraption you put in your oven that supposedly cooks things as crispy as a deep fryer would, but without any oil.
5488 2018-03-31 18:19:17 Trump's "base" is getting played again. Just lining up for more snake oil, credit cards in hand.

5490 2018-03-31 18:18:59 Pipelines to ISIS traveled thru Turkey. Some Turks got rich off of ISIS oil; but no: ISIS was a Saudi Salafi thing, organized, equipped, and paid for by the Saudis. Turks were different groups: Pan-Turkics, and some Al Qaida. The ones the US claimed were "moderates."
5491 2018-03-31 18:18:44 bud to oil should be like a 12 oz natty vs a 12 oz 80 proof vodka
5492 2018-03-31 18:18:22 I even ordered cinnamon oil
5493 2018-03-31 18:18:10 The reed with oil or else stakes of the broth of more dryness, the breast of the white pap, at each animal itself, poured
5494 2018-03-31 18:17:55 Cetaphil daily wash, pat your face with tea tree oil(it’ll burn but that’s a good thing), and then whatever moisturizer you like afterwards
5495 2018-03-31 18:17:50 I agree but it's been disappointing seeing the share price drop from 10p to 1p (losing 90% of its value) in as many months.
5496 2018-03-31 18:17:46 Interesting anyway. Previously unknown, provides insight into spread of pathogens, infection and disease generally. Blocking mechanisms?

5500 2018-03-31 18:17:27 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
5501 2018-03-31 18:17:16 “Only leaving this coconut oil in for 20 min”

2 hrs later
5502 2018-03-31 18:16:57 You need to !!!! Even just eating it alone with just some salt lemon juice and olive oil!! It’s super duper delicious
5503 2018-03-31 18:16:53 Big soccer day for me. Watched Bayern now the red bulls at 3 I will watch galaxy and after that game head downtown to watch Indy 11 at their new field in Lucas oil
5504 2018-03-31 18:16:53 Red herring. I didn’t create the oil sands but I helped get it out of the ground so that they could be used to create many of the necessities of our modern lifestyle. As a bonus I got paid well and various govts got to tax me to fund things like healthcare, education, etc
5505 2018-03-31 18:16:50 all the activists from GREEN PEACE goes to the BIG BAT COMPANIES ... and turn the page .... just like that !!! Boats use HEAVY OIL ... which is ... worse that fake-facts!

5507 2018-03-31 18:16:38 @realDonaldTrump the opportunity exists to let Putin destroy his economy w/adventurism & in the Middle East etc w/moronic expensive colonialism he can’t afford or support! Ending Iran agreement puts Russia at odds in oil biz & building LNG to supply EU! #MAGA opportunity!

5509 2018-03-31 18:16:24 CBD Oil?
5510 2018-03-31 18:16:14 it was delicious. sweet potato bites, olive oil, rosemary, and cinnamon 
5511 2018-03-31 18:16:08 That oil had me slumped  lemme get up running behind on my schedule
5512 2018-03-31 18:15:57 Boil a pan of water with an essential oil in like lemon or rosemary. Turn on the extractor fan so the smell permeates through. If you used the oven put the oil & water in a dish in the oven. It might help.
5513 2018-03-31 18:15:24 Use some coconut oil bro
5514 2018-03-31 18:15:21 I came to work and i asked one of the guys if he can check my car because it was doing some weird thing and next thing you know he hooked it up with a free oil change

5520 2018-03-31 18:14:20 There are statements by Assange where he talks about this.

I'm stuck between 'believe women' and 'don't automatically trust (the oil/gas must flow) government'.

I'll I'm thinking through this is that Frank Herbert got it spot on.

My only chance.
5524 2018-03-31 18:13:49 Tar and grease? How about poison and oil. Oils don't soak in or rinse off reptiles well and will actually cause scales to fall off and can literally rot them alive
5525 2018-03-31 18:13:46 Maybe we need a deodorant oil? (Like with peppermint or something).
5526 2018-03-31 18:13:32 Lmaaao you have to talk to them or say oil change

5530 2018-03-31 18:13:05 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
5531 2018-03-31 18:13:00 So I ordered my pad Thai to be Thai hot but they put some oil chili Thai stuff in a container so I thought maybe they didn’t put it in the pad Thai and so I added it and now it’s extra double Thai hot and I’m dying.
5532 2018-03-31 18:12:03 Why did the oil monarch do after a socialist revolution hit Switzerland?

5545 2018-03-31 18:10:03 Leaving that oil alone today. I need to think with a clear mind.
5546 2018-03-31 18:09:58 Y’all my mama got my brakes changed, got me two new tires and my oil changed that’s love ... 
5547 2018-03-31 18:09:50 If the "Kurds" were not sitting on vast oil supplies no one would care....including barry.
5548 2018-03-31 18:09:48 As if you're original statement wasn't a massive generalization. Also assuming a lot about what the oil executives do with more money. We just assumed different things. Although I think it's pretty safe to assume "more rich people shit" over "make people pay less for oil."
5549 2018-03-31 18:09:42 They will kill more Americans than all threats combined. How? Lack of healthcare, clean air & water, polluted lands,oil spills & no gun laws
5550 2018-03-31 18:09:36 Pick strawberries to make cinnamon oil.
5551 2018-03-31 18:09:32 *ADVICE PLEASE*
I’ve just bought an essential oil diffuser but I have pet mice. Does anyone know if certain oils are harmful for them? 

I’m going to probably keep it upstairs anyway (away from the cage) but don’t want to cause my little babies harm or distress.
5552 2018-03-31 18:09:23 when u go to get an oil change and end up spending $700 for brand new brakes :)
5553 2018-03-31 18:09:08 It's called doing the right thing. Who gave Trump or anyone else the moral authority to occupy another nation and steal its oil??

As a born and raised Albertan it took years to chisel away that federal gov't was only ever taking.

5567 2018-03-31 18:07:38 That’s like saying banks, oil companies, and cable companies (among most companies operating in America) are lobbyists so we should not trust them either #doublestandards

5590 2018-03-31 18:04:17 you are never happy, you are a Qatar network spreading islamist and Muslim Brotherhood propaganda, siding with the islamic terrorist theocracy of Iran so your enemy is necessarily Saudi Arabia and you spend your oil money into the media to slander Saudi Arabia, everybody knows it

5593 2018-03-31 18:03:49 Thanks for your insight. During the murderous dark days of Abacha dictatorship in Nigeria, the same Democrats came up with what they called "constructive engagement" - an euphemism for continued oil supply from Nigeria regardless of the misery inflicted on the people. 1/
5594 2018-03-31 18:03:43 Yeah, they were super thick woods and I was in shorts and flip flops as well. It wasn’t just like a “oh you have soft skin” he WOULDNT stop talking about it. I tried to brush it off like “yeah it’s lotion and oil” but he wouldn’t stop talking about it. He chased me when I ran too

Step 1. Lie to the public/fear monger:

3. Invade nation in question.
4. Ruin countless lives.
5. Send PMCs to take oil fields.
6. Profit.
7. Wash, rinse, repeat.

5621 2018-03-31 18:00:30 Iran don’t need the Syrian oil. Syria produced before war 300.000 oil barrel, and Iran oil production daily is 4.4 millions barrel. And have more oil reserve than Syria . Mr columnist
5622 2018-03-31 18:00:27 See thats how its done. Happy munching Delia. xx
5623 2018-03-31 18:00:14 @Jack_Septic_Eye is it real that if you say 'whale oil beef hooked' really fast it sounds like 'well i'll be fucked' in an Irish ascend?  (my sister found it on pintrest and I thought it was a good idea to ask a professional)
5624 2018-03-31 18:00:10 Change oil na aba, tulong?
5625 2018-03-31 18:00:03 Tried to be raunchy and not wear a bra today but then got oil on my shirt so now that’s the center of attention.  Annoying.
5626 2018-03-31 17:59:54 The thing about Kelly is that there is no veil LOL
5627 2018-03-31 17:59:45 What so bad about it? warmer climates means more food can be grown less oil to heat homes
5628 2018-03-31 17:59:42 Depending on how dark the spot is you can leave it alone, with no extensions or polish (just let the nail breathe) and it will go away and you can do the tea tree oil soaks ask well. But the important part is letting it breathe
5629 2018-03-31 17:59:34 Chinese entities eyeing $43 billion Alaska LNG ,,This is pure sizzle rather than substance.  PIPE DREAM.. is DOA.. does not pencil out..

5632 2018-03-31 17:59:03 Hope you feel better each day Sheri. My sister was given only months to live, years back. We prayed for her and the Dr admitted it was not them, but God Who did it! Heartfelt love for you. One thing she also thought helped her was codliver oil.
5633 2018-03-31 17:59:03 use oil
5634 2018-03-31 17:59:02 Button had similar remarks in an interview with Gregor A couple of years back
5635 2018-03-31 17:58:59 aw thats right and passion
5636 2018-03-31 17:58:53 Bracing? I was under the impression the people of BC hate oil (gas comes from oil in case you didn't know)? They should be dancing in the streets.
5637 2018-03-31 17:58:50 More misleading nonsense. Amazon is on many industries which would lead to a large single company lobbying group. Pick an industry they’re in, do they have more than the average pharm or oil company? How about the NRA? Has Amazon bought and paid for your party?
5638 2018-03-31 17:58:46 God is a product of intelligent design. Oil and gas not so much.
5639 2018-03-31 17:58:46 If you tell me pep running the EPL is because of oil money  you not allowed to talk football anymore, your football card has been permanently revoked. It helps to have money but that’s not why he dominating
5640 2018-03-31 17:58:44 And my Teacher didn't tell once Tz is mentioned in the so called "Region", it automatically exclude it from Sahara/SADEC/Oil rich regions/Equatorial regions and so overs!

5645 2018-03-31 17:58:17 Tfw the third-generation, two acre property you extorted from an elderly widower is found to be built on a gushing, orgiastic bounty of oil
5646 2018-03-31 17:58:16 That may be his motive, but, regardless, Amazon sure seems reminiscent of Standard Oil on the surface.  I'll let you and legal minds sort the facts.  Either way It is an important & fascinating case.  Great tweet.

5648 2018-03-31 17:58:04 @EPAScottPruitt, previously Oklahoma AG, not only did nothing to protect OK's property owners with even the slightest attempt to mitigate OK's oil and gas industry caused earthquakes but was actually in bed with the industry all along. He should never have been nominated for EPA.
5649 2018-03-31 17:58:03 @jackieaina just use tea tree oil, a natural remedy or see a dermatologist if it doesn’t clear up soon
5650 2018-03-31 17:57:57 @GiannaMiceli Nice twist for marketing your snake oil, like Stormy everyone has to make a living carry on.
5651 2018-03-31 17:57:20 Nooo use extra virgin olive oil or dripping
5652 2018-03-31 17:57:02 "my face produces enough oil daily to drown a small country"

an autobiography by me
5653 2018-03-31 17:56:59 It's literally one letter off from the thing he obviously meant. It was obviously a typo.

And "assault weapon" has a meaning. It might be ill-defined, but they clearly mean a specific general concept when they say it.
5654 2018-03-31 17:56:58 I hate getting my oil changed.
5655 2018-03-31 17:56:36 If the war is financial then the US will lose. Once Russia, China and Iran start trading oil in Yuan, the petrodollar crashes and confidence vanishes.

Eventually, nobody anywhere will want to touch dollars because they will be worthless.

The US will have to go to war.
5656 2018-03-31 17:56:23 Alberta’s current overall budget is boosted based on high oil royalty’s and that includes public sector pay
5657 2018-03-31 17:56:19 Yeah Coconut oil doesnt stick well. But I find that when I couple it with lotion or cream its good
5658 2018-03-31 17:56:06 Estoy muyyy manija con Fuel Oil hoy 
5659 2018-03-31 17:55:40 Come to my native, take your home one can of 15lts extract oil from my firms tasty coconut,

5667 2018-03-31 17:54:38 Why Stormy and associated stories keep popping up. Nothing to see, short diversion, then pivot back to Russia. Just stalling for time
5668 2018-03-31 17:54:34 Cooking oil/grease stains suck. They literally seep in and make a permanent home on your clothes.
5669 2018-03-31 17:54:16 With loans from the E.U, billed to the European citizens, yeah it's a fast growing economy. Plus the illegal ISIS oil trade,plus trafficking
5670 2018-03-31 17:54:07 ... and that without unlimited oil money!
5671 2018-03-31 17:53:32 Because petroleum is the parent product of all(crude oil). Original name of petrol is gasoline. Gasoline, diesel and other chemicals are derived from petroleum by distillation.
5672 2018-03-31 17:53:26 They are protecting their oil supply. To he'll with the truth.
5673 2018-03-31 17:53:24 Private property and no oil in the water please
5674 2018-03-31 17:53:16 I take a good multivitamin, evening primrose oil and glucosamine. Magnesium is a must for me.
5675 2018-03-31 17:53:14 « At a point of time, your government, your people, may say, “Wake up. (GAFA) are too big”, too big to be governed. You may choose to dismantle. That’s what happened at the very beginning of the oil sector when you had these big giants. That’s a competition issue. »
5676 2018-03-31 17:52:58 If you like all natural cures, check out CBD oil, hemp oil without the THC in it. Good for anxiety, insomnia, nausea, helps pain, the list goes on and on...for pain make sure it's REAL CBD oil, from a reputable company. Amazon didn't had real CBD, but worked for anxiety/insomnia!
5677 2018-03-31 17:52:49 Sooo.. we are talking about the same Craig button that called Nuge nothing better than third line center, same Craig button that had almost identical comments about Drai, in terms of the oil handling him. he is little more than a thinly veiled Calgary Flames supporter.. full stop
5678 2018-03-31 17:52:48 No. Finding an online business that isn't rubbish is the biggest hurdle. There is an endless stream of snake oil salesmen out there.
5679 2018-03-31 17:52:39 Lorenzo’s Oil
5680 2018-03-31 17:51:56 I had the same thing. I was putting jojoba oil every time I washed my hands to the bare nail. Or you could try apple cider vinegar. That works too.
5681 2018-03-31 17:51:45 So not only is @ScottPruittOK corrupt and hell bent on destroying the environment in the name of corporate (big oil and coal) profits, but he’s stupid, too. Get the feeling that both are considered bona fide “occupational qualifications” to be part of the Trump administration? 
5682 2018-03-31 17:51:42 Nuclear never delivered a low carbon state. In France it was supposed to deliver a low oil dependency and never did that. In Japan it even delivered a high fossil surge. In Denmark renewables successfully replaced coal. For the trolling, simply re-read your previous messages.
5683 2018-03-31 17:51:42 it's cbd oil but like, i am not convinced!!
5684 2018-03-31 17:51:41 It has everything to do with this comment.     No, you threw a random number out without quantifying at all what these jobs in B.C. for B.C. would specifically be doing... in fact, it sounds like you’re describing all the Alberta oil patch workers with that number.
5685 2018-03-31 17:51:36 I diluted tea tree oil with water and made sure to keep it dry! I didn’t put polish or anything on the nail while I waited for it to go away. I also took vitamins
5686 2018-03-31 17:51:23 ผมไม่รังเกียจคับ
5687 2018-03-31 17:51:18 oh ok, you say that while this lead tainted snake oil salesman "quotes" his child for twitter. Please.
5688 2018-03-31 17:51:14 The complete incomprehension of the difference between transactional global market pricing/trade finance/clearing and capital flows never ceases to amaze me. Shanghai contract primarily concerns oil market price levels with credit enhancement of teapot trades in Yuan secondary
5689 2018-03-31 17:51:09 Rub some lavender and eucalyptus oil (mixed with a carrier oil) on your neck. trust me it works wonders.
5690 2018-03-31 17:50:57 CBD oil is saving me from crippling anxiety
5691 2018-03-31 17:50:53 I put too much coconut oil in my hair 
5692 2018-03-31 17:50:22 I've been using carrot oil on my skin and wow! I'm walking gold 
5693 2018-03-31 17:50:18 Once again...absolutely nothing to do with the proposal increase oil tankers being loaded out of Westridge by 7 times. No one is disputing the current economic model for the oil sands, but you won’t increase production for the purpose of shipping that extra through BC to Asia.
5694 2018-03-31 17:50:05 Don’t lie to people have you been to cuba have you been to north korea it’s lacking enough oil because of sanctions they can’t feed people in their training camps
5695 2018-03-31 17:50:03 Choosing the right baby oil for my baby was a challenge as she has super sensitive skin like mine. Dove as a brand is very well known So when I came to know about Baby Dove Rich Moisture baby massage oil, I thought of giving it a try - and wasn't disappointed!
5696 2018-03-31 17:49:48 Literally everyone except the companies contracted to build the oil pipeline through Syria and those who have put money behind it
5697 2018-03-31 17:49:28 Made an awesome body and face oil last night! The big stars in it: marula, evening primrose, sea buckthorn, and essential oils of rose and helichrysum.

There's other carrier oils in there too, but in smaller amounts.
5698 2018-03-31 17:49:26 My facial hair grows so quick, and yet... it will not grow in new places  THIS is why ima look 16 forever. Damn the almond oil 
5699 2018-03-31 17:49:16 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
5700 2018-03-31 17:49:10 because our dependence on oil isn’t going anywhere soon, why can’t we do both, more people would agree on that.. invest in green renewables simultaneously  @jkenney should at least look like he is considering people’s concerns. for 40 yrs AB looks arrogant,  not a good look
5701 2018-03-31 17:48:59 I use coconut oil sparingly. It's very costly also. 
5702 2018-03-31 17:48:54 Peppermint oil. I swear it works to get rid of spiders. Although a shoe is a quicker fix.
5703 2018-03-31 17:48:52 she ate some this morning, i gave her a treat to try to give her an appetite and that seemed to work. idk if she ate all the food in her bowl, and it was her breakfast from yesterday... i'll try the vegetable oil tonight if she wont eat dinner tho
5704 2018-03-31 17:48:46 good points, i agree with you
5705 2018-03-31 17:48:44 Oh... anything that is deemed as safety component failure, then you get up to a max of £500; you pay only the first £35. 
Oil sensor.... I hope it's not that expensive....
Definitely it is worth to look into the AA breakdown repair cover if out of manufacturer's warranty :-)
5706 2018-03-31 17:48:31 "I just like caster oil!!!"

5708 2018-03-31 17:48:08 I think Putin and Trump are in agreement.  Trump kicking out Russians isn't going to bother Putin much,  and then Trump can decrease sanctions.  I think they bought that 19% of Russian oil co.  and will drill in the Arctic later on.  Follow the money.
5709 2018-03-31 17:48:06 Got a free car wash with my oil change, it’s the little things that can make me happy.....
5710 2018-03-31 17:48:03 Shoutout to @jiffylube - took my Acura in for an oil change when the light went off and they told me I didn’t actually need the change yet and they’d hate to charge me for something I don’t need. Plus they topped off other fluids for free. Great service
5711 2018-03-31 17:47:59 Lol Saudis offer Russia an oil deal. That's like offering ice to an Eskimo.

Were you involved in the law suit of Exxon and other oil companies over climate change re Richmond?
5716 2018-03-31 17:47:36 There's a huge oil truck blocking the ramp onto the freeway. My bus hasn't moved in 10 minutes. Oh and it's the only bus I can take to work.  Whooo. Good thing my shift doesn't start until noon. I MIGHT get there on time. #oneofthosedays
5717 2018-03-31 17:47:04 But he has popular oil friends that might buy memberships at Mar a Lago!
5718 2018-03-31 17:46:54 Sitting here getting my oil changed.
5719 2018-03-31 17:46:47 You know the opposite of separatist is "dependant" ? Let's talk economics....how did an oil rich country become so poor it's trillions in debt? Take your time.
5720 2018-03-31 17:46:31 Truelagen with coconut oil!! walang halong keme huhu
5721 2018-03-31 17:46:30 I gave my dad some money so he could could take mg car to get the oil change. But I got mad because he used the rest of the money to put gas
5722 2018-03-31 17:46:09 Lmao the only thing in my actual Easter basket is a giant thing of coconut oil 
5723 2018-03-31 17:46:07 Those who should know have to know. Public diff matter, largely just parrots. Gov has hard time functioning anyway Russian story not helping
5724 2018-03-31 17:46:05 By the way, please explain to me how keeping Canadian oil in the ground affects climate change? Not one of you can actually explain.
5725 2018-03-31 17:45:54 I wear lavender essential oil instead of perfume everyday because: 1) I like the way it smells and 2) everyone around me needs to chill tf out
5726 2018-03-31 17:45:52 I really really don’t want to get my oil changed today
5727 2018-03-31 17:45:51 Diluted in oil, we trust!
5728 2018-03-31 17:45:47 Heres somthing for ya..BP estimates that at the current rate of consumption...the world has enough oil for 68 yrs...providing that new fields are being discovered at the current rate....what if it decreases....research says the chances of it increasing are slim.
5729 2018-03-31 17:45:35 My oil is working!!
5730 2018-03-31 17:45:22 That has absolutely nothing to do with shipping oilbto Asia by oil tanker Ian. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #WaterIsLife

#AprilFoolsDay
5733 2018-03-31 17:45:03 Absolutely right! False propaganda by westerners to promote their oil!
5734 2018-03-31 17:44:52 AT&T and Standard Oil breakups were a net positive. Breakup of Google and Facebook would avoid the possibly ugly alternative of regulating their platforms as utilities.
5735 2018-03-31 17:44:45 So I just assumed but you can tailgate at Lucas Oil right?
5736 2018-03-31 17:44:43 I agree that this reflects mostly on the lawyer, but what Peterson was trying to sell on the stand was unscientific snake oil.
5737 2018-03-31 17:44:16 I just identified 29,000 jobs directly related not to mention jobs in BC as well NEBC jobs of supplying oil via pipelines to Alberta from B.C. Jobs of supporting the infrastructure. What about jobs with Sea Span.  NEB govJobs turnaround jobs. No benefit? 7x0 past tanker probs =0
5738 2018-03-31 17:44:13 Agree! Dr.B.M.Hegde speaks so high about coconut oil!
5739 2018-03-31 17:43:54 #firstworldproblems no WiFi as I sit here for oil change, transmission flush and inspection.  Everything I need to do today is in Azure 
5740 2018-03-31 17:43:54 Wait, I always assumed the “go easy on the chips” line was because they had Krillitane oil on them...
5741 2018-03-31 17:43:50 Oh nice. My sister is vegan so I know there's "ice cream" made with coconut oil base. I'm weaning myself from sugar so I was wondering if it's any good.
5742 2018-03-31 17:43:46 New air filter, oil changed, car washed, and all gassed up. Oh, and another bag of old sports games. All done before the rain come. By minutes. I am nailing this Saturday. 
5743 2018-03-31 17:43:38 im sorry i went scrolling thru ur twit to see more dog pics but also if she keeps having trouble eating sometimes you can drizzle a lil vegetable oil on the food to get them more interested (it's what we do at work anyways)
5744 2018-03-31 17:43:38 Palm oil is never sustainable, it’s the number one cause of deforestation

5746 2018-03-31 17:43:21 How about defending against the catastrophic spill of b.s. coming from this site onto twitter!  There is more crap/garbage flowing into the water, air and land from supposedly gov’t regulated sources w/o action than a “might happen” oil spill!!
5747 2018-03-31 17:43:16 Actually even industry called the tar sands for a long time. It was changed to the more accurate term oil sands fairly recently, mostly due to negative perception of 'tar'. To continue calling them tar sands is plain ignorance and overly dramatic.
5748 2018-03-31 17:42:55 Worse thing can happen is the fritters mix, plantain cut up and pot on the fire oly to realize nuh oil don't deh thete

5752 2018-03-31 17:42:20 @Justins why do so many of your products contain palm oil (one of the largest causes of deforestation)?
5753 2018-03-31 17:42:14 Why so much personal concern for me Ian and not the important discussion at hand? I’m not worried about BC energy jobs, I just dispute entirely what you are saying. That there are no B.C. Energy jobs in shipping oil to Asia by oil tanker. #bcpoli #cdnpoli

5761 2018-03-31 17:41:11 I name like every annoying person. Like “okay todd no oil cause of your allergy but you want extra gravy???” Makes no sense lmfao
5762 2018-03-31 17:41:04 Jeez...
Pep Boys actually BROKE my oil pan during an oil change last month...I am currently at the coffee shop while I wait for them to fix it. #ugh
5763 2018-03-31 17:41:03 @DynamoMagician_ cannabis oil. Will probably cure or greatly help your chrones
It can be legal. It’s certainly beneficial. Good luck.
5764 2018-03-31 17:40:40 This is a reality for oil and gas , our exports are lowering. You are the one using scare tactics based on what ifs
5765 2018-03-31 17:40:35 I call it appeasement, you call it avoiding tension.
Other than that your right.
5766 2018-03-31 17:40:31 I support your stance, therefore regret to say, California doesnt need the water import & has an overabundance of oil & refineries. California literally gives Mexico all the water & electricity it wants & pays other US states to take more electricity. Rivers & snow packs abound.
5767 2018-03-31 17:40:27 [shanghai spring rolls filled with braised cabbage and pork]
grandmas recipe!
first cut cabbage and pork until its thinly sliced pieces
uhh and then in a bowl add cooking wine and uh a couple scoops of Starch (thickener?) To the raw pork, mix that
pour oil in pan..
5768 2018-03-31 17:40:24 Here's the one from today's photo:
-Destem .66lb habaneros.  Char 6 peppers over open flame.  Cut all into halves.
-Saute peppers, 3 cloves garlic, .5tsp salt in oil for 20 minutes (do this outside...maybe)
-Cool pepper mixture.  Blend.  Add 4oz white vinegar, .5tsp brown sugar.
5769 2018-03-31 17:40:18 Why? Shut our borders. Bring our troops home. Stop killing Americans for the greed of oil. Build our southern and northern borders, patrol our coasts. Trap the rats already here. Kick them out. Become sovereign once again.

 Oh, and make DJT king .
5770 2018-03-31 17:40:15 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
5771 2018-03-31 17:40:07 RT if you believe in GOD!
G- gold
O- oil
D- drugs
5772 2018-03-31 17:40:07 @Deepak_Nathwani After trade war, next is currency war. China is taking its first step 2 pay 4 Oil import in yuan instead of the US Dollar.
5773 2018-03-31 17:40:00 Not defending conspiracy theories, but if there's evidence ...

Eg Russia did nationalise its bank; they did help Assad win, they are going to trade oil in Yuan; Genie will crash if Israel loses the Golan Heights.

I fear we are going to be dragged into a war we don't want.
5774 2018-03-31 17:39:19 Why souldnt Amazon be treated as Bell and Standard Oil were!  Of course there is no reason. Just more absurd ranting by lackies of hyperrich
5775 2018-03-31 17:39:11 when you're an oil stain artist.... 
5776 2018-03-31 17:38:53 By the feel of it, I'm probably the only Spurs fan that will not be congratulating #MCFC's title "win". Strange the number falling over themselves to pat them on the back.

City fans will say I'm jealous. Hardly. I just want football to win, not oil money. #AgainstModernFootball
5777 2018-03-31 17:38:52 Do you realize that from royalty dollars raised in BC from gas/oil forestry mining. 60% of these royalties come from NEBC?
5778 2018-03-31 17:38:03 Leftists whining about inequality give dirty Porsche driving millionaire cop hundreds of thousands. 
5779 2018-03-31 17:37:50 Covered in coconut oil doing work in the 5un at @TheLotRadio trying to get that ba5e tan
5780 2018-03-31 17:37:43 Great, soon that genius new Premier of theirs that complains about gas prices being too high will be without any oil + they can show the world how a province can go 100% oil free.  Like ripping off a bandaid, it would be kinder to force them to live their virtue signalling.
5781 2018-03-31 17:37:39 Any oil suggestions to help my beard grow 
5782 2018-03-31 17:37:36 I was trying to respond to a Golden Knights poll asking what should Tatar's nickname be-Tats or Tuna, but I ended up just tweeting an old S Padre fishing pic.  This is from a trip to Perdido oil rigs 100 miles out 2-4 yrs ago
5783 2018-03-31 17:37:26 That's a nail infection. I had one a few months ago. Just cut the nail & squeeze some tea tree oil in the nail skin. Do this everyday. It should clear up!
5784 2018-03-31 17:37:23 Next to Mother feed coconut oil is the one easily digests for new born babies speaks volumes about coconut oil. Wrong propaganda to promote edible cooking oils destroyed importance of Coconut oil. Kerala n TN lost a lot business due to this false propaganda, Marketing Conspiracy
5785 2018-03-31 17:37:11 Yep! And all the manufacturing he's brought back, and the coal mines he's opened, and we're becoming energy independent - by this time next year will will surpass Saudi Arabia as the top oil producer in the world. We're on a roll. Imagine where we'll be if Trump has 7 more years?
5786 2018-03-31 17:37:03 Lately baby always asking me to massages his back using vanilla oil, his back kinda stiff, I do know he working on housework, and his passion. I wish he know how to rest, then again I'm the same.

I kiss my baby's back, whispering "I'm here for you, sayang."
5787 2018-03-31 17:36:35 You know you’re tanning good when you’re drowning in a mixture of sweat and tanning oil
5788 2018-03-31 17:36:33 @westernlaw SoCalGas & Sempra executives covered up the very existence of the new Quantum_|_Quench(TM) technology. Does anyone care? No, because it wasn't invented by the oil & gas companies, or the government (which invests almost nothing in safety and mitigation R&D).
5789 2018-03-31 17:35:44 Now, instead of using rationale you’re using scare tactics. This about increasing existing production from the oil patch, not protecting existing jobs. You’re looking at increasing oil patch production so you can ship that extra to Asia through B.C. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #WaterIsLife
5790 2018-03-31 17:35:43 Getting my oil changed and all they got for me is infomercials on the damn tv. Help me. I don’t care about nutrisystem. 
5791 2018-03-31 17:35:31 Ghee? Why do  you want to dress the  Mahatma with a sparkling crown! A few drops of gingerly oil would be a more appropriate dressing for the white dressed Mahatma.
5792 2018-03-31 17:35:19 .@Facebook-Zerschlagung: Das Wollen/Sollen ist das eine. Mindestens ebenso interessant ist das Können. So einfach wie beim Klassiker Standard Oil wird es nicht gehen, oder, @michael_huether?
5793 2018-03-31 17:35:19 Maybe the odd tapestry ? The tweet’s been deleted , so I guess Frank’s back singing doowop around a burning oil drum somewhere downtown .
5794 2018-03-31 17:35:02 Coconut oil preforms magic on hair
5795 2018-03-31 17:34:51 @geography_411 . Russian need for natural resources has forced them to look for expansion because they are running low on important things like oil.
5796 2018-03-31 17:34:36 Giving all of Syria's oil to Iran - outrageous!
5797 2018-03-31 17:34:29 Islam and Muslims have been in America sense it's inception.  Muslims have been labeled extremists (made US war proxy) because oil is on their land. It has a cowboy and Indian vibe to it. Meaning, kick them off their land, exterminate them to bring in white settlers.
5798 2018-03-31 17:34:28 No justification for Europe's wealthiest country to have a second-tier domestic league. They have to relax the ownership rules. Bring all the oil sheikh money you can.
5799 2018-03-31 17:34:23 Did the cotton buds not push it too far in originally? I’m literally terrified of putting another back in? I’m gonna use the olive oil tonight... did you find that you had like a quiet hissing/white noise in the bunged up ear?
5800 2018-03-31 17:34:02 PSG Is a money team built from Saudi royal oil money. The one horse race in the Bundesliga is not Bayern’s fault. They’ve single handedly built themselves up to this level while others have failed to do so. A couple years ago, Dortmund actually gave Bayern a run for their money
5801 2018-03-31 17:33:41 I’m also doing fish oil and am on the lookout for bromeline...I probably rattle when I run!
5802 2018-03-31 17:33:40 Love writing stand-up comedy. Last night I struck oil!! Can't wait to perform this
5803 2018-03-31 17:33:25 Finally gonna try avocado oil for my hair. I keep hearing it’s the bees knees and all that fly shit lol
5804 2018-03-31 17:33:21 Until Trump hears about the oil under it.
5805 2018-03-31 17:33:18 เชช
5806 2018-03-31 17:33:14 Change my #Lancer to fully synthetic oil
5807 2018-03-31 17:33:05 "poor Scots economic growth.Note: Revenues  from North Sea oil and gas are not included in these figures"
5808 2018-03-31 17:32:41 it does. i encourage you to study about leviathan oil pipeline & Genie Oil see Israel has very little exports outside of weapons & tech and weapons are losing its cool in global arena,tech is reaching its bubble AGRO is mostly Palestinian but natural gas is abundant in GAZA
5809 2018-03-31 17:32:41 Just saying natural gas pipelines are not like oil or gasoline pipelines.
5810 2018-03-31 17:32:40 ขอบคุณนะคะ แล้วจะลองดูค่ะ
5811 2018-03-31 17:32:37 BC has not benefitted from the oil spill in Vancouver harbour. The owners of the oil tanker are refusing to pay clean up costs. I guess the people of Alberta will say its not their problem if the pipelines go through and tanker runs aground and their oil spills on BC Coast
5812 2018-03-31 17:32:31 I can’t believe this team have delivered early yet again. What an amazing platform this is. #GVT @genesis_vision are truly revolutionising #investing in #cryptocurrency #forex #oil #preciousmetal and #Stockmarket well done and thank you. #cryptonews
5813 2018-03-31 17:32:30 White smoke only happens when Danas changes the oil in the fryer.  Some say that hasn’t happened since before the Gillen era.
5814 2018-03-31 17:32:15 Oil, gas, coal, nuke banking and gun industry should all register you and your administration as lobbyists.
5815 2018-03-31 17:31:57 self financing ????  Yes by an Oil Rich owner. Accounts can be doctored by any decent accountant but everyone knows where the money comes from.  Didn't see them challenging 10 or so years ago.
5816 2018-03-31 17:31:53 done got my baby an oil change, car wash & filled her up
5817 2018-03-31 17:31:52 Russian oligarchs and mercenaries have tried to lay siege to oil fields in Syria, and have been repelled by US troops.
5818 2018-03-31 17:31:32 What's In My Hair,
March 31, 2018 Edition:

Crude oil and turquoise buttercream frosting
5819 2018-03-31 17:31:28 No itch. Searches brought up tea tree oil bodywash so I've been qtipping 100% tea tree oil on it. Just flipping out, no big deal.
5820 2018-03-31 17:31:22 Still got some oil come get it
5821 2018-03-31 17:31:08 Oatmeal bath and a little lavender oil. 
5822 2018-03-31 17:31:06 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
5823 2018-03-31 17:31:05 Pruitt worked or works for oil and gas. Defended those companies as attorney in Oklahoma.
5824 2018-03-31 17:30:57 tea tree oil. or warm salt water solution
5825 2018-03-31 17:30:49 Because the US was the  buyer of ur oil,  when dey stopped oil prices crashed....  Pay ur workers there gratuity nd stop wailing
5826 2018-03-31 17:30:46 $80 for a oil Change smh
5827 2018-03-31 17:30:18 You almost certain have.

Second question? Calf milk replacer usually contains soybean oil.
5828 2018-03-31 17:30:04 1st gig done now I’m finally changing my oil
5829 2018-03-31 17:29:56 stuck at the dealership waiting for an oil change. any fic rec’s to keep me busy?!
5830 2018-03-31 17:29:45 Bizarre how the *West coast* shipping access is in Canada & belongs to everyone, but OIL is only in Alberta, not Canada. It is the worst kind of convenient logical inconsistency.

#ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli
5831 2018-03-31 17:29:35 No, you threw a random number out without quantifying at all what these jobs in B.C. for B.C. would specifically be doing... in fact, it sounds like you’re describing all the Alberta oil patch workers with that number.
5832 2018-03-31 17:29:31 Lol!! Hey!! Let’s all go to Kuwait & demand our oil stipend, swing by Germany & get our teeth fixed for free, go by KSA and get a lifetime of free gas..... because they wouldn’t see that as “illegal”.
5833 2018-03-31 17:29:22 #UnpopularOpinion stop saying “fighting for our freedom” like we aren’t already free. we won our freedom in 1776, nowadays we fight for who has the most oil.
5834 2018-03-31 17:28:58 @MizzouBaseball just walked into Jim N Nicks here at Auburn for a pregame meal before the @AuburnBaseball game. I am running back into kitchen and dumping castor oil into their BBQ sauce which should make for some entertaining innings!!! War Damn Eagle!
5835 2018-03-31 17:28:58 Time to be an adult and go get an oil change
5836 2018-03-31 17:28:42 The sun should give me back the oil it evaporated
5837 2018-03-31 17:28:39 I walked to Olive Garden while waiting on my car to finish being inspected and get the oil changed. This walk back being full about to be crucial 
5838 2018-03-31 17:28:34 @AshleyEmmax Your nightshows just captivate me like no others. Long may you grace our screens. Simply brilliant . Hoping for oil tonight 
5839 2018-03-31 17:28:29 It may have been 55. I remember mom saying we were out of school 4 days. We had oil heat & ran out of oil. Mom & my little brother 3 blocks to get some oil & saying it took them 45 minutes. Dad was in CA to see grandpa (who died in 9/57) will see if I can get more definite info.
5840 2018-03-31 17:28:26 Getting my oil changed always involves awkward waiting room experiences
5841 2018-03-31 17:28:26 breakfast, kitchen cleaned, dogs fed, grass cut, and oil change all before one. i’d day today is already pretty productive.
5842 2018-03-31 17:28:24 parang naglagay lang ako ng moisturizer kanina dahil dun sa liquid foundation, potek nag oil up pa ko hahaha wtf
5843 2018-03-31 17:28:02 kuya olive oil pa wave din uy!!
5844 2018-03-31 17:27:53 Do a coating of diluted tea tree oil and cover in flax seed gel. I did that once a night for a week
5845 2018-03-31 17:27:48 Honestly just want to move to a place where no dumbass oil company can take over and screw over the beautiful view
5846 2018-03-31 17:27:43 Oh, I thought it was because oil rigs were visible from Mar-a-Lago, which is a no-no. 
5847 2018-03-31 17:27:34 Baby oil, yo
5848 2018-03-31 17:27:15 Thanks. It should. I'm hoping to use oil paints which are brilliant!

Nevermind just put some oil in the middle 
And jump off....thats it.....
5851 2018-03-31 17:26:33 Trump must be thinking: “Pruitt is doing his best to allow big oil and coal to destroy the environment in the name of corporate profits. Why does he have to ruin things by acting like a petty crook, too?”
5852 2018-03-31 17:26:22 Places use fish oil to cook other things besides fish?
5853 2018-03-31 17:26:22 The snake oil salesman looked for commonality among the low income, uneducated and found it.
Permission to hate and blame a race of men for all their own shortcomings. That would be the hook.
The angry posse formed. They took the bait.

5855 2018-03-31 17:26:05 I need to buy some coconut oil. Facts
5856 2018-03-31 17:26:02 A question?Why didn’t the O&G, FED gov and AB gov not get out in front of the “dirty oil” narrative instead of just ignore it? That social license would have defended our industry here and stopped the world crapping on us while  eroding our market share?
5857 2018-03-31 17:25:41 No Adrian you should be invited in properly one day for a look around. @eddietemple1471 is sitting here agreeing with me. You have always supported the Weald and put so much effort in for investors. I think it would be a lovely touch on their behalf and also would be great for PR
5858 2018-03-31 17:25:24 The bigger problem is that everywhere uses fish oil and truffle. Onions make me sick, but the other 2 can kill me.
5859 2018-03-31 17:25:22 I am lowkey panicking & in tears bc this patch of rash on my stomach where my gross cat and my equally gross nephew scratched me... started another like 2 inches away.  Flipping OUT.
I've been burning it with teatree oil & the weak otc ointments available without copay.
5860 2018-03-31 17:25:10 Uber is the greatest invention (next to the smart phone) of our time. How else could I get to the bank, post office, and nail shop all while getting an oil change and tire rotation? And for $10 round trip?
5861 2018-03-31 17:25:10 Spending some quality time with Dad today! 
Fixing my car, listening to some good country music, and sharing some laughs. I'm covered in oil and grease, haha! It's a good day!
5862 2018-03-31 17:25:09 Walking around @Target like an idiot looking for an oil diffuser because no one who works at target knows what section it would be

5864 2018-03-31 17:25:07 #designsessionslive If you really want super hardy pillows, go with indoor/outdoor pillows. Not as comfortable but super stain resistant. Also, choose pillows with zippers so you can wash them when needed. AVOID silk... it soaks up oil and dirt.
5865 2018-03-31 17:25:03 Until @Ninjanomics101 mentioned embezzling I figured the Corvica wealth was self-made, and if you're rich enough to have a winery I would assume he embezzled from a crime syndicate (Did he also import olive oil?)

Which made me think Poffa was one of the syndicate's enforcers
5866 2018-03-31 17:24:54 Tea tree oil. It’s a fungus.
5867 2018-03-31 17:24:47 time to get this oil change finally

5878 2018-03-31 17:23:59 By that logic, why not just give it to the best player on whatever team wins the President's Trophy? 

Next year McDavid has exactly the same season, but better depth on wings and goaltending, Oil make playoffs...suddenly he's *more* valuable? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5879 2018-03-31 17:23:55 Oh Sam, you asked for olive oil for Christmas - this is beyond cute!I shouldn't be too surprised...I still remember you saying you spent around £90 on a chopping board when you were about 18..."it'll last me!"... So this is nothing really. xx

5883 2018-03-31 17:23:39 you can only try so hard with the players that are at your disposal. maybe if the rest of them were all sponsored by an Oil rich state then it'd be more competitive. Or maybe restrict the amount of spending.
5884 2018-03-31 17:23:14 social media “vetting” for visas???? seriously??? alright kids anyone who shared american oil memes can’t come into the country
5885 2018-03-31 17:22:27 A lady is on the service drive crying because we don't have an oil filter for her car.

5899 2018-03-31 17:21:06 Yes, to a large degree, Bitcoin is currently like crude oil; it is "mined" from proven reserves, it's possible to "transact" in crude (e.g. crude oil swaps) and it is "stored" as a strategic reserve. But mining crude for mining sake wouldn't make sense.
5900 2018-03-31 17:20:57 Do you even KNOW how to tell the truth? It looks alot like this: . Youve been given the time, you have been weighed, measured, & found lacking. If you cant promote truth, at least stop selling the snake oil.
5901 2018-03-31 17:20:52 Also by defeating the west backed jihadis they have stopped the next stage which was taking out Iran. That has put back Zionist plans for an expansion of Israel and buggered the Genie Oil deal (owned by Murdoch, Rumsfeld and Rothschild) lots of reasons not to be happy with Russia
5902 2018-03-31 17:20:50 And the way they  keep  Bio oil locked in supermarket. Someone must open for you to buy it,

5907 2018-03-31 17:20:39 when my simple oil change & rotating tires turns into needing new tires, brake pads, fluid changes, and other stuff for ~ $1500

thinking of starting a gofundme
5908 2018-03-31 17:20:37 No need. They are very selective and their selections often seem to match those of the US/UK war machine. Oil, contrarian nationalistic rulers trying to exercise their sovereignty, talk of forming close ties with BRICS and having a redistributive economic policy...all seem to ...
5909 2018-03-31 17:20:28 Kenyans made the Constitution. Made, Prof. Because constitution is not made every day!
5910 2018-03-31 17:20:17 Sounds like price gouging if the American people.  Oil companies should be charged a hefty fine.
5911 2018-03-31 17:20:07 I have to be at work for 1 and they just now changing my oil  I been here since 10
5912 2018-03-31 17:20:02 They are but their achievements will never be recognised in the same way as ours as it's been done with the limitless resources of an oil state
5913 2018-03-31 17:20:02 #TRIn @IChronicle @Schroders @SHARESmag Have you taken a look at this exciting aim oiler which is making money , it’s starting to hit a few more radars #TRIn great team with some of the lowest costs for producing oil

5920 2018-03-31 17:19:06 yea it’s been growing out! do you dilute the tea tree oil? and is this a soaking process or do you apply it on top of the nail like a cuticle oil

5922 2018-03-31 17:18:54 He fucked Oklahoma over! I need to research what happened to the OK investigation on him. He has his head so far up the oil industry butt.
5923 2018-03-31 17:18:20 You have some strange myopia. What caused the other recessions?  Oil had nothing to do with 70s (bit unstable)?  It was all gold?   There are far more consistent narratives than the non-existent “libertarianism” of the 80s. workforce growth, productivity changes, trans dereg etc
5924 2018-03-31 17:18:17 Money well spent...trust me...actually I didn’t buy it. Got 3 bottles from the wife n mum n dad for Christmas...that’s how sad I am...I asked for olive oil.  Sam x
5925 2018-03-31 17:18:11 Tea tree oil will help it disappear faster. But you have to continue to cut the nail and let it grow out
5926 2018-03-31 17:17:57 The trump administration, and the Pruitt sees The role of the EPA, is to assist corporations in extracting oil, gas, coal, minerals from the earth. Protecting the environment? Not really their agenda. “Remove barriers”, reduce regulation, Look the other way

5936 2018-03-31 17:17:11 Between you, me & Twitter, I bought a strong borehole in abundant group of aquifers, to avoid the dry tap. Water is to 21st century as oil was to last. If we manage it, we'll be fine.

But we can't even look after each other and nature yet, so drill that hole now, to groundwater.
5937 2018-03-31 17:17:09 National Oil n Gas exploration companies are now pushing their self more for finding new well, as they woke up when its late. Shale o&g reserve are much much more but technology is costly. Similar, exploration n extraction of minerals frm KP/Balochistan are not as fast/ effective

5939 2018-03-31 17:17:04 there are precedents. at&t in the 1980s. standard oil in the 1910s. i think it'll happen in the 2020s
5940 2018-03-31 17:17:02 You are an alien...a foreigner! Why is the government not harassing you? We know you need the donor fund, but stop stooping this low for the same!
5941 2018-03-31 17:16:50 Like I said yesterday, Nigeria now produces more oil, bunkering is on the low, TSA is working, Naira has been devalued, subsidy has been removed (although we now have NNPC under-recovery). Clearly, this government should have more Naira to spend even at $60 oil.
5942 2018-03-31 17:16:50 A govt yet to account 4 $26b (N9t)stolen through Corrupt Oil contracts in NNPC, but PMB is Fighting Corruption.

5961 2018-03-31 17:14:42 “Something I’ll never forget.” Just the simple fact it was at Lucas Oil in Indy and NOT the Texans stadium. Oops
5962 2018-03-31 17:14:38 I am a believer!  Use oil everyday for pain. Sleep and anxiety.

5964 2018-03-31 17:14:26 Well a team that spent an average of 60m per PLAYER...i mean you should be magnificent. 2.2 billion in 7 years. Oil money. Less than a decade ago it was so different. It's not all so magnificent. It's a pure money drive. Happening in Rugby now too. All wrong.

5970 2018-03-31 17:14:01 Man United’s treble team and Arsenal’s invincibles were both better. Neither needed £3bn worth of oil money either 

If City are better why can’t they go unbeaten? They have more money than any club in history and Wenger did it on a Primark budget

5977 2018-03-31 17:13:21 Times reports carmakers asked for LESS relaxation than Trump Pruitt gang are going to order. I think it is to benefit Oil industry far more than car industry that has already invested big in retooling for efficiency, shifting partly to hybrids & Electric Vehicles (EV) like Bolt.

5980 2018-03-31 17:12:35 In a related story, Russia made billions selling oil in 1970s oil crisis. Oil exports plunged in 1980s. Russia bad economy in 1980s

5984 2018-03-31 17:12:25 Have you, a marine biologist,  noticed how the trump admin. brings out the ugliest policies re:environment? As per trump: it's okay to drill in national parks, kill hibernating bears & their cubs, to drill on our coasts, trophy hunting is okay, wants coal & oil to be king.
5985 2018-03-31 17:12:13 if you got a piercing recently and now you have a bump next to the piercing that looks like a pimple .. it's not it's a keloid.. best way to get rid of it : don't touch it don't pick at it and 4 times a day put a drop of pure tea tree oil on it promise it works
5986 2018-03-31 17:12:10 We understand liberals tax people more but the price of oil dropped like a rock in 2015. Canada's most profitable industry was oil last time I checked.
5987 2018-03-31 17:12:06 So I took my car for an oil change for the first time by myself  also since I’m going home in about a week and a half I had them check everything and luckily everything was good

5991 2018-03-31 17:12:01 There is another way of looking at this data -

Subbarao - 2008 - 2013
Rajan        - 2013 - 2016

Because primary role inflation management using monetary tools, were that of RBI.

- Plus external factors like softening OIL prices
- Government fiscal policies & MSP prices.
5992 2018-03-31 17:11:44 if your man takes his car to the mechanic to get his oil changed, he ain’t the one
5993 2018-03-31 17:11:23 Oil changes are not as bad as getting bigger things
5994 2018-03-31 17:11:21 toda la corporación de los sobres desacreditando a funcionarios probos y hasta hoy éticos, se nota que Cristóbal repartió sobres, porque Oil combustible ya está prácticamente en la quiebra
5995 2018-03-31 17:11:12 N what for all those resources n oil?!To buy a ticket to paradise or bail out of the hell?! How is it possible to try to lead the World in "national interests"?! When they'll(notorious deep state n elite)recognize,that they aren't becoming happier with their decisions n actions.

6009 2018-03-31 17:10:08 so an organisation thats been funded for years by the Oil industry says the SNP are performing badly.... theres a shocker.
6010 2018-03-31 17:10:06 I'm not pretending that killing animals is the only issue. I'm on your side with this. We should stop killing animals, and stop funding the corrupt harmful corn, soy, and palm oil industries as well. There are many issues to tackle. Peace is the goal.
6011 2018-03-31 17:10:00 Yea I buy a fairly bland olive oil for the pigs in Aldi. I’d use it I think rather than a really good one.
6012 2018-03-31 17:09:56 so this dude came in to change his oil this morning and when it was time for@him to come to me so he can pay. he asked me what’s my name so i told@him and he was like do u have any kids? i said no! he was like well that’s good. so he finally paid n left.....

6021 2018-03-31 17:08:39 We’re overspending oil merchants and there’s nothing you can do about it.
6022 2018-03-31 17:08:38 Of course he does and so does Amazon. So do all the oil companies who get subsidies etc. Same with all big business taking from taxpayers. But Trump and his band of grifters is not the place I would start for wisdom in this
6023 2018-03-31 17:08:16 Oh come on! Go home and dont steal Syrian oil!

6032 2018-03-31 17:07:07 Maybe you should take that hint and actually do something positive like investigating claims instead of shopping for $30k+ furniture. Go back to selling snake oil to the gullible. #TrumpsMorons #Huckster #HowDoesHeStillHaveAJob
6033 2018-03-31 17:06:58 You can stretch it to five but outside of Donaldson there isn't much there to even get opposing teams worried. It's crazy how much their roster has changed since 2016 & outside of Grichuk, none are viable younger options.
6034 2018-03-31 17:06:53 yes, and i'm really excited for when i finally get up-to-date, because i am so so so ready to break out the mid-atlantic oil rig worker accent

1. Plan to trade oil with the Chinese in Yuan, rather than USD.

2. Helped Assad beat the UK/US backed jihadis in Syria - so no US Syrian pipeline.

6184 2018-03-31 16:48:45 Thieves oil.
6185 2018-03-31 16:48:39 My favorite thing on a recipe review is when someone posts something like, “I subbed five of the six ingredients, left out the oil and made it vegan. One star. Tasted like shit.”
6186 2018-03-31 16:48:28 I dont know abt the amount of oil there But in the past they did some OP that we say: swap or something like that for oil.
6187 2018-03-31 16:48:16 The conspiracy theory is that he developed this + a way of extracting unlimited electricity from the atmosphere. But it was suppressed by Edison/ Standard Oil Company/ Illuminati/ the Lizard People. 
6188 2018-03-31 16:47:57 Shipping foreign oil now ?   Lmfao
6189 2018-03-31 16:47:53 だよな
6190 2018-03-31 16:47:41 Yeah, like a Sec State owned by an oil company... like putting your daughter and son in law in powerful positions, like elevating your personal doctor to Sec VA, like having a bunch of interns all related to friends and cronies... Its out of control
6191 2018-03-31 16:47:28 If you hadn't done such a shitty job when you were running the country maybe times wouldn't be bad elsewhere.  If your government hadn't gutted BC's coast guard it wouldn't need to be rebuilt before oil flows.
6192 2018-03-31 16:47:26 All CDN’s are targeted immigrants, our forefathers were homsteaders, developed industries such as oil,mining, ranching, forestry etc,all ind that continue to be Cda’s economic engine, your forefathers were gov drones or worked in the pig plant in Toronto, or hogtown

6194 2018-03-31 16:47:18 @chigrl noted the "big buyers of physical" nature of the oil contract last week.  USD does not buy large amounts of physical gold, only paper.  China seems to prefer physical, at least relative to leverage levels of USD gold mkts...
6195 2018-03-31 16:47:08 I discovered him in the Hunter museum in Chattanooga and became obsessed. He went to Cleveland Art Institute. In addition to his shimmery landscapes, he painted somber scenes of coal mines and middle class homes. And as bright as his landscapes are, they are watercolor, not oil!
6196 2018-03-31 16:47:05 It would seem that “standing up for Alberta” = standing up for oil companies, no matter the party, and most of the press goes along.
6197 2018-03-31 16:46:55 Exactly , Syrian oil production may be somewhat meaningful to Syria , but Syria isn’t in OPEC. It’s oil production is irrelevant on the world stage.
6198 2018-03-31 16:46:53 People, be careful when cooking with oil. Even if it's a little, it can still jump out and burn your cheek and arm.
6199 2018-03-31 16:46:44 コラだとは思ったけどやっぱそうだったのか
6200 2018-03-31 16:46:44 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
6201 2018-03-31 16:46:30 I don't think so. Israel has to deal with Quneitra/Daraa in coming years & the trade line betwn Tehran-Iraq-Damascus is already established. Moreover, EU/USA won't support the Syrian reconstruction & Damascus needs to look somewhere else. Also, the Mediterranean oil is promising.
6202 2018-03-31 16:46:20 Could you use like baby oil or something super slick to make it easier to slide out or something? Is it a rock?
6203 2018-03-31 16:46:12 I am all for equal opportunity criticism, but these proclanations when presidents have done dubious stuff back to founders. Bush, Saudi, CIA in 70s, money, oil, even trusts and civil war. Crazy to think money not involved. Business and political power has been entwined since ever
6204 2018-03-31 16:45:54 "According to the proposed plan, Beijing would start with purchases from Russia and Angola, two nations which, like China, are keen to break the dollar’s global dominance. They are also two of the top suppliers of crude oil to China, along with Saudi Arabia."

6207 2018-03-31 16:45:30 You haven’t identified any real employment outside the oil patch yet! Where are these 29 000 jobs you are talking about? These are oil patch jobs you are already counting, jobs that would continue up there whether Canada decides to ship oil through B.C. by oil tanker or not.

6210 2018-03-31 16:44:48 OLIVE the FACTS #6: @SistemaOrgana says  -- almost 50% of Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes from Spain, whose most popular olive is the #PICTUAL olive! #pictualperfect #olivethefacts #olivefacts #oliveoil #infusedoilsandvinegars #chefmichelle #ordinarytoextraordinary

6221 2018-03-31 16:43:32 Agree. It doesn't make any sense. The Oil in Deir-ezzour belongs to Syria and Iran has plenty of oil to dig its hands into the north-east Syrian oil.

6229 2018-03-31 16:42:38 I imagine policy makers believe that holding onto Syria oil, blocking trade and forbidding international organizations from helping w reconstruction will turn Syria  into a quagmire & protect Israel

6231 2018-03-31 16:42:26 Just using one issue as an example, is the Utah Gov really wanting to deny medical marijuana to infants & children who were born with a repetitive seizure syndrom, having multiple seizures all day every day ? The marijuana oil allows them to lead normal lives.

6234 2018-03-31 16:42:09 The truth is that this is not about any economic gain for B.C. at all, even though you and @sjmuir are promoting it to be about that. It’s about shipping foreign oil to foreign shores for Alberta Oil Tax revenue at B.C.’s environmental risk...putting B.C. Tourism at risk. #bcpoli

6244 2018-03-31 16:40:41 After Arab oil embargo the Tory government adopted a neutral stance in the Middle East.
What has ever happened to that policy?
Party political shift across spectrum has sadly pro-Israel over the years including New Labour.
Labour has rare opportunity righting wrongs of the past.

6251 2018-03-31 16:40:00 Why the US cares if the Iranian government has control of the oil wells or if the US does, is a mystery. The oil isn’t even enough to pay for local government, not to mention Iran gov.

6258 2018-03-31 16:39:13 Electricity isn't magic. If we are writing the obituary on oil with such exuberance, we better dam well be investing in EV infastructure before we install the headstone.
6259 2018-03-31 16:39:09 So it could collapse at any point is what you are saying? We have no back-up plan? Its like a house of cards or a jenga tower? The Govt is not allowing us to have even an oil reserve to fall back on.....

6267 2018-03-31 16:37:53 Pruitt is so deep in the pocket of the oil lobby. Always has been since he was AG in OK. He’s the reason why it’s illegal to oppose fracking in OK & they have thousands of earthquakes a year. The environment’s worst nightmare.

6289 2018-03-31 16:35:09 I agree, and norway is propped up with oil/gas revenue. But its better than being stuck in the current American nightmare. We can never have economic justice until workers power is on par with corporations.  Labor unions and removing money from politics is only hope.

6293 2018-03-31 16:34:30 So was Standard Oil.
6294 2018-03-31 16:34:27 Should Alberta slowly decrease the amount of oil and gas shipments to B.C. until B.C. stops dumping RAW SEWAGE INTO THE OCEAN?  B.C. Presently dumps 29.6 BILLION LITRES A YEAR.

6306 2018-03-31 16:33:06 Canada has the worlds 2nd largest KNOWN reserves of oil and gas on the planet, yet we pay some of the highest prices at the pump in the world - half of which is municipal, provincial, and federal tax.  This is just greedy government theft.
6307 2018-03-31 16:32:55 It’s actually really hard to ignite engine oil. It’s gotta be heated to flash point (about 400 degrees) first. Even an open flame won’t do it.
6308 2018-03-31 16:32:51 Note to self: raw garlic is an antimicrobial.  Next time you want that much garlic in a sauce, maybe sauté it lightly first. 

Second note to self: replace essential oil diffuser in bathroom.

6320 2018-03-31 16:30:57 I think my cat could do a better job running the VA than the Obama administration did.
6321 2018-03-31 16:30:52 me every day after using a tea tree oil face wash, tea tree water toner, and an oil-control gel as moisturizer: why is my skin so dry
6322 2018-03-31 16:30:48 Yes I do! I will also take a spoon full of coconut oil for the same reason. Quick source of fuel for energy and keeps me focused.  I recommend you try it
6323 2018-03-31 16:30:45 Pruitt has been funded by Oil and Gas industry for his political career. He's in their pocket so he's eliminating regulations that protect Americans from fossil fuel pollution and denying Science as he establishes his credentials for a 2020 Senate run. Pruitt: Real bad for USA.
6324 2018-03-31 16:30:35 you do realize that this tweet is based on fake "facts"... you do realize that now don't you... or, as I suspect using your distraction tactics from "other" factual news items, truth is irrelevant... your minions will buy your snake oil...
6325 2018-03-31 16:30:28 Use salt to wash your hands. I actually do oil + salt combo, then soap. May God be with you
6326 2018-03-31 16:30:14 Americans want to watch this Shanghai International Energy Exchange because this is what is going to start the next war. The selling of Oil in non US dollars is why Iraq and Libya were attacked and the exchange is backed by Gold.
6327 2018-03-31 16:30:06 Factors influencing the determination of astaxanthin within oil bodies of Ganoderma lucidum.
6328 2018-03-31 16:30:06 This may hurt my chances of getting into a doctoral program, but Cannabis, CBD, hemp oil, clean eating, alkalized water, and ample sunlight provide the best outcomes for people dealing with any form of cancer.  If I am wrong, admit me and prove me wrong.
6329 2018-03-31 16:29:43 That's great that CBD oil helps you! I haven't had much luck with it, but I know others that it's helped.

6331 2018-03-31 16:29:26 What is up with people over escalating a simple problem these days? "Here you go ma'am. I cleaned out your car for free after we did your oil change"

"Wha#$%T?!?!."

Car is now set on fire with her screaming "I didn't ask for a car wash!!!"
6332 2018-03-31 16:29:14 not nearly as much as in the South/flyover states but NW MT has it's own little bible belt which also is white supremacist central
 I'd say state religion of MT is Church of Antigovernment ironic bc MT relies heavily on Fed funds-farm subsidies, oil gas leases tourism on Fed land
6333 2018-03-31 16:29:11 @bophelo_rooimes  I mean the ingredients to the finished product baby oil like you asked.  Maybe I didn't see correctly to your tweets?
6334 2018-03-31 16:29:04 I suffer with chronic pain due to orthopaedic problems & have started taking CBD oil capsules
6335 2018-03-31 16:28:56 I use the oil drops in the vape.
6336 2018-03-31 16:28:55 I’m about to go grab my son’s baby oil and look at the ingredients, just to put my mind at ease 
6337 2018-03-31 16:28:50 99% of college coaches can be called a snake oil salesman its that they have to do. He will bring in talent and he will have kids wanting to play. It comes down to growing as a coach. Not much difference between Willie and Dan. Both have a lot to prove
6338 2018-03-31 16:28:45 I feel for them too.
Still, you can look back to the 70s Oil Crisis for fair warning of price hikes.
There are more fuel efficient vehicles available, manufacturers choose not to sell them in our market because we prefer to complain about policy than to actually change habits.
6339 2018-03-31 16:28:33 can ppl really not guess that i’m either engaged or married with a ring on my finger??????? why i always get hit on at the gas station or when i get my oil change???? leave me alooooone

6341 2018-03-31 16:28:02 The better question is why are taxpayers paying for Pruitt & aides to fly first class around the world shilling for oil/gas companies? That IS NOT in the job description! He needs to pay all that money back!
6342 2018-03-31 16:27:58 When one won’t .. the other will ... @Valvoline across the street took my business right away ... changing my oil as we tweet

6348 2018-03-31 16:27:08 He is what people talk about when saying resource extraction is bad for democracy. He will bring an end to any relationship Alberta had with the rest of Canada. They don’t realize that they don’t have quite enough water to bring all their oil to market.

6350 2018-03-31 16:27:00 Next week I must concentrate, and get back to working on this oil of Jarrold’s Corner. I have been enjoying the painting and thus far it seems to have gone OK. I must work now on getting it completed, but a bit to do yet.

6353 2018-03-31 16:26:45 I’m on my lunch break and almost falling asleep. How am I gonna drive home and get my oil changed and go to the library like I planned if I’m already on the verge of sleeping where I sit????

6357 2018-03-31 16:26:17 If you can just wait a couple days without showering you won’t produce as much oil to make your hair greasy. Since you strip it everyday it will over produce oils and dry out your hair making it greasy and not healthy. If you can get over the hump of 3 days, you won’t get greasy.
6358 2018-03-31 16:26:14 It's in the oven. The raw mixture tastes just as if I used butter. Used plain olive oil. Used an 8 inch tin and set the clock for 35 minutes. Dead easy to make.
6359 2018-03-31 16:25:50 respiratory issues so cannot smoke anything and just passive scent of nearby smoking it that has made me unwell in the past considering the oil forms though
6360 2018-03-31 16:25:18 Sure. Let’s laud him for his tough guy pipeline persona & not raise alarms about the social chaos he’ll sow. Vulnerable men, women, & children chewed up by his regressive ideologies - education, health care, welfare, etc.

But oil. So, whatevs.

6364 2018-03-31 16:24:55 Food prep.. salads.. albeit not the weather for salads as yet.. Couscous, aubergine, courgette, olive, and roast beef. An aubergine risotto (not salad!).. And a tofu cabbage ginger chilli garlic noodle salad with sesame oil and soya sauce. Plus chocolate-silken tofu mini mousses.
6365 2018-03-31 16:24:24 So if he pulls out of Syria, loses the oil, gives a victory to Iran, and in all other ways go against everything he said about this stuff during his campaign... will people finally believe he’s taking his orders from Putin?

6375 2018-03-31 16:22:30 I just identified 29,000 jobs directly related not to mention jobs in BC as well NEBC jobs of supplying oil via pipelines to Alberta from B.C. Jobs of supporting the infrastructure. What about jobs with Sea Span.  NEB govJobs turnaround jobs. No benefit? 7x0 past tanker probs =0
6376 2018-03-31 16:22:29 We just need to look out side the box for solutions. I know how we can pay for the wall and help another country as well as our own at the same time. Commodities such as oil, gold, diamonds,etc can contribute trillions to the reframing of countries. But China is beating us to it.
6377 2018-03-31 16:22:06 It's never happened to me that's why I said that. Also I suppose it depends on the meat and the type of olive oil

Why you ask?
Because they have more oil than any other country.

6387 2018-03-31 16:20:31 Thanks to a fairly steady diet of exfoliating with a Japanese Salic cloth and marinating in coconut oil, my skin is buttery soft and I felt the need to share this with the world. Self care is quality exfoliation and mousturization, my friends.
6388 2018-03-31 16:20:18 I live in a state that would rather have their teachers strike than raise taxes on oil and wind.
6389 2018-03-31 16:19:58 And of course none of those resolutions against Israel has anything to do with the UN prostituting them self for the Arab oil dollars does it? It's the UNs standard MO.  They got 970 mil of those dollars this past week.
6390 2018-03-31 16:19:57 Once again though, you’re trying to make this about me instead of what it’s really about...and that’s foreign oil companies shipping oil to foreign shores through our coast and at our risk. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #WaterIsLife #StopKM

6396 2018-03-31 16:18:37 Rolling back miles per gallon requirements for cars will help the oil companies but hurt American's pocketbooks and lungs.
6397 2018-03-31 16:18:33 Welcome to Walmart: where you’ll spend four hours on an oil change and tire rotation.
6398 2018-03-31 16:18:27 my dad used to do my oil changes and now i have to go somewhere where they ask me questions about my car idk the answers to 
6399 2018-03-31 16:18:14 Standard response should be," I am married with 2 children and a mortgage, my car has an oil leak and needs a new rear tyre. The in-laws are coming over this weekend and to top it all off, my dog just died." That would stop her in her tracks and ruin her evening. lol

6408 2018-03-31 16:16:55 in every video this ASMR lady puts barely a sprinkle of oil on her pasta, and now we’ve got noodles drowning in sauce. I continue to be mystified by the human condition

6415 2018-03-31 16:15:56 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
6416 2018-03-31 16:15:39 A lot of things were said about last Republican Presidency.. Bush Jr & Cheney ..  Middle East Conflict was a agenda ( oil) but no Bush Jr. or Cheney operatives or stooges  ( well those not caught) sneaking around making deals with our enemies.

6427 2018-03-31 16:14:18 As per my study, US 10 yr heading towards 3.20 and 3M LIBOR is going to increase correspondingly. Oil heading towards 80$/Barrel.
6428 2018-03-31 16:14:12 I live(?) in Oklahoma and this state is BROKE.  Republican governor,republican house & republican senate have given tax breaks to oil/gas and wind power and at same time reduce taxes mostly for upper tax brackets. Same as new tax passed by all republican federal government.
6429 2018-03-31 16:14:05 Getting my oil changed. Open up Twitter on my phone to kill time. First tweet I see says, in part, "ring the bell." Simultaneously as I read the words, a bell rings in the bay as a car gets its oil changed.

6442 2018-03-31 16:12:27 By not identifying any jobs at all in B.C. you’re confirming what I’ve been saying from the very beginning, first to @sjmuir and then to you... there are no jobs for B.C. in B.C. with twinning the pipeline to Asia for the purpose of shipping oil through B.C.! #bcpoli #cdnpoli
6443 2018-03-31 16:12:26 The oil candle and fabric tablecloth....bad combo.
6444 2018-03-31 16:12:16 Things I didn’t plan on doing today: small engine repair. Lawm mower won’t start after checking oil, air filter, and spark plug. It was run dry before winter storage. Guess it’s starter fluid up next, but that’s for another day. Time for beer and bulb planting.
6445 2018-03-31 16:11:57 Phoney witch.. You and your GOP friends continue to sell off historic and sacred Indian lands and national parks to feed big oil profiteers. Then you continue to cater to these hogs and others with $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. SHAME on you!
6446 2018-03-31 16:11:54 ...So we shouldn’t keep burning oil or coal and expect that climate change will be less of a problem. 

Einstein didn’t comment on climate change. But his contemporaries do and they agree that it’s a real problem, that it’s caused by us and that it can be solved
6447 2018-03-31 16:11:54 Who would have guessed that a breakfast of coffee, fish oil capsules, and sour gumnt worms would make me intensely nauseated for 2 hours
6448 2018-03-31 16:11:47 So Scott Pruitt is going to roll back mileage standards set by Obama for cars & SUV’s. Forgetting climate change, why don’t they want better fuel efficiency? It saves on gas, (a limited resource) & it saves $ for consumers. Both good results. So it’s all to help oil companies?

6465 2018-03-31 16:09:50 I've seen oil and gas booms at least 5 times in my 61 year lifetime.

How 'bout working on some Democratic Socialism like they got in Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany.  I'd rather have long term stability than your Fox-News-version of the world.
6466 2018-03-31 16:09:37 Keep pushing this,  Solar, wind, hydro, intelligence grid storage together with energy efficiency investments can AND SHOULD eliminate the need for another massive white elephant whether powered by dirty coal, oil or nukes....

6468 2018-03-31 16:08:49 I've heard of people using CBD oil but I don't know if that works on your kind of pain. Or if it is legal in NY.  Indiana stepped on a rake over that and ended up passing a law specifically legalizing it, instead of a general one for hemp products that lack THC.

6481 2018-03-31 16:06:44 The future does not lie in oil and gas-it cannot if we wish to preserve our environment-it is not sustainable. True & sustainable happiness would be better achieved with jobs based in sustainable, non polluting resources

6511 2018-03-31 16:02:23 So no jobs for B.C. outside the oil patch! That’s what you are saying. No economic benefit for B.C. just more people working in the Alberta Oil Patch so we can increase production and ship this oil through B.C. and B.C. waters. That’s not what @sjmuir was promoting! #bcpoli
6512 2018-03-31 16:02:15 And my response is always "So?"  American Cheese, Velveta etc... all are great when used correctly.  And when melted, they don't turn into an oil slick.

6529 2018-03-31 16:00:26 Washing your car at home allows grease, oil, metals and chemicals to flow into storm drains causing environmental pollution. See us instead!
6530 2018-03-31 16:00:08 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
6531 2018-03-31 16:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

6537 2018-03-31 15:59:24 Due to control on black money the hoarders are not able to buy, stock and sell the commidities at higher rate . That's the reason price of rice , wheat , oil , all types of dal have been at same price
6538 2018-03-31 15:59:21 This from a man who has a plaque on his tax payer funded office wall commemorating IRA terrorists. 
It’s worth noting that Semtex was manufactured in Czechoslovakia & was the IRAs weapon of choice. Jeremy Corbyn was the one person in regular contact with both!
6539 2018-03-31 15:59:18 I found a similar map for oil to be very cool especially in terms of the flow of goods. I didn't realize we were so technologically advanced and actually had such a long spanning system in place connecting our borders.

6567 2018-03-31 15:55:56 That's just propaganda, and you know it. Monopolies are un-American and have traditionally been addressed by American presidents, like Roosevelt with Standard Oil and Reagan with AT&T. If your concern really is jobs, how many businesses has Amazon destroyed?

6592 2018-03-31 15:52:31 I’m waiting to get picked up from an oil change place and the TV just played a long commercial full of patriotic imagery voiced over with a quote by...Calvin Coolidge?

6594 2018-03-31 15:52:22 Gas & Oil are finite non renewable resources it would make sense that the price is climbing

6596 2018-03-31 15:52:18 A health resource economy will help us be global leaders in renewables  @BobHeaslip , and bye bye oil?  Not in your lifetime. @Brady11Canuck @PipelineAction
6597 2018-03-31 15:52:15 I just put hella oil in here and it's still going down in numbers WTF 
6598 2018-03-31 15:51:33 What we could do is aggressively shut down the oil and gas industry in Canada and move and innovate just as aggressively to renewables and the least harmful options to show the rest of the world how it's done and create an export market for our related products and services.
6599 2018-03-31 15:51:26 Jugs of what? Olive oil, vinegar?

6603 2018-03-31 15:51:03 Reece and I were walking by a room where two of our cats were expressing their dislike for one another. Reece said "Grab the oil and call a priest.. We have demons!" #reecequotes
6604 2018-03-31 15:51:03 A hot oil scalp massage sounds so good right now. 
6605 2018-03-31 15:51:03 Demand for digital and technology experts is growing in oil, gas and energy. Check out Petroplan's recruitment expertise to find tech industry talent #oilandgasrecruitment
6606 2018-03-31 15:51:00 No, I do not. I live down at English Bay where these oil tankers you are promoting will be sailing past, if we allow it. I have lived here many, many years regardless of where I was born. You’re still trying to make this personal @burkesback ! Why? #bcpoli #cdnpoli
6607 2018-03-31 15:50:59 but then a Guy went to the UN because he invented a car that can run on water, not gasoline or oil, so they had him shot and his designs destroyed

6612 2018-03-31 15:50:31 And it was Russia that saw the km long oil tanker queues at the Turkish border and started bombing them. Not the US  -70 % of sorties came back with bombs on the racks
6613 2018-03-31 15:50:22 The lower the emission standards, the more the oil that Koch brothers can sell to owners of gas guzzlers  

For Trump, regulations cuts are quick & easy rewards to donors.  

The donor money  then flows to his 2020 re-election campaign/
and to his legal defense fund.

6615 2018-03-31 15:50:09 Brazil’s state-controlled oil firm Petrobras hedged 128 million barrels of its expected 2018 production (15% of production) with an average price of $65 per barrel thus protecting part of its operating cash flow generation

6618 2018-03-31 15:49:39 @Pennzoil I just applied for my oil rebate, thank you!!!
6619 2018-03-31 15:49:39 Man there is some real disconnect between what people think is 'cut and dry' and what is real life. Keep blocking pipelines so we have to buy dirty oil from overseas. Like what do you think will happen?  
That's it for my rant today lol.
6620 2018-03-31 15:49:35 It’s Syria’s oil - what on earth does our natural resources have to do with Iran- who have huge amounts of gas and oil reserves themselves anyway ... disgusting excuse to justify continued illegal occupation
6621 2018-03-31 15:49:32 lacked a little more oil

6625 2018-03-31 15:49:13 Wtf its not even moving after all this oil I put in here
6626 2018-03-31 15:48:58 It's just burning oil. (Or burning rich as country folks say).
6627 2018-03-31 15:48:39 It's probably more challenging to be an Uber driver than to park the Space Shuttle.  Towing the shuttle happened slowly, with a half-dozen vehicles of traffic going the same direction at the same speed, absolutely zero road hazards…
6628 2018-03-31 15:48:23 $40 million has been spent by the Oil & Gas industry in #Oklahoma to counter real science in the classroom. Many teachers, themselves uneducated about climate science, have taught this  industry propaganda. Another sad statistic.  #climatechange #oklaed @tulsavoice @tulsaworld
6629 2018-03-31 15:48:22 俺はわりと「誰しも馬鹿にされると恥ずかしいことがあるわけで、誰しもが同じ条件ということはそれは大して恥じる必要もないわけなので、お互いに好きなだけ馬鹿にし合っていこう」というスタンスなのだけど、そういうスタンスではない人が多いらしく、結果的に俺だけが人を馬鹿にしまくる構図ができる

6635 2018-03-31 15:47:34 Can you imagine Charlie welding?

Guy probably can't change his own oil. Wouldn't want to get his khakis and boat shoes dirty.
6636 2018-03-31 15:47:26 Patiently waiting for @ShadeyLadyLLC to bring out a “body lava” , until then I’ll continue to mix my shadeblocker and some coconut oil for the ultimate body glow lol

6638 2018-03-31 15:47:13 Easter weekend always makes me realize how low Jews set the bar for miracles

Christians: Jesus literally just rose from the dead, it's a miracle!!

Jews: bro, looks like we got some extra strong oil, sick
6639 2018-03-31 15:47:10 Russian tankers allowed to take our oil

6643 2018-03-31 15:46:57 Show me where you arrive at your 29 000 direct jobs, for the activity of shipping oil to Asia by oil tanker. Where are these jobs and what would they be specifically doing? Here in B.C.? #bcpoli #cdnpoli #WaterIsLife
6644 2018-03-31 15:46:44 We need the equivalent of the Parkland students movement for the fossil fuel industry.  Will someone step up and be the @shannonrwatts of ‘humans demand’ against big oil?  @LeoDiCaprio @elonmusk @MarkRuffalo

6653 2018-03-31 15:45:16 Very nice @NYTSports, he is really becoming a fan favorite here in Oil Country.

6743 2018-04-01 23:57:42 Many proven benefits resulting from cannabis oil and not the actual THC component.
6744 2018-04-01 23:57:37 Why am I getting promoted tweets by climate-change denying lobby groups backed by oil companies? Im not the one, my dudes
6745 2018-04-01 23:57:04 2. for right now because your hair is in crisis, here is what you use: hair masks. apply to the scalp and the roots. i recommend mashed avocado+banana blended with olive oil. coconut oil is a sealant not a moisture so don’t use it.
6746 2018-04-01 23:57:04 おはよー！
6747 2018-04-01 23:56:43 I’ve recently started using E-balm which is essential oils + emu oil (anti inflammatory) it helps a bit. I guess my question is more medically what can I do. Who to see about it.

6750 2018-04-01 23:56:14 The only chance of forcing the media to cover news instead of the pResidents ego stroke, is to make the TV/internet audience disinterested in the North Korea type parade. If media would cover all the aid Russia is giving NK, including oil & weapons, going 1/2

6755 2018-04-01 23:54:54 I added random amounts of salt, butter, oil, water and vanilla extract.  I'll probably never be able to do it again lol.
6756 2018-04-01 23:54:49 I have vacuum lungs when it comes to flower but as soon as someone puts oil in my face I know I’m about to suffocate
6757 2018-04-01 23:54:45 Lmao I survived. Next time I'll actually try some Texas BBQ or something. Lol now if you'll excuse me I gotta go wash my face again because it's already summer here in Cali and I look like a bottle of 100% pure olive oil.

6761 2018-04-01 23:54:08 The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) suddenly remembers the pricing formula when international oil prices go up. When the prices plummet as they did during the last couple of years it conveniently forgets the much-talked-about pricing mechanism #lka
6762 2018-04-01 23:53:54 Niece has a cut finger. Her grandma: “put lavender oil on it!” Me: “Do NOT. Lavender is a known skin irritant and should not be put on wounds or skin irritations.” I got her a band-aid.
6763 2018-04-01 23:53:49 Mary sounds so tired. I need an oil change so bad.
6764 2018-04-01 23:53:23 As the mother of a daughter, head lice were once the bane of my life. Most successful treatment: tea tree oil in conditioner, coat hair, comb and comb again. Repeat every four days for about four years. Maldison preparations do not perform better as a treatment.

6766 2018-04-01 23:53:10 It ain’t nothing to put some mica pigment and fragrance oil into a light body oil. Make my own lava shidd.
6767 2018-04-01 23:53:05 Ooo, I like using tea tree oil on my face but I read online about peppermint and just one use really helped me
6768 2018-04-01 23:52:24 Yes, I learned today my mother's bath aide may be stealing the expensive bottles of essential oil I bought her that she needs to keep her lungs open.

I was so pissed, I knew I wasn't going to be able to work today unless I acted on buying the oil again. Ended up ordering online.
6769 2018-04-01 23:52:24 Only during the oil shocks, and even then it wasn't as bad as now. We never recovered from the dot-com or 2008 recessions.

6774 2018-04-01 23:51:27 It's time to switch to renewable energy! Take back power from the corrupt oil companies. How man can choose power and money over the state of the earth baffles me. If we stop using fossil fuels now, the planet May still be able to repair itself. #Greenpeace #climatechange

6785 2018-04-01 23:49:36 Try oil cleansing tbh. It might be too drying to use all three. & your skin will need some nutrients given back to it

6796 2018-04-01 23:48:01 Can't do that we'd put the oil industry out of business. The military-industrial complex. Recreational marijuana? Sure. Industrial hemp? Out of the question.
6797 2018-04-01 23:47:57 Lavender essential oil as a coping mechanism
6798 2018-04-01 23:47:54 This week, oil traders are likely to remain influenced by political news headlines in the absence of any oil market reports from the likes of OPEC or the IEA. Eyes remain focused on Iran and Saudi Arabia specifically, but developments in North Korea could also play a role.
6799 2018-04-01 23:47:36 The honest truth is that if the oil sands were in Quebec or Ontario they would be doing the same thing we are. No country or province with our oil reserves would leave the product in the ground. If you think otherwise you are being naive

6830 2018-04-01 23:42:32 That's not fair. I think it is the position. Look at @Glen4Climate from the @OntLiberal . Seems they both share batshit crazy. Both have that expression that after one bad day they will blow up an oil refinery.

6832 2018-04-01 23:41:58 I deleted mine a couple of days ago. I'd like to minimize my exposure to as much of this stuff as I can. I know that, short of living in a cabin in the mountains, it's impossible to avoid altogether, but I want to shrink my public footprint as much as possible.
6833 2018-04-01 23:41:16 That would be cuticle oil!
6834 2018-04-01 23:41:00 Big Pharma, big agriculture, AIPAC, big oil, SEIU, or literally any number of other lobbying groups do this, and they do it with volumes of cash several orders of magnitude larger.

6844 2018-04-01 23:39:34 Depends what's in it and if you're reheating it. If it has sauce then you can reheat in microwave on low for 1 min at a time until cooked through, if no sauce then drizzle with a bit of Olive/veg oil and heat the same. Been 3days so won't last any longer, needs eating or throwing
6845 2018-04-01 23:39:19 Coconut oil?
6846 2018-04-01 23:39:19 For all the eviromentalists who are opposed To Trump and Pruitt and fracking. Until Europe is independent of Russian oil and gas, especially gas the U.S. and Europe cannot stand up to Putin and Russia in any meaningful way ( think energy crisis of 70s). Until we solve Russia....

Not lost on me that UK expats (of which there are many in oil country) could take it the wrong way if they only caught a glance.

6852 2018-04-01 23:38:41 Did not occur to me that using coconut oil to make mayonnaise could be problematic. It solidifies under 75 degrees or so. I'm an idiot. I'll have to heat up my egg

6853 2018-04-01 23:38:09 Dont be deceived king,thats the excuse they always bring up
6854 2018-04-01 23:37:57 Thanks for the suggestion! I use tea tree oil on my feet and it usually helps, I've never tried peppermint oil for my feet though. This weather is just killing my joints and I spent too much time on my feet this weekend 
6855 2018-04-01 23:37:40 Let the righteous thoughtfully strike correct me
It is a kindness done to encourage my spiritual maturity
It is the choicest anointing oil on the head

For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.

The question is can someone extract oil for multiple Individual License holders and if so, are there legal req's?

6946 2018-04-01 23:19:32 Oh, do you prefer the status quo? Piping discounted oil to Minnesota for extra jingle in the pockets of the Koch brothers? Shipping oil by rail? It's less efficient, more dangerous than pipeline, and grain producers lost out on 13K rail cars since August.

7030 2018-04-01 23:06:23 Climate Change is REAL!! Ask the majority of unbiased (not purchased by Big Oil and Gas) scientists and they all agree. Big Oil and Gas just care about money. #VoteBigOilandGasOutofPolitics #VoteBlue #GOPDon’tCareAboutTheEnvironment
7031 2018-04-01 23:06:11 now to get all the smoke from burning the oil, out of the apartment ;________________;
7032 2018-04-01 23:05:54 We need more patience. The better strategy may be investing in shale oil both in Canada and the US. While we are waiting natural gas recovering, we can enjoy the benefit from higher oil price.

7048 2018-04-01 23:02:13 Federal Reserve should reduce interest rates in order to allow the economy to expand and grow!!!With OIL PRICES creeping higher the rate hike would be an added tax on consumers and investors, defeating the tax cut plan...
7049 2018-04-01 23:02:09 Btc is only a panacea for the problem of idiots needing to be separated from their money. This isn't really revolutionary, though. There's been plenty of snake oil bottled before, and just as many gullible rubes ready to be swindled.
7050 2018-04-01 23:02:08 Cut off Russia's overseas funds, fire their spy army back at them with air cannons, withdraw all business. Which Europe can't, because they're dependent on Russia's gas and oil.
All the more reason for Europe to convert to solar and wind completely.

7079 2018-04-01 22:57:32 It is really the snake oil salesman carpetbagging phenomenon of our age, yet no one seems to care or believe the minority report (educated people like you, who actually do research and report on your findings; the public wipes its ass on your intelligence at their own risk!!)

7081 2018-04-01 22:56:34 Our astronauts can do great work servicing the ISS, but it's still kind of at the level of "change the oil" or "attach this to that", not "weld all this stuff together like a Mad Max truck".

7085 2018-04-01 22:55:50 But to be fair it’s not everyone who knows about political situations across the world. You must have an interest in current affairs to have a grasp of the ever changing geopolitics of the Middle East. That area is very complex and also often influenced by oil trade

7103 2018-04-01 22:51:25 And the £ is (still) down against $. We get fewer $ for our £ and everything we pay for in $ costs us more, therefore our imports cost more, oil costs us more and our transport costs go up. All brexit fallout.
Sorry, but there’s no way it works out well for #outists
7104 2018-04-01 22:51:19 Again, you're aware those areas were controlled by ISIS, right? We don't even need oil, we have tons of our own and nowhere to export it to.

We moved into the region north of Deir Ez Zour to liberate the people there.
7105 2018-04-01 22:50:48 The country currently pumps about 45,000 barrels of oil a day from its Bahrain Field, and it shares income from a deposit with Saudi Arabia that produces about 300,000 barrels a day, according to figures from the U.S

7128 2018-04-01 22:45:12 The recipe, instructions and flavour was bang on! Maybe briquettes instead of lump as they were done in 30 mins (probably less). Smaller chunk of wood as this was a little overpowering. They also needed a bit more oil as you mentioned. What did you use to spray them with?
7129 2018-04-01 22:45:07 Anyone use cannabis oil/cannabidiol for any medical reasons? Hearing good things, what's the opinions?
7130 2018-04-01 22:44:32 they have to be firm but not too cold. And dont over heat your chocolate. Thin down with a bit of oil if need be for it to go on smoother. Most people dont have cocoa butter nibs or paramount crystals(wax really) to thin down lol.

7147 2018-04-01 22:41:31 What you are trying to say is we a country can thrive under economic sanctions. Venezuela has oil, so does Iraq and Iran. And in the modern economy that is more valuable than gold, diamonds or coal. But when sanctions came calling they could not thrive or are not thriving.

7159 2018-04-01 22:39:15 Experimenting a bit, hope this works! I took my mandolin on the smallest setting and sliced two sweet potatoes, (tossed them in melted ghee, pink salt and a touch of walnut oil) 

so I’m baking those in the oven and 

now I will make some guacamole

7163 2018-04-01 22:38:08 Weird, missed your retort.  I understand you desire the crap oil to be sold.  But the pipeline isn’t going through “northern” BC and it’s impacting habitats, watersheds and property through Central BC. Your lack of logic stems from not understanding the impacts. It’s okay.

7165 2018-04-01 22:37:36 It’s also oil free !
7166 2018-04-01 22:37:33 it was. you just take all the ingredients above and fry in some olive oil and you're done.

Stir ingredients together with spoon til only slightly lumpy
Pour in pan

Difficult for u but try before u again tweet on petrol prices.
Hope u Googled the term 'under recoveries' of oil companies and how much they were burdened by prev govt. Appreciate the efforts of BJP to make them sustainable.
7177 2018-04-01 22:35:47 Tyler Olson has allowed a regular-season major-league run for the first time since April 15, 2016. Indians' bullpen is leaking oil.
7178 2018-04-01 22:35:34 Why was there no oil in Helm's Deep?

7180 2018-04-01 22:35:23 If you want oil prices to go back to what it was under Jonathan, like. If you want it to remain this way, comment reason. Games you play!!!!!
7181 2018-04-01 22:35:20 Too much oil Ya heard starting to look like Easter basket grass
7182 2018-04-01 22:35:12 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
7183 2018-04-01 22:34:59 Like I said: if all of the 1 percenters were dragged into the street and hanged.poverty would not be. The rich destabilize to keep you poor. Look at Mexico's economy. Oil rich and poor at the same time.They blame Americans,but it's the 1 percent that control their government.
7184 2018-04-01 22:34:57 Well it's not like something bad happened in that one, while I watched from bw3 minot taming oil country
7185 2018-04-01 22:34:54 If you post a recipe to your website for grilled Greek chicken and the entire ingredient list is chicken breast, olive oil, and Greek seasoning, is that really a recipe?
7186 2018-04-01 22:34:46 An olive oil lamp light is barely a shadow in front a lamp burning ghee.
7187 2018-04-01 22:34:42 I'm very interested why car manufacturers would do this... Seems more like big oil and gas move.
7188 2018-04-01 22:34:38 Yeah, I hate it when you try to lubricate a rusty door-hinge and the oil just keeps talking at you.
7189 2018-04-01 22:34:23 I come from where the boom-and-bust oil fields fight the water-deficient cattle ranches. Everyone’s great-grandparents grew up together. I could never reconcile the social viewpoints, but those are lives nonetheless.
7190 2018-04-01 22:34:13 would appear that is well under way.  i am unversed but it looks like that was brokered by trump and i get the impression trump wants to leave them in charge of policing the ME.  with oil/gas concessions of course.
7191 2018-04-01 22:33:59 Update. I dropped the empty bottle from the EVOO and it fell on the floor and broke. I just spent 20 minutes cleaning glass shards and olive oil from every inch of my kitchen. I give up on "cooking"
7192 2018-04-01 22:33:34 Only if the lights go of when he turns off the oil supply

7195 2018-04-01 22:33:14 So those capable of weaponising uranium don't need to steal it from nuclear energy sites! Second, why are we not protesting against oil, water both of which kill more people in war. Or planes, vehicles all used for weapons including civilian versions. Senseless argument really
7196 2018-04-01 22:33:00 I just saw a fire hydrant and an oil painting fight kids. AMA.
7197 2018-04-01 22:32:49 Okay, the addition of the "snake mushrooms" to my zoodle ramen was inspired. Henceforth, I am adding sauted mushrooms to everything. Ice cream, shampoo, motor oil. I don't care. Mushrooms RULE.

7202 2018-04-01 22:31:14 The relentless marketing of "renewables" and its co-joined twin gas has saturated media globally, to the point where nobody even questions it.

Big oil has won. We wont decarbonise electricity, but we'll have lots of eye-candy for solace.
7203 2018-04-01 22:30:55 Like a career in the oil and gas field? That has left us broke and him missing out on our life.

7245 2018-04-01 22:21:57 I guess you are experienced in the oil and gas business. Have you even thought of the other options there are besides slamming a massive tax on that industry. Again, do your own research and stop relying on what you are hearing.

7248 2018-04-01 22:21:40 Can do, but we had a better plan. financial services is our thing. The Chinese just launched a gold backed trade note for countries to bypass the petrodollar to buy & sell oil in Yuan. China cannot process such complex trades, so they gave CITY of London the contract ;)

7253 2018-04-01 22:19:59 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

Now she's got a chance at that pigeon and enough energy to get to the Forest of Dean and a chance at a wild boar. Certain groups appear to be above the law. lol
7257 2018-04-01 22:19:19 Start planting more trees.

7258 2018-04-01 22:19:19 Reason for high fuel costs?

7266 2018-04-01 22:17:18 But Chechnya is not. And it doesn't have any powerful allies that could threaten war with Russia. If the countries surrounding Israel were poor, friendless & without oil this would be a fair comparison.
7267 2018-04-01 22:17:03 They are putting in the global market a strategy they used at Venezuela perse they are selling in the market proximity’s 8 millions of barrels making a strategy alliance with the opep members. They price of the oil will rise.
7268 2018-04-01 22:17:01 My mate has an old diesel cavalier, from the days when it was all mechanical pumps. he uses old vegetable oil from the chip shop mixed 50/50 with diesel. It works great but smells like a kitchen

7277 2018-04-01 22:14:56 The EPA is a joke bc oil and gas and fracking lobbyists are running it now.
It is there to protect all Americans from pollutants and chemicals in our air and water.
Utah as a state will not protect its citizens - only the federal govt can protect all Americans.

7282 2018-04-01 22:13:12 Yes try it! And the results are fast. Be careful with lemon oil tho, make sure you mix it with something like shea butter or another carrier oil. And don’t wear it while out in the sun it can cause damage to your skin.
7283 2018-04-01 22:13:03 Dubai (AFP) - Bahrain on Sunday announced it has discovered the largest oil and gas field in the history of the small kingdom, which unlike its Gulf neighbours is not energy-rich.

7294 2018-04-01 22:10:01 Yes - you only need a drop or two. A couple of drops of vegetable oil also works. Removes any of the dullness, stains or smudges that you get left on the hob after cleaning with ordinary kitchen cleaner.
7295 2018-04-01 22:09:50 No time
7296 2018-04-01 22:09:48 Problem with EV shop is do not expect much of a repair, have very few parts compared to gas ones, no oil change. Bicycle shop is much closer to EV business. May be EV rentals could be excellent idea or at least the battery rental. Swap battery under 10s & drive on.
7297 2018-04-01 22:09:25 I’ve been bouncing from different primers. My favorite right now is the tatcha silk canvas. It’s good for oil control.

7305 2018-04-01 22:08:08 you're right, that's actually a picture of kirby going to iraq for oil
7306 2018-04-01 22:07:17 It would be great to invest those technologies but you can’t just ban something without an alternative. It’s like banning all oil/gas for cars into 100% electric in just a week or month, that would cause chaos around the world/country
7307 2018-04-01 22:07:11 Art, many thanks for your graph, it definitely clears the picture for us regarding recent significant Production growth of gas in USA. More pipelines need be built to get these gas out off the basins, otherwise it will only stored or flared. In summery,oil up gas up, vice verse.
7308 2018-04-01 22:06:59 Got my brakes fixed, my oil changed, and washed and vacuumed my car out. Happy Easter

7312 2018-04-01 22:06:43 Shah of Iran. He made his country a secular one (by force though), he let the Brits and the US keep getting oil cheaply, and he attempted to westernize his country.

Substantially lower body counts than mao, Hitler, or Stalin.

7316 2018-04-01 22:06:10 You can avoid staining by applying she butter, coconut oil, or thick conditioner around your hairline and over your ears, and if you get stained then you can use toothpaste or baking soda paste to remove the stain!

7317 2018-04-01 22:06:06 Still, there is demand
We can't survive without oil
Oil=water (i.em importance)
7318 2018-04-01 22:05:57 I may be reading this incorrectly but I would like to believe the value of his land may have gone down significantly.  No one wants beach front properties with view of oil rigs. With the potential for spills and leaks.

7321 2018-04-01 22:05:11 Oh nooooo not the “oil” glands that produce no oils at all but pretty much a saline solution. You should focus your germaphobia on cooks who dont wear face masks and scream over the stove all day. You dumbasses love to get fake mad at everything but the right thing.

(Add some craisins or raisins and peanuts or cashews to the rice pot at the very end to soften a bit for some extra yum
7326 2018-04-01 22:04:10 “Gee christine, why don’t you ever cook dinner?” people ask me. 
Me- sits down to dinner I just cooked with a swollen lip due to a hot oil incident
7327 2018-04-01 22:04:07 It's almost like somebody grabbed the entire US coastline for off shore oil drilling?
7328 2018-04-01 22:04:04 I definitely believe Schiff is up to his neck.  His sister is married to Soros’ son.  He owns shares in Russian connected Hedge Fund in oil & gas.  Mueller the same only in 3 Russian connected Hedge Funds.  What a scam these guys are running.
7329 2018-04-01 22:03:58 O&G is lagging behind mining companies... while the latter are already mining bitcoins to diversify their portfolios, oil companies insist in drilling fossil instead of digital fuels.

7345 2018-04-01 22:01:18 Thought more on $AMZN’s anti-trust concerns. Here’s a (short) history of U.S. monopolies being broken:

1. Standard Oil owned oil. 
2. U.S. Steel owned steel.
3. American Tobacco owned it. 
4. AT&T owned communications.

Amazon owns just 4% of retail. And 43% of eCommerce.
7346 2018-04-01 22:01:12 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH my friend just described himself as an oil painting that got rained on
7347 2018-04-01 22:01:05 Trump is a snake oil salesman always has been and always will be . Anybody who brags as much as he does has a inferiority complex. Talk, talk, talk that’s all he does . A true leader thinks before he talks . Bragging and boasting always leads to ones demise
7348 2018-04-01 22:01:02 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. If you aren't vocal about an issue then people won't pay attention.
7349 2018-04-01 22:00:39 Did the French use whale oil as a preventative for trench-foot (le trench-foot?) as well?

7361 2018-04-01 21:59:21 That’s why all the wars, if America doesn’t force the world to buy and sell oil in petro dollars their economy will collapse as will ours.
7362 2018-04-01 21:58:51 Don’t forget to drink your water and use your coconut oil 
7363 2018-04-01 21:58:44 Another semi-literate tweet from this twerp. Did the school he went to even teach punctuation?
7364 2018-04-01 21:58:42 You know things like: splitting the sea, turning water to wine and successfully diversifying a heavily oil reliant economy.
7365 2018-04-01 21:58:38 Coming back to psuedo scientific bullshit.
Seeing someone tout that cannabis oil can cure cancer? considering how many friends and relatives Ive lost, and nearly lost my dad to cancer?

7376 2018-04-01 21:56:51 I don't blame him for not dignifying that with a response. And again, if you think that refusing money (influence) from oil companies, military industries, and wall st. is outweighed by red-scare McCarthyism, then that's too bad.

7388 2018-04-01 21:55:59 Really the only problematic thing I saw was the cook with coconut oil any chance you get. CO has 6x the amount of saturated fat than olive oil and that can get tricky FAST lol

7391 2018-04-01 21:55:33 No, Trump just meant his oil and coal buddies, and any Russians contributing to his campaign.
7392 2018-04-01 21:55:23 There's still a very tiny piece of me that thinks Canadians might stop their country from shedding blood for oil.
7393 2018-04-01 21:55:20 you do have to buy PB before you are out, it can take a week for the oil to migrate
7394 2018-04-01 21:55:18 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy above your fellows.
Psalm 45:7
7395 2018-04-01 21:55:05 Jojoba oil is so much better! The composition is almost identical to your skins natural oil so it helps rebalance oil production while being non-comedogenic. Honestly it's a miracle  you could also add a little tea tree to it if you wanted
7396 2018-04-01 21:55:00 ISX needs to branch out and form BSX (Basra), also gov should allow public investment in cash strapped public companies, will help generate domestic & foreign capital needs. Basra can slowly grow to a financial hub as oil, petrochemicals & basic industries expand. /end
7397 2018-04-01 21:55:00 Expect correction to sensex as 4th qtr results are announced. Pre poll analysis of who will win elections in Karnataka will drive the mkt. If crude prices  move up and oil companies are not allowed to raise the prices. Then it would cause decline in stock prices for BPCL/HPCL/OIL
7398 2018-04-01 21:54:55 A city of 4 million people shut down that controls the oil/gas energy for most of the country required special attention to get the economy back up as quickly as possiable or millions and millions would be impacted !
7399 2018-04-01 21:54:49 i'm the kind of guy who likes to splurge on an essential oil diffuser
7400 2018-04-01 21:54:37 I've been thinking about the mistake of construing social media & smartphones as material machines or even as cognitive/cultural experiences. They are immaterial machines made to extract & burn our attention like oil. They remake our minds/friendships/time into pulleys & levers.
7401 2018-04-01 21:54:35 It's mostly small cut up pieces of fruit or vegetables with a smallish amount of rice tossed in and dressed with oil and vinegar. It's very tasty.
7402 2018-04-01 21:54:29 @TheRickWilson I made a paste of garlic, rosemary, anchovies, and olive oil (supposed to use butter, but that's not kosher), then squeezed lemon halves on top of the whole thing. Worked out pretty nicely.
7403 2018-04-01 21:54:26 Fun fact: I really do paint using eggs. Egg tempera was a paint used frequently before oil paint was invented. It has to be done on a hard surface rather than canvas (such as a wood panel) because the paint isn't flexible.

7405 2018-04-01 21:54:13 What about the kugel and the gefilte fish? I always wonder why Moses wondered in the desert for 49 years and didn’t settle in some place with lotsa oil. Also wondered what did the we eat during those 40 years. Matzah?
7406 2018-04-01 21:54:12 I haven't enjoyed using mine. The pump is a bit of a bitch to refill. It had oil in the pump tube and it made the first tank full taste like shit and had to clean it out best I could.

7415 2018-04-01 21:51:47 Trump wasn't responsible for the US amping up our domestic oil production....Also potential Russian collusion has not been debunked as there is still an active investigation into members of the Trump campaign as well as possibly the administration and Trump himself.

7419 2018-04-01 21:51:14 You can be a business owner In a socialist system, the free makers only advantages the well off and privellaged few so the idea that it is unjust is not an opinion but rather a fact, e.g. the free makert destroyed the Middle East for oil and gas purposes
7420 2018-04-01 21:50:48 5% of oil is energy 95% is petrochemicals which means our life Gaze around u 90% made of petrochemicals

7423 2018-04-01 21:49:58 He basically says, “assume you always pay twice as much as the avg cost of electricity, you never charge at a free station, you have to replace a battery.” He then ignores costs of engine, transmission, spark plugs, oil changes, etc that don’t need to be maintained on an EV.

7457 2018-04-01 21:43:03 Dumbest thing I ever read. The entire run up in Venezuela was due to the run on oil prices in an economy overly dependant on oil. The fall was due to oil prices as well. "Banana Republics" are overly dependant on one item. Canada is the opposite.

7484 2018-04-01 21:38:53 Haha! The people I bought it from at the markets recommended sunflower or grapeseed oil. O6 content has me a little iffy however.

7508 2018-04-01 21:35:07 Demand will decline as EVs arrive but it will plateau afterwards, so long as the world economy needs petrochemicals and plastics. There are non-petroleum substitutes for those needs, so the very long term outlook for oil should be bearish.

This was after several failed attempts in the 60s where ANC voted for the move, but statewide support for JNU was >50%
7596 2018-04-01 21:17:18 This weekend, try oil pulling while wearing a citrine bracelet.
7597 2018-04-01 21:16:38 There's nothing like help, dama it's family and friends that usually crashes one's business.
7598 2018-04-01 21:16:28 Note Russky plutocrats, oligarchs are ALSO into invading the Arctic. Just like the Trump-Pruitt crowd: Drill for oil on North Shore of Alaska. Alaska = Siberia.
Solution: U.N. must hold treaty conference to get 199 nations to declare Arctic & Antarctic are OFF LIMITS to risks.

7600 2018-04-01 21:15:55 Buhari inherited government when crude oil price the major revenue  source dropped from over $100 per barrel to Less than $40 per barrel, no money In CBN and foreign reserve as looted by former Govt. Baba Fell sick but keep working.
7601 2018-04-01 21:15:33 You are literally a snake oil salesman.
7602 2018-04-01 21:15:32 I'm trying to cook lunch and there's no olive oil....how is there no olive oil in an Arab household? Wot in tarnation
7603 2018-04-01 21:15:28 I checked my overspill pantry cupboard earlier looking for the spare olive oil + I've apparently got all the tinned tomatoes, so I'll come round shall I?
7604 2018-04-01 21:15:19 Expecting pump update via twitter pic, and Dino-2 result around 9 April... busy month ahead. New tax year, YA all will be gone in April. this share set to fly in April
7605 2018-04-01 21:15:01 Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!

7606 2018-04-01 21:14:52 Amazing! I had zero luck with the candles. Olive oil and slooshing (which as a regular sufferer I do myself these days)…

7608 2018-04-01 21:14:00 Agriculture aside, Nigeria can easily generate double our oil revenue from Tourism; we clearly have supererogatory resources.
7609 2018-04-01 21:14:00 Listen Lara, the word appropriate, and Ronald Kray don’t go together, like water and oil. Don’t take it to heart, you’ve natural beauty there’s no doubt about that one

7611 2018-04-01 21:13:40 I personally deposited every drop of oil. So it is a gift from me, to me.
7612 2018-04-01 21:12:52 He anoints my head with oil. My cup overflows
7613 2018-04-01 21:12:39 This is the GHG budget (18% of Canada'a total national 2030 budget)  that is set aside for AB oilsands only. We don't yet know how @ec_McKenna plans to treat conventional oil and gas producers in BC, AB, or SK, or Newfoundland offshore oil producers.
7614 2018-04-01 21:12:18 Cut his nuts off! Boil him oil! Public hanging! Nothing is good enough for this piece of shit!
7615 2018-04-01 21:12:11 And if Chechnya had powerful oil rich allies this would be a good analogy
7616 2018-04-01 21:11:47 My point is that it could be seen as hypocritical to be criticizing big oil when using their products. Asking them to be better is good and #education about what they are doing is even better.  Ever seen a lithium mine?

7620 2018-04-01 21:11:05 I use high oil Polish (not cream) to soften leather
7621 2018-04-01 21:11:00 Russia aint working that oil is nonsense right now
7622 2018-04-01 21:10:47 Because oil price is going up!
7623 2018-04-01 21:10:43 I have an idea on how to reduce the US's trade imbalance: a carbon tax. It will depress demand for oil (and gas and coal) in the US, but demand will remain similar globally. So we'll export more (we have lots). There might be other added benefits.
7624 2018-04-01 21:10:29 To busy doing oil field shit... hopefully they pay you double for the holiday

7627 2018-04-01 21:10:13 Joining the EEC gave us improved access to our nearest and largest market providing the conditions to grow the economy. The relative stability this provided (along with North Sea oil revenues) allowed Governments to change social & economic policies & over time to benefit.

7633 2018-04-01 21:09:17 The world is still overwhelmingly dependent on oil, and even though many organizations and governments are working on switching to energy sources that are more friendly for the environment, it will be a long time before they are fully implemented.

7641 2018-04-01 21:07:26 I've read about the nuln oil + nuln oil gloss 1:1 mix by the 'Eavy Team, and its really nice. I'll try necron compound or ironbreaker/runefang/stormhost silver.
7642 2018-04-01 21:07:05 In terms of food production this is spot on. But many fearful of overpopulation are also worried about loss of biodiversity and the expanded, unfettered use of coal and oil resourced.
7643 2018-04-01 21:07:00 Squeeze it and use the oil to bathe
7644 2018-04-01 21:06:52 It’s dead easy & so versatile - good hot or cold & with strawberries, raspberries, cherries, chocolate sauce or ice cream. 

Just make sure you use mild, not extra virgin olive oil!

7649 2018-04-01 21:05:39 Teach, farm, science or art aren't the only necessary things. Who's gonna clean the sewage, dig mines, work on oil fields or in steel factories? Without incentive, only fun jobs will be done. Capitalism isn't perfect, but it's the only thing that works.

7658 2018-04-01 21:04:06 That was sarcasm. Bush did that to Iraq. Trump said take the oil.  I don't support starting wars or stealing oil.
7659 2018-04-01 21:04:03 This is so sad. As soon as I saw this I was thinking oh oh: is this guy about the Koch Brothers trying to discredit EV's? Look I'll play dumb & devils advocate, but cmon, oil changes, tune ups, pumps, hoses, belts, need I go on about savings?
7660 2018-04-01 21:03:55 It’s an essential oil, mostly used for infants. It’s popularly called silver bird.
7661 2018-04-01 21:03:54 Mostly mineral oil, which is used in lotions & creams also.

And because it’s got ground almonds in it, it lasts for 4 or 5 days without going stale.

7674 2018-04-01 21:01:33 Yeah you do know that we only get to tax the profit made on oil? After its been extracted from the harshest place on earth with the resultant costs in actually getting the stuff out? Hence trying to say that oil 'was a bonus' was errant nonsense
7675 2018-04-01 21:01:30 One hot oil treatment coming up 
7676 2018-04-01 21:01:30 You've been trained well by your oil patch masters - you've got the "double-bind hostage taking" argument down pat.  Hostage taking is manipulative as hell - see ya.

7679 2018-04-01 21:01:19 I wish we had gas in Canada...

7683 2018-04-01 21:00:28 Sorry to hear it. You need ground cloves or Clove oil.

7685 2018-04-01 21:00:07 April 01, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7686 2018-04-01 20:59:57 like a banana peel on an oil spill
7687 2018-04-01 20:59:35 putting coconut oil on my legs makes me feel like I'm gonna be cooked at low to medium heat as a side dish to a steak
7688 2018-04-01 20:59:34 I'm using aloe Vera gel plus the topicrem lotion then I put coconut oil. It sounds a lot to do but it worth it I swear.
7689 2018-04-01 20:59:26 Meanwhile all Osibanjo plans while he was Ag President to give us modular refinery is now in the waste bin. Buhari's NNPC is spending more money search for oil in the North, WHY?
7690 2018-04-01 20:59:26 Ok, I may have misread the recipe and initially put way more sesame oil and honey into this sauce than I was supposed to...but I was able to get most of the extra out and it tastes REALLY GOOD...
7691 2018-04-01 20:59:23 The only thing that has stopped me from shaving my hair off is black castor oil. My edges have been revived
7692 2018-04-01 20:59:19 It’s dangerous to wear gloves when you’re a fry cook, if that oil gets on your hands while you have gloves on not only are you at risk for 2nd degree burns plus now the gloves are now stuck to your hands and chemicals could do more damage to your skin
7693 2018-04-01 20:59:13 Hw fr come EPP me work NYSC to lag
7694 2018-04-01 20:59:03 Parts of the NEP were not ideal (but note that the Conservatives seem to be asking for NEP-type features these days) but Alberta was in a frothy state from high oil prices. It was a bubble that burst in the same manner as did other oil-producing jurisdictions.
7695 2018-04-01 20:58:52 I mixed olive oil, juice of half a lemon, sea Salt, black pepper and herbs de provence. In the pan is thin slices of lemon, a whole onion sliced and crushed garlic cloves. The sauce forms from the chicken juices LOL
7696 2018-04-01 20:58:28 Blend by themselves.  Put in a glass jar. Add some seasalt and maybe a lil bit of oil of your choosing (that's optional tho). Sit outside in sunlight for a few days to a week. Almonds would make they own oil naturally
7697 2018-04-01 20:58:13 Love my 520 but miss my Mitsubishi Delica than ran off veg oil. Perfect for big families and you can sleep in it.

7714 2018-04-01 20:54:58 We have environmental standards that these oil companies dont have in other jurisdictions making it more expensive to do business here. Would you rather slack on environmental standards and get rid of subsidies to keep competative?
7715 2018-04-01 20:54:07 Sure, believe it when I see it. He's holding an oil "knife" to the throats of Europe.

7720 2018-04-01 20:53:31 Somewhere between 100,000 and 500,000 innocent people were slaughted for Iraqi oil. It is more logical to fear the cult of Christianity.

7724 2018-04-01 20:53:16 45% of oil consumption is for road transportation & considering the growth of electric cars, I think oil demand will peak sometimes in the next 15-20 yrs. Then the oil that is left would have much lower value (if any) so it is wise to produce/sell more oil before the demand peak!
7725 2018-04-01 20:52:35 Which kin foundation ceec rub for face so ? #BBnaija like Palm oil 
7726 2018-04-01 20:52:20 Hi Jessica- Sorry you are having some cooking trouble Do add oil when cooking the sweet potatoes on stovetop.  Try using a lid while cooking and then if you want more browning remove the lid and cook until desired result . They really don’t overcook.
7727 2018-04-01 20:52:15 Magnesium oil rubbed into the affected area.   If you don't have that, ASPERCREME.   If you have a lot of time, take a nice hot bath with epsom salts (something w/an herb added is always nice) and then take one Bayer Back 'n Body and call me in the morning!!!

7731 2018-04-01 20:51:05 But Israel is stealing oil from the Golan Heights along with water. Gas from Gazan water, and Israel steals water from the West Bank.

7733 2018-04-01 20:50:56 Here’s what we’re up against with influence and the most $. Big oil, the NRA (that’s why no sensible reform), and Russia...their economy IS oil. They’ve been secretly lining pockets for years on the inside. That’s why even more need for this investigation. Pandora’s box will open

7735 2018-04-01 20:50:35 Can we see you vs @saharrahuxly wrestling in baby oil tub???
7736 2018-04-01 20:50:31 The tax-breaks were introduced when the price of oil was low, but the Harper Conservatives were pressured to put an end to them given the quite high prices after the recession, not to mention the deficit difficulties the Conservatives had created for themselves.
7737 2018-04-01 20:50:25 Completely agree. I liked the composition that was coming together on the bigger canvas. It takes a long time to develop that level of confidence though.... How is your oil painting on paper going?
7738 2018-04-01 20:49:58 I learned more from reading the replies.
7739 2018-04-01 20:49:45 Lets hope we do what Scandinavia did with their oil cash and not squander it on giving tax cuts this time round.

7744 2018-04-01 20:48:13 I don't think I like Texas. It's polluted because of big oil/chemical. It's racist as HELL, and Ted Cruz lives there. I would pack the fuck-up and leave.

7746 2018-04-01 20:48:07 You leave out the billions given to big oil every year. No not loans but gifts from the Canadian taxpayers.  Funny how Albertans neglect to mention that.

7769 2018-04-01 20:43:19 The bottlenecks and backlogs are the main reasons for the discount. Two years ago the discount between WCS and WTI was around $15 but now the difference is $28 and the main thing that was changed since that time is the oil production amount per day and backlogs.

7797 2018-04-01 20:37:10 They are a great repellent for many insects as well. I plant them throughout my garden. Also existential oil s of Marigold, cedar, peppermint, black pepper, thyme & others can be mixed with water or insecticidal soap & misted on from a sprayer or spray bottle. Test first!
7798 2018-04-01 20:37:05 You are right on it! Yemen is a hot spot for oil!

7800 2018-04-01 20:36:36 Secondly, retail pricing of fuel is determined by the consortium of oil companies and not by the govt of a day.. govt has means to encourage the companies as shareholder but cannot dictate

7823 2018-04-01 20:30:55 I wish they hurry up with this oil change 
7824 2018-04-01 20:30:55 It was - it was impregnated on the cover with Patchouli oil, couldn't stop sniffing the belly button image
7825 2018-04-01 20:30:55 i forgot to scrape the powder off my face so now i can just f e e l the oil on my skin and i am going home to fucking shower this is gross
7826 2018-04-01 20:30:15 That’s unfortunate! Hopefully it goes away soon! A friend I work with sells a natural oil that helps with migraines. I can find you the link if you want? Will do! Turkey dinner!
7827 2018-04-01 20:30:08 Why can’t he go on LTIR?   Works for the leafs.  New GM comes in.  Says do you want to exit gracefully or just be sent home a la Souray?.  Him getting ice time is enough to burn all other Oiler fwds and is not good for team cohesion
7828 2018-04-01 20:30:05 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...

7832 2018-04-01 20:29:20 No one cares. Maybe not someone who has only a few years left to live, but I certainly do care.  Not monitizing oil/gas wouldn't impoverish us. Many countries are well off and don't export Oil/gas. Netherlands Denmark.  Not exactly poor places

7839 2018-04-01 20:27:18 10? 20? 30? 50 years?    How long until investments in oil companies is like investments in Buggy Whips?   

Between renewables and progress on electric vehicles, there has to be a twilight?
7840 2018-04-01 20:26:58 Plenty of teams have 6M dollar men on the third line.  Problem is you have to find some young value for the top 2 lines.  Other problem is you need 3 lines that can produce in the league now. So 2nd or 3rd doesn’t matter. He’s not a legitimate option
7841 2018-04-01 20:26:43 That said, depends what you are after. If It's being a playoff team, a bounce back year from Talbot & 97 can do that on their own. If It's to be a contender, no chance of it happening.

7847 2018-04-01 20:25:21 It's surprising how little oil companies have had to say publicly in recent months. Most of the whining is by analysts on BNN, industry groups (CAPP), and Jason Kenney/UCP.

7884 2018-04-01 20:20:02 #UKOG #HorseHill 2016 This simple vertical well has achieved an impressive aggregate oil rate equivalent to 8.5% of total UK onshore daily oil production.”
7885 2018-04-01 20:20:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
7886 2018-04-01 20:19:54 I guess she spurned his offer to buy the oil paintings?
7887 2018-04-01 20:19:49 I appreciate your links to the truth, but the people that you’re trying to reach don’t care about facts. The have been brainwashed by the POTUS/ snake oil salesman that everything else is fake and is not to be believed. Still Keep up the good fight.

7890 2018-04-01 20:19:02 Hamas is fighting for freedom from west interference. West paints them as boggie man. So after all we know you still believe west hype. There is always 2 sides to a story & you think we’re the good guys. Bombed hell out of ME for oil & you believe we’re still nice

7893 2018-04-01 20:18:36 Cannabis oil is not an ingredient of the sss. The only products that has it is are the loud black soap and cleanser
7894 2018-04-01 20:18:22 I think you would like the Micellar oil as the last product xx
7895 2018-04-01 20:17:57 I don’t know exactly what fucking meals my mom makes but somehow she gets oil all over the kitchen floor and I have almost slipped like four times within the week.

7897 2018-04-01 20:17:35 @NPR Stephon Clark wasn't just shot in the back. He was shot 2 times in the front and 6 in the back. Don't distort the #fakenews and pour oil in the fire!
7898 2018-04-01 20:17:16 We armed & funded jihadi headchoppers there for years.  Where was his concern about peace then?  Suddenly, Trump is saying, Hey, maybe we shouldn't be imperialist pigs and now he's worried about "peace".  No, by his own words he's worried about losing control of Syria's oil.
7899 2018-04-01 20:17:16 Evan is too polite. Minister’s plan is ineffective. Her 1 size fits all carbon tax is being imposed on two provinces that have already met their targets while Alberta is giving its oil/gas sector 25% emissions increase. Anyone who objects to this is a “denier”. A bankrupt plan.
7900 2018-04-01 20:17:14 Oil I think
7901 2018-04-01 20:16:53 I wouldn't know. The pantywaist blocked me ages ago.
7902 2018-04-01 20:16:42 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
7903 2018-04-01 20:16:18 So long as you roasted it tossed in oil and some salt and pepper you’re golden
7904 2018-04-01 20:15:39 It is not about oil, it is about Alberta oil. 
Desmog states that the lower mainland can import all the oil they need by sea. Likely from dictatorships or enemies. They want to deny Canadians of $15 billiion a year in tax money to show the world how progressive they are.
7905 2018-04-01 20:15:37 In 2015, Three people are killed in an explosion aboard a PEMEX oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico.

7909 2018-04-01 20:14:20 Pump oil out of the ground? Your baby will get the bill.

(Oil consumption today = reduced supply in the future = higher prices in the future)
7910 2018-04-01 20:14:11 This is common knowledge, or should be. The goal should be how to get off oil and onto cleaner ways of producing energy, lest the movie waterworld becomes a documentary.
7911 2018-04-01 20:14:00 Ohtani time!!!
7912 2018-04-01 20:13:52 The one time I take a full bottle of something out of town it spills smh. Almond oil gone to shit all in the bottom of a ziplock bag.
7913 2018-04-01 20:13:44 Is a major shareholder of the oil Wells or the modular refineries
7914 2018-04-01 20:13:39 I drive a full size truck (for good reason).  I heat my house in the winter.   I still want alternatives to fracking & fossil based energy.  I believe big oil/energy has way too much of a voice in energy policy.  This ad only makes reasonable people hate you more.
7915 2018-04-01 20:13:33 No recipe. Just seasoned with toasted sesame oil, salt and pepper.
7916 2018-04-01 20:13:22 Black olive spread sounds good with some bread toasted with a little olive oil and garlic.
7917 2018-04-01 20:13:14 Proverbs 5:3 For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and a mouth smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword.
7918 2018-04-01 20:12:45 Remember  your other Nafta partner, “biggest provider of energy to the U.S. — in terms of oil, gas, uranium and  electric power  at which the Us get at a low price

In case your wondered how dinner preparations were going @stacy_koster
7920 2018-04-01 20:12:17 During the same time frame, ND increased funding for education while experimenting the same oil and gas boom. While having a higher GPT to boot.
7921 2018-04-01 20:12:04 Try coconut oil
7922 2018-04-01 20:11:48 Yeah Leicester said that..

Can you explain the 13 years before our Russian oil money?
7923 2018-04-01 20:11:34 Time for us to do to @sinclairmedia what we did to Ma Bell and Standard Oil. Break up the monopolies.
7924 2018-04-01 20:11:16 May he slip and fall in a pool of oil.

7926 2018-04-01 20:11:14 annat box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
7927 2018-04-01 20:11:01 Your outlook has some common sense behind it.
7928 2018-04-01 20:10:53 You’re right, it’s not just oil and gas that are responsible. Our legislators are responsible as well for not properly funding education from the start. Education IS our 1st priority.
7929 2018-04-01 20:10:48 There are enough oil barons and oligarchs out there who could be interested in throwing euros at a team. Doesn't have to be him.
7930 2018-04-01 20:10:36 A sobering thought...
7931 2018-04-01 20:10:33 My dog is in a lot of pain and I wanted to use CBD oil do I need to get a dog specific oil or a regular one will work fine?

7933 2018-04-01 20:10:23 So what exactly are you two reffering to when you say give oil companies. The only thing govs give oil companies is a break on how much money they take from them. Like saying the gov gives to citizens by not taking the other 40% of gross income they dont take.
7934 2018-04-01 20:10:14 For you I pour it out for you I pour it out praise like oil
7935 2018-04-01 20:10:08 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
7936 2018-04-01 20:10:04 Have u seen and heard some of Oklahoma's congressional members? oil companies got billions in tax relief

7939 2018-04-01 20:09:12 1-And note what he said after your quote - Control over oil is the only influence we have in Syria today. “We have this 30 percent slice of Syria, which is probably where 90 percent of the pre-war oil production took place,” said David Adesnik....
7940 2018-04-01 20:08:55 @pnutxx wya ? My boy need a oil change
7941 2018-04-01 20:08:53 *watching a stripper cover themselves in baby oil*

What are you, some sort of baby?
7942 2018-04-01 20:08:49 I had a bad week and took it out on Kody, Gary.  We’re good now.  There will be dancing and oil again.
7943 2018-04-01 20:08:24 Guauuuuu quien estuviera en Graná ahora para comer un plato como ese
7944 2018-04-01 20:08:17 Haha. Just looks like a completely different hitter. Rarely chases stuff out of the zone, whereas he used to do it every AB in the past.
7945 2018-04-01 20:08:07 Fuk it clutch kit and oil lines it’ll be
7946 2018-04-01 20:07:38 There are all kinds of lobbies out there - the Saudi regime lobbies for cheap arms in exchange for oil, for example. 
I am against them just as strongly. 

As previously - these are human rights issues.
7947 2018-04-01 20:07:35 I prefer to be an MNO.
1000 Dash can be revalued and then I can buy 4 Lambos.
In addition, a Lambo requires repair, change of oil, rubber ... only spend.
1000 Dash will not bother me so much;)
7948 2018-04-01 20:07:28 Expelling 60 Russians is not pushing back? How about increasing US oil & natural gas exports, which hurts Russia's economy? Is that not pushback? Trump didn't do like Obama & said "cut it out," but he has certainly pushed back.
7949 2018-04-01 20:07:19 Coconut oil has changed the game for my hair 
7950 2018-04-01 20:06:52 Every time I see this oil & gas industry bullshit in my feed I will post to cost you money. #polluters
7951 2018-04-01 20:06:32 I dont like bitches tht got a permament oil stain on the forehead
7952 2018-04-01 20:06:24 Usually around 131 or 132 for a good medium rare. I don’t sear on the grill to finish; I sear in a screaming hot cast iron pan in oil, butter, garlic, & thyme for about 40 seconds per side (and around the edges.) On the side burner of the grill outside, because lots of smoke!
7953 2018-04-01 20:06:20 The problem right now is he is dragging down line-mates on any line he plays on and, if that continues, he'll need to be on the 4th line.  With that said, he' is only 29, going through some personal issues and is a great bounce-back candidate next season as a proud pro
7954 2018-04-01 20:06:17 i love it also, i just use cocoa butter more bc i’m trying to stay away from too much mineral oil!
7955 2018-04-01 20:06:12 All eyes toward the Fourth Circuit which is weighing whether to find Kinder Morgan for pipeline oil spill that seeped through groundwater and contaminated nearby streams in South Carolina. And yes the coal ash case too!!
7956 2018-04-01 20:06:07 What car/truck you servicing?
Ever cut and look inside your old oil filter to see what's going on inside your engine?
7957 2018-04-01 20:05:56 Hanging around family isn't fun for me anymore. All they talk about is sports, alcohol, politics, oil, and more alcohol. I might rush outta here in an hour or two, I'm going insane...
7958 2018-04-01 20:05:48 And if he hits 25 goals, the haters will still say we pay too much for him... let them hate.  I’m out
7959 2018-04-01 20:05:43 That's nothing i was making fries, they took the fries alongside the oil and that's not acceptable at all
7960 2018-04-01 20:05:42 3/3 Iran has a lot of its own oil, and it's not our business to "control" Syria's oil to prevent them from deciding where it goes. That's theft, pure and simple
7961 2018-04-01 20:05:36 2- He thinks we should remain in this illegal war to have the right to "control" the oil to ensure that only we decide where it goes. If that's not stealing, what is?
7962 2018-04-01 20:05:27 And now that oil companies are becoming more profitable they decide to bail on their corporate US HQ?  Reuters: “Shell's profit surges as oil sector rebounds”. It’s their money but they got a lot of value from that sponsorship. And, good will, which is hard to come by.
7963 2018-04-01 20:05:25 Idk, I’m partially proud and a little disturbed. I hope he teaches her how to disarm someone with a gun. That would be kind of cool, too. And maybe teach her how to change the oil in her car. She’s just a kid, it’s a little morbid. Have a tea party with her, too.
7964 2018-04-01 20:05:15 1-Yeah, nice little disclaimer after THIS - "Perhaps he would back off his urge to cut and run if he knew that the United States and its partners control almost all of the oil. And if the United States leaves, that oil will likely fall into the hands of Iran."
7965 2018-04-01 20:04:30 Why would I have video? You don’t have a phone on you when you’re cleaning up and oil spill dude
7966 2018-04-01 20:04:15 Sure looked good in his last two ABs....... #GrandSlam
7967 2018-04-01 20:03:57 You know; I’m not sure why ppl feel the need to use motor oil on their car - I just use Coppertone on the hood & roof & my car NEVER gets sunburned- I guess some ppl just think they are more fancy than others
7968 2018-04-01 20:03:52 Anybody know where i can get the oil lubricant for hair clippers!?
7969 2018-04-01 20:03:51 Maybe it's time to stop spreading this Snake Oil Salesman's rhetoric.  Let @davidhogg111 slither back into the depths of anonymity and everyone will be happier.

7973 2018-04-01 20:03:23 Or it’s an outlier season. We will know that for sure at about this time next year.
7974 2018-04-01 20:03:15 They should just rebrand to nbcspews.
7975 2018-04-01 20:03:12 Tread carefully that I claim that I actually worked for former Secretary of HUD, Joseph A. Califano, Jr., in Washington, D.C.?  And that I worked for former Secretary of the Interior, Gale A. Norton when she went from the Bush WH to Shell Oil? OK. Whatever.
7976 2018-04-01 20:02:43 Agree. Common sense.
7977 2018-04-01 20:02:36 18% of the entire nat'l 2030 GHG budget that you have agreed to set aside for oilsands producers. Which  Cdns/sectors do you propose to cut off from Cdn resource access to cover this 2030 GHG budget allocation to heavy oil exports? Please, share the facts as you understand them.

7982 2018-04-01 20:01:49 Exactly! Increased in oil prices on 2014 was global. Today's price is national - due to peso devaluation and TRAIN law!
7983 2018-04-01 20:01:40 Yeah right. I left a pool of oil behind
7984 2018-04-01 20:01:28 Don't forget that #Jesus was murdered for helping the poor and sick. Not the wealthy. He gave a very potent medicine known as the annointing oil to the people and it was no longer just for the high priest. #TheMoreYouKnow #SayHisName

7992 2018-04-01 20:00:30 Our green power production is maxed out. And the expansion of renewable alternatives does not meet a potential increase in demand from e g electrifying cars. An increase in demand for electric power means an increase in margin power production which in turn means coal, gas, oil.

Was it ok for Leave Campaign to exceed spending limits by transferring excess funds to Beleave?
8006 2018-04-01 19:57:03 I did some research on that a while ago. I was shocked to learn that Mexico's biggest export, oil brought less money to their economy that US dollars sent back.
8007 2018-04-01 19:57:01 Btw haven’t changed my oil in over a year lol cause I don’t care!... actually I do care I don’t recommend any of y’all to do that.

8008 2018-04-01 19:56:54 Ouch. 
Stop dairy. Less alcohol. Cut bad sugars. Eat berries and Vitamin C. Drink lots of water and green tea. Change your pillowcase. Add coconut oil to your diet. Wash your face with gentle products.

8011 2018-04-01 19:55:36 There are many states considering the legalization of hitting protesters with your car. These laws are being promoted by the oil industry and other polluters who want to demonize protest beyond the standard tactic of long jail sentences for civil disobedience.

8013 2018-04-01 19:55:34 Trump is keeping his promises. My husband & I both got big bonuses when Trump signed the tax plan. The Ameican oil industry is thriving. Plus there's a deep state swamp he's draining. #MAGA
8014 2018-04-01 19:55:31 Hi Fiona I like it feeling soft not taught or dry if that makes sense.  I then follow with prolagene gel and my balm. Last night I used oil then water.  Skin felt a little taught so wondered if I had done it the right way round xx

8017 2018-04-01 19:54:36 Our corrupt minister which is hidden now and out of service is, he always said we will raise our produce of oil to a point that won’t need Iraq and we can pay salary of all the kurdistan Employees in full also we will work for having 24h electric in Kurdistan 
8018 2018-04-01 19:54:23 Triggered. Time for some meditation and lavender oil.
8019 2018-04-01 19:54:14 Same thing happened with the Real Estate Wealth conference last year. These ppl are snake oil salesmen peddling get rich quick schemes
8020 2018-04-01 19:54:04 The reason we didn’t go to bed until 5 am besides going out, was bc Luis put tea tree oil on his lips and he was freaking out bc his lips went numb
8021 2018-04-01 19:53:51 I read the article but as long as we put education as the secondary in the conversation it will fail. My premise is this... save oil and gas for another day because the money for education should be 1 on the list to fund. Once that is signed THEN tackle them.
8022 2018-04-01 19:53:51 Here’s a recipe for you:

1. Slice a head of pointed cabbage into four wedges.
2. Rub with olive oil, roast for 40 minutes in 225°c oven.
3. Brown 50g butter, add a tablespoon of soy sauce. Add hazelnuts or Zaatar for style.
4. Drizzle on cabbage, eat with whatever.
8023 2018-04-01 19:53:42 I just elaborated and broke down what oil and dabs are to my dad happy Easter y’all 
8024 2018-04-01 19:53:33 The Saudis are preparing for a future where oil remains just as important to the global economy as it is today.
8025 2018-04-01 19:53:08 Olive oil and Montreal Chicken Spice.  She is fully stuffed too. Neck and chest cavity.  Brined for 25 hours too (increases moisture capture by 18-20% or so I have read).  Water bath underneath is important to keep the moisture during cook
8026 2018-04-01 19:53:07 What a bunch of nonsense. So, the Swiss democracy is all broken, yes? Referendums give us snake oil peddlers? Earth to Major Tim: all politicians are snake oil peddlers.

I'm really fed up with morons who think they know better than the people what's good for the country.
8027 2018-04-01 19:53:04 I hate say this I kind of agree with Trump about Amazon. Not his fake facts. Amazon has become the Standard Oil of the retail world and is fast moving into entertainment. Jeff Bezos is the John D Rockefeller of our age.
8028 2018-04-01 19:53:01 And why do you think that is gentlemen? It's not about this season. That ship sailed long ago. They need Lucic next yr to be a contributor and not a 3rd line guy.

Enjoy his show. No questions
8033 2018-04-01 19:52:18 When you are 23-24, a bad season is just an off-year.  When you are 29, there is a legitimate chance that the season is the start of a decline, not just an off-year.  Next season will show what this year was for Lucic.
8034 2018-04-01 19:52:13 "Breath Easter now; you sergèd fellowships,
You vigil-keepers with low flames decreased,
God shall o’er-brim the measures you have spent
With oil of gladness, for sackcloth and frieze
And the ever-fretting shirt of punishment
Give myrrhy-threaded golden folds of ease."

8035 2018-04-01 19:51:59 Please stop misleading the public on this most serious issue. There hasn't been a debate on the legitimacy of the science in a long time now. Even oil companies and the US Pentagon accept the the science and are aware of the consequences.

8039 2018-04-01 19:50:28 What he seems to saying here is that we cling to figures like Trump, in the hope that we can be re-enchanted. But it is all in vain. He is just another snake oil merchant

To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.
8048 2018-04-01 19:48:53 Looks like he's got a fart stuck sideways.  Some essential oil for that?
8049 2018-04-01 19:48:38 Ok so the talking point is invalid.  You can be against oil pipelines and mining and at same time demand oil products and a lifestyle that benefits from it?  Invalid or is it hard to defend bashing oil on a product that is made directly/indirectly from oil
8050 2018-04-01 19:48:36 @kenjilopezalt I have an interesting challenge for you, if you ever feel like taking it on. I have heard everyone rave about how good mapo tofu is, and I would love to try it, but I'm allergic to soy. I can do soy sauce or oil, but nothing with soy protein. Help?
8051 2018-04-01 19:48:36 And he has had a blip in his performance (about 5 years ago) and it lasted 1 season.. With a little confidence instilled in him, he'll bounce back.  The haters won't agree.

8056 2018-04-01 19:47:56 Really? When you remove a top six winger who made $6M & replace him w/ another winger who makes $6M what would that be? For god sake, that's even how they tried spinning it at the time. Larsson & Lucic made it essentially 2-for-1. Go back and read everything following the trade.

8059 2018-04-01 19:47:02 @cathmckenna in a moment of impolitic honesty: "I know that enabling the expansion of the tar sands, the oil patch, makes it almost impossible to meet our climate commitments, but I have to bribe Alberta with KM to get its support for these commitments".

8068 2018-04-01 19:46:13 Hi Deepak. With our LP license we are not permitted to cultivate. The activities listed on the license are all related to producing oil. Why the HC site listed it as a “cultivation” license is unclear at this time. IMO it was probably being the first one that caused confusion.
8069 2018-04-01 19:46:11 Somewhere in a darkly lit beige room with black and white pictures of grass hung on the wall, Gareth Southgate sits under an oil lamp in his slightly damp, piss stained y-fronts believing his man management of Dele Alli created that performance today.

8076 2018-04-01 19:44:55 Hydro's deal with NSP uses Maritime Link 2 sell excess power at New England grid price--much lower than kWh-cost Nalcor wants for us. Why give cheap energy to NS?

8077 2018-04-01 19:44:48 The US never made a claim to Syrian oil. Its oil companies help build the Saudi pipeline to the Med, after the Soviet/Syrian attempt to overthrow Lebanon failed in the 1950s, the pipeline was abandoned. Other means were found for transport of Saudi crude.
8078 2018-04-01 19:44:38 @paulgigotCMUNCE Question: What’s the difference in Amazon now and Standard Oil position years ago? A monopoly is a monopoly if they control most aspects of an operation.  I can’t believe some politicians think a lot of business is good for the post office, even if at a loss!
8079 2018-04-01 19:44:38 COSMOPOLITAN: Often use an essential oil.
8080 2018-04-01 19:44:23 More fear mongering by protesters. Oil is used in everything we use

No need salt or pepper. Just add olive oil and eat.
8083 2018-04-01 19:44:00 Looch was never brought in to replace Hall  That is laughable.  Hall HAD to go.  Oilers needed a big forward who could help buy time and space for the smaller faster forwards.  Big difference.

Not everyone uses Facebook. The demographic more likely to use it were younger who had a propensity to vote remain.

I'd also challenge govt extending the voter registration date - very suspect.

8097 2018-04-01 19:42:08 Yup. Looking more like that on a daily. Even when it comes to oil spills, oil firms always paint bunkerers as the main culprit.

8103 2018-04-01 19:41:16 Without it tourism increased at least  5.4% per year. All that was necessary was the all clear from the Deep Horizon oil spill. Storms and oils spill have short term impact on tourism. But the environmental damage from hotels on the beach and bridges is forever.
8104 2018-04-01 19:41:16 It’s a gel not a oil but it has oil in it!
8105 2018-04-01 19:40:56 The US would love a revolution in Iran just now. Less effort to get to your resources. (Oil).
8106 2018-04-01 19:40:49 Why do you think oil causes #climate refugees? Oil and reliable power/equipment make it possible for ppl to survive extreme weather events and rebuild and stay where they like to live.

8136 2018-04-01 19:34:21 As someone who has actually gone to school for this not just read google articles or heard a vet talk about it, usually CBD oil does not work well in dogs, if it does at all. Plus the dosing can be very touchy and can have more side effects than anything good

8143 2018-04-01 19:31:28 Yeah but Iran has underground missiles cities also the whole oil rich gulf states coast just 100 miles away from Iran coast on the other side of the gulf. If these things really happened the world will see economic collapses in the far east, middle East, Europe and USA.

8155 2018-04-01 19:29:59 I have been at my folks' for less than an hr. Mom hasn't seen me in 3 months. Already she's wondered if my diet is working, said she prefers me blonde, yelled at me for not using the pricey snake oil she bought me and has roped me into sorting her printer out. #HappyEaster

8159 2018-04-01 19:29:44 Sorry about the last tweet. For a brief moment I pictured you as the oil queen and I was the butler.

@realDonaldTrump Mexico's cash cow is not NAFTA, it is the Remittances sent to Mexico in excess of $26,000,000,000 annually.
These remittances have surpassed Oil as Mexico's largest source of revenue!

8179 2018-04-01 19:24:09 US troops have had to fight off Russian mercenaries, oligarchs, who want oil fields in Syria. Russia wants oil?
8180 2018-04-01 19:23:57 Just five or so years before, the ON government participated in an oil sands bailout. Syncrude was in trouble because Atlantic Richfield decided to back out of its 30% stake. The PET (15%), AB (10%), and ON (5%) governments chipped in to keep the project afloat. Some thanks.

8191 2018-04-01 19:22:28 There is an argument that burning oil is the same. It was carbon sequestered in the earth through natural processes and we just tapped back into it. It isn’t net new carbon for the earth. We’re just putting it back
8192 2018-04-01 19:22:26 My oldest son was covered in oil from swapping his gf's engine and went to the liquor store to get a drink and someone gave him $2. There are still good people in the world. I know my son will pay that forward.  He's a good kid

8195 2018-04-01 19:22:18 You have a problem with the ayatollah because their country has vast oil deposits. If they had no oil the u.s. and Israel could care less about them.
8196 2018-04-01 19:22:06 But that is complete bs. The big pharma outfits are no different these days to snake oil salesman with a caravan selling elixirs. But you can't argue with them since they get to the doctors then the families first and then forget it. You've lost any discussion.

8216 2018-04-01 19:18:40 Yes but didn’t the others add oil production as an additional licensed activity under the auspices of an existing LP license? There’s no such thing as a stand-alone oil license to my knowledge, which is why Production license seems like the right fit???

8218 2018-04-01 19:18:35 David, I can’t disprove a negative. That’s impossible. Anymore I can disprove holy water doesn’t work, it’s  an old snake oil salesman’s trick

8221 2018-04-01 19:17:55 He's a snake oil salesman and an idiot. A real salesman wouldn't have to fear saying something stupid that would fuck themselves over. Salesman are masters of words and language, what you're suggesting is Fat Nixon is the opposite of that.
8222 2018-04-01 19:17:49 A lot of his pictures are from news and oil/gas industry stock photos. He and his buddies look like extras from a Netflix Russian cop show.

8224 2018-04-01 19:17:30 As I remember it Black River i think is the the main source of water for the area. From what I know about even fracking the deeper you go you do come in contact with water or sumn to that effect. But I always suspected oil or a natural gas find in that area

8227 2018-04-01 19:17:01 We don't want Scott Pruit either but there has got to be some common sense alternate in the middle, like apply the same standards to imported oil at least and buy Canadian for Christ's sake (that's my Easter part).
8228 2018-04-01 19:16:59 But if they touch their hair with gloves on, the oil and dirt still gets on the gloves... And then transfers to the food. So yeah, gloves don't really stop anything like that.

They can prevent cross contamination if you switch gloves, but that's not the same.

8241 2018-04-01 19:15:22 Nope. Doesn’t belong in league. Name me a player remaining in nhl with his foot speed.  If he was that slow and could thread the needle w passes maybe. But he’s a shit passer too.  Watch his shifts.  He destroys offensive attacks on rush or cycle all the time.
8242 2018-04-01 19:14:58 At no point was it suggested McLellan "should" be fired if Lucic was used strictly in a B6 role. Rather that he "would've" been fired long ago. Two completely different things.
8243 2018-04-01 19:14:55 A landowner in St Elizabeth Jamaica has listed his property for nearly $9 billion, citing the prospect of offshore oil discoveries

8245 2018-04-01 19:14:45 Lucic contract was an overpayment, but 4 other teams were willing to pay him what he got (& more), so cost was artificially inflated by GMs. Whether or not Chiarelli should’ve paid the price is another story. Everyone knew he would decline, but didn’t expect it in YR 2/7.
8246 2018-04-01 19:14:43 They just got bored of testing missiles. So there must be oil or something around the peninsula.

8264 2018-04-01 19:11:43 Lucic was not “bad” last yr, he should be expected to score 20G, which he did last year. He failed miserably this year, and I doubt he scores 20G again. Even if he bounces back next year, he’ll be in the 10-19G range for the rest of that deal (probably low side), he’s declining

8274 2018-04-01 19:10:49 Don't agree with you there. For me, the only issue with Milan is his ticket & term.  A 40pt-50pt player isn't someone who has had the game pass him by. No question he is no longer as effective as he once was but far from a guy who doesn't belong in the league.
8275 2018-04-01 19:10:34 @EvanLSolomon then why does the government continue to promote oil and other climate changing technologies?

8423 2018-04-01 18:45:39 For years it was “Alberta’s oil” and the rest of Canada could go pound sand.

Buh we be here earning less and be eating pizza  and sipping on some juice 

God really blessing us and we don’t see. We just want more money

8432 2018-04-01 18:44:29 i am 40 minutes away from crispeddi (a savoury Calabrian treat, like doughnuts, but savory, and made from risen potato & flour dough).  They are best right out of the hot oil, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, they are the besssst

8445 2018-04-01 18:43:14 We make a business off of what's limited as well. Ingredients like palm oil, and such have demolished ecosystems. Like the energies we use that are limited, where our limits exist, we've created them.

8452 2018-04-01 18:42:22 He is 100% correct! Currently, BJP govt is busy in preparing The Pakodas for 2019 and 2022. @narendramodi hope you are using Good Refined oil which is good for the health of Indians. Please don’t use the oil from 2014 year.
8453 2018-04-01 18:42:13 Oil change time. Pray that ya boy gets JUST an oil change.
8454 2018-04-01 18:42:04 I believe he or his goons might've done some kind of scam on subsidized Kerosene oil too, btw he's in prison for like nothing... His deeds and corruption is much more than the fodder scam.
8455 2018-04-01 18:41:42 Maybe best friend had that dream. He became a geologist for oil companies and makes a shit load of money. At least you know there’s an out if he changes his mind lol. I wanted to be one too. I undershot it a little lol

8457 2018-04-01 18:41:14 A good vinegar (balsamic, sherry, champagne, or apple cider) with a flavorful oil (a good olive oil, avocado oil, walnut oil, almond oil, etc.) is my preference. And I generally prefer beets and some fruit in my green salad, like apples, pears, or dried cranberries.

8470 2018-04-01 18:39:57 Hi Lily! I was curious about how to work rosehip oil into my routine? I oil cleanse/moisturize with jojoba, should I put a few drops of rosehip in my jojoba after hydrating? @caveofbeauty
8471 2018-04-01 18:39:56 Bliss has some of the best skin care I’ve tried in a while. I need their oil UGH
8472 2018-04-01 18:39:53 We've very few saltwater lakes compared to fresh water, and it's not the saltwater that makes them a carbon sink. We still pollute more per capita than most places in the world with our coal electricity and oil industry, and agriculture running mostly on diesel.
8473 2018-04-01 18:39:07 i will boo! whenever i take it home to have my dad change the oil i'm gonna make him drive it and see what he thinks the problem is before we do anything to it 
8474 2018-04-01 18:38:59 i’ve been using castor oil and coconut oil so my hair better grow 5 inches by the summer
8475 2018-04-01 18:38:21 whomst even put oil glands on the chest? like there is no good biological reason to be able to get pimples there !!??
8476 2018-04-01 18:38:06 It's the same thing that condoms are lubricated with, so you can just rub a condom on the inner part of the black tube and the sliding potentiometers and that should do the job.
(I haven't actually done this though, always applied the oil with a Q-tip.)
8477 2018-04-01 18:37:30 burned some oil at my grandparents assisted living apartment and the alarm's been going off for 20 minutes so i ruined easter 
8478 2018-04-01 18:37:27 @dorion_niprock my crispeddi are rising!!!! 40 mins until i start heating the oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8479 2018-04-01 18:37:21 Small joys in life, morning run, eucalyptus oil in the diffuser and crocheting a blanket for my mom. Just a happy happy day
8480 2018-04-01 18:37:19 At that time, reading the news avidly, I got the strong impression that they wanted to destabilize the country because they saw it as a personal $$$-making opportunity (oil etc).

Looking back, my news sources were questionable but I wonder if there’s some truth here.
8481 2018-04-01 18:37:10 The brilliant climatologist and prophet PM Jean Chretien turned down the offer for Kyoto forest credits in order to be admired by and enrich billionaire African dictators, while helping Maurice Strong (Iraq oil scandal) build dozens of coal fired power plants in China.
8482 2018-04-01 18:37:00 Good point. I’ll adjust my timeframe and say I don’t expect oil demand to wane within my lifetime. Reasonable enough for me 
8483 2018-04-01 18:36:52 If you do a big chop it’s even better babe. Apply castor oil twice a week to help your hair grow quicker. Do hair mask and drink lots of water it helps ! Use products like deva curl or shea moisture and try not to apply heat the less heat the healthier and quicker it will be !

8486 2018-04-01 18:36:39 Hold a manufacturer responsible...Hummm? Dewpont? Smith and Wesson? Oil companies and fracking? Strip miners? And a whole host of others? Maybe this is how we can get our money back from these rich pricks. Make them pay for cleaning up their messes and any loss of life incurred.

8490 2018-04-01 18:35:59 Try making your own at home, easy and you make them tasty with the correct oil and condiments, low salt is a must. There are crisp trays purchase one.

8504 2018-04-01 18:34:01 Me too. Did hubris play an out sized role? Remember when Cheney brought all the oil co. execs in for a meeting in the very early phase of Bush's first term? Seems related. Paul Bremer's decisions as head of Provisional Authority, a disaster.
8505 2018-04-01 18:33:55 That was polluted by big oil, maybe on purpose... I have yet to see it..
8506 2018-04-01 18:33:55 BIO OIL!!!!! Literally drown yourself in it. It’s the best the prevent stretch marks/help the ones you have.

8512 2018-04-01 18:33:11 @DanielLMcAdams the US and its 'SDF' construct are only in northeastern Syria in order to make sure Damascus cannot control its own oil in order to strangle the country, in hopes of fomenting more unrest, destablizing Syria.
8513 2018-04-01 18:32:56 did she every do anything for Scotland except steal our oil and start wars to kill our young
8514 2018-04-01 18:32:51 Very little of Saudi oil ever came to US market (most came from Canada and Mexico). The US-Saudi relationship cemented on security guarantee and the fact that Saudi upheld petrodollars. Saudi/OPEC  oil invoiced in dolllar is a boon for US economy.
8515 2018-04-01 18:32:46 Most were violent. Arpaio not convicted of a violent crime.  Arnold is an idiot. He’s trying to sue oil companies for murder. Brown is a lunatic. Train no one wants for billions of dollars. State laws which violate federal law.

8517 2018-04-01 18:32:25 I use some very good shampoos based in coconut water or oil (change between them)... Sometimes, I do not use shampoo at all, just conditioner to wash hair (also based on coconut!  ). Washing hair just once a week...

8527 2018-04-01 18:31:27 Ace! Measurements: 3/4 cup water to a sachet of yeast and a tsp of sugar. Allow to froth for 10 mins, then add to 1.5 cups flour with the rest mixed in to taste (approx 1 tsp each is a good starting point). Prove for 1h, stir again then deep fry table spoonfuls in hot hot oil.
8528 2018-04-01 18:31:24 Oil is range bound $58-$66.66, best is to trade ST in both directions for 0.50 to $1.40
8529 2018-04-01 18:31:22 It's no surprise that the southern, "family of faith" would hire racist ass Mike Ditka to pitch their snake oil. Hilariously cliché! 
8530 2018-04-01 18:31:20 @ONfinance Canada is large procurer of oil still why are normal canadain is payting almost doble price of gas at pump station. Why govement is making so much profit from it?
8531 2018-04-01 18:31:15 Only conclusion I can come to is big oil is putting cash into political pockets by the truck load.

8548 2018-04-01 18:28:39 I did read some bad breaking baking soda experience with daily use so maybe not wise to use it daily. More like deep cleaning.. hmm. Coconut oil: using always after wash to the ends/if need shine  Awesome stuff!

8552 2018-04-01 18:27:52 I read an article that oil and gas companies were making record profits back when gas prices were around $2.00 here in Nevada, not that long ago, and oil was $50 a barrel at the time. It's $3.00 a gallon now. Enough greed, enough suppression. Let other parts of the economy grow.
8553 2018-04-01 18:27:44 Eric Prydz b2b Carnage  Oil/Water have never mixed well
8554 2018-04-01 18:27:42 Just had two people at my door telling me how they had seen a South American oil producing shrub. 
They were Jojoba's witnesses.
8555 2018-04-01 18:27:29 But is it oil or water based? You can get eggshell in water based now. I ask because the fumes from the oil based paint are an issue if you're painting indoors and can't ventilate as it's so cold right now.
8556 2018-04-01 18:27:21 It's against my religion to eat palm oil. Now mske me a Twix without it! @twix
8557 2018-04-01 18:26:58 Get you a boy that puts on your tanning oil for you
8558 2018-04-01 18:26:58 We need a law that all media must give full disclosure of any financial interests in the war or oil industry, or the CIA...like a warning label. WaPo is working overtime to propagandize the idea that stealing Syria's oil is our right. That crap is straight from the warpigs in DC.
8559 2018-04-01 18:26:53 @pewdiepie WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO REVIEW THE AMERICAN OIL MEME!?
8560 2018-04-01 18:26:28 #PAKvWI the way West Indies is going down, they will soon discover oil.
8561 2018-04-01 18:26:25 Burning the midnight oil on a weekend. 
8562 2018-04-01 18:26:19 So I attempted my first singing swede this evening and it was delicious #vegetarian #vegan #swede post scoop, roasted in olive oil, loads of black pepper, diced peppers and diced haloumi

8566 2018-04-01 18:25:29 the only thing im thinking qpm could be is oil on water but those letters are no where near each other
8567 2018-04-01 18:25:26 "e-cigarettes and the oil based liquid that is used "
OIL BASED ???????????????
8568 2018-04-01 18:25:12 The absence of real numbers to support the oil discovery announcement makes me hold big celebrations for the time being. Yes, I am cautiously optimistic. #Bahrain #oilandgas #shale #discovery #economy
8569 2018-04-01 18:24:49 I've been wondering how long Alaskans will allow those oil guys to warehouse their reserves up here. Maybe we should reconsider that initiative of a few years back. We need the oil, not more empty promises.
8570 2018-04-01 18:24:32 somebody needs to find a way to build a bus that *makes* oil and then Calgary will be fine

8573 2018-04-01 18:24:04 I worked for a guy in LA yrs past had a 47 ft Criss Craft oil screw which was probably too big. That was a 'writer's experience'.
8574 2018-04-01 18:24:01 so i just put green tea, honey, coconut oil and lemon juice on my face. what did you do for your country today
8575 2018-04-01 18:23:50 You can spin around in the studios with these fake narration but your real fun (or worry) starts now! Govt had a bull run when barrel prices down, now with crude surging upwards will bring the govt down to its knees with inflated oil bill!
8576 2018-04-01 18:23:45 I'm rallying vote for @Dennis_Kucinich & @TaraLSamples - they stand with We the People. Not beholden to NRA, big oil, Pharma, medical industry-corporations in general. I'm for them because of ban fracking & assault weapons, #15by20, medicare for all, free college, JOBS. #OHGov
8577 2018-04-01 18:23:29 America’s great and good from the worlds of politics, business, oil, entertainment and tech are queueing up to meet the immensely powerful 32-year-old Mohammad bin Salman, or MBS as he is known, according to a 36-page document seen by The Independent.
8578 2018-04-01 18:23:22 the USA NICKS IRAQ OIL, the USA still in Iraq and operating there . in case you forget, as I said gets war compensation as well, believe it or not
8579 2018-04-01 18:23:20 I bought an oil burner over the weekend so I can burn scented oils to help me zen and cope... I’m still so sad that my baby died..... I’m still in shock
8580 2018-04-01 18:23:17 He also is an editor for a big oil magazine. Maybe it’s big oil keeping his name out of Canadian news.
8581 2018-04-01 18:23:10 LoL  ! Why are you burning the midnight oil? Go to sleep. 
8582 2018-04-01 18:22:38 @Madison420Ivy i thought i would let you know, my friend a seriously hot 21 yr old lesbian Michelle has just told me that she broke two vibrators watching you and august ames get it on in an oil massage. Michelle is now deeply in love with you.  she wants to marry you xx
8583 2018-04-01 18:22:35 Oil
8584 2018-04-01 18:22:21 I'm tired and I don't quite get what you mean, Bill. But one thing I always think is, Why doesn't ScotGov have a state oil company like Norway's Statoil?
8585 2018-04-01 18:22:21 *Sip Pepsi*
Hm, this tastes odd.
*Sips again.*
Oh yeah, the spatula from the frying pan rested on this. This is probably olive oil that has drained into this.
*Sip again*
Should probably get a straw.
*Sip*
8586 2018-04-01 18:22:17 You know you’re dating a health freak when, instead of coffee, he offers fish oil and/or a multi vitamin.
8587 2018-04-01 18:21:43 And then after.. slather them in chrism oil? .. and then maybe slap them (or not as the case may be)?
8588 2018-04-01 18:21:40 And my old Corvair used bulk oil 
It spit oil like it was water..
8589 2018-04-01 18:21:33 For the ladies who have to take care of their cars or guys who have access to make up removal wipes—- you can use them to clean your car cup holders, and wipe oil stains on exteriors of doors (just tried it and it worked) lol armor oil wipes are expensive

8591 2018-04-01 18:21:10 adding a drizzle of olive oil to my avo toast really, and i mean really, felt delectable
8592 2018-04-01 18:21:09 Try coconut oil if you got it
8593 2018-04-01 18:21:02 Cutler not a medium heat for the pan from the heat oil until chicken pieces to disturb the second time in chopped artichokes,
8594 2018-04-01 18:20:50 Oh, I can strongly recommend coconut oil! Have been using only coconut shampoo, balm and oil for many years now. It has never disappointed me.. 
8595 2018-04-01 18:20:50 Elites in west are worried about brics ... gold ..oil ... petroyuan
8596 2018-04-01 18:20:43 I can't understand why they won't get an oil production license now? What they are proposing is currently being done by others. I get the rationale about #CannabisAct and future licenses but that hasn't happened yet.
8597 2018-04-01 18:20:29 Okay, make me understand
8598 2018-04-01 18:20:28 I use coconut oil on my legs when I get irritation. Usually get irritated when my razor is getting old. Plus shaving cream makes me irritated! So I just use my body wash!
8599 2018-04-01 18:20:19 Yes! Same one and I gave myself a hot oil treatment with green tea, coconut oil and ginger
8600 2018-04-01 18:20:19 KirstyRo1986 Try a blend of coconut oil & dates, that should work. Will be super sweet though! #health #fitness #fit #healthy
8601 2018-04-01 18:20:16 Coconut oil make the curls go brazy 
8602 2018-04-01 18:20:00 And it's nothing new, either. This guy's entire career is in the pocket of oil.

8605 2018-04-01 18:19:49 More to the point, THE OIL AND GAS CAN'T LEAVE THE STATE BECAUSE IT'S IN THE GROUND. ENERGY COMPANIES COME TO IT. THE LEAVING THREAT IS A BS NEGOTIATING TACTIC. 

We lose more from having a state no one wants to move into because our infrastructure and education are trash.

8609 2018-04-01 18:19:37 I would shoot any invader who came into my home. They would probably be a white meth head. Trump took away DACA. Like a little brat blaming others. He hates Obama and couldn’t wait to undo his policies. P.S I’m republican, but can smell a snake oil salesman.
8610 2018-04-01 18:19:33 Those fools charged me a cool ONE HUNDRED dollars for a standard oil change. Never paid so much in my life and never going back there ever again!
8611 2018-04-01 18:19:30 As long as you bring the tour to North America 
8612 2018-04-01 18:19:26 I think its an oil based dressing used to add "nutty" flavor to some type of pasta. 

I think it may be like the peanut flavor in a Pad Thai.

Some think it's related to adrenal medullas but as someone who understands biochemistry I have a hard time believing this.
8613 2018-04-01 18:19:24 This is in the Middle East. Why I’m not surprised.

I take it every where with me. A small bottle of mouth spray. 
And I take two fish oil capsules a day. To help stop anxiety attacks hope this helps

8619 2018-04-01 18:18:49 Writing a poem in my head to the dumpling and chili oil/mustard/soy sauce combination, I learned the difference between the English poem and haiku: the former always an authorial and authorizing voice; the latter a shared set of perceptions, a sensorial proposition.
8620 2018-04-01 18:18:39 wtf how do you keep oil from staining your bed sheets?! i just got these 
8621 2018-04-01 18:18:37 What do think this means, Daniela? Why do you think the foolish virgins don’t prepare enough oil to last until the Bridegroom comes?
8622 2018-04-01 18:18:19 Hakane amma Allah baiche na chutu ba
8623 2018-04-01 18:18:09 Similar to how Rockefeller bought up all the other companies? Okay, but how about AT&T being forced to break up in the 80's to allow MCI to compete in the long distance markets? I could be wrong, but I don't recall reading AT&T being like Standard Oil where it bought up everyone.
8624 2018-04-01 18:18:01 What demand? OPEC is cutting production to artificially inflate  oil prices. In 10 years or less most cars sold will be electric. Oil will collapse long before that happens. Give it 2 years max and oil will be back to $10 a barrel
8625 2018-04-01 18:17:32 The ones who committed the JFK assassination  are now the people bringing Trump chaos. They’ve been planning this all along. Just waiting for peak oil to drive their hammer down on life. Nazis.

8629 2018-04-01 18:17:15 Are you using oil based or water based?
8630 2018-04-01 18:17:07 The oil industry knew for decades that climate change was real, was caused by humans and would potentially be catastrophic. via the years project
8631 2018-04-01 18:17:03 so true and kerosene oil used to be blacked and people in the street used to fight for it

8634 2018-04-01 18:16:37 Apparently olive/vegetable oil is good for that.
8635 2018-04-01 18:16:24 ugh my check engine light is on and i just got an oil change wtf is that
8636 2018-04-01 18:16:18 Govt.must play fare game in oil police.Why double standardsfor oil policy &policy for buisiness class.
Same in public &polititions
8637 2018-04-01 18:16:15 The brotherhood of the coast almost drove whales to extinction pursuing their oil and so moved inland to exploit oil from the ground.

8640 2018-04-01 18:15:31 Hi Marion. Why do you think the foolish virgins bring an insufficient quantity of oil as they wait for the coming of the Bridegroom?
8641 2018-04-01 18:15:25 Madam,

There is no reason to rise PETROLEUM product prices by State owned Oil Marketing Companies in India. Those highly profit making  Oil companies to fat their Management salaries abnormally they suck blood of poor people. IOC, BPCL, HPCL are anti-people.
8642 2018-04-01 18:15:12 I’m going to start using tanning oil and perfume... this stuff smells amazing

8645 2018-04-01 18:14:42 Yeah 10 Virgins with lamp oil really cleared it up for me. Try John 3.15. Isn't this is what today about or are you referring to April Fools???
8646 2018-04-01 18:14:35 are you ready to Pay a lot more for  Electric power oil and gas uranium  plus you think it good to lose your biggest customers who buy made in the USA ask Trump why he is playing this game
8647 2018-04-01 18:14:31 Congratulations to all of us....our affordability has indeed increased many fold that higher peices of petroleum products do not bother us any more unlike 4 years before when an increase by 50 paisa was too much to afford despite crude oil being at USD 110 a barrel.
8648 2018-04-01 18:14:09 Ok cool sorry about that. I get that he was a dictator but I think it was really something that Libya needed. Libya is rich in oil. Gaddafi wasn’t as greedy as mentioned. Nigga knew that not many would be selfless so he closed all avenues for opposition. At some point
8649 2018-04-01 18:14:08 Tea tree oil or even better @TropicSkincare tamanu rescue... Its brilliant works a treat!

8651 2018-04-01 18:14:07 Inflation was actually 27% at one point. this was due to more than one politicio-economic factor. UK had joined then EEC at this time point. The oil states cartel is OPEC, not APEC.
8652 2018-04-01 18:14:05 @larry_kudlow Want to help your friend John Bolton? Set the record straight on Iraq! There was no real economic recovery until a freed Iraq stepped up oil production.
8653 2018-04-01 18:13:59 Didi unfortunately we are not an oil producing nation and have no control over the World crude prices - and we in India still do not have cars running on mustard oil !
8654 2018-04-01 18:13:45 Used to live in. Jobs have been lost largely to the diminishing oil sector and people are seeing more break ins. But I would guess that most break ins are because of poverty. And not thrill seekers. I could be wrong but it would seem to make sense
8655 2018-04-01 18:13:39 Mixture needs more air  you need to wisk to get air into the mixture just before pouring into smoking hot oil - add a pinch of salt will help with the binding so more like to rise

8663 2018-04-01 18:12:38 The current pipeline can't handle supply. 
And, why would Alberta oil companies increase production, when they can't sell it? That would be silly.

8665 2018-04-01 18:12:26 Many of us have been saying all along that the illegal invasion of Syria was about stealing oil, despite Nikki Haley's cries of "Bad Assad!"

Now the CIA linked WaPo is admitting it. Imperialism is just exported fascism. Spare me your crap about democracy dying in darkness.

8670 2018-04-01 18:11:26 Kat structured the club to make it sellable. The sell and replace strategy was hers (or her advisors) as is showed the club was a money making machine. Snake oil stuff
8671 2018-04-01 18:11:14 Ok. I’ll take it as you say. But Venezuela became an independent oil nation after colonization and is now a communist tyranny. Replacing one perceived yoke for another one isn’t smart. The country must be prepared for democratic independence before expelling the colonial power
8672 2018-04-01 18:10:44 too much. pouring oil inside drinking water well is a cruel & inhuman act which only the communists can do in Gods own country

8690 2018-04-01 18:07:15 I’m really just washing my hair every other week and giving myself hot oil treatments but my hair is loving me back 
8691 2018-04-01 18:07:04 Just trying to recall the dialogue of Sushma Ji.. remember what was that ... At time of UPA... NDA is failed on two promises, big relief in tax to middle class and oil prices..
8692 2018-04-01 18:06:54 Insurance companies know & are pricing accordingly. The oil & gas & insurance industries have some of the most comprehensive data on human caused climate change, including mapping. 

Ppl planning sensibly for their own financial future shld be taking climate change seriously.

8695 2018-04-01 18:06:11 @HRDMinistry I still feel its a billion $ industry or else how can paper be circulated & distributed across all territory of India. Pl look at de role of CBSE. My common military knowledge suggest it is a well oil business like med edn. U have to make an example out of CBSE staff
8696 2018-04-01 18:06:01 They may not be bots but if you believe they're all regular normal people who are not being paid by either the Kochs, Big Auto, or Big Oil then think again. Vast amounts of cash loiter behind the doom-and-gloom that is being pushed. The challenge is to ignore it
8697 2018-04-01 18:05:46 I did an oil treatment in my hair (olive, coconut, castor & almond oil) and it actually looks a bit less dry than before wow
8698 2018-04-01 18:05:32 What does Nigeria has to show since freed from Britain in 1960? Coup de tas till 2000? Rich in oil in continent but no fuel, electricity. Five million kids under 5 not at school. All these are man made .

8704 2018-04-01 18:03:28 They didn't know it was Krillitane Oil, but they knew something was up with it. Rose might not have been eating chips from the school at this point but I think Mickey's comment was just used to foreshadow what the oil was used for, nothing more. chips = bad in story context

8707 2018-04-01 18:03:21 Before we go all gushy over US-Saudi relationship, let’s be clear: The relationship can still prove useful. But oil for security trade-off that powered bond has broken down. US less dependent on their oil; and they rightly shouldn’t bank on us to guarantee their security.
8708 2018-04-01 18:03:18 doing really amateurish oil pastel things
8709 2018-04-01 18:03:09 Been out most of the day. Unreal some of the negative comments towards this share on LSE...seriously considering not posting on there any more...Heid only likes positivity.
8710 2018-04-01 18:03:08 Try a blend of coconut oil & dates, that should work. Will be super sweet though!
8711 2018-04-01 18:02:45 Sir, I am a @narendramodi supporter but inflation is down mainly because of global #crudeoil prices, which is not in control of Modiji. He got a huge tailwind on this. He was also hot by 2 draughts. Bringing food prices high. But WPI has higher influence of oil prices.
8712 2018-04-01 18:02:45 @AlfredoP with Natgas seasonality and forward EPS estimates for many oil/gas firms this looks like a low risk entry with very defined risk.
8713 2018-04-01 18:02:37 Please laugh to content till the time oil money drains outkafir Russians n Americans r producing enough themselves,world Kafirs won't need yousell it your Oic brothers thereafter
8714 2018-04-01 18:02:35 For now it looks like they will get "Cultivation" licences under #ACMPR. Under the #CannabisAct they will get "Processor" licenses. This will just add confusion within the industry/markets. If we have "Production" licenses now it makes sense for oil producers to get those IMO.
8715 2018-04-01 18:02:29 So, they wear manmade fibres (like that backpack in the background). Those are made with petroleum products. Oil is the residue of long dead dinosaurs. They are hypocritical MONSTERS !!!  (hey, it's April 1st).
8716 2018-04-01 18:02:25 Start using that retinol now! And facial oil. That stuff is your bff. You're beaut in any case, but dude, this was such a shock to me. I turned 30 and BAM! Skin got drier than the Sahara! No idea what happened.
8717 2018-04-01 18:02:06 Did y’all know that you should actually never cook with olive oil- only use it as a dressing. It is healthy, but it has a low burning point which can make ur food taste like shit.

8721 2018-04-01 18:01:31 Trillions have been spent on power projects, despite of reduced oil prices and increased power tariff the demon of loadsheding has not been controlled.
8722 2018-04-01 18:01:30 Depends on what you call a subsidy. Overall, oil and gas contribute hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy. The net flow of money is clearly one way. I don't call things like tax breaks a subsidy. I call that a discount. All taxation is theft.

8735 2018-04-01 17:58:34 Trump check, he only wants yes men and women in these positions. This way he can continue to line the pockets of the oil & gas & big companies that will give him kickbacks and help keep him in power.
8736 2018-04-01 17:58:15 I thought production and cultivation were the same, and "processing" is buying from an LP and creating something with it (extracted oil).
8737 2018-04-01 17:58:12 "Great Moments of Weed History" I have to listen to that episode...I mean if Jesus was anointing guys with weed oil, I'd like to know more
8738 2018-04-01 17:58:07 The only other possible rationale, although not a good one IMO, is that an oil producer will handle trim and other plant material for extraction. Again, this material is no longer being cultivated so I still see "Production License" as the appropriate label. #ACMPR

8749 2018-04-01 17:56:26 Ummm....what?

Way off the beam. Government of Canada owns and produces zero oil - they can't commit public company production.

And what refinery is that?
8750 2018-04-01 17:56:01 Yes it's curious how the views of someone who describes himself as a consumer advocate seem so aligned with the interests of major oil companies.

8752 2018-04-01 17:55:47 Maybe an example of what investigative journalist Paul Hutcheon calls  "discredited claims on secret oil fields" ? Easier to fill a Sunday Herald page attacking the "alternative facts" brigade than actually investigating ?

8761 2018-04-01 17:54:36 3) better (greener?) future, but forcing that choice, dishonestly, on others, while using other people's money to do it is just plain wrong! It's no different than raging about "fossil fuel subsidies to the oil companies" without applying any logic to the issue.
8762 2018-04-01 17:54:11 It is #antisemitism to violate the bill of rights, Jesus was king of the Jews.   Syria the only secular Arab nation who always took refugees attacked by turkey stealing their oil, is international crime, innocent people die of all faiths. Murders and rapist have no claim to faith

8777 2018-04-01 17:51:17 It's great that the airlines want to buy their fuel for Asia and America made from foreign oil and Vancouver doesn't want Transmountain, but everybody wants healthcare and welfare and pensions and transfer payments. And that doesn't work.

8784 2018-04-01 17:50:31 I guess it depends if we got to them or they came to us. If they get here in a space ship burning oil and held together by tape, I guess it means the universe is safe and forgiving. If we find them, we eat them.
8785 2018-04-01 17:50:28 When the snake oil salesman comes to town, everyone buys a bottle.

8809 2018-04-01 17:46:38 First of all an electric car is not “emission free”. Somewhere a power station is busy producing electricity out of gas, oil or coal. On average in the US 46% of the electricity is made from coal which produces the most pollutants.
8810 2018-04-01 17:46:24 I doubt if they need 'the oil' anymore
8811 2018-04-01 17:46:17 I got a sample of the Luna sleeping oil from Sephora a couple days ago..... and I’m really loving it  I hate myself for even getting a sample bc that oil cost more than my whole soul.... and it’s safe to say it’s the best oil I’ve EVER used. SO. GOOD.
8812 2018-04-01 17:46:14 Easily made back...oil and natural gas along being exported to these plagued regions states would easily replace those two nasty states....and thats just two things right off the top of my head....film makers are leaving California to cheaper states that are “right to work”..etc.
8813 2018-04-01 17:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or federal law enforcement.

8816 2018-04-01 17:45:51 There was a question that involved asking about why the show can't be shown on oil rigs, because on the DVD's, its something about like how some shows aren't allowed to be watched in certain places. It was the Hawaii Supernatural Con, Jensen and Misha panel. It's on YouTube.

8821 2018-04-01 17:45:10 In order for the use of Alberta oil to be used in BC there has to be another refinery but that out an end too because the Burnaby one is at full capacity.

8832 2018-04-01 17:43:31 Brought to you by Lukeoil and Aramco. Keeping the world safe from governments who devalue their oil for 35 years, and the Adolph Coors Foundation, getting poor people to buy beer so rich Social Darwinists can make sure you'll barely be able to afford it.

8834 2018-04-01 17:43:19 Neem oil is disgusting and my mom can not convince me that it’s good because it smells like hot dog water and oh my god I just won’t use it because it smells so bad ...don’t care about the benefits
8835 2018-04-01 17:42:59 Now we can trace a terrorist attack to Bahrain, find WMDs in Bahrain, invade the country, steal the oil, and further delay the development of clean energy sources, while lining the pockets of the already super rich.

8837 2018-04-01 17:42:47 It shouldn't even be illegal in the first place. This was a move for lobbyists in oil, timber, and pharmaceutical industries. The knew it killed cancer cells under Nixon via a UVA study they had.
8838 2018-04-01 17:42:38 @blckriflecoffee Can y'all make a coffee infused with CBD Hemp oil? That would be awesome.

8843 2018-04-01 17:42:03 Buying is much different than producing - love to have foreign cash in flow.

Except in Canada. We hate oil, foreign captial knows this and is leaving, on horseback.
8844 2018-04-01 17:41:58 Can the Bond properly be considered a ‘stunning’ success until the end of its 5 year term. Gone well so far, but could turn into snake oil.

8849 2018-04-01 17:41:06 Well considering the states education is suffering because of oil and gas, I think it goes hand in hand.
8850 2018-04-01 17:41:05 "He (the Lord) makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate bringing forth food from the earth: wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts."
8851 2018-04-01 17:40:46 Profit margins vary wildly.  

Your point that said economists prefer sales taxes because they are non distortionary is not right. 

Sales taxes distort economic activity towards high margin businesses like Apple and against low margin businesses like oil & gas for example.

8855 2018-04-01 17:40:36 Roasting them with a tiny quantity of olive oil, dried thyme, ground cumin, salt, and black pepper makes for delicious carrots, and you don't need much salt.

8861 2018-04-01 17:39:57 Mainly I am talking about the hypocrisy of treating Alberta Oil one way, and treating all the foreign oil in a completely different way.
Besides, you never know who you are talking to on twitter. You seem to be reasonable and factual, so sorry for being all over the place.
8862 2018-04-01 17:39:55 Cannabis stocks & hearing the oil is burning better health in science modern day studies of a 10,000 year old cultivated plant Vs car vape. Pack a daily dose of car vape for your low immunities before & after chemo? Major brainwashing away the cannabis culture sniffing the BBQ.
8863 2018-04-01 17:39:45 I got some hemp that is high in CBD, Was going to make CBD oil, but was reading that it works better applied topically, so  am making a salve of it now, right now in fact! Will be ready to go tomorrow!
8864 2018-04-01 17:39:35 I was a Rush fan for over twenty years until I figured out he was a snake oil salesman. He is the personification of the deep state with ties to the Bushes and the late William Casey. His show is a CIA takeover of a good portion of the radio talk show business.
8865 2018-04-01 17:39:32 Oil and gas and mining industries give way more to republicans. However, I will say that both parties are overly influenced by big money. That is why we need to overturn citizens United and get rid of the current fundraising system. I see more dems fighting for this than repubs

8903 2018-04-01 17:33:36 I believe the problem is the restriction other provinces place on Alberta's ability to transport oil to market. I also understand Canada has been adopting restrictions on free speech.

8905 2018-04-01 17:33:12 That’s why Indian Govt doesn’t allow full electric cars. No one will question it. We need to pay taxes for oil and gas. Govt needs all our money. Even Toll gates prices have been increased.

8913 2018-04-01 17:31:14 ...and to think that crude oil was avg $100 as of 2014 and now 2017 it is at $70 pb...so even if Jonathan stole the $30 diff yet delivered exchange rate at $1:N190, shows that there is a lot to be explained by CBN and NNPC of this FG.
8914 2018-04-01 17:31:07 But we now have an obligation to them, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
8915 2018-04-01 17:31:05 There are several arguments being made: A: CO2 generation, B: Tanker traffic and impact on wildlife. C: Tanker traffic and possibility of oil spill. D: Capacity limitation. E: Anything under the kitchen sink so long as it stops oil and gas. I think we are talking past each other.

8929 2018-04-01 17:29:37 What a false dichotomy you offer. I'm OK with Canada aggressively working to reduce its use of fossil fuels derived from anywhere. You do know, I hope, that that the foreign companies dominating Alberta's oil and gas industry have no intention of selling their products in Canada?

8960 2018-04-01 17:25:09 At the end of this next 2 decades, we will be living in a different world & I strongly believe oil based products will play a very strong role in it.  It’s the getting there part that is difficult & bringing everyone together.
8961 2018-04-01 17:25:00 Distractions are causing Trump to not address some very important international issues. Examples: China's construction of a naval base in the South China sea in an effort to control shipping lanes.  Both China and Russia are secretly supplying North Korea with coal/oil and more.
8962 2018-04-01 17:24:57 Do you know anyone with an engineering background who has worked with Palm Kernel Oil, Palm Oil Mill and between the age 20-45 kindly drop a comment for such person.

The SGE, the Petro-Yuan Oil for Gold contracts, and Russian and Chinese involvement in the Middle-East, and Trump presidency will break the U. S., or the bankers... The proposal to make the $ a weight of gold will be the final nail.
8972 2018-04-01 17:23:54 Then, after getting out of the shower, I warmed my coconut oil up and rubbed myself down.

8984 2018-04-01 17:23:01 Idiot ! The fuel prices never touched these levels despite crude oil being almost double of today’s prices. Never ever we had a govt as anti people and dishonest as the #ModiGovt #JumlaJibeWar
8985 2018-04-01 17:22:57 I can literally listen to @TheWallsGroup sing Resurrecting over and over. The lyrics. Their oil. My worship elevates. 
8986 2018-04-01 17:22:55 it 100% is a pyramid scheme. i cant just release oil into the ocean and say "its in motion no one can stop it!" Im still responsible for it, just like the devs who created the smart contract are.
8987 2018-04-01 17:22:55 I’m sure Trump will just find some other big oil, climate denier to come in and destroy the environment and take bribes from special interests.

8999 2018-04-01 17:21:44 This is not a simple “win” or “lose”.Although we need oil to produce meaningful products, there remains prolific waste of it in things like plastic bags, bottles and ICE vehicles;the killers of our environment. Oil waste is getting into everything.The Climate War has just begun.

9089 2018-04-01 17:08:05 With increasing natural gas production in BC they can export their own LNG to maintain provincial economy. It’s the same arrogance thinking “everyone will need AB oil and gas forever”.  Again, we all have to do everything we can to get the pipeline built but first we need to
9090 2018-04-01 17:08:00 The real problem is the mythology of “The Alberta Advantage”, you don’t have one in the first place. Not when oil is landlocked and you’re caught in the crossfire between US shale vs OPEC et al. In low WCS prices AB gov needs other revenue streams like an HST.

Youths in diaspora  mostly the unemployed graduates should standup against dis govt for a monthly allowances of 30k a month or start a nation wide protest across Nigeria. Hold d govt responsible 4 no jobs.
9099 2018-04-01 17:06:31 incidentally, this is also true of Hummingbird Cake (the one with pineapples) which apparently originated in Jamaica but hit the big time with Southern Living and I believe there was a vegetable oil advertising tie in there too

In other tax contexts persistent loss making is unchallengeable ("hobbies" or not carried on with a view to the realisation of profit). So also need to look at how losses are used (eg c/f or set-off).

9111 2018-04-01 17:05:07 Janitors (or porters, or cleaners) are so important.  If they don't do their jobs properly the 'important' people can't do theirs.  They are the oil in the machine and without them man wouldn't have reached the moon!
9112 2018-04-01 17:05:05 Sweet cheers. such a great live band. If they play RH & Snake Oil amongst the new tracks, I'll be a happy man.

9114 2018-04-01 17:04:59 What BKs this country is all the money that’s been siphoned out this country by oil co, banks & oligarchs, like your buddy tRump! Go ahead & ask him for his tax returns...that is if he’s got nothing to hide! All you tRump followers are clueless as to is really going on!

9117 2018-04-01 17:04:42 @Falguni1951 India has the highest retail prices of petrol and diesel in South Asia as taxes account for half of the pump rates. FM  has  raised excise duty nine times between Nov 2014 and Jan 2016 as global oil prices fell. He cut the tax just once.

9118 2018-04-01 17:04:13 the real issue with carrot cake is the fat! because carrot cake popularity rose mid-century when butter was expensive and/or was pushed by the vegetable oil/magazine cabal, most recipes call for oil. But it's better with butter! Try John Barricelli's recipe
9119 2018-04-01 17:04:04 well I focus alot on low porosity products because u can’t go wrong w/ making sure your hair is really moisturized and then I make sure I add oil to cap all the product I put in my hair especially cause I colored my hair ion need my hair dry.

9123 2018-04-01 17:02:50 A City fan talking about United spending is hilarious. Btw, United earned the right to spend by being the most successful club in England with the class of 92 way before the big tv money kicked in. Without your oil tycoons you’d be fighting the relegation battle in League 1.

9135 2018-04-01 17:01:32 In comparison the 2018 federal budget denotes $1.4 Billion for the environment.  This means the Canadian government spends less on the environment than the oil & gas companies.....interesting.  So by shutting down oil & gas are we actually hurting our environment?

9161 2018-04-01 16:57:26 True, facts have changed. Now, US exports oil. But strategy wise, the Gulf remains important for the Us. Most of oil and gas to China, India, S Korea and Japan comes from here.

9191 2018-04-01 16:55:24 Both Venezuela and USA have shale but the US’s shale has an API gravity of 40° while Venezuela is at 8° (the higher the API gravity the lighter and better quality the oil is) so the shale discovered might just be poor quality and worthless.

9193 2018-04-01 16:55:16 You might still, shale oil and gas costs more to extract than conventional oil. And because opec cut production to not accommodate shale, it’s too expensive to become profitable. And we still don’t know what the quality of the shale is.

9200 2018-04-01 16:54:29 it's very important to determine the international oil market price required to make the production of shale oil economically feasible. Shale oil has high extraction and production and processing costs and requires state of the art technology
9201 2018-04-01 16:54:18 Sure the oil industry needs to change. But I disagree with you that we need to fund this change. It is a free market. We need to pay our own gov bills first. @OilGasCanada Oil industry has assets in billions; use them for innovation. Already helping with orphan wells. Why?

9231 2018-04-01 16:49:38 I'd be just fine with redirecting those federal funds now being paid to subsidize oil companies and providing EI to help the fine citizens of Alberta transition to a green economy.

9246 2018-04-01 16:47:46 Modi and BJP ...is running jumla government in India. Time has come to ouster BJP .Can't imagine the rise of oil price
9247 2018-04-01 16:47:45 seems when reading about wars, oil is more often than not been an underlying reason in one way or the other, also, Churchill wasn't adverse to using chemical weapons the M device, allegedly there is/was a stock of novichok at porton down, BUT, still no proof Russia did This deed
9248 2018-04-01 16:47:44 Aweee waa sa caster oil oy hahahaha
9249 2018-04-01 16:47:07 It hasn't really changed enough to have an affect, oil is still dominating.
I personally believe that it'll still maintain its position until its last drop.
9250 2018-04-01 16:47:02 pegging the price of bitcoin to lambos isn't that much dumber then begging it to dollars...

9251 2018-04-01 16:47:01 Daylight robbery was done earlier by some people who are facing jail time. Smuggling oil could be to a staged to blame government as there are no concrete proofs. Please dont be so naive.

9269 2018-04-01 16:44:11 @kurteichenwald is the BIGGEST hypocrite on Twitter!
9270 2018-04-01 16:44:11 Right now Canada sells raw oil at a 50% discount due to being land locked. If they can sell to the world for more then you can keep oil low at home. Right now we ship products to the US for that discount and they sell it at full price with literally 0 input cost.
9271 2018-04-01 16:44:09 I remember you mentioning in a video that essential oils don’t trigger them as much.. have you tried like some kind of essential oil body spray? 
9272 2018-04-01 16:43:57 @JP_LOKSATTA @ndtv @MirrorNow @IndiaToday @TimesNow #PetrolPrice #Petrol Govt very easily hikes the salaries of MPs and oil but why does it take 10 years to consider recommendations of Pay Commissions? Where is welfare state mechanism?
9273 2018-04-01 16:43:55 @shaunking can only afford to go because people like you donate to his PAC! It’s a scam that brings him 90K/month in recurring donations. When will you people wake up to this modern snake oil salesman.

9281 2018-04-01 16:42:41 At the moment we're still innovating and soon the driver of all that progress: crude oil, will be overtaken again by better tech. We're already doing it in transport and agricultural machinery isnt ignoring that (thought its harder).
9282 2018-04-01 16:42:40 Don’t forget about @Honda @Toyota @VW and virtually every other major - all belong to the @auto_alliance.   The same alliance denying climate science and pushing to pollute more.   They’re lockstep with the auto dealers and oil industry

9393 2018-04-01 16:26:43 The emphasis of the UCP will hopefully be to decrease the debt. UCP will benefit from NDP greenwashing of the oil industry. We will even have pipeline. Then the UCP will last for another 44 years unless Albertans have the brains to vote them out. PCs tend to be poor performers.

9407 2018-04-01 16:24:16 Still I find your comparison oversimplified. A quick overview of AB revenues show Royalties from Natural Gas down from $8.9 bil/yr to $520mil/yr since 2005. In comparison royalties from conventional+oil sands is only down from $2.4 to $2.2. I am still new to #abpoli but where +

9414 2018-04-01 16:22:34 Simple ... Thanks to U.S. fracing, the price for Saudi oil ain't what is used to be. 
9415 2018-04-01 16:22:25 For now, it doesn't mean many changes. Oil is still going to trade in the US dollar, but increasingly over time, there will be more transactions ... but this may not be a game changer

9430 2018-04-01 16:20:33 This is all by design...trust me!
As our oil can neither go East nor west it has no choice but to go south & at that $25 discount. The US then blends it off with its light shale oil for the perfect bkend & sells it at WTI and/or Brent prices. All by design.
9431 2018-04-01 16:20:31 Honestly once you go to oil it is so hard to go back. Wax just tastes so much better and I notice I get more of the medical benefits because it's so much more concentrated.
9432 2018-04-01 16:20:17 Same way he always did.
With a terrible excuse.
9433 2018-04-01 16:20:17 We don't produce enough crude oil, so keep it expensive to reduced wastage. We pay foriegn currency to purchase it. Congress kept under subsidy and waste taxpayer money. If subsidised petrol/Diesel was used by poor people then it's ok. But it was mainly used by rich people.

9435 2018-04-01 16:20:05 The Pure North deal was a political decision that copied the Horne guy's upfront grant. There is no difference between the NDP and the PCs.

9441 2018-04-01 16:19:31 BC will pass on your so called benefits, maybe you can give all those benefits to Montana and run pipes through there. The biggest benefit is to the Texas oil company not Alberta or BC.

9445 2018-04-01 16:18:55 And again more revisionist history. The oil were among the worst teams in the league every year prior to the trade. ‘Gave a championship away’ is a laughable statement. It’s why this is embarrassing.
9446 2018-04-01 16:18:42 I am not the only one. Disabled community is very disappointed and some have given up on waiting for action. Billions for the oil industry and nothing for AISH? Ideologically driven decision making by Alberta Health that does not provide us with the cost benefit analysis.
9447 2018-04-01 16:18:39 And this from a President whose election promise was to work more & play less (golf) than Prez Obama. Wonder why hasn’t this ultra creative snake oil salesman thought of rebranding his property as CAMP-A-LAGO yet? That shd convince everyone he’s hard at work.

9486 2018-04-01 16:11:54 So oil permanently collapses in 10 years. Got it. You should probably let the oil companies know, since they’re still exploring and building refineries and infrastructure...they’ll appreciate the heads up.
9487 2018-04-01 16:11:47 “The bad hombre Judas murdered innocent Jesus in his sleep. That’s why Rome needed to build a wall and take all of the oil.”
9488 2018-04-01 16:11:23 That amount has gone in to people's accounts in the banks. What does it mean ? The money has gone to people's hands. The issue of petrol prices is a complicated one. In India consumption is increasing where as we don't have enough resources of oil.

9490 2018-04-01 16:11:19 Kent..we both know as Calgarians that true spring will not come until both the Federal Liberals and Notley NDP's are defeated next election. The result will be a revived Oil industry, new investors & capital projects that will result in a strong Aberta...Happy Easter!
9491 2018-04-01 16:11:17 So until a refinery is built your oil argument doesn’t really matter.

9494 2018-04-01 16:10:56 How rough of a season has it been for the Oilers?

Goaltender Cam Talbot is considering his options and considering a trade.
'Possibly pipe-fitting' he says.

'If the oil industry rebounds i'm gonna try to hook a job in McMurray.'
9495 2018-04-01 16:10:43 Lot of oils look nice. tho....but then again, it's oil. F*** that sector, so hard to make money there.

9502 2018-04-01 16:09:53 There seems to be a backlash to screaming out threats against immigrants. Political refugees have to be accommodated. Helping the countries w/dictatorial politics & systemic violence instead of countries w/oil may stem some migration. Help these people, whatever way possible....
9503 2018-04-01 16:09:50 And again what is the difference with where they get their oil from whether it’s tanker or rail or pipeline. It’s a state buying another states product then reselling. As I stated before in order to refine more product in BC another refinery has to be built.

9673 2018-04-01 15:51:39 To be honest... We Mexicans want the same... We have the lowest hand on that deal. Oil is ours, an were paying to much for gasoline we can refine by ourselves. So... Please!! Kill NAFTA!! And go fys gringos!!

9675 2018-04-01 15:51:26 So I'll presume your answer would've been 75+ because, when it occurs, profit shifting doesn't switch many years between reported profit and loss. And fact most respondents went for <25 tell us something!

9682 2018-04-01 15:50:55 I don't think that's a fair characterization. Neither sufficient nor necessary. You could have a later peak in oil with a different mix of energy sources.
9683 2018-04-01 15:50:51 Corn. For some reason the masa has been too dry. I use a lot more water and some canola oil so they are pliable. And cornstarch. A trick from the dumplings cooking I picked up. Makes any dough smooth.

9697 2018-04-01 15:48:57 Me as well.  But this time, with oil prices rising and Exxon buying up Permian land in billion dollar purchases.  I'm not risking being on the side of the tracks when the buyout happens.  I'm staying on the train.
9698 2018-04-01 15:48:53 I think 30 mins is fine. Along with the hot oil. I like the little individual ones too

9806 2018-04-01 15:37:12 They are now allowed to export refined oil products and they're using it to jack up prices here and abroad by shrinking the inventory.  Big Oil will manipulate production and offshore sales to hold prices  If allowed to sell abroad they should have a price ceiling at home.

9818 2018-04-01 15:36:14 The Norfhern Gateway makes so much sense. As a lifetime BC resident these delay, stall, deny tactics are hurting everyone in Canada. Many, many BC residents work in the oil patch and live in BC.
9819 2018-04-01 15:36:11 @Jennie_Agent99 I hope you see this before I go shopping...what kind of oil do you use for your skin? I’ve been using almond & if I recall correctly, that didn’t make your list. Thanks.

9821 2018-04-01 15:36:06 Great answer! So counting binaries misses ways of deflating profits whilst holding the pattern of 0 or 1s over the years fixed. I'm totally convinced counting false or true loss years is a poor measure and I hadn't thought of that, so thanks

Shouldnt you accept the fact that your government has failed in curbing the raising fuel prices despite falling international crude oil prices. Its crossing all time high limits. You should better act now. Hope you reply.

9914 2018-04-01 15:25:05 China has announced trading of oil in Yuan. Do not underestimate this. If successful it will long term damage the dollar significantly(>50%).

9982 2018-04-01 15:15:31 No ISIS is the result if bombing the middle East during the time of Bush Sr. In the guise of 'freeing' it's citizens. We destroyed thier country for oil and the children who survived grew up and retaliated.
9983 2018-04-01 15:15:28 I've put castor oil on my eyebrows twice this week, so the fact I don't already have Levy-esque eyebrows is annoying 
9984 2018-04-01 15:15:27 Diesel  crosses Rupees 70 in India as all time high in Indian History. Petrol prices  also higher than neighbouring

9987 2018-04-01 15:15:18 Because coastal elites look down on a group that group collectively decides to vote for the most crass of New York City grifter?  From Western NY I can see both that costal elite looks down on those a few hours away AND that Trump is snake oil salesman. WTF.

9993 2018-04-01 15:14:58 Thanks for that. 100% agree. My eyes have been opened on this working with @cuantec and now I firmly believe that Scotland could lead a bioplastic revolution keeping oil for necessity only and in the ground where possible.

10015 2018-04-01 15:12:30 I presume it’s not in the oil long enough for the heat to penetrate through the batter & chocolate. The thought of a molten creme egg interior is, well, there aren’t words
