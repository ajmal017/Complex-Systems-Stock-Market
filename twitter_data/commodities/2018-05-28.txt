80 2018-05-28 18:11:15 Tell me one thing if you understand. Will you be okay if fuel prices go down and govt increases prices of rest of the commodities to balance out... Will that be a good step? Psychologically, yes!

82 2018-05-28 17:47:56 I’m not totally convinced by your last point. But even if it’s accurate I’d rather we had the highly prized sourcing recognition for many of our our commodities. As  the much less valued generic UK brand, which allows GM and poorer quality rearing standards in other areas.

113 2018-05-28 15:04:54 I want Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom to explain why on earth Californians are becoming homeless people and many are relocating to other state because until now no rent control and housing prices are extremely high, gas prices, gas and state tax, commodities and everything.Why?
114 2018-05-28 14:59:44 We know what they campaign on, things like hope and change we know what they deliver people like Lary Summers Robert Kagan Alan Simpson, and policies like CTPA, charter schools Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act expanding PNAC wars and the Surveillance state
115 2018-05-28 14:49:57 desde quando Lula fez isso? Ele pegou uma economia relativamente estável do governo anterior e desfrutou de um momento de riqueza graças aos commodities intensamente comprados por China e cia. Lula é o "amigo" das empreiteiras.
116 2018-05-28 14:48:42 I too remember those days. Going thru the line with black and white labeled groceries and paying with paper food stamps. Also remember the commodities my Grandma got peanut butter,pork in a can and macaroni shells. We did what we had to, to survive.
117 2018-05-28 14:46:46 The prices of essential commodities are skyrocketing,due to hike in petrol prices.The government is killing common people through a burden of taxes like GST,krishi Kalyan cess ,excise duty, education cess. This government is the worst in the history of India.
118 2018-05-28 14:46:37 O preço flutua pois é uma commodities e preço é definido pelo dólar, como real desvalorizou e o petróleo aumentou, sem falar que a Petrobrás tem que recuperar o rombo feito em gestões passadas.Produzimos petroleo bruto e não refinamos na mesma proporção da produção.

120 2018-05-28 14:31:54 2/n at dirt cheap rates to their employees. That's called welfare. The Defence Forces even BUY their own Insurance and not a single naya paisa is contributed by the Govt.

126 2018-05-28 14:05:42 Lula não ajudou ninguém a comprar nada , o boom da década passada foi o boom das commodities , foi quando chineses compraram milhões de toneladas de soja e minério de ferro e inundou o país de dinheiro.Direito trabalhista é dar empregos e o ex governante em questão os extinguiu

132 2018-05-28 13:43:42 Sir with all due respect that was the case earlier, I have not seen prize hike of vegetables the way it used to be, we need to understand with gst lot of things have changed..and fuel cost increase has no direct relation now with basic commodities how it used to earlier.
133 2018-05-28 13:40:07 No. It’s not the survey nor ppl will decide. It’s the sad reality of actual #’s that u see everyday as prices of basic commodities & gas continue to go up.

144 2018-05-28 13:01:46 They think they are controlling the money supply.. Increasing the amount of money in the system can still lead to deflation. What if all the ‘money’ in the commodities market suddenly moved to the bond market? It doesn’t matter how much they print.

153 2018-05-28 12:06:29 Essa política de preço atrelado ao petróleo e dólar não funciona no Brasil por causa da desonestidade do brasileiro. Quando essas commodities sobem, eles sobem o preço, mas quando elas abaixam, eles mantem o preço e aumentam seu lucro.

155 2018-05-28 11:31:15 Centre & the state should reduce excise duty 10% each on petrol & diesel to ease consumers burden. Which will also stabilise rising prices of commodities & inflation. There is no point centre blaming states & vice Versa.

158 2018-05-28 11:21:55 Someone needs to produce the commodities you exchange for money. The people who produce those things do not get paid to the full value of their efforts, leading to profit for the employer. So I stand by my claim that the quote is wrong.
159 2018-05-28 11:17:38 Is it even correct to say “settlement of debts” in English? Strictly speaking settlement means to deliver physically (in the old days) or electronically (nowadays) securities or funds or commodities. Or at least that’s how I understand it

253 2018-05-28 00:13:30 Who have we become when we, as a country, turn our backs on these children? They are human beings not commodities. We are causing them lifelong trauma. This is a human tragedy on a massive scale.
254 2018-05-28 00:09:53 Big difference between greater, arms-length, world trade and EU single market which includes people - as if they are trade-able commodities.
