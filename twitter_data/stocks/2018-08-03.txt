47 2018-08-05 23:29:16 I watch it in stocks:  down moves trade diff from up moves. I watch it in psychology:  traders after a losing day are no mere mirror of winner.

Try it with persuasion. Someone in trouble wants something fast & big. Someone doing well wants incremental/compounding changes. 2/2
48 2018-08-05 23:28:51 Do you think of Wallstreet stocks surging with every layoff a company announces?

49 2018-08-05 23:28:29 Some people still think cryptos are a scam simply because people have lost a lot of money trying to profit from it.

58 2018-08-05 23:21:34 Almost all of the negative false media can be traced back to GEORGE SOROS. He funds foundations and owns stakes in most of them & makes more money by trading stocks based upon their actions. ARREST GEORGE SOROS !
59 2018-08-05 23:21:29 US stocks advanced on Friday as upbeat earnings helped investors shrug off heightened trade anxieties & weaker-than-expected jobs growth. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 21 points higher at 6,204.
60 2018-08-05 23:20:11 Under any economy, there will be adjustments among stocks.  But they don’t show uncertainty as much as showing shifts in focus.  After all the growth, people cashed in.  We still have had more overall growth since the election than the previous 8 years combined.
61 2018-08-05 23:19:23 No he did not. I understand your point, but get your facts straight. He had 0 machine guns. Only a few of his weapons were outfitted with bump stocks. None of his weapons were illegal, nor was he violating any laws by having them like he did.
62 2018-08-05 23:18:58 Stocks: Global stock market risk remains at positive level of 39% (last week: 30%).

67 2018-08-05 23:06:51 Informative thread. A way I've tried to combat this trap is by plotting P/B vs. P/E for a stock of interest vs. its peers, with the assumption that the undervalued stocks will fall below the industry/comp median on both metrics (if fundamentals are positive/improving). Thoughts?

124 2018-08-05 21:51:29 Markets being held hostage by this worldwide trade war the White House has put the United States into. When over, and it will be, best be long stocks. When you ask? you tell me.
125 2018-08-05 21:50:03 Riding the coattails of obama that took USA from brink of deep recession. Stocks were 8000. When he left they were 19000. Unemployment went from 9% to 4.6 %. Trump did crap
126 2018-08-05 21:47:33 He just doesn't want to tell you. Stocks will be up. Notice the candy companies. Buy their stock. Halloween and Christmas are coming. 

Shame on you, Bill.
127 2018-08-05 21:47:32 Directly own stocks meaning they could still own ETFs or mutual funds. Still pretty crazy numbers... you would think a lot own FANG stocks lol.

131 2018-08-05 21:45:34 How many posts you post, stocks markers are gonna rally higher
132 2018-08-05 21:44:22 Ahh now I get it. This means bitcoin available on all brokerage trading platforms. Incredible. Buying BTC alongside stocks.
133 2018-08-05 21:44:09 Lol people get rekt if they were to buy direct stocks dude. No way is it common.
134 2018-08-05 21:43:10 Stocks getting low now...thank GOD! lol
135 2018-08-05 21:42:28 The problem is that you can accept money from publicly traded companies that undoubtedly have some percentage of stocks owned by foreign people
136 2018-08-05 21:42:27 In addition, less than 10% of all the millennial own stocks as well.
137 2018-08-05 21:42:10 Se difunden ideas muy confusas. EEUU necesitaría financiamiento de China para realizar sus gastos. Después esto entremezcla con galimatías sobre el 'ahorro' y una horrorosa confusión de stocks con flujos. En Argentina agregan ingredientes post-CEPALinos y la ensalada está lista.

There should be consequences. Not just hand-wringing.
140 2018-08-05 21:37:41 yeah the holding B thing was bollocks but there's literally nothing wrong with homie stocks. I dunno in smash4 but in melee it's really easy to accidentally die so homie stocks are very basic etiquette that many many top players live by, mango is beloved for homie stocking

142 2018-08-05 21:35:46 I wonder what kind of lives people have that they actually get extremely argumentative with the kid who stocks cereal at the local grocery store....
143 2018-08-05 21:34:06 $SPY Major indexes continue to act quite bullish indeed, however I'm still finding recently that it's more about which stocks. Be selective.

147 2018-08-05 21:28:30 You have a much higher likelihood of finding a few stocks that will double in price, than you do buying into the next $NFLX or $AAPL. The way to make triple-digit gains year/year is by completely ignoring fundamentals & simply follow the $$$! Supply/Demand
148 2018-08-05 21:28:22 A lot of people think the most important thing in life is to have a lot of money. In my oppinion is money a tool who works only when you’re re happy. And I also like the process way more then the end goal.#money #goals #motivation #millionaire #stocks #happiness #life #process

152 2018-08-05 21:25:58 Josh Rachlis is calling in from Toronto: "I'm doing voice acting from home - I used to do AirBnb... I made money with stocks but I lost it all. Now I'm kind of down to the wire... I'm at a turning point right now. It's tough to figure out how to make money."

155 2018-08-05 21:20:32 Idk where these players are from, but homie stocks are fairly common in the east coast. It’s also a type ofpower play, saying “i don’t need your sd to win”

These are the new penny stocks
163 2018-08-05 21:07:03 I’m not arguing your point I’m just saying that had nothing to do with what I said, you want 21 SAVAGE to rap about stocks and bonds and world peace? You’re reaching lol

169 2018-08-05 21:00:16 Trickle down economics isn't real. Every bailout ever given to corporations went back into buying back stocks and not growing jobs. Every corporation not paying a living wage is taking a handout by shifting their negligence to the State for assistance to the underpaid.

171 2018-08-05 20:57:55 EVO GF of Smash 4 was disrespectful. It's a major, not a local. Two fools stalling the match and giving stocks. Literal definition of collusion. Not reading the rules isn't an excuse. The TO should've DQed both of them instantly. This is why smash is treated as a joke in the FGC.
172 2018-08-05 20:55:28 Hey @UnicornWal! J'ai peut-être raté l'info, mais quand est-ce que les stocks vont être renfloués?
173 2018-08-05 20:54:41 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $AEM, $GG, $HL, $KBH, all may climb w/in 11, 17, 10, 14 days up to 2.7%, 3%, 5.3%, 3% respectively 
174 2018-08-05 20:54:17 melee is much faster paced than smash 4 which explains why there are 4 stocks and rarely does it lead to timeouts. as for appreciating the skill, you do have to have the interest in the game to learn that 99% of the movement they do is non-standard and skill based

176 2018-08-05 20:52:45 There's a lot of potential for manipulation there - selling/buying stocks right before/after closing hours can have effects on the starkets only pros can reliably work with, and it's the same pros that'd be able to change this.
177 2018-08-05 20:52:31 You believe your own BS. They’re owned by the government. That’s communism/ socialism. It’s capitalism if the employees can benefit with profit sharing. Buying stocks. Investing  in a legitimate business with their own money without the government owning it.
178 2018-08-05 20:52:22 I’ll bet he doesn’t know squat about options trading. Bought these stocks over inflated I’ll bet he barely got a 12% return since he bought them!
179 2018-08-05 20:51:52 Pot stocks gains are doing the same 4 me!
180 2018-08-05 20:51:51 Only 100 companies is nothing to be proud of considering how many companies didn’t give their employees nothing. The bought back stocks.

There is plenty of money if we understand that 100 people own 62% of the wealth. I00 people own 2/3 of the stocks! Why do we tolerate this?
184 2018-08-05 20:45:37 Here's a scary thought for all of you stock investors out there .

How many of the premium stocks are being contoled by Russian collaboration .

197 2018-08-05 20:28:51 There is too much of noise and to spot genuine stocks is challenging!!!
198 2018-08-05 20:28:17 It's not a coincidence that trillion dollar stocks and trillion dollar deficits arrive at the same time. If one scares you and the other doesn't, you might not know what you are talking about.

My stocks have definitely done wonderfully.
JOBS: booming

Trump 2020 will happen again effortlessly
211 2018-08-05 20:15:39 Hmmm if you bought last year you would be up over 100% today.  If you bought shit coins which are like penny stocks you are down.  Many of us saw the parabolic move in Dec and exited either into tether or dollars.  We will wait for the bear to end and then enter again.
212 2018-08-05 20:13:23 My hopes are that crypto pumps while stocks and real estate dump.
213 2018-08-05 20:13:18 D’accord merci de ta réponse, juste une dernière question. Comptes-tu ravoir des stocks pour les codes ?
214 2018-08-05 20:12:55 4 Stocks was a mistake
215 2018-08-05 20:12:43 Why is melee 4 stocks
216 2018-08-05 20:12:16 It's not white liberals it's most liberals that do this. Just say fuck em and use it to make more jokes. That will now only show them but make them look like huge laughing stocks.
217 2018-08-05 20:12:13 Stocks plunged as Joy Global Inc. unveiled a industrious pair of earrings today.
218 2018-08-05 20:11:47 Obama inherited an economic disaster, you got a strong economy handed to you on silver platter. Now your policies are creating massive debt, and corporate buy back of stocks are creating a bubble that will burst like nothing since the Great Depression.
219 2018-08-05 20:10:16 To @ReformedBroker , I like your A-D observation, and I noticed that this week too.  I've been buying undervalued stocks with expected good EPS surprises like CE, CRS, ATI, KMT tomorrow, some in energy like APA, CRZO, and 2 techs AMAT and MU that no one believes can do more.
220 2018-08-05 20:09:20 It’s been a busy last two days for me and the heat has not helped. Today popped in to see a couple of householders that had been the victims of burglaries. Never nice and can be traumatic for some. If you need advice I’m always here to help.  
No, the stocks went out years ago.

229 2018-08-05 19:56:36 That is the mission I carry with me. Maybe $BTC fails, but you need to spread your eggs in different baskets. If you are fortunate to be able to invest a small amount (500-1000$), put it into Bitcoin, Gold, and High Risk-High Reward Stocks

261 2018-08-05 19:26:36 @Steven1_994 Dux, really enjoy learning from your video lessons and dvd. How do I know how much back log volume a particular stocks have? How do I gauge the volume of the stocks and the number of bagholder during the trade. How do I use volume spike and decrease to my advantage.
262 2018-08-05 19:26:33 It's pretty obvious that only conservatives are getting the qfd ban. Nothing will happen until the stocks tank and shareholders either bail or clean house.
263 2018-08-05 19:24:45 American socialism is good old public and pension institution can buy stocks while the labor/capital currency loses value for unaccountable public policies that interest is paid on to bonds/dividends for ppl that do NOTHING
264 2018-08-05 19:24:34 @RobinhoodApp While the Robinhood app allows no cost investing, the prospective user should be aware of the limitations of this site.  They do not provide ask/bid spreads and it is difficult to determine a good limit price on volatile stocks.
265 2018-08-05 19:24:31 I am so disappointed at @TwitterSupport @Twitter @jack @kayvz for shadow banning & blocking Iranian resistance accounts fighting for democracy & freedom in #Iran.

267 2018-08-05 19:23:47 Bra sammanfattning: "The study found that stocks with the highest short interest ratios, 99th percentile, underperformed on average by 125 basis points per month, or 15% per year, but ...high short interest stock with small market cap are better shorts.” (Asquith et al)

270 2018-08-05 19:21:49 Your Stocks investments are your good friends because they stay with you during good and bad phases in the market.

A friend in a need is a Stock indeed.
271 2018-08-05 19:19:48 Per IBD study of model book stocks, after leaders top, they correct an average of 72%.  Why it’s important to have sell rules in place. 
272 2018-08-05 19:17:40 Business students in next 20 years will be confused reading about the second correction of tech stocks valuations again wondering why we didn’t learn from the internet bubble of the 90s.
273 2018-08-05 19:17:18 I love technicals as one measure for evaluating commodities and stocks because it is the ultimate measure of human psychology.
274 2018-08-05 19:17:09 Pro tip: marry into a family who stocks up on Busch Light when they know you're coming over
275 2018-08-05 19:16:31 Investing in volatile stocks without ask/bid spreads is risking.  Both FB and NFLX have left investors wishing that they had the ability to place stop loss orders.  The $10 that you might spend on a low cost broker may be money well invested!

306 2018-08-05 18:51:47 By “bet against” I was talking from a “cash is trash by comparison” and “bonds are trash by comparison” point of view.    Yes, stocks have risk, but bonds and cash are trash.   :)

Si oui je vois pas comment et du coup je suis pas sur que vous ayez les gourdes @kleankanteen que je veux pour les vacances
309 2018-08-05 18:50:11 Fuck it, I'll chime in. Bayo is a cool character, unfairly hated, and frankly not appreciated. Booing/death threats for playing the character is obviously wrong. But stalling, homie stocks, and clearly antagonistic behavior towards audience... c'mon now you're gunna get flack.

No, there were no ARs, semi-automatics, bump stocks or plastic guns then.

323 2018-08-05 18:44:38 Almost all true, except for the stock market. Companies are overjoyed about tax cuts that allow them to buy back stocks and increase dividends. Too bad that doesn’t help lower income workers who don’t have a 401k or an investment portfolio!

327 2018-08-05 18:43:04 The flows have been concentrated in a narrow group of new paradigm stocks and moving out of baskets: mutual funds & ETFs. In the unloved areas of the market there are values to be found. Just don’t expect rapid gains. Patience wins.
328 2018-08-05 18:42:27 bitcoin is open 4.2x more hours per week. Therefore bitcoin markets move at least 4.2x as fast as stocks. Which corresponds with 4 year bubble cycles which match up with halvings. Based on those calc's we are at or near bottom and bull market begins in less than 6 months.
329 2018-08-05 18:41:53 Yooooo damn two stocks like that?
330 2018-08-05 18:41:02 Around with printed guns, we don't want them on our streets, we get through without them, you do you America, but when the start printing bump stocks, and other aids that make it easier for mass shooters, don't think reading the second amendment is going to comfort relatives
331 2018-08-05 18:40:09 maybe player X is practicing a low tier early in bracket against worse players, because they have an idea to pull it out as a counter pick in an important match

player X will never start a match by saying "i want 3 stocks instead of 4"

335 2018-08-05 18:37:33 Subjective maybe in casual play, but the concept of good or bad characters comes from years of testing and results, which is factual. Your number of stocks has nothing to do with how well you outplay your opponent, and as such, reverse 3/2-0s are things that exist and happen

338 2018-08-05 18:33:04 Thus money goes to fewer stocks thus prices higher
339 2018-08-05 18:32:46 Picking the worst character in the game as opposed to your best is absolutely "not trying your hardest." Four stocks with a shit character is far less impactful than three with your best. Sandbagging is literally underperforming by definition, not sure where youre coming from tbh

393 2018-08-05 17:44:19 If you're talking money, investing, credit or stocks we can be bestfriends! 
 — feeling super
394 2018-08-05 17:44:15 And also getting the sense of correction other wise too seeing the overall euphoria build up all around going for fresh longs across sector / stocks , with new life high targets for many stocks ...
395 2018-08-05 17:43:27 le blé est il si rare ? vu l'etat des stocks mondiaux non , le prix s'envole oui , on peut penser que les traders amplifient la hausse , ce qui n'est pas grave puisqu'ils peuvent aussi gagner de l'argent à la baisse
396 2018-08-05 17:43:09 KENYANS decry Chinese use of illegal fishing nets that are dwindling fish stocks in Kenyan lakes. #sundaylive
397 2018-08-05 17:41:37 Latch up Pvt bank stocks 
398 2018-08-05 17:40:04 The first 3 episodes of #TheSecretLifeofJeffreeStar already has me crying, I K N O W @JeffreeStar and @shanedawson are about to have me owning stocks in Kleenex over the next 2.
399 2018-08-05 17:39:14 Bots gonna eat up all the stocks anyways
400 2018-08-05 17:39:08 Yes for #1 Buffett invests in operating businesses that throw off free cash .
For #2 he wisely deploys these cash flows  in carefully selected stocks.
401 2018-08-05 17:38:13 Aaaah the joy of cake induced coma here, no greater love hath a mother to her offspring. Cupboards getting cleared cake by cake. On inspecting stocks I see there will be many cakes of the polenta variety, all recipes gratefully received.......
402 2018-08-05 17:37:50 and then we have Ross over there making sure his stocks are profiting from his policies. Oh & then there's Munichen (however you spell) trying to bypass Congress & award those same top 1% billions more in taxes!! Trump brought in creatures the swamp was to dignified to claim!
403 2018-08-05 17:37:03 imagine if Melee GF in its prime time Sunday slot featured two Foxes lasering each other to 300% and giving out homie stocks
404 2018-08-05 17:36:38 I haven't seen #DonaldTrump name or identify the location of these new steel  
plants, as repeatedly requested here yesterday.

Perhaps they are merely hidden by massive stocks of clean coal.
405 2018-08-05 17:36:28 Barring that, I'd like to see him wheeled out of the Oval on a dolly in handcuffs, leg cuffs, that mask Hannibal Lector wore, and a straight jacket.

Also, can we bring back the stocks and put him in that so everyone can walk by and throw fruits and veggies at his Treason Face?
406 2018-08-05 17:35:56 Ig idk it’s not like giving homie stocks is a super common thing it couldn’t hurt to keep them around if you want to do it you should be able to
407 2018-08-05 17:35:50 Major cover up going on here.
Tapes were analyzed by experts proving at least 2 sources of automatic gunfire.  Bump stocks also can NOT shoot rapidly and accurately at the same time
408 2018-08-05 17:34:43 nah lima was giving homie stocks in grands
409 2018-08-05 17:33:47 Or good lord the ups and downs I've had.  My #1 rule I ever leaned about stocks is do not fall in love with anything.  Date them don't marry them.
410 2018-08-05 17:33:33 Are doing nothing about DACA. Military is now blaming the Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.
411 2018-08-05 17:32:12 Their stocks were worth $0.06... I’m pretty sure I could open a dog walking service and be publicly traded for more than that in a week.
412 2018-08-05 17:31:17 We do have to protect our environment & fish stocks but the level of punishments for the 2 topics I compared above are nowhere near fair.  If the government wanted to they could ruin your life for a fish.  Breaking federal laws?  Not so much.  Have a great day 
413 2018-08-05 17:30:52 Don’t understand how people go out every weekend. Go better yourself, save that money you blow on drinks and invest in stocks, buy a new car, travel around the world, grow up. Shit is corny.
414 2018-08-05 17:30:51 Say what you will about the stall charging, but I refuse to believe homie stocks are unsportsmanlike. Both players worked super hard to get where they are. 

Think of the golden rule. If I lost EVO GFs due to a *fluke*, I’d be more than a little ticked, and Lima knows that too
415 2018-08-05 17:29:17 Heavily shorted stocks spike when the broader markets decline due to L/S funds covering to meet margin calls.
416 2018-08-05 17:29:04 may stocks ka pa nito? anong brand ba binebenta mo? genuine na yan?
417 2018-08-05 17:28:53 Submit Ur Cv in my DM for consideration. Offer Valid while stocks last
418 2018-08-05 17:28:21 I haven’t seen any dishonesty from Sykes. I’d call him the real deal as well for stocks. Just know you need about 2k minimum account size to short with most brokers for stocks, and his strategy is short biased. This is why I started with FX, lack of funds and small account.
419 2018-08-05 17:28:09 I have 100 stocks and bought 1 year before. Should I hold it or sell ?
420 2018-08-05 17:25:58 Apples already $1 trillion. I'd RATHER buy a pair of jordans, deadstock or collectible, thats how you flip $200 for $700-2k. Better than an apple stock. Then buy 10 more shoes, after, 50 apple stocks
421 2018-08-05 17:25:55 Personally, I could do without much of his petty tweeting.
422 2018-08-05 17:25:37 Will the thing u and rock are working on bring any value to traders trading in large and mega cap stocks?
423 2018-08-05 17:25:26 True.  In long term investing, one's success goes up, the moment one starts to look for stocks from ROE, rather than PE.
424 2018-08-05 17:24:31 "Either way, you wear it well, Stocks. Gotta say, your legs are the most eye catching part for me."

426 2018-08-05 17:22:10 @tradingwitheli Hi there! I am a professional trader of 12 years. I use to trade stocks and options but now I trade fx exclusively. I trade price action exceptionally and freely offer myself to bounce ideas around about the market and would love to make a new friend! Message me!
427 2018-08-05 17:20:53 You’re right, he’s the PRESIDENT OF THE USA. He should engage in petty twitter wars with all the ppl who do not like him. That’s correct use of his time and power.  That’ll show the rest of the world how powerful we are!
428 2018-08-05 17:20:01 First ever visit to @edfringe ... 

@aaron_calvert show last night was fantastic 

Our kids were in awe (as were the adults tbf).
429 2018-08-05 17:19:48 I mean homie stocks are nice because then it’s more of a who’s a better player than oops I messed up guess I’m screwed for this game
430 2018-08-05 17:19:21 you are right. it aludes to a temporary rise in the failling stocks of the companies mentioned.

433 2018-08-05 17:18:03 Got my mfn stocks vesting im too hype 
434 2018-08-05 17:17:59 Buti nalang talaga may stocks si mama ng pagkain
435 2018-08-05 17:17:15 Once the Stocks scythe falls there’s only one outcome #100%record
436 2018-08-05 17:16:46 Screen using Finviz with paramaters -- up over 50 cents, over 1 million vol and up over 10 % on the week for possible swing trades. That usually gives me 5-10 names/day. Sept.-April most active. Mainly momo stocks <$20.
437 2018-08-05 17:16:29 If both players intentionally not approaching is grounds for DQ due to collusion, I vote that we also DQ players who give 'homie stocks' as well.
438 2018-08-05 17:13:22 President of the United States deserves to be held to a higher standard and we must hold every POTUS to high standards. Trump supporters have eroded those standards because there was no choice.
439 2018-08-05 17:13:21 I've never been able to figure out options trading.
Where do you have more success? Stocks or options?
440 2018-08-05 17:12:32 26 states have pass gun control laws in <5 months. bump stocks banned in 8 states & counting. ~ 250K voters registered by gun control groups.  I think if there had been more push than #March4Lives, you'd already have had your guns taken away.
441 2018-08-05 17:11:21 These stocks need to best seen on. Adcf basis. Extremely high growth round the corner
442 2018-08-05 17:11:16 This is why Twitter stocks plummet. Keep it up @jack
443 2018-08-05 17:10:55 it is time to sell apple stocks. competition is so high now no tech company can make huge profit
444 2018-08-05 17:10:03 Excellent observation, San bro...just checking on BN as well where it often fails...but fairly accurate for Nifty...may be applicable for Nifty 50 high beta stocks...
445 2018-08-05 17:09:46 Who knows about stocks & can teach me the basics about them? 
446 2018-08-05 17:09:27 He seems obsessed about stocks for a man who has said more than once he thought TSLA was overvalued and lamented his need to tap public markets for capital. The only reason I can think of for why he's so weird about short sellers is that he's trying to protect his own net worth.
447 2018-08-05 17:07:39 The tourist information centre stocks them, now open Saturdays too.
448 2018-08-05 17:07:22 Some stocks you might want to add to your portfolio ASAP - $MGON, $LVCA, $PAOG, $RBIZ, $MCGI
449 2018-08-05 17:05:44 @jack must be racist towards whites. He protects only #Democraps and trashes conservatives. This liberally biased site is getting more and more pathetic. I sincerely hope the gov steps on him hard. Stocks already tanking.

451 2018-08-05 17:03:23 I’m in the process of researching the most efficient ways to decrease debt and all I have to say is I wish they’d teach you this real life stuff in school. Along with taxes, retirement info, stocks, etc.
452 2018-08-05 17:01:17 Because putting him in the stocks doesn’t address the institution where these views are clearly tolerated, if not actively encouraged.
453 2018-08-05 17:01:15 i don’t want no rapping ass nigga give me a nigga that’s into stocks & got businesses 
454 2018-08-05 17:00:32 Think about the Warriors right now if their minimum players would be paid thru "stocks." A minimum amount of stocks for the Warriors would be a hell of a lot more than for any other team, presumably. Many vets already flock to them, but now they'd be able to cash in too
455 2018-08-05 17:00:23 Does anyone here use bpi trade for stocks? Hahaha dm pls
456 2018-08-05 16:59:42 $fnko all day. Also buy the cereal. Stocks up 100% in last year. Yum
457 2018-08-05 16:59:15 #thewomensguidetosuccessfulinvesting The number of women aged 18-34 years old who own stocks declined from 49% in 2001-2007 to 36% in 2008-2018.  Ladies,  we need to educate our young women on how to invest for their future!
458 2018-08-05 16:58:57 Starting an IRA & getting in to stocks will be the best move for me & my girl, we really tryna boss up & build a nice portfolio. Take notes 
459 2018-08-05 16:58:47 What would happen to the prices of stocks, housing, gold, oil, etc., if currencies ever became asset backed (gold & oil)?

463 2018-08-05 16:57:10 Out of everything people are mad at in that grands how are some people mad at the homie stock. Homie stocks are honorable and keep the match from having a obvious winner
464 2018-08-05 16:55:48 That's why I play smash wit items and 4 people wit 99 stocks on big blue.
465 2018-08-05 16:54:24 For me, to be honest, as I'm learning I struggle with hearing the platitudes of "Follow your plan" and other sayings of the like. As I sit here reading and trying to learn "How to make money in stocks" and "Trade like a stock market wizard" I'm grasping the concepts, but don't...
466 2018-08-05 16:54:11 Compared to this my pf is down 5% on the YTD with stocks making up 35% of pf profitable! I think I have reason to cheer. 
467 2018-08-05 16:54:05 average dream on meds: i file a brokerage application after researching stocks. i catch a mistake at the last minute before submitting.

468 2018-08-05 16:52:42 @TwitterSupport @Jack You people are shameless. Stocks are dropping like a rock. Congress wants to investigate. Hey big government right!? Perhaps some heavy sensirship and regulations will be in order
469 2018-08-05 16:51:47 That would probably make the most of the stocks. Speaking of Ektachrome, you seen that beta test are currently out
470 2018-08-05 16:49:39 Very few countries can boast themselves as India, as far as Stock market is concern apart from few hiccups (always the case with stocks)we are amongst the most mature markets. Yet, people are always pessimistic...
471 2018-08-05 16:49:28 A busy week for blue chip stocks and FANG stock earnings reports starts slow early Monday, but picks up after the close when Google parent
472 2018-08-05 16:49:27 Was there evidence available to suggest that screens like these were the way to go 20 years ago? And why are there so few small cap ETFs with quality screens? Ok, there's the S&P 600 ETFs, which may be good enough. But there are none for ex-US stocks AFAIK.
473 2018-08-05 16:49:06 Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) led the early gains among Dow stocks. Hasbro and Mattel posted the S&P 500's strongest moves.

475 2018-08-05 16:48:43 @bigmoneymike, i got my money the honest way, not by scamming people like you do. You got a few minions who claim you make them money but the money you make you stole from many other shareholders of your pumped stocks. You would be nothing without your minions. Youre days r #d
476 2018-08-05 16:47:41 But the selling off of FAANG stocks was suppose to crash the market?   :)

481 2018-08-05 16:40:18 There are no stocks. It’s not a publicly traded company.
482 2018-08-05 16:39:48 The price of shares for private prisons stocks skyrocketed the day after the election.

483 2018-08-05 16:39:28 You jelly? Haha maybe he invests in stocks
484 2018-08-05 16:39:20 Including the furnace controller which was right next to the ladder I was working on. The bang was quite spectacular.

Took about three Radio Shacks' stocks of MOVs and appliance fuses to put everything right.
485 2018-08-05 16:38:55 Aspects of black culture gets whitewashed because we have a self destructive culture. Hyper masculinity and this need to be hard is what holds us back. Stop worrying about licks and “gang shit” invest in some fucking stocks. Teach your kids to be whatever they want to be.
486 2018-08-05 16:38:39 even if he wore sackcloth, scourged himself, allowed himself to be put in stocks and pelted with fruit after resigning as leader some of them still wouldn't be satisfied. In some respects I worry for Jc's safety. All these heated arguments might make someone do something stupid
487 2018-08-05 16:38:07 This is THE fgc tournament. People have burst into tears for getting top 8 at EVO. Theyre timer stalling in grands and giving homie stocks. Not a good look for smash 4's final time at evo.
488 2018-08-05 16:37:52 I’m Trynna invest in some stocks and shit
489 2018-08-05 16:35:37 I would say Mercantox or Stocks Exchange - I've used both in the past, no complaints to be honest

493 2018-08-05 16:31:56 The stock market is not really helping the average American. Many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, & some working two jobs: unemployment rate doesn’t show that most jobs are low paying jobs and with flat wages. Stock market up artificially by a few stocks, & stock buybacks.
494 2018-08-05 16:31:32 You're delusional. bet nothing changed in your life and still believe this bs. Bser in chiefconned you, the gullible, and got most of the money. Gave you peanuts in stocks value that will crash after the bubble bursts. Same old story...repugs for you and we come to the rescue

I dont trade as much premarket anymore, but if the setup is really good premarket I will take the trade. I only trade stocks premarket that fits my strategy. Gappers with the right setup, high volume and news
502 2018-08-05 16:28:26 I’m saying nothing...fish free zone
503 2018-08-05 16:27:28 You people who actually believe he is doing this for the common man, are idiots! This buck a beer bs is so breweries can sell off unsold stocks for less than the mandated provincial price. Again, this is for the owners/shareholders. Question everything, never take face value!
504 2018-08-05 16:26:22 if bighit is worth $57 mil USD not 1 bil and that money obviously doesn’t go directly to the artist. a big chunk is probably stocks but each member of bts does have a decent net worth so they’re making bank
505 2018-08-05 16:24:26 This argument baffles me. Yeah we only use cars 10% of the time, but it’s usually at the same times. Are we gonna have constant surge pricing at 9 and 5, or will rise shares keep immense stocks of cars?
506 2018-08-05 16:23:14 The universe planned it for me (but also it's just weird because Sephora usually stocks everything Mecca does, so Sephora now only has claim to a few of the brands it does here)
507 2018-08-05 16:23:10 I'm a wealthy business owner, entrepreneur and I primarily stick to index stocks. To fo otherwise is to treat your portfolio like a casino. I own homes here in Long Island, NY and Atlanta, GA. You seem to be making assumptions about me. Why is that?
508 2018-08-05 16:22:59 Wages r up 2.7% y/y. The PCE deflators r broadly misleading & impact ppl differently in diff parts of country based on purchases. Orig post was abt housing. Housing will b strong in next 12 months & stocks will dbl over next 5 yrs. Good luck w ur bearish bets. I’ll stay bullish.
509 2018-08-05 16:20:20 I always BUY stocks which CLSA recommends with a sell rating and SELL stocks which motilal oswal comes with a buy research report :)
510 2018-08-05 16:18:13 Use zerodha sentinel, just place breakout price, whenever price hits your level you will get alert. You can set breakout level on more than 100 stocks
511 2018-08-05 16:18:11 It is interesting to note that major market downturns seem to be preceded by a significant "positive" milestone such as the trillion $ Apple valuation, the 250 p/e for Yahoo before the dot-com crash and the 100 p/e for Polaroid in an earlier time. #stocks #markets #equities
512 2018-08-05 16:18:00 Honestly Jim, Do you really need for ALL American people??!
Then why we never hear you say ANYTHING positive about @POTUS ?
Do you even follow the news?! Economy? Stocks? Job reports? Veterans? Unemployment rates?......

Just asking.
513 2018-08-05 16:15:47 It's the same here in Finland. As far as I know, the only (only!) store in the whole country which stocks romance in English is in Helsinki and alas, I don't live there
514 2018-08-05 16:15:00 Also the increased interest income to the non government becomes more helpful to stocks over time as does the fact that specs seem better hedged these days
515 2018-08-05 16:12:47 I haven't tried it, who stocks it in the UK please Tim? 
516 2018-08-05 16:12:23 I did thank you. 
517 2018-08-05 16:11:25 I'm pro 2A but I believe bump stocks should go. They try to get around laws on the book banning automatic rifles. Having said that...if you know anything about guns (don't think so) you would know what was fired was automatic fire. Not the story presented.
518 2018-08-05 16:11:22 Millennials are killing stocks ... it's because they spend all their money on patterned socks. They're killing the industry. #avocadotoast #millennials

521 2018-08-05 16:07:55 I am an Air Force Vet who has studied technical analysis and fundamentals in stocks.

523 2018-08-05 16:05:28 smh if it feels good to you to win off someone messing up then that says more about you than someone who homie stocks... like surprisingly people want to win with honor not just win no matter the cost.
524 2018-08-05 16:05:20 i want to arrange stocks now and pack orders while im in the mood... but also im sleepy and hungry aaaaaaa
525 2018-08-05 16:04:16 これ意外とみんな知らない裏ワザなんだけど、じょしおちっ！を見なければ月曜日は来ないよ
526 2018-08-05 16:01:39 2016 was happening ?
527 2018-08-05 16:00:36 Will someome troll Elon Musk hard enough to get Tesla share prices to go back down so the stocks I shorted on the VSE will go back down?
528 2018-08-05 15:59:27 I didn't mean to him. Their spending against regulation of bump stocks and trigger cranks helped make this possible.
529 2018-08-05 15:58:45 Bout to stick to stocks and sell this crypto once it hits again
530 2018-08-05 15:57:54 Not a good idea in my opinion.  GOA doesn't compromise on anything.  The NRA kinda threw bump stocks under the bus.  That tells me that they probably aren't going to make any pushes on the NFA.  We've heard talk about deregulating sound suppressors and national reciprocity for...
531 2018-08-05 15:56:21 Sportsmanship is good yes, but if you lost the tournament and serious money out of pity, who does a sponsor really want then lol

I respect the hell out of homie stocks, but Dabuz isn't wrong at all to be tilted 
532 2018-08-05 15:54:49 On the look out for a shop that stocks a bottle of a finest vintage Lambrini.
533 2018-08-05 15:54:45 I hope I have a stocks stamp on my hand at my wedding
534 2018-08-05 15:53:59 What's especially unique is how many "crowded" stocks continue to go up. I don't remember a time where the obvious trades continue to work so seamlessly. Been doing this since '96, so I've seen my share of market variations
535 2018-08-05 15:53:55 Why is it you all can only talk about hate and racism? Why don’t you talk about facts like lower taxes, more jobs, low unemployment, rising stocks, talking with countries that have been our enemies for decades!!! I think most people know where the hate is coming from.
536 2018-08-05 15:52:54 unless you rlly can’t afford it now i suggest getting it now bc it’s limited and i’ve heard stocks are running low as it is already so
537 2018-08-05 15:52:00 A breakout with above average volume is much less likely to fail. $STUDY #stocks #swingtrading #profits
538 2018-08-05 15:50:41 Example plenty specially recently experience with pharmaceutical stocks people were fearful for last 2 years and for fundamental guy it may be bargain but as a technical guy still its not showing any big move coming just lupin that too for last 1 week
539 2018-08-05 15:47:34 My MOST favourite lippy is the lip stain  it can last a whole day for me! If you love a lip stain this CORAL is half price at the min...while stocks last  I’ll pop the link in the comments  
540 2018-08-05 15:47:26 In my opinion stocks to watch out for tomorrow & the coming week are- #AdaniPort #Arvind #VinatiOrganics #CaplinPoint #Graphite #BajajElectrical #GSFC & #DRL all on buy side.
541 2018-08-05 15:46:28 And why the 15,000 fine and jail are offensive to people trying to protect what's left of our salmon stocks?
542 2018-08-05 15:46:11 “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
543 2018-08-05 15:45:08 Maybe the USA should start with worrying about AR15’s and assault weapons/ bump stocks before they do nothing about drones.
544 2018-08-05 15:44:25 @sainsburys do u have the caramelised onion shroomdogs in stock at your Gloucester store? 
I’m also trying to find where stocks the daiya foods cheesecake?
545 2018-08-05 15:43:58 Btw anyone knows how to register for Maybank stocks account? I checked online, got nothing. Last resort before pergi je counter tanya

548 2018-08-05 15:41:25 My take on Evo 2018 grand finals for sm4sh (despite not actually watching it):
Who cares about homie stocks, that's nothing.
Stalling for a few min is problematic for reasons.
Idk why sm4sh players are worried about outsiders taking them seriously, not many of them did lol.
549 2018-08-05 15:41:24 @OrrinHatch He who smelt it, dealt it. What a shameless, duplicitous liar you are. You truly belong in government. Or the stocks in the town square.
550 2018-08-05 15:41:14 Hahahaa di nila tinuturo stocks sa school. Dm kita
551 2018-08-05 15:40:46 Also, the stock market is no longer a driver of middle class wealth. Stocks are hoarded by a smaller number of super wealthy investors. I wouldn't want an IPO of I knew Warren Buffett was there to buy most of my company.
552 2018-08-05 15:39:31 This whole time they been talking about IPA or APA I thought it was credit or stocks. They talking about beer.
553 2018-08-05 15:38:19 Can anyone suggest a curriculum to use with my high school seniors that involves: savings & checking accts, credit cards, taxes, loans, insurance, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, employment, paying for college, finding a job, retirement, etc? Thanks!
554 2018-08-05 15:38:10 @finnovationz555 Sir, I would like to know how to find small and micro stocks ....plzz make a video on it #askfinnovationz
555 2018-08-05 15:38:07 There are many sell reports on other counters as well but stocks outperforming. Getting right 1/10th time  is nothing abnormal .
556 2018-08-05 15:37:18 Best to avoid shorting day 1 stocks? Does it depend on the news vs no news? Would you recommend to wait for day 2's or 3's to short allowing the daily chart to become overextended and ultimately looking for the parabolic short setup leading up to a stuff move intraday?
557 2018-08-05 15:37:02 She forgot to add: Don’t get married, don’t have kids, don’t buy a house. The investment advice wasn’t good either. Large-cap growth funds and individual stocks is where your money needs to be. Index funds are for beginners.
558 2018-08-05 15:36:31 My brother Buster is talking to his wife about buying stocks.
Meanwhile, I'm here googling how long can someone survive on a bowl of rice a day working a 14-hour shift on a sugarcane harvesting gulag. For, uh, a friend's science project.

560 2018-08-05 15:35:35 I think the volatility of the game is the worst part considering there’s only two stocks. Sure bayo takes stocks early but so can literally almost every character, and they’re all bad for a game with two stocks
561 2018-08-05 15:35:34 Just like stocks do man, its not the best metaphor.

564 2018-08-05 15:29:33 Aguero Stocks to go up
565 2018-08-05 15:28:14 I mean the hate. The company stocks dropping. The cancellation of promotions. Y'all ship folks and then dispatch snoops and they get caught and end up having negative career implications. Leave BTS alone and stop shipping them with folks. It's none of our business.
566 2018-08-05 15:27:10 With RSI divergence and nifty pharma facing resistance, pharma stocks can be candidates to short.

569 2018-08-05 15:24:00 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @VP @PoppyHarlowCNN @CarolHLN @ananavarro  OUR Kids need to keep up the demonstrations and fight against NRA and gun supporters vs plastic undetectable 3D guns and bump stocks already illegal to convert a semi auto rifle to fully auto or machine gun !

574 2018-08-05 15:21:16 It is fascinating....when she was visiting the White House in 2014 she wasn't a spy. She only became a spy when President Trump got elected. Border patrol agents doing their jobs was OK until Trump got elected. Semi-auto rifles and bump stocks were OK until Trump got elected.....

Back to the drawing board..!!
Here's a novel idea - why don't you entertain the notion of Employer-paid Family Leave. Afterall businesses got a monster tax cut. Spend that in stead of buying back stocks and affording key execs humongous bonusses..!!
576 2018-08-05 15:16:18 Stocks are up, unemployment is at an all time low for all races and genders, GDP above 4, jobs are up, ISIS is on the run just to name a few
577 2018-08-05 15:15:27 Voting is essential for victory, but it is not the only thing we can do. We can boycott non-essential products, withdraw our money from the banks, sell off our stocks, and flood the streets. Let the GOP donors know that this country won't function until the Trump regime is gone.
578 2018-08-05 15:13:28 The guy who stocks the cheese at the grocery store just published his 1st paper in osteoarcheology! He's hoping this earns him an assistanceship in his PhD program. I hope so too! 
579 2018-08-05 15:12:59 @longhorncapital Hey Nick, do you by chance have a recommended screener for ASX stocks? Since I'm US based, preferably something that does not require opening up a trading account in Australia. Many thanks in advance!
580 2018-08-05 15:11:56 Yet another lie.  Trump has increased the national deficit, and because of the tariffs, consumers will be paying more.  Additionally, stocks of highly regarded companies have taken a dive!
581 2018-08-05 15:10:42 In all honesty, if all these channels would take 10/15 minutes out of their hour shows and go over how the stocks are up, unemployment at all time low, GDP is up, among other good things then talk about his down falls, then maybe they wouldn't be fake

@BBCWorld @AP @Reuters Trump bragging to the world he is the reason China STOCKS dropped  27%. They will come crawling to him. Will as Canada and Mexico. His Tarriff's will win!
585 2018-08-05 15:08:45 Wrong.  They're policies and I uncertainty drove ALL investment out.  All oilsands stocks trading at a discount to earnings.  The policy and lack of pipeline capacity killed the golden goose.  Only new capital projects are in Saskatchewan destined for Lloyd facility.
586 2018-08-05 15:08:28 I’ve seen many homie stocks in smash 4 and melee. Are those all collisions? Should those people all be arrested?
587 2018-08-05 15:07:32 @gracefillips Hi Grace. We have an up to 70% sale on at the moment! Only while stocks last though! Keep your eyes peeled on our home page for any other offers coming up
588 2018-08-05 15:07:02 Things may be looking up for you. I'm a mid-income(new poor)American. I do not own stocks&I don't see an increase in my pay re: trumps tax cuts for the rich. What I do see is an increase in my healthcare premiums. The economy is about the same as it was for Obama.
589 2018-08-05 15:05:41 Then ur gonna have a bad time watching ultimate. Explosive stocks and fast gameplay is one of the selling points of that game based off the demo and that’s exactly why Bayo is good in smash 4. Sorry to have to break it to you man
590 2018-08-05 15:04:35 Long only, with the occasional inverse index ETF for hedging. I don’t short individual stocks.
591 2018-08-05 15:02:56 Just shove some money into stocks for this #GorkaPositioningSystem at least
592 2018-08-05 15:01:49 Hi @galgitron  love the article. Just a curiosity you said is impossible for xrp to create 150,000 millionaires if it goes to the 589. To me i dont see a price of $589 eoy but in this article in the US last year created 700,000 millionaires. Yes is stocks and house equity.
593 2018-08-05 15:01:02 We have split the ETFs out into a smaller, easier to use app.  This means beginner investors can get their heads around investing in ETFs before taking the plunge and investing in stocks. #ETF #etfs

Hi! So my con weeks just ended. I'm in the middle of packing and counting stocks now, and I'll have school at Tuesday to Saturday, so all shipments will occur on Mondays. I'll have to divide orders by items for most ran out of stock during con (THREAD BELOW)
597 2018-08-05 14:57:07 there is a "carry" strategy I love investing in on most shorted stocks:

long the stock + short it via synthetic forward + lend out the stock to cash in the lending rate

this is risk free strategy

if funding rate < stock lending rate, then borrow money to play the carry trade
598 2018-08-05 14:56:55 Only working with blue chip stocks now 
599 2018-08-05 14:54:28 I would be curious to see how many investors with 1-2 years to go b4 child's college starts are 100% in stocks? Upside vs downside potential of mkt!
600 2018-08-05 14:53:16 10% of US households ar shareholders of 84% of market stocks-that's big win for 10% of US families. $436.6B of stocks bought back during 2nd quarter. That would've paid for $1,000 bonus checks to 6.8 million workers EVERY SINGLE TRADING DAY in the quarter. Real increase for rich.
601 2018-08-05 14:53:11 I would guess IBD calling Uptrend Under Pressure was based on Nasdaq's 50day break & bad action of growth stocks. It wasn't a distribution day. Index positive reversal and reclaiming its 21day EMA (Market School buy signal) + better action of growth stocks changed their view.
602 2018-08-05 14:53:09 Wine, tequila... Fuckin right!!! It's only right to do it!!! You got company stocks yet??? Or are they still private??? We want in...
603 2018-08-05 14:51:25 In the last posting, the FANG stocks were analyzed. Here is a projection for the second tier of such equities.
604 2018-08-05 14:49:28 Some trust in chariots some trust in horses some trust in stocks and some trust in bonds some trust in abilities and some trust in jobs
605 2018-08-05 14:48:25 You mean the stocks?
606 2018-08-05 14:47:06 There are ways to do this.  A Roth IRA at Vanguard for example lets you do it with very little money...  You can trade public stocks with as little as $100 with some of these other companies.  I do understand about investing in startups and that was supposed to be fixed but isn't

611 2018-08-05 14:44:50 Buying energy drinks with these wonky taxes is like buying stocks. Different price every time I look
612 2018-08-05 14:43:18 I have an idea, how about let people voice their opinions without judgement. Your current policies are only used to attack specific voices and are in no way applied universally. That’s why your not trusted. That’s why your stocks will fall and that’s why people will leave.
613 2018-08-05 14:41:46 I recheckrd that there are other stocks as well whose standalone PE is below 10... but consolidated is way high and still i got the same in  screener with PE< 10.
614 2018-08-05 14:40:52 Maybe you should focus on going long low float (less than 3M float) stocks on day 1 after 11am if it is above vwap. We have had many squeezers this year. Shorting pigs is what works for me, but not for you! Everyone is different
615 2018-08-05 14:37:45 And makes our community look like garbage. 

The stalling and homie stocks while I don't think we're anything other than retaliation, could easily be seen as collusion play, and also makes us look bad. 

It's not a good situation all around.

626 2018-08-05 14:28:36 But it’s not like that’s unique. I can fish through so many instances of “single bad situation to death” for her. Nietono barely even had two stocks his entire top 8 vs. the Bayos. That is broken.
627 2018-08-05 14:28:04 Well there’s one way to look at it. Do you buy something you’ve already paid for with your tax dollars or something you’ll pay for with your hard earn money? GM stocks weren’t poop government sold what stocks they owned and lost money. Lol
628 2018-08-05 14:27:14 It’s never as bad as it seems. Dividends continue to be paid by most companies during market declines, so cash-flow from stocks is only marginally disrupted. Even in bad bear markets such as 2008-9, dividends declined far less than stock prices.

636 2018-08-05 14:18:39 Twitter is going to be one of the 1st 10 companies to get to Trillion $ valuation.

The reason is simple, middleman is gone & we get our news direct from the source!

Amazon is likely 2nd Trillion $ co after Apple!

That reality makes Twitter among the best stocks right now!

646 2018-08-05 14:07:45 No, I’m referencing how often he times people out anyway with just 2 stocks.
647 2018-08-05 14:07:24 Until they stop propping stocks and bonds. Then there is no more problem from shrinking.  Only problem is the that there is no more those markets 
648 2018-08-05 14:07:14 I dont risk it on size of account. I risk based on the play. But what you should do is tell yourself WHAT IS THE MAX IM WILLING TO LOSE ON THIS TRADE and scale accordingly to that. My starter size can be 5k 10k 20k shares on different stocks. Its all based on the play
649 2018-08-05 14:07:08 I'd sell AAPL and TSLA if they were losing stocks just like I sold DRGN ICO lol.  I'll re-enter when the time is right.  A phone or a car confer real value (I can drive; phone people). A token does not offer me any practical value.
650 2018-08-05 14:06:33 Ever since I watched Overwatch league with my son I've been dd'ing all esports related stocks. My top 3 right now for lt growth over next 5 years are no surprise. $ATVI $EA $LOGI but all had big runs over past year. I'll be stalking entries but all need weekly chart consolidation
651 2018-08-05 14:05:39 I know many people trade 3-8 stocks a day, but im the type of guy to hyper focus on ONE stock a day. Size into it and make my money there rather than scalps on everything. What works for me might not work for u but thats what I do

656 2018-08-05 14:02:12 Yeah you do realize you have the ability to sell stocks when they appreciate right? Your 401k mutual funds are constantly buying and selling stocks as the market prices rise.
657 2018-08-05 14:01:35 Twitter: the sky is falling

Reality: 60%  don’t have $1,000 in savings, 80% of new income goes directly to 400 shareholders who own 2/3 of all stocks, climate change, presidents a con man his opponent rigged her election and no one cares cause Russia BS. And there’s plenty more

661 2018-08-05 13:56:19 80% of baby boomers, 75% GenX and 52% of millennials have their retirement through 401k plans, most of which is invested in stocks. So it kinda does represent the nations wealth.

663 2018-08-05 13:55:07 People lost money, and it was due to bad advice.
Your investments in stocks should be a percentage of you networth. But the brokers then didn't,pass this information across.
They sold stocks to Onitsha business men as goods,you can buy today and sell in 2 weeks time with profit.
664 2018-08-05 13:54:48 Are you selling your iPhone when the Apple stocks go down? Do you sell your Tesla when @elonmusk becomes a victim of more fake news? I think not. So why should we sell our tokenized micro-licenses when crypto is temporarily down?  #dragonchain $DRGN

669 2018-08-05 13:52:22 Why? Do investors want the inflated dividend yields of some of these stocks (KHC, KMB, GIS...etc)?
670 2018-08-05 13:51:41 My guess is that you are shorting the stocks of companies in the U.S. suffering from your tariffs.............only to buy them back when you think they have hit rock bottom..    because after all.............it's you!
671 2018-08-05 13:51:36 Beginners of day traders mistake and beaware don't do these mistake s

676 2018-08-05 13:47:41 I started brokerage accounts for each of my kids when they were born. When they were old enough to participate they helped pick stocks of companies that produced goods my kids were into. They both have held AAPL since the mid 2000's which has been very very good to them.

690 2018-08-05 13:36:05 the smash 4 community exploded after zack & lima (bayo dittos) decided to goof off at EVO by stalling, giving homie stocks, etc (playing more like a friendly instead of a GF of the most prestigious FC tourney), and fans booed the shit out of them/started walking out
a fitting end

692 2018-08-05 13:33:16 590!! And yes there were some stocks hhhhh
693 2018-08-05 13:32:53 Though most of the stocks are highly inflated,these guys still believe there's some value left.. absolutely ridiculous..
694 2018-08-05 13:32:45 but that said, I think you on to something re the power of the S&P 500 index. which is tracked by passive and hugged by active = a lot of money chasing moms and biggest stocks. But that story is not just a passive one.
695 2018-08-05 13:31:35 ang alam ko kasi pag trader yun yung bumibili ng stocks e tas benta rin pag tumaas meron mga mura lang na stocks e di pa abot ng hundreds ata haha

705 2018-08-05 13:15:40 Shouldn't you be sharing the fact that U.S. stock dividends are taxable in a TFSA but not in an RRSP?  I still hold U.S. stocks in my TFSA, but it was a fact I did not learn for some time.

2. $UUUU, $urg- s232 play.. And they are already producing.
3. $Pdn - uranium pure play.. Half the resources $CCJ owns....
720 2018-08-05 13:00:31 And also when you use 9 trillion more dollars of deficit money and feed it artificially into the economy the stocks may rise.  The debt doubled. Also Obama had a hand in the Citibank/Fannie Mae episode.  Dig. #saudiarabia

741 2018-08-05 12:26:54 US stocks' performance was very strong in the mid-90s, when the number of public companies was at its peak. This seems to contradict your thesis.
742 2018-08-05 12:26:06 Is this the same as they say that if a taxi driver advises you to buy stocks to make a quick buck, run like the wind in the opposite direction and sell? 
743 2018-08-05 12:25:48 Good advice. I look for stocks where at least 80% of their daily volume are actual real orders and not computer generated.
744 2018-08-05 12:25:20 Erratic economic growth is in sustainable: 
a) tax cuts,
b) tariffs or trade deficit imbalance,
c) investment in stocks or bonds, etc.
Its infrastructure, industrial, technology, innovation development and 'foreign investment' that sustains long term growth, avoid repeat of 2008.
745 2018-08-05 12:24:57 If you look at Trump's actions and the results of those actions since being in office, there is literally no grounds for suggesting anything improper or that a financial crisis is looming. If it were the case the stocks would be fluctuating for one.

757 2018-08-05 12:01:14 Micro & nanocap stocks are one of the most inefficient markets, whereby companies in those categories can be undervalued for such a long period & when discovered that valuation gap can close quite quickly generating a significant alpha over a short period of time..

763 2018-08-05 11:45:40 I felt like this was an insult to what the EVO is. I mean, they had fun, and that's ok, but we were supposed to see the best players worlwide and instead we got a For Glory match, with taunts, homie stocks and all. Zero, Ally, Salem... they fought for the title. Did they, here ?
764 2018-08-05 11:44:33 @HMRCcustomers I opened a stocks & shares ISA in March 2018 for the full annual allowance.

795 2018-08-05 10:48:36 $URA is a funny old beast.  It is very heavily promoted and doesn't seem to get discounted for execution risk of the restart (ie what will the production and opex actually turn out to be).

891 2018-08-05 08:19:58 True. But picking midcaps is tougher than large caps. New stocks will go up. Some stocks which have crashed 70% may never recover. But if one hasn't exited midcaps before the crash now it is better to stay invested and hope for a bounce in future.

923 2018-08-05 07:26:00 This is what I'm talking about with the ignorance thing. 

That's not fucking true. You can start a partnership with people for the cost of filing fees, or as founders purchase stocks at par value (aka fractions of a penny). 

Will you acknowledge you were wrong about this?

927 2018-08-05 07:18:31 there were also homie stocks and honestly, if you watched the footage with no context as to who the players were, you would question why is this happening in grand finals.
928 2018-08-05 07:17:27 My first memory of seeing @LimaBayo play was him bodying Fatality last year at EVO 2017 but SDing the game away.

Fast forward to 2018 where that same player homie stocks a game away but still wins EVO

Really wild stuff.  Great job though Lima, I loved all of grands

943 2018-08-05 07:03:22 The f&o inclusion is another fraud perpetuating thing. India does not have more than a dozen stocks that genuinely could be in our fake F&O. Futures settled in cash?
944 2018-08-05 07:03:19 It’s a dominoe effect to value, investment firms pump shit stocks where they make the profit (capital raised) to later invest in value, all the while keeping the price of valuable coins low.
945 2018-08-05 07:01:07 Sort of. My definition of collusion is if both players play in a manner that shows they aren't being serious.

Homie stocks happen fairly often in friendlies and it's because there's a lot of dumb ways to lose stocks in Smash 4. In tournament, though, it is usually nonexistent.

948 2018-08-05 06:50:54 We have noticed three local supermarkets with VERY low stock here.  It's odd.  Rumours abound that one or two of them are closing because the staff levels and stocks are so low. It's countrywide.  Something is afoot.  Brexit will get the blame probably

Apparently, because I actually tuned out after LFs and then came back when I saw there was drama), and then both Zack and Lima were stalling the whole first game of the 2nd set of Grands>

964 2018-08-05 06:28:26 You will be laughed out of any room today if you predict Hyperinflation of fiat currencies and a massive bull market in Gold. You will be able taken seriously however if you believe in US Stocks and "growth". Makes it pretty clear what you need to do.
965 2018-08-05 06:28:23 If you don’t see the need for an advisor, go direct. If you don’t see the need for a fund manager, pick stocks directly. Choose an advisor and or fund manager only if you receive more value than what you pay.
966 2018-08-05 06:27:38 They are popping up a little more on Yahoo Japan too recently.. two sellers in particular have decent stocks of high end PSA graded cards 
967 2018-08-05 06:25:43 They only stopped because they were told to, and the fact that they stalled and did homie stocks at all is collusion itself. You can't compare people harassing Bayonetta players (which yeah is shitty) to this. Of course it gained more attention.

970 2018-08-05 06:24:12 they stopped stalling, homie stocks are allowed, and they werent colluding at all
971 2018-08-05 06:22:37 Let me tell you why you're wrong. 
Unless I'm threatening or inciting outward violence, I'm allowed to say anything I want. Freedom of speed also means freedom to nasty speech.
Stalling, homie stocks, fooling around, and collusion are against literal tournament rules.
972 2018-08-05 06:21:42 they are friends who essentially played a BO5 friendly during GF. 2 sets in a row with homie stocks, and during a reset they attempted a 5 minute stall by holding Neutral B for almost 2 minutes before @BearUNLV quoted the ruleset over intentional stalling of the match
973 2018-08-05 06:20:28 Your Stocks and MF investments are your good friends because they stay with you during good and bad phases in the market. MFs maximise your returns during Bull phases and minimise your losses when Bears arrive.

A friend in a need is a Stock or MF indeed.

977 2018-08-05 06:16:29 Before anyone misunderstands me, while I find what happened at Smash 4 Grand Finals hilarious, as a former T.O. I do understand the ire.

- mid-match interviews? No. AFTER the tournament.
- homie stocks? Since when was EVO all friendlies?
- mid-match stalling is a no-no. (thread)
978 2018-08-05 06:14:42 Sure you call homie stocks in grands "giving it your all" but I SD round 2 and I get called free???

989 2018-08-05 06:07:17 Last 3 stocks lost almost 80% from the actual price, how can a stock lose so much...?
990 2018-08-05 06:06:27 No one is saying that. Good for them for making it. But seriously stalling? Then homie stocks? At Evo grand finals? Even if your "friends" you shouldn't do that. There still has to be a competitive spirit.
991 2018-08-05 06:05:04 For DUBU cushions currently are no stocks at twice summer store and also my supplier dont have stocks already

994 2018-08-05 06:02:26 Look at your sources!!!!!!  Instead look at the numbers from the stocks. Those are impartial.  The nytimes is not!
995 2018-08-05 06:01:26 Homie stocks which is basically when someone falls of the stage from their own mistake the other player does it (basically throwing away a huge advantage), stalling the matches out for no reason, just playing the matches with seemingly little effort. Pretty lame for Evo GF stage.

999 2018-08-05 05:58:40 Sir, Respect a lots to your views and twts  n follows them religiously .my  concern is the  criteria  for  inclusion and exclusion should be broad based , transparent/communicated . There many  deserving candidates like many of Adani Group stocks and many more like that  u know
1000 2018-08-05 05:58:29 But the next month options in stocks are generally less liquid.
1001 2018-08-05 05:56:55 Its not implied. The Japanese treat this seriously. If you are going to stall and play around and do homie stocks that isn't cool
1002 2018-08-05 05:56:43 you mean your homie kills themselves by accident and you drop a stock for 'em? sure, not what most people would do in grand finals at evo but that isn't collusion. there are plenty of instances of homie stocks in tournaments.
1003 2018-08-05 05:56:02 I’m also hearing that Japanese twitter is absolutely furious at the inappropriate conduct on display 

I love Zack and I love Bayo player antics, but EVO Grands was not the stage for homie stocks and stalling the match.

1009 2018-08-05 05:53:06 2 friends that main bayo made it to EVO grands and "lame'd" it out by throwing stocks away and the whole community is blowing up from it
1010 2018-08-05 05:50:40 Bayo GF with Lima (W) and zack (L). Tied 2-2 first set, zack SD’s, and Lima homie stocks for some reason. And then, start of 2nd set, the most bizarre thing happens. Both players hold down their neutral B’s for 3 minutes stalling until beat breaks it up by neighing out the rules.
1011 2018-08-05 05:49:03 lima homie stocks game 5 pre reset, both bayos charging bullet arts for several minutes at start of game 1

Hey, if they don't give a fuck about the finals, DQ them and let's get on with the rest of the night. What a disappointing end to Smash 4 at evo. #evo2018
1017 2018-08-05 05:44:01 Zack and Lima(some of the best Bayos in the word) are in Grand Finals and they are treating it like a joke

Homie stocks, stalling, chit-chat between matches, etc. 

Fuck EVO but this is a disgrace to the competitive integrity of the tournament
1018 2018-08-05 05:43:13 Do you hold just 5 stocks?
1019 2018-08-05 05:42:32 I think that in the end it will not matter with what kind of means you would like to pay. Money, DA, VC, gold, stocks bonds or any kind of value. The trick is that in the end the other party receives watch he wants. Now that is ILP. 
1020 2018-08-05 05:41:58 Investing into my first few stocks this year. The earlier the better.
1021 2018-08-05 05:41:42 Well, I can never time the bottom, nor do I try to. I just think $TUR has limited downside here for someone willing to hold 2+ years. I have stocks as well as sold Feb ’19 puts at 30$ strike price with good premiums. We’ll see how it plays out.
1022 2018-08-05 05:40:56 Giving free stocks in Grand finals at EVO...

This whole top 8 has really hurt for a lot of people
1023 2018-08-05 05:38:59 When 18 Teams vie for talent in a sport in the world, the talent stocks get diluted. You’ll never have all teams in a league as good as the Top couple. The ALeague has a diluted talent stockpile yet they can draw on the entire world! No sport is immune from a talent dropoff.
1024 2018-08-05 05:38:46 Yo wtf is this grand finals for smash 4 evo 2018? Not only that there is two bayos but they’re stalling and giving out homie stocks. OMEGALUL.

1035 2018-08-05 05:29:42 You must find a smaller, more open and customer centric broker. Big ones want you to trade more. These regulations don't want you to trade. So the big boys won't be keen on these stocks.
1036 2018-08-05 05:28:09 Let's say that today you are sitting on a $500k portfolio, equally split among 4 FANG stocks (@facebook, @apple, @netflix, @Google).

The Dow Jones then falls -20%.  Which do you think best represents what your portfolio is worth?

1038 2018-08-05 05:24:32 Finding a stocks and buying is just 20%, rest 80% is trade management + position sizing. #fact 

People are wasting more time and energy on that first 20% part. #observation
1039 2018-08-05 05:23:17 Good for viewership.
Terrible for competition.
Players already have to combat rage, 2 stocks, and now BO3 at high level play.  Its too much IMO.
1040 2018-08-05 05:22:48 If by that you mean raise taxes for millionaires and billionaires, not let people put children in cages and ban semi-automatic assault rifles and bump stocks, you are spot-on.
1041 2018-08-05 05:21:15 Agree. ASM mainly cracks down on circular trading. How difficult you think it is for SEBI to crackdown on this? These days circular trading seems high tech and automated. Have observed this in market depth on above mentioned stocks.

1046 2018-08-05 05:17:07  your start was much more rational. Mine was crazier.. I tried everything - stocks, future, options & no TA or even basic price charts..
1047 2018-08-05 05:16:05 Thanks for sharing the info.  However I think your issue price for many of the stocks is incorrect. Eg. KTD, RFR, VN8, CR1 are all at 20c.  B2Y at 35c

1053 2018-08-05 05:10:41 I owned stocks through the earlier PCAS, then the intervening GSM level3 & now ASM. 

I held on, even bought where i had conviction.

Retail investors must take responsibility for decisions.

Drivers must remember that traffic can be unruly. And that order will need be restored.

Obama legalized bump stocks

M. Sanger
1057 2018-08-05 05:04:26 Mr. Shekher I agree with most of twts, excepts this, as ASM has been designed to cheat  retail investors and benefit big fish as hardly there is any change  in stocks pre and post ASM like Venkys  and many

1073 2018-08-05 04:46:10 Why do you need bump stocks and AR-15s, freak?  Why do you need hundreds of guns, freak?  Why you not care that kids are being killed in schools by the dozens?  Why are you listening to a**holes with their conspiracy theories about babies not dying in a school shooting?

1078 2018-08-05 04:41:45 Ban DTC (direct to consumer) ads (Magazine, TV). They drive up costs with no value. If healthcare is a right, make all drug co.'s non-profit, unable to sell stocks, which makes them beholden to shareholders, not patients.  Note Nick's points below.  (I'm a pharmacist.)

Some ideas: 3 day waiting period. Close online & "gun show" loopholes. Ban bump stocks. Has to be a beginning somewhere

1093 2018-08-05 04:12:36 Fact-A good stock market reflects consumer spending & confidence. It benefits ALL not only those who own stocks. It is a reflection of a strong economy.People ARE spending. They wouldn’t be spending if they were hurting the way you are suggesting.Poor income would = poor economy
1094 2018-08-05 04:12:15 Cash will dry up my friend...leave only 1% cash in economy n let cash lie wid banks who will never circulate it again ....cash crunch will force people to take legal routes

1102 2018-08-05 04:03:01 Bitcoin plus the scaling layers will leave very little room for other crypto. In fact bitcoin and its ecosystem will dig pretty deep into stocks and real estate, taking back the role of store of value.
1103 2018-08-05 04:01:32 I found out the Mormon church has over 3 billion dollars in stocks, and that's why I'm atheist now

1105 2018-08-05 04:00:33 Record what? Handed a good Economy on a sliver platter. If you have the Corp & wealthiest mega tax cuts - sure bump in stocks wage earnings are not keeping pace.

1143 2018-08-05 03:25:45 Her husband invested in a company for the 1st time, then less than 2 weeks later that company announced it signed a huge govt contract. Stocks soared. Identical stories w/ husbands of Sen. Boxer & Sen. Feinstein. I wish I had the same timing w/o being accused of insider trading.
1144 2018-08-05 03:25:01 Yes, I know of that too, but I guess I thought that Fox TV had the biggest footprint. I really don't know the statistics, tho.

I've just personally know more people brainwashed by Fox. And Fox is treated as a somewhat credible outfit, more so than the radio, I mean. Stocks too.
1145 2018-08-05 03:24:24 its been sideways and compared to rest of market yea its been AWESOME - NOONE can curse the ceo for losing their money ..unlike so many other garbage stocks out there not named fang .. i know i should hold but if only all were like tsla martin
1146 2018-08-05 03:23:28 Haha, i feel everyone  has a shot, but according to those statistics you must pick and choose your battles of stocks or cryptos or whatever it is that you like. Trading isnt easy, if it were everybody would be doing it.

1157 2018-08-05 03:16:44 People used to go to public executions, too. Bloodier & longer, the better. They gathered round the whipping post & the stocks; they cheered when Dissenters were branded or carved on.

Sadism comes in many forms.
1158 2018-08-05 03:16:01 And I don’t expect everyone to be on board. But back then making the game 2 stocks made sense because the meta was very neutral and defensive based. Now it’s punish heavy and early kills, and making the game 2 stocks with that meta doesn’t seem right imo
1159 2018-08-05 03:14:53 Hawala can be drastically reduced by reducing physical currency....hawala txns are atleast in Lacs n crores , 5-10 k cash transactions are not lethal.... eventually hawala money comes to banks , so hawala doesn't creates a problem

They also provide healthcare, dental, vision, sick and maternal pay, vacation pay, stocks, 401k's, retirement, training and college, they match S.S, and Medicaid payroll taxes, I'm GLAD we have wealthy people in the U.S.

1168 2018-08-05 03:09:25 @ByronBernstein hey bro, quick question. Where do you invest in stocks ?
1169 2018-08-05 03:08:11 PE is not the only yardstick for picking multi bagger stocks or for investing. I will give u PE of stocks above 100 but still giving fabulous returns and PE of stocks below 10 giving worst returns..
1170 2018-08-05 03:08:04 So did we ever ban bump stocks or nah?
1171 2018-08-05 03:07:59 First I'm 1% of a millionaire
But if was a millionaire
I'll diversify My wealth
65% in Crypto
10% in stocks
15% in bonds and real estate
10% to potential people !!!
1172 2018-08-05 03:07:03 Can you take your foot off the neck of the Chinese stocks, thx
1173 2018-08-05 03:06:24 they already did testing on this in the first year(s) of smash 4 and concluded that 3 stocks was NOT in anyway significantly more "consistent" than 2 stocks. results tended to be exactly the same.

1175 2018-08-05 03:05:24 They made room for the T in the stocks app...
1176 2018-08-05 03:00:56 Melee games would still last longer than 3 stock smash 4 and brawl was way slower and was 3 stock. Randomly making smash 4 2 stocks when there’s rage and stocks can disappear makes no sense to me and makes results way too inconsistent imo
1177 2018-08-05 03:00:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. #tradeforex #stocks
1178 2018-08-05 02:59:40 Sa bagay. Ano nga naman mabibili ng mga sasali sa raffle if walang stocks  yung sa trinoma super limited. May address ba doon sa raffle entry? Di ko na maalala yung finill up ko haha. Pero if oo baka pwede tayong sumulat or magpetition para maiwasan yung pagbulk buy ng iba 
1179 2018-08-05 02:58:09 Hey, anyone remember when Trump and the #NRAgate said they would ban bump stocks? #PromisesMadePromisesBroken
1180 2018-08-05 02:57:26 Also, private prison stocks are up 100% due to Trump.

The stocks of 2 biggest private prison operators -- CoreCivic (formerly know as Corrections Corp. of America) & Geo Group -- have doubled since election day. CoreCivic (CXW) is up 140% since Trump won; Geo Group has risen 98%
1181 2018-08-05 02:55:29 Trump is turning the camera back on them.  Nothing more.  Stocks have not tumbled.  Missiles are not airborne.  The only ones hurt are those that are not FAIR.  Just my take.

1187 2018-08-05 02:46:05 I think you recently linked to the "LT3000" blog. I think in one of his posts he mentions having ~150 open positions and that he follows several thousands stocks. I have no idea how that's possible, even working 24/7.
1188 2018-08-05 02:45:52 ProTip: Look at stocks as say, a manager of a sports team would, ie if the player performs, keep him, if he underperforms cut him, period!

1195 2018-08-05 02:36:32 @markminervini I bought some stocks with good fundamentals but are hammered in current situation because of trade war fear. I don’t wanna sell at loss. Margin will give me chance to lower down average and I have ability to clear debt in 2 years.
1196 2018-08-05 02:34:53 I’m officially an adult now because i just had a 30 minute conversation with my dad about stocks.
1197 2018-08-05 02:32:59 “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1198 2018-08-05 02:28:00 FYI - iSatanist is having a delicious liquidation sale on Cloisonné Sigil of Baphomet medallions.

Get yourself a bargain while stocks last!
1199 2018-08-05 02:27:55 Oh boo goo the NRA can’t bribe GOP Congress anymore cuz their Russian go between is in jail!! Oh so f sad !!!Remember bump stocks? AK-15? Mass killings? Oh booohoooo ! NRA is running out of $$$$$
1200 2018-08-05 02:25:23 Stocks will drop, foreclosures will increase, farmers will sell for pennies on the dollar - Trump and his faux-populist (b)millionaires will swoop in to grab these at low prices. Trump leaves office, Dem comes in and fixes his mess. Prices increase, Trump profits. #MAGA

1202 2018-08-05 02:22:46 Worst case scenario, stocks relating to our farms will drop in value for a period of time, hurting American farmers temporarily. Then a Democrat president will reverse everything Trump did like with an Infinity Gauntlet so stocks will jump after farmer profits increase. @GOP @DNC

1204 2018-08-05 02:22:16 The game isn’t about percentage lead lol it’s about taking stocks.
1205 2018-08-05 02:21:46 "unemployment is down stocks are up but wages havent gone up nobody knows why!" Have you tried talking to...literally anyone that's had a job before?
1206 2018-08-05 02:21:07 Worst case scenario, stocks relating to our farmers will drop in value for a period of time, hurting American farmers temporarily.

1208 2018-08-05 02:15:15 If you are a millionaire and you look to invest in stocks or crypto....which one has the most upside? If you said stock market your investment career will be shortest in the history  do yourself a favor and retire b4 you even start
1209 2018-08-05 02:14:16 In the intrest of streamlining our character mechanics, Nine can now cycle her spells instead of attacking to build stocks. We did this because we felt the Nine/Tager matchup should be completely unwinnable
1210 2018-08-05 02:12:53 As I'm a sucker for looking at UIs, from the new #BBTAG trailer:
Nine: builds a bar into a maxiumum of two stocks to use for her spells
Akihiko: Cyclone level is in
Labrys: Axe meter is back as a normal bar, only green/red state seen. Ticks down, still can cash in

No other bars
1211 2018-08-05 02:12:03 Stocks plunged as Community Health Systems, Inc. unveiled a ferocious carrots today.
1212 2018-08-05 02:08:52 And none of the "booming " businesses are trickling down.  They are giving to their stock holders and buying back there own stocks which puts more $$ into the CEO pockets.
1213 2018-08-05 02:07:29 As soon as China announces its official response to Trump’s tariffs, their stocks will jump. @GOP @DNC
1214 2018-08-05 02:06:47 @PeterSchiff In 1974 the CRB was worth 3.48 times the SPX.  Today it is worth 6.8%  of the SPX.  IOW, in 1974 commodities were worth 51 times as much as they  are today relative to stocks. 

I know you know this, but I just wanted to throw it out there.  I just wanted to say it.
1215 2018-08-05 02:06:38 2 stocks was a good balance for this game because it can be very fast and very slow at the same time making it a disaster to run as a tournament. There’s a lot more sides to this issue than one would think and there’s a reason ppl supported 2 stock
1216 2018-08-05 02:06:37 Now is a good time to buy Chinese stocks. @GOP @DNC
1217 2018-08-05 02:06:07 The distortions created by QE are in riskier assets like stocks not sov bonds. CBs removed safe assets to encourage risk taking thru added liquidity. Keep this in mind when you hear people planning to hide in equities because the bond market is the greatest danger. $SPY $TLT
1218 2018-08-05 02:05:18 I’m not wishing for ultimate to make my problems go away. Obviously there’s going to be cheese in every smash game because there is no life bar, but in a game with rage and how often stocks can disappear, 2 stocks is a terrible tourney rule

1221 2018-08-05 01:59:50 If that is so? US should pay back all fines to VW and other car mfr who exceeded the EPA exhaust levels. Trump and his s.k. experts know better. The Chinese hoax can never harm the environment only stocks. Instead Trump's friends will sell more gas and earn more dollar.....

1228 2018-08-05 01:46:44 @realDonaldTrump needs to listen to his instincts and give us Medicare for all, regulate bump stocks, legalize marijuana, legalize prostitution, and legalize gambling.

1231 2018-08-05 01:42:34 Oh no, because of the tariffs the US Midwest has stocks of soybeans and beef that they can't export.

1232 2018-08-05 01:39:14 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131

1234 2018-08-05 01:36:42 @iancassel , your definition of multibagger and common people's understanding of multibagger is pole apart. I completely agree with your thinking line. Having said that, what FI is mentioning multibagger over here are "Hot stocks and stories touted as multibagger picks"
1235 2018-08-05 01:36:25 Alan has been part of the problem since pot stocks first took off. He seems to have no particular analytical skills.
1236 2018-08-05 01:36:15 3 stocks is a disaster for TOs to run with how slow the game can be at times. Brawl saw the fruits of that, and it could’ve been just as bad. People didn’t just randomly decide to do two stocks lol it has to do with tournament efficiency which would be impossible in three stocks

1244 2018-08-05 01:18:34 It is frankly nuts what's going on there. Stocks that are priced to perfection are eventually mis priced.

1248 2018-08-05 01:13:11 First you say stocks being kept artificially high, then you say they went sideways this year, not down.  Which is it, sir? And are you in the lower 60% of wage earners?  If so, why?  Who's holding you back? Is it my responsibility for you to make millions?

1252 2018-08-05 01:04:02 I believe...Its corporate decision & the $$$ effect on the value of Rogers Stocks. The stigma of what happened to Osuna( true or not), shareholders of the company might sell out their holdings thereby lowering the share value of the corporation. My opinion.
1253 2018-08-05 01:03:20 The change up in Sicko Mode is parallel to the change up that’s about to happen in the whole Elevate investing strategy. A percentage is about to be penny stocks and profits again like high school, but this time with so much depth. Elevate accounts are going to go crazy.
1254 2018-08-05 01:02:46 Are stocks really that serious........

1260 2018-08-05 00:55:02 If anything, fish populations would return to normal levels. One study conducted by 14 marine scientists concluded that continued overfishing of the world’s fish stocks will cause “100% of species [to] collapse by the year 2048.” Go vegan!
1261 2018-08-05 00:54:36 Respected again? Dude, we are laughing stocks with Trump.
1262 2018-08-05 00:54:13 Pretty much close to the same value a two Apple stocks. I feel like it’ll go higher. I’m no expert but if the gut says anything it’s probably worth the risk.
1263 2018-08-05 00:52:53 The Milk Pail market in Mountain View stocks them.
1264 2018-08-05 00:52:15 Sharing economy workers shouldn’t be paid below minimum wage(Uber,Lyft). Corporate Employees gets millions in stocks but drivers are in debt for buying cars before Uber dropped their rates without consulting them.

1267 2018-08-05 00:47:43 It is beneficial to some (40 percent?) of people. To many I know, it means nothing. They do not have stocks. One thing matters: wages. They haven't gone up enough to match inflation. Legislation is needed that will tie CEO and management pay to average worker pay.
1268 2018-08-05 00:46:57 Thanks! do you trade CFDs or straight stocks?
1269 2018-08-05 00:45:59 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your phantom limb syndrome
1270 2018-08-05 00:43:03 Thanks, but I don’t strive I AM. America has always been great to those who prepare themselves. Since you mentioned it how does the economy and stocks affect individuals who aren’t investing?
1271 2018-08-05 00:42:25 The Republican soils itself so it is buying more toilet paper as well as stocks in toilet paper. It blames humans for it spoiling itself.
1272 2018-08-05 00:40:09 Run Trump out! Impeach first  try for crimes second. Try for TREASON LAST   MADNITORY SENTENCING. THEN BANISH THEM FROM COUNTRY ! Permanently. He wants to drive us backward in time.  Let’s try for the 16th century ! Public stocks ! Scarlett Leters. Hanging witches. Torture  TRUMP
1273 2018-08-05 00:36:43 I also like $EPD. Been holding it for a long time as well. My picks are lower volatility stocks but solid long term.

1275 2018-08-05 00:34:31 But let’s allow someone to buy dozens of semi automatic weapons and bump stocks so he can fulfill a random fantasy to shoot up a country music concert because this is America where individual rights are more important than the safety of the masses...

1291 2018-08-05 00:09:22 The liquidity of not owning is worth something. Can take 100k for example and buy stocks or bonds. If you are wrong B/O in a security is better than the 10-15% buying and selling a house.

1301 2018-08-04 23:59:05 Aussie #stocks  over 30 yr period returned 9.1 per cent on an annual compound basis, before transaction costs, fees and taxes. But their annual volatility ran to 13.1 per cent, on Vanguard numbers. In five of the past 30 years, you lost money on the Australian #sharemarket .

1342 2018-08-04 23:32:28 People think that just because the stock market is high, that everyone is doing great. Not so. Some middle class have 401K's & see paper gains, but the top 10% own 93% of all stocks. In fact, the top 10% own over half of all the wealth in this country

1350 2018-08-04 23:23:43 With it being a loan interests rates are based on the type of loan. you alwyas try to go for low interest rates and heavily cut down on spending. HEAVILY. personal wealth, investment stocks are the safest way to go about it. on large scale and small scale.
1351 2018-08-04 23:22:18 They used to make twisted rifle stocks to help people aim with that. But i think they were all in the single shot era.
1352 2018-08-04 23:21:19 Some cryptocurrency enthusiasts mistakingly think cryptocurrency or tokens will end the stock market. They won’t. Bitcoin will be used to buy stocks, directly, or through verifiable tokens backed by bitcoin. Stocks are a necessary part of capitalism.
1353 2018-08-04 23:20:47 Do you know everything that needs to be done to assemble those guns?  You cant print a gun or even all the parts needed to make one.  It only prints the receiver. Everything else you must purchase and assemble. The bolts, barrels, trigger groups, stocks etc you must purchase.

1359 2018-08-04 23:04:50 Low unemployment numbers are meaningless in a low wage, gig economy. Corporations used the tax rebates to buy back stocks and give their upper management raises. Trickle down economics has never worked. Reagan exploded the deficits in 1980s, just a Bush43 & tRump are now.

1362 2018-08-04 22:55:15 Haha really? So tell me why David Stocks, SNP leader of North Lanarkshire council attended the “Orange Oscars” in 2016?
1363 2018-08-04 22:55:04 I remember when someone was asking me, when $AMZN was $650, "why won't stocks fall? Everything is so expensive."

My response: it won't break until a systemic catalyst occurs. CBs will have to loose their ability to control markets.

1369 2018-08-04 22:52:08 Sorry not here to get "famous" by posting my selfies. I'm here to trade stocks and make money along with the team members. I enjoy walking down the street while nobody knows who I am or how much money I got. Name is known if you do some more research.
1370 2018-08-04 22:50:29 This isn't a choke for M2K, this is just Armada playing better. 2 stocks each.
1371 2018-08-04 22:49:23 They ARE FOREIGN. Chinese own Smithfield. You all don’t even understand the level of BS in this trade war and bailout. Big international ag will profit. ADM and Cargill stocks already up from it.
1372 2018-08-04 22:48:57 You’re missing the point robbie. Even though all of these are “avoidable” they still happen every single game when someone good is playing that character. The meta revolves around cheese and when there’s only 2 stocks, if you don’t kill someone below 50% you’re likely fucked

1390 2018-08-04 22:34:56 Story or no story, that's why the astute investor "buys into businesses", as opposed to "trading stocks". Subtle change in lingo but profound difference to the result.
1391 2018-08-04 22:34:32 How about oil and related stocks?

 Public shaming and starvation, in the stocks.

1396 2018-08-04 22:19:15 Since wealth is mostly in the form of stocks and options, yes, tax that. There's virtually nobody with billions in cash.

1398 2018-08-04 22:16:40 Part of the problem is that there is no single definition of “value” investing. Are we talking about low P/B, low P/E (or insert favorite multiple) stocks? Or are we talking about stocks trading below estimated intrinsic value, in which the estimate can assume aggressive growth?

1409 2018-08-04 22:03:04 Agreed I did the same with IQE until f’casts caught up

...but market conditions now make holding highly rated stocks more risky than 6-12 moths ago imho ..plus I  can find similar growth with a lower premium eg GAW beats FEVR in my playbook

1411 2018-08-04 21:59:17 Your stupid trade war cost American taxpayers $12 billion in handouts to farmers alone. China just announced retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion in US imports. Uncertainty may be hurting Chinese stocks, but it's not helping America.

1413 2018-08-04 21:58:24 80% of baby boomers, 75% gen ex, and 52% of millennial have 401k plans. 401k plans invested in the market. So everyday folks are actually heavily effected by the changes in stocks. Remember 2008? Nearly everyone saw their retirement dwindle with market crash. Not just 14%

1417 2018-08-04 21:49:31 I mean, it was like repeated 5 stocks. Sure we can all just not say a word but call it differing personalities if you want I just like to talk to people.

1426 2018-08-04 21:35:52 When you read stuff like this: "And, as Bank of America noted one month ago, buybacks represent the only source of demand for shares given most other ownership categories are net sellers of stocks (households, mutual funds, pension funds)." You know how bizzare this has become.
1427 2018-08-04 21:34:31 I used to shy away from writing about sectors/stocks w/ great reward/risk on an absolute basis because of poor relative performance vs the market.

Finally realized it still adds value b/c everyone has different portfolio mandates. Not everyone can own Tech, Medical Devices, etc.
1428 2018-08-04 21:34:29 (1/2) Hey bro, good point, crypto has historically vastly outperformed even many of the highest performing stocks in terms of time taken to achieve growth, but just to demistify the Apple stock a bit, it has been split four times in its history..
1429 2018-08-04 21:34:29 You’d do well to call upon the person currently occupying the office to respect it. He’s turned the USA and the Americans who follow him, into international laughing stocks.

1431 2018-08-04 21:31:27 One would think. But Google has demonstrated callous disregard for their fiduciary responsibility in recent times. As have Twitter & Facebook. Political ideology came to matter more to them. Stocks are tanking as a result. But they're still major players w/out much competition.
1432 2018-08-04 21:30:55 We in Nevada also voted for stricter gun laws such as closing the gun show loophole and banning bump stocks. But our Republican governor and attorney general have refused to take the steps to enforce it. The people spoke....no one listened.

1544 2018-08-04 19:14:44 Take the first stock, do 100% before losing your first and then it’s an even game. With three stocks, if you get hit with bullshit on your second stock, you have another chance to take their stock, and now it’s actually even with no rage on the field. Way better for competition
1545 2018-08-04 19:14:36 Yea like I’m very certain my opinions on rage and certain characters doesn’t get this bad if we played 3 stocks lol because it wouldn’t be as obvious

1551 2018-08-04 19:09:39 Regarding investing in cannabis stocks: They are asking at US Customs if you have any holdings. If you answer positively you will be turned back.  Period of ban may be for life.
1552 2018-08-04 19:07:31 Not talking about any stock, tho.
I wouldn't be exposed in stocks during a crisis.

1554 2018-08-04 19:05:50 Four steps to be successful as an investor:
1- Buy when the price is low, but quality is not
2- Wait for the right time for the market to realize its true value
3- Sell it when everyone is interested in buying it
4- Become a millionaire...

1555 2018-08-04 19:02:56 Tienes que animarte y hacer una comunidad con cuota mensual para que podamos aprender dia a dia contigo. Creo que es una opción mucho mas atractiva que un curso. Solo es una sugerencia, un saludo
1556 2018-08-04 19:02:49 There are still stocks atm :) But I will be traveling back to China on august 27, so some of the small items, like the keychains and posters wont be shipped until this year november
1557 2018-08-04 19:02:36 It lost less than the stock market. It is a risk off destination. Cash is. I’m
Not talking about currency pairs. I’m
Talking about when funds put their capital during a crisis. Cash flees stocks and goes into the USD. That is a fact. Even though the US is bankrupt.
1558 2018-08-04 19:02:24 Donald, you got paid off by the NRA to keep your mouth shut on assault rifles and BUMP STOCKS - which you said would be banned. We will not forget come voting time. In following your twitter account, we know WHO NOT TO VOTE FOR including Troy Balderson.
1559 2018-08-04 19:02:03 Lol.  People all around society have been walking, working & driving for generations stoned.  This includes police, lawyers, teachers, doctors, dentists and in most every other profession or industry.  We are all still just fine.  Buy stocks in Doritos & chill everyone.
1560 2018-08-04 18:59:47 3 or 4 is definitely preferable. If it’s 2 stocks again ima be livid
1561 2018-08-04 18:57:15 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks, Mr. President you said out loud you would take on the NRA and get bump stocks banned. Then a nice little meeting with the NRA closed your mouth in a hurry. This is deplorable, and as much as I like you, you have lost my vote forever! Won't forget!
1562 2018-08-04 18:56:49 Still waiting for precious metals to have their day. Must admit I didn’t see U stocks taking off before PMs like this.

1564 2018-08-04 18:56:24 Everyone I speak to who’s involved in banking and stocks seems to think crypto is a joke even Belfort thinks it’s a dead hype train and if anyone was to take advantage of something it would be him. Dunno make money quickly would be my bet with crypto long game is dead
1565 2018-08-04 18:51:12 Definitely. In a game where you can just explode at 0%, 2 stocks is terrible. It’s literally half of your life and it can take so much to bring it back if you’re one character, or maintain the lead if you’re another character
1566 2018-08-04 18:47:34 It also doesn't help that if you SD you have to work just as hard to bring it back 
I played 3 stocks in Texas and I loved it, it made you think more and it helped with endurance
1567 2018-08-04 18:47:06 Products cost $, share holders require profits for their stocks, when it comes to certain life saving things yea it sucks, but they are a business with products and share holders. Let’s also not forget that hospitals are now more corporate owned which means they add mark up too
1568 2018-08-04 18:46:49 like stocks doing any better
1569 2018-08-04 18:46:44 The paper or the stocks?
1570 2018-08-04 18:46:20 Same, and I hate that it’s taking me until now to realize how bad 2 stocks really is for this game. I hate taking the first stock, dealing another 100% before I lose my first stock, and then it being an even game just like that. It’s why consistency is so hard in this game imo
1571 2018-08-04 18:45:49 Investing in stocks during different time periods
1572 2018-08-04 18:43:27 That’s why we couldn’t unveil him yesterday. We couldn’t find an astronaut suit. Cheston was sent to Blackpool today to find a fancy dress shop that stocks them....fingers crossed for a Monday signing, folks.
1573 2018-08-04 18:42:46 Na. You can go look at the code. If you’re going to label it scam, then it’s just as much as a scam as your dollars that sit in the bank. Been tracking BTC market for a couple years. Volatility is normal. 

“Going down” is pretty meaningless. It doesn’t work like normal stocks.
1574 2018-08-04 18:42:11 You can't possibly be serious. Everyone google who Kelly Ann Conway works for just google who she buys stocks from and who she pays and who pays her. Duck duck goose. Duck duck go.
1575 2018-08-04 18:41:24 Nah, I get it, its just that the Cuban deal is directly with MoviePass, so, yeah, the parent company benefits but indirectly.

Cuban ain't a billionaire 'cause he invested in stocks that dropped 99% in two weeks. Twice, lol.
1576 2018-08-04 18:41:18 What kind of people even use the “stocks” app that comes with iPhones

Still need another 2-3 years to set record for largest total returns. If we avoid recession I think we can do it.
1590 2018-08-04 18:28:39 Sensible gun laws would render the possession of assault style weapons and excessive stocks of weapons illegal. Lives would be saved. You rights are no greater than the rights of children to live free from gun violence. Your guns put you at risk.

1606 2018-08-04 18:06:16 Learnt similiar lesson with TATA MOTORS.
In the quest for finding value we often buy stocks when they are falling only to realise that they are on their way to an indefinite downtrend. 
So its best to follow the trend & be profitable at the end of the day #lessonlearned

1611 2018-08-04 18:02:18 Atulji, there are many so called experts who were recommending stocks disappeared for the last 6 months. One who claims as expert should be there during market correction too.
1612 2018-08-04 18:00:25 Same. I remember one activity was giving us a fake amount of money to invest in stocks and monitor weekly through the newspaper. I was in third grade. Now I'm in my 30s and I barely have money to invest, let alone have any idea how to.
1613 2018-08-04 17:59:07 Basically. Too much effort and not enough results to show for it. I mean, call me bad, but you can just lose to the dumbest and most random stuff. Idk if it’s because of 2 stocks but I didn’t really notice this problem in melee. Melee shows hard work paying off more than 4 imo
1614 2018-08-04 17:55:44 Many talk of stocks with 20% cagr or more. I am happy with 15% cagr over 2 decades. There are many MF schemes with more than 15% returns over a 10 year period. I do not have the skill to identify a multibagger. Slow and steady "get rich" is fine with me. #investing

1624 2018-08-04 17:41:54 It is a fallacy that all good numbers come early and bad numbers later. Then, let's make a portfolio of stocks which declares results early... simple!
1625 2018-08-04 17:40:36 Opportunities abound during #stocks' weakest month. While #August has historically been the worst month for the S&P 500 Index, on average, seasonal analysis can help you uncover potential investment opportunities to benefit your portfolio during this seasonally fragile time.
1626 2018-08-04 17:39:49 Apologies for being unclear, I’m not saying that stocks are perfectly priced. I’m saying in order to outperform the market, one must find a mispriced stock, which definitely exist!
1627 2018-08-04 17:39:40 A frustrating short. But when story stocks collapse they don’t touch the sides. A market wide rush for liquidity or a going concern warning crushes $TSLA if financing options disappear. Still holding the bear put spread.

1663 2018-08-04 17:07:28 Depleted fish stocks would be my guess
1664 2018-08-04 17:07:21 That is a lie. Obama said the jobs weren't going to come back. Do you think the stocks would have went up with less jobs in America? Your comment isn't true.

1679 2018-08-04 16:52:22 seems good idea. but what about cash transactions? ppl will avoid bank credit in that case and keep hoarding cash.
1680 2018-08-04 16:51:50 It all depends on how many people will get involved in the future! If you have 5 stocks every day that you can trade nicely and organically right now, it may not work when you have the same 5 stocks and 300% more traders around the globe, it’s called competitions :(
1681 2018-08-04 16:50:26 So do most people that invest in stocks, real estate or any other form of business.
1682 2018-08-04 16:49:28 The low unemployment number does not mean Americans are profiting and prosperous.The unemployment rate has been on this trajectory since before trump took office. Currently worker's wages are dropping and corporations are using the money from the tax cut to buyback stocks.
1683 2018-08-04 16:49:08 Yeee, meaning more fakeouts, more headaches and more chop... The more unexperienced people there are in the market the more chop we see... also due to crowd of a single or two stocks at the same time...
1684 2018-08-04 16:46:29 @Brawlhalla is fun but desperately needs a 4P free-for-all mode that is 3 stocks instead of forcing players to play Time mode in FFA.  I can live with being forced to play ranked if I want 1v1 3 stocks, but jamming FFA for fun and being stuck playing Time mode is th WORST.
1685 2018-08-04 16:46:08 You will come to Chennai for a work. Your friend here will take you for  dinings.Your friend will drop you back at Koyambedu!Every time you visit, you always have stocks to talk past  stories!Will be the same in future too !All tomorrows!little things in life #Chennaiyumnanbanum
1686 2018-08-04 16:45:14 Uh...ok? When did I advocate $15? The tax cut was a sham. Businesses pocketed and bought back stocks. Facts are certainly real.

1689 2018-08-04 16:43:44 When I am king, loud people will be pilloried in the stocks like thieves.

1690 2018-08-04 16:43:22 Inc in Centaurus, Islamabad stocks them
1691 2018-08-04 16:43:17 Yeah. I deal with housing issues all day, every day. The number one issue? Need overwhelms supply, because the stock rental costs are too high.

People need alternatives until affordable housing stocks can keep up with demand. Guaranteed incomes go a tremendous distance.
1692 2018-08-04 16:43:12 #ATOM is where 2 stocks are shared. From this year, it went into annual mode. All those who went for it, receive them. Shall open subs in Dec for year 2019. Details would appear then.
1693 2018-08-04 16:43:11 Hi @RedDogT3 , I’ve found that certain stocks work better than others;also that it seems to work best at prices near B.B. extremes. Is that your experience as well? This has been a great tactic! Thank you!

They'll forever be growth stocks. If you put your money in the past, today, or tomorrow, and wait long enough you'll see a triple digit return.
1729 2018-08-04 16:15:28 If 1 can get to know about market cycle's then why 1 would invest in mutual fund sir ?
They will directly invest in stocks.

Typically,investor who want to invest through mutual funds may not want to get into daily watching.Their need is just cost avereging and a bit high return.

1757 2018-08-04 15:43:17 What I mean by that is if I'm investing $5,400, I'm investing $5,400. Whether that's 3 shares of AMZN or 290 shares of AMD, it's still all percentage-based gains in the end.

1782 2018-08-04 15:25:24 How are stocks not “mispriced”? I’m open to changing my mind but my current understanding keeps me from believing in this argument. For instance I played AMD as it came down from the 10$ range. Their “story” of superior products and intels floundering seemed obvious to me.

1813 2018-08-04 14:58:56 Please show me where President Trump tweet is racist?  I see a man fighting for American jobs every day not someone unhinged.  Show me unhinged?  Minority employment is at an all-time high thanks to Trump. Stocks up and growth is booming for ALL Americans. MAGA
1814 2018-08-04 14:58:52 Thx Ched. The most expensive RE markets, incl. LA area, are starting to tank -- days on market going up, prices flattening -- first signs IMO of the broader (stocks, USD, RE) downturn/collapse that is coming soon.
1815 2018-08-04 14:58:34 @iamrakeshbansal Bansal sir

1816 2018-08-04 14:58:18 It is always difficult to sell short low volume & low float stocks because it is hard to borrow the shares.

1819 2018-08-04 14:53:44 Hypo: the ~1998 increasing pace for top 50% is internet-fueled stock market growth; crisis drop for bottom 50% is greater because all wealth tied to housing prices; subsequent differences driven by stock market again. So % of wealth in house vs. stocks may drive everything?
1820 2018-08-04 14:53:33 That a 10-12% levered FCF yield is cheap for a cash flow stream that will likely shrink into perpetuity. Valuation generally has low and high bounds despite DCF suggesting many more stocks should trade for 6x earnings and some for 100x.

1822 2018-08-04 14:50:41 We've had a few enquiries about bringing children along to this year's event. The venue allows accompanied children until 7pm, at which point it becomes adults only.

1823 2018-08-04 14:49:23 Saw an interesting comment the other day on reddit and have been mulling over since. Ackman's portfolio is all big name stocks, easily replicable by the average retail investor. What are people paying for exactly?
1824 2018-08-04 14:49:03 Yep. In office for eight yrs. made lots of noise about immigration reform and gun laws-Dems had House/Senate for two years. Why didn’t he pass “meaninglful legislation” re firearms? Bump stocks and AR15s existed in 2008. Don’t believe they were even a campaign issue. Interesting
1825 2018-08-04 14:48:55 Any ETF or stocks to buy? TY
1826 2018-08-04 14:48:14 That’s true for stocks and also life, but all we do know is that markets do have cycles, and cryptos are no way near matured
1827 2018-08-04 14:46:41 I sense someone prep'ing a message to annoy @elonmusk . For his reaction to send the stocks done again.
1828 2018-08-04 14:44:36 Risky to stock means that there are chances no one might need it till it expires. That's a loss. That's why no pharmacy in the country stocks them.

1837 2018-08-04 14:33:30 I starved for 10 days once, when a business failed badly.
Watched over weeks as my food stocks disappeared & no way to replenish.
Never considered a foodbank, nor would I.
I went looking for small 'homers' to bring in some cash, then gathered myself together again.
Like an adult.

1844 2018-08-04 14:25:52 Should we index instead of owning individual stocks?

1848 2018-08-04 14:17:54 Went to Lidi Abbey Wood today, flower display blocking cycle parking area. From a company that stocks cycling products from time to time. To which I have purchased, being outstanding value. So why is Lidi anti cycling? Doesn't make sense, you should be promoting cycling?
1849 2018-08-04 14:17:10 Nice recommendation!  Hopefully my local Tescos stocks it.

1852 2018-08-04 14:14:58 You hate him because you are told to hate him.  Mind control is a terrible thing. I own stocks and so can you. Don’t be jealous because you made different choices. Lots of people want welfare, free money. Don’t fool yourself that everyone wants to work and earn money. Wake up.

1892 2018-08-04 13:40:58 Absolutely right  and people are more focused on finding next page.Some astute investors even diversified to new stocks on same sector only to sell them after some years.

1896 2018-08-04 13:32:58 Gift of Appreciated Stock: A gift of appreciated stocks, bonds, or mutual funds can both support the program and provide tax saving to the donor.

1897 2018-08-04 13:32:31 This is so true. Now you take it a step further, and analyze what makes a "good" investment, you will realize its not stocks but real estate. Good behaviour is key to growing a profitable real estate investment portfolio!

1924 2018-08-04 13:08:22 @arunjaitley @arunjaitley sir, your decision of applying LTCG on stocks held for more then a year has inconvenienced small investors,  but has incentivised the tradering action for those who are only looking for short gains.  Kindly consider reverting it.
1925 2018-08-04 13:07:17 In over two decades of investing, don't think i have ever seen so many stocks making double percentage moves as so commonly happens now-a-days. Be it for ASM reasons or good/bad results or any other news, volatility in too many stocks is way too high for comfort!

1928 2018-08-04 13:06:18 FYI in case you failed American history AND English like our current  POTUS, here's help. Typically, after stocks stabilize, wars end, and economy gets back on track, jobs tend to stabilize as well. If I toss an apple into the air, is it Trump who causes it to fall to Earth?
1929 2018-08-04 13:05:24 With AI gaining steam, automation and ML could be as consequential as the internet itself. I would guess that a lot more nations could take the Chinese route and become protectionist with tech industries. This could mean some US tech stocks are too over valued.

1938 2018-08-04 12:58:42 I think the comparisons are fair - 1 is just a hell of a lot more risky than the other but this is why we compre risk vs reward to determine worthy investments. 

And yes technically Football index is ‘gambling’ but it’s a so much closer to trading common stocks than an Acca imo

1945 2018-08-04 12:53:11 The quantity isn’t so much a problem considering there are still 3,800 of them and a portfolio doesn’t benefit from further diversification beyond 30 stocks.  So from an investor’s perspective, there is still plenty of choice.  The issue is if the quality has dropped...
1946 2018-08-04 12:52:34 Bury the NRA ....... the quicker the better.  Once they are gone, maybe we can affect some meaningful control of guns that still maintains the 2nd Amendment (i.e., no automatic assault rifles, large magazines and bump stocks, etc.)

1950 2018-08-04 12:49:31 Yes, indeed! 

In theory it sounds all soooo easy ... all financial books tout this:
Found a company, write a bestselling book, invent something, find your passion, buy real estate + rent it out, invest in stocks that yield a nice annual return, ...

All know it but who does it?

1956 2018-08-04 12:45:47 Yeah but gaining recognition is important for our scene to grow/evolve and it honestly seems to pay off with all the progress we‘ve made over the last years. 2 stocks is still balanced enough to have it as a compromise between viewers and players so I think it‘s fine.

1965 2018-08-04 12:36:10 I know what you’re thinking, Nick: making $ on penny stocks. Where’s John Rockefeller’s shoeshine boy?
1966 2018-08-04 12:34:44 Yes Michael this is a very common theme

$Apple traded for $1 & $Amazon for $6 & $Microsoft for only $20 post Dot Com Boom

Eventually the frontline IT stocks recovered 50-200x but most penny stocks of that era died

1967 2018-08-04 12:31:54 "An authority on common stocks has recently defined an investment as any purchase made with the intention of holding it for a year or more; but this definition is admittedly suggested by its convenience rather than its penetration."

1969 2018-08-04 12:29:17 IMHO, Jeong was programmed (educated) in the fine art of racist rhetoric, and was given an editorial job because she was the best in her class (however low that may be). As mainstream media continues to hire myopic magpies, their viewership, ratings, and stocks continue to fall.

1975 2018-08-04 12:21:49 I refer you to the graph we were doing quite well in this elitist club. Our fishermen wanted out so they could fish more. Under the EU Cod stocks were beginning to recover... Equality means everyone gets treated the same.
1976 2018-08-04 12:19:29 To bad for them
You always get rewarded for owning the best.
But just like penny stocks, ppl will just become seperated from their money...

1986 2018-08-04 12:07:17 I think this is misrepresentation of data. I think what the data say is that if you exclude the top 200 most profitable comps, then the rest of the stock mkt has no earnings in aggregate. Still room for 1500 profitable stocks, except the last 1700 lose as much as the 1500 make.
1987 2018-08-04 12:06:30 No there hasn't been any gain for the poor & middle class. Real wages are in the toilet & they have no significant tax break.
It's common knowledge that companies used their tax breaks to buy back their stocks; they've admitted to doing so.

The best things to invest in when you have spending money is 1) Land 2) Real Estate. This is a far better investment than stocks and bonds.

1997 2018-08-04 11:58:11 3 stocks is better than 2 stocks in most cases imo. The problem is that there are a few characters that absolutely ruin 3 stocks like Sonic, Rosa and Bayo while the rest of the cast plays fine, but just because of these chars we have to play 2 stocks.

2011 2018-08-04 11:48:52 It is market which determine the value. Indicators of profitability will attract more ppl 2 buy its stocks, pushing prices of shares upward but fall in buying wud push prices of shares downward, the value wud go down. Your own wages is subject to ur market value.

2018 2018-08-04 11:44:16 Nah I don't. So far people have specified what they want or if they want a simple coloured/patterned BG for lower price. There's no stocks, though. Everything is done there and then.

Logic says sell up and move on. Loads of private investors have been dumping their stocks. Don't see institutional selling that's hit notifiable levels.

2210 2018-08-04 07:25:20 The rich paid taxes too in those days. But then they got smart and realized that lending money to the government was a better deal; they collect interest on bonds & dividends on bank stocks and keep funding governments that increase the debt.

2213 2018-08-04 07:16:05 If you're looking for dividend-paying stocks then make sure they have a history of paying dividends during recessions and bad times. If not, then they aren't as attractive.

2229 2018-08-04 06:57:38 I personally have ended up with a *loss* in pay. My employer is aggressively buying back stocks. They eliminated corporate mgmt positions, reduced store hours, raises, shift differentials, and labor costs to a mere 2% of total operating costs. They're not the only ones either.
2230 2018-08-04 06:57:10 This is also why the Stock Market is going up, with no EPA regulations, companies make more profits by polluting the air all they want. The stocks will collapse eventually and so will our planet.

2290 2018-08-04 05:47:49 Finna learn stocks. Period. Was supposed to do this a long time ago. No more procrastinating
2291 2018-08-04 05:46:20 and that included the massiv buyback due to "tax reform". Stocks should be a lot higher. If the major players (apple, google, amazon etc ) are taken out of the picture it looks even worse
2292 2018-08-04 05:45:25 As a rule of thumb you should not invest any money into stock market which you might need in the next 5 years.

2298 2018-08-04 05:30:39 PSU Banks offers good scope for appreciation in the short term. The Good PSU banks are  SBI,Indian Bank & Canara banks .
2299 2018-08-04 05:30:27 Yup the market viewed with a general yard stick is staring at a time or price correction. But there are plenty of fully valued stocks that will still give you superlative returns as their business show tremendous earnings growth.

2308 2018-08-04 05:13:26 The company's stocks dropped, fans gave up their tickets for Triple H recordings and fansigns, Pentagon has lost fans (on their fancafé I think?), and CLC and G(I)_DLE could be affected too. So sick of Korean fan culture ruining everything, tbh.

2314 2018-08-04 05:08:44 Yeah, no, I think you missed my point.

I was pointing out why Cuban's stock position is a dumb way to judge his investment in MoviePass.

He's not wrong that you pump $HMNY harder than a prom date though.
2315 2018-08-04 05:06:09 My conclusion
Invest small in low priced high risk stocks with strict stoploss when market is booming 

And create wealth so that you can buy delicious highpriced bluechips when market tanks
2316 2018-08-04 05:05:55 Yes, he was rather arrogant in dealing with other rulers. Suraj Mal did not walk out exactly, he was kept in the alliance by Holkar and Scindia, with whom he was on good terms. But the Jats did not give full fledged support, and most important cut off the food stocks.

2329 2018-08-04 04:44:40 You know very well every state is different. Cruz would still be able to obtain his 10 guns today just as he did over the year before the shooting. The only federal law that has been signed into place is on bump stocks & you know what fix NICS 2017 looked like originally.
2330 2018-08-04 04:43:14 I’m from MI and my target stocks LY Her and Tear
2331 2018-08-04 04:42:50 Actually I've reallocated my funds to stocks of companies that have committed to and are operating with social consciousness. YES! They are out there.
2332 2018-08-04 04:42:24 Any simple way for Indian residents to buy stocks in US market?
2333 2018-08-04 04:42:03 Bump stocks still legal
2334 2018-08-04 04:42:02 U r a software engineer .u design a sofware where stock crosses and closes above 2 day high...u filter it every day after 3.3...u will get list of stocks..vol should be above 3days average..u send me list..we will do intraday in that stocks on 3rd day
2335 2018-08-04 04:39:57 I think the left generally believes that secondary and tertiary residences of the rich are the cause of these shortages. Nevermind the fact that scarce housing stocks makes such super rich the only ones able to buy real estate.
2336 2018-08-04 04:39:43 spot on
2337 2018-08-04 04:39:08 To be clear, no stock market metrics are 100% reliable at predicting corrections, crashes, rallies, or stagnant stock markets. After all, if this were the case, wouldn't everyone know exactly when to buy, sell, and hold in order to maximize their profits?
2338 2018-08-04 04:38:33 That petition is a waste of time. Nothing will change until their stocks tank. Shareholders will either bail or clean house.
2339 2018-08-04 04:27:28 @Mavic I just bought a new set of road wheels and love them and the Yksion Pro UST tires. I need to replace a tire, but am having are hard time. Can you recommend a shop in Calgary Alberta that actually stocks tires?
2340 2018-08-04 04:25:19 The underlying dynamic of capitalism is the accumulation of surplus capital. Wage theft, speculation, war and crisis profiteering, shorting stocks... are all consist with the logic of the system.

2345 2018-08-04 04:20:36 Britt was running the shower for like 10 mins and I said hey we don’t own stocks in the water company. I’m getting old.
2346 2018-08-04 04:20:31 My grandfather being the dean of humanities Seattle Pacific University way back in the day, it's really is sort of pathetic, the echo chamber of idiocy, but everything changes, time moves on, the old stocks are ground into the dirt and become mulch for the new growth.

2348 2018-08-04 04:18:55 I love this. Also, I recommend everyone ask your HR person to make sure your 401k has an option for no gun stocks. They do it for tobacco. They can do it for guns, too

Are you just making shit up lol?
2352 2018-08-04 04:13:46 Awwwww. An unemployed lazy liberal, yapping his dentures. Trump is gaining even more support from all groups of people. Stocks are way up. Jobs, jobs, jobs!!! Communists like you will never win.
2353 2018-08-04 04:12:55 When everyone around you (including milkman, newspaper boy, college lecturers & even shoe-polisher) start talking of stocks, nifty and returns with over-over confidence.


2354 2018-08-04 04:11:40 Trump is a deranged, draft-dodging criminal who is supported by our enemies, and Hillary is somebody who makes Trumpers edgy for no real reason.

And the economy is in trouble. Stocks plunged, prices are up, and Trump is losing his idiotic trade war.
2355 2018-08-04 04:11:11 @Ninja is Jordan Belfort and @FortniteGame is penny stocks
2356 2018-08-04 04:11:03 Nifty and Nifty stocks trading like high beta stocks.. Everyday at least 50_60 points movement in index and at least one stock going up or down 5% with no cash market volume

2363 2018-08-04 03:57:52 Firstly I avoid cash scripts for trading.. I prefer 200 Fno Stocks check their demand (support zones on daily charts) make a positon based on price action and Trade.. India cement has good support area at 101-102 accumulate their with 3 RS SL and 115 tgt.. And which star??

2369 2018-08-04 03:53:50 The wall doesn’t stop it, build a wall, go long on boat stocks. Want to stop illegal immigration, go after the employers.
2370 2018-08-04 03:53:50 The wealthy do not become wealthier by investing in stocks, they get wealthier by investing in the imprisonment of the workers.
2371 2018-08-04 03:52:17 In consideration of all that is going well for every American it strains ones mind why 369,000 democrats want to vote against their betterment. Do they not have 401Ks tied to stocks? Do they not have friends and family working new jobs instead of collecting welfare? Do they not..
2372 2018-08-04 03:52:01 Our crazy Friday night has consisted of investing in a top notch cooler and discussing our stocks. Does this mean we’re adults?

2376 2018-08-04 03:45:22 Always a great idea for a franchise to draft and sign young players and develop them. Young ballers are like stocks: gotta have those investments for the future.

2382 2018-08-04 03:39:08 No, you don’t know how that works do you? House that where worth X amount one day were only worth Half that the next day. People lost equity, same with stocks which was people’s retirement, THE ECONOMY COLLAPSED. Some people may have got some money out but most lost out. -2 GDP
2383 2018-08-04 03:36:31 I really was happier when I had fewer different stocks.
2384 2018-08-04 03:36:05 It's not amusing. Their careers might be over. Stocks are dropping. Promotions cancelled. Dating can be career suicide.
2385 2018-08-04 03:35:49 Continue to be afraid to start that business, not getting that degree you thought about, go to that gym you always pass, not buying those stocks you were interested in, talking to that person you probably admire, and tell me in 20 years if you were living your best life 
2386 2018-08-04 03:32:47 Yep best tea bags ever!

2389 2018-08-04 03:32:15 Yes but in US and Europe- it's not career suicide. Stocks dropping for cube. Promotions have been halted for Triple H. Career could be over. Look AT Sungmin. Hopefully will have positive outcome but it's scary .

2397 2018-08-04 03:25:48 1) In your example, it'd be closer to calling yourself a "monarchist" than a "King".
2) I do own the "means of production" -- at least in part -- through stocks. My 401k invests in mutual funds which are simply pooled stocks. Stock = fractional ownership of a public company.

2399 2018-08-04 03:24:15 Yea totally agree with that. And they bought resource stocks and did hostile takeovers and got rekt. They did a lot of messy stuff with an insane cap structure 

But they had what appeared to be a systematic advantage in building and construction. Its possible

2406 2018-08-04 03:19:44 In stocks though, always subject to (proper) market correction.
2407 2018-08-04 03:19:09 Likewise, you can run a thousand statistical backtests that prove that you shouldn't sell your stocks when the market is going down, but when the market is plummeting down most people panic and sell their stocks anyway.
2408 2018-08-04 03:18:44 Anybody fw stocks ? I’m thinking about investing in a couple and would love to hear anyone’s opinions/experiences with it

2420 2018-08-04 03:07:12 Good!! It’s always a good idea to check on upcoming events on stocks like that. When they fall from grace, reverse splits are typically bad for all — they preclude extreme continued dilution and price collapse, with even less liquidity
2421 2018-08-04 03:06:53 GM and Ford are trying to eat the billion $ impacts. Stocks are down by 20%. If you have auto stocks or mutual funds you are nailed.

2448 2018-08-04 02:39:26 yes, good news for them and the Aussies, unfortunately, there's no pure play way to capture this arbitrage via stocks. @Shell @Total are too big of majors to reflect on their stock prices. I like $GLNG as a transportation play, but market doesn't agree
2449 2018-08-04 02:37:51 Most of these stocks have a book value many times share price. Bonavista has a book value of just over $6 & cash flow at $1.18 a share. Stock has a 4-cent dividend. They plummeted from $30 to $1.56 & finally consolidating trading sideways for the past couple years. Looks primed.

2459 2018-08-04 02:29:51 @CarpeNoctom Do you also trades stocks? If you do, do you use Nasdaq?
2460 2018-08-04 02:29:30 We can't exactly hold Ripple stocks and something tells me they won't ever have an IPO. The are sitting on 100s of billions if not trillions of USD value. No need!
2461 2018-08-04 02:28:36 But maybe @jack will do what is right if he really sees how bad it is. Let's hope. His stocks will continue to fall if they don't.

2468 2018-08-04 02:19:52 All that matters is price action. I think you are going to be right, but I am not sure where the stocks drops FROM.
2469 2018-08-04 02:18:35 Yeah because government does things so well....Look, you want government to be a sugar daddy, go for it. I ain't paying for it. I'll expat out before I get my accounts raided by socialist parasites.

2480 2018-08-04 02:05:30 Mark is an ayaanle who trades stocks -- but only at night.
2481 2018-08-04 02:05:12 JD is awesome & highly undervalued right now IMO. I used to have BABA at $60 but sold at $90 (fml) lol. But yeah man, I just don't rly like F, plus I feel like it hasn't moved in like the last 2yrs haha. I like the tech oriented stocks a lot & bio is my personal specialty/fave.
2482 2018-08-04 02:02:20 Broke: trading stocks whose values come from explotation (Walmart) or human misery ( Lockheed)
Woke: trading value between imaginary intangible cryptos
2483 2018-08-04 02:01:35 Haha I’m not involved in whatever you guys have going on...only thing I would say is Ellie...you know what Quality OTC stocks are...this stock and how it is being moved isn’t quality and is bad for the OTC and it’s image...stick to the quality like I know you do. 
2484 2018-08-04 02:00:03 Mainly you lie, using day to day stocks fluctuation and voluntarily ignoring the tendencies as any low business acumen #fakeNews outlet do.
2485 2018-08-04 01:59:05 I can't wait to see Smash Ultimate with stocks instead of time

2489 2018-08-04 01:57:08 Yes but they are not climbing Everest  daily and managing a business and building a family like most of us. The sherpas who accompany hikers in Asia look like bean stocks and are strong. Managed lives.
2490 2018-08-04 01:56:58 And Trump will win even bigger! Job growth,  stocks up, taxes lower, GDP beat ever! No evidence just resists.

2493 2018-08-04 01:53:11 I'd think there's more than one - how they select stocks, how they invest, what skills they have, what they see as growth industries, how they manage their businesses, how they build their empire & ensure generational wealth... I'd be seeking legal and financial tools & knowhow.

2497 2018-08-04 01:44:49 I rly love trading SPY... Especially lately, almost been too damn easy haha. I hate the high IV stocks tho.
2498 2018-08-04 01:44:48 I know. And Pentagon is so talented. It's heartbreaking. Stocks Down. Triple H activities cancelled.
2499 2018-08-04 01:43:55 Some but more stocks
2500 2018-08-04 01:43:34 its just really blowing my mind that fansites closed, triple h cancelled promotions, and cube stocks dropped after all of this. literally wtf? all because two people like each other? its so sad :(
2501 2018-08-04 01:42:45 I’m physically challenged & my bro also had health issues (1 of the reasons we were initially denied entry to ). Nonetheless we both finished college/university. My bro worked w/stocks. I’ve been elementary teacher for 15 yrs. We fought discrimination everyday & succeed!
2502 2018-08-04 01:41:37 We short semi fab stocks perhaps
2503 2018-08-04 01:41:29 So mostly trading individual stocks, not indexes such as SPY or QQQ, etc...?

2507 2018-08-04 01:39:45 $TNDM AND $HEAR These 2 stocks skyrocketed before my own eyes. Just kicking myself for not picking up a 1000 shares each back in March when it was trading at $1.98 ($HEAR) during a reverse split. (TNDM$) trading at $3.43.  These are my babies for the long play. It’s never to late

2512 2018-08-04 01:37:54 It didn't even seem like she had that much, her turnovers was so silly.. I just don't see how Stocks doesn't just play everyone. You have nothing to lose
2513 2018-08-04 01:35:35 The only thing that prevents me from doing so sometimes is that literally no one around me stocks the books from my favorite author so I have to order online.

2521 2018-08-04 01:29:09 Both but preferring options recently with the limbo market. But majority of my experience is stocks.
2522 2018-08-04 01:28:47 When you flip stocks and own businesses you don't need followers to get paid
2523 2018-08-04 01:26:47 some companies worry about their stocks and sales bc some fans actually dont buy merch or albums anymore just bc their faves are taken. thats why some implement dating bans for like 2-3 yrs until theyre stable enough. i personally dont get why fans get entitled like smh no,,,

2537 2018-08-04 01:12:50 With the recent swoon in crude oil prices many top energy stocks, like Marathon Oil (MRO), have broken down, triggering sell signals and falling through key support levels.
2538 2018-08-04 01:12:43 The DOW isn't an indicator of regular folks' economic benefit. Most Americans don't own stocks on corporate boards. Many aren't seeing higher wages - they're seeing healthcare costs soar, wiping out any benefit from the tax cut. Crap schools, budgets cut, $1.5 trillion wasted. 
2539 2018-08-04 01:12:21 Having the right broker is important for shorting, i feel like etrade and td are like blue chip stocks minus dividends, they juat dont give you much growth potential
2540 2018-08-04 01:12:20 Round 1 lost 0-4 stocks. There's always losers!

2542 2018-08-04 01:09:27 Among IBD's 197 industry groups, consumer electronics, personal care and cosmetics, RV maker, gaming software and airline stocks did well with gains of 1.5% or more. Food and fiber optic stocks also led the market advance.
2543 2018-08-04 01:09:17 fundamental analysis on Enron of course did work even better than TA. apart from that, one perfect case among 100,000+ stocks, does not prove a technique is valuable. success.

2546 2018-08-04 01:07:13 Nit the biggest GDP by far, how much had u lost with trade wars? I didnt see any money I must not make enough for a golden parachute.  The rich got richer and companies bought stocks. U r a monumental disgrace. Good thing u can't read cuz rhe history books r gonna eat u alive
2547 2018-08-04 01:06:56 I wish we could just pump out sterile chinook stocks from hatcheries just for the feeding purpose til a better plan comes along.
2548 2018-08-04 01:06:38 All he has done is frontload stocks and then pump it and dump his worthless shares on the unsuspecting buyers who believe his bs. You do know your days are #d before the feds come knocking right?
2549 2018-08-04 01:04:25 I do not no, i could look into it though. Alot of stocks like this one where people are impatient. Similar to $SGTN

2557 2018-08-04 00:59:48 Wow, how elitist a spin that is.  Regular people dont have stocks is that what you are implying because this union member manufacturing brazer  401k has literally doubled since Jan. Maybe you should get one too.
2558 2018-08-04 00:59:26 Unfortunately, Amazon does not ship to Australia anymore, so it’s harder to find Thomas merch I feel. Many other sites are too expensive and Aus stores don’t really have the most updated stocks. I’ve also been trying to find affordable sites but it’s hard.
2559 2018-08-04 00:58:06 That is a well quoted remark by President Obama.  Sure, let 's see your unemployment figures.  The Wall  Street Journal would take great exception to your fake figures.

Seriously doubt these grafts.  I read too much financial news and my stocks are booming today! Under Obama 0.
2560 2018-08-04 00:55:40 And so
“it’s a lot to worry about. It doesn’t necessarily mean calamity is just ahead. For all we know, stocks could resume rising or even “melt up,” ... The economy may well grow impressively this year. But we don’t have to look much further out to get more nervous.”
2561 2018-08-04 00:54:57 @RobinhoodApp I just started investing in stocks and I'm so happy with the layout of the app.
2562 2018-08-04 00:54:33 Most valuable items, including stocks are expensive  but in this world you always get opportunities  to buy right and right price and then it's for you to sit tight  over it! Remember  MO
2563 2018-08-04 00:53:59 But
“Trying to call turns in the market is folly, and there’s no telling how stocks might perform in the next six or 12 months. Even if today’s prices are in fact far too high, the market need not plunge. It could just stagnate until profits eventually catch up with prices.”
2564 2018-08-04 00:52:42 Wait until you make $200-300 in a day and lose it in 15 minutes as the market swings (by the way, don’t check stocks every day...they will drive you crazy...every week, two or month once you get your portfolio balanced)

2572 2018-08-04 00:43:08 With all due respect Greg I disagree. I see the market cap of BND is $36B and it moved .08 today, meanwhile Apple’s market cap is $1T and it moved $1.71 and FB imat .5T moved $1.41 today. That’s why I said money was flowing out of small caps and back into growth stocks.

2593 2018-08-04 00:26:55 Lets see the idiot brags about economic growth rate of 4.1% when many economists say otherwise, more like 2.7%.

2606 2018-08-04 00:14:32 The slope of commodities versus stocks tends to decline at a rate roughly equal to productivity in the economy.  In other words, your total return in the S&P = dividends + nominal/inflation + real/productivity
2607 2018-08-04 00:13:47 Stopped watching Fast Money with BK the cryptocurrency snake oil salesman, Dan the Debbie downer on stocks, and the firing of Rich Ross who hurt Dan’s fragile feelings after he insulted Rich who is an excellent chartist and a top CNBC options trader. Sad!

2613 2018-08-04 00:09:04 Im raising a few thousands for myself to play stocks, fairly low profile right now make it grow. Mostly trying to finish up the Restorative Armor, Trollhunters.
2614 2018-08-04 00:03:46 Dude, there is no minimum buy in to the stock market. Once you have a little savings cushion in case of emergency, start paying in to a 401(k) or a Vanguard account. Buy a tracker or target retirement fund so you don’t have to pick stocks or pay Wall St advisors.
2615 2018-08-04 00:03:24 What no one wants to hear is that if that murderer couldn’t get those guns and the accessories like bump stocks this massacre wouldn’t have happened.

2653 2018-08-03 23:29:24 After the money raising function of stocks is accomplished, they become only a vehicle for gambling. Shareholders only care for current profit. I saw a company destroyed by greedy CEO trying to make his profit for the quarter to please the shareholders.
2654 2018-08-03 23:28:19 Wow a drug company is increasing its stocks by four weeks...... That's it I am cancelling Brexit. FGS have a word with yourself

Me: Maybe the CEO’s are getting paid too much.

Financial news: This will forever be a mystery
2663 2018-08-03 23:20:39 @bizrpt Isn’t is scary that is it 40% maybe more of the SMP is composed of only about 5 stocks? & the stock market reflects Big investors on one end & our retirements on the other it’s not for the little speculators any more. It would be fun though to have $$ & time to play

2677 2018-08-03 23:11:29 Its worse than that, Gaby. Stocks are in no way a representation of a companies strengths or long term prospects. It is strictly a gambling game.

Stagnate, get weak, have quick sell offs, not hold strength, and diverge from the 2 closest and equivalent stocks.
2680 2018-08-03 23:08:38 What company stocks are you snapping right now that you think you’ll be tweeting in ~40 years?
2681 2018-08-03 23:08:25 I’m sorry that’s wrong. Lots of middle class people have their retirement ties into stocks. Wait, what happened in 2008? #TYTLive
2682 2018-08-03 23:05:32 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１３１
2683 2018-08-03 23:05:23 That's because we haven't reached late stage capitalism yet. But when Amazon exploits it's workers to generate record profits, when Apple reaches 1 trillion dollars in stocks while factory workers are suffering, then the system clearly doesn't work the way it should.
2684 2018-08-03 23:04:22 There goes United Airline Stocks
2685 2018-08-03 23:03:20 Toto's 'Africa' is on every F'n station! Did I time travel? Is it 1982? If so I'm getting some stocks for baby me's shower!
2686 2018-08-03 23:03:13 Most of the tax break money was used by corporations to buy back stocks. 4 million (if that is even true) isn’t many compared to how many people work in the US. Oh and what will they spend that $1.25 on? Gas, because prices are getting ready to go up because of YOU. #TRE45ON
2687 2018-08-03 23:02:58 How many times have you taken a stock tip from a buddy or an email or a TV expert and lost most of your investment?  How many times has it made you a profit?  #investing #personalfinance #trading #stocks #StockMarket #retirement

2691 2018-08-03 22:56:08 $pkg.c is my favourite penny play right now. Good leadership, growing revenues, deal with Amazon and impending news of national expansion - great fundamentals. Also, with most CSE stocks sliding into the toilet this summer, $pkg.c has held strong. Great potential.
2692 2018-08-03 22:55:46 I still have the feeling that #spx is moving closer to 3.000...I have a small put as portfolio protection and will sell many stocks close between 2.855 and 2.990 and then build up the small put....

2698 2018-08-03 22:45:04 What does that chart look like on a total return basis? Value stocks have higher dividends
2699 2018-08-03 22:44:24 It won't be long, just watch the stocks tank. FB shareholders are already calling for Zuckerburg to be ousted lol
2700 2018-08-03 22:41:43 Liquidity includes investments that are accessible like an IRA or stocks. 

I'm not pretending to know exactly how the NFL does it but in every franchise agreement I've reviewed, they have a very distinct separation between operating capital & trust as required by statute.

2703 2018-08-03 22:35:54 Judges nominated to the bench by an illegitimate president should be removed when Trump is booted from the White House.

2717 2018-08-03 22:29:06 I thought the car seat was Dad's right arm. I used to ride with my dad to test his street stocks. Held onto the roll cage.
2718 2018-08-03 22:28:24 True, balance cash flow. I have 20k shares in $auph. I will daytrade/ swing trade or invest in other stocks. I have enough cash in $auph, with expectation of enough ROI.

2721 2018-08-03 22:26:28 Margins are cyclical (& by definition so r E & CF) Margins at historic highs. Cant just extrapolate last 10 years of E & CF growth rates (GFC to boom). Furthermore, extrapolating them requires doubling the RF rate which moves with GDP growth rate (what will 4-5% RF do to stocks?)
2722 2018-08-03 22:25:50 The slight difference is that Apple’s Stocks app received (probably still does) these values as a formatted string from the crappy Yahoo! API, rather than a number.

2726 2018-08-03 22:23:28 Dear @FoxBusiness 
I watch @cvpayne to get info and prognostication related to STOCKS - not to get vacuous political punditry. Quit navel gazing and get to stock analysis!
I’m going back to the @jimcramer rerun. Even if I have seen it before I can learn something. FFS.

2731 2018-08-03 22:19:53 I don't think Cooper's for banning dividends, just regulating them. IDK about you but most of the money I've made on stocks comes from increased valuation, not dividends...
2732 2018-08-03 22:19:42 I know stocks dropped, people shitting on the lads group and closing fansites/cancelling tickets but honestly how can you call yourself a fan if you’re going to act that petty. Idec they’ll still have supporters and they’re still(ish) rookies so they have time to grow
2733 2018-08-03 22:18:47 Will crush you with my stocks and bonds. if it's alone.
2734 2018-08-03 22:18:18 I’m starting to work on a thank you letter to all of the $HMNY Bears that helped us get shares and the $.05 range today.

2745 2018-08-03 22:05:40 Do you trade mostly stocks or options?
2746 2018-08-03 22:05:40 That's what I was trying to say essentially.  It has been weird how energy stocks have sold off hard into earnings even though the reports have generally been good. I can't figure it out.
2747 2018-08-03 22:05:37 I know, I’m genuinely shocked I thought even if they were limited edition, stocks would last at least for a few days?

2749 2018-08-03 22:01:06 So far, executives have used the cuts for half $T on stock buy backs, which of course raises share prices. They are compensated in corporate stocks so instead of investing in expansion, they are increasing their pay. While many of us own some stocks, 1% own 50%. A bit lopsided.
2750 2018-08-03 22:00:36 I wonder How many police were killed by bump stocks 30 round mags or lack of back round checks .
2751 2018-08-03 21:59:50 @stockpigeon just wondering what program would you recommend for screening stocks for swing trades and/or day trades? I appreciate any information.  Thanks

2757 2018-08-03 21:55:31 Margin debt declined in June as speculators have started to reduce their exposure to equity markets. Late in a bull market, speculators step up borrowing on margin so they can buy more stocks to take advantage of expected gains going forward.
2758 2018-08-03 21:53:50 a savings account linked to my primary checking does me absolutely no good. my savings are my 401k, stocks & CD’s. out of sight, out of mind.

I'll be covering this topic in short Tweet-sized formats over the next few weeks.
2761 2018-08-03 21:51:27 We issued our new Investment Playbook this week. We carefully considered pulling back our Overweight to US stocks, and in particular, Small caps. However, as long as $SPY $IWM EPS est trends remain on an improving path, we elected to stay the course. Too many unjustified fears.
2762 2018-08-03 21:51:04 In the US finance is about 2% of employment, and that includes lower level positions like clerks and bank tellers.

For S&P stocks, more than 18% of earnings are now going to financial stocks.  That number has been as high as 40% (2008) and over 30% several other years.
2763 2018-08-03 21:47:26 @lidlfrance finit de vendre ses stocks qui se retrouveront en partie dans la nature, mais c'est pas grave, il n'aura pas fait de pertes sur ses produits en plastique.
2764 2018-08-03 21:46:53 US stocks widened their lead over international stocks this week. YTD, the $SPY is outperforming $EFA by +935 bps & $EEM by +1,241 bps. Further, small cap US stocks $IWM are doing even better outperforming $EFA by +1,209 bps & $EEM by +1,516 bps YTD.
2765 2018-08-03 21:46:18 *ding* IDEA! This is the PERFECT excuse to get in vast stocks of Stolichnaya - for use as  anaesthetic of course. Ahem.
2766 2018-08-03 21:45:30 You getting closer to buying individual stocks again? Curious what would trigger that situation
2767 2018-08-03 21:44:42 Then Apple becomes the first U.S company to hit One trillion dollar value #stocks #Apple1trillion
2768 2018-08-03 21:41:48 I think stocks with some sticky rubber would have looked better.....unless you're pulling some hotboy @theRealTavarish stuff
2769 2018-08-03 21:41:22 Now cut that out. Folks are going to be certain you're psychic. By the way, been thinking of any particular stocks lately?  
2770 2018-08-03 21:40:52 an interesting observation in the next stock market correction will be to see to what extent the performance of the S&P500 differs from the performance of an equally weighted index of S&P500 stocks, might give some insight into whether ETFs distort markets or not
2771 2018-08-03 21:40:34 After the Bell: Stocks Steamroll Tariff and Job Worries to End Higher ...
2772 2018-08-03 21:40:16 That said, and considering that the US$ is not the only and not the smallest-per-unit currency in the world, is anyone surprised the iOS Stocks app handled T well years ago? Apple was a Trillion-Italian-Lira company, back when the the Stocks app launched with the iPhone in 2007.
2773 2018-08-03 21:37:56 It has to be Life In The Stocks @mattstocksdj
2774 2018-08-03 21:37:39 You havnt seen our record breaking economy. Record number off welfare, record unemployment, record stocks
2775 2018-08-03 21:37:20 Since 2/8/18, the S&P 500 is up +10.1% & the Russell 2000 +14.3%. We upgraded US stocks to overweight on 2/6/18 & told clients to go small over large. We made that decision based on unjustified fear and our measurement of sustainable positive $SPY earnings estimate trends. $IWM
2776 2018-08-03 21:35:51 For some reason, the stocks out at me as the belief I was most deceived about. I legit thought the smaller government thing was at least somewhat sincere.
2777 2018-08-03 21:35:01 happy i stayed on sidelines in the gamer stocks today $atvi $ea $ttwo next week you’re mine
2778 2018-08-03 21:34:41 #TLAND already 10x.

Still very New & very Cheap = 0.10 satoshi only. Fill ur Bags

APPLIED FOR CMC LISTING TODAY. 

Website & Whitepaper to be released soon. Stocks Exchange listing ( coming soon )

Price should be 5x soon

2779 2018-08-03 21:33:27 I'll put $100 into $HMNY when it hits $0.01. Pure gamble, but still more likely to win than the lottery. Betting on a buyback after this heavy dilution, and somehow dodging bankruptcy. The crappy stocks I used to hold on to have 10m market caps, so they may have a chance
2780 2018-08-03 21:32:42 Given that everything is expensive, does value investing still work? It’s one thing to buy the cheapest stocks on a P/E of 7, but now they’re on a P/E of 12-15. Where’s the margin of safety? 
2781 2018-08-03 21:31:18 The stock split 4x in total or since the BW cover story? 1st split was in 80s but cover dates from 97. Stocks isn’t my area but trying to understand this - which is fascinating btw. I’m pretty sure I had $100 sitting around back then...
2782 2018-08-03 21:30:49 @Flora do you still make the Coconut and Almond, and Avocado oil and Lime Flora Freedom? 
The one Sainsbury's I used to buy it from in Manchester no longer stocks it  we love it and want to be able to buy again..
2783 2018-08-03 21:30:01 The #markets are unforgiving, and emotional #trading always results in losses. #forex #stocks
2784 2018-08-03 21:29:26 Huh!  I only found 2 red Xs to block today. Depleted stocks I assume is the issue.
2785 2018-08-03 21:29:02 Would you discuss pipeline stocks? Thanks!!
2786 2018-08-03 21:27:59 I think the point they are trying to make is flow of funds into stocks in indices vs the broader market that is less indexed.What happens to correlation of stocks within an index vs the wider market in the next sell off. How do stocks such as MSFT behave that are in many ETFs?
2787 2018-08-03 21:27:22 Now a days the rise and fall of stocks are not made from earnings. Instead moving in and moving out of ASM keeps the prices up and down.
2788 2018-08-03 21:26:48 Quantify hard work. I am middle class and lazy a fuck. I trade stocks and Play fortnight. Hard work is the lie you tell poor people

2790 2018-08-03 21:25:45 Wouldn't boost stock market? Okay, we got a GDP of 4.1%, stocks breaking record high with unemployment rates of 3.9% the lowest in decades but I do respect your opinion. 

We do have a very unpopular asshole of a president but his methods seems to work as described above.......

2794 2018-08-03 21:20:26 The 2nd Amndmt was written without the existence of semi-automatic and automatic rifles and bump stocks.
2795 2018-08-03 21:19:59 Anyone think it’s kinda confusing how the $HMNY Bears always demand good #news; when good news arrives they then “sell the news” and dump quickly to scare everyone, in part to try to make the #stock look like a pump n dump? 

 CHEAPER STOCK DOES NOT SCARE ME AWAY
2796 2018-08-03 21:19:55 Nothing is going to change here until stocks tank and shareholders either bail or clean house. Crying about being Shadow banned is pointless because non-followers can't see you.
2797 2018-08-03 21:19:43 And he calculates it from a few portfolios like US_Stocks, EM_Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, not from individual stocks.
2798 2018-08-03 21:18:36 @Baircave smokes   since deep stocks !!   
2799 2018-08-03 21:16:58 Hi Kathy Mc - You may be able to sell off stocks/stock funds in your IRA/401K next week, & reinvest in some kind of cash fund - probably paying only 1-2%, but you'd preserve stock market gains, and maybe gain FDIC-insurance.  You can maybe do this within the IRA/401K.
2800 2018-08-03 21:16:31 it's easy saying that you'll support the idols even they come out and say they're dating, you yourself know that a good amount in the fandom will drop them and the agency's stocks will start decreasing.
majority of us are very okay with celebs dating but in korea, it's different.
2801 2018-08-03 21:15:52 Where stocks this fine Italian tipple?
2802 2018-08-03 21:15:19 $SPY higher today on light volume, bought some puts into the close, 06AUG18 $283's for $0.35. liked the risk to reward potential so well see how that works out. Have a great weekend everyone!!

2806 2018-08-03 21:12:02 You trading penny stocks mostly? How does the room seem for them or small account s?

2809 2018-08-03 21:08:08 loving the can do attitude
2810 2018-08-03 21:08:01 Thats great advice tho while trading many stocks especially faang I keep an eye on what the $SPY is doing
2811 2018-08-03 21:07:04 Good. America does not need a Russian conduit to finance select political leaders, and stonewall even meager gun control legislation like making bump stocks illegal.
2812 2018-08-03 21:06:01 Who got laid off at Facebook? And I would not be so sure, there are plenty of stories of stock brokers jumping out of buildings bc of falling stocks. Extreme, but it is common for people put some savings in the stock market to help retire. if those stocks go down, it’s bad news
2813 2018-08-03 21:05:54 Now that the game isnt "who can chain as many true combos as possible" the pacing would be real nice with 3 stocks. Apparently it's gonna be more reactionary- thats what im hoping for anyhow.

It always sucks to be stuck in bayonetta Up Bs. Can't do anything about it.
2814 2018-08-03 21:05:31 Its all about carbon credits, another commodity that Al Gore and the DemoRats wanted to control so that they could buy and sell them like stocks world wide. Another way of raping the emerging countries of their gold and cash!

2823 2018-08-03 21:01:26 But that was money they could afford to lose. Also when stocks crash the workers tend to get laid off which hurts the workers. CEOs get severance packages, and investors still have a lot of money anyway.

2832 2018-08-03 20:59:35 If true, they are psychics and could be richer doing something else, like speculating on FB stocks or lottery numbers. Geez...

2838 2018-08-03 20:48:30 He's right. If Trump is truly for prison reform, then why are private prison stocks increasing? People are being sent to jail (right or wrong) for profit. If he passed legislation to end the drug war and decrease incarceration, then we'd know this meeting was in good faith.
2839 2018-08-03 20:47:05 Just some ideas of what I’m seeing and why I bought! Always risky to buy stocks that Wall Street is throwing out off “bad earnings” but great rvr
2840 2018-08-03 20:46:31 Band just announced they are low on stocks of their hand-made CD, so I guess they spent months very precisely making pits with a high energy laser and should really be charging more than a fiver.
2841 2018-08-03 20:45:30 Smart Global Holdings has turned out to be a complete bust and I’m just hanging onto it because I’m too stubborn to cut my losses, any chance it turns around? #SGH $SGH #SmartGlobalHoldings #Stocks #DJIA #Badinvestment #notsosmart #Market
2842 2018-08-03 20:44:45 Stop being intentionally ignorant.
Banning all bump stocks and other similar devices will reduce the rapid fire automatic like attacks.
Maybe give their mass victims time to get away or hide. 
Or do you enjoy the fact that innocent people are dying?

2860 2018-08-03 20:33:25 I gave you another example. You calling stocks in a bubble. Same source. The idea is that what you see is what the masses see. If the masses see it, they will act like you feel you should act. There will be a time when everyone will get bullish on stocks. Exit then.

2864 2018-08-03 20:32:00 One thing I have learned through years of trading stocks. Do the opposite of what they are saying to the masses.
2865 2018-08-03 20:32:00 Less than 24 hours after going public with their relationship and Cube has had a 3% drop in stocks. People really packing up their toys and going home because two grown ass adults were lucky enough to fall in love in this crazy dumpster fire of a world? Sad.

2882 2018-08-03 20:19:23 Yes Jason we most certainly are on the same page.....if the bull run emulates 2011 or possibly even 2007 then who cares IMO stocks including #URA will be 10 baggers plus, URA just diversify's the risk . DYOR I believe we could see increases that mirror recent Bitcoin surges.

2888 2018-08-03 20:14:30 Cool! Just be sure to make sure you are at 90% stocks or higher for the long term, since that should be a better long term return than a mix with higher bonds.

2895 2018-08-03 20:12:51 @CNBC @BobPisani The loss of stock splits is a real detriment to the retail investor. I rarely buy stocks >$100/shr.
2896 2018-08-03 20:12:11 My stocks sure don't say that.
2897 2018-08-03 20:10:52 Can you do this adjecuted calculation for me?
Take out every exchange token-bc there are basically stocks in different forms.
2898 2018-08-03 20:10:34 Stocks rise: Dow 25,462.58 +136.42/0.54%, Nasdaq +0.12%, S&P +0.46%. Dow 5day +0.05%, 1mo +4.11%, 3mo +4.95%, YTD +3.01%, 1yr +15.25%.
2899 2018-08-03 20:09:47 World  stocks ex Asia higher: Europe +.7%; US +.5%.  Ok economic data was enough to counterbalance unsettling trade tension between US & China. Today's week's up & down market behavior shows why it's futile to invest now for short-term. Best to stick to a solid long-term plan.
2900 2018-08-03 20:09:06 @BobPisani @CNBCClosingBell
I try not to buy any stocks that are over $25 a share. until the day comes when you can trade fractional shares then it would change. $1,200 for one share it's only have to buy it once and sell it once.

2905 2018-08-03 20:03:28 My banks and retail stocks are on fire and have been outperforming the markets.
2906 2018-08-03 20:03:20 Good graph. But as stocks tend to turn before recessions and employment also precede downturns, what is the average time-lag there?

2908 2018-08-03 20:02:26 Me too, and I am starting to wonder if I need to let this breathe and our chance is still ahead. Stocks that have momentum, regardless of fundamentals can be very painful.
2909 2018-08-03 20:01:59 Jason, I & many others have benefited in #URA selling down, I hold URA as part of a balanced portfolio including virtually all stocks they sold. It is still the only #Uranium & Nuclear component ETF worldwide & I believe a benchmark still for public sentiment IMO it will rally

2917 2018-08-03 19:57:03 Short term price moves are nothing more than a ‘random walk’. Focus on long-term.  Took me years to figure out but it’s made all the difference #stocks #investing

3040 2018-08-03 18:43:46 To be fair, it is nearly always reported this way, that numbers met, exceeded or fell short of expectations.  It’s because stocks are traded based on the expectations so this reporting helps explain why there may be a reaction in stock prices based on the real number

3107 2018-08-03 17:59:19 @JohnFlannery_GE the stocks stagnant. Get out and be seen. You’re not just a bean counter anymore you have to keep the public’s imagination, you have to be part entertainer. Donate to the victims of the California fires or something. The stock ALWAYS WATCH THE STOCK.

3112 2018-08-03 17:57:10 Even after $TSLA rocketed up to $350/share, the September 21 call options show a 30 delta for the $400 call.  So I sold the 400/420 call spread for a $3 CR. It would have to increase 14.3% to touch that level.  #OptionsTrading #investing #trading #stocks

3117 2018-08-03 17:54:37 My average in this stock is 2.70 $TNDM Been doing this for 20 years and never tried anything like this. I'm bagholding a lot of other stocks. Patience is the key..... sometimes.....
3118 2018-08-03 17:54:31 If you pay $16,000 in cash then you don't get to invest that $16,000. That money is gone, only thing left is the item you bought. If you invest that $16,000 in stocks/bonds are whatever you're going to earn back at least 6%. As long as you're loan is below 6% you're making money.
3119 2018-08-03 17:53:52 Great returns on bonds.Great returns on stocks.Very dynamic corporate sector.Oh,and that government debt thing? Nothing to worry about;that's just old people's hope for retirement funds. P.S:I have a turkey on the line who says the last three years have been FAT! What could go...
3120 2018-08-03 17:53:08 Stronger background checks. Red flag laws. Safe storage regulations. Ban bump stocks. No conceal carry reciprocity. No Stand Your Ground. No arming teachers. More guns will not make us safer.

3124 2018-08-03 17:51:33 It was running even when in ASM, hence not much impact. Even the last 6 months the price hardly corrected, infact they kept on appreciating. Hence not much movement. Smart money moving to stocks like #Rain and #Goa which corrected a lot.

3130 2018-08-03 17:48:29 What? He encouraged rallied support and refused to veto a tax scam bill that hurts everyone but the top 1% within 5 years but gives corporations permanent cuts when they all admitted all they'd do with the money is buy back stocks hurting average Americans ability to invest
3131 2018-08-03 17:48:23 Should’ve invested in Striker Corp. stocks when I had the chance....

3133 2018-08-03 17:47:07 Jan 26th was my portfolio's peak valuation. My target was then to hold onto gains until end of year. Not gonna happen!

Chinese stocks and worldwide financials banks falls did the original damage months ago.

Now the smaller UK focussed investors feeling bear market effect here.
3134 2018-08-03 17:46:53 @canusehand @uptickdntick stocks bounce.   Stocks trending lower have rallies.
3135 2018-08-03 17:44:31 Semi auto, not Automatic. Please don’t add to the hysteria. The incident was tragic enough. However, the use of bump stocks did *simulate* automatic weapon behavior, and why those haven’t already been banned is down to the spinelessness of our legislators esp those who vowed to.
3136 2018-08-03 17:43:59  stocks and investing is so lucrative. I need to read into more but damn you can hold onto a stock for years and make 10x what you put in.
3137 2018-08-03 17:43:44 Feeling ko it's not good to buy stocks now. Medyo hindi ako natutuwa sa review ko about sa nangyayare sa economics ngayon.
3138 2018-08-03 17:43:12 when my stocks are down and feeling sad, i check $hmny and i feel a lot better (of course i'm not sure about their future, though - i hope current shareholders can make up their loss somehow)
3139 2018-08-03 17:42:47 With more and more evidence contributing to the truth about the decline of wild salmon stocks isn't it time Alexandra Morton just packed her bags and headed home to Conneticut USA ?
3140 2018-08-03 17:42:46 $M has made tremendous strides this year, besides it has a fair P/E ratio compared to the elevated valuation in $AMZN. $M also has an attractive dividend yield. Management is going a good job, they should start share buybacks before the stocks gets too high.I also like $KOR $TIFF
3141 2018-08-03 17:41:32 And he was bearish on all the FAANG stocks the whole way up!   He was bullish on blackberry and YRCW....what a stock picking genius....lol....and he blocked me....gee, I wonder why! :)

3143 2018-08-03 17:41:06 No bump stocks - no high capacity magazines. Sensible gun regulation.  How is that coming for your guns?
3144 2018-08-03 17:39:55 As vacation stocks spiral, Piper Jaffray technician picks a travel stock to buy and one to avoid ...
3145 2018-08-03 17:39:48 I want to talk stocks/bonds, IRA, generational wealth, etc. Those things excite me too.
3146 2018-08-03 17:39:20 U.S. stocks mixed mid-afternoon Friday,08/03/18. $DJIA +0.36% at 25,416.99, $SPX +0.25% at 2,834.35, $COMPQ -0.12% at 7,792.94, $RUT -0.72% at 1670.03.
3147 2018-08-03 17:39:10 Midcap stocks are not performing , they are down by 20% - 30% so the gain is not visiable in your portfolio.
3148 2018-08-03 17:38:56 I still in paper Trading felling a little frustrated for the Market environment and the price action/charts of the penny stocks. But at least I practice everyday, cutting losses quickly and try to pick the best setups. @timothysykes
3149 2018-08-03 17:38:53 I swear everyone is getting into $SIC $SIC.V to make up for losses in pot stocks, or maybe that's just me
3150 2018-08-03 17:38:52 How long you think that will take?  im thinking maybe 7.75 by next week or so
3151 2018-08-03 17:37:49 Mais Macron et son Gouvernement ont pensé à toi !

3152 2018-08-03 17:37:31 cult stocks ruin accounts
3153 2018-08-03 17:37:30 Bud we know stocks yet
3154 2018-08-03 17:36:51 Most Penny Stocks fail, It’s good to know that. So yo can avoid believe in any of them and play safe like @timothysykes. At the same time when you have a small account you can’t short sell and the odds of success on the long side are hard. Depends of you take advantage or not.
3155 2018-08-03 17:36:01 Market flat-ish, $XLP up 1.34% today, $IWM down growth stocks down.
3156 2018-08-03 17:35:40 I believe in quality plays..plays where the majority have the best chance of winning..if you don't like me talking bad about your stock then don't trade trash stocks and follow trash OTC traders and you won't have to worry about me..I have NEVER bashed a stock that has quality.
3157 2018-08-03 17:35:39 I know stocks and flows are fundamentally different, but it's crazy to think of $AAPLs market capitalization being almost equal to Mexico's 2016 GDP. If Mexico traded all of its goods and services produced during that year, it could purchase one Apple company.
3158 2018-08-03 17:35:22 $OKTA Once Okta breaks $50 it’s just a freefall. Sell if you have a profit in this. #stocks
3159 2018-08-03 17:35:22 people thinking  #hdfcamc is overpriced, look at stocks with similar characteristics (longevity of growth, brand, high ROCE, no capex requirement, debt-free) trade. eg: Nestle, britannia, HUL. IMO it should settle at 60-70x TTM
3160 2018-08-03 17:35:05 Their attention to detail with film stocks & filters to replicate whatever it is they're pastiching is spot on.
3161 2018-08-03 17:34:27 About 10 yrs ago, I wrote Brick's Guidelines to Penny Stocks. I found a copy exactly as I wrote it then and snipped it and put it up on my pinned tweet. No. 1 deals with "hearing". Amazing how things don't change. That's why I like hanging around @KickoStocks
3162 2018-08-03 17:33:50 I don't buy individual company stocks, because you get better results on average by just buying the whole index via an ETF (like Vanguard's VTI) or a robo-advisor (like Betterment)
3163 2018-08-03 17:33:21 wondering why stocks haven’t moved or can’t get past resistance... had to look at monthly’s and see them big red reversal candles  me in tha face... so many bearish covering candles on so many charts... I have to remind myself to stay sharp n focused when playing this game

3169 2018-08-03 17:30:56 ....But didn’t you (@marketwizard87 ) ware referring it in a positive way - few days ago, when earnings were expected and you were holding it at that time ....

I could be totally wrong (if I am I apologize) as there are so many MJ stocks that I have been discussing these days.
3170 2018-08-03 17:30:19 Casino stocks are selling off sharply (MGM Resorts Intl./Caesars Entertainment Corp/Wynn Resorts/Las Vegas Sands) as Q3 L V convention/events business is weaker than expected. It's time to get new Dist 1 Congresista so Dina Titus can go to work full time at Salvadorian Consulate.
3171 2018-08-03 17:30:11 Just two of my favorite stocks to trade and companies to invest for long term.
3172 2018-08-03 17:29:33 I've seen a few people point out that it would be a good donation/membership-raising tactic.

Much like how the National Blood Service will always say they're desperate for more donors. It's not that stocks are low, just that plasma doesn't keep very long.

3182 2018-08-03 17:25:52 Traders Mentality

Bulls have more followers irrespective of their stocks not performing as per markets (Last rally is the perfect example when midcaps butchered and large caps took the mkts higher)

Bears have more critics, even if it goes 1 day against you
3183 2018-08-03 17:25:45 I’m at work and I’m hosting an event that is involving marketing, stocks, &forex& they are bashing on people in their 20s *everyones well over 40 here* & the dude goes “people in their 20s wont take it serious” & every one looks back at me
3184 2018-08-03 17:25:34 Today, 80% VBP trading above R1 of 6.93$ in $IAN - should bode well to break R2 at 7.10$ ....well, as with small ticket stocks a lot of grinding and churning at even number too 7.00$ - need better volume push - in the right direction though.

3232 2018-08-03 17:01:53 Kung mapera lang ako bibili ako ng stocks sa cube. Kasi, why not? Cube artists are talented. who cares if they're on fire and dating? They're humans and they deserve to be happy. They are just humans yet they create such quality piecessss 
3233 2018-08-03 17:01:10 In other news, my local Spar now stocks Cerevita. It’s more expensive than woolies though, so #andizi Spar. Probably first time I see something cheaper at woolies.
3234 2018-08-03 17:00:26 i did stocks on Holy Water to rinse my eyes... i was waiting for this!!!
3235 2018-08-03 17:00:13 Made it out in losers, only dropped a couple stocks
3236 2018-08-03 17:00:08 Stock drop: $ABUS and 17 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #ABUS
3237 2018-08-03 16:59:45 If you're interested yeah, I don't think they take the piss with emails (I can't remember getting any) and its a good service. It's essentially @RobinhoodApp but for the UK. Can buy and sell stocks without paying anything per trade so its possible to invest with small sums
3238 2018-08-03 16:59:37 Makes sense. Note that Trump has largely left Japan out of his trade enemies list. They've probably cut some deal. By look of it, one part was BoJ pumping US stocks whenever the latter got in trouble in exchange for Trump not including Japan in currency manipulators list.
3239 2018-08-03 16:59:17 TZ is TradeZero. Very good for shorting stocks, always have borrows. But are only open for Internationals
3240 2018-08-03 16:58:57 @LRubinson I woukd advise short term getting out of IQ but hold on to SHOP. SHOP is showing a familiar patrern and can hit $190 a share in 5 to 6 weeks. IQ however seems to want to gap down to $25 a share and Chinese stocks move very erratcially
3241 2018-08-03 16:58:51 Top Stocks Mai hai... Apna investment kamaal karega ... Invest and forget... For next 10yrs... Fir dekhna

3242 2018-08-03 16:58:49 Does anyone know if there's a website or tool that allows for sorting of stocks by % from all-time high?
3243 2018-08-03 16:57:49 P/E (price/earnings) ratio for U.S. stocks 15-17 for a historical avg. Now its around 24, which isn't crazy, but a little high.  Apple, your new trillion-dollar stock, has a P/E of 18. even tho it is crazy successful, market never gets impressed with Apple. It just grinds higher.
3244 2018-08-03 16:57:15 YESSS BOII! Please record matches? Also does setups have 3 stocks/no items/GC controllers? (Prob not...)
3245 2018-08-03 16:55:39 C’est ça  c’est pour ça d’un côté pour certains produits c’est sympa les précommandes ! Au moins tu es sûre d’avoir le tiens ! Puis avec le décalage horaire au Japon, pendant que toi tu bosses ou que tu n’est pas encore réveillé, les japonais on le temps de vider les stocks x)
3246 2018-08-03 16:55:37 Here is a big clue that u have hit rock bottom in ur #trading career.. (I know from losing $1M... twice).. U think that u can become a millionaire trading #stocks by doing the exact opposite of the trade u wanted to put on... U legitimately believe it too.

3248 2018-08-03 16:55:18 Stock markets are not economies, but they are of interest.

Japan now claims the second-biggest stock market after Chinese stocks lost $2.3 trillion since January. Japanese equities are now $6.2 trillion, Chinese equities $6.09 trillion, U.S. $31 trillion.
3249 2018-08-03 16:55:00 Enbridge Income Fund $ENF : is will now effectively be Enbridge shares.  Reported strong earnings.  Great for an income investor.  A tax free rollover. A nice dividend and dividend growth. Hold and tender to the offer.  #stocks @BNNBloomberg #smallandmidcapstocks #stockmarkets

3254 2018-08-03 16:51:24 Yes, except nobody in the history of the world stocks up on street cart sandwiches for lunch at 530 in the morning. Not when you live in a city where the world is your oyster at lunch and there are even some Michelin starred places that deliver...

3256 2018-08-03 16:50:54 The only thing left is to try shooting their way out of this with help from Russian FSB intelligence. They arm all their accountants and attorneys with Russian made AK47's and bump stocks and prepare for an ATF siege of their headquarters in Fairfax. Please show on Pay-Per-View!

3263 2018-08-03 16:46:48 I stopped using a stock broker back in the 70s when it occurred to me that if he really knew which stocks were going up, he wouldn't be sitting in a cubicle at Merrill Lynch.
3264 2018-08-03 16:46:48 Looks like it is "flowing" into the bond market to me. Stocks overall are not doing anything today.
3265 2018-08-03 16:46:43 Quite a feat achieved but when considering tech corps like Sony, HTC, Nokia etc, makes one wanna cross fingers and wait

It certainly would be an interesting time indeed for you as an investor to be holding a choice number of their old stocks right now

3271 2018-08-03 16:43:28 West Fraser Timber $WFT  It's a cyclical company, it's a strong company and that's why it's priced attractively.  Not too worried about it rolling over.  Think it's one of the best in the sector. Worth holding for at least a year. #investing $stocks @BNNBloomberg
3272 2018-08-03 16:43:06 Hey! Anyone care to speculate as to why small cap stocks are falling today? Didn't the small cap companies get the memo that our economy is as good as it gets? (B@@Ming).
3273 2018-08-03 16:42:58 Sensex is driven by few stocks...not all 30 of its components ...SIPs are more broad based....even a good stock like LnT is 10% below its life time high despite sensex flying
3274 2018-08-03 16:42:46 My green stocks updated:  GATA .091 +13.7% (w/.14 earnings per share)....UHLN .001 +10%....ANDI .003 +7%....SWRN .024 +4%....AMFE .096 +2%

3277 2018-08-03 16:40:34 This is a false premise, trickle down economics does NOT help the middle class. At least not in this unfettered capitalism society we live in now...some workers got [one time] bonuses, sure, but a majority of corps just put the extra income back into stocks.

3281 2018-08-03 16:37:09 pay attention to the market - pending home sales are off and mortgage applications are down - trust your instinct - homes are not "investments" like stocks - we saw that in 2008 - if you are buying for long term - 15+ you may be ok - be very very conservative
3282 2018-08-03 16:36:58 Quakes, Love it.  I will will track for another week to see what happens.  It still seems like many stocks are far from targets no matter who's numbers we use.  For example 11+ mil shares of Lamaride.  But this would be just another in a long list of positives!
3283 2018-08-03 16:35:46 Well at least their stocks have gone up since yesterday, hopefully knetz don’t turn this into a Sungmin situation. Then again that was with a whole wedding and not just dating.

And what is a TZ account?  I use TD Ameritrade, but SS is a problem.

3292 2018-08-03 16:32:42 Stocks around the world edged higher on Friday on robust earnings,  with consumer staples results boosting Wall Street, though a trade spat  between the U.S. and China and tepid U.S. jobs numbers capped gains and  weighed down the dollar.

3370 2018-08-03 16:01:50 It's also about the Capital Markets. Investors like risk as long as it is managed. Lots of money chasing the "next big thing". These companies are high risk/high reward growth stocks.

3423 2018-08-03 15:38:09 it's about sales engineering, not about the material used in production. you have 1000 pairs, 100 each of 10 sizes. you sell too fast the mid-sizes. then you do this, rise the price on mid-sizes and lower it on the ends, to keep the stocks up until the next order or collection.
3424 2018-08-03 15:37:41 Yeah, but Bush gave his friends a tax cut too. On borrowed money. We probably are still paying for it. You keep ignoring the obvious.

3500 2018-08-03 15:03:49 That’s true and stating that buy backs had anything to do with Apple price rising is plain absurd.
However is not totally accurate that having cash is exactly the same as buying back stocks. Buy backs is a type of dividend to shareholders while cash could be used for investments

3543 2018-08-03 14:49:08 Put another way, the role of housing is to democratize access to leverage. When leverage is only available to rich people, society stagnates. Ordinary people should *not* borrow money to buy stocks; but they can borrow money for a house a bit more responsibly.

3566 2018-08-03 14:39:24 I’ve automated IRA contributions for a while, additionally setting my dividend stocks to reinvest into themselves. So even if AAPL tanks by 30%, then I just get that much more so in dividend reinvestment.  I hope to  continue to be lazy and contribute even during corrections
3567 2018-08-03 14:39:19 I agree with that method. 1 or at least a small list of stocks. EOD, the ticker itself doesn't matter as much as our entry and exits. I keep $MU and $TWTR on watch just because of how they trade within the first 30 mins.

3613 2018-08-03 14:22:07 To be fair, it should probably be evaluated in terms of the impact of expanding the universe from two (stocks + Treasuries) to three (stocks + Treasuries + high yield).  Unsurprising you'd see little benefit when adding to stocks given credit/stock correlations.

3618 2018-08-03 14:20:03 I’ve been on here for 3 years and have had some sage guidance from a few good eggs on here. Fact is, my trading has taken a positive turn - away from AIM. I’m making more money based on TA trades with FTSE stocks. I’m climing out the AIM cesspit for good. 

S’long, and good luck!
3619 2018-08-03 14:19:40 Well Robert in my opinion every investor needs gold in his portfolio..It is a safety net in a very volatile world... Stocks and currencies can be wiped out in hours..like Steinhof...Russia..China are not buying Apple they are buying Gold..For a reason..
3620 2018-08-03 14:19:21 Right? My Facebook stocks are rebounding slowly, but surely.
3621 2018-08-03 14:19:01 I wasnt a fan then but was it THIS bad when baekhyun/taeyon and kai/krystal were revealed as couples?? like I know there was so much hate but did SM lose stocks and shit???
3622 2018-08-03 14:18:56 I'm also done but all I want to emphasize is that stocks are predictions about the future and you're suggesting changing by law what that future can be.

3626 2018-08-03 14:16:54 Good point. What is commercially available also reduced by Compulsory stockholding obligations. In Europe, directive mandates that member states hold oil and refined product stocks at the higher of 90 days of average net daily imports or 61 days of average inland consumption.
3627 2018-08-03 14:16:39 Stocks start Friday mixed. Employment report not so great. But that’s good too. We don’t need things getting out of hand. Keeps yields from going too high.

3634 2018-08-03 14:14:13 I didn't say the price was not going up. That's the definition of a bubble: it's an excellent investment while it's going up. It's when the illusion breaks, and people realise that they bought air and artificially priced stocks through buybacks and hype that things get dirty.
3635 2018-08-03 14:13:59 those stocks need to get laid too
3636 2018-08-03 14:13:08 No matter what he says it's extremely apparent to anyone that watches CLOSELY that he talks up or down depending on position, the stocks he trades. Can't help but wonder if he shorted after he made his infamous "joke" that he was actually buying. That seems VERY WRONG. $ARWR
3637 2018-08-03 14:13:07 $drus 1st rule of trading OTC stocks. Know who the usual pumpers are on twitter.
3638 2018-08-03 14:13:01 This typically happens near the end of major bull markets. The number of stocks driving the rally shrinks, as money supply growth is no longer sufficient to inflate prices across the board. This is inter alia reflected in the statistic you cite.
3639 2018-08-03 14:12:49 The amount of sources it’s on is remarkable. If it is fake. Man. That’s impressive. Lol. But if it’s not.

3649 2018-08-03 14:09:08 @CNBC @Rick_Santelli Why do you keep rooting for a breakout in the Dollar Index? Bad for stocks.
3650 2018-08-03 14:08:01 How can you say that?  It seems every dip is being bought no matter what and the demand for stocks is exceeding the supply.  So to me that suggests the majority are bullish.
3651 2018-08-03 14:08:00 Market and stocks rise lately whenever the latest tariff talks hit the news. This market strength in the face of 'bad' news is constructive and bullish.

3837 2018-08-03 12:49:29 True, but the next wave of investors will be looking for penny stocks just like in the past, and with a good entry, the ability to make money off of them will still arise. That's if new investors show up.....

3877 2018-08-03 12:29:37 I wanna know who Apple designed the Stocks app for. I think it was designed for people who don’t invest:

- can’t enter your personal holdings/portfolio, so it’s not very useful for casual investors

- no after hours support

- chart is a fixed window in time, can’t be scrolled
3878 2018-08-03 12:28:55 Booms and busts are manifestations of greed and fear - so will perforce be a part of every asset pricing. These carnal emotions tend to amplify with price movements, on both sides. As stock prices rise, demand goes up; as prices tank, supply side of stocks rise-contrary to logic

3880 2018-08-03 12:27:55 This is a rabbit hole many go down to once faced with (i) the fact QE ended 4 1/2 years ago and (ii) the low time correlation between QE programs and rise in asset prices

If, say, the ECB QE had a meaningful impact, how come European stocks have been such dogs over recent years?
3881 2018-08-03 12:27:51 Even his taxes wouldn't show his "net worth".
For example, I could have won $100 million in a lottery 5 years ago, and put $100k in a checking acct and the $99 million+ in stocks and let it sit.
I might not even make enough interest in the checking acct to require filing taxes!

3965 2018-08-03 11:34:16 It's a procedure that adjusts the capital gains amount for inflation. The inflationary effect isn't truly a capital gain so the adjustment makes good sense and makes the tax more fair. It's not just for the wealthy but instead helps anyone with a 401(k) or investments in stocks.

3985 2018-08-03 11:15:12 US is spending $45 billion on aid/military operations in Afghanistan, every year. Last decade, they were spending $100 billion per year.

Who, and what stocks benefit from this? What happens when the Afghan gravy train ends?

I understand why many are pushing for war with Iran.
3986 2018-08-03 11:14:52 Do you invest in any other products aside from cryptocurrency and state pensions / 401k type products.

3990 2018-08-03 11:13:53 Totally agree. China cannot dump all trsys.. perhaps they can stop buying but then what to do with the cash generated form defending the peg? Abandon the peg perhaps an option, but would result in market turmoil. Seems they don't want stocks to fall so that doesn't seem likely.

3993 2018-08-03 11:13:12 Comparing current Nifty P/E with that of older years and similarly P/B is not correct. For change in P/E and P/B over years, constant change in the composition of Nifty stocks is the culprit. P/G, instead, would give a fair idea on valuations.

4015 2018-08-03 10:56:14 i recall there was a tax advantage to front loading those long end purchases...but that doesn't imply selling...just a slower absorption back to previous levels from years past.

If you believe there will be a recession in the future, you would reallocate from stocks to bonds.

4022 2018-08-03 10:50:23 Because if there is no, or not much, multiple compression, the growth is approximately your total return (plus the cash generation). The danger with high growth stocks is the multiple compression that occurs as the growth falls.

4105 2018-08-03 09:49:57 Now that Small and MidCap stocks have started recovering, I have started observing that Whatsapp stock groups are back in action with their 'Target Achieved', 'Bulls Eye' messages and '' smileys.
4106 2018-08-03 09:48:55 I'm sure a lot of the falls we have been seeing particularly in UK small and less liquid stocks are due to SB/CFD retail customers selling due to forced de-leveraging due to ESMA.

Or the analysts knows the end is near and don’t want to stomp on Elon.

4116 2018-08-03 09:42:18 In the Philippines, on days or in areas where the grocery stores don't give plastic bags, they tend to just pack your groceries in the cardboard boxes for the stocks. Cardboard is biodegradable and hey, free box. So, yeah, surprised the developed countries didn't think of that.

4131 2018-08-03 09:28:59 Guys bili tayo stocks ng cube lol
4132 2018-08-03 09:27:57 Anleger my guess it’s Elon himself or the big stockholders the Funds that are protecting the stockprice from falling in the pre and aftermarket.
My guess is that a lot of stocks changed hands yesterday from smart to dumb money (they got out)
4133 2018-08-03 09:27:57 Should of had him arrested and locked up into stocks on Trafalgar Square to throw rotten veg and fruit
4134 2018-08-03 09:27:51 Currently a lot of markets are looking primed for a decline. Bund futures, tech stocks, commodities and cryptos. Risk seems very high in any markets at the moment.

4142 2018-08-03 09:21:49 Fair points. Obviously sovereign risk and a discount needs to be applied but the other DRC stocks I assume you are referring to either don’t have a defined resource with feasibility studies or are in the middle of nowhere with zero available infrastructure. We will see!

4157 2018-08-03 09:06:48 ...press irregardless if it’s good/bad publicity. Because their store is the cheapest and stocks almost anything you want, any kind of brand awareness for him works - and saves him potentially millions in advertising.

4160 2018-08-03 09:05:08 Historically, equipment/consumer finance stocks trade at 15x forward earnings at their growth years. Assuming they do close to 20c EPS FY19 then it should be at $3. To me it seems it’s heading there next couple of months...... serious buying going on!!

4163 2018-08-03 09:01:38 Dividends declared from profits by selling stocks. Stock goes up by 10% after selling resulting in uptick on less number of qty now even for growth option. While investor opted for growth for long term value creation with no intention of forced selling because div is to be paid.
4164 2018-08-03 09:01:06 So you want to censor and only allow the content YOU deem acceptable! Slippery slope! You know it too that’s why your doing it! When your stocks fall maybe you will reconsider people want to choose what they listen to not be told!
4165 2018-08-03 09:00:55 Don't use Amazon and would never buy from Apple. We don't even have a bookshop in our town (Barnsley) and there is nowhere that stocks a good selection of magazines.

4168 2018-08-03 09:00:25 Placed more emphasis on intraday trading and locking down profits this week, worked a charm! Purely focused on stocks with catalysts and limited the swing setups.

4207 2018-08-03 08:32:38 Well, this fucking sucks to hear. Earlier this year, I was all '2018 is Cube's year' bcuz of how their artists' comebacks + (G)I-DLE's hot debut were so well-received, and now learning how their stocks dropped bcuz of all the dating scandals and rumors that were dropped today...
4208 2018-08-03 08:32:35 But they don't buy while falling. May be MFs bought earlier to fall. Typically, retail will buy into the stock after fall and stocks fall further. Recency bias :(

4233 2018-08-03 08:06:25 Russia  Ag Ministry Says “No Plans to Limit Wheat Exports”
By Elena Mazneva
(Bloomberg) Russia’s total grain harvest is expected to be at least 100m tons & given available stocks grain exports this year are seen at the last year’s level of up to 44m tons, the AgMinistry said.

4237 2018-08-03 08:03:36 "The biggest risk is not being fully invested in stocks" -- sales line invented by stock brokers (and endlessly repeated by clueless stock market tourists), NOT by a thoughtful investor.

"The most important thing is always being 100% long stocks" -- said Howard Marks never.
4238 2018-08-03 08:02:42 never seen the market  or individual stocks go up in a straight line. If the reasons why  you bought a share still stands then hold on.

4243 2018-08-03 07:56:53 Hi Sarah one thing that needs considering QUICKLY is all the SMEs involved in UK healthcare. For us to increase stocks to the required ! holding will kill our cash flow. How do we deal with that scenario?! Help is needed.
4244 2018-08-03 07:56:44 #Turkey monthly inflation surprisingly eases to 0.55% in July, down from 2.61% in June, helping avoid another disaster for lira and stocks at early trade. #usdtry, though, still near record-high 5.1 levels on political pressure from US with Pompeo-Cavusoglu meeting inconclusive.

4369 2018-08-03 06:19:15 Let's just not talk about the stocks or something along that subject. The thing is, at leats my brothers are trying to be happy. They won't do what they do without knowing the consequences. I trust them, and I know they're mature enough to choose their own way.

4474 2018-08-03 05:06:39 S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as Apple hits $1 trillion mark: Technology stocks pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher on Thursday, driven by Apple shares as the iPhone maker became the first publicly traded U.S. company worth a trillion dollars.

4482 2018-08-03 05:03:47 The reason many don’t get rich because they want to get rich fast. The reason many don’t do well in stocks because of they obsessively chase multi-baggers.
4483 2018-08-03 05:03:41 so cubes stocks went down who’s willing to donate me 2.28$ usd to buy a stock 
4484 2018-08-03 05:03:27 The way Cube Entertainment’s stocks are plummeting like this
4485 2018-08-03 05:02:06 namjoon the world of kpop is a mess without you. look what you’ve done. you left us. stocks are burning, people are fucking, there’s something going on with debts, everything is on fire, we arent able to manage on our own. we need you. it’s been 6 days, this is a cry for help.
4486 2018-08-03 05:01:14 @XiaomiIndia following OnePlus footprint. Focusing on Mi A2 camera samples from celebrities on Instagram, Facebook & Twitter ahead of it's launch. Hope they ditch flash sale like OnePlus, arrange better stocks and go for an open sale. Xiaomi is not small company once they were.

4491 2018-08-03 04:58:56 cube's plummeting stocks rip
4492 2018-08-03 04:58:19 Wow I really hope Bighits stocks never drop like Cubes is right now after the dating news..if our boys ever reveal they are dating I hope we all hype them and go buy even more albums and have a streaming party to celebrate them. Seeing Cubes stocks plummet so hard is crazy.
4493 2018-08-03 04:57:52 Algunos fansites de Pentagon han cerrado, los stocks de Cube aparentemente han bajado no estoy segura de eso. Usar a alguien del Big3 sería muy sucio, a menos que sea algo como lo de la esposa de JYP y ese culto extraño

Chinese stocks worth $6.09 trillion compared with $6.17 trillion in Japan.

U.S. maintains the leader board with just over $31 trillion.
4495 2018-08-03 04:56:36 QND WHAT ARE STOCKS IM SO UNEDUCATED
4496 2018-08-03 04:55:26 Sorry, when I said 90%+ long I meant the opposite of shorting. I do hold stocks for days/ weeks and trade around these positions longer than suggested in the article though there was a period I was opening and closing almost everything within the day.
4497 2018-08-03 04:55:04 With the recovery in the market, the stocks which gave nightmares to a lot of investors in the beginning of 2018, are turning out to be the darlings of their eyes.

Same Stock. Two Different Situations. Two Different Behaviours. Market is not at fault. But we really are.

get the delusional mentality of you being able to date your favourite idol out of your goddamned mind and discrediting talent and hardwork.

4511 2018-08-03 04:47:45 Cube’s stocks going down reminds me of the time jyp’s stocks went down bc of the cult rumor hhh
4512 2018-08-03 04:47:31 Are cube’s stocks really going down because of this?
4513 2018-08-03 04:46:47 n e ways its nearly 6am so we goin  nap prob be back in like an hour (?) gn to triple h and cubes stocks only xoxo
4514 2018-08-03 04:46:44 i feel so off because the fact that cube’s stocks are plummeting and fansites are quitting just because hyuna and hyojong admitted they’re dating is just so sad like why can’t y’all just be happy, if you’re truly fans :(
4515 2018-08-03 04:46:04 *stocks
4516 2018-08-03 04:45:55 ohmygod cube stocks are falling.....
4517 2018-08-03 04:44:59 their stocks are falling D:
4518 2018-08-03 04:44:22 My fave part abt kpop dating is the fact that everyone calls it a ~scandal~ and then the company’s stocks drop like LMAO
4519 2018-08-03 04:44:08 cube ent stocks keep going down 
4520 2018-08-03 04:44:03 tragic maybe if cube stanned loona their stocks wouldn’t have dropped and hyuna And edawn wouldn’t have to sleep on the mouse infected floors 
4521 2018-08-03 04:43:54 cubes stocks going down fjfjfkfmfmfjfkkfjf
4522 2018-08-03 04:43:42 The boycott thing. Pissed fans wont buy the goods of dating idols. Investors know this. So they expect that they wont get as good of a ROI on their stocks bc the company won't make as much money, so they sell off in the hopes to avoid losing money.
4523 2018-08-03 04:43:26 So you’re saying you have 50-100 open positions? How can you even keep track of that many? With 100 stocks, you pretty much are the market, why not just buy an aggressive ETF?
4524 2018-08-03 04:43:03 Hopefully their stocks even out by the end of the week
4525 2018-08-03 04:42:21 Ummm... the new stocks app in iOS 12?
4526 2018-08-03 04:41:55 Yeah it was actually big news here in town today about mgm stocks. I don’t keep up with stocks much either - but with casinos being a big lifeblood of our economy, we get regular updates.
4527 2018-08-03 04:41:52 are cube stocks really going down cuz of this...why....
4528 2018-08-03 04:41:51 kaloka ung stocks ng cube susko

4530 2018-08-03 04:41:32 i hope y'all out there being happy and congratulating e'dawn and hyuna on their relationship be lining up to buy some stocks. we going downhill fast.
4531 2018-08-03 04:41:25 sm bouta do some shit to steal those stocks
4532 2018-08-03 04:41:20 I hate that idols feel like they have to apologize for dating. Or that a companies stocks will fall that hard cause of dating “scandals”
4533 2018-08-03 04:40:57 Why does a company’s stocks drop if there is news about artists dating... I am confused..
4534 2018-08-03 04:40:13 Blame it on the listing gains phenomenon during the 00s. Stocks like Indiabulls, HDIL, DLF gave high percentage returns on listing day itself, and Indiabulls became a multibagger. So people look at IPOs as a surefire "ground floor" entry.
4535 2018-08-03 04:40:12 All these ENT companies probably showing their artists Cube stocks dropping, letting these niggas know if they ever mention they are dating this could happen..

4539 2018-08-03 04:38:57 cube dating scandals could NEVER do what jypcult did... we had jyp’s stocks dropping by 15% and possible court cases some boring hetero drama can’t compare
4540 2018-08-03 04:38:14 i don't keep up with stocks didn't know that.. but yes.. something could have been done... this doesn't happen in any other pro league...
4541 2018-08-03 04:37:49 Hot comb stocks are wayyy up..
4542 2018-08-03 04:37:35 Hi Satish, nope - the stocks are delivered to the demat linked to the trading account the orders are placed from

4559 2018-08-03 04:31:39 Joy of adding stocks: Start with 2% allocation and then keep adding 1% slowly with price correction or time correction. some occasionally bounce quickly but most don’t, giving us enough opportunities to add.

4565 2018-08-03 04:30:26 either some industry ppl really have it out for Cube staff/stocks as a whole or the call is coming from inside the house

4588 2018-08-03 04:24:27 it's the numerous dating rumors for sure, stockholders are assuming people are gonna react negatively to the news, so they're probably dropping cube stocks
4589 2018-08-03 04:22:26 It only hurts you because you’re a flop, like cube’s stocks rn
4590 2018-08-03 04:21:59 if u think stocks are run by stans.... stay in school kids

4592 2018-08-03 04:21:23 #Venky's on fire from yesterday. 35% up.
Investor psychology- they hammer the stocks when added to ASM and fire it when out.  It has nothing much to alter business model or financials.

4796 2018-08-03 03:41:35 You're a joke Phil. Move your dictatorship somewhere else, please. When someone that disagrees with your views come here, you pull out all the stocks to make sure they can't be seen by the public. You love diversity - just not diversity of opinion. Glad I don't live in Auckland.
4797 2018-08-03 03:41:34 Still early days, but, can you argue against higher wages, lower unemployment, lower tax rates, across the board? Stock market up 30%? 2+M less on food stamps? Stocks valuation up 1T?

What would you change?
4798 2018-08-03 03:41:19 Not true. There was a Chinese oil company that beat Apple to the punch. They have since dropped in stocks but they aren’t the first.
4799 2018-08-03 03:41:15 My stocks shot up! Jobs for women and blacks are great! Jobs are coming back & more $ in my paycheck. That’s just a few.

4828 2018-08-03 03:22:43 Stocks don't have expense, Mutual funds have. Why does futures trade expensive than stock - cost of carry. Low NAV mean expensive for the buyers.

4838 2018-08-03 03:12:24 i wouldn't worry. FB stocks are still plummeting, no?
4839 2018-08-03 03:10:25 Stocks also have uncertain returns but people often pay premiums for them instead of discounts. Otherwise all stocks would trade below book value. NAV is more accurate than book value because it is market linked and updated daily. So I’m not sure that discount argument holds
4840 2018-08-03 03:10:03 Oh trust me, that mother of mine stocks up on so much stuff and never uses it. She once had a box of Rice Krispies that had past date by 4 years before my sister and I told her to toss it lol.

4853 2018-08-03 02:57:38 I suspect they will be phased out after the current 4-year consultation period is complete. That phase-out will likely span more than a decade after that. In the mean time, the wild stocks have already collapsed.
4854 2018-08-03 02:57:02 But only five stocks are responsible for how much of the rise?

4857 2018-08-03 02:56:30 1/2 No, these are the lowest rates you'll see for a very long time as inflation is coming back.

High rates drive down asset values, i.e. stocks and especially bonds. But inflation drives people to inflation hedges and that drives real estate through the roof despite high rates.

4919 2018-08-03 02:16:34 I wonder why.I can name a few people that are the root cause.Maybe if the Sec actually did something about it and prosecuted the people that are naked shorting these stocks to death.Firms like Meryl Lynch wouldn’t have to resort to this.

4921 2018-08-03 02:14:42 I just now put it together. You trade stocks, which is highly competitive, and you play like a wizard queen in games that require fierceness. Competition drives you. Is that a fair parallel?

Only need an extra 10-25C as I've seen stocks rip whole dollars after selling...

Dec 12, 1980               :  $1.2 billion

Stock return since IPO: 50,000%

If I would've invested $1000 in 1980 for Apple I would now own $500,000 in Apple stocks. What has my life come to?

5024 2018-08-03 00:49:15 Clarification — for bullish, we want to see a $NYMO higher low as a positive divergence with a stocks lower low. That’s a type of positive divergence that’s led to many solid rallies.
5025 2018-08-03 00:48:53 European stocks fell on Thursday as a cocktail of trade tensions and disappointing results dented market sentiment. Siemens sank 4.4% as its revenue fell short of forecasts, while Hugo Boss plummeted 7.5% as its earnings missed estimates.

5027 2018-08-03 00:48:15 US stocks mostly rose on Thursday, spurred higher by Apple as continuing post-result applause from investors pushed the tech giant's market capitalisation beyond US$1 trillion.

5030 2018-08-03 00:47:02 I might start dabbling in futures & forex markets next for the experience, so I can have access to even more opportunities around the clock, instead of just stocks, options & cryptos
5031 2018-08-03 00:46:35 I don’t tweet about stocks on the move until I’m already in them (locked and loaded); everyone else does too. Dont chase, don’t buy my shares, don’t follow alerts. $DRUS $ANDI $LIBE $AVOI $CELZ $HEME $RBIZ
5032 2018-08-03 00:45:53 Cash is not a bad option. Given that retail would anyway not be in value stocks but momentum which even after the correction may still be quite expensive.
5033 2018-08-03 00:42:22 Apple latest big money tax breaks bought back their stocks raised their stock prices, now selling it like business is booming. Funny before this they were doing well without any real new products. Wonder how that happened?

5037 2018-08-03 00:38:38 Plz don't invest money in this bro
5038 2018-08-03 00:37:10 The stock market doesn't go up if people dont have money to spend. People have money to spend now, unlike the Obama years, therefore stocks rise. Do the rich get richer? Sure. Do I have more? Yes. Do most average Americans have more? Yes. Hence the stock market rise.
5039 2018-08-03 00:36:04 Aussie market is recovering from recent losses. #ASX 200 +14pts or 0.25% to 6255 in early trade despite losses for larger mining & bank stocks. Consumer, energy & healthcare stocks lifting #ausbiz
5040 2018-08-03 00:36:03 The Bears can’t fathom the truth or reality that $HMNY & #MoviePass could become profitable and announce details that prove it. 

Most New companies go through “growing pains,” but the Bears want to exaggerate anything potentially negative for their own financial benefit.
5041 2018-08-03 00:35:04 It does not - but these days stocks that are going up are the ones which have the highest NPAs because the logic is that "worst is over and it will become better". Same as 2002 when I wrote this satire
5042 2018-08-03 00:31:43 Let’s index their salaries to the national average, make it illegal for them and staff to trade stocks on information they obtain in office, and convert their pension plan to social security, that would have the same result.

5046 2018-08-03 00:29:47 Haha. I think we will have to wait for a sector wide sentiment shift for any lithium stocks to rally at this point.

5057 2018-08-03 00:19:36 أمريكا أصبحت قطب أوحد منذ سنوات
وهي اليوم تناطح قارات بعد أن كانت تناطح دول
5058 2018-08-03 00:19:11 I also feel some of the best trading processes can be hard to scale down to a PDT new trader. I know starting small and adding in some good systems keeps you confident and safe but isn’t doable for small accounts. Also only certain priced stocks on small acc
5059 2018-08-03 00:18:57 That was before the refurbs on the '73 and '73 stocks and also before the Northern line started using the 1995 stock. Its amazing how different it looked back then.
5060 2018-08-03 00:18:39 I need stocks 
5061 2018-08-03 00:18:12 يبدو لك هذا
الصين مجرد ناسخ وليس صاحب فكر وابتكار
الإتحاد السوفيتي ناطح الأمريكان وأنتهى بإنهياره وتقسيمه
الصين ضحية أمريكية قادمة
بالمناسبة
حرب أمريكا التجارية بدأت بسبب تلاعب الصين تحديداً بعملتها لإبقاءها منخفضة القيمة من أجل الصادرات
ولم تستمع للتحذيرات الأمريكية
5062 2018-08-03 00:17:29 *on stocks I mean
5063 2018-08-03 00:17:25 Weird, I've had a $11 raise over the last 5 years and know multiple people that got a raise after Trump's tax cuts. And yeah, stocks are a reflection in part on the economy. When people make more, they invest more. Why do you think it's at 25k right now??
5064 2018-08-03 00:16:15 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your chronic fatigue
5065 2018-08-03 00:15:09 @Stocktwits no surprise, the number 1 room waiting list is Daytrading Penny Stocks.  #Rooms

اكسور التي تمتلك اليوفي هي ثالث اغلى شركة خاصة في العالم
وذات مرة وفي محضر رد اليوفي على تعليق مسؤل في مانشستر على صفقة بيع بوغبا حين قال "اليوفي لا يمكنه رفض 100 مليون يورو"
فرد عليه ألكان "اليوفي يستطيع شراء مانشستر بكبره وطردك منه خلال 24 ساعة فقط"
5067 2018-08-03 00:13:21 “IM CHECKING STOCKS DUDE” @steveamente
5068 2018-08-03 00:12:41 النادي بمفرده هو الأغلى صحيح
ولكن كشركات أم مالكة فاليوفي ملك لشركة اكسور التي بامكانها شراء مانشستر بأرباح شهر فقط
أما مسألة فضيحة الكالتشيو فقد تمت تبرأة النادي وفوق هذا اليوفي يطالب الإتحاد الإيطالي ب 420 مليون يورو كتعويضات ورفض عرض الإتحاد بإعادة لقبي الدوري له كتعويض
5069 2018-08-03 00:12:04 Then if everyone stop buying the ones at the top, then the stocks below will go down. Don't you agree? Somebody has to buy them at the top for the stocks to trend upwards.
5070 2018-08-03 00:11:01 I’ve often suspected that at least some of the backwards-tested models leave out stocks that went to 0. Is this just paranoia? For instance the dartboard/monkeys approach that throws darts at today’s market and look backwards.
5071 2018-08-03 00:10:44 Also, and this seems to get consciously neglected, but the reason most confederate soldiers wouldn't've owned slave is the same reason most WWII conscripts wouldn't've owned stocks: they were valuable economic assets that a 20-year-old man in Lee's army wouldn't have owned.
5072 2018-08-03 00:10:25 Okay. You win. Sell your house, cash all your stocks. The economy sucks and is going to hell. Unfalsifiable my ....

5074 2018-08-03 00:09:56 Stocks do of course matter to a company whether or not they understand what they are investing in or not. Shareholders just expect returns on their money and if they don't see it coming they will freak out. Nintendo have a tonne of money and at this point in time no worries. xxx
5075 2018-08-03 00:09:40 It's because the greedy bastards are buying back stocks and paying CEO'S 
outrageous amounts of money.

5078 2018-08-03 00:05:19 Asia equity markets begin with a positive tone after a similar performance of stocks on Wall St where tech outperformed on Apple's USD 1tln historical feat; ASX 200 (+0.2%), Nikkei 225 (+0.3%); KOSPI (+0.2%)
5079 2018-08-03 00:04:58 All the Dow stocks would be nice too.
5080 2018-08-03 00:04:58 Anyone pick up some Facebook stocks since the drop? I think It’s a still a good long term investment.
5081 2018-08-03 00:02:24 Well, yeah. C’mon. Give me more credit than that. Lol. I just don’t know which company stocks to follow.
5082 2018-08-03 00:02:04 SA MGA GUSTO PONG BUMILI NG ULTRA PURE PLUS PURIFIER, PM LANG PO MARAMI  AKO STOCKS AND RESELLERS ARE WELCOME 
5083 2018-08-03 00:01:45 I think it depends on ur timeframe... If u trade Forex with a relatively small acct, u need the perfect entry or volatility can knock u out easily. With stocks and longer term trades, definitely better to wait for a clear turn
5084 2018-08-03 00:01:44 MBeth. My wife and I are retired. Our real estate values are going way up. Out retirement is sky rocketing.  Our stocks are going thru the roof.  We’re making a fortune.  Thanks to Trump.  A lot of our friends are in the same place. Aren’t you there also?
