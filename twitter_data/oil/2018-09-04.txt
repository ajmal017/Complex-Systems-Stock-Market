1 2018-09-04 23:59:41 we don't need additional oil drilling. our current production is meeting our needs. we cannot replace environmental disasters.
2 2018-09-04 23:59:35 A nice big false flag is probably in the works - some big outrage to push the U.S to fight 4 Israel and the Vatican's banks. Pipeline war and easily accessed oil are the focus of the wars right now. Natural gas soon will be king and U.S $ cartel wants to eat Russia's lunch.

4 2018-09-04 23:59:09 Man I had so much fun helping my dad at work and afterwards I helped my older brother fix his truck like add new lights and a put a new trunk lid on it and finnaly replace the oil in his truck. Seems I had a busy long day

6 2018-09-04 23:58:49 He paid off our over $30b debt without accumulating more. Even when oil sold less than $40 through their first term. 

Your mcm had been crying like babg that oil now selling at over $70 is too low. Thus had accumulated over N23t debt for even ur unborn generation

38 2018-09-04 23:55:51 This is catastrophically stupid. We don't need the oil for jobs. The pipeline only creates an estimated 90 permanent jobs, according to KM's application to the NEB. With an estimated total investment of over $13B that's a terrible ROI.

42 2018-09-04 23:55:15 Oil companies like BP knew about the effects of human industrial climate change and chose not only to hide it, but to fund lobbyists who argued it wasn’t real. It’s almost entirely on them. Well, and us for buying oil. And the US for gutting it’s lobbying laws.
43 2018-09-04 23:55:12 Morrison has a biased narrow view of the world. He's the epitome of a white 50's man. A snake oil salesman if ever there was one. He'll be promising to turn our lawns into paths of gold to win next election

52 2018-09-04 23:52:54 But we give away our oil to USA and foreign countries then consumers are gouged when importing the refined products back. Canada could have done both export and refining but previous governments sold us out!
53 2018-09-04 23:52:33 Totally left my mind to get an oil change this morning
54 2018-09-04 23:52:03 @ClayneCrawford I saw the lethal weapon season 3 trailer. Maaaaan what happended? You made that show for what it is. With all respect to Damien Waynes, Jordana Brewster and the rest of the cast. They are fantastic actors.  You're part and acting was the oil to the engine.

57 2018-09-04 23:51:24 Just like we can say don't vote for Morrison, he's controlled by Murdoch, Reinhart, every coal, gas and oil producer and every rich guy in Australia, and probably the Kochs in the US, too.
58 2018-09-04 23:51:13 The bicycle was sweet.. Everyone who thinks she needs a car.. Yep.. Give her another bill.. Insurance.. gas  maintenance.. Oil changes.. Car payments.. 
59 2018-09-04 23:51:10 The price of oil dropped by 2/3 during the 2008 recession, from 150 US/Barrel to 50. That crippled their economy. Venezuela is a failed petro-state because of both this and their subsequent inaction.

68 2018-09-04 23:50:11 Any of y'all use castor oil for y'all hair?
69 2018-09-04 23:49:58 Interesting that there's a call to emotion on a dankula thread. I think people are demonizing a 'big bad evil' and that's resulting in inaction and division. Because the big bad is so evil, you can't point out the fact that Venezuela's economy relied on oil for ~80% of it's GDP.
70 2018-09-04 23:49:57 i might try that!! my issue isn't with oil i just find that my foundation fades if i don't powder... i use a lot of powder, but i just buff it in i don't bake except for under my eyes
71 2018-09-04 23:49:45 Notice how they slipped in "port expansion"? Makes me wonder if this is the Liberal way of shutting down any other oil and gas export options that may arise (Churchill?)

80 2018-09-04 23:48:59 I think there is a misunderstanding around the @StandforAlaska campaign.  I see posts that say we don't need oil or mines (goofy statement in itself) but what about roads, bridges, alternative energy sites, & docks.  That is what this issue is about. We NEED those.  VOTE NO on 1.

89 2018-09-04 23:48:17 Direct injection and oil being dumped into the intake through the PCV. It's what killed my Silverado and the awful AFM motor.
90 2018-09-04 23:48:09 I believe the transition will be faster than most believe. Who will buy an ICE when a BEV is cheaper and charging+service is a fraction of an ICE? That'll be the reality in only a few years. Demand will force the oil loving brands to transition fast or die.
91 2018-09-04 23:48:06 No stream tonight. Pulling single parent duty while Melissa Clark burns the midnight oil.
92 2018-09-04 23:48:02 I never leave the oil game, but these losers could get jobs if they weren't such pieces of shit. For a while there were no jobs to be had so i would let it slide a bit.

141 2018-09-04 23:40:48 Any light-bodied oil, from 3-in-1 to camelia to jojoba.
142 2018-09-04 23:40:40 Not saying that it’s not profitable. Big difference though between profitable and paying off legislators. It’s why the Republican in TX went 100% renewable already. What you need to understand is how much oil and gas overcontrols. Even in renewables you can diversify the energy.
143 2018-09-04 23:40:38 It's all in the intention.  Do you intend to kill innocents by not selling oil or grain?
144 2018-09-04 23:40:35 The children i nanny have the wildest palates. Like for lunch the 7 year old asked me to make him black beans with olive oil, chopped tomato, and paprika. Like damn kid eat a pb&j.

149 2018-09-04 23:40:08 Val Verde: Magical Mysterious oil well on fire. Units are attempting to locate it.
150 2018-09-04 23:40:06 I don’t understand how mfers have free maintenance oil changes and still be thousands of miles overdue

153 2018-09-04 23:39:46 You’re embarrassing yourself @fred_guttenberg.
154 2018-09-04 23:39:46 No hate, just an intense disdain for snake oil salesman.
155 2018-09-04 23:39:43 Basically salad veggies that can survive without refrigerating. Onions, cucumbers, peppers, celery. Lots of oil and vinegar, salt and pepper.
156 2018-09-04 23:39:38 Nah. Give him the baby oil. Don't you remember the old slip n slides? Leprechaun edition.
157 2018-09-04 23:39:36 And what is our main export? Where is our largest economic growth. You are attacking what will be the last FF standing, and you aren't even attacking the worst sources of that FF. The world will use oil for a very long time and climate policy acknowledges this reality.
158 2018-09-04 23:39:29 Stopped by Twenty Mile Wines home of the Olive House and their new location is a huge hit! Make sure to stop in to try different flavors of wine & olive oil! What more can you ask for in one stop

160 2018-09-04 23:39:16 Harus pake cleansing oil? Kalo milk cleanser gimana? Trus itu kamu gosok2in pake cotton Bud nya sesudah pake cleansing oil kan?
161 2018-09-04 23:39:13 Bye, Felicia. 

Kavanaugh will be confirmed. You can thank Harry Reid for the dims not having any ability to stop it.

Trump will get to appoint at least two more SCOTUS justices and maybe four before he leaves office on January 20, 2025.

You lot lost, deal with it.

165 2018-09-04 23:38:54 New markets? How about our OWN market. Instead of trudging oil halfway across the world polluting the Oceans and giving billions to corrupt regimes and governments let's get become self sufficient like the U.S is doing

174 2018-09-04 23:37:35 Snake Oil Salesman Of the Year is a very prestigious award!
175 2018-09-04 23:37:16 Get it thru ur thick skulls, JC is a fictional character & the Bible is a book of historical.fables. Religion is the drug of choice for half witted idiots who are easily exploited by snake oil salesmen, charlatens, quacks & confidence tricksters. Power & control is its objective.
176 2018-09-04 23:37:09  It’s because it’s what the people want.  Many are divesting from fossil fuels and investing in renewables. Back when hemp was the first fuel it was because the oil and gas industry wanted to control. Vastly different. This is people demand & necessary for our planet.
177 2018-09-04 23:37:01 There is a company, Ladgroup ltd. In Ikenne, Ogun State. They process Shea to oil for export. They are looking to stock up soon. All the best.
178 2018-09-04 23:36:56 Luke, 1- what you have mentioned is the correct argument for an Asian marker, but not necessarily a yuan-denominated marker.  2- Who is going to trade the yuan-denominated oil contract, the Japanese or the Koreans? None! As @Big_Orrin mentioned, it is a local contract

185 2018-09-04 23:35:47 This is $ome BS that $tate of Ohio i$ doubling down on not even allowing us Ohioan$ to either by or sell CBD oil til they get their monopolized cartels running maybe in 2019 to force all 2 by only from them as of 9/8. How would this be legal in court to not be able to buy online?
186 2018-09-04 23:35:46 Frank. The guy was a snake oil salesman.Or perhaps focused on the razor blade model. He did it well. There's an opportunity there.

212 2018-09-04 23:31:35 That’s what the Lieberals wanted all along anyway. I think  Turdeau is getting a kickback from buying all of the Saudi oil.
213 2018-09-04 23:31:35 Scottish Power consumers have received notice of a 2.9% increase in price per unit from 1st October. They say due to "rise in wholesale enery prices", but in reality they are due to Brexit-related drop in the value of the pound relative to US dollar, used in all gas/oil markets
214 2018-09-04 23:31:33 Yes. Grate one zucchini, one small onion and as much garlic as you like. Sauté in olive oil over medium heat until golden. Add lots of black pepper. Add one large can crushed tomatoes, one small can tomato paste. Add one tablespoon salted butter. Salt to taste. Add oregano and
215 2018-09-04 23:31:27 Did you know Germany gets their oil from Russia?  This is a very bad thing, and Trump told Merkle he couldn't support Germany.  He also has Russia leveraged because of it.   There is more you don't know.  You have to work very hard to remain stupid.  Stop watching FAKE NEWS.

I bought a used vehicle a couple of weeks ago. As I do, I take it to the dealer of that make for an initial oil change and to get a running list of potential issues with it and I let them know that upfront.

222 2018-09-04 23:30:30 We aren't. Vegan means no animal products because animals are being tortured and abused in so many ways for those products. Some people are just eating plant based diets(and maybe calling themselves vegan) and avoid oil for some reason

242 2018-09-04 23:28:07 Well, I used soy wax and citronella essential oil. I get mine from YoungLiving, but you can use pretty much any essential oils company you want. I don't think the candle's going to be very pretty, but I heavily concentrated the oils to see if it'd help.
243 2018-09-04 23:28:03 So who can I pay/shmoke out to do my oil change 
244 2018-09-04 23:28:03 I feel like all I do is check the oil level in my jeep
245 2018-09-04 23:27:52 @RudeMechanic Hello. I’m reading your article ‘How to Saw’ in Popular Woodworking’s ‘Handsaw Basics’. You mention wiping your saws with an oily rag. 

I assume you don’t mean motor oil. What oil do you use?

One point to do with climate, the others not. His point to do with climate was wrong. There, refuted!

253 2018-09-04 23:27:09 California has already determined that it would not be wise to build desalination plants. Calif has known about falling water levels for over 100 years. Water wells emptied and land sinking as well as earthquakes due to drilling oil/water creating empty caverns. Ca. knows drought

261 2018-09-04 23:25:20  How come a prime minister of a country importing 90% of its oil “control” the price of something which is affected mostly by arab -west relations is so funny !
262 2018-09-04 23:25:08 Put some oil in your defuser and drink a glass of water. You may be busy ~but~ self care will ultimately help you handle life better

264 2018-09-04 23:24:55 Check the ingredients. Someone told me they got sick from CBD oil and they showed me the ingredients: "ayurvedic herbs"  That's all it said! Totally crazy. If there's more than like 5 ingredients in the juice it's not going to be worth it

279 2018-09-04 23:22:43 About to upload my video. Broke out the canola oil. Ya mofos got cooked 
280 2018-09-04 23:22:34 When you put climate change on the scales with the welfare of the oil patch, the oil patch loses badly. Nobody outside of 2 western provinces wants a western Canadian oil industry.

282 2018-09-04 23:22:09 No stream today. My neck is completely outta whack, sitting up hurts and I'm currently using some CBD Oil on it and taking a muscle relaxant to hopefully feel better tomorrow for stream and more commission work!
283 2018-09-04 23:22:05 I couldn’t even get it like that out of the vinegar one. Looked like cookin oil when it sets
284 2018-09-04 23:21:40 i bought lip tint oil and my life has changed
285 2018-09-04 23:21:28 That moment when you realize people still think oil for your gas comes from dead dinosaurs when even science has admitted that it's not true and it's a scam to control money fluctuations and wars.

288 2018-09-04 23:20:49 @AdamJoshDotCom Tonight's vegan fare: Lentil pilaf with Farro whole grain (ancient wheat) which results in a bulgur consistency. Italian herbs, sea salt (Celtic Grey), garlic, onions, olive oil and a dash of vinegar to break down the lentil casings and cut down on gassiness.
289 2018-09-04 23:20:38 Sir, I don't know anyone that even knows about this book.  Just keep on doing what you are doing and we'll be happy.  btw.  Please see what you can do about the high price of oil.
290 2018-09-04 23:20:28 Try tea tree oil things or like citrus stuff 
291 2018-09-04 23:20:10 The US is interested more in nations with real resources we have no raw material. Therefore compared to the states and their driven economy have sector base economics by raw material, oil, natural gas, etc and our raw material is depleted. We need to nationalize our lumber and
292 2018-09-04 23:20:04 So yeah, this morning my car wouldn't start without a jump, then there was work, then had to deal with momma and her errands, my low oil indicator came on, and now I should stretch my back but I'm tired haha.
293 2018-09-04 23:20:01 That moment you waited 3 hours for an oil change but they finished an hour and half ago but forgot to tell you  good thing I don't have a life
294 2018-09-04 23:19:59 I’m in Texas. Hold do I know if I’m getting good quality CBD oil from these smoke shops????
295 2018-09-04 23:19:42 Canada is our biggest supplier of oil!  If I cancel NAFTA the proportionality clause that makes Canada supply oil to us even if they are short will be null and void.  I 'm sure China doesn't want any Canadian oil...maybe I shouldn't tweet my every stupid thought.
296 2018-09-04 23:19:38 There is no choice...who cares if the bottom line is a profit. Two years of selling oil at market price will pay for itself. The profit comes with opening up the market not the pipelines profit

302 2018-09-04 23:18:39 I just sautéed some garlic sriracha seasoned chik’n in coconut oil, threw it in some brown quinoa added lotsss of spinach & made a peanut butter & soy sauce Thai dressing. Like wow, my mind...

305 2018-09-04 23:18:23 This SHOULD be last nail in the coffin of the oil patch.
306 2018-09-04 23:18:17 Well well well!  Alberta wake the HELL UP! The PM is the absolute worst ever. He hates Oil & now proves it as he rewards the back stabber Horgan. @RachelNotley  should be outraged!
307 2018-09-04 23:18:10 I was just saying how I want a honey turkey hoagie extra oil and vinegar 
308 2018-09-04 23:17:54 Some synthetic oil bullshit
309 2018-09-04 23:17:42 I think I’m cursed or the car is possessed I went to get an oil change and it turns out there was water in the door and because of that I had to get a new amplifier and door lock nobody could figure out where the water came from
310 2018-09-04 23:17:39 You'd know better than I would Glen, but I thought I read somewhere that in NAFTA, as it stands now, U.S. gets dibs on Canadian oil. It was a percentage if I remember correctly.
311 2018-09-04 23:17:31 Chef Louis cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with Play-Doh.
312 2018-09-04 23:17:14 You sound like an analyst, but ‘decoupling’ is the perfect word. Reminds me when the price of natural gas decoupled from crude oil.
313 2018-09-04 23:17:12 My oil change is $80 ... smh

320 2018-09-04 23:15:51 If NAFTA fails it won’t be from Canada that oil comes from.
321 2018-09-04 23:15:43 there's plenty of compassion. i have kids and worry daily that it could happen to them. Not on my watch though.

349 2018-09-04 23:12:58 You tried the tax-cutting fetish under your last leader. All it got us was a massive increase in the debt and tens of billions added to the pockets of millionaires and multinationals. How about some economic proposals that actually lower total debt?

353 2018-09-04 23:12:44 An electric car doesn’t care where the electricity comes from. Just like a gasoline car doesn’t come where the oil and electricity comes from to refine it into gasoline. Did you know there are many ways to make electricity?
354 2018-09-04 23:12:33 watch the video--why Guttenburg was then pointing and gesturing at Kavanaugh...not friendly stuff!

359 2018-09-04 23:12:09 I think he only opposes our independence because he wants our oil, he was talking about a sovereign wealth fund (a British one not a Scottish one). 90% of the money goes to England we get the scraps
360 2018-09-04 23:12:03 Rowdy Tellez deserves a cup of coffee with the Blue Jays for so many reasons beyond just his name. Although as far as names go, he’s already made my all-time list with the likes of Rusty Kuntz, Cannonball Titcomb, and Oil Can Boyd.
361 2018-09-04 23:11:49  has its own oil.   No need to buy it elsewhere.
362 2018-09-04 23:11:35 Hhmmmm....I beg to differ. Lobbying to make hemp illegal so oil and gas was profitable...and the oil and gas industry hasn’t changed very much over the years. Have you researched how much they give legislators?

376 2018-09-04 23:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
377 2018-09-04 23:09:36 Again, if you would actually review the project beyond your shallow talking points you would realize it gets oil off higher GHG transportation sources like trains. If your goal is to help the environment you should be cheering for our crude to displace places like Venezuela.

381 2018-09-04 23:08:06 That's WAY out there. I guess if that is all they got, they gotta run with it.
382 2018-09-04 23:07:48 Ffs why?  We are sitting on oil.  Stop putting up barriers to refine it and ship it.
383 2018-09-04 23:07:47 I recently discovered rosehip oil and the results for acne scarring are amazing. Definitely going to check out some other things on your list

393 2018-09-04 23:05:39 Volume/turnover I think. Not impressed by the article. Shanghai crude oil contract (as a credible buy-side contract) is interesting & potentially disruptive, but there has been a combination of ill informed commentary & memes based upon fundamental misconceptions & ideology.
394 2018-09-04 23:05:35 The campaign against emissions has nothing to do with emissions. Don’t be silly. It has everything to do with money & politics. No amount of research to show Canada to be an effective ecological steward will make a difference. How dare the nice guys also be 3rd largest oil holder
395 2018-09-04 23:05:28 @elonmusk is has a clear vision of what the future of humanity needs. Tesla - shifting away from oil. SpaceX - the exploration of other planets. OpenAI - using artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. @drpamelapark

406 2018-09-04 23:04:03 No. A person with a gun who shoots people is a very real danger. A guy who was vetted and passed through security in the Senate is no risk to anyone. Except in your fantasy dreams.

415 2018-09-04 23:02:40 It’s a lot going on during this oil change
416 2018-09-04 23:02:37 No it doesn’t, it’s the basics they look for : windscreen, seatbelt, tyres, lights, oil and air leaks.
417 2018-09-04 23:02:34 Get yourself some safflower oil. It has a wicked high smoke point.
418 2018-09-04 23:02:21 Let me repeat myself...oil and gas is dying. Not sure how else to explain this. Banks & entire countries are divesting. Many countries have banned fracking as well as 3 states. There’s no need for residential drilling. Period.
419 2018-09-04 23:02:11 Bad thing about Pennsylvania in the summer is the fucking mosquitos. At least we don't fucking catch malaria from these fuckers here. I need my lemongrass oil and I left that shit at home.
420 2018-09-04 23:02:10 Good lord.  Sheer is NOT for: 
Carbon Tax, stupid social justice NAFTA demands, anti oil, ISIS terrorist reintegration nonsense, handgun ban for law abiding licensed citizens.

424 2018-09-04 23:01:20 That attempt at snark or sarcasm just did not carry much weight with the whole, can not get my facts straight thing. My guess, Miss Lindsey been burning some night oil, with visions of kompromat swinging above his bed.
425 2018-09-04 23:01:19 I’m not talking about the bilge tanks, I was referring to the oil or gas slick coming from the ship. You can see clearly in the bottom right pic.

428 2018-09-04 23:01:01 Between 1990 and 2012 the per bbl oilsands intensity dropped 28%, and even further since 2012. The total is going up because it's a growing industry. Oil and gas is targetted as well, there is a price on carbon emissions in Alberta.

I got my car inspection done at delta and paid for it but didn’t get a sticker so I thought it came in the mail (1st ever inspection btw) never got it so when I got a oil change 2 weeks later and they tell me I have a sticker when I don’t?

454 2018-09-04 22:56:33 It is good, look congress created debt under OIL BOND of Rs. 150,000 Cr, some has to pay it back, so why not ppl who has purchase the product in the past pay for it,Why other taxpayers have pick the tab. If any one responsible is Congress & their PM Mr. Sing for the hike today?

458 2018-09-04 22:55:57 I agree, but I still hated the mechanical oil drop more. I appreciate they were trying to do something different, but it was ugly af and too blue lol.

463 2018-09-04 22:55:15 75% of the adjustment in oil importers' CA will be likely done via reduction in imports and only 25% via increase in exports. The former should lead to a reduction in the surplus countries' CA; the latter to an increase in the US CA deficit

472 2018-09-04 22:53:36 CBD oil is already available in Utah for medical patients, I don't care one way or the other if medical marijuana is legalized but I do think they are correct in saying this is a way to get recreational mj legalised.

482 2018-09-04 22:52:04 The Anointing Oil according to the Bible is the products of extraction from four different spices mixed thoroughly inside the Olive Oil - Exodus 30:22 - 25
The application in summary is in what the Servant of God has passed through in total submission to Holy Spirit in prayer.

509 2018-09-04 22:49:44 Would have been good to hear about the kind of oils being used in cooking and on salads as this has a big impact on metabolism, not much good having a salad if it’s covered in a processed instead of a good olive oil #abcCatalyst

516 2018-09-04 22:49:05 Again, I disagree. Immediacy bias makes recent events seem more significant than past events particularly if we didn't live through those past events. I did & I assure you that offshore & later, deep water drilling seemed every bit as "revolutionary" as tight oil does today.

525 2018-09-04 22:47:06 I bet it has something to do with #oil and #cryptocurrency..
526 2018-09-04 22:46:48 I use it to reduce inflammation in the body and boost my immune system. It also helped cut down my sugar cravings and it keeps me satiated. It doesn’t taste good at all but it’s worth it. I only order from the Blessed Seed because they have the strongest oil on the market.
527 2018-09-04 22:46:44 Eating a salad of radish, white beans, feta and some oil/balsamic vinegar..... 

.... I don't know. I am far from a picky eater.. but beans are not my favourite thing.. especially canned and room temperature
528 2018-09-04 22:46:26 Getting more and more disappointed with @costcocanada.  Fewer and fewer products - especially things to get regularly, savings aren't there like they used to be, and only seasonal vegetarian soy products.  Mostly gimmicky junk and even snake oil salesmen these days :(
529 2018-09-04 22:46:21 I had to pour oil in it this time. I had forgotten to check the oil the last two times. Have to remember to do that!
530 2018-09-04 22:46:10 And this. It is incompatible to be a cat owner & genuinely love wildlife. What’s a few songbirds, voles, field mice & fledglings to worry about? (8 million cats in UK/4 million wild animals needlessly killed per day) that’s equiv to 100 oil tanker spills per day on birdlife in UK
531 2018-09-04 22:46:05 i always use olive oil but when i’m feelin WILD I will use olive oil AND butter and i’m always like “damn why does this taste so good”
532 2018-09-04 22:45:39 @fred_guttenberg whose using who to destroy the Supreme Court you are using your daughter to promote your liberal views on gun control remember she was killed in a GUN FREE ZONE with one deputy there that didn't do his job  and I have to believe you support Sheriff Israel
533 2018-09-04 22:45:25 COSMOPOLITAN: Often use an essential oil.
534 2018-09-04 22:45:22 I like platforms; the night lights look nice. Why are they more of an eyesore than condos? Unlike condos, it's not like we'll see nothing but platforms.

Litter is caused by litterers, not oil platforms.

The world would be WAY worse off without oil & plastic. Billions would die.

537 2018-09-04 22:45:03 800k scovilles and good taste beats 2M scovilles tastes like rancid motor oil
538 2018-09-04 22:45:02 Not one of his fans, but sadly I agree with exporting our oil elsewhere.
539 2018-09-04 22:44:57 My dumb ass usually cooks with cooking spray or a light coating of olive oil if I’m feeling wild. Butter is the best?????

550 2018-09-04 22:43:50 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. If UCF just sat back & accepted a concerted effort to keep them out of the espn invitational, then they'll never be allowed in. In any other ncaa sport an undefeated team would be the unanimous champions, which highlights the problem.

565 2018-09-04 22:41:18 And vacations... oil prices, geopolitical turmoil, hurricanes, OPEC, and collapse of Venezuela r still weighing over the gas though...  Then, the week ahead which starts today: automakers release sales numbers in August throughout day...

576 2018-09-04 22:40:38 I love combining lavender and peppermint oil in my diffuser for calm and focus. Great for writing sessions. To sleep, my favorite is Serenity by DoTerra (expensive though). Smells so good!
577 2018-09-04 22:40:27 いや……あと五問くらいだから許して……
578 2018-09-04 22:40:27 Mixing oil and water. Why do they insist they’ll become a solution?

588 2018-09-04 22:39:48 MAYO IS JUST EGG OIL
589 2018-09-04 22:39:46 taxing fossil fuels only increase the price beyond what a poor ppl can afford. It changes nothing. In fact, the oil firms make more cash selling to fewer people. Meanwhile the 'activists' are busy flying around in fuel-powered jets to conferences & getting grants from oil firms.
590 2018-09-04 22:39:32 Also baking soda and tree tea oil will help soothe it. It is systematic so the steroids will help. But I hate taking them too so I understand your hesitation.
591 2018-09-04 22:39:27 I thought this was settled and that we called them "oil drillers"?
592 2018-09-04 22:39:23 they better not be trying to take all day with this oil change either 
593 2018-09-04 22:39:23 I’m starving they need to hurry up with my oil change damnit
594 2018-09-04 22:39:16 Abuja sharing is the cause of laziness in the country and whenever oil prices dropped it's called economic melt down for everyone in the country
595 2018-09-04 22:39:14 Well said General !!
596 2018-09-04 22:39:10 Maybe you should stop using everything that comes as a result of oil...
Jagmeet Singh... the only person more divisive than junior
597 2018-09-04 22:39:08 To get an oil change i go to Walmart and it’s only 31 dollars  and they vacuum your carpets and fill up your coolant and washer fluid and checks everything for only 31 dollars
598 2018-09-04 22:39:07 Synthetic costs more. Once you go synthetic you can’t go back to using the regular oil

605 2018-09-04 22:38:13 I’ve never had an oil consumption problem. Maybe that’s people who buy Imprezas and think they are street racers.
606 2018-09-04 22:38:02 Actually Norway's oil companies are 50/50 public private partnership, but who wants to let facts get in the way of a good argument
607 2018-09-04 22:37:43 Good structure let to good institution my sister, let us restructure this nation for every components will have it institution on how to progress not this Abuja sharing of the oil money

610 2018-09-04 22:37:17 Errr why is the oil black

612 2018-09-04 22:36:56 Is there an oil size rig enema available?
613 2018-09-04 22:36:49 I think Erdogan is trying to survive till 2022 since later he can start extracting oil and the 100 year agreement ends . If turkey will be one of the oil gaint's .  Russia and turkey can control oil prices . Hence turkey will be a global player if they work with Russia.

623 2018-09-04 22:35:26 U cite the very places that took part in exterminating 6 million Jews and u cite a currently corrupt UN w/ members that cower to Arab oil influence. Most of those countries quietly thank Israel on my levels of geopolitical interest. U really don't know much about this subject.
624 2018-09-04 22:35:25 Adding salt is waste of time na..cut the thing direct into the oil
625 2018-09-04 22:35:19 In Paris you explained to reporters that CDA needed to transition away from oil, and then killed energy east, and provided funding to Trans pipe protesters, now your saying we need to access new markets?  exactly what is it that you support? I’m an educated man, you confuse me
626 2018-09-04 22:35:17 Didn’t know this was a legit thing, beard oil.
627 2018-09-04 22:35:07 Minion uses the lotion when she has been swimming regularly. 3 hours in the pool plus washing times comes to a lot of water and little oil left in her skin.
628 2018-09-04 22:34:57 The first bailout came from USA. The second bailout was needed because UK couldn't afford to repay the first bailout. Second bailout was funded by IMF, which was part funded by Germany and USA. New oil revenues rescued UK from that disaster and so only part of second loan needed.
629 2018-09-04 22:34:53 Go back to school oil, natural gas, and coal are natural occurring resources. Having judges legislate from the bench is over reach. We all want a clean enviroment but done effectively and efficient. Unlike the subsidies required to float green energy.
630 2018-09-04 22:34:39 I need to get an oil change and also my tire pressure light is on and my dad isn’t home from vacay yet so ima just die???? idk 
631 2018-09-04 22:34:11 Remember to use olive oil.
632 2018-09-04 22:34:08 @GameOverGreggy Beard dandruff—just use extra virgin coconut oil at the end of every shower, and leave it in. Just some, though (too much will be greasy).
633 2018-09-04 22:34:00 I love making an extra feta and olive oil version of Greek salad and using it as pasta sauce for rigatoni or penne. Nothing makes it pop like good tomates
634 2018-09-04 22:33:59 I just spritz my neck and wrists with honey mixed with rain water and cashew oil each morning in lieu of showering.
635 2018-09-04 22:33:35 YAY! I'm sure victims of the next climate change powered hurricane will be SO excited that the owners of big oil companies are making more money.

652 2018-09-04 22:31:57 and, we supply over 43% crude oil to the United States.  We are also one of the 10 countries that have the highest oil reserves in the world.  The U.S. did not make the list.  Should we sell our country to the U.S.?
653 2018-09-04 22:31:54 What does that have to do with you?

Your party is extremely against oil, gas and coal.

674 2018-09-04 22:27:25 Real support would be to build an oil terminal and start shipping Alberta oil through the Hudson's bay during the summer season or year round by building a dedicated ice breaker for escort of tankers year round.
675 2018-09-04 22:27:22 Of course, it happens all the time. Though in my case they want to dip me in boiling oil.

Until i said not yet satan.
And the flames instantly went out.
679 2018-09-04 22:27:11 Changed my life for the better, I use the Hemish cleansing balm or the L’Oreal Cleansing oil, both soooo good
680 2018-09-04 22:27:03 So I'm guessing you rate it 3 out of 5 burning Iraqi oil wells?
681 2018-09-04 22:27:01 You also eliminate system complexity which reduces maintenance issues and breakdown issues on top of the oil, antifreeze, transmission services, etc.  It just makes sense from an engineering standpoint
682 2018-09-04 22:26:42 The voice just expressed his hatred toward me” injected word” ,changing the oil on my vehicle/home hope he is not going to influence my mechanic same way he influences my lover and every body else!

694 2018-09-04 22:24:25 Meanwhile, 95% of the crude oil Canada imports comes from countries below us in the UN Sustainable Development Goals Index. Pipeline opponents are encouraging the world’s least sustainable practices.

709 2018-09-04 22:21:31 No the Feds have more skin in the game. It's not just the pipelines profit it's the increased price of oil. Kinder Morgan doesn't benefit from the increased sale price or the jobs etc. it will be profitable in the long term
710 2018-09-04 22:21:30 i could make a whole quesadilla on my forehead rn if i wanted to. I got a big ass forehead, it’s hot, and oil is leaking from my pores

714 2018-09-04 22:20:54 Yep, make standard oil etc look like failures........
715 2018-09-04 22:20:44 Being vegan and eating plant based diet are two different things. Being vegan IS about the oil isn’t vegan it’s just plant based friendly.
716 2018-09-04 22:20:44 the only essential oil is olive oil
717 2018-09-04 22:20:43 Smell like eww , sweat , & oil 
718 2018-09-04 22:20:42 It never ceases to amaze me how many "future" greenhouses gases are attributed to oil sands, but nobody says boo about other producers.

720 2018-09-04 22:20:38 I listened to some classical music while looking at traditional oil paintings today. You couldn't wipe the smile off of my face if you tried.
721 2018-09-04 22:20:37 (2/2)
Be slow and patient so you dont sploosh the oil
* start mixing by stabbing gently (this gets the oil down to the firmest/driest parts)
* next mix by twirling the knife/spoon
* once oil is less separated, stir until even, take care that the bottom is well mixed
722 2018-09-04 22:20:24 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

726 2018-09-04 22:20:06 Can you get fat eating salad with olive oil and vinegar??
727 2018-09-04 22:20:01 Hiya! Sorry just seeing this now, good you found it ok! It just looks as if it was kept too cold so the oil hardened  let us know if you have any other issues

732 2018-09-04 22:19:49 Looks like an oil painting rather than a photograph. I’m often asked what the components of golf design are, greens tees bunkers etc are the obvious answer LIGHT/SHADOW is the answer they don’t expect
733 2018-09-04 22:19:47 He's "outraged" over the death of his child. Protesting Kavanaugh makes sense to him. He did nothing wrong. Kavanaugh's an ass.

745 2018-09-04 22:18:11 I was the only person in the oil change facility wait room, so when the guy came in and called Alexis, I was confused. Like, nope, that’s not me... he said “You don’t drive a Lexus?”

And then I got it. A Lexus. Not Alexis. Oops.

757 2018-09-04 22:16:34 I was one of the ones fighting for your freedom. Never once did I think it was for oil.  I was over there fighting so the battle wasn’t fought on our land.

759 2018-09-04 22:16:27 Really? So the Left showed this by going after Obama and Hillary for using OUR TAX MONEY to fund radicals ranging from IED poppin' Wahhabis to outright Neo Fascists to topple governments over oil and gas contracts, where the resulting terror attacks killed MULTIPLE Americans  1/2
760 2018-09-04 22:16:18 Your ex-energy adviser just took a job in offshore drilling. The Swamp of oil-gas-coal thanks you again for your wonderful service for them--quite a change from Obama era when Interior worried about public lands & clean oceans.

779 2018-09-04 22:13:39 But that's just one useful application, not snake oil that can democratize any application :)
780 2018-09-04 22:13:24 Texarkana is a fraud, its spending exceeded the company assets or should I say states assets and you had to run to Federal government for DOD emergancy funding. Perhaps its time to cut the upper end pay checks and pay it to the people that buy products, that use oil.
781 2018-09-04 22:13:13 Partially hydrogenated oil will do that.

791 2018-09-04 22:11:51 Western discourse is inherently critical of any non democratic nation that does not financially incentivize it. Gulf states are playing ball with the west, they don’t like Israel. Israel is not an oil producing nation. Western politicians now critical of Israel. What changed?
792 2018-09-04 22:11:48 Getting an oil change makes me feel weird and I don’t know why. Maybe it’s the awkward waiting area.

804 2018-09-04 22:10:14 The average price of crude oil of Dr Manmohan Singh was $102.75 in his last 4 years and the average price of crude oil during Modis last four years is $  62.40 per barrel.
805 2018-09-04 22:10:13 It would be if Westmonster was still  distributing it. Just think what Scotland could do with 100% of its oil revenues. Look at Norway with a fraction of our reserves. One of the richest nations on Earth with a similar population

819 2018-09-04 22:08:53 We are near the end of this fiat currency cycle and the only way to keep it going is to constantly increase the money supply. This is why nothing is done about the use-it-or-lose-it spending. The fact that the dollar is pegged to World oil markets is also another reason why.
820 2018-09-04 22:08:47 Took a “88mg” dose of #THC in the form of LP oil yesterday. Guess I’ll try “110mg” today and see if that does anything #Cannabis #quality
821 2018-09-04 22:08:39 @Valvoline got an oil change from a service center in Michigan. Less than 24 hrs later I was on the side of the road. Car overheated and transmission lock up. I have yet to hear back from customer service about this.
822 2018-09-04 22:08:29 YUP. Canada is doomed for the next year or so until we have an election in Alberta and Ottawa but who knows if the new politicians will be much better towards the oil sector and Alberta or Western Canada in general.

826 2018-09-04 22:07:59 Alright, I’m ready to get out of here, not so sure a cheap oil change is worth a fucking two hour wait.

834 2018-09-04 22:07:18 By way of example the record IPE Gas Oil monthly delivery I recall was about 800,000 tonnes (which was 8000 contracts) & that was epic, with traders swapping out of deliveries wherever possible because of congestion.

838 2018-09-04 22:06:41 If your going to do it, do it sooner rather than later or they’ll rob all that oil; just like they robbed the Welsh of their coal, copper and gold and is now one of the 5 poorest countries in the Eu.
839 2018-09-04 22:06:10 You’re bringing an oil based product to water boiling point, it will surely affect the other water and the egg shell is semipermeable. How do you make a stew?
840 2018-09-04 22:05:59 You know that What happens in Venezuela is pure dictatorship? Their socialist facade has been completely blown away with the corruption of Maduro. USA was actually parte of the problem because they were the Major buyers of chavez oíl. Now china has taken their place.

Say something about oil prices!
850 2018-09-04 22:04:00 Thought I was smart only putting factor 2 oil on today 
851 2018-09-04 22:03:57 Annoyed bc I spent my Sunday getting an oil change, tire rotation, and cleaning my car just so my car gives up on me on campus when I want to go home 
852 2018-09-04 22:03:55 Well a lot of regular garbage biodegrades. Plastic doesn't. I'm sure animals ingest other types of harmful waste, but the amount of plastics in oceans is HUGE. But yea oil spills are a huge issue as well, I have no disagreement there
853 2018-09-04 22:03:54 Lin, you can apply an organic pesticide, they won’t do much damage otherwise. Use a tablespoon of neem oil, one tablespoon blue dawn dish soap, combined mixture of alcohol and water .. only apply when the bees are not active
854 2018-09-04 22:03:46 I'm currently dosed up on night nurse, nasal spray, vapo rub and olbas oil. This is fantastic right now.
855 2018-09-04 22:03:43 Zange indincede mna. I also mixed it with coconut oil, sweet oil forgot the other oils but nothing..
856 2018-09-04 22:03:29 Ditto. I’m trying my hand at using oil pastels for the first time in about 24 yrs...
857 2018-09-04 22:03:23 And don't forget to mention how @RepRobBishop and @RepJenniffer are trying to make #PuertoRico dependent on natural gas instead of advocating for 100% renewables all bc Bishop receives lots of $$$ from gas and oil to help fund his campaign.
858 2018-09-04 22:03:19 Yelling, loud calls, man moving up quick and security stepped in... you democrats have become the worlds top drama queens.
859 2018-09-04 22:03:14 There are severe logistical constraints on oil deliveries. To take delivery you need storage: to make delivery you need to charter & load vessels. There are limits on rates of loading & discharge, availability of berths, & inspectors etc etc #OOTT
860 2018-09-04 22:03:14 There is no way you die ridiculously sick in Canada

I started communicating with this female doctor right from Nigeria

She is so nice, beautiful, young and caring, Infact the way she handled me makes me feel I should just allocate an oil block if I owned some at my disposal

863 2018-09-04 22:02:51 I bought an oil filterer and filtered all my oils twice a day so no little black bits either.  Does get tricky as the season changes as the potatoes have a higher sugar content so brown quicker but still need same cooking time
864 2018-09-04 22:02:17 No more blood for oil. We got our own battle to fight on our own soil.

868 2018-09-04 22:01:55 You eat the tuber, it’s potato like but with a gamey taste, best roasted or chopped in a stew, can also be 1cm sliced and shallow fried in olive oil, serve with lemon

870 2018-09-04 22:01:44 Good job Chris, you forgot the olive oil
871 2018-09-04 22:01:31 “Boom” Not. Was increase in invest but it’s *all* big state projs like gas pipes to China &bridges to nowhere. Not “real” invest by real bizmen building real biz. Take away oil money state invest & you got stagnation. But that’s Russia’s thing: it does have that oil money, eh?
872 2018-09-04 22:01:24 Again as part of any financial arrangement, make China buy our crude oil if they're not buying atm and make them buy even MORE if they're already buying from us.....

877 2018-09-04 22:00:55 I have Essential Tremors. I made a mistake and forgot to order my CBD oil. No big deal I thought. Couldn't walk or slow my tremors for 2  days. To top it off I fell and I haven't for a month since taking it. At 68 I can't risk falling believe me. It also stops my back pains.
878 2018-09-04 22:00:40 We had our Oil service special last month. What would you like to see us do for this month? Remember us for all your automotive needs give us a call 4109570050.
879 2018-09-04 22:00:33 I'm sorry but I will break it to you: olive oil is the most used thing for cooking in Europe. It is also used for dressing, yes, but most fried things are done with olive oil. At least in Portugal, Spain and Italy.

894 2018-09-04 21:58:34 @sambitswaraj @rajnathsingh @PrakashJavdekar @SushmaSwaraj now you people are running the govt & crude oil price are much cheaper to compare 2013/14 but Fuel prices are much higher now compare to past. Would you like to comment now on this as you all did for previous Govt
895 2018-09-04 21:58:16 business is not welcome in BC  Canada, we hate companies and businesses, we will hassle you until you close your business. We hate businesses/autos/manufactures/low prices/oil/gas/etc. we love open air/high prices and protesters.
896 2018-09-04 21:58:15 — is an absurd and conspiratorial thing to blame it on. They continue to run dozens of stories about how harmful the oil industry is, how we should abandon it for cleaner energies etc. Not something they would do if they were in the pocket of some oil/gas company.
897 2018-09-04 21:58:11 but how many actually believed they were in a foreign land fighting for your freedom and not for protecting oil interests. 
898 2018-09-04 21:58:09 Rumble them clean wash them, chip them wash them several times, add a drying agent, drain and dry, oil up to 180 par fry, drain and store,cook as needed in small batches to keep heat up for a perfect chip

901 2018-09-04 21:57:56 LOL funny #fakenews
902 2018-09-04 21:57:55 and then the bus runs out of oil 
903 2018-09-04 21:57:50 We have the same problem here in the UK! Inflation is growing faster than wages. Energy bills are rising due to the US$ being so strong against the GB£! Trump is to blame for fuel price increase over his sanctions on Iran and other oil producing countries!

904 2018-09-04 21:57:47 Protect your oil.
905 2018-09-04 21:57:27 To give you an example of why options are good even for that stuff: some people like artichokes in oil because they taste better. But packing them in oil also makes them a lot more fattening. So some prefer them packed in water.
906 2018-09-04 21:57:26 Fair enuf. Better to say it’s doing better than expected. But that’s part due to high than expected oil price.
907 2018-09-04 21:57:09 Not any better off when half the population’s under water. I don’t disagree about how we’ve been treated in the past, but appealing to oil greed is not a good strategy going forward.
908 2018-09-04 21:57:06 It’s a story dimwit. He daughter was murdered . He walks up to the judge and the judge blows him off.
What if the killer was an illegal immigrant and it was a liberal judge? Would it be a story then?
909 2018-09-04 21:57:04 —TYT in regards to the situation. If they didn't run the story & Ana truly did give some sort of statement that they would, I'm guessing they didn't because either there were elements of the story that they couldn't verify or didn't check out. Some dubious tie to an oil company -

914 2018-09-04 21:56:42 Tried scheduling a tune-up for my @Volkswagen car and the mechanic couldn't tell me how much a diagnostic is, didn't know if they will have to change the oil or how much oil costs because it's a separate company that does it and the price varies for everyone. Total nightmare...
915 2018-09-04 21:56:40 Lucy:  try slicing them thinly and use a mandoline slicer on some fennel..  mix together and toss with a bit of oil and seasoning..throw some parchment on a baking sheet and roast.  You’ll change your mind about brussels forever.
916 2018-09-04 21:56:17 you shouldnt oil pasta before you put sauce on because the sauce won’t stick. add it on top at the end. duh.
917 2018-09-04 21:55:51 Nonsense. Offshore oil drilling & production doesn't hurt the coast or marine life. In fact it helps marine life. The platforms are unparalleled excellent reefs. But banning offshore drilling hurts jobs and the cost of living, which wealthy nimby eco-commies don't care about.
918 2018-09-04 21:55:49 Lately, we are not protecting America. We are protecting the wants of the elite (oil, pilfering, gold, religious based wars)
919 2018-09-04 21:55:42 The CBD oil def works!!! Geez two drops of the oil knocked me out in like 10 minutes into a coma! I should’ve only used 1

921 2018-09-04 21:54:57 Why are car places always so fucking sketchy. Like I don’t need all this extra shit just change the fucking oil.
922 2018-09-04 21:54:41 That smell. That eucalyptus oil scent right after an intense session. It stays with me even now. Years later. Jesus. All this time later. That scent immediately takes me back to you. That scent. It kills.

946 2018-09-04 21:51:32 no, when bleaching; you typically want your hair to be clean so the bleach can process better. If you apply coconut oil to your hair BEFORE you bleach, it'll process all blotchy and uneven. Having clean hair or dirty hair doesnt do anything bad.

954 2018-09-04 21:50:26 Would have much preferred it without the oil spill on the front. Why do Nike do this? It's so lazy.
955 2018-09-04 21:50:14 It's worse than that. Exploiting shale oil via fracking means that all the other oil resources are significantly depleted. And since the Bakken is already at the infill stage with significant water cut and a high Gas/Oil ratio, Permian is the last gasp.
956 2018-09-04 21:50:10 Don't use canola, it's bad for you. Olive oil is very beneficial to health.

962 2018-09-04 21:49:45 Come on, Stockwell. It is clearly not true that the Federal govt doesn't want to ship oil to the world. But it is also true that there are concerns by many people in doing that. #pnpcbc
963 2018-09-04 21:49:42 @Midas  you stink! I took my 4Runner in to get a full synthetic oil change and they sold me on a buy one get one free.  In the meantime I traded in my vehicle so I took the paperwork avd ID in with my spouses car.  They would not honor it.  I’ll never be back!!!

973 2018-09-04 21:48:39 The chart shows there has been economic growth over most years, except in mid 1970's which followed oil crisis where most of world was in recession, early 1980's which was mainly due to domestic economic policy, early 1990's the same and 2008 world financial crisis.

983 2018-09-04 21:47:28 to protest and to demand their rights. They pay taxes I assume and these taxes are supposed to deliver services. And what about all that oil? Where does the money go? Invest in solar panels, green energy and deliver services to the people. They elected you.
984 2018-09-04 21:47:27 Well said but for many many people, a Mediterranean diet is not affordable. Have you seen the cost of olive oil and fish...
985 2018-09-04 21:47:26 Kinda difficult but okay over all. Managed to get a really nice roommate . I swear most of my time goes by washing the clothes .. and the cook puts so much oil in the food  I swear they are spending my hostel fees on bad quality oil
986 2018-09-04 21:47:20 Exactly. Including resources derived from oil.
987 2018-09-04 21:47:08 The real average hourly wage dropped by two cents to $ 10.76. Above all, the oil prices are to blame, so fuel prices increased by 50 cents per gallon
988 2018-09-04 21:46:57 Do you even know what oil is used for? It is pretty damn shocking you falsely equate oil with wind, solar, etc
989 2018-09-04 21:46:55 gotta dip the crust in the olive oil
990 2018-09-04 21:46:48 Take a cotton swab and put the tiniest bit of baby oil on it then gently rub only on the sticker parts!
991 2018-09-04 21:46:45 I caught, though, a little sneer of disgust, and that hrumph attitude that says he can’t be bothered to be empathetic. And he has been a judge at high levels?! His heart needs a can of oil to get it beating again.
992 2018-09-04 21:46:45 That's why I say dollars are priced in oil. But if US has indeed linked $ to #OilStandard oil & dollar would fall together which would act against China mercantilism
993 2018-09-04 21:46:36 @JuliaHB1 People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. 

Obviously you’re not the same size as Tess Holliday, but let’s face it, you’re no oil painting, unlike Tess Holliday.
994 2018-09-04 21:46:27 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
995 2018-09-04 21:46:23 You are looking at it the wrong way: 
Moving from a growth of 1.2 mb/d to -0.4 mb is a decline of 1.6 mb/d 
That was the difference between +$120 oil and $35/b 
Remember: everything is determined at the margin! Not on the average!
996 2018-09-04 21:46:19 I can try raspberry leaf tea  but not doing castor oil or primrose oil

998 2018-09-04 21:46:08 My car needs another oil change so excuse me while I just lay here until that somehow fixes itself
999 2018-09-04 21:46:04 Farligare med globalister som säljer ut sitt land. Btw, Lundin Oil "donerade" 100 miljoner dollar till Clinton/Giustra foundation, o sen var det fritt fram att utvinna olja i en krigszon. Jobbat tillsammans med Soros EFTER att han kraschade svenska valutan. Puke.

1012 2018-09-04 21:44:31 It won’t but it’s a good start to give Canada access to world market. Singh has suggested we purchase our oil else where during the whole dispute between Saudi Arabia and Canada, why make us so depended on other nations .
1013 2018-09-04 21:44:29 Been getting a oil change since 3 wtf bruh

We need cooking oil nani
1016 2018-09-04 21:43:59 Heat up some red pepper flakes in some olive oil (like a sauce) and put it in a jar and then everything you cook in that oil will be slightly spicy
1017 2018-09-04 21:43:42 Durex engine oil is very good particularly for Toyota.
1018 2018-09-04 21:43:26 this pic smell like a diesel oil change and warm beer
1019 2018-09-04 21:43:17 Use Wild Willys Rub. The recipe can be found on Weber Bullet sight. Nothing better than smoked wings and using olive oil instead of butter makes it health food.
1020 2018-09-04 21:43:09 The taste of a good quality olive oil turns me on. My Italian ass.

1027 2018-09-04 21:42:33 On impulse I picked up oil paints, canvas, and all@the necessities to start painting my girlfriend artwork. 

I don’t know how to feel about that.
1028 2018-09-04 21:42:33 Started taking CBD oil a few days ago and already 100% reccomend.

1030 2018-09-04 21:42:13 Look Pierre, they just demonstrated again how much they care for our own gas & oil. It is undeniable how disrespectful this government is to our country but mostly #Alberta ,, sickening.
1031 2018-09-04 21:42:12 Ima pray on myself with the oil later
1032 2018-09-04 21:41:48 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1033 2018-09-04 21:41:47 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1034 2018-09-04 21:41:31 I sense oan out pouring to night,
Father am ready for  fresh oil..
1035 2018-09-04 21:41:25 I think Scotland is biding its time to prove to Scots that there is no option but independence. There would be no issue with using sterling till the country is ready to establish its own currency or even accept the Euro. Oil traded in Euro would be very attractive for the EU.
1036 2018-09-04 21:41:19 It's hard to find fire oil at reasonable prices, good thing I know the secret spot  #ifknowyouknow
1037 2018-09-04 21:41:18 My oil changes really a 100 fuckin dollars.  why wtf. This is so hurtful
1038 2018-09-04 21:41:17 Global Civilization is going to collapse around or even b4 2030.

Economic recession looms under trump which will become depression with extreme events happening now n ramping up.

Oil basically peaking now. 

Policy has to drive fossil shuttering anyway to even try tackling this
1039 2018-09-04 21:41:13 It’s Linguine, grape/cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, onion, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Just mix it all together with water, it’s really good. And it’s really easy to make too. If you google One Pan Pasta it should be easy to find exact measurements.
1040 2018-09-04 21:41:13 Oilsands is privatized and mostly foreign owned.    Trudeau should be asking the CEOs of the American oil companies in Alberta.

Why are you only selling to your countrymen?    #cdnpoli #NAFTA #oil
1041 2018-09-04 21:40:37 Actually American Citizens are sick and tired of the US bullying sovereign nations for Regime change for OIL and RESOURCES. All so MIC and the oligarchs can get richer while murdering millions. Utterly deplorable.

1044 2018-09-04 21:40:26 I saw some numbers & it was pretty minimal. Oil delivery is the exception, not the rule, on standardised futures markets (Brent is cash-settled vs an index) because it's a bloody pain. Trust me on this, I managed the IPE gas oil contract FOB ARA for 6 years.

1046 2018-09-04 21:40:12 The one page about light/oil as currency is both a brilliant abstraction and the most realistic explanation for an in-game currency I've read. It has become my benchmark for worldbuilding through mechanics.

1053 2018-09-04 21:39:34 .@RandPaul The Dems are mostly funded by Big Pharma, right?  The banks split between both parties.  And, oil leans right.  With a Republican majority, could we deregulate ALL drugs (including "illicit") and let people decide for themselves their best options for personal care?
1054 2018-09-04 21:39:33 They valued Colombia = $18.4 million 
and Argentina $89.1 Million

The combined assets said $100 Million #PENYF

If they lose Colombia. They still need $ to develop "Sur"

#Cruzsur is focused on barrels found in Argentina. 

Peso is 50% lower than 1 year ago. Needs this Oil
1055 2018-09-04 21:39:15 What oil tô pull with 
1056 2018-09-04 21:39:13 Both are related to the international events and nothing to do with BJP.

All currencies including Euro, Pound are weaker against the Dollar.

Crude oil prices are going up in the global market.
1057 2018-09-04 21:38:54 Me= OIL & Them= WATER
1058 2018-09-04 21:38:48 Surely the headline on the Surrey oil drilling story should have been 'Sunshine on Leith Hill'
1059 2018-09-04 21:38:47 I highly suggest that one. My aunt's a  Veterinarian and she suggest CBD oil it helps them so much. And it's natural.
1060 2018-09-04 21:38:47 Seriously SAME! Put peppermint oil in my vaporizer so I could breathe through the night  Worth it.
1061 2018-09-04 21:38:41 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts grape seed oil with 1 part lime juice and 1 part almond butter. Add chili peppers and honey to taste.
1062 2018-09-04 21:38:38 Wait, what? Did he really think Kavanaugh wouldn't have security? Is the fact that he didn't shake Mr. Guttenberg's hand supposed to change people's mind about him? And if he had shaken his hand, what would that do? I don't get the logic here.
1063 2018-09-04 21:38:35 I can dance.
1064 2018-09-04 21:38:05 Do essential oil diffusers really help calm you down and stuff like that?? I'm interested in buying one but don't know if they really work besides the smell
1065 2018-09-04 21:38:05 Not during a Supreme Court hearing.
1066 2018-09-04 21:38:00 my uncle, a pharmacist, recommended oil of cloves for my impacted wisdom teeth years ago
1067 2018-09-04 21:37:44 I bleach my hair a lot and coconut oil really helps. You'll still get damage from the bleach but much less so
1068 2018-09-04 21:37:39 As one of the 8000 oil/gas workers impacted by the court decision on the Kinder Morgan expansion I was totally insulted by Minister Sohi’s answers and knowledge of the situation as interviewed by Vassy Kapelos
1069 2018-09-04 21:37:38 Reminds me of a snake oil peddler!
1070 2018-09-04 21:37:07 Such a difference between him and the parents of Molly Tibbetts.
1071 2018-09-04 21:36:52 gallons of water, bananas, kale & spinach, oats, pasta, bread, almonds, rice, beans, lentils, seasoning, potatoes, if I can olive oil
1072 2018-09-04 21:36:47 I haven't watched the documentary yet, I was informed to watch. I'm assuming this will be in regards to a lack of an Oil fund given the synopsis?
1073 2018-09-04 21:36:41 消費税増税容認してる時点で

1074 2018-09-04 21:36:28 But the Trans Mountain is not being expanded for oil to be processed in Canada. It’s expansion will not reduce our need for foreign oil at all.
1075 2018-09-04 21:36:27 I used coconut oil daily from the time I found out I was pregnant. I didn’t get any stretch marks at all. But my baby was also small and I vomited a lot during the whole pregnancy.
1076 2018-09-04 21:36:25 Trump is a con man, a snake oil salesman. His brightly painted wagon is gold-plating.
1077 2018-09-04 21:36:04 Surely you don't still believe the Liberals in Ottawa are really interested in getting oil moving again. Remember PM Trudeau in Davos, has he really changed his view?
1078 2018-09-04 21:36:01 Of course They planned it all they knew security wouldn’t let him near him
1079 2018-09-04 21:35:58 Bitumen is an inferior product, and no one in Asia wants it when they can easily get crude oil or refined petroleum from Russia, Saudi Arabia or the US.
1080 2018-09-04 21:35:52 I like Greek salad.  Ingredients: large sliced leek, round top sirloin steak, thinly sliced celery, white pepper, bay, raisin, grated parmesan cheese, olive oil, cornstarch, and kidney bean.
1081 2018-09-04 21:35:46 It *is* all connected.  We still don’t know why west TX rep Kay Grainger went to Russia with all those senators.  And this Zina chick’s family is from west TX - which usually means oil.  I smell a possible Rosneft connection.

1084 2018-09-04 21:35:30 It was right to get rid of him, we didn't kill them and if you are going to join a death cult like ISIS that's on you. It wasn't about oil otherwise we'd go into Canada.
1085 2018-09-04 21:35:26 Try the CBD oil!!!
1086 2018-09-04 21:35:25 It’s a new form of propaganda. The Democrats set it up, the “free, independent” media promulgates it.

1124 2018-09-04 21:31:54 I’m surprised the US army hasn’t invaded my face considering how much mf oil it produces
1125 2018-09-04 21:31:52 U can take any kind like chicken breast or wings & if you put it in a cake pan and season it with salt and pepper & oil put it in the oven at 350 for how ever long it takes to cook chicken you get really good grilled chicken or even wings. Pretty basic & simple.
1126 2018-09-04 21:31:47 Imagine if we stopped shipping cheap oil to US and their gas prices started going up to the levels we have to pay for imported oil from middle east.  Trump would be out the door on his ass.
1127 2018-09-04 21:31:46 We also need to reduce and eliminate oil by rail as well as stopping new pipelines.  Oil by rail can increase at a much slower rate than new pipelines will allow.  Oil by rail is still a threat.
1128 2018-09-04 21:31:44 How do I apply for snowplow operator? I was out of town working in the oil fields of North Dakota when I was informed of your openings. Please let me know if there's anything still required of me
1129 2018-09-04 21:31:27 Nope. Doesn't mean it was right to invade a country, destabilize the government, kill ~1,000,000 people, create the ground work for ISIS, and more just for some oil.
1130 2018-09-04 21:31:20 If this sun wants to fry someborri it should just talk lemme rub oil on my body

1139 2018-09-04 21:30:34 I'm headed to the grocery store to flirt with the roasting chickens. I'm going to woo them with talk of kosher salt and a olive oil massage. They like that. They'll crawl into the roasting pan on their own if you talk to them like that.
1140 2018-09-04 21:30:32 Having owed a fish and chip shop

1147 2018-09-04 21:29:59 The Guy that asked for refund blocked me, you people should tell him to unblock me please. Bani na kar zomon ba rataya aka bani 
1148 2018-09-04 21:29:58 I would shutdown oil exports to the US as quickly as I could build pipelines east and west as well a a new dedicated twin railway east or west to the ports or even to Churchill Manitoba for summer shipping of oil as well. It would help the railroad up there as well.
1149 2018-09-04 21:29:57 Brought my car in for my annual oil change they no oil change needed but brake fluid. Picked up car n shortly light goes on they say rear brake module broke trying 2 charge me really?
1150 2018-09-04 21:29:55 Hey my mates in the US!
I hear you have a snake oil salesmen running the country, promises everything and delivers nothing. A FAKE president! So SAD!
1151 2018-09-04 21:29:40 Sanchez dude .energy , not well today for many of my #oil 
1152 2018-09-04 21:29:38 How does that work?
1153 2018-09-04 21:29:38 Trying to sleep with 2 bend ribs is not fun Need more pain killers and maybe a shot to knock me out. Oil and stairs doesn't make a good mix
1154 2018-09-04 21:29:18 Had mine early after op & treatment for endometriosis. Hot flushes the worst thing but advised to drink water each time to shorten duration. That, & E.P. oil helped me. Had aura & still get it sometimes.
1155 2018-09-04 21:29:03 Drink more kookaid hon.  You are sucking it down like air.  All the disruption in that room and you really think he knew who that man was.  Even so, as a school shooting survivor, this man is politicizing his child's death.  My heart hurts for him in his loss, unimaginable.
1156 2018-09-04 21:28:55 Bio oil for sure!
1157 2018-09-04 21:28:32 What are you winning bringing back old Jobs that we the ppl don't want, nice meet you Lobbyists Greg. U doing good helping Oil Corporations. Keep hurting Environment and Animals, Troll doesn't even care.
1158 2018-09-04 21:28:19 Maybe they should stop taking sponsors away from teams and making them “official” partners of NASCAR. Why sponsor one car and one driver when you can be the official drink or oil or snack food of the entire sport.
1159 2018-09-04 21:28:08 It’s truly sad to see him exploits the death of his child in such a fashion.  I know he’s acting out of pain but it’s still disturbing to see
1160 2018-09-04 21:28:06 I really hate paying for oil changes ... I know the car needs it but every time I hate it
1161 2018-09-04 21:28:05 Yea but how many barrels of oil does the world need per day if humankind no longer needs gasoline?
1162 2018-09-04 21:27:38 I’m really not even tripping though because full synthetic oil is not cheap
1163 2018-09-04 21:27:38 All o wanted was to eat fried chicken and sticky rice and papaya salad but ended up almost burning down my apartment and spilling hot oil all over the floor

1168 2018-09-04 21:26:17 This is one facet of the service model ICE dealers love. $15 for oil. (they buy bulk), $30 for jr. mechanic, overhead $5. pretax profit $200
1169 2018-09-04 21:26:12 So it was the US oil embargo that was shooting the people on the streets -but you cannot build the socialist paradise with out killing some comrades
1170 2018-09-04 21:26:02 Had a girl use the term “this guy changed my oil this weekend” and she most definitely wasn’t talking about her car 
1171 2018-09-04 21:25:58 Ayse, cut the brussels in half, place in a bowl or plastic bag, marinate in 1TBLs of good olive oil, 1tsp of garlic powder. salt , pepper, mix well. Place them face down on baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes on 400 degrees F, turn after 10 minutes and BINGO
1172 2018-09-04 21:25:25 Try orange blossom oil too
1173 2018-09-04 21:25:11 But these OIL BONDS were the half story.
Below were the subsidies that were forced on OMCs by UPA2.

Total Under  Recoveries b/w 2006-2009 were 315853 cr while the purchased Raw crude worth 1612096 cr.

About 20% of loss + Salaries,process cost ,which only increased till 2014
1174 2018-09-04 21:25:05 I’m like 85% sure the vape cartridges my guy sold me the last 2 times have been cbd oil
1175 2018-09-04 21:25:01 And the Oil Crisis was a big scam . As soon as the prices got high enough , there was plenty of oil .
1176 2018-09-04 21:24:59 congratulations! if oil is your preferred market, then drill baby drill! for myself, i'm only interested in shipments of gold h/t @veitchtweets
1177 2018-09-04 21:24:55 New tires and an oil change today. I’m doin shit out here.
1178 2018-09-04 21:24:38 I've a better idea ! Elect @jeremycorbyn as PM 
Stop bombing the shit out of other countries for oil 
and most of the immigrants could stay in their own homes,
#JC4PM = better world for all except the Arms dealers !

1181 2018-09-04 21:24:01 it is really too bad that the Alberta refinery was not a little more important to Canadians, you know, for the greater good of our people. Exporting our oil does not benefit the people it only puts money into Government coffers. Canadian oil should be fueling Canada.
1182 2018-09-04 21:23:59 Oil question of the day.  Right now, WTI fetches $51.87 barrel in the Permian (Midland) and $77.88 bbl in the North Sea.  What happens first? Permian dips below $50 bbl or Brent tops $80 bbl? Or both?
1183 2018-09-04 21:23:51 But in fact that's even more because you should ponder in cash flows (finance 101) and the cash flow of Total  (like all big oil or utility companies) is far less than their net result  (check on the AR). So in terms of cash flow that's more a 5 %. Anyway NOT greenwashing 
1184 2018-09-04 21:23:36 im dancing to your every breathe you take

1185 2018-09-04 21:23:28 go to the north and see how Chinesse are taken away our sesame seeds and cashew nuts which are then turned into oil....go to plateau state and see how these people are illegally mining our precious stones like gold, tin,diamond etc...chinese are the worst set of human races
1186 2018-09-04 21:23:25 If you haven't watched the highlights of todays confirmation hearing you HAD BETTER TUNE IN AND WISE UP!! This is what will be in store for November. Especially when they lose. you better get a battle plan for your family. clean and oil your protection. stock up on ammo, etc.

1188 2018-09-04 21:23:17 I dont mean to say every soldier is evil. I never meant it as such. My husband is an ex-Nato soldier. 
But we fight not for our countries, but for drugs and for oil and they (not all) committed unspeakable crimes under the guise of war
1189 2018-09-04 21:23:15 Liberals exporting Canadian oil ? Is this a joke
1190 2018-09-04 21:23:06 Came to town to get an oil change and looks like these masani and cheiis had the same idea. This waiting room is boppin'- all these elders gossiping/laughing w/ each other. Makes me happy
1191 2018-09-04 21:22:52 The person siding with the story of twisting an awkward interaction, like not knowing someone tried to shake your hand and rushing away confused, and twisting it to be about someone's dead kid in an unrelated event is accusing someone of "spin"?.... 

Wat
1192 2018-09-04 21:22:35 Don't you worry about him.

1201 2018-09-04 21:21:38 economy by raising inflation with all the Bolivars you had, thus ensuring that you gain all the oil, have a bunch of people wanting to work for you now, you can basically corner the oil market, build an army, and then sell all the oil to the world.
1202 2018-09-04 21:21:37 Let's watch % of contracts settled in phys.  If CNY oil does anything like CNY gold, it's going to be interesting.  My guess is US already knows a significant % of phys will swing east, judging by severity & timing of sanctions on Iran, & "revisionist" label applied to CN & RU
1203 2018-09-04 21:21:36 put oil on ur fall before u take it and then sprinkle keef ontop

1207 2018-09-04 21:20:57 Lázaro Cárdenas and his successors (up to the present) did not perceive that Pemex, as a government agency, could never be the peer of market-financed and managed oil companies. So sad.

1209 2018-09-04 21:20:48 Im sure you won't ireland - but do not do it. They will sell you snake oil to further their own interests.

And they will lie as well - if they start promoting norway dont believe them. They will chuck it as soon as the vote is other, and destroy ireland with disaster capitalism
1210 2018-09-04 21:20:48 What’s Pakistan’s gdp anyways?  are there opportunities for improvement?  How much oil and coal does pak need annually?  How much food is produced?  Any economics major can help solve these issues.

1215 2018-09-04 21:20:13 it's not just about oil, it's the fact that Saudis invest worldwide in all sort of different  industries, as well as American businesses having a lot of money tied up in Saudi Arabia

1228 2018-09-04 21:18:40 Just like you probably had no clue that the oil pipeline passing through native American territory was set to badly contaminate their water supply.

That never made it to the news. So it must not matter right?

What crack are you smoking?

1233 2018-09-04 21:18:03 Good! When I had chronic anxiety all through 2016, mine looked like motor oil and didn't improve until I learned how to properly cope.
1234 2018-09-04 21:18:01 This dude on first dates hotel has so much beard oil on that it looks like he’s got a glitter beard
1235 2018-09-04 21:17:47 It wasnt oil. It was government incompetence. I cant give you proof because then i would be in violation of lika a dozen confidentiality agreements, but suffice to say they did the stupidest thing a country in economic crisis could do.
1236 2018-09-04 21:17:43 It's not the Bunion that's the problem.   It's creepy Hardeep's facile and sneering remarks that are so offensive.    Like he's some fucking oil painting himself. #CBBUK

1240 2018-09-04 21:17:33 Grinders are far better than Grnder. 

Especially with the olive oil they use in Groton.
1241 2018-09-04 21:17:25 Yes! Our data show in in NE Madagascar show that the most common uses were - 1. waterproofing flashlights for night fishing, 2. parts for sling shot building, 3. the reason you were thinking they are used for, and... wait for it.... 4. hair loss treatment (the oil).

1245 2018-09-04 21:17:14 Just bought an essential oil diffuser hopefully this will solve all my problems 
1246 2018-09-04 21:17:11 Maybe start under the hood? Learn about the battery, oil, etc. So you can get some basics 
1247 2018-09-04 21:17:02 Hes going on CNN tonight. He was very outspoken at that town hall too. Feel bad for him and what he and his family have been through but this all doesn't look good for him.... or CNN. Looks like this was all planned?
1248 2018-09-04 21:16:58 Ethanol. (Corn) Just like where I live we have more oil here so regular is cheaper.

This kind of optic twisting of facts is sickening.
1253 2018-09-04 21:15:51 It crossed my mind lol.  Happens every freaking fall... problem with living in the forest.  Thank goodness my oil trick works and they never make it inside or I would be torching this mofo
1254 2018-09-04 21:15:47 Futures volumes are deceptive. NYMEX WTI volumes were inflated by local market-makers. IPE Brent was a broked physical market until Wall Street/Big Oil ICE captured it & began to blow bubbles. To be successful Shanghai must build a regional forward physical contract market
1255 2018-09-04 21:15:47 what ends up happening is that the hair can’t actually take in moisture (from oil, the air, etc) so it gets dry

1260 2018-09-04 21:14:59 My olbas oil arrived today and it’s made me so excited! It’s such a comforting smell and gets me ready for cold weather even if it’s still hot... it’s September its basically winter so 
1261 2018-09-04 21:14:57 This is my life, too! I never had any skin problems as a teen but now that I'm in my late twenties, it is oil and blemish city! 
1262 2018-09-04 21:14:39 That's lovely to know + thank you for it, but we've had enough of Westminster ignoring our wishes, humiliating our MPs, squandering our oil, imposing Rape Clause on us, taking us out of EU, subjecting us to smear after smear from their propaganda MSM +treating us like a colony.
1263 2018-09-04 21:14:31 Everytime a cat poops, I miss my oil diffuser.
1264 2018-09-04 21:14:22 So you recognise no greenwashing. Now that is ANOTHER topic far too long for Twitter. But foods for thoughts: please read the IEA report entirely. Come back after and explain me how we will make a transition if big oil companies are not helping to... make the transition.
1265 2018-09-04 21:14:18 Who remembers the TV advert which said if you want to know about oil, ask a man who knows about engines. Ask Colin Chapman. Tim Martin is the Colin Chapman of today, the engine is our economy. The oil is freedom to grease whichever wheels we so please. I commend it to the house.
1266 2018-09-04 21:14:18 The pipeline twinning will triple capacity and that is where we come to 300 million per year plus the increased price for or oil...you don't think kinder Morgan was in it for feelings???
1267 2018-09-04 21:14:11 Inb4 "but -t MSNBC said he thinks thr president can never do anything wrong and is immune from everything."
1268 2018-09-04 21:14:09 Haven't been paying attention to them - why do you think suspension?
1269 2018-09-04 21:14:07 The squeaky wheel gets the oil

1273 2018-09-04 21:13:47 I have tried water based paints for nicotine stains before and it doesn’t do the job as good as a oil based. But would be interesting to know how you get on with that stuff as I have not tried it before.
1274 2018-09-04 21:13:29 bars. this is  one  of  the reasons  why  the powerful can get away with what they do. so all  media outlets or nearly all are  funded by questionable sources and hey they're patriotic  helping out  the  CIA, the FBI, the local  police and  an oil company
1275 2018-09-04 21:13:18 Only the liberals.

Plus the oil companies.
Plus NASA.
Plus NOAA.
Plus 196 other countries.
Plus me, a Republican.
1276 2018-09-04 21:13:11 Oil is a finite resource. Unless we can envision a day when our oil needs are zero, we can never have too much. That's what I presume his logic is.
1277 2018-09-04 21:13:08 LOL 
Mum: did you check your oil?
Yeah. 
Mum: what colour is it? 
It’s thin and the colour of oil? 
Mum: check your tires? 
Yes. 
Mum: go to the tire shop have them check them
Why? They’re fine! Mum jeez 
Mum: you’re my daughter...
1278 2018-09-04 21:12:54 Same here  - mostly postnasal drip, been using the humidifier with eucalyptus oil every day.
1279 2018-09-04 21:12:48 I’ll be cleaning the pool of oil from my driveway after the first place for quite awhile.
I spent the better part of an hour cleaning the grimy handprints off the interior and exterior of my truck, not to mention the paint scratches all over the hood. It was just an involved mess

1283 2018-09-04 21:12:40 If by TRY you mean act a damn fool...then ya.
1284 2018-09-04 21:12:24 You do realise that we helped the US destroy Iraq over a lie about some WMD's when really all we wanted was control of the largest oil reserves in the middle East. These are the refugees that we helped create.
1285 2018-09-04 21:12:19 I sprayed a full flat out in it that had been lived in by a heavy smoker. It covered most stains but I did have to use a bit of oil based stain block in a couple of areas but considering it’s water based I was impressed with it , also it sticks to glossy surfaces superbly
1286 2018-09-04 21:12:17 We already store month's worth of natural gas, so yes it is possible with hydrogen. Depends on local geology though. Not sure about Australia. But places with lots of oil and gas definitely.

1310 2018-09-04 21:10:04 How about this set of handcrafted wooden Tractor, Wagon, Truck and Hay Bails.  That little guy would play for hours with these pretend items.  They are painted and hand rubbed with not-toxic oil to last for years.

1317 2018-09-04 21:09:24 Yeah, but it’s usually boiling oil.
1318 2018-09-04 21:09:17 Every last protest there today including this was choreographed by @SenSchumer #Schmucklestheclown is working hard to sell snake oil these days!
1319 2018-09-04 21:09:16 Why am I just now discovering beard oil? This shit makes my beard look classy and not borderline homeless
1320 2018-09-04 21:08:51 I need a man to be gentle with me. Rub my tummy, kiss it, oil my scalp, lotion me, make me tea & lock up in my room with me in Sundays.
1321 2018-09-04 21:08:07 Plus you haven't factored in that Alberta is losing 7 B dollars per year because we need to sell our oil at a discount. The pipline will more then pay for itself. Plus jobs etc.

1328 2018-09-04 21:07:28 You will see that chlorination is very cheap, can be done fast and reliable. Make sure the gloves are clean and have no silicone oil or any grease on it. Use a well ventilated area or workshop with exhaust fan. chlorine gas is deadly in high doses.
1329 2018-09-04 21:07:13 Coconut oil doing good by me 
1330 2018-09-04 21:07:06 Of course they anticipated it. @Nike does most of its sales intl. The NRA boycotted United Delta metlife bank of America & their all doin fine. remember #boycottBP (despite the oil spill they are doin great) #boycottstarbucks #boycottpepsi #boycottWalmart resulted in nothing.
1331 2018-09-04 21:07:05 Fish N200, pepper ET al N300, oil dey, light dey no kerosene r gas, 5days soup don ready. Jst buy 12 fufu for N100 in lagere, u go live fine
1332 2018-09-04 21:06:42 They’re so great, we get so much use out of them. Also worth getting a box of seasonings, flour & oil etc.  Safety wise, a carbon monoxide detector. And good luck to your son!
1333 2018-09-04 21:06:34 Disagree strongly, and don’t think images of oil rigs as dollar signs are helpful. We don’t need oil money to do indy, suggesting we do is harmful.
1334 2018-09-04 21:06:22 If the #KinderMorgan #pipeline is in the "national interest", then Alberta & transnational oil interests have hijacked Canada's nat'l interest. Affected communities, threats to the env & certainty that extracting, burning #tarsands oil = game over 4 climate don't matter. #cdnpoli
1335 2018-09-04 21:06:08 Sugar and coconut oil.
1336 2018-09-04 21:05:56 So, big oil & gas & the NRA are trying to buy it for you! I would rather not have my Governor owing any outside groups.

1339 2018-09-04 21:05:45 This is part of why I think we should cut our reliance on oil... If only it wasn't tied up in like, every part of our infrastructure to the point that it'd take an astronomical figure to convert to something else.

1345 2018-09-04 21:04:59 yaaaaaaas, spin on that oil slick!
1346 2018-09-04 21:04:55 @Enterprise i bought a vehicle which was serviced by YOU one month ago and am now experiencing engine failure due to the oil cap falling off and the oil spilling
1347 2018-09-04 21:04:51 I really wouldn't have minded so much if the oil money had been used to benefit the UK population but to sink it all into building up the financial centres in London is such a waste,  only of benefit to the wealthy
1348 2018-09-04 21:04:50 Man whenever I get money I can’t wait to get oil paints I have a feeling I’d be good at it :( I havent found MY medium yet I don’t feel quite comfortable with anything
1349 2018-09-04 21:04:49 Sprays contain alcohol and fragrance oils are created using oils (e.i. coconut oil, almond oils which last longer than sprays that are made with alcohol.

1353 2018-09-04 21:03:55 Let them panick buy and get duped. Thought they learned something in November last year. Some bought cooking oil for $ 8 ikafum yakuita 3.50
1354 2018-09-04 21:03:43 We were performing hydraulic fracturing at UNOCAL in San Joaquin Basin oil fields in the early 90s, maybe before. Seemed pretty routine then.

1357 2018-09-04 21:03:17 I just spilled over half of my bottle of tea tree oil all over my bathroom sink no one talk to me for the rest of the day I'm PISSED.
1358 2018-09-04 21:03:11 there's so much to this. it looks like certain TYT funders sure loved an oil company.... 2 yrs ago Cenk joked that the Native  Americans protesting are too much like  hippies & Ana laughed too. He said  they should go tot the courts more  than protest  & that we need  pipelines!
1359 2018-09-04 21:03:10 Not that alone,didn’t the FM expressed her willingness to engage PM to iron out devolution matters.Let alone the  document #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope ,they still ignored it .It is time to oil the engines of #Indyref2 #Scotref
1360 2018-09-04 21:02:56 Utterly bizarre that he thinks Kavanaugh recognized the name rather than withdrawing from someone who effectively introduced himself as a crazy person.
1361 2018-09-04 21:02:47 A plan executed
1362 2018-09-04 21:02:39 If I had a man he would’ve gotten onto me by now for not getting my oil changed
1363 2018-09-04 21:02:39 Ha! No! Your not. I do it. And if you use a real cellulose sponge and dish soap squirted on the sponge- it does a great job! So does olive oil. Lasts longer than the spray.

1367 2018-09-04 21:02:04 Having watched the video from several angles and read his account of what happened I can honestly say this man suffers from only seeing things as he wishes they were. He is to be pitied for his circumstances but instead MSNBC is going to use him for propaganda..
1368 2018-09-04 21:02:00 well i have got all our vintage items out, old ipads, all sorts. I shall not be defeated.

1371 2018-09-04 21:01:46 If you’re not pessimistic you haven’t been paying attention. Nihilism isn’t denial. It’s acceptance.

1372 2018-09-04 21:01:21 It's coming, Mueller is crossing all his T's, and dotting all his I's, but he's about to drop the hammer on this snake oil salesman.
1373 2018-09-04 21:01:21 So does this include any product made from oil or just gas powered engines.
1374 2018-09-04 21:01:14 That just adds oil to the fire

1378 2018-09-04 21:00:44 I watched the video. Much ado about nothing which is apropo cause you got nothing on him. Welcome Justice Kavanaugh
1379 2018-09-04 21:00:34 I don’t get how ANY POC can possibly be supportive of this badministration w/its extremely overt racism & bigotry. The whole thing goes into my head, jumps around like drops of water in a skillet filled w/hot oil.....then turns to fog & falls out of my head.

1389 2018-09-04 20:59:37 Resources funds i mean are limited in african states thats why a need to find ways to earn from our resources minerals produce and oil somalai cant even extract oil so its not uncommon so stop pointing fingers

1396 2018-09-04 20:58:43 Trying to look at the bright side... I had been putting off getting the oil changed in my car. Since I totalled it, now I don't have to.
1397 2018-09-04 20:58:39 No, going after a man who had an agenda to discredit the Judge.  If he hates him that much, why did he want to shake hands with him?  Seems to me he was using his daughter’s death to further his own agenda. Go read his tweets, it is obvious.
1398 2018-09-04 20:58:33 Venting on a nominee is not "fighting for change"- it's merely a premeditated and pointless political stunt.
1399 2018-09-04 20:58:33 Sounds like the only option if you want a deep dive. Real Journalists used to do this before they became threatened with extinction.
1400 2018-09-04 20:58:32 Roast beef is the absolute pinnacle of sandwiches, but IMO best without cheese, which only distracts from the delicious meat flavor. Mayo, oil, and extra vinegar please.
1401 2018-09-04 20:58:23 So above all Guttenberg should have a high regard for safety. A meeting with crazed hysterics and protestors removed. Months of disgusting and vile posts and threats. A meeting which his daughters could no longer stay. And the man approached from behind expecting warm reaction?
1402 2018-09-04 20:58:06 Lies. America made up a war to steal oil, thus Tillman wasn’t fighting to defend anything or anybody but the United States of Thieves.
1403 2018-09-04 20:57:58 They have no drinking water and no electricity. (No Thing) This city is rich in (oil )and the government does not give them their rights 
1404 2018-09-04 20:57:49 This is gonna sound crazy BUT peppermint essential oil!! Rub some on your wrists and forehead then put some under your nose! It helps me! Also, Excedrin migraine helps.
1405 2018-09-04 20:57:46 Of course revenues are down right now during a major transition. Plus you have not factored in the doubling of the pipelines capacity more the loss of income for Canada when it can't get its oil to market.
1406 2018-09-04 20:57:40 Getting an oil change at my small-town quick lube. Old fart in a pickup pulls up. Asks how long it'll be.

"20 minutes" says they.

"I'm gon' to go get me some chicken fingers then. They're not gon' eat themselves y'know, they get lonely over there" says he.

1408 2018-09-04 20:57:33 Gaddafi was assassinated cause he was liberating his ppl and wanted to change some things with how the oil is sold.

Go watch Hillary Clinton talking about Libya  Evil pure Evil
1409 2018-09-04 20:57:13 In 1995, @arkrestaurants CEO Michael Weinstien commissioned legendary artist @huntslonem for "The Bryant Park Series" The magnificent oil on canvas has hung in the restaurant since the day we opened!
1410 2018-09-04 20:57:10 I too am sad you didn't get to experience this
1411 2018-09-04 20:57:06 maybe instead of throwing tantrums like a spoiled brat, #Alberta should build refineries and refine the oil there instead of forcing pipelines on the rest of #Canada. Then there won't be any need for trains carrying toxic bitumen.#bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet
1412 2018-09-04 20:57:02 I mean that's only with conditioner,you've got moisturizer,texturizer,relaxer,breakage stuff,gloss stuff,olive oil (Popeye comes to mind.)coconut oil,argan oil,castor oil,butter crème,detangling milk (like why, milk?)coconut water (like I drink that.)algae renew,almond jai?!?
1413 2018-09-04 20:56:52 I just bought a cool new record The media lies! They’re all just a bunch of fruitless pies! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1414 2018-09-04 20:56:36 You’re over seeing a genocide in Yemen. Let’s face it- this isn’t about Assad- this is about Big Oil and you’re just the next puppet in the long line of deep state puppets attacking the Middle East for Big Oil.
1415 2018-09-04 20:56:29 Security jumped in but way to spin the narrative
1416 2018-09-04 20:56:10 Lmao  you honestly think if Zim had oil we would be having this discussion. Don't Campare Zim to Egypt and Rwanda in terms of resources. You have nothing to offer and yet you are bending rules when it comes to human rights.
1417 2018-09-04 20:55:41 Haven’t the graham crackers spread enough snake oil bigotry? Try to more like a true Christian like Jimmy Carter, not KKK.
1418 2018-09-04 20:55:40 I feel so stupid when I get my oil changed
1419 2018-09-04 20:55:40 - hasn't bounced back even though the price of oil has. When the Saudis tanked the price of oil the Venezuelan goverment went into damage control mode and began micromanaging the national oil industry through increased bureaucracy. -
1420 2018-09-04 20:55:37 The lamps must not only have some oil, but the watching virgins must have their vessels containing a supply of oil to insure the lamps being kept burning to the end.
1421 2018-09-04 20:55:37 Thank you so much!! I saw an oil slick over the weekend and was like oooo I can do that on my eyes !!
1422 2018-09-04 20:55:35 I AM A BRITISH PHARMACIST FOR THE 48 YEARS. I DONOT BELIEVE THAT PAKISTANI HOSPITALS HAVE THE FACILITIES TO ANALYSE OLIVE OIL AND HONEY.THE RESULTS OF TESTS R FAKE. AND OF GREAT SHAME.THE CULPRITS SHOULD BE PROSECUTED #CJ SC PAKISTAN
1423 2018-09-04 20:55:30 look how angry you got that someone told you that palm oil is bad, you love it and support it.
1424 2018-09-04 20:55:24 Let’s oil it Fridays when im not poor 
1425 2018-09-04 20:55:02 All in two seconds wow.
1426 2018-09-04 20:55:01 Oil, oil and more oil. And the highest quality you can get.
1427 2018-09-04 20:54:57 A generous amount of salt and Lashings of olive extra virgin oil. Enjoy
1428 2018-09-04 20:54:52 Poppin shit like vegetable oil
1429 2018-09-04 20:54:50 That is why I would go to the dealership. A lot of young people buy luxury cars and dog them. And they will look nice, but Josh found one with the oil that was black as tar and thick as molasses, which damages the engine and sensors.

1431 2018-09-04 20:54:41 We earned USD 381.9 Billion between 2010-2014 in Oil revenue, but @GEJonathan failed to provide proportional developmental projects in the country. Today the likes of @benmurraybruce et al have the mouth to condemn this Govt.!

1433 2018-09-04 20:54:17 Sounds like this guy has his plan set. Wouldn’t trust him at all. Lots of loony lefties there
1434 2018-09-04 20:53:57 the whole time kyatt and i loaded her dad's trailer with wood earlier, she talked in an over exaggerated country accent while also asking "IS THIS WHAT ITS LIKE IN THE OIL FIELDS"
1435 2018-09-04 20:53:29 Oil 
- prized less in the absence of conflict of talk of it
- priceless once panic sets in.

1437 2018-09-04 20:53:14 After the prolonged trial of the tarrying of the bridegroom and after the slumber and the sleep, the wise virgins alone were found with the oil which had kept their lamps burning to the end.
1438 2018-09-04 20:52:20 I just found FOUR bottles of tanning oil in my room...why can’t I be normal and finish one bottle of something before buying a new one?
1439 2018-09-04 20:52:15 Does Total still win oil from Iran?
1440 2018-09-04 20:52:13 Maybe the pretty girl was picking something on her arm and trying not to get noticed. This is so ridiculous. I still thought it meant ok.
1441 2018-09-04 20:52:02 We always pull for him. Amalie Oil used to be one of our sponsers also.(Gunite Express)
1442 2018-09-04 20:51:31 Trading oil with the u. S. Is our best bet, especially if you're concerned about environmentalism.  

Do you really think that shipping oil over the ocean on ships is safer for the environment than pipelines between Canada and the US?
1443 2018-09-04 20:51:22 Promises promises again Hertz sucks, I was told in a DM that upper management would call.  Crickets lol. Whole story again, told at noon car was ready, we got their at 3.30, then we was told the oil needed changed, left came back, we call 10 times with no answer to see if ready.
1444 2018-09-04 20:51:15 I wonder if he's gonna show up here in oil covered coveralls to pretend he's here to fight for the "middle class" and to get TMX built.
1445 2018-09-04 20:51:13 Well he sure isn’t going to change the oil being shipped into Canada.    The ships are owned by past liberal s.   ( Paul Martin )
1446 2018-09-04 20:51:01 Where is your compassion for the unborn?
1447 2018-09-04 20:50:59 Under no circumstances will I be “rubbing in” my dry oil fake tan. I don’t care what the instructions say, I purchased this product because I am both lazy and unskilled
1448 2018-09-04 20:50:43 I am truly sorry for his loss. I think his vitriol is misplaced and he is being used by those who have a different agenda. No satisfying outcome for him, I'm afraid.
1449 2018-09-04 20:50:41 Remember when people looked at me stupid for wanting to go straight to the oil field after i dropped out.. now some of those people ask me for a job. Sorry sir I have no pull 
1450 2018-09-04 20:50:26 Saudi: "Can I not do the human rights?"
World: "Fuck no!"
Saudi: "But I have oil. It'd be bad if I stop oil"
World: "Fuck.... you know what? do whatever the hell you want"
1451 2018-09-04 20:50:19 Ironic that the people most opposed to the pipeline are the ones that take the most government handouts!
Oil revenue is the quickest way for Canadians to find new technologies and to get off our oil dependance.
1452 2018-09-04 20:50:16 Bloody palm oil. So hard to avoid it.
1453 2018-09-04 20:50:15 Looking forward to it. All the speculation, be nice to see the numbers.
1454 2018-09-04 20:50:12 He had no idea who he was. Gallery was full of kooks out to disrupt. They had to remove his children
1455 2018-09-04 20:50:10 325 million "regular people" in this country. I'd prefer they not all have their voices heard during a process constitutionally tailored around mere Senate consent, that has over the years morphed into a "___ is literally Hitler" slanderfest. There's ALREADY too much idiocy.
1456 2018-09-04 20:49:41 And finally (I know bare tweets). Might be worthwhile sending an email to Professor Bassam Fattouh (Finance and Management @SOAS ). His research mainly focuses on the  Oil industry in the GCC, but I am sure he can direct you to the right places. #derien #vavavoom
1457 2018-09-04 20:49:34 since forever he's been selling snake oil books like "Devouring Hermes: The Business of the Self" and it's a huge tell on anyone who is legitimately down with him
1458 2018-09-04 20:49:34 She's no oil painting I'll give her that,
1459 2018-09-04 20:49:24 Would you ever consider mining for something else other than gold? Opals, diamonds, silver..maybe even oil?
btw, love the show, big fan from Denmark 
1460 2018-09-04 20:49:14 Presume that the folk that still believe in opinion polls, are the same ones that buy from the snake oil vendors!:)
1461 2018-09-04 20:49:11 Yeah I can't see that happening. If he did he'd probably tell them their racist or intolerant for questioning him on 'Why he is killing jobs & our oil & gas industry.

1463 2018-09-04 20:49:09 I think someone on here said tea tree oil evaporates? I need to know if it's true because my bottle is empty 
1464 2018-09-04 20:48:57 I just bought sum vitamin e oil, let’s see how this goes
1465 2018-09-04 20:48:44 I'm pretty blind without my glasses, everything looks like an oil painting. I think I would be scared to look at people without them on 
1466 2018-09-04 20:48:37 Kindasleezy Rice, with her name on an oil tanker and the one who couldn't imagine al queda using planes as bombs? That's what stanford produces? Garbage.
1467 2018-09-04 20:48:29 Looking out for a Hornby oil tanker so I can make this on a smaller scale when my SethDav faces arrive
1468 2018-09-04 20:48:26 Call me hun again ya essential oil ass sellin bitch
1469 2018-09-04 20:48:25 I'm not dankula but I can somewhat answer your question. Socialist economies are effectively economies run by massive bureaucracies. Bureaucracies are inherently inefficient and the larger the bureaucracy the more inefficient it becomes. This is why Venezuelan oil production-

1474 2018-09-04 20:47:38 Did they ever do something in this game with the apple, except the "apple" is a ball of energy that is created when the planet's oil supply is eaten by some kind of living computer virus?
1475 2018-09-04 20:47:26 Since raccoons haven't been back to finish the seeds, they must have been put off by the peppermint spray and clove essential oil diffuser.
1476 2018-09-04 20:47:17 Water and oil do mix using emulsifying agent ok?
1477 2018-09-04 20:47:15 New map location teased, Ploiești oil fields? ;-)
1478 2018-09-04 20:47:14 So you are saying that this is a hoax that thousands of climate scientists, the big oil companies (who now admit AGW), NASA, NOAA and 193 other countries are all in on? Gotcha? Read the National Climate Assessment.

1482 2018-09-04 20:46:45 Coconut oil does acutely impair artery function just like other sources of saturated fat.

Is literature not an artform because it's just words on paper? Or paintings because it's just colored oil or whathaveyou on a canvas? You may be ready to type a quick response explaining why not, but know that's exactly how I view that particular argument you made
1485 2018-09-04 20:46:08 Nothing I heard from Republican statements would have required removing his family from hearings. Dems? Now lecture me again on civility.
1486 2018-09-04 20:46:06 It was cash and stock. My defense: their core business is oil. They are not in any way on a path to shrinks their oil business. Putting PVs on gas stations is greenwashing. It still is a place to sell oil.
1487 2018-09-04 20:46:03 Here’s a suggestion: A special feature on endangered, SARA-listed, Southern Resident Killer Whales, and how a #TransMountain tanker oil spill in their Salish Sea critical habitat could wipe them out overnight.

1490 2018-09-04 20:45:30 Does he get it that climate change is real,  unlike Ford who removed this mention?  We are already among top 10 polluters? But my bad hes the guy who called tar oil the cleanest
1491 2018-09-04 20:45:29 Why have I been here for an hour waiting on an oil change when I had an appt like Valvoline is hella expensive but they get that shit done in 8 minutes flat
1492 2018-09-04 20:45:28 I got my oil changed today (it apparently needed to be done badly)& I am not taking it back to the lot I got it from for a check for a few more days bc I think I just desperately needed it to get done. Plus at the jiffy lube they did an inspection & didn’t find nothing so

1496 2018-09-04 20:44:44 Don't they have better things to worry about like gutter oil
1497 2018-09-04 20:44:36 I appreciate that oil from Alberta is important to the national economy, but it comes with significant burdens which require consideration. We seem to be rapidly reaching the point where the costs outweigh the benefit.

1502 2018-09-04 20:44:04 Omg this guy is delusional 
1503 2018-09-04 20:43:54 Don’t book tickets......this is snake oil selling at it finest
1504 2018-09-04 20:43:50 But you'd just complain about jobs if the SNP shunned oil wouldn't you. Practically we're going to need oil for the foreseeable future but we should be weaning ourselves of burning dinosaurs sooner rather than later. Rome etc etc.
1505 2018-09-04 20:43:41 How that CBD oil treat y’all? 
1506 2018-09-04 20:43:36 Look, I lived in Latin America. I witnessed land theft there on numerous occasions. One example: with the Afro-Colombians in the state of Choco. The land was theirs and once US corporations found oil and coal, they had their land stolen from them.
1507 2018-09-04 20:43:07 Your wrong on crinkle cut - there’s more surface area on the outside, there for more contact to hot oil therefore better than all other options
1508 2018-09-04 20:43:05 This is funny. Malhotra cites the Lyon heart study as the most successful in his editorial. Main intervention in Lyon? Butter was replaced with a canola oil margarine.
1509 2018-09-04 20:42:44 Josh Bell looks like he’s thinking about buying some oil and a cast iron skillet.
1510 2018-09-04 20:42:40 In Greece we fry with olive oil, obviously.
1511 2018-09-04 20:42:38 Well, modern advocacy, anyway.
1512 2018-09-04 20:42:25 Millions of iraqis died during and after the war,all those lose of inoccent lifes on you. Evidences were manipulated to invade an oil rich country.Millions dead so wht “it was just a mistake”
1513 2018-09-04 20:42:24 Someone want to tell @chucktodd they this is why the media has a trust and credibility problem, not Fox News?
1514 2018-09-04 20:42:11 Meanwhile, the entire school board, police department, and government of  Broward County has been caught lying, obfuscating responses to legitimate questions, and shunning any responsibility.
1515 2018-09-04 20:42:08 Once again the libs step on a rake. @Tommyxtopher @rmayemsinger @lauriedtmann @sophiabush @4lisaguerro @senkamalaharris @warrenleightTV
1516 2018-09-04 20:41:55 Yes actually she does.  The Koch brothers campaign donations so that she can continue their pro oil and gas and anti public transportation policies.
1517 2018-09-04 20:41:54 But heard the oil is high in cholesterol
1518 2018-09-04 20:41:53 Maybe they should have added some oil!
1519 2018-09-04 20:41:35 so what happens if the price of oil crashes to below $40? Or China decides to stop doling out the cash? Or both?

This is not a sustainable model.
1520 2018-09-04 20:41:25 Obama kneecapped American oil development at every turn. Remember the moratorium he put on drilling after all the experts said not to? Many rigs left the country.
1521 2018-09-04 20:41:20 How old is Nigeria? And how much does Nigeria generate from Crude oil sells that since its independence it cannot produce what it consumes? I think you're ONE of the problems that Nigeria has

1526 2018-09-04 20:40:51 The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 is an example Bitzer's Perspective in which the disaster created a situation that needed rhetoric for it to be resolved by organizations. The oil spill can essentially be viewed as an exigence. @AValiavska #OrgAd4 #COMM3460

1548 2018-09-04 20:39:07 Which is peanuts for a company that last year spent 7.5 billion to buy an other oil company.
1549 2018-09-04 20:38:48 Never over doing mct oil again..
1550 2018-09-04 20:38:43 No, we got real American oil. Something the Democrats refused to allow us to produce. Maybe if the Democrats weren't out to destroy the country, we could have a nicer guy in office.

1559 2018-09-04 20:36:54 This statement is incorrect. Suncor was ready to upgrade their refinery to accept dilbit and Energy East included the Cromer lateral which was specifically included to supply Irving with light oil from Saskatchewan's half of the Bakken play.
1560 2018-09-04 20:36:49 I guess that's what the market thinking but in the end lost production is the only medium term effect so a bit baffled.  Libya not getting any bid going what so ever. Iraq also having trouble in Basra again although to me a long long ways from armed confrontation at the oil port.

1573 2018-09-04 20:35:51 Lol indeed. Olive oil (before showering) is the single most useful thing I've tried, but unless you're willing to go out with oil-saturated hair, it can't totally prevent frizz.
1574 2018-09-04 20:35:42 It was better than what I thought. When I first tasted it out of the container it reminded me of eggplant to I added seasoned salt, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, ginger, olive oil, green onions and soy sauce.

1672 2018-09-04 20:23:56 Olive oil has a low smoke point too so it burns easily. Butter tastes better, but a little olive oil for slightly sauteed bell pepper over low heat is delicious.
1673 2018-09-04 20:23:30 Lol snake oil?
1674 2018-09-04 20:23:25 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.

1676 2018-09-04 20:23:03 Why too much oil on that face ?

1680 2018-09-04 20:22:41 The current administration requires new nominees to believe women are a form of livestock and high treason is, at worst, a 3-point traffic violation.  Also, you must support an initiative for voter ID wherein identity is verified by showing a valid, family-owned oil derrick.
1681 2018-09-04 20:22:28 I think the video you're referring to was one Stephen Herrero showed us at an oil company where he felt it was definetly a predatory move.  Showed the bear following the guy through the bush too.  Stephen did a play by play analysis of the bear's moves.
1682 2018-09-04 20:22:09 A while ago I realized that linalool, the main component of lavender oil, is a tertiary alcohol. However, it isn't saturated, and I suspect this will make trouble with sodium metal. Wouldn't it be possible to add hydrogen with a catalyst (nickel?) and use the tetrahydrolinalool?
1683 2018-09-04 20:21:44 If you cook your kale in coconut oil, it's really easy to scrape straight into the bin before ordering take out.

It will be here for another 100 years.
It may as well be Canadian oil.

How high will oil prices go with the storm coming
1691 2018-09-04 20:20:35 So it's official. I have mild eczema on both sides of my neck. Joy.
I bought coconut oil & milk mix lotion & raw shea butter to alleviate the itchy burn. Most expensive lotions I've bought. The bottles are pretty big so I won't have to buy them for a LONG time.
1692 2018-09-04 20:20:28 @AHS_Warranty My real estate agent told me that warranty companies take out obsolete equipment such as an oil furnace that was replaced by heat pumps long before I bought the house. I specifically asked about this when I got a quote from AHS for a home warranty.  1/

1713 2018-09-04 20:18:15 That, we can agree on. But it shouldn't give big oil or coal a free pass. Big companies have to get with the times and limit their CO2 emissions.
1714 2018-09-04 20:17:59 yes tbh I prefer the simpler ones anyway, my fave is olive oil, loads of garlic and some chili flakes! you wouldn't really want smth rich like carbonara too often so that works out. and ooh yeah pasta salad is a good idea too! thank you;;
1715 2018-09-04 20:17:53 Time for Congress and the Senate to learn the complete truth about NAFTA. @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr "After you take out oil products from Canada’s exports to the U.S., the U.S. runs a massive trade surplus plus against Canada," to the tune of $49 billion in 2016".
1716 2018-09-04 20:17:42 I was getting an oil change today and this woman was so offended that people had tattoos.

1718 2018-09-04 20:17:37 The NEW liposomal CBD
Now this is totally different to our regular oils. I have used this a few times when needed but not using regular.
The oil is thick and has a very sweet taste, I can't decide if I like it or not yet 
This definitely needs a very good shake before each use

1722 2018-09-04 20:17:20 Very true... We can easily solve this issue of #FuelPriceHike if we work on the Oil refinery and process the oil from #Turkwell...
1723 2018-09-04 20:17:11 Ask her what her grandma used to cook with! I am pretty sure they only started using olive oil after the 60s and low fat hysteria. All our grandmas were terrorized by doctors & corn oil salesmen into hiding their animal fat past & started pretending to like plant oils instead.

1727 2018-09-04 20:16:42 Well to be fair the failures are due to the western banking system. Russia is trying to compete and Chiba is attempting to displace the dollar as the worlds reserve currency and primary oil purchase method. China is even moving to a gold backed Yuan.

1729 2018-09-04 20:16:37 I don't think that the American people have connected the dots on this. It's not just wind generation either. Upstate NY's power grid has been sold to foreign owned companies. That means you are buying foreign energy just a sure as if you were buying oil from Saudi Arabia.

1732 2018-09-04 20:15:57 I know several people that own companies and are heavily involved with Drones/robotics in oil and gas. Would be happy to connect you.
1733 2018-09-04 20:15:52 i’m pretty sure biological waste has more to do with cultivation of disease than plastic though they are both fundamental causes of pollution. i’d see your point if you said something about oil spills or other garbage we blatantly dump into water supplies lollll

Oh Shiiiit, i forget that America is supporting the Saudia Arabia to killing the people there for get the money and oil and buying the guns
1747 2018-09-04 20:13:44 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest. Congress won't tell you this.
1748 2018-09-04 20:13:40 I literally said palm oil is unethical and many vegans choose not to eat it because of the damage the industry causes. What are you talking about
1749 2018-09-04 20:13:37 I will do some experiments and see what it takes to polish those. I rubbed them down with mineral oil just to clean them after cutting. Steel wool might be the way to go. The resin gums up sandpaper like crazy.
1750 2018-09-04 20:13:37 I was sad that there wasn’t any olive oil there but it’s still beautiful

1779 2018-09-04 20:11:05 I'm going to go ahead and break it to you: olive oil is for dressing, not cooking. The idea that Mediterraneans cook with it came from American academics studying peasants impoverished after WW2. Meds cook in tallow and ghee whenever they can!
1780 2018-09-04 20:11:03 When I was cooking with my friend in food tech, someone smothered our burger in oil, and it caught on fire inside the oven. My friend took it out and I put out the fire.

1785 2018-09-04 20:10:13 Yes. It’s subsidies to the oil industry that have kept them afloat, the use of eminent domain, soft pollution penalties. With investment in social and natural capital (biodiversity) rather than built capital and consumer goods, the growth function can be used to grow nature.

1808 2018-09-04 20:07:37 There was short period of c. 20 years out of 300 years when oil revenues paid more than the Barnett formula brought back. My figures are more typical.

1813 2018-09-04 20:07:07 @beyoncepadthai8 sry I stole coconut oil and chapstick out of your purse
1814 2018-09-04 20:07:05 I think this is all easier to understand if you appreciate that Justin wants to leave the oil in the ground.
1815 2018-09-04 20:06:47 Nestle stop chopping down rainforest for Palm Oil
1816 2018-09-04 20:06:40 @JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan Hopefully transit in BC wlll be fueled by Alta oil @RachelNotley which they have to sell
1817 2018-09-04 20:06:39 Yes McConells stunt worked. But it’s not the Constitution that put him there. Who are you quoting?
1818 2018-09-04 20:06:36 Disregarding petroleum as a fuel source for transportation and energy production, most people forget or do not realize how much stuff is made from oil/oil is involved in production: paint, rubber, plastics, medicine, etc. After peak oil these secondary products will be the issue

1820 2018-09-04 20:06:28 The ASALs have enormous untapped resources in areas such as livestock, energy generation, tourism, agriculture, mining, oil & gas, among others. These can be harnessed to sustain communities and contribute to overall national development.#ASALsconference2018 @Devolution254
1821 2018-09-04 20:06:16 We must stop mining our Planet and mine the asteroid belt and move towards energy production based on a primary force, i.e., gauge Boson - solar, rather than inefficient & polluting chemical thermal conversion, e,g., coal, oil, gas etc!
1822 2018-09-04 20:05:50 I won’t be surprised,lol. With all the oil and sweetness.

1824 2018-09-04 20:05:25 Robert you need not worry. I just had Honey with Olive Oil. All iz well. You just sleep tight.
1825 2018-09-04 20:05:06 They make great gun oil too especially on my “evil” AR-15’s.
1826 2018-09-04 20:05:03 You can disagree without attempting to say its clueless and incoherent. But then that would require you have a valid argument.
1827 2018-09-04 20:04:58 So In Need Of A Full Body Coconut Oil Massage!!! 
1828 2018-09-04 20:04:43 To this day, it remains my favorite beard oil and beard balm scent. Amazing!
1829 2018-09-04 20:04:40 input of oil was the game changer of warfare, over the last century has shown that conflict was not diminished, but boosted   by the prosperity and technology created by oil
1830 2018-09-04 20:04:35 The reason your speech is being taken away is because if it isn't, they will stop providing us oil, call it what you like, but to me that's just backdoor blasphemy law, they claim to dislike hate, but provide the weapons that create it, it's very obvious and has been for a while.
1831 2018-09-04 20:04:29 Debts!!!
1832 2018-09-04 20:04:23 couldve been like “omg mum that’s essential oil !! x”
1833 2018-09-04 20:04:22 $230 for an oil change 
1834 2018-09-04 20:04:09 find out where you stay and act like we found some oil nigga.
1835 2018-09-04 20:04:08 Maybe I’m overthinking it but when I read about oil restrictions I’m thinking Geopolitical leverage and Iran isn’t urgent. Nothing puts a smile on Putin’s face like cash and them filling an oil supply void is the same thing.
1836 2018-09-04 20:04:05 Nice try
1837 2018-09-04 20:03:50 Sorry but most of us are blind and deaf after being fed on mercury laden sugar ,plastic rice adulterated fuel ,cooking oil and any other food imported by politicians and their associates so how do you expect us to see.
1838 2018-09-04 20:03:46 Jesus converted water into wine. #SharjeelMemon converted vodka into olive oil. This is the most useless miracle ever. No one will invite him to their party!!
1839 2018-09-04 20:03:39 may it work for my super oil producing eyelids
1840 2018-09-04 20:03:35 Petroleum-based. Sound familiar? Petroleum equals oil industry, they have everybody in their pocket, all of the corporations from Automotive to toys, in some way or another. This is a paradigm shift and oil is going to fight it all the way!
1841 2018-09-04 20:03:33 They’re discussing it again... but I understand that it won’t be developed in the near future...
( unlike oil).
1842 2018-09-04 20:03:15 I love the way Egyptian Musk oil smells. It’s my favorite.
1843 2018-09-04 20:03:05 Someone take my car to get the oil changed pls.
1844 2018-09-04 20:02:43 @atiku you are going no where, restructuring isn't just a mere statement a lot is involve a lot of State can't even pay salary without govt funds then you still want new state recreation. What other source of revenue do we have outside the oil. Please allow the country to focus
1845 2018-09-04 20:02:39 back when STP... meant motor oil.

*those were the days 
1846 2018-09-04 20:02:37 When you put coconut oil in your hair and then rub the excess on your knees & elbows. @IfyNwadiwe knows what I’m talkin bout 
1847 2018-09-04 20:02:24 Prof pointed out your silence on corruption and you just fell into the same trap. Prof pointed out specific assets in states such as port, oil resources but you hang on generic points
1848 2018-09-04 20:02:17 I don’t remember how to change the oil lol but it was nice of him to teach me
1849 2018-09-04 20:02:15 Turmeric essential oil... also consider
1850 2018-09-04 20:01:44 I suspect he made an agreement with two e other countries to create a good back currency and force other countries to buy oil with gold.
1851 2018-09-04 20:01:41 Respect is earned not just given. Just like a living.
1852 2018-09-04 20:01:37 Your drill bit could be dull, some 3-1 Oil on your tip might make your cut cleaner, and you might try striking your target area with a hammer & punch to give the bit a divot to sit in.
1853 2018-09-04 20:01:23 And yeah, some the Y2K stuff was legitimate snake oil selling but a good chunk of it was just incredibly important panic patching.  :-P
1854 2018-09-04 20:01:11 Fuck trump, the world is not only the West. Long live the rightnesseus. They are in Syria for the oil and only the oil. The started now also in Somalie

1862 2018-09-04 19:59:36 Can someone take my car for an oil change. I hate going

1874 2018-09-04 19:58:22 Is it class divide or is Will trying to compensate for the lack of a female parent by going for the girly option?

A: "Money"
1883 2018-09-04 19:57:11 I don’t enjoy paying $40 for an oil change and tire rotation when it can be cheaper but I also don’t want my car to get messed up so I’ll just keep coming here.. lol

I hope you are fine, and my letter reaches you sans too much tardiness. I write to keep you up to date on the progression of my studies, and I have many long nights of burning the midnight oil concluded that Flutteryshy is still excrement.
Sincerely
CaffComm."
1886 2018-09-04 19:56:55 Aye that’s my wife u talking about ima propose with a gold ring with a oil in the middle.
1887 2018-09-04 19:56:29 Ego over you for there. Demma rent be mad. The oil people capture there
1888 2018-09-04 19:56:20 But I don't eat meat, and they have a good veggie delight sub when you get all the good veggies and oil on it!

1890 2018-09-04 19:56:03 @UdosChoiceUK what time do you recommend to take udo's oil to be most beneficial? Or is it down to personal preference?
1891 2018-09-04 19:55:54 I just came across a website that calls oil for church candles "liturgical fuel" and I can't stop giggling about it.
1892 2018-09-04 19:55:42 What happened to changamwe oil refinery?
1893 2018-09-04 19:55:40 Nah Italians like me have olive oil and red wine for blood. You gotta have that to be Italian.
1894 2018-09-04 19:55:24 Stop killing baby's to make baby oil.
1895 2018-09-04 19:55:22 Where are republicans going to go find a judge .??????What groups do You All go to ?.....OMG this is a snake oil sale man on frack ,He is the BEST choice ..Calls it a HOME RUN ! .. Roe Wade  Clinton hes talkin about
1896 2018-09-04 19:55:07 Try cod liver oil
1897 2018-09-04 19:55:04 By saying this, which is his legitimate opinion, he is impugning #BrettKavanaugh's integrity.  I really don't blame Kavanaugh.  I do, however, have sympathy for Mr. Guttenberg and his terrible loss.
1898 2018-09-04 19:55:00 Some more of their "truth and facts" is all. Nothing to see here.
1899 2018-09-04 19:54:56 Seriously you’re going after a man whose daughter was murdered six months ago? Repugnant.
1900 2018-09-04 19:54:40 After this self righteous and ignorant proclamation you had better not be using any oil or oil byproducts. Not one.
1901 2018-09-04 19:54:34 Ameen. Thank You!!!
1902 2018-09-04 19:54:32 (part 1) Hello Mr. Den bekymrade polisen, I am the son of Nigerian prince, we have 30 million U.S. dollars which we got from a couple of inflated oil contracts from crude oil contract awarded to foreign contractors in NNPC.
1903 2018-09-04 19:54:31 Honestly, fuck the states. I want to live in France. I'm on the coast and it doesn't smell like fish, salt, or oil. #paradise
1904 2018-09-04 19:54:29 Using an oil propaganda site seriously?
1905 2018-09-04 19:54:28 Aquarius.SilkoilofMorocco' the best hair products I've used, 
Argan oil infused, message me if you're interested also sell cosmetics & skincare all infused with argan oil, all natural ingredients vegan friendly, & kind to critters
1906 2018-09-04 19:54:22 @dr_organic Hi, I just bought the 'Dr Organic Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Treatment Serum', how many pumps should I use for medium length, fine/dry hair? This is not specified on the packaging. :)
1907 2018-09-04 19:54:19 Even if you disagree with kavenaughs standards and beliefs...how is this ok?? how is this opening up for a dialogue to discuss the issues...the squeaky wheel doesn't get the oil all the time..sometimes it gets removed and replaced
1908 2018-09-04 19:54:17 I'd suggest the difference contains the answer. Inflation expectations play a large role in price levels. My theory is the inc. in M2+ degraded price signals. Hence the US oil patch and Tesla appear able to deliver profits. Bitcoin is also interesting re: inflation expectations.
1909 2018-09-04 19:54:16 thanks. u can also get it in phospholipid form in krill oil.
1910 2018-09-04 19:54:08 Oh dear Lindsey Snake Oil Graham is gunna charm us... ya’ll

I’mma need a beard oil in like December so just save one for me
1912 2018-09-04 19:53:54 and they both burn oil! 

Thanks brittan
1913 2018-09-04 19:53:50 I've got a feeling they've sent Farage to try and mend bridges with Brexit looking likely.  But some of us have very long memories AND a far amount of Scot blood in our veins. We'll buy Scottish products everyday all day, but not what that snake oil trader is offering.
1914 2018-09-04 19:53:49 Haha, they're called fat bombs. These ones taste like a peanut butter cup. Coconut oil, peanut butter, cocoa powder, and some vanilla extract.
1915 2018-09-04 19:53:44 Especially after your own kids have to be escorted out by security? Absolutely fucking not.
1916 2018-09-04 19:53:36 Sir, this is a Wendy’s.
1917 2018-09-04 19:53:33 I can't disagree with that although some of it is about denying others from selling their oil , so others can sell more . The other aspect of these wars is actually to Destroy countries , civilizations.
1918 2018-09-04 19:53:24 Kamela Harris personifies what is wrong with the decaying, dying, and scum laden state of California.  @dnc @cnn @TheView
1919 2018-09-04 19:53:19 Kaepernick didn't sacrifice anything. He was frantically trying to become a Joe Namath type of character to avoid becoming a has been, and played a political game.

He's not poor, he's never put his life on the line for anything, he just grandstanded.
1920 2018-09-04 19:53:18 Thank you, I owe it to your beard oil, balm, shampoo, and softener. Whenever you need another Spokesbeard (Spokesman) hit me up. 1

1925 2018-09-04 19:52:47 Loved racing there!! 
1926 2018-09-04 19:52:41 When will #Qanon mention the fact Aramco sells 10 million+ barrels of oil a day with western government backing to obtain it or is that not part of the plan? The plan to make them a super state before 2025 then? Cause it seems like it, none of these people will call it out. None!
1927 2018-09-04 19:52:39 After oil prices dropped and the reserves had been looted.
1928 2018-09-04 19:52:28 Balata West North fault block

1930 2018-09-04 19:52:26 2 stroke racing oil literally would turn a man on
1931 2018-09-04 19:52:04 That backfired badly, and when he didn't get the contract offer he felt he was worth, he walked away. He then tried to make not getting a new contract with a different team about racism and his stand, when it was about baggage and his lack of ability.
1932 2018-09-04 19:52:02 Wow! Dumb post! I just drove over a freshly paved section of road! Schools, hospitals etc being built! Where do you live? And maybe more would be done if billions of $$ not wasted on big oil subsidies and pipelines!
1933 2018-09-04 19:51:54 Look at their license? FOX News first. How much propaganda did Murdoch promise you in exchange for you moving that Embassy to Jerusalem so Genie Energy can drill in Golan Heights? Murdoch helped you for more Oil than is in all of Saudi Arabia!

1936 2018-09-04 19:51:24 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
1937 2018-09-04 19:51:21 Ergo, data about Olea europaea is the olive oil.
1938 2018-09-04 19:51:13 Aww I feel so sad for discount Hilary Swank.
1939 2018-09-04 19:51:11 Then, he tried to make it about injustice and standing up to abusive police, in reality, based on his history and the circumstances, he was grandstanding trying to make himself the asset rather than his playing ability.
1940 2018-09-04 19:50:49 That's the effect of abundance oil hahaha! #charot lng!
1941 2018-09-04 19:50:45 Lmfao my boss said “ is that bad that every time I look at the oil I think of CBD”?
1942 2018-09-04 19:50:44 Can't believe I've been betrayed like this, my own father putting olive oil in the water when cooking pasta
1943 2018-09-04 19:50:43 Kamela Harris is the true face of the disgraceful democratic party.  So vindictive, so biased.  She is not worthy of office.  Parhetic. Clown.
1944 2018-09-04 19:50:34 data is the new oil
1945 2018-09-04 19:50:32 Question!! 
If you could put 5-20 drops  of CBD oil under your tongue for the next 30 days, & reduce your chronic pain, sleep better,  take away your anxiety, regrow your hair, get rid of migraines, reduce blood sugar level, reduce nicotine cravings 
Would you try it 
1946 2018-09-04 19:50:23 You are the leader of a national party. That means something. Whether or not we produce oil, the world, including Canada, will still need it. The developing world will NOT be denied the energy they need to rise above poverty.  #cdnpoli #energy #climate
1947 2018-09-04 19:50:18 It is a nice try, since Gorsuch is the justice and not Garland.  So "nice try, it worked, and this is a reminder to everyone that elections have consequences and Harry Reid shouldn't have repealed the judicial filibuster."
1948 2018-09-04 19:50:03 The fact that Dem Senators keep saying "it is more important than ever with this nomination" shows they are ignorant snake oil salesmen. It's only important to them because a Dem isn't appointing.

#EveryAppointmentWasImportant
#Kavanaugh
1949 2018-09-04 19:49:51 And this is the very heart of where we disagree. Not about the comparing Tillman to Kaepernick, because there is no comparison, but in Kaepernick's motives in the first place.

He didn't take his "stand" until his playing ability became an issue.

1954 2018-09-04 19:49:33 No need to apologise - All I've done is copy and paste from oil and gas - take it up with them.
1955 2018-09-04 19:49:32 So funny. I wish I could neuter the guy who waits until we’re an hour and a half into a meeting about public lands oil drilling and then brings up Israel.
1956 2018-09-04 19:49:16 Gone are the days when the focus is solely on oil. With the diversification agenda of President Buhari, we've now seen exploits that can be made take, keeping in view the many jobs the sector has provided for our youths.

1967 2018-09-04 19:47:36 But I thought all along we've been importing crude oil and refining at Mombasa!
1968 2018-09-04 19:47:19 That doesn’t excuse us for being the second largest polluters in the world.  Which is inexcusable being that we are outnumbered by the Chinese. And we have access to technology which gives us the ability to curb emissions but we allow oil barrons to dominate our landscape.

1976 2018-09-04 19:46:38 He makes me just as uncomfortable as Twitler did back when he was just a “real estate tycoon” on tv. He’s more polished & well spoken, but the taint of snake oil is still there.

2044 2018-09-04 19:39:42 To say that Oil prices are low is to admit that our fortunes are tied to Oil. That's a shame, 50 years after we first exported the commodity. And after many opportunities to transform our society through it. Big shame
2045 2018-09-04 19:39:25 I replaced the air filter on my truck and noticed an increase in acceleration and fuel mileage. I replace the air filter every other time I change the Castol Edge oil but should I replace it every oil change?

2058 2018-09-04 19:37:56 Buffet is against pipelines and spends a lot of money to block them and make sure oil is transported by rail.
2059 2018-09-04 19:37:55 You can. You just have to destill it. But that get way more difficult if oil is in the water!

2063 2018-09-04 19:37:17 1. I do care, but shouldn't we start with groups like big pharma and big oil that aren't funded by people wanting to protect their rights?
2. Not true, things like assault weapons bans take guns away.
3. Not really, or else they wouldn't spend a lot on training classes and safety

2067 2018-09-04 19:37:01 The thread tells a different story but whatever you think. I think we are all equal but I do not believe every individual harms our planet equally. I believe we could all be doing more, especially by reducing meat/dairy as it's the worse for the environment than the oil industry.

2089 2018-09-04 19:34:11 @VP Not India, not China, not any other country should be exempted from the oil embargo, until November 4, Iran's oil exports should reach zero until the work of the terrorist regime in Iran is over. Our people are ready for regime change
2090 2018-09-04 19:34:09 As someone who has lost a family member to gun violence, Guttenberg of all people should appreciate the instinctual response of someone to back away when a stranger comes charging up towards them when they shouldn’t. Guttenberg has no right to approach Kavanaugh, period.

the international media is silent!
2092 2018-09-04 19:33:27 #Sidebar Kimani Ichungwa should not be allowed to get away with the falsehoods. There was never any likelihood that Turkana oil would be produced in 2016 nor that it would reduce the cost of local fuel. Kenya has no refinery. We will export it and continue to import refined fuel.
2093 2018-09-04 19:33:19 Actually if the US was any smart; it would block French operations in West Africa and make France pay fair prices for raw uranium (aka unsustainable prices that would force France to accelerate denuclearization of energy)—that would result in France buying American LNG/Shale oil.

2110 2018-09-04 19:31:02 Happy to do it. The more I learn and read, the more I understand the push and/or need for it. I was very glad we legalized CBD oil this year as a start, given it has some very positive impact on people's lives, often ones traditional medicine fails.

2118 2018-09-04 19:30:13 I believe wine & olive oil are perishable. They don't require refrigeration but must be stored at a consistent temperature. 

Much like dairy, fruit is also subject to disease and possibly extreme weather.

I understand your defence of your industry, but you haven't convinced me.
2119 2018-09-04 19:30:06 @VeggieGrill Who are you as a company, really? You have brought back flour tortillas containing hydrogenated oil. Shameful and disgraceful, and you KNOW IT. You are making vegan food, then wrapping it in poison. How do you sleep at night?

2131 2018-09-04 19:28:58 The old oil painting masters like Rembrandt would paint a gray scale version on the canvas first. Not really gray scale but the ochre version of it. They perfected the composition and lighting before adding color glazes on top.

2133 2018-09-04 19:28:49 There are a couple of lies on oil prices: first, UPA left India with a huge Iran oil debt...someone on @SreenivasanJain show made that point. That money is lying with RBI/banks and couldn’t be cleared because of Iran sanctions. That is not a debt because it is accounted for.

2198 2018-09-04 19:20:30 It's so uncomfortable. I'm going to try using some olive oil when I get home and maybe a sinus rinse. If that doesn't work, I'm headed to the doctor.
2199 2018-09-04 19:20:19 Big corporations are buying all the water and waterways. They say it’s the new oil. Has anyone seen the movie about water rationing? The only way to get water was to work at hard labor. They are buying all the water rights in every country they can. Europe has been holding out.
2200 2018-09-04 19:20:17 Touche (turtle)! I recycle as much plastic as I can.  I'm curious, how does the deforestation rate due to the planting of grain to feed livestock compare to that for palm oil? I'm not really a self righteous prick btw ;)

2217 2018-09-04 19:18:24 Ignorant. What would you do to fight for a cause that killed your child?
2218 2018-09-04 19:18:17 Interesting that they are not doing it to the other big oil economies.
2219 2018-09-04 19:18:00 Well now, you just go right ahead and boycott. I wonder though, would you be so adamant if Colin had made an ad for those people that own YOU...say, an oil company or a big bank?

2223 2018-09-04 19:17:27 We could same the same for a lot of things.

Fruit, wine, olive oil, etc. Producers of those products have the exact same issues to deal with. Dairy doesn't seem unique in this regard.
2224 2018-09-04 19:17:25 Still celebrating my birthday last week  No eating cake & lost 3lbs in weight! Was knitting a hat & prepping for tomorrow's knit & natter sessions. Tonight's foot soak is argan oil, local honey, mint & lavender. #selfcare #greenwichhour

2228 2018-09-04 19:17:04 I didn't see any electric cars in Fort McMurray last time I was there.
Its no longer oil or nothing.
Didn't see one wind generator.
Didn't see any solar projects.
A lot of big pickup trucks spewing black smoke.
"Energy" companies should explore all forms of energy.
2229 2018-09-04 19:17:01 Just avoided a slippery situation. The baby oil guy was lathering up as I was leaving! 

2230 2018-09-04 19:16:41 Do you have oil?
2231 2018-09-04 19:16:34 Am on my way to do business in the great country of Saddle Arabia. My son, Donald Trumpony jr. has good relations with the ponies there, so I'm looking to set up another casino, and maybe score some oil rights as well.
2232 2018-09-04 19:16:32 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

WTI finishes the day down after ramping to $71.40. Not good Oil Bulls. outside reversal day very bearish signal.

2236 2018-09-04 19:15:56 Thanks for the very technical question! When the crown is pulled out, the yoke cuts off power to the circuit; it does indeed save battery but the downside is that the movement will have a longer life if allowed to tick: the oil stays evenly distributed and increases longevity.

2251 2018-09-04 19:13:45 I have the Castrol GTX Presents: The Best of SummerSlam VHS that dropped in 2000. My dad had to buy a case of motor oil so I could send in proof-of-purchase to get it.
2252 2018-09-04 19:13:32 It's not about an exchange of ideas. It's about limiting public exposure to  toxic psychological conditioning. "Nationalizing" social media sounds good, in the context of Norway's oil profits, but it's about government control of information.
2253 2018-09-04 19:13:26 i got white oil paint all over my plaid pants

2261 2018-09-04 19:12:08 In a bit to diversify the economy form the miopic dependence on oil, there’s an unprecedented agricultural revolution, making farming lucrative business in Nigeria.

2262 2018-09-04 19:11:59 This is how u know ur an adult now when u get exited about oil changes 
2263 2018-09-04 19:11:57 Our human has frozen some and done a batch of semi-dried which are now sitting in olive oil.  Chutney at some point, but not quite yet. Our human also keeps some friends supplied with tomatoes

2270 2018-09-04 19:11:34 On #5 -- this is simply to point out that "biology, physics, and mechanization" aren't determinant without the simultaneous emergence of the Age of Oil and the availability of petroleum based fertilizers. This isn't about a preferred outcome....
2271 2018-09-04 19:11:33 It's likely the disgust at the oil and chicken-flavored soda
2272 2018-09-04 19:11:26 Went to get my car an oil change and ended up talking to the employee who was helping me about relationships. He told me that he had been with a woman for 14 years and after he lost his job she left him. A year later he met his wife who happened to be his gf is high school.

2274 2018-09-04 19:11:21 Dear @POTUS does America need Saudi oil that much? - wasnt your base built on no more fake wars? - Why is USA supporting ISIS again? 
Please stop this madness enough war - thank you!
2275 2018-09-04 19:11:15 You have to do that because it "seasons" the pan. Basically the oil puts a coating on the pan to help it not rust and preserve it. Lots of ones at big box stores come seasoned already so the customer doesn't have to do it.

2283 2018-09-04 19:10:13 Estradiol levels often rise w/testosterone. Estrogen has heart protective effects.

Use coconut oil instead of lotion, stainless steel over plastic, and use soaps w/o endocrine disruptors.

Biggest factor of low T is obesity. If >15% body fat, best thing to do is lose fat.
2284 2018-09-04 19:10:12 I just remembered that someone told me they didn't think oil paint was still a used media/ hasn't been used since the renaissance and I'm still shocked at how little people know about the art world.

2286 2018-09-04 19:09:59 @realDonaldTrump The full boycott of Iranian oil without exemption is the only way to overthrow this terrorist hive. We emphasize that the oil boycott must be fully implemented without any derogation, this great work must be done.

2289 2018-09-04 19:09:37 @realDonaldTrump Now you are asking how this root is cut off, the only way is a full boycott of oil, the full boycott of oil will ruin this root, and with a flip of our people this root of the terrorist will be cut off.

It’s really important that you’ve raised concern about palm oil
2294 2018-09-04 19:08:53 They're not put in hot oil - you probably spray them and put them in the oven at room temp. 

Can you show me a pic of what they look like? Maybe I'm not envisioning the correct cut.
2295 2018-09-04 19:08:48 Just properly identifying oil and gas tax breaks and subsidies over the years alone would be a full time job. Have you known anyone to actually quantity that amount of data and money? What’s going on with China and the “car”?

2313 2018-09-04 19:05:50 The lack of oil/manpower is one reason Germany had a quality over quantify industrial doctrine. If they just made a lot of panzer IVs rather than Tigers, their tanks wouldn't be functional due to a lack of crew and oil.

2323 2018-09-04 19:04:18 Taking down the global oil industry isn't that big a deal at this point.

Perhaps certain parties should cease mistaking forbearance and compassion with vacillation and weakness.

While we can afford them that grace in the face of their incalculable errors.

2331 2018-09-04 19:03:43 Peel off nail polish is actually less damaging than regular acetone. Especially if you use some nail oil to loosen things up. It's not the peeling, it's the poking at them to get it to peel off, which a good peel off base coat doesn't require.

2356 2018-09-04 19:00:52 That why we need to phase out using oil. We need to stop using it. The sooner the better. Our dependency on it is horrible for our economy.
2357 2018-09-04 19:00:49 The Tories whole existence relies on the current economic orthodoxy. Once it has been seen by enough people to have been a complete betrayal to the people, the Tories will be finished.
Economists are the modern day snake oil salesmen.
2358 2018-09-04 19:00:48 really wish i knew how to change my oil

2360 2018-09-04 19:00:35 I know he really should get into the narrative of, if they have oil or minerals we can take from them, then fuck the consequences.

2367 2018-09-04 19:00:05 THE ART OF DECEPTION is when the big oil, military contractors and pharmaceuticals corporate run government who give unnecessary massive tax cuts to the top 1% while maintaining low wages tells the people that the other party is the “Deep State”. I mean really folks, it’s obvious
2368 2018-09-04 19:00:03 I feel very fulfilled whenever I eat boiled yam and palm oil.
2369 2018-09-04 18:59:56 Democrats are basically just digging a deeper hole that will take decades to fix, if ever.  This charade and their behavior at the Kavanaugh hearing is despicable.  @dnc @cnn @fox
2370 2018-09-04 18:59:51 News of Amazon also passing the trillion mark reminds me, apparently Norway's sovereign wealth fund is now worth 1 trillion, and comprises %1 of the world's stocks and shares. Unlike the UK, they put their North Sea oil revenues into this fund, rather than using it immediately.
2371 2018-09-04 18:59:49 Wasn't that olive oil?
2372 2018-09-04 18:59:46 We have an oil tank outside too.  Got it on a concrete slab.  Our neighbour's tank sprang a leak recently, not pretty!
2373 2018-09-04 18:59:43 C'mon Mr Patterson, give us more than that... 

did oil lobbyists pressure the liberals to fast track consultation? Yes. See @NatObserver.

Did the NEB, filled with industry people, exclude marine shipping? Yes. See FCA ruling.

These are facts. This is big oil's own mess.

2390 2018-09-04 18:58:01 I can say the results was not 100% positive. I'll give 50% to namo gov for now. Can you help me with what we gained from demonetization?
Why oil prices not under gst?
If their is increase in tax profit via gst then why salaried people taxed the same way?
High inflation?
2391 2018-09-04 18:57:54 Who's the girl? And why did she agree?
2392 2018-09-04 18:57:36 Of course, I'd be quiet too if an alleged Russian agent had infiltrated my organization and worked on an oil deal with the former President of the NRA, who then got quickly shuffled out the door. What a mess...
2393 2018-09-04 18:57:35 Bush invaded two countries for oil and natural resources, killed millions and poisoned the survivors with depleted uranium, normalized torture and gave us the Patriot Act. Trump may be a POS but he doesn't make a war criminal like Bush look any better to me.

2396 2018-09-04 18:57:15 It's not economic sanctions it's catsa.. They r not allowing us to buy Russian arms. Also not allowing us to buy oil from Iran. We r adamant we r going through with the purchase
2397 2018-09-04 18:57:08 I will NEVER vote for a democratic candidate again in any election for the rest of my life.  These jackasses on the democratic side have etched that opinion into granite.....and I am embarrassed to say I did vote for Obama the first time.  @DNC @cnn

A Conservative court a threat to the country, a progressive court not.

2399 2018-09-04 18:56:56 
2400 2018-09-04 18:56:52 Elizabeth given the Greens history on any type of oil project does that mean you are back tracking on your position of leaving oil in the ground? Also how do you propose getting Canadian oil to market without having a large discount?

2403 2018-09-04 18:56:28 Tropical Storm #Gordon has shut 9.23 percent of daily crude oil production in the U.S.-regulated Gulf of #Mexico, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said on Tuesday.
2404 2018-09-04 18:56:25 Yes but he probably doesn’t understand oil, not as inert as a lump of coal.....
2405 2018-09-04 18:56:23 You would accept someone saying that stuff about your mom, dad, sister, or brother?
2406 2018-09-04 18:56:23 （このメロンソーダ朝飲む用じゃん。。。）
2407 2018-09-04 18:56:20 It’s akin to commodities trading. You never actually have possession of the lead, coffee, oil, gold or whatever you’re trading. Just trust that the broker is honest

2409 2018-09-04 18:56:07 I’m taking the truck in for an oil change and if I hear “oh is that your dads truck?” one more time there I’m gonna lose it
2410 2018-09-04 18:56:03 Yeah it's about 250 for an oil change on x6m
2411 2018-09-04 18:56:03 When Brendon Urie said “if you love me let me go”, I didn’t feel that. If you love me, you can absolutely get me an oil change
2412 2018-09-04 18:55:51 Only tactics on part of US to explore for their share. If India remains firm, US will waiver as has been doing for India's oil exports from Iran since long when Iran was under crippling sanctions.
2413 2018-09-04 18:55:51 Well sure. But it's clear from context (and who he is) what Gerry means by ‘comics.' If a great and notable oil painter tells you that, nowadays, paintings appeal to adults, I hope you don’t step in to say, “Well actually, WATERCOLOR paintings don't.”

2422 2018-09-04 18:54:12 Easy to cut emissions when your not producing any oil
2423 2018-09-04 18:54:10 I disagree. I hate fascist assholes like we have in our White House and I love seeing them mocked. Ivanka included because she's a part of this White House. You should look up Bob Woodwards new book excepts on Ivanka to get my point
2424 2018-09-04 18:54:09 Oil is going the way of the dinosaur.  Cold turkey is not feasible. phasing out oil consumption towards Renewable carbon free Energy sources is the future. China is going to become the leader in these Technologies if we don’t catch up.
2425 2018-09-04 18:54:09 why is this girl next to me talking bout how she drinks motor oil you dirty white bitch

RIP to Tillman.  So sad.
2430 2018-09-04 18:52:49 interesting how we are an oil producing nation yet we import the thing. Tales are told of how the turkana oil will be exported. ideally there is ready market but... hii government nayo.. #CleanEnergyKe

2442 2018-09-04 18:51:20 Doug: A decade + 3,000 years of war in the Middle East.
It is part of their culture. We will not stop it.
US, UN, NATO, EU, Russia, Australia & others are there to keep access to their oil.

God Bless America, all children, military, police, President Trump & their families.
2443 2018-09-04 18:51:11 It is funny how people against oil will not give up cell phones, food, clothing, etc, right?

2445 2018-09-04 18:51:06 Unfortunately, there are billions involved in the military industrial complex which is also involved in the drug trade, oil and gas. The Trillions of dollars involved means you and I mean jack shit to the sociopathic kleptocrats!

2450 2018-09-04 18:50:36 Yup. I don't have a deep fryer or the desire to burn myself with hot oil (which I would for sure do), so I stick to the basics - slice 'em up and add seasoning and bake, or go lazy with the frozen variety.
2451 2018-09-04 18:50:36 Ad hominem is attacking the person rather than addressing the point. My point was that I disagree with the type of post that I initially commented upon - whether for Ivanka, your family, mine, or anyone.  Agree or disagree?
2452 2018-09-04 18:50:30 -Economy that is purely based on oil turning to Agriculture & Manufacturing
-Reviving rail system of transportation to reduce concentration on road
-Bringing back National Carrrier.
-Creation of Modular Refinery
-Taking port revenue away from Atiku...
...are all restructuring

2455 2018-09-04 18:50:12 The extra 720 oil tanker movements from the #TransMountainPipeline  are just an insignificant part of the 23,000 ship movements a year in Juan de Fuca & Georgia Straits.

Only 3% 

But the court seems to assume TM is responsible for all & any ship movements there.

2459 2018-09-04 18:49:38 Maybe cbd oil no actual high just relaxes
2460 2018-09-04 18:49:35 Sad to see your purple prose silent on economic mismanagement of the country. Petrol bounty went to recapitalize banks, now govt is naked once oil prices are high, criminals are laughing. Happy with being an apparatchik or we will see your ink flow again? Truthfulness demands it.

Fueron cuotas que Oil empezó a pagar

2470 2018-09-04 18:48:43 Yes, Price is higher&affect commodity markets.
Indian economy faces challenges for geopolitical&geoeconomic risks. Persistently high oil prices remain a key risk. Increasing oil prices risks higher inflation&would affect the indian economy

2489 2018-09-04 18:46:12 We know science can be hard for you, but there are ways to remove a drop of oil from water.
2490 2018-09-04 18:46:09 No, I am calling out your behavior. Learn what an ad hominem is and then get back to me.

2493 2018-09-04 18:45:48 In my experience I have found oil and gas stocks hard to trade because they seem to use commodity price movements more than technicals.

2496 2018-09-04 18:45:42 Why is the gas/oil industry allowed to raise the price of gas EVERY TIME Americans will be traveling via automobile more? Why is this NOT price gouging like when stores try to charge more for hurricane supplies when there is a threat of a hurricane @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP?

2499 2018-09-04 18:45:30 It doesn't look or feel oily at all, nor does it smell. How would I identify an oil additive - would that harm the plastic longer term?
2500 2018-09-04 18:45:22 we never should have entered into Cahoots.  I'm sure it was for the oil.  We should get out of Cahoots and leave the Cahootie people alone.
2501 2018-09-04 18:45:16 Oh ok then if they don't want #Lee let them call #Okpara  you see #SA soccer fans we love #TshelePolitics can't we move that #StateCapture mentality of thinking so critically and mixing water and oil those who talk too much let them produce their experience and qualifica

2509 2018-09-04 18:44:04 Similar to the coal & big oil fans.  Once a year, there is a conserve energy day and everyone is asked to turn off lights and save energy.  People make these proclamations, " I'm going to turn on every light in my house."  Nonsensical.

2514 2018-09-04 18:43:33 During this time a lot of industrialization was occurring, oil companies and steel companies where big. Mines as well, so their were a lot of jobs.

2516 2018-09-04 18:43:17 No gasoline, no exhaust, no engine repair, no transmission service and no ignition system.   All around a lower cost of ownership.  The faster this nation gets off oil, the faster we will be a greater nation.

2520 2018-09-04 18:42:46 Yea... They rig Oil, they rig Gold, even most commodities.  The DXY is calculated against other currencies, also ALL rigged.  Over a shorter time span, say 5 years, one can get away with ignoring the effect.  Yet I see the most followed analysts doing this.

2532 2018-09-04 18:41:43 As of 2042, California Democrats outlawed oil. All sources of energy that are not renewable. In their world it will only be solar and wind.
2533 2018-09-04 18:41:38 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
2534 2018-09-04 18:41:38 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2545 2018-09-04 18:40:31 Thank you for clarifying your position. Shale is not different from offshore, deep water or oil sands in ushering in a new chapter of evolving play types as technology, price & demand enable them. I, therefore,respectfully disagree that somehow shale plays are a special category.

2554 2018-09-04 18:39:31 It's not partisan, I am not a registered Dem. It's an ideological and cultural split. I see a very troubled GOP compromised by a few key outside interests and increasingly focused on oil, god and xenophobia only.

2574 2018-09-04 18:37:22 The government isn't capable to cover its expenses because the income isn't enough. Which is because of Socialism. 
The economy went to shit very fast since the goverment destroyed private companies, so tax income is next to non-existent. The oil production did the same.
2575 2018-09-04 18:37:18 its taken a year to get to that and the list of bits god, tank, all the plastics, exhaust, shocks, chain and sprockets, battery, indicators, headlight, bars, tyres, oil changes plugs, brake linings endless.......But only 15000 miles on a very late model, its a cracking bike..

2581 2018-09-04 18:36:43 why would Kenney grin? It's not like he's going to have any success moving a pipeline west. The day is coming in the medium term when the energy costs of oil are so high that there will be no energy subsidy for syncrude & the tap will be turned off permanently. Physics>politics
2582 2018-09-04 18:36:37 I feel like what's happening right now (sad, but true) is they are turning everyone against the Church / Pope while dealing with states that behead people, bomb school buses and steal every other countries oil by force, we are being played big time, enjoy the result lol
2583 2018-09-04 18:36:34 Being a 'steward' I'm no expert but I would be inclined to not totally dismiss an industry voice like oil & gas people. Maybe they are letting their political bias show, unlike you?
2584 2018-09-04 18:36:34 I freaking love having these braids in lol I be washing them and everything lol ... oil & edge control and boom I’m done lol
2585 2018-09-04 18:36:33 More FUD from the short sellers.. Yawn. Why are you such a shill for Big Oil?

2591 2018-09-04 18:36:12 Um on the side, it’s mushrooms and carrots, so you just cook those regularly. We had a little onion too. For the potatoes, you boil them and when they’re finished, drizzle in olive oil and put salt, pepper, chives and cilantro in pot and stir and it all sticks on.
2592 2018-09-04 18:36:06 En el artículo que compartiste: "In Mexico City, the news prompted a rally in the stock and bond markets -- in part because paying off the loans meant that the country no longer needed to put up its oil production revenues as collateral"

2618 2018-09-04 18:33:09 Watch out when those “left squeaky wheels” don’t get their oil, they will try to toil & spoil & just be LEFT to BOIL. @BrettKavanaugh is the gold standard. @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle

2621 2018-09-04 18:32:53 I don't understand why should the V.A.T be increased resulting to an increased fuel price yet oil was earlier discovered in Turkana  ,it really doesn't make  sense
2622 2018-09-04 18:32:46 @Goldman also predicted crude oil to stay lower for longer when at $30 and crude jumped to 75 #Goldman also predicted crude to go to $150 and it went to 30 #Goldman also predicted @amazon to go to $250 when at $350 They are stupid or #crooks.Guess it’s good news for @Tesla #bulls

2624 2018-09-04 18:32:28 First red day in a long while in oil. Ended day with a flurry of trades in oil for a small cut. But took a size-able loss on the earlier sell-off. Will take 6 disciplined intra-day snipe trades to back-fill that day. Cut your losers fast or they'll get you.

2631 2018-09-04 18:32:03 I get the feeling that hemp oil, or some other compound that is has similar olfactory properties to it, might be used somewhere in the production of Subarus. It explains why some elevators smell like a coffeeshop in the Netherlands.

2640 2018-09-04 18:31:24 NI will need a subsidy but not Scotland. You shouldn't believe the figures that Scottish NO vote supply. Scotland can hold their own. As the oil price rises, Scotland will do very well, possibly better than Ireland!

2661 2018-09-04 18:29:08 “Oil is needed either way“? In limited quantities where it can't be substituted, eg. Kerosene for aircraft, maybe. The environmentally responsible response to #climatechange is to wean ourselves off oil, now, not lock us into decades more of fossil fuels with new exploration.
2662 2018-09-04 18:29:08 Iranian government is paying $3 per month to poor Iranian citizens as welfare (yaraneh). Oil production revenue: 2,500,000 (barrels per day) x 30 (days) x 50 (oil price per barrel!)= 3750 million dollars per month!
2663 2018-09-04 18:29:02 This isn't about an honest conversation, Tommy is eager to engage in a dishonest and despicable campaign to smear a good man if it furthers leftist politics. You know, the politics that requires judges to make law because they couldn't get such a law passed in Congress.

2724 2018-09-04 18:22:06 Sigh. This was done by India a while back, Obama’s time, to accept Rupee rather than $$ for oil payment. So not new. And sanctions won’t work.
2725 2018-09-04 18:21:34 Brent traders take note: Iran’s oil exports are falling again as the country’s key buyers in Asia  (their main hope for delivery post-sanctions) take fewer cargoes in the weeks before U.S. sanctions take full effect
2726 2018-09-04 18:21:16 But I will say this: the MASSIVE taxation hike on consumers by this administration could never produce positive growth numbers. Literally ECON101. Tough choices were made: stabilize deficit crisis, oil prices are climbing, domestic capital holding us hostage, stagnant industry
2727 2018-09-04 18:21:16 ..one more thing... actually the product I bought was 100% legal even 7 years ago because it was sold as Hemp cBD oil.. which hemp product is legal.
2728 2018-09-04 18:21:14 They like Saudi oil.
2729 2018-09-04 18:21:05 We know what you are getting at. Did you enjoy fuel at N87 per litre even though oil was selling above 100dpb. Yes. We drank our oil bum together.

2738 2018-09-04 18:20:10 If we stop supporting the wars that create refugees, and sending our soldiers to die for the sake of oil and other vested interests, then we wouldn't need to take so many refugees in. That's another thing the 'Far Left' want to do, stop the wars.

2748 2018-09-04 18:19:12 Whats the point of producing oil, coffee and other materials, export them in their raw form only to import them at more than 53% tax passed down to the same farmer or worker.??  #newsnight
2749 2018-09-04 18:19:09 I'm tempted to nip out and see if Rajous has a lemon or some squeezy lemon juice now. I've a ton of mint to play with and the only issue I had with olive oil in malkied tatties is where it could get a bit heavy IMO. I can imagine the lemon & mint balancing that.

2755 2018-09-04 18:18:42 Yawn. No I don't dive a car. I'm on a 100‰ renewable tariff. Of course energy is used in production of stuff, so I try and use less stuff and make it last longer. That's about all anyone living in a consumer society can reasonably do. But I don't gloat about or profit from oil.
2756 2018-09-04 18:18:41 Anyone checking engine oil before setting off to @goodwoodrevival . Keep hold of the Oil Filler cap. Do not drop it to the depths of your engine bay, you will probably spend the best part of 2hrs trying to get it back. a long  wired Bristle Bush eventually did the trick

2758 2018-09-04 18:18:36 yeah, turns out that it had been draining coolant into the engine at that point (as opposed to /just/ oil).

oh well.
2759 2018-09-04 18:18:27 Norway works due to its oil resource & acceptance of big gov.    
Canada is/was a near perfect balance of capitalism & socialism. Sadley current federal elitist gov is tipping the scale towards marxist communism, w\ no plan to forfeit their elitist, cronyism, trust fund club!

2764 2018-09-04 18:18:07 The government is forcing inflation on a wide scale from this debt issue to the VAT and all these other taxes. They seem small but they are significant to a family that has to buy 10 bob of oil daily for food ... imagine what else
2765 2018-09-04 18:17:49 If I pick my nail polish too often my nails/nailbeds themselves get thin/weak. To give them TLC a short soak in water & some oil (whatever is your fave for hands/face) really makes them feel great! (also one can do this if they don't pick at nails but idk who those people are.)
2766 2018-09-04 18:17:31 honey flavored or olive oil?
2767 2018-09-04 18:17:08 Is cbd oil a sponsor of yours mate?
2768 2018-09-04 18:16:40 So I was stressing so hard about money and then yesterday I found the book I need for 30$ rather than 150 and I just got told my oil change is going to be free

2770 2018-09-04 18:16:36 Ben, this is precisely the reason so many conservatives held their noses like taking a bad spoonful of cod liver oil & votes Trump. 2016 was all about the next SCOTUS picks. 

I hope GBR is taking her daily multivitamins. 2024 is a long way off!

2775 2018-09-04 18:15:56 RIP Pat Tillman. Rather than trying to elect officials who won’t send kids off to war to fight for oil, we’re gonna argue about who should be the focus of Nike’s ad campaign. Sorry you got dragged into this.

2784 2018-09-04 18:14:45 I finally decided to buy 5ml bottles of @bpal perfume oil for myself. I settled on “Fallen” and “The Black Tower,” my favorite scents. Next, I want to get “Anubis,” then something Heathen-y and something Roman.

2791 2018-09-04 18:14:03 Oil changes should be free @ your dealership
2792 2018-09-04 18:13:52 When did oil changes get so damn expensive
2793 2018-09-04 18:13:50 Thank you babe! Honestly I got them in dollarama at craft section  and just put baby oil before and have assistant to help  spread spread them equally 
2794 2018-09-04 18:13:37 ผมคับ
2795 2018-09-04 18:13:33 It would help more if they banned palm oil which now seems to be in everything.
2796 2018-09-04 18:13:28 N.Y. Times article was spot on about the next financial crisis being underground. Oil companies are bleeding cash...$9 billion per quarter. Inflated reserves. Wall St. Pumping because they've made a ton on fees. Will crash.
2797 2018-09-04 18:13:23 Same problem with my 2012 @chevrolet equinox; will never go Chevy again. Not only is it inconvenient to have a bad engine burning oil, but customer service at @RockvilleChevy was very frustrating. Talked me into spending $500+ on a repair without mentioning the known piston issue
2798 2018-09-04 18:13:17 Wish I could get close enough to your cute face to smell that pumpkin spice beard oil for myself! :P

2800 2018-09-04 18:12:52 Uh they only got to make such a nice presentation because THEY'RE FUNDED BY BIG OIL AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS. Tesla is a startup, without them none of this would exist at ALL.. Idiot shorts with the FUD again.

That's my best impression, how'd I do?
2801 2018-09-04 18:12:44 I have eczema, I used magnolia tissue oil from Pep, it’s R10. It took a month for the marks to fade away.
2802 2018-09-04 18:12:43 Success! I think the weird noise was it heating up? (Oil expanding, maybe?) and now I have heat! I'm still wrapped in several layers BUT my teeth aren't chattering and I was able to take off my fingerless gloves!

2804 2018-09-04 18:12:39 If you phone falls into hot frying oil, what is the first thing to do?
2805 2018-09-04 18:12:39 The fuel increases are because of Zuma administration wiped out the Road Accident Fund which needs those funds recovered through petrol increases. Another reason is that Trump pulled out of the Iran deal and sanctioned the country, which sent the oil price sky rocket.
2806 2018-09-04 18:12:30 This needs to be read by the masses, as an oil worker this article hits home

There have been at least 11 close calls of some sort, a few disturbing loud crashes, and I want to pour boiling oil over the castle walls.
2809 2018-09-04 18:12:07 You could make a great chili oil and just use a drop or two for cooking!!

2816 2018-09-04 18:11:30 If you were serious about the species, and no just biased against oil, you’d demand the IMMEDIATE cessation of all shipping into Vancouver, including container ships, cruise vessels, ferries, etc.
2817 2018-09-04 18:11:27 Overjoyed to learn that Europa Oil and Gas are pulling out of Leith Hill @SaveLeithHill @natalieben This is a great testimony to years of campaigning for the environment.
2818 2018-09-04 18:11:26 You’re right, we all live in the same atmosphere. You tell me what will do more for our atmosphere, trying to convince everyone to buy our “clean ethical” oil... or winding down the oilsands of our own accord. I know the answer. Do you want to end CO2 emissions or not?

2835 2018-09-04 18:09:26 @nitin_gadkari  Based on the petroleum products price rise & the high level of pollution, can we expedite the move to electric transporation. At minimum, let's provide incentive to people to buy those via tax breaks. It is required for environment conservation & reduce  oil bill
2836 2018-09-04 18:09:25 Another point. Your delivery person doesn't open box for us to verify for short supply, incorrect supply, or damaged goods.

2840 2018-09-04 18:09:00 I mentioned Shale companies are just like all the other emerging industry, not the entire oil & gas industry. The example of iPhone was a analogy to show that a product or technology can be considered innovative w/o having the need to be connected to the history of that industry.

2869 2018-09-04 18:05:42 And Canada is leading the way. Look at our climate policies. By forcing supply reductions on a small part of the world oil supply (Canada) all you are doing is funding countries with zero environmental regulations or human rights standards. We do not exist in a vacuum.

2887 2018-09-04 18:03:40 But you want to ramp up oil production.  Not really in tune with what snp are saying is it?
2888 2018-09-04 18:03:40 $RRL has oil and gas assets producing 100/k a month to fund their mj developments.. aka no burn rate. Same assets here are worth 20-30m. In a year I’d expect them to sell these imo and be solely mj.
2889 2018-09-04 18:03:35 only wash it with hot water without soap and oil it after you're done and put it away.. you could burn it in with a peanut / sunflower oil for a few times, there's some 'tutorials' on google, just have to crank the heat up just with oil in it for a few times.
2890 2018-09-04 18:03:25 Yabba. It's early diwali exporters. Windfall sales as demand for cheaper indian products will pick up. It's imports (largely oil) are a problem.

Next time you want to say stuff like this, don't fall your own pomposity.
2891 2018-09-04 18:03:15 Most of the recent wars we start are meant to be unwinnable. They are meant to be milked for the war and oil economies.
2892 2018-09-04 18:02:59 You really are profoundly ignorant of history, politics, and how your society works.

You must be a helluva snake oil salesman to have become so successful.

2898 2018-09-04 18:02:38 People should really listen to this statement.

2905 2018-09-04 18:02:22 19th hair styling was also different. U just can't do a lot of 19th century hairstyles without the oil that people would consider dirty today. It changes the texture;allows a lot more complex interplay. This doesn't look like a complex do from the front, but I'm guessing back is.

2924 2018-09-04 17:59:26 Testify!

There are approximately zero days without one or the other and normally both.  I'm aware of the putative health benefits but I just love the taste and versatility!  My cooking does tend toward olive oil and garlic.....
2925 2018-09-04 17:59:25 Once in Peshawar long ago to be exact in 92 bought a Russian Olive oil bottle from Hayatabad. Thankfully it was water in it. @RanaRiazSaeed was witness to it

Now crude and fuel prices on white paper to show. How they benefit to few industrialists. And common people penalised for all yr
2949 2018-09-04 17:57:08 And that's the reason for low oil prices.

2960 2018-09-04 17:55:10 it wasn’t finished until last year. I stood inside the damn pipe, and I promise there was no oil flowing at the time.
2961 2018-09-04 17:54:51 I got a blood test that ruled out both, but I haven't looked into other deficiencies.  Is Neem oil that stuff that smells awful?
2962 2018-09-04 17:54:45 Skin oil?
2963 2018-09-04 17:54:45 This same Company "Transcorp" acquired 3 business interest from 4 Nigeria oil blocks,OPL218,209,219,and 220 allocated on july 21 2005,Nicon-Hilton for $105m and Nitel for $750m. Waziri can never deny this
2964 2018-09-04 17:54:44 Yes of course and I am far from perfect but try to do my bit. I've managed to restrict myself to a ant based diet and have the onus on this rather than palm oil. Which does more damage to the earth do you think?

2972 2018-09-04 17:53:32 90% of the junk we export to the US they can get elsewhere, there is only one commodity they value and that is oil which they buy at a heavily discounted price. Turn the valves off now and build those pipelines to the east and west coasts now !

2987 2018-09-04 17:51:47 my advisor at my car dealership always flirt with me when i come in for an oil change and today he finally asked me for my number. maybe i haven’t lost my juice after all.

2996 2018-09-04 17:50:32 Yeah, you just gotta follow the money. Beeching first report was 1963, with big time drilling for oil in the North Sea from 1964. It’s all linked, big oil getting their way. Apparently it was the US calling the shots at the time, but loved and embraced by the UK profiteers.
2997 2018-09-04 17:50:25 Yup, I have to check that out. The other thing is "cotton" is regularly accused but somehow it is not included in the House Report on Combine. The main culprit are coal oil, sugar and ... oatmeal (I was not expecting that). There is a paper that is easy to write on the latter.

3002 2018-09-04 17:49:57 Nigeria was the world's largest producer of palm oil. Nigerians abandoned palm oil because of crude oil.

3013 2018-09-04 17:48:26 So, when will the US build some pipelines so we on the east coast can share our excessive water with the west coast?
Screw oil pipelines we need water pipelines!
3014 2018-09-04 17:48:23 Y’all I just want to share this with you: a little jojoba oil + 1 drop of frankincense essential oil is the best moisturizer ever for dry skin and clears acne but still moisturizes and it’s incredible okay xo
3015 2018-09-04 17:48:23 Why does Canadians thinks we need water ?  We got water, billions of gallons from our Delta. Also from mount Shasta due to snow. We got drought before but water still there. It was diverted by our government for salmons. With Power , we got solar and oil.
3016 2018-09-04 17:48:20 I made a brown sugar, honey, olive oil & lemon zest scrub (for body, lips & face), a ground coffee & honey scrub (for body & under eyes), and a baking soda & lemon scrub (for face - it’s like a microdermabrasion treatment so it should only be used once a week)
3017 2018-09-04 17:48:19 Canada is in the middle of a global economic power struggle Between the US and the rest of the Global players club.  Oil is the chips being used on the table. If we flood the Asian markets with cheap energy the US no longer has power to negotiate other business.

3021 2018-09-04 17:47:30 what about the lakhs of crores in unpaid oil bills that Congress left behind ? was going to come back to bite sometime or the other. bjp kept inflation in check while paying off these debts.

3031 2018-09-04 17:45:21 Oil Prices Have Been Rising And $4 A Gallon Gasoline Would Put Enormous Stress On The U.S. Economy, even though US production has risen to all time highs, prompting exports?
3032 2018-09-04 17:45:20 Mps should stop their hypocritical sympathy, they passed the budget with no single amendment.  The issue of oil VAT has been on postment for two good years yet no measure taken#Sidebar
3033 2018-09-04 17:45:16 RIGHT? AUGH the prepackaged stuff always adds water or vinegar or ... or sunflower oil?! I don't even know, it's wrong wrongness, all the extra nonsense shoved into it is to disguise the wrongness.

3037 2018-09-04 17:44:33 Investing our hydrocarbon money by preparing for a renewable future would be sensible. I remember being told oil would only last 10 years when I was at high school... why has WM not invested in & prepared Aberdeen for a future without oil?

3041 2018-09-04 17:44:09 u forget all the unpaid oil bills that Congress left behind. it's good work done by bjp to pay the bills and control inflation. If fuel prices r such a big issue, why doesn't congress reduce VAT in their states ?
3042 2018-09-04 17:44:07 I don't always use butter for mine, usually just a splash of olive oil. Honestly you could probably skip that too with an extra bit of pasta water. 
The point of the SE recipe is using the 2nd pan to avoid clumping. Works everytime for me, and no need for expensive gadget.

3045 2018-09-04 17:43:45 No doubt that it had some value, but wasn't his main original business oil? That has intrinsic value. The Polish experience makes me very skeptical of the claims of high value of communist era public investments and infrastructure that were not tied to natural resources
3046 2018-09-04 17:43:45 The US wants a controlling force over the global oil markets. If Canada sells its resources to other global players , the US has no control of the worlds 3rd largest oils supply. It’s in its best interest to disrupt our supply management issue.

3051 2018-09-04 17:43:27 Difference between Economics & Pakodanomics

Economics - Increase the Gross Domestic Product qualitatively to achieve inclusive development.

Pakodanomics - Increase the price of Gas, Diesel and Petrol to benefit oil companies at the cost of common man.

3065 2018-09-04 17:41:52 When people say "oligarchs just stole natural resources" they seem to believe we live in Robinson Crusoe world where coconuts just lie on the ground and you  pick them up. To exploit gas, oil, nickel, gold you need huge investments, esp. when many are in Siberia or the Arctic.

3071 2018-09-04 17:41:22 In 2013 under the rule of so called world class economist inflation was at 10-12% and petrol was around Rs 78-79. @narendramodi leveraged the benefit of lower oil prices to build 2 cr toilets, longer highways etc and your dumb PM allowed Rajas to florish and loot.

3089 2018-09-04 17:39:29 True. We actually went as high as 66% when oil price was at a record low in 2016. We were at 45% by 2017 while current budget projects 28%.

Tried the hair oil on my hand as not sure and ended up with burn blisters on my hand. How can you advertise something as Ouai product and sell something fake?
3093 2018-09-04 17:39:00 You think it is completely okay to run our country like a banana republic and appoint family to civic jobs within our government. You can take the entire kleptocratic oligarchic bunch and stick them up your bunghole. & if you think I am "uncivil" you should watch a Trump rally
3094 2018-09-04 17:38:55 This! And the coconut oil inversion method.
3095 2018-09-04 17:38:53 It would be nice to get the best price for Canadian oil and use the tax income to transition away from domestic use of energy by subsidizing technology that reduces home energy use. Per capita use of energy in Canada is high because we have cold winters, stop heating your house
3096 2018-09-04 17:38:50 Not a lot out there. Most will be on the streets for a while, retire or change sectors if they have transferable skills. Very sad at $70 pre-diff oil.

3152 2018-09-04 17:32:59 A3. I am an essential & carrier oil DIY fanatic, actually an oil user in general, but I use eucerin for my sunscreen & toner needs. #StyleChatZA
3153 2018-09-04 17:32:48 Isn’t canola oil the same as rapeseed oil?
3154 2018-09-04 17:32:47 "Olive oil is the key. To your life..." -@errol33. I'm always learning something around him! Great seeing you.
3155 2018-09-04 17:32:24 Now I have to invest in some peppermint oil to make a bug spray to bless my car since a wasp wanna build his love shack in my trunk. No sir.
3156 2018-09-04 17:32:22 Another young mans life, wasted being soldier, fighting for oil interests and political patronage.  How did that "Freedom" he was delivering go?  Afghanistan is doing GREAT right?  Good thing we got Bin Laden there, that was the reason we went, right?  Oh wait, that was Pakistan.

3161 2018-09-04 17:31:48 Ah, perhaps in Tesla context is ‘non car person.. is no oil, save the earth’. Us gear heads are a different league.. and in my lifetime Lexus has been fantastic as well as Hondas in the day... but to be forward, I’m a chevy muscle car / hot rod guy. I’m cool w/ EVs, just not yet

3181 2018-09-04 17:29:30 Perhaps not, but we’ll never know if Rahic rolled out the snake oil and the promise of fame and fortune. That or he probably saw himself out of a job, which he may well be now. Whatever the circumstances it was wrong and naive of Rahic to make the appointment in the first place.
3182 2018-09-04 17:29:23 Something about Williamson brings out the worst in people. He’s not a man to pour oil on troubled waters.
3183 2018-09-04 17:29:19 Conservatives are really bad at this boycott thing.

I'm reminded of when they bought a shit ton of French wine in 2003 and then poured it into the gutter 'cause France wouldn't join their war for oil.
3184 2018-09-04 17:29:11 Coconut oil   >>  Everything

3186 2018-09-04 17:29:03 We are wrongly paranoid about butter, coconut. Both are necessary to lubricate your innards so do not shit perfect bricks.
The fear is promoted by cheap oil blender multinationals and doctors in their payroll.

3189 2018-09-04 17:28:28 If Scotland is to become and remain truly independent we need to stay away from IMF debt, trade our oil in our own currency and probably beware of ‘Regime change’ operations too...
3190 2018-09-04 17:28:22 You want to order perfume oil?
3191 2018-09-04 17:28:20 Yes cap controls is a good point. Obvious as well that so much of left indy would be more likely if a devolved gov was moving towards that, but no attempt to move away from oil or financial sector. Leaves economy vulnerable and weighted towards interest of owners of capital.

3200 2018-09-04 17:27:33 If only big oil hadn't pressured the libs to fast track the consultation...

3203 2018-09-04 17:26:54 Tried a pie from the new Fried Pies on 13th & Tyler this past Sunday. Save your money, it was trash. Cold ass pie, literally cold. Dirty oil flavor. Overcooked crust. They've been open a week. Yet another disappointment.

3206 2018-09-04 17:26:20 Got some tomatoes for £1 a bowl (12 toms 5cm diameter) at a market stall yesterday. Decided to quarter them & roast as I usually do for cherry tomatoes (spritz with oil & in 160-180C oven). After 30 mins however, the tomatoes were in a tray of juice, partially roasted & steamed
3207 2018-09-04 17:26:09 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest. Congress won't tell you this.

3213 2018-09-04 17:24:46 Modi assured all support and offered to put India in the global oil hike race, that can formulate futuristic plan for hungry India. RSS  Office also appreciated the Modi's vision to set up a rich care centre to cater to the needs of the corporates.

3217 2018-09-04 17:24:00 Oil prices are on hike and opposition parties are on sleep mode, it seems they dont want to fight for 2019. Its democracy come pressurize the gov to do something on this issue

Using a lip mask and a lip oil with keep them looking hydrated and moisturized . Using lip oil is better to use instead of lipgloss

3222 2018-09-04 17:23:24 I stopped getting breakouts & pimples when I started using oil free .. oil based moisturizers/washes are not for oily skins.

3226 2018-09-04 17:23:07 They wont see this one, if its to yap on how he didnt respond 2 corruption they will come out. In three years, this govt earned $121 billion on oil revenues and at the same time have us $21 billion indebted. I am not an atiku nor pyo supporter but these men should stop fooling us
3227 2018-09-04 17:22:55 Last night I was super faded and decided I wanted to do a coconut oil peel off face mask.... I ended up knocking out right after and then I woke up this morning freakn out cause I realized I still had it on. But long story short my face got 75% clearer than what it looked like
3228 2018-09-04 17:22:53 You all can play politics with the ND oil all you like. Britain did not leave us with this flawed constitution scripted by the military. The story of Nigeria is how majority ganged up against a few. Is this not why you killed Saro Wiwa, Isaac Boro, etc and polluted our lands?
3229 2018-09-04 17:22:36 Ziauddin hospital in Karachi  wonderful Research center how quickly wiski change to  Honey and OLIVE OIL  there

Be aware the oil DOES stain so place cloth between poultice and whatever the child's head lay against. I'm not a physician but have seen this situation before. The oil worked. GOD knows the child's future.
3236 2018-09-04 17:21:32 @ZeeNews,@BJP4India ,@narendramodi, State govt.have funds to advertise ,but no fund for reducing taxes on oil products,misuses of public funds only.

3239 2018-09-04 17:21:07 The Canadian central bank has always been relatively easy, yet forward looking in policy. Canadians may be less able to absorb price increases than some may think given rent and housing, but the currency is typically correlated to oil, not the domestic economy

3263 2018-09-04 17:18:23 Javier, what's your opinion on the change reg. RUB/ USD vs oil price? Is it merely sell USD , buy gold?
3264 2018-09-04 17:18:21 It hurts my bank account every time I have to get an oil change, but here I am still getting my nails done

3270 2018-09-04 17:17:41 Hasn't had an oil change since 08
3271 2018-09-04 17:17:29 haha yes... I don't know, but just that "oil business" it's the tip of the iceberg. As I said, things are deeply fucked up in this place. Anyways, nowadays everybody trying to save their asses from this place or get enough money so they can eat well. It's survival madness
3272 2018-09-04 17:17:24 I once tripped on a step and fell through a door.  I stayed there on the floor for like 10 mins b4 I thought it was about time to get up... I'm cursed as well BC last night I spilled hot oil down my leg and there was a spider on the floor and I ended up on a chair...
3273 2018-09-04 17:16:57 Every time I see someone fry something on a cooking show, I automatically think, “I can’t afford to use that much oil.”
3274 2018-09-04 17:16:25 No, due to a socialist model who started in 60's. When the government forced the nationalization of the oil industry in . The corruption, hight Deficit , poverty and indoctrination are part of the tragedy. I am Venezuelan by the way

3283 2018-09-04 17:15:32 I had the same problem with this brand. They don’t dilute the essential oils in it enough with a carrier oil before they mix it into the rest of the ingredients so you basically get a chemical burn. Especially painful if you just shaved 
3284 2018-09-04 17:15:15 Let me know when you protest in  Russia and Saudi Arabia to “save the world” by stoping oil production! Then I’ll be impressed

3290 2018-09-04 17:14:45 They do this because of the fish oil used in making the plastic bags. I know a cat who has the biggest plastic bag fetish.
3291 2018-09-04 17:14:35 I won’t be putting juices in berries in my hair for the winter cause my hair will STAY in braids the whole season and spill over into the next seasons lol. I don’t wanna touch it at all! Just oil my scalp and make sure it’s adequately moisturized and that’s about it! 
3292 2018-09-04 17:14:30 Major produce of Canada are minerals & oil like nickel, zinc etc, which though add to GDP, but has limited impact on economy. What will the state of economy without NAFTA?. Look what happened to Quebec, after all capital &  trade shifted to Ontario, some while ago.

3298 2018-09-04 17:13:36 I'll take your word for it. In her place, we'll put the coal guy who replaced swampy Pruitt (oil guy) to head the EPA, and immediately reduced regulations against coal dust. Trump gave the State Dept. to Exxon Mobil, and the Treasury and SEC to Goldman Sachs! But you say "if".
3299 2018-09-04 17:13:31 He's comparing the difference in what "sacrifice everything" means to the left vs what he feels it should mean.  He provided the pictures to make his point.
Do you get it now?
3300 2018-09-04 17:13:28 I guess it's a red herring if you want world oil supply to be met by OPEC dictatorships. I want Canada to supply as much of that oil as possible during the transition away from fossil fuels.

3302 2018-09-04 17:13:12 Americans have lost jobs due to all those tariff against us . Now, once those manufacturing industry like steel get resurrected.  What will happen to Canada ?  That was the same fear the former King of Saudi had. When oil prices have gone up. We had to ramp up production.
3303 2018-09-04 17:12:59 "Canada's focus on natural gas will be based on exporting it and using gas in the oil sands development process, the latter accounting for a third of the country's total gas usage." - Today, sure. But ending gas in oil sands extraction is industry goal, so...

3320 2018-09-04 17:11:47 It's an essential oil, but meant to be ingested. Comes in a liquid (which tastes very strong) and also capsules. Hopefully you can find some!

3322 2018-09-04 17:11:35 I can recommend CBD oil for everyone. 
No guarantees, but it’s simple, easy and harmless. 

And it truly gave me my life back. 
Almost all food made my belly hurt, after only 2 drops I could eat again 

But I’m a really sensitive person

3345 2018-09-04 17:09:36 No, I’d rather run a car with no oil in it for months on end than own that

3386 2018-09-04 17:04:54 No, definitely not a Trumpite. They would make the wind turbine run on oil to blow the wind the other way.
3387 2018-09-04 17:04:49 Is 500 kb/d from legacy decline? Total production is not declining. 

Weakened consumption is probably more relevant than demand destruction. It is independent of decline rates & is an expression of reduced affordability. 

Demand may remain high but people consume less oil.
3388 2018-09-04 17:04:39 Government will purchase oil for Electricity therefore prices of petrol and diesel reduced. Electricity Tariff increased by Rs. 2 to recover circular debt from people who voted PTI #NayaPakistan

3390 2018-09-04 17:04:03 @SreenivasanJain  In the last 12 months fuel prices rose by Rs.15, in which States VAT component was Rs 5. Why is this point not raised in your debate today? If states can reduce VAT, fuel price can come down by 5Rs which they earned only due to increase in oil prices
3391 2018-09-04 17:03:57 put some oil on it

3394 2018-09-04 17:03:34 we don't have oil. Oil companies have oil. If this model that she proposes will not affect any one because the outlying provinces will get their oil and refined products from companies at world market value. It they wanted the oil to be ours they should have suported NEP
3395 2018-09-04 17:03:29 Engine oil.. haha Khair joth tu nahi hai.. Sharabi ke liyeah Sharab is like Honey and engine oil coz this is the oil which keeps you running ...

3397 2018-09-04 17:03:28 You must get it to market. If its stuck in the province, no way to move it: it stays put in the ground. The market continues to thrive on middle east blood oil

3407 2018-09-04 17:02:03 Apparently Woodruff tapes most of his sources. He's a real journalist, and this book is going to sting more than fire and fury as it can withstand scrutiny.
3408 2018-09-04 17:02:01 Coconut oil solidifies at room temperature, same as pork fat.
3409 2018-09-04 17:01:40 You may have to diversify that economy. Yes we need the oil but there is a lot of opposition to pipelines. Too bad 45 yrs of Tory mismanagement did not get enough royalties 4 oil. Look at Norway-Trillion $ trust fund while Alberta nearly bust. Solutions?

3428 2018-09-04 17:00:11 We very know that democracy was decoy to kill and destroy a strong panafricanistwas agenda number one, the fear of gold backed currency was two, the valuation and sale of oil in currency other than dollar was three, the payback for Lockerbie flight was something else.

3435 2018-09-04 16:59:19 Same with oil. Oil can't go up or markets fail. Sticks can't go up or the VIX becomes unstable. Crypto is the easy out for all the inflationary $ and U.S. treasuries being sold on the market coming back to the U.S.

So it is always better to take pain for long term gains....for brighter future......
3459 2018-09-04 16:57:18 Fyi...crude price was $120 in 2012. Still then they had a control. Now crude oil is $70/barrel. Make an analogy with this.

Go to the evangelical church, with prayer of determination, where the leader will anoint you with the oil sacred by faith, in Jesus. Believe.

3530 2018-09-04 16:51:21 The short term price moves in oil are usually not too rational. Plus oil went up very hard in the last two weeks. Give it time. Maybe 1-2 months and we will break above 70 for good.

But, they are loosing. As America goes (Russia and Korea too), so does the world.

3555 2018-09-04 16:48:40 @BillyZfrom313 What's the truth about CBD oil? Is the hype true?

1) burn ALL THE OIL in the next fourteen months years. Every little bit of it.
3) EVERYONE meets their Paris Agreement commitments, because no nation has a carbon output.

3573 2018-09-04 16:46:41 The honey and olive oil saga is a damning indictment of the whole justice system. If the integrity of a raid conducted by the senior most judicial officer is questioned imagine how rotten the rest of the system is.

3588 2018-09-04 16:45:21 #DivietoTip If you're washing things like greens and mushrooms right before cooking them, make sure they're totally dry before adding them to the pan. Otherwise, the excess water means they'll steam (and splatter, and get soggy) once they hit the oil.

Do you seriously want to discuss that pathetic performance against Daimler?
3610 2018-09-04 16:43:31 If you are a Business. You pay a mechanic to change the oil. You are so off topic. When we were talking about running businesses. And you had to bring yourself into it. You keep doing it and you don’t even know it. Your arrogance is on another level.

3612 2018-09-04 16:43:17 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest. Congress won't tell you this.
3613 2018-09-04 16:43:16 We dont live in a true republic. We live in an oligarchy controlled by a wealthy few & their investments in oil, weapons and pharmacueticals. You can find the reports of first responders & witnesses as well as technicians that support 9/11 was staged. It was a financial decision.

It’s just another ridiculous hoop to go thru.

3636 2018-09-04 16:40:52 That's odd bc one of my coworkers is on chemo and her doctor prescribed her high doses of CBD oil for her pain and queasiness.

3647 2018-09-04 16:40:14 Things change. So what ? I was bearish NG last year then the coldest temp in in 60 years came along and I stopped out quick. This is the way life works. If China starts to have a financial meltdown you will see me reverse and go short oil. And so on.
3648 2018-09-04 16:40:13 Nobody seems to care that gas prices are at 4-year highs and oil looks to be going higher.  How many consumers are left to buy $90,000 vehicles?
3649 2018-09-04 16:40:12 *sends extra biscuits* Does the CBD oil help?
3650 2018-09-04 16:40:08 Venezuela is an absurd comp. it’s economy is singularly based on oil and it’s been run by authoritarians for generations. Look at Nordic capitalism.

3663 2018-09-04 16:39:17 Russia's economy is as good as the oil price allows. A new oilfield somewhere in the world could bankrupt Russia. We saw that in 2014-15. If oil prices had stayed low Russia would have collapsed. The drastic fall in oil prices in 1985 probably helped bring USSR down.

3680 2018-09-04 16:37:58 Canola is rapeseed oil. Genetically modified versions of canola / rapeseed became available in the late 1990s.
Because it is an aerial inseminated plant and the pollen travels for miles; we can safely say there is a large chance it is all gmo now.

3694 2018-09-04 16:37:02 Are we sticking to the topic? I respect McCain's service and his accolades. But there are some hard fallacies behind McCain that should be noted. Trump and McCain were like oil and vinegar. A dossier (buyoff)? Would you respect someone that stabbed you in the back?

3700 2018-09-04 16:36:30 The fact that H. Clinton was the last Dem cand for POTUS shows how Center/Right the mainstream Dem Party has swung.  Love corp. donations, frequent warhawks, ok with Oil & Banks getting govt $$$$.  But, it’s ok because they like Roe and LGBTQ, right?

They’re more Reagan than FDR

3708 2018-09-04 16:35:28 I don't wsnt to pick a fight, but so far no one is doing a good job of fixing anything. The poor are getting poorer by the month because we rely on imports to feed our people, and the Rand is in the toilet so food gets more expensive as does the fuel because of importing oil.
3709 2018-09-04 16:35:14 Dont worry when their oil is gone they will be back to dig up every last shovelful of ours

3713 2018-09-04 16:34:48 Nobody will consider the drop in corruption or the stent prices lowered or the generic medicine outlets opened or money inflow in Govt treasury but only oil prices matter.
3714 2018-09-04 16:34:44 Hot oil treatments, vitamin C and dandruff shampoo, maybe a light bleach bath mixed with coconut oil (I’ll find a link), and a color remover if necessary
3715 2018-09-04 16:34:42 It was capitalism that ended child labor and pollution. Snake oil is fraud and that's obviously a crime. You don't need regulations to put fraudsters in jail.

What do you think kids did before capitalism? Worked on farms and 50% died before age 10. Now, they don't have to.
3716 2018-09-04 16:34:42 @rahulkanwal yr debate on Oil price wud b interesting, but the sight of @JhaSanjay made me switch off yr channel. Y do U bring such repulsive character?

3721 2018-09-04 16:33:49 once again, he bought a 65 year old leaky pipeline that exists for 4.5 billion, he now wants to spend 10 billion to build another one, it's nothing you wouldn't do, you are owned by the deep state of oil too.

3731 2018-09-04 16:32:53 This is a red herring. We do purchase our own oil. Transmountain is not going to add anything to the amount of oil we purchase for our own use. We have more than we need. Thus the "need" for export capacity.

3738 2018-09-04 16:32:07 @trimet @trimethelp your LIFT bus vehicle 9732 travrlling on 99W NB in Tigard is burning oil & smoking heavily.
3739 2018-09-04 16:31:52 The dairy argument is bs. American dairy is suffering due to over supply. The dairy tariffs are to prevent huge yearly American dairy surpluses from being dumped here and wiping out the entire industry. Don't hear u complaining about 25 dollar a barrel discount on oil.
3740 2018-09-04 16:31:48 Atiku's second reply was epic abeg. I particularly like how he rubbished the narrative that GEJ earned the highest oil revenue n mismanaged the economy reminding PYO that Obj & himself in office earned a quarter of the $121billion they have earned yet paid of a $30billion debt.
3741 2018-09-04 16:31:44 Do you know  that

*Coal is the world's most abundant fossil fuel - more plentiful than oil and natural gas

*Coal is second only to oil as a source of energy that we use.

*Coal generates approximately 40% of the world's electricity.

Dont disrespect coal

I like to help those in need personally, such as filling a families tank of oil in the winter or giving back to my community through church programs.

3830 2018-09-04 16:23:55 Nice oil propaganda. Because of you the Earth is being destroyed so you can make a quick buck!
3831 2018-09-04 16:23:51 Ma'am if you are looking for something which talks about where resources used in our products come from, the book I'm reading right now, Blood Oil by Leif Wenar, seems to do a good job so far :)

3842 2018-09-04 16:22:08 Botswana doesn't deserve these incredible animals and is incapable of protecting them. Others need to step in and do it for them. We'd find a way if it were drugs or oil. This happened close to a "protected" wildlife sanctuary and went undiscovered for weeks.

3894 2018-09-04 16:17:59 Well the problem is the beginning. All of this begins with the notion that we need to expand oil and gas. I think I adhere very closely to fact based arguments.

3972 2018-09-04 16:08:22 I had my earphones on while some dude in the bus today was selling a product. Immediately one song finished I heard:

"Go to the market and buy Lime Orange.
I say, use LIME ORANGE together with this oil and it will be well."

Shuuuu! Which one is lime orange again?

3975 2018-09-04 16:08:16 How much hemp do you need to grow to replace what is produced by oil? I can't imagine that is a small amount. They've already figured out that ethanol production interferes with food production. I actually don't think of it as an excuse but we can't change overnight that's balony

God bless you and your family.

3990 2018-09-04 16:06:19 Not untrue but that begs the q: where did the wealth to sustain scientific progress, basic living standards, and a highly educated population come from? If industry was wealth-draining and oil productivity was v. limited, can we say that only resources had potential value in ‘92?

3993 2018-09-04 16:06:11 This is true, however different vegans do it differently. A raw vegan or whole foods vegan wouldn’t struggle to avoid palm oil very much, if at all. Pasta, rice, potatoes, beans, bread, and fruits & vegetables should all be generally safe.

4017 2018-09-04 16:04:31 I think the hemp one is literally just like a cooking oil and only has a really small percentage of cbd in it. I'm by no means an expert though. I've not actually even tried CBD myself. But I know a few people who bought the hemp one by accident.

4026 2018-09-04 16:03:56 The stated dealer commission is a farce and very misleading. The oil companies deduct a very hefty LFR from the so called commission. Also, in lieu of the somewhat increased commission, they have shifted a lot of the expenses to dealers, which they used to earlier pay for.

4041 2018-09-04 16:03:13 Oil has been moving higher for 3 weeks now while equities have been moving lower, some at the same valuation as $35 oil. Would hate to see what any weakness in oil will do to them, especially when you have to think we are due for some profit taking.

4101 2018-09-04 15:58:36 Do not comb wet hair rigorously. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Massage your scalp regularly. Is it NISIM or NHB? Best shampoo for hair loss. or closely related. I can't seem to detect the true URL. A great find. Really want it.
4102 2018-09-04 15:58:34 Since the 70s Scotland has brought in 10s of billions of £s in oil money and no one in Scotland saw any benefit as it all went to South East of England, Your disabled  being treated like dirt OAP's dying of cold & families using Foodbanks' " Better Together" lol gullible or what

4104 2018-09-04 15:58:26 I’d be $28 richer if I didn’t get a damn oil change this weekend

4107 2018-09-04 15:58:05 yea the govt's keep announcing plans to work around, while companies say they're not gonna be buying Iran oil.  How dumb are EU govts that they want to continue doing biz with world's largest state sponsor of terrorism?
4108 2018-09-04 15:58:04 Trying to write a joke about coconut oil as a personal lubricant, but the mom in me wants to make sure everyone knows it breaks down latex condoms. So I guess I do PSAs now. That's fun too.

4110 2018-09-04 15:57:58 I always feel so dumb getting an oil change..like don’t ask me complicated questions about what kind of oil or filters..all I know is my oil needs to be changed
4111 2018-09-04 15:57:57 オッケー解決した！新刊頑張って
4112 2018-09-04 15:57:39 200？！？？！！！
すごいですね～
4113 2018-09-04 15:57:35 If you follow me you should know that I share the same view, unfortunately oil upside is capped for the time being. Like I said, long term fundamentals are bullish,  but short term points to a short term top.

4115 2018-09-04 15:57:24 The pimples are probably your harmones going crazy. Try over the counter neutrogena oil free acne stress control power cream wash. Your favorite store, Target, sells it. It works and your face doesnt feel dry after using it. Stay blessed @queennaija
4116 2018-09-04 15:57:20 Don't agree with comments re coconut oil. But maybe she can apologise when he apologises for all the crap, confusing sound bites he's put out in the world

4119 2018-09-04 15:57:03 You told us Hezbollah is protecting their country Lebanon from Israel, we agreed with you, today, they are in Syria killing people like they plan to do in kaduna, i only asked you to make the connection, you started ranting about the west, does your brain need oil change?
4120 2018-09-04 15:56:56 Why government is not looking for reducing oil prices?
4121 2018-09-04 15:56:48 わーい一人で全部当てたわーーい
4122 2018-09-04 15:56:44 hi i did an adult thing this morning and got my oil changed by myself. wow i’m just so independent.
4123 2018-09-04 15:56:36 International prices increase today , that oil bought will be sold here after a month  
What is sold today are old stocks of lower prices !
Then how come till the old stocks are there people can be charged at today's international prices?

Oil companies loot us ?
Why  allowed?

4127 2018-09-04 15:56:29 Modi & Ilk had Fooled the Country  Pre 2014 by Blaming UPA for Fuel Prices, when the Crude Oil Prices were Above $120. They Continue to Fool the Country with High Fuel Prices Even when the Crude Oil Prices are Far Lower. #BahutHuiMahangaiKiMaar
4128 2018-09-04 15:56:07 Hahaha its so not omg we can live with oil with much better options actually
4129 2018-09-04 15:56:06 a few things i’ve learned during my journey of becoming a better cook:
-olive oil is a gift from god
-go easy on the chili powder
-cilantro is disgusting 

to be continued
4130 2018-09-04 15:56:02 A lot of simple routine products are super widely available like EVOO, coconut oil, tea tree oil, etc
Its awesome to see these things spread throughout such a wide variety of stores!
4131 2018-09-04 15:55:55 Great question! Sesame oil is suspect, as most nut and seed products are (aside from coconut). We suggest enjoying it sparingly. 
4132 2018-09-04 15:55:52 Yho dude that’s me I must drink castor oil hai ngeke

4135 2018-09-04 15:55:49 I need to do an oil cnange on the crv.  Do i do it myself, or do i make an appointment
4136 2018-09-04 15:55:39 You nailed it! Fuel price nothing to do with oil and forex slumps because of Trump-China trade war, Venezuela+Turkey economy collapses, souring oil prices etc etc... It's just Butternut heads removal that caused it. Eish
4137 2018-09-04 15:55:34 By the time Tories sort out trade with the EU Scotland will probably be within its framework as an indy nation and be incl in that deal 

If you think WM will jeopardise English requirements for Scots electricity to keep its lights on and oil to fire it's boilers your deluded.
4138 2018-09-04 15:55:18 Petrol hike again ?? Are you out of ur mind ? Every 5 days the petrol and diesel price has been revised no matter the crude oil price goes low or high, the petrol and diesel price keeps going up . Now due to rupee down , there is a hike again.
4139 2018-09-04 15:55:17 At 18 years it will be 3x longer than WW2.  I think major powers maintain war operations as training exercises to ensure troops are fit for combat.  Oil and USD probably got more to do with it. Beyond fucked up.
4140 2018-09-04 15:55:15 I wanna wash oil off animals with dish soap so bad.
4141 2018-09-04 15:55:08 No! Absolutely NO! Alberta doesn’t extract enough oil to justify another refinery or even an upgraded. Right now it ships depending on what the market is asking for. That’s what Alberta can handle, build a pipeline or two and the corporations might add another upgrader...
4142 2018-09-04 15:55:07 Every body blames the government for high oil prices.We should understand that this is no normal situation.Sanctions are in place against import of oil from Iran.This has caused prices to go up in the international market.We should bear with the government.
4143 2018-09-04 15:55:04 I love peppermint oil! But definitely not fun when you get it in your eyes. (MIGHT be speaking from experience from trying to use peppermint oil for a headache...)
4144 2018-09-04 15:54:54 harus bgt pake yg biore itu? kalo oil yg bayi itu gimanaa?
4145 2018-09-04 15:54:50 We are too! Helping these animals gives us a great sense of purpose. Next steps are educating the public on the use of palm oil and destruction it causes to their habitats.
4146 2018-09-04 15:54:49 なるほど
4147 2018-09-04 15:54:44 Aiseymannnn sorry sis, i blur malam2 mcm ni. Hm actually its healthy but the taste would be diff and you will unhappy and unhappy not good for our heart so my conclusion better using normal oil and start exercise 
4148 2018-09-04 15:54:43 Obviously there may be events that change the outlook. If China has a financial meltdown one has to close all longs in oil and go limit short. And so on. But with what we have in front of us now oil points higher.
4149 2018-09-04 15:54:43 @ManishTewari You spoke of public protests against increasing oil prices...Where r the protests? We hardly hear abt them. Even if there are such protests atleast public at large is unaware of the same. Congress needs to pull up its socks and force govt. to reduce the oil prices!!
4150 2018-09-04 15:54:33 Too bad you never had a real job after that and spent the rest of your life living off the public purse and oil company contributions.

4163 2018-09-04 15:53:46 so whats the alternative then Matt or don't we need to grow rape in the UK and we can just import more veg oil from abroad? Maybe switch to palm oil?
4164 2018-09-04 15:53:33 How would they get it here? Or better yet/ what/where was the oil tanker supposed to take it?
4165 2018-09-04 15:53:31 Yung oil kasi HAHA pero sobrang napapatigil ako paghinga whenever may nagstunt tapos madudulas huhuhu is everyone sa Club okay?
4166 2018-09-04 15:53:26 For sure oil is a volatile market. And there are plenty of people out there that make a ton of money just trading short term swings without any medium/long term view. We may see some crazy ups and downs but long term the supply and demand equation point to higher prices.

4178 2018-09-04 15:52:26 Also palm oil is showing up in more and more things so saying you can’t eat it is now making your selection of food less and less.
4179 2018-09-04 15:52:25 Tea tree oil, for real.. dip a q-tip in it and twist it around in your ears and it'll make them quit hurting and will help your throat too.

4233 2018-09-04 15:47:53 Stop blamming each other party, why can't center and state govt sit to decide to include GST reduce VAT over oil. Though election is ahead so they started blaming each other like child fighting for chocklet #FuelPriceRise @otv
4234 2018-09-04 15:47:53 Considering bracket of 80-95 $/Barrel as normal international crude oil prices, current price of around 75 $/Barrel is obviously at lower side. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, average annual price of crude was above 105 $/Barrel which is certainly high.
4235 2018-09-04 15:47:50 @TheBubbleBubble do you have any opinion regarding shale oil & shale gas at Vaca Muerta?
4236 2018-09-04 15:47:40 Doesn’t include him at its core and he is publicly SKEWERED for it ... how can any of the rest of us hope to fight for any real change outside of the need and greed for oil and xenophobia? Home soil ideology change is what we desperately need. Not more militaristic devastation
4237 2018-09-04 15:47:39 All the arguments the SNP use for Indy equality apply to Shetland. Will  SNP allow Shetland to leave an Indy Scotland.....how wealthy would Shetland be when the take what would be their oil gas and fishing away from Scotland?????
4238 2018-09-04 15:47:35 Strange the Treasury doesn't get much in tax payments from Scotland's oil. I think they're writing this off rather than show the country's true wealth. Would encourage greater support for Independence.

4250 2018-09-04 15:46:19 And by the way. Future price expectations do get factored in over a long period of time. Oil was in the mid 50s in the middle of 2017 and now we are at 70. The trend has been higher for a while.
4251 2018-09-04 15:46:12 That's for sure sir. I learned that from a Deacon that goes to church saying the same catchphrase, "Oil and water don't mix".
4252 2018-09-04 15:46:08 Have you tried Oil of Oregano?? Works a charm for me.
4253 2018-09-04 15:46:04 Honey & Olive oil could not fit into any other than empty Alcohol labelled bottles! I m really surprised that Sharjeel & co couldn't come up with any other justification than this.  They decided to Ridicule themselves rather than accepting culpability

4259 2018-09-04 15:44:59 High THC protocol, you can add as much CBD as you like on top of that. But adding frankincense, myrrh, and hops extracts to eating the oil, using it in suppositories, topically and by vaping/fumigation, will probably have a more desirable effect.

4261 2018-09-04 15:44:55 I am assuming production continues to grow in the US. Read carefully what I wrote. I will still not be enough. And lo and behold if the growth in US production disappoints. If that happens fasten your seat belt as we will start a race higher in oil.
4262 2018-09-04 15:44:40 Even with a high oil bond debt of Rs. 2,10,000/- crore the price of petrol under congress went up from Rs. 40 a litre to Rs. 83 a litre in 10 years, how much has it increased in last 4 years?
4263 2018-09-04 15:44:39 American carnage, Trump style.  He has no plan, he has no empathy for people like Knox County. He bragged about his rich friends tax cut. He is the snake oil salesman who comes to town promising the moon and then goes, leaving folks still dying.
4264 2018-09-04 15:44:30 If having oil is justification for not building solar capacity, then should all countries that have oil drop solar power generation from their portfolio?

4270 2018-09-04 15:43:53 Is leakage typically easier to facilitate via imported coal or domestically produced gas? Of note is that this is the first substantial coal-fired project in Egypt, a country that has an abundance of oil/gas but not coal.

4272 2018-09-04 15:43:47 International Crude oil was more than 120 dollar in 2013 and in india petrol was 85 Rs. 
Now the Crude oil is 70 dollar and petrol in india is 86 Rs. Why this much tax is collected?

4276 2018-09-04 15:43:16 The govt keeps boasting about high tax revenues being generated but does it care about the inflationary situation that it is creating in our country?

-enough bees wax to make ¾ cup total lip balm mixture 
-several drops essential oil, for flavor

Put the mixture in a small container or a lipbalm container. Chill in the refrigerator for about 15 min.

4301 2018-09-04 15:40:55 Fracking for oil might be helpful economically, but environmentally it's awful. So like, save money I guess, but if we keep doing it, we're not going to have a suitable country to use said money on.

4313 2018-09-04 15:40:04 I have, Norway produces about twice as much oil at half the price because its easier to extract, investment in Scotland is higher than any other country in the UK, we give £60bn to the treasury but yet it costs over £73bn to run Scotland, now you're just making accusations.

4327 2018-09-04 15:38:39 Look who's talking about clueless. Ya Kenney, we're on track with the provincial deficit because the price of oil has been high, above $70. That means more revenue for the province. Building TMX, noting to do with AB. finances. Not till it's build.

4329 2018-09-04 15:38:26 Leaving your insults aside, what you say is factually incorrect. SDF controls about 25% of Syria which consists of some of its oil fields, insufficient to create a state entity and almost zero of fertile land-that is in the West and center of the country..
4330 2018-09-04 15:38:23 I'd not heard of funnel cakes before, but yes! Get manufacturers of peristaltic pumps and stirrer hotplates to sponsor as you pump in the batter to a stirred hot corn oil bath. Also a powder funnel for the icing sugar.

4369 2018-09-04 15:35:24 Nobody is stopping it. But, realize it's not very impactful to the environment. Electricity is produced by coal, oil, and natural gas; some with nuclear power. Big trucks impact air quality the most. Alter them to run on Natural Gas. Much cleaner.

4372 2018-09-04 15:35:07 I also disagree there. The depletion in the shale production is showing signs of just becoming too big. And my math assumes a growth of 1.8m bpd in 18 and 2m in 20 for US production. If we get lower than that then get ready for oil to touch 100.

4384 2018-09-04 15:33:51 Now that Pakistan has been denied the $300 in USA military support, my guess is, they will now take funds from China, oil from Iran, and military hardware from Russia.

I'm not quite sure how this decision helps.

4421 2018-09-04 15:30:30 I agree. @bonifacemwangi is fond of attacking without a clear picture of what is supposed to be done now that we are in a quandary over the high oil prices which has lowered consumer purchasing power

4443 2018-09-04 15:28:39 It’s disappointing, I think the oil was old because it didn’t smell like it used to. *gives me an excuse to buy new*

Fixed!
4451 2018-09-04 15:27:46 I just dropped my ENTIRE bottle of expensive face oil all over my bathroom floor. This is really how today is gonna go, huh?
4452 2018-09-04 15:27:39 You just need an oil change, this is what we need so there isn't any breakdown in the resistance.
4453 2018-09-04 15:27:22 Bit less interested in confidence, more concerned about her health.... her oil pump will be working overtime  hauling that mass about. That’s the sad truth, maybe if she’s gets rich afterwards she will have time to go too the gym. That will be a good thing.

4461 2018-09-04 15:26:40 Personally I think it was to do with the oil???
4462 2018-09-04 15:26:32 Tom Steyer and George Soros come to mind. Steyer made his money in oil, but now its evil. Soros is just bad he broke whole countries. But yeah its the bad repubs.

4468 2018-09-04 15:26:06 Absolutely it is. Canadians of all political persuasions have been duped by these charlatans for a long time now. It is the insidiousness of US & foreign "Big Oil" to reduce our competitiveness & the greed of professional protestors who undermine our O&G industry.
4469 2018-09-04 15:26:06 All these years Modi govt was lucky enough to see cheap crude oil prices.
It could have used this opportunity to reduce India's oil dependence by creating buffer reserve or invest in new technologies but it didn't.

Now the whole country has to suffer Modi's failure

4501 2018-09-04 15:23:30 Sure. And they did build some of the oil and gas infrastructure that was later used to make the oligarchs rich (though the oligarchs would have gotten rich even without that infrastructure).
4502 2018-09-04 15:23:13 @IcelandFoods - your plant based range of sausages, burgers and chicken-style strips are very tasty. Your commitment to plant based food and palm oil free products is truly inspiring in helping the environment through our food choices. Thank you!

4504 2018-09-04 15:22:40 When 1 litre petrol = ₹77, $1 is ₹70.

When 1 litre petrol = ₹78, $1 is ₹71.

Basically, the Dollar is chasing Oil. Coz, it’s American.
4505 2018-09-04 15:22:35 This is underreported by design. Our current government believes that Canadian oil is evil. What’s wrong with a little help from foreigners pushing the party line?

4512 2018-09-04 15:21:59 Did you know ?

It takes approximately 50 rose flowers to create just a single drop of Rose oil! Because they are so concentrated, essential oils are precious. Even used sparingly, they can offer immense therapeutic benefit.

4514 2018-09-04 15:21:51 The fish is surprisingly good. Fresh and the flesh wasn’t dry. Batter flavourful and not too thick. Chips on the other hand, literally dipped in oil. Price wise, nope.
4515 2018-09-04 15:21:50 If you're open to foreign investment (as Russia was in the 90s), you can actually just promise foreign companies a cut of the oil profits in exchange for building your extraction infrastructure! And I believe Russia has done a bit of this.

4523 2018-09-04 15:21:03 I am pro pipeline, live in Ontario and also lived in Van for 4 years long ago. I have to admit to being nervous about high volume of oil and tanker traffic in English Bay/Burrard Inlet .. how the hell didn't Energy East and Nrthn Gateway fly? Ridiculous that TMX is a go vs them
4524 2018-09-04 15:20:54 I've never used an actual skin care oil, but I use beard shampoo, oil, and balm daily.

4528 2018-09-04 15:20:23 Before the price crash  and indyref  the oil revenue was 5billion. In 2017 it was £208m and year before £56m.  There is next to nothing tax revenue and Scotland has been running a high deficit of 13B. You do the maths.

4580 2018-09-04 15:15:40 You are factually wrong mam. Home loans interest has increased in last 2-3 yrs. Thing is when international price of crude oil were down, BJP didn't gv relief to common man and used the money on social schemes. And now wen the price is uncontrollable govt hs no options left.

4591 2018-09-04 15:14:39 If every car in Norway was an electric, total consumption would be around 5TWh. Our total production is around 145TWh. Refining oil takes about the same amount of electricity (about 6kwh/gallon), so really no big difference.

4603 2018-09-04 15:13:41 The Nazis finally get to build that Berlin-Baghdad railway for real. Oil transforms their warmaking abilities.

4614 2018-09-04 15:12:51 I guess you disagree manmade climate change is happening? Because that's a science dictating what's happening in the environment, and it will require a scientific solution.

4624 2018-09-04 15:11:43 Didn't they create a superpowers worth of wealth out of a peasant backward state? Not sure I follow the 'it's all oil and gas' part. West has consistently underestimated Russian or soviet tech.
4625 2018-09-04 15:11:40 Hoskins, yes.  Nola, of course, but I'm talking more about every day players.  Quinn, too small of a sample size.

4627 2018-09-04 15:11:37 But you do not exploit oil or nickel with shovels. To be able to exploit them, you have to invest billions in plant & equipment. And that's exactly what was done in the Soviet time.

4631 2018-09-04 15:11:19 the point is NOT that the Soviet system was great at producing wealth because it wasn’t. the point is that soviet exploitation of oil, gas, diamonds, nickel, etc came at catastrophic human cost & today most people don’t benefit from it

4652 2018-09-04 15:09:57 She has a dad in her life, I just think Kait was always babied & never heard the word no. She was very pushy to get her way, almost like she was throwing a fit.

 yea no, she is very passive aggressive. Plus she doesn’t know how to properly use essential oil.
4653 2018-09-04 15:09:51 This pipeline was conceived because Obama killed the Keystone. It was a last ditch effort get get to oil out, now they're out of options. The irony if Trump now could get Keystone fired up again.
4654 2018-09-04 15:09:32 I should have just been selfish with my oil
4655 2018-09-04 15:09:23 Evidence of the global oil industry destruction is so abundant, a google search will bring up 1000s of pages. That brand new pipe Standing Rock fought, are you not aware of that leak or any of the near daily spills all over the continent? & yes-keep that bitumen in the ground.
4656 2018-09-04 15:09:22 NAFTA talks resume today. Canada needs to dump supply management in dairy, not as a concession but because it is anachronistic to modern free trade principles. Any guarantee of access to Canadian oil supply to US must go too BUT Chapter 19 is a MUST TO STAY. #cdnpoli
4657 2018-09-04 15:09:22 Don’t rinse your contacts in jalapeño oil. Google says I’m probably going blind. See you guys later, but probably not.

4659 2018-09-04 15:09:10 I have not articulated my position clearly. I got off track with political BS. If that was your family, my family, or anyone’s family in the initial tweet, it would be totally unacceptable.  If you are OK with such nonsense, we can agree to disagree - civilly

4663 2018-09-04 15:08:37 See "Killers of the Flower Moon" for details as to why whites also wanted to get on Indian rolls (oil, other royalties). It is also the case, as I understand it, that Cherokees intermarried with whites more than any other tribe, "reason" why this is often the (fake) claimed tribe

4665 2018-09-04 15:08:34 We import total of 80% of our oil requirements, which is why govt is pushing for electric vehicles and giving subsidies of 20%.. So that lesser we r dependent on oil lesser outflow of forex reserves which will help rupee..

4668 2018-09-04 15:08:08 Petrol and diesel prices have set a new record, pushed by a combination of the dramatic fall in rupee and a sharp rise in crude oil, resurrecting the demand for lowering of duties on the fuel.

4673 2018-09-04 15:07:38 In conclusion. Literally almost all Oils have the same calorie level. However olive oil is rich in cholesterol lowering mono saturated fats. I hope this helps.

4696 2018-09-04 15:06:00 If @united had let us switch flights without a $2000 fee to last night’s flight with OPEN seats, maybe we wouldn’t have been stuck since 4:30 a.m. because of an oil leak.

4700 2018-09-04 15:05:45 If the US really wants India to stop importing oil/gas from Iran, surely it should offer cheaper alternatives? the US now has 2 LNG export facilities.

4751 2018-09-04 15:01:34 If petrol is brought under GST, it may cost as little as Rs 38.10 in Delhi at 12 per cent GST rate.According to data released by the Indian Oil Corporation for the petrol price build up in Delhi, the fuel costs only Rs 26.65 at the refineries. Will State Govt ready for this ?
4752 2018-09-04 15:01:30 Of course I won't. It would entirely ruin my experiment to pour vegetable oil on the skin samples instead of acid. What do you take me for, John?
4753 2018-09-04 15:01:24 I don’t know if the offer to OWTU is genuine. I don’t know if OWTU has the capacity to manage an oil refinery given its structure. But I feel like we need to find a way to retain public interest in the refinery. A PPP might allow for that.

4773 2018-09-04 14:59:05 I was also, but as long as you do that in a deep pot with only as much oil as you need, in small batches at a really high temp... it's alright.  Very satisfying and if the oil's hot enough, doesn't get too soggy.

4788 2018-09-04 14:58:15 1st, even by the acceptance of the govt currently in power, the claim about oil income under Buhari in that pictograph is false.

4792 2018-09-04 14:58:10 Beautiful simple paintings (oil on canvas) by Patrick Larcebal, artiste peintre. What strikes you about them? :)
4793 2018-09-04 14:58:04 M&S are TERRIBLE for unnecessary packaging!! Their avocados may as well be dipped in crude oil, encased in plastic then finally swathed in the fur of the most endangered animal they can find. I MAY be exaggerating.
4794 2018-09-04 14:57:56 he deadass will be like “babe wake up i miss you” and then be like “okay i’m gonna go do my oil change and check the deer cameras” liKE WHY
4795 2018-09-04 14:57:54 A bit surprised crude was so much higher this morning--when refining operations are curtailed --crude not being used --Iran cut deal with India on oil sales and Iranian Pres states oil sales will continue --meaning much going to China #OOTT
4796 2018-09-04 14:57:53 I don’t wanna be rich, I just wanna be wealthy enough to get my oil changed on time.
4797 2018-09-04 14:57:50 But not the fact they use palm oil?
4798 2018-09-04 14:57:45 One day I have too many bottles of soy sauce and now that I need some I have none but have like 4 bottles of sesame oil 
4799 2018-09-04 14:57:44 Yes tried the olive oil and Rapeseed.. not the avocado though ..#WillPutItOnMyShoppingList what do  you recommend using it on?.. loving the bbq & Grill frylight though! Perfect combo 
4800 2018-09-04 14:57:43 I be in the hood like I’m oil changing
4801 2018-09-04 14:57:36 And we are talking about oil right now.

4803 2018-09-04 14:57:20 Ahhhh the great smell of motor oil and money to start my day 
4804 2018-09-04 14:57:19 When you thought your plan for free oil changes was over. But the service man tells you you have one more left. 
4805 2018-09-04 14:57:15 I am sure Fatanjali and Baba Kamdev will produce some bio oil or ayurvedic swedeshi Oil ,which will replace Petrol n Diesel..to escape from price hike, Baba Jee Ka Thoolloo.#PetrolLone

4813 2018-09-04 14:56:49 I respectfully disagree. All the bombs I built during OIF and OEF had nothing to do with American civilians rights overseas. Based on my personal experience, they had everything to do with oil. I can think of 13 out of 19 reasons why.
4814 2018-09-04 14:56:46 I do not care what happened in the past...We have started talking a few weeks ago and I told you that I was bullish and that the markets will tighten into year end. That is starting to happen. Since we first spoke oil has started to move up.
4815 2018-09-04 14:56:42 I have a question. 

If same size area of forest is replaced with palm oil plantation, will the CO2 emission rate would be the same?
4816 2018-09-04 14:56:40 There's more integrity in the tip of Theresa May's smallest finger than you can ever find in Nigel Farage and his merryband of snake oil salesmen. Brexit is evidence that you're just a bunch of conmen. You sold an item which you don't have and can't deliver.
4817 2018-09-04 14:56:31 Thankfully for me I get my reaction images from the source instead of stealing them from Twitter users who stole them from other Twitter users who stole them from... etc. And twitter compresses the image a hundred times until it looks like a poorly rendered oil painting

4819 2018-09-04 14:56:09 @realDonaldTrump The exemption from our oil and bank sanctions is our red line, and we will never tolerate it. Exemptions should be removed from the sanctions system, which means that a bank can not deal with Iran, which means that Iran's oil exports should be completely cut off
4820 2018-09-04 14:56:08 shame on them, where are MOAMAR GADDAFI days?, the best leader of Libya since history, militias are trying to control funds and oil, no patriotism at all, are conflict parties were prisoners in gaddafi jails

4823 2018-09-04 14:55:58 More than 90% of the $4.6 billion decline in federal tax revenue for 2016 came from Alberta. What do you think is the cause? Recession in the oil industry or are people changing their behaviour to minimize tax?
4824 2018-09-04 14:55:51 Oh the horror! Increasing the production tax (for evil oil overlords)! #sarcasm #oklaed #okleg #oklahoma #oklahomaproblems #brokelahoma

4831 2018-09-04 14:55:23 Creating oil extraction infrastructure isn't nothing (though they did it really inefficiently). But most of the wealth stolen by the oligarchs was in the ground...
4832 2018-09-04 14:55:16 and where is it now? I know I have been bearish oil but natgas was also helped by the very long winter.  Bulls better keep praying for another long winter. Btw, do you also remember when I was bearish on the global economy back in January? Even bears were jumping ship.  Not me.

4847 2018-09-04 14:53:35 Funny really: this part of the country is stuffed full of retired oil executives. You would have thought they would welcome the smell of frack chems in the morning while walking the labrador.
4848 2018-09-04 14:53:33 "I don't need an appointment it's an oil change. They got a bunch of idiots back there"

4853 2018-09-04 14:53:07 No, obviously. Also wondering why Norway's oil consumption continues to climb despite every country around it lowering their consumption. Aren't oil exports about 25% of Norway's economy?

4934 2018-09-04 14:44:49 High crude prices and depreciating currency in some import markets such as India and Indonesia, leading to high consumer prices, if sustained, will at some point hurt short term oil demand, particularly for diesel. Income affect likely to prevail for gasoline
4935 2018-09-04 14:44:48 Isn’t that what Gadaffi was planning when the West went into “save” Libya #blackgold #oil #slavery
4936 2018-09-04 14:44:47 Nice article. What is working for the seizures?  CBD oil? 
Curcumin-Oregano-etc. All anti fungal AF

4939 2018-09-04 14:44:36 @narendramodi AUTOMATIC SAVING ON OIL WITHOUT REDUCING PRICE ?!? YES POSSIBLE. 5 DAYS WEEK FOR ALL, school,college,offices public or private. I AM SURE, YOU WILL DARE TO DO IT. YOU CAN DO IT.
4940 2018-09-04 14:44:29 Put some of ur party's time on taking care of Bengal, rather making  music on Oil
4941 2018-09-04 14:44:22 i got one of those bathroom trays for my cologne and beard oil and i feel adult-y like a muhfucka in the mornings
4942 2018-09-04 14:44:00 Aww, thank you Kate! I've been getting back into traditional art too (acrylics and pencil mostly) and I'm actually spending some time writing to feed my creative muscle a bit; Noncommittal side projects are a life saver.

Your oil paintings look rad btw, I'm reeeeal jealous.
4943 2018-09-04 14:44:00 For gazpacho, combine all of this in a blender: mostly cucumber (peeled), mostly tomato (can also be peeled,) some red bell pepper, some onion, olive oil, salt, pepper or seasoning, lil vinegar, garlic is optional.
4944 2018-09-04 14:43:45 Because there's demand for it. Refineries all over the Gulf coast are set up to refine Venezuelan heavy blends no longer available. It's cheaper to find a new source if possible than to refit. "Big oil" is a reference to major US producers. They don't buy oil, they sell it.

4949 2018-09-04 14:43:15 So, I just learned that aceite rosa mosqueta and rosehip oil are the same thing? My parents have been slathering that on their faces (as well as me and my siblings') for as long as I can remember. We're so hip now.

4956 2018-09-04 14:42:24 Deary me, Scotland's Oil & Gas revs in UK are reserved to Westminster who decreased the tax rate charged to oil & gas Co.s for extraction.The UK Gov. pays oil companies to extract oil – rather than getting paid . For an iScotland, dont look at UK look at Norway!

4958 2018-09-04 14:42:14 OK Carl two questions for you
1) Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil and gas revenues or the 8% we get now?,yes its 8%
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?

4960 2018-09-04 14:42:07 All these years Modi govt was lucky enough to see cheap crude oil prices.
It could have used this opportunity to reduce India's oil dependence by creating buffer reserve or invest in new technologies but it didn't.

Now the whole country has to suffer Modi's failure.

4963 2018-09-04 14:41:57 I haven’t evolved to oil moisturising yet but holy hell am I oil cleansing’s BITCH 
4964 2018-09-04 14:41:55 @realDonaldTrump I do not have to come and say every day that there are no exemptions for oil and bank sanctions, but make it clear that there are no sanctions on oil and banking. That is so hard for the Treasury Department and the State Department

4968 2018-09-04 14:41:36 I emailed them to ask for feedback though so hopefully they will tell me why rather than giving me some crap lie. Cause i can't have done too badly if i managed to sell, 2 bubble bars, a bath bomb, a bath oil, a massage bar and a cleanser in an hour.

4978 2018-09-04 14:41:00 How to remove oil from a driveway: Cover with sand let stand for a few days, then sweep off.
4979 2018-09-04 14:40:57 Refinery supply is a zero-sum game. A refinery that is supplied by pipeline does not need to be supplied by oil-by-rail. Besides safety, oil-by-rail is more expensive and generates more GHG per barrel than pipelines
4980 2018-09-04 14:40:52 Not bringing out a white paper on economy immediately after assuming office is a monumental miscalculation by NaMo. Had he done it the Govt wouldn't have to be embarrassed with economic fugitives, skyrocketing of oil prices etc.

4991 2018-09-04 14:39:53 Taking Alqaeda was an assignment from the US, for the oil in #DeirEzZor, its just about the oil there, not the two parties they created or promoted! 
and #PKK=#YPG is proven
Apart from that, Hitler had an anti-smoking campagne! Following your logic would make Hitler an angel 
4992 2018-09-04 14:39:42 @SaraEisen Lets not forget the US imports 17.5% of their daily oil consumption from Canada
4993 2018-09-04 14:39:37 Absolutely. They're criss crossing WV with unseemly gas pipelines Fracking around Wheeling.

4994 2018-09-04 14:39:33 @saltylance in this upcoming election I would feature two lovers making out on a park bench, one holding a sign saying "big oil/wall street" another holding a sign saying "Washington Republicans" then a voice over says, "there's a reason their policies just don't work for you..."
4995 2018-09-04 14:39:24 Who made the 'Coconut oil is poison' go viral? Lecture in German language does not naturally gain English-language international headlines unless someone pushing hard. I'm thinking maybe vegetable oil industry taking aim at foreign competition? Anyone have info on this?
4996 2018-09-04 14:39:16 You have probably been round the houses Howard, but have you tried CBD oil? Great results for some people.

5007 2018-09-04 14:38:20 Here, the businesses that had been the economic engine of this most prosperous Black community in the U.S. are identified.

5033 2018-09-04 14:35:30 Today perfect example of the US Treasury ESF  manipulating Au Ag & oil prices probably in collusion  with Fed/banks. The difference is when you artificially hold down the price of oil demand grows. There are no free markets in US only HFT, collusion & deep capture #PriceDiscovery
5034 2018-09-04 14:35:13 Fuel prices are rising because increase in Crude Oil, which have touched 72$ barrel and weakening of rupee, hitting its all time low against dollar. All these factors are driven by global markets. Indian Government can’t do much about it as we are importer of oil.

5049 2018-09-04 14:34:05 Irrelevant question since India's petroleum needs are significantly dependent on importing crude oil from OPEC and other countries to sufficiently feed the domestic needs which inter alia include refining in the domestic refineries

5054 2018-09-04 14:33:16 Oh no im so sorry :( have you tried warm oil and tea for your ears? D: at least an old house medicine trick to keep it at bay a little?
5055 2018-09-04 14:33:16 Bro if we Somalis want what belong to us legally then we should unite and fight for it, or atleast make the oil impossible to be extract from erea, involve big powers into the deal like Russia USA China Germany Japan and the UN,

5065 2018-09-04 14:31:45 Oil continues to be transported by rail and road and is significantly more dangerous than a pipeline which can be closely monitored, controlled and hazard spills curtailed.

5070 2018-09-04 14:31:15 Lanjutin rekwes partner Rusia gw yg minta Outlook tadi pagi, gw tanya dia balik, “What are the odds Mr. Putin doing something crazy and oil goes to 90?” 

Jawabnya, “Dude, we’re Russians.”

5073 2018-09-04 14:30:47 I call on all of the Democratic senators present to take shots of Castor oil and synchronized  on cue- all over Grassly.  #WalkOut

5077 2018-09-04 14:30:06 @INFINITIUSA why mandate synthetic oil changes and 5K mile oil change intervals? It's incredibly wasteful and environmentally irresponsible to change synthetic oil so frequently
5078 2018-09-04 14:30:03 I'm not misinformed. You're being blinded. I shared the information.  Many people are using cannabis oil right now to shrink their tumors. People not mice. You aren't reading my responses. I'm done with you. Enjoy your poison therapies.
5079 2018-09-04 14:29:56 Jun, have you plotted the inflation rates of neighbors ID, MY, TH, VN, KR, HK, etc with WTI oil prices? If so, similar trend as PH? thanks.
5080 2018-09-04 14:29:54 Did Zardari and Sharjeel Memon troll the Chief Justice by placing Honey and Olive Oil in his room because they knew he had his spies reporting on Sharjeel Memon.??  

I can't help but wonder.
5081 2018-09-04 14:29:50 I put olive oil in my hair the other night and it’s still super soft and moisturized.
5082 2018-09-04 14:29:49 På samme måte som Trump har sin "clean coal" har Norge sin "clean oil". Det er visst den reneste som finnes. I alle fall i følge Schjøtt Pedersen
5083 2018-09-04 14:29:49  correct we are exporter and getting more profit if $ rate increased and loss when $ rate reduced . Export is must to fulfill our oil and other necessary imports to earn USD for country
5084 2018-09-04 14:29:47 We certainly understand the importance of sourcing our natural raw materials in a socially & environmentally responsible way. Our commitment is that by 2025 all Palm Oil within our Supply Chain will be sustainably sourced through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. ~Leslie
5085 2018-09-04 14:29:47 Hahaha yes we import Empty Bottles and fill with Honey, Olive Oil, 
5086 2018-09-04 14:29:41 Are we really going to pretend that there is anything else anyone wants to talk to her about?  TF does she think anybody wants to know?  How she uses peanut oil instead of vegetable oil to cook?  How she trained her dog to understand commands in German?  Gtfoh lol
5087 2018-09-04 14:29:38 Spry Ave: 6 Engine has made entry reporting no smoke and a smell of oil. Situation UC, all backup is being returned.
5088 2018-09-04 14:29:35 Bitch just want just enough to buy some damn Eye Lashes and that funky ass oil at the beauty supply store...
5089 2018-09-04 14:29:34 Burnt the shit out of my dominant hand with 500+ degree oil. 10/10 would recommmend
5090 2018-09-04 14:29:30 @hariun0603 리운님 라테일 들가시게 되면 제가 빌려준 패션 템들 우편으로 돌려 주세용~
5091 2018-09-04 14:29:30 don’t let ur mechanic pressure you into stuff like my mechanic tried to tell me to change my oil but I think my oil should just be itself
5092 2018-09-04 14:29:23 My wallet says no to that, but my oil and eldritch heart agrees. Plus now I'm all apologetic, because YES YOU REQUIRE THESE, WHO KEPT THESE SECRETS FROM YOU
5093 2018-09-04 14:29:04 Cus there’s a lot of fucking oil, the the government Don’t want ppl stealing it
5094 2018-09-04 14:29:02 How about because its the right thing to do and the R's are fucking snake oil scum...
5095 2018-09-04 14:28:59 I've been thinking about Half-Pariah. How would a Steam-Diesel Hybrid work? Steam pistons with a motor working the drive axel at the same time? Or would it be a glorified oil burning engine?
5096 2018-09-04 14:28:35 Maestro Buenos días, que opinión le merece el OIL?
5097 2018-09-04 14:28:33 You forgot to mention that occupying forces would steal American oil and dig for American artifags...
5098 2018-09-04 14:28:33 My car has had a light on that says oil change required for like 4 weeks now 
5099 2018-09-04 14:28:20 initial argument put to the UN was humanitarian, and their own house debates bears that out too. I don't doubt that more of that lovely oil played a part as well, but their arguments were enough to persuade others at the UN, and under the law, that's all that matters. 2/2.
5100 2018-09-04 14:28:17 Yeeep that’s my poooint sa oil price hike, if the jeepney drivers are asking for higher fare then, same goes sa mga products. Medyo na “highlight” ko lang sa jeep kase that’s one of the fresh issues about the effect of oil price.
5101 2018-09-04 14:28:16 The oil industry lost
5102 2018-09-04 14:28:11 Not at all....the government has moved from an oil economy to multi economy....agriculture, solid minerals, agriculture etc
5103 2018-09-04 14:28:10 Gigih nya la seorang aida sekarang, blow dry rambut, letak argan oil 
5104 2018-09-04 14:28:06 Reminds me of that time I dropped truffle oil on my pleated chinos. Upper middle class indeed
5105 2018-09-04 14:28:05 Oh did they announce the merch already or just the same as the one in korea con?
5106 2018-09-04 14:27:38 Seems we have left snake oil salesmen behind only to see them come back as a whole industry.

Take the same make-believe crap, make it 100x bigger and it now carries weight beyond its empty track record because it has a PR budget and institutional support.
5107 2018-09-04 14:27:30 Republicans doing something that 70% of Americans are against is par for the course. Don't know when @GOP supporters are going to realize that their Republican reps & senators don't work for them, but for the Kochs, the Waltons, big oil etc.
5108 2018-09-04 14:27:22 yeh jumale baaz PM bataye ki raincoat pehan kar kon naha raha hai
PM to nanga ho gaya sabke saamane 40rs.ltr ka oil 86rs mein bech raha hai 11lac cr. ki loot thodi hoti hai kya
Jo doosaro ko gaaliya deta hai woh ek din khud bhi sabse jyada gaali khata hai.#BahutHuiMahangaiKiMaar
5109 2018-09-04 14:27:20 Do you know how much dept PMB has incurred in the past 3years with little to show for it? Not to talk of the 100's of billions of dollars from crude oil sales. 

APC is worse than PDP!!
5110 2018-09-04 14:27:06 ออยทำได้อยู่แล้วว
5111 2018-09-04 14:26:53 Yep, but I think you should go there before noon or the queue may be too long.

5113 2018-09-04 14:26:38 รู้สึกขกไปหมด
5114 2018-09-04 14:26:21 Yep....always had that effect on me! Luckily crude oil takes no notice
5115 2018-09-04 14:26:12 The oil companies HPCl, BPCL , and IOC were absorbing the losses. Diesel and petrol were subsidised. The best way is for central govt to reduce excise and state government to reduce vat. our fiscal deficit has come down from 6% during UPA to about 3.5% now
5116 2018-09-04 14:26:11 I got to 1/2 conferences a month within oil & gas and I've tried to cut it down but I actually really want to go to the @esportsinsider_ event in September. Anyone else going?

5120 2018-09-04 14:25:44 If you blinked, you missed it, but this morning saw Diesel Futures (ULSD) reach their highest number since Black Friday 2014 (November 28). Diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil will be the most expensive petroleum molecules from now through 2019.
5121 2018-09-04 14:25:19 Try cbd oil and/or melatonin if you haven't already. Might help.
5122 2018-09-04 14:25:13 Catch the replay. Go watch an oil field fire in slow motion
5123 2018-09-04 14:25:04 Had a banging full body oil sports massage. Best thing thats happened to my body. My body is in bits tho and I had tears in my eyes lol.
5124 2018-09-04 14:25:03 Hey, we do have 2 stores at Bengaluru located at VR Mall & Mantri Square Mall. You can find the Nykaa Naturals Tea Tree Essential Oil in our stores.
5125 2018-09-04 14:24:50 Even if we "liberated" Syria, the fallout could've led to Russia, China, and a handful of other countries having enough political leverage to pull off something similar to the 1973 oil embargo.
5126 2018-09-04 14:24:49 Last week ford fixed an oil leak, yesterday we went and bought 2 new tires and they told us we had a bad oil leak. We couldn’t  figure out why we were smelling gas while we were driving. Now I have to waste my time to get the problem fixed properly.
5127 2018-09-04 14:24:39 The foolish virgins start with oil their lamps since they’re running out around midnight. The question is, why don’t they bring enough oil to last until He comes?

5129 2018-09-04 14:24:33 Can we get coal and oil giants to support kneeling NFL players? Might be chance to decelerate the climate change. But then, I guess #MAGA folks will just spill oil in their backyards to own the libs...
5130 2018-09-04 14:24:13 Already NDA collected & 10 lakhs crore as oil excise tax. Still they could not repay the debt?
5131 2018-09-04 14:24:07 피아스코 해보고 싶다 흠

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE AT AN ALL TIME LOW WAGE AND SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDING THAT THESE "KOCH"-SUKKAS HAVEN'T PAID BACK THE 2.45 TRILLION IT ILLEGALLY BORROWED FOR OIL WARS
5134 2018-09-04 14:23:15 Having got everything on platter with low oil prices and a reasonable domestic demand he’s dug the economy into the ground with his pathbreaking demonetization

5138 2018-09-04 14:22:48 Better get that oil changed

5149 2018-09-04 14:21:37 When capitalism is consigned to the dustbin of history. The capitalists artificially stir-up hatred between peoples in order to maintain their profits and privileges.  In the middle-east the capitalists needed cheap oil and, in the 20th century, socialism threatened that.

5152 2018-09-04 14:21:20 I remember D199 I was the one who hauled the oil tankers he was hauling when he first came to your railway, they had the old bugger parked in a shed outside of barrow, and had me take the tankers to London where it was destined to one of the former oil rigs
5153 2018-09-04 14:21:17 Oil paintings are the best
5154 2018-09-04 14:21:02 I know what a comparison is.
You read too much Murdoch, you know the guy with all the shares in Genie Oil & Gas, the guy who benefits from Islamophobia and who practically created it.
Evil ideas spread very much like a disease; that is observable.
5155 2018-09-04 14:20:59 You want something YUMMY & easy, try cake cookies !!

5156 2018-09-04 14:20:50 Someone should set a giant barrel of oil outside the building and open the doors so the Senate GOP catches a whiff and holds an emergency hearing to suspend the Kavanaugh hearing so they can invade the sidewalk and stage an interventionist regime change war on DC.
5157 2018-09-04 14:20:44 I have, and every article I’ve read indicates human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) plus ozone depletion by (ODS)&  holocarbons

5160 2018-09-04 14:20:16 Don't you know, wheat, soybean, oil and sugar have to be everything.  You can't even buy tomato sauce without looking at a label.  Excluding those ingredients costs you extra.
5161 2018-09-04 14:20:16 Big rig gig: Transocean is buying Ocean Rig in $2.7bn deal, creating 57-floater fleet specialising in deep water drilling for oil n gas.
Consolidation to be expected at low tide in prices.
(Transocean is based in Switzerland, notable for its offshore drilling opportunities)

5166 2018-09-04 14:20:01 The weakness (or strength) of my book is that it raises the question, but I don't pretend to know the answer. The history of fracking (and of oil) is one of predictions that turn out to be dead wrong!
5167 2018-09-04 14:20:01 Thank you. Please make the RSPO sign clearer in your store. We used to not use palm oil before and produced the same sort, if not same products requiring this kind of fat, so it is possible it’s just not financially viable for businesses as palm oil is so cheap I think.
5168 2018-09-04 14:19:56 Saw Neill speak today at oil capital. Wasn’t that impressed with him but announcement should be close as he was careful not to discuss any details. #i3e

5176 2018-09-04 14:19:07 @narendramodi Sir, for the sake of common man please keep VAT and ED fixed for $60-70 and only increase the basic crude oil price which is been imported. So that there will not be abrupt rise in prices which is creating burden to public.
5177 2018-09-04 14:19:07 Nah, rinse face three times nonstop and apply oil after , works like magic

5192 2018-09-04 14:16:49 GOP has held us captive to big oil. We have fought wars for profits for big oil companies. GOP fights steps toward independence from oil even though technology is strong and building.
We have lost hundreds of thousands of lives--our own and those of other countries--for oil wars

What do you want us to do with RAF and SANRAL infrastructure money?
5347 2018-09-04 13:59:55 Have you ever considered CBD oil? I know this is a place for #sarcasm and #jokes but it’s helping a lot of people with anxiety/sleep deprivation/etc.

5349 2018-09-04 13:59:42 Difference between Nigeria and Norway.  In the case of Norway, it is the govt that has property all over the world. With Nigeria, it is individuals,  with wealth that should have belonged to their country or to the people from whose land the oil came
5350 2018-09-04 13:59:27 Creepy. In the UK my local farms grow that weird oil-seed rape aka canola. Being marketed as healthy, "quality British produce", "cold-pressed" blabla. Good for farmers, our economy, etc. Sheep/cattle farmers grow fields of it – it's on supermarket shelves pushing out olive oil.

5403 2018-09-04 13:54:20 Appreciate the sentiment, but it seems most of the absconded wealth was related to oil, minerals, and other natural resources. The added-value labor component of extraction and processing is generally far less than the value of the exploited land wealth.

5411 2018-09-04 13:53:11 @GolicAndWingo Mayonnaise is just basically eggs, oil, salt and a little bit of mustard. Miracle Whip has sugar and seasonings added to make it sweeter and more inviting to the ones pallet!
5412 2018-09-04 13:53:03 Not defending anyone here,but rise in oil prices is something one cant do much,as the international crude oil prices are rising continuously and dollar is getting strong w.r.t to all currencies.Poltical parties can blame each other,but this is a difficult situation for any govt.

5488 2018-09-04 13:45:53 Yeah, it's hard to admit we benefit greatly from exploited labor. Just like its hard to admit that all POTUS, going back decades, kiss Saudi ass for oil. We want to believe we do the right thing, but it's often only when convenient.

5520 2018-09-04 13:42:58 Explain to people with the overall cost per liter.  Oil is global commodity & per barrel price is controlled globally, explain why other countries are priced at 50% less than India.  Why are you burdening tax payers and common man so much?

5539 2018-09-04 13:41:24 He said the oil was used so the food wouldn’t stick. Butter is an oil the food wouldn’t stick using that alone anyway. The smoke point is how much heat it can take before it burns, becomes bitter and smokes. But okay.
5540 2018-09-04 13:41:20 I like how Lora rt this. All her stories are slanted to match this narrative. CNBC in the pocket of big oil! Yet she pleads on Twitter how fair and balanced she is. BS!

5543 2018-09-04 13:41:09 I do not think using oil revenues has to impact our ability to deliver other services such as health, education etc. I believe we should use a portion of oil revenues ,maybe 75%, towards rate hikes while using the rest for other projects, of course this would mean government 1/

5623 2018-09-04 13:33:11 U know so much that Oil prices have surged by OPEC but u want to stick to fooling people
5624 2018-09-04 13:33:10 Is borage oil effect in easing some of the #PMS / #PMDD symptoms. I've read about anecdotal reports, but have yet to hear from actual users who had positive, negative and/or no effect on their symptoms. Would glad to hear from people who already tried it. 
5625 2018-09-04 13:32:52 Who would win:
A) my extreme, chronic anxiety
B) one dab of lavender oil behind the ears as needed
5626 2018-09-04 13:32:41 Main problem is higher the price of oil in International market boost the profit of Govt of India. Means if we pay 10/ tax at 50/ diesel price and pay 60/ but if the price will 100/ we have to pay 20/ as tax ie 120/ per litre. @PMOIndia @BJP4India if it's not true reply me.

5631 2018-09-04 13:32:07 "I know people who only eat veg, and still ill"???? Yes, they would be. But unless they are roasting those veg in oil/butter or adding dressings and sauces, there's NO WAY they'd be obese. Plumpers always lie to themselves.

5634 2018-09-04 13:31:33 ''oddly enough, i have this fond admiration for the littlest of things, like how the leaves of an acacia tree would play hide-and-seek with sunlight or how jeepney’s crude oil would leave rainbow trails on roads when it rains.''
5635 2018-09-04 13:31:32 But, compared to British Petroleum’s efforts to plug its deep-sea oil hole, the G-20 leaders look omnipotent.
5636 2018-09-04 13:31:27 Dems will hyperventilate over every Republican nominee, and will demonize anything surrounding Trump.  Nothing new here, yet Rubin makes this sound like a completely new phenomenon.

5641 2018-09-04 13:30:56 Only about 20% of US oil production cane from HY companies during the ‘15/16 downturn.  My guess is that number not much different now. Of that 20% a big chunk higher quality (cxo, fang, etc).  The risk to oil production from rates is very small currently.

The money we pay in taxes isn't put away to cover our future lifetime costs, its used to buy votes.

5669 2018-09-04 13:28:09 I disagree....People will carry on. Oil was above 100 for many years and the world did not blow up. Oil will go higher into the end of the year.
5670 2018-09-04 13:28:07 I run a lot and walk everywhere, being in NYC. So I change sneakers like other people change oil.

5678 2018-09-04 13:27:07 Oh yes, Chidu gave oil bonds to oil cos in lieu of cash, and forgot to pay them. NDA had to pay them, hard cash. And oil cos cost shot up as they had to borrow to meet cash requirement... Yes, relevant questions right

5684 2018-09-04 13:26:29 True, PTI KP govt used to complain
1: 800MW plant on Gas was resisted by Fed govt (FG)
2: FG was resisting hydel power projects( NOCs etc).
3: FG Is not adding KP electricity in national grid.
4: FG not issuing NOC for oil & gas excavation.  
5: NHA (Swat road)
6 CRBC..
5685 2018-09-04 13:26:28 Na wa! This thing is amazing. Someone who does NGO youth work is arguing with an ex-World Bank VP about int'l finance. Reminds me of popular Nigerian who was estimating Govt take from oil production and used gross revenue as base. Totally neglected costs & IOC share of revenue.
5686 2018-09-04 13:26:27 you can also make low carb really good desserts with coconut flour, coconut oil and stevia, much healthier and taste great!

5706 2018-09-04 13:25:02 This is the core issue, selecting private transport as model for development , bad for an oil importing country but since last decade it is giving boost to GDP number everyone is ok with that.

5711 2018-09-04 13:24:35 I live in the oil province, and I got that job during a super boom in 2004. At the time minimum wage was $5.75, which wasn’t changed until around 2010 to $7. As of January it’s now $15. I was very lucky.

5721 2018-09-04 13:23:56 No, there's a slick vinaigrette made of lemon juice, olive oil & garlic in which you toss a combination of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, bell peppers, parsley & mint.
5722 2018-09-04 13:23:51 Why can't we do this with oil companies
5723 2018-09-04 13:23:50 Be it npas or oil loans etc it reflects definitely on the bad mess the previous govt left the economy in that's y many like us had urged the govt of releasing a white paper in the first month only.
5724 2018-09-04 13:23:49 You failed to get it?
5725 2018-09-04 13:23:33 Oil is needed either way. Surely it's better to get it from down the road rather than imported from the middle East. You seem to favour the more environmentally unfriendly route otherwise you would support home grown oil.

5729 2018-09-04 13:22:57 Looks like another false flag setup, Mr. President.  I would steer clear of this one if I was you. I don't care what Jared Kushner thinks on this...or his oil seeking Israeli friends either. We all know it's a false flag mission and White Helmet propaganda. We KNOW!!
5730 2018-09-04 13:22:47 It was good to be back and see lots of familiar faces.  Lucas Oil felt a little different, but cool fan experience outside of the heat.
5731 2018-09-04 13:22:44 @standforalaska Stop the oil and gas drilling. Shut down all the mines. Save the environment to hell with $$$
5732 2018-09-04 13:22:40 Only one way to put it - the economy and the ZAR is FUCKED. Nearly R20 to the pound. Not seen since 911! Oil nearly at 80USD to the barrel. Technical recession etc etc. Lots of hardship coming to all SA’ns I’m afraid.
5733 2018-09-04 13:22:39 I have finally, after like 10 years, figured out how to actually moisturize my very dry, low porosity hair. Oil treatment + heating cap FTW.

5735 2018-09-04 13:22:36 We have emission-reducing technology, it's called renewable energy. We're putting more money into subsidizing oil & gas than into renewables. That's what's really stupid.

5742 2018-09-04 13:22:10 1) #Oil above $70 a barrel.  Astoria pegged #commodities as the 2nd most important theme in our 2018 outlook.  Why? 1) lower correlation to stocks & bonds 2) positive skewness (stocks exhibit negative skewness) 3) sensitive to inflation 4) positive carry
5743 2018-09-04 13:22:08 @PMOIndia Respected Sir,
The oil price is very high. It is very difficult to accept the price instead of low international price of crude oil.

She is only able to sleep at night thanks to cannibus oil.

5789 2018-09-04 13:17:42 I prefer butternut squash to pumpkin if it's in season, the taste is quite different, sweet and nuttier...hard to explain! But I'm sure it works great in any pumpkin recipe.

I like them cut into cubes and oven baked with olive oil, and added into salads

5804 2018-09-04 13:15:43 We have very low campaign contribution limits in Canada. Liberals might be able to skirt those laws, but Conservatives, who are apparently in bed with big oil ... are policed rigorously!
5805 2018-09-04 13:15:41 I'm not from Ottawa. I agree Alberta should go and take Scheer and Harper with you.  You can all dance in the oil fields wearing white KKK hats.  Become some backwater racist colony.

Granary sourdough, Chicken, bacon, S&O stuffing, cranberry. 1/2
5837 2018-09-04 13:11:29 So you are saying there will be no market for oil by rail? Is that correct? The reason being that it is more expensive than supply by pipeline.

6034 2018-09-04 12:47:37 Dear @theskinnypop 

Why can't I find original recipe popcorn anywhere? Corn, oil & salt. Can't find it.

 I could be wrong here but don't nobody want no "white cheddar" or or "salt and pepper" popcorn

pepper? PEPPER?!?!? 
6035 2018-09-04 12:47:26 Cancer has a cure big pharma knows it, it's called in Genesis 1:29. Buy a pound of Hemp extract the oil medicate yourself and consume it, it will rejuvenate the old, kill cancer cells, amongst a wide range of other diseases.

6039 2018-09-04 12:47:02 I thought you just poured fuel in those things. Changing the oil and the like is seen as cheating. 
6040 2018-09-04 12:46:48 They will give oil well but for working 
6041 2018-09-04 12:46:46 Teresa, excellent decision to halt oil palm expansion. Along with Indonesia, focus on yield and sustainability instead. Everyone welcomes your decision! Please, timber latex rubber plantations need to be stopped now. They drive rampant deforestation in Semanjung Malaysia.
6042 2018-09-04 12:46:36 Trump is a moron with no effect on oil prices. Markets do not trade on Trump's tweets; at least not the smart money. Saudis have played Trump's game by exporting more to US, increasing weekly inventories, artificially 'meeting' his demand. Now his tweets won't matter.
6043 2018-09-04 12:46:33 I took Zoloft for a while and those 1st two weeks wiped me out. I was immobile. I had to ween myself off and so I was down for the count for a month.  It was not good. I'd rather rub some cbd oil on my temples and go lol
6044 2018-09-04 12:46:25 anyway im gonna go wash all this oil out of my hair buh bye
6045 2018-09-04 12:46:22 @narendramodi sir, pls forget this fiscal deficit now and reduce the oil cost immediately and if possible bring under gst, first u need to be in power again, and then u can mange the fiscal, make sure oil prices don't bring u down, this reqst is from die hard BJP supporter.
6046 2018-09-04 12:46:07 oil cured, yes.
6047 2018-09-04 12:46:06 Please don’t clean your ears. They clean themselves. Just use olive oil if you need to. As I say to my patients, it’s like patting sand into a sandcastle!

6061 2018-09-04 12:44:04 This ties back to the notion that Art has been tweeting about for some time now: that peak cheap oil has, in fact, peaked a long time ago.
6062 2018-09-04 12:43:57 Lol, seeing how much you guys have looted, you have money to pay them to make fake reports. Also, if it was honey and oil, why were the bottles hidden? Looool. Do you guys still think we're dumb or what

6066 2018-09-04 12:43:18 Complete twaddle.
6067 2018-09-04 12:43:16 Wrong! The American tariffs  is what forced the Venezuela  economy into freefall. Trump WANTS all of that oil
6068 2018-09-04 12:42:58 Although think about the cost of oil derivatives for #plastic I would imagine hemp based paper (strong, needs little water to grow, 7 crops per year) is the answer. We're up against the pharmaceutical corps not wanting to loose PROFITS.  Lets be realistic PLASTIC IS BIG BUSINESS!
6069 2018-09-04 12:42:53 I think this tweet epitomizes a distinctly likely scenario: Demand Destruction + Steep supply curve could lead to a plateauing/declining demand scenario with oil prices that are, by historical standards, high.
6070 2018-09-04 12:42:48 Prices of petrol and diesel continued to increase for the tenth consecutive day today as fuel rates touched a new record high. State-run oil companies increased the price of petrol by 16 paise and that of diesel by 19 paise a litre today.
6071 2018-09-04 12:42:43 Zucchini and squash sliced. Cool in olive oil with salt and garlic. Sauté until they start to get soft. Add cherry tomatoes cut in half until cooking is finished. Dump in bowl. Sprinkle with pecorino romano. Bonus over pasta if you are eating grains.
6072 2018-09-04 12:42:42 Honey or oil in a new packing kia baat hai @BBhuttoZardari report bi change kar di corrupt ppp
6073 2018-09-04 12:42:37 I didn't make the comparison, I laughed at it. Just like I'm laughing at you.

6080 2018-09-04 12:42:04 Instead why not ask the oil companies to cut their profit and dividend payouts ?
6081 2018-09-04 12:41:58 Here's an idea, why not use NO palm oil? There's no need to use it except for cost savings. ANY demand for it only increases the destruction it's causing.

6093 2018-09-04 12:41:05  sure it is. American oil imports have been reduced massively in the past 10 years, has NOTHING to do with it. It’s far left social policies that have killed that country

6130 2018-09-04 12:36:53 The anti-fracking campaign was launched by the Kremlin to try to stop the US developing its shale oil industry. It's failed - and the US is now the leading energy producer in the world. Putin is furious - and a whole lot poorer than he would like to be.

6165 2018-09-04 12:32:59 This whole dopey tax is silly. Seems to me that small business/construction being hurt by this. If oil is so expensive why don't we incentivize manufacturers 2 make AFFORDABLE electric cars? How do we move away from gas vehicles when electric cars are SO much more expensive?
6166 2018-09-04 12:32:58 Wouldnt mind the good oil at all...
6167 2018-09-04 12:32:56 Oh that is right your a Muslim ally you would rather use oil from Saudi Arabia than your own country .
6168 2018-09-04 12:32:51 Saute some butternut squash noodles or carrot medallions in olive oil, add a bunch of "coleslaw blend" or similar salad, stir in a creamy sauce like peanut-coconut (you can even use guacamole). Optional: start with panko crumbs, finish with parmesan.

6172 2018-09-04 12:32:38 Just a Question from those trending #BahutHuiMahangaiKiMaar , when the Oil prices  are Cheap then its not coz of Modi but coz international oil prices are low, but now the international oil prices increased so instead of referring to that, opposition blaming Modi, Are they Nuts?
6173 2018-09-04 12:32:33 Actually water and oil can mix when it comes to Politics in Nigeria. What an Irony indeed.

6176 2018-09-04 12:32:10 You will be surprised at how many people will tell you that we should print more money then we'll be rich and that we should cut the petrol price with no consideration for the oil price, and fix this and that while they're not interested in paying taxes...
6177 2018-09-04 12:32:09 I think you’re misguided here. Where is the hate and isolationism? Last I checked we were 1/2 for largest oil exports. Business isn’t slowing down anytime soon.

Look at how China has already abused and depleted Africa’s resources of the last decade.

6180 2018-09-04 12:31:34 Hydro is an excellent peaker, indeed. But the cost of building and operating hydro and oil generators are certainly not internalized in the cost of nuclear. And don't get me wrong; I'm not advocating they should be.

6219 2018-09-04 12:26:27 Doing, not having is the real success! 

If you stole or cut corners to get rich, you're a very poor man. 

That's why Nigeria is a poor country despite all its natural oil deposits! 

Go create a product and you're about to change the world. 

And get very wealthy from so doing!
6220 2018-09-04 12:26:25 Still say would wear poppy if was left to those who fell in the first and second wars, not the conflicts to protect oil and invade countries since, get troops out of 6 counties, iran, iraq, Afghanistan, etc
6221 2018-09-04 12:26:15 Did anyone say Tides paid YOU? You are a minnow, nobody.

6289 2018-09-04 12:20:13 CO2 is good for plants BUT "is also the chief culprit of climate change. Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years." 1 of 2

6304 2018-09-04 12:18:47 For you, 80% of France not good enough?

Actually, they have more than 80% but that the domestic number
They export lots

Most of the balance is hydro

Which IMO is the first choice if you have mountains + rain

Tiny amount is oil which Macron has already mandated to get rid of.

6322 2018-09-04 12:17:01 The reason is
Hindus who believe in their faith don't own any vast resources as
1. Muslims own Oil
2. Christians looted Wealth by colonial extortion of big continents 
3. Chinese earned through Authoritarian suppression of own labour.

While rich Hindus behave as slaves of all.

6327 2018-09-04 12:16:05 Because Iran is under sanction, not the UK, hypothetically they will buy our services with their oil. Hence that oil becomes our and we can sell whoever we want, namely EU.

6481 2018-09-04 11:55:21 Oil and gas in the ground are not the same as cash in the bank. HMG is in effect covering their cash flow, and charging for the service.
6482 2018-09-04 11:55:21 @realDonaldTrump How about a little focus on oil prices.  Patriots would really like to pay less at the pump and lower oil would hurt Russia.  How about it?
6483 2018-09-04 11:55:19 The signs are all there. Low oil prices helped delay the inevitable

6494 2018-09-04 11:54:25 You are saying things that I have already said. Crude oil price was in increasing trend till 2014 and it falled to even 50 US dollars/barrel but nothing happened in India under Modi govt. Now you are asking to check 2004 data, why?
6495 2018-09-04 11:54:24 The Rand was at that level because of Ramaphoria not Zuma.
Crude oil prices were also lower than they are today when Zuma left.
6496 2018-09-04 11:54:19 Malaysia once understudied Nigeria’s palm oil industry in the 50s when we were the largest producer of palm oil. Today, Nigeria imports palm oil from Malaysia.

6500 2018-09-04 11:54:00 Crude prices fell between Jul14-Feb16, opening opportunities for @FinMinIndia to raise duties & shave off low price benefit to consumers. Helped in collecting unforeseen amount of money to level debts of Oil Cos & announce welfare freebies.

6519 2018-09-04 11:51:37 But in this case the funny thing is, the analysis in itself *can* have worth. They're just ridiculously overstretching the conclusions.

6538 2018-09-04 11:49:48 thing with oil is, it’s not a moisturizer - it’s a sealant.  Using something like coconut oil on dry hair is only beneficial as a prepoo.  If your hair is high porosity, even on wet hair, the coconut oil will not be enough to seal in the moisture.  You need product.

6627 2018-09-04 11:40:37 Effective price of petrol btw was less than 70 in last three years, that means you enjoyed low cost petrol for three years due to low crude oil price. Last 6 months only, petrol is on higher side.
6628 2018-09-04 11:40:36 My guess is, unless you do geoengineering they won't make it to 30 years. We should concentrate on climate change survival techniques and technologies. And oil/gas needs to change to Thorium Nuclear power.

6643 2018-09-04 11:39:18 Iran will keep selling oil regardless of so-called US sanctions on the country’s crude shipments, President Hassan Rouhani said.
Iran is “facing an economic & psychological war and that oil, gas & petrochemicals are on the frontier to face off hostility,” Rouhani said on Tuesday.
6644 2018-09-04 11:38:46 Petrol price is not constant across cities. Please check data, it has crossed 80 Rs in many places in 2013. Should i send the link ? Also crude oil price cost is very less in effective price, but it gives room for revenue for your benefits only

6652 2018-09-04 11:37:26 I actually like the "oil to build" system because basically no oil=no equipment=no armoured divisions, air force or navy which is the same end result of running out of fuel, but without the AI failing the micro, but I'm a minority

6677 2018-09-04 11:33:46 States can decrease the oil price
6678 2018-09-04 11:33:38 The sharp rise in Manmohan period was due to the massive hike in crude oil price where it went from 77 US dollars/barrel in 2010 to 107 US dollars/barrel in 2011. Now the crude oil price is again 77 US dollars/barrel and petrol price is 81 compared to 70 in 2011. Why so??

6687 2018-09-04 11:32:20 I came to work feeling good and refreshed. I washed my truck this morning. I was good. Then boss sends me a text about my oil was low. Like real low. I didn’t respond because I’ve dealt with this before. I knew they were going to service my truck. It’s on me.

6689 2018-09-04 11:32:19 Lol. They had no other forms of export to help balance out the drop in oil prices. When 95% of your total economy is based on one export and that export shits the bed, you're going to experience some issues.

6695 2018-09-04 11:31:40 Tbh, it's stressful to watch the news rn. Inflation rate getting the soul out of our budgets. Oil/Fare hikes. On top of that, politics in our country is like a comedy show with some of the officials being the biggest joke in Ph history.
6696 2018-09-04 11:31:35 What we need is a good old fashion war like Iraq where we don't even get paid back for it. Yes your brother should of taken the oil to pay our debt off for that war. Shame.

6702 2018-09-04 11:31:03 If I were up to my hardhat in debt, at interest rates of 5-7% and going up, and on the drilling hamster wheel praying for higher oil prices to bail me out of the mess I made for myself (thank God, I'm not)...I'd be very nervous about "other" folk's debt and demand destruction.
6703 2018-09-04 11:30:58 because in year 2013 there was global slowdown, rise in oil prices, INR depreciation,....wait for some time, Modi Govt is going to cross that level also, just like it has done for INR and oil prices....

6714 2018-09-04 11:29:05 Good points. For example take russia which adjusted much much better to sanctions and the oil shock because of flexible exchange rates helped adjust to the TOT shock. If it had kept the rub in the band would have been much more painful, as indeed the oil shock was for Nigeria.
6715 2018-09-04 11:29:03 Yes. It was partly owned by the oil marketers as well.

6721 2018-09-04 11:28:16 In a time when there was a shortage. And don't think that there wasn't an insurance payout for a considerable amount to fix the pipeline. I also heard that oil tankers are kept off the coast until reserves drop enough to increase prices.
Supply and demand doesn't apply to gas now

6743 2018-09-04 11:25:51 Intense moving of oil prices is really a key concern for the #economy. The #rupee depreciation definitely hurts the growth in the near future. The #government has to do some restructuring to curb the #inflation as well as to sustain the animal spirit of the economy.

6786 2018-09-04 11:21:42 Fracking will always be used to recover vast untapped assets, even if current crop of frackers goes bankrupt. However, we can’t afford to burn that oil, ultimately it’s a trapped asset.  We should use our relatively newfound assets to rapidly transition to alt energy! 
6787 2018-09-04 11:21:37 Yep remember Dopey Salmond at the Ref saying oil price won’t go under $50 dollars a barrel. Thick as shit as it was $130 then & it’s risen to $60 now. He’s as incompetent as Wee Jimmy.

 It varies in severity - blocked pores, pimples, large painful & bigger nodules/ scarring. 
It needs patience and persistence to treat - AVOID using just 'any' cream.

6954 2018-09-04 10:59:05 @RonnieChopra1  It must be getting very tempting for EM countries to circumvent US sanctions on Iranian Oil, given how expensive Oil is (almost $80) and priced in USD.  At some point the discounts gotta be worth it, probably routing via a 3rd country.
6955 2018-09-04 10:59:04 I dont believe in this kind of propaganda. However, depending upon oil should stop as soon as possible.

6981 2018-09-04 10:54:53 The UK Gov turned it into a massive tax allowance which companies have been recouping whilst they can. It means of course a short-term massive negative against North Sea oil revenues.

7070 2018-09-04 10:40:15 Truth is the next Nigerian oil is in agriculture. I tell you @nancyilloh, if you devote more time beyond the subsistence you do in your abode, 5 years is too long a period before you become big time millionaire.
7071 2018-09-04 10:40:09 #scotgov is 100% correct to be supporting solutions that exist now and are gaining traction in the marketplace.
Oil industry lobbyists have decrying electric cars forever, beware their motives in wanting you to pick a winner that never materialises (as Wales appears to have done)

Neither @BJP4India nor @INCIndia are bothered about that, since they are not affected directly with this hike plus their major financial backbone is KB from Oil companies.

7128 2018-09-04 10:31:37 Yoons argue that Scotland is a basket case while completely ignoring the fact that Labour and Tory parties oversaw the destruction of Scotland’s economy as oil was found and the money was squandered by successive U.K. Governments. Some Scots are too stupid #DissolveTheUnion

As Tesla got more and more hyped & closer to the mass market, big oil got threatened.

#Drastic action should be taken before it slip into 75 ₹/$

7201 2018-09-04 10:20:25 Bottom line:  In a time when the US has a glut of oil, the Middle Class (working class must buy most gas-at-pump) loses their tax cut $ to buy gas, while Big Oil n Big Govt, thru gas taxes, get richer. The voting public is not as stupid as elected Establishment believes. Awake!

7205 2018-09-04 10:19:50 Cat fines are a result of FCC byproducts like LCO being used to cut the viscosity of fuel oil. Once sulphur is down to 0.5%, viscosity will usually be far below 380CST anyway, so presence of cat fines should drop in 2020. Best not to quote a scrubber salesman on blending!

7339 2018-09-04 10:00:00 The macho party of Mr 56" seems to be imploding as nervousness grips. It is an irreversible decline on every front; oil prices, job crisis, farmer unrest, rising inflation, national security, communal tensions, Dalit protests, violence against women etc. #BJP_भगाओ_देश_बचाओ
7340 2018-09-04 09:59:57 SA GDP comes in at -0.7% in Q2.

7342 2018-09-04 09:59:44 And you come across as easily bedazzled by snake oil salesman as for calling a woman hysterical..I see you also have misogynistic tendencies. I am not open to your lecturing. I know what I have read from Bannon and you have no idea

7346 2018-09-04 09:58:52 2 of 2. "...The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years...."

7350 2018-09-04 09:58:27 UNEP findings disclose that oil contamination in the oil-rich Niger Delta area since the late 1950s is extensive, inflicting grave, negative impacts on the environment, requiring upward of 30yrs to remediate. #CleanUpNigerDeltaNow #PassAllPIBsNow @BrigGen50
7351 2018-09-04 09:58:24 Please say something about how my country Canada isn't doing nearly enough to meet #ParisAgreement we even bought a pipeline for tar sands for 4,5$ billion despite indigenous saying no @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna we also approved BP to drill for oil offshore of Nova Scotia
7352 2018-09-04 09:58:18 Put on heat. Put 4mm of table salt in so cooking surface is covered. Keep on heat. Move salt about with wooden spoon and shaking. About 10 minutes at max. Do not burn yourself, it'sa500 degrees. Wash with water only and dry. Rub some oil into it when it cools. Good as new
7353 2018-09-04 09:58:05 After drinking this honey  and olive oil one can see BHUTTO ALIVE lol
7354 2018-09-04 09:57:57 there's a chapter of moby dick that details how the sailors process & store the whale oil after they've killed a whale & they just have their hands in a vat of "sperm", squidging the chunks. it makes your hands really soft apparently. it's very homoerotic
7355 2018-09-04 09:57:43 Guys I fell a while ago and I have this bruise on my leg That Won't go away. I've been using magnolia oil but it's too slow. help
7356 2018-09-04 09:57:43 As expected but hoped against, SA is now in a recession due to low economic activity, slow global growth, EMs seeing proper flames this year, crazy high oil prices...Modimo [@StatsSA]

7358 2018-09-04 09:57:29 Never had to deal with it; all my recent diesels have been Euro 5/6 Japanese.
Genuine emissions without adding any dodgy substances or oil between service intervals...
Have spilt plenty of diesel, engine oil and petrol on nice shoes in my time though!

7362 2018-09-04 09:56:14 @PeterROCK_ This is how I think in Nigeria some men think of feminist.... But since it's naija .. .Switch the oil for peanut oil
7363 2018-09-04 09:56:04 If govt is having little control on daily rise then let's have a control on your perks & salaries of oil companies employees
7364 2018-09-04 09:56:00 Our prices are competitive, our fuel products are quality-assured, and our delivery service is second to none. As your local #oil supplier, we are proud to offer you an excellent, personal service from start to finish.
7365 2018-09-04 09:55:58 How he was FM in UPA is surprise worldwide's oil prices increased which all blind politicians nit aware but ready to blame BJP govt
7366 2018-09-04 09:55:56 Chavez nationalized oil industry, agriculture, transportation, power generation, telecommunications, steel, banks. But not real socialism. Really?? 
7367 2018-09-04 09:55:46 R26.R now booked for oil service next week, time not miles! 9991 on the clock today. #renaultsport #r26r
7368 2018-09-04 09:55:35 correct, that is what we had during the GWB & BHO yrs. We lost high $ MFG JOBS & they focused on low paying service sector JOBS. POTUS DJT knows to MAGA we need a strong MFG base again. MFG, oil, coal, energy sectors have high paying jobs. POTUS DJT First is winning 4 
7369 2018-09-04 09:55:35 All countries should try to bring some stability on oil prices and can't allow to move one way without any consideration for cost of production. This oil spike is breaking the back of many countries economy. Will world wake up.
7370 2018-09-04 09:55:20 And ur Oga is still wasting resources looking 4 oil in d lake chad basin??
7371 2018-09-04 09:55:05 Si ça pouvait exploser un peu avant les midterms...
7372 2018-09-04 09:54:53 Almajiranchi issues are very complex,its beyond threads if you understand the dynamics,it'll take Godly intervention for it to come to an end.
7373 2018-09-04 09:54:52 This serves as oil to my lamp. Thank you.
7374 2018-09-04 09:54:48 Will not take criticism from liam. No word of a lie, despite being a chemistry/science guy, a few days before 22 I had to explain why his eggs stick to the pan because he has a bizarre preference to fry them before the bacon, without any oil or butter.
7375 2018-09-04 09:54:42 Do you think it will look this good after EPA DEREGULATION gone wild? It looks this good because of stringent climate controls, carbon capture and renewable energies. It will cease if we allow dirty coal, oil drilling in the Alaska refuge and Arctic ice melting! DEATH BY TRUMP 45
7376 2018-09-04 09:54:24 Yes been to the royal Marsden once but the fact she has lost a kidney kind of works against her for selection for a trial I’m hopeful given time one may be offered we have secured some CBD and THC oil and are going to try it  given the stories in the press it should be trialed 1
7377 2018-09-04 09:54:13 The challenge with country comparisons is they are limited given their unique challenges and development needs. For example in terms of wealth inequality S.A ranks 1st globally while in HDI Nigeria is 6 points below Kenya. Yet their issues are different: S.A is land & Nigeria oil
7378 2018-09-04 09:54:09 Not yet. I’m trying coconut oil and castor oil. I’m also on the hair growth vitamins from Dischem. Apparently it takes time 
7379 2018-09-04 09:54:08 Pakistan can benefit alot from the new research of PPP govt. in Sind. By changing alcohol in to honey & olive oil Pakistan can boost its export & decrease the trade deficit to the minimum
7380 2018-09-04 09:54:06 Oil prices are rising if you haven't noticed please stop playing.  However oil prices do fluctuate.The issue is how you manage that. Norway made £29,000,000,000 during price fall. The UK lost £23,000,000.
7381 2018-09-04 09:53:32 please do not buy products that contain palm oil from farms in Indonesia and Brazil who chop down rainforests
7382 2018-09-04 09:53:24 It's not even a week since the oil prices increased and now prices of other commodities have increased. Sai ati chapo ya 10 bob ni 15. This is absurd. #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
7383 2018-09-04 09:53:19 It controls the oil and gas fields that fall within its waters, electricity generation, air transportation and marine navigation. It decides its own constitutional arrangements, including whether to be a monarchy or a republic, the regulation and licensing of political parties
7384 2018-09-04 09:53:11 Not sure your oil drenched picture of a meal is healthy ... hehehehe
7385 2018-09-04 09:53:06 Producers who try to recreate iconic TV shows should be coated in Lib oil and tossed into a Dump rally.
7386 2018-09-04 09:53:00 You go Nina!!!.  I would LOVE to know the answer to this!. I wonder if there was any $$$ involved in the form of kick backs??? Perhaps the heart association, out like you said the vegetable oil manufacturers

7389 2018-09-04 09:52:26 You have the liberty not to vote for him. We Indians understand basics of market economy and escalating oil prices. We dont mind making the change and being part of that change. Our Acche Din is here and we intend to retain it
7390 2018-09-04 09:51:45 Can you imagine the dusting he has to do!
And the smell of that much metal, oil and grease!!!
7391 2018-09-04 09:51:39 To remove labels with tacky glue off glass jars or plastic containers...
Take the top layer of the sticker off, revealing the stubborn glue.
Then, drizzle a few drops of olive/veg. oil on the glue & gently wipe the oily glue off, with swirling motions using paper tissue/towel.
7392 2018-09-04 09:51:26 DM d tweet shot pls
7393 2018-09-04 09:51:24 I wish all the oil companies endorse Kap...so all the people boycotting and burning they Nike shoes can all walk to work...
7394 2018-09-04 09:51:17 Malaysia once understudied Nigeria’s palm oil industry in the 50s when we were the largest producer of palm oil. Today, Nigeria imports palm oil from Malaysia. This is the same way Ghana overtook Nigeria in Yam exports. Reversing these trends must be Nigeria’s focus! #RenosDarts
7395 2018-09-04 09:51:07 Oil is the answer to a girlfriend

7398 2018-09-04 09:50:49 The single point mooring (SPM) of Kochi Refinery Bharat Petroleum Corporation has received its 1000th crude oil tanker. Launched in 2007 in Kochi waters to receive very large crude carriers, the SPM has handled 109 million tonnes of crude so far
7399 2018-09-04 09:50:47 これはしんどいですな(TдT)
7400 2018-09-04 09:50:35 I love how there's so many different types of oils. Almond oil, Carrot oil, corn oil, even cottonseed oil; fam. From the SEED of cotton. You can get oil anywhere! You know what I want? Oil Oil.
7401 2018-09-04 09:50:27 Participate in a phony war to be killed by your own guys in friendly fire?
We went into IRAQ for oil while OBL who was responsible for 9*11 was in Afghanistan.  FFS.
This guy's death was a horrible tragedy that should have been avoided.  It was a for nothing.

7413 2018-09-04 09:47:58 So just rub olive oil in and leave? 
7414 2018-09-04 09:47:50 Hi Mark, I'm really sorry to hear about your partner.  There is no clinical evidence yet that cannabis oil can kill cancer - but there is evidence it can help with side effects of disease.  Have you discussed Clinical Trials with the oncologist?

7416 2018-09-04 09:47:40 The left confuse the diesel fuel rebate with subsidies. You will find in 9 out of 10 cases the DFR is mentioned as the multi billion dollar "subsidy" given to the coal & oil industries. They have no clue.
7417 2018-09-04 09:47:36 love you all
7418 2018-09-04 09:47:29 As expected...technical recession upon us Mzansi.

7421 2018-09-04 09:47:20 The British were coming to seize the powder stored in blockhouses, a communal powder storage facility since in the near of candles, oil lamps and cook fires your neighbors took an intense dislike to those who kept too much in their house, and 10th amendment details states rights

7425 2018-09-04 09:46:23 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

7432 2018-09-04 09:45:49 oil producers are never allowed to develop their economies in case they gain their own manufacturing base and cease to export their oil. the west would lose control of the most critical natural resource for their own economies.

7440 2018-09-04 09:43:48 Absolute disgrace by Gov on a misaligned policy for onshore exploration. They are happy to take the taxes on oil but fuck all else in return

7443 2018-09-04 09:43:38 Anytime bro
7444 2018-09-04 09:43:38 Just as CIA 'DeepState' are the puppet masters of POTUS, so MI5 control our Government. They'd are rightly concerned that JC won't play their game. But that's why he's needed; here and in the countries the 'allies' are tearing up for oil, arms deals & power.

7457 2018-09-04 09:40:52 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7460 2018-09-04 09:40:27 Fuel should have gone up 25c but only up 5c because government is bearing increase for one month only. Could seriously backfire as once a benefit is given it is hard to retract . If current rand and oil price stay same the increase next month will be terrible as relief falls off
7461 2018-09-04 09:40:20 You're  so committed to the environment that I hardly recognised you as the same company that took ten years to clean up a massive oil spill in Nigeria and who Amnesty International branded as negligent.

7465 2018-09-04 09:39:51 I’d imagine having oil burns on your hands would make certain things difficult.
7466 2018-09-04 09:39:48 
7467 2018-09-04 09:39:36 oil dey your head 
7468 2018-09-04 09:39:14 Well that depends. I think  not sure if it was @VanJones68 who said it best the 2016 results were a #whitelash but lets get real here. “Minorities” will overtake the white population within this generation (population wise) .. #bannon is a snake oil merchant. Knowledge=Power
7469 2018-09-04 09:39:06 Obviously the petrol price is pinching all, but does not mean economy is in shambles. Surplus revenue is used to clear the oil deficit pool accumulated over last 10 years, which was a ticking bomb.
7470 2018-09-04 09:39:05 Tried fried rice yesterday. Used coconut oil. Tasted soooo good. Like coconut fried rice (the one you actually put the coconut milk). Maybe not as ‘coconuty’ but you get. Yum

7478 2018-09-04 09:37:44 @arunjaitley @narendramodi @ndtv @CNNnews18 why Govt not intervening to strengthen rupee. Does it care for importers & oil and petroleum products. Common man is suffering govt looks only tax money in petrol. Is nation interest not seen to strengthen Rupee so v pay less on imports
7479 2018-09-04 09:37:43 What is "oil is a bonus" based on? Show me some figures. The Scottish Government's own will do.

7481 2018-09-04 09:37:38 Oh yes, in fact when you grab a diesel pump while treading with your Italian shoes on a dirty floor full of oil, you can finally appreciate the environment and you can mix your Paco Rabanne with Shell scent on your body. That's not awful, isn't it?

7487 2018-09-04 09:36:45 Have you see the amount of olive oil he uses that can’t be healthy!!
7488 2018-09-04 09:36:41 My question too could. Befire we had any idea of oil in Turkana Kenya had a refinery. It was doing well. Why can't we've one now that we've oil?
7489 2018-09-04 09:36:20 Do not understand when people say "I/my mom make the best curry ever" and all I see in their pictures is oil. Itna oil daaloge toh tasty toh banni hi hai curry! 
7490 2018-09-04 09:36:17 I'm unsure how you managed to post this tweet without also contributing to this slow death - every computer/phone/tablet ever created requires Oil in its production process and the amount of fossil fuels expended in transport, lighting, manufacturing these devices is massive
7491 2018-09-04 09:36:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
7492 2018-09-04 09:36:01 agreed on that but its currently roulette on their hatch, so surely a derogation to use seed dressing should be allowed whilst this work is undertaken? Do you want to import more Canola oil from the other side of the world ? Last year it was around 22/8 this year 4/9

7496 2018-09-04 09:35:11 I think the oil use will be obselete before the supply comes to an end.

The reserves show availabilty of oil supply for more than the coming 50-60 years.
7497 2018-09-04 09:35:03 It is an irony that despite paying over 4 lac less on import of crude oil in comparison to 2013-14 in 2017 benefits didn't go to consumers.

7499 2018-09-04 09:34:53 This is not good news, though the demand is exponential. India’s aviation industry losses could reach $ 1.9 billion this year.
1. Ticket prices have not risen to compensate for higher costs
2. Depreciation of ₹ and rise in oil prices are major factors affecting aviation industry
7500 2018-09-04 09:34:45 Banning everything with sugar in or taxing it yet pours half a gallon of oil over a salad or anything to be honest?! Don’t see which is worse...
7501 2018-09-04 09:34:24 Given global tension I would prefer we just ensured at least a three month stockpile of oil reserves.

7503 2018-09-04 09:34:18 Throwing logic into MAGA actions is like trying to put oil and water together: they don’t mix.

7508 2018-09-04 09:33:32 It's full name is Spermaceti and it was why these whales were hunted. This substance was used in oil lamps and as engineering oil.
7509 2018-09-04 09:33:24 Specifically what assets?  I honestly can't think of any save for the oil/gas that are less strong than they were.  Isnt it the case that if Indy had happened the Scottish economy would now be wrecked based on the reduced oil price blowing apart the budget?
7510 2018-09-04 09:33:23 Coal, Oil and Gas attract $3.5bn in government subsidies per year. Take away all subsidies and there still won't be anyone willing to build a new coal fired electricity plant.
7511 2018-09-04 09:32:45 I think I would feel ripped off if I paid 400 for an oil change but some people have so much money that it probably seems ok 75k per year for a car mechanic but they all look poor .

7513 2018-09-04 09:32:01 Most of EE project was reversing a current pipe and extending it. Renews aren't reliable we need oil & need to move it safely. Pipelines are the least polluting, safest method of transport.

7518 2018-09-04 09:31:11 UK gas demand in 2017 was around 850TWh, oil consumption also 800TWh. So entire EU wind and solar could not displace just UK gas. Keepitintheground keep saying 90% FF must remain buried, but hide that much of this is coal, 50% of known gas reserves can be used in 2deg target.

7526 2018-09-04 09:29:40 If cooked in a pan I’ll do all kinda of stuff. My fave is cooking it right in the red oil left from chorizo. It sticks real bad but the flavor is worth it. 

I will however eat a completely plain hard boiled egg first thing in the morning.
7527 2018-09-04 09:29:16 But what happened to the old war cry that the oil and gas industry would make us financially secure if we went independent! Was that a lie, too?!
7528 2018-09-04 09:29:02 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
7529 2018-09-04 09:28:53 Other than oil  prices, can you counter the various figures given by this govt on economy.
7530 2018-09-04 09:28:53 Can we also see similar comparison for domestic oil prices??
7531 2018-09-04 09:28:40 Daughter wants to make a grocery run. With toddlers seems you always forget something. It's been quiet on this end and food supplies normal. Son wants falafel I'm out of oil. @HRafferty1 and @imanlibya not seen online yet. Keep in touch with folks even if just for support.

7533 2018-09-04 09:28:21 That's actually humorous. North Sea Oil hasn't figured positively in UK accounts for some time, Whisky industry isn't big enough to influence it besides it's not how currency works.
7534 2018-09-04 09:28:00 DJT must be pretty sure he can kick the shit out of Venezuela.  Then, take their oil and it will pay for the whole thing, right?

7545 2018-09-04 09:26:45 What is happening in our society when people have to revert to their local radio station to get rights-based issues resolved? I often wonder if others suffer as a result of the ‘squeaky wheel’ getting the oil. 
7546 2018-09-04 09:26:40 oil, crude etc will not swing the market so much as both have been heading north for quite sometime now..  its the uncertainty of what may come further from SC (more states will be pulled up or how??) thats causing the panic.. once that is out of the way markets will head up

7551 2018-09-04 09:25:24 You can also see that when the Russian economy declines (as it does when the oil price falls) economies dependent on Russia suffers too: Belarus, Moldova. But Ukraine wasn't affected by the 2014 decline because it move its trade toward EU.
7552 2018-09-04 09:24:57 Import of crude oil up in lost four years, coz rise in neo middle class, whose purchase power strengthened.That's are the real reason for oil price rise. Reality is rise of oil prices. So state and central governments should equally responsible for heavy tax on petrol and diesel

7605 2018-09-04 09:17:27 Sir,selling P&D at subsidised rates is d easiest option. UPA spent 7+lakh crores on subsides & also left 50000 crs Iran oil import bill unpaid. As an economist tell us what is prudent- tax all to foot oil bill or make only Consumer pay? why don’t you quit BJP and hit streets?

7747 2018-09-04 08:58:33 @anasalhajji Dear Dr. Anas, if you believe that oil is a "fossil fuel" product, why it doesn't exist in all countries in the world as far as fossils has existed over time in each part of earth? Why KSA is the most producer taking into account its size compared to U.S and Russia?

7758 2018-09-04 08:56:45 Oil traded near US$ 70 a barrel. Barclays Plc raised it's 2020 crude forecast to US$ 75 a barrel from US$ 55 which it predicted in July last year. The bank also increased it's 2025 estimate to US$ 80 a barrel from US$ 70
7759 2018-09-04 08:56:30 The bit I struggle to understand is this: Even if the critics are correct and tight oil is not making money, then a slightly higher oil price solves everything, unless someone finds a new source of marginal oil.
7760 2018-09-04 08:56:08 Is money the only form trade? You can trade with goods and services. Maybe the more expensive yams and palm oil should be returned. 
Obviously no sensible man should think he his buying a wife or their daughter. But husband and wife are not equal, the man is higher!

7807 2018-09-04 08:46:38 It wasn't the oil that started the civil war in Cyria or Yemen. It was the water. No nation turns against each other over oil or gas. And yes when a nation shows weakness and become vulnerable it's time for forigne Invaders to show up and took what ever they can.

7834 2018-09-04 08:42:05 Great idea. At this rate, it should be demolished in time for the next oil shock. Saudi Aramco IPO — biggest in world history — was pulled (full public disclosure of reserves? Uh, can’t have that), and “future” of US shale oil is on track to collapse.

7895 2018-09-04 08:31:10 This Princeton take is scary because if indeed North America has that large a proportion of oil reserves, it will separate the global haves from the have-nots even more -- #PeakOil.  But then consider that all this new oil predicted in the USA is bottom-of-the-barrel pickings!

7937 2018-09-04 08:24:05 Many factors closed down industrial heartlands. With North Sea oil we lost industry through having an oil boosted pound. GB also pursued a high pound policy. On top of that we had the EU reducing some of our two-way trading by imposing tariffs on imports.

7957 2018-09-04 08:18:43 That is linked to International price of crude whereas what I am talking about is the recovery made from excise duty that is charged on petrol and diesel. A part of the amount earned from excise is passed on to states while rest is used to pay for the Oil Bonds issued by UPA.

7968 2018-09-04 08:17:10 I also hope that the role of outsider oil analysts figures in to the book. For example, the Red Queen effect that you allude to in the NYT article (i.e. fast shale oil decline meaning more wells)  was popularized and verified on Peak Oil blogs.  Oil industry never mentioned it.
7969 2018-09-04 08:16:55 We, and a handful of other countries somehow manage to find the funds and man power to intervene in other countries issues, particularly when there's oil involved.

7979 2018-09-04 08:15:24 The only point that this occurs is when fossil fuels start dwindling, and green energy becomes cheaper than alternatives.

This will happen naturally over the next 30 years.

However, the main issue is oil, not energy. When the price of oil starts accelerating, all bets are off.

Switch to renewables as baseload with fossil fuels (gas) as "peaker" plants. = cheaper, more secure energy.
8054 2018-09-04 08:03:51 So you agree that Scottish independence won’t impact trade with England then? Because it would seem to be more harmful to England to put up barriers to Scottish services, cut power lines, stop importing oil, food, etc.

I voted for you, but will not vote for you again if you allow another U.S false flag attack in Syria! Its obvious

8165 2018-09-04 07:49:48 At one time, analysts such as Lynch could blow smoke about the decline in oil production since reliable numbers were hard to come by. But since the NoDak state govt puts all the numbers out for Bakken, it's very easy to follow the depletion trends.

8268 2018-09-04 07:31:16 Oil companies are not buying on daily basis. They have a rate contract with petrol companies and hence they would be getting Brent Crude in less than Retail Price. Other factor is it would take atleast 2 month to import oil in India from Gulf.

8287 2018-09-04 07:28:46 This is great, but how does the country rationalize producing over 1 million barrels of oil per day?  Does oil money subsidize green energy?

8295 2018-09-04 07:27:48 These levels of economic rent extraction are unsustainable in my view. I think China - as Buyer of Last Resort- is intent on assembling & demonstrating buy-side market power. We are seeing a historic oil market inflection point
8296 2018-09-04 07:27:47 mostly insurance + gas, then factor in: 
oil changes every ~10,000km (diy is 70 for synthetic 50 for conventional)
tires every couple years, less often if you have a set of winters as well.

 "Fresh case" implies there was something wrong with the 2014 case. Turns out we can use the pound, we can join the EU, voting no doesn't keep us in the EU, we're not equal partners in the UK, and there is more oil in the North Sea.

- season your steak, dont over season it, takes away the flavor.
- cook with olive oil, again depending on the cut the fat already has excess oil which gives the steak flavor.

(Abu Dawud: 27/21)
It frightens me that people today are calling alcohol by other names like honey and olive oil. It frightens me even more that many of us are making jokes about it.

8706 2018-09-04 06:17:28 Guess what?

Since 1980 Scotland has ran up deficits (accumulated debt) of around -£163bn in nominal terms (before inflation)

After inflation it was a mere  -£145bn, even after oil revenues, which is rather ironic since our share of the national debt to date is about £145bn!

For all those who love peel off ask leave the ACV&add Gelatine(no flavour)
8715 2018-09-04 06:16:08 I guess it has more to do with oil cartels exercising dominance all over the world than any country's govt. Oil runs the world. Remember Tesla? Similarly biogas or solar power energy is being mocked at or sidelined. Free energy doesn't mint dollars. Who cares abt the environment.
8716 2018-09-04 06:15:56 You can get it for $40 a bottle in a lower mg that will still work. It is worth it, no matter.

8814 2018-09-04 06:01:11 43000 crores are the unpaid dues to Iran by India for importing oil from Iran between and UPA government paid only 55% of it. So remaining 45% amount has to be paid by NDA government. Who will pay that money? Will you pay from Amaraja Betteries profit? Or people of the country?
8815 2018-09-04 06:01:01 Just in a recent bye election of a member of rep from Kogi, look how they shared 3 onions, sachet oil and maggi cube to voters. And people are where happy of that and vote that member. Wallahi rayuwarmu nacikin garari
8816 2018-09-04 06:00:54 I wonder how the 700billion barons or basins they keep on telling us that will make life better.A country starts producing oil and within no time it's price shoots
8817 2018-09-04 06:00:53 Remember when OIL PRICES WERE GOING DOWN ON 2014 ONWARDS PM MODIJI WAS MOCKING UPA AND PRAISING HIM AND HIS LUCK. WHERE IS THE MOCKING PM MODIJI ?PLEASE BLAME IT TO LUCK PEOPLE WILL UNDETSTAND

8825 2018-09-04 06:00:01 Most people outside US and Europe see it that way.

The bad guys never know they are the bad guys until they lose hegemony.

Obviously people know the US warmonger and now they prefer the Chinese.

In Syria it's about Gas (not oil).

8830 2018-09-04 05:59:02 Why Tax of fuel is wrong??

On the contrary it is great move.
97% of petrol used by cars and bikes.
Taxing petrol and usung the social programs for a poor is a good way of redistributing wealth from rich to poor.

It is also great for environment.
Cheap oil is bad!!!
8831 2018-09-04 05:59:00 if u dont buy from Iran and oil is $ denominated, with rising $, prices will naturally increase
8832 2018-09-04 05:58:25 there it is. Sindh police investigation team rejects lab report declaring contents as honey and olive oil.

8834 2018-09-04 05:58:12 No you two dont get it if Canada stopped all oil production tomorrow the demand that we fill would be filled by another oil producing country with less enviro standards. With global demand expected to rise until at least 2050 someone will fill that demand. We could do it better.

8854 2018-09-04 05:54:10 CURUDE OIL UPDATES:
Oil prices were mixed on Tuesday. Trade was expected to be slow as U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday for a holiday, while reports that Oman’s oil and gas minister said oil prices are unlikely to rise above $80 this year raised some eyebrows.

8855 2018-09-04 05:54:08 Helpful tip for us beards, beard oil isn’t just for your hair, it’s for your skin! Beard hairs wick away natural oils from the skin, leaving it dry and flaky. A good beard oil returns moisture to the skin, saving you from bad beardruff, as we like to call it!
8856 2018-09-04 05:53:59 @arunjaitley sir pl act swiftly in bringing down oil prices, if benefit was not passed totally on consumers so must be the losses...not according to me but according to you sir...

8861 2018-09-04 05:53:08 Mr. President Sir, No more loans....we have over-leveraged our economy, its so painful  to pay a 16% VAT on fuel knowing that we have our own oil in Turkana.
8862 2018-09-04 05:52:47 @narendramodi @PMOIndia as we have received increased IT returns and able to save lots from other savings schemes, why cnt we pass on the benefits on crude oil n domestic cylinder for common man. Defntly we can !!

8887 2018-09-04 05:49:05 You too followed the same... So will Congress promise that they will sell oil at same price to neighbours as in India?
8888 2018-09-04 05:48:59 No word yet on whether the US plans to intervene.

Maybe someone should let them know that there was oil found in Malaysia.

8896 2018-09-04 05:47:26 @narendramodi have BJP forgotten their words?

8971 2018-09-04 05:37:16 4. Trains are a lot easier to stop than pipelines. If oil-by-rail becomes a significant source of oil export, people will just block the railways.

8975 2018-09-04 05:36:23 3. Oil-by-rail is a more expensive way to ship bitumen and this will chill the sale of Canadian bitumen.

8978 2018-09-04 05:35:50 Look my statement was about more than just oil. From your case you suggest that the pipeline will redirect some of the tanker traffic and as a result there will be more chinook etc. But who can say that there won't be an increase in other vessel traffic? That was my point.
8979 2018-09-04 05:35:50 Otherwise, there can be few more efforts to apply here. You can apply Caster Oil medicated one, on the scalp, and Extra Virgin Cold first Press Olive oil for hair massage. INSHALLAH baal jharna band hojainge. Also you need to use qlty keratin to apply on hair.

Depreciating rupee is temporary, its due to US trade sanctions & also restrictions on Iran's crude oil.

9000 2018-09-04 05:32:27 Fossil fuel / crude oil is one consumer commodity that doesn’t deserve tax cut and subsidies. Tax cut can be a populist policy , beneficial in short term but bad in long term for a country.
9001 2018-09-04 05:32:19 #Vegans who eat #products with #palmoil in it are just being major #Hypocrites . Please do not buy and eat products with palm oil. Example: @EarthBalance1 , which has palm oil in it. #shame on these companies who are so greedy! Another ex: @Oreo #oreos
9002 2018-09-04 05:32:17 I'm incredibly skeptical that the rail line can handle an additional 400,000 barrels per day (a tripling of rail capacity). Oil-by-rail is already in significant competition with other exports like wheat and potash.
9003 2018-09-04 05:32:13 I heard they discovered oil in Guyana. Get ready for freedom
9004 2018-09-04 05:32:10 Britain murdered 6 million Biafrans btw 1967 and 1970 in a genocide carried out thru Nig against Biafrans, to confiscate the Biafran wealth (OIL AND GAS). Britain, still keeping hold of that wealth, is not ashamed to call their concoction, Nig, poor. Very sad indeed. Tụfịakwa.

9011 2018-09-04 05:30:59 I agreed. Doesnt matter how you look at it, history, oil money or whatever, the “top four” term was created because of the dominance of Man utd, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool during that period of time.
9012 2018-09-04 05:30:50 1. If oil-by-rail is bad, make it illegal.
2. The twinning of the trans mountain pipeline would add an additional 600,000 bpd of throughput for exporting tar sands bitumen. The maximum that has ever been shipped by rail is around 200,000 bpd.
9013 2018-09-04 05:30:48 Fake results ??
Are we all fool to accept that??

When algae and plants die, they sink to the ocean floor. Over time they become covered with sediment. The heat & pressure from the sediment turns that algae into crude oil, which then gets pumped out disbursed...

9028 2018-09-04 05:28:27 What’s most disturbing is how the news seems intent on normalizing this and conditioning urbanites to accept this as okay.

We'll get right onto not using tools which have no alternative once you stop breathing clean oxygen and drinking purified water. Then this argument will have merit.

9044 2018-09-04 05:26:42 We shouldn't fail to recognize that there is a lesser of two evils to choose.

9121 2018-09-04 05:17:36 Yes, that’s the only way, the National oil refiners (IOC/BPC/HPC) are all working on small GRM of 4-6 $/Barrel which roughly translates to ₹ 2/Ltr. Pvt. refiners are a bit better on GRM owing to higher complexity number of the refineries earning up to 10 $/Barrel.

9129 2018-09-04 05:16:52 good posts Jason. Most true is that the old economics of shale are not the new economics. Plainly put, most shale, with a few exceptions, is profitable now. Higher interest rates wouldn't matter for several years as most companies that survived refinanced during #oil crash.

9229 2018-09-04 05:01:35 Thanks for the tip about the mineral oil. I haven't really used mine all that much. Still lots of oil on them when I touch them. How often do you oil up Celestina?
9230 2018-09-04 05:01:20 We may have been going about this the wrong way. Who else can we get to endorse Kap? Fruit of the loom? Cooking oil? Michelin tires? Exxon? Fireworks?

9232 2018-09-04 05:01:00 Seems that most of what’s eaten in Japan is fermented... changes the impact significantly. Low consumption of whole bean or soy isolate, and very low PUFA soybean oil. And their diet overall is high meat & fish, high omega 3:6 ratio, low refined carbs & sugar

9238 2018-09-04 04:59:40 Trump has been selling snake oil for decades. You just need a few more uneducated people to believe you to make a sale. This is what he now uses Fox (faux) News for. Honest Cultist Opinion.

9269 2018-09-04 04:52:34 Congress took loans through oil bonds to the tune of Rs 1.44 lakh crore. This amount along with an interest of Rs 70,000 crore was paid by the Modi government. This is again an example of how Congress ruins while BJP repairs yet all the abuse is hurled at the BJP.

9367 2018-09-04 04:39:23 Wish and ye shall receive...

But don't come grovelling for our oil and lumber then either eh. Oh and by the way, you can keep your medicated milk. Quite frankly it's horific that you would even expose pre-pubescent children to such chemicals. That's grotesque and disgusting.
9368 2018-09-04 04:39:22 need some more oil for my hair
9369 2018-09-04 04:39:18 I can’t tell the difference.
The both taste like sump oil to me.
9370 2018-09-04 04:39:11 People minding their business with no political affiliation thrown to the door for being a targeted regime,  all cause a idiot doesn't want to share oil, or just ego... UN has to be replaced this is  to close to Home, with an agenda they're useless
9371 2018-09-04 04:39:08 I swear I have at least like $200 in completely unused oil paint brushes and clay sculpting tools. Don’t buy a single supply until the day they say you are gonna start using it
9372 2018-09-04 04:39:04 I always use face wash (oil control) which makes dry and fresh up my skin but later on again oilness comes on my skin within 2-3 hours mostly on forehead but little on cheeks.
9373 2018-09-04 04:38:51 The blessing of God on you is like an indelible imprint. Thick honey that you can't ignore. Dripping oil from your head.
9374 2018-09-04 04:38:44 So did the blow up their car because they were using Russian oil to make the gasoline?
9375 2018-09-04 04:38:31 HYSSOP OIL at HYSSOP EYE DROPS ang galing instant effect talaga!!!

9378 2018-09-04 04:37:56 coming back to my apt after a few days the air is super stale so we’ve got an open window + essential oil diffuser + incense
9379 2018-09-04 04:37:38 U.S. #oil prices rose on Tuesday, breaking past $70 per barrel, after two Gulf of #Mexico oil platforms were evacuated in preparation for a hurricane.
9380 2018-09-04 04:37:25 The entire picture should be circled because even the two people in the photo need oil and gas to exist.
9381 2018-09-04 04:37:08 LJ: Do you miss your baby daddy?
Me: huh?
LJ: Do you miss your baby daddy?
Me: Where’s the Holy Oil? 
9382 2018-09-04 04:36:57 Well keep in mind that other things can cause hair loss such as thyroid issues & anemia, also autoimmune conditions such as alopecia, try massaging neem oil into your scalp as it can also help to kill off bacteria Etc
9383 2018-09-04 04:36:56 Lelaki tak pakai makeup so rasanya boleh tukar HL oil cleanser tu dengan Micellar Water. Lepas tu tiap malam before tidur boleh apply aloevera gel untuk soothing yang biji biji tu
9384 2018-09-04 04:36:44 Diamond pls oil
9385 2018-09-04 04:36:44 So do u want to discuss oil price or world class medical facility Kerala bosted on and challenged others??
9386 2018-09-04 04:36:21 Renewed pressure on peso and lira comes despite attempts by policymakers to support their currencies. Asian currencies further pressured by approaching deadline for public comment on new US tariffs on Chinese goods. Brent Oil prices trading above $78 per barrel
9387 2018-09-04 04:36:04 Blood is purified honey and urine  is pure olive oil . What pure man ! As pure as Zardari
9388 2018-09-04 04:35:32 Maybe ask the other oil producing countries why they put their oil on the 7000 tankers a day plying the oceans instead of refining it themselves. Could it be possible that countries want to refine it into products that their industry and citizens want?
9389 2018-09-04 04:35:03 His detractors are sure to make him the king by ranting Rahul 24*7 nothing on the skyrocketing oil prices 
9390 2018-09-04 04:34:54 The utter hypocrisy of SloMo! Head of a #corruptLNP puppet Govt controlled by #insidiousIPA / #PuppetMasterMurdoch, big oil, coal, gas, banking and other corporate interests. They are a criminal enterprise!
9391 2018-09-04 04:34:28  Huh?
Border with China is 1100 miles away from  Gwadar! Estimates put shipping of oil/gas via CPEC to Xinjiang economically unviable vs sea routes via Malacca. CPEC wont solve their dilema much as most of population is too far to the east to have any big benefit.
9392 2018-09-04 04:34:19 You'd have to ask them. I suspect it had something to do with social license. I'd be interested in hearing the current thinking from these mysterious CEOs of big oil. Maybe @dkennedyglans has some insight?
9393 2018-09-04 04:34:18 Well proper diet plays a big part in fresh looking skin but use toner to wipe off excess oil, any mild moistirizer will do. Cetaphil is one that I have used for years, it doesnt clog pores. Olay also has a daily moisturizer that is water based and very light.
9394 2018-09-04 04:34:04 I’m not sure if it will help... but other rodents HATE peppermint oil... few drops on cotton wool balls at the entrance to it’s lair...or thereabouts would do the trick with a mouse... good luck!
9395 2018-09-04 04:34:03 Flaky lips? Make your own lip scrub with sugar mixed with olive oil.
9396 2018-09-04 04:33:49 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

9403 2018-09-04 04:33:18 Had Mr. Sharjeel memon not any other bottle for honey and olive oil. If there was no alcohol in the bottles then someone had drunk them also.
9404 2018-09-04 04:33:17 I hope u convince dubai rulers to ask Gulf countries to increase production of crude oil so that Petrol Products rates can b lowered in India, like RG did otherwise?
9405 2018-09-04 04:33:08 Why cuz Trump hotel put the Saudi's up for a week in his hotel for a nice 'you bring my hotel into the black and I'll get oil from you?'  Remember how that worked out for you in 2001

9408 2018-09-04 04:32:37 Here is another one - can you cite a single academic source for your finding? One feels it is all made up as you go along. The 1973 Arab oil shock? What the heck does that have to do with the culture of eating beef? We have been doing this since the time of our ancestors.
9409 2018-09-04 04:32:25 National Oil is on standby.
9410 2018-09-04 04:32:24 True. These r really good schemes n hope they will really make favourable change in Rural India. Electrification is another feather in cap though most done by UPA.
Do u think, Huge devaluation of Rupee n huge oil price is opposition strategy or may b global situation responsible?
9411 2018-09-04 04:32:24 It could be what they call a bubble. It’s common with piercings I have it behind my second hole. Put tea tree oil on it and try not to mess with it because it won’t go away.

9422 2018-09-04 04:29:46 kalo menurutku face oil bisa masuk ke treatment atau cleansing. tergantung kandungannya *cmiiw
9423 2018-09-04 04:29:39 Yes on Prop 6 would remove this tax imposed on Californians by our state politicians. It doesn’t solve the greedy oil companies. However it’s time to send a message to our bought-off politicians.
9424 2018-09-04 04:29:35 わああありがとうございます
9425 2018-09-04 04:29:27 I think she inebriated a lot, having said that I do agree about scrapping carbon tax fiasco. However, it does not withstand previous government’ failure to diversify Alberta’ economy to have a portfolio not just based on oil and gas.
9426 2018-09-04 04:29:27 "hes loving, caring, but i dislike 'x' about him"

mmmmhmm. then dump him or live with it.
9427 2018-09-04 04:29:20 Oil Companys just make it up as they go...they claim its supply and demand but if you have  noticed prices goes up leaps and  bounds and goes down a penny at a time...BS
9428 2018-09-04 04:29:12 i know this is a hot take but maybe oil barrons shouldn’t decide when we go to war with countries that have oil reserves
9429 2018-09-04 04:29:08 #PetrolPriceHike . There is a pressure on oil prices due to decrease in production. &, global currencies have weakened against the US dollar
9430 2018-09-04 04:28:39 Hi, i ada nak let go HL oil cleanser. Ada lagi half bottle
9431 2018-09-04 04:28:28 Best about the pieceis that it finally appeared. Whenever we read of a guy making excuses, we may ask what he's excusing himself for. This, to me, is a plea for sympathy by one who hasn't faced up to what he did, or what he is charged with -- which may be different things.

9468 2018-09-04 04:22:05 It is the govt should cut down 10% import of crude oil to bring Rupee slide under control. Cut down price on petroleum products by Rs Three and put a moratorium on price escalation of petroleum products for 30 Days.
If required government can stop petrol sales on every Sunday.

9485 2018-09-04 04:19:28 That would be fine, but we are not talking crude fromAlberta but dilbit.  No Canadian refineries can process it.  One thing @ElizabethMay has said for years is that it should be processed in Alberta, creating jobs there.  But oil companies dont want to spend the money.

9497 2018-09-04 04:18:13 Honey it’s easy. Buy a box of brownie mix, dump in a bowl with eggs and water and possibly oil and then stir. Boom. In less than five mins you’ll know the joy we know.

9499 2018-09-04 04:18:04 Kenya extracts oil. Export the raw materials in order to import it again. What is going on? #AmLiveNTV @ntvkenya @debarlinea
9500 2018-09-04 04:17:50 We must curtail strategic metagenomics or improve underwater robots to sequester gravid oil reserves. Tell others!
9501 2018-09-04 04:17:45 No party has agitated against every day of price rise of petroleum product.government should help people by giving subsidy from their earning when the crude oil price had come to $40 /barrel.
9502 2018-09-04 04:17:44 Happy birthday Mark 
9503 2018-09-04 04:17:38 @dpradhanbjp At some point of time crude oil price is higher than current price during UPA tenure which didn't impacted normal people much. From past one year you are saying this is a short term crisis.Kindly let us know when this crisis will end?

9505 2018-09-04 04:17:25 What a senseless Tweet 
Oil prices are rising 
And the dollar as been rising 
U can't blame government and the last quarter GDP Growth Was At 8.2 Percent So That's Not Development?
9506 2018-09-04 04:17:16 Oh channeling unchecked creationist tropes is pretty much the limit of Bob's research efforts, meanwhile the actual geology is so damned interesting (and oil companies use it, not Flood Geology, because they do like making money & so rely on the true not the false)
9507 2018-09-04 04:17:12 You need to oil your beard with the blood of your enemies. I promise you, it will smell very different.

9524 2018-09-04 04:14:03 Someone once told me they wanted to dip me in hot oil!
9525 2018-09-04 04:14:01 No, that's impossible. Iran is now under Chinese & Russian umbrella & so is Turkey etc. It's over now & keepers keep the rest. Most probably ASEAN currency will be the first global setback as well as a shock to NATO. Oils now Shia/China/Russian hands with Asian countries with oil
9526 2018-09-04 04:13:56 What's the compulsions of India to purchase crude oil from America as they have stopped all the aids for IND? Purchase of S400 will remain under the carpet!?
9527 2018-09-04 04:13:34 At my home honey is in olive oil bottle and olives in a bowl. We are so backward

9531 2018-09-04 04:13:13 Wow, one person/1 party has the power to decide the global production of oil and determine the global price, very pleased to hear that ...
9532 2018-09-04 04:13:06 damn oil leak
9533 2018-09-04 04:12:53 our oil can't compete with Saudi prices. hence electric cars

9537 2018-09-04 04:12:21 U.S. oil prices rose on Tuesday, breaking past $70 per barrel, after two Gulf of Mexico oil platforms were evacuated in preparation for a hurricane.
9538 2018-09-04 04:12:11 Oops! Sorry Helena...he spent his taxpayer allowance this month bailing out a foreign oil corp who ended up holding the bag on a project when the price of oil crashed.

9543 2018-09-04 04:11:49 Spotify has banned payola for the data-as-oil narrative?
9544 2018-09-04 04:11:44 We know leaders in this country who have businesses in the energy sector, from oil to gas. They are happy about the 16% VAT. They won't say a word!
9545 2018-09-04 04:11:43 2/2 

Personal popularity and decency matter. But politics is about results and substance.

Q: what else in common?

A: “all of the above” energy policies repugnant to climate science - pretending that more oil & gas leasing & massive pipelines compatible with a livable planet.
9546 2018-09-04 04:11:34 Blue Cheese and Basalmic and oil more.
9547 2018-09-04 04:11:28 tea tree oil is a blessing
9548 2018-09-04 04:11:16 Can we keep Alaska for the oil and the yummy caribou?  Pretty please?
9549 2018-09-04 04:11:08 Canada exports crude oil. Price of petrol is ₹ 76 /litre. 

Global average price of petrol ₹114/litre.
9550 2018-09-04 04:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: undercooked crust with stale motor oil and shrimp.
9551 2018-09-04 04:11:06 When crude oil was reduced to 25$ a barrel Govt imposed huge taxes and didnot pass those benefits to people , now that crude oil price is increasing Govt should reduce their taxes.#PetrolPriceHike
9552 2018-09-04 04:10:57 Which flavor cannabis oil are you looking forward to trying the most?
9553 2018-09-04 04:10:45 Just becoz ... Govt. Bought 3rd class oil from America.. that becomes waste.. 

now oil marketing companies have to recover amount of Modi ji's government to government deal.
9554 2018-09-04 04:10:41 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

9563 2018-09-04 04:09:32 Of course, Venezuela has oil so neocons will be willing to invade...
9564 2018-09-04 04:08:55 激アツ
9565 2018-09-04 04:08:53 there is a way to evade but government must have desire. if they can come to us and talk about Gandak Barrage we must have talk about sharing Paradip deep sea port(on perpetual lease). Dependency of NOC on IOC is the biggest mistake rather government should import crude oil/gas.
9566 2018-09-04 04:08:36 New favorite salad: summer heirloom tomatoes, avocado, chopped jalapeño, crumbled Benton bacon, champagne vinegar, olive oil, salt n pepper.

9570 2018-09-04 04:07:59 Do you remember 2013's crude oil rates & corresponding petrol rates? 
Go check then comment
9571 2018-09-04 04:07:50 Not anti-TT, just pro-Guyana. Kamla: our first oil is not until 2020 and each party in the ExxonMobil discovery can market its own share of crude. GY has the right to choose a long-term deal with anyone. Usually crude tankers are marketed one by one on the spot market.
9572 2018-09-04 04:07:44 そういうのはやめてください笑笑
9573 2018-09-04 04:07:41 Oil massage

9576 2018-09-04 04:07:20 Our biggest export in coming years will be honey and olive oil. Sehat aur mazaa saath saath @Xadeejournalist @nadeemmalik
9577 2018-09-04 04:07:19 I think essential oils are way overhyped, but lavender oil in my shower tonight made me feel like I’ve never been stressed.
9578 2018-09-04 04:07:17 rubber, black pepper, palm oil. Are we still strong in those industries?
9579 2018-09-04 04:07:17 2/2 in your hand, if it's 8 hairs per try, then you dont need any treatment simple Nurture your hairs with Oil. If number of hairs are in more than 8 or even more, then you need to see, how healthy your hairs are first, if natural shining is there,then any oil can be use othrwise

9592 2018-09-04 04:04:55 What is happening to Nigerian oil is happening to its sugar. Nigeria has become a net importer of goods and if this is not stopped in time the repercussions on the Nigerian society will be horrendous. facilitate local production and manpower development.

9597 2018-09-04 04:04:10 Right...which is why they ultimately released him the first go round and didn't move his family to the US? But if your car constantly runs out of oil you don't keep filling it with oil...you hire someone to fix the problem
9598 2018-09-04 04:04:03 Boys and commitment are like oil and water lol
9599 2018-09-04 04:04:01 No man I’m a Pipeliner, I’m all for oil getting shipped to be exported for anything but western Canada select prices. If the tree huggers want it to go on the rail road track instead of a pipeline that’s on them. I’m just saying where it will end up getting shipped on.
9600 2018-09-04 04:03:56 And we’d not be importing oil from countries that produce it and ship it without emissions regulation. Nor supporting the despotic regimes that produce it.
9601 2018-09-04 04:03:49 Hmmmm. I'll be interested in seeing the results. I have the impression here in Colorado that it is snake oil. Touted as a cure for literally everything. I admit I'm a sceptic, and the over-reaching is not bringing me to the other side.
9602 2018-09-04 04:03:48 Listening to @BusyPhilipps describe getting 2 days of oil & tea enemas, 4 hands massages, and vagina steaming from this place is LA to “fix her sinuses”.

9610 2018-09-04 04:02:47 @smuckers Do you use certified sustainable palm oil in your products?
9611 2018-09-04 04:02:46 It's not only question that who managed oil prices well? Why don't we take in account the subsidies paid in UPA on petroleum products and in present regime. Any product can be made cheaper by providing subsidies. But ultimately it make hole in AAM AADMI. Choice is yours.
9612 2018-09-04 04:02:46 frozen stir fry veggies! they come in a bag all cut up and with the good ones! i throw em in a pan with some oil and whatever dressing you want (i usually use hoisin sauce and some spices) and i’ll add the gardein orange vegan “chikn” and maybe some rice! takes like 15 min tops
9613 2018-09-04 04:02:43 I agree with what you’re saying, but leave the Genesis and SNES out of this. Say what you want about the 3DO, Jaguar and the Virtua Boy. Leave the MS/Genesis and NES/SNES alone lol

9633 2018-09-04 04:00:12 @pdavidy8 my friends’ daughter put coconut oil in her hair tonight. I thought of you. Lol
9634 2018-09-04 04:00:10 Do you know the normal price of international crude oil ??

9637 2018-09-04 03:59:44 Interesting...Soros is heavy in the African Diamond & oil industries. Also, he's responsible for the resignation of ANC President Zuma.
Why doesn't CNN cover stories like this, pray tell?
9638 2018-09-04 03:59:39 The amount of gas and oil I spend on this truck is like a car payment tbh lol
9639 2018-09-04 03:59:33 I usually keep fresh spinach in my fridge so when I’m feeling lazy I’ll sauté some garlic and spinachin olive oil, mix it with pasta and call it a night.
9640 2018-09-04 03:59:10 During UPA 1, crude prices ranged from $37-$53, except in 2008 when it touched $91.  When oil hit $91, gdp growth declined sharply from 9’s to 6’s.
9641 2018-09-04 03:59:08 Please do tell us Elizabeth what you would do differently? I am curious. Cut Alberta's resources out from under them and I am no lover of oil. Keep the old leaking lines? Sorry, I do find this very self serving as well & I have always been a fan of yours.

9643 2018-09-04 03:58:56 Because they are leftists. leftists have a long long history of running businesses into the ground once they have gained control. look at the Venezuelan oil fields. they promote Cronies instead of talent and run the business based on politics over profit.

9645 2018-09-04 03:58:43 No, mostly they think I should be boiled in oil.
9646 2018-09-04 03:58:32 Are you one of those BC hypocrites who is fine with Saudi and Trump’s oil and ok with shipping millions of tones of coal and ok with billions of litres of raw sewage but say no to a pipeline.
9647 2018-09-04 03:58:29 Very prompt services by Indian Oil for booking, supply& subsidies for domestic LPG.,
9648 2018-09-04 03:58:22 Man, crude is taken out of a well in your neighbourhood. Cong-I slept on oil exhortation for years. Crude import was a way for Cong-I to make money through commission. Every Cong-I ministry made money including you, unscrupulous fellow.

9650 2018-09-04 03:58:02 Seldom in this world nicer than a long bath, shaving, exfoliating, lathering yourself up in coconut oil like butterball turkey, full facial care routine, slapping on some white strips and snuggling with your cat. Only downside: siping wine through a straw cuz of the white strips
9651 2018-09-04 03:58:00 From dinner, consuming more grass fed meat, free range eggs, a cup of mixed above ground veggies stir fried in coconut oil, turmeric, ginger, garlic, red onions, black & Cayenne pepper n Nigella seeds.. wow I can go the next day not hungry ...
9652 2018-09-04 03:57:55 Tindakan dari pemerintah melalui programnya yaitu B20, mengajak kita serta vendor-vendor oil & gas untuk memberdayakan sumber daya alam. SDA kan buanyakkk? yang mana dong?

9658 2018-09-04 03:57:10 I like this GIF.  I paint oil figure and landscape.  I wanted to do sculpture but lost an argument with polymer clay.
9659 2018-09-04 03:57:10 All we have to do is respect oil & gas enough to have the prices go up either by restricted supply, carbon taxing, or decreased demand due to electrification. Or “all of the above”. Stop wasting it out our tail pipes. Conservation

9665 2018-09-04 03:56:27 His campaign website last time around was all about him in the desert managing oil wells. I might have voted for him if I wanted an oil well at the riverforks.
9666 2018-09-04 03:56:15 Maybe US regional allies have got no problem with Iran regional activities. Maybe it’s not about Iran access to USD, it’s about pushing Iran out of energy market and keeping funds away from Iran oil and gas industry. They fueled regional conflicts, and now it’s time to harvest…

9672 2018-09-04 03:55:30 Yep. Solar industry is thriving because oil and gas power the machines to make the solar panels! #iamcoloradooilandgas

9674 2018-09-04 03:55:18 Venezuela,  US selling us our own oil they buy at a discount and oil from who knows. Tar is a manufactured product, it's not naturally occurring.  Is the planet hurt less by other less ethical woman abusing countries oil projects who deliver across oceans?
9675 2018-09-04 03:55:18 Ahistoric? I'd say brief. Oil crisis? That occurred under Nixon, Ford, Carter wage and price controls. When it ended, the crisis ended. Deregulation? There was no significant deregulation. Taxes on 1%?

In any case natural gas is fossil fuel   n basically we need to get to neg emissions asap so it pointless expanding sector. Must contract asap.
9678 2018-09-04 03:54:11 Oil Refinery workers essentially became the equivalent to Coal Miners in America, and the opposition party will undoubtedly use it as a talking piece in the near to distant future.

Moreover compare NDA handover economy to UPA in 2005 to UPA to NDA in 2014 says it all
9686 2018-09-04 03:52:23 your point is a counterpoint to the same bullshit I can't stand. instead of getting anywhere everybody is playing to outrage and stereotype. if we start to break down the ideologies and tribalism, maybe we can communicate enough to find common cause and useful compromises.
9687 2018-09-04 03:52:05 You have coconut oil ? I’ve used coconut oil and warm towel and just let it sit they’ll eventually come off

9690 2018-09-04 03:51:07 I go by the contribution to CPI which is readily available. A big factor is rice prices, followed by transpo. Why are we more sensitive than others in ASEAN? You'd have to take into account how much oil they import or produce and whether they have an oil price stabilisation fund

9695 2018-09-04 03:50:23 Hindus in Kerala afaik generally avoided eating beef until the 1970s. After that beef eating was 'normalized' as modern, progressive and fashionably anti Hindu. Coincided with Christian takeover of education and 1973 Arab oil shock, petro dollar infusion, gulf migration
9696 2018-09-04 03:50:16 A good list but in the name of fairness, should include the negatives. The biggest is DeMon. Done by the PM himself, no clear idea of the base problem, no targets, shitty implementation. Dealt a mortal blow to an economy that shd have rocketed with decade low oil prices

9714 2018-09-04 03:47:39 Did you know TransMountain and expansion are one of the only pipelines in NorthAmerica that can ship refined oil products? And by 2020 they can ship the cleaner bunker fuel for heavy emitting ships and help to reduce their pollution. Two refineries in Alberta can produce it.

9769 2018-09-04 03:41:05 So you would rather have a proven conceited bunch who had decidedly regressed the country take control of the future than accept that oil prices are driven by factors beyond any political party's control?Cutting off the nose the spite the face?

9804 2018-09-04 03:37:01 sorry for more about prop 2..BUT..some facts everyone should know:

1 utah already legalized CBD oil in 2014

2 prop 2 is legalization of full plant medical use

3 700+ health issues can be helped

4 medical use of pot is specific for everyone. ie smoke, oil, ingest

5 vote yes
9805 2018-09-04 03:36:52 So I took some CBD oil and a nice long nap and OMG! I had such gorgeous dreams of beautiful places! I feel stupendous! I really like this stuff!
9806 2018-09-04 03:36:48 I live in BC. I'm originally from Vancouver, and the idea of taking a pay cut and using half or more of what's left for rent is unattractive.

9830 2018-09-04 03:31:53 This reaonates with me.  My 9yo and I are like oil and water so often because we are so alike. It is in quiet alone time that we bond the most.
9831 2018-09-04 03:31:41 I just use argan oil conditioner and cold water and it's pretty much good. I don't blow dry, straighten, or curl it so no heat like ever. It's not really that damaged probably because I don't upkeep the bleach or color besides some dye in my conditioner once a week.
9832 2018-09-04 03:31:33 Andrew Scheer doesn’t get it. The best way to reduce global emissions is to not produce emissions. Reliance on the oil industry is foolishness.

9905 2018-09-04 03:20:43 Especially given tha a righ5 wing government in BC has 16 years to pull off a deal. Just like thefiscally conservative parties in Alberta bet the farm on the oil sands only to see it crumble in a world downturn (and then pillaged the Heritage fund).
9906 2018-09-04 03:20:36 Melaleuca oil works the best!!!!
9907 2018-09-04 03:20:27 more expensive. We've used up most of the world's easy to use oil. Now we are making oil out of tar sands. This is more expensive and pollutes even more. And fossil fuels just aren't a renewable resource. No matter what happens, we'll run out.
9908 2018-09-04 03:20:26 Today's update on oil prices
Petrol up by 16 paise 
Diesel up by 19 paise only! 
Will update you all on the dollar rupee front in a while.
9909 2018-09-04 03:20:14 Yes, agree the protest is meaningless. You redirect positively, great. I’d like to see the right stop being stupid with this keurig bullshit and instead have oil, banks, defense, etc stop playing a double game and secretly donating to DNC for political favors as a pure bribe.
9910 2018-09-04 03:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

9919 2018-09-04 03:18:54 I put coconut oil and mix it up and it literally saved my pomade.
9920 2018-09-04 03:18:28 Literally the only self care I've done this summer is pluck my eyebrows once and get my car's oil changed :o)
9921 2018-09-04 03:18:27 Oh my. 

Spring onion, garlic, olive oil, linguine and a bit of Pecorino Romano are having an orgy in my mouth right now.
9922 2018-09-04 03:18:25 Eucalyptus and Lavender Oil tonight
9923 2018-09-04 03:18:24 ‘Big oil’ is such a pathetic term for an industry that feeds hundreds of thousands of Canadians. 

Whereas the well funded ‘Enviro-Nazis’ would rather see unemployment skyrocket as our social programs waste away. Energy funds Canada.
9924 2018-09-04 03:18:21 Its about time   we already have the Pipe line and started drilling here in America  Open up oil wells in Alaska   We are now the biggest suppler in the world   The Oil Company's  are greedy  we should be paying $105.9  a gallon

9931 2018-09-04 03:17:53 "Must be the perfume made for me." She said, sitting up and flicking open the vial of oil to coat her hands with it.
9932 2018-09-04 03:17:37 zardari mafias succeeded to dodge the supreme court of Pakistan in SHARGEEL  MAMOON criminal case  and magically converted wine into olive oil and honey
9933 2018-09-04 03:17:27 Sad about what Duterte is doing to Trillianes. Oppression at its finest. Traffic still there, prices of oil & goods still high, drugs and the 6.7b still at large and many more. I love hoping better for this country but how? Duterte please stop.
9934 2018-09-04 03:17:27 Newsflash: Canada has zero control over how much oil is consumed globally. And that consumption is growing each year.
9935 2018-09-04 03:17:09 Union movement? Give me a break. It’s supply and demand my friend. Ppl in demand make more money. When I worked offshore oil and gas (non union) I made more than working on land doing about the same work protected by the union.
9936 2018-09-04 03:17:01 So wrong Amin. We know that the OilSands are one of the most environmentally destructive types of oil on earth and that the oils going to China from here via the Trans Mountain will push the planet into an advanced state of  global warming pushing us  over the edge of destruction
9937 2018-09-04 03:16:50 FSU and Miami have a couple things in common... there from Florida and there both overrated!
9938 2018-09-04 03:16:45 Doc wanted me to use Vitamin E oil instead of Almond oil.
No idea why.

I now however, have a rash ON MY INCISION AREA. 

Either that or there is an infection. Not thinking it's that tbh. 

I'm pretty put out.
9939 2018-09-04 03:16:42 Wow I totally forgot about the coconut oil I spilled on the floor.
9940 2018-09-04 03:16:29 A political party using dead people to push agendas?  What do the libs do EVERY time there is a shooting??  Must I remind you of Orlando, used every dead person there for their agenda.  And Vegas, let's not even talk about the children at Sandy Hook politicized for an agenda!
9941 2018-09-04 03:16:12 Government is. The oil minister has made this statement repeatedly. Thing is how will this statement reach people? Through media. And the media being pro-Congress will never play this.
9942 2018-09-04 03:16:03 No mames ! Ese gol de todos modos condiciona el partido y le da otro giro a la estrategia del Veracruz aún cuando se supone que cruz azul era el favorito. Pero váyanse preparando para una de las #CruzAzuleadas más épicas de la historia !

9944 2018-09-04 03:15:58 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
9945 2018-09-04 03:15:55 The intent is not to spill oil. That costs money. We can be sure no oil company wants to clean up oil they could have sold.

9969 2018-09-04 03:13:05 Again with this! You stated clearly that 20% of EE capacity was to stay in Canada. That's 200K bpd. Enough to replace Saudi oil.
But, as always, you place other countries before Canada.

9982 2018-09-04 03:11:09 We had to really figure things out when work slowed down a few years back. Focused on paying down debt and not wasting money. Someone should teach a course on this stuff when a guy gets his first job in the oil patch
9983 2018-09-04 03:10:54 You resort to name calling and rants when someone calls you on your nonsense. Might I suggest some lavender oil or chamomile because you obviously need to chill out.

9986 2018-09-04 03:10:42 A small increase that doesn’t rise with inflation is not benefiting the average worker. Housing, oil, food resources have all gone up while salaries virtually haven’t. Which is why I said raises have been stagnant especially compared to CEO’s.

9990 2018-09-04 03:10:15 It is always a good idea to step away from twitter for a while.  Always a good idea, especially when theSJW hate mobs are throwing a tantrum.  It gets noisy, and no amount of oil will fix what it rusted and breaking.  Still we stand, as always to endure it together.

9992 2018-09-04 03:09:59 My wife and I went to the 'Oil Barron's Ball' in 1990. The company I worked for in the oilfield invited us. She hired a ball gown and I hired a brand new Italian tux. I thought I looked liked Bond. People kept asking me "Where are the toilets?" They thought I was a bouncer!
9993 2018-09-04 03:09:57 CBN now questions usefulness of demonetization! He was the person who egged on NAMO to ban the high value notes in order to weaken his opponent Party and claimed credit for the move also! He should also know that oil prices and rupee weakening are not in the hands of central govt

9996 2018-09-04 03:09:42 Congress took loans through oil bonds to the tune of Rs 1.44 lakh crore. This amount along with an interest of Rs 70,000 crore was paid by the Modi government. This is again an example of how Congress ruins while BJP repairs yet all the abuse is hurled at the BJP.
