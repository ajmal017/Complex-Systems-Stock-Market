40 2018-11-06 23:57:33 Its not "ancient history" when our oil is landlocked and we are losing $100 million per day because of this and the failure in the past 3 years to defend our energy sector.  This is current economic pain, not "ancient history. "
41 2018-11-06 23:57:31 The mall no a Dr. visit no Starbucks no oil change.

44 2018-11-06 23:57:01 Is it just me or is it beginning to smell like snake oil in Flushing?
45 2018-11-06 23:57:01 Fracking is a issue thoe, it’s drying up the land we live on. The production of glass and oil come from gases and oil. The farmers did it for over a hundred years with no problems with the environment. Now global warming exist , Why continue it ? It pollutes the air.
46 2018-11-06 23:56:59 I could see the pun there, but it’s doesn’t really work. P.Maroon was a good contributor throughout his time with the Oil.
47 2018-11-06 23:56:53 Oh you were talking about a solution? A solution would be a pin # & your phone +mail-in ballot for absolute Verification. It Would be saving gas, oil, time, tons of paper and pens, time off, etc.

51 2018-11-06 23:56:15 A playground can’t have an oil derrick AND a hamster wheel.  You have to compromise.
52 2018-11-06 23:56:13 I don’t use my car insurance to pay for an oil change or to get new tires.  Or even if I need a new transmission.  And not surprisingly, cars are still affordable, like things the government doesn’t subsidize.

Anointing was a symbolic act to indicate YAH choosing

65 2018-11-06 23:54:27 So I just found out that using a facial oil reduces oily skin?!?! What?! This is information I needed 8 years ago

68 2018-11-06 23:53:55 3.9% uemployment is the lowest in 10 years since GFC this has led to a rise in the NZD against USD we know crude oil prices have been falling we expect a petrol price fall at the pump as there is no change in RPT or excise tax changes which have already been implemented

74 2018-11-06 23:52:56 In ancient Yahrushaylem, when someone was given a position of authority, oil was poured on his head to signify his being set apart for ELOHYIM service

87 2018-11-06 23:51:45 What I'm finding is making the complete meal (veg, protein, grain, root) is working better than separating. What I'm finding is it has to be the right combination of those types of foods. I.E. broccoli, beef, rice, ginger - with olive oil. The sulfur neutralizes the cyanide comp

93 2018-11-06 23:50:56 The earth is "at risk" (read: doomed) no matter who is in government. Big oil was running rampant even when democrats were in control of the government. The fact that you think this is something your vote can influence makes me wonder if we're living on the same planet.
94 2018-11-06 23:50:44 How’s that going to work when there is an @EdmOilKings game on the 6th??  No disrespect meant to Justin but I’d rather watch the Oil Kings. 
95 2018-11-06 23:50:17 Do you know someone who smokes & wants to quit? Here's an essential oil recipe that has worked for many people: Quit Sticks. Also, the Kick the Habit inhaler when the urge comes up. #quitsmoking
96 2018-11-06 23:50:07 Most of these, Mika/Joe, Allison/Cuomo are not experts in anything. That goes for some talking heads at Fox as well. In reality their opinion and the info they spread is worth nothing.

98 2018-11-06 23:49:46 We've been sampling #protein bars from @fitjoynutrition. We've tried Cookie Dough Brownie & Cookies & Cream. Both appeal to those who like bars very sweet, candy bar style.

103 2018-11-06 23:49:19 JESUS! JESUS! JESUS!  Study pure THC oil if you can use "the right to try."  It is curing stage 4 cancers.  There are also You Tube videos on the subject.  Feed the blood, blood sustains life!  God bless you dear patriot!  (((WWG1WGA)))
104 2018-11-06 23:49:19 Black castor oil! Shea moisture has a lot of really good products for dry scalp. Another big issue could be shampooing too often
105 2018-11-06 23:49:13 You only need oil, like coconut oil or oil cleanser for your face.
106 2018-11-06 23:49:09 i only came to the dealership to get an oil chang and my tires rotated and they tryna tell me i need to get my wipers and cabin air filter changed as well ! they're really trying to finesse

110 2018-11-06 23:48:48 A few drops of Lemongrass essential oil and eucalyptus essential oil, mixed with water and witch hazel is what I use as a personal spray you can also add citronella essential oil. Skin so soft has some not so nice ingredients in it.
111 2018-11-06 23:48:43 Just watched a guy make a serious financial decision... a quart of oil for his truck or a pack of smokes? He went for the pack of smokes 
112 2018-11-06 23:48:20 I saw something about it looking like 112 and 74 could pass, but don't recall what the source was. There were so many commercials that made 74 look reasonable -- guess they can afford it with all that sweet oil & gas money.

133 2018-11-06 23:44:57 Will be tough if we continue to depend on oil exports, and imports for domestic consumption in the presence of grand and bureaucratic corruption.

142 2018-11-06 23:43:55 Ah, I misread your original comment and thought you meant investing in oil field services (ofs).

148 2018-11-06 23:43:01 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
149 2018-11-06 23:43:01 Real ignorance is not admitting how pointless it is to do your own oil changes these days. Not only is it just as cheap, but most decent shops warranty an oil change and will pay for a new engine if something were to happen.
150 2018-11-06 23:42:53 Point 2- Next OIL REFINERIES. These use Abserloutely staggering amounts of power, as much as a small town just to convert from into petrol. Far more than is needed to make batteries etc needed for EVs.
151 2018-11-06 23:42:44 Maybe that was real play of @realDonaldTrump the Snake Oil Salesman ! Remember the 3 card trip street game players used to play & still do now. That's #Trump all over. He is a con man and a plastic Don at that ! #JustSaying He was only ever after the #Senate ! That was his gamble
152 2018-11-06 23:42:39 Point 1 - Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then petrol goes in huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car.
153 2018-11-06 23:42:21 Petition for drivers ed to include demonstrations on how to jump start a car, fill the coolant, and check the oil. Or it should be on the test.
154 2018-11-06 23:42:16 WAR ECONOMY ALL THE WAY BABY!I got these 5 year plans. Focusing on our big bois coal, steel, oil and electricity. Screw light engineering, we gotta get all of our stuff together! We industrializing. Who cares dude... keep the workers down. We got this! #allforone

158 2018-11-06 23:41:23 The amount of oil that ends up in my hair when I wash it is so unnecessary but I can't help it
159 2018-11-06 23:41:04 soybeans contain a small amount of arachidic acid, i.e., spider oil
160 2018-11-06 23:40:58 Don't make me paranoid I hope I did sjsjsjxjsjsjs there was 4 things with a lid, break fluid, engine oil, windscreen thing and coolant so it had to be the right one
161 2018-11-06 23:40:49 Most illuminating conversation with my ex-neighbour this morning. He's a major engineer with Oil & Gas exploration, as in he owns a major company providing consulting & engineering services in the sector.

166 2018-11-06 23:40:37 I'm the wrong person to ask.. I watch the currency pair because by all rights our dollar should be near a record low.  SOMETHING is keeping it high against the USD.
I just wonder what promises are being made in exchange for this. Refugees, maybe? Something to do w our oil price?

175 2018-11-06 23:39:11 So I love good skincare cleanser s. Face Mask and I like a body oil. And relaxing . Zen

178 2018-11-06 23:38:52 I'm cutting sugar again too and for some reason I get extreme anxiety. However if I put sugar free gum in that is super sweet and suck on it for a little bit it helps my cravings. Also oil pulling has helped me too. Sounds crazy but it works.
179 2018-11-06 23:38:48 I would agree if it was benign. Unfortunately snake oil is quite damaging to the whole subject and it's purpose. If Gaia didn't slam it in my face daily, I wouldn't respond...

187 2018-11-06 23:37:51 The day after the 2016 election I was in a Honda dealership in tears while waiting for my oil to get changed. Tomorrow I head to Costco to get my tires changed. Why do I keep scheduling car appointments the day after elections? #hopingfornotears #Midterms2018
188 2018-11-06 23:37:51 It's cheap with my co-pays, so I've been stockpiling for the apocalypse. CBD oil also does the trick. And no hangover! But gin is also mighty effective.
189 2018-11-06 23:37:44 Almost said something gross? Lol. Well, why didn’t you? Some of us thrive on “gross”. Just sayin.
190 2018-11-06 23:37:41 Best part about early Oil games is getting to listen to @DuckMillard on my way home TWO days in a row!
191 2018-11-06 23:37:40 Tbh, I’m not completely sure of the exact medical benefits but I think it helps with circulation in the breast tissue. You massage the oil in and it helps lift/ make them perky.
192 2018-11-06 23:37:35 I don't eat the food. I am using old canned food,
the ends of carrots, red cabbage ends, et al
I drain it, oil it & bake it long and hard on parchment paper til it
burns impressions in the paper.
Then, remove from oven. Remove the veggies/fruit and see what patterns
they made.

196 2018-11-06 23:37:09 @my_ecoegg I use white vinegar and a drop of lavender essential oil in my fabric softener draw instead of conventional fabric softener that is full of chemicals but I’ve noticed the eco egg has stopped producing foam and the wash quality is bad could the vinegar be the cause ?thx
197 2018-11-06 23:37:07 Use a little bit of oil maybe?

200 2018-11-06 23:36:53 I really thought that was olive oil at first glance
201 2018-11-06 23:36:37 You are sayin our players running away and doing this sacred oil balance. Time to erase my hm16 char. You dont care your customers. cya then.
202 2018-11-06 23:36:25 I almost said something gross. See im growing up..i back spaced

209 2018-11-06 23:35:24 I finally changed my car oil, cleaned the inside, and got gas. Who said girls don’t take care of their car??
210 2018-11-06 23:35:24 What is groundnut oil beans???
211 2018-11-06 23:35:15 Your cousin should buy lottery tickets.
212 2018-11-06 23:35:11 The flash frying is amazing. But at home you can toss them in olive oil and put them in a really hot oven. We put zatar (herb mix common in Middle East) on top of them. Enjoy!!!
213 2018-11-06 23:35:01 Something has to be done. I’m all against most regulations but dear Lord, Google , FB, Twitter & Instagram controls the web. They are colluding in elections. Much more damage than the oil companies ever dreamed of doing.
214 2018-11-06 23:35:00 ..-closing two tax loopholes that allow the wealthy to avoid taxes on money they inherit.
-stopping taxpayer-funded giveaways to oil, gas and coal companies
215 2018-11-06 23:34:59 Indeed especially the oil and weapons companies

218 2018-11-06 23:34:42 Hah. When oil prices rise, gas prices rise. When oil prices drop, oil barons buy a fifteenth yacht off the backs of America workers.
219 2018-11-06 23:34:37 She is wrong. I suspect you know this too, but facts and truth  and integrity matter not to a campaign funded by liars and snake oil salesmen.
220 2018-11-06 23:34:32 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
221 2018-11-06 23:34:30 This oil rebalance is utter shit. Why the fuck do we still need Demon Spirit Stones, something that doesn't exist? Why are evo stones still nowhere to be found? If you do not intend to decrease the prices, at least provide more ways to farm the damn item.

225 2018-11-06 23:34:04 Regardless of tonight's results I just want everyone to know Scott Walker is a trash human being held together by raw sewage and snake oil. That is all
226 2018-11-06 23:33:59 Cheaper is always better. Foreign oil till they run out, then maybe tar sands oil, maybe.
227 2018-11-06 23:33:47 I called the Autoplex to schedule my oil change and Just my luck I get Shelbi
228 2018-11-06 23:33:42 If trump goes, people are assuming the trade war will stop. What they are forgetting is that Government is a continuous body. It can’t abruptly change anything just because the seat of President is occupied by a different person.

I think the current turn is because of oil
229 2018-11-06 23:33:33 今日は病院行って胃カメラの予約取らなきゃなぁ～。前回みたいに異常なしだったらいいんだけど胸焼けが酷いのが気になるしな。

246 2018-11-06 23:31:47 Have you tried pure vitamin E oil? I had the same issue
247 2018-11-06 23:31:41 they had the quick fry crispy doofers that you dropped in hot oil for 5 or 6 secs, complete waste of energy but CRUNCH! Unless you left them in for 7-8 secs in which case they could break glass and teeth.

271 2018-11-06 23:29:20 Well, considering Obama allowed more oil and gas to be taken from the ground than any president before him, I'd say your meme is useless.
272 2018-11-06 23:29:19 I voted, got an oil change, and washed my car today. Now I’m just trying to convince my boyfriend that I want tacos and a movie.

277 2018-11-06 23:28:34 Can someone tell me what a “clean job” is? I’m guessing because I work in Oil & Gas my job doesn’t qualify under #climatebarbie’s definition.
278 2018-11-06 23:28:24 Nice.  Made that last night on the Weber kettle.  Put dill and lemon on the salmon and wrapped it in foil.  Put walnuts and walnut oil on sprouts, put it all in a foil boat and roasted them. Perfection!
279 2018-11-06 23:28:17 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ

284 2018-11-06 23:28:00 Why not just cook it in the oven or a roasting pan? Tastes good, more safe and the other way you've got to get rid of a ton of oil, and the turkey will smell greasy. Not for me.

289 2018-11-06 23:27:30 1. Nope..they're afraid of sanctions...Magninsky...drop in oil price (which Obama did as revenge IMO). In sum, they are afraid of the many many ways that a Dem administration or Congress could punish them for meddling. Like Osama Bin Laden they were stupid. They engaged in a BIG

292 2018-11-06 23:27:02 Oh god I hate that brand. 

If you’re willing to give it another shot, try The Ordinary’s marula oil. $9 a bottle.

301 2018-11-06 23:26:01 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ

306 2018-11-06 23:25:29 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

308 2018-11-06 23:25:04 You are a huckster & snake oil salesman just like tRump, you preach what others should be doing while raking in money for your own personal benefit. I wouldn't trust you if you were the last preacher on earth. Your moral compass went South a long time ago.
309 2018-11-06 23:24:58 And it pulls me back into the daaaarrrrrrkkkkk
310 2018-11-06 23:24:57 When tRump first took office he use to have meeting with corporate CEOs or their Representatives. What do you think they talked about? Now they can create more jobs not!!! About what regulations they want gone. What areas they want opened up for coal mining or oil drilling and
311 2018-11-06 23:24:39 Thank you Walmart for taking 1000 years to give my girlfriends car an oil change.
312 2018-11-06 23:24:33 Funny how Liverpool talk about their atmosphere giving them the edge at home then their arses go when faced with an even more hostile atmosphere! Someone get the sheik on the phone and buy us some of these guys with our oil money

316 2018-11-06 23:23:47 Are you serious with this shit?  Really?

Who cares if the voters teach at university or work in the oil fields?

We don’t vote based on pedigree or education, we elect based on our cultural values. 

Some of us simple folk still desire small government, low taxes, and civility.

335 2018-11-06 23:21:27 Going to get busy with supper prep in a bit. Roasted potatoes, carrots, onions and red bell peppers. Black pepper and olive oil. Might splash a little balsamic vinegar on to finish, might not.
336 2018-11-06 23:21:18 @PJsPub let's not continue to cook with burnt cooking oil.
337 2018-11-06 23:21:14 They've missed that a lot of the meth problem is white kids (a lot of them coming back from the oil patch) and that a lot of the drug addiction among the indigenous population is driven by racism in the first place. 2/2
338 2018-11-06 23:21:07 I’m glad I didn’t leave my truck running @PopeyesChicken I would have needed an oil change by the time I got out

341 2018-11-06 23:20:48 The USA needs to stop putting guns in anyone's hand unless they are US military and the police. We have to stop assisting those wanting to wage war, even if it's undeclared. We used to need Saudi oil but we could just use ours & Canada's. We need to stop MSB b4 its too late.

344 2018-11-06 23:20:38 That and a giant jug of peanut oil. And a good spice rub. I’d still set up outside because of the smell.

346 2018-11-06 23:20:19 We left just before the oil boom but I still have friends there so go back - it’s quite different .... Inverness was just a little town really when I lived there and there was no bridge of course
347 2018-11-06 23:20:19 Fried cubanelle peppers in good olive oil, like an aromatico, with some sea salt and red pepper flakes on Italian bread.
They’re like candy.
348 2018-11-06 23:20:18 Roasted Brussels sprouts are the best! A little olive oil and salt- yum

365 2018-11-06 23:18:38 Interesting how oil went from soaring to getting killed just in time for the mid-term elections. Oil goes higher from here.
366 2018-11-06 23:18:35 Tip 649: Respect the boom. Sailing boom, sonic boom, oil boom; doesn’t matter. Respect it.

378 2018-11-06 23:17:43 Agreed. Starting around page 34, it says specifically that all of the entities involved can pass the cost of implementing the initiative on to consumers. That's not making "Big Oil" pay. It's making them add administrative costs on so that WE pay. Soda tax needs to go away.
379 2018-11-06 23:17:36 @bossivic If you like $IVZ check out $RMP also. It has a monster 400mmbbl oil prospect for which it is going to drill in Feb 2019. Dual listed in London & starting to move. EV 12m at the moment. Should get close to 100m EV upon drilling commencement
380 2018-11-06 23:17:31 Ha! Did the same thing a few weeks before getting married - was horrified with how unnatural they looked and spent hours rubbing them woefully with oil in the hope they’d fall off. No such luck: got ‘em removed the next day.
381 2018-11-06 23:17:29 Lovely area over there. We were in Invergorden just as the oil boom hit.

389 2018-11-06 23:16:31 Lol... Now you are just being ludicrous. Cars aren't perfect it's going to take a long time to find alternatives to all oil products but that doesn't make EV even close to as bad as petrol. Absolute worst case they are moving pollution out of our cities.

407 2018-11-06 23:15:16 YES. This has been a revelation to me, too, especially as I’ve reached middle age. Oil cleansers/makeup removers & oil moisturizers did the same for my skin, too. [heavenly choir sings]

443 2018-11-06 23:12:38 Depending on how it’s treated, with leather you can usually use some mink oil or a leather dressing and work it in to soften the boot
444 2018-11-06 23:12:34 Geez, you're right. I can smell the cooking oil from here. Kid's an absolute unit

446 2018-11-06 23:12:22 Try to make it seem like you need something else besides an oil change
447 2018-11-06 23:12:17 Saw a Beto pin on a young woman in the NYC Subway yesterday. Can you imagine pinning your hopes and dreams on some guy you never heard of 3 months ago. Ridiculous.
448 2018-11-06 23:12:06 Nope just like little creamy potatoes. I crisp them with olive oil and fresh herbs on the skillet and then pressure cook in the instant pot
449 2018-11-06 23:12:03 I never thought I would say it but I am HIGH on CBD oil

460 2018-11-06 23:10:35 I’m the big dummy &took drops of pure tea tree oil & applied it on my neck cause it smelled good. Yes it’s my fault sigh. I didn’t realize it was so potent. Next thing welts and hives and rashes started to spread all over my chest, neck, and face. I will never do this again
461 2018-11-06 23:10:32 Oh for sure. Unless they allow crazy financial backing in the different leagues.. which most fans despise. You can tell how it would change things though.. all that oil money and TV money has made it harder for a team like Madrid to just buy whoever they want.
462 2018-11-06 23:10:30 Im gonna start cooking with avacado oil more often 
463 2018-11-06 23:10:24 @CassandraYoung hey Cassie, heard you on the air about the pimple..tea tree oil works WONDERS. Dab it on a couple of times a day and you should see results almost immediately. Good luck & happy wedding week!!

470 2018-11-06 23:09:49 Try olive oil, not the one you use for food tho lol. I found mine at Walmart with all the shampoos, I love it! Tbh I think it makes a difference
471 2018-11-06 23:09:47 my most surprising skin care trick is… putting oil on my face. yes, actual oil. straight-up. 

it turns out that oil-free skin products force your skin to over-produce sebum to compensate, so ironically, ADDING oil to your skin makes it LESS oily

475 2018-11-06 23:09:13 Yeah. Getting the process down. Just need to use lower heat on the oil and cook'em a bit longer!

501 2018-11-06 23:06:19 After the 79’ revolution,Iran restored their democratic system,nationalized their oil fields and kicked out the British and Americans that occupied the oil fields.Theirs actually women that supported the Hijab,so it wasn’t forced upon the women.
502 2018-11-06 23:06:17 NS has regulated price at the pumps.  If oil goes up, prices go up. When oil goes down the gas price at the pumps remain the same

506 2018-11-06 23:05:58 Shoot...apprently I didn't get enough oil for my car. I think I'll go have it changed by a mechanic. Apparently it's cheaper that way.
507 2018-11-06 23:05:52 If your skin is well-hydrated it doesn’t over-produce oil.

589 2018-11-06 22:58:16 Its really not that hard too tbh, we just need to stop generalizing the haters as being one whole fandom or the other & treat each other with humility & respect instead of adding oil to the fire. Its not hard to think twice b4 lashing out at someone & to open-mindedly talk it out

612 2018-11-06 22:56:37 Precisely. Wage stagnation versus full employment with workers choosing their terms are mutually incompatible, like oil and water. Clearly it's ~20% unemployment with those forced to leave the labour market or part time or zero hours keeping demand up for food banks.

635 2018-11-06 22:54:09 Do you know that Republicans plan to make America like Venezuela too. Their use of oil is what caused their Country to crash and it might as well happen here as well if we don't vote Blue. It wasn't finance that cause Venezuela to crash, it was oil.

664 2018-11-06 22:50:52 There was so much noise about deregulation policy and development of other critical sectors of the economy during the period of recession. The momentum has however nosedived as a result of hike in the crude oil price. Over dependence on oil revenue is the bane of national growth.

719 2018-11-06 22:45:33 That's pretty sensitive. You'll have to extract the oil if you want to get high on it, I guess.
720 2018-11-06 22:45:23 There are colonies of tiny mites living on your face, feasting on the oil that comes out of your pores.

722 2018-11-06 22:44:54 Tip: Cannabis stocks only crash and go down when oil cycle is going down.
723 2018-11-06 22:44:46 Energy independence is a condition that has to be earned. You cannot just wave your Magic Wand & make all of those inconvenient physical laws and consequent economic costs just vanish. Invent a true competitive energy source to end use of fossil fuels, whale oil, wood for energy.
724 2018-11-06 22:44:37 Assume that's crude oil unless you say otherwise.
725 2018-11-06 22:44:23 We all eat what we raise. I just made cupcakes with canola oil, and cooked a chicken that I hatched and raised and processed. My freezers are full of my own beef and pork and orchard produce. I grind my own wheat for baking and feed it to my chickens. Why do you think otherwise?
726 2018-11-06 22:43:54 Just needs Tony Abbott to be our there throwing racks and oil on the road as the bus approaches.
727 2018-11-06 22:43:48 "Made with oil so light, it wouldn't even stop a watch". I beg to differ. Flora gummed up my watch. Lying buggers.

734 2018-11-06 22:43:14 6- stop trying to block our pipelines so you can pay more for imported oil from halfway around the world.
735 2018-11-06 22:43:13 We're sure NOT paying more 4 gas than Obama's whole 1st term! I remember ppl running on promise of lowering gas price 2 under $3 a gal.! Then a place Obama didn't control started producing oil like crazy - N.Dakota! BO GETS NO CREDIT - ZERO! Look up #Solyndra #NeverForget #KAG

737 2018-11-06 22:42:50 I know this is late but please vote YES on prop 127. Solar energy is the CHEAPEST form of energy in the US, but is being discouraged through lobbying by gas and oil companies. Prop 127 will actually LOWER your electricity bill long term. Please don’t listen to misleading ads

746 2018-11-06 22:41:39 I have record of the Aberglen collapse which preceded Balmoral reinventing itself. That was circa 1979. Michelin preceded that. Heyho, it’s irrelevant. This area has suffered with the collapse of paper mills and oil industry fluctuations. Where was government help then?
747 2018-11-06 22:41:38 Well. A white nationalist & I are like oil & water. No point in trying to mix it up here

756 2018-11-06 22:40:45 Amazing! What country is this again? US is NOT the unofficial Republican Russian United Petrostate. 

Price of oil just happens to be spiking downward on US Election Day after big recent run-up to $75.
757 2018-11-06 22:40:43 Coconut oil and ghee. Also pan fry at medium to medium high heat instead of deep frying at high heat.

764 2018-11-06 22:39:58 I'm highly interested in an electric vehicle simply because; 1) oil prices are going up 2) #savetheplanet

766 2018-11-06 22:39:54 Oooh, great list! I've always been curious about Peak Oil.
767 2018-11-06 22:39:44 Wow!  Empirical evidence that backs up what I’ve been spouting for more than a decade.  Same US self-interest under previous administrations.  Obviously they want to keep our oil cheap and at their disposal! Wake up Canada!
768 2018-11-06 22:39:42 With or without sanctions more than 80% of people already Suffering from absolute poverty because mullahs are too corrupted and they SUCK all the oil money  and the state revenues!
But sanctions can stop mullahs financing their suppression machine and help us to overthrow'em.
769 2018-11-06 22:39:36 Oh golly. Hard boiled I hope, any oil will go straight through you for awhile with no gall bladder! hope you’re ok and get a decent meal soon!!!
770 2018-11-06 22:39:34 Nationalizing the oil was what set the country on the road to disaster. From that point on, Chavez took@all the money that flowed in and spent it on “the workers’ paradise” and ran the oil revenues into the ground. Maybe you should take a history and economics class

774 2018-11-06 22:39:18 Ammunitions is better than cheaper fuel . 

Crude oil sale give rise to ECA, why can’t NNPC take from from it (about $ 3.6 billion in all) to fix the refineries?

Something must be more attractive in awarding fuel importation license?
775 2018-11-06 22:39:08 パンさんおはごですー！

777 2018-11-06 22:38:48 Ok, IV fluids to rehydrate the colon, then he needs Diovol to reduce the stomach acids, Flunixin for pain management & to relax the muscles in the GI tract so that they're not tense and manure can pass.. And lots and lots of mineral oil... It's going to be okay (fingers crossed)

You really should try not to dry out your face with a lot of drying products. It will do more harm than good.

788 2018-11-06 22:37:28 Stood in line today. Not to vote but to buy pasta. (Voted by mail.) Several shelves of olive oil fell, exploded at ‘my’ Whole Foods. People raced to see the mess; reported to others the damage; returned to stand in line & settle their debt. Seemed symbolic. #BougieButTrue

794 2018-11-06 22:36:38 My oil change was due 6,000 miles ago but since Walmart didn't change it when I brought it in a month ago and I don't like going alone (on top of being busy) I just haven't done it yet. So if I die you all know why.
795 2018-11-06 22:36:35 I just started taking black seed oil since last week. Have yet to see the changes yet tho. Ginger tea and green tea does it for me  . With a hint of lemon
796 2018-11-06 22:36:30 I need to get some more body oil and body butter, my skin is so dry

798 2018-11-06 22:35:40 I season with salt, pepper & garlic powder. I might drizzle some olive oil on first if I’m feeling fancy  I cook at 425 degrees & adjust time according to size of the fillet. Usually 25 mins. But you can lower the temp & cook longer. I’m just always in a hurry lol

805 2018-11-06 22:34:49 No, they were on-going wars for hundred of years.

The cold war got into to for profit, oil & other resources. They are still in the middle east for profit but the hate against each other in the middle east is horrible.

ISIS killed other ethnic minorities till some dropped to 1%
806 2018-11-06 22:34:47 I need some more oil for the oil burner
807 2018-11-06 22:34:30 Peak Oil may interest you. Board game that at first glance is about managing an oil company, but the end game is about transitioning into an alternative energy source. It definitely has it's dark underbelly, but it bites into it instead of shying away.
808 2018-11-06 22:34:29 Oufff I need to go wash my face, put on a mask and my oil since Imma be wearing makeup tomorrow

811 2018-11-06 22:34:03 You won’t stop! Wow, really? That is because you spent decades fighting Alberta’s AGAINST the oil and gas industries. You have only been pro oil and gas for the last 3 years. Wonder why? Oh, yeah you an 3 minions(?) we’re in 3rd party status, far from governing! Right?
812 2018-11-06 22:33:56 @CliffMass Stick to the weather and STFU about Climatology.  Let the actual Climatologists speak, not a Meteorologist with delusions of cross disciplinary skill.

Especially since you've been doing nothing but parroting the talking points paid for by big oil.
813 2018-11-06 22:33:37 warm oil soak!
814 2018-11-06 22:33:34 I guess you forgot that you throttled down oil production thru taxes and limiting oil sand development to get social licence.

817 2018-11-06 22:33:15 Hmmm we eat steamed broc all the time. I like both steamed and raw. We roastother veg but have never bothered with broccoli for some reason. Steamed means no oil. We already have a lot of oil in our salad dressing

My fave roast thing in cauliflower!!!!!!!!!!
818 2018-11-06 22:33:08 Wow.  That's cruder that oil
819 2018-11-06 22:32:36 same lol. tbh the jds naturals dark wash helped a lot, just make sure you cleanse your face for 60 seconds to unblock the pores. i usually use some sort of facial oil or spray so my skin doesn’t overproduce and get too oily. and clay masks twice a week to detox the skin.
820 2018-11-06 22:32:32 So Jonathan decreased prices of oil  now... Just shut up

859 2018-11-06 22:28:13 Now might be a good time to check on your home heating oil levels for the coming winter months

If its low, we might be able to help with a competition coming this Friday thanks to Bloomfield Fuels!

863 2018-11-06 22:27:21 The Policemen should be punished for only 8-10 slaps. Is this what they are paid for ? Only 8-10 slaps !! Where are the Lathis ? Where is the oil ?
Those irresponsible policemen should be suspended right away.
864 2018-11-06 22:27:18 - Bwahahaha. If anyone wonders where things have gone wrong, I give you Exhibit A.
865 2018-11-06 22:27:11 Initially thought you were doing an oil mask for you hair and was surprised by the dadness!
866 2018-11-06 22:27:02 Not on concrete oil will stain; just be careful when you put the Turkey in
867 2018-11-06 22:26:57 @GOP @realDonaldTrump driving through WI & SD there sure is a lot of new construction of large structures like malls, shipping depots, etc. The shale oil and coal areas are booming. Oh, and there are huge windmill farms operating. Everyone seems to be better off economically
868 2018-11-06 22:26:46 Hope APCL take CARE of oil License in senegal

873 2018-11-06 22:26:19 Pro tip: Test displacement by dipping your Turkey in your ultimate cooking pot filled with cold water before dropping the bird into that same pot full of boiling hot oil.
874 2018-11-06 22:26:10 Bernard Manning knew 
An oil sheikh asked “can you show me the way to Man City’s ground?”
Bloke says “Yes m8. Go down here and turn left. You’ll see 2 queues. Don’t go in the big queue. That’s the chippy” 
875 2018-11-06 22:26:02 ever get your oil changed to feel like you’ve got life together?

879 2018-11-06 22:25:33 Don't charge crazy rip off prices. I've been comparing US prices for cpd oil it's $67 to $126 in the US compared to €17 in the EU

882 2018-11-06 22:25:23 If your braces get caught on your lip or your mouth, put wax on the brackets! You can ask your dentist for some and it’s seriously a life saver! If your mouth is sore, either swish around melaleuca (tea tree oil) and water to help, OR take ibuprofen!

884 2018-11-06 22:25:15 The end Goal of this alliance of GULF STATES namely #Saudis and #UAE with ETHIOPIIA  is to own and conttol the huge deposits of #OIL &GAS of the SOMALI REPUBLIC .To achieve that Somalia must be subdivided in CLAN ENCLAVES sovereign States which are United under CONFEDERATE STATE

888 2018-11-06 22:24:20 Fans of Man Cheaty hate not having a single player with amount of passion @ErikLamela has in his little finger. Bunch of mercenaries that would leave the second the oil dries up. Or whenever UEFA bans their "image rights" deals. #mcfc #THFC
889 2018-11-06 22:23:59 I agree that less commenting = less personal engagement = less misguided and misinterpreted oil for the masses to throw on the fires they will attempt to burn you with down the line. Too late to stop now or my account will look like dodgy spam, but you're 100% right.
890 2018-11-06 22:23:57 In a meeting, I brought up our current IT situation as driving a car without oil.  Details at 11
891 2018-11-06 22:23:43 Somebody come take my car and get it washed and I need an oil change too

894 2018-11-06 22:23:24 Terrorist oil money. Woaw. There is no oil in Qatar to start with. Talking about terrorism when it comes to Qatar shows your level of ignorance. You should know better. Catalans are quite great experts at terrorism.
895 2018-11-06 22:23:22 No oil in Nicaragua, we can't count with that one.

903 2018-11-06 22:22:12 oil is obsolescent.  they should invest in solar and wind, maybe hydrogen, which you can generate with electric, bottle up and use any time.  Emissions, c02 and water

921 2018-11-06 22:20:30 Try to keep it in an upright position once in awhile you get a leaky one
 don't let it get too cold or you'll get an air pocket caught on the heating element
 you can just hold it in your hand to warm the oil up though 
keep the battery charged for consistent hits
922 2018-11-06 22:20:27 Steel beams don’t melt without controlled demolition! Night time is a lie! The government is just blocking out the sun! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
923 2018-11-06 22:20:12 That doesn't sound right, if they can't get it, how can they leverage the price? Supply and demand dictates pricing, the world needs our oil, plain and simple. Fire the liberal clown Tru-Duh. Get someone in there with a bid set.And get er done.
924 2018-11-06 22:20:11 FANG & PXD Both with huge quarters. Hard to step in right now with oil prices heading south, but I do like these names. Maybe tomorrow will get back in $OIL
925 2018-11-06 22:20:04 F dictators and tyrants of the ME. You mothetfucks, stop stealing oil from the common people. Trash!!!! Dictators and tyrants are Leftover byproduct of British/French colonialism
926 2018-11-06 22:20:03 Nah, it doesn't require many changes for it to start growing. You just have to scrap most of the stupid stuff (regulations etc.) that the Duma (parliament) and government been enacting daily.  
And most of the growth that Russia had was due to the high oil and gas prices.
927 2018-11-06 22:19:59 Soo.. Dropped off my @BMW for an oil change at 2:45pm...it’s 5:19pm. My car is missing.

Our government specializes in wars against nation states with modern armies and large reserves of oil

962 2018-11-06 22:15:16 The $1 billion loan agreement stipulated that Ecuador's state oil company, Petroecuador, would sell crude oil to Petrochina, the world's second-largest publicly traded oil corporation. @voxdotcom..

968 2018-11-06 22:14:55 Vote today and show the people in the government and corporations that you are watching them. Like the people who need to vote against a bill that would make it illegal for a town to sue a oil company for polluting their air and water.
969 2018-11-06 22:14:51 I'd like to try this insanely awesome giveaway and keep my seizures away like my oil does! @adamkovic
970 2018-11-06 22:14:42 You do realise that oil revenue hasn’t collapsed. It’s only the UK’s half arsed taxation system that makes it appear so. Norway kept on making many billions throughout the price slump.

972 2018-11-06 22:14:24 Your oil price predictions were horrendous. WTI under 60 shortly.
973 2018-11-06 22:14:22 Glad you asked.
On aggregate, Canada doesn't produce oil so much as it thins out bitumen, calls it "heavy oil" and exports it.
The light sweet crude we need domestically has to be imported. Making an equivalent product from the reserves we have would involve paying CDN labour.
974 2018-11-06 22:14:03 I fry dodo almost everyday, I like really brown dodo, when I get the perfect brown I like and I start to take it out of the oil,it gets burnt before I finish getting it all out.

982 2018-11-06 22:12:33 What do we need from crude oil that we can't get from greener sources?
983 2018-11-06 22:12:30 ... Yes, with Qatari money? Definition of mafia what are you on about? You are literally terrorist oil money lmfao.

985 2018-11-06 22:12:28 Em perhaps you need to think about Scotland leaving and the wee small matter of our revenue your going to be well sunk without our oil but at least you will have Brexit,  and Scotland will be the 4 th richest country in the world good luck  England

988 2018-11-06 22:12:09 that's a very interesting chart... my guess is that oil prices are "lying" 
989 2018-11-06 22:11:58 That can't make it change sound... Or there's no oil inside b4 u on it
990 2018-11-06 22:11:52 UHmmmm, Can I vote to not have E cigarettes/vaping and Offshore oil drilling on the same amendment? cuz WTH?

992 2018-11-06 22:11:35 Did y’all know Henry Ford made a car out of hemp in 1942 and it ran completely on hemp oil... we coulda been driving w out burning fuel for almost 80 years now
993 2018-11-06 22:11:31 AkerBP is down about 30% since the top. EQNR only down about 7%. I see more upside in AkerBP if the oil price turns after the midterm elections.
994 2018-11-06 22:11:27 That’s why we need the funding, though! So they actually get it done. Lol plus there was a huge smear campaign against No by oil companies and republicans because it’s a tax on gas. At least that’s how I understand it. :)
995 2018-11-06 22:11:03 Manteca for that authentic ranchero flavor, coconut oil if they're vegan tbh
996 2018-11-06 22:10:55 This would make a beautiful oil portrait.

999 2018-11-06 22:10:42 They've got company in the flimflam business- here in California, Western States Petroleum Association gave Gov Brown millions to shape his administration and buy off government. Brown replaced state oil regulator with industry hack.
1000 2018-11-06 22:10:31 You act like petrol is the only extract from crude oil. Clue, it's not.
1001 2018-11-06 22:10:17 It was in the Museum for years so I'm assuming at the least it was a semi-permanent exhibition. I think I first saw it in the 90s. It was a multi-piece painting (I think an oil triptych) that depicted a Biblical Apocalypse with some very 20th century imagery-UFOS, military, etc

1005 2018-11-06 22:09:59 You’re not the brightest are you, not when you’re so happy to name a exhibition after an oil company with something of a tainted history.
1006 2018-11-06 22:09:56 My heart stopped beating long ago. My blood is replaced with vegetable oil. I cannot get an erection,
1007 2018-11-06 22:09:50 It was a very cold winter in 2016 when they set up and did those tests. I watched those guys working in freezing conditions . Same as BB.

1009 2018-11-06 22:09:33 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.

1015 2018-11-06 22:08:42 Hi Karen. Please respond with an honest answer to this question. When you were in the private sector and decided to skip work in protest of not being treated fairly, tell me what would happen. You worked oil and gas for 20 years. I want an honest answer please.
1016 2018-11-06 22:08:33 If the Coconut Oil applicator job is available,I want it!
1017 2018-11-06 22:08:12 Unfortunately Walmart doesn't sale the pretzels but that's all good maybe I can sale them to somebody that likes them. I like them to but the oil they use to make them hurt my teeth seriously bad and I'm almost out of lidocaine.

1019 2018-11-06 22:07:52 For those concerned and asking — 
Sullivan is fine - it doesn’t seem he ingested much more than a taste of the peppermint oil - most was on his skin and he rubbed his eyes — 
So it was very uncomfortable- but he is a - ok

1030 2018-11-06 22:06:53 Next week’s wages to players are a liability. If players aren’t paid they can walk away for nothing. You need to remember you’re a mid table team used to relegation without oil money.
1031 2018-11-06 22:06:36 Brent Oil Spot been dropping back and near Support at $69. RSI 29 pretty low.

1035 2018-11-06 22:06:19 THIS BITCH SCARFS DOWN CHICKFLA BUT HAS THE NERVE TO ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE AN ISSUE WITH PEANUT OIL
1036 2018-11-06 22:06:13 I'm not for breaking unions at all and unions went to his funeral long after the hatchet was buried, a 30% demand for wage rise in a long haul airline at a time oil was in the middle of the second oil crisis price spike showed catastrophic misjudgement.
1037 2018-11-06 22:05:48 Thank God you told me you have an oil diffuser I was going to get you that as a house warming present 
1038 2018-11-06 22:05:48 Morality only stretches to Arab finance. Other dodgey finance, you know, selling your soul to the highest bidder, doesnt matter. Just god damn oil money!! Grrrrrrrrrr
1039 2018-11-06 22:05:45 A sad expression invades her gaze and she pushes her bottom lip out.

1041 2018-11-06 22:05:29  hi! recovering academic turned oil person here
1042 2018-11-06 22:05:28 1. Good with Olive oil and vinegar 
2. Smashed is best & Good on burgers
3. All of it is crap  including its brothers & sisters (fish) 
4. Take it or leave it but mustard is a definite when eating the fries 
5. Squash only, others please refer to number 3
1043 2018-11-06 22:05:21 This hot oil treatment feel so nice 
1044 2018-11-06 22:05:03 Olive oil was the only oil known and used in that part of the world for frying . It is true after a short heating period, most healthy olive oil advantages are lost but it dose not turn carcinogenic it will become like any cheep oils but food fried with olive oil tastes great
1045 2018-11-06 22:04:55 Concoction 
It weakens the pistons if it’s not a good engine oil

1051 2018-11-06 22:03:32 yeah it has been shown to have been a myth-based fad. doctors recommend algal oil grown in a clean environment. that way you avoid the mercury and other horrible toxins.
1052 2018-11-06 22:03:31 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1053 2018-11-06 22:02:54 Pity, and the debate in UK is, why does Big Oil get the tax breaks/subsidies?  Why can't the little guy with his/her own generating capacity get an even playing field?
1054 2018-11-06 22:02:42 We will only get cheep gas prices when we stop buying foreign oil, secondly when It comes to college I would never send my taxpayer money to intolerant antifa controlled campuses, they should stripped of funding until they recognize freedom of speech.
1055 2018-11-06 22:02:42 Damn bro that's gonna require a lot of coconut oil
1056 2018-11-06 22:02:31 Fix your country and stop fighting oil wars. That will wash my mouth real nice.

1058 2018-11-06 22:02:14 @LaBeautyologist Can I use an under eye moisturizing cream on my eyelids to reduce the oil that my lids produce? Or is that a big no?
1059 2018-11-06 22:02:13 I even voted for drilling oil in Gulf off Fla end to dog racing and if global warming was on ballot I'd vote for that too
1060 2018-11-06 22:02:03 UPDATE 12-Oil prices drop over 1 pct on Iran sanctions waivers
1061 2018-11-06 22:02:01 You're welcome the cream negates the burning while the oil helps get the chemical causing the burn out of your skin, while the soup is fantastic for removing the cooking/jalapeno oil mix so you can repeat with the cream again, then oil, then soap (tmk)
Lots of hard scrubbin
1062 2018-11-06 22:01:59 That’s the reason to stop oil prices from going down.

1067 2018-11-06 22:01:28 The concept of trees as carbon sinks is crucial to educating the public. We can debate the sociology or economics of coal country, so focus on the science & scientific facts.
Carbon is stored in forests. It’s also stored in coal & oil in the ground. Increase the 1st. Reduce 2nd
1068 2018-11-06 22:01:22 In Genoa, traditional Linguine al pesto do involve a few potatoes to soak the olive oil.
Pasta and patate is also a traditional combination.

To me it is not good. Carb fest.

1070 2018-11-06 22:01:12 Definitely doesn’t and I don’t mix it with anything it’s olive oil already in it so I wouldn’t mix it but if that works for you do it

1079 2018-11-06 22:00:29 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
1080 2018-11-06 22:00:19 Thanks for being civil. Rare. Oil revenue has collapsed, a separate Scotland in 2014 wouldn’t have qualified and we knew a referendum was coming, Standard life are quietly moving to London, we won’t lead the UK until the SNP are gone. And hopefully that’s coming. Enjoyed this.
1081 2018-11-06 22:00:13 As well as a finite source & polluting effects, coal/oil/gas needs to be dug or bought from somewhere. The UK is at mercy of market prices because we have to import gas/oil from countries like Russia & ME. Solar/Wind is intermittent, but with smart grid, UK can reduce dependence
1082 2018-11-06 22:00:12 November 06, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1083 2018-11-06 22:00:09 I've been getting a few but trying to be slick there ain't enough oil out there to coat them in to make them slick enough to get by me..
1084 2018-11-06 22:00:09 We had all sorts of shit...like 13 ballot initiatives, several of which were fucked up bundles that likely won't stand even if they pass....like no oil drilling in state waters bundled with indoor vaping ban....tree hugging vapor bros are jumping off buildings.
1085 2018-11-06 22:00:08 The great debate. Could pertain into energy systems and performance as well. I am seeing instant pick me up with coconut oil. Especially ingesting whole. (By tablespoon)

1124 2018-11-06 21:55:35 It has to do with the fact that more dangerous jobs tend to be dominated by men.  Military, police, fire, construction, deep sea diving, oil rigs, etc.

1147 2018-11-06 21:52:31 Stop the madness? Keep it going - Roaring economy. Full employment. Largest producer of oil. Legal immigration yes. Illegal immigration no.
1148 2018-11-06 21:52:08 So I took my car to get the oil changed and he comes back and was all “your air filter is really bad and needs to be changed” so I asked to see it and they go pull it out and I watch these 4 dudes pull out a completely white air filter and all of them look over at me
1149 2018-11-06 21:52:04 Are they oil free?
1150 2018-11-06 21:52:01 Oil prices fall as API data reportedly show a hefty weekly rise in U.S. crude supplies

1154 2018-11-06 21:51:47 I do take papaya enzymes along with a slew of other supplements, however, nothing really works consistently... am grateful for CBD oil which helps with nausea and pain... well sometimes.
1155 2018-11-06 21:51:41 How much was our foreign reserves when OBJ took over in 1999? How much was a barrel of crude oil sold when OBJ took over in 1999? Despite Abacha's loot and the golf era during IBB how come the Naira maintained stability with the dollars $? Pls enlighten me abeg?

1159 2018-11-06 21:51:10 yes, he is. who's really going to go toe-to-toe with that guy? who's going to take the hit to their oil supply or risk losing their military support in the Middle East? hell no, it's not okay, but it's going to happen
1160 2018-11-06 21:50:51 Did laundry & have to go get an oil change on my car. Blahh
1161 2018-11-06 21:50:47 Coal , furnace oil very much suitable u mean to say
1162 2018-11-06 21:50:40 The squeaking train of the LIRR car 7356 is painful to listen too. Giving me a headache. I’d love but it’s crowded. Can I order some oil? Where’s the new fleet?
1163 2018-11-06 21:50:20 Main question is. What will do the Western country’s with the facts that #Khashoggi is killed by SA. Because by the West is “journalistic freedom and human rights very important”. Not sales of weapons or buy cheap oil!!!
1164 2018-11-06 21:49:59 How are you going to deny what @billmckibben states in his tweet?  112 was written and pushed by “out of state” interests that have zero investments in Colorado.  The “out of state” oil and gas companies you speak of employ people in CO.  Don’t be an assclown.

1171 2018-11-06 21:49:07 Ironically, the military has taken steps to be more green, accepts the reality of climate change, and so on, lol. Coal is almost done, put out of business mostly by cheap natural gas. This is -immense- progress ;) But again, what is "serious" in your eyes? Banning oil? ;)
1172 2018-11-06 21:49:06 Waivers for Iran sanctions have put a lot of pressure on #Oil $USO, but that's now priced in and oil is oversold. Risky move, but I'm long $UCO

1174 2018-11-06 21:48:36 If anyone has really bad anxiety I highly recommend the MonQ personal essential oil diffusers there pretty much a essential oil Vape using diluted all natural oils and water. The Zen one is pretty calming I just got mine today to try em out and they certainly work.
1175 2018-11-06 21:48:26 But feel free to share your hemp oil results with the class, fellas.
1176 2018-11-06 21:48:24 Harwood now rationalizing Pollsters are much more accurate this time around.  CNBC, fire this clown. Enough is enough.  Nobody likes him, not the viewers, not his fellow employees, nobody.  Although the look of shock (again) on his face tomorrow will be almost as good as The View
1177 2018-11-06 21:48:22 Oil? 
1178 2018-11-06 21:48:20 Prayer going up for you Kimberlee. Get some virgin olive oil, ask the Lord to bless it, then anoint yourself with it (on your forehead) and ask God to heal you and protect you. It's ok to ask for yourself.

1180 2018-11-06 21:48:17 Not refine it in the first place and leave the oil in the ground?
1181 2018-11-06 21:48:07 Dogs are the best but if you don't have a dog or anxiety gets to bad you might want to check out CBD oil.......CBD oil.......
1182 2018-11-06 21:48:04 My machine broke, but the groovy folks @MagicalButter worked with me, & I have an upgrade on the way.
It makes kick ass butter, & it makes turning trim into medicine a breeze.
I'm gonna try it with some decent olive oil this year.
1183 2018-11-06 21:47:59 I used helicopters as an (unlikely) example to make the point: we don’t know what cool stuff could have been. A decision to build a road subsidizes cars, the oil industry, etc., at the cost of all other possibilities (including helicopters...and other crazy ideas!)
1184 2018-11-06 21:47:53 Brent Crude slumps to $72.13 in response to the effects of Iran sanction waivers on supply. At what point would a further price reduction start to damage the increasingly bullish feeling around #oil and gas based capital projects?

A bit like "countries queuing up to trade" and "we hold all the cards".

EU will not agree FTA until *after* the divorce settlement. And FTA is not in the bag by a long shot.

1197 2018-11-06 21:45:55 1) depletion of our foreign reserve 
2) the crash of crude oil price (as crude oil was only our source of income) 
3) inability to save during the oil boom.
1198 2018-11-06 21:45:51 Thank you! Unfortunately I don’t, but the technique itself is pretty similar to acrylics and oil and there’s plenty of videos on YouTube covering that.

1212 2018-11-06 21:43:34 I think high decline rates are overhyped. With relatively high oil prices, NOC's and majors will keep reinvesting. The same people spouting out about high decline rates and low investment are the same people who thought Permian production would be far less than it is today.

1218 2018-11-06 21:42:47 Oil deals have some economic similarities to venture. This one is raising $100M, 15% carry and 5% fee (managing oil wells a bit more administratively strenuous than managing paper). Targeting >20% IRR, 2.5x ROI.

3. Consider DISPLACEMENT when determining the amount of oil to place in the deep fryer. Fires result from oil overflowing the fryer.

1258 2018-11-06 21:37:51 I looked it up. It's a box. And there are essential oils. And you pay insane amounts of money per month to get a bit of oil you could grab for $1 a lot of places. 

I'll mail you a damned cardboard box if you want for free. I have plenty for heads of all sizes!

1261 2018-11-06 21:37:40 Yes, I love them. I just wonderd what mixture it was. For my two year old I use lemon oil, lavender, camomile and tried frankincense for infections and worked well. Just wondered if there us aomething already premixed there i could use.
1262 2018-11-06 21:37:32 You called it 
1263 2018-11-06 21:37:31 ...okay, the difference between doing oil cleansing in the shower and actually steaming my face with a proper steamer after applying the oil is like night and day.

1270 2018-11-06 21:36:33 There are no separate maritime waters at present (you are thinking of fishing waters, and that boundary should be even further north).  All to be negotiated (as there is no Scottish oil yet) if we were ever daft enough to vote to leave our U.K.

1279 2018-11-06 21:35:39 I can’t really give this the detail necessary in a tweet, but here’s the basic point: there are dieticians and nutritionists. A dietitian is a degree holder, medical professional, fully qualified to advise. Nutritionist is an unregulated term used by snake oil salesman
1280 2018-11-06 21:35:36 No part of me thought it was not gf as it was from a gf menu. However she only had this particular meal occasionally. Once a week after her swimming lesson. I’d put it down to the oil used to make the fries.

1300 2018-11-06 21:32:53 It wouldnt be a population share of oil. Oil and gas in English waters would belong to England and oil and gas in Scottish waters would belong to Scotland. Thats the way it works internationally. The oil off the coasts of Norway and Ireland dont belong to Westminster.

1425 2018-11-06 21:20:01 i had cbd gummies that were whatever. the straight oil is the only thing that works for me. gonna try out the creams/lotions for migraines soon
1426 2018-11-06 21:19:35 You need a deep fat fryer..(size doesn't matter too much).... enough oil (peanut?) to fill it to capacity. Take the meat off of the bones and cut it into 3/4 inch bite size pieces. Coat the pieces in breader of your choice and fry in small batches. Surface area FTW!
1427 2018-11-06 21:19:29 Gosh dang rednecks in mud trucks and cheap boats are ruining everything. If it's not the Bud lite cans it's the dirty oil , or bad gass spilled everywhere. Rain sends it into the water and were all screwed now. Cast your vote today to force all hillbillies to move to Georgia.
1428 2018-11-06 21:19:29 Yes, made from coconut oil, almond oil, Shea butter, cocoa butter, and essential oils
1429 2018-11-06 21:19:26 No, Trump repealed over $20 bil in Obama business regulations, brought business back to America, reopened coal mines, oil export
1430 2018-11-06 21:19:24 You can still dry it fully in the oven and reapply oil and build some more seasoning.
1431 2018-11-06 21:19:07 I mean, salt and olive oil on brussel sprouts ain't bad...
1432 2018-11-06 21:19:04 Woah, well the food ones seem to suck. I’m interested in the oil now tho

1436 2018-11-06 21:18:33 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
1437 2018-11-06 21:18:31 i have the normal oil to go to sleep and that works out for me
1438 2018-11-06 21:18:24 I stopped buying Kellogg's products, and I use an app to check products for palm oil. I don't think I'll be able to avoid it completely but I'll cut down on lots of products.
1439 2018-11-06 21:18:21 Shout out to my hubby Michael for all he did today..getting an oil change, tires rotated, truck cleaned and my paperwork done to work tonight! All under our very tight budget!!!
1440 2018-11-06 21:18:19 Today alone i spent 500$ on my car. For an oil change, headlight and tabs. That is a lot of ubers.
1441 2018-11-06 21:18:19 I made a tamarind lemongrass and coriander salmon ... season salmon and marinade in garlic, ginger tamarind paste chilli lemongrass in oil... cover in foil and bake #planmymeal
1442 2018-11-06 21:18:13 this is what you get when you want to be  Guardiola without arab oil money ... Only Wenger can do it..
1443 2018-11-06 21:17:55 Do you know just how much is raised from the City of London? It dwarfs oil.

Why throw away our share of that for a flag?

Fucking insanity.
1444 2018-11-06 21:17:41 Depending on your circumstances and what is keeping you from sleeping, cbd oil has helped me at times when I struggle. It sort of shuts down the over-active part of my brain where the wheels kept turning and my thoughts kept me from relaxing enough to sleep.

1447 2018-11-06 21:17:32 @FoxNews WHY would you be concerned about breakup of Big Tech (FANG)??!! History shows that breakup of big monopoly-type companies is POSITIVE for shareholders & markets!!  Ie, Standard Oil, AT&T etc.
1448 2018-11-06 21:17:22 I’ve fried with oil for years but found this life hack and haven’t gone back

1458 2018-11-06 21:16:30 This boy was sending my sister videos of him naked beating his dick and rubbing oil over his body I was in fucking tears  like why is your butt in the videos 
1459 2018-11-06 21:16:21 I've resorted to buying wright's cake mixes. All you add is water and oil mix together bake they are great and alway turn out OK. U can get chocolate, carrot, orange, maderia and toffee
1460 2018-11-06 21:16:19 Yall weren’t lying about mechanics and females  I come to get my oil changed and get hit with 3 other things I “should” get done. Lol my car brand new y’all tried it. This why I brought my momma as support

1472 2018-11-06 21:15:40 I have a Nigerian prince or a few oil riggers(single dads) or American army(single dads) that you can have but please don't take my man 
1473 2018-11-06 21:15:33 That really only applies to extra virgin but I agree its better to use something with a higher smoke point - we use rendered beef fat.  Canola oil is not a good choice because of the high omega-6 levels.
1474 2018-11-06 21:15:09 Yeah, and how much will you be spending on:
-private insurance while your neighbour dies from non universal coverage?
-lung cancer from pollution?
-house damage from environmental hazards?
-increases in oil price when you could do a better transition to renewables?
1475 2018-11-06 21:14:57 I’ve never tried the Quorn ones. My first year it did come out dry. Now I make a mixture of olive oil and soy sauce with Italian seasoning. Pour most of it over and cook wrapped in foil. Last 10 minutes, add the rest of the oil and leave foil open. I haven’t had a dry one since.
1476 2018-11-06 21:14:57 Sean Hannity for dog catcher. Sad situation for Trump to drag 2 female minions, one who advocated purchases of Trump products, the second female is a goebbels mouthpiece. Trump looking to sell his snake oil to the masses

1479 2018-11-06 21:14:25 Yea, public sector workers don't get enough already
1480 2018-11-06 21:14:24 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Mr. Cramer, You always say not to sell on panic so I am a bit confused about oil stocks. Schlumberger is near a 10 year low with a 4% dividend. Why should I sell it? I believe that 12 months from now it will be much highers due to buybacks in increase in dividends
1481 2018-11-06 21:14:24 Fair enough.
1482 2018-11-06 21:14:19 This is the carrot & stick @CIA Torturer-in-Chief Gina Haspel took to Istanbul: "Leak the Khasoggi murder tape & we'll leak what we know about your family trading with ISIS for oil. On the other hand, if you're a good boy, we'll help you out with the PKK"
1483 2018-11-06 21:14:13 Dinner idea: chicken breast seasoned w black pepper, garlic salt, & bread crumbs. Squash & broccoli, light olive oil. Bake 415 ~35min.
1484 2018-11-06 21:13:57 Extra virgin olive oil like a good Italian 
1485 2018-11-06 21:13:51 Uses less oil too! 
1486 2018-11-06 21:13:45 I hope not, a just had the car checked over, oil change and MVI are done. Very little left to do. It will be on the lot tomorrow.
1487 2018-11-06 21:13:43 Fake club based on oil
1488 2018-11-06 21:13:41  It’s not illegally obtained money. Its the owners money obtained from lawfully selling oil to you and me.
1489 2018-11-06 21:13:38 Well. Yeah. Point still rests.
1490 2018-11-06 21:13:21 Love how Oil companies get away with almost impunity with these crimes.  Talk about BS lines they feed the public!
1491 2018-11-06 21:13:18 supporting the republican agenda is u playing directly into the hands of the fossil fuel/big oil industry which lobbies and funds the campaigns of the Republicans u decide to vote for at the expense of both environmental  health and our own
1492 2018-11-06 21:13:15 You rub the oil on the beads and they absorb the oil and act like a diffuser. It has lasted all day.
1493 2018-11-06 21:13:14 There is a night time duo of oil and aha serum that is

1498 2018-11-06 21:12:31 Have you tried hemp oil? I also listen to guided sleep meditations for children! They’re really lighthearted and lowkey! I find most of the ones for adults to be too heavy and make me more anxious by telling me what not to be anxious about.
1499 2018-11-06 21:12:30 How did you get from “ win election” to sha Buy our coconut oil” 
1500 2018-11-06 21:12:28 OK, in this trial where Barnett is scrapped every penny raised via tax in Scotland should then be spent solely in Scotland. This will include all oil and other export revenues. Then we should have a vote.
1501 2018-11-06 21:12:28 i’m lazy as fuck to go get my oil change , adult responsibilities...... no!
1502 2018-11-06 21:12:21 Like you voted or you got the oil changed in your Honda
1503 2018-11-06 21:12:16 Thats a laugh coming from that snake oil salesman
1504 2018-11-06 21:12:16 Lmao. I like big guys. The husband isnt a fan of my ooogling of him.

1507 2018-11-06 21:12:02 I’m sick of having to drop six hundred into my car everytime I need just an oil change
1508 2018-11-06 21:11:45 he is anti Oil/Gas, anti 2nd amendment and pro open borders. That is more than enough to not vote for him.
1509 2018-11-06 21:11:30 I didn't love the time I spent on an oil rig but it got me my surgery, a nice whip and money to get back in school. Hella experiences and I picked up a country accent for a few days too 
1510 2018-11-06 21:11:30 That was my initial reaction after playing the demo. It's not something I really want or need but it would serve a good purpose like playing at the airport or when you get an oil change.

1520 2018-11-06 21:10:53 Why President Trump administration don't deal only with Iranian people and help them to change their regime. I don't think just sanctions won't brake regime in the future. Regime can sale country oil to 8 countries. Please listen to opposition voices. Thank you

1524 2018-11-06 21:10:23 And would increase oil from countries that are far from on our side. And everything to get oil, and etc etc. You often mention cobalt, yet you never mention the impact oil has and all the political issues. Not to mention wars it’s helped instigate.

1544 2018-11-06 21:08:12 I’m gonna try it tomorrow without layering it with oil so I can see how it stands
1545 2018-11-06 21:08:03 Shell is vertically integrated and ] Shell has operations in over 70 countries, produces around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and has 44,000 service stations worldwide
1546 2018-11-06 21:07:58 This is probably a campaign trying to save the jobs of truck drivers and train operators transporters. Pipeline will cost to build fo few years, but will cut back the labour cost once it’s done the construction. So oil companies don’t need as many workers.
1547 2018-11-06 21:07:43 1/3rd of the world's mass is now dedicated to livestock farming. This has resulted in the permanent mass destruction of forests etc. I agree with you about the CO2 from oil (hence why I bought a Tesla), however, the net CO2 output from livestock is devastating

1550 2018-11-06 21:07:36 don’t do it in your house or on your deck. make sure the turkey is thawed and dry. set your oil level by dunking your bird in the pot, fillling with water and then marking the line, that will help to protect you from overflow. Once the oil is at temp, drop your dry bird slowly

1555 2018-11-06 21:06:59 I hate going to do oil changes and Joseph always sends me like dang you go 
1556 2018-11-06 21:06:50 I'm not sure but I guess 55% of daily oil consumption is due to vehicles
1557 2018-11-06 21:06:48 @Honda getting a oil change in my Honda. The sales team tells me I should follow the computer or 7-8000 Miles. Service department tells me I’m late and it should be every 5000. Whose right?

1559 2018-11-06 21:06:36 Yes, please! Remember cats can't take most pain medications, but they can take CBD:THC oil and it works great w almost no side effects at correct dosage. All cats deserve a happy pain free life - SO VOTE, VOTE FOR LEGAL POT
1560 2018-11-06 21:06:34 tweeted about an oil change on my other account and got coupons from 2 different places. thank you
1561 2018-11-06 21:06:33 is one of the six oil and gas "supermajors" and the sixth-largest company in the world measured by 2016 revenues (and the largest based in Europe).[1] Shell was first in the 2013  3] in that year its revenues were equivalent to 84% of the Netherlands' $556 billion GDP.[4]
1562 2018-11-06 21:06:33 That depends on who believes the scientists and who likes the sound of snake oil, right? The snake oil salesman can say whatever he thinks his audience want to hear, he can make the scientists into the sinister other, create imaginary agendas for them.

1565 2018-11-06 21:06:10 Kind of like oil and water
1566 2018-11-06 21:06:09 like idk vote i guess but it's completely fair to point and go "uh actually this person is fucking terrible" like hillary and advocating wars in the middle east and embracing oil pipelines, or joe biden and his authorship of the 94 crime bill
1567 2018-11-06 21:06:09 I might actually have to work  how dare you
1568 2018-11-06 21:06:07 But maybe cook the chicken and vegetables with oil like normal people who can cook with oil and eat tasty stuff 
1569 2018-11-06 21:06:05 Cook it outside. Do not, I repeat, do not, try this inside your house. Too much oil and potential for scalding, fire, etc.

1572 2018-11-06 21:05:40 No we will not allow that, how in the fuckn heavens do we have capacity to refine foreign oil but unwilling to put in the right infrastructure to refine our own? I call big bullshit on this.

1575 2018-11-06 21:05:07 Relax! The fact that you guys dislike it doesn’t mean everyone has to, no need to belittle it. Some are happy saying my lord for whatever amount they earn. It’s their choice, just say you prefer oil and gas and move on the subtle condescendence is uncalled for.
1576 2018-11-06 21:05:04 But have u ever put a lil oil in the pan only to find out that u have no eggs
1577 2018-11-06 21:05:02 Just got an oil change all by myself

1583 2018-11-06 21:04:36 @ThomasDeLauer Hi ,in a video ur mentionning that MCT oil is usefull to break a fast to use fat as energy quickly then in another video your mentionnng that breaking it with a high glicemic carbs is good too to control insulin level. I wanted to know which one to use for fat loss
1584 2018-11-06 21:04:30 Whatever will you do tomorrow when I go back to work and can’t entertain you?

1587 2018-11-06 21:04:10 @Tracy4Congress is getting more retweets and likes on her ideas than a 22 year incumbent who is throwing the kitchen sink of failed liberal ideas at the electorate in hopes they buy some of his snake oil. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2018
1588 2018-11-06 21:04:09 Why are guys more bothered about our cars than we are?? So what if we need an oil change or whatever it’s called and that our tyres are low. My car still runs doesn’t it???
1589 2018-11-06 21:04:07 Work hard for the city, not for the oil companies that flooded you with cash. Disgusting!
1590 2018-11-06 21:04:04 sana oil HAHAHAHA
1591 2018-11-06 21:04:01 I have been making them for years, make sure the bird is defrosted and then really dry with a large towel. Then, only a dry rub for seasoning. Once at room temp slowly lowering into the fryer with peanut oil. about 3 minutes a pound.
1592 2018-11-06 21:03:51 But not to:
Spill thousands of gallons of oil in the arctic, ram pipelines through Native American grounds, or build entirely fake anti-science “climate institutes” to counteract its own inconveniently condemnatory scientific research. #ExxonKnew
1593 2018-11-06 21:03:43 @RossOCK is gonna beat the truffle oil enfused parmesan cheese out of you. Any. Minute. Now.
1594 2018-11-06 21:03:40 Olive oil makes lousy chips. Its smoke point is too low. Better (and healthier) to use Canola oil.
1595 2018-11-06 21:03:29 demand for Oil should fall facing an increase in the global (europe, america, china) eletric vehicles fleet
1596 2018-11-06 21:03:25 Wait. I feel like I may benefit from this hemp oil situation. 
1597 2018-11-06 21:03:09 Too many of us believe Canola oil is healthy!
1598 2018-11-06 21:03:03 Swear to God if you get Saudi oil money in the next few years you'll do bits
1599 2018-11-06 21:02:58 Why should they care when they're getting there crude oil.
1600 2018-11-06 21:02:41 Does GDP Offshore generated offshore get assigned to West London, as that's where most of the oil companies have their HQs? GDP or added value for each region is assigned by ONS for nationwide companies on the proportion of their employees in each region.
1601 2018-11-06 21:02:38 I only used it in my hair when i bleached it - to protect it. Worked wonders. I would def use something to protect it. I hate coconut oil in my hair too lol
1602 2018-11-06 21:02:33 Make sure you measure the oil properly. Do the dry run with water.  If you wet brine, make sure you completely dry the bird first. Keep the fryer away from the house. Have a bag of flour at the ready in case of fire. Don't panic. It's really easy.
1603 2018-11-06 21:02:32 Venezuela is an issue of corruption by the elites Money was laundered out of the cash flow an assets of the National Oil co to Russia Oligarchs for Citgo Several Public Indictments By the Dept of Justice have happened Keep saying "Venezuela" its coming back to Trump

1606 2018-11-06 21:02:27 2) Make sure your turkey is thawed out completely.  I like to use about a 12lb turkey for frying (takes approx 45 min). Preferably brine the turkey before frying.  Heat oil to 350 degrees and maintain it.
1607 2018-11-06 21:02:23 Its only 4 
1608 2018-11-06 21:02:18 I'd say it's that old Jackass skit with Wee Man and Preston, only much buffer... and more baby oil
1609 2018-11-06 21:02:18 You need an outside. Cannot be done in the house. My dad had one on the patio—cooked THE juiciest, most delicious turkey I’ve ever had—but it’s just a huge vat of oil. Like huge.
1610 2018-11-06 21:02:12 George Bush loves oil. that's probably why.
1611 2018-11-06 21:01:59 Oh my goodness.  I’m at work watching this and “there’s no crying in oil and gas!”   *grabbing tissues now*

1621 2018-11-06 21:01:17 does anybody use CBD oil for anxiety
1622 2018-11-06 21:01:01 I'm doing that thing where you put drops of olive oil in your ears every day for a week before you have them syringed. Whilst decanting some extra virgin olive oil into an eye dropper bottle, I spilled a little bit on a cashmere jumper.

1632 2018-11-06 20:59:36 Britain need oil and the impostor is helping them sign which ever document they present without review. So it's a win win situation for them, at least for now.
1633 2018-11-06 20:59:35 OIL showed up westminster for the greedy cheating bastards that they are.
1634 2018-11-06 20:59:26 Plutot la goutte de gas oil qui a fait deborder le reservoir.
1635 2018-11-06 20:59:21 1) It's perfectly safe as long as u do it right: Put your fryer on level ground, preferably a concrete surface & away from things like decks. Do NOT overfill your fryer.  Put your turkey in, fill with water until turkey is covered, and then remove turkey 2 see level of oil needed
1636 2018-11-06 20:59:20 China purchased approximately 2 million barrels of Iranian oil about 1 month ago
1637 2018-11-06 20:59:20 Goes hand in hand with the " tone vote." 
They like winning, but the tone of winning bothers them enough they will accept losing.
1638 2018-11-06 20:59:20 We need politicians who arent backed by big oil and who would be tough on these companies. The govt needs to propose a plan to retire all oil refineries and nuclear power plants and push for clean energy all over. If America takes initiative other countries will follow
1639 2018-11-06 20:59:00 Wahhh. My ‘08 JK is starting to burn oil like some of the folks I’ve been reading about. Read some horror stories about piston rings being installed upside down.
1640 2018-11-06 20:58:42 Big lie...check ur records. It was 88 - 90 naira and the naira rose to 85.3 in the year 2000. Crude oil prices averaged 18-26 $ in 1999 and rose to 34-38$ in the year 2000. Stop peddling rumours...Twitter is not a novice ground...enough of APC lies and deceit
1641 2018-11-06 20:58:40 Pero dicen el salario real crecio un 55 %...en el 2004 la nafta andaba por los 26 pesos ($55 2018) y el gas oil $15 (hoy entre $40 y $60)...la leche 2004 a 9 pesos...ahora $25..... quieren seguir?..de que sirve la suba de salarios si el costo de vida aumentó más de un 100...
1642 2018-11-06 20:58:39 Those utter BASTARDS who do they think they are wanting to run thier own country?
Are they not gratefull that westminster has near bankrupted a UK rich in scottish oil?
You KNOW there is no union so why do you still want to give away scotlands resources?
1643 2018-11-06 20:58:36 Get an oil-less fryer. It is safer, cheaper in oil, and the turkey is great. Mine was made by Butterball.

1649 2018-11-06 20:57:33 Before you vote for Robert Francis O’rourke remember he voted no to help victims of hurricane Harvey and for a $10 a barrel tax on oil.
1650 2018-11-06 20:57:30 Check your fill level with tap water and the bird before boiling up your oil and figuring it out then; also, cut holes in the bottom of the poultry so all the water/oil drains.

And yeah, do it outside =]
1651 2018-11-06 20:57:27 Yes one of the license plate LEDs lights quit working,  10,000 miles and 14 months old. Dealer said it was only warranted for 12 months.  Reading the warranty seems to indicate 36 month. 36,000 miles? Also dealer changed the oil and left filter loose! Lost three quarts of oil!
1652 2018-11-06 20:57:24 I’ve done that before... I recommend using an argan oil dye and developer from a proper beauty supply store. Not a stylist myself, just learned the hard way. 
1653 2018-11-06 20:57:16 1. Move to suburbs

6. Submerge turkey

1657 2018-11-06 20:57:04 I would have preferred more, too.
Tthese are delicate issues.
Trump needed to prevent an oil/gas pump price hike  before the midterms.

Keep in mind:
-2 parties promised to zero oil imports in weeks
-Waivers are only for 6 months
-Oil money can only be used for humanitarian goods
1658 2018-11-06 20:57:03 Trump is the King of Snake Oil Salesmen. Throngs of people during the 19th century sought out con artists who promised cures for their ailments, but instead ripped them off. These lines of people are just today’s desperate seeking false promises from the snake oil king president.
1659 2018-11-06 20:56:53 How is the #cbd oil working for you? We would love to hear your feedback on this product.

1661 2018-11-06 20:56:45 Going to store to distract myself. Gonna get more vape juice cause I'm gonna really need it tonight. Because I don't live in Florida, I didn't have to choose oil drilling in order to vape.

1664 2018-11-06 20:56:30 They make plenty of beard balms and oils and other facial hair products that didn't used to exist and are slowly growing more popular.  Maybe you could try some to help with the itch?  I got my bf some beard oil and beard conditioning stuff.

1671 2018-11-06 20:55:27 いきたい
1672 2018-11-06 20:55:23 Well first of all I have never referred to Scotland being too wee or too poor and certainly not too stupid.  It was John Swinney who brought about this term! We are not that rich really. Having oil is one thing but it has to be the "right" oil and financially viable to extract.
1673 2018-11-06 20:55:18 Exemption paves the way for global dumping of Iranian oil @ discounted prices by India & Afghanistan. It enhances Iranian cash hoarding & buying anything it wants on black market and subsell to terror networks it has been funding. Great move Donald Schmuck & Trumpery. Shame Shame
1674 2018-11-06 20:55:17 Mine have gotten better after I started wrapping them in hemp oil at night. YT tutorial soon come
1675 2018-11-06 20:55:13 As a Brit, I'm surprised Texas is an oil rich state with great wealth is the least insured. But then that figures, where there is vast wealth in a distinct minority, there is a massive amount of people who just about make ends meet to exist. #VoteBlue #VoteToday #Impeach45
1676 2018-11-06 20:55:10 I think the solution would have been to break them up and create smaller institutions thereby reducing the risk to the whole country if a few of them behaved badly. Kind of like what Roosevelt did with Standard Oil.

1679 2018-11-06 20:55:00 In case anyone is wondering the obvious...yes, I changed my oil. In fact, the dealership that's repairing my vehicle is the one that did all the oil changes; every receipt on file...and on schedule. @Hyundai just makes a garbage engine.
1680 2018-11-06 20:54:51 You spoke my mind fam . Why are groundnut oil and beans in the same sentence?
1681 2018-11-06 20:54:48 It's very illegal in my area, even tho local docs are whispering to patients where to find cbd oil, which happens to be in the square downtown with the courthouse...? I'm not a paranoid person but I was like "umm, yeah... nope" lol

So it's only legal if rolled? No pipes?
1682 2018-11-06 20:54:45 That’s what kills me. It’s “free” for me because I’m a Bayside for Life member. (I pay for the membership in my car payment) but like. It’s an oil change. It should not take 2+ hours.

Even at 30 USD/barrel, they will not be able to meet costs. This is why they are driving 4 foreign investment.

1688 2018-11-06 20:54:19 Because "oil money" differs from "Malaysian merchandise money"......... You can just say "dirty Arab money" you know, the racism is already established with "oil money".

1691 2018-11-06 20:53:50 Just looked at an Instagram story featuring oatmeal and castor oil and not much context, and I'm like "oh no"
1692 2018-11-06 20:53:46 Well, duh. Of course you wouldn’t. You’re not Steve-O. Lol
1693 2018-11-06 20:53:40 Means USA don't want stop terrorism supply line against Pakistan. free for india... india can buy oil and can use chahbahr port it's Amazing drama... dont worry Pakistan can manage easily everything. Iran Will be look own benifits not indian and American benifits in Chahbahr.
1694 2018-11-06 20:53:30 おはよー！
1695 2018-11-06 20:53:11 Another Red Oil tweet from the Red Oil Girl.  I look forward to the block.
1696 2018-11-06 20:53:09 I didn't oil it today.  Crazy goddamn day.  My school site is also a polling location.
1697 2018-11-06 20:53:08 My wife has a butterfly made of our daughters baby footprints on her shoulder. It’s beautiful. Probably going to do something similar (but more ‘masculine’) for the new guy.
1698 2018-11-06 20:53:07 (4) If so outraged by breaches of National Security why aren't you OUTRAGED that Trump allowed the sale of "Port Arthur" the largest U.S. Refinery to Saudi Arabia! Saudi's now have complete control of the Crown Jewel in Texas & can threaten U.S. Supply of crude oil at will!
1699 2018-11-06 20:53:03 Just saw someone on Facebook ask for best essential oil to cure Asthma as they do not want to medicate their child with an inhaler. PSA asthma is deadly at times when not treated properly. Please don't puff lavender into your child's lungs. Let a doctor take care of it.
1700 2018-11-06 20:53:01 Did you know that they just raised the taxes on oil and gas companies to help pay the teachers and now 5% of that is going to the trust fund and it increases every year too.

1703 2018-11-06 20:52:49 Easy. After you get the bird, put it in the pot. Fill the pot with water to cover the bird AND still leave about 6” of space. Pull out the bird. Measure the amount of water in the pot. DO NOT PUT MORE OIL IN THE POT THAN THE AMOUNT OF WATER YOU HAVE LEFT OVER.
1704 2018-11-06 20:52:47 Before you go sleep at night, rub your boobies with olive and almond oil 
1705 2018-11-06 20:52:40 Has anybody out there ever moved crude oil? Or worked around it?
1706 2018-11-06 20:52:39 Oh yes, I remember that. There was no oil left in the North Sea, we’d have to vote No to stay in the EU, business would close factories and offices, we’d lead the UK, home rule close to federalism.

How did that work out?
1707 2018-11-06 20:52:36 Great you are spreading the CBD Oil NewsBeen using it daily since January. It works great for me + my dog+catFriend-recommended @NaturesUltra CBD Oil cuz Certified-Pharmaceutical Grade, No THC. No side effects, very important for me in particular. #CBDLife #NaturalMedicine
1708 2018-11-06 20:52:25 . @LarryDiamond A vision for 2030 is needed bc the Saudi pop is 30 mil today but will be 40 mil by 2030. This is the same year that their oil revenue will begin declining because of a lack of reserves. Vision 2030 is the Saudi govt examining existential questions @StanfordCDDRL
1709 2018-11-06 20:52:24 we are getting heavy tonight  #indiehour
1710 2018-11-06 20:52:20 Ok. They all mean something and WOULDNT cover myself in bad ink. Lawd
1711 2018-11-06 20:52:19 Well said!!! P.S. It’s completely ok to hate cod liver oil.
1712 2018-11-06 20:52:07 Music is to black people what oil is to Arabs.
1713 2018-11-06 20:52:04 Chineke!!
I don't want to see oil near me anymore 
1714 2018-11-06 20:52:01 It’s the good stuff. Have to stir the oil in yourself!
1715 2018-11-06 20:51:57 Oil chafu imekua transparent
1716 2018-11-06 20:51:39 Yea, like Sean's support of Trump is a well kept secret. Hes an opinion host.
1717 2018-11-06 20:51:38 Can we talk about what oil drilling and indoor vaping have to do with one another
1718 2018-11-06 20:51:26 my sister works in the oil industry and i glared at her as i put my ballot in the box. #HappyElectionDay #YesOn112
1719 2018-11-06 20:51:25 They mean something and were thought out. I would cover myself in shit work. Thats not cute
1720 2018-11-06 20:51:08 パンツ履いてないまま寝たから起きちゃった
1721 2018-11-06 20:51:07 Oooo I can’t use coconut oil. It makes my hair sooo brittle it’s sad.
1722 2018-11-06 20:51:05 -2 the Korean Peninsula peace, strengthening NATO, open competition with Russia to supply the  EU with oil and nat gas, destroying Isis, helping the Ukraine defend themselves against Russia, stopping Syria from gassing their ppl, improving the VA and healthcare in general for
1723 2018-11-06 20:50:58 I had a dream that I had my own garage and I was changing the oil in my car instead of paying $80 fucking dollars. You don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone. I miss being able to work on my car and save $. 
1724 2018-11-06 20:50:57 An explainer would be evergreen and very useful - this debate is so politicized and frankly, the oil distro world network is so complicated that your average bear could be easily forgiven for assuming lack of capacity = discount, when we both know there are many reasons.
1725 2018-11-06 20:50:55 Is there groundnut oil beans 
1726 2018-11-06 20:50:50 I think we had this discussion in the summer. At that time house of Fraser were mooting the idea. Collaborations really work. Multiple people pushing for success. It's a great point. #Indiehour
1727 2018-11-06 20:50:38 Can one model inflation trends with oil prices that is not a free market due to the strategic oil reserve inventory ?
1728 2018-11-06 20:50:34 Scotland could do far better out of the UK and in the EU 
Voters must think of all the Westminster misrule and the fact that Tories know NOTHING about Scotland EXCEPT that all OIL REVENUE GOES TO WESTMINSTER AND NOT THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND
1729 2018-11-06 20:50:26 The UCP is going to brutalize this province in the name of a fake "Alberta Advantage".

The UCP and it's ancestors are why our province has a $260 Bn liability in oil wells.

The UCP is not here for Alberta or Albertans, merely a few rich people who buy policies from you.
1730 2018-11-06 20:50:19 Russia has the capability to do this...as, I'm sure a few Oil Moguls do too!
1731 2018-11-06 20:50:18 A7: Get anyone and everyone who wants to "get outside" and see "less traffic" to get on the walkability advocacy bandwagon. The squeaky wheel gets the oil, and it's too often the squeaky *steering* wheel that gets it. #10MinuteWalk
1732 2018-11-06 20:50:16 That’s the “passionate about something” I was referring to.
1733 2018-11-06 20:50:13 Crude oil Jan19 50 Puts trade 200 times
1734 2018-11-06 20:50:12 It would likely be a pop share of oil. It will all be negotiated & the main valuable “asset” would (have been) be Scotland
1735 2018-11-06 20:50:11 Waivers received
1. S-400 Missile Shield
2. Oil from Iran
3. Chabbar port development in Iran

Just the way India wanted
1736 2018-11-06 20:49:58 My reason is clear. My pockets and my employees pockets are fuller, and  that matters to everyday people. Not  stupid race tactics that the left spews daily. Liberalism and logic are like oil & vinegar. They don’t mix.
1737 2018-11-06 20:49:51 Very cool
1738 2018-11-06 20:49:51 Bruh. I’ve been twisting my hair w coconut oil and my hair’s been loving it. But I’ve been leaving traces of it everywhereeee (my chair, phone, etc.) any other suggestions?
1739 2018-11-06 20:49:50 Can you tell us what you are doing? How did you meet? #Indiehour
1740 2018-11-06 20:49:46 My hands and phone are drenched in microscope immersion oil
1741 2018-11-06 20:49:44 One of mine was the oil burner type things where you have a tealight in the bottom. They get super hot and stuff and when the water goes they go nasty in the top. I was in trouble 
1742 2018-11-06 20:49:40 The picture reminds me of the oil used when I was growing up. No wonder chronic disease is on the rise. Great positive tweets.
1743 2018-11-06 20:49:37 Stupid ass ex hid "69" in the grey wash
1744 2018-11-06 20:49:33 Where da oil at ?
1745 2018-11-06 20:49:22 i just don’t get it, boys, as a child did your grandma or whoever lather you in lotion and baby oil after a shower or were they just like fuck the boys only girls need lotion
1746 2018-11-06 20:49:19 You pick a specific part of the health care system and say we do better?
12.2% of U.S. adults lack health insurance approx 40m.
If 40m people can't get an oil change. How many more people do you think will need to replace their engines than if everyone can have preventive care?

1753 2018-11-06 20:48:36 He’s a racist, misogynist POS & I hate him for it but I also grew up watching him get away with shit anyone without his “money” never, EVER could. I actually believed the rest of America could see the snake oil salesman playing dress up in his (poorly) tailored suits. I was wrong
1754 2018-11-06 20:48:36 We don’t put kids in cages, bub.Those photos were from 2014 under O. I’m sorry, but ‘daily basis’ is s gross exaggeration. You are also overlooking our GDP, lower taxes, increased exports, increased oil and nat gas production, record lows in unemployment, businesses coming back,
1755 2018-11-06 20:48:28 He should go and drink their oil
1756 2018-11-06 20:48:25 #power #oil *where There is  There are other minerals like #gold . This al equals  #control #greed
1757 2018-11-06 20:48:23 Answer me this. Is Bernier for the oil sands and pipeline yes or no? Carbon tax yes or no? Thank you. Simple questions I don't need the spin!
1758 2018-11-06 20:48:04 Said before and ill say again people who care about "og" have big gay and are extra virgin olive oil
1759 2018-11-06 20:48:00 Proudly!
1760 2018-11-06 20:47:47 Ohh okay that’s a good idea before a trip like that, I usually do the same too get a lil tune up and maybe an oil change bro 
1761 2018-11-06 20:47:34 Olive oil or butter
1762 2018-11-06 20:47:32 @elonmusk hey Elon. #enbridge is boating a tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac for a new oil pipeline.  Can we borrow #theboaringco for a few years so they do it right and not completely destroy our #greatlakes !? #saveourstraits.
1763 2018-11-06 20:47:26 they're key!! masks are pretty easy, i recommend buying a variety 30-pack from amazon and just playing around until you find ones that feel good. oil treatments require a little research based on your skin type, don't wanna go too heavy, but squalane and rose hip oil are a start
1764 2018-11-06 20:47:25 Freaky..that first photo you posted could be the reference photo for an oil painting I did years ago! I can't stop staring at it!
1765 2018-11-06 20:47:23 I’ve been at this dealership for two hours for an oil change. @Valvoline wouldn’t do this to me. 
1766 2018-11-06 20:47:19 Was on the phone with my uncle and yanno, I don’t know shit about cars and I’m asking him about oil and stuff and I’ve never been so confused in my life.
1767 2018-11-06 20:47:14 Sitting here getting my oil changed alone is life changing I’m so independent 
1768 2018-11-06 20:47:14 So I really need a translucent powder to help with oil control. I'm thinking of the Too Faced peach perfect, Coty Airspun or Laura Mercier. I can't decide!
1769 2018-11-06 20:47:11 Took a lot of courage to leave the house. 
1770 2018-11-06 20:47:06 I did one a couple years ago. Once the oil is up to temp and you're ready to lower the bird in turn the burner off temporarily, no accidents if burner is off.
1771 2018-11-06 20:47:02 That was mine and my grandma's favorite. So i got my whole rib done with hidden grandma stuff added in
1772 2018-11-06 20:47:01 So there is groundnut oil beans?
1773 2018-11-06 20:46:56 Also use a heat protectant or coconut oil before blow drying
1774 2018-11-06 20:46:54 Happy Tuesday y’all! I am currently standing in a long line to vote. Tonight I’ll be back on cam to do an oil showwww! 

Anyhow, go Vote if you can 
1775 2018-11-06 20:46:53 Definitely premeasure the oil with water first to make sure you don’t overfill the pot. Make sure the turkey is defrosted completely and  totally dry. Make sure oil comes to temp first. Put the turkey in slowly. Have a fire extinguisher On hand in case. Roast parts for gravy.
1776 2018-11-06 20:46:47 And wear an oil field worker’s fire suit. You’re welcome.
1777 2018-11-06 20:46:41 In need of a mf oil change ASAP 
1778 2018-11-06 20:46:39 We have had 3 reports of oil thefts in the Abergwili area over the weekend. Remember to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity via 101  Contact our rural crime team-  @DPruralpolicing for safety advice on how to prevent oil thefts this winter! #staysafe #RuralCrime

1786 2018-11-06 20:46:07 @CrimeFamCanna hello I live in Indiana and I smoke cbd oil. I was wanting to buy a pen from you guys but it's not available. Is there any way that I can possibly get one?
1787 2018-11-06 20:46:06 Yep we sold that but some bikes didn’t have a separate oil tank. You had to calculate how many shots per gallon to get the correct mix with the fuel
1788 2018-11-06 20:46:03 The oil drains away and refills in inverse proportion to the success of the independence movement.
1789 2018-11-06 20:46:02 .which is exactly the reason I like him. He is spontaneous and funny.  If I am interested in hardcore business news (which I am not as have been around it for 35 years) then I go to bloomberg. Joe is perfect for the morning. Sullivan would make the perfect late night network host
1790 2018-11-06 20:45:52 Got to remember to check the oil and water in my old #car today.
1791 2018-11-06 20:45:50 I would, but I believe Al Gore got some primo spots already. Does that make him a #Hypocrite or just a smart snake oil salesman?
1792 2018-11-06 20:45:48 And honestly..you group of guys have been my favorite people on here so far..everyone else has been heh. So tbat means you're weird. Own it.
1793 2018-11-06 20:45:28 It’s faded today but he got upset in the bath so I decided to leave it.
Will get the baby oil out tomorrow x
1794 2018-11-06 20:45:25 You all should remember he worked under dat ministry before,under PTF he taste the supplus dat come from within, him and Abacha stole the money from this oil. Ministry
1795 2018-11-06 20:45:14 “i like to put vegetable oil on my hair”
1796 2018-11-06 20:45:13 What good has having oil interests or, like Afghanistan, poppy/pharmaceutical interests being looked at.. If this stupid population is America keeps thinking entitlements is sharing.  It's yours, its why you're entitled to it.
1797 2018-11-06 20:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1803 2018-11-06 20:44:31 Baby oil is literally made out of babies
1804 2018-11-06 20:44:30 Is hemp seed oil to be avoided as well? I avoid all seed oils, but have heard it has a healthy balance of the various omega acids...?
1805 2018-11-06 20:44:30 Butterflied shrimp, stir fried w/garlic, butter & oil mixture, Sriracha, seasoned salt, pepper, fresh cilantro, basil & parsley served w/Tostito Scoops! Plus crisp chilled Sauv. Blanc!!! Yum!

1807 2018-11-06 20:44:19 So - you are going to stop using any petroleum products or you are willing to pay a huge part of your paycheck for the petroleum (oil) you use. Better check and see how much 'oil' doesn't actually go in the fuel tanks.
1808 2018-11-06 20:44:12 RT LoriShemek: Improve health by eliminating foods that promote #obesity & #inflammation, such as unhealthy fats that include: common sources of harmful omega-6 fats such as corn oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, soy oil, hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats, margarine …
1809 2018-11-06 20:44:03 Honestly my favorite thing to slather all over my face, and I left it off of my response, is coconut oil.  Super cheap!  Put it on your whole body for that matter.  And you'll smell like cookies!

1812 2018-11-06 20:43:52 Intriguing - but I'm not much of a cleaner... Thought about offering to be a "Naked Chef" () but one splash of hot oil from a pan could cause all sorts of problems...!!! 
1813 2018-11-06 20:43:52 Don’t do it.
It’s too hard to dispose of the oil.
It’s dangerous.
Oven roasted turkey tastes better.
1814 2018-11-06 20:43:52 i voted, got an oil change and a car wash and i just think i’m just really nailing this adult thing today
1815 2018-11-06 20:43:48 use baby oil or olive oil to remove them, don’t pull them off because it’ll make your real ones come off too, gently brush your eyelashes with a spooly

1819 2018-11-06 20:43:29 Nother wacky half ass Religious Fake selling snake oil to the ignorant
1820 2018-11-06 20:43:27 Very likely. Craigleith was lube and lamp oil. It kept blowing up because they didn't understand how volatile other distillates were.
1821 2018-11-06 20:43:26 What he said
1822 2018-11-06 20:43:22 I wish I was rubbing baby oil on you!
1823 2018-11-06 20:43:11 Poreč is one of my favourite cities here! I hope you liked it there! If you ever go to Brač or Korčula, I suggest trying the olive oil there, it's one of the best in my opinion!

1824 2018-11-06 20:43:05 ~it, and they'd become part of the darkness in that world. They let it consume them.

I read that story and I always thought that darkness would taste the way that oil smells.

But...it's more like metal. And ice. It's just cold. 

Sometimes I~
1825 2018-11-06 20:43:04 What guy?..............................
1826 2018-11-06 20:42:54 They’re not as bad as @FiveGuysUK fries that are fried in peanut oil. Disgusting. Which is a shame because their burgers were great.

1828 2018-11-06 20:42:51 That’s probably 75% at least of their exported oil.

1835 2018-11-06 20:42:23 this wild orange & clove oil blend is singlehandedly responsible for my happiness.
1836 2018-11-06 20:42:22 lol. You remind me of red oil with most of your tweets.  I know you can’t handle the truth.  I look forward to the block.  
1837 2018-11-06 20:42:16 Sitting at the car dealership waiting for my oil change. Two older ladies who just met in the waiting room won’t stop talking to each other.
1838 2018-11-06 20:42:11 Try hard Aussie 'bloke' - really an evangelist snake oil salesman!

1840 2018-11-06 20:41:58 Use natural face washes, moisturize with hemp seed oil or jojoba oil, and exfoliate your skin once a week with baking soda.
1841 2018-11-06 20:41:55 B4 2009 no one knew who Man Shitty was... but then the oil money take over n they begun to buy everyone and their grandma.... teams like tottenham had to fight hard to get where they are so yea if they cheated they need to be punished! Why should others play fair n they don’t?
1842 2018-11-06 20:41:53 The last person I know who tried this had the entire turkey-in-the-oil apparatus explode. Lotsa luck!
1843 2018-11-06 20:41:43 Waiting inside while my oil is getting changed and this conservative ass channel is on the TV in here and it was annoying me so I decided to change it to Bride of Chucky  lmfao
1844 2018-11-06 20:41:40 Be nice if the @NDP would share that idea and get on board to support building a pipeline to carry Canadian oil to Canadian customers, rather than supporting the Saudis.
1845 2018-11-06 20:41:30 Do it outside, far away from the house.  And never, ever drop a frozen turkey into hot oil!
1846 2018-11-06 20:41:16 If they could actually go out and find a No. 2, there top four could be good enough with Klefbom, Larsson, Nurse and Bouchard coming. That said, he would have to be a legit No. 2
1847 2018-11-06 20:41:13 That sounds pretty rough. We're happy you are finding a little bit of help through CBD oil. Hope you get relief soon!
1848 2018-11-06 20:41:10 As my lovely wife always says... focus on having ONE great shop and you can channel all your efforts into doing things really, really well.  It's harder to maintain the same levels of quality and service when you grow and dilute your offering across multiple locations #Indiehour
1849 2018-11-06 20:41:09 Rachael is SPRAYING olive oil, is there anything this woman can't do

1852 2018-11-06 20:40:53 I got a bad feeling Trump will get more support. Anyone with a new job in industries that struggled under Obama would vote Republican. Mining, oil, metals, machinery and some manufacturing, throw in Wall Street and all Corporates with tax cuts. Plus another tax cut on the way.
1853 2018-11-06 20:40:51 just me erin & a bottle of baby oil for the night

1858 2018-11-06 20:40:29 Last night I dreamt I was a 208 litre drum of Texaco oil and I was on my side rolling about.

Just had to get that off my chest. #Texaco

1862 2018-11-06 20:40:18 I wouldn't want to fall into the "water" then...

...mineral oil is a pain to clean up.

1864 2018-11-06 20:40:05 No you’re not, goofball. If you were “normal” we wouldn’t like you as much. Lol
1865 2018-11-06 20:40:04 there are so many different kinds of oils in the world. vegetable oil. peanut oil. olive oil. baby oil. why do we need so much oil.

1871 2018-11-06 20:39:36 Dude, I listened to your vid to the end, it lacks documented facts backing up your opinions. PC culture is not resp. for Iraq wars, oil was (as controlled w/ Repub support). The anger comes from prez and right and they hold  all the power. What is up w/ that? Get data & try again
1872 2018-11-06 20:39:31 @greyrockenergy We are evaluating possible compact technologies for flare gas monetisation for an oil field producing 2-5 MMSCFD of natural gas. We are looking at gas-to-diesel as an option given the high demand for diesel in the local market.
1873 2018-11-06 20:39:27 Most days im saying its 8:30 fuuuuuuuuck....11:35 fuuuuuuuuck its only fucking 3!
1874 2018-11-06 20:39:27 My current (and only despite the fact we’re currently separated) wife has 12 tats and double that in piercings. Most are pretty cool. A couple have “run” a little. Now I just feel too old to get one. 
1875 2018-11-06 20:39:19 Is it not the funds from oil that has developed the immense human capital in the state ? 
Same oil built Universities n a state capital 
Surly with strategic development Ekiti could develop it's hospitality n tourism potential
1876 2018-11-06 20:39:15 BS you oppress #Venezuela and they have voting rights. You just don't like who they #VOTED for. Because ofthe #oil
1877 2018-11-06 20:39:13 Indies have a lot of apathy when it comes to collaborating with each other and rather take the lead from chains & therefore we have the situation with BIDs
1878 2018-11-06 20:39:11 I was just making a joke about oil spills. In actuality, that's a super cool sticker and I wish that the one I got was more than just the super boring type.
1879 2018-11-06 20:39:07 Yes. It will also have illusory depth, like an oil slick on a mud puddle.
1880 2018-11-06 20:39:02 With all the Murders on London, you would have thought plod would have more than enough of their plate. But then again it's a certain part of society and they always need looking after after all the squeeky wheel always gets the oil.
1881 2018-11-06 20:39:00 It's insane to me that a $40 Million operation to preserve oil drilling is allowed to call itself the "Protecting Colorado's Environment..." organization.

Like a bunch of Vampires calling themselves the "Protecting Human's Necks" PAC
1882 2018-11-06 20:38:47 You put oil into a frying pan on a gas hob and then cook a piece of cauliflower till it’s done, @MasterChefUK. Why is that called “roasting”? What is “frying” then? What do you call it when you make a Sunday joint in the oven? When did this change happen?
1883 2018-11-06 20:38:44 It's hard as we constantly have to deal with people wanting to reduce the price. We have some fantastic #Fairtrade and #organic drinks. Constantly asked to drop the price. It's #fairtrade the aim is to pay people a decent return. Price and quality go hand in hand. #Indiehour
1884 2018-11-06 20:38:41 Yep we had the two stroke oil hand pump as well #premix
1885 2018-11-06 20:38:38 Yeah, well it's not even management that is the issue though, its assholes who decide that a lock on my tool box would work SO much better with super glue in it and decide that my toolbox also need HELLA oil on it, for when I came back to work from a 2 week vacation
1886 2018-11-06 20:38:37 If you are in any US embassy today for visa (Lagos or Abuja)is like they poured hot oil for all the interviewers brains. Even if you are @realDonaldTrump they will deny you

1888 2018-11-06 20:38:28 It's a few years ago now, he has retired. I've never had a diabetic reading since. Sugar is the killer along with starch. Fat won't do you any harm. Gaunty recommends extra virgin olive oil and I do use that but lard and butter are better imho. Also coconut oil is wonderful.
1889 2018-11-06 20:38:22 Dudes in front of me at the pharmacy are doing some complicated algebra to buy several bottles of fish oil capsules. I'm like, "Y'all making Inhumans?"
1890 2018-11-06 20:38:12 Suggest independent boutiques, gift shop owners could rent shelf space to small businesses; would bring in much-needed revenue and also attract new footfall through their doors, a win-win for everyone #IndieHour
1891 2018-11-06 20:38:11 how do you ask about indoor vaping and offshore oil drilling in the same question lmao
1892 2018-11-06 20:38:05 Personal I think there’s no foundation or primer that can hold or block oil build up all day long, however there are great brands of primer, finishing spray and foundation to CONTROL oil build up
1893 2018-11-06 20:38:00 I mean surely, it would make more sense for companies to consult with someone that has the qualifications for the job. So tell us, are they really paying you for your gas and oil expertise, or are they paying for your votes?
1894 2018-11-06 20:38:00 The oil change guy called me baby. Excuse me whilst I vomit profusely.
1895 2018-11-06 20:37:58 I miss working @ Honda for the free oil changes 
1896 2018-11-06 20:37:54 My opinion is for a mother of all demos by all citizens blocking all roads and if possible air space that the crude oil never make it outside the country.......... the Middle East small countries are industrializing so fast because they retained their jobs by refining oil locally
1897 2018-11-06 20:37:51 Hahaha. Touch him..i dare you!

1900 2018-11-06 20:37:41 I’m SOOO glad to not work in an office. My office is a big brown box on wheels. I’d lose my mind cooped up in one building all day long. No thanks!

1902 2018-11-06 20:36:59 @fkeyamo you said oil marketer will be laughing at PDP for saying they will reduce pump price to #90. Did you just 4get your own party promised #40? Pls stop talking on impulse. @OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg @GarShehu
1903 2018-11-06 20:36:37 They fart oil and have Abu Ivanka now, they think they don't need Islam 
1904 2018-11-06 20:36:30 EVOO has a low smoke point, so I'd use either ghee or lard or coconut oil for making fries.
1905 2018-11-06 20:36:22 I hope I get off before Jiffy Lube close.. I need to get my oil changed today
1906 2018-11-06 20:36:20 is there a direct correlation between the amount of oil in the north sea and how well the independence movement is doing?
1907 2018-11-06 20:36:18 Well not in Mexico no matter what is the price gas keeps going up.
It's like we are forgetting we have oil too somewhere.
1908 2018-11-06 20:36:00 They same for pesto. Vegetable oil not olive oil.....
1909 2018-11-06 20:35:56 They look like a oil painting 
1910 2018-11-06 20:35:54 Anndddd not rationing or being freezing cus you have no money for oil.
1911 2018-11-06 20:35:52 Wow. A revival. How appropriate for a greasy snake oil salesman who peddles hate.
1912 2018-11-06 20:35:48 Yes you can't beat a small producer for quality. I've seen a lot of small producers grow and it's really hard to keep the same quality. #Indiehour
1913 2018-11-06 20:35:42 Make we pour some cooking oil for top ehhh
1914 2018-11-06 20:35:39 That’s a great ethos. We love working with small producers who are passionate about their product & know the value of great customer service.
1915 2018-11-06 20:35:36 I propose a special election to decide whether or not we vote @voxdotcom off the internet.
1916 2018-11-06 20:35:27 The U.S. Energy Information Administration raised its 2018 and 2019 forecasts on U.S. crude-oil production, but lowered its price forecasts for U.S. and global benchmark crude oil, according to the agency's Short-term Energy Outlook report released Tuesday.
1917 2018-11-06 20:35:23 Nice! I shock people by having zero tattoos. Not bc I have anything against them. Just never felt passionately enough about anything to permanently engrave it on my skin and tats of boobs all over my body would just be weird.
1918 2018-11-06 20:35:13 @ronniecowan @normanlamb Why is U.S. importing Epidiolex (basically CBD dominant oil), grown in U.K, when they've been growing it for well over 15 yrs? And why are NHS likely to import Canadian medical Cannabis products, when we're worlds largest producer?

Makes no sense at all!
1919 2018-11-06 20:35:11 Edge pieces be the hardest hitting in the batch of edibles cuz all the oil collects in the edges
1920 2018-11-06 20:35:09 •Reason CBD Oil works is cuz of its anti-pain + anti-inflammation effects. It works w/body naturally w/o side effects. Be sure to get+use the correct dose. I use @NaturesUltra CBD OIL + Roll Ons which work for meThey have a Easy-To-Read Chart for correct dose.#CBDLife
1921 2018-11-06 20:35:06 The oil company delivered heating oil, without me asking, and hit me with a $300 bill. They said I have 5 days to pay. I plan my budget 2 weeks in advance. Who gives someone only 5 days to pay $300?!?!?!? #HeatingOil #Budget
1922 2018-11-06 20:35:05 I need a oil change and every shop is busy today

1925 2018-11-06 20:34:43 My dad is so effin cute. I texted him last night at 1am that my oil light came on and if he had time before work, if he can stop by... He came this morning with a new gallon of oil, a whole ass pack of gatorades, & my mom’s homecooked spaghetti 
1926 2018-11-06 20:34:41 Girl I’m so scared lol they put mineral oil to help not rip and my daughter isn’t going to be that big either. Did you get any?
1927 2018-11-06 20:34:32 You know Jonathan, I’ve been wondering. Do you get to keep your oil and gas consulting job once you lose your seat and are no longer a “useful idiot” for EmpT?
1928 2018-11-06 20:34:25 Time machine to 2012 to get them to pick Colton Parayko instead of Mitch Moroz at 32nd overall, please.

1931 2018-11-06 20:34:08 Crude oil prices briefly dipped into a bear market after President Donald Trump carved out some countries from U.S.-imposed sanctions on Iran.
1932 2018-11-06 20:33:56 WTI Crude Oil -1.5% to 62.19 bbl  $USO
Gold -0.5% to 1226.30 oz  $GLD
Copper -1.1% to $2.73 lb  $CU
1933 2018-11-06 20:33:54 The $USDCAD pair rose further during the US session amid lower crude oil prices and a modest rebound of the greenback.
1934 2018-11-06 20:33:52 You can try cracking it open into a cup, beat it, spice it, add oil or not. Comes out great
1935 2018-11-06 20:33:45 They bought it a long time ago. Added their name then removed it again. Not being honest. #Indiehour seeing this more and more. Innocent, Alpro.....
1936 2018-11-06 20:33:40 Can’t be mad at people for voting for their own job security. Personally I bet the oil companies could maybe figure out a way to keep turning a profit, but that’s just me.

1941 2018-11-06 20:33:14 But it wasn't the first oil extraction in Canada. The oil shale distillery at Craigleith, near Collingwood, predates Petrolia and Titusville.

1949 2018-11-06 20:32:18 Usually involves chains making cheaper copies of a decent indie product, packaged in nice brown paper bags or wrapping with handwritten font labels to really pass off the indie "vibe" and hoodwink customers. #Indiehour

1953 2018-11-06 20:32:01 Did you know that all those companies need oil based products?
1954 2018-11-06 20:31:59 Alhamdulillah...

1961 2018-11-06 20:31:02 The government of Niger has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Teri Hatcher in a velveteen wig.
1962 2018-11-06 20:30:59 No it's really not old news, as it did not happen anywhere near the way you have claimed in the first place of course. But please, feel free to cite reputable sources showing otherwise, I'm very curious to see what oil & gas think tank you'll be citing.

1966 2018-11-06 20:30:35 Crude oil prices briefly dipped into a bear market after President Donald Trump carved out some countries from U.S.-imposed sanctions on Iran.
1967 2018-11-06 20:30:32 Turkey is exempt from sanctions. Along with 6 other countries, Spain bailed out their banks. The EU is using them to get the oil... Or also gets them closer economically and further away from Russia.

1969 2018-11-06 20:30:22 Riggs gets that. The very said it's from scratching himself too much in that spot and a small infection. There are a couple options, either a steroid shot or I used hot compress on it to get the skin softened and applied coconut oil q few times a day for about a week
1970 2018-11-06 20:30:20 Funniest I've found is new players not knowing the value of oil (as someone who started only like two weeks ago, I ALMOST fell into this trap myself lol)
1971 2018-11-06 20:30:20 How much do you depend on your car, When was the last time you changed the oil? Oil & Filter changes from £64.95

1974 2018-11-06 20:29:57 Hemp has been the most valuable and versatile plant known to man for thousands of years, and a direct competitor of foreign oil, which is why @GOP has used pot laws to arrest poor people and #USFarmers who tried to make a living off it.

1982 2018-11-06 20:29:00 A day of tight ranges as we await the US mid-term election results. Gold has seen a decent moved down $10 on the day as well as Oil hitting a 7 month low at $61.20 before bouncing back a buck.

1989 2018-11-06 20:27:45 @aedcelectricity From the information I heard, dat d staff came to remove d fuse, so that the oil plc in the area, will have full current,

1995 2018-11-06 20:27:14 If this CBD oil could get me a little stoned that’d be great..... pero no
1996 2018-11-06 20:27:14 100% agree with that. You can't replicate knowledge and good service when you pay pennies. You need to get staff to buy into your ethos.  #Indiehour

2009 2018-11-06 20:25:59 Brendon Have you tried CBD oil for the pain on your right side. 
is medicinal CBD oil  legal in AZ. ?    I hope so
2010 2018-11-06 20:25:57 Different supply/demand equation may loosen the relationship (Treasurys will see too much supply relative to demand — ironically perhaps similar to oil but with less favorable result!)

2013 2018-11-06 20:25:39 Absolutely... but not all of them make it work. They think they can replicate the outward appearance and quirky product offering of indies, but they pay staff peanuts so customer service, product knowledge and advice is often dire. #Indiehour
2014 2018-11-06 20:25:35 Really not the toughest sanctions ever...

Look at the oil price, smell the waivers.

Trump way more concerned with midterm vote loss from high oil than anything else.
2015 2018-11-06 20:25:32 Putin effectively sold a minority stake in Trump LLC to MBS (MBZ) for $300 million wrapped as #SalvatorMundi. Note that simultaneously for the first time Russia joined OPEC in production cuts in order to stabilize & push oil prices up.

2055 2018-11-06 20:21:33 Ideally they would be parked in an area where there’s nobody around when things go wrong. I’m sure, since were able to have rigs pumping and drilling for oil, we should be able to offer the US a nice jetty in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Softly priced at £10m/Trident?
2056 2018-11-06 20:21:23 But really, Bernie listens. Kids tell him: "We're drowning in student debt," so Bernie says, "OK. Let's make college free." Kids tell him: "We're very worrired about climate change," so Bernie says, "OK. We'll ban fracking and oil pipelines." Continue on and on...

2064 2018-11-06 20:20:45 Trump doesn’t even know what he is saying. He is genuinely a snake oil salesman.

2083 2018-11-06 20:18:22 So, @midwaynissan continues to fail a service. I dread these visits.

- For the 2nd time, they charged me for oil change (I prepaid) and would have taken $$ if I was silent.
- Woman at service counter seemed to hate my existence (or my asking to forgo this pain on a 3rd visit).

2085 2018-11-06 20:18:17 You need to do it outside well away from any structure with a long stick and a hook to lower turkey into the oil from a safe distance. Otherwise good luck.
2086 2018-11-06 20:18:15 Turkey has short commings? Buying oil from isis, killing the Kurds for decades, jailing and killing jurnalists by the hundreds or even thousands ....all just short commings?  Come on man
2087 2018-11-06 20:18:12 Money tore my dads side of the family apart.. it wasn’t until they lost the money that they came together & now are happy.

2097 2018-11-06 20:17:26 The GOP has never had the lock step party discipline of the Democrats. It has always been a boiling over cauldron of conflicting ideas and dogmas. I think his expertise consists mostly in just advertising his expertise...and oh yeah he won at Jeopardy a couple of times...
2098 2018-11-06 20:17:21 But I thought all the climate change denier scientists were funded by oil companies? I guess they aren't so maybe they are telling the truth?

2101 2018-11-06 20:17:04 By now it's clear: Trump's sanctions on Iran will hurt ordinary Iranians, really harm their economy but not break Iran.

The oil waivers as well as other exceptions show Trump's failure.

Trump's foolishness is giving Iran both the moral and political upper hand.

2106 2018-11-06 20:16:41 I have that effect on people.
2107 2018-11-06 20:16:33 WW1 Tommies died for oil, power, influence and land grab, not for our  freedom as successive governments and others like to sell it. People don't like to hear that but rudimentary research confirms it as a fact.  Service personnel used and abused? You bet.
2108 2018-11-06 20:16:30 #Twisted2sday And Brougham knew it. That was the real meaning behind his bland and airy words. *Join us, betray your king, help us crush your allies and friends… or watch your country burn and by your own actions pour more oil on the fire. Your choice.*
2109 2018-11-06 20:16:15 Yes. Oil and money for the Trumps is more important.
2110 2018-11-06 20:16:15 Oh, merciful sweet tap-dancing baby Jesus, is whitening toothpaste the next direct-marketing snake oil that's going to blanket Facebook? I don't have the strength.

2115 2018-11-06 20:15:51 also if you get acne, tea tree oil is your best friend. use it moderately though and not directly. apply to a cotton bud and then your face. towels aren't too bad but they have to always be clean which can get difficult so paper towels are better.
2116 2018-11-06 20:15:51 This MCT oil I’ve been putting in my coffee has been making me feel so shaky I don’t like it but it’s burning my belly fat so I guess it’s ok...
2117 2018-11-06 20:15:47 ...and voted for lower taxes, pissed away our north sea oil monies and allowed our country to become obsessed with money and power, all held by the lucky few. Then voted for #Brexit.
2118 2018-11-06 20:15:39 Well there are solid evidence that at northern Syria co operated with ISIS and gave them weapons for oil. And guess in whose pockets the money gone!
2119 2018-11-06 20:15:19 Baby oil should get it off if not maybe surgical spirit - neither will harm him 
2120 2018-11-06 20:15:07 Does he accept the SR15 report and if so, is he prepared to stop expansion of the oil sands?

2122 2018-11-06 20:15:04 Don’t know why that Snake Oil salesman was chosen before Nicola Sturgeon or a Scottish representative who could have put a constructive view across. Farage should go back into his box.

2126 2018-11-06 20:14:54 I wonder how many gallons of vegetable oil is used at the avg state fair
2127 2018-11-06 20:14:51 We will see.  I’m actually not left or right. But I dislike trump. IMHO he’s a charleton , a snake oil salesmen. A con who’s scamming Americans as he distracts. I think when Rico charges drop many will see him for what he’s been for years and years.
2128 2018-11-06 20:14:46 The oil is too much..try to drain some off
2129 2018-11-06 20:14:43 Bread and polish with fried palm oil.
2130 2018-11-06 20:14:37 15million allowance, 13.3million cost allowance, 200millions constituency allowance + basic salary in their deperate retirement house. They r d one crying more with 35m cars. Borrowing will increase more.. oil is not like before.
2131 2018-11-06 20:14:31 Short-sighted mistake? Moving production out of an island that has decided to vandalise its trade with its nearest and biggest market? Not a mistake at all. Just a refusal to buy the Brexit snake oil.
2132 2018-11-06 20:14:27 Integrity and oil companies don’t go together lol. And you’re going to lose money by hiring a lawyer to sue them for $50. Besides they can just go speak to the person inside and get reimbursed
2133 2018-11-06 20:14:23 This covers my oil spill cleanup taxes for the next 10 years, the baby ducks thank you 
2134 2018-11-06 20:14:20 From my new book Oil and God
What triggered Syria's 3/2011 revolution?
-Minority's tyrannical rule
-$ billions wasted on a 3rd-rate army. Lost all wars except demolishing Syria
-Theft of oil income
-Failed irrigation projects that ruined water endowment and 
-Impoverished masses
2135 2018-11-06 20:14:03 Men in spandex and oil themselves. Say no more.....
2136 2018-11-06 20:13:50 I’m considering having #solarenergy #solarpanels gonna cost £5k I’m 68 & knackered is it worth it? We spend 15k KWh per year no gas or oil Can’t get my head around the calculations, please help
2137 2018-11-06 20:13:43 If you will pardon the pun A lot of window dressing with some smoke & mirrors about sums the #Budget2018 up
What was given to many amounted to very little in real terms.

2146 2018-11-06 20:12:39 That's sounds fantastic. Any pics? #Indiehour
2147 2018-11-06 20:12:38 WE NEED THIS SETUP, STAT!!!!!
2148 2018-11-06 20:12:35 Peak Oil, Oilfield, and Wildcatters have all come out in the last like two years. 

I'm just a little spent on them.

Also, if it's that abstracted and insignificant, then it literally could have been branded anything else, no?
2149 2018-11-06 20:12:33 Hate Liberal actors. Calif people funding Beto to turn Texas into high tax state. No thanks. We need low taxes, and can't go back to low growth of Democrats. Democrats bad for Texas and oil gas industry. Regulations.
2150 2018-11-06 20:12:17 To be fair #aaog has 3 possibly 4 seperate zones to find oil in, from low risk 90% cos to higher risk but massive reward if the lower zones come in. So its 3/4 seperate chances in 1 drill! If r1/r2, or mengo comes in this is enough. If djengo comes in, or the deeper target...wow!
2151 2018-11-06 20:12:15 The oil and water is too much mbok
2152 2018-11-06 20:12:15 I hope my dads prepared for the fat bill he’s gonna have tomorrow for my brakes, headlight, brake light, and oil change :)
2153 2018-11-06 20:12:06 There was also mention of the disappointing lack of an introduction of an Amazon tax or similar. #Indiehour
2154 2018-11-06 20:12:02 Vitamin E oil?
2155 2018-11-06 20:11:44 Oh yeah, I practically hyperventilated the first time I washed with oil. It's really counterintuitive.
2156 2018-11-06 20:11:38 So if we get the Charismatics to bind that little guy in Jesus name, maybe cast it out, toss some olive oil in them, and give your credit card you would in fact wear heels is what you’re saying.

The more oil on the rail = less grain being moved by rail.
2165 2018-11-06 20:10:48 Ya I totally expect bussing problems with the NDP. The Oil Sands are too big a prize to let go of for greenies and progressives.
2166 2018-11-06 20:10:46 There is a FREE CBD oil giveaway tonight! Who wants a chance to win?
2167 2018-11-06 20:10:43 Dear Church Leaders, you can't give your choir Locust beans and Palm Oil and expect them to do Fried Rice Music.
2168 2018-11-06 20:10:35 I use a cetaphil cleanser (drugstore) and I’ve found it works as well or better as some of the fancier shit. But I haven’t tried oil for the same reason as you.
2169 2018-11-06 20:10:34 I have a problem of dry scalp and the coconut oil isn't helping much with that, bought MPL oil today I hope it helps. I started the wool thing today.
2170 2018-11-06 20:10:31 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

2172 2018-11-06 20:10:18 I don't know if some crude oil has to be used but that is something to wake up to*
2173 2018-11-06 20:10:16 Climate change will be solved by voting Democrat, Corbynism and no longer using palm oil. We are saved!!
2174 2018-11-06 20:10:16 It was a vacuum leak. For 3 fucking years I have been cleaning mass airflow sensors, changing spark plugs, using seafoam & lucas oil etc, cleaning O2 sensors and changing air filters and it turns out to be a missing vacuum plug hidden under a pipe.
2175 2018-11-06 20:10:05 It was so tasty. I softened some cherry tomatoes in olive oil with lots of garlic then chucked in chopped olives... 

PHWOAR.
2176 2018-11-06 20:10:04 I moisturize my hair with leave in conditioner and oil root to tip at least 3-4 times a week. That’s the only way I keep it from drying out, combined with this water and weather
2177 2018-11-06 20:10:04 Ya'll didnt rub enough oil on yah face dats why
2178 2018-11-06 20:10:04 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

2183 2018-11-06 20:09:59 That’s why I be waiting so long to get oil changes. Them prices be hurting my feelings. Ima stop being cheap, though.
2184 2018-11-06 20:09:43 Yeah American soldiers never bomb people inside America so they are safe unless they carry oil with them because if they do its game on. Nothing in the world is more desirable to Americans than blood and oil of poor people around the world...
2185 2018-11-06 20:09:42 good to know, I've been upgrading my thugs the whole time while my gunners cry in a corner
2186 2018-11-06 20:09:41 I also use avocado oil on my face which helps a lot as well.
2187 2018-11-06 20:09:39 We're once again using artificial snow machines to create magic in York's Shambles this Xmas. We attracted thousands of visitors and huge media coverage.

2193 2018-11-06 20:09:09 Not to be mean to Missouri, but in all honesty California and New York and anywhere with shale oil is running the country.  I don’t live in one of those places, but just saying.

2201 2018-11-06 20:08:22 I think it has a lot more to do w oil than anything else. Oil, and either installing or supporting harsh local regimes.
2202 2018-11-06 20:08:22 Dudes be talking about women and oil changes like they don’t be riding around with the check engine light on
2203 2018-11-06 20:08:16 Well Vox I have to tell you I am white and I am sick and tired of you condemning white people. Ones skin color doesn't make them a racist. What one says makes them a racist. You are a racist.
2204 2018-11-06 20:08:01 For dinner I love steak marinaded with olive oil and rosemary. Cook medium rare and slice thinly. Toss warm steak through baby spinach or rocket leaves - add cherry tomatoes/avocado if you want. Dress with olive oil and balsamic vinegar while still warm. Yummy.

2208 2018-11-06 20:07:34 also, let's be fair. it's not really about oil. it's about cubes and paths.
2209 2018-11-06 20:07:31 A lot of too little too late. I think on the surface people thought it was good, once you looked at exclusions it wasn't as appealing. #Indiehour
2210 2018-11-06 20:07:25 As well as many reputable people who aren’t oil companies - but sure lead with them
2211 2018-11-06 20:07:22 Don’t you mean, good gravy IN a biscuit? 
2212 2018-11-06 20:07:13 PragerU isn't a university.
PragerU isn't a legitimate establishment of any kind.
PragerU is a propaganda channel brought to you by a conservative radio host and a couple of fracking oil barons.
PragerU also lies. Constantly. About basically everything.
2213 2018-11-06 20:07:12 Changing your own oil > Having to pay for an oil change
2214 2018-11-06 20:07:08 what other games about oil are there? I know Peak Oil, which I was meh on. What others?
2215 2018-11-06 20:07:04 Serious question @florida wtf why is amendment 9 combining banning offshore oil drilling with vaping in public places ????
2216 2018-11-06 20:07:02 Guess I’ll give my self a hot oil treatment today
2217 2018-11-06 20:06:59 Bruh I’ve been getting an oil change for damn near an hour. I need to go vote hurry up bitch
2218 2018-11-06 20:06:57 I believe in the powers of Coconut oil
2219 2018-11-06 20:06:47 Duh.
2220 2018-11-06 20:06:45 Getting an oil change?  Waiting for something, in some waiting room, beginning of day?  Don’t away waste! See the day you want to take shape.. #knowledge #philosophy #business #professormikey #health #fb
2221 2018-11-06 20:06:42 Good question #IndieHour
2222 2018-11-06 20:06:31 motor oil isnt for drinking
2223 2018-11-06 20:06:20 Its going around maybe good idea not to include flu on the list of xmas plans for #IndieHour 
2224 2018-11-06 20:06:19 i’ll have to try it! also after u blow dry it try adding Morocco oil to the ends.. it does wonders
2225 2018-11-06 20:06:17 Lol good gravy on a biscuit
2226 2018-11-06 20:06:10 May have missed it last week - but what was the #indiehour response to #budget2018?
2227 2018-11-06 20:06:06 I apparently know like 6 people backing Pipeline at this point.

Personally, I'm on the fence. Mechanically I like it, but I'm also getting a bit tired of games about oil.
2228 2018-11-06 20:06:01 You can dress up,volunteer and apprehend them alive.
2229 2018-11-06 20:05:57 3-5 minutes a lb. make sure it’s not frozen. Keep the oil temp between 300-350 degrees. Measure the amount of oil needed with water first. Do two 12-15 lbs birds not a 20 pounder. Hope you enjoy, best way to have a turkey!!!
2230 2018-11-06 20:05:42 Yes? I pay a supermarket to provide me with food and drink and a little bit for their employees, rather that than own my own farm! I pay for petrol at a petrol station rather than refine my own oil. This seems no different.
2231 2018-11-06 20:05:30 I don't remember the oil shoot
2232 2018-11-06 20:05:23 “U oil them knees man?” Im so annoyed but can’t stop laughing
2233 2018-11-06 20:05:18 Mine’s a robot pigeon. I left that part out. Powered off used peanut oil from our local Chinese take out spot
2234 2018-11-06 20:05:18 Plot the BCOM index (overall commoditis) the overlay is better..Emerging are more related to industrials commodities (with 50% of demand from china). Oil is more influnced IMO from demand worlwide and from related supply problem.
2235 2018-11-06 20:05:13 Renewing the Alert advantage is a Nostalgic fantasy, Jason Kenney knows very well he can't do, as world oil prices & lack of pipelines make it impossible.
2236 2018-11-06 20:05:12 Hair:
Mask or Oil: You can’t over do it 
Shampoo & Conditioner: Twice a week or more depending on climate or physical activity 

Lips: Exfoliate 3 times a week

Other:
Drink at least 8 glasses of water
Best hair oils: Coconut, Argan, Amla, Almond etc.
Know your Skin type
2237 2018-11-06 20:05:05 I use products from GoldenBeards of Copenhagen;  which products do YOU use?  I have Shampoo/cond. set, oil x3 (diff smells), and accompanying Balm for the 3 scents.  Also have moustache comb and wax ;)
2238 2018-11-06 20:05:01 Happy that my brother & sister were able to take my car to get an oil change. I appreciate them

2241 2018-11-06 20:04:50 Ry & Fitz are similarly worried and they’re men so I don’t blame you.
2242 2018-11-06 20:04:30 Bugga. Been to boots for oil of cloves for Lauren - she's got toothache. 
2243 2018-11-06 20:04:28 It’s oil not moisturizer
2244 2018-11-06 20:04:18 I took half an Ambien, some CBD oil and slept flat as a pancake. Gonna miss that Ambien on my next redeye, but last night seemed more inportant!
2245 2018-11-06 20:04:08 Anointing oil beans is still the best...
2246 2018-11-06 20:04:02 For lips of a strange woman drops as an honeycomb...and the mouth is smoother than oil,. but her end is bitter as wormwood,sharp as a two edged sword......#Hekima #TuesdayThoughts
2247 2018-11-06 20:03:54 If i didnt think your skin would get me pregnant id whoop that ass. Lmao
2248 2018-11-06 20:03:42 I get that, but I’m sorry one could still say his viewpoints about gas/oil/coal are fucked too. I mean the guy doesn’t even believe in climate change.  If you don’t believe in climate change, yet again my viewpoint of you is going to be altered even more.
2249 2018-11-06 20:03:38 Yes well the recipe for this thing you have to cover them with salt to get the moisture out, wait, rinse them, dry them, dip them in oil and flour then grill pan them and it is annoying and makes loads of washing up
2250 2018-11-06 20:03:37 A third of Scots live in poverty

There are foodbanks in Aberdeen, oil capitol of Europe

2258 2018-11-06 20:03:01 Yes, they keep telling us how great the economy is, but Trump knows better. Every major city is plagued by affordability crisis, (low/stagnant wages, high/increasing rents), & rustbelt/heartland a disaster, save busting oil boom.

2275 2018-11-06 20:01:12 We only hope and pray to get it right in this country someday. But it will only come when everyone of us does what's right. As citizens of an oil producing nation we ought to receive some percentage from the income.
2276 2018-11-06 20:01:09 Does anyone have a 1yr running error for STEO forecasts for global demand and global supply? 
From Nov 17 EIA STEO - "EIA forecasts Brent spot prices to ave $56/b in '18. (WTI) crude oil prices are forecast to average almost $5/b lower than Brent prices in '18." Thus WTI ~$51.

2294 2018-11-06 19:59:45 The difference is at the root. 
Birch kind of has its own flavor, similar but distinct enough from the artificial sassafras (the real oil is bad for your liver) of root beer. Root beer also tends to diversity, varying more by the brand, mixing with honey, vanilla, anise, etc.

2321 2018-11-06 19:56:43 World Oil Prices are dropping I’ve been told. Adv to check Stocks etc but that drop unlikely to find pump prices.
2322 2018-11-06 19:56:43 Shareholders have no more power over oil companies than board of directors, oil executives, their underlings, or their underlings, etc. Unless the VPs buy into reduced fossil fuel production, the CEO is powerless to reduce. The only solution is to eliminate an entire oil company.

2345 2018-11-06 19:54:21 What this tells me is that the companies who produce Palm Oil are bad. I totally agree. The reason they do this is for profit. Tackle the economic issue, you tackle the violent and growing expansion of cash crops.

2368 2018-11-06 19:52:25 Whatever you do, please use peanut oil. It is way more expensive than vegetable oil but so worth it. Also put the deep fryer outside away from the house.

2373 2018-11-06 19:51:52 Super simple: take a can of cannolini beans, cook them with some garlic, rosemary and chicken broth til the flavors meld. Add to your cooked pasta (any tubes or shells) and finish with good olive oil, fresh pepper and parm.

2389 2018-11-06 19:50:38 But do you use palm oil?
2390 2018-11-06 19:50:34 Can you believe that this is one of the few women that has run for Presidential nomination?   She owuld have come with her bag full of snake oil potions and endorsed Evangelical right wingers who would have been flattered that she supports him.
2391 2018-11-06 19:50:27 Oil buy trade SL hit 70 pips
#Trade given 30 oct 
#SL hit 30 oct ( intraday trade)
2392 2018-11-06 19:50:22 My skin is reacting badly because I haven’t had the chance to use Argan oil in a week and I take the blame
2393 2018-11-06 19:50:15 Will he work on a different template from OPEC? Oil price is an international market thing. Except he pulls us out of OPEC.
2394 2018-11-06 19:50:07 Free market health care is the only solution. Lower cost, better service. We have an oil surplus. Nothing wrong with solar.
2395 2018-11-06 19:50:05 Pep would say that. Chooses clubs with massive budgets to manage. The club wouldn’t be where they are today without oil money. Not that their fans appreciate it. Being against the UCL. A tournament that has made English clubs who they are today. Small club mentality.
2396 2018-11-06 19:49:57 Well.. You didnt carry a human in your body! 38 is old!
2397 2018-11-06 19:49:47 (Also, now that I think of it, starting to wash my face with oil was good for my pores. I've used Julep, Josie Maran, and others. The Maran smells the best to me--kind of like grapefruit--but they've all worked just fine.)
2398 2018-11-06 19:49:40 
2399 2018-11-06 19:49:16 You see nothing wrong with unlimited and unchecked investment by rich oil baron owners? United generated their wealth through the football, not because their owners wanted good PR
2400 2018-11-06 19:49:09 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
2401 2018-11-06 19:49:05 That's where the oil money comes in phe. City have a world class backup in nearly every position
2402 2018-11-06 19:49:02 Hey. At least you make pretty babies *shrugs* thats all i got, man.
2403 2018-11-06 19:49:02 Epsom salts make you feel incredible!!! Plus oil for a nice smell and silky feel 
2404 2018-11-06 19:48:59 Always been intrigued about CBD oil, a client of mine uses it regularly and swears by it
2405 2018-11-06 19:48:59 @realDonaldTrump Oil waivers for Iran, WHAT A FUCKING PUSSY!!!! @realDonaldTrump is a chicken!!!
2406 2018-11-06 19:48:52 I’m 40. Lol. I’ll have a kid in HS when I’m 58. 
2407 2018-11-06 19:48:36 Kfc chicken skin start taste like shit these days especially if you’re reheating it....it’s like your eating oil
2408 2018-11-06 19:48:25 We don't know, apparently something to do with the oil in the middle east.

2410 2018-11-06 19:48:12 i set my fryer up on the lawn, usu in a semi-bare spot. fill the fryer w/water and immerse the bird in it to gauge the amt of oil you’ll need. follow all text/video directions and maintain oil temp @ abt 375. *don’t * leave the area unattended. wear long sleeves/work gloves.
2411 2018-11-06 19:48:08 Well. Im 38 ..stop freaking me out.

2413 2018-11-06 19:48:05 I like mixing metaphors but I have never stirred a metaphorical pot of Greek history, Game of Thrones & oil company exploitation at the same time. I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO MEAN.
2414 2018-11-06 19:48:00 Palm oil beans abeg
2415 2018-11-06 19:47:52 -Avoid wearing as much make up
-Wash pillow case weekly
-Try using tea tree oil or witch hazel (my -favourite is from lush)
-Eat less junk food
2416 2018-11-06 19:47:51 Lavender tablets, and washing my pillow cases with two drops of essential oil + detergent
2417 2018-11-06 19:47:51 Have yet to see actual evidence of a mob except for the one that gathers continuously for Trump rallies and shouts lock her up a  full two years after an election and derides the free press.  Put down the snake oil.  It’s toxic.
2418 2018-11-06 19:47:49 4 weeks now taking cbd oil took me a while to find the right dosage thanks to info off @CBD_Support I think I’m there now sleeping better feel a lot more calmer and the shoulder injury I’ve had for the last 16 wks is slowly feeling a little easier to move,be punching again soon
2419 2018-11-06 19:47:33 the sick and shut-in (also known as me) has voted, got her oil changed, took her son to PetSmart, chased him around the parking lot cause he got loose, took him for a walk, and now I just wanna sleep.
2420 2018-11-06 19:47:24 "Major Oil Spill in Texas!"
2421 2018-11-06 19:47:23 I'm just going to say good luck and don't use too much oil!!
2422 2018-11-06 19:47:20 It was a cycle. Floating Forex plus global supply chains globalized the inflation of oil shocks/currency speculation, followed by moderation
2423 2018-11-06 19:47:16 You can also bloom in oil but either way you want to cook long enough that it isn’t twiggy and gross.
2424 2018-11-06 19:47:03 Thank you, I probable taste like egg
2425 2018-11-06 19:47:02 See, I figured the same thing but ~ 9 months ago I found out I was wrong. Steps have been taken.....
2426 2018-11-06 19:46:53 Whatever you do, make sure the bird is frozen when you put it in the fry oil. It'll overcook if you thaw it out first.
2427 2018-11-06 19:46:49 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.
2428 2018-11-06 19:46:46 Time to put the anointing oil to test 
2429 2018-11-06 19:46:46 I swear it’s the best possible way to wait for an oil change.. I drive 30 mins to my Hyundai dealer for that free oil change + amenities 
2430 2018-11-06 19:46:44 Thanks! 40 years in the oil biz--I've seen a few things.
2431 2018-11-06 19:46:42 It’s just me & this white man left in Duke of Oil  I’m trying not to make eye contact w/ him OMGGG
2432 2018-11-06 19:46:28 FYI, you can get the home boiling oil kit at Bed Bath & Beyond
2433 2018-11-06 19:46:28 Check your Engine oil this morning.
2434 2018-11-06 19:46:23 I just put coconut oil in my green tea. 

Seems I am well ready to move to LA. 


2435 2018-11-06 19:46:15 also, he lied about oil and pipelines
2436 2018-11-06 19:46:14 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2437 2018-11-06 19:46:10 Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2438 2018-11-06 19:45:41 Set up the fryer away from house. Don't drop the bird into the oil, lower gently. Don't fill the fryer all the way up (use peanut oil), or it will overflow when the bird is lowered & fire will ensue. Finally, don't use alcohol. Seriously, these are all examples of real life probs
2439 2018-11-06 19:45:39 can someone reply to this are you supposed to tip the people who change ur oil
2440 2018-11-06 19:45:37 今日は１番好きなペースで気持ちよく走れました
2441 2018-11-06 19:45:28 I was making noise at work today about how strong of a Liverpool fan I was.
Wish the strike held.
2442 2018-11-06 19:45:26 They sell Deep Fryer kits along with peanut oil. 

Just make sure turkey is completely Dry.  Very important. Dry Dry Dry.  Comes with instructions.
2443 2018-11-06 19:45:25 your right, TM is desperate to save job and wont take that risk.  too bad
but playing together on top line with Bakersfield is a good option too.
2444 2018-11-06 19:45:24 I was thinking more the boiling oil type of thing to roast unwanted visitors,
not what mlady requires?
2445 2018-11-06 19:45:23 @bbcaaron Any further info on an IndieGo airliner that lost an engine due to oil loss and made a thankfully-safe emergency landing? I'm having little luck getting info about manufacturer and engine supplier. Hope it's not Rolls-Royce again!
2446 2018-11-06 19:45:21 Lavender essential oil currently invading the air 
2447 2018-11-06 19:45:18 I voted against that Tax big oil bill here. They wanted to collect millions in tax dollars for an oversight committee that isn’t elected and doesn’t have any real power to oversee taxing Oil companies more? Nahhhh B
2448 2018-11-06 19:45:17 Coconut oil is bottom of the barrel out of the rest of oils
2449 2018-11-06 19:45:12 I don't support cannibalism, but I bet you'd be one tasty MFer
2450 2018-11-06 19:45:11 Happy Birthday ma. May you oil never run dry
2451 2018-11-06 19:45:09 If Jerry Jones doesnt fire Garrett, then a conglomerate of Texas Oil Barons needs to make a hostile takeover of the team and fire Jones. This has gone too far. What does Garrett have on you. Some sort of blackmail? Everybody knows JG is now and has been the cancer. Cut it out!
2452 2018-11-06 19:45:07 Not much writing today, but I managed to review a chapter for a fellow author (a great chapter btw), so I guess that's good. Wondering if I should burn the midnight oil tonight and power through to chase the word count?
2453 2018-11-06 19:45:03 i've been putting tiger balm on my chest (which has menthol in it so probs v similar effect to peppermint oil!) but i haven't reapplied in awhile today because i completely forgot so i'll do that again & hope it helps a bit!
2454 2018-11-06 19:44:59 Same here! It takes longer to get an oil change.
2455 2018-11-06 19:44:57 yes but I have a clue:)
2456 2018-11-06 19:44:56 Poppers are my favorite essential oil.
2457 2018-11-06 19:44:56 So you think the @GOP plan for  more abusive for-profit healthcare, more foreign oil wars, and less solar is a good direction for America to move? 

Even if you hate voting for the "lesser of two evils" you can't believe that putting children in prison is LESS evil? 

RIGHT??
2458 2018-11-06 19:44:55 I was using baby oil which was working but she was out of patience at that point.

2461 2018-11-06 19:44:35 Palm oil
2462 2018-11-06 19:44:33 Angels...I'm on a roll. Love the pallet knife and the subject. Oil on canvas.  Let me know if you'd like one! Size and colors. These are 8 x 10 (dark frame) and 14 x 18 (Silver Frame).
2463 2018-11-06 19:44:20 This overnight oil smells like lemon creams (biscuits)
2464 2018-11-06 19:44:18 I can see that you are getting a lot of grief over your palm oil usage, and this is a legitimate concern, however I am just thankful that you have taken a giant step forwards by eradicating anything that is not cruelty free. For that I thank you sincerely.
2465 2018-11-06 19:44:14 Is there video footage?

It's better if you were strapped into an electric chair.

Spikes in the seat, back & arms are optional  - but desirable.

Fire brigades just stop the fun.

Go with a burning oil bath.

Agony.

Happiness is a fox called frying.
2466 2018-11-06 19:44:09 My friend recommended lavender oil for my severe insomnia. That’s like putting a bandaid on a broken femur.
2467 2018-11-06 19:44:07 If you eat a cold sub with no oil you are a spawn of Satan
2468 2018-11-06 19:44:02 I have 3 gorgeous daughters  with very curly hair and combing their hair was a naightmer. Till I found the #Argangoldhairfood products. They are the best detangling and caring products ever. Hair is so soft and easy to comb after the Argan Oil Shampoo & Conditioner.
2469 2018-11-06 19:44:00 Yes SWAATI will face his fate before CJP.Your Sindhi raaj is based on GHUNDA GARDI, VADERA SHAHI
CJP recovered liquor but NASIR SHAH G changed it into Honey & Olive oil.
Sindhi professors r harassing a girl & beaten her brother by police coz he is asking for justice.
2470 2018-11-06 19:43:54 Pretty much, though add the lemon near the end. I start with oil then top up with water to keep it from burning
2471 2018-11-06 19:43:53 Especially in Oil
2472 2018-11-06 19:43:41 It's not going to happen so you don't have to worry about it ;) With that said, I'm hoping they play together on the top line in Bakersfield.

2475 2018-11-06 19:43:09 my car already needs a oil change  can I save some fucking money for once gah damn
2476 2018-11-06 19:43:08 I think it’s time for an oil change

2480 2018-11-06 19:42:08 Has someone poured oil on mane’s shoes . Man keeps slipping
2481 2018-11-06 19:42:05 Eddie could sell oil to the Arabs mate... Amazing at what he does but some of the shit he talks is scary... Everyone in his stable are future world champions... AJ biggest star in world boxing   I know its his job to hype his fighters but ffs get a grip hearn
2482 2018-11-06 19:41:56 Or, we could continue to use palm oil , stop further habitat destruction and ensure it is grown sustainably - this cannot happen under our current economic system however. But let's say people do stop the growing palm oil, this still will not effect climate change.
2483 2018-11-06 19:41:53 Apparently Olbas oil works on coughs as well. My father in law swears by it.
2484 2018-11-06 19:41:40 Saudi Arabia: A nation with nothing to recommend itself as an ally except for oil.
2485 2018-11-06 19:41:25 Iran oilmin #Zangeneh: US sanctions waivers do not match demand for Iran’s oil; oil consumers poised to see painful months.
Despite ranting by Mr #Trump and regional allies, US government acknowledged impossibility of eliminating Iran from undersupplied Iran’s oil market.
2486 2018-11-06 19:41:09 Try some peppermint oil on your chest. I also like to heat up some water in a kettle,pour it in a bowl, with a few drops of the pep oil and stick my face over the bowl with a towel over my head
2487 2018-11-06 19:41:08 And tell me about Keystone. Do we get any of that oil? No. We take all the risk, and get nothing for it. What a deal.
2488 2018-11-06 19:41:01 Now do the effect of a $15 min wage on inflation and resulting rate hikes.
2489 2018-11-06 19:40:58 My eyes are legit like going to the mechanic for an oil change & then he tells you everything that’s wrong with the car
2490 2018-11-06 19:40:56 Hydration = drinking loads of water + oil 
2491 2018-11-06 19:40:56 funny kind of sanctions this time, big oil customers either have waivers or not to recognize the sanctios as legal !
2492 2018-11-06 19:40:43 @twix I ’d you. Now horrified to find you contain palm oil which causes awful environmental trauma. Please ditch it so I can  you again?
2493 2018-11-06 19:40:40 If only Texas had oil and could afford an efficient opting system ...

2497 2018-11-06 19:40:10 Imagine what you would do if all your bills went away - because free energy tech covers oil, gas. electric- those exploitive companies are gone. Imagine what you would do with $5,000 a month in free income
2498 2018-11-06 19:40:08 The whole beef is that Alberta can't get a fair price for its oil because the only market is the US. The previous government failed to advance a pipeline to non-US tidewater. The current government bought a pipeline project to tidewater so that non-US markets are available.
2499 2018-11-06 19:40:08 YouTube has good tutorials. Basically: heat the oil, kill the fire while lowering the bird, then worry about temp and time.
2500 2018-11-06 19:40:06 Olive oil really saved my hair 
2501 2018-11-06 19:40:02 Can it be combined?
2502 2018-11-06 19:39:56 Jesus. Must be murder on that oil rig. I'd kill everyone, like a big baldy, Irish xenomorph round it, picking you off one by one with my craic.

2504 2018-11-06 19:39:53 Lads CBD oil is actually the best, changed my life
2505 2018-11-06 19:39:45 Trump, his admin and Republicans will make sure to get right on fixing that problem by cutting more regulations,drilling for more oil off our coastlines to burn baby burn and on and on until the hole expands again. Their children and grandchildren will thank them I'm sure.
2506 2018-11-06 19:39:43 Arizona: Sinema is fine like Cinnamon Wine.

    Vote Democrat, vote SINEMA for the Senate
2507 2018-11-06 19:39:40 I wash my face three times a day. When i wake up, when i shower and before bed. I use light oils that won’t clog me up like coconut oil and drink hella water. Almost no soda or juice in my diet. Never really had much acne in my life.
2508 2018-11-06 19:39:32 Oh thanks .... I'm no oil painting but minger is just mean 
2509 2018-11-06 19:39:29 Nice try. You are intentionally misleading. 

"The GHGRP also found total emissions from the oil and gas  industry, including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, increased about  one percent during that time period."
2510 2018-11-06 19:39:24 As am I ;) Remember, the crowd who dislikes Russell are a completely different crowd from the ones who are anti-Klefbom.
2511 2018-11-06 19:39:18 Who was pimping fracking all over the world? Which party reopened the arctic for oil drilling? Which party expanded drilling in the gulf of Mexico after the BP spill?
2512 2018-11-06 19:39:14 The common sensical thing this Govt & @IbeKachikwu's ministry should have done was to repair our 445,000 BPD refineries to function @ 100% capacity & save us the national embarrassment of being Africa's major oil exporter & refined fuel importer at the same time.
2513 2018-11-06 19:39:12 average price in wokingham most garages 138-139.9 per litre diesel 

if price had dropped in line as oil now brent $72 was smidgen over $85 
should be 124-127p -- taking the piss @PhilipHammondUK should intervene impacts rpi & cpi - screws with Fiscal and Monetary policy
2514 2018-11-06 19:39:10 Oil guy: I love explaining things to people that don’t know
Me: I know I have to replace my oil filter, I know I have to fill out paperwork, just leave me alone. I JUST got this car

2516 2018-11-06 19:38:44 The difference betwen the KSA & Iraq was Iraq constantly fighting sectarianism and MBS is more radical than saddam he doesnt know who limits and can impact the oil market Saddam didnt have the cards MBS has in his deck so I disagree he is more like Ghadaffi was in Libya
2517 2018-11-06 19:38:41 Nice of Alaska to put a bird covered in oil from a spill on their sticker.

2519 2018-11-06 19:38:27 Tea tree oil and coconut oil are life savers along with a deep clean wash.... also wear make up as littles as possible or only when necessary work or going out ect :)
2520 2018-11-06 19:38:20 In September I suggested US (S&P lower).  Now I'm suggesting oil higher.  All suggestions are not investment advice.
2521 2018-11-06 19:38:19 I've talked to people who said they could heat their homes by driving a pipe into the ground. Always interesting to see them pumping oil around Leamington and up towards Sarnia/Petrolia.

2524 2018-11-06 19:38:04 Does it matter what we are doing with the oil? We could cease production of it and do away with it, but we could also cease to do away with alot of things - many that are significantly worse for the environment and what I'm not seeing people advocating for on mass.
2525 2018-11-06 19:38:01 Eez like u ate egusi soup they used groundnut oil to cook.

2666 2018-11-06 19:24:18 Ali, how about doing a report on the massive campaign donations received by climate change deniers in Congress & WH (POTUS)? 
Climate change deniers = Recipients of oil & gas company campaign donations.
2667 2018-11-06 19:24:18 At least every 5 minutes a post about the wonders of cannabis oil and it's healing properties comes up! Good Bye EVIL Big Pharma
2668 2018-11-06 19:24:17 so now, someone has to win that psg match. you guys cant afford them to draw that game o
2669 2018-11-06 19:24:09 Buhari's FG increased fuel prices when crude oil price was low, while we (all Nigerians, especially led by APC) resisted fuel price increase while crude oil prices were at their peak.

Nigerians deserve an unreserved apology from the APC Government , over this anomaly.
2670 2018-11-06 19:24:08 He reminds me of our dog. When she wanted food really bad but if she was not allowed to take it, she would pretend not to look at it.
2671 2018-11-06 19:24:08 Has anyone got any DD for dollar cost per gram of medical grade raw CBD crude oil + average quantity that can be extracted per sun grown plant?

$LG.V 30% of Global Canna will soon be a significant asset when 750 plants are being processed every 2 weeks.. all year round.
2672 2018-11-06 19:24:04 My 18 year old niece who was raised the same as me (conservative oil field yee haw town) just voted for her first time (and voted blue)  proud auntie right here.  #VotingDay #Vote2018
2673 2018-11-06 19:24:03 All over oil
2674 2018-11-06 19:23:40 voting YES means you are in favor of the restrictions, voting NO means you are ok with oil&gas drilling by homes and schools. You most definitely want to vote YES on that one.
2675 2018-11-06 19:23:30 how can you be talking when your oil funded club broke FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY REGULATIONs hahahahahaha
2676 2018-11-06 19:23:00 The privilege are one percent of the population.
The one percent breaks down like this.
75 percent are doctors and lawyers.
24 percent are actors and sports stars etc.
The one percent of the one percent have 93 percent of all the money in America. Oil men. Vote Blue
2677 2018-11-06 19:22:39 CBD oil is the new coconut oil fellas
2678 2018-11-06 19:22:30 Because I woke up at 6AM to get an oil change. fuck you hater 
2679 2018-11-06 19:22:27 so pissed . if bmw don’t hurry up with my car .. bc my mama high ass oil change ain’t gone cut it
2680 2018-11-06 19:22:26 On women, but what about the oil/gas/coal industry? The financial cuts to middle eastern country and the gun control? I might support his ideas on different topics other than the issues we see in the mass media
2681 2018-11-06 19:22:24 Lmao so I’m in homeland at the shop right, this lady come in looking for a oil pipe and I was like you mean like a rig and she goes no like a meth pipe .. lmao I was like hell nah lady this a weed shop not a trap house
2682 2018-11-06 19:22:17 @BarbraStreisand People need to get along?  BUSH?   Oh Barbra.  I just threw up a little.   How many people got along by being murdered in wars for oil?  This is why we need celebrities to just shut up.   Go make some music.
2683 2018-11-06 19:22:13 They started spinning potential losses early today. Internal polling must be bleak.
2684 2018-11-06 19:22:12 As well given habitat loss due to PO, how much is through violent expansion from companies wanting to make cash? Which ties directly into my issue being with the exploitative economic system and not palm oil itself.
2685 2018-11-06 19:22:06 Im pretty sure my innards are chemicaly ruined from my teens and early 20's. Lol
2686 2018-11-06 19:21:57 Was suppose to go to Renovo today. But my car started overheating ... After me changing my oil yesterday ... Damn I have to set up another way to get the job done. :( #workstruggles #renovotrip #strugglingsingledad
2687 2018-11-06 19:21:53 Funny how I can’t like or retweet this. 
2688 2018-11-06 19:21:40 We'd be wrecking the planet less if we cut off Saudi and Venezuelan oil and use our own. Ultimately I would love it if renewables could compete but for now they can't. It's impossible to go purely renewable in relatively cold and snowy country with 6 hr days. People are desperate

2692 2018-11-06 19:21:32 What is to read ? All you two do is precent fictional information , nothing with any substantive facts , lots of opinions . Your obviously looking for a audience of recluses and who ever else you sell your line of charmed snake oil too !
2693 2018-11-06 19:21:28 ... Did eventually increase petrol price to the current N 145 per liter, crude oil price was at $45 per barrel. So the pertinent question is, which Admin was being more sincere about an increase due to high crude oil price?

You can consult OPEC & CBN for these oil prices.
2694 2018-11-06 19:21:24 All you need is a little beard oil bro!
2695 2018-11-06 19:21:22 I'm caught between two views on this. 1. Their forecasting is shit. There's no use candy-coating that fact. 2. Everybody's oil forecasting is shit. There's no use candy-coating that. I honestly don't know why they release projections to the public.  Or, publish accuracy data, too
2696 2018-11-06 19:21:22 Shame on you! Hope more Iranians wake up and see voting to Democrats is a stupid thing. Mullahs will fall soon, find another source of income..no more oil money coming to you to

2699 2018-11-06 19:20:53 Well, here's a thing. I went to bed last night at the hotel knowing that my car oil was messed up. But @owentew checked it before I left. So that meant I had a leak.
2700 2018-11-06 19:20:50 Lol
2701 2018-11-06 19:20:49 I went and they were like tell faith to stop telling people we sell olive oil
2702 2018-11-06 19:20:49 This oil that will soon fade away?
Automobile companies are going electric, solar energy here and there the universe is fighting the effects of emission. I pray they leave room for more sensible people to bring us a change. Nigeria is a mess, I said that and won't apologize. Yes!
2703 2018-11-06 19:20:42 While #Turkey is focused on Black Sea/Mediterranean Sea #naturalgas #oil, #SaudiArabia #UAE are looking to secure oil exports via Red Sea outposts. The oil and gas exports are primarily aimed at the Europe and the US markets. This is a principal reason behind the war in #Yemen.
2704 2018-11-06 19:20:41 Thank God Thierry Henry wasn't given the Arsenal job. Oil would have been discovered at the Emirates by now. #UCL #ASMCLU
2705 2018-11-06 19:20:38 Prior to June, yes. Now? Permanently impossible. 
2706 2018-11-06 19:20:36 Nothing is silent. Look at the oil prices..
2707 2018-11-06 19:20:11 1) When Saudi Arabia runs out of oil the Royals will move to Europe with their stolen millions to live in their castles, and will abandon the poor Saudis to their fate. There is nothing in the #KSA which is not propped up by oil money. There is nothing else.
2708 2018-11-06 19:20:04 @atiku Sir, there are alleged statements making the rounds of your 'prospective' government crashing the price of PMS to N97/L should you be elected.

1. Did you make those statements?

2. If yes, how do you plan on making that a reality at current global crude oil prices?
2709 2018-11-06 19:19:51 Yep,it seems nobody cares unless oil,coal and diamonds are discovered in PR. What a lousy way to treat US citizens.!!

2718 2018-11-06 19:18:29 I want to once again voice that by purchasing products that include palm oil as an ingredient you are funding and saying the burning of rainforest in the leuser system is acceptable where animals if quick enough make it out and have no home to return to or are burnt alive if not.
2719 2018-11-06 19:18:21 It’s okay I saved the oil in a bag and I’m going to put it on blunts lmao and it was less then half full too so I wasn’t to mad

2721 2018-11-06 19:18:15 I need a little oil change on my flying car. My Twitter wit seems a little rusty to be dieting only on age-old potatoes. Might have served me better if they've been fermented for wine. ;)
2722 2018-11-06 19:18:09 I totally disagree with you on this. Jonathan caused the recession not Buhari. We are too learned to be deceived. Governors kept sharing foreign reserve, excess crude oil account etc. You shouldn't play with our feature please. Make constructive criticism.

2727 2018-11-06 19:17:26 It reminds of the time when my grandma made us queue for Castor oil.
2728 2018-11-06 19:17:23 Bros no solution oooooo, because they will still spend all the money we  have had from this increase in oil price for campaign

2733 2018-11-06 19:17:12 #5. This is the genesis of the current fuel subsidy/NNPC's under recovery scam in Nigeria.

A bit of history:
In 2012, when GEJ attempted to increase fuel price, crude oil was sold internationally at $100+ per barrel - you know the rest of the story.
However in 2016, when Buhari

2735 2018-11-06 19:17:08 It's the oil rig/vaping amendment  People have just gone nuts. Nothing like that at my old folks home polling place.
2736 2018-11-06 19:17:05 Don't be fooled by my pictures. 
Anyway I'll still tell you what I have started doing and it's helped a lot. HAIR MASKS ARE THE KEY!! Get dove quenched hair mask and shampoo. Just hair mask is enough. Along with that coconut oil your hair AT LEAST once a week. Trust. you'll see.
2737 2018-11-06 19:16:36 You cannot remove them with oil 
2738 2018-11-06 19:16:29 I f..... hope so. Because last month has been brutal on oil equity investors.
2739 2018-11-06 19:16:17 On land lines.answered a couple calls this election. Were computer calls and very in general. Don’t think the hacks actually use what people answer, they just say what who ever is buying the info wants to hear. Kinda like way back when they sold ‘snake oil’
2740 2018-11-06 19:16:16 olive oil or krystal
2741 2018-11-06 19:16:15 Nope. The fix was just adding a small bit of oil to the joint.

2758 2018-11-06 19:13:59 Last night my mom told me she got our dog CBD oil for her anxiety, which is hilarious because when I asked to take CBD oil for my migraines she acted like I was the biggest pot head on the planet.
2759 2018-11-06 19:13:38 You must have been 12 during the 2008 financial crisis so I don't expect you to know what happens to oil in such a scenario.

2773 2018-11-06 19:12:27 It takes 10 yrs to build a refinery with a Coker to handle heavy oil. If there was more profit in refineries, it would have been built decades ago. Oil ind doesn't want more refineries. They want to sell raw crude! Free market dictates, not opinions.
2774 2018-11-06 19:12:26 A complete overhaul is needed in that squad the way City did,they have the oil money,let them use it.Jardim suffered a man slaughter sort of death,all the cool kids left
2775 2018-11-06 19:12:23 The belief in this President as someone who gives two hoots about main street America or lost jobs overseas just floors me.

2779 2018-11-06 19:11:53 I'm a bit of a generalist, but my biggest field for a long time was oil/gas/power. I started working for Big Client 1 when Petrobras's US shareholders sued them for failure to properly disclose what they knew about the corruption investigations on their financial reports.
2780 2018-11-06 19:11:48 Strange you won’t go out east to protest imported oil because it’s “not your area” but some invested in the American election
2781 2018-11-06 19:11:47 Has anyone used CASTRO oil to help stimulate your contractions?
2782 2018-11-06 19:11:36 How about a price on every innocent soul being murdered. Billions die each year. If a carbon tax works how about a slaughter, testing and abuse tax. Oh wait tax on oil is easier.
2783 2018-11-06 19:11:33 There's no fun in eating a "peanut butter" that has added oil and fillers to lessen the flavor of real peanut butter. This is a serious matter LOL!

2786 2018-11-06 19:11:24 Brilliant stuff from @_ECorbin @thinkDIF_: we need to recalibrate why #biomaterials are considered niche when made from abundant resources while materials made from finite oil are considered the norm #thinkdef
2787 2018-11-06 19:11:17 Interested to hear how you get along with this brand and if it’s worth me trawling amazon for it. Mine is tinted, matt finish and oil free and I’m not allergic to it (gaaaasp). But even holy grail spf can be improved on ;)
2788 2018-11-06 19:11:14 And of course, capitalism doesn't only effect palm oil but our global production which is arguably the main cause of climate breakdown. Tackle it instead of singular issues like palm oil, which when compared to animal agriculture, transport, commodity production, is miniscle.
2789 2018-11-06 19:11:09 EVERYWHERE... IN THE CONCRETE EVERYWHERE. Being turned into fuel to be used in cars and electricity. There is no such thing as a fossil fuel. Everything that dies becomes oil.
2790 2018-11-06 19:10:58 Now to some of the points you raised, let's start with #2. 

Yes you are correct that major marketers abused the process of fuel importation & subsidy payment, but no company benefitted most from oil subsidy payment than Oando - owned by Bola Tinubu (APC's national leader)
2791 2018-11-06 19:10:43 Pals hired car in London for 8 days, surprised to find after only 2hrs it needed oil, were accused by Edinburgh airport branch of lying to get upgrade (mechanic report backed pals up) and charged extra for petrol. Holiday marred, to say the least. Poor show @SixtUK
2792 2018-11-06 19:10:20 FFP restricts the owners investment opportunity and therefore they and PSG have circumnavigated the rules. The owners are investing as part of a greater PR campaign over the next 30years when the oil runs out and paper over things like child trafficking and potential war crimes.

2797 2018-11-06 19:09:56 Holy crap, what an insane stream today! We've got so much done, including the overkill EMC farm and the creosote oil farm!

Thank you everyone for the support today, it has been absolutely amazing as usual!

Shoutout to @DeafMints for the raid!

See you all next time! 
2798 2018-11-06 19:09:55 I'm addicted to the olive oil and sea salt popcorn from @brandless
2799 2018-11-06 19:09:40 So I was thinking to myself about how Nick is going to be the housewife because he packs me lunches and cooks well, but now he’s about to change my oil too..... I’m confused on which roll he is
2800 2018-11-06 19:09:13 Drilling oil underwater sef doesn't take this long
2801 2018-11-06 19:09:06 While I was home today I got my oil changed and was told I need new brakes 
2802 2018-11-06 19:08:29 Sean since you work for Trump what about Ivanka getting today trademarks from China the day after Trump gives China waivers for Iran oil  ???? #CORRUPTION ???? #GOPCorruption #GOPVotingBlue #Shameful
2803 2018-11-06 19:08:26 Secondly, both D crude swap deal and Kachikwu's recent "Direct Sale, Direct Purchase" regime are fraught with fraudulence & SCAMs in their own rights.

Simple solution was/is to repair/fix D refineries to function @ 100% capacity utilization + improve the crude oil fed into them
2804 2018-11-06 19:08:18 HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA

All you need to know about the Cooking Manga is that no one wears proper clothes, they cook nekkid or in bikins and no one gets splattered with burning oil
2805 2018-11-06 19:08:16 Is this an oil painting by Maxime Xavier?
2806 2018-11-06 19:08:16 Really!!?? Wht kind of oil for Toyota Camry
2807 2018-11-06 19:08:15 I suspect accurately counting moose is way harder than reclaiming an oil sands mining operation. Waaaaay harder.
2808 2018-11-06 19:08:12 gente se eu pudesse dar só 1 dica de beauty seria: comprem bio oil
2809 2018-11-06 19:07:59 POLITICAL GROUP POLICIES-8)  "conservative":  Harper- born Toronto, interested in high school politics. Moved to AB at 19 & worked in oil for 3 yrs.   Then Economics Master's degree 1991 at 32 when he was disillusioned with politics, seeing things with Regionalism. NEXT.
2810 2018-11-06 19:07:52 Welp. Might As Well Get My Oil Changed & Tires Rotated While I'm Out Here
2811 2018-11-06 19:07:43 There are major state-level enviro ballot measures this #ElectionDay, but keep your eyes on Measure G in California's San Luis Obispo County. It would ban fracking and new oil and gas wells in the county, and the oil industry has spent more than $45 per voter to fight it.
2812 2018-11-06 19:07:31 Very
2813 2018-11-06 19:07:30 I want to commission an oil painting of this
2814 2018-11-06 19:07:26  oil chafu
2815 2018-11-06 19:07:24 And the refined oil will come back as imported? Poverty Kenya style.
2816 2018-11-06 19:07:18 Umetisha sana master konki konki aka oil chagu
2817 2018-11-06 19:07:15 Those darn pesky regulations! If corporations want to build substandard coal mines, oil pipes, factories, etc. to the detriment of their employees, environment, and Americans, WHO ARE WE TO STOP THEM!?
2818 2018-11-06 19:07:05 No they aren't....I saw lots off oil
2819 2018-11-06 19:06:37 Vote like one of the parties doesn't "believe" in the greatest threat to humanity and essentially values the bank accounts of a bunch of oil execs over you and your family's very existence
2820 2018-11-06 19:06:36 Ya girl finally got her oil changed 
2821 2018-11-06 19:06:33 How many of the respondents would take a holiday within India? How many would go to Gujarat? How many actually know Sardar Patel's contribution? How many vote? Data is the new oil. Fire from oil can cook or equally kill. Let's be careful. #India #IndianHistory #SardarPatel
2822 2018-11-06 19:06:26 What a nonsense statement by Asad Umer that 6 billion dollars received from SA whereas 3 billions deferred payment on oil.  Not a single dollar received from SA from 3 billion dollars.  To whom FM is making fool.  @_Mansoor_Ali @marvisirmed
2823 2018-11-06 19:06:13 Have a little look at Kannaways sample box Lauren 5days supply of CBD Hemp Oil which I find great for anxiety, it comes with a sample of Salve to which is amazing VOGUE Magazine have featured it but yeah that's awesome for acne! Hope this helps, give me a shout 
2824 2018-11-06 19:05:58 Name an alternative oil that uses the same or less land, same or less water and provides the same yield. Yes it damages the environment but so do humans. Palm oil is effcient and can be grown sustainably. The reason it currently isn't? Capitalism, the profit motive.

2826 2018-11-06 19:05:55 There’s something about mashed avocado with a dash of olive oil and salt on a lightly toasted brioche roll that just DOES IT for me

2828 2018-11-06 19:05:46 All the coal station I've been on all burn an oil with the pulverised coal, either heavy or recovered fuel oil
2829 2018-11-06 19:05:22 It's about way more than safer setbacks as well, little buddy. Enjoy your drive to the polls today courtesy of the oil and gas industry.
2830 2018-11-06 19:05:19 Are Africans enjoying the oil boom or are AFRICAN LEADERS enjoying it?
2831 2018-11-06 19:05:10 The point is that we don’t need to invest in oil and gas as renewables are already here, and getting cheaper and more viable by the day. No sense in going further down a road that wrecks the planet any more than we already have.
2832 2018-11-06 19:05:02 Twitter's onslaught on Pakistani accounts on behest of regional headquarter in India and american concessions towards India to buy iranian oil despite sanctions on Iran proves no matter what to whatever extent we PAKIS behave as civilised and peace loving nation
2833 2018-11-06 19:04:54 As a lay person the 2nd I read the story abt this RE deal I knew it was $ laundering & the rest of the world did 2 Why didn't it raise red flags in the US? The Russian tore the house down after the deal was done Neither he or Trump ever lived in it Trump's like oil Nothing sticks
2834 2018-11-06 19:04:51 Dipped my toe in the oil barrel today with members by picking up $UCO. Already +0.60 on it as the PPT Methodology nailed the low within pennies. I gave this level to members a week ago. #ResearchCenter #SwingTrade #Profits
2835 2018-11-06 19:04:48 It's good propaganda. WW1 Tommies died for oil, power, influence and  land grab, not for our freedom as successive governments and others like  to sell it. People don't like to hear that but rudimentary research confirms it as a fact. Service personnel used and abused? You bet.
2836 2018-11-06 19:04:40 Peanut oil
2837 2018-11-06 19:04:34 The Sudis, Iran and Golf States, what are they doing with their oil money?
2838 2018-11-06 19:04:32 The point is that we don’t need to invest in oil and gas as renewables are already here, and getting cheaper and more viable by the day. No sense in going further down a road that wrecks the planet any more than we already have.
2839 2018-11-06 19:04:27 Do you know how difficult it is to put bio oil on the only scar that reminds you of you dead baby..its hard
2840 2018-11-06 19:04:26 My grandma put this anointing oil on my forehead and throughout my hair, it smells sooooo good. 

She said it is the same scent they used to prepare Jesus for his crucifixion.
2841 2018-11-06 19:04:11 They might not be losing if Coutinho still played for them. But they took Barca's money instead. The money Barca made from the over-inflated sale of Neymar to PSG. That's the same PSG who are financed by FFP-busting oil money.
2842 2018-11-06 19:03:57 Pro tip - don’t fry using olive oil
2843 2018-11-06 19:03:44 NAFTA 2.0 is marginally different than NAFTA.  As far as Japan, North Korea, China, Russia, India have shown signs of throwing off the US by selling off most of their US debt holdings moving to gold.  Oil is no longer restricted to the dollar to purchase all bad for us
2844 2018-11-06 19:03:42 There is a thing like groundnut oil beans?
2845 2018-11-06 19:03:38 todos son dolores aca... como la imbecilidad de criticar al fracking por un derrame de oil que ocupaba titulares días atrás. 

LO próximo es el flagelo de la inmigracion a NQN y la falta de escuelas y hospitales y jardines y agua y plazas.... uffff
2846 2018-11-06 19:03:36 Republicans fight dirty: here’s some truth: Republicans obviously don’t give a shit if your children get murdered in school, if insurance companies & banks rip you off, if oil & coal companies kill you slowly, if  foreign governments kill dissenters, or if Russia hacks elections.
2847 2018-11-06 19:03:36 Al Gore is in Colorado trying to promote "clean energy" (Myth)  and close down their productive oil and natural gas  fields! Wotta miserable carpet  bagger!

2850 2018-11-06 19:03:20 Just try ground pepper, salt, oil or butter, and some of the water from the pasta.
Got any garlic/garlic salt/any herbs?
Simple is often the best x
2851 2018-11-06 19:03:18 To many to list but here are a few highlights: Affordable Care Act, Restore Act, Funded Citrus Trust Fund, Sponsored law to not allow offshore oil drilling, introduced legislation to cap interest rates on student loans, help secure funding for hurricane relief...... #FactsMatter
2852 2018-11-06 19:03:15 Cannabis oil 
2853 2018-11-06 19:03:11 You also need to be careful how high you heat olive oil as too high can release carcinogenics
2854 2018-11-06 19:02:59 i’m getting my oil changed and i’m embarrassed bc my fucking car is a mess
2855 2018-11-06 19:02:47 Yes. Reality. The US has NEVER entered a war just to claim the oil.
2856 2018-11-06 19:02:41 Heavy fuel oil - that sounds clean :O)
2857 2018-11-06 19:02:31 Why not engage the NHL, CFL, Professional soccer? As oil and gas capital of Canada why are no energy executives helping negotiate with IOC or leading the charge. Sorry but this is a flawed and poor approach. I am 100% behind the Olympics for Calgary but nothing in this proposal
2858 2018-11-06 19:02:29 I've read about that, as a matter of fact. Therapeutic reasearch or dosing is one thing & looks very good for future. Yes. CBD oil good for PTSD too.
2859 2018-11-06 19:02:28 Whos Billy 
2860 2018-11-06 19:02:27 I was getting my oil changed - where I didn't get scammed by the way - but this fool said he'd change my headlight for $65. Lmao chill bro.
2861 2018-11-06 19:02:25 Ever lost money learning how to cook oil based ?
2862 2018-11-06 19:02:21 In Uganda, we refused this madness and Tullow bolted. No oil is exported till we refine locally, and we have the patience
2863 2018-11-06 19:02:12 leave the potatoes and drink the olive oil
2864 2018-11-06 19:02:06 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avoid multiple hair treatments. Avoid anti-dandruff shampoo. Is it NISIM or NHB? for stopping hair loss. Give or take. How to locate the official web address. Was so good. Really miss it.
2865 2018-11-06 19:01:59 If u just adding some cuz its low w30 wont have any negative impact. Idk the weather report out there but typical rule is heavier the oil, the longer u shud let the car warm up to get the oil flowing properly, so if u been using a 0 weight oil and go to 30 give it a lil xtra time
2866 2018-11-06 19:01:55 My twin granddaughters have the curliest hair.... Its all about the spray in detangler or argan oil.... Then plenty of serum for curly hair..... Easy and no tears or tantrums.... Done in 5mins x
2867 2018-11-06 19:01:33 Put on pants, voted, and got an oil change all before 1. Today is a success no matter what.
2868 2018-11-06 19:01:27 Or we can brush it will oil and grill it over a hardwood fire. It's gonna be delicious.
2869 2018-11-06 19:01:17 @MbSofKSA Why dont you show #US your #ASS and shake hand with #Iran. If #Iran and #KSA are a group whole #Oil will be under this union control. Leave #ISIS and other activists. GIve up 3rd class #US arms and buy #state of the art. #Russian weapons. Otherwise #trump will keep milk
2870 2018-11-06 19:01:15 and if vacancy rates were to decrease, property values would need to go back up, for it to benefit the city Tax wise, the values are not totally related to vacancies, i would imagine values are related to Oil industry, economy in general, among other things.

2874 2018-11-06 19:00:57 What waivers mean for #Iran's oil and gas exports (1/5)
Since this summer, our view at @WoodMackenzie of Iran's #oil exports under sanctions has been of around 1 mbd of crude and 100-250 kbd of condensate on avg (from 5 Nov). Result of work with our oil market expert @WMALHittle
2875 2018-11-06 19:00:56 WHICH seed? Plant oils are all over the place.

More bad news: problem w/"french fries" (chips in some countries) is effect of high heat on oil AND on starches in the potato itself. Produces carcinogens.

Try "air frying" in convection oven at lower temp. Won't be same but safer.
2876 2018-11-06 19:00:54 coconut oil >>>
2877 2018-11-06 19:00:53 Buharists would still argue that PMB is not to blame for oil scarcity  

As usual they would heap the blames on either the previous administration or the middle men

2881 2018-11-06 19:00:28 Their investments in Manchester are undeniably excellent. However again this is soft diplomacy by an oil rich Arab state with a poor human rights record.

2898 2018-11-06 18:58:56 These are good points but not germane to the morality or goals of @extinctsymbol. Don’t create a complex situation from a simple one.

Does palm oil production hurt the environment? 
Yes. 
Ok, what else can we use? 
And let’s don’t use palm oil. 

It’s literally that easy.

2905 2018-11-06 18:58:22 Stacey Abrams in Georgia, since Brian Kemp is such a blatant cheater. Beto is tempting in Texas cause it would be great for Cruz to be out on that oil slick atop his head. Too bad McConnell isn’t running. He’d be at the top of my list.
2906 2018-11-06 18:58:03 Motor oil
2907 2018-11-06 18:58:03 The vote for him for you bc Cruz supports oil rig & refinery jobs but those jobs are killing our planet so it won’t matter if you’re in “parent” shoes bc your kids and their kids generations won’t be able to experience earth bc it’s gonna corrupt!
2908 2018-11-06 18:57:46 In Ohio,  a LOT of people I know heat with wood. The number one reason is COST. They can use their furnace for $400 a month in gas/electric or they can go and chop wood for free all summer long and spend $10 in gas and oil for a chainsaw.  $50 utility bills are nice in December!

2928 2018-11-06 18:54:58 Yep - there was something about meeting with stakeholders - aka oil and gas - before he decides to reverse it.
Well, are the voters/residents all stakeholders?
Go @jaredpolis!

2931 2018-11-06 18:54:39 Used oil smells so good! Thought I was the only one. And the only way to do it is naked less restrictive when moving around

2936 2018-11-06 18:54:23 I’ve got some strong views on this one, not all of which I’d share on here, but Brexit is undoubtedly playing a part in this debacle. Now I want Dundee to get a similar deal to the one Aberdeen got for oil industry downturn.
2937 2018-11-06 18:54:22 Jesus You love me too much oil 
2938 2018-11-06 18:54:18 My prediction. A win will vindicate all negative rhetoric and violence, proving in their minds it works. Expect a lot more of it.

A loss will be an indication intensity of verbal/ physical attacks were lacking, need to be stepped up. Expect a lot more of it.
2939 2018-11-06 18:54:18 Can’t put out no feet pics with the oil patch of hair on the big toe. Don’t need that kind of energy
2940 2018-11-06 18:54:17 It’s more about contact with me than it is about Costco water but no sense in being careless.
2941 2018-11-06 18:54:16 150 political signs for the same Initiative in a two mile stretch up here in Washington paid for by big oil
2942 2018-11-06 18:54:16 That’s the secret to keep it running like a well oiled machine. I put a couple of dollars of gas and don’t change the oil every 3000 miles. 
2943 2018-11-06 18:54:06 Drowning in tea tree oil 
2944 2018-11-06 18:54:01 Needs to be bigger. Not enough jeopardy. Maybe introduce a fire. Or an oil tanker.
2945 2018-11-06 18:53:58 i'm just experimenting lol. last night i made a hair mask. i mixed instant espresso coffee with coconut oil and a little bit of hot water to make a  paste so it wasn't drippy. i massaged it into my hair and scalp and left it on for 30 minutes then washed it out. good results!
2946 2018-11-06 18:53:53 I agree that FFP is a joke, it’s achieved none of the things it was put in place to do. Nonetheless City’s flagrant circumventing of rules is cheating, and we’re city to be anything other than an excercise in soft diplomacy by an oil rich state they would have been taken to task.
2947 2018-11-06 18:53:38 now you say who the crazy here huh the lawn mowers in my backyard who's the crazy here they destroy those lawn mowers we aren't those lawn mowers in Florida I see why black guys don't like living in Georgia I see why they got to get oil out of Georgia order to have something in
2948 2018-11-06 18:53:22 My chakra bracelet pulled me into oncoming traffic. The responding police officer suggested I might use more essential oil next time.
2949 2018-11-06 18:53:16 Guess what I’m doing.... getting an oil change! 

Now where’s that tweet about women not having all 5? I’m ready to respond!
2950 2018-11-06 18:53:15 LOL!
2951 2018-11-06 18:53:08 using the wrong products
before you get any products know your skin type, it’s the best way to know what to use 
dirty pillowcase
your hair has oil that sticks to pillow cases, that oil causes acne, switch your pillow case every 1 week
2952 2018-11-06 18:52:59 Hahaha! I think he's dreaming about the day he's old enough to crawl over and chew that dollhouse you just built.

2955 2018-11-06 18:52:50 (Double fry next time, have faith, frey let sit, get oil bangin' -> fry)
2956 2018-11-06 18:52:46 It's strange but sales of fish oil increased 3 times over the last year. Sales are increasing despite negative research results.  Big money is involved in it.  $AMRN is no exception. #PonziScheme #Drugtests #offlabel #US_FDA #Fraud #AH18
2957 2018-11-06 18:52:46 Funny, this bhakt is pleading to a telecom company and edible oil company
2958 2018-11-06 18:52:45 probably why the only reason my bf won’t break up w me is bc I send him chain texts.
HAPPY HANUKKAH HOE  get ready for 8 nights of sucking DICK!  The Jews escaped the desert on 8 nights of oil  , but you'll do it on 8 nights of CUM ! Shove a DREIDE
2959 2018-11-06 18:52:34 And on another note we shouldn’t even require oil. Look up the water fuel cell or the modified carburetor and what happened to their inventors.
2960 2018-11-06 18:52:34 Shit, my wife better not find out!
2961 2018-11-06 18:52:26 Snake oil klansman should be a word of the day. That's just too good
2962 2018-11-06 18:52:24 CANADA needs it's oil resource big time to keep Canada's economy open.
2963 2018-11-06 18:52:14 see goal wey that guy score una jesuuuu

2966 2018-11-06 18:52:06 My Cretan great-grandmother used to cook huge bowls of french fries in olive oil. She passed away at 88 with near perfect health.
2967 2018-11-06 18:52:04 Yeah my first guess was St. Louis but considering what the Hawks still owe him, wouldn't be surprised to see him take the rest of the year off.
2968 2018-11-06 18:52:01 Some nice bread, olive oil, red wine vinegar, and herbs sounds delicious right now
2969 2018-11-06 18:51:58 Let’s fry panketo therethere’s enough oil

2978 2018-11-06 18:51:18 The 2020 election season starts around midnight tonight and I couldn’t be more tempted to place my head in a pot of boiling canola oil and close the lid
2979 2018-11-06 18:51:16 Fuck yeah. I hate the environment and love oil spills - gop
2980 2018-11-06 18:51:11 turkey breast, gravy, Brussels sprouts in honey chili oil, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce and cornbread

2985 2018-11-06 18:50:45 dinner tonight:
Chicken cooked in breadcrumbs mixed with garlic and herb powder
Cooked in garlic infused oil 
Served with garlic mayo xx
2986 2018-11-06 18:50:44 Works done Started at 5am
Doing a oil change atm then its off to MAGA with my own personal spear for the dems
2987 2018-11-06 18:50:41 Had that. I love cheese but all it was for me was cheese and oil. I was tight.
2988 2018-11-06 18:50:38 or hn baloon mein oil bi lagya kro ................ damagh andr tak khuskh ho gia hai 
2989 2018-11-06 18:50:27 Just say no to peanut oil
2990 2018-11-06 18:50:26 เราเป็นห่วงเก๊กนะ ไม่มีที่พึ่งทั้งทางใจและกายเลย อยู่ด้วยความคิดตัวเองมาตลอด และยิ่งช่วงวัยนี้ มันเป็นเรื่องธรรมดาที่จะคิดอะไรได้สุดๆๆ ทั้งทางดีและไม่ดี บางอย่างมันฝืนชะตาไม่ได้ จงยอมรับ และอยู่กับเรื่องราวที่เข้ามาให้ได้ นะเก๊ก #เก๊กฮวยทานตะวัน
2991 2018-11-06 18:50:24 I got my oil changed at the place I normally go. There was a new guy and he told me that I was going to get the Ladies' Day discount. I thought he was flirting with me in an almost harassing way. Maybe he was but Tuesday really is Ladies'Day, you get 10% off!
2992 2018-11-06 18:50:23 It depends, if a coal station wants to stay hot it doesn't necessarily burn coal, probably heavy fuel oil instead. A station that's 'off' won't spin its steam turbine to generate its own works power, cheaper to pull from the grid and probably don't have the turn down anyway
2993 2018-11-06 18:50:18 Damn it, I was really hoping Rattie can hang out on the 3rd line for a bit. Cagguila looks great on the 1st line.
2994 2018-11-06 18:50:18 Can I lick some of that oil off sweetness
2995 2018-11-06 18:50:13 Allah ya sa albarka ,kinxama inlaw dina
2996 2018-11-06 18:50:12 No. The fatty liver is more likely to be caused by a high sugar/high carbohydrate/high vegetable oil diet. Check blood triglyceride and serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity. If they are dropping your wife is on the right road.
2997 2018-11-06 18:50:09 My car burns oil but it works.
2998 2018-11-06 18:49:55 @Oil_Drop Quenneville will have about half-a-dozen choices instantly. Probably has received calls already from St. Louis and Anaheim.

3004 2018-11-06 18:48:59 so I'm a virgin just like olive oil, but then again she's an extra virgin
3005 2018-11-06 18:48:59 U should have added your alley Erdoghan as No.1 cuz he is the founder and main supporter of ISIS, and all isis members crossed to Syria and Iraq from Turkey airports, but U.S is not blamed, as the adminstration has no principle, but only oil and moeny.
3006 2018-11-06 18:48:55 Will I be able to get "Evil H" beard oil from @hillandhamilton this year for no shave November?
3007 2018-11-06 18:48:35 It certainly would but with the pieces on that roster, it would be awfully enticing. Would never happen but fun to speculate just the same.
3008 2018-11-06 18:48:31 Oil sinks after Trump grants Iran sanctions waivers [ OBAMA IS THE ONE THAT STOPPED THE OIL PIPE LINE FROM ALASKA. TRUMP REOPENED IT UP TO HELP AMERICA NOT TO BE DEPENDENT ON OTHERS.THE BORROWER IS SUBJECT TO THE LENDERS TERMS.
3009 2018-11-06 18:48:30 LRT: congrats on an Italian shorti with oil, lettuce, pickles, oregano, and provolone cheese on winning the US Senate race!
3010 2018-11-06 18:48:25 Build some pipelines maybe we'll be able to afford some renewable infrastructure. You can't print money out of thin air. Meanwhile we buy our oil from a Saudi hitman and environment and people destroyer Venezuela. Maduro the madman loves it.
3011 2018-11-06 18:48:15 Disagree. Greek islanders fry everything in olive oil, and they seem to live long enough. For really scorching stuff, I use hazelnut oil, but olive is fine for a normal fry-up.
3012 2018-11-06 18:48:06 Yeah Commander..what's with the 15th March ?

3015 2018-11-06 18:47:56 Does he think you are a farmer?
3016 2018-11-06 18:47:54 It was a while ago now. I think I tried the blue and purple oils. And also a few different capsules. It must have been for a good 2 to 3 months.  I would be reluctant to use cannabis tbh. Just hope we could have medicinal cannabis oil !!!
3017 2018-11-06 18:47:52 incense, candles and oil diffusers are the wave
3018 2018-11-06 18:47:38 I’m waiting for my oil change and I went to go get my nails done in vermillion Walmart and it’s $28 for a pedicure and $30 for a gel fill. Uhhh no
3019 2018-11-06 18:47:26 Snake oil on the list of products you provide????
3020 2018-11-06 18:47:21 Don't the oil & gas people have children and grandchildren?
3021 2018-11-06 18:47:15 He's one of the corrupt worst autocratic regimes in the world. Russia said it had proof Turkey is involved in ISIS oil trade. Turk president's son heads one of the biggest energy companies, and his son-in-law has been appointed energy minister. What a marvelous family business!

3024 2018-11-06 18:47:05 @simonmayo @jowhiley If you want amazing olive oil and vinegars head to @rushfields_shop just north of Brighton. Their produce is amazing!
3025 2018-11-06 18:46:48 Press the button on your odometer and see what your oil life is. The 3000 miles thing is kinda outdated depending on the kinda oil you use and 200 miles is kinda a lot
3026 2018-11-06 18:46:45 2-3 days make up free. Tea tree oil based face wash. Water till you wanna die. Could also be stress and diet change. So relax and remember what foods broke you out. Hope this helps 
3027 2018-11-06 18:46:45 So... are we gonna wake up tomorrow to a country that accepts bigotry, racism, padding the pockets of the rich, ignores science and continues to destroy the planet, kisses the asses of big oil and the gun lobby, and treats over half our citizens like trash...? Or nah? #GoVote

3030 2018-11-06 18:46:36 Its medicated coconut oil! i used bubble hash some coconut oil and a crock pot!!!
3031 2018-11-06 18:46:36 I remember you mentioning something you had to do. Can't remember what it was tho...
Oil the kitchen worktops? Was that it?
3032 2018-11-06 18:46:29 Saudi Arabia, who is paying us on petrol bill, will pay five years, but when will the oil reach Pakistan and when Pakistan will be cheap in petrol
3033 2018-11-06 18:46:21 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
3034 2018-11-06 18:46:20 Charter schools were a scam; Labour camp perpetrator arrested; Taranaki oil depends on your perspective; CC lost her job; DH emails a storm in a teacup; suicide stats Huh?; MW lost her job; petrol price increase by companies; BC not real data; Kiwibuild is about perspective.
3035 2018-11-06 18:46:19 Ororo no be crude oil ?
3036 2018-11-06 18:46:15 @Oil_Drop After recent troubled years in Chi-Town for Quenneville, it would be like jumping from a burning building into a swamp. Pressure would be incredible.
3037 2018-11-06 18:46:09 Would Canada’s dairy tariffs make it through a WTO challenge if they were initiated today?  Nope.  Would US oil embargo on Iran pass WTO challenge?  Nope.   Does it matter?   Nope.
3038 2018-11-06 18:45:48 The best part of being in a long line of course is standing behind resting bitch face lady smelling like she bathed in mothballs essential oil.
3039 2018-11-06 18:45:39 Really? So Hillary Clinton didn't actively encourage fracking while she was Secretary of State? How many Democrats were even pushed back against for supporting Keystone XL? How many spoke out against the DAPL? How many take money from the oil industry?
3040 2018-11-06 18:45:39 Fracking wastes water, pollutes ground water, causes eartquakes, uses excess energy to produce low quality oil that has to be cleaned by using a polluting refinery. On the positive side it’s cheaper than importing middle eastern oil.
3041 2018-11-06 18:45:27 Unfortunately, the same things that happened the last time I did vote:

-more corporate control
-more military spending
-more wars
-more oil dependency
-more human rights abuses
-more NSA spying
-more private prisons
-more outsourcing of jobs
-more environmental devastation"
3042 2018-11-06 18:45:18 Blue collar, blue vote..was a (R)I usually vote for but the oil and gas companies bought him 2 years ago now he's selling snake oil for them. Lost my support and it's solid blue to the finish line.

3050 2018-11-06 18:44:38 So I had a good friend that was a mechanic & he said that the "every 3 months or 3 thousand miles" is just something they tell you to get you to spend more $$, the max to go is 5000 with out one & even then if you put oil or check it regularly you might can go longer :)
3051 2018-11-06 18:44:36 A country where u hear

3061 2018-11-06 18:43:54 Oil is down 20% in the last month. I'm still waiting for gas prices to go down in Las Vegas, NV. Gas prices haven't gone down here at all.
3062 2018-11-06 18:43:53 I use Epanouie's Milk Cleanser in the daytime and Aveeno's Clear Complexion Cleanser at night. I also use Epanouie's   Oil Cleanser along with the Milk cleanser if I'm wearing makeup.
3063 2018-11-06 18:43:49 If anyone likes old master oil paintings I can do them and at low cost copies  ...won't post in Twitter as copyright infringement but I can send examples with email
3064 2018-11-06 18:43:48 We can't pay for renewables if we can't sell our oil at a reasonable price. You people think money can be printed out of thin air. You buying the oil from a Saudi hitman and environment destroyer Venzuela instead!
3065 2018-11-06 18:43:46 Getting my oil changed at @jiffylube and one of the employees here walked up and gave a homeless dude a cup of coffee. Humanity, you’re beautiful. Keep caring for others, keep showing love. We all need more of that.

3067 2018-11-06 18:43:33 Sir do you think Israel needs an explanation of why are we still importing oil from Iran.
3068 2018-11-06 18:43:15 Both Koreans (for Korean Fried Chicken, aka Chimaek) and Italians (for Battered Fish) use Virgin or Refined Olive Oil, not Extra Virgin.  The results are fantastic.

3071 2018-11-06 18:43:04 There was a time in this country, 400,000 barrels of oil used to disappear daily.
Never again.

3072 2018-11-06 18:43:04 Where the money go come from? What do we export apart from oil? What else do we export that makes sense?please be real. State governments can’t pay the present minimum wage.
3073 2018-11-06 18:42:39 Ever notice the amount of #agtech snake oil isn't slowing down
3074 2018-11-06 18:42:34 And no olive oil?
3075 2018-11-06 18:42:30 I used it twice daily. You can add tissue/bio oil to increase its potency
3076 2018-11-06 18:42:22 Fry some onion in oil then add it to a slow cooker. Brown sausages all over in the same frying pan and add to the SC. Put some tomato purée, Worcestershire Sauce, 250ml boiling water in the frying pan. Mix it all up and tip the lot into the slow cooker. Cook on high 4 hrs.

3078 2018-11-06 18:42:19 The Price Is Right Live - Stage Show is November 13th. If you would like to WIN 2 tickets, get the price right on a Medium Cappaccino at Allen Oil Co. of Sylacauga, Inc. Brewmarkets: is it a) $1.29  b) $1.39  c) 1.49 or d) $1.59 (plus tax)? FIRST Correct answer wins!
3079 2018-11-06 18:42:19 It is clear. Vote against white supremacy, against racism, against child separation. Against overt lying, ignorance, stupidity (okay those were all aimed at Trump specifically). Big oil, and so, so many other hallmarks of the current day Republican party
3080 2018-11-06 18:42:03 The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world. But Venezuela don't have control over oil price. Same thing is with Ripple, they can't control the price of #XRP.

3085 2018-11-06 18:41:29 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3086 2018-11-06 18:41:28 The data comes from the Danish, Norwegian, Canadian, and US governments for the most part; and the authors of the cited studies are Canadians working for Canadian universities. No "oil funded climate denial think tank" in sight, so you are engaging in more disinformation.
3087 2018-11-06 18:41:16 Babcock comes across as being unwilling to adapt and following that marketplace as I do, it's something everyone sees it but many want no part of bringing it up. As good a coach as Babcock is, he hasn't won anything in a very long time...as I don't count the Olympics.
3088 2018-11-06 18:41:11 You don’t need to jump out until oil peaks at the end of nov.
3089 2018-11-06 18:41:05 Yesterday I got my new tires, oil change, and alternator switched out. I feel so independent lmao
3090 2018-11-06 18:41:00 All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals (mostly a silicate, such as quartz), while retaining the original structure of the stem tissue. It is even more mineral than oil.

3096 2018-11-06 18:40:45 IMO moving from gold to the dollar for international settlements was a big one. After the initial Nixon/oil shocks global supply smoothed.

3098 2018-11-06 18:40:33 Can you do that without high heat? I thought you can't put high heat on olive oil?
3099 2018-11-06 18:40:30 It would be a pleasure, ill dig out some old baking trays to catch the oil drips! Only joking. Let us know when you are planning a visit and we would love to have you here.  Cheers you and ride safe

3101 2018-11-06 18:40:27 Try putting a teaspoon of olive oil in your ear and lying down on your side for 10 minutes. Weirdest feeling but doctors recommend it to clear anything after a cold!
3102 2018-11-06 18:40:26 @IanCheeseman Ian, just tell Robbie Savage that there wouldn’t even be a combined 11 - it’s like mixing oil and water!! #mcfc
3103 2018-11-06 18:40:25 @Adam_Penning  hey Adam went to your talk up in the Black Country the other week and was really interested in the boilie crumb you talked about, what would you add to it in the winter instead of oil mate ? And would you use it on a mixed fishery such as dovecote?
3104 2018-11-06 18:40:20 I’m watching a video of an experiment and this bitch is filling up one glass with olive oil and another with honey and I’m just sat here screaming at her cos of how expensive those two are... I need help
3105 2018-11-06 18:40:15 I got my oil changed and made tea to sit down and work on this manuscript and then I started having political throw downs on here.

Send help.

3109 2018-11-06 18:39:52 No. As long as the temperature does not fall the steam keeps exiting the fries preventing the oil from entering and making the fries soggy.
3110 2018-11-06 18:39:49 I fuckin' killed the oil short man.. Good job me. I was the lonely one shorting it when everyone was so bullish on oil. It's fuckin inflated price man. If slowdown is here, i am wondering where 10y note is heading. Stay tuned!!!!
3111 2018-11-06 18:39:44 You know it’s basketball season when you are getting a oil change And a employee stops what he is doing just to talk shit  lol  that #Duke hate is real I love it tho!!!! #EmbraceTheHate  #DukeNation
3112 2018-11-06 18:39:41 Me too, the waiting is frustrating but in line with BOD predictions. Q1 2019 for first oil is not so far away, and this time next year we will all hopefully be sitting on a big pile of post asset sale cash !
3113 2018-11-06 18:39:36 This is not new.  Oil and gas companies demand to be rewarded for their business activity in Alberta.  Provincial government always complied   That is the way that it was and is.  Now......do not count on Trudeau .......early on he made his couched remarks on AB OS oil cdnpoli
3114 2018-11-06 18:39:34 Bih can’t een change ya oil, tf you gone build. 
3115 2018-11-06 18:39:20 Yes well McKenna worked for the UN to ratify oil deals in East Timor so not surprised she now works for the Chinese government. It makes perfect sense. #TrudeauMustGo #TrudeauGrope
3116 2018-11-06 18:39:16 It should have been more on this news. Apparently oil money is covering up the news Chanel's too.
3117 2018-11-06 18:39:15 the so called "fund" is s fiction

SS payments come out of Federal funds just like any expenditure

all they have to do is STOP SUBSIDIZING BIG OIL, BIG PHARMA AND BIG AGRICULTURE and there will be plenty of money for Social Security

3120 2018-11-06 18:39:01 Yeah, they were basically kicked out of Seattle by the fire marshal because of the oil drum fires and fire jugglers, eaters, blowers. Thank gawd they did break up before poi got big. They would have burned down the whole west coast.
3121 2018-11-06 18:38:59 Everywhere you look in CO people are SCREAMING "no on 112!!!!!" because its "going to destroy jobs!!!!!!" when the text of the prop is just saying you're not allowed to build oil facilities within like 2500 feet of an occupied building like a school or a library
3122 2018-11-06 18:38:55 I Voted, Got my Plane ticket got my bday trip , and got my Passport Application and a Oil Change. Errands were a success

3124 2018-11-06 18:38:54 Indomie and kerosene lol. I was too broke and hungry I mistakenly poured kerosene instead of oil in it. I was too hungry I had to eat it like that.
3125 2018-11-06 18:38:46 When you'd be doing like oil.
3126 2018-11-06 18:38:42 Feeling ko yung rationale on that is kapag hot, tapos yung problen nga is that your oil glands are clogged, the heat from the compress helps thin out yung clogged oils. Tapos the heat can also help your muscles relax, as well as promote circulation :)
3127 2018-11-06 18:38:40 It is shanklish (Lebanese kind of cheese) with tomato, green pepper and of course olive oil

3133 2018-11-06 18:37:58 I have just found the email address of the Pain Management consultant that I saw in Feb when I asked about CBD oil. At the time he said he didn't know enough about it. I have just sent him the link to the above findings. Also sent him the endocannabinoid deficiency report link.
3134 2018-11-06 18:37:57 Voted YES on 1631 2 weeks ago b4 big oil sent out those no on 1631 brochures 4 times.  Think of all that no on 1631 four color paper in the landfill for a YES vote.
3135 2018-11-06 18:37:51 This might be THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE ON THE BALLOT. Proud to vote yes on Proposition 112: Minimum Distance Requirements for New Oil, Gas, and Fracking Projects Initiative. This is a vote for the environment, for the future, for health and safety #prop112 #proposition112
3136 2018-11-06 18:37:50 I'll agree that record high oil prices saved us. That isn't something anyone can bank on though. It was pure dumb luck
3137 2018-11-06 18:37:47 @Oil_Drop Quenneville undisputed as a great coach, but why better for Leafs than Babcock at this time? Change (or even consideration) would open big can of worms.
3138 2018-11-06 18:37:42 Wrong, solar is now cheapest. 300 million in India too remote.  Building roads n making them buy oil n coal is too expensive.  Why do u want to deny them the ability to generate their own electricity using renewable technology?
3139 2018-11-06 18:37:39 if you're concerned about gas prices then you should call and write your representitives and tell them you are against waging unending wars in foreign countries. and that oil for guns, or oil for rebellions is not acceptable policy.
3140 2018-11-06 18:37:39 Yes! If you want to make it more potent, add tissue/bio oil
3141 2018-11-06 18:37:39 Babe bought me lunch, had lunch with me and took my car for an oil change 
3142 2018-11-06 18:37:28 Everything is cheaper in USA , I know cuz I go to MI every quarter. So do you have a carbon tax on small biz and food, oil, gas, heating, everything you buy? We will here & poor, seniors, disabled will be greater affected, also small biz that are competing w USA w lower Trump tax
3143 2018-11-06 18:37:14 definitely*

see: Washington's modest carbon fee-for-green-reinvestment and the $30m oil money against it.

3150 2018-11-06 18:36:48 Never heat oil. Except before massaging a pretty woman
3151 2018-11-06 18:36:48 No, I’ve never worked for govt, I’m oil sands dude. Fortunately I work for a company that is actively working to do exactly what Gil suggests and that’s to adapt and address the new paradigm we face. Remember, it wasn’t long ago that the EU wanted to entirely ban our “dirty oil”
3152 2018-11-06 18:36:45 These are the worst. Put a warm compress on it for 5-10min. The warmth brings the pus to the surface and dissolve the pus/oil naturally. That are a warm (Black) tea bag - helps reduce swelling w/ antibacterial properties 
3153 2018-11-06 18:36:30 Crude oil. Literally ugly.
3154 2018-11-06 18:36:26 The word they're looking for is indoctrinated.
3155 2018-11-06 18:36:23 U know. Today i found some amazing info about fish oil. Tests were conducted on rats. Fish oil accelerated oxidative processes that usually begin in old age. #US_FDA #NYSE #offlabel #Malpractice #ClinicalTrialFake #amarin #vascepa #fishoil
3156 2018-11-06 18:36:22 Don’t French fries need to be cooked at high heat and olive oil has a low smoke point...thus, damaging the oil?
3157 2018-11-06 18:36:20 Sounds about right, yeah. Although the oil boom brought a lot of new people up here including a more diverse racial mix.

Unfortunately I'm pretty sure that having a bunch of non-white people moving here from out of state just makes white people MORE racist.

3159 2018-11-06 18:36:05 Yet allowing exceptions to let some nations continue buying Iranian oil. #hypocrite
3160 2018-11-06 18:35:48 What garbage speak is this? 

They always direct people to act unnaturally and imagine/dream/act as if/, instead being a human being and accepting reality.
3161 2018-11-06 18:35:45 Just finished speaking with reporters about the renewed US sanctions on Iran’s oil and shipping industries in Ankara, Turkey.
3162 2018-11-06 18:35:37 And those gold diggers dog until they find oil
3163 2018-11-06 18:35:36 Might be early but bought some April $uco $27 calls just now on oil.  I'm thinking the President and Saudi flooded the market before the election and #iran waivers will keep the price down for now, but there will be a supply issue early 2019.
3164 2018-11-06 18:35:29 Are you going to stop killing Orangutans? Using H&S, putting your name against a product that uses an awful lot of palm oil?
3165 2018-11-06 18:35:18 President @mbuhari approves #30,000 as the new minimum wage.

During the time oil price was good PDP led Govt. couldn't achieve this, but with less PMB has shown his readiness for second term in office.

3168 2018-11-06 18:34:50 Beware toxic fumes from heating olive oil!
3169 2018-11-06 18:34:34 Eric has personal problem with shampoo.  He probably mixes it with water to make a bubble blowing solution.  Wash some of that oil out of your hair ffs

3172 2018-11-06 18:34:28 I’m originally from Ontario (kinda, lived here as a kid), moved to AB over a decade ago. The writing is on the wall in that the world is changing. Do you think it’s coincidence that “oil companies” don’t exist anymore? They are “energy companies” now. Times are changing.
3173 2018-11-06 18:34:26 Bro oil wey dey your head dey dry

3176 2018-11-06 18:34:00 Getting my oil changed and I just handed sample ballots to all the employees. Also told them about their rights to stay in line and vote if they are still in line at 7:30. Take every opportunity! #GOTV

3178 2018-11-06 18:33:31 Shoprite has two kinds. The expensive kind, i forget the name, green box k60. Chisamba oil less than k40 i believe. Also, Kamwala i think Fort Jameson. And Shoprite has coconut oil in the cooking oil aisle. Adam's spice shop has the other kind (medicinal/hair). In town
3179 2018-11-06 18:33:19 Another asset bites the dust, WTI crude oil hit a bear market decline of 20% today in the generic contract

3186 2018-11-06 18:32:35 Lol gas prices have dropped incredibly over the last month and will continue too. Check all the graphs and charts online you will not find one showing them higher today than even last week. During corrections oil always spikes. I know this debate is over...
3187 2018-11-06 18:32:29 Strome defensive minded might work in the middle. Two kids that probably think alike might work. At least if presented with a chance they can score. But then again it is the oilers. I’ll say it again full time job tone an oilers fan.
3188 2018-11-06 18:32:25 that's my best case scenario. i am really worried about rates. Infra/taxCut2 would destroy everything via much higher yields. maybe 4% on 30y
Gridlock means no more deficit crap and NQ can confidently go up while nominals and USD go lower so that the RoW can enjoy lower oil
3189 2018-11-06 18:32:21 Why would he retire? He can make 6 million a year just for showing up. Best outcome for the Oilers would be a career ending injury with him going on LTIR.

3193 2018-11-06 18:31:43 Im afraid so! £277 for a gallon of oil and a paper filter because @vauxhall don’t deem the Adblue to be part of the service! You’d be gutted if I didn’t bleed your rads or clean your filter on a boiler service because the manufacturer didn’t say it was required!

3204 2018-11-06 18:31:08 The week in review: unoriginal cubist photography, Banksy's crude oil and revealing Morocco at the V&A
3205 2018-11-06 18:31:02 Y'all think I'm playin', ima be like the nigga with the Kente oil in his hair 
3206 2018-11-06 18:31:00 Did you know that oil stains can be removed from the carpet with baking soda?
Oh, baking soda... what CAN'T you do?!
3207 2018-11-06 18:30:59 Oil money too sweet
3208 2018-11-06 18:30:55 idk if my bro accidentally sent his shopping list to our family group chat but he just randomly texted all of us “CBD oil” 
3209 2018-11-06 18:30:53 Because it really wouldn’t be a week if there wasn’t someone trying to sell us on $100 oil
3210 2018-11-06 18:30:52 Things I’ve learnt this week:
1. Oil money is not real money
2. Only city have ever had a cash injection
3. Sterling salary has ruined football
4. There is no corruption in footy just city
5. FFP is legit
6. Other attempts to get round FFP are not the same, as city was way more

3213 2018-11-06 18:30:50 I had to start broiling then and putting some olive oil on them
3214 2018-11-06 18:30:48 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.
3215 2018-11-06 18:30:47 Thank you! We were able to trace this problem to an oil issue that hopefully has been resolved
3216 2018-11-06 18:30:36 This all BS...Iran has never quite shipping oil. Been all lies to get the price off oil up...PERIOD...BIG OIL FLEECING EVERYONE...!!!

3223 2018-11-06 18:29:59 The lady in the express oil change waiting room is spouting her Facebook conspiracy theories to some random guy that’s also waiting

3226 2018-11-06 18:29:38 I base my hair with coconut oil. I haven't found a stable hair product to use but I use the organics shampoo and conditioner. I stretch my hair by plating it ka wool every night.
3227 2018-11-06 18:29:35 2/ The early 50s Liberal government established the KM pipe that is still operating.

3243 2018-11-06 18:28:35 Would a tariff on imported oil make it through a WTO challenge? I rather doubt it. Furthermore, your assertion that "western Canada" (aka Alberta) is at the bottom of a list is ludicrous. At some political cost, the government has purchased KM's TM assets. /2

Heading to the great state of Texas! Under republican leadership and mostly thanks to #realDonaldTrump, They are the worlds third largest producer of oil: 1. USA 2. Russia 3. Texas 4. Obama’s favorite country, Iran God bless Texas!
3245 2018-11-06 18:27:49 Some of the hysteria I’m reading this morning cracks me up. Get them sheep worked up and see how much money they can trick them into giving them on false hope. Snake oil salesmen, all them and the media too.
3246 2018-11-06 18:27:49 Don’t you work in the most subsidized industry in the history of human civilization.
3247 2018-11-06 18:27:47 Subpoenaed Russian companies 4 the invasion of r elections. If they don't appear 4 questioning dsn't mean nothing is being done. Not sure how u r not getting Trump is all about U.S. sovereignty when he demontrates it constantly. Independence from foreign interference, oil, etc.
3248 2018-11-06 18:27:21 Most people don't know how to do it. The worst part is that they make use of bad groundnut oil instead of the refined ones. But some do it well anyway.
3249 2018-11-06 18:27:17 Propostion 112 is really important and a matter to take seriously #oil #112 #makecoloradonumber1again
3250 2018-11-06 18:27:04 New boss actually does car inspections. Whelp... time to fix my wipers, change this oil, get new tires, and actually clean the fucking thing.
3251 2018-11-06 18:26:58 I remember two years ago when your stupid magazine ran articles calling for PROTECTIVE TARIFFS for the protection of domestic oil production from foreign competition.
3252 2018-11-06 18:26:52 I probably wouldn't mind a carbon tax if we could compete with countries that don't have one but we can't. Maybe if we had some pipelines we could ship our oil at world prices and actually afford a modest tax.
Right now our oil cos.cant afford it. Nor can we.
3253 2018-11-06 18:26:46 so while I'm getting an oil change, I was walking around Wal-Mart to get ideas. I want a kayak. too much. i want a fishing pole, but dont have a friend with a boat to go fishing, charters supply you with one, I dont know a thing about fishing poles...
3254 2018-11-06 18:26:30 Eucalyptus! I diffuse the oil and breathe it in. It rids sinus infections, too. And echinacea tea with honey.
3255 2018-11-06 18:26:27 Hahahahaha that pup looks like a oil painting of an Aristocrat from the 1400’s!!!

3257 2018-11-06 18:26:25 Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh made important remarks today on the effect of US sanctions on the oil market, saying there will be hard days ahead for consumers & that Trump is artificially keeping prices low.
3258 2018-11-06 18:26:15 In a perfect world, had they kept actual wingers who can contribute, that set up could work with RNH in the middle.
3259 2018-11-06 18:26:12 Because you have been told to and dont research just listen to propaganda. Equivalent to why does Canada buy foreign oil at top prices but ignores our own oil. Basically every product is foreign but we ignore our own. Hmm

3267 2018-11-06 18:25:46 Skillet with some olive oil, gives you a touch of crunch in the crust
3268 2018-11-06 18:25:30 I think if we can be invaded by other countries we should just walk into other south American countries and start taking there oil and resources.
Illegals are taking our taxpayer money and using our resources water, gas & oil.
Lowering our wages, rasing crime and murder rates
3269 2018-11-06 18:25:26 You might want to ask Mrs. Trump how stripping naked and rubbing oil all over her boy for girl on girl photo is talent 'cuz it got her a "Genius Visa"

3271 2018-11-06 18:25:11 Nothing wrong with mourning the fallen. The Second World War was against facism and actually meant something. Where as now our soldiers are dying over oil and the lack of resources we have as a country. Yes remember, but also remember the women n children that die at our hands
3272 2018-11-06 18:24:59 Liberals have lost all logic and will not see the truth until they are smacked in the face with the UN Agenda!! The economy is being burned down, oil industry crippled and illegals pouring in and housed in Hotels. Canadians are homeless and hungry!! Wake up educate yourself!!
3273 2018-11-06 18:24:56 me thinks there will hell of short squeeze on oil before it goes further down. this would be to obvious.
3274 2018-11-06 18:24:50 Irving was a partner because it was going to offer terminal services. A carbon levy on imported oil would likely not pass WTO rules.
3275 2018-11-06 18:24:42 Usually though it also means well taken care of. Car service on time, oil changed etc
3276 2018-11-06 18:24:41 Oil factory....
3277 2018-11-06 18:24:39 This ministry will never lack anointing oil 
3278 2018-11-06 18:24:32 i would smoke him under the table in probably less than two. i would have to bring dab oil as i don't do smoke from leaf/hash any longer. And 94%thc dab oils would crinkle his noggin pretty quick.
3279 2018-11-06 18:24:26 South Indians celebrate the previous day (today for us), when the demon narakasur was defeated by Krishna and Satyabhama. It was done in the early hours of the morning. So wake up before the sun, and an oil massage and hot shower, new clothes, snacks, and fireworks.

3288 2018-11-06 18:23:41 WTI crude fell 2%, touching $61.31, levels last seen in March. Supply concerns due to the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports have subsided, as waivers to Iran clients such as South Korea and Japan will allow Iranian crude to keep flowing, for now.

3292 2018-11-06 18:23:19 Socialism, no company or industry left standing:

Venezuela, the country with the world’s largest oil reserves, has seen its production fall to 1.2 million barrels a day today from 3.2 million barrels in 2006, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

3305 2018-11-06 18:21:37 Spot on! Trump doesn't give two f*cks about Iran. Just a great oil manipulation vehicle.
3306 2018-11-06 18:21:34 Just like his Dad, disregarded Canada’s oil patch. Obviously he does not realize the contributions of our Western provinces.

3309 2018-11-06 18:21:21 Ted Cruz's family was in the oil industry and he's attended private schools for nearly all his life, and his wife is an investment manager at Goldman Sachs. Your statement wasn't enlightening, it isn't weird to be married to a person with a successful family.
3310 2018-11-06 18:21:14 The Benin Kingdom was an independent Kingdom and traded heavily in Palm Oil and Ivory, the British didn't like it and wanted to see the Oba and he refused, he said he was busy so they sent him a stick as an insult so he had the oyibo messengers killed then they invaded in 1897.
3311 2018-11-06 18:21:11 Yesterday I went grocery shopping, my oil changed and then today I went to go vote. This is what I call successful adulting  #GoVote
3312 2018-11-06 18:21:05 Exactly, there's so much literature that shows it works. Where's the literature that says it's snake oil??
3313 2018-11-06 18:21:02 You let the tea trea oil sit on it? It’s okay for it to get inside the piercing?

3320 2018-11-06 18:20:35 Need an oil change like ASAP.

3328 2018-11-06 18:19:21 Oil runs around a lot,and can lack a bit of direction,and his end product isn’t always there yet,but give me Oli any day of the week over that lazy mercenary Ayew,and his equally greedy brother.All that’s bad in football from two brothers.

3330 2018-11-06 18:19:08 US sourced crude might come to represent the most under-realized real return value in the human history of trade. While the rest of the world strives to profit from oil, the US driller seems determined to prove he can make the least amount possible for every bbl sold. Bizarre.
3331 2018-11-06 18:19:07 I need an oil change

3337 2018-11-06 18:18:45 Thankssssssss. They should let you out to vote, or maybe you vote by mail? I bet snakes vote for something better than snake oil salesmen!

3340 2018-11-06 18:18:39 Agreed. Just stop buying their oil, then they won’t have the money to buy weapons and fight a war.
3341 2018-11-06 18:18:36 I'm very tempted to suggest Green Tea, coconut oil and Kale. Don't the fix everything according to the interwebs? Seriously though, no idea. Bio oil? Vaseline?

3347 2018-11-06 18:18:01 I started using lavender and lemon oil along with aloe on my skin and just wow
3348 2018-11-06 18:18:01 we forgot oil and it tasted like a dry garbage can
3349 2018-11-06 18:18:00 woke up with anxiety this morning so my first thought was to change the vibes in my room, so i turned on my scentsy and put patchouli rose oil in it.

10/10 feel so much better
3350 2018-11-06 18:17:54 I quite the full story is it. Rising oil price, environmental levies, rises under Labour, and we still have below average energy prices for Europe. This cap is a good thing.
3351 2018-11-06 18:17:50 My dad used to put peanut/vegetable oil on my salads (I like a very basic oil/vinegar dressing). I knew from the first bite how badly he’d messed up (AGAIN).

I was too young to buy olive oil. Not because it’s illegal, but because I didn’t have any money.

Anyway. I fired him.
3352 2018-11-06 18:17:40 Ended up funny. *shrugs*

3359 2018-11-06 18:16:58 It's not a bitter rivalry it's a local rivalry. They've only been relevant since they became oil sluts.
3360 2018-11-06 18:16:51 During GEJ's era, crude oil was fluctuating $90-$120 per barrel, yet he and his cabal squandered everything and left us with nothing. No infrastructure, no security, no nothing. Buhari sells @ $35 for many months, yet achieved so much with so little.
3361 2018-11-06 18:16:44 Just had an oil change not too long ago, so should be good there?
3362 2018-11-06 18:16:42 See oil

3367 2018-11-06 18:16:03 We need three approaches if humans are to survive. First, we need to scale up remedies (trees) to the problems caused by fossil fuels. Second we need to scale up “alternatives (wind and solar) to fossil fuels. Third and most important, we need to scale down oil companies.
3368 2018-11-06 18:15:57 Even with clear evidence of their slavish devotion to whitewashing City & unlooking of their doctoring of books? You believe top managers are on the take but you are saying someone shouldn't believe struggling journalists cannot be bought with oil money? LOL.
3369 2018-11-06 18:15:55 Okay! So Italy is the open harbor for EU for the Iranian Oil. This is also the country were China does have a lot of harbor... Totally make sense. Trump does has a weird way to fight China and Russia 
3370 2018-11-06 18:15:54 No it’s likely weak sellers also, @angloafricanog have been good with keeping us updated. Once we see R1/2 oil, sentiment and the herd will follow. Low float and a coiled spring imo, FOMO for a lot on the sidelines
3371 2018-11-06 18:15:43 Data is the new oil. I hope that don’t go over y’all heads.

3377 2018-11-06 18:15:03 Coca Cola is great for cleaning metal, cleaning your bathroom, and removing oil stains from your driveway. It's not fit for human consumption.
3378 2018-11-06 18:15:03 But South Korea was one of Asia's poorest countries, and look at it now! Dubai was originally a piece of desert with a few small buildings on it, and look at it now! Meanwhile Nigeria is rich in oil but "supposedly" can't even afford to equip its troops.
3379 2018-11-06 18:15:01 I wish I knew how to fuckin change my oil
3380 2018-11-06 18:14:59 If Heitcamp actually holds on it will be a miracle...

Mind you, in ND I think a significant chunk of the youth vote could be going to Trump (oil industry jobs and such)
3381 2018-11-06 18:14:57 Just the amount of money that big Oil was spending here in WA would have been enough for me to know to vote for 1631.

Honestly, I'm waiting for the oil industry to start using reverse psychology, saying they SUPPORT such measures, getting us to doubt them.
3382 2018-11-06 18:14:55 Voting blue and not supporting a murderous oil rich regime makes you decent
3383 2018-11-06 18:14:34 Does that include the ones who died from net neutrality/ACA mandate/tax cuts/Paris accords/oil pipelines/etc?
3384 2018-11-06 18:14:26 And the worse option NEVER sits.
3385 2018-11-06 18:14:19 Oil changes are so expensive ughhh
3386 2018-11-06 18:14:13 How safe will we be when the Frontier oil sands mine helps bump us over 2 degrees of warming @TeckResources?

Spare us your propaganda. Your company is complicit in a global crisis...
3387 2018-11-06 18:14:10 Neither does sitting young players send the right message when there is a worst player to sit. 
But then again is a decade+ long issue with this team. No wonder this team struggles to develop young players. I'd say fuck this shit too when I'm benched for a worse option.

3391 2018-11-06 18:13:34 You think they want us to bend over so OPEC can continue raping us instead of tapping domestic oil reserves? So dumb! Democrats have never done crap for Native Americans except expect their votes. They want economic freedom, and to protect their homeland illegal foreign invaders.
3392 2018-11-06 18:13:28 And you are naive.  Do you expect renewables to bring the revenues and the jobs that O&G does now?  Demand for oil is not going to slow any time soon.  We have tech we can share to make the extraction process cleaner.  Let’s shift to renewables slowly without killing our economy.
3393 2018-11-06 18:13:21 Carter screwed up the hostage rescue (military failure) and told people to wear sweaters when the oil crisis hit. 
HW Bush lost by 6 million votes.  But Ross Perot drained 19 million votes. Yes A third party candidate got 20% of vote.  That's why they lost.
3394 2018-11-06 18:13:19 Is there oil/fuel in it?
3395 2018-11-06 18:13:19 A variation of different meats (shaki, beef, cowfoot & smoked turkey) with pepper & palm oil, depends where you get it from tho cos some make it differently.
3396 2018-11-06 18:13:16 I'm not being sarcastic, but try a bottle of beard oil...
3397 2018-11-06 18:13:12 Can US oil production help with that like we are doing with LNG?

3403 2018-11-06 18:12:24 Been suffering with Anxiety and Depression for long time now. On meds which help my mood. I had seen ppl suggest CBD oil. I was very sceptical to begin with.

3410 2018-11-06 18:10:50 Face oil ku mau habis dan aku masih pengangguran bagaimana ini 
3411 2018-11-06 18:10:38 Yes but accountable to what? If you are talking accountability among players, that only matters if we are talking about an effort issue and that's not what this is. Last year, yes but not now. Hence why if the goal is to send said message, sitting Lucic doesn't do it.
3412 2018-11-06 18:10:32 tbh i didnt understand a lot of the amendment thingies other than the lrt mentioned one, the end dog racing one, and the one that grouped vaping and fucking oil drilling together
3413 2018-11-06 18:10:27 Alaskans own 273,094 shares of ROSNEFT OIL CO PJSC, worth $1,558,157. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in RUSSIA.

3425 2018-11-06 18:09:30 From here on the ball is into the short-side players if they want to really dog the oil price.

3426 2018-11-06 18:09:12 lmao I've tried  when he had a glass bowl and then a stainless steel one, he wouldn't eat it because he couldn't tip it. He won't eat wet food either or dry food soaked in fish oil because it doesn't tip as easily  It's so weird
3427 2018-11-06 18:09:10 Oh, Florida Man!
3428 2018-11-06 18:09:03 I have been here for about a year and half and only heard him talk about oil changes once. The other truck has a misfire and a possible hole in the manifold or elsewhere in the exhaust. But not my vehicle and not my business so not my problem.
3429 2018-11-06 18:08:53 The projects sittingbon the sidelines in the Oil industry is around the 150 billion dollar $$. No pipelines no expansion or projects. Keep the Saudi oil pouring into Canada. Maybe one day someone will wake up. This black cloud is only going to get worse and it’s here for awhile
3430 2018-11-06 18:08:45 CBD oil
3431 2018-11-06 18:08:43 Oil free everything baby girl. Switch to an oil free face wash and make up wipes and you’ll be good to go. That’s how I do it. Of course you’ll lose some but not as much and try to use oil free make up !
3432 2018-11-06 18:08:40 Angolo-Persian (not Iranian)Co.was a British company. Mosadegh requested a share more than total revenue of this co. Mosadegh cut oil export to UK and US. and refused any sujestion from US. For more inf. Please read Prize book. by D.Yergin.
3433 2018-11-06 18:08:36 he actually just used a pan & vegetable oil!
3434 2018-11-06 18:08:29 apparently the 9th graders here was trying to get vegetable oil on the floor... even I wasn’t that bad as a 9th grader.. I was just cringe, I mean I still am but—
3435 2018-11-06 18:08:27 Begs the only important question, as obviously US producers will blow their brains out on production, even if they have to pay people to take their oil...what does OPEC+ think of this inventory projection?

3437 2018-11-06 18:08:22 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3438 2018-11-06 18:08:13 Further, big oil and ranching concerns are not congruent, so just lessening regs will nilly is not as popular as one might think. I think we all know how happy FL is with the prospect of offshore drilling, and anyone nominally awake knows fracking is a large NO.
3439 2018-11-06 18:07:57 So some people dey use groundnut oil cook beans. God end it now 
3440 2018-11-06 18:07:55 O/N Wrap:
Most (but not all) markets on hold awaiting the outcome of the US #Midterms2018; price action at #GDT auction negative (again) with a 2% fall; oil continued to come off the boil, a 2.5% fall for black gold; #NZD eyeing employment data at 10:45.
3441 2018-11-06 18:07:47 Maybe I should take one for the team just to get xrapid oil transactions going 
3442 2018-11-06 18:07:35 What a waste of oil to light up 3 lacs diyas in ayodhya, waste of oil , highest populated state, lowest direct and indirect taxes , whose budget are they spending, tax payers money, not yogis money, honestly will God Ram would be seeing the poverty & corruption in the State
3443 2018-11-06 18:07:27 I have been neglecting to goodness of this oil , my family will not get eat it , so i kinda " let it go". BUT it's back on the shopping list next week!
3444 2018-11-06 18:07:26 Pete Davidson makes a joke: nation outaged

@DanCrenshawTX participated in an immoral war for oil and murdered who knows how many people so the white elite can line their pockets: He’s an American Hero
3445 2018-11-06 18:07:19 So it's bad for the environment because of the palm oil, right? And many beauty products are still tested on animals  Including Pantene

3449 2018-11-06 18:07:00 more time various meats like shaki and ponmon, all your standard peppers, palm oil etc
3450 2018-11-06 18:06:59 oil vape
3451 2018-11-06 18:06:59 A vote for Red Tide Rick is a vote for oil rigs on Florida's coastline.
3452 2018-11-06 18:06:54 It's not about Lucic........it's about EVERY player knowing and seeing players not be held accountable who should be. Sends the wrong message to EVERYONE. 
I don't expect Lucic to improve in fact I'll bet he's only gonna get worse. Sitting him would at least send the message....
3453 2018-11-06 18:06:44 Looks great!
3454 2018-11-06 18:06:17 I am now praying that YOU, an old bitter woman who once was America's darling, gets the help you need.  I was a fan dating back to the Sonny and Cher show.  I don't know where you went off the tracks. Like other self absorbed celebrities, nobody cares what you think or spew.
3455 2018-11-06 18:06:16 if u live in florida: when voting, think of the vapers, the most oppressed people. yes i would love to ban offshore oil drilling, but at what cost??
3456 2018-11-06 18:06:16 i’m getting my oil changed and voting. enough adulting for me today.
3457 2018-11-06 18:06:15 This mornings breakfast, love crunch cereal with a banana, wheat grass, chlorella, hemp protein, turmeric, greek - grass fed yoghurt, pea milk, plus a shot of apple cider vinegar, two milk thistle tabs, salmon oil and vitamin b12.
3458 2018-11-06 18:06:12 .
I just voted SO HARD that the pen rammed through the paper, broke the table, smashed through the floor, pierced the ground and I struck oil.  
Now there’s oil on my ballot.  
Does it still count??

3459 2018-11-06 18:06:04 6/6 Nigeria Machine Tools,DELTA STEEL,OSTM,National OIL,DUNLOP TYRES,Nitex,Nascon,Dicon, MICHELIN TYRES,ASABA TEXTILE, KADUNA TEXTILE,Nichemtex &NIC were all alive. Millions of Nigerians were working in those firms &contributing to the GDP. Poverty level was far lower. @CACCOT1
3460 2018-11-06 18:05:58 R Elazar- Torah is concerned for wealth of Israel, hence doesn’t require the most expensive olive oil for menachot.
3461 2018-11-06 18:05:53 lemme get some oil paper for you
3462 2018-11-06 18:05:49 R Yehuda- Mohr oil is extra special because it removes body hair and makes skin shiny.
3463 2018-11-06 18:05:45 Barbara you are 110% correct and this is coming from the Oil industry side of things. I have asked countless time where the jobs are and what sector. You mention Calgary in your tweet and you might as well say Canada. Things are so great CMHC changes regulations, I wonder why?
3464 2018-11-06 18:05:41 My headache cure:
2000mg fish oil (capsules are fine)
half spoonful of turmeric
strong cup of coffee (twice the normal amount in less water)

This works for me every single time, my head pleasantly tingles as the headache fades away, like magic.
3465 2018-11-06 18:05:37 The best olive oil is used for the Menorah; the next best can be used for Menachot.
3466 2018-11-06 18:05:34 انا ما بستعمل البودرة الا نادراً و مرة حكالي الصيدلي انه كل ما كانت oil free كل ما كانت احسن، اما بالنسبة للفاونديشن كل ما كان الكاڤريج تبعته عالية و بتقعد ساعات كتير و بتخبي الحبوب و اثارها كل ما كان عاطل زي الديرماكول
3467 2018-11-06 18:05:28 MN86: What is Mohr oil used in Megilat Esther; How to harvest the best olive oil; Only best oil permitted for use in Temple; Placement of Menorah; Cooked wine can’t be used in temple
3468 2018-11-06 18:05:11 R Yochanan- those who regularly use olive oil are known to be wise.
3469 2018-11-06 18:05:07 Yeah just keep walking if that don’t work then drink the oil lol
3470 2018-11-06 18:05:06 But alas this is the oil field and people come here for work. That is really all they care about. They are just trying to have a better life... that’s why I was hauling oil... but to me voting for Heidi trumps everything.
3471 2018-11-06 18:05:03 When Adwoa is frying plantain she stands near the cooker and puts the plantain into the hot oil but when i am doing it

3472 2018-11-06 18:05:03 This is exactly right.  Pull up a chart of oil and you can see that both global growth and inflation is slowing.  The Fed looks at backwards data to make decisions which will lead to a policy mistake.
3473 2018-11-06 18:04:50 ooo looks amazing!  what oil and recipe did you use its such a deep cake. thank you

3477 2018-11-06 18:04:19 oil bear mrkt + peak US growth narrative + Gridlock 
that 30y looks WAY above what it should be $ZB
3478 2018-11-06 18:04:18 Thank god oil is up eh?

3481 2018-11-06 18:04:11 MN85: Where are bikurim grown; Optimal field for growing the Omer; Wheat that became infested; Best place in Israel to produce oil
3482 2018-11-06 18:04:09 People waving Confederate and Nazi flags don't care about the United States or its people. Those trying to cut Medicare and Social Security, those who deregulate anything including oil drilling to coal mining; you don't seem to give them a fraction of the shit you give me though.
3483 2018-11-06 18:03:57 Tester is the one to watch as an environmental bellwether. Not treehugger vs industry, but tourism vs short term oil field employment. Despite what we hear people in the wild west are saying the reality is,  no one, D or R are happy about ruining the tourism base.
3484 2018-11-06 18:03:54 My friend tried to take in her Benz for an oil change. They told her we don’t do just oil changes, you have to do the whole service. And she was mad that it cost $600 lmfao
3485 2018-11-06 18:03:41 Someone should pour used motor oil all over it 

Then shoot the pussy who killed these poor animals

3492 2018-11-06 18:03:08 Does any one know about musical instruments. Olivia's telling us that her music teacher is telling her to pour water into he valves of her musical instrument to keep them working. Is this correct? As my husband is of the opinion that you need valve oil to keep the valves moving.
3493 2018-11-06 18:02:54 If only we had a most cost effective method of moving our oil; like say a pipeline.
3494 2018-11-06 18:02:53 My favorite time of the year I can put on body oil as lotion without worrying about the sun baking me lol
3495 2018-11-06 18:02:51 I prayed over our polling station and anointed the entrance and exit in oil... may Gods will be done

3500 2018-11-06 18:02:35 She wore high heels and a white top to the market. Cooked stew and 3 abi 4 soups and even 1 small palm oil didn’t stain her white, let’s start there. 
3501 2018-11-06 18:02:31 To be fair, what would you like Lucic to do? While he was clearly dogging it the back half of last season, I don't believe that to be the case this year. He just isn't good enough and that $6M tag around his neck makes it difficult to deal with.

3506 2018-11-06 18:02:03 Oh shit. Im goose
3507 2018-11-06 18:01:50 BECAUSE this government is thick and hasn't got a clue plus they are in the pockets of oil rich companies and countries like Saudi Arabia and America.

3514 2018-11-06 18:00:59 We should have gotten off of the oil kick long time ago. It seems more addictive than sugar.
3515 2018-11-06 18:00:53 Glow is from the sweat and oil, v proud of it
3516 2018-11-06 18:00:44 ahh crap I'm trying to remember. there's a ratio on the back for water and oil, but it's pretty simple to put together. I googletranslated just to get the measurements but I just winged everything else and it was fine!
3517 2018-11-06 18:00:42 CRUDE OIL is falling further (as expected), WTI is now at 61.60 USD and moving. GOLD was also under pressure, moved below 1,230 USD per Tr.oz.

3521 2018-11-06 18:00:32 You: Politics are the lifeblood of this country and every single vote is important. 

Me, an intellectual: Floridians have a single referendum to vote against both offshore oil drilling AND indoor vaping.
3522 2018-11-06 18:00:30 These calls will rise 500% if oil snaps back to $65 into Friday.
3523 2018-11-06 18:00:18 One of our sons even did a pleading in crayons (proudly hanging on the wall.) he’s now an oil and gas litigator in San Antonio. Lol

3530 2018-11-06 17:59:32 Sorry Lenny, but the oil tanker comparison's not good.  Try 1000', not 100'.   And, it might even be easier during a thunder storm depending on the direction of the wind.
3531 2018-11-06 17:59:32 Ehm... It was Di Maio that said that our oil is tourism...
3532 2018-11-06 17:59:25 おぅエロいエロい。まさか自分がお願いされる側になるとは思わなかったよ＞＜
3533 2018-11-06 17:59:15 Difícil si el oil no pega la vuelta... Debajo de los 28.4 hay que rajar furioso. Ahora está cerca del PP.
3534 2018-11-06 17:58:59 Eucalyptus oil! I get mine at Whole Foods
3535 2018-11-06 17:58:59 Then this organization should stop with the "accountability" bs. It doesn't exist in Edm and never will in my life time. Which judging from the males in my family line is at least 40 more years long.
3536 2018-11-06 17:58:32 u have done right job at the right time for approving the minimum wage to be 30,000.buhari till 2023...
3537 2018-11-06 17:58:31 I had to vote yes on an amendment to outlaw dog fighting in Florida today. In 2018! Isn't that sick!!? and to stop oil drilling in the gulf!!! Scary shit!!!
3538 2018-11-06 17:58:27 And thats ok. I wouldnt be able to see over the steering. Lol
3539 2018-11-06 17:58:24 What are some good oils for skin that will last all day (dont say coconut oil cause its garbo)

3541 2018-11-06 17:58:10 Is it diamond made
3542 2018-11-06 17:58:02 So mullah will finish in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, don't worry all gulf nation will finish after 2050-60 when oil will finish
3543 2018-11-06 17:57:39 Hopefully after today the energy will clear and this headache I have had for the last 3 days will clear. No amount of Tylenol or peppermint oil helps. #vote
3544 2018-11-06 17:57:33 In the last eight months, I've worked mostly offshore. Not on an oil platform or anything like that of course. But, that's all I'm going to say. Thankfully, everyone I work with are very like-minded.
3545 2018-11-06 17:57:33 Not sure which is worse, the amount of phone calls I'm getting from volunteers for politicians or the check engine light in my new truck that just turned on. Let's hope it just means an oil change.
3546 2018-11-06 17:57:22 Guardiola is at City for the following...what they're paying him, and what they spend on their squad with oil money, the same as world class players! This is Man City, a shit little 3rd division club who most of their "fans" don't know what colours they play in!
3547 2018-11-06 17:57:20 Any insight on oil/TSys relationship not mean reverting at all?
3548 2018-11-06 17:57:08 Harvard scientists think that an alien ship could have passed near earth last year.
They also think coconut oil is a pure poison.

3550 2018-11-06 17:56:54 City's owners deal in oil not poxy phones. I do own a phone probably made in terrible conditions though and it has autocorrect write. Oh and my work uniform fuck me dont get me started i think thats made in a cave somewhere the shoddy workmanship is obvious.
3551 2018-11-06 17:56:47 Getting some nice long OIL signals. The low is near... Come see why @GuruHavenHQ
3552 2018-11-06 17:56:40 Lmao
3553 2018-11-06 17:56:31 I'm so addicted to Tea Tree oil , I can't take a bath without it, I'd rather shower 
3554 2018-11-06 17:56:23 Ga ada yang mau nyiptain skin care 5 in 1 gitu? Cleansing oil, face wash, toner, essence, moisturizer digabung semua jadi sekali lap kelar.
3555 2018-11-06 17:56:19 not solely. Think about the change in U.S. sanctions on Iran. 30-45 days ago oil was going to $90-$100 because Iran supply was headed to 500k bpd. Now, 8 waivers later, it's 1-1.5 mbpd and Brent is 4-cast $72 for 2019. Also domestic subsidies in EM's distort energy prices
3556 2018-11-06 17:56:18 My salt game is stronger than your oil game oooo
3557 2018-11-06 17:56:17 does tae bathe his hair in castor oil or what his hair is suddenly 10cm longer every time i see him
3558 2018-11-06 17:56:12 I do not have the best intentions when it comes to those pilots. Id be heart broken if they werent all top gun and shit. RAWR
3559 2018-11-06 17:56:09 Exactly.
Also Trump is nothing but a puppet in modi’s hand or else he would never have allowed India to buy Iran oil despite US sanctions.

3562 2018-11-06 17:55:55 Also there’s this coconut oil + red curry chip I had recently that was v v good
3563 2018-11-06 17:55:55 Falling asleep in the car dealership this oil change need to hurry up . I was here a whole 30 minutes early
3564 2018-11-06 17:55:54 Let them come. We will make them drink coconut oil. thanks to Karin Michels we know what coconut oil really is. 

Who are funding these people?
3565 2018-11-06 17:55:52 Seems to me that oil stocks showing positive divergence bc they’re not down as much as oil... you looking to buy soon?
3566 2018-11-06 17:55:34 Me too. Save for the I’m blind as a bat plus a whole bunch of other things. But, this is Twitter, so why not?  Howdy squadron mate Nicole

3569 2018-11-06 17:55:27 Where can I buy the exact same chilli oil from paesano
3570 2018-11-06 17:55:26 It's good propaganda. WW1 Tommies died for oil, power, influence and land grab, not for our freedom as successive governments and others like to sell it. People don't like to hear that but rudimentary research confirms it as a fact. Service personnel used and abused? You bet.
3571 2018-11-06 17:55:18 Tried oil ?
3572 2018-11-06 17:55:16 Plus when Oil #firechiarelli the new gm will want their own guy.
3573 2018-11-06 17:55:06 Tip: When you're next at the supermarket get some coconut flour, coconut oil and Almond flour - these are great to have in your cupboard to make Keto friendly breads and cakes!
3574 2018-11-06 17:55:01 i got oil pastels all over my jacket and i'm annoyed
3575 2018-11-06 17:54:58 Willing to bet oil price collapse since beginning of October has slowed down debt payments. And good day to you !
3576 2018-11-06 17:54:53 o i wonder if i liked that lemondrop sesame combo cos it's similar to vinegar and sesame oil. dumplin sauce.
3577 2018-11-06 17:54:46 Its not about the people that will lose their jobs its the money that the communities will lose. The money that pours into schools. I know oil companies have bought iPads and other things for schools and that will all go away. So lets have more regulations and less books for kids
3578 2018-11-06 17:54:45 There will be when we rename it by deed poll with dirty Arab human rights oil money
3579 2018-11-06 17:54:30 This mom put “focus” oil on the back of her kids necks when she should’ve put her fucking hand on em instead
3580 2018-11-06 17:54:28 When a recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, so you buy a whole bottle, and now you are committed to find more recipes that need it.
3581 2018-11-06 17:54:21 North Korea??? I'm talking about the past 20 years. The wars that we started for oil under the guise of terrorism.
3582 2018-11-06 17:54:01 I dont like cleaning the oven anymore than anyone else and I don't like my eyes burning from oil smoke, whilst frantically wafting a tea towel at the smoke alarm..
3583 2018-11-06 17:54:00 Pls,  groundnut oil over everything,  even  Eru 
3584 2018-11-06 17:53:47 ppl who know things bout CARS:

I can't remember if my mechanic switched my engine oil from 5w30 to 5w0-which he had mentioned possibly doing at last oil change. I'm low on oil. Would it hurt if I add in 5w30 either way?
3585 2018-11-06 17:53:45 Oil in my pen burning down low-key
3586 2018-11-06 17:53:37 My brother made oil catch fire in his kitchen because he wanted to fry something in a pot,,,,,

3590 2018-11-06 17:53:12 1/6. Do you know $1 exchanged for N72 when PDP took over power from the military in 1999. By divine operation, the price of crude oil shot through the roofs and our oil was in great demand all over the world. We made loads and loads of dollars. @CACCOT1

3594 2018-11-06 17:52:46 Even govt of countries that we don't belong to gives us over 400,000 naira equivalent monthly. And they don't have oil.
3595 2018-11-06 17:52:43 So the better “leadership” was a Snake Oil Salesman with “Hope and Change” as his “elect me” message.......that turned to “I HOPE the folks aren’t aware of what CHANGE I have in store for them...even though I told them otherwise”

3620 2018-11-06 17:50:57 Heaven help us if Dems get the governor office. Oil/gas revenues will be like an open check book and start spending like drunken sailors.
3621 2018-11-06 17:50:48 So going lower oil is actually bullish? #confused
3622 2018-11-06 17:50:36 I bought some fake imported olive oil that makes my whole body hurt when I eat it.

Just found out some are made with motor oil!!!

3624 2018-11-06 17:50:32 Biggest component of consumer inflation is oil price. Also heat for Canadian. If you raise then , it raise everything, from the bakery bills to home bills. Apparently rasing costs to consumer will impact positively the environment.  Is environment another name to gov here?

3629 2018-11-06 17:49:57 Canada doesn't buy oil. All refineries are privately owned. Thet decide what oil to buy to refine. US fractured oil is cheap, Saudi oil is cheap, Alberta oil is expensive to refine. This isn't rocket science. Refiners are going to buy what makes them the most profits.
3630 2018-11-06 17:49:56 my flatmate put oil in her pasta “so it wouldn’t stick to the pan” i’m ???
3631 2018-11-06 17:49:40 Nowt wrong with that. It's a good idea to put your tin on a tray, covered with foil, which catches the oil that's displaced as the Yorkshire pudding cooks. Stops it burning on the bottom of the oven. (And wrapping the tray in foil, stops it burning onto the tray)
3632 2018-11-06 17:49:40 Nice job Jacob! I wonder how big of an impact it had with the BP Oil Spill?
3633 2018-11-06 17:49:39 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the publisher of the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

3663 2018-11-06 17:46:43 I even told my friends a year ago that Tesla might got bankrupt. Because all these opec nations will go bankrupt if tesla succeed. My guess is big oil companies deliberately sabotaged the tesla growth.

3666 2018-11-06 17:46:32 I don't think so. Not sure it's really needed when the shelf life is likely to be so short. If writers at The Athletic want access there should be plenty of Boys on the Bus to tap into. It isn't the style of Willis, Lowetide, et al either.

3669 2018-11-06 17:46:15 That’s basically it. The oil should be hot enough that stuff won’t just sit in it and get oily, but not so hot that it burns before it’s cooked. The magic range is 180-190°C, and I always use a cooking thermometer, cause I lack that laissez faire confidence, but basically if…

3678 2018-11-06 17:44:10 By the way, it's not "their tribe." Native Americans have different tribes and backgrounds. They're not all in a "tribe." As for fracking, well I'm sure you liberals would prefer to continue letting the Middle-East use oil as leverage and keep screwing America on oil prices.

3688 2018-11-06 17:43:34 I don't disagree but if I'm not mistaken, no one from the Athletic had access during 2017-18 did they?
3689 2018-11-06 17:43:23 That's what I think too. What scares me is that Lowe's little bit only comes up during big decisions.
3690 2018-11-06 17:43:16 You confuse personal and corporate taxes . I am suggesting a levy on exported oil from pipeline.  We don't get value for the taxes we pay.
3691 2018-11-06 17:43:12 PDP folks do ask for the achievements of this admin. My answer is "we don't have a talking President, he is a doer".

3698 2018-11-06 17:42:32 Also China will need oil a little longer than US because solar revolution is slower, but more permanent than fracking revolution. By 2020s US only needs Gulf for arms sales & maybe agriculture exports.

They charged me $90 for an oil change (it’d be proper) and took over 2hours with no call (they were going to call me when ready but didn’t). Since then, they keep calling me about buying my car although I told them I won’t. 
3719 2018-11-06 17:40:34 Many, many more people in the state and country have high anxiety about the climate crisis and the poisons being pushed into ground water from fracking. How about the oil and gas industry employees retrain and cash in on the renewables boom?
3720 2018-11-06 17:40:25 Brought my car in for an oil change w a coupon for 29.99. Ended up needing 850$ in repairs bc my car is from 2004 
3721 2018-11-06 17:40:18 But he's playing so much better this year and does such a great job of keeping all the talented guys healthy and in one piece ;)

3725 2018-11-06 17:40:09 he obviously doesnt understand the market. It was a really bad piece
3726 2018-11-06 17:40:02 Oil,money and more oil
3727 2018-11-06 17:39:57 Love throwing on a nice oil and getting compliments facts 
3728 2018-11-06 17:39:54 The whole premise of The Athletic is that they won't be churning out lazy access pieces or game recaps. In Edmonton, you should add 80's Oilers pieces to that list.

3736 2018-11-06 17:39:30 I just want to see is an article that tells me what MacT, Lowe, etc. actually do at this point.
3737 2018-11-06 17:39:25 Home from holibobs a few days early to beat the bad weather forecast....plumber hasn’t finished installing new oil tank....no hot water or heating 
3738 2018-11-06 17:39:23 Would that suit US as high oil price hurts American economy ?
3739 2018-11-06 17:39:11 And to be honest how on earth can any manufacturer think shortbread should have palm oil in it is beyond me - flour, sugar and butter is all that is needed for proper shortbread.
3740 2018-11-06 17:39:02 "(this is a metaphor)" this PC bullshit needs to stop. if you're not ready to get a real scalp like a real big boy then you deserve Castor oil as a cure-for-all instead of Medicare (for all)
3741 2018-11-06 17:39:01 Can’t even take a nap because I gotta go get my oil changed.
3742 2018-11-06 17:38:54 I have to get synthetic oil.
3743 2018-11-06 17:38:53 I’m old enough to remember when Republicans balked at the Obama administration not wanting to bring oil from Canada, and Canada saying; “That’s ok, we’ll just sell to China”.

3751 2018-11-06 17:37:43 im going to get my oil change
3752 2018-11-06 17:37:41 The background is that information moves slowly to others, just like an oil spill slowly moves, to reach a wider audience. Except ofcourse an oill spill is by definition destructive and info can be as well but info can also be positive.
3753 2018-11-06 17:37:39 It should

3757 2018-11-06 17:37:09 I’ve had two phone calls and then had to make one... bless the Lord I’m up now world. And I just put one too many drops of lemon essential oil in my defuser sooo my room will probably smell like a lemon tree when I get back to it. 
3758 2018-11-06 17:37:06 he misread that he could write something like that and not get torn apart
3759 2018-11-06 17:37:00 I see the Unite union is now trying to get the Edinburgh tram drivers out on strike. Also read over the weekend of attempts by some union(s) to get the oil industry workers out on strike too. 
3760 2018-11-06 17:36:37 Vote for @tedcruz @SenTedCruz ... @BetoORourke wants to RAISE Oil Taxes by $10/barrel.

3766 2018-11-06 17:36:04 Can’t believe there’s people who drive without ever checking their tyre pressure or oil level
3767 2018-11-06 17:36:02 I'ma have a push party and slip all of yall a lil castor oil LOL

Just playing. I heard thats terrible. Let em bake as long as possible.
3768 2018-11-06 17:36:01 Not in itself (though Irving was a partner for Energy East), but why aren't carbon levy's placed on imported oil. At the very least they should be charged against the transport of oil from ME though we should be charging on production as well.
3769 2018-11-06 17:35:59 Houston is the largest city in Texas and the fourth most populous city in the United States. The city is known as a world capital of the Oil & Gas industry, with over 5,000 energy firms doing business in the region.

3770 2018-11-06 17:35:55 Fielding emphasizes what has happened is NOT a collapse of our commercial sector. This is a very narrow issue, caused by decline in value of small # of high-value, oil and gas towers. Class B office space the biggest challenge.
3771 2018-11-06 17:35:45 Don’t they provide most of Europe with oil?
3772 2018-11-06 17:35:16 I need some more Liberal tears gun oil. Running low right now. Take your meds Jenny. 
3773 2018-11-06 17:35:16 Record amounts are being dumped in Quebec waterways with blessing of the Fed Govt. Canada also disproportionately controls amounts of forests & fresh water. NB Power’s coal generator is exempt. Oil Cos still receiving corporate welfare.  BS Environmental policy for elites.

3784 2018-11-06 17:34:39 Not sure it's a matter of misreading the pulse but rather not wanting to step on any toes. I can tell you from experience, trying to gain access to Oilers is next to impossible compared to must other NHL teams. Though I agree, the access is useless if you do nothing w/ it.
3785 2018-11-06 17:34:36 Tullow Oil expects the first crude shipments from its Kenyan oilfields in the first half of 2019, pricing the product for the market.

3787 2018-11-06 17:34:34 Been waiting in the oil change line longer than the polls.
3788 2018-11-06 17:34:25 IRAN SANCTIONS

Sanctions create a black market, 50-70% cheaper than the official market, as in the run up to 2014 oil price collapse.

Why would you think that buyers would avoid buying in the black market with fake bills of lading?

The black market becomes the price setter.
3789 2018-11-06 17:34:23 @KerriMPR I love making minestrone. Any vegetables you have on hand, can even sneak some kale in there. Topped with a drizzle of olive oil and a bunch of Parmesan, add crusty warm bread for dipping. Yum!

3802 2018-11-06 17:33:15 and reversed Obama’s ban on new federal coal leases. Trump also expedited the construction of the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline that had been delayed by Obama and approved the Keystone XL Pipeline that Obama had vetoed.
3803 2018-11-06 17:33:09 Essentially, Trump is unraveling former President Barack Obama’s entire environmental legacy, while extending the oil and gas industries’ lifelines. He ended Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which planned to slash pollution by over 30 percent by 2013

3833 2018-11-06 17:30:13 but it's going to get dirty very fast if I use it daily. The white one is canvas, but the ivory one is leather - squeaky clean with just a little oil wipe.

3847 2018-11-06 17:29:06 Well it did when you consider they said they overspent last year by $89M but they failed to include the $200M or so in additional revenue from oil that is not accounted for. #nlpoli

3854 2018-11-06 17:27:41 Why does Oil of Olay burn my eyes...
3855 2018-11-06 17:27:34 Everything is depended from whether KSA, Russia and Trump (through Iran) want to see higher oil prices or not. If they leave things as is, we could go lower than high 50's again. If not, $70's likely again. But market won't bid this up again to $85+ unless some shocks. #OOTT
3856 2018-11-06 17:27:30 The oil companies have nothing to do with the amount of tax we pay on the gas.  The tax is paid at the pump and most stations are against the tax.  This is 100% incorrect.
3857 2018-11-06 17:27:28 You know what I love the most about my business is being able to talk with people that don't know about CBD Oil and it's benefits! I'm so glad so many more people are becoming more accepting of this Amazing all Natural Product! If I can help you with anything please let me know!

3871 2018-11-06 17:26:08 They are getting paid in kind in many cases with oil which it has been doing for many years and is just expanding the list of those who they do that with. Bondholders can’t transact oil barrels as easily.
3872 2018-11-06 17:26:02 The supply of oil and coal will last longer than any of us. And at the point of scarcity it's cost of recovery will cause it to be surpassed by other sources, such as nuclear and perhaps a far more advanced form of solar.
3873 2018-11-06 17:26:02 Tried lots of permutations and combinations like empty coconut shell, thermos flask , toy cars, empty edible oil cans etc
3874 2018-11-06 17:26:00 I agree we need all forms of energy but this bill would potentially shut down 90% of all Colorado oil and gas development and that would be terrible for the people of Colorado. Hope you have a good day Heidi.

3880 2018-11-06 17:25:21 My cheapest solution to my chronic migraines was CBD oil. A one-month supply is about $75. I still get 1-2 a month (about 3-4 days since they usually last more than 24 hours) but it's an enormous improvement. Can't reccommend highly enough.

3882 2018-11-06 17:25:06 Good choice homie. Fracking is the breakup and mining of deep ocean floors for oil, which has caused some of the most extreme climate disasters in modern history. Vote against fracking always.

Republicans couldn't possibly care less -- oil companies are among their biggest donors. Still need a reason to vote today?
3890 2018-11-06 17:24:25 Because we're not more terrified of poor people 1000 miles away than the Saudi oil wars that are creating refugees, and terrorists, while turning our country into a 3rd world dictatorship.

3913 2018-11-06 17:21:35 I like Body Shop's vitamin E face cleanser and aloe day cream. Jojoba oil is usually good/safe as a face oil. I've also used Pearlessence rosehip + vitamin C oil. I avoid anything with tea tree oil because too harsh & developed allergy.

3928 2018-11-06 17:19:45 There is also the aspect of rumination over the matter which is part and parcel of procrastination. You think about the things you try to avoid doing and in a way you can hone down much of the trivialities along the way. Tempering the blade before finally dousing it in the oil.

3933 2018-11-06 17:19:24 I presume you're referring to WWII? The USA HELPED to save France after ignoring Europe for the first two years of the war and only reluctantly joining after Pearl Harbour.

3944 2018-11-06 17:18:18 Lol. Heat the oil! Or oven, if you are watching your cholesterol!
3945 2018-11-06 17:18:18 Let me make one thing clear to you. It’s the anti -oil activists along with the Liberal government that keep “ moving the goal posts “
Huge low population density countries use more energy and resources to move people, goods and services. Hard things are hard
3946 2018-11-06 17:18:11 EIA thinks the oil market will be balanced in 2018 (surplus of +0.02mbpd, previously in deficit of -0.20mbpd) and be oversupplied by 0.64mbpd (was 0.28mbpd) in 2019.

3948 2018-11-06 17:18:04 Oil and natural gas has always been a topic I’ve felt lots of people voice their opinion on but most people don’t take time to research it in depth. I think it was definitely on everyone’s mind this past month, however.

3971 2018-11-06 17:15:24 But you and I know what @ogundamisi said was an obvious truth.
3972 2018-11-06 17:15:11 EIA estimates that U.S. crude oil production averaged 11.4 million barrels per day (b/d) in October, down slightly from September levels because of hurricane-related outages in the Gulf of Mexico #OOTT

3978 2018-11-06 17:15:01 You gently wash around them and your lids. Use oil free cleanser. I used my fingers, but you can use a q tip. 

I didn’t need mascara with mine so it was easy.
3979 2018-11-06 17:14:59 A tariff on imported foreign oil would quickly incent the Irving’s to “buy Canadian” instead of Saudi oil.  Feds already decided it’s in Canada’s best interests to do this for the dairy industry, but sadly western Canada is at the bottom of their priority list.
3980 2018-11-06 17:14:53 with that specific proposition I don’t think people researched. the oil company jumped the gun and started handing out signs and saying all this stuff way in advance and people never questioned it. at least this is what happened for the few people i know that were against it
3981 2018-11-06 17:14:52 Wonder if @terranovajoe @HalftimeReport got outa his oil names before today? Hope so Joe!
3982 2018-11-06 17:14:49 EIA expects Brent spot prices will average $72 in 2019 and that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices will average about $7/b lower than Brent prices next year. #OOTT

3986 2018-11-06 17:14:11 AN OIL TANKER FOR YOU
3987 2018-11-06 17:14:00 I've been sitting tight since my buying binge. Up about 2% across the board. I bought some $BP and $RDS.A to get back in some oil. May be a little early yet, but looking to add more oil on further weakness. Should be better after the big erection and heading into Black Friday.
3988 2018-11-06 17:13:28 Feel better. Ginger ale is good for stomach flu as well as sniffing peppermint oil. Peppermint helps a lot of taking away nausea. And go on the BRAT diet for the next 24 hours. BRAT diet is Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast. Hope that helps you out. Hang in there.
3989 2018-11-06 17:13:21 @mark_dow did a good job explaining this and you can see that their stock returns have largely divorced themselves from oil’s underlying price. Motto now seems to be generate as much cash as you can for as long as you.

3991 2018-11-06 17:13:19 If the revenues derived from producing fracked oil/gas in the Uk pays for the NHS etc. no Gov will ban fracking. Whatever the fine words.

4009 2018-11-06 17:11:39 To be fair oil is much more of a manipulated market right now with the Trump head fake on waivers...this isn’t just a demand read-thru (although that’s a part of it)

4032 2018-11-06 17:08:53 It's not because the federal & many provincial governments, and the entire oil industry are working overtime to get their pipelines, is it?  I mean, that's not news. What is news is that a senior oil executive is willing to stand up and say what he thinks about climate change.
4033 2018-11-06 17:08:51 I am 8,460 words into @NaNoWriMo just shy of the 10k goal, but I am burning that midnight oil and really happy with my story!

The oil company can take a hit. This will allow for other renewable energy companies to step in and hire people. Morals are more important than money.

4036 2018-11-06 17:08:43 Agreed but nothing goes down in a straight line and oil extremely oversold in the ST, hence I foresee at least an imminent ST bounce.
4037 2018-11-06 17:08:37 Jarrod, your ministry to us today was outstanding. God speaks powerfully when we hear the voice of the prophet! Thanks for challenging us with such openness and honesty. Without doubt the oil was in the room!
4038 2018-11-06 17:08:35 I use beard oil in mine. It bassically just traps the moisture in your beard after a shower and keeps it feeling soft. I also have beard wax but I really haven't used it yet. I don't think my beard is long enough to warrant wax. But the oil works great!
4039 2018-11-06 17:08:22 Not broccoli rabe w/collards. Try olive oil (not much), smoked turkey leg-cut up, garlic - sliced/chopped & saute'. Add shredded collards & some dried cranberries 4 sweetness. Season w/salt, pepper + little h20 2 steam. done

4052 2018-11-06 17:06:32 Good, get out of here. Oil is short sighted - it’s short term gain with incredible long term consequences. Let’s rather attract and bring in clean, renewable and suistainable energy. It may be harder and cost more, but let’s look at the big picture For the sake of our future.
4053 2018-11-06 17:06:31 It seems it started with the parents maintaining Joe's Italian citizenship.
4054 2018-11-06 17:06:24 I'll be impressed when they reduce spending rather then just ride a beneficial price of oil. Same as every other Government. Have a plan for if it goes the other way.

Our oil industry creates wealth, not "temporary" jobs. Canadians can reduce our personal carbon footprints while still supplying the oil that is critical to the advancement of developing countries.

4135 2018-11-06 17:00:24 Thanks Mr. President. When there was oil boom they left it at 18k now with dwindling economy you still went ahead to do the people's bidding. I'm more than convince you meant well for this country. Surely you will take us there.
4136 2018-11-06 17:00:18 GW1 had very little honour. It wasn't a war. Asymmetric war against poorly armed cannon fodder. A ritual slaughter for oil plunder.

-Oil Pipelines
-Housing the homeless
-Demilitarizing police
-Free public college
-Abolishing private prisons
Funny those things aren't ever on a ballot...

4198 2018-11-06 16:55:03 Rosehip oil ni kita panggil "dry oil", digalakkan apply sebelum moisturizer :)

Tapi nak pakai selepas moisturizer atau campurkan sedikit dengan moisturizer pun boleh. Tak jadi masalah. Ikut keselesaan & boleh experiment sendiri cara mana yang berkesan untuk kulit you.
4199 2018-11-06 16:55:00 If you don't support O&G, stop driving, heating your home, using makeup, cell phones, refrigerators, and literally anything made from plastic. You use oil everyday, and unless you want to live in a mud hut living off the land vote NO on Prop 112.

Avocado and coconut oil both work to hydrate and nourish your skin, protecting it from premature aging and leaving you with soft, supple skin. Avocado also protects against free radicals, slowing down the aging process of the skin.

4231 2018-11-06 16:51:30 2- Lemon, Yoghurt and Coconut oil Facemask

4234 2018-11-06 16:51:25 Foodie friends - I've been baking salmon fillets using a simple recipe (s&p, lemon slices, olive oil, high heat) 2x a month for a few years now. It's .... good but I'm looking for something different. Anything good come to mind? Preferably without bread or soy or added sugar.
4235 2018-11-06 16:51:25 IIRC it came in 2 colors, one was wax, one was oil.  I forget which.  I think the red might be oil because they usually oiled the asbestos flooring we had instead of waxing.
4236 2018-11-06 16:51:21 We thank God. But what happens when our sole 'saviour', 
crude oil sells at a low price?  We print money again?
4237 2018-11-06 16:51:13 A full cost comparison must include gas/energy, oil/fluid changes, depreciation (at minimum should be based on values with mileage increasing and condition fixed), and wear to tires, belts, brakes, etc. These are directly attributable to miles driven and add up fast.
4238 2018-11-06 16:51:11 One simple thing no decision makers specially myloard are  not ready to understand that Diwali is 1 day , and after that also there is 364 days in yrs ...... 
how about that ? 364 days ..... all are sleeping putting oil in their ears.
4239 2018-11-06 16:51:11 I'm an omnivore, cutting back on m**t and f**h.  I love "salade tiede", ie salad with a great dressing and something warm mixed in. To replace the bad stuff, you could add chunks of potato sauteed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary.  Ditto other root veg.
4240 2018-11-06 16:50:46 Cos it's a punishable offence that could land you in jail
4241 2018-11-06 16:50:46 Kinda like when you take your car into the shop to get a simple oil change, and then a week later your muffler system falls off, so yes! 
4242 2018-11-06 16:50:39 It will trigger inflation soon, the increase will be wiped off because there is no production to back it up other than oil money and government sharing. It is rational to increase pay when there is production forecast to back it up.
4243 2018-11-06 16:50:28 Olive oil on the forehead to this day.
4244 2018-11-06 16:50:23 @tesco_inverness today, diesel = £1.349 per litre. or a shocking £6.12 per gallon. Thanks, Brexit :(. Thanks, Tory Government. Just a pity we didn't live in a country that produced oil. Oops... wait a minute. Oh @YesHighland @theSNP
4245 2018-11-06 16:50:22 It's a cart where they have bulk olives in oil. Different varieties, some are stuffed with cheeses and things. You fill a carton and pay by weight. The smell kills me 
4246 2018-11-06 16:50:09 We graduated over 3 years ago and you've not changed it since that time
4247 2018-11-06 16:50:04 Translation......we got lucky on oil.
4248 2018-11-06 16:50:04 like rn, I need an oil change and it’s bothering me that I haven’t gotten it yet 
4249 2018-11-06 16:50:01 Yes...Oil is looking very bearish at the moment...Eventually it will trade up but hard to say from what level.
4250 2018-11-06 16:49:57 We remain the only country in the history of the world to have discovered massive oil reserves and gotten poorer. But people still fall for this “too poor” guff.

4260 2018-11-06 16:49:11 @Enterprise I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone I filled the tank up and it wasn’t on full when I took the car and they didn’t even credit my account. They also gave me a car that had stains all in the seats and wasn’t washed and kept saying it needed an oil change for eight days

4264 2018-11-06 16:48:29 Take care when cooking with hot oil and think about using thermostatically controlled deep fat fryers. Accidents whilst cooking account for 59% of fires in the home.

4283 2018-11-06 16:46:41 I think Musk's goal is/was to have solar powered charging stations all over the place. Just can't produce enough power, though. I do think that marrying solar with coal/oil can provide some real benefits.
4284 2018-11-06 16:46:38 I got one of our hedgehogs back with mites... I'm pissed! Looks like oil baths for everyone tonight on one has it and she is isolated but I'm not risking 14 hogs to have mites!!!

4294 2018-11-06 16:46:08 If data is the new oil, then APIs are the oil pumps of the 21st century.

APIs pump data. And at traditional banks from the depths of their IT landscapes. APIs make the Internet machine-readable and often form the basis of successful e-commerce business models.
4295 2018-11-06 16:46:08 Pep's right, it's also down to Oil
4296 2018-11-06 16:46:07 coconut oil is a life saver
4297 2018-11-06 16:46:05 Also it matters greatly what KIND of a recession it is theoretically. 2008 housing crisis Hit lower income hard, middle income harder. The next recession will most likely be based on resources/trade increasing prices of both Oil and Lithium. Who knows.

4302 2018-11-06 16:45:50 Red Tide Rick backed oil drilling in the everglades. He was invested in the company seeking to drill there. 
Rick Scott has grown his personal wealth by hundreds of millions with his back room deals and kickbacks. He is for himself, not Florida.
4303 2018-11-06 16:45:40 He's a Kasich guy, and unless people haven't paid attention, Kasich is more Democrat than he is Republican. But I'm gonna grit my teeth and vote Dewine. Can't risk a democrat getting Ohio. We became slow enough in the oil industry under Obama.
4304 2018-11-06 16:45:26 How did I go from being down 60% on an oil short to down only 10%? Broke the rule and averaged down a loser multiple times. Being able to wait helped too. If the downside momentum picks up we could crack $60 $WTI

4346 2018-11-06 16:41:43 I am also constructive on oil prices..I shorted puts strike 60 and 61 for this Friday expiry. But we need to admit that short term this is looking very ugly. The price action is just terrible. OPEC needs to really cut back on production otherwise this keeps on going lower.
4347 2018-11-06 16:41:42 The memories of murdering farmers in their country for oil heroin and banks. So touching
4348 2018-11-06 16:41:21 Bioderma's Sebium moisturizer is such a revelation. The oil mine that is my face is neither oily nor dry.

4370 2018-11-06 16:39:39 I will relax when the Midterms are over and Trump goes back to not caring about/desiring higher oil price.

4379 2018-11-06 16:38:54 Voting: its not perfect but as it stands it's the only accessible option to implement any sort of change so ya gotta do it even tho it probably doesnt matter and ice caos are melting and the rainforest is being destroyed and the god damned oil wars folks its all a fuckin mess
4380 2018-11-06 16:38:54 And the resources, like water, will for some time be difficult to extract and therefore relatively scarce. When those resources become essential to the development of a cislunar economy, conflict is likely. Water is the oil of space. Wars have been fought over oil.

4382 2018-11-06 16:38:46 Great ideal: America is now the biggest exporter of oil in the world and best economy. So, best thing is vote Democrat to stop this progress!!
4383 2018-11-06 16:38:41 @tvcnewsng #JH the fact that pump price of pms is fixed at N145 by the FG automatically presupposes that this price will be defended by the govt even when global price of oil fluctuates, therefore, embedded in this model is inherently some level of subsidy, period.

China - 360,000 bpd
4393 2018-11-06 16:37:58 You got it wrong, putting forth in table of comparison between Saudi Arabia, Qatar with Nigeria oil wealth.Saudi produce more than 10million barrel of oil daily with demographic population of less than 30million head while 190million Nigeria produce only 2million. Compounding!

4406 2018-11-06 16:37:13 To anyone who heard this morning's show and thought "I must try that coffee with butter and oil in", I'd just like to point out that I've had to spend all day in bed and currently have an awful migraine. Plus sick. Plus other.
4407 2018-11-06 16:37:07 My braids itch so f*cking bad & i left my coconut oil on my counter this morning

4419 2018-11-06 16:36:20 It doesn’t even have to be a major spill. Oil leaks, methane escapes, and oil companies cover it up. Times up for fossil fuel industry!

4424 2018-11-06 16:35:54 - wash your pillow case every week
- get at least 7-8 hours of sleep 
- only drink water and green tea
- don't exfoliate too often, 2-3 times a week is enough 
- don't pop your pimples, use a spot treatment or tea tree oil
4425 2018-11-06 16:35:41 We have been extracting and condensing cannabis products for 3 years now. The Extreme oil is cannabis oil and other elements from the buds of the plant which are condensed 8:1 by weight. If you want more info contact me at kimpaddock@ymail.com. God bless!

4428 2018-11-06 16:35:21 If it’s dry you’ll need something heavier, something thicker or with more oils like vitamin E + rose oil. And if it’s combination you can do either of the two depending on how dry or oily different parts of you skin get
4429 2018-11-06 16:35:20 yah, u want to allow a party that is currently in power to maintain power after they filled the EPA with oil & chemical lobbyists?

4435 2018-11-06 16:34:30 Engine developers Porsche were also getting way more from the 1721 turbo than Volvo allowed; it was pegged back to 120bhp to preserve status of the 740/760 Turbos. Piston squirters and an oil pump which ran for a minute after the engine was turned off! Massively overbuilt!
4436 2018-11-06 16:34:06 oof. i spent 3/4ish hours trying to get comfortable with oil pastels and how they work. I feel a teeny bit better now about working with 'em but still.
4437 2018-11-06 16:34:02 Harmonic pattern trade setup in progress for #crude oil. $cl_f
4438 2018-11-06 16:33:55 Yields should fall as inflation expectations should fall with PMI data as well. The counter would be total growth and wage inflation grows stronger. However, oil, PMI data and yields do trend together
4439 2018-11-06 16:33:55 Crude oil has 2 lows back in Feb--one at $58.07 and a week later at $58.20 --a couple more bearish supply numbers and we get there --5 weeks in a row supplies built more than forecast --Will this be the 6th? #oott #crudeoil
4440 2018-11-06 16:33:53 It looks good just reduce the oil a bit more next time. Your a true  king
4441 2018-11-06 16:33:50 Salt water and/or tea tree oil
4442 2018-11-06 16:33:44 You mean short the fact ?? This oil is just plunging.....I am so glad I took my losses at 67 handle with what I bought at 69 and have been fairly quiet since.
4443 2018-11-06 16:33:39 It’s cool man, It was my fault I over did with the oil
4444 2018-11-06 16:33:38 can someone tell me why the fuck we’re having to vote on amendments that bundle completely unrelated measures? like oh do you want to prohibit offshore oil and gas drilling AND vaping in an inclosed indoor workplace... i thought i read that shit wrong but nope

4447 2018-11-06 16:33:12 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions.

4491 2018-11-06 16:29:20 Start with your skin type, figure out if it’s dry, oily or combination. A good way to do that is was your face and leave it without moisturizer for about an hour and see if your skin oils up, which parts oil up or which parts feel rough/dry

4502 2018-11-06 16:28:12 You're right that climate change is a huge problem. But to think 112 has any impact on that is probably too optimistic. That oil production lost will just move to another part of the world. Most cost effective alternatives the true way to win that.

Brent down. The rest of OPEC is making up the Iran shortfall but it seems like Iran will carry on supplying. Leads to more oil in market (or via the backdoor) than necessary.
4604 2018-11-06 16:20:47 Sounds about right.

4615 2018-11-06 16:19:46 Indian government owned oil PSUs won't. Private sector has already
4616 2018-11-06 16:19:39 I remember, as a child in my ancestral village in north Bihar, taking an old coconut oil tin filled with rice to village grocery store to exchange for candy (toffee) - barter was quite common in the late 1970’s
4617 2018-11-06 16:19:14 Good. So supply and demand normally means that when the oil industry in the US expands, and the middle east doesn't constrain output, then supply meets or exceeds demand and prices drop. And, of course, clean oil, easier to process, demands a higher price. So go ahead.

4631 2018-11-06 16:18:27 Global oil demand is still rising, so we need to supply more oil. Canada is bowing to the environmentalists, who are paid by foreign oil. Meanwhile it opens the doors for Saudi and Iran etc, with lower environmental standards to gain more market share.
4632 2018-11-06 16:18:26 Thank you very much for the info Jamie. I am a founding member in the Halifax West group, but like you on the fence trying to figure out if we are used by the Liberals to spit the Conservative votes against them. Direct questions on immigration or support of oil are not answered

4670 2018-11-06 16:15:25 "Oh!  Yes, I think so.  Thank you."  He took the cup and set it on the counter and began to very meticulously measure out the oil.  He wanted to get it right.
4671 2018-11-06 16:15:23 yea the oil trade is packed like sardines. Just not entirely sure whether short spoos is good idea yet, narrative on downturn is pretty shrug

4674 2018-11-06 16:15:09 The only thing I can tell you about my car is the make and model and when to get an oil change.  Outside of that I know nothing . It’s sad .

4700 2018-11-06 16:13:22 It smells very close to Oil of Olay or whatever that lotion is called that all moms use, but it's lighter and the smell doesn't linger, your skin drinks it and after that the fragrance drifts away

4706 2018-11-06 16:12:39 Spending still has to go down $500M-$1B a year in NL and oil prices won't always save our asses
4707 2018-11-06 16:12:38 Never for a moment doubt that the war on Canadian Oil & pipelines is being financed by the likes of George Soros & Tom Steyer of Tides Foundation. Gerry Butts is on record as saying ultimate plan is no oil. Note too that Steyer & Soros own coal mines & most NA rail tankers.

4708 2018-11-06 16:12:34 That is one of the worst sources you could of linked, it's a bloody homeopathy, snake oil website. No science at all in it.

4714 2018-11-06 16:11:08 I did this last winter when I got the flue and was coughing so bad I was choking, it was the only thing that would stop the cough.  Inhale some rosemary oil too, it helps.
4715 2018-11-06 16:11:07 Do you work for a windows company? 
You must know about the hazardous chemicals which are released into the environment when making the windows?
Also, oil goes into the making of windows/doors and we are running out of oil.
So the makers are thinking about NOW, not the future.
4716 2018-11-06 16:11:03 Mark my words but if Prop 6 passes, it won’t make gas any cheaper, the oil companies will just keep prices the same and pocket the difference.
4717 2018-11-06 16:10:57 Is it really Nigerian soup if it's not drowning in palm oil?

4722 2018-11-06 16:10:43 @263Chat you need to have the facts correct for a constructive discussion. No oil or gas has been discovered. Exploration results indicate a possibility of oil and/or gas. That needs to be straightened out to avoid misleading people.
4723 2018-11-06 16:10:38 A local repub came in to my place of business the other day, left 5 maga hats on the counter and demanded that we give them to customers
during the day 5 customers came in took a hat, dipped it in waste oil and tossed it in the wood stove no more hats
4724 2018-11-06 16:10:30 You are very right, sometime ago it's was what kept this country going now we feel we discovered oil and so the hell agriculture. I don't even understand why we have all the necessary resources that can help a country's economy but yet we are struggling so much. Poor leadership
4725 2018-11-06 16:10:28 CBD oil has so many health benefits. I wish it didn't cost a gazzillion moneys

4735 2018-11-06 16:09:43 Please don't @ me talking about some ginger, garlic, tumeric oregano oil, avc, I know prolly better than you what cures shit. ion need no advice. God got me sick for a reason. this a supernatural sickness.
4736 2018-11-06 16:09:37 Like Labour in the UK, the SDP vote was effectively a coalfield vote. The two are still remarkably tied. The renewable economy (im not a fan of) and the energy culture that goes with it will support Greens over SDP.  With SNP in Scotland it was oil.
4737 2018-11-06 16:09:31 How's the air doing? How's the water doing? Any chance of oil pipeline leaks?  Our public schools? What's the future of Medicare and Social Security?  The National debt?
4738 2018-11-06 16:09:29 Why's it swimming in oil? Also.. mushrooms you disgusting tramp.

4800 2018-11-06 16:03:47 if these NEW oil rigs are set for construction along the Gulf of Mexico for the production of MORE oil, @AndrewGillum We have a lot more to be worried about than a $15 minimum wage increase
4801 2018-11-06 16:03:46 As someone who lives in the state, I can say that oil and gas and related industry employees have high anxiety about Prop 112 passing and think its on the table they'll have to leave.

4808 2018-11-06 16:02:39 Oil usage will not be changed by people not buying palm oil. They'll simply change what is produced (if you're lucky). If you want to be advocating for any sort of boycott, you should be advertising people go on a plant based diet. Industrial fishing is a massive issue.
4809 2018-11-06 16:02:34 I perform my steaming during my “me time”, usually from 4-4:30am, after I launder the bath towels and before I make my groceries list. My baseboards only need scrubbing once a month, I put a protective coating of beeswax, linseed oil, and crushed mica (for some sparkle) on them.

4829 2018-11-06 16:00:51 You've misunderstood what I am saying. I'm saying that by boycotting palm oil, substitutes will need to be produced and these will be grown in other areas (that will then be deforested, their local inhabitants killed) and even more land will be required to produce the same amount

4835 2018-11-06 16:00:33 I think the fracking industry has new techniques of drilling sideways for miles that will enable them to comply with the terms of 112, although it will cost more to extract the gas/oil.

Sorry.
4862 2018-11-06 15:57:35 @TomOsborneMHA So to summarize your fiscal update, oil is up so our fiscal position has slightly improved and we as a government who done nothing to help the situation will take full credit. Is that about right ? #nlpoli

4876 2018-11-06 15:56:46 @VTBioenergy Refining the Hemp Oil is not enough to reach the grades needed for anything comparable to modern petroleum fuel grades and mixes with ethanol.

4909 2018-11-06 15:53:43 Palaces & private jets & immense corruption & vast high tech militaries are fine if they're not used. Wars are fine if they are petrostate vs petrostate eg. Iran-Iraq war, or Yemen war as long as they don't damage too many oil facilities. Bribing Western politicians  is fine.
4910 2018-11-06 15:53:43 I'm thinking about trying Danish oil for the woodworking tools I make. The only thing that stresses me out about these types of oils is the spontaneous combustion thing.

4912 2018-11-06 15:53:22 It is also an inherently speceist position, as reducing palm oil intake doesn't bring back what has already been damaged but will force other areas to be exploited for the growth of alternative oils, which will require even larger amounts of land resulting in more animal death.

4937 2018-11-06 15:51:17 I get that. But, who’s the intended audience? I’m a Christian, but I don’t believe in hell. Except maybe for that dude that sells the “No Evil Oil” on BET at 2am to people with cancer for like $50, but it’s just cooking oil.

4972 2018-11-06 15:48:09 Since oil bubble started in the 1970s, recycling the petrodollars has always been #1 problem. What can low-population petrostates buy that could spend all that money? Also how to recycle wealth in ways that don't harm Western interests? e.g. Spreading Jihadism.

4978 2018-11-06 15:47:25 Not even close on crude oil today.  Breakdown of support not a good sign. Want to say this is a trap, but the specs could keep driving it lower. Need a good inventory report to find support it seems.
4979 2018-11-06 15:47:24 The AER is filled with industry hacks that side with big oil every time. The AER should be disbanded and a new, impartial agency set up that will actually REGULATE the oil patch. This damn outfit hasnt been worth a damn for at least a decade.

4990 2018-11-06 15:46:13 I agree - the potential is there but hasn’t, at this point, engaged the broader community and business community. Getting the Flames on board and their marketing expertise and business connections would be huge. Engaging oil and gas leaders also...big tent lots of passion and Go!
4991 2018-11-06 15:46:10 Have I talked about how fucking stupid Amendment 9 in FL is?? It’s to ban offshore oil and gas drilling AND vaping indoors like I don’t give a FUCK if u vape around me 99% of the time it smells like fruity pebbles but we sure as shit can’t afford any more water pollution

5083 2018-11-06 15:37:59 Palm Oil itself isn't the issue, I've said this before. It's the underlying system which enables governments, corporations to tear down our trees, kill our animal friends and exploit our environment.
5084 2018-11-06 15:37:57 It'd be nice if these things worked like that but I don't see it happening.
5085 2018-11-06 15:37:56 Oil now being reforcast at $74/ barrel instead of $63 at budget 2018. It has to stay at about $71.5 for the rest of the year to maintain the $74 average. #nlpoli

5087 2018-11-06 15:37:53 Screw Congress. Just lead the way and the consumer will follow. We rely way too much on questionable, bought politicians to move the world forward. They are in the pocket of the oil lobby and they don’t care about the environment or the consumer.

5194 2018-11-06 15:29:14 out here voting and they bundled up offshore drilling with vaping

like, u hate big oil ruining the lives n habitats of millions of creatures for thousands of years to come?

so u must also hate people inhaling vapor from a tiny machine, right??

alexa, define mutually exclusive
5195 2018-11-06 15:29:10 A gun gets covered in toxic lead dust from the powder explosion. Gunks up the oil and makes the weapon literally poisonous to handle if you don't clean it.

(Not a gun owner, not a gun nut, just been to a range once. The toxic dust guns spew is part of the required safety class.)
5196 2018-11-06 15:29:07 My ankles hurt just watching people wear those.
5197 2018-11-06 15:28:53 I wish I had that optimism... But  today I'll be the super pessimist. Having a split legislative Branch will cause this country to stall more than a Studebaker with an oil leak

Vedanta mines, minerals, oil and ore.
5199 2018-11-06 15:28:44 A Government that cannot pay N18,000 also cannot pay N30,000....keep in mind, When salaries go up, pensions and allowances also go up.

Nigeria is borrowing to pay salaries...100% of the cash Nigeria makes from oil goes to pay salaries of ONLY Federal workers
5200 2018-11-06 15:28:38 Would the Maple Leafs ever consider eating Babcock's contract and bring Quenneville on board in his place? My guess is no but the guy on the unemployment line is likely better suited to coach the team Toronto has put together.
5201 2018-11-06 15:27:57 And a walking test... I hate it when I see women teetering around in them, ankles askew and knees wobbling. Somebody's gonna break something! I had 12+ years of ballet, I can run the 100yd dash in 6" heels if necessary, lol.
5202 2018-11-06 15:27:51 I see the football spreadsheet wankers are out in force. Imagine worrying about net spend, noodle sponsors or oil cunts instead of going along for the Bovril, a catch-up with your pals and the beers.

5208 2018-11-06 15:27:17 The problem is big pharmacies don't want it .So they fight it  They know it works and its cheaper than the pills they push . I read a story about a guy who cured his stage 3 prostate cancer using the oil extract . Its more money to treat that to cure . That's why they fight it .

5224 2018-11-06 15:26:29 And now it's a top 1 by a mile.

Agree sport needs a better balance for it to be interesting but should the work of clubs like Arsenal, Lpool, Utd I.e clubs that have built a heritage through hard work, youth and yep, expenditure of the back of a big fan base be penalised by oil?

5326 2018-11-06 15:15:50 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,  whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.

5337 2018-11-06 15:15:03 I used to eat loads of ghee when I lived in Bradford, loads of curries, 30 years later I have diabetes 2. Not sure it was the ghee, more the fact that I am a greedy fat bloke that likes cooking and eating. Only ever use olive oil nowadays.

5359 2018-11-06 15:11:37 clif is right, the Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal Express. Once you get past the stockholders, bank holding companies, multinational banking Corporations, & oil interests; it comes down to 8 families owning the Corp’s., that own the banks, that makeup the Fed.

5361 2018-11-06 15:11:26 Not surprised in the least to see Quenneville get his walking papers, as everyone knows his relationship with the Hawks front office has been strained for some time.

5366 2018-11-06 15:11:17 Colorado hasn’t been hostage by the oil business since the 1980s. It represents 1% of employment (about 35,000 people). They expose their workers to chemicals and death and will lay them off with no recourse at the drop of a hat. #frackingkills

5377 2018-11-06 15:10:17 A sense of calm and easy going is what I’ve experienced from taking CBD oil. Heart and Body Naturals is a good company to get it from. They show lab results on their website showing what all is in it. And the hemp is grown in the U.S. @bacardi_bays

5388 2018-11-06 15:09:43 So, instead of recognizing that the NDP doesn't represent their constituents, they toss one because she doesn't represent the NDP and anti oil coalition.

5390 2018-11-06 15:09:21 Nelson sponsored a 2006 bill banning oil drilling off Florida's Gulf Coast. In 2017 he said he wanted the ban to continue to 2027, but that it was "vigorously opposed by the oil industry."
5391 2018-11-06 15:09:16 Liberal plan has NB families getting lowest rebate in Cda while we have access to fewest alternatives. "backstop" plan doesn't return to the provincial economy the full amount taxed from business. The net result is NB is paying a tax so oil, steel, and cement in roc can prosper.
5392 2018-11-06 15:09:13 I swear. For us burning narkasur is just the beginning of diwali. Then after that like u said, mud and oil bath, food to crackers to diyas, lakshmi pujan, tulsi vivah too

5405 2018-11-06 15:07:45 The threat of U.S. sanctions on Iran drove the oil price to multiyear highs in October. Those penalties kicked in Monday with some exceptions that would allow those countries to continue temporary imports of Iranian crude without facing penalties.

5443 2018-11-06 15:03:18 I hope for a "soft" PO scenario where increasing cost of production drives price of oil higher such that demand softens first in an orderly manner.  Better that peak happens from the demand side (we leave oil) rather than production hitting an ERoEI brick wall (oil leaves us)!

5475 2018-11-06 14:59:37 INDIAN REFINERS IOC IOC.NS, MRPL MRPL.NS HAVE PLACED ORDER TO BUY IRANIAN OIL IN DEC - INDUSTRY SOURCES
IOC TO BUY 6 MLN BBLS, MRPL WILL BUY 3 MLN BBLS IN DEC #OOTT #OPEC #USsanctions #IranSanctions
5476 2018-11-06 14:59:36 Plenty of evidence backed by science showing the oil industry is a plague and we should be backing green energy tech
5477 2018-11-06 14:59:24 Spanking!
5478 2018-11-06 14:59:24 gladio: we're going to fry things in oil so this isn't the best time to mess around because i dont want us to get hurt
noctis: frying things in oil is LITERALLY the best time to mess around
5479 2018-11-06 14:59:14 Assuming you don’t believe we live a Walt Disney movie - do you honestly believe that Western warfare is because we are the bastions of peace and all things good?!  The very nature of war is massively profitable.  Think of the targets of modern war? Oil, minerals ...
5480 2018-11-06 14:59:10 おやすみなさい。。。
5481 2018-11-06 14:59:09 อยากหน้าเหลืองเหรอ
5482 2018-11-06 14:59:06 Try a few drops of CBD oil. Works wonders. “Dog pot” we call it but it’s perfectly safe. You can get down Holland and barret. You can get stuff specifically for pets but I suspect the only difference is the label.
5483 2018-11-06 14:58:47 It needs to be banned. Period. Why do hybrids if you’re just going to burn oil anyway. The cars are more than capable enough without that crap. If you can’t build the power in, don’t try to cheat it in with air polluting gimmicks.
5484 2018-11-06 14:58:42 Nigerians in general, but I’d also say our food especially with all the oil and maggi, lack of exercise etc
5485 2018-11-06 14:58:41 I hope voters in #Colorado will vote against #Prop112.  Prop112 is a job & economy killer. 

Per Platts: “Proposition 112 would curtail gas production by 45% and oil production by 54% within five years.”

Don’t California Colorado folks.
5486 2018-11-06 14:58:40 It seems to Fox news is beginning to irritate Trumps supporters for some reason. It has to be money since that’s the green oil that runs the media machine .
5487 2018-11-06 14:58:38 So basically the diet that im consuming rn has 
- no chicken, fish , beef, egg
- no oil, butter
- no dairy products, no ice cream
- least seasoning
- double amount of veg & fruits

5498 2018-11-06 14:57:26 .@SamGyimah looking for the positives in #brexit - with financial services less profitable and North Sea oil on decline, UK Universities can step up to plate to deliver a robust #research and #development driven economy.
5499 2018-11-06 14:57:26 Donald congratulations.

You are The lead Snake oil salesman.
5500 2018-11-06 14:57:24 I feel like cleaning up my diet. I have a really fast metabolism & I run almost every day. But I feel like I'm doing my body an injustice by tuning the engine, & using dirty oil to keep it running. Even small inconceivable changes make the world of a difference. #DoAnything #Live

5505 2018-11-06 14:57:03 Very smart of dawn to do this. Not only only helping the environment by cleaning up oil spills but also saving the wildlife!
5506 2018-11-06 14:56:58 

Yeah, gotta do some drilling for oil off the coast of Florida before I go.

5510 2018-11-06 14:56:27 ERoEI should be ultimately reflected in the cost of production, since it takes energy from oil to run everything to drill for oil.  Lower ERoEI -> higher cost / barrel. "Hard" PO should happen when cost/bbl starts to spiral with price rec'd for the oil causing crash in demand.
5511 2018-11-06 14:56:21 iya bener bgt bahkan aku udh ke store gedenya gaada.

Why do you want to give away 92% of scots oil and gas wealth to keep England afloat?
You are giving away Scotland`s future prosperity!
5519 2018-11-06 14:55:48 UPDATE 7-Oil prices down on Iran sanction exemptions, demand concerns
1 Hour Ago
*Washington grants temporary waivers to Iran's top buyers. Washington gave 180- day exemptions to eight importers- China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey.
5520 2018-11-06 14:55:35 I only saw Zambia and Angola sign for Indeni the oil supply MOU, where is the soon to be announced strategic partner in the deal
5521 2018-11-06 14:55:32 Indy fans are expecting a team from to 00’s, and not a team that’s being rebuilt correctly. #spoiled. Lucas Oil is one of the best venues in all of sports. It’s a shame that people aren’t going to support their team.
5522 2018-11-06 14:55:25 Re @rluff Robyn Luff and the #abndp it will be ironic when it comes out that her issue is a desire to destroy the Ab Oilpatch-but the political masters have suddenly found religion and NEED oil royalties to fund their ideology. 

Not to mention the safety in the workplace irony!
5523 2018-11-06 14:55:14 welcome to florida they bundled it with shit about stopping oil drilling to deter millenials/gen z from voting against it

5531 2018-11-06 14:54:36 The last thing we need is more drilling in Alaska! How soon people forget the environmental damage the Exxon Valdez disaster caused. I'm sure the pressure is building to drill because the flow of oil from the current wells is running out and Alaska's leaders need the money.
5532 2018-11-06 14:54:34 Or you know continuing useless wars, further fucking up the healthcare system, actually being worse for the economy, degrading standards for public schools, letting coal and oil companies rape the land, etc. 
Nothing in there is particularly good aside from his stance on 2A
5533 2018-11-06 14:54:26 Trying to jump start domestic shale oil industry which require $60+ crude. 
Also more oil revenue in gulf states means more weapons sales.
5534 2018-11-06 14:54:25 jfc it's like the bottom of the death barrel. Massive earthquakes and flaming water out of people's taps and "the EPA contaminated a river! Let's let everybody with an oil and gas lease or who wants one just torch the worldddddddd!"

5539 2018-11-06 14:53:37 Thank you for this tweet and link. Made my day   

Any day wherein obscurantism and assorted other snake oil stalls lose influence is a *good* day indeed.

Roll on enlightenment in the U.K. & the US (amongst others...looking at ye, Turkey)
5540 2018-11-06 14:53:18 This is funny. Yesterday infusions to your campaign from Koch Bros and Exxon showed up. We already know Houston-based oil & methane companies are funders. Have we been annexed by Houston?
5541 2018-11-06 14:53:02 Shared a pic abt anxiety and...

"Irish hinga... get off your fone and huminga ka."
"When anxiety attacks... talk to a friend and pray for calmness of your heart and wisdom of your brain."
"Gusto mo bigyan kita essential oil? Pampakalma?"

Huhuhu MA'AM KRIZZIA IS EVERYTHING. 
5542 2018-11-06 14:52:53 نأمل ذلك .
5543 2018-11-06 14:52:48 Hahaha sis cari je anything kat watsons. I just cari based on ingredients, kalau takde mineral oil tu i pakai je. Kalau fav Dr Morita, dkt guardian ada.
5544 2018-11-06 14:52:40 Received an email with news that the man who gave me my first real break into the UK oil & gas industry, had died. I remember sitting across the interview table from Stephen Black, almost 10 years ago, this hopeful Nigerian qualified lawyer....
5545 2018-11-06 14:52:39 Go on LinkedIn, search for people in the oil and gas network.
5546 2018-11-06 14:52:35 What's actually really brave is me going into work after forgetting to put oil absorbing powder on

5553 2018-11-06 14:51:44 Then fight to get them on the ballot. Organize to get the politics we need. 
Work to make real choices possible. Because oil is on the ballot, war is on the ballot, voting rights are on the ballot, and Black, brown, and Jewish lives are on the ballot.
5554 2018-11-06 14:51:44 おやすみすみす！！
5555 2018-11-06 14:51:42 yeah i feel we deserved a bit of success, just a shame its come from dodgy oil money, corruption, bribery and falsifying accounts, typical City hey! 
people slag our fans base, but we dont have decades of glory hunters........yet!
5556 2018-11-06 14:51:41 shameless people never get embarrassed. which muslim world you are talking about if you talk about saudi arabia they never count pakies as human being they use your army like toilet paper in exchange of some gallons of oil.
5557 2018-11-06 14:51:39 Yessir
5558 2018-11-06 14:51:28 Very much like CNRL trying to bring more Chinese oil and gas workers into Alberta.   Will Wisconsin employees be required to know some form of the Chinese language before being hired?

5560 2018-11-06 14:51:23 I love going hard on my early mornin workouts. What’s even better is taking @NaturesUltra CBD oil every day. If you want a better recovery, less pain, less stress, better sleep and more energy, CBD oil is what you need. #CBDlife #TuesdayMotivation #energy #anxietyrelief #healthy
5561 2018-11-06 14:51:21 Okay why Iran doesn’t attack the US to defend the innocent people? Instead they attack innocent people in Najran just to get hold of the oil market.

5578 2018-11-06 14:49:40 There is a mini-supermarket in Harare, along RGMugabe Rd corner Angwa, where they used to be Food World, they sell the local cooking oil in US$ or 7,50Bond. Pachena chena. Feya feya hahahahaha lol.
5579 2018-11-06 14:49:35 Red Bull, Vaping, might go buy some honey thick CBD oil, DEFINITELY want to buy some alcohol esp if things go sideways lol
5580 2018-11-06 14:49:34 I'm honestly willing to believe that it may one day be profitable to at least move away from oil (it's gotta run out some day, right?), but the issue is that by that point it'll be too late. We really needed to go 100% green 10 years ago.

5589 2018-11-06 14:48:40 Maybe it made sense while oil prices were below $50. Not so much now. And also lost opportunity to build any infrastructure in NY instead of PA.
5590 2018-11-06 14:48:36 Yes I knew that , we used it feeding cattle and many other by products 

Where I am, beans (IP mostly) goes to à destination market (shipped out) I believe 

RR beans are mostly crush for oil and soymeal
5591 2018-11-06 14:48:33 I use pure cannabis oil just lately mixed with organic olive oil and take a few drops every couple day.
Was taking live culture tablets for gut health too.
Hot sauce on everything keeps the chest clear lol
5592 2018-11-06 14:48:23 His reasons were based on ptroleum products importation & non-functional refineries...these are misnormal .
How Oil price can be below N90:
1.Resuscitating the refineries.
2.A shift from current output cost subsidy to input cost subsidy.
3.Increasing no of refineries.
5593 2018-11-06 14:48:20 Perhaps they could supply oil to us instead of Middle East.

 More competitive gas prices better paid and better treated employees that's what would happen.
5749 2018-11-06 14:33:53 Hence why usa attacked iraq and syria because they started selling oil for euros and gold. Which would have ruined their free fed reserve money tree. Usa is in serious shit, but they are smart and im wondering what their escape plan is? Maybe adopting crypto is their plan?
5750 2018-11-06 14:33:51 Got an oil change on my break at work so I could squeeze in every possible minute before my second job.
5751 2018-11-06 14:33:48 Well at least its not immediately fatal. Usually that's just oil burning off on the engine block. Still a leak somewhere tho

5757 2018-11-06 14:33:16 Just banked our 9% profit (in 27 days) on Cabot Oil & Gas (COG -NYSE) for our US subscribers....ka-ching 
5758 2018-11-06 14:33:09 A penetrating view!

The US preference for binary choices of friends and enemies is long, and derives from naïveté, the Cold War, and oil - and now the personal illusions of Trump/Kushner as well. 

A balanced policy is long overdue!
5759 2018-11-06 14:33:01 "Educated"
Yet most of these people can't tie a knot other than their shoes, change an oil filter, start a fire, handle themselves in a fight, raise livestock, catch a fish, clean a gun or even shoot straight for that matter.

5762 2018-11-06 14:32:53 2/2. To my second query regarding margins in future due to current scenario BEPL replied, “ Yes if the dollar and crude oil continues to remain strong the margins will decline.” I loved the company’s integrity. Honest and no false promises.
5763 2018-11-06 14:32:49 I live here and will vote straight Republican per usual.  Sadly, California is doomed. The Middle East has oil (to prop their 6th century mentality) and California has year-around great weather.  You can’t sink either, but you can get out.

5773 2018-11-06 14:32:17 These petrol companies are an outrage! Oil is currently $63 a barrel, it has dropped $13 a barrel in 5 weeks! I should know, I trade it. And yet it’s been going up at the pumps. Utterly disgusting, what’s worse is no-one really takes them to task!!!

5785 2018-11-06 14:31:01 No true, hyper inflation will kick in for 2 reasons, one over printing and 2, the lack of demand for the dollar and since the petro dollar system will soon collapse there will ne 80% less demand from oil consuming countries. (To buy oil, u need USD)

5827 2018-11-06 14:26:57 Climate plan: freeload off other countries' climate work & focus on extracting every tonne of CO2 out of oil patch. Immoral, irresponsible, expensive, and doomed to failure. Time's running out; cheapest oil "wins" until then. Better to plan transition. CTax + rebate best option.

5870 2018-11-06 14:23:02 You are very right, it is a question of when not if because either oil dries out or it becomes irrelevant and commercially not viable as nations move away from fossil fuel.

5887 2018-11-06 14:21:40 So it appears I have an oil leak, which only happens sometimes, only after I switch the engine off, and I have no idea where it's from. #VWT25
5888 2018-11-06 14:21:34 Such insanity. I just heard that they have a surplus of oil, gas prices will be going down but for only a few months, as the Orange one, just put sanctions back on Iran, that will drive gas prices back up. Putting out the Blue Wave vibes!

5894 2018-11-06 14:20:59 You should study history. Instead of pre-deciding socialism is the cause of it, keep an open mind and study. Venezuela's 90% of GDP is dependent on crude oil, which fell in price, they had 3 generations of corrupt govt back to back. But no, socialism is the only explanation.
5895 2018-11-06 14:20:56 Nice, isn't it? Thank the plunge in the stock market for hitting oil as well as Saudi Arabia and Russia talking about boosting oil production. Nothing to do w/ election though.
5896 2018-11-06 14:20:52 And now we're basically "giving" our oil away, won't help our gdp!
5897 2018-11-06 14:20:49 $70 for oil change I’m waiting until Miami next time jiffy lube oil change $24.99 df
5898 2018-11-06 14:20:46 So bringing in oil from the middle east where environmental factors don't exist is ok, you idiots really don't have a clue, it's going to happen sooner or later, why shouldn't Canadians benefit from it. So every time you leave your cave, you're still using oil products.
5899 2018-11-06 14:20:24 I don't need to read anything Keyamo says. It is almost impossible crashing Petrol price to N90 while Crude Oil price is above $70 per barrel, and a dollar is above N360.

@Atiku needs to come explain his plans for that if he really put out such information because it is flawed.

But I think it's a much more obvious proximate cause than perestroika, Afghanistan or Chernobyl and it's often overlooked.

6003 2018-11-06 14:11:28 New tough us sanctions against Iran have come into force. After a three-year respite, the country will again lose the opportunity to do business with the West, lose the main earnings - from the sale of oil - and will be cut off from the global financial system.

6039 2018-11-06 14:07:20 Let me put it differently, the idea that the Reagan Administration and the Saudis coalesced to crash the oil market to make the USSR collapse is none sense

6041 2018-11-06 14:07:07 You are not alone, Patriot
You are not alone.

The marauders could have, in my sleep,
Slaughtered me like a goat
But you guarded me like gold.
Why then will you be alone?

Let our Olive pour oil on your wound too
And the balm of the nation soothe you.
Intrepid, you are not alone!

6051 2018-11-06 14:05:36 The oil market has transitioned from one that is dramatically undersupplied with adequate spare capacity to a market that is now more balanced but with little to no spare capacity.  Which is more bullish for oil?  Is the OPEC supply increase actually bullish medium term? #OOTT

 - use and eyebrow pencil for smaller and more defined strokes that still look natural 
 - use a spooly and vasaline to keep them in place
 - clean them up with a little concealer
 - apply coconut oil to help them grow thicker
 - get them threaded/waxed regularly!!!

6069 2018-11-06 14:03:24 Bio oil is a scam. It should be discontinued 
6070 2018-11-06 14:03:13 For those who asked about Smoothie's skin.... As background, when he was signed over to us, he had skin issues across his back. Scales, dandruff, oil clots.
6071 2018-11-06 14:03:12 Yeah, but when a government puts children in cages, attacks women and minorities, sell our future to oil companies... I'd say it's a bit complicated. 
6072 2018-11-06 14:03:07 How utterly naive. Are the Democratic Republic of North Korea, Democratic? Venezuela? Attempted assassinations by CIA, USA sanctions, black marketerring and OPEC and Saudi Kingdom controlling oil prices. But no, let’s blame it totally on socialism 
6073 2018-11-06 14:03:04 All opposition say BJP is Party of Hindutva. But only now there is restriction for crackers. Thank God at any time one can take oil bath on Deepavali Day.

6077 2018-11-06 14:02:54 Trump is the type of conjob who says to you, you are going to die if you don't buy his snake oil, and after you drink his snake oil, he tells you, "see how much more healthy you feel"?, knowing fully well that you are not really any better than you were before you drank his serum
6078 2018-11-06 14:02:53 Many states were created to get federal allocation which is gotten from crude oil sales.   We know there are few states that have IGR, many others only wait for monthly allocation. So with crude oil (federal allocation) gone so many states will merge to 20 or less.
6079 2018-11-06 14:02:53 Not hard to give respect when you sell the polymers that go into oh so many plastic car parts. $tsla is a nemesis of big oil is about the biggest FUD there is.
6080 2018-11-06 14:02:52 Infrastructure investment is like  maintenance on you car. Obama might have changed the oil, but we haven't done the brakes or even changed the tires since Clinton. Republicans are right & we can buy a new car with the money we save, but not if we blow it in Vegas on the slots.
6081 2018-11-06 14:02:51 You slithering snake, who the hell do you think you're kidding....of course you met up with Trump....he has some snake oil to flog in Cleveland  #VoteBlueToSaveDemocracy

6130 2018-11-06 13:58:44 The economic growth is mainly in the offshore oil industry and mining industry in Labrador. A very small percentage of NLer's work in either of those industries. So the economic growth will not really have an impact on most of us.

6453 2018-11-06 13:25:45 #crudeoil prices have had investors worried for quite some time now and with the #USsanctions on #Iran
#US President #DonaldTrump had a bit of good news 8 countries, including #India, have been exempted from immediate penalties should they continue importing #Oil #IranSanctions

6458 2018-11-06 13:24:59 Just some reminders to #Michigan voters on #ElectionDay #MidtermElections2018 

1) Republicans allowed the #Flintwatercrisis to happen

2) Republicans destroyed our burgeoning movie industry 

3) Republicans want to drill for oil in the Great Lakes

6460 2018-11-06 13:24:51 But buying oil can be done centrally by gov or gov-owned enterprises, right?
6461 2018-11-06 13:24:47 Yes - clove bud oil is really good for numbing the pain

6475 2018-11-06 13:23:19 We ought to reject the notion that WW1 was a fight for our freedom, it  was about the acquisition of oil, power, influence and land. A better way to acknowledge the sacrifice made by service personnel would be to donate to RBL/Help For Heroes but wear a white poppy for peace.

6477 2018-11-06 13:23:10 If the money gained from gold is embezzled the same way the money from oil and gas has been embezzled it won't do much good for Venezuela but some people will do very well.

6483 2018-11-06 13:21:49 Sanctions! What sanctions? This is all a stupid play especially after excluding big and small countries from oil trade! Does anyone remrmber the sanctions agains Iraq-Saddam? Oil for food, no fly zone?
6484 2018-11-06 13:21:48 I voted because want the economy to grow, and people forget about recession. We have very strong economy thanks to tax cut, less regulations, Republicans support oil gas industry. Jobs!!!!
6485 2018-11-06 13:21:43 Well I guess my eyes are all kinds of messed up. Have astigmatism, I'm high risk of getting glaucoma by the time I'm 30. One of my test ducks don't produce the oil it's suppose to.

6489 2018-11-06 13:21:12 Yeah a little different mainly it's more potent. Where your blue dream bud is usually 17-24% THC whereas your oil is 89.8% I think is what the blue dream cartridge is. So yeah definitely a knock your dick in the dirt type difference for sure.

6502 2018-11-06 13:19:34 Do you have Whole Foods in UK? I love them, especially their cheese selection, but why do they smell so bad? It's not just the patchouli oil everywhere, it's something else. Maybe it's the produce section and aging organic fruit and veggies.

6504 2018-11-06 13:19:15 Was in a boarding school so we used to make small holes on the bat (mid to bottom part) with a compass and apply mustard oil. Then tape the bottom of the bat with medical adhesive tape.

I think the Xenomorph exoskeleton is more than just your standard black - I always believed there was more brown and grey on them; but an oil effect would be hella cool.
For the tongue being white, maybe that just cause of drool?

6511 2018-11-06 13:18:51 @altonbrown Help! Frying my turkey for the first time this year. Can’t use peanut oil because of an allergy in the family. What oil do you recommend?
6512 2018-11-06 13:18:42 Texass. It’s all about oil, gas, greed, money and bigotry.
6513 2018-11-06 13:18:36 At this point I think @TheDemocrats are sending staff out to estate sales to buy military memorabilia specifically to create these fake accounts.

6517 2018-11-06 13:18:19 #voteSolar #climatevoter vote for voting rights. Vote Dem. then call your reps of all parties and ask that they pledge #nofossilfuelmoney. Democracy demands, as @billmckibben has said, that we “break the political power of the oil-and-gas industry.”
6518 2018-11-06 13:18:09 Tyler took the day off which means he can go with me to get the oil changed! Yaaaaay lol
6519 2018-11-06 13:17:55 That is the sexiest pic. The oil on ur body is just u really do have the best body in the biz.
6520 2018-11-06 13:17:47 @ImranKhanPTI @DrAyeshaNaveed @zartajgulwazir @ShehryarAfridi1 when theorise of crude oil and petrol dropped, the government increased the taxation. Now the prices have gone sky high, yet the additional taxation has not been removed. It will be a relief to all.

6566 2018-11-06 13:13:13 The bigger issue is both Obama and Trump have dramatically reduced our influence by providing a window of opportunity to RU to exert influence via Syria as well as permanent presence in Tartus. If there is war, RU oil helps recapitalize Putin’s treasury while we go into tailspin.

6573 2018-11-06 13:12:41 Clearly investors walked away with lighter wallets and a bad taste in their mouths, but I don't think much of that can be attributed to management. Perhaps the company was too sanguine about a recovery in oil prices, and unsophisticated investors were fooled?

You know who funded the Sardar Patel statue?The public sector companies IOC,GAIL,ONGC....  "voluntarily" paid
Please note there is no Anil Ambani, Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, Baba Ramdev company funding this statue!
Most of the funders are Oil sector PSUs.

6602 2018-11-06 13:09:41 The United States renewed sanctions against Iran designed to cripple Iran's oil and shipping industries, but granted temporary waivers to top customers including China and India to keep buying crude oil from the country without penalties.
6603 2018-11-06 13:09:28 Hi Lisa, most of our products contain ingredients that can be derived from either RSPO palm or coconut oil depending on the crop yields. The products that don't are our Fabric Conditioner and Floor Cleaner

I've done both. Oiless infrared and oil. 
Though the oiless wasn't terrible, fried in oil is MUCH better. Couple words of advice,  peanut oil is the best oil to use. 
Regardless of what Google says, 4.5 minutes per pound is optimal cooking time.
6605 2018-11-06 13:09:17 All cars and trucks will be battery or hydrogen powered. The only thing up for debate is when. Most people will choose battery over hydrogen due to the lower cost per mile. Oil powered cars will become like steam engines - something you only see in museums and at special events.

6614 2018-11-06 13:08:25 Thanks. I just haven't seen any kind of smoking gun proving that management were bad actors. PRE actually 10-bagged from inception to its peak, and generated strong earnings, cash flows, and dividends. Looks like the oil crash and loss of the Rubiales field killed it.
6615 2018-11-06 13:08:18 They will use them to get cheap oil and sell Iran more expensive goods.
6616 2018-11-06 13:08:03 futuro da PETR:

-Mesmo na mão do governo voltou a ser uma Oil Company.
6617 2018-11-06 13:07:57 @LarryEl34789755 I found Barrak Obama's bowing to a Saudi oil peddler insulting to our flag, our soldiers, and in general, all citizens of the greatest country on earth. The best thing about it is the fact that he can't be president again.
6618 2018-11-06 13:07:57 I'm convinced an alternative to petrol and diesel already exists but it's patent is being kept in a locked safe at the oils company HQ. Any alternative to petrochemicals would cause oil prices to plummet and oil companies obviously don't want that.

6628 2018-11-06 13:06:39 Nah, Nigeria responds to any opposition or assertiveness with violence.

SW under Abacha faced theirs and had to start the OPC to force a stalemate.

SE had 3m killed in a civil war.

SS used threats to oil production to force a stalemate too.

It's a general thing.

Why are we not focusing far more on letting nature show  is how to consume and pollute less?

6726 2018-11-06 12:55:56 That does it, China is more interested in saving the Planet than the great USA!  Let’s just vote out the Republicans so we can take our planet  back!!! It’s a no brainer.  They will destroy the planet  with their greed for OIL AND MONEY!!!!!!!

6729 2018-11-06 12:55:43 a simple way to commoditization of cannabis is tie price of silver to one once of cannabis flower, and gold to one once cannabis oil, at current market prices suggests silver value of $80 and gold $2150 in a perfect world
6730 2018-11-06 12:55:35 A group of oil companies want to convince you that fighting big oil and climate change is a waste of time. I like to read the comments and see how pretty much everyone they’re targeting disagrees with them.
6731 2018-11-06 12:55:31 As I write the CIA that had been sent by @HillaryClinton are watching in pain because they had been sent to check signs of war but they are sad that there are none. Hillary is hurting she wanted the Turkana oil @prophetahuva
6732 2018-11-06 12:55:09 Thanks for sharing this, very important. Law makers love making this hard to understand for most. The one that gets me is coast line oil drilling and baking at work???? Maybe have those separate.

6734 2018-11-06 12:55:01 Scotland’s deficits (Debt) since 

1980: £163 billion
1998: £171 billion
2007: £136 billion (SNP took power)

All of the above deficits/debt includes all oil revenues attributed to Scotland via a geographical share

Scotland is now being subsidised massively by England.

6755 2018-11-06 12:52:17 It was made out of money from all oil marketing companies.. they had to pay through their nose..no wonder they couldn reduce oil prices

6790 2018-11-06 12:48:50 Good things we keep kids out of coal mines. Now we just keep them around burning hot oil and slippery surfaces.
6791 2018-11-06 12:48:49 I was "brainwashed" too, yet somehow - amazingly and against all odds - was vegetarian for a number of years before being unable to resist a pork pie.

6795 2018-11-06 12:48:01 @theJeremyVine yep I've started stockpiling, I have a box in the wardrobe that I'm adding to every week. It's got tinned vegetables & fruit, pasta, olive oil, rice in it.
6796 2018-11-06 12:47:41 Thank you boss for your favour with Iran to supply oil...But we are unlucky in the meanwhile production cost salary and overheads including taxes our Govt has to retain the same price or some time may be further increased

6804 2018-11-06 12:46:59 Drawing a line in  the sand, mini bear market in oil is over today. The "talk down" on oil continues but will set the stage for less investment in exploration & production, lower EV sales, higher demand. The State has still not figured out the cure for high prices is high prices.
6805 2018-11-06 12:46:57 I did love how they made it so easy to examine the issue.

6809 2018-11-06 12:46:40 Understandable, just found the "coincidence" and figured I'd share, I wouldn't be surprised if this stopped trading like a "stock". The speculation is that of oil in the 1800's before the industrial revolution began. It has the potential to change how money is moved as we know it

6825 2018-11-06 12:45:00 Cooking on stainless steel requires knowing how to cook on stainless steel.

1. Meat sticks until it stops sticking. Turn it over when it stops sticking, not before.

2. Oil and then water cleans off any cooked on stuff on the bottom, this is called deglazing.

6835 2018-11-06 12:43:30 The oil industry is important in itsekiri land today. As far back as  1974 Warri Local Government area( the homeland of the itsekiri) was  known to have accounted for "50% of oil produced in the midst and 25% of  the country's total production"
6836 2018-11-06 12:43:28 The oil smells bad
6837 2018-11-06 12:43:28 Science says oil is made from plants. I think it’s more plausible that plants are made from oil !

6841 2018-11-06 12:42:33 @Kristileenews tuba is mainly in high school marching bands. Sousaphone is mostly used in concert bands, but DCI uses them for marching. They carry them like a rocket launcher, on shoulder. BTW, go Siegel high band as they compete at Lucus Oil this weekend! Represent TN!
6842 2018-11-06 12:42:29 Oil prices down by 15% over past month with £/$ staying largely stable. As petrol peaked at about 131p a 15% drop in oil prices should see petrol prices drop to 111p. I guarantee that won’t happen so another example of how we’re being ripped off.

6860 2018-11-06 12:40:53 Reported - or resulted in arrest crime - quite possibly.
But unreported, unapprehended crime?
Particularly stuff like cottage industry level conversion of pot into hash oil, grey marketing of medical marijuana?

Vote for candidates that will reign in Big Banks, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Media, Big Tech, and AAA Publishers. 

It's the only way we're getting out of this mess.
7076 2018-11-06 12:15:24 If I insulted anyone, it was you, not the whole industry. We are to believe that you, a member of the media and opinion writer for Bloomberg, were riding the fence on whether to vote red or blue? In other words, you are part of the ~1% of Bloomberg employees who aren’t liberal?
7077 2018-11-06 12:15:18 I donate to the RBL but I do not wear a poppy. The red poppy backdrop of establishment propaganda is truly sickening. People should look at the British government/establishment and its involvement in helping to bring about WW1. Tommies died for oil, power, influence & land grabs.

7082 2018-11-06 12:15:00 True but challenging them to a Nuclear Arms Race is not the answer ! Plus ending the Iran Deal when they were allowing inspections and using wimpy sanctions ( many were granted waivers to buy Iranian Oil anyway ) won't make the world any safer either
7083 2018-11-06 12:14:49 Typically oil and gas cos strive to achieve a balance of oil vs gas in their portfolio. At the time Mobil was hunting for more oil reserves and hence this one was not a strategic fit. Also projections showed gas prices were depressed so that was another consideration.
7084 2018-11-06 12:14:42 This is presumably only sovereign debt, so excludes $ billions of quasi-sov'n entities' (SK, KMG) borrowings from Chinese banks, mostly for upgrading oil&gas refining infrastructure

SA bomb Yemen for over 5 years, causing the biggest humanitarian crisis, killing innocent children and NO response. 

It’s because Yemen doesn’t have two major oil pipelines like Syria does.

7134 2018-11-06 12:07:34 other people are right, your skin could be overproducing oils bc it’s dry. but if it’s truly oily, you’d probs want to stay away from face products that have oil in them, so oil free cleansers/moisturizers or easier, buy gel moisturizers. You shouldn’t put oils on oils.
7135 2018-11-06 12:07:31 Exactly.  Keep that MAGA shit out of here.  Texas needs it’s diversity.  Oil Field Services, Construction, and Refineries desperately need Mexican immigrants - legal or not.

7152 2018-11-06 12:04:34 #UKOG I suspect the serious oil biz that DL is eluding to may well involve
matters which when sorted will be to the benefit of all Weald investor. Any suggestion that #angs or #dor will merge with UKOG
is deliberate misinformation

7153 2018-11-06 12:04:26 What's importance to me is sustainability and encouraging clean energy! We have to start looking for alternatives to oil. Don't you agree? It's better for the environment and our pockets.

7157 2018-11-06 12:04:04 I will not light crackers, instead I have bought traditional mitti ke diye(clay oil lamps) from an old street shopkeeper. This will help to keep the environment clean & will help the traditional artisans too. #GreenDiwali #EcoDiwali
7158 2018-11-06 12:03:19 Explain cooling during The Little Ice Age. Only one degree of temperature increase since 1890 (where's the beef?). Total year worldwide oil production is 1.5 trillion gallons. A cubic mile is 1.1 trillion gallons. Compared to forest fires & volcanoes, oil is a minor pollutant????

7162 2018-11-06 12:02:51 Can Iran really circumvent US sanctions?
The American president put all the countries of the world between two options, 
either dealing with Iran in oil and money or dealing with USA! 
Those who want USA has to lose Iran!

7175 2018-11-06 12:00:27 I was going through CBI documents... in the entire South Africa, probably about 5 companies have been given access to directly to international market l in the essential oil industry
7176 2018-11-06 12:00:27 It's certainly not Iran. Sources tell Syrian govt. legally invited them & Russia while US is ILLEGALLY there & occupying most of the OIL FIELDS & 30% of land which belongs to Syria, East of Euphrates, where the ISIS too have their settlements. It's not a mere coincidence.

7191 2018-11-06 11:58:19 @Preston @tombradby @Anna_Soubry Close all Saudi Embassies worldwide, prevent more murders, cancel all military contracts, stop purchasing their oil. If Assad did what they have done in Turkey then there would be uproar and military action.

7199 2018-11-06 11:57:13 3 film scenes i’ve watched in the cinema that have given me the most goosebumps: no man’s land scene from wonder woman, the ‘cmon farrier’ oil scene in dunkirk and now the live aid concert in bohemian rhapsody. what will be next
7200 2018-11-06 11:57:11 Right? But as this will go on, I think the issue of Abyei should be brought up & addressed. Kiir needs to push for it. When Bashir mediated our peace talks he brought the topic of oil on the table. Kiir must also present #SouthSudan’s interest.
7201 2018-11-06 11:57:06 Hmmmm.. let's see ...
1. clay used for diya will cause erosion of the earth layer..
2. cotton used for batti could be better used to clothe the poor...
3. and of course oil for the diya can be better used to feed the hungry..

7217 2018-11-06 11:55:12 I’m still thinking why #Sanchi’s AIS was off when accident happened. That’s why I asked you to see if these tankers were discharging oil to certain destinations like Syria or NK. There was no sanctions or any reason last year for Sanchi to turn its AIS off.

7223 2018-11-06 11:54:08 This is only tangentially related, but you might know the answer: what is the output of the burning of Barium, and would it be safe (wrt pollutants) to have a small lantern indoors that burned some?
I know Barium makes green fire, and a green-fire-oil-lantern would be so cool :)
7224 2018-11-06 11:54:06 I’ve been told that Islamists are infiltrating the caravan of refugees and that is why Trump is targeting them. If This is so,why doesn’t he lift his sanctions so that Venezuela can sell her oil and once again look after its citizens. Why create refugees, WHY ?

7228 2018-11-06 11:53:34 Nah mate. Just the Bahamas bank thing is very political and linked to US embargo on Venezuelan oil. They're not happy about anyone getting around their blockade. I'd never call you Elmer!
7229 2018-11-06 11:52:45 Save it.  In this insane political environment, its the only issue that is opposed by Reps AND Dems.  This is an extreme measure backed by Green Peace and outside money disguised as grassroots.  Oil and Gas money is at least local

7232 2018-11-06 11:52:03 Hemp production is a large market but it won't take off. Hemp can be used to create a biodegradable fuel apparently. Like oil tycoons would allow that to happen
7233 2018-11-06 11:51:45 I agree In Venezuela gasoline cost about 0.01 $/L... In China 1.18 $/L. 
This comparison (of oil prices) will reflect on energy cost (and so on mining cost) imo.

7240 2018-11-06 11:51:01 You make good sense. True. We know that already.  But the Bay store doesn't have my banking records. "Data is the new oil", (heard in a bar), and StatsCan taking the lazy bully route to find out how much gasping room there is for more taxation. Don't kid yourself.

7242 2018-11-06 11:50:11 Let's talk about oil.
So many prominent hedge fund legends if we can call them that are suggesting that oil is going to 150 or 200 a barrel.
Its now sliding despite sanctions to 60.
Are we going to see massive losses with these funds.
Watch the demise of these experts #Commodity

7288 2018-11-06 11:42:33 True no cash all money paid for Iranian’s oil by those 8 countries it will be thru bank transactions and for humanitarian purposes, so the Iranian after sanctions will not have excuses like starvation 
7289 2018-11-06 11:42:22 Lou Bartletta- I am voting for this guy who will give us relieve from unsustainable gas tax in PA. Also, tax on oil drillers- they tax you to death here.

7295 2018-11-06 11:42:06 after looting the people of India by GST and Demonitization and bringing the economy to the worst state now they are begging to RBI. This is the condition after oil prices are at record high.But not everyone is available for sale and Mr. PM should understand that. Good Job RBI.

7297 2018-11-06 11:41:38 I often wonder how a carbon tax can affect the weather? Farmers want rain, ski hills want snow and cold temperatures, sailors want lots of wind and pilots want good vfr weather. I will be paying $40 for every fill up of home heating oil for whom.
7298 2018-11-06 11:41:32 The problem with that - what if the place also sells meat and the seafood is cooked in the same oil/utensil?
7299 2018-11-06 11:41:31 @SecPompeo Seriously friend of Iranians? US ruined Iran once took the power from Shah, to control oil price and when tried to clean up that mess made bigger messes by starting wars in Middle East which caused lots of loss for many families in region and American soldiers’ as well
7300 2018-11-06 11:41:10 My daith piercing hasnt wanted to heal for shit... so I started putting tea tree oil on it nd boom, it's getting there

7307 2018-11-06 11:40:22 I would be very interested in knowing what the Energy Return over Energy Invested is for oil extracted via fracking. I understand that the earliest wells like Spindeltop had ERoEI of 150 or more. PO may come when the ERoEI gets too low.

7309 2018-11-06 11:40:21 They are actually in cahoots against the Iran-Syria axis, and it's oil based and territorial, but it's a very dangerous relationship. Israel is a lot smaller than Saudi Arabia, and they also have nuclear weapons. Netanyahu is not as smart as he thinks.

7317 2018-11-06 11:39:26 Where is the hatred in that statement? It was a legitimate question regarding Tharoor's response to comparable religious aspirations of various communities.India pays cold hard cash to OPEC nations for oil, and to US/Russia/Israel for any weapons purchases.Nobody does any favors.

7332 2018-11-06 11:36:56 But at what cost? Do you run a business to make your country kin suffer? Most of the people buying cooking oil at exhorbitant prices cant afford that. When will we realise as Zimbabweans that sometimes we are to blame and we should correct our own ways? Why kill each other?

7355 2018-11-06 11:34:29 U havent been paying attention. Because of the lack of tidewater pipeline capacity that is what we are getying for our oil now. Its called the bitumen bubble. Perhaps some thoughtful contemplation on ur part before you speak up.
7356 2018-11-06 11:34:25 I would be tempted to use some of the oil. One clove of garlic won’t do much. I’d use at least a bulb of roasted garlic with pumpkin as it tends to mellow a lot. If it’s already peeled I’d chop it and use it in the soup base rather than roasting.

But if it crashes that will hurt Putin.

Litvinenko warned West that Putin/Moscow are the masterminds behind global terrorism.

The world will fully realize that eventually.
7378 2018-11-06 11:32:11 So deep I see oil.

I would guess roast for 30 minutes and then check if the flesh is soft. It depends on how thick the pumpkin flesh is.

7689 2018-11-06 10:50:14 Seeds out and scrape off the stringy bits. I score and drizzle in oil and add pepper & dried herbs at the roasting stage too. They’re not grown for flavour so need all the help they can get.

7691 2018-11-06 10:50:09 สีสวยยย อยากได้ค่าา
7692 2018-11-06 10:49:47 What has been proved by all of this is the fallibility of referendums, that’s why we have representative government, it’s like hiring a mechanic then taking a poll on whether to change the oil or not
7693 2018-11-06 10:49:44 The more I see of slippery Hancock , the more he resembles an old style snake oil salesman ;  My advice ?   if you shake hands with him , count your fingers afterwards !

7698 2018-11-06 10:49:13 WHY DO ALL THESE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE THEY DUNKED THEMSELVES IN A WHOLE BARREL OF OIL BEFORE COMING
7699 2018-11-06 10:49:10 Eight countries, including China and India, that comprise #Iran's main #oil export markets have received 6-month waivers from reimposition of US #sanctions. What we do not know is how much oil they can buy, making it difficult to judge how fast sanctions will bite.
7700 2018-11-06 10:49:08 He also promised the same thing last year... Just saying.

7703 2018-11-06 10:49:07 -Make sure your skin is well moisturised before waxing (DO NOT apply a moisturiser right before waxing)

-press and rub the patch of skin immediately after waxing

-apply oil after waxing

-apply aloe Vera gel after waxing

7706 2018-11-06 10:48:33 Ie. barrier trade candidate before iran sanctions. Rumours are china will buy oil US on future, 24 billion annually instead from Iran.
7707 2018-11-06 10:48:29 Where does it say that this is what he was pointing out? Or are you putting your spin on it.

In any case, if what you say is true, then he is a blantant liar! Norway is rich not for being outside of the EU but because of Oil, CH because of banks. We have neither.....
7708 2018-11-06 10:48:24 I mean you could cook a meal from all the oil on his face so...

7716 2018-11-06 10:47:21 the oil oh no
7717 2018-11-06 10:47:07 If ~1.5M barrels/day on market legally, then still ~40% cut in (legal) Iranian supply. Administration knows that this could effect oil prices, hence sanction imposition the weekend before elections so that it doesn’t have time to hit the pumps?
7718 2018-11-06 10:47:06 It has become habit by Businesses to look for easy ways to Survive by Selling Oil, Coal & Gas eventhough it is Not Sustainable.. Such lazy minded approach has to be Changed with imbibing Innovation, R&D, Increasing Skilled Workforce in all sectors to make World Class Products..

7723 2018-11-06 10:46:40 Still Most of the businesses run by lazy businessmen don't do Innovation & dont invest in R&D or take Risk on Emerging Tech & keep shamelessly digging like Cave man in search of Unsustainable Coal, Oil & Gas thinking they can Survive like Govt Institutions without taking Risk..
7724 2018-11-06 10:46:38 There is unanimity among so called wizard of Indian Market that oil is only problem of Indian economy.. I think oil is one of the many.. concentration on one thing will result in missing big picture
7725 2018-11-06 10:46:36 Tatcha Water Cream (gah! So spendy, *so good*), Beauty Water, and jar after jar of pure argan oil (which I use as a general cleanser).
7726 2018-11-06 10:46:35 Joe says it's their country and they want it back. No place in it for you if you disagree.
A very good reason to keep them from getting it.
7727 2018-11-06 10:46:31 A Memorandum of Understanding is more like an agreement to investigate, it's not a contract at this point. Sounds like its a pre-study of a suggested venture. You'd have to think its a port, and I'd be thinking Westernport and export of gas/oil.

7735 2018-11-06 10:45:47 For one thing, many thought leaders on the right have already analyzed this issue and fully understand why PhDs tend to be progressive. Why isn't Lazarus, who is so well read, aware of these writings? I have an idea.
7736 2018-11-06 10:45:44 People live and vote with emotion not fact and logic. This is why it is so easy to manipulate the populace through media, marketing and a bit of showmanship. Snake Oil 2.0
7737 2018-11-06 10:45:33 The oil on his face is making me uncomfortable lmaoooo
7738 2018-11-06 10:45:32 We use oil for heating: If power prices were cheaper thanks to nuclear and renewables, Diesel or even gas would be uncompetitive against heat pumps. Same happens with hot water for human use.
7739 2018-11-06 10:45:32 Pour Your Oil

7746 2018-11-06 10:44:11 Japan, South Korea and other major oil importers welcomed Tuesday the decision by the Trump administration to let them continue to import Iranian crude oil and other petroleum products despite the re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran.

7754 2018-11-06 10:43:32 well gas might be. Oil, I doubt.
7755 2018-11-06 10:43:24 Remember Obama's friendliness with Saudi Arabia?  Actually, it turned out the Sauds can't even make the oil price drop anymore.   Saudi Arabia uniting the Arab world toward a two state solution? Dems have tried that too; forget it!! #resist the Dems' Middle East policy too!!

7761 2018-11-06 10:43:00 Traffic figures going in right direction, but CEO Bjørn Kjos @Fly_Norwegian said in latest statement: "However, we are now entering a period of lower demand, tough competition and high oil prices, making it even more important for the company to continue reducing its costs.”
7762 2018-11-06 10:42:57 I'm sure it'll play really well, but I just don't want to play "big oil" so the theme totally turns me off. Next time renewables please
7763 2018-11-06 10:42:49 Absolutely. Oil and gas companies know renewables will never threat their business, but baseload nuclear power, with such energy density and availability, is a whole different story. I wish there was some prove that Oil business is behind antinuclear campaigns!

7768 2018-11-06 10:41:28 Diesel fuel is heavier and less volatile than petrol, which makes it simpler to refine from crude oil. As a result, diesel tends to be cheaper than petrol in most countries around the world. Except the U.K. !

7816 2018-11-06 10:32:52 Keep paying to for Middle Eastern oil.  Some short sighted Luddites want to keep us dependent on it.
7817 2018-11-06 10:32:51 It’s proper the only problem is finding shades like caramel and true caramel. Otherwise, I’ve been happy, get the mattifying primer if you have oil skin cause it gives in after 4-5 hours.

And his yoke from your neck,
And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.

7839 2018-11-06 10:30:03 #PaulEDawson: Will climate change affect a family’s investment plans? 
Almost certainly. Losses from climate change could be large and permanent.
It's not just Stranded Oil & Coal
change is a systemic problem and... investors will struggle to avoid this risk.
7840 2018-11-06 10:29:59 It's so interesting to see the progress of an oil painting. And WHAT an oil painting! Incredible 
7841 2018-11-06 10:29:59 The materials science, production techniques, engineering, deployment etc. has taken a long time to improve, and we still don’t know what to do with all the batteries and turbine blades when those systems become obsolete. The big oil boogie man lines are meaningless.

7858 2018-11-06 10:28:09 As the Iran expert said yesterday, they’ll still sell loads of oil to Russia China & India. All they do is turn off the GPS on the oil tankers and the Yanks won’t know where they are 
7859 2018-11-06 10:28:08 Trump's fantasies will lead the west into a war with Iran. He's started with sanctions and if he gets his majority he won't be able to contain his narcissistic self from strutting around as Commander in Chief while he sends more american youngsters to die for oil.
7860 2018-11-06 10:28:01 Yet this is our Nation's Oil REGULATOR @dprhotline. Cant imagine the cost of opportunities lost, yet we window dress in the name of Local Content and helping native companies grow. This agency of Govt. should score a zero in the execution of the Executive Orders.

7866 2018-11-06 10:27:16 You aren’t looking at the bigger picture. This brand has harmed and even killed animals for YEARS testing toxic ingredients on them. This is a step and every step counts.

7872 2018-11-06 10:25:56 I've seen major oil companies make the same mistake, and it's not like they're short of cash or people. It's a combination of laziness, hubris, and incompetence.

Like the science paid for by oil companies. Or the catholic church. Or large corporations. 
Look for the profit motive, and you find people trying to get away with destroying the planet. 
Where does your "real science" come from?

I completely had no idea about "Cloud" until this week. I've discovered its potential as a great platform of commenting on #USOil for the proposed paid service. The users will be emailed the link and the users-only meeting will be held in the sky!
7973 2018-11-06 10:10:27 Celebrating an oil boom like Nigeria does something with it's oil or any Southern African country with their vast wealth of minerals. Zilch, Nada, nothing except benefiting Western multinationals, Western countries, bankers and a few stooges.

7977 2018-11-06 10:10:05 Every time you stroke a dog you get an average of 227 milligrams of natural oils on the palm of the hand ,which over an average of 12 strokes a session,4times a day adds up to 3.2gallons of oil a year. Enough to run a kfc restaurant for 2days
7978 2018-11-06 10:10:05 There needs to be no middle option. Devo Diddy. Either Tory Brexit with money from Scotland transferred to WM at higher levels than just subsidies Crown Estate & Crossrail consequentials. 
Or indy with higher pensions than UK from now via state oil fund & cancel UK oil tax deals.

7984 2018-11-06 10:09:33 Unfortunately there is a pricing guide... it is based on quality of the oil.
7985 2018-11-06 10:09:27 Such bullshit. Yeah, I see those free markets taking place in the Iran sanctions that exclude oil tycoons. Democracy my ass
7986 2018-11-06 10:09:25 the oil will soon run out. It's time to switch to blockchain. There is a good project Universa

7996 2018-11-06 10:08:35 What good does reimposing all sanctions on Iran do, when you let Iran continue to sell oil to its eight largest customers? You’re a paper tiger. It’s sad that your supporters are too blind to see that when it comes down to it, you are all talk, no action. Silver Spoon President.
7997 2018-11-06 10:08:29 U.S. state secretary vows fresh sanctions on Iran will see the country major decline in oil revenues to fund 'terrorism' #LeadingHeadLines
7998 2018-11-06 10:08:29 Sir(s),
Since crude oil price has been reduced in the International market (Re.1/- per litre subsidy) imposed to OMC should be withdrawn. If burden on OMC is lifted then investment market will boost up and will attract more foreign investments.

8006 2018-11-06 10:07:21 The 4% rule is largely a rule of thumb with respect to #oil and its pervasiveness throughout the economy. Sustained price spikes over 6 months in duration have a dramatic effect and as the saying goes everything you wear, everything you eat, everywhere you go requires oil. #OOTT

8011 2018-11-06 10:06:26 2 lac diyas × 10ml per diya =20 thousand liters oil and ghee to be burnt

8013 2018-11-06 10:06:09 I can see what your going for, but it’s not a good argument.

An electric car and a petrol car likely use about the same oil in production, but an electric car will use much less oil over a life of 200,000km

8022 2018-11-06 10:05:00 I'm so glad we bought a summer house a few years ago. It has a sauna. The preparation with chopping fire wood and carrying water from the well is itself relaxing. Then the bath, lit from oil lamps.

Already looking forward to the weekend bath ;-)
8023 2018-11-06 10:04:59 Good advice. I usually add a small bottle of fancy beard oil as well these days.

8048 2018-11-06 09:59:12 What baffles me is why Mobile pulled out, if the Muzarabani basin is that rich in oil and gas, given Mobile’s expertises and financial muscle? 
8049 2018-11-06 09:59:00 Petro$$ are on road to financial & cultural suicides. While oil replacement alternatives are falling in place, booming economies like India China are their last meal tickets.
No wonder they are 'Transfering' thr intellectually & culturally decadent populations to EU-UK-US-AUS

8070 2018-11-06 09:52:55 But the difference came at the midnight hour. The foolish ones though having the chance, did not take oil. The wise took oil. The wise were sensitized enough in the holy Spirit and thus were able to take oil. @martinssempa @mizzshelagh @Mutandahosea #PrepareTheWay

Do you know the price of crude oil during the past regime that still managed to sell petrol below 100?

If you want to back their claims get answers to those

8114 2018-11-06 09:46:33 Money is available and investors are interested.

The challenge is that, works ng in communal land, you are forced to do a feasibility study, which doesn’t cost less than R1m... investors need that report, value attacked to the oil, quality and signed off-take agreements

8124 2018-11-06 09:44:12 Very good point. The US fracking industry is based on an ever-growing mountain of debt. Sales of fracked gas and oil are insufficient to cover the cost of drilling more and more wells due to rapid depletion. When that bubble bursts we could see another financial meltdown.
8125 2018-11-06 09:44:07 Bio oil,lol
8126 2018-11-06 09:44:06 US wants to control all of the world’s oil supply to save the petro-dollar. Simple as that. Countries are dropping the $ like a hot rock because they’re tired of being bullied. US’ time has come. Illusion of exceptionalism at an end. #foxnews @foxnews #abc #cbs #cnn #msnbc

Normal heart rate without MCT oil 60

8166 2018-11-06 09:36:48 Public Register of Beneficial Owners of companies should be created to allow fraudulently acquired resources to be traced with ease, this will also aid in the removal of the opaqueness and secrecy hitherto associated with the oil sector

8184 2018-11-06 09:34:18 Oil price at N90 is a possible task for us as a nation.
What we need to do is to change from the current output cost subsidy to input cost subsidy as obtainable before OBJ regime,i.e.after resuscitating the refineries.
E.g.Selling crude oil at 60% discount to local refineries.
8185 2018-11-06 09:34:12 It's a smart way from the US administration to impose sanctions while not bringing oil prices through the roof
8186 2018-11-06 09:34:10 People of Gaza have put up with food shortages, limited cooking or heating oil for the upcoming winter, lack of hospitals & no medicine or certain diseases.

8234 2018-11-06 09:26:51 There's no state in this country that has no resources in it. We have paid too much attention to oil. If every Governor choose to be active rather than lazy, they will generate huge internal revenue enough to pay salaries. how much do you think can be made from tickets in parks?

8238 2018-11-06 09:26:33 US has allowed India, China and 6 other countries to temporarily keep buying Iranian crude oil despite sanctions against Tehran, calming fears of a possible jump in fuel prices.

8242 2018-11-06 09:25:59 Guinea in 2016 had about 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. For those who were saying President Mnangagwa visits poor countries what do you say now? Some people are good at criticizing only without proffering solutions.

Went back.
Bought some high grade fancy oil.
Motor purrs like a kitten.

8249 2018-11-06 09:24:51 Happy Deepavali everyone! Did you know? 2000 pounds of recycled paper can actually help to save 17 trees, over 350 gallons of oil, and a lot of landfill space. That also means less air pollution!
Save a tree this Deepavali!
8250 2018-11-06 09:24:47 Gotta laugh at uneducated d*mbass Trmpkin's screaming Ban all Muslims & Immigrants while they watch Saudi Muslim Oil Prince owned @FoxNews & cheer on our @POTUS who's married to an undocumented Immigrant.
 
The stupidity is staggering
8251 2018-11-06 09:24:30 Their oil imports source is quiet diversified most come from Persian gulf region but nation wise the biggest source is Russia.
8252 2018-11-06 09:24:26 Listening prophets of doom too much will make you to put you trust over stuff and you slowly cease to believe in God. When the salt or olieve oil runs out then you feel like you are not protected.

8254 2018-11-06 09:23:51 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 17,74 ευρώ με πτώση -3,06% και κεφαλαιοποίηση 1,97 δισ. ευρώ.
8255 2018-11-06 09:23:44 Do you believe that you can educate a people that want to control the price of crude oil at international market?
8256 2018-11-06 09:23:35 Some of us we move with "Johnson baby oil" in the pocket just in case we land on dry beans

8257 2018-11-06 09:23:15 If it also serves to keep the Saudis in order, can it serve both domestic and foreign policies? Not to mention China, how much do they need Iranian oil?
8258 2018-11-06 09:23:00 I am an oil painter I 100% do not understand how this is supposed to destress me there is no way I'm sticking my brushes anywhere near my ears 
8259 2018-11-06 09:22:52 Is about keeping the price of oil down as it will not be easy to supply the demand without Iran.
8260 2018-11-06 09:22:28 There is a big oil field under Gaza.

8263 2018-11-06 09:21:45 Haha. .oil prices will crash....lol
8264 2018-11-06 09:21:45 What happened to 100/barrel permabulls were forecasting? Just like that all just went back hiding in the caves. With oil prices...nobody can really predict future prices. Too many variables. With that said, I'll stick to my charts & trade it day by day.

8270 2018-11-06 09:20:17 @asda Love your own brand coffee whitener- one of few that is palm oil free. Don't love that it now comes in plastic not cardboard, and is 3x+ the price! Why?!
8271 2018-11-06 09:20:11 i found an entire gram of hash oil on the ground in the parking lot by my apartment today so that’s cute
8272 2018-11-06 09:20:01 Hi Lisa. Our bakes contain palm oil that is certified by #RSPO. There is currently no alternative ingredient. We are one of 3000 #RSPO members worldwide working together to develop & implement global standards for #sustainable palm oil.  Hope that answers your query.

8283 2018-11-06 09:18:21 Its an absolutely terrible idea, and completely agree.... how City and Arsenal think they are one of the European greats is beyond me..... city are nothing more than a club built on oil. Embarrassing!

8286 2018-11-06 09:17:39 Sure. Now you are trying to blame those fighting ISIS from your own crimes? Syrian Army  defeated ISIS in Syria. Iran backed Shia militias like PMU with Iraqi army defeated ISIS in Iraq. Meanwhile US, Israel & Saudis were supplying ISIS with weapons & buying cheap oil from them.

Another easy one is blitzing carrot, capsicum & onion in my mini food processor thing (or you could chop tiny), frying that off in a little oil & when softened, adding the red pesto and goats cheese/sour cream. Bulks it out a little, and the carrot adds some sweet.

8295 2018-11-06 09:16:46 depends what you mean by "people who disapprove" - could be pretty broad! I certainly know people who like geothermal but not shale oil/gas, but there are plenty of enviros who don't like solar or wind too, so I'm sure there are antis too...
8296 2018-11-06 09:16:46 Wonder how long it will be before we get a war in Iran and the US and it’s partners control the entire Arabian gulf, along with most of the worlds oil reserves?

8312 2018-11-06 09:13:26 Petrol retailers still ripping off  motorists at the pumps. 
The price of oil per barrel has now dropped around 15%
since the beginning of October. 
No price drops at the pumps.
Why no protests from motorists and the media?
8313 2018-11-06 09:13:26 Heard on radio ati some $5billion shani shani being signed with Angola. Wondering if I misheard, cos do we even import that much oil to make such deals viable. 
I know we should be forward thinking and such, but cash is tight
8314 2018-11-06 09:13:09 46% think they'll keep the oil, why? because it's theirs.
8315 2018-11-06 09:12:56 As a science student mix it with coconut oil and see magic
8316 2018-11-06 09:12:35 It's a pleasure  here have done it for health reasons. It has been replaced with sunflower and coconut oil (I looked at the products I have at home) I think you can find some articles about it.

And trading in USD?!? HAHA! Scam gila. Set up for easier manipulation.
8321 2018-11-06 09:11:54 True. We need to find alternative ways of making oil a second choice. We can’t be kept hostage like this!!

8345 2018-11-06 09:09:42 Agree, but while the incentives are introduced they are very costly to the taxpayer and oil the mechanism of greed and unnecessary jobs. This is exactly what's happening with EVs. To make matters worse most people buying these products are the wealthy. Not wealthy miss the boat.

8356 2018-11-06 09:07:46 Wait...so Government intervenes by absorbing the September fuel price increase. Then now with Rand appreciation and lower crude oil price,the public can’t benefit coz government wants to “recoup losses from the once off intervention”?

Why? Government budgets through the consumer.

8538 2018-11-06 08:40:42 You people that rub oil on your body and call it “skin glow” , what exactly is your problem?. Are you deceiving us your yourself?
8539 2018-11-06 08:40:42 Exactly! It’s like saying there’s this system it’s not us - but it is us millions of us! Who checks about palm oil in their products? Who caring that homeless orangutangs are being used in sex trade for beastiality  if it’s true awful depravity in world
8540 2018-11-06 08:40:41 Frankly if they didn’t have oil who would want to know them?

8547 2018-11-06 08:39:41 Why does  Ofgen persistently & totally ignore the needs of those of us not provided with gas & who have to rely on oil for heating?
8548 2018-11-06 08:39:39 HH the Amir : Qatar National Vision goals to achieve economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil and gas never mean, as I mentioned to you before, neglecting the oil and gas sector, the basic source of our wealth.

8549 2018-11-06 08:39:32 I empathize with the Oil Expressers. Culprits are the Wholesalers and Retailers. I flatly refused to be forced to purchase Grocery worth US$10 in order to purchase Cooking Oil. I told the Shop Manager that what he was doing was illegal. Greedy, Corrupt Wholesalers and Retailers!
8550 2018-11-06 08:39:30 Yes, indeed, Jim. Palm oil = ecological devastation.
8551 2018-11-06 08:39:29 @realDonaldTrump Yes, they will try to place on good light MBS. Aren't no one reason for you to defend MBS because that information about investigation will go public because of informators on your administration + America can gain from control of oil market and Middle East.

8557 2018-11-06 08:38:53 But today there is a deputation of SNP big guns, led by Mackay, visiting the plant and speaking platitudes.  Amazing how quick off the marks they are in their heartlands - no such treatment for Aberdeen during the oil crisis.

8570 2018-11-06 08:36:35 Ah is it the same as all those shit tankers that came out of hh that the fool would post to get his 10% spike 
8571 2018-11-06 08:36:09 Actually a few good tunes on there. Him listening to Midnight Oil is proper "Call Me Dave" Cameron listening to the Smiths, though. Feeling pretty smug about our ex-Laneways DJ PM and indie kid Finance Minister right now though.
8572 2018-11-06 08:36:07 1973 oil embargo convinced the dutch administration to provision cycling infrastructure over the coming decades. Nixons project independence didn’t go far. We have reached our inflection point with pollution & congestion, where we go depends on what we do.

8581 2018-11-06 08:34:12 I love a good candle being burned, while my essential oil vaporizer is going. It just smells cozy in here .
8582 2018-11-06 08:34:10 Sanction on Iran by US to export oil to other countries except China, India, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Italy & Greece would shrink Iranian oil export market by around 25 %. Its benefit would be reaped by other oil exporting countries due to maintenance or surge of oil prices.
8583 2018-11-06 08:34:05 Never seen it.
8584 2018-11-06 08:33:59 The #UnitedNations Security Council has authorised action against illicit oil exports from Libya for another six months and added planning and committing sexual and gender-based violence as reasons for sanctions, despite objections from Russia and China. TJM
8585 2018-11-06 08:33:55 We all know that palmful production is destroying the last Forrests but Thailand will start buying palm oil to make bio diesel in order to fetch higher and more stable prices for Southern people (and potential Prayuth voters)

8595 2018-11-06 08:32:16 Japan's top refiner, JXTG Holdings, considers resuming imports of Iranian crude oil after the nation received exemption from U.S. sanctions. The company temporarily paused imports of Iranian crude in October. #OOTT
8596 2018-11-06 08:31:57 Always keep in mind that to obtain the maximum therapeutic potential from cannabis to kill cancer cells, it must NOT be smoked but rather used as an extract or oil since that's how you really pull all the healing powers out of this amazing plant.
8597 2018-11-06 08:31:51 Bobani & Manyati also breathes the same air. CONspiracy mongering. Selling snake oil to the simple-minded. If Bobani is guilty, he must go to jail.

8940 2018-11-06 07:37:36 Lol! That list is nearly the same as the waivers list!

Again, this is why the price of oil has collapsed over the past few weeks.

So after Trump blew up the Iran nuke deal, Iran gets to:
1) Build nukes
2) Keep the money we returned
3) Sell it's oil.

USA gets NOTHING. Ugh.

8948 2018-11-06 07:35:15 Olives are pressed to get oil,
Fruits are squeezed for juice,
Flowers are crushed for perfume,

These are the methods used to get goodness out of things,

So whenever you feel crushed, squeezed or pressed, it means ALLAH is trying to get the best out of you......

8962 2018-11-06 07:32:18 Baby oil is also good. Smells better as well.
8963 2018-11-06 07:32:12 Truth. For posterity/lurkers (ie, not saying I don't think u know this): beeswax is key for it to cool as a solid. You can melt it in a rather larger amount of pretty much any oil (olive oil or coconut oil also nice). Adjust ratio to yr preferred texture. Everything else is gravy
8964 2018-11-06 07:31:57 But wait oo, all of you criticising @atiku , don't you have anything to say about @PeterGregoryObi? At least if we no because of yam chop red oil, we go because of red oil chop yam. That man is enough reason to vote Atiku for *me.

9009 2018-11-06 07:22:16 Yes. Harvested enough small roots (my soil is poor, sandy and dry) for one meal last year. Pan fried in a touch of oil. Flavour a little like a mild parsnip, hint of woody bitterness, crunchy like a raw potato even when cooked.

9066 2018-11-06 07:14:17 Oil prices fell on Tuesday, weighed down by sanction exemptions from Washington that will allow Iran's biggest oil customers to keep importing from Tehran, as well as by concerns that an economic slowdown may curb fuel demand growth.
9067 2018-11-06 07:14:17 Iran's oil exports have fallen sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump said at mid-year he would re-impose sanctions on Tehran, but with waivers in hand, the Middle Eastern nation's major buyers could scale up orders as soon as next month.

Economics is macro sir and your focus seems to be micro. Ask Moyane about a R50b tax shortfall in 1 yr.
9081 2018-11-06 07:10:57 My grandma tried to make me go for prayer in church like 2 weeks ago. Like deadass. The pastor was up there with a whole bottle of olive oil putting crosses on everybody foreheads. I told her I couldn’t go because my eyebrows would’ve came off

9086 2018-11-06 07:10:11 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
9087 2018-11-06 07:09:58 Wow, so Andorra, Liechtenstein and San Marino can‘t import Iranian oil anymore. Those sanctions are really going to do the job.
9088 2018-11-06 07:09:52 Searing hot oil just jumped into my eye. How is your night going?
9089 2018-11-06 07:09:50 AWWWW! Who is this little floofer? i hope their procedure goes super smoothly, painlessly & is as stress free as possible

9093 2018-11-06 07:09:10 Wow, those are really tough sanctions. Now Andorra, San Marino and Liechtenstein can‘t import Iranian oil anymore. That‘s definitely going to bring the regime down.
9094 2018-11-06 07:09:06 If you had £40m you could buy far more Acrage than Angus own. not to mention the premium that shareholders would want. 
I'm sure Angus could sell a percentage of Brockham to  @DavidLenigas for £2m, If the share holders vote no.
9095 2018-11-06 07:08:42 I’ve been mixing both recipes, reason being for the colour aspect

9100 2018-11-06 07:08:16 He deserves credit for it.  He built it back from GWBush destruction of the US Economy by allowing his oil cronies 21Trillion$ to off shore accts. Tanking the government.  Enough of trickle down bs. Gawd you’re a witch.
9101 2018-11-06 07:08:08 Your only about 6 months away lol.  Get some good quality beard oil, a nice brush, and itll be a breeze to get there!
9102 2018-11-06 07:07:40 Neymar's pursuit is nothing but a wild goose chase. No way anyone can make that state-sponsored oil mafia sell a player against its will, not even the player himself. Also, they have some big cash-making plans from the Qatar World Cup the key to which is Neymar's presence at PSG.
9103 2018-11-06 07:06:43 Oil down $14 a barrel in the past few weeks. We should be paying around £1.27- £1.29 ppl for petrol if you are not fill up somewhere else!

your lashes ))

9218 2018-11-06 06:46:25 I want to agree but Nigeria problem is also multi faced. Minimum wage that wasn’t discussed (let alone increased) when crude oil sold above $100 / barrel, rather it was Naira rainfall for few moneybags.

9225 2018-11-06 06:45:15 So Sharon, Let's talk about Venezuela. Do you know why it didn't work there? 98% of their GDP was oil and oil prices were slashed. Why don't we talk about the things in this country that are socialist, the cops, the FBI, the fire department, public schools, roads, libraries...….

for a bit of fun I've added a 2a. step of chia seed oil serum.

Oil Prices Fall As US Plans Gradual Sanctions Against Iran.
AUD/USD:- keeps 0.7200 post-RBA inaction.
GBP/USD:- looking to hold onto 1.3050 ahead of Tuesday's politics-heavy news flow.
EUR/USD:- frozen ahead of the US midterm elections.
9232 2018-11-06 06:44:02 Remember how natives are losing the right to vote and their land is getting taken away and ruined for oil pipelines?

If you're really that concerned about real world affects of racism, actually address things going on in the real world instead of complaining about a video game.

Osun has gold that is currently being mined illegally as the FG is concentrated on cheap oil money from Niger Delta.

And have you been to Ekiti? Tourism should make them the richest South West State.

9240 2018-11-06 06:43:33 Simply put, we can’t afford it. The FG had to borrow to pay wages last year as our crude oil revenue couldn’t cover it(1st time this has happened in 30+ years).

9262 2018-11-06 06:40:55 Yes our senators are overpaid, but there are 109 senators. How large is the workforce of the Nigerian Civil Service? You’re asking for a 60% increase at all wage levels at a time where we aren’t able to pay wages exclusively from oil revenue for the 1st time since I was born.

9298 2018-11-06 06:35:54 Right. I can maybe empathize with the poor saps who buy the snake oil, but to buy it and then proudly advertise it?!?! Ice-King level pathos here.
9299 2018-11-06 06:35:49 Can't wait for oil prices to crash in 2019. Unfortunately the same does not usually apply in Kenya, but 80-90 shillings for a litre is ideal.

9313 2018-11-06 06:34:03 well, the oil will fluctuate but the services deficit is driven by tourism which will only increase as incomes rise

9345 2018-11-06 06:30:05 So did the rest of the oil companies - you have something against oil companies changing their ways to be more green?
9346 2018-11-06 06:29:52 Eyah...na palm oil steeeeew!!
9347 2018-11-06 06:29:41 So record unemployment, 3% wage growth, stability on the Korean Peninsula, two bills passed to lower prescription costs, economy growing at 3.5% every quarter, US largest producer of Oil worldwide, ocean clean up bill passed, human trafficking being adressed... you want more???

9351 2018-11-06 06:29:05 Insuring a rogue state asset is difficult. India has a waiver on oil imports from Iran, but Iran will insure its own ships because no insurance is available due to sanctions.

9353 2018-11-06 06:28:48 border towns were devised during the colonial era safeguard SA captive markets. We will provide them with water but they will sell us their manufactures-with Zim failing to produce enough cooking oil, we are damned if Messina successfully industrialize.
9354 2018-11-06 06:28:47 Vous vous trompez ! Aujourd’hui à entendre la presse il y a plus important.... les gilets jaunes et les 6 centimes d’augmentation du Gas oil ! Qu’est ce que vous venez perturber le populisme ambiant avec votre grand père et les millions de ses semblables !!!! Pauvre France !
9355 2018-11-06 06:28:29 That's to educated and insightful for the pawns of this used car snake oil salesman we call a President. As they say you hire a clown, you get a circus and the Repubs all have front row seats. The bigtop tent is about to cave in on all of them...
9356 2018-11-06 06:28:12 I like using olive oil on my scalp and hair if I’m doing a natural hairstyle and shea moisture products.
9357 2018-11-06 06:27:58 Afza normal to oily hm tak sesuai lah ngn afza. Oil cleanser afza pakai biore tu lagi. Mcm mcm nak beli sebenarnya sbb tgh ada duit tapi bila fikir balik, taknak membazir. Nanti dah takde duit, nak repurchase mula lah.
9358 2018-11-06 06:27:58 Here is an example of how we can work together...

Texas based company requested 400kg of Rose Geranium Oils... industry role players in SA can’t even reach 10% combined.

Had it been allowed for blacks to participate long ago, we would be close to Rwanda oil supply.

9364 2018-11-06 06:26:59 1 in NL and other MS public service pay is linked to market sector . Oil price? 2 there is big difference between some role analysis and the determining role in your propsal. 3 an expenditure rule with adjustment for discr income measures is not far from struc budget balance rule
9365 2018-11-06 06:26:58 Leadership,talks about harnessing our resources incl HR and max their potential.Our  noise abt sanctions should be at the same pitch with the one we a spsd to make on corruption.These 2 cannot be separated,otherwise we kp  plundering the little oil God has given us.#leadersrise

This is pouring salt on my wound, and then pouring hot oil and then poking it using an iron rod.

9376 2018-11-06 06:24:45 lmao.... Why did Obama say those jobs were never coming back? Why did Obama say Trump would need some sort of magic wand to bring back 1M jobs? you fucking liars! Cutting regulations, Tax cuts & becoming the #1 exporter in Oil is what has created Economic Growth!
9377 2018-11-06 06:24:45 Like seriously hey. As if we’ll do bad or be in a worst position without his baby oil ass!
9378 2018-11-06 06:24:37 The answer is always coconut oil
9379 2018-11-06 06:24:37 That crossing arm needs some oil or something.
9380 2018-11-06 06:24:17 Winter is an etching, spring a watercolor, summer an oil painting and autumn a mosaic of them all.
9381 2018-11-06 06:24:15 OYO for both Kenyatta and you bros 
9382 2018-11-06 06:24:08 Hmm  When do you start? Eat healthily whilst you’re at it. Cut out all carbs and only eat healthy fats like olive oil and coconut oil.
9383 2018-11-06 06:23:57 Seems pretty telling it's mostly oil and coal companies funding the no campaign
9384 2018-11-06 06:23:34 2 Kings 4:2 - And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.
9385 2018-11-06 06:23:24 I am prepared to trade the drums full of reclaimed cooking oil for the millions of crickets in a towed school bus as agreed.
9386 2018-11-06 06:23:20 We are still looking at Oil and Gas.

9389 2018-11-06 06:22:51 @FriendsOScience is literally a think-tank paid for by oil/gas investors. Their "climate scientists" are actually geologists and engineers for oil/gas companies. Again, go back to school if you really cannot do a simply background check on your sources. #cdnpoli
9390 2018-11-06 06:22:50 It doesn't help for me working around a lot of Open Flame and cooking food on a regular basis and if I'm near a fryer for more than 5 minutes it's game over. it's like my face seeks out oil molecules in the air!

9392 2018-11-06 06:22:41 Does the phrase “snake oil salesman” ring any bells?
9393 2018-11-06 06:22:35 Louder.
9394 2018-11-06 06:22:31 Do you still use palm oil in your products though?

9396 2018-11-06 06:22:27 That's our problem o.
Am sure even you can do better and make more money without looking at Nigeria's oil and gas. 

Many are billionaires today without a drop of crude oil into any vessel for export or refinement. 

Forget oil and gas brother.
Without oil Nigeria will survive.
9397 2018-11-06 06:22:21 As Iranian oil is blocked from global markets by #RealDonaldFuckingTrump his absurd sanctions will escalate the retail cost of gasoline.

#Trump removed the USA from Obama's/ @POTUS44 #IranianNuclearAgreement strictly to impress his #DeplorableBase.    #Reprehensible

9399 2018-11-06 06:22:07 Eskomnwas paying Glencore R180 a ton of coal and wanted R240 as they could not turn a profit (This price had been in place for over 10 years? Eskom forces Glencore to Give Guptas the deposit to buy the mine then pays Guptas R680/ton??? Glencore then buys SA oil reserve for $28 /2

9412 2018-11-06 06:19:52 Is it 20%? Ignoring the etoll issue, I have no problem with foreign investors. Many JSE listed companies have foreign shareholders. eg Standard Bank is 20.1% owned by the Commercial and Industrial Bank of China.  More than 20% of the petrol price is used to pay for crude oil.
9413 2018-11-06 06:19:41 That anointing oil has results dear.
9414 2018-11-06 06:19:34 The USA position under Trump's regime on Iran has no basis in international law or equity it is about appeasing the obscenely wealthy Israeli lobby n the USA who have captured him/family & Saudi oil. As a keen student of Iran with direct contacts there Trump's strategy won't work

9426 2018-11-06 06:16:42 None whatsoever!  Make no mistake about it!

They are snake oil salesmen and will siphon as much off as they can to line their own pockets!
9427 2018-11-06 06:16:32 He's right..A house divided against itself cannot and will not stand-Whether you're right or left, (D) or (R), there must be unity & agreement, not ONE speck of division..You must have allies supporting you, not enemies-Otherwise, it's like oil & water-They will NOT mix..

9433 2018-11-06 06:15:26 A $10.00 per barrel tax on oil would devastate Texans. Pain-capable abortions are evil. Abolishing ICE is plain crazy. Banning AR-15's is unconstitutional. Telling black people cops are "the new Jim Crow" is reprehensible. Sanctuary cities = anarchy. Sorry. Not voting for that.
9434 2018-11-06 06:15:21 Bla Antony iam as excited as you but Mzarabani is my home area ,this is not a new discovery,Oil was discovered in the early 90s by Mobile and wether you are ZANU PF or MDC we are Zimbabweans!!!

9438 2018-11-06 06:14:49 Hi there,

You better remove the "SANCHI" or " SANCHI (f.k.a. GARDENIA; f.k.a. SEAHORSE; f.k.a. SEPID) (T2EF4) Crude Oil Tanker 164,154DWT 85,462GRT" from your OFAC list

9441 2018-11-06 06:14:37 Try this: sautee chopped onions & celery in olive oil, add thinly sliced summer squash & zucchini, continue to sautee until sq&z are, basically, al dente.  Season to taste (s&p, a little garlic salt, smoked paprika - you get the idea) & snarf.
9442 2018-11-06 06:14:27 You should also base it on your skin type. Different products are suitable for someone with dry, combination or oily skin. But essentials are low PH cleanser (oil based make up remover first if you use make up), tonic and emulsion or cream/night cream.And suncream ofc every day.

9447 2018-11-06 06:14:03 Where I find it gets trickier is when you’re toasting rice in oil first, cooking it in a casserole dish, etc. — also if you like Japanese rice, you have to watch out for the 新米 (new crop) sticker, that makes it wetter so you reduce water, etc.

9453 2018-11-06 06:13:12 Actually it was quite westernized before the US/CIA overthrew the country bc they/ Great Brit. didn’t like Iran reclaiming the oil from their country. Imposed a dictator, which previous revolution overthrew with religious leaders. Simple blowback.  CIA pattern for following yrs.

9475 2018-11-06 06:08:46 There is no basis for making the assertion in #6. Refining feedstock decisions are made by *refiners* depending on their refining capacity and profit opportunities. As Irving noted several years ago, it would not necessarily accept EE oil.

9478 2018-11-06 06:08:20 I dunno.  Tribalism in America is so bad right now that it’s hilarious to me that an entire political party that thinks nothing about grifting each other out of thousands via snake oil scams for “brain fuel” and actual shit is rabidly angered when it happens to them from outside.

9485 2018-11-06 06:07:20 And no yearly & costly garage visits for oil change, breaks change, filter change, engine maintenance,...

9507 2018-11-06 06:02:29 Agreed. The oil industry has carried out a fraud on humanity. They knew that carbon would endanger humanity but refused to tell, just like mass murderers in tobacco. #ExtinctionRebellion Nov17th
9508 2018-11-06 06:02:09 The USA has committed many war crimes. Using white phosphorus on civilians  numerous times in Syria. Evacuating terrorists to safety, illegally bombing and occupying Syria etc. You want to bomb Iran for its oil. Hypocrisy at its worst..
Get OUT out of the Middle East.

9523 2018-11-06 06:00:23 Going after Iran’s oil money will hit Tehran where it hurts, but it also means hitting a major pillar of the global oil market — Iran is the Opec cartel’s third-largest producer — with major consequences for world supply.

9535 2018-11-06 05:58:30 Can't use strategic oils reserves - we don't have enough and they are just for emergency. Can't use USD - forex will fall. Only way out is to urgently push renewables and biofuels on war mode and have better relations with other oil producing / OPEC members.

9576 2018-11-06 05:49:26 Those amount to HUGE amounts of oil. Plus some folks will "launder" Iranian oil through those countries. 

Those waivers swallow up the sanctions rendering them useless.  That's why the price of oil collapsed in the past 2 weeks.

9600 2018-11-06 05:45:46 There are many more factors like in the 1980s soon after the Iran Oil Crisis the US signed a deal with Saudi Arabia so they had more than enough oil coming frm a country with close proximity to Europe & US so there was not need to exploit a field far away at the tip of Africa.

9605 2018-11-06 05:45:04 Hello @MayaKadosh. I wanted to ask a serious question of how Israel is taking India’s decision to keep importing oil from Iran? Thinking among common people is that Israel is more important ally than Iran but due to some limitations we would continue the imports. Why do u think?

9667 2018-11-06 05:36:10 A great socialist achievement. In 1998, 50% of taxes were non-hydrocarbon or mining related and 30% of exports were non-hydrocarbon related.

After 29 years of wonderful socialism 96% of the country's income is oil.

9689 2018-11-06 05:32:13 Yes, and they then try to export them across the East African Community fraudulently as community-manufactured goods. The rest of us need to tighten up inspections to prevent such cheating which concerns a very wide range of products, including edible oil and other foodstuffs.
9690 2018-11-06 05:31:57 While it is good to focus on development as a long term plan, right now, and with the current situation, looking into where we can buy cheaper oil products is still a good option.

9698 2018-11-06 05:31:05 How is it the existing shipping traffic takes precedent over additional tanker traffic? If the concern is shipping traffic, shouldn’t all ships be restricted, as opposed to singling out Alberta oil tankers? You can guess if BC produced oil, it would be on the sea heading east!
9699 2018-11-06 05:30:57 One of the reasons I actually check my oil and coolant and always run to buy fuel when it’s like halfway is because I don’t want my car to daku on 3MB at night or any time at all lmao

9777 2018-11-06 05:20:02 It always will Texas is huge and powerful no matter the party being more progressive it will be closer to getting into the Cannabis market that is profiting billions a year we’re missing out on. Oil is very important for Texas but the barrel is no where near the $100 highs
9778 2018-11-06 05:19:48 Mr common sense, stop using twitter unless you have a reloaded sense. Govt finally agrees,  don't we get grants from other countries?  What happened to the money you borrowed during oil boom and the depleted foreign reserves during GEJ reign?

9793 2018-11-06 05:17:20 Yep, that's the lazy option. Flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of olive oil and the rolling pin. Straight to the pan, real nice.
9794 2018-11-06 05:17:20 Arab leadership and despots are to blame for the situation in Gaza. Billions in oil money and peace with Israel could bring prosperity to Gaza but the Arab leadership are blind to their plight.

9832 2018-11-06 05:10:08 How is trade related to sovereignty? What is your point? Iran produces & exports more oil than USA. The decision of whether or not to import oil from USA/Iran is a sovereign matter for each country (ideally)
9833 2018-11-06 05:10:07 GDFB billionaires who want to pollute our environment to enrich themselves & their coal, oil and gas properties. So they got Trump &his minions in & they're going2town ruining our country's waters&lands. Thank the KOCHs4the pollution of America. I spit on them.
9834 2018-11-06 05:10:02 680 mln barrels which we will not gain anything from i would rather its never mined until we become accountable. Look ar Uganda just a sniff if oil and their economy has grown and their infrastructure is now better

9840 2018-11-06 05:09:26 Yes, something called ‘mayil-enna’ (literally translated as ‘peacock oil’) which claims to strengthen human hair is also becoming quite popular around the Attappadi forest range of Kerala-Tamilnadu border, towards the Kerala side. A 500ml bottle is charged around 700-800 ₹.
9841 2018-11-06 05:09:24 Iran
As quid pro quo for providing US air corridor and road access to Afghanistan, Pakistan should also be exempt from US sanctions for trade with Iran.  Unofficial import of oil should be regulated and NOT checked.

9849 2018-11-06 05:08:46 Yeah you just want to be gentle removing your makeup around your eye and use an oil free cleanser/ remover because oils can break down the glue used to bond the extensions to the natural lash.

9862 2018-11-06 05:06:27 I love when we all pretend that politicians impact the economy. when it went down under the UCP they find some other reason after taking full credit for increases. Haha the NDP and UCP do not control global oil prices. And the price differential is a federally caused issue.
9863 2018-11-06 05:06:26 I bought this essential oil that’s supposed to make you sleepy. I’ve used it two nights in a row and it’s making me wide awake instead 
9864 2018-11-06 05:06:25 I would have to say primarily is the economy. Our province won’t go anywhere without supporting our key industries (oil & gas)
Then education, what the NDP is doing with the new curriculum is frightening. Re-writing it behind closed doors while baking in their ideology to it.

9896 2018-11-06 05:01:39 Donald Trump . . . Superhero, or Chump?
Not a Hollywood actor, nor a Baron of oil
He’s a towering inferno built from Homeland-soil
His footings shallow; his heart on his sleeve
He’ll make “America Great”, if that’s what you believe
Or is Trump just so different
9897 2018-11-06 05:01:24 i just tried to make a grilled cheese with oil and it was bare far the nastiest thing I’ve ever had — its time to hit the grocery store

9904 2018-11-06 05:00:16 This is very sad to see as Sri Lankan. UNP couldn’t fix the economy due to heavy loan repayments and other costs. Will there be another treasuries bond issue? Hope unlike the previous one. Now this burden will pass onto innocent people. I hope the oil we discovered will rescue us

9910 2018-11-06 04:59:29 When King David was anointed with the oil by Shmuel HaNavi it would still be a while before he would sit on the thrown as king. Be patient. You may already be crowned with a blessing but it may take time to actualize.

9918 2018-11-06 04:58:39  organic coconut oil everytime you wash... just that one time lmao! or use the coconut hair mist, you can use that everyday.

9935 2018-11-06 04:56:12 Your right about oil man part. He's unbelievable at making money. That's why he should just be the "owner".
9936 2018-11-06 04:56:03 It's good to know that Canada under PET Sr. was an 'Island onto itself' & void of any untoward influences we see today, like a 50% cut the world oil price & US bank rates climbing in response to Trump's $1.5 Trillion tax give away. So glad we don't have to compete with them

9943 2018-11-06 04:54:43 Ugh, still being haunted by the disgusting, greasy crab cake I had for dinner. Crab cakes should always be broiled, never fried, but if they are fried, the damn oil needs to be hot as fuck.

9945 2018-11-06 04:54:39 Add oil, last two days, 2000 words,

9946 2018-11-06 04:54:35 As quid pro quo for providing US air corridor and road access to Afghanistan, Pakistan should also be exempt from US sanctions for trade with Iran.  Unofficial import of oil should be regulated and NOT checked.
9947 2018-11-06 04:54:29 I finally ordered my CBD oil I can’t wait for it to come in!
9948 2018-11-06 04:54:14 And we have 184,000 people out of work. Considering the NDP take that measurement from the very bottom of the recession anyone would have growth. 6 straight months of job losses, $15 dollar oil heavy and light. It’s a god dam disaster.
9949 2018-11-06 04:53:23 I thought you're a self-confessed capitalist - I'm no expert when it comes to social labels but I thought capitalism and socialism are like oil and water?   
9950 2018-11-06 04:53:03 Finally bought some oil 
9951 2018-11-06 04:53:03 Legit rich? Wrong notion, legit thieves you mean? The banker billionaire, the billionaire industrialist smugglers, the politician emperor, the military general oil magnate, the 'coupist'billionaire' , the civil servant billionaire, billionaire ex-police chief, ...
9952 2018-11-06 04:52:56 #iran sanctions all political games? #Trump has already shown signs of weakness: he granted a temporary sanctions waiver to eight countries, including Russia, China, Turkey, Japan, India and South Korea. #oil is not in shortage given demand. #oott $wti $bno
9953 2018-11-06 04:52:46 #AMLiveNTV, Jakoyo is a follower just as @KBonimtetezi is a leader. Explained by miscibility of water and oil.
9954 2018-11-06 04:52:44 Trade wars could stall global growth. Sink oil price. Kill growth
9955 2018-11-06 04:52:34 I actually vote for some Republican issues in California elections. National Republicans haven't been good for a long time. Balance our budget and we'll talk. Stop selling out for war & oil. You've been in charge for a while now.

9963 2018-11-06 04:51:26 The larger companies all have spill response teams and they are continually practicing and partaking in training for both land and water and oil companies work together on spills. Every oil company must have an emergency response plan.
9964 2018-11-06 04:51:05 Does anyone else fear for their life when the chorizo starts crackling oil? Yes I’m cooking chorizo for dinner. Don’t worry about it. 
9965 2018-11-06 04:50:58 Every competent human on this planet should know how to change a tire and change your oil
9966 2018-11-06 04:50:38 @NAH_208 ASA!  Need to control Waste Generation in UAE. UAE also ranking high in waste generation Reduce,Reuse,Recycle culture lacks in UAE. Due to rich in oil and gas Energy conservation not an important issue in UAE. Climate Change,Global Warming! We have to Act Now!
9967 2018-11-06 04:50:31 Fixed:
Under #ProportionalRepresentation, we would be much more likely to elect governments that reflect voters' views on protecting the family, genuinely sustainable small business practices, resource sector growth and oil pipelines.

9968 2018-11-06 04:50:08 Open a line to report such. The people you supply take this to the black market. Your cooking oil is sold at 5th ave market. At crazy prices

9972 2018-11-06 04:49:21 Better than the discs of oil y’all eat 
9973 2018-11-06 04:49:19 Correct! But we must address this business weakness of trying to get rich quickly. Why are we charging $18 for a bottle of cooking oil? Kuurayana pachedu!
9974 2018-11-06 04:49:10 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
9975 2018-11-06 04:48:34 A necessary commentary to encourage voting.  Sadly for many whose vote is guided by subjective sentimentalism,. questionable, unrealistic idealism, or loyalty to a party because they have accepted the snake oil, voting is worse than "taken for granted", it is stupid and dangerous
9976 2018-11-06 04:48:30 Enjoy your oil.
9977 2018-11-06 04:48:06 IT'S TIME TO OIL UP

9981 2018-11-06 04:47:23 War for profits! That is the real meaning of all war, profit, money, military contracts, oil, resources, control.

9987 2018-11-06 04:46:39 And you're dead wrong on the Liberals too. They've governed from the right since 2015. Adopted Harper's policies on carbon emission targets, Saudi weapons deal, corporate tax cuts, nuclear ban, TPP, oil pipelines and even went to the right of the CPC by doubling military spending
9988 2018-11-06 04:46:29 I might switch to just using argan and jojoba oil instead of a moisturizer

10002 2018-11-06 04:45:10 That's the problem.  This is hype and rhetoric.  Worse, it's a con artist selling you his snake oil.  Your decisions now will haunt your future.

Trump's not a visionair though -he's dreaming about a wall and a space force- and his buddies are into oil and gas, so who's gonna tell him?
Nobody.
