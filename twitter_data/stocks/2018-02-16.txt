8 2018-02-18 23:58:15 Amy, we are not going to take away your gun. We want to take away bump stocks, ar15’s automatic rifles and guns that are made for the military, and we want to take away guns from convicts, the mentally ill, and from the domestic abusers. Common sense.

36 2018-02-18 23:49:18 BULLSHIT! No one needs assault rifles, high capacity magazines, or bump stocks.  Cut the crap. If each point of gun control spares one shooting, is it not worth it? Stop blaming the victims. #BanAssaultWeapons
37 2018-02-18 23:48:36 Universal background checks that exclude people on mental health registry (who gets on/off specifically set out), outlaw bump stocks & other ways of increasing number of rounds fired/sec, limit size of mags. I also prefer no online/gun show sales, but prob cannot happen.

39 2018-02-18 23:46:12 They don't got curry stocks where you're at?
40 2018-02-18 23:46:11 I agree, and an anonymous person also invested 400 mil on bitcoin the other day. He could have invested in very successful stocks such as apple or amazon, but he chose bitcoin. Crypto is no joke
41 2018-02-18 23:45:43 Feel like we’re actually in front of the net this game, but none of our net front opportunities have actually turned into shots—a bunch of fumbled pucks and failures to get stocks turned
42 2018-02-18 23:45:41 Sure, not an automatic weapon. It is a semi-automatic weapon though that can be modified with bump stocks to function like an automatic weapon. Has an RPM of about 400. Also was first used in Vietnam so it is a weapon of war. Do we really need access to these?
43 2018-02-18 23:43:14 Doesn't matter. Dr. "green" is up to her eyeballs in oil stocks. And what happened to all that money she collected for the recounts but didn't spend on recounts. 
She has been making a living unsuccessfully running for president. In other words- just another grifter.
44 2018-02-18 23:42:30 Ideas: Improve K-12 school security. Educate teachers, parents, MD's. Improve mental health services. Ban sale of guns/rifles to anyone <21. Ban unlicensed gun dealers. Have a 2-day minimum waiting period. Improve background checks. Ban bump stocks. Fire Obama holdovers at FBI.
45 2018-02-18 23:42:08 I agree that bump stocks shouldn't be legal. Anything that makes a semi-auto a full-auto, shouldn't be legal. Cruz didn't have a bump fire stock.
46 2018-02-18 23:40:17 You want to know what "solving phantom problems" looks like? Banning vertical foregrips and telescoping stocks.
47 2018-02-18 23:40:17 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
48 2018-02-18 23:39:59 Exactly ...they feel it’s the beginning of taking away their rights. Not at all, just the same  of semi and automatic hand guns and rifles.  It amazes me after the Vegas shooting nothing was done to take away the sale of bunt stocks! We have to make changes when we vote in Nov.
49 2018-02-18 23:39:48 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
50 2018-02-18 23:34:30 True. I’m not arguing for assault weapons, silencers or bump stocks. I do know we will have to have stronger laws & don’t feel sorry for folks complaining it puts a “burden” on responsible gun owners. If they are truly responsible they shouldn’t mind better laws.

53 2018-02-18 23:33:22 NOT JUST BUMP STOCKS. ALL WEAPONS, THAT CAN BE USED FOR A NON HUNTING OR SELF DEFENSE MEASURE. BAN THEM ALL. In Gun store Manuals down south, they HAVE BARRELL DRUMS OF AMMO FOR SUB MACHINE GUNS. BAN ALL PARTS of Machine Guns, and Ammunition for them.

56 2018-02-18 23:32:17 Why hasn't the NRA allowed congress to pass Federal background checks and ban bump stocks? Both are supported by a majority of Americans! Also, the NRA loves mass shootings because they increase their profits. Don't pretend they care about the innocent dead
57 2018-02-18 23:30:28 Don't come for me lol. That movie paid off my student debt, got me a Lamborghini, and secured me a million dollars in stocks
58 2018-02-18 23:29:37 6. 'Bump sticks'...we believe you may mean bump stocks are in current legislation, but are easily fabricated. Criminals don't care.
59 2018-02-18 23:29:14 $WPL & $BHP are the two main weights on the Aussie market Monday morning. Combined they're wiping out ~12pts from the #ASX 200. Not including both stocks, the index would be up close to 0.2% #ausbiz
60 2018-02-18 23:28:09 What does that have to do with change? Fact remains that for a long time those teams were laughing stocks. Franchises and dynasties rise and fall.
61 2018-02-18 23:27:14 Does former CIA director James Woolsey have stocks in alternative fuels? He just keeps repeating same simplistic mantra about eddy if cost of oil.  He answers no questions @cnn or he has had a stroke
62 2018-02-18 23:26:45 @RollyTrader Hey Rolly, you say on your interview you go through 4000 charts a day. I'm setting up Prorealtime with all 2250 stocks in 50 batches. And a couple of screeners. Wouldn't this be the most efficient way of scanning (scrolling down through the lot)?
63 2018-02-18 23:25:59 The only thing the @NRA supports is #thoughtsandprayers. #NRA mocks us by fighting commonsense laws such as universal background checks, no assault weapons, no bump stocks, restrictions for those w/mental health diagnosis, and no fly-no buy. #CommonSenseGunLaws

65 2018-02-18 23:25:49 It appears that these kids are actually promoting this themselves. So, where are the kids who want to promote guns? Have not seen them. They aren't going to wait for adults to fix it. A child with mental issues got an assault weapon. +Congress still hasn't outlawed bump stocks?
66 2018-02-18 23:24:33 I’m so glad Gabe got this job. He wants to buy a home, get us a new car, and invest more money in the stocks. I’m so proud of the man he’s becoming 
67 2018-02-18 23:22:36 —two different issues.  No bump stocks, no high capacity magazines, 6 months waiting period, 3 months required training. Now!
68 2018-02-18 23:20:26 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi U guys will not LOOK in2 auto/semi-auto guns & B stocks! Our kids R coming after U. & when they're done $ will be OUT of politics-so will NRA/AND ANY Pol who won't vote 2 ban! Start saving UR NRA$ Ryan-McC, U won't get much more
69 2018-02-18 23:20:00 Agreed. It really hurts our collective psyche. But listening to the kids who have now been forced to become activists, even they are just asking for common sense restrictions on bump stocks, assault rifles, waiting periods and stricter registration guidelines. I defer to youth.
70 2018-02-18 23:19:59 None of that would have prevented Vegas. But we can't even get you to buck your NRA overlords long enough to ban bump stocks.
71 2018-02-18 23:19:46 Aussie market off to a quiet but softer start. #ASX 200 -0.08% or -4pts to 5899. Energy & mining stocks are weighing on equities. All other sectors up #ausbiz
72 2018-02-18 23:18:15 Not just children...adults as well and they are just as important. 
Increase the age to 25
no AR or bump stocks
nationwide laws not state by state
10 day background.
73 2018-02-18 23:17:51 It is amazing that Blotus & complicit GOP will not pass one piece of gun control legislation. Example: re-implement ban on assualt rifle; ban bump stocks. This could be done in 1 day & on Blotus' desk for signature.  Instead we get platitudes.
74 2018-02-18 23:17:09 And what else @TGowdySC ?  Bump stocks and what else?

We're waiting...

#EmmaGonzalez and her classmates and Republican constituents and the American people are waiting...

Bump stocks and what else?
75 2018-02-18 23:16:56 So, basically, Obama should not have made bump stocks legal.
76 2018-02-18 23:16:40 Don’t they just sell the numbers on immediately? We had a new number at work put on - within hours we had Nigerian scammers calling, Indian ‘technical supportings’ and stocks/shares scams all week until we called and complained. Stopped after that, oddly

78 2018-02-18 23:15:43 Are you proud of yourself for that one?No one is asking to stop people from having guns, just for sensible laws. No one needs automatic weapons except for military personnel, no one needs bump stocks. These are lives of our children! If it was Baron then...
79 2018-02-18 23:15:42 Man how you find a time to respond to everyone here !? You the best man !
80 2018-02-18 23:15:30 And you are right. There is a lot of blame to go around. Finger pointing isn’t the answer. Putting into ACTION safe guards is where we should be headed. Putting metal detectors In All schools, reopening mental institutions, legislation to ban bump stocks and semi-automatics2Begin
81 2018-02-18 23:14:51 & yes, that is an exaggeration but not by much. Some 2A proponents are arguing that there are NO limits to 2A & therefore CC across state lines, bump stocks & whatever else they decide they want
82 2018-02-18 23:14:24 I have no problem classifying bump stocks as Class 3 items.
83 2018-02-18 23:13:21 Levine's list is absurd! Basically *all* guns are semi auto. Bump stocks are very hard to legislate and have only been used in a crime once. Training is mandatory for CCW. But the fundamental disagreement is on the purpose of 2A:
84 2018-02-18 23:13:10 TERRA PRIME GROUP stocks slump
85 2018-02-18 23:12:56 You know what i'm talking about. Semi automatic guns dont belong in public hands. Plus, bump stocks make semi autos fire like automatics, so that kinda defeats the point of banning automatic weapons. Those are still legal at a federal level but banned in some states.
86 2018-02-18 23:12:28 Bump stocks reduce recoil. Not let a semi-auto fire like a machine gun. Auto/machine gun allows for pressing the trigger once for multiple shots. You still have to pull the trigger for each bullet fired even w/bump stock. Know what you’re talking about before you spout off.
87 2018-02-18 23:12:16 $GSW even though it's a dog, buying that bounce at $1 was the easiest trade of the day. Up 25% already on the bounce. #LEMMINGS never learn. Still think it's overvalued and wouldn't hold this LT, but money to be made trading this smashed stocks. $REA you are next !
88 2018-02-18 23:11:54 Here are some good places to start with #GunReformNow 1) mandatory 14 day waiting period 2) tighten background checks 3) eliminate sales at gun shows 4) ban bump stocks 5) limit magazine capacity 6)  require safety course including written and skills test for license
89 2018-02-18 23:10:45 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
90 2018-02-18 23:10:35 How about 45 reversing law for background check to prohibit psychologically diagnosed persons from buying a weapon? Bump stocks? Mandatory training (since a lot of deaths are accidental)? Storage & trigger locks laws? Do you agree w/Levine’s list?
91 2018-02-18 23:10:20 More stocks and less vacations
92 2018-02-18 23:10:00 In fact for a good portion of their history they were one of the biggest laughing stocks in sports
93 2018-02-18 23:09:44 This line of thinking created this nightmare. Arming us little old lady librarians is ludicrous. Just fix the laws and ban the damn AR 15s and bump stocks. Don't arm domestic abusers. Red flag laws work.
94 2018-02-18 23:08:17 It is not easy to express my ideas.Because my dession often take a mistake.I deal stocks when I miss decision that I lose money.I often lose money.I can belive my idea often bad.
95 2018-02-18 23:07:39 Perfect, then we all agree that bump stocks should be banned.  Who will care if they’re junk, right?
96 2018-02-18 23:07:35 Extended mags. Silencers. Armor penetrating anmo. Other assault rifles. Bump stocks. Oh, and I'd like a national registry of guns, purchases, and sellers. Required background checks for any and all gun sales. Research into ways we can make guns safer. Some other things.

100 2018-02-18 23:05:35 Bump stocks are junk and overrated. The fakenews msm made them popular. Any respectable gun dealer will tell anyone that. They’re junk.
101 2018-02-18 23:05:16 Nobody is suggesting taking all guns/background checks registration registration in transfer on ownership mental health no bump stocks no semi-automatic
102 2018-02-18 23:04:50 All I want for my birthday is God’s Blessings, some stocks, & books
103 2018-02-18 23:04:28 Do something! Why are bump stocks still legal??  Start there at least and just do something!  The mental health issue is not going to resolve itself tomorrow and is only part of problem. If we save one child's life by removing rapidly firing weapons, then it will be a success.
104 2018-02-18 23:04:21 AHAHA monoyoshi and hakatas stocks hahah- but awt48 too was gold hahaha
105 2018-02-18 23:03:37 The stock market lost all the previous years gains, and less than 50% of Americans own stocks even in 501ks.

The stock market only reflects the views of wealthy elite, the ones who elected Trump

108 2018-02-18 23:02:03 FBI, mental health, Russia distractions, etc..are NOT the real issue. Semi and Auto (bump stocks) are!! Get rid of theses guns. No ones needs them, other than killers!
109 2018-02-18 22:58:11 Like they banned bump stocks? I wouldn’t be surprised if @GOP @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @JohnCornyn loosen gun laws further to continue bowing & scraping to the @NRA
110 2018-02-18 22:58:11 I was a surrogate for you and Peggy at the SD46 precinct caucus. I will try to become a State Convention Delegate.  But you will lose me as a supporter unless you unambiguously come out against assault rifles and bump stocks.  This should be a no-brainer.
111 2018-02-18 22:57:53 Braven we’ve said this two separate times please read before you speak. We don’t want all guns gone. We just want semi and automatic weapons and things like stocks banned. Again this isn’t a hard thing to comprehend but you people are just too stubborn to see the compromise.
112 2018-02-18 22:57:29 well, fine, that is one reasonable action that can and should be taken. 

I really don't think that's the only action that should be taken. I'm ok with people owning handguns and shotguns. Not so much AR-15s, and not so much bump stocks, and I'm pretty sure the list could go on.
113 2018-02-18 22:57:14 The GOP will do nothing this is a good campaign point for our next democratic president. Stop the sales of assault Rifles and Bump stocks.

116 2018-02-18 22:55:41 hell yeh!
117 2018-02-18 22:55:32 Effective on February 1, 2018 my state Massachusetts banned bump stocks. So glad I live in a state that works to protect its citizens
118 2018-02-18 22:55:28 Now the stocks trading at 20.9 and last year it was around 10 or 11 $ so WB already doubled... ppl act like if he has bought his shares yesterday...
119 2018-02-18 22:54:32 Thanks Cory. I have a substantial database on lithium stocks and where they are currently staged but for $5 USD that information is cheap given the time it takes to accumulate. Will have a look into your Almanac. If you have the "Gray's Sports Alamanac 2k to 2050" send it too 
120 2018-02-18 22:54:17 Banning guns isn't common sense.  Enhanced background checks and getting rid of bump-stocks are things that can get done.
121 2018-02-18 22:53:30 @joetorresABC7 @SandraBookman7 @ABC7NY I was watching @FaceTheNation this morning, before @billritter7. I think Congressman Gowdy "hit the mark" (as nervous as I think he was, speaking...). He didn't think there needs to be legislation. ATF could BAN bump stocks?!?! @njburkett7
122 2018-02-18 22:52:59 dropped to 2000 but hey this is only going to go UP UP UP :D

125 2018-02-18 22:51:17 do the teachers get AR-15’s too? i mean it’s not fair if teachers don’t get their choice of weapon of war, teachers should get bump stocks or else we arent serious about children’s safety bc they’ll be outgunned by mental illness. body armor should be in the b
126 2018-02-18 22:49:58 Firearms Act of 1934 could be applied to assault weapons (semi - auto) weapons of mass casualties and destruction!  Bump stocks, high capacity magazines should also be part of the discussion!
127 2018-02-18 22:49:35 TO ALL REPUBLICAN DONORS WITH A BRAIN - Follow lead of Al Hoffman - Stop donating to Republican Party until assault rifles, bump stocks etc. r banned NATIONALLY. No more gun sales w/o background check - even private. Too much trouble? Tough - our kids r worth it. #StoptheNRA
128 2018-02-18 22:48:58 Watching the clip of Lionel Jeffries struggling to get out of a car that was rapidly sinking brings back a memory of MY frightening experience when a stunt involving me being stuck in stocks that fell forward nearly breaking my neck 
If I watch it i can still feel myself falling
129 2018-02-18 22:48:22 Bump stocks are a curiosity at best. If they were a real thing, the military would use them.
130 2018-02-18 22:48:18 Bump stocks don’t kill people, people kill people
131 2018-02-18 22:47:58 Rid our nation of AR 15's and Butt stocks. I voted for you. This is not a slippery slope. No more mass murders of our children or anyone.
132 2018-02-18 22:47:29 And if AR-15s & Bump Stocks are returned to the Ban List, the Massacre Weapon of Choice would be unavailable.
133 2018-02-18 22:46:45 All this ‘I’m for the 2nd amendment but think people shouldn’t get assault rifles’ BS. I’m against the #2ndAmendment - take away the guns, all of them. Reduce Americans gun stocks by 98%. Make it nearly impossible to get a gun. Fuck the #2ndAmendment.
134 2018-02-18 22:46:22 Right. Because banning bump stocks is easier than addressing the massive mental health issue that plagues America.
135 2018-02-18 22:46:16 Current #Congress is inept & will do nothing about amending gun laws. #SecondAmendment shouldn’t cover bump stocks,assault rifles, etc. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow -Need 2 address @ state level. DON’T VOTE 4 ANY STATE LAWMAKER SUPPORTING ACCESS 2 ASSAULT weapons or who takes $ from NRA
136 2018-02-18 22:46:06 Depends which state; bump stocks and drum mags are illegal. Kind of works against you doesn’t it.
137 2018-02-18 22:46:00 Going to start investing in stocks. Anybody got any good advice???
138 2018-02-18 22:45:56 @NJSenatorBooker Rid our nation of AR 15's and Butt stocks. I voted for you. This is not a slippery slope. No more mass murders of our children or anyone.
139 2018-02-18 22:43:54 @PRyan Rid our nation of AR 15's and Butt stocks. I voted for you. This is not a slippery slope. No more mass murders of our children or anyone.
140 2018-02-18 22:43:46 I could care less about bump stocks. Inaccurate fire and a waste of ammo. But lets not kid ourselves, banning bump stocks is not going to save one school kid. Single entry points during school with armed security at the door along with central lockdown and video surveillance will
141 2018-02-18 22:43:39 For example, machine guns (fully-automated assault rifles) are illegal. You don’t see people running around with them killing kids. So they get the “next best thing” - semi-auto assault-type rifles that do a ton of damage quickly but can also be modified to be auto (bump stocks).
142 2018-02-18 22:43:33 @McConnellsNeck Rid our nation of AR 15's and Butt stocks. I voted for you. This is not a slippery slope. No more mass murders of our children or anyone.
143 2018-02-18 22:42:49 @RealTrump2016 Rid our nation of AR 15's and Butt stocks. I voted for you. This is not a slippery slope. No more mass murders of our children or anyone.
144 2018-02-18 22:42:29 ES Distributors out of Florida is the company that stocks them on eBay here.
145 2018-02-18 22:42:00 Btw, I read and asked about Warren Buffet you kept mentioning. He was into stocks. That was what made him prominent. He was a master in that.
146 2018-02-18 22:41:26 Roll Call says Pelosi's wealth is connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks including "Apple, Comcast, Facebook, Shutterfly & Walt Disney.  Does this offend you?
147 2018-02-18 22:38:19 That's another option but Yer home bargains n B&M have the reusable ones in stocks so saves u the time  got mas like some nice green wans
148 2018-02-18 22:38:03 Lucid what would have happened had the shooter not had a assault semi automatic rifle??Why would any non brain dead person oppose thorough background checks, banning semi & automatic weapons, bump stocks etc? Unfathomable.
149 2018-02-18 22:37:44 The NRA supported banning Bump Stocks and Congress never addressed it. It doesn't much matter, tests have shown that a trained individual can fire a semi automatic AR15 almost as fast without that stock modification. Meaningless in a mass murder situation.
150 2018-02-18 22:37:39 Bump stocks are useless to get rid of when you can simply modify a trigger for $5.00.
151 2018-02-18 22:34:52 How about banning assault rifles? And what about this bumps stocks. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization #NRATerrorists #BloodMoney
152 2018-02-18 22:33:14 When your future mother in law stocks the fridge with Jamaican patties because she knows they are your fav 
153 2018-02-18 22:32:35 Restriction by permit maybe. But anyone who qualifies should be allowed to buy. Like a CDL - it shouldn't be restrictive but qualifying. Bump stocks are a bit of a canard as they can be manufactured at home with a variety of materials: e g Foam
154 2018-02-18 22:32:07 @Stocks_68 hey stocks tweet for the fans #Roulette
155 2018-02-18 22:31:50 @justinamash why has there been nothing done about bump stocks ?  Seems like you could at least get something done about them.
156 2018-02-18 22:31:20 5. No bump stocks

6. No cranks

7. Licenses for all arms — if cars have to be licensed and registered, so should guns

8. Child lock requirements

9. Minimum age of purchase at 21

10. Assault rifle ban

11. Ban on all easy convertible/adapted guns
157 2018-02-18 22:31:15 Your answer is wrong, every kill by a rifle with bump stocks, or by a person with mental issues or history of abuse, was aided by the NRA and their lobbyists. Plus you added a typical cuckservative remark. At least the koolaid from the “liberal press” has facts in it.
158 2018-02-18 22:30:11 @Stocks_68 dangles n silky moves to set up the OT winner wow just wow!!!
159 2018-02-18 22:28:42 That's the challenge, right? Defining "assault weapon." After all, even a BB gun can be used to "assault" someone. 

Couple starting points though: semiauto rifles, detachable magazines, military options like pistol grips, flash suppressors and folding stocks. High capacity mags.

161 2018-02-18 22:26:00 Last week was the 3rd week in a row that the Dow had failed to break the previous week's high. This sequence last extended to 4 weeks on 21 August 2015, 131 weeks ago (when the run lasted for 6 weeks) #stocks
162 2018-02-18 22:25:33 We're so sorry for any disappointment! Codes had to be entered by Jan 31, 2018. Specially-marked boxes may still be on shelves while stocks last. Thank you!
163 2018-02-18 22:25:00 The Dow has rallied for 6 days in a row, adding a total of 1359 points (+5.7%), making this the biggest 6 day gain since 22 February 2016, 502 trading days earlier #stocks

167 2018-02-18 22:21:43  love it, love it, love it.
168 2018-02-18 22:20:55 @RepThomasMassie  remember when you tweeted that forbidding bump stocks was a "red herring" for taking guns away from people? so is  video of the Parkland bloodied,  crying children a distraction?
169 2018-02-18 22:20:29 Obama already agreed with these students' views. Don't you dare blame Obama for your NRA-bought Republican politicians' refusal to pass sane policies to protect our public. They didn't even have the courage to ban bump stocks after #LasVegasShooting. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
170 2018-02-18 22:20:28 This doesn't mean that stocks is bad but we do not recommend using stocks until this mess has been cleared up. If we do feel that it is safe to use stocks we will of course list it on our website again.
171 2018-02-18 22:20:13 Btw i would personally like that bitcoin reach above 25k. Some people i know would get their lives back. Since they got screwed on penny stocks hype, and now they invested all in bitcoin.
172 2018-02-18 22:19:58 America should just go on Strike till stocks go to dow 1000 and white house threatens to force people to “work”  for what?  our expensive death? ayfkm?
173 2018-02-18 22:19:38 1994-2004 assault weapons were banned. People still went hunting still protected their homes. MASS murders dropped drastically. Ban them again along with bump stocks &high capacity magazines
174 2018-02-18 22:19:35 Leaveing you're stocks in the bed of you're truck for weeks doesn't make you're new wheels look any better
175 2018-02-18 22:18:41 I agree too....When the good things are saying have to take their advice. May they have not hold stocks for 5 or 10 years but their advice is good. One point is have to Identify good stocks to hold.
176 2018-02-18 22:18:39 Apparently Oprah made $360,000 off her Golden Globes speech from the rise in stocks for #WeightWatchers which she owns about 10% of the stocks in, bringing a new meaning to "living off the fat or the land"
177 2018-02-18 22:18:03 God Bless our troops!  THEY (and SWAT) are the only ones who need AR-15s.  Bump stocks serve one purpose, and need to be banned.  Nobody wants to repeal the 2nd amendment, people just want reasonable control laws (like no bump stocks).  Kids are pissed that NOTHING has been done
178 2018-02-18 22:17:05 Let's see. No one is asking for guns, just Assault Rifles and bum stocks. Just like I can't have a tank. In 7 minutes less murders and more opportunity to take the shooter out. Don't talk to me though, talk to the #ParklandSchool survivors. They were there. #bloodonyourhands
179 2018-02-18 22:16:41 @SpeakerRyan "dodged legislation outlawing bump stocks, a modification for semi-automatic weapons that allowed Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to rain death on a Las Vegas concert last October. At the time, even the NRA suggested it could support restrictions on the device."
180 2018-02-18 22:16:13 Entramos a la etapa final, 80 giros para conocer al ganador de la #DAYTONA500 ... una carrera en la que sólo quedan 29 stocks
181 2018-02-18 22:16:06 Awesome, thanks for the feedback. I'm strongly considering joining. His stock tweets are super simple and easy to follow. Are the private tweets more of the same? Do you feel like you are learning how to scan for and pick these stocks also? Thanks for getting back to me.
182 2018-02-18 22:14:49 ARE YOU SERIOUS ...FIRST OF ALL ....ONLY  89 %  ? ? ?  THAT IS SCARY RIGHT THERE ! ! !  AND SECONDLY , IF THAT HIGH A PER- CENTAGE... "  WHY THE HELL HASN'T SOMETHING BEEN DONE BY NOW ? ? ? "  REPUBLICANS  ,  WHILE YOU  ARE AT IT SHIT CAN BUMP STOCKS , TOO ! ! !
183 2018-02-18 22:14:45 So tell us what do you support? If no one has told you yet, a CLEAR majority of Americans support common sense gun regulations, including ban of assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and supporting common sense permitting and background checks. #MeNext
184 2018-02-18 22:14:42 I hope you don’t invest in stocks the same way you invest in Trump
185 2018-02-18 22:13:21 @realDonaldTrump & @SpeakerRyan meeting in Florida 2 discuss @GOP returning funds 2 @NRA. They plan 2 conference in @SenateMajLdr. All 3 to discuss banning bump stocks, assault rifles, adding 2 week waiting period & extensive background checks.  NOT, a decent person can dream.
186 2018-02-18 22:13:20 Except our forefathers were intending for a well-regulated militia. Not for disgruntled 19 year olds to have a semi-automatic weapon or middle-aged loners to blow away dozens and injure hundreds at concerts because he ordered bump stocks online.
187 2018-02-18 22:12:52 Situational. I've been 3 to 2 (stocks)up on a Samus, then SD'd, then got outllayed by him. I was also up 2 to 1 (stocks) to a falcon, SD'd and just nerves out about it and outllayed myself.

189 2018-02-18 22:11:50 To risky for me.  I use stocks, options, mutual funds and start-ups
190 2018-02-18 22:10:38 I only like to buy stocks that go up.
191 2018-02-18 22:10:27 NO ONE STOCKS EVER. DO YOUR JOB AAAAAHGGHH
192 2018-02-18 22:10:00 Last week's 114.75 point (+4.4%) rally was the biggest weekly gain seen in S&P Futures in the 267 weeks since 4 January 2013 #stocks
193 2018-02-18 22:09:51 It makes us sad to hear that you didn't get the recipe card in your kit , they're only til stocks last which might be why. Which store did you grab your devondale products from? 1/2
194 2018-02-18 22:09:46 2018 will probably be a record-setting year for stock buybacks due to recently passed tax reform bill. What will be interesting to see is how stocks perform after those buy-backs over a five and ten year period?
195 2018-02-18 22:08:09 Very sad that bump stocks and magazines that hold 30,40 or more bullets are not illegal. Give me one valid reason any normal sane person needs a bump stock or 30 bullets per load?
196 2018-02-18 22:07:46 Yes
197 2018-02-18 22:07:42 I do think it's wishful thinking that anything will be done about bump stocks. If they didn't after Vegas it's not happening.
198 2018-02-18 22:07:38 @DavidGFool I AGREE THAT THE STOCKS DROP FASTER, THEN RECOVER SLOWER AND HIGHER.
199 2018-02-18 22:07:26 He won us the braehead playoff game to
200 2018-02-18 22:07:08 Are you really this dishonest Marco. Ban weapons of  mass slaughter, ban bump stocks, ban large capacity magazines, close private and gun show sales loopholes. Create a buy back fund. As a start. The slaughter needs to end.
201 2018-02-18 22:06:21 He certainly caved on support for the bipartisan effort to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre.
202 2018-02-18 22:06:18 We couldn’t even get bump stocks banned let alone any type of gun reform.
203 2018-02-18 22:05:48 Ban of a specific class. Bump stocks...extended clips...guns like the AR-15. No need...public risk. Don’t in other countries and has worked.
204 2018-02-18 22:05:28 I cant get over that play by @Stocks_68 with under 20 seconds to go, absolutely clutch
205 2018-02-18 22:05:10 im buying a house, 2 cars, and investing the rest in stocks 
206 2018-02-18 22:05:03 I have same concern but have decided to ride the storm out.  If the value is there as we believe, U stocks will come back with a vengeance in the months ahead.  Saving a little dry powder to add if sector gets hit really hard.
207 2018-02-18 22:03:35 Stocks drop - Corps buy back at reduced prices = the rich get richer.
208 2018-02-18 22:02:54 Simple Fixes:  1. No bump stocks. 2. No assault weapons. 3. Background checks for all wherever guns are purchased. 4. Extreme taxes on non-.22 caliber bullets and shotgun shells including armor piercing and other shells
209 2018-02-18 22:02:50 If as the Florida Governor suggests that the FBI director should resign then every Rep. who refuses to even think about tighter gun controls &  making AR guns & bump stocks illegal should resign immediately &that includes the Pres & VP should resign immed they are also to blame
210 2018-02-18 22:02:47 This is a slippery slope. Guns are built by the manufacturers to have the ability to be modded. You can find instructions on how to do these mods online. If legislation ever banned semi automatics then watch 3D printing stocks go through the roof
211 2018-02-18 22:01:37 technically he’s right tho, the goal of smash is not to lose your stocks first so they outplayed you just by not SDing
212 2018-02-18 22:00:56 Right, I think bump stocks were just a way to get around the full auto thing
213 2018-02-18 22:00:42 Again, for the shoot
214 2018-02-18 22:00:08 Those restrictions are currently in place for assault rifles, but not for bump stocks which I personally cannot understand.
215 2018-02-18 22:00:01 You know stocks. Crazy
216 2018-02-18 21:59:48 The act of negotiation - in every negotiation - is dependent on the expressed good will of both sides. You know this already. 

You want bump stocks banned? Me too. You want crazies not to have guns? Me too. You want to seal all loopholes? Me too!
217 2018-02-18 21:59:44 1. Agreed we have strict laws here bump stocks have  been banned and you have to take a class at police station 1st then test
218 2018-02-18 21:59:30 That madam senator I agree with you on. No need for bump stocks that I can see.
219 2018-02-18 21:58:59 No, bump stocks don’t enable that rate of fire.
220 2018-02-18 21:58:42 
221 2018-02-18 21:58:39 Ban assault rifles if you want to make a difference  and no guns for anyone convicted or charged with domestic violence. No bump stocks. Change culture  Refuse NRA money. That’s truly how to make a difference
222 2018-02-18 21:58:27 *souris à ce que tu dis* On peut faire ça ? Ça serait super !! On doit renflouer nos stocks un peu *ris et mange mon assiette*
223 2018-02-18 21:58:16 haha, you seriously think I hang around waiting for your tweets so I can instantly answer you? How sad is that? Anything that could be called an assault rifle or be mistaken for one. Bump stocks, any mods that turn guns to autos. I'm not gonna list them all, I'd be here all day.
224 2018-02-18 21:57:31 $qtm and $omvs because I love holding stocks long enough to avoid capital gains just so I can see them fall below the price I bought them at.  #financialmasochism
225 2018-02-18 21:57:24 that have acess to ar15 rifles bump stocks and guns in general? So what are u going to do about that???
226 2018-02-18 21:57:09 After we clean up the businesses that are NRA affiliates, we need to move on to @Vanguard_Group and @Fidelity. Our retirements are being funded with gun stocks. Cut them off!
227 2018-02-18 21:56:52 Wow...this is excellent.  Great job, @POTUS . Hopefully you & Congress will listen to them & ban assault type weapons, bump stocks & large capacity magazines. @RepLeeZeldin @RepPeteKing @RepBrianMast @marcorubio @SenGillibrand
228 2018-02-18 21:56:08 Also, bump stocks were Clearly designed for Murder

Ban them ENTIRELY
229 2018-02-18 21:55:18 Deregulation allows for things like Goldman Sachs selling stocks to its clients while shorting the same stocks in their own favor. Instead of focusing on making business easier for their corporate sponsors, businesses could just pay their taxes increasing available funds for edu
230 2018-02-18 21:54:18 That last part is probably the most meaningful. Sadly the NRA has paid to many of your "peers" off so we know nothing will happen. Just like nothing happened to bump stocks after Vegas. This will just quietly go away until the next shooting, and the next, then the next...
231 2018-02-18 21:54:07 Choke points and preemptive arrests.  How about banning AR15s, bump stocks, & extended mags???!))
232 2018-02-18 21:54:04 Going to be running 3 stocks at my college weekly tomorrow., as well as custom palu and miis allowed. Kind of excited to see how it'll turn out, maybe people will like it.
233 2018-02-18 21:53:19 Lol no it isn’t. The lower has to be modified which can’t be done without a background in machining. And if you’re referring to bump stocks they don’t convert a gun to full auto. And the same can be accomplished with a belt loop.
234 2018-02-18 21:53:01 Thanks for the laugh!  Glad we sold all our stocks a month ago.
235 2018-02-18 21:51:29 great idea, lets arm the children, think of the arms stocks!
236 2018-02-18 21:50:19 Remember when Ryan was going to address Bump Stocks?
237 2018-02-18 21:49:23 Why hasn't Congress banned bump stocks? Bring back the ban. No one needs a semi automatic that can hold high capacity magazines. Florida has very lax gun laws.
238 2018-02-18 21:49:01 How will removing Bump Stocks and ARs have zero impact? If there is a consequence to them in the public hand, it will help - it's no different than any other law.  Sure some people will break the law, but it's better than nothing. Traffic laws are no different.
239 2018-02-18 21:47:46 Why is there nothing like Grover Norquist‘s „Taxpayer Protection Pledge“, but for guns? A „Protect our Children Pledge“! Compared to these senseless killings, who gives a damn about taxes? Team up with cops, ex-Army and PUT THE PRESSURE on politicians! No bump stocks etc!
240 2018-02-18 21:47:34 Bump Fire stocks. Slidefire stocks. Why so many after-market products to simulate the automatic firing of assault rifles?
241 2018-02-18 21:47:34 I'm with you on that, bump stocks are not necessary. it just sounded like you wanted more than that.
242 2018-02-18 21:47:24 Nobody needs bump stocks.  You even said as much.  Yet nobody is willing to ban them.  I can’t keep repeating myself....  You’re inability to concede something as useless as that is why the kids have had enough.  Your rigid mentality has created the bed you’re going to lay in
243 2018-02-18 21:46:34 Jason, what other stocks do you like now?
244 2018-02-18 21:46:31 Why is there nothing like Grover Norquist‘s „Taxpayer Protection Pledge“, but for guns? A „Protect our Children Pledge“! Compared to these senseless killings, who gives a damn about taxes? Team up with cops, ex-Army and PUT THE PRESSURE on politicians! No bump stocks etc!
245 2018-02-18 21:46:15 I'm being serious I'm genuinely asking you do you recommend any stocks then? I'm not trying to trick you.
246 2018-02-18 21:45:49 Says the guy with armed guards 24/7. Banning guns, bullets, bump stocks, etc won’t stop are darn thing. Sick people who want to kill people will find ways around it. Put an armed cop in the building and it least give those kids a chance.
247 2018-02-18 21:45:19 You cannot alter an “assault bat” or “assault hammer” to increase force that you, as the wielder, do not possess. you CAN increase the rapid fire of the semi-auto AR-15 with bump stocks (which he owned) making it an automatic. Besides, assault weapons are meant for mass casualty.
248 2018-02-18 21:44:45 @KenPaxtonTX  Talk to the students in Fla. and suggest they join the NRA and discover the NRA supports and teaches gun safety, supports background checks, denounces bump stocks, etc. They will be surprised that the NRA does more to advance gun safety than any other group.
249 2018-02-18 21:44:32 @FifeFlyers well done boys! Champions ! @Stocks_68 @nucci39 @A_Iles33 @elcreido18 @Heeels @CharlieMosey @C_Schaber @bloodz_25 @RussMoyer @PeteyL88 @Marrsy33 @Josh_Scoon @jjorgensen15 @dirtydc13 @jisaacs5
250 2018-02-18 21:43:39 So printing money at a alarming rate, over valuing stocks just stall the inevitable. I am not trying to educate you. School system and MSM has done their job well. I am trying to open your eyes.
251 2018-02-18 21:43:30 That's big of you. Any thoughts on the death machine you attach bump stocks to?
252 2018-02-18 21:43:08 Awww what a beautiful boy, and what lovely gift from Fife, hope he gets well soon from Sheffield xx
253 2018-02-18 21:42:06 Are you allowed to use bump stocks with those?
254 2018-02-18 21:41:57 We don't need bump stocks
255 2018-02-18 21:40:18 Never stop trying @nucci39 points this season have been great
256 2018-02-18 21:40:15 هذا اصعب سؤال ومحير الناس كلها ومحد لاقي له جواب
257 2018-02-18 21:39:31 We know what to do: a majority of US favor commonsense #GunSafety measures to pass background checks, close the terrorist loophole, reverse the ban on CDC gun research, add mental health $ & ban bump stocks. But Republicans lack the political will to act - so we must #VoteThemOut
258 2018-02-18 21:39:22 While the GVRO may have some merit, it does not go far enough to protect citizens. This article says nothing about common sense rule changes eliminating loopholes and curtailing the sale of assault rifles and bump stocks. These changes do not take away 2nd amend rights.
259 2018-02-18 21:39:00 To be fair, a liberal probably thinks that air guns and bb guns have bump stocks, hold a million rounds, and can be upgraded to automatic firing capacity.
260 2018-02-18 21:37:50 Cockroach Jill has NO principles, owns stocks in corporations that pollutes and ripoff the American people.  Hypocrite, Jill only comes out of the dark every 4 yrs to campaign for donations, SHE is all about MONEY.  "Jill Stein"
261 2018-02-18 21:37:06 Have you been drinking or do ya need to look up "should" in the dictionary?There is no ban because the fucking GOP won't let any go through. I distinctly remember one trying to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre and nope the GOP wanted their NRA money, so didn't happen.
262 2018-02-18 21:36:51 Hope one day, shops will run out make -up stocks, I  wanna see the true identity  of some peeps
263 2018-02-18 21:36:36 Cockroach Jill has NO principles, owns stocks in corporations that pollutes and ripoff the American people.  Hypocrite, Jill only comes out of the dark every 4 yrs for campaign donations, SHE is all about MONEY.

275 2018-02-18 21:31:33 I am still appalled that in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting the company that makes bump stocks had a record breaking year. Yes, there were people who read about that tragedy & their takeaway was, “I want a bump stock.”
276 2018-02-18 21:29:51 No that’s not what I was doing. What I was doing was parroting back what I have been seeing all day. ie: cars don’t kill people. GET IT? I’m all for the second amendment but not for weapons of mass killing. Bump stocks, 30 round clips.
277 2018-02-18 21:29:23 Good job! May I say Plz don't wear pu**y hats or that other stuff.  Stay only on point! I think all immature distraction is what completely WEAKENS credibility of any cause! We need SPECIFIC points....Like, "BAN BUMP STOCKS", or "NO MORE 20 ROUND MAGAZINES".  Not just 'ban guns'.
278 2018-02-18 21:28:51 Pretty sure you can support 2nd amend. AND support ban on AR-15, bump stocks and large capacity magazines. Why does anyone need an AR-15? @brithume
279 2018-02-18 21:28:05 Junk Bonds go first then Junk Stocks then Junk Markets then the rest of it...
280 2018-02-18 21:27:24 Huge congratulations to the Fife Flyers  on their 7-6 win tonight to claim the Gardiner Conference. It had plenty off edge of your seat action. what more could you ask for in a game. Well done @A_Iles33 @Marrsy33 @PeteyL88 @Chadmister10 @nucci39 @RBirzi @Stocks_68 
281 2018-02-18 21:26:53 Cool. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity ammo.
282 2018-02-18 21:26:02 you don't have to own one full "coin".  You can own fractional portions.  Also do you compare the market caps between these crypto's and these stocks?  Which has more room to grow?
283 2018-02-18 21:25:55 No one wants 2 hear your prayers 4 the victims anymore.  What happened 2 the ban on bumper stocks?  How much money have u gotten from the NRA?  Get a backbone & do something about semi automatics & large capacity magazines already. That's what these mass killers have used.
284 2018-02-18 21:25:24 Every @FifeFlyers but if I had to narrow it down I'd go for @elcreido18, @Stocks_68 @C_Schaber @A_Iles33 can't narrow it down any further than that . All awesome.
285 2018-02-18 21:25:21 I’m 100% against appealing the 2nd amendment!  Why not start with banning bump stocks?  I don’t think it’s unfair to question the need for these.  Is that a fair starting point?
286 2018-02-18 21:24:34 Would you agree that this is a reasonable request to the public? Especially with children at risk? To sacrifice assault rifles and bump-stocks for the sake of a little breathing room until we can get this whole ordeal sorted out?
287 2018-02-18 21:24:05 My profile. Then tweets
288 2018-02-18 21:23:41 As far as AR 15s, my understanding is that most guns these days are semiautomatic.  Please correct me if I’m wrong! With the addition of bump stocks and gat cranks the rifles can approximate automatic fire.
289 2018-02-18 21:23:40 6 point weekend and conference champions!  congrats lads! @Stocks_68 @nucci39 @C_Schaber @RussMoyer @Heeels @bloodz_25 @A_Iles33 @CharlieMosey @elcreido18 @PeteyL88 @jjorgensen15 @jisaacs5 @RBirzi
290 2018-02-18 21:23:05 1.  Ban assault weapons
2.  Ban re-selling of assault weapons
3.  By-back program
3.  Ban bump stocks & high cap mags
4.  Background checks on ALL guns sold, not just from gun store
5.  No conceal carry reciprocity
6.  Require safety test and registration like a driver's license
291 2018-02-18 21:22:50 Glad I found it, but...the future of my gift hunting sort of hinges on this. There is one, repeat, ONE shop in all of CT that reliably stocks this, and I drove an hour there and an hour back to get it.
292 2018-02-18 21:22:48 @SenateMajLdr Improve K-12 school security. Educate teachers, parents, MD's. Improve mental health services. Ban sale of guns/rifles to anyone <21. Ban unlicensed gun dealers. Have a 2-day min waiting period. Improve background checks. Fire Obama appointees @FBI. Ban bump stocks.
293 2018-02-18 21:22:42 Yes, but bump stocks make them automatic fire and last I checked they aren't illegal. 

If you want to keep advocating for doing nothing then a tidal wave will come.  Some people are trying to find a solution to reckless slaughter in our country.

299 2018-02-18 21:18:46 Action means sending back and no longer accepting #NRABloodMoney. It means voting for laws to ban AR-15, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Close all background check loopholes and keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. #RejectTheNRA #VoteOutNRASupporters
300 2018-02-18 21:17:59 Morning all, stocks might sell down today?
301 2018-02-18 21:17:55 1) I wrote the article, so it is my opinion. One that I have backed up facts.
2) You think that the @NRA hasn't blocked any meaningful attempt at #GunControl? Why were bump stocks not banned after Vegas?
302 2018-02-18 21:17:37 So proud of our boys. Nail biting tonight, but we battled through to make fife supporters so very proud. My nerves are shot. I’ve lost my voice. But hey, we’re conference champs. Hope you enjoy tonight guys.
303 2018-02-18 21:17:10 Hell yeah boys! Boom! @FifeFlyers @nucci39 @Stocks_68 @RBirzi @jisaacs5 @PeteyL88 @A_Iles33 @elcreido18 @RussMoyer @bloodz_25 @C_Schaber @jjorgensen15 @Chadmister10 @Josh_Scoon Huge congrats! 
304 2018-02-18 21:16:43 Bump stocks don't do didly. If they were a thing the military would use it.

Apparently
306 2018-02-18 21:14:53 Well, since the former CDC director purchased tobacco stocks, we're dealing with imbeciles.

309 2018-02-18 21:14:01 That will work out til something happens and media cries foul, this isn't Friday night pure stocks at the Billy Bob Speedway #NASCAR
310 2018-02-18 21:13:51 Gun control & banning of ASSAULT type guns, bump stocks & armor piercing bullets MUST BE BANNED in this country. Weapons of war & geared to do one thing-kill as many as possible.Proving someone needs a restraining order? In FL where 3/4 of state is gun crazy? Almost impossible.
311 2018-02-18 21:13:16 Russia used you as a pawn
312 2018-02-18 21:13:09 Bump stocks are illegal in almost every state
313 2018-02-18 21:12:05 I also don't think the average citizen needs access to AR15's or bump stocks that allow them to be "modified" to they point where they can "spray" bullets.
314 2018-02-18 21:11:33 This would be a good start, coupled with required education, age limits, insurance, as well as bans on bump stocks, high capacity magazines and weapons that exist only to kill people in war.
315 2018-02-18 21:11:07 wtf justification do they have for fucking bump stocks? there's no justification for any of this shit.
316 2018-02-18 21:11:03 What are you going to do about gun control?  Background checks?  Make access to semi-automatic weapons more difficult? Ban bump stocks?  Anything?  Or your usual not a damn thing?  Party before country, right?
317 2018-02-18 21:10:13 Our store stocks decals from Blue 84. They are a division of Lakeshirts. Great quality & both divisions do custom designs.
318 2018-02-18 21:08:53 From day one-Trump’s campaign and Presidency has been all about the money. His greed and need to line his pockets at America’s expense is staggering. All Trumpsters who think he’s giving them jobs should consider that the current buy back of stocks by corporations means no jobs.
319 2018-02-18 21:06:27 And the power of science has taken us from muzzle-loaders to bump stocks, 30 round mags, armor-piercing bullets, and more, and made them so plentiful and cheap that anyone can afford them.  It’s not a one-sided argument.

323 2018-02-18 21:04:05 atleast you said excellent for mining stock. Only thing those stocks are not owned by majority of people who are black. Now it is being scrapped meaning transformation in the sector remains a dream.
324 2018-02-18 21:02:34 Bump stocks were used in 1 mass shooting, LV. I agree that they should be outlawed but there's a reason that they are not commonly used. 50 and 100 round mags tend to jam, a problem for shooters "in" the zone of operation but less so for a sniper perched high above it.
325 2018-02-18 21:02:10 There will I fear always be vile people willing to commit vile acts. We shouldn’t be accessories to that by arming them (legally) with military-grade guns and bump-stocks that make them even more deadly and vile.
326 2018-02-18 21:01:35 You're behind the curve @TGowdySC . Bump stocks were a way to distract from the real issue after Las Vegas. As the deaths mount the only solution is an assault weapons ban! Get on board or accept you will be complicit in future deaths!
327 2018-02-18 21:00:49 So why are we still legally giving people tools that make murder SO easy and SO deadly? We don’t sell bombs or grenades. We do sell military-grade rifles and bump-stocks.

330 2018-02-18 20:59:57 Why do civilians need bump stocks? They don't, but this do nothing GOP Congress can't even get them out of the public. Guess the murder of 50+ civilians & the wounding of countless other innocents wasn't  enough.The GOP continue 2 be complicit in the slaughter of r people & kids
331 2018-02-18 20:59:17 Didn't take long for bump stocks to fall off the radar after Las Vegas.  I've got a bit more hope with the kids #NeverAgain leadership.

343 2018-02-18 20:54:27 Thank you a great listen. Its really informative to here you’re insight about stocks you previously bought.
344 2018-02-18 20:54:17 Bump stocks? Lol.

Silencers? You mean suppressors. Which don't silence gunshots.

And banning both of them wouldn't have prevented a single mass shooting. They're talking points. Nothing more.
345 2018-02-18 20:54:09 $4T in CB QE + lifetime high debt for corps, personal & govn + lowest saving rate to get a 2.5 GDP = $ poorly spent. A  2.4 savings rate is where recessions begin. Highest cons debt w/rising rate/inflation = a disaster for stocks. Grow your savings.
346 2018-02-18 20:53:43 @tastytraderMike first of all, THANK YOU! New to @thetastyworks, starting to get into options after watching so much of what you guys have shared. Trying to build a Margin & IRA portfolios, do you guys have everything in options, or is it a combination of stocks and options?
347 2018-02-18 20:53:39 The best fear analogy is the Capital vs. the Districts, where we're not in a position to check our own gov't (what the 2nd is actually for). The middle ground on laws: federally outlaw the things everyone can agree on: automatics, bump stocks, 50 cal.
348 2018-02-18 20:52:47 Because it’s a bad idea especially giving that right to teachers example someone gets pissed off at you they file a report there goes your guns no thanks I agree with stricter gun laws as far as getting one and no bump stocks
349 2018-02-18 20:52:45 Gutted!!! Always been wary of laminate stocks, surely they're prone to split? Get it dropped into a GRS Berserk or something Eric. 
350 2018-02-18 20:52:06 The Chocolate Shop closed before Christmas when they could have sold more of their stocks. Now the premises were sold how odd to break the property. So a new owner of the stock room just the other side of the wall. I hope it will not be used to put G5 experimentation.
351 2018-02-18 20:52:03 All assault weapons, any and all high capacity mags, and any of the accessories like bump stocks and kits must be banned! Now, not later, no discussion, just write it and get is signed. No more talk or prayer!!
352 2018-02-18 20:51:06 The next thing that will happen is that the SCOTUS will way in and stop states from banning semi-automatics, bump-stocks, and large capacity magazines. That will basically put an end to gun control.
353 2018-02-18 20:51:02 Doubt that will be effective, i.e., the next mass murderer has already bought his gun now, or even before today, or will buy it before a ban takes place. I suggest nibbling around the edges: banning high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. Mental health care.
354 2018-02-18 20:51:01 Would you be OK with restricting civilian access to automatic weapons and bump stocks in a few states and seeing if it helps? Trying not to be partisan and accept that total ban is unworkable
355 2018-02-18 20:50:34 I see No reason why anyone needs bump stocks, silencers and high capacity mags. If they are that bad at shooting they should quit. Mental health needs more focus and trump just made it easier for them to purchase. Licenses and checks for all sales
356 2018-02-18 20:50:13 Keep thinkin that Rush til the stocks keep dropping and you're loosing yourour gov't is unstable and the world knows about our UNFIT PREZ
357 2018-02-18 20:49:33 Bum stocks should be illegal, we need extensive background checks and regulations on assault rifles. Stand up, speak out, make a change! Be a leader and pave the way for your fellow congressmen. Enough is enough. This is coming down on dem/rep that won’t stand up to the NRA!
358 2018-02-18 20:49:30 I think there are certain areas of broad consensus - bump stocks, quasi-military weapons like AR-15s, etc. let’s do THAT stuff, along with enhanced background checks and similar measures, and then we can argue about the rest.
359 2018-02-18 20:48:58 How come NO ONE who read his ‘disturbing content on social media’ or NO ONE who he discussed killing small animals with or NO ONE who heard his threats, called ANYONE who could do something about it. I agree with no bump stocks and 100 round mags but Jesus admit social decay.
360 2018-02-18 20:48:34 "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Doesn't say anything about AR-15's, bump stocks, large magazines, hand grenades, BARs etc.
361 2018-02-18 20:48:22 That's 100% untrue - they advocate for #NICSFix and even came out after Vegas voicing their concerns with bump stocks. What they lobby in favor of is the PROTECTION of the #2A, which myself and 6 million of my closest friends PAY them to do.
362 2018-02-18 20:47:31 Thanks
363 2018-02-18 20:46:55 I often wonder what will the prices of things be at the future considering that the price of things of certain commodities have increased gradually over few years. I think someday the price of chocolate might reach $1m .

364 2018-02-18 20:46:05 Dear Congress: We need to regulate magazine capacity. If we just ban bump stocks, know that there are other devices that can make guns (even hand guns) behave as fully auto. Shut down gun shows; they are too unregulated. We need to strengthen background checks. #GunLawsNOW
365 2018-02-18 20:46:04 1. Quit comparinging guns and cars.

2. no one wants to take your guns away.

3. common sense laws do not hinder your privilege to legally own a firearm.

4. numbers dont lie

7 day waiting period, national background check, clip limits, no bump stocks, etc...

#werbetterthanthis
366 2018-02-18 20:45:30 What do you do with those already owned?  If we don't accept that one.  What if we are willing to allow ATF to regulate bump stocks as any other weapon?
367 2018-02-18 20:45:22 If history repeats first inflation boost is positive for stocks same as first rounds of interest hikes.
368 2018-02-18 20:45:08 How about just start by banning bump stocks? Doesn’t infringe any rights to own firearms, oh sorry that would make sense so the NRA and GOP would oppose
369 2018-02-18 20:44:43 No one is trying take or repeal the 2nd amendment. Please share w/the world your reasoning that the public needs assault rifles, bump stocks, & the like as an option. Instead of just criticizing these true leaders, provide an option that will work for all. Dialogue NOT Monologue!
370 2018-02-18 20:44:31 As your constituent, what changes have you prompted since Thursday? Have you challenged @realDonaldTrump to do anything? I have begged you and @repbrianmast to enact sensible gun reforms. Remember Vegas and your pledge re bump stocks? Your silence is deafening. #DouglasStrong

383 2018-02-18 20:41:32 Nope, but I can say that when the constitution was written it didn’t address types of guns and magazines and bump stocks and silencers that are now in existence.  Someone’s right to bear arms shouldn’t infringe on my right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

385 2018-02-18 20:40:50 How many Mass Shootings involved Bump Stocks?
It's the damn Assault Weapons!
386 2018-02-18 20:40:48 The time has come to take real action on commonsense gun safety reforms in Florida. I wholeheartedly support a ban on assault weapons, high capacity magazines, & bump stocks. We must do all we can to keep our children & our neighbors safe. #ShawForFlorida
387 2018-02-18 20:40:42 it's a good idea. I suggest you also do 3 stocks to make the games last a little longer / make them less jank

389 2018-02-18 20:39:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
390 2018-02-18 20:39:19 I hear that the BB guns they used also had big scary triggers, imposing butt stocks & even a barrel.

Similar to those at Toys R Us.

Oh the drama!!!
391 2018-02-18 20:39:05 Maybe you can ban bump stocks.  How brave.  Ban assault weapons and keep our kids from being murdered at school or go home
392 2018-02-18 20:38:20 That is true. #Salmon farming has turned the west coast of Scotland into one big open sewer and decimated our wild salmon stocks. #ScottishSalmonScandal
393 2018-02-18 20:38:00 It doesn't matter if they mobilized or not, more laws are useless. Just look at Massachusetts. They tried to ban bump-stocks, it is massive failure. The people said HELL NO and refused to turn them into the gov't. 90 years later, and gov't hasn't learned a thing from Prohibition.
394 2018-02-18 20:37:57 @Rowan_Stocks
395 2018-02-18 20:35:54 Stocks & Bonds. The human is the Stock & the Birth Certificate (Strawman) is the Bond. That's where it (S&B) came from.
396 2018-02-18 20:35:49 Easy first A: start with banning bump stocks and requiring all rifle purchasers to be 21 just like with handguns. 

Or is this too hard to do because the NRA is just too tasty a dish for some people?
397 2018-02-18 20:33:09 Join me in founding the hedge fund "Nemesis" dedicated to shorting the stocks of companies fun by egomaniacs.  First position: large short of $TSLA
398 2018-02-18 20:33:01 Semi auto is: one trigger pull shoots one round. I would argue that bump stocks and similar technology be outlawed, not these rifles. They fire the same as manual weapons, until you try to make an automatic weapon out of them.
399 2018-02-18 20:32:48 I see Denver Colorado just made it illegal to own bump stocks. Its a start....
400 2018-02-18 20:32:47 Ya know, if ya want to discuss something, stay on topic. What the heck do bump stocks have to do with this conversation?
Apparently my intellect isn't up to the challenge of following you....
401 2018-02-18 20:31:59 Midwestern grain stocks are rotting so that the products of the North Dakota oil boom can be shipped by rail to Asia and Europe.
402 2018-02-18 20:30:29 Oh, look. The "Constable." What are you gonna do? Throw me in "ye stocks?"
403 2018-02-18 20:29:50 Really? Is that why Dems is the home of the KKK? Dems want to allow abortion even at the latest term in Pregnancy. Sessions I don't care for, he affects my stocks. I don't like him.

405 2018-02-18 20:28:24 Tried bump stocks ban after vegas, (Dems added language to bill that banned more than bump stocks which is why it failed). People need to realize Dems dont want to pass immigration or more gun laws. Look what they add to bills to kill them. If laws pass they lose talking points
406 2018-02-18 20:28:16 Ed, you have many good points,but, some go too far and would end up causing unintended consequences. Not being able to manipulate the way ammo works may cause problems for those who reload their own ammo. Semi-auto shouldn't be compared to auto weapons, if bump stocks aren't used
407 2018-02-18 20:27:59 I hope this helps the price of the stocks to rise
408 2018-02-18 20:27:12 Le curé du coin demande s'il vous reste des stocks.
409 2018-02-18 20:26:48 Of course not. But any gun that can shoot rapidly and can be altered to shoot even faster does not belong in civilian hands. Nor should bump stocks, 30 round clips, or silencers be available to just anybody. Licensing, background checks, & training should be required gun owners.
410 2018-02-18 20:26:36 Congrats on winning the conference @RussMoyer @C_Schaber @elcreido18 @A_Iles33 @PeteyL88 @nucci39 @hutchy071 @dirtydc13 @Heeels @Stocks_68 @bloodz_25 @jjorgensen15 
411 2018-02-18 20:26:32 Never have I heard such ignorance. The St Valentine's Day massacre was not committed with machine guns nor do bump stocks turn semi auto rifles into machine guns. Typical from you though.
412 2018-02-18 20:25:10 Yeah what the husband said 
413 2018-02-18 20:25:08 I own a Glock 19, a bolt-action rifle, and a shotgun. I enjoy shooting & I support #2A. But #EnoughIsEnough we need #GunReformNow:
 Universal background checks
 Ban bump stocks, high capacity mags
 Reinstate assault weapons ban
 Crack down on law-breaking FFLs
414 2018-02-18 20:22:56 Alot of states are now banning bump stocks because you and congress can’t get out of your own way. What are you doing?  Make realist #GunReform. It’s not the guns. How many republicans have involved in mass shootings. Maybe you should set a better example for your party. #Dems
415 2018-02-18 20:22:21 Congrats guys! What a season and clearly the best team in scotland this season!  #Champs #PeskyFlyers @FifeFlyers @C_Schaber @elcreido18 @CharlieMosey @A_Iles33 @RBirzi @Heeels @bloodz_25 @PeteyL88 @jisaacs5 @jjorgensen15 @Stocks_68 @nucci39 @Josh_Scoon @Marrsy33 @hutchy071
416 2018-02-18 20:22:06 Bump stocks? Nothing done. AR-15’s are not necessary for anyone outside of the military. Do something
417 2018-02-18 20:22:05 Lets invest in these stocks, let’s vacay on these yatchs
418 2018-02-18 20:22:04 pretty much the only thing that *maybe* would have helped in Vegas is banning bump stocks, bump stocks should not be something people can buy. Of course, Congress has taken zero action on that one.
419 2018-02-18 20:20:37 Crickets eh.  Banning all semi automatic weapons and bump stocks immediately would be a freaking great start.
420 2018-02-18 20:19:56 Lol. I understand why kindle won’t be up to date, as it’s hard to keep all stocks updated. But why not wifi? And why is USB hard?
421 2018-02-18 20:19:30 #BlackPantherMovie is breaking records and Disney execs are making a WHOLE lot of money from this movie. But did we stop and think to even BUY stocks in Disney? Just food for thought
422 2018-02-18 20:18:03 Crickets, am done talking about security, it's already excessive & burdensome, but discussion right now is semi-automatic weapons, large magazines, bump stocks, any other war "toys". You've been dodging it, Salty. Do you have any?
423 2018-02-18 20:17:31 They said the same thing about bump stocks after Las Vegas... still no action.
424 2018-02-18 20:17:08 Age 21 for all but shotguns, ban bump stocks (as long as Dems dont expand the language as they did in bill after vegas), a law for mental health check, one for increasing waiting period to 21 days (ATF has more time on background) those should pass
425 2018-02-18 20:16:54 she must be having investments in stocks thats why shes opening her 
426 2018-02-18 20:15:51 95% of Feinstein's proposal and the original AW ban IS cosmetic. Focus on functional differences (easily changeable magazines and magazine capability, and now bump stocks and the like)and you can make a difference. All the "black rifle" fashion accessory bans are BS.
427 2018-02-18 20:15:45 Didn't they say the same shit about Bump Stocks after Las Vegas?

How's that working out?
428 2018-02-18 20:14:59 lets talk stocks; your $600,000 is going to $1300. in 60 days time sire.  you may want to just cash out of these sex intoxicated drug coma america
429 2018-02-18 20:14:59 Stocks are boomin 
430 2018-02-18 20:14:38 Stocks and Shares ISA all the way for me :) one of my goals to make more people aware that investing isn’t scary when you do it right (and tax free) :)
431 2018-02-18 20:13:43 Plus these new laws would make sure that person who snapped wouldn’t have an arsenal of semi-autos with bump-stocks making them fire like machine guns and amor-piercing bullets. So they’d be less likely to kill 58 people in under 10 minutes.
432 2018-02-18 20:12:58 Absolutely the starter ground for investing has to be maxing out your ISA quota on a Stocks and Share ISA. Ideally one that is index linked - averaging 4-10% interest in past years and tax free :) most banks offer them so very straight forward and easy. Hope that helps!
433 2018-02-18 20:12:42 No.

Tell you what, the Hughes Amendment to the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act is what got us bumpfire stocks.  We should start by repealing the Hughes Amendment.  Then NOBODY NEEDS A BUMPFIRE STOCK
434 2018-02-18 20:12:39 Everyone purchasing a gun should have a background check. No one under 21 can buy a gun except for single bolt hunting rifle if s patent signs as responsible, now multi- bullet cartrages for semi-automatic weapons like the AR15. No bump stocks. No instant gun sales @gunshows
435 2018-02-18 20:12:11 Mais il faut changer nos indicateurs, tableaux de bord car même notre manière de compter est complètement fausse, car ne ne tient pas compte ni des externalités négatives ou positives ni de la destruction de nos stocks de ressources naturelles (minières, biodiversité, etc...)
436 2018-02-18 20:12:02 What's the pecking order for stocks this week? Cryptos could see some moneyflows coming back in.
437 2018-02-18 20:12:00 That's it, the stocks may recover as the week rolls on, I'll leave my T7 here and see, time to jump into the Vulture....
438 2018-02-18 20:11:47 We need to ban assault weapons and the bump stocks, and enforce better gun laws with background checks that can be enforced everywhere, not just in gun stores.
439 2018-02-18 20:10:46 Perhaps a cargo fitted python is the way to go then? I don't know how often stocks get replenished but we'll see. I think there's res sites in system so for up the vulture I say!
440 2018-02-18 20:10:10 I don’t think you understood the message. There’s no need for any automatic weapons. No silencers/No bump stocks. Close the loopholes. Stronger background checks. Long waiting periods. 
Personal or hunting only.
441 2018-02-18 20:09:56 @GOP lost the 2018 midterm elections this week by allowing the Parkland students take control of the talking points of what's important to the majority of Americans. We will ban bump stocks, reinstate mental health check prior to purchasing firearms, and sanction Russia. #bluewav
442 2018-02-18 20:09:52 So that’s good! We can expect buy backs and laws banning sales of AR-15 and bump-stocks THIS week!!
443 2018-02-18 20:09:26 It is also because  there is a balancing act between keeping down bond yields and dumping stocks in a quasi reciprocal manner. In the process QE is going to make its way into mainstream. Inflationary pressure via stagflation is now in play
444 2018-02-18 20:08:54 With how #fintech is growing and how payments will continue to revolutionize the industry it is crazy to say that $MA $V and $PYPL will not continue to grow. All three will be in the middle and part of the revolution. #Long #Mastercard #Visa #stocks #investing
445 2018-02-18 20:08:06 That’s not true. No one, except maybe a minority, is advocating wholesale abolishment of private firearms. But there is sadly too much room for improved safety. These guys haven’t even taken a vote in banning bump stocks. Something that agree on. #bloodOnGOPHands
446 2018-02-18 20:07:27 When people shoot up a movie theater, music concert and school with an AR-15, the Gun Lovers don't want to ban semi-automatic rifles or bump stocks. They blame mental health. Please explain your logic?
447 2018-02-18 20:06:37 I think people mainly concerned about the AR-15 and AK-47 style military assult and bump stocks. There's no easy answers. There needs to be real mental health prof. in all schools K-12, Armed security schools, FBI & Law enforcment Protocol needs to be updated, So many things.
448 2018-02-18 20:06:30 So show us the gun safety laws you support. Banning assault weapons? Closing the gun show loophole? Lifting the ban on gov funding for gun research? Banning bump stocks??????
449 2018-02-18 20:06:02 Ineffective gun control laws?? Like the ones they have in nearly every other country in the world where they DO NOT have these mass shootings?? NO, We are done with your B.S. It is time to ban semi-automatics, bump stocks, have a gun buyback and universal background checks! FU!
450 2018-02-18 20:05:42 Nah. If im sticking my dick in someone while we play and fuck up and SD on our last stocks, they aint do nothing

thats the only exception to me
451 2018-02-18 20:05:00 If you’re not willing to concede that bump stocks serve no purpose, other than to murder, and should therefore be banned, you are the reason this march is happening.  No change is not acceptable anymore.  Nobody wants to take away all your guns, stop with that garbage
452 2018-02-18 20:04:44 Few have the means to trade stocks w/ their own money and not have a boss.  I would contend that such people don't live in the "real world". What's your definition of the real world?
453 2018-02-18 20:04:39 Bump stocks? Not even an accessory to transform a semi-automatic weapon into one far, far more efficient (i. e. deadly) Really? Won’t even take bump stocks off of the market? Really? It’s a no fuckin’ brainer.
454 2018-02-18 20:04:35 It seems you are not looking in the right places. There is a lot of consensus as to what can be done. In fact, there was a bi-partisan effort right after Sandy Hook for national regulation. It was thwarted by the NRA lobby. How about the commitment to ban bump stocks?
455 2018-02-18 20:03:41 But it's not too late to take action. Ban the sale of assault rifles, bump stocks, armor piercing ammunition, limit amount of ammo sold. No fly No buy. It's a start.
456 2018-02-18 20:03:12 And bump stocks..?
457 2018-02-18 20:02:54 @aelfblockchain If my stocks could only perform like an ELF!!!
458 2018-02-18 20:02:26 Amy, if so many positions are vacant and department budgets are being slashed, where is all of our money going? I still can't believe that no one thought about that visit Mnuchin had to Fort Knox last summer. Things just don't add up for me. My background is finance & stocks.
459 2018-02-18 20:02:24 Can we talk about Vegas now? Bump Stocks are still legal in most States. #GunReformNow
460 2018-02-18 20:02:20 Anyone who supports 2A would be best served by being part of the solution instead of this petulant "but the 2nd A!!!!" argument. It's not constructive & thats why responsible gun owners are pro-universal background, close gun show loophole, gun permitting & ban bump stocks.
461 2018-02-18 20:02:14 How do you strengthen background checks?  What is the terrorist loophole?  I agree on banning bump stocks.
462 2018-02-18 20:01:17 Investing in RE, Stocks, ETF, bonds #2018 
463 2018-02-18 20:00:27 When are Politicians going to outlaw Auto Rifles and bump stocks to protect our children and citizens? I guess it is clear NRA money is more important than We the People...Wonder what founding fathers think?
464 2018-02-18 19:58:54 Ohhhh...I thought that AR-15s & bump-stocks were what our founding fathers had in mind. Thanks for clearing that up!

With regards to the drugs, women have been prescribed that type of crap for decades. It’s a real mystery why they didn’t turn into the monsters you seem to defend
465 2018-02-18 19:58:54 Mr. Trump, SEIZE THE MOMENT. This could be YOUR HOUR because gun lobby takes you seriously: PUSH for better enforcement of existing laws, better coordination btwn. federal/state/local law enforcement, ban on bump stocks, more thorough background checks, etc. ACT NOW & SAVE LIVES!
466 2018-02-18 19:58:32 That is an unfair blanket statement. Stronger background checks. Waiting periods. Close reseller loopholes. No-automatic weapons. No silencers/bump stocks.
Hunting/personal- fine. No need for the ridiculousness that’s available.
No-one can give a real reason
467 2018-02-18 19:57:40 So you're saying the bubble in stocks has a long way to go on the upside?
468 2018-02-18 19:56:38 Remember how dedicated they were to banning bump stocks after Las Vegas? It probably lasted until the next NRA check was delivered.
469 2018-02-18 19:56:20 Already true. Stocks for AR-15's increased sales the day of the shooting. Sad but true.

471 2018-02-18 19:55:22 None of your questions are about guncontrol, you went off on a tangent about bump stocks at one point, which I answered. I answered your questions about your fantasy war between me and you with guns and knives.

I'm starting to wonder if you know what a revolver is....
472 2018-02-18 19:55:13 NOW you think about other countries laughing their asses off?!  YOU have turned the U.S. into the laughing stocks of the world
473 2018-02-18 19:55:07 Like outlaw high capacity magazines, bump stocks, better background checks. I'm a gunowner. I want to keep them but we're gonna end up like Australia if we don't do something.
474 2018-02-18 19:54:29 As far as I know, no. I don’t believe trigger fingers or bump stocks should be legal.

482 2018-02-18 19:51:28 AMEN. Here's where Trump could LEAD, because a large part of his base is made up of gun rights advocates. ("Only Nixon could go to China.") President SHOULD use occasion to PUSH for better enforcement of existing laws, banning bump stocks & automatic weapons, etc. CARPE DIEM!
483 2018-02-18 19:51:04 Bumb-Stocks, thanks to Obama.
484 2018-02-18 19:51:00 Time to have a #GunMarch and tell @GOP @NRA what’s next:
-Thorough background check for all buyers everywhere
- No semi- automatic guns on the market
- No bumper stocks on the market
- No silencers on the market 

@NRA is a criminal organization
485 2018-02-18 19:50:05 Bumb-stocks, thanks to Obama
486 2018-02-18 19:49:04 might be more enticing if we can market penis enlargements as "bump stocks"
487 2018-02-18 19:49:00 There so many stocks that are oversold it crazy.

متى تعود السيولة وتتحسن الأسعار؟
هل تم حجز السيولة في الإكتتابات وزيادات رأس المال وتقييدها بعد إنخفاض الأسعار عن الكلفة؟
هل دخلت أسواقنا عملياً في مرحلة ركود؟
أم إنها مجرد عملية مكررة

490 2018-02-18 19:48:23 We need to nix the conceal carry line item on that bill.  It makes those of us with strict gun laws unsafe due to the risk of states with crappy laws like Florida, TX, etc.  We need universal gun laws, outlaw ARs, bump stocks, and large clips.
491 2018-02-18 19:47:20 Has anyone noticed...
One number keeps popping out in polls . . . 30's something!

@realDonaldTrump approval
% of voters voting for him
His base
% of americans who can afford to buy stocks & bonds

What message is this sending?
492 2018-02-18 19:46:56 Follow the money! guarantee you that some GOP lawmakers and possibly Trump family own shares in gun industry stocks.
493 2018-02-18 19:46:29 Diverse investment portfolios should have stocks and bonds that do not rise and fall at the same time #bonds #investsage #jamaica #etf
494 2018-02-18 19:45:51 If something good happens that was a direct result of him being the Pres (stocks, taxes) then it's fine for him to say, "our tax cuts" or "under my admin."
495 2018-02-18 19:45:12 Did you know? Walnut can also be used for quality joinery goods, musical instruments, gun stocks, rifle butts and architectural work.
496 2018-02-18 19:44:57 @realDonaldTrump   Why not ban military style automatic rifles, you have met NRA and Dems half way. Conservatives won’t miss bump stocks or auto fire guns for “five years” to see if these shootings stop. Add metal detectors at entrances and guards at schools also
497 2018-02-18 19:44:11 Pass background checks for the mentally ill, set up a new system to review these cases, restrict AR-15 sales, no bump stocks, no terrorist watch list people allowed to buy weapons, NO BRAINER !!!
498 2018-02-18 19:44:11 Do not give an inch to these #MarchForOurLives idiots and their favorite politicians. Any proposal short of totality is not enough. Don't forget: The GOP was willing to take action on bump stocks, but Democrats decided any bill had to include suppressors amongst other things.

504 2018-02-18 19:41:50 Then what common ground would my friends have— “I have to wait for Davis at my house all the time” “oh that’s nothing, I’ve had to wait for Davis at his house”
505 2018-02-18 19:41:43 This whole thread made my life honestly
506 2018-02-18 19:41:32 Then act. Come up with one law that will help. I’m not saying ban guns either. Start small & aim for limiting carnage. I’ll start the brainstorming: better checks for people with mental illness; limit ammunition; ban bump stocks. Now it’s your turn...
507 2018-02-18 19:41:21 Try crypto stocks. Day trading on the ups and downs. I'm $500 up in 2 weeks off only $1000 outlay. Sounds like a cliche advert i know but its relatively simple
508 2018-02-18 19:39:38 Ma mom picks would be gauthier or stocks for us. Lundvald for dundee
509 2018-02-18 19:38:53 Bump stocks are legal and convert a semi to an full assault weapon. Look at how much better other countries do! Allow public safety research which has been banned! Much more to do or schools wouldn’t be shot up every week in the USA!
510 2018-02-18 19:38:49 Hung out with a lot of hunters this weekend, old white guys. They all agreed bump stocks should be outlawed. Majority think AR 15 type guns need to be registered/ restrictive sales. Trump is losing support, “ crazy” is thier term for him.
511 2018-02-18 19:37:56 If you love your job already, don’t change it; build up passive income. Save an amount each month buy stocks/shares. Our caretaker does this and I’ve started following his advice. But you have to think long term.
512 2018-02-18 19:37:44 I can honestly say the @herbfed chook we’ve just eaten from @Campbells1868 is the best chicken I’ve ever eaten. Delicious! Is there anywhere in Suffolk that stocks your produce?
513 2018-02-18 19:37:17 Did the NRA save us from newTown? Columbine? Aurora? Las Vegas? Orlando?    No.  But they sure did make it easy for those crazies to get guns, as many as they wanted, and bump stocks.  Good old NRA
514 2018-02-18 19:35:45 I frankly don't trust you to legislate any aspect of weapons. You seem the type to suddenly consider all stocks unnecessary and want to ban collapsible stocks and pistol grips and thumbhole grips and pretty soon we'll be back to handcannons.
515 2018-02-18 19:35:28 yep. rate sensitive stocks will get pummeled in a yield spike - but will still perform in a recession/traditional risk-off because of that yield sensitivitiy
516 2018-02-18 19:35:07 I know there is a meet in the middle point. The bill that was repealed is part of common sense gun regulation. So are bum stocks, terrorist watch list and expanded background checks. You don't have to take away assault rifles to make a difference.
517 2018-02-18 19:35:01 Wall Street is a very expensive place to get educated. You may get "schooled." But what will you learn? #stocks #investing
518 2018-02-18 19:34:46 Ban AR15s. Ban them all. Ban bump stocks. Ban semi automatic weapons.  NO to the NRA.  Time for Change
519 2018-02-18 19:34:15 My God, gotta stop following u! Why can kids buy AR-15s but not booze, cigarettes or lotto tickets? Why r there still bump stocks? Why do Americans need an AR-15 to hunt? Stick with the NRA but the Youth will champion this without sensible adult support if need be!
520 2018-02-18 19:33:12 Bump stocks are stupid. Only a Clown would have one.
521 2018-02-18 19:33:05 Videos posted for you.  It's not just the "How to do something." It's the WHY do something. #stocks #investing
522 2018-02-18 19:32:54 I don't like the bump stocks
523 2018-02-18 19:32:42 But don’t touch those bump stocks.

527 2018-02-18 19:30:56 Like why did Congress let the assult weapons ban expire in 1994 & Obama sign in law the approval of bump stocks? What did  they think was going to happen?
528 2018-02-18 19:30:51 That's not individual freedom, unless you work in fishing. But anyway, fisheries are a tiny slice of the GDP pie & EU policy was reformed recently despite near zero attendance by UK rep (Farage). Major problem is fish stocks.

Also remind us how the Cod Wars worked out for the UK
529 2018-02-18 19:30:30 You make many excellent points.  Start with something simple like agreeing to do background checks, prevent people on no-fly and terrorist watch lists from buy guns.  Ban bump stocks.START WITH SOMETHING and evaluate..the problem didn’t arise overnight, the solution won’t either
530 2018-02-18 19:30:17 If this is really how people feel about semi-automatics, then what about starting with legislation on bump stocks. Citizens don't need bump fire stocks, is that something you would agree with?

532 2018-02-18 19:29:59 Public exposure and embarrassment is a highly effective form of punishment. Bring back stocks and place our criminals in full view of the public. A good old fashioned beating is a nice reinforcement of the punishment.
533 2018-02-18 19:29:47 Except those figures are based on stock price falls 7 days after breach announcement - and stocks generally bounce back within a month. Impact still significant but this is the wrong way to measure it.
534 2018-02-18 19:29:28 Thanks for letting us know :) I've passed this over to Store Manager to looking and increase the quality checks on current stocks to ensure this doesn't happen again. Sorry for any inconvenience caused - Madeeha
535 2018-02-18 19:28:34 Difficulty is IMO as much due to our legislators (both parties) taking huge amounts of money from gun lobby as much as anything else.

Even simple stuff - like banning bump stocks - won’t move as long as money says to carry on selling them.
536 2018-02-18 19:27:58 Lies. YOU rescinded #DACA. The WH-#CHUCKGRASSLEY Amendment on immigration received 39 votes. Duh, that means all Repubs didn’t support amendment. #LasVegas & #SutherlandSprings occurred when ALL 3 branches of govt are under Repub control & YOU couldn’t even repeal bump stocks.
537 2018-02-18 19:27:57 Hi @haagendazsuk 

I can’t find Chocolate Salted caramel Ice cream anywhere. It’s my fave and I’m having wisdom teeth surgery soon so all I want is a stock of this in my freezer for after. I can’t find a store in Aberdeen that stocks it. I’ve tried all local shops without luck
538 2018-02-18 19:27:17 Stop wasting time and energy supporting and accepting all this fuckery, get yours and pray your stocks keep going up.
539 2018-02-18 19:25:43 A good credit score, stocks to invest in, a nice ass car, a house paid in full & 3-4 businesses owned is what I’m interested in.
540 2018-02-18 19:25:09 #gun control. We can do some small things to move forward on gun violence. No semi automatics sold to those under 21. No bump-stocks sold. Congress. You can pass legislation on these small things, hurting no one. Why not do it?
541 2018-02-18 19:24:46 xtau laa..skrg ni ak focus dekat stocks je...aku tgh growth...so mslh ni ak letak tepi je...financial freedom dulu..sbb dr situ baru ak bole solve semua mslh skrg...
542 2018-02-18 19:23:53 Rise in Stocks as % of value under Obama was way more.

543 2018-02-18 19:23:26 @AnnCoulter Good time to buy gun stocks. The libtard agenda should drive some skyrocketing gun sales next week.
544 2018-02-18 19:22:43 @FoxNewsSunday  The NRA promotes gun safety, denounces bump stocks, and encourages gun registration and background checks. They do not promote gun violence. Everyone should be a member.
545 2018-02-18 19:21:52 @MaxBoot Everybody seems to forget about the "well-regulated militia" part of the 2nd Amendment. Also, our founding fathers were talking about single-shot muzzle loaders; not frigging assault rifles that can be jury-rigged with bump-stocks to fill the air with high-velocity metal
546 2018-02-18 19:21:03 @TechInterceptor where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
547 2018-02-18 19:20:59 Stocks, armazenamento bla bla
548 2018-02-18 19:20:13 Compared to how low Trump is getting unemployement and how high the stocks are, Obama didn't really do much.
Polls, I don't know much about that.

550 2018-02-18 19:19:00 Municiones cluster o de racimo no se fabrican en el Reino Unido. Quien diga eso está muy errado o quiere asignar culpa gratuitamente. Saudiés compraron tantas cuando británicos aún las fabricaban que tienen para seguir tirando un buen rato. Le compran a Brasil para reponer stocks
551 2018-02-18 19:18:51 With AR-15s modified with bump stocks, creating a virtual machine gun. No civilian needs an assault rifle.
552 2018-02-18 19:16:58 The chemical weapons were also destroyed. There is zero evidence any went to Syria. Some old stocks forgotten from 1991 were found, in an unusable condition. Also no biological weapons or facilities were found.
553 2018-02-18 19:16:21 Don’t get me wrong bump stocks are a fun toy. But using one is not easy and the front of the gun has to move for it to work. A bipod is meant to keep the mussel still. To come even close to the rate of fire in Vegas it would have to be a 200 round mag again impossible with bipod
554 2018-02-18 19:16:20 1. #NationalGunBuyBack
2. Ban semiautomatic rifles, bump stocks & large magazines
3. Make "smart gun" tech the new standard
4. Make all gun sales be done through a brokerage
5. Written approval from medical professionals
6. Hold vendors liable if illegal sale results in death.
555 2018-02-18 19:16:14 Getting back into trading and I'm loving it!  Reminds me of back in the 90's with the tech stocks!!!

557 2018-02-18 19:15:46 Probably there to discuss the new law he wants to pass banning assault weapons, bump stocks, high powered ammo and silencers.

559 2018-02-18 19:14:40 My local boss man now stocks like 10 different flavours of Fanta including peach, mango and pineapple and for that reason, he is the ultimate boss man
560 2018-02-18 19:14:13 1. Won't change anything. 2 Registration is impossible. 3 Registration is impossible. 4. Won't change anything (see Va Tech). 5. Bump stocks are irrelevant. You can bump fire a rifle without any modification. 6.Cranks, irrelevant. No one uses them in crimes to date. 7. Why?
561 2018-02-18 19:13:56 Wake up NO ONE needs AR-15 or military weapons and Bump stocks
562 2018-02-18 19:13:53 First, no one ever ever said take away all guns.   So you can calm down     We want sensible laws like more background checks, longer waiting period, mandatory classes, flags for gun owners such as domestic abuser or mentally ill, ban on bump stocks just to start, is that crazy

565 2018-02-18 19:12:44 What purpose other than killing multiple people in a quick succession do bump stocks have in our society?
566 2018-02-18 19:11:46 Right.  "Due process details."  I'm not sure about your first point.  The @NRA had a statement after Vegas with some support for a ban on bump stocks.
567 2018-02-18 19:11:31 real? or fake stocks?
568 2018-02-18 19:10:57 Agree Bump Stocks are wrong, get rid of them!  @SenBillNelson needs to earn our vote. Self education is absolutely required when it comes to gun regulations. He has not! @marcorubio @RepWebster
569 2018-02-18 19:10:31 Bump stocks are a non issue used by our media to push "gun control." I will listen to my son who is an expert over someone on Twitter purportedly from the UK. You barely have enough real information to participate in the conversation.
570 2018-02-18 19:10:06 Soooo you mean a useless ass 43 studying stocks and markets makes you a pro with crypto some how? Old man you time has past now just go enjoy your wealth and let the next gen show you how its done.
571 2018-02-18 19:09:48 Your wrong. Repub were all for banning bump stocks, but as usual Dems added hundreds of other bills into that one. NRA was for banning them as well. Dems do what they do best "resist"
572 2018-02-18 19:09:35 Hope you are right. But 20 first graders were slaughtered at Sandy Hook and nothing happened. After Las Vegas they didn’t even ban bump stocks. The gun advocates are in control and the 2nd amendment prevents reasonable people from doing anything about it.
573 2018-02-18 19:09:02 #MarchForOurLives Here is why the NRA is against ALL gun regs. using the "slippery slope" argument. As if banning gun stocks would kill the 2nd amend. The reason is that once the statistics come back & the trend line begins moving down, they can't argue gun control doesn't work.
574 2018-02-18 19:08:52 Get rid of bump stocks as they are nothing but a novelty.  Harsher punishments for offenders.  Maybe implement a tax stamp for AR platformed rifles making them more expensive?
575 2018-02-18 19:08:40 That was not an ar15. They said he had bump stock ars in his house but never said what he used. Look into that closer. Whatever he used was military and belt fed. Besides the guns they showed had bipods. Bipods and bump stocks don’t play well together
576 2018-02-18 19:08:12 Not so. They just want common sense gun laws. At the time of the 2nd Amendment, there were muskets--not AR-15's outfitted with bump stocks & lg magazines. Big difference. Two shot rifle, 7 mag semi-automatic pistol, background checks, req'd training to use/carry. Reasonable.
577 2018-02-18 19:08:07 Every house gets a revolver and shells. Your castle is now protected. That gun doesn’t leave the house, EVER. Unless the issue is bigger toys? 
No large capacity mags, bump stocks, and some real background checks. No gun show exemptions. No vague loopholes. A NATIONAL database.
578 2018-02-18 19:07:52 Hopefully he’ll unload all of his pharmaceutical stocks also.  Big Pharma has been pumping poison into our bodies for decades. Every mass shooter has been on psychotropic medications.  The side effects are far worse than the alleged benefits.
579 2018-02-18 19:07:39 And if you really want to run on the “Good guy with a gun” myth, I personally would rather go against a madman with chlorine gas or a knife than a modified semi-auto that’s gussied up to the point it’s fully auto I.E. bump stocks.
580 2018-02-18 19:07:32 The way pdxp got shutdown every investor in stocks better be worried! False accusations and pdxp is shutdown!! Terrible what your doing regulators, go after proven facts!
581 2018-02-18 19:06:51 Background checks, closing the gun show loopholes, not being able to purchase guns if you are mentally ill or on an FBI watch list (Pulse shooter), a limit on firearms owned (Vegas) and restricting ARs and bump stocks to military use only. Just common sense gun laws
582 2018-02-18 19:06:36 We want more than bump stocks banned. There needs to be a ban on all assault rifles. Period.
583 2018-02-18 19:03:51 Traditional investments?? Maybe property but certainly NOT stocks, no thanks. I'll stick with my version of traditional cryptos... BTC and ETH

585 2018-02-18 19:01:35 I’d also ban bump stocks, high-capacity magazines... well basically bring back the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 and amend and upgrade it. I’d have our government take note of how the EU and Australia handle gun control and enforce similar laws.
586 2018-02-18 19:01:26 You always talk about momentum trading.. can you please tell me how to identify momentum stocks? What are the technical indicators to be used?
587 2018-02-18 19:01:08 OK.
1st. show me a tweet where he didn't claim credit.
2nd. People criticize him for saying Obama did nothing for stocks/jobs when that's not true. For claiming his job figures are better than Obama, when it's not true.
For saying polls were false for Obama, now touting them
588 2018-02-18 19:00:14 SB196 automatic weapons ban; SB838 close background check; SB1476 gun registry; SB456 ban bump stocks; and SB530 risk protection orders. #HearTheBills
589 2018-02-18 18:59:52 Yeah? So he’s going back and sign an executive order banning semi-automatic guns and bump-stocks? I won’t hold my breath........
590 2018-02-18 18:59:39 It’s not acceptable that AR-15 and bump stocks are still being sold. The FBI is doing their job in impossible circumstances. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #NeverAgain
591 2018-02-18 18:59:20 It's time to:  1.) Ban "assault guns".   Get it done.  There are plenty of other "fun guns" and this one is not necessary.   2.) Raise the purchase age to 21...preferably, 25.  Allow minds to mature.  3.) What in the heck are you doing about BUMP STOCKS and why not?
592 2018-02-18 18:58:43 Most stocks in that space are all overbought except WWD
593 2018-02-18 18:58:29 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the Florida shooting.
594 2018-02-18 18:58:27 It takes 3 weeks to do a background check, why is 3 years going to make a difference?ive already showed you why banning AR-15s and bumb stocks wont work, i could agree with outlawing high capacity magazines, if i hear the agruement....
595 2018-02-18 18:57:51 I called Rep. Barbara Comstock's office yesterday to express concern with the recent shooting and past Congressional inaction.  Asked what was done re bump stocks since 10/17 shooting.  Response was a letter to BTF.  Underwhelming.
596 2018-02-18 18:57:43 So more gun laws or nah? It's simple, are you for stiffer background checks? Longer waiting periods? Closing the gun show loopholes? Changing the age to be able to purchase an AR-15? Getting rid of Bump stocks? What specific in regards to gun safety are you for, before we get to
597 2018-02-18 18:56:41 Lay a gem on y’all go to the StockMaster App an invest 100 on 2 stocks thats bout to Blow up and thank me Later
598 2018-02-18 18:56:35 Ex) Stocks rising. He can simply tweet out good news about stocks going up, without a single "I" or "my" in it and people critize him for taking credit. Don't blame the man for trying to announce good news.
599 2018-02-18 18:56:33 I think you are missing the point I didn't say we should ban guns in America not all guns just the AR-15 and the bump stocks what is so confusing about that and why is it always when someone mentions guns it's like we want to take them away untrue
600 2018-02-18 18:56:20 You’re damn right I want assault rifles, bump stocks and other military style weaponry out of the hands of all citizens. Sorry not sorry.
601 2018-02-18 18:55:03 First off Bernie, those "bump stocks" were never proven to be used. Secondly you are not listening to the American people. We will not hand over our guns b/c  you government people say we should, that is a dictatorship. The R's are listening, it is you D's that refuse to listen.
602 2018-02-18 18:54:42 I want automatic weapons off the street and away from mental challenged, criminals and our children. Bunk stocks or anything similar should also be outlawed. No reason, not one for these to be available to private citizens
603 2018-02-18 18:54:29 Not true. I proposed the same things that have been proposed before. Tighter background checks, no sales to under 21, no ar 15’s, no bump stocks, no high capacity magazines, etc. I’m sure you don’t agree with any of these or even considering them.
604 2018-02-18 18:53:43 I’m sure you’re right, but it does seem like that argument keeps rolling & growing until you end up with bump stocks and AR15’s. There’s genuinely no need for a gun in civilised society - in Britain people just don’t have them and we don’t feel afraid.
605 2018-02-18 18:53:25 There is a difference between Military AR15 and what we can purchase AR15 Style. @SenBillNelson stated FL shooter used Automatic. Just for kicks, go to a gun store try to buy Automatic Weapon. Dem Sens wanted more than bump stocks banned.
606 2018-02-18 18:53:25 Be bold; ban ALL assault-style weapons and bump stocks, close gun show loophole, prohibit anyone on terror list or with psych problem to buy a gun, fund CDC research on gun violence, fund mental health & allow civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
607 2018-02-18 18:53:20 If you find them, I need XXL!
608 2018-02-18 18:52:15 Why can’t individual bills be created to address violence issues? I.e. 1 for high capacity magazines, 1 for bump stocks, 1 for mental health, 1 for access to guns, etc. No one action will stop all but we can start slowing it.
609 2018-02-18 18:52:06 Meanwhile you do nothing except bully people on twitter.  Why do you remove regulations that prevented mentally ill people from buying guns?  Why have you not done anything about bump stocks?  You are a liar and a bully #ImpeachTrump #LIAR #GunControl
610 2018-02-18 18:51:27 Fauji food (Nurpur milk producer)  stocks will hit upper lock tomorrow #PSX #KSE #LSE #Trading
611 2018-02-18 18:50:45 I’d add; age restrictions, ban assault weapons, bump stocks, close gun show loophole and exhaustive background checks. This is not a 50-50 issue; majority of Americans want these things. Elected officials need to deliver on this and reject NRA hardline stance.
612 2018-02-18 18:50:18 tell me what the total tax take from your ageing, depleting oil and gas stocks were last year? Do you even know
613 2018-02-18 18:49:42 Era re easy eso, 5 stocks por aca 3 por aca unas letras un cc y listoli
614 2018-02-18 18:49:17 We should all agree to ban rapid firing assault rifle‘s. Bump stocks too. We should enforce current gun laws, close secondary loopholes at gun shows, & stop the legal sale of guns on the Internet. We should all agree to have our politicians stop taking money from the NRA, RUBIO
615 2018-02-18 18:48:34 Unite in peace (mindful attitude). U can still buy guns but responsibly "Wait times" (screening/courses/rules), restrict age 18+,in purchase process. Bump stocks s/be illegal/prohibited, no civilian use military assault guns, no o/carry (transport permit)
616 2018-02-18 18:48:34 NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ENOUGH, MITCH !! 
ARs & SEMI-ARs, BUMP STOCKS NEED TO BE OUTLAWED. How a flag is flown DOES NOTHING! NOTHING! WHAT A JOKE!
617 2018-02-18 18:48:21 I assumed its hard because it’s not in effect. There isn’t anything particularly special about an AR-15. I’m all for banning bump stocks and I believe some communities are. I also favor institutionalizing folks with mental problems. That would help too.
618 2018-02-18 18:47:41 I'm a independent that owns a AR and other weapons. We should ban Bump stocks, require a much stiffer background checks and eliminate large capacity magazines. Also raise the limit to 21 and maybe classes and licenses for this grade of weapon. I think that's a good compromise.
619 2018-02-18 18:47:41 other countries have psychos but they don't have very eay access to assault weapons. 
Plus it isn't an either or situation. Can improve mental health and not have assault weapons, bump stocks, and large magazines floating around.
620 2018-02-18 18:47:28 Oh so now we’re talking bump stocks? They can make bump stocks illegal for all I care. By the point is that an AR15 without any kind of modification like the bump stock is no more deadly than any other semi automatic gun.
621 2018-02-18 18:46:40 CNN will be sold before trump leave white house The question is for how much sell all stocks of CNN fast fire sale coming soon
622 2018-02-18 18:46:17 The economy is doing what it has been doing thx to Obama pulling us out of the Great Recession & the SM only effects the top since 84% of all stocks are owned by 3%’ers! Wages are not up bc of the tax-scam-debunked & went up less than last year, unemployment has been down, —> 1:4
623 2018-02-18 18:46:00 there is no correlation between stocks and crypto, that s why cryptos are a good portfolio diversifier so cut the BS

625 2018-02-18 18:44:22 The Right Honorable Damien Hinds (secretary for education) and Jeremy Hunt (secretary for health and social care) should be put in Stocks in front of Norwich City Council @EmmaBro67457844 ! Seen the news anybody? Eejits.
626 2018-02-18 18:44:10 Very few advocate outright bans. Just reasonable sensible regulations. AR-15s and similar semi-automatic weapons do not belong in the hands of civilians. Along with silencers, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, high velocity ammo, body armour.
627 2018-02-18 18:43:35 It's a hard law to pass in the states because the gun industry is a billion dollar industry. And I for one never said to take your guns away. It's limit firearms like the AR15, ban bump stocks and get everyone who wants to buy a gun. How is that hard? It's common sense.
628 2018-02-18 18:43:15 Horse pucky.  Simply ban all semi automatics and bump stocks.  See we do have a simply solution.. Confiscate any found and have a nationwide turn in.
629 2018-02-18 18:42:47 No one plausible is suggesting a right be taken, just a gun type & some modifications like bump stocks be prevented from public sale. I grew up with guns & have no issue with sport shooting/hunting but the AR shouldn’t be sold to the public.But if u own one no one should take it.
630 2018-02-18 18:42:22 Dips?  You mean the largest losses in stock market history?  Corporations are artificially keeping their stock prices high by buying back their own stocks.  It's only a matter of time before it implodes.
631 2018-02-18 18:42:22 Already are what? There are no bans on assault rifles right now. There are no bans on bump stocks right now. And Congress is considering legalizing silencers. You have your facts wrong if you think these things are already banned.
632 2018-02-18 18:42:11 You dont need to trade every single day. If you are a swing trader and you trade every single day, there is a problem. Sometimes the best thing to do is to stay out of the market. Take a break, relax and only took great opportunities, that is how you win. #trading #stocks #sunday
633 2018-02-18 18:41:22 2) A thorough background check, including domestic violence reports, mental health issues, 3) minimum firearm safety classes, 4) minimal firearm hands-on refresher training, 5) ban on bump stocks, 6) new ban on assault rifles similar the the 1994 ban. /2
634 2018-02-18 18:41:07 #FakePresidentFacts
The president would rather paint the White House with the blood of THOUSANDS of children than pass a single gun reg, like, for example, banning bump stocks. 

I'm sorry, that one's not fake. It's a motherfucking fact.
635 2018-02-18 18:40:35 What about Bump stocks stupid
636 2018-02-18 18:40:34 What CNN fails to tell you is that China has taken over the US economy. Look at the two richest people in the world. one stocks 97% of his Amazons shelves with "Made In China" goods and the other one uses slave labor in China.
637 2018-02-18 18:38:09 I don't know if money can be made in stocks. Everyone says its gambling and luck. At least I am trying and slowly will find my way to the secret. Losses are a part of life and that's when success will be tasted.
638 2018-02-18 18:35:52 No he didn't. He used big standard AR-15s with bump stocks. Totally legal.
639 2018-02-18 18:35:23 Actually they aren’t.  They are advertised as merely rifles.  And bump stocks don’t make them anything but inaccurate.
640 2018-02-18 18:34:50 I think I’m gonna start using Robin Hood for stocks too app seems dope @FlyingClutchman
641 2018-02-18 18:34:24 I agree. But new gun laws are required like banning bump stocks and maybe raising the legal age to buy a gun.
642 2018-02-18 18:34:02 Another retarde arguement for bullish stocks when $4T in CB stimulus on lifetime high debts (corp, given and personal) produces sub par growth on highest valuations ever now inflation won't hurt stocks.
643 2018-02-18 18:33:55 Haha.. Förstår den, men man behöver ju ha något att jobba med i sämre tider också. :) Tack för tipset om "How to make money in stocks" av O'Neil förresten, mycket nyttigt i den!
644 2018-02-18 18:32:52 True. Yet their main defining characteristic is shilling. SEC going after shillers is great, regardless of if shillers also invest, trade, or play the ukulele. BTW shilling stocks is illegal.
645 2018-02-18 18:32:34 Nobody is saying take away your guns! However,w do need BETTER gun laws..we need better background checks, better mental illness health care, no one should EVER be able to purchase bump stocks or AR-15, or any automatic weapon that shoots multiple times! We need common sense laws
646 2018-02-18 18:31:53 Almost all lithium stocks down 30% to 50% . They were not invisible from the market correction either . But the bottom is most definitely in
647 2018-02-18 18:31:49 Nobody wants to take away your freedom.  Don't believe the NRA pundits.  We just want to stop assault rifles, bump stocks and have more background checks, better laws.  Anything to help prevent mass shootings.

648 2018-02-18 18:31:47 @SenatorLankford @chucktodd Senator - Republicans have: Blocked a National Background Database- did Nothing in “bump stocks”- taken $$Tens Of Millions$$ fro the NRA- Failed to Renew Assault Weapon Ban- there is No Need for Battlefield Combat weapons 2B in the hands of America
649 2018-02-18 18:31:25 Always straight to the stupidest argument. But let’s have an honest conversation. BTW, where are we on bump stocks. If the definition of a automatic weapon is pulling the trigger once and it continues to fire, doesn’t that attachment result in a fully automatic weapon.
650 2018-02-18 18:30:18 Somebody obviously invested in drone stocks.....
651 2018-02-18 18:29:37 Yeah those rights would be "eroded".   The "guns" of the Second Amendment are military grade weapons - bump stocks and all - appropriate for SHOOTING DOWN "Deep State" conspiracies.  The answer is ending government corruption and HANGING TRAITORS, not removing the Constitution.

654 2018-02-18 18:28:12 Dude maybe look at yours and masersti pile of shit. What stocks did u guys call again ? Bahaha
655 2018-02-18 18:27:30 Munger is a legend.. but it's surprising he didn't put bitcoin in their "too difficult to understand" bucket (like they do with most tech stocks) rather than publicly denouncing it
656 2018-02-18 18:26:42 Oh I can't remember the name they are still around see  their ads in GUNS magazine I also bought a few A3 kits from SARCO back when always had to refinish the stocks but they were like 279 I think.

658 2018-02-18 18:25:43 They are working on bum stocks, BTW, if you’re not aware Obama admin had decided not to ban. Facts matter.
659 2018-02-18 18:24:54 I would like to put her in stocks and do like a national travel show. Hell we could use the Trump Train and hit all the towns big and little.
660 2018-02-18 18:24:51 Ignoring individual state law, its extremely difficult to get even a pre-1986 machine gun bc of both extensive background checks and sheer price, also getting an FFL requires state and local zoning approval. Yet slide fire stocks mimic machine guns w/out the hassel of buying one.
661 2018-02-18 18:24:20 Good point , yet do we need assault rifles? Isn't a gun enough to protect yourself? Should bump stocks and/or military style assault rifles be available to every Tom, Dick and Harry ? Enough is enough !
662 2018-02-18 18:24:15 I was told I need a bigger picture of my fb profile picture. I guess I have to take a bigger picture and upload it. Is it anew thing with facebook? I need to hurry up. I miss reading Wall Street, especially the stocks.
663 2018-02-18 18:22:59 They worked quite well in Las Vegas where spray fire killed and wounded scores of people. Do you have issues with reality?  Bump stocks have NO PLACE in civilian society. Want to shoot a submachine gun. Join the Army.
664 2018-02-18 18:22:08 What are the other remaining 4 stocks out of 8 identified? Any tgt price n time span also suggested pls .. respect and regards.. tarun bansal
665 2018-02-18 18:21:54 No one at this point is calling for a gun ban. Assault rifles yes, bump stocks yes, automatic guns yes. We aren’t fighting a revolution, you do not need an assault rifle to hunt! Except wanting your kill ratio as high as you kill innocent ppl.
666 2018-02-18 18:21:53 I’m not going to take away everyone’s guns. Your ignorance tells you that’s what people want. Your innate fear of being without your weapons is creating more fear than necessary. Things need to change, not taking away everything. Bump stocks, only one example.
667 2018-02-18 18:21:31 Stocks reservoir in Bowland Forest..good long walk..muddy today though
668 2018-02-18 18:20:50 Correct but if you want actual bills proposed, how about the bill to prevent people on No Fly List from buying guns. How about bill to make bump stocks illegal.
669 2018-02-18 18:20:46 No... I know what I'm talking about. You are like the 4th person this morning I've had a debate with. All the leftist say ban assault rifles ban bump stocks, ban ar 15s. And your comment was linking low gun volume to low school shootings. All ive been saying is to go about this
670 2018-02-18 18:19:54 into stocks... =(( but broke
671 2018-02-18 18:19:30 Allowing gun violence data to be collected and studied, banning bump stocks and assault weapons, lower magazine capacities.
#gunsense #GunReformNow
672 2018-02-18 18:19:14 1/"Out, damned spot! out, I say!" Alas, the blood will not wash off. Congress will have bloody hands till they break from the grip of the NRA & legislate to ban military-style assault weapons, bump stocks, and any firearm that shoots more than 6 rounds without reloading.
673 2018-02-18 18:18:48 Close the gun show loophole then and regulate private sales? Ban bump stocks. Hell, even the NRA wanted to regulate bump stocks after Vegas then went quiet.

Global equities and commodities creep higher, though US stocks pared gains on  Russia-related announcements; NZD slips back below 0.7400.
676 2018-02-18 18:17:02 1. A banks ability to lend is only constrained by the number of creditworthy customers.
2. Government overspending can cause booms but  it's the private sector that over creates.
3. Nothing beats chips, healthier than fresh fruit.
4. The sectoral balkances are flows not stocks.
677 2018-02-18 18:16:58 Bump stocks were not used. Would 29 round mags be okay? 25 is okay until 25 year old kills, then what? 30? 50? 70? Infringing on the Rights of millions under the auspices of good intentions resulted in millions dying many times in recent history.
678 2018-02-18 18:16:54 Armalite rifle the company that makes it. And have you ever seen a bump stock? Horribly inaccurate novelty item nothing more. Just imagine trying to aim with everything moving an inch. Bump stocks are less than useless
679 2018-02-18 18:16:18 I'm on board with getting rid of bump stocks
680 2018-02-18 18:15:11 It is about bump stocks, it is about high-capacity magazines, it is about not researching gun violence, and on. It’s a multifaceted problem and the GOP will not take one step forward. None of the actions above restricts anyone’s right to own a gun.
681 2018-02-18 18:15:03 BS.  You take NRA contributions. Double talk w/o action leaves our children at risk. Where was your action on bump stocks after LV? You carefully say so little and do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
682 2018-02-18 18:14:20 The problem isn't with any of your above restrictions. The problem is the LEFT keeps talking outright bans on gun ownership. Just read through today's tweets. How does one believe they will stop with military style weapons, bump stocks, etc.?
683 2018-02-18 18:13:29 Semi automatic weapons and accessories like bump stocks
684 2018-02-18 18:12:49 Precisely sir. The stocks should not be worth more than 100crores. If they had this much stock, then they could have either pledged their stocks against credit or liquidate and closed part of the loans.
685 2018-02-18 18:12:44 Shit crazy cuz I sold stocks so it was 25 pages of transactions
686 2018-02-18 18:12:11 3. Deliberately postponing indictments, waiting for major planned False Flag attack to occur.

With US economy on the brinks of collapse (Stocks, Bonds, Dollar, Real Estate and Retail bubbles about to pop).
Trump will be taking the blame.

I therefore put my money on #3.
687 2018-02-18 18:10:55 BS go back look at the pictures of the shooting in Vegas and not one of the guns had Bump stocks on them. And an AR15 is not to Blame
688 2018-02-18 18:09:42 Rich have others working for them to continue being rich past times a business, now playing stocks and exchanges for them.
689 2018-02-18 18:09:40 There is nothing wrong with bump stocks, they just need to be held by the good people.
690 2018-02-18 18:09:20 Good for you, I hope you help make gun control happen. Access to guns is too easy and laws are varied across states with no consistency in terms of age and background checks. ARs and bump stocks need to be banned!
691 2018-02-18 18:09:18 Come on. Adjustable stocks are clearly feminist.
692 2018-02-18 18:08:51 Remember when we were all concerned with bump stocks?
693 2018-02-18 18:07:56 Will #AZ08 candidates @DebbieLesko @SteveMontenegro, @PhilLovas embrace NRA money or support full ban on assault style weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers & gun ownership for all convicted violent felons and mentally ill in AZ. #EnoughIsEnough #2A
694 2018-02-18 18:07:14 I have no experience with bump stocks, just submachine guns. ATF was supposed to be looking at putting bump stocks under the restrictikns of the NFA of 1934 and the GCA of 1968. But Sessions has not moved in this. I would SUPPORT restrictions or bans on bump stocksg
695 2018-02-18 18:07:00 @TGowdySC The problem is that ANYONE can own an AR-15!! Hunt with them? Really!! Outlaw bump stocks & AR-15s because there is NO excuse for public use of these things. Please review how Australia solved their gun problem & stopped mass shootings. It can & HAS been done.
696 2018-02-18 18:05:51 Schumer you could’ve even help get bump stocks banned.  That would have been something to shut that people matter more to you than your agenda. Don’t think more a moment some of us have forgotten what you were like in your opinions were in the past!
697 2018-02-18 18:05:34 Look, you putz, by definition the only thing that differentiates an AR15 from an "assault rifle" is the rate of fire. Which can be overcome with bump stocks and other legal mods. It was a gun designed for military use. Stop attacking the straw man.
698 2018-02-18 18:03:45 Nice rifle. Don’t allow mentally ill to have access. No bump stocks or banana clips. Make sure it’s sold to people who are 21. Require gun safety training and that it be kept secured. Register it. Create a COMPUTERIZED national registry for gun trace records.

700 2018-02-18 18:03:36 Then why has an AR-15 been used in all the worst shootings?? No one needs that gun, no one needs bump stocks.
We are not the only culture that glorifies violence, we are the only culture that has a mass shooting problem. Your arguments don’t work. #GunReformNow
701 2018-02-18 18:03:12 @ChuckGrassley Senator ask time you talk to the NRA tell them you will end bump stocks and assure mentally disturbed people can't buy guns!! You work for us.

703 2018-02-18 18:02:01 Time to ask @SteveMontenegro if he will support a full ban on assault style weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers & gun ownership for all convicted violent felons in Arizona or nationwide...or is he just another one of those "thoughts and prayers" candidates?

707 2018-02-18 18:01:20 This is an unconscionable action by Trump to send to Congress a budget which cuts millions of dollars from the gun background check system. The people want a stronger system in place, not a weaker one. The people also demand a ban on assault weapons & bump stocks!!
708 2018-02-18 18:01:19 Time to ask @DebbieLesko if she will support a full ban on assault style weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers and gun ownership for all convicted violent felons in Arizona or nationwide...or is she just another one of those "thoughts and prayers" candidates?
709 2018-02-18 18:01:18 I’m advocating for better gun laws. All that’s happened is gun law loosening. Not a single gun law has been passed in years. Not even against bump stocks or high capacity magazine. Are you advocating for no gun laws?
710 2018-02-18 18:01:10 As a Canadian I've never had to worry about sending my kids to school like Americans do. We don't have this gun problem here. I don't see the need for an average person to have military style guns, bump stocks, 30 round mags or 600 rounds a minute guns.
711 2018-02-18 18:01:08 So what's your plan, dude?  Let's hear some concrete ideas, not silly rhetoric. How about you quit taking money from the NRA so you aren't beholden to them and can propose real laws to ban bump stocks and assault weapons, etc.
712 2018-02-18 18:00:19 He is absolutely correct. Democrat talking points about bump stocks, magazine sizes, "assault weapon" bans, is not doing ANYTHING to prevent the next shootings. ANY, emotionally generated, "law" will either be ineffective, or simply ignored, as the ones currently on the books.
713 2018-02-18 18:00:02 AAAAAND Woe is currently in the stocks to be hanged, so I got about a week to plan an escape or they'll Never be Able To Kiss (help me)
714 2018-02-18 17:59:50 We need to restrict bump stocks!
Mob: MENTAL HEALTH! We need to restrict hi- capacity magazines! Mob: MENTAL HEALTH! We need to restrict rate of fire for these weapons! Mob: MENTAL HEALTH!
715 2018-02-18 17:59:25 but huge upside left in these stocks? (going by twitter chatter)
716 2018-02-18 17:59:08 Don't need a reason, it's just stuff... I don't really care about bump stocks, but what about the man pulling the trigger? What are you doing to stop him from acting on evil thoughts?
717 2018-02-18 17:57:52 Both rain industries and bhansali engineering are great stocks to have.. Its just matter of time both will give heavy returns in coming years.
718 2018-02-18 17:57:51 So it's not cool when you buy "immoral" stocks like tabaco/guns/alcohol and such. Does me shorting such stocks make me a hero?
719 2018-02-18 17:57:45 Yep! It’s the same with gun stocks. $$$ drives this whole thing.
720 2018-02-18 17:57:17 And I feel that has a lot to do w/the automatic & consistent payroll deduction into retirement plans where fund managers just throw it into the market pushing stocks and valuations higher & higher. Any setback & of course the next recession, will be v/painful due to the excesses.
721 2018-02-18 17:56:15 No reason for bump stocks none. No reason for a civilian to have a weapon that fires more than 8-10 shells.  Come on.
722 2018-02-18 17:56:10 "Out, damned spot! out, I say!" Alas, the blood will not wash off. You'll have virtual blood on your hands until you break out of the grip of the NRA & legislate to ban military-style assault weapons, bump stocks, and any firearm that shoots more than 6 rounds without reloading.
723 2018-02-18 17:56:08 They never approved bump stocks....typical lie
724 2018-02-18 17:56:03 Amazing... considering the reality of what happened in #LasVegasShooting... it's pretty pathetic... the US Congress... can't even ban fucking bump-stocks... that pretty well defines the GOP/NRA position... no need to wonder, if they're going to 'pivot' and start making sense...
725 2018-02-18 17:55:49 Bump stocks are cool too!!!!!
726 2018-02-18 17:55:22 Hello republican control all three and chips couldn't even pass and everyone  agreed and same with bump stocks. Who has complete power? Didn't 45 say don't vote HrC they trying to take your guns away.
727 2018-02-18 17:53:52 If you've bought the jacket from one of our Outlet stores, Doug it would need to be returned to an Outlet branch. Because our Outlet stores carry old season stocks, we don't hold accurate stock figures for each branch. 1/2
728 2018-02-18 17:53:27 Guess what gun stocks do every time you post this....
729 2018-02-18 17:53:15 With pink stocks
730 2018-02-18 17:52:52 If there trying to revive the whole KKK attitude can we not revive public tar & feathering? Maybe the stocks?
731 2018-02-18 17:52:03 forgive my ignorance !
excessive neomania & neophytism both seem inappropriate, but that is besides the point :)

issue was how does sticking to stocks for 10-15 years rhyme with millenia-surviving things/concepts !!

better we drop it..
732 2018-02-18 17:51:48 Remember bump stocks?
733 2018-02-18 17:51:09 As a mainly dividend investor, made from predominately high market cap stocks, what portfolio yield should one expect? Overall, entire portfolio I’m 1.8% focus on banks and utilities, not REITs. @CdnCouchPotato
734 2018-02-18 17:51:03 America is call BS on "the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is  a good guy with a gun."  A) it is Not the only way. B) not actually A way. Now is the time. Ban assault weapons, close loop holes, ban bump stocks, complete background checks. If it takes a month, so be it
735 2018-02-18 17:49:50 NO SILENCERS, NO BUMP STOCKS, No Cross Country Concealed CARRY!
736 2018-02-18 17:49:24 Just word Senator?  Take action.  Stop taking NRA funding. Help develop and pass a law for more sensible gun control.  There is no place in our society for semi-auto rifles, 30 bullet mags or bump stocks. No more hollow words. Be the American hero you are.
737 2018-02-18 17:49:23 The social contract of government is based on The People giving their consent to be governed in exchange for less freedom. When there is a choice btwn Constitutional right to life and ownership of rapid fire guns & automation of guns w/bump stocks, why is there any hesitation?
738 2018-02-18 17:49:05 Why are you crying invest in stocks and quit trying to get a hand out the welfare demorats are out get a job and work for your money it won’t kill you
739 2018-02-18 17:49:02 No such thing as "assault weapon" except in media and military so hard to ban. Tried once already and I think GAO or some agency could find no effect. Ban bumper stocks for sure only good for lots of bullets out fortunately terrible accuracy but in a crowd terrible
740 2018-02-18 17:48:22 The 2nd Amendment does not guarantee the possession of semi-automatic military style weapons, bump stocks, etc.
Weapons of mass destruction are the weapons only the military should have.
741 2018-02-18 17:48:08 Let's hope I make the ryt calls on stocks 
742 2018-02-18 17:46:48 "Marxism is no longer relevant because any proletarian can buy stocks and own capital"
743 2018-02-18 17:46:27 This is the change we need:
Ban assault weapons
Ban bump stocks 
No gun shows 
Mandatory training 
Mandatory liability insurance 
National gun registry 
Private sales have to be reported to authorities 
No sales to domestic abusers
Ammunition limits 
#GunControlNOW
744 2018-02-18 17:45:29 Except the ATF didn't really approve them so much as say that the law didn't allow the ATF to regulate the stocks. Congress couldn't be bothered to act.
745 2018-02-18 17:45:13 And bump stocks?
746 2018-02-18 17:44:43 It's not about "thoughts and prayers" as a distraction. It's thinking "thoughts and prayers" is a sufficient response. Dems have been pushing, nothing gets passed. Case in point: banning bump stocks after Vegas. No brainer but couldn't get through.
747 2018-02-18 17:44:37 Then stand up and be a real leader. If you really care, then take action to keep this from happening again. Care more about people than being re-elected. Start with regulating AR-15s & bump stocks. NOW.
748 2018-02-18 17:44:35 What were his quotes about bump stocks, which never saw a fix after Las Vegas? Words don’t mean a thing without action.
749 2018-02-18 17:44:13 Late-Capitalism, American style -
where the gun industry is SO powerful, with its lobby holding SUCH a complete stranglehold on government, that mass school shootings are so commonplace we don't even blink, and Congress won't even begin to try to ban fucking BUMP-STOCKS!!
750 2018-02-18 17:43:12 Hey this is what he does. He stocks, chases, and puts down his opponents. Regardless of who
751 2018-02-18 17:43:10 NEOGEN PACT stocks rallying
752 2018-02-18 17:42:48 We will see
Vegas? Bump stocks...people lose steam until the next massacre
Bullet-proof school backpacks are selling well...kevlar, lightweight, discreet
753 2018-02-18 17:42:23 1. Bump stocks don't actually modify the rifle.
2. The sicko in LV had been planning it for a long time.
3. If guns had not been available, he would have found some other way that might have produced even more casualties.
4. So, your answer is disarming the law abiding.

756 2018-02-18 17:41:03 We need more than piecemeal gun legislation.  We need comprehensive gun reform—not just bans on bump stocks, better background checks, or bans on assault weapons.  The whole subject needs to be comprehensively modified.  First step, refuse all NRA blood money. #NRABloodMoney
757 2018-02-18 17:40:52 wool or a mix between wool and acrylic (a lot of them are using acrylic right now bc of the recent drought but you can still find a lot made of wool while stocks last)
758 2018-02-18 17:40:29 Remember that after the Las Vegas shooting some GOP congressmen timidly said that they would look into banning bump stocks? 
How long did it last before the NRA clamped down on them?
Less than a week!!
759 2018-02-18 17:40:20 The best stocks are often the ones with the highest growth concensus estimate. So people will often trade of this estimate. That is why I call it concensus.
760 2018-02-18 17:40:13 Dear Congress: We need to regulate magazine capacity. If we just ban bump stocks, know that there are many other devices that can make guns (even hand guns) behave as fully auto. Shut down gun shows. They are too unregulated. Strengthen background checks.
761 2018-02-18 17:40:12 I’m going to do a segment on volume this week.  Can you name a few stocks you’d like me to use as examples?
762 2018-02-18 17:39:59 There is a major difference in the way they fire, hence the different terms. Heck, a .303 rifle is deadlier and fires just as quickly, if not more so. And no one is screaming to ban them. Probably because they have wooden stocks, and liberals are terrified of black rifles.

768 2018-02-18 17:37:52 I agree on straw buys and that there are other similar weapons that can be used. However, AR15s were used in the Vegas, Newton, Orlando & Texas mass shootings, as well as Parkland. Let's start w/ them for copycat mentality. Control high mags, drums, bump stocks, etc.
769 2018-02-18 17:36:48 Please tell Congress: We need to regulate magazine capacity, particularly high capacity. If we just ban bump stocks, know that there are several other devices that can make guns behave as fully auto. Shut down gun shows. They are too unregulated. Strengthen background checks.

772 2018-02-18 17:34:48 Well then lets get regulated. We aren't now. No AR 15's, No Bump stocks for civilians to purchase. Change the age laws to purchase any gun. No more NRA!! We did not NRA when these laws were written!!

774 2018-02-18 17:34:11 Our Constitution can be amended. We’ve been doing that since we ratified it. Do I care if people have regular rifles so they can hunt deer or whatever for food? No. But there is literally NO REASON that anyone needs to own an assault weapon, bump stocks, or anything like it.
775 2018-02-18 17:33:52 Dear Congress: We need to regulate magazine capacity. If you just ban bump stocks, please know that there are several other devices that can make guns behave as fully auto. Shut down gun shows. They are too unregulated. Strengthen background checks.

781 2018-02-18 17:31:16 Most likely it was the addition of the bump-fire stocks that prevented the LV shooter from killing more people. A more stable gun system would've been far easier to aim, for that particular shooting.

783 2018-02-18 17:30:10 I don't necessarily think the dow crashing will mean we have to sell our cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was introduced as a response to the 2008 crash, it's meant to be an alternative. When the stocks ultimately do crash, I think many people will look to crypto for security
784 2018-02-18 17:29:39 Well speaking in general terms, not stocks and bonds. What positive are you investing that's bringing a great impact in your life?

794 2018-02-18 17:25:38 Guns should be treated like a car, registered, insured, the gun, ammunition, accessories like bump stocks should all be put in this database. In addition,permits should be annual & you should have to do a physiological evaluation to renew your permit. All loopholes =closed
795 2018-02-18 17:25:22 no stocks used
796 2018-02-18 17:25:01 We should reverse the ban on the CDC conducting gun research, we should strengthen background checks, we should close the terrorist loophole, and we should ban bump stocks. But none of this will happen until we take the House or Senate back. Or both.
797 2018-02-18 17:24:16 Everyone is right. Guns don’t kill people, people do. More mental health services are needed. Etc., etc, etc. Given all that, what is the possible justification for allowing bump stocks, AR-15’s, and silencers to be sold to the general public?
798 2018-02-18 17:24:05 We need to regulate magazine capacity. If you just ban bump stocks, please know that there are several other devices that can make guns behave as fully auto. Shut down gun shows. They are too unregulated. Strengthen background checks.

867 2018-02-18 17:21:34 Really thinking on dropping $1200 on Tesla stocks
868 2018-02-18 17:20:53 One party wants these laws one does not
No sales by private owners
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban
Licenses for all arms
14 day waiting periods
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Child lock requirements
Assault rifle ban
Minimum age of purchase 21
869 2018-02-18 17:20:50 Notwithstanding bump stocks, which Trump won’t make illegal. And not counting easy modifications for “full auto.” Don’t kid a kidder, mkay?
870 2018-02-18 17:20:17 Right. Just like after the Las Vegas massacre. Congressional republicans did a LOT on bump stocks after that. Remember? No. Oh. You must ben an American, then.
871 2018-02-18 17:20:12 @RepComstock Rep. Comstock was are you plans for the 24th March.  I hope they are to march side by side with our youth and families to demand greater gun control.  Semi-automatic rifles, 30 bullet magazines and bump stocks have not place in our everyday lives.  Also no more NRA $
872 2018-02-18 17:19:48 Just like no issue with bump stocks?   Then nothing happens.  The proof is in the lack of action.
873 2018-02-18 17:19:26 Never buy individual stocks for this very reason. Index funds all the way!
874 2018-02-18 17:19:11 Why ban one semi-auto rifle, and leave an identically designed model on the streets? That stop crime? How? Why ban bump-stocks when the gov't can't enforce the law? Why require background checks on private sales when the gov't can track such sales? Feel good laws do not protect.

876 2018-02-18 17:19:00 ‘Gotta do something’ mentality!
Ban bump stocks “even though bump stocks were not used in the tragic event.”
877 2018-02-18 17:18:56 How many mass murders are committed with handguns vs semi automatic rifles? Most of the recent massacres were committed with SA rifles along with high capacity magazines (bump stocks in Vegas).

It isn’t about eliminating murder, it’s about reducing body counts when they happen.
878 2018-02-18 17:18:52 nice list.  Add no semi-auto, quasi-military rifles with large capacity mags and no bump stocks for anyone.
879 2018-02-18 17:18:12 All of this. Also, personally I’m for raising the age from 18 to 21 on semi auto centerfire rifles. That even includes those pretty wood stocks. Theres a legitimate discussion to be had in so many ways
880 2018-02-18 17:17:51 I disagree. Do you know why the market fell? It was because of the trillion dollar bet against volatility. Billions in stocks had to be liquidated in order for huge funds to cover their margin debt, which consequently caused algo overreactions. See you at $26K by early March.
881 2018-02-18 17:17:24 Yeah. Whenever there's mere mention of ANY gun control, NRA freaks out saying, "They're gonna take our guns!!" and gun manufacturer stocks and sales skyrocket.
882 2018-02-18 17:17:24 I sold stocks and there was 25 pages worth of transactions

887 2018-02-18 17:14:27 Let's ban assault rifles and bump stocks while we can.
888 2018-02-18 17:14:07 My dad was military @NRA gun nut so I grew up firing all kinds of guns at the police gun range. I have one handgun today. Arming schools is stupid. We need to BAN AR-15s, max 10 round clips, no silencers, no bump stocks, no grenades, PRUDENT GUN LAWS
889 2018-02-18 17:13:59 well, do you believe bump stocks for a semi-auto should be easily available to purchase by citizens?
890 2018-02-18 17:13:56 Oh and by the way confiscate Putin’s slush fund in us stocks and real estate owned by his proxy oligarchs via Global magnisky and tell the world leaders to do the same. Everywhere the cyber spies interferes in elections yahoo!
891 2018-02-18 17:13:47 Same people that reversed Obama policy that made it more difficult for mentally ill person to buy gun.

Same people that refuse to ban bump stocks when their only purpose is to make semi-auto weapon fire full-auto. The Las Vegas guy had one, his weapon fired like a machine gun.
892 2018-02-18 17:13:28 #ParklandSchoolShooting - #AmericanPublic take note - politicians are sidestepping real issue - an OUTRIGHT BAN  of assault style rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. Substituting gun "ban" with impotent term "control". #VoteThemOut2018
893 2018-02-18 17:12:15 If they didn't ban bump stocks, which would of been a "safe" action for them, then only a change in congress will fix this.
894 2018-02-18 17:12:14 And ban bump stocks.
895 2018-02-18 17:11:58 Price correlates w/inventories vs theoretical production capacity. The larger variable is OPEC success in controlling WW stocks over time. OPEC is better off as a whole selling less at higher prices. E&P investment will be moderated by risk posed by perceived surplus capacity.
896 2018-02-18 17:11:46 Also regrettably you haven't addressed anything I've said. The second amendment allows for guns, but you won't find any text regarding the right to bump stocks. While you do say a lot,  there is unfortunately very little content therein.
897 2018-02-18 17:11:15 Stocks plunged as Fannie Mae unveiled a fabulous check book today.
898 2018-02-18 17:08:30 I own a 9mm Walther PPQ & a Mossberg 500. I don’t own a semiautomatic NATO chambered rifle with extended magazines and bump stocks though. Do you know why? Because they aren’t necessary and their overpenetration due to excess muzzle velocity makes them terrible self defense guns
899 2018-02-18 17:07:28 Why? I have heard them being mentioned all the time

"Stocks and bonds! Stocks and bonds!"

Seems more difficult to get into based on cursory ask of jmmb rep. She didn't seem to recommend it.
900 2018-02-18 17:07:15 They can't even stop bump stocks, people with mental health/criminal records from purchasing or flea market sales. Even if they passed laws to align them with other countries, there are too many high powered guns already out there. Its inevitable this will happen again and again
901 2018-02-18 17:07:14 dude walked up to me, asked if i was a vendor, i told him i’m pep farm, he asked if i happened to know who stocks pies and i said no, and then, looking like he thought he was being clever, said “well it could be a pepperidge farm product!”

[ 5pm - 7pm ] - Sit down with a good read .
905 2018-02-18 17:03:47 Vote Rubio out of office.  He doesn't care about kids, only NRA campaign contributions.  Thoughts and prayers don't stop bullets.  Keeping a gun out of the hand of a crazy person does stop some bullets.  Outlawing bump stocks slows down the bullets.
906 2018-02-18 17:03:31 I really don't know why people think stocks are hard, I mean maybe because everyone just pays attention to the fundamentals. You should never look at the media for stock advice, they manipulate you, instead look at price action. that's all you need.
907 2018-02-18 17:03:20 It seems the time is apt to enter into aviation stocks in tranches.
908 2018-02-18 17:02:41 @SenCoryGardner @SenBennetCO 
You now have an opportunity to do something good. The safety of our children is more important than your reelection. Ban assault rifles. Ban bump stocks. Close the mental health and gun show loopholes.
#EmmaGonzalez #WeCallBS  Do the right thing!
909 2018-02-18 17:00:51 I costed a ton last time I got salmonella. 2 weeks wages, picked it up at a catered lunch at work. I did stimulate the economy though. Cottonelle stocks must have jumped.
910 2018-02-18 17:00:34 I grew up on a ranch so definitely not saying all guns should be banned but what's wrong with having some laws that make sense? 
- Medical professional can notify authorities a patient should not have access to weapons
- No bump stocks
- Ban large capacity ammo mags
911 2018-02-18 17:00:31 ou#stocks look around before you invest a dime. See where the rest of the world is going and what young people are doing. There's far more capital growth in the EM markets than here or in Europe. Look for EM blue chips wth a history of generous payouts and growth.
912 2018-02-18 16:59:42 I believe assault weapons, bump stocks, & high capacity mags should be banned. gun violence is out of control. Congress needs to act.  Don't vote for any politician that accepts  money from the NRA
913 2018-02-18 16:59:30 which r other 4 of magnificent 8? it appears to be too late now for these stocks
914 2018-02-18 16:59:09 No.. But it was awesome
915 2018-02-18 16:59:05 And yet the @gop majority in congress allows bump stocks to remain legal. Shameful.
916 2018-02-18 16:57:34 Bump stocks absolutely. The NRA wasn’t a big fan when they came out. The crazy Obama Admin ok’d them even with a chorus of gun sellers recommending they don’t.
917 2018-02-18 16:54:40 No Ed. Every time the Fed prints it funny and stocks firms up stream with cash particularly the big banks and multinational corporations. This gives them the upper hand in financing loans, products and services - increases cost downstream. Also, raising min wage spikes labor cost
918 2018-02-18 16:53:56 Of course trump won't do anything. No Republican will do anything. Even if they say they'll do something, they won't.

Does anybody remember Congress promising to outlaw bump stocks after the Vegas shooting? They knew Americans would forget. They were right.

923 2018-02-18 16:51:29 Limits on magazine capacity, funding for law enforcement to enforce existing gun laws & for a national gun registry, ban on bump stocks ... Lots of things could be done if the NRA didn't run the conversation.
924 2018-02-18 16:51:21 @SenatorLankford 
Senator, with respect, tougher background checks would not have stopped Las Vegas shooter fm purchasing AR15s plus bump stocks. No one needs a machine gun to protect themselves. Would hope you agree.
925 2018-02-18 16:51:13 Certain gun laws i agree 100% with you on. Such as strict background checks. Hell you can take bump stocks to. But as far as banning the AR-15 do you actually think that will solve gun violence??? Places like Chicago have very strict gun laws yet it's over run with crime.
926 2018-02-18 16:51:05 He’s right. It’s also armor piercing bullets, gun show/private sale loopholes, failures in our background check processes and policies, bump stocks, civilians running around in ballistic gear, rescinding Obama’s rules about arming the severely mentally ill, and much, much more.
927 2018-02-18 16:50:31 It's now undeniably true! Everything is in an extreme bubble stage stocks, bonds and yes, gold. Or, "everything is going up except the dollar"
928 2018-02-18 16:49:57 Macke.  You are still as fresh as ever.  We see you had a censored tagline.   Got any hot stocks for Tues?
929 2018-02-18 16:49:09 @realDonaldTrump  ban bump stocks and AR 15 rifles, there is absolutely no need for A citizen to own one in the United States, and at least you have done something instead of nothing, I carry a gun but I don’t need an automatic rifle to protect myself. FBI fails us, can’t depend
930 2018-02-18 16:47:59 Our world is not suited for the abnormal.
Wasting life learning to be formal.

Distracted, stuck like a coy in a pond.
Break the bond no matter how fond.

931 2018-02-18 16:47:25 For now. But it's a decline. Theater chains had stocks decline, game publishers had stocks decline, toy makers had stocks decline, it's constantly declining because they haven't been producing anything actually good and are selling purely on brand loyalty.

935 2018-02-18 16:43:58 Bump stocks and ARs are not a "product of the Constitution." That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Nor does the rest of your argument. You blame the mentally ill, but every country has mentally ill people. Where is the wisdom in arming them with ARs and bump stocks? Just stop.
936 2018-02-18 16:43:47 Barron's mentions: General Electric (NYSE:GE) is profiled in the cover story in a piece that tips to the cautionary side.

937 2018-02-18 16:41:55 Hey Trey, like the kid said:  “ He couldn’t have killed so many if he had a knife”.  Stop talking about “instrumentality”.  You and your party refused to extend the ban on Assault Weapons and refuse to do anything about Bump Stocks.

942 2018-02-18 16:39:39 The Vatican is the number one share holder in the Beretta arms company. Many other extremely valuable shares in various rifle manufacturing companies. Stocks are through the roof with the threat of "gun control" looming. See why we have mass shootings?

945 2018-02-18 16:37:47 I agree.  No where in my collection is an Assault Rifle or high magazine clip firearm.  No bump stocks or silencers.  Common Sense.  What other use is there for brass knuckles and what other use is there for assault weapons and accessories.
946 2018-02-18 16:37:44 Reasonable gun safety
1. Ban assault rifle ownership
2. Universal background checks
3. Repeal “Dickey Amendment”, banning CDC gun violence research
4. Ban gun modifications, like Bump Stocks
5. Reauthorize Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which also bans high capacity magazines.
947 2018-02-18 16:37:19 In a fair world, this would get you locked in the stocks for a day,  relentlessly pelted with warm balls of human feces.

957 2018-02-18 16:32:15 When I started to learn, I was thinking why should we pay price more than B.V.? What will happen when they default? I was more concerned about PB than PE.

962 2018-02-18 16:30:33 Stop with your phony caring and take action no one needs a weapon of war to hunt with- keep their hand guns and rifles and ban all assault guns, bump stocks and multiple rounds - reverse your decision to give mentally ill guns it apparently is not a good idea
963 2018-02-18 16:30:30 He’s lying. Call him on it. @gop and @nra we’re ok w banning bump stocks after Vegas. Soon as media looked away they reversed course.

965 2018-02-18 16:29:09 It’s not a state ban, it’s a ban in The city of Denver.  The city banned the rifles that use bump stocks years ago. There are probably fewer than 20 bump stocks in the entire city and none will be turned over.

967 2018-02-18 16:27:21 Then again after Vegas politicians still couldn't even come together to banning bump stocks. I have little hope or expectation that there will be any changes :(
968 2018-02-18 16:27:00 No you cannot. Bring a bill to the floor that eliminates assault rifles and bump stocks and forbids those with a felony, a mental health issue and a domestic abuse conviction or charge , from ever possessing a weapon that discharges a bullet of any kind.
969 2018-02-18 16:26:49 AR-15s are not automatic weapons.  They are semi-automatic like traditional hunting rifles...one trigger pull, one bullet.  Bump stocks or highly regulated adjustments are required to make them automatic.  Probably doesn’t change your view, but thought you might want to know.
970 2018-02-18 16:26:24 Bump stocks shouldn't be legal.  Lets compromise with that.  NRA even agrees on this.
971 2018-02-18 16:25:57 Law Reversal was the will of the Voting Citizenry who elected @POTUS . Bump Stocks and AR’s are a product of the Constitution. Any lawful company can sell their lawful product in the US. Focus on who pulls the trigger and your argument will become relevant. Mental Illness help!
972 2018-02-18 16:25:34 They express outrage after school shootings yet do nothing. What happened after sandy hook? Nothing What happened to the ban on bump stocks? Nothing. The 2nd amendment only goes so far. "Thoughts and prayers" only go so far. We need gun control legislation now-no more deflections
973 2018-02-18 16:25:31 Not to mention the now former CDC head who bought stocks in Asian tobacco...
974 2018-02-18 16:25:08 You may have thought they did, but Bill Ruger testified before Congress in favor of the gun ban and the Mini 14 was kept off the list. Only those with collapsible stocks and other traits were  banned. Also, no one's talking about then, we're talking about now.
975 2018-02-18 16:24:52 Make bump stocks illegal?

977 2018-02-18 16:24:33 Thing is, most gun owners don’t have a problem with some more legislation on mental health, bump stocks, reduced capacity mags and other things like that. But when you start talking about a ban of either a specific type of gun or any gun outside of what is already illegal, no.

980 2018-02-18 16:23:59 This is what my people do. See we buy chains, and fast cars, people like Bill Gates buy stocks, real estate, start businesses, invest in companies. We have to change our culture, be smarter.
981 2018-02-18 16:23:23 Some come with collapsible/foldable stocks so they are easier to conceal. That is one of the features that could make a weapon eligible to be banned under the old assault weapons ban.
982 2018-02-18 16:22:36 Why not? They would like to make profit quicker than stocks by investing in crypto coins.

1034 2018-02-18 16:06:12 Why can't we make the kit illegal? I know nothing about guns. But I know many places like Denver have made bump stocks illegal. The AR15 is villified because it was used in the Pulse, Vegas, and Stoneman shootings. I can't believe allowing this as a grown up "toy" is justified.
1035 2018-02-18 16:06:09 Not good enough!  Ban semi automatic weapons and bump stocks now!  As Emma Gonzalez said we are calling out BS!
1036 2018-02-18 16:05:53 I am TIRED of the GOP’s line “don’t look at the Guns, look at the Sick People with the Guns”....if there weren’t semi-automatics and bump stocks freely available, on either the open or black markets, there’d be far less deaths.

1050 2018-02-18 15:59:43 Targeted gun bans absolutely work. The reason "bump stocks" entered the national vocabulary at all is because access to fully automatic weapons is extremely limited and highly cost-prohibitive. 

Or we could do nothing. Either way.

1053 2018-02-18 15:59:09 No I don’t. Bump stocks simulate automatic fire and since automatic firearms aren’t legal I’m okay with them being banned. Even the NRA supports a ban.
1054 2018-02-18 15:59:09 We have 3D printers. Law won’t stop bump stocks or 30 round clips
1055 2018-02-18 15:58:52 Balance. You are right; that’s what we need. But we can’t get it, Mooch. After Vegas, we couldn’t even get any action on bump stocks. Handguns and hunting weapons are one thing, semi-automatic assault rifles are another.
1056 2018-02-18 15:58:12 Give your NRA money back to them and tell your electorate what you are doing about gun violence? Yes or no, ban assault rifles and bump stocks. Make gun registration a law, prevent mentally ill from purchasing, more stringent screening of buyers, etc. #toomey #AR15

1097 2018-02-18 15:36:36 Foes he actually think that mass dhow tings would stop if we couldn't buy a God Darned AR15? This is all feel good Rhetoric ..And policy..If we got rid of Bump Stocks ,would this recent tragedy been prevented? NO..

1099 2018-02-18 15:35:59 Yes. Urge your colleagues to ban assault weapons and bump stocks!
1100 2018-02-18 15:35:54 ppl  r mad ,as a gun owner I believe in tougher BG checks (mental)  and bump stocks and 30 rd Clips stopped  , no reason ban guns,  there are 12-15 mil AR15 in country now.  This talk sold another 3k over weekend , get done what makes sense
1101 2018-02-18 15:35:13 Honestly tho, maybe it's time to put these skills into stocks- Imjk

GUN OWNERS I KNOW R AGAINST AR-15s & BUMP STOCKS SO WHY DOES NRA CONTROL SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS THAT DON'T  WANT KILLING? PREVENT THIS BY DONATING YOUR #NRABLOODMONEY TO THE VICTIMS, U R 2 BLAME!!
1106 2018-02-18 15:32:39 Solving the mass murdurs is very simple ban assalt riffles, semi automatics, bump stocks, make them illegal to own, make the illegal to sell. If a shooter only had a riffle or a hand gun more people could have gotten away We don't need those types of guns, Kids are more important
1107 2018-02-18 15:32:02 I've got no problem with having firearms for protection, hell I have a pistol, but I agree that there's no room for the likes of assault rifles & bump-stocks. The real chore is getting these out of the hands of criminals...
1108 2018-02-18 15:32:01 There stocks were legit sinking
1109 2018-02-18 15:32:01 1) "assault rifles" account for 350 deaths a year.
2) plenty of mass shootings have been committed with small capacity magazines.
3) plenty of people have large stocks of ammo that haven t fired a single shot at another person.
4) you can't license a right.

1116 2018-02-18 15:27:54 If you can't ban silencers and bump stocks, you certainly can't get assault rifles removed from the US gun culture. Panelists (including Rick Santelli who is somehow included on this subject) are delusional #MTP

1119 2018-02-18 15:27:00 One can make a thought AND a prayer AND do something tangible.  They are not mutually exclusive. It's kind of like saying: I send you my breaths and my heartbeats.  One can breath and have a beating heart AND ban AR-15's and bump stocks and make other sensible regs
1120 2018-02-18 15:26:52 Bump stocks, background checks, guns crossing state borders, gun sales to terror watchlist and mentally ill.  Where do you stand?
1121 2018-02-18 15:26:13 I would look out for stocks and crowdfunding opportunities connected to renewables and fintech especially those espousing real world DLT applications.
1122 2018-02-18 15:25:03 you're looking for something undervalued (stocks, bonds, real estate, cryptocurrencies) by the market in hopes to profit when the market realizes it. Anything else is just gambling.
1123 2018-02-18 15:24:50 Thank you for your reply, and I appreciate our collective view on banning bump stocks.
1124 2018-02-18 15:24:33 You know how 90% of stocks are owned by 10% of Americans? The US government legally required to know this.

What if 90% of all guns are owned by 10% of Americans? The US government is legally banned from knowing this.

1132 2018-02-18 15:21:19 I'm all for it, but there are folks like pelosi, who you give an inch and she takes a mile. Look at bump stocks after Vegas. Even NRA agreed they should be banned. She then made a bill that banned over thirty attachments for guns.
1133 2018-02-18 15:20:48 They’re not my people, slappy. What has the NRA done? Universal background checks have somewhere around 90% support. NRA blood money has kept that off the floor in Congress. Where is the bill outlawing bump stocks, that we were promised after Vegas?

1136 2018-02-18 15:19:05 Because gun control laws make it very difficult to acquire fully automatic weapons.  It's difficult for most people to safely modify a semi auto into a full auto.  That's why bump stocks were popular.
1137 2018-02-18 15:18:33 $GLD sold off from $127 (1/29) to $124 (2/9). That was the equity correction time frame. $GC_F went from $1350 to $1307. I wouldn't say that it wen't "down with equities". Now, Gold Miner stocks got hit hard, but not actual Gold.
1138 2018-02-18 15:18:30 What the hell are you talking about on CNN? Stop waffling on the issue & making excuses. It’s not complicated - just ban the damn assault weapons and the bump stocks. Done. Period. There I solved it for you.
1139 2018-02-18 15:17:12 How about mentally ill teenagers should not be able to buy an AR 15? Why is there no wait time for the purchase of these guns? Handguns have a wait time. How about making bump stocks illegal? How about kicking the NRA out of politicians pockets? They're supposed to represent us
1140 2018-02-18 15:17:12 You need a license to drive a car. You need a license for cpr and first aid class. You should need a license for an ar-15 and bump stocks at 21. With a license and wait period of 15 days minimum background check. With exception of military or police.
1141 2018-02-18 15:16:56 Franchisees will claim their stocks of diamonds/gems by producing invoices and stock reports.

Every franchisee have invested 7 -10 crores in stock alone.

1145 2018-02-18 15:13:33 The difference between Norway and Australia is the access to semi-automatic and concealable weapons. Instead I see crazy policy like "open carry" and the permissions for bump stocks in the US.

1150 2018-02-18 15:10:17 Why didn't the Obama administration ban bump stocks? They had the chance and the votes, but they declined.
1151 2018-02-18 15:09:29 Yeah, but I honestly don't see anything offered by gun controllers other than banning bump stocks, which I agree with, that will actually make a difference.
1152 2018-02-18 15:09:25 I don't support "No Fly Lists"- unconstitutional, I oppose restricting gun sales based on such a list. "Right Wing" ? Not at all, the @ACLU agrees with me ! But bump stocks and other full auto mods ? Those MUST go ! Plenty of lawful & Constitutional options. #NRABloodMoney

 &  TINPLATE in the light of US import tariffs and quota restrictions on steel and Aluminium companies in India.
1157 2018-02-18 15:02:15 Apples and oranges but i'll play. Bump stocks modify the weapon to fire more rounds and should be banned. An AR-15 is a single shot rifle and is used for hunting.
1158 2018-02-18 15:01:48 Bump stocks were originally designed to allow disabled veterans to shoot faster. I would be fine with some regulations on them. But the intended purpose was to allow disabled veterans to shoot faster and with a better form.

1161 2018-02-18 14:59:57 Completely agree! Our law enforcement & military should never have to worry about being outgunned. No semiautomatic weapons, no bump stocks, no high-capacity clips/magazines. Our forefathers did not win/tame the wilderness with a machine gun.
1162 2018-02-18 14:59:07 @RoyCooperNC @carolina Kendra Stocks should not go to jail for baptizing her child. Even if the judge says its contempt of court, a simple fine would have been adequate. He is overpunishing someone for practicing their faith.
1163 2018-02-18 14:59:06 @IvankaTrump The blood of Parkland, and massacres to come, covers your Dad and all opposing a ban on assault rifles, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks.

1164 2018-02-18 14:58:22 Maybe aware there is something strange called bitcoin that you better stay away from not to lose your money. Germans don't even hardly buy stocks.
1165 2018-02-18 14:57:35 How about we start with not letting any more assault rifles get into distribution, stop selling armor-piercing bullets and bump stocks, and doing whatever we can to update the FBI databases so people with mental issues can't get a gun in the first place?  Can we at least START??
1166 2018-02-18 14:56:41 Sturm,ruger,smith&wesson and to a lesser extent vista outdoor are publicly held weapons manufacturers. I'm going ro make sure my 401k does not include any of these stocks until they show some social responsibility #gunsense #NeverAgain
1167 2018-02-18 14:56:35 Joe, you are right. However, they are advertised as assault rifles. And “bump stocks” make them assault rifles.
1168 2018-02-18 14:55:04 Yes. I'm articulate so I must be a raging Liberal & be called names. I have no problems with responsible gun ownership, but I do with AR-15's & bump stocks. I'm from Tx for Christ sake, my 1st hunting trip was with my Dad when I was 5. One of my best memories.
1169 2018-02-18 14:53:59 WHY ARE BUMP STOCKS AND AR-15's STILL LEGAL!?!?!?
1170 2018-02-18 14:53:54 Can we agree that people with mental health issues should be banned from owning guns and that bump stocks, extended mags, and military grade assault weapons should be illegal tho... I mean that’s pretty common sense.. even republicans have questioned the merit of those things
1171 2018-02-18 14:52:55 Just now on @CNNSotu @AndreBauerSC (paraphrasing, don’t have exact quote) - sure we could do those things (ban bump stocks, allow CDC to study stats, ban assault weaps, tighter bkgrd ) but does that really solve the prob?

THIS  is @NRA speak arguing against ANY controls
1172 2018-02-18 14:52:39 @realDonaldTrump you like to make executive orders. How about these. 1 assault weapons banned including machine pistols +the like. 2 bump stocks +extended magazines+silencers banned. 3 “social welfare” nonprofits +all pacs must show complete money trail back to original donor.
1173 2018-02-18 14:52:11 Do you have top Canadian stocks
1174 2018-02-18 14:52:09 We’re numb because the #NRA owns the issue.
A group that is against banning AR-15s and bump stocks.
We vilified the tobacco lobby, the big energy lobby, but give the gun lobby a pass...

1175 2018-02-18 14:51:37 None. But it is why you got stocks instead of a bonus

1177 2018-02-18 14:49:10 Not saying anything about advice. It’s not advice. But ppl need to accept the current rules for stocks and apply here - that’s reality of it.Stop trying to fight reality You are living in fantasy world if you think politicians and judges in USA gonna go against SEC on a grey area

1179 2018-02-18 14:46:26 AR-15 with bump stocks can fire at full auto speeds. Others in this thread pointed out just how easy it is to make your own homemade device for full auto bump fire.
1180 2018-02-18 14:46:12 Targets of these stocks ?
1181 2018-02-18 14:46:05 Bring back the ban on assault rifles that was overturned in 2002. Buy back all assault rifles as they did in Australia. Have to register all cars, make all guns have to be registered and if caught with unregistered it’s confiscated. Ban bump stocks. Do something!!!! #NeverAgain
1182 2018-02-18 14:45:05 The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism. The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. @porinju
1183 2018-02-18 14:44:06 Condolences are hollow words. To hope & pray won't stop an AR-15 from emptying a clip in 3 seconds. Why are gun owners rights to an AR-15 > my right to safety? Bump stocks? Nothing. Talk later? Talk NOW! We don't need another Hinkley Jr. to pass laws to make all humans safe! NOW!
1184 2018-02-18 14:41:48 @senrobportman It's time to ban assault weapons sales to teenagers, ban bum stocks, and conduct mandatory background checks. NO more mass shootings. Do something.

1193 2018-02-18 14:29:01 WOW! Don & Freinds get millions to line their pockets, buy back stocks & give 1 x bonuses.  Next step - inflation is going to tick up that will be reflected in his grocery bill, medical & with a tax on gas should maybe allow him to break even. But sure celebrate mediocrity

1202 2018-02-18 14:24:30 @senrobportman So how's your study going on with bump stocks? What a bunch of crap. You're getting people killed by your pay-offs from the NRA. When do you become a human being? When do you stop our lies?
1203 2018-02-18 14:24:09 Incorrect. The hmans just identified specific rights of all humans. One of which is to defend one self. Also, assault rifles and bump stocks are already banned. So we are good there. Is a hand gun good enough? Depends on what the enemy has.
1204 2018-02-18 14:23:03 I appreciate you! Thank you! Book stores keep low stocks. We have to either order it from the store and come back or hit the online sites.
1205 2018-02-18 14:21:54 They should ban bump stocks but legalize full autos

1209 2018-02-18 14:20:23 Sold long equity index future exposure Thursday at the close and flipped short Friday afternoon on rejection of 20DMA. A futures rug pull on Monday into closed equity markets is a spooky thought. Monday/Tuesday is a fairly strong Bradley turn date for stocks, too.
1210 2018-02-18 14:19:16 So has enough time passed from Las Vegas massacre to regulate bump stocks? Or is plan to do nothing (on, plus last year you passed law making it easier for mentally-challenged to get guns)? @PRyan
1211 2018-02-18 14:18:19 And thank you Matt. It seems there always has to be a scapegoat, often the most vulnerable, and never weapons manufacturers. Semi automatics with bump stocks do kill people. That is their main purpose.

1214 2018-02-18 14:16:47 I mean the REIT bubble is ignored because everyone is focused on the red herring headline of the ETF bubble.  SPX stocks are about 5% owned by ETFs.  REITs are about 15% owned by ETFs.
1215 2018-02-18 14:15:34 It depends if we still have stocks left ^^
1216 2018-02-18 14:13:48 To be fair, after the last tax cut big organization is now in debt to the government. And they use the money they save to buy back stocks. Trickle down only works in the toilet.

1220 2018-02-18 14:11:22 @Tim_Walz I must tell you that I cannot vote for you due to your stance on gun control.  You can prove me wrong by leading the way on barring AR-15s, by barring bump stocks.  There is no civilian use for either of them. You can close the gun show loophole.  Do something!!!
1221 2018-02-18 14:11:12 If the fanatics insist we're safer with AR-15s and bump stocks on the street, why stop there? Why not grenades, land mines and mortars? The dividing line between weapons of war only soldiers should use and protected 2A arms isn't clear to me #BloodMoney

1226 2018-02-18 14:09:39 I'm making a good guess it didn't mean AR-15s, high capacity magazines, & bump stocks either. Last time I checked they used muskets with bayonets on the end. But hey, history may be wrong. #ThoughtsAndPrayersDoNothing #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #GunReformNow

1241 2018-02-18 13:59:46 Oh, make no mistake - both parties are complicit in the failure to protect our kids. But NRA support is over 98% Republican. They consistently block any kind of bans, including bump stocks and cop killer bullets.
1242 2018-02-18 13:59:11 Gmorning! Yes citizens should have guns to protect their families/hunt/target shooting..but gotta be universal background checks,no selling guns to ppl on the "No Fly" list,mentally ill,those with restraining orders/criminal record & band bump stocks/semi automatics machine guns.
1243 2018-02-18 13:59:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1244 2018-02-18 13:58:35 We should not ban guns, just  hi capacity ARs with bump stocks.
1245 2018-02-18 13:57:08 It can simulate it but the rifle still must have the trigger actioned by the finger each time a bullet is fired, his functionally not an automatic. The same effect can be done in dozens of ways. Bump a stocks have been around 20 years with 0 crime use until Vegas. Good scapegoat.
1246 2018-02-18 13:56:53 There’s not enough paper or hemp supplies. I think short term use stocks that are there and don’t automatically give someone a straw unless they ask
1247 2018-02-18 13:56:47 It is your NRA buddies that have kept all legislation from moving forward. Why haven't you banned bump stocks yet? That happened on your watch. You and the rest of the GOP take almost all of the NRA Campaign contributions. NRA runs ads only against Dems.

1254 2018-02-18 13:53:34 The psychopaths won’t even ban the Bump Stocks that convert these weapons into fully automatic. So I’m afraid there’s more 18 year olds with death machines then we can fathom. And more to come.
1255 2018-02-18 13:53:29 I’m all for guns.  But there is no need for AR-15s....unless you’re in the military and or on a S.W.A.T. team.  There is no need for bump stocks.  There ARE suck things as REASON GUN CONTROL LAWS.
1256 2018-02-18 13:52:02 Are we applying enough of a #systemsthinking approach to school massacres? What are the stocks and flows? What are the feedback loops? Are they balancing or reinforcing? Which loops dominate? What other systems and subsystems are involved? Where are the leverage points?

1258 2018-02-18 13:50:52 I’m speechless. I’m for the second amendment but I don’t think we need assault rifles in the general public. A 18 year old bought this gun. I would be for a reasonable plan to make this not happen again. Bump stocks! The NRA says we agree! Why is nothing happening..
1259 2018-02-18 13:48:44 People, Please call your representatives and ask for stronger background checks, banning assault weapons, bump stocks, and a law that prohibits politicians accepting money from the NRA and NRA sponsored Leadership PACS.
1260 2018-02-18 13:47:17 You don't need stock markets to make money in investing. Mkt is just a place to buy and sell stocks. Many investors make wealth in unlisted stocks of companies as well.

1266 2018-02-18 13:44:25 The right isn't god given. It's an amendment to the constitution drawn up by humans.
But if you insist: Stop letting people buy semi-automatic weapons & bump stocks. Stop allowing people with mental illnesses to buy guns. If you must "defend" yourself, why not a hand gun? Enough?

1268 2018-02-18 13:43:49 I believe that the 2nd Amendment's intent has been twisted by the NRA. Hand guns, yes. Military-style, rapid-fire assault weapons & bump stocks, no.
1269 2018-02-18 13:43:30 Ar’s aren’t full auto, they’re semi. Which is pulling the trigger as fast as you can just like a pistol or shotgun in some cases. There are bump stocks that make them somewhat fully automatic but that’s not stock.
1270 2018-02-18 13:43:22 Had 1000 stocks of Abbey National once. Sold them at £2.50. 20 years later each is over £1,200!!! I’ll be damned! Could have retired a long time ago!

WHY DO THOSE, PAID OFF BY NRA, NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 4 THEIR PART ?
1280 2018-02-18 13:35:50 Still waiting po kami sa stocks
1281 2018-02-18 13:35:12 1st step to protect our citizens from gun violence is to ban the AR15 as it is a weapon of war, ban bump stocks, limit magazine size, and outlaw tracer rounds. We aren’t coming for your guns, we just want to save lives.

1283 2018-02-18 13:33:41 However, most "gun sense" people have no inkling about any of that. They want to ban superficial and inconsequential things like folding stocks or pistol grips. Those aren't the fucking issue here. Wanna be an advocate for change?Know AR vs M-16 vs Mini-14 arguments and specs 11/
1284 2018-02-18 13:31:06 Really?  Bump stocks and high capacity magazines are equivalent to car gasoline?  Do you really want to go that far down the ideological rabbit hole?
1285 2018-02-18 13:30:36 He and his leeches are probably already waiting for their School Security Systems and Armed Guards stocks to skyrocket. There are people that benefit from this, who earn money of this. It is evil, and criminal, yes. But so is he & his party. They love profit over people any day
1286 2018-02-18 13:30:33 Great advice or have a diversified portfolio (stocks, funds, pension, crypto, property, assets), but don't invest more than one is willing to lose and also don't put them all in one basket.
1287 2018-02-18 13:30:23 If “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” then how come people who really do want to kill a bunch of people always load up on guns? Preferably semiautomatic guns, with bump stocks?

1290 2018-02-18 13:28:09 Then how did a Florida teen with a history of mental illness legally buy a military-style assault weapon with no wait time? And how did the Vegas shooter legally stockpile AR-15s with bump-stocks and armor-piercing bullets?
1291 2018-02-18 13:26:01 How much do you know about the Kardashians? Now how much do you know about Taxes, stocks, and mutual funds? Yeah the exit is behind you
1292 2018-02-18 13:24:18 How is restrictions on gun ownership any different?  For the “law abiding” citizen it is inconvenient. Maybe you don’t get everything you want(can’t bring certain items in a plane,  can’t have bump stocks). So it is a little inconvenient. Is it worth saving some lives to you?
1293 2018-02-18 13:23:11 Wrong. Bump stocks are not illegal.
1294 2018-02-18 13:22:20 We just need to enforce the laws we have.  We don't need anymore except maybe a law against bump stocks.
1295 2018-02-18 13:21:57 He doesn't want to ban assault weapons but he believes bump stocks should not be readily available. His logic should also then include assault weapons but unsurprisingly he won't.
1296 2018-02-18 13:21:41 sold out na since yesterday  wala pa sila kabalo when mag arrive ang next batch sa stocks. pero thank you!!! 
1297 2018-02-18 13:19:08 I think at this point. Any would do. There was no direct action after Las Vegas. Other than hotels preparing for another shooting. Bump stocks still legal. Las Vegas shooting was just FORGOTTEN by people it didn’t directly effect until later shootings.
1298 2018-02-18 13:19:03 Here's an example of the gun problem. This jerk is a congressman from Kentucky. Day after the Las Vegas shootings he came out in favor of legalizing bump stocks, even posted a picture of himself with an assault weapon. Now he wants to arm teachers.

1301 2018-02-18 13:18:03 @realDonaldTrump I believe in the 2nd amendment, but NOW is the time to put a stop on Assault rifles and bump stocks, NOW IS THE TIME, it is one more nail in the dems coffins and will show the true heart of your administration
1302 2018-02-18 13:15:14 Yes & No. Correct it is not military grade so it is not an assault rifle. It is a basic hunting rifle with copy stocks. In england & australia where these guns are banned the mass killers use bombs & fire & knives. Mass killings accepted definition as 4 or more dead per action.

1329 2018-02-18 12:50:00 We agree you are complacent & part of killing our children. NRA tells its puppets like you to frame this as a mental health issue only. Your prez turned back the Obama regs that said mentally ill can’t get guns. Aren’t you proud of him? NO ARs, NO Bump Stocks, LIMIT Bullets NOW!
1330 2018-02-18 12:48:36 Skrillex whom'st   with angry stocks !
1331 2018-02-18 12:48:07 Routine. LIC invests cash reserves in stocks & earns handsome equity returns. Earned INR 19000 cr. just from stocks in 16-17. When markets crash, the govt. turns to LIC to bail it out. When reserves runs dry, LIC offers liquidity. Has bailed out every single govt. Many times.
1332 2018-02-18 12:45:29 Invest into yourself man, how many people gotta say this for y’all to wake up and say hmm I’m not doing something right . 
Cuz u not ! 
If u good at playing with ya butt then open a company for butt playing like it’s really that easy .
You have 1k ?Invest into stocks . That easy
1333 2018-02-18 12:45:23 @xile737 DCTH almost made me give up stocks completely hahaha. Then FCEL gave me hope. I research fuel cells religiously now.
1334 2018-02-18 12:45:14 It depends if we still have stocks left after the exhibit (:
1335 2018-02-18 12:43:27 Apply the fix and it will work.  I don't know the stocks you mention. you will have to check if the right price is downloaded.
1336 2018-02-18 12:41:58 Sa states ako bumili, pinaship ko kay BJ. Mas mura dun saka laging may stocks kasi. Pero yeah abangan mo na lang sa Healthy Options :)
1337 2018-02-18 12:39:55 Are you proud the NRA spent 10K on Nikolas Cruz to ensure he could murder 17 of his classmates?

We don't use AR-15s for hunting.
Bump stocks are not for hunting.
@NRA isn't about gun ownership, it's virtually an as agency.
Gun manufacturers pay the nra to promote more sales.
1338 2018-02-18 12:38:48 This is an excellent paper.  Brilliant coverage of League one and Two which hardly get a mention in the Sunday newspapers.  However it's very difficult to find a retailer where I live that stocks it.  I've only found it on a handful of occasions this season.
1339 2018-02-18 12:37:58 Is this the official position of the NRA or just assumed about the NRA in relation to Bump Stocks?
1340 2018-02-18 12:36:02 Can you give some stocks name sir?
1341 2018-02-18 12:35:57 I know but the problem is, the NRA is against the banning of bump stocks and lawmakers are afraid to go against the them because they rely on their financial support. So the massacres continue.
1342 2018-02-18 12:34:09 Seems like we have another one for the stocks. Bugger I'm out of rotten cabbages.
1343 2018-02-18 12:33:30 We're sorry but we don't have information here about stocks onboard. You would need to approach the onboard team for this.
1344 2018-02-18 12:33:19 All the stocks are down because of the entire market correction. About 40% across the board. Listen I'm not to happy myself but it's not the time to sell anything at this point because it will turn around and I'm certainly not giving them away for cheap. Patience
1345 2018-02-18 12:32:25 Chicago! do you need more proof?

1354 2018-02-18 12:26:38 yes, if you'll rally 2% most of the stocks won't be trading cheap to option price. look for 38% discount value to find the cheaper one and the risk is that it has to go up like 2% to profit.
1355 2018-02-18 12:25:02 President’s aren’t kings, neither of these men had the constitutional authority to ban the sale of any weapon. Any attempt to do so would be struck down by the Supreme court.

Legislatives reforms like this must come from Congress, who haven’t even managed to ban bump stocks.
1356 2018-02-18 12:23:45 Bump stocks don’t make sense to me. It does seem like there could be legislation that would restrict tools converting weapons to automatic (in use).
1357 2018-02-18 12:22:12 @POTUS NEEDS TO ACT. REASONABLE GUN CONTROL OF AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, BUMP STOCKS, AND BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE THE FIRST STEP. NOT JUST A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. REPUBLICAN'S ARE TAKING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE NOTHING BUT BRIBES FROM NRA. TOXIC TRUMP TOOK $30 MILLION.
1358 2018-02-18 12:21:53 Same here, most of the time I watch the same stocks Andrew does but it gives me more conviction to don't let my eyes off them.
1359 2018-02-18 12:19:52 Yeah that probably does capture how awful it was - my other memory that perhaps didn't come across in blog was how Stocks just kept falling. End of day you'd think "they must be better tomorrow" but they would be worse  !!!
1360 2018-02-18 12:19:41 Dumbest thing in world. Other side of every trade isn't way to compete when you have time element. Take basket of 10 stocks, $100k and 3 months and see who has greater returns. Long or short plus entry/exit  times is how to do it.
1361 2018-02-18 12:18:46 Who needs body armor, gas masks, bump stocks, ASSAULT MILITARY WEAPONS? The MILITARY, not civilians.

1363 2018-02-18 12:17:05 I understand, but there’s so much more that needs to be done. Lawmakers are failing miserably. They can’t even get bump-stocks banned.
1364 2018-02-18 12:16:02 It appears Arron Banks's idiot propagandist is out of step with the Sunday Telegraph with his risible bullshite.

Their money section headline this morning - "Global investors desert Brexit Britain - it's your moment to buy cheap stocks"

1367 2018-02-18 12:11:07 Cut the crap, Bill.  The '94 AWB was a load of shit and you know it.  Folding stocks, flash hiders and bayonet lugs have absolutely nothing to do with the function of ANY firearm, and banning guns based on cosmetics is both stupid and ineffective.

This sector has potential to grow @20-25% CAGR for next 15 years- multibagger story.
One should accumulate whenever stocks come down due to crude rise in the next 1-2 years.
1373 2018-02-18 12:06:09 Glad you agree. Now let’s get rid of the weapons that have been involved in just about all mass shootings, too. Nobody needs an assault rifle except a Marine on active duty. Also bump-stocks and large magazines. #NRATool
1374 2018-02-18 12:04:45 Depende sa company 'yan ah! Hahaha nagkataon lang nagrally stocks nyan dahil sila 'yong magiging partner ng third telco na papasok dito. Hahaha.
1375 2018-02-18 12:04:16 @SenSanders Go get them Bernie. Florida and the public’s response has presented a rare opportunity to attackthe NRA, the Republicans, and Trump. I don’t think they will be able to deflect, delay, or deny their way out of this one. Ban assault weapons, bunk stocks, and mags now!!
1376 2018-02-18 12:02:55 If they haven't gotten a copy of The New Energy Almanac: Lithium Edition yet, then they can't really consider themselves serious lithium investors, whether they've already bought a stock or not! It's got over 200 publicly traded lithium plays in it! Lots of stocks left to buy.
1377 2018-02-18 12:01:49 Agree, I think it’s fine for kids to learn responsible handling of firearms at high school age. That’s not the problem. 
IMO, it is that assault rifles and stock piles of ammo and guns are easy for anyone to get and don’t set off any alarm bells. Bump stocks are unnecessary too.
1378 2018-02-18 12:00:18 Momentum guys are like Gate Keepers to Heaven...

Value (or not so much value) stocks have to pass these gates eventually it has to shine!!

So MoMo may not be the cheapest picking point, but every stock has to pass through the MoMo Gate!!

1381 2018-02-18 11:55:19 Now what happens when the NRA yanks on the financial leash? Weren’t they all for banning bump stocks until the pressure died down? You’ve given us over $3 million reasons to disbelieve you. We need actions, not words. #NoNRAMoney

1386 2018-02-18 11:46:01 Common fisheries policy preserves fish stocks, or would you rather they be fished out? Let's take car industry. 77% of UK cars exported. EU accounts for 57% China and the USA take another 20% So where are the new markets? EU will have FTAs with India & China before the UK does
1387 2018-02-18 11:45:21 Amnesties, buy backs, some legislation. Of course there will be resistence but any measure that reduces stocks and demand thereby reducing the risk is worth pursuing.
1388 2018-02-18 11:43:19 Dalio will have better luck if he shorted half of S&P 500 stocks since soaring rates will bring down U.S stocks! The day of hedge funds beating averages long gone!

1398 2018-02-18 11:21:38 And you can bet the @NRA's response will be to hunker down with one eye on their stocks, while assuring people it'll blow over.  Because they're bastards.

1451 2018-02-18 10:01:27 Public flogging? Does the Cheshire police still have stocks?
1452 2018-02-18 10:01:18 Okay... so being clueless I actually researched bump stocks. And it’s a loop hole. Because it doesn’t “technically” make it fully auto. However FA 98 shots in 7 seconds. Las Vegas shooter with Bump Stock 90 shots in 10 seconds. Hardly a difference!

1456 2018-02-18 09:54:20 President Obama's ATF also decided a few years ago that bump stocks wouldn't be a real problem.

 I hate political hypocrites. Democratic, Republican or Independent.
1457 2018-02-18 09:49:18 Hi! In cases like these it's best to check the model number. In addition, stocks and availability also depend on the retailer. ^NL
1458 2018-02-18 09:46:07 This might not turn out to be the way it has to be, 1) selection of stock is important 2) 5 year horizon is not proper for all stocks 3) can be reverse in bear market
1459 2018-02-18 09:45:14 The second amendment was written about muskets/ not semi-automatic assault rifles with bump stocks
1460 2018-02-18 09:44:40 Make politicians see the carnage first hand. Then have them stand before the injured & those who lost loved ones & explain why they won't ban assault weapons & bump stocks, limit & track ammunition purchases, restrict magazine capacity, restore funds for mental health svcs, etc.
1461 2018-02-18 09:43:26 Restricted, as in licence must be obtained and this includes the possibility of RCMP contacting family/friends. They only actually do so in a minority of cases.  Paddock would have got his guns easily but not his stocks.

1464 2018-02-18 09:39:36 Sure, Mick. I actually think passive funds are *better* placed to hold company boards to account over the long term than active funds, which typically hold stocks for just a year or two. Progress has been made, but more needed!
1465 2018-02-18 09:38:38 Not very good though surely you can’t run out of stocks that quick? Planning? stock ordering?

1482 2018-02-18 08:51:34 U r very right. Just to clarify further. A wealthy businessman gives loans or grants to his relative n friends. This can b inform of money or stocks or both. In turn this one is obliged to benefit others just the way he had.

1484 2018-02-18 08:47:46 Bump stocks can't be sold.
Ban or special permit for assault weapons.
Must be 21 to buy assault weapons.

any DUIs, or alcohol or drug offenses, ditto.

1486 2018-02-18 08:42:06 That’s a very strong argument for just plain banning the sale of assault weapons and any paraphernalia that turns a weapon into one that mimics an assault weapon ie bump stocks. There is absolutely no reason for a civilian to own assault weapons.

1496 2018-02-18 08:27:00 Higher level thinking isn’t being used by GOP. There are already bills waiting for a vote to ban assault weapon sales (Brady bill), ban accessories like bump stocks, expand background checks, add waiting periods in states (like FL) that don’t demand them.

1501 2018-02-18 08:18:56 i own both stocks, bought Telstra around $3.50s level, simply because its return on equity and margins are very high and they've managed to keep it that way. it is simply not a $3.5 per share stock, but its not CSL either. its more a cigar butt stock, to quote Buffett - 1
1502 2018-02-18 08:17:19 I am very pro 2A, I own lots of guns but I am 100% ok with banning bump stocks, 30+ round magazines & the gun show loophole. My hunting weapons are all bolt action (and bows) but  I do own semi-autos, as well.

But yeah, bump fire stocks should already be considered illegal modifications. The ATF banned it in 2005, not sure why its come back.

1511 2018-02-18 08:00:59 Guns should require licences and at least a 30 day waiting period & comprehensive background check. There’s no reason why anyone needs a semi automatic weapon. They should be banned as should bump stocks. There’s a reason shootings are rarely committed w/ fully automatic weapons.
1512 2018-02-18 07:59:31 Wow, ever considered owning less stocks?
Just a thought
1513 2018-02-18 07:57:18 Drawdowns are unavoidable however fundamentally strong your stock is. Be prepared for drawdowns. Investing in stocks is not like putting money into a liquid fund which delivers fixed returns every year. 25 percent drops are normal before market cap catches up with the IRR. 1/n

1516 2018-02-18 07:54:09 Very much agree. But the surprise comes only when one did all the proper homework before 5 years, invested a good amount say 1 Lakh, but sold out in a hurry once it reached 1.5 in a year...Such good stocks could have become 5 times in this 5 years.

1558 2018-02-18 07:06:38 But it means a much more thorough background check and a waiting period of a person is buying bump stocks and an AR-15, or several guns at once, vs buying a handgun

1583 2018-02-18 06:34:39 How much of the clean energy stocks were supported by subsidies compared to fossil fuel stocks. Did subsidies in effect provide an artificial bottom to the clean energy stocks? Would be great to have answers.
1584 2018-02-18 06:34:35 kinda makes u wonder why the dems added on to the resolution about bump stocks.  .  Kinda killed it before it took off.   My guess is that they want a ban on guns...but won’t come out and say it

1591 2018-02-18 06:27:05 <sigh> Thats NOT the answer. So sick of hearing "assault rifle" thrown around. You realize rifles with brown wood stocks can kill people too, right? Try focusing your rage on some attainable and realistic goals like thorough background checks and better mental health care.

1595 2018-02-18 06:23:16 Must change gun culture and the way we think. We devolved into what we have now...we can evolve back. Start by banning armor piercing bullets...and even if it spurs sales, ban military style weapons and those bump stocks. Better than doing nothing. #gundementia

1610 2018-02-18 06:12:30 Bump stocks should have never been sold.. you right that should have been a gimme.. But they could not get enough "Dem's" or Rep's  to agree?? idk why...
1611 2018-02-18 06:08:15 All these stocks also recommended all r gems but can't write down all

1615 2018-02-18 06:07:35 Pretty Stocks..
1616 2018-02-18 06:07:28 Thank you for the clarification but with bump stocks and semis so readily available for any sociopath or mentally ill person to purchase no child in any school is safe. That’s enough for me to know they need to be banned.
1617 2018-02-18 06:05:42 On principle, I’m not there for that. NOBODY needs bump stocks and assault style guns. Those are for military & for killing people. Nobody can love guns more than they love people. No one can love guns more than they live people.
1618 2018-02-18 06:05:04 Half price knitting patterns and books - see our sales table.  Some are even 'free' - while stocks last only!!
1619 2018-02-18 06:03:05 For those not able to grasp the situation our Indian market is in wish to see facts in figures than here is how it looks
Index top to now is just 10% down
Stocks top to now low is 30 to 40% down

Those stocks that hold the index haven't ever moved at all not in the rally nor now

1649 2018-02-18 05:43:13 I said that, "ban bump stocks and items with similar purpose". The bill specifically called out modifications for the increasing the rate of fire of semi-auto guns. This is a proactive approach. Otherwise you have to wait for people to die to prevent murder.
1650 2018-02-18 05:43:10 COMPASS UNITY stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
1651 2018-02-18 05:42:50 Right. Because 30 yrs ago, laws made them illegal. So gun laws worked with machine guns. We can then extrapolate that laws could work with high-capacity magazines, semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. if politicians would get the courage to legislate them.
1652 2018-02-18 05:42:38 This really isn’t a good argument against changing gun laws/banning bump stocks/changing background checks/banning ar-15’s
1653 2018-02-18 05:42:36 This is trump/Russia patriotism, let’s sell the uniformed flags and wine. 
What’s the matter, you couldn’t get a gun license to sell kids and the mentally challenged AR-15 ‘s and bump stocks too? You are either a #TrumpTroll or a #RussianBot.

1659 2018-02-18 05:39:37 Do not just blame the FBI.  The weapon & bump Stocks should have been banned. You POTUS stated you would never sign a bill restricting gun sells.  Your fault too

1670 2018-02-18 05:29:21 Bump stocks are not illegal. Not all violent crime means no gun. Domestic abuse for example does not keep you from owning a fire arm. It took my husband less than 10 minutes to get his background check and get a gun, licensing isn’t required for all firearms, no limits on ammo.

1682 2018-02-18 05:19:20 But then there is this so....The bill goes beyond banning bump stocks, it could ban things like aftermarket triggers, bolts, or other components. So..... No. Not quite. Actually no. Not at all.

1695 2018-02-18 05:06:59 Scottrade doesn't seem to allow market orders on OTC stocks. At any rate, it's not the broker. The company went private, but never bought out shareholders and the stock is at no bid. I worked for a company that was privately held but had publicly traded JVs.
1696 2018-02-18 05:06:32 But as you know there are high-capacity mags, bump-stocks, full-auto conversion kits and specialty ammo designed for weapons that were designed for combat. Should have to pass *real* background check, register ownership and be *fully* responsible. Problem with that?
1697 2018-02-18 05:05:56 Not enough Senator. Bill needs to outlaw AR-15s & all other semiautomatic weapons. Ban bump stocks & all other accessories of mass destruction. Enough is enough. That’s the ONLY way to make a difference—all will say what you’re aiming for did nothing years from now-don’t do that.

1701 2018-02-18 05:02:24 Semi-automatic long Guns with bump stocks were used in Las Vegas. That should be illegal.
1702 2018-02-18 05:01:52 For 1 brief moment, I thought there was hope. It was after the Las Vegas shooting when Paul Ryan said the Trump Admin should have rules changed to ban bump stocks for guns. I should have known better. Ryan passed the buck to Trump - who ignored it. I'm sure that was Ryan's plan.

1705 2018-02-18 05:01:04 Universal background checks, ban on bump stocks, ban on assault weapons and reinstate mental health list. That’s where I would start.
1706 2018-02-18 05:00:38 They can focus on OIH with two stocks SLB and HAL.
1707 2018-02-18 05:00:27 I wasn't actually replying to you on that one. I have several guns as well. But the other guy made it sound like a bump stock MADE a gun automatic. I think people hate bump stocks just cause they fear what they don't understand...but yes pointless.
1708 2018-02-18 05:00:00 When the second amendment was written we didn't have bump stocks or AR-15s so​ it was a different ballgame. Times change and amendments can be amended to reflect the times.
1709 2018-02-18 04:59:05 Look at what stocks you were holding 5 years ago. 
Look at today’s price of the same stocks and calculate returns. 
Compare this with what your actual portfolio with churn has returned.
The results may surprise you.
1710 2018-02-18 04:58:12 MP Photography stocks done went up lol
1711 2018-02-18 04:57:54 @FrontRowGrunt 3 stocks barring injury in the next couple of years, coenie, koch, louw, malherbe and tdt. At 1 who do we have? Kitshoff, beast(retire 2019) and trev? Who else? Van rooyen maybe?
1712 2018-02-18 04:57:52 Really?  You are the republican president and the house and senate are republican. What happened to making hump stocks illegal after Vegas?  Stop blaming the democrats for everything you haven’t done. Let’s see you take some leadership. #MAGA
1713 2018-02-18 04:56:30 Universal background checks @ the federal level, ban bump stocks (basically a legal way to make a semi-automatic gun fire automatically (s/o to @JFash_HG for explaining)), ban high capacity magazines, actually enforcing current/future laws and punishing those who don’t follow
1714 2018-02-18 04:55:00 You’re a sick bastard.  It’s not the fault of the FBI.  Enact some laws to remove AR-15s, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks. Show a spine for God’s sake.
1715 2018-02-18 04:54:33 There's a LOT about the Vegas situation that was broken. But people buying guns wasn't the issue. And maybe bump stocks should be illegal but you can achieve the same effect with your belt loop. People who break laws don't care about laws.

1719 2018-02-18 04:49:20 Massachusetts has about the toughest gun laws in the country: license to own/carry; waiting period; background checks; gun safety course; mandatory trigger locks; banned bump stocks. WHY THE HELL CAN'T THE OTHER 49 FOLLOW SUIT?????
1720 2018-02-18 04:48:50 You would... go back to your junk stocks, john. ;)
1721 2018-02-18 04:47:27 Yeah, well, but (to @realDonaldTrump) that is not as important as bashing the FBI...or stopping immigration from shithole countries...or genuflecting before the NRA...or prattling on about infrastructure ("the Wall")...or taking credit for stocks rising (but not falling).
1722 2018-02-18 04:47:02 Isn't it true tho? To some extent at least? Mo investors get in on winning stocks, make it gain more attracting more mo investors.
1723 2018-02-18 04:45:21 So the FBI could have done what? How full would your jails be if everyone who had hateful and violent musings was locked up? Or everyone with a diagnosed mental illness? He shouldn’t have had access to guns let alone assult/bump stocks
1724 2018-02-18 04:44:58 And gotta say - things aren't that good for me, really. Not a tax break in sight. Zero raise for the second year in a row. My retirement stocks plummeted and Im watching closely to see what they do before I retire at the end of this year.
1725 2018-02-18 04:43:57 Bump stocks turn a very good weapon system into a less controllable, unreliable and inaccurate one.
1726 2018-02-18 04:42:52 @DrBeileh is a known thief and political hack by @TheVillaSomalia gangs. He has no experience in how to run an economy. At ADB, he used to maintain bank stocks & storages. Nothing more. Now, he leads the clueless pack of jackals to nowhere. #Somalia #Mogadishu
1727 2018-02-18 04:41:58 NO MORE BUMP STOCKS. NO MORE SEMI AUTOMATICS. NO MORE BS
1728 2018-02-18 04:41:51 Untrue. assault weapons banned. Bump stocks banned. Armor piercing bullets banned - NOT used for hunting. We want ammo regulated and tracked in a database like cold medicine is at the drug store. Too afraid we are making meth, but not stocking up for mass murder! #priorities
1729 2018-02-18 04:41:28 I’m as pro 2A as they come. I’m a collector with dozens of ARs and numerous NFA items. I have a walk in vault. Really. Bump stocks have no legitimate use. None.
1730 2018-02-18 04:40:55 Either way, the $'s toast: If the @federalreserve actually follows through with reverse QE, stocks and bonds are toast. If Powell and Co. don't follow through, the ROW has to make other (funeral) arrangements for a currency that's clearly a #TerminalCase.
1731 2018-02-18 04:40:40 We still know nothing about the Vegas shooting it’s a big cover-up that was no bump stocks the guns were on tripods there after R second amendment it was a set up witnesses there said there was more than one shooter I personally know people that were there this is an attack on us
1732 2018-02-18 04:40:15 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1733 2018-02-18 04:40:03 And how about Vegas? Bump stocks (STILL legal somehow) make them fully auto. 
Upwards of 15 legally purchased AR-type rifles - for what? One purpose. You have to see how broken that is.
1734 2018-02-18 04:39:37 It is not the same thing. In any event, a bump stock does not increase the rate of fire of the rifle to anything close the ROF of a machine gun. Moreover, bump stocks are a novelty and make any firearm it is attached to wildly inaccurate.
1735 2018-02-18 04:38:44 ACLU actually agreed with Trump in that. I haven’t done enough research on it. I definitely think ppl like the FL shooter & ppl with violent history shouldn’t have guns. & I’m for sensible gun laws like getting rid of loop holes& bump stocks as well
1736 2018-02-18 04:37:04 He is a mean looking old fuck he will die with all his money in the casket in stocks an bonds form.
1737 2018-02-18 04:35:21 Wait, now he is leaning more towards the support and talents of the FBI? Perhaps he is just pushing blame on the FBI, when the blame is on Congress and the President for not changing the laws to make it harder for people to get AR-15s and bump stocks.
1738 2018-02-18 04:35:17 This!!!! We don't want your guns,  we have guns. We just want laws.  Back ground checks,  linking the FBI data base with mental health info,  bump stocks....wr don't want your guns!!!
1739 2018-02-18 04:35:10 You mean like getting assault rifles, bump stocks and large clips that's only purpose is to kill large numbers of people quickly, off our streets?
1740 2018-02-18 04:34:22 Sir what about stocks trading at PE of 18 and showing good revenue+profit growth. Ril
1741 2018-02-18 04:34:17 As it should , stronger BG checks , outlawing bump stocks  and 30 rd mags , would not hurt anyone that loves to hunt or shoot for sport , responsible Americans would agree gun owner or not ! – bij Andrew Jackson's Hermitage: Home of the People's President

1747 2018-02-18 04:31:15 I see why you are against the murder bit, but what do you have against bump stocks? Bump stocks don't murder people.
1748 2018-02-18 04:31:13 You do realize bump stocks only give you a very slight increase the rate of fire from what your fingers capable of
1749 2018-02-18 04:31:10 Are the semantics really important to this point? Or is this leading to a discussion about bump stocks?
1750 2018-02-18 04:31:04 Dear Mr. President, if you do what needs to be done you will be applauded, stocks will rise.Americans will love you. FIRE SESSIONS AND WRAY AND RODENTSTEIN. You have the mandate.If you don't act, folks will think you have something to hide as well!!

1754 2018-02-18 04:30:05 Unemployment rates lowest in 10 years. ISIL is being obliterated. Stocks up highest in decades and tax bill passed. Jobs returning to US. And that's after 1 year. Y'all have too much liberal dope smoke messing up your brains.

1760 2018-02-18 04:23:37 How else do you explain your refusal to deal with the slaughter of innocent children? And adults at a country music festival? Folks at church? You puppets couldn't even ban bump stocks.
1761 2018-02-18 04:23:23 high capacity mags are an issue too

I want: bans on high capacity mags, suppressors, bump stocks.
Fed req 30~40hour class on handling, care, & safety to get basic gun license.
No guns for domestic abusers
Verification of guns you own every 2 years (in case stolen/private sale)
1762 2018-02-18 04:22:58 Maybe he would & maybe he wouldn’t. But that’s like saying there’s no point trying to cure someone’s cancer because they might still die of a heart attack. We’re talking about legal guns & bump stocks not speculating on someone being able to create a massive illegal bomb 
1763 2018-02-18 04:21:08 Saw reports in FL with gun purchase must be 21 and 3-day wait period. With rifle (such as AR15), must be 18 and no wait period. No registration? Unlimited buying? “YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!” Still nothing done with bump stocks?  When is the next mass shooting. No political courage.

1768 2018-02-18 04:18:28 You wanna ban bump/slide fire stocks? Fine by me. You have my vote. 

I’m not naive enough to think that’ll change anything as long as people have a thumb and a blue jean pocket, but a bump stock itself serves no purpose, so I’m still with you on that.
1769 2018-02-18 04:18:27 Sir , is it possible to share such stocks with your followers community. , Thanks
1770 2018-02-18 04:18:02 No, it wouldn’t have stopped him, it would have slowed him down if there were no Bump Stocks and no Semi Automatics. Slowing down saves lives. If you can’t figure out how ... ask someone.
1771 2018-02-18 04:18:02 Gop is awash in NRA cash. Won't even ban bump stocks. Makes it easy for anyone to buy military weapons, yet it's the FBI's fault. You took 30 million from the NRA.
1772 2018-02-18 04:17:29 Notably all of those other things you listed are regulated more heavily than guns. There will always be evil in the hearts of men but we need not make it easier for them to externalize that evil through the use of bump stocks and extended mags.  #FloridaSchoolShooting
1773 2018-02-18 04:16:16 Consumer Discretionary Stocks should do well in our Growing Economy—Casinos, Cruise Lines, Boats Vacation homes Etc. But Above all else—I look for Strong Institutional Buying in Every Stock I Start a Position in. Hope this helps.
1774 2018-02-18 04:15:54 You saw what happened in Vegas, right?  What’s the acceptable amount news outlets are allowed to talk about hundreds of people being shot? Because it was like a week. And we did nothing. Didn’t even make bump stocks illegal. Nothing. So again, they don’t talk about it enough.

1777 2018-02-18 04:15:19 The FBI investigated and couldn't do anything save for make a file.  Why are you attacking this instead of writing up bans on semi automatics and bump stocks?  NRA money??

1781 2018-02-18 04:13:12 People keep talking about the AR 15 being an assault weapon, the AR 15 and many rides have the same capability’s such as the Remington 7400 etc both are Black both  have detachable magazines, both can have wooden stocks etc 
1782 2018-02-18 04:11:57 You’re right, we should enforce the laws that are on the books.But that’s not enough!!! There may be future killings but the number of people dead won’t be as high & it will take longer to load that gun.COMMON SENSE,ban bump stocks and semi automatics.Put metal sectors in schools
1783 2018-02-18 04:11:37 The more I want to learn about stocks the more the stock market underperforms and makes me uneasy.
1784 2018-02-18 04:10:52 If you really care about police officers, then do something to make it harder for criminals to get bump stocks and armor piercing ammunition.
1785 2018-02-18 04:10:26 Well, if tRump and his Republican flunkies aren't totally owned by the NRA, then shall we expect some new legislation? Maybe banning bump stocks, or preventing gun sales to violent offenders? Both positions have broad public support. If potus moves on it, then great!
1786 2018-02-18 04:08:49 People never seem interested when I talk about the stocks I’ve invested in which is why I never speak of them or the fact that they’ve risen 87% in the last 2 months and expected to go up another 130-140% in the next month.
1787 2018-02-18 04:07:06 Don't forget bump stocks

1790 2018-02-18 04:03:27 That's because NRA has conditioned them to believe this! One of the reasons bump stocks were not approved was a premise that it's a slippery slope. Once you allow ONE thing, they will come back until they have banned all guns! They won't give an INCH because they make too much $!

1792 2018-02-18 03:59:10 How about you stop profiting from shootings and the NRA / Gun Stocks?
1793 2018-02-18 03:58:40 We don’t need or want a wall. We want safe bridges, roads, and  safe drinking for starters. We also want a ban on assault weapons, bump stocks,large capacity magazines and other weapons of war available to the general public with little to no restrictions. Work on issues we want
1794 2018-02-18 03:55:25 You actually need this an across the board ban of all semi automatic weapons as well as bump stocks.  There's a lot of others.
1795 2018-02-18 03:54:32 @GujralAshwani whenever you are recommending some stocks like goes up /down  it is like that are you the biggest operator or tie up with fiis please let me know
1796 2018-02-18 03:53:48 I believe in and support the 2nd Amendment. I believe in handguns and Stand Your Ground. I don’t believe in AR-15s and bump stocks. We have imposed reasonable restrictions on the 1st Amendment (i.e.,fighting words). What is the downside to doing the same with the 2nd? #NeverAgain
1797 2018-02-18 03:53:34 2) Let the CDC study gun violence.  Ban semi-automatic weapons (like the AR-15) and accessories like bump stocks and large mags. Require anyone buying a gun to get a permit. (Thus taking the onus away from gun shows) Make anyone convicted of domestic abuse surrender his weapons.
1798 2018-02-18 03:53:00 The assault ban wasn’t a ban. It banned 30 round mags and collapsible stocks. Democratic lie
1799 2018-02-18 03:51:48 Would universal background checks violate the 2A? Would banning bump stocks? How about a national gun registry?  Doing nothing is cowardice
1800 2018-02-18 03:51:23 Wait, are we talking about bump stocks or the weapons?  #TryToKeepUp  Or, is your argument that if the AR style guns didn't have the capability to accept a bump stock that they are ok?  So it isn't about the firepower or capacity it's about the potential to modify the firearm?
1801 2018-02-18 03:51:05 Or bump stocks which essentially make a semi automatic rifle a "Weapon Of War"

1808 2018-02-18 03:49:04 when I go hunting with a shotgun, I have to put a plug into my gun so it can't hold more than 3 shells. No one bats an eye about that infringing on the 2nd amendment. But I guess if you're hunting humans it's ok to have large capacity magazines and bump stocks. #GunControlNow
1809 2018-02-18 03:46:47 Not to be confused with "Black's Velvet & Red Coat Warehouse", which stocks velvet-painting painting supplies in every color except black, as well as Revolutionary War re-enactment uniforms. Off Route 6.
1810 2018-02-18 03:46:38 You couldn’t get away with this kind of crap selling penny stocks on the Venture Exchange but in the unregulated market of selling homes anything goes.  Take your deposit back plus 50%.
1811 2018-02-18 03:44:48 Bump stocks are stupid. And so are firearms regulations. 

And so are Democrats. 

HRC said it best.

She said Democrats are stupid and easy to control.
1812 2018-02-18 03:40:57 How about passing a test like we do for driving? How about banning assault weapons? How about banning domestic abusers from ever owning a gun? How about banning bump stocks? I bet gun deaths would plummet.

1815 2018-02-18 03:37:27 I went to buy a AK-876 with a silencer, a scope, and two bump stocks. I didn't have to go through a background check. In fact, the clerk looked at me and winked and said "just take it". #truestory

No automatic weapons and bump stocks
Mentally ill people and felons banned from buying guns
1818 2018-02-18 03:35:15 Are you talking about stocks? Or maybe bonds! no wait, could it be commodities or PM’s? Or maybe real estate?! If it involves $$ it will be manipulated. Economic theory is the biggest scam ever conceived. The math dictates that a few will own all eventually
1819 2018-02-18 03:34:25 This the perfect opportunity for you to show YOU can get it done. Call on GOP Congress to ban AR-15s & bump stocks
1820 2018-02-18 03:34:21 Perfect example.. ex client from 2014... taught him stocks. He’s doing well. Decided to go into #forex and never asked for training thinking he’d do well. He blew his account in 2016.
1821 2018-02-18 03:34:10 It truly is. I'm "debating" another guy that thinks ARs have 3 round bursts. And that the NRA supports bump stocks. Sent him the link that said that the NRA supports further regulations of bump stocks. No reply.
1822 2018-02-18 03:34:07 Looking at the 3-6 uptrent and dowteent cycles and the yearly cycle of bitcoin since birth I see what you're saying. Really just need to look at it in a complete different way than stocks. Appreciate the answer my g
1823 2018-02-18 03:33:11 I stand corrected. I was aware of bump stocks, thanks to the Las Vegas event where 57 people were killed and more than 200 wounded by.... something, because guns don’t kill people, right?
1824 2018-02-18 03:33:11 Agreed on the bump stocks
They're ridiculous

But if the nation's military has autos, the least we can stock is semis
1825 2018-02-18 03:33:11 The name of the store is "Whitey McMural's Black Paint & Grey Coat Coverage Emporium". He stocks black paint & Civil War re-enactment uniforms. He's doing okay.
1826 2018-02-18 03:32:01 I'm not an investor in ICO or stocks but isn't the latter centralised and exactly what we are trying to distance ourself from?
1827 2018-02-18 03:31:19 Are you for your content. Oh I am on the stocks, Kurt.
1828 2018-02-18 03:30:26 Because after the shooting, stocks rose for AR-15 companies and he made money... that’s why he’s smiling, he’s smiling because he’s making money and profiting of the government while he’s in office #horrifying
1829 2018-02-18 03:30:08 Its not easy to convrt an AR-15 to full auto, unless you have a machine shop and some serious skills. There are 'kits' that run $20,000 that allegedly let you do it.

This is just based on quick research across several sources.

I'd worry more about bimp stocks. Cheap and easy.

1831 2018-02-18 03:28:53 No American citizen needs a fully semi-auto that fires high capacity armor piercing bump stocks.
1832 2018-02-18 03:26:11 Oh, that makes me happy and I hope my neighborhood grocery store stocks it soon!
1833 2018-02-18 03:25:32 Could it be bump stocks are unreliable prices of crap?
1834 2018-02-18 03:24:11 My sister is really passionate about make up nd I’m always trying to hop on new releases or re stocks. Especially when it comes to @JeffreeStar,  But by the time i catch wind of when the merch goes on sale it’s all sold out.  I’m just trying to support her on her journey.
1835 2018-02-18 03:23:01 Not making it easier for people with mental illnesses to purchase guns as DJT and GOP did last year? How about outlawing bump stocks?

1837 2018-02-18 03:22:29 The NRA systemically blocks ANY gun control legislation, including laws to screen gun buyers for things like mental illness, domestic abuse and stalking. They also block bans on assault rifles, extended magazines, bumps stocks, etc..etc...etc...
1838 2018-02-18 03:22:22 First of all, yes it’s illegal to do, like killing 17 people is. And the @NRA supports bump stocks too. So we can sure count on them.
1839 2018-02-18 03:21:00 In addition, for the murderously intent, many many “bump stocks” have been sold which immediately make a AK15 fully AUTOMATIC!
1840 2018-02-18 03:18:57 dubbbbb
1841 2018-02-18 03:18:14 Yes. 

What happened after Sandy Hook? We loosened gun laws. Trump made it easier for mentally ill people to get guns. 

What happened after Vegas? Did we ban bump stocks? Nope. 

We can’t protect kids for being murdered because people must have their semiautomatic gun hobbies.
1842 2018-02-18 03:13:00 Me making a fool of myself? You just spent 15 minutes posting memes and emojis making fun of the fire rate bump stocks can achieve because you didn't know what the fuck you were talking about. But yeah I'm the one making a fool of myself.
1843 2018-02-18 03:12:15 But at this point we have exponentially more guns than any other country per capita and we have exponentially more gun deaths than anybody, this is not a coincidence. We haven't even taken away bump stocks when automatic weapons are legal.
1844 2018-02-18 03:12:13 Bump stocks are still legal. Wrap your head around that. How is that even possible?
1845 2018-02-18 03:11:28 @marcorubio Your message after the shooting was so soft and cowardly.  America sees right through it.  Modest gun control can only help, not hurt.  Raise age to 21, make bump stocks illegal, ANYTHING!!!

1848 2018-02-18 03:05:31 I don’t like bump stocks personally. But you can use shoe laces, string, any number of things to make it do that.
1849 2018-02-18 03:05:26 No one is trying to repeal the 2nd Amendment.  But it should have reasonable limits "to promote domestic tranquility, and ensure general welfare."  Raising rifle purchases to age 21, reducing magazines, and outlawing bump stocks might be a start.
1850 2018-02-18 03:05:12 Stocks are up, I finished my web series, im snowed in... good day ppl !
1851 2018-02-18 03:05:00 @mundanematt Can we at least agree, part of the reason EA stocks rose again and BF2 sales were even reasonable were because fence sitters like yourself will still play these titles and speak positively on them despite how exploitative and shallow their progression system was?
1852 2018-02-18 03:04:24 @DraftExpress what are your thoughts about Tyus Battle and Osage Brisset's draft stocks? This year or next year

1856 2018-02-18 03:02:59 1st thing 1st is that he needs to denounced himself from the NRA & give that $30 million he got from them I dunno investing in infilstructure especially for the railways. Then give the American strong intense gun regulations AR-15 gone magazines gone bump stocks gone.
1857 2018-02-18 03:02:32 Gun stocks go up after mass shootings. Thats pretty compelling evidence this country values the second amendment more than people's lives.
1858 2018-02-18 03:02:18 Every cop I know wants to ban assault rifles and bump stocks. Lack of gun control is a big part of the problem. Lack of mental health services is another and Republicans are responsible for both.
1859 2018-02-18 03:02:04 Nope. We want what Germany has. Many citizens owning guns and bans on bump stocks, assault rifles...

1864 2018-02-18 02:58:08 5 billion that went straight into the economy somewhere. That’s horrible. Plus a lot of Americans own stock. Stocks go up. Good for everyone. This is pure class warfare. You got some but they got more. Evil people. You lying Ass!!!
1865 2018-02-18 02:57:43 Btw... bump stocks are STUPID... and was not involved with this incident
1866 2018-02-18 02:56:41 Any clip rifle is capable of firing the same amount of rounds. It can be done with a 22 caliber rifle. So you would have to ban all semi automatic rifles. I bet if you saw an AR-15 with wooden stocks and butt you wouldn't know it from any other rifle. It wouldn't look as scary.
1867 2018-02-18 02:56:35 How do you get stocks from mass shooting? I understand it’s profitable but damn...
1868 2018-02-18 02:55:27 I may have some connections

1870 2018-02-18 02:52:48 @MittRomney How about banning Military Slaughter Weapons, Body Armor, Silencers, and Bump Stocks.  Non Military people shouldn’t have access to these WAR WEAPONS!

1873 2018-02-18 02:52:15 Never join the NRA. They are not pro 2A, they are pro gun manufacturer. They are in part responsible for the NFA, Gun Control Act of 1968, Hughes Amendment, and encouraging BATF to look into banning bump stocks. They treat our rights like they are privileges.
1874 2018-02-18 02:50:15 These people can not answer this because one feels middle class can take care of themselves and other one thinks there is no effort in earning from stocks. And options for you is to become poor , don't work or at best start PAKODA business .You will get a BPL card and NAREGA
1875 2018-02-18 02:47:37 whats your thoughts on founder of etherum ssying they could # cryptos drop to zero at anytime as Im thinking of your emails about mara stocks atm @techinsider_sv
1876 2018-02-18 02:47:17 Do you support comprehensive gun reform, including universal background checks on all sales - private and public, mental health history evaluation, have requirements for locking up guns when minors are in the home, and implement a ban on high capacity magazines and bump stocks?
1877 2018-02-18 02:47:05 as a member of congress he has voted in favor of universal background checks, “No Fly, No Buy” legislation, and CDC funding into gun violence research. Also a cosponsor of the bill banning bump stocks and voted against concealed carry reciprocity.
1878 2018-02-18 02:45:47 You don't even kno about stocks 
1879 2018-02-18 02:44:45 We've had thoughts and prayers after every school shooting since Columbine. Is anything better? Maybe it's a start, but if so, we trip right out of the blocks every time. Are bump stocks still legal after Vegas? We need more than thoughts and prayers.
1880 2018-02-18 02:44:43 To you dumb people who just don’t get it, people don’t want to take away your guns. The AR-15 is an assault rifle, no one should have access to those! We can’t even outlaw bump stocks which HAD bipartisan support and were used in Vegas so he could kill MORE people.
1881 2018-02-18 02:44:34 Killing 17 people is illegal last time I checked. Nothing was stopping him from turning it into three round burst or using bump stocks to make it automatic. @NRA makes sure of that.
1882 2018-02-18 02:43:54 Remember when the stock market crashed before Obama took office, then Fox News was full of gold advertisements?  Democrats bought stocks at the bottom because we had confidence in Obama.  After Trump was elected, conservatives finally rushed into the market after losing on gold.
1883 2018-02-18 02:43:36 Sigh. Don't you have a bible verse to type out? You have done nothing to end gun violence associated with semi automatic weapons, bump stocks or arming the mentally ill.
1884 2018-02-18 02:43:06 Don't worry that's their plan. It's a huge money making scheme. They're going to insert them and then let the stocks plummet, file bankruptcy, and make off with millions. They've planned these school shootings for a while.
1885 2018-02-18 02:42:38 What they mean is, "Let's all invest in gun manufacturers stocks then pass a federal law that requires teachers to be armed, we'll make a mint!".

They'd have no intention of buying guns for teachers.
1886 2018-02-18 02:42:16 J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière. Que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien. Que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines. Que tu me dises que c'est rien.
1887 2018-02-18 02:42:00 Good god, this confirms how dumb you are. Stocks have offered that opportunity many, many times depending on when you bought them, just like with bitcoin. Stocks are much easier to buy than bitcoin for regular people as well.
1888 2018-02-18 02:41:53 There is apathetic and total anti human approach of both executive & legislator in matter of allowing school/ college going kid, mentally unstable person & criminals to have full access & exposure of Gun that to assault rifle, bump stocks etc.
It is time to plug gun regulations.
1889 2018-02-18 02:41:47 Few if any are asking for a total ban on guns - but the assault rifles - the bump stocks and the unlimited clips HAVE TO GO. It is insane to allow the legal sale of these WMD
1890 2018-02-18 02:41:32 They certainly don't make insane amounts of money trading stocks based on pending legislation
1891 2018-02-18 02:41:17 it was either a Nord Lead or reinvest it in stocks and i chose stocks and bills. I'm gonna have one someday :(

1893 2018-02-18 02:39:07 NRA even supports banning bump stocks after Vegas, but Paul Ryan punted to ATF. Amazing leadership.

1897 2018-02-18 02:37:18 Marco, ASK those OFFICERS if they think AR-15s & Bump Stocks should be PLACED BACK ON THE WEAPONS BAN!!! All it takes is ONE VOTE. COULD BE DONE IN 5 Minutes.
1898 2018-02-18 02:36:16 I will not invest in stocks that benefit the manufacturers of assault rifles, their ammo, or bump stocks.
1899 2018-02-18 02:34:43 At the very least he should impose those sanctions. What's he afraid of?

Side note: Ban all military weapons & bump stocks. Make it impossible for those that already have them to never use. How much are you accepting from the NRA?
1900 2018-02-18 02:34:17 Lol whoops ok so automatic is not what i ment... BUT bw a drop in trigger and bump stocks an ar15 is basically an automatic gun
1901 2018-02-18 02:32:11 @coinecon i‘m with you bro, this large VC who put the money is want x14 -x20 return.  so they highly bet on it and will do the hell to make this „coin“ fly... so why not benefit from it as a small ant. like you buy apple  stocks, early VC investor are the main beneficiaries.
1902 2018-02-18 02:31:32 Well @MittRomney unless you are for a complete ban on AR-15, Mini 14, bump stocks, and high count ammo clips I am donating to your opponent.
1903 2018-02-18 02:31:29 Exactly what sensible gun control laws do you want? Raise age to 21? Smaller magazines? Limit number you can own? Bump stocks? Smaller caliber bullets? Bring back the assault weapons ban? Criminals and Mentally ill will not obey, right? Open Border’s = many guns of any type.
1904 2018-02-18 02:30:17 Jersey- 15 rd mag compared to 30, flash suppressor in NJ are illegal ( basically can’t hide where your shooting from), stocks are permanent ( can’t be made smaller to conceal/hide). No bayonet attachment (old school). No forward grip (better shot)
1905 2018-02-18 02:29:25 I appreciate you engaging but it feels like you’re avoiding giving a straight forward question a straight forward answer.
Mechanisms like bump stocks are very rarely used in mass shootings. Assault weapons like an AR15 are very regularly used.
1906 2018-02-18 02:29:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1907 2018-02-18 02:28:57 Bump stocks I agree should be gone. Automatics are banned for a reason and a device that circumvents the law to produce the same effect as an automatic weapon should be illegal.
1908 2018-02-18 02:28:32 No, its how we get away with much of our capabilities gaps and not having high stockpiles of ordnance. We can tap into their vast stocks. That's a big plus for us. Major capability gaps are a different story to ordnance though.
1909 2018-02-18 02:28:12 Yes.... new laws. Assault weapon  ban. No ar-15s for sale. Close internet and gin show loopholes. Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. That’s a start. If you want to shoot a military grade weapon, join the army.
1910 2018-02-18 02:26:50 The same thing can be said about certain mining stocks that make even bigger ROI. I'm not saying bitcoin is worthless.
1911 2018-02-18 02:26:00 I agree to the max @Beautyon_ . I was in stocks made 5/8 a share off the news they let out ! Bitcoin I have made my self a shark . And don't depend on the lies . But I still pay attention just to decode them .
1912 2018-02-18 02:24:54 On things such as bump stocks, yes. All AR-15 style rifles, no. I’m not against changing the classification of AR-15s so that they aren’t in the same category as hunting rifles, because they aren’t. I think strict background checks with domestic abuse, felonies, etc is good.
1913 2018-02-18 02:24:46 It's pretty simple you bathed-in-the-blood-of-innocents asshat, ANY politician Dem or Repub who does not support an assault weapons ban &!elimination of high capacity magazines &  bump stocks, raising the purchase to 21 with licensing & ability requirements should be VOTED OUT.
1914 2018-02-18 02:24:43 Stocks
1915 2018-02-18 02:24:35 The NRA/GOP and a few DEM share responsibility for the death of our children but Weapons Manufacturers should not be left off the hook. Also how many Americans own share of weapon manufacturer's stocks in their 401KKK? #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #GunContolNow #StudentWalkout
1916 2018-02-18 02:23:27 In Canada you can only own a gun for the purpose of hunting. Not for protection, no military style weapons, no bump stocks.

1919 2018-02-18 02:20:19 Bump stocks are not easy to aim or control when trying to make them operate automatically. It isn't their intent.
1920 2018-02-18 02:20:11 You show 'em! Pass those common-sense restrictions! Background checks! Assault-weapons ban! Bump-stocks ban! Get 'er done, Prez! Dems can't do it, but you sure can!

No?
1921 2018-02-18 02:19:52 *the plushies are in limited stocks,tp tak tau la yg lain pun limited gak 
1922 2018-02-18 02:19:30 You should live in Colorado. Where you can just head to the states largest arms dealer-Dragonman Arms. Arm yourself with a flamethrower for Christ sake. How about armed transport? As long as you have the $. Semi auto-matic? Sure. Bump stocks? Sold some to the Las Vegas shooter.

1926 2018-02-18 02:17:10 Dude I don't short penny stocks but I am telling ya I am on the breaking point.
1927 2018-02-18 02:16:16 20000 stocks or 2 million stocks na nandyan tas wala ka paring mahanap? Hahah
1928 2018-02-18 02:15:37 Thousands of full auto weapons were acquired long before they were so expensive, The current prices are driven by paranoid speculation. And you still ignore bump stocks, which have been sold in the millions and are not illegal.
1929 2018-02-18 02:15:14 @maddow Good time to buy gun stocks. Libtard agenda should cause gun sales to skyrocket next week. I'm looking forward to some sweet capital gains.
1930 2018-02-18 02:15:04 I actually like them both. Top 10 stocks rn
1931 2018-02-18 02:14:15 Just took 9 stocks in a crew battle let’s go
1932 2018-02-18 02:13:32 Just to be clear, the right's position on guns is this: *dead children* are an acceptable cost for unfettered access to large clips, semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks et al.
1933 2018-02-18 02:13:07 "wholesaler that stocks large quantities of new books and nonprint materials (audiobooks, videotapes, music CDs, etc.) issued by various publishers and supplies them to retail bookstores and libraries on order, usually at a substantial discount" So, like Baker and Taylor.
1934 2018-02-18 02:11:40 Ok, Mr. “Only I can solve these problems.” Sign an Executive Order baning AR-15s tonight. And ban bump stocks. Make background checks and training MANDATORY. Raise the age of gun purchases to 21. Oh- and return the $30 million to the NRA. #NeverAgain #GunControlNOW

1936 2018-02-18 02:11:14 The bull market in American stocks is aging rapidly.... after that bubble bursts, the real estate bubble will inflate again.   Here we go again...
1937 2018-02-18 02:11:05 @POTUS 
Make legal age 21 on guns, ban bump stocks, make a law guardians can admit kids for mental help after they are 18, mental health help sucks, make it better, armed officer(s) in every school, investigators do your job better and MAKE OUR KIDS SAFE. We will back that.

1940 2018-02-18 02:06:48 Lol do u realize an assault weapons ban is probably the most poorly thought out law in the land?  Hahaha how does focusing on pistol grips and adjustable stocks affect the way a firearm functions??
1941 2018-02-18 02:06:07 ブレンド・Aの映像でジャンプしてる
1942 2018-02-18 02:05:13 How are those gun stocks doing, mr banker man?
1943 2018-02-18 02:04:52 Not enough. Ban high powered weapons. Make bump stocks illegal.
1944 2018-02-18 02:04:04 Oh the NRA will pay her off to shut up as stocks go up at the AR-15 gun manufacturers as sales go up . Only way to stop the madness if people get off their fat ass and VOTE next election .... example: Alabama!!!
1945 2018-02-18 02:03:51 I love not having to buy meat from grocery stores  when my daddy butchers he stocks up my freezer with it 
1946 2018-02-18 02:02:59 There are many gun laws. Perhaps something more is needed. Remember bump stocks? The NRA was gains them when they ended up legal during the Obama admin. I gave an example of a law that might help. Do you agree? Do you have another example?
1947 2018-02-18 02:02:23 Firearms are ingrained in our culture . Semi auto weapons should not be . Sawed off shotguns should not be . Bump stocks should not be .  Many things that existed when we grew up have changed . Blacks and women can vote , you can’t drive drunk anymore without consequence . Change
1948 2018-02-18 02:00:13 The problem is we’ve allowed reactionaries to determine the lingo.  Call Bump Stocks what they are = Machine Guns.  Then they are already illegal and can force gun shops to stop selling them.
1949 2018-02-18 01:59:10 Stocks and crypto will be inversely correlated over time. As more money flows into crypto and out of fiat it’ll leave stocks. People can invest in crypto much easier than stocks. The ICO will replace the IPO. I’m getting bigger returns in crypto, 5-25% on some coins in 1-2 weeks.
1950 2018-02-18 01:58:47 Hi! Are there still lots of stocks for cooky cushion?
1951 2018-02-18 01:57:29 Who cares about manufacturing. You can PRINT extra-round clips and bump-stocks LITERALLY nowadays. You better accept that it's a dangerous world. Toothpaste ain't going back in the tube. 
Better work on peaceful society instead. Bc ppl pull triggers.
1952 2018-02-18 01:57:23 Looking for someone to split this newsletter subscription with. If you're interested in shorting stocks, lmk
1953 2018-02-18 01:55:58 "He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;" ~Proverbs 7:22 #God
1954 2018-02-18 01:55:29 This won’t be popular with the GOP and the gun “enthusiasts”, but I would implement exhaustive background checks, eliminate the gun show loophole, ban assault rifles, bump stocks and extended magazines. I’d also limit ammo sales and tax everything like crazy
1955 2018-02-18 01:54:06 lrt preorders are open for enstars rarepair zine! stocks are limited so get yours while you can!!!

(no we're not the MODs for rarepair but we wanna promote fellow zine contributors!)
1956 2018-02-18 01:53:33 Wonder he had 5k corore worth of stocks at disposal for authorities!
1957 2018-02-18 01:53:11 Thinking of buying a few tech stocks. Contenders are $ADBE, $SQ, $SHOP. Which of these do you think are most undervalued today given their potential?
1958 2018-02-18 01:53:08 Well universal background checks, mental health checks, ban bump stocks and AR-15s would help drastically reduce all these mass shootings. Doing obviously isn't helping at all. We are the only country where mass shootings occur on a regular basis.
1959 2018-02-18 01:52:19 Me too my english is limited stocks... Ahaha... 
#LUCKiligMAYWARDsaASAP
1960 2018-02-18 01:52:10 Democrat bureaucrats are watching their Arms stocks soar as they rant about gun control. It’s the most effective way to boost arms sales.
1961 2018-02-18 01:50:40 More god and more guns, because all that praying, AR15s and bump stocks don't appear to be working...
1962 2018-02-18 01:50:14 Whatever it was, it should already be considered illegal.  All of it! If machine guns are already illegal Bump Stocks should be too!
1963 2018-02-18 01:49:59 We all remember his: I won't let you down.
Many so called draft experts were surprised we did not go for Peter Wright because it would have set up put KPP stocks for next 10 years.
We have been drafting mid fielders since Buckley took over.

1965 2018-02-18 01:49:24 Nothing remains constant in any market. Crypto, Stocks, RE. There is always an ebb and flow, information, technology, and perceptions change causing the underpinning drivers to change with it. Buying $ETH a year ago would be different vs. now, IF it fell to the same price level
1966 2018-02-18 01:48:45 Im done with listening 2 the bollox of tRump supporters. Apparently its not the guns killing people its the lack of discipline & smacks that the terrorists didnt receive as kids One less dense idiot on my fb friends list. Nothing to do with easy access to AR15s & bump stocks then
1967 2018-02-18 01:48:41 And you can also point out how automatic weapons are illegal but guess what still isn't... Bump stocks... Shocker.
1968 2018-02-18 01:46:34 Yeah, and bump stocks prevent arthritis, right?
1969 2018-02-18 01:45:35 Investments, stocks and savings plans really interest me and I think now is the time to think about stuff like that
1970 2018-02-18 01:44:56 Sure it is. Just like they were going to take on Bump Stocks.
1971 2018-02-18 01:44:14 Arms don’t have to include assault weapons bump stocks and large capacity magazines #ImWithTheStonemanKids
1972 2018-02-18 01:43:25 Look, when you can't get bump stocks outlawed after a whacko shoots down 50 people in cold blood, anything is an improvement and I thank her for doing what she can. I wish there were more MEN in the House and Senate that tried as hard as she does. Might make a difference.
1973 2018-02-18 01:42:51 There's a difference between making new laws or policy to address a problem, and 2nd Amendment repeal.  People can find common ground on age minimums and bump stocks which don't need amending the Constitution to do
1974 2018-02-18 01:42:30 So when are you, @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr putting legislation on the floor to outlaw the AR-15, outlaw bump stocks and require background checks and waiting periods?
1975 2018-02-18 01:41:06 The big stocks are propped up until while the rank-and-file stocks drop...
1976 2018-02-18 01:39:50 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1977 2018-02-18 01:39:31 Ohh thank you! If I understand those stocks have been used for pump and dump?
1978 2018-02-18 01:39:02 Bump stocks convert many semi-autos to full auto, and they're not only legal, but exist in very large numbers.
1979 2018-02-18 01:38:47 johnson with the threeee
1980 2018-02-18 01:38:31 Make it a higher rate for higher risk weapons like autos (if they won't ban them) and bump stocks.
1981 2018-02-18 01:38:13 Very unfortunate, I had a lot of big plans with this profit and sets me back big time. I may try to follow shortsqueezes play for a because he seems to pick good stocks at the right time, but always tweets like he bought it at the low and sold it at the high with no evidence.
1982 2018-02-18 01:37:35 Their stocks are ugly as sin
1983 2018-02-18 01:37:12 It seems like America doesn't even want to contemplate any kind of gun control. Bump stocks are still legal.. Something needs to be done. I don't know all the answers, but everyone can't have a gun. It's no way to live.
1984 2018-02-18 01:34:09 HAHA TOO BAD HIS JAB LEADS INTO STOCKS AND HIS FAIR IS SAFE YEET
1985 2018-02-18 01:33:46 And I didn’t say anything about bump stocks. I could care less about bump stocks, if they are finding any way to make these guns more deadly, then regulate that. Again, the problem is the people behind the trigger.
1986 2018-02-18 01:33:40 I'm a gun owner & I'll gladly give up my right bump stocks, ARs, silencers etc.& gladly be limited, checked, banned to keep innocents safe.
1987 2018-02-18 01:33:16 I wonder how many "last" in Ghouta we will get hit with. As long as the SAA can capture the last chemical weapons stocks possessed by the terrorists I will be happy. Booting the last jihadist out will be nice too.

1989 2018-02-18 01:31:43 Are. you serious?! You made it easier for people with mental health issues to get assault weapons! Your party voted to allow bump stocks! You and your presidency are a SHAME!
1990 2018-02-18 01:31:26 Me: Mom I want to do some shopping 
Mom: shop for some stocks 
Me: lmao your kidding right?! Only my mom would say that!
1991 2018-02-18 01:29:35 Bloody Steve, supporting firearms for the mentally ill, bump stocks, and terror in our schools (providing its orchestrated by white people)
1992 2018-02-18 01:28:56 Good time to buy gun stocks.
1993 2018-02-18 01:28:38 "I'm calling my brother. I'm going to tell him to sell my stocks!" #Riffotronic
1994 2018-02-18 01:28:30 You mean slide stocks? There is no possible way to legitimately make a semi-auto rifle shoot at fully-automatic. A slide stock is the closest you can get, and all that does is "rock" the rifle so your trigger finger is quicker
1995 2018-02-18 01:28:11 He seems to forget coca cola contributes greatly to the child obesity epidemic...he used to be the president of that co and profited immensely from that, bet he still does through stocks. Kills more than guns do.
1996 2018-02-18 01:27:10 Personally im for magazine restrictions, banning bump stocks, banning ARs. Basically, a gun has a few uses for civilians, hunting, home defense and recreation. With the first two being much more important. You don’t need an AR for the first two.
1997 2018-02-18 01:26:33 @LydiaCornell Good time to buy gun stocks. The libtards pushing their gun control agenda should cause sales to skyrocket next week. Looking forward to some capital gains.
1998 2018-02-18 01:26:27 Philosophical question of the ages. If Ness in melee successfully 4 stocks a fox and gets hit only once but heals off all the damage by absorbing lasers, is it a JV5
1999 2018-02-18 01:26:25 So you're for sensible gun control laws? Good for you. Succeed where they failed. Close the background check loophole. Outlaw bump stocks. There's much to be done. Go for it.
2000 2018-02-18 01:23:10 Guy in an alley is on the phone comparing selling drugs to trading stocks and ROI...... Lol wut
2001 2018-02-18 01:23:07 Watched your poor TV ‘show’.  Why don’t you provide balanced facts about crypto currency investment compared to stocks plus blockchain tech / blockchain usage / examples. Interview academics / industry crypto or blockchain investors. Oh and real currencies do not form bubbles
2002 2018-02-18 01:22:19 every time the stocks drop, I’m flooding that shit with money. Trump going to make me some chicken this year.

2005 2018-02-18 01:21:08 That ten bucks should get him lots of penny stocks.
2006 2018-02-18 01:20:45 Stocks down.
2007 2018-02-18 01:19:57 But, and this is where it gets interesting, it seems (& this is supported by real-world & math-based studies) if you instead spread your $50k over 20+ startup investments, you have a *very* good chance of a 25% p.a. return.

By comparison: cash is < 2%; stocks ~8%
2008 2018-02-18 01:19:55 While the topic is fresh, here are gun control items I would support:

- a ban on bump-stocks

- raise the age of ownership to 21

- disarm cops and establish public armories for the people's use
2009 2018-02-18 01:19:42 AWB never banned the AR in any effective way. The manufacturers pinned the stocks and sold them with out flash suppressors. They introduced them with names like Sporter and target match and hunting varaints with 5 round mags and fixed stocks work the target barrels.
2010 2018-02-18 01:19:35 Ok I don’t play any on bitcoin or others. I play stocks with dividends and options only
2011 2018-02-18 01:18:35 No, voting NRA beneficiaries out of office, demanding strict bg checks with physical and psych evaluation, 2 week waiting period, no ar-15s or similar, no bump stocks, no private sales, and child lock requirements.
2012 2018-02-18 01:17:21 Bump stocks back ordered?
2013 2018-02-18 01:16:55 Bump stocks aren't however.
2014 2018-02-18 01:16:27 Then explain me why people invest in stocks. I'm treating XRP as a investment and a commodity not as a currency. Ripple Labs do not own the XRP Ledger as it is open-source.
2015 2018-02-18 01:16:02 This wonderful young woman, David Hogg, Cameron, interviewed by Anderson Cooper, give me hope. Of course things can change. AR15, off the shelves, ammo restriction, no bump stocks. NRA out of politics, esp Trumps pockets. The children, wise and tired of no action, give me hope.
2016 2018-02-18 01:15:32 Wait u can cancel on stocks?

2018 2018-02-18 01:15:13 All GOP governors and AGs should demand bans on assault weapons and bump stocks, both in store and online. I heard a local person say, “this is the world we live in.”  No. It is just the US.
2019 2018-02-18 01:14:33 Do you not see how insane it is to say something like “we are sitting ducks” because you work in a school??  NO ONE should have access to guns like AR-15, or accessories like bump stocks or high capacity magazines. Any politician who doesn’t agree, chooses their job over life.
2020 2018-02-18 01:14:32 Bump stocks & gat cranks could be regulated like machine guns. I would be down for that.

Gun locks are already available, given out with new guns. You cannot practically enforce this.

Licenses do nothing except disenfranchise lower income families.
2021 2018-02-18 01:14:23 Almost all parts that make semi automatic rifles automatic rifles are illegal except bomb stocks because they don't technically make the gun full automatic, that's why it wasn't ban
2022 2018-02-18 01:13:53 I agree bump stocks are pointless. How would you feel about armed guards at school and metal detectors like every other government building? I think that would curve this problem but that may just be me.
2023 2018-02-18 01:13:24 I'm robotically impassionate about the #stockmarket and I say go move all human dollars into Nicolet Bankshares Inc. $NCBS #Stocks
2024 2018-02-18 01:13:10 If you want a narrative go out and say very clearly that you support a ban on bump stocks, a min age for gun purchases of 21, and a ban on assault style weapons.I guarantee the media would cover it 100%. But you double talk to try and keep the NRA $$ and our votes, cant have both
2025 2018-02-18 01:11:19 Okay then, fix the problem. Republicans now have both the House & the Senate, so tell them to pass gun control legislation next week. First up, ban AR-15s & bump stocks & require universal background checks.
2026 2018-02-18 01:11:10 Bump stocks are toys. We are being lied to about these shootings. FBI knew and did nothing, LV is cover up, all past mass shootings FBI knew and again did nothing? Why?
2027 2018-02-18 01:10:42 I am not even talking about talking up stocks.. I am talking about normal analsys and saying it will go up here etc .. #itsallinthewording
2028 2018-02-18 01:10:13 Mr President, they say you’re weak, show them you’re strong, your situation is so unique, use it to move this along. Obama didn’t get it done. You can! Straight up and down votes: bump stocks, assault weapons, DACA. Show these losers, make deals
2029 2018-02-18 01:09:02 I think you start with limiting mag sizes and add ons like bump stocks. 2nd doesn’t say anything about ammo. Just saying
2030 2018-02-18 01:08:09 Stocks looking good !
2031 2018-02-18 01:07:42 After Las Vegas they said they were going to talk about bump stocks. Not one word since
2032 2018-02-18 01:06:20 BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS BUMP STOCKS STOCKPILES OF RAPID CONTINUAL FIRE WEAPONS PLEASE PERSIST!!!!!
2033 2018-02-18 01:05:42 In the not so likely case, we do get confirmation of the 350 million in assets, I will a very very wealthy guy. I didnt play this stock because of those assets or business model, I played it because of the chart as I do in most OTC stocks because most of their businesses are bs
2034 2018-02-18 01:05:28 1. Ban individual sales of semi-automatic weapons (e.g. AR-15), bump stocks and clips larger than 10 bullets
2. Allow gun clubs/ranges to be licensed providers for target shooting (using semi-automatic guns) by those who have passed background checks. 
...that's a start.
2035 2018-02-18 01:05:24 Volatility tests your ability. Current trading #strategy is buy stocks 50c-3 dollar price range before ex div offering a good div yield, and dump after payout. Seems like the big funds are doing this way before ex-div. #asx #markets
2036 2018-02-18 01:04:12 I own several guns. I have no use for an "AR". Gunowners need to agree on some sensible regulation or there are going to be some really harsh gun laws coming in the future. We don't NEED high capacity magazines or bump stocks.
2037 2018-02-18 01:03:17 So you like it when it's all about you, so pass gun control.

Reinstate the obama mental health clause you just pulled 

No bump stocks

No semi auto

Universal background checks

Must be 21 to buy a gun

Etc
2038 2018-02-18 01:02:46 They have underwritten for several IPOS. No idea what their personal stock is doing, but it seems that .10 is a strong support level for them. Just waiting on news
2039 2018-02-18 01:01:25 The constitution was written when we had muskets, not AR-15s and bump stocks!
2040 2018-02-18 01:01:08 Thanks much for the Q on @AristaNetworks. Some funds clearly defending their positions in $ANET. But pls see a weekly chart. Big reversal, down 8%, highest weekly vol since 6/2017 #IPO. To me, it signals a deeper correction is possible after such a big run #stocks
2041 2018-02-18 01:00:34 Im opposed to those. Things like bump stocks and extended mags should not be legal or in civilian hands. 

I was merely pointing out: Automatic Assault Rifles are already Illegal
2042 2018-02-18 01:00:10 As your broker, I’m issuing a BUY recommendation for the following stocks:

#daylightsavingsstocktips
2043 2018-02-18 00:57:27 You won’t even talk about a ban on bump stocks, assault weapons, better background checks and closing gun show loopholes!  You are so beholden to the NRA for your campaign. Put families above politics!  Stop the name calling!!!
2044 2018-02-18 00:57:19 Highland Park, Illinois took the NRA N ALEC to the Supreme Court over an Assualt Weapons Ban. They won! Govenors can institute an Assualt Weapons Ban. Failure to do so is a complete dereliction of duty. Bump stocks too! If they do not hear U, vote them out.
2045 2018-02-18 00:57:16 3.3 mil Marco got from NRA , and 21 mil Donald got , u creeps arent letting that influence u r u ?

2046 2018-02-18 00:55:45 Where do you get this SHIT from?  NO ONE is calling for "disarming all citizens"!  That's CRAP. Better background checks? Banning ONE type of of KILLING machine - the AK15 and bump stocks so you can't convert to an AK15? That's NOT "taking away everyone's guns".
2047 2018-02-18 00:55:35 The stock market did crash under trump though and has had big move towards safe gov bonds basically saying they don't have confidence in the stability of the stocks for the next year or more
2048 2018-02-18 00:54:57 Tell Mitch McConnell to bring a gun control bill to the floor and we’ll see. Ban bump stocks, raise the age to get an assault rifle to 21, etc.
2049 2018-02-18 00:54:52 Mr President u got it wrong. I’m former NYPD/retired ICE. We need some firearm laws/regs. No AR15’s or assault weapons for 18 yr olds! Special license must be required, no large magazines, or bump-stocks. I can’t drive an 18 wheeler with a reg driver’s lic!
2050 2018-02-18 00:51:22 While stocks last: Carbonated Pentagons!

2051 2018-02-18 00:50:39 No he will go down in history as a man that tried to make America Great again.  Have you checked your 401k or stocks. I have made a lot. Thank you President Trump.
2052 2018-02-18 00:49:25 The “AR” in AR-15 in fact does not stand for “Assault Rifle” or “Automatic Rifle”; it stands for “ArmaLite Rifle” and is used worldwide as hunting rifle. Any silencing or automatic modifications done to an AR-15, such as suppressors or bump stocks, are done illegally.
2053 2018-02-18 00:49:02 One jerk talks with another jerk.  You are both laughing stocks.

2057 2018-02-18 00:47:19 Also, close the gun show loophole. Make all gun dealers be registered. Oh, and renew the ASSAULT RIFLE BAN! Bump stocks & silencers too. I know @DonaldJTrumpJr has a fetish for silencers. What is their civilian application again?
2058 2018-02-18 00:45:47 Basic US culture condones (right) violence. Video games have been used to train military, Hollywood blockbusters turn US War Du Jour into love stories, regardless of whether or not the war is justified.  Even our daily vocabulary promotes violence. We are susceptible to violence.
2059 2018-02-18 00:44:52 @NRA protect gun owners not manufacturers. No citizen needs an AR15. Hunting rifles, pistols and shotguns can be regulated. Semi automatics, large magazines and bump stocks are unnecessary. The freedom to defend yourself has nothing to do with assault rifles. #CommonSenseGunLaws
2060 2018-02-18 00:44:50 Ban weapons under 21 unless you are in the military or police depts, don't need movable stocks to hunt - COLLECTORS TO HAVE RIGHTS TO ALL WEAPONS - every new owner to be trained to use properly. NO MORE NO LESS
2061 2018-02-18 00:44:42 We can implement common sense gun reform without infringing upon our second amendment rights, which I'll always defend.  Ban assault weapons, ban high capacity mags for everything except rimfire, ban bump-fire stocks, and mandatory background checks for all purchases.
2062 2018-02-18 00:42:28 Does that include bump stocks
2063 2018-02-18 00:41:54 Va falloir refournir les stocks des maillots Lunary vous vendez du rêve comme jamais @LRB_LoL ! (il me faut du M btw)
2064 2018-02-18 00:41:23 Bump stocks are not arguable to me.
2065 2018-02-18 00:41:21 I don’t think bump stocks should even be wanted personally. I don’t even care about the NRA tho. The govt is st fault. Not the NRA. The laws in place aren’t even being enforced.
2066 2018-02-18 00:41:03 Such a poor twitter feed. 2 weeks ago you we’re criticising bitcoin! Why don’t you make your mind up about cryptos / blockchain.  Provide facts about crypto currency investment compared to stocks / crypto exchanges / digital wallets / blockchain tech / blockchain usage / examples
2067 2018-02-18 00:40:39 It's also incorrect to say that *any* gun was banned by the AWB. It never happened. It only banned guns that have a *combination* (more than one) of certain cosmetic features unrelated to the primary operation of the gun (stocks, flash suppressor, etc.).
2068 2018-02-18 00:40:39 Oh, I work as hard as the next guy. You don’t need to be a suit to invest and let money work for you. Don’t have to be rich either, because I’m not. If you have a 401K you have stocks. Put em to work.
2069 2018-02-18 00:40:19 At the very least we need the debate. We can’t even get that on bump stocks. The @NRA has used the “slippery slope” argument & big bucks to stifle any debate.
2070 2018-02-18 00:39:54 Bump stocks too!
2071 2018-02-18 00:39:51 Being held hostage by the NRA so we can't even discuss bump stocks or background checks isn't working, it's actually harming gun rights, because the far left are sick of I & are going to go overboard with demands, better to get background checks, even if there's a ban on....
2072 2018-02-18 00:38:47 Laws we don not currently have but need: ban assault weapons, like they were under Bush until it expired. Ban bump stocks. Also 21 to buy, no sales if mentally ill, domestic abuser or on terror watch list. All good potential laws.
2073 2018-02-18 00:38:15 F’ the wall. We need common sense gun control. No semi-automatic weapons, no bump stocks. No wall.
2074 2018-02-18 00:36:58 The GOP controls the House, the Senate, and the White House and they couldn’t even ban bump stocks. They barely managed to refrain from legalizing silencers. Take you whataboutism BS and shove it up your McDonald’s-clogged colon.
2075 2018-02-18 00:36:16 And yet we’re not just talking about banning bump stocks. The left would have us banning entire types of weapons, like the AR-15.
2076 2018-02-18 00:36:15 Do you not understand stocks? You release dilution after a major rise. $STORM should have at .20
2077 2018-02-18 00:35:49 Then why don't you say we need common sense gun control legislation?  Because the NRA gave your campaign $31 million.  Outlaw bump stocks.  Dems want to talk gun control but all Reps do is offer thoughts and prayers, or a moment of silence.  they never want to talk gun control.

2080 2018-02-18 00:34:22 Ban AR-15s.  Ban bump stocks. It’s the Start to a solution.   Ban people with mental health issues from purchasing guns. Period.  Fund mental health care that the republicans continually cut.  It’s not perfect.  It’s a start.  What’s yours.  Mines on the table.
2081 2018-02-18 00:33:43 Sir, I'm 57, hunted all my life, and have quite a few guns. When everybody rocked wood stocks and traditional blueing, nobody wanted to the them away. Thoughts on barring civilians from owning ARs?
2082 2018-02-18 00:32:05 No assault style weapons, ban them, no magazines bigger than nine shots, no bump stocks, no silencers. Own shotguns, bolt action rifles and hand guns it is enough.
2083 2018-02-18 00:30:40 $INTC is arguably the best tech in the world, and to me, one of the top 3 stocks. Bullish corei7
2084 2018-02-18 00:30:36 Seems sadly true. But in this environment of moral depravity, we need to eliminate assault weapons & bump stocks. Why does any untrained citizen need military weapons? Some Americans still hold values.
2085 2018-02-18 00:30:02 It’s about time @theresa_may dictated to Merkel & her Panzer Group that they can come to us with their offers - until stocks last - which is March 29 2019. We’re leaving them not t’other way round Mrs May...
2086 2018-02-18 00:29:58 BUMP STOCKS DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE NOT A REAL- y'know what? They aren't going to listen.

Just...just let them try. And watch the House and Supreme court smack them around again.
2087 2018-02-18 00:28:34 A thumbs up? Really? Ban semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. We don’t need a wall we need sensible gun control laws.
2088 2018-02-18 00:28:23 Bump stocks were created for people who couldnt use the normal trigger. I had a diagram about speed of bump stops and auto. Bump stop was only a little faster then a semi but not close to a full auto. Plus using a bump stop makes your aim to be off alot so its better to just use
2089 2018-02-18 00:28:22 Admit it, you and your followers put owning a high capacity firearm at a higher priority than you do the lives of our children. Banning assault type weapons, bump stocks etc steps on no ones right to bear arms.
2090 2018-02-18 00:24:43 This is so f'n stupid.  You are really arguing in favor of bump stocks?!?!?  Are your heads really so far up your own asses?  This is just mindless trash.  PS. Love the dog-whistle "Chicago" mention.  PSS. Congrats! Now, @IngrahamAngle can now have you automatons on as guests.
2091 2018-02-18 00:24:42 さっっみ
2092 2018-02-18 00:24:40 My thoughts on things that should be able to pass fairly easily are: 
-banning bump stocks. Word is the ATF is working on reclassifying them to ban them
-raise age to purchase a rifle to 21
2093 2018-02-18 00:24:37 Supply and demand. Holders of the stocks are laughing. If you can’t afford to buy that’s just the way the cookie crumbles. If stock doesn’t sell then price drops. Basics
2094 2018-02-18 00:24:36 Adding more weapons to a nation that already has the most guns per capita in the world will not fix the problem.  Remove the weapons that have the ability to kill the most people in the least amount of time; semiautomatic and peripherals (bump stocks, et al).
2095 2018-02-18 00:23:35 He was the one who approved sales of bump stocks and that added to the deaths in Vegas. I agree there should be some type of common sense gun reform but coming from him this seems like Monday Morning Quarterback to me.
2096 2018-02-18 00:23:32 As of iOS 8 or so, you can delete most of them that aren’t baked in to the system (like the clock or Safari). For a long time, you couldn’t delete Stocks or Calculator.
2097 2018-02-18 00:23:15 Not to mention they are also very customizable to fit the shooter perfectly from receivers, stocks, grips and ever barrels. This doesn’t include attachments. You pretty much got what you got with a shotgun or bolt action rifles.
2098 2018-02-18 00:23:11 Bullshiz you suffered under Obama I don't see a bankrupted country or collapsed stock market I don't see an endless war killing more people than it should I see jobs on the upswing... (until this year) stocks were rising steadily we were on our way into the black then the Orange.
2099 2018-02-18 00:22:33 How did the stocks go last night? Who won? It was Ni champs?
2100 2018-02-18 00:22:11 Nope!  Not good enough.  We need gun control.  Common sense gun control which includes banning semi automatic weapons and bump stocks.
2101 2018-02-18 00:22:02 You won’t ban bump stocks or assault rifles.  You won’t improve background checks. You took heaps of money from the NRA.  You are a fraud.
2102 2018-02-18 00:21:13 At least outlaw assault weapons and bump stocks
2103 2018-02-18 00:20:15 Yeah I can see where you are coming from 110%. But now there are softwares that allow any individual to legally 3D print high capacity magazines and accessories such as bump stocks and muzzle breaks.
2104 2018-02-18 00:20:03 It has been illegal since 1986 to convert a semi auto weapon to fully auto without proper license. Bump stocks are different. They simulate fully auto but any experienced shooter can fire a semi automatic weapon just as fast.
2105 2018-02-18 00:18:14 No AR-15 rifles used in recent mass shootings have been converted to “Machine Guns” I don’t like bump-stocks and they should be regulated but even the Vegas asshat didn’t have machine guns. 1/2
2106 2018-02-18 00:16:24 Fact is, you're placing your access to a cool little toy over the lives of other people. Because there's no other reason to have an assault rifle, or bump stocks, or armor piercing bullets, or extended clips. Opposing #GunControlNow = my hobby>human lives.
2107 2018-02-18 00:13:49 There were armed guards at Stoneman High School (& at Columbine). I am not against having armed guards in schools or against having metal detectors but neither of those things will stop this epidemic if we continue to allow easyou access to assault rifles (& bump stocks).
2108 2018-02-18 00:11:38 check to the day to where born to the day you are requesting a license conducted by the FBI, CIA, and the ATF)
Las Vegas-had 36 different guns(used bump-stocks which made them shoot sort of fully auto as well had bolt action rifles and pistols) PS, you dont have to have a bump
2109 2018-02-18 00:11:28 Happy Hour! Wings! Brewskies! Pizza! Nap! Chores! Check stocks! Pick up kids! Eat dinner out! Phons calls! Night cap! Sex!
2110 2018-02-18 00:11:03 WRT gun control, you control both houses and can enact reasonable gun control measures that a large majority of Americans support. However the NRA owns you and the GOP so nothing will get done. Hell you didn’t even have the guts to ban bump stocks, a gimme putt!
2111 2018-02-18 00:09:48 What a player dan is fitting right in with the team #iambuzzing FLYERS
2112 2018-02-18 00:09:44 You're in love the *idea* of the NRA.  They pour money into politics, block any reasonable gun laws from being implemented, and their stocks and sales go up after mass shootings. If the NRA operated as it should, in cooperation with gun reform, they could promote gun education
2113 2018-02-18 00:09:12 Given unemployment is a lagging economic indicator,the start of a war can be a great morale booster for those that kept their jobs,as their stocks & house prices soar. Meanwhile the unemployed get "Lock-in" (Waiting for work: Janet Yellen 1990). Adding to their "deadwood status"
2114 2018-02-18 00:05:43 Jockey matlab operator n not stocks..lol
2115 2018-02-18 00:05:30 You have all three now (WH), Senate and House. Don't blame others. These mass shootings are on YOUR watch. History will remember the GOP and YOU did nothing. Nothing to protect kids. Nothing to protect anyone. Prove me wrong. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks for starters.
2116 2018-02-18 00:03:15 Yes, I’m sure that folks that were watching Jason Aldean perform in Las Vegas last October 1st think bump stocks are HYSTERICALLY funny. 
2117 2018-02-18 00:02:07 Come on dude, bump stocks are toys. They're super ineffective and unreliable. It amazes me that people  talk so much about things they know so little about.
2118 2018-02-18 00:01:49 Introduce a bill to ban AR-15's and all other semi-automatics, bump stocks, etc. Keep them in the hands of the military and out of the hands of civilian's and local law enforcement.
2119 2018-02-18 00:00:49 Im not saying all guns, i am saying semi-auto, high capacity maga, bump stocks......we i canada have long guns hunting.....i understand 2nd A and would never dream of attempting to remove handguns, but killing war machines.....have no place in civilian society
2120 2018-02-18 00:00:29 Been a pretty shiti week ... credit card got stolen, got a speeding ticket and one of my stocks plumited. Just remember that the sun always rises even after the darkest of nights PRAISE THE FKN SUN LORD ESCANOR LMAOOO
2121 2018-02-18 00:00:22 And that’s why you and your GOP-controlled House and Senate pushed through a ban on bump stocks the week after the Las Vegas massacre. Oh wait, you didn’t, because you and your fellow GOPers are beholden to the NRA.
2122 2018-02-18 00:00:08 I'm for sensible gun control. Stop mass marketing semiautomatic weapons. Stop selling bump stocks altogether. Limit the amount of ammo someone can buy. There's no reason why anyone would need a semiautomatic weapon for hunting or home protection.
2123 2018-02-18 00:00:02 You are doing the same thing! Las Vegas happened on your watch & nothing has changed since then. Bump stocks anyone? How about an AR-15?

2126 2018-02-17 23:58:53 Is it the NRA?  If it’s not that group, chances are your group advocates for laws that won’t work.  At least the NRA advocated for banning bump-stocks after the Vegas shooting.
2127 2018-02-17 23:57:50 Okay, so pass it now. You control Congress now for over a year. Do you care? Oh, you made it easier for people to get guns. You are in the pockets of the NRA. Step up. Ban bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons. I dare you. No wall.
2128 2018-02-17 23:57:45 Huh. Our economy,  unemployment, stocks have never been as good as they are now in our history. What else could you want from a president. America has never done so well

2163 2018-02-17 23:43:21 I haven't been duped by anybody. I don't have an AR. Bump stocks are in very low demand (difficult to time out & can't hit a Target with them). ARs are mostly a marketing iteration; like fins were on old Cadillacs; and the rails are handy for add on lights & such. That's all.
2164 2018-02-17 23:42:40 Vegas shooter used bump-stocks so the death toll would have been FAR lower. Parkland shooter was 19 so he wouldn’t have been able to buy a gun. Off the top of my head, that’s probably 30 or so lives we could have saved in the last 4 months alone with 2 simple law changes.

2168 2018-02-17 23:39:17 All OTC stocks r sh*t holes, u just have to decide what sh*t u r going to trade and hope it works out. If it does not then do not cry or complain, thats the OTC, take it or LEAVE IT....
2169 2018-02-17 23:38:33 most recent mass shootings have been with legally bought guns (& many, with legally bought bump stocks and the like) (see below, I'm sure only when fitted it then becomes illegal). Loophole she meant was u can legally buy semi-auto then legally buy bump stock at show
2170 2018-02-17 23:38:33 Just curious, which enforcement actions did you have in mind? I saw some movement against penny stocks trying to pump on Blockchain marketing yesterday.
2171 2018-02-17 23:37:46 which stocks are you invested/interested in?
2172 2018-02-17 23:34:56 Ban bump stocks, universal 2 week background check, no gun buys unless 21, 10 round magazines max, register your gun and pass test for usage just like car. Keep your gun.
2173 2018-02-17 23:34:25 They're just fools repeating what they heard. A AR15 is not an assault weapon. A M16 is, because it's a weapon of war. Having a pistol grip, 30 rd magazine, and stocks designed to attach lights, optics, lasers, and bipods does not suddenly make a semi auto rifle an assault weapon
2174 2018-02-17 23:34:04 Glad to have purchased some Stocks when DOW dropped down to 23k...timing is everything!
2175 2018-02-17 23:33:53 Right stocks up, countries paying us and investing, your a buffoon
2176 2018-02-17 23:33:50 I TOTALLY agree BlueBreeze. So easy to add  (& legal to buy) bump stocks etc. Fact that congress won't make illegal just shows how greedy they are (being bought by the NRA who are bought by the manufacturers). No sensible reason NOT to ban bump stocks
2177 2018-02-17 23:33:41 I swear to god torrid only stocks three pairs of each size pants in their warehouse.
2178 2018-02-17 23:32:05 Thanks @CoachMattPugh, she is struggling with a couple parents really trying to tear her down right now.
2179 2018-02-17 23:31:26 Remember, most recent shootings have been with legally bought guns (& many, with legally bought bump stocks and the like (see below, I'm sure only when fitted it then becomes illegal)
2180 2018-02-17 23:31:17 UBC, better training requirements for concealed carry, mental health reporting, DV restrictions, no bump stocks sales, no silencer sales, allow CDC to gather data, drop the war on drugs and take all that money and manpower to track down criminal gun sales.
2181 2018-02-17 23:30:31 Democrats are also to blame but the GOP majority in both houses has blocked all gun control initiatives, including banning bump stocks and requiring background checks on a national level.  I don't expect anything will get done until it directly impacts family members of Congress.
2182 2018-02-17 23:30:08 The AR-15 was, in fact, designed as a military weapon, according to the manufacturer. And there is no justification for having such weapons available to civilians, much less bump stocks and oversized magazines.
2183 2018-02-17 23:28:27 Told a player this just a couple weeks ago....why do you care what others think when they don’t want what you want???
2184 2018-02-17 23:28:15 I don’t want an outright ban on firearms. Just things such as bump stocks, large capacity mags, and assault rifles which can take out large numbers at once. If you want a bolt action rifle for hunting, a handgun for self defense, or a shotgun for sport shooting, that’s fine.
2185 2018-02-17 23:26:56 You obviously don't know much about guns. Bump stocks are fairly easily made at home.
2186 2018-02-17 23:25:21 Aww :( actually medyo mahirap nga sila mahanap 'cause they're not in the same place..minsan nasa ibang tables ung kasunod na books. And syempre di sure kung marami silang stocks din. But you have a nice haul! Some of the wala nung preview day 
2187 2018-02-17 23:24:14 He’s right though. 90% of Americans want to close gun-show & gun-gifting loopholes, ban bump stocks, and assure seriously mentally ill ppl don’t get access to guns (like the FL shooter). It should be mandatory gun owners w/minor or mentally ill family members lock guns up.
2188 2018-02-17 23:23:39 Just sad that we have teach our children how to save their lives in school shooting. However, we won't talk about getting rid of bump stocks and semi automatic rifles.. so over folks

2191 2018-02-17 23:22:29 Haha yeah agreed... It mucks up my social life as well..during the day stocks and indices, in the evening crypto and fx and weekends crypto
2192 2018-02-17 23:21:24 Once again...

Bump 

Stocks 

Are

Not
2193 2018-02-17 23:18:55 It’s not. It’s absolutely not. Trump gets 15% tax cut thanks to his pass thru LLCs. The rich get huge cuts AND the corps are buying back stocks. I bet you don’t have many. Pumps share value and cash returns
2194 2018-02-17 23:16:30 Democrat/progressive vocabulary lesson:

COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURE: Confiscate all rifles with pistol grips, black plastic stocks and scary looks.

#tcot #GunContol
2195 2018-02-17 23:16:11 NO ONE is asking Americans to give up their 2nd Amendment rights. AR 15 is NOT a right. Bump stocks are NOT a right. Extended magazines are NOT a right. How many gun owners are members of 'well regulated militia'?
Bill Clinton DID do assault weapon ban. Scalia agreed.
2196 2018-02-17 23:16:05 we need a national ban on AR15 and all assault rifles, large clips, bump stocks, and we need universal gun registration laws, limits on # of guns that can be bought and tracking on ALL gun sales nationally!! We will vote you out!
2197 2018-02-17 23:15:33 I trade indices especially the Dow all the time very little stocks now and dipped my toes into LTC
2198 2018-02-17 23:15:13 We can do Our American part & set an Example for the GOP by Boycotting Any and All products Imported from Russia & Associated  Nations: Liquor, Clothing, Petroleum Products, Software, Businesses, Banking, Stocks, etc. This just got Way Serious! We've done this before!
2199 2018-02-17 23:14:27 AR15 is not fully automatic. You can convert it but if you get caught your ass is in a world of trouble. Even with a bump stick you cannot fireat the same rate. Bump stocks are very hard to use and takes a lot of practice.
2200 2018-02-17 23:13:31 Dirk, that is exactly it. Pricing for a live saved is worth way more than the $200/day or whatever the cost is. Until this happens, antibiotic markets tough for stocks.
2201 2018-02-17 23:13:21 Right and how much did your campaign spend again working with #Facebook ?  No reason for them to try and shift narrative after the #intelligence agencies all confirmed the agenda.  Nothing to do with #stocks in their company.  Like #EmmaGonzalez .... I call #bullshit on you & #fb
2202 2018-02-17 23:12:31 Security Bank stocks finally recovers. Wondering if I should sell it now considering its performance so far. #StockMarket
2203 2018-02-17 23:12:25 Im trying to focus on more proffesional designs i dont want make shitty cod gfx with 300 light stocks
2204 2018-02-17 23:12:23 I grew up with guns, hunted to spend time with my grandfather, and still have a rifle. Having said that: I don’t need semi auto with a 10+ round magazine to hunt or defend myself. Period. 2nd Amendment was based on slow powder loaded guns not semi auto, bump stocks, n large mags.
2205 2018-02-17 23:12:03 I should have said “intraday Trading” not many stocks double in 6 hours
2206 2018-02-17 23:09:41 Can't easily argue with that, but I also think you can understand and agree, even if partially, on my point. It's kind of different from the average boss you find on a job. Taking it to the extreme, who's my boss when I trade stocks w/ my money?
2207 2018-02-17 23:09:13 Stocks to watch next week: 
 
$KODK $AAPL $AKS $CUR $ROKU $YTEN $AMD $AMED $TNC $CHH $ANAB
2208 2018-02-17 23:08:56 Bump stocks though
2209 2018-02-17 23:08:53 Agree..a ban on bump stocks.. Very reasonable..ANY modification to make a semi auto to full auto should be banned..They already limit the magazines to 10 rounds and that is reasonable..But anyone caught in excess of that size magazine..Automatic 3 yrs in the slammer...
2210 2018-02-17 23:07:27 Machine Guns are prohibited  by law from sale  with all  weapons  that fire in the Auto  mode. The AR 15 fires semi  Auto as fast a one can pull the trigger. Everyone  can buy Semi Auto weapons.   Bump  stocks modify to fire Auto, approved by Obama Admin.
2211 2018-02-17 23:06:46 No matter what we say they will say the "Second Amendment" and the GOP and Half America does not care how many Shootings or How many People Dies if they did they would have banded "Bump Stocks" or even talked about background checks at  gun shows ! Good luck !
2212 2018-02-17 23:06:06 all possible --- but some REAL money can be made if loading pot stocks next week or so before it actualizes that connection. If the correlation is going to continue, looks like 100%+ opportunity in short time in many pot names.
2213 2018-02-17 23:05:36 Our forefathers has muskets in mind.  Not semi-automatic weapons with bump stocks.  With this crazy pro gun logic we should all have the right to a nuclear arm.
2214 2018-02-17 23:05:26 If anyone is looking at currency  war people are selling dollars  selling stocks selling companies selling homes selling businesses the Baby Boomers are ready to retire from business, as you wish my people, may you meet king nothing; our great wizard and qonos father of Jesus
2215 2018-02-17 23:04:36 But yeah I definitely agree in the last months there have been some striking similar fallings st the exact sametime between bitcoin pot stocks & later on in Dow Jones but I think the underlying factor there must be just volatility in general in a high paced high risk marketplace.
2216 2018-02-17 23:04:32 Common sense gun laws don’t mean banning all guns or even certain types of guns, it’s about whom has access to them and how easy they are to obtain. I also know NOTHING about firearms but does a flock carry the same amount of rounds? Can a glock have these ‘bump’ stocks?
2217 2018-02-17 23:04:18 fine, let's talk about las vagas shooting..how's the ban on bump stocks going
2218 2018-02-17 23:04:02 Any and all semi automatics need to banned as well as bump stocks.  There's no logical use for the general public that stands up.  Common sense regulations and stop this from happening.
2219 2018-02-17 23:03:53 Top 10 stocks making New 52 Week Highs: $ARMO $GLOB $ALKS $X $NVAX $CARB $IMGN $MULE $MSBF $ESP #Investing #Stocks #Daytrading #Bitcoin
2220 2018-02-17 23:03:12 So you going to no longer excepting donations from the NRA? You’re going to make automatic rifles illegal? You going to finally make bump stocks illegal?  With every breath you take lie.
2221 2018-02-17 23:01:39 The argument that I heard about pot stocks and the Dow is that there is a delay
2222 2018-02-17 23:01:04 Remember Bump Stocks!
2223 2018-02-17 23:00:57 No. You will do the right thing and ban assault weapons, bump stocks and large mags for guns! When you do that, than talk! In the mean time STFU! The children are speaking out NOW!
2224 2018-02-17 22:59:10 Always happens!!! The weatherman definitely buys grocery store stocks!
2225 2018-02-17 22:58:42 BTC bottomed on Feb 5 ... Canadian Pot stocks bottomed on Feb 5.... and Dow bottomed on Feb 9 ....
2226 2018-02-17 22:58:35 Bump stocks are accessories to make it easier to 'simulate' full auto fire but you dont need a bump stock to do that. Honestly I think our kids are so desensitized by violence in video games and movies they don't understand the gravity of what they are doing.
2227 2018-02-17 22:56:16 Little asterisks with regard to pot stocks though due to the unanticipated Sessions announcement which certainly played a major role in crating the defined top in Pot stocks.
2228 2018-02-17 22:55:46 Well let's take a quick look at the sequence ... $DJIA $SPY are the tertiary indicator, it has lagged both pot stocks and BTC and started its "crash" on Feb 2nd. Pot stocks are in the middle, starting its "crash" on Jan 3. BTC leading both with its crash starting December 20.
2229 2018-02-17 22:54:44 I know now I bought it. Enjoyed watching it. One day maybe get her to do the envelope challenge or guess the mess, or even the stocks..
2230 2018-02-17 22:54:43 Geary that would take an amendment to the Constitution. Thus it wouldn't happen. 

Magazines, bump stocks, and background checks..no constitutional change needed.
2231 2018-02-17 22:54:22 Disappointed that @theJagmeetSingh and @NDP won’t stand against the pipeline. Urgency of low fish stocks, declining whale population and climate change should be why we take a stand, not to avoid division. #cdnpoli
2232 2018-02-17 22:53:44 Lions. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency are currently catching a nice bid-I expect that come Tuesday, (the next day equity markets here in the US open), if crypto continue to gain, stocks will gain as well.
2233 2018-02-17 22:52:41 AR-15s and similar rifles are actually fairly popular for the purposes of hunting. They're more accurate, and have higher effective ranges than a lot of old hunting rifles, on top of the polymer bodies being lighter than a lot of wood stocks.
2234 2018-02-17 22:52:30 If you take all the guns from legal gun owners, all that is left are illegal gun owners. The issue isn't all guns are bad. It's that these psychopaths are getting them and even if you ban them, just like bump stocks, people will get their hands on them/make them
2235 2018-02-17 22:52:22 AR-15’s are not sold with bump stocks. The Florida shooter did not have a bump stock. What right do you have to tell me, a responsible citizen, what kind of gun I can and can’t have? I’m waiting ......
2236 2018-02-17 22:51:53 Forgot @dirtydc13 #peskyflyers #greatgame 
2237 2018-02-17 22:51:28 Eubank losing his discipline it’s important Groves stays on his zone and this is and always was going to be an easy night providing he stays switched on a stocks to his gameplan.
2238 2018-02-17 22:51:10 Got question how much cash I hold 70pct 30 some stocks & options
2239 2018-02-17 22:50:38 Not!!!! Expensive bump stocks are very unreliable! Not even close to the same as an automatic weapon! Stop with the stupidity!
2240 2018-02-17 22:50:37 I do think that market going back to ATH would provide the most favorable enviornment for both BTC & pot stocks -- & a market crash would provide the least favorable enviornment. Correlation is very strong between the two risky assets, but there is also a correlation to market.
2241 2018-02-17 22:50:22 Won doubles at Quit Your Friendlies with @SDXssb from losers with a CONVINCING 6-0 over Blacktwins and IModerz (they put us in losers)

I think we got 3 5 stocks
2242 2018-02-17 22:50:09 Master's 24/7 boi wants to take me to a party as my dom for the night. He knows a place where I would be put in stocks and spit roasted by a few guys. If Master says I must go I will have no choice. Not a good prospect but I have signed a contract. Fuck.
2243 2018-02-17 22:49:38 [helldude stocks go up by 500%]
2244 2018-02-17 22:48:36 @GrooveCubeMusic always smack with mac stocks ?!?
2245 2018-02-17 22:48:24 Wow Donny, big sacrifice. How about some meaningful gun laws? How abt starting w/something easy like bump stocks to give you time to find the courage to outlaw the mass murder weapon of choice: AR15.
2246 2018-02-17 22:48:07 We're so sorry but this promotion has now ended! Codes had to be entered by Jan 31, 2018. Boxes may still be on shelves while stocks last.
2247 2018-02-17 22:48:00 @WPBF_Gianna Great report on Gun Ban demonstration today. Congress MUST outlaw Assault Type weapons especially bump stocks & large capacity magazines as well as people with mental issues must not be allowed to purchase weapons.  @RepLeeZeldin @RepPeteKing @foxandfriends @POTUS
2248 2018-02-17 22:47:37 says: "Volume is not important"

-uses volume as a parameter when screening stocks.
-doesnt trade illiquid (low volume) stocks

"fundamentals are not important"

-checks news when stocks run
-trades Earnings plays

Gotta love the hypocrisy & vanity of twitter clowns

#hilarious
2249 2018-02-17 22:46:51 Why do we need automatic weapons to kill more people?  Why do gun owners need silencers to protect their ears?  Why are bum stocks so available?  STOP NRA insanity!!!!
2250 2018-02-17 22:46:15 I used to think never but now I can see it. He’s rich but as he gets older, he’s probably thinking about securing his family for forever, and having them write their own chapter in wrestling as he cements his legacy. Only way to do that is to turn stocks to liquid by exiting.
2251 2018-02-17 22:45:59 Bump Stocks convert guns to an AR weapon.

2253 2018-02-17 22:44:53 For decades we have been over medicating our children, desensitizing children to violence, legalizing pot so kids think its no big deal to bake their brains, Watch the war on kids there you will have your answer.  No bump stocks and smaller magazines will help.
2254 2018-02-17 22:44:47 Found out my local beer store stocks like two or three shelves of Belgian beer including lambics so I’m doomed basically
2255 2018-02-17 22:43:46 I'd rather be a rich pussy than a @tetherprinter bag holder.  I will make plenty of leveraged money on bitcoin's demise given the crypto-hype stocks.
2256 2018-02-17 22:43:43 Ok since you asked
Eliminate gun show loop hole
Restrict large capacity mags
Mandatory background checks
Bump stocks
Ban military grade guns
2257 2018-02-17 22:43:20 Same can be said about the Dow Jones to though it won’t basically step for step with crypto and cannabis stocks and when the Dow started taking dips so did all three ...  I think it’s just a greater correlation to volatility overall in my opinion
2258 2018-02-17 22:43:08 Thanks for reaching out Jonnie-FDIC insurance covers funds in deposit accounts (checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit). This disclosure refers to investment and insurance products (stocks, bonds, life insurance policies), which are not covered.
2259 2018-02-17 22:42:55 @kfc today was the day that the chicken stocks ran dry!! The colonel would not have been happy
2260 2018-02-17 22:42:34 Going to make a solid effort to post my open and closed positions as well as stocks I'm watching once I'm back from vacation. Need to really put myself out there if I want to up my trading game.
2261 2018-02-17 22:42:10 @DebbieLesko Where do you stand on semi automatic weapons  and bump stocks?
2262 2018-02-17 22:42:04 It is also clear .. or seems to be at least .. that the LEADING asset class has been btc/crypto and the LAGGING asset class has been Pot Stocks. So, this BTC bottom happening before a strong MJ bottom makes perfect sense within that context. Would expect a week or two lag.
2263 2018-02-17 22:41:51 When the second amendment was written you had muzzle loaded hunting weapons. Now we have semi-automatic assault rifles with bump stocks.
2264 2018-02-17 22:41:08 @FifeFlyers what a fab result. That was a real team out on the ice tonight. Same again tomorrow night and the conference is ours @C_Schaber @CharlieMosey @A_Iles33 @elcreido18 @Stocks_68 @nucci39 @bloodz_25 @dirtydc13 @Heeels @RussMoyer
2265 2018-02-17 22:41:06 Coorelation doesn't mean they have to have anything to do with each other --- all it means is that an increase in the price of one results in in an increase in the price of the other. And vice versa. The mania run in btc from nov-jan was mimicked by a mania run in pot stocks.
2266 2018-02-17 22:40:51 Not thoughts and prayers. Policy and action on two fronts: outlaw repeating rifles automatic weapons bump stocks.  Empower young men as children with love, special education and community support.
2267 2018-02-17 22:40:15 Dude you are in fantasy land, just like the Republicans. Their tax scheme relies on growth rates that are not within the scope of reality. Corps are NOT creating jobs, they're laying people off and buying back stocks with the tax cut money. You know ZERO about how this works.
2268 2018-02-17 22:37:13 Oops we did it again another 2pts , well done guys  @nucci39 @CharlieMosey @elcreido18 @Heeels @jisaacs5 @PeteyL88 @C_Schaber @RBirzi @Stocks_68 @Josh_Scoon @dirtydc13 @jjorgensen15 That's how we roll, #OnToTheNextOne
2269 2018-02-17 22:36:16 Banning semi-automatics and bump stocks does not infringe upon the constitutional right to bear arms. People would still have the absolute right to arm themselves.
2270 2018-02-17 22:35:45 @jerimickelberry I love your idea of a mother's march against gun violence.  I am not totally anti-gun but feel that semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks have no place in civilian homes.   They're the weapon of choice for mowing down children.
2271 2018-02-17 22:35:44 Yea it’s dead cuz they be releasing  colorways almost every 2 weeks.. they gotta stick to OG colorways and start retroing past colorways like once every month or two.. with limited stocks
2272 2018-02-17 22:35:32 Ceux la sont du site chinois  uwowo, ils ont fait des soldes récemment (j'en ai eu pour 25 euros/tenue) mais je crois que c'est terminé, ou à voir selon stocks sinon ils feront d'autres soldes + tard (commandes de 200$ pour avoir les fdp gratuits donc je passe par des groupes )
2273 2018-02-17 22:35:21 Whatever "fundamentals" are "supposed" to move a market... in reality liquidity moves markets, & if markets as a whole are "risk-on" stuff like crypto & pot stocks see heightened liquidity and volume .. in "risk-off" settings, they both get worked much harder than "safer" assets.
2274 2018-02-17 22:34:54 When trump leaves office stocks are gonna crash so make that bread while you can
2275 2018-02-17 22:33:55 14 day waiting periods
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements
Minimum age of purchase at 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban
2276 2018-02-17 22:33:49 In my non-professional opinion, I suggest that you guys should buy stocks in banks esp bdo, bpi and secb. These will take so much income based from loans extended in 2017 and 2016 for increase of car purchases. 2018 is all about TRAIN and will greatly affect other sectors.
2277 2018-02-17 22:33:26 But for argument's sake ... you're being too simplistic in your rationale for why there is no correlation. How about ultra spec high risk investors/traders, both pot stocks & crypto are extremely speculative and thus likely involve many of the same traders. Just food for thought.
2278 2018-02-17 22:32:54 The guns in Las Vegas were equipped with cheesy "bump stocks", not converted to automatic. The church shooter was shot on the way out, *after* he'd massacred the church goers. What's the point of spreading incorrect information?
2279 2018-02-17 22:32:48 it's  Semi-Automatic Weapon & does that really F***ing matter? Automatic-Semi-Automatic-Bump Stocks- They have no business in Civilian hands! There's no reason for it you can protect yourself w/a handgun you don't need an AR-15!
2280 2018-02-17 22:32:24 How about only allow the sale of hand guns, by which I mean pistols and revolvers and instigating proper background checks and cool off periods.  With rifles for hunting which are single shot at a time, limited magazine, no bump stocks.  Buy backs would be good too
2281 2018-02-17 22:31:23 If you have low stocks- high inventory

And every mass shooting you sell out of that same guns.
How is that NOT fueling domestic terrorism
If gun shop owners need #FFL so does gifting, selling or exchange.
The manufacturer, the gunshop owner & the loopholes.
Foreign OR DOMESTIC
2282 2018-02-17 22:30:57 I agree 100% with you HIPAA laws need to be changed. I think that you should have to be 21 years old to buy an AR-15 civilian type. Bump stocks are stupid and need to be heavily regulated. There's no doubt it's a slippery slope. It's not the weapon it's the evil in the people.
2283 2018-02-17 22:30:37 what AI and IoT emerging stocks do you think are promising?
2284 2018-02-17 22:30:05 City of Denver just outlawed bump stocks
2285 2018-02-17 22:30:01 Immediately after Vegas, we were told by our leaders that it was "too soon".  Then they never got back to it (hmm, coincidence?)  Paul Ryan put some word salad together about bump stocks and then did?  Nothing.  G, they always say "too soon" to deflect.  Don't be naive
2286 2018-02-17 22:28:52 Special licenses to have semi automatics. And things that make weapons more dangerous like bump stocks should not be sold. Period. I agree with that but having us defenseless because of a few crazy people were allowed to by guns which they shouldn’t of been able to buy which we
2287 2018-02-17 22:28:21 Prochaine fois on vide les stocks, mais j'pourrais plus conduire faudra rentrer a pied xD
2288 2018-02-17 22:26:57 Dude, AR-15 has larger magazine, higher accuracy and range, less recoil.  And that’s not even mentioning bump stocks and expanded mags that can increase lethality.  To claim they are equivalent weapons shows you are completely ignorant about firearms.
2289 2018-02-17 22:26:30 3) limit sales of ammunition.  No one needs thousands of rounds of ammo.  Period.   4) Make the illegal sale of a weapon, or use of an illegal weapon in a crime such as murder automatic death penalty.  5) Bump stocks would be illegal to sell.
2290 2018-02-17 22:22:55 Does that mean we all get to rewind 3-5 yrs too?? Oh man im gonna put all my money into weed stocks
2291 2018-02-17 22:22:32 thinking about 'investing' in 'stocks' so that i may 'retire' before i 'die'
2292 2018-02-17 22:22:28 So I just heard my manager say that we all get bean stocks for working at Starbucks so once we quit, we get our moneyyy
2293 2018-02-17 22:22:19 It's also too easy for a crazy person to kill a lot of people with a gun because of the types of guns and fun people-killing accessories you can buy - like high capacity mags and bump stocks.
2294 2018-02-17 22:21:25 These newspapers have made laughing stocks of themselves
2295 2018-02-17 22:21:01 Why is the AR-15 the psychopath's weapon of choice in the USA (and clearly it is) if an handgun will mow down kids just as fast and as well.

Do they sell bump stocks for handguns? Can you snipe effectively with a handgun? Same caliber?
2296 2018-02-17 22:20:31 Makes about as much sense as not realizing the limited upside to shorting stocks. As taxes go to zero, debts skyrocket, and interest becomes an increasing percentage of GDP, this flower is going to wilt.
2297 2018-02-17 22:20:21 If you are so concerned about saving lives and protecting lives  AR-15‘s, AK-47s, bump stocks shouldn’t be your highest priority. If you’re so concerned about saving lives don’t ban guns ban abortions
2298 2018-02-17 22:19:18 (1/2) We should have shown initiative to fix issues with sensible gun legislation after Sandy Hook. But then wasn’t time to politicize(AKA find a solution). We should have banned bump stocks after Vegas. We should do something now, but our politicians won’t.
2299 2018-02-17 22:18:57 A large part of using a low-energy missile effectively is knowing the engagement envelope. I wonder how COIN air campaigns might change if insurgents could use their limited stocks to their full potential
2300 2018-02-17 22:18:56 Stocks can go straight to zero too !
2301 2018-02-17 22:16:48 gotta start investing in stocks
2302 2018-02-17 22:16:02 We need a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks
2303 2018-02-17 22:14:58 No one needs bump stocks, or semi auto weapons. It's not what the 2nd 
Amendment was about. We need back ground checks, time limits, on and on
2304 2018-02-17 22:14:56 Hmmmm, I’ll give them more chances. It’s still early on for consoles so hopefully it’ll develop and people will improve. Although capitalizing on enemy gorillas is especially strong and can steal wins due to shared stocks. Some people seem just uncarryable
2305 2018-02-17 22:14:25 There is resistance in TIME for several key US Stocks for Fri 16th and Mon 19th Feb. These are MSFT, AAPL & NFLX.
2306 2018-02-17 22:14:15 Yeah but in Germany they are out of stocks from months... And if you want to buy from retailers you pay like 1.400$ for a 1080 ti.
2307 2018-02-17 22:13:55 Will get a little more information this week regarding thesis that #PotStocks  (especially Canadian MJ) is trailing/following #Bitcoin #Crypto market. If we see bitcoin continue higher & close this week in the 11-12k range, MJ stocks should see a bump if the correlation is real.

2309 2018-02-17 22:12:10 School safety? What are you going to call for when someone shoots-up a school bus(s)? Armored buses? BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP-STOCKS NOW!   #StonemanShooting
2310 2018-02-17 22:11:36 Ban bump stocks/bumping the firearm (yes I understand you can't ban a shooting style), high capacity mags, mental health screenings, communication between military courts and FBI firearm database for violent offenders.
2311 2018-02-17 22:11:10 does anyone know if most targets carry love yourself CDs? i know that target in general stocks it but I’m just wondering if I have a good chance of finding a copy bc I’m going to check tonight
2312 2018-02-17 22:11:10 BAN AR15s, bump stocks, and extended mags.  Not needed to hunt anything but people.
2313 2018-02-17 22:09:15 The constitution mentions AR-15s and bump stocks but not lawn darts? Didn’t know that!
2314 2018-02-17 22:08:40 TRUMP HOW ABOUT SKIPPING YOUR NRA DONATION AND YEARLY KICKBACK AND BAN AR-15’S AND GUN CONTROL ON ALL ASSAULT RIFLES, BUM STOCKS, BAN THEM ALL! SKIP THE NRA DONATION NOW!!!
2315 2018-02-17 22:08:26 How can we have a reasonable discussion involving say the AR 15, bump stocks ect when the radical far left shows their true colors and intentions when a mass shooting occurs. Fact is, they don't want gun control they want a gun ban period, and at any means necessary.
2316 2018-02-17 22:08:18 @FifeFlyers one word WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO @Josh_Scoon @jjorgensen15 @bloodz_25 @Chadmister10 @Marrsy33 @elcreido18 @C_Schaber @CharlieMosey @nucci39 @hutchy071 @RussMoyer @TheHorseTM @A_Iles33 @PeteyL88 @Stocks_68 #letsselloutdundee #peskyyers
2317 2018-02-17 22:07:31 Closing a privately owned gun shop for a few days does NOT send a "powerful message" about gun violence. A powerful message would be refusing to sell assault rifles and bump stocks. #ImWithTheKids
2318 2018-02-17 22:06:17 I think the example here is that the best is yet to come from these various technologies that are cutting edge today...just maybe in the next bull, not this one. #stocks
2319 2018-02-17 22:05:56 About bonds, I'm lost now. Not buying. Sold my High Yields back in December.  Now only stocks. Better returns. :)
2320 2018-02-17 22:04:05 HOW MANY KIDS NEED TO DIE? There is absolutely no legitimate reason why a private citizen needs to own a semiautomatic weapon like an AR15. These should be banned, along with bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. It is time NOW. #MAGA #Trump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @NRA
2321 2018-02-17 22:02:49 There's a reason the Dow had the highest AND second highest drop in our entire history of the stock market within the same month. That's due to the reduction of regulations allowing high volume trading of volatile stocks, which created a bubble.
2322 2018-02-17 22:02:42 ...I recall in 1995 there were only four large stocks that were so-called Internet stocks: Netscape, UUNet, PSINet, and Spyglass. People thought they would be *the* ones to own. The real Net stocks came out later & drove the '98-'00 frenzy #stocks
2323 2018-02-17 22:02:16 I’m in total agreement. Bump stocks have no place in the civilian world.
2324 2018-02-17 22:01:45 Danville Power Lifting Meet: Jake Stocks finished 2nd in his weight class out of 73 and Brenden Workman finished 6th out of 35. Keep working hard, fellas!

2327 2018-02-17 21:58:28 I'd disagree with the author that stocks and bonds are "traditional assets." Real property & gold are the most traditional assets. Life savings were not held in corporate stocks and bonds until the middle of the 20th century.

2330 2018-02-17 21:55:23 Legal age to buy, 21. No “bump stocks”. Guardians can admit over 18 children for mental care. Liberal HIPPA laws need to change. Mental health sucks and needs to improve and stop killing unborn BABIES!! That is by far the biggest mass murder in the history of the world

2334 2018-02-17 21:53:53 no one wants to take away 2A rights, only bring about common sense law: ban military grad weapons and bump stocks, universal, more in depth background checks, longer wait period. if just one life is saved it’s worth making it harder
2335 2018-02-17 21:53:48 In 1 yr of stocks i made 50% ROI and was more than satisfied. Over da past 10 days of cryptos i have doubled my money yet i feel like i can do better. Da days of percentage returns being seen as good investments are gone! We talkin in multiples for returns in cryptos my bruddas!
2336 2018-02-17 21:53:48 It is also a tradeable instrument with specific market structure issues that didn’t exist historically when it was a mere observation.  Not opposed to selling vix in Principle.  Also think haters need to admit vol selling helped stocks
2337 2018-02-17 21:53:41 I will no longer vote for any politician that refuses to advocate for common sense gun control. AR-15s are ridiculous. Same for high capacity clips and bump stocks. Be a leader Please and take action.
2338 2018-02-17 21:52:52 Massachusetts outlawed bump stocks and required owners turn them in. As of 2 weeks ago, guess how many were turned in? 3. Total of 3.
2339 2018-02-17 21:52:51 Question to you. Do you think that it’s sensible for bump stocks to be legal?
2340 2018-02-17 21:52:31 I'm confused. When stocks increase, the price of shale rises? 

I guess that's a risk if you're talking about countries acting as monopsony buyers...but is it accurate to think of "China" as just one buyer?
2341 2018-02-17 21:51:32 Maining one or two characters you’re confident you can carry with especially in this game where people can lose 2 of your 3 stocks within a minute or less is effective. I made the mistake up to now of switching around a lot and the early ranks are tough to carry.
2342 2018-02-17 21:50:29 Bombs, Cars, for Mass Killing are from HATE GROUPS. Here's where the 1st Amendment should NOT be ALLOWED by HATE GROUPS Period, & these groups should be Disbanded. In Charlottesville did you see the "Guards" of a Hate Group ALL carrying ASSAULT Rifles, maybe with "Bump Stocks"???
2343 2018-02-17 21:49:14 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-16, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (5/6):
2344 2018-02-17 21:49:03 No we don’t. We need background checks on all sales (including private). We need mandatory safety training and registration. We need semi-autos and devices like bump stocks banned, with a buy-back program. The 2nd amendment isn’t sacrosanct.
2345 2018-02-17 21:48:29 No.  Bump stocks just make it easier to achieve what someone competent can already do.  That same competent person can fire that weapon more accurately as well.
2346 2018-02-17 21:47:30 No God didn't force Americans to wrap themselves in the second amendment which was passed to allow citizens to rise up against a tyrannical government and make it so anyone can compile their own personal by legally purchasing semi automatic rifles and bump stocks that allow them
2347 2018-02-17 21:47:15 Yes, but let's do want is reasonable and prudent to make it harder.

The Constitution doesn't Grant you a right to large magazines, semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, or military grade assault rifles.
2348 2018-02-17 21:46:50 Om US verkligen skulle ses som EM land så ska riskpremien på US stocks upp rejält och då har vi typ -25% på SPX. Men den inprisningen tror jag inte på.

2354 2018-02-17 21:44:09 One option is to stop the sale of AR-15s used in most of these killing sprees! Bump stocks too. Or can you control the mentally ill in our society? Something must be done.

2358 2018-02-17 21:41:43 Thank you, we need common sense gun laws like banning AR-15s and assault rifles from civilian day to day access, ban high capacity cartridges and bump stocks. How can we proceed?
2359 2018-02-17 21:41:39 Let me help YOU first bro. Instead of banning gun. Just ban assault rifles & bump stocks. Save your thoughts n prayers

2368 2018-02-17 21:35:00 When you say guns are easily modified, explain? Florida wasn’t modified from what I know. The bump stocks in Vegas are illegal in some places and more coming I’m sure. But no two shooters are the same so interchangeable stocks are necessary.

2370 2018-02-17 21:32:49 For like 48 hours after Las Vegas, even the NRA seemed open to the idea of outlawing bump stocks, but they quickly went back to OPPOSE ALL DISCUSSION and the GOP quickly got in line.  It's sickening
2371 2018-02-17 21:32:28 Me at 12: "what are stocks and bonds"
Me at 26: "....but what are stocks and bonds"
2372 2018-02-17 21:32:25 Fully automatic yes, semiautomatic no. Civilian fully automatic deaths are very rare even though if criminals or nutters really wanted to break the law they could get one. At least ban bump stocks & other mods for semis and register all ammo no matter the gun type like Swiss do.
2373 2018-02-17 21:31:50 Ugh. So sad. Can't even keep illegal bumper stocks on the shelves. We're nuts, that's the problem. Somewhere we off the rails. Way off.
2374 2018-02-17 21:31:38 A ban on bump stocks? I know they can be easily modified but it will be less accessible

2377 2018-02-17 21:31:21 Huh, I wonder if the Toys R Us in my area also stocks import stuff like this, too.
I know EB Games occasionally does, which is nice.
2378 2018-02-17 21:31:07 There is always a need to say, “this is important and part of X, let’s put in here” but also allow it to be part of Y, linked to Y, share metadata from Y etc. Turn knowledge flows into stocks, especially since the volume of flow increases
2379 2018-02-17 21:30:25 Anyone FOOLISH enough to have their DNA in a database only proves how ignorant many Americans are.

2395 2018-02-17 21:15:01 Learned lot from Adler re FED's (& CB's) closed loop primary dealer banks as mon pol transmission mechanism for QEs & schedules for FED swapping FNRs (cash) for banks' MBS. Once banks had cash how 2 deploy cash was discretion of banks (in business distribution & markup - stocks)
2396 2018-02-17 21:14:38 I appreciate you taking time to respond. This does have a negative side effect if it makes it to stocks. Many traders trade intraday charts this could remove liquidity by expanding hours and also increase risk.
2397 2018-02-17 21:14:33 What about the $500M+ owed to Russian banks (all connected to Putin) & the quid-pro-quo on sanctions? The VA Secretary’s travel-gate? Tom Price bought/sold Healthcare stocks in Congress while writing laws on healthcare (still confirmed by GOP to HHS post).
2398 2018-02-17 21:14:11 I don't like it when the stream layout is set up in a way that makes it so it's hard to see a player's stocks.
2399 2018-02-17 21:13:21 This is something & a tiny step in the right direction. But it's not nearly enough. There is no need for this type of weapon to be in *any* civilian hands. We do not need semi (or fully)automatics - including bump stocks- on the street. At all. Full stop. Take a damn stand!
2400 2018-02-17 21:13:14 IMHO doesn’t look like a big deal, he owns $ >2b worth of stocks...
2401 2018-02-17 21:12:26 Yeah, I had no longs at the beginning of the week but had 10 single pivot longs by end of the week. Seems like 'normal service' in stocks might be resuming but who knows!
2402 2018-02-17 21:12:20 I wouldn’t doubt it one bit. Look at Vegas Shooting Massacre, MGM CEO sold 80% of his Stock the day before the shooting and why did Soros, Podesta, and other big Democrats sell MGM stock before the Vegas shooting? Stocks were up 100% since feb of 16.
2403 2018-02-17 21:12:00 NRA is for common sense background checks no bump stocks etc. Millions of guns 30 yrs ago. What happened?
2404 2018-02-17 21:11:49 Want to be angry? Think what gun manufacturer stocks will do when the markets open Monday.
2405 2018-02-17 21:11:17 We know how this plays out. Token conversation in NRA-owned congress.  Do nothing.  Leave it to the states.  Just like bump stocks after LV.  Bump-stocks for gods-sake!  That wasn’t even a hard call.
2406 2018-02-17 21:10:52 Here is a proposal we should put to AZ voters with revenues going to General Fund or perhaps @MayorStanton & @JRothschildAZ can make it a city tax: Handguns & ammo- 25% tax, SemiAutomatic Rifles - 500% tax, Ammo - 3000% tax.  High capacity magazines & bump Stocks - 10000% tax.
2407 2018-02-17 21:10:50 Also, no buying guns for someone else, same rules apply to online sales and gun shows. Also, no silencers, large mags, bump stocks, hollow point bullets or anything of the like.
2408 2018-02-17 21:10:49 Bump stocks aren't even the issue. If anyone wishes to convert a rifle to full auto, it's not very difficult. The real issue is with our society, it's not the guns. We are being psyoped, our public ed indoctrination, & I can go on. I'll msg you later if you want on this subject.

2410 2018-02-17 21:08:51 Bump stocks make semi-automatic weapons rather automatic like. You also can't effortlessly kill 17 children with a bat. You can't kill 58 people at a concert from a hotel window with a bat or golf club, either. #GunControlNow
2411 2018-02-17 21:08:15 An AR15 shouldn’t b any person’s choice. It’s sole purpose is 2 kill people. That is why the military use it & that is where it should stay. Own handguns, hunting rifles, shotguns, but this 1 needs 2 go away along with bump stocks & large ammo clips. Curb mass murders where u can
2412 2018-02-17 21:07:45 Don't cloud the issue. Guns in general isn't the issue. Military style assault weapons in the hands of civilians is. No civilian should own a gun that can shoot 30 - 45 rounds per minute with bump stocks and huge magazines.
2413 2018-02-17 21:07:27 Despite my comment that this mkt reminded me of the 'Nineties, there is no comparison in terms of power in the Nasdaq:

Last 18 mos: +64%
Last 18 mos of 90's bull: +278%

2414 2018-02-17 21:07:13 I truly don't believe that most ppl, including Dems, want all yr guns. It is assault weapons & bump stocks that allow ppl to create mass carnage in a brief period of time. Most of us realize that we cannot stop all of it, but I also believe we can do better. We must eliminate  /1
2415 2018-02-17 21:06:55 This seriously has nothing to do with a CCW. This has to do with an AR-15 and is being used to slaughter children across the country. An AR-15 should not be accessible to purchase a gun store. Bump stocks should not be accessible to purchase at a gun store.
2416 2018-02-17 21:05:19 I hate when people give me homie stocks. Let me accept my mistake
2417 2018-02-17 21:05:14 After every #MassShooting, #Americans may talk more about #GunControl but the facts are that gun & ammo purchases go up & related stocks go up instead of down -- so they're having the opposite effect. It also creates more #Fear & #Division. I'll leave it at that.
2418 2018-02-17 21:03:38 Well I guess that means time to sell marijuana stocks. Especially since the juvenile gun grab they were trying to achieve blew up in their faces. Another low energy dem plan crashes and burns.
2419 2018-02-17 21:02:28 Why are bump stocks still legal? After Las Vegas, both sides were fine with them being illegal. The NRA even put out a statement saying they should be reviewed and yet, nothing. It just shows how ineffective the Gov't is when both sides agree and still don't get anything passed.
2420 2018-02-17 21:02:04 This is a discussion about mass shootings not all violent crimes and AR-15’s are prevalent in mass shootings. Along with bump stocks. The Vegas shooting couldn’t have occurred with a hand gun. They lack penetration power and accuracy at a distance.
2421 2018-02-17 21:01:56 1950 baby handknitted capelets - cardigans ( pure wool with silk thread edges ) / French new old stocks
2422 2018-02-17 21:01:50 There are signs that you are unstable and yet you are still in the White House. Oh wait,  you’re golfing. You should be working with congress on stricter gun laws. Ban AR 15’s and bump stocks. Metal detectors in schools. Screw that money for the wall.
2423 2018-02-17 21:01:25 Definitely get back into stocks, mornings with high volume are unmatched, in my opinion way better then trying to day trade fx
2424 2018-02-17 21:00:25 14 day waiting periods
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements
Minimum age of purchase at 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban

#GunReformNow
2425 2018-02-17 20:59:30 @jimcramer Jim do you believe we are in for more smooth sailing gains in stocks or are we headed for volatile ups and downs for a period of time?  It looks to my amateur eyes as tho we have had a correction and its back to trading on the strong economy? Am I correct? Jeff "77STHS
2426 2018-02-17 20:58:23 Mostly futures and fx, been thinking about getting back into stocks. ES, YM and CL mostly
2427 2018-02-17 20:57:47 I believe and support the 2nd Amendment as much as I do the 1st. However, we have sensible restrictions on speech (fighting words; clear and present danger). Why cannot we not take the same approach with the 2nd, banning bump stocks? What is the downside to reasonable reform?
2428 2018-02-17 20:56:40 I swing the fx market, and daytrade stocks in the morning, been thinking about getting in CL though too, how bout you?
2429 2018-02-17 20:56:37 Personally, I could go either way on bump stocks and am pretty militant with the other stuff.
2430 2018-02-17 20:56:26 That's true but damage to the health of the average American has nothing to do with profit. 
It can be an ugly game.
I've been long war stocks for years 
( $LMT, $BA, $GD, $RTN, etc.) and they have made great gains.
2431 2018-02-17 20:56:16 Handknitted 1950 playsuits in pure soft wool / French ,new old stocks
2432 2018-02-17 20:55:24 And hopefully you agree that civilians have no business owning guns like AR15s or accessories like bump stocks.
2433 2018-02-17 20:53:59 Awsome 1950 baby playsuits ( pure wool ) / French new old stocks
2434 2018-02-17 20:53:10  not at all, looking forward to seeing how the Saffron/Coro story unfolds. Always good to hear your view on recent news and hot stocks whether justified or not!
2435 2018-02-17 20:52:27 Right, they didn't foresee bump stocks, AR-15s, and sub-machine guns as arms in households.
2436 2018-02-17 20:51:51 I’m not against some gun control laws, bump stocks, large mags i don’t feel civilians need. I know in Wisconsin background checks and 3 day waits are already in place. I do think there is a lot more then guns are the problem.  Theirs been semiautomatic rifles for a hundred years.
2437 2018-02-17 20:51:34 Not letting any new "assault weapons" be sold, eliminating bump stocks, etc. will make it harder for wannabe mass murderers to do get them as time goes on & there are fewer around. Add to that no private sales, required background checks, & the right people will hold onto theirs.
2438 2018-02-17 20:51:16 This isn't a bubble, and the inflation target has little to do with anything. Yes, stocks are overvalued, but the bigger picture is that the labor share of national income has collapsed over the past 40 years; a high P/E ratio is the new normal.
2439 2018-02-17 20:51:12 3. If you outlaw bump stocks, something else will be used to do the same thing. I've heard people who say they can do the same thing by holding their finger in a certain way. I don't know. I've never tried. It's a waste of ammo.
2440 2018-02-17 20:50:30 You’re going to put you safety in the hands of this government? No me. Yes, there should be restrictions on bump stocks(I’m assuming that is what you meant). Full autos have been illegal to purchase since 1986.
2441 2018-02-17 20:48:50 Je fais mes stocks à tous les évènements étudiants  ça fait des économies xp
2442 2018-02-17 20:48:44 Did you ask any of them need an AR 15? Except for their hobby? Didn’t think so.  Or bump stocks? Did you ask them why civilians need military weapons, except for their hobby?
2443 2018-02-17 20:48:34 OMG  I hope Asda stocks this new Ben and Jerry’s I need to try it drool 
2444 2018-02-17 20:46:56 Problem is bump stocks are an accessory that doesn't impede your right to a fully functioning weapon.
2445 2018-02-17 20:46:45 I’m sure you were speaking up when Obama approved the sale of bump stocks. I think since you didn’t you owe some Vegas victims and apology.
2446 2018-02-17 20:45:44 Congrats @facebook you are now a friend of the white supremacist president! Facebook is a cancer infecting this country and the world. You are all accomplices in the attack on our country's election. Looking forward to your stocks tanking and your company collapsing.
2447 2018-02-17 20:45:05 Do you own gun stocks? @Fidelity @AmericanFunds @TIAA @TRowePrice @Vanguard_Group @CalPERS @pensionsnews #UnloadGunStocks #DivestGuns
2448 2018-02-17 20:44:15 I work as official under O’Rourke & worked on the x3 too. I’ve known Marty forever. I’m not on FB but have stayed in touch with a lot of people. Going over to Hank Kramar right now to watch the race. He’s my neighbor in NC ran figure 8 & street stocks #35
2449 2018-02-17 20:42:57 @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump PLEASE ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks!!  As a mother I’m begging you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
2450 2018-02-17 20:42:48 I friggen wish! by customizable I meant attachments/stocks/grips/sights. As far as the mechanics it’s semi auto, one trigger pull one bullet. You’d have to do some serious machining to get one to go full auto
2451 2018-02-17 20:42:38 1. Universal background checks already exist.
2. High capacity mags. Pointless. Changing a 10 round mag is easy, but under high stress in a life or death situation, I'd rather have the higher capacity.
3. Banning bump stocks is another pointless measure, but I'll give it to you.
2452 2018-02-17 20:41:41 Technically it isn't full auto but that's pretty much squabbling over technicalities, given that bump stocks effectively transform the "civilian" semi-automatic version into a fully automatic one.
2453 2018-02-17 20:40:02 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks
2454 2018-02-17 20:39:36 Thanks mate, appreciate the comments and sharing etc.

Tried to get the info out without waffling too much, certainly a few key snips of info if your into a few of these stocks. If not I hope It wasn't to boring lol
2455 2018-02-17 20:39:16 Bump stocks Don't turn these guns to fully auto. The emulate fully auto which can be done with your belt loop on your jeans. I appreciate your passion but you need to do more research on guns.
2456 2018-02-17 20:38:40 New and biggest plan is a 5 year goal to reach my first mil stocks and forex is something im learning and investing in to become more educated and build more self net worth making money slowly but i will get there with the dedication i have for striving to accomplish this
2457 2018-02-17 20:37:57 1. Ban the sale/possession of assault weapons and accessories like bump stocks, punishable by life imprisonment. 
2. Allow dealers and citizens to voluntarily surrender them for tax or $ incentives 
3. Send the ATF to collect the rest
4. Outlaw sale/purchase of guns at gun shows
2458 2018-02-17 20:37:21 No, all legally bought semi automatics, and had legally bought bump stocks. So what do you think the reason no full automatics have been used?
2459 2018-02-17 20:37:01 Really? Cause Trump undid Obama reg on guns and Vegas happened on his watch (also 18 school shootings this year alone) with no action even against BUMP STOCKS...so there's THAT
2460 2018-02-17 20:36:56 I can no longer turn a blind eye to bump stocks and magazined rifles.Saying guns don’t kill people is akin to saying an aggressive person with a knife is not any more dangerous than one without.I know as well that all regulation is a slippery slope.Good intentions lead to hell.
2461 2018-02-17 20:35:19 I'm not talking about any of those things. Here's what I do want: universal background checks, restricting high capacity mags, banning bump stocks.

2463 2018-02-17 20:34:18 If it is a rapid fire gun it needs to be banned! You people make me SICK! You are playing games while CHILDREN ARE DYING! Nobody thinks you are funny! Jesus! The #GOP couldn't even ban Bump Stocks after 550 people were shot in LAS VEGAS!
2464 2018-02-17 20:34:12 @LukesDrugMart stocks a lot of fun toothpaste!

2466 2018-02-17 20:33:29 Wonder if that was accurate since a lot was left out, but private sales to no one under 18 is probably something that could be passed with emphasis on not delaying the bill by tying other things in, like a bipartisan bill to ban bump stocks that the GOP & NRA support right now
2467 2018-02-17 20:33:20 Stocks with gd hit on cownie at the boards
2468 2018-02-17 20:32:32 Everyone should support the High School National Walkout on April 20th..the anniversary of Columbine-with marches and protests in favor of gun control including a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks and for raising the age limit on buying guns.
2469 2018-02-17 20:32:32 Gorgeous!!! Need to see them in the double stocks being tickled by @uktickling
2470 2018-02-17 20:30:47 “Sinks Leinster’s season” is a bit dramatic?? I’d be more concerned about the dwindling mid field stocks!!

2472 2018-02-17 20:28:49 Who wants to lob one dart at a time?  I've got some nice bump stocks so that you can strafe them with little effort.
2473 2018-02-17 20:27:08 Military grade weaponry isn't all guns. An AR15 at 18 but a handgun at 21 ? Repeal Trump's repeal of background checks ? Buy back schemes ? Ban bump stocks and silencers?  Compulsory registration with and independent assesment by gun clubs before purchase permitted ? Just thought
2474 2018-02-17 20:26:39 Any responsible gun owner does this already.  Background cheeks already are in place. Bump stocks should be regulated which most people and @NRA support.  Who decides what people are allowed to have? Government? Don’t think so.
2475 2018-02-17 20:26:16 Ion kno shit about these stocks n shit I jus invested I don’t understand none of this paperwork

2480 2018-02-17 20:21:52 I’m gonna jump in here. Ban military style assault weapons & bump stocks. Hunters don’t need to kill deer & turkey. Many more people r die when those weapons r used & doctors say survivors of mass shootings have much much more damage.

Bump stocks to be made illegal? Nothing , Not a damn thing!  So whatever Trump the Russian traitor & GOP say means nothing

2561 2018-02-17 20:16:01 We want common sense gun laws. We aren’t talking about banning all guns. We’re talking about banning bump stocks, banning assault rifles. We’re talking about a stricter process to own a gun. It shouldn’t be a partisan issue.
2562 2018-02-17 20:15:37 Yes. We need to ban assault weapons and bump stocks. It is time for all legislators to put families above politics!!  Please do you
2563 2018-02-17 20:15:05 The 1934 law said rifle barrels could be not shorter than 16 inches precisely so they could not be concealed. New ones have removable barrels and stocks, so the whole gun is no longer than 16 inches. One has a barrel that simply folds up or down. So, call them concealed weapons.
2564 2018-02-17 20:14:36 Denver has outlawed bump stocks for rifles. The Denver Police Department wants gun owners who have the devices to turn them in. Today the Police Chief issued a clarification: "Everyone should turn in their bump stocks, except for illegal aliens. We can't touch those people."
2565 2018-02-17 20:14:05 You sound stupid! What we should do is ban assault rifles and bump stocks! Teachers do not want to carry guns!

2569 2018-02-17 20:10:24 They run on these issues all the time. But they won’t execute on anything. And if they do, it’s either meaningless crap like “bump stocks,” or, like I said, no compliance and they just ignore it.
2570 2018-02-17 20:09:51 And you can still buy Bump Stocks (Slide Fire), just further proof most politicians do not care about We the People only their pocketbooks
2571 2018-02-17 20:09:40 In Canada Ar-15 guns are illegal!!! Nobody can get them. Only gun crimes we have are with handguns. Handguns can't slaughter like an AR-15 and then you have the friggen bump stocks. Can't even bam those in the US. The world doesn't get why US loves guns.
2572 2018-02-17 20:09:02 The VAST majority of weapons sold today are semiautomatic. This just demonstrates you are a poseur.  And if you knew what the rules are with respect to automatic weapons, you would know it's not an issue.  Bump stocks, I agree with you.
2573 2018-02-17 20:06:48 What you need to get rid off is not just guns. It is gun culture. The fact that 15 y/o kids find «exciting» to learn to use tools designed to kill people. That guys learn about hollow point bullets, laser sights,  tactical rifle stocks, and quick release holsters. Get other hobby
2574 2018-02-17 20:06:39 Banning assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity mags MAKES IT HARDER FOR MASS SHOOTERS WHY IS THIS FUCKING HARD????
2575 2018-02-17 20:06:28 Lage raho. Keep patience and trust your stocks.
2576 2018-02-17 20:06:15 You might want to check with the 90% of the New York sporting rifle owners who refused to register their "assault rifles" ordered by the Safe Act. Or the Massachusetts owners who have refused to turn in their bump stocks. Get ready for civil war if you try to take them!
2577 2018-02-17 20:05:47 Absolutely! And of course they would have rather had a Trump victory than Hilary; after all, wasn’t it Trump et al. who sold them 20% of US uranium stocks? That was Trump, right?

2583 2018-02-17 20:02:36 2) stocks are legal and I believe the cost is around 50.00 these turn semi autos into fully auto weapons. I think the best answer to this...
2584 2018-02-17 20:02:36 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2585 2018-02-17 20:02:32 Everyone is looking for 1 thing that will solve the problem but what is needed is a multi-prong approach. Ban AR-15's and bump stocks.  Regulate ammo. Better background checks. Free mental health care. Better education. Less glorification of violence. But start somewhere!
2586 2018-02-17 20:01:45 I am not a Con but might have been a Rino one day if it hadn't gotten bastardized. 90% of the country knows this stuff has gone too far w/ bump stocks, silencers, ARs, etc.
2587 2018-02-17 20:01:30 I didn't say that they made the weapon fully automatic, I said that they mimicked auto fire while still technically remaining semi automatic. Even if it can be mimicked with a finger alone, stocks facilitate that and make it easier to do.
2588 2018-02-17 20:01:01 Most of these mining stocks are completely garbage stocks what makes this one the winner? I have a tiny position here from .10 judlst based on the chart at the time. It looks like they spend a lot of money marketing aka selling their stock. Where's the value? I don't get it yet
2589 2018-02-17 20:00:34 I get asked to write about junk stocks and provide exposure. I only cover high quality companies such as @OrocobreLimited @AdvLithium @NeoLithiumCorp and select others. My primary focus is #energyevolution #energytechnokogies and #energymetals. Be careful, there is a lot of junk!
2590 2018-02-17 20:00:22 I'd love to see a ban on the sale of semi automatic rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks for a start. Then a national database of gun ownership, required training to obtain a license and mandatory insurance that pays out in cases of accidents and assaults.
2591 2018-02-17 19:59:51 Maybe next step is encouraging stockholders to divest and stop buying gun manufacturer stocks such as is done with big resource companies. #NRA gets most of its $ from gun manufacturers, not memberships. #guncontrol
2592 2018-02-17 19:56:28 Stocks
2593 2018-02-17 19:56:20 I agree with most of this. While I support 2A, I do believe we need mandatory gun safety/storage training, better background checks, written/practical tests, bump stocks should be illegal, outside of hunters no-one really needs a rifle, a handgun is enough for self/home defense.

2595 2018-02-17 19:55:24 It'd be a huge nerf that might bump a few top tiers down to high tier or mid tier, but seeing characters die to ladder combos at 25% in a game played with only 2 stocks...
It kind of makes me wish there were a no-rage option, just as an idle fantasy.
2596 2018-02-17 19:55:23 Bitcoin is just like stocks and shares. Goes up and down. The reason you heard about it is because around December it went to 20k but now it’s flown back down to like 10k
2597 2018-02-17 19:55:22 Agreed! Have to be careful out there. I generally stay clear of any venture listed companies but have some exposure to small cap #lithium stocks.
2598 2018-02-17 19:53:15 Questionable lol I have to thank you for public awareness. Wait till the world knows it’s no longer questionable but rather a fact :p 

What do you think will happen to these little penny stocks? #Patience #PDXP #HoldingThroughTheStorm
2599 2018-02-17 19:52:24 There's plenty of validity there, but at the same time, it's pretty hard to take stocks sub-50% without rage.
Rage existing kind of tilts things in favor of jank-heavy characters like Rosa, ZSS, and of course, Bayonetta.
It also is a variable that makes percent-based combos hard.
2600 2018-02-17 19:52:20 Well said John! It’s disgusting what HFs and MMs do to tons of OTC stocks through NS and manipulation @DAMSConsulting
2601 2018-02-17 19:51:02 You get through it! I am determined to PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. The #GOP wouldn't even ban BUMP STOCKS! 

They blew it! I am calling it what it is! Condoning MURDER FOR PROFIT!
2602 2018-02-17 19:51:00 Bump stocks are no more effective at increasing the rate of fire than a finger. They were a novelty known only within the shooting community until Vegas. The ATF assessed them and found they DID NOT meet the prohibition to making guns fully automatic. Semi-auto is semi-auto.
2603 2018-02-17 19:50:53 I could live without the bump stocks.  They are pointless just like automatic weapons.  Magazine size and style do not matter.  They all do the same thing.  Reloading and premeditated loading aren't a factor when someone shows up prepared.
2604 2018-02-17 19:50:50 It's already against the law to go on a shooting spree in a school, there are serious penalties for that. Bump stocks would have been banned if not for over reach on the bill to ban them. Even the NRA was initially on board with it.
2605 2018-02-17 19:50:48 I LOVE this young woman & her friends, family & supporters. We need this outpouring of anger and disgust for what the NRA, gun manufacturers & the @GOP have done to our country by allowing purchases of semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, no background checks, CCW, etc. etc. etc.
2606 2018-02-17 19:49:58 Sir

2609 2018-02-17 19:48:57 I hate to say this but I agree that no one should own an AR 15 also no bump stocks and any kind of collapsible buttstock. Long rifles are hard to conceal.
2610 2018-02-17 19:48:54 ever doubled via stocks ?
2611 2018-02-17 19:48:24 The whales got wacked by correlation risk. There used to be a time when tf,s didn't trade stocks. Scalibility and chasing mngt fees comes at a price i guess
2612 2018-02-17 19:48:08 No but there is not ban on bump stocks that can dramatically increase the fire rate of semi automatic rifles almost to a level comparable to fully auto. So Stop being a twat and go away.
2613 2018-02-17 19:46:56 The mentally ill are in Congress. No one in their right mind believes that Americans access to assault weapons has nothing to do with these mass murders. They did NOTHING about the bump stocks that turn assault rifles into machine guns. @SpeakerRyan @pryan @SenateMajLdr
2614 2018-02-17 19:46:54 Over hyped and failed NYE launch.  Cult stocks with noob HODLers are a turn off for me
2615 2018-02-17 19:45:57 Agreed. SC could approve bans of: 1) any rifle using a magazine 2) any handgun magazine over 6 rounds 3) silencers 4) bump stocks 5) sniper scopes 6) any gun without a trigger lock
2616 2018-02-17 19:45:55 Tokens are simply digital shares. Crypto stocks.
2617 2018-02-17 19:45:33 as long as i can diversify wcw stocks.
2618 2018-02-17 19:45:27 Bump stocks and other devices essentially turn a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon. And a number of legal “semiautomatic” weapons very much toe the line between semi and full automatic

2622 2018-02-17 19:42:43 Which of these 2 kind of stocks would you suggest?
2623 2018-02-17 19:42:42 It's a start. Next steps: Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Ban guns.
2624 2018-02-17 19:42:40 Here is an idea, make bump stocks illegal.  OH WAIT THEY WERE, until OBAMA made  them legal, then in late 2016 he made it easier for mentally ill to get guns. QUICK FACT 4% OF ALL MASS SHOOTING ARE DONE BY MENTALLY ILL! You need a new talking point I killed this argument of yours
2625 2018-02-17 19:41:37 Limit mag size. No bump stocks. Extensive background checks. Serious penalties for violations of said laws. That kinda stuff. 
2626 2018-02-17 19:41:00 Yeah with guns that need to be better regulated. We need stronger penalties for breaking laws and some kind of license that needs updated every year with a behavior check. No more drum mags, 30 round mags, bump stocks,  silencers. Before the next mass shooting happens.
2627 2018-02-17 19:40:55 You can still own guns. I'm only in favor of banning assault styled rifles, bump stocks and large capacity magazines. Maybe limits on stockpiling ammunition too. Definitely much more aggressive background checks.
2628 2018-02-17 19:40:45 We need more laws than just this one. Ban automatic weapons, the amount of ammunition you can purchase , bump stocks and universal background checks.
2629 2018-02-17 19:40:36 @songs190 @coasterp dude I got in on riot @7 out at 34$. In on gbtc @ 940 out at 2995$. Not likely bro. Those were spec stocks. This is not
2630 2018-02-17 19:40:26 I really like this suggestion! Tax and regulate the number of bullets people can have at one time, ban assault riffles like AR-15's, ban bump stocks and large clips and put in metal detectors at schools! This on top of your suggestion...
2631 2018-02-17 19:39:49 True. Abhi tak I was investing short term. 2-3 months and sell. Ab thinking of selecting 8-9 stocks and investing for a year.
2632 2018-02-17 19:39:11 No. No. And No. ——> 1. Get the $ out of politics completely 2.  Ban all assault rifles, bump stocks permanently 3. Recall every AR & bump stock sold 4. Bring a suit against the government, gun manufacturers, gun salesmen, and the NRA for not protecting our children and educators
2633 2018-02-17 19:37:59 1/
Ban bump stocks and semi auto rifles immediately.
Ban banana clips. More police funding.
Universal background check
Voluntary buybacks
No registries. Protect privacy.
2634 2018-02-17 19:37:45 One thought here, the premise of the NRA is not bad, I get it 2nd Amendment.Why I disagree with their policies is that they never take the country 'as a whole' into account with the wisdom of their forward looking. They never put the brakes on a say whoa bump stocks
too much..or

2636 2018-02-17 19:36:53 Yes! Thats true. But these are the times you realize how fundamentally good your stocks are.
2637 2018-02-17 19:36:25 Good :) we have to start with the common nugget. How do you feel about huge mags and assault rifles and bump stocks?
2638 2018-02-17 19:36:21 Stocks up when more guns sold?
2639 2018-02-17 19:36:03 I think you may have missed the point of what Dalio said. He said we’re entering the part of the cycle in which people start feeling dumb for holding cash - not that HE would feel dumb for holding cash. See the articles about Bridgewater’s $22bln Euro stocks short position...
2640 2018-02-17 19:35:30 That’s where we need to start. The accessories of the “black gun”. The high capacity mag, which is banned from hunting in most states, the trigger conversion kit, which is “illegal installed”, bump stocks, extreme vetting, reinstate BO’s mental illness ban, up age of purchase.
2641 2018-02-17 19:34:33 I've done the same after buying the crappy stuff - took me ages to work out the brands that had no emulsifiers. Luckily the shop 2 mins from my house stocks one of them. #smallmercies 
2642 2018-02-17 19:34:00 IDF needs to empty its arsenal so Pentagon can replenish their stocks using hard earned American tax payer dollars.
2643 2018-02-17 19:33:26 That depends on which ones you do. Me? I never have thought devices like bump stocks should have ever been legal. You want to pretend to have a full auto, go through the process to get one. But an AR 15? No. A clip that holds more than a standard clip? No.
2644 2018-02-17 19:33:05 Switzerland absolutely does not issue guns to households. That's utter made up bullshit. There's public stocks of guns, but they are not issues to households!

2647 2018-02-17 19:31:31 Yeah. I am moving my money out of banking stocks.
2648 2018-02-17 19:30:18 Even if those who have been perpetually predicting a stock price decline act as though they predicted last week's sudden sharp fall in US and Japanese stocks, that only means that they also failed to predict the preceding bull market driven by Trump and Abenomics.

2652 2018-02-17 19:29:47 That's just plum crazy I would have thought that it would have passed almost unanimously. I'm a Ultra Conservative Republican but bump  serve no good purpose. I've shot one and they usually just end up jamming anyway. I hope someday that bump stocks are highly regulated or banned
2653 2018-02-17 19:29:44 He tried to munipulate it by having his rich 1 percents help buy stocks in the market to kick start.
2654 2018-02-17 19:29:17 Give it a freaking day!They worked  on the bump stocks and I’m sure this will bring change.Sure, making all guns illegal(not that will stop this)is nice in a fantasy world. Think about all the damage the bombs will do. That’s turning 17 casualties into the whole school, possibly!
2655 2018-02-17 19:27:47 Ohh. You were talking about your stocks being up? Damn.

Yes I do.
2656 2018-02-17 19:27:09 Stocks and bonds.
2657 2018-02-17 19:26:38 The only bias is on fox news. The republican party take millions of $$$$ from the NRA.  Our children are dying. All anyone is asking is to enact some sensible gun regulations like 7 day waiting period, no bump stocks, no silencers.  Things we should all be able to get behind.
2658 2018-02-17 19:26:01 you actively invest in stocks?
2659 2018-02-17 19:24:47 I'd like to see techniques rather than recipes. The right way to make sauces, how to braise, knife skills, stocks, roux, etc.
2660 2018-02-17 19:24:36 Too bad store 4045 NEVER stocks their shelves and they’re so rude. See my tweet from earlier
2661 2018-02-17 19:23:49 Stop saying there's nothing we can do! We can ban bump stocks & high capacity magazines on a Federal level. We can require people to pass a background check/register to purchase bullets. We can remove already purchased firearms from people with ANY violent infractions.
2662 2018-02-17 19:23:23 Exactly wrong. Civilians owning a gun is a 2ndA right but doesn't mean a right to own countless military style assault rifles,30+round ammo,bump stocks,silencers & an entire arsenal. I've seen firsthand the NRA lobby/bribe Congress just to sell more guns & screw the consequences.
2663 2018-02-17 19:23:14 Yes, stronger than the hate and destruction you preach. Mental health checks, ban assault rifles, bump stocks, gun show loopholes and stockpiling. Do something to show you care about anyone but yourself. #Unfit #ENOUGH #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
2664 2018-02-17 19:23:07 I know few who are pushing to do a total take down. Most want to close gun show loopholes, look into if the background checks are doing as much as they can, banning bump stocks, and wanting a look into the rifle used in most of these mass shootings.
2665 2018-02-17 19:22:13 Riot weakness was due to hit piece by CNBC ... most of the BTC stocks weakness was sympathy selling off that report. Not sure about RIOT reaction Tuesday, but other BTC correlated plays likely up nicely.
2666 2018-02-17 19:22:04 out of ammo. NOW HERE is what I WANT to know and what people should be bitching about. WHY does a civilian gun need to be able to hold/shot 30 rounds before needing to be reloaded... it doesn't. Issue number 2 why are bump stocks (Vegas Shooter) and other things like the BS
2667 2018-02-17 19:21:52 割とずっと活動し続けてるのにやること終わらないしおかしいなぁ
2668 2018-02-17 19:21:50 Me too Greenman. A lot of bearish writing out there right now on weed stocks.  Truth is many have already pulled back and the Feds timeline is now a known entity. Equity markets are recovering. Its a sector i want to be in right now and for next few quarters.
2669 2018-02-17 19:21:13 Civilians owning a gun is a 2ndA right but that doesn't mean a right to own countless military style assault rifles,30+round ammo, bump stocks, silencers & an entire arsenal.

2670 2018-02-17 19:21:06 Energy-efficient design  Some of these funds buy stocks but also engage in shorting, or selling a borrowed stock in hopes that its pri ce will fall, allowing it to be purchased later at a lower price. #MaiVerde #monotaskingmeasureless

2672 2018-02-17 19:20:51 You're pretty good with analyzing stocks so just take a minute to compare other countries gun laws to the stats. Just research. I mean, the kid bought an AR15 legally. It wasn't from the help of a cartel.
2673 2018-02-17 19:20:27 @OrrinHatch There is no enumerated right for AR 15’s or glocks, bump stocks or automatic weapons in the constitution. Shameful.
2674 2018-02-17 19:20:20 Why are bump stocks legal?
2675 2018-02-17 19:20:17 Anyone into day trading stocks?
2676 2018-02-17 19:20:08 I agree with this. But congress hasn't even tried to do anything to solve the problem. They couldn't even ban bump stocks after the Vegas shooting for fuck sake. No common citizen needs bump stocks. And neither does any one of them need an AR-15. So that's a good place to start.
2677 2018-02-17 19:20:04 Thank you Chris Cole @ArtemisVol for all of your knowledge and insights on volatility.

2680 2018-02-17 19:18:57 Shouldn't you be making another dumb tweet about your #Disney stocks? I haven't seen one this round so far and I'm worried what it indicates about your wellbeing. Please tell me you still believe the worth of #StarWars depends on how much money it makes you?
2681 2018-02-17 19:18:52 Blue chip is to do with stocks. You guys are clueless
2682 2018-02-17 19:18:31 #equitylove still the best choice to make good capital if you can pick best stocks at these lower levels.
2683 2018-02-17 19:18:17 It’s ironic that the photo u posted was about a single shot musket. I’m ok with a musket because it’s single shot. I have problems with a 20shot magazine that empties in 20seconds or bump stocks. Modern problems call for modern solutions.
2684 2018-02-17 19:18:10 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan you take millions of $$$$ from the NRA & cut funding for those in need.  Our children are dying.  Do something. Enact sensible gun regulations like 7 day waiting period, no bump stocks, no silencers.  There are regulations we can all get behind.
2685 2018-02-17 19:18:04 This is idiotic as usual. The President has no control over the stock market. If so, Obama was better than Trump for stocks! Do some homework or can’t you read.
2686 2018-02-17 19:18:03 Same here. Idiocy to keep a gun in the classroom. I teach eighth grade boys. English grammar boot camp is hard enough. Ban assault rifles. Ban bump stocks. Ban guns.
2687 2018-02-17 19:17:51 Some of my favourite stocks 
2688 2018-02-17 19:17:05 I own stocks in Walmart, which would signify some ownership and equity in the company. I can say “MY”.  Anything else?

2690 2018-02-17 19:16:31 India has 2 separate exchange of SME stocks only. BSESME & NSE EMERGE.But people are extremely warY of investing in these nanocaps due to high risks T. How to filter quality cos amongst them? what wud be your filtering criteria?
2691 2018-02-17 19:14:28 3) ban assault rifles like the 1994 ban that expired in 2004 and had a grandfather clause (no guns taken). 4) ban high capacity magazines over 10 rounds (no guns taken) 5) ban bump stocks (no guns taken). Do you see the pattern here? Hint: it's "no guns taken".
2692 2018-02-17 19:14:13 they have made changes, but their way of changing stuff is stupid because of the narrative they run with. Bump stocks do nothing with lethality, any competent shooter will be more deadly without one

2694 2018-02-17 19:13:29 I think it was because you were a stock trader posting about stocks before the desperate ‘arm all Americans with more guns’ posts.  Enjoy your day at the shooting range. Celebrate guns.

2697 2018-02-17 19:12:52 I hope that is true and you will go back to DC and enact some sensible gun laws like 7 day background check, NO bump stocks, NO silencers ~ things all Americans can agree on.  Be the leader we need

2700 2018-02-17 19:11:20 Who stocks a corn cob up your a*******
2701 2018-02-17 19:10:34 I don't trust this stocks up and down either. Those always taking the lead will take the last uncoverings by Mueller's team as an excuse to drive it down again. It's overdue anyway. Where are the sellers gone ?
2702 2018-02-17 19:09:51 as we were walking into whole foods this morning, our 5-year-old read a sign and said, "amazon bought whole foods?!? wow. can you believe it? that is really important." at which point it wouldn't have surprised me if she had pulled out her phone to check the value of her stocks.
2703 2018-02-17 19:09:51 I guess it's still too early about talking about bump stocks from the Vegas guy?
2704 2018-02-17 19:09:17 There is a simple solution to stop mass murder. Ban the tools people use to commit mass murder. Ban assault weapons, they are designed to produce mass casualties. Ban bump-stocks - they let gunmen shoot faster. Ban high capacity magazines, make a shooter reload. Save a kid.
2705 2018-02-17 19:08:48 Please explain to me the last Vegas shooter then. When are the Republicans going to prove they are not nuts and ban bump stocks.
2706 2018-02-17 19:05:40 FINALLY, PROPER BANTER! So right now is a decently solid time to own stocks in Chipotle, as of yesterday it had a roughly 7% increase in price, woo boy
2707 2018-02-17 19:05:37 Dude congress can't even outlaw bump stocks. This dude runs a podcast. You fear mongering bad dad. PAY YOUR CHILD SUPPORT.
2708 2018-02-17 19:05:32 Football fans get to celebrate.  Gun fans cant celebrate out in the open. You know in private , they are like "yeah guns", right now. Probably fist bumping and chest bumping. Or bumping stocks. I dont know what the hell you gun people do. Im afraid to know.
2709 2018-02-17 19:05:09 It's also way too easy to make it automatic (though I guess bump stocks are banned as well now?)
2710 2018-02-17 19:05:01 NRA is in favor of banning bump stocks too. But you won't hear that from the narrative-loving msm.
2711 2018-02-17 19:03:56 Yeah i know! Sad that his stocks fell so badly! Personally, i absolutely love him!
2712 2018-02-17 19:03:31 To our members of Congress. No half measures. Ban the sale of assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
2713 2018-02-17 19:02:48 Iconic moments
2714 2018-02-17 19:02:41 Get all the POC to buy AR-15s and bump stocks
-->instant gun control laws
2715 2018-02-17 19:02:30 In 2001, my dad gifted me with my 1st invest accnt. He got me random stocks $6-$25 from 100-1000 shares per Co. Many failed. About half remained inc struggling like $f & successful like $amzn. Overall my account doubled many times over. Holding works if spread over many sectors.
2716 2018-02-17 19:02:01 why are we this way  tbbbb
2717 2018-02-17 18:59:57 Yup. #TeamSaintGG wrist band free* with every purchase. *whilst stocks last
2718 2018-02-17 18:59:40 Whenever we find a store that stocks Peach and/or Black Cherry, we stockpile as much as we can.
2719 2018-02-17 18:57:56 2.This is why the High-Cap magazines and Bump-Stocks need to be banned.  I am from a family of gun owners and enthusiasts, but there needs to be better legislation on gun sales, licensing, training and ability to track from manufacturing to sales to ownership. Simple Common sense
2720 2018-02-17 18:57:30 Schumer, the 'stocks' has no effect on my life whatsoever, but let me tell you about the $1000.00 bonus my son just got from his company, and about the super huge tax refund he also just received, and how he just was able to go out and purchase health ins. at an AFFORDABLE rate.
2721 2018-02-17 18:57:02 Y’all are foolish acting acting because you made some money off an illegal pyramid scheme quit ripping kids off, get a job and go learn about stocks and bonds.
2722 2018-02-17 18:56:46 He purchased over 30 rifles legally over one year. Rifles are not required to be reported. His bump stocks were also purchased and attached legally. Therefore, we definitely have a legal problem here.
2723 2018-02-17 18:56:15 Far as I'm aware, only real difference is full auto fire capabilty. And gun shops can sell modified stocks that basicly give full auto.

2725 2018-02-17 18:54:10 They care about gutting society into a 3rd World shithole. They need to be in stocks in the town square.
2726 2018-02-17 18:53:37 The buck stops with trump, as u stated HE signed off on it. With republicans in control of all branches of gov and absolutely nothing was even done with bump stocks.....
2727 2018-02-17 18:51:57 Didn’t reply to the reply though
2728 2018-02-17 18:51:46 Have we banned bump stocks and high capacity magazines yet!
2729 2018-02-17 18:51:46 Stack Royalties Is the first to offer mineral procuring land for sale to the public. Why invest in wells or oil stocks when you could own the land and its minerals!
2730 2018-02-17 18:51:19 Can't wait for people to start investing in stocks of compassion, justice, moral integrity.
2731 2018-02-17 18:50:55 Lol I hope not, the news wasn’t that bad. You can’t let people influence your trades, $fat is still a good company with solid fundamentals and a plan in motion. They took a beating along with the rest of the lithium stocks, but they have major catalysts coming very soon.
2732 2018-02-17 18:50:53 The advice given was flawed imho, equating risk on AIM stocks such as Fever Tree (valuation risk) with Globo (obvious fraud) is mendacious at best, most people could see the red flags at Globo even if the IC couldn’t , I don’t & have never held either stock fwiw
2733 2018-02-17 18:50:48 We CAN'T Fix all the Ill, Angry, Vengeful Folks in America. With ONE VOTE, we can return Semi-Automatics & Bump Stocks to the EXISTING Weapons Ban List.
2734 2018-02-17 18:50:07 And banning bump stocks and semi automatics. THIS is NOT The time to minimize the regulations that will keep our kids alive IS NOT NOW. Real reform NOW. THIS IS ON GOP. They have been in bed way too long with the heads of NRA. And no I’m not talking about the regular members!
2735 2018-02-17 18:49:52 Gun regulations I've thought of that we could do on a basic level.
Can't buy a gun if you are: 
Violent offenders
people on the no fly list
people under 21
mentally ill
have a history of abuse
Outlaw the sale of:
Bump stocks
Automatics
Semi automatics
Military grade hardware

2739 2018-02-17 18:47:22 This is the most ridiculous, gutless and flat out dumb proposal I have ever heard of. Feinstein needs to resign. And photo is from her attempt to ban bump stocks.
2740 2018-02-17 18:47:18 Can we please just ban AR style Guns. Or at the minimum bump stocks. Please.

2742 2018-02-17 18:46:31 @anmol_ambani  I want to talk to you. It is a very high time that some actions should be taken to revive the Reliance group. I am saying to you because my father is emotionally attached to the group and is bearing huge losses in all of the group stocks.

2745 2018-02-17 18:45:09 You could have had bumper stocks banned but the pro gun control Democrats would not go along without high capacity magazine and suppressors.

2747 2018-02-17 18:42:36 I need someone to teach me how to invest in stocks
2748 2018-02-17 18:42:06 I don't own a gun, I've never touched a gun. Assault Rifles and bump stocks and Gun clips must be banned .
2749 2018-02-17 18:41:31 I'm so jealous. It's a 60 minute drive to Boston, which has one pie shop, and it's a tiny hipster place that stocks out.

And did I mention I'm a Sunderland supporter?
2750 2018-02-17 18:41:12 Nice of @Virgin_TrainsEC to be as prompt as @VirginTrains with their reply. Oh wait.........
2751 2018-02-17 18:40:50 Thoughts and prayers don’t seem to be getting it done!  We don’t need military style weapons for hunting and self defense in our homes, nor do we need bump stocks and high capacity magazine.  These are not defense weapons they are for assault.  Stop this madness NOW!
2752 2018-02-17 18:40:36 The scam was well covered because the LoUs were being renewed periodically and the borrower was showing stocks and assets. Only when the new Dy Manager refuses to renew the LoUs and raised an alarm the company collapsed like a pack of cards.

2755 2018-02-17 18:37:59 Then. Once the license has been accepted by the gun culture you can begin to tighten controls on things that the public doesnt need.

start with silencers and bump stocks. Get caught and lose your privelages / get punished.
2756 2018-02-17 18:35:22 Pick:

No bump stocks / cranks

Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban.             Annual psych eval
2757 2018-02-17 18:34:40 I don't see anything about how they legalized sales of bump stocks and silencers, as well as ability for carriers to cross state lines.
2758 2018-02-17 18:34:23 Bump stocks should be made illegal. I also like the idea of moving to “smart guns”
2759 2018-02-17 18:34:12 But yes, im for stricter protections but if you pass all the tests you should be able to have as many rifles as you want, and you as many bump stocks aslong as you lock em up
2760 2018-02-17 18:32:54 But, and ive given this a lot of thought through the years, how do we change a culture where guns are so ingrained? 

Why do stocks for gun manufacturers go up every time theres a mass shooting? Because the gun nuts think this is the time that they'll do a 'gun grab'
2761 2018-02-17 18:32:04 45 minute application, 30 minute phone interview, and an in home inspection to ADOPT A DOG!! Certainly they should make gun laws tighter. I'd like a total ban on semi automatic, automatic and bump stocks. Kids are more important!
2762 2018-02-17 18:31:56 I can and do short OTC stocks, mostly during the summer tho (& I love it). Interactive Brokers let's you short anything you want including OTC sub $1. I can only afford to short stocks .20c and up though b/c of margin reqs. Higher the price, cheaper/easier to short.
2763 2018-02-17 18:31:20 Assets to invest in

Stocks/bonds/mutual funds
Life Insurance (aka buying money when you have PURE insurance)

2766 2018-02-17 18:29:57 Liberals don’t want to literally take all guns away. They want common sense gun laws. No extended mags, no assault rifles, no bump stocks that essentially turn your semi auto gun into full auto. We want background checks. Let’s not just sell anybody a damn gun. Common sense stuff
2767 2018-02-17 18:24:40 CoS is saying responsible people should have a path to a firearm.
I agree, but am curious if CoS would be against laws preventing sale of military hardware like an AR.
What is CoS opinion on bump stocks?
2768 2018-02-17 18:22:30 Are you Cutting ties with the Big Bucks from the NRA?? Let's talk about STRONG GUN CONTROL, STRONG VETTING in All States Keep track of ALL Gun Owners & their Purchases of Weapons & Ammo, Bump Stocks! Someone can create a Program to DO THIS! Start Making Our Nation Safer trump!!
2769 2018-02-17 18:21:37 Help Kids and the innocent by PASSING SENSIBLE GUN LAWS-No Assault weapons, no bump stocks, no high capacity magazines-GIVE TAX CREDIT to turn in these weapons!!!

2771 2018-02-17 18:21:24 1) reinstate the ban on assault rifle sales
2) pass legislation that prevents gun purchase by those with a history of mental illness or domestic abuse
3) ban bump stocks
4) close the “gun show loophole”
Sensible, feasible. We can do this.

2774 2018-02-17 18:19:40 the skew between my mistakes vs simply picking a bad stock is probably 75% my mistakes and 25% picking bad stocks.  You could say that I'm the biggest problem in my system and wouldn't be wrong #truestatement
2775 2018-02-17 18:19:03 Yes, but if you assemble a set of dividend paying stocks that routinely grow dividends, inflation protection is achieved.  And qualified dividends are favorably taxed.
2776 2018-02-17 18:18:05 “Born-again virgin” ...sorry that isn’t a theologically or scripturally sound idea. Let’s not become laughing stocks to non-believers. Just say “forgiven.”

2778 2018-02-17 18:16:04 Yep. I'd prefer to see these type of enhancements as well as easy bans on bump stocks and clips that can hold more than 10 bullets. I also think if you ban semi-automatic guns on individual sales, you could appease w/ special licenses for clubs/ranges to offer shooting services.
2779 2018-02-17 18:15:56 Bann assault weapons, bump stocks and huge ammo clips. Psychological evaluation for purchasing guns.Thats what they do in the UK and their deaths from firearms are a tiny fraction of ours.

2780 2018-02-17 18:14:34 Coming: If it passes the house, a ban on bump-stocks.
2781 2018-02-17 18:13:37 Summarizes my time learning how to trade stocks. Another good one quote here.
2782 2018-02-17 18:13:33 I’m a gun owner & hunter. No one with a mental illness needs a gun. Those who don’t get that should be checked for mental illness. The right to bear arms doesn’t prevent the government from limiting access to accessories, including bump stocks & magazines with excessive volume.
2783 2018-02-17 18:11:38 Me too, I'm a Democrat, gun owner, support the second amendment, I don't support the sale of Assault Weapons, bump stocks etc.  Can't remember mass shooting done with a hunting rifle holding five rounds of ammo.

2786 2018-02-17 18:10:44 listening to financial experts they never say the UK is a good place to invest in stocks wise
2787 2018-02-17 18:09:57 This  always deflects gun control issues. Its abt $$$ so  pensions should dump their stocks and tech billionaires should short the f**k out the gun stocks
2788 2018-02-17 18:09:33 It is the one thing that mostly turns me off about Fox news they promote fear they constantly tell people that if we take bump stocks away the whole constitution is going to go away. They are mongering is never OK.
2789 2018-02-17 18:09:27 You're free to believe that if you wish but you're mistaken. Many legal gun restrictions already exist and many more can be added without any need of amending the Constitution. Bump stocks, magazine capacity and assault weapons ban can and should be added to existing laws IMO.

2791 2018-02-17 18:09:11 Action Plan:
1) Enhanced universal background checks when buying a gun
2) Ban on bump stocks
3) Ban on assault style weapons 

Result: 2nd amendment rights are still in place. People are safer. Please RT. #GunControlNow
2792 2018-02-17 18:08:26 He's the stupid one right? He thinks I have more money because the stock market is up. How do I buy one of them there stocks like he has. Incorrect grammar intended.
2793 2018-02-17 18:08:18 Getting tickets to Black Panther is like buy stocks - hesitate and you'll miss out!

I can't recall the last time it was like this for a movie in Knoxville =)
2794 2018-02-17 18:08:03 Limited how? Virtually all guns are semiautomatic other than shotguns and revolvers. Bump stocks will be put on the ATF to regulate, which I'm fine with. People have shown interest in background checks for private sales. Not sure how that would work, unless they had access
2795 2018-02-17 18:05:48 It's a false distinction. No one needs high-velocity, high-capacity rifles capable of semi-automatic or automatic fire (bump stocks). These are weapons of slaughter & someone's hobby shooting them isn't worth these massacres.
2796 2018-02-17 18:05:07 I would not attempt to try to totally convince you of anything. Bump stocks and AR15s don't kill people; people do. Pressure cookers, cars, trucks, knives, or anything pointed and AR15s are all owned by responsible people. No, I expect nothing to convince you.
2797 2018-02-17 18:04:27 You dont follow stocks do you or understand ratio.

2800 2018-02-17 18:02:53 Stocks to watch this week : DPZ, HD, WMT, VVC, Jack, WEN. Garunteed to move by 10-20%.

2801 2018-02-17 18:02:16 That's part of the solution, yes. But we need better gun laws. 4 armed officers aren't going to stop an assailant with an AR, smoke grenades, bump stocks and body armor.
2802 2018-02-17 18:01:32 とじのみこ7話まで見終わりました
明日のイベントは安心です
2803 2018-02-17 18:00:26 UHGGGG BEEN ON THE ROAD SINCE 3:30 Etc #lasucks #LAIDIOTS WITH TOO MUCH  $.    I HEAR Stocks taking a dip finnally!
2804 2018-02-17 17:59:53 That is not enough. Introduce a bill to ban all assault weapons and bump stocks!
2805 2018-02-17 17:59:40 Why is @CanopyGrowth stocks halted?? #canopy #weed #weedstocks
2806 2018-02-17 17:59:23 13%  Of The increased wealth for big business is being returned in the bonuses, and wage increases for their workers. The big winners are the corporations, 43%. Buying back their own stocks, making them ever wealthier. But that doesn’t mean they’ll reinvest in more hiring
2807 2018-02-17 17:59:17 I don’t think we will ever agree on this. I respect your right to have a gun for self defense. I will never respect the right of a mentally ill teenager to buy an AR-15, or for someone to stockpile military weapons with bump-stocks and armor-piercing bullets.
2808 2018-02-17 17:57:07 You are going to burn for what you’ve done to this country. Btw My representative @RepDavid Schweikert supports every @NRA policy that comes to a vote. HE SUPPORTS: NATIONAL CONCEAL & CARRY, SILENCERS, BUMP STOCKS, SALE TO MENTALLY ILL & KNOWN DOMESTIC ABUSERS. #CriminalMinds
2809 2018-02-17 17:56:28 90-99% of people oppose bump stocks
A b.stock was used in the worse mass shooting ever
The B.stock is primarily responsible 4the high #of deaths in the massacre 
Yet because the NRA opposes making them illegal
Congress has kept them legal 6 months out from the Las Vegas massacre
2810 2018-02-17 17:56:27 Same as before. Long rifles limited. No semi-automatic or bump stocks, both of which make guns very inaccurate, one more quickly than the other. No extended clips beyond what the guns come with, like 9 or 15 bullets. Background checks universal and no exceptions.
2811 2018-02-17 17:55:40 We have sets of fans who believe It's alright to slag the fans who give abuse criticism to Bellerin yet they believe It was ok for them to abuse criticise Alexis Sanchez before he left us that is why we are the biggest laughing stocks in world football that's it!
2812 2018-02-17 17:55:19 I need to invest in stocks ...champion , fossil , Microsoft ,
2813 2018-02-17 17:55:11 Ban high capacity magazines, raise the legal age on the federal level, require gun safety training and insurance and BAN bumper stocks. It took 3 minutes to slaughter these kids and the adults. Civilians should not have access to AR15s, they serve no legitimate purpose.
2814 2018-02-17 17:53:36 A few stocks removed from the weekly ACJ watchlist: $RHT $ADBE $TAL $ATHM and a few added: $AMAT $BZUN $ROKU $TEAM $ANET $CORT $TTWO
2815 2018-02-17 17:53:19 It's more the asset allocation mix.  Risk parity strats have a larger nominal FI position than equity (so portfolio risks are even). So stocks up a bit on the year and bonds down a lot = risk parity down.  Bonds also bounced less than stox, hence underperf vs 60/40 last week
2816 2018-02-17 17:52:37 Top 10 stocks making New 52 Week Lows: $NNDM $JRJR $AMDA $AVGR $DTRM $PI $PDFS $REXX $IPCI $UPL #Stocks #Investing #Bitcoin #Cryptocurrency
2817 2018-02-17 17:51:41 There we go! Let's start as absolutely small as possible! Hopefully this doesn't suffer the same fate as the last time Congress tried to do the LEAST they could possibly do with bump stocks following Vegas.
2818 2018-02-17 17:51:32 Stocks go up.  Stocks go down.  SAM massacred both sides and I mean massacred wow then out of the blue SAM buys cmg 292.5 at 1.2.  Room saysung omg why sam buying cmg.  Lol.  Boom boom
2819 2018-02-17 17:51:05 Bump Stocks are still legal 
Why because the NRA opposes making them illegal and no congressmen wants their A+ NRA rating to go down at all.
Congressman love towting NRA ratings to constituents. It’s easy signaling as a conservative.
2820 2018-02-17 17:49:54 No problem with 2nd A, but only as it was intended, as a self-defense "well regulated militia". The obvious key words are "WELL-REGULATED"! Not "buy what you want, when you want, no questions asked"! There is no need for civilian AR-15s, high-capacity magazines, or "bump stocks"!
2821 2018-02-17 17:49:32 I think it is more relevant in traditional stocks but probably doesn't work in crypto.
2822 2018-02-17 17:49:19 Hopefully @GAMEdigital can help me out. I bought it online but hopefully my local store stocks it 
2823 2018-02-17 17:49:01 Actually bump stocks don’t fall into category’s be banned. Do you know you can still make a gun fire that way with or without a bump stock.
2824 2018-02-17 17:48:31 Market sentiments and fundamentals are far more important than price!

2825 2018-02-17 17:48:27 Feeling annoyed from another dream with Norman Reedus (Daryl from The Walking Dead). I got a long ass lecture about bull and bear markets and then a ranting lecture about why the stocks he was offered for a job sucked. Still feel the urge to throw things at his head. 
2826 2018-02-17 17:48:05 @davidhogg111 I called my representatives.  I specifically asked them to support bans on AR-15s & bump stocks. I told them that no citizens need these and that our children are dying.I’m wondering if you support these bans or other specific measures? Thanks for your leadership!
2827 2018-02-17 17:48:02 Over $4T in CB stimulus plus trillions more in debt for 2.5% GDP after 9yrs. Some say it's 1% GDP adjusted for the savings drop from 6% to 2.4% plus strip out consumer credit card purchases. Everything is broken yet inv bid stocks as the best bet believing the tax plan works.

2829 2018-02-17 17:46:35 Economics in America: if we all broke each other's legs, GDP would go up.  Whats wrong with this? Also, real wages go up finally, and stocks tank.  Whats wrong with this system?  No wonder America is cruel right now, our economics of profit over people have us killing each other.
2830 2018-02-17 17:46:34 @eatthinkprofit is your account still active? Do you still trade stocks?
2831 2018-02-17 17:46:21 Over $4T in CB stimulus plus trillions more in debt for 2.5% GDP after 9yrs.

2832 2018-02-17 17:46:12 Of course criminals are not going to follow laws--so let's get rid of things like bump stocks and AR-15s and force the criminals to figure out to use knives or baseball bats, or at least make it WAY HARDER to get their hands on guns. Lower death toll all around.
2833 2018-02-17 17:45:19 Knee-Jerk?  
Speaker Ryan, Man, cares more about our children than guns!  Monday Law Now-no bump stocks and no gift guns for ppl under 21 yrs of age like a drink. Not complicated  like other new or changed laws.
Save 1 note or 100 more children?  A, Monday Law.
2834 2018-02-17 17:44:10 Markets will fall for a few more days, will get ample opportunities to get the stocks at attractive prices. But only quality companies should be sought. One can even average their bets over time.
2835 2018-02-17 17:44:07 Don't worry uncle~ i will take care of both of them really well. They will be happy as long as their tuna stocks is there ㅋㅋ
2836 2018-02-17 17:44:05 @SenTedCruz you’re a fool and an NRA puppet. Ban semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. You & your other NRA puppets will be voted out! We’ll vote in good people who won’t take bribes in the form of donations from the NRA.
2837 2018-02-17 17:41:23 On the probably futile hope you actually are looking for a reasonable solution, I don't propose banning all guns. I propose stricter gun regulations. 1) ban semi automatic rifles, bump stocks, silencers.
2838 2018-02-17 17:40:39 That is the sale value seized in the stores, this includes their profit.Jewellery store keeps the value of their stocks updated .The value cannot be so much of mark that it is valued at 100 crores, maybe 200 to 300 crores is the profit margin. In jewellery it is a lot .
2839 2018-02-17 17:40:13 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2840 2018-02-17 17:39:58 Bushmaster (maker of AR-15) stocks are up!!!
2841 2018-02-17 17:39:26 blood donation stocks are currently low so i just wanna urge everyone i know to go give blood - its so easy, you get free snacks and it literally saves peoples lives so please consider donating!!
2842 2018-02-17 17:37:58 No way this adds to leverage at the most benign time (in terms of interest rates, propensity for retail to buy stocks). What happens when the tide turns and you have increasingly leveraged firms facing reductions in EBITA? Couple this with corporate buybacks marking tops..
2843 2018-02-17 17:37:32 Like removing access to semi-automatic rifles, bump stocks... DO SOMETHING!
2844 2018-02-17 17:37:08 Well it did underperform expectations. Theater chains had stocks decline, Hasbro had stocks decline due to low toy sales, it’s definitely in decline and they’re probably in panic mode behind the scenes.
2845 2018-02-17 17:36:33 Rinse, repeat. There is no use for bump stocks other than mass murdering and skirting full-auto laws.
2846 2018-02-17 17:34:16 needa start reading up more on stocks 
2847 2018-02-17 17:34:07 You're right. It's very difficult and very expensive and you have to register it. That's why people buy semi-automatics and why some idiot made bump-stocks to turn them into automatics. AR 15's are weapons of war designed to produce mass casualties. We'll fix this.
2848 2018-02-17 17:33:39 ...and enough with the 2nd Amendment argument. Until you and your "well-regulated militia" stocks up on tanks, helicopters, and rocket launchers, you're screwed against the most overly funded military in the world. Your cute AR-15 isn't gonna do squat.
2849 2018-02-17 17:33:31 The Founding Fathers never contemplated nor intended assault weapons, automatic or semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, masses of ammo etc in the hands of private citizens, especially 18-year-olds.  They would be horrified.
2850 2018-02-17 17:33:26 Thank you! Wasteful spending to prop stocks and build giant American flags on the sides of munitions. Diplomacy is cheaper and more effective. And people don’t die!
2851 2018-02-17 17:33:25 So as a fanbase we are absolutely the biggest laughing stocks in world football where we go from here i don't really know we have fans who accept mediocrity performances season in season out we have fans who blame each other for our failures over the last decade! Toxic cancer!

2853 2018-02-17 17:33:22 Hello @IKEA_France.
Il faudrait faire des efforts sur la gestion de vos stocks. J'en ai un peu marre de gaspiller du temps et du carburant pour des produits affichés en stock, mais indisponibles en magasin. Quant aux frais de réservation et livraison, c'est de l'abus. #Plaisir
2854 2018-02-17 17:33:20 It will take money,to develop  a system for better reporting, investigating and vetting  of suspicious persons.  The USA has this money.    
No bump stocks, -and no gift guns for ppl under 21 yrs, is easy. Monday Law Now! Monday Law Now!
2855 2018-02-17 17:32:50 Sorry but hand guns have fifteen round clips and can do same thing. Ban bump stocks is fine. FBI doing there job. School security. Business security. Awareness of surroundings. Personal hand gun.
2856 2018-02-17 17:32:25 Quando tens fortes quedas a maior parte das pessoas nem consegue vender, vimos isso recentemente, imagina se conseguissem. Comportam-se como penny stocks mesmo que o suposto mercado seja enorme e liquido.
2857 2018-02-17 17:32:22 You mean, just like the impact on the Fraser River, Burrard Inlet, the Salish Sea, the salmon stocks, etc etc?
2858 2018-02-17 17:32:03 Bump stocks are not banned.  They should be. Look at the carnage in Vegas in that short amount of time.  It makes no sense to ban automatic weapons if they can be modified to mimic the same effect.
2859 2018-02-17 17:31:53 GOP voted for Grassley sponsored legislation to make it EASIER for mentally ill to own guns.A year ago!They voted for silencers ‘sportsman heritage & recreation enhancement act”,refused to rid us of assult-type rifles,bump-stocks,high capacity magazines,took 6 million from NRA.
2860 2018-02-17 17:31:11 condolences = hollow words Hope & prayer won't stop an AR-15 emptying a clip in 3 seconds. Are gun owners rights to an AR-15 > my right to safety? Bump stocks? Talk later? Talk NOW! Congress; we don't need another John Hinkley Jr. to pass gun laws to make humans safe. Please act!
2861 2018-02-17 17:31:05 Except owners of other stocks aren’t forced to buy $AAPL to close their positions
2862 2018-02-17 17:30:51 Yes”A well regulated militia”. Over two hundred yrs ago they didn’t have bump stocks or semi automatics. What is it that you fear.17 more children are dead and you R still standing against what might prevent the next mass murder of our children.Its time 4 all of us 2 B reasonable
2863 2018-02-17 17:30:44 しごはじアクキー可愛いなこれ
2864 2018-02-17 17:29:39 But were used in these mass shootings, go figure. 

Also, let's not forget bump stocks...
2865 2018-02-17 17:29:31 Say, all the proposed legislation passes. AR15s are taken and destroyed, everyone gets a background check, bump stocks are gone, and magazines are under 10 rounds. What is going to stop a unchallenged person with a Winchester 1894 doing the same thing?
2866 2018-02-17 17:28:28 Cheney held stock in Halliburton and KBR, they were in Panama.  He held those stocks WHILE VICE PRESIDENT and signing off on the invasion of Iraq.  Those records have been leaked now.  How come you haven't posted about that even ONCE if you care so much about our Democracy?
2867 2018-02-17 17:28:15 Cheney held stock in Halliburton and KBR, they were in Panama.  He held those stocks WHILE VICE PRESIDENT and signing off on the invasion of Iraq.  Those records have been leaked now.  How come you haven't posted about that even ONCE if you care so much about our Democracy?
2868 2018-02-17 17:28:02 Still missing big picture. Ban assault rifle sales & bump stocks, more extensive background checks, reinstate mental health reg revoked by GOP . If just 1 in 1,000,000 chance a single life could be saved, worth it! Value human life over campaign contributions & gun sales $!
2869 2018-02-17 17:27:32 With the exception of bump stocks, those are just dumb, and highly impractical. And magazines don’t really get ‘extended’ they are what they are made to be.
2870 2018-02-17 17:27:17 I agree this is part of the issue. We need regulations on guns. I never stated I wanted to get rid of all guns. I’ve been asking why we need AR15s this whole time. Or bump stocks? That doesn’t make sense
2871 2018-02-17 17:26:35 I might have found someone that will help me make sense of biopharma stocks. 

Look at God working.
2872 2018-02-17 17:26:05 For all those watching for the DEATH CROSS, 50 under the 200, we should be down by 30 percent, by the time it occurs.............Vast majority of stocks, under the 50 now....
2873 2018-02-17 17:25:39 Look no further than the bump stock conversation. Republicans said "Okay lets talk about bump stocks.." and then Democrats said "Great! Oh and also suppressors and magazines". That's what killed it.
2874 2018-02-17 17:25:25 So did my husband. He also used to be a Republican, back when they weren't NUTS! He proudly supports NEITHER anymore! He's still a gun owner, but he's for gun reform. Background checks, no bump stocks, no 30 round clips, regulate gun shows, no AR15's or AK47's, etc., Also,  NRA
2875 2018-02-17 17:24:01 There are these two doc kids who spam forward smash and multi-shines, and they happen to warm up Drephen, who spot-dodges ten times in a row, four-stocks them, and says, "Morning, boys, how's the Melee?".
2876 2018-02-17 17:23:29 I can do it with a belt easily but they will still get a ban on manufactured bump stocks

I was not saying it would be effective, just what they can realistically expect from all their screaming and hysterics about "scary" guns
2877 2018-02-17 17:22:54 Last year 1.5 million AR-15s were sold. We don't have 1.5 million Soldiers in our Army. I thought congress would ban bump stocks after Las Vegas, nothing. Prayers are great, but mass shootings keep happening. We don't need another Hinkley Jr., to get laws passed. #FloridaStrong
2878 2018-02-17 17:21:42 Nice demonstration but still will do nothing.  Eliminate military style weapons; require training certificates and licensing before purchase of any gun; eliminate assault accessories like high capacity mags, armor piercing ammo and bump stocks; competency laws. DO IT.
2879 2018-02-17 17:20:30 My representative @RepDavid Schweikert supports every @NRA policy that comes to a vote. HE SUPPORTS: NATIONAL CONCEAL & CARRY, SILENCERS, BUMP STOCKS, SALE TO MENTALLY ILL & KNOWN DOMESTIC ABUSERS. #CriminalMinds #NeverEverTrustaRepublican
2880 2018-02-17 17:20:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
2881 2018-02-17 17:19:17 Need a GPS chip in guns and in schools (perhaps robot surveillance) as a warning system, or, to disarm the weapon. Ban bump stocks and assault weapons. Doesn't seem too difficult.
2882 2018-02-17 17:19:08 #POLL : Do I tweet too much about #stocks and other #investments?
2883 2018-02-17 17:19:02 Sensible approach armed security at schools, metal detectors and 1 way in exit doors that can't be operated from outside only for keaving6 building. And banning of assault rifles and bump stocks. Simple solution don't wait on Government do it state by state.
2884 2018-02-17 17:18:47 Remember when they were going to ban bump stocks, then the country moved on in less than a week. Nothing matters anymore. We will have a new hashtag next week to stress about.
2885 2018-02-17 17:18:22 AK-47s, AR-15s, bump stocks & extended clips sure aren’t about “protecting me & my lil family” as #2A frauds falsely and constantly claim. #NRAbloodmoney

2887 2018-02-17 17:18:10 ARs have terrified Florida. You have done nothing. At least address Bump Stocks!
2888 2018-02-17 17:18:07 Ban Assault Rifles! Do your job! Ban Bump Stocks! DO YOUR JOB!!!
2889 2018-02-17 17:17:45 This is true, which is why the far left’s cry of “lets be like Australia” is completely unhelpful. It prevents any reasonable measures from being passed. We don’t need wholesale confiscation. Ban bump stocks, add common sense regulations. It isn’t hard.
2890 2018-02-17 17:14:50 Just got one of those CQR stocks two weeks ago. I like it.
2891 2018-02-17 17:13:49 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Ban magazines that carry over 30 rounds
3. Prohibit people on the terrorist watchlist from purchasing firearms
4. Require those wishing to purchase firearms to first obtain a permit

These proposals are not unreasonable, nor are they extreme.
#CommonSense
2892 2018-02-17 17:13:45 Bump stocks. These are not just 'for sale'. They can also be easily manufactured by individuals in the home. What is your solution for this?
2893 2018-02-17 17:13:23 I wouldn’t object to AR15 type rifles being banned. But as soon as you start talking about it, everyone will go out and buy them. Happened with bump stocks. Are gun ban advocates willing to confiscate these weapons from current owners? If not, law not effective. @SenFeinstein
2894 2018-02-17 17:13:10 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
2895 2018-02-17 17:13:10 HIGHBEAM UNITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2896 2018-02-17 17:12:49 It’s still amusing to me how many penny stock traders (people who trade scammy stocks for a living) fell for the Trump scam ‘hook, line and sinker’.  #Idiocracy
2897 2018-02-17 17:12:18 KHC & KMB nom nom nom I own plenty of stocks lefty. Great time to be in the market if you're not id suggest at least get a 401k
2898 2018-02-17 17:12:16 Of course he would have. The point is w/o bump stocks or semi automatics you can’t kill as many and it would take a lot longer.Stop the ridiculousness. No 1 wants to take away all guns.Thats FOX News and heads of NRA instilling fear. There isNO reason for civilians to haveBS orSA
2899 2018-02-17 17:11:41 Don’t buy me no bullshit gift ion care bout dat shit buy me a block of penny stocks
2900 2018-02-17 17:11:34 You buy Bitcoin on the Cash app or stocks on the Robinhood app? It will be interesting how the instruments they offer gain with increased exposure.
2901 2018-02-17 17:11:08 Assault rifles-AR-15’s, 50 round magazines & bump stocks have no place in civilian population. Why wld R’s allow this?...Answer-NRA. Call yr Senators/House Reps 202-225-3121 & local offices. Ban these, close gun show loopholes, universal background checks. SENSIBLE GUN CONTROL!
2902 2018-02-17 17:11:00 I'm starting to feel like one of the most important things we can do is start teaching kids the difference between levels and trends and stocks and flows. Confusion on those points is pretty corrosive.
2903 2018-02-17 17:10:41 Assuming neither is full auto they are both the same, thank goodness these idiots can't get automatic weapons.  Bump stocks etc. Should be outlawed.
2904 2018-02-17 17:10:36 This is awesome list... Could you please suggest the new entry levels of all these stocks?
2905 2018-02-17 17:10:18 I find that it is much easier to figure out what I own, in the crypto currency world than in the world of stocks.  Scams and weak projects are obvious.  Any viable project has a solid guarantee that you can't be diluted out of your position.
2906 2018-02-17 17:10:11 Spent the afternoon going through charts, adding to and strengthening my over all stratergy. Recording the over shoot on rejections to get an ave. Stop loss. Looking at higher lows and lower highs on stocks down on the day and down gappers. Pleased with the session.
2907 2018-02-17 17:09:21 Like fast and furious hmm or bump stocks your administration approved move on the grown ups got this think this asshole voted for u as well
2908 2018-02-17 17:07:24 A man with the tagline "Last man on Earth w/o a podcast." should think twice about calling anyone jealous Please feel free to tweet something about your disney stocks btw, you've only done it the last several times i've talked to you. It still means absolutely nothing to me.
2909 2018-02-17 17:07:07 Stock market may get big jitters in comming weeks specially banking stocks
2910 2018-02-17 17:06:23 Using easily disproven statements such as "Obama approved bump stocks" is so inflammatory and purely ignorant, that a real person would not  say it.  Only a mutton headed Russian or paid NRA BOT looking to cause dissent would be so profoundly foolish as to say it.

2914 2018-02-17 17:05:01 Yes. Longer waiting periods, higher age, ban on assault weapons & bump stocks. Complete background check. No mentally ill, no domestic violence or sexual assault history. Classes, exams, and registration of all other firearms. Make it harder to get than a driver's license.

2916 2018-02-17 17:03:28 When is hot stocks coming back on YouTube? @cnbcafrica @paul_vestact any info?
2917 2018-02-17 17:03:18 hi, do you have stocks? can i buy them?
2918 2018-02-17 17:03:09 Bump stocks are still legal.
2919 2018-02-17 16:59:16 Yes mental Heath is a big part of the issue in the US. But as some one who is pro-gun, I still find it unnecessary for people to own tactical weapons, AR series weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines.
2920 2018-02-17 16:58:42 This series of tweets doesn’t justify doing nothing to eliminate bump stocks. Or banning clips that allow shooters to reload quickly and kill more innocent people. Work harder to resolve this issue. As a Floridian, I know what I’ll do to fix Sen/rep’s who do nothing (more).
2921 2018-02-17 16:58:30 During the AWB, American's could still purchase ALL of the AK'S and AR'S we wanted. So technically NOT a BAN.

The BAN only consisted of restrictions

AR/AK could only be sold with 10 rd mags

No collapsible stocks

No muzzle brakes/flash suppressors

No lugs for bayonets
2922 2018-02-17 16:58:29 buying stocks, thats more work than they make you money
2923 2018-02-17 16:58:27 must never forget the Emkay fat finger setback where investors money was held up till they recouped themselves. When u deal with bank who is a broker, this may never happen. I do not like the Discount Broker concept. Its my money which is with them. My views may be biased.
2924 2018-02-17 16:57:24 I talked about this the other day. I could absolutely see this as the future of online shopping, it'd be amazing to put on a vr headset amd truly view a product if they went that route!
2925 2018-02-17 16:55:46 risk x10000000 - can you invest in penny stocks in many (any?) company sponsored 401Ks?  Maybe.

Again, can they - yes. will they - yes.  

SHOULD they NO. it's a bad bad bad idea to enable stupidity.
2926 2018-02-17 16:55:41 Have you ever seen a person learning to be a lawyer in 2 weeks, becoming a millionaire and the best in his field?! Probably not, so why do you think trading is different! @timothysykes

2927 2018-02-17 16:54:33 And I’m not even talking about getting rid of all SA-rifles. Which never should have been in the public’s hands in the first place. It’s too late for a recall. But we can’t even talk about prevention for future purchases without being shutdown. I mean bump stocks are still legal
2928 2018-02-17 16:54:16 @Ali_Trades I would say swing package, but covers mostly stocks
2929 2018-02-17 16:53:52 How come their right to own an assault rifle/bump stocks trumps my right to keep my kids alive!
2930 2018-02-17 16:53:05 CNN and the others are laughing stocks in this country. No one believes them anymore. I know people who watch for laughs!
2931 2018-02-17 16:51:57 There’s a thing called electoral college. Duh also 4 million votes voided due to compromised machines. Obama beat Romney and McCain like there was a choice Hillary needs to be in jail. Server in the basement. Holy crap!
2932 2018-02-17 16:51:45 But please, please keep buying those Big Pharma stocks which are drugging up the kids with SSRI's which each of these shooters was on. Why is is the US has more drugged up kids than any other country in the world?
2933 2018-02-17 16:50:43 Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, semi-automatic guns, the NRA, Gun Manufacturers AND Their Gun Lobby—NOW.
#BanAssaultRifles
2934 2018-02-17 16:50:28 It means a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks.   That’s a good start.
2935 2018-02-17 16:50:19 See how DCA - dollar cost averaging pays off. Buying equal amounts over time just works. Works in your 401k. Buying stocks or crypto. #Investment #advice
2936 2018-02-17 16:49:21 1. Waiting Periods
2. Ammo Capacity limitations
3. Ban Bump Stocks
4. Don't allow certain weapons be purchased at gun shows without any licensing. A 19 year old shouldn't be able to buy a rifle on the drop of a hat

I could go on and on.
2937 2018-02-17 16:49:15 looked for stocks bounce off 50dma and above prior pivot, eg. AMZN. FDN / 50d B, new closing high Thurs. RS.
2938 2018-02-17 16:48:51 This Veteran REFUSES  to believe that we cannot change. I believe in the 2nd Amendment. But I believe more that the world would be a better place w/o assault rifles & bump stocks on the market. #CommonSenseGunControl I BELIEVE we can Do. Better.
2939 2018-02-17 16:48:36 This is good. Thank you. Somewhat new to [swing] trading (Crypto since Aug 2017, Stocks since 2015). This market is teaching me I need different strategies. And looking now, as a US citizen, to find ways to short as seems BitMex isn't an option. I'm a programmer & like Math 1/
2940 2018-02-17 16:48:09 Why aren't bump stocks illegal yet, @JimPressOffice @SenRonJohnson?Do your job.
2941 2018-02-17 16:47:24 Of course! Privatization of Food Stamps would benefit Congressmen and women who decided to invest in just two or three companies, which would make them extremely rich, same with anyone in Congress who has stocks in Private Prisons, Water Thieves et al. #AMJoy #reiders #GOPTaxScam
2942 2018-02-17 16:45:38 The problem is we don’t want the 2nd amendment gone, we want it to be a much more difficult process to purchase such guns and make things like bump stocks illegal, also if you can’t be mature enough to purchase a beer you shouldn’t be allowed to purchase an AR15, so no just no
2943 2018-02-17 16:45:24 icicidirect !
2944 2018-02-17 16:44:59 We, the people - DEMAND -   No bump stocks. No Countrywide Concealed Carry Reciprocity. No silencers! No cop killer rounds. No super shooter magazines. No sales without completed background checks.  WE DEMAND SANITY!
Before November!
2945 2018-02-17 16:44:43 Anyone know how taxes and stocks work? Cuz I bought a stock and got a tax document and idk I'm confused trying to adult. Send help
2946 2018-02-17 16:44:33 @XXIIJMP I grabbed it a while back now bc I wanted to get some Cana stocks into my port. That’s the cherry on top w this stock- legalization
2947 2018-02-17 16:43:37 @BalakrishnanR In your article in moneylife, you recommend getting rid of stocks that are under water. Perhaps it is better to do so after 1st April so that you can set off your losses against gains under the new Tax regime?

2952 2018-02-17 16:41:09 @TeamCavuto if the NRA supports outlawing bump stocks, why hasn’t anything been done with that? A great question!

2955 2018-02-17 16:40:24 They couldn't even get the Republicans to agree to ban bump stocks or allow gun violence research, but sure. 
2956 2018-02-17 16:39:46 You won't get that, probably not ever, so concentrate on getting rid of assault rifles, large magazines and bump stocks, better background checks in all states, no unrecorded sales at gun shows - the sensible things we can get with Democrats in control. Vote for Dems!

2959 2018-02-17 16:36:34 Exactly. So, people. No more outdoor events. Too dangerous. Stay in your houses. 

Why the hell are bump stocks even legal?
2960 2018-02-17 16:36:13 Client Q: "Lots of stocks where TC2000, Open Insider, Finviz and Nasdaq don’t agree."  Any reliable Insider Trades databases out there? Txs!
2961 2018-02-17 16:35:50 Isn't trading the VIX similar to betting on who wins the coin toss in the Super Bowl. I just don't understand trading volatility. I'd rather own value and growth stocks. I guess there will always be get rich quick gimmicks out there.
2962 2018-02-17 16:35:33 PP does not pay for them. Taxpayers do not pay for them. NRA spends billions keeping army assault weapons & bump stocks for teens to buy.Also legal for mentally ill but, thanks to Murderer trump.
2963 2018-02-17 16:35:09 Some stocks are suppose to be owned forever.
2964 2018-02-17 16:34:42 @BullishFlex whenever the bear market comes, many a who they thought were/are great traders will get wiped out, many havent traded one, its been 9 years. Past 3 weeks, a bear market = 1-2 years of same. You dont buy drops & you dont add dips. Penny stocks die, volume disappears.
2965 2018-02-17 16:34:35 Robin - stocks are very low on certain items and sizes at the moment and so the whole range has been temporarily removed - do check back soon 
2966 2018-02-17 16:33:46 Tout dépend de leur stocks d'armes...et de leur volonté de s'en servir...et de la distance qui le sépare du pape actuel...
2967 2018-02-17 16:32:30 Listen. Military-grade weapons have no place in civilian life. Period. Banning assault rifles, bump stocks and any related paraphernalia, THAT'S the kind of sensible gun control 80% of Amercians are begging for.  
What are you looking for, a pat on the back?
2968 2018-02-17 16:32:21 Because he is one considering more civilians have died in the Middle East during his administration than under all eight years of Obama’s. He couldn’t care less about 17 kids or the 18 school shootings in five months. He’s thinking “great! My gun stocks have gone up!”

2972 2018-02-17 16:30:54 I'd ban the AR-15 and similar guns, plus bump stocks. Hard to give facts to emotional people, but their lack of facts just hurts their cause
2973 2018-02-17 16:30:34 I love #BigBadWolfBooksPH very much!! 
I like how the staff are very accommodating to the customers,  they even apologize for not having stocks of the books that we want.
2974 2018-02-17 16:30:31 This is why we have a national guard, active duty military cannot be deployed with our own boarders. We created a militia. There is no need for anyone to have ar-14, except maybe swat, Bumb stocks, semi auto that it takes basically a drill to make fully auto. lets be honest here.
2975 2018-02-17 16:30:27 No, It is time to ban guns with over 6 bullets and those bullets should have to be reloaded one at a time. Ban bump stocks and magazines too.
2976 2018-02-17 16:30:02 Guns don't shoot themselves.Shooters at fault. AR-15's shoot one bullet at a time. Ones on TV shooting multiple bullets have bump stocks.That should be outlawed.Teachers should be able to be trained & armed. Veterans armed at schools. Mental health probs should preclude purchase.

2978 2018-02-17 16:29:18 I’ve learned more about taxes, stocks, annuities, and general finance this first week of my job than I ever did in school. Aren’t they supposed to be preparing you for your future? The education system failed me 
2979 2018-02-17 16:28:52 Spending this morning going through my watchlists. Seeing some stocks back at ATH’s or approaching.  Notable as well, seeing a lot running into resistance. Will get into more detail with these tomorrow as I build my list for the week.
2980 2018-02-17 16:27:31 Yes and bump stocks too
2981 2018-02-17 16:26:46 Ok so the tax cuts are making our American businesses stronger. Isn't that what trump promised. I also have stocks and I'm middle class. So I'm making money to. And every employee of that company that has 401k is making money to. Just keep doing what your doing

2986 2018-02-17 16:24:07 How about sponsoring legislation to ban assault weapons,  bump stocks and silencers. I know you have the courage to stand up to the gun long and the NRA
2987 2018-02-17 16:23:54 This really is a simple fix. Ban all ar-15 and ak-47 sales. There is no reason anyone should have assult rifles with exception to military and police.  There soul purpose is to cause mass casualties.  Ban the sale of bump stocks also.
2988 2018-02-17 16:22:59 Pretty confident it's a contaminant that rides on transfer tools. It resists ethanol-n'-flame and spreads through serial transfer and concurrently-made glycerol stocks. I'm assuming it came in from a field collection with a natural infection, but no way to know which one.

 Ready Stocks 

2991 2018-02-17 16:21:37 The only way to solve this problem is to take away the availability of guns. No more assault rifles. No more high volume magazines, bump stocks, or silencers. As long as there are tools to kill en masse, people will be killed en masse. To think guns make us safer is delusional.
2992 2018-02-17 16:21:09 Ever heard of bump stocks? You know, the thing that they were talking about banning after Vegas, and then quietly did absolutely nothing about.
AR-15's are legal, even for a mentally deranged 19-year-old, Trump and the Republicans have made sure of that.
2993 2018-02-17 16:20:32 Agreed.  Rational people would support reasonable ownership requirements and oppose universal concealed carry, silencer (hearing protection act), and bump stocks.  We license people to drive cars and they're not deadly weapons.
2994 2018-02-17 16:19:46 came a long way from blasting, tech's on blocks RT @Ayemofsigns: let my cash invest in stocks - nas
2995 2018-02-17 16:19:36 Yeah, just like ATF reviewed numb stocks.  Nothing is going to change.  The GOP likes heavily armed militias to keep them in power when elections won’t.
2996 2018-02-17 16:19:18 It’s volatile because of its small marketcap compared to stocks. It’s a new technology which is getting adopted slowly. I’m pretty sure this guy doesn’t even know the true meaning of what a “ Blockchain “ is without having to google it, Yet still goes out their and talks shit

2998 2018-02-17 16:18:22 But you do not need an AR-15, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, or any of that other bullshit in order to maintain your Second Amendment rights.

3001 2018-02-17 16:17:16 You are in dreamland if you think this will work. Schools can't even fund the basic supplies or personnel (teachers) yet you want to hire and arm people to respond? How about taking the damn assault rifles w/bump stocks & multi capacity clips out of circulation?

3008 2018-02-17 16:13:01 Well people do not understand that corporations have record level debts, have given up on making a profits the old fashioned way, rely on debt, and make money through "regulatory profits," buy back their own stocks to falsely inc their own stock price, and create phony bonuses.
3009 2018-02-17 16:12:57 It's more effective in politics than in stocks
3010 2018-02-17 16:12:08 I am trying to find a dunk I saw years ago, perhaps you can help where Google has failed me.  I don't know who it was, but after the dunk hanging from the rim he produced a newspaper and checked his stocks...
3011 2018-02-17 16:11:36 You don't need an AR-15 to hunt or protect your family. Bump stocks skirt the law and are unnecessary for hunting or home protection. Weapons such as this belong to the military, not average citizens.
3012 2018-02-17 16:10:58 You are better than they are simply because you're stronger. You are there competing & they are not. They are the loser's supporting a loser that is killing this country. Their "go to" would be the stocks. Sorry, but stocks have been on the climb since 2009. DJT is a TYRANT! I<3U
3013 2018-02-17 16:10:37 Here's some policy:
- Re-instate the ban on Assault Style and Military Style Weapons
- Ban modifications like Bump Stocks
- Limit or ban high capacity magazines
- Expand and Nationalize the background checks
for a start
3014 2018-02-17 16:10:26 Totally agree. Was totally exhausted on Friday. My plan for Tuesday is not ready yet, but I think I will play the tape and focus on a few selected stocks, like JNJ on Friday. That was a great win. It broke out on super volume, 50% gain.

3017 2018-02-17 16:08:43 K but why are bump stocks legal for civilians? What possible reason could you have for that? Neither hunting nor self defense require that
3018 2018-02-17 16:08:30 porinju me quality stocks
3019 2018-02-17 16:07:41 Ban all long guns, semi-automatic rimfire rifles, shotguns, pump-action shotguns, bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles. Buy them back & melt them down. Is that specific enough for you?
3020 2018-02-17 16:06:56 Decline was epic, as has been the recovery. It's actually going to be simple to figure out the next move based on levels & a couple of key stocks. I'll discuss in my Weekend Review VIDEO!
3021 2018-02-17 16:06:06 @chengevelyn Hi - re your article on SEC suspending 3 stocks, think the Patrick Johnson who links them is a Super Bowl winner. Seems newsworthy!
3022 2018-02-17 16:05:43 Up the age to 21 to own a gun. Ban automatic, semi- automatic and bump stocks. Any gun that can shoot mutiple rounds without reloading. We all heards those rounds go off, those kids had no time to defend themselves.
3023 2018-02-17 16:04:49 You shouldn't be able to buy AR-15 non Bump stocks Period. Leo's and our Military only. Harsh penalties if these guns are found on a person, taxation, registration and complete background check.

3030 2018-02-17 16:03:16 1st they think it makes them safe 2nd reason afraid the GOV will not allow you buy that gun. And now you have to ask WHY those guns is it because they have people they want to shoot too? Or does it give them Ideas. THE BIG THING FREE ADS. there only in print gun stocks on TV
3031 2018-02-17 16:02:30 This is legit company and they are really working hard to make it successful.I am planning to buy big chunk of stocks of this company.
3032 2018-02-17 16:00:36 Bitcoin is attracting many individuals who have never traded stocks and have no clue about investments, etc.  That's a great thing, but we need to re-teach them supply and demand, as well as the benefits of a secure and decentralized form of money.
3033 2018-02-17 16:00:24 Scott's police dept didn't take action either, due to citizens right, should all especially Scott RESIGN? No?  Put the ban back on assault rifles and ban bump stocks now!
3034 2018-02-17 15:59:38 I agree.Banning assault style weapons/bump stocks is common sense to me. People don’t need those weapons. No one is saying take all guns.
3035 2018-02-17 15:59:07 I heard stocks go up and down sometimes
3036 2018-02-17 15:59:05 - make 21 legal age of buying a gun
- require drivers license like test for firearm purchase
- ban silencers and bump stocks
- ban clips over 10 rounds

3037 2018-02-17 15:58:43 Save your fake sympathy.Ban automatic weapons, bump stocks & high-capacity magazines for guns. If you can't do this it proves you don't care
3038 2018-02-17 15:58:41 Indeed, it does say the right to bear arms. Which, at the time were muskets. No way for the founding fathers to foresee AR-15s and bump stocks. And you just ignored the “well-regulated militia” part. I’ll wait...
3039 2018-02-17 15:57:46 Nagpapakita sa newsfeed ko yung mga article about stocks, sign ba 'to


3040 2018-02-17 15:57:23 Actually, let me correct myself.   Due to bump-fire stocks, which I support the banning of for consistency with 1980's automatic weapons ban laws, we do have such access.
3041 2018-02-17 15:56:56 The DeLorean was powered by the Flux Capacitor not a Tesla coil ... But the most unbelievable part of this episode is that Harry's stocks fresh basil :)
3042 2018-02-17 15:56:53 "The only person that can cause you to have a bad result in stocks is yourself"....so why not buy $RCMH on Tuesday at the open and start your week off right!
3043 2018-02-17 15:56:28 Thanks Alfie, ya you have been right on target. Have you had a look at NDX? It seems the tech stocks have been way stronger then anything else.
3044 2018-02-17 15:56:12 FT. @RuddFc 3 City 3. Stocks made it 2-2, hosts went back in front before Gleeson equaliser. City should’ve won with the last kick but only take a point.
3045 2018-02-17 15:55:25 #guns #gunreform  18 year olds can't drink legally, but can buy military style assault weapons, bump stocks, silencers. We need common sense reform.
3046 2018-02-17 15:54:44 ところで各位明日何時に幕張行きます？？
3047 2018-02-17 15:54:33 This needs to be exposed. America has a very short memory. Another example bump stocks never dealt with.
3048 2018-02-17 15:54:25 I bet all these politicians have mad amounts of money in the stocks of weapons companies on top of the nra support.
3049 2018-02-17 15:53:44 I can get you into stocks if you really bout it
3050 2018-02-17 15:52:24 Because murderers breaking the law care about other laws banning bump stocks. smh
3051 2018-02-17 15:51:31 So it seems @DrAMSinghvi and his family has stocks in Nirav Modi’s company and one of his properties was rented by #NiravModi.. 
And Mr Singhvi also said he has many other properties across country.. 

एक छापा तो इन properties पे भी बनता है boss.. #MEA #ED #CBI
@nsitharaman
3052 2018-02-17 15:50:51 That's gang sign for 'Sell more bump stocks'.
3053 2018-02-17 15:50:47 @realDonaldTrump  a COWARD in not immediately speaking out AND acting about gun control  and protecting our children; parental liability, msg to lock up your  guns, laws for universal bground checks, no bump-stocks, no AR-15s. So easy. So Sad. @FLGovScott  @marcorubio @FoxNews
3054 2018-02-17 15:50:22 Not all NRA members are paying legislators and no one is saying that but the leaders are paying them to keep bump stocks and Assault weapons in everyone’s hands  even the mentally ill!!
3055 2018-02-17 15:50:09 Investors should start looking at entry points in cannabis Stocks. Pick 5 producers and pick 5 juniors CBW.v is like an ETF- it should be in everyone's cannabis  portfolio.  You can't go wrong if you do your due diligence and buy best of Breed. 2019 will be a great year!
3056 2018-02-17 15:49:57 That’s possible, but I’d also be in favor of making certain modifications illegal; extended mags, bump stocks, etc. and severely changing how purchasing an AR style gun is made. We literally don’t know how guns laws will change mass murder but I’d rather try and be wrong than not
3057 2018-02-17 15:49:31 We had a ban on "Rambo" style guns. As for bump stocks...well it is illegal to saw off a stock so? And same with cranks, you are not supposed to modify a gun turning it Auto.
 These should be easy things to fix.
3058 2018-02-17 15:49:22 Raise the ammunition tax also but all these increases does nothing to existing stocks which have been out of control for decades. Remember the sales frenzy when Obama was elected?
3059 2018-02-17 15:48:51 I’m gun owner and myHusband and I would vote immediately on gun reform and to get rid of large magazines for guns and bump stocks and semi automatic weapons
3060 2018-02-17 15:48:48 And by the way, all of my investments, stocks and 401K’s are exploding! Thank you Mr. President!
3061 2018-02-17 15:47:40 usapang stocks dito potek haha gusto ko nadin magtrabaho
3062 2018-02-17 15:47:34 平行線...
3063 2018-02-17 15:47:32 Republicans are saying it’s to early to talk about gun regulations, they want more facts. Ok, if it’s to early for this shooting can we now talk about bumper stocks and assault rifles from the Vegas shooting or you need more time on that too?
3064 2018-02-17 15:47:22 "weapons of war" are banned already. these guys are not using "weapons of war" they are using ordinary rifles (some with add ons that  let them fire more often)
ban the bump stocks and the other add ons that actually change rate of fire.  without that? its a rifle like any rifle
3065 2018-02-17 15:47:20 U r NOT a PATRIOT if u think putin or cheating 2 win elections is ok. I am NOT talking abt the economy when I say that. If u really understood economics u would know that Wall St/stocks doing good is NOT a good indicator of the condition of the economy - only benefits 1%/Corps
3066 2018-02-17 15:46:59 Someone was practically giving $dvrs away on stocks exchange earlier today
3067 2018-02-17 15:46:19 Wow! Your such an outlaw. Maybe you should sell all of the millions you made from facebook stocks and give it to charity.
3068 2018-02-17 15:46:17 @SenFeinstein NRA says S. 1916: Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act goes beyond bump stocks! So remove everything else and lets just get rid of bump stocks!
3069 2018-02-17 15:46:01 Maybe I’ll find someone to settle down w when my stocks rise instead keep dropping. Currently down .53 cents 
3070 2018-02-17 15:45:00 Not tried any RF pads yet, need to find somewhere that stocks them nearby first.
3071 2018-02-17 15:44:48 Made my first #stocks purchase ever yesterday and I'm already having nightmares about the future of it. This stuff is stressful man. Don't let me down Aurora!
3072 2018-02-17 15:43:03 @markminervini  Dear Mark, 
I have just read your book ‘Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard’ - a really great book, with very good examples how to find and enter to very best growing stocks!
3073 2018-02-17 15:42:11 OMG I can’t believe the NRA gave that kid 10 grand. He probably used it to buy his AssaultRifle15 and high capacity armor piercing bump stocks. Nice headline losers.
3074 2018-02-17 15:42:04 So Ricardo, one of the greatest mind in economics, ignored that machinery, materials and other stocks were required for production. He also wrote provinces but really meant industries. And you expect to bring down neoclassical trade theory which such embarrassing arguments?
3075 2018-02-17 15:40:57 On a different note, technical studies of price charts of the bankindex and individual bank stocks incl pvt banks suggest impending doom
3076 2018-02-17 15:40:08 Why does the NRA give you millions?
Why has the NRA rated you A+?
Have you voted to ban semi-automatic and automatic guns?
Have you voted to ban bump stocks?
#GunControlNow
3077 2018-02-17 15:40:06 That's a sticky one if DFM involved. Suspect resolution depends on who has responsibility for ATR ... IFA or DFM.
3078 2018-02-17 15:39:59 Rather what happened to theNRA? Their focus used to be gun safety, now silencers and bump stocks are OK. I used to be a competitive shooter but injuries and age have ended the competitive part.

3083 2018-02-17 15:37:01 I know you're begging me. But if my stocks and mutual funds and cryptocurriences drop I might need to be online to monitor them. I can only take advice from people I can talk about them with. Its my passion now next to being negative.
3084 2018-02-17 15:35:58 end assault rifles, automatics, semi-automatics, bump stocks, etc. also access to military grade explosives, eg grenades. c'mon people, ffs. #CommonSenseGunLaws
3085 2018-02-17 15:35:57 The agency also seized stocks of gold, diamond and other precious stones worth Rs 5100 crore. Soon Nirav Modi will be behind the Bars and congress will not get their hideout #CongressPNBscam
3086 2018-02-17 15:35:50 I'm definitely for better background checks involving mental health Banning Bump stocks as well. But 2 think we will be able to confiscate all weapons is unrealistic and not with in the constitution. I'm a wheelchair bound man and need my weapons 2 protect my home and family.
3087 2018-02-17 15:35:16 So the blame game has already started, even before we go to hell in a handcart. What do you suggest for those you clearly regard as traitors. The stocks? The gallows?

3092 2018-02-17 15:30:36 And banning all guns obviously won’t happen, but what about semi automatics and bump stocks? We don’t NEED those for recreation, and if you can’t give those up to literally save hundreds of lives, that’s extremely sad.
3093 2018-02-17 15:30:11 I find in this market I am better off just playing $spy $spx ETFs vs single stocks.
3094 2018-02-17 15:30:07 Stocks: more bearish than bullish
3095 2018-02-17 15:29:55 Yea because that will stop criminals. Canada had a gun registry that cost billions for nothing. Bum stocks and high capacity mags are illegal here. But give a couple hours and I could track then down.
3096 2018-02-17 15:29:32 everything is fine, just keep buying stocks
3097 2018-02-17 15:28:53 Posting the taken art around isn't fun to many but modifying the art is even worse.  In a lot of cases, it just plain feels like being violated.  There are countless stocks and some artists don't mind you playing around with their work so do so with those.
3098 2018-02-17 15:28:45 Had an alert on my phone yesterday to let me know that one of my #Fiat stocks had moved 2.5%  - quick time drop the stock and buy in lower!!! #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #YouthOfTodayHaveNoFfkingIdeaWhatTheyHaveHere
3099 2018-02-17 15:28:39 #investing #comedy #podcast a fun dive into how human behavior can predict moves in the market averages and individual stocks. The hunt for the next 10 banger begins!
3100 2018-02-17 15:28:36 There will be much document shredding and maybe a few bonfires as well as incinerators. Hard drives could end up in river in concrete blocks. Destroying of cell phones and clearing out valuables, stocks and bonds! Better stop there, I don't want them to take any tips.
3101 2018-02-17 15:28:21 It'd be nice to do, but personal shop stocks aren't something we can currently implement like we could in the days after the trade restriction features were created.
3102 2018-02-17 15:28:18 A .223 hunting rifle with a clip is the exact same gun, it just doesn’t look as scary. This is a fact! also 270s, 7 mm, etc... put a clip in those, same thing but they’re hunting rifles. I can see restricting clip size and banning bump stocks....
3103 2018-02-17 15:28:04 And ban bump stocks.
3104 2018-02-17 15:28:03 There has never been a more exciting time to dribble stocks! #auspol
3105 2018-02-17 15:27:21 My apprehension is either she has invested in stocks of Gitanjali Gems or might have bought jewels which later turns out to be fake.
Clear frustration.
3106 2018-02-17 15:26:52 Gun control isn’t about taking away all guns. Regular civilians don’t need semi automatic weapons or bump stocks.
3107 2018-02-17 15:26:37 I’m being clear and honest here. If AR 15s were not available to the public, someone planning a mass shooting wouldn’t be able to bet one. If bump stocks were not available...if semi-automatic rifles were not available...
3108 2018-02-17 15:24:50 Yeah like I know some countries have the tampon machines be free instead of 25-75 cents. My local food pantry stocks them. But the price should be reduced and the “luxury tax” in some areas removed
3109 2018-02-17 15:23:41 How would those prevent crimes? One fun a month only hurts collectors.  Bump stocks have been used in a single crime.  You misunderstand what theu do.  Most gun crimes are commited with guns obtain illegally
3110 2018-02-17 15:23:40 Agreed. Vitalik is doing a disservice. Saying it could go to zero is FUD. Stocks could go to zero. He’s saying it more for himself to come off as “righteous” rather than doing it to help ethereum
3111 2018-02-17 15:21:59 Stocks can make you wait for many years and give returns of many years even in a single year. Like a stock which has not given any return in last 4 years and gets doubled in 5th year. You will be fetching 18% CAGR; which is quite good over the period of time.
3112 2018-02-17 15:21:25 my boss is the type to randomly send my teenage self texts about why i should buy stocks. i know this because he just did that.
3113 2018-02-17 15:20:22 Should I invest in bitcoin or stocks? Or both?
3114 2018-02-17 15:19:47 Now's the time to buy Canadian stocks, Fiera Capital's $129-billion CIO sayshttps://lnkd.in/eBDgmQe
3115 2018-02-17 15:19:35 I am not saying outlaw guns. We need policies to help prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, end the iron pipeline by returning to 1 gun a month, ban bump stocks, & support smart gun technology.
3116 2018-02-17 15:19:21 And bump stocks still perfectly okay-dokey
3117 2018-02-17 15:18:56 Guns are part and parcel of every country.  But selling ar15’s bump stocks and even 50 caliber to the public is not common practice elsewhere. Who needs an ar15 for hunting anyways.  And tell me in the last 100 yrs has there been a need for an armed militia??
3118 2018-02-17 15:17:47 Just saw an artist shocked by unauthorized use of a work.  Unless it's  provided as stocks, you have no right to do anything with it except  enjoy.  You may not intend but such behavior is disrespectful as well as  potentially illegal.  DO enjoy, DO NOT steal.
3119 2018-02-17 15:17:33 @JustinPulitzer Hi Justin, how do you size OTM put sales for low volatility stocks such as XOM?  To get a decent premium I would need to risk a ton of margin.  Do you base the number of contracts on a % of your account if you get assigned shares?
3120 2018-02-17 15:15:53 One of your greatest advantages as a microcap investor is the rest of the financial world thinks you’re an idiot for investing in “penny stocks” and that you don’t think deeply about investing. Prove them wrong.
3121 2018-02-17 15:15:45 And it's not like they started out at an extreme. They began with a centrist pov and slowly moved it to an edge where it's impossible to consider gun stocks bans because someone feels that infringes on his rights.
3122 2018-02-17 15:15:30 Right? And wasn't that the big thing after Vegas? 'We're going to make those bump stocks illegal!' That never happened, did it?
3123 2018-02-17 15:14:26 There is NO reason for bump stocks to exist!  The GOP does NOTHING because of being owned by the NRA.

"Having no magic cure" doesn't mean that GOP needs to advocate for more people owing AR-15's. By doing nothing the GOP is complicit.
3124 2018-02-17 15:13:18 Sa Robinson supermarket dito po sa Marikina Sumulong highway po may stocks pa dun ng book ni Meng
3125 2018-02-17 15:12:50 @SpeakerRyan Knee jerk reaction to gun policies? Sandy Hook, Va. Tech, Columbine?  If it were your own child would you take action?  What is it going to take to stop the senseless murder of our children?  Get out of the pocket of the  NRA and ban assault rifles, bump stocks.
3126 2018-02-17 15:12:50 Per Denver ordinance “bump stocks are any device for a pistol, rifle, or shotgun that increases the rate of fire achievable with such weapon by using energy from the recoil of the weapon to generate a reciprocating action that facilitates repeated activation of the trigger.”
3127 2018-02-17 15:11:40 The advisers had complained to the discretionary fund manager about its decision to switch their clients to a fund they did not regard as suitable for their clients.
3128 2018-02-17 15:11:22 Yup. Kay daghan pa kayu stocks didto as of today. Hehehe
3129 2018-02-17 15:11:20 I’m not insisting we do nothing. I never said anything remotely like that. I just said guns save lives. Objectively true. I’m fine banning AR-15’s and bump stocks. I also think schools should have armed guards and metal detectors.
3130 2018-02-17 15:11:00 I remember after the Vegas shooting there was a video of a guy saying they can’t ban bump stocks because he thinks automatic weapons are fun.
3131 2018-02-17 15:10:53 I renounced my membership in the NRA years ago when they defended Teflon covered bullets. I hunt and own several guns. However no one needs Teflon bullets, bump stocks or huge magazines. No rational NRA member can defend their stance. They have made a wrong turn somewhere.
3132 2018-02-17 15:10:40 God Bless America! The only nation on earth where the mentally ill can buy as many guns as the want! Thanks @NRA   & Trump for restoring the clinically defective to arm themselves, bump stocks and all
3133 2018-02-17 15:10:23 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3134 2018-02-17 15:09:53 Re-institute the Obama ban on the sale of AR-15's.  Ban bump stocks. Recall all AR-15's in a 2-year buy back. Plus, universal background checks. If this happens , I'm pretty sure I won't feel like I've lost my freedoms, even though I cannot buy a military-style weapon.

3136 2018-02-17 15:09:19 Having background checks, 14 day hold to do that & banning AK15 type weapons & bump stocks is NOT taking guns away from Americans.
3137 2018-02-17 15:08:54 We know. We saw the video of you repeating that canned phrase on and on heartlessly while ducking in an elevator pressing the button 14 times to avoid questions about you having any action plan. Anything regarding bump stocks? Vegas was months ago.
3138 2018-02-17 15:08:36 Unless it involves vacuum cleaner fishing boats of Donegal, the same boats which have been barred from Australia due to their affect on fish stocks and which we can do nothing about due to EU rules.  So what was that about a 'Nation' once again?
3139 2018-02-17 15:07:36 Good stocks are tennis balls. They bounce back. Rubbish stocks are eggs. When they fall they splatter! A bear market shows the difference
3140 2018-02-17 15:07:11 In this case, the Government should and can be taking action. For example, take away military assault rifles from citizens, ban bump stocks and have universal background checks. These actions taken by the government would help to protect its citizenry from further attacks.
3141 2018-02-17 15:06:40 Show me one example where 15 people invaded someone's home ? No private citizen needs an assault rifle or bump stocks. By the way I own guns and my wife and I have a conceal carry permit. That said we need #GunReformNow
3142 2018-02-17 15:06:27 Thank you.
3143 2018-02-17 15:06:25 That is the gun crowd in a nutshell. I am not anti 2A by any stretch. But, the fear out of the far right on this issue is comical. Gun maker stocks down sharply after O left office. They actually thought he would come for their guns.
3144 2018-02-17 15:03:39 Running through penny stocks, emerging market outlooks, and high yield index. No risk no reward
3145 2018-02-17 15:03:36 w/ lots of guns, ammo & bump stocks. Wiki shows 18 school shootings from 2009-10 when DEMs had majorities in DC.
3146 2018-02-17 15:02:54 So banks muss report billions in profits, still have redundancy exercises but there's no wiggle for lower fees? Things can only remain the same or they'll be worse if fees are lowered? Clearly a your stocks you a defend.
3147 2018-02-17 15:02:09 Stocks and bring us a 10 year and getting
3148 2018-02-17 14:59:42 if generally a true statement.  that a good chunk of the tax cuts go to stock buybacks.  Haven't we effectively pushed 1.  rates higher  2.  us govt debt higher  3.  deficits higher so that corps could buy back stocks at what might end up being peak share prices?
3149 2018-02-17 14:59:28 I agree with you on the bump stocks, but none of the rest.

3152 2018-02-17 14:59:15 @CharlesSchwab For stocks and now futures. And @Gdax @binance_2017 for #Crypto.
3153 2018-02-17 14:58:49 So get it done! Lead a national march to ban assault weapons and bump stocks. To make background checks effective. To do and undo all the things you outlined in this tweet. April 20th is the day. Americans will show up in mass. Challenge corporations to fund this. Stop the NRA!
3154 2018-02-17 14:58:29 The tax cut has not generated jobs. The corporations have said so themselves. They've used the $ to buy back stocks. No expansions, no jobs.
3155 2018-02-17 14:58:06 Please work to support comprehensive reform addresses the semi auto assault weapon & bump stocks, mental health funding and changes, stronger actionable communication between law enforcement and schools, and more. I’ll stand with you. #ParklandStrong #NeverAgain #SoFloEducator
3156 2018-02-17 14:57:49 I'm disgusted beyond belief. Do the @GOP realize they 'shot down' laws preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns as they use 'mental health' as the root of all gun shootings?? How about outlawing bump stocks? Give us a crumb!
3157 2018-02-17 14:57:44 U r incredible when it comes to market understanding.. u r already doing gr8 job & further do marvelous job for millions of Indians by suggesting ur views on stocks & market..it is such a big subject that any other discussion is loss for nation
3158 2018-02-17 14:55:23 Alex - ignore her. She's obviously up tRump's butt...did you check her profile?! She thinks he's some kind of god.  Semi auto weaponry need banned, bump stocks were a really dumb idea & ALL guns need to he registered. Lawn darts are banned in the USA, for pete's sake!
3159 2018-02-17 14:55:01 It isn’t about mental illness
It isn’t about the FBI
It is about AR 15, Bump Stocks, high powered weapons
They are not hunting Bambi
They are mowing down kids
#GunReformNow
3160 2018-02-17 14:54:58 Hard to feel sorry for little Marco when Congress can’t (due to its NRA enslavement) even take a small step, like banning bump stocks, that would be hugely popular AND have at least some chance of reducing the scale of slaughter in a future incident.

3172 2018-02-17 14:47:21 If military style weapons, bump stocks, extended mags background checks, and nationalizing gun regs can’t be debated in Congress, then it sure as hell WILL become part of the national debate during upcoming elections...and it is incumbent upon us to see to it by VOTING!
3173 2018-02-17 14:47:03 Buy These Ants Internet Stocks on Ant New Year
3174 2018-02-17 14:46:52 Easy solution: those billionaires getting millions in lower taxes just spend it ALL stimulating the economy directly, no saving it or investing in stocks. Bc we KNOW better. NFW
3175 2018-02-17 14:46:11 But the original post says advisers have complained the monies ended up in the fund?

How can advised clients end up in a fund the adviser didn't recommend OR if they did, why are they complaining???

Maybe I'm missing something.
3176 2018-02-17 14:46:09 Many Americans would thank congress for THEIR courage in standing up to the NRA and passing some common-sense gun laws - no assault weapons, no bump stocks, required weapon registration, prevention of weapon purchase by mentally unstable. #GunReformNow
3177 2018-02-17 14:46:05 Elana, I honestly appreciate your effort trying to talk sense to these folks. However, Keep in mind that we can't even get bump stocks outlawed. Keep the faith, cooler heads will eventually prevail.
3178 2018-02-17 14:45:49 Majority of Americans didn’t want To lose ACA, didn’t want net neutrality eliminated, didn’t want protections of our land, air & water removed, wanted bump stocks banned-did they listen? NO!
3179 2018-02-17 14:45:21 Invest your life-savings in traditional stocks. Having said that, if you believe that crypto assets will flourish in the next 5-10 years, find the protocols and tokens you think will do well and buy those as a portion of your investment portfolio. 
Millenials what do you think?
3180 2018-02-17 14:44:37 No $ in the oil market huh? Maybe planned parenthoods stocks will go up again someday.
3181 2018-02-17 14:43:47 Yea but Obama’s legalized bump stocks
3182 2018-02-17 14:43:42 Why? It's still working. E.g. bump stocks are still legal.
3183 2018-02-17 14:42:44 What I'm saying is sensible gun control. There's no reason for the average person to own a semiautomatic weapon. People don't need them for hunting or home protection. Outlaw bump stocks. There's ways we can be safer if we're also smarter about it.
3184 2018-02-17 14:42:30 @RepErikPaulsen @amyklobuchar @TinaBrownLM Guns. We need gun control laws NOW. Ban military assault weapons and bump stocks. NOW. Before the next shooting, please. Ten years of silence, thoughts and prayers, has done nothing to solve this problem.
3185 2018-02-17 14:42:24 Yup cause bump stocks n the NRA are the problem lol. The anti gun people get crazier by the minute when rights aren't taken away.
3186 2018-02-17 14:41:45 Ban assault weapons stop the open & conceal carry by private gun owners this is not pioneer days or wild west & we don't care to go back there, cut down amount of guns owned by 1person, no bump stocks for private owners,guns for hunting home protection only. Cure to gun tragedies
3187 2018-02-17 14:40:18 It’s likely secular inflation escalates with deficits, money printing, infrastructure spending, full employment growth...what benefits? Real estate and stocks, especially small cap companies. Also Behavioral Assets. Losers? Bonds with long durations and fixed rates.
3188 2018-02-17 14:40:00 Here's a practical start. Quickly act on clip sizes and bump stocks.  Make it a felony to own a gun and have a psychotropic med prescription with mandatory cross checking between gun registration and med use. Then harness the media to eschew violence in movies and games.
3189 2018-02-17 14:39:51 They will not include tournament where bayonetta is banned while having tournaments in their rankings with customs, different stage list and stocks, which is pretty biased imo
3190 2018-02-17 14:39:25 At least your precious Pepsi Max stocks are unharmed.
3191 2018-02-17 14:39:01 I suspect many on twitter don't understand UCITS/UCIS/UT/OEIC ... it's a public post and my interpretation was that a UCIS was used but the post said UCITS so was seeking clarification given the gulf between the two.
3192 2018-02-17 14:36:41 I am so tired of Republicans using this quote. No one wants to ban guns we want to ban assault rifles, automatic weapons, bUmp stocks etc. no one wants to take away your handgun for protection. No one wants to take your rifle away so you can hunt. They never really listen.
3193 2018-02-17 14:36:09 It’s time to disarm our citizens. They can keep their handguns, even though it’s an over interpretation of the 2nd amendment that allows even that. They can keep their shotguns. But bump stocks, AR-15s must go. We want to be like Canada. Kids don’t die there like here.
3194 2018-02-17 14:35:50 These kids don’t want your prayers and thoughts. They don’t want you or Rubio or Scott. What they want is someone that will say the word gun and gun laws only pertaining to the AR 15 and bumper stocks. They’re not asking for much!!
3195 2018-02-17 14:35:39 @smerconish how is it Rick Scott -his state again, the police chief overseeing 39 calls, the Congress for not prohibiting gun stocks and allowing deranged citizens with guns and yes, the AMA for HIPPA confidentiality of mental disability among us..why are they immune from firing?
3196 2018-02-17 14:32:42 Quality stocks are like tennis ball , they bounce back after falling.
Inferior stocks are eggs, don't need to tell what happens when they fall.
Stick with our recommendations
3197 2018-02-17 14:32:42 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3198 2018-02-17 14:32:21 That's an advice issue and the member should complain.

Exit penalties fail TCF 6 (barriers to exit). If not explained, fails on compliance / advice too. 

These issue should not get lost in the midst of BSPS transfer advice issues BUT I feel it's all being lumped together.
3199 2018-02-17 14:32:04 We can't even get bump stocks banned - I'm fine with it but it seems to be an empty reach - plus the way the NRA raises money is by telling people - they want to take your guns away from you

3205 2018-02-17 14:29:37 He’s right, S E. We still haven’t had a conversation about Vegas and bump stocks. Ryan say’s he’s waiting for the ATF to review their guidelines. Now bump stocks are not part of any conversation. Can you imagine a silencer on that weapon in Fl. More targets standing confused?

Wall St. has its thumb on the World's pulse in terms of expected events, and this one was through USGS.
3209 2018-02-17 14:28:09 1 No bump stocks
2. Clips that hold no more that 10 rounds
3210 2018-02-17 14:27:38 Corruption is taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NRA and doing nothing about the sale of bump stocks.
3211 2018-02-17 14:27:23 After news of PNB ₹11,400 crore scam, banking sector stocks lost more than ₹38,000 crore .PNB alone lose more than ₹8,500 crore.....Loss made by news is far more and dangerous than actual loss by fraud #PNBFraud
#NiravModi
3212 2018-02-17 14:26:49 Om te beginnen - iéts. Zie ban op bumper stocks, extended magazines, ... Anything om een moordwapen nog nét dat tikkeltje dodelijker te pimpen.
3213 2018-02-17 14:26:29 Hey there snowflake  feeling a little attacked? if you’re tired of lying in the bed you made then get in your office and legislate some gun control. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and work to lower the number of guns in you state.
3214 2018-02-17 14:26:11 There’s a healthy bout of skepticism with the @PublicProtector studying the High Court’s judgment on the #CIEXReport - she is either not very bright or she is captured. People don’t turn themselves in to laughing stocks, willingly, unless they are CLOWNS! A higher (lower)purpose!
3215 2018-02-17 14:25:56 1week of fall in stocks makes a investor, fund mgr sell tapioca? 
3216 2018-02-17 14:25:38 When I said I believe assault weapons, bump stocks, & high capacity mags should be banned, the responses were just plain nasty. I no longer care. I might not understand the specifics of guns, ammo, & gun laws, but I know gun violence is out of control & something needs to change.
3217 2018-02-17 14:25:35 So should we buy PVT banks stocks?? 
3218 2018-02-17 14:24:56 We do not need assault weapons. Except for military, law enforcement maybe.
We do not need bump stocks and other options for general populations either.
We need to change our views on mental illness.  
We need to foster acceptance of it, support the treatment of it.
3219 2018-02-17 14:24:43 The agency also seized stocks of gold, diamond and other precious stones worth Rs 5100 crore. Soon Nirav Modi will be behind the Bars and congress will not get their hideout #CongressPNBscam

3221 2018-02-17 14:24:20 No...the first 2 years Obama has 60 votes in Senate and control of the House. He didn't pass one gun law or immigration law.
His ATF did ok Bump Stocks, his prosecution of gun law violations was basically nothing.
And now he complains.
3222 2018-02-17 14:23:38 FU We can start by banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines and selling to mentally ill and domestic abusers. Then we can do universal background checks and do studies to see what else can done while still honoring the 2A. NRA members agree but NRA would rather help gun mfrs.
3223 2018-02-17 14:23:34 Listen up you gun worshiping half-wits....

NO ONE wants to ban "all guns"

We want Assault-Style Weapons & Bump Stocks banned.
We want stricter Background Checks.
We want our children safe.
We want our grandchildren safe.
We want the #NRABloodMoney out of Politics.

Get it now?
3224 2018-02-17 14:23:30 If access to rapid fire weapons, modification kits, high volume clips, bump stocks ect... is eliminated the sheer volume of people who die or are injured by idiots on rampages will be significantly reduced. (5-6)
3225 2018-02-17 14:23:04 “Twelve bump-fire stocks were found on firearms recovered from Stephen Paddock's hotel room, said Jill Snyder, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' San Francisco field office.”

3228 2018-02-17 14:19:58 think about this discussion. People want to arm teachers! That's the only answer? More guns?  Close gun show loopholes, ban extended clips, longer waiting periods, require a license for each gun owned to limit the # of guns, ban bump stocks.
3229 2018-02-17 14:16:50 @foxandfriends For God's sake Geraldo, they are NOT ASSUALT WEAPONS, They are semi automatic rifles that look like miilitary weapons. They have plastic stocks and grips instead of wood. AR stands for Armalite Rifle. If you're going to spout off, get your damn facts straight!!
3230 2018-02-17 14:15:50 Nothing? How abt bump stocks/assault weapons ban or at least special registration, not allowing mental patients to get guns, expanded registration, limits on ammo etc... RYAN IS A DISGRACE

3232 2018-02-17 14:14:48 To start... background checks with follow-up, stop arming mentally ill people, registration of ammo, and outlawing semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks that didn't exist when our Founders wrote the Constitution.
3233 2018-02-17 14:13:52 Was hoping NATIONWIDE SCHOOL WALK OUT on MARCH 1st-refuse to return until assault weapons & bump stocks are banned, until universal background checks are mandatory & people that should not have access to weapons R denied. We must break cycle of deadly silence  & inaction.
3234 2018-02-17 14:13:34 Exactly. If they didn't ban bump stocks then, why do anything really serious now? 

People are angry. They're only window dressing to prevent #BlueWave2018. 

The only real solution is to #VoteThemOut
3235 2018-02-17 14:13:22 They are always think progressively. Sunder, what will be the impact if they introduce weekly options on Nifyy 50 stocks? let then do wise things to counter competition.
3236 2018-02-17 14:13:18 Bump stocks are loophole which should be closed, states without FOID cards, private sales without transfer of ownership in some states, no FOID card required for ammo purchase, gun show sales.  These are all easily executable.  The FBI cannot be blamed for Florida.
3237 2018-02-17 14:12:53 Find you some good penny stocks..invest a lil in that..
3238 2018-02-17 14:12:49 Blaming the FBI is a great and proven deflection away from the real problem, assault rifles, high capacity mags, bump stocks and an 18 year old purchasing a gun. GOP will protect NRA at all costs, including the lives of our children. #GunReformNow #TheResistance
3239 2018-02-17 14:12:46 Wrong, Obama had 8 years to change gun laws and  outlaw semiautomatic guns as well as bump stocks. He did Nothing!  Be I informed before you point blame please!
3240 2018-02-17 14:10:48 Will USA block import increases from  all sources (like Sweden) to prevent trade barrier jumping? Have importers already increased their stocks? Combination of huge increase in domestic demand and stricter trade barrier give record price hikes?
3241 2018-02-17 14:10:40 Your words mean nothing!  You HAVE to step up and make an example!!  You are in the position to face the HARD TRUTHS, BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS, BAN BUMP STOCKS, FUND MENTAL HEALTH/ADDICTION TREATMENT!!!  Stop flapping your jaws and DO SOMETHING!!!
3242 2018-02-17 14:08:40 Bump stocks, not bumper stocks (sorry about the previous misspelling) need to be banned along with all assault type weapons!
3243 2018-02-17 14:07:27 Thoughts and prayers and thank you’d are not enough!  A ban on assault weapons and bump stocks would be an active answer!  You just do not have the ballsvto suggest or support!

3245 2018-02-17 14:07:01 Assault rifles, bumper stocks, and mental health/addiction treatment centers.....GOD, we need GOD back in our lives!!  We need to stop accepting what is wrong and do what is right!  MONEY: The root of all things evil!!  ENOUGH!!
3246 2018-02-17 14:06:55 Go buy some stocks.
3247 2018-02-17 14:06:51 Enough thoughts and prayers. Pass real, meaningful, sensible gun control. That’s it. We don’t need assault weapons, high capacity magazines, armor piercing ammunition, bump stocks, among others.
We need: universal background checks that also look for the mentally ill. Seriously.

3251 2018-02-17 14:03:37 Forget the partisan crap. We should start installing metal detectors and auto lock doors in all schools. We should be placing an armed cop in every school. We should ban bump stocks and assault rifles. The FBI Director should resign immediately.
3252 2018-02-17 14:03:18 MA just sent out letters to gun owners to turn over their bump stocks or get jailed, no compensation.. totally unconstitutional so its headed to court. How do they keep getting away with this ?!!!

3263 2018-02-17 13:57:52 8 Steps to end mass shootings : 

Better enforce all laws

Ban all sales to mentally ill 

Ban bump stocks 

Limit magazine capacity 

Ban silencers 

No Fly No Buy 

All sales must require Background Check, License, permit & training
3264 2018-02-17 13:56:39 Sir, they can keep their money in their house or in lockers or else park in stocks, MFs, Bonds, or with fly by night operators fondly called as Blade companies. Banks take deposits for the purpose of lending not for keeping in safe & pay interest to these blokes.
3265 2018-02-17 13:56:38 They couldn't even bring themselves to ban bump stocks after Vegas.
3266 2018-02-17 13:55:18 So, will you advocate for banning bump stocks?  Ghost guns?  How about doing something about assault weapons?  How about enabling the CDC to research gun violence so we can intelligently decide what could make this awful situation better?
3267 2018-02-17 13:54:56 Yeah, remember bump stocks brief discussion post Vegas? Shameful
3268 2018-02-17 13:54:48 It’s their problem! Traders will be there on anything that moves! Who said big picture fundamentals don’t impact the indices, which is aggregate of stocks that contribute to large portion of GDP? Let them trade, don’t worry! It is their money!
3269 2018-02-17 13:54:40 How am I to start to fast when my food stocks are still full??
3270 2018-02-17 13:54:31 There are hundreds of legislative proposals- background checks, mental illness red alert, stopping military-style assault weapons, modifying rifles with bump stocks to fire faster, as the killer in Las Vegas did- that were either killed or weakened by the gun lobby in Congress.
3271 2018-02-17 13:53:23 Of course he is. Every politician like him who accepts #NRABloodMoney is.

What we need is background checks, mandatory waiting periods, bans on bump stocks, and AR-15. I just don’t think any of those things are that radical.

#GunControlNow
3272 2018-02-17 13:53:23 Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and any gun that can shoot more than one bullet at a time
3273 2018-02-17 13:53:08 And just like bump stocks nothing will be done
3274 2018-02-17 13:52:44 Who decides who is NORMAL enough to own guns? If you take antidepressants? Lithium? What? Millions deal w degrees of mental illness- they don’t kill people-but their automatic assault rifles with bump stocks certainly do. #NRAputinPuppet #NRAtraitors #TrumpTraitor
3275 2018-02-17 13:52:13 Qualitative aspects are very imp while investing...read earnings call transcripts to get a drift of management quality...don't just read the transcripts of the stocks you own but others also....connect the dots...
3276 2018-02-17 13:52:01 I’m down with that but until then I’ll just by bump stocks and hellfire triggers
3277 2018-02-17 13:49:38 @porinju Confidence petroleum india ltd sir any tips for this stocks
3278 2018-02-17 13:48:14 Ha more group sale $intc stocks. Monday all red again.
3279 2018-02-17 13:47:43 Congress hasn’t even been able to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting. There is zero reason for this to be legal. Overwhelming majority of Americans want these banned. Congress has done nothing so far. NRA owns us.
3280 2018-02-17 13:47:29 No bump stocks. No Countrywide Concealed Carry Reciprocity. No silencers! No cop killer rounds. No super shooter magazines. No sales without completed background checks.  GET OFF YOUR ASS - Do something to ensure safety!
3281 2018-02-17 13:46:46 The AR was never designed for military use. The reason they get used a lot is cost. Plastic stocks are cheaper than wood, ammo is very cheap due to the amount produced.
3282 2018-02-17 13:46:35 No bump stocks. No Countrywide Concealed Carry Reciprocity. No silencers! No cop killer rounds. No super shooter magazines. No sales without completed background checks.  Do something ... but don't take a knee YOU JERK! November - voters will remember you work for NRA, not them!
3283 2018-02-17 13:46:20 I'm not investing to the chips makers cause China can make. Competition , stocks will down some days. I'm in and out only. Will down next Monday. See low..,.buy dip to make some.,.....
3284 2018-02-17 13:46:11 Mudra Loans will be Next Big whole for PSBs. 
Massive NPAs will be seen. 
Stay away from PSBs Stocks.
#PNBScam #NiravModiScam #PNBFraud
3285 2018-02-17 13:45:51 I'd like to answer that. We are a military family. We need the guns we have. We hunt, we live in a remote area where law enforcement is coming to clean up not protect and we enjoy shooting. We do NOT support bump stocks or military grade weapons like the AR15.
3286 2018-02-17 13:45:49 Ban ak15 & magazines,bump stocks! Brady Bill 2
3287 2018-02-17 13:45:48 Floridians don’t blame you directly, we know you’re weak & highly susceptible to NRA influences. Remind us about your positions/votes on bump-stocks, gun show loop holes, CDC gun violence research, repealing Obama restrictions on sales to mentally ill?
3288 2018-02-17 13:44:17 #bn is at striking distance of 2018 low 25023 giving up the 4.5% recovery into “cap” 26000-26150 (high 26140) which got pushed down to 25700-25850 for 25000-25150; #WhatNext is not good when few pickings left in Bank stocks, but investors would prefer to be in wait & watch mode!
3289 2018-02-17 13:44:05 Machine guns have been legal for last 50 years and all kinds of improvements have been made in machine guns. Bump stocks are a joke. They’re just for people that want to play at soldier and feel like they’re shooting an automatic. I could own an auto, just don’t want one.
3290 2018-02-17 13:42:59 Excellent Sir !!! Appreciate your love for Stocks nd Nature both .. keep it up
3291 2018-02-17 13:40:46 I would love WaPo to keep an ongoing list of businesses that have offered bonuses and wage increases based on the tax reform vs those that have conducted layoffs and have been buying up their own stocks.
3292 2018-02-17 13:40:02 As long as bump stocks and gat triggers can be added to AR-15's we can now call them Assault Rifles and be completely accurate.  They can be made to fire continuously.  Argument over.
3293 2018-02-17 13:38:54 As long as bump stocks and gat triggers can be added to AR-15's we can now call them Assault Rifles and be completely accurate.  They can be made to fire continuously.  Argument over.
3294 2018-02-17 13:38:00 #filmfeb 17 - I don’t actually know if I have five favourite ones, I tend to gravitate to the same film stocks. So here’s my top 3: 1) @ILFORDPhoto FP4+ 2) @ILFORDPhoto HP5+ 3) Fuji Acros 100 (especially for pinhole work due to its handling of the reciprocity failure)
3295 2018-02-17 13:37:49 MARCO, If AR-15s had not been on the market--there would be a LOT FEWER dead people. PUT THEM BACK on the BAN LIST (along with Bump Stocks)
3296 2018-02-17 13:37:07 @johnlewisretail is there any way of telling from your website whether or not a particular branch stocks something please?
3297 2018-02-17 13:37:04 Somewhere there is a Ninja talmbout "I got them Vibranium stocks!"

He will make bread...
3298 2018-02-17 13:36:17 atleast they r not staying in india. n now banks will think 1000 times before committing crime till Modi is PM. once modi is out then this country will become beggars country and stocks will be manipulated . SIP will be stopped.
3299 2018-02-17 13:35:49 I owuld agree with that bill, she can add the elimination of bump stocks to it too.
3300 2018-02-17 13:35:47 The agency also seized stocks of gold, diamond and other precious stones worth Rs
5100 crore. Soon Nirav Modi will be behind the Bars and congress will not get their
hideout #CongressPNBscam
3301 2018-02-17 13:35:44 Bump stocks are not the answer to gun violence any more than making pressure cookers illegal would stop bombings.
3302 2018-02-17 13:35:21 Thank them by protecting them...take AR 15 and bump stocks off the market off the streets...keep your prayers for your own soul...it needs them..
3303 2018-02-17 13:35:00 The agency also seized stocks of gold, diamond and other precious stones worth Rs 5100 crore. Soon Nirav Modi will be behind the Bars and congress will not get their hideout #CongressPNBscam
3304 2018-02-17 13:34:44 If that's more than would be necessary for any peaceful purpose then ban sales of the drums. If not, it's definitely a lot better than being able to fire semi-automatic with bump stocks (that also need banning) and it's still gonna save a lot of lives
3305 2018-02-17 13:34:29 How about adding that there needs to be a 14 days waiting period.  No sale at gun shows. No sales by private owners. Add child lock requirements.  Universal background checks. No bump stocks or cranks.
3306 2018-02-17 13:34:23 Stocks are in big trouble, and #bitcoin isn't out of the woods either. The pain shouldn't last long but it should be the sharpest pain we've ever seen. It's a fucking jungle out there. This business is as cutthroat as it gets.
3307 2018-02-17 13:34:08 C'est "la faute" aux mineurs qui vident les stocks de cartes graphiques du coup les prix flambent vite
3308 2018-02-17 13:33:09 I’m a Tar Heel fan. I’m also the wife of a gun fanatic who’d be the first to tell you there’s zero reason for people to own guns capable of mowing people down like it’s a war zone. You okay with banning bump stocks, or is that taking away your rights too?
3309 2018-02-17 13:32:28 Anyone going to KPOP SHOWDOWN 3 : LOVE WHISPER tomorrow from 12-8pm? An admin will be there to give away FREE TRCNG unofficial photocards! Just show him proof that you liked/follow us on FB and Twt to receive your PC! Limited stocks only~ -TRCNG PHILIPPINES
3310 2018-02-17 13:31:37 Trudeau owns millions of dollars worth of marijuana stocks.  This is the only reason why he wants to decriminalize marijuana. He has a corporate numbered company and multiple partners. True Fact.
#TrudeauMustGo
3311 2018-02-17 13:31:31 I believe in regulating guns like we do cars: license for each class of weapon, mandatory safety training, insurance for each gun, plus background checks, plus proof of some secure storage (I.e. safe, or locked case). Can’t ban guns, but can ban bump stocks and drum mags
3312 2018-02-17 13:31:18 Again, more bullshit. If fully auto had been legal for the last 30 years technology would have focused on making that gun better. De facto auto bump stocks were used by the Vegas shooter to get off more rounds. Fact remains that gun control works, been proven 50 times over.
3313 2018-02-17 13:30:08 I reckon I’m failing applied supervised ....... 
3314 2018-02-17 13:29:55 You must post videos of taking position in stocks. At least we can take something from that.
3315 2018-02-17 13:29:35 Well then why do we have ANY laws at all???? Of course no laws will stop every crime! But if regulations stop even a handful of tragedies then it’s worth it. No one NEEDS an AR 15 or bump stocks.
3316 2018-02-17 13:29:23 2-day sale man diba? Wala najud stocks? 
3317 2018-02-17 13:29:16 For me, the takeaway here is that one shouldn’t have the capability to make such modifications to their firearms. The same principle applies to bump stocks and other modifying accessories.
3318 2018-02-17 13:27:35 Your ONLY PATH to Comforting them is:
--Abandon your NRA BLOOD MONEY
--Vote to RENEW the BAN on AR-15s (& Bump Stocks)
3319 2018-02-17 13:26:47 Getting screwed is not an affair. The only thing that counts for our Playboy President are the results.

Great trade mann
3321 2018-02-17 13:25:39 11 teens die each day from assault rifles, bump stocks or cellphones?     11 each and every day from 
3322 2018-02-17 13:23:24 Because it was a small, insignificant gesture, Mr Micromarco.

Guns- AR-15s and semi-autos with bump stocks- kill huddled kids very, very easily.
3323 2018-02-17 13:23:23 We are set to make MONSTROUS gains on $BTC.X, $ETH.X , $NEO.X and $XRP.X . Learn to trade STOCKS, OPTIONS and CRYPTO with us
3324 2018-02-17 13:23:07 We already restrict guns that have ACTUAL differences in fire rates.
This is being bought by mass shooters because it has a bad boy rep. Thats it.
Stuff that should be restricted, like bump stocks, had nothing to do with the specific gun.
But you are upset  over the brand of gun.
3325 2018-02-17 13:20:59 @Ali_Trades we cover stocks, options and crypto
3326 2018-02-17 13:20:29 Did your JSF come with leather seats and heated throttle.  I went base model but I wish I would have upgraded my stocks pile
3327 2018-02-17 13:20:23 Forbidden Planet Glasgow also stocks #scotland
3328 2018-02-17 13:20:13 Have you  heard of bump stocks? 

Slap that onto your semi and it will be a full auto in all but name
3329 2018-02-17 13:20:13 Lets implement yearly required tests for gun owners, a gun registry. Ban bump stocks. Make magazines that hold obscene amts of ammo restricted from the public. Any and all of these ideas might make a difference an MIGHT make America great again. Do something @realDonaldTrump
3330 2018-02-17 13:19:48 ..along with bans on accessories like extended clips, silencers, and bump stocks. You can keep your fixed clip simi auto AR15. You should have to reload after no more than 10 shots...although limiting to hunting rifles and revolvers like Uk would be a better option.
3331 2018-02-17 13:19:45 Sorry Mr Security, it's Congress that has to "do something"...don't worry, not a chance in hell that anything will happen!  Remember Bump Stocks!
3332 2018-02-17 13:19:06 Agreed - I'd recommend trying the cashew milk recipe if you can get cashews plastic free. There is the Plastic Free Pantry website which stocks them. They are based in Nottingham and appreciate that it's quite a way from you.
3333 2018-02-17 13:18:57 14-day waiting period 
No sales by private owners 
No sales at gun shows
10 round magazine limit 
No bump stocks or cranks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements 
Minimum purchase age of 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks 
Domestic violence ban
3334 2018-02-17 13:18:57 Did you have any Republicans vote against Banning bump stocks?
3335 2018-02-17 13:18:54 Yes there has to be a group of changes made. No single solution. The biggie is better gun checks as remember, almost all the recent shooters got legal guns (and legal purchase bump stocks for some). As u say military grade guns ONLY for military & L.E
3336 2018-02-17 13:18:23 Did you have any Republicans vote against Banning bump stocks?
3337 2018-02-17 13:17:55 If you Trumpanzees and Russian agents would only consider the massacres late term abortions, could we ban assault weapons and bumper stocks?
3338 2018-02-17 13:17:50 I've fired real machine guns, not an AR-15. Bump stocks can be made at home. And soon enough 3d printing will allow a lot of people to print their own guns.. Do you want a responsible and armed society before that time maybe?
3339 2018-02-17 13:17:49 Varney is shameless promoting stocks.  Who pays him???
3340 2018-02-17 13:17:38 But can they be modified w/ bump stocks? Honest question.
3341 2018-02-17 13:16:50 It’s gonna be a tidal wave come November. Women, millenials, people of color and anyone who was an immigrant. Will be a republican wipeout in state houses, the house & senate. Then maybe then we get bump stocks and assault rifles banned and have sanctions against our enemies
3342 2018-02-17 13:15:49 Yes there has to be a group of changes made. No single solution. The biggie is better gun checks as remember, almost all the recent shooters got legal guns (and legal purchase bump stocks for some). As u say military grade guns banned (no sensible civilian requirement to own)
3343 2018-02-17 13:15:45 Not true. This was successful in Australia.  We certainly can ban assault rifles and bumper stocks.  Our kids deserve this.
3344 2018-02-17 13:13:10 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your insomnia
3345 2018-02-17 13:13:10 TERRA PRIME GROUP stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
3346 2018-02-17 13:13:08 Wondering, does elliot wave work that well on "new" alt coins? I remember reading in that book you gave us that individual stocks are in general too volatile for elliot, it said we're better off finding the overall market trend to predict if stock is going up or down.
3347 2018-02-17 13:12:21 .@SenatorLankford we need to pass a ban on automatic weapons, bump stocks for a start, even better lets follow the example of Australia it worked.
3348 2018-02-17 13:11:54 Universal background checks 
End private sale
End sales at gunshows
Limit to 5 Rd mags
Ban bump stocks
Ban rifles with pistol grips
Ban recoil compensation springs/other devices. 

You can still have a shotgun for home defense and rifle for hunting. 

There, I solved it.
3349 2018-02-17 13:11:44 Start with this:
14 day wait period
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements
Minimum age of purchase at 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban
3350 2018-02-17 13:11:03 The agency also seized stocks of gold, diamond and other precious stones worth Rs 5100 crore. Soon Nirav Modi will be behind the Bars and congress will not get their hideout #CongressPNBscam
3351 2018-02-17 13:10:51 Many NRA members are FOR sensible/common sense guncontrol laws. For instance the bump stocks, mental health checks etc. I want to know where NRA millions are coming from. Its not membership. How much came from russian oligarchs for instance
3352 2018-02-17 13:10:46 So sick of his avoidance of leadership.  Taking assault rifles and bump stocks away  from people is not taking away the 2nd amendment rights.
3353 2018-02-17 13:10:24 If you're hell bent on the public having access to AR-15s + bump stocks, you're not a responsible gun owner. Meet in the middle and show that the safety of innocent people's lives is more important to you than masturbating on the constitution with weapons made for mass shootings.
3354 2018-02-17 13:09:48 A plan of actions is needed now!  Ban military style weapons, ban bump stocks, prevent individuals with criminal backgrounds from buying guns of any type, and reinstate the tougher gun laws for individuals with mental health issues!  When will we see a plan?
3355 2018-02-17 13:09:33 Your silence is deafening regarding the mass shooting in Florida. Please support universal background checks,  ban assault rifles including bump stocks, and support mental health issues.
3356 2018-02-17 13:09:33 @ConorLambPA I want my donation back! No new gun laws? UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS, NO ACCESS FOR MENTALLY ILL, TERRORIST WATCH LIST, NO BUMP STOCKS, LICENSES to name just a few.
3357 2018-02-17 13:09:03 Bought my first stocks last night.
3358 2018-02-17 13:08:35 If we start NOW, in 100 yrs, our children won't have to deal with this shit. HARSH punishment for being in possession of automatic weaponry. Buy Backs- TAX BULLETS-Shut down Gun Shows-Bump stocks, altering ANY gun, illegal. EVERY gun MUST be registered. Mental BACKGROUND CKS!
3359 2018-02-17 13:06:43 D ED seized stocks of gold, diamond and other precious stones worth Rs 5100 crore. Soon Nirav Modi will be behind the Bars & congress will not get their hideout #CongressPNBscam

3362 2018-02-17 13:05:28 When your being a douche, what do you expect?  So we can look back through all your posted stocks and every one of them did what you said and if not, you’re a liar and a pumper by your logic, correct?
3363 2018-02-17 13:04:00 Ok what about the Vegas shooter.  Appeared to b sane.  No one reported anything strange about him.    Multiple ARs tracer bullets bump stocks. Again these should b banned.  No other use than mass murders
3364 2018-02-17 13:03:34 and now American suppliers sell them with Bump stocks and suppressors which only make them more dangerous

Because that is what hunters and target shooters need!
3365 2018-02-17 13:02:01 14-day waiting period 
No sales by private owners 
No sales at gun shows
10 round magazine limit 
No bump stocks or cranks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements 
Minimum purchase age of 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks 
Domestic violence ban
3366 2018-02-17 13:01:51 Bad stocks are like eggs, good stocks are like tennis ball.... u all know what happens when both fall from a height
3367 2018-02-17 13:01:34 I can’t sleep in on weekends anymore. I’m officially old. 

Gonna trade stocks and drink craft beer later.
3368 2018-02-17 13:01:14 People who listen to videos on the train with the sound up should be put in the stocks.
3369 2018-02-17 13:00:45 It’s time for responsibility, actually long overdue. Responsible gun laws, no more extended clips and bump stocks. Money to take care of the mentality ill instead of allowing them to purchase weapons.
3370 2018-02-17 13:00:26 Well I never. For those who think the end of the world is nigh, we are open, and have a 2pc BOGOF on this weekend. While stocks last  x

3372 2018-02-17 12:59:16 Yes. Ban all assault weapons and bump stocks. Now. If not legislators are complicit in the deaths of our children and adults.
3373 2018-02-17 12:58:19 No Bump stocks!  No Automatic Rifles!  Mandatory background checks!  Waiting periods!  Protect our families!
3374 2018-02-17 12:57:00 Well, the weight goes down. So it doesn’t affect returns a lot. But stocks going up may keep going up for sometime. So Index works best as pseudo momentum investing. Read research papers on momentum investing
3375 2018-02-17 12:56:54 sigi ipagtitirik ko ng kandila mamaya yung joke.tapos hanap nadin akong stocks ng bakit para d ka maubusan.
3376 2018-02-17 12:55:06 Lmao... Najua mamen. Wacha wajinice while stocks last. 
3377 2018-02-17 12:53:25 Hint::Start with magazine capacity and bump stocks
3378 2018-02-17 12:50:21 A little amazing top sushi chefs fear the over fishing that's depleting fish stocks & reducing key ingredient availability.
Only a little.
3379 2018-02-17 12:50:02 The DJIA, what market numbers are based on, only consists of 30 stocks. 401Ks are invested in "funds", each made up of a variety of stocks that minimize risk. You don't own the stock you own the fund. When you sell, you sell your fund back to your investment firm, not the market.
3380 2018-02-17 12:48:28 We could start with getting rid of assault weapons & bump stocks. Maybe stricter background checks? 
I have to have a license to drive a car or show ID to vote or buy cold medicine. Why is that?
3381 2018-02-17 12:48:20 U.S. bank stocks rally, analysts see more upside
3382 2018-02-17 12:48:15 You don’t need to. Pass reasonable #gun laws - ban #assault rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks - close loop holes for straw man purchases - and you’ll save lives. That will be a good first step.
3383 2018-02-17 12:48:05 I could agree with the bump stocks but our right to own a fire arm shall not be infringed. What is a military grade weapon? They use pistols, shotguns, hunting rifles ( Snipers) and fully auto weapons which have already been banned.
3384 2018-02-17 12:45:43 An index fund is indeed a collection of stocks - they are usually done in order to track a market index such as the s & p 500 or ftse100
3385 2018-02-17 12:42:37 A musket. That can fire once or twice! That was our right to bare arms. NOT AN AR15 @NRA @VP @POTUS @SpeakerRyan nobody in this country needs to buy one or use an assault weapon as part of their 2nd amendment rights you morons. Let’s give them bump stocks too for good measure. 
3386 2018-02-17 12:42:08 How are traditional assets the safest bet? We live in the most volatile time in history and also it is such a pain to trade stocks and other financial instruments. Crypto is the answer to the maladies of the current system. You just need to do your homework before you invest.
3387 2018-02-17 12:41:19 7. Ban all semi auto weaponry and bump stocks.
3388 2018-02-17 12:41:19 Wow is right. What seems to be going on in the real world sure looks diff than what happened to stocks this week
3389 2018-02-17 12:41:07 That’s only the first of infinite choices to be made. The point of hiring any financial firm is to delegate that choice making. But alas, if it’s hard to choose stocks, it’s harder to choose stock managers.

3393 2018-02-17 12:39:45 Traditional savings are also the same.Even real estate properties go down in value, banks can go bankrupt and even stocks.But in cryptos for eg:1ETH=1 ETH,1BTC = 1BTC.Same like 1 house=1 house.We will be in a loss only if we sell at low price.Cryptos r just like any other market.

3402 2018-02-17 12:27:55 I admit it's grammarly poor and lacks in integrity, but it has no period, so the conclusion is not apart from the beginning. You can happily keep buying bump stocks and craft automatic ar15 and go school hunting anyway, It's not my business, I'm not American.
3403 2018-02-17 12:27:36 Get past deflections-opportunity for action:
Universal backgrnd checks for gun & ammunition 
14 day waiting periods
No sales by private owners or gun shows
No bump stocks, cranks, assault rifles
Min age of purchase-21 

What will YOU do? @RepDonBacon #GunContolNow #publichealth
3404 2018-02-17 12:27:35 Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and anything that holds more than ten bullets, pass universal background checks, expand mental health coverage for all, fully fund local, state and federal law enforcement, take domestic terrorism seriously & stop drawing fake lines to divide us.
3405 2018-02-17 12:26:35 Yet another reason to deal with winter in Massachusetts. We also banned bump stocks. You know like Congress was going to do after Vegas?

3413 2018-02-17 12:18:17 Clark, many MJ stocks are in the same boat from this perspective.  IMO maybe this will have a slight positive effect on the stock short term but it won't have staying power.  Once everything starts moving, $Lg will move forward or backwards with the herd. GL

3428 2018-02-17 12:03:59 Absolutely. There is also an international factor as eg developing economies/Far East money looks for safe ‘refuges’ around the world & avoids bank deposits & bonds (because of low real terms interest rates) & wary of over holding stocks. Hasn’t QE had big role in creating this?

3439 2018-02-17 12:00:36 You probably don’t need to fire a million rounds a minute with one of those bump stocks devices. You probably don’t need drums that hold 500 bullets. And you probably shouldn’t allow mentally ill people or people with a history of domestic abuse to have a gun.

3442 2018-02-17 11:58:33 Senator? Has it occurred to you that we don’t have to make it easy for our citizens to acquire AK 15’s or large magazines or bump stocks?
3443 2018-02-17 11:58:17 Assault weapon? The only assault weapon is a military fully automatic rifle. None have been used since Al Capone used Tommy guns. Even Vegas, semi-automatics with bumb stocks. Any normal hunting rifle can be fit with hi-capacity magazines and shot as fast as these idiots managed.
3444 2018-02-17 11:57:18 What are bump stocks
3445 2018-02-17 11:57:08 An AR 15 is a .223 caliber rifle. With scary lookijng stocks, sights and other accessories.  Thats it. 

Home defense, sport/target shooting, hunting. Of course it has a purpose.

Most gun crime and the worst school shooting is/was done with a handgun.

That's the reality.
3446 2018-02-17 11:56:21 The 2nd amendment does not mention bump stocks, or automatics weapons, assault rifles, high capacity magazine clips, and so on.  Having them is no one’s right.
3447 2018-02-17 11:54:20 “A-“ rating by the NRA. 
You accepted $21,000+ of their money
After Vegas you said you’d at least support banning bump-stocks, but nothing happened.
3448 2018-02-17 11:53:49 All highbita stocks..no use..for small investors
3449 2018-02-17 11:52:37 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan true- our proverbial leaders are either sitting on their hands, or like Nunes interfering! What an embarrassing group. And this doesn’t address AR15s, gun stocks etc to keep our kids safe!
3450 2018-02-17 11:51:04 I agree - but the context of this was why not ban bump stocks and AR-15's  (I even suggested AR-15 use exclusively at gun ranges)...there was no give
3451 2018-02-17 11:47:35 Heh Homeboy Sean.   Let's talk about guns and what your Knight in Shining Armor is going to do about it.  Let's focus on what the FBI missed and mental health. You missed the point.Start with no bump stocks, no military grade weapons and no large clips plus mental health issues.
3452 2018-02-17 11:47:08 BAN AR-15 assault rifles and bump stocks. Keep your handguns. You don’t need tactical rifles. Your hobby is not worth children’s lives. If it was your child, you would put down the fucking assault rifle.

3462 2018-02-17 11:37:28 It was meant for muskets and flintlock pistols in 1791 bro. It's 2018 the government isn't gonna come take what they want from your house. But we need to start somewhere. Bump stocks, drum mags , 30 round mags for AR 15  just to name a few. And I'm a gun owner before you blow up.
3463 2018-02-17 11:34:58 The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth over an extended period of time through the buying and holding of a portfolio of stocks, baskets of stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investment instruments.
3464 2018-02-17 11:34:48 I grew up in public schools. We didn't read the Bible or pray as part of the curriculum. There were no shootings simply because there were less guns and no AR-15's & bump stocks. There were always angry or crazy kids.
3465 2018-02-17 11:34:38 That's not how a bump stock works, but nice try. Bump stocks are most effective with pump actions.

3469 2018-02-17 11:30:20 We could say it's Not a gun issue until the cows come home...Liberals will still scream bump stocks, AR-15s, and "common sense gun legislation".
So, give them what they want - change a gun show law, get rid of the stocks & restrict AR-15 ownership. Does that fix or stop CRAZY?
3470 2018-02-17 11:29:48 Ça c'est parce qu'ils sont pas coaches par @AirsportFR  (tu crois qu'il va finir par nous filler quelques stocks options après toute la pub qu'on lui fait ?)
3471 2018-02-17 11:27:54 C’est sûr qu’il faut faire quelque chose mais même si demain il y avait une interdiction totale des armes et munitions, les stocks existants sont tellement énormes et le trafic illégal tellement organisé que ça empêcherait pas les plus tarés de s’armer.
3472 2018-02-17 11:26:29 Inflation and stocks can go other ways.
3473 2018-02-17 11:24:16 I haven't seen the blame appropriately placed yet. It should be on the shooter. Guns, bump stocks, and bullets didn't walk into a school and kill people. Nicolas Cruz did. Until you understand why, this debate remains in the same spot as last time.

3483 2018-02-17 11:03:11 Condolences are hollow words. To hope & pray won't stop an AR-15 from emptying a clip in 3 seconds. Why are gun owners rights to an AR-15 > my right to safety? Bump stocks? Nothing. Talk later? Talk NOW! We don't need another Hinkley Jr. to pass laws to make all humans safe NOW!
3484 2018-02-17 11:02:33 why not ban assault weapons.  enforce stricter background checks.  no bump stocks or cranks. see if it works.  if the murders decrease then we end the debate.
3485 2018-02-17 10:59:56 Stop the sale o f semi-automatic gun$, bump stocks to anyone only machines of war their only one purpose is to kill as many people as possible in the shortest time possible.

3489 2018-02-17 10:53:07 Anyone who disagrees with you is ignorant. Genius!!, I am not talking machine guns. Bump stocks and trigger activators etc  are fully legal and make semi automatic guns function like automatic.  I thought you knew about guns.
3490 2018-02-17 10:49:26 He is lying to you. 
What he says makes no sense. 
So if you ban bump stocks, that's 15 lives saved; if you enforce BG checks, that cuts out 1 mass shooting.
Why wouldn't you do that anyway??
Saving 10 lives is better than 0
3491 2018-02-17 10:43:18 All 3 stocks had their best run. Should atleast retest their 21 EMA levels to make bulls attract again. Rest mkt is supreme. (i.e. if take supports near: Heg 2200-2100, Graphite 630-620, Rain 340-330). Or a consolidation is also gud.

3555 2018-02-17 09:17:13 There appears - to an outsider - to be few processes that are designed to stop people with serious mental issues or criminal intent from having ready access to deadly assault weapons. I still see no legitimate reason for a private citizen to have assault weapons or “bump stocks”.

3566 2018-02-17 09:04:59 It’s a start, but until we ban bump stocks and semiautomatic weapons there will still be mass shootings. Listen to the kids from Parkland; they want gun laws!

3567 2018-02-17 09:03:40 It's not so interesting that some stock price fell 19.9% yesterday.

3575 2018-02-17 08:52:18 We need to ban assault weapons, universal background checks, federal database of all gun purchases, ban silencers, and bump stocks, ban mentally ill people and criminals from having guns. There are a lot of things we can do if the NRA wasn't bought by the gun manufacturers.

3631 2018-02-17 07:27:09 Off shore accounts, tax havens, land ownership... In practice, stocks (though they shouldn't), trusts. If money isn't used it's a burden on the economy. The rich weaken the economy, the poor build it.

3633 2018-02-17 07:22:57 Hunt stocks in retail..This will always be a big thing..Hope to get some good names
3634 2018-02-17 07:22:48 Those rifles dump a ton of rounds in semi auto mode, and can have large mags. I don’t think bump stocks should be legal for civilians, and I don’t see where the police could use it, but I’m sure not opposed to the law having them. Which makes the right FREAK out. LoL. 
3635 2018-02-17 07:21:35 I also know that banning bump stocks was all the rage following Las Vegas but GOPers felt it was too soon to talk policy. Just like Sandy Hook. It’s always too soon.
3636 2018-02-17 07:20:08 with the bitcoin's uphill trend bloomberg is all scared that investors might pull out from stocks and bonds and move to bitcoin and other blockchain currencies ....

3638 2018-02-17 07:18:39 It has never been about that! It is about taking away assault rifles and bump stocks! You do not want to have your party’s money taken away!

3641 2018-02-17 07:15:05 I would recommend how to make money in stocks by O’Neil . Great historical account of how technical analysis can be applied to equity trading.... not sure any of it applies to mad unbalanced crypto markets, but as books go, it’s about the best
3642 2018-02-17 07:13:53 There will be pre-order and ph go (non-attendees) 
There will be on site sale but limited stocks
3643 2018-02-17 07:12:55 I know you're right. Too many indicators showing how weak and overvalued the stock market is right now. 25% or more of the stocks were purchased on margin which will be the catalyst to the speed of the crash. I predict 20,233
3644 2018-02-17 07:12:49 Stocks are more trade restrictions on bananas than on AK-47s.
3645 2018-02-17 07:12:33 May hv charged u brokerage of Delivery which is around 2% than Intraday around 0.15-0.3% !
3646 2018-02-17 07:12:24 Why stop at auto? Why not include semi auto and bump stocks? Why is that suddenly *unreasonable"?
3647 2018-02-17 07:09:36 Nakakastress wala pa din stocks! Hahaha
3648 2018-02-17 07:09:27 Agreed. I grew up hunting and believe that people have a right to hunt and own guns for it. I was in Las Vegas the weekend of the shooting staying 4 seasons which is attached to Mandalay Bay. What an absolute nightmare. Bump Stocks, assault rifles. How many mass shootings with AR
3649 2018-02-17 07:07:36 Thanks for the compliment but I don’t think you understand how a bump stocks are used.

3652 2018-02-17 07:01:46 Ban assalt riffles, bump stocks and large magizines.  Require gun manufactures to devise way to tie every gun and every single bullet to the purchaser.  Ban the NRA from political contributions.  Allow CDC to study gun violence. How's that for satrters?
3653 2018-02-17 07:00:14 Well if "politicize" means legislate some common sense gun laws like background checks at gun fairs & sales btwn individuals, banning high capacity mags & bump stocks and AR-15s and NO concealed gun reciprocity, you are damn right, Ted Cruz. Now take your NRA blood money & leave.
3654 2018-02-17 06:59:11 Bump stocks have legitimate uses I’m sure, but for most purposes bump stocks for an AR-15 or similar are just fulfilling the desire of many to own a weapon as close as you can get to that of a soldier, without the military discipline, training and service that goes along with it.
3655 2018-02-17 06:59:08 ぼく今新宿駅着きました
3656 2018-02-17 06:58:29 あとでじっくりお話聞かせてもらうわよ

3658 2018-02-17 06:57:14 果たして会場までたどり着けるか
3659 2018-02-17 06:55:01 Right, the military already has access to all automatic guns they need, and more. They don’t use bump stocks because they already have something that does the same job more effectively & reliably.

It’d be like me using a hand trowel to dig a trench when I could use a shovel.
3660 2018-02-17 06:53:32 the future in stocks are---the technology!!! #AI #BlockChain you haven't even hear of the future of MJ stocks!!! this is nothing
3661 2018-02-17 06:53:07 Oui et c’était les stocks européens d’Amazon donc il n’y a plus rien sur le .fr aussi.
3662 2018-02-17 06:52:15 If I had the stomach for it (and/or the bankroll) I could probably do some damage in stocks given time.
3663 2018-02-17 06:52:11 Understood, but there should still be a ban on bump stocks to legislate the understanding that its unacceptable or unlawful to maneuver around manipulation or "loopholing" the law or other privileges. Just my thoughts!
3664 2018-02-17 06:51:03 RBI, government do heavy lifting, can banks get back in shape? #stocks #tips #bse
3665 2018-02-17 06:50:46 I do not support a ban. I am not anti-gun. I support gun law reform, specifically re: assault weapons, bump stocks, silencers, as well as reform to licensing, training, age, and mental health check requirements. I support legal/responsible gun ownership.
3666 2018-02-17 06:47:38 Some times it's better to avoid stocks which are trading at steep discount to there peers it may be a value trap best example is #GitanjaliGems .....many invested just coz it was trading at steep discount
3667 2018-02-17 06:47:35 But bump stocks you massive ignoranus
3668 2018-02-17 06:46:59 Senator- present a bill that will stop the sale of assault weapons or bump stocks to average Americans. Assault weapons are meant to kill as many people as possible in a matter of seconds. It is a weapon used in war not schools, movie theaters or concerts.
3669 2018-02-17 06:46:45 Almost everything on every site you listed. Read anything but creation literature and you will quickly find the sites you listed are laughing stocks for their articles and "theories".
3670 2018-02-17 06:46:43 Reality is that stocks are up, take home pay is up, unemployment is down, consumer confidence is up etc.
3671 2018-02-17 06:46:15 たのしみ
3672 2018-02-17 06:45:31 It upsets me that people think the AR is the reason but there are many guns without pistol stocks that can do way more damage. It's just a gun they see used on tv an games so much. Truth is the Texas shooter killing cops used a basic iv rifle stock. The Orlando shooter did not
3673 2018-02-17 06:43:09 Assault weapon, bump stocks ban are a beginning
3674 2018-02-17 06:42:36 ...and overkill weapons, aka assault rifles, bump stocks, were added to the 2nd Amendment as a right to bare arms...where is that written exactly?
3675 2018-02-17 06:42:16 So just tell me, why do you need rifles like the ones used in the school shootings and in Vegas?  Do you also advocate for bump stocks?
3676 2018-02-17 06:42:12 its good lesson,i did that when i started trading now i am in over 100 stocks and only 10%portpolio in pink and otc, just casino money
3677 2018-02-17 06:41:24 Pretty sure bump stocks were banned almost immediately after Vegas.
3678 2018-02-17 06:36:10 Sorry, that is absolutely not good enough. No one should be allowed to own AR-15's or the like or all the killing add-ons, like bump stocks.  If they want to shoot those, they should only be legal at a range.  #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #GunReformNow #GunRegulation
3679 2018-02-17 06:34:50 Since it wasn’t a hot topic, no one was looking at bumb stocks. They were meant to help handicap people. However, you really think you’re going to stop someone from modifying their gun? People will find ways if they want to.
But yes, they’re working on, if not already banned them
3680 2018-02-17 06:34:30 This whole stocks thing is actually working out. I'm getting shares and ETF's off of return now.
3681 2018-02-17 06:33:07 I totally agree. I'm still floored that bump stocks are still legal after Vegas. The inaction is sickening.

3683 2018-02-17 06:32:00 All the corruption is on the left? What? All of Trump’s original cabinet, save the VP, were forced out due to various wrongdoing. The whole Republican Congress refuses to ban bump stocks because they’ve been bought by the NRA. The list is very long.
3684 2018-02-17 06:31:58 Your point with regard to recruitment of a key defender though is right in Collingwood's case though. Key forward and key defence stocks are arguably the worst and thinnest in the league.
3685 2018-02-17 06:29:23 bump stocks are still legal.
3686 2018-02-17 06:27:04 DONT SELL ANY FOOKING SHOE ABOUT LBJ PLEASE U GUYS SO AMATEUR @KithSet @kith we cant buy, its bullshit, why? why these stocks ending in 5 min?

SPX closed +0.04%. SPX is +4.3% for the week & 5% away from the prev high. WTI +0.5% to $61.62. #DowJones #markets
3696 2018-02-17 06:21:03 1. I never claimed you said ban all guns(please read, your words not mine.) I’m questing your logic by asking, why not ban all guns? Why ban guns that statistically kill LESS people(AR-15.) 
Bump stocks are also being made illegal. Even the NRA agrees.
3697 2018-02-17 06:18:34 Millions of your voters say you can DO the RIGHT thing.Tell the NRA, Paul Ryan & Mitch McConnel we have to STOP the gun violence.We want expanded background checks, BAN assault rifles &bump stocks.This does NOT take guns away,it makes our country SAFER.95%of Americans agree.

3701 2018-02-17 06:14:38 No a ban means they would not have had the opportunity to purchase them from the get go. I think you give these animals far too much credit. Certain common modifications to turn the guns into similar weapons should also be gone such as bump stocks.
3702 2018-02-17 06:14:37 Thank God Nirav Modi didn't purchase stocks with the borrowed money.. else it would have been a stock market scam rather than a banking scam like in 1992 and 2000
3703 2018-02-17 06:14:32 No American citizen needs an AR15......ban the damn things along with bump stocks and the bullets!!!
3704 2018-02-17 06:12:55 As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.

3706 2018-02-17 06:07:18 Erasing it? No. Taking it from 18% to 12% isn’t erasing it. Your other stocks will do better. It frees up money in the economy to be spent in actual free markets. More sales for many other sectors.
3707 2018-02-17 06:05:24 What is even more curious about the American gun disease is: gun stocks always rise post mass shooting. It seems like everyone thinks the best way to reinforce their 'defense' is by buying more guns.

Weird society.
3708 2018-02-17 06:02:17 He can't. He is in the NRA's pocket. Also can't believe he thinks he is exonerated AGAIN. We need to ban all assault type weapons, bump stocks, mentally ill from buying(Trump F Up), or just ban them all - we must stop this plague.
3709 2018-02-17 06:01:47 Jesus, what an incredibly middle ages tweet. We should also put thieves in stocks in the village square and throw tomatoes at them
3710 2018-02-17 06:00:11 Magazine size? Bump stocks? Can be modified to full auto? Intent of the design? Bullshit.
3711 2018-02-17 05:59:38 1. Fair enough, whatever an AR-15 is, ban it and similar weapons, and bump stocks.
2. Democrats aren't in power, and cannot pass gun control laws. Republicans won't anyway, NRA owns them.
3. Your sentence abruptly stopped..did you cum?
3712 2018-02-17 05:57:00 Yes, ban them. Also ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
3713 2018-02-17 05:56:49 I cannot for the life of me figure out why we can’t:  1) ban AR-15s and weapons like them or accessories to create weapons like them (like bump stocks), 2) mandate record of private sales, 3) comprehensive background checks. That is not too much.
3714 2018-02-17 05:55:41 Hahaha they don’t care bruh, as long as they get rid of all stocks.
3715 2018-02-17 05:54:16 You mean like Obama did?
3716 2018-02-17 05:53:57 Nobody buys these stocks. The prices are shot down by the operators in circular trading & poor small investors get caught
3717 2018-02-17 05:53:57 We need to ban AR-15 guns, fast loads,  bump stocks because OUR LIVES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN GUNS.
3718 2018-02-17 05:51:40 AR 15's or other magazine type firearms and bump stocks should not be sold or allowed to be owned by the general public.  I can see our military and police officers having them. 

STOP SELLING THEM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

YOU ARE KILLING OUR CHILDREN.

3731 2018-02-17 05:43:19 There are many aspects that need to be improved upon. Access to mental healthcare, FBI following up on leads, improving communication, should re-introduce the mental health aspect to denying guns, gun reform regarding the age to own guns and ban bump stocks, etc

3733 2018-02-17 05:42:16 Maybe it’s just because I’m liberal, but “gun stocks up” doesn’t seem like a great trade for “daughter dead.”
3734 2018-02-17 05:41:41 Last February, you made it easier for people with mental illness to buy a gun. This February, 17 people died on Valentines Day. How about some positive progress on controlling the guns instead of easier access. How about banning bump stocks. How about outlawing guns like...

3758 2018-02-17 05:24:56 Buying on margin was the idea of borrowing money to buy stocks. This practice became popular during the late 1920s. Even when the stock market crashed the amount borrowed had to be paid back. #histry

3760 2018-02-17 05:24:21 It is actually legal for politicians to trade options and stocks ahead of votes on new legislation.  If a regular citizen like us did it, we would be arrested on insider trading charges.
3761 2018-02-17 05:22:57 Those 80+% ers:  background checks for everyone, close the gun show loophole. ban bump stocks, ban high capacity magazines, 3 day waiting period, adjucated mental health patients should not have a handgun. Those are all easy sensible laws that will pass over gun fetishists.
3762 2018-02-17 05:21:56 Pull out Mo na stocks mo bwahahahaha
3763 2018-02-17 05:20:28 How can u explain the benefits of crypto over stocks n commodities to #nocoiners in a single tweet?

Capped supply is what got me onto bitcoin... Only 21 million bitcoins so I had to have some

Then I learned about the never ending forks, hated it at first until it paid dividends
3764 2018-02-17 05:19:33 Stocks set for  best week in six years as dollar climbs...
3765 2018-02-17 05:18:54 To address gun violence I believe an approach must be comprehensive:
• Address mental health 
• Comprehensive background checks
• Increased family and community support
• Increased gun trafficking enforcement
• Ban high capacity mags and bump stocks
• Close access loopholes
3766 2018-02-17 05:18:48 Age has nothing to do with it. Look at the shooter in Las Vegas-he was way more than 21. Assualt weapons and bump stocks should be banned, period, no matter what the buyer's age is.
3767 2018-02-17 05:18:39 We already have very strenuous background checks that have to go through before anyone buys a gun and most people don’t have bump stocks if we ban the selling of some guns, people will still find a way to obtain them.
3768 2018-02-17 05:18:06 I wish I knew how to work stocks
3769 2018-02-17 05:17:48 But the something else will at least slow him/her down. Bump stocks have no place in civilian hands. Neither do Semi-automatics. They are both meant to kill large amounts of people in a short amount of time. So Dr Ablow, YES it is a GUN ISSUE.
3770 2018-02-17 05:17:25 Interesting read, thanks. 

So IF these weapons including bump stocks were banned or access limited drastically, more stringent mental health/background checks implemented and the gun show loophole closed, would we see a positive impact at all?
3771 2018-02-17 05:15:49 There is absolutely no reason anyone should have or need an assault weapon. The only reason for one is murder. If congress cannot pass legislation to ban these and bump stocks, weapons for murder...then we need to vote out those who enable these murders.
3772 2018-02-17 05:15:05 I'm utterly sure that the Giant slalom narrative distracts us all from the Stocks news.
3773 2018-02-17 05:14:19 The pure sickness of a tragedy like this is highlighted by the fact that after each mass shooting stocks of the NRA increase.
3774 2018-02-17 05:14:12 PARTIAL SOLUTION: NATIONWIDE SCHOOL WALK OUT on MARCH 1st-refuse to return until assault weapons & bump stocks are banned, until universal background checks are mandatory & people that should not   have access to weapons R denied. We must break cycle of deadly silence & inaction.
3775 2018-02-17 05:13:54 We have laws requiring background checks for gun purchases, but if youths are emotionally unbalanced, violent or have arrest records have CLOSED RECORDS, we have no way of preventing them from purchasing guns,semi-automatic weapons, multiple-round ammunition and bump-stocks.
3776 2018-02-17 05:13:49 What fronts?!?  Be more specific.  Tell me how as POTUS, you are going to make it safe for children in schools in America?!? Let’s start with a ban on semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks.
3777 2018-02-17 05:13:22 We never talked about bump stocks
3778 2018-02-17 05:13:21 You must own some really bad stocks if that statement is true.
3779 2018-02-17 05:13:18 The NRA is perhaps the most effective propaganda machine since the SS. They've managed to turn an issue regarding guns into people emphasizing whether a weapon is automatic or not..whether if an attachment like bump stocks are used or if it's an mental health issue.
3780 2018-02-17 05:12:53 The NRA supports the promotion of military style weaponry that serves no useful purpose. We are not talking hunting rifles and target guns. We are talking AR-15’s, bump stocks, triggers that turn semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic. And they promote violence. #NRA
3781 2018-02-17 05:12:27 Let's not forget that the Republicans voted to allow concealed weapons permits across state lines further complicating law enforcement. They also wouldn't do anything about bump stocks after Las Vegas.
3782 2018-02-17 05:11:41 And the best health check-up happens in hospital stocks....socio-commercial businesses find it difficult to find the right balance...
3783 2018-02-17 05:10:44 It's ironic how the last month I encourage people to invest in cryptocurrency and stocks, I try to feed them facts that makes it a good investment and they turn me down, and now they know how my money is worth, they've been finding ways to contact me for an investment

3787 2018-02-17 05:09:19 Deplete stocks of surplus??!? Guess they weren't surplus after all!!!
3788 2018-02-17 05:07:17 And extended to dangerous accessories like bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
3789 2018-02-17 05:04:59 It may be that a primary top in stocks will be caused by a jump in inflation or econ growth spiking the yield on 10s, causing corp bond fund redemptions that won't be honored due to illiquidity, and exacerbated by algo's that were created for a low-volatility regime...imo
3790 2018-02-17 05:00:37 @marcorubio will you introduce a bill to the senate that will ban semiautomatic weapons being sold to private citizens, as well as bump stocks?  Your constituents demand action!  Now!
3791 2018-02-17 04:59:53 This is called Stock Market,in just 15 days of time where 11400 looking very easy now 10500 is looking like mountain itself.Return like 50% need years to generate wealth and take only 15 days to wipe off at least 30-40% in many stocks.

3792 2018-02-17 04:59:38 Umm bump-stocks were okd on your watch  ?
3793 2018-02-17 04:58:39 I've been trading for about a year now.   Watching all these parabolic hype moves on the low priced stocks, RIOT, LBCC, HMNY...  I cant locate shares to short.  How did you do this starting out with a small account?  What broker did you find fulfilled your needs for shorting.

3796 2018-02-17 04:56:45 Here's something to think about:
You cannot talk about specific stocks to someone who randomly calls you if you are a SEBI Registered Investment Advisor; but if you are not then you can :-)
3797 2018-02-17 04:55:44 BAN AUTOMATIC AND SEMI AUTOMATIC AND BUMP STOCKS
3798 2018-02-17 04:54:57 And bump stocks!
3799 2018-02-17 04:54:08 adult things is getting excited when walmart stocks ur favorite fabric softener
3800 2018-02-17 04:53:52 Doesn't take care of the problem of bump stocks that are in these guns in the killing machines
3801 2018-02-17 04:53:07 So what are your takes on bump stocks and extended mags? As a hunter, I find they are completely useless for what I use my guns for...so why keep them around for the general public. Any thoughts...
3802 2018-02-17 04:53:00 If their records are closed, there is no ability to USE those records in a background check to prevent them from purchasing guns, semi-automatic weapons, multiple-round ammunition and bump-stocks.  For purposes of safety of the American people, we need to FIX this problem.
3803 2018-02-17 04:52:59 Perhaps I should have been clearer. I am angry that Amash and his ilk have done nothing to reduce gun violence. Bump stocks, etc. I do understand the reasoning regarding the mentally ill + guns EO.
3804 2018-02-17 04:52:19 Therefore, an organization that lobbied for a repeal of the assault weapons ban -which saved lives- against background checks, gun show sales, bump stocks and spreads fear - that's a sponsor of terrorism. That's the NRA.

3806 2018-02-17 04:52:00 That’s why I personally would advocate for a “reasonable rounds per minute” restriction

That way, bump stocks, gun model, cartridge size—all factored in

Since most people don’t get home invaded by a football squad, being able to fire 10-15 rpm should be enough. 90+ not so much
3807 2018-02-17 04:50:33 NO CIVILIAN can own machine gun/fully automatic-ONLY military
Bump Stocks r regulated
Doesn't matter-can make ANY gun auto IF want=CRIMINAL
3808 2018-02-17 04:49:13 I've Realized over 2 years of investing that you need to evolve your methods as the industry is evolving. Finding points of reference are key. Cross-Market companies are a perfect example. BLockChain venture capitalists stocks can pay off in 2 ways ICO selection & in stock market
3809 2018-02-17 04:48:36 Josh whom'st   to deep stocks !
3810 2018-02-17 04:48:24 We have universal background checks, the gun show loophole I don't know a lot about so I can't give a informed opinion, you'll never be able to ban assault rifles w/o re-writing the 2nd amendment & risking civil war, bump stocks are not as big of a threat as you've been told,
3811 2018-02-17 04:47:38 Then the logical thing to do is ban bump stocks which BTW 45 has presented a bill to make it legal for ANYONE to purchase. He is an accomplice to murder if not deemed a murderer himself along with the @GOP and govt controlling  @NRA
3812 2018-02-17 04:47:26 actually everyone does....just buy the SP index...its not rocket science....i can get out of my stocks in minutes.....house may take years....its a liquidity argument more than anything else
3813 2018-02-17 04:47:19 Bump stocks are legal
3814 2018-02-17 04:46:58 For what purpose do peaceful gun owners need assault-style weapons, bump stocks, or large capacity magazines?  How is that honoring the sanctity of human life?

3816 2018-02-17 04:45:58 The lefties want to ban adjustable stocks but those are safer.  They adjust for better fit between, for ex, a husband and wife or child shooting the same gun.  Or for one shooter wearing light clothing or a heavy coat.
3817 2018-02-17 04:44:39 Is there a way to invest in US stocks directly?

3822 2018-02-17 04:42:35 Nobody should have automatic weapons. That being said.... AR15’s are not automatic lol. Hell, bump stocks should even be banned.
3823 2018-02-17 04:42:31 I worry that we have basically become like locusts, those crop devastating ones, in that we only consume and we are literally trading our health/us, as stocks. I basically think we have an unhealthy relationship with capitalism...

Assault rifles tbullets and bump stocks must be reclassified for military and swat use only. Make them ILLEGAL

Take NRA money 

Sponsor pro-gun legislation (silencers, guns on campus, reciprocity)

Do NOT sponsor gun-control legislation (bump stocks, AR15, closing loopholes)

3837 2018-02-17 04:33:09 Did we ever do anything about bump stocks, or find out what the Vegas shooters motive was? Fucking anything? ANYTHING? No. This will not be any different. Nothing will change. A Republican Congress is a JOKE.

3839 2018-02-17 04:32:47 1. Universal background checks. 2. Ban gun show loophole. 3. Allow the CDC to study gun deaths. 4. Ban “assault weapons” (return to prior ban). 5. Ban bump stocks. 6. Limit how much can be spent during a campaign to lessen the influence on money in politics. 7. TBD. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3840 2018-02-17 04:32:31 It's simple raise the age in which people can by rifles. Ban bump stocks, ban high capacity magazines. And everyone who has a gun should have a license to have that gun. Not just conceal carry
3841 2018-02-17 04:32:05 But I will say if there were to be a ban on bump stocks, I wouldn’t object.
3842 2018-02-17 04:32:02 One of the best lessons I learned trading stocks and options is to look at numerous time frames.
Minutes, hours, days, weeks, years.
The same applies with cryptocurrency. 

#trading #crypto
#stocks #options
3843 2018-02-17 04:30:33 Bump stocks can be easily made though by anyone and you can also use your belt loop to create the same effect. But even if the Vegas shooter didn’t have a bump stock, hard to say if it would have made a difference as the bump fire technique can actually make you less accurate.
3844 2018-02-17 04:30:21 GET OVER IT SARA!MY GOD!YOUR WHOLE WORLD DEPENDS ON THIS!WE DONT CARE!THE MEDIA DOES!WE CARE ABOUT JOBS,ECONOMY,STOCKS!YOURE the one whos obsessed!WE DONT CARE SARA!!
3845 2018-02-17 04:30:08 They are simply generating value for the shareholders. I have worked very hard and have most of my retirement in stocks. I have been investing for 20 years. Talk about things that really matter, like your lucrative government pensions you voted on yourselves, Chirp, Chirp, chirp.
3846 2018-02-17 04:30:04 I have not heard anyone on Wall st say what is going on is normal. We've had protracted times where stocks and bonds and gold and the dollar are all going down. This is totally uncharted territory. Every major analyst has come out and said the market has had a fundamental change
3847 2018-02-17 04:29:59 Is it stocks
3848 2018-02-17 04:28:42 Did you apologize to him for your lack of ANY action beyond thoughts & prayers to put any limit on guns/bullets/magazines/bump stocks as you are the NRA's 2nd biggest whore? $3.3m paid to you by the NRA to take no actions all to the harm of Floridians. Wasnt Pulse enough?
3849 2018-02-17 04:28:02 a salvo is a stocks: gentle-hearted and sheaved
3850 2018-02-17 04:27:32 I’m just trying to have discussion is all. Most people would pick the one on top because it looks like a military rifle when in reality these two guns are the exact same. Bump stocks were not even known until that guy used them but that’s as good a place as any to start
3851 2018-02-17 04:27:09 You can buy all the parts and build it yourself, customize for your own needs.  Lower receiver: buy with or without the trigger so you can customize the trigger. pick from a variety of stocks, solid, adjustable, etc.  Upper receiver:  with or without forward assist.
3852 2018-02-17 04:27:04 When Al Capone's Valentine's Day massacre happened the Congress eventually banned average citizens from owning fully automatic guns. Now gop led Congress can't even ban bump stocks which are damn close to full auto and are actively going backwards regarding mentally ill people.
3853 2018-02-17 04:26:54 It will certainly not prevent all, probably won't prevent most. But will prevent some. Should this kid, given his background, be able to purchase this AR-15 and go to gun school? 19yrs old? What animal does an AR-15 kill? Why do AR-15 stocks go up after killings like this?
3854 2018-02-17 04:24:54 Well another crazy week in markets behind us.. stocks made up a lot of damage and have come back close to the highs..economic data and earnings continue to support the bull market narrative... new all time highs next week??  I think so
3855 2018-02-17 04:23:39 I think a great launching point would be preventing bump stocks, which was the tool that allowed the Vegas shooter to injure around 500 human beings. I’m not here to argue caliber or guns that look scary, man. If you feel targeted that’s on you. Not me.
3856 2018-02-17 04:22:52 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
3857 2018-02-17 04:22:26 As long as there is a 2nd Amendment 2 the Constitution, there will b a gun problem, & thus a public health problem. We need 2 ban assault weapons again (like 1994-2004). Ban bump stocks & large-capacity magazines. Pay bunches of money to get people to turn them in. #guncontrol
3858 2018-02-17 04:22:20 This made me cry because I don’t have any answers and so little hope about gun control. I believe in the 2nd amendment, but assault rifles, bump stocks and less or no background checks is wrong.

3862 2018-02-17 04:18:43 One another Question sir. Till now I have back tested on 10 stocks out of that in 8 Stocks strategy work good but in BAJAJ AUTO it is not working & In BPCL it is breakeven. so is it possible that some strategy don't work on specific stocks because of their volatility.?
3863 2018-02-17 04:18:41 When did Republicans try to ban Bump stocks? Not being funny - I just do not remember anyone doing anything about it.
3864 2018-02-17 04:18:36 If you like to dabble in the stock market may I suggest mattress stocks as we're about to see a massive soiling event.
3865 2018-02-17 04:18:10 The start is banning the assault rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. After that, it is confiscation and destruction. And that still won’t solve it. But it is a start....that will not involve the 300 million guns problem.
3866 2018-02-17 04:16:14 The dollar rose and stocks around the globe rallied for a sixth straight session on Friday to post their best week in more than two years, but a U.S. indictment over alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election cooled gains on Wall Street.
3867 2018-02-17 04:15:22 Thank You Sir , 
1) I Don't have data of hourly chart prior to 2012 so is it sufficient or i should buy data from 2008 ? 

2) I am back testing on all FNO Stocks so all sector will be covered

3)Will surely Consider 20% Slippage. 

4) I am using tick bytick format for backtesting
3868 2018-02-17 04:14:55 I am very troubled by the epidemic of violence in this country. I support reinstating the assault weapons ban, closing the gun show loophole, and banning bump stocks. We have too many guns on the streets. I support gun buyback programs.

More interesting would be to know  who buys these stocks on such days and what is their bet?
3873 2018-02-17 04:13:12 Very nice show and stocks
3874 2018-02-17 04:12:22 So ban both. What's the issue? Ban bump stocks, too. No legitimate reason to own them
3875 2018-02-17 04:12:05 Well, if a 12 gauge will do the job, what do you need with all your AR-15s. (And I figure you to be someone with several, complete with bump stocks).
3876 2018-02-17 04:11:12 Another thing that would help is outlawing large capacity magazines. During the last ban magazines could only hold no more than 10 bullets. No bump stocks and some way to ck mental health background of purchaser

3880 2018-02-17 04:08:40 What the hell are bump stocks?
3881 2018-02-17 04:08:29 No I haven't, but bump stocks aren't full auto and have a tendency to cause a failure in the bolt cycling rendering the gun unusable.
3882 2018-02-17 04:08:28 So pass a gun law. Here I’ll give you one. Not even a gun law. Ban bump stocks. I dare you to follow through Senator.
3883 2018-02-17 04:08:25 If you have a 401k or trade stocks. You can buy GBTC. It is a bitcoin fund. Goes up and down with the price of Bitcoin. 1 share is about $19. It had gone up 30% this week.
3884 2018-02-17 04:08:01 @GovMattMead Please do something. Take the lead. Ban bump stocks. Require stricter background checks. I don’t care. Just do something.

Prophet Obama had a super majority his first 2 years & did NOTHING. His Admin authorized "bump stocks"..used N Vegas

Chicago has most gun control of any city & MOST KILLINGS

3887 2018-02-17 04:04:50 @get_chefd looking forward to making the chicken pad thai I picked up at my local @Target on Nicollet Mall! I’m especially happy because it’s dairy free! I’m allergic to milk and I LOVE that Target stocks meal kits, but there are a lot with dairy (there’s hacks for that, tho!)
3888 2018-02-17 04:04:11 But the kid in Fl killed 17, not 50. It would be easy to kill 17 with a regular hunting rifle. Yet bump stocks are legal to sell, but illegal to attach to a rifle. Maybe controlling gun accessories as apposed to the guns themselves.
3889 2018-02-17 04:03:37 I’ve got 3% of all my future paychecks going into Marriott stocks, let the games begin 
3890 2018-02-17 04:03:04 Ban the guns. Ban the ammo. Ban bump stocks. Require background checks & trace sale of ALL guns purchased ANYWHERE. Require training, testing & licensing of owners. Disallow guns for mentally unstable, convicted felons, abusers. #NeverAgain
3891 2018-02-17 04:00:09 Okay - it's the bump stocks that can turn these into machine guns. At minimum, the bump stocks AND machine guns should be banned. We're not gun owners. We don't need to know one gun from another so much as we need to know which guns and modifications can create these 1/2
3892 2018-02-17 03:59:37 Sold out na po tayo sa Stray Kids album. Thank you! Post ko na lang pag meron ulit stocks
3893 2018-02-17 03:58:35 Semantics. With the lack of movement on bump stocks, they might as well be.

The problem is the high cap magazines. Limit magazine size to maximum 5 cartridges. Ban any device that aids or modifies the firing action. There are MANY options, but you just scream 2nd Amendment!
3894 2018-02-17 03:57:48 @jimcramer didn't get a chance to catch mad money tonight! Any thoughts on the steel and aluminum stocks? $AKS
3895 2018-02-17 03:57:19 Gun owners are more worried about limits to buying any weapon they want than restrictions to purchasing. We've seen that with assault weapons, bump stocks, trigger locks, No Fly list, and mental illness.
3896 2018-02-17 03:57:06 Wrong.
Instead, demand that the FBI start doing it's job rather than watching porn and texting about the horrors of electing Donald Trump. If they had better utilized government time and government resources people might still be alive.
Bump stocks are the least of our worries.
3897 2018-02-17 03:57:02 If he was in stocks he would be up much more.
3898 2018-02-17 03:54:32 Be better off selling the stocks in 401ks and holding that money in cash in 401k account.If enough people do it, can all buy back cheaper

3900 2018-02-17 03:52:29 No there are not. That's a myth the NRA or somebody is feeding you all so that no laws get passed at all. Who are these people in the liberal movement? And if they don't even have enough influence to get bump stocks banned, what are you afraid of? Let's pass the laws already.
3901 2018-02-17 03:52:04 Kind of like the quick response to bump stocks
3902 2018-02-17 03:51:31 Interesting, you think it should be easy for mentally ill people or teenagers to get semi automatic weapons? Do you think it should be easy for them to get bump stocks?
3903 2018-02-17 03:50:27 The reason you don’t “see armies around the work using bump stocks” is because that a cheap ass way of making something fire quickly, without maintaining accuracy, and having crap reliability.  Compared to some simple mechanical changes inside that don’t hinder.  Duuuuuurp...
3904 2018-02-17 03:49:40 Millenium on 2017-12 sold 70000 $AFMD stocks. probably listened to @LEERINK and in new filling today they have 2,530,729 brand new $AFMD shares!!! #kosher from Israel Englander

3907 2018-02-17 03:48:49 Nobody needs to buy stocks, or have a lambo
The "no need" reason is lame
3908 2018-02-17 03:47:54 Oops, I forgot about your stocks. Sorry, Honey. Hate to be the bearer of bad news. 
3909 2018-02-17 03:47:54 No, people do not hunt with AR’s. Further, if you replace the assault rifle in ANY of the mass shootings with a hunting rifle, the casualties are GREATLY reduced. Ban assault rifles/bump stocks/high capacity magazines and put common sense back into schools and that’s a good start
3910 2018-02-17 03:46:54 Demolishing the school doesn’t change the fact that republicans will not support any reasonable changes to gun laws including outlawing bump stocks, as it continues to kiss the NRA ass for more blood money. They want it demolished so they don’t have to see it and hope we forget.
3911 2018-02-17 03:45:40 There are better stocks which will give more stable firing positions than the first one, the IA should give serious thought to optics and accessories, especially to troops in COIN ops without any further delay
3912 2018-02-17 03:45:12 Nobody wants to infringe on the 2nd Amendment.  But the AR15 used to be banned.  No one needs a 30 round mag, not for your house, not for hunting.  They didn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas.  They said they would.  Who needs a bump stock?
3913 2018-02-17 03:44:30 What if you told him that your relationship & his 'stocks age at the same rate? 
3914 2018-02-17 03:44:04 The Constitution is a living document, meant to change as the needs of the people change. When it was written they were using muskets which took 2 minuets to reload, not AK47’s. We need to at least ban semi automatic weapons and bump stocks.
3915 2018-02-17 03:43:38 Absofreakinglutely!! No one NEEDS an AR 15!! No one needs bump stocks. My husband is a hunter and gun owner and even he knows this. "They are fun to shoot". Go rent/check one out at shooting range and have your fun there. Civilians do not need these kinds of weapons. 
Thank you!
3916 2018-02-17 03:42:51 Fast forward to 19, trading those same stocks before games in our locker room. Starting the vending gig. Guys a winner! 
3917 2018-02-17 03:41:01 Weren't they going to do something about bump stocks after Vegas shooting too
3918 2018-02-17 03:40:51 This is not effective. Most teens I know have a fake ID to use in bars and they will use it to buy their assault weapon. We need to ban these weapons and their ammo clips, bump stocks and other conversion mechanisms. Not enough to raise age. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #GunControlNow

3928 2018-02-17 03:34:22 People started using drugs, we made stricter laws, people drive drunk, we make tougher DUI laws. Why the hell cant we have stronger penalties and bring back the ban on certain guns  and bump-stocks to start?

3935 2018-02-17 03:31:57 Why can't we work on mental health AND common sense gun laws (background checks, banning bump stocks, limiting access to military guns)?

These aren't exclusive.
3936 2018-02-17 03:31:20 YES ABSOLUTELY BAN ASSAULT RIFLES AND BUMP STOCKS!!!!

3938 2018-02-17 03:31:08 PTR 91 with the wood stocks & surplus Hensold claw mount scope is a sweet package. Had much success on Hogs, deer & goats with one. Just remember to chamber a round ( loud) before you go out. Heavy but balances well.
3939 2018-02-17 03:30:57 great share and read a ton of times, randomly back tested vs fang stocks, rules don't hold up as well, could just be my limited sample size, in ur experience do these rel val rules work better for low float/small caps or apply to all stocks?

3941 2018-02-17 03:29:49 I’m a teacher. No, it is not time for more guns. It’s time to ban military grade weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. It’s time to get rid of high stakes tests and put art, music, home economics and wood shop (common sense) back in.
3942 2018-02-17 03:29:34 Nadungagan naman hinuon akong ka kompetensya sa stocks nge. Edi wow di ko magpapilde oyy abi palang weaksht
3943 2018-02-17 03:29:03 Agreed on the bump stocks & the fully automatic military-style assault weapons. Also, I tend to agree with your stance on semi-automatic guns.
3944 2018-02-17 03:28:41 I know these are talking points. And they need to be addressed. But most of these are already in place. 

1. Gun Shows "SHOULD" be eliminated.
2. No Sale by private owner without a background check. (Paid by the seller)
3. Bump Stocks are new...
4. The AR-15 is a RIFLE!

3946 2018-02-17 03:27:34 what happened to getting rid of bump stocks?
3947 2018-02-17 03:26:02 I’m all ears on “common sense legislation”. Bump stocks for starters. But yes, instead of drugging our young people let’s counsel them and give them the help they need. Giving them a pill doesn’t cure a problem it only masks a problem.
3948 2018-02-17 03:23:06 My 78 yr old father, international hunter, owner of countless hunting guns-he literally doesn’t know how many guns he has-this AM on the phone: No pistols, no automatic weapons, no guns under 21, no bump stocks, limits on ammo. We are mad as hell. #FloridaShooting #NRAKills
3949 2018-02-17 03:22:51 First step. Ban all assault weapons, bump stocks, silencers. No need for anyone to own these. They are not what the second amendment was about. The fact that there are more guns than people in the U.S. is totally assinine. Gun manufacturers have literally gotten away with murder.
3950 2018-02-17 03:22:51 I'm lucky that i can pick stocks. If were forced to buy a MF it would be extremely challenging as no fund manager has any published philosophy to pick stocks for his/her fund!
3951 2018-02-17 03:22:31 The real threat are assault rifles. The lenient laws, the easy access, no background checks, silencers, bump stocks.
Your conspiracy theories are to take the blame away from those who deserve it.
The GOP bribed by NRA.
Wake up & see reality.
Could be your child next.
3952 2018-02-17 03:22:04 Its like chewing gum and walking, we MUST focus on more than one aspect of the issue at a time to keep up with the corporate gun lobby. Otherwise we’re always two steps behind. Silencers, bump stocks, concealed carry, NRA taking Russian money for Trump campaign. background checks
3953 2018-02-17 03:20:39 I don't know about 10-20 yrs. I'm thinking this year. If not crash of petro dollar will be results of shaky central banks & their shrinking the balance sheets,raising credit,less corp buy backs of stocks.

3959 2018-02-17 03:12:14 Yes Kyle, we know this. The question is still “why not ban assault weapons [used as a generic name encompassing assault rifles, AR-15s, accessories that turn a gun into a semi-automatic weapon, bump stocks]?” You understand the intent of the question.
3960 2018-02-17 03:11:52 Really no different than OTC stocks
3961 2018-02-17 03:11:47 Don’t be so sure of that - We do own a child development center. The only teaching job with stocks lol

3964 2018-02-17 03:10:20 @UnfilteredSE  Canada has some sensible gun laws.  Gun magazines are limited to 10 rounds.  You can't buy ammunition without a National permit.  You have to take training to get the permit. You can buy an AR 15 but they are not in the hands of the mentally ill.  No bump stocks.
3965 2018-02-17 03:09:09 @DebbieLesko What is your stance on semi automatic rifles and bump stocks?
3966 2018-02-17 03:08:59 I agree with your suggested solutions. Australia (where I’m from) doesn’t ban guns but we have tight regulations including background checks, no instant purchase, no assault rifles, bump stocks, machine guns or nukes
3967 2018-02-17 03:08:19 The 2nd amendment doesn’t guarantee anyone the right to have semi automatic firearms or bump stocks. We owe it to the children to keep them safe from a madman with a gun
3968 2018-02-17 03:07:52 Does it even fucking matter? What about the Vegas shooting that WAS an assault rifle with a bump stock? Assault rifles and bump stocks period don't belong in the hands of civilians. They're only purpose is for killing people.

3974 2018-02-17 03:04:59 It's not, if you and I agree no AR-15's for regulars and no bump stocks. It's a voting issue. The majority of us want gun control laws improved. Right now, there's no political will to do it. But there will be. Tipping point is here/coming.

3977 2018-02-17 03:03:32 I hope the plummeting stocks hit the pharmaceutical companies were it hurts.They have been bleeding Americans dry for decades,  as they make billions. They deserve what they get. It would be icing on a very delicious cake.
3978 2018-02-17 03:03:13 Limiting them would be perfectly fine.  I think any loopholes should be closed and I don't think regular people need AR-15's and bump stocks.  It's just tough to come up with a solution both sides will agree on.
3979 2018-02-17 03:02:31 Penny Stocks
3980 2018-02-17 03:02:28 Access to bump stocks, magazine sizes & rapid fire semi-automatic guns should be restricted. Furthermore, we also need to effectively enforce our current gun laws.
3981 2018-02-17 03:02:04 In Mar 2000, Naz dropped 9.2% in 3 days on a closing basis. On an intraday basis, it fell 13% during five days, so some of us have seen this picture before. #stocks
3982 2018-02-17 03:01:35 Anyway the Second Amendment doesn't say as much as a lot of people seem to think it does. Even if you think it means the right to bear arms militia or not, it doesn't say which arms. It doesn't say semi-automatics, high capacity magazines, bump stocks.
3983 2018-02-17 03:00:39 Some states still allow bump stocks. Massachusetts just made them illegal

3991 2018-02-17 02:58:03 Yes! And universal background checks, elimination of high capacity ammo, ban bump stocks and renew the regulation flagging people with mental illnesses from buying guns.
3992 2018-02-17 02:57:46 No need for the general public to have access to bump stocks either. 

Just a thought,  but if you can't drink a beer legally should you be able to buy a gun that can blow through a wall? (Yes I know guns are also obtained illegally)
3993 2018-02-17 02:57:25 Law abiding citizens!  Many of these mass murderers are law abiding citizens until they grab an AR 15 and decide to kill a bunch of people. That’s the issue moron.  We have to prevent ppl from getting their hands on these guns.  Ban semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks for starters
3994 2018-02-17 02:57:15 Add Universal background checks, nationwide registration, a ban on the sale of bump stocks and AR-15's.
3995 2018-02-17 02:57:14 Melhora o estilo da fonte, tenta usar mais stocks e até grunges no fundo, veja algumas referências para se inspirar. Porém, se inspire, não copie.
3996 2018-02-17 02:57:02 Make the ban apply to all currently owned guns, with stiff penalties for not participating in the buy-back program. There is no sporting need for bump stocks, high-capacity mags or assault rifles. None. Make it a crime for civilians to possess them.
3997 2018-02-17 02:57:02 You can either flip sacks or stocks. One could get you locked away an one could set you free...or potentially in debt if you dont play smart.
3998 2018-02-17 02:56:34 NRA doesn’t offer “thoughts and prayers”. Worst mass shooting in history happened last year and they stayed silent. Guns stocks went up. That made them happy. More money in their pockets. They need to be shut down. #FloridaShooting #GunReformNow #Parkland #BanAssaultWeapons
3999 2018-02-17 02:56:22 You want thoughts?  Here's a few:  bump stocks, assault weapons designed for war, cop killer jacketed bullets, 60 shot magazines, and no blue papering now allowed for people with psychosis get our kids killed. Gun restrictions NOW
4000 2018-02-17 02:55:18 Uranium One? That shit has got more holes in it than a fine piece of swiss cheese.  People should be buying stocks in aluminium/tin foil for you guys and your hats.
4001 2018-02-17 02:55:07 I think these are some reform measures we can all agree on. (Assuming you have common sense) 

Ban of automatic/semi-automatic weapons

Ban of things like silencers and bump stocks 

A background check, safety training, and a reason for buying the weapon.
4002 2018-02-17 02:54:56 I had real stocks n went to reps
4003 2018-02-17 02:54:54 Massachusetts just made bump@stocks illegal. Those make it so you can pull@the trigger a little quicker than naturally
4004 2018-02-17 02:52:53 Making some big moves so far 2018 with sales,stocks, and crypto! The come up has been real so far and it’s just going to keep going up
4005 2018-02-17 02:52:53 This is a start. Need background checks for all, no assault rifles, no bump stocks.
4006 2018-02-17 02:52:47 Proclamations are all for visual effect. They have no impact. 
You and Congress need to do something real!
- Ban assault weapons
- Stop gun sales at gun shows
- Ban bump stocks
- Have the FBI follow up on leads ( which they often fail to do)
4007 2018-02-17 02:52:26 Absolutely! Weapons of war should not be on our streets. Also need to look at limiting ammo purchases. Bump stocks and silencers need to be regulated.
4008 2018-02-17 02:51:57 Since I was so rudely ignored amongst all the other nonsense arguments and am pretty good about ignoring Bayo goonery without muting my whole ass timeline, I'll say it again: 

3 stocks?!
4009 2018-02-17 02:50:34 I've had my finger on the trigger to short this for a long time. I generally don't short stocks, but.. well, you know.
4010 2018-02-17 02:49:59 My students are really enjoying the game. Everyday they check their stocks without me guiding them. They are excited about investing!!!!
4011 2018-02-17 02:49:08 Now someone educate me: I see these reports of different mods and whatnot. Whats the story there? Is that a nonstarter or is there something to be said? Ie the popular topic: bump stocks.
4012 2018-02-17 02:48:14 Reinstate the Ban on assault weapons. Also ban bump stocks and high volume magazines. 1994-2004 assault weapons were banned. We were still Americans and hunters could still hunt. Still had ability to protect your home
4013 2018-02-17 02:46:06 Most of those are yesses for me, but banning big magazines and bump stocks are kinda useless, in context
4014 2018-02-17 02:45:35 I want everything this illegitimate orange scrotum has done to be equally illegitimate & reversed including Gorsuch!
The day he's out just imagine how drastically the pharmaceutical stocks will plummet that sell tranquilizers & antidepressants. Oooof, sell now!
4015 2018-02-17 02:45:20 It's been only four and a half months since historic #LasVegasShooting, and hardworking GOP sycophants are already still impeding embargoes on bump-stocks, big gun no-nos, and improved background checks.

#GOPLegacy Is #ActingLikeWeArentMonsters
4016 2018-02-17 02:43:58 Only marginal value to stocks that are already public... but huge value to small companies - & fractional ownership of real estate - & securitization of accounts receivable - &&&
4017 2018-02-17 02:43:49 Close the background check loopholes and don't let the issue of bump-stocks fall off your radar.  
(Also silencers are not safety devices.)
4018 2018-02-17 02:43:43 You’re so right. great Christian conservative republican logic! It’s just impossible 2 fix! No way banning assault weapons & ak’s wld help at all or raising the age of legality or the number of bullets n magazines or banning bump stocks or more stringent background checks —1/
4019 2018-02-17 02:41:24 I think you'll see change in 2018 when the House and Senate flip blue. I mean, after Vegas the house could not even summon the ability to ban bump stocks. Come on. Who the FUCK needs those?! It's money and politics but under it- like abortion- it's tribal divide.
4020 2018-02-17 02:40:47 I want everything this illegitimate orange scrotum has done to be equally illegitimate & reversed including Gorsuch!
The day he's out just imagine how drastically the pharmaceutical stocks will plummet that sell tranquilizers & antidepressants. Oooof, sell now!

4023 2018-02-17 02:39:39 their members paid to buy Congressional votes. Their members paid into campaigns for 'guns everywhere'.  Their members paid to lobby for concealed carry reciprocity. They paid for AR legalization, for gun show loopholes and paid for a look the other way on bump stocks. Fuck. You.
4024 2018-02-17 02:39:25 Bump stocks change that entirely, don’t be disingenuous
4025 2018-02-17 02:39:16 Don't need bump stocks, don't need high capacity magazines, don't need guns in the hands of mentally ill. The last of which was changed last year by GOP.
4026 2018-02-17 02:38:42 i'm talking about stocks
4027 2018-02-17 02:38:22 Every voter from first time teen to seasoned adult needs to oppose any politician who will not support common sense gun control: ban high capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks. #litmustest
4028 2018-02-17 02:37:33 Glad you survived, sad you so stupid.
We already HAVE over 26,000 gun laws!
Murder is already illegal.
And the fact is, you have ZERO knowledge of bump stocks, silencers or ANYTHING gun related.
We have had these SAME type guns for over 100 years, but no school shootings till now
4029 2018-02-17 02:37:20 If he planned on killing himself it would have been done before the police arrested him.
He is a coward. Who committed a cowardly deed. 
He should be stoned.
Drawn and quartered.
Placed in stocks til the birds have at him.
4030 2018-02-17 02:34:58 They sell bump stocks like the Vegas shooter used legally in many gun shops....And most semi automatic weapon can become fully automatic by filing firing pin. How is that not considered "easy"?
4031 2018-02-17 02:34:34 nice, it’s all about making money on shitty stocks not actually investing in them.
4032 2018-02-17 02:32:54 My portfolio is made up of
 dividend stocks
 cash
 margin for trading 
 cryptocurrency

The last one is a tactical, strategic and the most exciting asset of all in 2018
4033 2018-02-17 02:32:42 @Parianas @_machiparu_ @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
4034 2018-02-17 02:31:55 The way mental  illness is handled in this country is horrible and it needs to be in the forefront, a ban on assault riffles and bump stocks for the public would make a huge difference. Unfortunately money rules everything in this country over people lives.
4035 2018-02-17 02:31:23 Stocks and cryptos are riding the roller coaster together!
4036 2018-02-17 02:31:14 Why must these hedge fund tycoons get cute and try and be contrarian. We are in a global boom stocks will do very well enjoy it because it won’t last forever. Seize the day!
4037 2018-02-17 02:30:24 I want him in Stocks in Central Park where I can piss on him every day.
4038 2018-02-17 02:29:49 But American terrorists acquire bump stocks and use this weapon to mass murder. So the damn math!
4039 2018-02-17 02:29:13 i just want to say thank you to the person who stocks my buildings vending machines
4040 2018-02-17 02:28:28 14 day waiting period
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 round magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements
Minimum age of purchase at 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban

#GunControlNow
4041 2018-02-17 02:28:18 I also agree on bump stocks. No AR-15s sold to general public. There could be acceptions... certified gun “amusement parks”, former military with background check and people who go thru some sort of accreditation/certification to be able to purchase and use.
4042 2018-02-17 02:28:15 I just want all the AR15’s and Bump stocks taken away.
4043 2018-02-17 02:27:14 Why does the NRA even exist anymore?  I mean, they won.  Guy shot 600 people and Vegas and we couldn’t even fucking outlaw bump stocks.  I mean, it’s over.  NRA is as useful as a National Association of Gravity.
4044 2018-02-17 02:26:29 How much more was in your stocks and bonds?you had a nice Valentine's day. Unfortunately 17 families in Florida didn't.  Think  about how you can be part of the solution.
4045 2018-02-17 02:26:23 Thank you for putting #kids ahead of #NRABloodMoney. Banning bunp stocks and #AssaultWeapons doesn't take anyone's guns. Those laws just save lives. #GunContolNow
4046 2018-02-17 02:26:08 You don’t have a lazy eye. You’re beautiful, keep up the good work! Get more girls into crypto!
4047 2018-02-17 02:26:07 Well said carly. It is all about guns. There are bad people & mentally ill people in every country. U.S. has is more guns per person than & easier access than any other country. We need universal background checks, ban on semi auto rifles & bump stocks to start.
4048 2018-02-17 02:26:07 It's part of that pass laws that effect only the stocks they purchase... People are watching
4049 2018-02-17 02:26:04 Will PNB investors suffer? #stocks #tips #bse
4050 2018-02-17 02:26:00 Nobody cares if you ban bump stocks because they're useless pieces of shit. They make the gun fire erratically and accuracy suffers. The Vegas shooter would killed way more folks if he had not put one on the gun.
4051 2018-02-17 02:25:10 *2 stocks opponent* 
Opponent like frame perfect turns to his friend and seriously says:
"Oh it was so close..."


4052 2018-02-17 02:24:35 There's also nothing in the constitution specifically referencing bump stocks or AR-15's.  Oh, and I just realized you have one follower.  Bye now.
4053 2018-02-17 02:24:15 Into crypto right now, But I might dip into stocks Once crypto opens up on Robinhood. Robinhood will be a gateway drug going both ways xD
4054 2018-02-17 02:23:46 hahaha grabe may bago ka nanamang stocks, pero yung para sakin kinain mo dn 
4055 2018-02-17 02:23:25 Bases (contd)... $TAL formed a 6th stage base and then ran from 14 to 36 in nine months. The question of does its 7th-stage base concern me was asked. No, I am more concerned with how its 25% rise in last six days will be handled #stocks
4056 2018-02-17 02:22:32 Rell got bougie. He only come up for 3 hours now in flip flops and no stocks lmaoo
4057 2018-02-17 02:22:30 Pick your poison 

Just want to open the idea up that being 100% in ether of these markets will mean 100% of the risk particularly in crypto as most coins follow $btc . 

A mix of multiple would be ideal. #Stocks IMO have proved more profitable for me in the last than #FX.
4058 2018-02-17 02:22:16 How many stocks make up ~45% weight of QQQ?
4059 2018-02-17 02:21:47 Ban AR15s, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines.
4060 2018-02-17 02:20:36 Yep, but stocks and bonds are fully valued. Even private equity is flooded with cash. What to do with it instead?
4061 2018-02-17 02:20:32 Yes! BN assault rifles, bump stocks, AK15s. Save lives
4062 2018-02-17 02:20:30 Small step.  Add mental illness, No Fly list, ex felons, those convicted of domestic abuse or with protection orders, making threats on social media, etc.  Ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and prohibit civilians from owning body armor.
4063 2018-02-17 02:19:26 I'm against full auto bump stocks and believe in age limits on semiautomatic guns too. 18 buy a five rnd shotgun only 21 take classes to be certified for semi auto rifles. Problem being its not the gun it's the people. Sadly people are very sick. Guns are not evil nor sick.
4064 2018-02-17 02:19:17 Reminds me of the bulletin stocks from dotcom bubble, most of the float is restricted and shady broker behind sceme moving stock around. Don't know what borrow situation but highly manipulated
4065 2018-02-17 02:19:10 Love your content, but I hate XRP. Wasn’t trying to be mean. Hope you reach 100 followers!
4066 2018-02-17 02:18:48 If you are inexperienced w/ this strategy, I would suggest sticking with proper bases, i.e. 5-8 weeks in length, at least. While they may be lower risk, I personally ignore a base count and prefer to use price/volume as my guide #stocks
4067 2018-02-17 02:18:43 Just checked Stock X...2 of my dead stocks would get me 1,000
4068 2018-02-17 02:18:41 @senrobportman @SenSherrodBrown I expect some step towards banning assault rifles & bump stocks.
4069 2018-02-17 02:18:19 I propose banning bump stocks and cranks, a 10 round magazine limit, no sales at gun shows, no sales to one convicted of domestic violence, minimum purchase age of 21...sensible laws. What do you think?
4070 2018-02-17 02:18:19 Same with Bump stocks. Republicans said that Dems were to blame but refuse to move on it.
4071 2018-02-17 02:17:09 What oughta be banned is modifying guns from their original design. That's what the Vegas killer did with those bump stocks.
4072 2018-02-17 02:16:50 Honest people don't use bump stocks to HARM people.  Big difference.
4073 2018-02-17 02:16:23 kung kailan bibilhin ko na tsaka naman nawalan ng stocks!!!! kaqiqil huhu
4074 2018-02-17 02:15:40 So it is far from assured that the totality of the permafrost area will 2/3rds of their carbon stocks?
4075 2018-02-17 02:15:35 It is only a start. Outlaw bump stocks!
4076 2018-02-17 02:14:18 Any time that a teenager, with plenty of red flags, can buy an AR-15 (yet strangely cannot buy a handgun) is a problem with guns. Bump stocks are a problem with guns. Saying that we have to move past a "fallacy" regarding problems with guns is disingenuous at best.

4078 2018-02-17 02:11:42 The heterogeneity across terrain characteristics and time also means some places will be C sinks while others will be sources. And the initial respond to thaw or disturbance may be different than the long term change in stocks. It is extremely complicated!
4079 2018-02-17 02:10:40 @GregRieben indeed! Stumbled across two stocks recently with my attention turning to security on societal levels/ ie $SSTI $AAXN $KTOS ..
4080 2018-02-17 02:09:59 Do you want restrictions on barrel length?  Is shorter better than longer length?  Should there be restrictions on bump stocks, night vision, suppressors? Caliber?  Should we be limited to the # of guns we can own?
4081 2018-02-17 02:09:21 I think stocks running masternodes with user coins, vut I think it is not simple. Everything much simpler. They are selling our deposits for bid prices, bcs of this price been dumped and then, after 20-30 hours they buy our deposits again x2 x3 times cheaper and fill our wallets)
4082 2018-02-17 02:08:06 Wrong! The GOP better fall in line or get voted out. The Democrats are toast thanks to their “all in” Russian collusion narrative! Democrats are now officially laughing stocks. There is no way they survive this fiasco.

4086 2018-02-17 02:06:04 People like this are literally impacting people who own stocks in marijuana companies. Like me and my friends. Whenever Jeff sessions opens his mouth or shit like this gets stirred up, they drop 15-30%

4090 2018-02-17 02:04:25 These days, stocks in the US are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, precisely, because in the olden days, there were many stocks issued that were much like bitcoin, marketed to unsophisticated investors as a get-rich-quick scheme. #bitcoin #بيتكوين

4096 2018-02-17 02:00:19 Haven’t been able to stop thinking about the fact that gun sales (and stocks in gun manufacturers) spike after mass shootings. Terrible enough that people make a living selling objects designed to kill humans, but absolutely sickening they financially benefit from those deaths
4097 2018-02-17 02:00:08 Market Close: MBS +25bps; DOW +19.01; NASDAQ -16.96; S&P 500 +1.02; 10yr Treasury 2.88%; MBS rebounds a bit and stocks close mostly positive, but off of earlier highs.
4098 2018-02-17 01:59:49 Rob, next year you should include DRIP’s in your survey.  Unbelievably some firms don’t offer DRIP’s for US stocks.
4099 2018-02-17 01:59:11 in Nature of Economies Jane's powerful insight was that creative import shifting & stretching created new resource stocks & what we call "innovations" due to local insights on demand. This is not a feature of globalism.
4100 2018-02-17 01:59:09 The only difference btwn cash deal vs all stock is what you think about the acquiring stocks value. In cash deal you made your money and its done. In all stock deal you are now long the acquirers stock (AMZN in this example). So treat your new long position accordingly.
4101 2018-02-17 01:59:00 The Las Vegas shooter had bump stocks on his ARs to fire in automatic succession. Why does anybody need that? In the hood in the woods idc
4102 2018-02-17 01:57:31 Automatics aren't illegal. We can still own them you just have to go through a certain process and have the money. Also pretty much all shootings here have been with semi auto rifles. Maybe like 1 or 2 have been with full auto rifles. Bump stocks don't count.
4103 2018-02-17 01:56:19 Bump stocks too. Problem is she can't get them up for votes. Wonder why? #NRABloodMoney
4104 2018-02-17 01:54:25 Lock pollies to stocks in public and tourists will flock to Canberra.
4105 2018-02-17 01:52:31 run the stocks out of my basement, theres lots of room and i wont let anyone get swindled
4106 2018-02-17 01:50:38 Yes, the statistics bear it out. No AK47,s, no bump stocks. WE WILL VOTE, Madame President, we will vote!
4107 2018-02-17 01:49:54 No, we really DON’T know who did it. If you know anything at all, or have any familiarity with semi-Auto, semi-Auto with “bump stocks” and full auto and watch and listen to the multitude of videos available, you’d know 1) not just 1 shooter & 2, not just “bump” stocks.
4108 2018-02-17 01:49:39 It's any rifle that can be used to fire a large amount of rounds in a short amount of time either by design or modifications such as "bump stocks" or high capacity magazines. My husband's 30-30 is lever action and only holds 5 rounds w/one in the chamber.
4109 2018-02-17 01:49:09 Wow ! Imagine if they had bump stocks and a hi rise window!
4110 2018-02-17 01:48:48 aR-15 removed from the public, bump stocks removed from the public , you can keep your guns and rifle , mental illness get help and no access to guns , that's a start
4111 2018-02-17 01:48:39 BTW, the 2nd amendment does not actually give you the right to assault rifles, bump stocks & silencers either. And if you need a silencer to prevent hearing loss when you shoot, what are you doing? Sounds like shooting guns is a hobby for you.
4112 2018-02-17 01:47:51 And I agree with a commenter below. Ban high capacity magazines & bump stocks.
4113 2018-02-17 01:47:37 Bump stocks are an interesting case, as they're a physical manifestation of what is fundamentally a protest-act. People who don't think the Federal Govt./ATF should be able to regulate fully automatic arms create a device to circumvent the spirit of the law.
4114 2018-02-17 01:47:29 I am sure that President Obama signed the Bill passing Bump Stocks to turn guns into machine guns.
4115 2018-02-17 01:47:18 SAY SO!!!!  This has real world application!!! Stocks teaching life!! Congrats!
4116 2018-02-17 01:47:08 Hahaha atleast I’m not desperate enough to put up a fake photo of an attractive female to gain followers
4117 2018-02-17 01:46:57 Why now?  What happened to banning bump stocks after Vegas?  If you and your fellow Senators were in the private sector you’d all be fired (both parties).  Results, not actions or words!
4118 2018-02-17 01:46:47 For the love of God, YES! I can't believe you even need to ask. How many mass shootings do you need? Ban assault weapons. And ban bump stocks while you are at it.
4119 2018-02-17 01:46:08 Well that’s a start how about a ban on bump stocks as well as making folks sign a waiver to release their medical records and if they have a history of substance abuse or mental illness then they cannot buy an AR-15
4120 2018-02-17 01:45:48 Checkout the US steel space. section 232 preliminary report tabled by secretary Ross. Steel stocks jumped up in double digits during intra trade.  global impact
4121 2018-02-17 01:45:15 Next budget showdown hold out on one simple and widely popular gun restriction. AND DON'T GIVE IN!
Something like Feinstein's ban on those on the terror watchlist not having access to guns or outlawing bump stocks country wide.
Then do it each time.
4122 2018-02-17 01:44:23 The two largest economies in the world 1) U.S- recognized the Paris agreement is a globalist cash grab and pulled out of it, economy & stocks are now skyrocketing 2) China made a mockery out of the Paris agreement by actually increasing their emissions in the next few years.
4123 2018-02-17 01:44:16 He bought more Casio stocks so must be into something
4124 2018-02-17 01:44:07 Unfortunately there's always going to be weird oddballs no matter how well you try and define things. In fact manufacturers will intentionally circumvent discriptions. Look at bump stocks, there's no good reason to design a firearm like that, they're only there to use a loophole
4125 2018-02-17 01:43:57 I’ll let you in on a trick. Whenever people start talking about stocks, you should wait until they finish and then say “and THAT’s why you should always diversify”, wink, then walk away.
4126 2018-02-17 01:43:09 THIS BETTER BE NOT IN LIMITED STOCKS!!!
4127 2018-02-17 01:42:26 Hahaha atleast I’m not desperate enough to put up a fake photo of an attractive female to gain followers
4128 2018-02-17 01:42:12 After Congress allowed sundown to happen to the assault rifle ban, 317 students have died in our schools. #CommonSenseGunLaws are desperately needed in our country. The NRA pays off the GOP to do NOTHING. THIS HAS TO STOP! NRA dumped millions into the GOP to not ban bump stocks.
4129 2018-02-17 01:42:08 I'm so sick of "they're takin our guns".. no! We just don't feel like ya's need enough ammo & the ability to blow away countless innocent ppl! We want responsible gun owners & the politicians to SERVE THE COUNTRY NOT THEMSELVES! We need our kids more than u need bump stocks.
4130 2018-02-17 01:42:00 It has benefitted Gujarat Ambuja exports and kriti nutrients as they are holding huge stocks.  Sanwaria  has no stocks.  Guj Ambuja holding over 1.5 lakh ton soya seed.
4131 2018-02-17 01:41:05 But why do you need them? To engage w/ guns as a hobby? What about the other items I mentioned - the bump stocks and assault rifles? No one defending silencers is mentioning those.
4132 2018-02-17 01:40:57 I’m probably older than you haha I was joking.
4133 2018-02-17 01:40:33 I wouldn't call it that. It's not the guns being regulated in my hypothetical situation. It's the health of individuals. Regulating guns would be "No guns above the caliber .22" or "No guns with adjustable stocks"
4134 2018-02-17 01:40:07 There is a lot of tax info left out: RRSPs and US withholding tax; capital gains benefit on Canadian stocks is lost when they're sold from a TFSA vs a cash account; precious metal coins sold for less than $1K are considered personal property and not subject to capital gains...
4135 2018-02-17 01:39:45 Caring so much for someone yet they don’t see if/know destroys you
4136 2018-02-17 01:39:02 There's no right to assault rifles, silencers or bump stocks. Don't cite 2nd amendment. These aren't mentioned there. Declaration of Independence grants Americans these unalienable rights - life, liberty & pursuit of happiness. I can assure you assault weapons interfere with this
4137 2018-02-17 01:38:19 Because of you I have put all my money in mouth guard stocks. Keep lighting the lamp big guy!!! #flamestothecup2018
4138 2018-02-17 01:36:13 ‘Our President’ ha! 
Don’t bother tweeting. Nobody from the rest of the world cares anymore, America has gone past the point of no return. Your stocks have crashed, your value is zero.

4140 2018-02-17 01:32:38 Time is up!  Legislation barring the use of all things automatic ... guns, stocks, and the guns too. If you aren't a soldier or cop you don't  need an automatic weapon.  Our ancestors would agree!  Turn back gun makers support. Back to conflict of interest cause it is.
4141 2018-02-17 01:32:29 "hard assets"? Like what? USD? Which perpetually loses it's purchasing power? Gold? Which is manipulated? Stocks? Pumped up by money printing? Which ones?
4142 2018-02-17 01:31:44 Hooray! Common ground: bump stocks ARE stupid. 

I thought "military grade" meant metal not plastic and was more a "preference thing" that only you had the power to decide. 

Not really sure why you keep asking about flipping states...? Can you explain?
4143 2018-02-17 01:31:39 Yes! And, those extra big magazines and bump stocks, too!
4144 2018-02-17 01:30:21 It's worth noting that gun maker stocks go up every time there's a mass shooting. Why? Because customers buy up guns in case the event spawns new restrictions.

Crime, including mass murder, is good business for these companies, because white people buy guns when they're scared.
4145 2018-02-17 01:29:47 Repubs made sure nothing would pass that the NRA would not like.  Assault rifles need to go, period.  Only military and LEOs should have them.  Then high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  Regular folks don’t need ARs.  I am pro second amendment, but no ARs.
4146 2018-02-17 01:29:36 Those teams likely have small stocks of SB2 engines that they already own, which makes the cost of buying the new NT1 while making their current inventory obsolete too much for their small budgets.  I'd expect to see them move to NT1 eventually, however
4147 2018-02-17 01:27:23 AR-15s are not fully automatic. They’re semi-automatic, which is legal.  Semis are one pull of the trigger = 1 shot vs one pull = many shots for a fully automatic. Bump stocks can help a weapon fire a bit faster, but accuracy is degraded.
4148 2018-02-17 01:26:30 "While the Dutch East India Company became the first entity to sell stocks on a public exchange in the early 1600s, it was not until the 20th century that a comprehensive framework for deriving the fundamental value of equity securities was developed"
4149 2018-02-17 01:25:50 SCOTUS made a nod to the firearm evolution arguement drawing the line at one round per pull... (btw, bump stocks are STUPID)

And THERE is generally accepted as your "military grade" distinction

Any FURTHER incursion will require an amendment

What states are you going to flip?
4150 2018-02-17 01:25:42 Stocks naman basahin natin.
4151 2018-02-17 01:25:11 My dad is trying to teach me stocks and I am confusion 
4152 2018-02-17 01:23:50 I believe and value the right to bear arms.  I strongly believe and value the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  When one right infringes upon an inalienable right it is time to make a change.  Perhaps no more assault weapons, no more bump stocks.
4153 2018-02-17 01:23:34 @SenFeinstein With all due respect, NO ONE should be allowed to purchase Automatic Weapons or Bump Stocks. That needs to be the goal. The Vegas shooter was well over 21. #BanAssaultWeapons
4154 2018-02-17 01:22:19 What about bump stocks? Can’t they make some of these guns more lethal? Not trying to get in a fight btw, asking a question only, as I don’t know much about guns. I didn’t realize they weren’t selling ARs anymore: why are there so many around? No registry?
4155 2018-02-17 01:21:32 Had you look at the stocks were certainly was brought all his present.
4156 2018-02-17 01:21:29 Work day accomplished, exercise & spa completed, stocks end week in the green, weekend is here. #satisfaction

4158 2018-02-17 01:19:49 When he left screams "Gun Control!" buy some gun stocks (either one). That is the catalyst to great gun sales.

Thanks Obama!

4160 2018-02-17 01:18:30 Carter Paige was given 11Billion in stocks for his treason. Yet as we know that went to Mark Rich, a criminal
4161 2018-02-17 01:18:28 No ones taking your guns away snowflakes, we want more comprehensive background checks and better restrictions on ammo capacity and accessories like bump stocks.
4162 2018-02-17 01:16:29 for less than 3% of gun violence so I don’t think banning AR’s will solve anything. My focus, if it mattered, would be banning bump stocks, limiting firearms in each household, tracking ammo sales, and having networks (FBI, law enforcement, and mental health) interoperable.
4163 2018-02-17 01:15:46 Would that be like Republicans voted against banning bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting.  Seriously wake up!
4164 2018-02-17 01:15:26 we can make our way to the dance floor, and sit like strangers!! like an elevator stocks between stories!!!!
4165 2018-02-17 01:14:05 My stocks are going up!!! 
4166 2018-02-17 01:13:56 @VanDrewForNJ @tanziefornj If you should win, as my member of Congress, would you support a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks, limiting magazine capacities and universal background checks those wishing to purchase firearms?
4167 2018-02-17 01:13:34 Stocks had the best week in 5 years. I know I’ll always remember where I was during The Great, Not-So-Great, Recession of 2018.
4168 2018-02-17 01:13:29 Yep. And those that can be converted with 'bump stocks' or whatever to assault weapons. And shut down ammunition manufacturers that sell to the public for these weapons!
4169 2018-02-17 01:12:54 All good info. Large magazines and bump stocks and other enhancers should all be banned in the same spirit that automatic weapons are banned. However, that would do nothing to stop these types of crimes.
4170 2018-02-17 01:12:49 Don’t bother tweeting. Nobody from the rest of the world cares anymore, America has gone past the point of no return. Your stocks have crashed, your value is zero.

4171 2018-02-17 01:12:29 The @theblackpanther movie that came out just boosted up alot of brothers stocks, lol.
4172 2018-02-17 01:12:23 No one should be able to buy an assault rifle, They should be for military use only. And why would anyone want silencers or deadly bump stocks. They all should be banned.
4173 2018-02-17 01:12:07 I think tighter may be possible, but not a turn in or anything like that. Not sure where you are getting that. But we couldn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas, so not sure what to tell you.
4174 2018-02-17 01:11:15 Stocks plunged as Merck & Co., Inc. unveiled a lazy bowl today.
4175 2018-02-17 01:10:45 Vote against any politition who will not support common sense gun control: ban bump stocks. #litmustest
4176 2018-02-17 01:07:47 Bump stocks, as I understood it, was just a start of the discussion. As it seemed like low hanging fruit that the left could even get the NRA to agree on. But the NRA pushed back on it, so the bill never went anywhere.
4177 2018-02-17 01:06:16 GOP is responsible by valuing NRA contributions more than human lives. Trump signed bill to make it easier for mentally ill to get guns. Everyone was for getting rid of bump stocks Ryan blocked it. GOP wouldn't even vote to not let people on the terrorist watch list get guns.
4178 2018-02-17 01:06:12 hot take: cryptocurrency is stocks
4179 2018-02-17 01:05:51 That's reaching in my opinion. There are far less credible stocks out there touting crypto that should not be trading. Why PDXP? follow the trail..the money will lead u there.
4180 2018-02-17 01:05:05 We need new and strong gun restrictions. Ban the AR 15 and it’s ammunition and bump stocks. Stronger background checks.  Just to start. Don’t be a shill for the NRA we need dems who stand strong against the gun lobby.
4181 2018-02-17 01:04:49 Thank you! If I lose all my money I’m suing you tho
4182 2018-02-17 01:04:42 Go (or take your kid) to your state house that day and visit your senator and rep. Demand they sponsor/vote for legislation that 1. Bans assault rifles, high capacity mags, bump stocks; 2. mandates background checks; 3. bans private sales; 4. launches buyback program, 5. More.
4183 2018-02-17 01:03:01 Yes ! Immediately also ban bump stocks & cranks !
4184 2018-02-17 01:02:51 @realDonaldTrump  Hey Jackass tell me how your dumb ass wall is going to protect us against white male school and mass killers.  I thought all the murders were Mexicans?  Did they carry all those AR15's, bump stocks and oversized magazines across the border?  Do something right!
4185 2018-02-17 01:02:41 In stocks, don't fight the fed. In crypto don't fight the 
4186 2018-02-17 01:02:31 You say it is too soon after Parkland shooting to talk about gun control. So it has been 4+ months since Vegas shooting. Is that enough time to for u to act? Why did u refuse to allow a bill about bump stocks to be brought to the floor?
4187 2018-02-17 01:02:25 Need to ban all assault weapons and ban all bump stocks. Keep our children safe @realDonaldTrump
4188 2018-02-17 01:00:53 We can ban high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and have all guns registered.  Restore blocking sales to mentally ill that Trump overturned and just signed into law.
4189 2018-02-17 01:00:33 So sad!  We, adults, need to make sure assault weapons and bump stocks are banned!
4190 2018-02-17 00:59:57 BMP stocks are stupid, however the same can be done with a loose grip on the gun and a belt loop. Would a crisper aftermarket trigger be banned as well. U tube search rapid magazine changes a little practice and mag size doesn’t matter.
4191 2018-02-17 00:59:12 Saw a story in CNN that was calling this week Trump's worst week ever. What? The Russian story has been debunked,  he delivered a powerful message in the aftermath of a tragedy, stocks are rising again. They had an affair no one cares about and they got caught tying again. Fools
4192 2018-02-17 00:58:31 You cant buy stocks with a cc though. I wouldn't worry...
4193 2018-02-17 00:57:44 There is already a bipartisan bill for the bump stocks. There are certain classes of assault rifles that are used for hunting that are not the AR 15. Its important to know that the 2nd ammendment wasnt used to protect against robbers and murders but to protect against the govnmt
4194 2018-02-17 00:57:15 I want thorough background checks, a ban on domestic abusers obtaining guns, appropriate restrictions on MH signed back into law, age limits raised, possibly gun owner liability insurance and a deff ban on bump stocks & assault weapons. I don't want to take ppl's freaking guns!
4195 2018-02-17 00:56:46 I buy physical silver at APMEX....or easy to buy is Sliver ETF - SLV. There are many other options for Silver stocks.
4196 2018-02-17 00:55:32 If people are mentally ill we already have laws to stop it if you get Dems to support the @NRA ban bump stocks and make changes to HIPA laws that may have stopped this shooting. By the way @FBI was warned and failed these kids the laws were there and again failed to be used.
4197 2018-02-17 00:55:10 2. Go ahead and take bump stocks they are worthless in my eyes completly inaccurate and also a waste of time to learn and money in ammo.
4198 2018-02-17 00:55:09 All this talk from @Coinbase and other exchanges regarding buying #crypto with Credit cards etc... is very misleading.

4201 2018-02-17 00:54:05 I read the first tweet as stocks and this combo was hella darker.
4202 2018-02-17 00:53:56 looks to me like we need to fire them all,take $ out of politics,and start over... "bump stocks"..smh...so dude kills 35 instead of 50...AT LEAST go after magazine capacity if they want to APPEAR to be concerned...
4203 2018-02-17 00:51:47 can we quit excusing the left...?  their bright idea after las vegas was "ban bump stocks"..after the nra vaguely hinted at that being the problem. how many Democrats take money from the nra?  theyre playing bait and switch as much as republicans are ignoring the issue completely
4204 2018-02-17 00:50:26 How much more do you need to make from holding stocks before you are indifferent between stocks ($SPY) and Government Bonds (10yr Treasury)?

@tedcruz @JohnCornyn pass some damn gun restrictions. 
No assault rifles 
no bump stocks 
no silencers
4209 2018-02-17 00:48:10 @marthamaccallum The NRA supports gun safety programs, supports enhanced background checks, supports the ban on bump stocks. NRA members an other gun owners are responsible citizens.  Have any of the mass shooters  NRA members?  I don't think so. Criminals will always have guns.
4210 2018-02-17 00:46:56 You want to know where is a good place to start? 

Sensible gun restrictions. If thst includes banning the sale of bump stocks and semiautomatic weapons which can be turned into fully automatic killing machines then so be it.   

Thoughts and prayers do not stop bullets.
4211 2018-02-17 00:46:43 problem. Those seconds you have to take to reload in an emergency can be the difference between life and death for you. Don’t know anything about bump stocks and cranks - so no comment there. What kind of child locks are you talking about? Like safes and stuff? Most if not all
4212 2018-02-17 00:46:37 You are freakin clueless!
1)A-R's w bump stocks are innaccurate as hell.
2) rate of fire means nothing if you can't hit what you're aiming at.
3)A-R w "bump stock" does not = full auto.
4213 2018-02-17 00:44:57 Ban high efficiency equipment like tracer ammo, bump stocks, etc. Make it more difficult to purchase assault rifles. I understand the similarity to hunting rifles and that they are used for recreational shooting, but the reason they were created is to kill.
4214 2018-02-17 00:43:40 Right!  Also work on ban on assault weapons and bump stocks!

4218 2018-02-17 00:38:59 @tedcruz you’re a disgusting POS that’s taken millions from the NRA to NEVER enact sensible gun reform. No one needs military assault weapons, bump stocks, magazines to shoot multiples bullets. We need strict background checks. Mass shootings will never stop because of u & GOP!
4219 2018-02-17 00:38:48 Stocks

4222 2018-02-17 00:37:35 Back to normal. My feed during the week is stocks and futures and the weekend is racing. I hate off season and holidays.
4223 2018-02-17 00:37:28 If u argue that civilians should have right to own semi-automatic weapons w/ bump stocks to protect themselves against a prospectively corrupt govt, pls realize that said govt has armies, tanks, missiles, jets & nuclear weapons, good luck fighting them off w/ ur AR-15 u jackass
4224 2018-02-17 00:37:12 Haven't really seen a case of auto used. The closest is bump stocks which allow for 3 round bursts. They can be made on a 3d printer. We need the fbi more focused on investigating threats then used for politics. Get special investigators to investigate politicians not the fbi.
4225 2018-02-17 00:37:05 No, they are not.  AR-15s are being sold as we speak.  Bump stocks are only being banned in a few states, but nothing countrywide and states are “looking” at it.  Where the heck do you get your info from?
4226 2018-02-17 00:36:42 Look no further than the Miami FBI Field Office.  And of course an absolute ban on civilian possession of assault rifles, bump stocks and silencers is long overdue.

4228 2018-02-17 00:35:32 @SenTedCruz no one wants to trample on amendment 2. What American voters want are common sense gun control. Why do non military people need military assault guns, bump stocks, or 100s of bullets and magazines. One purpose only to kill people. Pass common sense gun control
4229 2018-02-17 00:35:27 Once I get my stocks into place and my money comes in. I’m going to finally spoil myself and get myself a nice up to date laptop maybe a decent gaming laptop. Promised myself this and I will do just that
4230 2018-02-17 00:35:25 You buy a bitcoin when no one is using it. Then, when it starts being used as a form of payment (which it is) it increases Bitcoins fungibility, thereby increasing its value. 
Its the same thing with precious metals, and the same with stocks. Fungibility
4231 2018-02-17 00:34:29 Taxation is a transfer. Mining is a economically incentivized activity which is only dilutive to the existing supply in an inflationary sense. This is mitigated by a deflationary emission curve. Non-dividend stocks are a comparable abstraction. What does a share in apple mean?
4232 2018-02-17 00:34:23 I’m new to stocks but won’t we see the stock rise when it gets approved or will it rise once there package is sent in? Thanks
4233 2018-02-17 00:32:34 You can’t argue with cretins. They can’t process. We vote out ANY MoC who took money from the NRA. We flip the House. We flip the Senate and we ban Assault Rifles and bump stocks.  We buy them back and make it a crime to own them. Australia can do it. We can too. #EnoughIsEnough
4234 2018-02-17 00:32:24 Wouldn’t it be great if you would take this opportunity to lead. Get Congress to quickly pass a ban on Bump stocks, assault weapons. Ban gun purchases by people on the no fly list, background checks and wait times for all. Is America not as Great as Australia? Don’t hide......
4235 2018-02-17 00:32:01 Diversify your #investments that include a broad mix of stocks and bonds. Have an exit strategy to manage your risk.

4237 2018-02-17 00:31:36 1. Repeal the 2nd amendment (btw, this is not the same as a ban on guns)
2. Ban assault rifles, bumper stocks, high capacity mags, etc. 
3. Appropriate $2 million for every person killed in a mass shooting in 2017, use the money to buy back all the stuff banned.

4239 2018-02-17 00:30:54 What I mean is, people crave simple answers. They don't want to consider the proliferation of semi auto, or lightweight kits, bump stocks, etc, that have drastically changed the game.
4240 2018-02-17 00:30:16 Oregon is very old school country and it's going to be a tough fight.  I think many would agree to get rid of automatic weapons and bump stocks, but if too extreme a platform you'd lose them.  It's rough country with lots of dangerous wildlife.  This character is an asshat. 
4241 2018-02-17 00:30:15 Do you prefer to invest in stocks, mutual funds, your company’s 401k, Real Estate or something else?
4242 2018-02-17 00:29:27 I see these posts saying, "guns didn't change, we changed," like George Washington and Co. were marching around with AR-15s and bump-stocks and they just forgot to tell the rest of us in history class.
4243 2018-02-17 00:29:15 Ok fine, get rid of bump stocks. You can rig any semi automatic weapon to fire automatically so it probably wouldn’t do much.
4244 2018-02-17 00:29:12 @FinFreeFlex fusz and byoc. really like these 2 stocks
4245 2018-02-17 00:28:42 飛行機天候不良で遅延かー。飛ばないとかあるんかな。
4246 2018-02-17 00:28:22 We need to stop congress from allowing bump stocks. The AR-15 is dangerous enough in the wrong hands without making it completely automatic.
4247 2018-02-17 00:28:13 There is no "right" to AR-15s and bump stocks.
4248 2018-02-17 00:27:53 Million dollar idea.
Incorporate fleshlights into gun stocks.
It is the thing they love the most.
#FuckYourGun
4249 2018-02-17 00:27:40 Ex.: Manufacturers started making select parts and assembling "kits" in the US to get around import restrictions on AK variants. Manufacturers riveted folding stocks in the open position to comply with NFA, anyone with a drill press could "convert" the stock back to folding
4250 2018-02-17 00:27:15 All this money you made in these stocks plus that per diem?!? I’ll get you back when my tax refund hits
4251 2018-02-17 00:26:21 Of course guns that were specifically designed to kill people are the problem. You going to use bump stocks, large capacity magazines, and armor piercing rounds to hunt deer?
4252 2018-02-17 00:26:15 op guns, explosives and knives into schools. Stop giving wealthy people tax breaks when the technology on bridges in NY that works can be employed in sensitive areas. Prohibit detachable stocks...so people can’t hide them. 22+, 3 day wait, and 2 rifle, 5 magazine maximum...we c
4253 2018-02-17 00:26:07 Well airdrop I hate to sound so harsh when I say this but you sound like you dont have a background in trading, $3 was beginning of new year and historically in the stock market and crypto jan-feb are always the worst months for crypto and stocks. It is in fact a great project.
4254 2018-02-17 00:25:30 Right? And Jesus turned water into silencers, bump stocks, and magazines.
4255 2018-02-17 00:25:28 Might take more than penny stocks bro
4256 2018-02-17 00:24:19 You should pay more attention, the NRA has been trying to get bump stocks banned for a while.  But unfortunately those actually want good solid gun laws passed encounter fanatic anti-gunners who won't settle for anything less than extremes
4257 2018-02-17 00:23:45 Then fight for drug abuse, as a former addict I would appreciate it. All I hear is defending guns. I have never said ban guns. Now bump stocks yes. Yes drugs are a problem and do lead to mental illness. Yet our leaders just sit their butts and do nothing.
4258 2018-02-17 00:23:01 Can we just ban AR-15s already?  And bump stocks?
4259 2018-02-17 00:22:50 Certainly there are degrees. For example, China has many state owned enterprises but also publicly traded stocks.

But much of what people talk about as examples of socialism *simply are not socialism*. It's a category error that has nothing to do with spectrum or no spectrum.
4260 2018-02-17 00:19:41 Hey, we can't even ban bump stocks after a nut setup a machine gun nest in a casino tower and caused mass loss of life and limb—basically a plastic toy!
4261 2018-02-17 00:18:56 You got 2 sets & im on stocks SMH
4262 2018-02-17 00:18:21 when algos are up up up im ok LOL not down even a bit! $baba weak today so lagging stocks a lot today.
4263 2018-02-17 00:17:37 Today has been a crazy day here in Mexico City! This shift in stocks has done a great impact on business
4264 2018-02-17 00:17:15 It's a start, at least. I'd support it. I'd like to see AR-15s off the table, along with bump stocks.
4265 2018-02-17 00:16:17 Constituents who want assault rifles, bump stocks, extended clips, etc? I think you have bad data. Bans all of those are largely supported by Americans in all areas.
4266 2018-02-17 00:16:16 Less than one week past the stock market dumper and already recovered almost all the losses. This was a fantastic chance to buy into, or buy down, your costs on numerous fantastic companies. Gotta love the market. #stocks #stockmarket #StockMarketCrash
4267 2018-02-17 00:15:59 It is noble to try and ban a gun but we can make changes that are even more simple. Ban bump stocks and extended mags. It’s not much but it’s a start. You eat a cow one bite at a time, not whole. Thorough background checks and mental health screening is a must
4268 2018-02-17 00:15:57 Heyyyy thx Rebecca! @morgan_willett, now you’re forced to ask me to come back. 
4269 2018-02-17 00:15:46 BACK ON MY STOCKS BABY!!!
4270 2018-02-17 00:15:44 Do you understand the semi autos such as the AR 15 can be fitted with bump stocks which makes them practically the same as automatic rifles??
4271 2018-02-17 00:15:11 I know bump stocks are legal. I’m unclear if internally modifying an AR-15 to full auto is legal; and, if the necessary parts are available for civilian purchase online.
4272 2018-02-17 00:15:05 Can we add: 
Ban bump stocks
Straw man purchaser is charged if the gun is used in a crime
4273 2018-02-17 00:13:04 You want a suggestion? Ban assault weapon sales. Outlaw magazines that hold more than a dozen cartridges. Ban the sale of bump stocks. Require gun locks and impose criminal penalties for those who own guns that others use in crimes. You want more?
4274 2018-02-17 00:11:28 Sponsored any bills that matter lately? Talked about banning assault weapons, bump stocks?  How’d you vote on those couple of DACA proposals today? Oh yeah, got it, you’re still performing exactly as the NRA paid you to.
4275 2018-02-17 00:10:28 @garyvee Can researching stocks in trading/flipping them be considered for the #2018flipchallenge ? Love talking with anyone about it!
4276 2018-02-17 00:10:17 Q: How do you invest in a comedy network?

A: LAUGHING STOCKS
4277 2018-02-17 00:09:02 Ban armor-piercing (cop-killer) bullets
Limit magazines to 9 rounds
Ban bump stocks
Mandatory trigger locks
Reckless endangerment charges for owners if a child of <13 gets ahold of a gun without supervision and fires it. Manslaughter if the child kills someone.
4278 2018-02-17 00:08:50 I'd also like to include attachments that are also only used to kill such as bump stocks and extra large magazines, but even just banning assault weapons is enough for me.
4279 2018-02-17 00:08:34 7grand for stocks alone. Love it but can't touch it feel it. #TANGIBLEFLIPS
4280 2018-02-17 00:08:03 I completely agree with joe on this one. Why does it infringe on your liberty for there to be limitations on which death machines / magazine sizes / bump stocks, etc are legal for sale to civilians..? Help me out here..
4281 2018-02-17 00:07:27 "Put everyone who criticized HRC into the stocks until they rue the day they supported Bernie in the primary."

Silence her critics, because they led to us having a president who gets authoritarian when criticized?

We should argue amongst ourselves, but this smells funny.
4282 2018-02-17 00:07:14 Los resultados integrales incluyen resultados que son non-cash, por ejemplo, diferencias de cambio de inventarios de materias primas (stocks). Hasta que no se vende el producto terminado no se convertirán en cash. Yo tomaría el resultado neto, el integral es posibilidad a futuro.

4284 2018-02-17 00:06:15 Not the politicians. They are well funded by your glorious NRA. Why not look at mental illness, why not look at bump stocks? You gun lovers always get defensive when mass shootings take place. Yet 90 percent of the country support second amendment. Guns are not the problem.
4285 2018-02-17 00:05:48 Sleep is a good cure. LOL

Markets never sleep and  are always on our minds. I find myself  waking up numerous times during the night, researching or checking out new stocks and charts.

Nature of the beast when your income is made from the market.
4286 2018-02-17 00:05:46 Our lawmakers at the Congressional level are gutless cowards in the pocket of the NRA( of which I am a member). They can’t even outlaw bump stocks or assault rifles. In fact, anyone can get an AR15 kit online with NO federal paperwork.
4287 2018-02-17 00:04:32 I think we could add a few. I don't need armor piercing rounds & if #BlueLivesMatter I think we shouldn't have access to armor piercing rounds. Bump stocks need to go. You defo don't need an assault rifle to hunt. & yes enforcing what is already on the books.
4288 2018-02-17 00:03:45 Are you in NRA's pocket? Let's ALL get TOGETHER & honor all lives lost by use of assault weapons/bump stocks...BAN WEAPONS OF WAR.
4289 2018-02-17 00:02:27 Huge savings on clearance items. While stocks last. No holds or lay-bys.
4290 2018-02-17 00:00:58 Please support banning assault weapons & bump stocks NOW. Parents DESTROYED & HEARTS SHATTERED by a weapon of war. 2A & Trump supporter.
4291 2018-02-16 23:59:24 Leave #NigelFarage to #LBC. Up to them if they feel the need to massage his ego. Many of us who watch #bbcqt think #Farage is a national laughing stock! In fact, he should be in the stocks. But not #BBC stocks!

4294 2018-02-16 23:57:37 For the record i feel very bullish on weed stocks right now, next week will decide it IMO.
4295 2018-02-16 23:57:13 I can't believe that every Trump supporter likes to throw out the 401K excuse. It's unlikely that theirs, if they have one, is actually invested in any of the 30 stocks on the DJIA.
4296 2018-02-16 23:57:07 They should go up! It’s proof they know how to rig complicated systems. Stocks should reflect confidence in that skill!
4297 2018-02-16 23:56:39 We should set their film stocks on fire to help stave off the frost.
4298 2018-02-16 23:56:30 BAN ASSAULT RIFLES, HIGH & MEDIUM CAPACITY MAGAZINES, AND BUMP STOCKS AND SILENCERS!!!
4299 2018-02-16 23:56:07 SE, seriously? Don’t you have a son? Does he really feel safe knowing when he goes to school allows people to buy semi automatic weapons or bumps stocks? Or do you home school?
4300 2018-02-16 23:55:44 $NEE carried me today, all my brick and morter stock up, all my tech down.

4305 2018-02-16 23:54:15 Sometimes all we can/should say is "I am so sorry for your loss & pain" THEN go to DC & PASS LAWS TO OUTLAW ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS!!!
4306 2018-02-16 23:53:26 True. And for things like bump stocks. There's plenty of common sense gun control that can be enacted w/o a gun ban. 100%
4307 2018-02-16 23:52:50 Unfortunately Jaime, the Politicians here in the USA, the GOP and others have no guts or do they have a spine to fight the NRA and pass any meaningful legislature that will ban assault rifles, bump stocks and the like.
4308 2018-02-16 23:52:46 An AR-15 is.
More deadly by the automatic reloading (using those bumb-stocks), and by the distance the bullet is supposed to travel.
For pure self-defence, if you want to have a gun, a simple handgun suffices.
But I would prefer(ed) martial arts.  That skill: always with you.
4309 2018-02-16 23:52:36 But it's a 'mental health issue.' So what did we do recently? Cut massive amounts of money FOR mental health. There is no reason for bump stocks to be legal. Completely unnecessary.
4310 2018-02-16 23:51:43 And they advised against bump stocks, then Obama approved them.

4332 2018-02-16 23:50:30 Hey, if your good with calling a >110Mmbbl drop in OECD crude stocks, in one year, not a trend, and minor, but a weekly faux increase of 20mbbls, something to consider significant, like I said, your $.
4333 2018-02-16 23:50:17 Just expand too quickly. Over expansion too rapidly in the economy and stocks leads to you-know-what.

4335 2018-02-16 23:47:41 Expecting money to inflow to #crypto market this year, hedge funds are hungry for high returns. #US #stocks is still quiet attractive but most companies are priced in and it's a lot harder to find bargains, unless you have a crystal ball or SecretSauce model for valuations.
4336 2018-02-16 23:46:51 The Las Vegas massacre was definitely done to wage war on Americans and take more gun advantages away from them. That is why all the extra guns were brought up to the Mandalay Bay room. The bump stocks to be banned were not effective enough to kill folks en masse. Planted for ban
4337 2018-02-16 23:45:34 funny how there is so much bearish presumption on the weed stocks right now. I'm looking at the same chart as everyone else and all it needs is one good day and a close above that downtrend line on decent volume and its a whole new uptrend started....just sayin....
4338 2018-02-16 23:44:56 Ted Cruz- we desperately need all of these actions!  Ban military style assault weapons!  Ban bump stocks!  Prevent convicted criminals from buying guns of any kind!  Make it difficult for individuals with mental health issues to buy guns!  Why is this so difficult!
4339 2018-02-16 23:42:08 LOL...Liberals have been in power 8 years! They did NOTHING about guns, except LEGALIZE fully automatic bump stocks in 2010...as used by the Vegas killer!!  Nice nap???
4340 2018-02-16 23:41:10 AR15 is not a military style weapon. These & 1000's of others have been around for a very long time.
In fact most hunting rifles are much more powerful than the very small bullet of the AR15. Generic they wooden stocks and just don't look like Hollywood.
4341 2018-02-16 23:40:25 If you want to see suits to go Wall Street and trade stocks.
4342 2018-02-16 23:40:18 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4343 2018-02-16 23:39:56 You’re the one being easily fooled. Semi-automatic weapons cannot be “simply converted” to automatic. They use completely different trigger systems. And no, bump stocks don’t actually make the gun full automatic. They are the same as Jerry Miculek’s finger. Thank Obama for those.
4344 2018-02-16 23:39:48 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4345 2018-02-16 23:39:38 It shows the limit of your personal intelligence by continuing to defend the indefensible !
You can argue till you are blue in the face, "Slaughtering Dolphins" is "Wrong" !
Japan sees Dolphins as a sea pest, which takes their fish stocks. The real answer is Japan's overfishing !
4346 2018-02-16 23:38:54 Wys @BALENCIAGA Stocks...
4347 2018-02-16 23:38:06 The only thing the GOP wishes was different about all these school shootings is that the shooters would have been immigrants. But really, they are all so damn excited to see those gun Stocks go soaring after each one.
4348 2018-02-16 23:37:55 They obstruct at every turn. No assault rifles, limited clips, bump stocks, background checks for ALL gun sales. Mental health? No they say. The status quo is NOT acceptable.

O, has your dad paid all fed taxes he owes? The back rent? Did that money end up in a trust for you?
4349 2018-02-16 23:37:49 @SenTedCruz It's not about Democrats or the Second Amendment, you IDIOT! It's about gun control and getting assault rifles/bump stocks off the streets. Don't think anyone wants to take hunters' guns away. But you represent an open-carry state. So, Ted, do u really know anything?
4350 2018-02-16 23:37:38 Though they DID make fully automatic bump stocks LEGAL in 2010.
4351 2018-02-16 23:37:36 The problem is the scumbags that support the disgusting @NRA all over the delusional rights of the second amendment. We need a ban on all assault weapons, including bump stocks, and we need strict gun control laws, including collectors and gun shows.
4352 2018-02-16 23:37:13 ナイトでずいぶん上がったのね。
4353 2018-02-16 23:37:11 100% sure I have it all!  W-2, 1099’s, tax forms for stocks, and even charity donations 
4354 2018-02-16 23:36:54 You are in the NRA’s pocket. Care about the kids? Ban semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks.
4355 2018-02-16 23:36:31 The new law should be no semi-automatic weapons, no bump stocks, and definitely no automatic weapons. Hunters can go back to having to use rifles and if they suck at that, I know a grocery store where they can buy food.
4356 2018-02-16 23:35:30 You also have a right to prevent the sale of tools that help kill you faster, like bump stocks and silencers and military grade assault rifles
4357 2018-02-16 23:34:51 That's "BUMP STOCKS"...sorry for the typo in previous TWEET.  There may be more, please forgive.  It's not easy to be totally accurate when one is emotional!  BTW, the Parkland violence was NOT caused by FBI failures, eventhough they may have let it "fall through the cracks".....
4358 2018-02-16 23:34:45 You do know Obama administration made bump stocks legal don’t you?  2010 and 2012.
4359 2018-02-16 23:34:33 If a customer asks for help, we have to take them to the product and we're not allowed to leave them until we have placed the item in their hand. We HAVE to do that from now on, apparently. (Like fuck I will. No customer wants that!)
4360 2018-02-16 23:34:24 The point here is even keeping all weapons from people diagnosed with mental illness won't have a noticeable effect because most shooters aren't diagnosed with one. For me, it emphasizes why we need to just not have AR-15s and bump stocks in the hands of private citizens.
4361 2018-02-16 23:34:04 I'm honestly not sure, Zoe. Here's what comes to mind .
- Maybe a psych test of sorts? You're the Psychologist, what do you think?
- Raise the age requirement to 21.
- Eliminate "bump stocks" etc.

4362 2018-02-16 23:33:58 School shootings ARE a mental health issue....those against stringent background checks, trade show loop-holes, outlawing bump stocks, high capacity magazines and semi-automatic rifles clearly have mental issues!
4363 2018-02-16 23:33:49 Même les gentils non racistes vont devoir intégrer les 30% de stocks #étrangers et assumer leur transformation en #africains
4364 2018-02-16 23:33:36 Semi-automatic guns have been around for a very long time. These are not assault rifles. "AR" in "AR15" is "Amralite Rifle", the company who makes it.
Hunting rifles of wooden stocks etc are the same thing, no different. These are needed for protection from criminals & state!
4365 2018-02-16 23:32:44 No one is saying take away guns but there is no reason for AR-15 or bump stocks shouldn't be thast easily available . hence #CommonSenseGunLaws
4366 2018-02-16 23:32:10 @marcorubio So, what's holding up your making some new laws like banning bump stocks & other auto-fire conversion devices? Where's your move to ban weapons that are functionally no different from the illegal Tommy gun? No legit civilian use for them, right? Heller I,II,III.
4367 2018-02-16 23:32:10 Demand that Russian sanctions be enforced immediately. Bring us legislation banning the sale of all assault weapons and bump stocks. Impeach Trump when Mueller proves that he is a traitor.
4368 2018-02-16 23:32:05 We go for Appleloosa! The apples family stocks their weapons there after the war
4369 2018-02-16 23:32:04 `

All the ppl who were planning mass deaths in a shooting action are canceling their plans because they'll not have their bump stocks after they COMPLY and turn them in.

Because there is no law against murder that they need to comply with....., or something.

Foolish BS.
4370 2018-02-16 23:31:12 @SenTedCruz assault weapons, bump stocks, and AR-15's are weapons of mass murder. 80% of US does not want them.

4372 2018-02-16 23:30:05 It works as fast as you can pull the trigger or even faster (ie: bump stocks).
4373 2018-02-16 23:26:41 I said raise the age to 21. NRA said they should outlaw bump stocks, but when the bill was suppose to go through someone decided to add on other things to the bill, like always, so the bill was squashed.
4374 2018-02-16 23:26:30 why would hector listen to aftv?? biggest laughing stocks around
4375 2018-02-16 23:26:19 Lack of any moral base, and value of life are the problem. Schools, government, and laws are not.  This country needs to get back to parents teaching their children, not pushing it off on teachers to show kids how to live.  Education can’t teach right from wrong.
4376 2018-02-16 23:26:17 I hear they are still weak on bump stocks, want to make silencers legal and it easier to buy guns.   WTF??!!
4377 2018-02-16 23:24:17 ...by the NRA and the moronic far right gun lobby!   After the Vegas concert massacre, a bipartisan group of lawmakers presented a bill to ban "bumb stocks" which can make mass shootings vastly more lethal, but the legislation recently stalled after the NRA voiced......
4378 2018-02-16 23:24:00 that sucks
4379 2018-02-16 23:23:59 How about we *start with banning bump stocks & large magazines, requiring universal background checks at gun shows, & ending firearms buys by mentally-ill or domestic abusers? Talk is cheap. "Thoughts & prayers" have been ineffective thus far.
4380 2018-02-16 23:23:21 I doubt someone could murder 17 people with a Knife. We need background checks, mental health screenings and Ban ARs,Semi-Automatics, and bump stocks. That monster got his gun legally and that’s the problem The problem is bigger than guns but its better than doing nothing.
4381 2018-02-16 23:22:24 OMG !!! Next thing you know she ll be  Trading MJ stocks !
4382 2018-02-16 23:22:18 @GOP just tweeted "We're with you, Florida." I asked: " 'With you' ; 'thoughts & prayers'? Or 'banning bump stocks & large magazines, requiring universal background checks at gun shows, ending firearms buys by mentally-ill or domestic abusers?' What does "we're with you" mean?"
4383 2018-02-16 23:21:59 If bump stocks are a "joke" then why are you upset about Colorado outlawing them? Are you suggesting they need to do more?
4384 2018-02-16 23:21:40 #EconomyToday Mkt still looks to test high. Dollar back over 89DXY. Has to put all resource stocks and EM on notice . We see Tuesday .
4385 2018-02-16 23:21:03 @Frenkie_Fisch where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
4386 2018-02-16 23:20:02 @polishstocks where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
4387 2018-02-16 23:20:00 Biggest problem is second/third homes and buy-to-let mortgages. Decimated housing stocks in last 20years.
4388 2018-02-16 23:19:39 I think there are all kinds of restrictions people could live with eg bump stocks, armour piercing bullets, bullets that explode, assault rifles.
4389 2018-02-16 23:19:23 @sad_comrade There was no Bengal genocide. That's a lie. There were major crop failures in the area that caused a famine & it took some time to get surplus stocks from other parts of India. You clowns ignore that there was a World War going on at the time.
4390 2018-02-16 23:19:11 Shower thought: Relative changes of cryptocurrencies (and stocks) should be measured in dB instead of %.
4391 2018-02-16 23:18:58 1st week is over with purchasing stocks. Seeing what happens a month from now, currently up by 0.037%.
4392 2018-02-16 23:18:51 Wouldn’t it b MORE difficult to get a gun if we had 480,000 guns,not 480 million ?& if background checks were rigorous? & guns only sold through bonded stores?No gun shows?Multi round magazines,bump stocks, machined,assault rifles were banned?This IS solvable.But Congress=cowards
4393 2018-02-16 23:18:39 I know! So you need a Cafe that stocks boring white bread.
4394 2018-02-16 23:18:04 Where are you on a ban on bump stocks, enhanced background checks, & elimination of the Dickey amendment that stops CDC from using federal money to study gun violence?
4395 2018-02-16 23:16:46 Nor to insult your intelligence, how familiar with weapons are you? The term assault weapon is a bit of a misnomer. It is based on physical looks rather than function. As far as fully automatic weapons goes, or bump stocks, civilians have no need of those. Semi auto is fine IMO.
4396 2018-02-16 23:16:18 Too much time on those cockhands of yours
4397 2018-02-16 23:14:44 Availability of AR weapons and certain specs that can increase fire rate of normal weapons (ex. Bump stocks). Could get into a mag limit, but that's probably too much right away.
4398 2018-02-16 23:14:26 This is the cowardly response to every school shooting, and the NRA’s. founded on the idiotic logic that we would be safer with “more guns in the hands of the good guys”. That’s why gun manufacturers stocks go up after school shootings. It’s not about guns. Its about the money
4399 2018-02-16 23:14:01 "With you"; "thoughts & prayers"? Or banning bump stocks & large magazines, requiring universal background checks at gun shows, ending firearms buys by mentally-ill or domestic abusers? What does "we're with you" mean?
4400 2018-02-16 23:13:33 Right. You can’t end it.
1.) reinstate assault weapons ban
2.) universal background checks
3.) universal healthcare so people have access to mental health services
4.) magazine size limits, firing speed limits(bump stocks,etc)
Slow shooters down...
4401 2018-02-16 23:13:21 savings ? investment ? baka nasa stocks kaya d liquid gaya n ate sha :D ?
4402 2018-02-16 23:12:48 Well then lets work to ban ar15s, bump stocks, and high capacity clips. That's a start. Write to your legislators and ask them to support that. It's a start, on this we can agree. I'm glad we've found some common ground. #NeverAgain #keepourkidssafe
4403 2018-02-16 23:11:57 Very true and by the way, senate democrats many many middle class own stocks and get the same benefits!!!   Stop the class envy warfare.
4404 2018-02-16 23:10:58 Paprika Pringles stocks have fallen in recent years, not like the good old days! Level 2, Top 5 Street Signs ?
4405 2018-02-16 23:10:45 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
4406 2018-02-16 23:10:19 Let me stop you right there, one it's called a magazine, not a clip. Number 2: Read what I wrote, two things you wrote will never work. Number 3: Bump stocks are useless, they destroy your accuracy.
4407 2018-02-16 23:10:15 The #NRA should supply schools with ample Kevlar blankets if this country does nothing to change the ease of obtaining semi-auto rifles and bump stocks.
4408 2018-02-16 23:09:17 I’m not against common sense gun laws. I don’t think ar15s are necessary. I don’t like bump stocks. I don’t like huge capacity clips. Yes, mass shootings are down in those places but other crimes are up, like rape and burglary. It’s not a gun problem. It’s a people problem.
4409 2018-02-16 23:09:00 So funny that back then he was dealing with folks calling bubbles on tech stocks. Guess those skeptics have melted away now?
4410 2018-02-16 23:08:42 Jacks had a wine
4411 2018-02-16 23:07:48 $FRFS $ANDI $SRMX $MINE $DRWN $LDSR $BYOC $SGDH $FUSZ are just some of the stocks I’ve recently bought in the last 3+ months that I feel strongly about answer have long term capital gains potential
Got some of my clients in all of them as well. Loaded MINE BIGLY this week!
4412 2018-02-16 23:07:25 Hmmm...not sure I agree. Most mis pricing I have seen are between asset classes rather than in stocks (the investment world still operates in asset class silos). My team at JPM built model that beat fundamental research analysts picks using natural language and machine learning.
4413 2018-02-16 23:07:25 Ya I’m DIY all low cost index funds. Actually 100% stocks. No bonds but I have a DB pension.
4414 2018-02-16 23:06:44 Actually you are quite inaccurate. Prior to 1996 a person could own a full auto machine gun. And people still can as long they are grandfathered in. A Assault rifle is not illegal because it's Semi Auto! Sure you can ban bump stocks and only allow those with FBI clearance.
4415 2018-02-16 23:05:43 I think a move lower in yields and more grind before they crack 3% that everyone seems to be looking for…there’s def sellers higher in price but might be stretched down here in to month end (possible rotation from stocks as you said).
4416 2018-02-16 23:04:45 @realDonaldTrump   Assault weapons, and bump stocks SHOULD BE BANNED @ FEDERAL LEVEL!     2A supporter, Trump supporter.  No more dead kids.
4417 2018-02-16 23:04:14 Those Assault Rifles must be very profitable for Gun Shop Owners. Republicans are so contradictory. Their Right to Life platform loves bump stocks and guns more than health care and food for babies. They want citizens with mental health concerns to have guns but no health care.
4418 2018-02-16 23:04:11 Hi! I did not know u before this week NYDough & took few trades on stocks  i'm comfortable with. Clear EXIT signals helped a lot! Like!
4419 2018-02-16 23:03:23 The stocks are dropping, so thta means people are worried, the biz community thinks that Mueller looking to do somethign shady. Know this; If they ever did somehow manage to frame Trump, the economy would fall so hard, no one could ever piece it together. Not that liberals care.
4420 2018-02-16 23:02:27 A little of people rightly or wrongly in the fandom just look at the TF side of TRU, but the stock ordering/reducing old stocks needs sorted
4421 2018-02-16 23:01:11 Ban AR-15 and other assault style weapons, ban bumper stocks, ban oversized hand gun magazines of over 9 bullets.
4422 2018-02-16 23:01:06 Yeh making a separate twitter account to just tweet about stocks etc
4423 2018-02-16 23:00:56 that sucks u should of put at least that u were 18
4424 2018-02-16 23:00:52 If anybody know about stocks and shit hit me up I’m trying to invest in something
4425 2018-02-16 23:00:25 And she stocks her daytime show with #NeverTrumpers!  Between @DanaPerino and @theJuanWilliams, I've all but quit #TheFive.
4426 2018-02-16 23:00:24 A Republican running for Governor in Georgia gave out bump stocks after Las Vegas. There is no floor for their indecency.
4427 2018-02-16 22:59:21 I bet twitter stocks rise with the emergence of self driving cars.
4428 2018-02-16 22:58:25 Private citizens should NOT be able to buy an assault rifle. Bump stocks should be banned as well. Nobody wants to take your guns away BUT saying that sensible gun reform is NOT necessary is WRONG. Other Countries have proved this over and over. Stop ignoring FACTS !!!
4429 2018-02-16 22:58:13 The options are 1. zero salmon fishing, 2. catch and release, and 3. retention. At the moment retention isn't what the stocks can handle. I hope the stocks recover, but for now precautionary approach needed.
4430 2018-02-16 22:57:53 And how do high capacity magazines protect our kids?  I agree that the quote "assault rifle" is exactly the same as any semi-automatic rifle other than the looks.  But there is no justifiable use for high capacity magazines and bump-stocks .
4431 2018-02-16 22:57:33 Important to remember that several times in the last 150 years capital assets/bonds/stocks in major developed countries, both as a result of war and other causes, have experienced a correlated move to near zero. Similar outcomes from exogenous & endogenous shocks remain possible.
4432 2018-02-16 22:57:13 I'd give in on bump stocks (even though they aren't a big deal for safety except for that one time), but you want to require gun owners to get insurance?! That'll never happen, and it's an impossible ask.
4433 2018-02-16 22:57:09 Swami you should be paid to criticise overhyped stocks.
4434 2018-02-16 22:55:57 “FBI should be held accountable? Fire Wray, FBI Head???????”  Wow. It is YOUR state that is putting semi automatics and bump stocks in the hands  of CHILDREN to KILL CHILDREN. You need to be fired, then charged as an accomplice to murder.
4435 2018-02-16 22:55:02 I try to stay out of political discussions but this is just eating me alive. I am so angry that we keep letting these shootings happen. I am angry that parents won't even consider #guncontrol because their precious AR-15s and bump stocks are more important than their child's life
4436 2018-02-16 22:54:41 @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump @PRyan @JohnCornyn why are people on the terrorist watch list "NO FLY" list still allowed to buy assault weapons? Why have you not outlawed bump-stocks? #floridahighschoolshooting
4437 2018-02-16 22:54:27 Lol how hard you’re trying.  You’ve become laughing stocks twisting into gymnastic feats of improbability.  Garbage media.
4438 2018-02-16 22:54:18 #LON:INTU Discussion stirs around intu properties plc (LON:INTU) this week; here is what ... #stockmarket #business #time#investing #finance #money #cryptocurrency #market #bitcoin #stocks #trading #day #daytrading #year #pennystocks #opportunitieshttps://bzweekly.com/2018/0…
4439 2018-02-16 22:53:17 It's not a binary, black or white thing. Why are there over 200 million arms, semi-automatic weapons sold to - ANYONE? What happened to the ban on bump stocks? Why does the GOP refuse to even investigate HOW to curb the unnecessary death? It's not about taking your guns away.
4440 2018-02-16 22:52:19 Jacks had a beer
4441 2018-02-16 22:52:00 Correct, but it’s still assault-style weapon that with large capacity magazines and bump stocks - all legal - can slaughter masses of children in seconds.
4442 2018-02-16 22:52:00 Well, I’m not a “gun nut” by any means.  I would agree with you that there’s no place for bump stocks.  I think if we as a society can have a calm conversation w/out name calling, we could hopefully arrive at some positive solutions someday and save some of our precious children
4443 2018-02-16 22:51:43 We should bring back public stocks. Maybe Congresscritters would make better choices. Choose greed over people? When you get home, you're put in stocks while constituents pelt you w/garbage for every day you spent in DC. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization #NRABloodMoney #GOPComplicit
4444 2018-02-16 22:51:22 It’s the guns!!!!!! Give back your NRA $. Get rid of bump stocks, assault rifles, and don’t put guns in the hands of kids.
4445 2018-02-16 22:50:54 Mostly DIY. An IRA in Betterment. 90+% ETFs and a dash of individual stocks.
4446 2018-02-16 22:50:40 I had the exact same the other week...
4447 2018-02-16 22:49:22 I'm near that point too. The Haig Club was on offer at Tescos a few months ago so it's been the mixer whisky over xmas. Stocks in the house also low. Will go shopping on 28th
4448 2018-02-16 22:49:06 how are those investments in gun stocks treating you Zinke?
4449 2018-02-16 22:48:50 That’s cool. I’m DIY but robo advising is a great way to go for some people. Do mostly use one or the other? Do you use ETFs, mutual funds or individual stocks?
4450 2018-02-16 22:47:12 Their investments make $$$ when weapons + military are bought...raises stocks for companies like Raytheon who manufacture for MIC, example....Trump sent 42 ish missiles to bomb Syris air strip...each one cost $1M dollars to make....stocks rose when he sent them...he made money.
4451 2018-02-16 22:46:42 The ignorance of some Americans to be duped by marching & protesting. I hope those idiots used all their vacation, lost jobs & money by acting like fools. I sat back & watched my 401k & stocks increase. Ahh...
4452 2018-02-16 22:45:55 Let's not overreact. No one is coming for your guns nor hunting nor hobby. I own a gun & enjoy competition shooting. There are things we do not need like armor piercing rounds or bump stocks or extended magazines. We also do not need ppl with a history of violence to have access.
4453 2018-02-16 22:45:47 My thing is 90% of murders by gun are from handguns but you never see legislation for this. Just random butt stocks or custom mag bans that any hobbysist can get around
4454 2018-02-16 22:45:43 @RepAdamSchiff I was thinking if we raise the age from 18 for rifles and 20 for pistols to 24 yrs old and increase the background checks for assault rifles and bump stocks that will help and not offend the NRA or the gun lovers it makes people accountable
4455 2018-02-16 22:45:24 He (Stephen Paddock) didn’t have automatic rifles. He used “bump stocks” which should absolutely be illegal. There was also background checks done on him and there were no red flags. I don’t know what the solution is but we obviously need one.
4456 2018-02-16 22:45:23 Must buy that Porsche 911 Turbo and a few weed and bitcoin stocks.  After all, they always go up...
4457 2018-02-16 22:42:15 2) A mixture of stocks & bonds is generally safe bet. In a recent recession both stocks and bonds dropped like rocks. Some older people and retirees lost about ~1/3 of their “safe” investments. Although it came back, it didn’t make up for the investment income lost in ensuing yrs
4458 2018-02-16 22:42:01 Same thing as that ice tea beverage company that changed its name to include blockchain and saw its stocks jump.. #crazy
4459 2018-02-16 22:41:23 @jjeffrose hey bro love your channel - your opinion would you rather have individual stocks and/or a Roth IRA or you had to choose one. Thanks and love your work
4460 2018-02-16 22:38:21 1)Years ago, I was totally in favor of giving people their own retirement accounts instead of Social Security. I’m not so sure now. Generally, when stocks go up, bonds go down, when stocks go down bonds go up.
4461 2018-02-16 22:35:43 What can Trump and Congress do now in response to shooting: Ban Bump Stocks, Ban Assault Rifles, Raise age for purchasing weapons, enact universal background checks!
#ParklandSchoolShooting
4462 2018-02-16 22:35:29 So...Your logic is “people are killing each other in Chicago so let’s not do anything about access to assault rifles and bump stocks?”
4463 2018-02-16 22:34:45 Stocks from "deep below" are coming up to meet my liquidity filter. Mostly I haven't heard of them. Like $trup
4464 2018-02-16 22:34:38 Don't Blame Guns, cars, knives, bump stocks the internet or any other object.

BLAME 
SSRI's, AL-QAEDA, FBI, CIA, fake news & Faux Liberals.
4465 2018-02-16 22:34:06 It's all computer bullsh*t. Like playing Vegas with algorithms. No intrinsic value to stocks anymore.

4471 2018-02-16 22:33:49 When I think about assault I think about automatic weapons.. not semi automatics. A gun shoots as fast as you can pull the trigger BUT cos is bump stocks that’s another story.
4472 2018-02-16 22:33:48 If you can’t get behind the banning of guns, fine. But there are things you can get behind. Such as bills that prevent terrorists from buying assault rifles, or bills that prevent the sale of bump stocks, and many more because currently congress is voting against those things.
4473 2018-02-16 22:33:41 LAST??? BITCH IM BROKE I NEED RE STOCKS OR NEW MERCH ATLEAST IN LIKE 6 MONTHS
4474 2018-02-16 22:33:23 I want to get this clear that while I support 2A, I believe there needs to be mandatory safety/storage training, better background checks, bump stocks should be illegal, no-one needs a rifle except for hunters and handguns are enough for home/self defense. rechecks for training
4475 2018-02-16 22:32:40 The Co-op stocks it.
4476 2018-02-16 22:32:27 Ha bet you sold all your stocks too
4477 2018-02-16 22:31:55 I agree with the magazines over 30 rounds, that's about standard. Bump stocks are illegal in most states, but you can make one using a belt so that only does so much. It's a good step, but it does more to ease people's minds than to solve a problem

4481 2018-02-16 22:31:29 Man, your argument is ridiculous. It MATTERS when dozens of people are shot in a public place. Fucks sake! Keep your bloody guns but be responsible enough to have background checks and limits on extended mags and bump stocks.
4482 2018-02-16 22:30:11 Hmmm why would it be necessary to mandate insurance if you enforced rigorous background checks and banned assault rifles and bump stocks? Wouldnt insurance be superfluous if those regs were rigorously enforced?
4483 2018-02-16 22:29:53 Pass never mattered mate he was locked and loaded  yeah that’ll be nice, just looking at that pitch makes me cringe
4484 2018-02-16 22:29:47 1. Right, and the AR-15s aren't illegal because you have to pull the trigger every time you shoot. Bump stocks do away with that pesky problem
4485 2018-02-16 22:29:33 Another evidence free claim...you long on gun stocks?
4486 2018-02-16 22:28:54 True'd up production dropped, and the demand dropped to well above normal from way above normal.  Context matters.  Stocks continue to -, and demand continues to +, from a macro perspective.  Ur making a macro projection, using unweighted micro data.  Your $, your choice.

4488 2018-02-16 22:27:09 y'all be out here buying individual stocks? my anxiety is rising just thinking about it!
4489 2018-02-16 22:26:55 There’s nothing in second amendment stopping us from banning AR-15s and high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  Many guns banned now. Ban this one too.
4490 2018-02-16 22:26:22 Showjumping clearly the most chilled of Equestrian sports, no? Don’t bother plaiting, enter on the day, bling? Full ya boots. Too hot? Take off your jacket! No stocks required. I do like that approach.
4491 2018-02-16 22:26:06 You can hold individual stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and more within a Roth IRA it's not a one or the other question

4497 2018-02-16 22:24:16 @MinorityMinds @RyanOScribner would like to know both your options would you recommend to have  individual stocks and/or Roth IRA or both. Thanks for the answer
4498 2018-02-16 22:23:01 If your intention is to ban assault rifles and bump stocks, I am sure the students there would love to hear it. They want that, improved security and metal detectors. Platitudes will likely be unsatisfactory to them.

4500 2018-02-16 22:22:00 Please please please please wise up... bump stocks didn't do the damage in this last massacre.  It was the Automatic Rifle.  While these stocks should be banned the AR's are not protected by the constitution. @MorningJoe

4502 2018-02-16 22:20:53 The right-wing hypocrisy is exactly this:
RW: "The assault weapons ban was stupid because it addressed cosmetic features like folding stocks."
Me: "OK, let's address functions that facilitate mass shootings, and ban semi-autos with removable magazines."
RW: "Oh no no no no no."
4503 2018-02-16 22:20:51 @StocksExchangeR could you announce BTW is listed at Stocks? So many people did not know it
4504 2018-02-16 22:20:51 I think his specialty is that how much you can make her pay for making mistakes has always been a huge attribute on a characters potential to beat her. Fox is fast enough to punish a lot of things many characters cant, and does damage/takes stocks very efficiently.
4505 2018-02-16 22:20:47 No worries! But I should clarify, the site did all the legwork for us. I'm not super well versed, but believe you look up individual funds in your 401K account, then use site to see if contains gun co stocks. Open ? as to whether ANY Vanguard funds exclude gun stocks though...
4506 2018-02-16 22:19:27 bump stocks work by using the recoil of the gun to slide the trigger into one’s finger to fire individual rounds at an advanced rate. they malfunction often forcing one to reset their grip. thus they don’t truly turn a firearm into “fully automatic”.

4515 2018-02-16 22:14:54 And also again, gun control does not equal banning guns. Background checks, longer waiting periods, and the banning of bump stocks in no way violates your second amendment rights
4516 2018-02-16 22:14:23 Stockbrokers allowed customers to buy stocks on the margin, meaning that they paid for it in many increments. This partially caused the Great Depression since when the stock market crashed customers were unable to repay their debts and their stocks were now worthless. #histry
4517 2018-02-16 22:14:00 Yes I have a 401K match to 3%. IRA that is maxed to $5500 for individual. What do you think about buying individual stocks? I am applying for my #MBA @Wharton fall 2019
4518 2018-02-16 22:13:59 I have the right to own a silencer, ammunition clips that hold 50 or more bullets, bump stocks, a gun that will fire 45 bullets in a minute. Is this what the writers of and the legislators that passed the 2nd Amendment had in mind? Did they have the ability to see this? NO!
4519 2018-02-16 22:13:49 Absolutely. All assault weapons and bump stocks should be outlawed.

4522 2018-02-16 22:13:29 I’m not advocating for complete eradication of gun rights. That’s about a thousand steps past asking for background checks at gun shows. Or banning AR-15s. Or banning citizen use of bump stocks.

4525 2018-02-16 22:12:24 The FBI messed up. Bigger issue is how many madmen the FBI is supposed to save us from and/ or predict who will go on next killing spree with assault weapons, AR-15s, bump stocks, magazines. Remove the weapons and the FBI success rate sure to improve

4529 2018-02-16 22:11:17 Oh, right... of course... the penny finally drops. Because this being just semi automatic w/ optics, 30 round magazines, bump-stocks, etc. must make them perfectly safe for responsible, god fearing folk to own, and everyone within range of them.

4531 2018-02-16 22:11:08 Bump stocks are legal in lots of states. Ever seen one in action?
4532 2018-02-16 22:11:07 It's not stripping rights. It's enforcing sensible gun regulations. 

Why do gun owners need semi-automatic assault rifles? Why do they need extended mags, bump stocks, and suppressors?

Those are by for hunting, not for sport, they are overcompensations for delicate egos.

4538 2018-02-16 22:08:51 Assault style weapons and bump stocks should be banned.
4539 2018-02-16 22:08:40 No they’re not. What happened to bump stocks? It’s just the constant spin cycle that you and Republicans do whenever there is a mass shooting. You are co-conspirators in this epidemic. deal with it

4546 2018-02-16 22:06:17 No, see, you're wrong. The cost of keeping the leader of the Free world has, and always will be, high. Plus Trump has more property to watch, that's the cost of Presidents.

4555 2018-02-16 22:04:09 @RepTomGraves @SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue Add to your to-do list: Bring back the assault weapons ban and add bump stocks to banned items. Pass protection for DACA recipients. Remind yourselves to always place country before party and people before campaign cash.

4579 2018-02-16 21:56:18 Why have we not banned bump stocks yet?
4580 2018-02-16 21:55:58 I don't pretend to have all of the answers or to be a gun expert. But the AR-15 seems to be the most commonly used in these types of shootings. And something clearly needs to be done. Things like bump stocks should be a no brainer. What do you think should be done?
4581 2018-02-16 21:55:31 B.S., you haven't even done anything to ban bump stocks since Vegas.  I hope one of those parents spits in your ugly orange face.

4585 2018-02-16 21:54:21 True, I have done that about gun control...I intend to about bump stocks because I just learned about them today. I admit there is a lot I don't know or understand
4586 2018-02-16 21:54:19 I have no problem with the ban of AR-15 and bump stocks. But please leave my 2nd amendment rights alone. Oh but yes, raise the age of legal gun buying and put mental health and police calls into a data base to flag the gun buying  background checks.
4587 2018-02-16 21:54:01 Reminder: The NRA spends tens of millions annually to prevent things like comprehensive background checks, keeping firearms out of the hands of mentally ill people, keeping bump stocks legal etc.  But nice try Joe.  Nice try.

4590 2018-02-16 21:48:29 all semi automatic or ar-15 style guns should have separate laws, should be distinguished from other rifles or long guns such as shot guns. Bump stocks should be banned. Ultimately the ar-15 must be modified to prevent being converted to fully auto, it's too easy, or banned

4593 2018-02-16 21:47:17 But common sense legislation is needed, we can't stop demanding it and trees
Yes bump stocks need to be restricted too
4594 2018-02-16 21:47:05 Yes Rep Swalwell. Ban them. 1. Bam all assault weapons-no quibbling about rim shots etc. 2. Bam bump stocks. 3 Reinstate Obama mental health provision 4. Ban unlimited purchase of ammo. 5. Require insurance on guns same as cars
4595 2018-02-16 21:46:16 There are plenty of things that can be done. Like not allowing terrorists to buy guns, making sure that the people who are buying guns are well trained to use them, elimating the sale of guns and accessories like silencers and bump stocks that are not used in hunting or defense
4596 2018-02-16 21:46:05 Justice will definitely prevail at the gate. Over $3 million worth of justice. If you want a slim chance to get re-elected, you'd better support gun control now. Assault weapons should be illegal as well as bump stocks. Grow a pair and do something!!!
4597 2018-02-16 21:45:53 Accessories like bump stocks
4598 2018-02-16 21:45:19 Bump stocks are banned, and what is a "high capacity" magazine, please expand on the "etc" aswel, legitimately curious
4599 2018-02-16 21:44:56 Cheers, Richard. Useful info and there's a store nearby that stocks both.
4600 2018-02-16 21:43:55 Reminder: 80% of America supports expanded background checks and other "common sense" regulation, yet ZERO action. Bump stocks, which only exist to make guns fire faster - Not banned after Vegas. If youblock EVERYTHING, the only choice left for gun control will be banning guns.

4603 2018-02-16 21:43:41 My stocks did alright in the sell off.  LOL> Just kidding. I'm a teacher. Socks? I have some of those. Stocks? LOL.  ah, good one.
4604 2018-02-16 21:43:29 Proof of how easily persuadable Fox News viewers are, that this tired, ridiculous line is still being trotted out. Can we talk about vegas yet?  And your failure to ban bump stocks?
4605 2018-02-16 21:43:11 Quote of the week... Don't look at the indices,don't look at the Nasdaq, look at your stocks. They will tell you everything you need to know. The leaders will not be holding key levels.
4606 2018-02-16 21:42:01 Since it’s inappropriate to talk about #ParklandFlorida right now, we ready to talk about #1October and bump stocks yet?

Fuck everyone who says “it’s too early” to talk about #GunReform
4607 2018-02-16 21:41:13 The Wilshire 5000 index, the broadest measure of U.S. stocks  closed the day about flat but was up about 4.3 percent for the week.
4608 2018-02-16 21:40:29 “How happy are you that you’re at baseball right now?” - @EmilyPiver 
Is that a real question?
4609 2018-02-16 21:40:22 Oh it’s not blurry at all. Bump stocks should be illegal imo.
4610 2018-02-16 21:40:03 Dump your stocks People and close all accounts!! Hurt that pocketbook!!

4612 2018-02-16 21:39:30 Yes a lot of stocks have hard to borrow rates...
4613 2018-02-16 21:39:21 @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @PRyan @RepMcCaul @SenateMajLdr Why can people on the terrorist watch list still legally buy a gun? Why has Congress failed to outlaw bump-stocks for auto fire assault weapons? (Vegas shooting didn't sway you on this one?) #FloridaShooting
4614 2018-02-16 21:39:01 And if course he warned us of the sell off the last time he was interviewed. I wd love fir CNBC to show that tape. I have a feeling was something like this: " of course we will correct at some point, 5-10%, a healthy pullback, but I would buy because long term stocks go up"
4615 2018-02-16 21:38:05 John she’s absolutely wrong. She should come and live in Massachusetts and Connecticut,we have very strict gun laws. We are about outlaw bump stocks. This is what the right does, they point out cities that have high crime, never pointing out that they boarder states with lax laws
4616 2018-02-16 21:37:54 Buy stocks
4617 2018-02-16 21:37:48 DOW and S&P 500 closed slightly up, Nasdaq closed slightly down for the day. All in all a very strong week on Wall Street.

4619 2018-02-16 21:37:38 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-15, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (3/6):
4620 2018-02-16 21:36:52 The top five stocks that fell today were $VFC. $UAA ( $UA ), $VMC, $CBOE, and $CHK.
4621 2018-02-16 21:35:45 The top five stocks that gained today were $CMG, $NUE, $HII, $KIM, and $VRSN.
4622 2018-02-16 21:35:43 on what? More guns to the people? Arming the scools? Every kid should have in just case? Selling semi automatics and bump stocks in the same store? Ah, no, they're doing that already, I forgot...
4623 2018-02-16 21:35:34 Poked a little $VXX into the close on top of the $SPY from yesterday's close. You can all plan for stocks to rocket higher on Tuesday!
4624 2018-02-16 21:35:27 Asset is an item with economic value that an individual or organization owns, such as stocks, real estate, personal property, and business equipment.
4625 2018-02-16 21:35:16 Indeed. From 7pm. Until stocks last etc...
4626 2018-02-16 21:35:13 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $MU, $AMD, and $F.
4627 2018-02-16 21:35:05 No civilian needs a semi-automatic rifle either. This is, like I said, semantics. Additionally, when modified with bump stocks like the shooter in Vegas, the line between semi-auto and fully-auto gets blurry.
4628 2018-02-16 21:35:00 Free cash flow: in other words cash you don’t need for anything else and therefore you can invest in stocks.
4629 2018-02-16 21:34:31 I am a private investor that takes medium to long term positions in stocks. Happy to share ideas w tm members. @TickerMonkey
4630 2018-02-16 21:34:27 Only do it when you’re ready bud, really easy to do a crazy load of money. Reality is I’m awful at it in general, let emotions/tilt get in the way. Should really stick to finding undervalued AIM stocks but it’s Friday night and I fancied a punt 
4631 2018-02-16 21:34:19 Best week since Hector was a pup. Dow up 4.2% best since Nov, 2016; S&P up 4.3% best since January, 2016 and Nasdaq up 5.3%  best since Dec, 2011.  Following today's close, the Dow is down 5.2% from its peak. Just a week ago today, stocks at daily low down 12.2% from the peak.
4632 2018-02-16 21:34:18 Obsessed with the stock market and trading, I want to become a day trader! #stock #market #daytrader #trade #stocks #penny
4633 2018-02-16 21:34:17 What a fantastic week. $BDR $FTI
$QQ $GGS $CRU thanks to @BigRig_Trader for bringing that last one to my attention yesterday. All of these stocks traded much higher in a more challenging market
4634 2018-02-16 21:34:12 Right.  Ban semi automatics and bump stocks - they weren't always legal.  Get metal detectors at schools, improve mental healthcare.  Common sense, rather than do nothing.
4635 2018-02-16 21:33:10 @binks @crazylarry i am. i twit about stocks and options. that are profitable. such a scammer.
4636 2018-02-16 21:32:44 Interestingly, stocks such as $NVAX $SSTI and $AQMS are working for me on the long side, but stocks like $R $MYGN are working on the down side.  That's why I let the action of my stocks be the main guide and not get pigeonholed into a way of thinking.

4639 2018-02-16 21:29:06 Make sure gun mfrs. are not in your 401K, Always wondered how many members of Congress own gun stocks. Ban the fucking bullets, if you won't ban guns.
4640 2018-02-16 21:28:47 As the mkt is stuck in this no-man's land, I advise taking it easy. Take a break, let yourself mentally reset, and let stocks reset for the next move.
4641 2018-02-16 21:28:24 "Child lock requirements" OOOOOORRRRRRR ya know, USE THE DAMN SAFETY???
Domestic abuse offenders are already denied guns.
"Bump Stocks" and stocks are the same thing.
There are already license requirements.
4642 2018-02-16 21:27:06 @Top_Sergeant Since my Congressman, #RepBrianMast, has yet to respond to my tweets begging for sensible legislation to outlaw bump stocks, repeal HJ Res 40, and ban private ownership of assault weapons, perhaps he might be more receptive to you. Thanks. #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
4643 2018-02-16 21:27:03 Won't be the first time and I'm sure it won't be the last brother, it also shows you can trade stocks and make money and never have to tweet them > 
4644 2018-02-16 21:26:52 Why can people on the terrorist No Fly list still legally buy a gun in USA?  Why can you still buy bump stocks to make assault weapons illegally automatic weapons (like in Las Vegas)?

Why haven't you signed executive orders to address these issues?
4645 2018-02-16 21:26:42 Ideal time to cut your Cash Positioning, Shift the funds from weak stocks to far more qualities stocks and probable Wealth creators...

Learnings unlimited with every phases.
4646 2018-02-16 21:26:09 I’m sure all 3 are heavily invested in related stocks...making while innocent people are assassinated.  So very American 
4647 2018-02-16 21:25:51 BTW, thank you for letting me know of the confirmed o/s. It could get interesting with any updates from the company.
4648 2018-02-16 21:25:50 It’s really sad. I met a few people within our leadership (some Military) who are well lettered. It is always fun to have a rich dialogue with them where ideology and superior argument rules. Unfortunately these stocks are not considered for leadership but the blatantly obtuse.
4649 2018-02-16 21:25:47 How do you feel about automatic and semi-automatic and bump stocks?
4650 2018-02-16 21:25:16 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-15, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
4651 2018-02-16 21:25:15 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-15, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
4652 2018-02-16 21:24:50 What is your position on banning bump stocks & sale of high cap. assault rifles-Words are empty unless accompanied by action.
4653 2018-02-16 21:24:29 Abortion is legal. False equivalency. 

I propose the mentally ill or violent offenders are not able to purchase firearms. Stricter gun laws...ar-15 like rifles have no business being in the hands of a private citizen. No semi automatic guns, no bump stocks.
4654 2018-02-16 21:24:29 Isn't that illegal?, buying stocks when you know what the outclome will be inthe future?.
4655 2018-02-16 21:24:03 Yet US stocks didn't blink. Is Trump's impeachment already priced into the market?
4656 2018-02-16 21:24:03 As you shout 
“There are no solutions I love to shout”

Why are you against banning assault weapons?
Or Bump Stocks?
4657 2018-02-16 21:23:47 Stocks like this are what give investing a bad wrap and why people refer to Wall Street as a “casino” if you are silly enough to buy into something like this you deserve more than a 33% drop
4658 2018-02-16 21:23:37 Bum stocks aren't weapons. Their an attachment! Would you have felt better if this kid had pulled the fire alarm and when everyone was outside ran them over! This isn't about guns this is about why a new generation thinks this violence is ok. This was never heard of 20 years ago.
4659 2018-02-16 21:22:57 You can buy armor piercing rounds but "blue lives matter". Battered girlfriends get shot due to the boyfriend loophole. & bum stocks are still legal even after Vegas. We regulate everything else why not this?
4660 2018-02-16 21:22:39 I agree with getting bump stocks and large magazines off the streets. That just makes things into a basic war machine.
4661 2018-02-16 21:22:24 Let's get the sale of ak47 & Ar15 and the Ammo to only law enforcement and not to general public. When retired return the rifle. Military included.Also ban bump stocks to public
4662 2018-02-16 21:22:14 S&P 500 gives up most of its gains to finish fractionally higher in sizzling week Stocks stumble late
The S&P 500 closed 1 point higher to 2732 after trading in a range of 2725-2754. Notably, the close is just above the intraday high on February 7, in what's a small technica…
4663 2018-02-16 21:22:13 Unlike most of them, I don't sell anything to the public. Have never been called out before, Didn't even  it sounded unrealistic.  They have had me on to discuss horrible positions on days those stocks blew up. The whole world knows I'm long GE. Our job is to try to buy the dip.
4664 2018-02-16 21:22:13 banning AR-15's, longer waiting periods, mental health checks, no private sales, no bump stocks or extended cartridges would be a very sensible start...
4665 2018-02-16 21:22:08 UK Market Close: Stocks end higher, tracking early gains on Wall Street
4666 2018-02-16 21:21:59 Since my Congressman, #RepBrianMast, has yet to respond to my tweets begging for sensible legislation to outlaw bump stocks, repeal HJ Res 40, and ban private ownership of assault weapons, perhaps he might be more receptive to you. Thanks for your service. #NeverAgain #parkland
4667 2018-02-16 21:21:37 My snaccage stocks are really plummeting in 2018
4668 2018-02-16 21:21:35 Enforce background checks, reinstate assault weapon ban, no bump stocks, no high-capacity magazines, no armor piercing ammunition, 7 day waiting period. This is nothing new. Simply common sense. #SafetyFirst
4669 2018-02-16 21:20:42 AND ban AR-15, bomb stocks, large capacity magazines. NO ONE needs or uses them for hunting or protection. They are used for killing a large amount of people.
4670 2018-02-16 21:20:42 Kinda like bump stocks? Your words are meaningless!
4671 2018-02-16 21:20:05 It was Obuma that allowed those bump stocks in play!  he approved it so they can stop blaming Trump for that one!
4672 2018-02-16 21:19:08 Bump stocks high capacity magazines etc
4673 2018-02-16 21:18:28 Next week this should go!
4674 2018-02-16 21:16:16 Massachusetts just made bump stocks illegal, maybe other states should too
4675 2018-02-16 21:15:38 So you are going to promote banning bump stocks and Ak-47’s, and advise limiting gun sales to violent individuals and people with mental disabilities?
Oh wait, that’s what #thoughtsandprayers are for, right? 
Heartache all the way to the water’s edge of the gods at the NRA. 
4676 2018-02-16 21:15:33 Finally. A voice of reason. Thank God he didn’t have a bump stock to turn that semi automatic into a full automatic rifle. We’d be in Vegas mass shooting territory with the number of casualties. Bump stocks were supposed to be banned after Vegas. That lost steam & never happened.
4677 2018-02-16 21:15:17 An odd finish to a terrific week. Dow and S&P up modestly while Nasdaq faded.  Breadth 1.4 and 1.2 to 1.  Stocks all over the map, finally stabilizing in wake of Ruskies with no Yank help messing with our election.
4678 2018-02-16 21:15:10 Yep agree 100% and the thing is even the guns argument is relative hunting rifles etc vs AR 15s, bump stocks etc
4679 2018-02-16 21:15:00 As usual, thanks for the updates 

Anyone out there playing cannabis stocks and not following @CanadaPotstocks is at a disadvantage right out of the gate.
4680 2018-02-16 21:15:00 To say that 90% of Americans want to take away guns entirely is just simply not true. Banning bump stocks is not taking away your guns. Requiring background checks isn’t taking away your guns. Not allowing known terrorists to buy guns is also not taking away your guns
4681 2018-02-16 21:13:54 World stocks ex US higher: Europe +1.1%; US +.04%. S&P 500 at 2732. I've forecasted a 2018 close between 2780 & 2904 & I still believe that's correct. Expect significant volatility but barring a collapse in the US government, the economy & earnings will persevere & move stocks up
4682 2018-02-16 21:13:35 In light of the developments and you liberals penchant for stupidity I am increasing my portfolio with whisky and vodka stocks. I figure with all the excessive drinking of you libs it is a sure winner. MAGA!
4683 2018-02-16 21:13:28 Trump won’t impose sanctions.  Sounds like an excellent time to buy Russian stocks.
4684 2018-02-16 21:13:27 I argued that for a long time too. I'm not buying it anymore. I'm for universal background checks, 5-day waiting periods, & a ban on high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, and assault weapons. I'm also for additional mental health services, guards as needed, etc. Enough is enough.
4685 2018-02-16 21:13:24 Human facts don't matter. avoid GSE Systems $GVP #Stocks
4686 2018-02-16 21:13:09 Why must we make it mandatory for that? I am not advocating that guns be banned. I am advocating for meaningful and effective reform that makes it difficult/impossible for these kinds of events to happen. AR-15s are not hunting rifle. We don't need bump stocks and extended clips.
4687 2018-02-16 21:13:09 Geeze, we couldn't get bump stocks banned after Las Vegas. Republicans don't care for human lives, just about money.
4688 2018-02-16 21:12:57 Cars are constantly regulated and made safer..seat belts, air bags, head rests, auto brakes. The assault weapons make changes to make them MORE deadly..higher calibers, bump stocks, etc
4689 2018-02-16 21:12:56 I wanna purchase stocks. How do I do that and which ones do I get
4690 2018-02-16 21:12:54 Folks it doesn't matter if any law is 100% effective in this area, there is ONLY a chance that fewer people get access to AR 15 Rifles, Bump Stocks, or Big Mags if you restrict them...and what is the cost? You don't get to use a tricked out AR-15....so what?
4691 2018-02-16 21:12:35 how high can the market go when people buy stocks based on a good economy (not just QE and buybacks)

or is a good economy when we start selling?
4692 2018-02-16 21:12:32 In the 2015-2016 election cycle alone, GOP candidates took $17,385,437 from the NRA. This does not include the $21 million donated to President Trump during the same period. If it's not about guns, why so much given to protect the NRA positions on Bump Stocks and assault rifles?
4693 2018-02-16 21:12:07 This is not stocks. Bitcoin is an asset. None of the others are...
4694 2018-02-16 21:11:17 Breaking: Cyberhair biomod stocks up be 300%
4695 2018-02-16 21:10:59 So Trump stocks in Russia tumbled also?
4696 2018-02-16 21:10:36 Do you think it can still run? Thanks
4697 2018-02-16 21:10:33 PASS legislation that takes AR 15’s and bump stocks and high density magazines out of the market!  Stop it!  Why is this difficult?  If you do not think voters are noticing this - you are mistaken.
4698 2018-02-16 21:09:55 Every market is different. Contrarian trading is much better than trend following in the stock market. Too many whipsaws kill trend followers in stocks

4701 2018-02-16 21:08:24 What a brutal day in MMJ ...had there been no Tech stocks in my portfolio....long weekend would have been really difficult for me to enjoy. 

Proportionate allocation and adjustments in different sectors has always helped me in days like this.

Old fashioned approach still works!
4702 2018-02-16 21:08:11 P.S. Just was reminded...China closed through WEDS for Year of the Dog celebrations.  Hope you sold your dog stocks today!  ;)  Nikkei open.
4703 2018-02-16 21:08:03 Stricter regulations on purchasing arms, get rid of all the loopholes. Ban bump stocks, stricter regulations on rifles w/ clips larger than 5 rounds, tighter restrictions on ar-15s since they seem to be the shooters weapon of choice.
4704 2018-02-16 21:07:53 The company that makes bump stocks had a very profitable year last year due to the Las Vegas shootings. How’s that for creepy?

4708 2018-02-16 21:07:12 Of course there weren't mass shootings, semiautomatic rifles with bump stocks and large capacity magazines were not available.
4709 2018-02-16 21:06:56 $HMNY weird day- risk is off. Pot stocks also not going higher ...
4710 2018-02-16 21:06:41 Same here. Good luck on your trading
4711 2018-02-16 21:06:20 50% growth on “low revs,” huh? 11.76bil with 50% YoY turns into $200bil in 2024. On stocks without dividend you’re investing where you think the company will go, not where it is.
4712 2018-02-16 21:05:20 Bump stocks should be illegal, and we need to actually enforce laws we have effectively which we haven't been doing. And I wish people would stop saying the US should do what small countries(population and amount of guns) have done to lower gun violence. Sadly we have more guns
4713 2018-02-16 21:05:14 Florida proposes 14 yo students be able to legally purchase AR-15's w/bump stocks as a partial remedy to 18 yo allowed to legally purchase same. One lawmaker wished to tack on legal purchase of grenades by 12 yo students to defend against older students

4716 2018-02-16 21:04:46 Then get busy and enact some gun laws to prevent another school shooting. No more AR-15 no more bump stocks no high capacity magazines #SendBackNRABloodMoney #StopNRASponsoredTerrorism #VoteOutNRASupporters
4717 2018-02-16 21:04:40 Get ready America! The Wall Street stocks "Cake walk" scam is setting up for the "music" to end. As usual, small investors, retirees will be left "without a seat!"
4718 2018-02-16 21:04:05 Wow, market used up all of its Viagra trying to get it up to 2745. If the $ has bottomed stocks are in big trouble, and gold. That was an ugly close IMO
4719 2018-02-16 21:03:09 Scam. Keep your Ltc.
4720 2018-02-16 21:02:55 That they have done to us, what the U.S. has done in other countries elections is interesting.  Wondering how social media stocks will fair after today; MSN & CNN having a collective melt down.

4725 2018-02-16 21:00:58 Breaking (4:00 PM EST): Stocks close higher, post best weekly gain since 2013... -- CNBC
4726 2018-02-16 21:00:36 People are desperately selling their  shares to stronger hands and that's what exactly happening $THDS.
4727 2018-02-16 21:00:31 Headed into the close with my screen half green/half red of the stocks/ETF's I follow. And $SPY is flat. +0.00%.
4728 2018-02-16 21:00:20 Great maybe you can ring it in next week by de-listing penny blockchain stocks like $RIOT and $LFIN!  Longfin loves showing off their NASDAQ open bell photos...since that appears to be all the substance there is. Normal for stocks to Slo-mo crash? Good talk. Stop listing crap.
4729 2018-02-16 21:00:04 I LOVE holding quality stocks over long weekends. $LG.v should be set for take off next week. Been waiting a while on this one
4730 2018-02-16 20:59:43 Let's face it, if we didn't have the 2nd amendment, we wouldn't have a gun issue. We wouldn't have assault weapons, we wouldn't have bump stocks, we wouldn't have ghost guns, we wouldn't have gun worship.
4731 2018-02-16 20:58:39 LOL, going back to the car argument huh? Cars are constantly regulated and made safer..seat belts, air bags, head rests, auto brakes. The assault weapons make changes to make them MORE deadly..higher calibers, bump stocks, etc.
4732 2018-02-16 20:58:31 Ban silencers, Bump Stocks, and AR-15s to the public  @RoyBlunt
4733 2018-02-16 20:58:25 YES!  Along with attachments that facilitate faster killing,hi cap mags, bump stocks etc.
4734 2018-02-16 20:58:05 I know brett/robodumpling also had a corazon charm but it’s also a while back so i dunno if he stocks it either. CRIES. MAKES MY OWN GOTDANG CORAZON MERCH. But also no, i will check them out
4735 2018-02-16 20:57:39 I’m sticking to my 100 Million you do know that’s it’s cheaper to buy on an exchange don’t you???
4736 2018-02-16 20:57:22 Simple question, why does anyone need an Armalite 15 Rifle, Bump Stocks, or large mags? Why are any of them worth preserving when restricting access could reduce casualties at Mass Shootings?
4737 2018-02-16 20:57:07 Bump stocks are cool but i dont really argree with them

4739 2018-02-16 20:55:25 I believe 100m old pac= 1 masternode
4740 2018-02-16 20:55:10 Nobody says make every gun illegal but surely there are some types we can and order they be returned or bought back from the gov for period of time. After that period possession is automatic jail time. We should also outlaw possession of certain accessories ie bump stocks
4741 2018-02-16 20:55:05 Sorry, the "common man" commits gun crimes too! They get guns legally. Plus total gun CONTROL does NOT mean take your guns away. Gun control means background checks, bump stocks & AR15 +..tell us why any common man needs these please?
4742 2018-02-16 20:54:15 @Rich_Motivation sir u r my ideal in business and real life. i need ur help to start my own investing firm particularly investing in stocks-commodities-forex & crypto currencies etc.
4743 2018-02-16 20:53:59 J'ai utilisé le site plusieurs fois. Le seul "défaut", c'est les délais. Tu recevras bien tes Pop!, super bien conditionnées, mais le délai est long.
Les mecs prennent toutes les réservations et gèrent leurs stocks après. Donc ils sont souvent en réapprovisionnement. 1/2
4744 2018-02-16 20:53:52 Yes, sadly thst is probably correct; but the ones that were just behind him for the tax break and stocks boom may be waking up a little.
4745 2018-02-16 20:53:19 Basically he needs to see the S&P with a good close above 2763 to become less bearish. He has been calling for years for a bear market to start in late 2017. He believes the top of the market was reached in January 2018 and stocks will go down until 2020
4746 2018-02-16 20:53:14 Normally I would agree with you but I think we have reached a tipping point.  At minimum we raise the age to buy any kind of gun to 21.  Additionally, I would support we ban the sale, transfer, importation of these or similar weapons.  Thirdly ban bump stocks or similar device.
4747 2018-02-16 20:53:03 Most of the stocks in 2017 behaved like bamboo investing model. How does one explain compounding in bamboo model with stock? Is Business strategy/Management of change/expansion/delayed gratification etc the reason for the rapid growth? Im new learner hence ignore if irrelevant.
4748 2018-02-16 20:52:54 Well, at least one of my stocks is trending upwards again

4752 2018-02-16 20:50:25 Agreed that bump stocks needlessly get around the ban on automatic weapons and should be fixed.
4753 2018-02-16 20:50:02 No silencers, no Bump Stocks, and NO AR-15s to any individual.  Period.  #GunControlNow   Do not vote for any politician who receives NRA campaign money.  #GetNRAoutofPolitics
4754 2018-02-16 20:49:11 All mass killings were done with AR-15 . Mental health? Then why did GOP pass a law to give access to guns to people with mental issues?We need to ban AR-15, bomb stocks &large capacity mag. No one should kiss their child in the morning& then see them in a body bag in afternoon.

4757 2018-02-16 20:48:41 After that quick correction stocks have a strong week. Coming into the weekend perhaps a bit weary. Great time for 3 days off.
4758 2018-02-16 20:47:43 (Bullshit for me. I don't remember much from my old Rumia account but I think I wasn't that good on her then. And I made a few terrible OCs that became laughing stocks and shit.)
4759 2018-02-16 20:47:32 That's how I feel if we ban things such as bump stocks.
4760 2018-02-16 20:47:19 they are hiring crazy and staff easily get $20K, $40K etc stocks each year. might be this reason?

4762 2018-02-16 20:46:24 Here, I'll give you a breakdown:

Two bump stocks: $180

Case of 5.56 ammo (1000 rounds): $311

10 30-round magazines: $150

All delivered to your house.

I'm not even at $2800 yet.

You don't know shit, dude.
4763 2018-02-16 20:46:21 UA origin corn took almost 100% in EU weekly imports

BR%=47%,-1.4%
Platts underlined, Brazil finished its corn exporting campaign
Investors expect EU to return in greater capacity to UA market by Apr, when stocks run low.

4765 2018-02-16 20:45:53 Folks are hegging against inflation by buying stocks. Im not sure that's a good thing .
4766 2018-02-16 20:45:37 Oh sorry I should have added bump stocks but there weren't even "not full auto ARs"--you are missing the point--no one needs an automatic rifle to protect their home and the Constitution wasn't written to include them

4769 2018-02-16 20:44:27 I don't like these 'value light' products... I want hardcore value with real risk/reward... Besides there is no detailed explanation for how the algorithm picks these stocks. I don't like PE multiples.
4770 2018-02-16 20:44:15 30 year treasuries stabilizing at these levels, even is the face of rising stocks, strong consumer confidence and rising inflation. Trading action supports our thesis that there is a very deep bid from $40 trillion of global pension funds as long rates head toward 3.5%. #treasury
4771 2018-02-16 20:43:35 @jimcramer As you suggest, I rank my stocks buy now, buy into weakness, sell into strength. My question is when do I know it’s time to ‘circle the wagons’?
4772 2018-02-16 20:43:12 PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
4773 2018-02-16 20:42:52 Even conservative Justice Scalia has said that assault weapons should not be covered under the Second Amendment.  I have no need for a repeating assault rifle.   It’s crazy we can’t even stop the sale of bump stocks to make legal weapons illegal.
4774 2018-02-16 20:42:30 Siri is taking Oz back in Time on Tardis the Life Boat  Earth.  zion need not chase tail, fawns and fairies  always run away and hide for a time and then come out when its bankrupt. Oh yeah baby. Buying Opportunity. at 95% loss. all stocks 60 days. Warning  Crash
4775 2018-02-16 20:41:56 Funny how your so willing to say that the FBI failed but not that you or your fellow Repubs failed kids by not strengthening gun laws and banning auto/semi-auto weapons.After Vegas shooting you Repub blowhards said need new law to outlaw “bump stocks”What happened???NOTHING
4776 2018-02-16 20:41:42 “no sirs! pls invest in my stocks and get 2% a year on your fiatbux that depreciate 2.5% in value yearly!!!”
4777 2018-02-16 20:40:45 What’s going on with $NTFL? Are they dead and buried?
4778 2018-02-16 20:40:44 One more idea is to research who owns gun stocks and go after them
4779 2018-02-16 20:40:13 Better late than never....now what about AR 15s? Bump stocks?  Background checks?
4780 2018-02-16 20:40:11 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
4781 2018-02-16 20:39:48 What about starting some sensible gun legislation: like banning AR-15 assault weapons and bump stocks.
4782 2018-02-16 20:39:47 Company I used to work for just got bought. Trying to contact someone from there to see if the (few) stocks I bought are worth anything.

4787 2018-02-16 20:36:13 I love penny stocks. (Sarcasm)
4788 2018-02-16 20:35:35 And even with the bump stock he was using... he could have done more damage taking aimed shots. There's a reason the military uses auto fire to keep heads down, not aimed shots to actually try to kill. But bump stocks make it scarier....

4790 2018-02-16 20:34:09 @marcorubio And Marco Rubio is one of the top 10 recipients of NRA money. And Marco Rubio fails to entertain any gun legislation such as banning AR-15 or Bump stocks. And your response Mr. Rubio is..... deadly silence.

4792 2018-02-16 20:33:44 Ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks and have comprehensive background checks. That shouldn't threaten a responsible gun owner.
4793 2018-02-16 20:33:27 ACTUAL action from the @GOP, not just "thinking and praying"....Wow what an idea. Yes, ban assault weapons + Bump stocks.
4794 2018-02-16 20:33:03 @SenRubioPress  enough, allow the fbi to talk with families, meanwhile get ready to explain why you voted with grassley for mentally ill ppl to more easily get guns,cut $ for mental health,ignore stopping butt stocks or stop sucking up  gun lobby money

4800 2018-02-16 20:29:54 They want him in the WH signing a bill to ban bump stocks and the AR-15.     Grieving parents and families don’t want to hear his empty promises. #NRAbloodmoney #nosoul #noempathy
4801 2018-02-16 20:29:46 How about the @GOP who stopped the ban on assault type weapons, or reversed the requirement to put mentally ill people's name on the FIB database, or their refusal to expand background checks, or their refusal to ban gun stocks, or.........
4802 2018-02-16 20:28:54 Well the money doesn't come from Alberta. The oil industry is in the toilet. Stocks and sales are down. There is a world glut trying to get rid of the oil to pay for the losses. Is someone telling you Alberta is rich because of the #Tarsands?
4803 2018-02-16 20:28:34 Yes. And “bump stocks”. And free the CDC to study gun violence.  And adopt evidence-based public laws that will hold gun makers liable and get NRA out of  laundering for Russians to give to GOP. For starters.

4805 2018-02-16 20:27:11 I told you. I'm giving you the argument on bump stocks. Full auto has basically been illegal in the US since 1934. I don't see a use for them except for fun on the range. Now explain how a pistol grip, a barrel shroud, and black paint change the functionality.
4806 2018-02-16 20:25:37 Promise I'm not trolling you, ha. It just looked like another bankrupt pink sheet. I don't do penny stocks, but I'll root for ya. Good luck on this trade.
4807 2018-02-16 20:25:00 Friends don't let friends buy stocks at 30x eps at the end of the cycle. Stay safe out there, folks.
4808 2018-02-16 20:24:22 Energy stocks pretty flat on option ex day, except for $CLD. Off 20% of earnings. Not a bad co., still trading at 2.4x cash, but coal is basically in death spiral mode. Don't tell the Prez, lol
4809 2018-02-16 20:23:42 People who are trading stocks like $riot know it is a scam but they don’t care as long as they can make $ and get out. This is 100% truth. Sad but true
4810 2018-02-16 20:23:27 I’ve heard plenty.

1. Banning Bump Stocks
2. Banning those with pre-existing mental conditions from purchasing fire arms.
3. Nation wide buybacks

4813 2018-02-16 20:21:01 Haters gonna hate Mr. PRESIDENT.   You won, America is Stronger, stocks higher, we are living in MAGA times!  ISIS DEFEATED TOO!
4814 2018-02-16 20:20:51 Canadian cannibus stocks might go up as some of the companies have international exposure. I am not a broker, just a citizen, but I think I will ask a broker friend about it.
4815 2018-02-16 20:17:48 $VIX still up 5% with stocks up...
4816 2018-02-16 20:17:46 Except a bump stock doesn't make it magically automatic. There's a reason you don't see armies around the work using bump stocks in their rifles. Just accept it, the problem is not guns, is a mental illness issue.
4817 2018-02-16 20:17:44 Jason Chaffetz said the other night the NRA for example, wanted to do legislation getting rid of bump stocks. So a bill is written & INEVITIBLY, some Dem will try to sneak/pass their own special interest issue into the gun bill! So, the whole thing blows up & never happens!
4818 2018-02-16 20:17:17 That won't work here so we'll have to compromise.  Ban any and ALL semi automatic weapons and bump stocks - you've rounded up a huge amount of destruction there just in that.  Know your players.  
4819 2018-02-16 20:15:55 Penny stocks
4820 2018-02-16 20:15:39 The point of Whole 30 is to look at what you’re consuming and, man, there really is sugar added to everything. (Not to be confused with the amount of natural sugars in fruit, etc.) Many kinds and brands of broths and stocks, for example.
4821 2018-02-16 20:15:37 Can’t we work on making guns safer? No bump stocks. Trigger locks or other safety measures built in (fingerprint technology?). Owner responsibility. Many other things, too. Meanwhile, make schools and public venues safer. Then exercise right to vote for better legislators.
4822 2018-02-16 20:15:22 Yes and I am a gun owner. No one needs "assault weapons", or bump stocks, or magazines that hold dozens and dozens of rounds, and some kind of mental health background check when buying a gun because now all you do is ck a box saying you aren't under psychiatric care.
4823 2018-02-16 20:15:09 Well, it's easy to cheerlead genetically, but enumerating specifics would be more compelling. How do you register tokens with the SEC for securities that aren't traded as stocks? Specifically?
4824 2018-02-16 20:15:05 I am holding some as well. It did a r/s recently and I believe the o/s is very low...we have to wait to see what happens

4827 2018-02-16 20:13:48 That's not a fair comparison; S&P 500 is a single asset class - large cap stocks. WealthFront has many more asset classes (Bonds, commodities, foreign stocks) included in their portfolio. If you want to put all your eggs in one basket, just buy S&P 500 - but it's def more risky.
4828 2018-02-16 20:13:32 Debating whether to just delete my social media or not. Kinda tired of reading about shootings, as sad as it is gun laws won’t change, they tried making bump stocks illegal after Vegas and that never went through. That was over 800 people, why would it change over 17..?
4829 2018-02-16 20:13:26 Stocks fell due to fake news that Jerome Powell would raise interest rates when he took over the Fed from Janet Yellen. Of course he didn’t and stocks went back up. My 401k has fully recovered.
4830 2018-02-16 20:13:03 Pomp, have you ever tried to SELL tokens?!  Much easier/faster to sell stocks.
4831 2018-02-16 20:11:35 Trading slows in the Mortgage Bond market as players may be heading out early to get a jump on the three-day weekend. Stocks well off highs.

4837 2018-02-16 20:09:26 Back to my original point. Listen, 32 people were killed with a hand gun. What does the caliber of bullet have anything to do with it. AR-15 is semi auto just as a hand gun. There’s no 3 round burst on civilian ARs. If your talking accessories such as bump stocks then that’s diff
4838 2018-02-16 20:07:39 signs like you're upset. Lol. He's accomplished plenty in a year with so many fighting against him. My paycheck is up. My stocks are up too. Jerusalem is once again recognized as the true capital of Israel.
4839 2018-02-16 20:07:31 I can legally sign my life over to the US government at 18, but I have to wait till I'm 21 to gamble, consume alcohol, smoke Marijuana or invest in stocks. The government's reason? Because people under 21 are unable to make smart decisions. Hmm.
4840 2018-02-16 20:07:31 Also; you can mod many rifles out to turn them into tactical weapons... lighter stocks, large magazines, legally the only part of a firearm that is registered is lower receiver... you can legally purchase it and the mod out the weapons system: lived near Ft. Bragg too long lol.

4843 2018-02-16 20:07:18 I’m trying to decide if the government is inept, lazy, if they just don’t care, and/or see it as a way to raise the value of gun stocks which I’m sure they have investments in. Perhaps all of the above.

4847 2018-02-16 20:06:57 Ban bump stocks, fully fund a federal-local interagency info sharing and action effort to pursue leads on shootings and other threats
4848 2018-02-16 20:06:54 For a start, you can stop being fatalistic about the situation, and stop making excuses for the NRA and their shills who consistently block any attempt to institute realistic controls, like outlawing assault weapons, bump stocks, and high-capacity clips.
4849 2018-02-16 20:06:40 fuck it imma get into penny stocks
idk what im doing but fuck it i've been successful in producing, planting, my job, etc. without any knowledge  so why tf not
4850 2018-02-16 20:06:20 "Criminals" will keep acquiring them. That much is true. But maybe an 18 year wouldn't be able to get a weapon so easily and shoot up his classmates. Or less of them, if you limit magazine size (which seems very reasonable). Ten round mags and no bump stocks mean a lot less dead.
4851 2018-02-16 20:06:08 Stocks aren’t going through the roof. Sorry. Stop watching Fox propaganda.

4854 2018-02-16 20:06:01 Cause it's not...
How is an egg not a military grade weapon?

Your point was AR made both the ar15 & m16 so YOU say the ar15 is military grade

By the same logic... Matel Made m16 stocks & barbies... m16 stocks were military grade... so barbies must be too... right?
4855 2018-02-16 20:05:50 Oh ye of little faith! Quit screwing with my stocks!
4856 2018-02-16 20:05:48 Only our government can order stoppage of manufacture of things like bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.

The private sector isn't going to regulate itself in that regard.
4857 2018-02-16 20:05:36 $mgon Potential reverse merger in play here
4858 2018-02-16 20:05:07 1. Background checks on all sales including 3rd party. 2. Ban high capacity mags and bump stocks. 3. Crosscheck no fly + terrorist watch list. 4. Conceal carry require a proficiency test same as a drivers license and must be renewed every 5 years. 5. Increase mental health screen
4859 2018-02-16 20:05:06 trump and rick scott have to go to parkland and say they support ak assault rifles and bum stocks but are truly sorry that the children are collateral damage, the children are just the price of freedom!
4860 2018-02-16 20:04:16 Nevada had like 20 guns...and he had Bump stocks. Ban one and and the next cheapest will take its place. Overhaul on the process is required, not a symbolic bandaid
4861 2018-02-16 20:03:18 And yet, your cronies want to continue to make it easier to get guns, to be able to use silencers, to have access to bump stocks. I'm a survivor of a school shooting and y'all think you know what it's like, you know NOTHING about it. #GunReformNow
4862 2018-02-16 20:03:12 Again, the AR-15 is NO different. The accessories are different. You can take a .308 ( hunting rifle ) and convert to an M1A 30 round mag all day. And the .308 is ballistically superior. I'm all for banning bump stocks and 30 round mags. But ban AR-15 and crazies just switch guns
4863 2018-02-16 20:03:05 I am ok with the banning of AR-15 & bump stocks. And how about the age  buy ANY gun is raised to 21 as you suggest IF one is in the military. I know a few of 18-21 yr old who should not even be driving, voting, or procreating.  These kids screaming at the moon & need safe spaces.

4868 2018-02-16 20:01:05 Challenges for betting against crypto stocks
A major challenge for shorting bitcoin-related stocks is not being able to borrow shares, Left said. Short-sellers typically borrow shares and sell them in the expectation they can buy back the shares at a cheaper price in the future.

4870 2018-02-16 20:00:28 Sell Higher High, and just wait for the companies to hit “market stocks with Corporate scandals greater than Empire on Fox.  The REAL world is a gun to your head saying hail marys; but what if you made the game? what if we are gods and we take whole “swat teams” sleep spells.
4871 2018-02-16 20:00:12 Went to June. Up so far. Any ideas on stocks that haven’t rebounded? I was looking at de but spooked on earnings
4872 2018-02-16 19:59:41 Gun control means universal background checks, re-instating automatic and semi automatic guns and bump stocks. You don't need these to hunt, unless your hunting humans. And, we also need to make sure no one mentally ill, who had a domestic violence or assault charge, gets a gun
4873 2018-02-16 19:59:28 I think probably only an extreme minority of people who hold any asset (or agree to terms of use, or hold stocks, or almost anything else) have a good understanding of the thing they're holding or agreeing to. 1/2

4876 2018-02-16 19:58:42 Thank u.Guns are one thing, but WHY do civilians need access to an AR-15 or bump stocks? Also, I work in healthcare. We don't adequately treat mental illness anymore because resources have been cut to the bone. I simply refuse to be complicit while kids are slaughtered at school.
4877 2018-02-16 19:58:25 Yet they’re readily available to people. After the shooting in Las Vegas near the end of last year, many members of Congress and I believe even the NRA initially supported banning the sale of bump stocks and yet no legislation was ever passed
4878 2018-02-16 19:58:17 MA has relatively strong gun laws and is working on making them stronger. It already passed a law banning bump stocks after the Vegas shooting. It has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the continental US.
4879 2018-02-16 19:58:02 Why?  Paper towels are not needed.  If you refuse to remove all AR15’s and bump stocks, continue to turn a blind eye on mental health, and our so called background checks... then don’t bother saying how terribly tragic and sorry you are.  Fake POTUS!
4880 2018-02-16 19:57:43 Make getting guns as difficult as getting a drivers licenses, or an abortion. And get AR's, silencers, and bump stocks OFF the streets. AR's were illegal once, we need to get there again and get back laws for mental health checks.

4883 2018-02-16 19:57:16 I think you misread your tea leaves. Obama provided "Bail Out" money which was then used by Wall Street to pay bonuses to executives. That was a shitty thing for them to do but the Wall Street that DT loves to praise was able to survive. "Stocks are Up" - DT
4884 2018-02-16 19:57:11 I never said prevent. I said help prevent. And this info is easily available and has been for many years, but for starters: 1) background checks on all gun sales 2) mandatory reporting requirements into the background check system 3) ban bump stocks and large capacity mags
4885 2018-02-16 19:56:58 Only prayers to answer is ban on ALL assault weapons.clips.bumper stocks
4886 2018-02-16 19:56:54 I know that there’s a difference between semi-automatic and automatic, but the weapon used in the shooting on Tuesday was semi-automatic. And what about bump stocks? They decrease the amount of time between firing to allow a semi to act similarly to an automatic weapon
4887 2018-02-16 19:56:21 that's how he takes stocks

4896 2018-02-16 19:53:01 1st you have a voluntary ntl gun buyback to get guns out of circulation. Then you ban silencers, bump stocks, & assault weapons that everyday citizens don't need. Over time, this lowers access to the weapons. The formula isn't that difficult. Convincing RWNJs is the hard part.
4897 2018-02-16 19:52:56 Short range, you have to be in stocks to take advantage of Trump's election. The corporations are salivating over tax cuts.
4898 2018-02-16 19:52:46 It should be noted that legally speaking, the Fed is not permitted to make direct stock purchases. However, there is nothing to prevent it from funding a Special Purpose Vehicle that could then buy stocks through indexes or Exchange Traded Funds.

4904 2018-02-16 19:51:14 I may be wrong, but I feel the problem with most of retail traders to trade in FnO is less capital (knowledge as well). With 1-2L, the 2-3atr range of any FnO stocks will take them out with 4-5wrong trades

4907 2018-02-16 19:49:25 most hand guns are semi auto u have some wheel guns but majority are semi. I agree u don't need bump stocks things that modify a weapon to fully auto & should be banned. I agree but going after legal gun owners who are responsible isn't right.
4908 2018-02-16 19:49:19 No I'm not attacking you.  I'm speaking the truth.  I don't trade illiquid stocks.  Watch my videos and read my tweets.  We're simply not on the same page here.  I suggest you stop wasting your time responding to me and figure out how things work for yourself first.
4909 2018-02-16 19:49:15 What if, and I am just spit baling here, increasing access to therapists AND limiting access to semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, & large ammo magazines?

4934 2018-02-16 19:36:43 At this point we need an “all of the above” method. Get AR-15s/bump stocks off of the streets. Have stringent universal background checks and mental health checks before purchasing a gun.

4941 2018-02-16 19:34:03 Wondering how many actually bother to read the Constitution? The 2nd Amendment reserves firearms for use by official State militia which is National Guard.

When it comes to high powered automatic rifles and bump stocks, these should be reserved for the military and  the police.
4942 2018-02-16 19:33:09 Shame on you.  Once again, "Too soon" is the rally cry for not addressing mass shootings then it is ignored by you.  Sad that NRA money can buy you but the good of our people is worthless to you.  Won't even vote to ban bump stocks & semi-automatics.
4943 2018-02-16 19:33:05 These are good choices, amazon being the most expensive. I suggest to download the Robinhood app and make an account. Look up what companies stocks you want to keep an eye on and have them on there. Right now its fluctuating all sorts.
4944 2018-02-16 19:33:00 Work with congress to get rid of assault type weapons and bump stocks....that's what you need to do Donnie
4945 2018-02-16 19:32:50 Semi auto = pull the trigger once and one bullet fires
Full auto = pull the trigger once and lots of bullets fire 

Semi auto has no set rate of fire, and this is why "bump" stocks do not make a semi auto firearm full auto, but that's a different topic entirely.
4946 2018-02-16 19:32:00 They are popular because they can be modified in many ways. Not just with bump stocks. To make them full auto is illegal. Some security ppl carry them. They are large caliber, so they are useful for large game, such as bear and moose. Many like them. And they’re legal.
4947 2018-02-16 19:31:10 It isn't but it's modified from military weapons to be semi automatic due to automatic weapons bans.  Oh wait, we banned automatic weapons--so maybe we should include semi automatic rifles like the AR-15 and bump stocks and any other modifications that turn a semi into a full.
4948 2018-02-16 19:31:06 I'm a Texan & grew up w hunters. I like shooting guns. Guns are not inherently bad, but when 18 y-o can buy & there's gun show/individual sale loopholes & guns/bump stocks that can cause carnage are for sale, CONTROL is necessary. Keep what u have = good.

4955 2018-02-16 19:30:12 @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner @RepJaredPolis Listen. You work for your constituents, not the NRA.Stop taking their $$$. Ban the sale of automatic weapons, ban bump stocks. Take action to stop the senseless killing of our kids. The time has long passed.
4956 2018-02-16 19:29:13 Agreed with several folks here:
1. Redo the ban that the Clinton era had -BUT FIRST MAKE CLEAR DEFINITIONS.
2. Ban bump stocks.
3. Be CERTAIN not to legalize silencers.
4. Reimpose the ban on mentally ill adults. Talk to APA, they'll explain what I've seen over 25 yrs. in MH work
4957 2018-02-16 19:29:07 I hope our President gets his people together to put list of changes that might help. Like when you buy a gun sign that you will keep it locked and be responsible  if used for evil. Only allowed to own gun if 21 or join the military. Ban bump stocks.  Harden targets like schools.
4958 2018-02-16 19:28:58 Machine guns are already banned almost everywhere. Legal assault rifles are semi-auto and very similar to semi-auto non-assault rifles in terms of what they actually do. Naively focusing on assault rifles doesn't work (see "bump stocks"). We need to go further.
4959 2018-02-16 19:28:51 What's the compromise eventually. I want to solve this issue. Let's talk specific ideas. I want to:

Ban bump stocks
Ban mentally ill people from owning guns
Expand background checks
Expand waiting times
limit mag capacities
more strictly enforce all gun laws
etc

What about you?

4962 2018-02-16 19:27:51 For the GOP and the Right, condolences, flowers, plus protection of semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines, & bump stocks & more $ from the NRA to pursue their toxic agenda.
4963 2018-02-16 19:27:06 People need to know how big this bitcoin/blockchain is. It could possibly take down Wall Street 20 years from now. That’s how big a deal it is. People compare it to stocks, tulips, bubbles, etc.  it’s all nonsense. It’s going to change everything in the monetary system.
4964 2018-02-16 19:26:58 Cheap Stocks 
4965 2018-02-16 19:26:48 Sorry, I meant limited ammo for assault rifles only. Unlimited ammo for guns of personal and safety use. Also, I think bump stocks should be completely illegal. No one needs to lose all their guns. Bipartisanship and small compromises can make a huge difference here.
4966 2018-02-16 19:26:42 US stocks pale reddish to reddish
4967 2018-02-16 19:26:23 We should buy out all the stocks of ammo, guns are harmless without ammo
4968 2018-02-16 19:26:20 Who got some stocks for me?
4969 2018-02-16 19:26:02 in doing so you eliminate the profit motive and turn over subsistence supply chains to people to determine what they want to do with them and allow them the self determination to reduce or eliminate industrial feed stocks of animal derived products
4970 2018-02-16 19:25:36 Some things that I think should be looked at:
-Smart gun technology
-Required background checks
-Required psych evaluations
-Ban on bump stocks
-Mandatory gun safety class
-Wait times
-Required two years of gun ownership with no violent incidence before owning an AR-15
4971 2018-02-16 19:24:31 Yes. And clip size, bump stocks, armor piercing bullets, silencers. Repeal HJRes40 & reinstate the ban on seriously mentally ill persons buying guns. Ban 0-backgroud checks for buys at gun shows. Fund unified background check system.
4972 2018-02-16 19:24:28 $VKTX "they're" trying to move this w/ the market now, as if it's already a "big board" stocks. Frustrating but that's what it seems like.
4973 2018-02-16 19:23:58 Ban rapid-trigger rifles and bump stocks.
4974 2018-02-16 19:23:23 Yes.  Bump stocks and high round magazines too.
4975 2018-02-16 19:23:22 or the add ons that make them such as bump stocks....
4976 2018-02-16 19:22:28 Every time I hear that anguished mother crying out for Trump to DO something, I get chills and tears. HOW can people continue to ignore, cannot FEEL, the horror, the pain?  Get rid of the FUCKING assault rifles bump stocks, silencers.  ALL are designed for one purpose:  /1
4977 2018-02-16 19:22:24 Why WOULDN'T centrist democrats hate Trump's justice department enforcing a gun ban? Scary brown people put back in jail, private prison stocks go up, prison labor skyrockets, The Problem gets shoved back under the rug and everyone lives their stepford life again.
4978 2018-02-16 19:22:24 @TheJusticeDept Pls pursue the ‘Charge’: “@GOP Guilty of conspiracy to allow the slaughter of U.S. Citizen school children in order to protect the ‘Free Enterprise’ sales of Ar-15 Assault Rifles & Bump-Stocks indiscriminately for gain, Position, and 501(c)4 NRA bribes!” GUILTY!!!
4979 2018-02-16 19:22:04 @TheJusticeDept Pls pursue the ‘Charge’: “@GOP Guilty of conspiracy to allow the slaughter of U.S. Citizen school children in order to protect the ‘Free Enterprise’ sales of Ar-15 Assault Rifles & Bump-Stocks indiscriminately for gain, Position, and 501(c)4 NRA bribes!” GUILTY!!!

4993 2018-02-16 19:17:12 @jimcramer my advisor says that there is no correlation between the fixed income (bonds) market and equities (specifically stocks)....is he just plain wrong or is there some truth to this?
4994 2018-02-16 19:16:43 I am in from just under $0.22! Trial results will make or break this stock but that's the risk you take on pharma stocks.
4995 2018-02-16 19:16:28 Russians succeeded in undermining public confidence in stocks market with this indictment, big sellof upon that news
4996 2018-02-16 19:15:33 Mental Illness can be a factor. But SANE ANGRY VENGEFUL folks are ALSO out there. Either way, ADDING  AR-15s & Bump Stocks to the already existing Weapons Ban List is a MAJOR START!
4997 2018-02-16 19:15:19 After getting interested in crypto and learning about tokens and ICOs I really couldn’t see myself going backwards to invest in stocks and IPOs.
4998 2018-02-16 19:15:16 I was trying to tell someone once about that amusing clip of Bobby Davro falling flat on his face in the stocks.
4999 2018-02-16 19:15:07 As a value investor, you get paid for doing uncomfortable things like buying stocks that everyone hates. #DeepValue #ContrarianValue
5000 2018-02-16 19:14:29 Definitions matter. I want to ban things like bump stocks, and limit mag capacities. But like the NY large soda ban (where they had to define large to be able to enact a ban) we have to define what we want to ban correctly, or it won't be effective.

5003 2018-02-16 19:12:32 @SpeakerRyan I know it’s too soon to talk about gun control but can we talk about bump stocks yet? 

Asking for a (dead) friend.
5004 2018-02-16 19:12:24 Of course we support reform, which includes voting against racist incumbents like yourself. U serve the people,we don’t serve u. Over 85% of both parties want gun reform,meaning background checks,refusing to let mentally incompetent persons buy a gun & banning bump stocks.
5005 2018-02-16 19:12:19 stocks sliding this afternoon... i wonder whats up with alibaba and facebook... i'm still down on them
5006 2018-02-16 19:12:09 The laws/checks aren't working.  If I were not legally able to purchase, I can still get my hands on at least ten, right now, without even making a phone call. Needs improvement big.  Ban auto and semi-auto and bump stocks and any gun that a bump stock would make semi.
5007 2018-02-16 19:11:37 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5008 2018-02-16 19:11:21 Watching stocks slowly.. slowly... 
5009 2018-02-16 19:11:20 NRA is controlled opposition. They were ready to cave on bump stocks. They have done nothing to proactively challenge unconstitutional bans on automatic weapons.
5010 2018-02-16 19:11:14 Right now nothing is being done. The GOP has not even put in a law against bump stocks. They are owned by the nra. Think what would happen if one of their kids was at that school.
5011 2018-02-16 19:11:09 Gold trades like stocks now.
5012 2018-02-16 19:10:20 Value investing at its core is buying something for less than it's worth. Traditionally was easiest with statistically cheap stocks. But following Buffett's lead, value devotees have newfound preference for value in quality names. But what to do when there's a quality premium?!
5013 2018-02-16 19:10:07 I think marami silang stocks but depends on the title siguro? Konti lang title selection e. Pero free admission naman so ok lang bumalik haha! I might go din uli. Baka may new titles kasi na nilalabas din.
5014 2018-02-16 19:10:00 Yet @GOP refuses to update assault weapons ban or ban bump stocks, expand background checks, makes it easier for mentally ill to get weapons, etc....,,
5015 2018-02-16 19:09:56 Federally maintained background checks (mental illness, violent crime, domestic, animal & child abuse); mandatory weapon training, tests, and renewal; mandatory insurance and gun safes; mandatory reporting of theft and loss of weapons. Ban on high capacity clips, bump stocks.
5016 2018-02-16 19:09:43 @AkinsAbayomi  getting t-bills of 1 year is the only way to best current inflation, however to beat the current inflation, then u need to invest in other  financial instruments either of money market (commercial papers etc  or capital markets (stocks etc,)
5017 2018-02-16 19:09:29 Agreed Darren American's have the right to own guns to protect themselves and/or hunt.  AK15 are guns that are meant to kill people, created for war.  As are armor piercing bullets, silencers and bump stocks.
5018 2018-02-16 19:09:05 The best analogy I’ve ever heard: Stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down.
5019 2018-02-16 19:08:45 All guns should be registered like cars. They need a national database that all information goes into to close the state to state sales, internet sales, gun shows, etc. It should track ammunition & accessories like bump stocks. The background check should be in there as well.
5020 2018-02-16 19:08:22 Agree with 95% of what you said but an AR-15 has been the weapon of choice for most of these mass shootings, higher capacity clips, lightweight and collapsible butt stocks make them easy to use in tight quarters. I’m not saying ban them, just make them be registered like a car.
5021 2018-02-16 19:08:19 It's always been the bird you'd see most of on there, not today. Don't know if fish stocks are low because of the low water levels last year. Only thing I can think.

5024 2018-02-16 19:07:43 Maybe my tweet could have been clearer, but i never said AR-15s are fully automatic, only that they should be on the banned list with the fully automatic weapons. see also: bump stocks. Thnx.
5025 2018-02-16 19:07:32 CGUD? PNOW
5026 2018-02-16 19:07:31 Yeah to push the legality of gun silencers and bump stocks. Probably just gonna play golf and say you’re “working from home”...
5027 2018-02-16 19:07:19 The NRA of course.
They know their more fanatical base wants military-style automatic weapons, so they lobby to keep bump stocks and other mods legal.
Really bugs me how such a small group has so much leverage. They’re only ~5 million members. Shows how broken our system is.
5028 2018-02-16 19:06:53 Trading slows in the Mortgage Bond market as players may be heading out early to get a jump on the three-day weekend. Stocks well off highs.
5029 2018-02-16 19:06:52 It’s the person behind trigger sweet heart.  The gun did not walk into that school did it?  No it did not.  A boy that is mentally ill . I agree we don’t need bump stocks and Ar-15should not be sold to the public that should remain a military assault rifle only
5030 2018-02-16 19:06:52 Thanks for reaching out I support ERPO (H.3081); MA Legislature passed comprehensive gun violence reforms in 2014 & became the 1st state to ban bump-stocks in Fall 2017; supportive of any legislation that would prevent tragedies like what occurred in Corral Springs
5031 2018-02-16 19:06:32 How many people pumped otc shit stocks to death to make 4 cheeseburgers profit and that’s with the discount they get from working at the burger joint. I’m mostly action and bigger profits . Oh I have a real job too.
5032 2018-02-16 19:05:31 Absolutely.  Question is, does the curve revert upon more data, that supports the previous curve?  i.e. sentiment is discounting robustness of current data as trend, so flattening the curve to anticipate the stocks adjustments (builds).  The model is always sensitive to this 1/
5033 2018-02-16 19:05:19 The ambulances couldnt get close due to 40k people packed in and traffic.  You know titties, games, and stocks but are completely out of your league on emergency responses to emergencies
5034 2018-02-16 19:04:41 we cannot blame algo's for everything. meaning when market blew up on forced selling, it was algo's and when it is ramping up it is again algo's. i think humans are also playing their part in this mess as the stocks find price discovery in their up and down movements.
5035 2018-02-16 19:04:13 Absolutely!  There is no reason on God’s green earth an average American should have access to, or need of, an AR! Don’t ban all guns, just AR’s and “bump stocks”.
5036 2018-02-16 19:04:13 That’s fantastic!!!!   I hope we do too!
5037 2018-02-16 19:04:07 shouldn't affect earnings based stocks ... maybe some momo entities
5038 2018-02-16 19:03:48 Okay, let’s talk about the Las Vegas shooting, is it too soon to talk about that @SpeakerRyan ?  How’s that ban on bump stocks coming?  I bet you are proud that you passed legislation to keep mentally ill people off the FBI list so they are able to buy guns. Way to go @GOP !
5039 2018-02-16 19:03:39 With a shooting every two or three days in this country it will never be the right time to stop this violence by assault rifles. Ban bump stocks. Ban military hardware for civilians.
5040 2018-02-16 19:02:58 Besides the stocks mentioned below my 3 income equities are #saga #APF and #CYN - bias towards commodities and the aging saga louts!
5041 2018-02-16 19:02:56 Yes. And bump stocks.
5042 2018-02-16 19:02:55 J’ai eu les mêmes merde ! C’est Amazon qui gère pas les stocks au bout d’un mois et demi j’ai appeler Elgato aux US et ils m’ont dit de passer par leur site ils ont un entrepôt en Allemagne et ils ont du stock !! Cheers

5048 2018-02-16 19:00:24 The notion of #bitcoin leading #stocks right now is not insane. $btc and #crypto is essentially injecting sentiment liquidity in the market. HFT for speculation. Wasn't any coincidence the market volatility came on the heels of record-low cash levels by indiv investors.
5049 2018-02-16 19:00:05 Yea, whatever the hell happened to action on bump stocks @SpeakerRyan ?
5050 2018-02-16 18:59:49 stocks this week more volatile than my mood swings
5051 2018-02-16 18:59:41 Why didn’t the DEMs pass new gun laws in 2009-10 when they had majorities? Clips, bump stocks, assault weapons, background check improvements etc. crickets.
5052 2018-02-16 18:59:40 It's not just that there are too many guns, it's the kind of guns.  Charles Whitman spent 90 minutes in a Texas tower armed with 3 hunting type rifles & killed 15 people, the Las Vegas shooter had 23 guns, many with bump stocks, and killed 58 people in 10 min.
5053 2018-02-16 18:59:29 Of course it doesn't. Repealing does nothing to future guns either. It just allows for the possibility of new laws. So first step repeal then second step pass new laws. The new laws could apply to existing gun stocks.
5054 2018-02-16 18:59:00 sauf que je ne vois pas pourquoi. Non seulement c un non sens d'un point de vue comptable : on ne mélange pas ce qui relève des dépenses courantes (des flux) et des dépenses d'investissement (des stocks) (1)
5055 2018-02-16 18:58:51 And we couldn't get Congress to pass a law outlawing bump stocks.
5056 2018-02-16 18:58:41 Looks like today's high on the $SPX & Dow will mark the high for the recent rebound. 10-Yr Treasuries will likely have more room upward still & MORE importantly less positive correlation with stocks.
5057 2018-02-16 18:57:45 Along with bump stocks & any other kit to convert another weapon into an automatic one, high capacity magazines, hollow point bullets, & armor piercing bullets. In short, ANYTHING that is designed to kill many people quickly.
5058 2018-02-16 18:57:40 Well I don't really think civilian's need bump stocks .And there also needs to be different laws for school type mass shootings . Swift death penalty and harsh sentence for threatening to do so
5059 2018-02-16 18:57:27 There r a lot of quiet loopholes that ppl need to get educated about also. Ex. some states w/3 day waiting periods also have default, so if not complete the person gets gun anyway. Bump stocks have diff laws for sale/use so saying illegal to use isn't illegal to buy. Need both.
5060 2018-02-16 18:57:25 The gun lobby wants bump stocks to stay legal. They lobbied heavily against the bill that was introduced after Las Vegas, while publicly pretending to support it. I remember watching the whole thing and shaking my head at the continued inaction.
5061 2018-02-16 18:57:14 guess the OPEX run up is over, now back to restocking everybodys 401k's with higher price stocks
5062 2018-02-16 18:57:13 Boyyyyyyy my stocks rebounded 
5063 2018-02-16 18:57:09 @KimKardashian & happiness you should get. So be sure to invest carefully, stocks is been very wonderful for my husband & I & saving has also been easy for many years I used to be very materialistic, clothes, furniture, cars, just everything that wasn't necessary. But today we
5064 2018-02-16 18:57:04 Indeed. I'm totally fine with banning bump stocks. You don't need it for self-defense, you don't need it for hunting, you don't need it on the range. It's unnecessary for civilians and it's harmful if misused. Get rid of it.
5065 2018-02-16 18:55:40 Watching @AntonKreil and @lexvandam in Million Dollar Trader inspired me to re-evaluate my current trading plan, why was I avoiding stocks, bonds ect. and only focusing on crypto? Because I was uneducated. Thank you for the wake up call.
5066 2018-02-16 18:55:30 Location, location, location...But, management is top drawer.  I've been sniffing around it too, but not yet.  I think this is bottom, too, but I've other stocks I thnk have more torque, right now.  Great company, with an insane valuation, to the good side, if you're a buyer.
5067 2018-02-16 18:55:13 Jen is right I totally remember how the Revolutionary War was won with AR-15s and bump stocks
5068 2018-02-16 18:55:07 It's crazy how gun stocks always rise after Mass shootings
5069 2018-02-16 18:54:29 15' strafe gegen den EHC. Federolf hat da etwas zu engagiert vor dem eigenen Tor aufgeräumt. 2Minuten wegen hohen stocks
5070 2018-02-16 18:54:26 Well hunters can easily buy replacement guns from Walmart or wherever, but gang members and random criminals generally restore their stocks from guns illegally in circulation. If you have black market connections, you can buy a gun easily. Common for all kinds of criminals.
5071 2018-02-16 18:53:59 just quite trying to make sense of anything anymore until it just friggin dies bcs their is no narrative among fund/money managers or fin advisors that says stocks will drop. They are all in on tax cut plan and global growth story as evey piece of data flashing danger is shit
5072 2018-02-16 18:53:45 @POTUS Why, those people need privacy & peace, not a photo ops! You know you will not do ANYTHING about assault weapons, bump stocks or guns period! So why go there & make false promises? They don’t want you there!

5075 2018-02-16 18:52:56 Nothing less than banning the assault rifle AR 15, from all or any public purchase. Zero accessibility other than to the military, include "stocks" or what ever they were. That the half that goes with the other halve mental illness.
5076 2018-02-16 18:52:13 So you have Diamond and Gemstone assorters and evaluators who have give you the valuations in a day of the stocks valued at 5100/- crores - Mahashivratri ki Bhang an tak utri nahi kya? Kuch Bhi....
5077 2018-02-16 18:51:56 Yes, things like banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.
5078 2018-02-16 18:51:17 States are starting to ban bump stocks. Even the NRA is fine with outlawing bump stocks as long as the legislation doesn't ban other commonly-owned accessories.

It's Congress that doesn't get shit done.

5081 2018-02-16 18:50:07 How about banning semiautomatic and automatic guns. No bump stocks. Limit number of shots in a magazine and no sales to domestic abusers and induwith mental health issues.
5082 2018-02-16 18:49:23 Literally what business men? You're just repeating what Trump says when there's NO proof of any. Obviously investors aren't that interested considering our stocks fell over 1000 points TWICE this year

It devastated the stock market and signaled the beginning of the 12-year Great Depression.
5086 2018-02-16 18:47:34 Many of my friends and colleagues were at Route 91 in Vegas. 58 people killed and 851 injured from man using bump stocks. I have no plans of changing your mind as it’s made up. I do however hope people will see our dialogue and make an informed decision on the matter.
5087 2018-02-16 18:46:27 Traveling thru the pain and hardness of markt with patience vl definetly give good results. I remember the same downtime fr markt which occured last yr. I sold many stocks considering the ups n dwns.. but after 6 mnths all stocks which i sold had hit more than 40% retuns..

5091 2018-02-16 18:45:37 All our current senators and reps should be replaced if they can't get something done to rid bump stocks and automatic weapons. My hunter friends never killed a deer with an automatic. All afraid of the $ they'll lose from the NRA! Public rule, not private interests. Act now!

5101 2018-02-16 18:40:44 With Mueller indicting numerous Russian individuals and entities today for election interference, it’s a good time to look at stocks to invest in as a result. I pick KFC, as old Donald Trump himself is going to double sales by rage eating KFC by the bucket.

5104 2018-02-16 18:39:18 A lot of “blind” Apple followers love whatever Apple does, including their stocks. Unbelievable!
5105 2018-02-16 18:39:16 What we need (at least):
1. Must be 21 to purchase AR15
2. 3 day waiting period for ALL gun purchases. 
3. Ban bump stocks
4. Outlaw internet sale of AR 15 pieces which enable folks to build their own untraceable guns
#commonsense
5106 2018-02-16 18:39:15 Fun fact: When we played the stock market game in middle school, I "bought" Kroger stocks coz it looked like my last name.
5107 2018-02-16 18:38:51 The bigger issue is allowing military grade assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks that make these weapons even more dangerous to be sold. We are not living in a war zone. Why does any gun owner need a these outside of active military personnel in the field.
5108 2018-02-16 18:38:44 designed by the same manufacturer or capable of using the same ammunition does not confer "grade"...

Matel made many of the m16 stocks
so what's that mean for your barbies
we're they "military grade" too? 

See how that conflating thing works...?
5109 2018-02-16 18:38:33 It's not "more capable". And I'm in favor of mag capacity limits and banning bump stocks (what was used in Vegas). I want to make positive change, But you need to know what you're talking about in order to make than change. You thought "semi-auto" sounded scary. It isn't.
5110 2018-02-16 18:38:29 Support S1916 no bump stocks, S2095 Assault weapons ban, S2009 better background checks. Say NO to Concealed Carry Reciprocity. No need and someone is going to get hurt.
5111 2018-02-16 18:37:56 Sir I buyed stocks in mid 2017 not selled still now but  gains gone out in this Jan Feb correction. Still looking at company growth Iam holding all. But feels sad missed some profit. How to overcome this kind of short term thinking. ¡¡¡¡

5117 2018-02-16 18:34:49 Yea funny I remember vegas and what bump stocks do for these guns but thanks to the NRA they are still legal tell me why an item that's only use is to make a semi automatic gun fire in full auto needs to be legal when full auto guns are illegal
5118 2018-02-16 18:34:29 Every American looks good but nonetheless is slated to loose all Money gold stocks in only 60 calendar days. America is going to get on target to be burned to ashes in 62 days...

5124 2018-02-16 18:32:08 It really pisses me off how many people are “conveniently” forgetting about bump stocks in order to defend the AR-15 with “but it’s not automatic”.

Doesn’t matter anyway, as a round from an AR-15 does MUCH more damage to a person than most other guns. Should be illegal.
5125 2018-02-16 18:31:43 @PRyan what will you tell Ms Williams and her classmates?  Will it be: 
Now is not the time? 
or
Gun owners rights over-rule her and her classmates right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness
If this is too soon to talk about #GunViolence then let's talk about bump-stocks
5126 2018-02-16 18:31:40 I don't think blaming anyone is helpful. Why can't we just admit that no one needs large quantities of ammo, bump stocks, and weapons that only police and military should have. This is not hunting
5127 2018-02-16 18:31:37 Look at Airlines stocks
5128 2018-02-16 18:31:09 Do you own any stocks, how about Pelosi, or Menéndez? Also do pension funds own stocks? How about 401ks?
5129 2018-02-16 18:31:08 The sale of assault weapons should be restricted to police, military, CIA, FBI, etc. Additionally, bump stocks, cavalier, bullet proof protective gear, etc,  should also be limited to said parties. If you expect these agencies to decrease violence, then give them the advantage.

5132 2018-02-16 18:29:52 This is so pathetically sad. Our justice system is goign to be the literal laughing stocks of the entire world.
5133 2018-02-16 18:29:44 Agree in principle but how does owning 10 AR-15s, bump stocks and 10000 rounds of ammo maximise one's opportunities?
5134 2018-02-16 18:29:12 Does it matter here that this "statement" by the RCMP is untrue? Or is it sufficient that the misinformation fits with your narrative? Where are the supporting facts? So-called "bump stocks" are illegal in Canada. Standard capacity magazines are illegal in Canada.
5135 2018-02-16 18:29:03 Perhaps one of our most favorite tools is accumulating stocks that are in multi-week base patterns 3 weeks 5 weeks 8 weeks or 13 weeks generally that's when most Traders are giving up and moving on to another play right before the next break out
5136 2018-02-16 18:28:56 Bump stocks don't work with kitchen knives.
5137 2018-02-16 18:28:53 Smash commentators don't use downtime well. Look at football/basketball when a play is over you get an instant replay and the analysis happens there. You get anything like that between games or even stocks in Smash because most commentators not aware enough to use downtime.
5138 2018-02-16 18:28:29 @USCongress @realDonaldTrump 

1st - REVERSE your action that allows  
         mentally ill to purchase guns! 
2nd-  ban bump stocks
3rd - require more in-depth background  
          checks for ALL  gun sales!  Impose  
        similar rules as to operate a vehicle.

5143 2018-02-16 18:25:48 M16 are for those military losers. We have bump stocks. Maybe I should pick up a titan missile while I’m at it.
5144 2018-02-16 18:25:42 Is that because you see weed stocks about to do the fall off cliff + bounce? That's what I see...
5145 2018-02-16 18:25:30 Stocks have risen for the maker of the AR-15 rifle, netting the company additional $8.8 million in one day. The company thanks America for our thoughts and prayers and inaction.
5146 2018-02-16 18:25:26 Target shooting and hunting. Hunt coyotes and deer. They're very versatile semi-auto rifles because it is easy to change calibers to fit different hunting/shooting scenarios. Collapsible stocks allow for proper fit for shooters of various stature or thickness of clothing.
5147 2018-02-16 18:25:06 “Am also working with Congress on many fronts“. Unless this includes a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks, as well as, more funding for mental health, these are empty words. Nothing happened after Las Vegas. WE CANNOT NOT ACT NOW!

5162 2018-02-16 18:19:04 even if a gun rule can't save all lives, it cn save a lot of lives. background checks & banning assault weapons & bump stocks shld be law NOW. Why wld anyone be against background checks? nobody wants to take all your guns away, unless you're mentally ill or a felon.

5180 2018-02-16 18:12:50 The GOP who let the assault rifle ban expire in 2004? 
The GOP that rescinded Obama's bill to restrict sales to mentally ill? 
The GOP that still has not banned bump stocks or 30+ round ammo? 
The GOP that won't close loopholes & pass expanded background checks? 
Yeah, that GOP.
5181 2018-02-16 18:12:50 AND banning RK-15, bump stocks and large capacity magazines. These were developed for killing. People should never have to send a loved one to school or work in the morning and see them in a body bag in the afternoon.  #GunReformNow #GunReformNow #GunReformNow #GunReformNow

5183 2018-02-16 18:11:57 A global recession would be a big risk for stocks. While the global economic cycle is aging, we don’t foresee a global recession taking place in 2018—although that risk may rise in 2019.
5184 2018-02-16 18:11:49 True, but the bump stocks were recent.
5185 2018-02-16 18:11:44 @MeghanMcCain 2nd amendment doesn't mean rights to every type of weapon. & it's about a well formed state militia- we have National Guard. Handgun & hunting rifle, fine. No one outside military & LEO need any-ANY-other type. Nor bump stocks, high capacity clips, piercing ammo.
5186 2018-02-16 18:11:43 Why do we need assault rifles?  Silencers?  Bum stocks? High cap. Magazines?  Please provide an answer. #NRA #GunReformNow #MAGA #hunter
5187 2018-02-16 18:11:41 We could outlaw bump-stocks and clips more easily. The only reason to allow 30-round clips is to fill the air with lead. Unnecessary for home protection or hunting.

5190 2018-02-16 18:10:34 My solution was in my first tweet. Ban semi autos. Ban bump stocks. Vet mentally ill teenagers who buy guns at auction quicker than you buy a slice of pizza. It’s pretty simple. Take the guns off the streets and get them out of the hands of people like this.
5191 2018-02-16 18:10:06 Military doesn’t use bump-stocks. There are approximately 5 BILLION high-capacity magazines in circulation already.

5195 2018-02-16 18:09:31 Have no objection whatsoever to a ban on AR-15s, high-capacity magazines, or bump stocks, but this example is a false equivalence, because driving, unlike bearing arms, is a privilege, not a constitutional right.
5196 2018-02-16 18:09:19 Good to see stocks recovering so people who bought in January have a way out. If anything SELL CALLS on stock you own to reduce risk of another volatility spike. IMO if you're even or positive time to bail for now and explore other investments.
5197 2018-02-16 18:09:03 As we are mourn the loss of 17  more individuals to yet another school shooting, as a parent, I have to ask what more can we do, both as legislators and as citizens. At the very least we must close the gun show
loophole and ban the sale of rapid firing devices, AKA bump-stocks.
5198 2018-02-16 18:08:48 Did I not also mention military grade accessories? High capacity magazines. Bump stocks. Etc.
5199 2018-02-16 18:08:44 Free market?!? That is on another planet somewhere. All US markets maipulated, commerce - stocks - bonds - everything. No real price discovery Thats why market moves so extreme and why we will see stocks collapse and scream upward, intermittently.
5200 2018-02-16 18:08:22 @RepKayGranger: David Hogg, a senior at Douglas High in Parkland, FL, asked me to let you know, as your constituent, that I favor a ban on assault weapons & bump stocks, and universal background checks and a national data base, available to law enforcement, for gun/parts sales.

5204 2018-02-16 18:07:26 okay but do you not agree that if we decrease access to guns, and ban bump stocks etc that it will decrease deaths? it’s common sense. sure, people who truly want to hurt others will still find a way, but it will be more difficult to do so, decreasing these tragedies.

5206 2018-02-16 18:06:09 Enforced bans do help reduce harm.

We can:
Ban bump stocks. Ban high-capacity magazines. Ban citizens without certain levels of security clearance from purchasing weapons of a certain caliber.

Cars didn't used to have seat belts either ...
5207 2018-02-16 18:05:56 Uh, No Paul, that's the spin. but you are incorrect about any news regarding the tax cuts for at least 2 yrs. The rest is just that spin. Stocks are down, inflation is on the rise. You had tax cuts, reform requires a great deal more.
5208 2018-02-16 18:05:48 Right cause that would mean the #NRA would stop your campaign 
Automatic rifles,bump stocks and such have no place in our society!!
We don't live in a war zone/battlefield and they need to be banned!!!

5209 2018-02-16 18:05:31 The @FBI isn’t doing themselves any favors in public favorability. If they were stocks, I’d love to see @AndySwan take on their twitter mentions and tell us how favorable they are. I feel like I should’ve sold stock in them a long time ago though 
5210 2018-02-16 18:04:01 While I am for the 2A, I also believe bump stocks should be illegal, mandatory gun safety/storage training, tougher background checks, written tests, having to recertify every say 2-3 years, and enforcing the laws we have to a better degree. More laws may make people feel better
5211 2018-02-16 18:03:37 What is your goal in donating to the NRA?

Do is it bother you that the @NRAILA gets more funding after these shootings? Does it sit well with you that bushmaster or whomevers stocks soar after these tragedies?
5212 2018-02-16 18:02:29 No large capacity magazines. You don't need that. No bump stocks, you don't need that, no spray and pray weapons like the AR without a very intensive background check. Allow police to confiscate guns from anyone who may be a danger to themselves or others.

5216 2018-02-16 18:00:47 The screens are green: stocks, bonds and the dollar are all up. You don't see that very often, at least not lately
5217 2018-02-16 17:59:57 Absolutely. I said it's not *just* about laws. I do think there are certain guns that absolutely nobody needs. Stricter background checks, longer wait times, closing the gun show loophole, banning bump stocks, but also changing the economics of the gun industry.
5218 2018-02-16 17:59:44 Hmm..ok an AR-15 is a semi-auto gun not an assault weapon. So should we ban all semis. No, I think ur confused on the full contents of the 2nd amendment. Its not just for hunting. (Protection from a gov. Militias or authoritarian gov., to protected ur family) ban bump stocks tho
5219 2018-02-16 17:59:40 Yes, we need to ban assault weapons, bump stocks and large capacity magazines.  Also prohibit mentally ill, domestic violence and terror watch list ppl. And restore the CDC research on gun violence.
5220 2018-02-16 17:59:23 Why is it so difficult for the GOP to tell the truth?

Democrats want a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks (killer weapons) except for military, law enforcement and security.

They want common sense Gun Safety Laws for the sale and ownership of handguns and hunting rifles.
5221 2018-02-16 17:59:11 Which stocks r u eagerly waiting to buy on dips. Mention stock name with the desired levels.
5222 2018-02-16 17:59:08 I should be investing right now in gun stocks there gonna be on sale soon

5224 2018-02-16 17:58:52 Market Update: Stock Market is improving. BTC struggling to maintain 10k position. Most likely due to money flowing back into stocks and alts for quick gains. Looks like investors are diversifying before new money flows in. Key word here is volume.
5225 2018-02-16 17:58:30 If you feel for them? BS.  Bump stocks are still on the shelves.  Probably selling better today.  You feel for them?  NRA member?  GOP supporter.  Wash your hands of the blood.  Support  #GunContolNow .  NRA therapy and prayer group later.  U need it.

5228 2018-02-16 17:58:01 This is a 9/11 situation! Massacres and rampant gun violence. Home grown terrorism. Protocals not followed by FBI, Assault rifles free to buy by anyone in FL. Easier than getting a drivers license.Bump stocks on market.These issues need to be attacked and fixed.
Where's Congress?
5229 2018-02-16 17:57:03 I’ve spoke to a few gun zealots. They think gun control means taking ALL guns. Their dolt like brains can’t comprehend it’s the semi-automatic and automatic ( with bump stocks) that have proven in my city to take massive life and injure hundreds.
5230 2018-02-16 17:56:55 Stocks Up, Bonds Up, Dollar Up. Today is the day nothing is falling except #VIX 
5231 2018-02-16 17:56:33 One of the best imo. Should be safe long term play. Build position if it goes down before summer. That's what I'm doing with a lot of the large cap Canadian pot stocks
5232 2018-02-16 17:56:14 ...or ban bump stocks maybe?  Semi-automatic weapons aren’t the issue...

5235 2018-02-16 17:55:14 1)An AR-15 isn't any different from a hunting rifle beyond cosmetic. 2)The NRA has supported bans on bump stocks which had never been used and flew under everyone's radar. No ban had ever been proposed before. 3)No armor piercing have been used in mass shootings.

5241 2018-02-16 17:54:43 Strict checks when guns are purchased.  Make bump stocks illegal.

5243 2018-02-16 17:54:15 Okay, cars should not be banned. Awful argument anyways. Also again, bump stocks are completely legal under federal law.

5245 2018-02-16 17:53:33 Phony Joni $3.2 million from the NRA. Pro legislation for the mentally ill buy firearms, pro bump stocks, and a supporter of violence in our schools
5246 2018-02-16 17:53:28 Definitely. He is totally right about exchanges needing to adapt before mass adoption can ensue. My 57 year old dad goes cross eyed when he see's me on binance lol. However, he is confident and comfortable selling/buying stocks in the traditional market.
5247 2018-02-16 17:53:19 There are loopholes that allow citizens to legally own fully automatic weapons. People can either modify semi-automatic weapons with bump stocks or they can own automatic weapons so long as they were manufactured before 1986.

5250 2018-02-16 17:52:31 Most people aren't talking about a total ban. Handguns, hunting rifles ok. Silencers, bump stocks, large magazines, rifles made for the mass slaughter of human beings - no. I think the founding fathers could never have imagined what we are dealing with today.
5251 2018-02-16 17:52:12 Dig deeper.. alex jones is a gate keeping ass shill.. yess theres a lot of truth presented there but its still divide and conquer... there is no red or blue only green..
5252 2018-02-16 17:51:46 It is NOT the guns doing the killing! How about all the vans and trucks killing folks around the world by these whacked out radical Islamists should we ban trucks and vans now too??

Abortion is immoral bc it leads to death, but we can't regulate AR-15s or bump stocks bc...?

5255 2018-02-16 17:51:18 Why didn't President Obama do something about gun control when the Dem's had the house and Senate? The NRA want a ban or regulations on bump stocks. I don't care about donations the Dem's take donations from big Corp. and banks, but they hate banks and big business.
5256 2018-02-16 17:51:17 1) let’s ban AR-15’s and/or require documentation for any reason valid to own one.
2) ban accessories such as bump stocks
3) make mental health history a part of all background checks
4) place a minimum of 2 armed guards at all schools

5264 2018-02-16 17:49:47 What’s not sensible about banning bump-stocks, hollow points, high-capacity clips, raising the age requirement for AR-15 purchases, mandating trigger-locks, background checks and fire arms training, closing gun show loopholes or mail-order purchases? Why can’t we talk about this?
5265 2018-02-16 17:49:28 Zafar Islam is just too nice a chap for these media sharks. They bully him literally. BJP had likes of Smirit Irani and Nirmala Sitaramans in run up to 2014. Sir @AmitShah Please take stocks. Our communication team is wobbly. We need to hire sharp shooters now

5267 2018-02-16 17:48:45 It's all good except for bump stocks which you can do by simply pushing the gun into your finger without the assist

Why can’t we talk about this?
5269 2018-02-16 17:48:16 Not to mention that even if you were 100% correct which you are NOT, increasing the value of stocks provides an enormous benefit to the millions of 401k plans held by Americans.
5270 2018-02-16 17:48:01 I just support honesty and the truth! I am no bible thumper but I love God and Alex jones message is treat others as you want to be treated but take no shit from anybody while giving all thanks to God! It’s really that simple
5271 2018-02-16 17:47:39 If an AR-15, high magazines weren’t readily available, at best this wouldn’t have happened and at worst the number of killed would have been worse. These along with bump stocks need to be banned. These are for killing.  Surprised that @foxandfriends  wound be so insensitive
5272 2018-02-16 17:47:36 Yes. And bump stocks. And high capacity magazines.  You can buy any gun you want to in a parking lot in AZ.
5273 2018-02-16 17:47:31 DO SOMETHING you hypocritical piece of shit. Ban Assault Rifles. Ban Bump Stocks. Ban High Capacity Clips. Pretty simple really. Few people need guns that can fire hundreds of bullets in seconds. Do. Something. Now.
5274 2018-02-16 17:47:02 not trying to debate with you just asking a question which you clearly avoided! The gun stocks used in multiple of the past shooting are illegal bc of the fact that it uses the recoil to fire almost, if not as fast as an automatic rifle.

5281 2018-02-16 17:45:49 You are irrational, and part of the problem. We will never stop all senseless deaths by assholes. But we certainly can minimize some of them. I am not for banning all guns. Only assault weapons, bump stocks and ghost guns. Roll back Brady Bill, passed under Reagan.
5282 2018-02-16 17:45:44 That's all that's been done. Even bump stocks from the last mass shooting have not moved from committee. Republicans just add to debt.

5285 2018-02-16 17:44:37 Awesome. Quality swing trade.
5286 2018-02-16 17:43:39 my plan- ban assault weapons/bump stocks. Ban US terror watch list and people with mental health issues from buying any gun. stricter background and mental health checks.  National registry for gun owners. mandatory yearly training. no sales at gun shows
5287 2018-02-16 17:43:39 The general process of shooting:
-  Shooting
- Candlelight commemorative party
- Psychologists and sociologists analyze & Media
- Members of the media debate (concluding that guns are innocent)
- Gun stocks rose sharply
- Gun sales are bullish
- White House defended gun rights.
5288 2018-02-16 17:43:30 There is no need for civilians to have assault rifles or bump stocks.

5291 2018-02-16 17:42:08 Marco if AR-15 weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines were banned it would at LEAST mitigated the number of deaths and injuries.

5307 2018-02-16 17:39:03 Can we at least limit magazine size and outlaw bumper stocks? Can we at least make people wait one week for a background check and make it illegal for fugitives to buy guns? #Resistance #ImpeachTrump #NotMyPresident #Resist #Trump #VoteThemOut2018 #BlueTsunami #StrongerTogether

5309 2018-02-16 17:38:01 I’ve heard it from 2 reliable sources that the stocks of AR-15s emit a synthetic estrogen that causes the user to develop female characteristics (breast enlargement, high voice, testicle shrinkage, etc.) This should speed up the buyback.

5313 2018-02-16 17:36:45 of course I know that. I'm refuting ol' Joey's point up there. The health of the stock market doesn't mean shit for the average American, just the wealthiest 20% or so who own the majority of stocks.

5315 2018-02-16 17:36:21 This isn’t rocket science, and we’re sick of the endless “conversation”.  We want a ban on military-style weapons, a ban on bump stocks, reinstatement of Obama’s tighter regulations on gun access for people with mental health issues that was reversed by Trump last year!

5320 2018-02-16 17:35:01 Who cares as long as stocks go to ATHs.
5321 2018-02-16 17:34:57 Where do you stand on bump stocks?  Large capacity magazines?  Hollow-point bullets? Is the right to bear arms completely unfettered?
5322 2018-02-16 17:34:18 no sir i’m on stocks. why!
5323 2018-02-16 17:34:16 They think we're going to take their guns away from them. They want their semi-automatic rifles so when the government comes for them. The government has nukes tanks weapons we don't know about. Give up your semi-automatic weapons they need to be banned along with bump stocks
5324 2018-02-16 17:34:15 You were terrible on that show. You sir showed your true ignorance on the subject of guns. In one breath you acknowledge gun control does nothing, then say we need to ban bump stocks. What a shill. You don’t represent me

5327 2018-02-16 17:32:58 How about some common sense gun control laws?
No one needs automatic rifles.

No one needs bump stocks.

No guns for mentally ill.
5328 2018-02-16 17:32:57 Don't miss KBW Global Head of Research Fred Cannon on @CNBC @PowerLunch today discussing how rising interest rates impact bank stocks, at 2:10pm ET.
5329 2018-02-16 17:32:52 AR15 stands for ArmaLite Rifle which is company who developed in 50s. Its semi-auto not auto which is assault rifles. Bump stocks used in Vegas should never be allowed but that wasnt used here

5331 2018-02-16 17:32:20 Assault weapons. High capacity clips, bump stocks. Ask for a general ban. No more asking for a minimum and getting nothing. Ask for everything and see what their counter is. #artofthedeal
5332 2018-02-16 17:32:00 !Australia solved their gun safety by banning assault weapons and bump stocks and keeping the mentally ill weaponfree
5333 2018-02-16 17:31:50 Universal background checks, ban assault rifles, ban bump stocks...there's a lot you could do but you, the NRA and politicians have done nothing. The blood is on all of your hands...
5334 2018-02-16 17:31:35 Ramaphosa: We have seen moderate improvement in our economy, commodity prices have improved, stocks have improved, Zar has strengthen, investor confidence is on the rise #SONA2018
5335 2018-02-16 17:31:12 Do any of you idiot NRA members realize that when the second amendment was written you had to be really lucky to get off two shots in one minute  do you really think the forefathers were talking about AR-15s with bump stocks. SHUT THE HELL UP
5336 2018-02-16 17:31:09 No one is banning guns but only proposing common sense changes. Mental health screening, no extended magazines or bump stocks, and no semi automatics like the AR 15 with a high rate of fire.
5337 2018-02-16 17:29:55 I want to slap the ask X 3
5338 2018-02-16 17:29:55 Prove them wrong. Create  background checks, prevent the mentally ill from obtaining guns, ban the AR-15, and ban bump stocks.
5339 2018-02-16 17:29:55 Tanks would be more equivalent to a automatic rifle. Which are illegal. Thats why things like bump stocks need to be banned, its like turning a McLaren into a tank. But in the end, if someone wants to kill alot of people, they will find a way. Whether its a semi truck or a gun.

5343 2018-02-16 17:29:18 @ScottWapnerCNBC  Sullivan doing a great job putting Weiss in his place with uneducated comments. Weiss lacks common sense & can’t analyze markets or stocks as his poor track record shows. 80% of his picks failed.
5344 2018-02-16 17:29:16 Nothing  will be done about this. These Republicans are not going to go up against the NRA and it's an election year so they fear they will anger the rabid gun owners who think we want to take away everything. Not true just AR-15 and bump stocks. Disgusting
5345 2018-02-16 17:29:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo

5347 2018-02-16 17:28:54 @GOPSenMajority @realDonaldTrump Not looking good. Want immediate boost in the polls?! Ban assault weapons, lg magazines, bump stocks today!! The majority of the US, even gun owners, will applaud.
5348 2018-02-16 17:28:53 Yes, you can do something. How about banning bump stocks turning the AR into what is an illegal automatic? After Las Vegas, gun dealers cannot keep them in stock. That is a good first step. I support the 2nd Amendment, not mass killing.
5349 2018-02-16 17:27:52 Love the wood stocks, but other then that it's a standard set up for an MP5.

5352 2018-02-16 17:26:59 Yikes. Trouble is so many big brands sell in China. The high Street is not great for cruelty free. Superdrug stocks quite a few CF brands apparently.
5353 2018-02-16 17:26:52 GOP Spin City, ad nauseum. They'll talk like they're going to do something but NEVER do.

Rifle Bump Stocks were supposed to be regulated after Las Vegas massacre. NOTHING WAS EVER DONE!

5354 2018-02-16 17:26:38 He had hardships. His wife said they had to sacrafice and sell some stocks when he was in college. In my case I worked two jobs to pay my way through college. How the hell can he relate to people and what sacrifice is about?
5355 2018-02-16 17:26:10 So, beating the NRA to me means allowing its paid for lobbied lawmakers to make sensible laws without fear of recourse from the NRA. Ending bump stocks, high capacity magazines, trade show loopholes...that helps keep us safe.
5356 2018-02-16 17:25:24 We are never going to agree on the gun issue at least not 100% however I do have some leeway in stricter gun laws and mental checks before purchasing and absolutely no bump stocks.
5357 2018-02-16 17:25:08 And they still ranged them. They just changed out the scary tactical for wood stocks and left their high cap mags at home.
5358 2018-02-16 17:24:49 Which is of course false. They support bump stocks being illegal and no one proposed banning them prior to their use. It was on one one's radar. Military grade weapons are illegal and the NRA supports that. Please try facts.
5359 2018-02-16 17:24:19 Of course they should.  Reinstate the assault rifle ban, since that language has already been worked out, add bumb stocks and magazines.  No one should have more fire power than our protection agencies.
5360 2018-02-16 17:24:14 been prescient for about 4 months and unemployment has dropped, stocks have gone up, employment rates have gone up, more companies are coming to america, etc.
5361 2018-02-16 17:24:13 Silencers are a misnomer and not a real thing. Suppressors are for hearing protection. Bump stocks are a waste of money. So wrong across the board.
5362 2018-02-16 17:23:57 No semi automatic weapons for civilians, raise gun age to 21, national registry, all sales require background check, mental health screening prior to purchase, waiting period, no bump stocks, no weapon modification kits. I am just a mom and can think of this in 1 minute.
5363 2018-02-16 17:23:46 There is no need for bump stocks. Ban them. Corporate interests should not continue to over shadow the best interests of our communities or the environmental health.
5364 2018-02-16 17:23:46 @HalftimeReport Market going down &THEN straight back up, did nothing to discount concerns of rising rates, inflation &stocks ahead of Fed action, deficit increases, etc.  We now retraced back to the 40&50-day mov avg, so we'll see if we go back to the top or consolidate more.
5365 2018-02-16 17:23:46 The only way is to sell your stocks. Its going to go down.

Asking for a (dead) friend.

5370 2018-02-16 17:23:00 Everyone wants to find and own big winners. Do you have a specific, proven process to FIND winners before they break out? Then, do you have a process to buy? A process to sell? (Video coming) #stocks #investing

5372 2018-02-16 17:22:51 after some of the worst economic data in years or decades that strongly implies caution/risk, the VIX runs from 8 to 50 to 17 with stocks in hyper mode again. Buyers can be stupid but holders are being extremely greedy
5373 2018-02-16 17:22:11 Incorrect. GOP (and the NRA!) we’re both open to banning “bump” stocks, but the measure died when Democrats overreached and wanted to add additional measures (like hi-cap magazines) into the effort. R and D were in agreement until D went too far.
5374 2018-02-16 17:22:03 Kind of like his advice to buy dividend paying stocks yet he doesn't pay one?
5375 2018-02-16 17:22:00 More extensive background checks. A ban on high capacity magazines, a ban on bump stocks, an assault weapons ban...
5376 2018-02-16 17:21:44 il vaut mieux éviter de revacciner, déjà pour pas épuiser les stocks inutilement et deuxièmement parce ce qu'on sait pas trop ce que ça donne d'en faire plus.
5377 2018-02-16 17:21:41 Ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, ban high-capacity magazines, demand background checks, and do not sell guns to people with a history of mental illness or violence.
5378 2018-02-16 17:21:35 The top stocks lower at noon today are $VFC, $CBOE, $VMC. $KHC, and $CPB.
5379 2018-02-16 17:21:17 Let’s all make sure that we are not, even inadvertently, supporting the NRA or gun manufacturers at this point. You may be surprised that gun stocks are widely held in stock portfolios, including many 401k and mutual funds. Call your fund managers and dump these stocks!
5380 2018-02-16 17:21:14 This isn’t rocket science, and we’re sick of the endless “conversation”.  We want a ban on military-style weapons, a ban on bump stocks, reinstatement of Obama’s tighter regulations on gun access for people with mental health issues that was reversed by Trump last year!
5381 2018-02-16 17:21:01 I really need someone to teach me about stocks

5384 2018-02-16 17:20:01 Once correlations get lower then you have to find who leads each market leg higher. But, usually, when stocks drop, everything drops and bounces again which leads to higher correlations
5385 2018-02-16 17:19:20 Bump stocks I care nothing for, ban em if that’s what they want to do. 

No fly violates due process. 

AR 10 is fine for hunting. AR 15 in 5.56 is perfect for varmint control.

5457 2018-02-16 17:14:26 Good attempt at deflection. Try to focus on our gun laws or lack thereof which is what this convo was about. Can you give me a good reason why anyone would need an AR-15 or bump stocks other than "it's your right"?
5458 2018-02-16 17:14:24 That's the point, most people are not against gun ownership. They're against these assault weapons, bump stocks, etc. The problem in this country is not gun ownership, it's gun weapons.
5459 2018-02-16 17:14:15 Columbine happened with the ban in place. I’m not saying stuff should stay the same thing. I’m for getting rid of bump stocks. I’m for not allowing people with high risk mental health issues getting a gun. This kid passed background checks. If the FBI would’ve....
5460 2018-02-16 17:14:11 Universal background checks, ban bump stocks, ban semi auto rifles except at gun ranges, fully fund mental health services and prevent those with serious mental health problems. Allow CDC  & other medical experts to study gun deaths. Half come from suicides.

5463 2018-02-16 17:13:38 Assault rifle refers to a selective fire weapon, attachments like bump stocks actually transform semi-automatic weapons like an AR-15 into a selective fire weapon

A BILL to band Bump Stocks? Murders dont care-Bump Stocks can easily be made BAN AK15's & other auto's-GUN's can be easily converted
#msnbc #FoxNews
5472 2018-02-16 17:10:35 That's not what I'm insinuating. I'm insinuating we do everything reasonably possible to prevent people inclined to murder from being able to kill multiple people at a time. Right now, fully automatic weapons and bump stocks seem like total no-brainers.
5473 2018-02-16 17:09:45 I am not against the second amendment or guns, but am strongly in favor of stricter gun control laws and enforcement. There really is no place in our country for private citizens owning assault rifles or bump stocks or silencers. Congress show some courage!

5476 2018-02-16 17:09:27 You are right its too soon to talk after parkland. How about banning bump stocks after Vegas? Is that still too soon? Nothing got done. Why dont you address that first and after the next mas shooting we can discuss parkland
5477 2018-02-16 17:09:26 $smrn @Papa_Stocks
5478 2018-02-16 17:09:23 They don’t want to change all the gun laws because of all the money these corporations pay, the politicians are puppets and want the same because they’re on their payroll. Stocks for guns go up during a shooting because people are scared and buy more.

5484 2018-02-16 17:08:33 But that's exactly what you and your party has done after every mass shooting. Even bump stocks are still legal! Shame
5485 2018-02-16 17:08:26 It's time that Congress remembers that you work for the people not the gun lobbies.  Protect our children now!  Pass legislation making military assault style weapons illegal except for active military and law enforcement.  Ban bump stocks!  Tighten gun laws so that people with
5486 2018-02-16 17:08:18 I own no guns but I believe most of these guns you can’t hunt with and make bad home defense. No need for large clips or bump stocks. Longer wait period for all guns just makes sense.

5498 2018-02-16 17:06:25 But its your job to make laws.  You have to start somewhere.  Bring back the assualt ban.  Ban bump stocks,  full and hard background checks.  Those kids had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  The 2nd am was written for a musket.  Grow a spine
5499 2018-02-16 17:06:19 @jimcramer @ReformedBroker @RiskReversal guys check out the redemptions of dynamic buy write ETF’s. They are high. That means dealers who provide hedges are short back month calls and scrambling to cover.  That is driving stocks higher
5500 2018-02-16 17:06:15 Explain bump stocks. Silencers, fair. Limits on ammo can be reasonable, I suppose. Stops stockpiling for incidents such as these. Sales backtracking 100%. Background checks can still be circumvented.
5501 2018-02-16 17:06:14 every biotech is a story stocks..
5502 2018-02-16 17:05:51 What you said is though theoretically possible, but highly unlikely. More likely scenario is rising demand for these stocks due to popularization of smallcap "pig shorting" strategies in recent years. Just like @timothysykes popularized OTC P&Ds, which later became overcrowded

5505 2018-02-16 17:04:56 They lobbied Congress to allow sales of dangerous weapons to people who SHOULD NOT have access to bump stocks, high-capacity killing machines, unlimited rounds. Sensible Americans are SICK of the carnage wreaked on our children - promoted/enabled by NRA extremists.

5510 2018-02-16 17:03:29 Fact is no one wants to take away your guns. But the AR-15 and others like like it are weapons of mass destruction, made even more dangerous with things like bump stocks, which, I should say, Congress failed to ban after after the Vegas massacre, even after vowing to do so

Everyone appeared to agree that bump stocks, which make a semiauto basically behave exactly like an illegal full auto, should be banned. Y’all got yourselves thru the news cycle, then DID NOTHING!

5524 2018-02-16 17:00:28 The NRA classifies bump stocks as an accessory intended to help disabled people shoot assault rifles. WTF
5525 2018-02-16 17:00:07 That's also more of an issue with bump stocks which I'm 100% in support if banning
5526 2018-02-16 17:00:02 The idea that arming teachers will prevent school shootings is almost as absurd as the idea that banning bump stocks will prevent school shootings.
5527 2018-02-16 16:59:44 Limits on ammo, background checks, better records with sales (especially private sales), stringent processes for bump stocks, silencers, etc.
5528 2018-02-16 16:59:26 stocks too strong

5530 2018-02-16 16:58:56 I think there are degrees of personal involvement in a business. From a sole proprietorship, to family business, to privately held stocks, to being an ant in a billion dollar (excuse me, pound) global enterprise

5534 2018-02-16 16:58:25 Stocks* xD
5535 2018-02-16 16:57:57 Your paranoia makes the prospect of you being armed very  worrisome.
If we can’t get rid of bump stocks banning guns is thousands of years down the road.
5536 2018-02-16 16:57:43 trade wars are good for stocks because they create more uncertainty which risk market likes
5537 2018-02-16 16:57:40 So this wildly touted $TSLA bull byline that "if only $TSLA were not investing so much, it would be wildly profitable - wildly I'm telling you" just shows you that $TSLA bulls have no business investing in individual stocks.
5538 2018-02-16 16:56:43 1) good then we can agree to eliminate things like bump stocks and large magazines
2) “a WELL REGULATED militia”
3) nobody is trying to take your guns; just weapons of war
4) then why make anything illegal, if that’s the case?
5539 2018-02-16 16:56:42 Tell me, what is an AR-15? I don't think that you know the solid definition. An argument can be made against bump stocks, yes. But not against all modifications.
5540 2018-02-16 16:56:32 He doesn't drive, so doesn't have to pay it..all so more money for his oil stocks
5541 2018-02-16 16:56:32 Pretty sure you can already bring a civil suit against a company for a defective product. Bump stocks and trigger locks are an entirely separate issue, but I'm not opposed to regulation in principle.

5543 2018-02-16 16:56:02 I wonder if @PRyan has "all the facts" about bump-stocks.  What will it take? Will it take one of his family being shot by a lunatic with a gun?

Paul, Las Vegas massacre was last October. What bill have you allowed to come to the floor to ban bump-stocks?

5546 2018-02-16 16:55:33 GOP says: “We’re with you , Florida.” True. If you’re a shooter.  They’re doing everything they can to make it easier for shooters. AR-15? Yup. Background check? No need. Domestic abuser?  No problem. Bump stocks? Still legal. So, yeah, the GOP is with you. If you’re a shooter.

5552 2018-02-16 16:54:22 Rule of 72. It's an approximation in Finance for how many years it takes to double your money given a certain return. 10% return on stocks. 72/10= 7.2. So approximately 7.2 years to double your money if you got that return. So his returns were huge starting with 1mil to billions
5553 2018-02-16 16:54:21 Less access = less opportunity = less deaths. Less legal access to assault rifle type guns or bump stocks etc = less deaths. Less loopholes in gun laws = less access = less deaths. Everything adds up. You don’t have to take all guns to make a difference.
5554 2018-02-16 16:54:12 Historically that is what has happened in early stages of a bond bear market. Some money flows into stocks on the belief that economy is still strong enough to offset raising rates. At some point that stops when rates are high enough to be attractive.
5555 2018-02-16 16:54:09 Not ask him questions, question what he does and teaches. If it holds water then listen to it. Question what everyone tries to tell you. Some people have different motives, like financial planners. They sell you stocks and insurance, and you should question to listen to sales men

5557 2018-02-16 16:53:39 Peter you are presenting logical arguments and for that, I can’t be mad at you. On the topics of stocks, climate, healthcare, etc I would prefer to hear from an expert. The thing is - politics is about every single one of us. We need EVERYBODY’s opinion.
5558 2018-02-16 16:53:39 Oh rly? So how come you didn't buy #facebook and #amazon stocks back then 
5559 2018-02-16 16:53:22 As econ grows, wages grow, interest rate must go up... money leaves stocks and enters bonds.  Yes.  Perfectly normal

5561 2018-02-16 16:53:10 Bump stocks and AR-15s have been around forever? Wake up.
5562 2018-02-16 16:52:33 In some instances, yes. Bump-stocks, still legal.
5563 2018-02-16 16:52:32 YES!!! Ban automatic and semi automatic long guns and hand guns! And while you’re at it...ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines!! Oh...and 2nd Amendment MY ASS...call it what it is...gun owners like their guns more than they want to save the lives of children!!
5564 2018-02-16 16:51:56 Remember the worst mass shooting in US history in Las Vegas? 58 dead, 850 injured. Remember how the conversation wasn't even about banning AR-15's but just banning bump stocks that make them shoot faster? Yea they're still legal. Congress ain't gonna do shit.
5565 2018-02-16 16:51:52 Well then give me facts that he not Obama got the economy going. Go back to what obama came into 9 yrs ago. And he turned it all around. That is a fact. Trump is riding the wave. And with the tax cuts to the wealthy they will boost the stocks. It’s all show! Talk later need to go
5566 2018-02-16 16:51:47 When I traded stocks and oil I was a nobody... I still am a nobody but I have earned over a dozen bitcoins just for sharing my knowledge. Crypto breaks the barriers & brings out our best. The creativity in this cult is incredible. Crypto competition pushes us to better ourselves
5567 2018-02-16 16:51:37 A ban on assault style guns and bump stocks, background checks, enforcement of current regulations and laws is not equivalent to repealing the 2nd Amendment.  Serious people are not asking to repeal the 2nd Amendment - stop gas lighting
5568 2018-02-16 16:51:33 My personal experience - it’s difficult to get contra trend trades right. You need capacity to be in position for a long time with good risk management skills. Look for stocks already in dn trend & short at bounce.
5569 2018-02-16 16:51:12 No offense but the whole gun debate disgusts me at this point. If we didn’t get any common sense legislation after Sandy Hook when Obama was president, what makes anyone think we can get one now?

Have they even banned bump stocks yet? We have in WA state.

Ban bump stocks. That is the NRA's way around automatic weapons.
Ban magazines.
5577 2018-02-16 16:50:31 Yeah, that pissed me off. Bump stocks are crap for any sort of reasonable, intentional shooting in the first place. That ban should've been an easy win.

5590 2018-02-16 16:47:24 Well the banning of bump-stocks foundered after a couple of weeks :(
5591 2018-02-16 16:47:15 $thds @Papa_Stocks
5592 2018-02-16 16:47:06 @NRA is giving Janine money 2 tell people that shoot outs are the answer- this isn't the Wild Wild West! The #NRA just wants 2 sell more guns, bullets, bump Stocks anything to make a dollar off of our dead children. If we can't ban assault weapons as a 1st step we have failed!
5593 2018-02-16 16:47:04 Richest 1% own 40% of stocks....
5594 2018-02-16 16:47:02 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Still no action on bump stocks or background checks. How many bodies do you need to see to stand up to NRA?
5595 2018-02-16 16:46:55 I think you mean stock indexes. I also prefer stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate investment trusts. But people make money in different ways. 50 times richer running 4million into billions is not a good ROI? I think you better check your math. Hint rule of 72
5596 2018-02-16 16:46:50 Yes, assault weapons must be banned! Also large magazines, and bump stocks. Universal backround checks and registration for guns.
5597 2018-02-16 16:46:46 We don't have to try and boil the ocean. There will always be people with bad intent. But we can choose to not empower that intent with AR-15s and bump stocks. Massive no-brainer IMO.
5598 2018-02-16 16:46:42 FWIW: Bridgewater further reduced short bets in DAX stocks (2nd day now). For example Siemens from 0.9% (Feb 8) to 0.86% (Feb 12) to 0.78% (Feb 15)

5631 2018-02-16 16:45:51 So much for dry January, quite a few stocks are bouncing rather nicely into February. Long may it continue. Same thing happened last year 
5632 2018-02-16 16:45:31 It seems to me that if the FBI is asking him to stop making death threats on twitter, maybe twitter should do something. I don't care about either of these stocks, but I also don't need any more threats.
5633 2018-02-16 16:45:29 ZERO chance that happens. And really a stupid comment just for clicks.  Pro gun ownership is a right and A NEED.  Be real with something like bump stocks and high magazine capacity becoming illegal to the public.

5636 2018-02-16 16:44:48 .@RepMcSally @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @GOP @TheDemocrats We need to update and modernize the "arms" the the 2nd Amendment guarantees Americans the right to possess. Individuals can be well armed w/out semi-automatic & automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. #GunReformNow #Parkland
5637 2018-02-16 16:44:43 Yep common sense approach. And ban AR-15s bump stocks. And ur right ech school thru out our country need to implement btter security fr their campuses.

5639 2018-02-16 16:44:16 When I suggested this month's pull back in stocks was one to buy because of the lack of stress in credit markets, some bears told me this time was different.... 

when the bond market speaks, I listen. mirite? @Convertbond
5640 2018-02-16 16:44:06 Ah, but, they were banned and GOP Congress refused to renew ban in place since the 80s. The GOP refused to consider a bill banning bump stocks. The GOP needs donations from the NRA, and ad's the NRA pays for against their opponents in 2018. #stvalentinesdaymassacre
5641 2018-02-16 16:43:27 Agree with ALL you said. We need universal background checks for guns & ammo owners,national database, federal assault weapons ban, ban bump stocks modifications. Congress & trump just weakened laws making it hard for mentally ill to buy guns! Why?? Not just mental health issue!
5642 2018-02-16 16:43:21 How about some common sense gun control laws?
No one needs automatic rifles.

No one needs bump stocks.

No guns for mentally ill.
5643 2018-02-16 16:43:00 They also apparently don’t understand the procedural requirements to Amend the Constitution. They can’t get 60 votes in the Senate to ban bump stocks, but sure they can get a 2/3rds majority of the House & Senate, AND 3/4 of State Legislatures to ratify a repeal the 2nd. GTFOH
5644 2018-02-16 16:42:54 Breadth us poised to make a new high before stocks...
5645 2018-02-16 16:42:51 How will they get better from worse draft picks? The gap between haves & have nots would only increase. 

The Warriors and Cavs were laughing stocks until they drafted their MVP’s.

2-3 teams gaming the draft process is the far lesser evil than total competitive imbalance.
5646 2018-02-16 16:42:40 MARCO, If you WANT BETTER Press Coverage, stop Thwarting Gun Reforms. One Vote. Add AR-15s & Bump Stocks to the Existing Banned Weapons List. It's a START!

5648 2018-02-16 16:42:21 The 2 most important stocks during the run up into the crash were AMZN and JPM. That they can sit out the rally on the 6th day and let everything else lift the market is - again - very 2017. Back in the rational bullish vortex.
5649 2018-02-16 16:42:15 We should consider reinstating assault weapons ban, or at minimum banning bump stocks and large magazines. Can we restrict military weapons/ammo to military/police? Tommy gun ban has been effective, could add "modifications to approximate" machine guns to it.
5650 2018-02-16 16:42:11 One guy tried to light his shoe on fire while on a plane and now every single one of us has to take our shoes off before flying. You assholes can’t even ban bump stocks. #theNRAisaterroristorganization
5651 2018-02-16 16:41:41 *at rally*

“What do we want?”

“A series of comprehensive reforms on gun control, including but not limited to enhanced background checks, reinstituting the ban on assault rifles, and a ban on bump stocks and silencers!”
5652 2018-02-16 16:41:32 Ive read that he purchased bump stocks to make the semi automatics fire as a fully automatic, which is illegal, but do u think that a person needs 33 assault rifles regardless? Shouldn’t they be watched closely after such a grandiose purchase?
5653 2018-02-16 16:41:01 Stocks bounced back but is it like dead cat bouncing??? As wary investors away Trump Tax cuts impact on inflation, Fed rate hike, Brexit , North Korea

5658 2018-02-16 16:40:32 $UAA was smart. Came out with earnings early to capture a lot of other retail stocks like $NKE. 

When $NKE pop to 70+ , $UAA will recover all the shorts (no pun intended).
5659 2018-02-16 16:39:27 @HappeningNow @EthanBerman has legitimate pt re bump stocks, assault weapons, & sale of huge quantities of ammunition should require background chk. If govt. can limit sale of Allegra-D, it can limit ammun.! + if we limit drink’g age to 21,
5660 2018-02-16 16:38:56 we are required to take so many tests and training to get a drivers license because of the recognition that cars can be dangerous. I see guns the same way. I think that there should be a ban on bump stocks, and better tracking of the flow of weapons
5661 2018-02-16 16:38:48 Bump stocks easily turn any semi-auto rifle into fully automatic. And they are legal.

Oh - and I believe that all assault style weapons should be banned for general sale to the public.
5662 2018-02-16 16:38:19 the basic target functions of "investing" in stocks, bonds, or commodities is REALLY simple= "Buy Low then Sell High" ..the definition of what is LOW & HIGH is impacted by whether you're a short or medium or long term investor but the notion you buy & HOLD (NEVER SELL) is MORONiC

THAT's ALL THEY HAVE!
Words don't bring back dead children. Hunters don't hunt with semi-automatic weapons & they don't need bump-stocks to kill deer, elk, bear, duck, javalina, quail, etc...Words don't help!
5665 2018-02-16 16:37:50 (1) Close background check loopholes for online sales and gun shows, (2) strengthen policies to keep guns out of hands of domestic abusers (starting with closing the boyfriend loophole), (3) ban bump stocks, and...
5666 2018-02-16 16:37:36 Don’t overtrade in the markets. You’ll not only waste time trying to scalp for minuscule gains, but you’ll be blinded to the larger picture move. 

Embrace the ebb and flows of the market. Otherwise you’ll go crazy as your 1 min chart reverses on you.

5668 2018-02-16 16:36:49 this time it was easy (brag brag)... when SPY held 200sma on daily retrace from lo-hi was clear.. after a sharp pullback minimum we can expect is 50% . byt he time market catches up 618 is right there. strong stocks out perform.. like $AMZN $NFLX who were above 50sma on daily.
5669 2018-02-16 16:36:35 Weed stocks all setup to go much lower.
5670 2018-02-16 16:36:22 YES!!  And bump stocks or any other device that transforms a gun into an automatic weapon.
5671 2018-02-16 16:36:22 That's right jake you have to trade where the action is when penny stocks run again well be all over them
5672 2018-02-16 16:36:01 They can. It’s not always successful but if defect in the gun or perhaps the use of enhancements like bump stocks to make the gun more lethal. Would probably lead to safer products and more use of trigger locks. Criminal case doesn’t preclude civil case.
5673 2018-02-16 16:36:00 Divestment campaigns (apartheid, oil, etc all the way back to their origins w/ nuns & "sin"-stocks) originate in an affront to investors' core values. Unclear where this affront comes from when FB's problem= pitting value systems against one another instead of pushing one itself.
5674 2018-02-16 16:35:40 1) There are unique circumstances to every mass shooting. For example, if we banned bump stocks, it wouldn't have stopped this shooting. There are many examples of how proposed laws wouldn't have stopped other mass shootings.
5675 2018-02-16 16:35:38 The way these  stocks are going 
I just might be able to buy a house.... 

Well have enough for a down payment....
5676 2018-02-16 16:35:37 @RepKenBuck:  please HELP stop A.R, bump stocks, etc.  Combat weapons of mass destruction not needed for self protection,  or hunting. Put limits on # of guns per person. Call it collecting instead of a murders arsenal is BS.
NRA supports murder liars all
Congress is complacent.

5678 2018-02-16 16:35:21 Not black bass as you originally said,also it's proposed ban is due to preserving fish stocks so they can recover and fish for when they are more numerous
5679 2018-02-16 16:34:50 @CryptoTschetter Was wondering what stocks to invest in these times? Excluding cryptos.
5680 2018-02-16 16:34:44 think there is room for both styles, it´s just unfair to declare investing in "growth" stocks as challenging the value investing principles, or whatever.
5681 2018-02-16 16:34:39 The problem is that "gun control" has become synonymous to "gun confiscation" to the right. Both sides want safety, both would support measures like banning jump stocks. But all too often the message from the Left is, "We need gun control now!" without saying what specifically.
5682 2018-02-16 16:34:14 My daughter (Sr Myers Park) just sent text about how sad it was at school today going over (again) what to do if a shooter enters. All I could say ‘you and your friends are 18 now. Vote.’ When Congress can’t pass a bipartisan bill on bump stocks after Vegas, they all need to go.
5683 2018-02-16 16:33:42 Enterprise stocks are really on fire ... multiples absolutely nuts but who am I to company
5684 2018-02-16 16:33:27 Woah woah we’re talking about different stocks lol I’m $UAV SORRY !!!
5685 2018-02-16 16:33:04 @EthanBearman  You are correct about protecting the 2nd Amendment.  People need to know the NRA supports gun safety, ban on bump stocks, extensive background checks.  NRA does not promote gun violence.They promote safety and the right of self defense as stated in the constitution
5686 2018-02-16 16:33:01 STCC? USEI?
5687 2018-02-16 16:32:49 ...that is part of high homiced rate in US.  Doesn’t explain mass shootings or school shootings done w legally purchased guns. There should be background checks, and maybe a 30 day “cooling off” period like Australia, ban bump stocks. I don’t know...
5688 2018-02-16 16:32:36 There was an article about WPG and CBL in the WSJ few days ago...fund managers they interviewed think both stocks cheap. Meanwhile, 13F’s show Bill Miller’s fund added to CBL last quarter and maintained its stake in WPG. It is from Yahoo WPG Conversations
5689 2018-02-16 16:32:28 Modifying the weapon to become fully automatic is also illegal. Bump stocks should be made illegal as well. If you are ignorant on the subject of bump stocks, your friend google will be glad to help you out.
5690 2018-02-16 16:32:18 PRAYING is not the answer unless it's followed up with actions like legislation. No one needs bump stocks, AR-15's and 230 magazines! NO ONE PAUL!
5691 2018-02-16 16:32:12 Some stocks sitting at very key levels of bottom support now imo. Thinking they get a bounce from here in the afternoon, but if support breaks, look out.
5692 2018-02-16 16:31:48 On top of that I see no reason for bump stocks to exist, automatic weapons are a whole other issue, but the bump stocks are a common theme in the mass killings. This is an easy fix that is incredibly still not being discussed by the people who have the power to change it.
5693 2018-02-16 16:31:46 @SenGaryPeters ban assault rifles and bump stocks now
5694 2018-02-16 16:31:19 @SenStabenow ban assault rifles and bump stocks now
5695 2018-02-16 16:30:57 Nobody cares about the GOP prayers. This keeps up and every parent will vote you our. All of you that refuse to get the AR15s and bump stocks made illegal. The blood of these children is on Congress.
5696 2018-02-16 16:30:51 Also if you’re talking about bump stocks, they should be outlawed. The real failure was in the background check allowing a young person with documented mental illness to purchase any firearm.
5697 2018-02-16 16:30:38 the @RobinhoodApp looks more and more like the future of trading...side by side analysis of stocks and crypto. this is a millennial investors honeypot. i recommend it.
5698 2018-02-16 16:30:32 nobody needs AR-15's or bump stocks. We have cowards and criminals in office.
5699 2018-02-16 16:30:13 Did the government ever ban bump stocks? I'm gonna guess no, because just like every other shooting, public outrage fizzes out after a while and nothing ever gets done.
5700 2018-02-16 16:30:01 GOP needs to man up and stop being a vehicle for NRA money and start putting kids first. Read the 2nd amendment, no mention of AR-15 or Bump stocks.  You get a shingle shot rifle.
5701 2018-02-16 16:30:00 great call on the bounce.  I'm looking to short stocks that did not bounce given the market is at a bit of resistance, also long ABBV, TEAM
5702 2018-02-16 16:29:54 Will the Wall Street Help in bringing the stocks of Gun Companies go down thereby affecting the NRA even though it may be a very long shot... #NoGuns, #nogunsinourcommunity
5703 2018-02-16 16:29:52 UBS lapped up Fortis ,there is something about hospital stocks this year , earlier societe generale took stake in it @ 141 on feb 2018  . Clsa upgraded apollo hospial today . when everything is bad about it currently  FII Buying stake in it .
5704 2018-02-16 16:29:38 It's not "converted" though, it's using your fingers in such a way that the recoil pushes the gun forward. Are you being obtuse for some reason to score points? If bump stocks are so dangerous, why doesn't everyone use them to commit crimes?
5705 2018-02-16 16:29:28 I agree bump stocks need to be regulated or banned
5706 2018-02-16 16:29:19 Nice trade I been watching those high price stocks getting comfortable with the support/resistance lately those have been trading much better then cheaper stocks I think now I’ll actually trade them
5707 2018-02-16 16:29:17 That's a definite YES.  And make bump stocks illegal as well.  THANK YOU, Rep. Swalwell, for being a true American patriot and working for the American people.   Unlike some of your @GOP colleagues.
5708 2018-02-16 16:29:16 Ban high-powered semiautomatic rifles with large capacity magazines. Mandate training, registration, & insurance for gun owners, as we do for driver’s licenses & car ownership. Limit ammunition sales. Ban bump stocks & auto-fire conversion kits. Remove guns from domestic abusers.
5709 2018-02-16 16:29:10 Thank you.  

1. What’s your definition of “assault rifle”?
2. Would we also ban police from having these weapons?
3. Would you seek to confiscate existing bump stocks?  How about 3D printers, since you can make them yourselves.
4. What if he becomes mentally ill after buying?
5710 2018-02-16 16:29:03 Bump stocks.  Not a bad guess off the top of my head.
5711 2018-02-16 16:28:56 So what President approved Bump Stocks. Hint it's not Trump. #GunControl
5712 2018-02-16 16:28:56 Stop conflating Republicans and Democrats actions towards gun control. Republicans can and do effectively block any action on background checks, semi-automatic weapons and even barrel stocks. Democrats have introduced numerous bills to take on these issues. They’re not the same
5713 2018-02-16 16:28:52 No one wants to take all guns away.  Semi automatics, high capacity magazines, billets used on the battle field and bump stocks should be banned. If you want to use those weapons go join the military. No hunter would use those weapons!

5715 2018-02-16 16:28:43 I think fish stocks are where the money is.
5716 2018-02-16 16:28:41 Value investing has historically been linked to buying statisticallly cheap securities, in the last few years some of the great value investors of our time have pivoted into investing in statistically expensive stocks.
5717 2018-02-16 16:28:23 "Bump stocks"—which adapts a semi-automatic AR-15 into a simulated automatic weapon which can shoot up to 700 rounds/minute—are only regulated in three states and a handful of cities.

I.e., almost anyone can buy one at any time with no paper trail or documentation.
5718 2018-02-16 16:28:21 If we actually want to make a difference in firearm deaths, shouldn't we understand what we are trying to accomplish first? Sure we can ban bump-stocks, but what would that accomplish aside from talking points and press releases? Banning guns isn't going to happen, what's next?
5719 2018-02-16 16:28:20 Just like a typical Republican 
@CortesSteve 
On @HLNTV @CarolCNN
Its too hard to pass gun laws,

So lets do nothing.
STFU idiot.
We need to protect our children, banning assault weapons, bump stocks DOES NOT violate 2nd Amendment. 
Ur part of the problem.

5721 2018-02-16 16:28:01 @realDonaldTrump ban assault rifles and bump stocks today
5722 2018-02-16 16:27:59 Bump stocks are a loophole already because they are an accessory, not part of the gun. I know some auto-load firearms may have similar-ish rates but they aren't the same thing. I also think the slippery slope is kind of bs, we can limit certain types and still have plenty left.
5723 2018-02-16 16:27:44 OMG, such deep knowledge and political understanding!
Must be doing same with stocks?
Take things as they are served, no?

5724 2018-02-16 16:27:25 Do it now ban assault rifles and bump stocks today
5725 2018-02-16 16:27:08 Can i buy stocks directly
5726 2018-02-16 16:27:07 None of us must let this go until AR 15s & bump stocks are illegal please RT

5729 2018-02-16 16:26:42 Every military-grade weapon should be banned, along with high-capacity ammo, cop-killer bullets, and bump stocks.  If you want to handle an AR-15, join the military.
5730 2018-02-16 16:26:29 Government bonds are losing the "allure" of safety - that is what this is reflecting.  When bonds and stocks decline together, that is telling us something has changed.  Only 3 times is past 100 years did this happen on an annualized basis - I realize the year is not over yet....

5736 2018-02-16 16:25:25 What you should find is that our background checks system is pathetically weak, and our laws have barely addressed things like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.
Europe's success with stringent laws makes the US gun death rate look like an unchecked crisis in comparison.

5740 2018-02-16 16:24:52 @MarkSimoneNY "Assault Weapons" were invented by politicians.  These are simply semi-automatic rifles with "evil features" (grips. stocks, muzzle devices) that do nothing to affect the caliber or function of the rifles.
5741 2018-02-16 16:24:51 Ban the AR 15s!!!!!!! & bump stocks!!!
5742 2018-02-16 16:24:33 We should have all come to the final conclusion that these Senators, Congresspeople and Trump are not going to do anything to strenghten our Gun Laws and Ban Assault Weapons and Bump Stocks 
Therefore...."WE MUST CHANGE OUR POLITICIANS". Pink slip them on Nov 6th 2018 !
ENOUGH!

5746 2018-02-16 16:23:45 Not only assault weapons but also multi-bullet magazines, bump stocks, concussion grenades & armor to civilians.

5748 2018-02-16 16:23:36 bigger issue is while an overwhelming majority of Americans. Gun owners or not, support sensible gun control, doing away with AR-15s,  etc, congress & the government do nothing to change any laws whatsoever. Bump stocks are still legal, it’s incredible how useless congress is
5749 2018-02-16 16:23:26 US stocks open lower than expected but markets are calm.
5750 2018-02-16 16:23:18 US stocks open lower than expected but markets are calm.
5751 2018-02-16 16:23:00 I don’t see a need for bump stocks but it’s hard when you get into bump stock areas because if not worded correctly the law will end up banning semi-auto firearms entirely. But you have to remember the 2a is there so the people & govt are equal in strength.
5752 2018-02-16 16:22:25 V - shaped rebound

Hiw do you go from a labour leader to amassing $400M in wealth without #CORRUPTION?
Hiw many Southern Africans has stocks? Like Bob Kerry said how does stock affect people life
5755 2018-02-16 16:21:59 The problem is that the real bad guys don’t care about the laws. Ban bump stocks? You can 3D print your own now and it’s pretty inexpensive. I’d love to say let’s get limit gun sales but there are 300m guns in the country. We already lost the battle of sensible gun control.
5756 2018-02-16 16:21:39 Bump stocks have been reportedly only used in 1 crime. They are a low hanging fruit that won't solve anything. Cruz could have used a stiff pair of jeans to replicate a bump stock without the need to purchase one.
5757 2018-02-16 16:20:39 @TDAmeritrade I speak for a lot of people when I say that this pricing scale update on TOS for low priced stocks is absolute garbage. For example; when a share price is .035 and your update displays it as 35.00 it is displaying the WRONG price. Please update and correct it.
5758 2018-02-16 16:19:36 @Varneyco I see you guys discussing all the big stocks. But for a lower class person would it be possible for guys to talk about the small stocks that we could invest in to get started. FYI: Love your show!!

5763 2018-02-16 16:18:41 U buying any of the fallen property stocks?
5764 2018-02-16 16:18:19 
5765 2018-02-16 16:18:02 Ban them.  Buy them back from citizens and if the police want them ok otherwise crush them.  Ban bump stocks. No devices to modify guns into war weapons should be allowed.  Stop new open carry; State pass gun safety law and Fed neutralizes-no.  Weapons in classrooms is ridiculous
5766 2018-02-16 16:17:55 Bump stocks are still legal because of political cowardice, even though they allow one to easily bypass Federal bans on automatic weapons. I'm just glad that Mr. Cruz didn't think to go get one. It could have been 170 instead of 17. Just a tool though. A killing tool.
5767 2018-02-16 16:17:44 i hope you will come with enough stocks.. don't want flash sale as usual

5769 2018-02-16 16:16:54 Wouldn’t ever be able to keep up with the growing numbers here. Not ever. Guns are a tool as well as they are used for evil purposes. Outlaw bump stocks any that could be turned into machine guns I am all for that but not all guns and it isn’t goin to happen any way.
5770 2018-02-16 16:16:45 Varney & Co. 
You guys talk about all the big stocks etc. But for the lower class people who really can't buy the big stocks in bulk. Would it be possible just to take a few minutes and suggest stocks that would be good to start investing in for the lower class people.
5771 2018-02-16 16:16:26 @SpeakerRyan it’s time to stop “stepping back” and actually “pull together” and bass a damn bill. Start somewhere. Banning bump stocks is a good start. Less talk and more action.
5772 2018-02-16 16:16:22 @SpeakerRyan BAN ASSAULT RIFLES AND BUMP-STOCKS!!!  How many more #MassShootings do we need?  How many more need to die?  NOW IS THE TIME TO TALK!!!#ParklandSchoolShooting #FloridaShooting

5774 2018-02-16 16:15:43 No such thing as "bitcoin stocks" tho
5775 2018-02-16 16:15:37 I really believe that junior gold stocks, through the use of etfs are being massively manipulated. We will see this all unravel in the next year.
5776 2018-02-16 16:15:24 I agree with a national card/cert, varying state laws only encourage private/unmonitored sales. I also believe in banning some of the heavier weapons/accessories (rapid fire shotguns, bump stocks etc). If one needs that much stopping power... they should work on their aim first.
5777 2018-02-16 16:14:40 Reduce to eliminate access to semi-auto/automatic guns, bump stocks and high capacity magazines and the options for affecting mass casualties go down dramatically whether the person is insane or not. #GunContolNow #commonsense
5778 2018-02-16 16:14:32 No average citizen needs an assault rifle!!! You can protect second amendment, while protecting against mass shootings! Background checks, no bump stocks, no silencers, no bullet proof vest piercing bullets! NO ASSAULT RIFLES!
5779 2018-02-16 16:14:10 They won't stop them short term. Lenient gun laws have put millions of weapons in a market that thousands have access that shouldn't. You have to start somewhere and maybe pulling back the really stupid ones is a start. Bump stocks, silencers, semi-automatics, really? Assinine.
5780 2018-02-16 16:14:03 I wouldn't bet those are nice, chrome line bagels or come with adjustable stocks or nice magazines but it's still nuts
5781 2018-02-16 16:13:53 Not even close to how you should honor them; how about a presidential decree to immediately outlaw bump stocks, seni-auto weapons & silencers immediately. And reinstate restrictions on mentally ill gun buyers. Actionable directives against GUNS!

5782 2018-02-16 16:13:44 Please tell me why anyone needs to have an AR 15 or bump stocks? They are people-killing machines and you don't need them for hunting animals or for "protection". It's harder to buy a handgun than an AR-15 or bump stocks.
5783 2018-02-16 16:13:38 The ATF recently said you can now shoulder braces like stocks so the brace thing is stupid and useless now anyways
5784 2018-02-16 16:13:14 Take military weapons, the rapid fire weapons and bump stocks away
5785 2018-02-16 16:13:13 The best investor education inevitably happens in education stocks. 

They teach you how to lose most of not all of your capital.
5786 2018-02-16 16:13:08 Small steps like restricting sales of semiautomatic assault guns, bump stocks, would temporarily help.  Much more preventative work and action is needed in dealing with mental health issues.  But just throwing money at it won’t fix it either.
5787 2018-02-16 16:13:01 Thanks for the question. As we all know, finding a solution to this epidemic requires more than one bill. I will support expanded background checks and tougher regulations on bump-stocks. Nobody needs to own automatic and semi-automatic weapons.
5788 2018-02-16 16:12:45 Start by ensuring that those with mental illness can’t easily purchase a gun of any kind....start by outlawing assault weapons, high count ammo magazines, bump stocks, start by stopping the flow of #NRABloodMoney. Start by doing Something #GunReformNow
5789 2018-02-16 16:12:39 How the fuck are bump stocks still legal and available for purchase!?! WTF America!!! We sadly deserve another tragic shooting if we don’t change things.

5791 2018-02-16 16:12:02 Canceling it? Are you kidding? AR15s, High Capacity mags, and bump stocks will be flying off the tables. This massacre and anti gun talk is the best thing for gun sales since they lost the Hillary and Obama boogiemen.

5794 2018-02-16 16:11:22 NOT TRUE! Just go do it, you and your other NRA puppets have been setting the narrative for too long....you know "its to soon" "we must not politicize" , you couldn't even ban bump stocks which should have been easy because they make the gun illegal. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
5795 2018-02-16 16:11:10 Semi-automatic would require an additional endorsement, as would changeable clips (as opposed to reloading in place). Bump stocks & fully auto (incl conversion kits) would be completely illegal. High round mags would be available to ppl w endorsement on premises of licensed 2/
5796 2018-02-16 16:10:44 Yea, I think ~10-15% fall is appropriate for housing. For stocks, a correction closer to ~30-40% peak-to-trough is more appropriate
5797 2018-02-16 16:10:23 It just seems like a couple of weeks ago that you were promoting $MCL.C copper potential. Not sure that the stocks you are flaunting on Twitter have done that well. An honest question is are you getting paid to promote the stocks you twit about?
5798 2018-02-16 16:10:16 Stop defending YOURSELF MARCO! You profess to be Pro-Life. Is that JUST for fetuses??? 
 Your ONLY "PRO-LIFE" option is to vote to place AR-15s & Bump Stocks on the EXISTING banned weapons list.
5799 2018-02-16 16:10:09 Maybe magazine limits, no semi-auto weapons, outlaw bump stocks. 

Yes criminals can get these guns if they want them. Basic supply and demand means if we stop producing them they become more expensive. More difficult to pay $5000.00 for a black market version.

5802 2018-02-16 16:09:32 Absolutely! No One needs a semi or fully automatic weapon.  No One needs high capacity magazines.  Ban assault weapons, automatic and semi automatic weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Our children's lives depend on it.
5803 2018-02-16 16:09:08 It's not about taking guns away.

It's about setting reasonable regulations for types of guns available to general public.

AR15 type guns are not reasonable.

Bump stocks are not reasonable.
5804 2018-02-16 16:08:24 I am a bad investment. I advise you not to buy stocks in me. My market value is on a steady downward trend
5805 2018-02-16 16:08:16 Ban all automatic weapons and anything thing that converts a gun to automatic. No manufacture of ghost guns or bump stocks.

5807 2018-02-16 16:08:01 What pisses me off is that we keep going off topic. I don't care how guns are used - lets talk about assault rifles and ONLY that. After Las Vegas - we talked about everything and then bump stocks were forgotten and they are still in the market.
5808 2018-02-16 16:07:50 Stocks rallied, end of story.
5809 2018-02-16 16:07:26 Can you read? Four months. He had four months - and his hands full with a collapsing economy, TARP, ACA. Yes gun reform wasn't #1 on his list but at least it was *ON* his list. GOP don't just fight against new regs (e.g. bump stocks) they undo old ones (e.g., silencers)

5811 2018-02-16 16:06:59 @TheView Assault rifles and bump stocks have nothing to do with 2nd member. Let's get real and stop making this political
5812 2018-02-16 16:06:09 No-It is NOT complicated-MARCO. 

AMERICA has a banned weapons list. AR-15s & Bump Stocks can be added to it with a SINGLE VOTE. 

NOT COMPLICATED AT ALL MARCO
5813 2018-02-16 16:06:07 I agree that bump stocks should be illegal. But not rifles. I purposefully don’t call them “assault” rifles, because they are for self defense, not assisting, or going on the assault with it.
5814 2018-02-16 16:06:06 Congress is against outlawing bump stocks , in big part due to NRA pressure (and election donations from NRA). 45 making easier for mentally ill to obtain guns last year was disgusting. + plans to make silencers legal, imagine if Cruz had had one  how many more would have died
5815 2018-02-16 16:05:40 Even if Washington got around to some sort of gun control, there will still be how many AR-15’s and bump stocks out there? And imagine how many more would be bought leading up to ratification. Then, picture the nightmare of confiscation...someday.

5820 2018-02-16 16:04:11 Assault weapons, machine guns , bump stocks and all other weapons suitable only for armed forces should be banned from the public.

5826 2018-02-16 16:02:47 that's great. Now ... stop cutting mental healthcare funding. We need more, not less. Raise the age to 21 to buy a rifle. Prohibit the sale of AR-15s and rapid-fire stocks. Ensure law enforcement agencies have adequate funding to enforce current gun laws.
5827 2018-02-16 16:02:39 Agree w/ bump stocks although those are just a relatively new attachment that enables something you could do with a thumb through a belt loop.

5834 2018-02-16 15:59:27 But I’m not trying to argue with you for the sake of it. I’m also not saying you don’t have some valid points. I’m also against knee jerk reactions but things have to change. History repeating itself over and over again is awful. Outlawing bump stocks could be an easy start
5835 2018-02-16 15:59:15 The agenda is to remove AR-15 or bump stocks from citizen’s hands. I find that a great agenda. No one is saying all guns should be banned. 
5836 2018-02-16 15:58:57 Start actually banning the bump stocks that everyone agreed post Vegas should be banned. Start doing things.

5842 2018-02-16 15:57:27 And then on to the next thing. No bump stocks, caps on ammunition purchases, no private gun sales, no quantity purchasing for resale, required training and insurance...just spitballing here.
5843 2018-02-16 15:57:17 Some are frantically pumping themselves & their stocks back up with more free and cheap money to lofty and unsustainable heights...Others are starting to hide the evidence and preparing to crash the thing to cover up their guilt & keep all the money again...It never stops...
5844 2018-02-16 15:57:06 STOCKS/GOP:  The GOP recognize that they need a strong economy & stock market going into November elections.  But GOP policies causing higher interest rates & a falling dollar will make it challenging.  If consumer spending drops, GOP are in big trouble.  @DNC @TheDemocrats
5845 2018-02-16 15:56:33 I await the impending rename of the Company to 'Atari Blockchain Cryptocurrency Initiative' and then for another boost in the stocks.
5846 2018-02-16 15:55:53 I can't make sense of this lust fest to own stocks at any bid especially w/ what's happening now to rates/inflation/debts/valuations. Moreover, can't make any sense of the refusal of sellers to sell other than to eager buyers or the eagerness to bid stocks higher on margin/debt
5847 2018-02-16 15:55:43 1-Open regulated mental health institutions so there aren’t atrocities like in the 50-80s
2-Make parts to change a semi-auto weapon into fully auto harder to get & incl specifics like bump stocks in the legislation
3-Set up cyber unit to find/stop violence promoting groups/sites
5848 2018-02-16 15:55:23 Seen a businessman looking fella having a coffee behind me and talking seriously about stocks and shares on the phone while typing loads of stuff on his laptop. Walked past him and he was playing Pokemon on it.
5849 2018-02-16 15:54:55 I'm fine with banning them. The fact is our gov is bloated, wasteful, and incompetent. Your party wants to give gov more power and control. Bump stocks aren't new... Why didn't Obama ban them?
5850 2018-02-16 15:53:48 it's been holding very well around 0.28....among all the pot stocks, this one may be the most promising for a rebound/reversal from this level imo..

5852 2018-02-16 15:53:35 Surprisingly, @nypost had TWO editorials today advocating gun control measures.  One to bring back bans on assault rifles, extended mags, recoil stocks and the other to emulate Israel's strict control policies.
5853 2018-02-16 15:53:30 Law change to start?
Outlaw bump stocks- not used in military. Stricter purchase requirements for Semi Autos, and no gift guns under 21like a drink.
5854 2018-02-16 15:53:24 Dig deeper here as to the why. There was a sound policy and constitutional argument to ban civilian sale of machine guns, that basis does not exist with your arbitrary magazine size argument. 

Re: bump stocks, agreed, close simulation to automatic capacity should be banned.
5855 2018-02-16 15:53:13 @coinbase cryptoshitcoins (ie all crypto) are securities. Why the fuck would you let people buy then with debit/credit cards? No brokerage in the world lets anybody buy stocks or bonds with VISA/MC. Client bank transfer money in, make purchases, then transfer out after they sell.

5859 2018-02-16 15:52:16 @StMartinBr yea... this thing feels like DCTH lol. One of the worst stocks I’ve ever bought into. Was complete trash. Learned from it
5860 2018-02-16 15:52:09 Remember, the strategy of the NRA and its legislative comrades will be to offer thoughts and prayers while delaying and obfuscating until pro-gun control momentum peters out. It works. Heard anything about bump stocks recently? Pressure must be maintained through election day.
5861 2018-02-16 15:51:56 @SusanPage: It's so perplexing to Americans that Congress can't seem to do *anything* on gun control. Even seemingly minor things like banning bump stocks.
5862 2018-02-16 15:51:36 Chinese also not able to buy any US stocks, even Alibaba...
5863 2018-02-16 15:51:36 Tell that to the 50 people killed and 400 injured by the legal use of bump stocks in Vegas.
5864 2018-02-16 15:51:21 2/2 the time for these people because they dont want to lose their precious ARs, their bump stocks, and their high capacity magazines.  The hell with the innocents that are being slaughtered left and right as long as you can have your assault rifle.
5865 2018-02-16 15:51:19 Yes.  And, mandate background checks. And, 72 hr waiting period.  And, ban bump stocks. And, encourage trigger recognition devices.
5866 2018-02-16 15:51:15 It's called loopholes lots of them called bump stocks for example
5867 2018-02-16 15:51:10 All of your solutions are after the fact. Start by repealing the law you helped pass last year allowing the mentally ill to buy guns. Outlaw bump stocks and trigger cranks. Liars and cowards are not leaders. #CharacterMatters
5868 2018-02-16 15:51:09 Madaz, I work at an HFT house and I have been watching your blog and matching up when you say you short these crap stocks and seeing if the shares are available because we trade them with size daily.shares are not there based on your EOD share volume. STOP HURTING PEOPLE
5869 2018-02-16 15:50:58 @Morning_Joe where is Earner with his chart on gun stocks after each tragedy. They are making millions
5870 2018-02-16 15:50:55 We’ve got to take action. We’ve got to try. Outlaw bump stocks. Improve background checks. Close gunshow and other loopholes. 75% of people want these changes
5871 2018-02-16 15:50:55 I won’t argue with the sentiment but it seems completely unrealistic when we can’t even agree to ban assault weapons or bump stocks. Or to close loopholes in the background check laws.
5872 2018-02-16 15:50:34 don’t watch the stocks lol

5877 2018-02-16 15:49:12 4) I’m on the record supporting outlaw of bump stocks. But extended mags for life. Give me extended magazines or give me death. Jk lol I live in anti-Constitutional California and can’t own extended mags anyway
5878 2018-02-16 15:49:01 I am clearly in support of congress to establish a law that prohibits greater than 9 rounds in a magazine. Been saying this from the beginning. That’s clearly defined. I’d love Bump stocks to be outlawed. It’s a go-around.
5879 2018-02-16 15:48:51 Can modify a rifle with something called a bump stock, an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire bullets almost as fast as a fully automatic rifle. Bump stocks are legal, fairly cheap and easy to obtain.
5880 2018-02-16 15:48:11 True American hero. He’s 1000% right. The days of “its too soon to talk about it must end today”! GOP couldn’t even manage to ban bump stocks after vegas. Those who cash the NRA checks are complicit.

5882 2018-02-16 15:47:20 Now I'm no fancy stock broker, but if you really want to profit off kids dying, buy those stocks between school shootings and sell high! Someone probably already has an algorithm to do it all automatically.
5883 2018-02-16 15:46:53 Yes it does!!! It has to do with easy access to a type of gun, large clips or bump stocks, etc that are capable of rapidly shooting large numbers of bullets causing mass casualties. They are weapons of war and should not be on our streets.
5884 2018-02-16 15:46:44 Tomorrow?!?! Are you freakin’ serious?!?! The NRA puppets in Congress won’t even ban bump stocks. We need to be talking about baby steps - incremental changes that will build up over time. (BTW, the police will still have guns even after your ban.)

5890 2018-02-16 15:45:57 Yes and ban bump stocks. Take some action, please.
5891 2018-02-16 15:45:45 Respect. I'm a strongly pro-2A person who is open to banning bump stocks, for example. It just escalates so quickly that it becomes tribal shouting on both sides.
5892 2018-02-16 15:45:42 GUNS, Senator. Why spend $300MM on school safety if we are not addressing the root causes.  No assault rifles, bump stocks, silencers, and no guns for mentally disturbed people (aka you repealed the Obama legislation on this). Stop deflecting!
5893 2018-02-16 15:44:53 I agree the interview was awful, but @RichLowry is defending the indefensible.  The status quo is indefensible.  Legal bump stocks are indefensible.  More guns make us safer is indefensible.  Stop blaming and please offer solutions.  I want a safer place to raise a family.

5897 2018-02-16 15:43:42 The "gun lobby" didn't create bump stocks or similar devices, the first bump fire weapon was most likely an AR in a belt loop, and they are still legally semi-automatic.
5898 2018-02-16 15:43:40 If you think that Universal Background checks, mandatory waiting periods, and a ban on high capacity magazines and bump stocks (which should already be illegal) is an unreasonable request, you need to understand how radical, on a global scale, your position is.

5915 2018-02-16 15:40:47 I used to respect Sen. Graham. Now he makes statement that he will not vote to ban the AR-15, but will vote to ban bump stocks. He is showing his loyalty to the NRA not his constituents. Why in the world does any non-law enforcement person need such a powerful killing machine.
5916 2018-02-16 15:40:27 Sandy Hook showed that controlling the "who" can only go so far.  "Bump stocks" show that the what is of limited help.  What do you think about banning coverage and commentary of the shootings?
5917 2018-02-16 15:40:22 Let’s be specific: assault style rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and suppressors should be outlawed. Gun ownership should be well qualified and regulated. Simple.

5946 2018-02-16 15:34:54 Assault weapons should not be in the hands of civilians. Nationwide mandatory background checks & waiting periods. Gun safety training & licensing. A national gun registry. Outlaw silencers, bump stocks & other modification gear.  None of these impinge on your right to bare arms.
5947 2018-02-16 15:34:29 Oui, ça a été un bide total ce jeu (à raison) et il y a des stocks énormes qui restent.
5948 2018-02-16 15:34:24 I never said I was against any regulation, I just think the regulation in MA is not right. Banning bump stocks, waiving HIPPA rights for mental health screening, and closing gun show loopholes are all good. Having a police chief be the end all be all for approving licenses isnt
5949 2018-02-16 15:33:45 Simply not true, its proven to work in other countries. Re bump stocks, why on earth would anyone need a fully automatic gun?!
5950 2018-02-16 15:33:33 I see you are Comstocking again today!  We care about kids getting shot and dying in school hallways. Can you hear their screams as they lay dying?

5951 2018-02-16 15:33:22 @AskRobinhood which I did but neither of us have received our stocks or any other communication.
5952 2018-02-16 15:33:20 Again I agree.. But let me ask you this.. Do you really think stocks can continue their current bull market while the yen carry trade unwinds? FX much bigger than bond market..
5953 2018-02-16 15:33:17 If it's too early to discuss the Florida school shooting can we discuss the Las Vegas shooting? It's been four months. Are bump stocks illegal yet?
5954 2018-02-16 15:33:14 Oh, has there been legislative change as a result? Even bump stocks haven't been banned natively after the worst mass shooting on recent record.

5956 2018-02-16 15:32:59 NRA & GOP are complicit in these death. What happened to bump stocks? Nothing. If you want sensible gun control, u can’t vote Republican.
5957 2018-02-16 15:32:56 they dnt even offer daytrade margin for ES...thay sucks for futures it's only good u can use stocks as collateral
5958 2018-02-16 15:32:39 Another issue is once we create regulation much like bump stocks ppl will make stuff that fringes on legality... which the manufacturing is quicker than the legislation.
5959 2018-02-16 15:32:17 $46.36   22 sale   buy only1 order    can see how scatps intel stocks $intc similar to $wfc stocks.ha ha
5960 2018-02-16 15:31:26 Assault weapons ban, background checks, limit to high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks. Hows that?
5961 2018-02-16 15:31:15 No regulation will stop someone intent on harming others. As for bump stocks, the ignorance about them is staggering. Are you aware that one can achieve the same effect by hooking their finger thru their belt loop when firing ANY gun other than a revolver or bolt action?
5962 2018-02-16 15:31:08 I have no problem with banning bump stocks. However, they have only been used in one shooting incident in all of American history.
5963 2018-02-16 15:31:08 Mass shooting happens.  Gun stocks go up.  Say teachers should carry guns.  More guns=more profits for gun companies. Hype fear that Dems are coming to take your guns=more gun sales=more profits. It's a win win for gun companies. #GunReformNow #Parkland #FloridaShooting
5964 2018-02-16 15:31:07 Huh.. $Arna Directors Don't rotate off Board every 10 years, Nova there since 2004 and Woods since 2007 Whoa.. So much instability, 4 changes in 20months

5966 2018-02-16 15:30:47 It is good to see CNBC investigating stock market manipulations, people who pump stocks, people who profit off of touts, people lying to the public....hmmm,
5967 2018-02-16 15:30:41 yes. most people know that. and with bump stocks legal there's not much of a difference
5968 2018-02-16 15:30:41 Bad morning ! Stocks not sticks sorry
5969 2018-02-16 15:30:37 It is good to see CNBC investigating stock market manipulations, people who pump stocks, people who profit off of touts, people lying to the public....hmmm,
5970 2018-02-16 15:30:31 An assault weapon isnt... really a thing. And bump stocks + mag size limitations are like airport security- mostly theatre. So that's pretty much my point in a nutshell.
5971 2018-02-16 15:30:30 It is good to see CNBC investigating stock market manipulations, people who pump stocks, people who profit off of touts, people lying to the public....hmmm,
5972 2018-02-16 15:30:22 It is good to see CNBC investigating stock market manipulations, people who pump stocks, people who profit off of touts, people lying to the public....hmmm,
5973 2018-02-16 15:29:58 But what are you going to do when you return to Washington? Join you in what? What is the plan???? Let me tell you it is:
1. Banning assault rifles
2. Background Checks
3. No silencers, stop bump stocks
4. Mental Health support (for victims too)
DO SOMETHING!
5974 2018-02-16 15:29:53 So let's not ban guns then. Let's just support background checks, keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, ban bump stocks, and put a few more safety measures in place. None of this is controversial.
5975 2018-02-16 15:29:50 It is good to see CNBC investigating stock market manipulations, people who pump stocks, people who profit off of touts, people lying to the public....hmmm,
5976 2018-02-16 15:29:29 Horrible earnings report from $KHC this morning #stocks #stockmarkets #SP500 #DowJones #investing
5977 2018-02-16 15:29:24 Yes.  Assault weapons, bump stocks should  be banned.   Limit size of magazines.  Stricter gun laws and stop taking blood money from the nra.  Stop b ing cowards and start working for the american people.
5978 2018-02-16 15:29:22 I said that it was a difficult circumstance. My point was how quickly he was able to dump that amount of ammo into his targets. Also, if you’re using a rubber band or belt loop to bump fire, good luck aiming. I’ve used both the stocks and the other ways, they don’t really work
5979 2018-02-16 15:29:21 Do you realize that the AR has the same capabilities as most hunting rifles?  You can just add things like collapsible stocks and high capacity mags. It shoots the same round as a .22
5980 2018-02-16 15:28:58 More shorting by NITE now at 6
5981 2018-02-16 15:28:55 This is a bit contrary to what u discussed in ur tweet during the day that u r getting the feel of price action and stocks do react from ur narrow bands.
5982 2018-02-16 15:28:54 Now retirement accounts have recovered to 1/09/2018 level, which a huge increase with America’s President in charge.  Crickets from MSM on recovery of stocks.
5983 2018-02-16 15:28:34 not necessarily, I invest mainly through my local bank. Most banks will allow you to trade stocks for either a very small quarterly fee and/or transaction fee. I'd start with going to the bank you have your savings at maybe they'll have an offer seeing as you're a customer
5984 2018-02-16 15:28:30 Here's a thought... When the second amendment was written I guarantee our Founding Father's never imagined that schools would be killing fields and/or they never imagined bump-stocks or easy access of automated weapons would be so prolific!
5985 2018-02-16 15:28:22 Should be a flag on multiple high capacity magazine purchases and ammo purchases
as well. Along with bump stocks, those flags might have caught the Vegas shooter,
Pulse and San Bernadino.....
5986 2018-02-16 15:28:06 Big difference, large portion of main-street was invested in internet stocks, right now, only a portion of main-street has heard of #Bitcoin. Once they’re in, then let’s talk. Currently too hard to enter for main-street.
5987 2018-02-16 15:28:00 Machine guns are designed to fire faster and more efficiently than a semi-auto rifle with a bump stock.  Words should have clear definitions.   And if you want to protest no action from Congress about bump stocks, let me join you.
5988 2018-02-16 15:27:57 Don't worry haha ! It's better to get in contact with Aranda to know when they get their stocks back and/or if you can custom order them tho, they sell pretty quick !
Enjoy your blankets <3
5989 2018-02-16 15:27:42 Yes. At least: Ban AR-15s and bump stocks. Ban folks with domestic violence convictions from obtaining firearms. Low-hanging fruit.
5990 2018-02-16 15:27:26 An AR15 buyback program and complete ban of bump stocks is the starting point.
5991 2018-02-16 15:27:17 Wall Street Opens Lower as Financial, Tech Stocks Weigh
5992 2018-02-16 15:27:02 And to think, all republicans had to do was say they were looking into bump stocks to get away without any blame after Vegas. What did all that “looking into” do? Nothing. Just a line for the media to pick up and to dupe Americans into thinking there would be action.
5993 2018-02-16 15:26:46 Go back and try to look at facts. Republicans have blocked all attempts to ban semi-automatics, bump stocks or to expand background checks and eliminate gun show loopholes. They are in the pocket of the NRA.
5994 2018-02-16 15:26:24 Hour into the day, stocks very slightly up, capping a good week. Still in sideways range, but climbing. TREND STILL DOWN on the indicators, FULL HEDGES STILL ON. Staying cautious until trend shifts and enjoying the ride.
5995 2018-02-16 15:26:17 You and Boyce type House negroes created the conditions for young brothas like Migos to grow up in. Then try to put on suits and ties and talk about trading stocks with massa.
5996 2018-02-16 15:26:15 Are you still thinking with the Monday holiday MJ stocks will be higher Tuesday?
5997 2018-02-16 15:25:59 @realDonaldTrump Only you can do it.  Support a real ban on assault rifles and bump stocks. Be a hero. Show the NRA you cannot be bought.
5998 2018-02-16 15:25:47 Here are some things that sensible Gun Control Laws.
- Intense Background checks
- Assault rifles stored at Gun Clubs Only, age requirements to shoot.
- No Bump Stocks
- Mandatory Training
- Mandatory Safes
- If children obtain guns from parents, parents charged same as Killers.
5999 2018-02-16 15:25:45 Taking today off. Coffee stocks are about to rise.
6000 2018-02-16 15:25:44 Yes! And bump stocks. That was a no brainier, and yet instead we have a bill that basically says your concealed carry is good no matter what state you're in? So much for "states rights." What else would we expect from a corrupt GOP? We the People expect so much more!
6001 2018-02-16 15:25:43 2012 obama administration approved the sell of bump stocks.
What say you now?
6002 2018-02-16 15:25:27 There's a lot of mo’ fucking weed stocks out there, we got hemp, grnh,, phot. Ya but which one is legit, who knows man let's just get high

6004 2018-02-16 15:25:16 There's no buying.
6005 2018-02-16 15:25:01 Again, i do not follow SL on daily closing basis. Being higher time frame trader, i always prefer SL on weekly closing basis, and often 3-4% below said bands. And most of my bands reflects that sort of price action. Stocks often go marginally below bands on intraday basis.
6006 2018-02-16 15:25:01 $UPS It's just the early sessions. We all know the value of this now. Intraday doesn't matter. At this price it's just Buy & Hold. $RIOT This is on it's way to 0. Retail be careful here. #stocks #trading #investing

6009 2018-02-16 15:24:17 Yes, I think bump stocks are a useless tool. But have only been used in a crime one time in the history of the USA
6010 2018-02-16 15:23:54 We can limiting “killing capacity” without “taking away guns.”  Enforce background checks and gun surrender (violent criminals and domestic abusers,) limit magazine capacity, tax ammunition, ban bump stocks. Also don’t vote for people who take NRA $$
6011 2018-02-16 15:23:51 $WEBB 0.01 could be a b/o over 0.01 area ...
6012 2018-02-16 15:23:31 One weird thing about the recent market sell-off: American indexes are now off ~2% over the past month, but European indexes are down ~6% and Japanese stocks are down 10%. Was it really something US-oriented that triggered it?
6013 2018-02-16 15:23:16 The three-month correlation between S&P 500 sectors jumped Monday to 73%, nearly double last year’s average of 37%. Some investors fear stocks' intertwined rally could lead to more turbulence ahead.
6014 2018-02-16 15:23:13 The day after that horrible Las Vegas shooting and the news came out about that maniac using bump stocks, it should have been an instant slam dunk.  OUTLAW.  BOOM.  DONE.  But the NRA / GOP blocked it.  WTF????
6015 2018-02-16 15:23:12 I literally called my reps and made them listen to me recount the tale of our conversation and yell-cried at them about bump stocks and automatic weapons for a little bit.
6016 2018-02-16 15:23:12 Guess he’s found the wrong advisor

6018 2018-02-16 15:23:05 Yes, and limit magazine sizes & eliminate bump-stocks, make background checks more detailed and how  about making gun owners get a license similar to a driver's license
6019 2018-02-16 15:23:02 Wrong as usual.  Democrats blocked the ban on bump stocks.
6020 2018-02-16 15:22:46 Don’t know, but you and I have both agreed in previous debates about bump stocks, I have not said a word about taking guns. Also I am against violent video games. Ask my son when he brought one home.
6021 2018-02-16 15:22:25  that's more like it. I'm guessing Bridgewater may be shorting specific individual stocks, too, instead of an index fund.
6022 2018-02-16 15:21:53 So a biotech company developing a medicine and hoping that A) the company manages to go through all steps B) the product ends up being better than the competitor C) the company manages to profit from the development. This is why penny stocks are risky
6023 2018-02-16 15:21:46 You can buy antique automatic weapons manufacturered pre-1986 Iirc. And bump stocks are easily available. Plus, rifles like AR-15 are more deadly than handguns for a variety of reasons beyond potentially being modded to be automatic
6024 2018-02-16 15:21:41 LMAO at Chris Wallace, just as ignorant as his Dad...crying about the fact that Trump has done nothing about ‘Bump Stocks’...news flash, as I type this, there are 8 things within reach of me that I can use to mimic a bump stock...so, what can he do to stop bad people? More laws?

6030 2018-02-16 15:20:45 And Trump and GOP monumentally failed to ban bump stocks after Vegas due to the NRA’s zero tolerance for ANY gun regulations.
6031 2018-02-16 15:20:43 Yes.  Ban all assault weapons, bump stocks, armor piercing ammunition, private non background check sales of weapons, gun parts & modification accessories.  Do not force interstate acceptance of concealed carry weapons.
6032 2018-02-16 15:20:24 thinking and actions of people that live right now in the same world you do, worrying about which stocks to buy or whether or not a stranger

6034 2018-02-16 15:20:11 The few existing gun laws are clearly not enough. Background checks should be required at gun shows. We could ban bump stocks. There’s no reason a student with mental health issues, who was reported to the FBI, who was expelled from school should be able to LEGALLY buy a gun.
6035 2018-02-16 15:20:03 $RYN ready for new highs? Looks like next target level $39.10 ... Good base _-> #breakout #markets  #stocks #lumber #finance
6036 2018-02-16 15:19:30 Annual registration. Age limits and regular proficiency tests. Manufacturing caps. Banning bump stocks. Better and more comprehensive background checks. Federal legislation that helps address disparities in ease of access across state lines.
6037 2018-02-16 15:19:07 I may own guns and fight for my right to have them but I'm not crazy. If I thought it was best for the country and the public in general I would gladly make changes. My opinion, bump stocks have to go. There's certain levels of Weaponry that should not be allowed to the public.
6038 2018-02-16 15:18:42 4/11 @floridarocket Horrific tragedies like Parkland couldn’t happen if we banned semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks and high capacity clips.  A shooter just can't do as much damage with a 22 rifle as he can with an AR-15.
6039 2018-02-16 15:18:37 Bump stocks are not illegal They allow an AR to fire WAY more than 100/min
Avg shooter w speed of about 2 shots/sec, emptying a mag in 15 sec Reload takes maybe 4 sec,  so it’s 19 sec to empty a mag and recharge. So effective rate is about 90 RPM not counting time it takes to aim
6040 2018-02-16 15:18:05 Probably a mix of both. Many Indian Entrepreneurs want to run businesses, but *without* any real skin in the game. Thus zero promoters funds and when things go south, they walk away.
Many want to make a quick buck also with Other People's Money. Eg Speculative lending or Stocks
6041 2018-02-16 15:17:47 Meant 'out law' bump stocks..  not allow..
6042 2018-02-16 15:17:38 Are you saying they will stop buying the dips in these big stocks?
6043 2018-02-16 15:17:22 Schiavoni is on the record saying he wants to at least expand background checks and ban bump stocks. Cordray in on the record about nothing and there is second hand information from @ajdagres saying he supports no new legislation.

6050 2018-02-16 15:16:33 That how the hell a 18 year old kid had access to buy a AR15? Why would anybody need to have access to a AR15 and bump stocks?
6051 2018-02-16 15:16:30 How about someone shoots Paul Ryan with a legally bought gun? Someone not brown. Bet you assault rifles, bump stocks and large clips get banned the next day.
6052 2018-02-16 15:16:00 PARTIAL SOLUTION: NATIONWIDE SCHOOL WALK OUT on MARCH 1st-refuse to  return until assault weapons & bump stocks are banned, until universal background checks are mandatory & people that should not have access to weapons R denied. #EnoughIsEnough We must break cycle of inaction.
6053 2018-02-16 15:15:45 SO damn tired of hearing these talking heads discuss the need to ban " bump stocks" components of guns...guns period. HEY MORONS LISTEN:
Its NOT the guns per se,  its people not having a MEANINGFUL life...ITS PEOPLE AND SOCIETY that needs direction. Change t.v. content to start..

6055 2018-02-16 15:15:26 yup, not safe right now, algos looking at pe/s to ten year yields, buying stocks below the yield, ignoring stocks above, ie yielding less including divs

You're doing the crypto community  an  invaluable service.  
Thank you sir!
6057 2018-02-16 15:15:01 More guns to answer gun violence is ridiculous. And refusing to address gun violence at SOME LEVEL INCLUDING THE OUTLAWING OF BUMP STOCKS OR SEMI AUTOS is foolish! How can you not want some laws or some protection? You want to militarize school security forces?

6060 2018-02-16 15:14:12 "ITS A SEMI AUTO RIFLE LIBCUCKS"

didn't we find out about bump stocks / how to fire a semi auto like full auto like 4 shootings ago?
6061 2018-02-16 15:14:08 in other areas of life. Longer wait times, age restrictions, & mandatory classes are not unreasonable nor do they violate the 2nd. Neither does banning bump stocks. But bth sides 2 busy arguing xtreme positions so nothing gets done.

6068 2018-02-16 15:12:31 The one and  only purpose of the weapon used is to kill mass numbers of people.  These semi automatic weapons and bump stocks have no place in the hands of civilians.  It will never stop.  The NRA will fight it tooth and nail.
6069 2018-02-16 15:12:21 The USD will be weak regardless of the yen. However, a strong yen would not bode well for stocks  despite a weak USD. I think the yen will have to be even weaker than an already weak USD.
6070 2018-02-16 15:12:21 The NRA wouldn’t even let you ban bump stocks after The Vegas massacre. Maybe you can explain to the families why you signed a bill making it easier for mentally ill to buy guns? Or give them more hot air by saying “we’re going to be looking into lots of things”.
6071 2018-02-16 15:12:20 You sound very sensible.  We need that.  I'm not advocating rounding up all guns.  I AM advocating outlawing bump stocks and assault weapons and coming up with a system that better protects the public.  There is no perfect answer.  But there are improvements we can make

6077 2018-02-16 15:11:26 Why do you need semi auto weapons, why do you need silencers, & what's happend with the ban on bump stocks. It's insane having these guns in public hands, a gun has one purpose that's to kill nothing else.

6079 2018-02-16 15:11:18 So Chris Wallace just lied on TV saying bump stocks make the gun fire faster! THIS IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE!
6080 2018-02-16 15:11:09 Not just assault rifles. 
The gun industry finds a way around gun bans. The terrorist organization @NRA count on loop holes.

Ban high caliber rounds.
Ban high cap mags.
Ban bump stocks.
Enforce mandatory age of 21.
Enforce mandatory training.
Enforce mental health screening.
6081 2018-02-16 15:10:22 #Guncontrol not needed. Solution: Fund metal detectors in all public and private colleges/schools, train law enforcement to use and man them. Outlaw bump stocks. Outlaw/flag those with real mental issues from purchasing guns/ammunition. Replace evil hearts with Godly hearts.

6085 2018-02-16 15:09:45 Diamond and Silk I think you two are great, however we are talking about mass shooting at this point, and we need to stay focused on that.  I love my rights including my 2nd amendment rights, we need to ban ar15's and bump stocks.  And raise age that a gun can be purchased.
6086 2018-02-16 15:09:45 It isn't evil its Americans with ASSUALT RIFLES_BUMP STOCKS!!
6087 2018-02-16 15:09:40 No assault rifles to citizens of any age, no guns or rifles to anyone under 21, no fly list No weapons, mentally unbalanced No weapons, no bump stocks, complete background check before any purchase of a weapon, all military must report issues with their personnel.
6088 2018-02-16 15:09:16 AR-15 is semi auto.... add a bump stock, it's effectively auto. Where are you learning about firearms from? You've now been wrong twice. "No such thing as an assault rifle" wrong. "no one uses bump stocks outside demos" wrong again. Reply and give me a third one

6090 2018-02-16 15:08:32 Dipshit, this guy passed a background check and wouldn't have cared about an "assault weapons" ban. Bumpfire stocks weren't even used here.

Why not say that the first  "action NOW"  and the first "immediate step" to do is ban AR-15s, bump stocks and large capacity clips?
6096 2018-02-16 15:07:53 The Wall Street speculators pay no tax on their share of a yearly turnover of over $5 quadrillion (5,000 trillion dollars) in stocks, bonds and derivatives. A 1% tax on this turnover, equally divided between the federal and state governments, largely solves the budget deficit.

6102 2018-02-16 15:06:56 3% of Americans own 1/2 the guns. Yet Super majorities believe in background checks, assault weapon bans and prohibiting bump stocks. 80-90% of us believe in some regulation.  Madness.  Carnage. Pictures of dead teens.  Enough! Stop the NRA. #ParklandShooting #GunControlNow
6103 2018-02-16 15:06:55 @redsteeze You started with “Republicans said "Okay lets talk about bump stocks.." and then Democrats said [we want more.]”   
Then you say “If a clean bill to ban bump stocks came to the floor today, it would pass tomorrow”. Which party controls which bills get to the floor?

6106 2018-02-16 15:06:12 I think all of those can be done, except taking away people’s already-owned rifles. 

California took away people’s large capacity mags, so I suppose bump stocks could be taken away as well. Or at least try.

6115 2018-02-16 15:04:22 After Las Vegas, all agreed INCLUDING THE NRA that bump stocks on rifles should be outlawed. Congress could not get it done because lawmakers kept tacking on their favorite provisions to the bill and ultimately it failed. Has nothing to do with Potus.
6116 2018-02-16 15:04:16 good day to be SELLING stocks.  $SPY $QQQ
6117 2018-02-16 15:03:29 Yes. Banning assault weapons long overdo & ban the ammo clips and bump stocks or other conversion devices. There is no defense that adequately justifies any automatic weapons that kil people, rapidly and in large numbers. Weapons of war  are not for protection but for murder.

6120 2018-02-16 15:03:05 Kids see and live the , To Kill a Mockingbird story everyday. An innocent black man is killed. Has very little to do w banning military assault rifles. Banning bump stocks,  background checks. No guns to the mentally ill. National registry.

6125 2018-02-16 15:02:14 @RepAdamSchiff 1) Assault rifles and bump stocks need banned. It's not just the rifles that pose the problem. Shell re-loaders are cheap as is gunpowder and shells. A person can use casings over and over again at virtually no expense. Thermite can also be bought at sporting goods
6126 2018-02-16 15:02:07 You mean when Obama authorized the sale of bump stocks?

6128 2018-02-16 15:01:35 Because those 3% who own 50% of America’s guns will rise up like David Koresh or Cliven Bundy? And FOX will be egging them on! You are disgusting. And we can’t even get universal background checks and rid us of bump stocks.
6129 2018-02-16 15:01:32 It's not a group of legislators, it's the American People. TRY to do something. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks. People do not need a *weapon of war* in their houses.  Americans are tired of losing their children because our "government" shows to be bunch of pussies.
6130 2018-02-16 15:01:19 The Wall Street speculators pay no tax on their share of a yearly turnover of over $5 quadrillion (5,000 trillion dollars) in stocks, bonds and derivatives. A 1% tax on this turnover, equally divided between the federal and state governments, largely solves the budget deficit.
6131 2018-02-16 15:00:58 Enhanced background checks need to be law for gun purchases! Assault weapons, bump stocks etc should be outlawed but also better enforcement of all gun laws and serious attention to mental health issues. America is the only country with this kind of peacetime carnage.
6132 2018-02-16 15:00:27 Ban semi automatic guns and bump stocks for one. No reciprocity for conceal and carry. No conceal and carry.

6136 2018-02-16 14:59:27 They didn't even bother banning the bump stocks that the NRA was like "please, go ahead." They don't care.  I guess it got in the way of tax breaks for rich people.
6137 2018-02-16 14:59:21 What about the Nice lorry attack which killed and injured more people than the vegas shooter with his semi autos fitted with evil bump stocks?

6139 2018-02-16 14:59:08 No, it isn't.  After the Vegas shooting, the GOP proposed a ban on bump-stocks but the Dems wouldn't vote for it unless it had other measures attached.  This was a no-brainer but nothing happened.
6140 2018-02-16 14:59:04 No mention of gun reform why? Because your expecting another $40-50 million from the NRA on your next election run correct? Bump stocks and assault weapons need to be banned.
6141 2018-02-16 14:59:01 @COFInvesting You should be ashamed of your trading platform.  I know you sold to @etrade so you don't care, but the price of stocks real time are WIDLY inaccurate - you should be sued

6146 2018-02-16 14:58:11 In order to win a case against a Gun MFG for wrongful death you have to prove that their product was misused due to their negligence, bump stocks fall into this category, except we can''t sue gun mfg for wrongful death.

6149 2018-02-16 14:57:56 You can secure American’s future by returning the $100,000 the NRA gave you and supporting:
14 day waiting periods
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Licenses for all arms
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban

#GunReformNow
6150 2018-02-16 14:57:48 You're right, it's not a fully automatic weapon unless modified as so. And I appreciate the work done to limit bump stocks, etc. But it's still a combat weapon designed to be lighter and more efficient than the M14 as a response to the creation of the Ak-47...
6151 2018-02-16 14:57:46 “Berkshire boosted its holding of Apple to $28B at year-end. That makes Apple its largest equity holding by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.” Value as an *analytical style* (not a statistical factor) can be about buying stocks with under appreciated quality.
6152 2018-02-16 14:57:44 The NRA needs to stop making this a 2nd Amendment issue when its not.  AR-15s bum stocks should be banned.  It's sad that mental illness has so much stigma, and we took away school psychologists, don't have proper healthcare, but it's okay to buy weapons for killing people.

6161 2018-02-16 14:56:07 That would mean he doesn't want to close loopholes, do anything about gun shows, or bump stocks. Is it true? I honestly don't know. But he does have an A rating from the NRA and won't come out with policy.

6164 2018-02-16 14:55:35 You know the area well. So do I. I lived in Parkland and Coral Springs for much of the 90s. If AR15s weren't available far fewer kids would have died. If the mentally Ill couldn't by guns, none would have died. I heard this morning that congress won't even vote to ban bump stocks
6165 2018-02-16 14:55:07 This is a straw man statement. No one wants jack booted thugs to take away your guns. We are trying to stop the sale of AR-15’s, bump stocks, have stricter background checks and more money for mental health is schools and in our communities.
6166 2018-02-16 14:55:01 My point was bump stocks (stupid toys) shouldn't be banned. Even if they did actually have any effect beyond missing barns. 
6167 2018-02-16 14:54:50 It's temporary lip service, like bump stocks (still legal)
6168 2018-02-16 14:54:32 stop saying gun control  it's ar 15 and bump stocks
6169 2018-02-16 14:54:28 PARTIAL SOLUTION: NATIONWIDE SCHOOL WALK OUT on MARCH 1st-refuse to return until assault weapons & bump stocks are banned, until universal background checks are mandatory, and people that should not have access to weapons R denied. #EnoughIsEnough We must break cycle of inaction.

6172 2018-02-16 14:53:54 Blah blah blah blah blah,  in his mind some point could be next century.  Couldn't even ban bump stocks.
6173 2018-02-16 14:53:41 Everyone is into stocks now a days
6174 2018-02-16 14:53:38 First those guns break down smaller with stocks off. Second if he had let’s say two days on a busy weekend, who the hell is going to count how any times one man went to his car. Suitcases and people constantly moving to and from rooms. Just STOP.
6175 2018-02-16 14:53:12 Bump stocks illegal in SC. Full auto is illegal. Internet warned. Parents knew from suspension. FBI was investigating.
6176 2018-02-16 14:53:12 Okay so then re-institute the assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to lapse in 2004? Preventing anyone with a domestic abuse charge or conviction from buying a weapon? Ban bump stocks and large capacity magazines? I'm here for absolutely all of those things.
6177 2018-02-16 14:53:11 Get it out and gone and we are on to a dollar !!
6178 2018-02-16 14:53:08 Want to ban all the "scary looking" guns? OK but that's a politics bill not actual useful policy.  I'll be fine, I prefer my classy wood stocks instead of the tactical look.

I'd love engagement on this, but problems need to be honestly assessed.
6179 2018-02-16 14:52:57 You are not working with Congress in any  way you are only DEMANDING they do things YOUR way if they want you to sign it your way is not always the best way. Let’s get together and pass legislation that benefits all AMERICANS DO SOMETHING WITH PEOPLE ABLE TO PURCHASE BUMP STOCKS,

6185 2018-02-16 14:51:49 We must ban bump stocks and automatic weapons.

Gun stocks can rise 400%+ after these mass shootings.

6192 2018-02-16 14:50:43 How stupid can one person be well wrap it up in a nice little package and sessions will pop up out of it. Saying it is gang-related is a ploy to take away the real reason for this massacre. Bump stocks AR-15. It's not going to work sessions
6193 2018-02-16 14:50:27 So not technically a “spray”, but a much faster reset of the trigger. Auto fire is much much faster. Still, bump stocks can be very fast.

6197 2018-02-16 14:49:52 Here’s another idea Walmart makes close to 2 billion dollars from ebt and food stamp purchases, how about we stop them from selling weapons as they are cashing in our taxes dollars for lower income American to buy gun stocks to sell in Walmart

But the first step needs to leadership declining pay-offs from NRA & others & work for their constituents of whom over 85% support #GunReform: background checks (no loopholes), no bump stocks. 21yrs to get handgun, 18 for assault rifle? Really? Limits on magazines. Yes. TY!
6200 2018-02-16 14:49:24 Essentially yes. With semi-auto triggers, you have to pull, release for each fire. Bump stocks allow the gun to bump back and reset trigger without moving trigger finger.
6201 2018-02-16 14:49:08 Hello Jon,
Thank you for your feedback, really appreciated.
However, we should have additional stocks available in the upcoming days !
I don't have any precise ETA yet though, we will probably let you guys know through Twitter as soon as we can !
6202 2018-02-16 14:48:57 You’re HORRIBLE & the only way to redeem yourself is to BAN assault weapons, large magazines, and bump stocks.  Do you have the stones to stand up to the NRA??
6203 2018-02-16 14:48:57 $CBS Surprised the stocks not moving much higher in here.. sb a $65 stock in this tape.. CBS is asset rich and should trade at a premium..
6204 2018-02-16 14:48:53 Well... in some stocks I bought yesterday or today I use the 5 min chart to monitor my stop & danger zone... kept me safe so far, getting out of positions as soon as they revisit my avg cost
6205 2018-02-16 14:48:44 Correction. T-bills are never listed in the stocks exchange. Only bonds are. T-bills are held in CDS accounts at Central Bank. Also, T-bills mature after a maximum of one year. There is no way there is unredeemed T-bill that was issued in the 90s.
6206 2018-02-16 14:48:28 The charts for LHC and NTC look good, no denying that. But I'm wary of holding hospital stocks going into next week's budget. I fear there may be a big shock re medical aid credits. It would be politically palatable if spun right and could raise as much as R20bn.
6207 2018-02-16 14:48:02 Yes! Ban semi automatic and automatic weapons. Control and track magazine clips, like certain drugs. Make bump stocks ILLEGAL, do not allow them to be manufactured any longer. The drinking age was raised to 21, but an 18 year old can purchase a gun legally?

6212 2018-02-16 14:46:48 Ban assault rifles, military grade weaponry, bump-stocks. Abolish the NRA--they make it profitable for Republicans to ignore the slaughter of American citizens. It is a terrorist organization; just ask our children who live in fear every day.
6213 2018-02-16 14:46:36 Part of the solution? They are Platitudes that don't solve a thing. How about banning military grade weapons, banning bump stocks, banning automatic weapons? I am SICK of the NRA NOT coming to the table.
6214 2018-02-16 14:46:25 I don’t know how comfortable it is I’ve never done it. Banning bump stocks is definitely a good idea, it’s one of my compromise points. You can really only hip fire while manually bumping, but you can shoulder the gun if you’re using a bump stock
6215 2018-02-16 14:46:22 Interesting, couple weeks ago on either Monday the 29th or Tuesday the 30th I had a revelation that VIX which you buy on the stock market was going to skyrocket. Owning VIX is actually a unique way to hedge against the risk of owning stocks because the price of VIX typically-

6223 2018-02-16 14:45:39 I agree that the NRA goes too far out of fear of the "slippery slope", and do wish they'd moderate more and come out strongly against things like bump stocks, which should NOT be sold anywhere. I'm not a member & do not take my cues from them

6232 2018-02-16 14:44:15 Bump stocks aren't illegal... why are semi automatic guns necessary? Why do we need 30 round clips? I can't see hunting being a very reasonable reason.

6234 2018-02-16 14:43:26 As bump stocks were originally developed for physical disabilities that prevent pulling trigger (I think a veteran designed it), then make them available by prescription only.
6235 2018-02-16 14:43:23 For that matter the actual new laws proposed in response to shootings have been so mild and half-a-loaf—banning bump stocks, etc.—that these concerns don’t seem to apply.
6236 2018-02-16 14:43:22 How about Wall St grab the brass ones off that bull out front and implement a freeze on all fire arm stocks after a mass shooting? That’ll solve the gun problem faster than you can say “LaPierre is a penis.”
6237 2018-02-16 14:43:21 Not to mention the “people will do it with other things that are dangerous” is not a legitimate argument. You can’t kill 58 people in a minute with a knife or even a car. You can with bump stocks and assault rifles.

6241 2018-02-16 14:42:43 Crazy to see crypto affecting stocks like overstock and square
6242 2018-02-16 14:42:41 Semantics in this situation are inconsequential. Similarly, discussing fire rates between weapons with bumps stocks and fully-automatic weapons are inconsequential. Whether you can empty a clip in 2 seconds or 1.5 seconds, it doesn't matter.
6243 2018-02-16 14:42:30 Yes. Please bring back the Reagan era ban on AR-15’s, expanded mags, and please add bump stocks.
6244 2018-02-16 14:42:26 As a gun owner I'm as 2A as any gun nut. But no one needs AR's and bump stocks.
6245 2018-02-16 14:42:24 Yield getting hit in stocks like REITS, utilities ... no surprise that HY is getting impacted.
6246 2018-02-16 14:42:24 Bump stocks do need to be illegal. I agree with you on that.

6249 2018-02-16 14:42:01 The N.R.A. can be beat. Guns were once necessary & something we learned about early & respected. Silencers, bump stocks & semi auto weapons exist only to kill people & because NRA has folks brainwashed into thinking it is a *right* to stock up a private arsenal.
#NRABloodMoney
6250 2018-02-16 14:41:59 YES - the 2nd amendment never anticipated assault rifles and bump stocks.
6251 2018-02-16 14:41:57 Was a bit under the weather past cupla days, but feelin quite a bit better this morning... thankfully (and thanx to a cupla tips from you folks), I had several stocks/bounces to keep me warm.
6252 2018-02-16 14:41:52 Yes, yes and yes. Be like Massachusetts and ban bump stocks also.
6253 2018-02-16 14:41:46 My initial point was that buying a coin is not like buying a share in the company. So any of the Ripple news catalysts have benefited the partners' stocks more like Moneygram. Look where the price was when they announced. Right under a historic price gap zone.
6254 2018-02-16 14:41:21 Like arrest law abiding immigrants while allowing the mentally disturbed to buy assault weapons? Permitting the sale of bump stocks and silencers? Cross state carry?
6255 2018-02-16 14:41:17 Which is what makes the GOP not making sales of bump stocks for semi automatic rifles ludicrous. They literally turn a now legal gun into a federally banned illegal gun. That’s what campaign $$ do for weak cowards posing as leaders.

How many more children's lives will it take before republicans will do anything?

They still haven't even banned bump stocks.
6258 2018-02-16 14:40:19 So you’re, saying that some arms—anti tank guns shouldn’t be available to your average law abiding citizen. Who drew that line? If not anti tank guns, why are other combat arms? Specifically why are AR-15s with large magazines and retrofitted with bump stocks available?

Close gun show loopholes

Limit magazine capacities

Promote smart guns

This won’t prevent all shootings but could help.

6312 2018-02-16 14:31:12 @SpeakerRyan The BLOOD of the PARKLAND 17 is on your hands for not supporting the ban of assault weapons and bump stocks. What a good Roman Catholic you are. Pope Francis and your Parish Priest most be very proud of you.

6325 2018-02-16 14:29:10 1) Here are some solutions
A. Congress pass law that enables FBI to actually study and document effect of weapons in mass shootings/gun violence- has not been passed by Congress since 1996
B. Legislation to ban bump stocks C. Reverse bill that 45 signed that eases ability of...
6326 2018-02-16 14:29:00 Absolutely and include high capacity clips and bump stocks. Oh and while you're at it how about passing a new law that keeps guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.
6327 2018-02-16 14:28:57 Yes, and bump stocks and high capacity magazines, and "no fly, no gun".

6333 2018-02-16 14:27:51 Bump stocks. Ban them, as on on their own they are not firearms. As I said earlier DNA/ID tagged guns(similar to those in MGS4) would be a good solution
6334 2018-02-16 14:27:41 Yes!! A thousand times yes. True hunters have no use for them. They quite simply destroy the animal and make it useless for any other purpose. 
Tell a real hunter to climb into a tree with a bow and arrow.  That’s *sport*.

6344 2018-02-16 14:25:53 Yep, I do. It's a rifle that fires a single round every time trigger is pressed. Self loading. With attached tools (bump stocks etc), you can get 600 RPM - that's the kicker
6345 2018-02-16 14:25:51 Compromise is surrender on the installment plan.  You’d take bump stocks today, magazines tomorrow, ARs next week, then conjure an “assault weapon” and take that.  Then you’d have some momentum...

As gun owners are intent in following the original constitution of 1787,  I think we can agree that you can own ALL the muskets you want!!
6356 2018-02-16 14:22:22 I will vote for anyone who has the guts to push reasonable gun control laws. Expanded background checks, registration. Bans on bump stocks and the AR-15. Does not accept NRA contributions. It's past time to start the conversation.
6357 2018-02-16 14:22:12 Very troubling here in Ft Lauderdale at the War Memorial this weekend AR Rifles will be on sale as well as bump stocks. What will it take to break the control of the NRA over our Government? Enough has blood has been shed and children do not deserve. Russia donates to NRA crazy!

Sane or Unbalanced, the common denominator is AR-15s & Bump Stocks. Add 'em to the BAN-NOW
6360 2018-02-16 14:21:02 Start is good.
Hope @realDonaldTrump will listen to u.

But when does a common man ever need an assault rifle with bump stocks, really.

Then again his buddy #nra will stop finding his failed business

6361 2018-02-16 14:20:59 It will be a full house. The sales pitch will be "Great deals on AR 15s, High Capacity Mags, and Bump Stocks...get 'em before they're banned!" Like it's almost ones patriotic duty to buy them...."Don't you love Merika, boy?"
6362 2018-02-16 14:20:51 It's not enough. They found evidence of unfair practices but wont replicate a successful model - why? Saying it's too complex or the current gca could not cope are poor excuses.

6364 2018-02-16 14:20:42 kea!! seems like she still have some stocks left. and all the sets looks so temptingly cute
6365 2018-02-16 14:20:33 Banning guns is too far in my opinion. What I think should be done are things that responsible owners should support. Background checks (including social media) on ALL firearm purchases, banning bump stocks, eliminating high capacity magazines, proof of safety training...
6366 2018-02-16 14:20:12 the problem is you have to propose a specific policy change. you can't just scream gun control at the heavens. propose specific policies that accurately define weapons and attachments and there will be agreement. The @NRA supports banning bump stocks if they are defined correctly

6369 2018-02-16 14:19:28 No it doesn't. No limits on auto weapons even though the fbi is Told to keep track. No background checks. Bump stocks are still available. Social media don't report. Unless you're a Russian bot. People's reports don't get investigated thoroughly. Most schools don't have Barriers.
6370 2018-02-16 14:19:07 @CTULocal1 when AKs aiming@kids proliferate in tandem with white supremacy, egged on by @realDonaldTrump ,who would rather cut food stamps than bump stocks, we need a "political revolution."
6371 2018-02-16 14:18:41 All the Rabid gun owners out there please try to understand that the gun Amendment going back to the founding fathers did not apply to bump stocks or AR-15s no one wants to take away your guns but no one needs an AR-15 to go hunting. It's for killing people
6372 2018-02-16 14:18:34 NOW they want to talk about mental health? Who's paying for that after they gut the ACA and Medicare?  

Typical distraction from regulating bump stocks and weapons of war. 

THEY. DON'T. CARE.

6373 2018-02-16 14:18:29 What about bump stocks and clips that can hold 30 rounds?   Should they be banned?

6376 2018-02-16 14:17:38 That explains why Australia hasn’t had a school shooting since 1996. the NRA is responsible for preventing even the slightest common sense gun measures from taking into effect. Most gun owners are for expanded background checks and banning bump stocks but not the NRA
6377 2018-02-16 14:17:26 Since Congress can't pass even to abolish bum stocks, why can't WE the ppl vote basic gun reform into law

6383 2018-02-16 14:14:17 Semi automatic automatic and bump stocks need be banned. Illegal to own one. And guns should be registered like our car pink slip when sold
6384 2018-02-16 14:13:50 BTW, I think that in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Massachusetts was the only state to enact legislation banning bump stocks. It has actually been signed into law and has gone into effect.

6390 2018-02-16 14:11:00 I used to agree but no more. I believe we need to repeal the 2nd and start over. 30-day waiting period, mandatory firearms safety education, no AR-15 type weapons, no bump stocks, etc. As long as there is a 2nd A, the NRA will push the slippery slope crap.

6395 2018-02-16 14:09:16 Hectorville 4 dead really compares with our 20+ dead?  Why not do something to try and stop this?

6397 2018-02-16 14:09:08 Bump stock or no, it’s still easier to release more shots from a semiautomatic than a handgun. I know. I’ve shot both. Again, it’s still an accessibility issue.

6420 2018-02-16 14:02:41 The bump stock was the primary enabler of the LV shooter to kill so many people. You don't think that a ban on bump stocks would have "in any way at all" saved at least one single life in Las Vegas?

6427 2018-02-16 14:01:22 And it's a bump stock, not stop. And stop telling yourself that our society problems revolving around mass murder somehow is result of bump stocks. We need more security, armed faculty, better parents, and mental health awareness. This kid had every red flag in the book

6441 2018-02-16 13:57:12 They're absolutely NOT asking for removal of all guns.  Certain weapons and attachments like bump stocks.  These have one purpose. Kill many in short amount of time.
6442 2018-02-16 13:57:01 Why are bump stocks still legal and on the shelves? You are supposed to have a Class 3 FFL to own an automatic rifle legally. That item let’s you skirt the law and they won’t even take out that.
6443 2018-02-16 13:56:59 Thats the safe play tho... if I wanted to play safe i would buy more stocks... obviously dont buy at all time highs but this is still a 50% discount...
6444 2018-02-16 13:56:50 Massachusetts banned bump stocks after the Las Vegas Massacre. Gun laws save lives!
6445 2018-02-16 13:56:42 Donny, you are clearly #NotARealPresident! You are supposed to be working for We The People! Get on Universal Health Care, that includes solid mental healthcare coverage! And get going on restrictions for automatic and semi-automatic weapons (and bump stocks/conversion kits)!
6446 2018-02-16 13:56:39 1) bump stocks are still legal-turns semi-auto into auto with one click;
2) would have liked a more thoughtful response, Mostly Mild, but u inadvertently hit on a critical truth: the myth & problem of testosterone-fueled ego...u don’t think Aussies are equally kickass? Or Brits?
6447 2018-02-16 13:56:26 The hit the gun industry would take, there are so many investors and stocks being hold not to mention the people that are employed there. With the hit so many people would be without a job and millions of dollars would be lost and the economy would decline
6448 2018-02-16 13:54:52 It would help the debate if the anti-gun people would learn enough to get their facts straight. An AR-15 is not an assault rifle, the "AR" stands for Armalite, the company that made them initially. Ban fully automatic weapons, bump stocks. But get the facts straight.
6449 2018-02-16 13:54:36 t will take a generation, best case, but that is no reason not to start. There are 300m guns.  We need massive voluntary gun buy backs and severe restrictions on new purchases. Bump stocks, large magazines, unregulated ammo sales, etc need to be severely curtailed.
6450 2018-02-16 13:54:29 Best stocks to invest in are the ones associated to New World Order and invade our Privacy! #invest#stocks
6451 2018-02-16 13:54:19 STATES have full power to protect/secure every public school - why aren't you promoting better security first?  Let's get the facts on Cruz's details too.  Most R's + NRA were FOR banning Bump Stocks - they're unnecessary additions to alter a gun's created use.
6452 2018-02-16 13:54:04 It can be done very easily (as far as these things go), but is a serious crime to do so. Devices like “bump stocks” can replicate the feel but are legal.
6453 2018-02-16 13:53:34 Why don't we start with banning bump stocks?

And I'd prefer to have a conversation not a meme repost volley. I don't care about your memes. I highly doubt Thomas Jefferson had AR-15s in mind.
6454 2018-02-16 13:53:16 @SenatorCollins are  you for or against banning assault weapons, re-activating Obama-era limitations on the access of mentally ill people to guns, banning bump stocks, creating age limits for gun purchases, waiting periods for gun purchases?
6455 2018-02-16 13:53:15 Agreed. But it seemed like bump stocks had some traction until suddenly they were no longer considered...
6456 2018-02-16 13:53:00 Oh no they’re not, AR 15 semi-automatic killing machines are all over the place, including used by the latest killer of school children. And when bump stocks are added it makes them into automatic weapons
6457 2018-02-16 13:52:53 I'll bet if someone's kid in the white house or congress was killed at school they would think differently about guns and gun control and perhaps not think so much about their mansions, vacations, Mercedes, yachts, planes, and stocks. 
#GunContolNow
6458 2018-02-16 13:52:30 Enact the ban on assault weapons high capacity magazines bump stocks. Increase regulation or implement licensing for existing guns. Make America Safe Again.
6459 2018-02-16 13:52:28 *After Las Vegas shooting*

Republicans: The problem is bump stocks, we need to ban bump stocks. 

*After Parkland shooting*

Republicans: Mental health is the problem, we need to focus on mental health. 

America is such a funny place I swear
6460 2018-02-16 13:52:14 RT @RH_WyCo: @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson There is absolutely no sane reason people should be allowed to own assault rifles, bump stocks, or large clips. These are designed to kill people, not hunting. You can't even use them hunting, there illegal for it.
6461 2018-02-16 13:52:05 So not one word about yet another massacre.  NRA put $$ in your pocket, too?  If you don't have the guts to be a senator in ND and advocate and DO something about banning silencers, assault rifles, bump stocks, background checks, you have no business being in Congress, /1
6462 2018-02-16 13:51:52 We need to get AR-15s and bump stocks off the streets. It may not prevent these things, but it can certainly lessen the body count.
6463 2018-02-16 13:51:47 I beg to differ, does that mean one shouldn’t buy a second house as an investment if you buy stocks? Same goes for Crypto, diversity can be more profitable than just buying BTC if you into short term gains. Actually the entire statement is stupid
6464 2018-02-16 13:51:39 yeah, the 'outrage' over bump stocks lasted all of about 2 weeks.....

6468 2018-02-16 13:50:06 Prove it, not by lowering flags but by passing laws to ban the sale of assault rifles and bump stocks. Pass laws to increase background checks and require training to purchase firearms. Copy the exact laws that Australia has.

6476 2018-02-16 13:49:32 At a minimum we must demand congress ban military style assault weapons, bump stocks & provide funding for mental health.  If they can’t or won’t do it, we will vote them out & the NRA.  We must do this for #Parkland & all the families hurt by gun violence
6477 2018-02-16 13:49:16 Remember how lawmakers from both parties promised after the Las Vegas slaughters they would move quickly to outlaw bump stocks to avoid similar episodes. Nothing. No such law yet. These people should be charged with aiding & abetting these massacres. Take action, DC. NRA rules!
6478 2018-02-16 13:48:51 Banning assault weapons and bump stocks is OBVIOUS. 
Why doesn't it happen? NRA money. Corrupt: @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP @SpeakerRyan @senrobportman @RepSteveChabot

6484 2018-02-16 13:46:03 I don’t think anyone seriously talks about getting rid of guns. But ARs? Bump stocks?  Why does anyone need them if not to maximize carnage?
6485 2018-02-16 13:45:59 NO citizen has reason to own an AR-15.  
Call your @GOP to ask them,
“Why AR-15's, bump stocks, etc. should be sold to the civilian population?”
6486 2018-02-16 13:45:58 @ChrisCuomo I OWN an AR15 I am a DEMOCRAT I wish all news outlets would talk about the accessories you can buy for these guns I hunt with mine but I use a 10 round clip 30 round clips should be banned bump stocks banned you can buy 40 round drum clips for shotguns it's stupid
6487 2018-02-16 13:45:12 I check my stocks and crypto more than social networking and that’s a good feeling 
6488 2018-02-16 13:45:02 Michelle, assault style rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors all need to be outlawed. Gun ownership should be qualified and regulated.
6489 2018-02-16 13:44:43 @realDonaldTrump  What can you do? You can:  reinstate restrictions on mentally ill people getting guns; work to outlaw bump stocks; outlaw assault and military type weapons for non- military purchase; strengthen background checks; stand up to the NRA OR you can just shut up.

6494 2018-02-16 13:43:53 You know why Kinder Eggs and Lawn Darts are banned in this country, but big-ass guns, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks aren’t? Because the Kinder Egg And Lawn Dart people didn’t have better lobbyists.

6497 2018-02-16 13:42:14 @SlideFireSol 
Stop making these bump stocks. There is absolutely no reason to make or sell such weapons
6498 2018-02-16 13:41:56 How would you propose to stop gun violence?  What practical solutions are there?  Banning drum magazines, bump-stocks, hi-capacity mags, silencers/suppressors, scary looking rifles or "assault" rifles?  Banning ownership, banning sales, confiscation?
6499 2018-02-16 13:41:41 Normal people freak when their stocks and investments are going down.. while I'm sitting here WANTING this thing to dive so I can pick up some more at a "discount"

6503 2018-02-16 13:40:10 Actually the 5.56 NATO is designed a bit different and does more catastrophic soft tissue damage....but yes, they are both effective rounds. Bump@stocks should be banned. It’s not semantics. One is designed for for military the other is not. One is full auto the other not.
6504 2018-02-16 13:40:05 Then tell fellow democrats to allow a clean bump stocks law.

6509 2018-02-16 13:37:44 Ryan's hyperbole is sickening.

Ryan wont address bump stocks. He wont address easy availability of gun of choice in mass shootings - AR-15. He wont address high capacity magazines/clips. He wont address improving screening, mental health prohibitions, etc.
6510 2018-02-16 13:37:32 How would you propose to stop gun violence, Debra?  What practical solutions are there?  Banning drum magazines, bump-stocks, hi-capacity mags, silencers/suppressors, scary looking rifles or "assault" rifles?  Banning ownership, banning sales, confiscation?
6511 2018-02-16 13:37:06 Meanwhile the gun manufactures stocks and gun sales go higher.
6512 2018-02-16 13:37:06 unlicensed supressors have been felonies... and banning bump stocks wont do anything. and whats wrong with concealed carry?
6513 2018-02-16 13:36:55 No sir, the law was poorly written and probably unconstitutional. Law makers agreed to leave it alone for fear that it would be overturned. ATF needs to rule on things like bump stocks individually as a result, and there is a high burden of proof.
6514 2018-02-16 13:36:30 While many AR-15s can be purchased for less than $1,000, sights, grips, stocks and other accessories can cost hundreds of dollars. This 100-round drum magazine costs $116.99.
6515 2018-02-16 13:36:21 would it be possible when becoming a senator to purchase a bunch of stocks at a low price and influence a decision in the direction that would increase their stocks? Wouldn't that be against the law? Wondering how the Senators become Millionaires in 4 years.

6531 2018-02-16 13:30:23 NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE were shot in Las Vegas with a bump stock that makes a semiautomatic assault rifle fully automatic. Bipartisan support for banning bump stocks, but it has gone nowhere.

The debate over whether our government is broken begins and ends with guns.
6532 2018-02-16 13:29:50 BUMP STOCKS!  How in the hell do you think the massive Las Vegas murders occurred?  They need to be illegal too.
6533 2018-02-16 13:28:29 You are completely right. Especially since shooters modify the AR-15’s (semi-automatic rifle) bump stock so the rifle can fire bullets as fast as an automatic rifle. AR-15’s legal and bump stocks are legal. You see the problem 
6534 2018-02-16 13:27:58 There’s a relatively long list of possibilities that protect gun rights while restoring some sanity to gun laws.  Reinstated assault weapons ban, ban on extended magazines and bump stocks, strengthened background checks with some prohibitions for certain categories.
6535 2018-02-16 13:27:48 Good morning.  Back to watching the penny stock market.  3 day weekend so could be slow day.  Holding a number of stocks and awaiting news and/or material events.  Will post if I see something.
6536 2018-02-16 13:27:21 It all comes down to money. The people in DC won’t change things because it takes money from their pockets. I think bump stocks and high capacity clips need to go away for sure. There is no reason to have 30 bullets in a clip. And this is coming from a gun owner.
6537 2018-02-16 13:27:11 Wait until the #BlueTsunami2018 Watch those stocks plummet.
6538 2018-02-16 13:26:50 This is terrific but too passive. Push to reinstate #AssaultWeaponsBan include bump stocks, magazines & other “accessories” of mass destruction. Enough is enough. Be specific about legislation we know will make a difference-now is the time!

Also make ammunition harder to get
Ban large clips and bump stocks
Close background check and registration loopholes
Require gun owners to hold liability insurance.
Move to safe gun technology
6545 2018-02-16 13:24:15 If interest rate were to rise. How would that would that affect bad debt? I spoke to a rich sport better from Las Vegas I asked him how did you get rich he said stocks and bonds. At the time I had no idea what that meant.
6546 2018-02-16 13:23:44 NRA buys our representatives so do nothing but make worse. Greed/biz. Bump-stocks now silencers to shoot cops like sitting ducks w/out checks. F.Fathers know insanity-asking for mass murder! So long as can mow down everything mass-killer assault weapons, kids+US@ ever higher risk

6550 2018-02-16 13:21:55 Tightening gun laws to prevent the sale of bump stocks and requiring more robust background checks isn’t the same as disarming an entire population.
6551 2018-02-16 13:21:30 Splitting hairs? It's about the amount of $$ the NRA contributes to GOP.  Does the GOP & NRA have will to ban bump stocks? It would be a start.  I hate walking into  college classroom thinking about safety of me & my students. I should be thinking about creating great learning
6552 2018-02-16 13:20:36 Look at every other country that US likes to compare itself with & ask the question:
Why is ANY gun easy to get in the US?
THAT is the problem - not assault rifles, silencers, bump stocks or whatever else.
GUNS, readily available & 300 millions of them in the US, is the problem!
6553 2018-02-16 13:20:20 As I said, sensible gun control is great. The public has no need for bump stocks. No need for assault rifles. People identified having mental health issues should not be able to purchase a weapon. Federal registry and tracking needs to b way better. It won't fix it tho.
6554 2018-02-16 13:19:16 Today I challenge you to drain that swamp by discussing and creating sensible gun laws.  You and your Republican friends promised to ban bump stocks months ago and still we have nothing.  You live up to your promises?  PROVE IT!
6555 2018-02-16 13:19:04 Great that is my point. Sounds like you will have no issue regulating bump stocks, and semi automatic guns. Or maybe re-instituting the measure sought to block some people with severe mental health problems from buying guns, that Trump repealed back in 2017.
6556 2018-02-16 13:18:58 Bump stocks, like what was used in Vegas, are not federally illegal. Many states and municipalities are working on it. The NRA even supported the ban and this idiot Congress still can do anything.
6557 2018-02-16 13:18:33 @ACLU if gun manufacturers can’t be sued cld the ppl who were shot in Las Vegas sue the makers of bump stocks? Some of those ppl can’t pay their medical bills. Shldnt the makers of the bump stocks be held responsible? Genuinely curious.
6558 2018-02-16 13:18:26 #diversification everyone should have dividend stocks in portfolio.
6559 2018-02-16 13:18:03 Of course they do. Just like bump stocks after Vegas.
6560 2018-02-16 13:17:55 @JoeNBC vote Republicans out who are against background checks, assault rifle ban, bump stocks ban, etc., as David Jolly of Florida former congress man said. Kick them out.

6562 2018-02-16 13:17:24 Semi Automatics and bump stocks ALL SHOULD BE BANNED!
6563 2018-02-16 13:17:18 You are truly confused. No one wants to get rid of guns. Just bump stocks & assault type weapons. Even Reagan and Scalia were in favor of banning assault type weapons. Check the facts.
6564 2018-02-16 13:17:03 SHAME on you, PAUL Ryan!  U are WEAK,  AVOIDING this horrific gun issue!!!  AR-15 assault Guns and bump stocks??  Civilians do NOT need these!  GET REAL, RYAN, OR GET OUT!!
6565 2018-02-16 13:16:58 Don’t forget the first clause in the 2A. School shooters, Vegas shooters, etc., are not “A well regulated Militia.” Also, the right to bear arms isn’t the right to bear automatic rifles, bump stocks, assault weapons, tanks, nuclear weapons… Limits always apply.
6566 2018-02-16 13:16:51 What is the point of this narrative? The NRA has suggested the ATF put some limits on bump stocks, why doesn't congress act to "put the pieces together", this is BS narrative - what do you suggest could have been done? use your congressional voice to act on it
6567 2018-02-16 13:16:45 SHAME on you, PAUL Ryan!  U are WEAK,  AVOIDING this horrific gun issue!!!  AR-15 assault Guns and bump stocks??  Civilians do NOT need these!  GET REAL, RYAN, OR GET OUT!!
6568 2018-02-16 13:16:44 Make it harder to kill mass amounts of people, smaller magazines, no bump stocks, more thorough background checks

6571 2018-02-16 13:16:33 This is some Alex Jones dribble if there has ever been any. Fear mongering if a government take over without precious AR's and AK's. People treat them as pretty toys with fully modded stocks, grips, and sites they'll never have a need for.
6572 2018-02-16 13:16:26 But we are talking about shitty low float otc stocks for the most part
6573 2018-02-16 13:16:02 Here you are wasting your view on Guns, Bump Stocks, do you fear coming up with what the real issue is. Mentally Troubled, Bullied & Angry.
6574 2018-02-16 13:15:53 "an investor in Bridgewater’s Pure Alpha Major Markets strategy told Reuters earlier this month the firm  was slightly long European stocks"
6575 2018-02-16 13:15:43 I agree with you that citizens don't need AR-15's with bump stocks. But if we let the government take all the guns away, who is going to stop them from having complete control over us?
6576 2018-02-16 13:14:38 Good day to buy buy and buy low demand stocks!
6577 2018-02-16 13:14:38 You are truly a suck person if you think a party paid for the shooting. Probably a Russian bit. No one wants to take the constitution or your guns - just assault weapons and bump stocks. Reagan and Scalia were in favor of banning assault weapons
6578 2018-02-16 13:14:30 @evanspiegel if your not careful with your customers your not going to have any, your stocks high right now but when people start switching to Instagram, your stocks going to just disappear and you'll be sad and alone, give us the old version back.

6580 2018-02-16 13:13:59 You can't even outlaw bump stocks because you're so bad at your job. They aren't even guns. They're just something that make guns more deadly. Just resign now
6581 2018-02-16 13:13:56 Gun control is never the GOP answer.  They are happy to let our children be slaughtered so they can keep their assault rifles, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks.
6582 2018-02-16 13:13:50 Finally, we need to be 21 to get a License to carry or possess high capacity magazines.  AR and other Assault style rifles, bump stocks and trigger cranks are all banned.  All firearms are required to be locked up with the ammo stored separately.  Know what?  Hasn't hurt me a bit

6590 2018-02-16 13:10:24 Frankly if I invested in individual stocks I could see the attraction of putting some money in $OSTK even though it is a POS and a fraud, pushed by a POS and fraud. The risk is that it could evaporate and one is left holding the bag.
6591 2018-02-16 13:09:50 My name is @SpeakerRyan. I am complicit in the murder of children. I refuse to limit high capacity magazines. I am complicit in the Vegas massacre. I refuse to ban bumper stocks. I love the 3 million in blood money from the @NRA

6597 2018-02-16 13:07:00 Sur ce sujet crucial @faureolivier sait de quoi il parle. L'humanité avec laquelle il traite ces sujets et ce même dans le choix des mots, tranche net avec la brutalité de la politique du Gvt #Macron et avec la sémantique "du tri et des stocks" utilisée par @gerardcollomb.
6598 2018-02-16 13:06:58 We start today with $XBI stats very mildly bullish. Above BB stocks in high single digits. Below: 1-2. High RSI: 3. Low: 1. Nothing extreme YET. MAs probably perfectly stacked again - have not checked all.
6599 2018-02-16 13:06:53 And after the #VegasShooting when most of Americans agreed bump stocks shouldn’t be lawful and most politicians, even the Rs agreed but all efforts just went away, you don’t know that the @NRA was the silencer.

2) no bump stocks
3) 50% of gun revenues go to paying for metal detectors and armed staff at schools
4) people with any history of mental illness have a longer process and mental health eval before purchase.

6607 2018-02-16 13:01:30 Wow! Big deal! U want to be a great president, save r children! Ban military assault weapons, ban multi clip ammunition, ban bump stocks, ban semi automatic weapons. Make it illegal to except donations from NRA. And reverse that bill making it easier for mentally ill to get guns.

6612 2018-02-16 12:56:09 No clue but that's not the goal. the goal is to keep as many children alive and safe as possible. AR-15s, non-universal background checks, giant loopholes, bump stocks all make it easier for these things to happen. and for no good reason.
6613 2018-02-16 12:55:46 @timseymour Folks talking about cyber security are too young to remember when I began a 35 year Wall Street and commodities/futures career in 1968 in Philly when we opened the window and screamed across the alley for bids and offers of our stocks and bonds, more...
6614 2018-02-16 12:54:43 Yeah, right. continue praying while NRA continue selling AR 15, bump stocks and in a close future silencers. #ThoughtsandPrayers turn in an easy excuse to avoid political responsibilities.
6615 2018-02-16 12:53:52 Mr. President this is the time to put a ban on all bump stocks and assault rifles. Why would the average citizen need this?
6616 2018-02-16 12:53:51 But all they see is another spike in gun stocks
6617 2018-02-16 12:53:40 Hollow analogies. Americans can’t buy surface-to-air missiles capable of blowing up passenger jets. But why can we buy AR15’s? Bump stocks?
6618 2018-02-16 12:53:04 Dent was just on #MorningJoe a few minutes ago, mentioned how ridiculous that Congress can't even do background checks or bump stocks. If all Republicans were like him, I'd feel better about America's survival

6620 2018-02-16 12:51:51 I pretty much ignored it. It was obvious volatility had more to do with manipulation than a "technical correction."

6626 2018-02-16 12:50:59 Yet this “mentally disturbed “ was able to buy a gun. He had to pass the requirements to buy this type of gun. All bump stocks and assault rifles should be banned.
6627 2018-02-16 12:50:58 @Saccone4PA18 @ConorLambPA Dear Lawmakers  Are U such cowards 2? are U willing to put the NRA above children? would U repealed a law  to limit persons deemed mentally ill from obtaining weapons?  would you  pass a restriction on Bump Stocks.

6633 2018-02-16 12:49:50 Bump stocks should be illegal, high capacity magazines should be illegal, semi automatic weapons should be illegal. Gifting guns should require background checks, online sales and gun shows should require background checks. 2nd amendment would still be intact.
6634 2018-02-16 12:49:27 I'm going to Tweet the performance of all the stocks I own across three brokerage accounts in a few moments. Freel free to follow me @emmetsavage  if that kind of stuff interests you.
6635 2018-02-16 12:48:19 How about starting with bump stocks. After all, fully automatic guns are banned. Why should someone be able to make a semi a fully?  Also, I still think my right to life trumps the right to own whatever gun one wants.
6636 2018-02-16 12:47:39 Actually started making a profit from my stocks, maybe things are starting to get better
6637 2018-02-16 12:47:33 All show - he was the one allowing bump stocks that made semi autos (like used in the shooting) into full autos (which are technically banned since 1986)

6641 2018-02-16 12:47:06 2/ There actually was some area of compromise possible with the bump stock issue for the NRA/GOP. But then Feinstein‘s bill included banning everything from bump stocks to AR15‘s to pistol grip‘s to detachable magazines to muzzleloaders. Whatever we give It’s just never enough.

6643 2018-02-16 12:46:29 @SpeakerRyan: Is it time yet to talk about banning bump stocks? Las Vegas was 4 months ago. You always say "it's not time" right after your most recently sponsored mass shooting to discuss gun restrictions. Let us know your timing on this.

6645 2018-02-16 12:44:22 No analysis necessary. No fucking assault weapons in this country. No fucking bump stocks. Mentally ill identified. Long wait background checks. Want to play army? Serve in the military. Then you’ll see what it really feels like when someone dies at your hand.

6649 2018-02-16 12:42:24 Assault style rifles, high capacity magazines, suppressors, bump stocks all need to be outlawed. Laws must be passed and enforced to make gun ownership qualified and regulated.

6653 2018-02-16 12:41:08 Do I believe banning guns is the answer? No. Could our gov't pass legislation to prevent some of these things from happening (bump stocks, better screening, etc)? Absolutely. It's worth a try b/c what we're doing now isn't working.
There's just no moderation anymore.
6654 2018-02-16 12:38:10 Similar to Air Berlin imo. Reckless CEO with 30% of the stocks, expanding too fast, juggling with peoples livelihood, with noone questioning the choises made. Counting on 3 strong summer-months extremely risky..

6657 2018-02-16 12:37:52 I am not an NRA member but after Las Vegas they came out with a statement asking Congress to further investigate bump stocks....the device used to transform a semi-automatic to a fully automatic....read cues of mental illness...repair families...
6658 2018-02-16 12:37:52 Let's start with background checks, ban the sale of high capacity magazines & make bump stocks illegal.

All of this fear of losing rights & needing guns is because they fear the need to fight their own gov. That time might be here but they are on the wrong side.
6659 2018-02-16 12:37:16 Senator Graham. I commend you on bump stocks, but you need to rethink the whole AR-15 ban. I support gun rights. But the AR-15 has no purpose any longer except to kill and kill lots of folks quite effectively. Be the voice of reason like you have been. @LindseyGrahamSC
6660 2018-02-16 12:36:44 Specifically AR-15 and bump stocks, I am a carrying liberal, I understand the difference, heck I have an AR-15 in my gun case right now, tell me where to turn it in......I have a permit to carry legally....tell me where to turn it in....would gladly to save lives.
6661 2018-02-16 12:36:36 @RepCharlieDent Bump stocks do not change a damn thing about how a gun fires and you can bump fire without one. 

So a Dad has to do a bkgrnd check on his son to give him his 1st .22?

6666 2018-02-16 12:32:13 No they wouldn't they would still want to keep their semi-automatic rifles and their bump stocks. They think the government coming after them they want to be prepared. Don't let them b******* you

6671 2018-02-16 12:31:47 "You could say that right now, rather than stocks rising around the world, it is the dollar falling against almost everything."
6672 2018-02-16 12:31:44 @cspanwj Ban AR-15s, other assault weapons, bump stocks, high-capacity magazines & other paraphernalia; implement stringent universal background checks; longer waiting periods; enforce gun-free zones; severe penalties for non-compliance; register & license every gun.
6673 2018-02-16 12:31:41 People said that same thing about $amzn for years. Some stocks get a pass on fundamentals for years when you have a group of investors who believe in the long term goal of a company, and $tsla has been getting that same pass. You said if yourself, the chart doesn't lie.
6674 2018-02-16 12:31:02 Scalise is trotted out by GOP to defend NRA agenda, STFU. GOP will never support legislation banning assault rifles, banning bump stocks, banning concealed carry. Vote GOP OUT OF OFFICE as they have refused to commit to keeping us safe through responsible gun law reform.

6681 2018-02-16 12:30:01 Can Investors Short Sell OTC Stocks? Although short selling is allowed on these securities traded over-the-counter, it is not without its share of potential problems.
6682 2018-02-16 12:29:59 You hit nail on the head!  But they will NEVER get it. I commend @jimmykimmel for being the voice for the American ppl. When 2nd amdmnt written by forefathers there weren't; bump stocks. Assault rifles, magazines that held 100's of rounds & so many crazy dangerous ppl #GunLaws
6683 2018-02-16 12:29:37 1. The semi-automatic weapon can be altered to full auto in a HS machine shop                                                 2. Banning Bump-Stocks is akin to bandages on victims of a nuclear holocaust
6684 2018-02-16 12:29:31 Actually he was mentally ill and in fact filled a form and passed the background check that's when gun control should kick in
So yeahhh
The Vegas shooter was able to buy bump stocks, why not banned them from the country. That's when #GunControlNow comes in

6688 2018-02-16 12:28:35 Why are gun rights advocates so opposed to outlawing bump stocks?
6689 2018-02-16 12:28:22 I don’t see why we can’t ban the bump stocks and magazines that turn an ordinary rifle into a killing machine. Why would people in their right mind need that? It’s the mentally disturbed with evil intentions that buy them.
6690 2018-02-16 12:27:59 You would think after the mass murder of children something would have changed. Only thing that did was Gun stocks went up. Statistically they go up after every mass shootings.

6704 2018-02-16 12:24:57 Ban assault weapons, ban extended cartridges, limit the amount of ammo people can buy, ban bump stocks.

@cspanwj
6705 2018-02-16 12:24:32 The reason we do nothing about mass shootings is because of the money made on their stocks right after a shooting. They're all up AGAIN.
6706 2018-02-16 12:23:32 No, you’re not. Vast majority of Americans support universal background checks, banning assault weapons, limiting ammunition purchases, banning bump stocks, I could go on. You do nothing but offer cynical thoughts and prayers and say it’s always too soon. For GOP, guns > children
6707 2018-02-16 12:23:31 exactly...  just a few percent higher i thought @jimcramer was saying CEOs were asking him why their stocks got so high?  Imagine that! All the while the short vol trade was working and pushing vol to historical lows.  while market set records for up days with minimal down moves.
6708 2018-02-16 12:21:33 Surprising about your comments now given that bump stocks became legal under you.
6709 2018-02-16 12:21:29 So you agree with bump stocks?
6710 2018-02-16 12:20:36 So what exactly do you have against trigger locks, gun education, banning *just* assault style weapons, bump stocks and civilian use of armor piercing bullets?

6712 2018-02-16 12:19:44 @Morning_Joe Talk about how the stocks of the company that makes AR-15s soared yesterday.
6713 2018-02-16 12:19:39 Assault rifle is not a thing. It's an action. Also, bump stocks and cranks were designed for vets with physical handicaps (such as missing limbs from war) 

Most states have a license to transport. 

As for domestic violence ban, what good would that have done?
6714 2018-02-16 12:19:35 Carol I absolutely agree that you should be able to have a gun and a rifle. My hope is that the selling of assault rifles and bump stocks will stop. And that we can tighten gun registry and limit guns from reaching the hands of criminals, domestic abusers and the mentally ill.

   3. Clips holding more than 12 bullets, forbidden,
   4. Gun show loop allowing private sales without check
6727 2018-02-16 12:11:00 These are the same idiots who support the sale and ownership of assault rifles, bunt stocks and other weapons made for no other purpose than to kill people, LOTS of people. Only @realDonaldTrump listens to their lunacy: he counts on their support.

6756 2018-02-16 11:56:21 They apparently are NOT the majority! We, common sense Americans are! Ultimately Votes  are what matters! We need to elect law makers who cannot be bought!

6758 2018-02-16 11:55:47 People kill, yes, no need to be a rocket scientist to know that. The problem is the proliferation of the means to kill large numbers of people (aka bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles).  I'd take my chances against founding fathers' musket any day over an AR-15.

6775 2018-02-16 11:45:09 This is perhaps the saddest stmt. We should applaud the “courage” to maybe allow the CDC to study gun violence again? Not bring to the floor bipartisan gun reform? Not actually pass commonsense laws to ban bump stocks & assault rifles? Your thoughts&prayers aren’t enough. Act.
6776 2018-02-16 11:44:46 It is not as easy as just banning the guns. The 2A must be taken into consideration. Important changes should be easy.  1. Ban bump stocks PERIOD. 2. No guns should be in the hands of mentally ill, craft far more stringent background checks especially for buying AR-15s.
6777 2018-02-16 11:44:32 Except when you add a $50 piece of plastic known as a bump stock.  Then your semi-automatic AR-15 fires just like an automatic weapon.  And Congress couldn't even muster the political courage to ban bump stocks... #NRABloodMoney #ineptCongress
6778 2018-02-16 11:43:02 That's right, just let me promote MY agenda of the status quo: a gun in every hand, skyrocketing stocks in the gun companies, and a nice big donation from the NRA to my campaign.
6779 2018-02-16 11:41:14 Trump has took down the only protection of the gum stocks to be sold and he is also gave permission to the mental ill to buy these guns that President Obama put in place after the last mass shooting of a elementary school. Tell me Trump's protecting us. BS
6780 2018-02-16 11:41:08 If they've resorted to buying stocks after all these years of bailing out, bond buying, QE etc, that demonstrates an amazing lack of confidence in the state of our economy.
6781 2018-02-16 11:40:21 I seem to remember our dysfunctional CONGRESS getting rid of 'bump stocks'.  We should vote against anyone who thinks they can take guns.

6787 2018-02-16 11:36:54 You cannot convince me that it belongs in civilian hands... especially since, even after LV, we haven’t universally banned the sale of bump stocks.

6792 2018-02-16 11:35:00 I think the adviser knew full well. From what I've seen, the investments weren't explained/disclosed, some thought they were moving to e.g. Royal London, some signed as insistent clients without knowing what it meant. It's riddled with issues, that's the whole point.

6794 2018-02-16 11:33:39 Retweeted gandhi quotes (@gandhhii):

War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
6795 2018-02-16 11:33:05 Oliver  you didn't mention banning assault weapons and bump stocks - something that would actually have an impact in reducing the number of people killed.....I am fully in favor of guns just not those designed for war.
6796 2018-02-16 11:32:41 David, have you gotten a picture yet?   Seems like a reasonable request.   Also, do we know of any hand guns that can be equipped with bump stocks?
6797 2018-02-16 11:31:46 Nobody wants to take the guns away from people however nobody needs an assault rifle it’s only meant for murder and war bump stocks are made to kill more people at a time wake up vote them out of office
6798 2018-02-16 11:31:44 Explain the GOP inaction on limiting access to assault weapons and banning bump stocks rather than issuing theses insincere platitudes.  DO SOMETHING
6799 2018-02-16 11:31:35 I know what you're saying. I take the view that when the Value is clear and it's a Quality Business I am happy to wait - other Stocks in Portfolio will be doing well and a lazy Stock will perk up at some point. #ETO good example for me.
6800 2018-02-16 11:31:21 Hi @superdrug went into your Shipley store today for some makeup revolution bits... yet again another free offer on... 2nd time they didn’t have the stock though whilst an offer is on... so 2nd time I’ve missed out... I know it says while stocks last but... really?!? #nothappy
6801 2018-02-16 11:31:18 @benshapiro big fan Ben. For guns, pretty sure we can define specifically  what an assault rifle is and ban them. Stop all new sales of guns like AR15. Stop the sale of bump stocks. Those type of specific gun legislation goals are achievable and reasonable.

6803 2018-02-16 11:30:28 Sen McConnell, in addition to your prayers, please also pass common-sense gun legislation that protects our innocent children! Killing machines like the AR-15 and bump stocks have no place in our society! Please help save our children. You alone can do this.
6804 2018-02-16 11:30:01 Wall street and markets ( exchanges) make their money on activity but you make your money on inactivity. The key is to trade less... The concept that less is more rings true for long term performance.

#wallstreet #stocks
6805 2018-02-16 11:29:48 The congressman mentioned he had a half dozen suggestions.  Bump stocks, trigger locks, and looking into teens.  What else?
6806 2018-02-16 11:29:04 Okay #maga morons...the assault weapons ban was allowed to expire in 2004.  What’s happened with school shootings since then, and what type of weapon is being used?  C’mon, what’s the trend?  And yea automatics are illegal, but “bump-stocks” took care of that, didn’t it?
6807 2018-02-16 11:27:06 But I'm unclear... did their advisers not know??? 

Not being contrary, just can't reconcile IFA not knowing where they are investing their clients money.  

Can understand the client not knowing but in that case, they can complain about lack of disclosure by adviser.
6808 2018-02-16 11:26:59 Paul, you've just mansplained and this is not good.
6809 2018-02-16 11:26:44 If you’re intuitive.. you loaded up on gun stocks... then dumped em already 
6810 2018-02-16 11:25:55 Its sad to have lost her. But why must guns be traded like common stocks at the market in which ever lunatic can have access to it?  I bet gun violence will always create a problem in US
6811 2018-02-16 11:25:36 Half of our country just doesn’t care; guns are supremely important. They threaten murder if you even talk gun control. The democrats are feckless not saying ban guns; instead, they say maybe we could limit bump stocks if that’s ok?

6813 2018-02-16 11:24:49 Let’s ask Rubio and all the others to pray for money and ACT to defy the NRA in banning assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
6814 2018-02-16 11:24:30 Regardless if it's a scam or not (and the 'dev team' of LCC look pretty  scammy), the issue is that some investors/speculators bought into $LTC  over the past week in anticipation of getting 'free money' via the  fork, and that's driven the price up. Likely drop after fork.
6815 2018-02-16 11:22:51 This is the cowardly response to every school shooting, and the NRA’s. founded on the idiotic logic that we would be safer with “more guns in the hands of the good guys”. That’s why gun manufacturers stocks go up after school shootings. It’s not about guns. Its about the money
6816 2018-02-16 11:22:07 Always said only invest in sip and focus on stocks below 50. Markets down but stocks green
6817 2018-02-16 11:21:33 It’s the only purpose of AR-15’s. It’s the only purpose of high magazine rounds. It’s the only purpose of silencers, and it’s the only purpose of bump stocks.

That’d be a decent start.

6829 2018-02-16 11:15:41 The gov can pass laws requiring testing, can study causes of gun violence, can make laws for mandatory licencing and insurance. They can ban things like bump stocks and silencers that make it easier to murder. Your right to bear arms doesn't trump everyone else's right to live.
6830 2018-02-16 11:14:42 Mr. President, @realDonaldTrump you have used your pen to deport dreamers, to turn around other administrations laws but you can't use that pen to ban Bump stocks and the AR15..they aren't for real hunters they are for killers. Do something for the kids.
6831 2018-02-16 11:11:58 The only guns anyone wants taken away are AK47 and AR15 and other automatics. Stop selling bump stocks. Nobody is hunting or protecting their homes with these items. They’re killing people with them! That is their only use.
6832 2018-02-16 11:11:45 Nope. It’s with UK stocks.
6833 2018-02-16 11:11:41 Except for bump stocks. Like in Las Vegas. The only function there is to approximate an automatic weapon.
6834 2018-02-16 11:11:33 Ryan, just be honest. Tell us it's only a few dead kids. No big deal. Tell us that if we do gun control your stocks will go down and you'll have less money.  Tell us about all the angry phone calls you'll get from your donors. 

Tell us about your terrible fucking problems.

6840 2018-02-16 11:07:20 We all can massage the data for either sides arguments. If your listening, seriously then we need to take action and outlaw bump stocks - AR15 - high capacity mags - or allow everyone to have an RPG.
6841 2018-02-16 11:05:39 The Aussie market faded away again. Not convinced we are heading higher just yet. looking for relative strength in individual stocks atm.
6842 2018-02-16 11:05:37 I say ban guns like the AR-15. There’s no reason for the public to own something like that; there really isn’t. It’s a military weapon of war. Ban accessories that allow any kind of gun to fire like an automatic (bump stocks). Common fucking sense

6847 2018-02-16 11:01:40 Unlike bump stocks, which makes restricting automatic weapons kind of redundant
6848 2018-02-16 11:00:13 The AR is just a rifle save for the rails which allow multiple mounts it is no different than a classic hunting rifle. The AR is not a stand alone issue or solution. High capacity mags, bump stocks, binary triggers, trigger wheels, etc need to be addressed. Gun issues are many

6859 2018-02-16 10:54:27 The majority of NRA members support   common sense gun control laws. For example, the NRA supported legislation to ban “bump stocks.” The NRA polls its members regularly. The figure is about 80%. And the honest answer to what Chelsea wrote is that we are each riddled w/conflicts
6860 2018-02-16 10:54:27 That BS ain't about nothin.' 
After the Vegas Massacre the same "Thoughts & Prayers" Scoundrels said they were going to outlaw Bump Stocks too. Didn't happen.

6861 2018-02-16 10:54:14 Meanwhile this is the simplest question to ask anyone....Should bump stocks be banned if not why not?
#GunSense
#GunControl
6862 2018-02-16 10:52:18 Bump stocks, since they make a rifle effectively automatic, should be regulated via NFA.

"Silencers" are suppressors, and on rifles, only reduce noise by ~30 dB, so down to 120-130 dB.  Still extremely loud.

Banning armor piercing ammo would have no practical benefit.

6907 2018-02-16 10:07:51 The cause(s) of the implosion might be arguable (in some quarters). What's certain is that it again confirms for many that stocks are just too risky, so they'll stick with banks and CD's, whose ROI will compete with stocks on the 32nd of Never.
6908 2018-02-16 10:06:26 And the funny thing is right after the las head shooting congress voted on the ban of bump stocks and they couldn’t even get THAT passed, so yeah, America has some serious gun issues

6948 2018-02-16 09:39:03 There is certainly merit in getting set in 5-10 stocks and waiting. Only need 1-2 to multi bag to provide a very generous yearly wage. Any more is a bonus.
6949 2018-02-16 09:38:48 I suspect the £40,000 could be impact of exit fee and other charges.
6950 2018-02-16 09:37:27 Yes but unlikely an investment would lose £40,000 in a few months with L&G, for example?
6951 2018-02-16 09:36:22 Many reasons:
Lightweight 
Modifications, scopes,stocks,etc
Durable, great camp gun
Small caliber ammo, cheeper
Low recoil, fav of women 
Small game hunting
They are lethal, but not as lethal as large caliber hunting rounds. They do look high tech. Simply a simi- auto rifle.

6957 2018-02-16 09:34:16 Just because an AR15 looks militaristic doesn’t mean it is. Bump fire stocks should be illegal, any means to make a weapon fire fully automatic or anything faster then semi shouldn’t be allowed. But the AR15 stock to a civilian isn’t any more dangerous then a hand gun

6982 2018-02-16 09:14:45 the logical response is: vastly improve gun license standards, stop selling assault rifles at all, grandfather in everyone who has them already, make bump stocks illegal, and...That's it. The 2nd amendment was for a time of muskets and single-fire pistols.

7001 2018-02-16 08:59:42 The Las Vegas shooter chose his target event. He scouted the hotel beforehand. He set up cameras outside his room to alert him of people outside his door.

7003 2018-02-16 08:57:59 Vol is an effect of falling stocks. It doesn’t cause it. Rates caused this correction and the fed stepped in on the long end of the curve to buoy risk assets

7041 2018-02-16 08:26:28 I'm from the US south. So many friends and family voted for Trump. My mother and I barely speak anymore. I was on the phone with her as I was printing out the unemployment form in case the shutdown went long and she said "I love Trump. I made so much money on stocks last year" :(
7042 2018-02-16 08:23:42 Good point. ALL THE MORE REASON TO BAN ALL ASSAULT RIFLES, BUMP STOCKS, LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMO FOR THOSE TYPES OF GUNS!!!
7043 2018-02-16 08:23:33 Maybe we could ban the sale of AR 15s, toughen background checks, buml stocks, etc. Do something. See.ed to work in Australia.
7044 2018-02-16 08:23:12 @RichLowry The 2nd amendment was a CHANGE to the Constitution so it’s inherently a change. This means that it can be changed. It’s called logic. That said, no one is calling for banning guns. Bump stocks ok? It’s called “sensible” reform. @joanwalsh @donlemon DUI is a crime too.

7050 2018-02-16 08:20:31 Yes, but in previous scams, if near endless stream of bank-scam money was used to keep bidding up stocks, then it was 2 scams.  Though it may have gotten labeled just a stk mkt scam. Eg. A cement co in 1992. Was a kid then so dunno exact chronology of events

7056 2018-02-16 08:17:22 It is a multi-faceted problem.  Gun control laws, bans on semi-auto assault weapons, bans on bump stocks, and high capacity magazines, mental health evaluations for all wanting to own a gun, public awareness campaigns, mental health rules, etc.
7057 2018-02-16 08:16:24 Warren Buffet– “ You should buy stocks in the way you buy grocery… not in the way you buy perfumes" #WarrenBuffettFan @WarrenBuffett
7058 2018-02-16 08:15:17 I can’t imagine the benefit of civilians owning semi-automatic or automatic rifles. And those bump stocks are just as bad, if not worse. They should be illegal.
7059 2018-02-16 08:15:15 I agree, but in ordered to understand the whole problem that is Amtrak, requires history check. Supreme Court ruled Amtrak is more like a government entity than a private business, since the gov. owns almost all its stocks. All while taxpayers pay its subsidies.

7062 2018-02-16 08:14:53 Bump stocks are illegal.
7063 2018-02-16 08:14:43 Semi-auto assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines should be illegal.  End of story.

7074 2018-02-16 08:10:27 "Bring intelligence to the debate"?
Seriously? The distinction is simply assault rifles can go from semi to fully automatic. 
Bump stocks pretty much take a semi to close enough to full to make the matter one of semantics. 
Damn sure isn't bringing "intelligence" to the debate.
7075 2018-02-16 08:10:07 Exactly. Repeal the block on gun maker liability for wantonly careless manufacturering, marketing & design. Universal background checks, no assualt weapons, no large capacity clips, no bump stocks. With mandatory training & insurance gun orgs could make a ton of $.

7081 2018-02-16 08:08:11 The common sense gun laws should be that any gun should have a check for anyone that has a mental issue in there background. That's common sense. Banning guns or Banning particular things like bump stocks aren't what's going to do it. Banning guns is like bringing Hitler back
7082 2018-02-16 08:07:33 Im not immune to facts, nor am I callous. Those children lives were taken by a murderous, calculating, freak intent on killing, not a gun. You cant emotionally blackmail the facts away. Bump stocks are not part of the AR15. Someone this calculating will kill irrespective.

7084 2018-02-16 08:06:10 Teachers want to teach. We don’t want to carry guns to school. There was an armed guard. It did NO good.None. We need meta detectors, mental health funding and outlaw bump stocks and semi-Automatics like th AR-15. These help to kill kids faster.
7085 2018-02-16 08:06:04 Your side doesn't even want to band Bump Stocks. Your side wants silencers to be sold to the public. Your side supports the NRA. Your side is fine with gun companies marketing guns to children. Your side IS the enemy.
7086 2018-02-16 08:05:23 Sadly, you need more. I'd say $400K. a) 20% down is weak. 25-30% is common. b) The study considers $300K as a full-cash income. But 1/3 or 1/2 of total income is usually from stock bonuses. Lenders are very conservative on stocks as stable income. Your loan is quite limited.

7092 2018-02-16 08:02:02 Because scam was in stealing money from banks. Real scam was how they got the money not so much in buying stocks (although it is never all or none).

7121 2018-02-16 07:40:40 The real funny thing is bump stocks are stupid and ineffective and reproducible using a stick and a loose grip.  Properly aimed fire is far more deadly then spray and pray .There is a reason our military shifted away from every soldier having full auto weapons.

7123 2018-02-16 07:38:58 Fully are banned but semi arent, however its ez to modify to make full.  Nra doesnt seem to want bump stocks banned or they would be. Cornyn started after vegas then dropped it.  It is complex but lots of ways to improve things.
7124 2018-02-16 07:38:34 And we ban semi autos again, along with bump stocks, large mags, make domestic violence and any other violent crime a permanent red flag. We have to stop over thinking some of this & do it.
7125 2018-02-16 07:38:25 Close.... I have a much better idea.

Everyone who VISITS the Senate and House of Representatives should be issued an AR-15, modified with bump stocks, and 3 fully loaded hundred clip magazines, to walk around with... 

That will keep the place safe from bad guys with guns.
7126 2018-02-16 07:38:07 That was just a quick one that I looked up earlier for someone else. Not in the mood to put together a statistic packet on a never ending debate.

7137 2018-02-16 07:33:50 Yes it’s mental illness but it’s guns too. It’s not an either/or situation. Bump Stocks and Semi-automatics should be outlawed. They ONLY help people kill more children in a shorter amount of time.

7152 2018-02-16 07:19:53 What about bump stocks? They were pretty effective in Vegas. We all should get some of those just in case Trump decides to attack us with our own military.

7157 2018-02-16 07:15:41 We have been saying it for years. Assault weapons ban. Ban bump stocks. End Citizens United. End Dark Money. Campaign finance reform. Problem is these policies are THE reason the current congress is in power.
7158 2018-02-16 07:15:17 Enough of the GOPS "thoughts & prayers" DO SOMETHING to address the problem of gun violence in our country!  STOP taking $ from the NRA & gun lobbyists! Until you do - you have blood on your hands and your thoughts and prayers are hollow! Bump Stocks are STILL Legal BTW. #ENOUGH

7164 2018-02-16 07:10:25 The bump stocks he purchased were perfectly legal, as were the weapons he purchased. Again, nobody is ignoring the mental health problem in this country, but you damn sure are in denial about the gun problem
7165 2018-02-16 07:09:07 The point was that people find elsewhere to blame. He could have easily ran over 10 people in a car.... more cases on that. Said it before, EMOTIONS got the best of him. MONEY HATE and GREED are the catalyst behind crap like this.
7166 2018-02-16 07:08:29 With multiplying data usage limits (4.5 X for almost just 12.5% more) telecom companies stocks are definitely headed downwards in 12 - 24 months. More integrated players like Airtel will be most likely to survive but likely going to lose a lot to survive.  (1/3)
7167 2018-02-16 07:08:08 Guns are practically free right now. I follow gun manufacturer stocks and all are doing very poorly since trump got elected. People buy fewer guns when the risk of further regulations is low. Interesting to see what happens.
7168 2018-02-16 07:07:26 How many months since Las Vegas shooting? Still gathering the facts in order to ban bump stocks??

7173 2018-02-16 07:04:37 Like I said I keep my guns locked in a biometric safe. I wouldn’t be opposed to legislation to keep them secure at home but depends on how it was written and what Dems would try to add to it. Just like what they did with bump stocks.
7174 2018-02-16 07:02:08 The NRA will pretend to care for a couple days after they deem it acceptable to “politicize tragedy,” just like they did after Vegas with bump stocks, before going back to business as usual when the dust settles and no meaningful change occurs. They don’t care
7175 2018-02-16 07:00:05 @DavidNdii your argument is so one sided. The next crisis wont be a currency crisis though, itll just be other ponzi's like housing and stocks, the currency will be printed into oblivion before it fails which is good news for bitcoin remaining to weather that storm.

7180 2018-02-16 06:56:28 Start w/ state laws that prohibit persons outside of active duty military or LEOs from possessing, using, owning, or purchasing automatic weapons, high capacity magazines, or bump stocks.
7181 2018-02-16 06:56:20 @SpeakerRyan From a moral standpoint you are a mass murderer.  You have made it easier for mentally ill people to get assault weapons.  You have refused to ban bump stocks.  You have refused to ban assault weapons. The blood is on your hands.  You are the personification of EVIL.
7182 2018-02-16 06:56:16 bump stocks are irrelevant.most mass shootings have not used them.
7183 2018-02-16 06:56:09 Look at what’s been happening with police shootings.  America is already a powder keg as it is.  Maybe try getting rid of the AR 15, outlawing bump stocks, the mass shooter’s readily accessible military style weapon of choice.

7190 2018-02-16 06:52:47 I would like to have him describe the reasons that the people were killed and why in person to the parents of the murdered!! I am not anti gun I am very angry that bump stocks are still able to be obtained beyondhave besides the military personnel.
7191 2018-02-16 06:51:09 I'm not naive enough to believe that. The NRA backed politicians refused to even stop bump stocks after Vegas. On the no-fly list? Nothing. Mental health problems? Nothing. Trump literally ended a plan to restrict ppl who need help managing their own disability income.
7192 2018-02-16 06:51:02 .@TomiLahren And the families don't want pointless platitudes. The survivors themselves are calling for #SensibleGunReformNOW. Ban semi-automatics. Ban bump stocks. Flag mentally ill and bar from gun purchases.
7193 2018-02-16 06:50:32 This is a silly measure which is not only not based on facts, it won’t solve anything meaningful.

My guess is approximately 0.

7201 2018-02-16 06:46:17 Cut the disingenuous crap. Both are bad. As was Trump rescinding, on February 28th, 2017, Obama's bill to stop mentally ill persons buying guns. Now we have a pool of 75,000 MORE  mentally ill people, who can, like the Parkland shooter, buy guns, ammo, clips, bump stocks, etc.
7202 2018-02-16 06:45:51 2 years earlier he'd legalized fully automatic bump stocks, as used by the Vegas shooter....AND Uranium 1.
7203 2018-02-16 06:45:03 First, every school in the country must be heavily armed with police or military contractors. 
Second, guns like AR-15 should be subject to some form of background check but no prohibition. 
Third, bump stocks or whatever should be banned except for medical necessity.
7204 2018-02-16 06:44:53 We should ban ALL of these types of assault weapons AR15, AK47 and any other similar gun and multiple shot magazines and bum stocks. Only single shot handguns should be allowed and after a thorough background check of everything including your firstborn and privates.
7205 2018-02-16 06:44:28 Only if you have bump stocks AR-15'S ETC. If you can't use a pistol or rifle or shotgun you don't need to have a gun.

7207 2018-02-16 06:43:55 We shouldn't make it easy to get weapons that are only designed to kill people. Assault weapons, high capacity clips, bump stocks, etc.should be illegal. At least it would be harder to get. Maybe some wouldn't bother. Maybe some would be caught in the process. #EnoughIsEnough

7209 2018-02-16 06:43:09 And you made some good points just now, bump stocks are a blatant disregard for regulation, suppressors are less effective than you would think, we need more socio-psychological research to see what the driving force in the influx of mass shootings are

What if?

7228 2018-02-16 06:34:33 Banning bump stocks is really the only one that will consistently get large support, but like almost all the others, it will have no effect on gun violence. Universal background checks get broad support in theory, but in specifics, people often recoil. 2/
7229 2018-02-16 06:34:10 @realDonaldTrump @chuckschumer The GOP Party is now the NRA Party.  It's not taking away the 2nd Amendment if you allow those who have guns be able to keep them, but prohibit Gun Stocks and AR-15 being sold.

7231 2018-02-16 06:32:14 Why are bump stocks even legal.
7232 2018-02-16 06:31:49 I actually have no problem with banning bump stocks.
No matter what little technicalities that advocates of them claim, they obviously turn a semi-automatic into an automatic.
7233 2018-02-16 06:31:44 If no one has the guts to ban assault style weapons, how about we:

- impose a 50 cent tax on each and every bullet sold. Use money to help improve school safety
- ban large magazines so they reload more often.
- ban bump stocks so hundreds can't get mowed down like in Vegas.
7234 2018-02-16 06:31:11 No bump stocks have not been addressed. In fact legislation was proposed but nothing happened. The point being these guns can still be easily adapted to rapid fire.

Theres your fix dear. Youre looking in the wrong direction, as they want you too. Dont be a sheep. THINK!
7240 2018-02-16 06:28:53 All Ryan need to do is to secure all the schools with metal detectors, have police standing outside school doors to no one with a gun can enter, and have police walking the hallways.  Or take guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and ban AR-15 assault rifles and bump stocks.

7246 2018-02-16 06:26:53 It says the bill to end bump stocks was predictably stuffed with other bans and therefore failed.
7247 2018-02-16 06:26:23 But absolutely NOT 300 million GUN OWNERS. And it's not giving up GUNS. Stop being hysterical. Bump stocks are used to KILL. They are not guns, enhance rapid kill rate. Semi-Automatics are used for killing multiple people quickly. THAT'S NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE.
7248 2018-02-16 06:24:19 South African stocks index rose as much as 5% yesterday; the main indexes biggest one-day gain in more than three years. Banking index notably gaining the most, Nedbank rising 5.37% and rival FirstRand up 6.4%.

7251 2018-02-16 06:22:29 And who ever said AR15s are the only issue? Guess what, so are C mags, so are bump stocks, all that shit needs to go. Yes assault rifle are already illegal but apparently that isn’t enough cause kids are still getting shot for no reason way too often.
7252 2018-02-16 06:22:21 Ban automatics and bump stocks.  Done right there.
7253 2018-02-16 06:22:06 Probably because of times like when the GOP proposed banning bump stocks after the Vegas shooting but Dems tried to go even further and the legislation got nowhere.  That should have been an easy vote.
7254 2018-02-16 06:21:13 Now do the Obama Admin approving bump stocks over the objection of the NRA. He and all his supporters have the blood of Las Vegas, and and every child gassed in Syria.

7262 2018-02-16 06:15:59 Too bad I didn’t have extra cash lying around to buy more stocks at last weeks sell off. I could’ve profited big time by now.
7263 2018-02-16 06:15:39 @GeoffCutmore @cnbcKaren Goodmorning i think both of you are right ! bond tells us reality and Stocks tells us future expectation and still no bad news coming despite everybody is a little bit cautious !
7264 2018-02-16 06:15:31 Then maybe the best fix, or the start to one could be a state ban on assault rifles they find used in high crimes. Im a gun responsible gun owner. Even i agree bump stocks ans assault rifles should be banned. But congress wont fix it. I do my part by not purchasin one. Its on us

7275 2018-02-16 06:07:31 "Assault rifle" was what the politicians used in the initial ban.
Strictly militarily speaking, because an AR-15 is not "selective fire", capable of automatic fire, it's not technically an assault rifle. 
For practical purposes, bump stocks took care of that.
Bullshit semantics.

We need need to ban bump stocks, I’m by no means saying get rid of all guns, just have regulation.

7297 2018-02-16 05:57:39 I don’t think guns should be banned, but hi capacity clips, bump stocks and now silencers serve no purpose. Imagine Cruz with a silencer. Only people witnessing someone being shot would know what’s going on. 10 feet away, in a crowd.......... No clue.

7302 2018-02-16 05:53:58 And yet bump stocks are completely legal.
7303 2018-02-16 05:53:56 So make bump stocks illegal, like the Vegas shooter used that pretty much turned his AR into a fully automatic weapon. Oh wait, the NRA lobbies against that because owning an attachment that makes your gun a murder machine cuts into their profits.
7304 2018-02-16 05:53:53 And bump stocks are still legal.

7314 2018-02-16 05:50:20 They did a good job of promoting and boosting sales of deadly bump stocks as well.

7316 2018-02-16 05:47:59 Today only software stocks are moving.Overall breath of market is very bad.
7317 2018-02-16 05:47:22 Ok.  It's properly called an "assault weapon" not an assault rifle because our didn't have selective fire.

But who really gives a rats ass either way?  

The more important thing is went are they being sold without any background checks with 100 round magazines and bump stocks?
7318 2018-02-16 05:46:46 That's simply NOT true. My family shoot. They had to surrender weapons but still own rifles and handguns. They're kept securely. Shooting is for hunting or on a range not for picking off children. My family still own guns just not automatic weapons, silencers, bump stocks.
7319 2018-02-16 05:45:23 Why isn’t it the shooter’s fault? Apparently HE made a horrible decision. Why do people find ways to point the finger elsewhere? Why not blame him, his parents, or his upbringing...
7320 2018-02-16 05:45:07 ...I believe bump stocks were one of the main reasons for that increase. 59 deaths and the next one down the list is V-tech with 33. Even the NRA agrees bump stocks should be regulated but there has been no federal law passed yet.

7329 2018-02-16 05:42:57 We’ve always had guns, but not bump stocks, high capacity mags, armor-piercing rounds, semi-automatics, laser sights. C’mon @gopTODD, America is not appreciably more mentally ill than in the past, but the lethality and availability of non-hunting related firearms has skyrocketed.
7330 2018-02-16 05:42:55 How about banning a given kind of gun; AR-15 for example?
Limiting magazine volume.
Banning bump fire stocks.
Requiring guns be disassembled and locked in a safe.
Prohibiting some from owning guns because of meds they're on etc.
7331 2018-02-16 05:42:41 It's way harder to build a pipe bomb than pull a trigger, so I'm all for that. It would cut deaths way down. Majority of the time, they even fail to detonate or the bomber gets killed. So please go ahead. Ban AR-15s and bump stocks, etc. Go back to muskets. 
7332 2018-02-16 05:42:22 No. We need to regulate caliber and the amount of gun powder in the rounds if people want guns like this, and there is no way bump stocks should be legal. The laws need to be simplified and manufactures need to be held accountable.
7333 2018-02-16 05:42:18 Something seems to finally have been enough this time in #Parkland.
After 6-8 yr olds being shot didn't do it.

After 100 people shot (58 killed) in LV didn't do it & couldn't even get congress to ban bump stocks.
7334 2018-02-16 05:41:58 Bump stocks. Semi auto is military grade too(correct me if I'm wrong) just not an "assault rifle"

7341 2018-02-16 05:38:41 I agree with bump stocks except in military/police training. I don’t agree with treating guns like cars, because cars are a privilege but self defense under the 2nd amndmnt is a right. The government shouldn’t be able to restrict the average citizen from self protection
7342 2018-02-16 05:38:02 This is ridiculous I am getting in arguments with people who think bump stocks should still be used in non military training!! WHY Not!!!
7343 2018-02-16 05:37:14 Great ideas! In Seattle they have a 21 cent tax per ounce on Soda. I don’t think it would be too hard to put a high tax on guns, ammo, peripherals like bump stocks & silencers. The insurance policy is also genius. If gun owners want to kill things, let them pay for consequences.
7344 2018-02-16 05:37:09 Seeking answers, supporting research,not blocking same, and as mortified as ‘decent people’ to find creative ways of reducing and ending gun violence. They want MORE at 15s, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. PURE insanity.

7351 2018-02-16 05:32:32 Guns are fine. Many people have guns. Gun regulation advocates have guns. There is NO reason for bump stocks and no reason for semi automatics. They need to be outlawed. Stop being extreme.
7352 2018-02-16 05:32:17 No, Steve.  We have prayed enough.  It’s time for action.  There is no reason anyone needs a clip of anything larger than 30, and bump stocks should have already been made illegal but Republicans killed that bill in Committee.  Do this after you pass DACA tomorrow.
7353 2018-02-16 05:32:03 I never thought you were stupid. When gun owners are content they are not in a rush to go out and buy gun's, but when there's a reason for more gun control laws then there's a rush to buy more guns and drives up the stocks.

7357 2018-02-16 05:31:01 Your words are just air. You couldn’t even manage to ban bump stocks after Vegas. You are truly impotent and submissive to your benefactor, the NRA. So maybe save your hearts and prayers; you’ll need them next election. All kids deserve better.

7372 2018-02-16 05:23:37 Also bump stocks were already illegal in NJ.  Any adjustable stock on a semi auto is illegal therefore it was illegal.  That does nothing as you can buy one legally in PA.  You can also make one fairly easy.

7381 2018-02-16 05:21:22 Aso, Pizza Boy, when the Russians are invading America? Oh, no, they are already in the White House.
So, a Glock 40 isn't enough to "defend" your family? A Mosberg? Why the fuck you need a damn AR-15 with bump-stocks????
7382 2018-02-16 05:21:15 I feel like such a grown up discussing stocks & investments and getting excited with @tonichaelmight
7383 2018-02-16 05:20:43 ‘Bumper’ stocks? 
7384 2018-02-16 05:20:35 At the VERY LEAST:
Increased background checks
Watchlist for people with violent offenses on their record.

Best case at this point would be a ban or buyback on assault weapons like AR15 and ban on bump stocks.
7385 2018-02-16 05:19:40 He never talks his favorite stocks or sectors....!!!  Even I am bullish on equity along with him, but when you're expressing views , give Investors some good ideas atleast...@_soniashenoy @porinju

7388 2018-02-16 05:19:17 Im glad you have specifics in mind. Most of then I agree with. Guns are a complex issue my friend. Fully automatics should be banned. Even the NRA wants bump stocks banned.

7390 2018-02-16 05:19:03 Cancer TREATMENT is a multi-billion dollar industry. An actual cure would crash the stocks of several Fortune 500 companies.
7391 2018-02-16 05:18:57 How many stocks are democrats invested in? Hype BS.
7392 2018-02-16 05:18:18 Everyone needs to look & see if their House & Sen reps voted to gut the ADA today & if they did, they need to be voted out in Nov. Donate to their opponent & VOTE THEM OUT! They do this kind of crap yet they won't ban bump stocks & assault rifles. #ADA
7393 2018-02-16 05:17:48 I’m rooting for it! So cute!
7394 2018-02-16 05:17:42 My current plan is only to sell this as a print... So I'm not so sure about having a digital release. :( Maybe, I'll reopen it again if I have stocks after the conventions I'm going to. But thank you so much for your support. 
7395 2018-02-16 05:17:38 Easy. Mods that allow for “auto fire” such as bump stocks. Armor piercing or exploding tip bullets. Extended magazines. I don’t have a problem with ARs so to speak. It’s the magazines and the mods that make them unnecessary.
7396 2018-02-16 05:16:10 You should grill him and ask for multibagger stocks
7397 2018-02-16 05:15:56 Ban weapons of war from our communities—AR-15s and all automatic and semiautomatic guns, bump stocks and enhanced bullets.
7398 2018-02-16 05:15:05 Also Politicians, What is the purpose for having bump stocks on the market? PLEASE get rid of these damn devices (bump stocks) that have helped kill so many people. Very sad times we live in, so we need action from our politicians. #Parkland #GunReformNow
7399 2018-02-16 05:14:19 FYI - Porinju has exited all future group stocks @porinju on CNBC
7400 2018-02-16 05:14:02 Speaker Ryan also said the issue of bunt stocks would be addressed. As long as NRA can buy our legislators we’ll have more innocent Americans killed in masses.
7401 2018-02-16 05:13:56 It's the end of a long week of reporting. We finish with $MPL on track, healthcare stocks $HSO and $PRY continuing their recovery and some disappointing numbers from miners $NCM and $S32. Next week will be big with 75 ASX 200 companies reporting including $BHP, $WES and $QAN.
7402 2018-02-16 05:13:33 1. Ban bump stocks. 2. Ban armor-piercing bullets. 3. Ban high capacity magazines. 4. Make people purchase insurance for guns. 5. Establish a proficiency test. 6. Let CDC research gun violence. 7. AR-15s only at gun ranges.
7403 2018-02-16 05:13:16 Relationships are equal to stocks and bonds #investments
7404 2018-02-16 05:12:59 Sir , what bases you highlited red for few among all gap up stocks
7405 2018-02-16 05:12:53 If you want to more strictly regulate things that actually make a weapon more effective. I’m mostly fine with that. But things like bump stocks and silencers don’t really do anything.
7406 2018-02-16 05:12:34 oh, sammy, I found this for you:

"Stocks were up Thursday for American Outdoor Brands, the company that makes the AR-15 rifle used in the Florida school shooting that claimed 17 lives."
7407 2018-02-16 05:12:21 Congress needs to do something! Ban the AR-15! it's been used in every mass shooting since columbine! Ban bump stocks! I have no problem with the 2nd amendment but there is no reason a citizen should have an AR-15 assault military style rifle!!!
7408 2018-02-16 05:12:20 I thought the kids on #CbsEveningNews were clear.  BOTH parties need to shut the f up & DO something.  Now.  Like today.   No assault weapons.  No clinically depressed peo0le with guns.  No bump stocks.  Now.
7409 2018-02-16 05:12:09 Totally.  Collapsible stocks, high capacity external magazines, short barrels.  Totally the same thing as your daddy’s bolt gun.
7410 2018-02-16 05:12:08 @flipkartsupport @Flipkart absolutely disgusted with your website. Trying to buy MI from sale but site just hangs. By the time i refreshed stocks vanished...pathetic is the least of the word to be used.
7411 2018-02-16 05:11:04 Well see how it goes. History does not give me high hopes but I like him so far
7412 2018-02-16 05:10:54 Not to mention makeshift bump fire stocks. Theres just no point. It wont help.
7413 2018-02-16 05:10:32 Yes. We must be willing to assert/support ALL reasonable measures and REGULATIONS, i.e. mandatory universal background checks, licenses, barring sales to violent criminals, ban on assault weapons, bump stocks, silencers, etc. NONE OF THESE MEASURES SHOULD BE HARD.
7414 2018-02-16 05:09:21 Most of stocks are in no trade zone..
Seems trap been made by operator to trap  today as bulls are completely missing!
7415 2018-02-16 05:09:15 I wish someone would put in that much effort! Go him! Go you! We won’t mention my history haha
7416 2018-02-16 05:08:54 Bump stocks have been used ....wait for it....once.
7417 2018-02-16 05:08:28 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Institute a 14 year waiting period for all white males to purchase any guns. Require NRA members to personally provide protection for every school in USA. Institute campaign finance reform so big money doesn't get to buy influence.
7418 2018-02-16 05:08:23 What about the ban on bumper stocks after the Vegas shooting? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
7419 2018-02-16 05:07:37 Argument isn't to ban guns. But all would agree line has to be somewhere. Sure u wouldn't support ownership of ballistic missiles.   Argument is line should be drawn with semi-automatic guns & bump-stocks not allowed for civilians.

7422 2018-02-16 05:06:25 Sorry LeBron, check out the economy, stocks and tax bill. Try opening your eyes and do a little investigating beyond just following fake news and opinions of people that have an ax to grind. If you don't stand for something, u fall for anything.
7423 2018-02-16 05:06:23 Yes, absolutely. I don't understand what relevance your tweet had to one about gun stocks rising.
7424 2018-02-16 05:05:45 Will check, but i think the way marketsmojo is increasing user experience and providing data this product have a long way to go. I liked the email after results for stocks in ones portfolio.
7425 2018-02-16 05:04:22 My 30% belief is market may bounce from current levels to 11700 & 70% belief is market may test 9900-10000 on nifty. Phir bhi bought some MOIL, PRAKASH, V2 RETAIL, DELTA CORP, AJMERA REALTY as these are stocks am gonna hold for long term even if comes down.
7426 2018-02-16 05:03:43 Oh.  You can do that with shuriken to push him low enough that he can't side B, or push back the illusion with hydro pump.  It's not too hard, I probably make it happen 15-20% of all stocks which is fairly common
7427 2018-02-16 05:03:34 The media has “decided” no such thing. Normal people have decided that access to assault rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and the such are the reasons for so many mass killings in America, and they want something done about it. Because they are normal.
7428 2018-02-16 05:02:56 Start with bumper stocks.  Get some momentum going.  That should be something even an I dot like you can understand.
7429 2018-02-16 05:02:08 AR is a kind of blanket term. But it's closest modern military comparison by structure is an M4. Relevant to note the differences are more than just rounds per second. Stocks increase rps, but not to full-auto capacity.

*not a political note at all.
7430 2018-02-16 05:01:32 Write some common sense laws with teeth and clarity...#BanAR15s for a start...outlaw bump stocks and flash reducing muzzles...silencers and gun parts should also be regulated so there  is no more "do it urself"  automatic weapons market....
7431 2018-02-16 05:00:28 I'll trade you a ban on AR15's and bump stocks for an abortion ban.  That's 1.21 million abortions in the US this year.  I'll even throw in abortion allowed for medical risk to life of the mother, rape & incest and terminal deformity of the fetus. Deal?
7432 2018-02-16 05:00:03 There is no one answer solution to such a complex problem. It’s the logical, rational start. Banning assault rifles isn’t banning all guns, it’s banning the ones that enable mass shootings. There is also no great reason to keep bump stocks and silencers.
7433 2018-02-16 04:59:17 Un true the NRA was the first to say that bump stocks need to be looked at again
7434 2018-02-16 04:59:03 Bayonetta 1 + 2 Nintendo Switch version released today. A few stocks available around the stores. I don't know it'll get plenty more stocks in the future or not.
7435 2018-02-16 04:58:46 Michelle Lensink wants to stop the sale of public housing and increase the stocks if Liberal government is formed #sanetfest2018
7436 2018-02-16 04:58:17 Like in the last week of Jan we now see a two day divergence between Midcap indices and Nifty. Do not be surprised by a repeat of the same as stocks that have already bounced retreat and a few index stocks lead the way higher, as world markets continue their retracements.
7437 2018-02-16 04:57:23 If I were active in Indian stocks I think PNB is a buy. #TooBigToFail
7438 2018-02-16 04:56:38 DO NOT compare the Dems to the party that allowed 15 children & 2 adults to be slaughtered last night. In Dec. 2016 @POTUS killed legislation that would have added Mental health info to BC's. After LV @SpeakerRyan refused to vote on NRA, bi-partisan appv ban on Bump Stocks. FACT!
7439 2018-02-16 04:56:13 (1/2) 
Why the Podestas are relevant: 

-The Podesta Group were lobbyists paid by Russia to influence American policy
-John Podesta was Hillary’s campaign manager 
-He sat on the board of a Russian investment firm w/ Kremlin ties 
-He hid his sales of Russian stocks from Congress
7440 2018-02-16 04:56:11 Too early to discuss gun control, again. If it's too early for Parkland maybe we can talk about Sandyhook or Las Vegas. I'm pretty sure not selling AR-15's and bump stocks won't stop the crazy but   if they can't pick it up at Walmart it might slow them down. #NoMoreBloodMoney
7441 2018-02-16 04:55:42 he has exited future group stocks after big gains
7442 2018-02-16 04:55:11 Unless it's a single shot bolt action rifle or most shotguns, just about any gun will be, one trigger pull, one shot. That includes pistols.
We need both better restrictions on those high risk individuals AND getting rid of large cap magazines and bump stocks.
7443 2018-02-16 04:54:45 Can you honestly say youv researchd the issue Are you aware of everyrhing the NRA has blocked may have an impact -, like research to figure out what to do. After vegas, congress didn't even ban bump stocks. All bump stocks do is circumvemt the law & they couldnt even ban those
7444 2018-02-16 04:54:07 It doesn't have any stocks made with mostly shapes
7445 2018-02-16 04:53:51 Ban AR15 rifles and bump stocks permanently! Now!
7446 2018-02-16 04:53:05 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks, get some regulation or at least accountability on social media, figure out how to break the pattern of toxic masculinity in our boys. (That’s the hardest one to figure out, but without it, gun control alone won’t solve it.) How? God, who knows?

7449 2018-02-16 04:51:11 The Second Amendment was written within the historical context of the gun technology of that time. If semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. had been available back then, our framers would not have written the Second Amendment as it currently stands.
7450 2018-02-16 04:51:01 Its everyones fault who thinks its okay 4 the public 2 have AR15s. We don't have militias. These arent muskets. We have a military. They are the only 1s that need them. Period. Keep your guns & shot guns. Do away with bump stocks and AR15s or put our military vets in the schools
7451 2018-02-16 04:50:47 Restrictions or bans of assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks will require FEDERAL legislation.
7452 2018-02-16 04:50:37 You dispicable excuse,waste of humanity. Your flimsy response/ failure to do the right thing time after time. Ban the effing assault weapons, HC cartridges &stocks.
Only you could also defund ADA same day as your inhumane response to this tragedy. True evil resides here-it is you

7456 2018-02-16 04:50:18 Delta 100 and 400 are def my favourite film stocks when it comes to B&W. Process them in TMax dev and it comes out so crisp, even when pushing a couple stops :)
7457 2018-02-16 04:50:13 Employing new workers is additional expense minimising tax on big business mean that it's smartest for them to invest in their stocks
7458 2018-02-16 04:50:09 I repeat. Bump stocks should be banned. Semi automatic &  automatic weapons must be kept at gun ranges. Many are on the street, we get them one at a time. Is going to take a long time. There will still be weapons. Guns, machetes on  Long Island, trucks in Europe, pipe bombs....
7459 2018-02-16 04:50:09 — no bump stocks. No high capacity magazines.  Have to take 6 mos of training for a gun.
7460 2018-02-16 04:49:45 I think staying out from stocks till the march end is the wisest choice for those who doesn't want to take risk. Buy in March 30th we will see a big dip or in April for the new financial year till then accumulate your long term bet . #nse #nifty #india
7461 2018-02-16 04:49:42 Ban all guns. Like tyranny is ever going to happen here. I mean come on. 

In other news, if we find you with raw milk, psilocybin mushrooms, trading stocks too well, or a smile on your face we will hunt you down and ruin your life.
7462 2018-02-16 04:49:31 3. make bump stocks illegal.
4. require military/national guard service for all new purchases of a firearm.
5. forfeiture of gun rights in the case of DUI, Domestic Abuse, Terroristic threats, mental illness, or drug use.
7463 2018-02-16 04:49:00 This is the life of these types of stocks. Anyone here remember one called $THD ? Exactly the same action
7464 2018-02-16 04:48:58 "Congress has similarly failed to act on bump stocks, the mechanism for accelerating the firing speed of semi-automatic rifles used in the Las Vegas shooting
7465 2018-02-16 04:48:43 You also cant touch stocks other than what a piece of paper says you own. You can walk into a store and use your Google shares to buy milk at the cash register. Does that mean the stocks are worthless? No.
7466 2018-02-16 04:48:36 One has fight including chem trails stocks . :) 
7467 2018-02-16 04:48:22 And universal background checks it’s ridiculous @secupp that this kid can get an AR-15 in 20minutes and has to wait for a handgun for 3days. Also we need a voluntary annual gun buyback program. It wouldn’t hurt. Bump stocks, why?
7468 2018-02-16 04:48:17 1. Ban bump stocks. 2. Ban armor-piercing bullets. 3. Ban high capacity magazines. 4. Make people purchase insurance for guns. 5. Establish a proficiency test. 6. Let CDC research gun violence. 7. AR-15s only at gun ranges.
7469 2018-02-16 04:46:31 I’m pro 2A, I have several guns. But there’s no need for massive mags and bump stocks.
7470 2018-02-16 04:46:16 What is the view on frontline pharma stocks like sun pharma etc?
7471 2018-02-16 04:46:07 Yea...I’m about guns but the team that thought making and selling bump-stocks, or the handcrank, to anyone needs to be pistol-whipped, repeatedly.
7472 2018-02-16 04:46:03 So little Marco, why not try at lease to make it hard as you can for the shooters to get their hands on GUNS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. YOU KNOW, BUMP STOCKS 40 rounds in a clip ÀR15s. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. DON'T TRY TO PLAY DUMB.

2. Doesn’t need to be banned but mag capacity limits, actually banning bump stocks (still not been done) or proper and thorough checks
7475 2018-02-16 04:44:36 Ask him what is the future of GVK power, future gp, shiva cements & other small cap stocks
7476 2018-02-16 04:44:26 The AR-15 “style” black rifle that you and I can buy is a semi-automatic .223 caliber. There are plenty of hunting rifles that are .223 but have wooden stocks and look less threatening.  It’s the same rifle though.
7477 2018-02-16 04:44:02 Large magazines don't make sense to you but you don't get to decide what people need and what people want. Bump stocks will be restricted to a class 3 license...no question about that.

7481 2018-02-16 04:42:46 Why dont you guys try 3 stocks? 
7482 2018-02-16 04:42:17 However, my main points were in regards to regulating simple things like bump stocks, requiring more in-depth background checks as well as requiring education, or even innovative stuff like printing gun serials to each shell casing once bullets are shot

3) keep the peach in the pocket fam

don't ban bayo, ban mistake
7484 2018-02-16 04:40:35 Incredible and terrifying to think even modest gun control can’t be passed. Congress has let us all down! Assault weapons? Bump stocks? Large magazines?

7490 2018-02-16 04:40:08 We can’t undo gun culture with ease & alacrity but we need to do something. The gun lobby needs to take efforts to ban bump stocks and fix the background check system. Liberals everywhere want to kill them so they need to compromise to stay alive #GunControl
7491 2018-02-16 04:40:00 Yes, it is the guns. We can have angry and disturbed people behind them, but if they didn’t have the damn rifles or bump stocks to begin with, they wouldn’t be able to use them to kill innocent people. The person fires the gun because they got ahold of a gun they shouldn’t have.
7492 2018-02-16 04:39:12 "How many data points do we have indicating bump stocks contribute to mass shootings" "One" "Good enough."
7493 2018-02-16 04:38:33 @TamiLahren Because of people like you, we can’t get a ban on bump stocks.   And the NRA favors a ban on bump stocks!   

What is wrong with you?
7494 2018-02-16 04:37:45 Uh huh, the “truth.” Let us guess, silencers are for hearing protection and bump stocks are to ease achy trigger fingers?
7495 2018-02-16 04:37:17 Yes yes yes yes yes!!! Vote out all Republicans in the NRA’s pocket out, out out !!! Enact new laws, ban the assault rife, ban the bump stocks, put the bill back in place for restrictions on the mentally ill to buy guns that YOU canceled with your wicked pen.
7496 2018-02-16 04:35:43 Climbing too many bamboo stocks.

7498 2018-02-16 04:35:17 Second, only bad people have all the high powered weaponry, bump stocks, automatic firearms, etc. Here's the irony in this moronic statement: If, say, republicans made abortions illegal, would that stop abortions? (3/3)
7499 2018-02-16 04:34:57 Yea lol pretty much all exchanges have small transfer fees. Only one that doesn't afaik is Robinhood's crypto(they already do stocks) and that will only have bitcoin and ethereum and it isn't even out for public yet.
7500 2018-02-16 04:34:39 @SteveScalise hey what do you think about  conceal carry gun laws, ar-15s and bump stocks? You seem quiet.
7501 2018-02-16 04:34:13 @realDonaldTrump empty words today.  You think that BS you spewed is going to placate? We want background checks on ALL sales, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, required training and insurance and a tax on ammo to fund victims of gun violence. Don't do this, you're out.
7502 2018-02-16 04:33:57 Being an adult with an actual adult job is hard. How am I supposed to know how much to contribute to RRSP? Or company stocks!? ... maybe I should’ve paid attention to those 5 years of business school

7504 2018-02-16 04:33:46 I see similarities between three stocks, all under $60. Holding $mu mar 42c and $amat mar 52.5c/55c spread. I believe $nvda will surpass market cap of $intc within 18 months. LoL
7505 2018-02-16 04:33:29 Ban automatic weapons. Ban conversion kits. Ban bump stocks. For the dead, do something, or shut up and retire for good.
7506 2018-02-16 04:32:48 States don’t need to wait for the Feds, Florida could have strict gun laws this week if they wanted.  I don’t think they banned bump stocks either.
7507 2018-02-16 04:32:20 Typical conservative ; guns don’t kill people, people kill people.  The AR 15 needs to be banned along with Bump Stocks. I don’t understand why automatic weapons of war are permitted in the hands of civilians. This does not in any way impinge upon the 2nd amendment.
7508 2018-02-16 04:31:58 Falling crude prices / US dollar index corrections.....good for EM like India..........

7509 2018-02-16 04:31:56 As a school support staff member, it was hard to go to school today. My team remembered to treat all students with kindness, as we do every day. If only mental health was fully covered & assault rifles & bump stocks banned,with very detailed background checks,and loopholes closed
7510 2018-02-16 04:31:55 Futures aren't a baddesl either, however canabis stocks which are considered penny stocks have a greater return one I know of increased over 20,000% in 3 months
7511 2018-02-16 04:31:36 Ok.  Bump stocks, assault rifles, AR 15 style rifles, rifles that are created to be used in military combat. Any gun that kill like the one that was used in this atrocity.
7512 2018-02-16 04:31:25 Common sense background checks for a start.  Start banning assault rifles and multi round weapons.  If you need a rifle to fire 80 rounds per minute, then you’re not hunting game anymore.
7513 2018-02-16 04:31:15 Stuff like this always makes me question life itself!  Ha!  I'm with you...I just want to pick individual stocks.  The less time I spend thinking (worrying) about macro stuff the better.  But that just can't happen in this wonky world we are in right now...unfortunately!?!
7514 2018-02-16 04:31:12 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Instead of spending any money on a useless wall, use it to buy back people’s guns.
7515 2018-02-16 04:31:05 Then maybe they shouldn't sell assault rifles, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.

7519 2018-02-16 04:29:11 @DonLemon_CNN Gun safety bills in Fla never reach the governor since committee chair never brings the bills up in committee #SB456-bump-fire stocks & #SB 196-gun safety by Sen Stewart & #SB530-risk protection orders by Sen Gibson. Talk about fixing is hollow w/out bills on agenda
7520 2018-02-16 04:27:29 And I didn't attack you. Merely countered the point on the table, such as it is. School shootings. Meh. Senior politician shot in the head in public. Meh.

Non governmental responses would be for media to stop displaying images of the shooter or his name,
7524 2018-02-16 04:25:06 Great identification of good companies. I've been following and investing I these same stocks since early 2017. Correct me if I'm wrong and I would like your input. I feel that based on volume and a few other factors the stocks are going to be stagnate
7525 2018-02-16 04:24:54 Semi-automatic weapons, I believe, should be kept at gun ranges. Bump stocks, should be illegal. People have their semi-automatic stolen. There are many on the streets, can't get them all. We can get them one at a time. Mandatory metal detectors at every school in the country
7526 2018-02-16 04:24:42 Were Bump Stocks outlawed after Vegas...I need to know...please help...

7529 2018-02-16 04:23:12 Meaning... if there's an area in the States where you're not allowed to buy or carry guns, but 20 miles away, across the State Line, you can pick up semi-automatic rifles, bump-stocks  or plasma rifles in the 40-watt range.
7530 2018-02-16 04:23:03 Remember when people thought a strong yen would hurt stocks? Ha Ha
7531 2018-02-16 04:22:48 That's why 90% of the action gun control advocates demand concerns people (background checks, loopholes, mental health restrictions, stricter ownership requirements) not the guns themselves.  Banning assault weapons & bump stocks only goes so far, but also make sense.
7532 2018-02-16 04:22:12 It would be nice if we could agree on some common sense gun laws. How about dropping the political rhetoric and outlaw bumb stocks, raise the minimum age for ownership, improve background checks, and stop calling an AR 15 a hunting rifle.
7533 2018-02-16 04:22:10 Ban these assault weapons & any equipment to modify weapons into assault weapons like bump stocks
7534 2018-02-16 04:21:58 They banned the removable flash hider and collapsible stocks. nothing over 10rd capacity mags. Large portion of rifles and handguns are semi auto and your expertise leads you to think no civilian needs those?

7543 2018-02-16 04:19:29 there isn't a person i know that thinks every weapon is ok - in fact as you know we already have lists of restricted weapons, there isn't a person i know (including many vets) that thinks large clips and bump stocks make any sense.
7544 2018-02-16 04:19:22 I think I will now vote all Republican now on. I used to vote best candidate regardless, but since last elec it has become Ban All Guns vs Leave Guns alone. No one can be reasonable anymore. Post like this lean me in that direction. Bump stocks shouldnt exist. Some limits needed.
7545 2018-02-16 04:19:02 The nra does but care about reasonable. Your nra can't even actuly support bump stocks or not giving the mentaly ill little guns, people who abuse wives, stalkers.. So I will just be happy throwing gun owners in jail. I will be as unreasonable as you.
7546 2018-02-16 04:18:42 And how am I doing that? All I see is Republicans profiting off NRA memberships & increases in the prices of gun manufacturing stocks…

7549 2018-02-16 04:16:57 What are you having a hard time understanding? It has one purpose: to kill lots of people as quickly and precisely as possible. High-capacity magazines and bump stocks, like the one used in Vegas, multiply the carnage significantly.
7550 2018-02-16 04:16:50 In Las Vegas the shooter used bump stocks which are legal to buy and turn a semi-automatic in to a fully automatic weapon, getting around the regulation x
7551 2018-02-16 04:16:50 We need to stop thinking about this problem as requiring one perfect all encompassing solution. You fight this battle on the margins, little by little. You go after the assault riffles, then the bump stocks, the big clips & the modifications. You do what you can, where you can.

7562 2018-02-16 04:11:39 Wait, so the State where the massacre happened with the help of bump stocks did NOT make them illegal?
7563 2018-02-16 04:11:36 3. Cartridge size limits. 
4. Limits on amount of total ammo that can be owned or purchased at one time.
5. Ban on all firearm modifications. No bum stocks, silencers, or other manipulations that increase rate of fire. 
6. Require every gun owner to carry insurance or lose of gun
7564 2018-02-16 04:11:22 As a gun enthusiast and conservative, yes we need new gun laws. There’s small steps (mag caps, bump stocks, etc) that can if nothing else reduce death tolls. And frankly that’s the only kind of moves that will pass

7566 2018-02-16 04:10:52 People have access to highly weaponized machinery like the AR-15 due to #Republicans refusal to pass common sense laws prohibiting the sale of semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks.

7567 2018-02-16 04:10:40 Do nothing for years. Remember the ban on bump stocks? Oh wait, they (Republicans) said they were going to act on that immediately. Where is it? Obviously people of their word. It’s political because politicians aren’t doing their job. Including the pathetic excuse in the WH

7576 2018-02-16 04:07:07 Universal background checks, purchase age 21 for long guns, ban bump stocks. These are pretty easy ones for everyone to agree on.

7578 2018-02-16 04:06:33 Not outlawing arms. Assault riffles, bump stocks, silencers...the sort of weapon that enables you to shoot a larger amount of people in a small amount of time.
7579 2018-02-16 04:06:11 Have they finished the study on bump stocks yet?
7580 2018-02-16 04:06:01 Sorry for the delay, Claire — was at dinner with a buddy. Peiffer’s right. We don’t need bump stocks. I think that was the whole purpose of my thread tonight was to generate a little discussion. I’m not scared of the other side, but will press upon the fact that “gun control”...
7581 2018-02-16 04:05:04 DO SOMETHING. Our communities need mental health services, our schools & children need to be safe, and common sense laws put in place.  People with mental illnesses should NOT be able to get guns.  Bump stocks outlawed.  Mental health services are needed!  DO SOMETHING!

7583 2018-02-16 04:04:08 And,yes, bump stocks should be illegal.
7584 2018-02-16 04:04:03 I could be wrong but I'm not aware of an instance where an AR-15 has been converted to automatic & used in a mass shooting in the US.  Based upon context, I'm sure you know that bump stocks don't do that, but I wanted to ensure I didn't get a hur-duh-dur reply from someone else.
7585 2018-02-16 04:03:13 @nytimes hmmm, Democrats want a ban on bump stocks, auto and semi-auto weapons.  Doesn't sound bi-partisan Mr. paper of record NY Times
7586 2018-02-16 04:02:49 PARTIAL SOLUTION: NATIONWIDE SCHOOL WALK OUT on MARCH 1st...refuse to return until assault weapons & bump stocks are banned, until universal background checks are mandatory, and people that should not have access to weapons R denied. ENOUGH is ENOUGH! ACTION is LOVE!

7589 2018-02-16 04:02:30 You probably just bought stocks in gorditas
7590 2018-02-16 04:02:20 Bump stocks are gimmicks... If someone returns fire that bump stock is not a precise tool. Now with 20k people standing in the open its effective. Keep in mind the motivated /suicide killer finds a way.

7593 2018-02-16 04:00:19 No, I think bump stocks should be illegal.  But they aren't used here.
7594 2018-02-16 04:00:10 Do a straight up vote on bump stocks no add ons just ya or nay start there but she won’t they all play  and add shit into it so nothing gets done PIGS at the trough
7595 2018-02-16 04:00:10 It is illegal but there are loopholes (like bump stocks). I’d make the law an intent law. If your intent was to make an automatic weapon, I’d treat you like I would someone who had an illegal automatic weapon.
7596 2018-02-16 04:00:05 What's wrong with our lawmakers is that they are bought and sold like stocks on the stock market. Republicans are corrupted by the outside money the NRA gives them. the NRA is one of the principal donors to GOP campaigns.
7597 2018-02-16 03:59:55 @RepKevinYoder do you think its okay for kansans to be able to carry handguns and dealers sell bump stocks and AR 15's?
7598 2018-02-16 03:59:49 The most common rationale for a cognitively dissonant stance is “the fear of missing out on the upside” (aka FOMO – fear of missing out). As I think Seth Klarman pointed out long ago, this isn’t really fear at all, but rather greed: James Montier, GMO. #investing #stocks #money
7599 2018-02-16 03:59:31 off the top of my head: ban assault weapons (like they were under Bush till it expired). Ban bump stocks. Age 21 to buy gun. Prohibit mentally ill, domestic violence and terror watch list ppl from buying. Uni background checks, no default if not completed in 3 days (this happens)
7600 2018-02-16 03:59:26 I’m tired of hearings Sen. Murray. We need action and we needed it years ago. No more studies, no more hearings. Ban assault weapons, high cap. magazines, bump stocks, background checks for ALL gun sales & raise age to purchase a gun to 21. No more talking.
7601 2018-02-16 03:59:13 is Congress currently looking to keep bump stocks legal and allow armor piercing ammo?
7602 2018-02-16 03:58:51 The @GOP is full of it. They said they’d do something about bump stocks but did nothing. They claim to care about being careless w/ classified info. We haven’t heard about all the issues with this Admin. They’re hypocrites that only care about American’s big $ donors. Sick.
7603 2018-02-16 03:58:44 Wow I am invested in this love story! I’m rooting for y’all
7604 2018-02-16 03:58:32 And that’s the goal. Don’t punish responsible gun owners so we can preserve their constitutional rights, but things like banning bump stocks, implementing mandatory background checks, and stopping the sale of ASSAULT rifles seem like very reasonable steps
7605 2018-02-16 03:58:30 Sorry guys I don't talk stocks to much anymore. But the want for followers didn't really matter to me. I made my millions. But I will help.
7606 2018-02-16 03:58:12 AR15 stocks have gone up since yesterday. What kind of sick country are we when people rush to invest in weapons of death cuz they work so well.
7607 2018-02-16 03:58:04 AR 15's or other magazine type firearms and bump stocks should not be sold or allowed to be owned by the general public.  I can see our military and police officers having them. 

STOP SELLING THEM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

YOU ARE KILLING OUR CHILDREN.


7608 2018-02-16 03:57:31 Outlaw assault style rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, purchase of large amounts of ammunition, suppressors and make strict requirements and accountability for gun ownership. Also no cross state permissions for conceal carry. Done.

7614 2018-02-16 03:54:33 Amazing , now EPF limit is being raised to 25%. This is just bullshit. Who the hell is advising Modi. What happens when market tanks, most Indians don't invest in stocks and cannot take such volatility.
7615 2018-02-16 03:54:14 Many Asian markets are shut for the Lunar New Year holiday on Friday,
including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam.

Overnight, U.S. stocks extended their winning streak to five days.
7616 2018-02-16 03:53:53 . . . yet no deaths from bump stocks since!
7617 2018-02-16 03:53:45 is Congress currently looking to keep bump stocks legal and allow armor piercing ammo?
7618 2018-02-16 03:53:32 This is the timeline:
Mass shooting — Gun stocks rise — NRA donates to Republicans in office to keep them silent

With the presidency, house and senate all controlled by the GOP, there will be no change because of Parkland
7619 2018-02-16 03:53:28 Yeah I crawled back some losses but it would be nice to actually make some more cash! Think we go below 268? Back to retest or no? Lots of stocks look to have broken out today but I don’t trust it
7620 2018-02-16 03:53:22 Shut up, Turtle. Until you are willing to make it harder to get a gun, ban bump stocks, and ban AR-15s, you aren’t good for anything except blowing the NRA.
7621 2018-02-16 03:53:12 Velcro stocks....lmao
7622 2018-02-16 03:52:59 Saving to start investing in stocks!
7623 2018-02-16 03:52:21 Select fire is used in some competitions lol. Bump fire can be achieved without the stocks anyway. 
7624 2018-02-16 03:52:12 So what about Vegas?  Paddock was on no radar, but that shooting is not a cause for gun control.  You cant even vote to outlaw bump stocks!  You are owned by the NRA.  They will feed you their agenda(more guns, bullets in both directions, 2nd amendment etc.)and u will proselytize
7625 2018-02-16 03:51:58 no, not talking about stocks, jewellery. maybe then one can afford them
7626 2018-02-16 03:51:55 Reached 10k already according to the stocks and @CoinMarketCap
7627 2018-02-16 03:51:46 If it’s demanding reinstate #AssaultWeaponsBan including bump stocks, magazines & other “accessories” of mass destruction I’m in—if no specifics it’s a waste of time.
7628 2018-02-16 03:51:40 1.  Ban automatic and semi-automatic weapons.
2.  Fully fund the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
3.  Prohibit gun purchases by minors, those on the do not fly list, and anyone convicted of domestic abuse.
4.  Ban bump stocks
7629 2018-02-16 03:51:29 Well, I have no knowledge of guns or bump stocks nor does basically anyone I know. I googled competitions that use bump stocks and nothing came up. Perhaps you can enlighten me.
7630 2018-02-16 03:51:19 Global cues positive........Indian markets under-performance likely to end.....
Time for midcap stocks to catch-up.
7631 2018-02-16 03:51:12 We can’t take steps forward as long as the NRA owns congress.

Something as simple as banning bump stocks was a non-starter.  That would have been a little tiny baby step forward.  But we have cowards on the hill.
7632 2018-02-16 03:51:04 Wtf? Are you seriously suggesting that the sheriff here in my home town is lying and that he didn't use bump fire stocks?
7633 2018-02-16 03:51:00 lol because bump stocks, assault rifles and 100 round drums are definitely what they were referring to. I'm a gun owner, the public needs guns, we do not need military style weapons.

7635 2018-02-16 03:49:58 I would also make it illegal to modify a gun in any way that makes it more like an automatic weapon or allows it to hold more rounds. Or to use things like bump stocks effectively do the same thing.
7636 2018-02-16 03:49:40 Yes, they would rather give people access to assault weapons, bump stocks, etc. , an opportunty to mass murder people, and/or have “fun” killing animals.  Is this something important to preserve? Shouldn’t protecting our children take precedent? How can it even be a debate?
7637 2018-02-16 03:49:24 There are a lot of different ways do define assault weapons, the most common being semi auto rifles with the ability to attach detachable magazines and modifiable stocks. Defining them is the easy part, the hard part would be taking them away. I know Australia has success in
7638 2018-02-16 03:49:24 In other words, shut up and wait for people to forget about it.

“Remember the bump stocks? Neither do we!” - @GOP, @SpeakerRyan 

Vote them out, America! Common sense must return! They won’t change, they won’t listen, they must go.
7639 2018-02-16 03:49:22 Should perform with stock market if stocks go higher which i doubt next week. Restrain yourself from robot buying & getting caught following short term price. Stock market is small in comparison to amount of $ in dollar & bonds so since those cant get bid, stocks rally is fake!
