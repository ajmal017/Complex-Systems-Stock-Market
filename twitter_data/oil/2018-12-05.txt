2 2018-12-05 23:59:52 So... what is that worth? We bought oil from murderers? Murderers fly our Astronauts to the Space Station. Now you want to get sanctimonious with the only Middle Eastern Ally who can help with Iran? After all the BS we see in the world and we do business, why are you worried now
3 2018-12-05 23:59:45 buuut u can thank big oil/gas companies for effectively shutting this r&d sector of the big 3 brands down.  sadly the oil/gas companies have been the impact on the cars they produce and not so much the consumers.

9 2018-12-05 23:59:18 Why oil ?
10 2018-12-05 23:59:16 Agree, and when you give them a dose of their own medicine, it's like you were the one responsible for the price hike of the crude oil. that affected the world economy.
11 2018-12-05 23:59:16 But what about the oil price???

12 2018-12-05 23:59:05 Chevy Vega = oil leak.
13 2018-12-05 23:58:51 Actually you are right! We don't need any price on oil because we should stop using, other than for non alternative basics, and start finding and using sustainable energy that won't ruin the earth.
14 2018-12-05 23:58:50 Your question doesn’t even make sense. But hypothetically, I’d rather people make money by addressing the problem, i.e. climate change, opposed to oil companies that take in massive profits while destroying our planet.
15 2018-12-05 23:58:44 Great idea, and their sons+daughters too. Why the feck can't you guys TALK, use diplomacy to solve your differences.  ordinary people will not fight for corporations any more. or for oil either. We'd rather sit in the dark, thanks v much, so you can poke your wars where it hurts.
16 2018-12-05 23:58:31 I wonder about this comment and it relationship to the Saudis. Is somebody using his position to push up oil prices and make a little profit for himself along the way, Bu complain about Marcon sticking on a fuel tax.
17 2018-12-05 23:58:24 So hypothetically, a person that works on an oil rig donates $50 to your otherwise perfect candidate. When I say perfect I mean you literally agree with them on every policy. If they don't return that money, you're out? I don't believe you for a second.

43 2018-12-05 23:57:56 Oil is finite, damaging to the environment and messed with political corruption. Solar and wind are free, easily to obtain and becoming more efficient.

Clean energy is the future. Fissile fuels are the past.

47 2018-12-05 23:57:35 Additionally, it's imperative we make FF contributions taboo. Anyone taking them is essentially of the position that humans don't contribute to climate change. That's a GOP position. Untenable in these times. It's time to shit or get off the oil pot.

52 2018-12-05 23:57:07 Olive oil in my ears, Vic on my chest, vasoline around the eyes, I'm ready....to drop. Get behind the velvet rope, you wouldn't want to catch it ladies.
53 2018-12-05 23:57:05 I just bought some oil while waiting for my train...I feel like I’m a city girl for real now

55 2018-12-05 23:56:48 Almost up to 89K! 55 month oil change recently. Drove 1525 miles over 1667 days. I average less than a mile per day! No commute for 13 years + use G's car for most stuff we do. Simple!
56 2018-12-05 23:56:48 ...going to be sponsored by Exxon oil.
57 2018-12-05 23:56:48 World's biggest oil traders bribed Petrobras staff: prosecutors
58 2018-12-05 23:56:42 We can live perfectly fine without any Saudi oil.  Stop selling our country's morals and reputation to these murderers.
59 2018-12-05 23:56:40 Donald said we need Saudi Arabia because of their oil. Reasoning for not admitting MSB had nothing to do with the brutal assassination of Jamal. Remember when President Obama was in office, he used our own oil reserves to stop price gouging by other Countries.
60 2018-12-05 23:56:28 And today we have western governments arming terrorists in the Middle East for political expediency. We have to find a way to get rid of the parasites who are destroying entire races of people this way in order to steal natural resources (oil). Hear me, @neeratanden?
61 2018-12-05 23:56:25 So apparently sucking dick with coconut oil is the wave. 
62 2018-12-05 23:56:23 #OilSpillDiscipline I know  Caroline whats crazy is that it actually affects the animals by two ways: 1 is through the oil itself, and if it weren't sad enough,  the 2nd is through our methods of cleaning up the mess... can you believe it? Doing more damage by trying to fix it
63 2018-12-05 23:56:15 You like our planet? Because oil is killing it.
64 2018-12-05 23:56:13 Look at him working in that beard oil.
65 2018-12-05 23:56:07 Finally I see a tweet with some real teeth in it! You could not be more right! It's all about the money and the oil. In the end, he will literally get away with murder. #Justiceisbroken
66 2018-12-05 23:56:06 And we shouldn't be using palm oil in anything edible anyway.
67 2018-12-05 23:56:04 You do realize crude oil prices are edging into the range where it becomes unprofitable for American producers to continue operations?
68 2018-12-05 23:55:58 I used coconut oil & let it sit on her scalp for awhile before brushing with a fine comb, and I also only washed her hair with a tiny amount of baby shampoo mixed with coconut oil. It cleared her scalp up within a week!
69 2018-12-05 23:55:56 Okay that’s what I tried to do with olive oil and it was still gross. Not to mention the smell 
70 2018-12-05 23:55:55 About an incentive instead of taxes? Whatever it takes to cut out the 30% of our oil supply that comes from the Saudis. Believe in climate change or not, I feel everyone could agree to cutting the Saudis out.
71 2018-12-05 23:55:51 They’re all corrupt. Except Bernie. Hahahaha Are you ignorant to how much money Big Oil and AIPAC have given Beto? Or don’t you care about that corruption? Are you ignorant to Bernie fighting for equal rights for blacks including housing while Dems kept them locked up via policy?
72 2018-12-05 23:55:46 *fresh* mushrooms, some feta, and a drizzle of a nice olive oil... maybe chicken too.

74 2018-12-05 23:55:27 Why aren't they using their melon heads and ask who is going to clean up all of this mess? Once government funding stops and the landscape is riddled with rusting oil leaking wind turbines that cost a fortune to build and operate and destroys the earth they vow to protect.

76 2018-12-05 23:55:18 ...anyways beyond the speech itself he seems like an enigma, like he supported a tax on domestic oil profits to fund economic relief, but at the same time he appointed Volcker.
77 2018-12-05 23:55:17 I disagree....Not when so many thousands of barrels of oil unaccounted for
78 2018-12-05 23:54:58 we all know who the snake oil salesman is
79 2018-12-05 23:54:51 They shot themselves hard with the Qatar issue...and now Qatar wants to quit Opec, that allows them sell and negotiate their oil sales freely...in the end they are the winners, they will host the Mundial...wow,tiny Qatar @Nass see o.
80 2018-12-05 23:54:38 Mr. President:
The price of oil wil fluctuate, that's the nature of all commodities. What the world needs is a free press. Allowing a reporter's murderer to go unpunished, for the sake of low oil prices, is the most un-American thing you have done in a while.
81 2018-12-05 23:54:23 well, it's a large state, with a candidate who raised nearly $80mln in Senate campaign.  "Oil" contributions as a percentage of his total raise are i would guess are significantly smaller than anyone else taking money from energy industry.
82 2018-12-05 23:54:23 LFC is the real deal you chitty chitty cry cry baby... a few plastic oily cups and all of a sudden MCFC is top of the food chain... your clubs success is dirtier than a chinese fish fryers oil drip tray.

88 2018-12-05 23:53:55 Please ask someone you trust where the bulk of U.S oil comes from. OPEC no longer  has the control on AMerican consumers they had in the past. Also you don't care about the world, your mantra is America First. Perhaps you forget. Donald Dementia .

94 2018-12-05 23:53:41 Have you read Panic at the Pump? I mean, you’re right that Caddell was the wrong influence at the time, and he misread what ppl like Lasch were saying. But I wouldn’t say he was saying the economy was too successful, I think it’s much more about the specifics of the oil embargo..
95 2018-12-05 23:53:38 If they think they have figured President Trump out and that he is doing everything he can to help America they would be right.  If they think they can put one over on him, they are wrong.  He promised to get the price of oil down for us.  He has. 
96 2018-12-05 23:53:23 I figured out what bothers me about #SiliconValley: the same hyper-vocal group that complains about the anti-social effects of the #FAANG products doggedly recruits engineers from those companies. Have you considered that the right people refuse to oil The Machine?

104 2018-12-05 23:52:43 I normally just wash my face then follow with coconut oil right after.
105 2018-12-05 23:52:40 Of course OPEC has less impact that it did.  Canada has greater impact on our fuel prices.  Donnie is quite the Guru of Oil for the 1970’s
106 2018-12-05 23:52:34 Trump dropped tariffs to China if they would buy Oil from America. So Canadian OIL SENT SOUTH TO USA is now sold to China! What kind of deal did Trudeau make with the Chinese? TRUMP trumped Canada. It’s going to be a hard candy xmas for Albertans .

112 2018-12-05 23:52:09 Mr PM the bottom line is persons have to go to prison over this. You can’t have over 600k barrels of oil unaccounted for and no one goes to prison. The people of JAMAICA will accept nothing less. Please leave the little man out of this...we need a BIG FISH.
113 2018-12-05 23:52:00 well it depends for shale oil producers yes they need higher prices

123 2018-12-05 23:50:53 I do appreciate this real emotion. quite touching. but I wonder if he thought of parents having emotions like this for children being sent off to die in a fake war meant only to enrich Cheney & his oil pals? Or children who grew up never knowing their soldier parent?
124 2018-12-05 23:50:42 So do you really believe that wind and solar will ever have a chance at replacing oil and gas? It just will not work son. Not in a million years. It would be nice if it would, but that is not the reality that we live in. Wake up!
125 2018-12-05 23:50:36 If only we had the same protection against attacks on our democracy. Our government dances to the tune of lobbyists, oil barons, arms dealers and media moguls. Look at how they got the bad guys off the hook with the Leveson Inquiry. Or fracking. Or dirty Russian money.
126 2018-12-05 23:50:35 i worked 8 hours today, took my car for an oil change without my dad, made dinner so my mom wouldn’t have to and now i’m doing laundry. i feel like a full functioning adult i’m scared

130 2018-12-05 23:50:07 It is a new crisis because Alberta oil is selling at $10/barrel (globally around $50), due to inability to get product to market and one customer - the US. The capacity problem has been ongoing, yes, but, there were several pipeline proposals in the works, reduced now to one.
131 2018-12-05 23:50:04 Made in U.S.A.,  U.S.A., make everything everywhere by oil, gold, coltan, water, do not matter kill somebody if they think can do opposition to get what they want.

138 2018-12-05 23:49:02 Not a single person in Alberta, no citizen, no corporate leader, no past or present politician, takes any responsibility, whatsoever, for the sorry state of the Alberta oil and gas industry and the lack of a sovereign fund. It's all @JustinTrudeau's fault, every single issue.
139 2018-12-05 23:48:59 Invest in renewable energy sources & we won’t be so dependent on foreign oil.  Of course your buddies in the fossil fuel industry wouldn’t like that one bit.  Their $$$ would dry up & we all know money comes before everything else with you!
140 2018-12-05 23:48:49 Here’s another realistic clue - what you’re stating is not going to happen overnight.  Show me wind or solar or electric that is profitable at the moment.  Current energy needs are current energy needs and wishful thinking is not a solution.  Let alone the Global need for oil...

162 2018-12-05 23:46:13 Yes but, Donald, the world does need to see less oil consumption. You do get that don't you. Don't you?
163 2018-12-05 23:46:08 So what's your geopolitical alternative?  You really need to learn that the world, especially the middle east, is not black or white. It's at best gray or black.  You can't destabilize 1/2 the worlds oil supply because a journalist with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood dies.
164 2018-12-05 23:46:08 you should use tea tree oil! helps with redness/swelling and also acne if you will happen to have any. theres a lot of skincare with it out there just make sure it contains a decent percentage of it and isnt the last ingredient on the list

psa: please never spend more than about $35 on an oil change; also, for the love of god, change your own air filters. it’s about 1/3 of the price.

171 2018-12-05 23:45:27 I'm all for a "Just Transition" i.e. securing the future and livelihoods of oil/coal workers in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
But this call must be paired w/a call for justice & decent work for workers in sectors of economy that are already low-carbon, like care workers
172 2018-12-05 23:45:24 So these are all oil/gas execs?

174 2018-12-05 23:45:12 Most fluids that are called oil aren't based off of crude. New engines require full synthetic oil, and most other fluids are all synthetic compounds as well.
175 2018-12-05 23:45:11 When Bush the Elder was President, it was the first time we were straight-up Going To War since Viet Nam. I was pretty sure I was going to be drafted to suppress oil prices.

We marched on DC in defense of homeless people, instead.

Bush the Elder did approximately nothing.
176 2018-12-05 23:45:08 Millions of migrating birds and raptors unceremoniously sacrificed at the evil altar of climate religion. Yet alarmists scream in horror at an oil covered duckling and refuse sleep until each one is tenderly cleaned. Misplaced outrage.
177 2018-12-05 23:45:07 Yes Sherry Oil Never Sleeps! Keep up the good work!
178 2018-12-05 23:45:01 Yet both Drayton Valley AND Alberta as a whole have lots of unfilled jobs in the oil patch.
179 2018-12-05 23:45:00 Really, people who call digital artists “fake” are also the same kinds of people who’d fail at mastering oil painting, watercolor, or drawing with markers and color pencils.
180 2018-12-05 23:44:52 A4 ABSOLUTELY! Oil mining is important but we need to make sure this doesn’t happen again and if it does there has to be a plan in place. What regulations are in place now? #OilSpillDiscipline

182 2018-12-05 23:44:23 Not saying Beto needs to run for President but the only reason he has so many oil and gas donations is because those come from literally *anyone* who works for an oil and gas company, not necessarily CEOs, so, chill??

200 2018-12-05 23:42:35 I don’t think it was so much the link as it was the misrepresentation and lack of context that was the issue. It’s not unfathomable that a person running in a state like TX getting donations from its citizens would in part comprise of ppl who work in the oil industry.

212 2018-12-05 23:41:21 Saddam invaded Iran, was successful in invading Kuwait and threatened every oil producing state in the region. Had he taken control of it all, it would have been WWIII. 35 nations participated in the liberation of Kuwait. Read real books.
213 2018-12-05 23:41:01 You do know that oil is a finite resource right?
214 2018-12-05 23:40:55 The Green New Deal has an AFL-CIO problem. AFL-CIO are participants in the Carbon Capture Coalition which is a product of the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative. One of the most successful bipartisan efforts of Trump presidency was the expansion of #45Q tax credits. #CCUS
215 2018-12-05 23:40:51 Funny how you talk about caring yet YOUR president is selling arms and bombs to Saudi Arabia and killing hundreds of thousands of people on a war for oil

217 2018-12-05 23:40:50 Not smart to impose tariffs on Saudi Arabia, it'd increase oil prices and damage the arms deals. The prince needs to be held accountable individually, not the whole country, but idk if there is a way Senators can put him on trial.
218 2018-12-05 23:40:47 Need a not like button for this statement!! I think no palm oil is the way forward for me. I've been trying lately and it's not that hard if you avoid processed foods.  Still a no to @CadburyUK and a yes to @Morrisons chocolate. Shame though my husband loved dairy milk.
219 2018-12-05 23:40:46 He also hasn't bothered checking the sale price for oil produced from the Bakken deposit, which in terms of quality is quite similar to Alberta's. I'm getting tired of politicians who are entirely willing to make themselves look slack-jaw stupid just to shill partisan snake oil.

My spatula/turner isn't big enough to lift out all three at once.
So I cut them as seen and lifted them onto my plate one at a time.
225 2018-12-05 23:40:16 Considering that #Trump still prefer to cover for the crown prince for better oil prices, then believe the evidence gathered by US Intelligence - does this make America an accessory to #murder ? #ForeignPolicy

228 2018-12-05 23:40:10 The only way it could be more expensive is if your charging massive amounts on credit cards ie living above your means in the first place. Natural gas prices down, oil down, electric stable with last year, food maybe 2% increase so why write such an absurd article?
229 2018-12-05 23:40:06 When committing insurance fraud and murdering thousands of civilians by staging a fake terror attack to justify the invasion of the east to steal their oil and natural resources, how long does it take jet fuel to melt steel beams?

According to NYT, "during presidential campaign, Michael D. Cohen and Felix Sater, an associate with a criminal past, pursued a new Trump Tower project"

Whilst that cook your preferred pasta/grain- Italian couscous was mine. Serve over an exuberant amount of baby spinach like a warm salad. Add tofu if you like
256 2018-12-05 23:37:41 Interesting, eh, that no conservatives, federal or provincial, take any responsibility for the state of the Alberta oil and gas industry. Yet, the problems today are a direct consequence of federal and provincial Conservative mismanagement and incompetence. Typical.
257 2018-12-05 23:37:40 Putting aside the donation issue, Beto made it clear during the campaign that he supports the oil and gas industry in the state of Texas.  This is not some deep, well kept secret.  That is why I say he doesn't get it  although he may be great on many other issues.
258 2018-12-05 23:37:27 Actually you can thank president Trump.  He's the one that told the Saudi's to up oil production and bring the price of gas down.  Another promise kept.  We're winning so much with Mr. Trump don't know how much longer we can take it, like he said.  MAGA!!

263 2018-12-05 23:36:56 Saudi Arabia, Russia & other members of the OPEC+ group recommended an oil production cut starting in Jan 2019. Investors should snap up cheap shares after US-China agreed to hit pause on their trade dispute & growth will likely reward investors with a more aggressive stance

270 2018-12-05 23:35:43 Rare earth mining for solar panel materials largely sourced in China is polluting on a massive scale. Wind mills are created from steel forged by coal and require huge amounts of grease and oil to keep running. Much of that ends up in the surrounding environment

273 2018-12-05 23:35:28 @PnPCBC Vassy, I've lived in Calgary for 30 years, this oil crisis  lies squarely on the shoulders of present and past Alberta Premiers for not having refineries built so our oil wasn't sent outside of Alberta, Canada. Their short sightedness, lack to want to invest is to blame.

277 2018-12-05 23:34:47 I go to such extremes to keep positive energies around me that I have water fountains, oil diffusers and plants in my office to keep a relaxing atmosphere.
278 2018-12-05 23:34:44 Bullshit.  Next to no one is paying that price for our oil.  Do a little research.  The largest producers are insulated from WCS price by upgrading before shipping.
279 2018-12-05 23:34:36 It's really not socialism considering their food distribution is privatised + US/Israel monsters back Saudi in flooding the markets with cheap oil, leaving countries to be forced into Western capitalist economies. MSM neoliberal control networks know that

301 2018-12-05 23:32:06 Like any uncontrolled foreign interest group,  they help American farmers by causing harm to Canadian farmers.   It's the same problem we see in the oil business with American lobby groups.  DU once tried to coexist with us.  Now they are the outright enemy.
302 2018-12-05 23:32:05 Isn’t anyone curious about the fact that during his trip to Moscow in early July 2016, Carter Page “and associates” were offered brokerage of a 19% share in the Russian state-owned oil company in exchange for lifting of sanctions? #thebeat @TheBeatWithAri
303 2018-12-05 23:32:00 I don't understand it.

@JustinTrudeau there must be a focus on this industry.  Companies have spent billions of dollars to adhere to govt requirements.  Oil doesn't have to be the centre of our economy but there must be support to green light projects and employ Canadians.

334 2018-12-05 23:29:39 I know oil usage for such things won’t stop because they are importan but I do think that overall oil usage should be kept to a minimum because it is detrimental to the environment and is causing our world to warm.

339 2018-12-05 23:29:11 even on 200 bn, that is an extra 9 bn per year.. US oil imports often increase by 100 bn from one year to the next.. 

Initial tariffs were on intermediate parts as well, if 10% of a product is a comp. with a tariff on it, the cost increase would be less than 1%.. NOT 4.5%..

346 2018-12-05 23:28:31 From what I’ve heard from various researchers, the North Sea Oil and Gas won’t last more than 50 years so not really a good reason.  I prefer to think of a union created in history before any such minerals were found.  I’ve friends in each of the countries and love them all
347 2018-12-05 23:28:23 So many things wrong with it:
1. No technology exists to build a 1,900 km underseas pipeline
2. Why does the UAE think India wants it or will invest
3. Oil may not be a major fuel in the future
4. Submarines could collide with the suspended tunnels. It's a highly militarised area

364 2018-12-05 23:26:09 I think the main issue is that some people believe that donations  from individual oil and gas people is fine and you should differentiate.   I don't agree but I think you should address that.
365 2018-12-05 23:26:02 Get a clue. There is a climate crisis that threatens our future. Spending money on pipeline and oil sands expansion makes no sense at all. Time to create a vibrant diverse economy that is not dependent on oil.
366 2018-12-05 23:26:01 Ohhhh. Russia can't afford fuel oil and food for its population,  it sure as hell cannot afford an armed race.
367 2018-12-05 23:25:53 Well, oil is oil wherever it's from but if we have to burn it at all, I'd rather it was from .

398 2018-12-05 23:23:14 You are correct your’s is not an attack but it is also not good journalism.
Math - Beto raised +/-$100Million for Senate run.  Amazing. Apparently to your upset oil/gas industry folk gave him in total +/- $500K, about 1/2% of total raised. So your point is & why is that serious?
399 2018-12-05 23:23:06 This is useful information. Economics is too proto to have predicted this, but it is good to know. Another thing economics cannot predict, but is probably true, is that shutting down an oil company will probably incentivize renewables.

409 2018-12-05 23:22:21 Been smoking gas since they found oil 
410 2018-12-05 23:22:09 I have same question.  We are looking at putting up another heated building.  Looking at waste oil heater and solar. Appreciate any info on either?
411 2018-12-05 23:22:05 I slept an hour, took a final, probably failed the final, took my car for an oil change, washed my clothes at a laundromat, cashed my check, cleaned my car, went to xmas shop, and I have yet to make dinner.

414 2018-12-05 23:22:00 Nothing in Bakersfield but, 50% unemployed folks begging at every corner, empty commercial buildings for miles and miles and a dying oil/gas industry. By all means, let’s build an extra access to there.??
415 2018-12-05 23:21:55 Bottom line they can’t tell me what will happen next week, but ten years from now “We’re all going to die” BTW Gore said that ten years ago.  Snake oil salesmen
416 2018-12-05 23:21:55 Clearly though, the current transport capacity problem has been ongoing for a very long time and yet it’s being spun in the media recently and by big oil lobbyists as a new crisis in order to hard sell the Trans Mountain expansion in the West and in particular to BC.

431 2018-12-05 23:21:03 it is holy  jews after being forced out discovered in a temple only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for 8 days considered a miracle.
432 2018-12-05 23:20:51 Lmao it's not a claim. It's not just a few people saying it either. Kids the best there's no question. But there's also no question the Oil have a serious lack of depth.
433 2018-12-05 23:20:47 In a nutshell, it’s a Jewish holiday to celebrate the miracle when the oil was enough for 8 whole days to light the menorah in the temple

435 2018-12-05 23:20:33 uhhh so last night I threw a granola bar out of my window and it landed on my car, I forgot about until now.. the guy changing my oil just asked me about it bC IT FELL UNDER THE HOOD OF MY CAR
436 2018-12-05 23:20:32 Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.'”

442 2018-12-05 23:19:45 Beto did  not take donations "from the oil & gas industry."  He took donations from people who work in that industry, as well as many others.  OF COURSE a number of people who donated to Beto work in the oil & gas industry.  DUH.
443 2018-12-05 23:19:37 If you clear the oil/Petroleum/etc. filters, Beto has 10,326 large donors.
So petroleum made up less than .7% of Beto’s big donors.

Congratulations, investigative reporters. You proved Texans donated to Beto’s campaign.

463 2018-12-05 23:17:26 Get a damn oil change you can go on Groupon for like 20 
464 2018-12-05 23:17:14 Electric cars cost more than they are worth. You can’t have electricity without fuel. Not enough to supply what you’re demanding, that is. We can never go without oil.
465 2018-12-05 23:17:12 My new favorite thing is reading articles about “I tried CBD oil for it’s pain reducing & anti-inflammatory qualities & omg this is amazing here’s all the reasons I’m clearly high af and have no idea!!!”
466 2018-12-05 23:17:08 No.
Mounds is like a lump of chocolate filled with soggy toenail clippings that were soaked in suntan oil and sugar.
467 2018-12-05 23:17:07 I love good cheese, particularly blue. My favourite indulgence tea is really good hard core rye bread, Yorkshire blue cheese and black olives. 
Btw Waitrose do a really good truffle oil (extract not essence) which is amazing in rissoto.
468 2018-12-05 23:17:04 How about a sustainable, environmentally friendly, national water project that uses oil pipeline technology to move water, vice crude. Perhaps we'd find out that we get enough water every year, but we just mismanage it. (Feel free to name it after me! )
469 2018-12-05 23:17:03 #Scheernonsense spreading over Canada like a coating of Alberta Oil. The CPC and Cons. controlled Canada, and Alberta for years. Nothing was accomplished. But wait! ...in the future...this Scheer nobody will do..??????? what??????
470 2018-12-05 23:17:03 The diary industry is run on oil, begins with fuel to destroy the forests for farming, but that's not the point I was trying to make, If the dairy industry stopped, oil would drop faster than an uppercut from Tyson
471 2018-12-05 23:16:52 @realDonaldTrump Fake news is effecting media that covers the stock market. Today I look at the reports. Nothing but negative forecasts. Fake news is trying to sour the market to get at you. I’ve seen this before with fake news saying we’re running out of oil.
472 2018-12-05 23:16:50 I wonder if it will go up after Alberta oil rose this week?
473 2018-12-05 23:16:49 I couldn’t agree more. 
She spoke English as she was interacting with the British AI companies. 
Some zealots (that’s the appropriate term) complain, and it gets picked up by media. She apologizes.
Then, CTV makes it sound like she apologized for speaking English: oil on fire.

488 2018-12-05 23:15:28 We need laws and regulations to phase out fossil fuels. We've done it before with smaller things: the ozone layer is recovering because we're phasing out fluorocarbons. Bald eagles still exist because we banned DDT. Phasing out oil & gas are a bigger deal, but we need to do it.

497 2018-12-05 23:14:41 This afternoon we visited a local olive processing co-op.  It was interesting to see how olives are pressed and turned into olive oil.  The local farmers bring the olives from their trees to the co-op to have them pressed into olive oil and paste.
498 2018-12-05 23:14:39 if anybody knows how to change car oil hmu!
499 2018-12-05 23:14:38 Okay: 4 cans high protein cannelini beans. olive oil. Cumin seeds. Salt, pepper, a little tabasco. Bake at 360 cor 40 minutes. Simple. Addictive. Heat leftovers in microwave for best results.
500 2018-12-05 23:14:36 Yes, Tiny, rivers, no, oceans of oil! Cheapest fuel ever, so we need more and bigger cars just the same! And free plastic bags for everyone, every day! And next tweet don't forget to remind us: More coal has to be burnt! It's freezing out there - gotto fight the global cooling!

503 2018-12-05 23:14:19 As simply as adding 2+2, fracking = more oil on national soil = less dependence from outside sources = better strategic position. With fracking oil has never gone beyond the $80 a barrel, noticed that? Do some research.

517 2018-12-05 23:12:55 That was your agreement with MBS, wasn’t it? You let MBS torture and dismember an American resident/journalist without *any consequences,* & MBS will lower oil prices. You’re so blind to reality, you don’t recognize your own gross depravity.
518 2018-12-05 23:12:44 goerge h w bush would often lament that while he was born too late to explore the planet and too early to explore the stars, he was born right on time to explore his own toilet. oil himself up and slide down the toilet. to discover what was in those pipes, which is how he died
519 2018-12-05 23:12:39 Or we could make up for less oil with RENEWABLES
520 2018-12-05 23:12:21 How could Ledbetter possibly know that the majority of fuel bought in Alabama was by out of state persons?  That is abject BS. When oil gets back to $100 a barrel, and it will, people will be hurting, badly.

528 2018-12-05 23:11:18 Seems very plausible. But like so many things, we think this is the new reality - high oil prices was another one, c2007 - and it ain't necessarily so.
529 2018-12-05 23:11:08 I know recycling and up-cycling and donating and reusing is only good for so much and it’s the corporations killing the planet but when you go for a walk and see trash on the ground n oil slicks on the roads, that’s our faults. We can make a difference no matter how small.

539 2018-12-05 23:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Cool #Whip this December? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!
540 2018-12-05 23:10:06 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
541 2018-12-05 23:10:04 Wait a tick, so you want us to give you credit when oil process are low, but you want to blame OOEC when they go up?
542 2018-12-05 23:10:03 Yes it does! Oil must become obsolete to save our planet from disaster. Stop being such a stubborn fool!
543 2018-12-05 23:09:58 Oh and I go by Zephy! I like drawing oc art and fan art. Im trying to get my self in to more fan art and such? Not only do I do graphic design and digital drawings I love oil painting as well!
544 2018-12-05 23:09:48 In part due to perceived opportunism over oil resources, along with Hitler's hubris and Slavophobia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was violated, which in turn lead to the deaths of millions of Europeans.

These are the 'appalling consequences' that Dugin is likely referring to.
545 2018-12-05 23:09:36 So now you are Oil Man?
546 2018-12-05 23:09:35 When I went to class this morning Brad took my car to get an oil change because he knows I’m too lazy to do it, AND filled up my tank
547 2018-12-05 23:09:33 You’re persistently pushing the perception that a politician taking small private donations from people that work in the huge oil industry ( is he meant to collect from ski instructors in Tx?) ‘might’ be dirty.
548 2018-12-05 23:09:29 I quit all makeup, cleansers and moisturizers. I wash my face with washcloth and tea, hydrate with almond or coconut oil. And never go out where I need makeup  benefits of quiet life.
549 2018-12-05 23:09:23 Will they be actual game jerseys like most other NHL teams do or replacement retail jerseys like in years past...#BaitAndSwitch
550 2018-12-05 23:09:13 You’re poll numbers don’t want to see or need higher oil prices.
551 2018-12-05 23:09:09 Tillerson elevated Putin to hero status by getting Exxon to build an Arctic offshore drilling platform above an enormous oil field. Deal was signed in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea
Reported to be a $500bn deal.  Never underestimate the power of oil.
552 2018-12-05 23:09:01 Preventing Burn Injuries
- When cooking with hot oil or a deep fryer, keep your child a safe distance from the source.
- When cooking, keep pot handles turned inward on the stovetop and away from the edge of the stove.

555 2018-12-05 23:08:50 Kimmm! That’s horrible!  Do you at least check your oil? Put air in your tires?? Get oil changes ???!
556 2018-12-05 23:08:50 Explain to us why we aren't using our own oil. We have enough that prices could be $1.00 a gallon. Why are we buying from the Middle East?
557 2018-12-05 23:08:39 Its okay to use drying product tapi berpada pada. Ni semua trigger kulit jdi oily. Sunblock tu matte finishing kering. Cleanser kering, toner tea tree pun kering. Ada moisturisor je. Hydrator nak balance kan oil dengan water tak ada. So ur skin produce more oil.
558 2018-12-05 23:08:22 大丈夫ですよー、ランボーよりもTLの魅力に逆らえず、パツンパツンの衣装着て宇多田ヒカル歌う姿拝めましたから・・・おはようございます！
559 2018-12-05 23:08:21 Oh and your welcome for the billions that the country received in oil revenue
560 2018-12-05 23:08:19 WTF!
561 2018-12-05 23:08:15 Oil, gas, Wall Street, and everything else 2020.
562 2018-12-05 23:08:09 The only future left for Scotland is Independence When you think of the wasted Trillions from oil and what it Could have done for the country it makes you realise Scotland can do better outside the UK
563 2018-12-05 23:08:01 Suspicious. Got my oil changed and now there's a hole in my pan. Can't GO
564 2018-12-05 23:08:00 The bread with tomato oil and salt is a staple in BCN. In the meantime, I will go ahead a devour a steak in Houston!
565 2018-12-05 23:07:59 If only you understood US oil market- start with baker Hugh’s oil rig counts since 2015. US & Canada can produce enough oil to drop oil prices under 40 dollars a barrel. OPEC needs oil to be around 60.00 a barrel to break even. Facts Donny
566 2018-12-05 23:07:57 He said "Ride me Baby!"

Soooooooo....
567 2018-12-05 23:07:52 Sneakers(tennis shoes), chips, and is that Motor Oil 5w30. What store is this!
568 2018-12-05 23:07:50 The man who sold the military to Saudi Arabia in exchange for Kuwaiti oil. That pissed off UBL who attacked the twin towers twice and led us to Afghanistan. That spiraled into the Iraq war that spawned ISIS. Yes, I do believe we can identify genesis in this formula.
569 2018-12-05 23:07:42 They weren’t acting like this before good ol Abdul came along with a couple gallons of oil
570 2018-12-05 23:07:40 Several months before Trudy bought the pipeline with our money he said we are getting out of oil. He’s bi polar as a skunk
571 2018-12-05 23:07:24 becoz i look like i big oil filled egg xXX
572 2018-12-05 23:07:22 come have an oil party with me
573 2018-12-05 23:07:10 Guess I’ll go get my oil changed in the morning before work 
574 2018-12-05 23:06:56 Here In Australia, We Had a Shop Called The “Body Shop” The Products Were Body Essentials, Body Oil, Moisturisers, Cleanings Creams, All made up of Natural Ingredients with No Added Chemicals. I’d Shop once a Week in a Friday after Work. I Kinda Miss the “Body Shop”.
575 2018-12-05 23:06:47 #Canada's reserves are 3rd only to Vez an Saudi. Over 95% of these reserves are in oil sands deposits in the province of Alberta.

#Canada is the 2nd largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world. Hydroelectricity accounts for 59.3 per cent of the cnty's electricity supply.
576 2018-12-05 23:06:43 Global whiner !!!
577 2018-12-05 23:06:42 @SenFitzgerald nice job on bipartisanship you over spinning snake oil salesmen. Now you have the nation's attention for your petty attempt to usurp power.  Shameful and disgusting!
578 2018-12-05 23:06:38 That's why, in line with this confident assertion, you've made strenuous efforts to close down tar sands and cancel all oil/gas pipelines. Oh....
579 2018-12-05 23:06:37 Learn to fry and scramble eggs. That just takes eggs, a pan, and some cooking oil. Plus if you screw up on eggs, they cheap. You won't curse yourself for that one.
580 2018-12-05 23:06:32 It’s crazy cause I tried roaccutame which is strong as hell. Didn’t do shit for my skin. But since I’ve been using bio oil on my face... boyy
581 2018-12-05 23:05:48 What good is clean air if you got no food? Would you rather be starving next to a beautiful river or full next to an oil filled one? Checkmate lib

584 2018-12-05 23:05:34 @KITKAT and @Doritos - taste good but are apparently still buying from one of the dirtiest palm oil giants, Wilmar. Let's give them a nudge... @Greenpeace #PalmOil #deforestation
585 2018-12-05 23:05:18 Not surprised by your answer.  FYI the oil comes from Alberta.  The province is a part of Canada. The company was about to shut down all operation. No it is still running 24/7. Things could have been much worse. And yes. Your welcome.
586 2018-12-05 23:05:17 It’s a more nuanced film than most give credit, in which China is prevented from leading in renewable energy (resulting in a ‘green war’ between nations) when the British govt. returns the Solex Agitator to BP so that they can quietly bury the technology & continue selling oil.
587 2018-12-05 23:05:12 Is it possible to overdose on Olbas Oil?  Asking for a friend...
588 2018-12-05 23:05:11 @RachelNotley there's no energy crisis in bc we have an abundance of wind water and sun all giving us abundant energy. And we are going to cash in on all this free energy here for the harvesting. Rachel will die in her shoes stuck in the oil patch wondering why she cant run
589 2018-12-05 23:05:09 They said they discovered oil in muzaravani why are they begging to import.....
590 2018-12-05 23:05:03 They are going to flood the market to bankrupt the Texas and US oil producers who can't  profit from these low prices. Aren't you a business genius to know that?
591 2018-12-05 23:04:57 Israel controls The World Bank, then oil , and is a nuclear superpower.
America is stuck paying the bill.
Zionism will be more than just a bad dream. Zionism will reign supreme. How could with be so stupid?

593 2018-12-05 23:04:29 #winitwednesday love coconut oil
594 2018-12-05 23:04:29 Perhaps most interesting is a property on Nelson Island of which Suzuki is one of several co-owners listed on a B.C. land title registry, another of which includes Kootenay Oil Distributors.

596 2018-12-05 23:04:04 Well we sure don’t need cheap prices!!  Stop subsidizing oil companies!  We already have more and more competitive renewables and good jobs in those fields. Are you unable to move forward?
597 2018-12-05 23:03:54 @repvos Nice job on bipartisanship you overspinning snake oil salesmen.  Now you have the nation's attention for your petty attempt to usurp power.  Shameful and disgusting!
598 2018-12-05 23:03:50 Tah la. Awal bulan 11 pakai cleanser HL & cleansing oil aku perasan blackhead hilang. Tapi taktau products mana yang buat tu, otak jem juga lah nak fikir. Tak lama tu tiny bumps hukss. Skrg tgh pakai cleaning oil simple. So far ok. Nanti nak cuba cleansing milk nanowhite lak 
599 2018-12-05 23:03:46 Some dude keeps hitting up the Kin Slips insta to sell us oil and has called me “bro” 4 times while ignoring my messages asking him to email us. What a time to be alive!

602 2018-12-05 23:03:22 When I had to sign in to get my oil changed, I wrote my CWID instead of my name. Is the semester over yet? 
603 2018-12-05 23:03:16 Who care bout dat?!? Where are the 600,000 + barrels?!? My greatest concern is the oil. It was no properly accounted for...and how can a finance department not have a meeting for TWO consecutive years?!?
604 2018-12-05 23:02:58 Sitting in a chair imagining the green jobs I will have in 2020. I believe I will be a cobbler of hemp shoes and a cyberpunk assassin targeting fugitive oil executives.

606 2018-12-05 23:02:58 We do not get most of our oil from OPEC!
607 2018-12-05 23:02:53 Large oil spill from a culvert at the Star Market on River St. Hazmat team there.
608 2018-12-05 23:02:52 Gonna document this tonight in hope that everything works out tmrw but my 2018 Toyota with 5500 miles on it over the last 13 months magically had the oil cap off, killing the engine. I get the feeling they're trying to find a way to blame us and not pay for the fix. Super upset.
609 2018-12-05 23:02:50 All fries are not created equal ... so picking one number as a maximum, regardless of the size of the fries, and oil used in the frying process?
610 2018-12-05 23:02:50 Or, we could end our dependence on foreign oil by developing green technology.
611 2018-12-05 23:02:38 That's exactly my point... Your irresponsibility will hurt people outside of your province. Alberta asks for special help.all the time. Pipelines fast tracked, special EI provisions for oil workers. just fucking diversify already.
612 2018-12-05 23:02:37 Oil spill in Charles.
613 2018-12-05 23:02:29 Shh, don't give away my trade secrets.

618 2018-12-05 23:02:04 you realize oil and gas is the largest employer in Texas so it stands to reason that some of those employees would donate to beto? it’s not a nefarious scheme my dude

620 2018-12-05 23:01:35 So...the world does not want to need higher oil prices, then?
Tell me more...
621 2018-12-05 23:01:14 @RachelNotley the only energy crisis happening in Canada is inside your head. You totally lack the vital e edgy Alberta's need to move away from their dependency on an oil based economy
 You have no good ideas. You just keep flogging the same old dead horse a d it won't run again

625 2018-12-05 23:01:04 I happily attack the palm oil industry everywhere. It’s not ‘progress’ if it wipes out whole ecosystems & millions of species. It’s not your land by the way. We are custodians of planet earth.
626 2018-12-05 23:01:04 That’s funny as Alberta is going to cut there oil production by 325000 bpd to keep the price up on Western Canada Select.
627 2018-12-05 23:00:59 Ironic so many "progressive" commentators & news outlets now speak so generously about GWB? I thought he was BusHitler? Didn't he start a war to steal oil and help Haliburton? Didn't he lie about WMD to kill brown people? Or was that just "hate speech" the left purport to hate?
628 2018-12-05 23:00:58 We import more oil from Canada than any other country
629 2018-12-05 23:00:52 The people who financed those NGOs want to buy out our oil resources for pennies on the dollar. Never think that the green lobby actually cares about the environment. They want power, and free money.

I was worried Beto maybe received too much $ from petroleum, but your reporting clearly shows oil companies preferred Beto’s opponent.

659 2018-12-05 22:58:02 Same. Oil is just so much more convenient for my life
660 2018-12-05 22:58:01 Was there to watch it...Lucas Oil literally shook it got so loud. Greatest moment for sure that I have ever been a part of in person in sports
661 2018-12-05 22:57:57 Alberta is desperate to get our oil to the US. Build Keystone XL.
662 2018-12-05 22:57:54 Butts and Trudeau want the oil left in the ground and have said as much. Anti Canadians are running the country.
663 2018-12-05 22:57:53 When I make them myself, I just spread the bread with a mixture of olive oil and garlic powder. The cook down the street used to be appalled when I would ask for muff w/o salad. "Why don't I just make you a ham sandwich on muffuletta bread?"
664 2018-12-05 22:57:50 Many goods in capitalist societies (oil in Norway, copper in Chile) are used for social profit. Liberals Socializing private companies (rail, utilities, etc) is not by any means unheard of; socializing only a percentage of them is actually less radical than that
665 2018-12-05 22:57:49 Exactly, Chris. While it sounds great, where's the beef? I stopped following these snake oil salesmen. I don't care if they are in the resistance. We don't have time for this crap.
666 2018-12-05 22:57:26 Oil change...
667 2018-12-05 22:57:22 MEXICO, ETC.  #BUSH41'S GULF WAR JUST REPLACED ONE DICTATOR W/ ANOTHER, ALL F/ OIL, AND SET OFF BIN LADIN TO ATTACK US ON 9/11.  HE SUPPORTED HIS SON FOR PRESIDENT AND FOUGHT TO INSTALL HIM IN A COUP EVEN THOUGH HE LOST THE ELECTION TO AL #GORE BY OVER 1/2 A MILLION VOTES,
668 2018-12-05 22:57:17 I don’t support any pipeline, wherever it comes from, nor any oil. Having said that, we need to transition to renewable energy ASAP. The more oil we produce and support, the faster we dig our own graves. We need to STOP adding more tools to produce oil.
669 2018-12-05 22:57:14 ‘When anyone offers a grain offering to the Lord , his offering shall be of fine flour. And he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it.
Leviticus 2:1
670 2018-12-05 22:57:11 oil of every pearls uninsides. react to it and you’ll know why
671 2018-12-05 22:57:11 Yea let’s go back to using whale oil and trees.
672 2018-12-05 22:56:59 Earthquakes are minimal as for pollution, well... There’s not much going around that. Problem is we are still way too dependent on oil. On the plus side I think fracking is to be used only when oil goes above a certain price. Like a backup, thus forcing suppliers to keep it low.
673 2018-12-05 22:56:53 I just want to know hooow you can not have estimate for a contract, a WORKS at dat. And where dis 600,000+ bbls or unaccounted oil went
674 2018-12-05 22:56:52 Oil too.  What a bunch of aholes.
675 2018-12-05 22:56:47 Yes I have this cleanser by neutrogena called oil-𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐞 acne wash
676 2018-12-05 22:56:22 BTW - I have not been to Azerbaijan....  I have been to Dushanbe, Tajikistan and Takhar Provence, Afghanistan.   On the way home was sitting next to a British oil production engineer would been in Uzbekistan, leaving because of cross border skirmishes.
677 2018-12-05 22:56:19 Therefore same rules to follow but no say in the process of developing those rules as we currently do. Why become Norway when we currently have the best deal in EU - political mud wrestling will commit UK to a significantly weaker economic position. Norway's GDP depends on oil

681 2018-12-05 22:56:16 Tuit del chapu. Ayer Blackrock-Salinas vendió Sierra Oil a una empresa alemana con vínculos con el exdirector de PEP, Hinojosa. Y Blackrock es el que le pone trabas a los bonos del NAIM. Todo está interconectado.
¿Todo apunta a que si?

You go first Trumpster. 
Name all the US oil companies who funded climate science denial groups.
685 2018-12-05 22:55:41 I am sure with your cover up and aiding and abetting the murder of an American journalist the Saudi's will keep oil flowing along with the blood of the American journalist. You are morally unfit to be the so called president. You have brought shame to our Country. Resign.
686 2018-12-05 22:55:41 FFS, this bloke is a snake oil salesman of the highest order. Why is even getting the oxygen of #newsnight ?

689 2018-12-05 22:55:34 Ok clove oil  stinks but doese normally work nothing worse than toothache
690 2018-12-05 22:55:25 Idk, I think the tranquillity of your beautiful home might be significantly disrupted by having a crass, contentious, snake oil peddling browbeater living next door. Unscrupulous bullies might be useful in a fight but I’m not keen giving them influence over me or society.
691 2018-12-05 22:55:14 This last govt of Obama for 8 years was the most corrupt. He crippled this country he stopped all jobs for American worker such as oil industry coal. Well everyone who wants to go to college had better get an education on world affairs, history of what brought nations down.
692 2018-12-05 22:55:12 ... centrist #Democrats who sold out their constituents for big oil .. big phama & the military industrial complex helped trump get elected .. @davidsirota merely was one of a few journalists who had the balls to call it out ...
693 2018-12-05 22:54:57 Yet because they are based in the east they prefer to use Saudi oil but there is a real easy solution if they are so opposed to oil and gas, go to the back of the building to your gas meter and turn it off.

695 2018-12-05 22:54:56 Today i bought a water bottle from  @originalnathans and i held it by my arm. I Didnt realize that the water bottle was covered in frying oil. Now my jacket is covered in frying oil. WTFFFFFFFFFFFFF HOW DID THEY GET FRYING OIL ON A WATER BOTTLE????

700 2018-12-05 22:54:10 It's mostly fueled (no pun intended) by the carbon tax and the rise in oil prices at the gas pumps.

702 2018-12-05 22:54:05 Worst part about living in the city and not having a garage is having to go to a jiffy lube to get my oil changed. Bro let me pull up real quick and just do it myself I don’t want to wait an hour in your lobby while you try to oversell me on stuff i don’t need.
703 2018-12-05 22:54:00 Although true, none of that water is used up forever.  Cow's breath out H2O and urinate, and that water almost entirely gets recycled in the circle of life.  Damn i love my milk, especially in my coffee.  My concern is actually how it affects world oil prices, lol

705 2018-12-05 22:53:40 When the world is at a dangerous crossroads with the amount of carbon in our atmosphere, let’s make oil cheaper and sell more gas guzzling cars to help with the situation. I’m sure the next generations will remember you for the right reasons!
706 2018-12-05 22:53:38 Your actually proud of that POS cover?

Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund & the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies & is actively working to introduce American style Conservatism to Canada. It's is not news, it is propaganda.
707 2018-12-05 22:53:35 Using this oil to try to revive my hairline and praying every night it works...
708 2018-12-05 22:53:35 But what about if the bakery products contain palm oil or the flower you think can be picked is actually the one helps sustain a colony of bees? Is the distruction of the forests or death of a colony of bees worthwhile for the change of some terms
709 2018-12-05 22:53:19 Hopefully SA will figure out another way to make a living besides selling oil and slaughtering journalists. Their time is short and they know it.

711 2018-12-05 22:53:08 And he proclaimed North Sea oil was finished at ref1, and he's bidding for fracking big time, and he's away to benefit from latest oil reserves in Scottish waters, but hey what's our priority?
Mediawise WTF,
712 2018-12-05 22:53:04 Winston Churchill once said: “He who controls oil will win the next war.” 
Then along came #ClimateChange to throw a spanner in the works.

725 2018-12-05 22:51:52 The only way the world will get of the hydrocarbon drug is if it has to.  Burning coal and oil is bad for the world. Even a sixth grader knows that!     Apparently  not all of them.
726 2018-12-05 22:51:49 Oil is also fungible. You treat oil as a conflict mineral - that vow not to buy oil from nations with poor human rights records - watch how much oil price shoots through the sky. US oil production won’t matter.
727 2018-12-05 22:51:48 And some people focusing on the cost of the party like that's not just tip of the iceberg. There's unqualified people being hired, wild donations and missing oil in the hundreds of thousands of barrels. Tip of the iceberg. Smaddy and Dem friends fi lock up.
728 2018-12-05 22:51:39 IT WORSHIPS THE OIL OR IT GETS THE BONESAW AGAIN.

737 2018-12-05 22:50:59 The Red Army certainly had something to do with the defeat of the Germans. No winter gear hurt the Germans, bad weather, and the spreading of forces to get the oil fields in the south and try to get to Moscow were all a part of it. After Citadel in 43 it was over for the Germans
738 2018-12-05 22:50:47 Obviously! Only dignified old money oil baron strip club aficionados like J. Howard Marshall can be class acts!

746 2018-12-05 22:49:58 ICE vehicles would have long been uneconomical if we treated oil as a conflict mineral. Yet they were subsidized by multi trillion dollar wars to secure oil. Time is up.

755 2018-12-05 22:49:22 1/3 rd of petrol and gas of the planet is right in Qatar’s backyard. US is fracking for oil. That will end in disasters. Already earthquakes in the fracking areas are increasing. It is idiotic, but it all comes down to the incapacity of our ICE vehicles to burn anything else.
756 2018-12-05 22:49:21 Major issue. Don’t disagree with the idea. Hiwrver plastic is made from the gas on top of oilfields . We used to burn that off....but that polluted and destroys the atmosphere. So we actually need to stop producing oil.

784 2018-12-05 22:47:12 Don't Let Trump's EPA Gut Limits on Oil and Gas Pollution: Join 29,302 others! via @EnvDefenseFund
785 2018-12-05 22:47:08 40% of the oil used in the U.S. comes from Canada. We have so much oil and natural  gas that we're nearly independent from foreign oil. The hype about Saudi oil is just that, hysteria over nothing. The U.S. only gets 17% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
786 2018-12-05 22:46:57 That fossil fuel garbage is way out of hand. A ridiculous scam. With the amount of oil taken from the ground already, plus the enormous oil still in the ground, there would have to have been at least a million dinosaurs every square foot. Natures fuel, there’s plenty.

793 2018-12-05 22:46:09 But I have never seen oil come down that aggressively and not keep going down ..
794 2018-12-05 22:46:06 Clearly this is about over producing, to make up for the global low in oil prices. There has never been significant export access from Vancouver and so if the Trans Mountain, including the Sumas split are at or over capacity, then anything beyond that is over producing.
795 2018-12-05 22:45:45 5.2 billion worth of missing oil could've subsidized our manufacturing sector hence making it more competitive... but here we are instead
796 2018-12-05 22:45:43 And the industry can’t handle lower prices.   Don’t wait till the investment totally dries up and unemployment is rampant again in the oil fields of America ... Reduce taxes on gas  now - a quicker and better solution for the consumers

812 2018-12-05 22:44:20 Like American corporations that suck out their countries’ wealth and use and abuse the people in them ad infinitum..big pharma, big oil and military industrial complex the worst offenders..
813 2018-12-05 22:44:12 I thought the protests were over increasing oil prices as reported by some outlets? They wouldn't have attempted to mislead the public would they? Lol
814 2018-12-05 22:44:11 Have 9 more. It’s Hanukkah-a time to celebrate and consume fatty,delicious foods cooked d in OIL. Enjoy

816 2018-12-05 22:44:02 a nice man at Saje put the peppermint halo oil on the back of my neck and i think it was the best thing ive ever felt
817 2018-12-05 22:43:55 *ZANGANEH SAYS OIL PRICE BETWEEN $60-$70/BBL IS ACCEPTABLE: BBG. #OOTT

but not targeting a price of course
818 2018-12-05 22:43:51 See that's the thing, when it comes to power, sacrificing thousands of lives seems terrible to us but smart to higher ups. Look at the drug industry. They sell medications needed for cancer high. If you don't have the money, you die. Tbh, I think he would've did it for the oil

820 2018-12-05 22:43:44 Poached/shredded chicken thigh, chopped celery, light mayo, dijon mustard, olive oil - mine tends to be drier/crunchier/mustardier than most - almonds and apples if I have them, but absolutely no grapes, GRAPES CAN GTFO (sorry @PamelaGrow)
821 2018-12-05 22:43:43 Huh? Wasn't my intention to be "Racey" whatsoever  adatives to toiletries such as eucalyptus oil or mint are notorious for having adverse effects on sensitive areas of the body and can cause stinging, tingling and inflammation. People have different reactions. 
822 2018-12-05 22:43:21 Oil of cloves but you should get it checked out
823 2018-12-05 22:43:18 But that isn't the same as receiving money from the gas and oil industry. As far as being a 2020 candidate (I assume this is what started this), I don't know if he's the right candidate. But he's an attractive possibility considering that he received over 4 million voted in Texas

OIL PRICE BETWEEN $60-$70/BBL IS ACCEPTABLE: ZANGANEH
827 2018-12-05 22:43:08 And what happened during the oil boom? There was a commodities boom as well, and again (I'm mentioning leftists governments only for the sake of argument) Bolivia and Ecuador did not screw up so bad
828 2018-12-05 22:42:59 Finally we have an economist talking about the restructuring caused by US Oil supremacy.  US won WW2 by being the major oil producer and have not had this economic/foreign policy leverage since 1973.
829 2018-12-05 22:42:42 Actually the world does not need dirty money oil period.  Clean, renewable energies available but the oil lined pockets in our govt and greedy won’t allow it to happen.
830 2018-12-05 22:42:28 Hi Kerry. Great article - I find the whole concept of sustainable palm oil very confusing.

She went right back to her prep and soon the sound of crackling oil was heard in the kitchen. Cooking was a way to forget other things, like Negan's relations with other women and now the tumor eating away at >
832 2018-12-05 22:42:18 Oil spills also occur every day by nature. A lot more oil enters the ocean naturally than by human accidents. The accidental ones are more concentrated and get all the attention.
833 2018-12-05 22:42:16 I work in the oil fields.. do you work in the oil fields?

837 2018-12-05 22:41:58 Bush was no saint. Bush was an elitist who disliked Reagan. Bush was one term President who raised taxes, pushed NAFTA, responsible for war for oil interests. Reagan Republicans do not like Bush. Bush was no Mother Theresa. Bush rode coattails of Reagan, Bush was ungrateful.
838 2018-12-05 22:41:55 We don’t need a President who sanctions killing for oil
839 2018-12-05 22:41:50 おはようございます(*´ω｀*)
840 2018-12-05 22:41:46 Awesome!! Do you put anything on your face before or during or just the oil after? Did you try the oil it came with
841 2018-12-05 22:41:43 First of all we only get a small percentage of oil from that country even if we didn't the United States still no reason to give them thumbs up saying it's ok kill who u want but I forgot u got a lot of money from them maybe that's what u want to keep flowing instead of the oil
842 2018-12-05 22:41:40 I’m currently having a horrible shift & Nicole calls me into the back and literally puts 10 drops of Cbd oil in my mouth and told me to chill 
843 2018-12-05 22:41:38 I made my dukkah. I forget what I have made sometimes. I found some oil with chunks of a mysterious substance in it? Turns out it’s Parmesan. I really am a kind of hoarder/alchemist who dreams of having her own orchard/ vines whatever to create from.

Any Tim’s you say” the technology to manipulate gravity.

855 2018-12-05 22:40:44 Having researched this myself, it appears I asked you a loaded question. There are no comprehensive and credible links that prove this because it isn't true. Well, I guess partially true. Beto received donations from individuals, some of whom work for oil companies.

861 2018-12-05 22:40:02 it may have little impact on uk territorial emissions, (because it won’t increase consumption necessarily) even if it increases actual global emissions quite a lot (because there is extra oil in the world to be burned)
862 2018-12-05 22:40:01 Less oil = less reliance on foreign countries.
863 2018-12-05 22:39:58 Gorgeous...looks like an oil painting
864 2018-12-05 22:39:57 Its cool as hell, reminds me of gasoline or oil reflections

878 2018-12-05 22:39:08 "Lmao" - and I'm the 16 year old?!? And pal, try clearasil on that forehead. You could cook an egg on that thing with the amount of oil you got on there.

884 2018-12-05 22:38:39 Alberta has kept this country wealthy & never asked for anything!
Don’t think you’ll feel the pinch when the oil revenues dry up? Think again!
885 2018-12-05 22:38:39 We didn't think we could either though here Quebec is its own entity with special privileges... they get millions in equalization payments from Alberta , won't let a pimple line go through ( with the oil in which affords said payments) then they dump raw sewage into our waters
886 2018-12-05 22:38:34 #rre Its pretty simple really big cash pile growing daily and even if oil was smashed would cover cap in cash in two years. Has Arran development starting and FDP due has Dyas CPR due and very good chances of acquisitions. It will re rate when it re rates but re rate it will.
887 2018-12-05 22:38:31 Should have taken a pic of my lunch for the nood foodies, I actually cooked a healthy meal. Mediterranean chicken tenderloins grilled, garlic asparagus, also squash,zucchini, green and red peppers sauteed in butter and oil olive, topped with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.

894 2018-12-05 22:37:49 Oh but it does; the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) used when oil was discovered in the 1960s places the vast majority of reserves in Scottish waters.
Nice try little troll
895 2018-12-05 22:37:48 I was curious so I asked 20 girls in my Econ class y you need to change the oil in your car and top 5 answers were:  

1. “It makes that junt go faster”
2. “It’s like extra gas”
3. “My dad takes care of that”
4. “Is this a trick question?”
5. “I don’t know where the oil tank is”
896 2018-12-05 22:37:43 Bush Sr. was no saint. One term President, unpopular, elitist, raised taxes, started war in Persian Gulf for oil interests. Bush did not like Reagan, even though Bush rode Reagan's coattails to Whitehouse. Conservative Reagan Republicans don't like Bush. Stop rewriting history.
897 2018-12-05 22:37:42 Congrats to all and looking forward to working with you all in the future

899 2018-12-05 22:37:32 Agreed, but I think a revenue-neutral carbon tax of the sort working in British Columbia, Canada, will decide the issue. Drop all the subsidies inc those for coal and oil and let the least costly zero-carbon energy source win! I'm confident nuclear power would do well.
900 2018-12-05 22:37:30 Have you tried CBD oil? It helps me:)
901 2018-12-05 22:37:22 I wonder if she recalls HW going to Vietnam speculating oil just before the war started? Or, the time Halliburton made 39 billion in Iraq after Bush II lied about WMD and blew the fucking place to pieces? Or, if she recalls Waco? The kids burned to death there?
902 2018-12-05 22:37:11 They are counting oil wars, the hypothesis that many wars are fought due to the need to secure oil reserves.

905 2018-12-05 22:37:00 no, do your research. Processed palm oil is an unhealthy fat. There is also evidence that it counteracts appetite suppressants meaning that people eat more. Good for public health and obesity? No way!!!

924 2018-12-05 22:34:26 No no no..... 1 cup water 1 cup rice .... bring to the boil, turn it town, I normally add a tiny bit of oil, and tiny bit of salt.. was taught by the best 
925 2018-12-05 22:34:25 Hey boss, you screwed Saudi Arabia earlier by telling them that they needed to pump more oil because Iran was required to cut its production by 2 million barrels a day. Then you gave 8 countries an exemption. So now OPEC is going to screw us because you screwed them.
926 2018-12-05 22:34:12 Except me i work in the oil fields low prices stiffeling production. We need $70 oil.
927 2018-12-05 22:34:07 Zowel Midnight Oil als Joan Osborne hiervoor al heel lang niet gedraaid hoor. En zo af en toe moet je ook wat bekendere dingen draaien, om het voor een groot publiek herkenbaar en interessant te houden. Alleen maar krentjes uit de pap is voor (bijna) niemand leuk.
928 2018-12-05 22:34:06 If it was up to me, then I would have closed down all our oil&gas operations tomorrow.
929 2018-12-05 22:33:55 @VinnieTortorich any thoughts on avocado oil?
930 2018-12-05 22:33:53 If she really wanted to stand up to Trudeau she would cancel her carbon tax and shut the gas valves to eastern Canada. She’s a Trudeau ally. Together they killed the Alberta oil industry.
931 2018-12-05 22:33:49 Like there was no tomorrow. Like with the oil boom of the 1970s, Venezuela squandered it again, we came out for the second time in our history out of an oil boom heavily indebted
932 2018-12-05 22:33:36 The world may not want higher oil prices. Methinks it also does not want rising temperatures, rising sea levels, storms and the inferno of uncontrollable fires. But waste resources and they will come. Follow @realCharles1st for more wisdom.
933 2018-12-05 22:33:15 “Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!”

So are you implying that MBS get a pass on Khashoggi in exchange for oil.
934 2018-12-05 22:33:11 This is why studies have shown boxed cereal, baby foods, processed foods, things w/ corn syrup or corn oil as an ingredient & our wheat/bread products all test positive for glyphosate. We DON'T KNOW what such an accumulation in our systems is doing to us. We are guinea pigs.

936 2018-12-05 22:33:09 Palm oil is much more sustainable than other alternatives in terms of oil production per hectare area. Yes, palm oil is healthy to use if it’s consumed in a balanced diet... unless if you drink 3oz of it for breakfast then, no no
937 2018-12-05 22:33:06 The UD only gets 9 percent of oil from OPEC. We now produce enough oil to buy zero barrels. There is a hlut around the world. We t being held hostage by our need got this stuff. Time to wean world from it & save the planet. Earth first, oil & money last.

943 2018-12-05 22:32:35 Hopefully one with oil drippin on him, when Jesus comes he'll burn up a lot quicker that way. Don't listen to these mental cases, deceiving you with their snake oil books. They been around since beginning these false ones, making a buck off Jesus' name.
944 2018-12-05 22:32:31 I’m rereading Oil and Sugar, this fic is so underrated
945 2018-12-05 22:32:28 I too would prefer renewables but making the claim that the oil lobby is the only reason that renewables aren’t here isnt fair. Next thing you’ll be saying DS9 is better than TNG.
946 2018-12-05 22:32:14 Oil and gas lobbyists should have no seat at the climate change negotiating tables. Same deal with bought out politicians, both parties included.
947 2018-12-05 22:32:12 Yet when the oil companies want more money do these same people protest? Hell no but increase cost to fight climate change and they lose it?! Idiots

954 2018-12-05 22:31:36 You just publicly today of all days are comparing murder to not getting oil. How would you feel if that were your son? Just when i thought I could not be more disgusted with you as president - now I am just disgusted with you as a human being.  #ImpeachTrumpNow
955 2018-12-05 22:31:35 Along with the cultural icons I would prefer the name of Dr John Berry White.His contributions towards the development of healthcare,tea,oil,coal etc in the Northeast cannot be denied & it all started from Dibrugarh.
956 2018-12-05 22:31:19 I don't know not living there but my daughter does and she has told me that people she knows there who were once staunch Brits now see that they were wrong, the English only want the oil in Scottish waters, they disregard the people
957 2018-12-05 22:31:01 Also time to treat oil as a conflict mineral. Like cobalt. The human cost of oil is atleast 100x the human cost of cobalt. (Tesla has the least Cobalt in its batteries BTW)
958 2018-12-05 22:31:01 At Obama era US was one of the  biggest oil producer & free of importing oil. What happened? What changed?
959 2018-12-05 22:30:54 England will be in panic mode if Scotland runs out of oil 
960 2018-12-05 22:30:48 Actually, solar and wind power are cheaper.  Taxing oil to make it less attractive to buy is the smart thing to do.  Your statement is flawed.  Again.

967 2018-12-05 22:30:20 I don't think he has issues, I think he's got investments that have issues. He acts like someone that is highly leveraged into the oil industry and trying like hell to make as much money as possibly before the bottom falls out of it.

975 2018-12-05 22:29:51 okay, valid point right there,,,,
did u know oil is hot tho, you gotta be careful with it, it aint nothing to play with hmmm
976 2018-12-05 22:29:48 Oil industry is even bigger than coal.
And all the ancillary functions:
refining
pipelines
gasoline & fuel oil
lubricants
fertilizers
chemicals
plastics
Coincidentally, Koch industries is big in most (probably all) of these.
977 2018-12-05 22:29:46 How’s it been working? My boyfriend has been using my CBD oil and we originally bought shrooms for the purpose of mocrodosing, but then his sister ate them all without telling us. But do you think the mushrooms helped?
978 2018-12-05 22:29:39 it's all going to get digested sooner or later- he can handle this for now. 

no olive oil.
979 2018-12-05 22:29:21 What does Alberta do after separating...oil is still landlocked...
980 2018-12-05 22:29:16 Geez don't lie to us! The drop in price has NOTHING to do with the elimination of cap and trade and EVERYTHING to do with the lowered price of a barrel of oil. 

Your governments reputation is slipping already. 

People don't like to be lied to.... And this is a blatant lie.
981 2018-12-05 22:29:11 I’m soooooo lucky. My daughter @frantasbliss is allergic to all nuts and nut oil so I get all the bountys and snickers. What’s not to like. My favourites.

985 2018-12-05 22:28:47 We get the majority of our oil from Canada and oh yea, we produce it too.
986 2018-12-05 22:28:44 Petrojam did not provide evidence
that it analysed these factors and sources of
the unaccountable oil loss with a view to
better assess and address the problem.

990 2018-12-05 22:28:29 If he makes a couple more, his third Tweet will be accusing OPEC of flooding the market with oil and bankrupting his #MAGA allies in Texas and North Dakota, causing a huge financial crisis.
991 2018-12-05 22:28:00 these that gold dimes out of gold mines call your boss we hit the oil, i chill, i drill, calculating results ain’t never thrilled, ‘til i can pay my family’s bill and live real life that people thought was dreams.

Climate change is real it used to be called winter fall spring and summer.
1000 2018-12-05 22:27:44 To be fair the money you get from a football club is a tiny fraction of that from oil.
1001 2018-12-05 22:27:44 the smartest thing i did in my life (today) is coating cauliflower/boiled potatoes/carrots in olive oil and tossing them in the air fryer for 5 minutes. YUM
1002 2018-12-05 22:27:40 Look out for companies touting 'sustainable palm'. Palm oil is poorly regulated and there is no sustainability due to lack of regulation.

1004 2018-12-05 22:27:32 im pretty sure the only reason the govt doesnt want to switch to clean energy is bc were the top oil producer in the world so it gives us power over small countries who depend on our exports for energy but i mean like USA over the literal human species, right?

1006 2018-12-05 22:27:22 Stop the pricing of oil in USD would be a first step.

1011 2018-12-05 22:26:31 Snake oil salesman.
1012 2018-12-05 22:26:24 U Fu*king idiot. It does NOT raise the price of oil. Of we did things to wean us off of oil, I would go a long way to drop price. It is artificially inflated tm make OPEC rich & other oil producers rich. It is time to save the planet.
1013 2018-12-05 22:26:09 That’s sad, but think about our imperialist goals and oil interests.
1014 2018-12-05 22:25:57 I’m so glad that when I get overwhelmed from school and life I go turn on an oil diffuser now instead of chain smoking cigarettes
1015 2018-12-05 22:25:55 Honestly Vaseline is kind of a god send. As is softly exfoliating with sugar and oil. Just pour some coconut or whatever oil into your hand and put a small lunch of sugar in it and gently rub your lips then top with Vaseline after wiping off with a damp cloth.

1022 2018-12-05 22:25:22 So you're from Alberta and you can explain to me specifically why oil prices dropped so much. Oh and if you could also let me know why globally oil prices have dropped that would be nice as well. Because I have an understanding of why but apparently it's the liberals fault.
1023 2018-12-05 22:25:20 Ameen
1024 2018-12-05 22:24:53 We don’t need their oil, really!
1025 2018-12-05 22:24:42 Things such as Shea butter, beeswax, coconut oil, jojoba oil, etc. and then top it with a Vaseline or something similar to act as a barrier to keep that ‘sinking in’ moisture safe and on your lips longer. Hope that made any kind of sense 2/2

1030 2018-12-05 22:23:45 Forget the propaganda. Which of Hillary Clinton's actual policies/platforms were truly bad for the 99%? She had good policies that would help the little guy, if only people, and especially the press, had paid attention instead of being mesmerized 24/7 by a snake oil salesman.
1031 2018-12-05 22:23:44 Come to my new business where I pipe cryo-cooled CBD bone broth into your fascia through acupuncture needles and implant activated fish oil lubricated power crystal suppositories into your anal canal
1032 2018-12-05 22:23:38 On dat fresh oil.
1033 2018-12-05 22:23:33 I think it tastes better than Crisco, which is what I grew up using. There's not a pronounced coconut taste or anything, just a nice crisp-around-the-edges richness.

I keep my flour in the freezer, so that does help. Coconut oil goes liquid more easily than butter or Crisco.
1034 2018-12-05 22:23:33 I’m with tomatoes fairy’s guts?!?! you thing Virgin olive oil from?
1035 2018-12-05 22:23:28 I was waiting my turn at a super cuts the other day n heard a stylist mention something to their man customer about applying beard oil. I feel like I have so many questions about beard maintenance now.
1036 2018-12-05 22:23:17 so yesterday my co worker was telling me how dry her skin be. i told her i moisturize my body with coconut oil. she said, “cookie oil?” i busted out laughing LOL. wth.
1037 2018-12-05 22:23:11 Most of the times it seems that a cut of a minimum 1mbd moves the oil market. Anything below that doesn’t seem to have a great effect.
1038 2018-12-05 22:23:04 Sure, I can enlighten you.

1039 2018-12-05 22:23:03 Sure....you...would like to see oil prices stay down....oil ( a lifeline for everyone) just like medicine is. When someone has the world by the balls that means they have absolute power over everyone, why would a businessman like yourself talk about taking losses and being fair

1044 2018-12-05 22:22:53 Capitalistpocene is more accurate.  Oil companies knew burning petroleum whould change climate but protected profits and shut up for example.
1045 2018-12-05 22:22:51 Why when I talk to any female they car either in the shop or ain’t gotta oil change? I might be trippin
1046 2018-12-05 22:22:49 got the day off so I Wanted to get an oil change, see the chiropractor, hit the post office, and buy some new b-ball shoes.
-never got a call back to take in my truck 
-chiropractor was booked even tho their pamphlet says walk ins
-post office is closed 
-didn’t have my size 
1047 2018-12-05 22:22:33 Science? You've offered a second hand "internet fact". Not science.

Vegans claim for example that switching to a plant based diet would be better for the planet. It would take less space to grow all the food. Except palm oil plantations are wiping out Orangutans. Doesn't add up.

1051 2018-12-05 22:21:44 
1052 2018-12-05 22:21:44 I kinda think it's true Oil is one of the most precious things in the world and I wouldn't doubt for a second that politicians would sacrifice that many lives.
1053 2018-12-05 22:21:43 are the toner and powder for makeup reasons tho bc I def don't wanna do that daily, I mostly wanna keep it clean and just reduce oil/talg
1054 2018-12-05 22:21:42 Can't wait for when you get to baby oil.
1055 2018-12-05 22:21:33 Govts must actively pursue alternate energy sources and stop oil dependency. Sun light,water,air and even vacuum energy should be actively pursued.
1056 2018-12-05 22:21:32 Fluke is as smooth as canola oil on a Mississippi bayou!!!!!
1057 2018-12-05 22:21:32 Or if the tires would inflate themselves. Or if the truck would call a tech whenever the oil gets low.

Climate is driven by sun, not harmless vital gas CO2. Enough oil and gas for 200years. Foundation of our civilisation. Greens are so destructive.

1067 2018-12-05 22:20:48 Good job, Mr President. Hope you can defeat the high oil prices, high housing prices in any other country else.

1069 2018-12-05 22:20:28 Lentils w. rice fits bill, but yr challenge is a good oil to saute onion -trad dals use butter. Olive has low smoke point -not great, I like peanut, walnut, or (sorry dude) avocado oil. If you want to add flavor mix in a little coconut oil at end. Roast squash, steam kale sides.

1076 2018-12-05 22:19:57 @NicolleDWallace  is head and shoulders above @IngrahamAngle in all matters of credibility, intellect, and honesty. Ingraham is somewhat less credible than a snake oil salesman but infinitely more credible than @seanhannity.  Fox non news should be proud.
1077 2018-12-05 22:19:49 Oh Donald...Qatar is leaving OPEC and Iraq may follow soon. Saudi will have to pump just to stay afloat... Iran will increase capacity.. so.. do not worry.. the price of oil will drop... not increase.
1078 2018-12-05 22:19:48 The chart i posted was for Canada. Canadians need to understand the contribution of oil and gas to the national economy.
1079 2018-12-05 22:19:48 Flow of oil by OPEC also depends on their economic compositions. These countries will also put their nations first to generate wealth for themselves.
1080 2018-12-05 22:19:41 I can’t recall if it is policy, law or other, but I read in the last month that OPEC’s oil contracts are written in USD$ - Was that true? And does or will Europe’s effort change that drafting requirement/policy?
1081 2018-12-05 22:19:40 Yeah, I think even if the donations were all 100 percent verified to have come from mega super oil PACs they wouldn't care. They would still be screaming about Bernie Sanders.
1082 2018-12-05 22:19:29 Does tissue paper count as dressed?
1083 2018-12-05 22:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
1084 2018-12-05 22:19:19 payments suck & insurance & gas & oil changes & all that :/ if i lived in a big city i honestly wouldn’t even get one
1085 2018-12-05 22:19:16 It’s more to do with fact they are in single market and participate in a lot of European research projects. But actually Scotland is very like Norway and there is a lot of working togethe on the oil industry
1086 2018-12-05 22:19:14 Understandable. Would CBD oil help?
1087 2018-12-05 22:19:12 We have our own oil we dont need OPEC so why are we relying in OPEC still. I thought you were going to open our oil fields.

Increíble decir algo así, apoyandose en rayitas, sin aportar nada más...

También comparó su caída con el oil, invento el petropapel en un rato...

1091 2018-12-05 22:18:47 As long as you keep outlining the debate being between Ottawa and Alberta (when both are on the same page regarding oil pipelines - they're pro) post-IPCC report, you're doing it wrong.
1092 2018-12-05 22:18:46 Socialism is the label of one type of political pressure. If you can't apply the concepts and principles of socialism to solving political issues and blame oil, drug, religious, and other corruptions chiefly on a label for a government, then you're not academic
1093 2018-12-05 22:18:41 u warned try the spirit!!!!! test all told u esp.these end day as false hooded ones say only as r increasin)- don't know as word of God-I'LL SHOW U EXACTLY WHAT ONLY JESUS BE PUTTING ANY OF HIS OIL ON ONE NOT ANY ON FEET TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER-

1095 2018-12-05 22:18:05 No he doesn’t. He just wants to profiteer from the imminent crash. These people are not idiot, they’re just snake oil salesmen and charlatans.
1096 2018-12-05 22:18:01 Too late price of oil has gone up per barrel today. Besides America doesn't import much oil from open anymore as canada supplies more by far

1099 2018-12-05 22:17:56 Research GH
Media says he's all compassion

He was one term for a reason
Scandals
Lied and raised taxes
Got us in Middle a east affairs we didn't need to be in
All to help his oil buddies

I lived it
He wasn't popular when he left office for a reason

Funerals are whitewashed
1100 2018-12-05 22:17:54 As a Canadian outside Alberta , I support you ! I am embarrassed by Trudeau amd his liberal’s reckless decisions on your oil industry!
1101 2018-12-05 22:17:51 oh, neat! Does that affect the flavor at all? I've never worked with coconut oil.
1102 2018-12-05 22:17:44 Just in case you don't know, Norway have a population of 5 millions. But Norway it's sitting on top of some trillions in  natural resources of oil and gas. 95% of Norway exports it's energy: oil, gas, electricity...
     UK going to get a Norway+ deal ...err ...NEVER.
1103 2018-12-05 22:17:33 The price of oil needs to be higher for a lot of countries including the US.  If you want cheaper gas, then put pressure on the refining end, they are the ones making the money.  $65-$70 is good for the industry and keeps it healthy.  It keeps steel, auto, and other 3rd services

1107 2018-12-05 22:17:16 Lost in this conversation is that Russia's GDP is 10% of ours and their budget is 60+% oil dependent. Ignore Putin.
1108 2018-12-05 22:17:11 Rehydrated soy protein, laxatives, coconut oil, wheat, barley, maltodextrin (look out diabetics), cultured dextrose, nuts & veg produced in a factory is not meat, so should not be on the Beef shelf.
1109 2018-12-05 22:17:01 Time to bring out the engines that run on water. Put them into production. Stanley Meyers invented one of the first and they killed him for it but there's several now. Time to stop drilling for so much oil. We need those engines. Time to stop pretending they don't exist.
1110 2018-12-05 22:16:45 Under $2 on the reservation. Local has places haven't lowered their prices even tho oil price has dropped. They're making extra money for themselves. Not rocket science.
1111 2018-12-05 22:16:31 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
1112 2018-12-05 22:16:22 If you changing the oil every 2-3 months it shouldn’t really be that big of a difference unless you have a heavy foot. Just pick up on the maintenance and you should be solid
1113 2018-12-05 22:16:21 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
1114 2018-12-05 22:16:09 This is an extraordinary example of Christian superemists. That tribe lived very well w/o Christian snake oil. He viewed them as inferior, and paid the price.
1115 2018-12-05 22:15:56  #YouHateThis  RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
1116 2018-12-05 22:15:46 2/ It achieved that goal only with the help of the ABNDP government via the commitment of royalties-in-kind. As for Saudi imports, Irving made a point of saying that it would not feel obliged to abandon those in favour of refining EE oil arriving at its planned terminal.
1117 2018-12-05 22:15:43 How will dropping the 2C target help in reducing oil burning to zero?
1118 2018-12-05 22:15:37 Pointing out Johnstone's opportunistic racism is not pleasurable, but it's necessary because she's a snake oil saleswoman. I hardly "make a name" for that or profit in any way. I'm not the one swindling hundreds to pay for a Patreon account, am I now?
Sorry you fell for a con job

1125 2018-12-05 22:14:52 Yes! Like the tea tree oil already bad enough. Y’all want me to put vinegar on my carpet too.
1126 2018-12-05 22:14:44 The Canadian Oil Industry contributes far more to GDP than the Ontario auto industry.
There were 180,000 layoffs.
There are mortgages failing, marriages ending and businesses collapsing. 
Thank heavens the BOC doesn't see any effect!
I guess we won't be missed
bcz it's coming!
1127 2018-12-05 22:14:42 Reminds me of Saddam Hussein setting all the oil wells on fire as he retreated from Kuwait.
1128 2018-12-05 22:14:38 All these anti oil people are hypocrites. You all preach a green economy and say how bad oil is. But you don't even realize that every single thing we have is because of the miracle of oil. Try forming your own opinion instead of the one thats fed to you. #oilislife
1129 2018-12-05 22:14:35 She’s also a @younglivingeo  young living essential oil distributor... wonder what they think of her position on the disabled....
1130 2018-12-05 22:14:33 They keep sanctioning countries too, China buying Russian oil with yuan
1131 2018-12-05 22:14:30 How about we start focusing more on developing/using alternative energy sources so we are not so dependent on oil, foreign or otherwise.
1132 2018-12-05 22:14:28 You miss the point: The planet needs!!! higher oil prices!
1133 2018-12-05 22:14:25 Hey! I got an idea! If we make a major push to switch to renewable resources then demand for oil will go down and so will oil prices! Some say it's good for the environment. Let's DO this, right?  #TrumpIsAnIdiot
1134 2018-12-05 22:14:14 Lol same. I use mattifying lotion for that. I personally use burt bees or no7 cleansers because they help clean your skin and help with oil control
1135 2018-12-05 22:14:07 Chickpeas tossed in olive oil and spices and oven-baked, paired with a steamed sweet potato. Black bean chili where you just chop veggies and dump the ingredients in a pot and cook. Possibly paired with rice.

1140 2018-12-05 22:13:55 I am a Texan who’s hubs was a crane operator. Beto $50. My neighb a mgr at a Murphy oil conv store donated Beto $25.  My brother an assist at a refinery. Donated $100. We r all oil & gas employees in TX 1 of biggest employers in state. U r trying to make a scandal. despicable
1141 2018-12-05 22:13:45 Meticulously developed? You've been over here spouting your opinion that's not more informed than anyone else reading it. Selling yourself as some sort of "in the know" or "clairvoyant" person is pretty dishonest. But you've got snake oil... err... books to sell.
1142 2018-12-05 22:13:42 Not a meal, but for a side dish you cannot go wrong with mixed root vegetables, peeled and chopped into roughly 2" cubes, roasted with a little olive oil and sea salt until tender.
1143 2018-12-05 22:13:37 "The Special Committee would just be bureaucracy that would get in the way..." - of what? Is there another committee doing something?

"Who are the oil & gas that give to me? They hate me." - Great, then you have nothing to lose by pledging not to take their money.

1145 2018-12-05 22:13:17 "Partitioning Poland, home of 3 million Jews, to a genocidal anti-Semitic maniac is good, actually. Same with exchanging political prisoners and selling oil and wheat to the Nazi war machine."
1146 2018-12-05 22:13:15 and, fun fact, for vertically integrated companies like Exxon they often make more money from gas station stores then from selling gas.

Oil is a really low-margin business
1147 2018-12-05 22:13:15 Holy Land makes THE best hummus! One of the only brands that uses Olive Oil. A lot of others use Canola or Soybean Oil, blerg.
1148 2018-12-05 22:13:12 Try to make a little bit of sense. You expect the govt to pay a debt of that magnitude in 3 yrs, with all the massive expenditures and borrowings while crude oil prices is nose diving.  
Someone should just collect that your phone.
1149 2018-12-05 22:13:10 That's what I plan to do...

1159 2018-12-05 22:11:54 Stopped to get the oil change after all lol rather get it over with  they wasn’t busy yess
1160 2018-12-05 22:11:45 It seem like I haven’t gotten an oil change in 6 months but in reality it’s only been 2 months.
1161 2018-12-05 22:11:44 Electronics, tires, water, hydro, heating & vehicle fuels, household garbage, even oil filters are taxed . Who's NOT PAYING FOR POLLUTION??

1163 2018-12-05 22:11:25 Remember a few years ago when people were chanting about data being the new oil and some of us were like, wait, here are reasons this is bad, and no one listened? It’s good people are listening now about that, but also try listening to people raising concerns *now*
1164 2018-12-05 22:11:20 おはよ……ぼくはおねむだよ……
1165 2018-12-05 22:11:17 I think we need to talk about your TV or camera tbh. Because that looks like a shit oil painting.
1166 2018-12-05 22:11:08 from oil executives is no biggy, that seems incredibly foolish, but it's your right, but it's also important that people have a chance to hear about that and make up their own minds. 

Anyone who takes climate change seriously probably won't see it well, and that's on Beto.
1167 2018-12-05 22:11:04 Dat pink oil, you already know.

1177 2018-12-05 22:10:21 That's really cool!

1180 2018-12-05 22:10:15 The US has cut Corp tax rates, boosted tariffs and started exporting oil.  When 25% of GDP makes changes like this, the world feels it.  Riots in France, turmoil in Saudi Arabia are partly caused by the US removing what were effectively subsidies to global growth.
1181 2018-12-05 22:10:14 it would be a crisis if it were Bombardier or a auto manufacturer losing all those jobs and investments ... oh ya ... I forgot,  they react real fast when one of them Going down. And it's only a fraction of the economy that Oil is. Wake up Canada!

1187 2018-12-05 22:09:43 In the event no one told you, we don't get our oil from OPEC, just a fraction.
1188 2018-12-05 22:09:32 Not according to @gorbalsgal. She seems to think that having oil under the ocean bed will somehow benefit us - "Needn't be used to have value" she says. It only has value if produced and sold though. Entirely relevant to her constitutional argument which was inherently flawed.
1189 2018-12-05 22:09:25 2020 will have a lot of democrats running for the candidate of each major donor class.

1197 2018-12-05 22:08:50 The @realDonaldTrump keeep pushing for reducing the price of oil. This is a smart move for the US.
1198 2018-12-05 22:08:50 There should always be an oil industry. Reusable plastics and many more uses you haven't thought of yet. But not for burning and making climate change worse. Btw am I a trailer too ?
1199 2018-12-05 22:08:50 Do you think the big bosses are going to say fair cop, we'll take it out of our bonuses..... or do you think they'll just put the price of oil up by that amount and the consumer will end up paying it anyway?
1200 2018-12-05 22:08:47 Bet! go ahead and swap it for coconut oil

lol
1204 2018-12-05 22:08:06 Damn pipeline ships about 300k barrels of oil a day, no way you can make any money off of that.
1205 2018-12-05 22:08:05 Intrinsically safe (idiot proof) modern reactor designs would help in this regard. But we are conditioned to think nuclear risk is way beyond anything else.  I'm sure handling a few thousand tons of fuel oil isn't without its potential risks too. Rational risk assessments req'd!
1206 2018-12-05 22:08:05 That he is a liar everyone knows that. But people cannot be so foolish to blindly follow him. And KSA cannot be influenced by him any more. Just today Trump was tweeting again about keeping oil low.

1208 2018-12-05 22:07:57 Not really. Most places have fake processed chicken and tons of additives and nasty shit in them. Just cuz ur brain gets a taste of MSG and you THINK it’s good, doesn’t mean it’s actually high quality food. I’m a vegetarian now but chick fil a actually uses good ingredients/oil.
1209 2018-12-05 22:07:49 @JeromyYYC Just read Rick Bell’s article and wanted to say “good work Jeromy!”  As a former Calgarian now living in Edmonton, keep up the good fight. We need more councillors like you fighting this ‘war’ against Oil and Alberta. I wish Edmonton Council would get on board.
1210 2018-12-05 22:07:45 going to hop on the free oil change.

1213 2018-12-05 22:07:19 Wouldn't reducing the overall amount of oil up for grabs help the cause then
1214 2018-12-05 22:07:16 Hot yam n oil.
1215 2018-12-05 22:07:02 the Democrats want higher oil prices, higher taxes for all, less of everything for all, more laws and control, this way we can all be equal (sheep of course) that have just the necessary things!  I personally want completely the opposite
1216 2018-12-05 22:06:59 @YoungOGeezus_ wya with the black seed oil ?
1217 2018-12-05 22:06:41 2 Biggie. Figured I'd go all out and get the oil changed too.
1218 2018-12-05 22:06:37 We are not able to stop #climatechange. The least thing should be not to leave a deadly mess for those organisms surving it. Plans are needed to shut down nuclear plants, chemical factories, oil fields by time in a safe way.
1219 2018-12-05 22:06:29 ↑笑う
1220 2018-12-05 22:06:20 You and Minister Sohi are just full of platitudes and BS!  If you were real Canadians, you would withdraw Bill C-69 immediately; and proactively work to support #EnergyEast to eliminate tankers of imported oil & create 000's of Cdn jobs!
1221 2018-12-05 22:06:20 Worried DT willl go after Iran in an attempt to save his presidency. I'm sure they want Iranian oil n don't want Iranian selling it, only solution, topple Iran. That's why DT needs SA bc RU will be protecting Iran, right? Kim-Un is moving munitions around too. Dangerous times. 
1222 2018-12-05 22:06:18 Obama:  "Those low oil prices ... thank me"

There's your egomaniacal lying nuthatch right there!
1223 2018-12-05 22:06:16 Correct, no one implied otherwise.  Oil is part of our energy sector. On the topic of arrogance revert back to your tweet on Alberta children and education and you've got the best example of it in this conversation. Looking in a mirror will give you a similar view.
1224 2018-12-05 22:06:05 I like how we can't relate to 1 day's worth of oil lasting 8 days, so people have to relate it to cellphone charge instead. Next, Judas will take 30 bitcoins sent to his digital wallet for doxxing Jesus.
1225 2018-12-05 22:06:03 No real Americans care or should care about Khashoggi. Whole Middle East is a mess. What do you expect from these backward savages. If not for oil, we would not bother with them.
1226 2018-12-05 22:05:47 Better question is, why does the BE cost seem to drop everytime the price of oil drops?

1228 2018-12-05 22:05:40 Idea: Lower the oil subsidies AND lower the gass tax.  Lowering the gas tax lowers taxes on the poor. Lowering the oil subsidies will be a disincentive for investments in oil extraction and refinement. Move the money from Fossil fuel to infrastructure spending!

1231 2018-12-05 22:05:25 But not above profit, for God Sakes he was in Oil & Gas and so were virtually of his donors. What year did Big Oil & Gas know about the impact of Climate Change???
1232 2018-12-05 22:05:19 President Donald Trump Wednesday called on OPEC and its allies not to cut Crude Oil production next year, saying it would trigger higher prices worldwide Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see or need, higher oil prices
1233 2018-12-05 22:05:18 @CBCHereandNow Australian amd Israeli /Palestian olive oils are my faves. I get Palestinian olive oil in Kensington Mrkt on Augusta near Baldwin at the natural foods
1234 2018-12-05 22:05:00 OPEC reportedly discussed cutting output around 800-900K barrels/day at their meeting earlier

1235 2018-12-05 22:04:55 #UnitedNations announced that it needs roughly $8 billion for 2019 to deal with the #humanitarian impact of #global conflicts—the bulk of those funds will be required to deal with #Yemen. Many ask why are the #oil rich #Gulf States, led by #SaudiArabia, not on the hook for this?
1236 2018-12-05 22:04:41 Roasted chickpea and cauliflower tacos - season then and toss with oil then bake. Soft corn tortilla. Maybe some pickled onions, salsa, cilantro, avocado, etc. 
1237 2018-12-05 22:04:41 Coconut oil does such amazing things, its love to win x
1238 2018-12-05 22:04:39 We are going to take him to the vet because he has been having more severe aggression issues so we are going to see what kind of options we have. CBD oil is an option we’ve been looking into though.
1239 2018-12-05 22:04:32 A state controlled oil industry, or any "private" industry is alien to this American
1240 2018-12-05 22:04:31 Sorry your oil change took longer than expected, Chris.  Did you talk to your service advisor about it yet?
1241 2018-12-05 22:04:26 من خودم میخام اینو امتحان کنم، نتیجه داد خبرتون میکنم
Tea tree oil
شامپوهای حاوی این هست، خودتون هم میتونید جداگانه بخرید و به شامپوتون اضافه کنید. خیلی بودار و تنده. نمیدونم ایران هست یانه؟
1242 2018-12-05 22:04:21 But Feinsteine can thank Obama. Last week Obama bragged that it's not Trump, it's me, who is responsible for the biggest increase in US oil production by any President. In deed, US oil production increased by 9% over Obama's 8 years, more than any POTUS.
1243 2018-12-05 22:03:57 If baby it’s cold outside offends you, put CBD oil on it
1244 2018-12-05 22:03:57 Gas running out fast is a sign you need a oil change?
1245 2018-12-05 22:03:51 Make sure you get the high fat...
Look up coconut oil pulling too. More natural way to whiten that gorgeous smile :)
1246 2018-12-05 22:03:48 Even as una Dey find oil like this? Wawu
1247 2018-12-05 22:03:41 Shame on you ! Nutella = oil palm = monkey's Killer
1248 2018-12-05 22:03:34 @WBrettWilson @JustinTrudeau @BradWall306 makes much more sense to ship oil from the other side of the world on a cargo ship that burns tons per hour (not gallons per hour) of bunker fuel that emits cancer and asthma causing pollutants equivalent to 50 million cars per year.
1249 2018-12-05 22:03:25 That’s motor oil
1250 2018-12-05 22:03:21 SMART POTUS would FOCUS on Wind, Sun power NOT Oil since oil Polluting Earth

But Trump like all OLD WEALTHY REPUBLICANS Only want OIL used, They Become RICHER while DESTROYING AIR We Breath Mainly DESTROYING the
 

SAVE ImPeach TRUMP
1251 2018-12-05 22:03:15 I done put so much oil on my edges they might slide out 
1252 2018-12-05 22:03:00 This oil belongs to Syria.   They should sue whatever “actors” are stealing it.
1253 2018-12-05 22:02:49 All up in the oil spot....nigga pelle pelle shirt fucked off
1254 2018-12-05 22:02:42 If a Nations borders are on a shoreline, in International Laws that Nation if attacked has every legal right to cut off access and exits along that waterway. That would include the Persian Gulf and the narrow Strait which exposes all Oil Tankers squeezing into that area.
1255 2018-12-05 22:02:22 Coconut Oil.
1256 2018-12-05 22:02:21 I don't think any of those individuals voted for him over Cruz because of his stance on oil
1257 2018-12-05 22:02:18 C: To be fair, there has been reference to it made on 205, so there merging of characters is slowly materialising.

There have been many instances of an oil & water combination in wrestling, so don't have an issue. 

At the end of day, both still seem like dick humour to me.
1258 2018-12-05 22:02:15 USA is once more dropping the ball. Russia owns the majority of the gas fields in Venezuela! China owns all the oil companies, gold mines and  the electric grid! Where? In Venezuela!!!!!
1259 2018-12-05 22:02:06 Since the prime minster take over the profiler the oil price keep passing on to the consumer
1260 2018-12-05 22:01:56 "Potatoes, especially those dunked and cooked in hot oil, have been linked to obesity, diabetes and heart disease." Erm fuck off you're just jealous potatoes are more fabulous than you
1261 2018-12-05 22:01:54 America is the # 1 producer in the world, we dictate our own oil production and prices, so tell BS to FO we don’t need his country’s oil or money for arms that are used to kill children in Yemen.  Stop trying to line your own pockets at US expense.
1262 2018-12-05 22:01:53 朝起きるためにアラーム変えてOIL KINGにしたらオタクのコールにビビって目が覚めた。これオススメ
1263 2018-12-05 22:01:51 Holiday shopping is upon us! The Barn is a one stop shop for gifts and stocking stuffers! We have goat milk lotions and soy candles, wine stave design products, local olive oil and honey, and those special seasonings ! Think local this holiday season! #glaumeggranch #glaumbarn
1264 2018-12-05 22:01:47 Work on basic English please. Keeping oil flows. Maybe a better option would have been keeping oil flowing as in not restricted. Pretty sad the POTUS sucks at English and grammar.
1265 2018-12-05 22:01:45 "ur grand-pappy, extolled the virtues of whale oil!"  He probably did before cheap and plentiful kerosene came along to smash the market for it!  (Coal saved our forests too!)
1266 2018-12-05 22:01:44 time for an oil change 
1267 2018-12-05 22:01:43 Casseroles are great for adding extra fat while providing flavor. I notice you didn’t mention any dead meat? Either way ground beef and steak are my go tos for dinners. Make sure you are using real butter whenever cooking. Coconut oil is also really great amazing benefits
1268 2018-12-05 22:01:34 @Facebook is the digital version of a giant oil company. No one really likes them except their own C-level team and some investors.
1269 2018-12-05 22:01:31 What about your hidden oil?
1270 2018-12-05 22:01:10 you need help
1271 2018-12-05 22:01:00 <•><•>
1272 2018-12-05 22:00:59 I saw the first image and immediately thought of the eggs in all that olive oil.    The bread, broken. The silence: so perfect.
1273 2018-12-05 22:00:58 Yeah, and unbuy that tank.
1274 2018-12-05 22:00:55 2019 wishlist:
• Get rid of Mourinho 
• Appoint Jardim AND a DoF
• Convince the Glazers to sell to oil merchants
1275 2018-12-05 22:00:46 December 05, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1276 2018-12-05 22:00:43 Ban-de-sole sunblock tube in the old '78 Dodge Colt. Has to be well over 2 decades old. Ran when parked over two decades ago with over 320k miles on it. It didn't even burn oil. It needed a new suspension back then. Struts, shocks, springs and all. Not a problem, but...

1280 2018-12-05 22:00:18 perhaps trump is pissed off the oil is going there and not the the USA
1281 2018-12-05 22:00:02 It wasn’t on Duma, it was on the “White House” (russian government). You don’t mention 30m people who live for less than 110$ as well. I believe that in those conditions he did mostly right. What we see now in Putin’s Russia after 12 years of prosperity and high oil prices?
1282 2018-12-05 22:00:02 - honey, oats, egg whites 
-  avocado, milk, oats
-  banana, coffee, milk
- lemon juice, yoghurt, cinnamon 
-  coconut oil, banana, coffee
1283 2018-12-05 21:59:57 ask those feet if they could change my oil in my car next 
1284 2018-12-05 21:59:50 Hey @joshduhamel the world is moving to #stopextremeextraction are you in oil’s pocket or will you be a champion for your state?
1285 2018-12-05 21:59:47 Trump so bad, y’all don’t forgot how bad the Bushes’ were 

The First Bush pushed drugs into the hood

The Second Bush planned 9/11 and got America at war with the Middle East over oil
1286 2018-12-05 21:59:45 Compare to the number of oil spills and coal mine accidents.
1287 2018-12-05 21:59:40 May his God lay him upon his spender of dollar bills. And cleanse his begotten Son in eternal oil.
1288 2018-12-05 21:59:34 Oil filter for l200
1289 2018-12-05 21:59:33 That's electrical production  - a lot of heating comes from volcanic sources, and they still use a lot of fuel oil
1290 2018-12-05 21:59:32 The beard oil @mcmahanne88 @Sweeptoday #badassbeardcare
1291 2018-12-05 21:59:29 What an idiotic statement. We have plenty of oil
1292 2018-12-05 21:59:29 Awesome!!! I loveeeeee tartes oil. I’ve heard that microneedling is good for acne
1293 2018-12-05 21:59:28 COCONUT OIL
1294 2018-12-05 21:59:28 This match na trash,but Chelsea loss has compensated for it.
1295 2018-12-05 21:59:22 What effect do they put on the US sanctions for the way things are? Do they consider the US wants the worlds largest OIL reserves and this is what it really boils down to? Drop the US sanctions and see the effects then.
1296 2018-12-05 21:59:20 Open our domestic wells and tell them to shove it. RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
1297 2018-12-05 21:59:07 Poor Provincial Government, higher taxes, carbon tax, high regulatory, but mostly Federally Canada has adopted an anti oil policy #albertaseparation
1298 2018-12-05 21:59:02 you people and your oil issues
1299 2018-12-05 21:58:51 My wife has severe Wilson's Disease with a lot of chronic pain and used CBD oil a lot.  Sure beats liver-killing Tylenol and nasty pharmaceuticals!
1300 2018-12-05 21:58:46 Saudi Oil Money. Follow the Money.
1301 2018-12-05 21:58:42 What happened to being self sufficient? So much for that idea huh? We shouldn’t buy “blood oil” from your Saudi pal, Sheik Bonesaw anyway, he’s about as vicious as you are stupid! It’s unbecoming watching an American “President” bow down to, cower, and even salute a dictator.....
1302 2018-12-05 21:58:40 #PennState @KatyMBarlow successfully defends her PhD thesis on restoration of unconventional gas and oil development on #WorldSoilDay2018
1303 2018-12-05 21:58:38 The planet needs to turn to renewable energy sources & turn away from the Greedy big oil & coal profiteers (Koch Bros).Greenhouse gases will eventually snuff out most life on earth; including the human race! 99% of scientists agree: we are at a crucial apex to save life on Earth!
1304 2018-12-05 21:58:33 With out oil our civilization ceases to exist and will resemble Somalia. Being under the governance of street gangs and warloards isnt much of a future for your kids to look forwsrd to.
1305 2018-12-05 21:58:28 Canadian gov. is cutting oil production in Alberta by 9% come January 1st. That's 325,000 barrels/day. Not good.
1306 2018-12-05 21:58:23 Hi Chigrl, sorry for asking too much questions last week. Will turn the volume down! But would u like to share your oil chart one more time before Opec Friday? Do u still see the right chart playing out? Sunday Gap fill first and after that they announce something bullish oil?
1307 2018-12-05 21:58:19 I’ll be putting in a DoTerra essential oil order this weekend if anyone needs anything
1308 2018-12-05 21:58:08 coconut oil for Yogi's fur~
1309 2018-12-05 21:58:08 That was partially the reason they fought like cats and dogs and mixed like oil and water. And when push came to shove?

They would defend what was theirs and take what they needed.
1310 2018-12-05 21:58:08 No doubt. That and the fact that Deutsche Bank will give him a discount for every hundred million dollars their oil investments go up.
1311 2018-12-05 21:58:05 This alabaster jar is all I have of worth
I break it at Your feet, Lord, it's less than You deserve
You're far more beautiful, more precious than the oil
The sum of my desires and the fullness of my joy
Like You spilled Your blood, I spill my heart
As an offering to my King

1312 2018-12-05 21:57:53 Posting a lying article from the BBC?  Get a clue will you? Syria went to hell after Obama intervened by helping the terrorists to go to war with Assad. Why? Because he was the obstacle in allowing a new oil and gas pipeline into Europe. Obama sent money, guns, ammo, vehicles.
1313 2018-12-05 21:57:48 The 10 virgins and 5 enter in 
5 go get more oil they ran out
Matt 25: 1-13

Warning upon warnings
In the scriptures 
And many will  coddle  you

 Jesus said to the 5 virgins when they returned I don’t know you
  Some how they believed a lie
 They where waiting with the wise
1314 2018-12-05 21:57:46 I dont have either. Considering putting cooking oil on so it gets greasy andn gross and turns back into a spot 
1315 2018-12-05 21:57:24 I want the oil one
1316 2018-12-05 21:57:22 なんか天気悪いし
あーやだやだ
1317 2018-12-05 21:56:46 My 17-year-old self would like to share his opinion: 
"Thank you Mr. Bush for visiting Los Roques National Park quite often and pushing global oil prices up but you're still a warmonger."
1318 2018-12-05 21:56:41 Muslim and GOP is the same sentence. Smh! That's like water and oil.
1319 2018-12-05 21:56:34 I'd think your kids would be living in Russia,China so they don't endure American children asking them, "Is your Grandfather, Dad so stupid they don't realize Humans have caused Global warming, Drilling oil in ocean should be a NO NO.WHY is your grandfather polluting Earth more"
1320 2018-12-05 21:56:34 Tell that to US oil producers and their employees.
1321 2018-12-05 21:56:27 The world needs less dependence on oil.
1322 2018-12-05 21:56:19 Two days of hysteria and excitement in the oil industry coming up! Can only mean one thing. An opec meeting! Will they or won't they cut? #OOTT
1323 2018-12-05 21:56:15 Ari, Trump, Kushner, UAE, Syria, Saudis, Russia. Oil, Israel, and tribes of old testament history for Israel peace with Palestine.
1324 2018-12-05 21:56:11 Me neither. I had Oilers 5th in Division in my preseason predictions. The Ducks will be the other team. Think it’s between Ducks, Flames, Golden Knights, and Sharks for the playoff race. Oilers are in tough.
1325 2018-12-05 21:55:58 Wait I thought oil was bad
1326 2018-12-05 21:55:50 Oil prices shouldn't go up after that free pass you gave Saudi Arabia. That was the deal, right?
1327 2018-12-05 21:55:47 The whole economy is slowing and housing started long before tariffs. Oil glut is way older than tariffs. I don't know the why or when yet, but I'm sure we're headed down.
1328 2018-12-05 21:55:46 Are u saying he lied!? Gasp. Could it be he makes up? But that Snake Oil is real.
1329 2018-12-05 21:55:43 What I'm guessing is if the price of a barrel of oil reaches down closer to $50 we are in big trouble.
We can't produce our own oil at that price.. more winning?
Or is the communist's winning?
1330 2018-12-05 21:55:42 I need some oil 
1331 2018-12-05 21:55:35 直人さんが何でシモさんって呼ばれてるか聞くの忘れたー
1332 2018-12-05 21:55:29 Took Mom to a dental appt. The lobby had the strongest cinnamon oil scent, and I began hacking immediately and had to leave. Sigh. It’s the most asthmatic time of the year...
1333 2018-12-05 21:55:21 Had to get a oil change and a damn tire
1334 2018-12-05 21:55:20 学校行きたくない夢見た〜〜 あーやだやだ
おぱよーござますʕ•̀ω•́ʔ
1335 2018-12-05 21:55:17 Use Cantu or shea moisture products! Also add one egg, a teaspoon of coconut oil and a teaspoon of olive oil, mix them together and leave as a hair mask for an hour and you’ll notice a difference after one wash.
1336 2018-12-05 21:55:13 oil of rearrange my insides
1337 2018-12-05 21:55:08 You are ridiculous. The Yemen war is about Iran trying to conquer the Middle East. Oil has essentially nothing to do with it.

This conversation is over.
1338 2018-12-05 21:55:07 食パンさん、おはようございます
1339 2018-12-05 21:55:02 Whole baked celeriac, with fresh thyme, parsley, bay, 4 whole slightly crushed garlic cloves,(add a smoked one if you have it) olive oil, vegan white wine, salt and pepper etc. It's so *so* delicious - check Google for many different recipes of it and suitable sides.
1340 2018-12-05 21:54:55 I don’t feel like going to get my oil changed .
1341 2018-12-05 21:54:47 #OPEC cuts better be >1M @Lee_Saks or else #oil goes lower again @chigrl #energy

1344 2018-12-05 21:54:14 Tell that to your buddies in the oil business. Like all businesses, they want mo money!
1345 2018-12-05 21:54:09 My hair never get‘s oily. It‘s so dry, I sometimes even use olive oil.
1346 2018-12-05 21:54:02 Does fish oil have a use besides filling up space on pharmacy shelves?
1347 2018-12-05 21:54:00 Notley was voted in by Albertans and our expectation is that she represent and fight for issues facing us, period. As far as your comments about the gay community, what does that have to do with the price gap in oil?
1348 2018-12-05 21:53:59 Me: My brain smells like my car engine, it's burning oil faster than it should.
Boss: Sound like you'll need a new car next year.
Me: Or a new brain. Whichever gives up first.
1349 2018-12-05 21:53:58 I’ll take a shot;
- appeal federal TMX court decision, lift tanker ban, kill bill C-69, re-engage Energy East, hold foreign oil to the same regulatory standards as CDN oil, suspend AB/Sask carbon tax until pipeline solution, Fed Gov to chip in to help Ab plan to buy railcars.
1350 2018-12-05 21:53:56 The seismic testing tRump just authorized in the Atlantic for oil discovery, loud air blasts under water each equivalent to a stick of dynamite, every ten seconds for as long as months in sequence. I can’t, no I don’t want to think of this purposeful murder of sea life.
1351 2018-12-05 21:53:55 Periplo do one oil change and swear they don’t ever need to do anything ever again
1352 2018-12-05 21:53:54 @DeptofDefense Saudi Arabia has NOTHING in common with you other than oil.  Most of your service men have bibles in their drawers.  The Saudis would lock them up if you weren't around flexing your muscles like...you know, those beach guys.
1353 2018-12-05 21:53:41 I wouldn't worry about Trump striking back. When his advisers tell him that Alberta is cutting back on its oil, he's just going to think some lady in Calgary isn't using as much salad dressing.
1354 2018-12-05 21:53:40 They look as if they need some lotion or oil 
1355 2018-12-05 21:53:29 I mean it’s his fault he enjoys coconut oil that much 
1356 2018-12-05 21:53:13 Just same old story, individual errors all over the pitch. Badly need some oil money spent on this squad.
1357 2018-12-05 21:53:12 品川から静岡に鳩を密輸入中でございます。
1358 2018-12-05 21:52:56 Next person that asks for that is probably getting dunked in the french fry oil
1359 2018-12-05 21:52:52 Heck, let's just burn more coal.  We can run our locomotives on the steam and we can breath in the fresh black air.  Heck, who needs their oil or their alternative energy sources. Not us......
1360 2018-12-05 21:52:34 あいぽんのシャッフル有能すぎて今日は朝からじろ~→サマ→いちろ~って最推し→推しカプの順に聴けてHAPPY
1361 2018-12-05 21:52:28 Fossile fuels lead to bulging pockets full of money. Where did trump dig up this guy. I guess this guy can be bought off or he must have to read Braille. Maybe this guy should either work in a coal mine or take a bath in a barrel of oil and reiterate that he feels very clean now.
1362 2018-12-05 21:52:26 Let's just say Ollie ..it wasn't my greatest day for trolls.
1363 2018-12-05 21:52:26 So thankful for my CBD oil. Haven’t felt any inflammation or pain in my knee for 2 weeks! That’s something to be excited about! 
1364 2018-12-05 21:52:24 At the funeral of the father of the president he called stupid for not seizing Iraqi oil fields (GWB), whose brother he repeatedly attacked personally (Jeb).
1365 2018-12-05 21:52:20 Where can we get those eyelashes? Was the grease from corn oil or canola oil?

1368 2018-12-05 21:52:06 I’m just amazed that in 2018, a barrel of oil is $50 or so, but a gallon of home heating oil is being sold at over $4 a gallon.  How? Someone please help me understand.  $1200 for a 250 gallon tank. Why? Energy costs are too high!
1369 2018-12-05 21:52:02 Really? So,why did you do away with the Obama legislation that banned coal mines from dumping waste into our waterways? Allowed a pipeline through Indian lands that has already leaked oil? Proposed drilling in national parklands?
1370 2018-12-05 21:51:58 Oil change lol.. idk.. 
1371 2018-12-05 21:51:58 lemongrass or lavender oil in the bath is the most relaxing thing ever
1372 2018-12-05 21:51:57 I've seen some Salty fans but you're just a fucking arsehole! The bin dippers are gonna be annoying the oil club all season!
1373 2018-12-05 21:51:55 Jonathan Salk says we are the inflection point of looking back (coal, oil, isolationism, and 'me first') vs. looking ahead (collaboration for a better world, integration of material value with human value.) And he says it's the 'last gasp' for looking back. #gridCONNEXT
1374 2018-12-05 21:51:36 Pretty sure they're past the oil layer and near the molten core of the earth at this point.
1375 2018-12-05 21:51:31 ร้อนในที่ลิ้นลามไปเจ็บคอคือเหี้ยมั่ก
1376 2018-12-05 21:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1377 2018-12-05 21:51:09 You're not correct in blaming KSA for all this mess. Trump begged everyone for 6 months to produce more. You must be a Trump supporter cause you really haven't knocked him for being a liar. He clearly lied and mislead the oil production group all around the world.
1378 2018-12-05 21:51:07 No seriously tho. Spark plugs cost like $3-7 depending on type & oil filters & air filters are about $10-15 ea. You could at least do those & get a bit more life outa the ride until your dollars saved. Just sayin. You'd be surprised how long your shit would last if you did those
1379 2018-12-05 21:50:48 التمسك ب محمد بن سلمان هو بمثابة التمسك بمعول هدم الدولة السعودية .
ألد أعداء السعودية هو الذي يدعو ويشجع على التمسك ب بن سلمان .
1380 2018-12-05 21:50:42 Like i knew it would.  Because my hair loves tea tree oil & this is tea tree & lemon sage conditioner.
1381 2018-12-05 21:50:42 It’s true. Yemen’s oil output is tiny.
1382 2018-12-05 21:50:26 I'm down by strength & #s, I've used all my savings (cushion) + some on stem cells we take monthly drug tests, pay mo co pays + dr visits it's a joke A VERY BAD JOKE! I'm going to try these gummies or oil or whatever the heck it is I hated pot but if it works. What other choice?
1383 2018-12-05 21:50:09 hot oil massage me please.
1384 2018-12-05 21:50:05 if you ever take a college painting class, I had a professor cut a deal with a local art store for oil painting "starter kits" that cut the cost of everything down to like an eighth of what it would have cost if we bought everything separately.
1385 2018-12-05 21:50:00 If the theory is incorrect, that you & @JustinTrudeau do NOT get in the way of pipelines, tell us what's wrong with #EnergyEast - to employ construction workers short-term; AB O&G workers long-term; use AB oil; eliminate Atlantic tanker traffic & Saudi imports; & generate revenue
1386 2018-12-05 21:49:56 I think most people here pissed because he keeps saying we get most of our oil from Saudi and that's not true look at most 41% of our oil from Canada only 11% from saudi so him being that ignorant that he didn't know where Oil comes from he's just ignorant
1387 2018-12-05 21:49:50 picsartとTwitterのスタンプでこの画像つくれるから実質労力0
1388 2018-12-05 21:49:50 And T is soooo worried about oil prices!
1389 2018-12-05 21:49:45 Rich old white men won't be happy until the last drop of oil is sucked out of Mother Earth and the planet is only uninhabitable.  They'll be the only ones that can afford to fly to mars after they make sure they've set themselves up with enough poor people to do the work!
1390 2018-12-05 21:49:39 I wish, but Trump says the prince is good because he still believes in using oil.  Fossil fuels kill the environment and sponsor the Saudis’ in their killing spree.  End support of Saudi prince and switch to renewable resources
1391 2018-12-05 21:49:22 I saturate the area with olive oil then apply the shaving cream. Once I’m done I apply aloe Vera from the plant or the gel from the store to the skin
1392 2018-12-05 21:49:13 GET THE FISH OIL
1393 2018-12-05 21:49:08 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
1394 2018-12-05 21:49:06 Reddit上围观BCer和ABer吵架。关于sand oil最近价格暴跌的问题。BCer说，你们自己选的政府不干活，不在油价牛逼的年代抓紧多元化经济，现在油价不好了，怪BC不让修pipeline，怪联邦把pipeline买下来。咋不找自己毛病。ABer反击，对，怪我们，谁让我们只有开采石油一个办法来给中国洗黑钱。
1395 2018-12-05 21:49:03 How about @RachelNotley shutting off the oil taps to B.C?  Would work a whole lot better.
1396 2018-12-05 21:48:53 Why does Notley not push for energy east ? You would think Eastern Canada would want cheap oil if it was available, with a federal government like we are stuck with maybe that’s the ticket
1397 2018-12-05 21:48:51 @Oil_massge 
1398 2018-12-05 21:48:42 1ヶ月だけでも東邦さんの金魚のフンになりたいなと。
手品家新宿店に出演のマジシャンは本当に恵まれてますよ！
羨ましいw
1399 2018-12-05 21:48:38 Much oil and much footjobs!!!
1400 2018-12-05 21:48:24 Yeah but wht right EU do hv to point fingers at others wn thy killed millions in IRAQ, libya and syria for wht?mere oil contracts. Go home! Thy dnt hv fkin ryt to preach human rights to anyone. Stop telling us their fake virtues. Enjoy ur damn drink in VIANA n stfu.
1401 2018-12-05 21:48:04 Ford designed the Motor engine to run on alcohol. When oil was discovered they stopped using renewable energy for profit that could be made. When they first started to put gas in the engines instead the engines knocked and pinged so they added lead to the gas to quiet them.
1402 2018-12-05 21:48:03 i want to try out oil paint but i’m too pore for all them materials
1403 2018-12-05 21:48:01 Another thought.  Oil's problem under Todd was GAA, but Cam was playing most of time and not well. Oil's problem under Hitch is goals for; GAA are better, but that's with Kosk playing very well, and goals for sucks.  Would Oil have been better with Todd & let him go with Kosk?

1405 2018-12-05 21:47:50 But his fursona is already a bucket of oil, 3 chicken nuggets and Danny Devito's corpse.
1406 2018-12-05 21:47:38 $CEI oil news has to be up... Then we see tomorrow gain or loss... All I know is this company brought land = oil below! = Gold-mine
1407 2018-12-05 21:47:35 i am not supporting any politician that takes money from Corporate interests,  shove your ageism about @SenSanders if you support joe biden etc. when i see "Resistance" people backing  a Candidate i immediately know there no good!  i was for beto until he took money from big oil
1408 2018-12-05 21:47:33 Let’s start squeezing Putin’s oil revenue.   It would be hard to have an arms race with no money.
1409 2018-12-05 21:47:32 Looking for a boo that’s going to oil my hair and keep my dreads looking bomb lol
1410 2018-12-05 21:47:28 Do you?! Pretty sure you have at least 3 permanently wedged up that hairy bum of yours  maybe you should use more coconut oil 
1411 2018-12-05 21:47:28 まあ好みなのでね…良さを分からない方がいいですよ。ロリコンになったらもしかしたら一生かけて悩むことになるかもしれないので…
1412 2018-12-05 21:47:25 My current conditioner's second ingredient is coconut oil so would oiling it overnight be much of an addition? 
1413 2018-12-05 21:47:17 Bed, Bath and Beyond also hate Alberta oil.
1414 2018-12-05 21:47:11 Heat up some vegan refried beans in a skillet. Top in a bowl with frozen tri-color peppers from Trader Joe’s sautéed in olive oil and cumin.
1415 2018-12-05 21:47:04 We have oil. President Obama got us on the road to being self-sufficient.
We WERE developing alternative forms of energy...until YOU were accidentally on purpose...elected.
Stop trying to take us back to the stone age, you effing fool!! 
#OPECShmopec
1416 2018-12-05 21:46:59 あー！いきてえ！！！！！
1417 2018-12-05 21:46:58 I had respect for Brett Wilson the philanthropist. 

But thiss evil/alternate universe twitter version that talks about hanging people and general violence towards anyone that doesn't want to replace their blood with oil is a turdburgarling shitgoblin.
1418 2018-12-05 21:46:58 Mango tofu. Deep fry tofu triangles (firm). Then stir fry with chopped onion, red pepper, semi-ripe mango, and a few slices of ginger. Sauce: ketchup, soy sauce, sugar, rice wine (or sherry), sesame oil, vinegar, and 1 tsp cornstarch. Pour the sauce over and stir for 3 minutes.
1419 2018-12-05 21:46:51 Plus, we can employ those same people who are losing jobs in coal, oil, etc
1420 2018-12-05 21:46:50 Use skincare products/soap that has glycerin. Especially soap that's an oil (coconut/olive/palm) and lye (sodium hydroxide). Glycerin naturally occurs from their chemical reaction. Look for those on the ingredients list and it'll help your skin hold moisture on its own.
1421 2018-12-05 21:46:50 From @highcountrynews October 29, 2018 issue, “2016 findings showed that (the outdoor recreation industry) made up 2 percent of the National GDP-more than mining, oil and gas extraction combined.”
1422 2018-12-05 21:46:47 Your pathetic! Everyone knows that OPEC only accounts for a very small portion of the oil we use in this country. Unlike back in the 70s & 80s. And yet, here you are, propegating a myth to avoid condemning your new best buds, the Saudis, for a callous & brutal murder!
1423 2018-12-05 21:46:43  .........still no
1424 2018-12-05 21:46:40 There is very little oil in Yemen.
1425 2018-12-05 21:46:40 *getting an oil change*

1426 2018-12-05 21:46:33 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1427 2018-12-05 21:46:20 She's talking about flint too, I guess you didn't watch the whole thing.

Claiming that subsidies for green energy and a new economy around it being pie in the sky is also funny: not only does it work well in various countries, the US already subsidizes heavily the oil industry
1428 2018-12-05 21:46:16 all i know is the smell of canola oil burns my nosehairs - and i can still smell it in "vegetable oil blends" -
1429 2018-12-05 21:46:16 There's some occult magic too for sure. When you ask someone at CERN they can't say a Boson is a real particle, even after they claim to find it. There is some high-level compartmentalized theoreticians selling magnetic snake oil. This same thing happened with Einstein.
1430 2018-12-05 21:46:11 RENEWABLE ENERGY DOESNT WORK. iTS NOT ECONOLICAL, FEASIBLE, WHEN ROOF HEATING SYSTEMS ARE 20 YEAR BUYBACK, AND THOUSANDS UPFRONT, IT WILLNEVER HAPPEN @realDonaldTrump KNOWS THAT. COAL AND OIL ARE RELIABLE, CHEAPEST AND EMPLOY MANY
1431 2018-12-05 21:45:31 Did you get this as just a diagnostic? Cuz if not spark plugs aren't hard to replace neither is the oil or air filter. YouTube us your friend.  The transmission is where the real real $$ is. I'd help ya but I'm in AZ. 
1432 2018-12-05 21:45:30 @ShotoItsweng my man! I have been saying this for so long! The template for our economic emancipation has always been right here in the form of Afrikaners! They only got power in 1945 and 30 years later were building nuclear bombs and creating oil from coal (Sasol)!
1433 2018-12-05 21:45:29 Wasn't Obama recently saying " oil production went up every year I was in office. Suddenly America is the oil biggest producer. Uh..that was me people."Obama had the largest oil production increase EVER. That doesn't seem climate friendly to me. #doubletalk #hypocrit
1434 2018-12-05 21:45:22 Yeah... I bet you were supporting them before the oil money eh? I don’t think so.
1435 2018-12-05 21:45:20 Unlike chicken little, the sky actually has been falling for the better part of 13 years in Oil Country. Optimism has  in fact proven to be folly for any Oiler fan. Doesn't mean it can't change, but any past negativity has been 100% warranted and correct.
1436 2018-12-05 21:45:18 Mais bien sur ...les taxes sur le gas oil allaient sauver tout cela! C'est notamment ce que pensait @BertrandPancher au tout début de l'histoire...
1437 2018-12-05 21:45:17 The lady at the dealership knows when I pull in that it’s for an oil change she never try’s to sell me more stuff.      I am here way to much
1438 2018-12-05 21:45:05 Fries, fake "burgers" made out of oil and numerous powders, and Crisco - all "plant-based".

The "plant-based" label on food is just the same as "low-fat" or "sugar-free" in that it generally promotes ultra-processed foods.

Whole foods > packaged products with health claims.
1439 2018-12-05 21:45:00 Good news , the man in charge is hoping for you . There apparently is no plan B to get off fossil fuel and free the USA from being held hostage to oil. Next he will be wishing for you .
1440 2018-12-05 21:44:58 I’m trying to run an art studio inspired by Hello, Kitty, while functioning as a longshoreman. Who’s up for steak 2nite? I’ve got iceberg lettuce, oil & vinegar, & time to klutz around on high-steppers like it’s The Magic Garden. #ImacontenderBatman #StrangerThanStrangerThings
1441 2018-12-05 21:44:49 That he takes donations from individuals that work for oil and gas companies is a bad thing? Should people stop working for oil and gas companies?
1442 2018-12-05 21:44:41 لاتكذبي الصورة  مهو باين ولا واضح الخوف؟؟؟ هههههههههههههههه بس مقهورين من  محمد بن سلمان
1443 2018-12-05 21:44:33 I would love to be rubbed down in some warm baby oil right now. My baby is super tense.
1444 2018-12-05 21:44:32 And you still can’t tell me who is a better manager can you? 

It’s amazing what a team can achieve with oil money.
1445 2018-12-05 21:44:28 You smell like motor oil and left over ham
1446 2018-12-05 21:44:28 Iceland has always used a lot of geothermal energy from their volcanic activity. They have not done away with oil entirely.
1447 2018-12-05 21:44:27 One needs to be a big boy and not be trusting everyone out there. Plus they really went overboard in talking oil down and created this mess. Now it is up to them to fix it.
1448 2018-12-05 21:44:26 "You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together."--Buddah
1449 2018-12-05 21:44:25 Oil........
1450 2018-12-05 21:44:23 Knocked a brand new bottle of CBD oil off my desk and shattered the bloody thing. An expensive mistake to make, and a painful one since I can't replace the oil for a fortnight and its the cornerstone of my pain management strategy. So annoyed at myself right now
1451 2018-12-05 21:44:22 I guess I’m productive today for getting an oil change.
1452 2018-12-05 21:44:20 The US needs to MYOB. The fact there is OIL should tell you what you need to know about why the US is interfering where it does not belong.
1453 2018-12-05 21:44:19 Leave us Canadians alone. It is our oil. Lincoln is rolling in his grave, shaming you.
1454 2018-12-05 21:44:18 I love that the propaganda from keep Canada working is "one additional tanker per day" 

I asked for "one additional nurse" and was neglected. 

Frankly the safe option is zero oil tankers going through the Salish sea over the stuck tectonic plate. 

It's our lives on the line.
1455 2018-12-05 21:44:13 getting my oil changed tomorrow - does anyone have a Baltimore auto shop they love? (my shop is booked)

1457 2018-12-05 21:44:07 Might want to think a little more about your labor force and rural Canadians instead of just Quebec, Ontario, Tech and Manufacturing. Western Canada has most of Canada's national resources, Oil, Agriculture... PM's should work for all Canadians not just the eastern cities.
1458 2018-12-05 21:44:06 Keep producing American oil.  To hell with OPEC.
1459 2018-12-05 21:43:51 yeah  the most popular politician  has no chance mhm but  the man who lost to Ted cruz does okay sure  let me know how Big oil is treating ya in 12 yrs while our planet is burning & humanity goes extinct
1460 2018-12-05 21:43:25 I'm not super familiar with castor oil/red pimento, but I've had really good results with coconut oil and argan oil. (I hate the smell of coconut oil, weirdly, but argan oil smells AMAZING)
1461 2018-12-05 21:43:19 The market makers are clearly naked shorting the market imho, I hope the company release an unexpected RNS that destroys their short position and results in a bull run!

Billions of barrels of recoverable oil in the Weald, eventually the market will have to recognise it!
1462 2018-12-05 21:43:17 Although eucalyptus oil is a great shout I know from experience it can seriously sting errrm fun bits if you put it in the bath

1464 2018-12-05 21:43:15 I need some truffle oil for Xmas
1465 2018-12-05 21:43:12 Let a righteous man smite me - a lovingkindness, that he should correct me, an oil for the head which let not my head refuse! For, yet, even my prayer, shall be in their calamities.
1466 2018-12-05 21:43:08 Are you are talking about the Clean Water Act of 1972, BO expanded without congressional approval?
It was rolled back because it attacked oil & gas developers, farmers, pesticide & fertilizer makers & infringed on property owners’ rights, was bad for the economy.
1467 2018-12-05 21:42:46 That was a big issue at the time, there were protests calling for the U.S. to oust Saddam rather than conceding at the liberation of Kuwait and a lot of people didn't vote to re-elect him because of that. As for war crimes, it was Saddam that lit the Kuwaiti oil wells on fire.
1468 2018-12-05 21:42:43 Och wee man you really miss the point. Oil needn't be used to be valuable. Some would argue it becomes ever more valuable as supply diminishes. As your tweet exemplifies, the same cannot be said for brain capacity nor indeed stature. #indyref2 #ScotRef #DissolveTheUnion

1484 2018-12-05 21:41:11 You could lift sanctions on Iranian oil, 4-5% of world oil supply.
Or even better invest in green power, subsidize electric vehicles 50% burning oil is suicide

1489 2018-12-05 21:41:03 .....and you can get a good machine oil from the hemp seed.
1490 2018-12-05 21:40:54 LMFAO thanks, well its from my theory stuff for my driving lesson and it literally says "your car loses oil. how much drinking water can be ruined by one drop of oil" makes 0 sense
1491 2018-12-05 21:40:46 Surely we can have different opinions about our country without veiled threats?  Mr. Wilson must have a lot of personal $$ riding on Oil/Gas and is putting his personal fortune ahead of environment & country. Also not being pro Oil/Gas is treason?

1493 2018-12-05 21:40:34 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1495 2018-12-05 21:40:23 Canola, soy oil designed to cook at very high heat give off toxic aldehydes especially when French Frying potatoes. US found it was best to "innovate" and create a GMO potato not even "innovator" thinks is safe.Some say modern seed oils cause lung cancer in Chinese cooks....

1499 2018-12-05 21:39:59 What will u now say about those that use onga, crayfish, or my friend that will fry the egg with red oil?
1500 2018-12-05 21:39:51 You must be suffering from a heavy dose of cognitive dissonance if you agree with this while providing a platform for the very snake oil salesmen whom Cohen eviscerates.
1501 2018-12-05 21:39:50 @JudgeTorre I realize Chris is technologically challenged but Trump was tweeting about oil prices right before the funeral started.  Meanwhile, no comment about the 800 point drop in the market today...
1502 2018-12-05 21:39:50 Raises the possibility there’s a Doc Oïl out there.
1503 2018-12-05 21:39:49 1: Thanks for asking, Javier! Auto parts without fuel or traces of fuel are allowed in checked bags. Car engine parts may be placed in checked bags only if they're packed in their original box and free of gasoline and oil.
1504 2018-12-05 21:39:45 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once the 45th president starts whining, a sad wolf whistles the #starspangledbanner
1505 2018-12-05 21:39:38 So true and $50 oil won't begin to cover costs and profit for re-investment not too mention provide motivation for conservation or renewable usage and development
1506 2018-12-05 21:39:35 BRING ON CITY FUCK EM. WE ARE LIVERPOOL. THIS MEANS FUCKING MORE THAN YOUR FUCKING FAKE ASS OIL MONEY CLUB. UP THE FUCKIN REDS
1507 2018-12-05 21:39:17 salmon on whole wheat or brown rice with coconut oil and mix veges that is best you can have you will be all fine . No sugar , no white bread oatmeal with nuts and Olive oil
1508 2018-12-05 21:39:17 How about renewable energy. If money was put into renewable energy we wouldn’t have to worry about OPEC.
Oh that’s right, you just gave billions of dollars in tax cuts to your oil friends!
1509 2018-12-05 21:38:57 I spilled tea tree oil in my carpet like a week ago. Scrubbed it like 5 times && the smell is STILL strong I just used carpet powder stuff but watch the smell come back.
1510 2018-12-05 21:38:34 Connecting oil and gas to cities burning to te ground is ridiculous and some serious mental gymnastics. Have a good day we won’t see eye to eye on this one
1511 2018-12-05 21:38:25 Trump put big tariffs on solar panels slowing the use of this technology. Makes sense when he has stock in oil companies. He also hold stakes in a variety of multinational oil companies like Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil. He also has stock in some pharmaceutical companies
1512 2018-12-05 21:38:18 These mega projects take 10 years of commitment to get the permits.  It’s so painful took over 5 years on a project at my work on the west coast.  And it wasn’t even oil. It’s hard for Canadians to understand this if your r not involved in it.
1513 2018-12-05 21:38:12 So you are hoping? 
Sweet!
If this works out as well as your 'hopes' after Parkland, we are golden!
Hmmmm...maybe if you 'hope' AND 'pray', OPEC will just give us their oil!
1514 2018-12-05 21:38:08 Every one no were does oil goes

1518 2018-12-05 21:37:47 Exercise, high protein diets, sunshine, writing lists, and breathing exercises are things that really help me :) might also recommend CBD oil if you’re interested / if it’s legal in your state. Hope things improve for you bro 
1519 2018-12-05 21:37:36 I know, I used to ALWAYS have one lit! But now I just use coconut oil with essential oils in a wax melter, or an essential oil diffuser!!

1522 2018-12-05 21:37:14 OPEC can charge any price that the market is willing to pay for their oil and you have no say in that. Didn't you learn about supply and demand at Wharton School of Business?
1523 2018-12-05 21:37:06 Tea tree oil
1524 2018-12-05 21:36:54 Which I guess is par for the course considering the previous neolib bae, Trudeau, literally just showed up to the Paris Accords negotiations to gut them for the sake of canadian oil
1525 2018-12-05 21:36:48 do u have to be a certain age to buy olbas oil?

1535 2018-12-05 21:36:05 ye i agree, same with oil idk i was fine with it before, but i started using less oil n tbf i like it more rn
1536 2018-12-05 21:36:03 Oil companies are that worried about the climate change hysteria. They know that almost viable alternatives exist for internal combustion engines in autos and trucks. Leaf and Tesla are fun for short ranged vehicles but if you drive 500 miles per day they suck.

1539 2018-12-05 21:36:01 Protetor solar fator 30 no mínimo e oil free, indicado por dermatologistas, eu mesma utilizo e houve um diferença notável, vale muito a pena além de que possuem também com tonalizante e matte, ótimo para a “correria” do dia a dia!!
1540 2018-12-05 21:36:00 Lmao fr oil changes so overrated and so are tires
1541 2018-12-05 21:35:50 I thought you lowered oil prices already. Did you lie ...or forget that you took credit for something that never really happened
1542 2018-12-05 21:35:47 went to the dealership to pick my mom up while she got her oil changed left considering getting a new car
1543 2018-12-05 21:35:45 Are we able to support ourselves without purchasing any oil from others?

1546 2018-12-05 21:35:22 5. So we have a multi-billion #oil-lobby on one side & the #GreenEnergy-#Con on the other side: Both worth billions in profits, so both incentivised to lie to us! 

I like to see more real #science & dear MSM, "consensus" is not science, it's politics! #ClimateChange
1547 2018-12-05 21:35:19 I don't wish pain on anyone but throughout the video I kept thinking "yeah ok but.. this is the guy who ordered carpet bombings over oil, killing thousands of fathers"
1548 2018-12-05 21:35:09 The truth of Zurbin's statement is manifest.  The Japanese "Great East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" was as much about access to Indonesian oil as it was racism, and German "Leibensraum", the same forces at work.
1549 2018-12-05 21:35:07 Hopefully???

You just screwed the stock market, now you want to screw up the oil market!

Anything to divert from Flynn! I wonder what he told Mueller that led to a pending criminal charge.

Your time is limited

1556 2018-12-05 21:34:38 If he genuinely believed that then I hope to god he stops treating patients and shuts himself away from the public. I also have some snake oil he might like to invest in.... Moron.

1558 2018-12-05 21:34:25 That's a warning for higher gas and oil prices right.  Seen this one before
1559 2018-12-05 21:34:19 Haha the world isn't running out of oil. The OPEC just decides in how much supply there will be, and subsequently who gets to supply how much. It's politically driven.
1560 2018-12-05 21:34:17 Should be using those trailers to transport oil.
1561 2018-12-05 21:34:01 So true. I don’t know a lot of people who have this issue, but I seem to find some help with CBD oil.
1562 2018-12-05 21:33:56 If Mohammed bin Salman is threatened, there will be massive destruction of the US economy. We will unite with Russia and sell oil in Russian currency
1563 2018-12-05 21:33:51 May just have to use Aussie Miracle a bit more frequently. Or good old fashioned hot oil 
1564 2018-12-05 21:33:50 Like I said nobody knew this guy except people from NY. Wish I could have warned more people about this glorified snake oil salesman/ BS artist
1565 2018-12-05 21:33:47 The fatal flaw of capitalism is it's failure to properly account for, & quantify, negative externalities of products & services. 

A prime example of this is oil, in which the bulk of it's costs are hidden & do not reflect in it's price. The actual costs include war & pollution.
1566 2018-12-05 21:33:42 Don't forget about the Louisiana oil field workers.
1567 2018-12-05 21:33:28 ベッドから出れない時はこれ考えてる
1568 2018-12-05 21:33:18 Nothing like @Sands_Glendale trying to get out of an oil change they agreed to pay for. Good thing I kept my paperwork.
1569 2018-12-05 21:33:17 Same. I was in 3rd grade & had 2 older cousins in the army at the time, and I was SO MAD that they were being sent Far Away to Fight for Oil.
1570 2018-12-05 21:33:06 Oil temperature green. Run up checklist, please!
1571 2018-12-05 21:33:05 Winter is super rough on my skin, and it gets so dry  @tartecosmetics Drink of H2O and Maracuja Oil are the only things that keep my skin balanced during the cold months
1572 2018-12-05 21:33:03 Showering with the lights off , candles lit & eucalyptus oil in the diffuser >>>>>
1573 2018-12-05 21:33:00 Lets just start making are own U.S.A made consumer products again even if we pay a little more or eliminate the business tax plus it will put our people back to work. Make prisons factories to help inmates, stop exporting our excess oil and 100% support our farmers! Build WALL.
1574 2018-12-05 21:32:55 Higher oil and coal prices would be mostly a good thing.
1575 2018-12-05 21:32:43 Have I ever mentioned that a few drops of eucalyptus oil in the laundry water (in the soap tray while it’s all swishy) makes everything smell extra fresh but with no fake scent? Plus if your washer is musty it clears that out a bit too.
1576 2018-12-05 21:32:37 My mouth always hurts after i eat potato chips. 
Maybe I'm allergic to potatoes. 
Or maybe it's the 
rancid oil.

1579 2018-12-05 21:32:18 Na now I believe say your head get small oil
1580 2018-12-05 21:32:12 This just reminds me of niggas trying to come for alberta because of the oil
1581 2018-12-05 21:32:04 Getting an oil change is the definition of a “Necessary Evil”. I’ve been in this waiting room for so long I’ve seen the fucking Polar Express two times and we’re not stopping anytime soon
1582 2018-12-05 21:31:56 And who is exploiting that oil in those countries? #hypocrites
1583 2018-12-05 21:31:50 He has done the damage madam
God is with BJP. Some how as elections approach .things start turning in BJP favour. Whether it's crude oil price. Michael extraction or RAGA speech blunders...or siddhu blunders...or kamalnath Muslim remarks blunders..u know it
It's NAMO again
1584 2018-12-05 21:31:43 Once again you demonstrate you almost total lack of understanding of the oil& gas industry and it’s impact on both our and the world economy.
1585 2018-12-05 21:31:42 Jasmine rice with roasted cauliflower (garlic, rosemary, parsley, thyme, olive oil) and potatoes or broccoli depending on how heavy you want it
1586 2018-12-05 21:31:41 errr you do realise how much money oil companies have?
1587 2018-12-05 21:31:30 last time i used baby oil i nutted from fucking a bitch legs when i thought i was in
1588 2018-12-05 21:31:29 The gas lamps were lovely. They used to give a particularly soft light. My old grandmother refused to have electric light in the house and when the gas was finally cut off she had two huge oil lamps. She said electricity was too harsh and bad for the eyes.
1589 2018-12-05 21:31:18 my dumbass got splashed by a tinyyy bit of boiling oil :$
1590 2018-12-05 21:31:12 @texasangeloil Do y’all still have the bacon flavored olive oil? 
1591 2018-12-05 21:31:12 Tell that lie to our chem e alumni oil people out in Texas. Only thing UF has is Shands.
1592 2018-12-05 21:31:08 Cbd products will not get you high, I use Cbd oil to help me with my asd, adhd, anxiety, and odd. It has helped me a lot.

1594 2018-12-05 21:31:03 #OIL #OOTT #WTI
#OPEC is long gone. The new cartel is called #TROPEC which stands for #Trump-#Russia-#OPEC. This is a three-horse carriage or troika. The oil markets' fate is under the control of #TROPEC until #Trump is gone or something unforeseen happens.
1595 2018-12-05 21:30:57 Higher oil will destroy France lol

1598 2018-12-05 21:30:49 Murder- oil.
1599 2018-12-05 21:30:48 Why bother my electric company just increased their rates 30% based upon “long term prices of oil & gas”.  
Spend the $ on renewable energy & stop exporting our fuel to keep prices down
1600 2018-12-05 21:30:46 Understand the federal liberal government doesn't feel Oil is essential in anyway at all...just ask Alberta...
1601 2018-12-05 21:30:46 Whip together 2 cups broccoli with 3 pints honey. Mix in Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve
1602 2018-12-05 21:30:43 They've never operated a marine facility, their plan to build one requiring oil tankers to navigate one of the most dangerous bodies of water in the world. Didn't recognize the difference in development of a mitigation strategy or estimates of the costs associated with cleanup.
1603 2018-12-05 21:30:31 Missing barrels of oil. A pricing mechanism that cannot be understood or explained. And we out here paying through our noses for gas. What is "competitiveness".

1605 2018-12-05 21:30:24 I guess if you let them murder journalists with impunity, they'll keep the oil prices as they are now -- twice what they were when Obama left office.
1606 2018-12-05 21:30:20 Went to get an oil change today and the guy goes “you need your fuel injectors cleaned” (which is something you do like every other year). Here’s the thing: I had it done last month. There. And what’s more, he’s the one that did it!!!!!!
1607 2018-12-05 21:30:19 You and I are like oil and water , plain and pure disaster ~
1608 2018-12-05 21:30:18 Lard is not unhealthy.  Nor is butter.  Keep your Canada Oil (Canola) as that is, in fact, poison.
1609 2018-12-05 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1610 2018-12-05 21:30:04 Uhhhh the United States is the top oil producing country in the world right now. We’re actually exporting our oil to other countries. Gas and oil jobs are the highest paying blue collar jobs out there and petroleum supports a large part of our economy.
1611 2018-12-05 21:30:00 Pear juice. A little milk of magnesium and castor oil mixed with chocolate milk. Just a little. Also baby food prunes. They are also delicious!
1612 2018-12-05 21:29:59 Hi Adam, can u do a chart like this on Oil please? Maybe Gap fill before we go higher?
1613 2018-12-05 21:29:55 my beard is getting itchy and I can’t afford beard oil
1614 2018-12-05 21:29:50 Exactly - fires are not going to stop if the oil and gas industry is halted. They aren’t. And they will always create devastation, as they have for centuries. They were worse hundreds of years ago so I’d say the trend is positive
1615 2018-12-05 21:29:46 Made pasta aglio e olio for dinner and made the dumb decision of wearing a grey t-shirt while doing so... I count 17 oil stains on the shirt now 
1616 2018-12-05 21:29:38 @Oil_Guns_Merica You're super smart.
1617 2018-12-05 21:29:26 Our country depends on oil price and now that it is very low only God will help us.
1618 2018-12-05 21:29:14 This video is irrelevant. Time to focus on battery and solar technology.
Move away from oil as a petrol product.
Leave LNG for heating etc.
Forget hydrogen.
Go electric for propulsion.
1619 2018-12-05 21:28:58 How about spaghetti with YOUR FAVORITE VEGETABLE HERE sauteed with garlic in olive oil? Add red pepper flakes, hold the Parmesan.
1620 2018-12-05 21:28:48 Aaahhhhh......I see !! Your right, worst ever..all those old greedy bastards  that gave us IBM(today' computers) Xerox, Medical Breakthroughs, NASA, Trucking Co's, Oil, Rail, Education, etc.  they worked so today's snowflakes can complain..thanks for your tweet. Peace !
1621 2018-12-05 21:28:44 always remember, that oil that builds up on ur nose is a great lubricant
1622 2018-12-05 21:28:41 F**k You!  I thought the US did mot have to rely on OPEC for oil?
1623 2018-12-05 21:28:36 準備した……ベッドから出れて偉い！
1624 2018-12-05 21:28:27 Rat bassards. They should thank us for being committed anti-colonialists. Instead of kicking them out and taking the oil, we emptied the treasury on them.
1625 2018-12-05 21:28:24 I do. Oil schmoil.
1626 2018-12-05 21:28:22 My son is going to be so excited when we have dinner... I’m making a dipping oil right now 
#takesaftermomma #italianbread #delish #dinnerwillbegoodtoo #datbreadtho
1627 2018-12-05 21:28:16 They will do the bare minimum just to prevent oil from falling further. From here on it will be a very slow upside.
1628 2018-12-05 21:27:58 They are making great strides in technology that detects different types of birds, predicts their flight patterns, & stops the turbine. It isn't perfect but through a combo of wind, solar, nuclear, & hydro we can lessen our dependence on coal & oil
1629 2018-12-05 21:27:54 Just found out @areyoubearface closed down at the beginning of the year. 
No more rusty the hobo oil for my beau 
1630 2018-12-05 21:27:52 It is time to stop burning babies up in war like savages do.
Anyone caught selling weapons to such lunatics ought to be in Hague.
You can`t serve God and money at same time, or oil and environment.

1634 2018-12-05 21:27:26 Geniales!!!, el Skin Therapy Oil tengo años usándolo y recomendandolo me encanta por las noches. El Coconut Oil lo encontré la semana pasada y me gusta su olor, y sensación, lo uso por la mañana. Muuuuy buenos . Además uso sus productos para cabello y cuerpo riquísimos!!!
1635 2018-12-05 21:27:24 Why are we drilling so much oil then instead of putting up more solar and wind renewable energy resources.
1636 2018-12-05 21:27:18 and they cut their global oil demand "growth" estimate, which does not equal a decline. You're perfect for Jesse and Lance, you're just the perfect follower for them.
1637 2018-12-05 21:27:17 You are a traitor. You want us dependent completely on Russian oil. Technology is the future. 
Guess you don’t believe in climate change. trump does. See the precautions he is taking in Ireland & Florida.
1638 2018-12-05 21:27:00 Here are a few sectors to look into for future investments coming into 2019. Assets and commodities that’s all I’m saying. #dontletthemfoolyou

Real Estate* (always)

Your Personal/Business Credit* (learn to leverage) 

Energy* (oil, gas, renewables, battery storage)
1639 2018-12-05 21:26:52 I use a similar saying- friendships/relationships start out like a new car- if you don't oil and service it falls apart....
1640 2018-12-05 21:26:38 Total BS. Technology is to blame if you need to blame something Kenney. Hydrofracturing of horizontal wells in tight, shaley, clastic gas and light oil reservoirs. Bitumen just can’ t compete when that economically.
1641 2018-12-05 21:26:26 generally, from what i hear, it IS greasy at the start. however, your hair generally produces oils to replace that which is stripped away by shampoo. so the more you shampoo the oilier it gets. if you gradually shampoo with lower frequency, your hair produces less oil altogether
1642 2018-12-05 21:26:25 Why?  He's been tweeting for lower oil prices.
1643 2018-12-05 21:26:23 Nah, @Silent0siris is tame. In my first AD&D run I literally perma died in a pit that filled up with oil as my first encounter. That DM was a monster :-)
1644 2018-12-05 21:26:17 Do yall save used cooking oil?
1645 2018-12-05 21:26:14 
1646 2018-12-05 21:26:08 The photo they have with the dude juggling 10 olive oil bottles is amazing
1647 2018-12-05 21:26:05 Those bastards stole my organic coconut oil and apple cider vinegar my skin and hair is not coping.
1648 2018-12-05 21:26:05 Is Brett Wilson worried about Alberta or his own oil & gas investments? He must not be invested in Suncor and Husky, whom he criticized for not being concerned enough about the oil crisis.
1649 2018-12-05 21:26:05 thered be a thick layer of oil and dead skin cells floating on the surface
1650 2018-12-05 21:25:57 Sounds like you are the one bending over, ignoring all the issues of fossil fuels like oil spills, climate change. Only reason they are not being replaced is because of oil lobby. Do you have all the climate change affects,  complications and damage they cause figured out?
1651 2018-12-05 21:25:40 She said "because of olive oil" 
1652 2018-12-05 21:25:36 And if you say “they’re worse in the last 20 years” and I say, no the worse fires are from the 1800s, why doesn’t that matter? This “fire conditions created by oil going to world markets” argument is just not viable or sensical
1653 2018-12-05 21:25:27 2) What's the worst that could happen to the world's oil supply?
2) In the short run catastrophic losses of oil supply are unlikely  Graceful declines like we've seen in Venezuela, sure - but the immediate loss of entire countries?  We have the firepower to prevent that. mthebold
1654 2018-12-05 21:25:25 A duck oil cleanse perhaps?
1655 2018-12-05 21:25:16 She sponsored a terrible mining bill in MN that endangers Lake Superior for a non US polluter, Polymet, the ones who gave us the BP oil spill. Snuck it in a defense bill. She is 50% GOP.
1656 2018-12-05 21:25:14 It’s such an inconvenience!
I also used a comb too after I put the oil in her hair and I combed out as much as I could.
1657 2018-12-05 21:25:08 Are you running an Arga as well? That kind of burn is only done by my friends with Oil argas and heating. You may find some electric oil filled heaters useful.
1658 2018-12-05 21:24:46 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
1659 2018-12-05 21:24:45 Álvaro Salvador, @Ideele: "Santa Clara de #Uchunya presented a formal complaint against the palm oil company to the @RSPOtweets, however the authorities have not heeded any of their recommendations & the situation remains unchanged." #IACHRHearings #StandWithUchunya
1660 2018-12-05 21:24:40 Try and mix  Spirit, olive oil, glycerin and your normal body cream!! A month is good enough
1661 2018-12-05 21:24:38 the sun gives u energy on a daily, foc, btw. But(t) hey, cash in the $$$ they spend in ur hotels with free money they make on oil for a greenback, u guys are printing for free. Lmao
1662 2018-12-05 21:24:31 If I am going around talking to oil executives to raise max contributions for a candidate, what do people suppose I am going to be sitting in a board room talking about? Why are those executives all going to write me a check?...
1663 2018-12-05 21:24:30 Norwegians DO care about keeping their country clean. They can afford to due in part to North Sea oil finds in 1960s. #Norway's a MAJOR #petroleum exporter (8th largest for crude & 3rd largest for #naturalgas in 2011). Crude/NG accounted for 40% of Norway's export value in 2015!
1664 2018-12-05 21:24:18 Frank = owned
1665 2018-12-05 21:24:16 1) How much oil can the world produce at a given price? (Higher prices More oil is economic)

1) In the long run, the world could produce all the oil it wanted at $100/bbl  Between demand destruction, fracking, lower break evens for conventional/deep water oil - mthebold oilprice
1666 2018-12-05 21:24:15 Ahahahhahahahaa, 1750 horses 

They piss horses like they piss oil
1667 2018-12-05 21:24:13 Gold, silver, uranium, natural gas, Canadian oil. Some I am missing. It's a hard asset list.
1668 2018-12-05 21:24:09 食パンさん、おはようございます！
1669 2018-12-05 21:23:58 GET THE OIL BACK IN U OR  GET A  TEACHER WITH OIL OF GOD A BURNING REAL HOT AS RED HOT IN EM-GET WITH GOD GET INSIDE THE FIRE OF GOD-OUTSIDE R THE LUKEWARM COLD OF CHURCH BODY-LIGHTS OUT I WARN TO ALL OF U-HEAR ME BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT WILL BE SO-
1670 2018-12-05 21:23:55 “Creates conditions that makes them worse” is a straw man argument and nonsensical. What started them? Why doesn’t that matter? Getting from ‘Oil going to world markets’ to that ‘creating horrible forest fires’ is some crazy mental gymnastics.
1671 2018-12-05 21:23:50 OIL , GAS AND MINING INTERESTS are all Sec of Interior Zinke cares about!IS there one cabinet member that cares about WHAT IS BEST FOR USA? With a mission to PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES Zinke is taking care of PPL THAT WILL THEN TAKE CARE OF HIMOnly the best? NOT
1672 2018-12-05 21:23:49 ScotLand told you and Sturgeon they ignore so Scotland do what Scots do Stan up for independent Nation soon currency and keep your oil no socialist share the wealth Bull./ Scotland 1st is a great idea.
@caos_sinclair
1673 2018-12-05 21:23:40 CBD alone didn't work for me either. Are you able to get access to a combo oil or capsules with CBD & THC? They call it 1:1 hybrid. I have to have THC in it!
1674 2018-12-05 21:23:39 Please drink a quart of oil and do us all a favor.
1675 2018-12-05 21:23:36 You can get fish oil to put on their food from any pet store!!
1676 2018-12-05 21:23:32 Snake oil salesman!
1677 2018-12-05 21:23:28 I've been taming mine with hair oil, which I got from Haus of Gloi (vegan bath scrub and perfume and stuff company). Last year they did a Pain au Chocolat scent so now I smell like a chocolate croissant some days. I find it very comforting.
1678 2018-12-05 21:23:25 Yes oooo
1679 2018-12-05 21:23:24 IDK, my RV has it's own battery bank, totally off the grid.  Neighborhoods could do that too. We could even share these little mini-grids in emergencies. The human race is more than smart enough to solve this problem.  Just need the fat cat oil companies to get out of our way.
1680 2018-12-05 21:23:23 Yeah but all that being said!!! Ur still a Republican , and that hasn't changed.
When you decide to denounce the Republican party you will have a leg to stand on again .. The Republican party has lost a lot of credibility with the emergence of that snake oil salesmen.
1681 2018-12-05 21:23:13 if the wise men were so wise they woulda brought jesus sandalwood oil instead of gold
1682 2018-12-05 21:23:12 Do you sound like Olive Oil the whole time when you’re doing that too?
1683 2018-12-05 21:23:10 @julthulhu 

I have considered upgrading my Twitter persona's toolkit to include the following:
- A cadre of coffee-addicted impettes
- Refinement of the Oil Slider ability from Mega Man Powered Up
- An 8-ball themed bowler hat 
- Something reflective of "obligate carnivore"
1684 2018-12-05 21:23:08 Bet it needs a ton of work, oil activated injectors and such really make those ornery
1685 2018-12-05 21:23:06 Do you realize Lush is anti-Canadian oil?  Against us getting our natural resources to market.  The money from which supports people from across our country.  Perhaps another business not anti/Canadian would be a better choice. #canadianoil
1686 2018-12-05 21:22:54 Been off twitter a week now an fwd back fi see oil gone missing, 1 big batty jcan gyal win some dance competition an cardi b an offset mussi break up.... Big up d big batty gyal
1687 2018-12-05 21:22:53 Myrrh contains gum, resin, volatile oil, & phytochemicals w/ stimulant, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, estrogen, expectorant, antispasmodic, & carminative properties. 
Gold is actually a micronutrient we need (not to mention it’s obvious other uses) So yes, gifts fit for a king
1688 2018-12-05 21:22:46 A number of the oil companies had travel guide series - they were in the gasoline business so it made sense to encourage car travel. Both Mobil and Shell had big series.
1689 2018-12-05 21:22:42 well maybe next time instead of loosing your mind watching the Oil give it a try
1690 2018-12-05 21:22:40 Dude, the world should be moving away from oil.
1691 2018-12-05 21:22:40 Bones don't turn to oil. Wake up y'all
1692 2018-12-05 21:22:27 finn can use a jumpsuit that looks like something someone would use to work at an oil company and he will look cute anyways
1693 2018-12-05 21:22:27 I took cbd oil, like 45mins ago
1694 2018-12-05 21:22:26 Oil Filter numbers! I was doing inventory at my repair shop 
1695 2018-12-05 21:22:07 Ok, agreed!  Let’s levy a fine of two barrels of oil on them and move on with business. Khashoggi was another media nerd who ratted on the royals frequently. Some of them here at home deserve the same medicine, but that’s illegal!
1696 2018-12-05 21:22:02 In Jaén you can do a 4 year degree studying olive oil...
1697 2018-12-05 21:22:01 Haha no that’s just a fake thing. Castor oil is supposed to help hair growth not sure if it’d work for beard gaps lol
1698 2018-12-05 21:21:41 What would it take to get anti-pipeline NGOs to get on board to help sell our oil so we can build a more efficient energy infrastructure?...carbon pricing maybe? @PremierScottMoe
1699 2018-12-05 21:21:40 I used baby oil when my oldest daughter had it!
1700 2018-12-05 21:21:35 HO HO HO!!!! Santa stopped in to get some beard oil and to ask who’s been naughty or nice!  
1701 2018-12-05 21:21:29 What is worse, their revenues declined because of lower oil prices but they busted their "donations" by 144%. I've worked with companies where cost containment is priority if revenues contract. They have to use loans for day to day operations. 
1702 2018-12-05 21:21:18 Good car loads mot heated seats lowered 180bhp 4 wheel drive have a major oil leak from sump think it's just crack though so easy fix need gone 650 no offers cheap fetching 1400 on eBay spare or repares
1703 2018-12-05 21:20:57 No worries trumpy boy... we are paying the oil with human blood.
1704 2018-12-05 21:20:53 OK, here is some elementary economy.  In the absence of speculative hoarding and manipulation, the price of a commodity like wheat, copper, gold, or oil is the point where two graphs cross: >>
1705 2018-12-05 21:20:46 Purchase any new Honda @LovingHonda before 12-25-18 to receive complimentary oil changes and tire rotations for: TWO YEARS! 
Don’t drive hours and then sit for hours more trying to find the best deal. 
The BEST TIME to BUY ALL YEAR is here.  Don’t miss out…
1706 2018-12-05 21:20:45 NOTHING DELICIOUS OIL POOL AWAY ALIVE PAYING ATTENTION TO SLEEP SINGING END BOTHER MONSTER BODY SHOOK HANDS COPS STAY MAYBE
1707 2018-12-05 21:20:45 that’s no reason for you to our oil on the fire. Wreckless and dangerous attitude you have there. You’re a rodef
1708 2018-12-05 21:20:42 Good piece from @ks24027 @ColumbiaUEnergy on ways financial positioning amplified recent energy price moves both oil and gas. Given continued fundamental uncertainty and mixed data signals on energy and macro sides, positioning and overshooting risks critical to watch
1709 2018-12-05 21:20:41 It is not "Oil Producers Executing Critics" either.
1710 2018-12-05 21:20:32 Hey there. You know Trump doesn't actually control gas prices right? The cost of crude oil accounts for 65% of gas prices. The cost of crude oil is determined by global supply and demand. If the worldwide demand for crude oil is high, and supply low, oil prices will be high.
1711 2018-12-05 21:20:31 Love cannot endure indifference It needs to be wanted Like a lamp it needs to be fed out of the oil of anothers heart or its flame burns low
1712 2018-12-05 21:20:31 coconut oil is a life saver honestly
1713 2018-12-05 21:20:22 lit some candles, put on my fav playlist, took a hot oil bath, exfoliated, shaved, lotioned, now im making my favorite meal. self care from here on out bitch gtfoh
1714 2018-12-05 21:19:49 Get some vitamin e pulls, open them with a clean clothes pin and massage the oil in twice a day
1715 2018-12-05 21:19:43 YASSSS! Her Coconut Oil EP has been on repeat for wEeEeKs! 
1716 2018-12-05 21:19:39 We just had aloo gobi and red lentils with fried onions. Gf and vegan if you use coconut oil instead of butter.
1717 2018-12-05 21:19:38 #ماالذي_يقتل_العلاقه_الزوجيه العلاقه الزوجيه نفسها.
1718 2018-12-05 21:19:37 In a lot of products it is animal fats/products like lard or butter that they have substituted the palm oil with, which is why a lot of own brand products that used to be vegan aren't anymore x
1719 2018-12-05 21:19:35 Oil of Every Pearl's Un-insides by Miss SOPHIE
1720 2018-12-05 21:19:24 Well I guess the more oil is being used the higher the oil prices will go. I guess nature must produce that oil that we use and it can‘t produce faster than we use.
1721 2018-12-05 21:19:11 oh my goodness. For the 4th time. I never said that carbon/oil creates the fires. I said it creates conditions that make those fires worse, and lengthens the fire season.
1722 2018-12-05 21:19:06 Ooooh yes. Or harissa oil. Add to anything you’re cooking with olive oil. Niiiice heeeeeat.
1723 2018-12-05 21:19:00 And, the world will never see a #GreenNewDeal as to keep the oil flowing! The Big Don thinks it will be a WIN-WIN for #BigOil AND #Christians! Big Oil will profit until the end of the world, and Christians will get their #Armageddon at the end of world! #MAMA #QAnon #MAGA
1724 2018-12-05 21:18:59 I really need to get an oil change before I go home Friday. It’s been back to back trips
1725 2018-12-05 21:18:57 Do you know what else oil is used for?
1726 2018-12-05 21:18:56 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
1727 2018-12-05 21:18:55 My truck has bad glow plugs though, so it gets plugged into a block heater. At that point it's cheating since the oil and coolant is warm
1728 2018-12-05 21:18:54 Stupid comment. I’m in the oil business. We make more money selling our oil and importing the right quality oil.
1729 2018-12-05 21:18:54 I know Beto is cool and all but dude still took half a mil of oil and gas money. Rad skate tricks tho
1730 2018-12-05 21:18:26 Utter bullshit. The US is in Syria illegally for an oil pipeline for Israel. That's a fact.
1731 2018-12-05 21:18:18 The US imports only about 33% of its oil from OPEC.  40% of our oil needs are met at home. We are about to beat Saudi Arabia to be the world’s biggest exporter of oil. 
We can definitely afford clean energy, alternative autos and NO drilling for oil in pristine Alaska and Pacific
1732 2018-12-05 21:18:11 Less than a year nau. But I know you are really enjoying fatherhood. And you go out for your friends. Then oil boss, though you always want to code it 
1733 2018-12-05 21:18:04 Coconut oil is Sister Girl lotion & grease
1734 2018-12-05 21:18:02 U blame me for Trump tweeting about oil prices?
1735 2018-12-05 21:17:49 Being a beautiful celebrity has helped her career in snake oil sales. I wonder if she really believes in all that crap. She’s either stupid or dishonest.
1736 2018-12-05 21:17:49 Before what? People stop commiting arson? I agree, take horrible. But the worst fires are not now, they are from the 1800s, carbon and oil being sold to world markets doesn’t create fires -that’s not correct.
1737 2018-12-05 21:17:26 When u see oil
1738 2018-12-05 21:17:26 I also work on nuclear sites, fracking sites and gas and oil exploration.

And these days it's mostly fossils.

Nice try at dismissing my opinion though. Someone with no experience of these things is clearly a fairer voice. Listen to Jörg instead.
1739 2018-12-05 21:17:18 Itchy. I figured oil would make it easier to... um
1740 2018-12-05 21:17:18 3. helps I was critical of Bill Mckibben's approach to Obama as well. The constant giving the democrats a pass, and blaming the republicans is not going to change anything, and will only be detrimental. And environmental groups who take money from oil & gas is not a group I would
1741 2018-12-05 21:17:13 Grill some veggies with some olive oil, salt/pepper...warm some corn tortillas, add some salsa and call it a day. Grilled veggie tacos.
1742 2018-12-05 21:17:10 Water or fluid?  Non-conductive fluorocarbons or oil have been used before. Cray-2 comes to mind
1743 2018-12-05 21:17:04 There are other viable energy sources - the point is to get off burning fossil fuels, and currently building more oil capacity leads to more burning - bad for #climatechange.
1744 2018-12-05 21:17:00 Whew Im running on fumes and still hungry! Appts since 7:30a! Not to mention da unexpected $1k expense of getting new tires + an oil & brake fluid change. Gotta pickup my furry baby @ 5. Then I'll be able to love on him, eat & sleep...in that order! Thank God I took the nite off!
1745 2018-12-05 21:16:54 My boys love my #mistresschampgne it really is my favourite thing to do. I love making you drink it in public & pouring it on your food like olive oil. It’s the Italian in me 
1746 2018-12-05 21:16:48 why are soft pastels prioritized more than oil pastels like in my opinion oil pastels are way better and they’re only like two brands of them here
1747 2018-12-05 21:16:45 US Closing prices: #DOW -3.10% #NASDAQ -0.00% #Ftse100 -1.44% #GBPUSD 1.2729 #EURGBP 0.8909 #EURUSD 1.1343 #Gold 0.02% #Oil 0.26%
1748 2018-12-05 21:16:45 An alternate way to state is, oil is the backbone of Canadian economy and needs a serious look before it starts raining.
1749 2018-12-05 21:16:44 No. I have 1st hand family knowledge on that fiasco. My brother and his young family at the time were living there. He was exec in oil biz.
1750 2018-12-05 21:16:40 Big oil can crow “green green green” in more ways than one. Multitasking!
1751 2018-12-05 21:16:31 まだベッドにいる
1752 2018-12-05 21:16:31 The world needs to see lower oil use according to you own reports on global warming.  The world does not want to see, or need, higher sea levels!
1753 2018-12-05 21:16:29 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
1754 2018-12-05 21:16:28 Lol nothing fancy dw. Sugar, coconut oil, lemon juice 
1755 2018-12-05 21:16:25 I wasn't aware we eat oil.
1756 2018-12-05 21:16:24 Lawyers for big oil. LAWYERS. You know, the people who fight in court against climate change?

At what age did you stop giving a shit about the planet & start defending lawyers for the petro industry?
1757 2018-12-05 21:16:24 Your story is better than mine. I was in a Lucas oil stadium bathroom and the place erupted.
1758 2018-12-05 21:16:24 1. The only personal comment I made before you said I was the worst, was that you have never criticized Obama for his environmental policies, such as opening the Arctic to drilling, and by his own recent admission is responsible for an increase in gas & oil production in the US.
1759 2018-12-05 21:16:22 Let's keep a live stream on them 24-7. Everyone gets lonely and those gals ain't half bad.
1760 2018-12-05 21:16:16 as expensive as Sheetz food has become it would cost $187.45 to build this and as the cost goes up the size gets smaller so this is probably a mini stack madeto look larger by the reflection of the puddle of mototr oil.
1761 2018-12-05 21:16:14 あと15分後に家から出…出れ……………る気がしない
1762 2018-12-05 21:16:11 I'm looking at Frankie Muniz right now, he's running an oil and vinegar shop in Scottsdale
1763 2018-12-05 21:16:08 We haven't forgotten that Kuwait was side drilling into Iraq's oil fields with technology sold by the US and wouldn't stop or compensate Iraq. Bush needs to answer things to our maker and not us. He was a prez, whether you like it or not.

1766 2018-12-05 21:15:58 Why wouldn’t they? You’ve already let the murdering MBS off the hook. So because today wasn’t all about you...you would like to gin up a crisis so you can appear to solve it and play the hero??? We get most of our imported oil from Canada and Mexico anyway.
1767 2018-12-05 21:15:56 Zainab don't stress your self too much on RESEARCH; the only way for Nigeria oil and gas industry to move forward is " the unbundling of NNPC and allow Private sectors to come and build Refineries.... Thank God with @DangoteGroup Refinery.

1769 2018-12-05 21:15:52 YOU are tge worst polluter! Coal sludge in rivers, drilling for gas and oil in pristine park lands
1770 2018-12-05 21:15:46 Well it is their oil. Their decision. Like your decision to implement tariffs. What's good for the goose and all...

1772 2018-12-05 21:15:44 Still he mentioned Norway because they have pretty cold climate and the Teslas would not be sold there if they did not work in winter time. But sure Norway have amazing forward thinking strategy (can afford it because of oil)
1773 2018-12-05 21:15:39 Love this thread!! My quickest go-to is pasta & pepper. Cook pasta, toss it with oil, and sprinkle with pepper. If I'm feeling fancy, I'll slice some olives or some chives for a garnish. If I have some capers, I'll throw some of those on top, too. Or whatever you have on hand. 
1774 2018-12-05 21:15:31 Moral being

1775 2018-12-05 21:15:22 for healthier life , try to avoid eating fried meals and minimize using oil in your daily life .
1776 2018-12-05 21:15:11 Once looked under the rig, easy to separate and get the spilt oil to market. Drill drill drill. And thx for ANWR.

1784 2018-12-05 21:14:34 Beto isn't right for the job you guys. Too much of an oil sellout to name just one reason why we should look elsewhere for 2020. Hmmmm, how about @SenSanders
1785 2018-12-05 21:14:32 Shoutout to my aunt for going to get my oil change and getting my tag for me !! YYAYYYYY!! 
1786 2018-12-05 21:14:22 I just hope you don't do ruby...

But to be honest, I myself had my fair share of experiences with big corporate oil, and even worse finance, company as well.... XD
1787 2018-12-05 21:14:21 I've been watching a lot of healthy curly hair stuff on youtube so I'm like ON MY JOURNEY to bring my hair back to former glory. I saw some saying castor oil + red pimento oil is REALLY good for hair growth?
1788 2018-12-05 21:14:09 Changing my tires and doing my own oil change today .... who am I ? 
1789 2018-12-05 21:14:01 We've put billions of tax dollars in renewable energy! Dont ack like we're doing nothing! Democrats have blocked every attempt for energy independence. Reality is without oil we'd starve to death.  Wise up!
1790 2018-12-05 21:13:52 He would because he simply can’t conceive of not being able to do whatever the hell he wants. He actually believes he is virtuous rather than slipping thru snares by his exuded snake oil. He buys *everything* he’s selling.

1794 2018-12-05 21:13:31 @SenBillCassidy I just created a twitter to ask you if you were aware of the Taylor Oil Spill happening right now?  This video shows you behind Mr. Trump announcing he'd like to expand off shore drilling.  How can you consider it when there's so much clean up to be done?

1798 2018-12-05 21:13:01 The most exciting thing I've done is make my own pita crisps. Cut pita breads into wedges, add a little olive oil, then toast. Tastes good with hummus. Lost a bunch to Spawn 1 also. (Tasted much nicer than the packet stuff tbh)
1799 2018-12-05 21:12:55 I thought BC didn't want Alberta oil?

1801 2018-12-05 21:12:36 Bloviators plan and leaders build. Alberta is hurting and the pain is worse knowing a conservative PM was so incompetent he could not build a single pipeline to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil. That level of failure from one of Alberta's own is hard to fathom

1821 2018-12-05 21:10:47 And they don't even have a real local industry, only Olive oil & wine production & phosphate mining
1822 2018-12-05 21:10:47 That's a first for me. I've never seen a drink that calls for olive oil.
1823 2018-12-05 21:10:47 I forgot what working ten hour shifts were like. I need some oil and my bed. 
1824 2018-12-05 21:10:40 Lmao I remember that and no they won’t mention it
1825 2018-12-05 21:10:37 You can ALL thank Trump for convincing the Saudis to keep oil flowing. He is the main reason for lower gas prices. #Period
1826 2018-12-05 21:10:36 Dont even hate city , jus other clubs have absolutely no chance of competig with the oil money .
1827 2018-12-05 21:10:31 I for one will be so glad when we ALL move to renewable energy...solar & wind are clean & free! No more dirty cancer causing oil, fracking or coal!

1832 2018-12-05 21:10:14 You're good lol I bought one by Linduray Skincare, it was like $25. I use Tarte's maracuja oil which is packed with vitamin C but any vitamin C serum would work honestly to help brighten. I only derma roll my cheeks and chin but i don't believe any breakouts were from that.

1837 2018-12-05 21:09:37 We subsidize oil companies by taking native lands for private gain, too. We subsidize farmers not to grow things but we need them in a bigger picture. I agree there should be measurable criteria to evaluate a subject that has national impact.
1838 2018-12-05 21:09:37 Blotting the oil off my face with oil sheets in the middle of the library is reaching my final form
1839 2018-12-05 21:09:36 Thank you Mr. Prez. Free Market environmental solutions with massive marketing-goodwill potential for compliance. Low cost. Economically driven solutions. How about skirting on oil rigs that drop down outer support columns if vertical underwater pipe bursts?  Oil won’t spread.
1840 2018-12-05 21:09:29 What are all wars for? To take the other guys stuff. West didn't want to appear the bad guy, so they invented terrorist~(boogeyman) to war against with real goal disrupt, destroy 7 countries for their oil, gas & minerals.
1841 2018-12-05 21:09:26 #OPEC: what will happen in Vienna? Judging by large drops on Saudi official #oil selling prices to Asia, not much (of substance).

Hmm Saudi Sheiks, Venezuela, Africa, or Trumps USA. Anything but Canadian Pipeline Oil which would give tens of billions for all Canadians. Stupidity .

1856 2018-12-05 21:08:24  yea i know much but i read an article how he negotiated for oil prices to go down from other country’s and keep the demand the same. It’s gon always be fuck him lol

1859 2018-12-05 21:08:09 Hah! Minty times! You can actually use the same / slightly adjusted recipe and toss it with a little oil in a hot wok and boiled & sliced / diced potatoes for a yummy potatoes side.
1860 2018-12-05 21:08:02 What if gravity isn't the pulling effect caused by known matter, and instead is a pushing effect caused by unknown matter or energy? Like oil and vinegar. I vape. #gravity
1861 2018-12-05 21:08:01 Damn. I'm really out here having to block people who are trying to humanize the fucking Bush family. These people would kill you and everyone you love for $100 in oil. They are war criminals. Fuck their feelings. They all deserve death and fuck you too thinking they don't.
1862 2018-12-05 21:07:58 1) If TSSA is failing to inspect 111,300 oil and gas pipelines, putting our water and health at risk, why is the Premier giving up our veto power over new pipelines entering Ontario?

#onpoli #Bill57 (2/4)
1863 2018-12-05 21:07:57 China will buy & use all the oil it can - after world’s oil is gone, China will be the only producer of oil; selling at exhorbitant prices - since only they have any oil.
1864 2018-12-05 21:07:47 One would need mileage and oil change frequency/history to start with, then info on soundness of doors as they shut, review of underbody for signs of leaks or paint overspray ( wreck), reports of unusual odors, condition of paint, windshield booboos or cracks, alignment of doors,
1865 2018-12-05 21:07:46 Easily prevailed upon to believe something. Oil patriots seem susceptible to believing that only governments are in the way of their just dessert, a perpetual oil boom.
1866 2018-12-05 21:07:35 NO --- we want more solar and wind plants. I would love to put up a solar panel here in NH but I can't afford it. CA is going to start mandating solar panels on new homes for a % of their power. But all this president cares for is the price of oil. Or more "clean coal" plants.
1867 2018-12-05 21:07:32 I’m a huge supporter, agree with everything you have done but calling for lower oil prices I have to disagree. When oil prices get to $65-$70 the oilfield and its many service companies do very well along with local economy. It effects more than u know. Come visit. West Tx.

1872 2018-12-05 21:07:11 @BarackObama You shameless smug bastard seeking credit for an almost doubling of oil production,while talking about climate change accords?You're
talking out of both sides of your mouth&it should be a crime
Oil industry funded climate change denial for decades,
YOU HAVE ZERO CRED
1873 2018-12-05 21:07:10 Yes they will. Because we are going to continue fighting the oil companies that pay you to troll social media. The same ones that have been deliberately blocking technology that will save the planet simply so they can make a buck.
1874 2018-12-05 21:07:08 Ya they dont want to pay for carbon tax. And UN 40+ dollars eventual tax.  Without oil etc no modernization. They want to enforce rules by the axe
1875 2018-12-05 21:07:05 That ain’t got nothing to do with him so fuck him still . That got to do with it being more than enough or not enough oil in the rigs (my mom told me) &’ when it go down, the oil business doing bad, when it go up they good.
1876 2018-12-05 21:07:04 For an evil man that took brought us into Desert Storm and tried to keep us there for oil. Oh yeah and raised a ton of taxes. Yeah, I remember, and I was only 17
1877 2018-12-05 21:06:57 I think EVERY Oil producer in the US disagrees with that statement.
1878 2018-12-05 21:06:53 i mix my oil and my perfumes and it’s been a match made in fragrance heaven ever since

1880 2018-12-05 21:06:45 so what excuses do u tell yourself as to why Trump didnt arrest her on day one? How long will it take for her not to be arrested before you realize the whole thing was made up by oil and chemical execs so they could continue to destroy the planet for $

1883 2018-12-05 21:06:41 For those of us off grid the summer winter contrast is pretty dramatic... load the oil price volatility over the last 16 years on top and one gets some extraordinary results... ps an oil price low in January is good news ...
1884 2018-12-05 21:06:33 We may not need their oil anymore... 
1885 2018-12-05 21:06:33 Yup  I was sort of riffing on that theme. I just wasn't expecting it also to be a US product. Just didn't scan. Like "Wakefield" as the brand name for some cooking oil or something. I thought it was called that cos it was marketed at us dumb Brits but no lol. Just an odd brand
1886 2018-12-05 21:06:31 Gabon is a leading oil producer but Bongo is chilling in Morocco because his father Omar Bongo looted the oil revenues and Ali Bongo has also done the same. No sensible hospitals built. The proletariat needs to overthrow these criminals.
1887 2018-12-05 21:06:29 If you like Indian food, a lot of indian dishes are or can easily be made vegan with the substitution of coconut milk and oil for animal milk and butter

1889 2018-12-05 21:06:16 We all know the reason we invaded Iraq was for oil
1890 2018-12-05 21:06:13 But aren't higher oil prices making OPEC rich again?  Two can play the game, ya know.
1891 2018-12-05 21:06:00 IMO our farmers should grow hemp now. It can make many products including a biodegradable plastic and oil. There is more money in the product and I am sure Trump knows this. Trump isn't a perfect man but he is perfect now for the USA
1892 2018-12-05 21:05:48 Republican voters bought that snake oil for 35+ years. But I the truth is finally dawning on them.

1894 2018-12-05 21:05:38 Solar Development was blocked by oil companies for many decades. It has been advancing extremely steadily in recent years. Once the technology catches up it will surpass Fossil fuels in every conceivable way.

Oil and coal are the busted down rust-bucket jalopies of power sources
1895 2018-12-05 21:05:32 Question. I really hope these chocolates are palm oil free. #theApprentice
1896 2018-12-05 21:05:25 Yes OPEC is nothing more then an illusionist when it comes to oil cuts/quotas. Would love to see them get their a$$ kicked and become price takers like the rest of us.
1897 2018-12-05 21:05:23 Yes of course *takes the chips from you before beginning to heat the oil in the fryer*
1898 2018-12-05 21:05:23 We want no oil
1899 2018-12-05 21:05:20 You've done zero... it's because oil went down...  when it goes back up will you take credit for that too... or pass the buck?.. We all know what you'll do Dougie da Donut Dictator.

1905 2018-12-05 21:04:29 What do you think pays for infrastructure you moron! Why do you think Canada is going down the tubes finicalLy as the deficit balloons beyond what we’ve ever seen? ....because we have no exports of our Canadian dirty oil...but it’s ok to buy it from the Saudi’s?
1906 2018-12-05 21:04:27 He'll accomplish that when thousands leave the state thanks to draining savings with back paid PFDs, no new revenues, and declining oil prices. 

But hey, $6,700 bucks is $6,700 bucks right?
1907 2018-12-05 21:04:22 "OPEC’s de facto leader and largest producer Saudi Arabia saw its oil production soar by 350,000 bpd from October to 11.02 million bpd in November—an all-time high, and 1 million bpd higher than the level at which Riyadh was producing in May this year"
 Well?
1908 2018-12-05 21:04:18 yeah when oil and gas didn't own it
1909 2018-12-05 21:04:16 Oh so we’ll be able to get our oil to port?

Welfare is not a job.

1913 2018-12-05 21:03:56 You think I’d know better than to take my truck to @Ford for maintenance,oil change and 2 tire balance. $75
1914 2018-12-05 21:03:44 you can't produce oil pool once again, oil is an ending resource - price can't become lower. If you get it different way - it's not means that, there will be even more then you can get out of there. this all is destroying the planet.
1915 2018-12-05 21:03:43 or just that they vaguely recognise your face and feel they need to say something to oil the wheels of the next encounter. Much worse though: I saw your piece (ie and cldn't be arsed to read it/hated it)
1916 2018-12-05 21:03:33 Suggestion, great, for New Year's Eve! Instead of doing escargot in snail shells, Place each in a mushroom cap, complete with butter or olive oil and garlic. Add a sprinkle of breadcrumbs, and broil. Did I say wow?
1917 2018-12-05 21:03:23 #3 The Real OPEC?
Russia's oil production 11 million barrels has grown, it has sidled up to Saudi Arabia to coordinate output. 

The two countries discussed this at last weekend's G-20 summit meeting and will again try to formalize this side-deal on Friday after OPEC meets.
1918 2018-12-05 21:03:22 Any tips on anything that will protect hair from split ends if you swim a lot? Coconut oil seems to have little effect
1919 2018-12-05 21:03:20 So Walmart tells me my shipment got lost in transit....the order contained 7 jugs of 3L cooking oil and 5 bags of white sugar...quite the disappearing act lol~
1920 2018-12-05 21:03:16 We have other sources for oil...
We don't need Saudi...
We need healthcare for ALL
Middle Class TAX CUTS...
our COUNTRY needs a *REAL* LEADER...not one who sleeps with our enemies, for personal gain!!
1921 2018-12-05 21:03:15 1/2 According to the OPEC representative: Some member states believe that the reduction of oil production below 1 million barrels per day will be sufficient. 
The Vienna meeting on December 6 may not reach an agreement on the specific oil production cuts.
1922 2018-12-05 21:03:14 Fly tipping reported, thank you for that link... yes would be great if @BhamCityCouncil could get involved. The images don't do it justice; dozens to hundreds of full trash bags, tyres, solvent containers and oil... most overgrown so happening for years.
1923 2018-12-05 21:03:12 Don, what happened to Khashoggi was not ok. You traded oil for his life. Standing up for what’s right doesn’t mean we’d have higher gas prices. As we all see, they fluctuate daily and that won’t end by making nice with MBS. Be the bigger man. Do what’s right.
1924 2018-12-05 21:03:11 Inflated Real estate valuations yes!!!
 Inflated oil prices no way Jose !!!
1925 2018-12-05 21:03:10 “and have been making great strides in improving America’s environment.”
Your either delusional or a lier. (no doubt both) you gut USEPA authority to regulate green house gases, open up Alaska’s north for big oil exploration and deny that climate change is a fact.
1926 2018-12-05 21:03:08 voted 2 fast track TPP. 100% backs fracking (86 times worse than coal) & voted 2 repeal a 40 year law that limited oil exports, because America had 2 much oil reserves/2 increase oil profits. If U believe N climate change @BetoORourke should never B a possible presidential vote.

1929 2018-12-05 21:03:00 The people of Canada are paying 4.5 billion dollars to save and hopefully move this project along. Bitching about gov't and the hard working folks across Canada who support AB oil/gas is not helpful.
1930 2018-12-05 21:02:58 What's the cost for a barrel of oil? How much do taxpayers pay for oil? Why isn't there any outrage? People do what you allow them to do.
1931 2018-12-05 21:02:53 We can do better. Since 2016 the fed alone has hired over 40,000 workers, while shedding 20k oil and gas jobs. We also introduced C-69 and major corps cut over 5000 jobs in the last 60 days. 

Can 5.8% - 1.9% gdp growth
Aus 5.2% - 1.7%
UK 4. % - 1.14%
US 3.6 % - 2.1%

(US) Okuns?
1932 2018-12-05 21:02:47 God. The fear of the Lord must come back into the church. The lies, deception, selling your fools gold and oil snake books must stop. All insanity stop now. Return to know the truth of the bible. It's the word that's truth and power only.

1934 2018-12-05 21:02:43 I bet it is, but so is looking into the deep deep space, smashing particles, finding oil underground, and going faster than the speed of sound. If there is a will, we will do it if it is possible. People have being trying to prove ghosts since forever.
1935 2018-12-05 21:02:43 I gave my bff my new paint palette to drill a thumb hole in and they haven’t done it yet it’s been weeks so I have to use my dirty old oil palette to make dirty old art
1936 2018-12-05 21:02:28 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
1937 2018-12-05 21:02:28 Nope. There's a reason why load shedding doesn't happen on some days . We have the capacity but the electricity produced is expensive (mostly oil based) so not all of that potential is realized .
1938 2018-12-05 21:02:25 LMAOOOOOO im in the car with my Gma and she saw an ad on the car in front of us for cartridges, and she says to me “Lexi...what is a CBD oil..??”
1939 2018-12-05 21:02:24 It would be nice if researchers could focus on shale field costs/productivty per well, etc. Really uncover the business and shine a light on the health of oil production. Is the world tapped out or can we keep growing to handle 2020s. We need to create a longer term bull case.
1940 2018-12-05 21:02:23 So are you going to track her down as you did the Syrian bully. #DoubleStandards
1941 2018-12-05 21:02:20 Venezuelan President Maduro: Venezuela will sign a financial agreement and an oil agreement with Russia on December 6.

1947 2018-12-05 21:01:40 The possibility of Super OPEC (or OPEC+) substantially (that is, more than 1 million barrel per day) cutting their crude oil output is less than 50%.
1948 2018-12-05 21:01:31 Ha, bought some just today, grimly determined to turn them into something delicious. Olive oil, maple syrup, smoked paprika, a good long bake in the oven and the last few minutes some parmesan on top did the trick. It's a miracle!
1949 2018-12-05 21:01:28 #4 Will Qatar Crack The Cartel?
Speaking of splintering, this week Qatar said it will quit OPEC at the end of the year. It wants to focus more on natural gas than oil, but most suspect this move is more of a finger in the face of Saudi Arabia, who are at odds w/ each other

1963 2018-12-05 21:00:24 Actually it will. Because the people who win the elections and promptly DO NOT FUND EDUCATION win because they are able to martial millions of people to vote for them in exchange for bags of rice or bottles of cooking oil and eliminating those odds will give those people a chance

1967 2018-12-05 21:00:07 #5 Iraq is OPEC's biggest wildcard, and it doesn't want production cuts. And it likely can't cut. Revenue from selling oil accounts for nearly all of the war-torn nation's available cash.

Iraq needs the oil money more than any other OPEC member except Venezuela.

1972 2018-12-05 20:59:25 Ok not Germany, but Iceland is 200% renewable. Norway, a country rich with oil, is 96% renewable. Sudan and New Zealand are both 3/4 renewable. It’s possible!

1984 2018-12-05 20:58:14 Let's make a dressing oil. Roast them in a medium pan until they smell nice, then grind them with half a dozen dried chillies when they're cool enough. Then heat some oil until just bf it's smoking, then pour it over the ground mix. Strain when cool. Try w existing pepper.
1985 2018-12-05 20:58:13 I don't think that you understand how international oil pricing works.

1991 2018-12-05 20:57:44 Agreed, and it's a very subtle nod to the oil fields lol. As long as the city of Seattle likes the name, that's all that really matters. But c'mon, you gotta admit having the PA announcer yelling into mic "Release the Kraken" as team steps onto the ice sounds kinda bad ass! 
1992 2018-12-05 20:57:44 I sure wish I could do the no shampoo, but manufacture oil I have to shampoo every day 
1993 2018-12-05 20:57:28 The next smart move would be for exporters to raise OSP drastically and shove as much oil into storage vs. exporting it cheaply. Raising OSP wouldn't catch Trump's attention if they put the production in storage. Floating storage would be wise as well.

1996 2018-12-05 20:57:14 #IransanctionsTuesday Iran's President said that if Iran couldn't export oil from the Persian Gulf, no one could.Iran had the same position during the Iran-Iraq war. both countries allowed oil to be exported. This is not a new position for Iran.If Iran cannot export oil :war.

2009 2018-12-05 20:56:29 Higher oil prices leads to innovations in clean technology. This used to be an expanding market for the US #MAGAts
2010 2018-12-05 20:56:25 Taxes. They double the price with taxes, then you have environmentalists blocking pipelines which would make getting oil from remote areas cheaper.
2011 2018-12-05 20:56:15 Instead of adding CBD oil to be calm, maybe try subtracting the people who are trying to convince you the world is in a death spiral.

2017 2018-12-05 20:55:30 i'd have thought that for canada, reducing oil production is cheaper for them compared to other major oil producing countries.

this is because much of their crude is expensive to extract, and their economy doesn't rely on oil much, plus north america has a glut due to the usa
2018 2018-12-05 20:55:13 Christmas as an adult is whack.

2028 2018-12-05 20:54:19 argan oil/Moroccan oil will make your hair look shiny without greasiness
2029 2018-12-05 20:54:16 Make it illegal for oil companies to lie about climate change. Messaging fixed. Until that gets done no amount of careful framing will overcome the real problem.

2033 2018-12-05 20:53:59 And it also seems as usual we are so caught up in "accountability" for a certain period for a certain purpose...so the rest of the report can literally be thrown put because it is now irrelevant...even the years of oil/petrol issue seems overrun by a cake...must be the icing
2034 2018-12-05 20:53:58 Canada's emissions made up 1.6% of global emissions. China 25.9% and the US 13.9%. What do you think a few thousand cars will do? Electricity generating firms as well as oil and mineral extraction account for 62% of totals in Canada.
2035 2018-12-05 20:53:46 The big oil co's are cowards that caved in to the pressure and are now collaborating.
2036 2018-12-05 20:53:44 The Gulf War and Desert storm were based on lies in order for him to gain oil and money.
2037 2018-12-05 20:53:44 So... I was just finishing up making my hot oil treatment...when it ALL spills all over the table. 

Nigga, i wanna cry. Do you know how much money I just wasted. 
So of course i had to quickly take the paper towels it spilled on &rub it all over my hair. 

Now im making it again

2039 2018-12-05 20:53:25 Fucking oil cap handle has come off so I can't actually take the cap out. 
Fucking ridiculous cunty car and it somehow passed the MOT two months ago but now needs new pads. #ShitMOT
2040 2018-12-05 20:53:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
2041 2018-12-05 20:53:24 @lushcosmetics you ship products to customers using @UPS & @canadapostcorp last I checked they uses vehicles that require oil & gas. Are you bringing back the horse and buggy to go along with your protest on pipelines #selectiveprotestors #banlush #boycottlush
2042 2018-12-05 20:53:23 Thanks for that because Abka would have seen in the very report that there is no legal or operational framework that would have enable the  PS to know about missing oil unless same was in a report sent to her for the briefing of the Minister.
2043 2018-12-05 20:53:21 Bartrand likes to make me deal with the harbormaster. That man always smells like cod liver oil.
2044 2018-12-05 20:53:19 食パンさんおは莉緒ありです～～
2045 2018-12-05 20:53:15 Purchased at Lucas Oil Stadium itself. 
2046 2018-12-05 20:53:14 Already smelling the like the  midnight oil
2047 2018-12-05 20:53:12 More oil energy means a morons embrace of continuing unknowns
2048 2018-12-05 20:52:58 But SA wants to float 10% of their oil company in an IPO and reserves count as holdings.  Not disagreeing with you about the rest, but SA wants the price above $100
2049 2018-12-05 20:52:54 I’d rather run out of oil for my car and keep the electricity to power my home 
2050 2018-12-05 20:52:35 Lies all lies America produces 75-80 % of the oil we use! Hey did your friend The prince tell you say that? Asking for Mr. Mueller and all of law enforcement.
2051 2018-12-05 20:52:33 Are you sure you don’t have a leak? That is an absurd amount of oil to use
2052 2018-12-05 20:52:31 Being proactive rather than being hopeful would be a much stronger position to be in. What are you doing to ensure oil is not restricted or prices do not sky rocket. As leader of the country that is the end to which you should be negotiating being hopeful doesn’t get us anywhere
2053 2018-12-05 20:52:28 @WhiteHouse why don’t we get off foreign oil and move the US to sustainable and renewable energy sources? Everyone knows foreign oil is blood money
2054 2018-12-05 20:52:21 Pro tip: xtra mayo and oil and *no peppers then have sex with the sandwich
2055 2018-12-05 20:52:20 I did an avocado and honey face scrub, then a primrose oil mud mask and god my face feels great.
2056 2018-12-05 20:52:13 Tea tree oil is magic.
2057 2018-12-05 20:52:10 No snake oil salesman ever blamed the snake oil. The Brexit blame game is well underway and no Brexiter will be saying ‘Mea Culpa’.
2058 2018-12-05 20:52:04 #Oil #Canada No luck. Several major export pipelines shut down. Power outage caused by Saskatchewan  ice storm forced Enbridge shut down parts of Mainline system, reduce rates on sections. TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone pipeline also down.
2059 2018-12-05 20:52:02 How many joules do you use to forge new steel, transport it across an ocean, create new components, and dump it after <100K miles for frivolous social capital purposes/maintaining appearances? 

Where are these joules from: nuclear, coal, oil, natural gas, solar, wind, or hydro?
2060 2018-12-05 20:51:55 I need to top up the oil in my car and my warning light for my tyre has been on for days 
2061 2018-12-05 20:51:55 wow! I'd love to see the oil content in that!
2062 2018-12-05 20:51:49 oh I understand all that, I've been doing my best to poke at their story, what I'm asking is why Big Oil doesn't lay down context to help ppl understand the issue, thats how you grow support. we do it here, but we're individuals applying ourselves, why aren't they? They got $$$$$
2063 2018-12-05 20:51:48 one of the problems was the ships from "elsewhere" usually carry water as ballast, they have to dump this to take the oil onboard, who knows what parasites etc are in that sea water, it could effect the entire Scottish fisheries... forever
2064 2018-12-05 20:51:42 Not to forget 19 of the 911 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, but all is well as long as we buy oil.
2065 2018-12-05 20:51:40 OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES - SOPHIE, the epicentre to the evolution of experimental pop music
2066 2018-12-05 20:51:38 Brand new work shoes, oil and slip resistant. NOT Steel Toe. Pick up in Hollister.
2067 2018-12-05 20:51:37 All you liars out there saying how you went to heaven and floated around, see Jesus every other day, your demon lies will bring you to hell. Sid, selling your snake oil books. Other ones using falsity to build their kingdom up. This to all be ended soon. Soon real ones will be
2068 2018-12-05 20:51:36 Is it me or does Oil sound like salad fingers? "I collect nettles from the garden to make my gnocchi with my salad fingers" #mastercheftheprofessionals
2069 2018-12-05 20:51:35 You can get some infused oil to up the zing
2070 2018-12-05 20:51:19 Remember that time when America was supposed to be the leading oil producer 
2071 2018-12-05 20:51:18 The world is rapidly running out of oil.
2072 2018-12-05 20:51:17 Trudeau was forced to backtrack & reluctantly include discussion @ Premiers Meeting about Tens of Billions of Oil Revenue lost & Unemployment
Natives bitch & ask for more money & he attends their meeting to once again shake the Money Tree.
It’s painful watching a P M ruin Canada
2073 2018-12-05 20:51:12 it's also funny because Carter wanted more coal use and oil production in America, which is the sort of thing conservatives have been belly-aching about for decades
2074 2018-12-05 20:51:02 the place im getting my oil changed at is playing mambo #5 and it’s really taking me back
2075 2018-12-05 20:50:56 all my yogi friends beware....crow pose gets real treacherous when you're slathered in coconut oil
2076 2018-12-05 20:50:52 Or all lives are at stake and you should be watching the sky for asteroids! 

Now Bruce Willis doesn't know when its time to fly up to an asteroid and destroy it with moxy and space guns... thanks a lot Tim
2077 2018-12-05 20:50:43 expropriate natural resources such as gas and oil to properly fund education... it works trust me
2078 2018-12-05 20:50:41 Mushrooms sautéed in oil, add coconut milk & sherry. Top with nuts, especially pistachios flavored with salt, pepper, fennel seeds. Bake 30 min 375 or til toasted on top. Slice of heaven.
2079 2018-12-05 20:50:20 rosemary and olive oil or asiago cheese
2080 2018-12-05 20:50:19 Spaghetti squash with olive oil and herbs.   I like adding cheese, but I know that is out for vegans
2081 2018-12-05 20:50:15 Dump how much? 2barrles? Qatar is focusing on their gas. That’s about it. Gas prices are going up now so it would be good for them to focus on gas, instead of using it to inject oil out of the ground for $60 a barrel
2082 2018-12-05 20:50:08 Why even pretend you know how the oil market works?  It's pretty damn obvious you have a 5th grader's appreciation for global economics.
2083 2018-12-05 20:50:00 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2084 2018-12-05 20:49:57 the prince told Trudeau You want answers No oil for Quebec.
2085 2018-12-05 20:49:51 ha per ton is not the only criteria: 
You cannot grow palm oil plants in middle Europe. You can grow palm oil plants only in rainforest areas.
2086 2018-12-05 20:49:21 Coconut oil

Ejo MO ta laptops o
Both new and used
2087 2018-12-05 20:49:14 You know America is going down the shitter when the Germans are like “nah” about selling arms to a country who ordered a hit on a journalist and @realDonaldTrump is like “it good... I mean oil, amiright?” #wtf
2088 2018-12-05 20:49:08 I’m made out of oil, potatoes, and salt
2089 2018-12-05 20:49:04 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
2090 2018-12-05 20:49:03 all that cheap North Sea I oil so close yet so far
2091 2018-12-05 20:49:02 Peanut butter and coconut oil is a favourite with Bertie, Toby and Betty 
2092 2018-12-05 20:48:59 I’m in a lobby waiting getting my oil changed and WOW SOCIAL DISCOMFORT LEVEL 1000
2093 2018-12-05 20:48:43 OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES by SOPHIE because it's beautiful and jarring and weird and it bops so hard and there aren't enough adjectives to describe it. It's SOPHIE at the best she's ever been
2094 2018-12-05 20:48:30 I think he's picking winners and losers and he wants the farmers/autos to win which both need low oil prices. He won't win in Michigan without paying off auto workers. Those big trucks won't sell if gas prices rise.
2095 2018-12-05 20:48:28  I sometimes get the feeling I'm driving an oil tanker in the morning - that's just my old Clio though.
2096 2018-12-05 20:48:26 Just tell the rubes it's "Jobs" and ' It's the right #green thing to do" jobs are good, jobs =money, money = re-election!  You'll pay more, but hey it's green! Meanwhile (Same time period) we pump more #oil and #gas out of the ground then ever before AND CITIZENS STILL PAY MORE!
2097 2018-12-05 20:48:21 Some very powerful people may not want the story to bruk on the missing barrels of oil. Who benefitted from proceeds? Is there an oil black market? Who will be that journalist or police officer in JCF to uncover that story #PetrojamReport
2098 2018-12-05 20:48:16 The cold is really making my ankle stiff now that it has metal in it, feel like I need to use oil on it just like the tin man does in the wizard of oz
2099 2018-12-05 20:48:12 Our coconut oil has turned solid!! #LosAngelesColdFront
2100 2018-12-05 20:48:10 At this point in transportation history, the only thing we should be using oil for is lubrication of moving parts, not fuel, crankcase oil, and driveline fluids.

A smart president chooses clean energy.

A greed-corrupted president chooses fossil fuels.

And you're going to jail.
2101 2018-12-05 20:47:45 Big money is behind oil and gas industry. Not environmentalists lol
2102 2018-12-05 20:47:34 use the olive oil blondie recipe from my blog! before baking, mix together equal parts tahini and melted chocolate and swirl it through the batter! <3
2103 2018-12-05 20:47:34 No way is it you bobaxe. ...you are far too nice and you got a hole in one you told me. Anyway...they have been dealt with as far as Im concerned.
the Heid lives on an tweets on.
2104 2018-12-05 20:47:29 My mom has discovered CBD oil guys
2105 2018-12-05 20:47:27 Is that before the equalization robberies? Or after our oil and gas sector are gone completely?
2106 2018-12-05 20:47:24 Oil me brand.
2107 2018-12-05 20:47:20 Philip where do you think the energy efficiency programs get their funding from? Royalties plain and simple. Giving our oil to the US for nothing is only helping DT. If you think all these anti pipe protestors are there for the enviro you're wrong. Paid for by US lobbyists.
2108 2018-12-05 20:47:12 Fair, though people avoid generally driving nuclear reactors or oil tankers to work. Apart from oil tanker captains.
2109 2018-12-05 20:46:59 United States v. Pacific Western Oil Co.. (1806) Terrorism suspects are required for a search.
2110 2018-12-05 20:46:58 My Bro has won his 4 year battle against the ship to ship oil transfer in the Firth, he , along with many many others have been fighting against it and yesterday the Port Authority caved, outstanding result
2111 2018-12-05 20:46:58 I used the very last of my coconut oil... bitch my jumbo tub of Shea butter need to hurry up and get here ‘cause I’m is DRY from this winter weather.
2112 2018-12-05 20:46:57 Snake oil salesman
2113 2018-12-05 20:46:57 "The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!"
No, but OPEC does.  After all, why shouldn't they want to get rich too, at the expense of the rest of the world?
2114 2018-12-05 20:46:56 can dry cleaners remove oil stains?
2115 2018-12-05 20:46:53 I have some snake oil and bridges to sell, which I'll be offering at your event.
2116 2018-12-05 20:46:49 Can a team of only women build a skyscraper or a bridge over a wide river or an oil rig in the ocean or a highway across a mountain range?
2117 2018-12-05 20:46:47 I could eat kilo after kilo of radicchio lightly drizzled with sesame oil. IF ANYWHERE SOLD FUCKING RADICCHIO. (It’s in bags of mixed salad so I just buy those and throw the rest away. No one wants rocket )
2118 2018-12-05 20:46:46 Portabello Mushroom burger. So easy, very popular with my meat-friendly circle. Rub the portobellos with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook ~ 4-5 min/side, add 1.5 T balsamic vinegar for another minute, until reduces by half. Array of fixings.
2119 2018-12-05 20:46:36 Try castor oil.
2120 2018-12-05 20:46:12 Sorry its mutually exclusive
2121 2018-12-05 20:46:12 He is opposed to clean energy, so if he can use the cfb to do big oil’s bidding he is for that.
2122 2018-12-05 20:46:09 I’ve tried Reiki & I’ve tried CBD oil along side my medication. Great combination for me, personally! @Label1tv can you see the thread? Adults with ADHD are experiencing bullying, people who question the validity of the disorder, pill shaming.
2123 2018-12-05 20:46:07 Neither does my oil. We can be spotted together lol
2124 2018-12-05 20:46:05 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2125 2018-12-05 20:46:01 The Libs are just bullshit artists, Margaret,  they have been wanking "surplus" for five years; Hockey wanked that promise before he handed down his only budget. There is no chance the current idiots will do any better, they are snake oil salesmen, no substance, no integrity.
2126 2018-12-05 20:45:53 If they do sir, then start pumping oil like no tomorrow and force prices down.

We need 2 more refinerys almost as much as need that #BuildTheDamnWall
#MAGA
2127 2018-12-05 20:45:46 Me I would make a pot of beans with corn on the cob, coleslaw and sliced tomatoes sprinkled with oil and viniger Then Apple pie.
2128 2018-12-05 20:45:46 Pakistan decided for coal power projects as it has huge coal reserves in Thar area of Sindh to overcome acute electricity shortage. It is exploring gas, oil reserves also besides constructing nuclear power plants with Chinese help.
2129 2018-12-05 20:45:41 I feel that most of the Chinese work is extremely contemporary due to the old ways of China to refute most western ideas. Figurative Oil Painting being European So classical Chinese to me would be influenced Daoism? But yes, Chinese paintings today are amazing. Off the Chart.
2130 2018-12-05 20:45:39 The time is NOW to invest in renewable resources for the future & start to decrease dependence on oil. I know you don't care about the future, the deficit, the environment since it will be someone else's issue Just putting it out there in case you feel like doing something good!
2131 2018-12-05 20:45:35 Heating oil is crazy expensive. Time to think of an air source heat pump.
2132 2018-12-05 20:45:33 I was washing my hands in the bathroom and I just witnessed a girl go into the stall to get the toilet seat cover and then come back to the mirror and oil blot her face LOL that’s actually smart 
2133 2018-12-05 20:45:32 @trish_regan, I agree that the Oil companies should feel bad for bilking tax payers out of $3 billion in welfare.
2134 2018-12-05 20:45:32 Man Gone She Tryna Slick A Can Of Oil 
2135 2018-12-05 20:45:24 A snake oil salesman
2136 2018-12-05 20:45:21 agree cash would be more than current cap with no debt even if oil was slammed in that time.
2137 2018-12-05 20:45:17 We need to divest from oil and move toward green energy. We need to cut oil subsidies and subsidize renewable energy systems. Oil companies are killing our planet.
2138 2018-12-05 20:45:16 @realDonaldTrump Just a suggestion, a good one, I think. You need a little humor now.  Can't hurt, especially w/Prince Mohammed bin Salman's dealing w/Putin on oil, an idiot for that, will be taken advantage of in no time, but you're better than letting this get to you.
2139 2018-12-05 20:45:16 Everything about the body oil I got out my advent calendar is amazing. I never want it to finish! I smell SO GOOD
2140 2018-12-05 20:45:09 May 9th 2011 gas price national average under Obama $3.965 per gallon! How could u forget this?? By the way the United States is now the worlds largest oil producer.
2141 2018-12-05 20:45:06 Its a good one! I also love avobath and the little bath oil you’ve been mangoed together, smells divine and so softening!
2142 2018-12-05 20:45:05 Lower oil prices are not going to be your saving grace. You are on your way out.
2143 2018-12-05 20:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2144 2018-12-05 20:45:00 How that could be ah oil down........
2145 2018-12-05 20:44:47 Because they say whatever might benefit them at any given moment. OPEC is the only one responsible for oil and gas prices, btw.
2146 2018-12-05 20:44:46 FYI Alberta oil gave billions of dollars from oil profits to the rest of Canada for many years. If you don't know what you are talking about, please keep out of the conversation.
2147 2018-12-05 20:44:39 I don't think he did believe the prince.  I think he just didn't care.  He wanted saudi oil and he wanted saudi to buy us weapons.  USA should start using Venezuelan oil.  They have the largest reserves in the world.
2148 2018-12-05 20:44:34 It's salonpas and efficasent oil season again
2149 2018-12-05 20:44:25 So who needs to buy USD to be able to purchase oil, when you could use your local currency to buy XRP and settle with whoever on the other side of the world ? ( or an equal amount of coal, or grain, or manufactured goods or whatever of value as a trade that XRP can facilitate)
2150 2018-12-05 20:43:53 It came be any better than CBD Oil and thunder suit. At least they work for 6 of my dogs. #naturaltreatment
2151 2018-12-05 20:43:48 The Bush family got deep ties to oil and the CIA. They can never be trusted. Ever.
2152 2018-12-05 20:43:37 ... and then I doubled down on Saudi Oil and completely killed #EnergyEast #PartTimeDramaTeacher #MakeTrudeauADramaTeacherAgain
2153 2018-12-05 20:43:34 idea to declare war. Especially without us being attacked first and not retaliating, we can't even imagine doing to gain access to territory or to keep the oil/gas price low.

We are perhaps also less brave, more diplomatic if you pick the most positive description.
2154 2018-12-05 20:43:22 Sniff olbas oil, take plenty of honey & lemon, & several whisky based hot  toddys! Get well soon amigo 
2155 2018-12-05 20:43:22 There was a lot of self-service in that service. He never forgot his oil buddies. And he ran the CIA during Operation Condor. Nothing fine, decent, or remotely human about that. Trump is a shitstain on American history WITHOUT the revisionism.
2156 2018-12-05 20:43:19 I can tell I'm trying to quit smoking cause somebody just tried to tell me to do something on the line and I almost threw hot oil at them
2157 2018-12-05 20:43:08 Brake oil
2158 2018-12-05 20:43:03 Alexandria Casio - 'Frisbee' - Cortez does'nt have a grasp for basic economics.  'This is'nt Mr. Smith goes to Washington'...how about 'Olive Oil' or 'Sweet Pea' goes to Washington.  (And that's being kind) !
2159 2018-12-05 20:42:57 Hah no i just didnt pay for heating from april-november as it wasnt cold and used electric heaters! But we didnt need to get it from oct until feb this year after moving in as it lasted that long. Maybe ive ordered cheaper oil. Def checking for leaks/theft
2160 2018-12-05 20:42:45 Lmao. I ruin all my clothes with oil from cooking 
2161 2018-12-05 20:42:31 what oil are you using? 
2162 2018-12-05 20:42:28 There must be oil or something in Iran ???
2163 2018-12-05 20:42:23 excuse me....
OMG I'M GONNA SACRIFICE MY NIGHTS burning the midnight oil for sure my a week winter break later gonna be WORTH IT geez this is like spm kinda level FH
2164 2018-12-05 20:42:14 Lol. Earlier i was driving back to Abj and something in my mind just flicked.
Because we're in December, something felt unusual...the absence of fuel scarcity.
Then BOOM! I came on twitter and I'm seeing that oil marketers are threatening to shut down depots.
Welcome to December!
2165 2018-12-05 20:42:02 Wouldn't what you're saying apply equally to volcanos? Human use of oil, coal, and natural gas releases 120 times more co2 than all of the volcanos on Earth in a single year. 

US commuter traffic alone, when I low-ball it, releases almost 50% more than everyone volcano on earth
2166 2018-12-05 20:42:00 Got my oil changed today and while I was waiting I think I figured out my top 50 albums of 2018. I don't plan on sharing them with anybody, just wanted yall to know I did it. And definitely don't recommend any other albums to me. 2018 is over and I can't listen to anything else.
2167 2018-12-05 20:42:00 nerves of oil
2168 2018-12-05 20:41:55 @realDonaldTrump  Canada sends us more oil than Saudi Arabia. We don't need Saudi oil you fool!
2169 2018-12-05 20:41:47 they get crispy, the only thing is you don't get that oil flavor so some things might taste a bit less good. but also makes it healthier for you. it's super great for like, frozen nuggets and stuff like that though. things your oven just reheats
2170 2018-12-05 20:41:45 How he can afford dinner in brickell but not tea tree oil smh all niggas do is lie
2171 2018-12-05 20:41:34 Follow the missing barrels of oil... more news deh deh so... leave di cake alone fi now... #PetrojamReport
2172 2018-12-05 20:41:31 Sis you just reminded me I have to get my oil changed got damn
2173 2018-12-05 20:41:30 I need two new tires and an oil change and two places I called quoted me over 250... so I’m still looking. Any suggestions??
2174 2018-12-05 20:41:16 Ex-Hong Kong Official Convicted in Bribe Case Involving Chinese Oil Company
2175 2018-12-05 20:41:06 Where’s it leaking from.? Seems #Oman has found a big oil & gas reserve insha ALLAH.
2176 2018-12-05 20:41:05 We owe hanlen an apologies for what? 

He sold us a "new and improved Markelle Fultz" and that was a boldfaced lie. Drew Hanlen is a snake oil salesman.
2177 2018-12-05 20:41:04 Being #Canadian right now is frustrating. More so an #Albertan. Not being able to get our products to market, on the verge of yet another recession and with no help from @JustinTrudeau. Buying Saudi oil instead of pipelines east... we need to do better... China buying US LNG.....
2178 2018-12-05 20:40:33 I always see those in the store is it really frying as well without oil??
2179 2018-12-05 20:40:29 We don’t need them. We make enough oil ourselves now.
2180 2018-12-05 20:40:29 Even better news: the pipeline capacity of the Permian oil fields will double in late 2019.  Houston's going to boom.
2181 2018-12-05 20:40:28 You got it, Breck. The media said Bush started the Middle East war because of oil...
They said Bush was in the oil business and wanted the war to make money for himself.... They also constantly referred to Bush as a wimp...

2184 2018-12-05 20:40:11 It is so damn disrespectful, disingenuous and dishonourable the way you mislead people. Conservatives screwed the Pipeline approval, OPEC is keeping oil prices down and conservatives (You, Harper, PCAA) failed to get 1 single pipeline to tide. Hence selling at such low price.
2185 2018-12-05 20:40:11 We don't produce that amount of co2 by breathing Casey, it's produced by burning oil, coal, and natural gas. We can breathe all we darn well please, that's not what is causing climate change.
2186 2018-12-05 20:40:10 I don't think Portugal gets enough credit. They basically enabled Japan to invent tempura by giving them oil. I really appreciate being able to stuff my face with greasy & fried food, so thank you Portugal.

2192 2018-12-05 20:39:56 What we need to to make individual homes more energy independent so the grid does not need to be our only source of energy watch the oil prices drop.  Oil companies would beg you to buy their oil.  I cut cooking gas from my life next is gasoline..and so on ...
2193 2018-12-05 20:39:39 I wish it was evident what anyone could do?  Even with TMPL in at maybe 2 years we'll stiĺl be selling our oil at a discount, albeit less of a discount than we have now.
2194 2018-12-05 20:39:37 Gee, I dunno, Donnie... I think you and Saudia Arabia are gonna have to torture and kill several more US-based journalists to really get oil down lower. Then again, anybody except FOX News' Entertainers is fair game for you.
2195 2018-12-05 20:39:34 I’m trying to CBD oil myself into a nap because I have a million things to do and no energy to do a single one
2196 2018-12-05 20:39:32 Oil change, cleaning & putting up some Christmas decorations, then homework. Let’s hope this day is productive as I’m setting it up to be & I don’t just fall asleep like always hahaha
2197 2018-12-05 20:39:28 Да ты шо
2198 2018-12-05 20:39:27 Lol. I guess that's why pension funds, insurance companies, banks, etc are divesting from the Alberta oil sands. I wonder, with their trillions of $ to invest, why they aren't listening to CAPP that they're the best in the world. So confusing.
2199 2018-12-05 20:39:24 I feel for his loss, but he was a war monger who surrounded himself with war mongers. No blood for oil!
2200 2018-12-05 20:39:23 We need to reduce the consumption of oil. We are killing our world if we do as you say D Trump.  Higer prices are a tool to reduce pollution.
2201 2018-12-05 20:39:01 Opec nations along with Russia will cut oil production rebuffing Trump's request to increase production. Trump's covering up for the Saudi Crown Prince's murder of WAPO journelist Jamaal Kashoggi hasn't benefited Trump. Putin, the Saudi Prince nor XI are your friends Mr President
2202 2018-12-05 20:39:01 All you need is a hard brush, a Durag and some cantu wave oil.

2206 2018-12-05 20:38:32 May there be a leak in the oil tank? Know 2 people that’s happened to.
2207 2018-12-05 20:38:22 Valerie(my car) ain’t ready for snow, my baby need some new tires and is due for an oil change
2208 2018-12-05 20:38:19 Governor Dunleavy serves at the pleasure of the voters of Alaska, not at the pleasure of the president, not at the pleasure of the oil companies or the gas companies. He represents all Alaskans. That means we have the right to access account to speak with him on Twitter.
2209 2018-12-05 20:38:15 Yeah cause he thinking “shit the 79 oil crisis was more intense than this front row awkwardness”

2212 2018-12-05 20:37:55 Do we think this is serious enough to bring it to the mechanic? The mechanic of course thinks it is. I think maybe tire pressure and gas and a nice long drive might do the trick. Battery is brand new. Doesn’t need an oil change.
2213 2018-12-05 20:37:46 You’ve misheard - first it was oil money and that’s because they’re so good. Don’t worry though.
2214 2018-12-05 20:37:45 If you sell a property with oil and mineral rights, you also have to deal with the oil and mineral rights!  Unless you keep those for yourself.  Barf.
2215 2018-12-05 20:37:30 Use cannabis oil by "phoenix tears-Rick Simpson". You can do  it  yourself at home using 95% alcohol and THC it's good for human and animals
2216 2018-12-05 20:37:27 Yes, all protesters are polluters and  are bad anyone having to do with extraction or transport of oil or gas is good.  Typical Trumpette.
2217 2018-12-05 20:37:24 Correct... they hated him and his oil tycoon buddy....the dems hated him also.  So when he is dead then praise him.... nothing more than two faced bastards —- all of them.

2220 2018-12-05 20:37:09 That’s because they’re backed by an oil state and we’re not.
2221 2018-12-05 20:37:09 Kinda like having an oil lobbyist run the EPA.
2222 2018-12-05 20:37:03 That wont work to well. Force women to do the hard outside manual labor, 50/50 equals. Sorry women who wish to be nurses or mothers, you have to go work the mines and oil fields because it has to be 50/50... lmfao that's going to work
2223 2018-12-05 20:36:57 i really forget i have my cbd oil with me at all time and stress relief is just one click away
2224 2018-12-05 20:36:53 A white mans tears must be as rare as diamonds! How many Iraqi children were killed, crippled & were orphaned for oil that GWB and other politicians did not did not shed one tear for, when they went to a war based on lies.
2225 2018-12-05 20:36:45 ....and then I thanked him for selling us his unethical Saudi oil.
2226 2018-12-05 20:36:36 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
2227 2018-12-05 20:36:34 I bet ya Russia played right into the yellow vests “movement”- they want oil, not renewable energy. Just my 2centa
2228 2018-12-05 20:36:31 Hopefully OQEP will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The Galaxy does not want to see, or need, higher quantium prices!
2229 2018-12-05 20:36:24 Getting rid of an oil tank and I can't give the unused oil away. Some will charge to pump and dump it, but nobody sees value in the fuel. How about we avoid an environmental hazard and help families heat simultaneously? #recycle #wecandobetter
2230 2018-12-05 20:36:22 Wow this is sad. Telling women it will happen. Hold the damn oil companies responsible when it does.
2231 2018-12-05 20:36:19 We should not trade a life for cheap oil!!!!!

2233 2018-12-05 20:36:10 I don't think happiness and feminism go together. oil and water.
2234 2018-12-05 20:36:02 So the US imposed sanctions on Russia keeping them from drilling for oil on their own soil? Russia can drill for all the oil they want on their soil. Dolt!

2240 2018-12-05 20:35:19 Lol I make it sound a lot more sketch than it actually was. The guy has an actual office it’s just that he uses that to go to like oil fields and stuff when those dudes never go home

2245 2018-12-05 20:34:49 The world needs a move away from oil and toward ecologically benign sources like wind and solar, which were hugely profitable and vibrant before you.
2246 2018-12-05 20:34:44 if your car takes regular/synthetic blend oil like 3-4000 miles, if it takes a full synthetic closer to 7500. air filters and stuff probably don’t need to be done every oil change but it’s never bad to do. other major thing to watch is Coolant level
2247 2018-12-05 20:34:23 @IcelandFoods thank you for bringing out your own palm oil free bread! I have been looking for a normal sliced loaf for ages that is free of palm oil and E numbers since my usual brand started to include these ingredients. Bread is a simple food that should be kept simple!
2248 2018-12-05 20:34:18 hopefully I get an oil change today
2249 2018-12-05 20:34:16 If the NCAA had brains they would have moved that game to Lucas Oil Stadium in Indy . They'd actually have fan bases there. Why play in California now with two midwest schools ?
2250 2018-12-05 20:33:57 George Bush deserves to suffer the loss of his father so he knows what he put the families through of the 4, 400 servicemen killed in the Iraq War on his LIE over the oil in Iraq! It strange how  Bush's father receives attention at the funeral, while 4,400 Servicemen are ignored.

2253 2018-12-05 20:33:40 Oriana Fallaci, in her book 'The Force of Reason', described how Gaddafi & Boumediene in the early '60s devised the plan for the influx of moslems into Europe & its destruction. Europe would receive a steady supply of oil, and Europe would allow Arab 'workers' to move to Europe.
2254 2018-12-05 20:33:36 the only other thing you can do that will help is to put Tea Tree Oil into his shampoo. That is a natural deterrent as well!
2255 2018-12-05 20:33:17 oh! Fun. Take a whole cauliflower. Rub with miso, peanut oil, ginger and garlic powder. Salt it a little (miso is already salty). Roast it in a pan w some water at 325 for 3 hours. Crank heat to broil for last few minutes. It will be scorched and crunchy outside, tender inside.
2256 2018-12-05 20:33:16 Kinda yes. Him restricting oil and coal created Fracking. It's cheaper, cleaner and is replacing coal. Unfortunately once Fracking became a thing he tried to ban that too.
2257 2018-12-05 20:33:13 Damn who knew getting an oil change would be so damn expensive....
2258 2018-12-05 20:33:12 Amin ya Allah
2259 2018-12-05 20:33:10 I cried to get the murderer of over 5,000 American in Iraq and over 3,000 Americans in 9/11, otherwise great eulogy of his father, a much better President than this slacker off the podium! So many families didn't have their sons and daughters come home from a war for oil $!
2260 2018-12-05 20:33:09 Ya by leaving Iraq it’s oil! He was weak! Gave us eight years of Clinton tranny! Trump would’ve won easy

2264 2018-12-05 20:32:53 And we will have this freedom no longer in very short order thanks to the pervasive unwillingness to even consider change. Enjoy the auto induced oil apocalypse. I encourage you do get some bicycles as part of your emergency preparedness kit.
2265 2018-12-05 20:32:53 I make my own detangle spray with tea tree oil, conditioner, and water.  The tea tree oil is supposed to deter the lice and good for my kids hair.  Not sure if good for your kiddos, but something like that might help for prevention too!
2266 2018-12-05 20:32:51 This tweet has the same energy as someone who got a major in musical theater, gets an internship at an oil and gas firm, then cites the wage gap as the reason they aren't paid as much as the dude with the four year in mechanical engineering.
2267 2018-12-05 20:32:50 $1.99??? Where??? We're still at $3.00 a gallon in Colorado
 And the f*cked up part is we have oil wells drilling oil all over the state!!!
2268 2018-12-05 20:32:48 My view is that Manchin would be Oil/Gas best case and Im not for it.   I'll add, criticism is more broad in that I am suspect of the sponsored content lineup of Axios and how that can intersect with the news content, its a general fear in media.  Those sponsors are public
2269 2018-12-05 20:32:47 Yes.. It's not the cost of environmental protection... Its placing that cost squarely on the backs of working families while oil and energy profits soar untouched.
2270 2018-12-05 20:32:43 Quite agree. The costs of exploration and extraction can make certain oil reserves unprofitable (eg oil sands or North Sea).  Oil companies cease extraction resulting in job losses in both direct and peripheral support and supply vendors. But that stable price needs to be there.
2271 2018-12-05 20:32:43 Hi friends. I don't like cbd oil. I saw you guys talking about it and had been thinking about trying it. Don't like it.
2272 2018-12-05 20:32:42 WOW! Well done, I looked after the operating software on the IBM mainframes in the oil company QGPC  Ras Abu-Aboud in the mid-nineties, can't recognise the place!
2273 2018-12-05 20:32:38 We don't need there oil anymore
2274 2018-12-05 20:32:32 @chrissinerantzi Sweet potato in general is slightly more nutritious than white potato it has more vitamin A & has a lower glycemic index, which helps to keep you fuller for longer Sweet potato fries are no healthier if they’re deep fried and/or cooked in oil with lots of salt!
2275 2018-12-05 20:32:24 The most? This the same as leftists taking a very narrow view of historical figures, lacking full context that justifies things like taking down statues? The story is fine, headline sucks.
2276 2018-12-05 20:32:21 My car definitely looks like I live in it and I’m getting an oil change, there’s no doubt in my mind the mechanics are talking shit about it 
2277 2018-12-05 20:32:12 The motor oil drizzle 
2278 2018-12-05 20:32:11 besides, isn't Canada our biggest source of imported oil?
2279 2018-12-05 20:31:59 Flu is back 

Funny how it returns after I stop taking the high doses of Cannabis oil
2280 2018-12-05 20:31:58 The feds are doing nothing to help the oil sector but would anyone be surprised if a bailout for the auto sector will be announced in the very near future?
2281 2018-12-05 20:31:56 Build the dam pipelines. But no we would rather import millions of dollars of Saudi Oil and at the same time cheapen our own natural resource, putting our workers out of jobs. Get rid of the carbon tax until the real culprits India China etc meet their quota's.
2282 2018-12-05 20:31:55 Yes, and just like the policies at every oil site, drug testing is NOT random, it occurs only upon hiring and after individual involvement in a safety incident.

2299 2018-12-05 20:30:28 It's Scotland's oil, you know 
2300 2018-12-05 20:30:25 We only get 30% of our oil from OPEC. We could eliminate our need for their oil by clean renewable energy. Windmills, solar, recyclables
2301 2018-12-05 20:30:14 Or we can make him the Chattanooga Best Western Heritage  hardcore champion, & have it 24/7 defense rules. You go to sleep, you lose the strap & get covered in baby oil & dosed.
2302 2018-12-05 20:30:03 Refined Oil - once Texas discovered the Wolfcamp oil reservoir ( largest oil find of all time) it changed everything in Alberta. The US no longer is depending on crude oil. They have all the refineries. Canadian gas? Easier to find Canadian coffee
2303 2018-12-05 20:29:58 И снова ниразу не попали(((
2304 2018-12-05 20:29:52 @tatisnailsxoxo what olive oil do you use to soak your nails?
2305 2018-12-05 20:29:52 Exactly.
2306 2018-12-05 20:29:49 Wanting to try a new brand of CBD oil anyone have any suggestions??
2307 2018-12-05 20:29:44 Sadly yes !!!! I’m a vegan so I don’t tend to buy chocolate !!! However this was given to my son !!! And I cannot change that I tend to buy palm oil free foods
2308 2018-12-05 20:29:38 How gid is baby oil in ur bath but, smoooth ass legs
2309 2018-12-05 20:29:26 Now why on Earth would he do that? Then his rich oil buddies wouldn’t be making as much money!
2310 2018-12-05 20:29:16 Everyone’s hating on palm oil but no one has even read WWF stance on why other types of substitute oils can be even worse and that the solution is not to boycott but to push for better and more sustainable ways of growing it.
2311 2018-12-05 20:28:59 It's been a while I read stories like these: $1bn recovered in grave yard.$2m recovered from ikoyi house. N100m retrieved from minister's girlfriend bank account. N400b lost in Airport contract. Minister diverts Oil money. Pastor buys private jet.
2312 2018-12-05 20:28:39 Know where Arnold can travel to, Russia he can go back to his home land and tell Putin how to extract oil,
2313 2018-12-05 20:28:33 I will say that if PM handles this in the way it should be handled (swiftly and transparently) it could work out fi unoo in the end. But this, i think is the tip of the oil well
2314 2018-12-05 20:28:26 imagine slathering a hairless lane in baby oil and feeding him ecstasy and letting him loose at the chattanooga best western. whoever catches him and retains possession for a ten count wins $1200.
2315 2018-12-05 20:28:25 $CL_F traders.    OPEC & inventories tomorrow.   Both can make trading oil difficult if you use tight stops.   Big stops too
2316 2018-12-05 20:28:21 I done got my oil changed, fuel injection, and tires rotated. Washed my car and vacuumed. I need a nap.
2317 2018-12-05 20:28:18 Let's control our own prices for oil we have enough oil. We don't have to put our oil on the world market
2318 2018-12-05 20:28:02 RE would be viable if we work towards it. Instead, we continue subsidizing oil and gas upwards of $20 billion a year. Who do you think advocates for these subsidies and manipulates the cost-benefit analyses of renewable energy to make them look bad? Hint: One’s running the EPA.
2319 2018-12-05 20:27:51 I was joking x
2320 2018-12-05 20:27:48 You people are so damn gullible it’s a wonder you can function at all. The Liberals have certainly made mistakes but let’s be honest and call out Harper for screwing the pipeline process up and OPEC for the low oil price. #abpoli #cdnpoli
2321 2018-12-05 20:27:32 Aa Saide Mr. Jibrin
2322 2018-12-05 20:27:31 Many things but the main thing is to keep the batter wetter and get the oil hottt
2323 2018-12-05 20:27:05 Everyone's greed need to be checked. All corporations, Pharma, and politicians who are constantly taking money from big oil companies need to be held accountable for their enormous greed!! This Country has gone insane!!
2324 2018-12-05 20:27:04 Would he help with the oil lamps?
2325 2018-12-05 20:27:04 Can’t out slick a can of oil. 
2326 2018-12-05 20:27:04 Or at least buy a condom ...
2327 2018-12-05 20:26:56 If only we had that kind of power to fight against planetary destruction because of our overreliance on oil and fossil fuel infrastructure
2328 2018-12-05 20:26:55 Many other Countries don't have coal, oil, gas and hydro/geothermal we are blessed with. UN IPCC has been pressuring away from fossil fuels on false premise so some are going nuclear. China also in that market. Just taking opportunities.
2329 2018-12-05 20:26:53 If you would have stopped pandering to the coal, oil and gas lobbyists, we could have moved forward with other environmentally friendly options. If there’s another energy crisis here, it’s all on you, imbecile.
2330 2018-12-05 20:26:51 Mr. President..why not uncover the hidden technologies of energy the deep state hides along with many other technologies we all know. The ones that research anyway. We really don’t need oil and combustible engines.Only the power,control and greed group is holding us back! Get em’
2331 2018-12-05 20:26:44 No I would love a Koala they are so sweet. And I said earlier my closest to Australia was watching neighbours. Never used to miss an episode, That was my Australian Fix. Loved it.

2333 2018-12-05 20:26:41 Jeremy Corbyn is the best thing that has ever happened to this country, watch his daily messages on Twitter, don't believe the media as they have there interest in oil money, the media mogals pay no tax in this country, this includes all of the Tory party MPs, #JC4PMNow
2334 2018-12-05 20:26:41 Sending prayers to stay seizure free and a full recovery! Also praying that the NCAA updates their rules about the use of cannabis oil. 
2335 2018-12-05 20:26:39 Vitamins & canola oil are super good.
2336 2018-12-05 20:26:36 @Alex_S_Cullen Do you realize how much oil byproduct you use in a day?
2337 2018-12-05 20:26:33 look at me being responsible and setting an appointment for an oil change instead of going home and taking a nap.
2338 2018-12-05 20:26:23 デスゲーム参加して死んでたけど雨の音で現実に戻ってきた

2339 2018-12-05 20:26:19 Raging. The cottage where I live in Scotland runs off oil for heating, and after not needing any since April, 250 quids worth has lasted me a month. And i dont have the heat on all the time either. Take me back to gas
2340 2018-12-05 20:26:09 i’ve heard all the rave about cbd oil and am going to look into becoming a customer! hopefully the products are affordable for me
2341 2018-12-05 20:26:01 We don’t need oil period!! #BuhByeOPEC
2342 2018-12-05 20:25:58 Yea I learned this the hard way, but apparently just adding oil doesn’t have the same affect of changing it  the old oils has to be flushed out and replaced or else the gunk can lock your engine
2343 2018-12-05 20:25:49 #FeelTheBern said that?!?
2344 2018-12-05 20:25:45 Do tears work as a substitute for linseed oil? 

Let’s find out
2345 2018-12-05 20:25:36 Use cuticle oil. It's really inexpensive and it makes your fingers look a lot more clean.
2346 2018-12-05 20:25:36 B.C. government unveils its new climate and clean growth plan. Included: in 10 yrs all new homes and buildings will be low carbon;  in 20 yrs all new cars sold in BC must be zero emission;  Generating more clean electricity and renewable fuels,  burning less oil and gas. #bcpoli
2347 2018-12-05 20:25:29 "In my day, he [Obama] would be serving us coffee"

I bet HuffPo didn't mention that quote.
2348 2018-12-05 20:25:01 este es otro tarado mas
2349 2018-12-05 20:24:57 no matter what else happens today i changed my own oil and that makes me powerful.
2350 2018-12-05 20:24:54 From sweet tortas de Inés Rosales, made with olive oil, to soft molletes de Antequera buns, the Andalusians' baking prowess never ceases to amaze me. I just love it all.
2351 2018-12-05 20:24:48 I worked in the oil industry for a short time. It's just as bad.
2352 2018-12-05 20:24:42 You know that oil and gas reserves around the world are dwindling... Renewable energy is where government investments need to be focused!!
2353 2018-12-05 20:24:35 @arcadiain @Jtrip we most def have to watch trump wants cheaper oil prices
2354 2018-12-05 20:24:34 I’ve had enough of canola oil stans
2355 2018-12-05 20:24:33 oil... dark magic....
2356 2018-12-05 20:24:31 Interesting, but why does the article not tell how much is from oil?
2357 2018-12-05 20:24:20 Oil spills occur occasionally and by accident.  Windmills kill raptors every day - as a fundamental flaw in their design.
2358 2018-12-05 20:24:17 Ok
2359 2018-12-05 20:24:05 As someone who knows nothing about hair, but who likes to mouth off, I'm going to suggest soaking your hair in some sort of fluid that doesn't evaporate quickly.  Like oil, glycerin, or corn syrup.
2360 2018-12-05 20:23:58 Since the United States is the world's largest producer of crude oil, according to the Energy Department we have more control over keeping oil flowing. Of course, @realDonaldTrump doesn't know this because he is uniformed. Trump is the most incompetent president ever. #LockHimUp
2361 2018-12-05 20:23:52 How about thinking of new technology, eventually oil supplies will run out. But you are not a forward thinker are you Crooked Donald!
2362 2018-12-05 20:23:48 As a former Bridgestone employee, I try to be loyal and use Firestone shops for auto maintenance but it’s been a major ordeal to get an apt for oil change/tire rotation and now there’s no one here who can look at a check engine light?
2363 2018-12-05 20:23:45 When will our federal and provincial governments end the obscenity of  tax deductions for contributions to political parties? The current  system of refundable tax credits forces taxpayers to subsidize what are  really just private organisations. #cdnpoli
2364 2018-12-05 20:23:32 name someone more negative than your own damn car asking for an oil change. go
2365 2018-12-05 20:23:28 You never trumpers don’t realize if we had trump then we’d have taken Iraq’s oil never had to raize taxes and never gotten to endure the Clinton years! Trumps a true leader unlike the cowardly bush 41 and 43! It takes guts to take the oil!
2366 2018-12-05 20:23:23 Maybe you could get one on Gumtree....boom tsch!
2367 2018-12-05 20:23:20 The thing is with CBD Oil, when you purchase something like this you don’t know what your getting, but this deserves a good reference because it work’s, all I can say is try it.
2368 2018-12-05 20:23:12 Sounds good!  Avocado toast with garlic, oregano, basil, and olive oil.  I will have some please  
2369 2018-12-05 20:23:11 What part of that isn't true? If he's getting bribed by the oil industry how can we expect him to fight back against the oil industry? Are you really that dense?
2370 2018-12-05 20:23:11 If anyone wants to get me anything for Christmas... just pay my credit card off and get me an oil change ... please and thank you
2371 2018-12-05 20:23:10 It needs to use less oil, and pricing is one way to do that.
2372 2018-12-05 20:23:08 Put on some anointing oil bro, So you can have a goodnight sleep.
2373 2018-12-05 20:22:41 such a twat for forgetting that you DONT put water on hot oil. 
the oil went everywhere an a burnt my face right off
2374 2018-12-05 20:22:34 Yes sir. With your real oil brushes 
2375 2018-12-05 20:22:16 Oil
Brent crude fell by US52 cents or 0.8% to US$61.56 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US36 cents or 0.7% to US$52.89 a barrel.

2376 2018-12-05 20:22:09 Nikola Tesla was giving Free Energy to the world over 100 years ago.  It was stopped by the Oil, Gas and Electric  companies couldn't meter it . They had his research hidden after he died , in favour of the mighty Dollar etc. The technology exists but corporations won't allow it.
2377 2018-12-05 20:22:05 Have u been to that car shop/bbq place in town? I've never gone but the thought of eating pulled pork while they change your oil has always been funny to me
2378 2018-12-05 20:22:01 Had to laugh as I began reading Company News 7am this morning. Eco Atlantic reporting, that sounds interesting think I, I wonder what aspect of eco they cover? Lo and behold an oil drilling company!! The cynicism of hydrocarbon producers never ceases to amaze.
2379 2018-12-05 20:21:58 Someone come w me to get my oil changed and to the outlets
2380 2018-12-05 20:21:53 Sierra oil & gas por lo pronto, ya se bajó del barco.
2381 2018-12-05 20:21:50 Gahaha iya supaya cepet dewasa si peler...di instagram ada sih bro yg udah bentuk oil,tp entah kasiatnya...ngeri juga gw mau yg asli langsung dari daunya, harus kuat nahan panas katanya...takut angus peler gw
2382 2018-12-05 20:21:40 When @Atiku promised job some people think it's going be in an Oil industries or CBN. 
now we know it's the same Agriculture that @Buhari is working on, small and medium scale enterprises that @osinbajo is already working on.
2383 2018-12-05 20:21:33 Neither is the oil industry
2384 2018-12-05 20:21:25 Nasooii
2385 2018-12-05 20:21:25 We can do it! But if for some reason we find out we can’t, I’m sure there’s an oil for that.
2386 2018-12-05 20:21:21 With love from Michigan. 
2387 2018-12-05 20:21:20 So we’re about 10 months fro the election and Scheer’s platform seems to be:
- anti refugee
- anti-climate
- anti-Int’l commitment
- anti-women
- anti-gay
- pro gun
- pro oil 
- pro longer prison terms
- no economic plan
- no real plan to build a pipeline
OK Then.
2388 2018-12-05 20:21:18 I don't deny it has an impact. Ive seen what 10,000 of oil can do to an ocean. I do not agree that many,of the "dire" predictions will come true. 
5.7 x 10-9 CO2 thays what we r talking about. That is 5.7 x 10-7 % 0.00000057 % . there Will always be,MM CO2.

2394 2018-12-05 20:20:44 If corn oil is made from corm & vegetable oil is made from vegetables what’s baby oil made out of? 
2395 2018-12-05 20:20:42 I disagree with your take on Marijuana on the show today.  Just because I don't think it's fair.  Cannabis can be Marijuana or Hemp ...perhaps the dispensaries are offering CBD oil to these people not THC full marijuana. I think it was one-sided.@TravisStorkMD
2396 2018-12-05 20:20:39 Most #OPEC soundbites: There will be an #oil production quota cut, we don't know level of cut yet, we don't know who will cut what yet, we don't know if some will agree to cut yet. It's all pretty cut up for tomorrow! #OOTT #oilandgas

2402 2018-12-05 20:20:10 Oil not really moving right now, probably because all of the crude traders are at the bar slamming down bevvies in anticipation of @QTRResearch's podcast this evening

Climate change requires bold action. Is Beto going to step on oil industry toes? Is he going to stay strong when they scream that the sky is falling? We don't know.
2410 2018-12-05 20:19:35 These images have been proved to be fabricated by the #econuts.
The truth is that #FossilFuels are organic and very good for the #Earth. More oil spills naturally than by man, and the biosphere is doing fantastic. Increased #CO2 concentrations have been a boon for the Earth.

2416 2018-12-05 20:18:55 Our oil, gas and coal supply is about 5000 years.  Can you imagine the technological progress by then?  Not only fusion, but the next step: TCME - Total conversion of matter to energy.  Any matter.  Unlimited energy.  The future is beyond our present imagination.
2417 2018-12-05 20:18:44 a fresh jar of coconut oil is a real feelin deh
2418 2018-12-05 20:18:42 lol, no man it's environmental concerns. Its not a targeted attack on Alberta oil.

It's only doing the bare minimum to bring up environmental problems with cargo shipping at that
2419 2018-12-05 20:18:40 Let's hope this is something Dems will actually promote. I'm dubious, though. When HRC was running, the Dem platform committee gave an OIL INDUSTRY LOBBYIST veto power over the environmental platform. Also Obama & HRC were big fracking proponents, taking big $ from fossil corps,
2420 2018-12-05 20:18:40 fuck your free oil change if I gotta wait two hours lmao
2421 2018-12-05 20:18:37 All that cooking oil was playing havoc with his waistline! It was costing him a fortune letting his jumpsuits out!  He just restocks the salad shelves now.

2423 2018-12-05 20:18:30 And lamb, o'course.

Drizzled in oil.

But not too much.
They might wriggle free and escape.
2424 2018-12-05 20:18:25 I lightly coated it with olive oil and then seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper
2425 2018-12-05 20:18:13 back in the day you could finesse the system and get yourself an oil painted self portrait for free by committing a crime and they have to legally paint your mugshot
2426 2018-12-05 20:18:08 Decided to get up with the times and get long johns with that cool-tek feature to keep me warm without sweating. Stepped out in the wind and feels like I rubbed myself in peppermint oil. Off to Tractor Supply for ugly baggy WARM thermals.

2431 2018-12-05 20:17:42 So you can’t dictate the oil prices?
2432 2018-12-05 20:17:40 GHWB was a relic. Bush family's in the oil business.  GWB Jr’s VP Cheney (Halliburton) have ties to business in Middle East...
2433 2018-12-05 20:17:36 C'est un peu exagéré , quelques centimes sur le Gas Oil particulièrement. Mais d'un autre coté, il y a des baisses de charges, la taxe habitation prise en charge à 33 % cette année, 66% l'année prochaine . Et puis, si le chômage diminue, le pouvoir d'achat sera relancé.
2434 2018-12-05 20:17:30 One hour into waiting for my oil change 
2435 2018-12-05 20:17:18 Bcuz enslaving people by shaming them for enjoying their only known life to exist is the essence of religion. Convince them that some invisible sky fairy is obsessed w/their genitalia and they're mentally ensnared.
The only thing more valuable bcuz it's virgin is olive oil.
2436 2018-12-05 20:17:17 Britain is shit always looking to destroy this fuels the conspiracy that @mdczimbabwe is advocating for sanctions and those old men in ZanuPF would believe anything even that there is oil in Zimbabwe what more this conspiracy with such evidence 
2437 2018-12-05 20:17:12 Not quite 100% right. Lines freeze, equipment explodes, gas mains rupture. And as Mr. @TheFrackingGuy, you should know that when oil prices crash, it doesn’t pay to pump from some oil/gas wells. But the wind is always blowing somewhere.
2438 2018-12-05 20:17:09 no offense but if you believe in climate change & worry for the environment but !!!consistently!!! vote Republican (or anyone who heavily accepts oil PAC money i.e. Manchin) you're an unprincipled spineless coward.

and also full offense, fuck you, the planet is dying.
2439 2018-12-05 20:17:04 Kat you gotta Get a good leave in conditioner then seal it with oil. Can’t do oil by itself it’s pointless
2440 2018-12-05 20:16:58 The biggest thing you’re gonna need is a heat gun otherwise it will be bubble central but I also recommend popsicle sticks, cups, gloves & BABY OIL!! If you get it on your hands it’s really hard to get off.
2441 2018-12-05 20:16:56 The world needs to do away with oil entirely in favour of renewable energies
2442 2018-12-05 20:16:50 You are so stupid. We do not need anything from the Saudis including oil. We have more oil than them, and can control our own internal prices. Saudis are still financing terrorists. And the Crown Prince is a BUTCHER. SANCTIONS, BREAK ALL TIES, CANCEL ALL ARMS DEALS.

2445 2018-12-05 20:16:38 Blown away by @dzarrilli and #OneNYC. Did you know #NewYork is divesting from fossil fuels, taking on big oil, going zero waste by 2030?  Cities can lead the way!
2446 2018-12-05 20:16:37 EXACTLY, another one of those standards that has been changed to suppress our oil industry.

2450 2018-12-05 20:16:12 Shame on you again, lying about who is responsible for the lower gas prices.  saudi arabia has very little.  We get like 9% of our oil from them.   You are taking credit from the sources that really do deserve the credit.
2451 2018-12-05 20:16:02 1/ At least Obama didn't have oil business ties with the Saudi's, including Osama Bin Laden, (Like Arbusto Energy in TX later taken over by Harken via money laundered by BCCI - a movement of weapons & $ to the Mujahideen (funneled to Bin Laden).+ the Carlyle Grp (same Saudis).

2455 2018-12-05 20:15:51 With Qatar leaving OPEC, there may be other Asia Pac countries currently in OPEC who will consider doing the same. In turn, the OPEC Oil cartel can be disbanded & Oil price competition can start to bring prices down longer term.

2458 2018-12-05 20:15:36 How did "humans will always need to use oil!" become a right wing, pro-oil, talking point or supposed argument ender?
It's a non-renewable resource, the less you waste it, the better off we are in the long run.
When you point out that we need it, you're agreeing to conserving it.
2459 2018-12-05 20:15:32 Made my first ever pesto. Cavalo nero, pecorino, lemon, a fuckload of garlic, rapeseed oil, no nuts. Slapped over tagliatelle with broccoli, green beans and grilled chicken. That should help sort out this impending cold!
2460 2018-12-05 20:15:21 There are now multiple hymn book threads but I just want to point out that the three best school hymns are Lord Of The Dance Settee, Give Me Oil In My Lamb Pie, and Sing Hosanna To The King (OF KINGS!).

2463 2018-12-05 20:15:05 lmao don’t feel bad i got my oil changed a couple months ago and they were like yeah uh there was like no oil in your car i was like hehe yeah
2464 2018-12-05 20:15:00 This could have something (or everything) to do with the drop in oil prices.
2465 2018-12-05 20:14:56 Please explain to me what "subjective value" means. When I mine a gram of gold, grow a crop of corn, extract a barrel of oil, produce a chip, build a house, or engage in any other action within the economy, am I inputting subjective or objective units of energy/labor/time ?
2466 2018-12-05 20:14:54 All u.s will do is to blackmail ksa by buying cheaper oil and sell more weapons to them. An optimistic always look for opportunities..na
2467 2018-12-05 20:14:34 @realDonaldTrump sells this manure that oil is why he is accessory after the fact to the #KhashoggiMurder.

FACTS:
Saudi Arabia is NOT OPEC
9% of our oil imported from SA
We don’t condone murder, even for profit.
Manure sells only in your rallies.  Demand & supply.

2468 2018-12-05 20:14:33 You didn't read the White Paper then I trust or maybe have forgotten. To remind you, that came up with £600m pa savings over GERS. GERS recognises all the oil money as you put it. So around £10bn pa fiscal transfer still to find. Not simple.

2475 2018-12-05 20:14:14 No, more like "thank you @FoxNews", where they regularly have on oil industry spokesmen to give us their "opinion" on climate change, as if that's as valid as the findings of science.

2483 2018-12-05 20:13:47 The world needs to lower its' dependence on oil!  Encourage renewable sources.
2484 2018-12-05 20:13:38 What I meant by lack of demand is that there's been a change in oil standards in ocean cargo ships, which pretty much excludes tar sands oil from use. Probably can be fixed during refinement, but that lowers the price AB sells for

2502 2018-12-05 20:12:12 Still trying to set a narrative of “rising fuel costs”. Fuel costs have dropped. Oil is at $50 a barrel. These people are protesting Carbon Tax. It’s amazing that our President had the foresight to pull out of the Paris Accord when he did.
2503 2018-12-05 20:12:11 I 100% agree energy independence is good. Ethically I agree with renewables but real solutions must be practical. Good luck getting any legislation by the lobbyists and the people in the senate on big oil pay roll

2508 2018-12-05 20:11:56 I just want to point out that the eulogies saying George HW Bush was a lion are referring to a spy master that traded state secrets for oil scams and he never called out his son as a fraud.  Thank you, good night Cleveland.
2509 2018-12-05 20:11:50 West African food hey... can't get past the smell and taste of palm oil in most of it.
2510 2018-12-05 20:11:40 The 9% of oil that we get from them won't break us if we do not get it. You make out like they have America over the barrel, we don't NEED their oil. Just because you are compromised, you are the only one who is over a barrel. Stop the lies.
2511 2018-12-05 20:11:33 I just found this Blue tooth speaker thats also a oil diffuser?!? AND IT WORKS?!?? WHAT?!?? This is so cool!
2512 2018-12-05 20:11:25 Trump inherited a vibrant economy & is running it into the ground with attacks on what should be an independent & laissez-faire economy,  interfering in affairs of individual companies, tanking industries starting in agro & oil with trade wars better resolved by negotiation.
2513 2018-12-05 20:11:17 But you want high oil prices. Your rich croney friends rely on high prices. Why would you say that. OPEC needs to cut production so American oil producers can compete.
2514 2018-12-05 20:11:07 @Ozkok_ @Brasco_Aad French gvt has cancelled the increase of taxes on oil consumption.

2517 2018-12-05 20:11:02 I would rather pay higher prices for oil so we can invest in renewable energy. So my children, and grandchildren, and their children's children have an inhabitable plant.  I want to leave them a better environment, air, and water so they can live.
2518 2018-12-05 20:10:56 You don't understand the market at all, do you? The last time we had low oil, the economy stalled, and the markets were flat or down. Only when oil went back above 70 did we go on a mad tear in the markets. All the analysts, including Kudlow, said the market needed higher oil.

2521 2018-12-05 20:10:37 Not good for marine life but:
“How Much Oil is Needed for Plastics?” Only 4% of global oil production is used for plastics. 87% is used for transport, energy and heating and simply burnt and lost. Plastics is the most sustainable use of oil since it “borrows” fossil hydrocarbons.
2522 2018-12-05 20:10:19 So my bratty dog reached the bottle of olive oil off the kitchen counter and chewed the lid off, and poured it all over himself and his dog bed. The bed is ruined, BUT his fur is super soft now, so... upside?

2539 2018-12-05 20:08:56 "The Qatari move could indicate, however, that cracks are growing within OPEC amid Saudi Arabia’s decision to forge both increased geopolitical and energy relations with Russia...and bow to U.S. pressure to ramp up oil production"
2540 2018-12-05 20:08:56 Perhaps I don't understand your proportion question. Whales need liquidity to take meaningful risk, small fish don't. Whales can use panic cascades for this liquidity, small fish don't need to. Buying a commodity that doesn't have intrinsic value isn't the same as buying oil.

2550 2018-12-05 20:08:28 Hopefully doesnt taste like burnt engine oil!
2551 2018-12-05 20:08:27 If we promoted more green energy along the way, we wouldn’t be concerned about what OPEC does now. But the GOP is owned by big oil.
2552 2018-12-05 20:08:26 We eat things fried in oil to commemorate a miracle that occurred when oil burned for eight nights!
2553 2018-12-05 20:08:08 We'd have to stop subsidizing oil companies 1st, and the free market doesn't account for the negative externalities resulting from oil.
2554 2018-12-05 20:08:06 What they need is an inveterate racist who isn't beholden to the oil lobby. Seriously, that can't be hard to find.

2558 2018-12-05 20:07:43 depending on type of pain ex arthritic fresh ginger extract works very well to control pain and inflammation. Of course there is thc oil that works for pain as well.
2559 2018-12-05 20:07:39 In fact, there is a national defense reason for curtailing oil use. Keep our reserves in the ground and let cars use green alternatives. When everyone else is out of oil, we still have our reserves to fuel the military.
2560 2018-12-05 20:07:36 Funny never trumpers seem to like Bush 41 soooo much but don’t even consider that if trump was president we’d have Iraq’s oil! No need for tax raises then. Boom

2571 2018-12-05 20:06:33 Didn't you say that you were responsible for the lower oil prices? Bring the price down again, then, if you have that power
What a total buffoon! I'd bet that you have no idea about half of the things you see and are just making things up as you buffoon along. Jerk, get some help

2573 2018-12-05 20:06:12 Thank good you are there to ensure we stay dependent on oil, foreign or domestic, instead of investing in renewable energy to free us from OPEC.  Loser!
2574 2018-12-05 20:06:04  girl for real. This shit look nasty. Maybe with some olive oil and garlic. Idk lol.
2575 2018-12-05 20:06:03 100% wash out for me. this morning i did it and just added argan oil to my hair afterwards. shit is juicy

2577 2018-12-05 20:05:57 Wtf, did a 17 story missle just crash land right next to a port used by oil tankers and cruise ships @NASA @JimBridenstine - someone needs to answer to this ASAP
2578 2018-12-05 20:05:50 Oil?
2579 2018-12-05 20:05:47 Maybe you should be thinking about what happens when the oil runs out? Climate change or not it just makes sense.
2580 2018-12-05 20:05:42 What's up with giving her breath mints at every event?
2581 2018-12-05 20:05:12 Why not just start using our own oil?
2582 2018-12-05 20:05:12 I found it near the oil field. Also it either drops a golden wedding ring after killing or there's one lying beside it. Bizarre encounter :D

2595 2018-12-05 20:03:39 In my American Studies class, I remember discussing the race to space. Imagine an engine...using say, a processor, that works off nano-technology. America no longer needs oil and our technology is in worldwide demand!
2596 2018-12-05 20:03:36 President of Calgary based Oil & Gas firm said we’re postponing our CAPEX spend next year given the nonsense of the last few weeks in the province. Not the only firm...
2597 2018-12-05 20:03:30 How can you speak for the world? Higher oil price means less oil usage and hence less pollution, surely something that is actually beneficial for the world!

2600 2018-12-05 20:03:19 This is speculation the oil industry has nothing to gain from creating a multi billion dollar environmental impact we live on the same earth as everyone else.
2601 2018-12-05 20:03:14 That was: mechanicum standard grey base, nuln oil, drybrush fenrisian grey, 50/50 nuln oil and blue glaze, drybrush fenrisian grey 
2602 2018-12-05 20:03:11 Crikey Helen, I empathise. Oil tanks are fiercely expensive to replace Hx
2603 2018-12-05 20:02:58 You're awfully antagonistic toward oil workers. Been spurned in a past life? I'm guessing you were a tarsand beetle and got crushed by a mine worker, and now you're all bitter....
2604 2018-12-05 20:02:55 Tell your mom that we'll hook you guys up with a  new car, lifetime warranty, and a year of free oil changes!
2605 2018-12-05 20:02:31 If only it was an oil painting…
2606 2018-12-05 20:02:27 oil is old tech, move on FFS
2607 2018-12-05 20:02:24 You should take a ride on a plane, invite Justin and his ministers, with just enough fuel to takeoff (climate change) when the plane drops, you'll understand how we feel with the oil stocks dropping, good luck
2608 2018-12-05 20:02:18 Oil is safe but not affordable  I blame the politicians for that BTU value of oil better than gas
2609 2018-12-05 20:02:06 Please answer why your govt did not appeal a lower court decision on TMX? Why do you support bill c-69 ? Why more carbon taxes when social license has accomplished nothing? Why do you allow foreign funding of anti Cdn oil industry groups? #cdnpoli#abpoli
2610 2018-12-05 20:02:01 Let us hook you up sis! We'll get you in a new car and a year of free oil changes!
2611 2018-12-05 20:01:59 I saw this in Aruba.  Valero ran an oil refinery there, profitably, without endangering a nearby reef of endangered fish.  Let that sink in.  Pollution is *pure* unqualifiable greed.
2612 2018-12-05 20:01:42 lol I tell people I need “super” gas or “super” oil lmfao dumb as hell
2613 2018-12-05 20:01:42 The “catastrophic risks” have been greatly exaggerated by oil industrialists that spread fear, uncertainty and doubt to preserve their cash flow.
2614 2018-12-05 20:01:39 You've given a class B drug to a 2 week old child on the basis of a 2600 year old recipe for, at best, an anointing oil, based on "something something illuminati Satanist vaccines are poison" bullshit?
You might sleep better, but then, cannabis will do that.

2619 2018-12-05 20:00:53 between this and the "coconut oil is liquid cancer and can kill you with a mere look, Medusa-style" story I get feeling this is now part of some broader social media research/strategy on their part

2628 2018-12-05 20:00:01 Its money from special interest groups in the US that fund anti- oilsands campaigns to keep our oil from tidewater, this will guarantee cheap oil in the future. People like the koch brothers.
2629 2018-12-05 20:00:00 Grape seed oil has my scalp feeling amazing 
2630 2018-12-05 19:59:59 If you buy oil for example at a dollar price per barrel and the exchange £/$ increases due to the conversion it means you require more £ to buy the barrel. Easy. He thinks if the pound is worth less then you can go into poundland and only effectively pay 87p. Mug 'em right off.

2632 2018-12-05 19:59:40 They put the same soil back where it came from and replace the native vegetation. The oil industry has set aside  more land for nature than any other industry in America.

2636 2018-12-05 19:59:22 Pls who sells carrot oil?
2637 2018-12-05 19:59:18 Raise oil prices.  End energy subsidies now.
2638 2018-12-05 19:59:15 Maybe when you sacrifice another journalist as a trade off for cheaper oil then OPEC will listen you punk
2639 2018-12-05 19:59:12 สวยจังง่ะ
2640 2018-12-05 19:59:00 But a bunch of people have told me that only 1-2% of Beto's donations came from oil, so it should actually be pretty easy in this specific case.
2641 2018-12-05 19:58:55 Think about the very poor people of Russia, the low prices for oil and we all immediately go up in price, the rich do not care, and those who live and work here are immediately higher
2642 2018-12-05 19:58:47 "The six-country #OPEC/non-OPEC monitoring committee is recommending a six-month production cut of "at least 1 million b/d" using a baseline of either September or October production levels, Omani #oil minister Mohammed al-Rumhy said Wednesday" source @SPGlobalPlatts #OOTT #BRENT
2643 2018-12-05 19:58:46 Don’t we get more oil from Canada than OPEC? Oil should never be a reason to overlook bad things done by other countries.
2644 2018-12-05 19:58:32 Until coal and oil money convinces voters of the hardships to be experienced with a carbon tax.
2645 2018-12-05 19:58:30 A big part of our economy is oil. We need to keep oil moderately priced for the economy to keep growing. Super low oil is **not** good for anyone @POTUS
2646 2018-12-05 19:58:30 Funny how that doesn’t seem to matter for the Saudi oil, being imported into the East..  
2647 2018-12-05 19:58:27 I'm currently sitting in a car dealership, waiting for my oil to be changed, while simultaneously crying and writing a reflection paper on my personal experience with sexual identity development theory.

Prepare the entity for sale. It is outdated, old and we don’t have the resources. Put the shares on the stock market. GOJ keep 20%
2655 2018-12-05 19:57:52 You are getting us all extinct!!! 
1) The average american has one of the highest carbon footprint of the planet (20 tons of CO2 per person per year). 
2) Oil is "cheap" because the fucking atmosphere and the future generations are paying the price of your stupidity.
2656 2018-12-05 19:57:49 Watching the liberal fake news media fawn over GW Bush, it’s almost like they didn’t spend 8 years comparing him to Hitler, accusing him of bigotry, blowing up the levies in New Orleans, lying the country into war for oil, behind 9/11.

2659 2018-12-05 19:57:41 Just met up with the oil man, I been running low 
2660 2018-12-05 19:57:27 Good point. However, we r not dependent on Saudi oil. This is another attempt by Trump 2 justify not condemning Saudi prince. Also, there is no 450 billion dea. The only reason not to condem Saudi prince is based on Trump & Kushner's real estate profits now & in the future.
2661 2018-12-05 19:57:22 Coconut oil why! Smells horrible
2662 2018-12-05 19:57:18 Olive oil is just not for me 
2663 2018-12-05 19:57:10 Yes it is because of the loss of oil platforms...
2664 2018-12-05 19:56:58 She co sponsored a copper sulfide mining bill for Polymet, in the Superior National Forest. This would endanger the water supply from Lake Superior. I don't think she gets how important drinkable water is to our world.Polymet gave us the BP oil spill if you recall.
2665 2018-12-05 19:56:52 Let me put it like this.... How much lead is there in this country to be able to provide enough electric cars for everyone that owns a car to have one?? EPA has all our SMELTERS SHUT DOWN except for a couple because of pollution.. I guess it's like oil see no speak no ASSWIPE

2667 2018-12-05 19:56:38 oh man same, i’ve been putting coconut oil on before i put on deodorant and then spraying rose water on afterwards and it’s definitely lessened the itching a bit lmao
2668 2018-12-05 19:56:27 The got what they voted for - snake oil.
2669 2018-12-05 19:56:19 When there’s no other option, because much safer pipelines aren’t being built... I actually haul clean oil to one of the railroad terminals, where it’s put on cars. Lots already moving on cars, and I guess there’s going to be more going that way...
2670 2018-12-05 19:56:18 Jamaican black castor oil really works wonders
2671 2018-12-05 19:56:16 everyone always talks about Revolver and others as their "best" - nothing tops the White Album for me either. And - 1970's bonus, lining it with tin foil while baking in the sun with baby oil while listening to it wafting out the window from the stereo? Visceral memory.
2672 2018-12-05 19:56:07 I'm all for getting money out of politics, but until that magical day arrives it's a reality that in order to be competitive pols need cash and if you're running in a state whose industry is oil that's where your cash will come from.
2673 2018-12-05 19:56:06 No golden whiskers? #sad
2674 2018-12-05 19:56:02 You're funny. I'm many generations deep in the oil field in mcmurray. They'd have to eliminate 75% of their work force. They'll never do it. Plus, they'd lose in court.
2675 2018-12-05 19:55:59 My younger sis was memorizing biology and she was talking about reproduction, the way she was saying it, like I should slap her
2676 2018-12-05 19:55:53 I’ll just change my own fkn oil
2677 2018-12-05 19:55:50 If it dropped in demand why would the Alberta Government spend billions on rail cars to get another 250,000 barrel's per day to America. The US is buying our oil for $20 and selling theirs for $50+ and we are losing billions that could help pay for social programs in Eastern CAN
2678 2018-12-05 19:55:48 Very few liberals ever lead by example. We derive more than 6,000 byproducts from oil: tar for roofs, asphalt for roads, fertilizer &| insecticides,the plastics for our computers, tvs & phones, aspirin, detergents, vinyl gloves & assorted hospital supplies, antihistamines...
2679 2018-12-05 19:55:41 Arnold's converted his Hummer to run on vegetable oil. His passenger would get hungry because the exhaust smelled like french fries.
2680 2018-12-05 19:55:32 It all because of oil & previous wars that the fascist profit off of!!
2681 2018-12-05 19:55:29 Oh boy, if only thermodynamic science could find a way to burn bullshit.. oil would be old news!!
2682 2018-12-05 19:55:21 Good oil change

"Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!"
2686 2018-12-05 19:54:45 It isn’t the Feds buying Saudi oil, its North American oil companies. You can google that if you like.
2687 2018-12-05 19:54:44 Lay off. You already accomplished you mission. Lower oil@from here will not help the U.S.
2688 2018-12-05 19:54:44 Also mice hate the smell of peppermint. When we had mice I’d get some peppermint oil and soak cotton balls and place them near where they were moving around in the walks. They’d scurry to get tf away from there.
2689 2018-12-05 19:54:42 Those lawyers are individuals who represent a tiny portion of Beto’s donations. They are probably democrats who supported Beto’s stand on many issues. If oil company workers are such a monolithic voting block, explain to me how Houston, where so many work, is so blue/progressive?
2690 2018-12-05 19:54:39 Meanwhile you and your masters in Tel Aviv are threatening Iran's Oil Fields, attempting to blackmail Iran and bomb their working nuclear reactors. Iran has every International legal right to close entry, exits to the Persian Gulf if their Nation and Oil Tankers are attacked.
2691 2018-12-05 19:54:35 That's...that's not how oil prices work.  

You have to have someone open the door because you don't know the function of knobs, do you?
2692 2018-12-05 19:54:30 Again, taking campaign contributions from big oil companies is not the same as spending campaign funds on travel...no candidates should be taking money from any industry... elections should be publicly funded and we should end Citizens United
2693 2018-12-05 19:54:26 The infrastructure for that is too costly but also big oil has a powerful lobby and legislation favoring it as well as oil being central to many foreign ties. As much as I dislike the situation, going fully renewable isn't practical
2694 2018-12-05 19:54:17 How about you get some helpful ideas in fixing the trade agreement with China instrad of worrying about oil prices?  Right now gasoline prices are quite plateable, now let's save the ecconomy and jobs starting with Wall street and China trade.
2695 2018-12-05 19:54:16 Shitcunting palm oil has not only ruined nutella for me but now also Heroes!!! They taste like arse. Stop using this foul shite in all my chawclat pleeeeease! 
2696 2018-12-05 19:53:56 Sadly not but, approximately: trim halve + roast in a drizzle of oil. Mix tbsp each soy + LJ, grate in a clove garlic. Toss roasted sprouts in when done. Sometimes needs a pinch brown sugar. Can add chilli flakes.
2697 2018-12-05 19:53:49 i came from manitoba so wasn't a fan of oil OR 99 so i'm not sure, Only been oil fan 8-9 years..

2699 2018-12-05 19:53:48 1He was advised to invade Iraq most likely - due to the fact that Sadaam was trading oil for euro which affected the US dollar .

2700 2018-12-05 19:53:47 You’d think but what the hell !! Hey Ari. Sit down and shut up your Embarrassing!!
2701 2018-12-05 19:53:44 Walk away from whoever it is... I got rid of a pending stroke by consuming the poison Coconut Oil.. Saturated Fat.. 4 years on, I’m still consuming it, grass fed meat, 6 free range eggs a day, avocado, Nitrate/Nitrite free bacons, pure butter, CPVOO..
2702 2018-12-05 19:53:43 All right. Figgy pudding beard oil is a go. I don’t have the formula yet, but, fig, clove, vanilla, ginger do the heavy lifting with orange and almond as accents.
2703 2018-12-05 19:53:35 Yeah that stuff is good. Before I used some kind of oil or balm, taking my makeup off was misery lol
2704 2018-12-05 19:53:32 @MelissaLeeCNBC  bought oil low is it gonna go higher soon?
2705 2018-12-05 19:53:31 So defenders injured is not a reason now. Wow ok. To play good football you need a solid base at the back. If you are still in doubt ask Pep Guardiola, his employers spent barrels of oil to assemble the most expensive defence ever assembled.
2706 2018-12-05 19:53:30 This video was recordered without autorization of community action board and enviromental leader, this region is full of oil and gas blocks wich licences were granted in Amazonas ( last year more than 230.000 hect burned) and in dates of Plan Colombia before peace agreement! SOS
2707 2018-12-05 19:53:11 Nah, they dropped the palm oil after the public backlash but never really recovered
2708 2018-12-05 19:53:06 Even more by staying? Nah. Since Qatar main income isn't coming from oil, they'll be producing like crazy as they don't have to follow the quota anymore. Meaning they can dump and watch the oil price drop, which will only hurt oil depending countries... Like Saudi.
2709 2018-12-05 19:53:01 Missing from the "By the time you're 30, you should have" memes: a jar of something (dip, tapenade, infused oil, relish, etc.) that flavors everything you cook for weeks at a time and frees up valuable real estate in the refrigerator you share with your roommates' rotting produce
2710 2018-12-05 19:53:00 Now available: @walkaboutbrewin Midnight oil, @archrockbrewing Adipose!
2711 2018-12-05 19:52:55 Bernie surrogates attacking Beto for accepting money from people who worked in oil and gas. That's what I'm talking about.
2712 2018-12-05 19:52:40 My analysis is $4/gram profit. Which is 900 mil (next year!) that by the way is dry herb, not oil or concentrate which have higher margins. Cut 4$/profit in half - still netting +400 mil in 2019. Canada  operations only! Selling to EU  . I wish I had dry powder on hand.
2713 2018-12-05 19:52:39 The sad truth is Albertans dug this hole they are in. Over decades they drilled for oil, saved little of the revenues, and failed to invest in the future. Canadians are sympathetic but we're not inclined to step any more ($5.4bill) until Albertans begin to diversify their economy
2714 2018-12-05 19:52:39 定番ですね〜
2715 2018-12-05 19:52:37 You obviously know nothing regarding who sets the price for a barrel of oil!  Keep showcasing your ignorance. It’s most amusing!  
2716 2018-12-05 19:52:33 But, blood for oil war-Iraq; racist Willie Horton ad, against the Civil Rights Act; countless Aids deaths due to his indifference; he appointed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court; refused to apologize for a missile that killed 290 innocent civilians aboard an Iranian aircraft.
2717 2018-12-05 19:52:31 I think I am gonna move forward with my plans for making essential oil aroma diffusers for fursuit storage/etc. Pumice stone pendants and such as well as cedar or pine slices with woodburned names or pawprints on them.
2718 2018-12-05 19:52:30 True. I think I use the Olive Oil one
2719 2018-12-05 19:52:13 @EmmanuelMacron For the UN and you to get rid of fossil fuels, you will have to have technology ready to make everyone's car run without gas or oil, soon as that is done mission accomplished.  You have not learned that to burden the poorest with your ideas is a populists dream.
2720 2018-12-05 19:51:55 Minister @CarmantLionel says pot consumption will be restricted to people in private at home. If landlords say no smoking he suggests edibles and oil.

2722 2018-12-05 19:51:45 She lost me at CAP. They are an anti-progressive think tank which takes funding from Oil Rich UAE in exchange for political favors. CAP does not work for what is best for Americans. They are in it for the money and political power.
2723 2018-12-05 19:51:36 This is the treatment I also get. I’ve been eyeing CBD oil for a while now but it’s so expensive idk if it’s worth the risk of it not doing anything.
2724 2018-12-05 19:51:33 That's what happened to Cadbury and now its products are full of palm oil grown on the corpses of orangutans, or something like that.
2725 2018-12-05 19:51:32 THATS SO COOL THOUGH DUDE I LOVE THE COLORS IT MAKES IT SUPER FUCKIN FUN also whenever you don't like an oil painting just call it impressionist or abstract and everyone will call u a genius s2g! it's a genre babey!

2728 2018-12-05 19:51:16 Bret is the one with a ego so big he won’t even debate molyneux, so I’m just not sure about what you’re saying about molyneux’s ego? And you claiming that he is a “snake oil” or whatever isn’t an argument. Lol. Once again I love both and think both are very smart, not bias.
2729 2018-12-05 19:51:07 who wants to pick up my car and take it for an oil change and detailed? 
2730 2018-12-05 19:51:05 Egg Foo Yung. It's not fried like an omelette, it's fried in deeper oil. It's really the egg patty of the sandwich they call a St. Paul" which isn't from or in St. Paul, it's from St Louis (with brown gravy).

2732 2018-12-05 19:50:54 Well, TBF, Obama didn't get the price of oil down by letting the Saudis murder U.S. Residents, so, there's that.
2733 2018-12-05 19:50:45 Alternatives to oil would be a better idea. Hydro, Solar.....
2734 2018-12-05 19:50:45 I have questions for anyone with an air fryer. I just bought one last week & I need help. Should I put a little bit of oil in the bottom? I made fries & they are a little dry.
2735 2018-12-05 19:50:43 Hahaha, never hurt anybody. Chip pans - Sure my mum used the same oil for 20 years.
2736 2018-12-05 19:50:43 To summarize “we are so blessed to have oil money”
2737 2018-12-05 19:50:39 massively recommend. If you use hot paprika and a bit of olive oil*, these become the British version of patatas bravas. I wouldn't dare say better than, but very close
*needs a smoke extractor
2738 2018-12-05 19:50:37 Mfoe can you please tell us what is Zimbabwe  manufacturing at the moment? You are busy buying expensive raw materials in Zambia  yet we can be growing our own here? Your cooking oil is always going to be expensive as compared to SA cooking oil.
2739 2018-12-05 19:50:36 Life without my parents would be so hard I don’t even wanna imagine it. Like who gonna cut my mangoes for me the way I like, make me ashak when I want or do my oil changes, buy me a new car sterio base or new tires? Uggh no.
2740 2018-12-05 19:50:26 Hot bath with jojoba oil
2741 2018-12-05 19:50:18 Shows how much you DON’T know about the industry. The price of oil is determined by the world market. Not any one individual or country.
2742 2018-12-05 19:50:13 Most do not understand how much they pay for oil burning cars, with gas and maintenance it can add up so much that if you can save this cost and apply it towards a more costly EV it ends up being cash neutral. The externalized cost not included such as green house gas emissions..
2743 2018-12-05 19:50:11 Blood for oil war-Iraq, racist Willie Horton ad, against the Civil Rights Act, Bush 43, countless Aids deaths due to his indifference, he was Reagan's VP, he appointed Clarence Thomas, refused to apologize for missile killed 290 innocent civilians aboard an Iranian aircraft.
2744 2018-12-05 19:50:10 Vinaigrette or olive oil?
2745 2018-12-05 19:50:06 Head Office applied castor oil to my beard. Kukude kwaBeauty
2746 2018-12-05 19:49:57 1.Yeah man, let Petrojam corruption shit bleed right out in public and let's be clear...this has been happening under both the JLP AND PNP governments. 
I know certain members of the private sector are shitting their draws right now..$5bn dollar worth of oil missing since 2013?
2747 2018-12-05 19:49:44 Palm oil is one of the worst oils for health/ingesting. 
It is not an EFA-Essential Fatty Acid like olive oil, coconut oil, or Flax oil that are good for you arteries. 
Palm oil is also harder to digest than EFA's. 
External use is OK, but there are even better oils for that.
2748 2018-12-05 19:49:41 Not as bad as the oil industry money, for example several nursing unions gave lots of money to Bernie and that's what builds up that healthcare industry total. 

Show me insurance company or for-profit hospital execs maxing out to Bernie like how oil execs maxed for Beto
2749 2018-12-05 19:49:36 Just make sure they are pure. Mine is strictly cbd and coconut oil. I can drop it or rub it on my skin also I can add it to Shea butter and rub it all over.
2750 2018-12-05 19:49:27 It was great joining @CoreFinanceTV team ahead of #OPEC to discuss oil price direction. #Brent, #WTI braced for more volatility & Q1 2019 likely to see more market kerfuffle regardless of what happens in Vienna. Thanks for having me on the show @nickbatsford #OOTT #oilandgas
2751 2018-12-05 19:49:25 Celebrate the royal dynasty of oil barons peppered with war crimes, fantastic!
2752 2018-12-05 19:49:22 Omg oil oil and oil. But it’s still cracking hurting and just simply annoying! 
2753 2018-12-05 19:49:20 @VW just announced they are going to an all electric fleet by 2026! Oil is going to be obsolete. Wind, solar, renewable energy is the future & needs to be embraced more
2754 2018-12-05 19:49:18 I can’t relate to because I’m muslim but after eating mathai you know that extra oil is just another form of moisturiser  
2755 2018-12-05 19:49:14 We're not discussing CN and Air Canada. We're discussing Suncor. And CN/Air Canada are not exempt from the law. However, they may have a claus in employee contracts stipulating, and agreed to by employees, for random DT. Suncor/oil field does not.
2756 2018-12-05 19:49:14 A federal jury in Manhattan has convicted a Hong Kong businessman of bribing the presidents of Chad and Uganda to secure oil rights for a Chinese energy conglomerate.

2758 2018-12-05 19:49:10 As prosperous as America, there's no state owned oil company sir !
Are you aware that NNPC sells our crude oil, deduct fuel subsidy, operational cost & overhead costs before a paltry sum is paid to the current FG who then now share to various states? Pls think wisely b4 comment.
2759 2018-12-05 19:49:09 Get some harvesters and more of them is my suggestion.
2760 2018-12-05 19:49:08 Ok Mr. Big Shot what would you do? Do we need to drop The Big One on them. Do we send in Special Opps to end his life. Hey , how about this, stop all trade, including oil. You have no idea what’s going on.
2761 2018-12-05 19:49:08 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇

2764 2018-12-05 19:48:51 The  definitely needs higher oil prices.
2765 2018-12-05 19:48:39 Try elderberry syrup and oil of oregano. Both natural and work. Take care of you!!
2766 2018-12-05 19:48:37 It’s kind of like Harper on his book tour bloviating about the future. The same Harper who didn’t have the vision to build a single pipeline to the West Coast ensuring the long-term viability of Alberta oil. Harper's epic failure will haunt Alberta for a generation
2767 2018-12-05 19:48:34 i fucking love coconut oil it’s the best thing ever

2770 2018-12-05 19:48:27 How can we starve out these countries opposing our hegemony with valuable oil?
2771 2018-12-05 19:48:25 i smell bacon  making bacon ..i smell bacon  I SMELL BACON...MAKING BACON..THIS PAST THANKS GIVING  I BEAT A TURKEY & WEN HE WOULDN'T DIE,I INSULTED HIM ,THEN I DIPPED HIM IN FRYING OIL AFEW TIMES ,THEN I STABBED HIM 3 TIMES THEN I CHOPPED ITS HEAD OF & HE STARTED BREAKDANCING
2772 2018-12-05 19:48:24 Except for the ones that disagree with you and want jobs in the oil and gas sector.....you don’t like those ones so much do you?
2773 2018-12-05 19:48:22 Pretty well known that sour crudes have dropped in demand, and there's an obvious over production if we don't have the capacity to move it.
I agree with you in that we should be utilizing our own oil instead of bringing it in, especially for the reasons you said
2774 2018-12-05 19:48:17 There is nobody WASPier than me. I am WASPier than GHWB, DAR on four sides of the family. He sold his soul to the racist oil interests which have brought us rising seas, hurricanes, wildfires, and extreme heat events, selling out WASP conservation/civil rights values big time.
2775 2018-12-05 19:48:12 "Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted..." When a clown realize, that his big words don't work out and Saudi-Arabia is still laughing about him.
2776 2018-12-05 19:48:11 If they cut 5 million barrels it would make a difference. When every1 predicted the end of oil at $28 a barrel, those who bought oilers at that level made a killing.Shale can't replace 5million barrels. plus, a race to the bottom will affect the (heavily indebted) shale producers
2777 2018-12-05 19:48:04 The US is now the largest producer of oil in the world!  Thanks to you President Trump! 

Thank you for removing red tape & deregulating this industry; more oil produced means more men have jobs & support their families! You always put America & Americans first. God bless you!
2778 2018-12-05 19:48:01 That's what I was thinking ~ kind of like OIl Rubbed Bronze.  Will be interesting to see how matte black does. #kbtribechat
2779 2018-12-05 19:47:55 Tea tree oil is a really good spot treatment for pimples.

They own the Republican Party!Nothing happens in GOP without their approval! Putin being in Oil industry joined!
2781 2018-12-05 19:47:52 Except the world definitely needs oil. Sure, global warming exists, but this world won't survive without using oil.
2782 2018-12-05 19:47:49 Eating homemade aubergine, chickpea, mushroom & tofu curry made with coconut milk & fragrant spices; onion squash sautéed in ginger, garlic & chilli; kale & spinach cooked in olive oil, lemon & garlic - and all on a bed of the fluffiest rice. Deeeeeelicious!!!!!

2789 2018-12-05 19:47:13 It is un-American to force the nation into a dependency on foreign oil.  Renewable energy is the only way to go.
2790 2018-12-05 19:47:07 Oooo! I just ordered these capsules online and they’re 10mg and so far I like it! I wanna get the oil soon too. I’ve heard so many good things!
2791 2018-12-05 19:47:06 Uh so a cpc MP just said that the PM should celebrate the workers at oil fields instead of talking about how women are assaulted (last part clearly implied).
2792 2018-12-05 19:47:01 Yes, they never criticized him at all. What wonderful saints they all are. Smh
2793 2018-12-05 19:46:52 Venezuela situation got to the point it is right now because off all the dirty money it funnel through out the Caribbean and Latin America. It bought the support of many countries on dirty oil money.

I beg the President of USA, Donald Trump, to please..... shut up.

Yes, they will do what you want, but please take credit 6 months from now, not now, as they will be obligated to save face.

Please, learn how DC works, sir.
2800 2018-12-05 19:46:22 Checked in to get my oil changed and the guy goes you know you get your complimentary car vacuum today lmao. I mean I’ll take it 
2801 2018-12-05 19:46:21 Try oil (olive or mineral) or shaving cream and rub it into the skin. It may take a couple of tries 
2802 2018-12-05 19:46:18 Viral news is funny that way. It only takes a few influential people to start that forest fire. The pressure of low oil prices has Albertans on high alert, so the climate is ripe for it.

2808 2018-12-05 19:45:37 Why don‘t you put tariffs on oil to help the US oil industry ? Isn‘t it the same as with the steel industry?  Or are you afraid the US people will recognize more obviously that they all are paying for your tariff strategy ?
2809 2018-12-05 19:45:31 Great article! Loved the "how to" recipe and breakdown of each essential oil. 
2810 2018-12-05 19:45:24 Brent Oil auf Tiefstand- #Benzinpreis nach wie vor hoch.  Wo sind eigentlich die Stimmen der #CDU #spd #fdp #afd ??
2811 2018-12-05 19:45:24 Come into the 21st century and focus more on renewables than coal and oil already.  Stop being in the back pocket of the oil and coal companies.
2812 2018-12-05 19:45:21 Research I did a decade or so past: News read how an American Corp. contracted w/ Saudi Arabia when they discovered oil on Saudi land. The Corp. said it was worth little, then made Millions. Of course SA recognised the truth.  One more reason SA distrusts the USA. .
2813 2018-12-05 19:45:20 BoC cycle very much linked to Fed's. Oil price move will hurt energy investment in CAD as it will in US. 1.4% of 2.5% US GDP by Q3 2017 was energy investment. The reasons CAD is going down are the same reasons the dollar will do.
2814 2018-12-05 19:45:20 I’m still mad about all the Brussels sprouts I missed out on because of the disinformation campaign against them. I’ll eat them roasted with olive oil, salt and pepper until they’re gone.
2815 2018-12-05 19:45:15 I believe the average donation from oil & gas employees was $165 for Beto. Which means there were a shitload of smaller donations balancing out the bigger ones. But you know, details.

TY students recently took part in an oil painting workshop in Quay art gallery, Killaloe and produced some fantastic work.
2820 2018-12-05 19:44:31 @blackrock why are you investing in oil companies that contribute to the serious climate change problem our earth is facing? Why not invest in renewable energy to help the planet out.
2821 2018-12-05 19:44:30 USA needs to push to get oil from Canada to lower the demand on oil. Lower the demand, lower the oil prices.
2822 2018-12-05 19:44:29 Have you ever heard of climate change?  Renewable energy, wind and solar is what the world is & needs to look at. Alberta needs to refine oil before shipping it. The oil fields are not profitable now & will soon be laying off workers, create jobs in refining.
2823 2018-12-05 19:44:20 Oil dey your head

2826 2018-12-05 19:44:16 Ah ok, didn’t know you had one.

2839 2018-12-05 19:43:12 A federal jury in Manhattan has convicted a Hong Kong businessman of bribing the presidents of Chad and Uganda to secure oil rights for a Chinese energy conglomerate.
2840 2018-12-05 19:43:12 A photographic crossroads. Its elves are very young, it's built out of stucco and rattan, it could be a mall, and it smells like oil.
2841 2018-12-05 19:43:10 That might sound right in your heart, but not in reality. Oil & NatGas are the cheapest forms of energy we have, it doesn’t matter how much we invest in alternatives, that reality still exists. Furthermore, marginalizing the Mid E will stop mass migration & terrorism how exactly?
2842 2018-12-05 19:43:10 Demand for condensate, a very light oil blended with thick oil sands crude so it will flow through pipes, is expected to fall as producers cut heavy output.,

2845 2018-12-05 19:42:59 2 months ago market was afraid that there is not enough spare capacity to supply enough oil and now 1.3M b/d cuts is not enough to stop the bear sentiment. Such a fast change of story and sentiment.
2846 2018-12-05 19:42:54 In that case, we should definitely go with either Biden the child molester or Beto the oil puppet who voted in support of trump's defense spending on three separate occasions.
2847 2018-12-05 19:42:53 Hybrid / electric cars have been around for a long time. Sadly oil has its price. Fighting climate change is the biggest waste of time i have ever seen. Getting the whole world to do the right thing. Lol... ummm....no. waste of time

2851 2018-12-05 19:42:21 So in other words the price of gas and heating oil is going up...

2860 2018-12-05 19:41:12 Idiot, oil prices are high because we're RUNNING OUT OF OIL. Suply and demand. Demand his high, suply is low...basic economics here, not that you'd understand

2877 2018-12-05 19:39:55 Did you know we get most of our oil from Canada?  I didn't think so.
2878 2018-12-05 19:39:51 I agree and while you are at it you can research other countries more suited to your way of thinking and see if you can find any. You don’t have to stay here. Oil industry is not opposed to innovation. Or change. A healthy balance between industry, and environment is possible
2879 2018-12-05 19:39:50 I just came across this headline: 'Chemicals In Non-Stick Frying Pans Are Making Men's Peni#*ses Shrink'

2880 2018-12-05 19:39:48 The Korean war is not officially over, and the US still imports oil and electricity.
2881 2018-12-05 19:39:46 Suddam started going nuts saying that Iraq should not be held responsible, for the debts they owed due to the war, and threatened military use if Kuwait didn’t stop using an oil field that Iraq believed belonged to them.

Kuwait denied, Iraq invaded, and the US cut ties with Iraq

2883 2018-12-05 19:39:32 So Canada takes the lead in developing technologies and resources to develop and transport our resources in the most environmentally friendly ways we can and then we end up buying our oil from the saudis and Venezuela, because what we’ve done still isn’t good enough.

2887 2018-12-05 19:39:19 Idiot - at current rates of production, oil will run out in 53 years, natural gas in 54, and coal in 110. We have managed to deplete these fossil fuels – which have their origins somewhere between 541 and 66 million years ago – in less than 200 years since we started using them

In the end there are lots of costs associated with your “normal” car that you just accept but with an EV there’s no gas or oil and hardly any maintenance. Used EVs are more affordable than ever.

2895 2018-12-05 19:38:43 You mean like taking office despite losing the popular vote, cutting taxes for the wealthy, bombing people who never attacked us on 9/11 to enrich war profiteers and the oil industry, expanding the surveillance state, deregulating wall st, and legitimizing toxic nationalism?

2903 2018-12-05 19:38:12 More obvious sherry influences, raisins & prunes & orange oil. Quite a good spice kick though, clove and fresh red chilli.

2909 2018-12-05 19:37:51 So... Alberta makes a deal that brings them on side with zero risk BUT includes a renegotiation clause at the 5 year (or 3 year or 7 year) point. Just get a deal done! Start pumping the oil. Demonstrate it works well for all. Keep thinking outside the box!

2910 2018-12-05 19:37:51 Of course it does. It frames the intervention as based in "secur[ing] access to Balkan markets and control[ling] the routes of oil and gas pipelines."
Not a word about Serbian fascism against Bosnian Muslims.... but then again, par for the course for you genocidal Islamophobes.

2918 2018-12-05 19:37:10 With a few, VERY expensive exceptions, most modern perfumery is stomach-turning fly spray. I mourn the loss of subtlety. Estee Lauder started the rot by turning a pungent sickly bath oil into a perfume in 1953. Scent no longer seduces, it chloroforms its prey.
2919 2018-12-05 19:36:57 @realDonaldTrump Keeping oil flows as is, hopefully opec will be, not restricted. The world wants not to see, or need, higher oil prices!
2920 2018-12-05 19:36:52 They also deny climate change because they make more money from oil lobbyists than they do nature lobbyists (who don'r exist)
2921 2018-12-05 19:36:46 @HWarlow I just read your post about Dr S - is he ill - or upset about the oil delivery issue? Worried!
2922 2018-12-05 19:36:44 I assume you will stop using oil and everything that uses it right? No delivery, no taxis, no non-electric cars, nothing that uses oil  at any point, I assume.

2924 2018-12-05 19:36:41 Oil politics are central to the neoliberal order, all the way back to its origins, which in turn ties into suburbanization and white flight, Middle East conflict, even the obesity epidemic.

2926 2018-12-05 19:36:34 @CNN “Diversity in oil prices is our strength”. “The middle class is enriched by our policies” “sea levels will rise and flood Las Vegas” Trump is bad, mkay, Trump is to blame, ok!
2927 2018-12-05 19:36:33 What I'm saying here is that the data, without context, is meaningless. You're using it to conjure a conclusion in the mind of the reader. Cand X gets a lot of oil money, therefore, must be in the pocket of Big Oil. I'm saying you can't infer that from the data you've provided.
2928 2018-12-05 19:36:26 Can't access the article but I thought US emissions were dropping. Is their enhanced oil & gas production a major part of this?

2970 2018-12-05 19:32:39 Yes, the oil profiteers knew that oil was on its way out, so they got him to REPEAL the 40 yr ban on exporting oil (Dec 15), and put pipelines in place to export. And they LIE to use eminent domain, pretending this is for 'our needs', when it is for PROFITS OF THE FEW.
2971 2018-12-05 19:32:34 How does Pakistan’s oil marketing cos. will get affected in the immediate short term when crude prices are looking to rise?
2972 2018-12-05 19:32:31 Talm bout castor oil am I tweakin or that shit defly don’t go in hair
2973 2018-12-05 19:32:30 The lecture might be more palatable if it wasn't coming from a twitter snarkmaster whose been hanging out in the halls of power this week, as her husband is vaunted as the new anti-trump editor in chief.
2974 2018-12-05 19:32:27 No, increase oil prices. Get that shit out of here. Oil needs to be phased out of mainstream industry and commercial use wherever possible. Naive and "impossible" as that may be, it has to be done.

Also, resign.
2975 2018-12-05 19:32:18 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2976 2018-12-05 19:32:16 I had a headache in the middle of the night. It turned into a migraine. I took 4 drops of Magicoil's CBD Oil, and my migraine is almost gone! Every time I use our products I am amazed & thankful! God knew what he was doing when he planted the Earth!  #Magicoil #BeBest
2977 2018-12-05 19:32:15 Alaskans own 1,333 shares of GAIL INDIA LTD, worth $60,325. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in INDIA.
2978 2018-12-05 19:32:14 I don’t think it was primarily Russians orchestrating Brexit, fascism in Italy, oil protests in France, attempt at splitting Catalonia from Spain... these efforts are pan-national
2979 2018-12-05 19:32:12 What do you think of Revelation 6:6 where it says "the price of wheat will go through the roof , but the oil and the wine will remain untouched"?
2980 2018-12-05 19:32:09 Yet u support the pipeline&fracking, seismic airgun blasts to look for oil on the ocean floor, copper&cobalt mining on national lands, plus your roll backs in land&air quality  regulations...along w/all the other environmental protections YOU have undone.
2981 2018-12-05 19:32:08 Do not listen to trump. Everyone hates him. He wants to dissolve opec and make a mess while keeping USA oil the winner. Need to cut oil production to keep economic healthy!!! No one want oil plunging!
2982 2018-12-05 19:32:02 Congratulations on your self awarded degrees in climate science.  I’m currently sitting with reps from oil majors, the US airline industry, major universities, and the national laboratories reviewing investments and technologies for decarbonizing air travel.  But you do you.
2983 2018-12-05 19:31:53 Bush 43 Iraq War Blood for oil + his air missiles got troops on their way home killed; he opposed the Civil Rights Act; he was fine with the racist Willie Horton Ad; and more. He doesn't deserve to be canonized.
2984 2018-12-05 19:31:45 But you believe scientists when it pertains to other areas, such as medicine, space exploration, oil/gas industry, etc. Or is it simply just too complex of a subject for you to understand?
2985 2018-12-05 19:31:42 ｳﾞｫｰ…
2986 2018-12-05 19:31:34 I thought you set the price of oil and therefore gasoline.  You do know that gasoline is made from oil, right?
2987 2018-12-05 19:31:27 Boy coconut oil do wonders
2988 2018-12-05 19:31:23 Peak oil
2989 2018-12-05 19:31:17 Hell we should have Nuke them after 9/11 as far as i am concerned.  Just take their oil.  But we did nothing after Saudi Arabia was involved in 9/11, why now for one foreign journalist.
2990 2018-12-05 19:31:15 our snowblower’s oil is clean & full, tires inflated correctly AND it started on second pull, so we should get limited (can’t say no) snow this winter season... #wintermyth #wishfulthinking
2991 2018-12-05 19:31:13 Well let’s look at your list. Iran is only allowed to trade oil for humanitarian purposes. Venezuela has descended into the lower circles of hell. Iraq is only trading oil Threw UN oversight. And Libya has been in chaos for a good number of years. So still not worried yet.
2992 2018-12-05 19:31:12 Maybe they could also research  the scientist ( who are not part of the oil business or politically conservative )and are anti pollution and question human caused global warming. There is more to this issue than we want to talk about.
2993 2018-12-05 19:31:11 Who you kidding Sir you’ve said America has more oil than anyone You have showed your disrespect for most of the countries in this world ! Except for Russia and Saudi Arabia two of the worst of them ! Now your worried for the rest of the worlds cost for oil ? HaHs good one Sir

2996 2018-12-05 19:31:05 Dickson warns against shortchanging Bayelsa in oil, gas deals
2997 2018-12-05 19:31:05 It's been because of oil for a lot longer time than that
2998 2018-12-05 19:31:04 People can vote with their wallets and stay away from Dubai.  They are almost out of oil, so hitting tourism may actually have an impact.
2999 2018-12-05 19:31:01 Why shouldn't oil, just like any other commodity, be governed by an economic basic rules: demand vs supply. current oil prices levels call for cartel to lower production to gain a price hike
3000 2018-12-05 19:31:01 I wonder if we'll see Crown Oil @MSportLtd #wrc Fiesta in few rallies??? @GreensmithGus

3003 2018-12-05 19:30:46 Combine 4 tsps zucchini with 2 1/2 pints daikon. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve in 3 inch slices
3004 2018-12-05 19:30:37 Since you consistently take credit for low gas prices. Which are a result of falling oil prices and NOTHING to do with you. Will it be fair to rail against you when they are 1.40 in the spring. Since you like to tske credit u don't deserve.  Government for the rich people
3005 2018-12-05 19:30:32 we’re on a new plane and now they’ve said maintenance is on board putting in a couple of quarts of oil. why would you tell us this??? very distressing

3016 2018-12-05 19:29:23 They have the swf because they have traditionally had a current account surplus with their oil revenues. We don’t want that here! Climate change, keep it in the ground
3017 2018-12-05 19:29:22 Why is Arthur so obsessed with coconut oil?! After every bath he screams the place down until I smother him in it.

3019 2018-12-05 19:29:18 Is there any type of maintenance PM schedule with ur planes?  The captain just informed us maintenance was on board adding a couple quarts of oil.  This is the same passengers that JUST got off flight #4908 .  R U kidding me?

3024 2018-12-05 19:29:10 Yeah, we know, oil and money is ALL you care about!!! #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #TrumpDelusionSyndrome #TrumpIsALiar #TrumpCrimeFamily #DonTheCon #LiarInChief
3025 2018-12-05 19:29:07 Så mangler vi bare Midnight Oil og Blur i stedet for næsefløjtemusik og kastratsangere, eller hvad de nu spiller for tiden.
3026 2018-12-05 19:28:52 My hair line edges always are itching,or burning when I tried to oil it or something. Now I have to do a complete big chop cut just so it can possibly grow again  yeah if anyone read my tweet and can help please do
3027 2018-12-05 19:28:51 Woke up with a tight shoulder and a slowly creeping headache descending, so I took my muscle relaxers. Then I took some cbd oil. Hoping they can head off the headache before I have to add a painkiller, because the last time I had one of my headaches, it hung around for days. 
3028 2018-12-05 19:28:45 Do not allow any more gas/oil exploration Minister. And, in general, just LOOK at what other EU countries are doing to meet Paris agreements. Just copy them. Easy. You might just be on the right side of history on this one
3029 2018-12-05 19:28:40 You wouldn’t want your oil buds that buy condos from you to not make more money. This is a line that only your supporters will believe.
3030 2018-12-05 19:28:22 I was there! My first protest, we chanted “No blood for oil”.
3031 2018-12-05 19:28:17 Mr Trump 
What you are doing about the price of oil is highly appreciated specially by the the poor generation
3032 2018-12-05 19:28:16 Sounds like Autism bingo:
Vaccines
Too much milk
Gluten
He'll eventually eat
Melatonin? But it causes infertility
Cannabis oil will make him speak.

3035 2018-12-05 19:27:57 this is the first time im getting my oil changed without my dad w me </3
3036 2018-12-05 19:27:54 Replace “higher oil prices” with the fake “President Trump” and you’ve finally tweeted reality
3037 2018-12-05 19:27:53 @NPR is currently engaged in some hack-level whitewashing of #Bush41’s war crimes. Taking “military action” against foreign countries to “promote democracy” is called imperialistic violence. Never mind the thousands of people who died because the Bushes wanted oil.
3038 2018-12-05 19:27:41 We live in a free market economy. You don’t get to decide the price of oil.
3039 2018-12-05 19:27:35 I can just see a table full of wizened men who have never used tumblr in their lives clicking their tongues at all the reblogs and likes, wondering how do we tap this oil here - I know, get rid off all that degenerate gay stuff. Oh, and nipples.
3040 2018-12-05 19:27:32 How can we? I admire finesse, you like ponderous, Oil and water 
3041 2018-12-05 19:27:31 They nixed 3 major pipeline projects (2 if you don't want to include KXL) that would result in getting the oil to tidewater.
3042 2018-12-05 19:27:29 Pretty sure the big money is behind oil and gas.   Have you seen Dubai?   That money is not from wind farms.
3043 2018-12-05 19:27:24 I know CBD has helped dogs with epilepsy and anxiety. They have CBD dog treats now, or u can put some oil on a treat, it just depends how big or small ur pup is
3044 2018-12-05 19:27:14 We want all American oil
3045 2018-12-05 19:26:59 You can deadass tastes the hormones mingling on your tongue.. taste like they added a cap full of bleach to the frying oil
3046 2018-12-05 19:26:50 Such a scumbag.Wasnt he just called out tho by a Oil Comp Ceo sayin knock off the bullcrap?
3047 2018-12-05 19:26:35 @ScottAdamsSays do you think @realDonaldTrump will take any interest in Alberta’s plans to restrict oil production and increase CDN #oilprice$$? #tradewar
3048 2018-12-05 19:26:35 Ameen ya allah
3049 2018-12-05 19:26:32 Well, you can always put patchouli or clove oil with some water in a spray bottle, instead.  :P
3050 2018-12-05 19:26:32 Alaska oil dividend - Georgist.
3051 2018-12-05 19:26:31 If as in ethical palm oil corporate awareness campaigns, where 2% of the customer base requires awareness of issue to encourage change at a company like Kellogg's, 17559353 (eligible electors) X 0.02 = magic number 351,187 names required on that petition to provoke action.
3052 2018-12-05 19:26:29 Sweet mother of Middle East. How much oil is in this. BP petrol pump is asking if you can supply them in 2019
3053 2018-12-05 19:26:24 Why would she realize that? She's a Hollywood actress.  Most investors are doing quite well, and oil prices are down.
3054 2018-12-05 19:26:20 Good for American oil producers and energy exporters.  Thanks Ruskies and OPEC.
3055 2018-12-05 19:26:16 Omg yessss me too lol where’s the body oil at lol
3056 2018-12-05 19:26:10 Yea we should’ve did the cannabis oil injection.  Eat a clean gram of it every seasonal change but in reality every day
3057 2018-12-05 19:26:05 Jan. WTI oil down 18 cents, or 0.3%, at $53.07/bbl
3058 2018-12-05 19:26:04 @DollarShaveClub is there a new pre shave oil on the horizon?
3059 2018-12-05 19:25:52 ولا يهمك
حصل خير
3060 2018-12-05 19:25:52 Remember when we burnt coal and distributed radioactive waste directly into our atmosphere? When we burnt oil to move? When we used refrigerants that nuked the ozone layer? Wind power is not that. Let's move to a future that stops nuking the earth before worrying about some birds
3061 2018-12-05 19:25:51 US does that to every country that has oil
3062 2018-12-05 19:25:38 didn't trump chastise Germany for dealing with Russia for oil?
3063 2018-12-05 19:25:35 Is it best to use OPEC or American oil? US oil is more expensive to produce than OPEC and OPEC uses the difference in production cost to slow US oil production.
3064 2018-12-05 19:25:34 yes, loads of people get rich off of climate research, as opposed to *checks notes* the noted poors who run oil, gas, & coal companies
3065 2018-12-05 19:25:33 There he is, the President who lead the charge into the Middle East to represent Texas oil interests more than anything else *sigh* ...may it all rest in peace.

As they play Hail to the Chief, I am reminded of how exceedingly British the United States remains. 

Vive la liberté.
3066 2018-12-05 19:25:26 Everytime I’m going out in the afternoon and I apply my body oil, I always feel like I’m garnishing myself to be fried like meat under this hot sun
3067 2018-12-05 19:25:25 Jones oil has now dropped the price of diesel to 132.9
3068 2018-12-05 19:25:21 Yes the Liberals are responsible for the over production of oil in Alberta, not enough pipelines and the lack of demand for the type of oil that Alberta produces
3069 2018-12-05 19:25:18 But, what does it say? She lost to Trump?! With the backing of Big Oil, Gas And Wall Street? There was no choice between two evils.
3070 2018-12-05 19:25:14 YOU don't need higher oil prices, Fat Boy! The higher they go, the fewer votes you, and your GOP goons, will get in 2020. Hahahaha!
3071 2018-12-05 19:25:04 So true. It's to bad that the federal government won't legalize CBD oil in all states. It could help so many people that r on opioids bc of chronic pain
3072 2018-12-05 19:25:03 It's so good to know Yoongi is burning the midnight oil too. I love you, buddy.
3073 2018-12-05 19:24:59 Well Jim, water and oil don't mix.  So it was best to leave it as it is. The water is pure and clean, refreshing to take in.  The oil is synthetic, as in not real, as in fake.  Sythetic oil is slippery on both sides ;).  But, at this point what difference does it make?
3074 2018-12-05 19:24:58 Trumps investment in coal and oil is thteatened so he jires a hitman thug to do his work. He seems keeps a collection of thugs for every pirpose.
3075 2018-12-05 19:24:53 Good grief. People of Wisconsin are so weak you're begging Bernie for help? 
3076 2018-12-05 19:24:45 Insane to think we are a top, or the largest, oil producer. #GoGreen
3077 2018-12-05 19:24:41 we got a 1000 windmills around here and power is more expensive now than it ever was, my new contact went up 30% this year, now the wind mills are wearing out and puking oil all over the ground, plus they kill birds and start fires.

3087 2018-12-05 19:23:38 If Trump could get oil prices to drop like he does the Dow, gass would be a nickel a gallon.
3088 2018-12-05 19:23:31 @JoMaloneLondon
In complete disbelief many items out of stock in run up to Christmas. Very bad stock planning! Do you know when red roses bath oil will be back in stock? I’m currently a very unjomalone smelling paramedic and I want to cry!! My only luxury! #nhsworkingchristmas
3089 2018-12-05 19:23:25 Terrible experience with MBUSA Customer Service.  My GL350 was under warranty and oil leak found.  Dealership ignored and added oil and said 1qt of oil per 1000 miles is MERCEDES STANDARD protocol.  Now car not under warranty and expensive repairs denied by Mercedes.  @mbusa
3090 2018-12-05 19:23:24 Again it's all about greed they just wanted money and oil.
3091 2018-12-05 19:23:17 Prob a corrupt church. There’s more than most realize! 501c3!!! 

◄ Psalm 23:5 ►KJV
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
3092 2018-12-05 19:22:58 Who cares!?!?? First of all we get most of our oil from Canada, dipshit and second of all it's not worth one person's life!
3093 2018-12-05 19:22:55 I'd try osmo but if that's not 'yellow' enough maybe try Liberon hard oil.
3094 2018-12-05 19:22:50 We r not dependent on Saudis. US is now # one oil producer in the world & allot of what we import comes from Canada. We don't need Saudis. There is no 450 billion arms deal with Saudis. The only reason 4 not condemning Saudi Prince is Trump's & Kushner's real estate interests.
3095 2018-12-05 19:22:47 #Facebook is like a supertanker, steaming ahead and spilling oil to the sea. It is time to regulate what they (and others) can do with our data.
3096 2018-12-05 19:22:38 Women are not machines.  They do not require motor oil.  (Why do I have to say this?)
3097 2018-12-05 19:22:27 What percentage of people around my age know how to perform basic tasks on a car like changing oil and tire maintenance
3098 2018-12-05 19:22:19 In which case, how about one of those abandoned oil platforms in the middle of the North Sea? There would be nothing but birds for miles and miles and they can fly away.
3099 2018-12-05 19:22:16 So hydraulic oil spill in the ocean?
3100 2018-12-05 19:22:00 No offense to your career, but I imagine you've heard of electric cars, and solar and wind power. Biodegradable plastics can be made out of plant materials. Maybe I should have said "stop burning oil", though, perhaps some limited uses remain, e.g. for lubricants etc.
3101 2018-12-05 19:21:50 So how much Oil  do you think we’re getting out of Iraq right now?  Also the question was who do you trust. We’re kind of getting in the weeds.  I didn’t agree with the invasion of Iraq , I think Saudi Arabia is the least of our worries.
3102 2018-12-05 19:21:41 Every politician in recent history including Rubio has made the U.S. dependant on Saudi oil. This has made any retaliation against them impossible and they know it. Trump on the other hand has zero to do with our dependency and is unable to do anything about it. Facts matter.
3103 2018-12-05 19:21:34 can't believe the finish on these doors and frames best water based finish I have seen same sheen as oil. brilliant I bet your customer was impressed.
3104 2018-12-05 19:21:25 Very surprised to see little change in pump prices despite recent fall in global oil prices.
3105 2018-12-05 19:21:14 I feel a mighty need to through potato sticks into hot oil.
3106 2018-12-05 19:21:07 Sir, I’ve worked for lawyers for 30 years. I assure you there are many lawyers in every large corp, including oil corps, that have nothing to do with litigation. Some are even Democrats! Unless you know who these evil lawyers are, what they do & why they donated, please sit down.
3107 2018-12-05 19:21:03 The riots MIGHT have more to do with an elitist little tyrant / EU puppet of a President enacting exorbitant gas/oil taxes on the French public to enforce a Globalist/EU/UN phony climate change agenda than FACEBOOK
3108 2018-12-05 19:21:00 Someone just made +13.48% sell on WCX WTI Crude Oil 20x leverage @ 53.404 → 53.044  ~ OOOULALA $WTICO $USD
3109 2018-12-05 19:20:47 I wish oil prices goes to over $ 100 if you kept putting the world on edge by your commercial policies
3110 2018-12-05 19:20:23 I hate economics especially when it comes to oil. It is not a renewable resource. We will eventually run out. Probably not in our lifetime, or even the planets lifetime at the rate that carbon gases are depleting our environment. Need to find better energy sources.
3111 2018-12-05 19:20:15 He is telling them to raise the oil prices
3112 2018-12-05 19:20:05 @glossier hey are your priming moisturiser and milky jelly cleanser products oil free?
3113 2018-12-05 19:20:04 Trump never murdered people for oil and money as the Bushes did.
3114 2018-12-05 19:19:56 Na normal thing for December na
3115 2018-12-05 19:19:55 Nothing left to do for the people of Vermont?
3116 2018-12-05 19:19:51 Get rid of the fed, let the market dictate interest rates. Start making things in this country, so people can have income. That will generate real GDP. Shrink gvmt to a small level, go back to the gold standard, cut military spending, cut government welfare to farmers and oil.
3117 2018-12-05 19:19:39 That pisses off everyone who has stock in oil. It would compete with oil and oil prices would go down even more.
3118 2018-12-05 19:19:33 Ameen
3119 2018-12-05 19:19:28 I doubt it, but if you are younger than me it shows. If phasing out oil is your point; then by all means lead the charge. Only ride a bike, get rid of the paths and roads you ride that bike on, get rid of the plastic helmet you use while you ride that bike. Talk is easy sir.
3120 2018-12-05 19:19:16 The US already produces more oil than needed.
3121 2018-12-05 19:19:15 I will never forget the day me chris and my brother went to the club and one of the dancers cane up to us asking what we do. I told her my brother was a marine and I work in the oil fields. She asked my buddy chris what he does and he said he was a real estate agent.
3122 2018-12-05 19:19:09 This is why I can't believe we aren't going heavy into nuclear energy and electric cars. Running out of oil means a huge impact on electronics, medicine, medical equipment, and thousands of other necessary parts of our modern age.
3123 2018-12-05 19:19:05 [pouring olive oil into the pan]
3124 2018-12-05 19:19:05 I want @RSPOtweets to vote to ensure palm oil companies adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #palmoil policies. I can’t bear to see our #rainforests & precious #orangutan habitat destroyed #RSPO #RT16
3125 2018-12-05 19:19:04 No. The hydraulic oil tank in the tractor is big enough. Older models did have a system you describe.

3131 2018-12-05 19:18:37 I’m so short that I have to push back my drivers seat when I go to get my oil changed so the mechanic can get in 
3132 2018-12-05 19:18:36 They don't care. To them Khashoggi was a terrorist. His death is uninteresting. Saudi Arabia has the money and the oil and the influence.
3133 2018-12-05 19:18:31 The funny thing is, most free market citizens recognize Trump as a manipulator and likely won't vote for him. I was a big supporter of him until his tariffs and oil manipulation started. I did a complete 180 turn on him.
3134 2018-12-05 19:18:26 So Beta O'Rourke is gonna run in 2020. He couldn't even beat Ted Cruz just saying.
3135 2018-12-05 19:18:23 The US is the only country with the power to hold them accountable. They'd laugh at any other country for even trying. Nothing will be done though because of money and oil.
3136 2018-12-05 19:18:23 My legacy will look better than Bush's. Because I didn't drive our country to war and murdered people for power, money, and oil. Like George HW Bush did.
3137 2018-12-05 19:18:20 "I just take it in to jiffy lube and they always tell me I need an oil change, blinker fluid, and calipers, pads, and rotors"
3138 2018-12-05 19:18:19 I thought about the pet CBD oil. I use my oil for everything!!
3139 2018-12-05 19:18:10 Yall gotta stop stressin. Its not gon help. Jus relax n trust that God got you. Every failure isnt a destination. Its just a pitstop. Learn from it, tune yourself up and get back out there. Dont mope because God is changing your oil and your tires. 
3140 2018-12-05 19:18:09 It’s almost as if blockchain is a hollow, transparent scam, electronic snake oil used by shysters and crooks
3141 2018-12-05 19:18:06 You will always be a fringe party unless you start embracing the reality of demand for energy.
Stomping your feet and yelling at people to stop using oil isn’t going to magically make green options 100% reliable. There’s a transition phase that needs to happen
3142 2018-12-05 19:18:03 Yes but Ir keep them in check until Bush oil mission.
3143 2018-12-05 19:18:03 Oil is not really a good source of energy, it takes a lot of energy to make gasoline.
It's also not a renewable energy.
Let's move forward with clean renewable energy for all things
Just saying

3147 2018-12-05 19:17:51 We must block all palm oil. Even if it's not from deforestation, it's no good. We should use local oils.
3148 2018-12-05 19:17:51 There wasn’t actually any oil in my car and my engine was probably about to melt but hey. Small accomplishments
3149 2018-12-05 19:17:49 I’m mad bc I didn’t learn anything new about painting in fucking PAINTING class this semester, which should have happened because I was forced to spend ACTUAL HUNDREDS of dollars on oil paint that i never got taught how to fucking use.

3153 2018-12-05 19:17:41 What's silly is using a picture of the premier where she refused to sign the leap manifesto and trying to paint her as anti oil. Makes it look like you are lying for political gain. You wouldn't do that would you?

3157 2018-12-05 19:17:33 Using charities to pay bribes to win oil and construction contracts in Africa? That is really corrupt and deplorable. What was the return on his $2MM bribe?

@ToestringRd
3158 2018-12-05 19:17:32 I think what I learned was that through horizontal organization there are a lot of different groups involved. There is such a high % of French citizens that support the protestors. I find fault in the non ecological side of it-globally we need to end oil addiction.
3159 2018-12-05 19:17:30 Pres Uhuru Kenyatta is either confused or someone is confusing him, mara ameongeza oil tax, amekopa china doo zingine, anaongea leo kupunguza mizigo, he appoints a 91 granpa to deal with affairs ya vijana, then hoodwink us na vow(tumezoea) not to sign bill ya manguruwe flani
3160 2018-12-05 19:17:19 I wouldn’t say the deficiency of these oils in the diet cause this. But there is definitely a link between our diets that lack major nutrients and dementia. 

Updating our diets and switching to coconut oil could potentially help slow down dementia progression.
3161 2018-12-05 19:17:19 Yo, it depends. So many. I like using lemons and limes, soy sauce, cooking wine and oil for the marinade and I’ll throw on salt, pepper, oregano, rosemary, thyme, parsley if I go more traditional American but I’ll also use more Dominican seasonings or even turmeric too
3162 2018-12-05 19:17:14 Howl to the moon!

Prices are low because
- there is an oil glut
- recession is looming
- producers with highest costs (extraction from bituminous schists) shall by driven out of the market.

OPEC will increase prices as soon as possible, whatever you tweet.

Acknowledge basics.
3163 2018-12-05 19:17:10 Of course the MSM #FakeNews won’t report on it. When they do it’s misleading!#FakeNews saying they are protesting bc of fuel prices when oil is cheaper then it’s been in years. Say it for what it is TAXES !!!! @POTUS told them all and they mocked& ridiculed him.Whos laughing now
3164 2018-12-05 19:17:08 High Oil prices aren't all that bad.
3165 2018-12-05 19:16:57 There’s a few, but here’s one of them. 

“For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.”
 
Hosea 2:5
3166 2018-12-05 19:16:52 My testicles used to hang unevenly, with my left ball approximately 4 inches lower than my right. I took one hit on CBD oil and now both balls hang evenly with each other.

3169 2018-12-05 19:16:26 Albolene IS baby oil gel.
A good lube--but Hawaiian Tropic dark tanning oil is better. Smells great too!
3170 2018-12-05 19:16:22 That's exactly how other environmentally conscious countries feel about the U.S. and our dependency on oil,  coal, pollutant producing manufacturing, and our ignoring CLEAN ENERGY OPTIONS. A litterer is not defined by quantity or quality, but by action.
3171 2018-12-05 19:16:21 Great product, but it has so much oil!!!!!!!!!! lol
3172 2018-12-05 19:16:15 What, you'd be like a soft, malleable greyish-yellow paste, made from ground chalk and raw linseed oil? Weirdo
3173 2018-12-05 19:16:14 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
3174 2018-12-05 19:16:14 There is no 450 billion dollar deal with the Saudis, except in Trump's mind. We r not dependent on Saudi oil in the least. All the reasons not 2 call 4 Saudi Prince 2 b ousted because of Khashoggi murder r fake. Real reason, Trump & Kushner make allot of money off the Saudis.
3175 2018-12-05 19:16:07 If I break your heart na oil spillage
3176 2018-12-05 19:16:03 I made the keto friendly eggrolls and they are so delicious!!!...I fear Im going to eat the whole pan...I made them with pork, cole slaw veggie mix, minced garlic, minced ginger, chopped green onion, soy sauce, and just a dab of sesame oil..looks like I'll be fat fasting tomorrow
3177 2018-12-05 19:15:51 A rich country with diamonds. Platinum. Gold. Oil. Copper plus whole lot more. But it's still broke. Management is a joke.
3178 2018-12-05 19:15:44 Why should I worry about a dead man? George He Bush didn't care about the people he murdered. He only cared about the money, power, and oil he got from murdering people.
3179 2018-12-05 19:15:30 @SenToomey #rejectmcnamee we can't keep having the fox guarding the hen house at FERC with another shill coming thru the revolving door from the oil & gas industry

3181 2018-12-05 19:15:26 ... comes from is kinda irrelevant. The oil will always have somewhere to go (ie. fungible), and with X amount on the market, any increase to that X amount will drive down the cost everywhere. Also, we're net importers, did you know that? 
3182 2018-12-05 19:15:19 Same thing happened when Rockerfeller's Standard oil pushed for alcohol prohibition in order to kill the competition (ethanol fueled cars).
3183 2018-12-05 19:15:15 As long as it smells like an essential oil lmao
3184 2018-12-05 19:15:14 ...jumper cables, flares or triangle reflectors, a quart of motor oil, a gallon of coolant, first aid kit, blanket, flashlight with extra batteries, tool kit, a can of tire inflator and sealant, paper towels, energy bars, and bottled...

3187 2018-12-05 19:14:54 This is disingenuous, big oil would be happy to invest in clean energy if it was more cost effective, which it isnt yet.  Once it is, they will be more than ready to change.
3188 2018-12-05 19:14:48 That’s not happening any time soon. Let’s just enjoy the win. Very few these days. Also, BLM had to leave a million acres off the chopping block for oil and gas leases. It’s been a good week.
3189 2018-12-05 19:14:42 But how many can afford diapers? Or will be able to afford them in 20 years time? Speak to P&G and beware purveyors of oil.

3198 2018-12-05 19:13:49 I think it’s the, uh, rebound. My sister was severely asthmatic as a child, so my mother made her take lots of cod liver oil (supposedly b/c it helped the asthma, no clue if that’s really true). She always had these really nasty fishy burps that we all could smell. 
3199 2018-12-05 19:13:43 The thing about oil is that it's a fungible commodity. Oil goes everywhere to everyone. So, oil from West Texas goes on the market just like the oil from SA or Russia, and the market determines the price according to mostly-typical supply/demand rules. So, where "our" oil...

3205 2018-12-05 19:13:13 One MUST be fool to believe that Russia will cut oil output.
3206 2018-12-05 19:13:02 I guess I really screwed up being 33 last year by NOT owning an olive oil and balsamic vinegar store

3212 2018-12-05 19:12:40 As you’re aware, OPEC oil matters little to us. Real Presidents before you planned & accomplished our being virtually independent from foreign oil. But, you just keep lying, hoping congress won’t sanction the Saudis & halt arms sales to them. OK, Pinocchio?  @CIA
3213 2018-12-05 19:12:32 Smt. The wrap was good but the gyal basically put oil all over my salad. She didn’t even shake the italian dressing properly.. now my wrap soggy with oil. 
3214 2018-12-05 19:12:16 We don’t want to see and we certainly don’t need despots murdering journalists either. In fact, I think we’d all gladly pay more for oil if it meant murderous despots were brought to justice.

3216 2018-12-05 19:12:06 sure they can, hydraulic can stall for sure.  oil is incompressible so it can lock like a rock in some modes.

3223 2018-12-05 19:11:42 It's part of UN Agenda 21's "sustainable development" to reclaim the earth & depopulate the world: eliminate resources -oil, mining, forestry, cattle/beef, farms, private property, asphalt; cars, religion. Most people unaware, MSM complicit. Must get rid of unelected UN and NGOs.

3228 2018-12-05 19:11:31 Itu menggumpal karna oil. Jadi sebelum dipake ya dikocok dulu
3229 2018-12-05 19:11:30 I saw my mom put some essential oil in our humidifier and set to full blast. Idk what she’s trying to do to this family but I’m suspicious af.
3230 2018-12-05 19:11:29 America has the edge over China in designing and making high-end chips. China remains reliant on the outside world for supplies of high-end chips. It spends more on semiconductor imports than it does on oil. The top 15 semiconductor firms do not include a single Chinese name.
3231 2018-12-05 19:11:28 I did wear it in a braid often and put beads in it sometimes.

The main reason for the cut is the ends were getting scraggly and thin looking, on top of it getting in the way, burnt, and caught in stuff.  I've been using beard oil and balm to try and maintain better care.
3232 2018-12-05 19:11:26 Never mind that lower oil prices would force all north american operations out of business, it would also slaughter the dividends of those companies too. Many of which our held by fixed income/dividend strategies of the standard baby-boomer portfolio & their vote counts in 2020.
3233 2018-12-05 19:11:24 the REAL WORLD runs on oil all day everyday
3234 2018-12-05 19:11:23 Would be a great road trip to see the Oil!!!
3235 2018-12-05 19:11:20 @NTB When will you guys get it together!. This place is in a nice area but you can expect poor service and at least a 3 to 4 hour wait for JUST an Oil change and you must watch them they will damage things on your car and not say anything.

3236 2018-12-05 19:11:18 Well has @RepBetoORourke received donations from the oil/gas industry. @davidsirota is pretty reputable. Don’t you think?

3238 2018-12-05 19:11:05 i got three songs into oil of every pearl's un-insides and nah
3239 2018-12-05 19:11:05 I need a spa/beauty day. Not even for soft ass self-care but like, routine maintenance. I'm way over the mileage on my sticker mane. I need a facial and a deep tissue massage bad, I need a hot oil treatment BAD... I'm sputtering up the highway at this point
3240 2018-12-05 19:10:59 Tip:  Cast Iron Skillet 
NO water.  Remove debris with cloth or paper towel
Put in 500F oven for 35 minutes.
Turn off heat, leave skillet in oven to cool.  
Wha-Bam!!!  It's sterilized for next use.  
Lightly wipe oil across skillet and hang 'til next time!

3245 2018-12-05 19:10:41 130 years ago, Standard Oil's behavior inspired waves of regulation aimed at promoting competition and bustin up a bad actor--the Interstate Commerce Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act, etc.
3246 2018-12-05 19:10:38 I’ve seen some type of oil and a toothbrush specifically dedicated to brush the baby hairs back lmao.

3250 2018-12-05 19:10:06 They r protesting the Carbon Tax! & the Globalist Agenda! Oil prices are at significant LOWS! But their idiot leaders are making them artificially high by the addition of CARBON taxes; & other increased taxation to an already over taxed populace:meant 2pay4 3rd world importation.

3252 2018-12-05 19:10:01 The people at my oil changing place talk to me like im a child and I honestly appreciate it
3253 2018-12-05 19:10:00 From 1985 to 1998, we had layoff notices in October so we could be fired by Christmas. I was downsized at Christmas 1998. I've stayed in the industry for going on 38 years. Local press covered the job losses, mostly. It's a boom/bust business with a "buck up buttercup" mindset...

3255 2018-12-05 19:09:52 Oil and water
3256 2018-12-05 19:09:51 I usually after dying my hair put some conditioner and olive oil on it and my scalp and let it sit for an hour then wash my hair as I normally would. It moisturizes your hair and scalp so the dye doesn't dry it out
3257 2018-12-05 19:09:50 Trump supporters never research anything. It's amazing, they still believe we r dependent on Saudi oil, we need 2 drill more oil in US because Dems block oil cos from drilling, Saudi is investing 450 billion in US. None of this is true.
3258 2018-12-05 19:09:50 That's awesome! Here's hoping it continues :) Yep, he was having 4-8 seizures a month on average. He hasn't had a single one in almost 8 months since starting on the CBD oil. Wonderful stuff :)
3259 2018-12-05 19:09:50 i got really strong oil cartridges and completely abandoned the narrative in my audition tape for the real world
3260 2018-12-05 19:09:46 Even though Americans use very little oil from the Middle East. Unfortunately, everyone has let OPEC set the price. We don't need their damn oil! I noticed this morning that gas prices went up about 15 cents. The rubes have a very short-term memory!
3261 2018-12-05 19:09:38 Just getting over a 10 day terrible cold. Here’s what helped me: boil water, pour into large bowl/pot, 5 drops of eucalyptus oil/peppermint oil, cover head with towel and place face over vapor- breathe deep. Offered fleeting respite. Also humidifier.

3266 2018-12-05 19:09:17 Every time I write about the potential harms of oil and gas activity I find members of that industry look up my LinkedIn profile. Mkay.
3267 2018-12-05 19:09:13 Many people in Texas work in the oil and gas industry. 

Individuals donating through groups indicate who they work for, ie, oil and gas. 
Please go back and review.

3269 2018-12-05 19:09:05 Srsly tho. One term president, former CIA head, got us into a war against a US ally (disturbing as that was, for sure) to protect rich Arabs and oil prices.

Just saying.

When I hear that the Administration does not support renewable energy but would rather that we retain coal as our primary fuel, followed closely by oil and gasoline...I cringe.
3280 2018-12-05 19:08:09 people don't need to be forced to use coal and oil by the greedy assholes who sell it and their store bought presidential servant boy.

3296 2018-12-05 19:07:14 It’s not about energy it’s about money... opec nor the president can restrict sunshine or wind- we could all have 100% renewable energy if those who are profiting from oil would give up their cash cow. Change will come, and perhaps much more quickly than most are expecting
3297 2018-12-05 19:07:06 So it's 600,000 barrels of oil and not 600... 600 was bad enough

3307 2018-12-05 19:06:10 Uhh? Nuclear was promoted in France to replace oil, which it didn't. Both countries now face problems because of their 40 year old nuclear bet: to fill the gap after closing down ageing reactors... they'll need as much renewables as Germany, because new nuclear is too expensive.

3329 2018-12-05 19:04:08 Basically, the price at which consumers begin to want to use less oil is steadily dropping (though gas demand is pretty sticky in the short-term) so there's a chance for rapid progress in the 2020s if things cut the right way. My best guess is that the next recession helps.

3344 2018-12-05 19:02:59 US is a net exporter of oil now (thanks to Obama). So how will low oil prices help us ? All things considered it does not benefit US any more. But how would you know that, because you don't want to know  that.

3359 2018-12-05 19:01:34 Cantu dries out my hair tremendously so I stopped using it, then I started using African pride and the only plus is that my curls look great. My hair feels dry.

3360 2018-12-05 19:01:30 No I first you oo
3361 2018-12-05 19:01:03 That's real comedy.
3362 2018-12-05 19:00:57 1) No, actually that PROVES MY POINT. Solar cells are becoming cheaper but not at the rate & tanking the economy in PIPE DREAMS helps no one.
2) America is rich in OIL. That isn't the problem. We can only drill so much & refine at a certain rate. It's a demand pipeline problem!
3363 2018-12-05 19:00:54 I have 5 skids of oil, we're not carrying that brand anymore, so I have to receive it, store it, then someone has to pick it so we can ship it back to the manufacturer.
I'm not making this up. Thank you management
3364 2018-12-05 19:00:52 Is the cod liver oil I just spilled all over a butcher block countertop gonna help it or hurt it? Time will tell… (Also, cod liver is delicious, why does it have such a bad rap?)
3365 2018-12-05 19:00:50 Keep America dependant on Saudi oil! DELUSIONAL DONNIE doesn’t see a future with renewable energy. Perhaps he thinks there’s no future in solar power because the days are shorter in the winter?
3366 2018-12-05 19:00:49 Im confused... Aioli has always been vegan. At least the original recipe. It is literally garlic, oil and salt.

3367 2018-12-05 19:00:44 Only way the human race will thrive again is to have freedom from fossil fuels. The technology has been here for a long time. However the big oil companies have used there power to squash clean energy researchers and developers.

3378 2018-12-05 18:59:53 Or a ‘compromise’ when we’re offered nothing (HPA, CC resiprocity, etc) in return for their bullshit #notoneinch
3379 2018-12-05 18:59:51 He makes climate change (which is #fakenews) so much worse! His 1 month of jet use for Dem campaigning is more damaging than my dismantling of the EPA small particulate panel, my new plan to increase oil drilling, and getting rid of electric car rebates combined!!! #Iwantcleanair
3380 2018-12-05 18:59:50 Leans a little too much on the revisionist Rip It Up narrative, I also found it too London-centric (but in fairness great on Scottish oil fields & Falklands)
3381 2018-12-05 18:59:42 Both given a pie of the Saudis oil
3382 2018-12-05 18:59:40 Thoughts on seeds oil being the culprit to skin burns?   I’m pretty pale and cut out the seed oils and seemed to not burn as easily using NO sunscreens this past summer.
3383 2018-12-05 18:59:37 To get the better rate as a negotiating block with Alberta so oil companies don't exploit us as much.
And we need to reduce production over the next decade to get to 0 burned oil before 2030.
3384 2018-12-05 18:59:33 While does he need lower oil price?  Because it's really hurting countries who are solely dependent on oil.
3385 2018-12-05 18:59:23 So, why do we not return to using whale oil to light our homes at night, and fire wood to cook our food?
3386 2018-12-05 18:59:16 If you noticed that the distribution of Solar Photovolatic electricity generation has been slowed greatly while Shale Oil and Fracking for Gas have been expanded. It is almost like somebody wants to purposely eliminate a large portion of the population.
3387 2018-12-05 18:59:15 Just curious what is  purpose...??? Do they go out on the open market and purchase oil and resell to local gas distributors...is it for profit...??? Do we even need it..??
3388 2018-12-05 18:59:08 Your willingness to regurgitate the bullshit coal and oil companies feed you is disgusting. The world survived just fine before Coal Power, we do not need it for CO2.

Oil and coal companies spent lots of money keeping wind, solar and tidal power technologies from the public.
3389 2018-12-05 18:59:08 They were likely full on communism, ban the oil sands.
3390 2018-12-05 18:58:57 Didn't you give The Saudis a mulligan on the Murder of khashoggi so that we wouldn't have to pay higher oil prices?  @cnn @MSNBC @foxnews @PressSec @WhiteHouse @GOPChairwoman @gop @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
3391 2018-12-05 18:58:52 Ameen
3392 2018-12-05 18:58:47 Qatar leaving OPEC the Oil Producers organisation, could have possible big consequences for energy and political policies in the future.
3393 2018-12-05 18:58:45 Somewhere in this scattershot approach of wide ranging predictions the truth may be present? From cooling to warming and now just general change, staying away from hard predictions, the left learns and adjusts its sales tactics continually.
3394 2018-12-05 18:58:43 Ladies please recommend some nice body nite oil...a lady was misled
3395 2018-12-05 18:58:40 You so eagerly trade the blood of a journalist for the oil of a tyrant.

3397 2018-12-05 18:58:38 Most intelligent Norwegians say the decision not to join the EU was a mistake. Without Norway’s North Sea Oil - Thatcher squandered ours on tax-cuts for the rich, Norway invested theirs for the good of the country - it would be a disaster.
3398 2018-12-05 18:58:32 i farm on both sides on highway 16 with a busy oil:rail car loading facility a half mile away.  ~300 heavy trucks each day.   and the DOt weigh scale is 8 miles down the Road.   We have to play by the rules here. high risk, some guys get to farm in the boonies and run junk.
3399 2018-12-05 18:58:15 “Canadians”, as a vague general group, don’t elect or “kick out” @ElizabethMay. Her constituents in the riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands do

She's representing her constituents on this file, as oil shipping is a significant threat to their economy, environment, way of life & health
3400 2018-12-05 18:58:11 It's incredible that so many are in denial and still being taken in by the oil lobby #ClimateActionNow
3401 2018-12-05 18:57:49 I agree Myriam. The hypocrisy and lack of action by my government absolutely disgusts me, it’s about time people stopped allowing the Saudis to manipulate other countries just because they can control the price of oil. It’s disgusting that profit is put before people’s lives.
3402 2018-12-05 18:57:49 we're all gonna die in 40 years because of the oil industry and yet you're mad at someone else for pointing out someone on your team was bought by that self same industry. cool man
3403 2018-12-05 18:57:45 Because their leaders {Dem party] sold their soul to the highest bidders of the muslimbrotherhood. Paid to sell out anything & anyone. How do u think all Dempartyleaders got so wealthy? Muzzies got deep pockets- ya know when u sell OIL to the world
3404 2018-12-05 18:57:42 Electric doesn’t help his master Putin. Coal and oil do.
3405 2018-12-05 18:57:34 Was sind Wichteltüren?
3406 2018-12-05 18:57:27 they are oil barons, no?
The other stuff is just pocket change for them as long as they can influence oil prices & policy..
3407 2018-12-05 18:57:21 Even though I have talked about getting fuel oil since we moved in this house I have not done it......  Which means who do you recommend for best price and service???
3408 2018-12-05 18:57:18 Cheaper oil, for the price of a life? Sign me up!

Also, since it's been proven that a life (and therefore a soul) is worth $250 billion, can I mortgage 25% of my soul for $60 billion? It's a deal, and I need the cash. Thanks!
3409 2018-12-05 18:57:15 if Alberta's oil resources belong to Alberta as @RachelNotley said on CBC radio this morning, why should my Province (BC) have to risk its environment in order to move Alberta's resource to export????
3410 2018-12-05 18:57:09 Just follow your nose... War, oil, the Bush Family...
3411 2018-12-05 18:57:08 As an investor of many oil companies it makes no sense to explore and salad these prices
3412 2018-12-05 18:57:07 Eating 2 tablespoons of coconut oil is so gross BUT has so many benefits 
Abdominal weight loss being one of them... ugh
3413 2018-12-05 18:57:00 Someone just made +12.66% sell on WCX WTI Crude Oil 20x leverage @ 53.543 → 53.204  ~ OOOULALA $WTICO $USD
3414 2018-12-05 18:56:59 Oil prices are based on supply and demand.
3415 2018-12-05 18:56:58 He'll return to snake oil salesman as soon as he can find another snake.
3416 2018-12-05 18:56:51 They could start by stop buying Saudi oil 
See how that works out for them
3417 2018-12-05 18:56:40 Robots don’t fart... they have oil bubbles
3418 2018-12-05 18:56:27 Manipulating oil stocks now huh.
3419 2018-12-05 18:56:25 Trump is catering to the oils barons and coal mine owners who paid for his campaign.  Hence adding MORE leakable pipelines and reopening dead coal mines.  More dirt in the air.  More potential oil leaks on land.  More dead energy.  Investing in obsolete energy is stupidity!
3420 2018-12-05 18:56:24 @Starbucks STOP USING PALM OIL
3421 2018-12-05 18:56:20 I get that, there’s no predicting that stuff until it happens.

What blows my mind is that it was so bad/so poorly managed that his hospitalization resulted in a 20 pound weight loss.... Did they ignore the initial reaction & hook him up to an IV of sesame oil?
3422 2018-12-05 18:56:18 Oil change complete please dispatch me on SC10 9521 Bettendorf dropping by UPS Davenport on the way
3423 2018-12-05 18:56:09 Emily tweeted that the cake she posted is NOT the cake in question..I do not understand why she would have posted that pic..However THE point is $1000.00 should not have been spent on a cake and an extravagant party was unnecessary.. it does not negate the fact of the oil loss!
3424 2018-12-05 18:56:04 CBD oil and a vape hit!
3425 2018-12-05 18:55:52 @BigBlackBarry oil losses account for 14.5% of the education budget and more than justice ministry budget. This financial year.
3426 2018-12-05 18:55:46 Imagine the whole time we here thinking a The drugs thing did a waps we up and it’s a bag of oil scamming
3427 2018-12-05 18:55:46 Oil has been low for 4 years finally the cancelled projects from back then have an impact
3428 2018-12-05 18:55:44 You’re correct, sir. We don’t need higher oil prices, because we don’t need oil. Give us ethanol! #Brazil
3429 2018-12-05 18:55:41 1) FALSE: Renewables are CHEAPER ONLY DUE TO GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES.
2) Two years ago, Saudi Arabia & the other OPEC nations declared an oil war with America. We get small quantities at inconsistent intervals.
3430 2018-12-05 18:55:39 Depression: I just want to sit here and sleep
Literally me: Time to get the fuck up. I need an oil change.
Depression: Self care is lame
Me: You're lame.
3431 2018-12-05 18:55:38 Snake oil salesman.
3432 2018-12-05 18:55:35 No. I thought it's an open secret ka ini. Is this mearnt to be a secret? Honestly. I don't like his siding with the regime too, but the cooking oil reference is just too obvious guys.
3433 2018-12-05 18:55:35 The day Will come when oil is no longer needed for fuel for transport or heating its already happening then the world will throw the Saudis out like the garbage they are.
3434 2018-12-05 18:55:30 Sucks that she using that watery ass Queene Helene lotion tho. Try the baby oil gel or Vaseline Intensive Lotion Cocoa Butter or Aloe types.
3435 2018-12-05 18:55:27 Market are awesome they solve all the problems
Oil inflation was a problem market crush oil price
Rate was to high and fed was raising to much market crush rate and inflation expectations by lowering commodity price 
Trade war was a problem market push China and US into a deal
3436 2018-12-05 18:55:23 i'm making crepes i have so much oil on my hands rn it's almost as greasy as dongmin's hair in miigb
3437 2018-12-05 18:55:22 Wasn't just lies. Iraq has oil and Afghanistan has all those strategic mineral deposits...
3438 2018-12-05 18:55:21 #TariffMan my guess is oil producers do.
3439 2018-12-05 18:55:18 We progressed on alternative energy while our oil production hit record highs under Obama. We r now # 1 oil producer in the world. Great strides were made in solar power & electric cars, which r now being hurt by Trump's policies. Please stop living in a world of misinformation.
3440 2018-12-05 18:55:13 @KateAronoff Is the No Fossil Fuels Pledge worth anything? Because for example, on Open Secrets it says Beto O'Rourke takes the most money from Oil and Gas industry of any congressperson. What's the story?
3441 2018-12-05 18:55:02 I use baby oil
3442 2018-12-05 18:55:01 WHAT?  Can no one at Global spell Drayton Valley?   I hope this will continue in communities all over Alberta.   Saskatchewan also needs to get out there in the streets.   We are being totally ignored and yet OIL contributed billions to the Federal coffers over many years.
3443 2018-12-05 18:54:52 damn, my maintenance required light came on & yk my daddy gone snap cause he been told me to get the oil 
3444 2018-12-05 18:54:48 Actually, we do need higher oil prices - we need to get off of fossil fuels, dolt!
3445 2018-12-05 18:54:42 Well, $300bn of energy bondholders, of which u maybe one of them, disagree too. So does an entire supply chain of goods & services. Falling State taxes or royalty incomes are to be consider. Lower for longer oil prices are a net negative for the US, not a „tax cut“. #OOTT
3446 2018-12-05 18:54:32 Truth isn't vile. What's vile is the lies on the left? You all act like the 90s and early 00s didn't just happen. The Bush's are worse than Trump. The Bush's killed and murdered peope for power, money, and oil. Trump didn't.
3447 2018-12-05 18:54:31 I want a ban on oil tankers everywhere. I want a ban on the fossil fuel industry entirely.
3448 2018-12-05 18:54:29 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their goat ate their keys
3449 2018-12-05 18:54:20 Very knowledgeable about any auto. I believe they are the best at fuel inspection set up but they do all auto work from oil change to engine replacement.
3450 2018-12-05 18:54:10 Low oil prices means thousands out of work in the oilfield.  My husband has been off since August.
3451 2018-12-05 18:54:09 Landed in St. Louis.  Game 20 of #31in31NHL tonight. @StLouisBlues hosting @EdmontonOilers My fifth and final time on adventure seeing the Oil’. (They won’t miss me, they’re 1-and-3 w/ me in attendance) #simmerpaloosa @StellickSimmer @SiriusXMNHL @Summerskates
3452 2018-12-05 18:54:09 Wondering the other day if all the oil we've been pumping out of the ground was keeping the lava cool. If so? Wow, we're in for some shaking & volcanic times.
#ClimateChange #CO2
3453 2018-12-05 18:54:07 The quality of life is nowhere nearly as bad as u think. Iran has the 17th largest economy in the world, the 4th largest reserves of oil, 2nd largest reserves of natural gas, produces 1.5 million cars a year, free healthcare for all citizens. Don't believe the propaganda.
3454 2018-12-05 18:54:03 I’m Slick As An Oil Well Owned By Shell.. lol
3455 2018-12-05 18:54:00 Someone just made +11.92% sell on WCX WTI Crude Oil 20x leverage @ 53.523 → 53.204  ~ OOOULALA $WTICO $USD

3458 2018-12-05 18:53:38 Your putting me on the spot eh ..... Currently 85% if my portfolio is in CDN oil and gas companies
3459 2018-12-05 18:53:32 That will have a pto and independant oil system then?
3460 2018-12-05 18:53:22 What the... How? It's amazing
3461 2018-12-05 18:53:13 cooking with fresh ingredients : yes, good. perfect amount of oil. perfect temperature. knife skills on point. this is gonna be delish.

prepackaged meals in the oven : IS IT GOING TO COOK ??? HOW IS IT GOING TO COOK ??? /opens the door every 5 minutes/ IS IT COOKING RIGHT ?!?!?!

3467 2018-12-05 18:52:46 In nobler times, the world was ruled by wood, canvas, leather, rope, and sharp edges. Now, it's steel, oil, engines, and blunt instruments. Fuck the present.
3468 2018-12-05 18:52:41 Posted waiting for my car to get a oil change. Anyone wanna match after ? Or get breakfast? Or some
3469 2018-12-05 18:52:38 Just because I feel like making "that post.."
A man who is responsible for millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and the birth of Middle East oil/terrorism is dead and we're acting like a Mother Teresa/John Paul hybrid archangel just ascended. 
2018 Blinders are GOLDEN!
3470 2018-12-05 18:52:38 I usually agree with POTUS but this call is wrong. There is a huge world oversupply of oil and will ruin U.S. domestic producers unless OPEC rebalances supply exports with world demand.
3471 2018-12-05 18:52:36 In another light, even if these artifacts are not retailer, our museums are hardly in any shape or maintenance to house objects of such value. People say, bring them first then we will fix them, the same way we jumped into the oil industry without developing or agric industry-
3472 2018-12-05 18:52:34 Bladders for oil tankers!
3473 2018-12-05 18:52:29 U see the motor oil on the bottom shelf on the left??? Lmfaoo
3474 2018-12-05 18:52:27 Finally getting my oil changed. It may be 12,192 miles past when I should’ve gotten it changed, but I mean oh well
3475 2018-12-05 18:52:09 As for the oil industry -- they always hedge their bets.  They are capable of seeing who has political momentum and appeal.  I trust O'Rourke more than almost any Republican to prioritize people over oil industry interests.
3476 2018-12-05 18:52:08 Drill baby drill. Mexico's Lopez Obrador throws down gauntlet to oil majors - pump, or there will be no more oil fields up for grabs. He wasn't entirely clear that there would be fields up for grabs even if they do what he asks, of course.

3479 2018-12-05 18:51:51 Its the failure of Justin Trudeau and his own Anti pipeline agenda that has lead of oil crisis. Guess what , if he loses next election, it won’t be Butts who lost but Justin Trudeau.
3480 2018-12-05 18:51:51 Is it oil Mia? Don’t forget Tellus please
3481 2018-12-05 18:51:44 Until you look at the track history of predictions.

3482 2018-12-05 18:51:41 what i'd like to know is if them ago beat the meat wit all dem barrels of missing oil
3483 2018-12-05 18:51:23 Why are we still looking for oil
Burning fuel to make power is out of date now. Power storage for green energy or massive amounts of pollution in air
Why have so many fail to change
No incentive to change
3484 2018-12-05 18:51:17 Lol Omo mola ni mi but ibile
3485 2018-12-05 18:51:15 Hopefully you develop an energy strategy that puts our national defense and interests first and start laying the groundwork to get off oil and out of being tied to OPEC whims.  MAGA right?  I know you don’t believe that either. More like MMRA - Make Me Rich America.
3486 2018-12-05 18:51:13 欲張りだなぁ
3487 2018-12-05 18:51:13 What can we really do to him? He has all the oil, so the cards are stacked in his favor. I'd rather not deal with any of them in Middle East, but we have no choice unless you're willing to stop driving.
3488 2018-12-05 18:51:05 Yes you're right but we have to be responsible at the same time.

He just told me what you did to him

3492 2018-12-05 18:50:49 Yes, I agree. But I think it will take quite some time to get there. There is an incredible reliance on oil and gas now, it will be challenging to change that. And develop alternative energy sources besides solar and wind. It's going to take some smart scientists...

3494 2018-12-05 18:50:41 I thought we had our own oil and didn’t need there’s so what they do or don’t do shouldn’t affect us right?
3495 2018-12-05 18:50:40 Please don't forget to bring a canned food item or other nonperishable food item when you come for your oil change between now and 12/14/18. You get a discounted oil change for donating to the Hallsville Outreach Center food drive.

3499 2018-12-05 18:50:31 Carbon tax is gang rape.
3500 2018-12-05 18:50:24 WAIT. Are those radiators under the windows? 

"Put up some curtains, do you think we own stock in the oil company?!"
3501 2018-12-05 18:50:22 Ya, go with that idea Corey....go build your solar powered shed in the forest, riding your 10 speed.
You may not like the fact that the world DOES need oil, but producers are continually making efficiency improvements and the need will continue for at least another 30 yrs.
3502 2018-12-05 18:50:19 Saudi Arabia and Russia set to defy President Trump with an agreement to cutback on supply, in order to prop up oil prices.
3503 2018-12-05 18:50:15 Sitting in the middle of Quick Lane getting my oil changed and crying my eyes out. So touching.
3504 2018-12-05 18:49:58 The ideas are flowing like oil off a latke.
3505 2018-12-05 18:49:50 can you buy me some oil for my car, it’s like 7$ at autozone
3506 2018-12-05 18:49:45 Ameen ya rabbi 
3507 2018-12-05 18:49:32 ああああああああぁぁぁ…おなかもおっぱいもおしりもちんぽも全部ほしいいいっっっ！！！！！！！
3508 2018-12-05 18:49:31 If there were true justice in this world, a gigantic ACME anvil would immediately fall from the sky on anyone who uses the word "intersectional."
3509 2018-12-05 18:49:16 Went out to buy parsley, heavy cream, and a (single, solitary) shallot. Came back with all of the above, plus a large bottle of good olive oil, double dark chocolate Milanos, assorted other snacks and produce, and a brand new immersion blender.* When did I become this person.
3510 2018-12-05 18:49:03 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
3511 2018-12-05 18:48:54 Of course, an insurance agent is Christ-like compared to Gus Malzahn, who sells an even more venomous snake oil for tens of millions of dollars
3512 2018-12-05 18:48:53 I think I was forced to take some in capsule form at some point, but never just straight oil. Sounds gross.
3513 2018-12-05 18:48:45 Who was in charge of the United States government when the Russians tried to meddle in 2016 election? 

Cut it out! 

Who annihilated 300 Russians on the battlefield this year?

Who enforced Obama's Redline?

Who didn't enforce his own Redline?

Who produced more oil than Putin?
3514 2018-12-05 18:48:40 Extra virgin olive oil is my favorite because it's so good for your skin!! #bathday #joyfulbathco #giftbasket
3515 2018-12-05 18:48:40 “I don’t want to be super rich, just rich enough to change the oil in my car on time” 
3516 2018-12-05 18:48:39 It tastes bomb w some olive oil
3517 2018-12-05 18:48:39 Sex with baby oil be a thouwow doe
3518 2018-12-05 18:48:38 Cheers Paul. Hopefully another 3pts to keep up with the dodgy oil bribers. 
Enjoy the game all.
3519 2018-12-05 18:48:37 The man knows that for Mexico to become economically viable that Pemex must increase offshore oil drilling and production.
3520 2018-12-05 18:48:30 Government are literally pushing through another £24bn+ tax breaks for North Sea oil & gas companies right now, via a Finance Bill, in order to incentivise ‘Maximum Economic Recovery’ AKA ‘extract every last drop’
3521 2018-12-05 18:48:28 Bumble & bumble - invisible oil. O new wash de hairstory.
3522 2018-12-05 18:48:26 smelling rosemary essential oil & taking brahmi powder (internal) are supposed to be good.
3523 2018-12-05 18:48:21 people use make up and filters but y'all wailing about some cardboard and motor oil? It's all art and advertisement yo 
3524 2018-12-05 18:48:09 No they don't. They still think Dems r holding US oil cos back and we need more drilling. Our oil production has been increasing for yrs & we r not dependent on the Saudis. This, by the way, had nothing 2 do with Trump, US production has been increasing steadily 4 past 15 yrs.
3525 2018-12-05 18:48:02 massage my scalp with coconut oil, I need some TLC.
3526 2018-12-05 18:47:55 I keep saying this. If you follow YouTube and IG videos you'll throw money away. Now I know what works best for my hair. Coconut oil, water, and my special growth oil.
3527 2018-12-05 18:47:55 I just read that frankincense essential oil can be “used” for depression and now I’m wondering if little baby Jesus was really going through it
3528 2018-12-05 18:47:52 And you further realize we DON'T subsidize OIL from OPEC right?
But the OIL subsidies are around $4.5 Billion Collected Back in TAX. 
Also, that renewables are subsidized at around $29 Billion to $38 Billion with NO TAX return on investment.
3529 2018-12-05 18:47:47 Imagine I just unplaited, washed and applied coconut oil. Thank you
3530 2018-12-05 18:47:32 Today's special lunch slice is The Riverside: Thin crust, olive oil, applewood smoked bacon, onions, parmigiana reggiano! #DinosForLunch #pizza
3531 2018-12-05 18:47:32 HIS SON KILLED MILLIONS IN IRAK BECAUSE OF CHEAP OIL, WHERE ARE THE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION WEAPONS? FROM BUSH FATHER SPERM WAS BORN THIS DRUNK MONSTER
3532 2018-12-05 18:47:31 You don't think the oil companies would be interested in funding research that shows burning fossil fuels is no problem?
3533 2018-12-05 18:47:24 I agree with you. Macam chef Wan cakap dalam slot cooking dia. (lupa tajuk ape ) our palm oil is the best to use for cooking, frying etc.
3534 2018-12-05 18:47:23 Bad day. Left early, came home, burned sage, powered up my oil diffuser and salt lamp, got out my crystals. I’m that bitch.
3535 2018-12-05 18:47:13 Ori'e ti gbale oo, mo robi omo mallam ni'e ni.
3536 2018-12-05 18:47:12 I use natural unscented laundry detergent and add in some lavender essential oil so it smells nice just a tip 
3537 2018-12-05 18:47:01 If Saudi Arabia isn’t in the world Trust me All the World we’ll be very Weak  

Saudi Arabia is now controlled oil company . If Saudi Arabia  price rose up.  All the world will become poor
3538 2018-12-05 18:46:59 Correct. In the post world war 2 era the US had surplus oil to export and all of the high tech industrial capital left standing since no one bombed US territory. The only way we can make America great is create a supply of primary energy at a competitive cost on a scale we export
3539 2018-12-05 18:46:57 Girl, change your oil
3540 2018-12-05 18:46:57 That is a great question, spent 34 years on the NYSE,  crash of 87, 89, dot com, oil embargo in the 70’s . And always the shit eating grin, from some staffer, from the exchange, ringing the bell, as I, and my fellow members, were numbed by the days events
3541 2018-12-05 18:46:53 Retrofitting current fleet for natgas is insane given costs - I've seen more interest in scrubbers than in natgas for existing fleet. They'll either switch to marine diesel or take low sulfur fuel oil starting in 2020 with  IMO guidelines kicking in. Maybe newbuilds will be ntgas
3542 2018-12-05 18:46:50 Won't halt the effects of climate change. International Energy Agency states, energy demand in next two decades will double in India. China will continue to be the biggest consumer of oil, ensuring global C02 emissions continue to rise regardless of European & US measures.
3543 2018-12-05 18:46:48 This is AWESOME!!!! 

300mg oil
5 ct. Gummies sleep
Max shot
100mg syrup
125mg vape tank

@DinaBerrett3 @SJS_Survivor @Drraggonman @Macheon7
3544 2018-12-05 18:46:48 Our CDN politicians are also willfully blind by not banning the importation of Saudi oil.
3545 2018-12-05 18:46:45 お腹ならあるよ？
3546 2018-12-05 18:46:35 Actually Donald, the world does need higher oil prices because that is what stimulates the understanding that fossil fuels are not sustainable. 

Some big words in here so I’ll give time to understand this tweet.
3547 2018-12-05 18:46:30 surely they are closed circuit hydraulic systems so shouldnt run out of hydraulic oil.. unless they had a leak that is
3548 2018-12-05 18:46:26 Everyone knows these cuts are symbolic. They never actually cut production. It’s all about selling and producing as much as possible.  Oil should be $40 or lower since the US has more oil in storage than ever and is producing more than ever.
3549 2018-12-05 18:46:24 Look, I’m not saying you should get married just so someone can get your oil changed for you but is a bonus.
3550 2018-12-05 18:46:21 We'll never find out either......The Swamp ws at its fullest during the Bush years. They are "Oil Elitists" that all the movies are about. Jeb is a total embarrassment.....sp?....
3551 2018-12-05 18:46:19 get an oil change today
3552 2018-12-05 18:46:03 Setting a few things straight:
-Tar sands are not tar, they are heavy oil
-They’re no dirtier than any other oil
-Canada's oil sands are only a bit more energy intensive than other heavy oil deposits
-We know exactly how much emissions oil sands produce #oilandgas #sustainability
3553 2018-12-05 18:45:56 Ironic how they Ransom the whole world by their oil, and everybody just praises their wrong doings and applauses them.
3554 2018-12-05 18:45:53 It started with high taxes on oil they said they’ll postpone the tax for 6 months now they got blood and they’re going to keep protesting against the government
3555 2018-12-05 18:45:40 The riot are from people NOT wanting GAS tax to cover the “Climant Control” crap that France and the EU have to endure since @realDonaldTrump took the U.S. out and the U.S. DOLLARS to be paid came with it! Paris $7 gal. With oil at $56 a barrel is the problem
3556 2018-12-05 18:45:40 We need to overlook his taking money from Wall St and the oil/military complex. He's our best chance to win yet another popular vote contest 
3557 2018-12-05 18:45:39 I haven’t gotten my oil changed in 12,000 miles. i’m surprised kiki is still going.
3558 2018-12-05 18:45:35 Just sat in my kitchen for half an hour wondering why the oil in the pan wasn’t warming up and why the pan handle was burning, little did I know I switched the wrong hob on it’s been a long day
3559 2018-12-05 18:45:30 The world doesn't need oil! Now where's my jet?
3560 2018-12-05 18:45:25 はらへった………たべものかちんぽほしい…………
3561 2018-12-05 18:45:23 More oil more pollution. More climate change. More natural distruction. Oil is like coal. Obsolete.
3562 2018-12-05 18:45:19 Are they going to wipe the dust off the petroleum exhibit from the 1939 world fair because we kind of figured out ways to use oil
3563 2018-12-05 18:45:17 Free oil change + $110 tire alignment = a very upset Cam
3564 2018-12-05 18:45:11 Go ahead and blame the oil industry but the reason the Paris accord will not be achieved is because the people are not convinced the actions of leaders in their respective countries are doing the right thing.Voters are pushing back and the politicians are folding like cheap tents
3565 2018-12-05 18:45:03 I'm sure oil producers in the US want to see higher oil prices and the people who work in that industry, but that's complicated and you're a simple boy.
3566 2018-12-05 18:44:53 Saudi break even is ~$10 because their oil reserves are in large pools close to the surface where it is easy/cheap to pump out. U.S. oil reserves are Shale meaning its trapped in rock formations deep underground. The cost of those two processes will never be equivalent.
3567 2018-12-05 18:44:39 Nice false dichotomy there bud. Whatever helps you ease that dissonance. 

See, we will always need oil. 

However, we don't need to use quite so much of it, nor do we need to subsidize and industry that separates oil from fucking sand. 

Renewables = future 
Pipelines = past
3568 2018-12-05 18:44:36 No blood for oil.  That was my first real protest as well.
3569 2018-12-05 18:44:24 Read the tweet again and thank me later
3570 2018-12-05 18:44:23 Until we start laying off people in our oil producing industry because prices are too low.  Going to borrow money from China to subsidize them too?
3571 2018-12-05 18:44:19 He’s smelling a recently fired gun in your waistband and know that good guys use a holster and also smell like oil, not powder

#BackTheBlue
3572 2018-12-05 18:44:19 And you are the same people that believe Obama when he says that it was him that fixed the economy. You also believed him when he said the manufacturing jobs aren’t going to come back to America You lefties just cannot win Almost like your water and winning is oil
3573 2018-12-05 18:44:12 Loaded up with my man size tissues and olbas oil don’t give a shit if it’s politically correct iv got a stinking cold that bad it must be a man one 
3574 2018-12-05 18:44:08 oil, #mobydick #onewordatatime ⏅~~⏅⏅⏅⏅⏅⏅~⏅⏅~~~~
3575 2018-12-05 18:44:03 You're talking like a New Yorker! You forgot about all the red states for which oil is a significant part of the economy, e.g., Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Wyoming, North Dakota & Alaska.
3576 2018-12-05 18:44:00 The lantern is running out of oil we must burn the bread.
3577 2018-12-05 18:43:57 If he: 
-cooks supper when you work late 
-does the laundry after you come in from a locums asgmt 
-changes the oil in your car 
-doesn’t call parenting ‘babysitting’ 
-still rocks your world 20yrs later 
Yes ma’am #husbandbrag #thisonesmineyall 
3578 2018-12-05 18:43:55 Don't produce more oil; price carbon; other collective actions: Much higher impact than any of these individual actions.
3579 2018-12-05 18:43:53 Didn't start imperialist oil wars on Halliburtom's behalf, didn't overthrow Latin American governments, didn't put a rapey Monsanto shill on the Supreme Court for life.
3580 2018-12-05 18:43:49 بس كمان يمدحوا E oil للهالات مدري ايش افضل زيت جنين القمح ولا دا كيف اختك استخدمته بس الزيت لوحده كل يوم قبل النوم؟
3581 2018-12-05 18:43:39 1. That is inaccurate. Renewables are already cheaper in many parts of the country and are only becoming exponentially quicker over time. The only thing holding them back as of now is energy storage.
2. We only get 10% of our oil from OPEC.
3582 2018-12-05 18:43:39 the smell of oil paint and stale ideas are my favourite things in the world. 

forget talking dirty, talk about antiquated art criticisms with me
3583 2018-12-05 18:43:33 Corporations can eventually be broken up, just as was done with Standard Oil.
But these Traitor voters losing their shirts? Beautiful. Let 'em beg their precious Hannity and Limbaugh for food.
3584 2018-12-05 18:43:31 If you didn’t draw that conclusion from what he’s said so far, I’m sorry you’ve fallen for a snake oil selling false prophet. But it’s not my job to fix you. I don’t really care.
3585 2018-12-05 18:43:28 @JoeFortesVan Hi there!  Just a quick question... I have an unopened bottle of lobster oil I was given at the end of April and was saving until the Holidays to use.  I thought I better check on whether it's still good or not though!  Thanks so much!
3586 2018-12-05 18:43:20 We r not at the mercy of Saudi Arabia. US is number one oil producer in the world (look it up). People have totally wrong impression of our oil industry. We need alternative energy, not because we r dependent but because of environmental pollution. We don't need more production.
3587 2018-12-05 18:43:16 My man is the sexiest when he gets home in his oil stained work shirt and hands. Hair all a mess and my god I could go on  love my hard working man
3588 2018-12-05 18:43:12 Lol ibile lawa, aa fese rin d'ekó orì lawa gbé wole
3589 2018-12-05 18:42:55 The thing is, the U.S. is in a much better position to keep domestic oil prices lower than we were in the past. Additionally, if Saudis are involved in this, coupled with Graham's recent remarks, the "Prince" will probably soon be toast. You can quote me on that. Fundamentals! 
3590 2018-12-05 18:42:49 Wow the oil money
3591 2018-12-05 18:42:39 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3592 2018-12-05 18:42:38 いいね
3593 2018-12-05 18:42:32 Dépenses, retraites, @realDonaldTrump, oil, finances, recettes.
3594 2018-12-05 18:42:24 Forgot to bring hand lotion to work so I used sesame oil..
3595 2018-12-05 18:42:22 ポテチ自分から欲してきたのに、もう消えたんだけど…
3596 2018-12-05 18:42:18 we produce more oil than we can use. we don't need them
3597 2018-12-05 18:42:12 Wlhy some friends are better than family... I have my reasons tbh
3598 2018-12-05 18:42:08 I am having this problem too.  Art prints from artists you like can be good.  Extra points if it’s framed and ready to hang.  Otherwise... excellent coffee/tea/booze/olive oil/cheese/other high cost consumables? Technical gear? Yeah totally in the same boat.
3599 2018-12-05 18:42:07 Aaatoh koya kagani
3600 2018-12-05 18:42:03 @RepDavidYoung @ChuckGrassley @SenJoniErnst: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
3601 2018-12-05 18:41:57 Why couldn't the grocer get to work? His car had an oil leek.
3602 2018-12-05 18:41:55 They have Saturday service at Toyota Plaza, you just go in and get an oil change while you wait. I was in last Saturday with my truck, took about an hour and it was done.
3603 2018-12-05 18:41:44 Not that far away.  You missed a whole series of tweets taking credit for low oil prices now that economy has tanked.  Agree on the fed that’s pretty obvious.  Producers globally are tired of fueling this bs fang economy.  No one’s investing in oil get used to high prices.
3604 2018-12-05 18:41:37 IDGAF if these women were talking about having raging Wesson oil furniture breaking sex...it is none of that bitch's damn business. I pray I am never within earshot of something like this because I'm gonna need bail money.
3605 2018-12-05 18:41:22 "George W. Bush" I am thankful the Bush Dynasty is over. Fake news CNN saying his administration was kinder and gentler. BS! Blood for oil wars, no health insurance safety net for the unemployed, outsourcing of American jobs to create a wage slave service economy. No thanks!
3606 2018-12-05 18:41:17 How about right now? If you think of global warming, the never ending flow of migrants and refugees, the upcoming wars for scarce resources like oil and water, the dissolution of the social safety net and growing authoritarianism around the world.

The future is likely to be shit
3607 2018-12-05 18:41:10 Innalillahi wa inna ilayhi rajiun, may her gentle soul continue to rest in peace, forgive her shortcomings & may Allah make her grave a pathway to jannah.
3608 2018-12-05 18:41:09 Not as impassioned as Ronald Reagan's was.....The Bush Clan is from among the 'elite'  and 'Oil Dynasty' in this country... and behind the scene has been part of the Swamp. Bush Sr. is probably the most dignified of the whole clan....Virtue is not hereditary.
3609 2018-12-05 18:41:06 It all goes back to his original plot to take over California, which thought should start in Richmond, home of Standard Oil. Jovanka was one of the Berniecrats installed on Richmond city council.
3610 2018-12-05 18:41:06 People should understand that natural gas, methane, consisting of carbon and hydrogen, burns to carbon dioxide and water, H2O. The same is true for coal, and oil, primarily hydrocarbons; They all burn to carbon dioxide and water. Got it?
3611 2018-12-05 18:41:06 But all companies sourcing palm oil cannot be tarred with the same brush. Those ethically sourcing it are providing the world with a fantastic product.
3612 2018-12-05 18:41:04 I’m dead ass wrong for riding around and haven’t had an oil change since August .
3613 2018-12-05 18:41:00 Procrastinator.

Someone: I'll run over there and bang on that oil drum. When they go for me, you run up behind and kill them.
Me: ok
S: right - go!
Me:
Me:
S: what the -? Where are you?
Me: hang on a minute
S: aaaah! AAAAAAH!
Me: just a sec - just need to do this...
3614 2018-12-05 18:40:55 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
3615 2018-12-05 18:40:55 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3616 2018-12-05 18:40:54 Regardless of whether you think it was about oil, it was a sovereign nation that was invaded and we did the right thing.
3617 2018-12-05 18:40:51 I disagree.   One way to reduce "polluters" you referred to in another tweet is to maintain Well Priced Oil above $60/barrel .   I also believe the US has a lot of jobs depending on healthy oil prices !     Let's be consistent POTUS
3618 2018-12-05 18:40:50 That being said, I researched & you’re right. Obama’s environmental record on oil was better then I thought. There was a decrease, party due to more red tape that he created, and partly due to natural becoming so cheap
3619 2018-12-05 18:40:48 There's a spot on my screen, it's faint but I see it everytime I'm at my computer. A part of my screen is damaged, hot oil singed through it. How you ask? Eating dan dan noodles at my desk. I don't regret it. It was a delicious mistake, it will forever remind me of that flavor.
3620 2018-12-05 18:40:34 Just because I disapprove of Trumps, doesn't make me a Democrat. I have 2 yrs to change the minds of people that have been brainwashed by a snake oil salesman & his criminal family. Say it a lot, don't like my thoughts, simple, ignore them & read what pleases you, stay blind.
3621 2018-12-05 18:40:28 That’s good, but don’t bet on it lasting. Saudi oil is cheaper to extract and it’s OPEC that determines how much they produce, not practical restrictions.
@rowdyh1 has a good idea. Becoming self-sufficient in energy, if you can do it, is a good move geopolitically & economically.
3622 2018-12-05 18:40:26 Never forget Dame Dash has his own motor oil.
3623 2018-12-05 18:40:24 “it’s actual dead oily n that cause it’s oil”
3624 2018-12-05 18:40:24 If Italian lawyer get Visa
At the most, they will guide to Indian lawyers, but no arguments allowed in court
As far as Dubai is concerned, they don't have anything original, except Oil and Gold, everything things is foreign, mostly.
Every nation has rules
Indian institution beat
3625 2018-12-05 18:40:23 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
3626 2018-12-05 18:40:16 You realize OPEC, is an intergovernmental organization of 15 nations founded to control (fix) OIL prices & control 44 percent of global oil production & 81.5 percent of the world's "proven" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices.
3627 2018-12-05 18:40:08  they'd of been in another illegal war by now over oil

3632 2018-12-05 18:39:49 Came to get my oil changed and this lady said 3 hours .. bro what
3633 2018-12-05 18:39:49 Thank you bro, you know as adults we must agree to disagree
3634 2018-12-05 18:39:47 I went and got waxed yesterday and the lady masked my legs in some shea butter other solid oil casing.

GIRLAH. my legs are still moistured
3635 2018-12-05 18:39:45 This is not the beginning of the solution, this is not the begging of stability but it is perhaps the ending of the acceleration. And that’s all that’s been achieved because electricity has not replaced oil as the basis of future growth. I love Hillary.
3636 2018-12-05 18:39:43 There's a joke in there somewhere about oil and Channing Tatum.
3637 2018-12-05 18:39:42 @HoustonMatters Your commenter is full of *expletive deleted*. The offshore oil and gas industry, a huge employer in Houston, is in the toilet.
3638 2018-12-05 18:39:37 Imran Bhai that’s a big big news. Why the Government isn’t investing more here to explore more availability of Oil here. This can be a Game Changer for our Country.
3639 2018-12-05 18:39:36 I had to leave my car at the dealership this morning to get an oil change/tire rotation and I’m like— DON’T YOU DARE HURT MY BABY.
3640 2018-12-05 18:39:30 It's probably worth noting (since I didn't in the story) that Stuller is the 7th-largest employer in Lafayette Parish. It's also the only manufacturer that ranks in the top 10 in assessed property value (6th) -- ahead of Wal-Mart and Shell Oil, behind SLEMCO and Halliburton

3642 2018-12-05 18:39:16 I have combo. There’s a primer I use to control oil in the t-zone and with that as well as a powder that goes over it I’m fine all day.
3643 2018-12-05 18:39:15 Heard Phlash Phelps on "Sirius 60s on 6" this morning give a shout-out to the Shale workers of America who have helped make America the #1 oil producer in the entire world! God bless those guys and our POTUS who has given them the "go ahead" to do their thing!
3644 2018-12-05 18:39:14 Not for long as Alaska is broke from low oil prices and we have been talking income and sales taxes

3654 2018-12-05 18:38:31 Sometimes, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. Sometimes, it gets replaced. Just a thought.
3655 2018-12-05 18:38:22 Half the people I hand my oil pen acted like they knew what they were doing, and didn’t. They’re about to ruin it for everyone
3656 2018-12-05 18:38:20 Sorry but that is not true either. Only two countries tried to exchange oil with other currencies Russia and China but the Russians kept manipulating the value of the oil and the Chinese kept manipulating their monetary policy so it failed badly.
3657 2018-12-05 18:38:14 Rachel has done nothing for oil&gas. She's trying to save her job now
3658 2018-12-05 18:38:13 If OPEC and its allies led by Russia agree to reduce oil output next year by reverting to 2016 production quotas, it would imply an OPEC-only supply curb of at least 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), according to Reuters calculations.

But... what happened was...

It smells so strong it just masks the must but of course it would because one drop smells loud enough to drown out a plane taking off.
3667 2018-12-05 18:37:43 Who is the cooking oil guy? 
3668 2018-12-05 18:37:41 Oil prices inched higher on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the world's biggest exporters who will discuss cutting output to help shore up prices and curb excess supply.
3669 2018-12-05 18:37:19 You know the “low prices” are killing the domestic oil industry that was giving us greater independence
3670 2018-12-05 18:37:15 At 35,000 ltrs/ truck that's equivalent to 658 trucks of oil. And one truck accident in Kenya is normally a national disaster with memorials.
3671 2018-12-05 18:37:08 We know we’re dependent on opec oil, we know we can get off of oil by moving towards renewable, we know we want to, and we know we should - but I’d rather hope for something I can’t control. Makes sense

3679 2018-12-05 18:36:38 There should be. But it’ll need to be, in the most part, secret. We also need to send our clever brain boxes as otherwise we’ll end up sending the usual thrusters who’ll just buy all the snake oil & inappropriate shiny trinkets sold by the contractors.

3694 2018-12-05 18:35:44 WTI didn't react to Trump's last oil tweet either. They know he's no longer effective at moving price.
3695 2018-12-05 18:35:43 The first thing that comes to my mind when I read what "the world does not want, or need" is certainly not high oil prices! Definitly not!
3696 2018-12-05 18:35:42 Harrumph.  Too many Oil&Gas interests for my taste.
3697 2018-12-05 18:35:36 Merci beaucoup pour ce thread très intéressant ! Cependant, sur la Grand-Goule, ne serait-il pas plus simple d'expliquer sont nom par le mot "goule", forme que prend dans les langues d'oïl de l'ouest le latin gŭla ?
3698 2018-12-05 18:35:30 He's not absorbing any of this. He probably thinks 41 was weak and low energy, and dumb for not taking Iraq's oil fields during Desert Storm. Unless he's pondering Mueller's sentencing memo on General Flynn.
3699 2018-12-05 18:35:25 Yeah, it was great him recognising that the second temple in Jerusalem was ransacked by the Greek/Syrian occupying forces, but that the authentic host community prevailed in a miracle of the oil. Unbelievable that the Jews could have been there 2,500 years ago!
3700 2018-12-05 18:35:13 US is the NUMBER ONE producer of oil in the world as of 2017. We have been climbing in oil production 4 the last 15 yrs, nothing 2 do with Trump. Most people don't even know that, they still buy the "drill baby drill" mentality like govt & Dems were restricting oil cos.
3701 2018-12-05 18:35:09 Aye. rUK will certainly not want any of our beef, fish, whisky, gin, oil, gas or electricity.
3702 2018-12-05 18:35:03 Get ready.  It's going to be a long slog to 2020.
3703 2018-12-05 18:34:55 vitamin-e oil is my skins savior
3704 2018-12-05 18:34:52 The US now produces more oil than  any other country, this was made to happen so we would not be beholden to OPEC and the gas crisis of the late 70’s...
3705 2018-12-05 18:34:46 The World does not want to see, or need to see, a lot of things.

For example, the World is stuck with you.

Oil prices are the least of our worries.
3706 2018-12-05 18:34:44 I’m that girl who needs to here this ! Sus your check engine light on. Get a oil change 
3707 2018-12-05 18:34:41 all things work together. and that also includes oil. what part of that don't you understand?
3708 2018-12-05 18:34:40 Socialism exists on a scale. Medicare is a socialist policy. If you work, you are generally required to pay in. Do you think Medicare helps contribute to violence?

3710 2018-12-05 18:34:38 Oil companies do not like Saudis flooding the market. Look at their stocks if this continues???????
3711 2018-12-05 18:34:35 Now that's worth some hot oil.....and hands caressing you all over until you tingle deep inside girl.....
3712 2018-12-05 18:34:35 Orrrrrrr... You could be forward thinking and encourage less dependency on oil altogether. Why would you continue to hang onto dead technology? Completely rethink your entire position and make America great by fostering real change by leading in energy sector innovation.

3723 2018-12-05 18:33:48 Worldwide subsidies for fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) amounts to 5.3 trillion dollars — per year (the number is for 2015).

Colts still have a marching band. Much less heralded than Baltimore. They walk the concourse of Lucas Oil every pregame. There is also a live band playing at main entrance inside stadium. I don't pay attention to either.
3731 2018-12-05 18:33:18 The fracking is another point of interest. Where will your oil soaked pockets live then. The earth will crack and no where to go! Your money will be dust.
3732 2018-12-05 18:33:16 Worry about the stock market not oil prices. Hopefully when we get a more futuristic president fossil fuel will be a thing of the past.

3735 2018-12-05 18:33:06 isn’t it cool how everyone forgot how Bush 41 was a serial groper and started a needless oil war that has cost trillions of dollars and thousands of lives?
3736 2018-12-05 18:33:03 1970s was an era of rising prices, rising unemployment; periods of poor economic growth could be explained as result of cost push inflation of high oil prices, but stagflation was unexplainable according to Keynesian economic theory.

3739 2018-12-05 18:32:43 Sort of: the USA are nowadays an oil exporting country.

3743 2018-12-05 18:32:27 These terms are well defined. It's the left that redefines them to confound ppl and sanitize them. Illegal aliens are not immigrants, there are 2 genders and socialism as a political system is what it is. Renaming/ rebranding doesn't change it's true nature

3757 2018-12-05 18:31:08 He died for money in oil and gold paid in innocent blood. It covers the hands of all who funded the terrorists that destroyed Libya. It wasn't just money they were after though but they also opposed Gadaffi because he opposed Israeli imperialism, he then became a victim of it.

3762 2018-12-05 18:30:54 Trump, is correct. 
In your zeal to hate on our duly elected President, you neglected to point out the fact that regulations put in place by Obama were preventing the production of OIL, creating false scarcity.
3763 2018-12-05 18:30:49 I just wanted my oil changed and headlight fixed not a whole new car

3765 2018-12-05 18:30:39 Not to be sold on television. It's false advertising to market a product that doesn't work as claimed. FCC has standards believe it or not. THe loop hole these snake oil salesman operate on is that they don't say send me $19.95 for your salvation. but clearly that's the deal
3766 2018-12-05 18:30:34 Have you ever tried CBD oil? There’s no THC in it so you don’t get high, it has calming properties. I took some before the gym and I felt a lot better

3768 2018-12-05 18:30:28 I disagree with his assertion that we should still be using the pre-industrial, renewable, non-fossil fuel favored at the time.

But if he wants to start burning whale oil again, I'll at least hear him out.

3772 2018-12-05 18:30:23 So you think bringing back what happened in the past will solve issues? You don't get along and fortunately for you you are blocked from seeing his activities. Meye amfanin sticking to old fights. Not even him, ko ni na tuna me kayi masa.
3773 2018-12-05 18:30:16 Hahahahah... What about us... Since u have burt ur midnite oil...hahahah
3774 2018-12-05 18:30:14 Problem approaching for #Permian field is infrastructure for shipping oil out, as Alberta is having to drop production due to pipeline issues. USA virtually self-sufficient!
3775 2018-12-05 18:30:12 THE SCENE: i am throwing a tantrum in a Chipotlé

THE CAST OF CHARACTERS: a good christian, an anti-vaccine activist, an essential oil person

THE GOOD CHRISTIAN: that man needs The Lord

THE ESSENTIAL OIL PERSON: if that guy smelled some peppermint he'd be okay

AVA: he's fucked
3776 2018-12-05 18:30:11 That sort of arbitrage is possible but not likely to last long. Either Brent would drop or Middle East would ship. In fact China has been authorized to buy Iranian oil. And given the sanctions, that will likely be cheaper.
3777 2018-12-05 18:30:08 Getting oil change
3778 2018-12-05 18:30:06 The linseed oil that catches fire is the hardcore “raw” or “boiled” linseed oil you would get at a home improvement store. I’ve had rags soaked with refined linseed oil and nothing ever happened. And they were only soaked because of a cleanup I had to do...
3779 2018-12-05 18:30:02 Yes! Thanks! I actually introduced that to both our kitties a few months ago and Moo started showing signs of being a kitten again! It also calms down Loki's anxiety. Both have been so happy and playful since taking CBD oil! That's great it helps with epilepsy too! Wow!
3780 2018-12-05 18:29:58 No, you’re confusing the signifier with the signified. Gold is value dense because of its natural scarcity. It’s simply harder and therefore more costly to extract from earth than say corn, oil, or an apple. That self evident truth used to be better understood by avg person.
3781 2018-12-05 18:29:55 We all are fighting cancer , the reason is the oil which we use are all adulterated oils. if Government take interest in Cold pressed Coconut oil in large scale , and we can ban all the oils which are causing cancer. the logic is simple undigested oil causes cancer.
3782 2018-12-05 18:29:52 So your guest, admittedly not “...an expert...” (guessing here) neither in climate science nor economics, giving assertions re the reduction of CO2 emissions and oil output not working, seem to fly in the face of those experts that can prove that they do, not?
3783 2018-12-05 18:29:52 @askslim Been one heck of a ride with Light Sweet Crude Oil futures. Ranges you talked about on Future Speak & Market Week have held up nicely so far this week. Ameritrade raised the margin req on the e-mini /QM, but still one of the lowest around, very nice!
3784 2018-12-05 18:29:51 - Al Gore being wrong on one aspect doesn't make climate change as whole unreal.
- Climate denier will point out how the details of the climate science aren't sure while ignoring this is how all science is done
3785 2018-12-05 18:29:48 It's a managed float. With oil prices dropping and the US$ strength coming off the boil I can't see the CBK letting the KES move much in the short term.
3786 2018-12-05 18:29:45 Remember how many people lauding George Bush today called him Wussy Skull & Bones Oil Barron Hitler.

3788 2018-12-05 18:29:38 We are no longer dependent on Saudi Oil.  You should remind them.  And go after the Prince.  But then again, you always put yourself above country.
3789 2018-12-05 18:29:20 Coconut Oil does ABSOLUTELY nothing for my hair and skin. Regardless of if it’s pure coconut oil or products that include it .
3790 2018-12-05 18:29:10 I suspect I would have left my husband if he had voted leave (and both of us are Brits) but then again, if he were the sort of person who trusted snake oil salesmen like Farage & JRM, I wouldn’t have married him in the first place.
3791 2018-12-05 18:29:06 I want to see higher oil prices.
3792 2018-12-05 18:28:55 No news this AM.  CBC & CTV  ran the entire send off for a person who wasn't a Canadian. I never trusted the Bush family. Like Trump seem too close to the Saudi  Royal family & other Middle Eastern oil rich countries.  In fact wasn't that what Iraq & Kuwait wars were about ?

3794 2018-12-05 18:28:49 We don’t get pool from OPEC and the world is till getting the sweetest oil on earth, from Iran.
3795 2018-12-05 18:28:44 Of course they do. My complaint about this entire article is that he made it out to be “big oil” sneaking around the PAC issue, when in reality it’s regular workers in the largest industry in the state. This isn’t a partisan thing.
3796 2018-12-05 18:28:38 I better go get this oil changed 
3797 2018-12-05 18:28:33 For an Albertan oil worker, it is definitely a crisis. However, @RachelNotley and her predecessors try to deflect any responsibility for the boom-and-bust economy they created, exactly as Peter Lougheed warned and sought to prevent. No sales tax for the good times and big trucks.
3798 2018-12-05 18:28:32 It is just possible that most of your base is too stupid to see behind that oil flow BS, MAGAMAN, but some of them may. Get off it. You have to decide who is going to wear the dog collar. You or the Saudi royal family. It's beginning to look good on you.
3799 2018-12-05 18:28:25 Our Annual Open House is just a few hours away. We will have some great specials tonight and we're also debuting our new Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar flavours from @DellaTerraLtd
3800 2018-12-05 18:28:22 In 1970, you could buy 1.75 barrels of oil with 1oz of gold.  In 1980, you could buy 6.67 barrels of oil with an oz of gold. The relative value of gold to other asset classes is constantly in flux. DOW ratio an extreme example.
3801 2018-12-05 18:28:21 I hope fusion makes massive progress.  Oddly enough the current President might be a decent hope as he does not seem at all tied to the oil companies. I know many can’t stand this but he does seem to like putting his finger in the eye of established interests.
3802 2018-12-05 18:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
3803 2018-12-05 18:28:17 Vitamin e oil has my skin too right 
3804 2018-12-05 18:28:14 Turbos passing oil into inlet manifold, engines running on its own oil not fuel
3805 2018-12-05 18:28:14 Coconut oil and  vagisil
3806 2018-12-05 18:28:08 Every oil does not work in your engine! Be wise! Be humble!

3808 2018-12-05 18:28:05 There is a lot about oil & money that seems to be illogical & incongruous.
But
Big Oil has made Big Money during Bush & Obama administrations
In fact, (while Obama was president) from 2011 to 2016 oil has proved to be one of the most profitable for any U.S. industry ever.
3809 2018-12-05 18:28:03 Omg this media narrative won’t die
3810 2018-12-05 18:27:52 help us. start with not taking anything personal. its not that we "hate oil ppl", its just that you guys can't go on with what you're doing.
3811 2018-12-05 18:27:52 In 2006 the British Heart foundation warned that eating a packet of crisps a day - as many school children do - was the equivalent of drinking five litres of cooking oil a year.
3812 2018-12-05 18:27:35 how the fuck does an oil change take  7 hours
3813 2018-12-05 18:27:35 On Tuesday Iranian state broadcasts carried his words, saying “if someday, the United States decides to block Iran’s oil (exports), no oil will be exported from the Persian Gulf.”
3814 2018-12-05 18:27:32 Sounds like oil stocks are about to make a rebound 
3815 2018-12-05 18:27:27 I swear next time I slip on oil at work I’m falling..
3816 2018-12-05 18:27:26 I've got some good ones that help me beat strep! Boiling Ginger and adding lemon. Oregano oil supplements. Gargling warm Himalayan salt water every hour. And drinking lavender water! 
3817 2018-12-05 18:27:25 I literally just had to argue with the oil changing place that I shouldn’t have to pay to replace an incorrect air filter that THEY put in, and had record of. 
3818 2018-12-05 18:27:19 MR SCheer,you outright lie and stretch the truth to blatantly chastise @JustinTrudeau ,but  cant you own up to the fact that you and mr Kenney were members of Harpers govt that did diddly squat to create any export of oil from alberta other than to your Houston freinds for 14 yrs
3819 2018-12-05 18:27:12 @bigotires I’ve just been charged more for an oil change than the two nearest dealerships.
3820 2018-12-05 18:27:11 Hopefully you realize Oil isn’t a viable option as per your administrations Climate Impact Study that was released on Black Friday. Or did you not read that? #definitelydidnotreadthememo
3821 2018-12-05 18:27:09 Are you saying that the business man, genius, who graduated first in his class from the Wharton School of Business is a snake oil salesman?  Or just a dotard.
3822 2018-12-05 18:27:02 Darling, we get a small % of our oil from OPEC. It doesn’t matter to USA anymore. Leave the 80’s and join us in 2018, dumbass. #SaudiLoveAffair #AppeasingaMurderer #IdiotInChief
3823 2018-12-05 18:27:00 I miss paying for oil changes with pizza.
3824 2018-12-05 18:26:43 Nah. My mother took auto shop back in the 50’s when she was in HS. She can change oil, too. Not that she does anymore. She’s old and arthritic now.
3825 2018-12-05 18:26:38 We are constantly working to improve our ingredient panel, including the use of palm oil. While we look to find alternative solutions, we look to only use palm oil certified through RSPO’s (roundtable of sustainable palm oil) mass balance supply chain model.
3826 2018-12-05 18:26:27 "If #Iran decides, a single drop of this region's oil will not be exported and in 90 minutes all Persian Gulf countries will be destroyed." - Shia cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda
3827 2018-12-05 18:26:14 exfoliating my entire body is major to my self-care routine. I’m about to go into work smelling like brown sugar and almond oil. feeling like heaven.
3828 2018-12-05 18:26:11 hey love!! i have acne scars too!! i’ve been using palmarosa essential oil mixed with my daily moisturizer, and it’s been helping!! slowly, but surely. have heard that scar gel (the type pregnant women use) helps too
3829 2018-12-05 18:26:07 One of those enduring questions.
3830 2018-12-05 18:26:06 You're joking or unconscious. She took a 1
Half Billion from OIL & Gas and another Half from WALL STREET.
3831 2018-12-05 18:26:04 How do you indoctrinate ignorance? Our understanding of ignorance is like oil and water. Have a good evening.
3832 2018-12-05 18:25:56 喋る口も食べる口も
3833 2018-12-05 18:25:50 You realize we currently subsidize oil companies to the tune of several tens of billions of dollars? And that renewables already consist of 11% of the US power supply & is increasing exponentially?
3834 2018-12-05 18:25:46 あああああ〜〜〜アロンソくんかチーズの話しちゃうと止まらなくなる
3835 2018-12-05 18:25:45 Cancer taught me to focus on the good, overlook the bad.  I live in the best city in the world for treatment (Houston), a severance pkg fm my oil job, I could focus on my recovery.  It also taught me I wasn't in control. Quit trying to set a date when you could look for a job.
3836 2018-12-05 18:25:43 Impresionante el acuerdo firmado entre Petronas e YPF para iniciar el desarrollo masivo del yacimiento Amarga Chica.Son USD 2.300 millones de inversión en 4 años para llegar a producir 60 mil barriles de petróleo por día,cifra similar al total de la producción actual de shale oil
3837 2018-12-05 18:25:41 Remember earlier this year when they said they found oil in Jamaica... maybe that’s where the 600 barrels went 
3838 2018-12-05 18:25:25 Fumes of course. But a three litre V6 oil burner.
3839 2018-12-05 18:25:20 @realDonaldTrump why are we not using our own oil?
3840 2018-12-05 18:25:20 So let's work it out using today's environment with data available in the market. 
Barrel of crude remains 160 Litres 
USD/LKR 180
Oil Price in USD $57
Price when unloaded at port = 57×180/160 = LKR 64.12
Tax 60.63
Price is 64.12+60.63 = Rs 124.5
Other cost Rs 5.94 
130.44 
3841 2018-12-05 18:25:13 Exactly, and taught us how he destroyed a country such as Iraq entirely and forever in order to steal the oil under fake allegations.
3842 2018-12-05 18:25:06 DL. You forgot not having any "business" dealings with Saudi Arabia. Or how "He" got the oil prices down. Somebody pour holy water on him and see what happens already.
3843 2018-12-05 18:25:02 See am not the only one complaining about the guy, he should watch his attitude and conduct, Ba finmu kusanchi yayi da Kwankwaso Ba.

3844 2018-12-05 18:24:55 @Busisa74 bread suppliers have been reliable - no shortage. Cooking oil has been erratic, Refineries have gone quite. #newnormal
3845 2018-12-05 18:24:53 well, you know that socialist love the poor being poor, and increasing oil prices ensure just that...and OPEC is full of socialist countries and regimes, so expect a cut in production to inflate the prices...
3846 2018-12-05 18:24:47 I got this African black soap with tea tree oil and some African Shea Butter cant tell me shittttttt
3847 2018-12-05 18:24:45 This pic gives me an idea for a mythic outfit; floating red lanterns and oil lamps orbiting the character similar too the "Loki's dream" bones effect, appropriate for Wu Lin and Samurai.
3848 2018-12-05 18:24:42 If your using a oil to cook with but no don't eat the bud you can get constipated 
3849 2018-12-05 18:24:40 Glad to hear.  Keep fighting for Saskatchewan!  Federal carbon tax, oil pipelines and of course the agricultural community 
3850 2018-12-05 18:24:30 Yes - but not on individual commercial developments.

We *do* consider all the ways that oil (and gas) are consumed onshore, where they produce emissions.

Again - we may say more on all of this in the future.
3851 2018-12-05 18:24:23 The World does NOT need oil. #GoSolar #GoElectric
3852 2018-12-05 18:24:07 yea because bones don’t turn to oil
3853 2018-12-05 18:24:00 Biggest misconception: that money made - either off oil royalties or taxes - gets sent "by Alberta" to the ROC. Transfer payments are sent from federal govt to provinces, mainly health care, based on a formula factoring in population, etc.
3854 2018-12-05 18:23:57 So has Beto signed on to the Green New Deal yet?  If he's not sold out to the oil industry then that should be pretty easy.  Would clear up the controversy about all these donations.
3855 2018-12-05 18:23:56 @Ford @VWGroup @michaelgove @Kia_Motors @Honda @Nissan why dont you do the right thing for the planet and replace petrol engines with hydrogen ones that produce nothing but water? The technology has been around years but of course it will kill oil company profits -
3856 2018-12-05 18:23:51 We're realizing now that it never was about the environment.  If it was, the eco NGO's would have set  up shop in Nigeria, Venezuela, etc.  It's all about shutting down Canada's Oil and Gas industry and 10% GDP.  Worst part it was a strategy developed and funded by foreigners.
3857 2018-12-05 18:23:50 Unfamiliar with the scene depicted in the oil painting.  Any idea what it is? Of course, the painting of the officers behind Bush  41
3858 2018-12-05 18:23:43 LIER!  Since when have you cared about clean water, when you’ve cut the budget for the EPA, deleted all reference to global warming, you’ve let your oil buddies destroy public lands to pollute the water, and now you’ve given the ok to destroy the Arctic by your oil buddies. LIER!
3859 2018-12-05 18:23:31 This so sums up the Green Party,they never think things through.They have delayed tmx but in doing so they have made it necessary for oil to be transported by rail rather than by a much safer pipeline.They want to phase out  oil, but the world will still use oil, just not ours
3860 2018-12-05 18:23:25 This is the guy who commuted between Los Angeles and Sacramento via private Jet when he was Governor.
3861 2018-12-05 18:23:23 People would rather risk the future of this planet that their children must live & let corporations run amuck that have no interest in protecting the planet than stopping millions/deaths/yr from air pollution & WAR, + have insurance we'll be safe from #globalwarming. ALL for oil?
3862 2018-12-05 18:23:15 Crude oil .. utilities are pretty safe all time
3863 2018-12-05 18:23:14 Oil nice bounce. Technical retrace should see a bounce back to $60 in coming weeks.
3864 2018-12-05 18:22:53 it’s that oil change you’ve been needing
3865 2018-12-05 18:22:52 Oil
3866 2018-12-05 18:22:49 You do know that we are self sufficient- when it comes to oil supply... right?
3867 2018-12-05 18:22:48 Sorry I thought you were someone else in the thread I was also discussing with and I didn't noticed.

- I'm French and I wonder why I would follow US news for climate change
- There's no reason why the burden of proof should be on me. Why clean the wax when you can show me proofs
3868 2018-12-05 18:22:45 いっしょにぽちゃしよう…
3869 2018-12-05 18:22:43 I do not like OPEC oil. But I do think @realDonaldTrump is amazing and a blessing for America. Maybe soon America can be energy independent. #RNWO
3870 2018-12-05 18:22:40 Yes if you don’t now 

All the world now talking about Mohammed Bin Salman  

All the world talking about Saudi Arabia.   Saudi Arabia is better then Iran    Saudi Arabia is the first one in oil. 1 on the world

3876 2018-12-05 18:22:16 HOPEFULLY?!?...you just said the other day that YOU drove down oil prices.    Sounds like you didn’t tell the truth!    OF COURSE YOU DIDNT!!
3877 2018-12-05 18:22:13 i gotta get me a charger for my Oil pen

3879 2018-12-05 18:22:06 We need higher oil prices !!  Have to keep the oil industry going don’t forget about North Dakota and Texas
3880 2018-12-05 18:22:03 cbd oil  doesn’t help me all. I’ve tried it so many times and it doesn’t help
3881 2018-12-05 18:21:56 But here in Kirkland Washington I can hardly set my face on African stores, gotta drive almost an hour & half to reach Seattle to get Pam oil. It’s a struggle here. And she’s always torturing me wit the pictures. I feed on them though 
3882 2018-12-05 18:21:56 Are you also worried about accidents in oil, gas, coal, and hydro?
3883 2018-12-05 18:21:50 We shouldn’t be going backwards like we have since you have stolen your office.  You are allowing oil companies to drill in National parks, cutting back on environmental laws so the big corporations can make more money.  Money is always #1 with you

3896 2018-12-05 18:21:07 Repeating your candidate announcement tweets months after they first appear - Harper's old trick of announcing the same item several times to make it look like you're accomplishing far more than you actually are. That momentum has already stalled out, eh?
3897 2018-12-05 18:20:52 GW Bush stopped allowing CITGO to be sold in the U.S. market as punishment for not allowing our oil companies to profit off of their oil reserves and they lost most of the U.S. market which hurt Venezuela in a big way.
3898 2018-12-05 18:20:50 ...and you'd be hit particularly hard the way you've been leaking oil.
3899 2018-12-05 18:20:47 I’ve been mixing my face makeup with a sample of the Josie Maran argan oil and it’s really nice idk if anyone cares but yeah
3900 2018-12-05 18:20:46 It wasn't all from the US. Most was money owed from other countries for oil they bought.
3901 2018-12-05 18:20:46 like..... the oil???
3902 2018-12-05 18:20:40 Where can you buy oil at $10 a barrel, it closed yesterday at $53.25/62.08 ?
3903 2018-12-05 18:20:34 Totally agree. But according to The International Energy Agency, the demand for energy in the next two decades will double in India . China will continue to be the biggest consumer of oil, ensuring global C02 emissions continuing to rise regardless of action in Europe or the USA.
3904 2018-12-05 18:20:34 I can't even rem what I did, but it's not his fault, he doesn't know who we are to his boss, kaawai nisane yasa bama azalzalawa 
3905 2018-12-05 18:20:26 You do know that the US gets most of it's oil from the US, Canada and Latin America, right?
You do know that the Saudi gov ordered the killing of #Kashoggi, right? Our own IC says so. 
How about you just resign now before you embarrass yourself any further.
3906 2018-12-05 18:20:26 Even using that absurd logic - what happens when you remove oil from your motor? 
3907 2018-12-05 18:20:25 Carbon emissions rose last year, climate change is accelerating, we are in deep trouble.... so yes, oil prices should be higher.
3908 2018-12-05 18:20:22 Opinion:  Can Beto O'Rourke Go Take A Flying Leap?
3909 2018-12-05 18:20:16 I totally get that. I feel that currently, we are doing the Saudis dirty work for them in regards to Iran. We interfere in many places we shouldn't for oil etc. Thank you for the intelligent response, and for not calling me un-American 
3910 2018-12-05 18:20:16 はぁ、はぁ、あふぃ！

5城トラウマが～～！((( ；ﾟДﾟ)))
3911 2018-12-05 18:19:56 I’ve been hoping the fake Hispanic, little Bobby O’Rourke would take a flying leap… maybe onto a frozen lake or into the Rio Grande?
3912 2018-12-05 18:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

3923 2018-12-05 18:18:26 No doubt he is, do you mean he block you? 
I am quite sure he is doing things base on certain reasons.

I am waiting for your reply to know what to do next?
3924 2018-12-05 18:18:20 Hasn't a lot gone on at Horse Hill this week.  
@WealdOilers and @Adrianwfire really are an amazing pair and any

3927 2018-12-05 18:18:11 Today in Canada flags are at half mast everywhere, but the Toronto Stock Exchange is open and doing quite well despite the big fall in the NYSE yesterday. We are doing well without Trump's interferences.
We have oil to sell and soybean farmers are sold out thanks to the Chinese.

3930 2018-12-05 18:18:06 It took a herculean effort to produce tax cuts, 2 Supreme Court Justices, VA Reform, rebuilding of the military, Senate majority & increased oil production. Trump did that with a little bit of help from others. #Trump2020

3935 2018-12-05 18:17:49 ..and oil isn't infinite and Climate Change is *not* a hoax. I just *believe* the effect of CO2 is wrong.
3936 2018-12-05 18:17:42 I Will Not Speak Kindly of the Dead. Bush Was Detestable.: SO IS "OIL WAR CRIMINAL" GEORGIE BOY BUSHWHACKER AND HIS SLIMY LIL' BROTHER LEACH !!
3937 2018-12-05 18:17:40 California full of money trees apparently
3938 2018-12-05 18:17:37 One of your pre-worn best smelly t-shirts with a drop or two of lavender oil..
3939 2018-12-05 18:17:34 Another glaring reason is they decided to protect their oil reserves from large companies like Chevron, Shell, Exxon etc, by nationalizing it so the profits would go instead to the people of Venezuela.  The U.S. and Big Oil were not happy about this.  See, oil belongs to the U.S.
3940 2018-12-05 18:17:34 In future- can we not refer to mineral oil as placebo?
3941 2018-12-05 18:17:33 Some people like oil high some like it low. Never waste a single drop of oil polluting the skies.
3942 2018-12-05 18:17:30 It's a crying shame to see how the world really works..For instance if oil or gold was found in ur backyard it's govt property but if they find drugs it's urz!  #HoodedSouljahTalk
3943 2018-12-05 18:17:25 Oh Donald.  Oil is going the way of #TraitorDonald and #TrumpCrimeFamily
3944 2018-12-05 18:17:08 Yeah, had to block the nuisance. I think he is one of the very few I ve ever blocked.
3945 2018-12-05 18:17:04 Exactly, it's like they took their cut before the discovery ! ... If Greece has its waters protected and we discover a lot of oil and gas, Greece could be rich like Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia.

3949 2018-12-05 18:16:43 A study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Energy found 50 percent of new oil production in America would be unprofitable if not for government subsidies.
As oil prices increase government subsidies are simply “transfer payments” to oil profits as executive pay
3950 2018-12-05 18:16:43 Oil is the new garbage with the EV in the horizon.
3951 2018-12-05 18:16:34 That's why you the best president ever you understand what hurts people and yes oil is a big one thanks Mr Trump  FYI you looked good at funeral with the First Lady .. Simply the best 
3952 2018-12-05 18:16:33 'What's more 33 than owning an olive oil & balsamic vinegar store?' What? I hope you did a proof of concept?
3953 2018-12-05 18:16:32 @cnnbrk Really breaking news? I’m sure Someone has been abducted, a family lost their home to a fire, domestic violence, a murder, suicide, tainted water, radiation, oil spills... shall I continue? Where did you guys study journalism? You should be disgusted with yourselves!!!!!
3954 2018-12-05 18:16:32 Nigerian system has esteemed oil more above the relevance of human capital development. Human capital is the new oil.
3955 2018-12-05 18:16:29 I can’t believe the president on this tweet while your at funeral or everyone else oil can’t wait do you’ll have any respect wow god help us all
3956 2018-12-05 18:16:29 PSA

Drinking truffle oil is a terrible idea, would not recommend
3957 2018-12-05 18:16:14 Hopefully ' their move ' will involve a couple of large vans with sat nav set to M25 ! Which our oil money paid for anyway

3959 2018-12-05 18:15:55 Oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, oven-safe pan, 30 minutes .. Lowest effort for return you can probably get.

You can do it with nearly any vegetable, so it don't even have to be broccoli.
3960 2018-12-05 18:15:48 America has its own oil
3961 2018-12-05 18:15:40 You’re in the show actually. Someone has to rub warm oil on his chest.
3962 2018-12-05 18:15:39 Iran threatens closure of St of Hormuz if US sanctions Iranian oil exports
3963 2018-12-05 18:15:34 Oil money, no english players, no youth, and now the scousers are crying why dont teams attack city lol

3965 2018-12-05 18:15:09 Is little neck clams an omega 3 fish oil?
3966 2018-12-05 18:15:05 Keep allowing your controllers in the House of Saud to murder dissidents with no consequences, & maybe oil prices will stay lower.

That’s a trade off that no decent country, with a moral leader, would ever consider, but a tRUmp-led country...

3970 2018-12-05 18:14:53 A good way to detox.  Oil immersion sucks toxins out through skin.  Ancients used olive oil or honey but cbd oil sounds reasonable.
3971 2018-12-05 18:14:41 Yes, god bless the man and his family who started two wars over . . .

:checks notes:

 . . . . oil.
3972 2018-12-05 18:14:27 I’m up at 7 every morning to take my son to school.  I listen to the comedy station or old school hip hop mixtapes to get me up and moving. “Oil can!”
3973 2018-12-05 18:14:27 Honestly, from an Alberta stand point, oil and gas, either party would probably be ok on that issue. However, PPC is going to reform equalization, which is huge for AB and SK. @CPC_HQ is also beholden to the UN and signed the Paris accord, stating they’ll meet the targets. Hmmm
3974 2018-12-05 18:14:18 Saying no POTUS is responsible for the USA becoming a leading producer of oil and gas is incorrect. Trump opened Federal land to oil & gas fracking, in doing so, fracking is used AWAY from dense populations, away from private land!
3975 2018-12-05 18:14:16 Have seen & even met a few public figures. But George Bush was briefly my congressman (Texas 7th) when I was a child in a rapidly evolving Houston. Both of us Atlantic Coast transplants. #Bush41 was a unique character in that era in Houston and the #oil/energy business. #OOTT
3976 2018-12-05 18:14:08 でぶぼさいこぉ〜
3977 2018-12-05 18:14:02 It is Corporate greed. I remember in 2005 when oil went Skyrocket the price of asphalt shingles made from oil also went up. While the oil prices have came down but the shingle prices have never came down. Corporate greed. You can't convince people that don't know any better tho
3978 2018-12-05 18:14:02 If it works for you then keep on keepin on but I recommend pure argan oil as an alternative lol
3979 2018-12-05 18:13:54 I thing we arabs need higher Oil prices
3980 2018-12-05 18:13:46 @jimmykimmel have you seen trumps latest tweet. He is celebrating President Bush life in one tweet and one hour later tweeting about oil prices WHILES AT AT FUNERAL  I would ask who does that but we clearly know who does this
3981 2018-12-05 18:13:45 With the reusable cleaning wipes: I put them in a big mason jar with diluted vinegar (sometimes a drop of essential oil for scent) and pull out quickly. They are always ready for me then! (Also cut up socks/tshirts as wipes run out/have old ones)
3982 2018-12-05 18:13:37 @BeachEnergyLtd when are you going to do some renewables instead of oil and gas
3983 2018-12-05 18:13:35 After years of austerity following the financial crash of 2008, the 2016 vote caused the pound to drop 20%. That means imports including oil and gas have gone up by around 20%. 

All forms of brexit make us worse off so let's have a #PeoplesVote with an #OptionToRemain !

3984 2018-12-05 18:13:31 All that cannabis oil is not good for you !
3985 2018-12-05 18:13:28 The world is expected to run out of oil in about 53 years.  It's never too soon to start pushing towards alternatives.
3986 2018-12-05 18:13:26 @djkhaled what beard oil do you use?
3987 2018-12-05 18:13:22 sugar cane crushing
oil crops growing  planning 
textile industry revival
reduced rates of fertilizers.
flat rates of agri tube well
3988 2018-12-05 18:13:21 UK has pushed #fracking & extraction of oil too, subsidized #fossilfuels in many ways including Capacity Market, suppressed solar & onshore wind, ended zero-carbon new-builds & assistance for building insulation etc,  provided export guarantees to overseas fossil fuel projects...
3989 2018-12-05 18:13:14 If the price of oil come to zero still it won't effects the price of oil in #Afghanistan and no one care about it @mediaoffice_mof @ARG_AFG @ashrafghani @hchakhansuri
3990 2018-12-05 18:13:14 if you are an american. its pretty comical that you would worry about what a country is doing to its own. not only do we leave our people in 3rd world conditions within america, but we have been responsible for millions of deaths in the middle east all for oil.
3991 2018-12-05 18:13:08 If you cared about the environment you wouldn’t support DJT, who’s nothing but a puppet for the oil and coal lobbyists. Hell he pushed legislation that allowed coal ash dumped in our waterways, trying to limit solar and wind energy growth, and cozy with Saudi and Russia oil/energ
3992 2018-12-05 18:13:08 Shows how much you know about oil. A fair stable price is what the world needs. Not too high or low. We have a lot of jobs that depend on a reasonable and stable price of oil.
3993 2018-12-05 18:13:06 Damn. CAD losing strength bc oil rises, really messed up my trades
3994 2018-12-05 18:13:05 So I’m FaceTiming Tyler and he says “my trucks running low on gas and I need an oil change so I think imma just go get a new car today” like okayyyyyy
3995 2018-12-05 18:13:04 I actually took one of my days off ... Off. And even tho I have cleaned and need an oil change I slept n lounged around and read my book n now I'm at sushi waiting for a friend and I'm so relaxed compared to the high strung burnt out ball of anxiety i've been
3996 2018-12-05 18:12:56 Thanks Chris. I may be mistaken, but hasn’t @theCCCuk commented on both shale gas & airport developments? If so, why not oil, & also (if so), surely commenting on the collective suite of CO2 rich activities is very much the role of the CCC given the UK’s carbon budget framing?
3997 2018-12-05 18:12:47 Right-wing politics in a nutshell. Your white ancestors built stuff, that means you built it. Your grandfather is an oil tycoon, you're an "entrepreneur".
3998 2018-12-05 18:12:45 Donny the Dink, it's Canada you got to worry about as they provide 40% of your oil.......
3999 2018-12-05 18:12:38 Is it possible for the goose to reach peak honks like we're reaching peak oil?
4000 2018-12-05 18:12:20 That woman probably thinks diffusing lavender oil and taking epsom salt baths is the cure to everything 
4001 2018-12-05 18:11:57 Higher oil prices is why MBS and Putin high-fived.

The laughter was about you though...
4002 2018-12-05 18:11:55 What an idiot: Oil is bought in $... we import a lot of food in Euro or other currency...so how an earth a weak £ helps the power of buying? ...by the way, don't give me the bla bla about exporting, as that does reflect very little into the wages.
4003 2018-12-05 18:11:48 Who said the russians wanted to make afghans comrades? The only reason russians took the landlocked desert was that it was in between russia and iran, the gateway for oil pipeline between arab world and russia. After WWII each and every war has an oil connection.
4004 2018-12-05 18:11:46 And the cheapest cooking oil, SOY bean oil, contains estrogen...they really out to get us
4005 2018-12-05 18:11:40 Sauté with sesame oil until a little crispy, add sesame seeds. Yum!
4006 2018-12-05 18:11:39 Not sure why you're so intent on keeping us married to oil. The easiest way to drive down the price is to decrease demand. You doing anything about that or is this your typical dumbassery at work?
4007 2018-12-05 18:11:35 The only reason Conservatives stand up for workers is to jump on them with their cleats. How long did your party let workers walk out for before legislating them back to work? Feel free to use hours to avoid those pesky decimal points necessary when measuring in days.
4008 2018-12-05 18:11:35 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has once again threatened to close the #Strait of #Hormuz, which is vital to up to one-third of all global #oil shipping as it's a key transit choke point in the Persian Gulf.
4009 2018-12-05 18:11:34 i need.....chili oil
4010 2018-12-05 18:11:33 bought castor oil <3 can’t wait to shit my guts out tonight
4011 2018-12-05 18:11:30 Currently playing a game. Here we go from domestic terror to oil?
4012 2018-12-05 18:11:19 as it turns out he sure as fvck did the bidding of big oil    so there's that . Now if you're talking about ceo's giving to campaigns that is obviously different .
4013 2018-12-05 18:11:12 @ciaoobelllaxo I saw you were struggling with your hair! Just a PSA tea tree is VERY toxic for dogs! (even the smell alone) try using organic coconut oil! It's great for hair growth & dandruff! I cover my hair in it & leave it on overnight, then wash my hair normally the next day
4014 2018-12-05 18:11:07  Oga they're really making you loose chills this day, but your expectations of how people should behave is what's disappointing you when they behave otherwise.
Our mentality and exposure are not the same.
Mu dinga musu uzuri.
4015 2018-12-05 18:11:06 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
4016 2018-12-05 18:11:05 I can 0nly assume you have money invested in United States or Russian oil.
You saying nothing about the Russians, doing pretty well the same things in Syria and Ukraine.
4017 2018-12-05 18:10:53 Yea, let’s go back to using whale oil.
4018 2018-12-05 18:10:51 Well, Venezuela does have very clean elections that U.N. observers have praised for their transparency.
So they elected a socialist government by an overwhelming majority.
But the Venezuelans decided against selling their oil to USA.
Now they are being sanctioned.
By America.
4019 2018-12-05 18:10:48 Also she's Swedish, and so the people she listened to probably didn't talk to her a lot about Florida. And when I took the example of Bangladesh and Tuvalu, it's because they are current victims of this problem
4020 2018-12-05 18:10:48 Evangelical snake oil salesman. Now worshiping the"golden calf" instead of God.
4021 2018-12-05 18:10:47 heat up coconut oil,olive oil and add an egg in the mixture . Dampen your hair and apply it all overrr. Then wait 45 min. Wash it out good wit shampoo . Or try the inversion method flip your head upside down and massage warm oil into your scalp
4022 2018-12-05 18:10:39 Since America has enough oil to last around another 300 years,  why do we still have that 40 year old agreement with the Saudis??? We have a surplus of natural gas that should be exported as well as oil.
4023 2018-12-05 18:10:37 Conservator narrating: As you can see, this painting has a thick layer of linseed oil. 
Me watching my thousandth video in a row: Egh. Fucking linseed oil...
4024 2018-12-05 18:10:36 I’ve been an acrylic fan for years because of the drying time - it reminds me of the difference of carving vs clay. Quality acrylic looks indistinguishable from oil. Glaze depth is superb.
4025 2018-12-05 18:10:33 Even at 16, I knew he was a mercenary. Ex-head of the CIA? Oil oligarch? Son of a Nazi profiteer? It wasn't rocket science.

This was the man GOP saw fit to raise to the WH, after a senile actor. Let's stop pretending we've ever known a noble GOP. The party's worse, not different
4026 2018-12-05 18:10:28 Amazing. Aren't enough that you protect their and your incomes, you want also to bankrupt US oil shale producers. Less than $60 aren't a sustainable price for American shale oil producers. Bankruptcies of US oil producers are a part of your deal with Saudis?
4027 2018-12-05 18:10:24 It’s one of our most favorite days of the year! Happy #BathTubPartyDay.

4031 2018-12-05 18:10:17 Well the increase in shipping oil by rail will increase the risk to these rivers exponentially. Well done.
4032 2018-12-05 18:10:16 To be fair, H.W. WAS an oil man. But, you know, MBS seems to be as needy for reassurance as Orange One himself, I guess.
4033 2018-12-05 18:10:12 i’m finna drink the castor oil FUCK IT

4038 2018-12-05 18:09:49 Manchester is blue? U can't even fill the empthiad might be shite but it will still take city at least another of oil money to catch up
4039 2018-12-05 18:09:45 Are tum padho news to tume pata  chele ki 2014 se pehle crude oil ke price kya tha aur ab crude oil international price kya hai
4040 2018-12-05 18:09:41 I haven’t watched Stossel’s video. Perhaps it is more nuanced or only focuses on the extreme cases. I was merely reacting to the headline/title. I agree extreme, ongoing central planning has certainly not had a good history.
4041 2018-12-05 18:09:28 I'm hoping the rand stays firm and the oil price doesn't climb, although I can't help but feel sad for Venezuelans whose economy relies so heavily on oil sales...
4042 2018-12-05 18:09:28 The nominal relative value may increase but the real return ends up being flat. If gold is rising, so are the inputs which are absorbed through the mining process: energy, labor, capital, time... so gold goes up, as does oil, your groceries etc.
4043 2018-12-05 18:09:27 There's no excuse for trying to make it seem like the paranormal is real. It's stupid and your mentor needs to stop...wait, he can't. He's a snake oil merchant! 
4044 2018-12-05 18:09:26 Have you ever seen cattle grazing in Texas or New Mexico? They are not a land use problem. They live in harmony with nature. They graze on land that would not and could not be used for crops. They improve the condition of the soil. They live on land with wind farms and oil wells.
4045 2018-12-05 18:09:22 I tried the oil off lazarusnaturals(plus I got a discount there), its okay i guess i take about 200-300mg but dont really feel anything in terms of relaxation.
4046 2018-12-05 18:09:14 Ik heb castor oil gekocht en hopelijk ga ik nu eindelijk volle wenkies krijgen
4047 2018-12-05 18:09:14 I was once told by a man from Calgary I talked story with on a flight  who said we have more oil in Calgary, Texas and da kine then the whole Middle East. 
Hmmmm.........
4048 2018-12-05 18:09:12 Just waved goodbye to over 250,-

Why? Becaude every commission, be it a plush, a harnes or a kigurumi needs base products. And not only the things you see and wear!

Artists who sew use chalk, needles, pins, bobbins, wonderclips, more pins, and oil for their products!
4049 2018-12-05 18:09:10 I spent all day yesterday doing this oil painting for my moms Christmas gift (she bought the canvas) and I've never dealt with Oils before and first of all dont buy oils unless you know how to handle them bc I did NOT. Painting looks fine but my brushes??? how to clean???
4050 2018-12-05 18:09:10 Interesting point, because in the ME we target locations susceptible for destabilization.  The torror threat there was created by us decades ago.  Why not another country?  Cherry picked for oil...
4051 2018-12-05 18:09:08 Mexico City-based Sierra Oil & Gas signed an agreement that will result in its business being integrated with Deutsche Erdoel AG. #Germany #cdmx
4052 2018-12-05 18:09:05 Sometimes it is Oo.
4053 2018-12-05 18:08:59 Baste in olive oil, salt and a spoonful of sugar (no joke) and roast at 500 degrees until cooked. The. best.
4054 2018-12-05 18:08:50 Why am I out of school o. I'll just carry our Ancestral Ogun shrine and place it somewhere in School so i can pour Palm oil on it @ Break time. I'll see who'll tell me to remove it
4055 2018-12-05 18:08:45 @chigrl Just started following you. I live in South Africa and its my dream and passion to learn how to trade crude oil.  Where do I start. Thanks Howard
4056 2018-12-05 18:08:39 Yes and then ask the minister why she is going to tax small &medium businesses,gas,oil  but cement companies coal plant and other large emitters will get anywhere from a 80 to 95% exemptions.  Also ask her about all raw sewage being dumped in our waterways.
4057 2018-12-05 18:08:35 Anyone have a pick up van and a pass near petrojam later?
Ah beg unnuh pick up bout 3 barrel of oil fi me.
4058 2018-12-05 18:08:23 Hutchings asks about restarting oil production during the storm/oil spill. Coady says awaiting results of investigation. Monitoring investigation.
4059 2018-12-05 18:08:18 We are taking steps to: end all tanker traffic, stop all oil mining,block all pipelines.
4060 2018-12-05 18:08:14 What if we start finding a replacement for oil so we don’t need them?
4061 2018-12-05 18:08:09 I put straight olive oil in my hair. I'm desperate for moisture
4062 2018-12-05 18:08:04 What would you call Ocasio Cortez statements that Tesla should return a dividend to gov?
Obvious she doesnt know the company does not make any profit as yet, but the underlying message is government ownership.
4063 2018-12-05 18:07:58 I can’t take it by mouth but I have used magnesium oil.  It has side affects on my digestive system though.  I need to try melatonin again I think.
4064 2018-12-05 18:07:55 If he's truly a sarkin yaki tell him to be objective and stop blocking people who he can't debate on trivial issues, it's a sign of weakness.
Election no be war.
4065 2018-12-05 18:07:55 Yo...coming to get an oil change & wait for for over 30 mins is a reminder of why I’d rather do it myself. I do my oil changes in 10 mins, if that. Not having any free time can have its downside.
4066 2018-12-05 18:07:53 @ciaoobelllaxo I know you're struggling with your hair! Just a PSA tea tree is VERY toxic for dogs! (even the smell alone) but try organic coconut oil! it's GREAT for hair growth AND dandruff! I cover my hair in it over night and wash it out the next day! It's done wonders! xo
4067 2018-12-05 18:07:42 ready to be off /// already gotta do an oil change tomorrow
4068 2018-12-05 18:07:41 นั่นสิน้า 555555
4069 2018-12-05 18:07:41 Is bad that oil thing to me is the worst
4070 2018-12-05 18:07:40 How can we expect stupid people to understand environmental science? I wonder if they all know that we only have a little more than 50 years of crude oil left on the whole earth due to increased demand. When ice age returns humans won't have diddly squat to warm next generation.
4071 2018-12-05 18:07:39 Strike while the iron is still smoldering from being shot down in flames.
4072 2018-12-05 18:07:38 Tell’em you’ll take the old oil and dispose of it yourself.
4073 2018-12-05 18:07:38 Obama laid off thousands in the OIL&Energy in Wyoming and tried to shut down MEAT & OIL industries in Texas, Gov Abbott didn’t let him mess with Texas..
Trump is creating thousands of jobs, after tax cuts, small business started booming and hiring
4074 2018-12-05 18:07:36 Can somebody explain to me why we are happy with oil price going lower when we are the biggest oil producer on this planet??!
We get that its more money to the consumer that he can spend elsewhere, but thats less money to the united states pockets too, right?
4075 2018-12-05 18:07:35 And also receive a nomination for “Small Cap Oil Company of the year”.
4076 2018-12-05 18:07:23 You just ask how did di pnp get involved in the whole issue affecting petrojam and I sighted 4 you some that was left in the PIPELINE and it jus so happens to be the $5b worth of oil that’s unaccounted for. We must remember ja don’t produce oil and while Everything in the report
4077 2018-12-05 18:07:17 Hahahahaha spa oil juskoo
4078 2018-12-05 18:07:15 Best thing I ever did was read Deep Nutrition by Dr. Cate Shanahan (shout out to @AJA_Cortes for recommending it).

Family has been vegetable/seed oil free for almost 10 months now. 

Seen marked improvement in my health, how I feel, energy, and my skin.

Truly life changing.
4079 2018-12-05 18:07:12 my car is at that point where i’m embarrassed to go get an oil change cuz i’ve waited so long
4080 2018-12-05 18:07:10 At a glance, middle eastern nations are still atop the charts as richest nations. We are bring that forward with out economy because oil dependency is still the reality here and throughout the world. Africa... (cont)
4081 2018-12-05 18:07:01 What, the halo is insufficiently subtle?
4082 2018-12-05 18:07:01 Truth! It's wearing to be the bigger person over and over while the squeakiest wheel gets the oil.
4083 2018-12-05 18:06:59 5 billion in unaccounted for oil since 2013.

90 million a month basically.

How and why ?

Wow.

#PetrojamReport
4084 2018-12-05 18:06:57 Hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs when crude oil prices began their downward slide. I don't think everyone would agree with you.
4085 2018-12-05 18:06:57 What the World needs is less dependence on oil.  With you fining people for using electric cars, you clearly show you do not get this concept.
4086 2018-12-05 18:06:50 My mom(white): Have you taken your vitamins? Put some tea tree oil on it 
4087 2018-12-05 18:06:41 Agreed. But rampant inflation would? My point is that populist like Sirota shy away from really impactful solutions and only engage in popular rhetoric that will not save the planet. Bashing big oil is popular, but unless we stop flying and transporting goods, it is meaningless.
4088 2018-12-05 18:06:41 They say “Don’t try to identify that section of property!  It can identify as it wishes!”
4089 2018-12-05 18:06:18 How does oil go missing 
4090 2018-12-05 18:06:17 Hell of a price to pay for a bankrupt country trying to get their own oil back from the thieves who stole it.
4091 2018-12-05 18:06:17 I like to toss it with olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika and roast the florets in the oven.
4092 2018-12-05 18:06:10 really glad i’m leaving iupui but also mad about having to pay $1000 for my housing contract and also leaving the friends i made 5 minutes ago and not being able to walk to lucas oil stadium in 20 minutes will be weird

4096 2018-12-05 18:06:02 Terus ya udah sembari ngoles facial oil gini, baru sadar filmnya gak sempet dibahas.
4097 2018-12-05 18:05:41 And yet, my dude. he voted to disallow Arctic Drilling, voted against weakening regs on pipelines, voted against weakening oceanic policy that checks oil companies, and a host of other anti-oil votes.  So, huh. Go figure.
4098 2018-12-05 18:05:39 man whattt! i went in for an oil change last month & it took 2.5 hrs i was pissed
4099 2018-12-05 18:05:31 Ukraine feeds Russia... Water > Food > Gas Oil Gold $$$ etc
4100 2018-12-05 18:05:28 No scientific or political institution claimed this, but if they said it, it should be easy for you to prove me wrong, I'll wait.

Disinformation will bring you likes from climate change deniers, but won't make you right.

Be scientific as you claim to be and cite your source

4102 2018-12-05 18:05:20 Also: toss in olive oil with S & P to taste, spread on a baking sheet &  roast for 8 minutes in a 450-degree oven. Remove, sprinkle with sliced garlic, roast for 7 more minutes. Finish with red pepper flakes.
4103 2018-12-05 18:05:19 U.S.-specific data from the report shows that nearly 100,000 people lost their jobs in the oil and gas extraction and supporting segments between October 2014 and January this year. More than half of those were in Texas, according to statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor.

4106 2018-12-05 18:04:57 Sarki.....
4107 2018-12-05 18:04:49 So true. We can't forget the Bush love for wars, especially when their selfish greed for oil was concerned.  Just because they're better than Trump (and face it, who isn't?) does not make them Nelson Mandela!
4108 2018-12-05 18:04:46 Roast in oven with sesame oil, bread crumbs, and dusted with Parmesan cheese.
4109 2018-12-05 18:04:43 went back 2 my back Dr this morning. surgery 8-21-2018 it fix my leg pain not my back pain. Stop pain meds and says 2 me that he going 2 send me 2 a psychiatrist he thinks that the pain is in my mind  guess I will be in a lot of pain. I ask could take hemp oil if I did he quit me
4110 2018-12-05 18:04:43 Thoughts and prayers!

Wait, I thought you controlled oil prices? Oh, that's only when they go down, huh?
4111 2018-12-05 18:04:36 The oil price is too low. You have no idea how the industry works, have you?
4112 2018-12-05 18:04:33 Is there an essential oil that will make all of my problems go away?
4113 2018-12-05 18:04:33 How does ur beauty remove Buhari from office? Or decrease the price of rice and groundnut oil in the market?
4114 2018-12-05 18:04:29 That's reality as the oil starts to deplete with more and more people on the planet the price of oil will go up. You as POTUS need to think on a larger scale
4115 2018-12-05 18:04:15 Tears and beard oil dont mix. GET IT TOGETHER
4116 2018-12-05 18:04:10 We could just invade Saudi Arabia and take their oil because of that journalist's murder.
4117 2018-12-05 18:04:10 Well this conversation started because you weren't very open minded to the oils and the science John's Hopkins discovered. I know despite antibiotics I'm still infected I can feel it, haven't taken them in over a year. But oregano oil has done what they would've during that time
4118 2018-12-05 18:04:02 how exactly does one lose a barrel of oil?

4121 2018-12-05 18:03:48 @JustinTrudeau you have killed an oil industry and a car industry, insulted workers, created division between languages. Canadians demand better answers from you. Canadians demand you be better
4122 2018-12-05 18:03:45 The menorah represents the holiday of Hanukah which celebrates the Maccabeean rebellion against the Seleucid empire. The holiday is referred to as the celebration of light because there was only enough oil in the temple in Jerusalem to light its lamps for 1 day, yet it lasted 7.
4123 2018-12-05 18:03:42 Lets not forget ( Iraq war ) the big lie to steal oil .

4127 2018-12-05 18:03:33 If his dream came true, America would be an unbroken landscape of oil wells, fracking, golf courses, and trump towers.
4128 2018-12-05 18:03:12 do you even have a clue who the largest oil producing country in the world is?
4129 2018-12-05 18:03:11 George was brilliant - never get tired of watching.  Not so sure any of his questions ever answered about where the Iraqi oil went...............
4130 2018-12-05 18:03:05 Chestnut Stuffing loaf with maple syrup glazed roast parsnips, swede and carrots, roasted potatoes basted with sea salted oil, lashings of herby gravy ... and those Brussel sprout things

4132 2018-12-05 18:02:57 Warned us all about climate change also. Tried to cut back on oil and coal and @GOP roasted him for it. Reagan's New Day BS was seen as a positive alternative to The Truth that Carter was saying that no one wanted to hear.

4135 2018-12-05 18:02:53 Alternative energy investment would have cured high oil prices. But you just go on staring into the sun and not using it to power homes.
4136 2018-12-05 18:02:37 Fowler is going to do his workout then a vape magic show after demonstrating what smoke animals he can produce using cbd oil.
4137 2018-12-05 18:02:33 @Valvoline Hey. The negligence of your Instant Oil Change Location in Dublin OH damaged my car, almost caused me to wreck in traffic and they refuse to call me back. Any help here?
4138 2018-12-05 18:02:28 It's part of UN Agenda 21's "sustainable development" to reclaim the earth & depopulate the world: eliminate resources -oil, mining, forestry, cattle/beef, farms, private property, asphalt; cars, religion. Most people unaware, MSM complicit. Must get rid of unelected UN and NGOs.
4139 2018-12-05 18:02:25 Oil is currency please think b4 you speak and your name calling is so mature what are you 12? Besides you buy it from Saudi Arabia now atleast then you wont need tankers

Trudeau & Notley have been in for 3 years, yet you expect them to fix the issue, that was created by years of spending the oil money without investment. Too easy to blame them
4163 2018-12-05 18:00:20 Y'all I just sniffed some peppermint oil and my nose just cleared RIGHT tf up, why the HELL have I been unpleasantly high on sudafed for the past 3 days???
4164 2018-12-05 18:00:05 Obama laid off thousands in the OIL&Energy in Wyoming and tried to shut down MEAT & OIL industries in Texas, Gov Abbott didn’t let him mess with Texas..
Trump is creating thousands of jobs, after tax cuts, small business started booming and hiring
4165 2018-12-05 18:00:05 Based on oil futures price reaction today, I'm not confident what's been discussed will be enough to buoy WTI > $50. #OPEC

4167 2018-12-05 17:59:52 It costs $22 to ship crude oil via railway cars from Alberta to the Gulf of mexico, “Unless the rail guys offer massive discounts in freight, it’s not economical to lock in rail volumes,” said one trader.

1 BBL with $19 of condensate, and that costs $22 to ship, sell for $20?
4168 2018-12-05 17:59:43 Sheet pan. Olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder.
4169 2018-12-05 17:59:40 Do u think they will fill the SUnday Gap in oil now?
4170 2018-12-05 17:59:22 My boyfriend has rubbed off on me and now I don’t pronounce oil correctly
4171 2018-12-05 17:59:21 Just a few drops of sesame oil and he would have loved the stuff.
4172 2018-12-05 17:59:19 Then understand that the folks that will probably win the next election are doggedly prospecting for oil in the Borno Basin. Think about this...
4173 2018-12-05 17:59:14 Obama tried to stop new drilling. Hard to have an oil boom without new production. He also attacked fracking frequently.
4174 2018-12-05 17:59:04 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
4175 2018-12-05 17:58:57 Especially when United States exports 51% of the world oil and we get less than 13% from Saudi Arabia! We could be totally self sufficient without OPEC. But where would Jared Kushner and Trump get there extra hundreds of millions of dollars for real estate
4176 2018-12-05 17:58:56 We need to see more investment in natural resources. But, with oil companies more than willing to suck your tiny mushroom cap, this will never happen.

4182 2018-12-05 17:58:30 .@jkenney says on @630CHED that it is “linear thinking engineers” in our oil companies and their government relations consultants that allowed reputations damage to the industry. Interestingly, he panders to these engineers for donations and hired all their consultants #AbLeg

4186 2018-12-05 17:58:04 my current wip is a mystery/gothic novel but the other day I got an idea for a children's book I'd love to do.  I work in all mediums, my favorite is oil paint though cause blending is easier and smoother, at least for me lol
4187 2018-12-05 17:57:59 This is what I been hollering about since last night. The cake is a point of professional hilarity and ridiculousness. But I need to know where all that oil went and who pocketed the money and how that affected what I've been paying for gas for the last 5 yrs.
4188 2018-12-05 17:57:56 Sorry sir our leaders duties are to work according to our intrests not yours
We will keep the oil market balance according to reasonable prices for our budgets
4189 2018-12-05 17:57:54 Problem is we have $53.00 oil and $3.35 gasoline and $3.75 diesel.  The oil companies are screwing the people. Plain and simple. Help!!!!!
4190 2018-12-05 17:57:49 Don't mind the idiots,by the time Yahoo guys scams him,he will know
4191 2018-12-05 17:57:44 Sometimes I ask myself, what would happen if oil was discovered in Jamaican waters? Don't think we could handle it. We don't seem to be able to manage the imported one. Sigh....
4192 2018-12-05 17:57:41 I need to read this report properly; is it crude oil that is missing or by-products of refinery of crude oil?
4193 2018-12-05 17:57:31 Why does an oil change take more than 2 hours 
4194 2018-12-05 17:57:28 Young Nigerians, sit still for a sec and imagine a future where the EV Auto revolution has passed and there are more electric powered vehicles worldwide(road, train, machinery) than fuel powered ones. Think what it will mean for our oil based economy...
4195 2018-12-05 17:57:25 Unfortunately, the millions being spent eulogizing Bush could feed hundreds of thousands of American poverty stricken children. Not a great man, and responsible for protecting Kuwaiti oil with American treasure and blood.
4196 2018-12-05 17:57:16 My mom called me to say:
“I know you smoke weed, but can’t you just take some oil or eat a piece of cake instead?” 
 little does she know oils and edibles get me RIPPED 
4197 2018-12-05 17:57:09 Look at it this way: the oil was only supposed to give light for one night. Instead, it miraculously burned for 8. 

You’re way ahead.

4200 2018-12-05 17:56:59 Investing in renewables will keep the oil prices down. Lets not forget that Saudi Arabia killed Khashoggi and we are still waiting for you to listen to the tapes.
4201 2018-12-05 17:56:49 Give up your heat, fuel, car, computer, then come talk to us!
Hypocrites who bash us. Yet you get excited when GM closes ONE plant in Ont? We lose 2.5 plants per month out here.
If there was money in alternative fuels, OIL COMPANIES would own the market.
Diversify into what?
4202 2018-12-05 17:56:48 I got coconut oil today
4203 2018-12-05 17:56:47 Option #1, but olive oil and garlic salt.
4204 2018-12-05 17:56:41 I grew up in a farming family, where we would literally come home with our jeans splashed with mud, oil and animal crap. I've just carried over the habit of washing jeans with nearly every use.

4207 2018-12-05 17:56:31 TBH a lot of haters drag @afowler06 for repping CBD oil but would you rather see him repping an energy drink??

I'm honestly tired of seeing atheletes rep energy drinks those things are poison. I get people are just ragging for fun but still

4211 2018-12-05 17:56:22 & how is halving oil production going to help? My point is that “putting pressure on oil companies” is a negative populist move. Est. the right infrastructure to allow for less consumption is the positive move. Sirota is a populist, leveraging the crisis that we are facing.
4212 2018-12-05 17:56:17 Yep , except Canada is the # 1 supplier of oil to the USA and they just cut production .  You know the country that was not where the 9/11 terrorists came from and does not kill US residents and does not fund terrorism , the country you treated like shit .
4213 2018-12-05 17:56:10 But there are not enough Liberal seats in Alberta, so why care?? If oil was in Quebec we would have too many pipelines...

4216 2018-12-05 17:56:00 Irrelevant now....This collapse in the price of oil has now forced OPEC to cut production into a tightening market. We will see prices higher in Q1 and Q2.
4217 2018-12-05 17:55:50 Tea tree oil is everything
4218 2018-12-05 17:55:42 France taxed gasoline for climate reasons (good!)

The taxes only affected the price the customer pays, rather than charging the oil company (bad!)

Lefties and righties both hated it, luckily it looks like the movement is majority leftist at the moment (vvv good!)
4219 2018-12-05 17:55:41 He's like the crude oil added to fresh water.

4221 2018-12-05 17:55:32 Inflation doubled during his time, as well as the price of oil. Proposed mandatory healthcare and supported single payer. Did nothing to change the 70% tax rate on high income earners, in fact supported more. Increases SS rate. In a lot of ways you could say he was Obama lite
4222 2018-12-05 17:55:30 I never said don't scrutinize Beto. Just don't assume he's bought by oil & gas when his voting record says otherwise.

Bernie got his start w/NRA funding, voted against the Brady bill, etc., etc.
4223 2018-12-05 17:55:27 The brake oil....Oshoke you're too silly 
4224 2018-12-05 17:55:27 I very very long baby oil bath in your house using this crazy thing you've got a loaded one of the OEMs
4225 2018-12-05 17:55:24 helping the disadvantaged doesn't anger me but giving millions in tax holder money to oil companies to fortune 500 companies for NO reason, forcing Canada post back to work when all their asking for is more than 60% of their pay if they get injured on the job, that angers me!
4226 2018-12-05 17:55:21 We get most of our oil from Canada. As Russia and Saudi Arabia work together we will see corruption and rising oil price. You have nothing to do with the price of oil. You are not a hero.
4227 2018-12-05 17:55:17 @AmyGoodman_DN of interest to you: Hill Knowlton received  $10.8 million from the CFK & the Kuwait gov. for the coaching of Nayirah. Saud Nasir Al- Sabah was rewarded with cabinet positions, first as ministry of information, then ministry of oil.
4228 2018-12-05 17:55:15 The current @GOP led House Science Committee reads like a press release from big oil, ag, mining, logging, & money —

4229 2018-12-05 17:55:08 So a former one-term president passing away is enough to earn multiple "image hashtags" plus the closing of financial and government institutions. For a man who manipulated a drug war, conducted an oil war, and ignored a worldwide health epidemic. SMDH
4230 2018-12-05 17:55:03 How can you like as a person the guy responsible for the Highway of Death? That’s not a policy disagreement, Bush sent us deliberately into war at the behest of oil profiteers. Desert Storm was a test of public appetite for military conflict post-Vietnam w/ catastrophic results.
4231 2018-12-05 17:55:02 It is trading flat, as PIKs don’t count and, whilst next payment is probably in cash, it’s not certain. Unless oil price gets stronger, payments after that will be in PIKs.

4233 2018-12-05 17:54:56 Quick reminder that oil and gas companies poisoned the planet with leaded gasoline in the 20th century, staunchly defended it for decades, and if given the chance, would have absolutely kept killing us all for profit.

4238 2018-12-05 17:54:38 Oil prices remained weak, amid signs of swelling U.S. inventories, though losses were limited as traders continued to weigh prospects of a coordinated production cut among major global oil producers ahead of this week's OPEC meeting.
4239 2018-12-05 17:54:37 There is a Liability report that ALL oil and gas companies are on. ALL of their wells are on in. If your wells and Facilities are shut in it shows as a Negative Liability. If you have a Negative Liabilty then you Can’t drill or Buy more Land to Drill that forces them to address
4240 2018-12-05 17:54:35 Thank goodness. 1979, three mile island drives nuclear costs up, and oil shocks drive use of coal. Since then wind and solar have replaced much of the demand. Question is can they replace quickly enough to insulate from another energy shock.
4241 2018-12-05 17:54:33 I been needed that lit oil change
4242 2018-12-05 17:54:32 Or oil in general.
4243 2018-12-05 17:54:27 Opinion: The USA is keen on forcing oil and gas firms to replace the gas flaring process with Gas To Liquid technology. Which will make the USA export more crude oil. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @FLOTUS @TeamTrump
4244 2018-12-05 17:54:22 or that anyone besides the very rich had the free time or lamp oil for "hobbies," full stop.
4245 2018-12-05 17:54:05 Need some oil
4246 2018-12-05 17:54:00 TSSA is grossly understaffed and underresouced for the important safety role they are supposed to play. Fun media question: ask them the # of home heating oil tanks vs # of inspectors in the province. These and pipelines are essentially self regulated, TSSA staff not enough.

4253 2018-12-05 17:53:24 Thank you President Trump - ( Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted.) We will see oil price is going down on the way  to 40$
4254 2018-12-05 17:53:18 Stretching shouldn’t be painful if it is ya gotta wait another week or so and use jajoba or vitamin E oil
4255 2018-12-05 17:53:10 The attack politics of this company do not fit my personal ethics.  These idiots are a bunch of hypocrites! They’ll take our/my “dirty oil money” but advocate against the pipelines!!
4256 2018-12-05 17:53:02 And I can supply the baby oil... we could be on for a winner here.
4257 2018-12-05 17:52:54 Sure, if you ignore the inevitable catastrophic destruction of the ecosystem in the harbour when the stuff spills. Unlike oil, bitumen sinks, and since there is no binding agreement saying otherwise, it will be BC that gets stuck with the bill for the attempts at damage control.

I have a hard time with media and DC snobs rejecting him in the 80’s as not being able to fit in as they were controlled by oil& corporate interests... his intelligence, heart,dignity & compassion proved them wrong.

4267 2018-12-05 17:52:06 Way to pay respects to #GHWB, imbecile.

Btw, oil is a finite resource. It’s inevitable that prices will be astronomical once it’s all been tapped. What then? We need to be implementing renewable energy sources across the board!
4268 2018-12-05 17:51:55 I remember my friends and I deciding, upon seeing the riot police shields and tear gas canisters, that while we firmly believed No Blood For Oil, we also believed our mothers Would Not bail us out of jail so we skedaddled. Live to fight another day...
4269 2018-12-05 17:51:51 The presentation of the data was poorly worded. "Beto is #2 recipient of oil & gas money", suggests he's getting money from the industry, and not from individuals employed by that industry. Is it important that a CEO gave Beto $2700? Dunno. Did the CEO get a meeting from it?
4270 2018-12-05 17:51:46 also couldn't unhear '20 times 20 times ...........' during give me oil in my lamp
4271 2018-12-05 17:51:38  stop already. Please pictures photos of this event! Trudeau saying he said does not make it so! His big sanctions the ones in prison cannot come to Canada! But carrying on, we will give $17.BILLION for your oil and leave our own in the ground. Arms deal stays.

4280 2018-12-05 17:51:12 World’s largest oil producer trying to keep oil prices down. What’s that all about?
4281 2018-12-05 17:51:11 This oil change is taking forever At this point I don’t even want my tires rotated any more. Just slide me my keys
4282 2018-12-05 17:51:10 LOL! I may have been a bit early (May), but I picked a great year to flip bearish. 

It was pure luck though, since I probably would have flipped in 2016 had I known then what I know now, and gotten run over all year 2017. 

Watching oil crumble is bullish for my love life IYKWIM
4283 2018-12-05 17:51:02 Most oil and gas is shipped by pipelines. They are by far the safest, most economical, and environmentally effective way to move the materials around. Pipelines are also the most highly regulated and monitored method used for oil and gas transfers.

4285 2018-12-05 17:50:59 Bernie is the snake oil Jane is selling.  And she has made a pretty profit, for her whole family.

4295 2018-12-05 17:50:28 Steaming vegetables is a disservice to all vegetables and, I believe, why so many people have grown up hating vegetables. Olive oil and garlic for the win.
4296 2018-12-05 17:50:23 A lot of it comes with learning coping methods that actually work for you, I’ve struggled with severe anxiety for a long time (meds don’t work) and although you can’t stop it finding coping methods for those periods where you feel that way does help immensely!

4299 2018-12-05 17:50:16 @jkenney is on @ABDanielleSmith lighting a fire under the asses of oil and gas ceos in Alberta. 
GREAT JOB!! 
I would also like to see some criminal investigations into “canadians” taking money from over seas economic terrorists that have sabotaged our economy.
@FairQuestions
4300 2018-12-05 17:50:11 here we all do tht alot fri many food eaten like tht,even cod liver oil is like tht
4301 2018-12-05 17:50:11 Tea tree oil shampoo & conditioner
4302 2018-12-05 17:50:08 More Tufty Club snake oil...
4303 2018-12-05 17:50:03 The French people forced Macron to bow to their demands not to increase taxes on oil and raise salaries to the French people
4304 2018-12-05 17:50:01 MBS is the son, (AHEM, oil and $$), putin never had. So it has been written. So it shall be conveyed.
4305 2018-12-05 17:49:58 Obama laid off thousands in the OIL&Energy in Wyoming and tried to shut down MEAT & OIL industries in Texas, Gov Abbott didn’t let him mess with Texas..
Trump is creating thousands of jobs, after tax cuts, small business started booming and hiring
4306 2018-12-05 17:49:57 and they are charging proper taxes for the exploitation of the oil rather than lacing their old classmates' pockets with the oil revenue
4307 2018-12-05 17:49:47 I roast it in the oven, tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with a BBQ style rub.

4309 2018-12-05 17:49:40 .@HouseGOP has spent the last 2 yrs trying to take away people’s healthcare, gut food stamps for kids & seniors, & sell off our public lands to big oil. 
 
I can’t wait for Jan 3rd, when we will finally have a Congress that sticks up for everyday Americans & protects our planet.

Fact Check - if want to do something useful discuss over $20 trillion in welfare to corporate welfare queen parasites since Reagan became President - combine federal gov, state govs, local govs - banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, electricity, Comcast, Apple, Nestle, etc
4311 2018-12-05 17:49:33 Bottom-line: Anything and EVERYTHING for ... OIL!
4312 2018-12-05 17:49:30 Got my mum to try CBD oil for the first time today for her joint pain. Will let you know how it goes!
4313 2018-12-05 17:49:27 What effect does this have on domestic oil producers?
4314 2018-12-05 17:49:17 Top Beard Tips: beard oil is primarily to help keep the skin under your beard hydrated and healthy; use fingertips to work oil into beard and skin and then shape with a good wooden beard comb.
4315 2018-12-05 17:49:15 Reminds me of Saddam Hussein setting fire to all the oil wells as he retreated from Kuwait.
4316 2018-12-05 17:49:14 Forgiving #Khassogi's death merely for lowering price of oil in international market is very stupid and inhuman act
4317 2018-12-05 17:49:12 Wow you just posted your ignorance! Bill C 48 the tanker ban on the export of oil and refined products from NE BC. Bill C 69 which adds extra hurdles to resource projects such as “intersection of sex and gender” test and accounting of downstream emissions which consumers control
4318 2018-12-05 17:49:08 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
4319 2018-12-05 17:49:08 How howie it’s still gonna be a HARD PASS on Beto. Voted to deregulate banks, took money from top oil and gas people, voted to increase trumps war budget THREE F*cking Times, and is not for Medicare4all. And that is just a start on why it’s never Beto. Keep your white obama. 
4320 2018-12-05 17:49:03 Let's just get our oil changed and mind our own business!
4321 2018-12-05 17:49:01 I'm Italian, I'm using olive oil, it's fine.
4322 2018-12-05 17:48:56 Thanks for promoting sustainable energy to help relieve our independence on foreign oil ..... oh wait,  that was the previous and better qualified executive.  Oops
4323 2018-12-05 17:48:45 Read recently that just 16 oil tankers produce more pollution than all the cars in the world. Now times that by 1000's of ships then there's aircraft. Yet its car owners that get blamed,penalised & pay the price while large business make profit.
4324 2018-12-05 17:48:44 Blue magic,Royal crown and the Pink oil moisturizer. ....
4325 2018-12-05 17:48:37 -Use olive oil in your food as it prevents heart disease and regulates cholesterol;
-Eat fish and sea food at least 2 times a week. Fish is really rich protein and on omega 3, what is really good for your health;
4326 2018-12-05 17:48:36 Run on the rooftops
Gun past the blue cops
What Ive done,
Don't look back,
Can't stop, cuts off
Heats up and it's so hot
Bars come quick enough
Hell gates slam shut
Devil's bargain
Devil's bangin on the door
I done enough, lemme off
Oil lips, breath hot
Devil's beggin for more
4327 2018-12-05 17:48:24 Oil will not be allowed to go up, until it does. If one can think longer than this Friday, this little take down is wildly bullish for oil (hope it continues).
4328 2018-12-05 17:48:23 Oil. Money.
4329 2018-12-05 17:48:10 Elsewhere in the world- youth are marching & asking for action on climate change. Yet Alberta keeps its head in the sand & is only focused on the oil. Interesting that Kenney never talks about diversifying the economy,which must happen. Easier to blame Trudeau than seek solutions
4330 2018-12-05 17:48:10 thank you Mr. President..   the oil market has always been a scam.. they always stolen from us.
4331 2018-12-05 17:48:05 Hopefully we won’t have to overlook any more dead journalists to get cheap oil prices
4332 2018-12-05 17:47:54 isn't balsamic vinaigrette just olive oil with other stuff in it?

what you need is a different oil. i prefer peanut
4333 2018-12-05 17:47:52 It made my skin even more oily. The oil then resulted in major breakouts  It was bad  But I’ve got a friend who uses the very same products and it’s working magic on her skin… flawless !! It all depends on your skin, don’t take people’s options too much
4334 2018-12-05 17:47:52 Why I Started Tearing Up While Getting an Oil Change Today: a thread
4335 2018-12-05 17:47:49 Good one Mr Jha! Hope @amitmalviya will also enjoy! Hope @GVLNRAO also cheer up! After all how long will they keep a caster oil face!
4336 2018-12-05 17:47:43 If I was OPEC I would do exactly that. Announce small production cuts, let oil tank again, bankrupt the US shale industry, make OPEC great again, Drive US into recession, and have the US own them a favor! Well played, That's one way to keep inflation low for another few months.
4337 2018-12-05 17:47:41 Got a bad craving for fresh dukkah and good crusty bread and olive oil. 
#dukkah #timetomakestuff
4338 2018-12-05 17:47:40 3 eggs scrambled in coconut oil, avocado cut in half, sliced in skin topped with balsamic vinegar.
4339 2018-12-05 17:47:39 Oh good lord. That is so idiotic I’m not even offended. I used to work for a law firm with many, many oil business clients. They had those clients because - guess what? - the firm was in Houston, Texas, where there are many, many oil companies. Does that make me a Nazi, too?
4340 2018-12-05 17:47:36 No no no, the cure for climate change is to drill more, frack more, and pump more oil through more pipelines! The earth is heading for a brick wall, so push the gas pedal harder!
4341 2018-12-05 17:47:35 rape seed oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, ...
4342 2018-12-05 17:47:25 *pours a 55-gallon drum of oil into casket*
4343 2018-12-05 17:47:24 Guess what Scruffy..not the Oil doing this...more like the Flames that you hate so much. Sports Cage the official "Oilers" station? Lots of Sask people do not like the Oilers.
4344 2018-12-05 17:47:22 Guy, what implications if Oil revisits 25? Great show @CNBCFastMoney
4345 2018-12-05 17:47:20 So cool!! Let’s go Oil!! #12DaysOfRogersPlace
4346 2018-12-05 17:47:19 Wow thx guys. I’ll def try this ... u think I could use a Avocado oil?
4347 2018-12-05 17:47:19 Tears of oil
4348 2018-12-05 17:47:09 And as for the Isis loving Khashoggi Trump did not say he he believed him, he dosent want to them to turn to Russia for their oil.. Which by the way keeps your gas prices down and more money in your pocket.
4349 2018-12-05 17:47:04 The POINT of OPEC is to restrict oil to keep the price where THEY want it. They are CURRENTLY restricting the price of oil ya dolt.
4350 2018-12-05 17:47:01 Take a look at other economies.  Low prices are great, but there are broader far reaching economics to consider.  Oil companies that own their own refineries and oil production facilities are cashing in as gas futures remain higher than what a barrel of oil suggests it should be.
4351 2018-12-05 17:46:59 Was able to leave work early and have accomplished a lot. Oil change, air in my tires, paid rent, painted nails. Treating myself to Wallace Station for lunch and then heading off to see The Struts tonight!!
4352 2018-12-05 17:46:53 Top polymer clay pieces are painted with acrylic and the background is oil paint
4353 2018-12-05 17:46:51 Roast it in the oven with just olive oil.
4354 2018-12-05 17:46:47 Silly Macron, all you have to do is sanction the murder/dismemberment of a journalist and oil prices go way down!
4355 2018-12-05 17:46:45 The amount of products made from oil and gas are staggering. Most people don’t even realize the magnitude of the scope of the products you’re referring to.
4356 2018-12-05 17:46:44 Roasted Brussel Spouts work too. I recommend splitting them, brush with olive oil, salt & pepper. Can't stand them any other way.
4357 2018-12-05 17:46:38 Bakken discoveries 1950s. Drilling begins~2005. Oul@production booming. Glut in market 2011-2012 during Obama tenure. 500k jobs lost. Obama did not a damn thing but regulate. Oil production up despite his administration not bc if it. President of Shell Oil called Obama out. Facts
4358 2018-12-05 17:46:34 Everyone recommended balsamic vinaigrette to me as an alternative to olive oil but it didn't taste nearly as good.
4359 2018-12-05 17:46:28 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
4360 2018-12-05 17:46:28 Drop all palm oil and replace it with... ?

4362 2018-12-05 17:46:19 We can choose different paths now through devolved powers-whilst having benefit of pooling & sharing in good times, with a safety net in bad as so vividly demonstrated during banking crash and oil slump. Best of both worlds. What is it about life here you don’t like?
4363 2018-12-05 17:46:10 comparer un pick up même un mercos à la finition et au luxe d'un série G moteur V8 à 150000€!!! 
10500 € pour un PU de 27000€ cela fait 38% de taxe! Une mesure faites par et pour les riches, puisque ce malus représente 0.5% d'une Bugatti!!
4364 2018-12-05 17:46:10 Obama really said hes proud of the Paris climate agreement and then bragged about increasing US oil production to an all time high. His supporters are some of the most brainwashed people
4365 2018-12-05 17:46:10 what about YPG Kurds etchnic cleansing of others to expand its territory.. They targeted oil rich areas and kicked poor local people out by gun force
4366 2018-12-05 17:46:06 Broccoli two ways: steam it for 60 or so seconds in a covered pot with an inch of boiling water, till bright green but still crisp. Drain, add butter, lemon, salt. 

Or: roast stovetop in a cast iron pan in olive oil with chopped garlic. Add lemon. Perfect.
4367 2018-12-05 17:46:03 “When you’re a star...”
4368 2018-12-05 17:46:01 It is Now a days. With No Market for our Gas or Oil, compaines are now going broke and don’t have the money to do these themselves, which gets turned over to the Orphan fund. When Prices are low, Companies are forced to shut in their Wells because it cost them money to produce

4370 2018-12-05 17:45:48 We are ready to move him back to daura or mail wherever he come's from i am always servicing my PVC with groundnut oil and white handkerchief
4371 2018-12-05 17:45:47 GLAMOUR: Always use a massage oil.
4372 2018-12-05 17:45:45 Charlie do you think that all this was just to protect Obama Clinton from the opening of Uranium 1? His whole approach to “Collision”doesn’t make sense. It looks like he is drilling a oil well that is an empty hole. Nothing?
4373 2018-12-05 17:45:41 What do you think the impacts would being Qatar begins looking on non-oil index pricing for LNG now that it has left OPEC? Any effect to the price of oil? Stability in the region?
4374 2018-12-05 17:45:40 Obama laid off thousands in the OIL&Energy in Wyoming and tried to shut down MEAT & OIL industries in Texas, Gov Abbott didn’t let him mess with Texas..

4377 2018-12-05 17:45:29 Olive oil, ( you can add a nob of butter also) and Nigella seeds.
4378 2018-12-05 17:45:22 Many of the $TSLAQ folks are rivals of Tesla or somewhere in the ecosystem (like dealerships, Lidar manufactuers, oil and gas executives) that have a lot to lose if Tesla rises. They won’t change, until change comes to them, taking them away kicking and screaming.
4379 2018-12-05 17:45:15 You do realize we do not depend on OPEC for oil. Right.
4380 2018-12-05 17:45:15 it was clean-ish yesterday. Somebody keeps creating a halo of frying oil stains, my attempt to create a cleaning schedule for the entire house has barely given results... I have deadlines I can't be dealing with this or going to the store to buy meals that don't need to be cooked
4381 2018-12-05 17:45:08 Please remember President George bush established the acid rain act and the clean air and reduces fossil fuel burning and pollution. You want to drill for oil in pristine Alaska and in the New York Times that you are pushing it. Please stop this and push alternative energy
4382 2018-12-05 17:45:04 #1 buy Canadian oil, it's less than half the price

#2 you are at a funeral, get off your phone

#3 I don't think you even know what the price at the pumps are

#4 we are headed towards another recession, and the stock market lost 800 points yesterday. Be concerned about that!
4383 2018-12-05 17:44:55 @KitchenAid_CA Does the new metal meat grinder have the same problem as the old one where oil leaks into the meat?
4384 2018-12-05 17:44:53 Tap ALASKA LET THEM EAT OIL
4385 2018-12-05 17:44:50 The longer that oil prices stay low, the less incentives we have to switch to renewable energy sources. We need to end subsidies for oil companies and put them in place for renewable energy companies and consumers.
4386 2018-12-05 17:44:45 Never. I always fry them as you did because we like the skin to be crispy. Whole ones I oven bake with a pine nut & herb stuffing, sprinkled with olive oil, lemon juice, seasoning and some white breadcrumbs on top.
4387 2018-12-05 17:44:38 Ya we're all trying to be healthy here. No one wants to read your social media novel about freebasing avocado oil and improperly reading tarot cards
4388 2018-12-05 17:44:32 Take your oil
4389 2018-12-05 17:44:30 PLEASE do not speak for the WORLD and what is good for it. We need HIGHER prices which include all damages that are made by oil pollution. Only in this way we can swap to renewable energy. This is what the world, the globe and our kids want.
4390 2018-12-05 17:44:30 If we were not so dependent on oil, why would this matter?
4391 2018-12-05 17:44:28 You do understand that 40% of our oil comes from Canada don't you ? You know the country to the north of us?  The country that used to be one of our close allies?
4392 2018-12-05 17:44:22 Needed this oil change cause girrrrl 
4393 2018-12-05 17:44:22 Just keep blowing the crown prince and oil will keep cuming
4394 2018-12-05 17:44:21 In today’s gig announcements: Toto, The Gipsy Kings, Midnight Oil
4395 2018-12-05 17:44:17 Why are you so afraid of renewable energy, anyway?

Take away everything else and Oil is still finite. Best to drop it sooner than later.
4396 2018-12-05 17:44:16 High oil prices are exactly what Putin wants.
And so does his new BFF Mohammed Bone Saw
4397 2018-12-05 17:44:07 hope they both washed their hands and applied holy oil
4398 2018-12-05 17:44:01 TIL that when #cooking adding oil to boiling pasta is a nono. Also salt should be added post boiling and the water should have the salt level of a cup of ocean water? 
4399 2018-12-05 17:43:54 Looks like they have discovered oil in Paris
4400 2018-12-05 17:43:51 Hope nobody tells the Telegraph that Norway did not squander all its oil and gas revenues or reserves  and is practically 100% sufficient in energy from wind farms and hydroelectricity. it also has the highest state savings of any country outside Saudi Arabia. Filthy rich.
4401 2018-12-05 17:43:46 It is necessary to stop subsidizing fossil fuels at the very least to level the playing field. In consideration of oil’s extreme political power, it will probably also be necessary to fund #GreenNewDeal initiatives, again, just to level the playing field.
4402 2018-12-05 17:43:39 Oil production up despite his administration. Not Bc of it.
4403 2018-12-05 17:43:36 this oil change is taking way too long
4404 2018-12-05 17:43:32 I hope she's wearing a cross and has some anointing oil in her pocket.  Need to go through decontamination afterwards.
4405 2018-12-05 17:43:23 @arrivaessex it would be fantastic if your buses ran properly 1st bus last week ran out of Oil yes OIL!!!!!!  Now scheduled bus is not going all the way randomly out of service so i have to walk 3 miles in the pissing rain..to say im VEX is an understatement!!
4406 2018-12-05 17:43:16 So we just gonna sit here and act like the Bush family is so great, and was not part of all kinds of evil and corruption and oil greed... Oh okay. I guess.
4407 2018-12-05 17:43:11 Anyone know of a soap or shower gel that doesn’t contain coconut oil?

Not black soap though...
4408 2018-12-05 17:43:10 How about oil tariffs?
4409 2018-12-05 17:43:03 bring some oil back for me thanks
4410 2018-12-05 17:43:03 I got a concussion that way. I was putting in oil when the hood support thing gave way. You should get checked out to make sure
4411 2018-12-05 17:43:00 K St Healthcare Lobbyist and former @DNC chair @GovHowardDean is tweeting about @BetoORourke. That's got to be a kiss of death. Beto doesn't support #MedicareForAll, is beholden to oil+gas co's and Wall St. Hard pass.
4412 2018-12-05 17:42:37 It seems they think numbers donot Support cut so as you. But trade war stopped the Chinese buying of US oil which resulting the invent. Figures of US kept high, on which the traders depend mainly.
4413 2018-12-05 17:42:33 And yet Keyamo's head rufuses to produce oil.

Is this not TwoDerfull? 
4414 2018-12-05 17:42:31 This heat is illegal and its all the fault of oil fuckers
4415 2018-12-05 17:42:29 Me too l started researching coz l wanted oil for my hair. . It's truly the best thing for the skin.
4416 2018-12-05 17:42:29 El consorcio conformado por Talos Energy, Sierra Oil y Premier arrancó la perforación del pozo Zama-2, en la cual estima invertir 250 millones, con potencial de 450 millones de barriles de petróleo crudo equivalente,dos pozos, un pozo paralelo y la penetración de tres depósitos.
4417 2018-12-05 17:42:26 You do know how electricity is made  by burning coal and oil though right?
4418 2018-12-05 17:42:13 Opinion: China wants gas flaring/flare stack a thing of the past for the oil & gas industry. Saying the process is a wasteful practice. @KingSalman @HHShkMohd @HamdanMohammed @TamimBinHamad @MBA_AlThani_ @ChinaSPIC @CGTNOfficial
4419 2018-12-05 17:42:11 Obama laid off thousands in the OIL&Energy in Wyoming and tried to shut down MEAT & OIL industries in Texas, Gov Abbott didn’t let him mess with Texas..
Trump is creating thousands of jobs, after tax cuts, small business started booming and hiring
4420 2018-12-05 17:42:09 I have to ease up on the MCT oil. No point now really. #keto #ketogenicdiet
4421 2018-12-05 17:42:02 Think about a bag of chips (You should get this). You reach in and grab chips.  As the bag empties, there are still broken chips in the bottom.  So, you pinch crumbs each time you want more.  The world can't be turned up-side-down and shaken to empty the last little bit of oil.
4422 2018-12-05 17:42:02 Bless you ,I know we all on same boat  use heat for rib pain ,gp didn't go for icepack due to nerve damage as would make it worse ,trying to get CBD oil but so far consultant not responded  thank you x
4423 2018-12-05 17:42:02 Exactly. Im pretty divided in this issue. Oil is partly what makes America rich but it’s also harmful. Also the fact that progressives use climate change as a Trojan horse for their anti-capitalistic agenda. It’s complicated man.
4424 2018-12-05 17:42:02 Starchy Carb rich potatoes deep fried in unhealthy oil..  and people wonder why many people are over weight. .
4425 2018-12-05 17:42:00 I’ve decided what to paint next. It will be an acrylic of Weymouth sea front looking across part of the beach. I also am prepping an oil which is a street view of Weymouth, but I will do that one later. I’ve got a London Thames scene part prepped as well.
4426 2018-12-05 17:42:00 Great eulogy to the most accomplished men in American history Navy World War II fighter pilot distinguished flying cross went home made money and oil became a congressman CIA director vice president president wow that is amazing they don't make them like this generation anymore
4427 2018-12-05 17:41:53 This indomie relish is a fail sha. Also did they like put seasoned palm oil as one of the sauces
4428 2018-12-05 17:41:52 Please stop talking like you understand oil markets.  You don't.  If I have a question about money laundering through real estate I will listen to what you have to say.
4429 2018-12-05 17:41:43 IMHO this is kinda funny, silly really, but I’m in. Do the math. Beto raised +/-$100million for Senate run.  That’s a WOW. Apparently oil/gas industry folk gave him a combined +/- $500K. Or - wait for it - around 1/2% of total raised. Definitely in their pocket & scandal???
4430 2018-12-05 17:41:35 Foreign investment in Canada is decreasing, oil and auto production decreasing, GDP decreasing, but carbon taxes and rhetoric are going up.
4431 2018-12-05 17:41:27 you're both wrong, olive oil has way too low of a smoke point for roasting
4432 2018-12-05 17:41:25 Probably not but never count out Jerry who is big boxing fan and them old oil fields pockets LOL
4433 2018-12-05 17:41:20 Read up on where our oil comes from.
4434 2018-12-05 17:41:17 We'd like to see you brodcast this in ARABIC to your AJ home countries which produce OIL and GAS destroying the Earth, polluting our bodies. All your wealth comes from it, from nothing else. And probably you most of all are sabotaging the slightest shift away from it. #Liars
4435 2018-12-05 17:41:10 Today's lunch menu: Garlic & Balsamic Marinated Pork. Chicken with Charred Lemon Sauce. Wild Arugula Salad with Manchego, Toasted Pumpkin Seeds & Red Wine Vinaigrette. Smashed Carrots with Lemon Oil & Tarragon. Roasted Baba Ganoush Salad. Toasted Rice with Mixed Mushrooms.
4436 2018-12-05 17:41:03 Alaskans want the price of oil to be in the $100 range. Just saying ;)
4437 2018-12-05 17:41:00 i ate olive oil pasta yesterday and already there’s a pimple on my chin... such is life
4438 2018-12-05 17:41:00 Aloe Vera oil
4439 2018-12-05 17:40:58 Indeed! Aren't the SNP set to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030? I wonder if they propose also banning the extraction of oil and gas too? After all, they need to be consistent. Otherwise surely they can be accused of hypocrisy - with justification. #virtuesignalling
4440 2018-12-05 17:40:56 There actually is a tremendous amount of oil at the North Pole but no one has been able to figure out how to get to it
4441 2018-12-05 17:40:51 Or just get rid of oil and stop killing people who find alternate options
4442 2018-12-05 17:40:49 Worked in oil for over a decade. Obama has absolutely nothing. Nada. To do with increased oil production. Study the Bakken. You are clueless.
4443 2018-12-05 17:40:44 Roasting > steamed, w/olive oil especially, but steamed vegetables are still Good.
4444 2018-12-05 17:40:40 He started an unnessary war that killed over 5,000 American troops and 100,000’s of thousand Iraqi’s. Be careful what you wish for! I hate trump as much as u but these Bush’s are in it for the oil money.
4445 2018-12-05 17:40:36 President Trump may think the US will sell more oil as a result, if it hasn’t been explained how expensive it is to switch a refinery to accept different crudes. That would be an issue. Otherwise, I agree. RG could also use small boat swarm tactics to seed mines ahead of vessels.
4446 2018-12-05 17:40:32 OMG this interview is WICKED!!!  Billy Big Boys!!! Mr D could u tell that dislocated finger story on a Bedtime Insta Live please & do the actions I couldn’t quite hear it or see it properly...Please & do I’ll get some Coconut Oil in ! #TastesBetterThanVaselineorLube X
4447 2018-12-05 17:40:30 でもウルフってちょっとカッコいいよなーあっいや一番カッコいいのはハンターだけどな！
4448 2018-12-05 17:40:27 $60 oil is good for everyone.  Not expensive at gas pump and producers can make money.  If you want a tax cut for Americans do the hard work with Congress.  Don’t do it at the expense of one of our decent American industries
4449 2018-12-05 17:40:18 I mean, there will always be nice things that we could do with money from oil, but when is enough enough? When can we say we’ll leave it in the ground?
4450 2018-12-05 17:40:12 canada produces oil at 70$ per barrel production cost. this is why they are packing in
4451 2018-12-05 17:40:12 Fact: The US is the leading oil producer in the world right now. If prices go up it's on Trumplestiltskins & his pork stuffing buddies not OPEC. He's just setting the table for his next big scam on America. #TrumpLies #FactsMatter
4452 2018-12-05 17:40:10 I’m torn. He did an amazing job in the fear of Russian and US nuclear war. He also started the whole invade the Middle East for our and his oil interest. Raised a war criminal. Honestly tho he wasn’t the worst president by far.
4453 2018-12-05 17:40:10 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
4454 2018-12-05 17:40:07 AND the open passage through the Suez canal that continues to this day. Oil -$50
4455 2018-12-05 17:40:05 no. it should be, but isnt, unfortunately. Centrists are down to drop 26k bombs per year for oil and arms sales. Hell, Obama attacked native americans on their own land for an oil company. There’s nothing moderate about that.
4456 2018-12-05 17:39:58 Exactly!! Why did we need to conserve when all we had to do was invade middle eastern (predominantly Muslim) countries and steal their oil?!?
4457 2018-12-05 17:39:55 It is a good first step. It is too bad they did not protest during Harper’s tenure as PM. Harper had nine years in office and could not build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing land locked Alberta oil. Harper’s epic failure will haunt Alberta for a generation
4458 2018-12-05 17:39:51 Terrible take. Never steam anything that you can roast with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
4459 2018-12-05 17:39:48 BP's annual report on proved global oil reserves says that as of the end of 2013, Earth has nearly 1.688 trillion barrels of crude, which will last 53.3 years at current rates of extraction. This figure is 1.1 percent higher than that of the previous year.
4460 2018-12-05 17:39:46 Hey who would of guessed trump hates the pice of high oil, I would figure he can afford all the friggin oil he wants if he really wanted to he could invest in oil heavily and then cause a trade wa causing the price of oil to sky rocket making him even more money 
4461 2018-12-05 17:39:42 How you lost a barrel a oil???????? #PetrojamReport
4462 2018-12-05 17:39:39 Thought experiment...what if oil prices go up but spot gold stays ~$1200?  Mining investors will be none too happy.   Even if oil prices fall, it won’t be much help as most miners are barely making a profit now. Just sayin’. $DUST $JDST
4463 2018-12-05 17:39:39 @foe_us wow fracking chemicals certainly must be bad for one's cognitive abilities drink some oil mister tell us about it!
4464 2018-12-05 17:39:23 Can do an oil change. No problem. Pretty easy.
4465 2018-12-05 17:39:21 And North Dakota - between soybean basis falling apart and oil price declines, I'm guessing they're the hardest hit state in the union since the administration started

4467 2018-12-05 17:39:14 Why does soil rhyme with oil
4468 2018-12-05 17:39:13 Happy Birthday! We love great olive oil & balsamic vinegar at every age! 
4469 2018-12-05 17:39:08 Does oil recessions count
4470 2018-12-05 17:39:00 You’re mistaken again orange boy. OPEC nations are quite happy to see oil prices rise. It is litterally the way they make money. You are a terrible business person aren’t you.
4471 2018-12-05 17:38:59 Most of the oil used by the US is drilled in our country. What OPEC does has very little impact on the US.
4472 2018-12-05 17:38:57 I agree Electric cars are attractive, several fluids needed by ordinary cars for brakes, transmission and coolant make regular cars rolling toxin distributors, beyond gas and oil.  Maintenance is also very low for electrics.  Electrics will come in slowly, over maybe 25 years.
4473 2018-12-05 17:38:39 But... I thought you said we were self sufficient? You know,  when you wanted to sell off the Gulf Coast oil reserves.
4474 2018-12-05 17:38:33 Peak oil can’t come soon enough
4475 2018-12-05 17:38:16 And if they don’t, call then cowards and imply they can’t change oil.
4476 2018-12-05 17:38:00 Empresa alemana busca adquirir Sierra Oil&Gas , la firma alemana DEA Deutsche Erdoel AG firmó un acuerdo para adquirir Sierra Oil&Gas. La operación está valuada en 500 millones de dólares. La transacción está sujeta a varias aprobaciones, entre estas las de CNH y COFECE.
4477 2018-12-05 17:37:48 Mind you sir, very soon crude oil will fall and it useful reduce if not go into extinction.  We need to think out of box
4478 2018-12-05 17:37:33 The world needs to use less oil you muppet.
4479 2018-12-05 17:37:30 @maguipradop avisale a la ingeniera q hace años nuestra matriz eléctrica es con energía renovable...apenas aveces se usaba la central Batlle a fuel oil, y cada vez que se hacía se nos caía un lagrimón!!

4488 2018-12-05 17:36:50 Code for.  I realize MBs was responsible but to protect mine and Jared’s interests I will use oil prices as the excuse for no action
4489 2018-12-05 17:36:48 I feel like the guys at oil change places show you a really dirty air filter just for you to get a new one, like does anyone else feel like they try to pull a magic trick on you?
4490 2018-12-05 17:36:47 We should develop strategies to not rely on Opec oil. It's why the hornets nest exists due to our reliance on their oil.
4491 2018-12-05 17:36:45 El de la  “oil to 19” no opina lo mismo...
4492 2018-12-05 17:36:44 buy crude oil at 52.50$ sl52.20 tgt again abv 54 $ if sl safe 2 night cmp 53.41$
4493 2018-12-05 17:36:40 Although, I've not heard him talk about the North Pole in relation to oil...yet.  I'vw heard his negotiations with Saudi, and of course the OPEC discussions upcoming...which as we know are two different remits.  I'll listen out for the 'north pole' stuff...it may take a while.
4494 2018-12-05 17:36:32 How bout when your money goes to things you disagree with, like killing babies in the Middle East, or oil subsidies?
4495 2018-12-05 17:36:29 To be fair though it's not like he's really ever been given the opportunity to support a truly bold climate change plan, the kind that is necessary. We don't know where his line is drawn. But some oil execs think they do, and they probably have better info that you or I.
4496 2018-12-05 17:36:19 The taxes from oil pay for health care and schools. While schools might not benefit you, health care will.
4497 2018-12-05 17:36:14 my scalp hurt the oil ain’t do nothing
4498 2018-12-05 17:36:14 They want no oil. Period. Now isn’t that an disingenuous, delusional, ideologically driven fairy tale. Notley & Trudeau should both have their luxury automobiles & first class airline tickets permanently confiscated. That might break the Marxist Godfather’s spell.
4499 2018-12-05 17:36:12 what kind of finish we working wit there Coach ... is that shellac or linseed oil? Maybe a clear coat?

4501 2018-12-05 17:36:08 I take 2-3 droppers FULL of oil.

4504 2018-12-05 17:36:00 Even if he did it you should just shut up and do nothing. MBS got the oil. If you want oil and money, just shut up.
4505 2018-12-05 17:35:58 The Bush 41 gets eulogized the more we see P Trump's accomplishments for the great gulf of separation his tenure shows from former presidents and himself.
The Bush couple were globalist, with little or no concern for Amrrican middle class. Witness China trade and Saudi oil prices
4506 2018-12-05 17:35:56 I remember when all you needed was Pink Oil Moisturizer to lay your hair down. Shid, I need half a gallon of eco gel and a jar of edge control now .
4507 2018-12-05 17:35:55 Mr. President.... Oil foreclosure for the dictatorship in Venezuela! Want to write a chapter in the history of the whole continent. Change the situation in Venezuela, regain freedom to Venezuelans.
4508 2018-12-05 17:35:44 Andy is desperate for Canada to fail. He wants the economy to tank. He wants trade deals to fall apart. He wants oil prices to drop. 

He wants this so he can point and say, “it’s their fault!”, regardless of how many it hurts. 

That’s why you’ll never win.
4509 2018-12-05 17:35:36 suspicious about electric cars, and "green efforts" after seen globalism embracing it so hard, and setting deadlines for fossil ban.

 Brazil has a Saudi Arabia of oil
@jairbolsonaro's team has just passed a rag on our oil business, and together we would dictate the price.
4510 2018-12-05 17:35:34 You are still thinking about whether he is real or not?  
Fake is written all over him.
His words, his steps, his looks, even his oil is fake.
What about the fake miracles? All fake.

4515 2018-12-05 17:35:05 Love coconut oil 
4516 2018-12-05 17:35:05 Maybe another one about the price of oil?
4517 2018-12-05 17:35:02 That's Impossible though. We have the oil.  It will be another case of WM spouting lies to make Scots feel important while really our country is the crutch supporting a broken state.
4518 2018-12-05 17:35:00 Then McTurtle pats him on the head while he strips voting rights, women’s rights, healthcare, stacks the judiciary with unqualified, racist puppets of big oil and business.

4520 2018-12-05 17:34:32 lol “oil poached”
4521 2018-12-05 17:34:18 um, we are an oil-rich nation. is easy to wipe out renewable energy infrastructure compared to our petroleum infrastructure & the fact that we have amassed quite a bit of oil in our strategic reserves. You cannot fight a war without petroleum products!
4522 2018-12-05 17:34:10 track the world's oil money and you have your answer  #CorruptB
4523 2018-12-05 17:34:00 You know there's only a limited amount of oil, right?  If you think it's expensive now, wait until we're just about out of oil.
At the current use, we have 53 years of oil left. As we use it, it will be harder and more expensive to extract.
4524 2018-12-05 17:33:53 I think it is a bad idea to couple the two. We need energy efficiency whether we extract oil or not.
4525 2018-12-05 17:33:51 Better yet we want to replace oil for a cheaper renewable alternative
4526 2018-12-05 17:33:48 I’d invest IN Barclays if they support the oil sands.
4527 2018-12-05 17:33:35 I always feel like the worker dudes judge me based on the stuff in my car when I get an oil change. #itsnotacannonball
4528 2018-12-05 17:33:35 Well that’s just UR interpretation. Eliminate the oil sands, u mean kinda like how Harper ACTUALLY committed us 2 eliminating our entire O&G industry by 2100? Or is this about the CT? Cuz ya know, CT was brought 2 govt BY the heads of the industry who met before NDP got elected?
4529 2018-12-05 17:33:32 Although it’s worth saying that Ferraro are on the good list as far as palm oil goes-they use the most sustainable kind apparently.
4530 2018-12-05 17:33:30 Cussons Baby Oil
4531 2018-12-05 17:33:25 FYI US imports <8% of oil from Saudi Arabia.  Why is it that MBS has more leverage on us then we have on him?  Is it because he promised you will actually be a billionaire by the time your are out of office?
4532 2018-12-05 17:33:23 The centrists have broken through super pac trap progressives set,time to set another one,many 2020 dem hopefuls have pledged off super pac,but are still beholden to large contributions from executives in oil,insurance,finance etc.this has to be called out.

4535 2018-12-05 17:33:19 @johndcoughlang1 @MickPuck It's a toss up between The Waterboys, The Icicle Works, Midnight Oil & The Cruxshadows.
4536 2018-12-05 17:33:15 True.....and I assume petrojam is the only refinery in Jamaica, right?
So if that's the case that would imply that the missing oil would have left the island, right?
4537 2018-12-05 17:33:01 Two key Canadian oil pipelines to the United States are now back in service. 
A number of lines in @Enbridge's Mainline system (1.2M bpd) and @TransCanada's Keystone pipeline (590K bpd) were down as a result of power outages across Saskatchewan.
4538 2018-12-05 17:32:59 When you cook something in oil for the first time, it comes out delicious if cooked properly. But if the cook keeps using the same oil over and over again for the same food, it becomes rancid and unenjoyable.

That's how I see Sonic Team at times.
4539 2018-12-05 17:32:53 if he wants the Saudi's to keep feeding him money he needs to buy their oil....it is all about the Trump Mafia and their bank accounts and how much they can fleece the taxpayers out of
4540 2018-12-05 17:32:52 Looks like light-refraction of soil there.. those blue bars at bottom.. well if it’s leak then it’s like rainbow colours on road created by oil from cars in water
4541 2018-12-05 17:32:47 Does the dinosaur symbolize the source of the oil? I love it.
4542 2018-12-05 17:32:39 Like Standard Oil?
4543 2018-12-05 17:32:37 Congratulations on hanging over a thousand years of political tension and 200 years of bad oil leases/corruption upon a recently departed man.
4544 2018-12-05 17:32:28 Let’s see,,, with experiencing France lately it’s best keeping oil on low price

4551 2018-12-05 17:32:06 If nothing else, Large ships should convert off Bunker oil to #2 Kerosene and ports should modify to use shore power to support these ships while they are loading. I suspect renewable ammonia is a good solution for ships in the future.

4553 2018-12-05 17:31:55 I see this point if all of the candidates are taking big donations from oil execs, but (especially for the 2020 race) there will most certainly be candidates that have taken none or very little. That should tell you something.

4561 2018-12-05 17:31:36 if oil is dinosaur fossils and plastic is made with oil. that means, plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs  
might be 100 percent wrong but idc it works in my head
4562 2018-12-05 17:31:33 Kind of bizarre that firms engaging in oil drilling don't fall under "oil and gas extraction" if their activities are done on a contract basis

4570 2018-12-05 17:31:06 US strategy vis-à-vis Gulf states like UAE is - US purchases oil frm them & with that money they will purchase arms frm US. India offers no such deal. It's a one way traffic.India will purchase oil at inflated rates in US$ & UAE uses that money to promote Islamist agenda in India

4574 2018-12-05 17:30:52 So do I you believe he intentionally had Pearl Harbor lower it’s defenses or something like that to make the outcome worse to gin up war support?
Or are you just talking about the oil embargo?

4580 2018-12-05 17:30:18 But, it’s crude oil that’s missing, not gas. How does that make sense? Lemmie read what you wrote again.
4581 2018-12-05 17:30:17 Hey,  Don,  actually alcohol is the king of addictive killers for homo sapiens.   For civilizations,  it's  crude oil.   But being the best at all the things,  you already knew that.   Ahem.
4582 2018-12-05 17:30:17 How about this? I don't pay for your oil blood money wars? How's about that?
4583 2018-12-05 17:30:17 It is restricted stupid they cut back production quite a bit,when global including US reserves at at an all time high either you reduce the price or OPEC reduces production.they get less than $40 a barrel but U sell fuel as if oil is $80-$100 a barrel problem is with U.S not OPEC
4584 2018-12-05 17:30:15 I’m still waiting for coal powered Chevrolet Corvette and that oil powered margarita machine. Probably never happen anyway since no one can afford steel and aluminum, they will have to be made out of all the access soybeans laying around

4588 2018-12-05 17:30:09 So are the oil executives that donated to him stupid then? Or maybe do they know something that we don't know?

Given the opportunity to vote for candidates that are opposed entirely by the oil industry, why would we choose Beto?

4594 2018-12-05 17:29:55 Attn [name redacted] p.r. specialist: Gonna pass on your pitch for a new line of coffee & tea rooms given that I'm, you know, an oil reporter.
4595 2018-12-05 17:29:53 I thought you said that you liked to apply the motion smoothing setup before watching videos on the Internet? Why else was the baby oil next to your computer in the background? I'm confused now.
4596 2018-12-05 17:29:53 Thinking about making some edibles.. I've been infusing coconut oil lately
4597 2018-12-05 17:29:52 So tell me, whats the positive about rise in oil price
4598 2018-12-05 17:29:44 We don't understand. Should we retweet?
4599 2018-12-05 17:29:40 You is a tweeny weeny ickle liar. No one wanted a referendum on the EU. Except a few hundred rich tax-dodgers who were 'represented' fully in HoC, media & everywhere else thanks to the greasy oil of £££...
4600 2018-12-05 17:29:39 Oil was at $14 Barrel that haven’t been seen since the 80’s. Gas should be at about .38 a litre so quit blowing smoke up King Fords butt.
4601 2018-12-05 17:29:37 He needs the oil because it is one of the ingredients to make face & hand cream to keep him white & orange?
4602 2018-12-05 17:29:33 Before Iran , Kuwait used to export oil to Israel , it’s all about money and benefits .
4603 2018-12-05 17:29:31 Oil prices today are about the same as when I got my license in 2003, but the price/gallon at the pump is over $0.75-$1.00 more than then. I'm in CA, so $0.12 of that is added state tax (feds haven't increased since '93), but still..
4604 2018-12-05 17:29:25 Should Mr. Sheeran have likewise put oil on his bosom also?
4605 2018-12-05 17:29:22 So I’m getting my oil changed waiting and there’s a woman and a child who comes in. The child looks about 5 and he got a pacifier in his mouth, what in the entire fuck.
4606 2018-12-05 17:29:21 Renewable energy is getting more reliable and efficient year on year. What ever you may think of it, it is the future. I'm not at all supprised at the slump in oil prices why would any new investors put their money into such archiac sources

4610 2018-12-05 17:29:07 Hi there! Thanks for your inquiry about Palm Oil. Would you mind sending us a DM so we can tell you more information about our use?
4611 2018-12-05 17:29:04 I don’t have a picture but for Christmas my sister in law got me real cheap socks (cause it was a last minute gift) that at the bottom says “shhh I’m gaming” and she said “because you play video games amirite?!” They are now used to change the oil.
4612 2018-12-05 17:29:04 India with come out of this phase. Oil colonialism is passe. It's the rule of the Sunshine Alliance now.
4613 2018-12-05 17:29:01 The right must use #billionaires like Soros, & even #Bloomberg to hype their side since there are no real #renewable energy tycoons. Plus #Soros has taken up every #liberal cause, according to #conservatives, so he is now broke. And T. Boone Pickens is mostly an #oil billionaire.
4614 2018-12-05 17:28:47 The list someone published about how Beto O’Rourke for instance received a bunch of money from the oil and gas industry. Except that it turns out the money is from employees of the largest industry in the state. A rather important distinction I dare add.
4615 2018-12-05 17:28:44 Devin Moran to drive for Dunn Benson Motorsports in 2019 & will follow the  Lucas Oil Late Model Tour. Read the full article on D.o.D.
4616 2018-12-05 17:28:42 That is a different case - He was asked to collect Oil coupons from Saddam...poor guy got some millions for himself too.
4617 2018-12-05 17:28:35 Obama laid off thousands in the OIL&Energy in Wyoming and tried to shut down MEAT & OIL industries in Texas, Gov Abbott didn’t let him mess with Texas..
Trump is creating thousands of jobs, small business are booming and hiring after tax cuts..
4618 2018-12-05 17:28:34 The Eccles crash was 45147 on a Liverpool to Scarborough which did a SPAD, right into the back of the oil train. It hit it so hard, 1 tanker actually flew into the air. Very nasty crash.
4619 2018-12-05 17:28:16 Guys what is missing is 600000 barrels of CRUDE oil. Not processed product.
4620 2018-12-05 17:28:16 it's me. i'm Pure Steel. crude oil runs through my fuckign veins
4621 2018-12-05 17:28:15 so just your straight-up WASP dynast with opportunistic ties to the oil industry?
4622 2018-12-05 17:28:12 I’ve shopped with you today, love the no palm oil products. I have to say I refuse to buy chicken from Thailand & Brazil. Reasons-carbon footprint, food quality, animal welfare and hygiene standards. Please can you use more British chicken (& other meats) in the future!
4623 2018-12-05 17:28:10 Coconut oil 400₹ per killo
4624 2018-12-05 17:28:03 Not so mush as in spray n the popped corn, but adding a few drops to the oil & other flavoring while popping the corn. Ya don't really taste it. I worked the local bullrides in concessions. The local drive-in theatre owner sez it's a way to sell more soda. 
4625 2018-12-05 17:28:02 Zero sympathy. The snake oil they brought wasn’t the miracle tonic he said it would be
4626 2018-12-05 17:27:57 Listening to someone speaking about Hanukkah made me think of the verse of Holy Quran called 'Nur' ch. 18 v.36(35).  The light of God needs no oil.
4627 2018-12-05 17:27:57 Still, I'd feel a lot better about his oil policy if he was just across-the-board opposed by the entire industry. Hopefully we'll have the opportunity to vote for candidates that are, and these donations will come back into the spotlight at the right time. .

4631 2018-12-05 17:27:53 Look up his oil & gas contributions on open secrets & research his votes on oil drilling & fracking.
4632 2018-12-05 17:27:49 "Zinke and his political staff have consistently sidelined scientists and experts while handing the agency’s keys over to oil, gas and mining interests. The only saving grace is that Zinke and his colleagues are not very good at it, in many cases the courts are stopping them."
4633 2018-12-05 17:27:48 President Ramaphosa decreased petrol price? What  nonsense! It is crude oil price that decreased from $70 per barrel to $53 per barrel and stronger rand due to international factors. Stop telling lies! Swaziland buy petrol from SA but we buy a little at R13.30 from there.
4634 2018-12-05 17:27:40 I really would love to try 100mg syrup, 125mg vape tank, 300mg oil, 75mg 16.5 e-liquid and 5ct gummies
4635 2018-12-05 17:27:39 Saudi thanks President Trump by keeping oil price low. Look at the list of suicided peopl by Hillary. The USA is not doing any better than Saudi.
4636 2018-12-05 17:27:36 I wouldnt blame Ireland if it did but it would be a massive retrograde step. I dont classify myself as nationalist or unionist. Im a rare breed perhaps, actually a hibernophile and an anglophile. Go figure. But brexit is just a steaming pile of dung peddled by snake oil salesmen.

4650 2018-12-05 17:26:43 @RyanZinke, in the future your grandchildren will know how much you fucked over this great land for the benefit of your oil, gas, and coal buddies. Stop choking the science, use it to your advantage and help take care of the only land we have. Try making informed decisions.
4651 2018-12-05 17:26:35 Natwar Singh was not a little monkey in the Volcker food for oil scam. Even veteran family chaprasis can be booted out.
4652 2018-12-05 17:26:25 Their total oil loss was 1.5 million for the $18 billion. Of that they cant account for 600K
4653 2018-12-05 17:26:20 If we said that the gender identity rights of oil was being infringed he would make the discussion a priority.
4654 2018-12-05 17:26:17 Its a blessing in disguise, now America can see the people it calls friends because they have oil and money, time to question all of the relationships.

4656 2018-12-05 17:26:12 Texas represents over half the oil and gas workers in the state. It only takes about 36 donors down before the average donation drops to 100 bucks.

4658 2018-12-05 17:26:04 We get very little of our oil from them. Do not justify propping up a murderer. We are not interested.
4659 2018-12-05 17:26:02 If they jack it up too much then it is time to increase our production so it backfires. Now that we are once again outproducing them and can fill our reserves to the hilt, time to deny cash to Russia and Middle East. Also the option of rescinding buy wavers for Iranian oil.
4660 2018-12-05 17:26:01 Putin and bannon will be so disappointed not to get the brexit they paid for.

4668 2018-12-05 17:25:13 All that he have spoken about outside the country is the truth. some youth who are not ready to work in Niger delta but want the fed govt to give them money freely. Of cos I unstand why they can't work bcos the past govt overlook d probs  of oil spillage

4670 2018-12-05 17:25:00 The world will eventually see oil restricted soon after you leave the white house.  Didn't you resently say " a government shutdown would do us good?"
4671 2018-12-05 17:24:57 The world does not need oil*
4672 2018-12-05 17:24:52 Of course there is money in oil. And it is a world wide commodity with its own cartel. But oil is a proven resource that is the base of an economy that has lifted literally Billions out of poverty. Windmills net positive is minimal and they kill a whole lot of birds too.
4673 2018-12-05 17:24:45 Thanks,  I know,  I am going to update my Oil thoughts in a public report shortly.  I'll tweet out a link when ready.  Thx again  :)
4674 2018-12-05 17:24:33 Steve, could you update pivots for oil pls?
4675 2018-12-05 17:24:33 Sure, that's what is on your mind. Oil prices, not thinking about prison or Mueller at all.
4676 2018-12-05 17:24:25 You don’t control OPEC. If you don’t want to pay higher prices for oil perhaps you should start using our reserves.
4677 2018-12-05 17:24:24 Oil was the family business!
4678 2018-12-05 17:24:20 I need an oil change but I really dont feel like sitting around waiting on it
4679 2018-12-05 17:24:13 Lol. Maybe if you let them murder some more reporters threll keep oil prices down for you?
4680 2018-12-05 17:24:11 are you serious not the only source of oil for a life or your own pocket $$$ you are obvious with your lies and cover ups i'm done with you and the many evil lil dirty tricks you have up your sleeves by a concern middle class citizen thats paying the rich taxes now!!!!!

4682 2018-12-05 17:23:45 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
4683 2018-12-05 17:23:45 Counter point: Send oil company ceos to The Hague for crimes against humanity now.
4684 2018-12-05 17:23:41 I shidded oil into my pants
4685 2018-12-05 17:23:36 The United States will do nothing about Saudi Arabia's behaviour because as an enemi they will sell their oil for a different currency not the american dollar and that would increase the weakening of the american control of the world economy
4686 2018-12-05 17:23:20 Surprise holiday activities so far: sleeping in with bae, car maintenance (oil change, tire rotation, winter windshield fluid), late breakfast, tbd

It’s mad nice having the day off
4687 2018-12-05 17:23:20 And Bernie’s surrogate, David Sirota, had the audacity to attack Beto for campaign donations from oil/gas employees. 
4688 2018-12-05 17:23:14 Bearing in mind he is already violating the INF treaty and creating new weapons outside of it. If there's an arms race then oil at $50 a barrel means only one winner. Not Russia.
4689 2018-12-05 17:23:13 Come on is long these oil at sell to garrison area and sell to friend only thing why I am sad Andrew Wheatley should clean house before he start
4690 2018-12-05 17:23:06 What was the price Oil then compared to dollar rate and now buhari is making more money now with recession and double digit to show for it
4691 2018-12-05 17:23:04 Exactly, but the @DNC and @NancyPelosi have shown no signs of providing that leadership.

It’s 2019 and the Dems are just talking about a “committee to study climate change”.

Where in the f**k have they been the past 10 years??

Besides taking cash from Big Oil and Big Energy.
4692 2018-12-05 17:22:56 Since 1934, the $ is just a piece of paper backed by nothing (besides perhaps Saudi oil + military might), Muamar could have done well with his gold denar if they hadn't shortened his life

SCRAMBLED EGG
turn on the kitchen and put some oil in, wait 'til it's hot, and then cracc the egg and throw it on the pan, and when the egg is hot flip it, do it again and that's it!
4695 2018-12-05 17:22:46 I have to go get my brakes checked and my oil changed today, but I dont wanna get outta bed. It's nice and toasty snuggling in here with Bowser and Blooper.
4696 2018-12-05 17:22:42 I get coconut oil in my eyes every morning 
4697 2018-12-05 17:22:40 Federal District Court Judge found that the scumObama Dept was in contempt of his ruling that the offshore oil drilling moratorium, imposed by the admin in 2010, was unconstitutional.  Feldman struck down the drilling ban, the Interior Department simply established a second ban.
4698 2018-12-05 17:22:35 We need innovation!! Stop our dependence on oil. Oh Sorry! I forgot u don’t believe in science.. 
4699 2018-12-05 17:22:24 You have a serious obsession with Tendai thank God you’re clueless about what you say.I read your article and any normal person would have said the same,stop attention seeking using @BitiTendai as your critic  tengesai cooking oil quietly which I’m told you’re struggling to do 
4700 2018-12-05 17:22:23 You win a point, for knowing the answer.  No points to Angel, for not being able to distinguish between country/northern-most global axis/ and an umbrella group of oil exporters.
4701 2018-12-05 17:22:15 Ouiii 
4702 2018-12-05 17:22:11 Right lmfao
Empty that oil pan out. Bye bye motor lmao
4703 2018-12-05 17:22:05 Share it among the less privileged. I have some widows around and will like to share a bag of rice amongst them and a keg of vegetable or Palm oil. Just a way of giving back during Christ's birth and winning more souls into the kingdom
4704 2018-12-05 17:22:00 Rising oil prices is sign of a strong economy. Falling like it is ,is the first sign of recession.
4705 2018-12-05 17:21:53 Maybe if Alberta would have waited a week for its bold unilateral decision to restrict its oil production OPEC+ would have agreed to a larger cut in output themselves.  Size not known yet, but looks to be around the bare minimum of 1 mln bpd, and that includes Russia.

4719 2018-12-05 17:21:14 In Italy, certain pizzerias will serve a dish called farinata. It's made from chickpea flour, olive oil, water, salt, maybe some herbs. They can serve it plain, with thinly shaved veggies (ie. asparagus, cipollini, artichokes, mushroom), cheese or sausage for those so inclined.
4720 2018-12-05 17:21:13 I’ve rubbed coconut oil in my hair

4721 2018-12-05 17:21:03 Our oil and gas prices are down so I guess it's time to sock it to us again

4725 2018-12-05 17:20:55 A day of grievance where oil prices and other should not be discussed out of respect.
4726 2018-12-05 17:20:51 I swear she did. It was awhile ago i seen it on her ig one time. And idk castor or rosehip oil?? 
4727 2018-12-05 17:20:48 But I deep fry my French fries in coconut oil...
4728 2018-12-05 17:20:32 You know how you control oil prices? By being less dependent on it.
4729 2018-12-05 17:20:30 That is a LOT Of oil.  Is it blessed?  Is it for salad?  WHO KNOWS?
4730 2018-12-05 17:20:28 He only loves rallies where he's the object of the croud's affection. This isn't about Trump. It's somber and boring. He can't sit still. He'd much rather be riling up the croud and pontificating his snake oil nonsense. He also knows this croud wouldn't buy what he's selling.
4731 2018-12-05 17:20:28 At least it wasn't the ability to control oil...
4732 2018-12-05 17:20:27 I believe that's supposed to be bigger Fennel to saute in heart healthy olive oil.  
4733 2018-12-05 17:20:23 That was his OIL focus so good for him
4734 2018-12-05 17:20:07 @HurdOnTheHill sir, several months ago you visited the site of a new oil refinery being built by MMEX. 

Do you have an update on this project? Do you know if the project is still on track?
4735 2018-12-05 17:20:02 Here's a racist white aesthetic and Indonesia were peak oil tends to live in the launch webinar
4736 2018-12-05 17:19:50 It wont have ahuge effect. Because something like 43% of the US oil comes from Canada.
4737 2018-12-05 17:19:49 Hopefully? Aren’t you supposed to be “art of the deal” guy? Didn’t you negotiate lower oil prices when you let them get away with the murder and dismemberment of a Washington Post reporter? Geeeesh....
4738 2018-12-05 17:19:40 The survey findings in that article are plain BS. Vendors continue to sell portability. Some senior folks in companies continue to buy portability. It's all a game of snake oil exchange.
4739 2018-12-05 17:19:38 How much will it cost  the homeowner for power provided without using oil and natural gas?
4740 2018-12-05 17:19:37 2 months ago you wanted credit for low oil prices.
Now if prices go up you will blame OPEC.
Handy how it is never your fault if things go bad.
4741 2018-12-05 17:19:35 I'm sure Texas shale oil producers will jump at the chance to undercut thus decision.
4742 2018-12-05 17:19:30 Thread on #Peakoil and #transitionmovement
There's no incentive to make it work. If I go to the local village that we have to build 'local resilience' to weather the peak oil storm, I'll get laughed at as they drive by in their cars off to some supermarket.
4743 2018-12-05 17:19:30 I'm actually just kind of trolling. But props to @amazingatheist for being accessible and rolling with the joke. The rest of them just cash their oil money checks and stay silent.
4744 2018-12-05 17:19:18 What happened to you making us “no longer dependent on foreign oil?” Another promise broken!
4745 2018-12-05 17:19:17 We could beat this altogether if we invested in alternate energy sources...and help the environment at the same time.

After a while they could drink their glut of oil instead of withholding it to drive the consumer prices higher.

Just a thought.
4746 2018-12-05 17:19:10 Mr President no one wants higher oil prices or any increase in anything except our salaries. We as a country are tired of having to pay for other people's mistakes
4747 2018-12-05 17:19:10 Why is it they want us to pay?

What about China and the oil burners In the middle east...
4748 2018-12-05 17:19:05 I remember one time I asked @Sebastian1botek if he could change my oil bc he “loves cars and loves working on them” and he said no. There’s no love here.
4749 2018-12-05 17:19:04 I'll stop checking Amazon for bear oil now.

4755 2018-12-05 17:18:44 I once read a fic where they used coconut oil and even got a spoon to scoop it out

And made a huge deal of how they could easily get the lube from the bedroom but were too horny

I just kept imagining them drizzling oil from a spoon the whole sex scene

4763 2018-12-05 17:18:05 Screw oil prices, all due respect. We don't want a president with blood on his hands using fake US priorities as an excuse for his backdoor private deals.
4764 2018-12-05 17:17:58 Family wealth that came from oil where all men are pigs I guess !
4765 2018-12-05 17:17:56 Depending on the person, healthy fats such as olive oil and ghee can be used in cooking. 1 tsp + spices to start cooking lentils or a kitchari dish is a good general amount.
4766 2018-12-05 17:17:56 U re not getting me..during their period with the price of oil we should be talking of 0.01 inflation rate..and u re still raising shoulders here..colossal failure that’s what they were no wonder we booted them out..2019 will b worse for them u just watch..

4772 2018-12-05 17:17:33 Yup. I'm in Houston, worked 18 years in oil/chem. I gave Beto what I could and phone banked for him. Not because of any relationship with Big Oil, but because HE WAS AN AWESOME CANDIDATE
4773 2018-12-05 17:17:30 I have 2 college-aged kids and  have written 13 published books. Yet the thing that makes me feel most "adult" is taking my car for an oil change & tire rotation before it reaches a crucial point! #AdultingAndStuff

4776 2018-12-05 17:17:18 Not completely true.  Once it is extracted and the royalties paid it is their oil.  This is why it is important to not forget to collect billions in royalties like the last Conservative government did.

4778 2018-12-05 17:17:06 So you ignore a Washington Post journalist’s assassination to keep oil prices low?! SAD
4779 2018-12-05 17:17:02 Oddly enough the increase in oil production and price drop since 2014 is Iraq production from most of the charts and data I have seen.   (Maybe Bush was right long term but missed it by 14 years.)
4780 2018-12-05 17:16:45 Very problematic, which is why I brought it up. OTOH there's an argument to be made for reducing our dependence on foreign oil bc that has drawn us deeply into a number of intractable conflicts in the Middle East. When I say it's complicated, I'm not being glib.
4781 2018-12-05 17:16:32 Listening to Cliff Hughes on @Nationwideradio speaking about  what needs to happen at Petrojam coming out of the AuGD report. "The entity needs to be gutted" he says....I agree 100%.....how are you not able to account for 600,000 barrels of oil over a 5 year period ??

They create war to make money and monopolize on money and oil. Not that great
4791 2018-12-05 17:15:47 I think that is oil
4792 2018-12-05 17:15:46 Good god y’all sure are rewriting history with this shit. From what I remember he started a war over oil, pardoned a bunch of shitheads, and had a history of soft segregation. What am I missing? Did he cure aids? Oh wait no he actually helped aids grow
4793 2018-12-05 17:15:43 Prevention would have been better than the cure. Cutting interest rates in 2015 was World Class stupid on the part of Poloz.  It wasn't going to bring back any Alberta oil jobs due to the oil crash at the time, but it did inflate our housing bubbles.
4794 2018-12-05 17:15:41 7. Japan to invest $30 billion in DMIC.

4804 2018-12-05 17:14:55 I can't wait for the politicians to line up to the microphone to praise Big Oil for dropping prices so low there is no profit.
4805 2018-12-05 17:14:55 We have a 2012 and a 2015 Chevy Volts, we've owned since new. These are the best cars we've ever owned. 90+% of our miles have been on the batteries. Except for tires and oil changes, our maintenance, repair costs have been 0.
4806 2018-12-05 17:14:53 We need the next president to have an oil policy that is significantly more progressive than Obama though. Obama's position on fracking was/is a serious problem.
4807 2018-12-05 17:14:53 Hey Einstein we r #1 in oil exports so let us buy cheaper oil by selling it here
4808 2018-12-05 17:14:52 Or maybe we dont buy their oil? Maybe we simply dont use oil period? Maybe we find another way to power our world before we end up in the ground like the black gold we use so recklessly.

4834 2018-12-05 17:12:42 Let the Saudis drink their oil, we really don't need it.
4835 2018-12-05 17:12:38 Happy birthday to you
A man from Olive Oil country in Provence!...
4836 2018-12-05 17:12:37 The world does not need high oil prices, and people expect oil prices to be lower.
4837 2018-12-05 17:12:33 Which oil are they using? Pepper-disappoint-mint? Tea-treason? Laven-derringer pistol whip to the back of the head?
4838 2018-12-05 17:12:29 oil me up
4839 2018-12-05 17:12:22 you need to put oil after showers before you dry off and when you dry off pat don’t rub then you need to get lotion that is Vaseline/petroleum based that is on the thicker side and use that wear pajamas that are long sleeves and pants to keep the moisture in
4840 2018-12-05 17:12:10 Very big on Urbal Activ mints at the moment, how do you feel about the oil? Do you just take a few drops or do you mix it with a drink?
4841 2018-12-05 17:12:04 the earth makes OIL it is a renewable energy source
4842 2018-12-05 17:12:03 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
4843 2018-12-05 17:12:03 That's your interpretation. To me they are a far left party and their end goal is the elimination of the oil sands. They are putting on a show right now because of the election. They are zealots, trhough and through.
4844 2018-12-05 17:12:01 Funny how at Thanksgiving you praised yourself for the oil prices being lower, really up $20 a barrel since you've taken office, now you don't want OPEC to go higher. Interesting.
4845 2018-12-05 17:11:55 Aloes & Sunbirds!  Oil on canvas 140cm x 90cm 

Always a great joy to paint, and inspired by the aloe gardens in the Lowveld yearly over winter.  These two are off to their new home in London shortly.

4848 2018-12-05 17:11:45 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

4851 2018-12-05 17:11:28 UPDATE: MSNBC's Katy Tur just spotted drinking melted glacier water in a gas-guzzling muscle car w/"Party Like it's 1999" blasting from her radio ... motoring to cut down trees and have a lantern-lit (oil) barbecue (w/coal).
4852 2018-12-05 17:11:27 This tweet shows the truth:  HOPE is all you have to influence oil prices.  
4853 2018-12-05 17:11:26 I’ve searched both ‘Costa coffee’ and ‘whitbread’ under ‘list of members’ on this link, but there are no results for either. Can you once again confirm (and evidence) that Costa uses palm oil from sustainable sources?
4854 2018-12-05 17:11:26 OPEC and Russia moved closer on Wednesday to agreeing cuts in oil  production from next year despite pressure from U.S. President Donald  Trump to reduce the price of crude.
4855 2018-12-05 17:11:24 Well, if we relied less on oil and more on SUSTAINABLE ENERGY LIKE WIND AND SOLAR then oil prices would NOT be a concern! I know, this is just way too progressive for your pea brain to understand!The 21st century started 19 years ago, care to join?
4856 2018-12-05 17:11:24 You going to bring back some oil?

- I stopped using make up remover, it dried out my skin, and I started using coconut oil. It didn’t make my skin dry, but it took off all my makeup
4860 2018-12-05 17:11:17 Have we found the missing chairs @ MBCC ,the sand and now barrels of oil?

So much more missing in this country. 

#Petrojam #MissingOil #MissingSand #MissingChairs
4861 2018-12-05 17:11:16 I did that as well.  Oops.  I just refill with sewing machine oil.  It’s really great that you’ve got them to sell.  It’s hard to get them in small quantities here.
4862 2018-12-05 17:11:13 The first and last comments are a contradiction! So, which is it Mr Oman Oil Minister?
4863 2018-12-05 17:11:12 I now use oil on my body instead of actual Lotion. The best decision ever. I thought my body would be oily, but nah.
4864 2018-12-05 17:11:06 that's why Obama pushed to make the United States OF AMERICA the BIGGEST producer of oil - so we'll never be blackmailed again by your SAUDI overlords!
4865 2018-12-05 17:11:05 And stealing barrels of oil under quiet with 5.2b. I can’t with all this news. 

Not to mention the 1000USD on one cake. Wild’n indeed sis
4866 2018-12-05 17:11:03 People forget that Mulroney was a steward for the environment prior to the new conservatives who are just oil shills if you don't know what acid rain is, thank Brian Mulroney.
4867 2018-12-05 17:10:55 Backpedaling runs rampant in this administration 
“We had to grant oil waivers to ensure that we did not increase the price of oil,” Hook told reporters on Monday
4868 2018-12-05 17:10:51 Says you! OPEC are actually thinking of the US, If the price of oil is low America cant produce!!!! Dont you know ITS NOT COST EFFECTIVE FOR 'Merica, OMG! You really dont understand do you
4869 2018-12-05 17:10:50 Learning so much this morning at The GHP Houston Region Economic Outlook panel “How do we repurpose our workforce to do more with less?” In response to 90K lost O&G jobs Cindy Taylor CEO of Oil States Industries @OilStatesInd @GHPartnership @FlatironSchool #HOUEconDev
4870 2018-12-05 17:10:42 We all know after the next lock out in 2020 there will be a compliance buy out like last time and the Oil will cut him then
4871 2018-12-05 17:10:33 Ha!  She was going on the oil tanks. That grave was too hasty.
4872 2018-12-05 17:10:31 We do get a significant amount of oil from Canada but I know Trump will not thank them.  Prime minister Trudeau is much smarter than Trump and Trump does not like that at all.
4873 2018-12-05 17:10:24 But We also don’t want to see our national parksreduced in size & exploited to oil companies!
4874 2018-12-05 17:10:24 I see some problems with this.  Average car on the road is 12 years old, people don't have the disposable income to switch.  Is there enough Lithium for this total replacement?  How do you replace all the jobs in the Oil industry? Do you have the Grid robustness for all electric?
4875 2018-12-05 17:10:17 If only there was a way America could reduce it's dependency on oil...

... any sensible President would be looking at becoming energy secure
4876 2018-12-05 17:10:13 Right after I have my guinea pig, chicken, horse, and bull with bacon sandwich...all of it fried in whale oil...really, whoever came up with this needs help...

4878 2018-12-05 17:10:08 And some people believe the Earth is flat. The overwhelming majority of scientists disagree with them. Personally I trust the testimony and evidence of tens of thousands of highly qualified scientists over the preferred beliefs of oil lobbyists & a minority of the public.
4879 2018-12-05 17:10:05 It doesn't matter ... USDCAD big drop, so market shouldn't even care about those OPEC BS cuts ... It seems market just start to look on slow-down/recession process rather than inflationary spike which was closed when oil was at 76$ and that destroyed the global economy.
4880 2018-12-05 17:10:03 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
4881 2018-12-05 17:10:02 I don't think we will be on oil much longer. Maybe a slow wind down over 10 years. There is a lot of other stuff locked up in the patten office.
4882 2018-12-05 17:10:02 Potato soup, fixed it with olive oil salt and lemon :-)
4883 2018-12-05 17:10:00 Lowkey, owning a standard clinic is more profitable than oil.

4885 2018-12-05 17:09:55 This oil field thing is a trip. I'm on the phone majority of the time getting everything done and setting up shit for future situations more than I do labor work. And I kinda like it if I'm being honest haha.
4886 2018-12-05 17:09:50  you’re all so naive. Data is the new oil!!
4887 2018-12-05 17:09:48 LRTs: Good thread by my friend @CaptainJenno along with some key highlights. Be wary of these "sugar daddy" accounts, they are the modern day snake oil charlatans of social media. Their "benevolence" comes with a price too high and too dangerous to pay for momentarily happiness.

or both?

Like eat what you want, but don't tell me I have to eat nuts for the rest of my life. Plus they all bum off palm oil anyway the hypocrites.
4894 2018-12-05 17:09:20 Please, Americans don’t want higher oil prices and more taxes, but the democrats want turmoil higher oil prices would generate.
4895 2018-12-05 17:09:19 Essential oil is worth more than $80, especially in stressful times.
4896 2018-12-05 17:09:13 Why lay this at China's feet? Big Pharma, Big Oil/military industrial complex, the Bush/Clinton crime families and the war on drugs (supported at ALL levels) are clearly to blame.
4897 2018-12-05 17:09:11 I thought you said we didn’t need their oil???
4898 2018-12-05 17:09:10 3. Israel agrees on $5 million deal for Joint Education Research.

4903 2018-12-05 17:08:33 That's what happened to me in the 80's. Worked in Texas offshore oil till the priced dropped so low it wasn't worth it to explore. They capped a lot of those wells and laid us all off.
4904 2018-12-05 17:08:29 After a half-hour one may derive personal benefit from the oil. If the candles were extinguished before a half-hour, one may not derive benefit from the oil, unless he had specifically stipulated before lighting the candles that he wishes to use the oil.
4905 2018-12-05 17:08:16 The oil companies would just tack the rest on between refining, transportation to the pump, and profit. Then, when prices surge again, they'll never reduce those newly added costs.
4906 2018-12-05 17:08:13 And how it affects the price at the pumps. It never ever mek sense to mi say world oil prices a go down and Ja pump price a go up
4907 2018-12-05 17:08:09 We don’t. They need us more. Somebody has to keep buying their oil, without it they have nothing.
And US has enough oil now. Thanks Obama.
4908 2018-12-05 17:08:06 That's the definition of glut. BoC is not responsible for solving issues of over investment in oil patch but for controlling inflation.
4909 2018-12-05 17:08:04 America is using the death of kashoggi as a leverage to force Saudi Arabia out of opec so as to crash oil price? Let's think of it: Russia killed kashoggi on Turkish soil. Hypocritical trump would have riddled Russia with sanctions. Blood politics you played there.

4915 2018-12-05 17:07:47 scaremongering claims to further political and economic objectives of the UN on behalf of the Club of Rome.  Big Oil (and Coal) do not seem to be participating in the debate.  The AGW alarmists demonise CO2 because it is the key to collapsing western economies. /2

4937 2018-12-05 17:06:18 Why do people thing they owe undying loyalty to people they vote for?  It’s the other way around, folks.

Beto taking $$ from oil companies doesn’t make him an evil person.  But it does give perspective.  Don’t you want to know the truth?

4970 2018-12-05 17:03:59 oil prices are low but the cost of milk is crazy high.  i guess the government forcing a 75 cent tax on meat also includes mild.
4971 2018-12-05 17:03:56 Kyle I worry that you're taking terrible advice from snake oil salesmen who really do not have your interests or Canada's future in mind. These people see you as a disposable ballot to advance their personal political careers, nothing more. They're lying to you and all of Canada.
4972 2018-12-05 17:03:55 Bless. My two eldest cats have arthritis and thyroid issues - 2% CBD oil has been a life saver. It helps my youngest with his epilepsy too. Maybe look into that? Glad yours is doing a little better! OXOX

4974 2018-12-05 17:03:55 I was planning to get an oil change today but it's snowy as hell outside and it's my day off so I'm not going anywhere if I don't have to.

4977 2018-12-05 17:03:33 Putting a drop of lavender oil in my moisturizer is doing WONDERS!
4978 2018-12-05 17:03:33 @realDonaldTrump Want reverse his currency is pegged to OIL price
4979 2018-12-05 17:03:27 That would be way too progressive for America and all the politicians bought by oil lobbyists.
4980 2018-12-05 17:03:24 You have no effect on oil prices but you are willing to to take the credit when the prices are low.  Prices normally fluctuate, sometimes by a lot.  If war is threatened somewhere or during hurricane season the prices will rise.
4981 2018-12-05 17:03:06 They need more oil.
4982 2018-12-05 17:03:05 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
4983 2018-12-05 17:02:57 Nega we aren’t the same our oil changes don’t compare 
4984 2018-12-05 17:02:51 Just my thoughts in general, but not sure if it applies to oil and gas: There should be clauses in existing contracts that if contractors are not delivering deliverables, contracts will be canceled. If true, then the contracts can be re-awarded to others and no need to suspend.
4985 2018-12-05 17:02:48 Thought to ponder: Trump owns part of Qatar Inv Auth which is part of the Russian  #Rosneft oil deal. SCO mostlikely has all the details on that. That deal was finalized shortly after inauguration.
4986 2018-12-05 17:02:45 Notley and Alberta oil logic: extracting more oil reduces Canada's carbon emissions. Like when I eat all the donuts so I have the energy to…start losing weight. @cbcthecurrent
4987 2018-12-05 17:02:43 no va por ahora el oil brent, pareciera comenzar a ejecutar un hch bajista compresion 1hr y 30 min se aprecia. Mientras abuden el oil y sigan matando a los consumidores con precios, esto es para abajo
4988 2018-12-05 17:02:42 Oman oil minister says even Russia agrees there needs to be output reduction (apparently that’s what a cut is called now) #opec #oott
4989 2018-12-05 17:02:40 Acne is generally caused by the clogging of follicles and pores due to an overproduction of sebum (skin oil) or bacteria (although both are often present). #acne #acnetreatment #Tulsa

4993 2018-12-05 17:02:21 Upon 2nd thought, I am partially mistaken. Author at least does have her name on it. @lindsaymoyer 

And I could be more charitable. . . I suppose if the number of fries matters, especially the closer to 0 it gets. I just don't like the vibe that the type of oil doesn't matter
4994 2018-12-05 17:02:09 Your paper spent years slamming GHWB as a war profiteer and a man who sent US troops to their deaths for oil $$$.
4995 2018-12-05 17:02:06 She's just one in a long, long tradition of snake oil salesmen peddling miracle elixirs. She's literally the opposite of a "trailblazer."
4996 2018-12-05 17:02:01 If you suffer from toenail fungus. People like you have had success with Vicks Vapor Rub and Tea tree oil. However, if you suffer from chronic toenail fungus, see a doctor.

4998 2018-12-05 17:01:55 I forget the exchange rate.   How many millions of barrels of oil equal one dismembered journalist?
4999 2018-12-05 17:01:36 Way out in Hendo.. really brazy I gotta go to the dealership that I got my car at for an oil change when there’s one right n the north lol
5000 2018-12-05 17:01:35 They get away with it because far too many journalists let them either through ignorance or bias.  Adam Boulton being an exception. Lies aren’t opinion and should be called out and repeated back to the snake oil sellers.
5001 2018-12-05 17:01:32 Or literally use the oil that we're already sitting on?
5002 2018-12-05 17:01:30 Oil boom? Post the price of the oil boom period and the price of dollar then let  compare it with price of oil now with price of dollar buhari is making more money from Oil .buhari took nigeria from single digit inflation to double digit.
5003 2018-12-05 17:01:27 “Praise the Lord and send your money to me” snake oil salesman.
5004 2018-12-05 17:01:18 If they don't are you going to threaten sanctions on Iran again to get the Saudis and other oil producers to increase production? I wouldn't advise doing that again.
5005 2018-12-05 17:01:01 I can attest that Medical Marijuana CBD oil helps with nerve pain(neuropathy) and problems sleeping.
5006 2018-12-05 17:01:00 Ladies and gentlemen, if your significant other…

-doesn’t own a phone
-spends all day producing oil and gas for America
-always looks good
-helps improve the economy

They are not your significant other. They’re a pumpjack.
5007 2018-12-05 17:00:57 You should come and see GH tweeps ... you’ll think the  is crude oil ....
5008 2018-12-05 17:00:54 Agree. and the Oil merchants would've given JM anything he needed to win the league / compete in Europe, they wouldn't have vetoed signing based on their perception of a players ability, the cost or cause the manager had already signed players for that position.
5009 2018-12-05 17:00:46 We need renewable energy solutions, not more oil.
5010 2018-12-05 17:00:38 Allah Ya jikanta da Rahma...
5011 2018-12-05 17:00:36 I was given a couple of these spinning oil pens at a Handspinning conference in Ontario.  They are great, refillable and hard to find.  Highly recommend them.
5012 2018-12-05 17:00:35 Aren't you at a funeral service Donnie Boy? Did you have to get for Tweeting fix before or during the service?? And the world doesn't want to PAY higher oil prices. We don't need a repeat of the 70s oil embargo. Thank god the US is not totally dependent on OPEC.

5018 2018-12-05 17:00:16 Someone pls teach me how to do my own oil change 
5019 2018-12-05 17:00:15 About 3 years ago I was in a meeting with yyc oil&gas execs & ATB's Pres talking about the market. I was the only one in the room not thinking that oil will go past $80 for years to come bc of tech impact on supply. But no one ever thought the industry will be abandoned the feds.
5020 2018-12-05 17:00:12 We want it high. Our economy is oil dependent. Our Leader's are diversifying by looking for more oil in bokoharam enclave.
5021 2018-12-05 17:00:05 Is the math off? 225000 kilos at 4$ a gram is 900 mil??? That’s dry oil and extraction have better margins. What am I missing re:   operation?
5022 2018-12-05 16:59:55 YOU WONT BE SEEING OR NEEDING OIL PRICES WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN FEDERAL PRISON FOR COLLUSION WITH RUSSIANS TO FIX THE ELECTION!
5023 2018-12-05 16:59:48 Please don't use somuch oil it's costly. May suffer high crostorel problem. Take care of your health.
5024 2018-12-05 16:59:44 It’s not attacking a reporter to note that he spent the weekend basking in Bernie & the very next thing he does is go after Beto for oil/gas contributions that may be completely a non issue as you note. Odd timing or something else? Why isn’t that a fair question & not “attack”?
5025 2018-12-05 16:59:38 Nah...I bet the big oil fat cats loaded Beto’s pockets because they just LOVE Beto’s position on marijuana...and he’s cool because he was in a band & rides a skateboard!
5026 2018-12-05 16:59:36 What does this do to US oil companies? Especially small companies. 300 companies went belly-up just 3 years ago. Most companies in the USA need higher prices no matter how great low cost are to us. It is a catch 22.

5030 2018-12-05 16:59:28 Yes it was but has it happened under ur mentors before yes or no and how many years it took them despite all the oil boom ?during thier time should av bee taken of 00.2 type of inflation so don’t come and be bragging here..they were colossal
5031 2018-12-05 16:59:24 What you call vulgar show of lavish life style was Vijay Mallyas branding. It isnt vulgarly more than publicity budgets of Indian oil companies or Air India. When Air India is eating into Indian money, no complaints. Corrupt Bankers, no complaint. Vijay Mallya, everyone complains
5032 2018-12-05 16:59:24 Blood Oil. And what about the stock market?
5033 2018-12-05 16:59:18 Then we will take the oil instead of buying it. You know that we CAN and you can't do anything about it if we did.
5034 2018-12-05 16:59:12 Can't  speak about the missing oil...d cake is the side show to detract from the fact dat dem cyan call name.
5035 2018-12-05 16:59:11 I keep seeing this promoted in my feed, so here we go: if you or any other oil company have any shits more than lip service to these alternative energies, we’d have them at scale already. You have the resources to do way more to make these happen. Do that.
5036 2018-12-05 16:58:51 @Bee_Ahmad_ @M__nadya Ameen
5037 2018-12-05 16:58:43 Good thing it was not the deep fryer with oil in it
5038 2018-12-05 16:58:37 1.  You sent this an hour before the funeral.  

2.  North Dakota and Oklahoma want higher oil prices.
5039 2018-12-05 16:58:25 I don't know what motor oil tastes like, but that's what Blue Bottle coffee would compare too
5040 2018-12-05 16:58:23 Bayaran mo shark oil ko!!!!!
5041 2018-12-05 16:58:23 how extraordinary it is that two members of the same texas oil family could arise from such humble beginnings...
5042 2018-12-05 16:58:22 We can’t have it both ways... the answers aren’t as easy as use one and not another. We have to develop ways to capture and reuse chemicals and hazardous materials.  We never bat an eye about using our phones, yet coal, oil, and lithium to name 3 are used in their production.
5043 2018-12-05 16:58:14 Like the Oil and gas development you signed? Why pay for cleaning up other countries when we'll need to clean up our OWN after you're GONE!
5044 2018-12-05 16:58:14 The fact is because imports include raw materials the U.K. doesn't have ... it's not got Australia's iron mines or Japan's rare earth minerals ... then stuff that is exported have to pass on that supply costs. Even oil needed to transport goods.
5045 2018-12-05 16:58:12 Love those Oil & Gas CEOs. Just making 361 times more than workers.
5046 2018-12-05 16:58:08 @wayneschmidt Senator Schmidt you & your cronies are making MICHIGAN voters obsolete by your disgusting lame duck move to hurt voters rights, workers benefits,  gerrymandering, and selling the Mackinac Straights to a corporation who has already spilled oil in Lake Mich.  Hate you
5047 2018-12-05 16:58:02 Solve the mystery: Find the 600K+ barrels of oil. #PetrojamReport
5048 2018-12-05 16:57:58 sure is odd that the head of a political communications firm that specializes in "crisis response" is furiously spamming tweets about how Beto taking oil industry donations is perfectly okay

i bet he's being paid to do it
5049 2018-12-05 16:57:51 Yet the economic engine that is The US oil industry-led by TX, is hindered by the precipitous drop. Your tariffs are hurting our construction industry and the US auto industry. Your actions seem to have very little rhyme or economic reason and the markets see that. @GregAbbott_TX
5050 2018-12-05 16:57:50 your financial conflicts with Saudi Arabia are really becoming glaringly apparent. Higher per barrel oil prices help AMERICAN oil producers, and reduce our dependence on middle eastern oil.
5051 2018-12-05 16:57:43 My point;
Neither Dems OR Reps look out for the needs of poor/working/middle class people

They protect profits and war for oil
They tax the poor and hand it out to the rich

Just because one of them make you FEEL better when they do it, doesnt mean they dont do it.
5052 2018-12-05 16:57:35 Love this!   Thank you, Carl!    Missing ‘41 from Vienna tonight #OPEC #oott #oil
5053 2018-12-05 16:57:35 Just heard @RachelNotley give an interview on @CBCNews where she said that they'll move back to oil via rail economics in 1919. Clearly your mind is stuck in the 90s if you think oil is a long term solution for Canada.
5054 2018-12-05 16:57:31 Opening the border for ISIS fighters to move freely, buying oil, constantly bombing and invading Rojava, standing by and watching while ISIS was on the border for 3 years, supporting al-Nusra, an ISIS style terrorist group. Yeah sure man. Whatever you say.
5055 2018-12-05 16:57:27 Failure from taking action is a green light for others to abuse their power. A double standard for the sake of oil and stable economy brings a negative image to US as a world power.
5056 2018-12-05 16:57:22 I’ve heard 5 year olds talk about dinosaurs and shit being real. Scares the hell out of me every time.
5057 2018-12-05 16:57:20 Is it comparable to the infrastructure for coal and oil extraction and buring? How much steel and concrete is required to build railcars, oil rigs, power plants, pipelines?...
5058 2018-12-05 16:57:20 Yeah! With paddling pool & olive oil!
5059 2018-12-05 16:57:17 PNP aguh rinks out the cake, the parties and the missing oil come next election eenuh. Gear up.
5060 2018-12-05 16:57:15 Remember George H. W. Bush by throwing on some flannel and some boots and yelling “no blood for oil” at the top of your lungs all day.
5061 2018-12-05 16:57:09 Hada labo cleansing oil sebelah kanan sis
5062 2018-12-05 16:57:07 OPEC is not even the world leader of oil production INDIVIDUAL 1. 
Do better and Be Best!
5063 2018-12-05 16:57:06 Lips are dry, and so is my skin. Honestly hate winter time makes my skin so dry compared to summer where I get a lot of oil so keep my skin moist!
5064 2018-12-05 16:57:00 Someone just made +24.74% buy on WCX WTI Crude Oil 20x leverage @ 52.740 → 53.403  ~ GRANDIOSE $WTICO $USD
5065 2018-12-05 16:56:59 OPEC has no Bering on USA oil prices since we don’t belong to them. We are the largest producer on a daily production.
5066 2018-12-05 16:56:54 Donald- politics, oil cartels and economics don't run on hope, as you very well know.

OPEC of course will hike prices and it completely depends on you, the great USA, whether USA also becomes part of cartel or it increases supply of Shale oil production to contain prices.
5067 2018-12-05 16:56:51 10 gallons of anointing oil won't cure this guy
5068 2018-12-05 16:56:40 Good for consumers but not sure about the industry. When it drops too low a recession hurts the millions employed by big oil. Tricky balance, I imagine.
5069 2018-12-05 16:56:27 too much oil
5070 2018-12-05 16:56:25 I got the wrong train and I was too busy laughing about baby oil that I didn't realise
5071 2018-12-05 16:56:24 I smell like cooking oil  downside of havin food for life
5072 2018-12-05 16:56:17 So Obama Administration didnt;

Bailout criminal banksters?
Invade 7 additional countries?
Expand NSA Spying?
Advocate for torture?
Expand fracking, coal, and oil production?
Increase rates of childhood poverty?
Prosecute a record number of whistleblowers?
Remove habeas corpus?
5073 2018-12-05 16:56:13 Weh the 5 bil worth a oil deh?
5074 2018-12-05 16:56:09 Innalillahi wa inna ilaihi rajun. Allah ya jikanta
5075 2018-12-05 16:56:08 It’s a damn shame! You mean to tell me after losing so much oil not even a cake PCJ can get right? A damn lean cake for $1000? Damn shame!
5076 2018-12-05 16:56:03 ...and those so called civilians...Iranian backed Huthu are firing rockets into SA...Iran Qods Force Commanders lead Iraqi military forces...Iranian expansion is real. I don’t like SA either, but we need to be 100% oil independent before we throw out the baby w/ bath water.
5077 2018-12-05 16:55:54 Aah free radical carcinogenic boleh buat cancer. Ouh so apply based on technique la ye.

Isu jugak sekarang ni sebab harga sawit jatuh pasal diaorg banned palm oil kan.
5078 2018-12-05 16:55:53 I was gonna originally say "Is it because President Bush was an oil man?"  :)
5079 2018-12-05 16:55:51 Think how many jobs could have been produced in other sectors if tariff toad wasn’t wasting effort on trying to revive a dying one. We should be pushing to be a leader in future industries like solar instead of attempting to kill them to appease coal and oil donors
5080 2018-12-05 16:55:43 We also need to be free of foreign oil and, thusly, unsavory deals with foreign countries.
5081 2018-12-05 16:55:42 my confidence level on these oil wells exceeding OKRs is 100%
5082 2018-12-05 16:55:41 Certainly agree with you. There was a time when Trudeau Sr. was PM & wheat wasn't going anywhere. The farmers of western Canada asked for some help, not unlike the current issues with Sask &Ab oil. His response was very condescending. He thoroughly hated the west. Jr does too.
5083 2018-12-05 16:55:38 If the price so low there will not be infasment then the oil price will reach 300$ in the future
5084 2018-12-05 16:55:38 Please also check with American oil producers if they can live with a oil price at 45-50 I belief they have to refinance 500 Billion in debt due this year ..
5085 2018-12-05 16:55:38 going to put some oil in my car after work. usually have my dad or someone do it for me so idk how much to put in. should i just dump the whole liter in or is there a little line like the inside of a ramen noodle cup?
5086 2018-12-05 16:55:37 Because after a couple of centuries of using the hell out of it, no one knows how to use oil.
5087 2018-12-05 16:55:30 Why would anyone want another grifter Prez T’ urd between the oil fields and the pump — doesn’t make any sense.
5088 2018-12-05 16:55:29 イケアのシナモンロールが美味しかったです。
5089 2018-12-05 16:55:23 We’re drilling at a fraction of the time, two miles into the ground with extreme temperatures, and successfully capturing data... Optimizing data is the next step, & we’re investing heavily in data scientists over engineers. - Cindy Taylor, CEO, Oil State Int’l #HOUEconDev
5090 2018-12-05 16:55:20 Stop drilling you hit oil
5091 2018-12-05 16:55:18 Qatar's withdrawal has no direct and immediate impact over the oil market nor it has over OPEC, but... If a group of small producers decide to exit the cartel, then ii could decrease OPEC's influence in the market.
5092 2018-12-05 16:55:13 Connection to Papadop? Remember his area of expertise was oil. And then there’s the recently disclosed letter to Adam Schiff claiming Papadop was - in or about the same time period - bragging about being set for life.
5093 2018-12-05 16:55:08 What's under-recover sale cost?  And what's subsidy?. The simple true is, Nigeria PMS price is not market driven. Someone is subsidizing it, whether it's NNPC or oil Marketers it's a topic for another day. @MBuhari in that video does not believe we subsidize PMS, yet he does so.
5094 2018-12-05 16:55:04 hair chemist limited charcoal with citrus oil detoxifying hair treatment mask tastes horrible 5/5 stars do not recommend
5095 2018-12-05 16:55:03 Can anyone recommend to me any good oils for moisturizer and blemishes? Vitamin E doesn’t work anymore. Bio Oil worked for a little while.
5096 2018-12-05 16:55:03 Hey Tariff Man, throw a tariff on oil! That’ll show ‘em! Since you have so little knowledge on tariffs and no desire to learn, you would probably think it would show them.
5097 2018-12-05 16:54:55 If you'd pay attention to climate change, you'd see we need too be DECREASING our dependence on oil, not maintaining it.
5098 2018-12-05 16:54:55 It's all a farce. Oil is a commodity and the price is determined by demand, as evidenced by the price of gas jumping 50 cents overnight over this announcement from OPEC. Even though it wouldn't affect current demand or the price of gas already in reserve.

5104 2018-12-05 16:54:43 Oil waits for no man.
5105 2018-12-05 16:54:33 I hate when my beloved  potato  gets a bad rap. This professor  hasn't got a clue. God gave us this tubor for a reason. We humans have made it unhealthy by frying them in oil. If you air fry them and add healthy spices you have a winner. Don't listen to this man
5106 2018-12-05 16:54:22 Congratulations! Keep up the great work! Go Oil Caps Go!
5107 2018-12-05 16:54:20 LMAO
5108 2018-12-05 16:54:17 Obama took all that money and was pro-fracking, so you could say he was in the pocket of big oil & gas. But he also pushed hard for renewables, which they hate above all. These things are more complicated than "X took money from Y."
5109 2018-12-05 16:54:05 How when he was a wealthy oil man?

5117 2018-12-05 16:53:20 Mr. President, isn't the price gap between Western Canadian Select oil, and West Texas Intermediate, a problem for Canada? Something needs to be done, hence an announced cut in production. @usembassyottawa @lamphieryeg
5118 2018-12-05 16:53:17 Meanwhile in the Netherlands one is struggeling to come to an Climate Agreement, on the #CoP24 one is talking about Climate Finance and how we can shift from public finance in oil and gas to clean energy investments?! 'We should not shift we should run!'
5119 2018-12-05 16:53:16 I did, I use to work 2:30 pm- 2:30 am for about 14 months when Oil was booming.

5121 2018-12-05 16:53:14 Then he said....”thanks for the oil, send more Ive decimated our energy sector”
5122 2018-12-05 16:53:00 You do realize it takes oil to produce solar panels

5125 2018-12-05 16:52:27 Wrong. Oil is sold in US dollars.
5126 2018-12-05 16:52:22 there isn't much oil in petrolia any more so its safer
5127 2018-12-05 16:52:18 Even Today only three persons manipulating crude oil
5128 2018-12-05 16:52:14 Um, do you know that oil isn't a renewable resource so nobody has jurisdictions to how much it will keep flowing. We can use less of it so that there is gasoline in reserves.
5129 2018-12-05 16:52:06 Does he has a refinery cause oil is not gas, if it is oil that's missing
5130 2018-12-05 16:52:04 Then, as fierce as oil.
5131 2018-12-05 16:52:03 You do realize the U.S. & Canadian oil companies are overtaking the Saudis on oil production, right? You don't want higher oil prices … tell it to Texas oil companies to their faces!
5132 2018-12-05 16:52:02 To be fair, there are a lot more people pumping gas in their car than people in the oil industry. $5 a barrel sounds good to me.
5133 2018-12-05 16:51:58 We actually don't NEED oil but have you noticed the instability of Wall Street?

Wonder if your wealthy friends are benefitting from your psychotic tweets?

IA should be looking at Insider Trading following any communication you might have.
5134 2018-12-05 16:51:56 Saudi-US bilateral oil sales aren’t relevant. SA is the largest exporter to world markets making it aplayer that can influence prices.Iran can’t!SA can also simply demand that oil be sold in Gold instead of US$. We’ll see how mighty it is then.The biggest gun doesn’t always win
5135 2018-12-05 16:51:52 YEAH! Lets try and say insulting things! Who cares that; 

50% of the country makes $30k or less

5142 2018-12-05 16:51:30 Was it not mighty Ecuador that threatened to ramp up production a few days back?

I guess they knew their place in oil production now

5150 2018-12-05 16:50:53 Liar.

You'r letting Big Oil drill in places they shouldn't due to environmental impact, and you lifted Emissions Regulations on refineries, thus allowing them to pump more pollution into the air than in the past 2 decades.

Oh, and OPEC will not call for your advice on oil prices and supply. I am fairly certain of it.

Its about control.

Once Tech is mature, US cant stop it from proliferating to China, EU, etc, while it can control oil flows and its prices.

Without energy control, US cant police the world.

If a monk with Purity of Body took his hands (or handwraps) and dipped them in a contact poison like Oil of Taggit and then punched someone with it, would the target then be afflicted with the poison effects? Seems like it would.
5221 2018-12-05 16:45:38 There remain discussions about SMRs in the oil sands. But with so much natural gas in Alberta, I doubt it. Saskatchewan, on the other hand, is a different matter.

Link oil production and prices to the IMF

5236 2018-12-05 16:44:57 Glad to see Woodie Guthrie made the cut. For your consideration next year:  Eight Days a Week by the (late, lamented) Bobs, and the Dreidel Song by (equally late and equally lamented) DaVinci’s Notebook. Too many songs, too little menorah oil.
5237 2018-12-05 16:44:55 Using coconut oil to whiten your teeth was a philosophy that gained steam too. Guess what, it ended up being a stinking pile of .
5238 2018-12-05 16:44:53 The US is a major oil producer.  Higher prices help our domestic production and our energy independence.  Of course we have to balance that against higher transportation costs.  Gee, who knew being president would be so hard.
5239 2018-12-05 16:44:50 Huge , you implement and cheer-lead a massive carbon tax (pay up or the planet gets it!!), shut down coal production, fossil energy plants, then push increase oil pipelines and oil sands production. That's crazy you can't be on both sides of an argument!!

5241 2018-12-05 16:44:44 Shale oil is absolutely one of the worst industries in existence. Why didn't you include in the report how a CEO of a shale oil company refused to allow the company to drill on a deposit anywhere near his house. It's ok for him but not others. #shaleoilsux

5244 2018-12-05 16:44:30 It's looming, I read a news about oil marketers demanding their subsidy payment. Threatening to shut down.
5245 2018-12-05 16:44:30 But higher oil prices are better for the economy,  especially in Texas.  I'm not sure about Trump's logic.  It is short sighted.

5247 2018-12-05 16:44:23 So real ting. Is this why illegal gas stations have existed for years and years?.
The missing oil is processed and sold on the black market?
And we pay higher pump prices at legitimate stations to offset these losses?
Can someone explain?
5248 2018-12-05 16:44:11 A complete transmission service - 100% of the oil is drained/oil filter is replaced - is recommended for cars with 100,000 miles or more.
5249 2018-12-05 16:44:08 @iamUncleJohn you ever tried that? The pomade shit never worked for me i just used simple shit like olive oil and shit
5250 2018-12-05 16:43:53 ...and they do it well and use it constantly. I’ve saw Obama the other day taking credit for gas prices being low and America’s oil independence. These people are delusional, have no shame and the Democrat sheep eat it up.
5251 2018-12-05 16:43:51 Backtrack to when JM n Pep first took over the their respective Manchester Clubs. I'd love to see how things would have panned out if the Clubs had each others owners at that point- Glazers at City, Oil merchants at Utd. (ignoring human rights issues) Massive difference imo.

5255 2018-12-05 16:43:45 Big Oil doesn’t want you to know how they’re shifting the plates directly underneath you.

5257 2018-12-05 16:43:34 Pretty solid - fish oil not krill, krill is dilute in #omega3 but sometimes I take squid oil as it’s high in #DHA plus botanicals - maca, cats claw, Berberine & curcumin and yes #vitaminD
5258 2018-12-05 16:43:32 But the people that own that oil can do whatever they want with it! They want to make as much money off of it as they can! Time to get away from oil altogether! Support alternative energy now! Save the planet from trump and the oil companies!
5259 2018-12-05 16:43:31 Oil on your head........
5260 2018-12-05 16:43:30 She should be talking to the rich ass Globalist ,the ones who made all there money from fossil fuels and suppressed new technologies that tried to make oil alternative energy and even had some scientist killed
5261 2018-12-05 16:43:27 If you don't like the oil come from the oilsands and then why do you still take our money you hypocrite
5262 2018-12-05 16:43:26 The world needs an end to oil, maybe work on giving out subsidies to find it
5263 2018-12-05 16:43:19 Big Oil hates EVs!
The EV industry needs our help—Call 833-216-1727 and urge your senator to support the Electric CARS Act and the EV tax credit program.

5280 2018-12-05 16:42:25 Meanwhile, Petrol price goes Rs. 75.30, comparatively it seems to be Cheapest in the span of 8 months. Even now I don't even know who is responsible for the key of oil pricing. Weather The Govt or an MNC which participate in those, however it is doable.
5281 2018-12-05 16:42:23 Steps to reduce the Dollar dependency. Direct Trade agreements, Barter trade like Oil for Rice with Iran, Currency Swap with Japan & now with UAE.

5286 2018-12-05 16:41:52 Bros under recoveries or what ever u call it is not the main issue money is being paid and in ur opinion not to oil marketers but down the drain. Our economy was tiped to go into another recession by the governor of CBN.
5287 2018-12-05 16:41:43 I was under the impression that #naturalhair had to do with what you put on it or do to it, so I stripped back my routing to castile soap and coconut oil to find my "natural texture" thinking I must have fun curls, since I had so much frizz. BUT it turns out....
5288 2018-12-05 16:41:36 This is simply not true. Solar panels and wind turbines have more long term value than a barrel of oil. They arguably retain more value than most other physical possessions.
5289 2018-12-05 16:41:33 Me too  I’ve been drinking juice and teas as well as Pseudophedrine and Claritin... I hate meds but if you can’t juice (fresh pressed wheat grass, ginger, cilantro oil, lemon juice) until your better, use some meds.

5292 2018-12-05 16:41:20 @realDonaldTrump should back off of OPEC.  We can’t ask them to take a sub-standard price for their oil production.  We have got to be fair to our energy producers including those in the USA!  Remember all those high paying driller jobs!  We need a “fair” price.
5293 2018-12-05 16:41:15 no matter how many times i tell my mom i can’t handle the stench nor the taste when she panfries stuff with olive oil she keeps on using it. don’t complain abt my bad mood when you won’t listen to me, and don’t complain abt wasting money either
5294 2018-12-05 16:41:10 @JustinTrudeau This could be CANADIAN oil!!!!  Get the pipeline & terminal built!  For ALL of CANADA!!!
5295 2018-12-05 16:41:03 Who the flip cares? We get around 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. Qater is jumping out. Canada, our largest supplier and Mexico are not members of OPEC. Mr. Donald, you should be busting ass to get more supply from these three countries. Cut the Saudi MURDERERS totally off!
5296 2018-12-05 16:41:02 i have started using clay masks and aloe vera. will add lavender oil too! thanks man
5297 2018-12-05 16:40:59 Can you make your point without misrepresenting the facts?  Beto took money from individuals that work in the oil fields, not Big Oil.  This is a huge distinction, even if it does undermine half your argument.

5299 2018-12-05 16:40:51 The Federal Government profits more from the oil industry than the actual industry. Put the people first and end these taxes.

5306 2018-12-05 16:40:18 I absolutely have that question, too. I can’t imagine that gas near oil is safe. My thinking is that he either didn’t have time to burn OR he planned to after work (storing evidence in bins) —- he was thwarted at the dump site by coworkers coming and NA at his house.

5314 2018-12-05 16:40:02 America can produce all the energy it needs right at home. America doesn't need foreign oil. America actually exports more energy than it imports. Stop exporting energy. Problem solved.
5315 2018-12-05 16:39:23 Yep, just another writer, probs jealous of what in reality big oil actually brings & does- regardless of the extras and donations-  who probably couldn’t make it in working in the industry, which would most likely double his yearly income.
5316 2018-12-05 16:39:22 "Hopefully."

Um, your mob boss Putin most definitely wants higher oil prices.  It's the only thing that brings in money to Russia.  You are working for the wrong team @realDonaldTrump and EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
5317 2018-12-05 16:39:20 You need both. Any person with common sense knows we need clean renewable energy. But we also need low oil prices to get off the ground. There is also another factor. Even clean energy requires materials harvested from earth to work.

5351 2018-12-05 16:37:13 In 50 years we’ll harness the sun’s energy and the only use for oil will be plastics - not for burning. Then if the climate warmers are right we’ll stop warming (or cooling) the planet. Till then think we should slow down the rush to overpopulate the coastal areas of the world?
5352 2018-12-05 16:37:11 It's quite beautiful! Reminds me of oil pastels.

Now u hv to burn midnight's oil to save the hand that fed you for so long.
5355 2018-12-05 16:37:02 You need low oil prices too. Materials for components are high. Low oil prices helps companies get off the ground. Also gives companies and individuals $ to invest. We need both.
5356 2018-12-05 16:37:01 My boyfriend is helping a friend do a commercial for their hot sauce and they're not shaving their beards until the end of JANUARY. SO BASICALLY FOREVER. And I'm distraught. Long beards HURT when you kiss them  He did buy beard oil, so hopefully that helps.

5360 2018-12-05 16:36:34 Fair question but it’s both. Our primary non-renewable fuel is LSFO. The commitment was made back when oil prices were astronomically high as a way to decouple from market prices out of our control.
5361 2018-12-05 16:36:34 Did you know that we export more oil now than we import? Or at least we did when @BarackObama  was our President..Who knows what happens now!!
5362 2018-12-05 16:36:33 Coba biore cleansing oil
5363 2018-12-05 16:36:33 Ah! Guess it wasn’t stripped and checked before this fire-up :(. But given fuel you are running on isn’t normally tested for lubricity (as it’s heating oil) I would do something to stop a repeat in future
5364 2018-12-05 16:36:27 You want oil, because its money the oil companies want. They do Not care about our planet. You know we can do better than that.  Invest in CLEAN, RENEWABLE energy. Maybe read up on Nikola Tesla. He had great ideas. I'm sure the government has his stolen work hidden somewhere. 
5365 2018-12-05 16:36:27 Don’t forget to take your fish oil today it’s so cold and dry or as peta would say blahdibloobeeeenonsensegrbg
5366 2018-12-05 16:36:24 Because our anti American media wants Gods children  to remain sleeping. They don't want us to here that wake up call like the ten virgins. 10 had lamps,wicks, went to sleep, woke up, aware of events, but 5 who had no oil realized they were NOT ready as the other 5 who left.
5367 2018-12-05 16:36:21 Companies pay the maintenance costs of all other inputs, as well. If a piece of tech stops working, they pay to fix it. They pay for lubricating oil to keep mechanical parts running. But they ask the government to pay for the costs of keeping workers and their families alive.
5368 2018-12-05 16:36:21 He wouldn't b doing this job if he was.  He cares more about the country becoming wealthy more at this point.  Morgan's & Rothschilds used to run the oil, coal, railroads & people suffered tremendously, often dying on the job.  They run the banks & media,
5369 2018-12-05 16:36:10 If you would like to be added to my private group regarding CBD oil, please like the post or comment below. You could message me too, if that's better for you. 
5370 2018-12-05 16:36:08 I doubt we as a country are, but those that get money from these already mega rich oil companies are sure keeping that from happening. When the GOP says they want "small government" what they are really saying is, we don't want watchdogs keeping us from our goals of being richer.
5371 2018-12-05 16:35:57 Lush has stated they’re staunchly opposed to the oil sands, so Albertans impacted by the downturn are _losing it_ on them. It’s understandable, but I don’t think they realize they’re being used.

5380 2018-12-05 16:35:35 Reuters reported that Russia has agreed to reduce its oil output in tandem with OPEC and its allies in 2019. "Debates about figures and baseline for cuts still ongoing," Reuters added.

Also, On this day of mourning, Trump should keep quiet and quit tweeting.

5387 2018-12-05 16:35:19 Since the oil & gas sector employs upwards of a million people in Texas, it would be amazing if oil & gas employees were NOT among Beto's contributors.

5389 2018-12-05 16:35:00 Turkey can also use nuclear weapons, trade in cheap oil over Turkey takes precedence over milions of civilians.... of course ironically 
5390 2018-12-05 16:35:00 Right Iranians are a lot more modern that Saudis. Wahabism is ISIS doctrine. It is Saudi mentality. Very backward. Persians have a lot to offer to the world. KSA only blood money. Iranian oil taste a lot better.

5392 2018-12-05 16:34:56 I just took a two hour nap in the car dealership...

1. I’m shook at how tired I had to be to fall asleep in a car showroom. 

2. Im confused as to why the hell it’s taking them two hours to change my damn oil.
5393 2018-12-05 16:34:35 OPEC or not. What many don’t realize is the price of oil needs to remain low if the goal is renewable energy. In order to revolutionize energy, shipping prices need to remain stable. So alternative energy companies have the ability to gain ground. Prices of materials are high.
5394 2018-12-05 16:34:30 THEY HAVE. Trump is trying to undo that nonsense. He's tried to get us out of the Middle East. He started no war for oil. McCain, and the CIA/NWO created ISIS had to set up a gassing to keep us there. Most of us want oyr troops home. Screw the rest of the world. Ingrates.
5395 2018-12-05 16:34:19 Bro all that man cared about was fucking up the Middle East and getting that oil nick Jonas and his wife giving people hope and happiness
5396 2018-12-05 16:34:18 Renewable is the future.  You know it.  I know it.  Quit prattling on about oil.  You don't have "multiple projects" or you would be working on them instead of making up Lies about oil on Twitter for some reason.

5412 2018-12-05 16:33:19 DID I HEAR OIL!!?!?
5413 2018-12-05 16:33:12 Yes your babies so gorgeous man! Chocolate kings  I hear it’s a great moisturizer, but also good for acne prone skin so I want to add it to my night routine since it’s an oil.

5415 2018-12-05 16:32:55 At least develop alternative energy sources to depend only on our domestic oil production which additionally would be friendlier to our environment by default.

5421 2018-12-05 16:32:29 Well, here’s the twist...even if it doesn’t go up, the dollar is dropping because of your BS, which means the price of oil will still go up relative to the value of the dollar even if they don’t actually raise the price per barrel!
5422 2018-12-05 16:32:29 Your domestic oil producing states would strenuously disagree.

5427 2018-12-05 16:32:15 Called Honda to ask how much it would cost for transmission oil change they said $130. Went and got a quote from a shop down bird rd they said $80. I called my man and he found someone to do it for $40.. why do I even try to get shit done on my own?
5428 2018-12-05 16:32:13 Remeber about 8-10 years ago we were running out of oil. The public was hysterical. Well here we are in the future with more oil than we know what to do with.
5429 2018-12-05 16:32:10 All of this would be fine if pipelines were in place to allow supply and demand to balance. But storage is full, no value for the oil owner (Alberta) to keep producing excess. Now the resulting price difference to market is captured by refiners and not passed on consumers.
5430 2018-12-05 16:32:08 The Arabian rulers are unspeakably horrible, tyrannical and evil. Oil is their grip on our leaders and wealthy.

5432 2018-12-05 16:31:59 They should pay the miners not to mine it.  Like Alaska's oil dividend.  Of course, the Blankenship's and Peabody's of the world would take most of the money.
5433 2018-12-05 16:31:58 I would like these 3% of scientists to come out and explain their ideas. Are they really scientists?  Are they paid by oil? How can they be such curmudgeons? Do they think that we have no impact or little or some?
5434 2018-12-05 16:31:57 oil prices are determined literally months ahead of time. Production is estimated to meet demand, this year they estimated more than people used, which caused prices to drop.

5438 2018-12-05 16:31:46 Oil serves no other purpose than to aid mankind.

This is why all types, particularly mineral oil petroleum which is a crucial source to our economy, is always attacked by the progressives. 

It also fuels (no pun intended) their cause when God anointed His people with oil.
5439 2018-12-05 16:31:42 Also, oil companies doing the fracking still do not have to tell you what they chemicals they are using to frack. Why was it removed from the platform.

5444 2018-12-05 16:31:22 Interesting to see Kennedy's notes from cabinet in Nov 2010.  Many of claims made were false  at the time.  No discussion of import alternative although they recognised cheap power in NB/NS.  And intention to use oil cash to cover 25%.  1/2 #nlpoli
5445 2018-12-05 16:31:21 Hope oil prices drop well below $50.00 a barrel and puts American oil companies out of business. Keep the oil in the ground. Environment more important than jobs in a dirty industry.

5460 2018-12-05 16:30:25 Canada is where most of US oil imports come from. Canada is cutting production (Alberta). Cutting production is how prices are increased. Canada in not part of OPEC. Get it together. Unless you are concerned for the Chinese, worry about what Canada is doing.

5488 2018-12-05 16:28:15 *OMAN OIL MINISTER SAYS OPEC COULD AGREE 1M B/D PRODUCTION CUTS
5489 2018-12-05 16:28:10 Nor should it need oil
The world should focus efforts on a clean renewable energy source
5490 2018-12-05 16:28:01 70 dollar oil change before a fkn trip lolol ouch
5491 2018-12-05 16:28:01 *OMAN OIL MINISTER SAYS ENOUGH TIME TO AGREE ON OPEC CUT NUMBER (yes they are waiting for the end of the funeral.... for authorization)
5492 2018-12-05 16:27:57 Yeah he really nailed Beto for taking no super pac money but money from people who work in oil in gas from a state where that’s the largest employer he’s a true trail blazer
5493 2018-12-05 16:27:50 Well re-election is a long way away, think two things - to slow Fed raising rates and secondly is playing the popular nod for other purposes - unless there is a bigger play here have to say has no clue that too low oil prices damage O&G sector
5494 2018-12-05 16:27:31 I wore a suit to work today with the dolce tie, YSL cologne, scarf, coconut oil on the skin and beard, couple dollars in my pocket.  I feel like going to a Black owned beauty salon to watch them salivate.
5495 2018-12-05 16:27:10 Absolutely correct!  All commodities are priced in dollars, so everything requiring oil to aluminum to zinc, coffee, chocolate, bananas, etc., will increase in price even if tariffs aren't involved.
5496 2018-12-05 16:27:06 Gas is cheap as hell in the us.  You know nothing about high oil prices.
5497 2018-12-05 16:27:00 And if the world’s oil price rises again (as it surely will) will you, Donald J Trump, take ownership of being a economic failure just as quickly as you took ownership of being a economic “smart guy” while the oil price impacts the pockets of every mom and dad??

5504 2018-12-05 16:26:33 Oil is priced/purchased with money. Only purchased when the end user has a need to use it. Oil's killer app is the internal combustion engine. Does digital oil have it's killer app yet?
5505 2018-12-05 16:26:29 @BTPEssex can you possibly point me to the laws on obtaining & carrying CBD oil containing THC in the UK please as I understand the laws changed earlier on this year? I mean cannabis oil for medicinal purposes not for smoking! thank you
5506 2018-12-05 16:26:22 Don’t we get just like 10% of our oil from them?
5507 2018-12-05 16:26:20 Remember he thousands who died because of this man remember my Friends who died in Iraq for fake wmds for the oil companies f them all #Remembering41
5508 2018-12-05 16:26:08 Sorry but the whole purpose of a wind turbine is to create electricity, they are run by the wind. and yes many went bankrupt but many are still going, however Trump is making it very difficult for them to push oil for his associates, thus killing many new jobs

5514 2018-12-05 16:25:46 Oil & gas is probably the biggest employer in Texas and definitely the biggest employer in Harris County. Beto took money from people employed by oil and gas companies, not from oil and gas companies... so yeah.
5515 2018-12-05 16:25:34 Guy next to me at the Oil place is watching a live feed of the funeral, on loud. I’m on twitter watching all the funny clips of Trump looking like an idiot
5516 2018-12-05 16:25:30 Hopefully nice rise in oil now should inc volume
5517 2018-12-05 16:25:29 There's just something so romantic about the changing of seasons and how my coconut oil has gone from the consistency of water to being as hard as concrete.
5518 2018-12-05 16:25:25 Palm oil is found in more than half of all supermarket products, from bread, pastry, biscuits, cereal and chocolate to soap and detergent. Check for it, and don't buy it. Tell the supermarkets to change.
5519 2018-12-05 16:25:24 No.
Nothing seems to work and I don't know I hate wasted more money on things that probably won't work either. I should try CBD oil. I don't think I want to vape anyting.

5520 2018-12-05 16:25:21 Ugh I need to learn how to blend oil paint to properly look like skin and not brush strokes, good oil paintings can be so gorgeous
5521 2018-12-05 16:25:21 #RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
5522 2018-12-05 16:25:17 @realDonaldTrump Get ready to Leave Opec.  Oil is there and You will see.  Ring of Fire.
5523 2018-12-05 16:25:16 I am in the UK and can only have cannabis oil with 0.2% or less THC for it to be legal. Yeah I will be so angry if this happens worldwide
5524 2018-12-05 16:25:09 1973. Oil Embargo.  Very cold winter. Scientists quite convinced we were at start of a new ice age.
5525 2018-12-05 16:25:07 Your choice of words are yours, but there should be equity and sense of maturity in dealing with people, am not your slave, if I respect you, then you should learn to reciprocate that.
5526 2018-12-05 16:25:05 We produce 40% of our oil needs at home. The rest we import from Canada, Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Saudi Arabia.
We don't need to condone killing of journalists for oil.
5527 2018-12-05 16:24:59 .@BILDAlberta also says that the oil crisis in the province has created a ripple effect, greatly impacting Albertans decisions to buy new homes. @CityNewsYEG #Alberta #yeg #yyc
5528 2018-12-05 16:24:58 You’re a snake oil merchant and a charlatan.
5529 2018-12-05 16:24:53 Tell them spoil me. I need some oil money too!
5530 2018-12-05 16:24:45 I suspect that oil companies in countries like the US, the biggest producer of oil, would disagree. 
Shale oil is not economically viable under a certain price. 
Simple economics passes this moron by, apparently.

sad
5531 2018-12-05 16:24:40 You might learn things like- the French riots are NOT a response to “rising energy prices” ( since crude oil is at a year low) like @cnn reports, but actually because of increased climate tax.
5532 2018-12-05 16:24:40 Just got a 'Holiday Savings' promo from my local car service/tire shop. Six free oil changes for only $99.
5533 2018-12-05 16:24:31 What if digital money is created by digital oil?
5534 2018-12-05 16:24:24 MR Walkom nowhere in your article did you mention what should be done for all of these workers who would lose their jobs.   Also I guess since Alberta and the federal govt will lose billions in revenue from oil royalties and income tax what social programs will we do away with?
5535 2018-12-05 16:24:22 Your wife is being lied to. They told my wife the same thing.....for 6 years she was on fentanyl patches, OxyContin and heavy doses of steroids......all that is gone thanks to rick Simpson oil and other forms of cannabis.
5536 2018-12-05 16:24:20 It's almost like we need to invest in alternatives to oil so the populace isn't  at the mercy of a cartel of oil producing nations.
5537 2018-12-05 16:24:20 My dad left this morning to get his oil changed and came home in a new truck
5538 2018-12-05 16:24:20 So what you’re say here is that my plate of prosciutto, burrata drizzled with olive oil is supremely heart-healthy.
5539 2018-12-05 16:24:15 All the oil won't last 50 more years. We need a better long term solution that won't kill the planet. And....today is definitely not about you, but about a real president.
5540 2018-12-05 16:24:05 Beef I'd rather avoid it, it's pointless
But I've been poisoned..by the manor I be living in' manna wanna kill and ting like we live where the oil is, my bloods boiling man wanna wet me up but ive been anointed SO my only choice is
5541 2018-12-05 16:24:01 #Obummer was recently @RiceUniversity ‘I signed the #ParisAccord’ (applause) Also Obummer, ‘Domestic oil production increased under me’ (applause) Tis a true gift talking out of both sides of your mouth. #GreenNewDeal #ActOnClimate #NeedANewParty
5542 2018-12-05 16:23:59 Yet @theresa_may keeps banging on the drum of delivering the vote. It was tainted to create a bias towards a conservative motion . Now, after people have become more educated over #brexit, people don't want it. It's snake oil, an IOD, on the road of democracy.

5543 2018-12-05 16:23:58 I have to mute all of you now. Thanks
5544 2018-12-05 16:23:52 If Trump is doing the deal , that's about right.

5546 2018-12-05 16:23:46 Very little to discuss. The end game for Trudeau is the demise of what he calls the "tar sands" oil development. 
Discussing this is a waste of time, other then keeping this on the national front page, embarrassing him before the next election.
5547 2018-12-05 16:23:43 Yes. Thanks for your Efforts to curb oil prices.
If they reduce output, please, USA should increase output. More trust in you.
5548 2018-12-05 16:23:38 Yes the world does need higher oil prices to force the world to face the reality of climate change. There are alternatives
5549 2018-12-05 16:23:37 Oil run the world , do the maths 
5550 2018-12-05 16:23:35 Paid for spring classes, got my oil changed, and now Dunkin... all before noon.
5551 2018-12-05 16:23:24 Ok we’ll take canada  oil at $80 our “oil strategy” to keep it in the ground until the price stabilizes and until it does stay out of canada Alberta Saskatchewan affairs

5553 2018-12-05 16:23:13 Because there is a fallacy that going to renewables means loss of coal and oil jobs here. Plus it is easier to pander to these groups of workers than to get them to know the truth about renewables
5554 2018-12-05 16:23:08 As a Canadian myself, I can tell you that's the general consensus here.  There are a couple provinces (where the oil is) that don't like him much, and would prefer someone closer to Trump, but in such a vast country, the rest of us don't really interact with them very often.
5555 2018-12-05 16:23:06 I want him to call for a "gender based analysis" of the oil being imported into Saint John, New Brunswick at the Irving Oil Refinery.  He demanded it for the Energy East pipeline that would have brought Canadian oil there.  But no such scrutiny of Saudi oil imported there.
5556 2018-12-05 16:23:01 Higher price of oil politics may destroy the regime of OPEC countries because oil is not only ultimate  needs of people. World communities are very conscious about oil politics.
5557 2018-12-05 16:23:00 Good gift for me would be for somebody to get my oil changed and tires rotated those the type of gifts I want

5561 2018-12-05 16:22:37 Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I guess I equate capitalism with Wall Street, big oil, big pharmacy, massive corporations that care only about wealth & profit at any cost and at the expense of the poor. I agree that Jesus was neither.

5571 2018-12-05 16:21:27 Would you rather change the oil in your car and keep the same oil filter or change the oil filter and just top off your oil??

5573 2018-12-05 16:21:23 I thought the bankers are in the banking business, the politicians are in the politic business, what happen that all them become the thief of the oil?
5574 2018-12-05 16:21:16 I mean he basically rolled out the red carpet by supporting clinton from the jump and keeping the public in the dark about Russia's controlling interest in the now seated president. Too proud of all the oil the US is pumping to worry about Donald much.

5578 2018-12-05 16:20:57 Railcars are not the way. Everyone knows this but this is the only alternative that Aberta has been forced into. The Univeristy of Calgary came up with a method to turn the oil into solid tiny hockey pucks... more expensive yes but i would say manageable. I saw this article...
5579 2018-12-05 16:20:56 i almost blew up the kitchen because i dropped a can of oil on top of the burning stove 
5580 2018-12-05 16:20:51 I generally support your success DT as it is America’s success, but please stop this nonsense. 60-70$ oil is good for US jobs and economy as well as the consumers. Oil should not go lower than it is, and shouldn’t go above 80$. There is a happy medium—don’t hurt your US workers!
5581 2018-12-05 16:20:48 1965,That was the biggest mistake we made bring their camel riding children to america to educate them with college and economics...they learned to unight their oil countries together and that would have the world by the testecals...

5587 2018-12-05 16:19:56 Oil is having an enormous up day, almost reclaiming yesterday's losses. Driven by OPEC whispers and Libya's closed ports. Ignoring Trump's pressure tactics. For now. In dutch: (H)OLIE (M)OLIE !!
5588 2018-12-05 16:19:53 Digital Oil is a bigger market opportunity than Digital Gold but not Digital Money.
5589 2018-12-05 16:19:49 It’s not just the resources needed but it’s the testicular fortitude to stand up to big oil.
5590 2018-12-05 16:19:45 3.  And of course, it goes without saying that a pure democracy would underrepresent the unique local issues of the entire rest of the country at a national level.  Ex. NY and California are not going to give a damn about Texas oil if it gets in the way of there Climate Program.
5591 2018-12-05 16:19:40 A million barrels of oil...but 500,000 of them go missing under @RRamirezVE's watch; another 499,999 to get shipped China, leaving only 1 for you. Also, all the refineries are crumbling, so you have to ship your one barrel to Trinidad to get gasoline. Merry X-mas, @NicolasMaduro!
5592 2018-12-05 16:19:36 There was a machine I loved as a kid - the donut shop had a window on their kitchen & you could watch the machine as it squeezed out a ring of batter which plopped, FIZZ! right into the hot oil. No holes there! 
5593 2018-12-05 16:19:24 which is funny as Left in Canada does not protest oil by rail or OPEC tankers arriving daily or pipelines for OPEC oil in Canada, they only protest pipelines for Cdn oil.
5594 2018-12-05 16:19:15 Then why are you ready to decimate the Alaskan wilderness for more polluting oil?

5605 2018-12-05 16:18:30 What about the oil producers in the U.S.A.?  Don't they want higher oil prices to keep pumping shale oil?  Think things through Trump before you start to tweet. Trump really isn't that smart.

All Hail Emperor Trump!
5606 2018-12-05 16:18:28 Why aren't we using our own oil?
5607 2018-12-05 16:18:24 And yet, despite the supposed universal availability of oil money and its profligate use to supposedly buy everything...the Spanish giants still have higher (state supported) payrolls.

5768 2018-12-05 16:07:34 In ‘85 I returned from CA, told Steve Austen: L.A. place to be! He said, focus was on TX, “Talk to Rudy Engelander.” Then oil went down -> NL lost interest in TX, but wasn’t ready for CA. I went to AusTx anyway, the rest is history. What’s next? Seattle? Am here already  :-)

5773 2018-12-05 16:07:13 Alberta should stop sending oil to B.C. Watch how fast Trudeau jumps to attention.
5774 2018-12-05 16:07:10 You thick in the head, he has cause economic growth and lowering taxes. And you’re here tellin me a man who declared war on the notion of them having weapons of mass destruction and not actually possessing them is a better man. How many innocent lives were lost? For what, OIL?
5775 2018-12-05 16:07:10 Damn i wanted to deep condition and hot oil my hair tonight but i work late again 
5776 2018-12-05 16:07:10 Is the federal government doing enough to build pipelines and help Alberta through its oil crisis? I'm asking @salhousser and @amrazment on @SXMCanadaTalks #SiriusXM 167 #cdnpoli
5777 2018-12-05 16:06:53 Earth, the only habitable planet, needs a high oil price.

Our future economy needs a  high oil price.

Next quarter's economic growth report and your teenytiny chances of winning the 2020 presidential election, on the other hand, need a low oil price.

Try being honest, #crook.
5778 2018-12-05 16:06:52 After 9-11, a DC client hired me 2 build report between US-Saudi Arabia; Louisiana industries wanted to salvage SOME relationship. After the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, I'm thinking...how much latitude do we give this nation just for the sake of oil? Or is this about Israel? 
5779 2018-12-05 16:06:45 Would require lots of ocean based windmills at several million dollars per unit. 

It's most expensive energy alternative. Only funded by Norway's smart Sovereign Wealth Fund. 1% of every major stock....Land assets and National plus foreign oil investments.
5780 2018-12-05 16:06:44 Mr. President, are you aware the protesters in Paris are chanting Trump! Trump! Trump!  The world needs affordable energy - bring oil prices down!
5781 2018-12-05 16:06:37 Honor will return. Wounds will heal. Life will go on. The impact of denying global warming very possibly will kill millions. This current oil & coal lobbyist fuelled administration will go down in history as the shift to Armageddon, unless action taken now. Unlikely.
5782 2018-12-05 16:06:29 Well, we all would do better if we clearly condemned violence no matter the end. Shell, BP, Total and main other oil majors know that there is huge global support for cutting carbon emissions in keeping with what science says must be done to prevent dangerous levels of warming.
5783 2018-12-05 16:06:27 "scented oil"

5786 2018-12-05 16:06:15 'Reducing oil output' in 2019 could mean simply maintaining existing prod cut agreement.
5787 2018-12-05 16:06:13 A female future lasts until the next oil change.
5788 2018-12-05 16:06:03 ...well.... oil is doing well! Should have piled in at ~$49. I thought $45 was the target. Bollocks.
5789 2018-12-05 16:06:02 Yes. The local black soap mixed with cinnamon, coconut oil a dash of honey and water.
5790 2018-12-05 16:06:01 How about put oil on it properly then it will 
5791 2018-12-05 16:06:00 The oil deh a the gas station a Spanish Town
5792 2018-12-05 16:05:58 When we compare fossil fuel prices with the untold costs on the earth’s ecosystems, oil prices are way, way to cheap. But Dim Don is incapable of understanding such complex issues.
5793 2018-12-05 16:05:43 It’s the lack of palm oil.
5794 2018-12-05 16:05:40 It completely disconnected from oil too
5795 2018-12-05 16:05:33 shukar hai yae nahi kaha k my first # oil painting
5796 2018-12-05 16:05:33 If Trump really wanted to make America great again he'd make synthetic oil changes for cars cheaper. I don't have an extra $50+ dollars laying around for a damn oil change.
5797 2018-12-05 16:05:30 That's it.
5798 2018-12-05 16:05:26 Actually, the world needs less oil, less coal, and more clean, renewable energy.
5799 2018-12-05 16:05:25 That expanding oil supply from Clair Ridge somehow keeps coal in the ground somewhere else, rather than simply increasing global emissions, seems quite an optimistic assumption!

Stop talking crap! !!
5806 2018-12-05 16:04:45 Oil is not infinite. Just like coal is not infinite. We need to move to renewable energy sources and limit dependence on oil and other nonrenewable resources. We need to stop living in the past, accept reality and move forward! We should be leaders, not followers, in progress!
5807 2018-12-05 16:04:44 Your priorities are screwed up, more important than oil prices is keeping the world liveable by dealing with climate change, making sure people have access to quality health care, quality education and housing.  That we maintain our international relationship with our allies !
5808 2018-12-05 16:04:43 Olive oil!!
5809 2018-12-05 16:04:38 They already announced that they will restrict oil in the next few months. This tweet won’t coerce OPEC at all!
5810 2018-12-05 16:04:37 I am pulling its strings. Lol

"Trumps in church and can't tweet now, lets cut"
5815 2018-12-05 16:04:24 Of course the whole party thing is abysmal behaviour and is a disgrace .. but obviously there are those with an agenda that would want everyone to focus on the party & not on the entire barrels of oil fiasco, which is major in comparison!

5820 2018-12-05 16:03:53 I need some more oil from Samira. My hair is growing like a weed.
5821 2018-12-05 16:03:52 That's the problem with some zealots.

They want to fight for God who is all powerful &can decree anything on humans.

While it is insensitive to use books of religious adherents for just anything,it's reprehensible to have adherents who believe in God cursing & threatening...

5826 2018-12-05 16:03:45 It's a shitty book, you know, right??
5827 2018-12-05 16:03:43 Demand for more transportation continues to increase while oil reserves and production are finite. When the world hits peak oil and demand continues to grow, the price will go up as the supply continues to shrink, making other options more financially attractive.
5828 2018-12-05 16:03:36 Everything in a solar system depends upon oil to be produced. That includes production of a wide range of products that are mined from the earth such as oil, copper, iron, aluminum, silver, gold, silicon dioxide. Fortunately it's being done responsibly with better mitigation.
5829 2018-12-05 16:03:34 Lol no, you don't get to invade another country for their resources. You were right about switching to electric, though. But it would permanently replace oil.
5830 2018-12-05 16:03:31 We fussing over the 2M party, yes it bad... BUT 5.2 billion in missing oil is 2,600,000,000x worse. I care nil which government was in power for that, the loss of over 115k bbls is totally unacceptable. People need to guh jail fi that. That is isn’t theft, that is treason
5831 2018-12-05 16:03:28 Y’all..I’m getting my oil changed and this chick come in and told dude that her last oil change was in MARCHy’all really just be out here driving the car and nothing else
5832 2018-12-05 16:03:23 Bernie the reason we dont care about Yemen is because we are owned by Saudi Arabia and Yemens oil is already under control. so let them eat cake
5833 2018-12-05 16:03:22 no positions in oil --missed the down move unfortunately-----but you would have to be from another planet if you do not think there will some kind of deal to decrease production

5838 2018-12-05 16:03:03 Don't u care for climat change, the nature needs higher oil price ever, me too by the way as an algerian citizen which my country's source of entry is only from oil, so...

5842 2018-12-05 16:02:47 I have done it many times.
5843 2018-12-05 16:02:47 5.2 billion in missing oil, lol this country
5844 2018-12-05 16:02:46 good point...lol
5845 2018-12-05 16:02:38 The reality is that there is only so much oil in the earth. That's will run out in our lifetimes or at least get to the point where it's too expensive to burn in cars. All transportation will go electric because we have to.
5846 2018-12-05 16:02:34 Yeah, "hopefully."  Of course, lower oil prices will put an end to a lot of destructive shale-oil production in the US.  That's what you wanted, right?  I remember that from your campaign.  We know what the world doesn't need, by the way...

5859 2018-12-05 16:02:10 Problem with that sentiment is that it implies Alberta's the only beneficiary of an O&G economy.  We just happen to be the province of energy supply, just as Sask is the wheat province.  Canada was fine with that until oil got "dirty".  Now it's Alberta's problem.
5860 2018-12-05 16:02:07 By ~9:30 he had tweeted seven times as the ceremony was beginning he was tweeting about OPEC and oil prices
5861 2018-12-05 16:02:04 Great initiative from @Veidekke_ASA on the electric excavator!

Now we need to move the discussion toward “zero emission” rather than “fossil free”, to promote a technology shift rather than just a shift from diesel to biodiesel based on palm oil.

5863 2018-12-05 16:01:53 This is due to lack of ethics and not proper SOP.

I don't even re-use oil, once it is heated.
5864 2018-12-05 16:01:41 With this report I expect so see fuel price below 100 dollars by next month @AndrewHolnessJM . And the 600000 missing barrels oil, need to be traced and paid for by the responsible persons...
5865 2018-12-05 16:01:40 I agree but we take our price and I never regret. Pleased I got rid of my PHE though...did ok there. Thing is things could turn quickly with lots I own. Happy to be in the ones I believe in...
BTW was that you on LSE Markshares??
5866 2018-12-05 16:01:38 Surely 'mint flavouring' is the same mint oils they put in mint imperials (Cause they're basically sugar with mint oil)

5867 2018-12-05 16:01:37 We don’t get most of our oil from them, it really doesn’t matter

5869 2018-12-05 16:01:31 600,000 barrels  of oil...shocking, but the issue  is who profits from this? So will this lead to the bad gas report, or we just gonna chat without doing the necessary critical thinking? 
Who can process/ convert the fuel?
Or unuh know it's above unuh pay grade...carry  tf on.

5876 2018-12-05 16:01:10 The world does actually need higher oil prices. What else is going to drive climate action? Not your pathetic "leadership." That's for certain.

5877 2018-12-05 16:01:06 Why are you lying? You've been told before Scotland doesn't get only 8% of the oil revenue it gets around 96% and, even with that, it still has a £13bn deficit ya clown!
5878 2018-12-05 16:01:05 Turbines are beautiful and the look of today. But you obviously love the look of oil pumps and smog. Have a nice day.
5879 2018-12-05 16:01:03 Oil prices have already risen slightly which means gas prices r going to go up
5880 2018-12-05 16:00:43 Yes. Same thing with conventional vs synthetic motor oil. Much more Miracle Whip in cars than one would think

5889 2018-12-05 16:00:21 THAT is the project that is really in the national interest. The Trans Mountain completion is only the consolation prize. We should be selling our oil at home, displacing foreign supply.

5897 2018-12-05 16:00:03 The United States doesn’t need Saudi Arabia’s oil. It’s not 1962.
5898 2018-12-05 15:59:55 We just don’t need oil. We should be moving away from it. By moving towards renewable sources of power, we would open an up new and high paying jobs in areas such: Research and development, installation and programming.
5899 2018-12-05 15:59:43 Really ok answers please,dont run away.
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?

I predict you will try your best to not answer as all unionists do before they run away toblock
5900 2018-12-05 15:59:42 Or why we have oil wars which are destroying civilisation and democracy Forget about the planet ! 

Capitalism stinks and Neo Liberalism is what you get when capitalists get scared and fart
5901 2018-12-05 15:59:35 Your googles, facebooks, microsofts etc., Monopolies who require massive data pumped through their systems for their data driven business model to keep running. Content regurgitation and activity between users is also what generates this oil. Article 13 will definitely impact it.
5902 2018-12-05 15:59:27 Tell that to to the jaunes-gilets who are currently setting Paris ablaze over a rise in the price of diesel oil...
5903 2018-12-05 15:59:24 The WORLD needs to keep oil in the ground and massively start investing in and producing #RenewableEnergy

5904 2018-12-05 15:59:16 Raise the prices on oil, force manufacturers to invest in green and renewable energy. Prices might spike in the beginning but as technology advances and the initial shock is over, people will be driving better cars that help the environment.

5908 2018-12-05 15:59:01 OPEC will do what is good for them.  We should lessen our dependence on foreign oil and support environmentally sound technologies.
5909 2018-12-05 15:58:56 Hopelessly OPEC back room be onan's olympics oil flows as is, not unrestricted. The Love Nuts does not penis to see, or member, higher oil prices!
5910 2018-12-05 15:58:49 Nothing like waiting at Baxter for routine oil change.  It just doesnt get any better 
5911 2018-12-05 15:58:46 But the economy of those countries needs higher oil prices
5912 2018-12-05 15:58:42 Canada needs higher oil prices.

5917 2018-12-05 15:58:12 Thanks for getting in touch! We can confirm this is still the case, the Palm Oil used in our recipes is certified sustainable. 
5918 2018-12-05 15:58:11 Was being at a funeral that made you think of a murdered journalist, and think of the Saudi's, which in turn made you Tweet about oil prices?
Class act.
5919 2018-12-05 15:58:08 So you admit that you lied about keeping gas prices low, all by yourself, & your line in the tariff sand stops with oil prices?
5920 2018-12-05 15:58:05 Oil companies are among the biggest investors in renewable energy research.

You. Utter. Plank.
5921 2018-12-05 15:58:03 It’s clear by now you don’t understand economics and government. But do you understand words? It’s not minimum prices people oppose, it’s their setting by Congress. Does Congress set minimum prices of oil? Electricity? Computers? Trucks?
5922 2018-12-05 15:58:02 Hopefully? Were you not in cahoots with the killer Saudi prince to keep oil prices low, get Saudi money for your hotels, while keeping the narrative of “maybe he did or maybe he didn’t?

5925 2018-12-05 15:57:49 @stranahan Might it be that the fixation on Oil & the greedy lust for the maintenance of wealth & power by #Cabal has been intensified due to the imminent exposure to technologies that would make fossil fuels almost redundant?
5926 2018-12-05 15:57:45 Thought you were you going to pay your respects to a true gentleman and a great President instead of tweeting about oil. Have some decency for God's sake

5928 2018-12-05 15:57:30 On the missing barrels of oil. Here is the crux of it. What are the hidden costs besides the $5bn? Could that money have gone to prevent losses in another area? Could it have incurred additional spending in other areas? How much extra oil was ordered because of this?

5933 2018-12-05 15:57:11 Pssss.....your largest supplier, Alberta Canada, has just cut oil production to raise the crude oil price....we aren’t part of OPEC
5934 2018-12-05 15:57:10 So Low IQ - if POTUS wanted free flow, he should have stayed in the Iran deal.  Trump had better be far better to Canada that in the past.  They are the ones with flowing oil.  TOTAL BUNGLING OF OIL BY THE TRUMP ADMIN. #epicFail #DonaldAlzheimerman #DrainTheSwampofTrump
5935 2018-12-05 15:57:09 The US is the world's leading oil producer, but @TheDemocrats want to take that away from us.

5937 2018-12-05 15:56:57 Translation: “I don’t want to see, or need, higher oil prices because then my administration might lose all support.” #DumptheTrump #ItsMuellerTime #SAD
5938 2018-12-05 15:56:56 Since we get most of our oil from Canada, it should not be a problem!

5940 2018-12-05 15:56:55 Obama spent more time regulating oil to the max. All bull crap from former liar in chief. Oil was the highest price while dingle berry was in charge.

5948 2018-12-05 15:56:12 blitz up onion, garlic, spices and molasses with a little oil, slather this over the birds and marinate for a few hours.
Place birds on veg on a roasting tray, roast for around an hour.
Tip the lot, veg as well into a large soup pot, cover with water and bring to a gentle simmer
5949 2018-12-05 15:56:06 Oil needs to be at $80 for US economy to flourish. Keep US oil workers employed. No profit for US producers under 80.
5950 2018-12-05 15:55:48 Burning the midnight oil! Working 2 jobs while going to school and dancing or seeing live music most nights. While fashionably punk of course.
5951 2018-12-05 15:55:45 OPEC lost its real bite with the establishment of the US Oil Reserve but their ability to influence supply can still move prices to a limited amount.
5952 2018-12-05 15:55:40 we have to be patient for the scoping Mark.
5953 2018-12-05 15:55:34 There has been constant focus on clean energy but until a total solution of alternative energy is found it's useful to use our natural resources. Oil

5958 2018-12-05 15:55:05 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
5959 2018-12-05 15:55:03 Really! Oil prices! We’re mourning the loss of President George H. W. Bush
5960 2018-12-05 15:55:01 took my  Mazda in for an oil change, my car was not in working order when it was returned to me/ died on the way home. The dealership found metal shavings in the oil/ computer codes deleted and they're suggesting a new engine. Your DM/Owner will not return my calls! @bigotires
5961 2018-12-05 15:55:00 That didn't happen at the one I attended. The one I attended had an "oil can" but it looked A LOT like one of those cardboard coffee to-go containers that you get for catering - holds a lot of coffee and has a big spout. It was pretty ridiculous but... par for the course.
5962 2018-12-05 15:54:57 Just copped a oil change for 22 dollars.

5966 2018-12-05 15:54:40 You know most of our oil comes from Canada. Only approx 11% comes from Saudi Arabia. Just sayin.

5968 2018-12-05 15:54:37 More BMO on #BOC: we’ll need to see solid data and oil prices at a minimum hanging in there for Jan hike.; it puts the odds of Jan hike at 50/50 at best right now. "Don’t forget we’ll hear from Gov #Poloz tomorrow, and we’ll see if the appropriate message was received"
5969 2018-12-05 15:54:36 You overestimate.
two questions to test yer politics Steven
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil or the 8% we get now?

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?

If yer politics are strong you will be able to answer truthfully Steven.
5970 2018-12-05 15:54:32 That's right, Trump World doesn't want to see higher oil prices.
I've heard of blood diamonds. Is Saudi oil, blood oil?
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't ....

If we could encapsulate the exhaust fumes of burning oil products, we can virtually remove the entire human carbon dioxide chain into nature.
It can also be locked in ground

5981 2018-12-05 15:54:08 Indeed Larry! 

It is in USA  interest to make oil more expensive so that :

1. We force  progress towards more renewable energy
2. We decrease our dependencies on Saudi Arabia  
3. We decrease greenhouse gas emissions!

We need higher gas prices!
5982 2018-12-05 15:54:07 Trump - OPEC does not exist to make sure oil prices stay low. You only make the statement to bolster your suppprt of MBS.
5983 2018-12-05 15:54:04 She made millions from insurance companies...invested in big pharama/big tobacco/big oil. I tweeted to her FREQUENTLY: When you were living off the insurance companies, what did you to to lobby for free healthcare & did you EVER do pro bono medical work? SILENCE!:
5984 2018-12-05 15:54:03 We should thank Venezuela for all the cheap oil in recent years, kept low by SA and USA to break the bank in VZ.

5989 2018-12-05 15:53:33 the articles says entry level and labour while discussing immigration. People at that wage level can rarely afford to relocate unfortunately; and the oil workers are very well paid

5992 2018-12-05 15:53:15 The difference between marinara sauce and a "Gravy" is the sheer amount of meat involved. Good gravy starts with a simple marinara base; canned tomatoes flavored with onions, garlic, olive oil, herbs, red wine and a little sugar.
5993 2018-12-05 15:53:12 Hopefully I’m off for that! Well then again with oil the way it is? If I’m lucky enough to be working. I’ll have to work! But I’ve fluorescent yellow ribbons all over my FR coveralls!SOLIDARNOSC

3. Edicational institutions collect money from peasants
4. F&B cos Coca Cola sell  to peasants
5999 2018-12-05 15:53:00 Lol , so because climate FEARS are real,   blame it on the oil sands. That sounds logical. What about all the oil and  coal burning plants around the world. Shut them all down too. Do wind and solar, only they are made with oil. So now what do we do???

6031 2018-12-05 15:51:00 Why not keep oil prices low and continue to work on alternative means of energy.
6032 2018-12-05 15:50:59 I still have 3 finals & 4 papers, I’m 150 miles overdue for an oil change, need my eyebrows done desperately, my edges are practically gone, and I’ve only had 4 hrs of sleep.

Send prayers. Help. Wine. ANYTHING
6033 2018-12-05 15:50:56 LMFAOOOOOO okay I'm gagging at what you were originally insinuating BUT someone said it's the most expensive one so how him fi a HYPOTHETICALLY get free(?) oil and a charge suh much fi it 
6034 2018-12-05 15:50:52 Oil is important.  Shouldn’t you capitalize it?
6035 2018-12-05 15:50:50 This oil's got blood in it...
6036 2018-12-05 15:50:46 You can smell teargas in the streets as oil industry squabbles - Asia Times
6037 2018-12-05 15:50:36 There were reliable reports that while you were having fun during G20 in Argentina, some of your bffs were meeting to discuss decreasing oil production. That will lead to what? Yes, oil price hike. #basta
6038 2018-12-05 15:50:36 Alaska is an oil economy, we get hurt with low oil prices.
6039 2018-12-05 15:50:34 Higher oil prices reduce use of oil and encourage development of natural gas and alternative fuel sources, reducing the release of CO2, thereby helping reduce global warming and need to dike Mar-a-Lago and Turnberry, among other, less important properties - like our naval bases.
6040 2018-12-05 15:50:33 Indeed!  

Let’s make oil more expensive so that :

1. We force  progress towards more renewable energy
2. We decrease our dependencies on Saudi Arabia  
3. We decrease greenhouse gas emissions!

We need higher gas prices! 
6041 2018-12-05 15:50:32 Well your answer is pretty patronizing but actually the fact that she takes millions from oil and gas and pharmaceutical and tobacco and alcohol lobbies IS an issue with me and many others ...
6042 2018-12-05 15:50:31 CBD oil is like decaf THC.
6043 2018-12-05 15:50:30 But those aren't children....they're just parasitic clumps of cells that could not survive outside the host body.
6044 2018-12-05 15:50:24 It doesn’t do anything. You’ll be better off using Jamaican black castor oil or even kaleidoscope oil
6045 2018-12-05 15:50:21 the chinese sesame oil is smokey (and pungent). that's not what you use for mutton no. desi til ka tel works beautifully.
6046 2018-12-05 15:50:20 He was using his oil company as a cover to hide his CIA connections. His oil buddy-friend's son was the one who shot Ronald Reagan only 2 months+10 days after Reagan took office. Wow, what a coincidence, eh?
6047 2018-12-05 15:50:19 You mean one of the UK’s most prominent Tory Party donors, who will pay more tax on the vast profits he makes from oil, gas, healthcare and other services in Scotland in the event of independence, and who is desperate to get fracking started in Perth & Kinross?
6048 2018-12-05 15:50:15 You children will be suffering from cancer because your father pushes burning oil and coal. They will suffer under the climate change and they can’t take your billions with them at an early stage.
6049 2018-12-05 15:50:11 The world needs less use of oil.
6050 2018-12-05 15:50:09 I guess PM Trudeau is not smart enough to get Canada world oil prices for our oil.  He cannot even get a pipeline finished IN CANADA!
6051 2018-12-05 15:50:09 WE NEED TO STOP OIL finding stupid  SOLAR CARS SOLAR AIRPLANES DONALD IS A DIVA 45
6052 2018-12-05 15:50:02 What happened? Did US Oil producing industry not offer enough support/ accolades/money to help you keep drilling costs here competitive with OPEC?
6053 2018-12-05 15:49:36 We got more than enough oil in the ground. We need to work on self-sufficiency, Mr. President.
6054 2018-12-05 15:49:30 The visit to Yemen Arab Republic by VP George HW Bush was symbolically for buisness with US oil companies . But the fundamental reason was to ( blunt Soviet Influence and to solidify relations with this isolated tip of the Arabian Peninsula)

6055 2018-12-05 15:49:29 I've only seen Ian Wood representing Oil and Fishing, when will he be doing Whisky and Farming?
6056 2018-12-05 15:49:28 My cousin called to tell me black seed oil makes you fertile .... my nigga I’m not having no kids right now but thanks for the heads up 
6057 2018-12-05 15:49:24 Malaysia and Indonesia are destroying their ecosystem for Palm oil.
6058 2018-12-05 15:49:17 Already having a morning and notice the smiley face my fiance made on my sticker when he changed my oil yesterday.

＼It's OIL!!!／
6060 2018-12-05 15:49:07 I don’t care about the news for another thing like trade, oil, cars, or tariffs, etc. all I want to look at news or read twitter or Facebook or newsletter saying the FBI and CIA is dissolved
6061 2018-12-05 15:49:02 If I buy anything with my money, I can do whatever I like with it. You have no say in whatever I do with it, be it a Qur'an, a bible or a Vedas.
6062 2018-12-05 15:48:56 Well am not responsible for your lack of comprehension.
6063 2018-12-05 15:48:54 Boy you people are something else. You want cheap oil but you don't want it to cheap. Listen I hope it falls to $30 a barrel. You people bitch and piss and moan too much.
6064 2018-12-05 15:48:52 Fake. oil production went up under Obama
6065 2018-12-05 15:48:43 $CAD really impressed with surprise oil drop
6066 2018-12-05 15:48:41 it seems that Kenya strongly believes in western  imperialists than themselves, be careful, some of the so-called investors are actually more dangerous than they look=ask Nigerians and the oil curse, western backed boko haram, Niger delta environmental disaster.........
6067 2018-12-05 15:48:40 Honestly.......I’m all about this. The garlic infused olive oil looks good
6068 2018-12-05 15:48:40 Can you put your money where your mouth is Mr. SOS (snake oil salesman) and give 90 pct of your money to the govt. so they can give it to the poor migrants? Else shut up !
6069 2018-12-05 15:48:37 Depends how much of this is tied to a domestic extraction industry that will collapse if oil consumption, and price, drop.
6070 2018-12-05 15:48:31 It kinda does need higher oil prices to help shift demand from non-renewable energy sources, but you don’t care about that so nvmd.
6071 2018-12-05 15:48:15 What rubbish? The Qur'an? I don't understand

What will you do if I do whatever I want with the Qur'an I bought with my money?
6072 2018-12-05 15:48:13 HOW LONG Will YOU MOURN FOR PDP ?
And the Lord said unto Samuel , how long will you mourn for Saul , seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel ? Fill your horn with oil and go, I will send you to house of JESSE the Bethlehemite : for I have provided my self a king
6073 2018-12-05 15:48:06 You probably don’t know this but oil is a limited resource. Keep polluting the planet and we’ll all be walking around wear masks. #NotSmart
6074 2018-12-05 15:48:02 oil pastel=not a good idea
6075 2018-12-05 15:48:01 Try tea tree oil!
6076 2018-12-05 15:48:00 3. Sleep 7+ hrs/night - 10p-5/6a is my routine - Sleep is my fav performance enhancing drug 
4. Daily multi-vitamin, +2-4K MG of Vitamin D3 recommended by doctors for keeping mood positive and preventing many diseases, also Fish Oil if you start working out for joint health.
6077 2018-12-05 15:47:58 And THAT is why you hobble Alberta oil, low pump prices may you look good while raping Canada of $6Billion. How'd you like to get just 10 bucks a barrel for 50 dollar oil? Not so funny is it?
6078 2018-12-05 15:47:58 Why not switch to renewable sources of energy? Then we won't be concerned with the price of oil.
6079 2018-12-05 15:47:48 I'm really tired of seeing posts about diffusing tee tree oil or something and making their pets sick
1. Why are you diffusing tea tree u fuckin weirdo that shits for topical use
2. It's a quick 10 second google search to see if an oil is safe for your pet don't be an idiot
6080 2018-12-05 15:47:46 "Needs to be addressed"...man is that an understatement. AB /SASK cannot be giving away oil at $14/barrel much longer. Utter disregard by PM & MPs.
6081 2018-12-05 15:47:44 My friend just received the little oil painting of a Robin I did for her. It made her cry, I like making people cry. 
6082 2018-12-05 15:47:40 Things in union were cool untill the oil came along then westminster went into England first mode as it always does.
The oil showed the union up for what it is,scots resources propping up UK and for allowing that scots get ignored and direspected.
Grow a pair!
6083 2018-12-05 15:47:40 Sht I need  Nd oil money if we takin my whip  fytb
6084 2018-12-05 15:47:40 Funny how a tweet from Trump makes more impact in the oil market than an OPEC meeting. They really need to speak up if still relevant... The trump tweets, the more cuts are needed
6085 2018-12-05 15:47:37 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the World....There was talk of military action by our country to end the uprise in that country....Hmmmmm go figure...
6086 2018-12-05 15:47:37 Bill. I said before. I work in oil. I wasn't lying. Do you, honestly think that it was "ignored and sidelined during brexit" (again brexit that almost 40pc of Scots vote for)
6087 2018-12-05 15:47:31 It’s all good that black castor oil bout to get me right 
6088 2018-12-05 15:47:29 I like the donut thingies! Hanukkah has a lot of foods cooked in oil to celebrate with. It's amaaaazing. 
6089 2018-12-05 15:47:24 Sounds like trying to justify your position with Saudi Crown Prince. We get a high % of oil from Canada. Unconscionable your dismissal of Khashoggi’s murder.
6090 2018-12-05 15:47:23 Does this happen to be a place where people can oil wrestle?
6091 2018-12-05 15:47:22 たとえるなら、これが最初で最後でいいくらい いろんなとこ出しきりました。妥協はしていないです。会場でしか味わえないかなと！ たのみます！！
6092 2018-12-05 15:47:19 The world does not need oil and the sooner we can get off fossil fuels the better it will be for human beings, animals, and the earth.
6093 2018-12-05 15:47:19 I've never had a subie head gasket issue. Oil starvation, sure, but no HG.
6094 2018-12-05 15:47:17 OPEC’s gathering in Vienna comes at a tricky time for the oil industry and consumers who depend on the world’s largest source of energy.
6095 2018-12-05 15:47:16 The world doesn't want to see any more oil flow at all! #ClimateChangeIsReal #RenewableEnergy NOW!
Then your oil prices will go down.
6096 2018-12-05 15:47:11 That looks quite something for you. I would love to visit Australia. The closest I have ever got was watching Neighbours. Have you ever watched it ? Really good and they say things like 'chuck' instead of chicken and they are really happy people.
That is how I imagine Australians
6097 2018-12-05 15:47:11 無銭でリトルモア見たかったし、ジュリ祟のワンマン行きたかったし、ゾンパの定期公演行きたかったし、体が足りなすぎる。忘れられてそう
6098 2018-12-05 15:47:11 an oil change and tire alignment is really a game changer 
6099 2018-12-05 15:47:10 My staining was literally the most temporary staining I’ve ever seen. I used an oil based cleanser and a makeup wipe and it came off pretty quickly. I’m sure it will be the same with James’ palette too.
6100 2018-12-05 15:47:09 Too much oil in your hair....
6101 2018-12-05 15:47:02 Well you can try rubbish and see the consequence yourself.
 لايمسه الا المطهرون it is not touched except by the pure (a Muslim) .
We don't joke around with the holy book.
6102 2018-12-05 15:46:58 Rick Simpson oil
6103 2018-12-05 15:46:55 And have BETTER LUCK getting their OIL from THERE to Anywhere without the help of the US MILITARY... Tell it how it IS, not how it ISN'T!!  LIBERTARIANISM must be a mental disorder too.
6104 2018-12-05 15:46:55 Well, here’s the twist...even if it doesn’t go up, the dollar is dropping because of your BS, which means the price of oil will still go up relative to the value of the dollar even if they don’t actually raise the price per barrel!
6105 2018-12-05 15:46:53 Equity traders turning oil traders today? WTI making new intraday highs.
6106 2018-12-05 15:46:52 girl what oil shit cause i need it
6107 2018-12-05 15:46:49 And yep. Would be nice if we could get round to global warming once people start valuing the planet more than money from oil or gas
6108 2018-12-05 15:46:47 If there was ever a President that capitulated to foreign oil and energy conglomerates, while willing to undermine human rights and democracy....it was him.
He led the way for the United States to be the hypocritical oligarchy that it's become.
Him and Cheney were atrocious.
6109 2018-12-05 15:46:44 As soon as renewable energy sources, or solar power or wind power can lift and fly a 787 jet...then and only then can we begin the talk of the reduction in the use of oil. Until such time...oil is king! And it's a complete fantasy and lie of the Left to say otherwise.
6110 2018-12-05 15:46:42 Yeah that’s how I used to be. I recommend it to anyone who experiences chronic headaches/migraines. The CBD oil helped but it didn’t take them away.
6111 2018-12-05 15:46:40 Have you ever heard of solar power and wind Mills. Much cheaper and it we don't have to rely on a government killing a journalist and accepting their oil, are you get to build something there so you stay quiet
6112 2018-12-05 15:46:39 Estoy en un evento de los trabajadores de finanzas de la industria de oil&gas colombiana. Y hay unos daddies muy pero muy rerikis y con esos sueldos que tienen podría casarme con uno de ellos, que me mantenga, dedicarme a la filantropía y a jugar cartas toda la vida.
6113 2018-12-05 15:46:38 Donald, on a serious note. The world does want higher oil prices,  Higher prices make fuel inefficient cars obselete, it forces people to go green and it reduces the CO2 emissions and makes the air cleaner. Also makes countries with oil richer..like Canada. Yippee for us.
6114 2018-12-05 15:46:32 With the Petrojam issue my biggest question is, where does BILLIONS of dollars of oil disappear to?
6115 2018-12-05 15:46:32 are you worried at all about the apparent negative correlation with oil? can they go up togeter? thank you
6116 2018-12-05 15:46:30 CBD oil is like decaf THC.
6117 2018-12-05 15:46:30 Oil back above $54 a barrel even though OPEC cuts uncertain.
6118 2018-12-05 15:46:27 Nuclear power is the only energy source that can break out dependence on oil.  It has the highest power concentration, with the smallest footprint.  It is safer than wind and solar.  And it has zero emissions.
6119 2018-12-05 15:46:26 I'll give my son body lotion, shampoo 4 his hair, coconut oil 4 his beards, foot cream, things to keep his body clean & moisturized. All this ashy feet & unkempt boys I see going abt like it's no man's bz. Not my son!
6120 2018-12-05 15:46:20 If it's because of oil prices, then no point in blaming or praising the govt ... Govt neither did great to control the prising nor can take credits for lowering price
6121 2018-12-05 15:46:20 You mean to say it was not done by Obama Administration? Mr Sanders stop talking like a snake oil salesman. I am an immigrant and I realize the harm you are doing to this country by teaching rights without teaching reaponsibilities.
6122 2018-12-05 15:46:20 Can the country actually buy oil and keep reserves at this lowered price so that citizens are not 100% exposed to the markets movements?? 
It would really be appreciated. 
Thanks.
6123 2018-12-05 15:46:18 Where there’s oil there’s life .
6124 2018-12-05 15:46:14 Hi @trevortombe not sure of this is your bag, but do you have any graphs showing what AB oil gets processed into?
Jet fuel, auto fuel, plastics, whatever else.
Just curious what the final product is, % wise.
6125 2018-12-05 15:46:09 Check your Transmission oil today.
6126 2018-12-05 15:46:05 With your dumb policy there is no oil left within a few years!
6127 2018-12-05 15:46:01 It’s a face cream! It’s a dessert topping! It’s crude oil!
6128 2018-12-05 15:45:59 Bird in my Gas course gave me THC oil and now I’m tryna figure out how I’m going to get home in 20 minuyes! Am fucked 
6129 2018-12-05 15:45:58 Lol, which oil company will employ me like this ? When my pops is not a governor or senator?

6131 2018-12-05 15:45:50 Canadian dollar tumbles to 6-month low after Bank of Canada sees oil price drop hurting energy sector
6132 2018-12-05 15:45:50 It is about time you pay the right price for our oil from Canada and otherwise f#%k off with your great advice!
6133 2018-12-05 15:45:50 To be fair, the oil industry does. $100 plus

6135 2018-12-05 15:45:49 you talk as if mustard oil isn't fragrant
6136 2018-12-05 15:45:39 I think the world absolutely NEEDS higher oil prices, many of us want to see that, realizing it’s whats best for the WORLD. What happened to maga -are you now trying to MAKE THE WORLD GREAT AGAIN?
6137 2018-12-05 15:45:39 Who charges such ludicrous prices ~ do they think people are so dumb & don't know how much it actually costs to buy oil illegally? It's a p*** take & nothing more than exploitation & GREED 
People before profit  #UK
6138 2018-12-05 15:45:31 dude, I recommended the sunflower oil one. great minds
6139 2018-12-05 15:45:28 US oil boom is do to fracking , so if oil is too cheap it will lower our production. If it stays moderate then we will see profits increase while having lower prices at the pump.
6140 2018-12-05 15:45:27 Whom among us doesn't store olive oil on their end table
6141 2018-12-05 15:45:25 WTI has been rising ever since the tweet. DJT no longer has any way of controlling oil prices. His last tweet had no effect on prices as well. Manipulator In Chief has no right to bash OPEC for controlling prices when he's trying to do the same thing.
6142 2018-12-05 15:45:25 Oil prices are tied to true market pressures (supply and demand) with comparatively little excess inventory maintained. OPEC accounts for roughly 40% of the world’s oil production. If OPEC cut production US companies wouldn’t be able to increase production fast enough to offset
6143 2018-12-05 15:45:22 The people who died in his oil war against Iraq aren't better off...
6144 2018-12-05 15:45:22 What’s a little murder especially of a journalist if oil is low.   Why aren’t we issuing our own reserves and researching alternative energy? That would be futuristic.
6145 2018-12-05 15:45:21 5555 หนูจะให้น้องเข้าไปคนเดียว หนูจะรอมันหน้างานเอา
6146 2018-12-05 15:45:17 Propping up the dollar with the secret Saudi oil handshake?
6147 2018-12-05 15:45:14 There is a lot of oil available, outside OPEC, (who will try to keep prices optimal to serve their interests). If prices go up, more oil will come online at specific price-points, including the huge oil-sands & shales which have higher break-even  prices. Again, supply & demand!

6150 2018-12-05 15:44:58 Started a castor oil routine myself this week 
6151 2018-12-05 15:44:55 What to know how you turn Texas blue in 2020? Keep cheering for low oil prices.  It wont just be the people in the liberal counties in Texas that are pissed off at you.  It will be all those folks in rural areas too.
6152 2018-12-05 15:44:50 en route to the final destination, which was always to get trashed, wasted, hammered, crunked up, bombed, wrecked, sloshed, fried, flapjacked, fucked-up, or get plainlong fucked, laid, drained, get some ass, get some head, some skull, a lube job, get your oil changed...
6153 2018-12-05 15:44:49 It's because the global demand and worth of the Dollar is linked to Saudi oil sells, hence the name Petro-Dollar. The US can't just simply switch the main way of producing energy without risking it's economy to take damage. It's not that easy
6154 2018-12-05 15:44:49 Sound like you begging  on your knees to withstand the higher prices on oil in your country.
6155 2018-12-05 15:44:37 What about OUR oil donnie dog nuts? Why isnt the great country of ours getting gas for pennies like other countries that produce tons of oil? I know why...its all a fucking game...and of course we pay!
6156 2018-12-05 15:44:36 Are you kidding?
How can you think that when westmiinster hid scots oil then lied about the amount,then voted to take 92% of it,then ignored and sidelined during brexit,,,do you seriously think this is ok?
Would England take that from a union partner?
6157 2018-12-05 15:44:33 @Ford Just for ur information, choose Ford Endeav over Toyota.  Car has Engine Oil leak  problems with 145km.The Customer Service is freaking disgusting as for Ford India the less I speak better it sounds. As a Customer it can’t get worse or is this the Ford Culture. Regrets
6158 2018-12-05 15:44:33 I FORGOT TO TELL NIGGAS IM BACK IN THE CITY FROM THE BULL. I GOTTA OIL CHANGE APPT @ 1:30, LINK UP AFTER THAT?
6159 2018-12-05 15:44:32 Than fix it so we don’t have hire oil prices .
6160 2018-12-05 15:44:27 Did you ever, or do you still, change your own oil? Do you find it fun, or satisfying?

6162 2018-12-05 15:44:26 OPEC’s gathering in Vienna comes at a tricky time for the oil industry and consumers who depend on the world’s largest source of energy.
6163 2018-12-05 15:44:21 จริงงง แต่ก็นะผู้ใหญ่ก็จะมองว่าไม่มั่นคง ไม่มีสวัสดิการ
6164 2018-12-05 15:44:15 Aika buy think of it why would applying oil on your breast make them perky? Kana ndiwewo?
6165 2018-12-05 15:44:15 Happy birthday bro i still be laughing when I think about that party in Dallas. Niggas say “you know what you gotta do for that oil” Ol girl start twerking immediately 
6166 2018-12-05 15:44:12 So, are you saying; slaughter innocent journalists to keep oil prices low? And now, you’re ending subsidies on high efficiency cars.
6167 2018-12-05 15:44:10 This is what generally happens when a government decides to phase out, and in the meantime sabotage a countries most important export product: Oil.

Recycled transfer payments might give the illusion of GDP, but it's not real economic activity, it's just shuffling money around.

6169 2018-12-05 15:44:00 It’s not there Michelle because Trudeau doesn’t care. He says all the right word but actions speak louder than words. He and Gerald want to close the oil sands!
6170 2018-12-05 15:43:59 There is no glut of Canadian oil - issue is inability to transport & sell oil at a world competitive price. Canadian oil is stuck with one customer (the US) who is already the largest oil producer in the world. Fiddling with interest rates (up/down) does nothing to solve this.
6171 2018-12-05 15:43:56 Thank you Mr President 39 to 59 per barrel is a good range for oil , allowing even POOR nations the ability to develop

WAIT The LEFT hate poor people , lets go back to 100 per and let the POOR have lights only when the wind blows
6172 2018-12-05 15:43:55 Shut up Donnie. You're out of your element! RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
6173 2018-12-05 15:43:53 when a Republican is conspicuously silent on Trump atrocities, opposes the ban on concealed weapons @ schools & votes w/ big oil loses in a +12 dem district it's bcuz she was out of step w/ the voters in the district, NOT becuz of partisan smears. #checktherecord

6175 2018-12-05 15:43:50 USA should not be dependent on OPEC. We have as much if not more oil than Saudi Arabia. Loser liberals crying about "polar bears & ice caps melting" etc is BS. If USA was energy independent, many things including gas prices would be cheaper.
6176 2018-12-05 15:43:49 ..Weakness in oil allows for non-inflationary growth. Regional housing markets appear to have stabilized and non energy related business investment is expected to strengthen. The Loonie has fallen to session lows and $USDCAD has now pushed to YTD highs at 1.3400 #cdnecon
6177 2018-12-05 15:43:48 WASPS gave us Iraq war, overthrow of Hussein, 1 million displaced Iraqis, raiding Iraq and dividing up its oil reserves between multinational oil conglomerates. Nope I don't miss WASPS.
6178 2018-12-05 15:43:29 OPEC’s gathering in Vienna comes at a tricky time for the oil industry and consumers who depend on the world’s largest source of energy.
6179 2018-12-05 15:43:27 Thinking of killing already. Too bad!
6180 2018-12-05 15:43:24 He called the Oil. n Gas industry a “crisis” last week while in Calgary.  Yet nothing is being done and the pipeline isn’t being built as ppl are starving and behind on bills.  But TruDUMB gives Millions away to other countries.
6181 2018-12-05 15:43:22 What the world needs is for you to get your shit together and be a man, be presidential, there’s more to life than oil flow, there’s humanity, decency, humility, honour, dignity, non of which you possess, you can’t allow a barbaric killing of a journalist to go unpunished
6182 2018-12-05 15:43:12 also something one does when one seeks to persuade to bring to ones side by emotions, not because of the persuasiveness of argument or intellect. Also brings more kids on side. Sad how kids are being used by today's "progressives"

6187 2018-12-05 15:42:56 Without fail left a mess for me to clear. There are pools of oil in the toaster. No way another person can use the toaster without smoking up the whole kitchen. Toast for breakfast is impossible. Because the toast will taste of chicken oil.
6188 2018-12-05 15:42:56 The BoC's policy statement is the least hawkish they could have released. Weakness in oil & ongoing trade conflicts highlighted as a couple of the areas providing headwinds.

6189 2018-12-05 15:42:41 Not too worried about the 1st round guys, which I include Benson in, it's the others that are the wild cards. Jones appears as though he could be something not sold on any of the others but we shall see.
6190 2018-12-05 15:42:36 We could reduce our dependence on blood oil...
6191 2018-12-05 15:42:29 Where did $5 billion of oil go? A little birdie told me that the first and last name begin with the same letter
6192 2018-12-05 15:42:27 Just gave myself a blast of heating with the Argos Simple Value oil filled radiator. Five layers and long johns on.
6193 2018-12-05 15:42:27 She already is ! It’s obvious she’s not wearing any oil based makeup my lord just look at a picture !
6194 2018-12-05 15:42:25 @DrSatishShah It's me Rev. Dr. Mike C. Nwachukwu. The Director of Operations Anyiam Oil Interbiz Nigeria Limited.
6195 2018-12-05 15:42:25 Let’s think of other ways than relying on oil!!  SMDH
6196 2018-12-05 15:42:24 In the understanding of the region working on the definition of the goals of the production of OPEC and the determination of the world oil production control area control decisions of excellence and influence in the output of consumption
6197 2018-12-05 15:42:17 I think its gonna come down like oil 
6198 2018-12-05 15:42:06 Bah. My bad. I get it now. I thought reserves were already extracted oil. I should know this  In which case, yeah not a great plan.
6199 2018-12-05 15:42:04 Tiba2 teringat lecturer aku tanya.

Which one have better taste. Cooking with sunflower oil or palmoil hahaha.
6200 2018-12-05 15:42:03 A dastardly plan by the oil industry? How positively Slavic of them!
6201 2018-12-05 15:42:02 Oil, for all its current abundance, is a finite resource, someday there will be No Oil.
6202 2018-12-05 15:42:01 Please don't depend on them. We have all the oil we need in our country.  Let them drill now and build more refineries. We need freedom from foreign dependence
6203 2018-12-05 15:42:00 Ladies and gentlemen, Harmattan is finally here. 
Arm yourselves with tha coconut oil and petroleum jelly. 

Shalom.
6204 2018-12-05 15:41:59 but we will always see high oil prices, OPEC is meant to maximize profits, if you really are a businessman, you would know full well that they will not cut profits to save us money
6205 2018-12-05 15:41:52 Let’s fund alternative energy sources so we don’t need the oil. Oh forgot, you don’t believe this is necessary.
6206 2018-12-05 15:41:50 Higher oil prices would drive the change to renewable energy investment which would be cheaper, cleaner and beneficial to all after investment.

Oh, but you don't believe in climate change...
6207 2018-12-05 15:41:46 Facts are the enemy of all MAGATs! They can’t handle the truth... like the fact that their #MAGAGod is a snakeskin oil salesman, con artist criminal who will go to prison when the dust settles on #TrumpRussiaConspiracyToDefraudAmerica
6208 2018-12-05 15:41:45 Ah bros,
That's the Isoko part of you speaking.
No worry we go share oil well reach you.
6209 2018-12-05 15:41:42 Hey man me and my oil industry dependent family are gonna need you to shut the hell up okay?
6210 2018-12-05 15:41:40 I work in the cannabis industry.  You can mix it all up.  We sell lots of mixture blends.  I like a high thc for a Saturday night, but like more balanced for everyday.  I do take cbd oil for all day, for aging and good health.
6211 2018-12-05 15:41:37 Your voters in TX, LA, ND, OK, PA, WY it seems DO need to see higher oil prices.
6212 2018-12-05 15:41:35 So much easier. No oil changes, fewer moving parts, etc,.
6213 2018-12-05 15:41:31 What's valued in Canada exactly? A PM who insults every construction worker across the country? A PM who is crushing the oil industry singlehandedly? Canada needs a leader not a poster boy. The current "leader" of this country is leading us right into the shitter.
6214 2018-12-05 15:41:17 Rutin ibuibu sebelum tido, makan iberet, pastu olive oil dua sudu. Ibu2 klu susah berak time preggy tu elok lah mkn olive oil. Esok membuang smooth je.  #PregnancyProblems
6215 2018-12-05 15:41:17 With all due respect Prez Trump, can you explain why in the HELL we DON'T own OUR own OIL?!?!  TABOO, Oh yeah I know, but still come on!  Where's ALL THE $ COLLECTED FROM AT LEAST 1930 TIL NOW THE GOV'T COLLECTED?
6216 2018-12-05 15:41:16 My truck is begging for an oil change.
6217 2018-12-05 15:41:11 I love how after these bang average, oil rich, buy their way into White House leaders retire we collectively act like they were a 'great man'. 
6218 2018-12-05 15:41:08 55555555 ก็คือพี่ห่วงบัตรมากกว่างาน เคลียได้ๆ สู้เต็มที่เรื่องนี้
6219 2018-12-05 15:40:58 I forgot I scheduled an oil change and tire rotation at 5pm today like an idyut.
6220 2018-12-05 15:40:58 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
6221 2018-12-05 15:40:58 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6222 2018-12-05 15:40:58 EIA has US oil production over 12m bpd next year, which I guess is the guide for this week's OPEC+ discussions. What are you referring to?
6223 2018-12-05 15:40:51 i procrastinate while programming by meticulously commenting my existing code, brushing jojoba oil around my fingernails, drinking extra water, and checking in on friends via text
6224 2018-12-05 15:40:46 If we half our consumption of fossil fuel the oil companies will half the production of oil. Without having to do one bit of “donation monitoring”. If we don’t change our consumption habits halving production just leads to rampant inflation. 2/
6225 2018-12-05 15:40:40 @Saltwatertattoo do you have a preference on a certain companies cbd oil. Been interested in trying some.
6226 2018-12-05 15:40:40 U and I Like oil and water.
6227 2018-12-05 15:40:39 Your continued support for fossil fuels is keeping us hostage to foreign oil. For national security you really should be looking at green alternatives.  I am sure Pence is telling you differently, but you must remember.....Pence wants your job.
6228 2018-12-05 15:40:39 Everything can be done in feasible way,but when production becomes more than demands will lead exploitation of resources.This is happening in plan oil industries where seller is trying to produce more than demand of consumers and outcome is,decrimination and depletion of wildlife
6229 2018-12-05 15:40:38 Lmao bro we just see fucking Yoshi doing an oil change in the background like " HA these fuckers are running on shitty oil ha"
6230 2018-12-05 15:40:33 Wow he’s so deep..what an observation...I thought the world wanted higher oil prices...what a stable genius this fuck is.
6231 2018-12-05 15:40:32 @TheRoyGreenShow Riddle me this: Oil was $90 bbl. In Alberta, gas was $1.15/L. Oil is now $10 bbl - 89% lower. Gas is $1.00 (which, in fairness includes a6c carbon tax), only 9.1% lower. How about a guest that can rationaliz this to the layperson????
6232 2018-12-05 15:40:29 People will be mad and blame you for Oil Prices being TOO LOW.
6233 2018-12-05 15:40:28 あいて…ちょっとエルザにスリーサイズ聞いただけなのに殴られた…
6234 2018-12-05 15:40:25 The world doesn't want to see or need oil.  We need clean alternative fuels.  But then, you're too dense to see that.

6239 2018-12-05 15:40:07 In all seriousness, popcorn works really well and is comparable. Obviously make sure the books are wrapped in something to protect from grease. Also, for extra sustainability, make it from kernels yourself because microwave kind all had palm oil.
6240 2018-12-05 15:40:06 We done our best to keep bombing the fuck out of them to this day. We literally destroyed the entire place and left it a total shit hole and we let a few of them take some money for the oil.Its ongoing payback for Manchester bomb.
6241 2018-12-05 15:40:02 Amen 
6242 2018-12-05 15:40:01 Palm oil, so you're fucking so much more with your choice.
6243 2018-12-05 15:39:57 Great article! I would be interested in the extension of this, a foreign policy centered around exporting the technology and be able to change the definition "American interests" (not relying on oil politics) which would allow the US to actually be a moral leader on human rights.
6244 2018-12-05 15:39:57 the best mutton curry is made with either robust mustard oil or like i did today, good quality மரச்செக்கு நல்லெண்ணை (wood pressed gingelly oil). ghee is only for the lazy lot.
6245 2018-12-05 15:39:57 Going to cost lots of jobs with low oil prices! West Texas has had the highest job growth in the usa, but low oil prices will kill it!
6246 2018-12-05 15:39:56 I have used butter, olive oil, and coconut oil.  I think my favorite is coconut oil.  I love the way it adds a bit more nutty flavor.
6247 2018-12-05 15:39:56 Here come the libs to say oil prices need to be high because Trump says they should be low!
6248 2018-12-05 15:39:52 everybody knows that when The Donald starts whining, a member of congress whispers #covfefe
6249 2018-12-05 15:39:51 Exactly. We are regulated and restricted and have cut our emissions drastically. The rest of the world still points its collective finger at us and says MOAR while China laughs.
6250 2018-12-05 15:39:50 It's because of oil prices , I hope you u know now 
6251 2018-12-05 15:39:46 So he understands price increases as supply decreases for oil, but he can't figure it out for steel
6252 2018-12-05 15:39:38 Chocolate is the perfect Valentine's gift and our chocolate is no ordinary chocolate! It tastes awesome because it is made using some of the best cocoa in the world and has 50% less sugar, 25% protein, and is gluten, lactose and palm oil free! 
6253 2018-12-05 15:39:37 Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
6254 2018-12-05 15:39:34 To my eyes, oil has just bottomed out. 

Stock & oil move together. 

For stock, allow high oil price.
6255 2018-12-05 15:39:29 I’m glad I got my oil changed last night now I can just go to the gym. Today will be a very productive day for me 
6256 2018-12-05 15:39:28 Isa 61:3 KJV   To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.
6257 2018-12-05 15:39:28 I hope they do restrict it.. the world doesn't need free flowing oil. We need more clean energy and save oil for absolutely necessary functions.  Heating house and driving autos can be done MUCH CLEANER you yellow anus.
6258 2018-12-05 15:39:24 You waited a whole ten minutes after eulogizing a man who didn't respect you to front for OPEC. That was the time between your Condolences to the Bush's tweet and your real business of oil profits.

6267 2018-12-05 15:39:00 Lol 5 billion dollars worth of oil just disappeared??? What?
6268 2018-12-05 15:38:53 ที่ผ่านมายังไม่เคยทำแบบเต็มตัวอ่ะ หยิบนู่นนี่หน่อยๆ ถ้าทำเต็มตัวคงเงินดีอยู่
6269 2018-12-05 15:38:52 Teri, do you have docs or names of players you can share regarding the natural gas and oil connection? I ask because there is definitely a Canadian connection. We are witnessing the same iron triangles in Canada, with US connections. Also connected to dominionist evangelicals
6270 2018-12-05 15:38:50 I haven't bothered with the whole fauxtatoes approach, I just like cauliflower roasted with a coating of olive oil and @officialprimo garlic pepper

Soooooo much better than the boring boiled stuff I grew up with
6271 2018-12-05 15:38:47 stop referring to yourself as "higher oil prices"
6272 2018-12-05 15:38:45 struggle is real kapag napapapikit ka na while rubbing an oil cleanser sa face mo 


6273 2018-12-05 15:38:43 Actually the US oil industry does.
6274 2018-12-05 15:38:39 We bail out GM, lose $11billion in the deal, and GM spends $1b and $450m opening up assembly plants in China & Mexico. Sure, coal and oil isn't friendly, but it keeps workers in jobs. GM screwed us. 

A lot like the ponzi scheme you & criminal brother attempted.
6275 2018-12-05 15:38:36 Fusion may not work for 500 years, if ever.
American Plan of Natural Gas + Renewables will be the primary energy model for next 75 years.

Coal is too dirty and nuclear costs 10x to 20x too much.

Although I've diced it first to roast with root vegetables before.
6278 2018-12-05 15:38:24 What we need is aggressive moves to make us less dependent on oil.
6279 2018-12-05 15:38:24 The US has taken on more to "clean the environment" than any other country, and its citizenry has paid for it. Think poorly of us all  you want, I don't give a piss
6280 2018-12-05 15:38:23 Stop teasing us with these diversions. What about the space force? Does the space force use oil? Or warp drives?
6281 2018-12-05 15:38:23 :( RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
6282 2018-12-05 15:38:22 Well apparently only billions of oil money got Man City started on the first place, because they were nowhere without it. Could just as easily have happened to Accrington Stanley.

6284 2018-12-05 15:38:13 You big oil supporters have to stop with the personal attacks when I disagree with you. Makes you look stupid when your only come back in an insult.
6285 2018-12-05 15:38:13 Apparently mom's going to boycott lush because they don't support the oil sands...where huge tracts of wilderness are being destroyed...but they don't say anything about Saudi Arabian oil, which if I remember right is harvested in a less destructive manor. 
Idiot.
6286 2018-12-05 15:38:12 Guess you are giving us a heads up oil will be going back up.
6287 2018-12-05 15:38:09 Forget OPEC, just look to Alberta, Canada - we have plenty of oil on the cheap #justsayin

6294 2018-12-05 15:37:57 As well he should. Our dependence on oil has cost us trillions in defense spending, left our economy at risk, and forced us to support dictators & shitty leaders in oil rich countries simply to keep oil cheap. Not to mention the amount of oil money that gets funneled to terrorist
6295 2018-12-05 15:37:53 So you support bombing kids to keep your oil prices down. Got it.
6296 2018-12-05 15:37:51 Opec will keep Oil flow in Trump's ass
6297 2018-12-05 15:37:48 Original 
Oil 
Otherwise
6298 2018-12-05 15:37:43 Or we could infer  l don't care that 
Khashoggi's blood flowed because MBS butchered him, we have lower oil prices.
6299 2018-12-05 15:37:41 I read the other day that we are producing the majority of our own oil now, and we’re about to become an energy exporter, not importer.  So if you’re worried about local oil / gas prices, maybe you could pass some real /America First’ legislation that helps keep pump prices down
6300 2018-12-05 15:37:37 I agree totally with Ed. Trump has no idea about renewables. More interested in oil and coal.
6301 2018-12-05 15:37:36 Great hamper fillers
Hearty chutney 
Cornish oil
Trio of oil
Rapeseed oil, garlic oil and chilli oil 
all beautifully presented in these Italian glass bottles
6302 2018-12-05 15:37:33 Saudi's let oil prices fall to below 30 a barrel to teach us a lesson about US suppliers impeding on their market last time.  Trump's acting like he wants it this time.  Almost taunting them to do it.  Does he really wants what's best for America?  I think he has no plan.
6303 2018-12-05 15:37:28 A fact that is totally unrelated to current world events:

The US, Russia and Saudi Arabia are the three largest oil producing nations (together ~41% of global production).
6304 2018-12-05 15:37:23 He let a little white girl change his oil
6305 2018-12-05 15:37:19 Eventually no need for oil in our lifetime.
6306 2018-12-05 15:37:18 The flavor of your black cumin seed oil is subtle and delicious in apple juice, a smoothie, veggie drink or ginger tea. I love it!!
6307 2018-12-05 15:37:16 That is sucks but there isn't anything humans can do about this. Nothing we do will change it, especially restricting everyone's collective freedom to live as they wish.
6308 2018-12-05 15:37:16 Am I right in saying "power rests with big oil and they have no influence there" But you agree there is climate change but they haven't a hope in he'll solving it". Because they need #systemchange to achieve it.
6309 2018-12-05 15:37:15 Constructive critisism is good. inflation in coming days,when it will hit common man there will be backlash. For u &me Rs.100 incrs in gas bill or Rs1000 increase/mnth in electr., petrol or Rs 30 increas/ltr. In cooking oil cost does not matter but for95% population it will mater
6310 2018-12-05 15:37:13 Sure coal & gas are so clean! Oil needs to be more expensive so that it forces US corporations into free techs vs letting the market to China!
6311 2018-12-05 15:37:01 Actually higher oil prices might do the world some good! Kick that ass into high gear..step into 2018 & stop burning fossil for energy! Guaranteed.. throw an increasing carbon tax on here & cars will be ridin' 50miles to a gallon in NO time! lol but seriously. Why so Dumb Donald?
6312 2018-12-05 15:36:56 Ameen, Allah ya gafarta mata
6313 2018-12-05 15:36:56 You are wrong Christians one wife Muslims as many as oil in Saudi. He was like out he's a Christian but he betrayed Islam got to pay.
6314 2018-12-05 15:36:52 You could try using lavender oil across your temples and forehead. When I’m a bit insomniac, I do that and it doesn’t take as long to get to sleep. Hope you managed to get some shut-eye!
6315 2018-12-05 15:36:45 However, lawyers for big oil? We aren't talking someone who works at the local stop & rob here.
6316 2018-12-05 15:36:44 Uhh.. I actually work in the Texas oil industry. 

I know a surprisingly (for Texas) amount of blue collar workers who donated money. Not management (they're hardcore Republicans) but the actual people who do the work... They gave money to Beto.
6317 2018-12-05 15:36:43 So if we are talking about the here and now, the short answer is clearly no
6318 2018-12-05 15:36:39 My 88yo mom, started to take CBD oil for her back pain.
6319 2018-12-05 15:36:32 The#petrojamreport is a blot & stain on the @AndrewHolnessJM adminstration. He needs to act decisively. He could begin by following the money. Time to call in forensic auditors & investigators. Where did $5 billion of oil go??
6320 2018-12-05 15:36:22 OPEC’s gathering in Vienna comes at a tricky time for the oil industry and consumers who depend on the world’s largest source of energy.
6321 2018-12-05 15:36:20 I’ll have to start honey and vitamin E oil DIY facials.

6324 2018-12-05 15:36:11 More worker salaries required to produce less energy than oil can..... not much on thinking about what you talk about, eh?
6325 2018-12-05 15:36:04 BS - Where are the friggin boiled potatoes, much less grits and raisins, oatmeal, pasta w tomatoes, olive oil, rice, avacados, et AL. Why are we living in such a dump4?!?! Friggin BFE out here. Leverage the excise tax, raise the common awareness, abolish executions & legalize mj!
6326 2018-12-05 15:36:02 How about we start focusing on energy technology to make us less dependent on oil? #idiotinchief
6327 2018-12-05 15:36:00 Not turning the clock back he is using what we have at the time to make things easier on all.. As far as clean energy and the environment well that starts with us the consumers the ones burning through oil and such no one makes you buy a gas car or use the power grid for energy
6328 2018-12-05 15:35:59 Porque baja la nafta y sube el gas oil? Siendo que el gas oil se usa para trabajar y la nafta para pasear
6329 2018-12-05 15:35:48 you arent from northwest georgia if you dont eat pancakes with olive oil
6330 2018-12-05 15:35:44 Turkish rice.  Ingredients: green pea, olive oil, beet, large sliced leek, beef broth, bay, soy sauce, salt, and raisin.
6331 2018-12-05 15:35:43 @GhejiAmit conference in New Delhi in 2019 centred on Integrity in Sport. As Gulf Oil currently sponsors the Chennai Super Kings, and people are Cricket-crazy in India, we naturally will be focusing on Cricket and Hockey. Can we set up a quick call over Skype to discuss how...
6332 2018-12-05 15:35:34 They vowed to do so the minute Trump bowed out of the GCS and pledged his loyalty to coal and oil. And now his tariffs will make it even harder to get in on their game.
6333 2018-12-05 15:35:32 crude  - that is you and oil
6334 2018-12-05 15:35:30 The world needs HIGHER oil, coal, and even natural gas prices. ALL fossil fuel use needs to be reduced as quickly as economically feasible. Typical Trump "America Last" policy lets China and even Saudi Arabia dominate renewable energy technologies.
6335 2018-12-05 15:35:28 World needs higher oil prices to survive. #NotMyPresident
6336 2018-12-05 15:35:14 That’s a pretty uneducated opinion.  Even if we had 100% efficient solar/wind or replicable hydro (we don’t) you couldn’t transmit that energy across oceans.  Oil can be bottled and transported then burned for energy.  Actual energy transfer causes massive ‘line loss’.
6337 2018-12-05 15:35:13 If you see this, please take a moment to say a prayer for our sister @M__nadya who left us some hours ago, may Allah forgive and admit her into paradise, may he make her grave a pathway to Jannah.
May he forgive other deceased Muslims, and make us die as mu'meens when due.
6338 2018-12-05 15:35:12 ahahaha I hadn't seen that one yet (I don't really know how Twitter works either)
my friend from Alabama has trouble pronouncing "oil" and that's just American to American accents lol

6342 2018-12-05 15:34:59 ... he was never a progressive. He allowed the Lakota Sioux to be brutalized for oil profits for his friends. #MniWiconi #BrokenTreaties #GreedAgenda
6343 2018-12-05 15:34:51 It is but not sure why players are vilified, and not suggesting that is what you're doing Arash, for treating it like a business. It should be a two-way street. Lowry continues to do his job on the court & appears to be a helluva teammate. The rest shouldn't matter. #Raptors
6344 2018-12-05 15:34:49 I can also “throw around” the number 7 when it comes to death, oil & climate change. Just read Revelation Chapters 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16-19. The 7 heads are the previous 7 congressional districts of Harris County, TX of which GHWB was Rep. for TX-7 as WAS @johnculberson
6345 2018-12-05 15:34:45 SO I GUESS IT IS OK WITH YOU IF THE SAUDI PRINCE MURDERED ONE OF OUR CITIZENS AS LONG AS OIL PRICES STAY LOW, IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY?
6346 2018-12-05 15:34:39 It’s just people who can spot snake oil salesman and care for other people
6347 2018-12-05 15:34:38 I want higher oil prices!
6348 2018-12-05 15:34:37 What did #DonaldTheDeplorable expect would happen when he made Rick Perry Secretary of @Energy?

6351 2018-12-05 15:34:28 you're right.....what we need is to kick the oil habit all together!!!!!  WHERE ARE THE INVESTMENTS IN GREEN ENERGY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6352 2018-12-05 15:34:23 Oil
6353 2018-12-05 15:34:22 Blood flowed as well. Who will be next. Is it worth selling our soul for oil.
6354 2018-12-05 15:34:22 1. Don't you have a funeral to attend? 2. Higher oil prices would be good - reducing consumption would help the planet.
6355 2018-12-05 15:34:17 Wow Concord Mall gotta muslim oil kiosk

(hey, it works for NDT)
6357 2018-12-05 15:34:06 Government needs to stay out of oil prices.
6358 2018-12-05 15:34:03 Para para, bajo la nafta $60 ctvos. Ojo.  Ah, me olvide, subió el gas oil 3%. Ups.
6359 2018-12-05 15:34:03 Solid picks bro!!! $CPG performing well today. Oil is up futures market
6360 2018-12-05 15:33:59 Yo deadass idk how some of y’all be driving with your check engine light, low tire pressure lights on, oil change light on and shit lmao 
6361 2018-12-05 15:33:56 Didnt Saudi Aubria already pay you off, so dont need higher oil prices. Now go enjoy the non funeral and stay off of Twitter..
6362 2018-12-05 15:33:54 Back up Krassenstein! Denmark is leading in that area. USA may be a nice no 2. 
Why this constantly need for Americans to be the best?

But you're right America should go more green instead of being worried about oil prices.

6365 2018-12-05 15:33:50 Liberty, the 5 wise virgins were ready with the extra oil. Don’t get caught lacking, wototenga material.
6366 2018-12-05 15:33:50 .@IChemE there doesn't seem to be much public support for your recent web page celebrating 100 years of palm oil. Maybe its time to take a bit of marketing advice and consider what the public might judge to be charitable public benefit. .@ChtyCommission
6367 2018-12-05 15:33:47 When I go to Marshall’s, TJMaxx, etc, I always check the beauty and home goods sections. You can always find the neat products for half the price. One of the candle brands I like range from $14-21. I get it from Marshall’s for $7.99. Coconut oil $4.99.
6368 2018-12-05 15:33:43 Keep America pumping oil again!
6369 2018-12-05 15:33:41 Under our Constitution the Federal Govt has the power to declare the TM Pipeline a work of National Importance & mandate that it proceed without further debate or consultations. This is how the Railway was built.  WHY WON’T HE?? Because he hates OIL & he hates the WEST more 
6370 2018-12-05 15:33:37 Actually, oil is destroying the planet, so the world quite literally does need higher oil prices.
6371 2018-12-05 15:33:15 Yes - because higher oil prices will move you on to becoming ex president.
6372 2018-12-05 15:33:14 Ive asked @oil_is_opium about it. She lookit into it, wll uodat by the we it weekend. 
6373 2018-12-05 15:33:12 .. Weatherford's stock at around $0.60 cents. We see Schlumberger dropping like a rock. 

Are you at all familiar with the Oil and Gas industry or do you just comment on it because you're trying to make it a partisan issue?
6374 2018-12-05 15:33:09 We did not have extreme inflation except for the oil shocks. Our economy right now needs some inflation. It has been barely above zero for decades.

Anyway you were arguing that America worships and caters to the poor. Please continue your argument because I am not seeing it.
6375 2018-12-05 15:33:01 Focus should be on reducing energy demand, not in switching to imported shale gas and shale oil from US which pays no UK tax. We need strategic thinking !
6376 2018-12-05 15:33:00 Beef Jerky oil.. Straight Teriyaki flavor
6377 2018-12-05 15:32:58 *When* you need to get it checked depends on the oil. They'll tell you how many kms you can go. It's mentioned on the bottle too.

I just get it checked (along with other things) every few months.

You can also use a trip calculator (?) if your car has one.
6378 2018-12-05 15:32:58 Where would I get the oil from? 
6379 2018-12-05 15:32:52 cooking gyoza and i fucked up the oil : water ratio HAHAHAHAHA i need more sleep
6380 2018-12-05 15:32:51 Bye Scotland. Kiss goodbye to your oil revenues as well. That'll be part of your subscription & will become a pooled EU asset. You'll be buying it back from them with the pocket money Brussels give you out of your own contributions. 
6381 2018-12-05 15:32:50 mix bio oil vitamin e oil and Shae butter together.
6382 2018-12-05 15:32:47 I hate waiting to get a oil change
6383 2018-12-05 15:32:45 #3. If hand is soiled with oil and other fossil fuels, don't shake it (cf picture).
6384 2018-12-05 15:32:42 2 months na yata akong nagcacastor oil pero hindi pa humahaba ng bonggang bongga yung eyelashes ko. Pero kumakapal naman siya infairness. Skl ko lang
6385 2018-12-05 15:32:33 I’d probably use a 70/30 split of a rich night cream and coconut oil. 
6386 2018-12-05 15:32:27 people with too much time on their hands? guess they were tired of screwing the pooch and had to come up with something to prove they hadn't been spanking the monkey for the last month. on another note do you think the oil will get beat like a rented mule again tonight?
6387 2018-12-05 15:32:23 $tve $cpg $bte $egl 4 oil stocks I’m holding till summer. Let’s see how it looks then

6390 2018-12-05 15:32:18 Solar energy alone employs more Americans than coal, oil and gas combined, but green tech people don't vote Trump.
6391 2018-12-05 15:32:16 Why are you trying to TANK the American Economy? You want to Piss off MBS so that OPEC increases Oil Prices and Hence Gas Prices?

You are no friend of @realDonaldTrump and Saudi Arabia!
 @Scavino45 @kbsalsaud
6392 2018-12-05 15:32:16 Now is a good time to remind everyone that the Bush family made their fortune from selling oil to pre-WW2 Germany and helped Hitler rise to power.
6393 2018-12-05 15:32:11 You'd have to figure out which works best: full disclosure of all clients (unworkable IMO), categories of practice (but how detailed? Energy or Oil & Gas or Title Opinions for Oil & Gas or Real Estate, etc.), publicly known clients? And imputation Q could be overly burdensome 1/
6394 2018-12-05 15:32:09 $70 oil is what is needed.
6395 2018-12-05 15:32:03 Atiku is best for now for the problems they created in the first place...For 16years they couldn’t fix it even with oil boom ...Another 4 years of BUHARI will still meet your expectations but it will be better than Atiku ....

Anything but Atiku!

Thank you
6396 2018-12-05 15:32:02 Also, are we net importers or exporters of oil? How much garbage high sulfur fuel do you export? America first?
6397 2018-12-05 15:31:43 I just want 2bn out of that missing oil money 
6398 2018-12-05 15:31:39 He may have said he wanted to time travel to Vera Cruz. He’s hard to understand.
6399 2018-12-05 15:31:29 It wasn't true then. It was growing at an incredible pace when Blockbuster was shutting down at an incredible pace.

Exactly like how Oil and Gas companies are shutting down at an incredible pace. In O&G you'll have service companies the first to go, and what do we see? We see...
6400 2018-12-05 15:31:26 Palm oil
6401 2018-12-05 15:31:24 What happened to all the funds allocated to the police?? What about all the money police generates monthly from VIP protection and protection of banks, oil facilities and many more? Even if NPF receives £2bn per annum there won't be any change.
6402 2018-12-05 15:31:23 I spilt oil on my grey sweats 
6403 2018-12-05 15:31:21 Weird. Doesn’t the US export more oil than Saudi Arabia. Why does Trump hate Texas?
6404 2018-12-05 15:31:21 Why are we worried about the rest of the world when Texas alone can supply the oil needs for our entire country?  Why are you attempting to put US workers out of a job to kiss Saudi ass?
6405 2018-12-05 15:31:14 My friend said she uses bio oil, vitamin E oil and coconut oil daily... try that... she had a baby no stretch marks what so ever...
6406 2018-12-05 15:31:07 ﾜﾀｼﾓﾀﾞｱｲｽｷ！
6407 2018-12-05 15:31:03 America is oil independent. Lower gas prices will not affect our economy, as it would. Russia, who requires higher gas prices to sustain their economic stability.

6411 2018-12-05 15:30:52 More and more pts asking about cbd oil with dialysis. Any info on recommendations for its use or avoidance with dialysis?  I have a feeling this (or mj for some states)is going to become an increasingly asked question. #AskRenal

6414 2018-12-05 15:30:44 Finally,a president that is paying attention 2 things that matter the average American. Many have forgotten what it did 2 their pocketbook when oil prices spun out of control. Gas was over 4.00 pg & diesel was over 5.00 pg.People could no longer afford luxuries & some necessities
6415 2018-12-05 15:30:43 انا ل الله وانا اليه راجعون ...
 اللهمغفرلها ورحمها
6416 2018-12-05 15:30:42 That’s because they only buy trim from other LPs to turn into oil to ship to Germany at a higher price to keep their stocks up!
6417 2018-12-05 15:30:42 OPEC restricts oil production in 3...2...
6418 2018-12-05 15:30:41 no oil numbers today ?
6419 2018-12-05 15:30:37 Well-spotted, since we are talking about a pseudo-religion.
6420 2018-12-05 15:30:35 Okay at least one problem is solved, we have heat again. And can I just say having to use oil to heat your house is one of the most expensive fucking things ever. If you’re poor and don’t have great credit, good luck even getting oil delivered, let alone being able to pay for it.

6424 2018-12-05 15:30:24 You think you can say one thing while doing exactly the other & that we are all the dumb people you love who are in your cult or someone invested in oil & coal who no your full of crap but gain financially & ignore your nonsense

6428 2018-12-05 15:30:17 The tone of the comment seems to be that straight white men get away with doing the bare minimum. It's really not that serious and also by your logic shouldn't you be more worried about palm oil and human rights than what strangers say about Ed Sheerans baggy jeans on Twitter?

6430 2018-12-05 15:30:15 More countries should follow and dollar need to be stabilised and more crude oil prices and retail shouldn’t get affected by dollar inflations in the future.
6431 2018-12-05 15:30:13 The world "needs" less oil and more solar panels, Saudi is prime for solar energy, assuming the equipment can cope with the heat & the sand.  For your grandchildren to live & have children of their own you need to embrace renewable energy otherwise their future is lost.

6436 2018-12-05 15:29:55 @meinekecarcare I have called your customer care line for the past month. No 1 will call back even though one of your shops broke my oil pan. I had to add more oil. Your store mgr is rude & accusatory. I have a signed receipt of him confirming he broke the oil pan. Help me please
6437 2018-12-05 15:29:54 I would do some research on Beto. Beto’s “oil and gas money” came frm individuals working IN that industry & a majority of O&G employees work here in TX. Individual contributions requests disclosure of our work industry, and that’s how this information was bastardized.
6438 2018-12-05 15:29:50 Gaano kayo kagala ng pamilya mo?

6439 2018-12-05 15:29:43 Bank of Canada adds a few cups of water to its view that interest rates need to go back to neutral: oil crash, less pressure from retail gasoline prices, investment weakness, GDP revisions that may open up more room for growth without inflation. It could be a slow march #cdnecon
6440 2018-12-05 15:29:40 i beleave the oil rigs are owned by uk
so then what
seems no one reads history books about every time  some one tries to put all the power into one place it collapses

6441 2018-12-05 15:29:39 So covering for the royal family slaughter, of a journalist, only gets a hopefully? Guess you'll find out what false reporting to Congress gets you. Low oil prices put our production below break even. You really don't know anything, do you?

6444 2018-12-05 15:29:37 Myth: There is no such thing as sustainable #palmoil.

The certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm)—where oil palms have been grown for centuries...con't.
6445 2018-12-05 15:29:28 The first half of the movie is just Sam’s parents fucking while Bumblebee sprays oil all over the backyard.
6446 2018-12-05 15:29:28 Oh, I get it now. Cheap oil, burn more oil. Don't give a fuck about the environment.
6447 2018-12-05 15:29:26 Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate at 1.75% (Expect the Fed next week to do the same): key takeaways: "The global economic expansion is moderating largely as expected, but signs are emerging that trade conflicts are weighing more heavily on global demand." Oil prices
6448 2018-12-05 15:29:21 Big oil of Reagan, the Bushes, and now & later of Drumpf is the party of crimes of religious wars for oil and self-powers from oil wealth of the Koch's commands to put their men into public powers for personal wealth gains over us people is the GOP party of fascist!!
6449 2018-12-05 15:29:15 Where has capitalism worked? Socialism hasn’t been fully applied well due to the strong arming and bullying tactics of capital. Look at what the US did do Venezuela with hyperinflation, sanctions and an oil blockade. The same was done to Cuba but the island persevered.
6450 2018-12-05 15:29:09 With all that oil money dripping off of Beto, he’llcatch fire pretty easily 
6451 2018-12-05 15:29:08 Hi, apa selain parfum oil selalu ready?
6452 2018-12-05 15:28:59 Why not think of alternative fuels, rather than depending on oil and coal? I realise this is a difficult concept for you to grasp, but I'm sure there are grown ups in America who could help you understand more.
6453 2018-12-05 15:28:57 40% of our oil comes from Canada...
6454 2018-12-05 15:28:55 You only care about money and oil , try to be a real president in the right sense .

6458 2018-12-05 15:28:46 Do you realize how many things in your everyday life come from oil and gas not just cars the US is now the number one producer of oil and gas were gonna make a ton of money exporting to other countries

6462 2018-12-05 15:28:18 The world needs to cut its dependence on oil entirely. Or haven't you noticed the weather getting weird?
6463 2018-12-05 15:28:17 Unfortunately, there are idiots in Social Media talking about oil prices & alternatives other than oil. They basically don’t know anything about economic science coz always speech is easy & actions are harder.
6464 2018-12-05 15:28:16 oil.
6465 2018-12-05 15:28:11 Yeah. Tequila i guess..  Maybe but the first thought was yeah cooking oil

6468 2018-12-05 15:28:03 So, John Maynard Keynes tell me how low oil prices benefits america in a petro-dollar leveraged US oil economy. It is not the 70's people dont vote on the price of gasoline anymore

6477 2018-12-05 15:27:46 Aku oily juga kok. Jangan takut pake produk oil krn kulit kita dehidrasi makanya kulit otomatis "ngasih sinyal"  dengan keluarin oil, karena mereka pikir kita kekurangan oil dan kurang dehidrasi, itu yg nyebabin muka kita oily. Justru kalo di prepnya bener pake face oil+moist -c-
6478 2018-12-05 15:27:44 Now seriously, what kind of example would that set? The oil industry would never forgive him.
6479 2018-12-05 15:27:42 CBD oil is like decaf THC. 
Been a long term user of medicinal cannabis(illegally), but had to quit due to a new job. 

It feels like CBD oil has given me all the healthy benefits I appreciate in weed without the debilitating high.
6480 2018-12-05 15:27:39 Higher oil prices means higher demand which is one sign of healthy growth. What the US should do is reduce its demand on oil by using alternative fuel like solar, wind, hydroelectric & hydrogen. But not disgusting coal!
6481 2018-12-05 15:27:36 I have been taking hemp oil for about 4 months . I did notice the joint pain in my fingers is basically gone. Thoughts?
6482 2018-12-05 15:27:32 It's the rose oil! That's the only explanation! But thank you.

6491 2018-12-05 15:26:55 We could start by taking money from the gas & oil industry, raise taxes on the 1% stop corporate welfare..
6492 2018-12-05 15:26:54 Yes, just a mere $37.5 billion per year. Yet oil is one of the most profitable industries in the US.
6493 2018-12-05 15:26:53 Why should America be worried about world oil prices? Even at 200$ per barrel just put oil export ban nad no problem.
6494 2018-12-05 15:26:52 Seeing oil prices are controlled by the open market and supply and demand. I have to ask. What part of basic economics 101 flew over your head?
6495 2018-12-05 15:26:43 "Tankers" ... not takers. 

Bitumin is transported by sea with oil 'tankers'
6496 2018-12-05 15:26:39 The presentation is about why GM doing certain things, why the oil sector changing up and why US opted to change a major policy some years back.

Very informative and I can finally connect a few dots.

6504 2018-12-05 15:26:07 The strongest case for ditching oil is not saving the environment; we should ditch oil so the Gulf monarchies can be sidelined in to obscurity.
6505 2018-12-05 15:26:07 OPEC is keeping up production of oil in order to drive American frackers out of business. Once again, Trump puts Saudi interested s over the American.

6512 2018-12-05 15:25:42 I'm not political (and I hate political Twitter) but it is amazing that more people don't realize that almost ALL Trump's tweets are used to set up a patsy for when things go against him. Today's patsy: OPEC. Oil prices go up, don't blame Trump, blame OPEC. Teflon Don.

6525 2018-12-05 15:24:45 You obviously don’t understand that the energy industry employs a lot of Americans and higher oil prices, I’m not saying outrageous prices, but a good price to keep people employed is good for the country.

6537 2018-12-05 15:24:11 Higher prices would benefit companies extracting oil in the U.S. because the oil left here is hard to get out, in shale and so on. As a consequence, it’s also hideously more polluting, even than regular oil.

6544 2018-12-05 15:23:27 It pains me to say this as a tiller who consumers around 8k litres of oil a year, but everyone very much does wish to see higher, way higher oil prices, 1st mr trump you should rise the price in the US to EUs level :) oh and also fk you
6545 2018-12-05 15:23:25 Both countries have significant housing bubbles & high consumer indebtedness. Cdn household debt/income is 170%.

6559 2018-12-05 15:22:54 Happy Birthday future baby mama @KeriHilson! Which oil do you want for your foot rub tonight??
6560 2018-12-05 15:22:41 You are going to a funeral today.  Think hard how you want to be remembered. Keeping oil prices down to protect a murder (MBS) will be one of them.
6561 2018-12-05 15:22:40 That’s not exactly true, what we do is back down Production.and use up all their oil and then when the prices go high we turn our oil pumps back on. Been doing that since the 70s.
6562 2018-12-05 15:22:35 Again you show you don't understand the oil market. Lower oil is great for consumers but what about jobs? Lower oil prices negatively impact energy companies. There is always a losing end to low prices. Prob should stay out of it unless prices are back to $80/b and hurting again
6563 2018-12-05 15:22:32 Coal is going to go the way of whale oil.
6564 2018-12-05 15:22:31 Yes. We need very high oil prices! Then people will start to look at electrical cars!!
6565 2018-12-05 15:22:30 But if my memory serve me right were those oil use to come from that sell on the road and every corner
6566 2018-12-05 15:22:21 You see, Donny, the way you mis-structured your tweet this time effectively causes the 2nd sentence to read, "The World does not want to need higher oil prices." Perhaps you should find a third grader to write your tweets for you...#3rdgradelevel
6567 2018-12-05 15:22:20 how do i make oil :(( do i just not bathe for 10 days and collect the grease i drip
6568 2018-12-05 15:22:19 Read: I do not need higher oil prices
6569 2018-12-05 15:22:16 The people who live there aint alowed to cut down the trees n that to grow rice n food, but the wests big companies can do to grow palm oil plants, get a grip. Its greed nothing else. Bio-fuels my a-se. How many electric cars you seen run on chip pan fat or palmolive shampoo.mugs
6570 2018-12-05 15:22:16 #RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
6571 2018-12-05 15:22:16 Happy Birthday, Frankie.  PS: I added my email to your Outrageous Olive Oil subscriber list.   I’ll definitely check out your web site.
6572 2018-12-05 15:22:13 The U.S has about enough oil in strategic reserves for 36 days of normal use, though it would take 150 days to get it out of reserve, so normal use is not really possible.
6573 2018-12-05 15:22:10 Like how y’all be making all of that in that small space. Oil mixing and shit.
6574 2018-12-05 15:22:10 Use olive oil to massage your breasts. I saw an old South African lady with sexy breasts, she told me that she uses olive oil #NB Not my sugar momma

6580 2018-12-05 15:22:00 Mr. Tariff, please do not put tariffs on oil. Okay!
6581 2018-12-05 15:21:59 Surely you know that oil/gas/fracking/mining is extremely destructive to our air and water.  That is fact.

6584 2018-12-05 15:21:45 While Trudeau’s policy is to diversify Cda’s international trade, his banning of export pipelines is putting Cda’s oil economy in the hands of his nemesis Trump. Oh the #Irony
6585 2018-12-05 15:21:44 We should be investing in mobile clinics across every district in the country and employing health personnel to work in these clinics on shift terms like the oil rig engineers do. Also decentralise the health system so constituencies can run their own systems
6586 2018-12-05 15:21:43 By extension, this involves driving a car which you can feel comfortable in, control well, and have a unspoken connection to.

6591 2018-12-05 15:21:33 Your right. Just as Norway’s oil doesn’t belong to them, the Russian Gas doesn’t belong to them and the Texas oil fields don’t belong to the USA. Best of luck trying to convince those countries, they don’t have the same willingness to sell out their country.
6592 2018-12-05 15:21:32 Seeing we are now in control of the worlds biggest oil reserves. We would just start pumping and fracking more. Screw the Saudi’s

6597 2018-12-05 15:21:22 What are you ever going to do, to lessen our dependence on oil?  Your slavish behavior toward Saudi Arabia is horrifying to Americans.
6598 2018-12-05 15:21:22 When do we make our own American oil standard pricing. We are producing x3 then what we need nationally. Drive the price down better living better life better savings @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

6601 2018-12-05 15:21:01 I note comments regarding 'renewables' to replace oil. Stupid. No oil means unplug from the grid. Can society survive without the creature comforts they depend upon? No. Oil is not evil, the controllers are.

Your stop & frisk policies & defense of make you DOA in a dem primary, and running as an indy guarantees Trump.
6616 2018-12-05 15:20:01 Guess what being a lawyer for “big oil” in Texas & making an individual donation to a Democrat means. It means you’re a Democrat in Texas who needs to make a living. That’s where many, many jobs are. You’re arguing in bad faith.  Go away.

Oil is a "soon ending recource".
The price couldn't be high enough !
6625 2018-12-05 15:19:29 You are right! The world need more oil and coal! Cheaper as possible! To make sure that air gets more and more polluted! You are a genius!

6627 2018-12-05 15:19:28 I think it will depend on what OPEC does tomorrow. If they cut enough to boost oil prices, I think its off to the races.

6635 2018-12-05 15:18:56 Additionally in this age of global warming which we all know you deny exists, the USA should be building electric cars, wind farms, investing in solar energy and hydro power. Your foreign policy and oil wars is leading the Planet Earth on a one way ticket to Environmental Doom.
6636 2018-12-05 15:18:54 you and we all can't proceed as in the past.
Oil has to be more expensive to push the development of new technologies.
So your hope is again only driven by money not by intelligence.
6637 2018-12-05 15:18:53 When 45% of your state's tax revenue comes from oil, a "Green New Deal" really means "Sorry, no more 6 billion dollar surplus for you. No more 200 million a year in interest to spend on education and infrastructure." Stay in your lane, @Ocasio2018.
6638 2018-12-05 15:18:52 We don’t need oil.  We need this country to get it together and lead the world in moving to renewables.  However, I order to do this we need a President who thinks about something other than how much money he can make.  You are not for the people of this country, only yourself.
6639 2018-12-05 15:18:49 you see how western hypocracy is destroying this planet, cutting down jungle, rain forest to grow palm oil, n expect us to swallow the need for bio-fuels as the reason we need palm oil. Lies. Its so the rich can get richer, destroy the planet in our name. No thanks mate,

6642 2018-12-05 15:18:41 The oil products unaccounted for is huge!!!!
6643 2018-12-05 15:18:38 yet oil demand growth stays stable every year since the 80's go figure....
6644 2018-12-05 15:18:37 Ya so far been too nervous to trade it more than intra day, been trading uwt the 3x oil it's respected my ta fairly well so far intraday then gaps up or down a lot after hours

6646 2018-12-05 15:18:29 Acceptable oil will reduce the price of oil and we want to reduce the rate of deficit in all the mines if it is food and if it is used
6647 2018-12-05 15:18:28 Alberta cuts crude oil production by 325,000 barrels per day. Already new documentary capturing the situation has been release.  The films called, “Ralph Breaks The Oil Industry.” #WednesdayWisdom #cdnpoli
6648 2018-12-05 15:18:27 Exactly. Export and rape raw materials to cover deficits, no cash flow for growth of industry.. give  tankers of oil to generals to keep them loyal is next (see Venezuela) socialist losses  in capitalist societies is just slower. Yes we have no bananas
6649 2018-12-05 15:18:18 Will #opec raise #oil #price ?? next hit in market
6650 2018-12-05 15:18:17 Pretty sure oil prices rise because extraction and search for new deposits become harder, but ok

6652 2018-12-05 15:18:03 Hey Donny try not to be so ignorant. America does not need oil from OPEC!
6653 2018-12-05 15:18:02 I am stuck at the amount of oil unaccounted for. That’s the biggest irregularity.
6654 2018-12-05 15:18:00 Why is no one talking about the massive oil spill off Newfoundland?
6655 2018-12-05 15:18:00 I took the night time picture. So I can explain it. It was an oil refinery doing a burn on a very cold night. Sorry. No laser. But I do have other pics.
6656 2018-12-05 15:17:59 Canadian oil producers are gearing down output as is their right... either way Americans gain little from Trump’s war on the world.
6657 2018-12-05 15:17:55 Imagine if price of oil included actual costs to the environment, as well as the actual costs for the oil wars, including Japan & US oil embargo of Japan triggering Pearl Harbor, & US deposing Mosaddegh in Iran ultimately leading to the Mullahs, Iraq War, etc. Oil is too cheap.

6659 2018-12-05 15:17:46 Doesn't higher oil prices create jobs?
6660 2018-12-05 15:17:44 It boils down to this: the world's oligarchs are rich from oil which is now ruining the planet. They will fight to the death to keep their wealth.  It's us vs them. #ClimateChange

6671 2018-12-05 15:17:15 My opinion The Root of the problem is highly likely Simple. Because for Trump S. Arabia is very convenient & useful ally which operates with extremely huge Sum of investments in the World. and Very important issue for is also Oil Price.  Trump is interested in IPO of Saudi Aramco
6672 2018-12-05 15:17:12 So you're NOT going to increase tariffs on oil? Is that because you're beholden to Saudi Arabia over, hmmm....money?? #AlternativeFacts
6673 2018-12-05 15:17:03 The tech is not advanced enough at thos point to be sustainable.  Besides we have more than enough of our own natural gas and oil to not be dependant on others. Hiw about you work really hard to find something positive to say and not all the negativity all the time.

6675 2018-12-05 15:16:58 MR. PRESIDENT  we don't need to import cheap Chinese crap. It doesn't last long or work right! . We need American made products.  Open up our steel industry,  put our workers back to work on our infrastructure.  Energy,oil production,  food production.  Get tough on California.
6676 2018-12-05 15:16:56 Oil demand will grow for decades, but we should abandon the potential wealth it generates for Canadians... why? Get a clue.

6679 2018-12-05 15:16:48 How does a gas tax lower emissions?  If they were so worried, they would demand hydrogen fuel cell cars immediately.  However, big oil would be ipset over that, so nothing gets done.  Tech from the 60s would make a difference!

6684 2018-12-05 15:16:36 Actually higher oil prices would help spur on development of replacement fuels.
That's technology we could be driving the development of, if, you know, you weren't doing everything in your power to derail it.
Instead of America leading we will be following.
6685 2018-12-05 15:16:35 The world will not see anything if we don't cease this 100+ year-old oil fixation that is destroying the planet.
6686 2018-12-05 15:16:35 Has it ever occurred to you that the USA illegally  bombing and invading the Middle East like you have done in Syria and wagging the dog with Iran has an awful lot to do with the oil prices? Stop waging imperialist oil wars and get out. War mongering war criminal

6695 2018-12-05 15:16:01 Are low oil prices worth the life of a Washington Post Reporter? Your hands will forever, BE TAINTED WITH THE BLOOD OF KHASHOGGI.
6696 2018-12-05 15:15:59 Outside of the oil companies, nobody wants to be dependent on oil.  It's just an unfortunate nessecity right now.  There has to be some technalogical advances with renewables to  make them advantageous as a productive source of power.
6697 2018-12-05 15:15:57 is because of Crude oil too much money Saudi Arabia Crown Prince killed Kashoggi and many people they have murdered in cold blood and know one will talk.
God of America is watching.
6698 2018-12-05 15:15:54 A healthy week for crude period market with interest shown in long-term contracts. Quiet for clean period market as the Christmas festivities begin. Oil prices have remained under pressure ahead of this week’s OPEC meeting, it is thought crude production cuts will be announced.
6699 2018-12-05 15:15:54 I got some Johnson and Johnson BABY OIL 
6700 2018-12-05 15:15:52 We need to stop using oil.
6701 2018-12-05 15:15:51 I thought you were the Great Captain Of Industry. Yet, here you are, cap in hand, begging OPEC to not screw you over. So much for your facade of power and shrewdness. Just another charlatan. Just another snake oil salesman. #Trumponomics
6702 2018-12-05 15:15:50 All of those still need oil!
6703 2018-12-05 15:15:46 I guess. He seemed nice I suppose but the Bush family business is oil and no family in US history has been cozier with the Saudis than them. So yeah. Enough is enough. Sayonara.
6704 2018-12-05 15:15:42 VP George H.W Bush arrived in Marib  in April 86. Along with President Ali Abdallah Salih, inaugurated US- built refinery to produce 10,000 bpd from Alif Oil field. Yemeni troops stood guard while 100s of Yemenis and gusts attended the ceremony. @GHWBush1924
6705 2018-12-05 15:15:36 Tweets about oil. Liberals attack with funeral? Wut
6706 2018-12-05 15:15:33 Need my car checked and oil changed 
6707 2018-12-05 15:15:30 Ooh for Christmas? I hope I get something nice. Probably oil again.
6708 2018-12-05 15:15:22 I know plenty of Puerto Rican who served as soldier for the banks, pharma and oil companies in the Middle East. Most of them came back fucked up and questioning their reason for been there.
6709 2018-12-05 15:15:20 Fracking US Oil is floating the Oilmarket.. you export now more oil than Venezuela or Nigeria..  the US oil industry needs high oil price...
6710 2018-12-05 15:15:18 We don't need oil.
We need alternative energy sources. Wind, sun, water...
6711 2018-12-05 15:15:08 You really out there losing money when you could be selling selfmade oil

6714 2018-12-05 15:14:54 Bullshit

    Canada: US$53.3 billion (38.3% of total US imported crude oil)
6715 2018-12-05 15:14:52 Which will hurt the price of our own oil exports.
6716 2018-12-05 15:14:52 Trumps accomplishments:
-deny climate change 
-deny intel for American laws enforcement agencies for oil and money
-lies everyday to protect himself and maintain his base who follows him blindly 

Oh what a great potus?
6717 2018-12-05 15:14:51 I’m more interest in the 600,000 barrels of oil worth 5.2 billion
6718 2018-12-05 15:14:45 You ain't seen nothing yet. Pipeline capacity for the Permian oil fields will double next year, ending the supply bottleneck, and further lower the price per barrel.  We're taking on OPEC and we're going to win.
6719 2018-12-05 15:14:43 "The whitest and craziest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
6720 2018-12-05 15:14:37 Reinstate the 40 year ban on selling US crude to foreign countries. The US would be energy independent right now & free of the Middle East oil.
Hope is not a strategy.
6721 2018-12-05 15:14:34 Thanks sir, too kind! I think the fact that there’s no thick lacquer, only linseed oil and wax really helps bringing out the grain. That said, I’ve been lucky because the guitar was originally painted and usually they don’t use their best wood

6723 2018-12-05 15:14:34 Why should countries like Canada, who you get oil from for a very cheap price right now, go in debt for you? You treat countries like shit, threaten them, and then you expect them to play nice.
6724 2018-12-05 15:14:29 Oil? We got us clean coal, baby. We don't need no steenking oil.
6725 2018-12-05 15:14:29 Here is what I'd do with the first sentence: "It would be beneficial to OPEC as well as in the best international interest to keep all oil flowing at its current volume, as opposed to implementing any restrictions"

Second sentence: Remove all commas.
6726 2018-12-05 15:14:26 Iceland did right, banning palm oil advert. Haveyou seen the devastation palm oil greed has done to malaysia, indonesia to name a few. Cuting down rain forest n jungle for palm oil. Not food not rice, palm oil. Western sh-t destroying the planet. Good ole iceland.
6727 2018-12-05 15:14:24 If we had less dependence on oil the price of oil would go down. You can’t see this because you’re too stupid. Another thought, you won’t see this because you’re too greedy and making money of it somehow.
6728 2018-12-05 15:14:23 She also created SF first environmental justice unit. She went after polluters like BP, Chevron, Exxon and forced the Cosco Busan into the largest settlement for a oil spill. Stop making absurd comments about a woman without looking her record up
6729 2018-12-05 15:14:23 Η Motor Oil έκλεισε στα 21,60 ευρώ με άνοδο 2,37% όγκο 104 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 2,39 δισ. ευρώ
6730 2018-12-05 15:14:18 Ahh... But how would the oil and gas lobby's be able to afford to buy politicians?
6731 2018-12-05 15:14:15 If the cost of the two projects is public information, and the intention is public interest, then why not?
6732 2018-12-05 15:14:14 We also need to focus on how to be less dependent on imported oil as well as saving consumers money as well.
6733 2018-12-05 15:14:11 Standard oil used it's masdive sales volume and market dominance to undercut his competitors on price and drive it's competitors out of business. Up until that time period, gasoline was seem as a 'waste product' to the profitable Kerosene. Then the automobile arose.
6734 2018-12-05 15:14:01 Marry someone who would give you a hot oil head massage.
6735 2018-12-05 15:14:00 Hopefully some sensible person will become president and realise that we need to do something to save our planet from the emerging climate catastrophe.  We need more renewable energy, like solar, wind and hydro power, without CO2 emissions.  We need to stop using coal and oil.
6736 2018-12-05 15:13:57 The world should not be dependent on oil, period. Time to close all the wells and start converting all machines to run off zero point generators. Times up.
6737 2018-12-05 15:13:53 Hmm interesting point re Beto taking oil money was all over twitter yesterday- apparently started by frmr Bernie spokesman David sirota. Start your research into that thread of deliberate misinformation - he’s been roundly exposed. Looks like Bernie is worried about a Beto run.
6738 2018-12-05 15:13:51 This tells Canada everything we need toknow about our relationship with USA re oil.
1) plan is to choke out CDN business and force corp sales
2) foreign investors (USA) pick up properties/equipment cheap
3) reaffirms who is really funding the climate/tar sands war on CDN business
6739 2018-12-05 15:13:51 We get our oil from Canada...
6740 2018-12-05 15:13:51 That was told to me by my former LP, blew me out the chair? I repeated “palm oil’ I asked if that’s what they used from the beginning 3 yrs, they said yes

6742 2018-12-05 15:13:47 krassenstein realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't understand the economics of anything, let alone oil.  Meanwhile his administration is cutting tax credit for electric vehicles while strongly pushing for coal.  Coal not only kills people but it is a large contributor of global warming.
6743 2018-12-05 15:13:47 realDonaldTrump How about we stop being so dependent on oil, and instead focus on wind, solar and hydro energy?

We could become the leaders in these technology and other nations would be dependent on us.

Instead you want to turn the clock back decades and depend on the res…

6746 2018-12-05 15:13:40 For the sake of all that is holy, shut up. Yesterday your stupid twits kept the stock markets dropping with each tweet, are you trying to do the same with oil? The biggest threat to the American economy is you. You are a total failure as a businessman and president. Resign!
6747 2018-12-05 15:13:37 Oil
6748 2018-12-05 15:13:33 So.......not America first? American oil production. Is grinding to a halt due to opec and the rapid drop in price.

6752 2018-12-05 15:13:25 Or we could switch to renewable energy and stop worrying about oil prices altogether. Just spitballing here.
6753 2018-12-05 15:13:21 dont know much about oil and it's relation to recession but yeah its possible but i  would trade it one level at a time
6754 2018-12-05 15:13:21 What difference does it make with oil and $50 a barrel gas should be under a dollar a gallon were paying over three dollars a gallon here in California looks to me like the American oil companies are raping us
6755 2018-12-05 15:13:20 Our four days of mourning are almost up. Let me know when the second son of oil dies.
6756 2018-12-05 15:13:17 I literally try and take everything I can to stop the sadness... Bye take vitamin B6 & magnesium, iron calcium and vitamin D. Take this every day. St John's wart is good for when I'm particularly low mood and evening primrose oil xx
6757 2018-12-05 15:13:15 For people that work in the oil field absolutely. When American oil companies can no longer make a profit on oil prices they shut down exploration which causes massive lay offs and a dependance on foreign oil.
6758 2018-12-05 15:13:14 These are temporary measures. The previous Governments did not raise PR fares to keep pace with the real cost. They were subsiding and the organization was run down to huge deficits. I am warning against our oil imports problem where PR is a big user. PR has to change fuel type.
6759 2018-12-05 15:13:13 
 - religious leaders and cultures work against birth control
- oil and gas slow down transfer to renewables and electric car
- auto makers have slowed down electric car
- low energy prices have slowed down renewables
- wasteful consumption and food waste 
- deforestation
6760 2018-12-05 15:13:10 OPEC has dominated the world's oil markes for decades but soon this will B over! America and Israel will B the top producers of energy in the global market! OPEC stocks will bottom out And America will no longer B dependent on OPAC! Can't wait! Thank U Pres Trump! Stay strong!
6761 2018-12-05 15:13:09 Oil rose from $61 to $61.96 per barrel today.

Let me know if you require any further positive news about Nigerian.

Notice! 

I have an habit of magnifying the positives around me.

6763 2018-12-05 15:13:07 Your friends in Saudi Arabia are driving down oil prices in order to put U.S. oil producers out of business, dingus. Open your eyes and see the reality.

6769 2018-12-05 15:12:50 Get us off oil!!! It’s our Achilles heel. If you read you’d know what that is
6770 2018-12-05 15:12:50 Since you literally let them get away with murder the least they can do is hold oil prices- can’t wait until I see you handcuffed & perp walked out of the WH- THAT is reality TV #divisivedonald #lockhimup
6771 2018-12-05 15:12:50 Canada exports more oil to the US than any of the OPEC nations. If you only had your facts straight, you wouldn't be one of the worst presidents in US history.
Oil companies have more to do with setting prices than the countries exporting oil. They use OPEC as a smokescreen.

But don't let facts get in the way of your business dealings with dictators and murderers. G'head, ya Drumpf! #Mueller sees all.
6777 2018-12-05 15:12:27 You just need all the appurtenances like a saffron robe, mustard oil sheen on your tonsured head and hey presto a soi-disant ‘yogi’ is there alive and kicking.
6778 2018-12-05 15:12:25 Try this for brunch tomorrow? Saute shallots in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add pork chop and vodka sauce. Cook thoroughly. Serve with pretzel roll and a bit of lime.
6779 2018-12-05 15:12:22 Nobody made the gold, minerals,oil, land, airwaves. Why then only a few enjoy the profit from these? A new social contract is a must to correct this. #UBI

6781 2018-12-05 15:12:18 we hope oil prices will move above 100 $ soon , it is better to our economy 
6782 2018-12-05 15:12:17 Indeed.

Do the Saudis use their oil a lot, or not ? 

Aussies must be a special kind of ... (smart) ?

6785 2018-12-05 15:12:12 "Hopefully" ?
Does this pass for global negotiation?
Only thing keeping oil lower, like interest rates, is a global recession brought on by....

6788 2018-12-05 15:12:09 IF YOUR GOING TO TRY ACTING AS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT  TRY LEARNING SOMETHING FIRST.. HERES AN IDEA! TRY TO MEND THE DAMAGE YOU CREATED WITH CANADA, WE RECEIVE MORE OIL FROM THERE THEN THE M.E !
6789 2018-12-05 15:12:08 It's a really good point that Thatcher coincided with the oil. Even with that finance behind them they've managed to make a mess of things. The money generated in Aberdeen and we're still needing food banks, and a Tory using it to publicise himself. Couldn't make it up.
6790 2018-12-05 15:12:03 OPEC's Economic Commission Board recommends 1.3mbpd cut in oil supply; Will Saudi loose face within OPEC and with Russia?; Canadian province mandates 325kbpd oil production cut; Iran & Venezuela's output on d decline; risks to naija production abounds. OPEC's meeting loading
6791 2018-12-05 15:12:00 Too low of oil prices hurt American oil workers and makes alot of high paying jobs disappear. That means less tax revenue and rural communities that depend on oil workers to spend their money at their businesses get hurt really bad
6792 2018-12-05 15:11:58 Yet another reason to #Resign. RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
6793 2018-12-05 15:11:51 Snake oil salesmen
6794 2018-12-05 15:11:47 You have absolutely no idea how the world economy or oil production and delivery operates. You have no idea how OPEC operates or the fact that they're actually becoming far more minimal an oil producer than ever before as compared to the US with others. Get a clue.

6802 2018-12-05 15:11:13 It mean ,Iran as OPEC member can  flow the oil like others  OPEC members?
It's very good news for the Iranians public who pose to suffer enormously,
Thanks  Mr President Trump.
God bless you,.
You will earn respect in both times  like now and hereafter,
6803 2018-12-05 15:11:10 Let us not forget, "No Blood for Oil"; and before that there was Panama.  The man believed firmly that "Might makes Right" and he was wrong.

6808 2018-12-05 15:10:58 Why we need to reduce use of fossil fuels. We have electric cars; no need to be beholden to other countries for oil/fuel. Seems were in a doomsday scenario; need to turn that back around.
6809 2018-12-05 15:10:56 I live far from you but i could and WANT fuck to the beat of a oil drill
6810 2018-12-05 15:10:53 yes. That's how a snake oil salesman aka #DonTheCon aka @realDonaldTrump sells the 'oil'.
6811 2018-12-05 15:10:52 Is this part of your "Art of the Deal" Murder for Oil Prices? You truly have no human descency. You're a soul-less individual. This is NOT who we are as a Nation but this is who you are as a man. Money above all and not even for the Nation but for your own personal bottom line.
6812 2018-12-05 15:10:42 Oil is no longer required as there are sustainable alternatives as you note.
6813 2018-12-05 15:10:41 All good thanks, was oil burning off new exhaust/ coupled with fan bringing smoke in. 
6814 2018-12-05 15:10:32 Sorry Ed.  While we tried to deny climate change and prop up big oil China became the world's largest manufacturer of advanced tech including wind turbines and solar panels.

6818 2018-12-05 15:10:22 Or we could just up the push for clean energy and buy less oil. Rather than wishing we could pay less to feed our addiction, we could kick the habit. If we cut our use of fossil fuels, the price would plummet. But, of course, your big oil buddies wouldn't like that, would they?

6823 2018-12-05 15:10:11 OPEC uses Oil Prices as Tariffs on the US Economy. 
6824 2018-12-05 15:10:11 It goes to show how much bullshit is out there regarding the oil sands and how clueless suckers lap it up because their loyalty to their ideology is greater than their willingness to verify information... Much like you.
6825 2018-12-05 15:10:10 Black seed oil. I use it for my face every night because my skin is very dry, especially in the winter.
6826 2018-12-05 15:10:04 Shale oil is not heavy oil. You write as if you’re knowledgeable and people should listen to you. Buy you’ve betrayed your ignorance.

6829 2018-12-05 15:10:00 Ignorance ? How about the snp confirming by the way oil went if Scotland had went independent it would have went bankrupt. But your too ignorant to even address that issue eh ? Cover your eyes and ears you can't hear it 
6830 2018-12-05 15:09:59 It will reduce US oil production due to higher production costs here in America.
6831 2018-12-05 15:09:53 Actually, higher oil prices are exactly what we need. Thats your free market at work, driving the development of superior technologies, bitch.

6833 2018-12-05 15:09:51 Nothing. It simply means you can spot a oil salesperson a mile off.
6834 2018-12-05 15:09:51 We dont even get much oil from them! Europeans are the ones dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Or is this to make sure that Europe stays dependent on Middle Eastern oil as apposed to Russian oil and thus keeping the power dynamic as it currently is?

STOP arresting people vaping THC Oil! This is unconscionable! 

THC oil continues to be charged as a controlled substance under the same statute as heroin possession. 23 arrests between Sept. 4 and Nov. 12! = #WTF
6836 2018-12-05 15:09:46 Cad act like they saw oil first time in months
6837 2018-12-05 15:09:42 How about distancing us from our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy sources?? Wouldn't that make more sense than begging for lower oil prices??? You haven't got  a fking clue how much we need this to happen.....
6838 2018-12-05 15:09:40 solar won't work, we consume too much. It is supplemental at best, we're  better off on making electronics consume less power.
Wind also has a problem of needing a lot of fucking space just to compare to one coal plant, shit it is worse than OIL ones.
6839 2018-12-05 15:09:40 That is half the problem, the other half is the taxes that are put on oil and gas which is from our own local, state, and federal government.
6840 2018-12-05 15:09:40 Once you add the hidden oil revenues we would be close to Ireland GDP
6841 2018-12-05 15:09:36 Should we go back to those who devalued it from 20/$ to 200/$?? Despite earning over $800b&borrowing $63b within the time and leaving FxR at $28 which we couldn't use to defend the Naira when oil crashed to $28/b from high $147??

Where is ur sense of context??

6843 2018-12-05 15:09:33 The world may not want, but absolutely needs, higher oil prices.

Renewables offer long term sustainability, employment opportunities and new markets for business to transition into.

6845 2018-12-05 15:09:21 So Donald you do realize that low oil prices will lead to unemployment for American oil field workers, don’t you? Is this what you mean by America first, unemployment first?
6846 2018-12-05 15:09:18 This glut is driving down the price of Alberta’s oil, costing Canadians $80 million a day.
6847 2018-12-05 15:09:17 I urge America, European countries to stop price of Crude oil to go up again world will be better than before, killing will stop,  Soponsoring ISIS will stop,  Supporting Militants will stop,  world will have Security and Zero Terrorism. $20 US Dollars Crude oil price is ok.
6848 2018-12-05 15:09:16 80% of our oil in the United States comes from Canada
6849 2018-12-05 15:09:15 Big, If True! RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!

6859 2018-12-05 15:08:41 We are not dependent on Saudi Arabian oil and you've already shown that you don't give a crap about our allies so what's the game you're playing?
6860 2018-12-05 15:08:39 That is not correct. Canada oil comes from fracking and is cheaper per barrel. It is why the Alberta government is looking to cut production
6861 2018-12-05 15:08:30 Capitalist governments have done it before with obviously social goods (like oil or other resources) - expanding it to stocks would be harder but not unreasonable

6866 2018-12-05 15:08:17 Maybe oil needs to stop being a global commodity and sold as a commodity of its producers at their own price

6872 2018-12-05 15:07:49 Did you know?

Ottawa isn’t imposing the same taxes and regulations on Saudi oil that it imposes on Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland oil?
6873 2018-12-05 15:07:46 Just stop giving Wisconsin any financial support. Raise thier oil cost and no disaster relief and see how quickly they will come to the plate

6875 2018-12-05 15:07:39 And we continue to subsidize the oil industry because billions in quarterly profits aren’t enough.
6876 2018-12-05 15:07:37 yeah idk if we hit those levels probably don’t stop falling. Like catching an oil drop falling knife
6877 2018-12-05 15:07:33 We have cars that requires no oil fuel but yet this idiot is still sweating OPEC about oil going up or down....How about depending purely on electricity to power cars??? Oh Wait theres too much money at stake here!!!

6879 2018-12-05 15:07:27 I dont agree with you on you politics.
But I agree we dont need oil below 50.00 as american oil companies will start laying off. 
And sure lets do all the renewables 
But keep using oil/Coal till the rest is actually well feasible.

6891 2018-12-05 15:07:00 The world does not "need" oil at all. There are plenty of alternatives. You and your elite "buddies" would just prefer us to use oil so we can fund your GD life.

6899 2018-12-05 15:06:46 No disagreement from me on that.  I am no oil expert but 600,000 barrels of oil unaccounted for! 5.2 billion! No sah
6900 2018-12-05 15:06:42 Are you seriously tweeting about oil during a funeral?

6902 2018-12-05 15:06:33 if pakai makeup / Foundation tebal better bersihkan skin dengan oil cleansing dulu lepastu baru pakai cleanser. Mcm i selalu pakai garnier micellar water tu je lepastu cuci muka pakai soap. Sbb tak selau pakai fd. Just skincare & suncreen. :)
6903 2018-12-05 15:06:29 Hope you feel that same way if you decide to get in the oil business.. we all remember the Bush/Cheney oil days when because of that horrendous GOP war and Cheney oil interests gasoline reached ungodly prices destroying a once good economy.  GOP does this crap every time!
6904 2018-12-05 15:06:28 Only in about 50 years when the oil finally runs out or it drops to about 20$ a barrel 
6905 2018-12-05 15:06:26 Bet you’d let an OPEC member murder a journalist to keep oil prices low in a feable attempt to make it look like you have some sort of influence over them. Oh, wait...
6906 2018-12-05 15:06:24 No OPEC must  stop oil flows as it is now bcs this will harm countries that depend on oil economically and they must defend their interests  rather than protecting yours.
6907 2018-12-05 15:06:24 The oil belongs to them.  I want it to stay low but don't think your tweet will make any difference.
6908 2018-12-05 15:06:24 Legit question: when oil prices are tanking because ppl are concerned about Indigenous consultation, the environment, and other valid concerns, why are we fighting to find ways to alter the economy to make it work instead of investing in new, cleaner, safer energy? #abpoli
6909 2018-12-05 15:06:19 The lack of gratitude is depressing. Without fossil fuels we would still be using 18th century technologies.  Food scarcity & starvation would still be the norm, as much as we might not want Type 2 Diabetes, rather suffer that fate then watch children die in US streets.
6910 2018-12-05 15:06:16 The keyword is "used to be". Did you work for big oil and give to campaigns? I'm guessing no & you know damn well that isn't even remotely the same.
6911 2018-12-05 15:06:16 Speak for yourself. My job depends on oil prices as do most people in my industry.
6912 2018-12-05 15:06:15 You do know we get most of our oil from Canada right?
6913 2018-12-05 15:06:15 Yes it does...the US IN PARTICULAR. Without oil prices at a certain level, it doesn’t make sense to expand domestic oil shale/sand production. Cheap oil kills those jobs.
6914 2018-12-05 15:06:11 Like a true Norwegian, I believe most problems can be solved with the right combination of water, exercise, and cod-liver oil
6915 2018-12-05 15:06:08 Indeed, the world doesn't need higher oil prices.
Lessons from France #YellowVests
6916 2018-12-05 15:06:07 Don't waste their oil money though do they ?
6917 2018-12-05 15:06:07 Hehehe. US buys 40% of its oil from Canada and the Alberta province is looking to cut production.
6918 2018-12-05 15:06:03 Canada is actually restricting oil production because we're getting screwed by having only 1 buyer. While we also buy Saudi oil.

The energy game is a big messed up thing right now.
6919 2018-12-05 15:05:59 Hey tariff man, if you take credit for when the stock market goes up then you should take the blame when the market goes down 800 points like yesterday. Please stop with the inane tweets and leave oil prices alone we need the jobs
6920 2018-12-05 15:05:56 Would love to gather interest on an Essential Oil class...I can do an Intro class for those that have NO idea about them...or a pampering Make and Take class (this has a small fee)...or an Oils of the Bible Class...would love some feedback on what my local friends need most!
6921 2018-12-05 15:05:52 1/2 Ok I need to rant. Yesterday one of my roommates spilled some cooking oil on the floor and didn’t clean it up. I didn’t see it and slipped, smacking my shoulder on the edge of the bench (I now have a massive bruise and it’s very painful)...

6923 2018-12-05 15:05:33 Worst outcome for a user of snake oil probably be diarrhea.  What these folks peddling is far more dangerous.

It may give our society diarrhea,  like the epidemic we saw in 1930s.
6924 2018-12-05 15:05:32 Yes, the world does need higher oil prices, so that renewable energy takes over.
6925 2018-12-05 15:05:31 Thanks to President Obama we are now less dependent on foreign oil.  US #1 producer!  Thanks #Obama
6926 2018-12-05 15:05:30 We are sitting on possibly the largest oil field in the world.  We DON'T need Saudi oil from murderers!  Stop letting companies export our natural resources and push green power.  Good grief.

6928 2018-12-05 15:05:29 Go to a dentist. Or get clove oil. Works wonders
6929 2018-12-05 15:05:29 Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices, says thr US President Trump in a tweet.
6930 2018-12-05 15:05:28 US #shale #oil industry will be dismantled with lower #oil prices. US #shale #oil industry needs reasonable #oil prices to keep investing and employing 100s of 1,000s Americans. US has secured an important source of energy using more domestic #oil instead of importing it.
6931 2018-12-05 15:05:27 QATAR is leavin OPEC and who cares what they do?? THE US is now the LARGEST PRODUCER OF OIL! We no longer really require the Middle East!
6932 2018-12-05 15:05:25 we have more oil than the saudies, why are we exporting when it is needed in usa ?
6933 2018-12-05 15:05:21 Bank of Canada doesn't hike interest rates. Some key lines:

-Signs are emerging that trade conflicts are weighing more heavily on global demand
-Oil prices have fallen sharply 
-Activity in Canada’s energy sector will likely be materially weaker than expected
6934 2018-12-05 15:05:20 I haven't heard of the leap manifesto.  But thanks to this I am going to learn about it. Eventually we will need to use renewable energy.  It can't be denied. So we might as well start planning for now for a transition even if we try to save our current oil industry
6935 2018-12-05 15:05:15 We've gone Iceland because (a) very nice last year (b) no palm oil and (c) very little choice anyway. (b) probably chief reason.

6937 2018-12-05 15:05:12 Dont care rising or falling oil prices. Everytime I get gas 50$
6938 2018-12-05 15:05:09 Let's not forget the Iran Contra fiasco or Iraq War that was going to restore Kuwaiti oil but didn't and was just a ruse to protect the oil from being traded with Iran and destabilized American Petro Dollars.

6942 2018-12-05 15:05:04 What do you say to the people of Bangladesh and the Tuvalu islands who are loosing land due to climate change when their carbon impact is minimal? They can live underwater, their freedom isn't impacted by all of this
6943 2018-12-05 15:05:00 Excellent article. It should be clear that the T2/Buttz cabal is determined to transform Canada into a 'post-national' (read ultra-left) state, and to destroy the heavy oil industry in Alberta as well. Complacent voters in ON, QC and points east seem to be OK with all this.
6944 2018-12-05 15:04:59 He thinks if he tweets about the oil and China that the stock market will start going back up. Your words mean nothing, actions is what makes the stock market not your tweets!
6945 2018-12-05 15:04:58 except probably OPEC wants to see, or need, higher oil prices
6946 2018-12-05 15:04:58 We need oil prices to go up some Mr President
6947 2018-12-05 15:04:56 Africa had all the gold, diamonds, oil etc and the white man had bible. Now Africa have the Bible and the white man have all the gold, diamonds and oil......smh
6948 2018-12-05 15:04:51 Wonder what Trump would have done if Canada had threatened to either raise oil prices or cut oil export to the US when Trump threatened to impose tariffs on automobiles and ruin the Canadian economy, maybe we still should until steel and aluminum tariffs are removed.
6949 2018-12-05 15:04:50 In the name of asparagus, kale, and coconut oil (in moderate amounts) amen
6950 2018-12-05 15:04:47 BoC leaves rates unchanged. It still thinks interest rates must rise to a “neutral range,” the pace will depend on a “number of factors,” especially the “persistence of the oil price shock,” business investment, and the “bank’s assessment of the economy’s capacity.” $CAD
6951 2018-12-05 15:04:44 Think about this for a second, dingus. The lower oil prices go the less profit U.S. oil producers make. The less profit they make the more people they lay off. The more people they lay off the less your promises to protect American workers mean. Get the picture?
6952 2018-12-05 15:04:41 This is not the time to be burning oil like there's no tomorrow.  You do know that we are the main cause of the oil glut, don't you?  OPEC is trying to adjust so you don't make production unprofitable.  The floor is about $44/barrel.   You don't know what you are doing at all.
6953 2018-12-05 15:04:38 A #President and #WarHero is being buried today and here you are tweeting about freaking oil.

Get your clothes on and get out of the house.
6954 2018-12-05 15:04:38 FYI Trump become President because the so-called GOP 'WASPs' made white working, middle class almost disappear with decades extreme right policies, then GOP made same people believe a snake oil salesman like Trump would save them from devastating effects. Nah, WASPs must go away!
6955 2018-12-05 15:04:38 Oh good, now you want to start the big layoffs again, when we had to get OPEC to SLOW own their oil production.  Are you NUTS!
6956 2018-12-05 15:04:37 If we switched to renewable resources, we wouldn't have to worry about the price of oil.
6957 2018-12-05 15:04:34 Ditto for Big Pharma  Military Industrial Complex (spintanks) and Big oil and mobile phones.
6958 2018-12-05 15:04:32 Stop spilling your oil all over and shut up you need to stop screaming for no reason
6959 2018-12-05 15:04:30 ลาก่อนนนนนนนนน บช เคลื่อนไหวไม่ได้เลยช่วงนี้
6960 2018-12-05 15:04:26 So still don’t understand how she can claim to offset the millions of tonnes of CO2 that all that oil represents. And as far as jobs go, if we spent the oil subsidy monies in all its forms on demand side management-
6961 2018-12-05 15:04:23 ですよね
まぁ、低武力槍にそれらをつけても効果薄いですし、李儒さんは長槍にしときます
6962 2018-12-05 15:04:20 The world does not need OIL !
6963 2018-12-05 15:04:08 Already being done! Renewables depend upon oil, just like everything we consume. Nice try though!
6964 2018-12-05 15:04:01 You do realize it takes oil to make wind and solar power
6965 2018-12-05 15:03:59 The security restrictions are a huge reason I've all but given up on wanting to be President.

6967 2018-12-05 15:03:53 "Cheesy singles"

"Supports sustainable palm oil"

The moral of the story is British people eat garbage too, it's not just Americans.
6968 2018-12-05 15:03:50 Increase taxes on 1% and eliminate tax breaks & subsidies for oil & gas industries. That would be a huge start.
6969 2018-12-05 15:03:45 If OPEC is doing anything it is restricting output. It is the only thing it does.  Every day since its founding oil flows have been restricted and regulated.
6970 2018-12-05 15:03:44 I don't see insurance paying for snake oil in this story.
6971 2018-12-05 15:03:43 And make the oil barons rich

6973 2018-12-05 15:03:40 Smart leaders think about alternative sources of energy, idiots believe in coal and oil. But you cannot teach an old dog new tricks. Especially not when the old dog was too stupid to learn any tricks even when he was young.
6974 2018-12-05 15:03:32 No dog whistle in that comment nope
6975 2018-12-05 15:03:30 THE WORLD WANTS TO SEE, AND NEEDS, ALTERNATIVE ENERGIES TO COAL AND OIL!!!!!!!!!!

#TrumpTrain #MAGA #MTWGA #MakeTheWorldGreatAgain
6976 2018-12-05 15:03:23 Yes, lower oil prices will definitely cost people their jobs? I couldn't write this with a straight face
6977 2018-12-05 15:03:22 Just let Rodgers coach the team already

6979 2018-12-05 15:03:15 The world wants to see clean energy replace oil and coal. YOU want your buddy's dirty energy companies to profit at the expense of our health.
6980 2018-12-05 15:03:15 The game changer is you need to secure our border legalize marijuana in every state and it will stop the opiate problem immediately CBD oil for kids with ADHD and already get rid of the fucking chemicals that the pharmaceutical conglomerates make doctors and hospitals prescribe
6981 2018-12-05 15:03:14 If the President can't up and go to a concert in the 60s, what makes us think an extremely hated President can walk across the street to visit a very high profile person during a very high profile event?
6982 2018-12-05 15:03:12 West Texas Intermediate crude at $70 is a reasonable price. Please don’t push prices too much lower.  Domestic oil companies will keep active and also continue to have higher paying jobs.
6983 2018-12-05 15:03:11 Why is it ok for you to manipulate the free market by imposing tariffs but OPEC can't control supply?

If you want oil prices to drop, control demand by investing in green energy.
6984 2018-12-05 15:03:10 Because low oil prices hurts Russia who is currently threatening mid range ballistic missiles.  Its a way to get at Russia indirectly.  Their economy depends on high oil prices.
6985 2018-12-05 15:03:04 God i really, really, REALLY Want French toast sticks now
Fuck that motor oil post
6986 2018-12-05 15:03:03 are you trying to tell me that Arnold's tank doesn't run on magical good feelings and fairy dust!? The hell you say
6987 2018-12-05 15:03:00 Since the US is now the worlds largest oil exporter, why don’t you  order the US oil companies to keep more of it here to lower prices here instead of exporting. #Resign
6988 2018-12-05 15:02:58 Olip oil
6989 2018-12-05 15:02:54 Trump colliding to keep oil prices down.  Will he sue himself!!!
6990 2018-12-05 15:02:52 Melatonin and CBD oil candycanes for kids. Who’s with me?
6991 2018-12-05 15:02:52 Issa lie, I’m sure there are some leaves out there you could crush that could work just as well as any oil
6992 2018-12-05 15:02:50 Maybe we need to stop being slaves to an oil cartel.
6993 2018-12-05 15:02:46 What we need is to quit depending on other countries for oil.
6994 2018-12-05 15:02:41 Oil prices would be lower if you didn't unnecessarily pull out of the Iran deal, against the advice of our allies, who don't have an ocean separating them from Iran. They cut production but demand stayed the same, so the price increased; no wonder you went bankrupt 5 times.
6995 2018-12-05 15:02:41 There is a big game played by USA on oil  world will see in 2019 ..
6996 2018-12-05 15:02:40 Pure BS, Saddam invaded Kuwait which produces like 10% of the worlds oil.
6997 2018-12-05 15:02:39 How about investing in renewable energy sources so we are not so dependent on oil? It's time to change
6998 2018-12-05 15:02:31 Just see what is happening in Nigeria, Angola, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, Guinea, Gabon,  Libya  etc Crude oil have turn them madness, licence to kill their own people. even Crude Oil Price suppose to go down to  $20 US Dollars for people to be alive. I Support Trump.
6999 2018-12-05 15:02:16 Time to produce future technologies to become independent for Oil price ups and downs and finally get back to the World Wide market for selling products what the World economies needs! Gas Guzzling cars belongs to the 20th century! #ParisAgreement
7000 2018-12-05 15:02:15 On WSJ wires, via @kimmackrael: "The Bank of Canada held its benchmark interest rate steady at 1.75% on Wednesday as it warned that low prices for oil from the western province of Alberta could affect the pace of future rate increases"
7001 2018-12-05 15:02:14 realDonaldTrump How about we stop being so dependent on oil, and instead focus on wind, solar and hydro energy?

We could become the leaders in these technology and other nations would be dependent on us.

Instead you want to turn the clock back decades and depend on the res…
7002 2018-12-05 15:02:13 Trump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
7003 2018-12-05 15:02:13 The world does not want to need higher oil prices? What are you talking about?
7004 2018-12-05 15:02:12 Was supposed to get my oil changed 4000 miles ago ha. Whoops

7006 2018-12-05 15:02:10 Qatar has announced to withdraw from OPEC membership, it would be very difficult to predict about impact on oil prices across the Globe, Mr President you have destroyed entire Middle East, now you are asking them not to raise oil prices, These countries economy have destroyed

7010 2018-12-05 15:02:05 The world oil prices are primarily impacted by demand, if demand is not there oil supply will slow. Prices in the USA are about to rise and you are just making excuses in advance.

7018 2018-12-05 15:01:54 Yes, the world needs higher oil prices, high enough to make us realize their are better energy sources than oil.
7019 2018-12-05 15:01:53 Y’all. Please get some Rosehip Oil and elevate your skin game. My skin has never been this consistently clear.
7020 2018-12-05 15:01:52 Problem is market reaction is so unpredictable. Sometimes oil sells off on tweets like this, right now there's hardly any impact.
7021 2018-12-05 15:01:50 Trump u just lost this staunch trump supporters vote.  I am an oil investor.  U will also lose Texas/Oklahoma//North Dakota/New Mexico/Colorado if u keep up this anti oil zealotry!!!
7022 2018-12-05 15:01:44 Oil is still important today but yes I agree with you and your brother here
7023 2018-12-05 15:01:43 Hey don, the USA is still now the largest oil producing country.  Did ya know that?  Oil prices are falling.

7025 2018-12-05 15:01:38 One need ask the government specifically how it intends to replace the lost GDP from oil/gas. Its new economic plan falls short on increasing investment, is short-term through toying with depreciation schedules, & insufficient to address business investment declines since 2015.
7026 2018-12-05 15:01:37 We produce the most oil. Thanks to trump
7027 2018-12-05 15:01:34 Of course it is Scotland’s OIL and Whisky,, who else do u think owns it. Oil in our waters and Whisky made in our country. Only reason the union want to keep us as they would hate to lose the revenue from this. Get real!

7029 2018-12-05 15:01:28 Can they even produce enough green tech without oil & coal & natural gas?  Can they even make enough electricity in a green way to make metals & run all heavy machinery & heat all homes in cold areas?  Would you ban burning wood too?

7038 2018-12-05 15:01:12 The fracking industry would love to see OPEC raise prices. It would reassure existing infrastructure to proceed as planned lowering American gas prices and decreasing dependency on foreign oil.

Makes perfect sense! You are going to change the world...
7042 2018-12-05 15:00:53 That true I remember when PNP in power I use to say were these people get oil selling on the road in the garrison and in mobay

7050 2018-12-05 15:00:36 You go to the mechanic for a simple oil change and he ends up telling you about 15 other problems, now your car has 8 days to live 
7051 2018-12-05 15:00:36 Yes, easily manipulated, as would be the case with OPEC dropping production to drive up prices. It would drive up the price of Canadian oil as well.
7052 2018-12-05 15:00:34 Chuck Colson (Nixon's hatchet man) wrote an anecdote in his autobiography "Born Again" about how he once made a huge security breach by taking the President to a concert that he hadn't been scheduled to go to without getting everything secured beforehand.

7067 2018-12-05 15:00:07 Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
7068 2018-12-05 15:00:05 I thought Vlad and MBS were best friends of yours ... Which you can ask to go east on the oil price.

Their High Five at the G20 said it all. It screamed "Let's screw the orange Dotard with increasing oil prices,"
7069 2018-12-05 15:00:05 Yes 'hopefully' as in, "I have no direct control over what other countries do with their oil prices but I can influence them". Unless you want Trump with absolute power over foreign governments?
7070 2018-12-05 15:00:03 No, we need a stable price, and one that is about $70-$80/barrel, to keep all of the oilfield workers working and busy as well. At the price above gas prices are not out of hand, oil by products costs are not out of hand, & steady flow of $$ spent and taxes paid
7071 2018-12-05 15:00:03 Lower oil prices are NOT a trade off for dismembering a journalist. STOP PUSHING THIS NARRATIVE IT IS GROSS!
7072 2018-12-05 15:00:01 You know that record GDP growth you harp on about? A major driver of this is your O&G sector...decrease your oil prices and you’ll lose GDP digits (and bragging rights...actually, Obama has them already wrt O&G).
7073 2018-12-05 15:00:01 Rule of Thumb- change the oil every 5000 km or 3 months.
7074 2018-12-05 15:00:00 Yes but oil is a global commodity. A barrel of oil in Saudi Arabia costs the same as a barrel in Canada. Saudis can flood the market with supply because they have the means to do so.
7075 2018-12-05 15:00:00 But it was bad business for the oil gurus n companies ..u righty's are taking us to being controlled and defrauded n causes illness n death

You guessed it, it EXPLODES with so much force that the hot oil end's up all over the damn joint.
7078 2018-12-05 14:59:50 Telling Saudis to produce more oil doesn't sound very "America First"

you're right tho. everyone's gotta hustle. what these guys have however is closer to a racket IMHO. I'm by no means a fan

7081 2018-12-05 14:59:34 Don't worry, once you finish driving the US into a recession oil prices will continue to drop.
7082 2018-12-05 14:59:28 We have a habit of not doing that, like our idiot president pushing about foreign oil instead of focusing on industries we have more direct influence on.

7085 2018-12-05 14:59:22 Oil Prices in India started to fall after OPEC obliged to your order and decreased its export prices and also more supplies intact.
7086 2018-12-05 14:59:22 Remember opec countries depend on exporting oil. The more they fetch for their oil the better they can serve the needs of their people. Opec should cut production to stabilize price or produce more and watch shell production in USA starve.
7087 2018-12-05 14:59:21 Somebody should warn her to watch out for oil tankers.

7090 2018-12-05 14:58:59 I thought we were free of OPEC oil dependency and were exporting a lot ourselves ?  Due to fracking?
7091 2018-12-05 14:58:57 Palm oil is wiping out species, destroying pristine lands and clogging arteries.  I say ban the gunk right now!!

7100 2018-12-05 14:58:40 They told my husband they would give him anything. Morphine or or or or or..  
Dave just told them he'd like to use pot instead.
Looked to me for approval. But its his own pain. They are making capsules with CBD oil they use as a suppository. It is working
7101 2018-12-05 14:58:38 Iran prez hasan ruhani threatened USA during a rally that if Iranian oil export tries to get contain then Iran will block oil trade through gulf of Persia.
Since 1980,at various occasions threatened to choke it but they never done it.8 nations including India r allow to buy oil
7102 2018-12-05 14:58:36 US will be left behind when the time of oil comes to  the end.
7103 2018-12-05 14:58:34 The leftys were the ones who actually made gas cheaper because the oil companies had to compete against the clean energy
7104 2018-12-05 14:58:31 Snake oil salesman
7105 2018-12-05 14:58:30 Dear @mudfoods,
Just bought one of your pies. It has palm oil listed in the ingredients 
7106 2018-12-05 14:58:29 Hi Twitterverse! I'm looking for some great people to follow who work on governance, transparency, etc. in areas like oil, mining, hydro, nat gas and the like. Anyone have a good list?
7107 2018-12-05 14:58:29 If OPEC completely stopped oil production we’d only lose 11% of the oil we take in. If you invested in clean green energy, we would could eliminate any reliance on OPEC. That would create jobs, improve health, make us energy independent and by the way save the Earth.
7108 2018-12-05 14:58:28 Below $50 per barrel and U.S. frackers begin to scale back production. At $26.05 in February of 2016, oil and gas production was shuttered in the U.S. and industry layoffs were sizable. There is a happy medium!
7109 2018-12-05 14:58:27 Solar etc has its place, but how will farms til & plant & harvest without oil?  How can third world countries develop fast enough without oil & coal & natural gas?  A farmer friend installed a VERY expensive solar array and regrets.  Food prices can’t justify it after all.
7110 2018-12-05 14:58:19 Not once on my post did I defend Donald Trump.  My issue is with the snake oil salesmen and women in politics.  It has become for self and power rather than for people.
7111 2018-12-05 14:58:17 Yes but oil is a global commodity. A barrel of oil in Saudi Arabia costs the same as a barrel in Canada. Saudis can flood the market with supply because they have the means to do so.
7112 2018-12-05 14:58:15 아 나만 덕질 할 수 있는 나만의 덕캐가 있음 좋것다 하지만 자캐는 덕질의 대상이 아닌것 같고 앤캐란게 필요할때인가 근데 앤캐는 갖는 조건이 까다로와..또 곈캐는 진심으로 대할 수 없어
7113 2018-12-05 14:58:13 Exactly backward. Low oil prices are one of the proximate causes of our climate predicament.
7114 2018-12-05 14:58:09 Keep covering for the Saudi Prince and I’m sure the oil prices will stay low..anything for that oil.
7115 2018-12-05 14:58:08 Exactly my reply to WaPo. That, and so many celebs want him dead, how many underground nuts do too?
7116 2018-12-05 14:57:58 The EU has stated a lot of things—many of them (e.g.#CAP & #CFP) wrong..They don't like Poland's dirty coal or Italy's craxy finances. But if they were new applicants, things would be done to make it happen. As for oil, half is still there, to be sold at higher  (>$75/bl.) prices
7117 2018-12-05 14:57:55 unless you have oil stock
7118 2018-12-05 14:57:40 Actually, cheap oil hinders U.S. oil producers. Extracting oil in the U.S. only makes sense when a barrel sells for well over $50. Last Thursday, the price of crude oil fell under that. Can’t have your cake and eat it too when it comes to oil.
7119 2018-12-05 14:57:39 >Get ink / grease/ oil on hands
>Go to bathroom to wash them
>Running water makes me need a piss
>Have crap half measure piss I didn't actually need
>Wash hands again because just had a piss

I wouldn't mind, but this happens about 4 times a day.
7120 2018-12-05 14:57:36 Until you serve semo with groundnut oil
7121 2018-12-05 14:57:33 Looks like oil seeping lower after the initial bump higher
7122 2018-12-05 14:57:33 Hush. , Texas. RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
7123 2018-12-05 14:57:33 Took my car in for an oil change.  Had to leave it for another issue.  My (car) guys rented a vehicle for me, which is great.  I get to roll around town in a Dodge Caravan...a minivan, y’all...
7124 2018-12-05 14:57:31 I was wondering what the shale oil industry in the USA was thinking.  Thanks.
7125 2018-12-05 14:57:25 What if I use the rice internally? With soy sauce and chili oil? That oughta work.
7126 2018-12-05 14:57:21 The world doesn't need oil...
7127 2018-12-05 14:57:16 Ahnold stick to making shitty Terminator sequels, actually don't do that either, just don't do anything anymore.
7128 2018-12-05 14:57:15 Yes but our cost to produce a barrel is more expensive, especially for shale oil relative to foriegn countries which means if oil drops too low we may be producing for a loss.
7129 2018-12-05 14:57:12 Actually, higher oil prices is exactly what the world needs. You see, Donnie, the markets will naturally move to other resources, such as renewables, when oil becomes cost inefficient. But, Republicans dont believe in free markets anymore, do they? Only serving their oil masters.
7130 2018-12-05 14:57:04 And he drove a badass Hummer for years. What does he drive now, a Prius????
7131 2018-12-05 14:57:02 なぜ今日の夕飯がラーメンだとわかったのだ…
7132 2018-12-05 14:56:53 You’re going to use a bunch of electricity to pump water and whatever into an empty cavity?

I believe the Saudi’s current water split is 80/20, water/oil, on their effort.  It’s a short term solution, with a viciously steep production decline curve, later.
7133 2018-12-05 14:56:52 Never said he was highly functional 2nd pairing guy ;)
7134 2018-12-05 14:56:51 So what are you doing....sir you are snake oil fascinated! Remove thi head from thi a$$!
7135 2018-12-05 14:56:49 Aren't you suppose to be at HWBush's funeral right now? You decided not to hold a press conference when in Argentina out of respect to the Bush family--you words. Yet on THE day of the funeral you are tweeting about Oil prices??
7136 2018-12-05 14:56:49 On call, huh? Wonder how that looks on a resume.
7137 2018-12-05 14:56:49 Their GREED will not allow them to keep oil price law Sir. But we are in God’s provision and He is mightier than all.
7138 2018-12-05 14:56:44 CBD oil is like decaf THC. 
Been a long term user of medicinal cannabis(illegally), but had to quit due to a new job. 

It feels like CBD oil has given me all the healthy benefits I appreciate in weed without the debilitating high.
7139 2018-12-05 14:56:44 We drown to the dirty oil. Maybe we deserve it. RIP humanity
7140 2018-12-05 14:56:40 Stop high oil prices! Worlds does not need these abstract prices.
7141 2018-12-05 14:56:40 I hate Trump, but it doesn’t matter where we get our oil. Oil is a global commodity, and prices of oil extracted anywhere are set by demand, and the amount of oil extracted everywhere.
7142 2018-12-05 14:56:39 We need to work hard at getting off oil for many reason, but mostly for the planet.
7143 2018-12-05 14:56:27 Oklahoma City disagrees, we need high oil prices (but not too high).
7144 2018-12-05 14:56:23 So basically, Fowler is a dog pimp to Gallagher, and they use CBD oil as lube.
7145 2018-12-05 14:56:19 Just stick to bone saws and oil.  Thanks.
7146 2018-12-05 14:56:18 thanks mr President from Italy. A big gift for our  Country, big importer of oil.
7147 2018-12-05 14:56:15 Their all about the oil cause it's the petroleum dollar
7148 2018-12-05 14:56:15 Low oil prices devastate oil and gas jobs. Ask Rick Perry how many jobs were lost in Texas last time the Saudis decided to drive down the cost of oil.
7149 2018-12-05 14:56:13 @Sillywithsad that avi just made me reach for the coconut oil!!! 
7150 2018-12-05 14:56:11 The world doesn’t need anymore oil! Renewable energy is what we need and want!
7151 2018-12-05 14:56:05 #Oilers Come on guys....Talbs still wears the Oil drop....he's still a member of our team....and you know he wants to bounce back and play great tonight....BE FUCKING POSITIVE! #LetsGoOilers
7152 2018-12-05 14:56:01 No, moron. The world does not want to see more oil. It's exacerbating climate change. Stop the problem and invest in clean energy. Try and do something presidential for once, you tax-evading twidiot.
7153 2018-12-05 14:56:00 JUST IN: The President of the United States ponders what effect OPEC's possible future actions may affect oil prices for no apparent reason. Editorial Note: I saw gasoline for sale in Missouri for $1.91 recently. Why is President Dotard quaking in his boots about oil prices?...
7154 2018-12-05 14:55:54 If you are in the oilfiled, you want to see higher oil prices.
7155 2018-12-05 14:55:52 While @Rillllla is saving the world one solar panel at a time, I'm currently spending 25 hours a week selling heating oil  #energygirls
7156 2018-12-05 14:55:48 Why they hating for, most of these motherfuckers be basic too ... I’m talking bout welders, oil field, plant workers etc 
7157 2018-12-05 14:55:42 Why no tariff on oil imports?
7158 2018-12-05 14:55:35 Oil price suppose to be  $40 US Dollars or $30 US Dollars because those who have Crude oil is too much Corrupt, money is pushing many Countries to be Committing Genocide, Corruption, killing their own people unacessery. I Support President Trump, Western world should not allow it
7159 2018-12-05 14:55:34 Except Putin…who’s going to have to start selling fake Gucci bags to stay afloat if you can keep oil prices down. 

#EnergyIsFreedom
7160 2018-12-05 14:55:34 Is that your foreign trade policy? Hope?That, and covering up the murder of American residents? Why not get GM to make a car that runs on soybean oil, dickbrain, since there’s now such a surplus.
7161 2018-12-05 14:55:33 Seems you are not invested in oil companies. But may be you want to buy oil stocks with low prices.MAKE TRUMP RICH again.
7162 2018-12-05 14:55:28 ...ostensibly you could *also* be trying to raise the value of the USD, effectively lowering oil prices. But that makes you a responsible party to the issue so we all know this method is a non-starter.

Or maybe divesting the US from oil as much as possible and into renewables
7163 2018-12-05 14:55:27 Donald, Anthony's correct you get most of your oil from Canada. and Alberta cut production to boost prices. They're channeling your mantra. "Me first" So don't bitch about higher costs, after all we have to stop countries from ripping us off for so long.
7164 2018-12-05 14:55:25 Actually, the world does desparately need higher oil prices, as high cost is effectively the only motivation to stop destroying the earth with drilling and high-emissions vehicles. But hey, you don’t believe that White House report on global warming anyway, right?
7165 2018-12-05 14:55:22 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 21,40 ευρώ με άνοδο 1,42% όγκο 83 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 2,37 δισ. ευρώ
7166 2018-12-05 14:55:21 Rather than trying to tamp down the price of oil, why don't you embrace the reality of global warming. Embrace it and make it the top priority of your remaining days in office. Every day you can do a little something to help save our precious planet.
7167 2018-12-05 14:55:21 I've attended several of your rallies and a huge Trump fan. You was supported by the south because of oil drilling, but we cant compete or operate at low prices. For the first time ever, I'm begging you to stop preaching for low oil prices. Hope someone is listening
7168 2018-12-05 14:55:17 This case study examines how Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is moving forward to the Digital Transformation to increase its profitability, operational efficiency and competitiveness in the oil market, opened by the Energy Reform in Mexico. The findings are the result of a serie…
7169 2018-12-05 14:55:17 hahaha ang awkward ni Boss sabihin mo na kasing bet mo si Oil
7170 2018-12-05 14:55:15 OPEC, allies could cut oil output by reverting to 2016 quotas: TASS ... REUTERS #S_FX #Forex2018 December 05, 2018 at 02:55PM #ForexNovember
7171 2018-12-05 14:55:15 The World needs to use green energy. Wind and Solar are the future. Oil is the past. We need to invest in the future and stop pretending like coal and oil are going to be there for years and years to come.
7172 2018-12-05 14:55:13 The world does not need oil
7173 2018-12-05 14:55:12 F-ck you we want affordable oil. President doesn't stop working because another died sh-thead
7174 2018-12-05 14:55:12 Just the people who make a living providing oil in America
7175 2018-12-05 14:55:11 CBD oil is like decaf THC.
7176 2018-12-05 14:55:08 Donnie you do realize that OPEC has been lowering and raising oil prices for decades because of supply and demand. That determines wether or not they will raise oil prices. Why haven’t you mentioned the dow closing -800 points yesterday?
7177 2018-12-05 14:55:08 The world needs to replace oil.  It is going to run out.  Improve solar!
7178 2018-12-05 14:55:03 As if you care what we pay for gas and heating oil
7179 2018-12-05 14:54:50 しかし明智ジョーカーは名前呼び捨てなんで…はい…好かれてますね…知ってました…(再認
7180 2018-12-05 14:54:46 But because of low oil price Putin makes war with other countries. That's the reality about oil. Oil is a big mistake in history.
7181 2018-12-05 14:54:46 I can promise you, oil gas and coal companies would pay much more for Scientists to say climate change isn’t real. But that doesn’t work because scientists are usually in it for the discoveries and so oil gas and coal pay your politicians on the right to spread doubt.
7182 2018-12-05 14:54:45 Sure. Where are you located, and would you like to volunteer to organize it? We are doing similar where I’m from. ( heart of oil country ) shooting for Jan-feb once we get numbers and feed back. Any one else interested? Would be cool to have our voices heard nationwide
7183 2018-12-05 14:54:43 Anyone else who stopped using morocon oil find that their hair went through a freak out/shit stage? Or just me?
7184 2018-12-05 14:54:42 war for oil.

Destabilizing as heck.
7185 2018-12-05 14:54:39 Sarah Palin was right ‘Drill Baby Drill’ brought US to #1 in oil production. If she’d just answered ‘Dred Scott’ when the perky Katie Couric asked her what Supreme Court decision she disliked-She’d have been VP .
7186 2018-12-05 14:54:38 I'm so proud to live in a province where the premier is so powerful, that he controls the market price for oil on the world stage. 
Will you still be bragging when crude prices rise? 
Knobs.
7187 2018-12-05 14:54:34 @RosieBarton oh it has nothing to do with the Bloomberg dump of all their oil stocks! Global markets have all been hit by this.
7188 2018-12-05 14:54:32 Too much Palm Oil
7189 2018-12-05 14:54:31 Gw pake olive oil malah makin parah. Jadi jerawatan semuka2nya. Kayanya karena minyak
7190 2018-12-05 14:54:31 inom kang johnson's baby oil, Te. Hahahahaaha
7191 2018-12-05 14:54:29 Nurse! He got out again. OPEC hasn't controlled oil prices in decades.
7192 2018-12-05 14:54:27 Well duh! Low oil prices is good for the economy.. high oil prices causes inflationary crash.. except for the last 10 years. Lol
7193 2018-12-05 14:54:27 Snake oil salesman
7194 2018-12-05 14:54:25 Go screw yourself. Leave Oil alone. You have already fucked the markets enough!  What about your 800 market drop b/c markets don't believe your lies! These companies depend on oil to fund budgets and you just are screwing them over for your self interests. You have to go in 2020.
7195 2018-12-05 14:54:24 RT realDonaldTrump "Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!"
7196 2018-12-05 14:54:24 TRUMP SAYS 'HOPEFULLY OPEC WILL BE KEEPING OIL FLOWS AS IS, NOT RESTRICTED. THE WORLD DOES NOT WANT TO SEE, OR NEED, HIGHER OIL PRICES!'
7197 2018-12-05 14:54:22 Njugu, oil refill lazima before the weekend happens!
7198 2018-12-05 14:54:19 It is time for OPEC to dissolve and way beyond time for our nation to become independent from them when it comes to our oil
7199 2018-12-05 14:54:17 With low oil prices Nigeria is gonna be in deeper shit
7200 2018-12-05 14:54:13 How much oil did your MBS cover up buy us?
7201 2018-12-05 14:54:12 Quit it. The USA exports more oil in a week than OPEC drills in a year. We DON'T rely on #OPEC
7202 2018-12-05 14:54:08 Lower oil price lowerrrrcoal usage!! Wake up WV trumpy does not have your back!!!!!
7203 2018-12-05 14:54:06 Maybe he think oil is more important than Bush?
7204 2018-12-05 14:54:04 Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
7205 2018-12-05 14:54:03 You do realize that high prices is the only reason our oil shale/sands producers can afford to produce oil, don't you?  It's an expensive process.  If prices go too low, we won't be the world's largest producer anymore.
7206 2018-12-05 14:53:57 These are easy to make #vegan too.  I sprayed mine with olive oil spray and used a biscuit #veganrecipes.
7207 2018-12-05 14:53:54 Ya gotta figure , the higher oil goes the more attractive electric cars get; and they get their power from power plants that run on nat gas. way cheaper than oil.
7208 2018-12-05 14:53:52 Nationalism, NOT GLOBALISM REMEMBER! So support our Country's oil companies and quit importing
7209 2018-12-05 14:53:49 พึ่งเคยเห็น น่าเศร้าแต่ทำไมออกมาน่ารักนะ
7210 2018-12-05 14:53:46 I hope that OPEC of the flow is not restricted. The world wants to see, or need, the higher oil prices.
7211 2018-12-05 14:53:45 The oil barrels have feet apparently 
7212 2018-12-05 14:53:44 Lower oil from these gates will wipe out the US oil industry
7213 2018-12-05 14:53:44 Now oil price 53.50...see later will how much
7214 2018-12-05 14:53:43 I’m guessing you don’t refine any oil in Colorado.
7215 2018-12-05 14:53:42 TARIFF MAN WANT MORE OIL!
7216 2018-12-05 14:53:41 I work in the oil sands and I’m lucky. The culture and the camp I’m in really are as far from that as can be but a lot of that has to do with dry camps and  these big companies just not putting up with it anymore. In many ways the oil sands are in a bubble safety AND culture wise
7217 2018-12-05 14:53:41 does anyone know if i can keep the oil rendered from salmon overnight...?
7218 2018-12-05 14:53:35 بترول العرب "للعرب"
VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies are working toward a deal this week to reduce oil output by at least 1.3 million barrels per day, four sources said, adding that Russia’s resistance to a major cut was so far the main stumbling block.
7219 2018-12-05 14:53:35 Putin and MBS made their own oil/OPEC agreement. You’re out of it since they no longer need you for their political or financial agendas.
7220 2018-12-05 14:53:33 Ask our domestic oil producers about the low prices. More people out of work.
7221 2018-12-05 14:53:30 — So let use off be octo while oil bike the bil and wheel whang till wabblin befoul you but mere and mire trullopes will knaver mate a game
7222 2018-12-05 14:53:28 Lower oil from these gates will wipe out the US oil industry
7223 2018-12-05 14:53:27 Kill all the Americans you want,  just keep the oil flowing. 
Sounds like this could be made into a song.
7224 2018-12-05 14:53:27 Yes we do but the Our leaders know the consequences of drilling into our land....It destroys it!! They rather invade other countries take their oil and destroy their land!!
7225 2018-12-05 14:53:24 WWWWHHHHHATTTTT you mean you arent taking credit for oil prices being low and subsequently gas prices... Well my word someone with intelligence has stolen Trumps phone, and its obviously not Kellyanne Conway..
7226 2018-12-05 14:53:20 The Democrats told us that the president has nothing to do with oil prices when Obama was president.Did they lied to us?

7228 2018-12-05 14:53:19 Sorry Dr sb. But current increase in fares is not due to rise in export bill. Oil prices are on the fall. This week govt announced decrease in fuel prices. If fuel price has decreased for railways how  can it justify fare increase?
7229 2018-12-05 14:53:18 Hey Liza, I like to rub CBD oil over my body. Is this what it’s meant for? My skin feels shinier and oilier, like a fish.
7230 2018-12-05 14:53:17 castor oil has SAVED my brows
7231 2018-12-05 14:53:14 I thought we were self sufficient with oil. We are still dependent on OPEC?
7232 2018-12-05 14:53:13 Please explain why rUK would stop trading with independent Scotland? Would they stop needing oil and oil derivative products? Would they stop needing the food and drink we provide them or the electricity and gas? And finally can you prove that is the value of our trade with rUK
7233 2018-12-05 14:53:12 Gee if we were fueling our vehicles on Hydrogen we wouldn't have to worry about the price of oil . They could keep it and all the sand that sits on top of it !
7234 2018-12-05 14:53:06 Blood & Oil. We know which one you care most.
7235 2018-12-05 14:53:04 We need small safe nuclear reactors to generate electricity in each city.   Grid independence oil independence
7236 2018-12-05 14:53:04 Does “the world” include enemies that want to use oil as a political weapon?  Hmmmm...
7237 2018-12-05 14:53:03 Hopefully Solar Energy will get rid of Oil Production in the future. What a waste
7238 2018-12-05 14:53:01 What we need is clean energy. And again, coal is not clean nor is oil.

7240 2018-12-05 14:52:58 We actually need to use less oil and more renewable energy. It's because of the environment you see.
7241 2018-12-05 14:52:58 Whoa there Trumpy - better ask those that get that oil lobby $$$$$$$$$ your boy @JohnCornyn & Lying @tedcruz ... we Texans are not so much for real low oil prices... You being from NY would not really understand that.
7242 2018-12-05 14:52:58 Because lower oil prices are much more important than a Virginia resident, seeking a marriage license, being dismembered by a bone saw.
7243 2018-12-05 14:52:55 Kim speaks the truth. Donald has everyone snowed into thinking the Saudi's are vital to the US in regards to oil. Canada supplies 40% of all your oil. Saudi supplies 11%. They are not that vital.
7244 2018-12-05 14:52:53 No more tweets - America not interested in oil today - please show respect - calm please -
7245 2018-12-05 14:52:48 Really??   He is in process of taking away all their subsidies but leaving coal, oil and ethanol subsidies in place.   Thats not helping green energy at all.
7246 2018-12-05 14:52:48 Was going to oil the fence; too windy. Chop wood; too dark. Making a fruit cake.
7247 2018-12-05 14:52:43 Electric power is important not oil.
7248 2018-12-05 14:52:40 Slowly rising oil and other fossil fuel prices spur technological advances that are better for the environment. 
Ending electric car subsidies is counter productive.

7251 2018-12-05 14:52:37 We should not have to depend on foreign oil. America never learns. We will be their puppet until we are energy independent.
7252 2018-12-05 14:52:33 "Oil flows"? Is it Dotardian language?
7253 2018-12-05 14:52:31 R Shimon- for baked menachot oil is smeared on top of loaves and remainder of oil given to kohanim.
7254 2018-12-05 14:52:30 Donald, you showed the world 'weakness' and OPEC, Russia, NK, and others will try and take advantage. When the leader of OPEC and Putin--large oil producer-- greet each other with hugs low oil prices are in trouble. Just before Christmas...not a good present for US(A).

7258 2018-12-05 14:52:24 It's difficult for them now to shadow their Egos... I have heard they are performing puja for increasing oil price, drought, big HRA n MSP hike which influence inflation.. Real rate of interest is too high these days... Govt must save it.... It is tax payer whose portion is this
7259 2018-12-05 14:52:18 Well trump! YOU need to talk to Iran and see if the Paris Accord will let you back in on the cheap.
IF OPEC increase oil prices you can always revert to clean shiny coal! 
Steam is clean and effective, clean coal makes lots of clean steam. 
7260 2018-12-05 14:52:17 I am not a crook! Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
7261 2018-12-05 14:52:17 The French aren't pissed about Oil, they're pissed they're stuck with a Globalist puppet flooding their Country with migrant leeches & selling out their sovereignty.
7262 2018-12-05 14:52:15 What we NEED is clean energy. If we put half the amount of money that we use in oil into green energies, we could easily reduce our impact on climate change. But why would you care? your friends in Saudi Arabia are happy and apparently thats all that matters

7265 2018-12-05 14:52:14 Don't we get most of our oil from Canada and Latin America?
7266 2018-12-05 14:52:13 Actually the opposite is true. We need more expensive oil so that renewable sources become a better choice.
7267 2018-12-05 14:52:12 Let's work on not being dependent on oil.
7268 2018-12-05 14:52:10 The USA does not need OPECs oil, we have enough right here in the USA

7273 2018-12-05 14:52:03 OPEC is an influential part of The World and wants higher oil prices. You, having been bending over backwards to act in the interests of OPEC head honcho Saudi Arabia, thereby also want higher oil prices.
7274 2018-12-05 14:52:01 Just saw and older woman from my work walk outside on her break and take a rip of her oil pen seconds outside of the doors and it was a whole fucking mood

7276 2018-12-05 14:51:51 that is obscene
7277 2018-12-05 14:51:49 Or oil from MBS for murder  !
I would rather pay more for gas !
7278 2018-12-05 14:51:49 But we also don't need more potential for oil spills or the over-extraction of none renewable resources. If not for climate change which I know you don't believe in, think of it as a business investment. Low resources, higher prices vs never ending resources and low prices.
7279 2018-12-05 14:51:46 One of the difficulties here: the article indicates that most of the growth is in oil field equipment, the load class with probably the highest participation rate in DR programs. It seems possible a lot of it will come off the system before rolling blackouts are needed.

7288 2018-12-05 14:51:30 Sure – OPEC countries will want to squander the only economic strategy they have (supply/price manipulation), because we want lower oil prices. These are often countries will little else contributing to GDP. What's their motivation to keep oil prices low? Electric car market?

7394 2018-12-05 14:48:52 an actual president, one who was a true leader and not a bloviating rodeo clown with an infant's understanding of the world, might actually have some idea of how to affect real change in oil prices. but keep up the tweeting, America's Demented Grandpa, it's what you're good at
7395 2018-12-05 14:48:52 Especially since you screwed up the markets already. Can you imagine higher oil, and China calling in bonds.
7396 2018-12-05 14:48:51 Exectly because restriction of oil flows increase the Globally inflation rate.
7397 2018-12-05 14:48:45 just by switching from bunker fuel to light oil or nat gas they will make huge advances
7398 2018-12-05 14:48:45 Wrong. Exporting countries that primarily rely on oil exports... are collapsing from the glut. Not to mention these low prices just keep demand high for uber polluting big vehicles.

7405 2018-12-05 14:48:39 Actually the world does need oil to be higher. Oil prices feed businesses in the US economy which supports the declining stock market and keeps companies from closing down production of small cars but you are not smart enough to grasp that. You went to business school?

7412 2018-12-05 14:48:34 Thank you, Mr. President, for speaking out against high oil prices and helping to drive the price down.

We are all driving our cars with cheaper gasoline and heating our homes (in this very cold fall season despite the global warming hoax) with less expensive heating oil.

7515 2018-12-05 14:46:19 Just add an oil tariff.  That'll keep prices down.

7524 2018-12-05 14:46:13 The US is now the top producer of oil.  It’s up to us, not OPEC.  Members are leaving OPEC.
7525 2018-12-05 14:46:11 Are you familiar with North Dakota, Texas, and Alaska?  They're probably cool with higher oil prices.
7526 2018-12-05 14:46:09 The norwegian economy is highly based on weapon sales, oil and fish. This is not the same as in Denmark. Please argue with a little bit of factuality involved at least.

7645 2018-12-05 14:37:59 Pure grapeseed oil is the best thing I've found for lip hydration. 
Get some oil and sugar and make a small amount of paste. Rub it in gentle circles on your lips to remove the dry skin then wipe away with a washcloth (exfoliation). Then apply oil every night to stay nice.

7651 2018-12-05 14:37:15 The Russians lost over 8 million military defeating Hitler. The US lost just over 400,000 in the entirety of WWII.

The Saudis supply 11% of our oil supply and turned a blind eye to the 9/11 hijackers. Why do we need to compromise our ideals for them?

7654 2018-12-05 14:37:03 Everyone thinks I'm a moron to have a negative Delta collar trade on oil over the OPEC meeting. Let's see if they're right.
7655 2018-12-05 14:36:51 No more than 6 fries, huh?  This makes me think of the idea of homemade fries - a batch of 36 or even 60 - fried in olive oil, which is high in HDLs - the good cholesterol.
7656 2018-12-05 14:36:37 are you able to re-map $oil? so $54.2 and then retrace? Thx in advance!

7661 2018-12-05 14:36:13 In all honesty, the teams most likely to pull away are the ones in their division. Don't like Oilers chances of finishing ahead of Calgary, San Jose or Vegas.
7662 2018-12-05 14:36:09 The struggle is real!
7663 2018-12-05 14:36:05 No we have every Wednesday and Friday plus Easter and christmas plus couple others throughout the yr. If you do it properly its supposed to be no dairy, oil and meat but i can only do no meat as im bad tempered and that defeats the point

7667 2018-12-05 14:35:41 I agree we need to get off fossil fuel. We also should be talking about consumers pushing to get incentives for converting to electronic cars as well as incentives for solar power and incentives for battery storage. Just saying no big oil isn’t enough. What do we do to convert?
7668 2018-12-05 14:35:39 It's 7:30, and 25 degrees outside. I have to be at work at 9. Hopefully by then the weather will have warmed up to at least "at freezing", 32 degrees...

7681 2018-12-05 14:34:01 I have heard similar stats before on the eye-popping contribution of shipping to global air pollution, so I can well believe it. It is due to burning enormous quantities of heavy, sulphurous oil.

7691 2018-12-05 14:33:16 Ya they all matter. Inter-divisional are pivotal, but Oilers gotta pickup PTS against everyone to get into playoffs. 4-2-1 under Hitchcock is a nice start, but they’ve gotta maintain a strong pace the rest of the way to narrow that gap before some of these teams really pull away

7693 2018-12-05 14:33:09 Bond yields are falling because inflation expectations are falling and they are falling because #oil is down. The bottom of inflation expectations (breakevens) in 2016 was same as the bottom for oil. If you get oil and #USD  right, you can get a lot of other things correct.

7719 2018-12-05 14:30:58 use a moisturizer ( key to keeping oil production under control ) 

use a toner ; witch hazel is a good option ( regulate your skin oil production)

on days where you’re just a little oily ; use a blotting paper or touch up with some pressed makeup powder

7762 2018-12-05 14:26:51 We also import palm oil from Malaysia to manufacture ghee and solvents. These are manufactured here and widely consumed by everyday citizens. Prices have risen and will continue to rise on basic items like this. Expect a jump in inflation level

7780 2018-12-05 14:24:59 Seriously we need to burn our own oil across Canada! We need ports to ship it overseas! We need equal representation across Canada! If the hypocritical and subjective practises are not dealt with! Canada is doomed!

7783 2018-12-05 14:24:52 You clearly do as you are crying about it. Our brand is just growing, thank you! I guess you can tell your parents to stop filling their car with oil too!
7784 2018-12-05 14:24:52 Guerrilla warfare. Unnecessary elephants. A guy wielding a giant hammer. Magical oil that seems like normal oil.

Are we sure that Hanukkah isn't a #dnd one shot?
7785 2018-12-05 14:24:43 That last photo says so much in itself. The Barcelona accord of '73 led to the Resolution of Strasburg in '75 thru the EAD; seems imperative it be reconsidered. It's not a good deal for Western countries. Perhaps reliance on Middle Eastern oil needs reduced for any good change.

7791 2018-12-05 14:24:12 Personally I can't believe these businesses aren't being fined out of existence. There are also oil drums, gas canisters, and for some bizarre reason the lower torso of a female mannequin.
7792 2018-12-05 14:24:04 yes underlining issue is union strength, its killing the train systems flexability, nothing wrong with higher fuel prices, its all other stuff, oil is just an easy way to rile a group up, as its so simple
7793 2018-12-05 14:24:03 Essential oils are #FragrantOils extracted from plants chiefly through steam distillation (eucalyptus oil) or expression (grapefruit oil)

7802 2018-12-05 14:23:08 Je crois vraiment que le pire cela a été quand Philippe a expliqué qu'ils augmentent le gaz oil pour que les gens se rendent compte de l'écologie. Un tel mépris a été beaucoup beaucoup trop. Et ceux qui se taisaient depuis longtemps se sont levés.
7803 2018-12-05 14:23:06 Last day off before I start my new job! Gotta get an oil change, make some dr appts, play some fallout, finish orders, and bask in the knowledge that I'll be learning a new skill within my field  at a new company tomorrow :)

7805 2018-12-05 14:22:47 @CBCEyeopener Deb Yedlin referred this morning to BC acting on reducing emissions from the oil and gas sector, while ignoring emissions from the transportation sector.  She must have missed the story about the proposed banning of internal combustion engines in Vancouver by 2040!
7806 2018-12-05 14:22:47 Obama forced #WindEnergy on @ndgov using it as a trade for the pipeline. Obama screwed us and still didn't approve the pipeline. Our feckless "Leader's" sold out, agreed to preach wind being a positive, in exchange for a pipeline. How did that work? #NDPOL #oil #NuclearEnergy
7807 2018-12-05 14:22:33 That's great, minister, looking forward to hearing the details. Lots can be done  immediately, e.g. no expansion of Dub. airport, no oil/gas exploration, a cessation of the massive road building schemes outlined in Ireland 2040, and revision of that plan to climate-proof.

7821 2018-12-05 14:21:08 A responsible government would have a plan for converting a number of these power plants to natural gas or propane. A fossil fuel, I realize, but it is much cleaner burning than coal or crude oil burning power plants.

7854 2018-12-05 14:18:06 When people continue to equate the 'energy industry' to fossil fuels, it is obvious they just don't get it.  Her 100Mt 'cap' on oil sands emissions is an *increase*; our national 2030 carbon budget for 1.5 is about 385Mt.
7855 2018-12-05 14:18:02 Rose hip oil has a notoriously short shelf life if it isn't bolstered with an antioxidant. It *will* smell lightly fishy when fresh, but if yours is smelling really strong, pitch it & get a fresh bottle (keep it in the fridge to extend the shelf life). <3

7908 2018-12-05 14:12:21 Why are you so obsessed with an industry that is in its decline? The world is moving forward away from dirty oil, coal etc. Neanderthal politicians are the only ones hanging on with their nails to this 19th Century mentality.

7916 2018-12-05 14:11:34 Cllr King says 3.5% of the total portfolio is directly invested in oil & gas companies & a further £60m invested in diversified mining companies. Around half of revenue from these mining companies comes from fossil fuels.
7917 2018-12-05 14:11:34 so many white women tell me they don’t use any moisturizer or oil on their face im like ?? this is why y’all age fast duh
7918 2018-12-05 14:11:25 Sorry you're disappointed, Alison. We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks for the feedback - Melissa

7931 2018-12-05 14:09:44 Indonesia is clearing jungle land to grow palm oil for bio fuel to get off off coal.

It's not just Trump.

7933 2018-12-05 14:09:35 George H.W. Bush is the most misunderstood modern president. Conservatives blamed him for raising taxes, ignoring the role of Congress and the need to compromise, and liberals saw the Gulf War as merely an oil war, ignoring the restraint in Bush's decision not to enter Bagdad.
7934 2018-12-05 14:09:30 Change doesn't happen overnight.   So, you agree that when Sparky McFartyPants said "We have the bestest cleanest air and water." it was due to when we actually had an EPA dependant of Big Oil.  #ThanksObama

7941 2018-12-05 14:08:50 I am not saying socialism works, I am saying it’s tough to use a quote from 11 about a country whose economy was balanced on such a volatile product like oil. Was it really socialism to blame or the Capitalist nature of the government? Both you say? Yes i agree

7951 2018-12-05 14:07:31 The day after Notley's announcement, the price of Western Canadian Select heavy oil jumped $8.02 to $29.95 US a barrel.
7952 2018-12-05 14:07:16 Not as wild as 600k barrel of oil unaccounted for
7953 2018-12-05 14:07:15 No mineral, including oil, will ever be exhausted. If and when the cost of finding and extraction goes above the price consumers are willing to pay, the industry will begin to disappear.
7954 2018-12-05 14:07:11 All the more reason for Alberta to leave Canada and connect to the American pipeline system to sell oil....
7955 2018-12-05 14:07:11 I believe all countries have the right to turn bushland into productive agricultural land, whilst protecting species diversity. Why not object to what is happening in your own country, or reduce your own fossil fuel use? More palm oil means local jobs, may mean less fossil fuel.

2. If you're saying this while being American, than you don't support the creation of this nation
3. Children can't have opinions?
7978 2018-12-05 14:04:41 There is, which is why the "only the Pacific Division games matter" narrative so many Oilers fans take is ridiculous.
7979 2018-12-05 14:04:40 I thought you said a “report” which implies a technically researched source of data. Instead you present toilet paper from “Union of Concerned Scientists”. Would you accept a report disavowing climate change if it was funded by big oil?
7980 2018-12-05 14:04:39 Yow... 600k barrel of oil, that's just... wow.
7981 2018-12-05 14:04:37 It passes my time discussing it with someone that has a opposite viewpoint and does not go batshit crazy when discussing. They just keep stating I've been drinking more snake oil lol. But sooner or later the cats going to be out of the bag either way.

8006 2018-12-05 14:02:25 The real ways you can pay Nigerian back like some country who has oil like us, is to be sharing monthly allocation into four instead of three, the 25℅ of the money should be sharing to Nigerian people every month,  Lobatan.

8122 2018-12-05 13:52:28 Most Canadians do strongly align themselves with the oil and gas sector: they drive cars less fuel-efficient than they need, heat their homes with oil or natural gas, and don’t seem interested in the only real alternative: nuclear.
8123 2018-12-05 13:52:24 The thing is, a lot of people simply need to use gasoline to get around, and while that remains true, raising prices will only further shift wealth from regular people to the oil companies.

8150 2018-12-05 13:50:31 C'mon.  We can't afford subsidies for regular citizens.  We have to pay for billionaire tax cuts, big oil subsidies, .and our military industrial complex.
8151 2018-12-05 13:50:25 "restart" because prices of oil and soybeans are lower in the US now. It's just a good deal for them and they're going back towards normal. You achieved nothing the US didn't have last year
8152 2018-12-05 13:50:21 You want clean air and water yet you push for oil and coal. How do those two things work together in accomplishing your goal? Your goal is to line your pocket with money, that's how.
8153 2018-12-05 13:50:02 Ok I’m gonna look for that. Evening primrose oil is good too for inflammation. I’m trying to stop taking ibuprofen so much.
8154 2018-12-05 13:49:53 Are you going to shut down the US and China economies because that’s what it would take to address your “climate emergency”

8180 2018-12-05 13:48:09 This is another thing. The government made this oil crisis. All for the pip line. You all notes there was no crisis till they bot that dam pip line. Why is it you won't to ship to the other side of the world. But yet eastern Canada gets millions a month sent  from the other side.
8181 2018-12-05 13:48:08 do you realize that every time I use the term "reduce" that your response insists that oil "replacement " is impossible? 

reduce is different than replace. I'm certain you know that yet you continually overlook and re-frame the focus back on oil "replacement" 
Why do u do that?

Do they stand firm when it comes to politicians on their side when they are paid by lobbyists? Or "scientists" funded by oil/gas/special interest groups?

8223 2018-12-05 13:43:52 You're conflating Big Oil, that misleads about climate change for continued profit, with Beto that worked with largest employer in his area. Attack Big Oil for what it does, fine, but doing it vicariously via political attacks on Beto is a stretch.

8236 2018-12-05 13:42:27 Big Fracking Profits at $50 a Barrel? Don’t Bet on It

Dec.4 (Dow Jones) -- The rapid decline of U.S. oil prices will test the claim of fracking companies that they can now prosper at $50 a barrel or less, a price level they have found challenging in the past.
8237 2018-12-05 13:42:22 Possibly, but it has been inconsistent on English. 
Japan does a straight up 3000 coin 1000 oil regardless of time it took and I thought English copied it until what seems to be last month.

We could reduce energy bills by 1/3 if we dropped the nonsense. We can filter almost all other gases. CO2 is the gas of life. The ecosystems life.
8262 2018-12-05 13:39:29 Нет, не знаю
8263 2018-12-05 13:39:29 At what point do our politicians start addressing the fact that carrying on business as usual and not trying to make any kind of arrangements with where we buy oil from is part of this. And what about the other states that have the squeeze on Tesla so they can't even sell there.

8272 2018-12-05 13:38:35 Hear me:
You haven't named a viable replacement for oil yet.

With the exception of a very, very small portion, oil is irreplaceable. (electricity - yes, replaced with CH4 would be great).

Also:
Solar power on a large scale is a joke - polluting, expensive, intermittent.

8298 2018-12-05 13:36:06 I'm glad the @bankofcanada knows that there is an oil crisis here in this country. That's because there our financial numbers involved. Our Prime Minister might have a better sense too, but @instagram isn't used for showing numbers.....#Alberta @RachelNotley @jkenney

8306 2018-12-05 13:35:12 I love Hannukah. It's more than just oil lasting for 8 days. It is about a small group standing up & saying we are Jewish. We will not assimilate. I encourage every type of Jew to embrace your Jewishness. In the words of Danny Pearl, "I AM JEWISH "!.
8307 2018-12-05 13:35:08 Most significant lately is increased opposition locally. Just a few weeks back the regional branch of the Labour party (Norway's largest and traditionally closely linked to the oil industry) went from 'yes' to 'no' on drilling in a fragile area.

8311 2018-12-05 13:34:31 Seriously stop trolling the Royals. At least the UK accepts climate change exists and are trying to do something about it. Your president doesn’t. He pulled out of the Paris agreement and wants to burn more coal and oil rather than invest in renewable energies.
8312 2018-12-05 13:34:21 Did you use olive oil
8313 2018-12-05 13:34:16 Yes, Carl's more of a conspiracy theorist than a skeptic. In the USA, we are sending those guys to prison -- see the sad case of Dr. Jerome Corsi, who claims that climate change is a hoax and oil is infinite, and those aren't even his felonies :)
8314 2018-12-05 13:33:51 Hari ni juga saya jadi personal shopper untuk my friend who’s taking fine arts. Beli oil paints, art supplies. Titanium white, zinc white, vivid white, lemon yellow, oil dryer, water mixable oil? Apa tu semua omagash I hope bought the right ones
8315 2018-12-05 13:33:47 India must be open on gas/oil pipeline cargo rail from Bangladesh to nepal. What is the reason behind not allowing nepal to use 25 km strip to access Bangladesh? Nepal is using inefficient calcutta port. How foreign trade can grows with unreliable delay prone port?
8316 2018-12-05 13:33:45 That’s not responsive to the factual points made. We get it that you fanboy for Beto. That’s not important. This is: He’s influenced by big oil. That’s reality.
8317 2018-12-05 13:33:40 I need to change my oil before I begin my drive to Key West in 2 weeks. I have everything I need to do it myself, but I'm probably going to just have a shop do it because it's so cold outside x.x
8318 2018-12-05 13:33:38 なるほど、王様繋がりでありそうですね
8319 2018-12-05 13:33:28 No sai Inga kamar dukawa yayi don karanta wani rubutu a wajen.
8320 2018-12-05 13:33:18 You can and should, you stand not for the Jewish community, you stand as a solider for Saudi Ariba oil and riches for your POTUS. You care not about the Jewish community, just another sad and lame photo-shot, placating your district. You are gone soon, may be sitting in jail
8321 2018-12-05 13:33:09 I suggest you post ED and prices of bread,cooking oil,rice,mazoe,eggs,flour and Mugabe with the same comparison
8322 2018-12-05 13:32:59 ปกติไม่เคยมีความอดทนรอคิวร้านอาหารนานๆ แต่ทำไมนี่ต้องมาอยากกินเอมเคในวันพ่อ งงตัวเอง
8323 2018-12-05 13:32:43 You didn’t address my question. You are avoiding it. Don’t deflect into another direction. It’s just like palm oil needs are destroying a forest in other places. Focus on what I asked, that the rise in consumption of soy beans has caused environmental problems.
8324 2018-12-05 13:32:38 mang inasal na walang chicken oil??? scammaz ampotaaa
8325 2018-12-05 13:32:37 , God bless you @mrmartinbath  there is more to our land than War,oil and corruption.
8326 2018-12-05 13:32:27 mana mahal banget lagi bio oil tuh HAHAHAH
8327 2018-12-05 13:32:25 “I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving America’s environment.” Says the man who’s actions are the complete opposite. Trump, you sold America out to special interests, big oil and gas. Reversed all regulations protecting our air and water
8328 2018-12-05 13:32:15 The donations are from people who work in oil and gas industry, not just the CEO. I can't believe people are racing your nonsense.
8329 2018-12-05 13:32:06 Thank you
8330 2018-12-05 13:31:58 Do they contain palm oil?
8331 2018-12-05 13:31:56 私もそれ、思ってました。でも、出るなら相棒自体が終わる本当の最終回になるのではとも思っていたので少し怖いですw
8332 2018-12-05 13:31:54 E liquid, gummies, beard oil, tattoo balm, capsules! Thanks for the chance!!
@tiffbryson
8333 2018-12-05 13:31:53 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
8334 2018-12-05 13:31:51 aku rasa kena start ambik vitamin c & fish oil balik la. Cepat sangat sakit & semput & penat skrg. Penat sampai menggigil!
8335 2018-12-05 13:31:40 Nigeria loses about US$3bn annually to illegal export of gemstones such as emerald, sapphire, ruby &topaz, which if tapped, refined and exported should be a positive for the mining &quarrying sector &consequently GDP performance. 

Only if MNCs are in Nigeria like the oil coys!
8336 2018-12-05 13:31:39 あ、なんか出て来るたびTLで叩かれる人たちだ！
8337 2018-12-05 13:31:38 Maybe start to work on the Alberta national crisis on the non export of the Canadian oil
8338 2018-12-05 13:31:37 Sir, may I ask why many of his Cabinet members feel they can fleece taxpayers? Are aligned with the Sister Oil companies and do their bidding?  He is selling FEDERAL LANDS? Wants to drill for oil off the coasts!!! This is NOT what we want.
8339 2018-12-05 13:31:32 Yes they do that’s why they keep up their gender equality and feminism bullsh*t hypocrisy even tho they still do business with Saudi Arabia for dirty oil and evil  Iran regime to help Bombardier
8340 2018-12-05 13:31:29 Great news @realDonaldTrump!  This indeed will give our farmers and oil production the boost they need.  
8341 2018-12-05 13:31:28 Garlic Shrimps and lemon eme in olive oil. Experiment ko lng yan pero naging mabili. Hahaha.
8342 2018-12-05 13:31:22 oil is old news for Rivers State, we have to work towards a more industrialized rivers state. #Goodgovernance #Allison2019
8343 2018-12-05 13:31:10 Mention Bush oil rig off the coast of Florida right before the bay of Pigs?
8344 2018-12-05 13:31:09 Yo all girls listen up rn. Get an oil change. Thank me later
8345 2018-12-05 13:31:04 It's not "Big Oil" as in oil companies/PACs, every individual that donated had to say what their job was, and in TEXAS a lot of the jobs that people worked at were in the oil industry. That's rather obvious, and not honest the way it's been characterized.
8346 2018-12-05 13:31:01 Running away from the Indian oil gas station after seeing the prices. No graçias.
8347 2018-12-05 13:30:58 Play smart. reduce GST on necessities Oil, Flour, Rice, Pulses, etc Open Brick klins, control cement prices ( wrong decisions have increased construction cost n stopped construction)
increase GST on luxuries n import above specific price. @Asad_Umar @imran_sidra
8348 2018-12-05 13:30:52 See wife materials everywhere
8349 2018-12-05 13:30:40 Instead of buying a pipeline that may never be built, would it not have been better to invest in our existing refineries and upgrade them to be able to refine our select oil.
8350 2018-12-05 13:30:29 And so far, the only reason I've heard about the NC case is because @sistertoldjah brought it up and is keeping on the story.
8351 2018-12-05 13:30:23 Has happened before, on a smaller scale. Give them time. Also, Tullow oil is transported from Lodwar through Eldoret to Mombasa. Best bet.
8352 2018-12-05 13:30:17 Well done.  Afghanistan has a lot of mineral resources but, oil isn't one of those.
8353 2018-12-05 13:30:02 I disagree.....Everyone has accepted that shale is here to stay...Now they are just hoping that low oil prices starts to increase demand every year and that depletion finally starts to hit the shale.
8354 2018-12-05 13:29:59 my cakes are weird - i don't measure anything, just using my eye. but roughly, a cup each of chopped figs, ground almonds, veg oil, agave syrup, baking powder, salt and 3 eggs - in blender.bake with figs on top at 170 for 30 - 40 mins.  then drizzle with PX sherry and lime juice.
8355 2018-12-05 13:29:51 なんにせよ来週楽しみですねぇ。

8361 2018-12-05 13:29:21 One year I complained about having to pay like $2k in oil heat even though we were still freezing since we never had the heat past 17 degrees and he had the nerve to complain about his unnecessary heating expenses to me as if they were the same

8365 2018-12-05 13:28:46 Who surprised? We lost a beach of sand all now  RT @mikey_esquire: Petrojam, Jamaica's oil refinery, cannot account for 600 barrels of oil. 

They cannot find it.

They do not know where it has vanished.

They are playing "Where's Waldo?" with 600 barrels of oil. 

LMFAO.
8366 2018-12-05 13:28:42 217,000 highway miles. 4.0 V-6 Synthetic oil since day one. New tires and more. 5 speed manual. Dealership maintained. ( Workplace )

8371 2018-12-05 13:28:34 High pressure liquid injection beneath the impermeable layer and into fossil fuel bearing rock. It’s extremely labour intensive & requires a great deal of skill and application. 

I bloody love science.
8372 2018-12-05 13:28:19 In capitalist America we have none of this fancy student support we pay for our own college and catch our own fish from icey river and hunt our own meat with nothing but flimsy disposable knife. We need no one well except disposable knife manufacturers longing king oil!
8373 2018-12-05 13:28:15 Where's your supermarket chain?
Where's your airline? 
Where's your private hospital?
Where's your oil refinery?
Where's your mine?
Where's your listed company?

And you call yourself FREE?
8374 2018-12-05 13:27:59 This is a very negative take on 'Nigeria country profile'. There is more to Nigeria than war, oil and corruption.
8375 2018-12-05 13:27:52 Ah, a darkness therefore Soulslike.
8376 2018-12-05 13:27:49 Wtf!! About time to just give up on these studies. One day it’s veggies are good for you, next day it’s they are no so good. Same thing with coconut oil, soy milk, cows milk etc etc.

8379 2018-12-05 13:27:28 We’ve been using theninsider since the kid was 7. So happy to see so many people on here using it. There so much snake oil out there it’s refreshing to see that a tool like this has value to so many.
8380 2018-12-05 13:27:28 Lmao yes there you go. Why all this work to get oil to the other side of the world. When eastern Canada gets millions sent  from the other side.
8381 2018-12-05 13:27:22 Coconut oil and gloves all night.
Smooth and hidratated next day..use it several day if your doing is to dry..
I am using coconut oil for May things, my hairs as a masque to hidratated it , to take away my make up, excellent for that. And for keep my carvings away too.
8382 2018-12-05 13:27:15 Its Dundee and Glasgow’s oil is it
8383 2018-12-05 13:27:13 Somehow I think everything going on w/ Saudi Arabia , Russia and trump is dripping in OIL!
8384 2018-12-05 13:27:07 Yes but, crisps are just packets of oil and potatoes.
8385 2018-12-05 13:27:00 I do my own oil changes, maintenance, and minor repairs. Have overhauled a few engines and know how to re-machine parts.  And I still know diddly-crap about cars.

8389 2018-12-05 13:26:34 1. We should realize that 'mess' is subjective and trying to clean one's version of a mess up by limiting freedoms is creating an even bigger problem.
2. That's not fair should always precede "suck it up buttercup"
3. Indoctrination of children isn't okay.

8395 2018-12-05 13:25:48 “ other countries pollution”? The world consumes 93M barrels per day of oil. The USA consumes 20M barrels of that per day. Over 20%.
8396 2018-12-05 13:25:24 I dnt see ppl mking any difference in this regard, only 5 media kinds control all media outlets. And they are at the same table with oil kings. So in short too big to fail. Thy run the govts...

8399 2018-12-05 13:25:15 Canada, has many resources, the fact our oil has been discounted and we're still producing so many other commodities that remark is kind of absurd.
8400 2018-12-05 13:25:08 one of the big things that changed in my life was needing more sleep. I used to operate on 3.5 hours of sleep every day with a small nap at work. I'd paint oil paintings, play hockey, go to the gym and make PRs, play video games actively and be good enough at competitive ones
8401 2018-12-05 13:25:03 Can't wait .. 
This interview will decide the course of India and us relations and how it can affect the crude oil prices..

8406 2018-12-05 13:24:48 An oil & gas pilot project is needed as part of their approach says Mr. Irving, along with shortening permitting processes. There cannot be any compromising on the environment through such processes. #EconStrategy

8408 2018-12-05 13:24:38 I heard a report that it was about "rising fuel prices" when everyone knows oil prices are DOWN. This is because of radical left's HUGE taxes on fuel: an additional 26-cents per gallon, added to over $7-gal now? Seriously?

8411 2018-12-05 13:24:27 Many wheats must die to feed the pig-many more than to make the bagel. Actually, the pig is almost always alive as its being dipped in boiling hot oil, eating meat ain't ethical no matter how you put it, & it definitely ain't environmentally-friendly

8413 2018-12-05 13:24:16 There’s absolutely nothing wrong with sustainable palm oil. It is not the ‘devil ingredient’ that people are claiming it is.
8414 2018-12-05 13:24:14 Listening to Huey Lewis and the News in the waiting room as they change out my oil. Not bad,
8415 2018-12-05 13:24:13 That pleasant surprise when one discovers that every 5th oil change is free! Thanks @LeggatMazda!! #BurlON @MazdaCanada
8416 2018-12-05 13:24:02 I hate being burn by oil so much, and it happened every times I tried to cook.

8418 2018-12-05 13:23:53 We get help from China, Cuba, and Venezuela with that other stuff (infrastructure development, training professionals, oil on credit so that we have money to invest in education, development, and green energy).
8419 2018-12-05 13:23:52 When you get to work and realize you left your lunchbox at home, and you have to pay for your car to get an oil change today so you don’t want to buy lunch. Happy hump day! 
8420 2018-12-05 13:23:46 That sorry newer return my used oil.

8423 2018-12-05 13:23:37 A ver, 4-5 billion barrels no es una cantidad enorme. Pero sí, petróleo queda muchísimo por encontrar, el peak oil es una broma

Is this the America first thing, or the winning thing ? I’m confused.
8428 2018-12-05 13:23:14 Oil is running out. It only has a half century or so left as it now stands.

8439 2018-12-05 13:22:00 Too true. When we cover 80% of the story because the remaining 20% lacks decorum, we produce the shadows that we don’t want to think about, and make it so we never have to think about it. That leads to Jeffrey Epstein, palm oil, plastics in oceans,corruption at highest levels etc

8445 2018-12-05 13:21:23 Well, if you don't want to believe the science, you could come at this differently: do you love the land? Do you love nature? Do you prefer polar bears to oil rigs, forests to grid-locked streets with air that is making children ill? We have choices to make about our lifestyles.

8588 2018-12-05 13:08:40 There's also the factor that younger teachers have had a less interesting chemistry course at school. In my first term at secondary school I did chromatography of grass using organic solvents, distillation of crude oil and reaction of lithium with water. No wonder I was hooked.

8633 2018-12-05 13:01:53 Even the facts are wrong. There is no ban on palm oil. You will find it in many products in our stores. And groups of small famers have worked with the NGOs in favour of sustainability criteria (incl. deforestation).

Heat oil to 354° and fry on one side for 10 minutes then flip the chicken and fry the other side. When you bite into it the crust will stay intact. That's REAL!

8679 2018-12-05 12:57:40 It's absolutely critical to be on the right side of government policy.  
If governments hate big oil, and fossil fuels worldwide, that is a whole different story than them being a simple out of favour idea.  
This may be secular and permanent.  Then one must look to the future.

8723 2018-12-05 12:51:32 I don’t know of another president(s) that have loved the Sauds as much as the Bushes. With them it’s the oil thing. With Trump it’s his personal finances.

Beto is ok but has some serious issues with oil and gas, and is very mealymouthed at times.

Bernie Sanders is the one to beat Trump. Or, maybe Biden, or if Alexandria O-C was 35..
8727 2018-12-05 12:50:39 That's when we should use... babies being killed by planned parenthood are just a child(ren). See how long it takes for them to start spewing how the child(ren) should die. Bet it takes them 5 seconds. Hypocrites at its finest.

It's critical to face them head on, and move on, taking the loss the best we can.  
One of many this year for me was bullish energy stocks. I thought they were exceptionally cheap with $70 WTI.  
Then oil crashed. Why? Irrelevant.

8747 2018-12-05 12:48:45 Of all the shit things to make your piss boil in this world this is one of them? OK.... Why not get worked up about something that matters such as human rights, palm oil production, something important. Is it ok then for people to comment on short skirts etc for women?

8770 2018-12-05 12:46:32 Oh and most people neglect: A/C filter. Ask Lube shop guys to clean that up for you every other oil change. It fills up with dust fast around here. I change it once a year or year n half.

8778 2018-12-05 12:46:01 Actually the oil money went on buying the electorate’s acquiescence while the forbears of our current crop of dim ideologues financialised the economy and society for personal gain, all while pretending it would ‘free’ people - sound familiar?
8779 2018-12-05 12:45:52 6-8 hrs. Detangle you hair, put some oil before.
8780 2018-12-05 12:45:51 Quite honestly, the Khashoggi killing by Saudi Arabia state is just more of the same from America's oil / arms trough. To draw the line HERE after 60 years of amoral enabling is just more American hypocrisy within a foreign policy more commercial than based in justice or spirit.
8781 2018-12-05 12:45:44 The wife was making the salad as I put all that out. Salad is the pre/co-meal with our dinners. I didn’t do the bread,oil and parm combo this time, but next time for sure!

8806 2018-12-05 12:43:06 The risk now is that the public are in Brexit fatigue and will agree to anything, however bad.

I believe, soap removes all the great flavour build up with years of use.
8858 2018-12-05 12:38:44 If the going is bad, it’s due to international pressures beyond our control like worldwide oil price increases, if the going is good its because of him
8859 2018-12-05 12:38:43 Their attitude to the EU or not, they kept sole ownership of their oil and fish and saved the money, unlike us who have wasted it all by giving it to the EU and getting involved in wars we shouldn't have.

8864 2018-12-05 12:38:24 Climate change is the snake oil salesman coming to town
He tries to convince you snake oil is what you need
Then he sells the concoction to you

You get tainted oil
He gets rich

Climate control is just a elitists way to make $ from the working class
It's their companies making $
8865 2018-12-05 12:38:20 I have worked for many oil and gas companies where you have to take permission from managers if you want to use a certain library. This is pretty common in large corporate blood sucking companies. I remember asking for permission to use jQuery, 10 years ago and also AFNetworking
8866 2018-12-05 12:38:20 Why is Ian Wood even being asked for his point of view, he said during the 2014 indy referendum that oil was running out of the north sea stating15 years  left well look at the discoveries recently which was known about before hand, he is being told what to say, est brown noser
8867 2018-12-05 12:38:00 To all my envirowarrior friends out there. You can’t fight against new oil #pipelines meant to replace obsolete systems, use oil/gasoline/diesel (which includes eating... anything) then point to oil pipe leaks from systems operating 25 years past their OG lifespan as evidence
8868 2018-12-05 12:37:59 Yikes - yes, rashes galore being reported from these products. One person told me they used a different essential oil to 'treat' the rash caused by the 1st oil. 
8869 2018-12-05 12:37:57 Hey Bernie stop shilling for the Rockefellers. We all know they got out of oil and into renewable energy this is so obvious quit being a puppet.
8870 2018-12-05 12:37:52 CND uses 60bbl PER person, the highest amount! twice that of any other nation. We have never decreased oil consumption only increased. CND needs ever bit of energy we can get including solar, wind, Nuclear etc, the “green energy” is not sustainable evidence is Australia & Ont.

8875 2018-12-05 12:37:27 Admirable as this is and obviously a red flag to wur ain oil obsessives, the problem is that this is simple a "cause and  effect" approach. We need to question the need for a global transport system and then maybe transform it, not pander to global corporations.

8885 2018-12-05 12:36:19 If you gonna blame anyone, yes. As Oil said, had it not been found out, it would have worked through the system resulting in higher stock prices and eventual success. But I bet the little ntombi is not gonna listen to this. I bet she's gonna tell me she is not a racist either
8886 2018-12-05 12:36:14 As soon as you hypocrites give up everything you have in your life due to oil, we'll listen to you.

8887 2018-12-05 12:36:11 My favorite was the "fracking causes earthquakes or contaminates groundwater" thing.* When the question was posed about depth of earthquake vs depth of well and same for water table, the conversation usually ended. Same for groundwater.

8915 2018-12-05 12:34:06 @NHKWORLD_News Less than forthright/honest, on Asia Insight, to say Cambodians are moving to cities looking for work, and not say it's from having their villages bulldozed, land stolen, for creation of palm oil, for cheap Western junk food production.

8923 2018-12-05 12:33:34 Nope, if anything using stuff may dry their skin out even more, their skin is so new. It’s normal to get some flaking but you can just use a drop of olive oil but I’ve also known some mums to use coconut oil. That should be more than enough & lovely & natural to boot! Xxx

8926 2018-12-05 12:33:27 One of your best buys out there is Trader Joe's 100% Greek Kalamata Extra Virgin Olive Oil. At $8.99 a liter, you're getting a proven EVOO with complex, spicy flavors that's excellent for cooking as well as making salads or for dipping crostini.

8937 2018-12-05 12:31:40 When I meal prep I make egg white muffins. I used a cupcake pan spray with olive oil. Put spinach, pico de Gallo, and chicken sausage, and egg whites seasoning and bake for 20 minutes. Or I scramble eggs with veggies and chicken or turkey sausage

8944 2018-12-05 12:31:16 Indonesia comprises 17000 islands and is vulnerable to sea level rises as well as drought and flooding. It promised a 29% reduction by 2020 through migration to renewables but reliance on palm oil makes it difficult to achieve.

8947 2018-12-05 12:31:00 Best guess, loonie has been pegged at 1.3-1.32 by the bank of Canada. Possibly out of bear of inflation.

Gas prices dropping yet no movement on the dollar in a huge move lower for $oil.

Hell... I say there is a 15 percent chance of a cut since they have the loonie shackled.

8961 2018-12-05 12:29:40 Or allergic contact dermatitis. I had that happen to me by someone pitching the drug free merits of an essential oil. Ironically,  I needed steroid cream for a week to clear it up!
8962 2018-12-05 12:29:38 Went to the garage to buy oil for my car, as soon as I walked in the guy said “ I assume you don’t know what you’re looking for” so I told him In correct detail what I needed and he apologised & said “even men come in confused “ - can we stop assuming based on gender yet ?!
8963 2018-12-05 12:29:38 No lie, my family still in the cult told me that I should use essential oil, herbs, and prayer so god could regrow my exploded spinal disc.

My wife was intubated/sedated with 29% lung functionality from a rare form of pneumonia. They claim she just needed some essential oils.

At 18 you joined the military to fight in the oil wars.
At 21 you had Son and career that were taken.
By 23 you regained both only to lose them again by 30.

8997 2018-12-05 12:26:00 I get my research from credible professional scientists that aren’t biased by big oil and other lobbyists. You think scientific data is made up? The world is wrong I guess - you along with your lobbyists must have all the answers. You seem credible.

9023 2018-12-05 12:23:08 Oil has a false price. Speculation snd political pressure affect the market, the real price is below u$s 50. Cut with the oil use is a must.
9024 2018-12-05 12:23:04 Many won't like this, but indy could give us opportunity to stop using oil as fuel, there's no future in burning oil the way we do now. Missed the boat on carbon, we will pay the price, don't miss it on renewables, where we have advantage.
9025 2018-12-05 12:23:04 Russia is basically a third world country that trails behind Italy and Brazil. Its economy is much smaller than that of California, Texas and New York. If we can just double our oil output (their number one export) we can crush their economy even further.

9123 2018-12-05 12:14:25 I would personally  see as the main cause of an inflation spike the £ devaluation of 15% at the end of 1967. That would have increased prices, leading to an inflationary spiral, due to powerful unions.

Smaller than the oil crisis a few years later, but similar.

9155 2018-12-05 12:10:04 Yikes. New tech is needed to make green energy more viable. Said that above. We export the vast majority of our tar sands oil. As in we do not need it for our own consumption. No one is saying AB shouldn't produce enough to support its energy needs.

9159 2018-12-05 12:09:51 “Drink Valve Oil it’s good for you” -@JillianWeisberg
9160 2018-12-05 12:09:46 US oil glut ?? There are things called 'storage tanks' that are helpful for saving up supplies for future use. Of course, there are also things called 'shut-in wells' that serve the same purpose, pre-production. We used both these methods in the 80's. Backup for 'famine'  times.
9161 2018-12-05 12:09:38 What we need to reject are the lies. But we need to understand first why they are lies & reject authoritarian thinking. Example, some lazy ruthless people recently bashed Beto for taking oil money. That was a deceptive statement, a lie...
9162 2018-12-05 12:09:37 Why do we automatically have to pay people in the military respect? Like why do society look down on us not agreeing with warfare, bombing innocent children and stealing oil

Just cos they risk their life doesn’t mean it’s for a good cause and I have to respect or agree
9163 2018-12-05 12:09:36 Trump you are a liar since you have been in  office you have helped oil companies interests...

9171 2018-12-05 12:08:12 Yes, he's sad for his dad, as he should be. But we know the truth about his dad, he loved $ and oil. He did some shady sh*t, I just can't forget.

9176 2018-12-05 12:07:33 Buckle up. Obama lead the USA out of economic crisis. Trump's ONLY policy is to give his financial donors what they want. E.g. deregulated banks, allowed oil drilling in the Arktis and crushed the endangered species act, because his sons love to kill endangered animals.
9177 2018-12-05 12:07:31 @JoeNBC newspapers do not run foreign policy!  What do you want us to announce war on SA? Cut all oil from US? Raise us gas to $7 gal?  Yeah that’s working for PARIS!!

9180 2018-12-05 12:07:26 How can a oil refinery not account for over 600 barrels of oil? Then you purchase a system in 2010 it was never used and now it’s unusable. #PetrojamReport
9181 2018-12-05 12:07:07 1. So we should reduce the messes and maximise the blessings

2. "That's not fair" is the observation preceding fairer systems like democracies

3. 15 years old, and it's fine.
9182 2018-12-05 12:07:02 Ive only compared oils at RT vs 37. 37C oil performs better at 37 by most metrics with most lenses. We use manufacturer recommended oils in most cases, since they were used to design the lens. Most lenses meet or get close to specs with their own oil.

9184 2018-12-05 12:06:55 But would you bathe your son?
PS-I sell perfume oil
9185 2018-12-05 12:06:51 I worked for an oil refiner (in Texas, no less) during the 2008 & 2012 presidential campaigns, so my multiple small-dollar personal donations to #BarackObama showed up as #BigOil money. I can assure you I was not doing the bidding of the right-wing zealots running the company.
9186 2018-12-05 12:06:36 Good to know about it. Some International Company really eager to come to Brunei doing a business that related to Oil & Gas.
9187 2018-12-05 12:06:22 Finally someone here with brains. I had to explain it too. These idiots blurt nonsense without researching. Trump tweets as if he purposely lowered oil. He did by bumbling world order. He's pushing us into recession quicker. Predict end of 2019 just before elections. Thanks Trump

9191 2018-12-05 12:05:38 I had a short oilfield services stint before hauling crude in a truck.

There's a hell of a lot of science that goes into it. For instance, I've seen what happens when an incorrect fitting is used in a 5000psi bleed-down test (twice). I was the FNG, but knew it wasn't right.

9197 2018-12-05 12:05:07 I love working in oil & gas and I love my job... BUT it’s annoying that, by the time my friends get to their jobs, I’ve already been working for 3 hrs.  #earlybirdgetsthegas #NaturalGas

9199 2018-12-05 12:04:39 sugar taters!?

Here's a fresh, easy option, particularly in a warmer time:  chop celery, mushrooms, and cooked chicken; mix, with grated Parmesan cheese, add liberal olive oil.  Eat as main course or light salad/snack.  We have it in Brasil all the time.
9200 2018-12-05 12:04:32 I don't know, maybe it was his first product, maybe it's his specialist subject. Rather than look at him as a commodity importer, look at him as an olive oil business who imports his product. I know a number of importers of products who only import specialist products.
9201 2018-12-05 12:04:31 Big business for the future:

To cool down buildings and homes, we got to dig deep down, fill the holes with a concrete coating, to lead #heatpipes from the depth up to the surface.

This means big drilling business, not for oil or gas, but to cool us down.

9218 2018-12-05 12:01:44 @realDonaldTrump With the full boycott of Iran's oil until April, this regime will not last and in the coming months the overthrow of this regime is inevitable. I am on vacation, but I can not be indifferent to my country,
9219 2018-12-05 12:01:43 I think the belt is a bit beyond stuffed at this point sadly, and she definitely needs some oil before she'll go smoothly. The treadle wheel goes fine, as does the sewing machine, but a decades-old belt that hasn't been given a second glance...yeah 3:

9221 2018-12-05 12:01:14 I was thinking more about imaging at “room temp” vs. at the temperature the oil bottle says its RI was measured. I imagine not a huge difference in outcome (other factors likely bigger contributors), just curious because I just recently heard about it...

9223 2018-12-05 12:00:46 The frying oil used probably matters more than the # eaten. The amount of omega 6 & 3 fatty acids. Is there saturated or trans fat? How long has the oil been used & at what temp? Get those wrong, you’re stuck at 6. Right, then 15, but not often @EricRimm #6frenchfries
9224 2018-12-05 12:00:45 @realDonaldTrump As long as this regime exists, war and terrorism will continue, as long as there is peace, peace is impossible in the world. The world should be ready to cut off Iran's oil exports by April. The great flood in Iran is in a way that will see anything in its way

9250 2018-12-05 11:58:07 Yes, he received a lot of money... from everybody! He was the top recipient for oil and gas money because he was the top recipient from almost ALL industries. And the money was not from companies or PAC. They were smaller donations from individuals; and this is Texas.
9251 2018-12-05 11:58:05 Truth:Saudi,Russia,US ramped up production to squeeze Iran sanction.Trump eased sanction lets Iran sell oil to China/India. BACKFIRE! US largest producer of oil w/surplus.

9271 2018-12-05 11:55:53 Haven’t tested small changes in temp. So many variables - I think in the end sample RI and light scattering is the biggest limitation. Also, impossible to correct for spherical aberration at all depths and wavelengths with one oil or optical setup
9272 2018-12-05 11:55:53 Serve with a decent bread and ricotta cheese
Veggies have enough herbs and natural juices, no need for additional oil or sauce

9283 2018-12-05 11:54:54 @realDonaldTrump I consider myself responsible for this world and I can not remain silent, the danger of serious nuclear terrorism is the only way to completely boycott Iran's oil and support the Iranian people for regime change.
9284 2018-12-05 11:54:53 I know where you are going but the higher taxes aren’t just on oil.  It’s the same as here the middle class bears the brunt of the economic policies charged with “fixing the economy”.  Oil taxes is the last straw.

9291 2018-12-05 11:53:28 Nuclear power offers a strong opportunity to reduce this negative energy trade balance. Reducing the import of natural gas would also reduce economic dependence on Russia. Nuclear power also facilitates EV's, so less import of US/middle east oil.

9295 2018-12-05 11:52:23 @realDonaldTrump the missile tests of the Iranian regime show that they are destroying targets and wanting to acquire a nuclear weapon. The US government must complete the sanctions and not allow Iran to export its oil

Of course we’re a net exporter! You’re proving your own comment wrong! there is no “new” technologies it’s, Solar, Wind, Nuclear, Oil, Geo thermal. There’s limited Hydro in AB. Solar & wind are cost prohibitive & unreliable
9301 2018-12-05 11:51:47 Makes you wonder what @exxonmobil and @Shell are doing to allow this fraud.

Natural Gas is the energy of the future and today.

9302 2018-12-05 11:51:29 The way to do it isn’t to preemptively kill the internal combustion engine, but to tweak the response to the 1973 oil crisis so that it kicked off a multi-decade intensive R&D push that by the turn of the century would give energy consumers cost-effective renewables.

9317 2018-12-05 11:50:25 Hey! So I went to a dermatologist for years and NOTHING helped. In the past two years, I’ve been using pure tea tree oil at night (diluted) and just I just rinse my face in the morning and use Farsali rose gold elixir (which is all natural and “fragrance” free)

9383 2018-12-05 11:43:54 We export the majority of our oil. We are a net exporter and that's a fact. Alternatives to oil? Nuclear, hydro, solar, wind. We need to keep investing  in new technology to make green energy alternatives viable. Billions of public $ have been spent on oil production.

9411 2018-12-05 11:41:02 pronunciation of "Hanukkah" is not Modern Hebrewy, the USA is all "latkes" and "dreidels", and growing up, the oil miracle (not the military victory) was always emphasized.
Farkert! I claim חנוכה is a Yiddish word in Modern Hebrew with its antepenultimate stress and male gender.

9417 2018-12-05 11:40:40 With the matter of ptptn, pinjam, pandai lah bayar. The price of oil in the WORLD fluctuates, it happens. If the sultan didn't want to be involved in politics, don't say anything at all. Monarchs are also human beings hence I prefer Malaysia stays as a democratic country.

9421 2018-12-05 11:40:31 I disagree that the 1990 recession was caused primarily by a spike in oil prices. Inflation (CPI) was already in the 4-5% range in 1988 and 1989, likely at least partially due to the large government deficits, and this necessitated a rise in the Fed rate.

9425 2018-12-05 11:40:19 Not a surprise.  Most English people have been brainwashed into resenting Scots, but they still want our land, seas, oil and any other resources they can get their grubby hands on.  They want to control us, rule us and for us to shut the fcuk up and take it up the asre. #Brexit
9426 2018-12-05 11:40:13 That problem remains only in African countries. Developed and emerging countries are already well below replacement fertility.

People from wealthy countries need to consume less.  3600 kCal a day, 7 ton of oil equivalent energy a year per capita. That's the real problem.

9435 2018-12-05 11:39:15 The American government snuck in and stole all the oil.

9437 2018-12-05 11:38:53 You can be the first & last guest on the ‘Mark Ruffalo Settled Science Minute’, or the foil on ‘Bill Nye Saves The World’. I’d happily watch both.
9438 2018-12-05 11:38:52 Here’s a fact. Shale energy isn’t cheap but it’s abundant. The most abundant natural gas and oil reserves in the U.S. extracted using hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling.  Break even costs for Permian to Bakken Range $30-70/BO compared to $2/BO in Middle East #WapoSpin
9439 2018-12-05 11:38:51 Climate Change is not a Chinese Hoax and denying it, is a Big Oil Gas & Coal Conspiracy.

Dino thinks everything is politics and should be politicized, we hold the Qur'an with high esteem, our last drop of blood can drain because of this Holy book.
Learn to respect peoples religion.
9441 2018-12-05 11:38:44 The question is do they look at iranian production or Iranian exports? One is different from the other. You can keep producing and send to storage but that crude oil will be stranded so effectively off the market.
9442 2018-12-05 11:38:34 Oil prices can be down.

9461 2018-12-05 11:36:32 America ceases to be a 'responsible country' with your administration's determination to produce more coal, to drill for oil in the arctic, & to reduce pollution regulations.

Countless thousands of scientists are not wrong. You are ~ but you're too stupid to see it.
9462 2018-12-05 11:36:28 Nigeria has 11 States with crude oil: major oil States (Akwa Ibom,Abia,Imo, Edo,Bayelsa,Rivers, Delta, Ondo &amp; Cross River) + Lagos &amp; Anambra
9463 2018-12-05 11:36:07 #OPEC in October: Members should not mention oil prices in policy talks. What a difference ~$25 makes.
9464 2018-12-05 11:36:06 If you're talking about shale oil, there are a ton of regulations and concerns with that, as it requires fracking and a lot of energy/water to vaporize it, but emissions from oil-sand crude are 12% higher than from conventional oil. Haven't seen a number for shale. Have you?

9473 2018-12-05 11:35:25 One such monopoly has been legally granted to oil companies by not allowing the exchange of gas cylinders. A bad deal.
9474 2018-12-05 11:35:15 Keep living in your liberal fantasy world- oil isn't going away anytime soon. Until we start producing from Alaska, we are beholden to the Mid-East for thier oil.

9487 2018-12-05 11:34:11 Absolutely not true. We upgrade, refine, Trade & consume our oil. 
Oil demand is growing globally & domestically. We use so much we import oil from Nigeria, Venezuela & Saudi Arabia.

9712 2018-12-05 11:06:26 If RBI had cut rates today and had oil gone back to $75, inflation at 5-5.5%, then also people would criticize RBI for misjudging the inflation. Whichever way they go, they get bitten
9713 2018-12-05 11:06:18 Trouble with vegans is they don't see the bigger picture. They seem happy to rape the planet (our host body) using oil based synthetics which take millions of years to produce.They seem happy to have feral animals kill our own tiny marsupials. Among other things. My impression...

9718 2018-12-05 11:05:24 USA Markets are closed today. When they re-open nearly 3 Million barrels of Oil that usually go the USA will not arrive due to power outages, coincidentally on the same day the Vienna folks are poised to meet about oil production cuts.
This is the world you live in folks.
9719 2018-12-05 11:05:21 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
9720 2018-12-05 11:05:13 If you think people are out only for a 0.05$ raise on oil you are out of your mind. It's a more global problem, some people working can barely survive with a full salary because it's too low. At the same time Macron gave huge tax reduction to the richest so we feel the injustice

9726 2018-12-05 11:04:44 Here in Japan, there's a growing sentiment against renewables, and the anti-nukes movement has been the biggest driving force for pushing "clean coal" and fracked gas/oil. These people don't care about climate change. They just don't want to see any changes in their environment.

9730 2018-12-05 11:04:16 Worrying data from @IEA: increased use of gas and oil more than offset reductions in coal consumption in world’s advanced economies, resulting in a likely 0.5% uptick in their CO2 emissions in 2018, after five years of decline. IPCC says we must cut emissions 45% by 2030 #COP24

9736 2018-12-05 11:03:29 ཽ so i guess you will love china, because half of oil price in china is tax.  But none knows where are these tax gone and used for. But that isn't an obstacle for China to be a no1  carbon emission country. Plebs use cars too. And it's a bigger burden than the rich
9737 2018-12-05 11:03:26 Thank you for your reply. If you are using sustainable palm oil that should be stated on your packaging. As you stand against cruelty to animals I would have thought it crucial that you only use sustainable or not at all. It is a contentious topic, you need to be more transparent

9769 2018-12-05 10:58:48 Their oil production is already down, you’re right - they’ve past their peak production long time ago and will decline on their own. Another way to look at it is, they can’t help OPEC when they need them the other way - to increase production.
9770 2018-12-05 10:58:42 Massively yes. Methane is much more of a greenhouse gas than CO2, to the extent that it was once possible for oil wells (which often hit oil combined with small amounts of natural gas) to earn carbon credits simply by flaring their gas rather than venting it

9802 2018-12-05 10:54:28 Most convincing arguments on the other side to me are: 

1)higher number of constituents are in oil/gas so of course he has more $ linked to ind donors from oil/gas

2) as a proportion of $, it's not as substantial as indicated. He raised more $ so looking at raw $ is misleading
9803 2018-12-05 10:54:25 Not really. Rupert Murdoch donated to Hillary, & he
