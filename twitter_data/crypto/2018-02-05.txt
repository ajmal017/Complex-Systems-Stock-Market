5 2018-02-05 23:59:38 Stock market is also dropping pretty hard. Is it investers taking money of the table to buy some cheap crypto or is the whole financial market taking a dive? My bets are on moves to crypto. Thoughts? #bitcoin #ethereum #stockmarket #marketcrash #dollar

3/3. Even if crypto currencies settle down and eventually become an adoptable medium of exchange, it’ll likely be emerging tokens, not bitcoin that will win that race by being quicker, more efficient, and more practical.

12 2018-02-05 23:59:22 Rofl.... Funny, how the fiat currency owners all warn about the crypto bubble, even though fiat money is the biggest bubble itself. With no value backed at all and the bubble kept alive by ‚federal‘ banks pumping money in the system, that they created out of thin air...
13 2018-02-05 23:59:14 Exactly, we agree upon this. Luckily, my amount in crypto is just play money for me, but others have literally refinanced mortgages and invested live savings into this Wild West frontier. Caution and patience are our time tested friends.

19 2018-02-05 23:59:02 The premises outlined in the article (2/3):
1. You can be simultaneously bullish on blockchain and bearish on bitcoin.
2. The supply of crypto tokens is not de facto fixed. If prices hold up, a rush of upside-capping supply is almost a certainty.

47 2018-02-05 23:58:24 Staying positive but high key scared shitless
48 2018-02-05 23:58:12 Shocking!
Bitcoin price fell to pre CME futures news
Calling this a bubble above the 17.5k doesn't make you giniuos, in fact almost every crypto player knew this was coming, some were just not ready for it or don't really give a fuck - they want to stay in the game no matter what
49 2018-02-05 23:58:11 Nonsense? The only nonsense is people investing in  boutique products in which they have ZERO understanding of. You think crypto is hard to understand try wrapping your head around third level derivative vol products. Good times!!
50 2018-02-05 23:58:10 Cryptofolk it will all be ok
51 2018-02-05 23:58:06 Crypto currency needs to create value over competing wealth systems. For now it remains sophisticated software programs that are only as good as the network and people who manage them.
52 2018-02-05 23:58:03 Which crypto will you buy today? #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #Markets
53 2018-02-05 23:58:00 Stocks: Total carnage!  Chaos! PANIC I crashed 5% in a single day!!1

Crypto: Hold my beer.

54 2018-02-05 23:57:59 Por isso é importante que o blockchain tenha sua crypto como estrutura de manutenção independente de toda a rede e precificado a mercado. Isso faz a rede funcionar, mas ao custo da volatilidade.
55 2018-02-05 23:57:53 They should use the amount they need for offices and equipment and salaries for 1 year ahead and rest keep in crypto for future expenses.
56 2018-02-05 23:57:48 An overall crash of any market would force investors to pull out, and I think that crypto is the first place they would leave first. In the future not so much, but as of today, yeah i think so.
57 2018-02-05 23:57:47 Beware of fake forex/binary options scam brokers there seems to more than ever these days, incl scam crypto"ipo,ico's" frm fraudulant unregulated financial inst's offering bogus claims, be vigilant of scam signal services that are designed to steal ur money.
58 2018-02-05 23:57:40 The #Blockchain, #Bitcoin, #Crypto, has the ability to revolutionize all aspects of the business world. 

Those who have always controlled the world, and the media, want their part. 
Don't sell cheap. 

Don't be fooled by the manipulated news

65 2018-02-05 23:57:27 At CWC, we firmly believe in and fully support the use of #cryptocurrency. To show our support, we are #donating 10% from every #crypto sale to it's corresponding developers in hopes to help further progression of #cryptocurrencies as a global currency system.
66 2018-02-05 23:57:14 God youre stupid do you realize why crypto currencies exist. If people want to send money quickly they have literally 1000 different ways of doing it. Ripple is grossly over valued even at its current pricem it has basically 0 use case and just got pumped to hell

70 2018-02-05 23:56:52 Seriously.... everyone is talking about #Bitcoin crashing from $20,000 to around $6,000 that's just over 2/3 gone if you didn't sell. Imagine if you bought #Ripple at $3.30 USD and now it's $0.63 each. I'm seriously feeling for everyone today, take care in the market. #crypto
71 2018-02-05 23:56:35 Then rich again?...
72 2018-02-05 23:56:32 A lot less painful to hold USD right now. Think of all the btc you can buy as it heads down. Half and half hedge? options are good...

75 2018-02-05 23:56:29 Is there any way to track if the US stock market is crashing because money is getting ready to enter crypto?
76 2018-02-05 23:56:25 What do you think about the timing of all this? FUD driving down the prices... now awaiting clarity on US regulations on crypto just in time for Robinhood, bittrex USD deposits, and this. Preparing for a movement of money into crypto... throw in stock market being down
