146 2018-06-26 23:37:50 I know better than to try to market buy/sell during a move like that because I'll click the button and stare at the screen for 10 seconds while the price moves 90-100 ticks before filling my order

167 2018-06-26 23:34:27 I’m constantly catching myself too.  We are still a ways out and the entire market is pegged to BTC still, so I have no trust in the current valuations. I am concerned with a slowing global market and what that would mean for remittances and global investment.

Most of our audience isn’t very familiar with the crypto space so with only 80 seconds to tell a story we have to keep it succinct and high level

208 2018-06-26 23:25:15 It can be learned but requires experience, status (for access to info), wealth (to live off of to research), and ignoring red herrings.  I will say timing is easiest though when when you are pioneering an emerging field like Crypto.

212 2018-06-26 23:24:09 XRP is not needed for this transaction.  It’s within the bank...just in different countries. This is similar to xCurrent or Am. EX and Santander.  Could it be Ripple? Sure, but Ma already said no coins involved.
213 2018-06-26 23:24:09 Re Ali - Standard Carter - GCash...a DLT could be used since the bank is on both ends and there would be no use of any token.  Consider AmEX and Santander...US to U.K...same thing. In Ali’s case, S.C. Registers the payment, checks rates, spits out the settlement.

305 2018-06-26 23:09:49 The crypto space needs less bureaucrats, not more. Regulation is acceptable, but it should be based on self-governance and market action. It should not be based on the violence of mediocre politicians. I still hear too many people in crypto declaiming the virtues of government.

Also, LTC and BTC are almost mirror images of each other. I don't know any two crypto communities so similar.. maybe because they share many of the same proponents.

452 2018-06-26 22:38:54 It’s just priced in Euo’s which are pretty much worthless these days. I’d stick to USD or learn the yen or something. I think a Euro is like 15-20% less valued than the USD so it makes charts look weird. The general shape of the daily chart zoomed out should be the same.

565 2018-06-26 22:17:55 $BTCUSD painting a bull flag on the 4H chart, but I’m leaning more towards it breaking down and re-testing 5800 lows, possibly 5500 on the same move. A strong resistance at 6300 doesn’t make sense - this means that buying pressure is extremely weak right now. #bitcoin #crypto

567 2018-06-26 22:17:53 Tether is a top 10 coin-it has 0 chance of going up in value, is tied to the US fiat dollar, which is what the crypto market was meant to escape and has historically had increasing supply, manipulation and decreasing purchasing power....and some allege usdt is backed by nothing.

765 2018-06-26 21:52:22 Today @a16z doubled down on crypto. That’s because the fundamentals of crypto are sound. Andreeson saw it early in 2013 — now In 2018, even in a down market, he is still moving forward, unfased.

771 2018-06-26 21:51:51 What do you do in this crypto bear market? You have a source of INCOME (ie a job, dividends, staking, trading, etc.) to bring in income to cover your bills, make new investments with, wait out the bear. The investments in bear markets is what makes all the money!
772 2018-06-26 21:51:44 Considering India came out a few months ago and said they won't allow financial institutions to deal with crypto companies, I don't they will.  Could be wrong!
773 2018-06-26 21:51:36 Check for @ElectracoinECA sir. Big anouncement over few days!
774 2018-06-26 21:51:07 That's some next-level meta scamming. Invent the idea that centralized USD custody is actually a problem for anybody anywhere ever other than these completely unregulated wild west quasi-legal crypto exchanges, and then run a presale token selling scheme on top of that story!
775 2018-06-26 21:51:05 From someone who did the same and Is free falling in to more debt, the risk is worth it. hmu in two months though..
776 2018-06-26 21:51:05 Amps? Will it mine crypto? 
777 2018-06-26 21:51:01 "The Plenary agreed on a framework to monitor potential emerging financial stability risks of crypto-assets." Anyone know if that framework is publically available somewhere or do we have to wait until the July meeting?
778 2018-06-26 21:50:46 I used to trade stocks before trading crypto. When I go back to trading stocks that’s going to feel like a walk in the park.

783 2018-06-26 21:50:29 Whenever someone in crypto makes a definitive statement like this, I helps to mentally put "I hope to God that" in front of it and "or else I am fucking rekt" behind it
784 2018-06-26 21:50:09 Crypto, particularly BTC, is here to stay regardless of FBs involvement or lack of involvement. This is nice, but largely inconsequential because the tech and use case stand on their own merits. Make no mistake, this was a self-serving policy change.

791 2018-06-26 21:48:42 I think its bullshit when people claim that this bear market is good because its shaking out "weak hands".  How can the market grow if average investors are scared away so early?  Crypto needs a constant cash influx to maintain prices.  Am I wrong?
792 2018-06-26 21:48:42 I tell one, two recruiters every day that I'm not interested in blockchain projects. Recently recruiters have started to downplay that word and emphasize others in their descriptions of their client companies (which are incredibly vague, but of course they are). Interesting.
793 2018-06-26 21:48:36 " Don't wait for opportunity, create it "

Keeping a positive mindset during this bearmarket is key for survival. There is money to be made under every circumstances! Focus.

841 2018-06-26 21:40:48 I don't think you should include "Blockchain" as there are many different implementations using blockchains (besides it is just a data structure, it's like asking what the economic limit is of a binary tree is)... the cost to attack is much higher in other crypto w/ PoS (scaled).

847 2018-06-26 21:39:50 Give it a #Bitcoin wallet mate @elonmusk
848 2018-06-26 21:39:34 Yeah but wasnt that their sell from day one to invest in different investments aka crypto to make it easier for the average joe to invest. Have a read at their first whitepaper if its still public. Also the deal with bitmoth kinda sketchy.
849 2018-06-26 21:38:59 I’m not fearful it’s just reality. Consumer debt is also at an all time high. These are facts man. Am I saying crypto is the end all solution to everything? No, but I have chosen to hold crypto as a hedge and it’s worked out very well for me even with the  recent downturn.

856 2018-06-26 21:37:43 Ok, I’m in position. I’ll check back in my crypto after Christmas. I haven’t looked up in 5 months.  So, how are things?
857 2018-06-26 21:37:34 CNBC Fast Money pushing crypto again tonight.  Because my wife would love it if I put 50K in only to see it evaporate overnight when an exchange suspiciously comes "under attack".
858 2018-06-26 21:37:33 Can't remember the last time they had a guest that was bearish crypto.
859 2018-06-26 21:37:20 This is good for crypto, right?
860 2018-06-26 21:37:17 Really good. You do a viewing though. I love doing reference on @OpenRent . Tenant pays for the service. You just seat back and wait for result to come through. I also use rent guarantees from them. Easy!
861 2018-06-26 21:37:02 If you have any crypto questions, I’m all ears and neck-deep in it.
862 2018-06-26 21:36:43 @CNBCFastMoney please stop talking about the junk crypto currencies no one cares, if you dont people will stop watching your show.

897 2018-06-26 21:32:35 Or is it bc of their recent scandal which made advertisers warry and facebook need more advertisers so it opened them up to crypto again?

906 2018-06-26 21:31:23 Fixed a typo there. But.. Nothing is nicer than a nice cup of tea and some computational-number-theoretisin' ! Plus it's a fact that cryptography has kept the field funded for a large part, just like that of quantum computing. Even if people don't actually care about it.
907 2018-06-26 21:31:13 Ah, so that's who has been manipulating markets. Shame on you, Zuckburger.

961 2018-06-26 21:22:56 What has "barley" got to do with their ability to make adjustments?
962 2018-06-26 21:22:51 Charts are great and necessary. But the real skill is learning how to interpret them. Most of the time with the right things in place it’s obvious when it’s going to go up or down. Money movement is physics and psychology. But interpreting physics and psychology right 
963 2018-06-26 21:22:36 I don’t really think that’s an issue.  You deal with encryption every day and don’t even think about it.  The implementation is just still young in crypto, it will get more user friendly.

971 2018-06-26 21:20:56 The crypto bear market continues. Again, I think we flash crash/capitulate to $3K, then settle around $5K, and drag out for a year+ like in 2014 to 2015. We may not bottom till no one is showing up at meet ups anymore, like until the end ‘16.

983 2018-06-26 21:19:14 I dont understand te crypto guyz entering this market before 2014. They must be extremely rich and living in Puerto Rico now even they invested around 100 bucks around 2014. But guess what they are doing, shit posting and teasing plebs
984 2018-06-26 21:19:06 Imagine #ethereum is going to bounce pretty big soon.  #facebook lifted crypto ad ban.  #eth not a security.  #mtgox no selling until well into 2019.  All bullish.  #coinbase #bitcoin #gdax

As long as you are approved for running $crypto ads, it’s sweet 

So ideally, it gets rid of all the shit and clamps down on that further more, whilst allowing the verified ads to run clear....

1107 2018-06-26 21:00:43 These issues could have been raised due to rumours of Facebook (& google) offering rival [crypto] services in the near future and now they have reversed the ban to avoid anti-trust issues.

1117 2018-06-26 20:59:44 Dpos seems to incentivize «gaining votes» rather than *securing the network*. Because of that, they likely will do all in their power to acquire those votes. In politics, it can be done via manipulation of opinion, whereas in crypto other tools will be utilized.
1118 2018-06-26 20:59:41 SEC have made it very clear altcoins are not securities. Polo and trex will be the first to trade security tokens in about 8-12 months
1119 2018-06-26 20:59:11 $GIN @gincoin_crypto is looking promising. It’s currently the only new masternode I have picked up in the see of nonsense.

1121 2018-06-26 20:58:57 Depressing Crypto Stats May Give Many Pause
1122 2018-06-26 20:58:53 Yo me refería más a la  gran cantidad de proyectos que se escudan en blockchain y que terminan siendo nada. Yo si creo en blockchain, de hecho soy entusiaste de crypto y me gusta jugar a que invierto...
1123 2018-06-26 20:58:40 I'd say that it is there for the same reason than CNSA suite, government compliance.
1124 2018-06-26 20:58:35 So the hundreds of thousands of Muslims with non-Muslim friends, you're fine with these, and you'll accept them because by your logic they aren't 'real' Muslims?

And when you say "real Muslims" what you actually mean is some tiny conspiratorial crypto-fascist minority?
1125 2018-06-26 20:58:23  - thank you my friend - but I’m still gonna kick you ass at my next Meetup 
1126 2018-06-26 20:58:11 It’s not a vice either. It’s all on the individual and how it is used (or in your case it seems, abused).
1127 2018-06-26 20:57:55 Do you use amd to mine?
1128 2018-06-26 20:57:25 How about Maltese banks, are they more accommodating to crypto firms now?

Do you think they would incorporate it with enough people requesting or do they have other agendas?
1133 2018-06-26 20:56:32 So Facebook decides to allow ads for #crypto again. This shows that crypto is slowly pulling into mainstream #bitcoin

I am actually part of a new crypto-centric website looking for knowledgable crypto-enthusiast to contribute. We are holding a contest of sorts for writers willing to profile different coins. This is your chance to break into the industry!
1147 2018-06-26 20:53:59 Same bro bought it and couldn't sell it for some reason. I literally lost like half of what I invested in crypto. Damn I'm only 15 too.
1148 2018-06-26 20:53:29 Anonymous coins have the potential to show regulators the emperor has no clothes. 

They pretend they have regulatory powers when they are powerless. 

This is the dance you see between crypto and governments now.
1149 2018-06-26 20:53:26 I'm convinced the establishment uses SJW propaganda to help agents that have no history/nor qualifications in crypto to infiltrate crypto.

1153 2018-06-26 20:52:48 BREAKING: Facebook is reversing its ban on #crypto-related ads.

In and of itself this isn't a huge deal, but I'm hopeful it will send a signal to others that crypto is here to stay. Blockchain tech, tokenization & cryptocurrency will touch every aspect of our lives.

1198 2018-06-26 20:47:02 Yup, and the "192-bit" encryption they talk about is really CNSA (NSA's 2015 replacement of Suite-B), which makes a lot of sense in government use. It actually has AES-256 but other components are at most 192-bit level.

1235 2018-06-26 20:39:48 That's the idea of non-fungible tokens. Essentially you create for any topic, such as "crypto" an own token.
1236 2018-06-26 20:39:41 Well true but I guess crypto has not been around that long to prove that concept wrong. Would be good to reassess under current bear market. Lets ask @fundstrat to do it ;)

1260 2018-06-26 20:36:17 Comparing Crypto markets with Argentina is a rather scary looking notion.
1261 2018-06-26 20:36:05 I've seen crypto ads the entire time they said they banned them haha.
1262 2018-06-26 20:36:01 #DCC #Crypto team is distinguished by its professionalism and qualitative approach to the project implementation. I am sure that the result will not be long in coming.
1263 2018-06-26 20:36:00 Singing kumbaya and giving everyone participation trophies is not my idea of helpful. There are winners and losers. Don’t ask me. Ask life. Ask the market.
1264 2018-06-26 20:35:58 But seriously this is just a consolidation/accumulation technical bear move. Even the big bears right now believe in crypto long term. Upside is huge here
1265 2018-06-26 20:35:53 But evidence seems to indicate that a small allocation into crypto reduces stock portfolio volatility so still seems like a valid vehicle for them to start adding to their investment strategies. Thoughts?
1266 2018-06-26 20:35:43 Thanks bud
1267 2018-06-26 20:35:37 Wow this nice. More strategic partnership to build an excellent project hahaha.... #DCC #crypto

1303 2018-06-26 20:29:37 I don't think crypto will eliminate brand power (in fact the space is dominated by it). I think longer term it can help reduce how much groups are able to leverage it.

1314 2018-06-26 20:28:40 I was in $rdd since the beginnen with almost no initial investment. I also helped out the initial devteam. After that nothing changed since the  imho. Still small team promising the same things as back in 2014.

1402 2018-06-26 20:18:30 Buy and hold works for Warren Buffet because he buys stocks that pay dividends! You're not compounding interest in crypto with buy and hold.

1410 2018-06-26 20:17:15 no one's arguing with the debt issue. but you're clearly too young to even understand what it will take to fix that. its not crypto. get over it kiddo. buying crypto is not going to make you rich. the bubble has imploded. the game is over. fiat and central banks will keep going
1411 2018-06-26 20:17:10 get your ass beat in crypto first lol
1412 2018-06-26 20:17:05 this is the absolute truth. theres very few #OGs out there who actually tweet information that isn't solely to pad their pockets and its a shame because they have such a huge influence in the #crypto community. Crypto needs more @AriDavidPaul types influencers.

1415 2018-06-26 20:17:00 I agree, you should never put your eggs in one basket only. 

You should diversify your crypto portfolio in:

- BTC 
- FIAT
- big caps 
- mid caps
- micro caps
- pos coins
- masternodes

The last two made me happily survive bear markets.

1423 2018-06-26 20:16:02 @Google cmon reverse your blanket crypto ad ban, you know it’s not right. Facebook knows it, you should too.
1424 2018-06-26 20:15:58 Nice share!!  Listening made travels a little more interesting today!! I think he is no doubt on it.  But he reminds of someone on a hijacked plane (crypto 1.0) trying to convince everyone the toilet is backed up.  But nonetheless correct.
1425 2018-06-26 20:15:55 Big tech adapting to crypto needs.  This is a good development.
1426 2018-06-26 20:15:52 Yeah I’m just checking it out getting started, but yeah I’ll probably end up investing into crypto currencies sooner or later
1427 2018-06-26 20:15:42 I was always blown away by the sounds Tom Morello could get from his guitar. The scratching on Bulls on Parade was absolute next level.
1428 2018-06-26 20:15:37 Sometimes I feel like shouting “GET OFF MY LAWN” especially when people abuse the term “crypto”. But when I see others do it it’s clear this isn’t a good look.

1433 2018-06-26 20:15:19 #Cryptfunder #cryptfunderico ico has a great rating and most of crypto investors have got attention to this! ICO launches in 18 days so be ready to join with a great project!
1434 2018-06-26 20:15:14 Not my scene either.
1435 2018-06-26 20:15:13 They didn't realize yet that #crypto is in a limbo and ICOs have even a worse reputation than a year ago
1436 2018-06-26 20:15:07 I'm a tenant. It's all about the landlord - if they are decent then it will be a dream compared to dealing with moron estate agents. I've found it fantastic - the only thing that needs to "improve" is more properties (and landlords!)
1437 2018-06-26 20:14:47 I highly agree w @_jillruth below. The narrative of “don’t listen to non technical people” is nonsense. When I got into crypto and was working at Facebook, I “non technical” held a lunch Meetup where I would Facebook teach engineers crypto / blockchain concepts.
1438 2018-06-26 20:14:32 when did you begin in crypto?
1439 2018-06-26 20:14:13 I only went once with a friend from uni in Oxford. It was weird place, very hedonistic!
1440 2018-06-26 20:14:12 smashing pumpkins did it first for me, then slayer and deftones, then i found i could never play slayer - sepultura is lot more accessible for amateurs like me and i love playing them too. and marilyn manson, rammstein... anything drop D cuz it's nice. and loud.

1447 2018-06-26 20:13:05 Omar I appreciate your dedication and optimism in this space. I have to say though in the immediate term I am bearish and will be net short. I believe 2018 is the year that markets return to a state of stable dormancy (equilibrium) . The tides will turn in 2019-2020.
1448 2018-06-26 20:13:02 You should try and open a discussion with the Crypto Mining youtube channel guy and get him to address your issues - maybe he would do a Q&A with you.

1670 2018-06-26 19:45:07 Since crypto is almost by definition an alternative to traditional banking & monetary systems, if it's going to take off, it will almost certainly do so when people are tired of other systems. I think by the very nature of its setup, it will run counter to the rest of the markets

1703 2018-06-26 19:40:11 The promise of crypto is that code rather than brands will be used as metrics of credibility.
1704 2018-06-26 19:39:49 Listen up nerds: to all of you who want to make the claim that nobody uses crypto for illegal transactions, you're wrong. Yes, fiat is much more prevalent in general, but ask anyone who needed to buy anything on the dark web, myself included. BTC all the way

1706 2018-06-26 19:39:22 I think crypto can lead to leaner systems, more reliance on tech and less on brand power. Generally, you've been able to capitalize heavily on brand as it is the primary source of credibility. Accounting, escrow, banking, law firms, banks, have all worked like this.

1810 2018-06-26 19:22:47 The correlation between BTC and ‘Crypto’ is becoming less significant.

1814 2018-06-26 19:22:16 Surely they print it cause more money is coming out of crypto and onto the sidelines
1815 2018-06-26 19:22:04 Crypto Curve looks great, but 100 ETH minimum to participate in the sale?! I must not trading aggressively enough to consider buying in pre-sale lol
1816 2018-06-26 19:21:51 Oh Twitter and/or Reddit shills have claimed it, I seent it. Never the team. Still one of my top 10 alts none the less.

1819 2018-06-26 19:21:33 Too jaded by crypto space, 9 digit ICOs, ex regulators representing security fraudsters, guys who laughed at Bitcoin now explaining/BSing they studied public key cryptography to get into the industry, and of course crypto cult trolls.

1821 2018-06-26 19:21:19 You call  bcash common double spending issues "safe"??? From someone who knows shit abt crypto...sure.. keep the work soft and the porn hard! 
1822 2018-06-26 19:20:32 The 250m $USDT printed yesterday is more of a THEM-selling-everything-into-Tether-and-shorting-the-market rather than anything bullish or positive, imo. The market fluctuating in barts reflects this. I mean, it's a positive if you're shorting too, but yeah, bad news for #crypto.
1823 2018-06-26 19:20:31 Try to make crypto more adoptable as you mention. Would help alot 
1824 2018-06-26 19:20:18 Perhaps they shoved it into #crypto?

1827 2018-06-26 19:19:46 Crypto/blockchain stocks obviously yes (based on the above tweet)..... But for bitcoin and the altcoins, programmers I am being told are close to launching. I do not have ETA just yet, but was told on a webinar it is coming soon!

1842 2018-06-26 19:17:22 OMG I get so many crypto-pitch emails, I just assume every single one is a scam, even though I own Bitcoin. It’s like the sociopaths discovered crypto after Bitcoin hit $12k some time ago, and now nothing is safe

1848 2018-06-26 19:16:54 911 happened before crypto was even invented. Drug lords flooded the U.S. with drugs before crypto. Criminals do crime because they are criminals. They will do so with or without crypto.

1852 2018-06-26 19:16:13 So basically while we may be at the bottom generally speaking, we can't rule out new lows coming in until after the next few days. I see a prolonged dip and don't see any uptrends until after the 10th, maybe the 15th....
1853 2018-06-26 19:15:44 gonna laugh if crypto prices jump over Facebook unbanning crypto ads... i am pretty convinced Zuckerberg is going to create a cryptocurrency within a year, he sees its potential to transform internet commerce.

1883 2018-06-26 19:11:49 The problem is there's just 1 down breakout of the 200 MA, and now this in 2018. And that comes with a loss of 60%, not a 239% gain, in precisely 1 year after the day of the breakout. Or am I looking at bad indicators?

1905 2018-06-26 19:10:01 Crypto's potential supersedes current institutions / systems of money, KYC/AML is a result of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It's a bit like printing out internet meme's onto paper and faxing them to people.

1925 2018-06-26 19:06:55 I think @novogratz explained this best on CNBC. It really depends how soon these pension funds etc. start including crypto in their portfolio before others start following.
1926 2018-06-26 19:06:52 I can't believe how many VC types I encounter that still dismiss crypto out of hand, without nuance, regardless of how many other smart people go work on these projects. Must be nice to be so sure of oneself..

1956 2018-06-26 19:01:24 There has definitely been manipulation in the past.  This is not it however.  To kinda quote a former Texas rangers Manager Ron Washington “This is the way crypto go.”  #Nostraightlines.
1957 2018-06-26 19:01:23 Happy to help !
1958 2018-06-26 19:01:18 Je ne suis pas pour la communication de @justinsuntron mais je pense vraiment qu'avec le travail fourni par sa team.. Ce projet peu aller plus loin qu'on le pense

1961 2018-06-26 19:01:06 It looks like the crypto advertising winter is starting to thaw.

Facebook announced that it's going to be slowly reversing its crypto ban, & will allow certain pre-approved advertisers to promote their crypto & blockchain-related businesses.

1976 2018-06-26 18:59:51 It doesn't matter what photos I choose to post. But one thing is for sure and that is that I think BCH is the coin with everything: low fees onchain, scalable, easy to use, most secure, and the most innovative projects being developed on it.

1986 2018-06-26 18:57:17 It is extremely hard to predict the price of btc in 5 years, what i do know and do not need to predict is that if you were here around mt gox you should be all set. That part, the first 8 year run, it is in fact over. What is next? Stay tuned??

Which are good, which are bad, what happened during the last bear, etc. Well if you know all that and you were here before mt gox, you should be all set off this 8 year run.

2128 2018-06-26 18:36:52 This seems to be a well fleshed out project, my only concern is regulation. In my country the markets are largely regulated meaning 1/2 players in each state. This project brings in two uncertainties, one being regulation on crypto, the other being regulation on utilities.

2198 2018-06-26 18:23:52 Bloomberg should just come out and say "I hate cryptocurrencies because it threatens the fact that I have the market cornered on stock terminals."

2206 2018-06-26 18:22:08 To be fair, part of my original tweet was "update often". Even if not this one, we *will* keep discovering things. It is critical that people are reliably updating their crypto at this point.

If your biggest concern is keeping your nasty fetish from ANYONE, crypto is your best friend.
2245 2018-06-26 18:16:24 awesome! where are you going?
2246 2018-06-26 18:16:20 Out of all the TA tools used universally, I think head & shoulders is the most garbage indicator for crypto charts by far. The amount of people trying to find that pattern just to back their own bias is incredible
2247 2018-06-26 18:16:11 そいつはtetherUSDだな。アメリカドルと一対一で交換するIOUトークンだ。実態のあるドル紙幣は仮想空間では使えないから、こうやって交換所に預けてトークンを受け取ってやり取りをするんだ。日本にもかつてJPYを交換するジャパンリップルトレードって所があったんだが、懐かしいな…

2264 2018-06-26 18:14:08 Is this a positive tweet?  I’m unsure as it’s been so long. #btc #crypto
2265 2018-06-26 18:13:22 Lol! this Alex Cobb guy is running an XRP Cult. I said in his livestream that Bitcoin will not be going anywhere any time soon. People come in the market due to Bitcoins name. I got put in Timeout. Beware of Crypto Cults that can't except reality!!!
2266 2018-06-26 18:13:12 Of course there are no guarantees, especially in crypto and betting on overseas business ventures, the best we can do is gather information and speculate. I do respect the cautionary approach you seem to be taking. We all must consider the downsides and potential for failures
2267 2018-06-26 18:13:06 I feel like it's harder to know whether you have an edge at crypto trading/investing than poker. And my gut says there's a lesser % of ppl with an edge at crypto than poker. Agree or disagree?
2268 2018-06-26 18:12:58 You tweet so much that you need a list of your own. I’m gonna create a list called crypto that has only 2 members. You and @CarpeNoctom
2269 2018-06-26 18:12:51 You’re suggesting there won’t ever again be 100x gains in the crypto market, that the adoption curve has been superseded by one last great parabola & that it’s game over. I disagree. You can turn 10k into 10mil on the stock market if you know what you’re doing. Crypto ain’t dead

2292 2018-06-26 18:10:29 So I don’t think it’s necessarily true that you can get everything wrong in crypto but governance. There’s a lot of things you have to do right besides the governance component in the beginning - such as hiring and capturing sufficient developer network effects.

2346 2018-06-26 18:03:25 No, that is BS. Large institutional money do not hit crypto until there is better liquidity and stable exchanges. Institutional investors are playing with futures at the moment, which is not direct investment in crypto. Crypto market is too tiny at the moment for big boy funds.

2387 2018-06-26 17:58:20 Ich mag Erdbeerkuchen! . Und ich finde, die Politik macht (evtl.) interessante Cases wie Blockchain oder Crypto Valley pauschal schlecht, wenn es so im eigenen Parteiprogramm steht. Und das mag ich nicht. Aber so hat eben jeder seinen eigenen Geschmack.
2388 2018-06-26 17:58:06 That's what I'm talking about. The tight knit crypto community will be forever indebted to your proactive attitude towards spreading the knowledge and helping us to survive these tumultuous times.

2391 2018-06-26 17:57:45 Its amazing to me how many people get mad at crypto for not doing what no asset can ever do. go up forever, so they sell at the historically absolute worst time to do so (on the way down) then will get pissed when it makes its way back up and call it bs, until they fomo buy again
2392 2018-06-26 17:57:43 Nah I already bought the exact bottom 6 times

2394 2018-06-26 17:57:37 You know that Satoshi was against patents?  How do you know this?  In any case BTC was taken over by Blockstream so patents make a great deal of sense to avoid yet another takeover of Bitcoin as cash.
2395 2018-06-26 17:57:36 VC firm Andreessen Horowitz has hired its first female senior investing partner, (finally!) ending its all-male general partnership. Katie Haun, a former fed prosecutor becomes eleventh general partner as the firm pushes into the crypto sector full-time. @rhhackett
2396 2018-06-26 17:57:34 it's cool to be a contrarian but in some instances... you gotta go with the trend.

2402 2018-06-26 17:56:45 a16z’s new crypto fund’s implication that blockchains and cryptocurrencies are going to help the unbanked feels like they actually have no clue how to service people who are unbanked.

2449 2018-06-26 17:49:38 New exchanges alone don't push the price so much like in early crypto days. But I am very confident that it will rise just because of the fact that there is finally a product and everyone will jump back in.

2528 2018-06-26 17:38:14 I think it means if this bear market continues, some crypto people are going to end up institutionalized. 
2529 2018-06-26 17:38:03 Yet the values need not fall just because BTC falls. The utility and value of one crypto is not lessened just because BTC is deemed inefficient and lacking real utility. Let us judge the merit of all cryptos individually and affix fair value. Everyone should want this except BTC.
2530 2018-06-26 17:38:03 I have decided to spend $ every time I make some money on crypto.

2604 2018-06-26 17:26:15 Totally agree that 
1) Coordination problems are huge holes
2) Decentralized systems can theoretically solve them
but the honest question I still have is

What are examples of coordination problems that have been solved by crypto (or we seem well on the way to solving?)
2605 2018-06-26 17:26:04 LOL, I think Congress should also take a look at how currencies in general are being used in drug and sex trafficking as well. It maybe a bit naive on  my part, but why don't they do a study on how Crypto can help people and the global economy as a whole, right?

2645 2018-06-26 17:20:27 I can understand this argument but I'm not sure the tradeoffs are worth it:

1) Stagantes censorship resistance innovation.

2) Sets into motion unfair advantages for large establishment cryptos which further stagnates innovation.

3) Encourages crony capitalism in crypto.

2662 2018-06-26 17:18:13 Think this: how many other real blockchains could sustain Cryptokitties without batting an eye? If crypto in general is useless we're all REKT.

Open sourced P2P is the biggest revolution in the financial world since salt was traded for pu55y.  No more secret ledgers held by the king! Crypto truly can return power to the people. Possibly.

2780 2018-06-26 17:01:01 In the next 24 to 36 months, I bet we’ll hear about some bone head #HOAmanagement company that used their client’s funds to day-trade crypto currency and lost their shorts in the process

2781 2018-06-26 17:00:44 My hope though is by the time I'm ready to go move next crypto and smart contracts and tokenized assets will have filled the void so traditional banks aren't needed. I was told today I needed a fax machine since they don't know how to (want to) use email yet. This is 2018!

2790 2018-06-26 17:00:06 That’s old news, of course that goes without saying. But im replying to folk in Crypto who actually have the notion of ‘let’s do this without banks’. Its not logical in the medium term at the earliest.
2791 2018-06-26 17:00:01 I cannot find a price for that crypto currently. I am always looking to learn more.

2793 2018-06-26 16:59:24 Ik denk dat het beter is om te concentreren op blockchain toepassingen om democratische processen transparanter te maken. Een ‘nationale crypto’ is een contradictio in terminis. Crypto is alleen zinvol als het geen centraal regulatie/controle mechanisme kent.
2794 2018-06-26 16:59:16 Consider the second order perverse incentives you're putting into place.

The crypto that's best able to lobby (ETH, ZEC) wins?

What about young upstarts without that don't have the resources to lobby?

They get suffocated in their crib?

2803 2018-06-26 16:57:14 Need to hit 50cents and 1$first. I would be careful with overoptimistic predictions. Those new to crypto might get a wrong impression
2804 2018-06-26 16:57:10 Ripple is not legit crypto. It’s centralized and controlled.

2814 2018-06-26 16:56:15 Unpopular opinion for some: $DOGE will remain in the top 50 for the next 5 years.
2815 2018-06-26 16:55:43 Crypto is going to create the first class of trillionaires over the next 20 years...
2816 2018-06-26 16:55:35 I don’t care much for volumes. We don’t even look at that as an indicator. Most of the volume is fake and manipulated anyways
2817 2018-06-26 16:55:30 Crypto traders in 2019 will be like:

"Damn! I wish I wouldn't have sold all my #lupecoin at 0.00000000 BTC"

@senorLupe
2818 2018-06-26 16:55:28 It’s sad to see people call certain projects “shit” when they have businesses and industries accepting their crypto as payment options. $XVG is one of the few coins I see actively getting mass adopted by vendors. #iDontHaveABag but give props where it’s due.

2824 2018-06-26 16:55:07 Unpopular Opinion: 95% of coins don’t have a community and never will
2825 2018-06-26 16:55:04 Is crypto only a space for TA experts?  Is it not for ppl who don't care about TA to come and make an investment based on fundamentals?  Is it just a battle of the TA's?
2826 2018-06-26 16:54:58 No you want them to ban it to force your crypto to continue innovating on censorship resistance in order to survive.

I want the government to try to ban Bitcoin, this kumbaya moment between us and them stagnates censorship resistance innovation.

Lower your time preference.
2827 2018-06-26 16:54:49 I'm glad to see this far that crypto twitter does in fact shower
2828 2018-06-26 16:54:38 I really like my job. I really enjoy my work outside of crypto. And I think this is life goals many people fail to accomplish! Do what makes you happy and proud at the end of the day! 
2829 2018-06-26 16:54:31 hehehe :)
2830 2018-06-26 16:54:28 I honestly might increase my diversification into crypto by another 5%. This could get really ugly.
2831 2018-06-26 16:54:17 If there is one quote that accurately explains the responses of the bankers this one is it: "All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed.

2835 2018-06-26 16:53:39 Investing in crypto seems like a smart idea, except it's not.
2836 2018-06-26 16:53:36 Gee, I wonder if the $250MM $USDT move and the $1BB move in $ETH yesterday have anything in common. 

The real question now becomes, where will this ETH be allocated in the market? Time to scope some new projects

2839 2018-06-26 16:53:08 @theBreauxLee
It'd be great if he succeeds, it'd help push crypto into the mainstream community. However, considering the smartest dev's from the million different projects have not been able to make their 'coin' mainstream, I have my doubts Akon will. 
I hope I'm wrong.
2840 2018-06-26 16:53:01 No, it's arrogance and incompetence.
2841 2018-06-26 16:52:46 Regarding volume, I keep 'hearing' that volume is low but considering prices, it seems pretty high to me. How do you monitor volume?

2881 2018-06-26 16:46:19 Yeah, I agree. During the whole 6 month bear market the hash rate have gone up exponentially, not just for BTC, but Eth and LTC too. Also, I have been a VRM miner for a long time now. Good to see VRM hash rate stay pretty high too. :)

2938 2018-06-26 16:37:25 So a US Citizen traveling from abroad may NOT be allowed re-entry to the US b/c of his/her religion? That's absurd as hell.

It’s fun to pretend.
But when legislation is passed forcing a person to act as if they believe someone is what they are pretending to be, it ceases to be fun. Then it’s just scary.

3063 2018-06-26 16:18:00 I can’t preach it enough. $15.50 for $ETC is extremely undervalued. If you’re worried about price being higher than what you usually buy, don’t be. The supply is dramatically lower than the rest of your Alts. #DYOR

3119 2018-06-26 16:10:52 I cannot find a price for that crypto currently. I am always looking to learn more.
3120 2018-06-26 16:10:38 Use case potential is wild. Top 5 market cap is a long ways down the road tho. 

Also, concerning the market volatility- that’s kind of what attracted me to crypto to begin with. Nothing is more exciting than a nice bull run, especially when BTC went from 7k to 20k in 3 weeks.

3125 2018-06-26 16:09:32 Hehe. Jeg står for at det er rasjonelt å ha 1-2% av porteføljen i crypto. Oppsiden har historisk vært uten sidestykke, samtidig blir nedsiden begrenset til porteføljestørrelsen. Jeg er nokså sikker på at det er rom for et marked for desentralisert verdilagring.

With that said, why are current conditions so painful to the point I envy Turtles for having a shell?

.PRACTICALLY that means you entering a room where people are pouring out panicking and crying - or you have to leave the crowded party during its sentiment peak.

3428 2018-06-26 15:33:35 How to be a successful crypto TA expert:
1. When a coin is at an all-time low, it's an accumulation zone
2. When a coin is dropping, look for bullish divergences
3. When a coin is in a falling wedge, use a big fat arrow upwards as a breakout that is inevitably going to happen.

3478 2018-06-26 15:28:35 If the market drops enough it can shake a lot of people/companies/coins creating these issues 

In terms of traditional investments and markets, crypto is kind of a joke with all these schemers polluting its streets 

There will always be scammers but the bear market does help

3484 2018-06-26 15:27:56 The sort of unfortunate event that overtook the CDO. A lack of trust, leading to a large uncertainty whether the CDO was going to be worth anything tomorrow. In the crypto world (look at my profile), that could be a rumour or discovery of a cryptographic flaw - not unknown, eh?

3505 2018-06-26 15:25:51 If crypto assets develop, there are all sorts of interesting possibilities for “tokenizing” physical things like real estate, digital thinks like intellectual property, and other kinds of rights, using financial engineering and analytics tools Wall Street has developed over years
3506 2018-06-26 15:25:49 This market can flip faster than you can blink. 

Getting rich in crypto requires timing and PATIENCE.

XRP dropped 97% for 7 months before rising 2000%.
BTC went from $6k to $20k in 35 days.
NXT gained 1300% in 35 days.
TRX gained 7000% in 1 month.

Get perspective.

3520 2018-06-26 15:24:23 I REALLY feel bad about my controlling the universe this way, but if I HADN'T invested in crypto, it would've gone way up and I woulda been mad. So it's a bittersweet victory.

3594 2018-06-26 15:15:56 If the centralised server is down, your crypto collectable and their owned crypto composables are just cryptic hierarchal deterministic addresses. Someone will make state channel tech compatible with ERC723 tokens, so main challenge here is interoperability not scalability.

3634 2018-06-26 15:11:57 It has some small benefits. Just none to the security or integrity of the network or protocol. If you're not a retailer and don't receive many small payments in crypto, then there is no need to run a non mining full node.

3639 2018-06-26 15:11:38 go somewhere, a field or park. Shout as loud as you can. Thats one hell of a way to relieve stress. Another stress reliever, go to a rave and jump around like a 10 year old. Works for me.

3648 2018-06-26 15:10:51 So I'm not criticizing the idea of blockchain + real state.

But the token itself is a big no, unless I can purchase directly with Bitcoin(or other relevant crypto with volume), otherwise slippage when buying real state will kill this.

3658 2018-06-26 15:09:24 I think the potential for a swing up or down is just as volatile as crypto is rn. Hoping it'll follow recession and fall initially with a delayed spike while faith in currency turns digital

3674 2018-06-26 15:08:21 Stating ‘this is not financial advice’ is essentially stating you’re afraid to make  mistakes.

Being afraid of making mistakes is essentially booking NO progress.

3784 2018-06-26 14:56:08 I've noticed a lot of crypto channels have went inactive or just straight up been deleted since this bear market. During the next Bull Run I am curious how many new crypto experts are going to pop up and tell people to buy at all time highs. Smart money will be out by that point.

3827 2018-06-26 14:51:20 He is right on several things, the manipulation is coming to a head, people who use the terms FUD and HODL will inevitably lose money and if Tether blows up 2k is the minimum we drop. But we do not see the regulation as a negative, crypto dies without regulation.

3875 2018-06-26 14:46:07 One of the most interesting things about the @a16z announcement was their explicit intention to hold their crypto investments for 10+ years.

This is not about getting rich quick; it is a long-term and focused bet on an emerging new asset class that will take years to play out.

4031 2018-06-26 14:22:15 Unpopular opinion: I see no reason this market will not continue sideways to downward in the short term. Most likely capitulation will happen followed by strategic bullish market news to signal a new bull trend. Without a major market moving catalyst- ETF, etc we continue down.

4054 2018-06-26 14:19:05 Looks like ICX is going to break down and out of that wedge I showed you all yesterday. Unfortunately, we have to wait for bitcoin to do its thing before I can give you a concrete number. But, no doubt BTC is going to come down soon too. I assume a retracement to $1.44.

4060 2018-06-26 14:18:41 Yes Ripple is undeniably a company. A company that utilises XRP. Which is a decentralised digital asset that Ripple has less and less direct control of by the day.

4062 2018-06-26 14:18:26 Have. Also requested on the github and even tried to contact Jimmy and CSW directly. All of it has gone ignored and, in fact, if CSW responds he does it with attitude instead of from a public relations perspective. Now that the patents are in place they no longer have an excuse.

4154 2018-06-26 14:07:55 ...and you call yourself a maximalist! You need to eat a stake to atone, asap

Can't blame you though -- our dollars smell like maple syrup after all
4155 2018-06-26 14:07:48 like many have said, exercising helps tremendously. If you are somewhere near nature, then exercising outdoors simply by walking in nature under the sun is amazing. Whether it be at a beach, in the woods or on a mountain. Therapists in japan would even prescribe “forrest walks”
4156 2018-06-26 14:07:47 Already expected you would blame me for exaggerating
4157 2018-06-26 14:07:46 Erm kinda freaky to see your face. All this time I've just been imagining what you look like and now you've changed your avatar I don't know what to do with myself. Time to leave crypto now it's too mainstream 
4158 2018-06-26 14:07:45 So why is he saying this now when he has been saying that Bitcoin will fail? This guy is utterly clueless.
4159 2018-06-26 14:07:37 What gets me about crypto is that its really based on nothing so the whole way it works is so haphazard
4160 2018-06-26 14:07:31 It's not like Binance doesn't fake volume though :D

4170 2018-06-26 14:06:13 What do you think would happen if everyone in crypto followed TA? But specifically, if they all followed just one same specific “expert” and tried to adhere to the possible moves and trade accordingly. Would the markets move at all? Would be impossible I suppose b/c of emotions

4221 2018-06-26 13:59:57 To warios point, i think it is entirely legit to be short term bearish and long term bullish vice versa. From 20k to 9k in the short term is pretty bearish, but establishing somewhat if a bottom around 5-6k(+/- 20%) is overall a pretty bullish sign to me. Disagree? :)

4223 2018-06-26 13:59:43 For some the extreme swings are attractive, but.... To succeed I would always recommend watching how technical analysis is used specifically for crypto for at least 6 months, otherwise you could lose a lot of money. I'm certainly not a holder. Risk v Reward trading only.

4230 2018-06-26 13:58:52 MV=PQ doesn’t actually work in practice for valuing Crypto. 

1- too circular 

2- too many assumptions

4- unknown correlation of variables

4297 2018-06-26 13:51:04 If Ethereum is not a security, that means it is not subject to federal securities laws therefore, Vitalik and his team do not have to register the sales of Ethereum coins with the SEC. A plus for crypto.

4309 2018-06-26 13:49:50 I can't even spend my Eos yes lol... Blockchain tech is still 6 years away.. the new currency might be getting introduced later this year.. people hate crypto now, so trust needs to be rekindled. Unless they throw us into fema camps, and give us the mark.
4310 2018-06-26 13:49:48 Most people in crypto don't understand this, I also presumed that 95% of them are in it to make more fiat for their old-world bank account. It's one of the main reasons why I think we should all debase the value of bitcoin from the fiat currencies that enslave our future.
4311 2018-06-26 13:49:38 All these crypto nerds are in my mentions now completely missing the point of OP to correct me on my already sarcastic statement 
4312 2018-06-26 13:49:28 True, so far futures have only brought miserable things to the mass of investors... Why? This means Tron is only developed as a means for financial investors and not for mass market adoption of crypto as a payment and service platform... Bad news Justin! Just what you needed!

4334 2018-06-26 13:47:03 Agree with you. People would sell crypto for essentials if there is another recession or depression. People will turn to Bitcoin during big currency crises.

4362 2018-06-26 13:43:18 People that don’t short $BTC or #crypto and don’t use leverage (like me) are likely already invested or waiting for an optimal entry. The risk/return right now is mainly for day traders. 

This can explain why there’s smaller movements as well.

4411 2018-06-26 13:36:57 Put it this way, those who are brave enough to dive into such a developing landscape, technology and emerging market like crypto will reap much bigger rewards than the majority who will eventually fomo once crypto begins to rival Wall Street.

4503 2018-06-26 13:26:39 In crypto done right, your protocol project should be impervious to your hand the moment it’s released. It’s hard to do both technically and ethically.
4504 2018-06-26 13:26:36 Also, if you are getting hit with a lot at once, you should try to space out what you can control by canceling activities and procrastinate what you can without causing damage. Take things off your plate or delay action where possible.

4843 2018-06-26 12:43:14 So why did Bitfinex Chief Strategy Officer Phil Potter Tenders Resignation? Stating it was time to leave and seek other opportunities as #Bitfinex pivots to other international markets.

4861 2018-06-26 12:40:14 The point isn’t the prior art in itself, but the “inventive step” criterion. Namely, would this “invention” have been obvious to a person skilled in the art given existing prior art. Since you are such a person, and clearly used the term “obvious”, how about a patent challenge?

4946 2018-06-26 12:30:23 What?? You are saying because vitalik shared his intellectual property to help grow bitcoin into what it is today it can be hijacked & shutdown by some company that files patents? Am I reading that right?

4997 2018-06-26 12:26:08 Sure, that gets you a lot for sure. But, using asymmetric crypto has some additional niceties of not sending a credential that might get logged by some server, being insecurely hashed, etc. Given webuthn gives us a legit “API”, why rely on shared secrets going forward?
4998 2018-06-26 12:26:07 LOL yeah right. They just want to patent everything $ for usage.

5098 2018-06-26 12:16:31 I'm not sure 'Trust' is the new primitive. 'Consensus', maybe - an agreed perspective on the world. I worry that the main problem Crypto has is that it's a tech solution in search of a problem. Very few companies in this space seem to have worked forward from the problem.

5167 2018-06-26 12:05:47 You know how we tell ourselves to spend less time on twitter? My problem with that is that I'm trying to learn as much as I can about crypto and Twitter is by far the best place I've found for that. There are so many interesting rabbit holes that pop up on an almost daily basis!

5169 2018-06-26 12:05:29 I think it would be interesting if you added nodes for your competitors’/imitators tokens! Like $JEW ... could be a super interesting way to poach some users and grow the node-hosting business segment overall, all benefiting $GIN in the long run!

5284 2018-06-26 11:50:30 You can only buy with btc? I can't find otherwise. .

5288 2018-06-26 11:49:40 I thought one of the main attributes of crypto is to stop inflation, and prevent loss of value. Instead you buy one coin for 300$ and few months later you can sell it for 70$. Amazing
5289 2018-06-26 11:49:35 Ty very much. I think it is Not that Bad 
5290 2018-06-26 11:49:34 I am hesistant to load any shorts at this stage in case we get a fakeout. When would you be inclined to start loading shorts?
5291 2018-06-26 11:49:31 But cant the cost production go down? Price of btc drops, people turn off their miners, because they aren't even breaking even. Difficulty goes down. You see where I am going?? I doubt it will happen, but it can.

Point is that the attitude towards crypto’s is getting (very) negative, which could mean that we are finally at the point of return to the “bulls” in cryptos.
Same happened with the goldmarket around 2011 and equities.

5407 2018-06-26 11:33:56 Sportsbook could quickly change if @PinnacleSports open up crypto but they don't seem interested (which is mind blowing).
5408 2018-06-26 11:33:52 I heard a rumor the man, the myth and the legend might attend in the flesh 
5409 2018-06-26 11:33:45 TokenUnion with fully autonomous rewards distribution is a better way to save your crypto

5414 2018-06-26 11:33:09 maybe it's because bitcoin as a speculative volatile asset  isn't ready to be handled as a normal currency? They are trying to bring crypto to the normies. They are stabilzing the whole infrastructure of the cryptosp by building bridges with real value.
5415 2018-06-26 11:33:06 So a third party is currently cold calling members of staff offering a copy of their “how to avoid crypto ransomware attack” document.
I’ve just said no as I don’t want to open my company up to such a risk.
The guy across from me just said yes send me it.

5416 2018-06-26 11:33:00 That’s awesome!! Looking forward to it!
5417 2018-06-26 11:32:59 Yeah very true. And Ronaldo gets special treatment if you even look at him

5419 2018-06-26 11:32:45 The race for betting in the crypto space is heating up. Feel @betrium will win the race if they contuine to focus on developing the product and features. @TryBookiePro doing well also but basically a true betfair clone without offering anything new. @wagerrx seems to be stalling.
5420 2018-06-26 11:32:43 But the bubble already popped. He is quite late. Next months we see bounce and the last wash out in crypto. Bottom building and end of 2019 back to 20k and beyond. Patience
5421 2018-06-26 11:32:43 Bet on the underdog applying a Martingale strategy, what could go wrong?

5423 2018-06-26 11:32:35 yes i see the same way, actually my targets are 1. load off 7.7-7.8 , and then i will load off the rest 7.45 - 7.3,  then from there going long to retest the resistance

5428 2018-06-26 11:32:12 In crypto curency world. There are so many people trust that coin is a big bubble and some day in the future, this bubble will be boom.
No, if you have knowledge about blockchain, you will not thing like that.

5455 2018-06-26 11:28:51 Currently the wealthy can make millions in profits from stocks and pay 20% tax. The general public in Japan are big holders of crypto (poor man's stocks?). They must pay 55% tax on profits over $200k. This law needs to change.

5485 2018-06-26 11:25:16 Bitcoin introduced blockchain to the world, but it was never going to be capable of being a currency.  It's time for the next generation of crypto to take the helm.  XRP has no equal and will fulfill every shortcoming of Bitcoin

5506 2018-06-26 11:22:38 Bakalım yokluğumu hissedecek mi diye merak ettiydim 
Hissetmiş. Geri kaldırdım.
5507 2018-06-26 11:22:24 Let's hope so. Crypto sucks at the min, unless you have money for the sales.
5508 2018-06-26 11:22:21 You can’t change willingness. But..
Audience - Twitter. Go viral. Grab some influencers (ie. Lil Yachty). 

Capital -Backstage Capital, gofundme, back it in a crypto

Education - plenty of free online classes.

Problem is, how do we get us to know all this/access to tech.

5522 2018-06-26 11:20:28 Long time equity guy here.

"Confidence"?  Based on something.  Econ, military, etc. in traditional world....adoption in crypto?.  Each "type" measured differently?

Crypto is combo of currency & equity.  Generating demand is KEY price increase.  "Utility" euphemism for "demand"?

Charting is not predicting what's gonna happen, it's showing possible scenarios which the charter uses as one of his tools for trading. 
A chart might be wrong in your eyes but it tells the trader that the scenario doesn't play out and can act on it

6273 2018-06-26 09:10:59 The sad fact about crypto is that from a new & fresh beginning, old rot has wormed its way & set in & greed is what fuels it now instead of the innovative new blood which came up with a fantastic new way 4 a new future 4 all... very very sad

6277 2018-06-26 09:10:16 In institutional lingo if you thought crypto was overvalued at 20k you’d reduce their target exposure from the 10% in my example to like 5%. And put the additional 5% somewhere else. What they wouldn’t do is keep the 10% but switch from fully invested to hedged. Again semantics
6278 2018-06-26 09:10:15 My 2 year old knows more about crypto than you.
6279 2018-06-26 09:10:07 Still think its a long way off before real money comes into crypto - its still seen as far too volatile and scammy (both of which are true) - why would they risk billions when they dont need to..

6383 2018-06-26 08:50:23 so you think blockchains should be governed by.. state governments? that would amount to censorship! BTW, what specific ETH scandal(s) were you thinking of?
6384 2018-06-26 08:50:02 In regards to crypto Sir Moe is absolutely right. It’s why I constantly talk about benchmarking. Nobody in crypto even knows what they are trying to do. Buying the top 100 cryptos by cap and rebalancing would be a fantastic strategy that would beat nearly everyone

6406 2018-06-26 08:45:16 yeah, I'm trying to distinguish between utility / usage vs. store of value. Each crypto could function differently. Could BTC become the reserve cryptocurrency (store of value), while ETH becomes the utility (medium of exchange). For medium of exchange, we cant afford volatility

6603 2018-06-26 08:05:16 TBC gives YOU a choice!

6633 2018-06-26 07:59:57 No no. He just doesn’t appreciate the effort in which took place to provide extra curricular activities such as vacation. Or what the cost of owning a home and providing for a family.
6634 2018-06-26 07:59:39 It's when crypto stops comparing itself to fiat is when crypto has made it in a mainstream sense. We are obviously a long way off that mark.

6643 2018-06-26 07:56:28 people like that never use token and if they do , they don't trade / swap / swing or  convert , they going to shopping mall take their credit card , buy token of the mall and shop with fidelity card. and they never know nothing about crypto and protocol

7107 2018-06-26 06:24:58 Actually a very good question. The answer is simple though. XRP is not "superior tech" in any way. These are early days in the crypto-world, and most investors are confused and mislead by scammers.

7171 2018-06-26 06:08:52 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。

7173 2018-06-26 06:08:26 Crypto may just be the tip of the iceberg for Blockchain, but it’s the tip that will sink the Titanic of Centralized Control. The future possibilities are endless and alluring but let’s not forget we must keep building and perfecting sound money.

7214 2018-06-26 05:59:22 I have told time after time. "Hacks" are the biggest concerns for the #crypto. It is about time exchanges strictly work security, than make money.  Cryptos also need Government regulations because of insider trading. Once this is done #Bitcoin will hit $20K within a month.

7217 2018-06-26 05:58:56 I just found a post from a leading crypto publication via Twitter. The tweet contained a tag to indicate it was paid for, which I missed 3 times. Yet there’s no mention on their site to indicate it’s paid for. 

How can we compete without giving into this unethical behavior?

7257 2018-06-26 05:52:06 Let me sleep on it get back to you in the morning. I'll write it down so I don't forget. It's a great idea I have a lot of crypto domains too. Can always acquire more. I have a site that gets a lot of traffic for crypto prices I could put into the mix. Tons of potential here! 
7258 2018-06-26 05:52:02 And yet people have been scammed because they want to believe that crypto is different. Like, say, the internet when it was young and “people didn’t get it”.

7264 2018-06-26 05:51:07 Imo crypto currency is not sustainable. Theyre fiat currency which value depended om another fiat currency (money). Dah la mining tu tak provide tangible output. Basically buy grafik kad byk2, set up and forget. They sit there and do useless maths, consuming power.

7285 2018-06-26 05:47:11 I would imagine the crypto people have been in it for a while have already committed themselves as far as they are going to go. The newbies will still be nervous to enter the market. It needs the institutions to kick start this.
7286 2018-06-26 05:47:04 Mmmmmm... that is true. I do feel like we should get rid of some too
7287 2018-06-26 05:47:03 The Bank for International Settlements’ economic adviser Hyun Song Shin says that crypto should be considered securities.

The good news is $BTC should not drop too much lower (maybe a quick dip under 5k) over the next 2 months. Then we have a bull run breaking $200k before the end of March 2019.

The bad news is I'm still pretty crap at reading charts.

7571 2018-06-26 04:52:19 1. I’ve always been under the impression that crypto assets would benefit bots more than humans. Since they are so volatile right now they are less than ideal for payments. Bots can overcome the psychological ups and downs of the market for starters.

7580 2018-06-26 04:50:59 このペーシングを行うことで人は無意識でも
自分と一緒だと感じ安心感を覚えるそうです。

つまり共通点を見つけるということです。
7581 2018-06-26 04:50:49 またペーシングには
声のトーンやスピード、呼吸を合わせることを「マッチング」
動作を合わせることを「ミラーリング」といい、
この２つの総称が
「ペーシング」という解釈になります。
7582 2018-06-26 04:50:48 いらんやろw

7584 2018-06-26 04:50:36 そんなとき簡単で役立ちそうな方法が

「呼吸を合わせること」

相手と呼吸のタイミングをあわせるという単純なことで
実は信頼関係が生まれてくるのです。

これを心理学の専門用語で「ペーシング」といいます。
7585 2018-06-26 04:50:25 それは、例えばお互い本音で語り合い、
お互いのことを深く知る、
ということですが、
そもそも
本音で語り合うまでの状態に至るまでが難しいわけですよね？
7586 2018-06-26 04:50:16 つまり「知る」ことができれば
安全を得ることができ
信頼関係の向上に繋がり
人間関係がうまくいくという図式です。

では、お互い「知る」ためにやるべきことは何か？
7587 2018-06-26 04:50:14 @TGasper95 aka Crypto Bob is the best unknown account on cryptotwitter. No one knows this. No one talks about this. Shhh. Dont tell them.
7588 2018-06-26 04:50:02 つまり、人が人間関係に悩むのは、
その対象を
「コントロールができないから」だと考えられるというわけですね。

であれば、、
コントロールするってどういうこと？
ということになるのですが、

これは言い換えると、その人を「知る」ということです。

7591 2018-06-26 04:49:49 理由として、人が子孫を残し、種として繁栄し続けるためには

7596 2018-06-26 04:49:10 Traders don't buy USDT. They are forced to buy it when they sell crypto into an unbanked USD account. If an exchange has $100m USDT reserves vs $150m USDT account balances, it's up to the exchange to balance its reserves, i.e., issue $50m more USDTs by using Tether's Merchant API

7718 2018-06-26 04:24:16 Falling at low volume means that it is not that significant. And bitcoin is back to $6,200 not.  Global average cost of mining is about $6,000.  Is this the bottom?  Probably, as bitcoin is global, but cost of mining in China is about $3,200.

7721 2018-06-26 04:23:56 1/ I think mass adoption of crypto will require one of three scenarios in order to happen:

1) A financial crisis close to what happened in 2008, where everyone finally is fed up with traditional banks/financial institutions.

Because we know that's where smart money wants to buy and where garbage coins will get crushed, and many coins need to go to $0, if we expect institutions to take crypto seriously long term

7859 2018-06-26 03:54:47 It is worth noting that despite the importance of real estate/mutual funds/index funds been the bulk of your portfolio for steady long term growth/preservation, by allocating just 5-10% in good quality $crypto will boost your future wealth substantially.
7860 2018-06-26 03:54:43 CBD. Meditation, exercise, real food, get a deep tissue massage. Craniosacral therapy can really oeel the kayers if tension away. Learn how to breath again, we all forget. Look at sources of discomfort in your life, put an end, or beginning, to something you've been avoiding.

7866 2018-06-26 03:52:21 So, does anyone know why my #ICX on @binance is showing a zero BTC value balance when I still have 290 ICX. Think my api messed up? I haven't logged into the website yet. Im going to try that, but just wondering if anyone else experienced that. #CRYPTO

7875 2018-06-26 03:50:40 How would that even work?
7876 2018-06-26 03:50:39 $Crypto will either make you or break you. You may meet some cool people along the way but remember, most have hidden agendas so always keep your eyes open and mind clear. If you find genuine, nice people, return the love but always stay sharp.
7877 2018-06-26 03:50:22 I know I can’t count on you 
7878 2018-06-26 03:50:22 I hit my heavybag.  Or go for run outside or on the treadmill.  Or I do something nice for others.  Wisest bit of advice from my greatest teacher ever...whenever you feel sorry for yourself, do something nice for someone else.

7883 2018-06-26 03:49:14 La moneda Tradicional como las crypto monedas son cheques al portador. A diferencia de la moneda Tradicional, la crypto moneda deja rastro. Eso no evitaría corrupción pero tiene gran potencial de evitar impunida creo yo.
7884 2018-06-26 03:49:10 Imo 3-5k USD (based on cost of production) per BTC likely to be the lowest price in our lifetimes going forward.

7886 2018-06-26 03:48:21 First stop down should be around $4500-5k. Will take some time to get to 3k, but i'm actually considering leaving crypto until that time to rebuy. Will be checking the charts though for any changes.

7905 2018-06-26 03:44:23 On average both are true. Hashrate follows a higher price (mostly speculation) and a lower price (mostly cost) follows hashrate.

2. You say they answer to banks.  You fail to explain how.  Back up your claim with facts.

7921 2018-06-26 03:41:36 Just because a #Crypto project makes you money, it doesn't mean it's a good project.

As an investor I look at some key things for the long term:
- The tech?
- Would I use it?
- Team?
- Progress?
- Working product?
- Active marketing?
- Competition?
- Partnerships?
etc.

7944 2018-06-26 03:36:22 Some advice I wish I heeded early on in #Crypto:
- Don't over diversify - Concentrate FIAT in projects you're confident in
- Measure success against $ETH & $BTC - if you made money but haven't outpaced those two, you're not doing it right
- NEVER CHASE A PUMP - look for the trend

7982 2018-06-26 03:27:34 CLAIM LBTC
The original bitcoin holders can claim LBTC at a 1:1 ratio if you held BTC in the wallet or the supporting exchanges at Bitcoin block 499,999.
7983 2018-06-26 03:27:18 One thing I liked is the offshore storage feature. It would be great for those wishing to accept crypto in a secure/private way. It allows businesses to avoid price volatility.
7984 2018-06-26 03:27:09 $SS Sharder.  It will take a long long long time.  Its a big ask of the crypto universe what they trying to achieve. May have the right people....but the approach of mgmt is great and tech makes total sense. If you know what SHARDING is....ah....learn it! DYOR

8004 2018-06-26 03:22:58 It's crazy how people expect free consultancy services just because the crypto space is new and relatively unregulated, fuck that shit I don't work for free.

8051 2018-06-26 03:14:47 I remember when I first got into crypto during the boom last year. I told myself to only invest what I could afford to lose. As the bear markets fears its ugly head, I don’t mind because I already knew I could lose it all. So there’s nothing to worry about now.

8065 2018-06-26 03:12:47 I agree that Intel's statement here is accurate and clarifying. I also think it is useful to point out crypto libraries which are written in this way (libgcrypt, based on what I know, is not, BoringSSL and OpenSSL both are).

8152 2018-06-26 02:59:04 the more i learn about @OrigoNetwork more &more getting excited. their protocol will enable parties to develop & execute smart contracts privately without revealing inputs & outputs. 

They scored investments from large #crypto focus funds.
8153 2018-06-26 02:58:54 The real reason why the crypto market has sunk is that financial institutions are coming. This is smart money, they are shorting the hell out of $btc to DUMP the whole market in order to find good entry points to load their bags. Once they do that, We gonna MOON.#bitcoin #crypto

8166 2018-06-26 02:56:41 In regards to the $TRX futures, I expect the price to immediately skyrocket. Think like a big player. Shoot the price up (liquidate shorts immediately, since most will be shorting), and then dump from higher. This is what I will be watching for.

It's vital new folks know which ticker symbol is the real #bitcoin (which for me is $bch).  As a community we need to make an absolute choice between $bch/ $btc ourselves to show leadership.

8255 2018-06-26 02:39:27 During bull markets you're best off buying & holding crypto.

During bear markets (now) your money is best spent on mining.

If you're always holding AND always mining, you're betting on crypto surviving & hedging your crypto bets, irregardless of what the market does short-term.

8279 2018-06-26 02:36:27 Apart from sex, MBK also focuses a lot on crypto.
8280 2018-06-26 02:36:19 Yeah seriously. I’ve joked with many of my nocoiner friends who believes I have no business being in this crypto game. I told them, “homeless or millionaire 2020”  and I’m leaning so hard towards the latter
8281 2018-06-26 02:36:14 ありがとうございます(´∀｀*)
メンタル大事にしつつ頑張ります
8282 2018-06-26 02:36:06 It's the product of that regular company that answers to banks that I mentioned before.  It's a back door for banks to maintain future centralization of currencys if it becomes the go to coin.  Just my opinion, if you're into it and see no probs, god bless, hope it works out.
8283 2018-06-26 02:35:58 Major exchanges only bro. There are shit coins and then there are shit shit coins. I dont do shit shit. LOL
8284 2018-06-26 02:35:34 already did. Several times
8285 2018-06-26 02:35:15 That shit was ass. I would of just said nah.

8287 2018-06-26 02:34:56 Lord save the plebs who are thinking "they are in crypto" when buying CFD's for cryptocurrency on eToro.
8288 2018-06-26 02:34:52 Does btc look like it's going to dump?
8289 2018-06-26 02:34:51 Side note i disagree they answer to banks.  Lets keep going.  Answer the other Q.
8290 2018-06-26 02:34:50 
8291 2018-06-26 02:34:47 You have a better grasp of the crypto underworld than I ever will have. Nice.
8292 2018-06-26 02:34:31 touch base
8293 2018-06-26 02:34:22 Remember guys all these charts are VOID if $BTC dumps. Trade carfully. Use stops losses.
8294 2018-06-26 02:34:22 No “you people” as in throwing everyone into the same group is just stupid childish, grow up
8295 2018-06-26 02:34:11 Great project. I see potential and a lot of future. A great team of professionals,who know their business!! #VIVA #VIVANETWORK #ICO #crypto
8296 2018-06-26 02:33:43 Some questions:

- what is a “crypto winter”?
- what do you mean by “stage, asset type, and geography”
- what do you mean by “non-speculative use case”?

8307 2018-06-26 02:31:17 Cool shit
8308 2018-06-26 02:31:16 I dont have an exact rule. it depends on so many factors like, how is BTC moving, is the coin on a run because of some news like fork or airdrops. Am I in front of the computer all day or am i going to bed, etc...
8309 2018-06-26 02:30:48 Yeah it’s pretty disgusting. Go take a look at kucoin’s chart though for more historical data. There’s some patterns in the past that are lining up pretty well. There’s definitely no clear reversal signs yet but it’s close IMO
8310 2018-06-26 02:30:45 So you are saying Ripple the company is centralized.  Great we agree.  Now tell me how XRP AND THE XRPL is centralized.
8311 2018-06-26 02:30:41 Hey tracktx, Thank you for the follow!
8312 2018-06-26 02:30:14 Can you also pay @lufthansa a visit when your done?. @lufthansa took my money and gave me nothing in return.  I guess to them it’s more important to steal $400 rather than keep a happy customer.  Disgusted and would tell everyone to stay away from them
8313 2018-06-26 02:30:13 Interesting way of putting it.
8314 2018-06-26 02:30:02 @nancygrant861 You know nothing of Bitcoin.. #BTX #TRX #Crypto
8315 2018-06-26 02:30:02 Considering my wife doesn’t care about crypto at all, this is the only place I get affirmation for my true hobbies. The internet helps connect communities of like minded individuals. It is always nice to know others see what I see; it is also nice to hear dissenting opinions.

8320 2018-06-26 02:29:32 Buy low, sell high. That's all there is to it.

The only thing that stops you from doing this is greed. Get a handle on that and start seeing profits.

1% gain is always better than a 10% loss because you got greedy. 1% a day adds up. #trading #crypto

8394 2018-06-26 02:16:15 驚いたな。それはZcashだ。そいつの上にビットコインを載せて、鋳造という工程を踏むと匿名通貨に変換できるぞ。取り出したい時は注ぎ込みという工程を踏んでビットコインに戻すんだ。俺の友達が一度実践してみたんだが、見事にビットコインが飲み込まれたまま取り出せなくなったらしくてな…
8395 2018-06-26 02:16:00 you may have hit your head harder than you think.
8396 2018-06-26 02:15:16 of course it always makes sense to sell if you know that. the point of investing in crypto is to accumulate more crypto. if you hold forever you dont ever accumulate more coins. if you sold btc @15k and bought back at 7.5k this year you now have 2x more btc. its pretty obvious

I would mention kraken but their trading engine was and is so they didn't bother.
8427 2018-06-26 02:09:09 Her seething hatred for crypto is palpable lol.
8428 2018-06-26 02:09:02 Are we able to transfer our TRX to the official wallet now?

8430 2018-06-26 02:08:35 Você já saiu de casa? Sabe o que é um batalhão de engenharia? Num momento de crise treinaríamos muita gente, teríamos certeza de obras feitas e no custo real.

8435 2018-06-26 02:07:30 If this is true, I can’t think of anything better than two coins joining forces for the #crypto community right now.

8438 2018-06-26 02:07:00 $1250 for two A3 miners and one S9 rig with everything needed to run. January 2018 batch. 9c kWh at my place. Worth it? #crypto #mining #bitcoin #litecoin #ethereum #Altcoin #antminer
8439 2018-06-26 02:06:36 I'm new to crypto, but to me it seems there are currently way too many scams to get a large number of people entering this space.
8440 2018-06-26 02:06:31 Yesterday, I could buy 1L of petrol at the #servo for AUD$1.35. 
Today it is AUD$1.60. Every week, it moves 20% overnight on Mondays. 
Why the volitility? Rarely does even #crypto shift so much in 24 hrs. Why the consistency? Who controls this pricing?
8441 2018-06-26 02:06:25 still adding?

8462 2018-06-26 02:03:25 I think we need to think hard about a sour future when (1) winner-takes-all means the winners have to subsidize the losers, (2) the winners have little in common culturally or racially with left behinds, (3) crypto and tech makes it harder to tax winners.

8556 2018-06-26 01:47:19 China's been accumulating Gold for a decade, most think to relaunch their currency gold backed, which I tend to believe. But if that happens, do you think that somehow makes the price of Gold go up? Or they knock off the USD which puts it into hyperinflation and then GLD to moon?
8557 2018-06-26 01:47:16 If we have 1 more wave down here before a bounce then I'm looking at the 7.8-7.85 area for a possible long scalp

If we already are on the bounce I was looking for then It's back to looking for shorts 8.2 or 8.3 have attention

8602 2018-06-26 01:37:13 Getting emotionally invested in one coin this early into crypto, is like losing your virginity in your teens and only having sex with that one person for the rest of your life.. choose wisely.

The price needs to increase in any of these coins to have the liquidity to satisfy a large market.Price increase discourages spending but not all cases of moving value, just novelty crypto shoppes.

8695 2018-06-26 01:17:51 It is unsafe to store crypto on virtually all exchanges as of now. I would recommend Binance for the buying, but then send it to a Ledger Nano S. This is a cold storage wallet disconnected from the Internet and can't be hacked.

8701 2018-06-26 01:16:54 Been on crypto a little over a year now, I can honestly say that last year this time when everything first started to dip I would have bought right away. Patience and being burned has taught me to wait and look for the signs to re-enter!

8717 2018-06-26 01:14:20 Every article for the last 6 months is how crypto is bouncing back after a bloodbath. What it fails to mention is that after every bloodbath, the high of Bitcoin is $1,000+ lower than before. The new top line is gonna be $6400, which drags everything down.

8724 2018-06-26 01:13:32 Trx ,  Tron is no longer in the top 10 coin list its now number 11 , Teather is number 10.
8725 2018-06-26 01:13:20 Your stoploss on this flight should’ve triggered long ago.
8726 2018-06-26 01:13:19 Crypto has been in a downtrend since january . Buying the dip is risky because no one knows where the bottom is. Waiting to buy the breakout of the previous high is less risky.

8735 2018-06-26 01:11:27 Planned exits and entries are ideal when entering a trade. However, always be ready for a potential BSBO in alt season. Breakouts are almost unpredictable and you don’t want to be the guy that sold at 50% gain on a  500% overall pump.

8738 2018-06-26 01:10:41 The a16z crypto fund looks more like venture capital for deep tech than a hedge fund for new volatile assets.

8748 2018-06-26 01:09:19 Most institutions simply strategically rebalance. Determine how much of your total asset allocation you want in crypto. If it booms and gets to be too high then take profits and put it elsewhere. If it busts then add to it to go back to your target percent.

8852 2018-06-26 00:49:39 @syscoin masternodes have use case extending well beyond "ROI generators".  Unique tech solving some long-time challenges of blockchain.  Talented team who has contributed multiple bug fixes and suggestions to Dash MN code (bounties collected).  Continual progress since 2014.
8853 2018-06-26 00:49:38 @senorLupe is the best thing to happen to crypto in this down trend.
8854 2018-06-26 00:49:25 Hindsight bias. Buy and hold will outperform most traders. Also depends are you short term? Are you long term? Absolute return? Total return? Trading vs investing are two different strategies. Traders aren’t truly in “crypto”

8865 2018-06-26 00:46:54 I think it's still up in the air, but I'm leaning towards cryptocurrency sticking around for the long term. I'm not certain what capacity, but the cat is out of the bag and I just can't see it going back in. #crypto #blockchain

8867 2018-06-26 00:46:44 "The value of the security is ultimately in the asset it represents (equity, profit share, real estate) - not the fact that it’s on the blockchain" -- 100% agree with this.

8891 2018-06-26 00:44:29 It's decidedly not. Acceptance of any crypto isn't even within the a few orders of magnitude of any major fiat you can name.

It's good to see a woman be in charge of this fund. Hopefully it will inspire more women to look to enter the crypto space.

8934 2018-06-26 00:37:07 People vastly underestimate the illiquidity and spreads in crypto.
8935 2018-06-26 00:37:01 “Universal money” is something that ppl can relate too. When ppl take trips, they have to pay fees to get it transferred from currency to the other. Also, sometimes they have to physically carry that transferred amount in their insecure wallets/purses in a foreign country
8936 2018-06-26 00:36:41 It also helps when a company holds > 50% of the supply. At the same time it's one of the worst things about $crypto. Fake "decentralization."
8937 2018-06-26 00:36:38 .@Energicrypto This is amazing crypto , come on join us if you want money freedom ^-^
8938 2018-06-26 00:36:33 Well said. If you're going to invest not only money, but serious time into the crypto game, you need to have outs. Hitting the gym is a good one. Eating healthier and drinking less are also biggies. Thanks for sharing. #crypto #blockchain #btc
8939 2018-06-26 00:35:58 Time to snipe some auctions for my surplus side business. Crypto not paying the bills right now. Got some medical equip up for grabs tonight.
8940 2018-06-26 00:35:55 If you're ballin on a budget and trying to make some money in crypto, go big or go home.  Sure you could bet on established large cap projects for  maybe a nice 2-3x  later this year.  But that's not why you're here is it?
8941 2018-06-26 00:35:53 4) When we speak of “tokenizing an asset” and somehow managing to avoid the expense of documenting the legal relationship or full compliance with, say, securities law, we’re not actually creating an asset. We’re creating a problem.
8942 2018-06-26 00:35:27 Big difference last year $btc was only known as this thing that was only going up, FOMO was just brewing, now crypto is known to retail as something that makes you lose money

8950 2018-06-26 00:34:12 2)  "Tokenizing without “securitizing” properly is like saying you want to use the gold standard but would prefer to dispense with the gold."
8951 2018-06-26 00:34:07 I gotta believe it will be on par with email, smart phones, etc, like you said. We probably can't even truly wrap our heads around it at this point. #future #crypto
8952 2018-06-26 00:34:05 These polls are always gonna be biased too. A good chunk of people are in crypto for the long run.  So there is a baseline long position. Of the market timers the vast majority are gonna be short.

8969 2018-06-26 00:31:25 Most ppl are not tech savvy and will zone out if we start saying anything technical. So “programmable money” will fly over their heads. “New money” sounds too ambiguous. “Unstoppable money” sounds too dangerous to get into. “Limited supply”...ppl will just hodl and not spend.

9018 2018-06-26 00:22:59 As my daughter says, “Chillax, Daddy-o.”  If one Bank is doing the Settlement, it sounds like a walled garden and dependent on the nostro accts being held in the respected countries.

As a technologist, I don't see much point to any of these projects (well, maybe xrp since swift is utterly shit.. maybe that's why everybody hates it!).

9080 2018-06-26 00:13:28 Now, this could that the bank(s) are keeping nostro accts for this purpose of settlement. This is not the Swiss Army knife of Ripple that can settle virtually any currency from any place on earth or on the moon so long as there is an internet connection.  Drop .

9111 2018-06-26 00:06:42 Whats your net worth in crypto?  Fiat net worth is fake printed valueless net worth.  If you don't own a crypto (any Ethereum based crypto will do), your net worth is zero.  Sorry folks, but I watched the Tai Lopez bitcoin investing video and it opened my eyes.

9131 2018-06-26 00:02:10 BTCが時価総額11.7兆円。XRP2兆円。BTCが200万になったとして、その時にXRPが800円になれば時価総額抜けるってことだけど、XRP基軸になれば有り得ない話ではない。BTC300万の時にXRP1300円って考えれば余裕であり得る！

9133 2018-06-26 00:02:05 In reality for the 'retail investor', any $crypto investmemt should be considered a long term hold. Longer investment terms smooth out volatility and crypto is exceptionally volatile.

9140 2018-06-26 00:01:08 yeah, 'finex is real bad with the buy/sell walls.
I watch stamp climb or drop fast, and suddenly a wall appears on 'finex.
it causes a wide gap between the exchanges which slowly closes as the wall builders arbitrage between their accounts.
