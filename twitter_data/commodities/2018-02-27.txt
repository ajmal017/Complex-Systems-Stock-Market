2 2018-02-27 23:54:07 I think it's typical that Latin America did not have a great levelling in 1910-70, because it was industrialising. What makes Latin America atypical is that its industrialisation was preceded by a commodities boom.

49 2018-02-27 21:09:03 Great I’ll have a read thanks. I am trying to get exposure to commodities and trying to find out which ETF or ETN can capture similar returns to a broad index.
50 2018-02-27 20:49:15 The market for specific #commodities can be easily manipulated by large players. Of course that they've finally set their sights on the small but hot and rewarding lithium market. Bring the price down and you could acquire some #lithium projects at a discount. Mind games as usual
51 2018-02-27 20:48:43 Commodities vs Reits or Gold might be swapped, but overall quite nice results. Of course more US and Mid/Small cap gives a boost, but it may be unrealistic for some investors.
Is there a difference between North America and Domestic Market ( US based market)? Thx & Greetings SC
52 2018-02-27 20:41:41 Great .Many thanks.
I´ve been teaking around a bit and most often come back to something like:
20% Large Cap, 12% Mid Cap,, 3% Small Cap, 10% World Value, 20% Europe (my home bias), 3& Pacific, 5% Emerging, 1% Int Bonds, 3% Commodities, 11% Gold, 2% Reit.

54 2018-02-27 20:38:23 Dunno but we certainly don’t want to show them our Dairy or farming industries. Or how we treat other sentient beings we share our planet with yet deem nothing more than commodities.
55 2018-02-27 20:37:40 Market through the 2020s. Every article agreeing with oversupply was from several different commodities analysts and lithium industry analysts who did not have any disclosed stake in any projects. Yes there were some institution reports, however the same people calling 4 huge 2/?
56 2018-02-27 20:01:57 As people we sometimes rush for commodities we don't need, sometimes patience is the key.
57 2018-02-27 19:53:49 No surprise. The TSX exchange is the largest resource commodities market on the planet, while the Liberals, with #climatebarbie, Justin Castro, and an oboe player, put up barriers to resource development in a country that has a bounty of resources.
58 2018-02-27 19:48:09 US crude oil futures settle at $63.01/BBL Down -$0.90 or -1.41% 
The price of crude oil is settling the day at $63.01. That is down -$0.90 or -1.41%. The rising dollar helped to hurt commodities like gold and oil, but both are off the lows (as is the dollar).

73 2018-02-27 18:40:26 Farm commodities are a fungible asset. It doesn't really matter that your specific crops don't get exported. The fact that someone else's do means there's not a glut of supply in the U.S.

80 2018-02-27 18:14:12 Los bancos chilenos han comenzado a dar opiniones sobre el precio de commodities desde hace ya un par de años, pero la verdad es que su visión es de muy corto plazo - por lo que dicen no parecieran ser expertos en precios de commodities.

88 2018-02-27 17:46:40 The state would be allowing a market to form. Which would be wrong, because low income individuals can't make meaningfully free choices when faced with severe economic hardships. The wealthy would never have to sell a kidney to pay for essential commodities.
89 2018-02-27 17:45:03 Entienden que lo de Xi Jinping eternizándose en el poder en China puede hundir la demanda de commodities hacia futuro?
90 2018-02-27 17:44:43 We would create a market by allowing it. While it's true that markets exist for other commodities when they're not officially sanctioned, organ transfer requires so many technical skills that you can't just go to some backstreet organ dealer.
91 2018-02-27 17:41:50 The expression 'cognizance' is used not only in the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, and the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, but also in many enactments, such as, Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and the Prevention of Corruption Act, etc.

101 2018-02-27 17:01:07 You don't yet understand the economic definition of "scarce."

A thing can be "scarce" and simultaneously decline in value and/or be very cheap, and still be profitable to produce.

128 2018-02-27 15:29:37 That's absolutely correct !!! One cannot have a single rate for all the commodities in India. This will only make essential commodities expensive while making luxury items cheaper.

131 2018-02-27 15:18:34 Films are commodities whether we're speaking about a franchise or an independent. This is all driven by money despite many of our desires to be that pure artist. If you want to engage in the industry you have to see your work as a commodity.
132 2018-02-27 15:09:28 Thanks for the info yet can not disagree much more to you... Even technology needs standarts to compare one to another, in this case BTC might not be used due to its transaction speed but it definitely will be used as a currency over commodities such as brent, oil, gold, silver..
133 2018-02-27 15:02:38 Real version: we live in a society that, while it's made some movement, still treats women as commodities and status symbols.

138 2018-02-27 14:46:07 Exactly.  Also farmed animals, "livestock", i.e. living commodities, are not a result of evolutionary success (nat selection=strengthen species, rid maladaptive traits) but of human meddling (genetic selection=weaken species, maladaptive) for the purpose of profit/production.

143 2018-02-27 14:36:12 GM folks! Markets seem a bit quite out the gate.  Im still leaning towards SPX down but could still see a bit higher before.  Looking for OIl/Gold- commodities to get a little whack if this USD can turn. I still think Longer-term USD sees lower hence my LT bullish com view.

178 2018-02-27 11:56:44 <cont 2.> really is not such things as “commodities”. Their are separate markets of corn, copper, cocoa, etc.  Do not belong in an index together.  HY is the same, too idiosyncratic for Beta/ETF/Index product.  The very existence of these products means something is mispriced.
179 2018-02-27 11:51:19 <cont 1.> Corn, Copper, Cocoa, Coffee and Crude are all commodities that start with C.  They really have nothing to do with each other.  But we put them in a “commodities” index and buy that.  Creates all kind of mispricing and distortions.  HY runs the same risk. <more>

199 2018-02-27 09:12:12 It will for certain commodities, but reduces demand and thus output for others because disposable income is the same / similar.
200 2018-02-27 08:52:22 It's not aloof left theory, it's strategic corporate practice to offer fetishized commodities as dangerous diversion, to supplant civic bonds to shared, progressive values like justice, which used to inspire new consumer constituencies. We must see citizens as under duress.

229 2018-02-27 06:13:07 Somebody explain that to Paul Ryan. All profits? I’m not sure it’s that straight-forward. Take the commodities exchange and parking tankers in international waters as an example.
230 2018-02-27 06:11:30 @SenFeinstein  Congress damn well knows the more guns @NRA gets bought, the more money their investors make on the industrial and precious metals commodities market on #WallStreet. It's about making profits $$$, not about 2nd Amendment rights. All about the money and wealth gain!
231 2018-02-27 06:07:19 There is going to be another sustainable wave of commodities growth over the next few years on the back of China + Asia growth says @BRICLab’s @MarcosTroyjo at #GBFLATAM2018 @dubaichamber
232 2018-02-27 06:06:17 Stop the game of GDP and data reduce the price of petrol and all essential commodities. Provide employment.
233 2018-02-27 06:02:02 I'm not sure if you say this in the video you sent the guy, but an important note is that co-ops don't remove surplus value extraction. They still must exchange commodities in a market, and make some sort of profit to reinvest in their business. That requires exploitation.
234 2018-02-27 05:59:29 I use Beenance. Honey commodities right?
235 2018-02-27 05:48:41 Anyone in the #grain world hearing more on the flooding in the US Midwest that's delayed shipments? Japan Ag Ministry said US Gulf Coast corn shipments delayed 2 weeks, may release supply from reserves #commodities @business
236 2018-02-27 05:43:52 Once major exchanges are regulated API feeds will eventually be licensed and routing orders to off-exchanges will be illegal like fx, stocks and commodities.

251 2018-02-27 03:33:07 Iron ore prices continue to rally. And the strength in other key commodities that Australia exports (LNG, Coal) should wash out all the bank trades on short Aussie Dollar.

254 2018-02-27 03:05:07 Reigns getting his ass chewed out is like Cena getting his ass chewed out for something. It’s just not happening. They’re just too valuable of commodities to be punished for anything. And even when they are punished, the punishment isn’t even that severe. #RAW
255 2018-02-27 02:59:02 They bought the cheaper commodities of the english and allowed their own manufacturing workers to be ruined.
256 2018-02-27 02:38:14 Se puede duplicar la producción de modo sustentable? Sí. Pero los cereales se han transformado en commodities en los cuales sólo se ven los $$$ que eso genera. Si la práctica fuera menos destructiva, el enfoque sería otro. A nadie le interesa el hambre. Con eso no.
257 2018-02-27 02:27:00 @AUThackeray @bmcmumbai - u all crib about inflation and prices of commodities, u know how much hike for parking charges in last two years? Is anyone talking about this?

258 2018-02-27 02:25:23 Commodities are the golf ball dimples of portfolio management. Negative value by themselves, but they somehow improve overall performance when added in.
259 2018-02-27 02:10:07 I am bullish commodities and most currency pairs others are not too lol 
260 2018-02-27 01:59:06 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth 
261 2018-02-27 01:56:35 Drivers,  maids and nannies are the cheapest commodities, most abused and exploited unskilled labor force in Nigeria today.
262 2018-02-27 01:38:35 Also, merely positioning something as money will not make it money. Fiat money is based on commodity money (though debased over time), and commodities were never positioned to be money by the creator of the universe.
263 2018-02-27 01:27:39 Still on the fence.   8 years to go to prove wrong this reference.    I don’t see bit coin defying common economic principles.   What would differentiate BC from any other commodities stocks or currencies.   As with all in early is good.  Hold and sell is harder.

"And we attract those rare commodities by our energy".

Nodding:

"The Law of Attraction is absolute meaning it exists whether an individual believes it does or not - as real as gravity I'd say."

"It makes sense".

276 2018-02-27 00:40:51 If the minimum wage of #18,000:00 was based on #65:00 per litter of petroleum which sells @ #200:00 at now, while the price of other commodities has skyrocketed by over 100%, the upward review of the minimum wage is a necessity.
277 2018-02-27 00:34:33 In countries ravaged by poverty or war - what we take for granted in terms of access to services & commodities are luxuries & the rights & privileges that we see as evidence of civilisation become casualties. I have a maxim -I always look upwards to attribute blame.
278 2018-02-27 00:26:09 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
279 2018-02-27 00:23:36 Yes madam, we are in the compulsion to increase the food commodities production. Can you found any new method apart from the precent one.we think that we are in correct path in our farm work process, any drop in't.
280 2018-02-27 00:22:56 Actually nothing. The US gov wants a cheaper dollar for exports. All countries do. The devastation happens when dollar rises and we get deflation. Also commodities trade in billions. Capital flows trade in trillions. Its all faith in gov.
281 2018-02-27 00:21:56 If the #1,800:00 minimum wage was based on #65:00 per litter of petroleum as planned, now that petrol sells at #200:00 and other commodities sells at twice or thrice prices. It (mp) calls for urgent review.
282 2018-02-27 00:18:31 Bingo. I do it for self-gratification. No different than over-investing in fantasy commodities I believe in.
