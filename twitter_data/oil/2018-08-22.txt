39 2018-08-22 23:57:14 I had a lady come in who nearly lost her dog because she was feeding it 4 tbsp of coconut oil a day.
She thought because its "natural" it wouldn't hurt her dog to give it 4 times a much as the vet told her to to help with its dry skin.
The poison is the dose people.
40 2018-08-22 23:57:14 Getting my oil changed but oddly feel like I’m in the movie Cars at the doctor’s office 
41 2018-08-22 23:57:13 I am a fifth gen farmer with a degree in ag economics. Business is cyclical. It is tough to buy retail and sell wholesale so diversifying into clean fuel. Big oil blocks us since they control mkt place. We lose money (no mkt) Consumers lose. Environment loses. Just let us in.
42 2018-08-22 23:56:33 I'm also very happy about this dva cinematic bc it makes me happy that I don't have to always do the pink arrows lol. like I'm so happy with the idea of just charcoal oil streaks on my face

48 2018-08-22 23:56:08 It's great for their coat and skin. Fish and fish oil is even better.
49 2018-08-22 23:56:02 I would use a local one because they tend to be fresher but I guess it doesn't really matter? (I'm in Australia so use Aussie ones. They vary). Do they produce olive oil in the US?
50 2018-08-22 23:55:51 Popcorn popper and popcorn. Magazine subscriptions. Printer ink the best though. Also Tide pods if not to scary with toddler in house. Basil infused olive oil. Good on the popcorn also everything else. Blender with quite cover from Hamilton Beach. Case of Cheerios.
51 2018-08-22 23:55:47 Not sure where this professor gets his information or facts, but coconut oil properly prepared has served the pacific nations for thousands of years, no brain damage, most of the top NASA scientist are Indians, Asians whom have consumed coconut oil

59 2018-08-22 23:54:59 Excerpt: Alberta’s Auditor General reported that the Alberta government is liable for up to $20 billion for cleaning up the oil sands mines alone. The Energy Regulator has internal estimates total cost of cleaning up all Alberta’s oil industry will run to $260 billion...

62 2018-08-22 23:54:23 there was an article on how coconut oil is a Very Saturated Fat and you probably shouldn’t eat much of it

and of course a person commented “bet the scientist was paid off by big pharma” in a completely serious way
63 2018-08-22 23:54:21 @AAAnews ...  I am writing about an exceptional auto care owner in Lewiston, Maine that assisted me when I damaged my oil pan on a Friday afternoon.  Bob Berube of Berube’s towed my car, examined the damage, sent for an overnight part and had it ready for me Sat morning. GREAT
64 2018-08-22 23:54:03 Yep! Those marks are where I got splashed with oil
65 2018-08-22 23:54:00 That's interesting. No idea why the men's would contain arrowroot and the women's almond/coconut oil; could be just aromatic differences?
66 2018-08-22 23:54:00 Exactly correct...the greasy wheel gets the most oil.  Personally I would play up the wonderful gift Cuomo gave us last week.
"America has never been great".
67 2018-08-22 23:53:55 The Clean Power Plan rollback will not only make the air dirtier but also cost Americans more. Lower mileage for cars means more gas to buy & increase  imports of oil fr other countries while dirty air makes people sick and can even kill them.
68 2018-08-22 23:53:50 Bolton has threatened to cut the Iranian oil exports to zero.

Are these two stories connected?

72 2018-08-22 23:53:44 Discuss that asshole who strangled his PREGNANT wife & two little girls, then hid their bodies in an oil tank 2 disguise the odor of decay!

Or the white father in Dallas who slammed his 16 month old son onto pavement, then finished him off by stabbing him in front of neighbors!
73 2018-08-22 23:53:29 Forget about the fuzzy possible future value of Oil & Gas revenues, instead investigate the very tangible past, specifically how Scotland has or has not benefited from such an enormous resource within union and how well that resource has been managed as an argument for indy.

75 2018-08-22 23:53:22 Is that fryer oil? OTL
76 2018-08-22 23:53:14 I concur. But now that this Administration has decided we no longer need to be in oil conservation mode, I was hoping we would no longer need to drill in ANWR.
77 2018-08-22 23:53:13 Does it rain sand there?? Haha is that why you have so much sand?? 

when your camels stop running do you pump them oil or do you have electric camels

79 2018-08-22 23:53:08 Usually pan fry or stir fry with olive oil until they have the same texture as cooked pasta. If you’re boiling them 2-3 mins and it’s done
80 2018-08-22 23:52:53 Okay, so a McDonald’s ad played before the actual video and I was so confused. I was thinking “what did McDonald’s do with coconut oil? Are they using that now?” Then it hit me. It’s an ad...not..about McDonald’s at all.
81 2018-08-22 23:52:42 I’ve kidded before, but I DO get that while olive oil comes from olives, baby oil does not come from babies. What about fruit flies though???
82 2018-08-22 23:52:42 Verla Insko & Valerie @FousheeforNC can be reasonably expected to voice objections to state water poisoning. We must understand that fracking forces do not care about our water or anything environmentally positive & only oil profits.

86 2018-08-22 23:52:20 This is not an unknown scientist at a dink college that needs publicity or money. They wouldn't risk their 300 year reputation of excellence by hiring someone who'd make an "iffy" report or have them publish it. So I'm pretty sure my life won't suffer without coconut oil.
87 2018-08-22 23:52:18 Did you mean castor oil? 
88 2018-08-22 23:52:16 Knew about the PMs, Gordon Browns first meeting after becoming PM was with fecking Murdoch or his representative, didn't know about the oil though. He is a despicable excuse for human though.. human is contentious I know.

107 2018-08-22 23:50:01 I'd love to see the coconut oil bubble burst.

I'm allergic as hell and it's creeping into EVERYTHING.

Since it's not a common allergen, makes it harder to avoid.

Then there's its evil big sister...palm oil.
108 2018-08-22 23:49:51 I never use coconut oil as food things. Rather use it for skin
109 2018-08-22 23:49:48 wow the hottest tatted guy is doing my oil change right now maybe my life isn’t all bad today
110 2018-08-22 23:49:45 Other cuntcerns include: Suspenision of habeus coitus, groing defictit, shortages of elicktrictitty, oil, and ass.
111 2018-08-22 23:49:41 Gasoline and automobiles are excluded by Stats Can due to currency fluctuations and tariffs. 

Oil is priced in $USD and automobile tariffs are assumed to be temporary until NAFTA is renegotiated, smart ass.
112 2018-08-22 23:49:34 This Newsweek tweet cites no evidence whatsoever and the video even says it's "believed" to block arteries. Can you cite any scientific evidence that coconut oil is unhealthy?

121 2018-08-22 23:48:10 Unfortunately the shithole countries have all the oil! We need to start investing in hydro, wind, solar power, etc. the only reason we haven’t (despite being perfectly capable of doing so) is because the continued use of fossil fuels brings the big governments more tax revenue!
122 2018-08-22 23:48:10 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
123 2018-08-22 23:48:05 @SZmembers TraderSZ, re your comment of oil ready to rip.  From the week's COT report, commercial buying would indicate that it has a few weeks yet before oil will go parabolically bullish but it is definitely cooking nicely :)

What about the American born killer of his pregnant wife and two daughters who disposed of their bodies in vats of oil? Are those ppl less dead because their killers were born here?

137 2018-08-22 23:46:34 Never used it. I use either EVOO or avocado oil.
138 2018-08-22 23:46:32 now we have people saying coconut oil is bad for us again. 

this is so stupid. 

people all over Asia have been cooking with it and using it for millennia, so it's not just Millenials rubbing it all over their bodies and calling it a health food as of late.

139 2018-08-22 23:46:21 I honestly like plain old almond oil as a moisturizer, especially in or after the shower. For hygiene products I like this anise toothpaste that the Dr. Bronner’s people make, and there’s a company called Shea Moisture that makes some really good soaps.

144 2018-08-22 23:46:14 Climate Change is abstract to all human beings as we still rely heavily on oil & even coal, we still drive petrol cars, we still conduct business as usual because the profane alteration of the planet's very nature is not flagrant enough for us to redraft society bottom-up.

154 2018-08-22 23:44:59 I'm convinced half the people in this thread have never tried it, or live in a state where all they can get is low CBD hemp oil. I've lived in WA and OR since cannabis legalization, and have used CBD oil for back pain, it works wonderfully with minimal psychoactive effects.
155 2018-08-22 23:44:53 That's one decision long overdue, but still have to have taxpayer pay  unless can find the revenue elsewhere. If oil revenues increase it might soften the blow.

162 2018-08-22 23:44:14 Why?  Because oil production is raison d'etre, end unto itself, & fetish for some geologists, academics, industry apologists, & "analysts". To say nothing of O&G companies & politicians. Adam Smith's invisible hand will win in the end - one hopes (as to a survivable climate).

217 2018-08-22 23:37:05 Oh nooooooooo! I'm thinking olive oil and a scraping tool of some sort? Is he super stuck?! 
218 2018-08-22 23:36:59 This "wall" has a much better chance of being built. 

I also find it ironic, big oil's decision to consolidate and concentrate much of their refining in one area (which has always been a dumb idea , except to make more profit) will get rewarded with more government largesse
219 2018-08-22 23:36:39 Well, clearly plenty of good quality conditioner and maybe some argon oil.

227 2018-08-22 23:35:25 So I watched gameplay for 11-11: memories retold, and I like it so far, and the oil painting inspired art style, but maybe experiment or tweak it a bit as not to be to bothersome to the eyes, to put it lightly. Other than that I’m excited for this story. Big VH fan.
228 2018-08-22 23:35:20 A study in the UK between two groups found the group using organic virgin coconut oil as a replacement to oil/butter had lower cholesterol than before they started over a month. The other group on butter, nope. Real reason for this story imo.
229 2018-08-22 23:35:17 Client stopped by earlier, got to talking about cancer. He mentions maybe it’s placebo taking place where I’ve seen ppl cured from cannabis oil. I got annoyed and almost asked if he thinks placebo was at play when my dog beat stage 4 cancer w/only cannabis. LOL

243 2018-08-22 23:32:57 Why arent we using this oil domestically to lower prices for US consumers?

279 2018-08-22 23:29:50 Not really, I sue a hair oil supplement but das it
280 2018-08-22 23:29:42 Hi.. since jps will reduce oil purpose and move to LNG what are your creative ways to stay profitable and increase profit? Any major project in the pipeline that will need financing ? DM please .
281 2018-08-22 23:29:38 @RayTRobinson @theterphouse avail at places that sell vape... tried cbd oil but my back pain was too severe.
282 2018-08-22 23:29:31 
Where's the baby oil?? Those boobs need some serious attention 
283 2018-08-22 23:29:31 I remember growing up eating porridge with dry uncooked onion because there was no meat or tomato and oil to make gravy

But today things are not best but not how they used to beGod's Grace upon each and every one who grew up in struggle and still does

#Don't give up
284 2018-08-22 23:29:19 I dunno, man. that sounds pretty reasonable to me. The In & Out burger tho...someone tap his veins for some oil.
285 2018-08-22 23:29:08 Eating at rubios in the patio while I wait for my oil change. Literally watched the pepboys employee take a quick unnecessary lap around the parking lot and gas it back into the garage.  I ain’t even mad bro just give me a discount
286 2018-08-22 23:29:08 I do and the ROI don't have our oil, our whisky, our fisheries, our farming. They have nothing the English want anymore. We have a balance of trade surplus and the UK are desperate to keep it.
287 2018-08-22 23:29:07 If coconut oil is so good for us why has it taken so long to become mainstream?  I’m not sure if it is good or bad or just a fad.
288 2018-08-22 23:28:54 Aye you tweaking I’m definitely a 2 speed 3 armor operator. I’m unique. My agent name is Oil I’m a defender and I put oil puddles that I can lite them or when people walk on them get hit with it
289 2018-08-22 23:28:54 awful.  matt, why won't 18-1/2" on the big island help with the spewing lava? (now i'm thinking it may be like water & oil???)
290 2018-08-22 23:28:48 In year 4 of its recession, war-torn Venezuela is seeing inflation rising to 1,000,000%, prices doubling every 26 days, oil being catastrophically depleted, and a mass exodus of its own citizens.

And you’re telling me AMERICA should try socialism?

Think again.
291 2018-08-22 23:28:42 Don't forget the majority countries that sell oil and rely on it's value are all non-whites but no worries those 0.000001% ceos that are white are the representation of every white person you find.
292 2018-08-22 23:28:40 Wild caught Cod seasoned with Alaskan lemon & lime sea salt(my sisters brought back from their trip) black pepper & paprika. Then I Sautéed it in extra virgin olive oil.

294 2018-08-22 23:28:28 Guess who had oil on her hair all day on Eid and even in pictures
295 2018-08-22 23:28:08 Nope.  It was Scottie.  Immature brat that he is. Watch him pour cooking oil all over the floor so House guests slip and lose time.  He plots coffee all over the stove and other nonsense.  Good riddance to him Thursday night.

299 2018-08-22 23:27:27 Poisonous coal and oil pollution is your favorite
300 2018-08-22 23:27:19 Not so educated r u
301 2018-08-22 23:27:18 Coconut oil - stable at high heat, tastes like shit, does nothing magical, total waste of calories.
302 2018-08-22 23:27:17 We must preserve the whale populations so that in a century we can start harpooning their rebounded numbers to light our oil lamps
303 2018-08-22 23:27:04 I will be tatless with you.. I can hear my mom.. I did NOT rub baby oil on you to keep your skin soft for you to go get all inked up!!
304 2018-08-22 23:27:04 I got a pedicure tonight, and the bitch put oil on my legs and feet. I slipped out of my flips flops at least 3 times walking to my car 
305 2018-08-22 23:26:49   See you this Boi...  I'm now sure you sip crude oil in private
306 2018-08-22 23:26:47 um no offense but i don't ingest coconut oil
307 2018-08-22 23:26:28 Motive matters
There’s an even longer list of murders committed here everyday by legal citizens, including mass shootings, serial killings and let’s not forget the guy who killed his wife and kids and buried them in an oil rig but go off sis 
308 2018-08-22 23:26:23 bitches put on hella baby oil & go stand in the sun, take pictures & swear they’re “glowing”  bitch you greasy 
309 2018-08-22 23:26:19 A4  drizzily olive oil yes yes  love butter but really love the taste of the olive oil yummm #lovewithfood
310 2018-08-22 23:26:16 And it continues to go downhill. When will people realize that trump is a con man. Hes going to allow drilling for oil in the Grand Canyon. He wants to drill for oil off the South Carolina and Georgia coast. But not Florida It might affect his property values.
311 2018-08-22 23:26:09 Just for starters we would not have WM allocated costs, Trident Allocated costs. We would have 3 more oil fields back. They are such liars please do not be sucked in. You can vote labour in an Indy Scotland. Let's get ther 1st.
312 2018-08-22 23:26:06 And to judge the oil oligarchs that bribed them to destroy the USA.
313 2018-08-22 23:25:57 They put all their faith in a shyster minister who probably sold snake oil in an earlier life.
314 2018-08-22 23:25:52 So the word is out on coconut  oil. Not as healthy for us as we think, due to its high saturated fat content. Better for hair and skin use.
315 2018-08-22 23:25:46 You’re going to love it, well, unless you really enjoy having to go out of your to fill up at a gas station, smell disgusting car exhaust, or change your motor oil every 5k-10k miles. Welcome...
316 2018-08-22 23:25:37 Might just have to poke a hole in my oil container thing so I can go back

320 2018-08-22 23:25:14 They were implying that Redbull kills previous clubs when purchasing them. I’m tired of hearing it like it’s slander. They’re owned by the Yanks and an Saudi oil sheik. Not exactly starting from humble beginnings. Hypocrites.
321 2018-08-22 23:25:11 Plethora means "many", you only cite one. What's wrong with lubricant anyway? Can't you program other machines to make lubricant out of oil and deliver it?
322 2018-08-22 23:25:03 My response is I think Saudi Arabia has a disgusting human rights record , they should be penalized and brought to a war crimes court in the Hague and face the ICC.  America should not buy oil or sell them arms or protect them
323 2018-08-22 23:25:02 anybody have keloid remedies that isn’t tee tre oil bc I don’t like the way that smells lol
324 2018-08-22 23:24:50 My mummy cooked oil down and yall can't speak to me

327 2018-08-22 23:24:34 OK how to I find out what my natural hair is? Wash day is actually OK now that I oil it and comb through with a wide toothed comb.

331 2018-08-22 23:23:33 I mean, the Harvard professor was simply pointing to the fact that SCIENCE, doesn't back up the any of the claims made by pro-coconut oil users.  She also states, coconut oil is extremely high in saturated fat which is heavily studied and peer reviewed and definitely causes probs
332 2018-08-22 23:23:28 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to USStates. I'll get a good price!
333 2018-08-22 23:23:22 Been fantastic to follow this and tweet back and forth with them at times during this haha.
334 2018-08-22 23:23:21 おいるさん、ありらじっす。

335 2018-08-22 23:23:19 I’d mainline coconut oil, over the water in Flint any day
336 2018-08-22 23:23:13 I really want to do an oil painting right now but like I have no oil paints
337 2018-08-22 23:23:08 It says they follow the money and power that resides in the USA approved Sunni system. Why did the Americans move away from the oil sands is a more interesting question?
338 2018-08-22 23:23:06 Grapefruit oil is underrated #essentialoils
339 2018-08-22 23:23:01 A snake oil salesman #LannyDavis just admitted on CNN it comes down Cohen's word against Pres Trump.....lawyers are liars. No evidence he said...
340 2018-08-22 23:22:51 First off who's eating coconut oil that much!? 2nd what are the effects of putting it in my hair and using as lotion?
341 2018-08-22 23:22:45 wtf why do people think fats are bad for you??? i used to take a spoonful of coconut oil everyday for seizure control and tbh it really helped
342 2018-08-22 23:22:38 Oil to fry plantain or dodo?
343 2018-08-22 23:22:36 @dera_pius see Lawrence brother

346 2018-08-22 23:21:52 I just bought a cool new Xbox One Scientology is the only true science! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

348 2018-08-22 23:21:51 He’s a travelling snake oil salesman....and they’re gullible yokels.  They deserve each other.
349 2018-08-22 23:21:32 My Dad still believes that coconut oil was originally demonized in order to kill off coconut oil production in the Caribbean & elsewhere - which would have been controlled by local entrepreneurs - & give the cooking oil market over to vegetable oil producers.
Plausible at least.
350 2018-08-22 23:21:17 I do not disagree that the bitumen should be refined in Alberta. By the way it is called "oil Sands" not tar sands.
351 2018-08-22 23:21:05 Hey wait a second. The Harvard dweeb said coconut oil was poison. He couldn't have been paid to say that by poison seed oil manufacturers, could he?!
352 2018-08-22 23:21:02 @StevieOkoye look at my twin brother 
353 2018-08-22 23:20:50 Sounds clickbaity to me. Haven’t seen any news reports of someone dying by coconut oil “poisoning”
354 2018-08-22 23:20:49 I am once again reminded that shipleys “coffee” is motor oil with caffeine
355 2018-08-22 23:20:45 Im so torn about Coconut oil!

357 2018-08-22 23:20:19 The most heated political debates among my family are about coconut oil.
358 2018-08-22 23:20:16 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
359 2018-08-22 23:20:16 they already get 5 TRILLION in SUBSIDIES each year worldwide...... so.... FUCK THE OIL INDUSTRY
360 2018-08-22 23:20:14 Omg, what a stupid stupid tweet. Without natural gas, oil and coal, people would be dieing of the cold or heat. You really are special lol
361 2018-08-22 23:20:12 yeah so, my redneck oil loving cattle ranching canadian province voted conservative for 40 years. then, we got annoyed with the entitled behaviour of the party in power, and elected the most socialist party we could find. go hard, texas dems. it’s your game to win.
362 2018-08-22 23:19:59 男の娘双子可愛いんですよね……持ってませんが……
363 2018-08-22 23:19:52 Bahaha Liberals are chasing all investment out of Canada, running record deficits. Had to overpay for a pipeline we could of had for free, buying 75000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia instead of building Infrastucture like energy east and using our own resouces
364 2018-08-22 23:19:52 Aku pernah pakein baby oil bisa hilang jerawat2 kecil gitu
365 2018-08-22 23:19:48 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”
- 2 Kings 4:7
366 2018-08-22 23:19:42 starting a gofundme to send anna delvey a hair mask and finishing oil to rikers
367 2018-08-22 23:19:36 Fair enough, but to date, in NA it has been a fairly one sided 'discussion' with the 'oil money/neoliberalist' crying & controlling false narrative, while some European nations r moving forward quickly understanding there will suffering  but substantial future
368 2018-08-22 23:19:28 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
369 2018-08-22 23:19:27 Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” and he said to her, “There is not another vessel.” So the oil ceased.
- 2 Kings 4:6
370 2018-08-22 23:19:19 For hair most the time you need to get amino acids into the hair shaft, so you don't want to coat your hair in oil.
Coconut oil tends to seep into every tiny hole in your hair shaft and disguise the real problem to act as a quick-fix; this won't help your hair in the long-run
371 2018-08-22 23:19:17 Gal can I...change me engine oil
372 2018-08-22 23:19:11 Is coconut oil what killed the dinosaurs?
373 2018-08-22 23:19:09 It's not Scotland's oil as long as Scotland is part of the UK, it's the UK oil. Scotland had a referendum which decided to remain in the UK.  All the leaders of the political parties signed an agreement saying they would respect the result. The SNP are charlatans.
374 2018-08-22 23:19:09 I love coconut oil!!  Mmmm. Moderation is key.
375 2018-08-22 23:19:08 I think the lady tried selling me when i was still loopy on anesthesia. I never used it. Just normal ass ice, turmeric, coconut oil, CBD and or hemp oil. Kept the inflammation at bay.
376 2018-08-22 23:19:07 with the oil.

380 2018-08-22 23:18:12 原因が特定できないので、とりあえず根気よく投稿してみてくださいb
381 2018-08-22 23:18:10 i was so confused by the sudden coconut oil boom: i was always under the impression that it’s awful as a food product. even as an asian i was told it was legit a junk food or good for hair. .....and that’s about it.
382 2018-08-22 23:17:54 So coconut oil is poisonous :/ I’m upset
383 2018-08-22 23:17:53 いっそホラーシーンだけ読み飛ばすか……ざっくり読めば大丈夫なはず
384 2018-08-22 23:17:50 How am i supposed to start with oil paints when everything is so expensive?
385 2018-08-22 23:17:33 So where is your outrage for Shanann Watts and her two daughters who was killed by their husband/father then dumped in vats of oil? Oh, yeah, he's a white guy so you don't care. #hypocrisy

389 2018-08-22 23:17:18 Well, lefties do say the Green Card is a tool of oppression...
390 2018-08-22 23:17:01 The first time I opened my mouth to speak

391 2018-08-22 23:17:00 You can tell how disconnected people are from reality when they outright dismiss the victim of a policy to defend that policy. The two Americas are becoming more and more real each day.
392 2018-08-22 23:16:57 real art is an oil painting of your wealthy patron surrounded by silver dinnerware, fine furs, and tropical fruit
393 2018-08-22 23:16:56 American people will continue to vote the way we have. Trump got in because of your actions over the last three decades. If you haven’t gotten the hint America first and that’s what we want. We the people are the Engine That keeps things moving. So change the damn oil.
394 2018-08-22 23:16:55 Did u even see lecture or read research report? What's this lynchmob mentality in science as well?

Prof was claiming link between certain fats (found in coconut oil) n cardiovascular. If u hv evidence to counter, show it!

Btw did u forget prevalence of heart patients in India ?
395 2018-08-22 23:16:52 On the grill, little olive oil and sea salt.... pull them off and drizzle with balsamic reduction 
396 2018-08-22 23:16:47 I am an accountant and all the losses i.e. deficit comes from UK allocated costs. By their nature they're not accurate nor necessary in an indy Scotland. Also a massive part of our oil revenue is English cause of how they stole our waters 1999. GERS are a joke propaganda tool.
397 2018-08-22 23:16:31 I don't believe that horrendous crap. The medical community will stop at nothing to lie to the people about the so-called bad benefits of using coconut oil. Give me a break! The medical community/govt. has done nothing but to make people sicker and feed them bull shit LIES!
398 2018-08-22 23:15:49 Since when does ole snake oil give the president orders on what he should do or not do!!!
399 2018-08-22 23:15:46 Having read your alarmist tweets about "crude oil products equaling Satan equaling global warming (!) i realize there is little reason to fear that you will mislead many.  i only have a BA in Theology, but it beats an MA in false witness every single time.
400 2018-08-22 23:15:43 Yup I also oil pull with it. It’s wonderful 
401 2018-08-22 23:15:40 I think the point is if we know it isn’t the best type of oil to consume, maybe we can treat it like we do other “bad” things. If you eat a little every once in a while, no big deal. I study cardiovascular disease and I’m still using coconut oil in my granola bars.

412 2018-08-22 23:14:03 not fake news..I agree with that - I nearly died from it.. was told it was "healthy " & tried it, not allergic to coconut in any other form or have any allergy to other foods.  Olive oil is healthier for heart & cooking & will not make you want to go to emergency room.
413 2018-08-22 23:14:02 Let's start with the activist's favourite starting point. Any document that starts introduces the project with the term "Texas-based oil and gas company"...is bound to have issues. 2/
414 2018-08-22 23:13:58 You want to dash me N1M? Do you see why I called you a bloody thief? Don't worry, even an oil well won't stop us from calling all of you out as the thieves that you are.
415 2018-08-22 23:13:52 In the past two years oil and gas leases provided $166million in K-12 education. Also, school isn't free daycare.

430 2018-08-22 23:12:00 Honestly? A useless collection of words. The breakdown of this country has nothing to do with drop in oil prices. No other OPEC nations became #FailedStates like #Venezuela #Maduro & regime have stolen massive qty of cash & stashed offshore #SocialismKills #MoreSanctionsNow
431 2018-08-22 23:12:00 I find it very hard to believe that Mr. France is so completely unaware of his core audience to do something this stupid.

It makes no sense.

442 2018-08-22 23:10:43 Yes I do use coconut oil in cooking. Just plain fear mongering. Baka they are just afraid coconut oil is overtaking their canola oil in sales na.

445 2018-08-22 23:10:22 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
446 2018-08-22 23:10:20 A lot of black people use coconut oil. So I knew the recent negative views was pure bs lol
447 2018-08-22 23:10:19 Nope a d are they oil tanks beside you....
448 2018-08-22 23:10:11 I’ve been trying coconut oil to treat one of my dog’s hot spots. It cleared one up in a few days. Would definitely recommend and isn’t as messy as you’d think.
449 2018-08-22 23:10:09 Lol you trying to eat healthy but cooking with hella oil.... 
450 2018-08-22 23:10:03 @indystar what is your problem? Where did the hate for coconut oil come from? Someone from the Canola industry slide you some bucks to print this garbage? EVERYONE loves coconut oil and knows the benefits no matter what crap you publish. 
451 2018-08-22 23:09:55 Just looked into this matter and it's quite the joke.  So far all of the links associated with this just show how far in the past these people (the journalists and this professor) are stuck with regards to nutrition.  Uggh....coconut oil is not pure poison
452 2018-08-22 23:09:47 The people of British Columbia should sue the big oil companies and carmakers for knowingly causing climate change and the terrible health effects caused by this summers acrid smoke.
453 2018-08-22 23:09:41 I think a lot of Californians are demanding to know why they are living in tent cities and could give crap about big oil right now. It is important, but there are more pressing issues for the Golden State- use your platform for that.
454 2018-08-22 23:09:40 you are SET. saute your garlic and some red pepper flakes if you have them in a bit of oil, add your bottle of red stuff, temper with your salty umami business and you're good to go.
455 2018-08-22 23:09:39 uuhhhh why is everyone saying smth abt a song produced by coconut oil???
456 2018-08-22 23:09:37 It's click bait. The simple fact that he recommends eating canola oil (which is super toxic) shows he knows nothing about nutrition.
457 2018-08-22 23:09:32 This exactly why I eat coconut oil by the spoonful.
458 2018-08-22 23:09:23 Coconut oil is supposed to be used for your hair and skin
459 2018-08-22 23:09:22 Lol KarenCanola, you're so full of it.  Coconut oil is natural unlike man made refined oils you're pushing for.  Google the history on Canola oil in the USA

462 2018-08-22 23:08:58 for me, i mainly eat a sorted amount of cruciferous veggies (80% by volume). i fill most my calories from organic extra virgin olive oil, avocado, coconut oil, cod liver oil, wild caught sardines &salmon, grass-fed beef, grass-fed butter, aged grass-fed cheeses, nutritional yeast
463 2018-08-22 23:08:52 Dude I don't use coconut oil...way too much saturated fat.

465 2018-08-22 23:08:46 Truffle oil was the sesame oil of 2017, and I am over it. Everyone stop.
466 2018-08-22 23:08:36 Let me oil pull even more!
467 2018-08-22 23:08:32 usually rinse my face w water and moisturize with vanicream. sometimes i mix argan oil with the cream. and every 2 or 3 days ill use neutrogena black head scrub in the shower
468 2018-08-22 23:08:29 Just checking Norway..seems their debt is covered by Oil fund..what the surpluses like eh?

Why is Scotland (i will give you UK if you like) one of only 2 oil producing countries in the world without an Oil fund again?
469 2018-08-22 23:08:28 He’s a snake oil salesman!! Slimy to the end!  Trump needs to get out of the Wite House!!
470 2018-08-22 23:08:28 Oil constitutes about 95% of Nigeria's general revenue.
471 2018-08-22 23:08:13 There's a reason why I don't ever make onion rings or fry poultry in my home...I can never get the oil temp right and the place heats up so much and smells like grease for two days...but I was craving that shit. Never again, tho. Now I gotta clean this mess.

474 2018-08-22 23:07:55 Fuck and i thought coconut oil was poison
475 2018-08-22 23:07:44 Stop offshore oil drilling NOW. THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA! It’s time to dump filthy fossil fuels. We are destroying our planet for the GREED of a few. Renewables is where we need to focus. NO MORE DIRTY ENERGY
476 2018-08-22 23:07:37 I need to get my oil changed lol
477 2018-08-22 23:07:30 We gonna have to call them Karen Canola!
We all know Canola oil is bad for you even though it was supposed to be the best thing when it replaced saturated grease like Crisco back in the late 80s
478 2018-08-22 23:07:29 Arsenic is pure coconut oil

480 2018-08-22 23:07:23 It's some German scientist who gave a lecture about it. It's all about fatty acids, really. Some are good, others not so much. We already know Palm Oil is bad, so much so that consumers in my country refuse to use it. I don't know about Coconut Oil, though.
481 2018-08-22 23:07:22 I'm wondering if the authors family grows canola, olives,
   or some other oil producing crop
and fears losing market share ; )
482 2018-08-22 23:07:15 what’s an good oil for dry skin?
483 2018-08-22 23:07:10 Yes! Skin be flourishing and all with the Shea butter. Coconut oil dries my skin out.
484 2018-08-22 23:07:05 EXACTLY! I would love for this guy to explain to me how this poison hasn't killed me over the last 11 months I have been on the ketogenic diet, lost 46 lbs of fat, 10 inches off my waist, and feel better than I ever have - all while putting MCT oil in my coffee EVERY DAY!
485 2018-08-22 23:07:04 if u can find any vegan mayonnaise that tastes good, aldi sells garlic oil and garlic flakes really cheap nd u could mix that in! not the same as the real thing but might work in desperate times
486 2018-08-22 23:06:55 We export food. We don't import it.  We are energy independent.  We don't  NEED to buy oil from any1.  Higher prices are thanks to Wall Street manipulation.
487 2018-08-22 23:06:52 Of course. It’s probably anti Trump to eat coconut oil. It is Harvard after all.
488 2018-08-22 23:06:43 Cash money to put a quart of oil in it every 50 miles.
489 2018-08-22 23:06:33 A simple garlic olive oil and veggies makes me happy too though.
490 2018-08-22 23:06:24 I don’t believe this. It’s a natural food/oil and if used in moderation I think it’s fine. Just my opinion.
491 2018-08-22 23:06:23 Call me crazy, but I feel like calling coconut oil “pure poison” is so over the top that I’m not actually going to believe you.
492 2018-08-22 23:06:09 Oh I have fish oil and whorcheshire , that’s basically the same thing
493 2018-08-22 23:06:09 Where am I gonna get clove oil??
494 2018-08-22 23:06:06 Something that conditions without being too greasy or making my local loose  Right now the best shampoo has been Dr. bronner's but a daily or bi-weekly conditioner has been hard to find. Right now I henna every four weeks with a healthy dose of coconut oil.
495 2018-08-22 23:06:05 Oil scalp massages (doesn't matter which - it's the stimulation that does it), Biotin supplements and a protein rich diet.
496 2018-08-22 23:06:01 Really? Last I heard there’s new deposits being found every day and peak oil may be a myth.
497 2018-08-22 23:05:50 You realize they've sold oil to the Syrian regime? You realize the majority of speicher massacre victims were Sunni Muslims? Look up what ISIS terrorists did to albu nimr tribe.
498 2018-08-22 23:05:48 coconut oil?
499 2018-08-22 23:05:29 I been using coconut oil for years , I cooked my vegan meals and use it  in my smoothies, and I’m extremely healthy person no health issues love coconuts 
500 2018-08-22 23:05:28 Price controls, expropriate businesses, an economy dependent on oil. But ofcourse it is always the US.
501 2018-08-22 23:05:13 wow, i leave the internet for two hours and coconut oil gets cancelled
502 2018-08-22 23:05:08 Nancy you can always give Iran billions of dollars for their oil and better yet deliver it in the secret of night with cash much as  Democratic hero  @POTUS44 did years ago. Time to dump the Democrats and go with a president to make America great again!!  @DonaldTrump
503 2018-08-22 23:04:53 Not surprised. In the late 80s I had hard time finding decent olive oil. Now there is easy and comes from everywhere. The only issue is authenticity.
504 2018-08-22 23:04:46 Highlight of my night has been watching james down the seperated oil from an old tub of peanut butter because I yelled tgf do it and then proceed to spew into his glass of milk while trying to wash it down.
505 2018-08-22 23:04:43 Coconut oil is wonderful. Almond milk vice normal milk is great as well
506 2018-08-22 23:04:32 Same here! Im glad it isn’t just me. I’m in humid swampy ass DC and still had dry skin. I just switched to almond and grape seed oil with lavender.

509 2018-08-22 23:04:13 The quick stop oil lube by Walmart.
510 2018-08-22 23:04:12 If it's the coconut oil then same
511 2018-08-22 23:03:57 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
512 2018-08-22 23:03:53 coconut oil?
513 2018-08-22 23:03:47 Which is where 85% of palm oil is grown.
514 2018-08-22 23:03:30 If coconut oil is pure poison, then I would never have survived the ~20 or so coconuts I nommed during my vacation in Fiji.

Also, FRESHLY CUT COCONUT IS AMAZING!
515 2018-08-22 23:03:30 Where do you want to start with all his criminal acts obummer is a snake oil salesman
516 2018-08-22 23:03:29 I need to start registering as an adult that no amount of weed and CBD oil can fix every medical issue and my first thought shouldn’t always be “Ow this really fucking hurts I need to smoke” but this is where we are.
517 2018-08-22 23:03:08 pure tea oil is magic stuff so if ye have any infections on the skin i fully recommend it :)
518 2018-08-22 23:03:06 Im speaking about the Saudi Kuwaiti Pipeline Hillary invested $4 million in, that would run through the middle of Syria if Assad approved it. This would kill Syrian future oil business.
519 2018-08-22 23:03:02 I deadass went to get a oil change and the man checked the oil and was like oh my god ... you know you’re way past due ? I’m like I know . Had to flush it and everything

526 2018-08-22 23:02:27 A dualistic view of Cairo. It's mostly oxford blue in color, it smells like oil, and it's actually a houseboat.
527 2018-08-22 23:01:45 “I can smell the heterosexuals, it smells like motor oil and axe body spray”
528 2018-08-22 23:01:34 Since the engine was build from the oil pan up to be a turbo motor, I doubt there were any normally aspirated runs.

542 2018-08-22 23:00:16 this don’t affect us becuase we know not to eat coconut oil, we just put it on our skin, hair, nails, clothes, soul etc.

552 2018-08-22 22:59:07 A white American man in Colorado murdered his entire family (including his pregnant wife). He worked in the oil industry, so odds are, he was GOP. (Crickets from Cheeto)... This is just racist bait for his racist base.
553 2018-08-22 22:59:05 I consume a bowl of coconut oil every day

557 2018-08-22 22:58:43 We South Indians consuming Coconut Oil every day for the time immemorial generations after generations my grand father lived 98, grand mother now 92.

My father changed to chemically refrained oils as per his doctors advise but he died at 48.
558 2018-08-22 22:58:31 Other things are "mined" besides energy (oil, gas & coal). Mica, feldspar, quartz, olivine, granite, marble, sand, gravel, etc.
559 2018-08-22 22:58:30 Yes, because the US opposed actions on climate change for decades, and the oil industry has launched an extensive misinformation campaign to prevent any action.
Maybe these 2.5 billion people wouldn't be relying on coal if the US actually invested in solar 40 years ago.

566 2018-08-22 22:57:37 A recent study found that coconut oil is worse for you than butter. I suspected as much. You’d have to be cocoNUTS to think something that tasty could be good for your health 
567 2018-08-22 22:57:35 You would sooner see a mile long railway crash loaded with oil?
568 2018-08-22 22:57:31 今日も生きる！今週体調悪すぎて昨日なんか10時に寝たけど起きたら世界がバラ色に変わってるから今日も生きられる
569 2018-08-22 22:57:26 Now this proves to me what an amazing, even miraculous oil, coconut oil is! Never stop using it. Just make sure you use a clean brand, organic and cold pressed! :)

571 2018-08-22 22:57:17 Since coconut oil is pure poison now... my whole life is a lie.
572 2018-08-22 22:57:15 Haha I had a snake oil salesman pitch me a bracelet like a fitbit on a plane ride to Cali for TwitchCon last year. She was being so friendly the whole time, then pulled out that book to read...right in front of me. I was astonished at her inability to realize how bad that looked.
573 2018-08-22 22:57:10 When I first read "The Coconut Oil Miracle" years ago, I 1st opened a random page & it said that soybean industries (Monsanto is 1) started a smear campaign against Coconut Oil b/c animal testing found it made them healthy & lean. That scared Monsanto b/c they also make Rx drugs.
574 2018-08-22 22:57:07 I am a DIGITAL MARKETER and also a GRAPHICS DESIGNER and I can use 'any tool you want or can afford'....Contract me. You'll not regret it.. I'm not depending on oil money  #lazynigeriayouth. Please help me Retweet because, my patronizers are following you....#help_my_career
575 2018-08-22 22:57:07 So I’m just got my oil changed and the owner went ahead and got hair transplants.....

577 2018-08-22 22:56:59 From my experience and of some people I know, coconut oil is either the worst, or the end all, be all holy grail of oils.
578 2018-08-22 22:56:54 If only we owned the oil. Sorry but what part of the free market has people confused?
579 2018-08-22 22:56:40 Oil change then hot pot 
580 2018-08-22 22:56:39 Area under cattle in Brazil has decreased in the last two decades. Cattle do move into recently cleared areas because that's the cheapest and easiest enterprise, but over time more land is converted to soy, oil palm and sugarcane.
581 2018-08-22 22:56:38 it makes my stomach turn that US elected officials caused 10 million homeless refugees to flee into Europe, US, and other countries,  so many destroyed lives across the world, so much destruction in the 7 country's US has invaded for the sake of their almighty dollar, oil, gold
582 2018-08-22 22:56:34 This is due to economics and infrastructure as well - for example China airlines does 1400 flights weekly to 102 cities across Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. An Irony with Nigeria as an oil producing nation, fuel should be a cheaper component regarding travel fare.
583 2018-08-22 22:56:34 Keep doing what you’re doing. Folks have been using coconut oil since forever.
584 2018-08-22 22:56:33 Tell me about it, I was there for 6 months in the early '80s.
When, incidentally the US tried to kill Gaddafi, suffice as to say all the cars were French and the Italians were more than visible re: Oil, not forsaking the Roman ruins.
Same old same old.

自分は、SSが見れるまで根気よく投稿しておりましたw
586 2018-08-22 22:56:22 Do you recommend eliminating coconut oil from our diets entirely, or just being reasonable about consumption?
587 2018-08-22 22:56:19 Listened to BBC reports today of tens of thousands leaving Venezuela ~ the Socialist paradise much praised by Jeremy Corbyn - the biggest oil reserves in the Western World but Socialism brings them to starvation!
588 2018-08-22 22:56:17 They live only in Malaysia on palm oil trees!
589 2018-08-22 22:56:15 Remember, they offered to share the oil, which Menem accepted.  And then Kirchner reneged on.
So you get nothing.  Not a drop of oil or a mouthful of fish.
590 2018-08-22 22:55:59 Coconut oil is definitely not worth the hype...
591 2018-08-22 22:55:56 Girl I work with: I just read that a Harvard educated doctor says coconut oil is bad for you.
Me: Guess anal is out then.
592 2018-08-22 22:55:40 Venezuela is a bastion of Socialism. Crisis has caused avg citizen to lose 25 lbs, 1,000,000% inflation. 2.3M fled country. Rich w oil, her people are starving.
593 2018-08-22 22:55:39 It's all avout marketing. What needs to be sold at the time is "healthy" in the 60s Americans came to the Caribbean and told the locals to stop using coconut oil because it's unhealthy. Corn oil or sunflower oil is healthier they said. Because that's what they had to sell
594 2018-08-22 22:55:32 Don’t think I’ll ever go back to a dealership for an oil change again, the take 5 in OP is awesome 
595 2018-08-22 22:55:30 Working together does not mean threats to shut off oil to BC or trying to kill BC wineries by not allowing them into Alberta.
596 2018-08-22 22:55:29 I’ve read before how bad coconut oil is for you
597 2018-08-22 22:55:26 @RealDoctorMike Did you see recent debate on coconut oil being poison? What are your thoughts?
598 2018-08-22 22:55:19 WHY PATANJLI GROWTH GOING DOWN ? SWAMI RAMDEV CREATED AWARENESS AMONG CRORE OF PPL THAT PALM OIL IS WORST FOR HUMAN HEALTH,BUT THEMSELVES MANUFACTURE BISCUITS IN PALM OIL..DO YOU THINK  JANTA  ITNI BEWKOOF HAI THAT THEY WILL STILL GO FOR PATANJLI ?@yogrishiramdev @Ach_Balkrishna

601 2018-08-22 22:54:45 White here is no tomato sauce and only garlic, ricotta, mozz, olive oil.
Also Ace meetup tomorrow!
602 2018-08-22 22:54:44 hoping hubbys work has some old stock of the old style baby lotion since they changed to a coconut oil formula. 

if they dont I am going to try their new Newborn cottontouch formula or the shea and cocoa butter formula. 

the generic store brand was a bust, my skin burns
603 2018-08-22 22:54:42 Got a bit of adulting done today... got Shiloh new tires and an oil change.
604 2018-08-22 22:54:16 Harvard professor calls coconut oil 'pure poison'
605 2018-08-22 22:54:06 Where's your outrage of the Colorado American citizen that murdered his pregnant wife and two little girls and put them in oil tanks. Murder is murder no matter the nationality or status.
#MurderIsNotPolitical
606 2018-08-22 22:54:03 I see something mentioned about cocnut oil, of course you have to find out for yourself.I am not assuming .................
607 2018-08-22 22:53:58 Oil is a sealant. It’s best to use a moisturizer first & then use the oil to lock the moisture in.
608 2018-08-22 22:53:38 I just find it awful that he’s supposedly this man of great ideals and he’s working w snake oil salesmen.
609 2018-08-22 22:53:32 Snake Oil salesman much.
610 2018-08-22 22:53:32 “How much oil you say? Well buddy it got the US govt’s attention. They sent in a USMC recon team to check things out and see if we needed invadin’”
611 2018-08-22 22:53:31 Oh yea, I’ve done my research lol usually when people lose hair from coconut oil it’s because their hair wasn’t “damaged” & now has too much protein. It’s common with any hair treatments that deposit protein or fats to the hair. Ya know, too much of a good thing blah blah
612 2018-08-22 22:53:22 someone sent me the oil diffuser i had on my amazon wishlist. i’m soooo happy  i’m blending peppermint & lavender tonight so i can finally get some real sleep.
613 2018-08-22 22:53:15 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! I was gifted Zen and have already purchased more!
614 2018-08-22 22:53:09 do you want oil based or coco butter
615 2018-08-22 22:53:08 Just got all my CBD oil back in stock.
616 2018-08-22 22:53:05 Oh please. It’s just as insidious as people not taking care of their vehicles that leak oil that runs to the waterways but I don’t see you stopping cars on I-80 and checking them. We’re talking one pickup bed load per year. SUCH A MASSIVE ISSUE 
617 2018-08-22 22:52:52 got so much coconut oil in my eye and now i’m blind
618 2018-08-22 22:52:46 "Land expropriation by Iran is so widespread that it has dispossessed Arabs of their land" Amnesty International 2006 90% of Iran's oil comes from wells in Arabistanis. An Iran without Arabistanis is an Iran without oil!!!
619 2018-08-22 22:52:44 No-one championed money-printing or hyperinflation; what people liked was Venezuela was actually using its wealth to help people. The problem it faced was over-reliance on oil prices, not to mention economic sanctions by the US designed to destroy its economy.
620 2018-08-22 22:52:35 YES HELLLLOOOO!! Mix coconut oil with castor oil and your hair will Rapunzel length. Leave it on your hair overnight at least once a week
621 2018-08-22 22:52:33 Why? We have oil whisky engineering farming and fishing. An Indy Scotland is rich beyond its dreams. No HS-2-3-4 No trident no wars no House of Lords and no more Westminster robbery.
622 2018-08-22 22:52:22 Si me paso durante 12 años K,es mas me sentí mas tonto cdo la afip nos perseguía a todos por un mes d mono tributo atrasado y por otro lado le perdono 8000 millones a C Lopez con oil combustibles, o q se inauguraban obras fantasmas con mis impuestos y los KK se la llevaron toda
623 2018-08-22 22:52:20 Thanks for this! Will definitely get this. We're also giving her MCT oil and something called "Companion 60"
624 2018-08-22 22:52:19 what I learned today: 
wear a shirt when cooking with oil
625 2018-08-22 22:52:16 Can you imagine if we had a real leader like PC Harper instead of sock puppet. We could have been part of the best economic years and oil riches that would feed a great social agenda. Instead higher taxes, fake climate taxes and good trade policies.
626 2018-08-22 22:52:16 This was a very lucrative business that they abandoned and were thus not exploiting. People complained that they wanted after sales services. It was realised that by doing a simple scheduled maintenance like oil, filters and spark plug change would prevent unnecessary breakdowns.
627 2018-08-22 22:52:15 Futures based ETFs rejected. They only makes sense when the underlying is extremely difficult to transact (gold, oil, comodities). Bitcoin is the most easily transactable asset ever created. Futures-based ETFs don't make any sense and an ETF should be based on the underlying.
628 2018-08-22 22:52:15 You should never cook with coconut oil. Never it to be consumed raw
629 2018-08-22 22:52:12 I recommend the Bona® mop or maybe a nice oil diffuser with some relaxing scents.
630 2018-08-22 22:52:07 That's the rubbish gift, the other one is better. I use that oil from hair to toes.
631 2018-08-22 22:52:02 Tomorrow, I'm putting a double scoop of coconut oil in my coffee
632 2018-08-22 22:51:59 10 for the oil filter and only k and n for the air
633 2018-08-22 22:51:52 ooh okay, if you had the chance, id try to get a deep conditioner or hair mask. I can give you so many recommendations lol i went through the same thing. the ONE thing though ive heard cons about coconut oil and it is the cause of hair loss so i don't know how safe it is really
634 2018-08-22 22:51:51 Oil Spillage? Mr. Lova Lova!
635 2018-08-22 22:51:50 A packed house at the CBD Oil seminar.
636 2018-08-22 22:51:48 Had a feeling the stamens they used eVerify was total BS.
637 2018-08-22 22:51:26 Castor oil is amazing
638 2018-08-22 22:51:23 Technical difficulties, oil dependency, political latency. Many reasons. But it should happen tomorrow.
639 2018-08-22 22:51:22 Lmao bc the lexus had its issues i learned how to do the oil, coolant & power steering. I'm still tryna master the breaks & tires, lol

641 2018-08-22 22:51:17 It's just more fear mongering every thing is bad for you. at some point you just have have a brain and live your life. Id like to see how that arsenic does against coconut oil lol.  I'm sure most people aren't eating gallons is this stuff every day.
642 2018-08-22 22:51:13 Far less than the gallon of truffle oil
643 2018-08-22 22:51:08 You can usually get them at smoke shops yeah? I get cbd oil for my dog at the one in Logan
644 2018-08-22 22:50:59 buddy's perm looks like an oil slick
645 2018-08-22 22:50:56 It makes me so happy that this coconut oil story is happening. 83% saturated fat  keep putting it on your toadt bitch 
646 2018-08-22 22:50:53 @CubCadet_USA 54" rtz l

Does a good job. 
Love the remote oil drain.
Did you try to block the oil filter from being removed? Also, it would be nice to have a way to remove it and keep it clean.

649 2018-08-22 22:50:49 What were ALL the variables? What were the test subjects diets like? The studies on coconut oil transporting micro nutrients leads me to believe it also transports the toxins as well (if thats part of your diet i.e. preservatives, fluoride, high fructose corn syrup etc)
650 2018-08-22 22:50:48 tRump was as honest as the cure all snake oil salesman or the very dishonest used cars selling lemon cars at new cars price and still saying he was losing money on it .
651 2018-08-22 22:50:38 /beauty/ gaes, menurut kalian bagusan milk clenser atau oil cleanser?? Aku pakenya buat double cleansing. Sekarang lagi pake wardah yg milk cleanser tp udh mau abis dan mau coba ganti~
652 2018-08-22 22:50:32 this is so predictable. canola oil and high fructose corn sugar are not making the kind of profits they did in the 90s low fat craze. this isn’t credible just because she’s at harvard. someone should check into her grant funding.

also, @harvard, this is embarrassing for you.

656 2018-08-22 22:50:04 1/4 I had a big insight why the young do not like or support Trump. Consider we are sitting on 1000 year reserves of coal (both the UK and the USA). These youngsters know that coal power generation costs 1 (clean coal costs 2) whereas oil costs 3 and nuclear 4-5, whereas (cont.)
657 2018-08-22 22:50:01 I used olive oil in my hair the other day & oh boy. Greasy greasy greasy. 
My hair is dry from the bleach & this is what my sister had so  I can be greasy for a few days if it helps lol

659 2018-08-22 22:49:54 Go coconut oil.
660 2018-08-22 22:49:35 I had to talk about this when I worked at an olive oil shop! Glad it’s becoming more researched!!! Thanks for sharing :)
661 2018-08-22 22:49:35 ANTS keep getting into my $15 argan oil!! I know y’all want clear skin too but a bitch is too broke to be looking out for y’all!!
662 2018-08-22 22:49:28 It’s also a know fact that you shouldn’t cook coconut oil... that’s all this dumb video is saying. No one should be cooking coconut oil.
663 2018-08-22 22:49:28 How the fuck coconut oil is “pure poison”?
664 2018-08-22 22:49:28 You mean where he congratulates Venezuela for helping people? Ah yes, how horrible, what a monstrous thing to want to do!

Nevermind that Venezuala's problems have nothing whatsoever to do with how it spent its money, but where it came from (highly volatile oil prices).
665 2018-08-22 22:49:22 me yesterday: i need to get a flat tummy before LA

669 2018-08-22 22:49:02 Venezuela nationalized everything and used oil 99% of the time, even when the prices fall, to heavily fund social programs with money they barely have. Not everything is America's fault. Maduro fucked up for real since he doesn't know how inflation works.
670 2018-08-22 22:48:54 Oil, sheep and car wrecks!

673 2018-08-22 22:48:38 Hello everybody I would rather have yellow teeth than EVER put coconut oil in my mouth again
674 2018-08-22 22:48:33 Had no business being here? Yes, he had a job that white people refuse to do.
He is a criminal yes, killing an innocent woman.
Let’s not forget that a man who was here legally killed his wife and two babies and stuffed them in an oil can!
675 2018-08-22 22:48:25 Most nutrients and vitamins are fatty soluble. Coconut oil helps with absorption. It’s help lubricates joints, burns fat, contains MCTs which gives you energy and helps recovery. Helps rebuild skin cells inside and out which is why people use it topically, and more. Lol
676 2018-08-22 22:48:20 What? Lol. 
Was it Rituals? If so, yes. You're welcome. The other should be healing oil.

679 2018-08-22 22:48:07 United Kingdom... basically the island of London shouldn’t use coconut oil!
680 2018-08-22 22:48:05 I just realized the plot for DOOM is just that America found oil in hell
681 2018-08-22 22:48:00 Yes, that's exactly what WM does with their Gers figures - blame Scotland for WMs deficit when Scottish oil has kept them afloat for 40 years
682 2018-08-22 22:47:48 You racist, criminal, hate monger!!  Where is your outrage over the American white guy who strangled his two baby girls AND his wife and then shoved them all in oil drums??

Also fun fact: if you’ve eaten movie theater popcorn then you’ve consumed some form of coconut oil before. That’s what they pop it in.
687 2018-08-22 22:47:03 The Olive Oil/Kardashian simile was SAT worthy.
688 2018-08-22 22:47:01 Coconut oil is only good for dry skin
689 2018-08-22 22:46:58 I have a question... If we get our gas and oil out to the world more accessibly what will domestic prices do at the pumps??? #TransMountain @CanadaAction @farmsofcanada
690 2018-08-22 22:46:50 We’ve been using cocoa oil for cooking , hair and skin care for generations nothing happened to my grandmother and great grand mother and they lived with good heath until they passed away in their nineties . I’m not gonna listen to this humbug

1 tbsp a day is more than sufficient esp if that is the only oil u eat.

700 2018-08-22 22:46:11 Just look at the route the train takes. Along Salmon bearing rivers and lakes. Water sheds etc. How many food shippments are displaced by oil trains?

703 2018-08-22 22:45:50 Bacon is literal poison but so many people it because it’s delicious! Moderation is key - probably the same for coconut oil. You’re good girl 
704 2018-08-22 22:45:49 Women get a car and don’t check no oil, no tire pressure, no nothing they just wake up and drive that bitch like it's brand new. 
705 2018-08-22 22:45:49 love Spanish cooking because of the amount of olive oil they use
706 2018-08-22 22:45:42 Get a pan, heat it up just a touch over medium, put some olive oil in, a little more than coating. Grab the meat, sprinkle it with seasons of choice (we like powdered garlic, feel free to be creative). Place it in the oil, listen to the sizzle! Agitate it as if it owed you(cont)
707 2018-08-22 22:45:30 So people still believe the "low fat diet" lie? Read "The Big Fat Surprise" and learn how you've been mislead with questionable studies. Coconut oil is fine. Saturated fats are fine.  Frying in vegetable oil causes cancer. Enjoy your fries.
708 2018-08-22 22:45:27 This weekend i'm goin to get an oil change, replace my headlight, and detail my car,... I can't be playing...
709 2018-08-22 22:45:21 ハァ〜ア……どこかに4989番くん落ちてないかなァ〜(？)
710 2018-08-22 22:45:15 Love when I ask for salt pepper oil and vinegar on my grinder and I get NONE OF IT
711 2018-08-22 22:45:11 calling coconut oil 'pure poison' is obviously hyperbole.
It's high in saturated fat? sure.

maybe let's see the results of a double blind study with
coconut oil
arsenic, and
a placebo group.
712 2018-08-22 22:45:04 Id love to try out the black soap along with the moisturizing oil .
Where in Pretoria can I pick up my order?
713 2018-08-22 22:45:01 Ridiculous propaganda against coconut oil
714 2018-08-22 22:44:53 60 billion in debt. The worlds largest oil reserves in the world. No free and fair elections. Jailing journalists, political opponents, expropriate private businesses, should i go on? Sanctions are against persons. US still pais the oil in cash while russia and china steal
715 2018-08-22 22:44:53 People have no idea the amount of oil pumped onto tankers in the North Sea! From platforms & FPSO installations. It’s millions of barrels, and it happens all over. I have personally been involved in this operation, sometimes close to 400,000 barrels pumped in a single operation.
716 2018-08-22 22:44:47 If you don’t go to @MonroMB for an oil change you’re missing out. They filled my washer fluid, bless them. It was honestly and sadly the best part of my whole day.
717 2018-08-22 22:44:33 Awkward lol. I just don’t like snake oil bullshit. Whether it’s jade eggs for your hooha, essential oils, faith healing, I hate people lying to take advantage and hurt people.
718 2018-08-22 22:44:33 Nixon had the unfortunate reality of the oil embargo recession hit in 1974.  Unemployment went from 5% in Jan 74 to 9% summer 75.
719 2018-08-22 22:44:31 Now that Guyana has an oil & gas industry other Caricom people talking about the region pooling resources... Yeah yall can fuck all the way off
720 2018-08-22 22:44:26 I have tried to cook w/coconut oil but everything just taste like that and it's so gross to me
721 2018-08-22 22:44:21 Bro it’s only Wednesday and I’ve spent like $300 already this week and now I’m fucking otw to Jiffy Lube to get another oil change.. tired of these shits too
722 2018-08-22 22:44:19 I'm just waiting for the book-burnings to start.

No doubt, should the Magic Grandpa and Mao in a Sharp Suit ever get into power, they will ban all trade with Israel and we'll get all our oil from Venezuela.
723 2018-08-22 22:44:00 Yeah I’m ji like not really on good terms with her right now. I need some coconut oil for dese edges
724 2018-08-22 22:43:48 Well coconut oil is bad for you. Guess we gotta chuck it away now
725 2018-08-22 22:43:48 Oil money.
726 2018-08-22 22:43:43 It’s incredibly fatty. The reason it’s good for edibles is that the potency depends on the thc being able to bond with the saturated fat in the oil during the cooking process. Optimized for least healthy process but it works really well
727 2018-08-22 22:43:15 One of my favourite albums from my teens. I found my copy after a big clean up & it still smells of patchouli oil after all these years.
728 2018-08-22 22:43:11 In reference to people calling coconut oil poison, i was just wondering this the other day, i genuinely dont understand why people are using something to greasy to cook with
729 2018-08-22 22:43:03 Ako: Demons born of boiling hot oil... So, the french fries
730 2018-08-22 22:42:57 What exactly would be the step before getting the oil money out of the politicians pockets, who make the laws. ?
Please enlighten me.
731 2018-08-22 22:42:56 The slide oil is pretty cool.
732 2018-08-22 22:42:53 ..The embarrassment and shame of watching a snake oil salesman wielding a bible, attempt to peddle scripture to others.  If you think Sessions will reap a whirlwind, I wonder what the price is of using God to further fuel your ambition, and greed with his name.
733 2018-08-22 22:42:47 Love when a Harvard professor comes out against coconut oil and Paleo/keto dipshits lose their minds
734 2018-08-22 22:42:40 Things oil money can hide from @MLS
735 2018-08-22 22:42:31 C! Moisturizer! Using an acne fighting scrub is great but it dries out the skin and can irritate the acne. Try looking for a water based moisturizer, oil is good too! Just check for harmful ingredients like those shitty sulfates and silicones.
736 2018-08-22 22:42:28 Pure poison this week and next week a study will come out praising coconut oil for some miraculous health benefit.
737 2018-08-22 22:42:23 Wow, that's really odd. My Brasilian family thrives of pure coconut oil and fresh coconut. They all live well into their 80's and 90's. My Irish family on the farm die early from using anything but pure coconut oil. 
738 2018-08-22 22:42:22 Damn u bitches eating coconut oil gotta chill
739 2018-08-22 22:42:07 Agreed! 
India too , in south India (Kerala, Karnataka, Tamilnadu) food is not possible without coconut oil, people are healthier
740 2018-08-22 22:41:28 True, whilst I'm not someone to say we are hard done by or are major victims, the case can be made that Scotland is entitled to more back especially if you factor in Oil and gas of which is in Scottish waters.
741 2018-08-22 22:41:21 Drenched a bandana in olbas oil and every breath I take feels like 718611 eucalyptus leaves are smacking me 
742 2018-08-22 22:41:10 clerical sexual abuse use to be just a conspriacy.
pedophilia use to be just a conspriacy .
Governments arming funding training terrorists use to be just a conspriacy.
Banks and oil cartels laundering moneies for drug barons and arms dealers use to be just a conspriacy
743 2018-08-22 22:41:08 Pence family's failed gas stations cost taxpayers $20M+.Cleanup of Pence family gas stations cost Indiana.Pence family gas stations left costly environmental legacy.The Pence family business, Kiel Bros. Oil Co, leaving states on the hook for cleanup of contaminated sites.
744 2018-08-22 22:41:04 Nick in West Michigan gets out of his car and supervises the mechanics at the instant oil change place  #InsultMadness
745 2018-08-22 22:41:03 Govt has applied for patenting Coconut oil to India first. They applied as soon as #coconutoil trended. Hence the delay.

You just wait and watch. The United States of Twitter India is right behind for any supporting outrage required.
746 2018-08-22 22:40:56 I whole heartedly agree there are far more worse things that do us harm in this world than coconut oil.
Also what works for some does not work for others we are not all the same.
747 2018-08-22 22:40:52 Coconut oil also has antiviral properties.
748 2018-08-22 22:40:51 I like to start by using a cotton ball with tea tree oil. Lightly. Tea tree oil is a strong oil with anti fungal and anti bacterial properties. In addition to my daily routine black soap here and there. Drinking water, sauna & daily use of a hot wet washcloth over excessive soap
749 2018-08-22 22:40:45 Your bro dey waste oil 
750 2018-08-22 22:40:42 Good grief people. So it’s poison? So what? Rice has arsenic in it. Fish has mercury. We all consume stuff all the time that’s terrible for us. If you want to keep using coconut oil then go ahead. Just use it in moderation and for God’s sake shut up about how great it is
751 2018-08-22 22:40:38 That’s why I use macadamia nut oil
752 2018-08-22 22:40:36 Lol... Like people are getting shot up and you can’t figure out why their brains are wired in hatred but uhhhh great job w the coconut oil break through tootsie pop.. I laughed so hard T.. like this lady is really workin that Harvard degree.. 
753 2018-08-22 22:40:29 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
754 2018-08-22 22:40:27 We cannot let this garbage legislation be approved !! Sabotage attempt on our prairie oil industry !!
755 2018-08-22 22:40:19 ur really lost punkin
756 2018-08-22 22:40:10 I need a oil change my shit sound so bogus
757 2018-08-22 22:40:09 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
758 2018-08-22 22:40:09 The diff is most of us don't eat much/any. We use it as makeup remover, moisturizer, lubricant, etc.

Bit of heat chaffing? Coconut oil both soothes and heals.

Magic balm.
759 2018-08-22 22:40:00 White male patriarchy must uphold and defend all its instruments of power, especially the economy, the driving force behind climate change. Coal, oil, fossil fuels, factory farming, slave to low-labor, industrial states enriching the poor, all controlled by white male power.
760 2018-08-22 22:39:56 10.20 tee off  means adios amigos . Be lucky those burning the midnight oil.
761 2018-08-22 22:39:49 Now y'all oil up.
762 2018-08-22 22:39:33 He actually gave me an oil change and a tire rotation at Valvoline last week
763 2018-08-22 22:39:21 Harvard has gone full #Masshole for calling coconut oil "toxic".

I personally experienced benefits from coconut oil, especially when I get fat because of CARBS.
764 2018-08-22 22:39:16 Pardon. I am just too sickened with the fascist idiots to the left and right. Like most raised by immigrants, I believed. That is so over, so 150% over, that it's hard to smile. Got jokes where the fascists - both the idiots and the malicious - all die in boiling oil?
765 2018-08-22 22:39:10 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
766 2018-08-22 22:39:00 Who eats coconut oil that’s gross
767 2018-08-22 22:38:48 Et tu, coconut oil?
768 2018-08-22 22:38:47 Amazingly no! Just the oil change and off I went!
769 2018-08-22 22:38:45 Quit making stuff up Ed. We need coal just like we need gas oil nuclear water wind & solar to keep our country strong. Ever heard of clean coal? You appear to have contracted the Trump Derangement Syndrome.
770 2018-08-22 22:38:42 How else do you make Russian oil more valuable? Ask @Fishbooom
771 2018-08-22 22:38:30 But I dooo have some CBD oil and it helped the other night when I tried it, so I’ll do that tonight.
772 2018-08-22 22:38:22 Sheep...oil...car wrecks...all of it
773 2018-08-22 22:38:21 I mean, don’t eat a jar a day. But the nutritional content and the fatty acids in coconut oil are like super good for you. I had to learn all about it when I was at Natty G. A spoonful a day has tons of benefits. I used to do it!
774 2018-08-22 22:38:12 What's going on with the traffic today?  You'd think it is raining baby oil...  LOL!  #StaySafe #ArriveAlive #GetOffThePhone #PayAttention #DontDriveStupid
775 2018-08-22 22:38:10 You should do some actual research on coconut oil. It's has never been considered "healthy" by a majority nutritionists. The only news here (or actually not surprising) is how many people keep jumping on the latest dietary fad like it's gospel, until the next fad comes alone.
776 2018-08-22 22:38:04 I heard this not that long ago. I try to use avocado oil even though it’s considered a fat it’s a healthy fat whether your just eating an avocado or using its oils. Can you tell I love avocados haha
777 2018-08-22 22:37:52 Ok and some loony person can be an “expert” spouting clickbait headlines like coconut oil is poison. I’ve never been healthier and I got this way with a high fat diet with plenty of coconut oil. My blood work/cholesterol levels are flawless.
778 2018-08-22 22:37:47 How much has Buhari's administration earned from oil & other mineral resources since 2015, Buhari doubles as the minister of petroleum,what is happening to subsidy and other fraudulent avenues osibanjo has created to fund their re-election.Why can't a law professor say the truth?
779 2018-08-22 22:37:44 Bruh. My beard is still being childish. Does beard growth oil really work? Lmaoooooooo
780 2018-08-22 22:37:42 Apparently many have forgotten the last 40 years of conservative government where slashing was their only answer when oil revenues didn't keep pace with their lack of vision for the future.
781 2018-08-22 22:37:41 You would move there when I’m gone... come on down to the land of oil fields and dust hun lol
782 2018-08-22 22:37:33 Y’all eat coconut oil?
783 2018-08-22 22:37:29 I’m using coconut oil in my hair for the first time so basically I’m just really looking forward to looking like Severus Snape tomorrow
784 2018-08-22 22:37:26 Are you being funny?

Because fat is a very very important part of our diet. Healthy fats are essential. Nuts, seeds, avocados, fish, any plant based oil and many other foods.
785 2018-08-22 22:37:21 It’s strategy to malign coconut oil due to failing other cooking oils, due to my experience coconut oil is the best oil for health in the world.

Must not buy false propaganda.

Refined oil companies just trying to uplift their market.
786 2018-08-22 22:37:04 Physicians allow the use of coconut oil as a vaginal lubricant as well.  This is definitely bs.
787 2018-08-22 22:37:01 after i wash my face and dry it. it’s a thick oil but once you apply it it gets easier to spread around
788 2018-08-22 22:36:56 this oil has been around for a couple years and only NOW this potential deadly health risk is found???!!!
789 2018-08-22 22:36:51 It’s strategy to malign coconut oil due to failing other cooking oils, due to my experience coconut oil is the best oil for health in the world.

790 2018-08-22 22:36:51 A white man and American citizen in Colorado just killed his pregnant wife and two children, and stuffed the kids’ bodies into oil storage bins to decompose faster. Explain how your f’kin wall helps? How about the white guy who shot 500 people in Las Vegas? #TrumpCrimeFamily
791 2018-08-22 22:36:47 All oil is bad for you.
792 2018-08-22 22:36:45 You keep talking about coconut oil and then I see that a Harvard professor says coconut oil is one of the worst foods you can est
793 2018-08-22 22:36:39 I'm leaning Danish oil, or I'll  use Waterlox
794 2018-08-22 22:36:05 Thought I was going to bed thinking Trump might be brought down. But the Twitteratti is more concerned about coconut oil. Crazy mixed up world.
795 2018-08-22 22:36:02 Convinced security my oil pen was my inhaler 
796 2018-08-22 22:35:56 We not eating coconut oil.. black people use it on their skin and hair..
797 2018-08-22 22:35:29 Coconut oil is not bad for you, don’t believe that bullshit. Harvard professors also said sugar consumption was not directly related to weight gain... do with that what you will.
798 2018-08-22 22:35:25 wahahaha and they are still very much alive or maybe they’ve become Zombies.. I’m one of them as I’ve been consuming Cold Press Coconut oil over 4 yrs now n I’m still alive n kicking..
799 2018-08-22 22:35:20 @kbsalsaud When the messenger of God came and asked will you help for the cause of God? will you be of those that stood with the deniers? Then will you not help me for the cause of God? Send me oil tankers and investors to make Puerto Rico paradise for the Believers!
800 2018-08-22 22:35:10 Let's face it, big business, big pharma and big oil - aka the folks bankrolling GOP crooks - aren't going to help the career LEO's and 'little guys' ruined by Trump and his sychophant #corruptGOP.
801 2018-08-22 22:35:02 Sweet almond oil I think is supposed to work a bit! But honestly laser is the only way to get ride of them they’re like deep ass scars
802 2018-08-22 22:34:56 Coconut oil and cholesterol are good for you. Ignore these institutions telling you to eat high carbs and low fat diets. They have this this completely wrong and keeping you unhealthy, fat and sick
803 2018-08-22 22:34:54 Coconut oil is the healthiest oil overall!

804 2018-08-22 22:34:50 Is coconut oil bad for us or not? I'm asking for a friend
805 2018-08-22 22:34:44 Fun fact: a heat pump can also function as an air conditioner. I’m so glad we chose a heat pump when our oil furnace died a few years ago.
806 2018-08-22 22:34:43 You know we could be friends if you’d just shave your legs, armpits, back, upper lip and stopped using hemp oil as a shampoo?
807 2018-08-22 22:34:39 I just got $10 off an oil change by being a Katy ISD student but “forgetting my id” 
808 2018-08-22 22:34:19 We cannot let this pass !!! Time to hit the streets folks !!! Justin is sabotaging our prairie oil industry
809 2018-08-22 22:34:05 Saturday nighte: a stubborn zit! Dab it with tea tree oil and it'll be gone in no time.
810 2018-08-22 22:34:04 This study is a lie not coconut oil.

811 2018-08-22 22:34:02 I had a premonition and the next big thing is the McDonald’s Hot Oil Challenge idk what it is yet but it’s gonna be wild
812 2018-08-22 22:33:56 Not for you, well maybe for your dad but he's cured via coconut oil so not an issue. 
813 2018-08-22 22:33:33 I feel like coconut oil is good for you just not in a way that’s good for cooking with it
814 2018-08-22 22:33:30 Erdogan knows very well how Turkey is the #quintessential East-meets-West strategic connector across Eurasia.  And he knows what’s he’s really “#guilty” of: buying the #S-400s, .. advancing Turkish Stream and insisting Turkey will continue to buy Iranian oil. #Escobar
815 2018-08-22 22:33:28 ...snake oil salesmen!!
816 2018-08-22 22:33:19 coconut oil? bad? 
butter was labeled bad too... and then came along margarine... and then butter was deemed safe again... lol 
eat what you want tysm
817 2018-08-22 22:33:13 How much of Scotland's oil revenue is included as Scotland's share? 10%? Don't see many oilrigs off Scarborough!
818 2018-08-22 22:33:10 IDK if any of my followers are into gruesome murders, but one of the 4 kids who abducted, tortured and raped Junko Furuta for 40 days before killing her and putting her body in an oil drum, filling it with cement and dropping it into the ocean;

has finally been arrested
819 2018-08-22 22:33:10 Half the time were just googling how to reset the oil light
820 2018-08-22 22:33:07 Thank god for CBD oil.
821 2018-08-22 22:33:05 How much did the AHA and vegetable oil companies pay her to say that......?
822 2018-08-22 22:32:59 Norway produced 60% more barrels of oil than the UK in 2017
823 2018-08-22 22:32:58 I eat coconut oil dude. I put that on toast.
824 2018-08-22 22:32:54 Absolutely right. Years after the oil price crashed Scotland is still able to spend 22% more than it raises in taxes. That's the benefit of being in the UK family.
825 2018-08-22 22:32:51 I consume far more bourbon than coconut oil.
I'm not too worried about either ... but if I was
the bourbon would be out of my diet first.
826 2018-08-22 22:32:44  Taurus: On Wednesday hot chocolate and oil dribble into the chuckwalla and the pinguid ketches deluge the flower with Stella.

827 2018-08-22 22:32:40 Nothing is wrong with going over to the world’s second largest population that is growing quickly and we have the resources they need; potash, uranium, gold, oil, natural gas if we get lng exports.
828 2018-08-22 22:32:21 You seem to be ok with hiring undocumented immigrants just like your buddy in Iowa.  Maybe that is a bigger part of the problem.  Why don't you come out against white Colorado oil workers, they are killing at 3 times the rate of undocumented immigrants.
829 2018-08-22 22:32:20 Friday na ang hot oil para sure na matuloy juskooo.
830 2018-08-22 22:32:20 そんなぁ(・ω・｀)

832 2018-08-22 22:32:16 I am looking for 1 or 2 people who would like to host a live event for their family and friends about CBD oil  
Pretty please 
833 2018-08-22 22:32:16 Beautiful country, and so much oil
834 2018-08-22 22:32:10 Lol, or "these are the oils you should be using until we tell you you should be using something else even though olive oil is just fine".
835 2018-08-22 22:32:10 แล้วคือตอนนี้ภาพยังติดตาอยู่เลยอะไม่กล้าเดินแล้ว
836 2018-08-22 22:32:00 Bio oil smells good. Real dads know that smell if they was takin care of they child’s mother.
837 2018-08-22 22:31:45 The pipeline has been approved.  You are late to lunch so go home.  You used oil to get there/home. Your outfits reek of oi, your medical care is based on oil.  GET OUT of the way of progress.
838 2018-08-22 22:31:44 London literally just poored tanning oil all over himself 
839 2018-08-22 22:31:42 Also what about tanning oil, it has coconut stuff in it
840 2018-08-22 22:31:42 Ingesting coconut oil is literally like one of the most healthy things you can do.
841 2018-08-22 22:31:41 this coconut oil thing sounds fake and part of the established canon of academics variously praising then condemning all foods all the time, cyclically, for the benefit of their personal brand
842 2018-08-22 22:31:40 สรุปจากกลัวอยู่แล้วก็กลัวยิ่งกว่าเดิมอะขนลุก
843 2018-08-22 22:31:35 Agree Mr DollarBill. Coconut oil makes great popcorn.
844 2018-08-22 22:31:27 Wow, you really deciphered my tweet! Great job Billy
845 2018-08-22 22:31:22 No one is changing their mind. You're getting different studies by different people. 

Let's keep it simple:
-Eggs are bad. Just 1 is over your daily cholesterol limite.
- Margarine and butter are both bad for you. Oil in general is bad.
- Have wine only

846 2018-08-22 22:31:19 People use coconut oil as lube
847 2018-08-22 22:31:19 But I will say though that the oil price remains unchanged other than the fact that it has only gone down a few cents.
848 2018-08-22 22:31:18 I’d like to do my own research on this, but personally I would rather a stable dedicated pipeline rather than railway cars full of oil passing through towns.
849 2018-08-22 22:31:14 Why do we even need their oil. For every illegal alien from Mexico that comes into the US we will reduce the amount of what we pay for oil by 10% a barrel. Brings that there are too many illegals caught each month, we won’t be paying anything at all.
850 2018-08-22 22:31:13 some communities outside the US have used coconut oil for everything from cooking to skin care, and they’re just fine. food trends are so ridiculous.
851 2018-08-22 22:31:09 ありがとですw
852 2018-08-22 22:31:09 YES OIL ON YHE FACE BBY NOOO
853 2018-08-22 22:30:57 Coconut oil does nothing for my skin or hair. It actually makes my hair hard and tangled.
854 2018-08-22 22:30:52 A court filing by prosecutors says Shanann Watts' body was "recovered from a shallow grave near an oil tank," and that "law enforcement recovered the bodies of defendant's two daughters from inside oil tanks located near the grave of their mother."
855 2018-08-22 22:30:50 Nothing like oil revenues stolen from Scotland! Why are there no regional figures simikar to GERS? It s well known tgat London, where all the money flows to distorts the English statistics.

857 2018-08-22 22:30:31 we were watching a cooking show and they said 'the nuts release the oil' i blame them.
858 2018-08-22 22:30:30 I’ll dm you a picture of which one I use   Sometimes I just use coconut oil
859 2018-08-22 22:30:26 So is life..why give up things you enjoy doing...plus coconut oil is an amazing mouthwash and moisturizer.
860 2018-08-22 22:30:23 おやすみさか(-_-)zzz
861 2018-08-22 22:30:19 You’re still a fan favourite here in Oil Country! 
862 2018-08-22 22:30:12 What does he think about the guy who just killed his whole family and put his daughters in the oil tank at work?? Worth a mention of outrage about that while we're on the topic, no?
863 2018-08-22 22:30:12 Coconut oil is dangerous but you still advertise fast food chains that put silicone in their food? Shut up not all people on college are smart and that's the sad part
864 2018-08-22 22:30:03 Rightttt I was like who tf eating spoons of coconut oil
865 2018-08-22 22:29:35 I’m offended by anyone who thinks coconut oil is poison. I use it all the time and I’m fine.
866 2018-08-22 22:29:30 yo @Flossycarter please do a follow up on the screen protector you just reviewed in a few weeks to see it it holds up to heat, oil, weather all that stuff.
867 2018-08-22 22:29:23 Chris Watts, from Colorado killed his entire family on August 12-13. His wife was strangled while she was 15 weeks pregnant. He buried her in a shallow grave and immersed his two young daughter's bodies in large drums of oil. Oh, but he is white.
868 2018-08-22 22:29:21 Yeah because all of the other members of OPEC and UK and Norway have experienced a similar economic dislocation from oil price falls haven’t they? Oh no they haven’t ... I know it isn’t “real socialism” but it it what always happens when someone tries (and fails) to do socialism
869 2018-08-22 22:29:21 I also have this lavender essential oil that I just found out I can rub on my body and I smell so good omg
870 2018-08-22 22:29:13 Coconut oil is 'pure poison' and 'one of the worst foods you can eat', according to a lecture given by a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. @JoyceOnyemuwa
871 2018-08-22 22:29:03 Will get rid of inflammation....could help with pain...get some CBD oil for pain also! Works awesome... Most health food stores carry it now... hopefully in your state,or order on line!
872 2018-08-22 22:28:56 Email from @Conserve_WA -  six oil companies have donated almost $9 million to defeat iniative #1631 because they fear being held accountable for the carbon pollution they are creating — emissions that are making us sick, damaging our forests and contributing to our smoky air.
873 2018-08-22 22:28:55 Who tf eats straight up coconut oil?
874 2018-08-22 22:28:50 It’ll be government red tape to protect the oil companies & fossil fuels. Shareholders come first...apparently
875 2018-08-22 22:28:49 To avoid being burned by hot oil or slippery or many thinga u cn think off
876 2018-08-22 22:28:43 i desperately need to get my oil changed tomorrow, then save up all my money i have and pay my speeding ticket next week... i really dont make enough money for this
877 2018-08-22 22:28:41 I want some warm bread with olive oil & parmesean cheese  and some fettuccini alfredo to go with it ugh
878 2018-08-22 22:28:36 I also use the essential oil too.
879 2018-08-22 22:28:29 A poor girl is murdered and you hate-peddling racists use her as a political tool? Shame on you. Where’s the outrage over other murders? What about the father who just killed his daughters and stuck them in an oil tank? Freaking hypocrites. #MollieTibbetts
880 2018-08-22 22:28:20 Please how much are oil burners ?
881 2018-08-22 22:28:20 Unrefined organic coconut oil is far from poison.  You know what poison is high fructose corn syrup, animal fats from red meat, and trans fats and processed garbage that’s in 75% of the crap at walmart
882 2018-08-22 22:28:10 As long as they deny US access to the oil, it doesn't matter who's at the helm. Look at the middle east and Africa
883 2018-08-22 22:28:10 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
884 2018-08-22 22:28:02 African unity between 2 lads of different ethnicity

I'm not upset, I just came here for some pre-bedtime discussion while I drink my oil. Having a blast

So you agree that white Africans should have the right to exist and own property that they acquire lawfully?
885 2018-08-22 22:28:01 Coconut oil is the best oil you can use no matter what anyone says. These people probably never even tried it.
886 2018-08-22 22:27:56 Coconut oil is higher in saturated fat than lard, according to my Science of Nutrition textbook.
887 2018-08-22 22:27:48 So if you rob a bank, invest the $ in an oil well, strike oil, then mail back the $ 6 months later, you haven’t committed a crime?  SHEESH.
888 2018-08-22 22:27:36 having a car is too much responsibility who said i had money for gas and oil changes
889 2018-08-22 22:27:30 Ha ha.......ya go ahead and use vegetable oil and see who lives longer!
890 2018-08-22 22:27:26 coal is much cheaper than oil. Currently manufacturing cannot compete because power prices are so high not to mention coal is the ONLY dispatchable pwr we have. No hydro due drought.
891 2018-08-22 22:27:17 Not true. Coconut oil is awesome for everything. I’m living proof. I use it for everything and I’m super healthy!
892 2018-08-22 22:27:04 red oil potatoes greens better than fried potatoes greens!
893 2018-08-22 22:26:57 Believe me it makes me upset too - but my car takes a synthetic oil which is more expensive 
894 2018-08-22 22:26:48 Blueberry pancakes with olive oil, honey and coconut nectar 
895 2018-08-22 22:26:26 i just covered my whole head of hair in olive oil
896 2018-08-22 22:26:20 I just always thought it looked gross. And I hate coconut flattening, ergo, I knew I’d hate coconut oil. 
897 2018-08-22 22:26:17 GIRL you know i would my cars oil hasn’t even been changed so hopefully i don’t get stranded 
898 2018-08-22 22:26:08 Just stupid. Do some more research. I use coconut oil for everything. I’m super healthy!!
899 2018-08-22 22:26:00 i take a bath everyday in epsom salt but the coconut oil kind... that stuff really be having my body so smooth.
900 2018-08-22 22:25:56 this isnt new , they have been trading oil straight for gold with china for years even before the gulf oil spill. but now all of a sudden its a big deal.
901 2018-08-22 22:25:44 I’ll try anything. I was using baby oil, soap, olive oil, toothpaste last night. I need to try something new tonight!
902 2018-08-22 22:25:36 OTOH, coconut oil is great for dry skin in the winter. Also has antifungal properties. Just not meant to be taken internally!
903 2018-08-22 22:25:34 Oil panko ensejg
904 2018-08-22 22:25:10 Oil and Water...
905 2018-08-22 22:25:10 Oh that’s such a bummer! I wonder if you can just make something creative with the cbd oil.
906 2018-08-22 22:25:05 Teflon pan Teflon man everything around him is slippery he’s your original snake oil salesmen nothing appears to stick,let’s hope this is the last time maybe the last time I don’t no.
907 2018-08-22 22:24:50 The difference between girls and guys 

I’ve had lights pop up in my car, I turn my radio up and pray nothing happens. 

Jakes maintenance light just came on and he flipped tf out and made me google every possible option it could be. 

You need an oil change my dude, chill

909 2018-08-22 22:24:47 Please let the Caucasians eat their coconut oil. What??? Poison???? 
910 2018-08-22 22:24:19 I have only recently become aware of  how many foods/products contain palm oil thanks to #EmmaThompson on the @BBCTheOneShow. Half of these foods/products don’t need to contain palm oil, we are destroying the lungs of our planet and the lives of the animals! #stoppalmoil #WWF

912 2018-08-22 22:23:48 Usually yes but that oil liquid butter not so much.
913 2018-08-22 22:23:42 Honestly, they need some sort of sixth sense where they realise they’re not welcome! 
I’m smearing the place in peppermint oil. They hate that apparently! I don’t care if the flat smells weird. Conkers and peppermint oil everywhere!  I’ll make a necklace of conkers!
914 2018-08-22 22:23:34 I’m gonna go ahead and say it, I have never eaten coconut oil lmfao 

But, who really out there eating it, where are you !? I have questions !?
915 2018-08-22 22:23:31 It also lowers the ph of your skin causing it to dry out faster once the oil is absorbed. I had dry skin for a bit a dr told me to stop using coconut oil and use something actually moisturising
916 2018-08-22 22:23:24 My girlfriend is out here in this heat changing both of our cars oil & lemme tell y’all how fckn sexy she looks doing it  I got me a wholllleee wife, she sent me inside cause she knows I’m an a/c baby like HAVE I WON OR HAVE I WON 
917 2018-08-22 22:23:04 fuck around (with my coconut oil) and find out
918 2018-08-22 22:23:02 If you aren’t in stocks w/ an oil company well you better fucking be!
919 2018-08-22 22:22:56 Melanin popping hating on bleached palm oil? Sorry bro
920 2018-08-22 22:22:55 Oil companies fund you deniers - they don't fund sceptics.
921 2018-08-22 22:22:51 Coconut oil isn’t good for you
922 2018-08-22 22:22:46 i've never heard of anyone eating coconut oil or liking the taste, personally. but to each his own ig, imma still be using it for that good Hair StrengthTM
923 2018-08-22 22:22:39 Thank you! The #MAGA #Deplorables #MAGA2020 #MAGA2018 & all of @realDonaldTrump people need 2 hear this, They have been awfully quiet about the white man who strangled his pregnant wife & put his 2 young daughters in oil tanks,They are using anything to keep their heads above H20
924 2018-08-22 22:22:36 tak pernah try the hada labo one, but the neutrogena water gel is so good! definitely did control the oil&hydrate at the same time
925 2018-08-22 22:22:34 the dealership guy really out here hooking me up with discounts for my oil change BLESS UP
926 2018-08-22 22:22:32 Oil in its various forms require energy to release them from the earth.  That process creates GHGs.  Then the various uses of oil in transportation, heating, manufacturing create further GHGs, which are a primary cause of #climatechange .  We need to transition to renewables.

929 2018-08-22 22:22:04 Gee whiz. It's almost as if they herded the rubes for election after election and then, suddenly, some snake oil salesman in a peddler's wagon came along and stole the whole herd. 

Who could possibly seen that coming?
930 2018-08-22 22:22:04 It was  Mustard oil that used a revolver to break the thread
931 2018-08-22 22:21:52 What a snake oil salesman!
932 2018-08-22 22:21:27 I hear environment is something you are interested in, you see no environmental benefit of an EPA whose director isn't a lawyer for an oil company? maybe an FDA director who isn't part of big pharma? how are those things working out?
933 2018-08-22 22:21:26 No facts sis . Y’all love Azealia Banks as long she’s supporting the narrative y’all want . Let her come for one of your lil black girls smeared with coconut oil singing about slavery then it’s Azealia is delusional .

936 2018-08-22 22:21:01 @laurastonexx  coconut oil 
937 2018-08-22 22:20:44 Yeah maybe we should all be using Canola oil, like "clean coal" its so much better for you
938 2018-08-22 22:20:29 Oh I've "read up" on it. Tell me, stable genius, what do your readings tell you?

"Soybean oil is healthy fat!"

EXPLAINS A LOT

- Stir in essential oil and vitamin E.

- Pour into sterile jars.

- Put the lids on once the cream is set and cool.
942 2018-08-22 22:19:47 Plus, to be fair, everyone and their real estate agent knew that prices, particularly high value homes were being inflated by oil boom, and that no one in their right mind would pay that to live here. Homes here should never cost more than Halifax. (1/2)
943 2018-08-22 22:19:15 But like can I still use coconut oil on my skin...?

946 2018-08-22 22:18:55 If I break your heart na oil spillage
947 2018-08-22 22:18:36 World want oil petroleum from Saudi Arab as they're serving industry with dignity and pride since long time very qualified and talented nation within oil and petroleum.
948 2018-08-22 22:18:33 This literally reminded me that I needed an oil change 500 miles ago...
949 2018-08-22 22:18:31 When your dad makes fun of you for starting a barbecue with paper and a bit of olive oil stating ,"You're going to smell like oil and take forever to start the fire." Immediately whips out a blow torch and nukes the pile and bursts it a flame.
950 2018-08-22 22:18:25 I literally bought beard oil without even looking shit up or shop online and my ads are full of beard oil now
951 2018-08-22 22:18:21 I was never out here using coconut oil on my face
952 2018-08-22 22:18:19 So let’s talk about canola oil?
953 2018-08-22 22:18:18 i don't actually know if i've ever eaten anything w/ cononut oil in it... the only one to use it is my flatmate and we don't always eat the same dish bUT because i really like the taste of coconuts im gonna say i like it still. plus.. every oil leaves a taste??
954 2018-08-22 22:18:15 I had a dream I was painting with oil paints again. It’s been a long time since i’ve actually done that, but I can still distinctly smell them in my mind.
955 2018-08-22 22:18:12 Best jugak. Aku pkai moisturizer dia. Toner dia banyak good review. Cleansing oil pun. Dia ada botol2 kecik so boleh try dulu la tgk sesuai ke tak
956 2018-08-22 22:18:02 That Prof Karin Michels at Havard better learn fast.. What the hell is she talking about? The old population of the Seychelles Island in the Indian Ocean was pure, healthy n fit using Coconut oil many years ago.. then they opened supermarkets..
957 2018-08-22 22:17:57 Big business Tom. Like oil companies especially have so much to answer for . We could live without bad hydrocarbons but they are so profitable.keep the awareness as your profile grows.
958 2018-08-22 22:17:54 Canada appears to be the only principled nation when it comes to Saudi Arabia and its poor human rights record as a whole. Let's hope other nations can find their balls and support Canada. The Saudis need to sell their oil as much as other nations need it.
959 2018-08-22 22:17:44 Moderation is key totally!  I regularly have 4-5 tsp daily. When it is hot though it doesn't lose its form unlike other oils,; like  Olive oil. It's a different saturated fat though ie to meat, as it metabolizes differently! Bruce Fife has spent his life on this, +I follow him:)
960 2018-08-22 22:17:44 Sad to say, but if we get involved, we will get the same treatment that Canada got and worse. They will cut off our supply of oil in a heartbeat. It’s blackmail but I doubt that our government will say anything
961 2018-08-22 22:17:41 Sherwin Straker - Good Oil
962 2018-08-22 22:17:35 According to the OBR, the Government’s tax receipts from North Sea oil account for 0.11% of its total revenue. Pardon the pun, but that’s a drop in the ocean. Oil is not going to make an independent Scotland prosperous.
963 2018-08-22 22:17:13 Step 1: Making The Base

In your bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of coconut oil with 1 tablespoon of honey. Mix until you are left with a rich, thick, and smooth consistency.
964 2018-08-22 22:17:12 Uniteds success generated their money whilst Arab oil generated city's success. Prostitution at its finest you giant fucking weapon!
965 2018-08-22 22:17:00 I somehow mixed glitter, pink eye shadow, make up oil remover and glitter glue to create some kind of chemical reaction that has dyed my eyelids bright pink
966 2018-08-22 22:16:58 She said don't tell me you fought for me, when you actually let me slip through your fingers.

971 2018-08-22 22:16:18 Same!
When people will understand that is not fat or protein but carbohydrate the problem.
Is the quantity and the quality of carbohydrates.
If you don't exercise, don't drink water and don't have fiber in your diet... is not the coconut oil your problem!
972 2018-08-22 22:15:48 On another matter, you need to reinstate the ban on PAC $ from oil and gas producers.
973 2018-08-22 22:15:45 Responsibility for climate change is not equally distributed - are the Shell & Exxon oil executives who suppressed their own research proving climate change and funding climate change denialism on equal footing with a small farmer in the Third World?

985 2018-08-22 22:13:50 I like olive oil the best.
986 2018-08-22 22:13:41 First, Why would a pharmaceuticals company be against coconut oil but not the other countless health foods?

Second, this article is the result of a Harvard professors lecture comments.

988 2018-08-22 22:13:25 Sure!  Some things that have helped me: weighted blanket, turning off & removing electronics from my bedroom, scented oils (I personally like cedarwood or sandalwood scents.), sleeping in a cold, dark room, CBD oil, and meditation or instrumental sleep music. 
989 2018-08-22 22:13:23 Other users who searched for "young hitler" also bought white bedsheets, kerosene and moustache oil.
990 2018-08-22 22:13:22 Coconut oil is also much higher in fatty acids as well as helps increase HDL and isn’t known to increase your LDL, unless you’re just eating entirely too much of it.

993 2018-08-22 22:13:06 Help with discoloured teeth. via /r/Dentistry

So, I brush my teeth two times a day for about 2-3mins for about one or two years now and I recently started oil pulling with sunflower oil for about 3 weeks but my teeth still maintain a bright yellow colour and I have braces s…
994 2018-08-22 22:12:51 I'm curious. The main takeaway I got was not to take anything fortified with vitamin A: multivitamins, enriched cereal, milk w added A etc. Also cod liver oil, which is one I take a lot of and I believe helps me with certain things but maybe it's time to find an alternative?
995 2018-08-22 22:12:48 Killing time waiting for my oil to get changed.
996 2018-08-22 22:12:20 So if I add a bunch of sugar to the coconut oil, so that I get 50% fat and 50% carbs, it's more healthy?

What I'm getting at is that you're a dumbass and coconut oil is one of the most healthy sources of fat on the planet.
997 2018-08-22 22:12:16 Use olive oil, that made my hair thicker and stronger
998 2018-08-22 22:12:13 Summer isn’t over until my jar of coconut oil solidifies
999 2018-08-22 22:12:13 Truffle oil?  haha
1000 2018-08-22 22:12:09 Where the baby oil at? Ha! Don't hurt 'em Diva.
1001 2018-08-22 22:11:52 CBD is oil extracted from marajuana
1002 2018-08-22 22:11:52 Jetpack technology exists, but the reptiles hoard it for themselves!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Most clowns are just NSA spies in disguise! Never speak secrets to clowns!
1003 2018-08-22 22:11:36 Maybe the truth, McCrone, Devo 79, Oil & fishing Waters theft, Iraq, Gold, PFI, Pensions theft, high five tories, tory coalitions, is getting heard ?
1004 2018-08-22 22:11:35 Yeah this is total bull. The article only says it’s higher in saturated fats which was already known. The thing they didn’t reference is that coconut oil is made of medium chain triglycerides and the body breaks it down more easily. Butter and lard are full of long chain tris.
1005 2018-08-22 22:11:24 Where does your £32 billion figure come from? The U.K. government’s share of oil revenue (from Corporation Tax) is a tiny fraction of the figure you have quoted. Most of the money raised from North Sea oil and gas, not surprisingly, goes to the likes of Shell & BP.
1006 2018-08-22 22:11:10 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1007 2018-08-22 22:11:06 Congrats on getting married Joe. Have a great and see you soon at the Oil Can
1008 2018-08-22 22:10:57 And the hits keep on coming! I love @ericbolling ‘s  idea on how to get Mexico to pay for and us to #BuildTheWallNow! The oil we are buying from Mexico deduct $1-2’s a barrel and put towards the financing of the Wall!
Enough of these illegals and criminals flooding our country!
1009 2018-08-22 22:10:53 It can be good in small quantities Carrie, and if that works for you then brilliant, honestly. But I do echo the concern that it’s used to replace eg olive oil in frying etc and coconut oil while healthier that other saturated fats is not healthier than unsaturated fats.
1010 2018-08-22 22:10:45 Oh you're from America? The land of Injuns and Cumash? Oh I forgot, you already killed and and enslaved them. Pathetic US, killing for oil.

1017 2018-08-22 22:10:07 im kidding. he reminds me of a snake oil salesman. he goes where the winds of $ blows.
1018 2018-08-22 22:09:56 ...in cooking? unless you meant people, literally taking bites of it, but then i suppose they'd drink olive oil straight from the bottle too
1019 2018-08-22 22:09:42 I watched a scientific study on coconut oil where even the doctors were shocked by the reduction in bad cholesterol in people using the coconut oil instead of butter, so this sounds iffy.
1020 2018-08-22 22:09:40 Where did you go to get your oil change?
1021 2018-08-22 22:09:23 I really need my oil change .
1022 2018-08-22 22:09:10 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1023 2018-08-22 22:09:06 And never any mention of the manipulated reduction of oil prices to ensure the 'breakdown' of South American nations' economies.
1024 2018-08-22 22:08:56 what a whole load of rubbish.. I’m a living dead then.. I’ve been consuming COLD PRESS COCONUT OIL over 4 yrs now.. Hmmm maybe I’m a zombie.. Prof here I come.. to feed you more processed coconut oil, more sugar, more high carbs.. you need it..
1025 2018-08-22 22:08:56 that's why olive oil comes in dark green bottles!
1026 2018-08-22 22:08:48 y’all having sex.  must be nice.  mi back fulla so much oil , US a try invade me.
1027 2018-08-22 22:08:45 Coconut oil is not hydrating, y’all. It clogs your pores and sits ON your hair. I’m tired of us getting lied to. Coconut oil is good for cooking and DASSIT.
1028 2018-08-22 22:08:43 There was a recent article from some German doctor who went off her rocker, calling coconut oil "poison." That folks should know better.
1029 2018-08-22 22:08:42 I thought that was established years ago, along with palm oil

1033 2018-08-22 22:08:25 Who cares?! Saudi is the main supplier of oil (10mm barrels) and they are the strategic friend of US, and also one the biggest customer of west weapons. So, who cares about this?!
1034 2018-08-22 22:08:19 Apparently I also now need an oil change

1036 2018-08-22 22:07:58 Done nothing wrong? He committed a crime. Something caught on tape in Cohen's recording. He's a liar, a snake oil salesman and a con artist. The hard part is getting over your pride to admit it. Nevermind his racism and misogyny he's been showing since day one.

1043 2018-08-22 22:07:10 I'm covered in 1 yr worth of #sentinel1 and #sentinel2 data for detection of oil seepage. Does this count? #datapalooza #eodata #bigdata
1044 2018-08-22 22:07:09 Doubt they will need gi go public at $100 lol. That logic would mean the comoany depreciates hugely when oil prices come down back to $70! That would be a$3-7 trillion loss! Thats insane!
1045 2018-08-22 22:07:08 just read something saying coconut oil is actually bad lol
1046 2018-08-22 22:07:07 Diff oil is the worst for me. Can still smell it on the drive months after draining the Omega's, and threw away a T-shirt because of it.
1047 2018-08-22 22:07:00 Kai haba dai. 
1048 2018-08-22 22:06:50 I’m terrified of coconut oil but also have got a gallon of it in my bathroom cupboard
1049 2018-08-22 22:06:26 What? I just bought my first jar of coconut oil last month, still learning everything I can use it for and now it's bad for me.
1050 2018-08-22 22:06:23 *the second her hands start move effortlessly across my back, the warmth of the oil and the slight pressure makes me drift off into a happy, relaxed oblivion*
1051 2018-08-22 22:06:12 Damn that change my oil for the low
1052 2018-08-22 22:06:12 Whatever our oil & burgeoning green energy is bought with. Now where's your unique positives for Union? Stop running away like a coward & deflecting, come on.
1053 2018-08-22 22:06:05 Exactly.  I looked her up. She received one grant worth over $3 million from NIEHS and who is lobbying against coconut oil? The soybean industry - we all know about Round Up Ready Soybeans. Glyphosphate got bad publicity a few days ago. It's all connected.
1054 2018-08-22 22:06:00 Rubbish. Coconut oil is good for many things. You don’t have to eat it.
1055 2018-08-22 22:05:59 Some diesel guys still use these as a secondary, low-bypass oil filter to remove particulates. That class of oil is expensive
1056 2018-08-22 22:05:57 All these conditional cash transfer and other socialist programmes... I hope this pmb govt is watching what's happening in Venezuela... despite having the biggest oil reserves... it's a messed up place now... we're playing with fire ohhh 180m people no be joke ohh
1057 2018-08-22 22:05:53 Y’all actually out here eating coconut oil? Tf
1058 2018-08-22 22:05:51 we don't have a microwave so i just reheated leftover pizza with coconut oil in a frying pan
1059 2018-08-22 22:05:50 we haven't been streaming Oil enough if only she put out some merch ugh
1060 2018-08-22 22:05:38 It isn't that crucial, any oil will work
1061 2018-08-22 22:05:35 (rolls eyes).....Mom.  (skips to next message) "Hi Jackie, it's Crystal. Your order for your #CindyLou bath oil and scented candles came in today. I'll hold them at my place till you get back. Came to sixteen dollars total. Thanks for your kind patronage."

1063 2018-08-22 22:05:29 shouldn't these deliberations been held before the early oil export program..where are these experts when key decisions are being made? Just curious..
1064 2018-08-22 22:05:28 Who is eating this? I use it once a week to deep condition my super dry kinky hair and as an ingredient for a light face scrub! I rotate every other week with Olive Oil.
1065 2018-08-22 22:05:04 stop killing babies for baby oil. Ya can exfoliate and glitter with some other ...hey wait hhhaaaaa you!
1066 2018-08-22 22:05:01 I read the @nytimes article about it, and there are definitely mixed opinions, but I get it — dramatic headline! Regardless, I’m still pro-coconut oil.
1067 2018-08-22 22:04:57 He's found money if he works out. If I'm an Oil fan Yamamoto actually excited me. That kid can be special

1069 2018-08-22 22:04:44 Food expert: Eat healthy

Food expert: Fruit is actually bad for you. Did we say 5 pieces of fruit and veg a day, we meant 7, or is it 3? Replace vegetable oil with coconut oil. Oh wait, coconut oil is actually poison. Fish > Meat, but not too much fish, but enough cause omega 3.
1070 2018-08-22 22:04:31 They are trying to make corn oil great again.
1071 2018-08-22 22:04:29 A drop of oil!?
1072 2018-08-22 22:04:25 drizzle it with olive oil, lemon juice, salt & pepper and stick it in the oven... exquisite
1073 2018-08-22 22:04:12 I have a better idea.  USA does not buy Mexican oil.
1074 2018-08-22 22:04:05 that's why I like Oil of Olay. It has moisturizer in it.
1075 2018-08-22 22:03:50 Yes! Olive oil is great for the skin, hair and nails!
1076 2018-08-22 22:03:29 I use it coconut oil in my oatmeal everyday. My blood work was great. My blood pressure is great too.
1077 2018-08-22 22:03:11 That is some serious third wheeling!
1078 2018-08-22 22:03:00 Someone l know works as a Hydro Carbon Consultant for Shell and he knows exactly how much oil is in the North Sea, he told me that there is still the same amount to come out as has already come out.
1079 2018-08-22 22:02:47 If anyone has the hookup for an oil change let me know! I need one illl greatly appreciated it
1080 2018-08-22 22:02:46 I smell like gas and oil and still didn't get shit done 
1081 2018-08-22 22:02:42 Hey @SieraSantos, Leury deep frying eggs in oil, never seen that. How did it taste?
1082 2018-08-22 22:02:37 My thoughts as well, what oil lobbying firm is paying them to say coconut oil is bad?
1083 2018-08-22 22:02:20 What I fail  understand when Hugo was in power things were ok. This a country with huge oil reserves. Just like Iraq, Iran things are tough. Are these countries systematically targeted buy stirring social disorder? This is a typical CIA regime change tactic. Kwame is an example
1084 2018-08-22 22:02:08 out: coconut oil
in: hash oil
1085 2018-08-22 22:02:07 You do know we overthrew a democratically elected socialist to protect oil co that becomes BP.

1087 2018-08-22 22:02:00 I wish I could remember the name of the medicine. But the doctor orescribed it to supress the cough. It was a yellow see through pill. Looked a little like fish oil and did the job!

1091 2018-08-22 22:01:46 Where's your commentary about the white christian male in Colorado who killed his pregnant wife and 2 daughters who were found in oil tanks? 
You don't really care about crimes unless you can tie them to the president's racist agenda
1092 2018-08-22 22:01:46 I know she doesn't pay much for them, but still, I feel bad because I just stick them in the closet somewhere and think, well, maybe I'll use them eventually. Well, eventually never comes because I prefer my Oil of Olay.
1093 2018-08-22 22:01:27 He's a lying psycho. No one pissed enough to kill someone over the death of their kids then dumps their babies in oil vats and goes on TV talking about "missing" them.  He killed them all, no one is fooled.  #ShannanWatts

1099 2018-08-22 22:01:15 Is this going to address the danger to them from palm oil plantations?
1100 2018-08-22 22:01:12 It’s more of an ending than “Hey, there’s an oil rig. Okay, we’re done,” though.

1104 2018-08-22 22:00:49 I like him. Watercolors were historically used as a sketching pre-painting tool the great masters used out in the field. They then brought the sketches back to their studios to paint. Bougie oil painters today still poo-poo its relevance. #ilovewatercolors

1112 2018-08-22 22:00:16 Not convinced by that argument. We expanded state spending because of the oil revenues when we could and should have kept a tithe back. Tax cuts made things worse.
1113 2018-08-22 22:00:15 I feel the same, Lynn. I don't know how many big packs of bottles of body wash I've gotten from one of my aunts for Christmas and I never use them because they're not in the kind I prefer--Oil of Olay.
1114 2018-08-22 22:00:06 who the fuk said that?? ya'll need a pan of hot oil spilled on y'all then you'll know what pain is
1115 2018-08-22 22:00:00 @USATODAY the recent post on #coconutoil appears to be a biased opinion filled with scientific errors; it delivers misleading information to the consumer and should be reviewed. Coconut oil is not poison and the most recent research suggests so; having it with moderation is fine!

 Your tweet was void of Solutions, full of ignorance.
1120 2018-08-22 21:59:38 It’s super good on popcorn, too. It ’s like butter, or expensive Crisco, right? Great for some things, but it wouldn’t be my go-to cooking oil. Certainly wouldn’t be trying to put extra into my diet.
1121 2018-08-22 21:59:38 i wash my face with dr bronners soap in the shower. and then in the morning and night i use witch hazel to tone, then a really layer of 100% aloe vera gel as moisturizer and before it dries i mix tea tree oil and witch hazel and apply that to problem areas
1122 2018-08-22 21:59:33 Surprise? Hardly... this is from the same Oil industry playbook that all media uses, it’s called propaganda and censorship and it’s the fuel our Corp media runs on
1123 2018-08-22 21:59:32 I don’t give a fuck ima still use coconut oil on my hair it’s done wonders for my eczema n dry scalp
1124 2018-08-22 21:59:23 Keep forgetting to check the oil

1126 2018-08-22 21:59:15 Change Your Pillowcases! All night, every night your face is touching your pillowcase, causing oil and bacteria to transfer onto the fabric.
1127 2018-08-22 21:59:13 #fakenews Traditional coconut oil is mostly medium-chain triglycerides. Looks like @American_Heart's lobbying group is getting ready to buy up some more coconut.
1128 2018-08-22 21:59:06 @pooja303singh they are sitting on the oil and enjoying the muftkhori

The day oil finishes 

They will became all services boys of the hotels and their ladies will do start belly dance like they use to do
1129 2018-08-22 21:59:00 In other news, I just scheduled an oil change for 8 a.m. on a Monday because this is what being an adult is. This is the first oil change of my life that hasn't been done by myself or my dad and idk how to feel about this
1130 2018-08-22 21:58:54 Oh dear lord I am right there with you on that.  If anger isn’t built into you through some sort of horrid programming, it is energy leaching.  It’s like an oil spill in your aura.
I recommend a blunt and comedy.  Or just comedy.  Laughing floods your brain with endorphins!
1131 2018-08-22 21:58:50 While there is a per capita discrepancy we need to address, on the whole, twice as many white people are killed by cops every year than black people. both unarmed and armed. Can you name a single one?
1132 2018-08-22 21:58:46 Damn, what exactly is coconut oil good for?
1133 2018-08-22 21:58:42 What do you propose we do with the white American male who murdered his pregnant wife, murdered his two daughters, and stuffed their bodies in a barrel of oil? Build a wall around Colorado?
1134 2018-08-22 21:58:40 It hasn't help any, he still looks like an oil field ready to pop.

1139 2018-08-22 21:57:53 In the 70's when I was in the US it (olive oil) was practically unknown
1140 2018-08-22 21:57:52 Eh, hold on oil giants gain gov subsidy while gov cut renewable incentives and projects, doing everything to stop progress.
1141 2018-08-22 21:57:45 I hope you’ve been stockpiling the squirrel oil
1142 2018-08-22 21:57:43 What we should be doing is canceling oil purchases from Saudi Arabia and transporting our own western oil to eastern refineries.
1143 2018-08-22 21:57:43 So you unionists can stop with the deficits, and no money shit. We all know it would be England that suffers the most, out of the union and the EU,  no revenues from Scotland ,no oil, gas, or water. See how well that goes down in London,
1144 2018-08-22 21:57:41 Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will hold off auctioning any new oil blocks for at least two years: WSJ
1145 2018-08-22 21:57:37 aint coconut oil essential for enterign ketosis

1146 2018-08-22 21:57:20 A guy in COLORADO murdered his WHOLE FAMILY! AFTER STRANGLING HIS CHILDREN, (some about the age of yours) HE DUMPED THEM, in an old oil storage tank! (he's a PEACH!) Then, or before, HE MURDERED HIS WIFE! So......even though he had a girlfriend, he had no excuse to do what he did
1147 2018-08-22 21:57:19 due for a pap smear AND an oil change
1148 2018-08-22 21:57:15 Lol, are you really thinking you have better information? What, are your favorite Wings made in coconut oil or something?
1149 2018-08-22 21:57:14 But the oil industry will prosper, so that’s obviously the main thing in the Tory priorities.
1150 2018-08-22 21:56:56 Hmmm where did you get it from? Apologies if I missed the point. Long day man. What I do know about cannabis oil is that it extended my wife’s life by a year or so. I’ve seen it first hand man. It does good stuff
1151 2018-08-22 21:56:51 How does a big 'ol fat, juicy increase in gasoline tax sound? Take it from me, pardnor, I am IN the oil production business and when this shale shit is gone, its ALL gone. So, America needs to get weaned of stupid pills real quick.
1152 2018-08-22 21:56:48 This woman is a paid shill... her lack of knowledge around fats, especially saturated fats is astounding! Literally indoctrinated by the pharmacy companies! 
FYI the Canola oil she promotes WILL bring you closer to heart disease!
1153 2018-08-22 21:56:42 Do you use any oil ?
1154 2018-08-22 21:56:42 I showed my mom my burn and she said next time I plan on doing that to be more careful. Bc yes mom I have a set schedule on when I’m going to burn my arms with 350 degree oil
1155 2018-08-22 21:56:37 The present administration in Nigeria has claimed that some huge amounts of money  which can take care of average Nigerians without oil money has been recovered.But today Nigerian has not felt the impact of the recovery and EFCC is just keeping mute.

1157 2018-08-22 21:56:02 Good evening John @jwripple To be honest I have no specific details regarding the date that Wally might have painted "Boulogne Harbour" but my best guess is the late 60's. As you say, he has captured the scene so well: one can even see what looks like the film of oil on the water
1158 2018-08-22 21:55:55 my main routine lately: simple oil cleanser, hada labo ha foaming cleanser, (optional neogen cica pads), missha fte, klairs unscented toner (benton aloe bha toner on nose), dr jart cica serum, it's skin licorice ampoule, benton aloe propolis gel.
1159 2018-08-22 21:55:54 I honestly find coconut oil pointless
1160 2018-08-22 21:55:51 If only @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @FoxNews @PressSec and @realDonaldTrump were as outraged about the WHITE American CITIZEN who MURDERED his PREGNANT wife and 2 small CHILDREN and SUBMERGED their bodies IN OIL, then went on TV begging for help to find his missing family!!
1161 2018-08-22 21:55:49 I take your other points but you should open your views on Venezuela. Oil has greatly regained its price and ask yourself why Saudi is not suffering similarly, because it is a cornerstone of the US system and receives arms deals while Venezuela receives sanctions.

1165 2018-08-22 21:55:27 Yeah really looks like we can make it on our own. And that’s will s good year from taxing oil and us. FFS.
1166 2018-08-22 21:55:20 I'm a licensed cosmetologist & I agree w you, Adriana. It shouldn't be used as a makeup remover or moisturizer. There are products made for your skin that won't clog your pores. Coconut oil gradually breaks your acid mantle & slowly inflaming your pores.
1167 2018-08-22 21:55:17 people were consuming coconut oil? wait, really???

1173 2018-08-22 21:54:43 If solar power was viable somebody would be making money off of it. People who snivel about corporate welfare but are okay with handouts to modern day snake oil salesmen make me chortle, snort and guffaw.
1174 2018-08-22 21:54:41 The United States is a trash fire. Actively working to overthrow a sovereign Democratically elected government to steal their oil. No surprise here. United States of America is the most corrupt and evil country in the history of the world

1182 2018-08-22 21:53:34 It’s unbelievable how you can just twist and turn subjects into sly suggestive meaning. Your name should be ‘snake oil salesman”
You speak in innuendo, oblique language to disparage. That’s the way of the left.

1184 2018-08-22 21:53:32 The middle class are really the ones reaping the benefits of the tax and reg cuts. Higher wages, more jobs in mfg, oil, steel, coal, less unemployment and wages going up first time in 10 yrs, lower taxes and more money in their pockets and more opportunity in the work market.
1185 2018-08-22 21:53:11 Are you saying this video is a crock, or just that coconut oil is?
1186 2018-08-22 21:53:08 Snake oil isn't a patch on baby oil..
1187 2018-08-22 21:52:55 This resulted in a collapse in coconut/copra prices and increased poverty in the Asia Pacific. Yet people in Pacific and Asia who had consumed coconut oil for centuries did not suffer heart and lifestyle diseases until they moved to a western diet high in refined carbohydrates.
1188 2018-08-22 21:52:41 Coconut oil was a lie.

1190 2018-08-22 21:52:27 Aww there must some truth from this highly skilled Prof Karin Michels!! Please someone feed her more PROCESSED COCONUT OIL.. I bet you she has no concept of refined or unrefined.. She needs a diet extra high in Trans Fat, Carbs, all thise sugary rubbish..
1191 2018-08-22 21:52:16 The liberals are so technically challenged they don’t realize that it takes the same smount of carbon to create solar power and  wind power, in manufacturing devices. And oil creates the same as coal. Coal is cleaner, it doesn’t spill.  But then I am a chemical engineer. #qanon
1192 2018-08-22 21:52:07 No one has confirmed she is the girlfriend yet.  She appears to be most  likely person from witness list because of her background in the oil  industry and the observation that she has scrubbed her social media  sites.
1193 2018-08-22 21:52:04 "Donald Hensrud, medical director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program, told USA TODAY last year that "there’s a disconnect between people’s general beliefs and what the data actually show."  About coconut oil...and our society as whole. #everyoneis

1196 2018-08-22 21:51:50 Love how the White House comments on this murder and ONLY this murder when the most horrific news this week was of a husband strangling his pregnant wife and two young daughters, dumping them into oil tanks.
1197 2018-08-22 21:51:43 Saudi Arabia has called off both the domestic and international stock listing of state oil giant Saudi #Aramco and disbanded advisers
1198 2018-08-22 21:51:43 Yes but no? It’s just people in old jobs looking to not have to move on to learn new skills. Like oil, papers, coal power, etc.
1199 2018-08-22 21:51:40 She should conduct a study on Keralites. We prepare everything with coconut oil. Coconut oil is essential ingredient here. Kerala still has the highest overall life expectancy at birth, at 74.9 years–72 for men and 77.8 for women in India.
1200 2018-08-22 21:51:39 Brought my car in for an oil change and found out it’s a death trap & not drivable so...... yeah
1201 2018-08-22 21:51:24 Me: Just wanted to bring my car in for an oil change

Car Shop: “Ok, so you need to change your wipers, windows, tires, brakes, engine, and a button on your steering wheel... better yet you need a new car. That’ll be 20k please” 

Me: I’ll just drive it until it blows up thanks
1202 2018-08-22 21:51:15 People eat coconut oil?

1205 2018-08-22 21:50:52 One of the other causes of emotional stress (less traumatic but OH-SO-EXHAUSTING) is having to deal with the "helpful people" - the fish oil people, the bee sting people, the prayers people, the EMF is your problem people.
1206 2018-08-22 21:50:46 According to my mom you become immortal if you ingest enough coconut oil..

1211 2018-08-22 21:50:39 Or a sovereign wealth fund like Norway. But unlike them we just pissed away our oil and gas revenues.
1212 2018-08-22 21:50:39 Have you tried Vaseline? Orzinc and caster oil, can only put this on at night though as you need to lather it on
1213 2018-08-22 21:50:32 Did you cut out oil free products and try strong clycolic pads?
1214 2018-08-22 21:50:31 coconut oil man

coconut oil

i only use it for my hair
1215 2018-08-22 21:50:10 The majority of terrorism stems out of Saudi Arabia. Are we to say that if terrorism is a reason to not do business with someone then the United States is not delivering millions of dollars of weapons and purchasing tons of oil everyday. Stop talking in rhetoric recognize facts
1216 2018-08-22 21:50:00 The soybean industry wanted to take over the market space held by coconut oil. They campaigned to have coconut oil banned from popcorn cooking in US cinemas and replaced with soybean oil.
1217 2018-08-22 21:49:46 @TheFive let’s see, Juan’s comment on minimum wage.  Good example of why it doesn’t work in reality.  I used to pay $45 for an oil change, now it is $49.  Thanks to the minimum wage.  Yep, doesn’t work.  Socialism doesn’t wor, Dufus Cortez doesn’t work.
1218 2018-08-22 21:49:45 YO!!! Baby Oil is flammable?! Why would they make a product that makes your baby's flammable?!?!
1219 2018-08-22 21:49:44 Also hard to believe our politicians would rather enable reliance on importing Saudi oil, over a pipeline that would transport Canadian oil.
1220 2018-08-22 21:49:43 morning: wash my face w neutrogena grapefruit cleanser, tone w witch hazel & moisturize w burt’s bees intense hydration or lush’s celestial. night: take off makeup w coconut oil & wash my face w african black soap + tone and moisturize. spot treat w 10% benzoyl peroxide or lemon

1226 2018-08-22 21:49:13 Well its not entirely useless, this oil fact will save a life 
1227 2018-08-22 21:49:12 @ethanjweiss I see “coconut oil is pure poison” is trending on Twitter today.  Any short, sweet opinion about it?
1228 2018-08-22 21:49:10 Dems want to “ lift up the middle class”? How about getting rid of Obamacare which they can’t afford? Dems want to get rid of coal mining jobs, oil drilling jobs, steel mfg jobs, higher taxes and more regs to stifle bus. Dems only care about free stuff for lower class and regs.
1229 2018-08-22 21:49:02 COCONUT OIL
1230 2018-08-22 21:48:58 Yeah ...to sell their 3rd rated cheep product they r using this way . I am from kanyakumari and I can't imagine my food without coconut. Even if I die because of coconut oil we people won't come to u .
Thank you
1231 2018-08-22 21:48:39 Numerous doctors says Coconut Oil is poison and really bad for you.

The guy who did the score for Mass Effect says its not.

Which one should I believe? 
1232 2018-08-22 21:48:38 Look at the bright side, I am onyii i create beauty, fashion and lifestyle videos on YouTube and i model for kings vegetable oil brand. Thank me later.
1233 2018-08-22 21:48:35 What a POS. This guy needs the electric chair. No mercy for a man who kills his pregnancy wife, development son and two sweet daughters....THEN puts them all in OIL tanks! Nope!
1234 2018-08-22 21:48:21 Ylang Ylang oil. This can be very beneficial for people who have lost interest in sex due to tremendous workload, professional stress, depression, or the effects of pollution.  relying on natural essential oils like ylang-ylang can really help you find your sex drive.
1235 2018-08-22 21:48:18 Y'all still think eating coconut oil is healthy? aight...
1236 2018-08-22 21:48:16 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
1237 2018-08-22 21:48:02 I eat coconut oil most days. My drs rave about my great cholesterol numbers and how wonderful my good cholesterol is. Before coconut oil I was borderline for high cholesterol.
1238 2018-08-22 21:47:56 Well the coconut trees died so they could get the oil, so…
1239 2018-08-22 21:47:45 It's both. Always has been both. Chavez could get away with his bullshit socialism because for a decade he swam in an ocean of money. When oil revenue crashed, his so-called "socialism" went to hell.
1240 2018-08-22 21:47:28 @GordonRamsay hi does salting or putting oil in water for pasta make a difference once cooked apart from making it not stick together?
1241 2018-08-22 21:47:28 White guy who killed his pregnant wife and seems to have strangled his young daughters before submerging them in oil. What was his family background? Oh that’s right...
1242 2018-08-22 21:47:25 Per questo bisognerebbe dare più risorse e poteri a queste istituzioni. Ma dopo scandali come quello oil for food Che sconvolse l'ONU la mia fiducia è venuta molto meno
1243 2018-08-22 21:47:24 I think you meant to say chandler needs to change the oil in your car for you
1244 2018-08-22 21:47:20 I just started my dietetic program to be an RDN and coconut oil is a saturated fat, it is not the best for you, but compared to other oils, it is relatively healthy. It is still recommended to minimize saturated fat intake. Everything in moderation.
1245 2018-08-22 21:47:10 How many coffee mugs have I accidentally smashed to pieces in the last month you ask? Why, two. Two precious mugs and a 33oz bottle of my kid’s MCT oil... cc @ericsalinas oops!
1246 2018-08-22 21:47:02 Yes, he is already in place looking for the Atlantis of the desert where oil covers walls...
1247 2018-08-22 21:47:02 once my mom sends me my essential oil diffuser it’s over for y’all
1248 2018-08-22 21:47:00 You might want to do a more comprehensive literature review on coconut oil before jumping to conclusions, go a little further back. The original scare campaign on coconut oil was funded by the US soybean industry via sham lobby groups.
1249 2018-08-22 21:46:54 White guy who killed his pregnant wife and seems to have strangled his young daughters before submerging them in oil. What was his family background? Oh that’s right..
1250 2018-08-22 21:46:51 That's exactly what @jkenney ex Communications Director, Blaise Boehmer,  lobbied JK for with Tim Hortons.  When the Gov. of AB asked Kenney for Temp workers in the Oil fields at going rates.. he called @LukaszukAB an ahole and denied the request.
1251 2018-08-22 21:46:48 I've not had a GPS lock for some time, I'm assuming there's a problem, i'll reboot shortly and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
1252 2018-08-22 21:46:48 Ylang Ylang oil. N3000..has antiseptic properties,can be drop in bathing water for calming effect,it's known to enhance sexual drive,
Aphrodisiac
The essential oil derived from ylang-ylang can activate romance within couples and improve your sexuallife.
1253 2018-08-22 21:46:45 Most people I know would recommend 100% MCT oil over coconut oil.
1254 2018-08-22 21:46:40 A Colorado CITIZEN murdered his pregnant wife and 2 and 3 year old daughters. Threw the kids bodies in oil drums where he worked. Wife was 5 months pregnant with a little boy. 2 or 3 days ago.
1255 2018-08-22 21:46:35 ye claim that president donald "trump" (drumpf) is a man, but have ye gazed upon his flesh? his flesh bears more resemblance to cakes made of corn dough and cow's cheese cooked in hot oil than it does to the flesh of a man
1256 2018-08-22 21:46:35 White guy who killed his pregnant wife and seems to have strangled his young daughters before submerging them in oil. What was his family background? Oh that’s right..
1257 2018-08-22 21:46:32 The media is particularly bad at informing the public how important or relevant individual bits of news are. "Avocado oil may cure cancer." "The Earth's temperature rose 0.1 degrees over the past decade" are not equally important but you wouldn't know that based on the reporting
1258 2018-08-22 21:46:30 Castor oil with a scalp massage  
1259 2018-08-22 21:46:29 Im in this beauty group on Fbook & the girls came for my head when I told them not to use coconut oil on their skin before sun exposure bc it is literally cooking oil and will burn you!! Lol they were like “omg no it the best moisturizer, you don’t know what you’re talking about”
1260 2018-08-22 21:46:28 Hi @TerryJaymes, what is the brand of hemp oil balm/cream that you use? Thanks! Love the show, I can’t work unless you guys are in my ear lol 
1261 2018-08-22 21:46:25 I say use saturated fats that actually taste good (butter & lard) in moderation. Not a big fan of coconut oil. Like coconut and coconut milk.
1262 2018-08-22 21:46:20 boiled yam with red oil sauce over both
1263 2018-08-22 21:46:08 You pick Nigeria - a wealthy, oil rich nation that doesn't produce sugar, tobacco, meat or live animals to any EU consumer. These are WTO tariffs, that I guess you want to impose on EVERY developing nation in Africa by leaving the EU.
EU GSP & Pref status means ZERO tariffs.
1264 2018-08-22 21:46:06 @Dgree3rd Abiy ahmed he dream day light   
The people of ogadenia behind  there strugglers freedom fighters and there leader(ONLF) no one can hide our struggle and Ogadenia Gas is not easy to take we told and warn china engineers
Immediately withdraw. Ogadenia oil not forsale.
1265 2018-08-22 21:46:04 Harvard said sugar was good and fat was bad and now they are saying coconut oil is bad  these mother fuckers
1266 2018-08-22 21:46:04 Yeah when i inevitably throw coconut oil about i just rub it in my hands and stuff :D
1267 2018-08-22 21:46:04 というわけでおはごですね
1268 2018-08-22 21:46:03 USA and Iraqi oil fields... same thing.... they just have a nicer sheen about themselves and are the judge i guess!!
1269 2018-08-22 21:46:03 “This olive oil is a slut” @pasta_pal
1270 2018-08-22 21:45:58 Jojoba oil. N2500.soothes dry skin, has anti inflammatory properties, nutritious to the skin with natural vit E and B,prevents wrinkles & blackheads,removes sun burn and peeling of the skin,it's highly recommended for people with sensitive skin ,make up remover,face moisturizer
1271 2018-08-22 21:45:33 @RudyGiuliani Rudy just knows his client is going the way of Nixon soon and is flailing around helplessly , trying any snake oil salesman tactic to avoid what is inevitable
1272 2018-08-22 21:45:23 I like a mix of mayo and mustard. Olive oil would be good though. Throw in some fresh herbs
1273 2018-08-22 21:45:17 wahahahahaaa.. I must be a living dead.. Mmm it’s been 4 years plus I’ve been consuming lots of COLD PRESS COCONUT OIL ..
Is that Prof Karin Michels at Havard good in her head? Please someone feed her more sugar.. She needs it..
1274 2018-08-22 21:45:17 I  personally am interested in the high smoke point of the grape seed oil ... useful for when I spontaneously combust at the thought of the bottom feeders that exist in LNP ... I feel a spill coming on... anyone got a match?
1275 2018-08-22 21:45:16 Who gives a fuck about oil and gas anyway
1276 2018-08-22 21:45:04 It was really nice. Quick, too. The longest bit was frying the chicken. The chorizo took about three seconds to cook, then I fried the chicken in the oil from it.

1278 2018-08-22 21:45:01 Woke up to find a cat had tipped over the New England fire starter in the home office. Later, dog runs on the mud flats at low tide.

Office smells of lamp oil, wet dog, mud, and sea salt.

How’s your day going? 

(On the bright side, mine is still better than @realDonaldTrump)
1279 2018-08-22 21:45:01 Don't read MSM. I use facts. Try it.

Have you appraised the sources? Looked at the evidence? Backed what they state? No? 

May I also remind you it is you backing oil...
1280 2018-08-22 21:44:58 My moms gonna flip when she finds out about coconut oil 
1281 2018-08-22 21:44:56 That guy over there ain't gon' be able to tear Olive Oil like the Grinch will.
1282 2018-08-22 21:44:49 I don’t think it’s any worse for you than canola oil, butter, or margarine in the amounts that normal people consume
1283 2018-08-22 21:44:48 Pathetic twisting this to meet YOUR agenda Mollie Tibbetts'family made it clear they do not want you using this politically. I don't see your anger about the American in Colorado who murdered his family & stuffed his daughters into an oil barrel. #shameful
1284 2018-08-22 21:44:47 Same people who promote coconut oil are the same ones killing themselves on high fat diet fads.  Won't learn until they need that double bypass surgery.
1285 2018-08-22 21:44:15 Coconut oil ehhh.... 
1286 2018-08-22 21:44:01 That’s cocoa butter and baby oil you feel me LOL
1287 2018-08-22 21:44:01 first it was Black Soap then it was Eco Style Gel & now it’s Coconut Oil !!!
1288 2018-08-22 21:43:43 These look great! You can make sunless 'sunblushed' tomatoes by cooking them for a while in a very low oven (check online for timings etc. as I can't remember), which I'm sure you could keep in oil for a time. 
1289 2018-08-22 21:43:35 Harvard scientists are warning that coconut oil is pure poison. I'm warning that it doesn't taste anything like a Mounds...no matter how much of it you eat.
1290 2018-08-22 21:43:34 The economy of various Nations is dependent on sales of coconut oil and coconut products. The corporations proliferating  use and promotion of coconut oil and coconut products have a vested interest in advertising campaigns that convinced us it's the best food on Earth...
1291 2018-08-22 21:43:34 I know you can cook with coconut oil, but I didn't know people just ATE the coconut oil out the fucking tub!! 

What
1292 2018-08-22 21:43:30 So what about the white guy that killed his entire family in Colorado last week and cut them up and put them in an oil barrel? You shouldn’t be so quick to judge someone based on race or origin of demographic.
1293 2018-08-22 21:43:21 Myrrh, a bitter tasting  painkiller, was a key ingredient of the Holy anointing oil. Pain - whether it's what grieves you most about society or a painful experience you've been through - is a powerful pointer to the anointing you carry upon your life.

1294 2018-08-22 21:43:18 And palm oil is not only unhealthy but, a scourge on our planet. Ban palm oil. Do not buy ANYTHING with Palm oil in it.
1295 2018-08-22 21:43:13 Definitely going through an olive phase. Olives in lemon oil this week. Am I mad?
1296 2018-08-22 21:43:10 It's a misinformation. Like they did it for musturd oil vs oilive oil. Indian cows Milk vs Jersy cow milk

1299 2018-08-22 21:42:46 Plus I steal oil from the jar to use on my hands and lips and hair and it's fantastic for that.
1300 2018-08-22 21:42:45 Y'all saying coconut oil is bad but have you seen what it does to my legs. You wouldn't know cause y'all asses say "iTs NoT sAfE!1!1" boo you whore
1301 2018-08-22 21:42:44 I eat coconut oil on everything and in everything, love it.

1302 2018-08-22 21:42:43 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1303 2018-08-22 21:42:43 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1304 2018-08-22 21:42:40 White American man kills wife and kids and dumps them in oil tanks.  He says nothing.
Iowa woman killed by man from Mexico of questionable immigration status. 45 invokes ISIS.
1305 2018-08-22 21:42:27 We will liberate our selves my sister.
We don't have enough oil.

the sick fuckwit coward
1309 2018-08-22 21:41:57 I just got finished applying coconut oil to my skin :/
1310 2018-08-22 21:41:51 I love how all these western analysts and traders are acting shocked that #Aramco's IPO is cancelled. What did you expect? A 30 yrs something reversing decades of nationalization? King Faisal started it in 1950, finalized in 1980. Read some #oil history. #OOTT
1311 2018-08-22 21:41:51  Yeah pretty much. My husband is on the Paleo diet so we don't use other random vegetable oils anymore and have found that refined coconut oil is so much easier and better I don't understand why anyone would use anything else. Use less, burn less, not dairy, etc. 
1312 2018-08-22 21:41:38 Looks like an oil change with a car wash.  Hope you have enough for everyone in line  #firemanhumor #Traffichell
1313 2018-08-22 21:41:28 Slump in sales of Snake Oil.

1316 2018-08-22 21:41:22 My D-i-L did core testing for NS - there is oil there for the next ONE HUNDRED YEARS, and new techniques make it viable for retreiving it! That's why WM does NOT want to let us go! We will keep UK afloat (no pun intended) for 100 years yet!
1317 2018-08-22 21:41:21 Maybe if you try something sticky! Caramel, chewing gum, toffee? I am not even going to ask how you got micro fibers in your mouth!! They just said on the news that coconut oil is pure poison! Saturated fat and cholesterol!!
1318 2018-08-22 21:41:14 coconut oil is for HAIR sweetie stop eating it. and body if u have eczema
1319 2018-08-22 21:41:12 As in, any random oil. Falaana dhimkaana is a Hindi phrase.
1320 2018-08-22 21:40:54 Thanks Sarah Driscoll for helping me introduce oils to the employees at Guild Mortgage yesterday !! With your help we were able to share lots of  oil goodness !!
1321 2018-08-22 21:40:49 This is probably bullish for oil, as now they won't have to over drill to get the numbers ready for the IPO
1322 2018-08-22 21:40:49 wash, tea rinse, hot oil treatment, and deep condition
1323 2018-08-22 21:40:46 needs to be drowned in boiling oil.... vile human
1324 2018-08-22 21:40:42 It is very difficult to criticize the problems of the world when you are part of the Establishment if a regime that overthrew  peaceful governemnt and replaced it with the most torturous horrific society scene in modern history.
1325 2018-08-22 21:40:42 Ok, I'm at a dealership for an oil change (the coupon is worth it). Things I know about my car: it has fairly low mileage, I have a nail in the sidewall of one of my tires and it is not fixable. Let's see what happens!
1326 2018-08-22 21:40:40 Thank you - good. Yes, really good. What are we doing in Europe with the "refugees" from the Arab world? we have no oil and our financial resources are modest. please to practical suggestion 
1327 2018-08-22 21:40:37 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
1328 2018-08-22 21:40:28 They also say the same for mustard oil. what kind of morons are they.
1329 2018-08-22 21:40:26 Praise like oil, for you I pour it out, for you I pour it our, I pour, I pour it out for You.
1330 2018-08-22 21:40:26 I just detangled my 4c hair with warm water & coconut oil for the 1st time, & i have to say i really like it so far. . & after i washed it, my hair felt really soft.!

1334 2018-08-22 21:39:51 Instead of saying coconut oil is bad for you why don't you guys say "too much of anything is bad for you" 

btw, if coconut oil needs to go, which oil are you promoting now?
1335 2018-08-22 21:39:50 I love running out of valve oil. I really do. It makes me incredibly happy, especially before an audition.
1336 2018-08-22 21:39:46 People who cook meat in coconut oil are the worst kind of people
1337 2018-08-22 21:39:45 You can get responsibly harvested palm oil, but yes many products containing palm oil do get it from irresponsible sources.
1338 2018-08-22 21:39:43 Faith Goldy is running for Mayor of Toronto.
Doug Ford is Premier of Ontario.
Alberta and BC had a trade war for like 2 weeks involving wine and oil.
Maxime Bernier still has Twitter.
CPC is now mad at Trudeau for calling out a woman for being racist after she said a racist thing
1339 2018-08-22 21:39:41 Vote Democrat 2018: We still lack a concrete platform or message outside of Trump Bad. 

Drop the #resist dogshit and run on a pro-worker, pro-middle class platform. Stop taking oil and pharma money. Pass single payer. Stand for your constituents and stop repeating talking points
1340 2018-08-22 21:39:33 I started making cakes with coconut oil and tbh it could be pure poison and I. Would. Not. Stop. Eating. It.
1341 2018-08-22 21:39:24 They need to make money sell books & 'trying' to stay relevant..

I know for a fact, what she has said about coconut is..
Pure poison, absolute rubbish

My grandmother lived to +

She ever only used coconut oil

Oh she's never being ill

She also still read without glasses
1342 2018-08-22 21:39:20 @jonmccomb980 Oh Jon, I really enjoy your show and I agree with most of your opinions but that clip  about pipeline vs refinery. Refined oil provides better returns with less environmenal risk. Yes it takes a while to build, but so does a pipeline.
1343 2018-08-22 21:39:19 Washing up liquid usually gets oil out of clothes!
1344 2018-08-22 21:39:18 A Wall is not going to stop a white male from killing his wife and putting his kids in an oil vat. Just saying. Don’t try to bullshit the fact that an illegal alien killed a woman and a wall will stop the killing of women. You’re thinking is irrational to solving the real problem
1345 2018-08-22 21:39:11 Wtf is CBD oil?
For uh... research purposes.
1346 2018-08-22 21:38:46 You won’t know what real OT is until your out in location for about 4/5 days straight  talk about being tired and smelling like oil and ASS but your check can pay off your car 
1347 2018-08-22 21:38:45 Okay but who was eating coconut oil? It was great in my hair but like I wasn’t just having it for breakfast. I think I might have cooked with it once but there’s no way it’s worse than Crisco so like...
1348 2018-08-22 21:38:44 Hello, queen of fake tan here. Try a bath with some cooking oil in it and then scrub it off x
1349 2018-08-22 21:38:40 My son (30} has lost loads of weight. He worked out his own diet, cut out most carbs but allowed some so he stuck to it. Mounds of salad, nuts, some cheese and meat, chilli oil as dressing. It suited him well, not for everyone. Good luck!
1350 2018-08-22 21:38:39 I wonder how much oil is left 
1351 2018-08-22 21:38:37 If you are interested in understanding the technical innovation which is driving down Alberta oil sands carbon intensity & how it compares (favourably) with other global production sources, suggest you follow @politicalham (who examines these issues through a non-Alberta lens)
1352 2018-08-22 21:38:33 Another ONE HUNDRED YEARS! My D-I-Law did the core testing. Oil will last another 100 years AT LEAST. And with new extraction methods, it WILL BE VIABLE.
1353 2018-08-22 21:38:29 Coconut oil, nature's tastiest suicide.
1354 2018-08-22 21:38:22 Hey jr.,  here in Colorado, a white male citizen murdered his pregnant wife and two little girls, he dumped the 2 girls in an oil tank, he was having an affair with a coworker,doesn’t that count for anything...more Americans kill Americans than illegals.
1355 2018-08-22 21:38:20 Word to the wise: using lavender essential oil is great for relaxed productivity but the minute you lay down you wake up 5 years later wondering where you left your keys
1356 2018-08-22 21:38:14 Lehsun oil is ok, what is dhimkaana oil?
1357 2018-08-22 21:38:14 "Coconut oil is bad for you." Most things aren't healthy in excess, but ppl are like, "This makes me glowy! i should eat it with every meal, take supplements, dry it, infuse it, grind it to a fine powder, snort it, shove it up my ass and wear it as an amulet!" Just fucking chill.
1358 2018-08-22 21:38:00 Thanks @GOP @realDonaldTrump because of your "brilliant" trade wars and tax cuts I will now pay $94 more a month on my home heating oil and my mortgage went up by $120/m AND I can NO LONGER CLAIM my S.A.L.T on my taxes yeah!
#FuckTrump
1359 2018-08-22 21:37:52 Obama was the greatest snake oil salesman in the annals of history.
1360 2018-08-22 21:37:50 Some good glugs of olive oil instead perhaps.
1361 2018-08-22 21:37:49 A brush and some beard shears and oil softener.
1362 2018-08-22 21:37:33 And I see no #EnvironmentalJustice groups, groups representing #Tribal interests or people of color. Maybe instead of #greenwashing it is #WhiteWashing? @JerryBrownGov has been terrible with oil and gas. Now he is moving to #coal. #StopAB813.
1363 2018-08-22 21:37:30 I have never heard of coconut oil being a health trend.
1364 2018-08-22 21:37:27 If you think it is about oil price think again
1365 2018-08-22 21:37:17 Yeah honestly, he shouldn’t have bother. He needs to stick with drenching everything in olive oil.
1366 2018-08-22 21:37:03 People are losing their minds over Coconut Oil being pure poison to eat.
1367 2018-08-22 21:36:54 Literally bought a jar this morning for a hair mask, (add grape seed oil and olive oil too!) And was so paranoid she was going to say bad for cosmetic purposes! I'm not eating it! I'm deep conditioning!
1368 2018-08-22 21:36:39 coconut oil is trending & idk what i believe ....
1369 2018-08-22 21:36:34 Granted, I still kinda scrabble to find the hood release, but y’know. Oil/wiper fluid/antifreeze/changing headlights I’ll look in the manual. Not 100% old yet!
1370 2018-08-22 21:36:23 Deflection. Distraction. Pay no mind to the man behind the curtain. He’s a snake oil salesman. #ImpeachTrump
1371 2018-08-22 21:36:18 No you're fine.
1372 2018-08-22 21:36:15 Coconut oil is healthy one day n poison the other... smh... stress, tension  and worrying r the true poison... worst than any food...
1373 2018-08-22 21:36:11 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1374 2018-08-22 21:35:59 And Ian Wood agreed it was 'runing out'. He was just as responsible and he STILL doesn't want Indy. Why would he? We'll CHARGE MORE for oil to set up an Oil fund for hard times. He won't get his oil free anymore!
1375 2018-08-22 21:35:44 **slides in DM for that oil $$$**
1376 2018-08-22 21:35:44 I’ve never cooked w coconut oil only keep that afro shine on my brown body nadamean. But makes sense lol
1377 2018-08-22 21:35:44 @HeatCalculation going to do my local village hall. Looking at a ASHP and solar PV. Presently running a 16year old oil boiler.
1378 2018-08-22 21:35:39 all this coconut oil nazi is proving is how stupid harvard is and that theyre in on the scam
1379 2018-08-22 21:35:26 Submit that to the National Endowment for the Arts as an interpretative expression of modern day liberal's raison d'etre in 'oil' and hope for a grant!
1380 2018-08-22 21:35:26 I bought Brain Octane oil from Amazon. Used MCT Oil before but it gave me “disaster pants” 
1381 2018-08-22 21:35:17 Hey, #WestVirginia, coal’s rate of collapse to be ‘more than twice’ what analysts previously projected. Trump's selling snake oil. Are you buying?
1382 2018-08-22 21:35:15 Wait so coconut oil is the worst oil to eat and cook with? Lmao I’m weak as fuck man
1383 2018-08-22 21:35:09 でかい大黒様もいるしね！ちゃんとお参りもしてきたので御利益あるといいなー

1386 2018-08-22 21:35:05 Prophecy or Madness- Just read John Bolton state 'US to drive Iranain oil exports to zero'. Why is USA fixated on a occult programme that has them believe in the usual 4 suspects North Korea, China , Russia and Iran as their ONLY enemies.
1387 2018-08-22 21:34:59 I eat oatmeal every day and cook all my meats with coconut oil. If my life expectancy hasn't been cut in half by now i want my money back
1388 2018-08-22 21:34:46 SHITE.. Even without the oil, Scotland can flourish as an Independent nation.  £60 Billion raised in Scotland,(not including 92% of oil revenues that goes to WM), £30 Billion pocket money handed back. #DissolveTheUnion 
1389 2018-08-22 21:34:44 Add it to the list:
- weird salad dressings
- moisturize cuticles
- fratricide

Someday that’s gonna be a Jeopardy! answer for the question “What is coconut oil used for?”
1390 2018-08-22 21:34:37 Lol, I knew it was a typo, just giving you a hard time. BTW, peppermint oil has been a lifesaver. It cools the body off and keeps me from getting dizzy. Just make sure it’s 100% pure and organic. If it bothers your skin mix with coconut oil or almond oil.
1391 2018-08-22 21:34:33 All Europe, Russia and everywhere has to stop support palm oil production which is destroying their habitats and needed greenery for world health. Nice story, but it's humans who destroy or support environment destruction. No zoos needed. No circuses EVER, but instead preserve.
1392 2018-08-22 21:34:26 Can't wait to be live for tonight's stream! Still gotta get an oil change, go to the gym, come home and eat 
1393 2018-08-22 21:34:22 Both benefit from agreements that they have free movement of people. Norway in the EEA takes rules, pays for them & has no say. Do u have any idea how wealthy Norway is? They invested all their oil money in a sovereign wealth fund decades ago. We dribbled ours away.
1394 2018-08-22 21:34:21 The link is a Scot gov publication and does include oil (no idea about whisky)
1395 2018-08-22 21:34:03 No we need coal and oil wells
1396 2018-08-22 21:34:02 I hear ye! Kept telling people my daughter-i-L did all core testing for Scottish oil fields 2013/2014. She told me (& I was telling everyone), there will be oil for at least 100 YEARS! specially with new extraction techniques coming on line! Still works in oil. Says still MORE!
1397 2018-08-22 21:33:51 My father-in-law could do pie crust with oil; I need something with more oomph.  Or I just need more practice
1398 2018-08-22 21:33:49 Man, you wanna talk about hysterical... Coconut oil is not pure poison, for crying out loud.

Also I love how we haven't learned our lesson about fat. Ooooo scary saturated fats! Oooh eating fat will raise your cholesterol!

Will it? Will it really? Are you *100%* on that? 
1399 2018-08-22 21:33:48 Yaani......they’ve been very quiet about it all summer. They’re happy with oil price and now Iran will be slapped with sanctions. Stars are aligning in their favor. IPO was an unnecessary distraction for Saudi. McKinsey made their money. Time for a refund?
1400 2018-08-22 21:33:46 But there are no studies showing the health benefits to coconut oil! And that’s what people are buying into. The UK has seen around a stupid 2000% increase in sales of it over like 3 years and I believe mainly down to the advertisement of it being ‘healthy and good for you’.
1401 2018-08-22 21:33:42 Dick Hannah. I get free oil changes for the next 2 years with my Jeep Wave Program.
1402 2018-08-22 21:33:33 Great for oil pulling teeth in any event.
1403 2018-08-22 21:33:30 are they saying coconut oil is unhealthy for a reason other than that it is oil
1404 2018-08-22 21:33:17 What an idiot, does't even know that the block grant doesn't pay for Social Security benefits, State pensions, defence, foreign aid etc. As for oil revenue, 469 billion is more than every country in the middle east combined.

1408 2018-08-22 21:32:57 Who eats coconut oil? It's only good for your hair. Not good for the skin because it clogs your pores.
1409 2018-08-22 21:32:57 Seeing this as I add 3 tablespoons of MCT oil into my water. 
1410 2018-08-22 21:32:56 Dear Santa, 
for Christmas this year, I would really like a fresh oil change so that my car is no longer 2000 miles overdue. 
If you could also throw in two new brake lights, that’d be great considering both of mine are out. Sincerely, 
an irresponsible car owner
1411 2018-08-22 21:32:47 You know if you cook Kale in coconut oil .. it is easier to scrap into the garbage ..
1412 2018-08-22 21:32:44 Exactly!Countries in the middle east dripping in oil are buying their way into free nations, implementing sharia law and killing innocent people. The world leaders are turning a blind eye because they are the ones selling their countries to the highest bidder #DemocratsPlaybook
1413 2018-08-22 21:32:39 The Coconut oil thing I really don’t get, it was what we coated ourselves with to get a really dark Tan in the 70’s. Now its a super food. I didn’t use it then, and I’m still not.  Coconut is best for Macroons!
1414 2018-08-22 21:32:39 Would Trump ignore the USA’s oil? The Tories do talk such twaddle! @NicolaSturgeon @AlexSalmond
1415 2018-08-22 21:32:39 But they have loads of oil and money ????
1416 2018-08-22 21:32:34 A little sesame oil is good, too.
1417 2018-08-22 21:32:33 Coconut oil slander will not be tolerated
1418 2018-08-22 21:32:32 Also, times changed. Oil price rebounded. Outlook for demand almost stable in years to come. From gtg, selling ur cash cow was mistake. Politicswise, ramifications might've included long term public/family opposition, MBS was reversing 'nationalization' of Aramco even at 5%.
1419 2018-08-22 21:32:31 @KenDBerryMD Are so-called prestigious universities and journals losing their minds? Professor at Harvard claiming coconut oil is "pure poison" because of saturated fat. #mediaspreadinglies #badinformation #ketofood
1420 2018-08-22 21:32:29 thank you for your moral support.
yes, the main problem here is that s.a. has got the world by the balls because they have the oil.
in canada and elsewhere around the world there is a trend to get away from oil...thus get away fro s.a.
1421 2018-08-22 21:32:25 I literally feel like I just rubbed oil and dirt alllllllll on my face
1422 2018-08-22 21:32:24 Basically I’m saying this should have happened 15-18 years ago. This would be like watching hulk hogan and Randy savage oil up and wrestle right now. No thanks.
1423 2018-08-22 21:32:21 I had a coach before. He said to remove the innards and put oil on the rubber plunger (not sure if that is the right term) as it dries out and shrinks. Putting oil on it nourishes it and you can then spread out the rubber so it is airtight
1424 2018-08-22 21:32:08 Ima check them out next time. I ain’t know they did oil changes.
1425 2018-08-22 21:32:06 coconut oil is not pure poison. it’s just high in fat. it’s not healthy but it’s not poison.
1426 2018-08-22 21:32:06 But coconut oil is both solid and liquid?
1427 2018-08-22 21:31:59 Iran deal gone. Sanctions being reinstated and Iran's oil trade choked. Oil prices starting to rise again. Saudis think there is no need for ARAMCO listing as oil prices will go back to $90-100/bbl soon.
1428 2018-08-22 21:31:52 I will take the coconut oil over....McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, all chicken joints, red lobster, chillis, arbys & 95% of the crap the grocery stores sell! Unless you buy fresh daily & cook yourself....it's all poison!
1429 2018-08-22 21:31:51 Let me guess, it’s funded by canola or palm oil companies? That’s actual bad oil.
1430 2018-08-22 21:31:50 i still maintain it was a terrible idea to make a cuticle oil that smells like watermelon bubble yum
1431 2018-08-22 21:31:48 Bullshit we need oil and gas.
1432 2018-08-22 21:31:48 I do Oil Changes! If anybody need their oil changed in their car HMP. Oil changes are $30 must have correct oil and oil filter.
1433 2018-08-22 21:31:44 I keep seeing this oil diffuser and well, do I need it? Because I’m very tempted.
1434 2018-08-22 21:31:38 never bought the coconut oil hype
1435 2018-08-22 21:31:27 I think the scrapping of the Aramco deal is hugely bullish for oil because now they won't have to pump so much oil to make the quarter.
1436 2018-08-22 21:31:26 They said it may not be good to eat Coconut oil they didn’t say anything about rubbing it on your body 
1437 2018-08-22 21:31:25 Well, what are we supposed to use now? Olive oil is “no bueno” for cooking and now coconut has been “declared” 
1438 2018-08-22 21:31:13 Sometimes a parent dies too young. If you are lucky they leave something amazing behind. @johnlennon left @seanonolennon the masterpiece, Beautiful Boy. My dad left me an eggplant parmigiana recipe that is so fried it uses two bottles of oil.
1439 2018-08-22 21:31:11 How's the snake oil you bought?  You gotta do some serious mental gymnastics to think you're "winning".
1440 2018-08-22 21:31:10 Who paid for this study the canola and corn oil producers? This this sounds fishy to me.
1441 2018-08-22 21:31:01 Cheers. I originally started with energy in EROEI terms, years back when Peak Oil seemed to be a thing. I find it fraught these days, especially as a way for a researcher to punish a disfavoured energy source - just bake pessimistic assumptions in for it.
1442 2018-08-22 21:31:00 Thank you ! And I’m not sure about the oil but the balm I’m sure you can
1443 2018-08-22 21:30:57 Let’s c if this castor oil myth really works
1444 2018-08-22 21:30:55 Really??? Other oil countries certainly do! What a load of ABSOLUTE CODSWOLLOP!!

1464 2018-08-22 21:29:16 Not sure Germany is a good example in your favour of your argument? Look at their relationship with Russia/Gasprom -  Renewables are viable but the essential addiction to crude oil is 2-fold - 1. extremely high energy content and 2. versatility to make very wide range of products
1465 2018-08-22 21:29:12 If only oil was state-owned and not being extracted by private companies eh.
1466 2018-08-22 21:29:01 I'm not surprised anymore by violence,, especially by men. Look at that guy that just killed his wife & 2 little girls & threw them in oil barrels. Than goes on TV

1472 2018-08-22 21:28:44 coconut oil is better than other fats out on the market tho imo. soooo. also coconut oil is sooo good for skincare to i love it

1521 2018-08-22 21:24:30 The more the #FakeNewsMedia vilifies high fat diets, coconut oil, red meat, and butter the more I incorporate it in my diet. 

With that being said, any “expert” health advise promoted by MSM should be disregarded and reverse immediately!!!

1522 2018-08-22 21:24:20 This should be funded 100% by the oil companies. There should not be one penny of public money.
1523 2018-08-22 21:24:15 Have some coconut oil lol
1524 2018-08-22 21:23:46 THATS SO FUNNY. I literally threw out my coconut oil TODAY! 
But it is talking about consuming it, I used it for beauty reasons lol (which turned it to also be bad)
1525 2018-08-22 21:23:41 Here’s some constructive criticism: it doesn’t really help that you’re a giant fuckwad moron.

Great job getting your mother into crypto before obviously inevitable regulation legislation got passed by any major government, though. You seem like a real bright snake oil salesman.
1526 2018-08-22 21:23:38 The point he was making, in a hilariously dramatic way, was that coconut oil has higher saturated fat than alternatives like olive oil, so you shouldn’t use it as an everyday cooking oil. Which is true, but it’s fine for you occasional things like baking where it works better.
1527 2018-08-22 21:23:36 Coconut oil is an excellent carrier
1528 2018-08-22 21:23:19 Can I used the marula oil in my face?
1529 2018-08-22 21:23:13 Oil painting and leaving the window closed was not a smart idea :'D
1530 2018-08-22 21:23:12 Since when is it good to ingest any type of oil? #CoconutOil
1531 2018-08-22 21:23:10 It’s still patchy in the middle but I’ve been using growth oil to fill it in
1532 2018-08-22 21:23:05 We had an oil painting  I was stamping on ohh they managed  to pull the canvas round
1533 2018-08-22 21:23:02 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
1534 2018-08-22 21:22:54 We have been using C oil since generations. Our longevity only has been increasing. Thanks to this kind of reasearch!!
1535 2018-08-22 21:22:50 tea tree oil helped me. i just put a little on a qtip, and that helped out
1536 2018-08-22 21:22:46 Face oil will change your life, I tell ya.
1537 2018-08-22 21:22:40 All my family members use coconut oil for all the cooking and maybe olive oil sometimes and we all r in good health. Really can't trust modern day research as one day one thing super good and next day it's poison? Unbelievable
1538 2018-08-22 21:22:33 Ooh hazel king, I’m getting ripped myself.  Want to oil my body down for a hot massage?  Don’t forget the agave.

1546 2018-08-22 21:22:02 There's people in certain parts of the world that have become immune to many foods that cause people to get very sick and other parts of the world
 Coconut in the raw form is fine and there is oil in the raw form as well
It's all how it's processed and eaten.
1547 2018-08-22 21:21:54 Me equivoque mobil oil es de ellos...aunque a esta altura tienen casi todo el monopolio

1551 2018-08-22 21:21:21 sooooooo bad for you :(( use sunflower oil, vitamin e oil, or shea butter instead!!!!!

& then while theyre changing the oil they show me my basically blackened filters
& ask how I'm able to drive with alignment "that bad"

I'm too broke to fix it all at once tho

1564 2018-08-22 21:20:31 Haifa oil refinery was constructed in 1932, huge pipes were made to transfer the Iraqi oil pumped from oil wells in Kirkuk to Haifa refinery and port to be exported, it stopped working when Palestine was occupied in 1948, 22 August 2018.
1565 2018-08-22 21:20:27 If you think watching this show makes you some individual with ‘heightened intelligence’ than I have some snake oil I’d like to sell you.
1566 2018-08-22 21:20:23 can't wait to see that happening :P
data will not be the new oil, data is already the new oil!
1567 2018-08-22 21:20:16 Fuck Harvard ima eat a spoon of coconut oil.

1570 2018-08-22 21:20:09 The Drumpf Cult looks for their new flavor. This Snake Oil Man has got it ... Elite Kool-Aid ... that's the name of the game ... just  for them, the forgotten people. Health care? Who needs it? Drink that man's Elitist Kool-Aid ... I'm telling you, Folks .. we're almost there.
1571 2018-08-22 21:19:58 Nothing wrong with cc oil except it’s relatively empty calories. It’s high in MCT oil and can enhance ketosis, which might be beneficial for those using it for that purpose.
1572 2018-08-22 21:19:57 I’ve obtained the script for The Big Bang Theory series finale. Don’t ask me how. It appears that all of the characters except Sheldon will die from having consumed too much coconut oil during the first 11 seasons.
1573 2018-08-22 21:19:53 Who’s using oil to melt cheese
1574 2018-08-22 21:19:47 shocked to come online and discover coconut oil has fat in it?! oh well, guess I'll have to go back to eating whole sticks of butter
1575 2018-08-22 21:19:46 Chris Watts murdered his own babies and put them in an oil barrel. Where did he immigrate here from?
1576 2018-08-22 21:19:46 a 2 hour drive turned into a 5 hour drive, all due to a lorry flipped over and leaking oil!!!
1577 2018-08-22 21:19:43 What do you think the oil taste like?
1578 2018-08-22 21:19:41 Thanks for that - a very touching piece, indeed. Loved the line “add sesame oil until it tastes like Mom’s” ha... lucky to have an H Mart here in downtown Vancouver!

1588 2018-08-22 21:19:00 DYK @Plenish high oleic soybean oil has 0g trans fat, less saturated fat & the highest heart-healthy monounsaturated fat available in soy? Brian Buckallew, @Corteva specialty soybeans business manager, will explain more at the US Soy Global Trade Exchange/@MidwestShippers Conf.
1589 2018-08-22 21:18:50 Except that's not true of Coconu Oil (or ANY other fat.) Butter doesn't turn into butter in your studies, either. ALL fats are broken down into glycerol/fatty acids, thence used or broken down further into glucose...& MANY other studies show Coconut Oil to be very beneficial.
1590 2018-08-22 21:18:36 Not one single Britnat, there’s a surprise. Billions of £s of North Sea oil exported directly from the source and not regarded as a Scottish export is all you need to show just how farcical #GERS is in regards to the wealth of an independent Scotland
1591 2018-08-22 21:18:33 Why would something natural be poison or unhealthy i love coconut oil i use it for everything
1592 2018-08-22 21:18:32 Lol, where is the hard science for or against coconut oil? I could care less how people, non-experts and experts alike “rate” it
1593 2018-08-22 21:18:27 @foundmyfitness I’m curious what your take is on the Harvard professor who is making headlines for calling coconut oil “pure poison”?
1594 2018-08-22 21:18:25 The problem with unconventional oil is its disastrous climate implications, with far worse net energy return. We need non-fossil alternatives STAT! And, if hydrogen, from electrolysis via renewables, not from brown coal!
1595 2018-08-22 21:18:16 FAT DOESN'T CAUSE FAT OR ARTERY BLOCKAGES!! Please get with the current science. Substitute "sugar & carbs" for "coconut oil" and the word poison is accurate.
1596 2018-08-22 21:18:13 No one knows the long term effects of eating a lot of coconut oil. There are no long-term studies on it. The long-term studies on saturated fat that the AHA relied on to say saturated fats are bad are seriously flawed. No reason to think it is poison, or especially healthy.
1597 2018-08-22 21:18:12 These same people will say don't  politicize a school shooting yet they politicized the hell out this. As long as Americans are killing Americans they don't care. There was no mention of the man who killed his pregnant wife and two daughters and stuff their bodies in oil barrels.

1599 2018-08-22 21:17:58 Hahaha. So let's all pretend it's not there. 

I look forward to BBC Scotlands 'Oil - Scotland's Burden' up & coming series of reports that will be in the pipeline.
1600 2018-08-22 21:17:51 Question: How much of taxes raised raised in Scotland e.g. oil & whisky are returned to Scotland?
1601 2018-08-22 21:17:48 Worst thing you can do to your body. I use coconut and olive oils and sometimes avocado oil anything else it's all fake and bad for the body. Love your posts keep them coming.
1602 2018-08-22 21:17:40 Might the 'Coconut oil is pure poison' findings be funded by man who sits under coconut tree?
1603 2018-08-22 21:17:37 I wish dry shampoo got rid of my problems like it gets rid of the excess oil in my hair
1604 2018-08-22 21:17:17 Coconut oil is not for consumption! It’s been used as hair oil by Indians for century.
1605 2018-08-22 21:17:10 70 dollars is too much for an oil change
1606 2018-08-22 21:17:09 Had a Frantz bypass filter on my 2000 Golf Diesel. Oil reports were great.

1610 2018-08-22 21:17:02 If the gas and oil of the world priced in another currency(ies) rather than the dollar, the dollar would lose its control over the world.
1611 2018-08-22 21:16:57 The only sources of saturated fat are from plant oils and animal products. Unless u use oil a ton it shouldn’t be a concern. Plus nuts and seeds have poly- and mono-unsaturated fats which do your body some good
1612 2018-08-22 21:16:47 Funny, was talking with a dietician yesterday, and the two things she really did not like where keto and coconut oil. Ha.
1613 2018-08-22 21:16:42 Clean your brushes with a mix of olive oil and dish soap!
1614 2018-08-22 21:16:42 Soooo, back from head shrinkers office. Head is still the same size, no MJ oil to help me sleep. Apparently the oil won’t work for sleep, only the smoked MJ does so I’m outta luck. Gonna get neurologist’s opinion next month but Lordy I’m tired. Any1 got a sledgehammer?
1615 2018-08-22 21:16:33 Honest Question: Am I trash for reading how poisonous coconut oil is to eat and being confused AF that people were using it for non-hair related reasons?
1616 2018-08-22 21:16:32 Then what about your entire life which you have lived? Is it all pointless? 
The thing is not about the best or the worst days, it is about being content and accepting what happens in life. #justmyopinion
1617 2018-08-22 21:16:29 Yeah olive oil is an overall great choice in the kitchen for nearly everything
1618 2018-08-22 21:16:24 Yeah fair enough, I get you now.

Grilled asparagus stalks with flakey salt drizzled with olive oil, and roasted bell peppers stuffed with bacon and shrooms and diced habaneros... mmmmmmmm
1619 2018-08-22 21:16:10 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.

1623 2018-08-22 21:15:49 It's no secret that the region drills for oil/gas and in some areas of the world there's a relationship to oil/gas drilling and earthquakes happening so checkout all the country's infrastructures @justtrini1

1625 2018-08-22 21:15:30 It is when natrual, my mom used it instead of baby oil on all of us, her mom used it on her and so on. All this "it gets hard if it's in a cool room" shit is the FDA tryna kill us with the latest trend. I'd rather have family make it and send it.
1626 2018-08-22 21:15:21 uh huh..coconut oil is evil,  but becel margerine is sponsered by the heart and stroke foundation.. dont believe everything they tell you on the mainstream new people #QAnon
1627 2018-08-22 21:15:16 I travel to Sanibel Island every year, what a shame. This is what happens when you spill oil, run off, and industrial waste in to our waters. The EPA is encouraging this behavior. So sad.
1628 2018-08-22 21:14:55 Finally jumped on the CBD oil bandwagon but I’m struggling to find legit info on dosing etc

1632 2018-08-22 21:14:34 Snake oil is.
1633 2018-08-22 21:14:33 is it possible that there’s always a new magic ingredient waiting just around the corner? coconut oil this time will get swapped out for nordic licorice root extract or crushed rye seeds, until cassava makes its triumphant return.
1634 2018-08-22 21:14:32 I don't usually notice it a huuuge deal, I'm pretty used to baking stuff in olive oil though. This kinda stuff is always nice cause it makes it crispy. I usually bake any kind of chicken like this.
1635 2018-08-22 21:14:19 Thinking seriously about writing a book about the crisis in #Venezuela... with a focus on its oil and gas crisis.. #oott
1636 2018-08-22 21:14:15 Okay but even with that coconut oil “truth bomb” supposedly being dropped... I’m still gonna use it for the 999 other external uses it’s perfect for
1637 2018-08-22 21:14:11 News flash: It takes oil, at about equal measures, to grow food. Using domestic oil MEANS food independence. Fertilizer and tractors all use oil.

1642 2018-08-22 21:13:57 Not with thc oil ...
its great!
1643 2018-08-22 21:13:53 The answer is no, and why does it even matter? One does not need to work for Bitcoin to understand that Trump and basic economics are like oil and water.
1644 2018-08-22 21:13:53 Never use it. Maybe it's best as a moisturizer, but prefer argan oil.
1645 2018-08-22 21:13:51 Hey Amy have you tried the cannabis oil from Holland & Barrett? I'm going to try some for my anxiety but I have heard great thing about it, my nan even takes it for all her pains. I thought maybe it could help you Xx I'm also always around if you need a chat X
1646 2018-08-22 21:13:49 Yesss!! I only use coconut oil for these purposes. It keeps my hair happy and nourished!
1647 2018-08-22 21:13:41 what is lehsun oil?
1648 2018-08-22 21:13:28 I have but didn't keep up with it. Tried sesame and coconut oil. Both were enjoyable. I didn't like spitting in the trash but didn't want to spit outside and attract bears. If I can figure out better disposal I'd try again.
1649 2018-08-22 21:13:25 The snake oil salesman got an answer for everything, we call it whining
1650 2018-08-22 21:13:15 A poor girl is murdered and you hate-peddling racists use her as a political tool? Shame on you. Where’s the outrage over other murders? What about the father who just killed his daughters and stuck them in an oil tank? Freaking hypocrites. #MollieTibbetts

1655 2018-08-22 21:13:00 Its simple and unpalatable. The US health market makes so much money they are treated same as oil co's. They see health channel worldwide as such. Any preference for NHS anti competitive!
1656 2018-08-22 21:12:48 It’s not snake oil man. I’ve used it for my arthritis and it works. Different strokes for different folks. My point about alcohol is that it is way more dangerous overall. Yet it’s legal and we accept that. I’ve seen both stoners and alcoholics, alcoholics are much worse
1657 2018-08-22 21:12:47 There is a couple of things,  1 unconventional oil,  tar sands,  shale oil were still in infancy. 2 electric transport,  was no where it is today.  Hundred dollar oil hadn't cratered the world economy.  Gfc.  not crook mortgages in Cleveland. We are living on a plateau of oil

1663 2018-08-22 21:11:52 I remember that my dad worked as a union operator at a oil refinery and he said they worluld promote members to management to make sure they would not literally blow things up.
1664 2018-08-22 21:11:45 COCONUT OIL IS NOT HEALTHY
1665 2018-08-22 21:11:42 And using a stolen or fake ID to pass the verification check does make him here legally, in case you try to bring up his lawyer’s claim that he was here legally.
1666 2018-08-22 21:11:40 I'm seeing lots of Beto signs in the rich hood these are people who got rich off oil in West Texas
1667 2018-08-22 21:11:33 In a pan, with some olive oil.
1668 2018-08-22 21:11:15 @balberts4 This is a false syllogism. Unbelievable.  We can’t do much about deranged citizens since they have the right to be here and can’t be arrested until doing crime. The same cannot be said for those who enter our country illegally. This is an asinine take.
1669 2018-08-22 21:11:14 Leave my coconut oil alone. 

Y’all said low-fat was good, once.  Big scam. Too simple. 

It’s not like people eat jars and jars of coconut oil, for fuck sake.  

“Studies” are often poison.
1670 2018-08-22 21:11:11 I went on my first overseas tour to SA in 95/95 And everyone after for the next 15 years including trips to Pakistan and Bangladesh so don't lecture me on atmosphere at cricket. There's a difference to oil drums in the Caribbean and the repetitive shit from Billy the trumpet
1671 2018-08-22 21:11:08 Agreed. I use is sparingly and only occasionally.  Bathe my food in olive oil! No animal fat.
1672 2018-08-22 21:11:05 no matter what banker are makin’ money
1673 2018-08-22 21:11:04 As Midnight Oil always say.. "we got to give it back..."
1674 2018-08-22 21:11:03 A true leader for our future would be mapping renewable energy sites, Lisa. 

Sorry you are unable to see the vast clean energy we have all around us, when you take oil donations.
1675 2018-08-22 21:11:01 You'd make a great court artist though. I can see you now, gripping the oil pastels in your talons
1676 2018-08-22 21:10:58 North Korean chemistry labs were raided in the "wee" hours and what was found was another Zapata Oil Drilling Services rescue mission aborted by anybody who knows anything about "Fox and Friends" and their take on "Golgi" all the way without the pain of "doing it".
1677 2018-08-22 21:10:55 So much misinformation going around about fats. Saturated fats are bad in excess because they can easily pack together, solidify, and cause artery narrowing. Coconut oil is mostly saturated fat- olive, sunflower, corn, etc. contain much less. As such, they're generally healthier.
1678 2018-08-22 21:10:40 I put my veggie burger on veggie oil in the pan and I honestly thought something magical was going to happen 
1679 2018-08-22 21:10:39 is harvard really tryna tell me coconut oil is poison lmaoooooo
1680 2018-08-22 21:10:39 I live about 40 miles south of the oil tanks where the children were found and I will tell you, that white folks here in Colorado want this man already executed for his crimes.
1681 2018-08-22 21:10:34 Ronda says it's okay to eat if you are eating the organic coconut oil.
1682 2018-08-22 21:10:15 So i gave some labourers assisting my Dad on rice plantation foreign groundnut oil and detergent as a token of my appreciation for their countless help; a particular one sum up courage to inquire what/use of the bottle content as it was new to him. He was happy at the discovery
1683 2018-08-22 21:10:15 But HuckaSpawn got the early lie in.

And no one is talking about the family killer who dumped his kids in oil drums.

What could be different?
1684 2018-08-22 21:10:12 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this August? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
1685 2018-08-22 21:10:12 Coconut oil is worse than lard?!? I’m shook
1686 2018-08-22 21:10:08 語彙力の無さが・・

1688 2018-08-22 21:10:00 Our renewable resources are scarce (clean air@and water for example) and our non-renewables are abundant (oil, gas). Why? Our policies are wrong and markets are not allowed to work.
1689 2018-08-22 21:09:57 Actually,  with an indepth look,  that's well possible. Sustainable?  That I can't vouch for. 
1. 10% cut in govt budget will do magic. 
2. "Presidential" grants alone already tells you there's free university. Smw
3. 75b for laptops?
4. >50% interest in oil x°?
1690 2018-08-22 21:09:47 Oil of oregano underneath your tongue
1691 2018-08-22 21:09:46 Your skin will thank you so much for it! Look into oil pulling for your skin it gives a lot more insight on cleaning your pores naturally!
1692 2018-08-22 21:09:37 Stay with oil burners, it's the way forward.
1693 2018-08-22 21:09:04 He thinks you're jollof rice. He wants to add some kings oil. 
1694 2018-08-22 21:09:02 The brain needs good fat this guy is a quack let’s all eat fast food cooked with vegetable oil get sick and treat the system make money for the health care industry
1695 2018-08-22 21:08:47 Saudi Arabia is ISIS.  The only reason every country in the world bends over backwards to them, is their money and oil.
1696 2018-08-22 21:08:44 I love the oil money. It's what has transformed us from mid-table plodders to the best and most exciting football team in England. I hope we keep on spending more and more millions from the ever increasing price rises of oil! Every time you fill up we're buying another title! 
1697 2018-08-22 21:08:33 A poor girl is murdered and you hate-peddling racists use her as a political tool? Shame on you. Where’s the outrage over other murders? What about the father who just killed his daughters and stuck them in an oil tank? Freaking hypocrites.
1698 2018-08-22 21:08:14 Oi! I can't even fathom the ppl who fall for that. Where are all the snake oil salesppl? A huge market has been primed for them!
1699 2018-08-22 21:08:11 Let me guess, just don’t eat nothing but coconut oil? Just like every other food humans have ever eaten? Shame moderation isn’t headline grabbing click-bait material. Have to admit I’m glad of the reference to lard in the article. Feel less bad about the halfpack in the fridge...
1700 2018-08-22 21:07:55 @LuvzTech l think l deserve a good nights sleep after this day Steven! I watched few episodes of "Mc Giver", rather pleasant to see  weatherwoman said next days will as much beautiful as today, l gonna enjoy to get a beautiful tan  lot of sun oil for those first days 
1701 2018-08-22 21:07:45 Dear Dr. anger is not good for your health. Use mustard seed oil for healthy scalp &cool head. And no I am not an upper-middle-class bhabhi type.

1705 2018-08-22 21:07:12 not like i use coconut oil for cooking anyways
1706 2018-08-22 21:07:09 I am a robot. I piss oil
1707 2018-08-22 21:07:09 i just need the heat to stop. mi oil already a ride mi. di heat nain a help
1708 2018-08-22 21:07:09 Looks like coconut oil is the new epidemic.
1709 2018-08-22 21:07:09 People really need to calm the fock down going bonkers over this crap. 
Anything and everything gets this bunch of folks worked up! 
It's a professor. "A" person. 

And he's NOT taking your coconut oil away!! Yeah the non-poisonous one!
#coconutoil
1710 2018-08-22 21:06:54 Exactly and idk about anyone else but whatever “coconut oil” they using in these shampoos and conditioners etc it’s very drying. It does little to nothing so I don’t even bother plus coconut oil does not do much for my hair but pile up and break my face out. 
1711 2018-08-22 21:06:53 Scotland would now be bankrupt if they had voted for independence in 2014, with North Sea crude oil below break even for so long, and no longer receiving a disproportionate amount of UK tax receipts. They would have been like Greece. #FACT #SNPout #indyref #indyref2 #Scotland
1712 2018-08-22 21:06:41 I jumped on the coconut oil bandwagon years ago when it first became the “newest fad”... I can’t recall anything happening to me within the couple yrs I used it, I just recall I didn’t care for it much.  I’m on the fence with this one.
1713 2018-08-22 21:06:39 Here's my verse for the day.

Proverbs 21:20 NASBS There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, But a foolish man swallows it up.
#Proverbs21_20
1714 2018-08-22 21:06:37 Power steering fluid and it’s almost time for a oil change
1715 2018-08-22 21:06:30 so it’s nice when Barrett discovers Oil fields in Advent Children and tells cloud but it’s a slight at some of the issues we already have in real life
1716 2018-08-22 21:06:28 Dec 2016 TTMYGM had fascinating article about how oil came to be priced in us$ in the 1st place and how that is now ending.
1717 2018-08-22 21:06:26 I was underneath my unit changing the oil and a car pulls up. I crawl out from under it and the guy goes “oh! You’re a woman!” “Uh yeah... what’s wrong? you don’t think girls can change oil or that we can’t be cops?” “uhh... um... look I just need to file a report...” 

1718 2018-08-22 21:06:23 Terrified of an oil truck hose coming loose from the tank and showering me with fuel oil. Happened to me when I was 11 - I still cross the street when I see a truck filling up a building’s tank.
1719 2018-08-22 21:06:20 Maybe that's why wypipo always skinny, they dont have that fatty acids from the oil 
1720 2018-08-22 21:06:18 Venezuela is under an economic imbargo, locked out of the global banking system unable to sell oil its main resource on global markets among other major sanctions. Maduros mismanagement is one factor but it's disingenuous to suggest US is not playing major role.
1721 2018-08-22 21:06:15 I was putting oil in my car at a gas station and this gentlemen walked up and said silly woman... and walked away. No other comment or explanation.
1722 2018-08-22 21:06:14 It is impossible to mess up homemade pizza. Flour, yeast, olive oil, water.
TOmato puree and shed loads of cheese on the top.
1723 2018-08-22 21:06:12 Is coconut oil bad to put on your skin?
1724 2018-08-22 21:06:06 the fad is coconut oil now. you can thank marketing for that. that's how all of this works. fat-free, low fat, sugar free, glutton free.. money spent on marketing and people eager for a quick fix.
1725 2018-08-22 21:06:01 Headline: “Is coconut oil bad for you?”  Who cares? I don’t eat that shit, I use it for jock itch, dry spots, and lube. Totally safe for all orifices but your mouf.
1726 2018-08-22 21:05:49 Foods should be rated among their substitutes in consumption. Coconut oil is the second worst fat for you after butter, worse than olive, rapeseed, peanut or soybean oils, avocado, even worse than cheese.
1727 2018-08-22 21:05:34 today i deadass forgot olive oil existed
1728 2018-08-22 21:05:15 Vegetable oil is crap
1729 2018-08-22 21:05:13 the ladies at fanfic open mic told us in no uncertain terms that coconut oil is not lube
1730 2018-08-22 21:04:38 Looking for a container for your several gallons of crude or refined oil that you will then send globe-trotting to its final destination, but can’t fit all of it cupped in your hands? Look no further than the barrel
1731 2018-08-22 21:04:11 Well you know, when all you can afford is two grains of rice and a scoop of coconut oil you're not going to get obese whereas the most people in the west are wealthy enough to eat their way to death and are accustomed to overeating. Don't get butthurt, it's clearly a hyperbole.
1732 2018-08-22 21:04:03 Side note factoid, coconut oil is gaining in popularity in the sex industry as a natural lubricant...dont ask how i know that lol
1733 2018-08-22 21:03:57 Also, the report mentions peak oil, which I suspect we've passed, but little to nothing is heard of it these days. There was an organisation, ASPO, dedicated to studying it, which has gone very quiet. I must look for its website...
1734 2018-08-22 21:03:48 More than 5 tweets a day...you are nervous and running scared...trying to snake oil your base!  A big bus will be pulling up to the WH soon.  Jail is awaiting for you, Junior and the rest of your inner circle!
1735 2018-08-22 21:03:46 @MnGop murderers come from all walks of life.  Example, man from CO murders pregnant wife and his own little girls.  Stashes his own babies in oil barrels.  I feel horrible for the Iowa student that was murdered.  Now politicizing it?
1736 2018-08-22 21:03:41 Even @kevverage admits that #GERS is only an estimated starting position of independent Scotland. It would take some months after to ensure that the billions of £s worth of North Sea oil shipped directly from the source and currently not regarded as Scottish export is rectified
1737 2018-08-22 21:03:35 Used to warm olive oil up but more for earache. Must have also help clean cos it worked 
1738 2018-08-22 21:03:32 Garbage. Have been using it for years and am healthier than these so called experts. Same ones who promoted margarine no doubt. Probably also promotes canola oil. Whoever pays the piper gets the answer they want
1739 2018-08-22 21:03:29 Success!!! #6 spark plug is replaced. It had 3 weeks of soaking with penetrating oil and I took my time move the plug back and forth. Better idle, next job is the cap, rotor and wires!!!
And I did get dirty!!! Thanks!
1740 2018-08-22 21:03:28 Did tRump have anything to say about the White American citizen dude who killed his young daughters and pregnant, threw the kids in an oil drum and buried wife???  Evil is evil.
1741 2018-08-22 21:03:13 The rate at which fake news spreads in Nigeria is alarming. Please, carriers of fake news be careful.

1742 2018-08-22 21:03:09 $55/Master Kush Oil Carts while supplies last!
1743 2018-08-22 21:03:07 Do not forget Christopher Watts, who killed his pregnant wife & two young daughters in Colorado. He dumped his daughters bodies in an oil tank.
1744 2018-08-22 21:02:59 Does it have to be oil?  I think we have oregano LOL. 
1745 2018-08-22 21:02:58 Who the fuck eats that much coconut oil anyways?
1746 2018-08-22 21:02:43 Decrease stress, take biotin, use protein shampoo and oil your hair xxx
1747 2018-08-22 21:02:23 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
1748 2018-08-22 21:02:19 I fry in butter or coconut (and olive oil at lower temps). All the rest are eaten cold or coldish. With all the eggs ;) I'm queen of emulsifying with good tasting oils, lol.
1749 2018-08-22 21:02:14 I suspect those people were either using a very pungent oil or doing something wrong (like using way to much oil or getting the heat wrong so the oil never hardened)
1750 2018-08-22 21:02:13 I love the “go-to” Chicago ‘gotcha’ while all those little white boys are shooting up schools and the white men killing their wives and kids and shoving them in oil barrels and shooting an entire church full of people.
1751 2018-08-22 21:02:12 gonna start to write down my dreams when I take cbd oil. They are way out there 
1752 2018-08-22 21:02:10 Coconut oil isn’t good for your skin, hair, or body but y’all still finna cape for it
1753 2018-08-22 21:02:09 Hear hear! A bunch of east and south asian people have been poisoning themselves for generations. C'mon, probably more to do with the western way of making, consuming coconut oil or god knows what alternate oil lobby!
1754 2018-08-22 21:02:02 Also, we are almost identical biologically regardless of genes. That's why they can do studies on closely related animals and then can apply the results to humans. We don't vary so much that some people benefit from coconut oil and others do not. That would be biological chaos.
1755 2018-08-22 21:02:02 Otro tip que he escuchado es antes de lavarlo, detangle con coconut oil
1756 2018-08-22 21:02:00 Why doesn't anyone from Harvard (or anywhere) say how poisonous SUGAR really is???  As PLAINLY and VIVIDLY as the professor came out against coconut oil?
1757 2018-08-22 21:01:52 Pls I'll gladly want to take this test I'm waiting
1758 2018-08-22 21:01:43 It’s not if it’s in line with your eating habits. ALL of my blood work and health has been 100 times better than it EVER was since I began this journey. Sometimes I sub ghee with coconut oil if I don’t have any on hand.
1759 2018-08-22 21:01:39 Oil Money FC 2.0?
1760 2018-08-22 21:01:31 The string here is specifically about newly licensed oil extraction. Whataboutism is irrelevant. There is no winning moral argument for fossil fuels - it’s all about money and this is the angle you are approaching the issue from I am guessing by the Twitter name on your account
1761 2018-08-22 21:01:30 Do you use cbd oil for anything...#pain#relaxing
1762 2018-08-22 21:01:23 Venezuelan Oil is being purposely excluded from World markets by the US and Saudi
1763 2018-08-22 21:01:21 To be honest I’ve always been skeptical about the coconut oil obsession....
1764 2018-08-22 21:01:17 Can I just say that this college thing is very stressful already and I haven’t even moved in? I have to pay for all new tires, an oil change, I bought everything for college myself, and I have to pay for tuition and housing once I get there... I wanna cry
1765 2018-08-22 21:01:08 The best oil is olive oil. Proven track record.
1766 2018-08-22 21:00:52 Let's hear it for ladies day oil change special!
1767 2018-08-22 21:00:51 Kinda pissed b/c i’ve spent so much time and money on acne treatments and medications only to find that my skin looks better after one use of tea tree oil.....ok!
1768 2018-08-22 21:00:44 August 22, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1769 2018-08-22 21:00:43 Every 2 years Coconut oil goes from being “super good for your health” to “the worst thing for you” PICK ONE
1770 2018-08-22 21:00:40 I will continue to take organic coconut oil
1771 2018-08-22 21:00:32 Hows Ireland’s current and future GDP at the moment, they were once part of the British Isles and are of a similar size to Scotland WITHOUT oil. 

What’s going on there then?
1772 2018-08-22 21:00:29 There is lots of stress on engineers today to stay "relevant". Many think staying relevant is learning and trying all the new and shiny. Staying relevant to me is to be able to recognize significant problems in our field and the ability to set snake oil apart from solutions.

1775 2018-08-22 21:00:21 Anyone use olive oil for ear drops??

If so, how often do you use them and is it effective?
1776 2018-08-22 21:00:17 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1777 2018-08-22 21:00:15 "basing your economy on Oil revenue just doesn't stack up"

but basing it on the banking sector and city of London which litteraly brought the UK to it's knees in 2008 does.....aye ok David.
1778 2018-08-22 21:00:14 I have the same thing love except I also get chest tightness! It’s scary! CBD oil/cannabis helps me out a lot 
1779 2018-08-22 21:00:08 Soo should I not use coconut oil on my face ?
1780 2018-08-22 20:59:56 Yard cut.  Now to let the mower cool a bit and then change the oil
1781 2018-08-22 20:59:33 Put a few drops of oregano oil in glass of water - it’s a natural antibiotic
1782 2018-08-22 20:59:33 Don’t forget that the billions of £s of oil that gets extracted from the North Sea every year and shipped directly from the source doesn’t get counted as Scottish revenue #GERS #scotnight #indyref2 #bettertogether #BrexitShambles
1783 2018-08-22 20:59:30 ...none of those in Britain who talk about African dictatorship and kleptocracy seem aware that Idi Amin came to power in Uganda through British covert action, and that Nigeria's generals were supported and manipulated from 1960 onwards in support of Britain's oil interests."
1784 2018-08-22 20:59:28 Deniers will belive global warming is real when pinguins will catch fire on the ice sheet. And yes I start to think Mad Mad might be possible thanks to global warming and oil shartage.
1785 2018-08-22 20:59:24 Ready for Big Oil and Big Water?
1786 2018-08-22 20:59:20 is rhetorical question or what? 

what's going on is mass importation of "guest workers" (read: very nearly slavery) to work in the oil fields, and to do domestic service and construction work that the locals won't/can't do. most of the oil field and construction workers are men.
1787 2018-08-22 20:59:11 Yeah garlic is anti viral and antibacterial. I use garlic whenever I want to minimize a pimple, the next morning after using garlic I’ll wash my face like normal and use sweet almond oil with peppermint essential oils as a moisturizer.

1791 2018-08-22 20:59:01 Castor oil
1792 2018-08-22 20:58:59 So you're fine like this
1793 2018-08-22 20:58:55 And another factor was the collapse of oil prices.  Although they have since recovered, they were already too far down the hole and the mobsters magnify it by a factor of 10.
1794 2018-08-22 20:58:45 Howard,  we’ve been getting what we deserve for years and years. Will take a few more years as Republicans are more plentiful than oil down here!!!!
1795 2018-08-22 20:58:34 But they're obviously taking their cod liver oil tablets  they both have great mobility
1796 2018-08-22 20:58:28 All headlines for stories about murders should include the perpetrator's residence status.

E.g., "White man in country legally by birthright citizenship strangles family and leaves their bodies in oil barrels in the desert"
1797 2018-08-22 20:58:25 Do you think Stapleton knows it costs more to get a fishing license in Colorado than it does for a permit to drill an oil/gas well ($0).
1798 2018-08-22 20:58:12 You'll be pleased to know I couldn't use that Website so instead I have had to purchase a product made out of fairy farts and coconut oil. 
1799 2018-08-22 20:58:10 yes he's also sitting on a golf cart in the bowels of Lucas Oil Stadium right now
1800 2018-08-22 20:58:06 epic pizza. my face is awash with anchovy juice and chilli oil.

KISS ME YOU MANIAC
1801 2018-08-22 20:57:57 Tea tree oil also the ph level in the soap is high so it helps balance out the ph of your skin to help with acne

1803 2018-08-22 20:57:38 And who is going to tell him that Norway has so much money in reserve plus oil and gas in the ground that comparisons with Scotland are absolutely meaningless?
And their political classes are so much smarter and capable than Scotland’s!
1804 2018-08-22 20:57:37 What day is it ? Wednesday. Next Wednesday Coconut oil is good for you.
1805 2018-08-22 20:57:31 Now olive oil is bad for you?!?! I give up on trying to eat healthily.
1806 2018-08-22 20:57:27 If you literally mean coconuts, nobody will argue. But there is a difference between eating coconut and consuming coconut oil because you think it has beneficial properties.
1807 2018-08-22 20:57:27 That feeling when you burp and you taste your fish oil pill and multivitamin. It’s like I ate a whole wheat fish 
1808 2018-08-22 20:57:24 So I guess now even  oil is bad for you
1809 2018-08-22 20:57:13 Dont count out people in Srilanka and the Indian states of Kerala and Goa...did we all feed on poison. Likely not, its probably more to do with the western way of making, consuming coconut oil.
1810 2018-08-22 20:57:13 Y’all gon  quit talking about NICKI MINAJ y’all know I’ll go to jail for my bitch ,  cook some fries pour hot oil on A BITCH 
1811 2018-08-22 20:57:13 Lee Njiru on JKL.  He worked for  Mzee Jomo and Daniel Moi. I now understand the mindset of functionaries who oil the cog wheels of dictatorship: mystified by power, deify their bosses, see megalomania in mythical terms. Their memories lack critical reflection so are useseless
1812 2018-08-22 20:57:02 You are either referring to some story I'm not aware of (re: coconut oil) or you are having a very public break with reality. Either way, I support you.
1813 2018-08-22 20:56:59 Lol you must not know how much it cost for oil change or a broke part
1814 2018-08-22 20:56:49 Assuming ludicrously that an Independent Scotland would have the same financial burdens and priorities as Scotland in the union, and 26 of the 28 key GERS indicators are estimates, so bollocks! Take away HS2 & Trident and take back the whisky & oil flowing to WM treasury!
1815 2018-08-22 20:56:34 I went to secondary school over the road from John Browns and watched the last few oil rigs get built before the closed the yard. 

It's all unrecognisable now. Bulldozed flat and new stuff in the space.
1816 2018-08-22 20:56:34 You mean like the oil revenue was ring fenced for Westminster to piss against a wall?
1817 2018-08-22 20:56:01 大雨すごい
1818 2018-08-22 20:55:58 No that is not what I’m saying. If you are against man made effects of global warming - which you state as your rationale for opposition to oil and gas production - then you should feel equally as strongly about other man made effects such as livestock farming.
1819 2018-08-22 20:55:58 The funny thing is the commercial was so “gentrified”...like coconut oil is a new thing 
1820 2018-08-22 20:55:45 Remove makeup w/ coconut oil, double wash face (to get all makeup off) with cetaphil daily wash, witch hazel toner, charcoal clay mask 2x a week, scrub once a week, and moisturize w/ coconut oil mixed with a couple drops of tea tree oil + tea tree oil for spot treatment.
1821 2018-08-22 20:55:39 In my view this will be unhedged international companies. Maybe also Canadian well managed and unhedged companies - also in heavy oil. Also unhedged mining companies will benefit.
1822 2018-08-22 20:55:29 I was at a street stall in Glasgow, helping out. People told me repeatedly oil was running out. I told each one time after time about Clair ridge, most too blinkered in their views to listen.
1823 2018-08-22 20:55:03 Tea tree oil sis!
1824 2018-08-22 20:54:48 You should pierce your stomach and hook it up to a 22gal oil drum via a flexible hose. Increasing your capacity for kombucha
1825 2018-08-22 20:54:48 crib note: "While coconut oil has been advertised as a health food of sorts, nutrition experts say there is little evidence to back that claim."..."has shown more than 80 percent of the fat in coconut oil is saturated"
1826 2018-08-22 20:54:47 Benayed #NGDx18 40 uL of lysate saved in mineral oil, use QIAGEN kit for RNA from that. Shows list of fusions detected that are novel in lung.
1827 2018-08-22 20:54:33 Dont need to burn the oil, just dab it on a scarf or cushion. Hippie staple!
1828 2018-08-22 20:54:28 Coconut oil contains no fiber?!! Somebody give this person a Nobel prize. Guess what else doesn’t contain fiber? Water!
1829 2018-08-22 20:54:14 Any oil that solidifies in the hot isles of Walmart isn't good for you.
1830 2018-08-22 20:54:03 If my intake is too small for the oil to have measurable effect, then that phrase is plausible.

But I suspect that eejit didn't have that in mind ;)
1831 2018-08-22 20:53:57 And peanut oil too, although it has a taste
1832 2018-08-22 20:53:56 You dont make up the price or decide what people pay. We are not talking about bud because its THC content is not 100%. Cannabis oil that I consume is 80-97% tHC with some added terpenes to make it stronger. But there is bud out there worth 60$ a gram but you might not be a buyer
1833 2018-08-22 20:53:46 Oh so Obama is a crook, huh? And providing subsidies to renewable energy entities is theft? Are you also outraged about the exorbitant amount of subsidies and incentives that oil and fossil fuel companies get? Taxpayers heavily subsidize that industry.
1834 2018-08-22 20:53:36 Hope they showed up naked as every article of clothing on them is a derivative of oil.
1835 2018-08-22 20:53:36 Tonight's buffet menu: cream of tomato soup, grilled mozzarella cheese sandwich, red beans and rice, baked tilapia, garlic olive oil couscous, fresh buttered zucchini, coca cola cake
1836 2018-08-22 20:53:31 Neither gas nor oil nor nuclear power would have gotten to where they are now without decades of subsidies.
But wind & solar are fast becoming the cheapest electricity contracts.
And oil & gas still don't pay their pollution costs, but dump onto society at large. Called socialism
1837 2018-08-22 20:53:30 A person using a high-end oil-guzzling vehicle because oil is cheap is like a fat person overeating because food is cheap. Both must be given the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the Earth's resources. #GoGreen
1838 2018-08-22 20:53:24 He want him to romance the ram to death

1840 2018-08-22 20:53:01 Ambazombies: We must secede
Me: Why
Ambazombies: Cos we hv oil in Bakassi 
Me: Is that the new rule? 
Ambazombies: LRC has nth
Me: Really; who protected it from being taken away?
Ambazombies; All we  know is that we have oil in Bakassi
1841 2018-08-22 20:52:52 No be only Sarcasm na Saka Tinubu,you can't ridicule a peoples religious rite and call it sarcasm, don't even go near that shit.
1842 2018-08-22 20:52:40 A little coconut oil in the nose will help it run and ease breathing. So sorry
1843 2018-08-22 20:52:35 Coconut oil makes my hair brittle for some reason. When I tried putting it on my face it made me break out. We just use it solely for cooking now.
1844 2018-08-22 20:52:30 I don't know... Might approach the US listing cautious... The plan was to get listed on the London stock Exchange and New York stock exchange simutaneaously but now with growing and steady oil prices they might just not want to dilute ownership for the time being
1845 2018-08-22 20:52:28 The only thing Corpina got wright was status quo, had Hillary been elected there would not have been a squeak about Russia , and for sure no economic recovery, and Iran would have been running the Middle East by now, controlling the price of oil, to our detriment!
1846 2018-08-22 20:52:21 Gov took over food production and removed the incentive to keep on producing. When that happened gov used their oil revenues to import food. Somebody didn’t do their times table at school.
1847 2018-08-22 20:52:10 I eat coconut oil ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, have been doing it for several years now.
1848 2018-08-22 20:52:04 CASTOR  OIL 
1849 2018-08-22 20:52:01 i was suppose go get my oil changed like 3,000 miles ago and i finally did it today ....
1850 2018-08-22 20:51:51 Why are they all trying to soothe Natalie? She's nominated. She knew the game. Take your oil #CBB
1851 2018-08-22 20:51:46 Today’s entertainment: Watching health cults lose their minds on social media because a Harvard Professor claims that coconut oil is unhealthy / poison.
1852 2018-08-22 20:51:27 Nigga out here really stealing oil caps from Honda accord motors... nigga fuck you, I find out who did it, free head bust
1853 2018-08-22 20:51:27 I guess I’ll just have to die from coconut oil poisoning because I live on all things coconut 
1854 2018-08-22 20:51:26 I agree whole grain foods blow me up like a balloon I'll stick with the coconut oil I don't trust these big fancy professors
1855 2018-08-22 20:51:15 Lol. South Indian peoples are up in arms. 
"Too many vested interests. The problem is our own researchers do not do enough research on traditional practices. Listen to Dr. BM Hegde's talk. Coconut oil is as good as mother's  milk."


1856 2018-08-22 20:51:09 I did some off screen work in the TLF map to eliminate some boring grindy stuff. Join me in 2 hrs and I'll walk you through some of the changes and we'll continue to work on problem resolution in our oil production. I'll see you all tonight on @factoriogame for @ExtraLife4Kids
1857 2018-08-22 20:51:09 Yeah, I was really surprised when the cardiologist and the the cardio nutritionist when I mentioned coconut oil were like yeah...don't go adding that to a lot of things. It's not as great as you think. So olive oil it is.
1858 2018-08-22 20:51:08 Oil pulling used for over a century using coconut oil. Nothing but healthy benefits.
1859 2018-08-22 20:51:07 well my ancestors have been consuming coconut oil for years and they turned out ok and live a long healthy lives while in America we think drinking soda is ok as long as in moderation.
1860 2018-08-22 20:51:07 U.S. crude oil imports from Nigeria in July plunged to the lowest level in 3 yrs and are continuing to slip as Asian and European buyers increase purchases, trade flow data from Thomson Reuters and market intelligence firms Genscape and Kpler show.
1861 2018-08-22 20:51:06 What we learn today is that UK charge-back is disproportionate, that oil revenue of £37bn is missing, that the figures are utter rubbish. And that you are a liar
1862 2018-08-22 20:51:06 Such crap!  I’ve taken coconut oil for years and blood work is better than it ever has been. It is awesome for dental heath and as a moisturizer. 

Liars hate when we find a way to naturally find wellness. Money grubbing creeps.
1863 2018-08-22 20:50:46 The pipeline proposed route wasn't even going to go through Montreal, only a connector was to be built if Montreal approved. Besides, yes it was a way to export oil. Which I'm not against. However, those municipalities, landowners and farmers who opposed the project had the right
1864 2018-08-22 20:50:45 Hey big oil, you shitting us right ? The number one contributors to global warming and you want taxpayers to help build a sea wall. Hell most big oil and the state of Texas doesn't believe in global warming. How much did big oil companies profit last year ?
1865 2018-08-22 20:50:33 Topping ideas 
- tomatoes and lardo on toast with basil oil.
- avacado and smoked salmon on toast.
- Strawberries, cheese , avocado and honey.
- hard boiled eggs and herb toast.
- kale, feta and fried egg toast.

1867 2018-08-22 20:50:29 Chilli oil on my fave ivy park leggings if u need me I be cryin in the corner reminiscing of better times
1868 2018-08-22 20:50:22 Beef tallow?  Duck fat is where it's at!  Although, admittedly, beef tallow beats vegetable oil EVERY time for fries.
1869 2018-08-22 20:50:21 Coconut oil has been receiving attention today in the media following a professor from harvard referring to it as 'poison'... Coconut oil is absolutely fine to have in moderation and not harmful to your health when consumed as part of a healthy balanced diet.
1870 2018-08-22 20:50:05 someone: you’ve got such nice skin!

my annoying ass: i actually have a dry skin type, I use diluted tea tree oil for pimples and -
1871 2018-08-22 20:50:04 It does well with oil (particularly if you agitate it with a brush) but it won't shift grease.
1872 2018-08-22 20:50:03 Ive heard that CBD Oil can help to reduce insomnia
1873 2018-08-22 20:49:50 Hmm, how much did the oil industry give to the treasury over the past 40 odd years, £300bn or so?
1874 2018-08-22 20:49:30 It takes a bit of getting used to, avoid painted lines, bus stops and anything that looks like oil! To be fair the majority of drivers round here arnt too bad, eye contact is always good ... stuff you will probably do naturally
1875 2018-08-22 20:49:29 I think it would keep OK! We always eat it the night we make it, you might want to make the finishing oil fresh
1876 2018-08-22 20:49:18 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
1877 2018-08-22 20:49:16 A Harvard professor thinks so... its high in saturated fats... i dunno..m if your vegan or not eating any animal fat like me how bad could fatty fat coconut oil really be?? I think its probably beneficial for a plant based diet because you need some fat
1878 2018-08-22 20:49:15 I’m getting my oil changed and I tbh I did not know Dr. Phil was still on TV making new episodes until about 5 min ago when I sat down in the lobby
1879 2018-08-22 20:49:10 Tariffs to prop up well-connected industries and far  bailouts aren't so conservative Purp.  And selling strategic reserve oil to artificially lower oil prices is downright Venezuelan socialist.
1880 2018-08-22 20:48:58 – apply olive oil and sugar
– soak your hands in egg yolks
– make a hand cream of butter and almond oil
– wear gloves in cold weather
– drInk PleNtY oF wAtEr!!1!1 
– don’t use too much lotion
1881 2018-08-22 20:48:24 Things that make your hair grow quicker:

- Wild growth oil
- Monistat 7
- Vicks vaporub
- Biotin 5000 mcg
- Healthy lifestyle
1882 2018-08-22 20:48:23 Unless it takes longer than a day to process and burn those 250 Cal's of coconut oil, in which case it would keep stacking and restrict resources that would be used to process other foods. It's more complicated than basic arithmetic can model.
1883 2018-08-22 20:48:11 hauled 10, YES TEN, bottles of wine home from Paris today  plus bread, pasta, chocolate, cheese, popcorn and pizza oil.
1884 2018-08-22 20:48:07 People did listen. At least amongst my FB friends. Cameron visited the site 'secretly' but it was all over social media. Yet we were called tin-foil hat conspiracy theorists by hacks like David Leask at the Herald. Last few years almost 40% of new oil discoveries were Scottish 
1885 2018-08-22 20:48:03 I gave my mom who was  in a locked Alzheimer's unit in the nursing home  Coconut oil  every other day.  By the end of six weeks of fighting for her to get her out because my mom was back (brain) and that kept her home for a great 2 1/2 yrs.  I use it daily.  Great stuff!
1886 2018-08-22 20:47:56 the world is moving away from using oil Eh BS
1887 2018-08-22 20:47:55 So I know I'm no oil painting but when you get a comment on Instagram after posting a picture..  insulting the way you look it kinda crushes how you feel 
1888 2018-08-22 20:47:53 its considered good 4 ur mental health to occasionally oil yourself up and slide around the floor like a sea slug
1889 2018-08-22 20:47:53 I don’t get it what’s so bad about putting coconut oil on your face?
1890 2018-08-22 20:47:51 I know coconut oil is getting bad press right as I type this tweet but just made some brownies with said oil and they are *chef’s kiss*
1891 2018-08-22 20:47:42 I need a oil change
1892 2018-08-22 20:47:42 We have a daddy sugar minister in Norway, in Oil! @frp_no young girls on daddy (or daddys knee?
1893 2018-08-22 20:47:36 I love energy, especially oil.
1894 2018-08-22 20:47:35 No high value goods going to London to be sold on Scotland's behalf for a start. No companies profits being tax at their UKs in England, leaving Scotland with just the costs. No wasting billions on Trident. Taxing oil extraction at the same rate as Norway instead of at 0%. etc.
1895 2018-08-22 20:47:20 This pig dates from the age of lard,  long before the age ok “cooking oil”
1896 2018-08-22 20:47:20 Only fools & people with agendas use Venezuela as an example of “failed socialism”. The US & Canada are waging economic warfare against them, for the crime of nationalizing oil production
1897 2018-08-22 20:47:11 How does every other Country in the World without Oil or Whisky ever survive? 

What does England have to sell?

Strip out London and SE, where financials are spilling out in droves because of Brexit currently, and what exactly does England have to sell? 
1898 2018-08-22 20:47:09 Paul is a pawn of Putin and the NRA and Big Oil. His support of Kavanaugh is tainted with GOP self interests. Kavanaugh is outside of  mainstream American ideals.
1899 2018-08-22 20:47:06 Guy at Toyota asked me if I was ok and If I was high on anything lol, nah man I just want my oil changed
1900 2018-08-22 20:47:03 Remember when John McCain blamed Obama for the Pulse Shooting 
1901 2018-08-22 20:47:01 All this talk about fatty foods and now #coconut oil is pure nonsense; my Dad who was a doctor once told me "everything in moderation Robyn", do your own thinking & investigating, and enjoy life" ... nothing could be further from the truth 
1902 2018-08-22 20:47:00 I love it too but I think it should be one of the oils you use not the only oil, and in moderation.
1903 2018-08-22 20:46:53 Good job whoever paid off Harvard to halt the gentrification of coconut oil so that it never becomes too pricey for us to put on our knees elbows and split ends like the tropics intended.
1904 2018-08-22 20:46:53 Natural Green Color No oil Treatment and no heated Swat Emerald lot available in very Good Price Any one interested please send me PM
1905 2018-08-22 20:46:51 "Lookin' fine, bro! Check it out, we both got scarves! Now that's stylin'!" (Oil Man, MM Powered Up)
1906 2018-08-22 20:46:51 Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that coconut oil is health food and I don't suggest eating tubs of it, but it is not unhealthy.
1907 2018-08-22 20:46:31 Yup, exactly how Dad ruled 
East vs West,  
English vs French,  
Ontario vs Quebec
Oil vs Industrial 
Anything he could find to divide Canadians
1908 2018-08-22 20:46:29 ARGAN OIL FOREVER
1909 2018-08-22 20:46:28 Mad init how the Aussies and that are saying it’s freezing at 10 degrees, we’ve already got the barby fired up and are half caked in carrot oil at them sort of temps man
1910 2018-08-22 20:46:04 So if we are only £13 billion down and oil revenues are £32 billion then we would could have massive surpluses.
1911 2018-08-22 20:46:03 Stop in and try our Lemon Pepper Olive Oil! It's the perfect blend of tart and spice that will make a great addition to any chicken dish. #yeglocal
1912 2018-08-22 20:46:02 Thanks. I get about one out of 100.
1913 2018-08-22 20:45:58 Let’s not forget the White American citizen that just killed and dumped his beloved pregnant wife and daughters into America’s Holy Grail - the oil pit.
1914 2018-08-22 20:45:55 Oh thank goodness... I love coconut but really don't care for anything cooked in coconut oil. 
1915 2018-08-22 20:45:49 Thank you. Simple tastes. I love and use extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar of Modena. :)
1916 2018-08-22 20:45:49 I've seen this story on every platform today. I accept the science of it, but I disagree with her interpretation of the science. Also, LOVE coconut oil.
1917 2018-08-22 20:45:48 @DrGundry Is Palmolein same as palm oil and red palm oil?
1918 2018-08-22 20:45:46 My granny used it a lot. I use it a lot. I’m healthy no heart problems, no diabetes no rheumatoid problems, no gastric problems. Use it on rashes, to heal small cuts and sometimes as wash mouth. Dishes with coconut oil or with coconut pulp are delicious
1919 2018-08-22 20:45:44 My car has had an oil change, a full tank of gas, cleaned inside and outside, and air put in the tires the past two days. Needless to say, I’m broke
1920 2018-08-22 20:45:41 No ex-soviet stone deserved to exist in ex-soviet slave nations. I would destroy every damn soviet building, statues, fences, roads, everything what reminds me of them and let Poland renew its image.... too bad I don’t own any oil fields...
1921 2018-08-22 20:45:36 My favourite part of this is a "Harvard professor" is making an arbitrary claim that coconut oil is bad because of saturated fat. When if you search "is saturated fat bad" on google the first thing that pops up is a Harvard article on why its not
1922 2018-08-22 20:45:23 Yeah. Someone tell them computers don't contain oil.
1923 2018-08-22 20:45:13 @RickShielsPGA hay Rick.... I know this is out of the blue ..can u make a vid about gloves and what not to wash ur hands with before a round like no dippy things like oil and Vaseline and keep the hands clean alternate solutions
1924 2018-08-22 20:44:57 The 'Israel lobby' is actually run by the White House. And the White House us in turn run by the US arms & oil companies.
1925 2018-08-22 20:44:47 Obama's 8 year average was 1.5%.. pathetic.  He was carried by big oil, directional drilling investments and fracking which he campaigned against... Obama wasn't good at anything.
1926 2018-08-22 20:44:45 I've been watching your YouTube channel for the last 3 hours! I think I was first to see the new girl/girl oil show video you posted  I could listen to you speak all day Katie you have the cutest voice and that little giggle . . . 
1927 2018-08-22 20:44:43 Coconut oil gets mad bad press, olive oil never gets this.
1928 2018-08-22 20:44:32 Just tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, basal a3 out of four from my garden
1929 2018-08-22 20:44:27 Yes. It's called forward planning. If we treated oil as an actual bonus and didn't require it just to stay solvent then awesome but the entire plan is around a resource which is diminishing and value is very variable.
How about you out something in to make your case none insane
1930 2018-08-22 20:44:25 I wish I could find the old stella I did years ago when I was little. on a canvas. with oil painting
1931 2018-08-22 20:44:22 "The whitest and whitest things in the world cannot be ingested or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1932 2018-08-22 20:44:17 It is also good for your teeth. You swish the coconut oil in your mouth for 10-15 minutes. It detoxifies, it removes the harmful bacteria from your mouth.
1933 2018-08-22 20:44:13 You folks paying attention?  Oil supremacy.  Missile Defense.  Javelins.  And ask the Wagner Brigade about the effects of Trump policy.
1934 2018-08-22 20:44:03 i did everything i said i was gonna do today (except get an oil change)... & i’m proud of myself bc it was so easy to be lazy... it was hard to get this shit done in spite of my tired/laziness

Devin Nunes campaign donations:

2015-2016.   $2,304,072.84
2017-2018.   $7,323,773.43

Large donations came in from Akin Gump, a law firm for oil exploration company. Exploring in Azerbaijan.

Putin sent Manafort to Azerbaijan before his arrest.

Nune's went to Azerbaijan
1936 2018-08-22 20:43:53 Coconut oil has literally saved me from a ton of things. Ezcema. Cuts. Countless things! Love it!
1937 2018-08-22 20:43:15 Freezing chillies is a perfect way to store them without spoiling them. I'd put them into a chilli, or if they are Jalapeno bake them with olive oil and sea salt :)
1938 2018-08-22 20:43:02 You need the Declaration of Independence and constitution to preserve your freedom an understanding of it. Madison’s music.
1939 2018-08-22 20:42:59 From my new Book, OIL and GOD
Obama’s ME deeds:
-Empowered Iran   
-Entangled Shi’ite/Sunni in wars far away from the US
-Drove Riyadh to buy $112 billion in arms + $110 billion, which Trump signed
-Drove Riyadh to seek Israel friendship
-Opened Iran’s market to US business
1940 2018-08-22 20:42:54 Expect more of it. 
Actually Venezuela was looking pretty good, until oil prices tanked. 
But we're not talking reasonable discourse here. It's reflexive propaganda.
1941 2018-08-22 20:42:41 He had the great opportunity to reboot the country when he was sworn in.
He could have taken tough decisions to change the narrative for the country. 
No one would have complained on rightsizing at all levels, oil subsidy removal , new fx regime...alas PMB wasnt prepared to serve

1946 2018-08-22 20:42:26 Antitrust doesn't only apply to utilities. Hell, the case that used to be foundational was named for a snake oil salesman.

1950 2018-08-22 20:42:10 Oil? What you talking about? 
1951 2018-08-22 20:42:09 This world has been here longer than we have. No way have we unlocked secrets the earth may hold. Like THEY say oil comes from dinosaurs. BS. I just don't buy it. Money, greed, and power is what its about. THEY will lie to the end to keep the global warming narrative going.
1952 2018-08-22 20:42:03 @local_pineapple we adulted so hard today. I went to the bank. And then we got Sarah’s oil changed and then vacuumed her car out. Ready to go home and drink some wine and clean the apartment

#Proverbs21_20
1955 2018-08-22 20:41:48 I will die out of natural causes n not by coconut oil you idiot Professor.. whoever you are.. Grrrrr
1956 2018-08-22 20:41:38 Venezuela: a potentially wealthy society destroyed by destructive,outdated macroeconomic policy populism and American sanctions, interference and miscalculated belief in permanently high oil prices. Is that better explained?
1957 2018-08-22 20:41:35 The oil in my oil tank gelled up and we didnt have heat or hot water from Christmas eve till new years day, but yeah being a little hot is worse..

It would be interesting to find out if he profits from shrinking National Parks. Oil, gas, grazing rights, infrastructure?
1966 2018-08-22 20:40:49 Coconut oil is hear for your skin, even if the jury is out on its internal benefits.

1968 2018-08-22 20:40:44 i used to eat coconut oil when i was little
1969 2018-08-22 20:40:41 Coconut oil is not & has never been a healthy fat. Stop fucking using it to cook. Rub it on your ass or head. Bye.
1970 2018-08-22 20:40:40 Love to oil pull while I read all about how bad coconut oil is for you
1971 2018-08-22 20:40:34 2 words...... Bio Oil.....

1973 2018-08-22 20:40:30 All I wanted was to oil change and go home....
1974 2018-08-22 20:40:28 So a man killed his pregnant wife and two kids and stuffed their bodies in an oil tanker. Will immigration reform stop crazy white American men from killing too?
1975 2018-08-22 20:40:27 I mean... it’s oil. Don’t eat oil straight. It’s 100% fat. Do people just like... gobble down oils?
1976 2018-08-22 20:40:25 Isn't Rosneft mixed up in Venezuela now?

Isn't Putin directly connected to the Venezuelan oil industry?
1977 2018-08-22 20:40:12 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
1978 2018-08-22 20:40:09 My best guess is that there was a huge surplus of it so they endorsed it as a superfood to shift it all and also I agree the taste is horrendous  OLIVE OIL 4EVA
1979 2018-08-22 20:40:02 We definitely don't eat a ton of it, but it's the oil I use for the most part now because I really like the taste of it with eggs, or sautéing, etc.
1980 2018-08-22 20:39:57 mmm gotta get an oil change and all of the sudden my family puts more chores for me to do outside
1981 2018-08-22 20:39:55 Pam spray or olive oil works! We had a little bird get trapped... And kids were glad to see it fly and be free! Good bye tray traps!
1982 2018-08-22 20:39:53 Please, people in the Caribbean have been using coconut oil sins slavery

1988 2018-08-22 20:39:08 *breaks put massage oil* lol
1989 2018-08-22 20:39:01 Lmao I’m from PR I never heard of eating coconut oil and we even eat the husk
1990 2018-08-22 20:38:58 Isn’t palm oil hugely destructive for rainforests and responsible for the imminent extinction of orangutans though
1991 2018-08-22 20:38:55 Almond oil comes from almonds and people tend not to eat that!
1992 2018-08-22 20:38:45 From my new Book, OIL and GOD:
Obama pursued 4 policies that empowered Iran & ruined Iraq & Syria:
- Midwifed the JCPOA.
- Supported Iran's proxy in Iraq, PM Nouri al-Maliki (2006-2014).
- Pulled US troops from Iraq too early.
- Handed Syria to Iran.
1993 2018-08-22 20:38:24 No surprise..i am already ordering CBD oil on line...not the hemp junk, the real deal...and there is lots of other product there too...
1994 2018-08-22 20:38:23 Russia on 9th place because we don’t really give a fuck about work, just watching oil pumping to china 
1995 2018-08-22 20:38:22 Let me roll a blunt for this oil change and tune up
1996 2018-08-22 20:38:20 what’s the name of this Havard Professor? I’d like to chat directly to him.. Someone get his contact for me..Enough is enough.. Prople stop believing this rubbish.. I’ve been consuming COLD PRESS COCONUT OIL for the past 4 yrs due to...
1997 2018-08-22 20:38:16 "The customary royalty percentage is 12.5 percent or 1/8 of the value of the oil or gas at the wellhead. However, owners who have highly desirable properties and highly developed negotiating skills can sometimes get 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent or more. "
1998 2018-08-22 20:38:14 You say this while daily benefiting from oil production in every facet of your life.
 Strip yourself of everything related to oil you'll find yourself standing in a forest naked.

 But you won't do that you will just continue to be a hypocrite
1999 2018-08-22 20:38:11 AND a bottle containing oil labelled Back To Sender.
2000 2018-08-22 20:38:07  that's not EXACTLY what they are saying. It's an estimate and based on many factors that change. A 4 year old would have grasped that by now.

So Scotland leaves UK and all the Falklands drill sites around Antarctica?
Again, plan without oil?

2003 2018-08-22 20:37:44 This string is disturbing that these pos actually are excusing this animal. The difference is if he wasn’t here, this wouldn’t have happened. Wtf is wrong with these people?
2004 2018-08-22 20:37:37 I’d take coconut oil over canola any day.
2005 2018-08-22 20:37:31 @jiffylube fire this man! He called me a nigger because I told him I just wanted an oil change!!!
2006 2018-08-22 20:37:27 How many times do I need to tell you that I'm sorry I tried to do the tablecloth trick at your birthday party? How was I supposed to know that oil candle was real and that your aunt's weave was so flammable?
2007 2018-08-22 20:37:23 Sure you could BUT you have another or two qb’s to back him up if that happens . How many cars or drivers can back up a guy in nascar after the race started because an oil line busted ? Not even an in house made part .
2008 2018-08-22 20:37:22 Who is fake and who isn’t.,the repeal of the smith-mundt act 2012 legalized state propaganda (mind control).
2009 2018-08-22 20:37:12  I only cook shrimp with it. I prefer olive or avocado oil in all honesty.
2010 2018-08-22 20:37:09 My friend is lactose intolerant she is in her late 40s and is of average weight she had high cholesterol.  She replaced dairy with coconut oil and milk and her cholesterol is down 20 points she says she has made no other changes. I have no idea if it is related.
2011 2018-08-22 20:37:07 Burnt my whole arm with hot oil .. this shit hurts so bad
2012 2018-08-22 20:37:02 I use it, when I make a curry. You have to be careful about opinions, even from what looks like a reputable source. So far, Coconut, Olive, Sunflower, Grapeseed, Peanut, ...... are all types of oil that have been accused as being bad. 
2013 2018-08-22 20:37:00 I can’t wait for writers to start using coconut oil as a poison instead of the overplayed arsenic or cyanide.
2014 2018-08-22 20:36:59 For once håller inte med dig. Carl Bildt är arrogant och har fel i det mesta han säger. Troligen också Bilderberg gruppens guldgosse. Så rekommenderar starkt att inte framhålla honom i några sammanhang förutom om du funderar på att investera i det etiska Lundin Oil.
2015 2018-08-22 20:36:52 Yet you continue the products derived from oil isn't that rather hypocritical
2016 2018-08-22 20:36:52 Obama is a shapeshifting reptile and a reptile cannot be an American citizen!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2017 2018-08-22 20:36:46 this is a surprise to y’all? it’s literally an oil lmao
2018 2018-08-22 20:36:35 @TeamCavuto Give the economy to Trump. If Obama had completed the oil pipeline and not shoved double priced health care down America's throat and extra regulations, I would give @Barackbamaa the credit. Obama still could win if he supported Trump and stopped the witch hunt.
2019 2018-08-22 20:36:34 It is called socialism!  That is worse for this country than anything Trump has done!  It has not worked anywhere. Social security sucks you can barely scrape by on the crumbs from the table.  You are a Snake Oil  Salesman!
2020 2018-08-22 20:36:31 Do this for small structural models of oilfields and you could sell them to companies for celebratory gifts. Way better than drops of fake oil in acrylic.
2021 2018-08-22 20:36:21 The professor bashing coconut oil looked like a shriveled up skinwalker. Her skin was horrible. If anything she needs to add more fats to her diet.

2024 2018-08-22 20:36:15 The implication of you saying it was a way for Alberta to export oil, says it all. I believe that energy east called for using most of an existing NG pipeline. Coderre made it his pet project to have it denied. 2 words, Lac Magantique. The oil still flows, but it’s on rail.
2025 2018-08-22 20:36:14 Try palm oil or engine oil

2028 2018-08-22 20:36:03 Coconut oil: The facts behind 'pure poison' - Aha, the conspiracy is back...remember it was the 80s when these claims were first made.  Them we found out that it was done on behalf of the palm, sunflower and olive oil industries.  All these theories have been debunked.

2060 2018-08-22 20:33:15 Yes, as the scans don't give entirely picture due to depth, interference, minerals in sea bed. I mean, that's basic. If they knew exactly where and how much oil was in a place they'd go only there first. Get it?
2061 2018-08-22 20:32:59 It’s good to see that the Americans have caught up to the fact that coconut oil is a fat and not one of your five a day.

2062 2018-08-22 20:32:43 @JWH1895 @sheilaaj @aawsat_News just as Iranian oil exports started declining, what a coincidence!
2063 2018-08-22 20:32:40 Italian is easy-olive oil and garlic on the garlic bread,marinara sauce on the pasta-if you chop up and add in high quality meatless sausage and act like a martyr,they will probably think it is real.

2067 2018-08-22 20:32:19 Don't forget the $1.7 billion was in untraceable cash.

2069 2018-08-22 20:32:17 If coconut oil is poison, are the people who have been consuming coconut oil for centuries now, the living dead?! 
Heck... Am I actually dead n don't know it yet?!!

2078 2018-08-22 20:31:49 Public preschool and kindergarten require  working families to pay tuition while oil and gas producers in the state keep their tax exemptions, which are among the most generous in the country
2079 2018-08-22 20:31:49 I think that’s only if heated, no? Like I always knew you should never heat coconut oil
2080 2018-08-22 20:31:46 Oil is dying and you are lying and your posts are getting old and boring
2081 2018-08-22 20:31:44 It is the responsibility of African oil rich countries to not contract oil mining companies that are keen to making money thus without any development agenda for oil vulnerable environments.
2082 2018-08-22 20:31:38 You do know they scan the seabed first before drilling. I used to date an oil geologist, they just don’t start drilling in any old place. 
2083 2018-08-22 20:31:24 You’ll also need 5+15wt oil & heat proof grease but barring any nasty surprises that’s all you need by the look of it.
2084 2018-08-22 20:31:10 Justin still destroying relations with Saudi Arabia and the middle East where Canada buys foreign oil!  Justin costing Canada billions of dollars!
2085 2018-08-22 20:30:55 I made oil capsules for my wife because she can't do the flavor of abv. I kind of like it. It's a little bit nutty.
2086 2018-08-22 20:30:47 I guess “coconut oil” is a pressing issue for some people.
2087 2018-08-22 20:30:44 What so, are you suggesting that there is only one set way to cook each of the millions of dishes that are available? Even something as simple as scrambled egg can be cooked in different ways! "Oh my GOD! He's used butter AND olive oil! Burn him at the stake!"
It's rediculous.
2088 2018-08-22 20:30:43 Don't forget adding a good amount of canola oil to your kale smoothie. It easily covers the bad taste of the soy oil you should be adding as well.

If you can't get that, use #WD40
2089 2018-08-22 20:30:38 Always frustrating to hear @DanaRohrabacher blather-on abt "protecting Americans/America".

2095 2018-08-22 20:30:13 There's lots of hype about coconut oil. Here are the facts? And, as far as using it to remove makeup or moisturize- it causes acne in those who are at risk
2096 2018-08-22 20:30:03 Blair Kingyou can't call yourself an "environmentalist" from this point on your an oil company hack!
Every one of your arguments starts with the premise that oil is here get used to it it's never going away.
You're a give me the sad flawed and you are arrogant.
2097 2018-08-22 20:30:03 Coconut oil is good for health, but that doesn't mean u eat tons of it.
a Harvard professor terming coconut oil "pure poison" can mean:
1)He doesn't know what poison is
2)He wants to promote the refined oil industry 
3)The coconut oil he is talking about isn't authentic
2098 2018-08-22 20:30:01 i wanna know who was out here thinking eating coconut oil by the spoonful is good for u
2099 2018-08-22 20:30:00 As for history, if you don't have all the issues of being a post-industrial, post-imperial country to deal with, and you discover oil, you go from being essentially a rural economy to a wealthy rural economy. The UK and Scotland don't have that privilege.
2100 2018-08-22 20:29:51 Yes where I come from my grandma would be dead given the coconut and coconut oil she ate. Heck she is a lovely 87 yr old who still puts coconut oil in her hair and cooks with coconut oil. Just don’t hog like a pig. Eat how much your body really needs and exercise.
2101 2018-08-22 20:29:48 return my country kashmir what it was in old time according to survey here is lot oil in leh ladakh ....
2102 2018-08-22 20:29:35 I wonder the same about avocado oil and almond milk.
2103 2018-08-22 20:29:22 Ah makes sense now. We had to use baby oil. Too late, I’m hiding in the cupboard. Halfway through the second bottle of QC. Hic 
2104 2018-08-22 20:29:19 Do you support palm oil being used and subsidised for biofuels?

She’s excited but I’m annoyed bc she’s slippery and won’t keep still.

2110 2018-08-22 20:28:54 My half Italian kids were saying that fresh pomegranate juice was the summer fashion fad in Rome this year! How backward :) We need to copyright all our stuff: ghoghosee, lavashak, abeh ghooreh! Who needs oil when u have these?!!
2111 2018-08-22 20:28:44 @ogfeet I wanna say that, I like your feet. They very attractive as well as you in every way. Even when covered in blue glitter, closer look at your pretty toes and caressing in body oil. The best imaginable, is laying at your feet. 
2112 2018-08-22 20:28:43 idk who this message is for but God told me to tell you BRUSH YO DAMN TEETH ITS TEW HOT OUTSIDE TO BE DEALING WITH PPL BREATH SMELLING LIKE THEY NEED A OIL CHANGE
2113 2018-08-22 20:28:40 And the 37 bn of oil miraculously does not count. Scotland’s resources good news for Engerland as if we really cost you 13bn get rid of us and improve basket case UK economy.
Thought not.
2114 2018-08-22 20:28:18 *checks the oil levels of his hair*

Okay, but I don’t pand.
2115 2018-08-22 20:28:13 Oh yes, I put a little tea tree oil and then coconut oil on top. It’s faded so many acne scars.
2116 2018-08-22 20:28:10 Well, duh, this was known decades ago, similar to palm oil. I was actually surprised when suddenly I see it mentioned all over as a superfood. Reason I had stopped following these changing info like a seesaw. Remember apples? Butter? Eggs? Whole milk? Rice cakes?
2117 2018-08-22 20:28:02 I am about to mute the words coconut oil. I am so close, I swear I’m going to do it.
2118 2018-08-22 20:27:52 Damn bro! You stay clownin’! Hahaa as a matter of fact, yes, I’m going to water my plants! but I also have other adult like things to do like get an oil change 
2119 2018-08-22 20:27:46 A licence doesn't mean oil is guaranteed nor quantity. Because they *think* there is oil there. Quantity, quality etc are all unknown.

Now, what is Scotland's future? A finite resource which isn't paying now isn't the answer
2120 2018-08-22 20:27:29 Idk. Ion cook with it cause I don’t like the taste, but u can use is as any oil substitute
2121 2018-08-22 20:27:25 yes dude I wake up and there be maaaad oil there 
2122 2018-08-22 20:27:23 Not necessarily true

 because coal carbon stripping facilities will be injecting CO to in the ground in the future to force oil and gas out

Another scare tactic article

Gives you only a little tiny tip of information
2123 2018-08-22 20:27:22 alas if there's one thing the ameirican education system taught you and i, it's how to procrastinate, this is why i still believe that we can learn a new and improved system of living, we can usurp the oil monopolies, we can america great like never before, maybe Jesus will help?
2124 2018-08-22 20:27:19 Gee, that oil just comes from the delivery truck. Why take the risk of drilling oil wells?
2125 2018-08-22 20:27:03 I’ve used it to oil pull but to eat, no. On my hair, I’m good. It isn’t a bad oil but it isn’t one of the best.
2126 2018-08-22 20:27:00 How is oil to blame for the forest fires? Please provide the science.
2127 2018-08-22 20:26:44 Its a lovely place with no mud skippers that is for sure.
2128 2018-08-22 20:26:36 Coconut oil is fast, pretty much all fat. It's bad if you drink it like water but replacing actual poisons like"vegetable" or canola oil, it's far healthier.
2129 2018-08-22 20:26:28 I guess they will be shifting from monetizing it via IPO to monetizing it via oil sales now
2130 2018-08-22 20:26:25 It's a well known fact, that Amazon rainforest natives have been using coconut oil tipped blowpipes for years, such is its toxicity...
2131 2018-08-22 20:26:24 coconut oil is truly the devil.
2132 2018-08-22 20:26:23 Do red oil
2133 2018-08-22 20:26:11 Grown Rogue 1/2g Oil Cartridges are going for only $25 each!!! Price is BEFORE TAX!!! Come get yours today!!!
2134 2018-08-22 20:26:04 Scotlands people own Scotland for the length of time we are on the planet. Why do we pay for our own resources.  Why do we pay for oil and gas to run our houses and cars.  Sure pay for the technology but we should be getting our cut on this.
2135 2018-08-22 20:26:03 Thanks it is really good. Hummus, kale, red kidney beans, fresh Turkey burgers that I made just made them long rather then round. 90 cal flat bread. Cucumber and tomato tossed in seasoning olive oil and balsamic. Watermelon.
2136 2018-08-22 20:25:55 Ok this is purely cooking with coconut oil. I don't really cook with it so meh. I stick with olive oil and Irish butter if I have to use oil to cook
2137 2018-08-22 20:25:54 so the oil in Texas, Saudi etc is still British then
2138 2018-08-22 20:25:49 yeah, MUCH better! batter and hot oil and some really yummy sides!!
2139 2018-08-22 20:25:41 Hmm, this is the second thing I've seen today about the "dangers" of coconut oil.  Not sure I buy it.  Wonder who funded the research?
2140 2018-08-22 20:25:37 I hate when I smoke and go somewhere in public and then people start being weird and shit. I came to get an oil change and some lady is talking to herself. It makes me wonder if I’m just high or are people fucking weird?
2141 2018-08-22 20:25:36 You claim to be about orangutans. Palm oil is the biggest destroyer of their habitats, right?
2142 2018-08-22 20:25:28 Nice try doc on the coconut oil scheme. 
1. I once had hereditary high cholesterol in my 20s BUT changed that with how I eat and drink.
2. If I’m away from coconut or olive oil if effects my entire body negatively.
3. It’s one small part of a large equation to attack one oil.
2143 2018-08-22 20:25:28 Why not call it a motion to increase the price that the American U miners are going to receive to mine U,which will raise the price to Utes.
Said Utes should receive subsides just like Big Oil and Renewables. 
There!
2144 2018-08-22 20:25:19 THE BASIS FOR SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE IS THIS...WE are more than capable of running our country BETTER than UK Gov are. With or without OIL!

Younger Americans, I say be careful about this character! He could walk you down the rat hole, with Cortez!!!
2147 2018-08-22 20:25:06 Supply and demand affects price, with a little help from OPEC.
Have you seen how many new licenses have been issued from U.K. regarding new drilling recently. Why would the oil companies pay that and considering a rig costs around a $1 million to hire per week on a good day?
2148 2018-08-22 20:25:06 Naw cousin, I can walk in at any given time. I think bottom shelf is $10 an eighth. “Mid” is 15 and top is 25-35 but that mid. That mid is some gas and idgaf what anyone says. You can also cop grams of oil for as low as $10 which is crazy.
2149 2018-08-22 20:24:59 Been trying to warn folks that coconut oil isn't what it's all cracked up to be
2150 2018-08-22 20:24:58 but I like olive oil. So go figure as the Americans say.
2151 2018-08-22 20:24:54 I thought they were to make the case for indy away from oil?

2157 2018-08-22 20:24:20 Wait Ik coconut oil is bad for your face but is it also bad for your hair ?
2158 2018-08-22 20:24:16 Plenty of them.  The PR firms that represent the tobacco industry, oil industry, etc.  there's a whole business out there in making bad people look good.  She's actually pretty good at it.

2162 2018-08-22 20:23:48 We need a pipeline to the east coast from the tar sands, not over the mountains. There is a tanker facility there all ready so we can sell oil to Saudi Arabia
2163 2018-08-22 20:23:48 How I come to Honda and they tell me it’ll be one hour and a half for an oil change and I come to the waiting area and there’s only one other chick waiting???? 
2164 2018-08-22 20:23:45 For sure! I have some gems! That Oil Can Boyd card brought back memories!
2165 2018-08-22 20:23:42 I remember the ‘79 referendum and oil was running out.

Then the McCrone rpeort came out.

Then in 2014 BBC news came out as a propaganda unit for the union.

Then I realised that the Sec State for Scotland was just WM man in Scotland.

So excuse me if I look elsewhere for facts.
2166 2018-08-22 20:23:28 There are people on twitter that are triggered over coconut oil idk how much longer i can keep this app
2167 2018-08-22 20:23:12 Calling coconut oil bad is under the same umbrella of exaggeration an when someone said juicing was unhealthy. If you have zero idea what you're doing it can be unhealthy but it is always better than the alternative, "vegetable" oils, canola oil, etc.
2168 2018-08-22 20:23:10 literally everything we do today requires oil. only 2% americans are family farmers, do you know what this means? we are addicted to oil, and we need an intervention, our lifestyle is only possible by stealing oil from "third world nations", we are the ones causing mass suffering

2174 2018-08-22 20:22:11 Why do We bend over to keep this barbaric nation happy? I'm no expert but money and oil will be a factor.
2175 2018-08-22 20:22:10 I'm going into this article with the attitude that she's aging like a warm banana and coconut oil didn't fix it for her.
2176 2018-08-22 20:22:05 This may be a dumb question but since coconut oil liquifies at what, 74 or 76 degrees(?)...wouldn't it not harden in the body while you're alive?  But then same thing for butter I guess, too.
2177 2018-08-22 20:22:03 Ive heard jojoba oil is better for facial moisturizer!
2178 2018-08-22 20:21:58 Oil prices are rising toots
2179 2018-08-22 20:21:51 I know, what is so hard to understand?! You don't seem to get that prices go up and down, world markets influence price and that the longer you extract the more costly it gets to extract the oil as it's deeper.

Get it?

2183 2018-08-22 20:21:26 One suggestion,  stick to CANADAS ISSUES  instead of trying to be a POSTER BOY.  STOP THE ILLEGAL BORDWER CROSSINGS , GET THE PIPELINE BUILT INSTEAD OF IMPORTING OIL, STOP  THE CARBON TAX , LAWS ( TOUGH) IN PLACE FOR MARIJUANA USAGE. TAX LIKE TOBACCO USERS.
2184 2018-08-22 20:21:25 Very prescient to mark in the oil rigs.

2188 2018-08-22 20:21:19 @MarkReardonKMOX did I hear that the oil industry is asking our government to protect their infrastructure from raising ocean levels caused by global warming?   So many things wrong with this request.

It’s possible that coconut oil, whole grains and fat free foods aren’t that great for you, amirite?
2194 2018-08-22 20:20:41 Where are the men in oil and gas
2195 2018-08-22 20:20:29 
2196 2018-08-22 20:20:24 Favebook is a hand tool of oil dollars and devils' interest. Keep up with your work. We stand by you.
2197 2018-08-22 20:20:14 OK coconut oil might not be the best thing for food but I've been rubbing it into my hand on a burn and it's bringing the scar down like

2200 2018-08-22 20:19:51 Pint of oil pairs great with forest salmon
2201 2018-08-22 20:19:43 It doesn't matter about GDP
 oil production is often manipulated for political purpose
Being an oil producing country does stabilise your currency
Although bizarrely the American dollar benefits as Saudi Arabia has adopted it
2202 2018-08-22 20:19:30 So coconut oil eh? What a bummer #coconutoil #ruinmyday
2203 2018-08-22 20:19:27 I need a new oil sticker bc mechanics are gonna start thinking I'm killing my engine
2204 2018-08-22 20:19:19 Well I won't be giving Sam coconut oil anymore.
2205 2018-08-22 20:19:17 The are still not sure about coffee whether its good or bad or even chocolates and not they are talking abt coconut oil which they hardly use. This is the Western universities.Take money and publish some report and then backtrack after 6 months.Confused and malinnged intent
2206 2018-08-22 20:19:11 i use tea tree oil for blemishes but I have red marks for months after sometimes. I’ve tried a few diff products and nothing
2207 2018-08-22 20:19:10 If Coconut Oil is poison, is coconut poison too? Or is it only when it’s processed and made into oil? Can coconut go on pizza? Oooo, Pepperoni and Coconut Pizza.
2208 2018-08-22 20:19:03 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
2209 2018-08-22 20:18:58 i freaking HATE when oil pops while you’re cooking, im now super bURNT and my heart is racing, why is cooking so scary
2210 2018-08-22 20:18:56 put a lil olive oil on their paws and let them walk around ur current place. it’ll pick up the scent and then when u move them they’ll feel more comfortable
2211 2018-08-22 20:18:55 Should they ask about oil workers in Colorado also?
2212 2018-08-22 20:18:47 You cant be to careful in the pond . many a minnow met their fate .
2213 2018-08-22 20:18:39 All these Americans steal our ideas use them then claim that they are unhealthy, I don’t see any coconut oil related deaths lately
2214 2018-08-22 20:18:27 I use coconut oil for lube. 
2215 2018-08-22 20:18:24 Oh good grief - and they’re promoting sunflower oil instead!
2216 2018-08-22 20:18:14 For oily hair:

- 4 strawberries  (mash these up with a fork)

Lemon mask:  
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp honey  
- 1 egg yolk egg  
- 1 tbsp aloe vera gel 
2217 2018-08-22 20:18:13 Getting your oil changed in your hometown of 30 people : oh hey Ash how is your mom, daddy sisters oh yeah I went to school with your aunt. Here is a discount. #alrightythen
2218 2018-08-22 20:18:11 while we’re talking @beausloane24 i took ur advice about cetaphil and tea tree oil and then i found a whole vegan tea tree skin care range and honestly??? my skin has never looked better so beau u literally cleared my skin love that
2219 2018-08-22 20:18:09 The peoples who live on coconut and coconut oil and milk do not suffer from disease like poor ignorant westerners do. This professor is a puppet of the oil industry.
2220 2018-08-22 20:18:04 Turns out coconut oil is worse for you than lard lmao
2221 2018-08-22 20:17:53 In the  Santiago Chile Delta Crown Room, yrs ago, I loved it for a coupla' hours, especially the wine, cheese,  and Monte Cristo olive oil.    Better 'n sex.    Wow.  Find Monte Cristo olive oil and marry it to great bread.  @EmbajadaEEUUcl
2222 2018-08-22 20:17:44 tRump doesn’t have a good grasp of anything other than being a con artist! The man is a snake oil salesman who has conned his way to everything he’s ever gotten! #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #ImpeachCabinet
2223 2018-08-22 20:17:40 So if oil price falls just another $5 what incentive is there to extract the oil? They'd have lost their marbles if they continued at that
2224 2018-08-22 20:17:30 ahh you are jptop7...i wasnt sure.
2225 2018-08-22 20:17:26 Piss poor journalism. Coconut oil and olive oil are bothe incredibly healthy. Corn, soybean and other processed seed oils are the unhealthy ones.
2226 2018-08-22 20:17:24 It’s my cars 3rd birthday today so I bought her some new tires and an oil change 
2227 2018-08-22 20:17:21 The Word i got this morning while preaching: TODAY is a turning point in eternity. Make it count. I went on to get an oil change, feeling uneasy in my heart all day, i went for a walk and met a local pastor. He invited me to a concert and worship. 
Today is indeed a turning point
2228 2018-08-22 20:17:15 I'm glad you clarified "which" dog
2229 2018-08-22 20:17:06 Excellent news that this afternoon's fire at the Essar Refinery has been put out by brave firefighters & workers and our members are safe & sound. The oil industry is one of the most dangerous industries across the world.
2230 2018-08-22 20:17:03 i let my mom take my truck to get an oil change and now i’m just panicking
2231 2018-08-22 20:16:56 This coconut oil story may be the TEA OF THE YEAR MY GOD
2232 2018-08-22 20:16:52 Give us back real chocolate  -  get rid of palm oil.
2233 2018-08-22 20:16:52 Trader Joe's has it super cheap. We cook with it in place of olive oil sometimes and it's great for your hair.
2234 2018-08-22 20:16:45 Go figure.
Now coconut oil is 'pure poison.'
Red wine is good for you.
Red wine is bad for you.
Coffee is good for you.
Coffee is bad for you.
And on and on....
Scientists, 
MAKE UP YOUR MINDS.
Can't believe anything anymore.
2235 2018-08-22 20:16:36 Namibians inject coconut oil into their veins, the crazy pissed bastards.
2236 2018-08-22 20:16:30 A woman and her two young daughters were strangled and buried in oil, yet the right doesn't even address domestic violence. 
Or even the fact this guy was employed by one of your guys....
2237 2018-08-22 20:16:17 If I'm saying something stupid or ignorant please point me in the right direction.  I'm under the impression we have an agreement that Saudi Arabia will only sell their oil using the US Dollar.  This helps secure the US dollar the default currency of world.

2240 2018-08-22 20:16:09 Jeez my dream.
2241 2018-08-22 20:16:07 So so stupid. In my area only coconut oil is used for cooking for hundreds of years. People used to live more than 90 years healthily unlike in the west.
2242 2018-08-22 20:16:04 I really can't use that coconut oil straightener on my hair though it itched my neck and I had to wash it off
2243 2018-08-22 20:16:02 No hair oil or something?
2244 2018-08-22 20:15:46 Try our kickin' new Pauly Shore's Spin-Roasted Cheddar Breakfast Sandwich. This daddy's floating in Wilting Spinach-slapped Pork Belly Oil and served on a carpet sample! Bitchin'!
2245 2018-08-22 20:15:45 Raise your hand if you bought the snake oil @realDonaldTrump was selling
2246 2018-08-22 20:15:38 Coconut oil and coconut milk have been PROVEN excellent for health in general. This professor must have been bought by the oil industry whose sales went down due to popularity of coconut oil.
2247 2018-08-22 20:15:37 Makeup tip : put a drop of coconut oil in your mascara. 
Your welcome 
2248 2018-08-22 20:15:36 Hey guys too. I put coconut oil in my locs. Definitely thought it helped.
2249 2018-08-22 20:15:32 Chamomile tea does it for me! That and lavender oil in the diffuser
2250 2018-08-22 20:15:26 I slipped on a puddle of oil in the lot and fucked up my jeans. Happy Wednesday!!! i luv the vja parking lot!!!!!
2251 2018-08-22 20:15:16 My face is one big oil slick today
2252 2018-08-22 20:15:13 Oil rallied $2 today on pretty much nothing. Yes, it was oversold. Yes the DOE stats were not bad (who cares) and Yes, macro factors hit the bottom... markets for you!
2253 2018-08-22 20:15:12 About to make special shake of power: natty coconut malk (Trader Joe's has no additives), much cocoa, coconut oil, coconut sugar, glycine, collagen, whey, then I will put in freezer briefly
2254 2018-08-22 20:15:01 They are lying! They want people sick, coconut oil is good.
2255 2018-08-22 20:14:39 I just received from my oil of the month a beautiful tropical synergy that has hints of anise and almond in it. Would you recommend straight diffusion with this wonderful uplifting  scent, or any additional oils to mix with it? I can’t wait to try it! #essentialoils
2256 2018-08-22 20:14:29 Fire business idea - I’m gonna sale Body oil for women’s and call it stripper sweat
2257 2018-08-22 20:14:28 Love the cleansing oil conditioner
2258 2018-08-22 20:14:23 I will never understand why people celebrate friends birthdays by pouring them water, oil, drinks and all sorts. Madness and nothing more.
2259 2018-08-22 20:14:15 #Kerala a State of #India now severely affected by #Floods is addicted to #Coconut Oil. #Kerlites ar #Healthy, #Brainy and laborious too. So they ar #Rich since generations. Who says #Coconut Oil #Poisoneous? @nytimes @globaltimesnews @japantimes @htTweets @ttindia @timesofindia
2260 2018-08-22 20:14:11 @cnni Would you care to report on how many millions of Fiipinos have died from consuming coconut oil? Sensationalized, pseudo-scientific and ignorant putdowns of coconut oil make us cringe.

2262 2018-08-22 20:13:59 it’s so hot my coconut oil melted lmao
2263 2018-08-22 20:13:56 Lmao at coconut oil not being good for you.
2264 2018-08-22 20:13:53 Correct, because it does not contain THC, which is what gets you high. THC free CBD oil can be bought over the counter. You can even get it on Amazon.
2265 2018-08-22 20:13:41 Why do you think Venezuela’s economic situation is worse than Iran’s, which also is affected by the oil price and has suffered far greater US sanctions than Venezuela?   Iran also suffers from corruption and large military expenditure.
2266 2018-08-22 20:13:35 What?! Nooo! I cook with coconut oil so often! I love it 
2267 2018-08-22 20:13:34 I noticed. The vegetable oil is going to leave a stain.
2268 2018-08-22 20:13:23 So coconut oil is now terrible for you  Give us a chance!
2269 2018-08-22 20:13:22 I so love the large breast and would love to rub oil on them and then have to slide down and lick that sexy kitty
2270 2018-08-22 20:13:21 I would love to have a vile..
I have anointing oil but it wasn't collected from a source like this..
2271 2018-08-22 20:13:20 Damn that oil it’s such a burden
2272 2018-08-22 20:13:19 Buying snake oil to own the libs....
2273 2018-08-22 20:13:10 Oils can't hydrate your skin, because they're not introducing moisture. Baby oil, aka mineral oil, is a pretty heavy oil. Some swear by it for Oil Cleansing Method, I haven't tried it so I can't say one way or the other.
2274 2018-08-22 20:13:03 Anything in excess is not god for health. Coconut oil is high is saturated fat and should be consumed in moderation, the fat is needed to absorb essential nutrients. Calling it a ‘poison’ is nothing but confusing consumers without any real facts.
2275 2018-08-22 20:13:02 Not really a Free Market econ due to all the subsidies by the government for oil, gas,agricorp,airports. property/income tax"forgiveness" for businesses to name a few. Oh and they just got a tax cut.We are a welfare state for the  FM economy first
2276 2018-08-22 20:13:01 Did you use a piece of plastic today? See, now, that's exactly why we need oil. Any questions?  #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
2277 2018-08-22 20:12:59 Not only "lived". A few DAYS after I started using coconut oil and coconut milk, I overcame a digestive problem that my TCM chinese doctor had unsuccessfully tried to resolve for over six months. A huge dark spot I had had on my tongue for THREE years,  immediately went away.

2279 2018-08-22 20:12:41 did you know that nikola tesla invented technology and gizmos that make oil utterly obsolete?

do you know what this means? all war and poverty is obsolete, we are only dying because some "people" are too vain to let go of their precious little power!

2285 2018-08-22 20:12:19 Ask this doctor to come visit #kerla. Pretty much everything is cooked in coconut oil and the health index of this Indian state is the best in the country for decades while other states use sunflower/vegetable oil.

2289 2018-08-22 20:12:02 Y’all should post that man that killed his wife and children then through them in oil bins. That sound like a better read
2290 2018-08-22 20:11:55 Venezuela has oil......#FollowTheWonga
2291 2018-08-22 20:11:53 No they get the byproducts of oil production
2292 2018-08-22 20:11:52 Ugh! After-work grocery shopping is soul-destroying when you're obsessing over palm oil and plastic, in addition to avoiding products from certain countries and all who test on animals, trying to watch the pennies (and the pounds) and not take all bloody day about it.

2294 2018-08-22 20:11:45 Someone got me thinking today asking for home made chips. My old man used to make the best chips. I think the fucking oil was used hundreds of times before ditched if it ever was. He also never thru out fat from bacon or sausages.
2295 2018-08-22 20:11:39 I am no fan of oil, but what if that pipeline massively reduced road transport?
2296 2018-08-22 20:11:34 Successful is being further ahead than now. We wouldn't be in short to medium term at any rate.

I've been there 8 times from Vancouver to Ottawa and a lot in between. I've spoke to oil workers in Calgary to Texas (I'm aware that's USA btw).
Ours is in the sea too. Costs a lot
2297 2018-08-22 20:11:31 Exactly. I'm an atheist and even I know Jesus wouldn't want anything to do with a preacher living in a 20,000 sq ft mansion. He's just another snake oil salesman preying on vulnerable people looking for hope
2298 2018-08-22 20:11:30 Not even coconut oil is helping my dry ass lips..lord help me before winter comes
2299 2018-08-22 20:11:27 Not with Nurse still needing to be paid and without him the Oil have no D that would be No. 1 on any team.
2300 2018-08-22 20:11:25 Body lotion, spirits and tissue oil. Works magic even on stretch marks
2301 2018-08-22 20:11:25 looks awesome though. Try coconut oil 
2302 2018-08-22 20:11:15 All women don’t not know how to take care of their car..  there are plenty of women who know how to change a tire, check the oil, coolant, tires and more so you can’t make that general statement 
2303 2018-08-22 20:11:14 It doesn't introduce moisture, so it's not going to hydrate anything, not your face nor your body nor your hair. Putting any oil on lashes/brows seems to make them grow quicker in my experience.

2305 2018-08-22 20:11:13 Absolute nonsense. Yes coconut oil is high in saturated fats however there is evidence that coconut saturated fats ACT DIFFERENTLY than saturated fats of animals when entering our body.

2311 2018-08-22 20:10:26 I’m not sure how much of that was due to Nixon’s constitutional issues. ‘73 oil shock, rampaging inflation,  and a stock market much more tied to the 4 year presidential cycle than we have now were all key factors. NYC near bankruptcy to follow shortly. #ballofconfusion

2317 2018-08-22 20:09:57 I've really liked The Real Marigold Hotel, but I'm gritting my teeth in exasperation at the credulous bollocks they're spouting about "ayurvedic" treatments. Your liver does a fine job of clearing toxins; you definitely don't need a load of oil squirted up your arse for that.
2318 2018-08-22 20:09:50 Easily recoverable oil is nearly gone
2319 2018-08-22 20:09:43 everybody knows coconut oil is overrated bs.
2320 2018-08-22 20:09:41 Canola oil...ha ha
2321 2018-08-22 20:09:41 This girl I'm working with today is so....odd. She brought a little jar of peppermint oil and put it on her hand, and every 3 minutes I can hear her sniffing her hand loudly.
2322 2018-08-22 20:09:31 It's not the oil in your cooking, it's the half pound of peanut butter M&Ms for dessert.
2323 2018-08-22 20:09:29 Or maybe we should consume more of that shelf stable vegetable oil? #Theytryingtokillusall
2324 2018-08-22 20:09:25 What do you judge successful on Adam? Have you ever been to Canada, you do know they extract a lot of oil from shale which is even costlier than drilling?

2328 2018-08-22 20:09:07 Oil is collateral on the international money markets. Without it, the UK would have difficulty borrowing and servicing its debts.

That's why Scotland must be kept in the Union.
2329 2018-08-22 20:09:07 Well coconut oil is canceled!
2330 2018-08-22 20:09:02 They seem to have a double standard, when it comes to trade deals they are insisting gender equality play a part in the negotiations but continue to import Saudi oil. Do the Saudis get a pass because they execute and jail just as many women as men?
2331 2018-08-22 20:08:59 Atlantic Council are you serious? They are the long arm of NATO funded by governments involved with NATO, big oil companies, Saudi Arabia. You should check who funds the think tanks before jumping to conclusions!

 Now if you have a million barrels of oil and it goes up by 1$ does that mean wow..And if you have a billion how does the valuation of a company stand on a daily basis with that price fluctuation on bpod

2334 2018-08-22 20:08:24 I did rather wonder where his loyalties lay. What with so many of the 9/11 terrorists being Saudi nationals while we waged war on Afghans & Iraqis but not Saudi Arabia. (Noting that it was *Bin Laden* family money that he borrowed to save his Arbusto Oil Co. from bankruptcy.)
2335 2018-08-22 20:08:14 Never seen unreliable traders like Akara people. Pour red oil on the yam.
2336 2018-08-22 20:08:10 Everyone is an expert n everything is a fad. Co oil is sat fat. U need some fats in ur diet. I use olive to cook w n in dressings, flaxseed in smoothies n sesame in Chinese. Oil is not an entree. There are no superfoods. Just food.  How's that? 
2337 2018-08-22 20:08:09 GHOST HANDS COMMISSIONS WHERE ONE OR TWO OF THEM ARE JERKING ME OFF AND GROPING ME BUT ALL OF THE OTHER ONES ARE DOING HELPFUL LIFE SHIT LIKE MY TAXES, MOWING MY LAWN, FIXING ME A POT OF COFFEE, AND GIVING MY CAR AN OIL CHANGE AT THE SAME TIME
2338 2018-08-22 20:08:04 That's why he's got a program of returning to the biosphere all the carbon that had been sequestered in the form of oil and coal for millions of years.
2339 2018-08-22 20:08:01 All olive oil is basically flavored canola oil. So it could be canola oil lobby.

2341 2018-08-22 20:07:57 Here's a quick question, why is it always about oil?

Oil has fallen massively in price, costs a load to extract and we are slowly moving away from using it to same extent. 
What's the plan for Scotland in 30 years? Yes have never had 1
2342 2018-08-22 20:07:54 Also, in original 22 countries study, Ceylon had same low CVD rate as Japan - low fat diet, but all cooking done with coconut oil.
2343 2018-08-22 20:07:51 Getting my @Hyundai #ElantraGT oil change #KillianAutomotive, they rock.  If you live in Canton, I highly recommend them.

2345 2018-08-22 20:07:30 I think it's a  horrible idea and oil is the main reason we have forest fires ravaging our province!! We don't need to double any pipelines we don't need more of this we need infrastructure for energy that doesn't destroy poison and cause global warming.
2346 2018-08-22 20:07:29 "Erdogan knows very well what’s he’s really “guilty” of: buying the S-400s, ditching the “Assad must go” obsession, advancing Turkish Stream and insisting Turkey will continue to buy Iranian oil."
2347 2018-08-22 20:07:28 Yes lets' just buy oil from Saudi instead! Honestly these lefties are thick.
2348 2018-08-22 20:07:26 everyone please stop putting coconut oil in you’re hair it does nothing for it
2349 2018-08-22 20:07:17 This dude getting $$$$$ from the industry. Coconut oil aint bad for ya
2350 2018-08-22 20:07:09 But he’s unfortunately not deviating on foreign policy. He gives energy companies anything they want also. Two big sources of GOP money - defense industry and oil/gas industry - likely in love with Trump.
2351 2018-08-22 20:07:08 Has to be. Now he must be getting "paid" by canola oil industry.
2352 2018-08-22 20:07:08 Excuse me sir but do you know what friction is? If not tends to make things heat up really fast. And when things heat up..they melt, and when things with gas, oil, and electrical components melt, they explode. Also metal isn’t very bouncy. Tends to just break and chunk.
2353 2018-08-22 20:07:03 That’s a position I support. We need to get at the demand side of oil. Building/not building the Trans Mountain doesn’t do anything either way with respect to our demand. A carbon tax will. We need that right now.
2354 2018-08-22 20:06:48 Have a feeling there are some stats are about to come out about oil revenues that have the yoons kieching their breeks! #DissolveTheUnion
2355 2018-08-22 20:06:44 American destroyed Libya, Afghanistan, and now Watching UG. Hmmm. I have remembered UG has Oil btw
2356 2018-08-22 20:06:39 Depends on successful. Is successful as good as we have it now? Not short to medium term and certainly not with bogus left wing policies which are eroding Scotland now.
Eh no we aren't. Canada is way ahead in amount and our oil is costly to extract.
2357 2018-08-22 20:06:32 What is the point of coconut oil? Taste? Health benefits? I don't understand the point when there are many other less expensive & healthier options....
2358 2018-08-22 20:06:14 There are about 1.3 billion of us wanting to deep fry this 'claim' in coconut oil and feed it to a stray dog. @Harvard you got conned.
2359 2018-08-22 20:05:54 Wish they were taking this stance in November!
2360 2018-08-22 20:05:52 When you go in for an oil change and come out $284,047 poorer.

2363 2018-08-22 20:05:17 Well Coconut oil is just good for your face and hair etc
2364 2018-08-22 20:05:06 If I go away on a trip and I call home the first question I’m going to ask is did u get the oil changed for my car #forthecars
2365 2018-08-22 20:04:57 Oil  to save @UNMLoboMSoccer ? I hope so.
2366 2018-08-22 20:04:47 My skin is super sensitive, I mean my face .. coconut oil makes me feel like I have 3rd burns. But I do have a coconut scrub that doesn't bother me. I think the amount of coconut oil in it, is mostly for fragrance though.
2367 2018-08-22 20:04:46 Renewable energy sourced by lithium which is even worse than oil and petrol. And he didn’t spearhead it he just put a price on it so the 1% feel validated. And him sending a car to space for shits and giggles doesn’t equate to the fact he funds anti equality groups
2368 2018-08-22 20:04:44 Who tf thought coconut oil was HEALTHY?! If you look at the label at all it says how bad it is. I don't get it.
2369 2018-08-22 20:04:31 Beginning to run like oil paint.
2370 2018-08-22 20:04:30 Me: “all I got left is an oil change on your car I’ll be done soon”
Old man: “can you hurry please my old lady wants to get pregnant and I wanna be there for that.”
2371 2018-08-22 20:04:16 And no it isn't. Only oil-and-gas paid contrarian scientists believe that when we can trace the warming and levels of CO2 directly.
2372 2018-08-22 20:03:29 Hash oil pulled from the gelato strain
2373 2018-08-22 20:03:27 Wow, knew about methane, but didn't realize oil and coal were also in the mix. Can't help wondering what Toyota et al. were going to get in exchange for perpetuating hydrocarbons.
2374 2018-08-22 20:03:19 Kiulizo:Does  Bio oil work especially when it comes to fading scars?I got a bottle so before I curse out the manufactures I need assurance
2375 2018-08-22 20:03:15 Well get it on the ballot and let's see how the people feel about it. 500 ft offset is a joke. It was only a matter of time with oil companies going in and plopping a 5 acre 10 to 20 well head down beside housing complexes to finally piss people off. When they could've put it a
2376 2018-08-22 20:03:08 Why was Kyle Gibson left in for so long? Guy was leaking more oil than a broken down semi.
2377 2018-08-22 20:03:05 Awh mate you need to go and learn what actual communism is. And that they are an oil based capitalist economy. If I were you I would delete this tweet. As your stupidity shows no limits.
2378 2018-08-22 20:02:56 OMG I was gonna buy some of that do you have any recommendations for brands of tea tree oil should I use it in a mask or in a cleanser or what 
2379 2018-08-22 20:02:54 I meant just the coconut oil study. And separating the groups to see any differences. But, yes, the China Study convinced me that what we typically think of being “healthy” is marginally so.
2380 2018-08-22 20:02:44 what if BP Oil didnt stand for british petroleum
2381 2018-08-22 20:02:41 You dont need artificial boo, @Angel_phase  sells beards oil. Legit
2382 2018-08-22 20:02:32 This meme is a good time to remind: #ManafortPickedPence.  #PenceKnew ALL the #TrumpRussiaConspiracy and along with #Trump, #Pence should go to #jail, with his longtime pal, bloody #criminal mercenary for #oil and #nukes #ErikPrince should go to a jail in the UAE where he lives!
2383 2018-08-22 20:02:27 We use coconut oil for EVERYTHING. Cooking, Lotion and on the pups.  They also get a dab in their good let ~ they love it!  More uses then chicken 
2384 2018-08-22 20:02:22 Like a flame off a oil rig
2385 2018-08-22 20:02:20 I RAN OUT OF FUCKING VEGETABLE OIL FUCK OFF
2386 2018-08-22 20:02:17 what is gelato oil?
2387 2018-08-22 20:02:16 I didn't know this. Been using so much coconut oil to prepoo 
2388 2018-08-22 20:02:15 sometimes the only reason God gives you a woman is to teach you how to make homemade mashed potatoes, show you the power of tea tree oil, and to lead you to the profession that He wants you to use to glorify His name. you can’t knock that shit my nigga.
2389 2018-08-22 20:02:11 Effects of too much drilling into the earths for Oil and other minerals there by releasing unknown amounts of pressure from the earths crust into the atmosphere & too much production & use of Weapons like missiles,Stored Nukes,chemicals & plastic waste dumped in the oceans etc
2390 2018-08-22 20:02:09 Maybe this is a bad analogy, but to me using CBD oil like that is sort of like using alcohol when cooking. Drinking alcohol to take advantage of its intoxicating effects is against the WoW, but using it only for its flavor while cooking is not.
2391 2018-08-22 20:01:57 US govt officials have even visited DPRK over the past 20 years. The IRI clearly wants this animosity w/ US as it prefers pariah status. Unfortunately many educated ppl don't understand this & celebrate "wins" e.g., some buying Iranian oil under market!
2392 2018-08-22 20:01:54 They’re trying to demonize coconut oil  smh
2393 2018-08-22 20:01:45 Looks like a rotary vane.  Oil flooded?    I usually used liquid ring type in my processes....
2394 2018-08-22 20:01:31 How can we be sure that texts from the past are as genuine as we think?  Can snake oil salesmen behavior really be a modern pattern of behavior in humans?  To me it is likely that it has been around for a long while.

2395 2018-08-22 20:01:31 Time to wag the dog release the oil reserves. Lower price of gas and force an infrastructure bill to fix the bridges
2396 2018-08-22 20:01:27 avocado oil any good?
2397 2018-08-22 20:01:24 Bi oil !
2398 2018-08-22 20:01:18 Come to think of it they really should just bring back shop class, home ec, and beginner automotive and call it life skills bc we all need to know how to do the very basic things like boil water, check the oil, or change a bulb.
2399 2018-08-22 20:01:16 More convinced than ever the upcoming bull market in #oil and oil equities will be powerfull. #NatGas will do okay as well. After buying today my energy portfolio is pretty much set. Added Baytex, Athabasca Oil, Cenovus and Vermilion.
2400 2018-08-22 20:01:12 Lol you’re a horrible dog dad. I think you’re suppose to mix coconut oil to his shampoo to make his coat shiny, and healthy.
2401 2018-08-22 20:01:11 Possibly referring to opening national forests/parks to oil exploration by private interests.
2402 2018-08-22 20:01:03 For those interested in #theoc #SoCal: There is an informational meeting @newportbeachgov & @NewportCouncil at 7:00 PM on potential impact of #Trump 's Administration opening up drilling along our coast. #environment #Oil #drilling

2404 2018-08-22 20:01:00 I have always disliked coconut oil! Too damn thick.
2405 2018-08-22 20:00:57 Pig oil &plenty of it
2406 2018-08-22 20:00:46 .... you literally just said you would consume the oil yourself
2407 2018-08-22 20:00:43 Norway's income from oil last year was 144 Billion Krona. Scotland apparently only made just over £3 Billon.
2408 2018-08-22 20:00:43 I wish they would hurry up w/ my oil change so I can go back to sleep until 8
2409 2018-08-22 20:00:43 Thinking of this: Trump is passionately hated by Democrats and Republicans and has congress in an uproar. Jesus would be proud of our president giving him the strength to fight all these criminals!
2410 2018-08-22 20:00:38 Make soap. Coconut oil makes soaps that produce great lather.
2411 2018-08-22 20:00:36 “Canadian production of crude oil & equivalent products rose 13.5% from 1 year earlier”
-@StatCan_eng 
Production is rising & the bottlenecks remain. If we want to take advantage of a growing demand for #Canadian #oil we need #pipelines. Period.

2416 2018-08-22 20:00:05 Last RT. So coconut oil is poison? Hmmm not so sure about that. Harvard professors are usually trustworthy and venerable but the research industry is very wild.
2417 2018-08-22 20:00:03 Y no te dicen que los que dieron el golpe en el 55, estaban codo a codo con Perón en el golpe del 1943, ni que dieron el golpe por el "giro liberal" de Perón, tras el arreglo con la Standard Oil.
2418 2018-08-22 20:00:03 There are many well-known ways to use #turmeric – in teas, coffee, rice, soup and curry. However, have you heard of turmeric-infused oils? Chefs are now combining coconut oil with turmeric roots for those extra nutrient boosts in cooking! #CookingTips #HealthyEating
2419 2018-08-22 19:59:48 It would have been a success story if they just did not squander their fiat's believability and sold their oil for gold, platinum, technology, bitcoin and invested in their country.
2420 2018-08-22 19:59:44 Also worked as project manager for another company and when I took over I fired all illegals. Had several resident aliens I hired, but they didnt like me getting rid of illegals and they fired me. No big deal, went on to bigger and better things.
2421 2018-08-22 19:59:44 And crickets about the white guy who killed his wife, unborn son 2 daughters and dumped them in oil barrels. Oh yeah white crime.

2423 2018-08-22 19:59:33 It was rather late at night, but she had finished up a project ahe held dear to herself and  knew  where it could be of use. Her hands were stained with dwarven oil  and she seemed tired as Elysil stood before @Lucius_TES's door, an item wrapped in cloth craddled in her arms.
2424 2018-08-22 19:59:21 Coconut oil has been hyped up and for no reason. Wtf benefits do y’all get from it because that shit has NEVER did anything for me and i tried so hard to believe it was 
2425 2018-08-22 19:59:20 Coconut oil is not fuckin' poison but gosh you shouldn't be eating a metric buttload of oil in the first place, regardless of where it came from
2426 2018-08-22 19:59:14 Anyhow, done with my workout, shower and sleep noe.
2427 2018-08-22 19:59:10 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
2428 2018-08-22 19:59:09 Like clockwork. People from across the globe can attest to the benefits of UNREFINED coconut oil but 1 white guy has the answers? Tuh
2429 2018-08-22 19:59:07 Came in for a damn oil change & now I gotta buy tires & an alignment. Wtf 
2430 2018-08-22 19:58:58 Lmfao coconut oil is not pure poison. Smh. Fuckin’ white ppl. Tbh I’m offended. Obviously don’t fucking chug gallons of it, just like you shouldn’t do with any other food. Health is a lifestyle. There is no magic food 
2431 2018-08-22 19:58:57 Coconut oil are made up of Medium Chain Triglycerides which is very good for your body. This lady doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
2432 2018-08-22 19:58:57 If this beautiful spot was in the US djt would probably give some oil company the rights to drill for oil there.
2433 2018-08-22 19:58:54 What about the 37BN in oil from unknown source,which leaves in Tankers and doesn't come ashore so it`s not included in GERS, What about that money Ruth,37BILLION
2434 2018-08-22 19:58:54 Why do you do that? Why follow someone and then unfollow them after they followed you? 
2435 2018-08-22 19:58:23 But what about my oil's purpose? THINK ABOUT IT
2436 2018-08-22 19:58:19 The comments to this article are priceless and I'm going to buy the biggest jar of coconut oil I can find next time I'm shopping.
2437 2018-08-22 19:58:12 Damn.  She just opened herself and Harvard University up for a defamation lawsuit by the coconut oil industry, much like Oprah was sued by the beef industry
2438 2018-08-22 19:58:04 Wow. Quite apart from GERS being total nonsense, Scotland giving you its oil and natural resources, and housing your hideous nuclear weapons, why is the U.K. Gov dissing Scotland and promoting this? Is that even legal?!
2439 2018-08-22 19:58:03 What’re your thoughts on cbd oil?
2440 2018-08-22 19:58:01 Domenica came and got my car and brought it to get an oil change for me. She’s so great
2441 2018-08-22 19:57:56 Theres 100s of images of known IS fighters stood side-by-side with both TFSA & Turkish soldiers in Afrin. I think the pretense is over by now. And yes Turkey and IS have had fights with each other from time to time that doesn't make them enemies. There is proof of oil deals also.
2442 2018-08-22 19:57:54 @sweetnihilst Welp, guess theres no more point to life if coconut oil is bad for us
2443 2018-08-22 19:57:53 Every 1k electric busses reduces fuel use by 500bpd of oil or diesel?
2444 2018-08-22 19:57:51 Was following Dal to drop her car off for oil change and parked next to her and looked in and it was an old lady in a newer version of dals car lmao I have no clue how and when I started following a random lady

2451 2018-08-22 19:57:14 What I hate is that fake ass butter for movie popcorn. Greasy and taste like oil.
2452 2018-08-22 19:57:02 Politicize terrible tragedy much? 
No word from any of you at the WH on the white American citizen who killed his wife & two daughters (left them submerged in oil) last week. 
People do terrible things to each other but one doesn't stop to check the heritage of every evil killer.
2453 2018-08-22 19:56:50 *thinking* The Supreme Leader really takes his grandpa as a rolemodel... But the oil was his own idea I guess...
2454 2018-08-22 19:56:46 Cuz they are cleary fried in hippy oil
2455 2018-08-22 19:56:45 Only half a benadryl so I'm coherent, a Tylenol, and some caffeine (usually hot mint green tea) and it backs off enough to keep functioning. Sometimes mint oil on temples/forehead.
2456 2018-08-22 19:56:39 I’d also see how much you can find on Church websites. I know there hasn’t been a ton (if anything) said specifically about CBD oil, but I think it’s worth a look.
2457 2018-08-22 19:56:34 I’m slicker than a can of oil ma’am lol
2458 2018-08-22 19:56:30 What moron OKed this piece? I never expected to get fiber and minerals from coconut oil or any oil for that matter. I also don't expect baked or fried goods, with or without coconut oil, to provide nutritional requirements. Looking forward to the next study that says water is wet
2459 2018-08-22 19:56:28 coconut oil smells like a urinal cake, not at all surprised that it's bad for you
2460 2018-08-22 19:56:26 The US dollar nudged a bit lower, oil prices rose, US bond yields ranged, and US equities remained elevated but little changed. The FOMC minutes didn’t get much of a market response.
2461 2018-08-22 19:56:15 Fraud might as well be his middle name. Was one thing when he was a snake oil salesman who ran a dumb tv show. Now he's running the country. It's still hard to believe so many of them fell for it.
2462 2018-08-22 19:56:11 So across my job there’s a cbd oil company that sells to any age.. do y’all think it’ll show up on a drug test ?? Because I’ve needed help sleeping lately 
2463 2018-08-22 19:56:02 Ugh anxiety is the absolute worse. Just try to take your CBD oil regularly! I wish I could just wave a wand and take it away from all of us 
2464 2018-08-22 19:55:46 Yeah, also thinking about tires/oil/etc.
2465 2018-08-22 19:55:31 The only "pure poison" is what's coming out of this "Harvard Professors" mouth.
Shes probably on the payroll of a Palm Oil company....
2466 2018-08-22 19:55:24 Don't forget to include...
Oil of I'm okay, Im okay 
2467 2018-08-22 19:55:23 Why haven’t I been coming here for oil changes. Women so dumb 
2468 2018-08-22 19:55:18 In the future we’re all gonna wear clothes that have been soaked in jojoba oil so that our skin doesn’t get dry
2469 2018-08-22 19:55:07 I went to a store in manassas to look at products and they let me sample some of the oil on the spot, ofc it doesn’t hit immediately but if you wanted to try some before purchasing u maybe could!
2470 2018-08-22 19:55:02 #WeTheMajority are NOT stupid. Your “tax cuts” are for the top 1%. Which we will reverse come November. Your 3 Ring Circus is coming to an end. And the snake oil salesman will be fired first.
2471 2018-08-22 19:54:46 We're not mad at ya! Add some CBD oil to your drink or take a Bluegrass shot to reduce anxiety!
2472 2018-08-22 19:54:45 @boomsbustsshow  been saying for months a major correction can happen anytime in oil but trend is up.  Until it isn't.
2473 2018-08-22 19:54:43 Just found out I am allergic to peanuts. Chickfila cooks their chicken in peanut oil. Yeah, my life is over
2474 2018-08-22 19:54:14 The past couple of days have been a struggle to get out of bed and do *anything*. An overwhelming numbness and exhaustion. Like I am weighted. I am wondering if it's herxing from the oil of oregano. If so, how long will it take before I start feeling better?
2475 2018-08-22 19:54:11 I'll eat raw organic vegan food, take sea salt lavender baths and do sound healing and physical exercising to get thru it, CBD oil is great too but I am tired of it all. Some days I'm ready to give up.
2476 2018-08-22 19:54:07 We need our own currency so we can print our own money when we need to and the sinking ship of England post #Brexit will make Sterling one of the least attractive currencies for investors. A Scottish currency backed by oil, other natural resources & in the EU will be a safe bet.
2477 2018-08-22 19:54:06 She a malfunctioning Replicant in desperate need of a tune up.  Maybe an Oil can will do it for her.......If she only had a heart.
2478 2018-08-22 19:54:00 Maybe he needs cocoNUT oil instead to help, I bet he didnt even try it himself
2479 2018-08-22 19:53:57 lemon+peppermint+eucalyptus might just be my new favorite essential oil diffuser blend. im doing it to relieve sinus pressure and it smells so good
2480 2018-08-22 19:53:44 She's literally attached to my leg licking all the coconut oil off.  Even while I try & get stuff done.
2481 2018-08-22 19:53:37 Very true!! Joined before the plastic @ManCity fans who joined after oil money was splashed!! @VincentKompany is a true Man City player coz he has never compared that shit money minded club to the great @ManUtd!!
2482 2018-08-22 19:53:33 Sitting in a Santa Cruz coffee shop, drinking a very spicy iced chai, listening to two 60+ year old hippy ladies discuss shielding and tea tree oil disinfectants for their feet. Definitely home.
2483 2018-08-22 19:53:26 @ashleymaytweets sweet clickbait article about coconut oil you wrote.  Could you be any more sensationalist?  You almost got my younger brother believing crap b/c of a garbage headline.  What happened to honest reporting?
2484 2018-08-22 19:53:21 In 2000 was associated with a manufacturing plant that employed all illegals. No E-Verify far as I know, but it took several yrs for IRS to send no match notice to SS. Routine was to just ask them to submit  different number.
2485 2018-08-22 19:53:19 21:52 and someone is burning that cooking oil fml 
2486 2018-08-22 19:53:18 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa. I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating doughnut instead of rubbing the oil on his head.

2487 2018-08-22 19:53:17 U know it’s always oil g 
2488 2018-08-22 19:53:17 They need to secure they could get a grab of Oil fields first just like how it happens in the Middle East!
2489 2018-08-22 19:53:14 The guy's a snake and you're selling the oil.  Only the best?  You're a charlatan.
2490 2018-08-22 19:53:08 Coconut oil, tea tree oil and coca butter sound like a cold ass mix
2491 2018-08-22 19:52:57 Yeah kinda monopolize the cooking oil industry lol
2492 2018-08-22 19:52:50 Coconut oil is actually terrible for you? Huh.
2493 2018-08-22 19:52:32 you're using oil 4k you're complaining go and talk to people using Mobil 1 you'll understand
2494 2018-08-22 19:52:13 Wealth fund isnt built in a day of course but depending heavily on a single commodity like oil can be risky too. Pakistan can be much more diverse in nature. I dont even need to list here the industries that could have been huge now if proper planning was done 20 years ago.
2495 2018-08-22 19:52:03 Recent study says coconut oil is not healthy. Well, no problem. I always stick to my beans made in lard.
2496 2018-08-22 19:51:58 If we weren’t lining the pockets of the yanks, we’d more than be able to compete with sugar daddy oil money, renovate the South Stand & reduce the cost of match day pies!
2497 2018-08-22 19:51:57 and oops! oh look! today coconut oil is BAD for you.
2498 2018-08-22 19:51:53 So you think Big Cooking Oil is paying doctors professors to prevent coconut oil from making a .001% dent into their Canola and Vegetable oil profits ? 
2499 2018-08-22 19:51:44 Possible cause is lightning, was in the area at the time. Deceased woman reported in her 70s, so I guess less likely to be making oil from marijuana, a hazardous activity that occurs this time of year. Gas explosion another possibility
2500 2018-08-22 19:51:38 Especially when he knows 37BN is missing from GERS cos the oil goes on tankers for export, so  does`nt come ashore, so is not in GERS.
How can scots unionists sleep at night?
2501 2018-08-22 19:51:30 They got a bunch of casinos and oil fields throughout the state too. It’s revenue floating around I guess it’s not enough
2502 2018-08-22 19:51:28 What's infuriating is this Country Venezuela is a "Natural" success! Oil, Minerals & agricultural land & water! It's idiotic Leadership! The people want stable government! @LouDobbs @BreitbartNews @BBCWorld @nypost @HouseCracka
2503 2018-08-22 19:51:27 Ladies, make sure you always leave your car running while you’re changing the oil, or else it all won’t come out!!!!!!
2504 2018-08-22 19:51:09 “Take out the oil
Zambane, y’a know it,
FFFFURAY’SH” 

Rrrrha
2505 2018-08-22 19:50:59 Oh in that case I'm drinking 10ml of coconut oil poison everyday, and it is keeping my pancreas strong and helping my thyroid problem.
2506 2018-08-22 19:50:50 Aloha Maui, Maui Express Car Wash will be closed in preparation of Hurricane Lane and we will be back up and running on Monday. Our Maui Oil fuel pumps are still open and we will keep you updated on the status. Please stay safe, and stay off the roadways if you are able to do so.
2507 2018-08-22 19:50:45 Oil money.   That is what has them all salivating.   19.5 billion if not mistaken.
2508 2018-08-22 19:50:42 fuck coconut oil
fuck lavender oil
i hate both
2509 2018-08-22 19:50:25 Y’all my coconut oil started solidifying last night. Dats it!!! Summer is coming to an end 
2510 2018-08-22 19:50:19 A5: I always take time to brush down, wipe down, and oil machine tools after each use. Dad used to say that mess traps moisture, moisture brings rust, and rust brings inaccuracies. #MakersHour
2511 2018-08-22 19:49:56 Looks like it’s going to be a good day. All being well I’ll get over can smell the two stroke oil already
2512 2018-08-22 19:49:52 I need a oil change
2513 2018-08-22 19:49:51 While I love @AbbyMartin on Palestine & the Middle East as a whole, I feel she’s been disingenuous in regard to Venezuela.

She has not answered to why Venezuela had 10,000%+ inflation while other sanctioned oil countries (Russia, Iran) haven’t had nearly the same decline. /1
2514 2018-08-22 19:49:43 @bctoday I firmly believe that if the government teamed up with the Alberta provincial government that we could retrain those who lost their jobs in the oil crisis for green products such as solar panels and electric car production. Kill both job insecurity and gas dependence
2515 2018-08-22 19:49:30 After how many years?  But proposed oil and gas line there. We must stay?
2516 2018-08-22 19:49:22 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
2517 2018-08-22 19:49:21 No tengo el valor de decirle a mi prima de LA que el "castor oil" no es "aceite de castor".

2519 2018-08-22 19:49:15 I Am Against Oil Pipelines,& Fish Farms,& GMO,& Terminator Seeds or Any EVIL Inventions That Rape & DESTROY The Earth!They Only SERVE MONEY!
2520 2018-08-22 19:49:12 I’m sorry, pal. The vibe here blows chunks. You’ve got insane people on here and then you’ve got some normal people on here and the oil and water isn’t mixing. It’s too bad. I miss the old days.
2521 2018-08-22 19:49:12 Organic unrefined coconut oil is very good for you, the other coconut oils are bad.  It’s kind of a broad statement without stating which kind .
2522 2018-08-22 19:49:03 That’s crazy because a lot of “healthy meals” cook with coconut oil. I feel played.
2523 2018-08-22 19:49:03 Yeah this is bogus.  The evidence linking dietary saturated fat to heart disease doesn't exist. The literature is full of poorly conducted studies.  And the AHA's condemnation of coconut oil was based on a study paid for by the canola oil industry.
2524 2018-08-22 19:48:59 Palm oil is terrible for the environment. Stay away from it
2525 2018-08-22 19:48:46 How to make healthy oil choices.
Have canola, olive, coconut, and a few others in your kitchen and use just enough of the right one for the right recipe and cooking temperature!
But most importantly, watch the serving size of the end product!
Thank you for coming to my Jen Talk
2526 2018-08-22 19:48:32 Candles are high IQ, in the event dorm advisor finds out tho get an oil burner, they're cool to use afaik in dorms and have great scents
2527 2018-08-22 19:48:30 Yes, but if we care about our planet and stopping extinctions we should all stay away from #PalmOil
Coconut oil however is safe & good for you & key if you’re on Keto.
2528 2018-08-22 19:48:16 That NGO used the fuel produced by other rigs to get there, and the clothes they wore were oil byproduct. If they are so passionate about making a point, they should have swam naked to get to it. Sometimes, a slap doesn’t hurt #powerandinfluence
2529 2018-08-22 19:48:08 If only scots were not threatened by this turmoil it would be popcorn time.
Where is the unionists rage at 37BN from oil is missing from GERS,cos it goes on tankers to other countries,so does not come ashore.
37BILLION
how can unionists accept that and still sleep?
2530 2018-08-22 19:48:07 But it's not nearly to the same degree as fossil fuels, where one nation(Saudi Arabia) basically can control the oil market at will, and fortunately likes us because we kiss their ass even though they suck. Because oil.
2531 2018-08-22 19:47:54 Seems somewhat unlikely that the staple cooking oil of the longest-lived Indian state is "pure poison."
2532 2018-08-22 19:47:54 High school me woulda never pictured I’d be looking into Alberta oil field jobs now
2533 2018-08-22 19:47:50 You think that's bad, just wait until an oil tanker hits ground and spews oil into the pristine waterways of BC. It will happen with 3 to 7 times increase in tanker traffic. It's a #'s game
2534 2018-08-22 19:47:49 Can you tell why this murder matters more than the one in Colorado where a white guy killed two little girls put them in an oil tank and also killed their pregnant mother.
2535 2018-08-22 19:47:46 Wow this new face wash really sucked all the oil off of my skin. To the point where I felt the need to moisture right after ajskfl. Picking up good habits 
2536 2018-08-22 19:47:42 I agree. Ive actually used it to help tooth abcesses & its literally gotten rid of them, as well as preventative. Chemo & radiation has ruined my oral health, coco oil helps so much! I use to think that stuff was all made up but have come to realize its many benefits.
2537 2018-08-22 19:47:35 There are far more studies saying that coconut oil is bad for you than there are studies saying it’s good for you.
2538 2018-08-22 19:47:31 Maracuja triple phase oil from naturabrasil is my boyfriend.
2539 2018-08-22 19:47:29 Oil money
2540 2018-08-22 19:47:16 I know coconut oil is in the shortening & oil section of the store but I thought we were all just using it on our hair. I didn’t know people actually baked with it 
2541 2018-08-22 19:47:14 I bought a case so i can take my essential oil rollers on the plane with me but i decided i need a bigger case because i couldn’t decide which rollers i needed  so instead of 10 rollers I’ll be taking 14 
2542 2018-08-22 19:47:10 I honestly don’t know anyone who just eats coconut oil
2543 2018-08-22 19:47:08 Because Big Oil calls the shots.
2544 2018-08-22 19:47:06 Soy, corn and especially canola oil taste like garbage compared to coconut oil. Also, a lot of my dinner guests are allergic to soy & corn so I'm sticking with coconut and olive oils. It makes baked goods better too.
2545 2018-08-22 19:47:06 She has a point, but it has nothing to do with coconut oil itself. It's more how people use it. It has a low specific heat capacity so shouldn't ever be used to fry, sautee, or anything like that. It's best consumed raw or close to that.
2546 2018-08-22 19:47:03 This Murderer's Lawyer Richards is a Derp 

I however Love the Judge, She exposed this Lawyer's Snake Oil BS for the World to see on the Expanded Media, Stating she Personally called him over the E-File site being down...
2547 2018-08-22 19:46:55 QUAI DORLÉANS. 15 PLACE DU CARROUSEL
Felix Gonzalez-Tornero
Oil and teak plywood, hemp webbing, printed in color
2548 2018-08-22 19:46:54 ah no if I'm just pouring oil over the top I'll use black pepper and a sprinkle of cheese
2549 2018-08-22 19:46:53 I threw what was left of the coconut oil in the garbage.
2550 2018-08-22 19:46:41 Unfortunately there is very little actual information in the articles. Like what type of coconut oil does the prof. refer to? There is a lot of difference between cold-pressed / centrifuged virgin oil and a poor quality refined oil processed with chemicals.
2551 2018-08-22 19:46:35 Earth went trough a climate change many times before without the human influence. Yes we don't help raring millions of cows, still using oil for energy source cos it's cheaper the water so on but our impact is not the sole reason of the fires. And I know about the fires in US :(
2552 2018-08-22 19:46:34 If I were to sell some essential oil roller balls for $10-15 dollars/bottle, would anyone be interested? They would be doTERRA brand oils that I will dilute into the bottles.
2553 2018-08-22 19:46:30 Govt is scared of Italian mafia olive oil lobby 
2554 2018-08-22 19:46:19 The 1% are trying to dirty our water as much as they can so  we will have to buy clean bottled water from them! When we stop using oil they have to have something to replace it with! Water..we can't live without it!
2555 2018-08-22 19:46:18 bought some oil and my room smell good af. 
2556 2018-08-22 19:46:13 bought myself a facemask n new toner andtea tree oil  i love sales
2557 2018-08-22 19:46:09 Except she’s wrong Keto. MTC Oil (coconut oil)
2558 2018-08-22 19:46:09 I’d have to take a loan out to pay for all the oil they leak out 
2559 2018-08-22 19:45:56 I don't eat it, but it does fuck all for anything else. I can't use it on my skin. Pure coconut oil sets my skin on fire, and the main reason I got it was for Gabriel's wounds. But it doesn't help at all.
2560 2018-08-22 19:45:56 These folks make it sound like people drink an entire carton of coconut oil in one sitting. In moderation it's fine for seasoning and normal food cooking. Also it's such a dense source of energy that a small tiny portion once in a while with my morning coffee suppresses hunger.
2561 2018-08-22 19:45:54 I would hypothesize it is a long those same lines, that switching to coconut oil hope for a cure-all is easier for people than making the small changes necessary to a person diet.
2562 2018-08-22 19:45:51 Crude Oil Prices Settle at 2-Week Highs on Falling U.S. Crude Supplies
2563 2018-08-22 19:45:46 Rub,then marinate with lemon zest,herbs and olive oil.
2564 2018-08-22 19:45:38 Some grand lobby at work.

Usually such theories come up every few years and is later debunked by a bigger expert later on.
It is healthy food- we south Indians have used it for centuries in our cooking and as hair oil or moisturizer.
2565 2018-08-22 19:45:21 Before and after oil head massage 
2566 2018-08-22 19:45:20 Coconut oil is all of a sudden bad now that it’s gotten popular lmao
2567 2018-08-22 19:45:19 I've heard that with regards to nutrition information and education we're not much better than the dark ages. Personally we use a lot of coconut oil (and olive oil) in our house because I am allergic to soy and my son is allergic to dairy.
2568 2018-08-22 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2569 2018-08-22 19:45:05 They’re delicious sautéed with olive oil and garlic... try adding them to a grain bowl with quinoa or rice, lentils, and roasted winter squash! Yum!
2570 2018-08-22 19:45:04 Sometimes Twitter is really good. Not often, but sometimes.
2571 2018-08-22 19:45:03 One day you hear coconut oil is so healthy for your body, heart , etc. wouldn’t you think your stats were because of stupid news, ignorant experts! what’s next toout of our food..
2572 2018-08-22 19:45:03 Oil closing strong. New swings: $CEI $PED $GBR Old swing $TGC
2573 2018-08-22 19:45:02 @chevrolet tell customers it’s NOT 2 years of free maintenance it’s 2 free oil changes within 2 years big difference.
2574 2018-08-22 19:45:02 Imagine not knowing how to change you own breaks, oil.. etc life must be ruff
2575 2018-08-22 19:44:48 Apparently coconut oil is poison for the body
2576 2018-08-22 19:44:39 Ask him to explain the Oil revenue line.  He won't, because he knows it shows GERS up to be absolute rubbish.

I'd ask him myself but he just muted me instead after pointing out the GERS figures come from the UK government.
2577 2018-08-22 19:44:34 A tattoo artist ain't gon' be able to scare Olive Oil like no one will.
2578 2018-08-22 19:44:28 I loved our barter system! The brownies were ahhhmazzinng! Definitely need the recipe! Did you put coconut oil in them?
2579 2018-08-22 19:44:14 Lavender essential oil!
2580 2018-08-22 19:44:13 Be live at 10 today, be burning that midnight oil in minecraft.
2581 2018-08-22 19:44:07 Fucking amoxicillin ain’t doing shit. 
Sweet oil ain’t doing shit. 
Peroxide ain’t doing shit. 
Ibuprofen is about the only thing that’s helping do ANYTHING.
2582 2018-08-22 19:44:00 Also coconut  oil is a medium chain fatty acid.
2583 2018-08-22 19:43:54 Here's my verse for the day.

Proverbs 21:20 NASBS There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, But a foolish man swallows it up.
#Proverbs21_20
2584 2018-08-22 19:43:52 If in doubt, I’d bring it up.  I think there’s a big difference between smoking weed and using CBD oil in a medicinal environment. If you have concerns at all, talk with your bishop and explain. I agree, it’s much better than loading up on opioids… and probably is helping more!
2585 2018-08-22 19:43:46 A German banker, Matthias #Krull, pleaded guilty in Miami federal court on Wednesday to money laundering in a $1.2 billion case involving #Venezuelan businessmen. They allegedly embezzled funds from the state oil company, #PdVSA, on behalf of senior government officials.
2586 2018-08-22 19:43:44 Have you ever tried frying the sweet in chili oil? Little sea salt at the end...fucking
2587 2018-08-22 19:43:38 If one more person tells me my MS could be cured by coconut oil or cannabis or a drop of lavender in a gallon of water, I may explode!
2588 2018-08-22 19:43:32 i check my tire pressure, oil, and coolant before i ever drive my car. didn’t Mr.Boyer teach you anything?
2589 2018-08-22 19:43:26 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
2590 2018-08-22 19:43:24 Ever since I decided that I am actually going to move, I have been unusually calm... or maybe that's the CBD oil
2591 2018-08-22 19:43:21 Shea butter > coconut oil
2592 2018-08-22 19:43:20 then use red oil
2593 2018-08-22 19:43:10 All these studies are big business to market western wares. Now developing countries have become dumping ground for unhealthy processed food in supermarkets. I stick to mustard oil, butter, and ghee.
2594 2018-08-22 19:43:08 Get off the grid, go electric and force oil prices down.. any action to hit them where it hurts is better than none.
2595 2018-08-22 19:43:07 Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for near 50 years
and STILL managed to near bankrupt that oil rich UK.
So if not spent in London then where is it?
Is it any wonder the scots who see through the lies,which is over 50% now,want out of the union!
2596 2018-08-22 19:42:48 Everyone sells CBD oil these days.
2597 2018-08-22 19:42:46 Don't believe this.
We Indians have had coconut oil for many centuries and nothing has happened to us. 
For southen India (Kerala region) the land of Ayurveda, it is the base oil for most of the cooking. It is used by all daily as a hair oil and also is a great moisturizer.
2598 2018-08-22 19:42:39 Got my oil charge, eyebrows, and a pizza for free!! what a good ass day!
2599 2018-08-22 19:42:37 I have used cauliflower for years.  Try it with olive oil or grapeseed oil, cracked black pepper and sea salt.
2600 2018-08-22 19:42:36 Whose photo bombing who?
2601 2018-08-22 19:42:21 This is hyperinflation caused by US Sanctions & USA stopping Venezuela from selling oil on the open market. They now have to IMPORT oil from the USA. This is the deliberate destruction of Venezuela, by the USA.

2603 2018-08-22 19:42:01 Stop virtue signalling and do something about it @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland. Start with their oil exports to Canada.
2604 2018-08-22 19:41:52 Painting acrylic instead of oil requires so much damn patience & foresight like damn
2605 2018-08-22 19:41:40 I don’t use coconut oil for eating I use it for sex lol 
2606 2018-08-22 19:41:28 I did oil pulling with coconut oil for like a week once it was brutal

We’ll never know
2611 2018-08-22 19:41:12 Having had been in a tent that someone spilled the patchouli oil in, this book cover is 100% accurate.
2612 2018-08-22 19:41:06 Seb, oil prices are global, same for all.  If you argue that oil price change destroyed the industry, it would have had the same impact on all the other producers in the world.....it didn't.....there were other factors more important.

2621 2018-08-22 19:40:07 Family Nutrition: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this August? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
2622 2018-08-22 19:40:04 I've been putting coconut oil in my coffee for the past 3 years and cooking with it. I just got my blood work done and everything is perfect. No high blood pressure and heart disease runs in my family. Tell me again how I'm at risk for heart attack or stroke? 
2623 2018-08-22 19:40:03 Lovely! Maybe the colour is oil slick?
2624 2018-08-22 19:39:56 I’ve had the fire of the anointing oil burning like an inferno inside me for 19 years so I am not surprised one bit to see this same fire be poured upon the entire world for refinement.  #Kingdom

2628 2018-08-22 19:39:37 each evening I drizzle olive oil from the grove of the family of a one time lover of my lover, it tastes good
2629 2018-08-22 19:39:33 Unfortunately it doesn't say anything about what type of coconut oil the prof. refers to. There is a big difference between cold-pressed / centrifuged virgin oil and a poor quality refined oil processed with chemicals and artificial flavoring.

2634 2018-08-22 19:39:20 I do t know what this person based the conclusion on but in South India people are eating coconut oil and Coconut for centuries and most of them are pretty slim and intelligent.  Just Saying..
2635 2018-08-22 19:39:20 I knew it. I was eating so much coconut oil last year my cholesterol went through the roof. I couldn’t explain why maybe coconut oil was the culprit.
2636 2018-08-22 19:39:19 Your government worked out an agreement to sell military arms to the Saudis and gave away the CWB to the Saudis. Funny how you want energy independence but not food independence. News flash: we can’t eat oil. #cdnpoli #medhat
2637 2018-08-22 19:39:07 Lmao y’all did it again. Coconut oil isn’t for eating hahaha
2638 2018-08-22 19:39:07 Hello..in 2014 i had 2nd stage lymph node tumours in my face and neck...i ate oil twice a day .size of a grain of rice..
After 8mnths of digesting it.the tumours changed shapes until they disappeared..i also added oil to cocobutter cream rubbed into areas..

2640 2018-08-22 19:39:01 The claim that all saturated fats are bad is wonky science that too many industries are built on to debunk. I hate to see things like this because coconut oil is demonstrably not a dangerous food.
2641 2018-08-22 19:39:00 Horrible
I will look into it.
But what are alternatives? I dont know what else to take to sleep besides what i already use (thc pure oil, seroquel not for psychosis but for sleep also) so what can i do i need sleep? I have difficult sleep disorder but i dont want other issues
2642 2018-08-22 19:38:57 Hi. Trinidad and Tobago looking for financing in their oil/gas production ? Can we talk in pm?
2643 2018-08-22 19:38:57 When I saw a nutritionist in the 80s, coconut oil was the worst. Then it became a super healthy food. Now it's the worst again. It's like eggs all over again.
2644 2018-08-22 19:38:57 Norway in addition to high taxes has huge oil reserves and monstrous sovereign wealth fund. So even if we tap all our "resources" we will still fall behind.

2646 2018-08-22 19:38:48 i use hair masks, shampoo and conditioner for extra nourishment and conditioning, argan oil everyday, coconut oil serum everyday, and olive oil treatment every other week /:
2647 2018-08-22 19:38:38 This is true, but coconut oil contains a lot of saturated fat in comparison to olive oil and sunflower oil. Making it unhealthy to cook with too.
2648 2018-08-22 19:38:31 My beard smells like coconut oil
2649 2018-08-22 19:38:30 Lmao who’s eating coconut oil though

2655 2018-08-22 19:37:47 More excited than I should be that the health benefits of coconut oil have been totally debunked. I do love it when a so-called superfood gets the heave-ho. What a load of toot.
2656 2018-08-22 19:37:43 At Discount Tire waiting for my new set to be put on... Man look shout out to the team here, construction, oil field, welding, and anywhere else that deals with working in this Texas heat!
2657 2018-08-22 19:37:38 What’s interesting is SW purse was found on kitchen counter, luggage at bottom of steps upstairs and this—her phone was stuck in a sofa cushion downstairs. Her plane was late, so I bet he ambushed her downstairs. I believe the children were already dead and in the oil barrel.
2658 2018-08-22 19:37:34 Smells like oil

2663 2018-08-22 19:37:15 Got the go ahead from pain management to use CBD oil, anyone have any recommendations for online retailers?  Amazon doesn't sell it.
2664 2018-08-22 19:37:11 More lies! oil prices have been high for over a year now, plus you have collected 50 Naira Stamp Duty for every significant financial transaction since 2015. Your government had more than enough resources yet it has frittered it tenure. Gerraway joor!
2665 2018-08-22 19:36:58 I posted this as a comment on Leonardo DiCaprio's page on a teeet about standing up to big oil. We should ask these people who we know are emotionally invested in aiding Humanity. So I did....
2666 2018-08-22 19:36:44 Palm oil will never be acceptable wether it good or bad for us,because it’ll never be good for the wildlife
2667 2018-08-22 19:36:44 There are other options such as the feds paying some of the cost, they are on the hook for almost half if we default, they can also use and additional revenue from oil, they can cut salaries of CEOs and executives of crown corporations, agencies and boards and also they can 1/
2668 2018-08-22 19:36:40 Well said. I fell for the CBD (snake oil) shenanigans. Wasted time and $.

2670 2018-08-22 19:36:34 I hate humans for destroying their habitats for Palm Oil and the like, and don’t anybody come back at me with they should be allowed to develop their own land in whichever way they feel because NO they shouldn’t we all need to look after this place as we only have one 
2671 2018-08-22 19:36:20 It baffles me hearing any of this. I used to lather my entire body in straight up virgin coconut oil and take raw virgin coconut oil baths i had no idea it was bad

2677 2018-08-22 19:35:54 Why the salad hatred?

Fresh tomatoes from the garden, chopped, add chiffonade of fresh basil, crumble on some feta, toss in some toasted sunflower seeds, dress with balsamic vinegar, dijon, garlic, lemon juice & extra virgin olive oil.

Feeling adventurous? Add some watermelon.
2678 2018-08-22 19:35:53 Brought Kami’s car for an oil change and I told them I just wanted to get in and out without all the extra checks and stuff. The guy responded “it won’t make it cheaper”

2686 2018-08-22 19:35:03 hmmmm I'm interested to see who did this study or came to this conclusion because most of the paleo/keto/autoimmune world seems to think coconut oil is good for you or at least fine in moderation as a healthy fat
2687 2018-08-22 19:34:57 $71.39 for an Oil change.. lmao next time I’m running this truck dry..

2709 2018-08-22 19:32:55 Also, I’d like to ask, who “eats” coconut oil, though? Like, I get using it as a cooking oil or, like what I did then, have a small amount of it...but to actually “eat” it? Come on. Of course that’ll kill you. You’re consuming oil. 
2710 2018-08-22 19:32:54 Did you rubbing a neutral oil on the glue with your finger? Like grapeseed or even olive oil?
2711 2018-08-22 19:32:46 no one's getting away from big oil, the real world is hooked on it. all you're doing is making Saudi oil worth more......They just executed the first female for speaking out against their human rights record. and you're protest helps them with that. #YoureNotAFeministITakeIt

2715 2018-08-22 19:32:24 It's not hard. You just keep adding olive oil.
2716 2018-08-22 19:32:16 Interesting, I'd love to see how it all looks at the end. Did you end up giving the figs a bath first? I've heard of some stickers peeling, even the Repro ones on some of the figures from excess oil/mould release.

2730 2018-08-22 19:30:52 That’s not correct. But corn/vegetable oil IS bad. Avocado, olive & coconut oil however IS good for you. 
Coconut/Avocado contain good fats that help your body. 
Then there are also good oils to use topically.
2731 2018-08-22 19:30:42 Whyyyyyyy would you feed a dog oil Gah????

2733 2018-08-22 19:30:38 Kitava is one of the islands of Papua New Guinea. Its inhabitants’ diets consisted of starch, fruit, coconut, and fish, and they were in excellent health.

The brand of coconut oil shouldn’t matter too much, I prefer the refined stuff to virgin because it has no coconut flavor.

2735 2018-08-22 19:30:22 Dangote fought that quota, Ibeto stopped operation completely at some point and laid off workers. There will be no need for ban if there are more local manufacturers or refineries as in the case of oil, it will push the price down but not when there's only one manufacturer.
2736 2018-08-22 19:30:16 You are aware that the Bolivar crisis has nothing to do with giving away oil proceeds "for free"?
2737 2018-08-22 19:30:16 That’s really funny because I had a brain injury and I’m a big let food be thy medicine person. So many Dr said coconut oil !!! But I’m allergic to coconut so I said I couldn’t do it! Saved by science and allergies
2738 2018-08-22 19:30:12 Thank God he didn't dent your glow with that kings vegetable oil.
2739 2018-08-22 19:30:09 It's a pity that the professor doesn't mention what type of coconut oil she refers to. There is quite a difference between cold-pressed / centrifuged virgin oil and a poor quality refined oil using chemicals and artificial flavoring.
2740 2018-08-22 19:30:03 THREE AND A HALF HOURS TO CHANGE MY OIL LMAO FUCKING DUMBASSES IT TAKES ME 20 MINUTES TO CHANGE OIL YOU FUCKING IMBECILES OH MY GOD
IT TAKES ANOTHER HOUR TO CHANGE MY FUCKING TIRES
2741 2018-08-22 19:30:01 Drilling was completed on the first productive commercial oil well in Titusville, PA, on August 27, 1859.

2744 2018-08-22 19:29:58 I was about to comment something similar. When I was a kid in the Philippines, I would have a tbsp of coconut oil after breakfast & after dinner. It actually helped with my metabolism & helped me lose a little bit of weight (I got *pretty* chubby when I was a kid). So yeah.
2745 2018-08-22 19:29:56 I finished my bottle of castor oil today and now I must find money to buy another bottle
2746 2018-08-22 19:29:52 The EPA released a plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan. This was put in place to save American lives from not only the deadly toxins produced in burning coal, oil, and gas, but to also save lives from the devastating effects of a changing climate. We have to stop this madness.
2747 2018-08-22 19:29:40 They can tell us how a small country with more oil than Norway and a plethora of other assets,  resources & exports is uniquely an economic basket case without support from the broad shoulders of the UKs £2trillion toxic black hole
2748 2018-08-22 19:29:37 Wait... There's ice on the moon? Coconut oil isn't good for you? WHAT ELSE AREN'T THEY TELLING US?
2749 2018-08-22 19:29:19 Scottie poured oil in the kitchen I wonder if some of it got in the oven lol
2750 2018-08-22 19:29:16 Oh boy oil light is acting funky so I just called it Bayonetta Shotput.
2751 2018-08-22 19:29:14 It became a problem because these lot started adding coconut oil to things it didn’t belong in. Like coffee, they’re even adding turmeric to sweet dishes, once they discover something they abuse it until it becomes unhealthy
2752 2018-08-22 19:29:11 It's a pity that the professor doesn't mention what type of coconut oil she refers to. There is quite a difference between cold-pressed / centrifuged virgin oil and a poor quality refined oil using chemicals and artificial flavoring.
2753 2018-08-22 19:29:09 Reeeeally? I had no idea! I mean I eat on the healthy ish side too but I can’t recall a recipe listing coconut oil specifically.
2754 2018-08-22 19:29:08 Another snake oil salesman
2755 2018-08-22 19:29:02 My comment was about cities. Without cities reducing their oil use there will be less to go around for regional areas that need fuel in a fuel shortage. There is no effort by lib or alp govts to force oil coys to hold more fuel to meet 90 day IEA requirements.
2756 2018-08-22 19:29:00 White people. Who the fuck eats coconut oil  is Africans don’t even do that shit

2760 2018-08-22 19:28:48 What about that thing where people put coconut oil in their mouths and hold it there for 20 minutes? Oil pulling? Blech
2761 2018-08-22 19:28:48 Hold on to your truck load of #coconut oil,I bet in a few months or weeks even they will be telling us to use it by the truckload,because of its huge beneficial health benefits.
2762 2018-08-22 19:28:39 A well known NGO boards an oil rig to make a point. They send senior people. They get away with it. Great #PR. They do it again a few months later. Special forces were in place. They sent v young and inexperienced kids. Very nasty. Who’s in the right and wrong? #powerandinfluence
2763 2018-08-22 19:28:39 There won't be another stream tonight. Got another dose of Olive Oil and Cotton Wool in my ear, and I have a headache coming.
2764 2018-08-22 19:28:35 Did you hear about the guy that killed his pregnant wife and two daughters and hid them in oil tanks ???  . A US citizen committed these crimes. Where is your outrage ???  Or do crimes by only certain people bother you ???
2765 2018-08-22 19:28:23 If "crude and unrefined" is in reference to when oil leaked into Cleveland's water and the river was set on fire, I take great, great offense
2766 2018-08-22 19:28:18 climate change increases exponentially. each year, or month, or whatever, doubles the urgency of putting oil companies out of business.
2767 2018-08-22 19:28:17 Six appliances in attendance at an oil refinery employing nine hundred people. Seven appliances at an uninhabited phone phone shop with a bit of wacky baccy growing upstairs in Caernarfon. You can just imagine thirty odd firefighters in that little space.

Trump lies, and doesn't present the person of character we'd all like to see in the WH. But Obama, as slick as snake oil, lied as much or more, and used the gov. against his own citizens 1
2771 2018-08-22 19:28:00 Kitava? What brand of coconut oil do your recommend?
2772 2018-08-22 19:28:00 Payment went to Avanti I promise.
2773 2018-08-22 19:27:57 Oh wow another “Emily” that is pushing the same snake oil product. My day just is t complete without this clogging up my time line.
2774 2018-08-22 19:27:55 I know right?  Until they strangle their pregnant wife and 2 little daughters. And bury them in oil tankers.
2775 2018-08-22 19:27:53 as a remain voter I needed to know what difference #EU has meant to ordinary people. funnily membership hasn't stopped the 70's Oil crisis, 80's Thatcher recession or 90's Majors black Wednesday, the 2008 banking crisis & now British people in debt for living & #foodbanks #Brexit
2776 2018-08-22 19:27:51 trying something different - made fresh batch of pesto - freezing spoonfuls in ice cube tray, covered with olive oil. Saw it in magazine. check back if interested in how it worked

2778 2018-08-22 19:27:44 Ooh, how lovely! Maybe a bit of slow roasting with olive oil is what you need? Did you grow them in a greenhouse?

2781 2018-08-22 19:27:36 No way! That pic shows all the daily A's B's C's D's and E's of the vitamin landscape. That's more like a capsule of fish oil there.
2782 2018-08-22 19:27:33 Who told the whyte forks eat coconut oil?!
2783 2018-08-22 19:27:32 Onunu with fresh fish palm oil stew
2784 2018-08-22 19:27:30 @GaramDharam_GD  Normal water you are providing is not pure and contains some sort of oil in it. I visited there 2nd time but unfortunately both the times I found small stones in parathas n other food. Totally unstatisfied.
2785 2018-08-22 19:27:20 Olive oil or nothing.
2786 2018-08-22 19:27:19 Mfer begging for some oil. Lmaooo.
2787 2018-08-22 19:27:17 No one I know cooks with coconut oil for health benefits. They use it because they like how it makes food taste. They won’t stop using it just because an unhealthy looking doctor says it’s bad.
2788 2018-08-22 19:27:12 BREAKING NEWS: Coconut oil is pure poison. 
#WednesdayWisdom #SayNoToCoCo
2789 2018-08-22 19:27:09 I like cooking with coconut oil bc it tastes better I'm not worried about which oil is worse for me
2790 2018-08-22 19:27:09 The place where i usually get the car's oil change had a full turnover of staff.  Should have been a warning.  The business used to not try to pressure you with an aggressive upsell tactic.  They pulled that stunt today.  And now they've lost a long time customer.
2791 2018-08-22 19:27:09 I get a kick out of these dimms. They talk about Cohen and Manifort 24×7. They ignore everything else like ILLEGALS killing American citizens. NOKO, Saudi Oil deals, Europe implosion. They completely ignore democratic race baiters and tax dodgers owing more than 4 million in tax.

2793 2018-08-22 19:27:09 So now coconut oil is a problem?
2794 2018-08-22 19:27:06 Tea tree oil
2795 2018-08-22 19:27:04 Coconut oil is poison now? Tell that to all of the melanin goddesses who bathe in it. Black women swear by it.
2796 2018-08-22 19:27:04 My ancestors in Kerala cooked everything in coconut oil, they lived to be in their nineties. I think it is good for health but they wouldn’t have put it in a coffee and neither would I but my friends seem to be doing very well using coconut milk in coffee
2797 2018-08-22 19:27:03 Very true. It all depends on the type of coconut oil.
2798 2018-08-22 19:27:00 a couple years ago there were banks lining up to give the saudi gov a $10 billion line of credit with nothing behind it. and oil prices were $30 a barrel.
2799 2018-08-22 19:26:56 hey! FUCK YOU! i love my coconut oil and my hair loves it too!
2800 2018-08-22 19:26:53 White guy who killed his pregnant wife and seems to have strangled his young daughters before submerging them in oil. What was his family background? I can’t recall...
2801 2018-08-22 19:26:41 Colloidal silver, chaparral, oregano oil and cats claw are quite effective for me. Also, you could try ranitidine for possible quick relief. Best wishes
2802 2018-08-22 19:26:28 How about the American who killed his pregnant wife and strangled his 2 children and put them in oil, did they check his background too.
2803 2018-08-22 19:26:20 Yep, valuation, proven reserves and human rights issues. Also, looks like oil price is heading South. Good for consumers, bad for oil backed dictatorships.
2804 2018-08-22 19:26:18 Come on bro we kannadiga don't use coconut oil for cooking.

2806 2018-08-22 19:26:03 No but you should use butter as your main fat source for ketogenic diets since most oils (olive/coconut oil ect.) create bad free radicals at a high temps. It's a bit more sciencey but do some research on it...Unless you want to eat raw scoops of coconut oil for the benefit
2807 2018-08-22 19:26:01 It all depends on the type of coconut oil. There is very good quality and some very bad quality that has been processed with chemicals and artificial flavoring.
2808 2018-08-22 19:25:24 Don't just like it! Give us an emoji and we will give you $2.00 off your purchase of one of these! First it's a candle, then it's a massage oil! — excited
2809 2018-08-22 19:25:23 Coconut oil is pure poison? Does the professor had ever heard some illness can healed by coconut oil? 
This is professor from Harvard?
2810 2018-08-22 19:25:23 No shit it’s going to be bad for you to some extent. It’s fatty oil and like every other food item out there moderation is key in order to enjoy them.
2811 2018-08-22 19:25:19 In Colorado, a white just killed two little girls put them in an oil tank he also killed a pregnant woman. Does that matter too? We know it doesn't matter to you guys because the killer is a white American man.
2812 2018-08-22 19:25:13 Why is oil pushing $70 again? 
OPEC & Russia collude in plain sight to keep prices high, that's why!!
Why does the U.S. play along, at the expense of U.S. consumers, when it can wrestle control away from the greedy CARTEL to drive prices down to $40 or $30?

2815 2018-08-22 19:25:01 Inevitable given rising Chinese and de facto Russian influence over Eurasia. US policy of controlling Middle Eastern oil hasn't changed. Ergo, hegemony was lost in the last two decades by the US bingeing on Chinese labour. US financial hegemony was therefore always an illusion.

2819 2018-08-22 19:24:56 All these people shocked that coconut oil is bad for you.. it’s just saturated fat.. like how did you think that was good for you?? 
2820 2018-08-22 19:24:52 and in Saudia Arabia (an supplier of oil to basically everyone but Israel) they're just NOW letting women drive at all..  meanwhile, we have female arab judges/ etc etc
2821 2018-08-22 19:24:48 Lesson learned: falafel is not as tasty when baked.. I should’ve fried it like a normal person. I’m not even trying to be healthy I just hate frying things cause of the oil splattering
2822 2018-08-22 19:24:39 Thats why i take fish oil
2823 2018-08-22 19:24:38 I think moderation with especially saturated fats in general is probably a good idea.

But what coconut oil *is* good for is treating thrush and other illnesses caused by yeast.  Works even better than nystatin.
2824 2018-08-22 19:24:26 This sounds like propaganda from #AnimalAgriculture! I eat coconut oil daily. Vegan 14+ years. My annual blood work all comes back not just good, but STELLAR. When she complains that ‘it has no cholestrol so it’s not that great for you...’ That’s how you know it’s from animal ag!
2825 2018-08-22 19:24:23 I’m sorry I’ve been using MCT oil in my bulletproof coffee for 18 months now and my blood numbers have never been better my cholesterol is completely normal my blood pressure is perfect I have greater focus ...debunk that. 62 yrs old...I take no medicine
2826 2018-08-22 19:24:22 What about the coal industry deregulating the industries emissions to be allowed to pour toxins into the air, lakes, and streams in America ? This s one of the things Scott Pruitt deregulated for his coal baron friends—why continue to desire to deregulate oil, gas, coal, carbons?
2827 2018-08-22 19:24:18 DHS actively adjudicates the immigration status of individuals incarcerated in the Texas prison system. At this time, more than 25,000 incarcerated individuals have been identified as being in the country illegally, 10,182 of which were not identified through the PEP program
2828 2018-08-22 19:24:15 To be able to answer this it's important to understand that there are different types of coconut oil ranging from very healthy (virgin, cold-pressed etc) to very bad quality. (some chemically processed refined oils)
2829 2018-08-22 19:24:11 Coconut oil is solid. Why would you think that’s healthy to ingest in the first place .

2832 2018-08-22 19:24:06 Add a bottle of Castor oil
2833 2018-08-22 19:24:00 To protect UK interests in Iranian oil and prevent any possibility of #Iran becoming a Soviet ally, on this day in 1953 the joint CIA MI6 'Operation Ajax' overthrew Iran's democratically elected leader, ushering in 25 years of US UK backed dictatorship
2834 2018-08-22 19:23:48 a couple weeks ago I ordered an oil pan and some gaskets online that ended up not being for my car. I just started the return process and they just want pictures that I received them, but not send them back???? THEY ARE UNOPENED??
2835 2018-08-22 19:23:35 The public doesn't want to pay for it in higher energy prices though. Public support for a lot of good things is strong if it doesn't cost voters any money. Make oil revenues a significant part of the budget and incentives change drastically.
2836 2018-08-22 19:23:32 Haha, my people used coconut oil for 1000s of years.  If my people have heart issues its because of a sedentary lifestyle.  This might play a factor but i have to see the lab reports and how the experiments were done (controlled lab rats), otherwise this is unfounded.
2837 2018-08-22 19:23:32 probably the reason is because in the old days crude oil was not invented yet. and ghee & other veg oil is also flammable. or you may be right too.
2838 2018-08-22 19:23:12 Werd is that coconut oil is bad for you now??? 
2839 2018-08-22 19:23:02 Didn’t they say canola oil is bad too?
2840 2018-08-22 19:22:58 Never hopped on the eat more coconut oil bandwagon;Oil is oil.... avoid consumption but it’s still great for hair and skin.

2845 2018-08-22 19:22:38 I thought it was common knowledge that coconut oil was a saturated fat (unusual for a vegetable oil), but then so many of my friends started using it in all their cooking. A crazy fad.
Olive oil has known health benefits. Love coconut milk/cream in Thai curries and laksa.

2854 2018-08-22 19:22:15 There are so many other fattening foods, other than coconut oil. In fact, fat may be the only negative aspect of coconut oil! If you want to talk poison, mention canola oil.
2855 2018-08-22 19:22:13 I am 47, not overweight and suffer from high cholesterol.  Should I stay away from coconut oil?  Not trolling.  Seriously value your opinion.  Thanks.
2856 2018-08-22 19:22:11 I think he was going about it all wrong, but yeah, renewables are going to be the future. I just don't see a petrostate like Norway being too eager to lose their cash cow. And our incentives would change under government ownership of oil resources as well.

2860 2018-08-22 19:21:44 Texas. Between June 1, 2011 and July 31, 2018, these 175,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 273,000 criminal offenses which included arrests for 505 homicide charges; 30,408 assault charges; 5,396 burglary charges; 34,555 drug charges; 365 kidnapping charges;
2861 2018-08-22 19:21:30 Change the oil in your car. Today. Do it. Cars don't have kidneys. They depend on us to perform their needed dialysis. #WednesdayWisdom
2862 2018-08-22 19:21:14 His oil money & drug money are kept with NK & Mianmar Junta.
2863 2018-08-22 19:21:14 Lol. Even if i did, after my proposals to legalise cannabis + hemp oil, ban all gm foods and pump more money into schools and th nhs amongst other things, id probably be found dead with a suicide note and load of filth on my pc. Nooooo fank yoo!
2864 2018-08-22 19:21:05 I was taking off my makeup and I shoved some almond oil in my eye and it won't stop watering tou like kya scene hai
2865 2018-08-22 19:21:05 Scotland / UK has £0 in an oil fund. Norway has £1 trillion. I think the oil produced over the last 40 years is a bit more equal than that
2866 2018-08-22 19:20:54 Which oil is loosing it's money now and needs to be promoted? 
Or is it some big share holder playing his/her new set of cards 
I wonder 
2867 2018-08-22 19:20:43 I imagine this the list eyathunyelwa abasekhaya yezinto ukuthi bachecke umalayitsha engafika:

2868 2018-08-22 19:20:43 i will deadass commision an oil painting of young thug fixing that models attire on the runway
2869 2018-08-22 19:20:41 oddly enough it seems my car overheating has corrected it's oil consumption problems
2870 2018-08-22 19:20:36 FUCK BLUNTS IM GOING TO START INVESTING IN OIL PENS HOW MUCH THEM CARTRIDGES LAST ??????
2871 2018-08-22 19:20:36 Coconut oil is #BlackGirlMagic culture.
2872 2018-08-22 19:20:32 yes, a good president in Cameroon can easily double salaries!! Billions upon billions are unaccounted for by biya and cohorts!! Revenue from the oil sector e.g. is really known only by biya, his cohorts, france. Do most of these cohorts even pay taxes in their businesses?
2873 2018-08-22 19:20:24 A senior exec in an oil company once said to me there were three reasons why you chose to buy your fuel where you did: location, location, location.
2874 2018-08-22 19:20:23 Ever wonder why oil is on the top of the food pyramid?
2875 2018-08-22 19:20:17 Oil prices have gone up again .will push petrol prices further up. Crucial Elections coming !
2876 2018-08-22 19:20:11 i’m so happy science is coming for coconut oil i hope it buries that devil juice in the ground where it belongs
2877 2018-08-22 19:20:10 The UK did not intervene with Yemen so why would they care about a female activist. Where there is oil there is power. It is as simple as that. UK will never stand up to allies who do wrong. I mean Israel is the perfect example.
2878 2018-08-22 19:20:08 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse   If they want a “wall” to protect them then let the oil companies pay for it with the HUGE subsidies they get from the American people - any foreign entity can pay for their own protection as we owe them nothing
2879 2018-08-22 19:20:08 I love cooking Canadian food, but adding flavour.

Mac & Cheese? BAM! Seasoning.

Meat pie? THWACK! Olive oil.

Caesar salad? JABOOSH! Right in the garbage.
2880 2018-08-22 19:20:04 Yep, just like snake oil back in the day
2881 2018-08-22 19:19:59 So please make sure you vote "NO" on Kavenaugh! You know he will back corporate oil industries and continue to support the dismantling of the EPA.
2882 2018-08-22 19:19:55 Wasu ma sai gobe za a yi yankan
2883 2018-08-22 19:19:38 The whole issue of Palm oil is a mess. Layer upon layer of complexity and bureaucracy. Ridiculous.
2884 2018-08-22 19:19:19 Will you also discuss the US citizen that killed his pregnant wife and children and buried them in an oil barrel? Is one better than the other, or just looks different?
2885 2018-08-22 19:19:15 Oil has never been good for you.
2886 2018-08-22 19:19:14 We are slowly loosing our culture as Africans. I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating KDF instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
2887 2018-08-22 19:19:06 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
2888 2018-08-22 19:19:04 With a note: "Obama was too much of a ----- to use coconut oil. Only a real man has the balls to do it. Repeat -- Obama was too scared!!"
2889 2018-08-22 19:19:02 Coconut oil is pure poison in the sense of the way it’s marketed- at the end of the day it’s a oil which is a fat yet Americans have this belief that coconut oil is super healthy
2890 2018-08-22 19:18:57 Lawsuit against U.S. coast guard over oil spill emergency preparedness in the Great Lakes filed today by two Enviro Groups. The Lawsuit claims Coast Guard failed to comply with Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Details to come
2891 2018-08-22 19:18:51 We should reopen the sarnia refinery and use our oil rather than selling it... With some luck we will have enough pot that we can all stay high till oct 2019 when the Conservatives roll in

2893 2018-08-22 19:18:47 She hasn’t “debunked” anything. She simply gave her opinion, which because she’s a Harvard Professor seems like she must be correct. Nope. On Keto Coconut Oil is a staple...and clearly it doesn’t make them/us fat.
2894 2018-08-22 19:18:38 LAST NIGHT...for the S&W (Signs & Wonders) Conference, it's an Oil Anointing Servive.  Jabez will be performing! You can always watch LIVE on ustream if you cant be there in person
2895 2018-08-22 19:18:34 what kind of oil do u use to season it?
2896 2018-08-22 19:18:32 Only semi-magic oil is Argan, and they are determined to waste the lot on body products vs keeping a sensible division to allow it to flourish in the culinary landscape. That and, well, Big Oil(s) has been at it ever since scaring people on all direct animal fats, then butter, et
2897 2018-08-22 19:18:27 Um, Trump is on his way out and those who supported the seller of poison snake oil will never be credible again.

2898 2018-08-22 19:18:25 my cholesterol @showed good on vegan diet also inclusive of moderate coconut oil use.
2899 2018-08-22 19:18:22 I can smell the castor oil
2900 2018-08-22 19:18:19 Most middle eastern muslim communities are victims of #Oil greedy west and invader #israel.
And most recently #obamas #iran deal 

#Christianity lost to #atheism long ago....
2901 2018-08-22 19:18:05 Welp let me toss my coconut oil.
2902 2018-08-22 19:18:05 anyway theres a man named JEFF downstairs laying the PIPE (fixing the oil unit thing) and my dog, Girl, was just attacking him but he's fucking HARD bc he didn't leave or anything he took it like a MAN lets all SUCK jeff's TOOLS
2903 2018-08-22 19:17:58 I find it funny that coconut oil is horrible for you because it's one of those things ONE person said was good for you and everyone hopped on the train and praised it without doing any research.
2904 2018-08-22 19:17:42 How deep in the pockets of the auto and oil industries does a person need to be to think this is necessary?
2905 2018-08-22 19:17:41 Kata gila nanti marah. Ko tahu x Indonesia tu world largest palm oil producers? And before this atok pergi china pun. Mmg china da amik palm oil drpd Indonesia. Stupid jerk like pogba

2910 2018-08-22 19:17:35 That’s stated in the article. There’s no correlation with their health and coconut oil exclusively. It could be from their actually healthy diet.
2911 2018-08-22 19:17:31 Nymex Settles 8/22/18 - CL Oct18: 67.86 (+2.02) (+5.3% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2912 2018-08-22 19:17:30 Unfortunately the article doesn't state anything about what the professor bases her findings on nor what kind of coconut oil this applies to. There is quite a difference in quality between different oils.
2913 2018-08-22 19:17:26 Of all of the spider  treatment advice I’ve tried (pros included) I think peppermint oil has worked the best 
2914 2018-08-22 19:17:25 For future reference, Don't get tea tree oil in your eye. It doesn't feel good
2915 2018-08-22 19:17:16 The rain finish me for oil mill
2916 2018-08-22 19:17:08 Even American environmentalists want both cheap oil, and less oil, which doesn't really work. In order for us to drill less, prices have to go up and then demand has to fall.
2917 2018-08-22 19:17:07 Beard oil is typically not used to promote follicle growth, and those that claim that are selling you snake oil.

Be sure to have a good diet, exercise (exercise boosts testosterone which in turn can lead to facial hair stimulus), and be patient.
2918 2018-08-22 19:17:00 Okay I black out when I get angry too but I’m not out here killing college girls going on jogs.. I also would get upset if I saw my significant other killing my child but I wouldn’t put my children in an oil tank

These excuses aren’t even clever. Gross.
2919 2018-08-22 19:16:55 Your once great profession has been reduced to snake oil & used car salesmen. You've all been caught lying too many times for anyone to believe your garbage other than sheep. But good job on the "scoop". No video, it didnt happen.
2920 2018-08-22 19:16:37 I just made some fresh red pepper steak stir fry with a curry rice pilaf for my son and now I want to eat it but I only cooked enough for him.... Now the house smells like sesame oil and spices, so I can't lie and say that I didn't make it.....
2921 2018-08-22 19:16:36 Seriously who though it was ever good for you? It's COCONUT OIL.
2922 2018-08-22 19:16:27 We are literally the only country on Earth where there are citizens calling for us to voluntarily reduce oil production. Most other countries recognize that you have to reach the demand end, by taxing oil usage heavily. Americans are too immature though.
2923 2018-08-22 19:16:20 When you let him drive and he asks “Babe you know your oil/tire light is on?” 
2924 2018-08-22 19:16:05 FU big oil
2925 2018-08-22 19:15:51 Hi! Suncor, the proud owner of Petro-Canada, is a Canadian company. The vast majority of the oil that makes up our refined products originates from Western Canada (primarily oil sands). We also source crude oil from the east coast off Newfoundland & occasionally the North Sea.
2926 2018-08-22 19:15:48 Well I guess canola oil is supposed to be healthy?  I’ll pass!
2927 2018-08-22 19:15:47 So quit toying with the bring down Trump coalition and deal them the death blow. 
Biggest mistake IMO was saying the Clintons were " good people" and he didnt want to cause them problems.  Should have gone after them hard. They aren't holding back.
2928 2018-08-22 19:15:44 Use mpl oil dear
2929 2018-08-22 19:15:41 What about the £32 Billion of Oil revenue that is accounted to “other Countries” because it’s not sent ashore to Scotland.
2930 2018-08-22 19:15:37 But the attempt to front-load oil revenues to finance decisive diversification away from oil remains important. For that reason I’d expect more bond issues. And it’s not an unreasonable policy (if implemented well, which so far it hasn’t been).
2931 2018-08-22 19:15:37 Don't use this as political propaganda! What about the beautiful American  pregnant wife/mom & two children who were killed by their legal American citizen husband/father dumping the children in an oil well? Let Mollie's family  grieve in peace!
2932 2018-08-22 19:15:30 I think it depends on what exactly is being harmed. If the US government drove some natives off their land to get at their oil, that might cause a public backlash. But we're not going to turn down money today because of climate change tomorrow.
2933 2018-08-22 19:15:30 I can't put coconut oil on my hair neither
2934 2018-08-22 19:15:22 Ever heard of #climatechange? Dead right were going to be "shafted" if we carry on burning oil like there's no tomorrow.
2935 2018-08-22 19:15:22 I constantly taken these drugs to heal my pain. When drank oil i forget about everything.
2936 2018-08-22 19:15:21 Not sure why I continue coming to World Car Kia in New Braunfels to have my car serviced. Each time has been awful. They lost my appointment then proceeded to take THREE HOURS TO DO ROUTINE SERVICE (oil change & tire rotation).
2937 2018-08-22 19:15:09 now that is healthy. also canola... it's high in omega-3 (the good fat) and doesn't break down and become more saturated over high heat (ie sauteing with olive oil is ok, frying is not).
2938 2018-08-22 19:15:09 Oil stocks to watch for tomorrow: $PED $GBR $TGC $SAEX
2939 2018-08-22 19:15:08 No more coconut oil for me
2940 2018-08-22 19:14:59 First of all what dumbass cooks with or eats coconut oil
2941 2018-08-22 19:14:45 Nahhh, I’m fine with my coconut oil
2942 2018-08-22 19:14:32 DPF doesn’t burn properly due to lack of heat, (poor design) thus tries to burn more often. Thus means more diesel goes in oil because of many failed burns.More diesel in sump oil, means poor quality lubrication.
Balance shafts turn at 2x speed of the crank , balance shafts fail
2943 2018-08-22 19:14:32 We have the tech to make Salt Water into Fresh water, & we pipe oil for 1000 of miles, why not water.
2944 2018-08-22 19:14:07 SANA OIL LOVE ANO HAHHAHAHAH
2945 2018-08-22 19:14:00 Heeey , I check my oil daaamit .
2946 2018-08-22 19:13:58 Day 234: Go ahead and eat dessert. Don’t text them back. Use coconut oil. #365positivity #positivitweet
2947 2018-08-22 19:13:57 OMG!!! IT'S THE BEST ON PIZZA!!! Be daring & splash a little chili oil on it. 
2948 2018-08-22 19:13:44 I’ve been to her show. Appreciated her photos for some years! She died too young 
2949 2018-08-22 19:13:43 Harper allowed companies to abuse the temporary foreign worker program even during the recession. Oil workers couldn’t even get a job at McDonalds. He allowed Somali refugees to cross the border and stay. One of which did the van attack in Edmonton.
2950 2018-08-22 19:13:39 Why one leg got more oil than the other
2951 2018-08-22 19:13:37 How does #Venezuela have the worlds largest oil reserves and yet their economy is failing?

Bad governance, that’s how. 

#Venezuela #economy #SocialismKills
2952 2018-08-22 19:13:32 India-China-Japan must join hands to lower IMPORT BILL (OIL & GOLD).

2953 2018-08-22 19:13:31 yes he poured egg mixed with oil on Dan
2954 2018-08-22 19:13:30 It’s not like he suggested he’d change your oil.
2955 2018-08-22 19:13:28 ดีลลล เห็นแก่ของแลก 55
2956 2018-08-22 19:13:23 Honestly not surprised that coconut oil is considered unhealthy, I tried to drink some once and I didn't even swallow it and felt sick for hours.
2957 2018-08-22 19:13:23 Please read up on Taubes, Weston Price. Anything in excess is bad, fact. The problem with demonizing coconut oil is it is being linked to atherosclerosis when it is not. Cancer risk, yes. Heart disease, no. Statins don't work because of hypolipidemia but as anti-inflammatory.
2958 2018-08-22 19:13:21 You just keep  trying to sell us a lousy bill of goods. I think you are running out of snake oil.
2959 2018-08-22 19:13:18 Yeah but coconut oil’s real crime is that it can’t fry onions to save its life. #ICantCookWithIt #ItIsAPain
2960 2018-08-22 19:13:15 What about the wife and two children killed by the husband / father and buried in an oil tank.  Oh..he was just another crazy white guy...violence is awful..no matter who commits the crime.  Loss of young lives ( young women) happens all the time.. This is political BS for base !
2961 2018-08-22 19:13:14 Engine oil
2962 2018-08-22 19:12:58 Its probably Palm Oil industry, the destroyer of life.
2963 2018-08-22 19:12:58 Don't know what barbaric practices you talking about in the Africa I was raised in but you will tell me I'm hallucinating.  America is responsible for a lot of the unrest in the middle East just so they can exploit their oil reserves
2964 2018-08-22 19:12:54 HUGE difference between organic unrefined coconut oil & other oils too, and refined oil using toxic chemicals.  That is what’s poison. 
Been using coconut oil for hypothyroid for years, keeps swelling down.  Also for cholesterol levels; combined with low carb diet = low LDL.
2965 2018-08-22 19:12:44 Iraqi Oil Minister Al-Luaybi met with Iraqi President Fuad Masum concerning the unconstitutional measures taken by the Northern Oil Company against the Kurdish languages, Al-Luaybi ensured President Masum that "such measures will not be repeated," said Presidency office. #Iraq

2968 2018-08-22 19:12:35 That I can believe . Both must have used Oil of Ulay.
2969 2018-08-22 19:12:34 Grab her by the front hole.. hehe 
2970 2018-08-22 19:12:34 Don’t worry coconut oil, @realDonaldTrump is having a worse day than you.
2971 2018-08-22 19:12:23 I found vaping most effective but the oil is good too. Good luck!
2972 2018-08-22 19:12:20 We shouldn't base our economy on oil revenues you say ....... ah ... so thats where Norway went wrong eh? .... and just look how they have ended up ..... oh wait ! ! ! ! !

2974 2018-08-22 19:12:16 Even in Norway, oil money pays for a lot of their social services. They've been really smart about socking away money while prices are high too.

2980 2018-08-22 19:12:02 Dear @PollenStSocial 

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
2981 2018-08-22 19:11:59 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2982 2018-08-22 19:11:53 @shwood I don’t if anyone told you this before but you are as far as I can tell the best when it comes to advertising your sponsors. You are always original and creative. And may the Candle with Baby Oil and Yogurt always shine brighter.
2983 2018-08-22 19:11:33 I started tracking what I eat on my phone and like DAMN where did all this fat come from jeez

IT'S OLIVE OIL SAMSUNG HEALTH, DON'T COME FOR ME BBY
2984 2018-08-22 19:11:33 I haven't been able to find much, but what little i have, is that state-run oil companies in Europe do have more concerns about environmental factors than private US oil companies do, but there is no effective way to stop them from drilling once they've decided to do so.
2985 2018-08-22 19:11:32 In addition to being thicker, a man’s skin texture is tougher.
Sebum (oil) and its production also differ. After puberty, sebum production is greater in males than females, which is attributed to androgen secretions and accounts for why men have longer lasting acne
2986 2018-08-22 19:11:27 I don't know about pure poison, but I figured out myself years ago that the fact that coconut oil is solid at room temp is a indication it's not healthy to consume.
2987 2018-08-22 19:11:20 But dont worry, we were all fooled in the 70s that Palm oil is good for your health and cocnut oil is dangerous, this propaganda is just reaurfacing again, probably fundes by the palm oil industry
2988 2018-08-22 19:11:19 @ngscents I plan to pour container candles with Joy wax and fragrance oil. If I'm not going to color the candles, should I still heat to 200F then cool to add FO? Or can I simply heat to 170-175?
2989 2018-08-22 19:11:15 I wonder who funded the research TO promote coconut oil as a superfood :/ just follow the money folks
2990 2018-08-22 19:11:14 Jazzy gets Miamor malt treats (same idea as Lik-e-lix but with malt) that seems to work for her. Pumpkin can help apparently, as can olive oil. Just depends if you'll eat it!
2991 2018-08-22 19:11:01 you mean ppl was eating straight coconut oil????? fdjdksgskdh???
2992 2018-08-22 19:10:53 I mean, Christ does just mean “anointed”, and I DO use both olive and sesame oil in my hair and skincare routine.

So…yeah. Checks out.

2993 2018-08-22 19:10:38 Lmaoooooo every time I see or talk to my brother he tells me to check the oil in my car
2994 2018-08-22 19:10:36 Well i have to balance both sides two sides every story twitter is on the canvas with oil pastels.
2995 2018-08-22 19:10:29 My braids smell like peppermint oil and coconut oil...I’m jealous of my pillow
2996 2018-08-22 19:10:23 フラン姐さんに殴られたなう
2997 2018-08-22 19:10:22 I am clearly a caveman because I didn't know about coconut oil

I'll stick to my olive oil
2998 2018-08-22 19:10:22 Face oil bukan?
Nda cocok akutuh pake kleveru, sediih
2999 2018-08-22 19:10:17 Ordinary meat oil, I no lick 

Sallah na wa ooo! 
#Sallah
3000 2018-08-22 19:10:16 well alaska literally has a social oil fund that pays dividends to every resident of the state
3001 2018-08-22 19:10:15 When I get body pain from sitting I use lavender oil in a hot shower and just sit in it and it feels so much better. I walk dogs for a living so muscle cramping and body pain is my everyday lol.
3002 2018-08-22 19:10:14 The freely available sun & wind energy resources dwarf the energy we get from oil. That's why we need to keep transitioning to clean electrified energy systems.
3003 2018-08-22 19:10:14 In the mid 90s same was done to Mustard oil and now it's not even in the want list of shoppers. Thanks to @PypProducts that the market is reviving.
3004 2018-08-22 19:10:11 I need you to please show me how the palm oil is harvested sustainably.
3005 2018-08-22 19:10:05 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
3006 2018-08-22 19:09:59 Naah, as per his logic, make him drink that oil first
3007 2018-08-22 19:09:52 "looking at climate change as a symptom of a larger problem"? the environment is the largest thing on earth, so inequality is a symptom of environmental degradation, not the other way around. just put the oil companies out of business, so we can begin to heal.
3008 2018-08-22 19:09:51 Niggas really be eating coconut oil? Like ingesting that shit? LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
3009 2018-08-22 19:09:46 I beg to disagree,coconut oil is very healthy, it helps to lose weight and has regulated the blood pressure of many people.Coconut oil is very nutritious,but I'm not surprised with this research,as every good thing always have naysayers. Buy from success_organicproducts on IG
3010 2018-08-22 19:09:42 Ok, then keep living in fear and vote for folks who want to cut your social security, give tax cuts to oil companies who pollute your air and water, who want to bring back coal and asbestos to give you cancer and enrich themselves. You are one stable genius too after all!
3011 2018-08-22 19:09:38 I go to the river for my birthday, and like a dumb a** I put tanning oil on instead of sun screen. I regret life right now, I’m shedding like a dang snake!!!
3012 2018-08-22 19:09:35 Now are they gonna say PALM OIL is good?
3013 2018-08-22 19:09:27 I enjoy coconut oil daily. But then I understand that saturated fat does not cause heart disease.
3014 2018-08-22 19:09:17 Ya’ll really gonna believe what an old white lady has to say about coconut oil? Lol
3015 2018-08-22 19:09:15 getting stronger in azur lange feels good and bad at the same time

the good is, well, you get stronger
the bad is your oil cost increasing a lot
3016 2018-08-22 19:09:12 Calling the place I left my fucking hat and my oil pen at 
3017 2018-08-22 19:09:06 I’m really into Almond Oil my sensitive skin has life 
3018 2018-08-22 19:09:03 So, his ridiculous story is he was cheating on his wife and she strangled her daughters and he cared so much about his kids that he strangled his PREGNANT wife and dumped the bodies of the daughters he loved in oil tanks. Yeah, right.
3019 2018-08-22 19:08:57 Also affects the XE jaguar too.
In fact if you put 2 & 2 together you find it affects all the same vehicles as the oil dilution does too.
Coincidence ??
Or just that the diluted oil affects the lubrication of the balance shafts and turbos.
3020 2018-08-22 19:08:55 The plea, states Cohen gave MA a payment for the story of stormy, so the “paper” would not publish it. The payment was labeled “retainer”
3021 2018-08-22 19:08:52 Don't get to excited. The boys need to get future mother badges and the girls need to get future long haul truck driver  badges, ocean oil rig maintenance badges, roof tiler badges, deep sea diver badges, high rise construction workers' badges etc.
3022 2018-08-22 19:08:47 i been knew that coconut oil is bad for you
3023 2018-08-22 19:08:39 Things that typically struggle to coexist:

More shale gas/More coal

More coal exports/More trade barriers

Reduced coal regulation/New coal plant subsidies

Lower oil prices/Lower Iranian oil exports

total energy independence/globally connected marketplace
3024 2018-08-22 19:08:37 No problem! I’ve experimented with diff ingredients. I also add MCT Oil Powder. It’s chalky so I’ll probably get the oil once I run out. I’m only on day 13, I just researched for an entire month prior to starting.
3025 2018-08-22 19:08:34 U need to apply oil on those hands
3026 2018-08-22 19:08:24 A teaspoon of castor oil and witch hazel and go right back to rawing
3027 2018-08-22 19:08:16 Yeah, well at least unlike Feminist Frequency, this guy actually takes his time to likely put some research into his work, instead of spewing out stuff from his ass, in order to sell it as snake oil. |:^[
3028 2018-08-22 19:08:14 It’s a potato. That’s a vegetable! Fried in VEGETABLE OIL.
3029 2018-08-22 19:08:13 Ah, but what happens when government services and tax rates are dependent on the government being able to make a lot of oil revenue? Corporations drilling is someone else making money. The government drilling is me and you making money.
3030 2018-08-22 19:08:10 What did Trump have to say about the white,American,male in Colorado that just murdered his wife and 2 daughters 3 & 4 yrs old? Babes were hidden in oil tanks. There are bad people all over this country. Americans commit atrocious crimes on each other, he only talks of immigrants
3031 2018-08-22 19:08:10 I don't see any poison in coconut oil otherwise a lot of people would be dead so straight away we have a false statement.

More applicable is that the USA doesn't produce much coconut oil and there are vested interests in other products.
3032 2018-08-22 19:08:07 Oil today ....me
3033 2018-08-22 19:08:04 Besides water and flashlights/oil lamps, have food that requires no heating or can be grilled (if you have access). Sandwiches, cereal, hard boiled eggs, tuna, etc. Car full of gas in case you get evacuated. Portable power banks and batteries all charged up.
3034 2018-08-22 19:08:04 ipso facto? How about some basic facts, not your snake oil of palming one unrelated fact off onto another.
3035 2018-08-22 19:07:57 Using too much when you cook since it’s still an oil
3036 2018-08-22 19:07:55 African Americans swear by Coconut Oil in daily skin and hair products now there is research saying it’s poison
3037 2018-08-22 19:07:48 Just read about coconut oil and if you use it for cooking, use it sparingly as it's full of saturated fat.
I personally don't cook with it, good old olive oil for me, however I do use coconut oil for taking make-up off, from foundation to mascara. Works a charm, give it a go 
3038 2018-08-22 19:07:43 i love being burned by hot oil every day
3039 2018-08-22 19:07:41 Hemp oil

3042 2018-08-22 19:07:31 Getting my oil changed and trapped with daytime tv...
3043 2018-08-22 19:07:22 Pog will eventually realise he's being represented by a big fat Olive Oil drinking club promoter - then the only thing ur gna be leaching off is whatever fried food ur straddling
3044 2018-08-22 19:07:17 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
3045 2018-08-22 19:07:16 Yeah, it mostly hurts that we're selling oil at a heavy discount in the west, and buying it again in the east simply because we can't transport our product across our own country safely and economically.
3046 2018-08-22 19:07:12 Tänään ennätykselliset 20 + 75 + 60 = 145 selkomerkityksellistä kehoitusta irtautua fossiilisista ja panostaa energiatehokkuuteen. Päästökaupassa tonni nyt 20 e, brent crude oil 75 taalaa barreli ja sähkön systeemihinta Suomessa 60 euroa/MWh. Järkevä toimii nyt, ei ensi viikolla!
3047 2018-08-22 19:07:12 I wonder what’s the payout for the “professor”? I know several people, myself included, that have used internally and externally  organic coconut oil for years and it has done wonders for skin  and hair.
3048 2018-08-22 19:07:09 Dems only cry about loopholes they can't exploit to advance their agenda. 
With unemployment so low, why are we not scaling back on these programs?
3049 2018-08-22 19:07:03 I love oil
3050 2018-08-22 19:07:00 Republicans, used car dealers, and snake oil peddlers always can use professional liars.
3051 2018-08-22 19:06:57 Not bizarre at all at all. 
The key piece of unionist propoganda. "You cant afford Indy with oil = you certainly cant afford it without = you can never afford it" 

Repeated in any fiscal scenario.
3052 2018-08-22 19:06:52 Olive oil is pretty popular now
3053 2018-08-22 19:06:48 I like all strains if grown right.  The worst weed I had was when I sent money with someone and they came back with shit that had the smell of motor oil. Couldn't even smoke it. All the more reason I am happy to have legal rec here, now.  Happy #Weednesdaze Bro!  
3054 2018-08-22 19:06:43 Tired of sifting through mountains of confusing make-up/skincare  info? Tired of products with alcohol and mineral oil damaging your skin? DM me about an expert consultant who'll come to you  #WednesdayWisdom
3055 2018-08-22 19:06:35 If you break my heart na oil spillage oh, i no go lie baby you killing me softly with the way you whine you dey finish work oh.
3056 2018-08-22 19:06:23 I have so much chutney and frozen Ragu sauces in the freezer. Looking forward to "sundried" toms in olive oil. I've got sweet peppers on the grow too. So excited, but a little scared of it 
3057 2018-08-22 19:06:20 Norway produces double the oil, and has a state oil company, Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, unlikely Scotland could ever make 17bn a year in tax revenues im afraid, maybe in the past. With continued recovery 3-5bn a year is achievable.
3058 2018-08-22 19:06:18 I was about to tweet about how my usra project is fuckin useless but then i saw that story of a harvard prof calling coconut oil poison and im so tired
3059 2018-08-22 19:05:56 dont think oil is a factor. academics and analysts who usually use OIL as a major compenent in the underlying issue forget to address nations like Maldives and isolated places like Chechnya and Bangladesh where oil has little to no influence. They still only criticize minoriteies
3060 2018-08-22 19:05:54 And the man charged with murdering his wife and two girls (burying them in oil) was living her legally! Evil is evil!
3061 2018-08-22 19:05:51 Can we talk about the white guy
that killed his wife and daughters and stuffed his own babies into oil drums?
3062 2018-08-22 19:05:51 Lust and pride shoot the human spirit down into the cave of the flesh, but revelation of the word and fresh oil from the belly launches you like a rocket ship of God!
3063 2018-08-22 19:05:46 Thank you! I’ve had a number of people recommend CBD oil. It’s amazing what it can do.
3064 2018-08-22 19:05:41 Need to look at making access to oil barrels harder as well. It's way to easy for pretty boy white citizens to dump their baby girls bodies in them after they strangled the life out of them and their wife because they're an evil POS who couldn't keep their pants up...
3065 2018-08-22 19:05:41 #AAOG odds on the QandA next week is on the day of oil shows in first zone
3066 2018-08-22 19:05:39 Atoh. Se anyi kwana uku ma
3067 2018-08-22 19:05:34 Trump has only taken from America. His administration is giving up public lands to big oil, removing laws that protect the environment, putting tariffs on our farmers and gave tax cuts to the wealthy. Get real...you need "to understand". Not me.
3068 2018-08-22 19:05:31 This is BS, you know this is BS, #Gers doesn't count what is spent in Scotland, but what the UK government claims to spend on Scotlands behalf.  Norway made MORE from their oil generated wealth fund last year than the entire Scots govt budget. call it the benefit of Independence
3069 2018-08-22 19:05:22 Yes sir. Cohen labeled the payment to MA as retainer legal fees. It was processed as legal fees. That was the cover up. The fact MC used this method, almost shields the entire trump team and completely puts the burden of proof on Cohen. This is why trump doesn’t deal with cash.
3070 2018-08-22 19:05:17 @WeekendInvestng Dear Alok why oil PSUs are available so cheap in respect of their eps.
3071 2018-08-22 19:05:06 YEAH IDK WHY BUT aloe just /loves/ to be a bitch, but coconut oil is my personal fave bc it smells good, too!!!! but i hope your skin stops hurting soon !!!
3072 2018-08-22 19:05:00 We can expect Lying @realDonaldTrump to keep on lying. He sells snake oil, he's a con man, a charlatan and he's not trying to help the nation, he's trying only to help himself. Republicans must do a better job of finding leaders because this is no leader, he's a fragile divider.
3073 2018-08-22 19:04:58 The “coconut oil is pure poison” is the biggest load of BS I’ve heard.....since the “low carb diet will lead to early death!” I’m concerned about the journalists reporting this BS - they are either stupid or being bribed by Low Fat Big Food! 
3074 2018-08-22 19:04:57 Of all possible attorneys, Lanny Davis, close friends with Hillary since Yale and major fixer of her many scandals now represents Cohen? It's a vicious game in their circles, they don’t want to lose control. Not buying the snake oil.#CohenPleaDeal
3075 2018-08-22 19:04:56 Interesting. How would you see the heavy oil prospect in South Sudan, I have seen many steam generators activity which might indicate positive atmosphere. Eid Mubarik to you Dr. Anas and Dr. Sami
3076 2018-08-22 19:04:51 vee you're awesome! trying the wet cloth and i'll rest as soon as i get home c: i'll ask my mother to find me some mint oil hehe do you like eat it, scent it or just rub it??
3077 2018-08-22 19:04:41 My South Park script of choice would’ve been the oil company “were sorrrrrrrry” video
3078 2018-08-22 19:04:38 And non-poisoneous oil. Waiting to know what oil to use.
3079 2018-08-22 19:04:38 I'd agree, and we still need to work on that, but renewable energy is nowhere close to being consistent or dependable on the large scale yet. We're going to need oil for quite a while yet.

On a tangent from this, it's also ideal not to support countries like the Saudis.
3080 2018-08-22 19:04:32 These articles are always against our Indian culture. westerners would be going to market some crap on Indian consumers. Because of these types of articles people forget our tradition and Culture. Oil bath desi Ghee Neem stick tooth brush, salt coal in tooth paste.
3081 2018-08-22 19:04:32 Birds of a feather flock together. Trump and Cohen have been crooks for years ask any NYC legitimate businessman that would not do business with them. That’s why they took Russian money to survive. #DonTheCon is a snake oil salesman led by Putin.
3082 2018-08-22 19:04:31 Do you ever think to change your beard oil carrier?
3083 2018-08-22 19:04:31 I love oil hun and you would look absolutely amazing oiled up :) xxx
3084 2018-08-22 19:04:21 You should use coconut oil to fry food at high temperatures, because, unlike vegetable oils, it has a higher burn point and doesn’t turn into a carcinogen at high temperatures
3085 2018-08-22 19:04:17 Not exactly...most of the oil reserves are in the oil sands and hard to extract. Need breakthrough there for more $CAD demand. I'm not quite bullish on $CAD LT.
3086 2018-08-22 19:04:03 i need an oil change asap
3087 2018-08-22 19:04:00 Based off of what? Notice every mention, involves added things, like hydrogenation or no fiber. Imagine, a deep fried fast food diet, with minimal fiber, but the issue is the coconut oil. Maybe the health risk is the shitty, highly processed western diet.
3088 2018-08-22 19:03:59 I hate war so much, it's money. Not even money, over oil, over material that can never replace a person..
3089 2018-08-22 19:03:55 Never used it. Always knew high saturated fats and cardiologists don't recommend it. Especially if someone has genetic tendency for high cholesterol. I use olive oil.
3090 2018-08-22 19:03:45 CND and the EU countries were trying to convince Trump that all of them paying a carbon tax would be a good idea. That's why he suggested Russia be invited back. Guess where the EU countries get much of their oil & gas from? Russia, who isn't subject to the tax.
3091 2018-08-22 19:03:39 @Onnit 

Why can’t we get one solid answer about Coconut oil?  How can articles like that come out while Onnit backs it? As a consumer it’s tough to follow.
3092 2018-08-22 19:03:38 Processed coconut oil may not be good but direct unprocessed is good for health. You can refer to its usage in India, especially Kerala.
3093 2018-08-22 19:03:35 Not a proponent of the Jones Act--I would prefer that there was a different way to ensure that the maritime industry treated its employees decently--but it's only fair to note that oil producers (cough) oppose the Act bc of the EPA regulations.
3094 2018-08-22 19:03:34 Yet kept winning elections, and the living standards of the majority improved under him, no? Look at literacy rates, access to education, access to healthcare...

And he 'destroyed' the industry? Or was it more like oil prices collapsed after Saudi upped their production?
3095 2018-08-22 19:03:20 Maybe. Will it mean fewer wars over water and oil?
3096 2018-08-22 19:03:17 Coconut oil not poison OK
3097 2018-08-22 19:03:12 I thought cocunut oil was for topical use.
3098 2018-08-22 19:03:07 It's about time we sell the strategic oil reserve to my friends. We won't even miss it!
3099 2018-08-22 19:02:55 Bengalis  use mustard oil for everything, just like Malayalis use coconut oil. And there was some finding against mustard oil as well!!!!
3100 2018-08-22 19:02:55 I gotta get a oil change...
3101 2018-08-22 19:02:52 Agree. People in Southern India used #Coconutoil for generations as the main cooking oil. If it is bad, one would have seen a very high rate of heart issues there. I doubt Prof did some studies in areas that heavily use coconut oil
3102 2018-08-22 19:02:43 Our current heating oil price is at $2.899 per gallon!
(pay within 10 days get 5 cents off per gallon)
3103 2018-08-22 19:02:38 Coconut Oil is considered "pure poison" because of it's "high levels of saturated fatty acids"... but McDonald's though 

Fixed your headline

3106 2018-08-22 19:02:19 western science is interesting bcuz back in the 80s the convinced us using coconut oil was bad, to only sell us coconut oil now in the 10s as some superfood and again telling us its bad when we start to produce it again
3107 2018-08-22 19:02:17 I’ve never better using coconut oil.  Not only is it really good for you it helps with brain function.  Not all saturated fats are the same.  Animal fats are totally different.  This myth has been debunked already. Sorry I lost respect in Harvard
3108 2018-08-22 19:02:14 Coconut oil is not a hydrator  I’m tired of these brands lying to my homegirls
3109 2018-08-22 19:02:12 If #venezuela shud abolish its central bank then so shud the creature from jeckylisland - U.S Fed -(up world ) b abolished...all currencies r pegged 2d dollar..isint it...oil+ gold+ crypto is d way forward...
3110 2018-08-22 19:02:10 my friend just did the same. read the book enchanting beauty, she discusses castor oil cleanse which will help a lot. here for any questions etc  i love you!!!
3111 2018-08-22 19:02:09 Processed coconut oil may not be good but direct unprocessed is good for health. You can refer to its usage in India, especially Kerala.
3112 2018-08-22 19:02:08 I learned in college that coconut oil is not great to eat. My textbook had a chart breaking down oils and coconut oil was one of the worst. It's nice in my hair though 
3113 2018-08-22 19:02:06 usually just wash my face once a day with either st ives exfoliating wash or another type of cleanser (cvs brand or smth) and then i moisturize w almond oil 
3114 2018-08-22 19:01:37 Clair Ridge will start up this year. Will pump over 100k barrels a day at peak and 640m total over the next 30 years. At today’s oil price that’s around £35bn worth. BP are also appraising Clair south project now the next platform on the field, which will target a further 300m+
3115 2018-08-22 19:01:35 They don't care, it's a take the money and run move.  They figure if the electorate will swallow @realDonaldTrump snake oil, then they will pretty much swallow anything.
3116 2018-08-22 19:01:26 그분도 덕후였나봐..
3117 2018-08-22 19:01:16 Processed coconut oil may not be good but direct unprocessed is good for health. You can refer to its usage in India, especially Kerala.
3118 2018-08-22 19:01:13 Oil exploration is destroying the mangrove at alarming rates, hence the need to protect and conserve these delicate areas #EcoAwareness

"Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.
3120 2018-08-22 19:01:11 @KetoConnect Did you see that article about coconut oil being bad after all? If so, what were your thoughts? Thanks!
3121 2018-08-22 19:01:07 Processed coconut oil may not be good but direct unprocessed is good for health. You can refer to its usage in India, especially Kerala.
3122 2018-08-22 19:01:06 the Victoria secret oil smells so good
3123 2018-08-22 19:01:05 Yet people who only have access to coconuts and the oil are healthier,  on less medication,  have clear skin,  and so on and so on.  Pure poison,  lol

3124 2018-08-22 19:01:02 It seems, there are paralel 2 thinks: 1) aim of globalists is to weaken local comunities everywhere; 2) one of religions is priviliged because it is a religion of oil countries.

3126 2018-08-22 19:00:53 Dow transports pull back 1% from record, as airline stocks hit by crude oil's surge
3127 2018-08-22 19:00:50 People in Southern part of India used Coconut oil for generations as the main cooking oil. If it is bad, you would have seen a very high rate of heart issues there. I doubt Prof did some studies in areas that heavily use coconut oil
3128 2018-08-22 19:00:48 I told Pedro I needed oil from the store (thinking he was going to get olive oil) 

And he sends me a picture of oil that you put in your car and says okay which one? 

 you guys I’m literally dying right now!!!
3129 2018-08-22 19:00:48 Trash take. Saturated fats aren't always bad. Olive oil is saturated. And isn't dietary cholesterol the substrate for testosterone production, aka the mother sex hormone? Beware of absolute statements. Ex: Trans fats are bad for you...but CLA is a trans fat, and healthy.

3132 2018-08-22 19:00:26 Yeah olive oil is gold! It is full of antioxidants. It's one of the few things that lowers LDL and helps raise HDL cholesterol, it is rich in phenolics a substance from plants that helps make blood less likely to clot.

3134 2018-08-22 19:00:14 I really like it and olive oil too

Carpaccio of air cured beef, arugula, shaved parmesan and olive oil
3137 2018-08-22 18:59:58 I’m pretty sure they don’t have blood and guts but maybe carparts and oil
3138 2018-08-22 18:59:51 بخصوص الفصل في distillation column على اي اساس نضع عدد الTreys بداخلها هل حسب المواد المراد فصلها مثل Crude oil
3139 2018-08-22 18:59:47 Now if you want the US government to take over the oil industry, I say go for it. We'd drill like crazy if it was funding government services.
3140 2018-08-22 18:59:44 Kinda crazy, now you can also pick up Beers like Oude Geuze, calypso,Ninkasi,Neck oil etc in Waitrose.
3141 2018-08-22 18:59:39 I suppose you asked him how UK would cope w/out oil revenues?
You didn’t?
Well that’s just silly. All that debt run up by the ‘UK’ government & what do we have to show for it? Nothing. 
Except the rich getting richer & the porters paying for the privilege of being poorer.
3142 2018-08-22 18:59:33 I don't know. Licences go to smaller exploration companies as well as oil majors and during low price years exploration is first to suffer. I expect, as a result of aforementioned siesmic surveys, and oil price being higher, we will see a fair few new announcements about finds.
3143 2018-08-22 18:59:27 annoyed at myself for falling in love with luna oil bc this shit is $105 a bottle

Yes, there are pockets of people doing well.  My state has an oil boom, and our economy is doing well, but there are still many people who live right on the edge.
3146 2018-08-22 18:59:24 QUESTION:
[Yes -Coconut Oil is saturated fat, BUT it is not from an animal.]
 - So, is plant saturate fat easier for the body metabolize? Is it really as bad as animal saturate fat?

 #science #coconutoil
3147 2018-08-22 18:59:17 I want fall to come and I use Suave coconut oil shampoo and then Pantene conditioner. After my showering, I dry off my hair until it has a light dampness. Once there, I grab my all natural coconut oil and massage it deep into all areas of my hair. What’s your point?
3148 2018-08-22 18:59:12 It’s only a fucking oil change damn
3149 2018-08-22 18:59:06 Devils advocate: Having a bunch of coconut oil incorporated as part of typical western diet prob isn't good for you, BUT most people who know about/use coconut oil aren't eating a western diet w processed foods & sugars...lots of them are reaping benefits of going keto
#ketodiet
3150 2018-08-22 18:59:03 Mt darling husband didn't put any oil in it.  That's now sorted, so should be OK for the AM. He's not on social media so I'm safe :)

3152 2018-08-22 18:59:02 One of the main reasons Miyetti Allah commands attention is coz they are organized, coordinated, strategic & fully funded. I wonder what would happen if motor spare parts association gets organized, palm oil producers association, aseoke association and every other association.
3153 2018-08-22 18:58:57 Absolutely true over decades westerners fooled us in cohoots with some Indian  Desi Ghee, Mustard oil, Coconut oil, Ground nut oil were said to cause Cancer bullshit - promoted refined oil  even bird flu & all also seems to be fake fear psychology for pushing sales
3154 2018-08-22 18:58:52 For years, everything I read said “don’t eat coconut oil”. Then, all of a sudden...eat coconut oil. Which is it? How about Fractionated Coconut oil?
3155 2018-08-22 18:58:49 That figure is a bit misleading, and it's still a far cry from government controlling or centrally planning the economy. Norway is also a petrostate and the fact that they control the oil skews the numbers. Norway has a thriving capitalist market in most industries.
3156 2018-08-22 18:58:47 had to look up wat vegemite was that shit look like dried up car oil
3157 2018-08-22 18:58:43 Makes me sick that my oil change cost $69 
3158 2018-08-22 18:58:40 Lindsey Graham 

1 Part Snake 
1 Part Oil
3159 2018-08-22 18:58:30 What about not eating it, but using it for your skin? But it's got to be better to cook with than veg oil. Not as good as olive oil but what's up?
3160 2018-08-22 18:58:29 cause you're not getting away from a world where oil is important, soooo why are you fighting Ethical development?
3161 2018-08-22 18:58:28 indians predominantly use coconut oil, and there are a billion plus.  Harvard professor was funded by Olive oil companies may be :D
3162 2018-08-22 18:58:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,

cooking a simple ham.

3165 2018-08-22 18:57:45 White people should not eat coconut oil. They do not have the genetic makeup to process it. They should stick to carcass fat.
3166 2018-08-22 18:57:44 So you've never had a flare up before, just after eating the ice-cream, have you a pic of the ingredients label?   Aloe vera is good for calming skin or something like coconut or almond oil 
3167 2018-08-22 18:57:42 @Nigel_Farage asks a doctor “who are you?” - well, Rachel is someone who is a benefit to society. She saves lives; not promotes their destruction. The sort of person who helps.....oh, aircraft crash victims?

Conversely, you are a grifter; a grubby little snake oil salesman.
3168 2018-08-22 18:57:35 No, It has a laquer or varnish or oil finish. The charcoal brush is antibacterial!
3169 2018-08-22 18:57:24 Likoro oil & gas!
3170 2018-08-22 18:57:22 so you want Saudi oil?
3171 2018-08-22 18:57:17 Have to use oil to make Materials to save the environment. have to use coal, oil, propane, and natural gas to make the world go around and this day and age. People are always going to use it. They just will ha e to deal with I guess. Got to heat your house somehow.
3172 2018-08-22 18:57:16 It’s great for cooking, I don’t use vegetable oil any more. This, olive oil, and grape seed oil are my go to’s. Not really eating raw.
3173 2018-08-22 18:57:13 A Colorado man, U.S. Citizen, was this past week charged with first-degree murder of his pregnant wife and two small children. He buried his wife in an oil field and threw his dead children into an oil tank. They also were “permanently separated.” Political affiliations unknown.

Your ignorant and unconstitutional agenda is driven by your desire for personal profits and you fuel it all with hate and fear. 

Kansans deserve better than you.

3176 2018-08-22 18:56:56 Indeed! Only the squeaky wheels get oil...Sadly
3177 2018-08-22 18:56:45 Friend: “I eat a tablespoon of coconut oil every day for my health and you should, too.”
News: “Harvard professor says coconut oil is ‘pure poison.’”

3178 2018-08-22 18:56:43 Can see why it’s been pulled given where the oil price was when they announced & where is now - so confident they are again in the black gold & the impossibility of listing something that has become even bigger since then
3179 2018-08-22 18:56:39 Kkkk zvinoshupa. Thats y i focus on the hydration, moisturisation and fitness part of my life.  Coconut oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil, almond oil. Somebodys son acting funny can go to the left with that nonsense

3181 2018-08-22 18:56:33 She defined it as “nothing” but indeed she had EVERYTHING! “ - @NateJGriffin ... what do you have in your house?” “Your servant has nothing there at all,” she said, “except a small jar of olive oil.””
2 Kings 4:2 NIV
3182 2018-08-22 18:56:32 So beyond atrocious. So, be that logic: all white male oil workers from Colorado are clearly evil, irredeemable murderers. That’s how it works, right @realcandaceo ???
3183 2018-08-22 18:56:30 I'm allergic to coconut and coconut oil. My EPI-pen saved my life twice. Anyway, there's my argument against it
 
3184 2018-08-22 18:56:28 Not true. Some of us are car buffs. I know quite a few men that also just get in a car and drive. Can’t even tell you where the oil stick is
3185 2018-08-22 18:56:20 Rosemary is an aromatic delight. But have you ever seasoned your roast potatoes with onion salts and sage. Just the simple dried stuff. Glaze them over with a simple oil then sprinkle and roast .... heaven!

3188 2018-08-22 18:56:12 Mundell wants us all believing that Scotlands better pulling and sharing 2 trillion of debt with the U.K. rather than repairing our own economy and using oil as part of that. 

Not everyone’s got dark money available to flash around David!!
3189 2018-08-22 18:56:12 .. For example, lemme know when they're pushing actual snake oil and not just a book that let's me decide for myself whether they're right or not, yea?
3190 2018-08-22 18:56:11 Phew. Thank goodness we let the financial wizards and Govt in London manage all our oil. Otherwise we'd obviously just be like Venezuela by now....
3191 2018-08-22 18:56:10 Agreed! drinking decaf coffee is equivalent to changing the oil in a car, but leaving the old filter. #DontMakeSense
3192 2018-08-22 18:56:07 Have you looked into Black Seed Oil for dogs?
3193 2018-08-22 18:56:03 These dogs - you've gotta oil them up every night
3194 2018-08-22 18:56:01 At 8 with Elizabeth - What's wrong with coconut oil?
3195 2018-08-22 18:55:49 last-minute meal: 

 bread
leek

 wash with oil
grill uniformly
serve with a tablespoon of butter 
 enjoy
3196 2018-08-22 18:55:45 I pity those that went to oil mill today that soaking no be here kiki
3197 2018-08-22 18:55:41 I know coconut oil is nowhere near as healthy as some 'wellness' bloggers would have you believe, but it's definitely not 'pure poison'. I've both eaten it and used it on my eczema, and I'm still at the same level of alive as I was before I bought it.
3198 2018-08-22 18:55:38 That killing was heartbreaking. It’s also true a white man strangled his wife and kids, then dumped the kids in an oil tank and has tried to pin it on his wife. Murderous assholes come in all colors, including white. On average, migrants are much less inclined to commit crimes.
3199 2018-08-22 18:55:36 Redirection.
3200 2018-08-22 18:55:35 If it was on Top of an OIL Field! lol
3201 2018-08-22 18:55:24 I think the secret is you feel absolutely nothing. Not even tension. Idk my mom has the oil and I’m thinking of getting some for anxiety but there’s so many and I don’t just want something that’s like vitamin c, I want to knownits working
3202 2018-08-22 18:55:16 Brent crude oil futures, added 3.0%, testing a new buy at the 50-day moving average. WTI 3.2% higher to $67.9 per barrel.  Oil prices strengthened after the API said stockpiles declined by 5.2 mm barrels last week.
Got oil? Virtually nothing else is up today!
3203 2018-08-22 18:55:14 Very soon, sale of olive oil will spike.
3204 2018-08-22 18:55:13 heres a crazy idea...how about just reading on the labels and find a oil/butter that has very little sat fat...thats what i did.

but what do i know.
3205 2018-08-22 18:55:10 Ugh, if a recipe consists of garlic, olive oil, eggs, red pepper, sea salt, oregano, pasta, and cheese, no, that is not a "three-ingredient recipe." :P *sideeye*
3206 2018-08-22 18:55:09 What Nigeria need to survive is not the #Oil but the Money. Why not keep the Oil underground and embrace other Economic Models? @NnimmoB
3207 2018-08-22 18:55:07 And their all wearing clothes...a derivative of oil. Hmmm
3208 2018-08-22 18:54:52 Diesel and oil everywhere In #wigan an #leigh actually went through an oil slick at one point, really thought I was gonna go down.

3218 2018-08-22 18:53:56 @BrianOHemphill There is someone under the name Anderson, Zach <zanderson6@email.radford.edu> that is sending scam emails for FLEXIBLE PART-TIME CONTRACT PROGRAM allegedly for the Company Kanji Oil & Gas Services LTD which operates in Japan and has ZERO positions opened operating
3219 2018-08-22 18:53:55 Yet they never flooded the market and they have stopped reporting reserves since 1982. Their last major oil discovery was in the 90’s. They would have to disclose their reserves in an IPO and I think people would be surprised what the real number is, which would more than likely.
3220 2018-08-22 18:53:54 That pain you experience when you accidentally get Olbas Oil in your eye. Yes that    #onfire
3221 2018-08-22 18:53:48 i wonder what they have over her bc at this rate this ship will go down burning in russian waters in its own oil and covered in feces. like what could possibly be worse for her personally than the utter career tanking that she's facing for covering his ass with her bare hands?
3222 2018-08-22 18:53:37 Lol, only Uhuru and Raila understand the level of their handshake the rest of us are spectators.Sad that some people are selling Snake oil by claiming to have made the handshake possible 
3223 2018-08-22 18:53:37 I’ve been feeding my dog coconut oil and just now found out that it could be killing him instead.... #wtf
3224 2018-08-22 18:53:34 You can't blame Trudeau for low oil prices or the fact that Alberta hasn't diversfied their economy. Try again.
3225 2018-08-22 18:53:32 Seems like #FakeResearch as Coconut oil is used for centuries. They should focus on how bad sugar is for your body!
3226 2018-08-22 18:53:31 Currently no wait for oil changes or inspections.  We are also accepting appointments for brakes and tune ups.
3227 2018-08-22 18:53:29 I read AVVO as Axtra Virgin Volive Oil

3233 2018-08-22 18:52:48 But anointing oil is more expensive than vegetable oil na
3234 2018-08-22 18:52:32 And the wife and daughters murdered and stuffed into oil containers by their white hus ... oh, nevermind.  Answered my own question.
3235 2018-08-22 18:52:25 I’m absolutely loving this #coconutoil controversy... should I put butter or coconut oil on my popcorn as I watch the internet explode?
3236 2018-08-22 18:52:25 Okay I’ll go get an oil change Friday before I leave town  I’m too lazy to leave today even though I wanted to be outside and enjoy the weather
3237 2018-08-22 18:52:23 I already knew 100% that they were going to do this
Talk of an IPO started when oil was low, at the same time SA tried to assert market dominance by flooding the market.
The pound their chest they also talked how SAram is worth 2 trillion dollars, worlds most valuable company ...
3238 2018-08-22 18:52:04 Allah ya mai Mai ta mana Chairman Azman oil & Gas 
3239 2018-08-22 18:51:58 hostess, taco bell, and white castle have no issues with this, the only difference with oil really is that depending on the time of month it's seasoned. My fryer oil tastes very similar to most fast food at the moment since it's seasoned
3240 2018-08-22 18:51:50 Stop being racist. How about the American dad that just strangled his whole family, dumped his two little girls in an empty well filled with crude oil and lied about it for three days. Women get murdered everyday and generally by someone close to them.

3244 2018-08-22 18:51:14 Did the researcher study the effects of coconut oil consumption on people who have been consuming it for years? (The South Indian region would make for a vast enough sample size for this purpose). If not, I suspect the findings of the study may not be robust.
3245 2018-08-22 18:51:11 im not one for picking sides but you niggas who dont know how to fix flat tires or change oil need to stop coming at my queens who not the illest on the stove top.
3246 2018-08-22 18:51:07 Got an oil change at #JiffyLube and was charge $103!  Why do they think their oil changes are worth THREE times as much as their competitors?  Go some where else!  #JiffyFleece
3247 2018-08-22 18:51:04 Ha! First butter, then eggs, now coconut oil and you ignant mfs want to try to tell me that science has disproven Gods existence.  k
3248 2018-08-22 18:51:00 That's not a done deal yet. They're negotiating he already has China taking the 25% oil tariff off oil. The EU and Mexico are coming around  they're ready to do a deals almost  tariff free. We'll see what happens but I think you under estimating his negotiating skills.

3253 2018-08-22 18:50:43 Benefits of the Union you say...
Norway has a oil funded wealth fund of $1.1 Trillion USD, 
Scotland has extracted more oil than Norway and has a share of the UKs 1.7 Trillion debt.
I think Norway is suffering from the benefits of Independence
3254 2018-08-22 18:50:28 Thank you for bringing war in every oil producing country...!.....sorry I‘m wrong it was only for the freedom of the people!
3255 2018-08-22 18:50:21 It's because they have oil, isn't it?
3256 2018-08-22 18:50:16 I do a deep moisturizing hair mask with coconut oil once a week. I saturate my hair in the oil, wrap my hair in a plastic bag, leave it on for a hour or so & shampoo out. It makes so soft. Sometimes I add an avocado too.
3257 2018-08-22 18:50:14 With the right oil, true...dirty chips.
3258 2018-08-22 18:50:08 Just another Clinton backed operation.
3259 2018-08-22 18:50:02 Sorta related note:  had a friend who used coconut oil for everything but it gave her the runs. Every. Single. Time. She kept using because her other friend told her that was the coconut oil drawing out the toxins from her body. 
3260 2018-08-22 18:50:00 War for profits! That is the real meaning of all war, profit, money, military contracts, oil, resources, control.
3261 2018-08-22 18:49:58 Oh...let's start using olive oil and imported oils
3262 2018-08-22 18:49:57 I dunno if it'll help but I can bring ya some of my CBD oil in a couple weeks at the Rochester date! Also: cookies 
3263 2018-08-22 18:49:51 Muppet Melissa. A complete muppet. 

I don’t see any argument basing Indy on oil. It’s part of the arithmetic however whether he likes it or not.
3264 2018-08-22 18:49:49 Indian people have known for thousands of years that coconut oil is not meant to be eaten but rather slathered on our heads. Harvard behind times on this 
3265 2018-08-22 18:49:39 Caprese Salad is what they were referring to: tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, olive oil, salt, pepper 
3266 2018-08-22 18:49:24 ㄱㅇㄱ
3267 2018-08-22 18:49:24 Oil, that's why Venezuela is in the news.
3268 2018-08-22 18:49:18 What about the white male who cheated on his pregnant wife, then killed her and her unborn child, buried her in a shallow grave, and strangled his own 2 young daughters and stuffed them in an oil well?

Is the GOP going to focus and call that out? Or just the “brown skins”.
3269 2018-08-22 18:49:13 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
3270 2018-08-22 18:49:13 I guess I shouldn't tell him about the time your fingers were knuckles deep in my beard, giving that DEEP oil rub. #shhhhhhh
3271 2018-08-22 18:49:12 need some oil for my beard.
3272 2018-08-22 18:49:06 Seriously? He wasn’t at all Christian. People are idiots. He strangled his own babies and stuck them down an oil well . How Christian of him
3273 2018-08-22 18:49:05 Here's a race card for ya! White, American born husband strangles pregnant wife and two little daughers. Puts daughters dead bodies in oil drums. Discuss? Media is silent on this.
3274 2018-08-22 18:49:04 Surely the Scottish Govt should have the right to see in detail the costs that are being put in its expenses column. They should also have the right to reject costs that it thinks have been costed in error.
All oil revenue should be included.
3275 2018-08-22 18:49:03 I make my popcorn in the Instant Pot, John! I'm good for quite a while. It only takes
 2T. oil (I use coconut oil) and 1/2 cup of popcorn.
3276 2018-08-22 18:49:03 How? I'd like to think its a win for environmentalist in us & europe to keep away investors to put money in an oil firm. It being called off creates further speculation on low oil prices.
3277 2018-08-22 18:48:57 Thank u. It was a bust. Only the oil version of MJ is legal in VA & it doesn’t help w/sleep so I’m out of luck.
3278 2018-08-22 18:48:51 that shit aint gonna wipe off all the oil from pizza!!!
3279 2018-08-22 18:48:46 Wenn du das möchtest sehr gerne. Nach der Oil Massage müsste man aber in die wanne voller schaum dort einen Sekt mit Erdbeeren geniessen und wenn du magst intim Rasieren 
3280 2018-08-22 18:48:45 Me to parents: don’t send me to get the car’s oil change and tires bc I won’t know anything they’re talking about and won’t be able to relay info back to you

Parents: *sends me anyway* so what kind of tires are we getting? Anything wrong with car?

I TOLD YOU I DONT KNOW
3281 2018-08-22 18:48:40 Keep buying coconut oil, and encourage others to keep buying coconut oil. Markets bend to the will of where the money is going.

Vote with your dollar and it doesn't matter what the propagandists say.
3282 2018-08-22 18:48:34 You know theyre not actually going to run on any of that though right? Those policies would put them in power and keep them there for decades. But theyd have to buck big money donors and that is something they just won't do. Just look at Tom Perez, he sold us all out for Oil $.
3283 2018-08-22 18:48:32 Saying that coconut oil is poison is bs.. lol
3284 2018-08-22 18:48:32 Me too. Don't really like coconut oil. Low carb with veg instead of starch.  #Parkrun once a week and 5km at the gym 2 or 3 times. Perfect BMI and type 2 diabetes in remission.
3285 2018-08-22 18:48:32 Mnmm Where do all our taxes from. Income tax   tax on oil production. tax on petrol.     tax on purchases.   tax on national insurance   in fact. All taxes raised here go.  Oh. ENGLAND.  Do we get it all back.  Don t think so. SO which country relies on which?
3286 2018-08-22 18:48:31 Never had it, probably never will. The liver is the body's equivalent to an oil filter in a car. No thanks. More for you!  Cheers!
3287 2018-08-22 18:48:27 Coconut Oil is dangerous!
3288 2018-08-22 18:48:12 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jared Polis says he opposes Initiative 97, seconds after a third protestor shouting questions about his record on oil and gas, is escorted out. #COGA2018
3289 2018-08-22 18:48:06 I HATE getting my oil changed. I need to learn how to do it myself or get a man that knows how. Everytime I know they’re gonna walk in and tell me I need 8 new things and it preys on my hate for telling people no complex 
3290 2018-08-22 18:48:05 The first thing you should know is that curcumin – the main beneficial bioactive ingredient in turmeric – is not soluble in water, but only in fats and oils. Therefore, it’s best to combine turmeric with healthy oils such as extra virgin olive or coconut oil whenever possible.
3291 2018-08-22 18:47:51 Doing what is right for the UK, see that’s where the issue lies; says who? If the ‘right folk’ continue to present themselves as the smart arses who didn’t get conned by the snake oil sales men; everyone will hold their position. No one likes a smart arse!
3292 2018-08-22 18:47:46 How about this; forget the pipeline , sell to a landlocked market @2/3 the price; keep buying oil from Saudia Arabia @ 8 b $ /yr; keep Canada dependant on foreign investors, poor & virtually bankrupt paying massive billions of $ on interest payments.
3293 2018-08-22 18:47:45 OMG I forgot about that!!! That was so tragic!!  it was a whole thing of olive oil lmao I used it to take off my makeup and I had just filled it 
3294 2018-08-22 18:47:44 Getting my car's oil changed and come to find out my air filter was absolutely smoked and one of my windshield wipers is torn. So I'm getting those fixed as well. And they took $15 off the total for me. How nice of them 
3295 2018-08-22 18:47:43 I doubt its about $. More like getting Trump and diverting attention away from Hillary and spying.
3296 2018-08-22 18:47:42 You know what? Someone made this years ago at work and we bravely tried it. It was the best chocolate cake ever! The mayo replaces the eggs and oil. Try it! Xx
3297 2018-08-22 18:47:35 Maybe big oil should spend its own damn dime. Making billions, being partly responsible for some of the biggest disasters out there, yet asking the government to make sure its citizens pay for its protection? Get lost.
3298 2018-08-22 18:47:32 If you are looking a filling meal without stretching your stomach, choose a lower level of oil on your order sheet.  This is the handy ramen customization trick for people with small/weak stomachs--and for people prone to acne outbreaks!  #WednesdayWisdom
3299 2018-08-22 18:47:20 The oil curse
3300 2018-08-22 18:47:18 Nothing about the guy in Fredrick Co that killed his wife &  2 Girls & put them in barrels of OIL? WHY?
3301 2018-08-22 18:47:17 not gonna lie, pretty triggered that Jim Beam's marketing plan is: "Drink this thing that tastes like motor oil with nothing but ice cubes"

3303 2018-08-22 18:46:58 Speaking at an an oil-and-gas conference, Democratic #cogov nominee Jared Polis said he opposes Initiative 97, saying it would ban fracking in Colorado. Also opposes #108, the private property compensation measure.
3304 2018-08-22 18:46:58 I don't see why cancelling the Aramco IPO would mean more bond issuances. The money from the IPO was never intended for budget use. KSA may certainly issue more bonds if rates are good, just like any other dev country but if oil trends higher may not even need to.

3306 2018-08-22 18:46:43 This has all the ear marks of a vote buying attempt.  Which company wants to attempt a run through this maze? Are there any majors that want to invest in Alberta right now? The NDP wanted to shut down Oil Industry, hmm why the policy change? Votes, votes
3307 2018-08-22 18:46:37 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

3310 2018-08-22 18:46:25 I need to trim the yard a bit today. That will lead to the break in oil change on the mower. 

I also want to take a nap. 

Which will win?
3311 2018-08-22 18:46:14 So horrifying. That man was praised and loved by his family! Dumping those babies in oil tanks? He is not even human! For what does a man gain, when he throws away his soul? Wished this NEVER HAPPENED, can't get this family off my mind!

What's your opinion of Coconut Oil, and the statements of the Harvard Professor saying it is 'Pure Poison?'
3316 2018-08-22 18:45:45 Im getting an oil change and somebody in here smells like old collard green juice and Im still a lil hungover from last night 
3317 2018-08-22 18:45:27 Lot of oil in there though! My expertise on explosive capability is admittedly limited 
3318 2018-08-22 18:45:22 Clintons not in the clear yet. This smells like the sleazy tactics they are famous for in covering up their crimes.
3319 2018-08-22 18:45:21 If a randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of CBD oil from cannabis vs traditional pharmaceuticals such as SSRI's, I would bet my entire career that CBD oil would be deemed more efficacious with less side effects.

3342 2018-08-22 18:43:04 There is a surplus in demand coming for palm oil.
With trade tensions and tarriffs coming against the US from most countries, demand for palm oil will hit the roof. They produce 30% of the world's Soya.
For us, it could well replace crude in this global supply chain landscape.

It's a desperation tax on the poor and throw away money for the rich.

Taxes? The oil co's should pay us all royalties like they do in Alaska.

3353 2018-08-22 18:42:06 So energy coming from Canada is actually "ethical"? How does a resource actually have ethics? I am not following the logic here. Sourcing conventional oil rather than a product that has higher environmental impacts seems to be a positive action. #cdnpoli

3357 2018-08-22 18:41:59 Alex, it is a quite expected news. Rumors have circulated since April'18 at least. Too high evaluation of the company ($2-2.5 trillion) & lack of investors interest under current crude oil price are among key reasons to call off. "Family" business is still better for Saudi king))

3388 2018-08-22 18:40:10 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。

3391 2018-08-22 18:40:00 The yoons keep saying Scotland's economy shouldn't rely on oil revenue yet  it's OK for the UK economy to do so. Fkin hypocrites
3392 2018-08-22 18:39:47 a wise man once said that when El Trumpo issues an executive order, Paul Ryan silently prays for help #resist
3393 2018-08-22 18:39:44 Pure poison? I should have died a million deaths already, then. The oil is probably overrated but that doesnt allow academics to make outrageous statements either...
3394 2018-08-22 18:39:41 @VictoryLaneOil Hello! I was wondering how I could get the Garrett Smithley #99 and #7 Victory Lane Oil hero cards!
3395 2018-08-22 18:39:41 I’m going to try out this she’s butter. Plus return to jojoba oil as my main moisturiser.
3396 2018-08-22 18:39:38 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
3397 2018-08-22 18:39:36 #Colorado oil and gas companies are also very philanthropic with #Veterans organizations and big employers of former military members.

3400 2018-08-22 18:39:15 being half an hour early for my oil change today makes up for being half an hour late to my hair appointment yesterday, right?
3401 2018-08-22 18:39:11 Free flowing lovely bubbly oil!
3402 2018-08-22 18:39:03 The EROEI on solar is about 2. Oil is >35. Coal is 80. It is utterly illusory to think that the current global economy can be run on renewable electricity. Oil s also a liquid fuel - transport - and is in everything we consume
3403 2018-08-22 18:38:51 Obama library deserves to be a rest stop on I 57. No legacy left except a failed Obamacare and a political spy operation.
3404 2018-08-22 18:38:51 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
3405 2018-08-22 18:38:45 I have one but the oil just goes right through it and into my face

3407 2018-08-22 18:38:40 Changed my bike oil! Hopefully he'll run a little better.
3408 2018-08-22 18:38:36 Considering that Venezuela's primary export and wealth generator is oil, and the fact that Venezuela's economy needs the global oil market more than the oil market needs Venezuela, the idea of Venezuela leading any kind of postneoliberal order was a pipe dream.
3409 2018-08-22 18:38:36 & it's a statement to camera - allowing him to effectively frame the 'facts' as he sees them (with an authoritative backdrop no less.)
So the casual viewers hears,  "we're too poor even without oil - I knew that."
It's very well done.
3410 2018-08-22 18:38:30 Hey aroma oil diffuser(@madajian), thank you for following me

3423 2018-08-22 18:37:48 @ErinOTooleMP Hopefully we will not be bullied by USA into signing a deal. We need to not agree on the energy selling of oil to them at under cost. That will be first. Then autos. Not vice versa
3424 2018-08-22 18:37:27 I once had a citrus cosmopolitan - really zingy and fresh - no cranberry juice but set aflame with orange peel oil on top. Never been able to find it since. Will see you next Tuesday if he can make it?
3425 2018-08-22 18:37:13 Yeah it uses hot air to pop it rather than oil.

3435 2018-08-22 18:36:15 Do BDS at your own peril. Or have I overlooked all that the Arab world has brought to the table? Aside from oil and terrorism, what else is there? Yep, best to side with a culture of death, those invented palestinians.
3436 2018-08-22 18:36:09 1. You don’t get tickets every month & if so you get months to pay it. 2. You don’t get flat tires OR need oil changes every month (that’s where budgeting when to do that comes in) 3. if you’re struggling w/ 5 kids apply for food stamps or budget your grocery spending.
3437 2018-08-22 18:36:02 Hey you ignoramus, US sanctions to Venezuela started in mid 2014 and have mostly ONLY included REGIME OFFICIALS personalized to THEIR foreign accounts and dealings, there are no generalized widespread sanctions against the country. The US still buys MOST Venezuelan oil.
3438 2018-08-22 18:35:52 Well, I'm very proud of you and also remind me to check your tire pressure and change your oil next time I see you.
3439 2018-08-22 18:35:51 Oh aye... better together my foot! You might want to be a subsidy junkie, or to be more accurate, want Scots to think they are. We are not . Considering we have oil revenue missalocated as unknown to name just one little trick you Tories play. #Offyourknees
3440 2018-08-22 18:35:48 My dad got out his belt and a big fat cane I had never seen. I was flogged senseless, while I reeked of smoked fish oil. After crying for many hours, my mum gave me fanta chapman to recover. To this day, me and smoke fish play tag, it's a case of who hides better.
3441 2018-08-22 18:35:31 All- Obama ousted loggers and offshore oil rigs in his last couple days; earlier he sent the coal ind. to South America to "protect the environment."

I mixed up a batch of some stuff for my own toothache/gum problem, and it works pretty well.

Frankincense + myrrh in an airplane vodka bottle, + 1 drop of peppermint oil.

I should sell this. It works *instantly*!
3454 2018-08-22 18:34:00 And yet I see a picture of people all wearing clothes. Hmmm do they think the fabric fairy waves her wond and poof they appear?  Oil derivatives make those clothes and oil products bring them here, these protestors are hypocritical.

Im sure its mixed in our DNA ... 

Poison ??? Rubbish !!
3482 2018-08-22 18:31:47 My truck already needs an oil change:/
3483 2018-08-22 18:31:44 Saying oil revenues should not be used as a basis for independence. Is like saying that London and it's  financial services which account for 22% of UKs GDP should be discarded as it is not indicative of the whole of the UK.
3484 2018-08-22 18:31:42 This why Obama is keeping his head down?
3485 2018-08-22 18:31:41 This is how US took revenge from Hugo Chavis policy but installing its puppet who destroyed the oil rich country. Irony is, Venezuela has more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia.
3486 2018-08-22 18:31:39 A limitless flow of oil money floats a lot of political boats...
3487 2018-08-22 18:31:33 The biggest oil earning within a four year bracket was by the Jonathan's administration - $393billion. In the last three years, the Buhari administration has earned only $94billion in oil revenue; imagine the difference and still we've been able to do far more. ~ VP Yemi Osinbajo
3488 2018-08-22 18:31:24 hmm yet he and better together used the lie that oil was running out as a reason people should vote NO to independence !
3489 2018-08-22 18:31:15 Coconut oil is vile and people cooking with it should be ashamed of themselves.

3491 2018-08-22 18:31:07 Ah the old Oil Money take, eh? Have to rationalize however you need to in order to dull the pain, I understand. Since we’re doing old takes, Manchester is blue indeed, because there’s only one team that actually plays in Manchester. 
3492 2018-08-22 18:31:01 I feel like I’ve been smoking a pack of  unfiltered Marlboros everyday for the past week. What are the long-term health effects of this smoke?

3496 2018-08-22 18:30:33 One would think your producers would slow production growth until your pipeline bottle necks are corrected. I guess they like selling fractionally more oil for half as much.
3497 2018-08-22 18:30:31 Outstanding when you think that a  Babylonian in 1750 BCE would have had to labor 50hours to acquire #energy for an hour of light by oil lamp. By2018the labor required to buy an hour of light by #LED is less than a second in developed countries; a43,000-fold leap in affordability
3498 2018-08-22 18:30:29 Naltrexone is used in opiate withdrawal. Or overdose. I have been on suboxone for almost a year to stay away from opiates. Been working good. If I had access to good quality cannabis oil I might be able to get off of it. It can be harder to get off than opiates.

3502 2018-08-22 18:30:17 1. Oil revenues don’t go to the government but to the oil companies 2. Tax is collected on profits not revenues 3. Profits are also offset by losses such as decommissioning. No tax take from the North Sea for 3 years.
3503 2018-08-22 18:30:16 Lmao. It's a Palm oil bottle
3504 2018-08-22 18:30:08 I agree. Shouldn't their government have done a better job at diversifying their economy. But really they could still be selling oil if they were able to operate their rigs... their production is dropping off a cliff.

3525 2018-08-22 18:26:07 Is it so difficult to understand that there is no way at all, that something like gold or oil or anything else that cannot be authenticated as being the actual original cannot be tied to crypto? It has no meaning, it has no enforcement if the asset is not indistinguishable
3526 2018-08-22 18:25:51 Glad I’m not on the side of hope but on the side of facts. Trump is the best and all my democrat friends agree. That’s why it’s fun to talk to people on Twitter that hope they’re right about Trump. Years and years is a long time for hope!
3527 2018-08-22 18:25:49 It’s one of my favourite things. The olive oil in the two days leading up to it.. not so much.
3528 2018-08-22 18:25:47 Oil rigs aren't what's hurting our beaches.  Now more than ever in California we need to become self sufficient when it comes to energy for the Golden State.
3529 2018-08-22 18:25:46 Keeping that news of the white American citizen strangling his pregnant wife and 2 toddler daughters and dumping them in an oil well down there on the ticker, for an audience that is lucky if they can read their own name.
3530 2018-08-22 18:25:45 Because the USA have imposed horrendous sanctions so they can snatch their oil! Do have a read before spouting tripe
3531 2018-08-22 18:25:32 I love making basil-infused olive oil. #basic
3532 2018-08-22 18:25:32 Next week: whaling is back. Clean whale oil will make America's street lamps burn bright again.
3533 2018-08-22 18:25:29 That's easy, avocado,bacon,chicken thighs,olive oil, and cheese
3534 2018-08-22 18:25:24 No. "Extra Virgin" Olive Oil lobby
3535 2018-08-22 18:25:14 Trump “What payment” 
Cohen “Cash...”
 T” check” (paper trail for trump international non campaign) 
Rudy- “tapes are altered we have to full transcript”

Sessions investigating Cohen on 4/24
Same day plea deal is arranged.

“Retainer” to MA 

Welcome to the show. Buckle up.
3536 2018-08-22 18:25:09 it is vile snake oil. It's just expensive vinegar
3537 2018-08-22 18:25:08 I can imagine! This isn’t an exact match, but you might find it an acceptable substitute. It has that chewy texture that halloumi does. I found brushing it with olive oil before grilling made a big difference.
3538 2018-08-22 18:25:08 I remember how Iraqi oil $$ was going to pay for THAT war. LOL How is this one going to be paid for?

Also, HTF is Erik Prince still being considered for anything with his Seychelles meeting now presumably under investigation?
3539 2018-08-22 18:25:02 Hey that's fair, if the GOP somehow gains seat in the House and Senate this November I will eat crowe and say that you were right and I was wrong.
3540 2018-08-22 18:25:00 How does one kill time while waiting for their ca’s oil change to be done
3541 2018-08-22 18:25:00 The rule of law is snake oil? #traitor
3542 2018-08-22 18:24:44 Coconut Oil is supposed to have the ability to burn off excess fat when sufficient exercise is done. Also fish helps in maintaining health
3543 2018-08-22 18:24:30 Probably trying to get stormy’s #
3544 2018-08-22 18:24:23 USA wants independence, y’all: “AMERICA F—K YEAH”
USA wants to fight itself for states rights, y’all: “AMERICA!!”
USA wants to invade other countries for oil, y’all, “I WANT AMERICA TO SIT ON MY FACE”
Black people protest police brutality, y’all: “That is absolutely unamerican”
3545 2018-08-22 18:24:20 More collusion. Cohen goose was cooked. Signing the agreement with these phoney campaign finance charges, that dont even have to be proved now, just to cast a cloud. 
More sleazy Clinton tactics.
3546 2018-08-22 18:24:17 Bio oil was just what my skin needed 
3547 2018-08-22 18:24:06 Measure five pinches of olive oil then bring to a boil.
3548 2018-08-22 18:24:05 Omega 3 Fatty Acids are suppose to boost memory. Fish Oil Capsules are a good source.
3549 2018-08-22 18:24:05 What's rose hip oil for? Or how does it help?
3550 2018-08-22 18:23:57 >Scramble in the kitchen for baking soda. Or, was that only for oil fires? You're not sure, but you're gonna try and save your couch.
3551 2018-08-22 18:23:54 May shea butter and coconut oil be blessed upon them.
3552 2018-08-22 18:23:53 For instance 550 barrels of oil would translate into: 
-11000 gallons of gasoline 
-6050 gallons of diesel
That’s with US Grade refineries.
Fun Fact: an Arliegh Burke class burns 24 barrels of fuel...PER HOUR 
So calm thy tits
3553 2018-08-22 18:23:47 Rosalie: Vamp speeds outside

*changes the oil and washes the car*

Carlisle: Im so sorry about that
3554 2018-08-22 18:23:46 Ah, see, their mistake was thinking they could do the socialism thing relying on their oil reserves - a highly volatile commodity.
3555 2018-08-22 18:23:46 People are already using Mollie Tibbets' murderer to attack Latinos. I wonder how y'all feel about the white man who strangled his pregnant wife & put his daughters in oil tanks. Don't make the death of a young college girl about brown people trying to live better. Thanks.
3556 2018-08-22 18:23:44 What if I'm afraid of global warming but also obsessed with oil tho?
3557 2018-08-22 18:23:30 A true american speaking...

Like in
"Thanks for keeping my gas prices low by bombing Iraq to rubble, killing 100.000+ people. I'm going to drive the 0.5 miles to walmart instead of walking there. 10 times a day. Who cares! We can pillage more free oil next year!"
3558 2018-08-22 18:23:25 I really need to learn how to change the oil in my car
3559 2018-08-22 18:23:25 With respect, the Great Awakening was accompanied by spiritual revival and reform. It was a spiritual movement, not a political one. Jesus did say that His kingdom is not of this world. The corruption found in both political parties are incompatible with God's kingdom.
3560 2018-08-22 18:22:53 Also it’s not acceptable to joke about oil spills, I’m very passionate about wildlife preservation
3561 2018-08-22 18:22:46 Must be really nice feeling your back and running oil over .
3562 2018-08-22 18:22:46 Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
Jas 5:14 KJV
3563 2018-08-22 18:22:26 Maybe @BBCGaryR or @macdonke could ask this person, who is supposed to act in Scotland's interests, why oil is a valuable resource for the UK, Norway, Saudi, Venezuela, US and even Denmark, but it's something which can't contribute to Scotland's wealth.
3564 2018-08-22 18:22:23 In 1962,S.Korea focused on Devt of basic industries eg fertilizer,cement,oil refinery,Iron sheet as well as promotion of Value added exports
3565 2018-08-22 18:22:08 The divine kings of cities and nations are produced by the Father training his sons to pour out the fresh oil from their bellies everyday for many years until the Kingdom is on earth by the anointing oil of God.
3566 2018-08-22 18:22:01 And ya gotta have oil. .... forget these cardboard diet drs....
3567 2018-08-22 18:21:52 What about baby oil?
3568 2018-08-22 18:21:50 Allegedly overheard.... Someone sold this professor a bottle of Coconut Oil,, but it contained Castor Oil... Professor tried cooking with this everyday... and the rest is history!
3569 2018-08-22 18:21:43 I accuse Colonel Mustard oil of committing the crime in the in the night with the knife!
3570 2018-08-22 18:21:42 Any debt is attributed by a debt ridden and wasteful Westminster and doesn't even take into account the £37b worth of oil that flows directly from oil wells pipelines to other countries.
As it doesn't come ashore here it isn't included as an export.
3571 2018-08-22 18:21:14 Saudi #Aramco's #oil production was 10.2 million barrels per day in 2017. The company exported 6.9 million barrels of crude oil per day last year.
3572 2018-08-22 18:21:09 Pero nada como verlos en el Lucas Oil. 
3573 2018-08-22 18:21:05 Hydro ads. I know it doesn't affect it, then you're going to get out of her ministry wrote to the Oil and Gas Commission are delighted 1/4
3574 2018-08-22 18:20:44 Thanks for proving my point. Oil needs to be replaced, the world is running out of oil, it's going to take 10yrs to replace it, HENCE why we need to start NOW. Yes you're right, we need to end coal which Canada sends to China & we don't need nuclear we're on 2 vault lines in BC.
3575 2018-08-22 18:20:40 Coconut oil is God’s gift
3576 2018-08-22 18:20:30 So a top nutritionist has said that coconut oil has a worse fat content than butter.

I laughed.

3577 2018-08-22 18:20:24 Ok you do you and archive this thread and come back and see me in January @MikayesFiona @Wrongsideofpar
3578 2018-08-22 18:20:23 You think that's the most important thing going on today?
None of your ND constituents want to know your stand on the GOP unindicted co-conspirator?
But oil....
3579 2018-08-22 18:20:22 welp, good thing i dont use coconut oil for my food. LOL
3580 2018-08-22 18:20:18 Maybe 7 or 8 lah. Oil cleanser, regular cleanser, scrub, essence, eye cream and a moisturizer hahaha
3581 2018-08-22 18:20:15 Attempting to set a price on carbon over the objections of Conservative-governed provinces is for the purpose of letting market forces reduce the use of fossil fuels. The Accelerated Capital Cost Allowance oil sands subsidies were phased out 2010-4.
3582 2018-08-22 18:20:12 She would have been alive today. If the US immigration law had been followed. That is all we need to know.

3584 2018-08-22 18:20:05 How many years did the Left tell us abt environmental reasons of why we don’t need a US pipeline? Well y did Biden’s son join a Ukrainian gas pipeline company’s board if its so morally bad? And that doesn’t help Dems’ argument about Bush chasing oil & energy when they’re doing it
3585 2018-08-22 18:20:03 That’s such a fair and even handed article. What ails Venezuela? Economic forces … an unlucky president in power when oil prices fell … some critics say perhaps Chavez bears some responsibility… but who can say?
3586 2018-08-22 18:19:59 Going by the old Trax stores and seeing how everything changed and how a shit company literally messed up so many peoples careers... man fuck express oil. Some really good guys lost jobs cause of y’all.
3587 2018-08-22 18:19:49 Usually I use a half packet of yeast, half a cup of water, a teaspoon sugar, a pinch of salt, a glug of oil and one cup of flour bc I’m one person 
3588 2018-08-22 18:19:39 Got more than I ever dreamed of with President Trump. If you don’t believe this then you don’t understand mathematics.
3589 2018-08-22 18:19:35 Most people in Asia cook with it, I mean set it on fire and heat the stove, that also has the lighter coconut oil/milk as an ingrediant.

3596 2018-08-22 18:18:59 and thank you - yes the coconut ice cream is delicious has the right balance of coconut flavour, creaminess and even a slight coconut oil taste - oh no you have got me feeling hungry...
3597 2018-08-22 18:18:50 Hand Scrub 
 Coconut Oil + Rose Petals  + Sugar
 Lavender Essential Oil + Coconut Oil + Sugar + Dried Lavender
3598 2018-08-22 18:18:44 Idk tbh but I have friends who do esthiology and they all have told me coconut oil does nothing for your facial skin, it’s waxy so it doesn’t soak through your pores and just sits on top of skin.
3599 2018-08-22 18:18:40 No one knows the actual oil reserves these 'state' run oil companies have understated to keep prices high or overstate when u need that cash investment.....
3600 2018-08-22 18:18:39 Marula oil feels so nice on my face but my glasses don't like it. 
3601 2018-08-22 18:18:37 If you have beef with a person, keep it between yall. No one else needs/deserves to suffer. Best way to settle is Turkish oil wrestling
3602 2018-08-22 18:18:36 Notice that when people report on oil related things. Spills, “transfers” to NK. They will use the descriptor that makes it sound the “biggest”.
-the spill was 13,400 gallons!!! (319 bbls)
-SK transferred 80 tons to NK!!! (550 bbls)

3609 2018-08-22 18:18:15 Canada is part of the UN and if I was them I would tell Saudi Arabia that if you been had one of our citizens I'll just blow your country up and take all your oil. Now I don't truly believe in strong-arming but man this becoming b*******
3610 2018-08-22 18:18:09 My dog won’t eat her food unless it has olive oil on it #spoiled
3611 2018-08-22 18:18:05 President Trump means to strip national forest and national parks of by fracing for natural gas and drilling for oil. But this can only be done with more leaking pipelines. And fouling the waters of our fish with heavy equipment.
3612 2018-08-22 18:18:04 @BrainRoaring Thanks for the RT! Bull trap for oil! All hedgies will need to sell. CL Oct'18 going down. China slowing. Europe slowing. LatAm is a mess. Crude can't stay up at these prices! Short CL! #China #LatinAmerica #crudeoil #bulltrap #hedgefunds

3617 2018-08-22 18:17:32 Apparently the oil prices were kept low due to this .. one theory was discussed two years back .. don't know how correct it was
3618 2018-08-22 18:17:18 We've historically ended the final weekend of August. We do, however, have motorcycle races and the @Lucas_Oil Late Model Nationals pres. by @caseysgenstore in September.
3619 2018-08-22 18:16:56 Hahaha no joke go to Holland and Barrett and ask for CBD oil, it’s a component of weed but it doesn’t get you high, it’s legal and the best painkiller you could get, I’ve used it before, promise you it’ll help!! And get a joint whilst you’re at it 
3620 2018-08-22 18:16:53 An American,  husband to a pregnant wife and father of 2 beautiful little girls, murdered and dumped his family in a well of oil in Colorado. Sadly, this is not rare, it happens all too frequent now with white men.
3621 2018-08-22 18:16:50 Every time you fill up with E30 you reduce American dependence on foreign oil and support your local economy and farmers!
3622 2018-08-22 18:16:42 Thanks for providing that. No campaign contributions mentioned anywhere
3623 2018-08-22 18:16:40 나는 뼈레즈러다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3624 2018-08-22 18:16:38 Hey Cardboard Cutout Man, when will you release your Indiana emails?  When will you cleanup your family’s oil spill from all their leaky gas stations throughout the Midwest? When will you finally be implicated in Trump Crimewave?

3626 2018-08-22 18:16:27 Newport museum does not put any artwork on permanent display, I tried to donate the original oil painting of David “Bomber” Pearce from 1985

3627 2018-08-22 18:16:25 @auldcove Off shore tax account,oil as never bought success to the masses only the few have benefited?
3628 2018-08-22 18:16:24 I sure a lot of democrats said the same thing about the Ken Starr in the 90's. The president has been accused by his personal lawyer, with evidence to back it up, of committing a felony. It's not going to end well for Trump or the GOP.
3629 2018-08-22 18:16:22 Because it is very hard to find something better than oil. It would be better to FIRST target coal. It can be “easily” replaced with natural gas or nuclear.
3630 2018-08-22 18:16:22 Dear #Iowa,

3637 2018-08-22 18:15:52 Were those insurgents sent to Venezuela? I don't recall messing with them specifically. 

On oil, I don't know how much power the US has compared to OPEC. And these days we actually want higher prices so shale is viable. OPEC has been suppressing to a point.
3638 2018-08-22 18:15:47 In Malaysia, the national oil company (Petronas) oversaw and approved all of our proposals and activities. They were real engineers that knew their stuff very well. A form of industry regulation. In Denmark, the regulation was little more than a costly rubber stamping exercise.

3648 2018-08-22 18:15:18 Need to be careful when considering alternative medical treatment as plenty of high priced snake oil out there. Sad to see patients spend thousands on that just to avoid seeing a real doctor.
3649 2018-08-22 18:15:12 Oh ye of little Faith.. Trump is Cyrus .. The others are puppets.. Read the Bible God Wins.. The Dems are dead men and women walking.. Welcome to the new revolution and the Great Awakening.. Your watching the greatest movie of all time
3650 2018-08-22 18:15:00 Liquid coconut oil or grape seed oil also work well and are good for the skin. Along with exfoliation they can help to reduce razor burn   (if that's something you have an issue with)
3651 2018-08-22 18:14:58 US/Saudis have protection for oil agreement in place which is exactly like it sounds.
3652 2018-08-22 18:14:52 i make coconut oil with abv and the first time I "tested" a batch I ate a teaspoon thinking it would be weak due to it being already vaped crumbles. Boy was I wrong!

3654 2018-08-22 18:14:38 Oh No, what will the billion or so people in Asia do who eat foods using coconut oil? oh no, what will Professor Michels advise the 80-90 year-olds on how to cook their food in coconut milk with peppers & shrimp paste? 
Oh No.
3655 2018-08-22 18:14:32 Why would the Saudi's cancel the IPO? Because they are making a lot of money from oil again? I don't get it.

3660 2018-08-22 18:14:07 Short CL Oct'18 @ 67.96.  BULL TRAP! From weekly chart, it seems like it will come back down to 66s. Range bound on a weekly chart. Breakout failure. #oilprice #Oil #Commodities #oilfutures #clfutures #oilfutures #oil_bulltrap
3661 2018-08-22 18:13:51 Still finalising the oil leak claim
3662 2018-08-22 18:13:33 Decades of destabilisation across Central America in material aid to insurgents. These days? Sanctions and lowering oil prices. 

Venezuelan government is a dictatorship though, let's be real.
3663 2018-08-22 18:13:25 Ngapain kak olip oil. .
3664 2018-08-22 18:13:01 I mean has to be part of it, no? Who would pay 2ish trillion for a company when they have no way of knowing how much oil is actually left.
3665 2018-08-22 18:12:54 Wash hands, apply neutrogena cleaning oil and melt all makeup except mascara off, wipe of cleansing oil with makeup wipes. I almost exclusively only wash my face in the shower because I want the steam. I let the water and stream break down my mascara so i don’t pull out lashes
3666 2018-08-22 18:12:49 Or just divest yourselves of Scotland since we’re such a fiscal drain. Go on we dare you. Then watch as you run out of the water we send you, the electricity we send you and the taxes and oil we send you. I’d give you six months on your own
3667 2018-08-22 18:12:45 CBD oil has made my anxiety worse, but I have heard others have great success. Great idea!!
3668 2018-08-22 18:12:42 When you make lound coconut oil, test each new batch especially if you think a particular batch might be "pretty strong"
3669 2018-08-22 18:12:41 #Gers is fake news! We are given a block grant we live within our means therefore no deficit! Trident & warmongering should be attributed to WM! As for Oil just look at Dubai in 1970s & now says it all!
3670 2018-08-22 18:12:39 It’s good it was apparently thwarted, now someone has to convince our President that his buddy Putin is still trying to meddle, and is someone who can not be trusted. We just caught him selling oil to North Korea, in violation of Trumps own sanctions.  He is NOT a good guy!
3671 2018-08-22 18:12:35 When dems take the house this nov, and everything else in 2020, remember, you could've had Cruz, Walker, or Rubio. You could've gotten everything you wanted, the ACA repealed, conservative judges, tax cuts, but you had to choose Trump.
3672 2018-08-22 18:12:28 There was a time I filled my mum's 10ltr tin can of oil with soap water from washed clothes. Guess what she did when she returned that day. 

After emptying the can, she beat me up with it leaving an indelible scar on my head . I'm a survivor of childhood.
3673 2018-08-22 18:12:17 You are a RITUALIST!
3674 2018-08-22 18:12:15 Moderation is the key , our body needs saturated fat too, it's very important for your manhood, it increases testosterone level, 1teaspoon on daily basis is perfect, rest you can use olive oil, or other source of good fat,

3677 2018-08-22 18:12:09 Not since oil outclassed it.

3679 2018-08-22 18:12:00 At the Colorado Oil & Gas Assn. conference in Denver, GOP nominee for #cogov Walker Stapleton says it's "inconceivable" to get to 100% renewable energy by 2040, saying CO doesn't need "top down mandates. Polis has called his plan "not a top-down mandate."

3681 2018-08-22 18:11:51 You are a lying toad. Too wee too small. The only country in the world that couldn't look after itself. My god what is the point of Scotland then Adam? A financial basket case even with huge oil reserves? Let's just shut the gates.
3682 2018-08-22 18:11:50 Blair was a snake oil salesman who would sell his own family for power. I don't want that but I don't think the choice is as binary as that. Just some awareness that he makes life easy for his opponents would be a start.
3683 2018-08-22 18:11:47 @realDonaldTrump As I asked you several times not to pollute nor allow such pollutions,look at all weather crisis's world is experiencing,yet you not bringing creations I have awaiting to save world,yet you work against allowing oil drilling&burning coal etc while world dying etc
3684 2018-08-22 18:11:46 Iran has an authoritarian regime that oppresses its people and supports communities of co-religionists in various countries with money and weapons. So does Saudi Arabia. Why are we buds with KSA and hate Iran?

I guess KSA has more oil and Iran competes on natural gas exports.
3685 2018-08-22 18:11:44 don’t put coconut oil on ur burn if it’s blistering up! use aloe instead~ if your burn isn’t that bad, you can use coco oil to moisturize!
3686 2018-08-22 18:11:36 100% agree! Well I’m still eating it. And if this means the price in coconut oil will go down then I’ll buy even more!
3687 2018-08-22 18:11:35 Coconut Oil is the only food which contains Lauric Acid after Mother's milk. It can absorb within mouth which provides maximum immunity to an individual. 
Natural medicine to diabetes, cough, allergy, obesity!
3688 2018-08-22 18:11:26 You pointed out one (who else is going to fund it? Turbine companies? Oil/gas?) but said nothing about the one funded by the power company itself. Again, nice deflection. I doubt you'd find the peer review acceptable anyway. Focus on credentials. The research is up to you..

3691 2018-08-22 18:11:03 Did you have these same concerns when Fort McMurray Alberta was burning 2 years ago? I bet you were cheering because this is the place that dirty oil comes from.
3692 2018-08-22 18:11:02 I agree. I cook so I exactly know how tough it is to use little to no oil.. I can't cook diet food - never tried 
3693 2018-08-22 18:11:00 Also my friend once gave me these peppermint oil IBS tablets which helped sooth my digestive system after a particularly bad reflux episode so if you have anything peppermint in your house

3696 2018-08-22 18:10:39 So his campaign didn’t give the payout now what?
3697 2018-08-22 18:10:27 Additionally if we are such a "burden" why don't they allow us to become independent and that ends the "subsidy"! They won't because the trillions of debt (loans) are secured against the oil (Scotland's oil).

3703 2018-08-22 18:09:49 It can be poisonous for American weather condition, not poisonous for Indians & Indian weather condition.
Harvard University must have got some project by American brand oil to promote their brand in India.
3704 2018-08-22 18:09:47 Deciding on an oil change? Don’t go to Jiffy Lube. Total joke! They give the lamest lube job and their oil can’t be used on fries. Go to DuPont Citcle and ask for my pal Sergi. #TrumpYelpReviews

3706 2018-08-22 18:09:35 she is. Friends come home asking her to make diet food. But then she is a good cook & also has tenacity. She ensures i stick to diet. 
But honestly cooking is the biggest problem. Most people cannot cause food tastes yuck. To make all food in 1 tea spoon of oil is talent
3707 2018-08-22 18:09:26 Left my headphones in my car. Now I can’t listen to music while waiting for an oil change.

3723 2018-08-22 18:07:31 Mostly you will have to eat cheese, eggs, fish, lamb and some vegetables fried in coconut or olive oil. Avoid rice or eat little. No idlis, dosas or bread. Grilled chicken will become your staple diet.
3724 2018-08-22 18:07:30 Looking for a natural hair spa  in the oil city... Need to switch things up you know... Pls help a sis out...
3725 2018-08-22 18:07:29 Fluctuations in oil price rarely a handicap to other developed states.  The UK the only one that seems to have ballsed up the process and frittered income away. Also odd economists find Scots oil benefits UK economy but deemed a handicap for iScotland despite smaller population.
3726 2018-08-22 18:07:28 It can be poisonous for American weather condition, not poisonous for Indians & Indian weather condition.
By the way which oil brand Harvard want's to promote in India.

3730 2018-08-22 18:07:15 getting my oil checked tomorrow 
3731 2018-08-22 18:07:11 We have no borrowing powers so how can we run a deficit. Could it be our tax goes to London, we get a fraction back, our exports classed as leaving England and our poor oil tax which results in revenue flows as a credit to Westminster treasury as 'Unkown Regions'
3732 2018-08-22 18:07:09 It’s an oil widely used in Southern India for years and years. Everything is in moderation and so many pieces of research contradicting each other. I can’t keep up!
3733 2018-08-22 18:07:08 The people at the car place make me feel so dumb, like sir can you please just change my oil idk 
3734 2018-08-22 18:07:06 "Likely be appropriate to raise soon"

- not easy to be that vague in so few words

Fed would be nuts to keep going with oil where it is and mild inflation
3735 2018-08-22 18:07:04 It has gone a full circle already.

Early 2000’s Coconut Oil was a disaster for heart.

A decade later it was the new wonder oil, which certainly started affecting the “Healthy” Olive Oil market.

Now Olive Oil makers strike back, with a vengeance, by demonizing Coconut Oil again
3736 2018-08-22 18:07:00 Both Oil and Indian Currency not in our control but some player winning a medal is because of aggressive leadership of Modi !

Blindness ReDefined
3737 2018-08-22 18:06:59 Falso: Rokefller creó un producto homogéneo, que no estallaba, creó un petróleo estándar, por eso llamó a su empresa “ stadard oil”.  Él creó oleoductos y abarató costos y los competidores pidieron que se interviniera en su contra .
3738 2018-08-22 18:06:56 Getting an oil change is the worst. They make it sound like my car is gonna blow up any second.

3741 2018-08-22 18:06:40 It is no longer the wealth of oil but wealth of data! Someone got it longtime ago ! 
3742 2018-08-22 18:06:28 Then there should be no south India on indian map here every one use coconut oil for cocking & drinking it's water. Harvard se to @RahulGandhi bhi pass out hain kispe vishwash Karu sir aap hi batao..!!
3743 2018-08-22 18:06:21 Translation: money and kowtowing to oil companies is more important than the environment. Trudeau fiddles while BC burns.

3747 2018-08-22 18:05:59 Doesn't make sense for a Dem, an MD, so called environmentalist to bow to the oil industry if there wasn't something up. Union Hill? You're supporting the risk from the compressor in a Black community, many descendants of freed slaves? Doesn't add up, folks. Something's rotten.
3748 2018-08-22 18:05:40 That oil belongs to the ancestors of the dinosaurs that died to make it!

3752 2018-08-22 18:05:11 Reading the McCrone report in depth is not a warning about Scotland with oil , its a warning of Westminster without Scotland.

3764 2018-08-22 18:03:32 Apologies for butting in. I read that you must make sure the bowl and beater have no trace of oil or grease from previous recipe. And no trace of soap from washing up. And isn’t plastic. Might any of those help??

3772 2018-08-22 18:02:58 False
3773 2018-08-22 18:02:56 Hydraulic oil is good for the eyes, right?
3774 2018-08-22 18:02:49 It's been like this for years. The auto industry and the oil industry have always lobbied hard to keep the requirements to obtain a licence as lax as possible. More drivers = more cars = more oil consumption. As they say, just follow the money.
3775 2018-08-22 18:02:42 It's rather myopic and fearmongering to target one type of oil. The heart associations in North America have been so off in their food messaging. Keep it simple. Focus on whole foods rather than single nutrients like saturated fat. The brilliant @DougCookRD may have more to say.
3776 2018-08-22 18:02:37 He is right. And he meant this to the chemical oil industry
3777 2018-08-22 18:02:37 You can’t fault Trudeau for foreign oil.. how long has Canada been using foreign oil?
A lot longer then Trudeau has been PM
Time to change that.. absolutely 
But you can’t pin the FO on him
3778 2018-08-22 18:02:32 You know who killed his own kids, hid their bodies in an oil drum, and then strangled his wife? 

American white guy. Bad people are of every nationality. Just felt like I should mention that.

3782 2018-08-22 18:02:21 Remember to eat healthy fats daily e.g. avocados, nuts, seeds, fish, coconut oil, butter.

Contrary to popular belief natural fats aren't bad for you, in fact your body needs fat to survive.

But watch it. It can be easy to eat too much if you're generous with your carbs as well.
3783 2018-08-22 18:02:19 Yea I don’t like food cooked in coconut oil at all! It’s very.....coconuty. Sad about what happening Kerala  heartbreaking to see that beautiful place and wonderful people in that situation

3789 2018-08-22 18:01:55 Yes, Trump's organization used fake invoices and committed fraud to pay Cohen back. Allen Weisselberg, Trump's CFO, knows where all of the figurative bodies are buried. If Trump was laundering Russia money, then Weisselberg was involved in it and Trump is in more legal trouble.
3790 2018-08-22 18:01:51 Still not sure why, I have trouble believing the secrecy arguement here because it wouldn’t have taken them 2.5 years to figure that out. Is it because oil prices are higher and they don’t need to sell anymore?
3791 2018-08-22 18:01:47 $$REWARD$$ 
RELEASE SPONGEBOB!!
FREE OIL CHANGE to anyone that can provide information leading to the safe return of SpongeBob!!

3792 2018-08-22 18:01:37 Nah.  I'm thinking something more like chicken tenders, mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, with a side of sliced tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and seasonings.  Uhhh, what time do you serve dinner? 
3793 2018-08-22 18:01:34 Location unrelated but problem the same - VP Pence while governor of Indiana and his oil company ‘issues’ of uncleaned sludge.... Have fun!!!

3795 2018-08-22 18:01:26 Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; so does the sweetness of a friend's counsel that comes from the heart.   Proverbs 27: 9 (NIV)
3796 2018-08-22 18:01:25 At PMQ's at the end of last year Theresa May said that Oil was a Valuable Resource for the Country (UK).Why should it be different for Scotland.

3800 2018-08-22 18:01:06 Although it was more administration related. It happened under warren g Harding. Bribery that involved bribery and leasing of navy oil reserves to private company without open competition.
3801 2018-08-22 18:01:04 I will never forget a similar incident that happened to me. A cop arrested me for using a phone while driving near Parklands. It was an emergency so i had no choice but to do the call. He wanted me to bribe him and i refused. I ended in Milimani...paid 5k. I left ready to bribe!
3802 2018-08-22 18:01:00 Your shareholders might justifyably enquire why you disposed of your oil company before choosing to go down this route.
3803 2018-08-22 18:00:57 The one mistake he made, was to rely solely on oil and running an external deficit in dollars.
3804 2018-08-22 18:00:44 So good! Fry off garlic in olive oil then add borletti beans or cannelloni beans and mash as they fry slightly. You can add a touch of mustard or cheese at the end.... so much tastier than normal mash too
3805 2018-08-22 18:00:42 Would be his highest achievement to my knowledge
3806 2018-08-22 18:00:41 Some sort of aromatherapy diffusion oil product at this pharmacy labeled "No More Thieves"? Is "area denial weapon" the implied use case?
3807 2018-08-22 18:00:41 The whole Jamie Oliver rice thing is funny but guess what? How many of us are attempting to own and control what is ours? Whether that be the seasoning we put on our  food or the wigs we wear on our  head or even the hair oil we put in our hair
3808 2018-08-22 18:00:37 Most emulsion is water based so the primer needs to be water based. If you use oil based primer and water based emulsion the emulsion won’t stick to the primer as water and oil don’t mix

It’s tough to see glowing skin if its covered in thick patches of hair, so apply some baby oil to your toes, legs and the top of your feet and then shave.

3831 2018-08-22 17:58:35  She actually caused it. What they call Groundnut oil & palm oil is kindov similar in Hausa language & with the Hausa name she sent me on errand with. I reach there confused. I freestyle with anyone come back house. i cannot kill myself 
3832 2018-08-22 17:58:35 I love toasted sesame oil to bits in cooking~
3833 2018-08-22 17:58:16 That implies that you can purchase goods in Venezuela. The only product in stock seems to be oil, cheaper than water and smuggled to the neighboring countries for food.
3834 2018-08-22 17:58:15 Great idea. I now have visions of wave patterned oil cloth (pvc) backing for my working wall, with my kids faces on little divers... 
3835 2018-08-22 17:58:14 Bought the “Wants” palette blindly. This will be my first Revolution purchase.

3836 2018-08-22 17:58:12 Is the primer oil based or water based ?
3837 2018-08-22 17:58:12 I like my pizza sliced, covered in oil, enough that when you fold it and hold it upside down the oil drips off.

3840 2018-08-22 17:57:42 Crude oil trading at $67.35 and natural gas @ $2.98 . I'm expected to see a 50-100% during a 12-24 months period as the market moves towards a sellers market. @myJPSonline with say trading at $6 how the light would look?

3844 2018-08-22 17:57:15 I just remember going to the stores to find Italian food products. Olive oil and noodles and a pizelle iron for my daughter. Grama made them by hundreds & y son ate them all, to her constant delight. She cooked like an angel. Even simple things were like made in heaven.

3852 2018-08-22 17:56:34 This is why you should run for president sir... We need someone who would invest what little oil money we have left on other capital projects.
We've seen it done in Cross river state, we want the same for this country.
3853 2018-08-22 17:56:31 The best part of the Tape was Trump asking for a Diet Coke 
3854 2018-08-22 17:56:29 Mr. Snake oil Salesman, Canada bought oil from the Saudis during your @stephenharper's entire regime. Oil existed in Western Canada at time. So quit the BS about pinelines and the absurd concept of free market, which as it turn out, you understood very very little.
3855 2018-08-22 17:56:28 He’s seen the error of his ways, which is a good thing. The fact is, Chavismo worked very well for the first 15 years, & very badly for the subsequent 4 years (coinciding precisely with a global oil glut & US sanctions). You have no idea where Venezuela will be 4 years from now.
3856 2018-08-22 17:56:23 So the Conservative and Unionist argument (supported by an uncritical state broadcaster) is that the price of oil fluctuates so its a bad thing. 
Who believes this shit any more?
3857 2018-08-22 17:56:21 @dpradhanbjp Sir ur one of the worst performing minister . Undeserving too . In place of checking the rising oil n gas price . Ur department comes with bizarre requirements . If u wish to grant RPL what is the need of Aadhar, caste , religion, residing Lok Sabha data.

3860 2018-08-22 17:56:09 Yes, it's a felony when you don't report a campaign contribution and try to cover it up. The penalty is a couple of years of jail time.
3861 2018-08-22 17:56:08 I get excited (moderately) when I can cook dinner all in one pan. Kale, kielbasa, and onions in wild mushroom and sage olive oil. #adultingsohard
3862 2018-08-22 17:56:05 wear your seatbelt, change your oil, check your engine, check your battery, why AWD on the highway, dont take pics and drive! 
3863 2018-08-22 17:56:01 Roasted Chickpeas taste great on hummus, in wraps, on salads or on their own! 

1. Rinse and dry a can of beans, place on a baking sheet
2. Drizzle olive oil 
3. Sprinkle salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, cayenne generously 
4. Roast in a pre heated oven at 400 for 20 minutes
3864 2018-08-22 17:55:58 Saudi Arabia is building $300M solar city. Saudi Arabia! The land of oil energy is building solar. Don't mine for an energy source (uranium) in Grand Canyon. If Saudi Arabia can do it Arizona can do it. Build solar. Tell Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar to stop HR 520 NOW!
3865 2018-08-22 17:55:37 ehh, sounds a bit like click-baity brand of scientist.  (And I very rarely use coconut oil).
3866 2018-08-22 17:55:35 @RaTrade @michael_therami They will shelve it. I've invested in oil for 20 years. Important enough to still cause wars and topple governmts.
3867 2018-08-22 17:55:30 Cookery Tip #237  when cooking Kale use some coconut oil as it makes it slide easier into the bin

3872 2018-08-22 17:55:09 thinking of potato chips as simply “old oil held together by a potato” helps me to not eat them. sometimes.

3876 2018-08-22 17:55:00 Also, You can find an article about how a Tesla is obviously more energy conscious and environmentally friendly than an oil/gasoline vehicle... UNTIL you need to dispose of it. The waste from that is far more catastrophic than a gas vehicle’s entire lifetime’s worth of waste.

3880 2018-08-22 17:54:34 Your argument isn’t even based in economic reality. The fact Venezuela provides oil to the US has nothing to do with the fact that it’s citizens live in horrific conditions due to socialism.
3881 2018-08-22 17:54:30 That's irrelevant, unless you can prove your claim then there is no point in citing a website that does not exist.

Also, Jerry Brown is an Oil Mogul, Oil runs California.

3905 2018-08-22 17:52:41 Bio Oil is definitely one of the biggest scams out there
3906 2018-08-22 17:52:33 Theresa May said at PMQ's at the end of last year that Oil was a valuable resource for the Country (UK)...not for Scotland though.
3907 2018-08-22 17:52:30 hopefully oil prices will not be artificially propped up
3908 2018-08-22 17:52:29 If Saudis start trading oil in other currencies,it will hurt US economy. It's why we back KSA no matter how brutal they are. Nixon's deal with the devil. -4
3909 2018-08-22 17:52:24 soon there will be war in the middle east, RUSSIA, IRAN AND TURKEY SIGNED A PACT. THEY NEED ISRAELI OIL IN THE GOLAN. ITS HUGE.
3910 2018-08-22 17:52:21 On a general note: Unsaturated oils are bad. Saturated fats in coconut oil promote good health.

When I say oil, I mean oil that has been extracted from its source.
3911 2018-08-22 17:52:19 Does your car always light up when certain parts of your car need feeling i.e engine oil, coolant etc
3912 2018-08-22 17:52:15 Norway extraction costs are much less than UK for North Sea oil. The article fails to say this. It is biased.

3920 2018-08-22 17:51:43 A car won't just break down and stop from not being serviced, it will wear down major parts of the engine which a service is meant to protect, smoke, cost more fuel, oil and water to run and eventually break a major component that is expensive to repair.

3930 2018-08-22 17:50:35 i was surprised to see coconut oil so high up the klondike bar ingredients list, but i can really taste it
3931 2018-08-22 17:50:33 That means Indians have strong immunity to withstand poison as well....coconut oil hs been used for cooking for long and yes it's tasty too..this professor suffers frm psychosis i guess

3933 2018-08-22 17:50:24 Why not? Westminster has been bleeding Scotland dry of it's oil revenues for decades. If it's good enough to pay for things in Londone it's good enough to pay for things in Scotland.
3934 2018-08-22 17:50:17 i use coconut oil
3935 2018-08-22 17:50:03 Who needs hairspray when you don’t wash your hair for five days and it magically stays in place thanks to the copious amounts of oil on your head!!

3937 2018-08-22 17:49:59 I’m really bad about getting my oil changed.

NO MORE
3942 2018-08-22 17:49:50 Article 1: Coconut Oil is incredibly good for you, it cures everything.
Article 2: Coconut oil is incredibly bad for you, it might even kill you.

3943 2018-08-22 17:49:47 My art teacher today used his forehead oil to further explain what Dynamic Art is...
3944 2018-08-22 17:49:46 I might suggest it’s because those that want to ban oil and gas are “keep it in the ground” activists versus local residents that have concerns over process. Two very different groups of people.

3952 2018-08-22 17:49:23 Scot Gov spends 42% of Scottish Budget & WM spends 58%, a significant proportion of Oil Rev is not allocated to Scotland (admitted by WM Gov). You can verify these facts if you want to. So I wonder if Scotland really benefits in th way your claim. p.s. your numbers are also wrong
3953 2018-08-22 17:49:21 They're tapes of Trump telling Cohen to pay off stormy. The fact that he used fake invoices to pay Cohen back isn't exculpatory evidence, the opposite in fact.

3956 2018-08-22 17:49:08 Just wanna be on a beach, with loads of Oil on,a cocktail in my hand, eyes closed soaking up the sun.. is that too much to ask
3957 2018-08-22 17:49:05 YES!!! Peppermint Essential Oil. rub it on your temple or even your forehead (be sure to not get it near your eyes it burns). You can even apply it to your wrists. I’ve also taken a bath with epsom salt mixed with the peppermint oil & lavender oil. It helped too :-)
3958 2018-08-22 17:48:52 Aramco was state owned oil company. They were thinking of offering stocks in the company. As 2 what it means-could b interesting. Russia was very,very interested in acquiring stock. Royals met w Putin,very friendly. Maybe US put pressure on? -1

3960 2018-08-22 17:48:22 I remember! Coconut oil was supposed to be the WORST thing ever. People need to remember that researchers are human beings. With human biases and motives and whole heap a politics. I have so many back stories to tell.

oil price pretty obviously matters

tho waiting to see a turn in the actual data in places like Argentina and turkey
3976 2018-08-22 17:46:55 Absolute bullshit.... there are generations of people who have been using coconut oil even for cooking and all are well with normal life spans. What a useless fellow.
3977 2018-08-22 17:46:53 Yes, focus on helping people who are here illegally. In a perfect world for Warren this guy would be safely tucked away in a sanctuary city free to kill more white people.

3979 2018-08-22 17:46:50 Speaking of not your narrative have you been tweeting with outrage about the white Texas guy who killed his wife, and dumped his two daughters in a barrel of oil? No. Because you are a fear monger who thrives on racism. This murderer’s status is a non-issue. Violence is the issue
3980 2018-08-22 17:46:47 I didn’t realize oil changes took over an hour  fucking annnnnoyed
3981 2018-08-22 17:46:43 I don’t agree that coconut oil is pure poison, but I don’t use it that often. My preferred cooking fats are ghee, avocado oil, and evoo.
3982 2018-08-22 17:46:19 Finally, all the UK wide companies paying tax to Uk treasury would begin paying tax to Scot treasury & of course the big one, all Scot food, drink, Oil & Gas exports would be classed as Scottish not just our population share! That deficit would disappear quickly! 4/4

3985 2018-08-22 17:45:50 They should find anyone hawking snake oil supplements suspect.
3986 2018-08-22 17:45:50 The U.S. has the superior position, enhanced by @realDonaldTrump's energy policies. The squeeze on Iran will force concessions, or consequences. Addressing the EU's dependence on Russian Oil & Gas, denying Russia's use of the energy weapon enhances that strategic theater as well.
3987 2018-08-22 17:45:38 Have you been tweeting with outrage about the white Texas guy who killed his wife, and dumped his two daughters in a barrel of oil? No. Because you are a fear monger who thrives on racism. This murderer’s status is a non-issue. Violence is the issue
3988 2018-08-22 17:45:35 Page 16, #37 of the Cohen plea document proves there's no campaign violation in black and white.

3991 2018-08-22 17:45:11 that the husband who just killed and buried his wife and two daughters in oil drums wasn't an illegal immigrant! The hundreds of priests who abused innocent children were not illegal immigrants!

3994 2018-08-22 17:45:08 I know. Perhaps before when the traitor Bush took office. He sold us out for his family oil. :(
3995 2018-08-22 17:44:59 It's all about greed and oil they won't stop killing because of greed we see it here in America.
3996 2018-08-22 17:44:56 All modern technology relies upon fossil fuels. Healthcare cannot function without oil.

4001 2018-08-22 17:44:29 I wish I could keep oil company
4002 2018-08-22 17:44:29 Ah the oil. GERS includes the oil. The oil is highly dependent on the price of crude, and the UK's oil is the most expensive in the world to extract. More expensive that Norway's and they produce twice as much as we do.
4003 2018-08-22 17:44:28 I changed the oil in my 4Runner today, exactly 2000 miles after I changed it on the same day last year.  Total coincidence.

4006 2018-08-22 17:44:21 Wet your hands & take a *small* amount of hand lotion or moisturizer (or beard oil if you feel like being fancy ) and rub it together & rub it all over your beard area 1-2 times a day. The water\oils get absorbed by the skin & hair, helping with the dryness immediately. 
4007 2018-08-22 17:44:17 I couldn't be sponsored by Scent Crusher. I just can't act like that snake oil works.

4009 2018-08-22 17:44:11 Putting coconut oil in your coffee or smoothie? People cook with it because it renders less carcinogens when heated.
4010 2018-08-22 17:44:06 Malayalis in particular. I had Kannadiga colleagues who would turn their noses at any dish cooked in coconut oil. On this matter, they stood united with the Naarthies.

If I had 24 hours electricity, I would eat fresh tomato stew all year round.
I would make avocado oil for consumption and would even export it! 
I would make groundnut oil too!
4013 2018-08-22 17:43:58 Larger volume of oil being removed maybe 
4014 2018-08-22 17:43:54 To compare same time data, SA's worst ever devaluation in history was 16.95 in Jan '16, the period you refer to. Tells you how global the oil shock was at the time. 
That we don't feel the pressure other EM countries are facing now from the surging USD is simply due to CBN FX mgt
4015 2018-08-22 17:43:49 We spend SO much time and resources into things that we do not need more of, including the oil, gasoline and the other emission industries instead of putting those resources into newer sources of energy to make them as efficient as we need them to be
4016 2018-08-22 17:43:47 For Indian cooking which is invariably at a high temperature, coconut oil is healthiest. 
Relatively ‘western’ food is cooked at low oil temperature and this statement may pertain to this fact.
4017 2018-08-22 17:43:47 Took my car in for an oil change. Go to pick it up and they didn’t even do it.  They did everything else for a 25k check up and we only wanted an oil change....now we have to wait....
4018 2018-08-22 17:43:42 I’m well aware of the biochemistry.
You’re prescribed it because you have a deficiency.
People without a deficiency don’t need additional B12.
People with cancer can’t cure it with vitamins.
Yet shysters sell them in that way. In that instance, vitamins are snake oil.
4019 2018-08-22 17:43:34 CBD oil is pretty great if you are stressed but it won't help you figure out the cause and resolution of your seizure. I hope you are feeling better
4020 2018-08-22 17:43:32 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
4021 2018-08-22 17:43:25 Looks like the flat in oil is complete. $80 next target?
4022 2018-08-22 17:43:23 There already is a pipeline from Alberta to Vancouver.  It has been there for over 60 years.  The new one is to get more oil to market. It benefits Canadians.
4023 2018-08-22 17:42:58 My family uses lard to cook but that thing needs to be really fresh or it'll taste horrible and ruin the food.  Olive Oil >>>>>>>>>>>
4024 2018-08-22 17:42:54 We do! Coconut oil is a very healthy oil, and I use it in cooking. It's especially important for us vegans. This study is one person's opinion; if you search you could find 30 studies showing the opposite. You know how these things work. Moderation is key with everything.
4025 2018-08-22 17:42:47 Coconut oil is healthy
4026 2018-08-22 17:42:41 فكرة المطالبين بغسل فروة الرأس و الشعر بدون شامبو  تعتمد على ان الشامبوهات الموجودة بكل أنواعها تضر الشعر و تضر الجسم على المدى الطويل وان مجرد غسل الشعر بالماء فقط او زيت شجرة الشاي(Tea Tree Oil) اوخل التفاح (cider vinegar )او السدر او الصبار كافى و أمن لتنظيف فروة الرأس و الشعر
4027 2018-08-22 17:42:40 lol....soon, there will be another study pointing out that coconut oil is actually good...we have seen this movie with coffee... :)
4028 2018-08-22 17:42:29 Nice to fantasize about it for a brief second. Then again, depends what any of the other teams are offering. Obviously no teams makes that deal without a contract agreement, but could the Oil afford two guys making $12M?
4029 2018-08-22 17:42:23 so I was thinking of like a marmalade/olive oil mix used as the sauce with fresh mozz, prosciutto, and shredded basil and thyme

4040 2018-08-22 17:41:20 To that end, I love playing the game: Is palm oil in this product?
4041 2018-08-22 17:41:16 Tomi Lahren is a bizarre homunculus made of shredded Brietbart scripts and Murdoch's fingernails, given life through the tears of Lincoln, and animated by the escaped spirit of a snake oil salesman.
4042 2018-08-22 17:41:16 We just have to stop sending our money to Westminster, and stop them stripping our assets while we're at it. Stop giving them our water, oil, and whisky revenue. GERS will suddenly mean a lot less to them and their baseless arguments.

4050 2018-08-22 17:40:52 It itches for 2 reasons: 1) your skin isn't used to the length of the new growth & it "tickles"\itches - time will take care of this on its own. 2) The skin isn't used to producing enough oil to stay "moist" *and* coat the hair, so the skin itches. (1\2)
4051 2018-08-22 17:40:50 Oh, so when I prove you wrong, you immediately pivot to "it's capitalism." 
So is selling snake oil.

4053 2018-08-22 17:40:34 Don't you think building the pipelines and opening our our oil to more markets would go a long way to help pay for fire management in your great province?

4065 2018-08-22 17:39:36 Boz watched an oil well in Oklahoma, for his summer job. Just sat there and watched it.
4066 2018-08-22 17:39:31 Jaribu. Next month tuwe na by-election! M7 will make sure you disappear! He is a bushman, and not threatened by stone-throwers like you!
4067 2018-08-22 17:39:23 i got a $69 oil change for $22.50 
4068 2018-08-22 17:39:23 Spark plugs are similar to motor oil, fuel filters, and air filters in that they require routine service and maintenance to keep your engine running strong.
4069 2018-08-22 17:39:23 Lemongrass, ginger, garlic, bell peppers, serranos, green onion, cilantro, a metric ton of basil. 
sauce is sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, honey, five spice
4070 2018-08-22 17:39:19 Not to forget other costs that are nothing to do with Scotland - HS2, London sewer improvements etc. Plus all income that's left out that they're "unable" to tack on to a specific region (I believe a large amount of oil is in there)
4071 2018-08-22 17:39:14 Like democrats used oil to bring its enemies to its by bringing it to 25 from 110 in six months reverse is happening as republicanism are taking it up
4072 2018-08-22 17:39:12 Maybe time to invest in oil (said the same thing last year before I bought real estate )
4073 2018-08-22 17:39:08 Had my carbonara ,soak myself in olive oil with my lotion , aloe on face.
Im good to go. 
4074 2018-08-22 17:39:06 Gymmie, any thoughts about the White father and husband, who murdered his family and dumped them in oil field? Do you only care if you can politicize a case? Also,  you need to resign. #rememberPaterno #rememberPennState
4075 2018-08-22 17:39:00 .@AJEnglish reporting Saudi Arabia called off the #aramco IPO listing, one of the world's largest unlisted oil corporation .Controlled by the Saudi monarchy.
Only reason one can think of is the recovery of oil price &Trump trying to weaken dollar which will put a floor under it.
4076 2018-08-22 17:39:00 Aja Kong beat Bull Nakano in a non-title cage match in 22:08. Both juiced early from the head. Somehow the oil can was in the cage and they mainly hit each other in the head with it. [10/90]
4077 2018-08-22 17:38:59 Hey, let's all have a "sleaze-off" competition between the two Michaels, the Creepy Porn Lawyer, Avenatti, and the Secret Taper Creep, Cohen!  Cast your vote on who's the slimiest! These two swamp creatures are why lawyers are catergorized just below snake oil salesmen. Ew, yuch!
4078 2018-08-22 17:38:58 Coconut oil should be patented as geographical patent. Not sure what it's called.
4079 2018-08-22 17:38:48 Right but too much, the Rolex oil cap, really?? But guess if you going go all out might as well.
4080 2018-08-22 17:38:47 #USD - if the US economy thrives, it will be impossible for the world to continue to price commodities, including oil, in dollars. The US will simply not export enough US dollars to meet the working capital needs of the rest of the world, as production will have relocated to US.
4081 2018-08-22 17:38:34 Our money relies on the oil industry mainly. So it’s gotten a bit slower but not as bad as some places. Everyone who goes on stage is paid a show price, tipping is made into a game. Bulk dances are pushed. They upsell at the cashier where the dances are tracked and timed.
4082 2018-08-22 17:38:28 Got my oil change, my baby driving so smooth rn
4083 2018-08-22 17:38:21 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face as moisturiser.
4084 2018-08-22 17:38:18 I saw a commercial last week for a cleanser with infused coconut oil. I cringed 
4085 2018-08-22 17:38:14 It’s like if oil and water couldn’t not stick to each other even though they’ll never mix.
4086 2018-08-22 17:38:12 Not the air in saudi its not. You actually inhale 80% oil vapour and 20% humidity. So its cancerous and suffocating. In every single meaning of the word.
4087 2018-08-22 17:38:09 You can get CBD oil at aromatic infusions!
4088 2018-08-22 17:37:59 finally washed the coconut oil out.. hair feels like a cloud she’s so healthy even after 5 bleaches
4089 2018-08-22 17:37:52 Extra virgin olive oil >>> coconut oil
4090 2018-08-22 17:37:48 @realDonaldTrump Since we will be coming to an end of this roller coaster of a Presidency soon, I want to thank you for time, even if it was nothing but misery for much of the world. I hope Mr.Mueller uses decency and oil when hes all in ya ass. #induetime 
4091 2018-08-22 17:37:48 “why do they call it a deep fryer, it’s actually pretty shallow!” I yell as I put my hand into the vat of boiling oil. I pull it out to reveal a perfect Golden Brown fist.

“eating good in the neighborhood” says the Applebee’s manager, as he adds my fist to the list of appetizers
4092 2018-08-22 17:37:45 A Colorado oil worker accused of murdering his pregnant wife and two young daughters showed little emotion on Tuesday when a judge read the charges at a hearing punctuated by sobs from the man's father-in-law. #notanimmigrant
4093 2018-08-22 17:37:45 Absolutely sir. Oil has been proped up for a variety of reasons. Oil industry is a big employer in USA. High prices ensured employment rather firing if prices were low. Helping Russia and other friends in a big way. USA themselves offloading there oil by imposing sanctions
4094 2018-08-22 17:37:44 Have someone take you to the auto store to buy wiper blades + air filter for 1/4th the price. An oil change can run you $45 if you YouTube it.
4095 2018-08-22 17:37:43 Credit cards in SD, oil revenues and taxes in SD
4096 2018-08-22 17:37:34 Read published paper by B M HEGDE Coconut Oil – Ideal Fat next only to Mother’s Milk
4097 2018-08-22 17:37:28 The 1st in a series of environmental public forums about the potential impacts of the Trump Admin’s proposed expansion of #offshore #oil drilling will be held at 7pm tonight at #NewportBeach City Hall. @KNX1070
4098 2018-08-22 17:37:19 actually fuck the ponytail skin i want her work skin like the oil smudges her jacket and hat and all that
4099 2018-08-22 17:37:14 This black organic castor oil I use everyday has my hair super thick  but it’s healthy 
4100 2018-08-22 17:37:11 Yup. Because somehow it's okay for Bernie to declare himself an Independent but then grift off the Democratic Party whenever it suits him. White male privilege is outrageous. He's a fucking snake oil salesman cut from GOP cloth.
4101 2018-08-22 17:37:08 is it legal to buy cannibas oil online?  the real question of today
4102 2018-08-22 17:37:08 Er... Nope...
“China takes a quarter of all Iran’s oil exports, and with Chinese banks little exposed to the US it can avoid the impact of Trump’s sanctions.”
4103 2018-08-22 17:36:59 I didn't see the part where she went to the Philippines & made the oil herself, fresh oil, where she would get a mature nut, drain the water, grate the meat, press the fluid, then boil it, and there is oil as opposed to copra oil, which is a different process.
4104 2018-08-22 17:36:52 (2) Oil price is clearly not responsible for collapse over 20 yrs but the chronic levels of theft, corruption, misappropriation & total lack of investment in #PDVSA etc by the tyrannical chavista regime meaning production has more than halved since 2011
4105 2018-08-22 17:36:50 I gave my conch a good tea tree oil soak and then a sea salt soak and it’s a little stingy I think that means I really infiltrated the swelling
4106 2018-08-22 17:36:48 JOSH "OIL TOT" FREAKIN MIDDLETON! YOU ARE TRULY THE BEST U.K. TEDDY BEAR I'VE EVER SEEN! Your a teddy bear at any age and that type of cuteness is truly the best one there is! All I can say from this is.....awwww!
4107 2018-08-22 17:36:47 If coconut oil is poisonous, then keralites should have died as they use only coconut oil in fact there is less case of heart disease in Kerala. All bullshit professor
4108 2018-08-22 17:36:30 How much of this oil should i smoke? I feel like i could wreck this whole thing today
4109 2018-08-22 17:36:28 I slathered myself in coconut oil and I am content with this tan

4111 2018-08-22 17:36:18 Abt to go get my oil changed 
4112 2018-08-22 17:36:06 Why not  ??? @thesnp based their whole economic argument on oil at  $113 a barrel .... it dropped to circa $30 and is now $72. You can’t base your whole economy on a commodity. Scotland would have been bust before Independence day !!!
4113 2018-08-22 17:36:01 With like 1 teaspoon of palm oil
4114 2018-08-22 17:35:59 All my new art is the fight against oil conglomerates, sea world, government farms, and energy conglomerates.
4115 2018-08-22 17:35:49 Snake oil sales talk at Oxford level... all talk and no spine... how British!
4116 2018-08-22 17:35:32 Moroccan oil, it's my blonde hair savior. No split ends, happy hair and smells beautiful. :) Also comes in a mini travel friendly size.
4117 2018-08-22 17:35:32 Thought I was the only one who would experience a thirsty scalp the next day after applying coconut oil
4118 2018-08-22 17:35:27 We've made good steps toward that, then. Ok. A little worried the Democrats want oil&coal bribes, tho
4119 2018-08-22 17:35:19 I love how people are freaking out about coconut oil.  It’s a solid at room temperature..it’s a saturated fat.  I learned in 8th grade that saturated fats weren’t good.  Like, get a clue people.
4120 2018-08-22 17:35:17 The best employment opportunity for those without a useful skill set is to become a mercenary. Therefore  promote that failure to the level of hero, and feed the oil wars multinational machine with the bodies of those the machine has abandoned in pursuit of profit. Brilliant
4121 2018-08-22 17:35:06 Best decision
The salafis need to be isolated and shunned
KSA has caused more misery in the world than any other nation
It's ideology of Wahhabism fueled by oil is the biggest curse of mankind
4122 2018-08-22 17:35:01 I guess despite the hot weather the government is all cuddly in bed with dirty oil companies
4123 2018-08-22 17:34:55 we overproduce oil and ship it out why do we need Saudi oil
4124 2018-08-22 17:34:52 one more piece of unsolicited medical advice, I'm blocking whoever gave it. 
there is a difference between "I'm sorry, maybe look into stress seizures," and "Just get cbd oil."
4125 2018-08-22 17:34:50 Hi Frank - I just read an interesting piece about how the cruise ship companies are doing the absolute minimum to reduce their emissions. Majority still burn heavy oil, not LPG. Atmospheric pollution is often off the scale in Venice.#MassTourism
4126 2018-08-22 17:34:37 “I think the importance of #Venezuela is it shows another way is possible. Obviously it’s got oil wealth which makes a difference, but nonetheless, they’ve sought to invest in the country and they’ve sought to continue to fight poverty.”  #Labour Party's  Diane Abbott
4127 2018-08-22 17:34:33 the Oil would have to also include one of their young defensemen as well IMO. No way Sens would go for it if it were just Draisaitl. Wonder if Karlsson has a list of no trade teams as well?
4128 2018-08-22 17:34:20 WITH ALL THAT OIL, they still can't afford socialism....
4129 2018-08-22 17:34:19 You are a party of nothing, believe in nothing, and stand for nothing. Your party encourages violence and demagoguery. You’re snake oil salesmen.
4130 2018-08-22 17:34:18 Correction, England takes 100% of our oil revenues, and hands back 8%, just imagine having  over 12 times more, like having a payrise of 12 times what you earn now
4131 2018-08-22 17:33:59 Of all possible attorneys, Lanny Davis, close friends with Hillary since Yale and major fixer of her many scandals now represents Cohen? It's a vicious game in their circles, they don’t want to lose control. Not buying the snake oil.
4132 2018-08-22 17:33:49 What you get...and what you casually describe is...oil given away for free (save for nominal licence fee) the UK generating £b's from the taxes which neatly are distributed around the UK using GVA.
4133 2018-08-22 17:33:40 butter milk chicken, walnut pieces, basil gremolata, truffle oil
4134 2018-08-22 17:33:37 So it's nothing to do with the US wanting to overthrow an elected government and steal Venezuelian oil?..and then just use it, like all the others, a vassal state?
4135 2018-08-22 17:33:29 Good to know.  Me?  Trouble and I are like oil and water.  It rolls off my back.
4136 2018-08-22 17:33:25 I take fish oil and krill oil for the DHA
4137 2018-08-22 17:33:25 & I'm an Oil Baron w 5 Qts in my Car..
4138 2018-08-22 17:33:13 Know what I mean though? Turned a lot of blind eyes in the 60s and 70s, while Bond at least was off killing foreign oil execs
4139 2018-08-22 17:33:07 @KimKardashian the entire hotel 'motel and my casino franchise and my oil and furniture and bedding and cookware and betoven " etc.. look it up'. Link everything associated with it'ake the arrest'.
4140 2018-08-22 17:33:06 Hope this diffuser and lavender oil could beat my insomnia
4141 2018-08-22 17:33:05 Banting is a diet with no carbs. You eat veggies, meat and good fats mainly avocado, coconut oil, olive oil. It’s also called LCHF=low carb high fat. There is also zero sugar as well as no fruit. Best diet for me. Google it for more info or email me
4142 2018-08-22 17:32:55 Among Iranians it’s called #iranbloodoil4eu Iran blood oil for EU.
4143 2018-08-22 17:32:55 And ammunitions and firepower and vehicles and maps and all other assets there by specific order of HUSSEIN OBAMA to be left there for use by ISIS (OR ISIL AS HE SO LOVINGLY PET-NAMED THEM) to take control of the most prosperous oil regineries to finance this operation that . . .
4144 2018-08-22 17:32:53 das Öl / oil
4145 2018-08-22 17:32:51 Which is why we’re always going to struggle in the top tiers. What we need is an unhinged oil billionaire to buy us and fund us to the heavens and back.
4146 2018-08-22 17:32:39 Yup Such an evil person. I saw he tried to blame his wife, saying she killed the kids so he killee her. Don't buy it. Why would you stuff your kids in an oil tank..ughhh
4147 2018-08-22 17:32:31 In fact coconut oil is used in Telangana and AP as an aid in weight loss. I have seen jawdropping results in a couple of my family friends. They lost more than 5 kgs in a month. This is working in the weight loss program.
4148 2018-08-22 17:32:24 it is a huge red flag for me when natural skincare products include coconut oil because it is super comedogenic for most skin types!
4149 2018-08-22 17:32:21 So just put your feet in hot tub for some time then massage ur feet with some oil,it may help.....btw to where?
4150 2018-08-22 17:32:17 @iansample Just read your coconut oil piece. Disappointed by such articles that uncritically endorse the nonsense about saturated fat and LDL
4151 2018-08-22 17:32:14 Thanks for this thread, appreciate it. People have been eating Coconut oil for hundreds of years if not more in many parts of the world. Unbelievable that so much research has been wasted by a @UniFreiburg @Harvard professor.
4152 2018-08-22 17:32:11 So take it a step further...a diet with a significant % of energy obtained from saturated fats like coconut oil does what to the different types of cholesterol?
4153 2018-08-22 17:31:58 I’m not even kidding, it wasn’t even 5 minutes after I left the oil change place. What. In. The. Actual. Fuck.
4154 2018-08-22 17:31:54 ...cash that check you received for supporting the oil and gas companies?? You know mitch...all they have to do is follow the money....bet it leads right to you!!!
4155 2018-08-22 17:31:45 Unemployment rate is low. GDP is growing. Non oil exports are getting higher. Wold class companies are jumping to get in our market.
4156 2018-08-22 17:31:41 I’ve had so many gyms where I can no longer go bc of EO. Yes, #essentialoils are natural. But for those of us with asthma or #allergic to that oil? It’s just not safe. I wish people would put up warnings before adding things to their air.
4157 2018-08-22 17:31:30 I actually jsut went through what I assume is the same exact shit for the past couple of months and now I’m back to 100% because I was swishing coconut oil twice a day for a couple of weeks
4158 2018-08-22 17:31:30 .Has anyone died consuming coconut oil?
4159 2018-08-22 17:31:26 The guy that killed his wife & kids. Left the little girls submerged in oil for a few days. What in the fuck is wrong with people!!!???
4160 2018-08-22 17:31:16 @NileshShah68 @KotakMF Dont buy mutual funds common man...this people looting your hard earned money..buy agriculture land,gold,oil,silver,aluminium..more over invest in land which has its true value, an intrenic value..invest in land.
4161 2018-08-22 17:31:08 we love a good liquid charcoal oil! i’m excited for this box wow.
4162 2018-08-22 17:31:00 China  will likely  ignore sanctions  and  buy  oil  in huge  quantities
4163 2018-08-22 17:30:51 This lady straight up said she hasn’t had an oil change in 9 years idk how her car still functions 
4164 2018-08-22 17:30:47 A super slimy snake oil salesman!
4165 2018-08-22 17:30:45 This continued obsession of oil wealth by #US/#UK & fellow accomplices of crime, somehow being more precious than human rights, international law. #Insanity.

4168 2018-08-22 17:30:14 It feels very much like "hey buy this collectors addition for the first year pass." This is snake oil.
4169 2018-08-22 17:30:10 Coconut oil chunks and throw up
4170 2018-08-22 17:30:08 My mom is considering buying cbd oil and now she thinks she's a rebel badass 
4171 2018-08-22 17:30:05 Electric cars are still powered by coal, oil and Site C. The answer is fewer private single-occupancy vehicles on the road.
4172 2018-08-22 17:29:55 I would never eat coconut oil. But I put it in my hair sometimes to treat dryness.
4173 2018-08-22 17:29:53 You could always redeem yourself with a regular issue sub. But you gotta have the bathtub and hot boiling oil as well.
4174 2018-08-22 17:29:48 The crude oil likely to stay between $50-70 and seems to stay in that horizon for half a decade least,if supply cuts are not easing.
4175 2018-08-22 17:29:48 sure! 6 anchovies, a big clove of garlic, 2 egg yolks, juice of 1/2 a lemon, 1 tsp dijon, small handful grated parmesan, 150ml olive oil, salt & pepper. Whizz all that up for the sauce, then the salad is just lettuce, croutons, parmesan shavings + chicken + whatever else!
4176 2018-08-22 17:29:41 Aye,also no one in the world went on about the fall in the price of oil more than Westminster/MSM how convenient also Norway and other countries kept producing as normal where is Westminster didn’t how convenient for Westminster/MSM,P S from an ex drilling Rigg worker
4177 2018-08-22 17:29:17 @Scottymechanic when I pump my brakes at a stop, I hear a loud dry thumping sound noise, what can it be? It sounds like I need to oil something. Thanks!
4178 2018-08-22 17:29:12 Your car don’t at least tell you how much oil it has? Peasantry 
4179 2018-08-22 17:29:03 Coconut oil and grass-fed butter don’t have super powers I'm afraid guys.  They are healthy, but you can stop drinking it now lol!

4181 2018-08-22 17:28:57 I had a friend with cancer (unsure which type). She took a spoonful castor oil in morning and evening (don't know for how long). She's now cancer free. She also took lemon juice with honey for energy.
4182 2018-08-22 17:28:53 Clearly there was absolutely no need for that @mikeyp121 why do u put up with shitebag keyboard gangster that must be the only one in the world who is pure perfection she must be a oil painting 
4183 2018-08-22 17:28:52 this new body wash i got smells like cinnamon and i use peppermint oil shampoo so i now i come out of the shower smelling like some fucked up seasonal starbucks drink
4184 2018-08-22 17:28:44 Wandered into Pachamama today in Marylebone and then wandered straight out due to the overwhelming smell of unpleasant oil. A lot of restaurants do not pay attention to this.

4188 2018-08-22 17:28:29 Did this opportunist charlartan make a peep when #NiaWilson a black teen was murdered by a #WhiteSupremacist ? On the same scale? What’s different here??  Murder is bad, No matter who dun it #CrisisActor #skinfolkaintkinfolk 
I hope this #MAGA snake oil pays well
4189 2018-08-22 17:28:28 Dont compare Venezuela with UK. They are in two different phases. Ven has large external debts is why its having difficulties and dependent on oil revenue. The UK does have debt but not overly exposed to foreign debt. Sterling debt can be repaid by selling more debt!
4190 2018-08-22 17:28:18 暑すぎる
4191 2018-08-22 17:28:16 She flies coach. Those planes were flying that route whether she was on the flight or not. Unlike the oil and coal execs who fly private. Do you tweet at the oil execs like this?
4192 2018-08-22 17:27:48 Damn oil! That fossil fuel will run dry at some point.  Then what!

4195 2018-08-22 17:27:33 I don’t agree with that. Practice groups are slow to change and very rarely adapt or predict changes - property/construction in 2008 and oil & gas in 2013. Both sectors shut down, took firms 2 or 3 years to dispose of non-performing equity partners & their underlings.
4196 2018-08-22 17:27:30 There’s so much oil in Texas, that we have no where to store it. WEST TEXAS (KWES) - “Pipelines today, this is kind of the big constraint for us, we have about 3 million barrels of capacity with the pipelines that exist today, so again at 3.3 million barrels of production to 3.5

4200 2018-08-22 17:27:00 The crude oil price now entering in a unpredictable horizon,as listing plan of Saudi Aramco is halted.
4201 2018-08-22 17:26:57 Cloves and clove oil will be your friends for some time. Also painkillers. Had wisdom tooth taken out last December. My whole Xmas holiday week was spent visiting dentist and eating curd.
4202 2018-08-22 17:26:48 27% of new discoveries in the world of oil are in Scottish waters according to oil and gas that’s where.
4203 2018-08-22 17:26:33 I'm actually surprised that the Saudis are so pissed off with Trudeau and his Gang that they didn't raise the price for their dirty oil which we are forced to buy because of Trudeau's stupidity! Maybe they did, I'd love to know if we've been screwed again because - we have OIL!!!
4204 2018-08-22 17:26:33 You got it. Keep up the great work.
4205 2018-08-22 17:26:26 Not to brag, 
but the mechanic at the garage says that I may have set a record for the most miles driven without an oil change.

4213 2018-08-22 17:25:47 Not really
4214 2018-08-22 17:25:42 The reason why I voted for Jill Stein in 2016 was because of the environment. Both Trump and Clinton were horrible on this issue, with Clinton supporting oil wars like Iraq and building pipelines, and Trump with his blatant support of the oil companies. #goinggreen
4215 2018-08-22 17:25:37 Dummies, screw oil, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DILITHIUM!
4216 2018-08-22 17:25:33 You forget not all Scottish generated income is classed as Scottish? Oil, Gas, whisky plus others,VAT, etc
I don’t understand why you’re sow worried about us “welfare scrounging”  Scots spending all your hard earned English money?
4217 2018-08-22 17:25:33 There are reasons y we place coconut n offer ghee in our puja to our Gods. Our ancient texts &Ayurveda hv exemplified the use of coconut, oil & ghee. Shud we research on wat is already proven to us by our wise ancestors just because the West are only studying about it now?
4218 2018-08-22 17:25:29 5 billion rand oil reserve were sold for 3 billion, when is govnenment going to take matter to court to reverse the deal?
4219 2018-08-22 17:25:27 Which only shows you still don't know anything of import. Trump is implementing sanctions on Russia, opposing Russia in Syria & Ukraine, AND pushing Germany to halt the oil pipeline that will hurt Russia. Trump is opposing Putin at every turn.

Now, Putin is trying to fight back.

WTF.
4231 2018-08-22 17:24:43 An American citizen in Colorado was charged with strangling his family and putting his dead children in oil containers this past week.

It’s irresponsible and lazy to point at the immigration status of the person charged with murdering Mollie Tibetts.
4232 2018-08-22 17:24:39 A listing requires an assets audit... Anyone that knows Aramco knows the company's estimate of its oil reserves is to be taken with a hefty pinch of salt. Wouldn't want that info going public, would you?
4233 2018-08-22 17:24:31 Worthless figures as it doesn’t include Scottish oil revenues which are rising rapidly.
4234 2018-08-22 17:24:31 what the hell this oil on my face i swear it could come in handy for cooking a whole chicken karahi

I’ve been a fan for 10+ years! One of the only lip balms/salves I can even use. However, I’m concerned about the lanolin oil in the rose salve. Are the sheep killed? The tin states ‘not tested on animals’, that doesn’t mean they weren’t killed for the product.
4251 2018-08-22 17:23:05 S&P 500 ENERGY INDEX UP ABOUT 1.3 PCT AFTER OIL PRICES TOUCH HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE AUG 8
4252 2018-08-22 17:22:56 But Crude Oil rises 3% on large US stockpile drop and Iran sanctions. May be news is not confirmed.
4253 2018-08-22 17:22:54 Lucky we know these figures are based on Scotland as part of GB. No oil money in these figures either and we are not independent so figures are well wide of the mark. But you know that anyway. GERS was designed to always show Scotland on a bad light. Weren't they? 
4254 2018-08-22 17:22:33 What about the father who killed his wife, two daughters and then threw their bodies in oil barrels. Maybe we should castrate ALL men? That's your logic. Makes no sense to me. Trump cheated

4257 2018-08-22 17:22:19 Millions of elderly Filipinos might disagree with you, but maybe because of the non Air Conditioned ultra-hot & humid climate, the daily ingestion of coconut oil is digested & sweated out by the active elderly. Unlike us Americans who don't know how to cook with fresh coco oil.

4268 2018-08-22 17:21:30 Indeed, it's snake oil, pure and simple.
4269 2018-08-22 17:21:16 Name one thing in everyone’s day-to-day life that doesn’t require oil and one way or another, renewable energy is a great concept but we’re not there yet, so how is it going to work?

4271 2018-08-22 17:20:59 Until OPEC change strategy or there is a stand off in the Middle East  and the price of oil tumbles. Ask the 000’s who lost their jobs in the North Sea over the past few years. Whisky sales are slowing ... we need a lot more income streams than these 2
4272 2018-08-22 17:20:55 Is that professor using coconut oil in the wrong place?????
4273 2018-08-22 17:20:41 This was always what I was told, avoid food with coconut oil because it’s not comprised of “good” fats. Didn’t buy the hype that it’s healthy. Glad I didn’t!
4274 2018-08-22 17:20:30 What we get nowadays is the adulterated version of the coconut oil.
4275 2018-08-22 17:20:25 In the inevitable settlement after Indyref 2, how about this.

You keep the oil, use the pound, and see the Queen every other weekend but, in exchange you also have to keep Mundell?
4276 2018-08-22 17:20:22 The EU requires debt to GDP ratio target of 3%. Scotland is running at 9%-10% - worse than Greece or any other EU country. Scotland would need oil at $90+ to get close to that.
4277 2018-08-22 17:20:18 Today, an important grade of Canadian oil (WCS), is selling for $29.50 USD less than the North American benchmark (WTI) $67.45USD

Canadian natural gas (AECO) is selling for $1.19 CAD, yet US natural gas (NYMEX) is at $2.97USD

We all lose when we sell our resources at a discount
4278 2018-08-22 17:20:17 It worked out, so I'll try:

2x tofu, 1x mushrooms, 1x onions, chiles to taste, all finely diced, sauté briefly in olive oil, add vegetable stock to cover, reduce until fully absorbed. Sauté until tofu has browned. Add 1x diced tomatoes, sauté briefly.

4280 2018-08-22 17:20:13 If Scotland is so shit why not evacuate us all over the border into England and we can all help in the great union dream.
Oil, renewable energy, tourism and whisky are far overrated and clearly generate no meaningful money in the Union?

4286 2018-08-22 17:19:53 In the book of the Revelations, in the Bible,...it mentions of a massive quake than levels Earth's major cities.  I sometimes wonder if all the oil pumped out from underground could somehow be destabilizing to some extent.  Any thoughts whether that is possible?

4331 2018-08-22 17:16:20 Everyday we have coconut oil in our food.. On the contrary we would die without it. 
4332 2018-08-22 17:16:06 haba...  That's  good fa. At least I gt Arabian frnd which makes me an Arab too 
4333 2018-08-22 17:16:05 It's her opinion. But facts from randomised trials shows coconut oil apparently does something unexpected - it increases HDL more than it increases LDL and ends up lowering cholesterol. It's almost like nutrition is complicated.

4335 2018-08-22 17:15:52 Unless they have oil then we'll bomb fuck out of them?
4336 2018-08-22 17:15:52 Nope. Bernie didn't stand a chance against Cruz and now the socialists are globalists too? Not gonna work. Basically our economic models have been off a lot longer. We used to be an oil giant which let us concede our own economic health to rebuild Europe and Asia. Almost back.
4337 2018-08-22 17:15:41 All regionally grown oil seeds are good. If our ancestors used it; so can we. Period.
4338 2018-08-22 17:15:37 @JustinTrudeau this is why we need to slow the oil production on this planet.
4339 2018-08-22 17:15:36 Hayi just stick to fish oil qha!

4348 2018-08-22 17:15:07 Governor Ajimobi was actually an MD of an oil company. This thing is not about education or age. It is about power intoxicating people.
4349 2018-08-22 17:15:04 Or might expect higher oil prices ?
4350 2018-08-22 17:14:56 UPA Freebies: Oil subsidies for example.
4351 2018-08-22 17:14:53 Perhaps the cat is already out the bag that Saudi oil is on the decline.

4355 2018-08-22 17:14:27 They want to sell more corn starch. Coconut oil has been used for centuries, and has  become very popular recently. This report is unbelievable and used to create negative noise.
4356 2018-08-22 17:14:25 I agree, but the pipeline reduces that statistic(transporting oil). I would love to see us doing our own processing in Canada as well. Thanks for chatting.
4357 2018-08-22 17:14:16 Gotta love the racist ass far right for pushing the story of an illegal immigrant murdring a college student while conveniently ignoring the white AMERICAN who brutally murdered his family and disposed of his daughters in oil to hide the evidence. This is America
4358 2018-08-22 17:14:12 I don't even look twice at anything proudly proclaiming it has coconut oil in it as viable for my skin or hair. Nope.
4359 2018-08-22 17:14:11 Bush/Cheney allowed 9/11, started fake oil wars costing 5,000+ US soldiers lives, over 1 million human casualties & $5 Trillion (so far), then brewed greatest financial crisis ever, bilked USA of $20 trillion to bail out cronies & Obama did nothing about it & Trump is evil?
4360 2018-08-22 17:14:09 Tell them to divest from big oil, and stop worsening climate change please. Why is it acceptable to receive grants from big oil, but not tobacco companies?@UniCambridge @ZeroCarbonSoc

4365 2018-08-22 17:13:17 Yes...can move there.  Quebecois come to Alberta by the thousands and get jobs in the oil industry.  They are put in camps, paid good money and most have flight privileges to fly back to Quebec.  Umm - take the money and run.  And no they don't have to pass a government exam

4368 2018-08-22 17:13:12 There ain't nothing in this world called a free lunch. With impending oil price rise perhaps Govt is wary that they may have to get into tricky contracts in return for the aid. Just a surmise. In a democracy all is fair in war and love as long as you don't goof up like Trump.

4375 2018-08-22 17:12:48 Yes I am aware. I would like you to give me an example. Do you think Vioxx was snake oil? It killed on genocidal levels. I think it eclipses snake oil
4376 2018-08-22 17:12:39 Haha! If he has trouble shoving things, a dab of, well, coconut oil might help.

4385 2018-08-22 17:12:10 Nigerian Arabs... 
4386 2018-08-22 17:11:51 @eucopresident in 2016-17 Scotland accounted for 96% of UK oil and gas liquid production, to a value of £17.5bn. CapEx+OpEx =£13.9bn. You think you can find £13bn extra from that? And those figures come from the Scottish Government.
4387 2018-08-22 17:11:50 it was a mind-blowing night in shanghai when mark, the oil rig worker, met josh, a scuba diver, for the first time. they end up becoming parents of a forty year old horse. said to be james franco's best role yet.

4393 2018-08-22 17:11:20 Why should I ever expect the US to make a move towards green renewable energy when we are still occupying a country that didn’t attack us and we just use them for their oil? Smfh 
4394 2018-08-22 17:11:19 Oh so the next agenda is to ban coconut oil in India which is used daily in cooking and for your hair down south till now Nothing has happnd now this Harvard Moron has come out with this New stupid finding My mom has been using from the age of 5 she is 72 and still uses so

4404 2018-08-22 17:10:20 If you haven't read about the whale oil industry, perhaps you should. 
Fossil fuels have till 2040 and it will be just like whale oil. Lots of uses for it, but not in demand. Replaced.
4405 2018-08-22 17:10:13 Data is the new oil...

4414 2018-08-22 17:09:45 風強いなあ
4415 2018-08-22 17:09:39 It's a new conspiracy theory, they're intentionally misunderstanding the RTS use of the jargon term 'unknown region' to pretend there's a secret hidden narnia-like region of oil and gas - whereas in fact this has no bearing on O&G revenues in GERs nor GDP in QNAS.

4419 2018-08-22 17:09:26 Same - coconut oil is for putting in your hair, not your frying pan

4422 2018-08-22 17:09:12 Snake oil? Like what? Name a snake oil please.
4423 2018-08-22 17:09:10 I think Dr's, health insurance companies, pharmaceuticals should be charged the equivalent of what they charge for a 5 minute appointment, meds or insurance.  Like milk $50,  a haircut $300, gas $30 a gallon, oil change $500. See how they like it for something they need

4427 2018-08-22 17:08:26 $CEI oil play.
4428 2018-08-22 17:08:18 Printing more money in Venezuela wont save their economy in short term. They have debts denominated in US $. Oil fell priced in $ so theyve had difficulty paying off debts. Also US is sanctioning Venezuela for political reasons.
4429 2018-08-22 17:08:18 Life is a furnace of living oil, but the opinionated cowards know nothing about it.
4430 2018-08-22 17:08:10 fundamentally the most effective way to create a strong economic foundation is through central planning. this is why japan is a leading automaker, why south korea is a tech powerhouse, and why the US is a major exporter of oil; all of these industries were centrally planned.
4431 2018-08-22 17:08:10 And if the courts or the people eventually succeed in stopping Kinder Morgan, the oil will get shipped by rail.  We'll need to stop that too.  #yyj #bcpoli
4432 2018-08-22 17:08:04 I remember my mum being horrified when my sister went through a phase of frying stuff in coconut oil! She stopped very soon after she thought she started to see a cholesterol ring around her iris 
4433 2018-08-22 17:07:58 The U.S. has enough oil to become independent of the rag head world and we should.
4434 2018-08-22 17:07:58 And I know its been said a million times but transporting oil for processing is not environmentally responsible or good business. If we want to use it we should be doing it in Canada, reducing the cost to Canadians and risks due to spills. But thats just my own opinion

4449 2018-08-22 17:05:23 There are proven studies, done in West, which says that cold pressed coconut oil is a great source of essential nutrients and has cancer fighting properties.
4450 2018-08-22 17:05:20 u should’ve brought up the white dad that killed his wife and two daughters and tried to play it off in an interview that they ran away but whole time he put their bodies in oil tanks

4453 2018-08-22 17:05:08 someone has fibbed to you. 'unknown region' is a RTS jargon term that has no effect on the O&G revenues in GERs, it's not a secret narnialike land of hidden oil.

4466 2018-08-22 17:04:22 Venezuela is one of the US’s top 5 providers of oil by import so you’re one of their customers, but “people buy food at stores” is an airtight argument for capitalism being good, sure, why not.
4467 2018-08-22 17:04:17 Linking your currency to the dollar or oil can certainly cause instability but I don't see how it can cause the value of your currency to fall by 100x or whatever.

4475 2018-08-22 17:03:34 nope, 'Unknown region' is a jargon term from RTS, it has no effect on oil & gas revenues allocated to Scotland in gers, nor gdp in qnas. 'factcheckscot' isn't a factchecking service btw, he's just a troll posing as one.
4476 2018-08-22 17:03:29 Haha yess and actually the meat during bakrid is so good that it actually cooks really well and the fat literally melts. Like you can cook it even without much oil just using the fat
4477 2018-08-22 17:03:16 I have empathy for rubes suckered by slick con men, but Trump was not that. He’s a snake-oil salesman with labels on the bottles and signs on his wagon that say “PURE SNAKE OIL.”

4499 2018-08-22 17:01:37 I think we all knew this when Goldman released their oil to $200 forecast at $70 a barrel. Inflation is dead, Oil is dead. Saudis have pulled the pin.
4500 2018-08-22 17:01:29 Oh "arab land" yeah - bye bye. Your culture is doomed not because of us but because of Xenophobia. You do nothing in thie world but sell oil and slaughter people. Such a sad end to a great race.

4514 2018-08-22 17:00:26 Dear person-doing-a-sales-call,
Small suggestion; do a little research before you call. Just a little. Like maybe find out that we're a non-profit in the oil & gas world, not an operator, before trying to sell me on oil-field equipment.
Thanks.

4520 2018-08-22 17:00:07 Urgh I dislike how the only files that are literally dripping in oil but I ain't taking no luvos
4521 2018-08-22 17:00:01 Have I missed something, I'm on twitter everyday and I have not seen any reference to anyone claiming oil is the mainstay of the economy however the Tories proved it to their own satisfaction by not doing anything constructive with it's cut of 'secret' £300,000,000,000
4522 2018-08-22 16:59:53 Colon cancer has a strong association from overused oil in take away fish and chip shops.
4523 2018-08-22 16:59:28 So when oil was well over $100 a barrel, why then were our gas prices not reflective of that?  In 2012 crude oil was $90 a barrel (US) and gas sold at an average price of $3.00 a gallon, or .75 cents a liter.  Wow, we are really getting hosed!!
4524 2018-08-22 16:59:28 I need a hot oil treatment
4525 2018-08-22 16:59:22 Who left all that oil around?  Can I sue them?
4526 2018-08-22 16:59:18 Tried cannabis-infused coconut oil as toy lube last night, and damn! Smooth and slick, doesn't dry like water lubes. A warm body stone, more pleasure, relaxed muscles...will definitely do it again.

4533 2018-08-22 16:58:54 You can read stories about how coffee enemas have cured tons of things too, even cancer, doesn't mean it works, but there is no shortage of testimonials, those are always used to sell snake oil like homeopathy.
4534 2018-08-22 16:58:53 I usually use extra-virgin olive oil for low-temperature cooking and avocado oil for high temperatures. Both have a healthy fat profile.
4535 2018-08-22 16:58:50 If we stopped importing oil from the U.S. how long do u think it would be before the US started restricting oil imports from Canada.
4536 2018-08-22 16:58:42 The IDIOT in the White House directed the EPA to roll back regulations on coal, oil drilling on protected lands, auto emissions, global warming, clean water, etc. for POLITICAL reasons to get more votes in states that will benefit. What a disgrace to the future and our children!!
4537 2018-08-22 16:58:41 Saudi Arabia has called off both the domestic and international stock listing of state oil giant Aramco and disbanded advisers, according to reports
4538 2018-08-22 16:58:11 That's not remotely true though, the use of 'unknown region'(doesn't mean what you claim either, incidentally) in RTS has absolutely no bearing on how much oil & gas revenue is allocated to Scotland in GERS nor on GDP for QNAS.
4539 2018-08-22 16:58:09 There are many reports which state that coconut oil is good for health.This Harvard professor sounds like our Ram Guha.

4572 2018-08-22 16:55:57 Her family says not to use her death as a political point. He worked for a GOP owned farm. Anything about that? How about the white American who dumped his kids in motor oil after he murdered them and his pregnant wife? Nothing to say on that?

4617 2018-08-22 16:51:22 Adam, an independent Scotland would have no deficit, the Sot Deficit is an assumption made by the UK govt. just distract Scot Deficit of an oil income of say 30 billion and you have a surplus of 17 billion.
The 30 billion is now syphoned away.

4630 2018-08-22 16:50:06 These are paid scientists, once before they have done this against coconut oil this must be on the behest of veg oil producers like palm oil. B'coz at present coconut oil is more expensive and in demand.

4632 2018-08-22 16:49:59 Sounds like he is advocating for an oil standard. Or a wood standard. Or food standard. He'll, lets just go back to barter :)
4633 2018-08-22 16:49:41 Wishing protesters would educate themselves on how oil is shipped across oceans and the environment tragedies occur in an environment impossible to clean up. One sided information is not knowing the ramifications of stopping the pipelines. It would be so terrific to not use fuel

4639 2018-08-22 16:49:05 Is it oil lobby , trying to play spoil sport
4640 2018-08-22 16:49:03 We don’t go by any of these campaigns, but by our own experience. We see Kerala uses tonnes of coconut oil in cooking, and they have wonderful health. All these studies will keep shifting stands and make us go mad.
4641 2018-08-22 16:49:01 Crude Oil will be manipulated to even higher levels now. 80$ Anyone?
4642 2018-08-22 16:48:56 We need to check who sponsors her.. Probably soy/seed industry. Our family for generations used mostly coconut oil for cooking, and everyone lived past 90.. and to call it as poison proves that it was agenda driven..
4643 2018-08-22 16:48:49 If the UK even taxed oil production as effectively as the Norwegians do it wouldn’t be quite so bad. Profits hand over fist to big companies with limited benefit to the population
4644 2018-08-22 16:48:47 Add big oil as well. Look into what happened in Oklahoma just recently. All of the energy corporations in the state gave roughly 100k each to the campaign against the medicinal bill that was overwhelmingly passed by the people here.
4645 2018-08-22 16:48:44 Hello @Abhishekkar_  sir, could you please make some videos on crude oil, looking forward to learn some strategies in crude oil from you.

4650 2018-08-22 16:48:22 sun oil is THAT bitch
4651 2018-08-22 16:48:19 How are the finances of Scotland governed by the UK related to Scotland as an independent country with full control over economics? To make that comparison implies no change but let me help. £37 billion in oil revenue, £5 billion renting faslane to the UK , tarrifs etc.
4652 2018-08-22 16:48:18 Smh lazy fucks ... those jobs don’t take long at all while the oil is draining you can change the tires out ... yeah 30 mins max lol

4655 2018-08-22 16:48:05 2014 yoons said oil is running oil and soon will be gone. After 2014 new oil fields are found. Now you the corrupt bend UK and its fucking corrupt media want to forget that. BBC not suppose to take sides so ask Mundell to expose the books instead you quote figures
4656 2018-08-22 16:48:04 won't be surprised if I find that this research was sponsored by some food oil producing MNC trying to peddle it's wares in Indian market.Moreover international mkt for coconut oil has grown manifolds, hence this scare mongering is expected.
4657 2018-08-22 16:47:59 New tires, wheel alignment, oil change, and a tune up  rip to my money
4658 2018-08-22 16:47:52 (As an aside: It does't matter anyway, because 
a.) today's oil prices AR-r-rE NOT LOV, dey are just nein longer abnormality high, and
b.) Fenezuela's voes started VAY BEFOR-r-rE ze drop in oil prices:

4661 2018-08-22 16:47:31 They are all bigots who are upset about being called bigots because everybody can see through their concerns. If you are upset about $146M, there are dozens of places where government spends or loses far more money. Oil subsidies, family trusts, tax avoidance, try those.
4662 2018-08-22 16:47:30 Witch hazel and tea tree oil are daily. I exfoliate weekly with a coconut oil/turmeric/baking soda mixture. I wash daily with a tearless baby wash. I'm drinking more water. What else can I do????
4663 2018-08-22 16:47:27 Coconut oil not the very elixir of life after all, Laura...?
4664 2018-08-22 16:47:25 Went on vacation check is short but just enough for rent, car insurance ,smog check ,oil change internet and gas hopefully that’s everything if not then I’m fucked lol
4665 2018-08-22 16:47:17 Studies have came out that it’s just as bad if not worse than lard! It can clog your arteries, etc. look up Harvard professor on coconut oil you can probably find it!
4666 2018-08-22 16:47:10 No more reason for oil to go up now
4667 2018-08-22 16:47:09 It *is* mentioned, en passant:

"It even spread back to Russia, striking the state oil company Rosneft."

There are quite a few (but very minor) technical inaccuracies, though.
4668 2018-08-22 16:47:05 Woke up to smell of fuel on top of the wildfire smoke....another oil spill on river or fire somewhere?

4670 2018-08-22 16:46:32 Also worth noting that the economy of Norway, same ody of water we’re exploring/utilising, is based entirely upon oil reserves

I know we're not getting involved because of oil which is b*******, there's no reason our government should be letting any of these activists died at the hands of these freaking brutes who want to treat women like dogs
4674 2018-08-22 16:46:08 Sort of like the original name for the Iraq invasion was "Operation Iraqi Liberation" (OIL)! 
4675 2018-08-22 16:46:06 Coconut oil thread coming soon bc there are a lot of misconceptions about it. Also confusion as to whether it should be used on the face or not.
4676 2018-08-22 16:46:02 The oil tax revenue from this is accounted for in GERS. The 37B figure was the total value non landed oil which is now allocated to Scottish GDP.
4677 2018-08-22 16:46:00 The government just wants your money. True enlightenment is learning to filter feed while huffing from your essential oil diffuser
4678 2018-08-22 16:45:45 I'm not challenging that. What I'm saying is it's very relevant what you eat. Yes, if you gobble down three Ribeyes a day, you'll pay for it in multiple ways. However, fish, and other lean meats have antioxidants as well as properties (fish oil/co-q10) that fight cell damage.
4679 2018-08-22 16:45:40 Somebody pls give him a kerala oil massage...he needs it badly...hope that can give him some peace...since his knowledge of Veda isn't helping him much
4680 2018-08-22 16:45:36 Little bit of honey with oil should do the trick
4681 2018-08-22 16:45:32 Couple of things.......
Unionist propaganda most effective tool is oil is a handicap, which this wee BBC clip manages to reinforce.
Mundel 'says' yet Sturgeon 'insists'
4682 2018-08-22 16:45:31 Without banging on about how we seem the be the only county to have oil reserves and it be a bad thing, it’s worth noting that with, and this is based upon EXISTING developments not any new discoveries, there being c30 years left in the basin, that’s a pretty good head start.
4683 2018-08-22 16:45:31 What about Monsanto's hold on govt? Or big pharma? Or big oil?
4684 2018-08-22 16:45:28 I put too much coconut oil in my hair now I look like Ginuwine in his prime
4685 2018-08-22 16:45:27 Do you have dry skin? Try to moisturize right out of the shower. Pat your skin dry allowing some moisture to remain, then apply oil or cream
4686 2018-08-22 16:45:23 Because 1st world countries want their oil for free and they are making them to pay for the oil, so 1st w countries are starving them until they kneeled like Colombia. If the blocked stops they will be fine
4687 2018-08-22 16:45:10 Try CBD oil mate. You don't get a dunt of this stuff.
4688 2018-08-22 16:45:03 Wait for the Harvard University suddenly patenting this poison as well and marketing it back to Indians. Sadly many Indians have lost their own cultural mooring that the genuine and healthy reason for using the oil from kalpavruksha is completely forgotten. It's gel time
4689 2018-08-22 16:44:53 i canNOT stans the smell of tea tree oil but it gets rid of acne so
4690 2018-08-22 16:44:46 I see where you're coming from, but we don't need divisions here, already deep, driven deeper still by a slowly decreasing minority's selfishness. 
I suppose selfishness comes natural to the "It's oor oil" brigade.

4692 2018-08-22 16:44:44 IMO another indicator that the Amlo administration still wrestling with energy reform that it is vehemently opposed to ideologically, yet remains law of the land -- and is potential source of revenue and oil production as it aims to reboot Mexican output and fund social programs.

4741 2018-08-22 16:40:07 Rubbish. How was she involved? You can't punish by association. That's like boycotting petrol stations because oil prices cause petrol increases. Or wanting statements from a bank robbers wife's company because of her husband. It's really a strange outlook on things. Anyways
4742 2018-08-22 16:40:05 Tonight’s got that feel about it where beers flat , team selection is dire , we don’t turn up & scrape a draw at best oil tanker blocks off bottom of herries road at full time i get 0 points on me super 6 & i open my skybet up to the emoji where my balance should be UTO #swfc
4743 2018-08-22 16:39:51 But you left a lot of us hanging with the famous oil leak that you knew about but never repaired under warranty. Traded off a fun car, hard to go back!
4744 2018-08-22 16:39:49 NOTHING will grow or live!!! Plants & animals will be suffocated with the oil seeping into the water & "coating" the land.
4745 2018-08-22 16:39:44 I'm sure, that Harvard professor recommends American GMO corn oil instead of Coconut oil (!)
4746 2018-08-22 16:39:43 こちらこそいつもありがとうございます…！！！！毎回本当にいい物を見せて頂いて…好きです…相変わらず手が早いですね？！それなのにこんな素敵な絵を生み出せるの凄すぎます〜

4747 2018-08-22 16:39:36 And in what year were people starving under Chavez? And if they were, why did the poorest people re-elect him in four elections? I think you are displaying your ignorance. People are starving now after 3 years of oil price collapse, ineptitude and violence under Maduro.
4748 2018-08-22 16:39:30 Fuel at National Oil. They rarely have bad fuels
4749 2018-08-22 16:39:23 How is @ICEgov gonna stop ISIS would that not me a department of homeland security job, CIA, FBI or an army job? Like the reason your army is fighting wars is to stop ISIS. Or am i wrong about that? Or is war all about oil and profits?

4751 2018-08-22 16:39:21 At least if everyone does now have to throw out their coconut oil, the fatbergs will smell a bit nicer?
4752 2018-08-22 16:39:19 You call him a corrupt hypocrite. He’s no different than charlatan preachers & snake oil salesmen. People will buy anything if the packaging is to their liking. Trump sells racism & his supporters are spending $$ they don’t have. Driven by sheer hatred.

4754 2018-08-22 16:39:07 What about modric, Kroos, oil and rakitic?
4755 2018-08-22 16:38:58 Bro I been using the beard oil. It’s just not working.
4756 2018-08-22 16:38:55 i think my sister is still using coconut oil on ther face
4757 2018-08-22 16:38:33 OK - I think the phrase "what planet do they live on" is literally applicable here. The continued intransigence of the oil industry to tackling the climate crisis is mind boggling. What IS their back-up plan?
4758 2018-08-22 16:38:26 EU is friend of Mullahs and enemy of Iranian people #iranbloodoil4eu Iran blood oil 4 EU .. shameful

4760 2018-08-22 16:38:03 I work hard to avoid anything that approaches whatsboutism. Didn't a father kill his 2 kids and stuff them in oil barrels and kill his pregnant wife? I don't see a difference between these two murders
4761 2018-08-22 16:37:59 Oil good....that's all they've got.

4765 2018-08-22 16:37:47 I cringe when people say coconut oil is amazing for your face. nah sis shit clogs your pores stop that
4766 2018-08-22 16:37:38 Maybe Harvard used that very impure coconut oil for their research.

4768 2018-08-22 16:37:28 Having worked in oil business for most my life, I’ve been in places at times where no tourist should ever go. Only time I was robbed was in CPH. They suffer from epidemics of pick pockets from South Europe.
However, the Danes and  CPH are exactly as the song says - wonderful!

4770 2018-08-22 16:37:20 No link, but just surmising about oil & coal since I'm in Wyoming at the moment & that's HEE-YUUGGE here. This state seems to hate D's, Obama & the EPA & all that they stand for.
4771 2018-08-22 16:37:14 Several products exist that *do the thing* better, but there's always someone suggesting a weird way to use coconut oil instead.
4772 2018-08-22 16:36:46 I like my slice with oregano garlic red peppers and oil. Lots of oil
4773 2018-08-22 16:36:41 On govt support programs - Alberta has historically not had strong programs to support those with disabilities. Keep in mind we were running a $5 billion deficit w/ oil at $70. Further slashing our rev. sources via tax cuts hurt our ability to provide these social supports.
4774 2018-08-22 16:36:38 I've had a cold for almost a full week, please send help. Ready to put my faith in any snake oil remedies you've got.
4775 2018-08-22 16:36:08 What about the long term health effects for the entire province. Can we sue big oil companies for the damage caused by climate change?
4776 2018-08-22 16:35:55 Right? And yet he is backed by Big Oil, Big Business, and Big Banks. It seems to me that he will only make changes that help them. The problem is that his backers have very deep pockets and powerful influence.
4777 2018-08-22 16:35:52 Coconut oil is not a hydrator  I’m tired of these brands lying to my homegirls
4778 2018-08-22 16:35:52 Please leave coconut oil to just us in the Eastern countries. We are fine with it.
4779 2018-08-22 16:35:40 I dont know...Daniel Craig coming out of the sea in trunks was TOTALLY SLB...he just needed more oil and the swimming trunks to be lower
4780 2018-08-22 16:35:26 I refer you to Stein's wishy-washynes on vaccines. On her dangerously uniformed views about GMOs and pesticides. Finally... to her transparent recount grift. 

Stein is a classic snake oil salesman.
4781 2018-08-22 16:35:23 And Coconut oil being a non-animal product has 0 cholesterol. It is a saturated fat but the idea that saturated fat is bad for you is highly debatable. It is transfat is that is poison.

4784 2018-08-22 16:34:57 My original state, WVa needs to diversify in its industries & even take advantage of its natural beauty.Our Houston Texans have been practicing there at the Greenbriar resort,lovely place. Our city diversified in early 80s from centering around oil & gas industries. Stronger now.

4802 2018-08-22 16:32:56 Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car. Point 1!
4803 2018-08-22 16:32:50 Why do we trade with this brutal country!  develop our own oil so we are totally independent & can market our oil as well.
4804 2018-08-22 16:32:30 Bunk! All those Polynesians in the South Pacific should have gone extinct long, long, ago. Make me wonder who paid for this. <Hint> the vegetable oil industry. Come on media...stop treating us like we're stupid.
4805 2018-08-22 16:32:11 The Kokaneegroper is standing up for women.  We still import oil from them and export Alberta oil because he doesn't support energy east.  So I guess he supports Saudi Arabia and not Alberta ?

4811 2018-08-22 16:31:36 The devolved nations are paying 55% of the UK deficit with only 18% of the population. England, with 82% of the population is only paying 45% of the UK deficit. Oil is not included in Scottish figures - that’s over £30bn missing. But you know about fixing figures #DarkMoney

4814 2018-08-22 16:30:54 Agreed
CBD oil rubbed on the back or areas of neuropathy works wonders 
It’s expensive, to get the most out of it, add it (all) to body lotion 
It will last about 3 months, depending upon how much you apply daily 
2xms day works for 24 hours
4815 2018-08-22 16:30:37 Consumption of coconut oil has been occurring over centuries in some countries. The real poison is the “western diet” as evidenced by increased obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer’s @Asia Pacific Coconut Conference 2018

4821 2018-08-22 16:30:16 Local organic Shishito peppers are back in stock!
Heat oil in a  cast-iron skillet medium-high heat. Cook peppers, turning occasionally, until they begin to blister on all sides. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately.
4822 2018-08-22 16:30:16 It's unbelievable that we have figured out a way to turn the sun, water and wind into renewable and endless energy, and we're still spending BILLIONS each year in coal and oil.
4823 2018-08-22 16:30:11 Our generation will all be dead before this occurs. Shameful. BLDP is a pioneer of the tech and our own nation won’t support them. Oil n Gas n Coal. All the support needed.
4824 2018-08-22 16:30:06 Slice it, bit of salt and pepper, olive oil, perhaps a touch of garlic...
4825 2018-08-22 16:29:46 Take for example the guy who killed his wife and children, and then stuffed them in oil tanks

4827 2018-08-22 16:29:35 This is what I’m dreaming of eating this evening! Although a gorgeous sea food linguine is also tempting with garlic and chilli oil
4828 2018-08-22 16:29:33 For once, I agree. The Scottish economy can’t be held ransom to the vagaries of a highly volatile commodity. Oil should be treated as a ‘nice to have’ and used for investment purposes only. An independent Scotland needs to be able to live without oil if necessary.
4829 2018-08-22 16:29:25 Using olive oil in the ears is the most bizarre feeling!

4834 2018-08-22 16:29:12 So are you saying AMCON never/ever gets back the monies they spend in buying the loans? How did Capital Oil/Ifeanyi Ubah get his company back from AMCON? Do you want to do some more research on this?
4835 2018-08-22 16:29:10 @EPAAWheeler Best way to control emissions -CLOSE DOWN EVERY COAL FIRED PLANT AND STOP MINING COAL.  STOP DRILLING FOR OIL AND STOP FRACKING!!!
4836 2018-08-22 16:29:07 Clearly they are delicate little flowers that cannot accept any well deserved critisicim, all countries should ban together and ostracise the shithole of a country that is saudia arabia by not buying their blood oil .

4842 2018-08-22 16:28:49 The drop in the prices of Venezuelan oil are attributable to numerous externalities that the government had little to do with. OPEC quotas, increases in domestic US oil production, lower oil consumption globally, and so on.
4843 2018-08-22 16:28:44 Dia ttp oily di tzone sih, aku biasa pake 3-4 jam an lah kira2 trs ku ilangin aja minyak di hidung pake oil control film, tp g parah sih menurutku wajar2 aja, malahan aku lebih banyak minyak kalau cuma pake sunscreen+bedak.[]

4848 2018-08-22 16:28:14 I support renewables but oil is needed still. 
I live within 1 km of solar panels,  a windmill,  and an oil pump.  The pumpjack is the only one constantly producing.  
Plus we use oil for so much more than just fuel.
4849 2018-08-22 16:28:07 This is a blessing for costal Indians. Recent years have seen a sharp rise in coconut oil price, and is rising. 
4850 2018-08-22 16:28:05 I wonder what hundred year old oil paint tastes like... hmm... I'm super paranoid about even passing the little line on the floor, like a death laser is connected to a motion detection laser grid on every of 1000 pieces on display like that wouldn't cost an extra billion dollars.
4851 2018-08-22 16:28:02 Maybe I understand what Visotskiy was singing about when he raged against Soviet rule?

The worst parts of that is where Poot is taking you. Good luck; I'd get out while travel isn't completely restricted yet? It's only going to get worse as oil keeps crashing.
4852 2018-08-22 16:27:58 "....And now this constitutes an unfair advantage FOR CHILE." - It does. The moment you have oil in an econony with little else, politics becomes a winner-takes-all contest about who can buy the army, seize oil-revenue, and pay off his clique. Left did in VZ; couldn't in CL.

4856 2018-08-22 16:27:25 "Now they have moved onto bashing coconut oil."
Nope. They've been doing this since the 90's. And they've failed repeatedly. But they've not stopped, and it's the funding that's doing all the talking here.
4857 2018-08-22 16:27:15 I am thinking that Oil is more apt if we want to think in these terms. Perhaps?
4858 2018-08-22 16:27:13 @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @SecretaryRoss why don’t you release the oil reserves? I’m paying $3.60 for 93 gas! Time to release the oil reserves gas is way too high
4859 2018-08-22 16:27:05 I’m sure many have heard of the health drink “Golden Milk”! Here’s my version of it.
 
12 oz. Oat Milk
1 tsp. Turmeric powder
1 Tbsp. Coconut Oil
1Tbsp RAW honey

Blend on low so as not to destroy nutrients but make sure its mixed well. Add cacao powder for a chocolate twist!
4860 2018-08-22 16:27:01 They’ll believe any old shite they’re fed if it’s in their interests. Secret oil fields, whisky export tax etc
4861 2018-08-22 16:26:44 Yet at the same time it was 3rd party validation that Oilers were strong, and only needed to plug a D spot, in that Bruins perceived Oil draft picks as much lower value than Flames.

4866 2018-08-22 16:26:08 Hi hello, Venezuelan here too.
Besides what Raven said, the Chavez government decided to rely so much on oil that they stopped exporting other materials. We used to export cacao, beans, rice, sugar, gold and other fine materials, but they decided that oil was more important
4867 2018-08-22 16:26:07 We need to look at the published data before making a decision about consuming coconut oil rather than accept a statement from someone just because this person is a professor at Harvard. Several hundred million people throughout the world consume coconut oil with no greater risk.
4868 2018-08-22 16:25:47 You do know that neither Scotland nor the UK own that oil and are only entitled to the tax revenue on it, all of which is correctly attributed to Scotland in GERS ?

4871 2018-08-22 16:25:24 I just need to know....is coconut oil good or bad? I’ve read so many articles explaining how great it is for the body and other articles arguing against the use of it, and I’m so confused now 
4872 2018-08-22 16:25:21 Exactly. We don't have too much choice on oil. Between Saudi and Iran, Iran is the lesser evil. Most jihadi terror against India is Sunni based.
4873 2018-08-22 16:25:19 Canada could stop producing oil, stop driving, even stop breathing and it will make NO measurable diff to world GHG's, NONE at all. BC's forest fires are from millions of acres of over-mature, diseased forests that nature wants to regenerate. Nature will have her way.
4874 2018-08-22 16:25:14 To deny GERS reality Elsie relies on Scotland’s historic contribution (past oil) to deny we’re subsidised now. I doubt that’ll wash

4920 2018-08-22 16:20:00 It was to increase the price of refined oil, but limiting supply. Raw oil was dirt cheap at the time, and the refineries didn’t want their profits to fall as a result. Our gas prices went up, because fuck the consumer. The market does not care about us. Sometimes, it goes badly.

4925 2018-08-22 16:19:49 Coconut oil's saturated fat content is a well-established (and one easy to establish) fact. The professor was not making a claim - just rejecting the unsubstantiated claims of health benefits of coconut oils (spreading wildly on the internet these days).

4927 2018-08-22 16:19:36 The sanctions prohibit banks from doing transactions with the Venezuelan government.  This means they can't restructure debt to free up cash.  Can't make repairs to increase oil production, The government can't borrow.  This ends up harming the economy and harming lives.

4931 2018-08-22 16:19:06 The Venezuelan economy is dominated by oil exports and the price of oil. The average inflation rate in Venezuela in the 1990s under right-wing governments was around 50%. Maduro is turning into a tyrant. But Chavez was genuinely popular. 2/2

4939 2018-08-22 16:18:14 Chavez died in 2013, oil prices collapsed in 2014 and not only is Maduro extremely unpopular and completely unable to respond effectively, but has had to rely on increasingly hostile ways to secure his power.

4943 2018-08-22 16:17:47 A large amount (more than 50%) of Venezuela's economy was reliant on high oil prices. The Chavez government thought they were going to last forever and significantly expanded spending on very popular social programs.

4998 2018-08-22 16:12:48 I think it has more to do with how you cook them.  If you don't care about added calories use lots of butter or bacon.  Otherwise use a nice olive oil and sautee them with garlic, onions, sea salt, and black pepper.  I'm a fat man, I know what tastes good.
4999 2018-08-22 16:12:22 I get them if I use coconut oil to remove mascara. Basically anything thick and oily on my eyelids and they will show up. I usually just have to wait it out 
5000 2018-08-22 16:12:22 Any oil beyond limits associated with many diseases.. the same is with alcohol... make it understand ..u may considered as slow poison.
5001 2018-08-22 16:12:18 I also still see lots of Gas fired vehicles in Canada and last time I looked we are in an oil deficit. So, where do you prefer to buy the needed oil from? The USA, Russia, Venezuala, or Alberta? I'm not trying to be confrontational, but it's simply bigger than the pipeline.

5007 2018-08-22 16:11:56 Clinically i would say to meet his masters... Until we're off oil, that's where the King of Earth lives... But that's my conspiracy theory.
5008 2018-08-22 16:11:51 Can't you people even DO research?
He ADMITTED voting Communist party of USA for f*cks sake
You've been lied to about Russia as well.
Like how Putin's ONLY export is gas and oil - we out produce the and get OPEC to lower 
The price and wallah a tactical nuke on his economy
5009 2018-08-22 16:11:50 Thats where we differ, its net more outflow than inflow. None of the big ticket items such as trade agreements, oil export to india, investment in indian infrastructure, defence or space collaborations were picked up. None of that..
5010 2018-08-22 16:11:45 Oh yahhh we still haven’t forgotten the olive oil scandal. Just putting it out there.

5035 2018-08-22 16:09:27 It’s rather silly that a women who isn’t Muslim would be imitating one, we call that pandering for for votes . Their is more at play here then just the scarf . She’s losing voters due to her screw up with the oil pipeline.

5040 2018-08-22 16:09:08 1.Avoid cutting the hair below the skin thus preventing it from growing back inwards.
2.Sanitization after a cut ,a massage of tea tree oil into the skin works wonders.
3.  A 2/3 time exfoliation dependant on sensitivity to remove dead skin.
4. moisturize with a light face cream.
5041 2018-08-22 16:09:08 I mean we already know for sure that @American_Heart is compromised by seed oil bias. It’s so sad. They support the actual product killing so many(soybean, corn oil)while blaming the original safe oil. Absolutely disgusting. Why wouldn’t BHF be the same way?
5042 2018-08-22 16:09:07 Looks like MM's are buying oil today @twomilelateral @oracle_of_oil
5043 2018-08-22 16:09:06 Already did. The operator was unable to explain why you are more expensive in my local Halfords. A 30min drive away you are cheaper. At first she said 'Halfords work like oil prices' .I had to explain to her i'm not buying oil and she had to then ask the manager for help.
5044 2018-08-22 16:09:05 We're not. And I would equally suggest to him that oil revenue fluxuation is not an argument against independence either.
5045 2018-08-22 16:09:04 3/4 of my skincare routine is dermatologist prescribed. I have bad cystic acne too and I'm on spirinotactone cause I can't take the pill anymore. But I only use bio oil for my face and aveeno calming face wash in the morning. My skin is so sensitive.
5046 2018-08-22 16:09:00 The oil change guy's name is Tanner. I find this very worrisome. Oil change guys should be named Mike or Joe.
5047 2018-08-22 16:08:56 I just throw some oil and balsamic vinegar on it and bake it for a while. Am I doing it wrong? (Note: This is very possible. I am famous for completely ignoring all cooking instructions in favor of expediency.)
5048 2018-08-22 16:08:50 I'd be surprised if it wasn't
5049 2018-08-22 16:08:43 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa. I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating doughnut instead of rubbing the oil on his head.

5053 2018-08-22 16:08:26 Coal isn’t clean! It’s unsafe for workers and our planet too. Clean energy creates jobs. Coal mongers need a new line of cash flow and you need to do your job for the American people and not for oil and coal companies.
5054 2018-08-22 16:08:20 it's just mindless bullshit. so much legal snake oil floating about with GDPR. you needed consent before, you need it now. to coin a phrase: nothing has changed.
5055 2018-08-22 16:08:14 Who advertises on Globe and Mail? Generally oil companies spend a lot on advertising on most news outlets, I doubt they are any different. 

Like most things in life: follow the money. 
5056 2018-08-22 16:08:14 More like "this guy wronged me because I rolled "low" in a social challenge, I'm going to burn his house down during this riot, I know, I'll use this rope soaked in oil that I will grappling hook onto his roof and then stand there and watch waiting with anticipation of ignition"

5066 2018-08-22 16:07:37 It's so expensive tho. I did a mud mask yesterday that has tea tree oil in it
5067 2018-08-22 16:07:28 These pussies who are against fracking are failing to understand that oil and money is more important then water!  You can get water anywhere, it falls from the damn sky!

5072 2018-08-22 16:06:56 There is NO DOMESTIC OIL so spare me the BULLSHIT all oil is global and have been linked for a hundred yrs. Meaning the market is cornered. It is why i pay 3.60 a gallon while the US exports way more than it uses. So we get enviro risk with no benefit. Liars

5076 2018-08-22 16:06:48 But no mention of the father in Fredericksburg, CO who killed his pregnant wife and 3 and 4 year old daughters and stuffed their bodies in oil cans after he strangled them?

He was a citizen. Why no mention of that murder?  No prayers for that grieving family?

5079 2018-08-22 16:06:36 You'll forgive me if I put this in with the 'coffee is bad' articles. P.s. I drink coconut oil in coffee so God help me.
5080 2018-08-22 16:06:28 This week I needed olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The local grocery store makes their own products and keeps them in barrels. They sell the containers, and I can refill for a low price. Also, they're delicious. #reducewaste #zerowaste #sustainableoptions #sustainablebusiness
5081 2018-08-22 16:06:24 which is basically canola oil.
5082 2018-08-22 16:06:23 but there are other uses for coconut oil besides just eating it...such as moisturizers, lubricants, hair products...it shouldnt be classified as poison.  and you dont use very much to cook with it anyways...

With 90+% of oil and gas in Scottish waters do you think £1.3B(GERS) is all that should be against Scotlands finances? GERS lies and fudge.

5103 2018-08-22 16:03:39 @TheBHF seems to be owned by seed oil companies. Do you disclose where your money comes from BHF?
5104 2018-08-22 16:03:35 Where's the similar outcry from these talking heads who wish to politicize and generalize a population against the white male husband and father who killed his wife and 2 daughters, and threw the little ones' bodies in an oil vat!
5105 2018-08-22 16:03:28 Scum? Unlike the quality American who strangled his pregnant wife, two kids and then buried them in an oil tank? They did cover both stories--and killers come from every background.  But a corrupt president is, not shockingly, bigger news.
5106 2018-08-22 16:03:23 Just remember  @jeremycorbyn has been an English MP for 25 years and Richard lenoard  @LabourRichard a trade unionist and MP for over 20 years They knew but kept the McCrone report on Scotland's oil wealth a secret from the Scots all that time . Men of integrity  MY ARSE

5113 2018-08-22 16:02:45 I’m sorry  the toner did that for my skin as well but stopped using it. Continued using face wash, day and night cream together with the oil. I’m the happiest this product saved me

5115 2018-08-22 16:02:36 Whoever just farted in the passage in Woolies, upstairs, the ladies section, Canal Walk, you need to see a doctor or get some castor oil.
5116 2018-08-22 16:02:29 According to @DanBoydNM and the @ABQJournal the State of #NM is looking at $1.2 billion in "new" money. The nearly 20% increase is due to oil production.  Please spend it wisely! #HighHopes

5119 2018-08-22 16:01:57 I coat the knife with cooking oil. And the palms of my gloves too. This reduces the sap's adhesion to surfaces

5121 2018-08-22 16:01:34 I guess I'm missing the part where you mention that the RSAF is inept and the reason they get virtually any weapon from the US arsenal that they want is because their oil money props up a healthy portion of the defense industry.
5122 2018-08-22 16:01:32 But that doesn’t effect revenues. That’s based on what the oil price is, not how expensive it is, or is not to extract.  That effects profits.
5123 2018-08-22 16:01:24 Err, where is England going to get the electricity, gas, oil, water, fish which flows south? Scotland will have no problem finding new markets in the EU and beyond. #DissolveTheUnion

5127 2018-08-22 16:00:58 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their Oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil or palm oil
5128 2018-08-22 16:00:51 #Oil prices rose 2 percent on Wednesday, with Brent crude futures hitting a two-week high, after data showed a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories due to strong refiner demand and as U.S. sanctions on #Iran signaled tightening supplies.

5130 2018-08-22 16:00:43 The Bishop is using Canon Law regarding a childs understanding of the difference between good and evil. What a travesty of judgement!  How can  he reconcile within himself that the predators hands are the same ones anointed with the Oil of Gladness (Chrism). He must resign

Coconut oil is about 2/3 medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), also called  medium-chain triglycerides or MCTs. These types of fatty acids produce a  whole host of health benefits. Coconut oil is nature's richest source  of these healthy MCFAs......

5147 2018-08-22 15:58:58 Petro is just a 'fancy' name to the oil's price... The problem is that many Maduro's supporters do believe in it and are very happy with the anchoring of our 'new' currency with that. 

Is like a lofi cypherpunk nightmare down here...

5151 2018-08-22 15:58:23 Poor thing. French fries tasted much better back then. Animal fats fry differently than veg oils & foods absorb much less oil. No data on this, but there may have been a significant increase in calories in fried foods in general because of switch in fats.
5152 2018-08-22 15:58:19 Errrg 45mins?? Am I drilling oil? 
5153 2018-08-22 15:58:11 Your idea of a Russian asset is a little messed up,  do you really think that helping our coal and oil industries are helping Russia?
Exactly the opposite is true,  we can sell more oil and coal to Europe and that severely damages the Russian economy.

5166 2018-08-22 15:55:56 My pawpaw has went and got my oil changed and washed my car for me 
5167 2018-08-22 15:55:53 CONSUMERS are not subject to EXCISE TAX. It has nothing to do with you running a gas station. The reality here is; the OIL COMPANY is liable for EXCISE TAX, for importing the GASOLINE from ALGERIA or SAUDI ARABIA, to RESELL IT.
5168 2018-08-22 15:55:38 Said it will be a hour and a half for an oil change smh. Man if this wast free I would have went to express oil change down the street. In and out in 5 mins

5174 2018-08-22 15:55:09 Thank you, sir. Civilian casualties are inevitable in war, but when they are targeted in conflicts like this, and with our de facto assistance, the US needs to stand up and take the high ground. Some things matter more than oil.
5175 2018-08-22 15:55:03 I'm laughing not crying. Saudis should be very grateful to the West for inventing uses for oil. Otherwise you'd be eating sand. Instead you can now buy foreign children to race camels for your entertainment. And enslave the filipinos and bangladeshis who do all your work for you.

Please explain to me how this asshat isn’t a racist.

5194 2018-08-22 15:53:03 To be fair though. Our club has to balance the books the best way they can. Sponsors being a massive part. We can't all dig up an airline company or a couple of oil barons to help us along.

5197 2018-08-22 15:52:36 My mom isn’t talking to me because I parked in the drive way and my car leaked oil on the driveway.

5199 2018-08-22 15:52:30 While Canada buys Saudi oil? What a joke. They sure attend with you guys, oh except financially. 

And I'm not paid by anyone. Canada has a right to self governance, so does Saudi. Tweeting out a support statement is not the same as meaningfully negotiating. Canada acted stupidly
5200 2018-08-22 15:52:29 I hear about investment leaving in the oil and gas industry all the time by people that work in the industry. 
Are you going to make fun of me as well ? 
I also hear about and see the when 35 billion in one project alone, walks away.
5201 2018-08-22 15:52:24 No wonder all pretas are white, after drinking/eating coconut oil 
5202 2018-08-22 15:52:22 Just so you know they've been using coconut oil for cooking in India and the Philippines for a long while. Not just wypipo

5205 2018-08-22 15:52:12 I’d go in with her bc I’m getting a du-rag, but I suddenly needed 4 bottles of hair dye that’s 2 different colors, a mixing bowl, gloves, my hair naturally black, so bleach, the brush, tea tree oil, hair milk. Is that my friend from high school? We have to cackle, then I leave.
5206 2018-08-22 15:52:02 I didn’t think you were old enough to know about patchouli oil.
5207 2018-08-22 15:51:55 It’s funny, I have always envied people in the oil fields. To think tomorrow U get to see what it’s all about. Ready to get this money... and my company truck/ gift card 
5208 2018-08-22 15:51:48 Where's  your outrage over the father/husband (American Citizen) who murdered his pregnant wife and two little girls and stuffed them in oil tanks. Murder is murder no matter the nationality and they all deserve our wrath. 
#MurderIsNotPolitics
5209 2018-08-22 15:51:46 I wonder what the price differential is between the price of oil we’re importing from the US in the East to the price of oil we’re getting, with exporting to US refineries from the Trans Mountain Sumas line?
5210 2018-08-22 15:51:46 I accuse Colonel Olive oil of committing the crime in the in the desert with the candlestick!
5211 2018-08-22 15:51:45 They are jealous that india is so rich in this matter and ours country remain under snow fir most of the year,nothing grows.they want to export palm oil,refined oil vwhich is pure poison
5212 2018-08-22 15:51:45 cause I notice the storyline is now getting to the core and the ancestors feel betrayed by the old man( isithunywa) and as you (character) one of the sharp brains of Maluju oil Empire, you could be the victim of the ancestors' wrath
5213 2018-08-22 15:51:41 It’s almost impossible now to construct an environmentally sound, regulator-approved oil pipeline in Canada. If passed, Bill C-69 will make such a thing *absolutely* impossible. Meanwhile ON and QC will continue to import Saudi etc. oil. Stupid, stupid, stupid. @JustinTrudeau
5214 2018-08-22 15:51:35 Within the period Nigerians lost jobs, the second largest producer of oil in Africa after Nigeria, Angola lost jobs too, likewise every oil producing economy world over, it takes insanity to place global oil shock phenomenon on Buhari.
5215 2018-08-22 15:51:34 In 1998 a Columbus native Stanley Meyer was poisoned at the Cracker Barrell in Grove City because he created an engine that ran on water and the U.S knew that would interfere with the billion dollar oil industry. #StaywokeColumbus

5218 2018-08-22 15:51:09 Let’s talk about the white man in Colorado that murdered his pregnant wife and children and left them in an oil grave. Or... all the other WHITE men that commit mass murders throughout our nation....

5222 2018-08-22 15:50:51 Disgrace . Sanctions should be applied by all countries . Oh wait they have Oil. Ok they fine keep killing young woman.
5223 2018-08-22 15:50:45 Waiting for an oil change at the dealership and wondering why anyone old enough to drive a car is still wearing Axe. Someone needs to ditch that middle school mindset.
5224 2018-08-22 15:50:41 It was about oil...right?
5225 2018-08-22 15:50:39 I don't know about the "young and hip" part but I like going to Lee Valley.  They have lots of neat stuff.  And yes, rags soiled with gas or oil can start their own fire.   Hay too (just in case you're planning to stockpile some).
5226 2018-08-22 15:50:39 Puke. I'm waiting to get my oil changed and this lady is crying because she is being touched by "Jesus". Cocaine is a gel of a drug.

5230 2018-08-22 15:50:02 I’ll try it. I kind of hate the sensation of oil around my eyes but I guess it’s either that or raccoon eyes at the end of a muggy day.
5231 2018-08-22 15:49:52 think latterly for a second, regarding the oil producers and the likes of seas, then they kinda have some experience where tidal investment would supply that h2 - offshore?

It pays for them to be throwing money at converting sea water to h2 with rigs even today as test models
5232 2018-08-22 15:49:46 It is still higher in saturated fat compared to alternatives. The oil should definitely be used sparingly.

5244 2018-08-22 15:48:46 cannabidiol is in THC but it isn’t psychoactive. It can’t get you high at all. It’s completely legal. It can be used for pain, anxiety, depression, acne, etc. I have been using the gummies but just got the oil yesterday. I get it at the vape shop!
5245 2018-08-22 15:48:45 but it's very exciting tech and assuming the advertising isn't just snake oil (I don't think it is tbh), looks to be the big thing that drives generational fidelity that people have been looking for given the dif between ps3 and ps4 was way more minor than any other gen change
5246 2018-08-22 15:48:44 DGAZ trailing stop, exit 20.96 -2.
I've also been in and out of UWT as OIL chops higher, scalps like this not worth it. Made daily goal though. 
This tour of duty over for today, till tomorrow. Morning Briefing begins 6am ET each day.
5247 2018-08-22 15:48:42 A business opportunity to be sure, but also one of the most important environmental risks related to oil & gas development. More pipes and fewer trucks have the potential to be better for the environment and local communities if pipeline spills are minimized.

5249 2018-08-22 15:48:26 Mincha brought as hatat must be more expensive than usual one, hence requirement for oil and Levonah.

5252 2018-08-22 15:48:19 Bath them in warm water before bed and give them gentle massage with non allergic soothing oil, allover their body. They cry because they are uncomfortable. Soothing gentle massages would help.
5253 2018-08-22 15:48:19 Definitely not true. It’s an oil refinery, not a nuke 
5254 2018-08-22 15:48:15 Their fries is eto be good back when they actually had the machine over the fryer with the mashed potatoes dropping into the oil.

5256 2018-08-22 15:48:14 Bless their little Remain cotton socks, all for the good of le Grand Project. I do hope someone tells the little poppets that veg oil is not a very good substitute for insulin though, & that stockpiling on a public street is probably not  a good idea. Brexit zombies and all that!
5257 2018-08-22 15:48:12 Congratulations, I sincerely wish you many more happy years to come but hope you remember that you serve the state and it’s people, not Big Oil, not Big Donor’s, not the GOP and not Trump. Please do the right thing for the country and vote against Kavenaugh

5259 2018-08-22 15:48:06 I get so annoyed when I come for an oil change and these men assume I don’t know anything about cars. Aw naw baby, you tried it though.
5260 2018-08-22 15:48:02 Shop was left looking like a disaster.

5280 2018-08-22 15:45:53 @IRSTaxFraud @ChuckGrassley The IRS seized a tax frauds land in Texas, which included functioning oil Wells. They auctioned off the land, but kept the mineral rights. Sounds like the IRS likes the oil revenue a little too much. Why didn't they share this with the Whistleblower?

5298 2018-08-22 15:44:12 Not true but is it. £38billion in oil revenue is not attributed to the Scottish figures because it goes straight onto the tankers in the N sea. So actually when you figure that in we seem to have a massive surplus. How does that suit you?

5341 2018-08-22 15:39:56 Production has been declining recently and they want the IMF seal of approval so they can borrow dollar bonds more cheaply. (But higher oil prices do help.)
5342 2018-08-22 15:39:54 The recession of 1973-1975 in the U.S. came about because of rocketing gas prices caused by OPEC's raising oil prices as well as embargoing oil exports to the U.S. Other major factors included heavy government spending on the Vietnam War, and a Wall Street stock crash in 1973-74.

5353 2018-08-22 15:38:59 ...I know that's what I am saying.

The oil price drops, companies seek to mitigate a loss of profit by reducing a myriad of factors which contribute to their production costs.
5354 2018-08-22 15:38:57 Ahhh Trump, you lost a supporter. But now at least we know what's required to rid America of your Nazi clan.  We're going to need a couple of thousand empty oil tankers. Pretend again to be ok with it and see what you can do.

5360 2018-08-22 15:38:08 Coconut oil is a product created to ease oversupply of a relatively unwanted product. It's really that simple. Turn it into a health trend and bam, problem solved.

5366 2018-08-22 15:37:32 your petrol companies are working on turning oil to h2 for that very reason.

The other option is Nuclear to fill those batteries , taking a very long time to do so , or battery to battery from eco , meaning mining REM and increasing the wastage of them as they die.

5370 2018-08-22 15:37:08 Oil companies don’t get the ‘oil for free’ - they invest in wells to extract it under licence/lease from Govt., and therefore (naturally) expect a ROI. All the government gets is the leasing costs/taxes (which were reduced at request of SNP), and that does not come to £37bn ! 
5371 2018-08-22 15:37:00 No. Gulf Coast. Our was like that when the local oil was booming but between oil prices and a hurricane it’s been stable but reasonable.

5380 2018-08-22 15:35:56 My personal favorite is just lemon juice and olive oil. Or any citrus, really. Very rarely need to dress it up with bells or whistles.
5381 2018-08-22 15:35:48 yes, it is very strange 
once a personal trainer at my gym told me i should put coconut oil in my coffee. i did'nt take his advice  
5382 2018-08-22 15:35:46 SAME. I have this essential oil blend that’s like an icy hot patch. I’m trying that when I get home cause I’M DYING.

5384 2018-08-22 15:35:39 Thank God for coconut oil
5385 2018-08-22 15:35:38 Exactly. People too quick to forget exactly what little Bush did. The lying and the Americans who died and were maimed in that war for oil.
5386 2018-08-22 15:35:33 What's the seasoning you use? I bake fish in Banana leaf and marinate it in Mustard oil, Mustard and Rai seeds (ground), red chili and salt. It turns out very well.

5395 2018-08-22 15:34:52 Not referring to oil contract. Think CIPS. The Chinese ruling class uses capitalism on the micro level to enhance productivity but direct the macro via long term command and control. They understand capitalism and its weaknesses

5400 2018-08-22 15:34:05 My opinion reflects the current state of the technology and the policy. It's realistic. That said, electricity can displace oil much faster if we choose to accept the higher costs and greater risks. Thus far, Canadians are not on board with that (cf. Abacus Data surveys).
5401 2018-08-22 15:33:57 Coconut oil worse for you than ya granny’s Crisco? Bet .
5402 2018-08-22 15:33:57 Hair oil will fry it better
5403 2018-08-22 15:33:45 And it’s not production costs that effect oil prices, it’s oil prices that effect production costs.
5404 2018-08-22 15:33:41 Happy hump day y’all! Monday we replaced Jamey’s radiator fan and oil, today we take on the brakes! Getting everything road trip ready...
5405 2018-08-22 15:33:35 If you think boobs are the softest thing on the planet, try touching a 1 Liter refined oil packet for a change.

5406 2018-08-22 15:33:32 Bruh it has never taken this long for my oil change and stuff like come on I'm about to fall asleep.
5407 2018-08-22 15:33:30 And that oil from the train that killed so many was from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota..So if you want more spills, more disasters by all means stop the pipelines even though they are a safer method of delivering oil.
5408 2018-08-22 15:33:29 Women get a car and don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant... No Nothing! They just wake up and drive that muthaphucka! 
5409 2018-08-22 15:33:23 I used to agree w/ that. Fundamentally I don't think the Chinese ruling class knows what the point of capitalism is. Just like Japan or S. Korea. They are linear keynesians. The Yuan oil contract is a Russian idea.
5410 2018-08-22 15:33:18 No, I'm not surprised that using bulbine herb and oregano oil did not treat your dog's diarrhea. Would have been rad if you, like, did not wait a week to bring him to the vet
5411 2018-08-22 15:33:17 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
5412 2018-08-22 15:33:06 Don't forget Duckie to add the oil into the fire 
5413 2018-08-22 15:32:56 hardest pill i had to swallow was

5416 2018-08-22 15:32:43 While you continue to undermine the #EPA and line your (and the #Republicans) pockets with coal and big oil donors $$$$$.  May future generations of little #Trumpzis suffer the effects of #ClimateChange. #ClimateChaos #CorruptGovernment
5417 2018-08-22 15:32:39 Am I to now assume that you have run a fuel station?
One does not need to run a gas station to comprehend TAXES and PROFITS. EXCISE TAX is levied, only by CANADA CUSTOMS. Its a COMMERCIAL TAX. Its what the OIL COMPANY must pay for their imports. Not the CONSUMER; they pay HST.
5418 2018-08-22 15:32:37 But Canada still lined up to buy our oil from these clowns.
5419 2018-08-22 15:32:35 I need a extra gooey cheese pizza topped with pepperoni, fresh garlic, onions, peppers, bacon, black olives and drizzled with hot and spicy honey oil. I need it now.
5420 2018-08-22 15:32:34 Harvard do not know. In fact, water is More Poisoning than coconut oil. Please don't drink water. Instead, drink Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola etc.  Believe me.

essential oil diffusing
relaxing music
yoga asana and yoga pranayama 
ingesting liquid valerian root 
Maybe a facial steam
And an eye mask.
5423 2018-08-22 15:32:22 they should make juul pods with thc oil in em 
5424 2018-08-22 15:32:17 Mightn't there be more survival value in "blaming" Big Oil -- for fanning the flames by blocking solutions and expanding fossil fuel infrastructure -- and making them stop?
5425 2018-08-22 15:32:08 Peak oil demand is driven by fuel efficiency standards and electrification. Absent much tougher standards, a battery step change breakthrough, or other draconian policies (e.g. banning sale of ICE vehicles), ain't gonna happen. My adoption estimates are more pessimistic than IEA.
5426 2018-08-22 15:32:07 We have Kroger brand olive oil mayo in the fridge. I don't think I can bring myself to have strong feelings on this one. It's not like it's BBQ styles or something pivotal.
5427 2018-08-22 15:32:04 False; we’re at war for Oil rights. If you want to save energy go solar power like #europe #china
5428 2018-08-22 15:31:54 มีvivid oil ไหมคะ

5435 2018-08-22 15:31:16 The problem with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela is they built their entire economies around one resource, oil.

That is why they have both been struggling since 2015.

5438 2018-08-22 15:31:06 Is it a cleaver trick to promote olive oil?
5439 2018-08-22 15:31:03 They're snake oil salesmen
5440 2018-08-22 15:30:56 Snorton, Biffo and Shagger. Snorton gets bullied a bit by the others for being a nerd but in the scene after the credits we learn that he got lucky on the futures markets and then married someone from an Oil of Ulay ad.

5448 2018-08-22 15:30:06 You appear to have deleted the tweet so I can't see what you actually said. Now you're attributing the drastic decline in world oil prices to Harper. You hold him in high, high esteem.
Now oil has recovered but dollar is about the same. What gives with Jr. Trudeau

5453 2018-08-22 15:28:45 A conglomeration from recipes on the internet. 
Melted a couple of tbsps honey with 1 tbsp local cold-pressed rapeseed oil (buttery loveliness). Added some vanilla essence. Then stirred that into some oats, cashews, flaked almonds, seeds that I found at the back of the cupboard.
5454 2018-08-22 15:28:45 I see you konservatives are manufacturing outrage and are giddy that her alleged killer is an undocumented immigrant. Yet, in the past week a US citizen murdered his entire family, stashed the children's bodies in oil barrels, another US citizen killed his family by plane crash.
5455 2018-08-22 15:28:38 I had no idea you can make oil from babies

you come up with the best DIY stuff.

5459 2018-08-22 15:28:07 In the current political moment, it's hard to imagine. But that doesn't mean it's impossible. Your fatalistic "Electricity won't displace oil for decades," in my opinion, limits our understanding of what is possible. That's all.
5460 2018-08-22 15:28:02 Oily ka lang walang oil

5462 2018-08-22 15:27:59 Can't believe David Mundell is lecturing us on management of oil revenue when he and his party have been mismanaging it for decades, treating it as a windfall to splurge rather than building up the economy. Any reason we don't have a Sovereign Wealth Fund?
5463 2018-08-22 15:27:53 Oil and gas companies wouldn’t let that fly. There’d be a law in no time
5464 2018-08-22 15:27:50 I would love to see this guys stock portfolio?  Did you short coconut oil stock?  Maybe you are heavy in olive oil stock. In a week you will be forgotten.

5475 2018-08-22 15:26:52 Why do you and other "progressives" always point to countries like Canada, Norway and the UK as points of success for healthcare? Are you aware of the difference in population? Are you aware that Norway's system is mostly support by crude oil? Ask #veterans how their care is.
5476 2018-08-22 15:26:51 Remember, IEA scenarios are not forecasts. But:
-in the IEA's New Policies Scenario, you're right
-in the Sustainable Development Scenario or Faster Transition Scenario, while not fleshed out by basically anyone, oil would peak very soon, like in a year or two

5486 2018-08-22 15:25:57 We should move towards renewable energy and making current energy sources more efficient so the price of oil drops more, which will hurt the Saudis.

People say Russia is the big bad wolf, but Saudi Arabia spends more on their military than Russia does.

5493 2018-08-22 15:25:15 Looks like they are readying for a launch of some oil (which is real poison) from Some foreign country hence defaming all native Indian products

5500 2018-08-22 15:24:39 HOW CHAVEZ DESTROYED VENEZUELA. 
Chávez nationalized Venezuela’s vast and lucrative oil fields – extended his expropriation plans to sectors including aluminium, cement, gold, iron, steel, farming, transportation, electricity, food production, banking, paper and the media
5501 2018-08-22 15:24:38 Oil wealth is a phrase that actually has meaning. Technocracy has nothing to do with it. You are now using pedantry to again make the wrong point. Don’t do the right’s work for them. Social welfare is possible without oil wealth. I am still right.

5503 2018-08-22 15:24:20 @CatherineBizTV Natural gas prices reflect 3 primary factors:  the supply-demand balance; that natural gas is a by-product of oil; and the marginal cost of production.  Given how "young" shale resources are, sustaining prices above $US 3.50 is unlikely over the next decade or 2

5507 2018-08-22 15:24:09 According to GERs Scotland's economy is £160bn. Scotland's 2.5 million employed do same jobs for same companies as Ireland's 2 million employed. Ireland’s economy is £225bn. In a country with oil like Norway, GDP is £280bn. 

#GERS shows us the cost of the Union & its no cheap.
5508 2018-08-22 15:24:06 Exactly. Trump seizes on these terrible killings with NO regard for the victim, just how to maximize for his sick message. This last week "white" man killed his wife & two beautiful little daughters (found submerged in oil) but have you heard a word about that tragedy?
5509 2018-08-22 15:24:02 The "we need panels not pipelines" tag line makes no sense. Very little oil is used to produce electricity.
In any case, a better tag line would be "we need panels to displace some natural gas use." However, the gas will still produce most of the electricity on an annual basis.
5510 2018-08-22 15:23:56 If only that were the plan Peter!

The reality though is that @JustinTrudeau , @jimcarr_wpg and @Bill_Morneau have all said the Western #TMX is about exporting to Asia and making up this $15B they think we’re missing out on by only selling oil to the USA.

5523 2018-08-22 15:22:38 Desde lo tecnico coincido con lo que decis, el shale oil y shale gas es una fuente infinita de riqueza que muchos países no aprovechan. Lo que no comparto es cuando se dice: si sale esto nos salvamos... porque la historia muestra que no es así y suele ser al revés.

5525 2018-08-22 15:22:33 You could've come out with some figures of your own, today.  Like how rich Scotland could be without having to send down all our taxes to WM, without having to pay the BBC licence fee, and actually getting proper revenues from our oil. Why toe the GERS line instead?
5526 2018-08-22 15:22:28 It's possible. All the factors are present, continued bad leadership, another extended oil price downturn and it's on like Donkey Kong.

5531 2018-08-22 15:22:13 The MENA region silently laughs as a major oil producer continues to buy their oil. I can hear the table talk. Send more money of support to their political parties. We sure do love them!!!

5533 2018-08-22 15:22:13 If the professor would just point to specific research about coconut oil, I'd pay more attention. But we know so very little about what is healthy or bad because empirical studies are extremely difficult.

5538 2018-08-22 15:21:34 Before anyone points out that oil prices are low and so is the resulting tax-take, look at Norway who have still been receiving substantial revenue when UK isn’t. Not scared-of or in-cahoots-with big business over there
5539 2018-08-22 15:21:33 Is far more worrying that a “mature” person like yourself doesn’t care your Government are corrupt. It’s no oil painting here, but at least we don’t have a man child racist sexist pig who doesn’t understand anything about Politics.

5544 2018-08-22 15:21:13 I never said that the US does not buy oil from Venezuela.  The problem is that Venezuela has no access to the banking system from the revenues generated.  Yes, it is legal to sell food and medicine but it is nearly impossible to buy it because purchases are through banks.
5545 2018-08-22 15:21:00 @realDonaldTrump DO US farmers really benefit? EXACTLY what are the total benefits of E-15 when you count from plowing/seeding to final transport to oil refineries?  How much water is needed to end up with a gallon of E-15? Does @MonsantoCo sell all the seed?
5546 2018-08-22 15:20:58 Why should I be careful? There is no scenario, not even the most agressive, from any credible agency or consultancy that forecasts electricity displacing oil before 2050. Peak oil demand forecasts are for mid-2030s to mid-2040s, never mind end of oil. So...decades.
5547 2018-08-22 15:20:40 No your argument is we need more oil pipelines.
That is not mine???
5548 2018-08-22 15:20:38 You’d rather shift those emissions to Saudi Arabia and buy there oil when they murder women gays and anyone that has a different opinion. Good plan.
5549 2018-08-22 15:20:38 US is the biggest customer, problem isn't oil price it's that production has fallen by 50% and they're using oil to pay back loans to China etc.

5553 2018-08-22 15:20:30 Your headline is misleading. Please correct. More saturated fat is not poison. If anything sugar does more damage than coconut oil. Are than any other peer reviews to support her hypothesis.

Why don’t you focus on mental health when an American citizen kills his family and throws his children in an oil drum?  You can’t just choose one because it caters to your base. Not just immigrants kill.
5582 2018-08-22 15:17:22 What does the rest of the UK have that Scotland doesn't? More oil and gas? More fish? More forestry? More whisky, more gin? More water? More electricity? More renewables? More computer technology. We do have less Tories, less class division and less control. We need independence.

5615 2018-08-22 15:14:50 In all honesty, I think because President Carter made such a big deal about it. Between out of control inflation, oil embargoes, and global chaos, people were understandably skeptical of ANY more changes. 

That said, this ship sailed. Metric acceptance is long overdue.

5649 2018-08-22 15:10:54 Oil is just a bonus according to eckonomics. That bonus just lifted Scottish tax revenue to £306 less per person for last year than the UK average.

5651 2018-08-22 15:10:24 It depends on the survey and also we have a lot of third worlders here. Socialist Scandinavia doesn’t have much population or ethnic diversity. They also aren’t really socialist and rely on oil to fund their programs and face future deficits and substandard offerings.

5663 2018-08-22 15:09:32 Nearly half of the oil imported to eastern Canada comes from the U.S.
5664 2018-08-22 15:09:29 I hate having to pay for anything extra other than an oil change on my car 
5665 2018-08-22 15:09:25 Dab a bit of diluted clove oil on the tooth! Numbs the pain!
5666 2018-08-22 15:09:18 Selling snake oil.
5667 2018-08-22 15:09:06 The solicitor here should be David Stumbo. This is the one to contact. If we all squeak enough on this, we will get some oil.
5668 2018-08-22 15:09:00 Time to dress like I know a lot about cars so the guy who changes my oil doesn’t try to persuade me to buy a flux capacitor.
5669 2018-08-22 15:08:53 S'funny. I always thought Americans approved of competition. Unfortunately this only seems true if they make the rules. Woe betide you if you wish to differ, especially if your country has oil.
5670 2018-08-22 15:08:43 Coconut oil, drink water and mind my business.

5672 2018-08-22 15:08:35 Agree! JimBoman how are you doing? My phone isn’t working so my social media presence has cut down a bit 
5673 2018-08-22 15:08:31 I know right, how can lard be healthier than coconut oil?

5675 2018-08-22 15:08:25 Patients with heart complications should avoid olive oil & substitute with what ?
5676 2018-08-22 15:08:22 Adulting is driving an hour commute to work, being on time, rocking out to @Beyoncé only to find your @VW #tiguan is advising you your engine has no oil pressure & to turn off engine immediately. 
5677 2018-08-22 15:08:22 Close: I think they’re just putting them on the griddle with some oil. It would be better if they were green tomatoes, but this is already a massive substitution (these were my hash browns and pancakes) so I’m going to take what I can get! :)

5680 2018-08-22 15:08:12 When I heard he was undocumented, I knew they'd focus on that to make all immigrants look bad. Never mind the US citizen husband/father who brutally murdered his pregnant wife and two little girls - and dumped their little bodies in an oil tank. But let's talk about immigrants.
5681 2018-08-22 15:08:11 How come Norway can oversee a 17billion 2017 offshore take and in the same year the UK's take is a 1/40th of that and actually pays the oil companies.  Some £80million to Shell alone.  Its basically the same oil fields!
5682 2018-08-22 15:08:10 Any idea what the crude oil vs. condensate (specifically the NLGs) breakdown is?

5687 2018-08-22 15:07:27 I completely agree! My dad swore by it. In fact he recommended it to a friend’s son who had an accident scar on his face. He said apply coconut oil every day. The scar smoothened out. Wasn’t prominent anymore
5688 2018-08-22 15:07:17 ano daw english ng taong grasa, tas sagot nya edi baby oil HAHAHAHAHAHA bwisiiiiit HAHAHAHAHAHA
5689 2018-08-22 15:07:16 Exactly. Also if oil is heated to beyond a certain temperature it becomes dangerous. In raw extra virgin form, it’s good for you. Of course everything in moderation is the key to life
5690 2018-08-22 15:07:12 You have 30 yr olds with PHD’s. Living in basements.  Working for cash, waiting tables, pushing illegals to paint , mow and clean. We need a Military Draft!  No engineers.  GC’s look what “O” did to NASA, oil, used cars,free phones.  Really?
5691 2018-08-22 15:07:02 All the softies .. Mandle wearing beer drinking cucks! Time to toughen up the fan base we need to sign coal miners oil drillers forklift drivers etc etc .. an cut all the jakes from State Farm

5693 2018-08-22 15:07:00 @realDonaldTrump The EIA is posting false numbers about oil supplies...This is robbery off every American...the tax cuts did not help since Big oil is robbing every  American.   [[[ HELP !!! ]]]
5694 2018-08-22 15:06:56 @StephMillerShow jane fonda was right when she said trump didn't happen overnight,the dems drifted towards business,so what explains pres obama not endorsing @Ocasio2018,because he is a corp.dem,just like he picked perez for chairman that wants big oil back in the dem crasp
5695 2018-08-22 15:06:53 np PL plz take your time ..no rush.. seeing lot of buying in OIL names now SLB, COP (refiner), UCO coming nw .. I think as u called may be 74 contract highs soon in coming month
5696 2018-08-22 15:06:51 So apparently if you dont know how to “change oil” in a car youre not considered a “man” at least on twitter... but the majority of yall still live with ya moms so what kind of men are you really? “Men” move out ma nigga 
5697 2018-08-22 15:06:47 I remember a guy on the floor espousing a study on how dangerous flax seed oil was....recall the coffee studies years ago....it's bad...no, it's ok, no, bad...now, it has benefits.

5699 2018-08-22 15:06:33 InfoChip's tags are chemically etched & designed to withstand harsh conditions found in mines, on #oil rigs, & other #industrial areas.
5700 2018-08-22 15:06:33 You're welcome. If you get pure oil, be careful using it, it's pretty strong and can irritate skin and eyes. 
5701 2018-08-22 15:06:30 Yep, oil finds that are difficult and expensive to extract. You do know that the only income from oil that counts is the tax take? And that is at rock bottom because of comoanies’s expenses and low taxation (at Swinney’s behest).
5702 2018-08-22 15:06:22 Please don't forget us in Africa and the Caribbean that enjoy Thy coconut oil for centuries. Attempts to colonize our foods and cooking techniques only to rebrand it in the west as "natural".
5703 2018-08-22 15:06:16 About 10mpg oil that is.
5704 2018-08-22 15:06:09 Junior, yes, that was terrible.  How do you feel about the White guy who murdered his pregnant wife and kids, and dumped in oil field?   Are you as outraged?  The undocumented’s employer a BIG GO BTW, , such hyprocrisy, no?
5705 2018-08-22 15:06:08 Oz energy trends: overall energy use fell (marginally) from 2016 to 2017. Oil use was up, as was gas, coal was down, hydro was down (significantly: less rain I guess), other renewables were up.
5706 2018-08-22 15:06:04 Ignoring your ramblings about her record, you think her policy stated clearly online about not being for the new oil pipelines and being for clean energy is worse or just as bad as Trump saying he will be for oil pipelines and deregulating coal?

5708 2018-08-22 15:05:57 I smite the people by the anointing oil.
5709 2018-08-22 15:05:50 I’m so happy to hear you’re doing really well!   Yes, I feel the same way about Rx meds. They may relieve one problem, then create other issues. Sometimes all we want is relief and end up having to take them. But I’m so grateful for the results I’m seeing with the oil.
5710 2018-08-22 15:05:49 I like Hemp Oil, especially Canadian
5711 2018-08-22 15:05:47 กรมทรัพยากรที่ดินอะไรพวกนี้ก็น่าสนใจ แต่ต้องตามข่าวพวกข้าราชการอ่ะ ที่เขาสอบบรรจุกัน

5714 2018-08-22 15:05:27 We were oil wealthy but it was squandered by Thatcher on her epic class crusade that saw industries closed down to break unions, whilst offering tax cuts to the rich. Many areas were put into ‘managed decline’ like Liverpool. Other Nordic countries are successful without oil
5715 2018-08-22 15:05:19 もう12時ってうっそだろ
5716 2018-08-22 15:05:14 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
5717 2018-08-22 15:05:03 This dude paid for my oil yesterday n now he think I owe him da time of day to show me what real love is
5718 2018-08-22 15:04:55 Just like Obama was trying to close all refineries so we can send our oil overseas to have it refined and sent back to United States with the intention of us paying the same as they do in Europe over $5 a gallon
5719 2018-08-22 15:04:52 Absolutely loved the book! I recommend it to everyone who starts telling me sh*t like eggs are bad for heart health or where I'm gonna get calcium if I stop drinking milk... :) Or gives me that stupid article about coconut oil "poison" and "good" sunflower oils :)

5723 2018-08-22 15:04:24 I hate coming to get my oil changed and my dads not with me
5724 2018-08-22 15:04:23 No wonder most of my friends are in the oil, gas, coal and agricultural industries. 
5725 2018-08-22 15:04:22 Holy heck. I forgot how to use oil fucking pastels

5734 2018-08-22 15:03:53 I could get a 48”x72” oil painting portrait of myself for only 400 dollars 
5735 2018-08-22 15:03:48 I am not from US, My country was in socialist system and one phase or other of US sanctions  for 50 years and that too with a huge oil import bill and it literally destroyed my nation in the end if it had not been for economic liberalisation
5736 2018-08-22 15:03:47 Reliance has always done some thing first time, they never produce fiber, never oil, never refinery, sold grocery & they were success, so if they have won RAFALE deal, its not because of Modi but because they are Reliance!
5737 2018-08-22 15:03:37 Holding a position through the EIA release is one scenario, opening one ahead of can be viewed as reckless, or acting inappropriately with your account. Plenty of other opportunities through out the week. Consistency over Excitement

5739 2018-08-22 15:03:28 Hmm nowonder so much hatred display by Deji. Guess Buhari blocked some oil block fraudsters. Sure the haters are the culprits milking the nation's oil block shady contracts. Deji I smell rat from your end
5740 2018-08-22 15:03:22 What kind of War you would define Financial sanctions  . All leading Nations who are buyer or supplier of Oil are facing sanctions .
5741 2018-08-22 15:03:21 Oil is a bonus. We have much more than oil,certainly more than many other successful small nations. What does the rest of the UK have?
5742 2018-08-22 15:03:13 I'm all for essential oils - but patchouli oil belongs in the trashcan and in the trashcan only.
5743 2018-08-22 15:03:09 Short term; OIL ;)
5744 2018-08-22 15:02:59 Olive oil has been a staple for centuries. IMO the problem lies in the processed prepackaged foods that use all kinds of additives and way too much sodium, that adversely effect some people. A lot disease is also genetic.
5745 2018-08-22 15:02:48 Truffle oil is crack. I'm convinced
5746 2018-08-22 15:02:40 For sure. I like that he’s made the most of his opportunity. Personally & professionally. It’s also especially funny seeing how Oil fans embraced him after being public enemy #1 after the Gagner incident
5747 2018-08-22 15:02:35 We have to make sure that OIL keeps flowing at any cost.
5748 2018-08-22 15:02:29 Where was she found? I short vision of a water tower (tank) and a corner field and there was a black spot maybe oil. It spot didn't seem to wash away fast with the rain. I didn't say anything because people might think I'm nutty and or was the one. Went to Strugis '99

5765 2018-08-22 15:01:22 As with anything, be moderate. I’ve been using coconut oil for a few years and my cholesterol levels are fine. I also don’t eat huge amounts of it everyday, and I’m vegan transitioning to vegetarian.

5775 2018-08-22 15:00:58 If deforestation caused by overconsumption is your enemy, why punish Palm Oil farmers for it by banning their products? taxing veg oils won’t reduce usage in businesses but just inc tax revenues.

5791 2018-08-22 14:59:11 Yup. And we have been using oil based paint for trim, which I am particularly fond of. A smidge more expense up front, but a much better result. Wears very well.

5794 2018-08-22 14:59:06 That rewarding feeling you get from changing your own oil >>>>
5795 2018-08-22 14:59:02 Not snake oil...National sovreignty!
5796 2018-08-22 14:58:55 quicker clean up, the oil can't come out fast enough
5797 2018-08-22 14:58:54 Nothing mild about it. Plenty of studies clearly correlating high LDL with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Coconut oil pushes up 'good' HDL, but also 'bad' LDL. Use sparingly.
5798 2018-08-22 14:58:39 GERS: Scotland’s onshore revenue in 17/18 up by £2billion. Oil revenues up by £1bn. Total revenue tops £60bn for the first time.
5799 2018-08-22 14:58:38 I totally agree our sambar rice with pure ghee n curdrice with pure ghee very healthy dishes...Coconut oil and pure ghee very healthy
5800 2018-08-22 14:58:29 Bad haze in Borneo last few weeks as what's left of the world's second largest tropical forest and second largest carbon store burns to make way for yet more palm oil. It is grim.
5801 2018-08-22 14:58:25 แต่ไม่ตรงสายพี่ออยอ่ะ ถ้าตรงสายน่าจะเรียกเงินได้อีกรึเปล่า
5802 2018-08-22 14:58:09 I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right? 

P.S. #EnergyDominance is a GOP hoax to gut #publiclands and #wildlife protections so the GOP's Big Oil donors can make record profits exporting oil around the globe.
5803 2018-08-22 14:58:04 For 1000s of years people in South India and South east Asia have cooked ,bathed , drunk , smeared , slept ,massaged in coconut oil . They are the healthiest of the lot. So please spare the BS. You need to Dona real research !!!

5805 2018-08-22 14:57:51 Tips kurus tapi takde time: always pre-prepared your breakfast or lunch or dinner the night before. Aku masak semua sekali less than an hour je. Bukan nak kena masak kari. Salt and pepper, kadang2 sesame oil je. Kalau takde masa gak, kau ingat kau Mahathir? Gi mati lah!
5806 2018-08-22 14:57:40 Я на тебя плохо влияю
5807 2018-08-22 14:57:40 They also forget that Modi had golden goose of low oil price and additional revenue (not passing the benefit to people) was used for pump drive public investment since private investment is low.
5808 2018-08-22 14:57:34 Bullshit! The people here cook food with coconut oil, use it for hair and body, this is part of the culture for centuries, I haven't seen anyone calling coconut oil poison. May that person got some allergies
5809 2018-08-22 14:57:18 Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other countries that supply Canada with oil should be included on logo until we have an energy policy that uses Canadian oil in place of foreign oil 
5810 2018-08-22 14:57:13 A man coldly killed family & submerged their bodies in oil. He is a citizen & was embraced & comforted by his community before they realized his crimes. Using Rivera's immigrant status (& blaming Democrats as enablers) is ridiculous!
5811 2018-08-22 14:56:46 It’s just like how Indians were obsessed with Extra Virgin cold pressed Pure Italian Olive Oil. Dei too much da. One clever company even makes Olive Oil based pickles. Worstuuuu when I imagine the taste only.
5812 2018-08-22 14:56:41 That's what @dipika_bajpai said in a sarcastic. Coconut oil is the best oil
5813 2018-08-22 14:56:35 Monthly charts of coffee, soybeans, cattle,sugar,etc all look like silver.
I dont think anyone is suppressing it. They legitimately believe it will keep going down,because $ will only keep flowing into stocks. It's a heavily levered wrong bet,like funds who were buying oil at 150
5814 2018-08-22 14:56:34 e.g. Eggs, Fats, Breast Feeding, Coconut Oil, Marijuana, etc. etc.!....
5815 2018-08-22 14:56:33 and do I have a harrumph for #BRENT #Oil +2.1% looking to break above downtrend line.  #Dollar hold the cards in this game...

This oil has many uses.

5821 2018-08-22 14:55:59 You personally may not be but most people worked up about this are racially intolerant.  Get worked up about oil subsidies, there is millions more govt spends in other areas far more questionable.

5825 2018-08-22 14:55:36 I will use coconut oil. I don't care what some Harvard prof thinks
5826 2018-08-22 14:55:30 Agreed. Coconut oil is the best oil in the world. Easiest of all to digest. Much better than Olive Oil.
5827 2018-08-22 14:55:28  u must be a fool to say that every riches in yhe world comes from Africa Gold diamond oil cast Cooper coal uranium and so on uk usa china etc stole from africa ode omo
5828 2018-08-22 14:55:27 I'm curious as to why you think oil pipelines, solar panels & wind turbines can be blown up but coal burning power plants & coal mines can't. 

Just ask Don Blankenship about what happens when coal mines blow up.
5829 2018-08-22 14:55:20 My oil change is 30 bucks for the new oil for a 40 year old jeep
5830 2018-08-22 14:55:16 oil gonna rip into the $70's no reason to go down the rest of the week
5831 2018-08-22 14:55:01 e very play nas partes que dão pleasure, e maybe alguns toys tb, muito oil ou até butter em casos de urgencia mas nunca let it dry
5832 2018-08-22 14:54:57 Exactly...where on earth could we get oil to replace Saudi oil? I mean...Noone will sell us any extra oil...right!? Lol. Fear mongering. Canada has its own oil but other countries will increase demands anyway..anytime. A switch to renewables and they can all go pound sand.
5833 2018-08-22 14:54:57 I'm curious about the very particular Boomers who ignore these things... the politicians, oil and gas and car execs, etc. Were they the ones who hated hippies in their youth? Or did they change so much themselves?

5837 2018-08-22 14:54:38 I want an oil  tonight? 
5838 2018-08-22 14:54:34 This AM in the locker room at my gym a gal pulled out a straight up jar of coconut oil to lotion up with. I like coco oil as a moisturizer too but lugging a jar around in your gym bag is an impressive commitment.
5839 2018-08-22 14:54:31 What do you use to moisturize it, is it the coconut oil that you mentioned?
5840 2018-08-22 14:54:21 Coconut oil is canceled!
5841 2018-08-22 14:53:57 My ancestors have lived their entire life cooking with coconut oil. I too love few dishes prepared with coconut oil .
5842 2018-08-22 14:53:46 Dear iqrar bhai you are doing a great jobs for making our country green but I want to suggest you to pass on this message to the present government  that we must plant excessive amounts of Olive trees for commercial bases for making olive oil and  export purposes.
5843 2018-08-22 14:53:44 I had the same problem for years- I started celexa as well it has helped me with some things but there are side effects with it that I hate! i think my dad at the sportshack sells the cbd oil i’m gonna look into getting some myself as well!
5844 2018-08-22 14:53:40 And? How would California react if they regulated Hollywood out of business. Or Texas with Oil.. Or Pa with steel? These people relied on coal to survive. What do you expect them to support? Maybe they should all move to the desert and work in "big solar energy"?
5845 2018-08-22 14:53:32 Currently on my 2nd tub, best i prefer balm rather than oil, so takde nak spill bila travel. But ada mineral oil, try yang travel size dulu. Heimish takde mineral oil, travel size pun ada.
5846 2018-08-22 14:53:17 I need to get up so I can get this oil change
5847 2018-08-22 14:53:11 AP was made treasurer with an eye on Gujarat funds. @RahulGandhi or @INCIndia do not talk on oil, telecom issues as own nefarious deeds will be out. Rafael is shield to cover up sins or extract as much funds as possible. AA, in a letter, mentioned his cozy relations with Cong.
5848 2018-08-22 14:52:51 People are not on vacation...less oil demand...no major wars...wind turbine everywhere...less oil demand...electric cars...less oil demand...these reports are useless and all lies...FLEECING AMERICA !!!
5849 2018-08-22 14:52:51 Refined foods (which includes oil) coincides with most chronic diseases and obesity.  Just use common sense-eat as unprocessed as possible
5850 2018-08-22 14:52:43 AWWWW SANA OIL
5851 2018-08-22 14:52:39 You forgot to mention U.S sanctions on a non compliant oil rich nation

5854 2018-08-22 14:52:22 It'd be interesting to look at heart disease rates somewhere like Southern India (eg: Kerala or Tamil Nadu), where nearly everything gets cooked in coconut oil, to see how they compare to a Western European nation such as Italy or Greece, where Olive Oil is the default choice.
5855 2018-08-22 14:52:15 Post-EIA stat WTI chatroom update #OOTT Ongoing volatility in last 19 min indicates need of lithium to calm participants.  Bears took initial victory laps but then bulls did same.  Some chatters regret post-stat commentary.  Forex guy asked where oil/gas rigs were near Hawaii.
5856 2018-08-22 14:52:14 Eire !. Bertie Aherne and his criminal mates "GAVE" away the citizens oil rights for FREE to their mates in Shell.
That is just one of many reasons but a big one.

5860 2018-08-22 14:52:04 Strait of Hormuz?

The Strait is a strategic waterway for oil shipments which Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have threatened to block in response to Trump administration calls to ban all Iranian oil exports.
5861 2018-08-22 14:51:57 
5862 2018-08-22 14:51:46 I don't understand one thing with the people. When they thought in 1960s etc fats are evil, there were sugar loaded fad diets with minimal fats. Not even 'good' fats were allowed. Now the carb is the new villain & people gorge on coconut oil & butter without a second thought.
5863 2018-08-22 14:51:24 Oil supply is a national security issue. Our economy is far too dependant on sale of resources and constantly sells them raw and unrefined. Even though we have lots of crude we have little fuel produced here. Then there are the prices we pay after the gas or diesel comes back.
5864 2018-08-22 14:51:17 Pag nagpapakulo kasi ng pasta para lumambot nilalayan ng konting oil para Hindi magdikit dikit habang lumalambot sya

5868 2018-08-22 14:50:42 Congratulations, Lisa and Verne! I hope your policy-making in DC reflects your respect for Alaska's natural beauty. Please say "no" to #pebblemine and the opening of the #ANWR for oil drilling.

5870 2018-08-22 14:50:37 I drink motor oil. 10w-40 I get it from Subway.
5871 2018-08-22 14:50:24 I was interested in taking the trade myself after you posted it. Was stalking a few different setups in oil stocks. Problem was I was at the mall when you posted and then forgot about it 

Just $SIVB $WWE. Both just missed target and are reversing now 
5872 2018-08-22 14:50:04 Oil prices lifted today due to a fall in commercial inventories of 5.8Mb on the week.
5873 2018-08-22 14:50:01 Coconut oil? Yes or No. Hearing two sides to it. Been taking a tablespoon every day. Should I stop?

5875 2018-08-22 14:49:49 Keen on economics ?

Read up about what would happen if pound wasn't linked to an oil producing country

BTW it's already in the toilet because of brexit....
5876 2018-08-22 14:49:44 I agree the oil will help. Is it going to be a perfect fit for you and the pony? Maybe lowball them?
5877 2018-08-22 14:49:41 pernah beli uv perfect gel dan tak sesuai.  aha bha face wash dia yg oil & acne control, dedua pun tak sesuai.
5878 2018-08-22 14:49:40 I bought my coworker’s birthday present with another coworker today. It is an aroma oil. It smells very nice.
5879 2018-08-22 14:49:37 Tried a new place today for an oil change

5881 2018-08-22 14:49:20 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
5882 2018-08-22 14:49:16 I make my own tortilla chips from the Siete almond and cassava tortillas.  Just lightly rub with oil, salt, cut in triangles, and toast in a low oven until dry and crisp turning halfway through.  It's a little time consuming but compliant!  And this way you don't eat too many!
5883 2018-08-22 14:49:11 Big drawdown in US oil inventories: 5.8 mln barrels, which puts big dent into the previous week's 6.8 mln barrel build.  Some went to larger than expected builds in gasoline and distillates.  Cushing took in 772k barrels. It is the first back-to-back gain since May. Crude higher.
5884 2018-08-22 14:49:11 Body oil goes great in the hair for the #slickbackedlook instead of on the body. Not how I wanted to start my Wednesday...... #kardashianhair #dontthinkicanhandle
5885 2018-08-22 14:49:08 For a second straight week, U.S. oil refineries operated at 98.1% of available capacity, their most for this (33rd) week of the year since 1998. #OOTT
5886 2018-08-22 14:49:05 Thriving? You mean the highest taxes in the world and dependence on oil revenues and mounting debt and substandard everything. Then yes it’s thriving.
5887 2018-08-22 14:49:02 Renewed? The GOP donors, Trump, FOX, & Prince are just coming from a different angle. They want Iran's oil. Bolton & the GOP took MEK off the terror list a few years ago for a regime change deal over oil. Prince's Seychelles meetings? Russia, Saudi Arabia, & UAE at Trump's behest
5888 2018-08-22 14:49:01 Yaguaraparo, Irapa y Güiria, son ciudades al sur de la Península de Paria.

5889 2018-08-22 14:48:57 Not true. The invention of cars running on water was invented decades ago. Now they can run on corn oil and batteries too.
You can't drink oil or eat money
Watch  Stephen Hawkings 'Favorite places".
5890 2018-08-22 14:48:44 Sebelumnya udah tes sih pake tea tree oil pny temen kantor dan langsung seneng. Ditambah sampe hr ini alhamdulillah msh fine2 aja
5891 2018-08-22 14:48:38 Charlatans will always sell snake oil
5892 2018-08-22 14:48:37 Which is as dumb as the Brexit, instead they could do what Norway does, export most of the oil and use renewable energy for yourself and support population going electric for transportation.
5893 2018-08-22 14:48:26 The IEA, in their own words, publishes scenarios, not predictions. So yes, probably "As long as we rely on markets with policy that tinkers," EV tech and deployment will be slow. I'd just say be careful with tweets like "Electricity won't displace oil for decades."
5894 2018-08-22 14:48:14 I believe this is True--but I have taken the Fruit too--When the Surpent
told me to. Please Mr. President--Pour out the Snake Oil and Repent!!
5895 2018-08-22 14:48:14 So mad at myself for doubting the power of vaping CBD oil for my anxiety and all the things that come with it. 

This is blissfullness 
5896 2018-08-22 14:48:02 Alaskans own 11,781 shares of MURPHY USA INC, worth $864,961. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

5899 2018-08-22 14:47:49 You got it, and I haven’t thrown stones in years. I built in old stone alter down there by the cornfield and tore my rotator, but my faith was small that day, we rubbed wd-1611 on it and it’s all better. WD-1611 is the original WD-40, the Kings oil!
5900 2018-08-22 14:47:45 This's nuts. Obviously paid propaganda. One Indian Cardio thoracic surgeon says coconut oil has all things that mother's milk has.This Doctor once dependent on insulin injections completely got rid of diabetes with consuming coconut oil with low carb deit.
5901 2018-08-22 14:47:35 #Ramaphosa The issue of fuel is a function of what happens in the world in terms of the prices in the dollar and oil, and there was a moment where we thought we would have a decline that would lead to having the price coming down and that did not happen. #RamaphosaQandA
5902 2018-08-22 14:47:32 Mine is also very low, which I attribute to genetics.  I am wary of things that are held up as evil, then great, and back and forth.  Butter and eggs got a lot of undeserved criticism, for example.  I am just not sure coconut oil should be considered as virtuous as touted.
5903 2018-08-22 14:47:26 Yup , double cleansing sebab nak make sure muka kau betul2 clean . Tapi tak semua orang sesuai dengan cleansing oil . Kau kena try an error lah setiap oil cleanser ( Hada labo / Simple ) both ni takda mineral oil . Tapi aku dah serik haha . So aku tk guna oil cleanser .

5905 2018-08-22 14:47:09 INCIDENT REPORT as of 10:46 PM: Incident at NB Elevated (fronting Sea Oil). Causing Heavy Traffic along NB direction.
5906 2018-08-22 14:47:06 And you are buying pipelines, giving the oil sands 100Mt of our carbon budget - a budget that has to be made more ambitious.  You can do better.
5907 2018-08-22 14:47:05 why are fish oil vitamins the size of my hand? 
5908 2018-08-22 14:47:04 There is a lot of research and opinion that refutes this. Guide is moderation. The human system evolved around meat eating. We are natural carnivores. Some oils better than others. I like straight oils, not blends. FYI veg oil should be 100% soybean oil. Olive oil is the best.
5909 2018-08-22 14:47:02 I thought it was a good read.  Misses some key aspects like China de-stocking and impact of a rising $DXY, but there is no doubt that KSA is walking a tightrope here to keep oil prices in a price band that makes everyone happy.
5910 2018-08-22 14:46:49 @realDonaldTrump oil prices are getting to high and where are term limits?
5911 2018-08-22 14:46:32 Check your Engine oil today.
5912 2018-08-22 14:46:24 We need to drill oil is gold.
5913 2018-08-22 14:46:15 Ha ha. Your a total dope. 111% of our oil revenues came to Scotland last year. If you weren’t so dumb I would explain it to you. 

And the number 111% is correct.
5914 2018-08-22 14:45:52 That’s statement about women and checking oil
5915 2018-08-22 14:45:49 Interesting to hear that growth in Cannabis CBD Oil sales since a degree of legalisation is leading to industry consolidation. European brand CannabiGold is being bought by Canada's Green Organic Dutchman Holdings, for $15.5m, with $12m in incentives and $10.2m cash investment.
5916 2018-08-22 14:45:44 Neel inflation is not showing up in prices based on the flawed way the CPI is Calc'd. Every bill I have opened over the past 12 months has increased way more than 2%! insurance, housing costs, Oil, restaurant food. Your heuristics don't fool anyone, you are way behind the curve!
5917 2018-08-22 14:45:43 why gasoline oil and distillates are rallying after another bearish report I will never understand.  Must be amateur hour in oil trading land nowadays. #oott
5918 2018-08-22 14:45:25 Oil, the main cost of mining, is now twice as expensive as last time silver was 14$. Silver would still be a cheap buy,in low 20s $GLD $SLV
5919 2018-08-22 14:45:25 These are all coconut, flakes, milk and oil, so I have high hopes for them. These are kept frozen which will help curb my damn ice cream cravings I hope.
5920 2018-08-22 14:45:23 No, because the Japanese could get oil from the Dutch East Indies which they invaded, the day after Pearl Harbor.  Why would they think attacking a US base would get them oil.
5921 2018-08-22 14:45:15 Bio oil sangat memantul. Lavvv 
5922 2018-08-22 14:45:01 Wehh yeke? Aku banyak benda tak tahu lagi ni rupanya  sebab aku ada baca, if tumbuh jerawat pasir, kena try double cleansing and kena guna oil cleanser. Noobnya aku 
5923 2018-08-22 14:44:54 ７月１０日はオイルの日。
「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから。
5924 2018-08-22 14:44:49 It took WAY too long to find olive oil.
It really sucks searching for something new in a store.
5925 2018-08-22 14:44:43 No no....they have oil, so it’s ok
5926 2018-08-22 14:44:42 iyaa dicampur, aku kan suka pake dipergelangan tangan gitu jadi biar gk lengket makanya aku campur baby oil
5927 2018-08-22 14:44:41 Yes our OIL is one thing that truly deserves a Butchers’ Apron on it. WM takes it all to buy REd/Blue Tory election results.

5933 2018-08-22 14:44:15 No oil...
5934 2018-08-22 14:44:14 So UK annual deficit is £40billion.

Scotland has £13billion
RUK has £27billion.

So 5.25million people rack up £2467 per head where as 55million only rack up £490 per head yet we have 90% of UK oil and 25% of all food and drink exports alone?

What a crock of shit!

Apparently the ground didn't move that much when cash-strapped, inflation-ridden but oil rich Venezuela had a powerful earthquake this morning. No reports of damage, casualties or tsunamis...so far.

5940 2018-08-22 14:43:55 The dead body of young pregnant mom in a shallow grave, the dead bodies of her beautiful daughters immersed in an oil tank,  killed by their white American husband and dad. Don't ever forget the names Shannann, Bella, Celeste and unborn Nico Watts.

5942 2018-08-22 14:43:39 You're all over my timeline but I'll answer this one #CommaMan 

1) Oil isn't worth a pot to piss in for the last few years but you were told at the 2014 referendum that our economy couldn't rely on oil.

5945 2018-08-22 14:42:59 Isn’t the procedure for changing the oil the same for most cars? 
Besides she said basics. Just think it would have been helpful.
5946 2018-08-22 14:42:58 Those sources cost A LOT more and only yield electricity intermittently.  People use coal and oil because it’s cheap and it’s always “on”.  These are facts, not my opinion.

5964 2018-08-22 14:41:19 Yeah I always sear them before slow-cooking. So you'll get a nice golden roasty look and a crunchier outside. Some cast iron pan and olive oil, sear, then into the slow cooker.
5965 2018-08-22 14:41:13 So 8% of the oil revenue will increase to 100%. What will rUK do without that I ask you, what will they do without duty in our spirits I ask you. @theSNP

2 - no disruption so far to the oil refinery, which produces ~16% of UK fuels... the fire is in a @Shell higher olefins plant, elsewhere on the site

6000 2018-08-22 14:38:23 No it is my belief gold follows the real rate not inflation, higher oil prices are good for gold because breakevens follow them. 
essentially in my framework Gold/$ = Real rate differential on the gold side and DXY on the other side.

6006 2018-08-22 14:37:56 Never took drivers ed but just feel people can learn this on their own. Everything is  on YouTube. And stuff like changing the oil isn’t going to be the same in every car brand/year. Makes it difficult for the instructor. And students wouldn’t want to learn about every car.
6007 2018-08-22 14:37:50 I did oil cleansing for four months- using just olive oil which transformed my skin! Now I use a goats milk based all natural soap or aveeno.

6012 2018-08-22 14:37:32 I'm all for helping folk in times of immediate aid for emergencies such as fire, flood and earthquake...

6016 2018-08-22 14:37:16 It's because they have not eaten roasted coconut yet. So cholesterol has been cleared now y'all are picking on coconut oil.

6027 2018-08-22 14:36:08 Inflation expectations are still running hot with surging oil prices, for gold to rise again you need to wait for the deflationary mindset to settle in again, both yields and gold should rise.
6028 2018-08-22 14:36:03 Its America who has screwed Venezuela.they don't want socialists weakening their neoliberal way of life where capitalism is king for those fortunate few.The Venezuelan rich didn't like to see the socialist government actually sharing the oil wealth building schools and hospitals.
6029 2018-08-22 14:36:01 Think Venezuela is also fairly oil rich. Look what happened there where the loons got hold of the economy.
6030 2018-08-22 14:35:51 Would be interesting to see a study of only plant eaters vs meat eaters. I do have coconut oil and dairy replacements that contain coconut oil, but my LDL is showing as even lower than it was since I gave up dairy.

6070 2018-08-22 14:32:25 You have this silly idea that if the US would end financial sanctions, everyone would give them money. China and Russia don't have to obey US sanctions and aren't lending either. They can't repay. The oil price collapsed. The inability to repay existing debt preceded sanctions.

6187 2018-08-22 14:21:44 How crazy is it that people are willing to drink and bathe in dirty water because they bootlick oil companies?
6188 2018-08-22 14:21:32 Bullshit.!! 
First they remove Linseed oil from Indian food and now selling linseed oil capsules why? because it has high capacity to reduce cholesterol 
and now saying about coconut oil !!
totally chutiya Harvard professor!
6189 2018-08-22 14:21:31 Virgin Coconut Oil is filled and sold as capsules in America. Very high price

6192 2018-08-22 14:21:07 Last I looked, London looked full of middle eastern sheiks and Russian oil czars. Both groups with a lot more £'s than Brits themselves.  That means they can buy the Brit pols.. same problem in USA, but it's sheiks & chinese buying American pols...
6193 2018-08-22 14:21:01 Haters put super glue in my face oil because I'm pretty, they try to make me fat cause my shape is nice and want to turn me into a crack head because I refuse to let these fake men keep me barefoot and pregnant. I don't be procreating with lames.
6194 2018-08-22 14:21:01 Go and check well, owerri is arguably the cleanest city so far,  anambra is building an international airport,  also a sea port and construction is on for an oil refinery... Should I tell you more?
6195 2018-08-22 14:20:56 I try to keep my net carbs under 50g/day which is pretty easy, but I haven't been fanatical about it. High fat like avocado and olive oil and butter, and moderate protein.
6196 2018-08-22 14:20:51 Oil is lighter than water hence it floats. Let that sink in.
6197 2018-08-22 14:20:42 @oil_oncanvass yours is .

6204 2018-08-22 14:20:11 Cheshire Fire say 6 engines have been called to reports of a fire at Stanlow Oil Refinery in Ellesmere Port. Crews are working with onsite firefighters to extinguish the fire which is believed to be in a manufacturing building within the plant. All staff have been accounted for.

6206 2018-08-22 14:19:54 OK
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
so power grab is it keep the clown shoes on or get the running shoes on?
6207 2018-08-22 14:19:51 Spray oil sheen on it & run it in & it’ll come off.

According to your HEROES, it said 4yrs of oil revenue & they ineptly compared it with 3yrs of theirs. 
Do you want to CRASE like them?

6221 2018-08-22 14:18:46 He’s not our friend. He doesn’t know anything and doesn’t listen to advisors. Their party is irrelevant and old and are criminals so desperate to cling to power they’ll resort to anything. No ethics or morals, the preacher selling snake oil in cowboy movies who has to skip town.
6222 2018-08-22 14:18:44 Always be smoking a cigar and holding a wine glass, while standing in front of a massive oil painting of you smoking a cigar and holding a wine glass... preferably in a tuxedo with a secret room behind the painting. Hope I helped
6223 2018-08-22 14:18:44 Eat shit and drink your oil.

6225 2018-08-22 14:18:39 Oh give me a freaking break. It's not like he'd be pardoning a fugitive who was indicted on over 60 criminal counts, including trading with Iran during an oil embargo, while Americans were being held hostage.

6228 2018-08-22 14:18:25 All I do is get the oil changed  everything else I’m lost
6229 2018-08-22 14:18:12 look I woke up either today or yesterday, idk what time is anymore, and saw something about a gov spill and assumed it was an oil spill lmao but today I learned it's not and we might be getting a new prime minister and all I have to say is what the FUCK is going on!?!?!?!?
6230 2018-08-22 14:18:12 The key is the peanut oil that they use to cook the fries. OMG.

6239 2018-08-22 14:17:29 Baka aglio olio or something ang niluluto nya. You still need to fry the garlic in oil tapos ilalagay mo yung pasta, along with pasta water. Baka dun sya natalsikan.

6242 2018-08-22 14:17:11 There were a lot of self-proclaimed economists in India who praised "Venezuela model" back in Chavez days when he was merrily running a welfare state with oil money, without worrying about infra spending and growing economy to sustain those subsidies.

6245 2018-08-22 14:17:02 The world needs to tell MbS, the new guy, that this isn't on, oil or no oil.
6246 2018-08-22 14:17:00 Oh I don't know but the 8 counts will put him in jail for the rest of his life not so much of a witch hunt you can say all you want you can bark at your crowd all you want you are nothing but a side show carnie and the snake oil you are selling don't work. Do us all a favor quit.
6247 2018-08-22 14:16:52 Venezuela was in a state before the oil price crash. And socialism has never worked - ask anybody who has lived in a country that's tried it.  Comparing Britain to Venezuela is absurd, & it wasn't our reliance on financial services that caused our problems.
6248 2018-08-22 14:16:47 Criminal conspiracy is different, they’re piling up. Obama never paid hush money to cover up paying for ass . Know the difference, thanks for the false equivalency there. Trump’s a con man, he sold you all snake oil.

does that also affect your allergies?
6262 2018-08-22 14:15:41 haha hooray for different triggers

It's not the perfumes for me, it's parabens mostly, and any soap that's more astringent than a well-cured olive oil soap. I have to go out of my way for sensitive skin.
6263 2018-08-22 14:15:39 I think he must talk to Dr B.M.Hegde. He may enlighten him on the virtues of Coconut oil.

6272 2018-08-22 14:14:50 The oil in Texas belongs to Texas, and not the United States. Likewise, the oil in Sabah and Sarawak belongs to the two states, not Malaysia, and they must control and decide what they do with the oil.

6274 2018-08-22 14:14:40 We only have to look to Norway, who has an oil fund that is now worth around $1 trillion. They own around 1.4% of all the shares in the world.

6277 2018-08-22 14:14:18 BE CAREFUL if you are in any OIL stocks right now as the latest Oil inventory report is being announced in 20 minutes.  Usually the Oil sector (and applicable individual stocks) react strongly to this report.

Use your TI oil sector scan to monitor price movement live.

6279 2018-08-22 14:14:01 Oh yes they would promote cutting down all the Amazon rain forest to plant palm trees for their precious palm and coconut oil.
6280 2018-08-22 14:13:50 This definitely cannot be correct. Sri Lankans consume on average 20 litres of coconut oil per annum, but heart disease is not more common than in most other countries.

6282 2018-08-22 14:13:46 Yes. if India realizes its full (Rice Bran Oil) RBO potential then we can significantly reduce this & reverse this too. In fact India exported from 10k tons of RBO back in FY 2016

6318 2018-08-22 14:10:41 I hate adulting. I just paid $70 for a damn oil change. I could have bought four candles for that price!

6320 2018-08-22 14:10:26 Sorry - but while cannabis oil might support recovery for PTSD, there are a lot of other factors that are essential for positive progression towards health .... please do not exclude the importance and productivity of human support and therapy ....
6321 2018-08-22 14:10:25 You might need the paste more than once. Also, if you like tinned sardines in oil these can help. My cat loves coconut oil as a treat & l think it helps too.
6322 2018-08-22 14:10:24 Non FM guys but would appreciate advice - had car services at Vauxhall full service £167 and they're charging extra now for coolant and brake fluid top ups does that sound right? They've only changed oil and filter and topped up the washer by sounds of it! Feel like a right mug

6324 2018-08-22 14:10:12 Remember,same as oil rises above water, truth will surely surface. The more lies you tell, the more serious the consequences #TruthMattersAlways
6325 2018-08-22 14:10:11 No, Les, the only entity in the universe claiming the Scottish Government takes £50b of oil revenue and puts it on a ship and sends it to an unknown region is you.
6326 2018-08-22 14:10:04 A hamster on a wheel burning the midnight oil, I does it moving...
6327 2018-08-22 14:10:03 Do i need to bring my brush & coconut oil to work
6328 2018-08-22 14:09:50 Government says it is exploring alternative ways of procuring oil to curb the rising fuel prices. South Africans are paying over 16 rand a litre inland for 95 octane petrol.
6329 2018-08-22 14:09:44 Under the current structure within the UK oil companies don't pay for the oil, they get it for free.

To ping your question back to you.

Do you think the oil belongs to the oil companies or to the people is Scotland....or indeed UK, as it currently stands?
6330 2018-08-22 14:09:37 No medam aap vegetarin nahi ho aap jo sabji khati ho use kido se Bach ne ke liye dawai dali jati hai US se kahi kide marte hai to aap ne un katal kiya kese vegetain ho OR aap jo bhi oil use karti ho US ME jarbi mix ki jati hai aap kese vegetarin ho
6331 2018-08-22 14:09:33 There is no evidence that LDL causes CVD other than it is present. Same % of people with high LDL and low LDL get CVD. One should not have an opinion without studying coconut oil or having personally experienced it's effect
6332 2018-08-22 14:09:31 How about same colour pattern done as oil painting, framed, just the word, “painting”
6333 2018-08-22 14:09:28 Ano such a nightmare hahaha hopefully i only have it through the pregnancy and it goes away after lol, naw actually better be me or im gonny go invest in some lavender oil hahahaha

6336 2018-08-22 14:09:19 ฉันก็คิดดดดดด
6337 2018-08-22 14:08:58 If oil, coal & natural gas were not fast running out then maybe I would agree, but currently IMO money spent developing more efficient renewable energy systems, the better.
6338 2018-08-22 14:08:47 @shayneTward hey Mr. Ward, do you still need some of the best beard oil on the market....I have a bottle that has your name on it. If you would like a free sample.....no strings, so to speak. Let me know. philipw@totem-wolf.co.uk

6344 2018-08-22 14:08:12 I love the red oil jollof rice, dried fish, pepper, red oil, the popular scent leaf, Maggi, salt, onion, locust bean..
6345 2018-08-22 14:08:07 Of course there’s more than oil and tourism, but even if there wasn’t, I’d still rather that than England’s gamble of holding onto Scotland to keep it afloat.
6346 2018-08-22 14:08:03  best pasta I ever had was free in a bar in Florence, basically, pine nuts, Parmesan, basil, garlic & olive oil. I try to make it.
6347 2018-08-22 14:08:02 Good Morning Everyone!  Are you overdue on that oil change? How about a tune up? We can get ya fixed up no problem. Give us a call Split Head Auto Repair And Customization
6348 2018-08-22 14:08:01 its the go to oil in rural  areas
6349 2018-08-22 14:07:59 What is more ironic is that tons of Aam junta consume refined distilled pomace Olive dregs junk rather than the healthy virgin variety since it is marketed as heat stable for frying :) Groundnut oil is far healthier and superior.
6350 2018-08-22 14:07:58 Strangled them with his bare hands and dumped them in oil pits. A spouse I can at least see losing one's temper, ins $$ or something....but your own children???!!!! Who call you daddy. My mind just can't comprehend.
6351 2018-08-22 14:07:55 Pushing back at Gatwick. Can smell the oil from here #UKOG
6352 2018-08-22 14:07:41 Sana oil! Hahahaha
6353 2018-08-22 14:07:31 Yes a failure on the Venezuelan government to rely heavily on oil. That’s not socialism’s fault, just bad economic management - the same as Britain relying heavily on financial services so when the system collapses it brought the rest of the country to its knees
6354 2018-08-22 14:07:27 Oh wait...got a better one..

PALM OIL!!!
6355 2018-08-22 14:07:13 And bidens son ran an oil company in Ukraine, not to mention podesta's was manaforts boss during his work in Ukraine

6357 2018-08-22 14:07:06 Brent oil hits 2-week high +$74 a barrel due to drop in U.S. crude inventories & upcoming U.S. sanctions on OPEC producer Iran pointing to tighter supplies.
6358 2018-08-22 14:07:05 -2 defend themselves against Russia, we bombed Syria (Russia’s ally when the gassed they ppl) and we now directly compete with Russia to provide oil and natural gas for the EU.

6361 2018-08-22 14:06:46 An old uncle told me that is good for our health. Besides everybody recommends to use olive oil and the mediterranean cuisine. It starts the engine early.
6362 2018-08-22 14:06:44 This is the biggest debt trap in history. Hope it is foiled as soon as possible. With the rise in oil prices, they are further putting down countries one after the other with bankruptcy. Shame! Confucius is ashamed! Lao Tsi is ashamed!

6371 2018-08-22 14:05:16 And why was the economy so reliant on oil?  And unable to withstand it?  And unable to recover?
6372 2018-08-22 14:05:00 Stop cooking them steam\Grill them in the oven put some olive oil and Vegetable seasoning then you good to go....
6373 2018-08-22 14:04:57 But the pure, sweet, sweet, fresh oil for the chicken wings?  Maybe that’s why?
6374 2018-08-22 14:04:53 not necessarily true.. rice bran oil production started in the early 70s. in a way its better than sunflower. its a byproduct of rice which farmers can monetize on, unlike Sunflower
6375 2018-08-22 14:04:52 Oh samaaaa ! Kita pun pakai hl cleansing oil . Lagi satu , hydrate your skin :)

6377 2018-08-22 14:04:40 Double cleansing ni you wash your face using oil cleanser, bilas, then use your second cleanser. Some cleansing oil/balm ada mineral oil, kalau orang takleh dengan mineral oil, nanti breakout. Tapi kakti muka bukan ada apa pun!
6378 2018-08-22 14:04:29 I know!  Because the Republican party endorses criminals for office.  That's why they are protecting a lying, snake oil selling, con artist.

6380 2018-08-22 14:04:18 That is the oil and gas from unkown source.
So 37BN not included in the GERS but unionists seem happy to still want union with the crooks who are stealing from scotland!
6381 2018-08-22 14:04:17 The export revenue ( I.e total value of export sales ) was underestimated for Scotland, prior to 2016. However this is only in RTS itself. The oil and gas export numbers come from the Snap oil & gas report and the tax revenue numbers come from GERS, neither of which use RTS.
6382 2018-08-22 14:04:12 It would be nice if the EU stepped up at this point since an allied Turkey is in their interests, but they're apparently too busy propping up the Iranian regime for the oil & the graft & the business contracts to be bothered w/NATO concerns.
6383 2018-08-22 14:04:09 You sound like a scared toddler screaming lie after lie and waiting for your sheep to believe and follow!  I didn’t realize religious zealots lost all ability to be rational and to see the truth when being sold snake oil
6384 2018-08-22 14:03:46 there are also ops that run near oil fields to tap into cheap excess natural gas. Wyoming could become not only the mining state of the us, but also a cryptomining state. lots of oil fields, wind, and high altitude fresh air for affordable cooling

6387 2018-08-22 14:03:30 It's always the competitor cooking oil companies who pay these professors to write these researches so that ppl stop using coconut oil and use their oil for cooking
6388 2018-08-22 14:03:17 Your "wall" wouldn't have stopped that clean cut, all American white guy from killing his pregnant wife, strangling his daughters and dumping their bodies in oil tanks would it?

6392 2018-08-22 14:03:02 I assume they did a deep dive into the Colorado white guy who murdered his wife & kids, dumped the kids in oil tanks, then claimed his wife killed them
6393 2018-08-22 14:02:57 Coal is going to die no matter who is in the White House. This isn't the 19th century anymore no matter how much you old farts wish it were. Just in case you were wondering, we're not bringing back VHS tapes, Blockbuster Video, or foregoing electricity in favor of oil lamps. Ok?

6395 2018-08-22 14:02:54 @SheaMoisture just would like to know what is the best product to use if I want to twist my natural hair as a style as I only use the castor oil line
6396 2018-08-22 14:02:43 Have you tried the garnier moisture bomb antioxidant bomb moisturizer? Or Vaseline to hold all your oil/cream in? Those usually help when I get big dry patches
6397 2018-08-22 14:02:25 Are you sure, a bit of a gamble on oil and 6 months of tourism. Who owns the oil companies and the seas anyway?

6404 2018-08-22 14:01:49 SPR is for a extreme situations like a regime change attempt (happened on Jimmy Carter) by oil exporting nations but US shale surpress the effect of oil price shock a bit. But US SPR are 660 mb that 11 is just ~2% of total.
6405 2018-08-22 14:01:48 I think reseachers really just don't know what there talking about. One day coconut oil is this magical oil, now it's posion. One day you need to drink 64oz of water daily. Now it was just a marketing scheme to sell more bottle water.
6406 2018-08-22 14:01:44 Like on God.. I don’t like this feeling of paying $100 for a oil change yo
6407 2018-08-22 14:01:43 it's just grape seed juice and if you're lucky, coconut oil.

6449 2018-08-22 13:57:33 Probably cause they can't afford to get at it. Can you imagine if they announced they had a potential £545m worth of oil in the ground, the share price would be 10p! Any major taking over will be wanting it that's for sure!

..how can a government with more than $90bn in oil revenue end up with a balance-of-payments crisis? Well, the answer is: it can’t, and won’t. #Venezuela 
....Hyperinflation is also a very remote possibility.... #Socialism
6452 2018-08-22 13:57:18 Pls invite me! I’ll bring my own aromatherapy oil
6453 2018-08-22 13:57:17 Thank you! I seem to remember what he said was: cut up tomatoes, put in bowl w/good olive oil, salt & pepper. Let sit. Place cooked pasta on top for maybe a minute, then stir. Sound right? I'm excited to try it. (& will look at this recipe, too!) Thanks!

6456 2018-08-22 13:56:57 Definitely loving the work part of this trip too.

Mexico has recently opened up their O&G industry which was previously 100% controlled by their national oil co.

But now, the possibilities are endless in this country & it becomes the new, exciting playground for many players.
6457 2018-08-22 13:56:56 I wholeheartedly dislike paying for oil changes

6460 2018-08-22 13:56:36 Interesting you have no criticisms about the white man who murdered his pregnant wife and two precious daughters then dumped them in oil tanks like trash. There are countless more men like him killing and threatening women’s lives than there are undocumented immigrant killers.

6465 2018-08-22 13:56:05 I’m going to work looking like a wet rat today bc I didn’t get all the hot oil out of my hair
6466 2018-08-22 13:55:52 ...with this administration's efforts on the currency swap with China, stopping the importation of rice to produce enough locally even for exports, to refine our oil locally and stop the importation of petroleum products, dollar will fall below #199 as we move on!
#VotePMBin2019.
6467 2018-08-22 13:55:36 Oh how quickly the American ppl forget that an AMERICAN white father just killed his pregnant wife #ShanannWatts & 2 daughters & stuffed them in an oil tank! Ppl kill ppl #MollieTibbetts didn’t deserve to die, let’s not make it a political battle!
6468 2018-08-22 13:55:31 To save themselves the banks will print like mad. The printing will devalue currencies, Crypto will go higher, oil will rise in mideast and fall in America as they can open SPR for 4 years with 600 million in bbl reserves. Crack-up Boom is heading our way. Brent/WTI gap widens Q4
6469 2018-08-22 13:55:28 Here comes the anti coconut oil propaganda. Then the new "superfood" oil. Then the cycle comes full circle again when coconut oil becomes the superfood again

6473 2018-08-22 13:55:08 I accidentally bought the wrong body wash, Oil Of Olay. I gotta say though, I smell heavenly after a shower! Like a lavender field. Problem is I feel like lighting candles round the house and posting stuff to Pinterest.
6474 2018-08-22 13:55:04 It's time that the don sees his way out. He's proved he is sexist and openly admitted to sexual assault. He is a snake oil salesmen. Trump u, trump steaks, trump casinos. He is a proven and convicted racist. The only people around him are convicted criminals.

6490 2018-08-22 13:53:26 I guess I'm confused between the cause and the effect. Isn't the main cause that 95% or so of the economy is based on oil production and prices have plummeted causing the govt to rely on financing and printing money?
6491 2018-08-22 13:53:25 บ่นหราาาา
6492 2018-08-22 13:53:23 OF COURSE i had to spill a couple of tiny little drops of oil from the cheese i was eating onto my macbook’s trackpad that’s now somewhat unresponsive...

6494 2018-08-22 13:53:18 It would be excellent if all trade between Canada and Saudi Arabia would cease, including oil purchases. I would encourage my country to boycott Saudi Arabia and even to ban travel there by Canadians.
6495 2018-08-22 13:53:15 Maybe it's the wrong question. Are Albertans (and Canadians) accepting a realistic  share of responsibility for past, present, and future harms caused by oil, gas, and tarsands development?

6502 2018-08-22 13:52:34 The marginal barrel outside of mid-east has a higher break even cost.
Oil will not be sold at a lower price than it costs to replace.
Oil has to rise to incentivize drilling risks and costs. 
Oil will drop, then rise, then rise very fastly= Demand will rise as price rises

6517 2018-08-22 13:50:52 Thats the reason why a lot of the energy / heat transition project in Germany can be won (or lost) in the renovation segment. 13M very old oil boilers alone need to be exchanged in terms of climate protection / energy efficiency!

6519 2018-08-22 13:50:40 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

6522 2018-08-22 13:50:25 100%. There are a lot of brands that don't use real olive oil. It is usually cut with some kind of refined poly-unsaturated vegetable oil. Or at the very least it is highly refined olive oil.
6523 2018-08-22 13:50:23 Turkey recieved oil from ISIS when it had possession of Raqqa and al omar fields. In addition to this, it is clear that Turkey views the PKK  more a threat to its National security than ISIS. It has also defacto assisted ISIS by attacking those who fight it [YPG].

6532 2018-08-22 13:49:24 Isaiah 61:3 - To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. #Word
6533 2018-08-22 13:49:16 Oh of course, I forgot the UK economy is completely reliant on dollars gained from selling oil to service our dollar denominated debt that accumulated because our exchange rate is pegged against the dollar. I must have blacked out when all this happened.
6534 2018-08-22 13:49:13 Higher Oil will kill trade. Higher Oil might lift some currencies and clobber others. Distance will cost more in Q4. Yet lower Oil priced feedstocks and new supplies can't be incentivized by industry until break-even occurs so we rely on the Mid-east, but they can't deliver all
6535 2018-08-22 13:49:13 Nonsense. Just more Kremlin anti-fracking agit-prop. And, it hasn't worked: US production is at record highs, oil prices haven't soared and Putin's plan to undermine the US is struggling.

6567 2018-08-22 13:45:25 We in kerala,India has been using coconut oil for cooking forever and has been healthy. 
It was however after replacing it with sunflower oil most of our people became cholesterol patients
6568 2018-08-22 13:45:19 Facts. Hell I walked all the way to motor oil company and I’d do that again too lmao that wasn’t anything for my Queen
6569 2018-08-22 13:45:18 y’all remember that fat ass oil spill
6570 2018-08-22 13:45:06 Not true. Coconut oil is good for you. For your skin and hair.
6571 2018-08-22 13:45:02 That’s ok. We will sell the water, electric. Oil, whisky, beer etc to ourselves.
6572 2018-08-22 13:44:55 You should try it some time.
6573 2018-08-22 13:44:50 That’s where the White Paper failed. I read it and as a lay person could see everything would be backed up by oil. It’s a volatile market as we’ve seen these last few years with huge knock on effect to small Scottish business . We would be skint
6574 2018-08-22 13:44:36 Yeah I agree with you. Practically the only oil & gas rich nation in the developed world to be a basket case. If you want to be serious for a moment it is a true indication of how the UKGovt currently runs it’s economy in Scotland. By attributing debt which it doesn’t have.
6575 2018-08-22 13:44:33 First check what the UK Treasury takes from Scotland annually, and then add on what they *make public* taken from North Sea Oil, and then see if your question is relevant.
6576 2018-08-22 13:44:33 Also as a small aside, citronella oil has been shown to be an effective repellant of Aedes Aegypti, the Dengue fever mosquito, which is absent in Britain and most of Europe. So doesn't really affect us, at all
6577 2018-08-22 13:44:33 Be careful when putting the new one in that you put it in a straight as you can, otherwise you could pinch the seal ring and then it will leak gearbox oil

6580 2018-08-22 13:44:10 Good! India seeks revision in natural gas price from 4 nations in pipeline projects Turkmenistan-Afghan-Pak-India (TAPI)

Prices need to be checked at regular interval

If the prices are brought to a stable level, the nation can escape from any further increase in the oil prices.
6581 2018-08-22 13:44:10 I always burn myself when I cook but I usually cook dishes with garlic in it and the aroma of garlic cooking in olive oil makes up for all the pain.

6582 2018-08-22 13:43:55 You don't think where giving weapons to Saudi and the president is kissing up to putin for nothing. If they actually support the yuan we are in for economic problems. Plus chine is the biggest oil (Saudi) importer ang LNG (Russia). How do you think it's gonna turn out.
6583 2018-08-22 13:43:53 For them, Macdonald oil = Amrit 
6584 2018-08-22 13:43:33 Oil Hedge funds are more "game on" and see $80 to $85 Oil and are thinking and buying CALL options out-of-the-money rather than General Investors with PUT options out-of-the-money. The more lopsided trade can move prices even if its the wrong idea.
6585 2018-08-22 13:43:15 Without getting our Land back, when get our Land back we will be self sufficient in 20 years. The living standards should be the equivalently a Gulf oil producing country.
6586 2018-08-22 13:43:09 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
6587 2018-08-22 13:43:09 Fascinating chart. Arab Oil Embargo, after-effects of closing the Gold Window, accelerating food/energy inflation, wage and price controls, and uneven economic performance coincided with all this, as well.
6588 2018-08-22 13:43:02 you didn't answer my question...who would you rather buy your oil from, russia or the saudis? there is no other option.
6589 2018-08-22 13:43:00 It's about time we sell the strategic oil reserve to Cuba. We won't even miss it!

6594 2018-08-22 13:42:06 Iran Sanctions:
European and Russian companies withdraw their large investment in Iran.
Due to US sanctions which started August 6, 2018.

6595 2018-08-22 13:42:00 And Chris Watts killed his wife and daughters, dumping the girls' bodies in an oil tank.  He was an American citizen.
6596 2018-08-22 13:42:00 Yeah, let's sort it, I've actually mellowed out; eating jerk rice with an ice-pick & sipping on crude oil with a plastic straw.

6598 2018-08-22 13:41:51 A president without certificate is corruption, 24billion usd oil contract without due process is corruption, nepotism is corruption,lies is corruption and Buhari has no atom of integrity so say something else.
6599 2018-08-22 13:41:38 It absolutely fascinates me that one of the smartest, most feared people on YouTube slurped up the goo from inside of an icepack, poured oil on himself and destroyed his hairline to prove a point, and spent a time fighting a real lawn gnome and making a diss track.
6600 2018-08-22 13:41:38 Cities need food,oil,mining products,timber. Rural areas can sustain themselves bc agri. Cities dependent on being supplied. A lot of food,mining,oil,timber exported- TX now exports more oil than imports.  Helped DT win that establishment ignored fly-over areas.

6614 2018-08-22 13:40:44 I@understand but my point was only that snp government has done nothing to assist oil and gas during the recent hard times.
6615 2018-08-22 13:40:40 @RedwoodMkts @lngmfi @SEALNGcoalition @ForwardLNG 50% CO2 drop reg by 2050 in shipping is in place. Fuel Oil=>LNG / 100%=>80% (20% drop).100's of ships use a nat gas generator to power electric motors. On land CCGT gain 50% (60% vs 40%). 80% * 2/3 = 53% (47% drop). Get to work!
6616 2018-08-22 13:40:34 They decided to invest the money to avoid oil price fluctuations from the past, and make a more stable income, this model is also being adopted by middle east oil governments.

6618 2018-08-22 13:40:23 The GERs system only indicates how Scotland is performing "within" the United Kingdom. It's a false representation of how Scotland could do out with the UK. £280m in tax revenue for oil....I don't feckin think so.....
6619 2018-08-22 13:40:22 I think it is more due to the current nature of the limited industries that could readily absorb new graduates.
People do not understand why our PM want 3rd national cars,the ripple effect could resuscitate the stagnant economy.
Oil&Gas could not be the nation paymaster forever.
6620 2018-08-22 13:40:21 Comparison can come from many angles. They can decide where they want to come from. The non-payt of subsidies by these guys was their way to many resources. The last guys could av done same. Rather than sell crude oil and buy back, just send it to refineries and pay for refining.

6629 2018-08-22 13:39:41 Government says it is exploring alternative ways of procuring oil to curb the rising fuel prices. South Africans are paying over 16 rand a litre inland for 95 octane petrol.#sabcnews

6631 2018-08-22 13:39:37 Off the top of my head... Branded olive oil and publications among others. Basically anything not part of the core tenets of the church that functions to explicitly create profit will be deemed "taxable".

6633 2018-08-22 13:39:16 As believers in age being the mileage, not the years. Enough miles to create a nice seat imprint, but lower than the first oil change and still have that new heavenly body smell.  ~1500 to 3000 bodymiles. Of course, it could be as DJ's we've heard too many car commercials.
6634 2018-08-22 13:39:11 Oil prices risen from $150 a barrel in summer 2008 and fell to $40 a barrel a few months later. That’s the cause of the crisis in Venezuela a predominantly petrostate economy
6635 2018-08-22 13:39:11 @jiffylube I just need to sue them to fix my car. I can't drive it, must go to dealership today. This is absolutely ridiculous. They should not touch if they didn't know what they were doing. Now the jiffy lube yesterday says the other jiffy placed wrong oil.

Oil with an extraction cost of $15-$20 off of the price of a barrel... multiplied by 2.5 Million barrels a day.
Still plenty of profit for someone ;)

6650 2018-08-22 13:37:48 I agree we should lessen our dependence on oil and gas (extractions)  - but why not go green? What is the point in continuing to invest in old and destructive technology? There is lots of work and money to be made there and the benefits are there as well.
6651 2018-08-22 13:37:48 No.  The £40bn is the tax that goes directly to the Treasury from oil exports by tanker directly from offshore production.  Does not show up as Scottish revenue, its labelled as unknown origin.  Can't think why they would want to reduce Scottish income by £40bn, can you?
6652 2018-08-22 13:37:47 That’s what happens when you trust your entire economy on the price of oil, and it crashes
6653 2018-08-22 13:37:46 So you believe the crap coming out of Usekess Nations too? Those wonderful people that prostitute themselves for the Arab oil dollar?

6656 2018-08-22 13:37:21 @jiffylube I been going to Jiffy Lube for years. I took my Benz and they put oil or something in wrong area. I been to 4 different Jiffy Lube to get fixed and they like call HR, it needs to go to dealership. I keep calling till free number no dang human. So

6661 2018-08-22 13:36:46 At $80 Brent Oil demand might drop off. 

Strengthening U.S. dollar raises the oil-importing countries’ import bills

Also makes dollar-priced oil more expensive to buy for holders of other currencies

6715 2018-08-22 13:31:04 Maybe Westminster actually likes Scotland and it’s people? Or maybe Scotland is just one of those things that successive Governments just keep subsidising- like the railways, oil industry, renewables, etc, etc. Pity the NATS don’t see it like that.

6999 2018-08-22 13:05:44 Hi Knowledge? I am interested in the Oil and Gas industry. I'm a fast learner too
7000 2018-08-22 13:05:43 Because a former boss from the oil patch has an opinion does not make it the sermon on the mount. You need to be working on re-establishing energy east not poisoning the environment (pun) for collaboration.
7001 2018-08-22 13:05:41 is biore cleansing oil really worth the hype? i used heimish balm tas feeling ko nagka-pimples ako 
7002 2018-08-22 13:05:39 we support them because they have oil and buy our weapons

7005 2018-08-22 13:05:24 Getting my oil changed and the guy next to me is enjoying his burrito more than any person should.
7006 2018-08-22 13:05:22 I put coconut oil in my lotion and apply it everyday and BABY let me tell you, my skin is super soft!!! I mean I always had soft skin but there is a NOTICEABLE difference
7007 2018-08-22 13:05:13 Coconut oil is the new bacon.

(If I must chance a slow death, then it will be death by bacon.)
7008 2018-08-22 13:05:11 Send him a pack of coconut oil made Banana chips , he will change his research then ;)

7010 2018-08-22 13:04:52 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You big fat idiot imbecile, and pawn of coal oil and gas. There is no such thing as clean coal. Maybe you need to suffer from the adverse health effects cause by pollution of burning coal to cure you of your ignorance.
7011 2018-08-22 13:04:51 Karaage, tonkatsu, breaded shrimp, and tempura are all fried in oil, right? But they're not aburaage ("oil-fried")!?
7012 2018-08-22 13:04:42 Is it your delusional?  Why can't you allow us continue being delusional...  Go and sell your mothers palm oil before she slaps you as usual, please don't forget to carry your rubber slippas when she throws it on you #bbnaija

7017 2018-08-22 13:03:35 @cltomlinson reading that the US is now exporting more oil than in imports - so why not stop importing and just buy our own oil?  What's the catch?

7019 2018-08-22 13:03:25 If we are right about oil going from $75 to $150 over the next 12 to 18 months, out-of-the-money oil options, further down the curve.

2019 Call Options on XOM and RDS.A are at low when 20% out of the money
7020 2018-08-22 13:03:18 Almost 10% population in India cook in coconut oil, consume coconut on daily basis. Either scary or most irresponsible headline of an article.
7021 2018-08-22 13:03:13 Quick to say something about sweet Mollie being murdered by an illegal, where is your sympathy for Sharon and her 2 babies? Oh, he is a white guy that murdered his wife and children by strangulation and stuck the babies in a oil bin. You DA! Both tragic!! Murder is murder #resign

7024 2018-08-22 13:02:47 Need to take my car to get the oil changed 
7025 2018-08-22 13:02:45 Please consider the savings on repairs as well . The maintenance for electric engine costs lesser than ICE .probably on inherent repairs ( engine sensors , oil change, parts) you save around 300 dollars/year.
7026 2018-08-22 13:02:26 Something about using a sugar scrub when shaving makes me feel like I’ve ascended to a higher plane. I am SMOOTH and SOFT through the power of a bunch of coffee grounds and sugar thrown together with some coconut oil.

7028 2018-08-22 13:02:16 You are a liar and a cheat.  Most of us know the truth. Anyone who says “believe me” 100 times a day is not trustworthy. That’s what liars and snake oil salesmen say.  Sad
7029 2018-08-22 13:02:15 Fucking white guy murdered his whole family and stuffed his own daughters body in oil tank.... And shit hit snooze after 2 days
7030 2018-08-22 13:02:11 dry skin? coconut oil want longer hair? coconut oil your heart is broken? rub some coconut oil on it b you gon be alright
7031 2018-08-22 13:02:11 For Scotland to be economically viable the deficit has to be less than 2% excluding oil.

The oil price is too volatile and production  rates too variable to base your economy on it (see Venezuela). 

Independence with a deficit of 8% would destroy Scottish public services.
7032 2018-08-22 13:01:58 Olive oil. S+P. Garlic. Lemons. Onions. Tomatoes. Capers. Pasta. Tinned tomato. Coriander. Chickpeas.
7033 2018-08-22 13:01:34 Fake news - no heaven, no God, just a bunch of snake oil salesmen getting rich on the backs of followers.  How much is Graham worth??

7035 2018-08-22 13:01:18 It’s olive oil
7036 2018-08-22 13:01:18 It all adds up to more (natural) gas being promoted by the so-called renewable wind and solar lobbies. Do they know they work for Big Oil, or are they still figuring it out? #usefulidiots
7037 2018-08-22 13:01:11 Change out transmission and differential oils. While not requiring frequent service, these fluids must be changed according to service intervals. Always use transmission fluid or gear oil of the recommended type and viscosity.

7039 2018-08-22 13:01:00 I'm not sure why US oil refineries would operate at half capacity during the 90s (or if they did), but it could be because the Clinton Administration was anti-oil? You do know who Clinton's VP was, and how he felt about oil? US oil production is up now 20 years later.
7040 2018-08-22 13:00:58 I like your system. But it’s restrictive. At least you protect property rights, and don’t have a minimum wage which allows people to negotiate their hourly wage. 

But it definitely relies on the oil to function as it does. People can only pay so much in taxes. That’s all.
7041 2018-08-22 13:00:54 I would pair the wine with steak and Italian  breads and oil dips
7042 2018-08-22 13:00:46 Also never any mention of the global manipulation, reduction of oil prices. Specifically targetting nations such as Venezuela to break their economies.

7045 2018-08-22 13:00:30 Dulu bodoh tak tau pasal skincare. Tak tau pun rupanya penting pakai moisturiser tu.

When your skin is dehydrating, it will produce more oil to keep ur skin moist.
But when oil is over produce, that's why ada lebihan sebum that causes acne when your pores were clogged.

7132 2018-08-22 12:51:47 I wonder why an "Energy tech/bizdev/strategy consultant" would be spouting the "party line" of large oil and gas companies. It's not like they get paid any significant money by large oil and gas companies?!
7133 2018-08-22 12:51:46 Many doctors say that olive oil must be avoided. 
If you have heart disease, I know they say to avoid it. 
I am not sure why they say it for other reasons. 
Can someone help us with the answer?
7134 2018-08-22 12:51:43 Coconut oil has 86% saturated fats which isa third more than butter ~ which contains 52%. So don't be deceived that Coconut oil is safe!

7137 2018-08-22 12:51:22 Who cares, child sets self on fire, girl found dead in cornfield, husband kills his family and stuffs them into oil barrels , manaford, polotics really ?? Is that a priority. Really?

7140 2018-08-22 12:51:15 my fav internet trope is when people refer to celebrities as some random ass product like canola oil or something rather than they’re name and idk why

7145 2018-08-22 12:50:29 The answer is oil interests, corrupting politics to stop incentives and delay development of renewable energy generation in the uk

7153 2018-08-22 12:49:38 You gave him 12 hour sex, having it in mind that you would break up with him after it.  What is your heart pumping? Maybe it's engine oil because you cannot tell me it's blood.

7165 2018-08-22 12:48:50 Ah. “Michels based her warning on the high proportion of saturated fat in coconut oil, which is known to raise levels of so-called LDL cholesterol, and so the risk of cardiovascular disease.” >> this bull again. Don’t believe her. DYOR.
7166 2018-08-22 12:48:49 There’s a whole Harvard professor saying that coconut oil is pure poison. That it’s filled with bad fat...

7168 2018-08-22 12:48:40 So Canadians are too stupid too build one which necessitates diverting our oil to our smarter competitor to the south. Makes good old Canadian logic!

7175 2018-08-22 12:47:39 Trump is a coarse, hatemongering charlatan. Bush was an oil rich frat boy who engaged in profiteering from war.  Both have a lifetime of being insulated from the consequences of their actions.

7177 2018-08-22 12:47:32 Expensive oil price also helps develop US shale so its win-win (if you aren’t bothered by a lot of death and destruction in dusty places that are far far away).

What #GERS shows us is the cost of the Union & its no cheap.

7186 2018-08-22 12:46:47 The price of oil is much greater today than in 2000s and more work gets done in the Sands of the world.
7187 2018-08-22 12:46:43 flatten it indirectly with well-paid religious lunatics (Libya, Syria), or use sanctions (Russia, Iran).
Oil is finite. USD can be created in infinite amounts at no cost, so expensive oil is not a problem for the US.
7188 2018-08-22 12:46:41 Did you know: Oil Storage costs in China are US$0.95 per barrel per month in the Shanghai International Energy Exchange compared with US$0.05 per barrel per month at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port? 

Reasons: limited storage capacity availability,cargo stored specific facility

7196 2018-08-22 12:46:08 .. called the Petrodollar system - which requires that the US do whatever it takes to prevent cheap oil from competing sources coming to market. 
if a country has large reserves of cheap oil either: flatten it directly (Iraq 2003) ...

7201 2018-08-22 12:45:44 There's Solar, Wind, and other ways to create energy, or hot water. We all know he's ignorant of these issues because he has never invested in them like he has in gas, oil and coal (his cronies are big into all of them). Unless it's good for Trump & Co he cares not 1 wit.

7211 2018-08-22 12:44:56 A high oil price supports the international value of US dollars and funds your huge welfare/warfare state.

7222 2018-08-22 12:43:55 Well, what happens? It will have an influence. However 11 years in a row the oil production has decreased. We build wind turbines combined with solar cell production. The need for oil decreases drastically. But naturally the sales will lower

7228 2018-08-22 12:43:02 'Purport' is your key word. 

I would say some bureaucrats with excellent mental clarity have ensured that no ME oil aside from Saudi oil has reached the market in large volumes in recent years. 

The US creates chaos across Eurasia to ensure oil is sold for USD and is expensive.

7263 2018-08-22 12:39:57 Yip totally mad, use oil/gas to make fertilizer while you could just spread natural stuff instead, they then say too much P or K yet it is still needed as well and being topped up with bag fertilizer
7264 2018-08-22 12:39:56 An English man,
appointed to the Scottish Parliament.

Tells us what's good for us is Westminster, which has ROBBED every Scot of 200,000 a total of One Trillion from oil funds.

Says we're "BETTER" Together, even an Abusive husband says thanks after taking from his wife's purse
7265 2018-08-22 12:39:54 Well someone needs to make that argument cogently. An expert. The Sco Gov. etc. Show how an independent Scotland would make more out of the oil deposits. I have not seen such a thing.
7266 2018-08-22 12:39:45 You have no climate change plan so stop misleading. Move away from big oil donors. Carbon Tax is meant to be revenue neutral. If you live in a province that is not giving back the rebates elect someone who will and invest in green tech like wind or solar. Bringing in new jobs.
7267 2018-08-22 12:39:44 @SenWarren #trump should know a man was convicted for killing his wife & 2 toddlers; buried 2 girls in a drum filled with oil & buried his wife in a narrow grave. What’s the ratio of American murderers to Americans compared to immigrant murderers to Americans? They’re all beasts!

Might be good on crackers with some tomatoes on top with oil over
7273 2018-08-22 12:39:06 Yes,frequent use of corn oil in day to day use is not recomended by researchers.
7274 2018-08-22 12:39:02 Add good quality anchovies in oil, and tuna in olive oil to that list. Also, rices. Basmati, Calasparra, & Vialone nano for risotto. Now make a list of where to stock up from, wholesale

7276 2018-08-22 12:38:57 I think it's perfectly clear for those who want to see it, that individuals like Franklin and con artist, snake oil salesman the very essence of what Jesus warned about, God warned about and Franklin and his followers are literally worshipping at the feet of their new Golden Calf
7277 2018-08-22 12:38:56 GERS day should be a day when the Nats express gratitude to the No voters for saving them from poverty.
Instead, all we hear is ‘secret oil fields’ and ‘whisky export tax’. #GERS
7278 2018-08-22 12:38:52 The problem with that claim(aside from leaping past details and into slander) is that social democracy has a high price tag and when the money isn't there anymore it becomes one of those third world regimes. Most of the nations you'd cite are propped up by oil like Venezuela was.

7282 2018-08-22 12:38:32 Jesus I never actually conscidered the relationship between oil and air I'll give it a read he seems like a good writer after quick glance.

7284 2018-08-22 12:38:29 What l call a last minute prayer is the one made by one just because he or she is in need of God's favor. Remember the parable of the 5 wise maids with their oil and their opposite 5? It's not about prayer but your relationship with God. Haikoreri pamaketi
7285 2018-08-22 12:38:28 And buy the way, oil is not pure. There are many different grades which are traded over the counter and priced off different formulas depending on quality,  geographical logistics, shipping terms and other. If trader settles in CNY it is just another layer of risk to manage

It doesn't make a fucking bit of #cents

7300 2018-08-22 12:36:37 The way I take magnesium is to buy a 25kg sack of magnesium chloride from farmers suppliers. And add it to my bath or footbaths.. You can also make magnesium oil with 50% dilution in water and just apply to skin.
7301 2018-08-22 12:36:30 Well look what the ANC and EFF spends at restaurants on booze so I'm not surprised. What's next? Golden taps like the Arab oil barons?
7302 2018-08-22 12:36:24 Especially if na the oil type of injection and not water based.
7303 2018-08-22 12:36:23 If for a moment we accept that the tax situation is accurately depicted then that just means we would be running a deficit - like the vast majority of countries including UK. Interestingly Norway ran a 4.4% surplus in 2017. Even when oil prices remained depressed.

7306 2018-08-22 12:35:54 It goes up and down all the time. A very short sighted argument for Independence which will continue long after the oil has gone. Oil revenues can fall just as quickly as we saw in the last few years.
7307 2018-08-22 12:35:48 And oil shush? What kind of oil imo
7308 2018-08-22 12:35:35 So did the scum bag that killed his wife and two kids and dumped then in a oil tank.. There are plenty of deplorable pale white men out here to be concentrating on . But that wall is more important . Ya know the one that Mexico is paying 4?

7341 2018-08-22 12:31:30 My personal opinion is that more plastic should be replaced with paper products. Plastic comes from oil which is not renewable. Paper comes from trees which us is renewable. So IMHO oil should be used for products that r recycled. Most straws & bags r not.

7361 2018-08-22 12:29:14 If CNY oil price is off $ parity eventually such difference allows arb opp to traders either through oil itself or through FX. If China tries to settle more physical oil in CNY that will create more supply in CNY, leading to $CNY going up. I don't know if they need it

7378 2018-08-22 12:27:36 We don't need Saudi oil. We have plenty. The Saudis buy lots of LAVs from us and lots of barley, which they need. The prancing prince thought we were an easy target. We're not. There will be no apology and our economy will remain strong because we have more than oil.

7392 2018-08-22 12:26:00 It sounds counter-intuitive, but by keeping your skin clean less oily you might actually be overstimulating your face's oil and sebum production, which can lead to breakouts. This was me and I switched to washing my face lightly with basic soap 1x per day in the morning.

7400 2018-08-22 12:24:53 Unacceptable, archaic, and barbaric. Why this is allowed: Oil, money and misogyny. The international community needs step in.
7401 2018-08-22 12:24:42 Which is why a snake oil salesmen like you need to be voted out of office! #votecorey #CTPolitics

7405 2018-08-22 12:24:32 My ex was very emotionally abusive to the extent I ended up in hospital 5 times coz of depression. In 2016 his mom moved in and witness all our fights and his shit ways. Her advice "just bath n out in sweet smelling lotion oil n sexy lingerie n please him"
7406 2018-08-22 12:24:19 Let me know if that works. Tried melatonin, valarian root, lavender oil. Nothing helps anymore.

7408 2018-08-22 12:24:12 I gave my cat enough CBD oil (specified for pets) to knock out a Rottweiler for our car trip and zero effect, leading me to the conclusion that my cat does not have car anxiety, she is just obnoxious

7410 2018-08-22 12:23:56 Our fed & prov gov does business with them.  And our hospitals & universities.  Not me.  We have Canadian oil & gas and expensive Trudeau pipelines.
7411 2018-08-22 12:23:48 Yes.. coconut oil is among best oils for internal as well as external use along with our own cold pressed oils groundnut and mustard and sesame oils depending on area we live in.. all other oils are useless propoganda only. they in same way demonized our good old ghee too..
7412 2018-08-22 12:23:16 The impetus on oil producing companies to be proactive and make savings through reducing wages or their overheads when the price of oil drops...

...has nothing to do with the price of oil dropping?

Right.

7414 2018-08-22 12:23:06 Beyond the fact that you can expect a few irresponsible hacks in any profession, in Journalism it is getting increasingly difficult to tell apart professionals from the equivalent of snake oil salesmen.
Working for a media company is not enough evidence of being a 'Truth Cadet'.
7415 2018-08-22 12:22:52 Exactly Max. interconnection is obvious to us former reform technos working since 2006 in Gov. 2 principles. 1, total dependence of economy on Gov expenditure of oil revenues + 2, lack of financial controls rationalising expenditure producing runaway spending and looting behavior

7417 2018-08-22 12:22:21 I live in Dubai mate, even over here they’ve moved away from oil. It’s a horrendous idea to build an economy on
7418 2018-08-22 12:22:11 I would prefer we don’t buy Saudi oil. It’s a corrupt country that has exported terrorism all over the world. Last week a Saudi missile killed over 40 children in Yemen. Why do you want to do business with them?

7421 2018-08-22 12:21:54 How does it pay off? By propping up an industry that can't support itself? We subsidize more and collect less royalties from oil and gas than many other countries. Then are left with the bill to clean up the mess when these companies go belly up. Enough.
7422 2018-08-22 12:21:47 And if we add oil whisky tourism fish food shipbuilding etch how much are we really losing out on   we can all make stats look bad you've been getting away with it for decades

7444 2018-08-22 12:19:10 The fund is growing every year because the Norwegian government is investing the oil revenues, which it is at peak levels: 70% of oil income goes to stocks. The higher oil price the more the fund will invest. R > G is not applicable here.

7457 2018-08-22 12:17:34 Islam, like Christianity is a choice. Both have/had theological schisms that inflame passions and cause regional conflicts. America must withdraw from any participation in religious differences. American interferrence for oil, like Soviet has proven counterproductive in the ME.
7458 2018-08-22 12:17:12 You need to stop spreading lies RUTH,is England that benefits from the Union with Scotland as they soon will find out once Scotland gets independent and the oil and gas money stops going south of the border.

7504 2018-08-22 12:11:04 Future demand for bitumen is suspect. Proposed new pipelines in Canada are meant for export markets not domestic consumption.  Canada need more refineries to use its own product,  as part of a longer term reduction plan and transition away from oil and gas.

7517 2018-08-22 12:09:52 Everyone is focused on personal politics, rather than simple rules to rationalise oil expenditure.
7518 2018-08-22 12:09:44 Are you serious right now? Nice job throwing out the typical MAGA talking points, may I suggest that you turn off Fox News? I think it is you who needs to focus on what this snake oil salesmen is truly doing.

7543 2018-08-22 12:05:24 You need to think about human greed and what people think they should earn. If you were working on an oil refinery in the middle of the ocean would you want to make the same as the guy sweeping up hair at a salon?

7546 2018-08-22 12:04:51 I’ve been washing my face with dettol pomegranate soap, rosewater as toner, @CoriumSkincare tamanu oil killed my spots, their rose hip oil lightened  my dark marks. I do a bentonite clay + acv + water mask twice a week.
7547 2018-08-22 12:04:31 So what happens when you run out of oil? Or some crazy Green Party wins and decides to stop producing oil because it’s affecting the Earth? 

Have kids my friend. And tell your friends. Otherwise, your system will not last.
7548 2018-08-22 12:04:26 Olive oil, tinned tomatoes, tomato paste, chickpeas, tuna, liquid chicken stock, onions, garlic, the trinity of spices (salt, pepper, paprika), peanuts, macadamia nuts
7549 2018-08-22 12:04:26 Another example, landlords that keep housing off market, to raise rents. Another, US oil refineries operating at half capacity in the late 90s. Another example, limiting food production to protect values(also dealt with with price floors). What about the overproduction paradox?

7556 2018-08-22 12:02:43 I've got dirt all over, so much that its almost an aesthetic, because nearly everything I touch in this place is covered in oil and one of the men came over earlier and was all "oh it's very u ladylike for you to be covered in oil isn't it? it's fine for us men, but you"

7565 2018-08-22 12:00:52 Your system needs kids to pay for you in your old age when you don’t work, and when the oil runs out that pays for all of your benefits. 

You’re better than Venezuela. That’s for sure. But, like Venezuela, your system will collapse with mass migration. So watch the gates.
7566 2018-08-22 12:00:43 Dems seeking truth? LOL! They wouldn’t recognize truth if it hit them. Didn’t they vote for the snake-oil-salesman twice & still worship that empty suit? And then voted for HRC who’s been lying for her entire “career” ? Nuff said.

7592 2018-08-22 11:57:58 My service interval is 27000 or one year. I grew up in a country where we service 5000km or 3 months so oil change is important to me. So no i would service at the recommended time. Not nice to be stuck in the middle of nowhere at night.

7681 2018-08-22 11:45:58 #VenezuelaOilCrisis: This country still have the largest oil reserves in the world. Even larger that Saudi Arabia.

So what has caused this economic demise?

I think a lack of Financial Management, Economic Forward Planning, and Central Planning where it should never be done.

7683 2018-08-22 11:45:41 *As a side benefit, cheap olive oil is the fella here, less likely to burn and the pepperiness of virgin oil is too much for the courgettes. LOTS of it though - 10 plugs at least "If the oil doesn't drip down your chin mum it's not courgette pasta"

7692 2018-08-22 11:44:14 When the apocalypse comes and shipments of oil and gas literally dry up their powered farm equipment will not last long. They will need a lot of human labour to keep the farm going.
7693 2018-08-22 11:44:01 1. We no longer have dependence on other countries for oil .    2. Climate change does not exist.    3. Solar panel are not feasible at this time...perhaps in 30-40 years solar panels will be correct!     MSo you probably need a different platform otherwise you are doomed!

7701 2018-08-22 11:43:09 that's about the same THC purity which the cannabis oil had which was commonly smoked back in the 70s and 80s
7702 2018-08-22 11:43:02 Yes. I do have a question. The gas prices do not reflect our energy independence or the cost per barrel of oil.  How can he correct this?
7703 2018-08-22 11:42:59 Right, stop giving it to military contracting companies who use it for illegal and unjust wars. Stop using it to defend oil and opium around the globe, and give it only to the aging, the disabled, and orphans and widows, as it is intended
7704 2018-08-22 11:42:45 It’ll be awesome when oil and stuff splatters in there

7719 2018-08-22 11:40:51 Yes, this tax is 1hell of a slippery slope. It's misleading. It's not a one-hit. Gas is Oil which makes up at least 75% of your standard of living. Most people have no idea how much oil is your life. EVERY ONE of these aspects will increase in price. It's a bankrupting tactic.

7730 2018-08-22 11:39:07 Venezuela's problems are not at all because of Western (imperialists) powers. Maduro, the current president, deserves to be entirely blamed. He made the economy entirely dependent on oil and government the sole supplier of everything.

7759 2018-08-22 11:35:33 Why go for high range items. Even your edible oil mrp is marked big. There are at least 4 chains. Super distributer, distributer, whole sale, local retailer. Sometimes even 1. Each with  min 15% margin in many case. Its for margin manipulation that huge mrp.

7767 2018-08-22 11:34:53 Filters clog up, oil loses viscosity and collects particles increasing wear and tear, fuel becomes dirty and clogs up injectors.  Small turbo filters that clog up can break a turbo - ask Alfa owners.  Keep going with your experiment, you'll see

Just a hint before you make a fool of yourselves - that's Scotland making MORE than the UK total...
7808 2018-08-22 11:27:09 no mention of who funded the research... until they discuss how dangerous sugar is, won't believe any recommendation.

7816 2018-08-22 11:25:29 Love the idea of spray olive oil because brushing the pastry sheets is my least favourite part of the process. I always put a good squeeze of lemon juice when I mix through an egg, and I love the slight sharpness with the salty feta.

7822 2018-08-22 11:24:43 If this is not accompanied by a journal report, this is just fear-mongering. Sorry bro, I am now eating Suman sa Biko in pure oily coconut oil! Haha
7823 2018-08-22 11:24:33 NNPC claims it lost N111.42 billion worth of crude oil and products in its custody between 2015 - 2017. This is separate from the N427 billion it claimed as financial losses incurred at its corporate headquarters alone. 3yrs rule, Buhari & APC Govt is now the pillar of corruption

7832 2018-08-22 11:22:49 In a pure commodity like oil, the marginal barrel prices the whole.  All it takes is marginal oil barrels being priced a certain way in CNY to begin to affect either oil flows &/or FX x-rates in a big way.

7835 2018-08-22 11:22:23 Is Scotland's oil included in our export figures? Asking for a friend...
7836 2018-08-22 11:22:15 Whisky and oil Scott. That’s the standard response from Nationalists.
7837 2018-08-22 11:22:14 Omg....... there’s a new oil patch in Utah. The other stuff has become the norm now so not that big of a deal.
7838 2018-08-22 11:21:49 The SEC is setting a dangerous precedent by sending people charged with a few $10k's of insider trades to jail, but basically ignoring multi-billion $$ frauds.  The revelation of the 4.8k cars needing rework confirms the snake oil, yet the salesman is being encouraged.

7844 2018-08-22 11:21:39 Yes, such as labour costs ( nothing to do with the price of oil at market) exploration/extraction costs (nothing to do with the price of oil at market) 

The price dropped due to over production from the Saudis as they tried to prevent the USA moving into fracking. It failed.
7845 2018-08-22 11:21:32 A true entrepreneur like most of the big time Flerfers. Like religion or snake oil sellers they do it for the money not believing a word of what they say. Perhaps it's time to encourage the dummies gullible enough to part with cash in a sort or natural selection experiment.
7846 2018-08-22 11:21:30 The only reason that Democratic Socialists praise Denmark’s system is because every other time socialism is tried it has failed. So if you want Socialism to work you’re gonna want a massive supply of oil under the sea to fund it.

Though I never serviced you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
Despite your lack of oil
The pistons shot out of the gaskets
And they seized up your whole drivetrain
They sent you to the header mill
And they chalked you up to owner blame
7861 2018-08-22 11:20:12 Kola Aluko didn't launder any money for Gej, he's accused of having crude oil dealings with Dieziani but no one has proven that the FG didn't get it's due share from any sales he conducted. Cases against PEJ will keep getting thrown out by competent courts
7862 2018-08-22 11:20:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

7864 2018-08-22 11:19:54 Sandy, Sandy, Sandy...Norway’s oil is state owned, Scotland’s is in private hands. All Scot Gov gets is the tax. Do keep up.
7865 2018-08-22 11:19:51 Honduras has nothing to do with Venezuela's expropriation of land, agriculture, livestock, steel (Sidor), cement, oil(PDVSA), juice and flushed all manner of production while doubling workers & payroll where instead of doing their job in manufacturing, they are paid activists.
7866 2018-08-22 11:19:41 .@business

Norway is moving closer to deciding whether its $1 trillion wealth fund will dump all its oil and gas stocks...
7867 2018-08-22 11:19:27 There's no evidence the govt is being bankrupted, given increasing tax revenues.

Getting the economy to recover from oil price shocks & sabotage on an empty treasury without inflicting more pain on the masses clearly necessitated a more socialist than capitalist policy stance.
7868 2018-08-22 11:19:22 oh!イル
7869 2018-08-22 11:18:56 Of course if Scotland had been independent all along it would have a trillion pound oil fund like Norway. Makes £13 billion look like a drop in the ocean
7870 2018-08-22 11:18:46 .@business 
By the end of the second quarter, the Norwegian wealth fund held 6.2 percent of its equity portfolio in oil and gas companies, valued at $41 billion. The oil and gas sector was the best performing in the quarter, returning 13 percent.

7889 2018-08-22 11:15:18 well let's start with the word revenue.  The £15bn black hole refers to the difference between actual spending by Sco Gov/Uk on Sco and actual tax revenue generated in Sco.  From GERS.  What does £39.8 billion oil revenue actually mean - cause it clearly isn't tax revenue?

7895 2018-08-22 11:14:45 The symbol of anointing in the Bible is oil. How is oil created? By olives being crushed.

You're in a season of crushing in your life, asking, "God, what are you doing!?" He's creating anointing.

7939 2018-08-22 11:08:30 The US is interfering in Venezuela, but the responsibility for the economy is the government's. They're the ones who overdrew for short term investment and failed to invest in their state oil company, all while expropriating and fixing prices.

7944 2018-08-22 11:07:15 #WednesdayWisdom In high school one of my science teachers who had been liberal taught me a great lesson.  Summed up. A student was asking about why America was so bad, talking about oil. He said, “I thought that, and moved to another country. I moved back for freedom.”

The world’s biggest wealth fund shocked global markets last year by proposing to cut oil and gas stocks from its benchmark equity index.

7953 2018-08-22 11:06:25 Sole debt and trust path is what we have right now. Venezuela produces oil that it cannot effectively sell, because USA sanction power killed the trust. Thus it's currency is devalued to hell.

7955 2018-08-22 11:05:50 Um no!  Oil!  May have to get some lard and try again.  
7956 2018-08-22 11:05:40 We have been using coconut oil ever since and always had healthy feel. Non sense finding.

7958 2018-08-22 11:05:28 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
7959 2018-08-22 11:04:54 i agree the agendas in war are always about money we are fighting one right now people that want the oil in these countries my grandson was at the Khyber pass for 2 tours do you know about that pass God bless you my Sergeant Antoni will i forget never
7960 2018-08-22 11:04:52 I sell  organic 3in1oil oil for skin/hair care and organic black soap very affordable.pls RT nd patronise thanks
7961 2018-08-22 11:04:49 .ตอนนี้คุณคิดว่าคุณมีความสุขไหม.?
7962 2018-08-22 11:04:39 Stop all these forming “I work in oil industry” “..and you people..”. 
The oil industry is not full deregulated does not mean it’s not deregulated.
Why is Dangote building a refinery? When licenses were issued for refineries by OBJ, that’s part of deregulation.
7963 2018-08-22 11:04:22 Ah just cannae wait tae see what the global oil guru and owned&bought Tory establishmentarian SIR Ian Wood has tae say about this.
From my perspective ah’m more interested on when we’re gonna spend the revenue from increased growth on homelessness and foodbanks?
7964 2018-08-22 11:04:15 It's not just fish... miso soup tastes like used engine oil and I can't stomach it. Tofu seems to have a terrible texture..
7965 2018-08-22 11:03:59 yes  so handsome ..haha
7966 2018-08-22 11:03:51 Absolutely! If you buy the pure oil, you can fulfill it with water to make it easier to spray, and more cost effective. 
7967 2018-08-22 11:03:42 Think many people did after the debacle of  the 70s, oil crisis etc. We can only now work for a potential government that we as members of the party have some influence over. As the membership grows so does its voice. Between us we can have a #LabourParty #ForTheManyNotTheFew

Don’t forget there are people that rely on this industry. How about going after oil companies that keep the auto industry hoodwinked. More electric cars! Oh forget all the taxes our country has on a gallon of gas!
7970 2018-08-22 11:03:02 You're making a mistake. In fact if you did oil changes every 10,000 Km's your motor and gear box will last longer.

7974 2018-08-22 11:02:21 I’m shocked by the idea that blue collar workers might believe Conservative snake oil salesmen peddling lies about how much better off they’d be if there only wasn’t too much immigration and if taxes were lowered for “job creators”. Shocked.

7979 2018-08-22 11:01:52 Hi Kate the #UKOG  Flare stack is an enclosed stack  like they have at council incinerators. The stack you are looking at is just a shrouded flare stack. Ie you can't see the flame. BB and #Horsehill are the first if it's kind in the UKOG on a Oil site. Environment friendly :)
7980 2018-08-22 11:01:45 More than that. Within the Roman empire, similar products like wine and olive oil were traded between regions. So Italy, although it produced wine & oo, still imported wine & oo from Spain.
7981 2018-08-22 11:01:37 The government of Guinea has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Derrick Rose in a grenfell cloth wig.

7991 2018-08-22 11:00:44 He's obviously too young to understand simple arithmetic. Gej made the market favorable? 
How much was the price of the oil before he left? Dumb.
7992 2018-08-22 11:00:33 I find oil easier because it dries slower so it gives you more time to blend your colors or more leeway if you change your mind.
7993 2018-08-22 10:59:45 How much money is north sea oil taking in
7994 2018-08-22 10:59:32 Liberals are still mourning. Hillary went back to counting foundation funds. Get Trump out of the way and she can go back getting hand outs from oil rich country’s
7995 2018-08-22 10:59:21 There was virtually no oil tax take over the last several years ( in millions rather than the billions quoted in the fantasy separation white paper)
7996 2018-08-22 10:59:10 Excuses. Manafort was a baby oil with Reagan. Long before becoming a corrupt Russian. The two stories of paid off women came inside 60 days of an eletion after grab em by the pussy was heard. What's next? It has no effect?

7998 2018-08-22 10:59:07 I think sometimes people are scared that they have to go all in straigh away but even just a little change will make a difference. My kids were really sad when I took away Nutella because of the palm oil, but when I showed them the impact they were happy to swap for the meridian
7999 2018-08-22 10:59:07 DRINKABLE OIL!!!!

8002 2018-08-22 10:59:00 Hate to break it to u, but I will anyways- ur #Republican idols began a very long, close relationship with the Middle East, oil tycoons, like #BinLaden, YEARS ago. All the way back to the #IranContraDeal. U can find this info in many, many books. Well documented. #TryAgain

8005 2018-08-22 10:58:30 Can the left & right talk about how  the  left media & all other media helped out an oil company, the  cia and  the  fbi at  Standing Rock? Michael  A Wood  jr did nefarious actions at Standing  Rock. it's weird how TYT wasnt  able touch the  Kathleen Bennett story.

8008 2018-08-22 10:58:12 Scotland’s oil revenue jumps by £1 BILLION .   You can rest assured that they’ll be people in Scotland, perfectly happy to receive 10% of the money, rather than putting the other 90% in the bank for their kids future. Norway has over a TRILLION in the bank.
8009 2018-08-22 10:58:07 I second coconut oil. My wife uses it as a make up remover.

8013 2018-08-22 10:56:36 Venezuela is where it is not because of socialism, but because of USA sanctions, USA backing up the opposition to overthrow Maduro and smuggling of money outside of Venezuela, and because Venezuela's economy relied too much on oil
8014 2018-08-22 10:56:24 I see nothing of value. Seems like a short term fancy of a certain group. Are they after a place on the board, or just cheap placing shares?
8015 2018-08-22 10:56:16 Thank you, negative events all around the world, stems from influence by jew elites, notice how in a lot of right wing news sources owned by zionists, they scapegoat Muslims for problems created by Jewish influence in the corrupt American gov like wars for oil and ISIS.

8019 2018-08-22 10:55:45 This amount is excluded from the monies Dieziani Madueke was paying into her Private account I think from the National oil sales

8022 2018-08-22 10:55:17 The case for independence in 2014 was built on oil, why do you think it failed?
8023 2018-08-22 10:55:04 Under GERS does Scotland get allocated 100% of its take in Oil,Whisky,Fishing,Agriculture etc etc or just 8% share as a population ratio.
8024 2018-08-22 10:54:50 @SZmembers any current updates on crude oil charts? Thx in ADV
8025 2018-08-22 10:54:44 Service is changing oil. Remove worn plugs, oil filters, air filters and in some instances change the timing chains and other minor changes...
8026 2018-08-22 10:54:19 M-346 Master US$20m each. And that’s before you add  AirCon, SatNav and 19in rims. One Pilatus PC9 off the shelf around US$6.5m and I’d reckon it has a cheaper oil change. But yeah, Croke Park flyovers would be far cooler ok.

8037 2018-08-22 10:52:21 Who's relying on oil? You live in a UK that is far more reliant on financial services, & is currently leaving the EU which will destroy said financial services. And yet, your British nationalism won't allow you to see the logical way out. Cult like behaviour.
8038 2018-08-22 10:51:41 So I decided to some little experiment. The car manufacturer says the service interval is 15,000km. I drove the car for a while 40,000km without taking the car in. Only topped up oil. The are ran beautifully for all the 40,000km. I can only conclude that we’re being screwed.

8044 2018-08-22 10:50:44 Is an idea i read long ago that WW1 Had 2 start once gemans began attacking mid eastern oil domination?
8045 2018-08-22 10:50:15 What about that white man who murdered his two daughters and his wife who was 15- months pregnant w/ their third child. Stuffed his daughters in oil drums to mask the smell of their rotting bodies. He wasn’t illegal but an American citizen. What say you about that?
8046 2018-08-22 10:50:13 You’ve also got lots of civil servants attributed to Scotland but working,living and contributing to the economy in other parts of the UK. Not to mention the offshore oil workers taxed at their home addresses rather than where they work.
8047 2018-08-22 10:50:11 As long as the oil keeps flowing and they keep making deals for billions of dollars with western governments and corporations, these governments will never say a word. Look at the situation in Yemen.
8048 2018-08-22 10:50:04 Rockefeller: "The ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee and I will pay more for that ability than for any other under the sun."

8051 2018-08-22 10:49:23 The racism in response to this post is disheartening. You don’t see these kind of comments on tweets about the guy who killed his pregnant wife and two young daughters and then subsequently stuffed them in a tank full of crude oil.

I wonder what the difference is

8053 2018-08-22 10:48:57 Shame about all hidden oil discoveries which don’t count
8054 2018-08-22 10:48:56 You have no idea about my level of wit.  Oil revenue is largely designated 'ex-regio' in government accounts and not allocated to Scotland as it should be.  GERS is the very definition of 'making something up' and only a guy with a Union flag on their profile would fall for it.
8055 2018-08-22 10:48:55 face oil clogged my pores tf. or i can choke the oil straight down to your stomach

8058 2018-08-22 10:48:16 It’s basically that, but the herb combo is really good. Butterflied leg of lamb, 2 tblsp dried oregano, then a bunch (an enormous amount) of fresh parsley, basil, mint, olive oil juice of lemon two crushed garlic. Let it marinate for a day or two.
8059 2018-08-22 10:48:16 Scottish oil revenue was £200 Million last year. The white paper for Independence said it would be £8.5 Billion a year. What are you talking about?

8062 2018-08-22 10:47:31 The reason tax per head in Scotland is lower - UK Govt are not taxing the oil companies - the only oil producing nation not to tax oil production

8064 2018-08-22 10:47:27 Chef McElroy cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with gravy.
8065 2018-08-22 10:47:02 Is it true that our ozone’s severe degradation is   flatulence thus the Gulf States fault not their oil exports

8069 2018-08-22 10:46:28 Just guessing: try patchouli oil in an aromatizing diffuser thingy?
8070 2018-08-22 10:46:26 This is why I can't wait for the independence of Scotland so little England doesnt have to pay back the money that they steal from our oil and gas.
Hope you got my sarcasm.
8071 2018-08-22 10:46:05 Apparently if your sink gets blocked with oil and other shit it’s called a Fatburg so I’m thinking of starting a burger truck and naming it that

8077 2018-08-22 10:45:15 I looked everywhere in them but could not find any oil!


8078 2018-08-22 10:45:10 It was tongue in cheek, Scotland would also be heading for hyper-inflation under the idiots that you support. It is what happens when your economy relies on a commodity like oil and the people in power have no clue on running a country.

8080 2018-08-22 10:44:55 Most jobs Obama created were government, taxpayer-funded jobs. The private sector lost jobs except for the oil industry. Without Texas, he would have lost a net of 2.5 million jobs...

8084 2018-08-22 10:44:05 His version falls down at the "So I threw my apparently beloved children in an oil well" part.

This story guts me, especially as he probably did this for money. I have two daughters and I would rather run across the M6 in rush hour then ever see either of them dead.
8085 2018-08-22 10:43:42 This. Why would anyone want to stay chained to the oil companies business model?

8098 2018-08-22 10:40:25 Software is not easy and that is why the government of today would NEVER invest in training people on it. Software money is the complete opposite of oil money..software money involves long term thinking, intellectual focus and self drive with initial low return.

8112 2018-08-22 10:38:21 Nope. Germany had too little material and oil to build, maintain, replace and fuel them. Probably would have had a ‘Hotel Graf Zeppelin’ (a la Yamato) at best.
8113 2018-08-22 10:38:19 Norway raised £21bn from similar volume of oil over same period. WM mismanagement abounds.

8130 2018-08-22 10:35:50 They’ve lowered the costs through wage cuts and efficiencies. The drop in the oil price doesn’t effect production costs. 

And you note exploration investment has dropped too. That means less oil extraction in the future.
8131 2018-08-22 10:35:29 Yes I do. Can you just get the reeds and choose a quality essential oil? (Now of course I'm wondering if rushes or reeds from round about will work!)
8132 2018-08-22 10:35:06 And mine and I’d rather boil my head in a vat of oil than vote Tory and I will never not vote
8133 2018-08-22 10:34:53 The west cares more for oil than for human rights. We all know this. Why are people there pretending like they care.

8138 2018-08-22 10:34:13 We recently stopped using sunflower oil and started cold-pressed groundnut oil. We can reheat and use this oil unlike refined oil.

8141 2018-08-22 10:33:52 @ImranKhanPTI Energy Is the largest import of Pakistan.  Ethanol can meet this need.  Sugar is harmful for humans and can be used for large scale ethanol production for use instead of expensive oil imports. corn to ethanol. sugar cane to ethanol.

8148 2018-08-22 10:32:44 Not energy specialist but imagine each country with oil reserves took its own path on tax treatment - eg what are allowable expenses/write-offs and time scales, ring fencing, royalties v profits taxation, when payment is made, Maybe UK is more complicated, so harder to change?

8157 2018-08-22 10:31:32 This was 5 years ago, when Chavez died. He'd nationalised the nations oil and shared the wealth! Maduro has been sanctioned ever since because he wont allow them to control it either!
8158 2018-08-22 10:31:28 There were lies, certainly. What was it the SNP said about our automatic EU membership and great oil income post-indy?
All shown to be untrue. We’d be bankrupt and isolated from both UK and EU if more people had fallen for it. Narrow escape.
8159 2018-08-22 10:31:17 We should aspire to be like Venezuela, oil rich and just need a whisky business.
8160 2018-08-22 10:30:56 I think this refers to the Snake Oil Mideast Peace Plan.

8181 2018-08-22 10:28:47 The answer is simple,  the oil and gas sector is yet to be deregulated and your people are those that cry to high heaven when it could have been deregulated long ago to make the refinery business viable due to your hypocrisy. It's all politics.

8222 2018-08-22 10:22:16 It's not hypocrisy when you're blatant about it. It's selling. Snake oil, data, all the same, as long as the cash (oops, cashless) register keeps ringing.

8227 2018-08-22 10:21:44 Hi @rosscolquhoun 
Would you know the total amount of oil tax revenue taken by Westminster since the discovery in the late 60s. 
A big question I know, but I bet the answer would be phenomenal.
8228 2018-08-22 10:21:25 get some patchouli essential oil?  You can get ultrasonic diffusers that don't burn the oil.
8229 2018-08-22 10:21:20 Well, it's done rather well for Norway which stayed at the forefront of oil tech, via Statoil and renewable energy, so I would say yes. 
Read 'Blossom' by @LesleyRiddoch for a collection of great thinking on this.

8238 2018-08-22 10:19:41 Blair & Cameron gave us style over substance from slick snake oil salesmen & look where that got us. To me substance is more important than style. After the smoke clears it's the policies that matter to people's lives not how well you can spin a bad news story or polish a turd.
8239 2018-08-22 10:19:36 Think you under estimate the Scottish people yes they are aware of our wealth but unfortunately when unnamed faceless corporate company's that  run the world are removed that oil will never be used to help all people of Scotland.

8248 2018-08-22 10:19:11 Remove oil and replace with agriculture. You spend wisely when you work hard to get the cash.
8249 2018-08-22 10:19:08 The cost of production for oil companies has decreased as a byproduct of the downturn in oil price, it costs less now!

If the taxes were not reduced and the oil price rises (a isolated aspect irrelevant of the tax rate) the tax receipts would be higher in that hypothetical.
8250 2018-08-22 10:18:59 Go figure the more gas a car uses the early the oil is gone. 
The earlier the world has to look for alternative technology. 
Since #trump is the best with alternative facts I guess this is the best way to go.

8318 2018-08-22 10:07:34 If oil and gas are added (properly taxed as a Scot Govt would do) what do figures look like then? And are Scots exports from English ports counted? And whisky exports, are they still counted as being U.K./English rather than Scottish? So many anomalies is these deceitful stats.

8321 2018-08-22 10:07:16 I believe some of the spending in Scotland comes via the Barnett formula. However, there are moves to scrap the Barnett formula anyway, so it wouldn't be the same if we went Indy, and more North Sea Oil revenues would be returned to Scotland. Also there are the fx of Brexit.

8348 2018-08-22 10:02:01 U all talk abt oil pls what abt agriculture an other sector
8349 2018-08-22 10:01:51 Flossed and brushed my teeth. I'm going to pull oil probably when I get up and brush them again before I do that. NEVER brush after oil pulling. It makes your teeth hurt
8350 2018-08-22 10:01:40 Just imagine for a second Scotland kept all the tax take from its own oil if £1.3b is 8.4% share.......just imagine
8351 2018-08-22 10:01:39 Ben soğuk sıkım extra virgin oil ve hindistan cevizi yağını yani extra virgin coconut oil i karıştırıp saçıma sürüyorum ve like a virgin gibi oluyorum TOUCH FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
8352 2018-08-22 10:01:37 Oh dear. Whisky export duty. A duty which does not exist. 

The figures released today include Oil revenues (1.3bn). Even including those (it has) Scot land collects less tax and spends more per head than the rUK.

8354 2018-08-22 10:01:27 Girlfriend suggested it. Who am I to say no to getting oil rubbed on my back
8355 2018-08-22 10:01:17 Where is the extra money spent in Scotland? We don’t have more old people as we die early, we don’t have more unemployed, our NHS is funded as a % of UK. It’s U.K. management charges and their mismanagement of our oil that is shafting Scotland. #DissolveTheUnion
8356 2018-08-22 10:01:12 This morning I learned that coconut oil is 'pure poison', and it would be healthier to use lard - I mean the old fashioned type your granny used to use, from the belly of the pig. It's a pity about the coconut oil because it does add nice flavour when cooking.

8366 2018-08-22 09:59:33 We don't really care..    the oil imports and arms exports and the money the Saudis spend investing in this country are more important than someone who broke the STRICT rules of her own chosen religion..
8367 2018-08-22 09:59:16 I really thought I was gonna go to NY with my skin acting up but rose hip oil is getting me right 
8368 2018-08-22 09:59:14 'English taxpayer subsidy'

You mean like all the oil revenue to the exchequer that doesn't get attributed to Scotland?
The whisky exports that get assigned as English revenue as they are sent from a English port or airport? 

Seriously.
8369 2018-08-22 09:59:11 Let hair rest between color treatments. Avoid applying heat to your hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A good hair loss shampoo. or closely related. How will I pin down the legitimate web site. Perfect scent. Easy on the scalp.
8370 2018-08-22 09:59:09 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.

8375 2018-08-22 09:58:21 Well! My 91 year old was chatting to me about olive oil and blocked ears 
8376 2018-08-22 09:58:21 No Middle East (Oil Producing Gulf nation) allows you Paki Rafeeqs to become citizens anyway. They treat you like dirt and throw you out like used toilet paper they're done with you. So your point is moot for gulf nations.

8378 2018-08-22 09:58:01 @gloom you were on ten news (australia) about cocnut oil!!
8379 2018-08-22 09:57:49 National level generality, For last 70 years or so, nuclear & coal was lowest variable cost, meeting all base needs. Coal also met most intermediate needs, supplemented by oil, gas, hydro, energy from waste, etc depending on region. Lastly, most peaking by oil, gas, hydro
8380 2018-08-22 09:57:46 What cowards, the rulers, such a great tragedy, ridiculous that the West puts up with their actions cos of the Oil influence.
8381 2018-08-22 09:57:31 Cooking, as it’s the only oil that needs to be heated over 300 degrees to oxidise... I drink a tablespoon everyday.. It has saved my life.. It’s providing me the Lauric Acid I got from my mum’s breast..
8382 2018-08-22 09:57:08 @WShak1 @AlixPartnersLLP @darracomyn maybe shadow directors and puppets directors was busy? solding eadges on oil,  saying no to all offers, shorting afren share, putting company in delisting , taking care exclusive interest some bondholders and so on
8383 2018-08-22 09:57:08 Is that all Oil revenue or just a percentage ?
8384 2018-08-22 09:57:02 Between 2011 and 2015, the @GEJonathan Administration earned $393 billion in oil revenues. In the last three years the Buhari Administration has earned only $94 billion in oil revenues.
8385 2018-08-22 09:56:59 Don't leave me hanging here, which one was the right oil!?!
8386 2018-08-22 09:56:58 Geez oil revenue was at almost zero in 2016-17, at the whim of world prices and a huge decommissioning bill to pay.
8387 2018-08-22 09:56:53 Dear Alexis,  I work in the oil and gas industry so I am familiar about the s modular refinery initiatives of the govt from OBJ till your present master. The project been touted as achievement is one of so many ongoing private modular refinery projects.
8388 2018-08-22 09:56:52 That’s due to the price of oil fluctuating, not the fact that cutting taxes raises revenues. 

Had oil stayed low, then without a cut in taxes, the revenue from oil would have been even less. Because companies stopped exploration and shut down unproductive wells.
8389 2018-08-22 09:56:41 Quite effective in handing China oil & gas projects abandoned by  EU investors, alienating our globe allies, angering regular Iranian citizens, exposing American foreign policy to be vaccuous....yep, its a real winner, alright!
8390 2018-08-22 09:56:27 How much did Norway make from Oil & Gas  in that same period of time ?

8395 2018-08-22 09:55:33 It is a shame that less than a year to leave office you guys are still playing blame game. what if the people of Niger Delta wake up from their slumber & stop oil exploration in their land the way Ogoni did in 1993 will this government shutdown? Why is everyone depending on oil?
8396 2018-08-22 09:55:32 I consume coconut oil. It's healthy.
8397 2018-08-22 09:55:31 The whole oil industry was mongs who just wanted to point out the fucking obvious I front of management to make it look like they knew what they were doing

8400 2018-08-22 09:55:13 It's like butter vs margarine u avoid saturated fats only to get trans fats. Nutrition vs palatability. If cooking oil, olive oil>corn oil>coco oil. Nutrition/taste/value.
8401 2018-08-22 09:54:39 I just need castor oil at all 
8402 2018-08-22 09:54:36 Great - You chose the one without the comparable oil reserves
8403 2018-08-22 09:54:30 That's nothing compared to the revenue Norway gets from less oil. The UK mismanagement of our oil/ oil industry is astonishing.
8404 2018-08-22 09:54:16 @TheBodyShopUK when are you going to bring out an argan oil body yogurt? 
8405 2018-08-22 09:53:58 The answer to all our problems is Olive oil. 
8406 2018-08-22 09:53:52 Until the average policeman  whether at a checkpoint/office is receiving the salary equivalent or more than the cleaner or an outsourced staff in Shell/NNPC or any major Oil company in Nigeria  they will keep taking bribes and lashing out at the ordinary Nigerians
8407 2018-08-22 09:53:33 The first time I made biscuits I was 18, just learning to cook, helping to make food for a big dinner party. I didn't know there was a difference in taste between vegetable oil and olive oil. The recipe called for oil so I used what was in my friend's kitchen... It was not good.
8408 2018-08-22 09:53:29 Mino Raiola has shown how much a creepy little snake oil sales man knows about football, saying Paul Scholes needs to remind people who he is. Always admired by Man U fans, consistently mentioned by opponents. #pogba

8413 2018-08-22 09:52:56 relatable. it sucks. pretty sure my skin is drowning in oil and just screaming for help
8414 2018-08-22 09:52:52 These are countries illegally and indirectly sucking the oil in Biafra land dry, who always want Nigeria @MBuhari to support their colonialism in Africa. The Biafra freedom is a threat to all of these. How do you want them to react?

8418 2018-08-22 09:52:31 LOVE IT!  You got some great products there! With the Creamed Coconut - there will be oil separation on the top, if you gently heat the jar in a bowl of water it will all melt and you can stir the oil back in - its totally natural and you should only have to do that once 
8419 2018-08-22 09:52:23 My face is the definition of oil. That sounds really gross. Ew.

8422 2018-08-22 09:52:03 Even with the ethically murky planned obsolescence of certain hardware products you never worried about an oil change meaning the death of your car, or a tide pod taking down your washer.
8423 2018-08-22 09:51:39 Whilst the Middle East has had many problems in its past, the Americans never had any valid business there. They only went to ensure that their oil remained cheap.

8426 2018-08-22 09:51:31 Venezuela's problem is that it is located directly above what Rex Tillerson regards as his oil reserves.  He has NED and ALEC, 2 good ol' boys, agitating so that the paternal US will be 'dragged into' yet another fossil fuel conflict.
#constantwar
8427 2018-08-22 09:51:20 So we should hope for oil in our land abi?
8428 2018-08-22 09:51:15 No. No we're not.  The revenue figures in GERS are meaningless as they don't include oil revenue.  Scotland is also given too high a share of UK debt so the spending on that is too high.
8429 2018-08-22 09:50:59 If my wife killed my kids..I am calling police while I hold her down by her neck until they get there simple as that and i sure as hell am not dumping my children in an oil pit..Be real here. This dude is pure evil
8430 2018-08-22 09:50:57 Remind us of the oil revenue tax take between ourselves and Norway
8431 2018-08-22 09:50:54 The country with the highest use of coconut oil, sri Lanka, also has the lowest heart disease and cholesterol related illnesses in the world. Take from that what you will, but I would never trust any science that is funded by entities with a vested interest in a certain result.
8432 2018-08-22 09:50:51  Can you feel the longing? Oil and water have more chemistry.

8442 2018-08-22 09:49:05 Coconut oil pure poison  HOW?
8443 2018-08-22 09:48:53 My understanding is that the 'Unknown Region' allocation applied to Oil only as far as Exports was concerned, because Oil Tax Revenue is allocated on a geographical proportionate basis. The Wings article comments when they were reallocated to Scottish exports shows this.
8444 2018-08-22 09:48:31 Olive Oil?
8445 2018-08-22 09:48:30 No refining ability for heavy oil
8446 2018-08-22 09:48:28 I heard the Ethiopian army lead by Oromo have taking over the Oil field in Jarar,i wonder if that has something to do with it. Jarar Province residents confuse me, i don't know which side they are on,Oromo and Abiy or ONLF.

8452 2018-08-22 09:47:07 I don’t believe there is a singe refinery east of Alberta that can process oilsands oil.
8453 2018-08-22 09:47:04 omg omg !!! that’s a ballsy move shdjfk!!! the best fics were the ones where cas had like,,,, glands that secreted oil?!?!? did u ever read those?!?!?
8454 2018-08-22 09:47:02 Cyclists are saving more than $50 a week. Getting healthy, reducing emissions and cutting our huge oil import bill.
8455 2018-08-22 09:46:59 Coconut oil has been demonized since d 1950s due its high saturated fat content - a fact that Harvard Professor wants to highlight. 
Truth is it is surging in popularity as health food - due its medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), different from long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs).
8456 2018-08-22 09:46:42 #NeverForget @toluogunlesi @ProfOsinbajo @GEJonathan I like being analytical and detailed. Can you please furnish us the yearly earned oil revenues from 2011 - 2017? This data will be more acceptable basis for proper statistical analysis.
8457 2018-08-22 09:46:22 Yes but then the rich oil people wouldn’t get any richer

8459 2018-08-22 09:46:16 Ok, simple terms. 
Independent Scotland could collect our own oil, whisky, farming, fishing, tourism etc revenues & share them between our 6 million citizens, instead of having to share it with 60 million.

8464 2018-08-22 09:45:15 So all that oil revenue that's "Ex Regio" is in there is it? Can you point me to that. Oil licencing revenue? Where do I find that? Supermarkets and retailers based in England VAT and Corp Tax? Where do I find that? GERS is .
8465 2018-08-22 09:45:15 Η Motor Oil βρίσκεται στα 19,80 ευρώ με άνοδο +1,33% και κεφαλαιοποίηση 2,19 δισ. ευρώ.
8466 2018-08-22 09:45:10 GERS is not representative of iScotland. Even so, it shows Scotlands oil revenue  as soaring (despite UK recording billions not to Scotland but to an unknown region) and our economy growing faster than the UK .  We can do much better by being independent.

8474 2018-08-22 09:44:02 Is that like the notional figures for North Sea oil production which extended over thirty years of dishonesty
8475 2018-08-22 09:43:53 There was oil all over the ground at work, so ya know I mopped it up and someone criticized for mopping and told me to just sit there and learn to do nothing. LOL OKAY YEAH NO
8476 2018-08-22 09:43:37 hindi lang medyo beh. hahahah ang pricey niya 100 pesos 10pcs. hahahaha. nkklk yung oil nasa 300++ bibilhin ko pag naubos na to para sulit hahahahha
8477 2018-08-22 09:43:02 So my mum travelled and the cook made some stew, with the amount of oil in the stew I won’t be surprised if the U.S invades us
8478 2018-08-22 09:42:59 The revenue is fair considering how bad the price of oil per barrel  fell drastically. My own opinion though.
8479 2018-08-22 09:42:57 The government of Chávez and their partners ... we are an oil country we should have an rich country but they stole the money ...
8480 2018-08-22 09:42:47 Per Putin orders, Trump is trying to recoup the Russian losses from recent economic sanctions by inflating the oil market by any possible means.
8481 2018-08-22 09:42:41 When oil goes up, all items follow But when it falls, all other items don't fall. They remain up like price of beef in Venezuela. The question is, Why?..
8482 2018-08-22 09:42:41 It’s laughable that he calls himself an international trade and shipping specialist and has no idea of how important it is to the entire Canadian economy that AB gets its oil to tidewater. I sure as hell would never hire him for advice on international trade

8487 2018-08-22 09:42:15 So oil is only $73 a barrel? Why are gas prices so high?
8488 2018-08-22 09:41:33 Na the baby oil way I rub o
8489 2018-08-22 09:40:59 The reason for the sanctions? USA wants regime change and Venezuela decided yo use the  Chinese Yaun rather than the dollar to price oil exports. Which means USA have change the dollar to Yuan in order to buy the oil. A tad inconvenient they say!
8490 2018-08-22 09:40:39 medyo pricey lang noh? Hahhaha parang mas tipid beh yung oil!
8491 2018-08-22 09:40:38 We suffer individually.. Haitians refused increase in oil prices with one voice and it worked
8492 2018-08-22 09:40:36 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
8493 2018-08-22 09:40:35 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

We know who the real  is here.

8507 2018-08-22 09:39:26 'Pure poison' is probably an oversimplification for coconut oil has clear advantages compared to butter or palm oil. But it's obvious it must not be overused (in coffee or smoothie, for instance).
8508 2018-08-22 09:39:26 Life was better for us when the country was importing fuel, but now we are mining our own oil and it's worse... No day did petrol cost ksh 130, but the alleged peoples darling President uhuru kenyatta and Cartels are bound to make Kenya hell, when is our salvation?? #OurOil

8511 2018-08-22 09:38:49 What he neglected to mention was the illegal imposition of sanctions by the USA and Canadian govts! For instance he highlighted the fall in oil exports to just one third of what they had been originally but he didn't relay the information that the USA was their biggest customer..
8512 2018-08-22 09:38:22 The reason for this is if you want an ambulance in London that's fairly cheap to provide 

If you want an ambulance in the outer Hebrides then we are talking expensive

Thus more money is spent in Scotland 

But since the oil boom saved UK in the 70s....
8513 2018-08-22 09:38:08 We have had oil for decades.  Where has all the money gone?
8514 2018-08-22 09:37:40 What do you drive for an oil change to be $200?

8522 2018-08-22 09:35:51 An enlightening facial mask, neon green, with lemon balm, tea tree oil, and exfoliating pumice. The jar it comes in is unlabeled.
8523 2018-08-22 09:35:49 How does coconut oil stay in liquid form? 
8524 2018-08-22 09:35:42 Same. I fall asleep with a face dry like Australian desert and wake up looking like all i've been doing all night is applying butter and olive oil on it
8525 2018-08-22 09:35:05 Good morning, apropos nothing but all oil revenues in the world should tend to zero- the question is how, and how soon.
8526 2018-08-22 09:34:59 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa. I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating doughnut instead of rubbing the oil on his head.

8527 2018-08-22 09:34:58 it’s oil good!
8528 2018-08-22 09:34:51 The energies of the 21st and future centuries are renewable. Atom and oil were the energies of the 20th century, coal was the energy of the 19th century.
This man is not the man of the future but of a past past.
One does not become great by regressing.
8529 2018-08-22 09:34:37 Heh indeed. I find it works best when all different dept understand what other dept do, including the fact that while we all want new features, the machinery might need oil change and a bit of tune-up every now and then. In the end of the day, we all want a better product.
8530 2018-08-22 09:34:29 Were you talking about tight oil or kerogen?  Seems like the latter.

8534 2018-08-22 09:33:47 Ha ha! It's also a saturated fat with a load of hype behind it.  As a soapmaker, in the context of palm oil boycotts,  I was suspicious about its sudden elevation to all round miracle oil.  Olive oil is far better!

It's much better then yesterday so a broken rib has been ruled out. Off to a GP after my show today. @JohnPritchard19 @SusieNewsey
8548 2018-08-22 09:31:56 Come on @theprojecttv. Do some investigative reporting on coconut oil. It’s not just a fad thing. @ChristineCronau can give you some facts too.
8549 2018-08-22 09:31:40 Some guys vigorously remove the oil out of their fries, and here I am, wiping the burger grease off my plate using fries.
8550 2018-08-22 09:31:38 @theprojecttv wow a 30 second scare piece about coconut oil and butter with no science or balance and an overweight nutrition expert saying to avoid saturated fat  am I watching the daily mail on TV?

8552 2018-08-22 09:31:30 And Scotland has produced significant oil revenues for decades.  Where has all the money gone?
8553 2018-08-22 09:31:24 Funny, all those well dressed Better Together politicians told us that oil has no value. Hmmmm, almost like we were taken for idiots?

8558 2018-08-22 09:30:42 Of course as Blair had in UK over the lies to Parliament on #Iraq & #WMD that "could be deployed in 45 minutes". When as @FuelOnTheFire a well researched & cross referenced book showed Blair lied it was always about the oil fields. As it is now for #Venezuela nothing less.
8559 2018-08-22 09:30:37 I find Clinique products for Men are so good, oil control face wash which really works, seem to be getting spots on nose, which you can mask out, but nothing takes them away completely. any ideas? they go but return.
8560 2018-08-22 09:30:34 Coconut oil is full of medium chain fatty acids, which are very very good for you. Calories and nutrition are not the same thing. Overeating the “healthiest” of foods will lead to weight gain and that then negates the nutritional benefits. #TheProjectTV

8567 2018-08-22 09:30:00 Coconut oil has been described as 'pure poison' and 'one of the worst foods you can eat', by a Harvard university professor.

8571 2018-08-22 09:29:33 ....and North sea oil is the hardest & most expensive in the world to extract hence less less revenues. Compared with the fact Norway's basin is less mature & gov part own statoil which gives the government pure profit and not just tax on profit.
8572 2018-08-22 09:29:30 The last study which was against coconut oil turned out to be funded by (as we as others) The California Walnut Commission, Ag Canada and Canola Oil Council and The National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Any proper journalist worth their wage packet should digging beyond...

8580 2018-08-22 09:28:04 The red oil adds a certain taste I think. Had that taste in Abeokuta the only other place I’ve eaten Ofada rice. This is just off.
8581 2018-08-22 09:27:54 Please, what is the basis for this "report"? Have you factored in the fact that crude oil prices peaked at over $140pb in 2012 and averaged just over $100pb between 2009 and 2013? Compare that to a peak of $75pb now and an average of $55pb between 2015 & 2018....

Its oil from unknown source ffs how can you think its ok to cheat scots like this?

8638 2018-08-22 09:19:30 You're right. Thatcher put 4.5 million on the dole and into poverty. Chavez didn't do anything as bad. In fact, health outcomes and poverty figures improved once the oil shutdown was dealt with. I'm no fan of Chavez but we still live Thatcher's butchering of UK industry today.

8781 2018-08-22 08:57:30 'Climate Change' is a neutral term the oil industry adopted to replace the description in use - Global Climatic Warming. All media have compliantly adopted the 'Climate Change' phrase, which infers a natural event & not a man made one.

8796 2018-08-22 08:55:04 Yes. But seems like messaging on boycotting palm oil is more rampant and effective rather than promoting sustainable palm oil
8797 2018-08-22 08:55:04 Thanks for your input Daniel, we have to encourage and reward sustainable practices in palm oil production if we want to reduce deforestation and biodiversity loss.

8931 2018-08-22 08:25:37 Every barrel of oil we buy there is already an American 'tax' on it through the Swift payment system. Our 2 refineries are owned by America, which carries a further 'tax'.

8932 2018-08-22 08:25:21 You may be surprised but I think Scotland should now become an independent country within the EU, despite all the separation issues.

9032 2018-08-22 08:04:39 There is no definitive evidence that saturated fat causes atherosclerosis. I’m not pro coconut oil, but the so called specialists in this field are deriding something based on a ‘truth’ that simply isn’t. Atherosclerosis results from damaged vessel walls.

9034 2018-08-22 08:04:30 So cleansing milk ni consider facial wash biasa la ae? Sbb bila baca ada yg kata cleansing milk ni mcm oil based cleanser. Means, cleansing milk first, then facial wash biasa. Ke cemana ni tsk tsk

9036 2018-08-22 08:03:13 Not endorsing communism but Chavezism was never Communism. Massively consumerist country with huge gap b’n rich & poor. Right to have nationalised oil industries as biggest asset flowing to US  but biggest mistake was not using oil wealth to diversify economy thereafter.

9093 2018-08-22 07:54:30 I looked into “sustainable palm oil” and it appeared to just be oil from areas where virgin forest had been cut down some time ago. Best avoid ALL palm oil.
9094 2018-08-22 07:54:29 laxatone is cat laxative from pet shop (in US) which is like petroleum jelly. Put it on their paws so they will lick it off. Also any sort of olive oil or such on dry food, tuna in oil not water, as Effel said. Helps with hair balls.

9110 2018-08-22 07:51:33 Or are you saying that it was bad for Chavez to use Venezuela's oil wealth to relieve the suffering of his country's destitute? That's what it seems like to me. IMO, Chavez was as bad as Thatcher. He failed to use oil receipts to invest in his country just as she did here.

9129 2018-08-22 07:48:34 The economy came down because Venezuela can't keep up with oil production to pay for their programs. They failed to reinvest their oil profits into their oil sector.

9237 2018-08-22 07:32:32 Incorrect; every developed country has a stockpile of oil, coal, food, medicines, blankets, gas masks, inoculations, tents etc. The difference is that today and in the UK some are speaking about it. One group to reassure and the other to cause fear. The EU cannot blackmail us.

9301 2018-08-22 07:21:23 but oil is the reason they have been fucked up. selling at that price against opec regulation isbself regulating n the reason their currency have been turned like zimbabwe. maybe you should convert 1bolivar to dollar then we see
9302 2018-08-22 07:21:23 The heading is misleading, it says over use is coconut oil is poison. The author has not quoted any study which says coconut oil is poison. Content of this article is diametrically opposite to what heading suggests. Standard way of propagating agends

9306 2018-08-22 07:20:55 I would think selling snake oil to your voters is more a by-product of campaign profiling. Once your political strategy is based attracting gulible voters, you might as well take the opportunity to sell them useless things and make some cash in addition to votes.

9317 2018-08-22 07:18:54 Dear Mam with due respect,
She did right...
Then,

Do you support that how you earned money it dosent matter just donate it & it is ok??
It's like destroying IRAK or other countries for sake of crude oil by Western countries??
9318 2018-08-22 07:18:52 I’ve started giving my pup CBD oil for dogs in the morning and evening just to see if anything helps. He’s willingly eating and drinking a little more on his own. Peeing and finally pooping again (from eating more?). More mobile and alert. I remain Cautiously optimistic.

9327 2018-08-22 07:17:16 I'm not talking today, I'm saying Qc and On financed Alberta settlement, its development, than in the 70s heavily helped the development of oil sands. At that time AB economy was nothing. And when in 20 years from now oil demand drops drastically, we'll still be there.
9328 2018-08-22 07:17:16 Now that is good bt bad as well because over reliance on oil when oil prices fall your economy suffers heavily
9329 2018-08-22 07:17:16 Its also a consequence of living on a island during hurricane season. President Trump has invested more money in solar wind than Obama has at this time in his first term so how your draw that republicans are completely connected to oil is a stretch.
9330 2018-08-22 07:17:09 I never mentioned anyone's skin tone. It's a matter of legal presence. Murder and violence by illegals is totally preventable. If they aren't here they can't harm anyone. In Texas we have 25,000 of them incarcerated right now. More are roaming free.
9331 2018-08-22 07:17:05 Kudos to our economic management team! It's really not so easy with the way things went. Things could have been very bad. Look at Venezuela that we were in the same shoes in the oil crash. Thank God for @MBuhari.
9332 2018-08-22 07:16:50 Not just oil then? :)
9333 2018-08-22 07:16:21 Yes, and yields rose with inflation spurred by fiscal spending, monetary growth and demographics (—> oil price hikes). The world is a very different place now. Trade disputes could boost US inflation but that may damage growth because of squeeze on real incomes at lower end.

9337 2018-08-22 07:15:52 The fuel prices have no relation to the state of economy. If you researched just a little further, you'd learn that they are oil producers and their petrol prices are also subsidised.

9371 2018-08-22 07:10:50 I do agree and believe oil sands are a good revenue generator for our country. However an economy that is too concentrated on primary resources is a weak economy. We must focus on secondary and tertiary industries; transformation and consumers services.

9439 2018-08-22 07:00:50 Winter tip: 

If you’re finding your skin is super dry atm, use a combination of grapeseed and your favourite essential oil in the shower, it’s so good for your skin, smells great and will distract you from from the ongoing existential nightmare that is politics in this country.

9455 2018-08-22 06:58:23 Planet security isn't oil.
9456 2018-08-22 06:58:23 Mine is older, you know like 1st generation, so mostly it just projects oil on the ground when you unlock it at night... or just leave it sitting.
9457 2018-08-22 06:57:53 Yea, meen, the politics of oil is brutal. 
Hugo Chavez was able to hack the whole thing and the country was really doing well... until the oil prices went down.
Could it be because the economy depended heavily on oil?

You are not serious with your destiny lol
9460 2018-08-22 06:57:25 Trash! You can't even generate funds to run your own government. You have been shouting diversify the economy since you came in, but you can't keep your head of the oil thing. You guys can keep fooling the fools. Some of us are wiser. Past is gone Oga work

9464 2018-08-22 06:56:50 I know this may sound weird but the best way to control oil on your face is with oil (speaking from experience). Try jojoba oil, it's the closest to our skin's sebum. Use a drop or two after toner. Any good brand face oil would work too. You can read up more on it and find out.
9465 2018-08-22 06:56:47 have you heard the way she says oil please I hate it so much sjsjsjs
9466 2018-08-22 06:56:44 Sometimes my panic attacks just happen without anything triggering them. I have a hard time breathing... my heart feels like it’s beating 1000 x a minute.

9471 2018-08-22 06:55:19 Apart from the oil. Have you seen how they have dropped everything and waged an all out propaganda war on Canada? Actually, it might be a good place to send a few ministers over to deliver it in person. A few might not return though lmao.

9475 2018-08-22 06:55:09 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
9476 2018-08-22 06:55:07 Ooh nice! Gw paling suka pake aromatic oils tbh xD terakhir malah bikin aromatic oil sendiri karena dibeliin herbs mayan banyak pas Mama ke Turki

9484 2018-08-22 06:53:52 Someone moved my oil bottle and stuffed it downside my exhaust at snetterton, my bike caught fire by lap 2. Watch your bikes to.
9485 2018-08-22 06:53:38 I saw that too that time but I just ignored coz its very stupid to compare an oil with a full body lotion and soap etc so I just let them wallow in their stupidity
9486 2018-08-22 06:52:58 Now what springs to mind....hmmmm.

Note, I've excluded all the shiny things I bought for me and the bike which I didn't strictly need
9491 2018-08-22 06:51:32 They should stop drinking the oil and giving chinese some to further their agenda #OurOil
9492 2018-08-22 06:51:31 There are big "transparency deficits", "accountability deficits" & "knowledge deficits" in #ExtractivesEA. A big gulf btwn extractives law, and the practice.

9498 2018-08-22 06:51:00 Americans kill Americans so an illegal alien who shouldn't be here to begin with is just normal? Americans we can't do anything about until after the fact. Illegal aliens we can keep out, deport them and stop crime before it happens. Big difference

9503 2018-08-22 06:50:10 It is best to cook kale in coconut oil. That way it doesn’t stick to the pan as you scoop it into the trash.

9505 2018-08-22 06:50:05 Nah it’s good... let the price drop... they can go back to canola and vegetable oil and leave us be.
9506 2018-08-22 06:50:02 I understand U Bro. I'm saying this present crops of leaders won't do it. Y do U think we aren't talking of d solid minerals development as much as we talk of oil? There's no quick cash in it. Nigerian leaders are greedy & self-centered.
9507 2018-08-22 06:49:23 Deal.
Has I said support ind. England with hard border to Scotland you keep the oil. Take all your citizens back North too (will miss Charlie Mulgrew)
If you think Scotland will have an equal say to Germany you are deluded. You will dance to Merkels tune just as Greece as danced.

9512 2018-08-22 06:49:00 This is a monumental moment, for once Bernie Sanders and I agree on something.  Humans need to stop relying on oil, electricity. Humans don't need these to survive. But we do need air and water.

9520 2018-08-22 06:47:26 N i have been telling this thing to all my relatives for past 6 months now but they still prefer olive oil than ghee... but according to me ghee is the best! In haryana villages people are fit n healthy by eating ghee only!
9521 2018-08-22 06:47:24 Saudi Arabia is a degenerate & barbaric nation zealously following & exporting a faith that prescribes such 'values', including punishments by execution. US shouldn't use it as a military base. It should occupy, colonise, civilise & Christianise it & take its oil. Problem solved.

$ also back to 1.29 vs £, which will not help the FTSE 100 opening today, but better news for oil.
9530 2018-08-22 06:46:10 True - coconut oil is much more stable at high temperatures and so safer to use in cooking because it doesn't form trans fats like olive oil and other mono & poly unsaturated fat oils do - Coconut oil is my prefered oil to use for all my cooking & baking :)
9531 2018-08-22 06:46:09 That's why 25% of fed inmates and similar numbers in border states are illegal when they make up 3% or so pop?

There is a difference

9542 2018-08-22 06:44:22 @SkyNews Coconut oil is made up of medium chain triglycerides. These are c8, c10 and c12 (length of carbon chains) makes them easily digestible. On the other hand sunflower, palm and rape oil are long chain triglycerides ( c14, c16 and c18) which makes digestion harder.

9595 2018-08-22 06:36:32 Well d way govt is functioning is itself questionable. Full demonetization data has still not been made public, tax burden on tax payers is increasing annually, tax on oil is very high, Bank NPA increased manifold after 2014, Bank frauds increased, fraudsters easily left country.

9619 2018-08-22 06:32:52 The US dollar is backed by nothing, the only reason it's still relevant is because we force the entire planet to trade oil in US currency. Or you can demand gold for your oil and end up like Gaddafi.

9630 2018-08-22 06:29:48 Is there any hope for the cure from cancer with CBD oil?  Hearing many success stories, after watching 4 dear friends suffer through chemo n radiation, I’d certainly give it a chance!  Would you?
9631 2018-08-22 06:29:37 Yes, Part of this scheme developed from the Koch Brothers father - who made his fortune collaborating with the Hitler and Stalin (he built their oil refineries). He then was a founder of the radical right wing John Birch society which the CNP took over.
9632 2018-08-22 06:29:19 Eucerin has a great cleanser, gentle but also firm on spots. I use it and have recommended to a few spot prone pals! I also used to really love the Witch cleansers. And for moisturiser I swear by Nivea oil free, have used it my whole life!

9646 2018-08-22 06:26:42 Countries like China that are so reviled by our moronic American leaders, are actually taking responsibility for their own pollution, and bettering themselves....while American brags about burning for fucking oil, gas, and coal...and destroys other countries to get it...
9647 2018-08-22 06:26:33 Coconut oil has been used down the century by Indians.The benefits reaped are innumerable.I beg to differ.
9648 2018-08-22 06:26:30 as if the FG earned $390b

9654 2018-08-22 06:25:55 This is 1 of your most stupid comments. During the period 1999-2014 Venezuela earned more money with oil than ever before despite giving oil away. The money was not used for maintenance, new construction and future investments in the PDVSA or infrastructure and now they can’t?

9657 2018-08-22 06:24:32 and rose hip seed oil by the ordinary. and then i use the simple brand face wash and toner and cleanser. but i definitely credit bahi & the glow pot for the complete difference 
9658 2018-08-22 06:24:14 It was coming ... Isn't it? 

1/3 of UAE GDP comes from OIL. They need labourer to explore that oil, 99% of their labourer are foreigners, with Indian contributing 27% of their population and most of them are from Kerala! 

The offer makes all the sense!
9659 2018-08-22 06:24:11 True, but they make really great oil don't forget.
9660 2018-08-22 06:23:59 Anyone think this might  actually be about coal and not oil?
9661 2018-08-22 06:23:51 Breakfast pasta, cook up some pasta, throw in a pan with a bit of oil, chile and bit of chopped bacon, cook thru.   Scramble 2 eggs with some milk dried parsley and black pepper.  Mix with pasta, toss until cooked thru, plate up and eat.  That will keep you going...

9841 2018-08-22 05:49:16 Khaboen ki dunya sey nikal aao. Try to do something concrete like formulating policies conducive for increasing investment & exports. Oil prices b freezed for at least three month to have a clear cost impact on exports. Dollar price needs to b stabilized around Rs 120/.

9844 2018-08-22 05:49:06 Matthew/Mark or whoever you are still didn’t answer the real question and you will not . What was earlier the “sanctions” or the shortages and destruction of Venezuela’s own industry? What is done with the huge oil income that Venezuela needs external banks to buy basic needs?
9845 2018-08-22 05:48:54 Growth slowed in Q1 2018 and not all of the 46 economic activities witnessed any growth. 21 sectors had negative growth.

CBN FX interventions and OPEC supply cut may momentarily make the figures look rosier but the recovery is tepid at best barring any fall in oil prices/volume.
9846 2018-08-22 05:48:49 Then there was that all-American husband who killed his wife and kids, and stuck their bodies in oil drums. But he was legal, right?

9851 2018-08-22 05:47:23 I recommend you read the book 
Confessions of an economic hitman by John Perkins, he covers Venezuela's oil Industry extensively.

It's definitely foreign sabotage in conjunction with weak domestic governing  structure's after the referendum.

9866 2018-08-22 05:45:06 Cricket is good.Not sure about 80% line? If Scot taxation including oil is say 60b and pocket money back is half that then Barnett consequential are wrong as is apportioning debt and costs.

 No need to ask questions.. 

He tipped the contents over the vampires head and kicked the pan aside. 

“All lubed up and satisfied,  Now leave..”
9885 2018-08-22 05:41:48 He was raised near El Paso in a Hispanic neighborhood. The Spanish nickname for Robert is Beto. And he's had that nickname since he was a child, so....

I'm fine with Beto.
9886 2018-08-22 05:41:28 Also maybe let the family grieve a little before you use their daughters murder for your anti immigration shit. Have you even mentioned the American man who murdered his wife and two children before stuffing their bodies in oil tanks. Probably not bc it’s not part of your agenda.

9892 2018-08-22 05:40:42 This is dangerously misinformed to the point of stupidity. Britian isnt reliant upon oil prices to simply survive.

9948 2018-08-22 05:30:34 From what I understand, since the Brent/Light crude differential now doesn’t justify the near $10 toll that each barrel of oil gets tacked on with EE like it used to, it’s no longer as feasible as a replacement to light crude imports.

9960 2018-08-22 05:27:53 I think an analysis of African countries can give a different perspective, because with the exception of oil producing countries, the bulk of them buy of global markets and factors such as transport and margins can be compared almost directly.

9980 2018-08-22 05:24:48 LA SALIDA ES SALIR DEL RÉGIMEN. NM no es presidente,sus actos son nulos y la vice es ilegítima:fue nombrada por NM usurpando cargo. Exijamos a @AsambleaVE o @TSJ_Legitimo nombre gobierno emergencia,al cual reconocerá la CI, qe pida ya IH y reciba/administre pagos x oil export

9993 2018-08-22 05:22:44 But the cause of the crisis was:
1) Fall in Oil prices
2) Turning to communism
3)loans from China and Russia

What America is solely responsible for is Iran

9998 2018-08-22 05:21:43 Always have loved this guy. He fought big oil and they faked a shortage. He stopped gun running down south so billionaires attacked. He knew right from wrong and chose correctly. He needed a pit bull vp thats all. God has you sir
9999 2018-08-22 05:21:25 And does a shorter growing season mean lower oil content in the hops?

10006 2018-08-22 05:19:32 To say the functions of the market are inherently rational, despite artificial scarcity in housing, oil, food, diamonds, or any commodity, is also faith. You define rational by what the market does. You can’t criticize it then. That’s faith, fundamentalism.

10011 2018-08-22 05:19:16 No, the world continues to use oil because, it remains the best option for a range of energy and other needs. If there was a better economic and technical option people would use that. Global oil demand continues to increase. Pipelines don’t increase oil demand.
