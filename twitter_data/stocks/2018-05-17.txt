43 2018-05-17 23:27:43 @realDonaldTrump The Elite control the stock market as they had to show you a couple times so when they have money on hold it is going into stocks they know will make a good profit then afterwards they deposit the money into our accounts like they were suppose to do initially.

44 2018-05-17 23:25:25 stocks are up, issa good day
45 2018-05-17 23:24:52 Yes I agree that some stocks are overvalued and are coming home to roost but PEs should be looked at not just across broader market but within their respective industries. NCB has retreated from last years high despite having one of the biggest run ups.
46 2018-05-17 23:24:49 I suppose I should join the snowflake nation. But in order to do so honestly I'm going to have to give up on my stocks. I assume you're type oppose a strong market. Also I'm going to adopt an ms-13 member and ensure they know you! I can't surrender my guns tho. Can I join you?

54 2018-05-17 23:14:10 I’ve called for $80 #oil months ago.  If you subscribe to my letter you are riding the wave with our US oil stocks.  We might be in for a small near term pullback baring any Mideast fireworks.  Took some profits

56 2018-05-17 23:11:11 You are 100% spot on, mate.

That beats Nasdaq's 6.9% gain.

But can you name a single microcap stock?
59 2018-05-17 23:06:28 as you can see the dow is down a couple of 2000 points from it's high back in January.  Stock prices are inflated because of buy backs.  If things go back for Trump stocks will probabaly fall farther.  As it is no real reason why the market should be so high
60 2018-05-17 23:05:59 @realDonaldTrump  You figure if FB has millions of people using this new fund raiser system of theirs than can make out like thieves hanging on to all their money and collecting interests on it or re-investing it into something else like those day stocks that jump all over.

65 2018-05-17 22:58:16 Well, yea. There's a good reason why some of these stocks have high short interest. But I'm not looking to get married to these stocks. I only want to trade them during the SQUEEZE-fest!

90 2018-05-17 22:40:59 Hey, if I may ask... how did you get into trading currencies? 
My background is trading stocks. But I like the aspect that the currency trading market is open around the clock—I feel there is more opportunities to find trades. But everybody is different and has a different story.
91 2018-05-17 22:40:40 There are multiple articles and websites geared around what stocks to buy based on the arms deals the US makes with other countries.

112 2018-05-17 22:26:26 Agree! Peace in Korea, peace in Iran, peace in Israel, the largest tax cut in the HISTORY of the US, beginning of a big, beautiful, see-thru border wall that will be paid by Mexico, jobs, jobs, jobs, a massive trade surplus with China, bump stocks and 18-21 solved. All in 17.
113 2018-05-17 22:24:42 401k’s and IRA’s include mutual funds made up of company stocks...that’s how employees become investors even if they don’t own stock outside their retirement plans. Not 100% of employees are owners but millions are.
114 2018-05-17 22:23:11 Stocks are investments in companies that, ideally, actually employ people to do things and provide a good or service

That's 600 rounds per minute. Bump stocks are capable of shooting 800 rounds per minute. Make a correction. BIATCH!

132 2018-05-17 22:07:44 I'll see if anyone stocks it. But if it makes me drowsy at all I'll have to skip it.
133 2018-05-17 22:07:15 i'm selling my starbuck stocks.
134 2018-05-17 22:05:24 Algorithms don’t trade much in these kind of stocks, except basic arbitrage. Probably more the overcrowding of the common gapping strategies.

136 2018-05-17 22:03:49 There is a reason you need 25k in account to day trade traditional stocks and options etc and that’s to keep out the weak hands that overreact to anything and everything and create mass volatility.
137 2018-05-17 22:01:48 Bet somebody bought capriccio stocks last week just fucking around and then looked at it this week and said “wtf”
138 2018-05-17 22:01:28 love the argument that crypto currencies have no real world use.... apparently everyone forgot about the stocks and bonds they hold which ACTUALLY have no real world application.... when was the last time you bought something with a share? Or sent someone a share?..exactly STFU!

140 2018-05-17 21:58:41 To be clear, both Yelloweye Rockfish and Cowcod are still in rebuilding plans because they haven't yet rebuilt to the 40% target. But along with all other west coast rockfish stocks, they are no longer below the minimum stock size threshold (25% in both cases).
141 2018-05-17 21:58:39 I could make a halfway decent case for his nasty comments consistently making me money, because these stocks always persevere despite him and his garbage.

150 2018-05-17 21:52:15 @NRA @TedNugent @dbongino - Dan you have great responses to the horrible media. There is a way to counter them everyone needs to be on board. If people buy stocks like CNN And Dicks sporting goods. We can use our voice to vote the CEO’s and board out.LET THE NRA use proxy votes
151 2018-05-17 21:51:53 Painter has cited the statute. Some of those stocks are owned jointly. Medtronic CEO held fund raiser for his shareholder-cum-Senator. She can fix before primary if she wants to rep MN voters.

162 2018-05-17 21:42:40 The fact that I could get in a shit load of trouble... due to the fact that I’m hanging out with the guy who stocks the vending machine. And I know how everyone is when it comes to food. 
163 2018-05-17 21:41:49 @kieranmcg88 kieranmcg88if you speak to the store manager they should be able to help to get in requested lines/check out of stocks that's what I do for customers that request items
164 2018-05-17 21:41:13 With stocks not far off their highs, does this mean much more upside to come when/if the data start surprising to the upside?
165 2018-05-17 21:40:29 my favorite person that i’ve met at barnes and noble thus far is carol, the lady who stocks greeting cards and said that she has submitted a story about how she left Apple for Samsung to the New Yorker several times

170 2018-05-17 21:34:54 Totally, I hated working 9-5 days for someone else to reap the benefits of my efforts, whereas in crypto/stocks your effort is proportional to reward. Not to mention the freedom! If I fancy a 3hr lunch break, a day off, holiday etc. I don't need someone's "permission"
171 2018-05-17 21:34:44 Buying stocks mean you believe in the financial health of the company. Not only the wealthy buy stocks. Everyone with a pension, 401K or IRA probably own stock. You have a lifelong tax paid pension, so of course don’t know jack about corporations.
172 2018-05-17 21:34:07 So we should all carry AR’s with bump stocks?

191 2018-05-17 21:23:19 Banning bump stocks and military style weapons intended for WAR, not killing innocent civilians would have saved those people in Las Vegas. Military style weapons are designed to kill as many as efficiently as possible. No civilian needs that. Good grief.

200 2018-05-17 21:19:35 The stock market still has to come to terms with rising rates being good for stocks.
201 2018-05-17 21:19:23 A couple lessons I have learned over the years.....

1. The best way to get a feel for the overall market is thru looking at the action of leading individual stocks in leading sectors. It shows the underlying tone.

AND...
202 2018-05-17 21:17:38 As well as implementing stricter background checks and classes, we will also regulate the bump stocks and magazines available to the public. These allow for more rounds and if the sole purpose of having a gun is to protect yourself, then you don’t need that many rounds.

478 2018-05-17 18:44:10 "On the other side, the capital account includes the buying and selling of investment assets such as real estate, stocks, bonds, and government securities."

The only way a TD can continue over the long term is if the money flows back for capital/debt rather than goods/services. So the other countries buy USGOV securities and US real estate, stocks, bonds, until the flows balance, because they must balance.

536 2018-05-17 18:11:09 $VLO a stone cold short after $MS upgraded it today. Upgrades that occur on stocks at multi-year highs and up 30% or more in 3 months or less are the kiss of death. Stock will head back to $100 within 2 months....
537 2018-05-17 18:09:52 No FUD here.
I am deep in $ZIL with you both.
But I have a ton more experience wrt stocks, penny stocks, private cos and VC deals that can crush investors. ICOs lack the regulatory protection that securities have, so we are vulnerable waters. Doesn't mean problem, just eyes open!

546 2018-05-17 18:05:30 So far a lot of growth stocks have gapped up on earnings or otherwise thrust higher off the recent market low. That said, few have followed thru to the upside....yet. So far it's normal but want to see some follow-thru buying before concluding the rally is the real McCoy
547 2018-05-17 18:05:06 "By sticking to his value investing paradigm, and refusing to buy stocks of companies whose prices are above a certain multiple of discounted cash flow, or other value metrics" => A certain multiple of discounted cash flow? Da faq is that?

684 2018-05-17 16:54:25 Imagine that.
Sir, you have done more in one week than the bullshit "media" has even attempted to do since Putin colluded with  this pussy grabber. He's in the WH buying selling stocks, creating chaos in the Middle East and the fucking nerve to be sarcastic over serious events.
685 2018-05-17 16:54:24 Been getting to sell my shares of stocks  for more profit then what I bought them more. Patience is key 
686 2018-05-17 16:53:31 Here's an "olive branch" for all law abiding gun owners in the city of Boulder Colorado. You get to keep your legally bought "Assault weapons" but have to destroy or sell your legally bought "high capacity mags" and bump stocks. These policies are B.S. and won't save anyone
687 2018-05-17 16:52:39 You passed a tax plan that relies on taking away healthcare and food assistance for the poorest Americans, and gives billions to companies that then buy their stocks back and inflate the costs. And Obama had straight economic growth after he saved us from G.W. Bush's own TARP.

692 2018-05-17 16:50:00 To be clear... 

Playbook something like this - market opens, stocks fall heavily, volume drops, eur closes or time passes (but NOT option expiration) and they, slowly, methodically, bid asset prices back up in low volume.

More irresponsible financial Journalism. The finical industry news looks more  like Political news you would see from  CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post and the New York Times.  CNBC - "When earnings look this great, it's actually a really bad time to invest in stocks" LOL
712 2018-05-17 16:43:24 Yeah. Some hell of buying in Dec. Finally, consensus building that last WASDE report is not bearish. Infact the true ending stocks could be much lower than projected. Well, most of the specs are probably systematic. Returns chase returns.

722 2018-05-17 16:38:29 honestly stocks and investment markets in general are absurd and bad for humanity
723 2018-05-17 16:38:09 Agreed. Passive is basically a large cap momentum strategy, so flows into passive will simply reinforce that with more money going into the largest stocks.
724 2018-05-17 16:38:08 RCom volume ratio is 6.5, which is indeed very high. But we have an unusually large number of high volume ratio stocks today, and RCom got edged out. (Cutoff in the list is 7.8)

727 2018-05-17 16:37:01 Let’s not forget the ones that post watch lists with stocks that nobody is trading, and then they want to say they are not chat pumpers. Funny part is most of the stocks on their lists dont even move. Idk how people still pay them.
728 2018-05-17 16:36:46 Hello, what do you invest in if not small-cap stocks?
729 2018-05-17 16:35:51 Oil surge spurs Wall Street turnaround, sends Russell 2000 to record: (Reuters) - Energy and industrial stocks led Wall Street higher on Thursday and the small-cap Russell 2000 hit a record, even as a rise in U.S. bond yields to fresh seven-year highs suggested more competition…
730 2018-05-17 16:35:36 European Stocks were mostly higher, shaking off an early stumble. Energy and industrial companies climbed, offsetting losses in technology and health care stocks. The price of crude oil rose.
731 2018-05-17 16:35:31 Stocks are at $50 a share and up by a 15% rise
732 2018-05-17 16:35:30 U.S.Stocks were little changed, with major indexes erasing mild early declines to turn positive, though tech stocks remained lower on the day and investors continued to watch a rise in bond yields.

Perhaps @Eurovision win is a coincident indicator, but I don't think it signals a top
736 2018-05-17 16:33:44 doesn't have to be stocks. could be a high in something else (or a low). they are just turn dates. Maybe crude? Dollar? Bonds? Surely something to watch

801 2018-05-17 16:00:06 I see cement as a huge play in the next 3-5 years. Hold hold stocks, not the large ones! The ones who will gain market share when the smaller cement companies shut down. Huge value unlocking there.
802 2018-05-17 15:59:55 Hey Mark. Sorry about the tweet spamming, but I noticed that most of your stocks have really good gross margins rather than operating margins. Do you think that once a company has good gross margins, the operating margins will follow and the stock will still gain interest? 
803 2018-05-17 15:59:51 One did and was actually quite nice about it. I still had to resign up to their mailing list, but still, I pointlessly made my point.
804 2018-05-17 15:58:57 Jgh. I only have few stocks left, I need more  asap!

808 2018-05-17 15:57:22 Either the US trade frictions/uncertainty will expand to include all of Europe, or Europe and Iran will scramble to produce new Iranian agreements that Trump can embrace. The process to a conclusion may be troubling to both stocks and commodities for a period of time.

813 2018-05-17 15:53:34 A bump stock isn't the functional equivalent of a machine gun. It negatively affects the way the weapon fires to a degree that you can generally do more damage just pulling the trigger fast. Going after bump stocks is a smokescreen to distract us from the weapon itself.
814 2018-05-17 15:53:31 Fat is I am notnworried about $fat. Everything crashed in 2018 . It will turn . Almost every stock is down 50% or more from thier highs in 2017 . But the fact is u bashed all pot stocks and they had massive runs . Now u are lying again about your short on $Fat.
815 2018-05-17 15:52:46 On one hand it seems bullish that stocks only yawned during this spike in rates. 

On the other hand Gartman is currently bullish.

826 2018-05-17 15:48:39 Using behaviour stupidity of MF/FII guys to add into some of already holding stocks & a new illiquid stock which I was trying to buy but getting small qty. Now K,taka political drama gave chance to buy.

841 2018-05-17 15:42:29 Today they’re not great. But all the oil, technology, and WWE stocks are doing really well.
842 2018-05-17 15:42:21 If you use trending inflation rate of 17.1% as the discounting factor, 100k next year would be like 85,400.
While 5m, if invested in stocks, funds and debentures (definitely not in a savings account) with moderate to high interest rates would yield better income.

844 2018-05-17 15:41:03 No,hang on to them. I'm sure you consulted with an independent expert. Stockbrokers, financial experts and even accountants never lie or hype of stocks for the sake of gulling people. Look at Enron. Have a nice day. :-)

846 2018-05-17 15:39:40 I don't think you understand how actually slow that is.... it takes constant reinvestment of your cash.... meaning you're not getting the same price on stocks. Also you need 100s to 1000s of the same stock to just "sit on it " for any sort of viability.

865 2018-05-17 15:34:10 The reason I ask is that if [big IF] a large sustained seller emerges, it would much more likely be someone like @FBGCapital who probably is sitting on a pile of $ZIL they received in exchange for investing fiat in the project. In stocks this is restricted, in crypto maybe not?

887 2018-05-17 15:24:07 I'm not saying the provider's job is too hard but you fail to appreciate exactly what they're up against. Your adviser is the one to blame here, there's no point telling people who have seen the transfer process from the provider's side to "get over it".

894 2018-05-17 15:20:30 The expectation is that the adviser will forward the information to the member. In most cases, that's what happens. There may be more providers now who will issue copies to the member but I don't know if they all do.

900 2018-05-17 15:16:55 Exactly but you'd be surprised by how many clients ignore the warnings and prefer to ring the provider, shouting and screaming that we're holding onto their money and they want it transferred NOW. The statutory right stands. It's not uncommon for that to happen btw.

926 2018-05-17 15:01:33 Stocks are currently trading in positive territory this morning.  MBS is near unchanged (+2bps), as well as Yields (3.10%).
927 2018-05-17 15:01:19 You prefer ETF or stocks for options?

930 2018-05-17 14:58:56 Study 8:4 But we must not suppose that it was any thing similar to those tubs or barrels ridiculously set up in churches and chapels, in which a preacher is nearly as much confined, during the time of his preaching, as if he was in the stocks.
931 2018-05-17 14:57:53 .I thought Obama was coming for your guns?

Trump just came for your bump-stocks, and even said he'll take the guns first and worry about due process later, but the liberal black man gets all the blame and suspicion... 

Telling! 


932 2018-05-17 14:57:51 Stocks higher again. Nice numbers out of China. $BZUN making a nice move higher. We like all the ‘new’ companies in China. This is the Chinese Shopify. $shop
933 2018-05-17 14:56:30 The best thing I could’ve ever done was start investing in stocks. It’s finally paying off 
934 2018-05-17 14:56:08 True, but in reality investors care about something that looks more “traditional”. Also in reality stocks / bonds don’t have the same Sharpe. Bonds had a much > Sharpe over the last 30 years and have been a diversifier. Math to me makes that unlikely to continue from here.

937 2018-05-17 14:54:41 If I don’t feed my family foods full of processed fats and sugars am I starving them by taking away all their food? Of course not. I’m eliminating unnecessary dangerous foods but they still get food. 

Change processed fats and sugars to AR-15 and bump stocks. Common sense laws.

939 2018-05-17 14:54:10 Over the time, I've come to a realization that stocks in confirmed uptrend, holding their ground by correcting less in general market corrections are more likely to maintain stable & accelerated Earnings growth than those stocks which are in downtrend & struggling.

946 2018-05-17 14:52:14 question regarding risk parity: what if risk isn't measured correctly via standard deviation/covariance measures? risk parity on way out of the money put selling and stocks would have you 99% put selling 1% stock buying. Anyway, i like RP as a tool. but not perfect
947 2018-05-17 14:51:59 can we put the Ten year watch to bed. it was a media inspired false correlation. So is Oil etc. when there is appetite for risk stocks go up. its a bull mkt
948 2018-05-17 14:51:30 Jake - the fundamental assumption of risk parity is that the assets have the same ex ante Sharpe ratio. 

Risk parity makes no active "bets" on the relative excess performance of bonds.

It is mean-variance optimal if stocks, bonds, and other assets have similar Sharpe ratios.
949 2018-05-17 14:51:12 Yes offcourse..when stocks go up its always pump and dump for those missing out

986 2018-05-17 14:37:02 We’ve disagreed in the past (and I don’t expected this to change), but moving from GMP to risk parity is a huge bet on the excess performance of bonds... an area that has maybe a best case 0.2-0.3 Sharpe over the next 5-10 with (IMO) a likelihood of higher correlation to stocks

1062 2018-05-17 14:08:15 I usually like @LeeCamp but let’s be honest, he’s ignorant here. When describing “ponzi scheme” and gambling he’s actually describing growth stocks and trading and @kevinolearytv already told you that. Don’t want capital appreciation to bear your gains then go to dividend stocks

Trillions of dollars being lost is a Dem thing too. Record breaking employment and stocks is GOP thing.
1202 2018-05-17 13:23:14 t-bonds are 100% safe... no risk.

If stocks were about to tumble, investors getting the jitters, then they would be buying t-bonds even if the yield was 0.00001% 

More lightly, its was the end of QE in oct 2014 - QE was suppressing yields by pushing up the price of t-bonds
1203 2018-05-17 13:23:11 FMCG stocks like ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints and Pidilite declined 1-2% on account of profit booking.

1207 2018-05-17 13:21:53 Yes but you’ve been saying that since at least 2014 — which makes me think you stayed away from equities and received flat returns in Gold miners, at best.

You’re probably not even aware that’s a massive issue. Insider trading anyone? Stock Act is A LAW prohibiting exactly that by govt employees.

1254 2018-05-17 12:59:16 With the fiscal picture the worst in the history of the US, and the Fed having smashed the monetization taboo with QE, I wouldn't touch long bonds with a 10-foot pole. Best case, you get 0-2% real return. Worst case, you get your face ripped off. I'll take chances w/stocks & RE.
1255 2018-05-17 12:59:14 More often, we happen to panic when a downside happens in present or future. But tend to term the past downsides as huge opportunities to buy value stocks at affordable prices.
1256 2018-05-17 12:58:35 I endeavour to be the finest cheerleader for quality stocks, but the fiercest of critics for the garbage.

(that might make for a good tagline, if overly long).
1257 2018-05-17 12:58:18 So difficult  (and frustrating) trying to Short individual Stocks in a Bull Market - I guess hard to see the point anyway as going Long is biased your way from the off.

1260 2018-05-17 12:55:58 Bump stock is a separate attachment that’s sold separately. I agree that bump stocks shouldn’t be allowed. They’re stupid and a meme to make idiots feel like they’re in call of duty. And what’s a “safe limit” magazine if 30 is too much?
1261 2018-05-17 12:55:56 @KCURMichael Also, you said "big chicken stocks"
1262 2018-05-17 12:55:56 Morning Market Update: stocks are edging lower as bond yields rise and investors digest retail earnings.
1263 2018-05-17 12:55:23 Trust is what is important. We can't do this alone. In life, our word is our most important asset that we have. Picking stocks is the same. Find people you trust, we can't do this alone, and always keep your word. #otc2018

1273 2018-05-17 12:48:40 The Gozon's have little shares of stocks compared to the Yalung's, Jimenez's and Duavit's.  Bringing the network to bancruptcy is not new to them.  It was almost bankrupt in pre ALDUB days.  Intentionally and deliberately splitting ALDUB will bring them to where it belong.

1282 2018-05-17 12:44:14 Correct. And when you get down to the investable micro-cap space, they are even wider than for regular small-cap stocks.

1288 2018-05-17 12:42:12 The 10 year treasury note interest is still rising fast. This indicates lack of trust by investors in the economy, both bonds and stocks. Only store of value is crypto currency.  Get ready for the moon  shot. It’s going to be amazing.
1289 2018-05-17 12:42:03 Every minor bit of news such as a slight uptick in interest rates is met with a rather large, orchestrated selloff by liberal-leaning fund managers and their hierarchy, turning yet another shorting profit with the mass selling of many of their own client's stocks and funds.

1299 2018-05-17 12:36:09 Do Kenyan fishermen do more than fish? I want to eat Kenyan fish, but the fish stocks keep dropping without much intervention thus price goes up. L. Naivasha used to have periods of restocking & closure to allow growth till County govt did away with it to our detriment.
1300 2018-05-17 12:34:35 The Piccadilly Circus Boots is huge, so stocks brands that the smaller stores don't (may be worth looking at NYX if you go to a large Boots) . Covent Garden has a MAC and an Urban Decay. Would Screenface or Charles Fox in Covent Garden be open late enough?

1325 2018-05-17 12:25:38 I don't think they will ever detach per say, but rather indexed into sectors. At this point it's like saying when will stocks be detached from fiat. I guess we have to wait and see if fiat and bitcoin co-exist or if there's really a transitioning into a new world currency.

1426 2018-05-17 11:26:27 The problem with shorting the FAANG stocks is that you are shorting quasi-monopoly like companies with massive earnings power. You need a helping hand from regulators to make the short work. To me that's too risky.
1427 2018-05-17 11:26:08 Totally disagree, WB bought Washington Post,Amex against market sentiments & huge success, but those who bought IT stocks , infra stocks, by following market suffered huge losses, these are not exceptions but a rule.

1463 2018-05-17 10:49:55 Your stance on gun control doesn’t even advocate banning bump stocks or limiting ammo sales. It reads as more of the same.
1464 2018-05-17 10:48:45 They're not even proposing regulating bump stocks.

It's 100% ban.
Turn in your stocks to be destroyed or prison.

They didn't even do that with personal owned machine guns.

The real danger is not a plastic accessory.
The new law would open the door to more bans up to semi-autos

1466 2018-05-17 10:46:01 Only 3 times since 1929, stocks and bonds declined in tandem. The 1st was when a currency crisis forced UK to abandon the gold standard, the 2nd was the U.S. entry into the WW2. The 3rd was in 1969. Each one left a mark on lifetime charts. This will be the largest one
1467 2018-05-17 10:44:42 @iManasArora and @welcometotfs  have different views here. Let's wait for tomorrow which may give some confirmation. my personal view is index fall may be more than individual stocks. Overall breadth may be positive but Index maynot.

1514 2018-05-17 10:02:28 One of my largest holdings as there will be massive traffic on their PoA (PoS) platform. This will attract institutional and big bankroll investors that are used to stocks paying dividends. If their mainnet is successful and handles the traffic, skys the limit.
1515 2018-05-17 10:01:54 My strategy is mostly to play channels or trends, and look for reversals. I find stocks that show strong reversal signs - reversal patterns, or the price beginning to pop above the 50 day MA from below it, or where the 50 day Moving Average begins to turn upwards, etc.

1538 2018-05-17 09:48:12 let's not forget: for years it suited the US to give out their troops on hire and charge other countries for it. Kosovo was a particularly successful event that helped clear the stocks of old artillery......

1542 2018-05-17 09:44:46 Why does our instinct tell us to buy stocks when prices are high and to sell stocks when prices are low, and we are likely to sell or at the very least, not buy, when prices are low. Funny that!

1543 2018-05-17 09:43:33 Backwards.  The strategy was to to pretend to yield on the bump stocks on the condition they could get carry permits to be recognized by states that didn't have it.  That way they could appear to be anti bump stock but block with their "accessory" as you put it poison pill

1676 2018-05-17 07:07:11 My reading for these 3 stocks @IDFC_Bank @SintexPlastics_ and #SintexInd is that these have bottomed out at levels of 39-45, 48-55 and 16.50-18. Future prospects looks good for better returns.

Disclaimer: I am not an expert, hence, i can be horribly wrong.

As a trader: intra-day or momentum:
-keep looking at a few scrips only 
-develop a sense of volume-price movements in these stocks
-when price moves along with volumes, the trend is sustainable
-note volume peak out, sign to book out!

1934 2018-05-17 03:35:47 Your conclusion with zero facts supporting it is that stupid millenials are buying all of the cool stocks with zero regard for fundamentals. When in fact, millenials can't move markets, institutions run by 50 year old corporate stiffs are the ones buying these stocks at ATH.

1938 2018-05-17 03:30:49 True. But the issue is profiting directly vs indirectly. For example, being able to charge $200K for speaking appearances after being in office vs being able to directly influence the stock market with tweets/statements and short sell stocks

2044 2018-05-17 02:10:13 In stocks & currencies that my friend mentions, item of trade may be scammy, but at least you have a reliable ledger of what was traded. In blockchain trading, the ledger itself is the scam so everything traded on it is a scam trade that will ditch you. Question of when, not if.

2046 2018-05-17 02:09:31 Probably a lot, and Nixon & McConnell & many others have lined their pockets.

It’s wrong for Dems & wrong for GOP. Only in the last few years has it been illegal for Congress to trade stocks just before they change a bill.

Only term limits & stronger laws will stop corruption.

2087 2018-05-17 01:21:04 That probably depends on state laws and the know-how of the person doing the modifications.  A quick search shows that Slidefire is shutting down, and no bump stocks can be found on Amazon or Google.

2115 2018-05-17 01:01:18 I think we can all agree bump stocks should be banned, but a regular AR 15 with no bump stock absolutely cannot fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  Pat Davis is being deceitful in his campaign ad and that is wrong.
2116 2018-05-17 01:01:07 Nope but they banned bump stocks

2122 2018-05-17 00:55:18 Yes, I agree BUT as an investor that's an incredibly powerful nugget of information. 

By the time everyone figures out that 90% of cannabinoids are non-euphoric and they're all anti-inflammatory / therapeutic, the winning stocks will already be much higher.

How many more students & young people out having fun do you need slaughtered b4 we act? 1000? 10,000?

2130 2018-05-17 00:47:25 I’m newer to trading higher priced stocks and it’s been tough adjusting from small cap land. 40 cent moves used to be fairly large, now it’s, as you say, a “wiggle”
2131 2018-05-17 00:46:58 I don't know where you're getting your information but Delta hasn't lost any thing as a matter of fact there stocks have doubled and FedEx is taking a huge hit Dick's Sporting Goods also doing just fine
2132 2018-05-17 00:46:54 Well sure, it could go lower with no catalyst near term but that's why people who think their CD47 is the real deal will add on dips... Nobody in the world can perfectly time markets or stocks when it comes to buying... Add little at a time if it goes lower
2133 2018-05-17 00:46:15 In small cap developmental #Biotech, it takes the right science + investor patience. The turd stocks run up fast because they are TURDS that are pumped, then dumped to the 'suckers.'

2135 2018-05-17 00:46:02 Never understood why people would want to dabble in midcap and smallcap stocks in a market which has ALWAYS lacked both volumes and clarity. If at all u wish to try out speculation in such stocks, it should be via a flexicap fund!! Get it?

2137 2018-05-17 00:45:08 I don’t think anyone would be surprised that he owned stock when he became president.  Are you insinuating that he should tell his npbroker to just seize activities and let failing stocks plummet?

2166 2018-05-17 00:20:33 Wild stocks in decline from BC south to California. No salmon farms to blame in California and Oregon. One has to consider lack of food at sea when looking to Alaska's 60 billion hatchery releases.
2167 2018-05-17 00:20:27 does anyone else hear yannel orrrrrrr
2168 2018-05-17 00:19:57 Except if you track what has happened since those tax cuts is they spent almost all of it on BuyBacks for their stocks and payouts for their stockholders instead of it trickling down to anyone. They spent more than 50 times more on that than they did weight increase or bonuses.
2169 2018-05-17 00:19:51 $SPY The assumption is everyone bought the dip yesterday. More realistically, many people sold stocks lower. What you need is a better plan.
2170 2018-05-17 00:19:20 i bought off a local dad to ask u about stocks.

2172 2018-05-17 00:18:19 Trying to learn about stocks on my own 
2173 2018-05-17 00:17:59 Hi, yes the 2.1% move on that day was referring to Samsung's move. The stock's weighting is a separate calculation which also depends on the relative value of other stocks in the index
2174 2018-05-17 00:17:51 The state government wounded nine and killed four unarmed students. The weapons employed were a 1911 style pistol and a group of M1 garands. The rifles didn’t have pistol grips or adjustable stocks. They also only hold 8 rounds each. What is your point exactly?
2175 2018-05-17 00:16:57 The moment when I'm looking at a bill for a dentist whose services I may not be able to afford and in the waiting room, CNBC is on with aggressive   personalities talking about high octane stocks and bitcoin trends.  Stark contrast indeed.
2176 2018-05-17 00:16:55 I think u r mistaken, DemolitionDan. I never heard him say that, & I think his dad is a law abiding gun owner. It's clear there's a lotta love between them! I just looked thru David's Twitter & bump stocks are the only thing I saw him supporting a ban of. Y do u think this?
2177 2018-05-17 00:14:45 you know bump stocks have not made it possible to bump fire people have been bump firing ever since the semi auto has been made
2178 2018-05-17 00:12:55 Would not be surprised if the ECB managed to pull this off somehow through the back door. Buy stocks in printing press manufacturers!
2179 2018-05-17 00:11:25 I might sale my other stocks just to load $dirv.  All I see is stars exploding.
2180 2018-05-17 00:10:21 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2181 2018-05-17 00:08:13 Asia stocks begin positive as region takes cue from the rebound in US stocks as markets shrugged off rising US yields and data provided some encouragement; ASX 200 (+0.2%), Nikkei 225 (+0.5%), KOSPI (+0.4%)
2182 2018-05-17 00:07:20 @ElectMattDolan Vote for SB288! strengthen background checks, ban bump stocks, create ERPO laws. Keep my family and all of Ohio safe! Vote FOR SB288.
2183 2018-05-17 00:05:58 Well that was a pretty good time to sell US stocks
2184 2018-05-17 00:05:46 She was watching a different one than I was but she heard yanny while I heard laurel on that one still
2185 2018-05-17 00:05:32 Can our professor @timothysykes start pumping stocks from now on? It seems to work right away as soon as he opens his mouth stocks go up and tgere is a misterious squeeze such as $HEAR Thanks teacher for the lessons learned.
2186 2018-05-17 00:05:17 Macys tripled sales and consumer sales are up, this means people have more money. Healthy labor market=more jobs and stocks up, the Economy is booming.  The Democrats are loosing their footing, most just run on hate and obstruction. Is this really a winning platform?
2187 2018-05-17 00:04:32 Low pitch is Laurel, and high pitch is Yanny! I’ve heard Yanny all day but not I can differentiate between the 2 pitches and will heat both!
2188 2018-05-17 00:03:50 Same old song move it on land while everyone in truth knows it's not viable and there are a multitude of reasons wild stocks are endangered. Don't see these groups calling for a halt to transporting oil by rail car down the banks of the Fraser River do you.
2189 2018-05-17 00:02:52 Following your theory... This drives demand up which makes stocks go up... Which in turn... Aliens
2190 2018-05-17 00:01:57 Yanny!! But my mom just played it and I heard laurel and watched it 4 ones now I only hear yanny again
2191 2018-05-17 00:00:32 2 technology stocks plunged on Wednesday:
