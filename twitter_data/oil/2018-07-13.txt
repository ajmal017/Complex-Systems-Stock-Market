Like putting just half the contents of the flavoring packet in instant noodles, and using extra-virgin olive oil for frying bacon.
1 2018-07-14 23:59:27 Okay now that makes sense. To be honest that was 2014 and going in there would not have done the US any good but start a world war no issues asked.  The truth is the only reason the EU and US care is because of the Black Sea and it’s access to oil.

15 2018-07-14 23:57:07 I also decided to try the Sharpie oil pen, knowing it probably wouldn't be good, and it's not. The water one works much, much better. You have to try everything once or you never know.

34 2018-07-14 23:56:52 You put on beard oil to let your wife know you're feeling romantic, too? *lol* Teasin'.
35 2018-07-14 23:56:28 They should ask them to pinpoint countries which United States has invaded or where oil comes from.
36 2018-07-14 23:56:26 Moisturize it get some oil
37 2018-07-14 23:56:24 I will retweet when you swear off any oil product or byproduct for one year… Then ask me if you still want to get rid of the pipelines :-)

40 2018-07-14 23:56:07 @Annieslif While docs *may* know best, I decided 2 treat my minor medical issues w/ cannabis. Namely Cannabidiol or CBD Oil 4 short. Its legal in ALL 50 States becuz it's NOT Psychoactive. I'm getting *some* results w/out side effects. Oh BTW..CBD Oil Can't get U High, just Heal.
41 2018-07-14 23:55:30 I worked for one guy that used Rotella Hes rebuilt or completely replaced engines in every single truck he’s had, about 20 of them most of which only he drove My old boss only ever replaced 1 injector in a Detroit in 28 years and counting while using Schaefer’s oil on many drives
42 2018-07-14 23:55:21 Keto is a high in good fat way of eating. 70%healthy fats (avocado, coconut oil, full fat cheese, no cows milk, etc),20-25% protein and 5-10% carbs. No grain, sugar,  or gluten. I’ve been on for almost 2 mos and have never felt better.  Lost 23 lbs. Going out to eat is hard.
43 2018-07-14 23:55:20 I would imagine the gov will have to use oil/mining royalties to mitigate or default? What’s your thoughts?
44 2018-07-14 23:55:16 Oh so that makes it ok for you to have committed treason with Putin. No way your flock is ok with you making Russia great again! We see oil prices since you came into office!
45 2018-07-14 23:55:13 Vitamin E oil girl! Takes a while but really helps
46 2018-07-14 23:54:57 I agree time is now for that and real solutions on climate change.  A $$$ legal battle over a tax? Sask party has been given time to impl a real solution.  No one really wants a tax. But since Wall (in bed with oil) has done nothing and left it to Moe with this we have to act now
47 2018-07-14 23:54:56 Yes! Put Alexander Downer in the dock over #auspol attempts to steal East Timor’s oil! #insiders
48 2018-07-14 23:54:53 Yeah they be doing the most. I’m sorry you had that experience. I always be ready to fight. Especially because they know it’s hella extra. Like you know ain’t shit in here but some oil and leave in conditioner
49 2018-07-14 23:54:51 Nitro buggy racing was cancelled to this week due to low numbers and a wet/muddy track. Going to see what the track is like this afternoon, hopefully it's dry enough for some practice. Testing heavier shock oil, shorter tuned pipe and smaller carb venturi. #HobbiesOfInfosec
50 2018-07-14 23:54:41 Yup, that was the Globalist Elite's [lan all along, to take Syria and give to their puppet State Saudi Arabia for their own oil pipeline.
The Globalist used the Hillary/Obama regime's CIA to create ISIS as their Proxy Army in Syria.
And were succeeding until Russia came in.
51 2018-07-14 23:54:34 If you get the oil make sure it’s at least 1000 mg. I take 2 droppers full 2x a day.
52 2018-07-14 23:54:31 My boss just told me he's going to turn my guts into sashimi if I spill oil again lmaooo

Mr15 "Right now I smell of fries and taste fries oil in my mouth. I don't want to even think of Macca's fries right now".

56 2018-07-14 23:53:26 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
57 2018-07-14 23:53:14 If youre having some congestion or throat troubles, id recommend getting some very hot water, boiled probably, putting in a cup and adding lavender oil to it, and just breath that in for like 5 minutes. Its a little intense but opens things up for sure
58 2018-07-14 23:53:04 Handles are a bit trickier. Unless they are rat-tailed they need rivets, and rivets for handles are quirky. I don’t have the means to do that, quite apart from the question of shaping panels.

Belt sanders and knives don’t mix. Steel wool, crocus paper and oil.
59 2018-07-14 23:53:01 Put 5 strangers into the carriage of “an old diesel train, grimed with oil & soot” will they adopt a quincunx distribution to maintain their separation? #TRoS
60 2018-07-14 23:52:53 in the face of millions from oil and chemical companies it doesn't sway anyone except maybe towards his companies' interests, not the earth's. elon musk is rich but absolutely cannot compete with oil conglomerates. this is money that will support bad things happening, no question

64 2018-07-14 23:51:26 Innovating money from oil? Educate us on what innovation you’ve been behind that Democrats have hindered you.  Screwing the environment to make the mighty dollar don’t count.

67 2018-07-14 23:50:57 CA is still the only state that does not require an extraction fee from oil and gas companies. We're cutting emissions but those companies have a terrible hold on our state govt.
68 2018-07-14 23:50:35 Mike how are those kayaks made again?  How did the oil get there to Make them?  You are just like Horgan stop the oil, but give me oil
69 2018-07-14 23:50:22 ทักเดมไปแล้วนะคะ
70 2018-07-14 23:50:22 Yeah keep driving gas cars, big oil and big auto in Detroit doesn’t give money to the GOP. That’ll show em!
71 2018-07-14 23:50:09 If i will buy oil paint, i will need gamsol
So i’ll just buy a watercolour pad, i guess???
72 2018-07-14 23:49:55 Ive only tried their 100% coconut oil collection and argan oil deep conditioner. I heard some of their stuff now has bad chemicals but this collection was good. Which brand do you use?
73 2018-07-14 23:49:51 I love the realism of this post, a valuable corrective to some aspirational writing that sells a fantasy.

But what do you think is the most realistic (non-snake oil) discussion for the opposite POV? Have you seen any?
74 2018-07-14 23:49:35 How do you think your kayak is made?
Oil? That’s right. And how did it get there.
75 2018-07-14 23:49:28 Where did you go to school?   Who takes millions from the unions who take millions from their members and the government to line the pockets of their Dem friends.  That by the way is drying up. They will need to earn it the old-fashioned way like oil and gas.
76 2018-07-14 23:49:28 Get new sources pal or stop takin the oil money to spread propaganda simples 
77 2018-07-14 23:49:15 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
78 2018-07-14 23:49:08 Remember when oil was at 150/barrel?
Russia, Venezuela flexed their muscles
Suddenly they were rich!
Saudi stepped in to drop oil below $100 which effectively killed Russian economy, they couldnt balance their budget.
Cheap oil hurts oil producers, but Saudi did that to aid US
79 2018-07-14 23:48:52 Oh delicious I love it with the grated cheese and olive oil and fresh garlic I'm out of the cheese and olive oil so just went with the butter and garlic today
80 2018-07-14 23:48:45 Get out of your kayak made from oil and swim
81 2018-07-14 23:48:18 Floor prices bc NYCFC hasn’t connected with NYC. MLS got super excited and allowed huge Middle East oil money to buy a team instead of finding local owners. MLS needs local, engaged owners plus an accessible stadium location & good facility. Few clubs have all these.
82 2018-07-14 23:48:17 You guys are all like Horgan. Stop the oil but give me oil to make my kayak....
83 2018-07-14 23:48:00 Hmmmm, what about walnut oil or baby oil?
84 2018-07-14 23:47:54 my dude what the hell kind of car do you drive when you need to change the oil every 3 months
85 2018-07-14 23:47:54 My coconut oil spilled over

99 2018-07-14 23:45:00 Petrol prices depend on TWO things:
1) International oil price. 2) govt taxes
In UK & Australia that tax is called EXCISE DUTY
UK motorist pays US$2.90 per gallon in tax
US$6.43 per gallon total.
Net of tax, the petrol costs $3.53 per gallon
Petrol in Saudi is subsidised by govt.
100 2018-07-14 23:44:32 That and he forgot that Big Oil want to crush his shitty car company.
101 2018-07-14 23:44:27 the mechanics where i get the oil change for my car are fairly average looking but i still love it when they check me out.
102 2018-07-14 23:44:23 baby oil bisa dijadiin oil cleanser
103 2018-07-14 23:44:09 Recreate the Soviet. Destabalizing the Middle East and Africa. Control of global oil destruction of OPEC. Standing with China as the two super powers. Both Communist states which will show the futilit of liberal democracy as a world order.
104 2018-07-14 23:43:58 Which, once again, means you know nothing about Houston. And thinking oil is going away in the next 50 years is hysterical!!

108 2018-07-14 23:43:42 #insiders. When coal, gas and eventually oil are rejected by markets many powerful people lose reliable income stream. Why does Canavan continue the carbon fantasy? He needs to show carbon businesses how to transition. But they will lose their cash cows.
109 2018-07-14 23:43:23 I'm not well enough versed to state if it would be constitutional or not to restrict private companies from the sale of oil on the world market. Possibly in a national emergency. I'll definitely look into it.
110 2018-07-14 23:43:22 That’s some real shitty oil. Terrible shit.
111 2018-07-14 23:43:15 But the king was giving him gold... Lots of it. Also he needs him to pump more oil, to get him out of trouble. The only thing the Queen gave him, was tea.
112 2018-07-14 23:42:51 Let's put him as the whole Shitler regime in prison for life, and make the work cleaning up toxic waste and oil spills to earn their gruel.

It involves a bacteria which infects and destroys all the oil in the world. It could be a bigger hit than Volcano. The author is John Varley. Do you know any producers

124 2018-07-14 23:41:03 You may want to look into CBD oil (currently non-THC containing) and possibly edibles when they become available.

126 2018-07-14 23:40:48 Obama did something about it; he closed down two Russian spy compounds, expelled diplomats and rightly screwed your former Secretary of States $500B oil deal with Russia.

You tried to form a cyber unit with Putin, didn’t you?

128 2018-07-14 23:40:42 The oil is what every country needs but it is the fact that nations need oil and they need dollars to buy said oil that gives the high value to the dollar if this stops the mass of dollars

144 2018-07-14 23:39:33 Can you imagine the price of oil without our resurgence??
145 2018-07-14 23:39:32 Checked in bc of your rug Tweet & hope you catch this. I'll post in on your other one, too: rub clove oil on your forehead & sniff it every 10 minutes or so (be VERY careful not to get it in your eyes!) You can get it anywhere, but I usually get organic for my grandson's teething
146 2018-07-14 23:39:26 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.

150 2018-07-14 23:38:37 It's not even debate, just waste throwing oil into the fire and waste looking for ways to hate LGBTQ people so they want to pin this too.

157 2018-07-14 23:36:59 Almost like a raccoon caught in a bird trap with one leg stuck is the feeling of an oil company under siege by CSOs on payment  nondisclosure; zero human rights record + shady deals even after hefty govt tax concessions. @Oxfam, @NRGInstitute @Global_Witness are watching...
158 2018-07-14 23:36:45 Keep in mind on July 27th 2016 Trump looked into the tv camera and asked Russia to find HRC emails. Trump and Putin are working together and the #CULT45 zombies are clueless!!!. #DonTheCon is a snake oil salesman and conservatives are buying the snake oil.

166 2018-07-14 23:35:28 We got the EasyFreezy keto meals for the month of July.  Don't waste your money. Got a brown paper sack full of "meals" which was just oil/sauce/seasoning to add to your protein and sides.   #EasyFreezy
167 2018-07-14 23:34:58 @seemacnbc Nations have made economic trade offs that damage environment and human conditions for monetary gains. Despite the need to advance India-US relations, it is in the best interests of the Indian market to ignore US sanctions on Iranian Oil.
168 2018-07-14 23:34:53 It's the Texas auto lobby, not oil and gas.

170 2018-07-14 23:34:38 Totally. Its called free market capitalism. Now communist russia in the past restricted oil exports. If US Govt want to draft a bill banning export of US oil, it would upset many people. Bush, Cheney were oil men.
171 2018-07-14 23:34:38 bought dr.belmeur's ampoule for rm125, sampai rumah perasan dia ada tea tree oil. takutnya kalau naik jerawat. kenapa la tak terfikir nak beli eucerin serummmmm. mengaapaaaaa

So US rivalling with CHN ... wants to weaken RU and EU ...
174 2018-07-14 23:34:24 True. I usually sub butter for shortening and coconut oil for veggie oil.
175 2018-07-14 23:34:07 Dinner tonight: sautéed Italian sausage and onions mixed with a parsley-pine nut pesto, pasta and a bit too much olive oil. Man, it was good.

181 2018-07-14 23:32:36 Why do we export good oil and take in bad oil. Everyone wants our oil ask Europe.
182 2018-07-14 23:32:33 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America

187 2018-07-14 23:31:28 The reason we are not is because of the Big Oil in the states.
188 2018-07-14 23:31:27 Cleansing oil nya boleh pake minyak zaitun ngga? Atau diganti pake micellar water boleh ngga?
189 2018-07-14 23:31:21 Oil is sold on internation markets. Which means unless you believe in communism, petrol (gas) prices depend on market price for oil, not where is it drilled from. Private companies extract, refine & sell oil. They sell to the highest bidders.

205 2018-07-14 23:28:20 Much as physics jokes about chemistry being a subset, it's like trying to use chemistry to judge the relative merits of two oil paintings.

211 2018-07-14 23:27:51 Using nontoxic solvent-free mediums for my oil paints and I still feel woozy and have a headache after only a short while painting. Reading online it seems I could have a sensitivity to linseed oil. Anyone have any ideas? Suggestions?
212 2018-07-14 23:27:44 Yes. But the markets are fixed. If they let the Bond Market drop naturally the entire global economy would collapse. 

Watch Ruling Elite comments. They'll say stuff like, "crash coming" or raise oil prices or such. This crashes the US economy. Then dollar gets ditched.

226 2018-07-14 23:24:39 Thank you. The ridiculous and sanctimonious press needs to be made aware that we normal Americans are sick of their tantrums and at their continuous attempts to take down President Trump.
227 2018-07-14 23:24:24 Yes, do you realize the US imports crude oil from Russia as well?
228 2018-07-14 23:24:21 They currently occupy about 25% of Syria and a very significant sector of our oil and gas production. They are actually in a very strong position to make demands, it's great that they limited their demands to just this simple one.

236 2018-07-14 23:23:16 Yes, English chips are undercooked in too-cold oil and are thus sadly limp, greasy, pale objects.  Deep-fried potato strips probably originated in Belgium, but most of the world knows them as (French) fries, chips, or frites.

238 2018-07-14 23:22:45 I understand you praise Merkel, being a Communist; but why do you approve of the EU gaining Oil & Gas f/ Russia, when Russia is what NATO is defending against? Since they are shutting down their nuclear plants, is it not better to deal directly with the US for its energy needs?
239 2018-07-14 23:22:41 Oil seed rape? What is the crop on the right please?
240 2018-07-14 23:22:40 You make a valid point about climate change, but not very smart to try and stifle an industry pioneer of electric cars that make significant progress against the oil industry.  Teslas are amazing vehicles and ICE cars are more prone to catch fire. Disappointed by your rxn.

284 2018-07-14 23:15:07 USA is only interested in Sudan’s oil not human rights. 

What about all the US bombs falling on Yemen? Where is the concern?

Use peppermint oil, apparently makes your lips bigger. It works like a natural lip pumper. What I suggest doing is taking the peppermint Oil and put it in a lip gloss capsule and put it on as lip gloss.

290 2018-07-14 23:14:03 Oil is a great investment... for those who can afford it. Why is take home earnings not commensurate to these surges in corporate profits?
291 2018-07-14 23:13:42 Did You Know:

The US is about to become the largest exporter of crude oil in the world 

The Russian economy is entirely based on natural resources 

This is the last thing Putin would ever want

Sorry, Russia Truthers

297 2018-07-14 23:13:00 The U.S. has moved to majority home sourced oil...Like a few years ago. We don't need to buy much from elsewhere.

U.S. conflict in the Middle East has spiked oil prices many times.

Part of the national debt is TRILLIONS spent on adventurist wars.

You aren't makin' sense to me.

301 2018-07-14 23:12:34 The muscles on my legs had been playing up late last week. They were super tight. I ended up using a tiger balm oil and massaging them to shift the lactic avid and release the knots. It wasn’t pleasant but it worked a treat.

305 2018-07-14 23:11:50 ==The USA can continue  providing the world's reserve currency USD (= trade of oil & goods done in USD

OR USA can decide to relinquish that role & thus can get rid of the trade deficit
306 2018-07-14 23:11:37 What about the oil USA buy from Russia?

315 2018-07-14 23:10:26 My guess is that any changes that happen to those come more from the low BG & insulin, rather than the presence of small amounts of fat. Even if pure fat does affect insulin, it would be very minimally. (Assuming not glugging down a cup of oil.)  Just speculating here though.

321 2018-07-14 23:09:08 That explains everything.  Musk is in league with the Koch Brothers and going for the long con.  By churning out low quality cars, he's tarnishing the reputation for EV's so that the tech falls out of of favor and people remain reliant upon big oil!

324 2018-07-14 23:08:35 Scrub it clean with steel wool. Use a little ammonia. Once it's clean, cover it with a thin film of bacon grease or flax seed oil. Remove as much of it as you can with a lint-free cloth. Bake at 450 until it smokes. Repeat oiling and baking 2-3 more times.

B: "I threw away every product I own, 2 drops of coconut oil and drinking water will clear your skin permanently"
335 2018-07-14 23:06:52 That looks wonderful! Great idea to use zucchini. I love sesame oil. Such an earthy flavor. Thanks for the suggestion.

341 2018-07-14 23:05:20 Omg story of my life lmfao have you tried rose oil??? It's really good for your skin 
342 2018-07-14 23:05:18 Exactly! And corporate welfare. Maybe stop the oil gas subsidies too.
343 2018-07-14 23:04:49 that olive oil is only good for rubbing on foreheads in black churches
344 2018-07-14 23:04:48 "oil" and "gas" are two different commodities, and the markets for each commodity can be extremely different. The markets for each can also be subjected to substantially different fundamental forces. Rarely are they correlated.

349 2018-07-14 23:03:43 Absolutely fantastic tip on avoiding mosquito bites!!!

I’m v. allergic to mosquitoes. My doctor said to use an oil based lotion or sunscreen - mosquitos can’t get their proboscis through the oil.

I use Vaseline body lotion under sunscreen and have zero bites. 10/10 recommend
350 2018-07-14 23:03:33 Not an economic expert but I do know that oil in the ground has no value. Labor digs wells with machinery built by labor, sends crude via pipeline built by labor to refinery built & run by labor.Then trucked by labor to gas stations staffed by labor. They make the value imo.
351 2018-07-14 23:03:01 Fried some in olive oil yesterday no breading though
352 2018-07-14 23:02:51 May the holy living waters of jesus christ wash all witchcraft in her heart and may the anointed oil drawn the goat in her head. in jesus name i pray. ,
353 2018-07-14 23:02:47 They believe in climate change. They aren’t stupid. But donations from oil companies help persuade them to take an anti climate position. Elon’s donations help bring them back
354 2018-07-14 23:02:45 They started charging luggage fees when price of oil went up and they never stop after prices return back to normal. They decided to keep the money and screw everybody else, including their own employees
355 2018-07-14 23:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

357 2018-07-14 23:02:19 Most people, fry chips in a kettle of oil.  Best when deep fried in bacon grease, though entirely unhealthy.
Alternatively, oven bake chips for that.soulless taste experience.
358 2018-07-14 23:02:13 80 bucks for an oil change 
359 2018-07-14 23:02:13 Obasanjo started and Jonathan couldn't complete  in 8 years but buhari completed it in 3 years. Common bro 16 years of 85% during oil boom and 15% completed during receesion
360 2018-07-14 23:02:09 Okay so lesson learnt DONT PUT WATER INTO A FRYING PAN WITH OIL INIT
361 2018-07-14 23:02:05 Load them up with some oil from Alverta. Lock them up.
362 2018-07-14 23:02:02 I’ve reached a point in my life where I’ve switched to synthetic oil. I think that means it’s time to slow down and start a family now or something
363 2018-07-14 23:02:01 The only thing that gives the US dollar any value is that people need 2 have it 2 buy oil from OPEC countries and in exchange for this the USA will "war for hire" to these countries enemies , if they don't do this people will see hyperinflation due 2 the 21trl in debt
364 2018-07-14 23:02:00 The world’s oldest person once attributed her ripe old age (122) to a diet of olive oil, port wine and 1kg of chocolate per week. What an idol! 
365 2018-07-14 23:01:57 だったからかなぁ？？（笑）
366 2018-07-14 23:00:48 True, but we could be doing a lot more. We need to end all emissions ASAP. We need to make cleaner cars and solar power accessible for low-income folks. And we need to implement an oil extraction or severance tax as many other states do to capture more of that wealth.
367 2018-07-14 23:00:48 Yo capaz voy,pero me pareció ocurrente publicar eso,el gas oil en Victoria ya está a $39 el litro... mamita

370 2018-07-14 23:00:38 Why you haven’t made public your tax returns? How much money are you beholden to Putin for? He controls oligarchs. In exchange for tearing down EPA standards, denying climate change, pissing off NATO & EU, etc. so you can get the $500Billion share of the arctic oil drilling?

375 2018-07-14 22:59:31 And we know that, that is why we are slowly proceeding to other areas where we dont have to depend on oil too much.. we are still learning and growing to improve so be patient with us kay

386 2018-07-14 22:57:16 That's great news. Now we need some price control. Stop these oil companies from gouging us. Maybe taking it off the commodities market? Since we have so much here, we shouldn't be paying near $3.00 a gallon.
387 2018-07-14 22:57:12 See who is referring to as oil money club. Before the Arabs bought your club and their ridiculous spending, what history does Man City have

390 2018-07-14 22:56:49 Think I got it all in a couple of tweets. U3O8 itself is a small part of making a fuel assembly and they are a small part of operations budgets. That's what makes nuclear power insensitive to fuel price. Cost of U3O8 almost does not matter. Not so for coal/oil/gas.

398 2018-07-14 22:55:27 Imagine the cost of an oil change here if it were mandated that it be covered by insurance. This is where my ideas on less insurance involvement for certain inexpensive services and products come into play.

401 2018-07-14 22:55:03 The oil in that soup almost changed the location of my heart
402 2018-07-14 22:54:59 Then there's revenue when oil is exported without  coming onto land and never credited to Scotland + the 6000 square miles with a few oil wells annexed to England in 1997. Scotland is financially viable without oil & gas but there's pocket money offshore that might come in handy.
403 2018-07-14 22:54:46  lmao foreign whip; gas tank on E, way pst due for an oil change and tune up. Car breaks down on the freeway and the got no insurance or reg so they cant hit AAA
404 2018-07-14 22:54:34 Irrespective of name, it's just an analysis workshop. It's a trivial amount of project lifecycle time, and is barely useful once no longer an absolute beginner.

408 2018-07-14 22:54:15 Oh really my question is what the hell was doing was it a back room deal about an oil field that got the shooting started why was she there in such secrecy anyway did bill sell the public out on highways safety?

410 2018-07-14 22:53:56 AND TO DUBAI & THE OTHERS OOZING IN OIL RICHES,HOW MUCH EXCESS WILL YOU FLAUNT IN THE FACES OF THE POOR?Whose planet is this? There are no names on these resources & therefore they need to be more fairly shared across the globe.This distribution of resources is absolutely unjust.
411 2018-07-14 22:53:54 I can’t find the charger for my oil pen and I just might die
412 2018-07-14 22:53:48 If you wearing a hat that wanna keep “perfect” probably not best idea to wear it doing oil changes, etc. Have separate hats for stuff like that
413 2018-07-14 22:53:00 There is nothing more annoying than putting a little coconut oil in your hair after a shower, but not realizing that a little is actually too much so when your hair dries, it’s oily  NOW I HAVE TO WASH IT ALL OVER AGAIN
414 2018-07-14 22:53:00 Most of us perform regular maintenance on our vehicles… oil changes, fluid top-up, tire rotations… to keep our cars running well. We need to apply this preventative maintenance to our bodies as well.

417 2018-07-14 22:52:42 In the old days one actually had gauges in the car to let you know something wasn’t right.  For example battery gauge to see if it was charging correctly, oil pressure gauge.
418 2018-07-14 22:52:38 Cut subsidies to oil companies....if they make billions in profit, they dont need tax subsidies to stay in business

420 2018-07-14 22:52:28 Yes, that too. The only reason your face feels less oily is because you’re dehydrating it. Temporarily, it works to balance oil. In the long run it makes it 10x worse.
421 2018-07-14 22:52:13 Try Josie Marian Argon oil body spray in Vanilla Apricot.... it’s heaven!!
422 2018-07-14 22:51:43 Sadly not got tickets for GM this year so won’t see you pass me in torrential rain in an oil skin!
423 2018-07-14 22:51:40 Tas muy caro fuel oil
424 2018-07-14 22:51:36 If the alternative was that Tesla went bankrupt because the government took away incentives for electric vehicles overnight then big oil wins. Can people not see past the party or how this achieves a greater good?
425 2018-07-14 22:51:35 NASA I get, but how is cutting funding for coal mines and oil rigs, and investing instead in clean energy, bad?
426 2018-07-14 22:51:27 I had this happen once. I went to check my oil and a copper head was laying on my motor.

429 2018-07-14 22:50:54 Dear Michael...

Let's face the facts and the cold hard truth for just a moment. You, nor anybody else in the United States has the power to unite anyone or anything as long as @realDonaldTrump is occupying the White House. Uniting water with oil would be a hell of a lot easier!
430 2018-07-14 22:50:06 Preparing for another practice run to Catalina oil change and inspection great pit stop at Prime 
431 2018-07-14 22:50:01 My dad (not religious) asked my husband if he has that “holy oil”, and my husband showed him his keychain thing and my dad said “YOU GOT A VILE OF IT??? FOR VAMPIRES OR WHAT”
432 2018-07-14 22:49:38 Pepper, salt, hot sauce, olive oil, white vinegar, and cook it on butter. Now we're talking!
433 2018-07-14 22:49:35 Hi! Micellar waterproof is a bi-phase cleanser which appears as a separate phase on top. Our formula is oil free! Just shake well and apply !
434 2018-07-14 22:49:28 That’s no doubt true, but The Teslarian’s are about a shared vision of the future. Us vs Them (Big Oil/Koch Brothers/Hedge Funds) is a crucial part of the $TSLA narrative (God knows it’s not about results). But personal betrayal to the “cause” is the worst offense of all.

436 2018-07-14 22:48:53 Just changed my own damn oil because couldn't stand the blinking light telling me to change it. Thought changing it would make it stop. IT DIDN'T. One Google search and 2 buttons later, I made it stop. Lesson learned: Google to find the cheat BEFORE I spend $$.
437 2018-07-14 22:48:29 I get my nails done every week and a half because they don’t last. Today I was told that my nails produce too much oil and nothing will last.
438 2018-07-14 22:47:52 Umm maybe bathroom products in black bottles?  Beard oil? Lawn mowers?  Vapes?  Spicy food?  Dude ranches?  Growth products?
439 2018-07-14 22:47:49 The 1970s oil crisis happened. They sold europe to the ME, they ramped that up 1995 Barcelona agreement
440 2018-07-14 22:47:46 Do you do stuff like change the oil In your car? Or other stuff that gets your hands dirty?
441 2018-07-14 22:47:43 Go get 'em Rico! We are pulling for you!!!!
442 2018-07-14 22:47:30 Because it takes up more time by more people, frequently after-hours (worst case, hospitalisation), and requires more expensive treatments (esp if you've damaged your lungs).

As an analogy: cost of keeping the oil topped up in your car < cost of having to replace your engine.

Dry, stilted, and misspelled prose made up every bone in Vincenzo's body . When words failed him--and they often did--he turned to beard oil.

He expressed desire for his wife with a shiny beard. Love making always smelled of sassafras and vanilla.

447 2018-07-14 22:46:25 Shouldn't have left the oil everywhere in this heat
448 2018-07-14 22:46:22 Yeap, scientists can be biased indeed, same as politicians and oil execs. The cool thing about science though is that opinions dont matter. The only thing that matters is DATA, observations, and reproducibility. Anybody can get the data themselves and come to the same conclusion
449 2018-07-14 22:46:13 /Yeah, you got that right.

452 2018-07-14 22:45:58 Long before you were born .When you pulled up to a gas station a guy would come running out pump your gas ,clean your windshield ,check your oil ,and check your tire pressure if you asked .I remember when Gas was .32 cents a gallon

454 2018-07-14 22:45:37 What has been developed is an extract of cannabis, which does not contain the ingredient of marijuana that makes one feel high. So you can't become even a little bit "addicted" taking the cannabis oil that is being sold - it's expensive. Not sure Texas even approves of that.
455 2018-07-14 22:45:20 Wait just a minute. Let’s not diss pasta and ketchup just yet. My dearly departed mother used to take cold pasta and fry it in olive oil, a smidge of onion and ketchup. You’ve never eaten anything like it. Delish!

460 2018-07-14 22:44:17 Globalist can't cause GENOCIDE and steal OIL and Gas, slavery, human trafficking and promotion of jihadists if there is PEACE across the World . PEACE=death to Globalist. I say take their free Fund...recognize Hebrew Biafra.
461 2018-07-14 22:44:16 I respect that you served - so why is there this hate?  Look at Iraq.  WMD's - or oil & deals for Haliburton  ?  The decisions on where the US puts their forces or money is always strategic - buy the politicians - screw the locals. How to change that pattern? Not more $ or bombs.

For the first time in 60 years America is importing oil again, tax cuts and deregulation has created the lowest unemployment in our history,
Company’s are come back creating jobs

475 2018-07-14 22:42:42 You want the company forcing the world to take electric cars seriously to lose money? Why? So big oil can continue polluting. Nice one.
476 2018-07-14 22:42:41 It doesn't come with anointing oil, ma'am.
477 2018-07-14 22:42:40 Trump had no money. The party is its “genetically ordained” rich-ass donor class who think it would be groovy to have a new white supremacist, dominionist empire, freeing them to extract & pollute cash and oil and orphans at will, enforced by disinformation, creepy IT, & thugs.

486 2018-07-14 22:41:40 I do not get you. You express your hate to EM and Tesla so much bc he donated to RP as to others. But I bet that you are buying gas/oil or driving ICE car and therefore you are giving money to Koch Brothers & other Oil Co., which are the biggest donors to GOP SuperPack.
487 2018-07-14 22:41:40 Thanks for the report Peter. Make sure you eat fish oil or something restorative after that.

491 2018-07-14 22:41:20 Food is mood and with natural oil, butter, milk and cream and vegetables (bacterially rich unprocessed foods) we can reverse what is cognitive decline.

 A high sugar diet and bacterially poor  food sources are at the heart of it.
492 2018-07-14 22:41:13 So I use all forms. Gummies, oil, crystals. I have zero desire to drink and I was struggling and in bad shape 2 months ago. Take it everyday for a month and you’ll notice a huge difference. I’ll never stop taking it.

504 2018-07-14 22:39:32 “We will cast the orphaned puppies out into the cold and ensure the local children have no safe place to gather. Then we can build oil wells and spoil the environment forever! Bwahahaha.” Or something like that.
505 2018-07-14 22:39:20 Now actually while some of that may be stored solar energy, the rest is stored geothermal energy. Oil is abiotic in origin at least partly. Otherwise you couldn't find it more than a mile underground -- all remains of life stop there. It's been found 8 miles deep.

509 2018-07-14 22:38:57 Very petrol-driven though - and you do have oil and gas but it mostly seems to be in the West and  offshore and I can't see gangs of Mad Max barbarians running extraction and refining in either deserts or the ocean. 

However there are inland wells in S. Victoria so maybe there?

518 2018-07-14 22:38:15 @realDonaldTrump 

Putin needs to be schooled on what real power is...economic power.

Russia has almost 4 times the population of California but has almost half the GDP.

California has such a high powered economy they can afford to not tap their oil reserves. Guns or butter?
519 2018-07-14 22:38:05 Agreed, but the Squeaky wheel usually gets the oil. Djokovic is the Lendl of this generation. Phenomenal player, but for whatever reason - tough to like or cheer for.

527 2018-07-14 22:35:57 People shouldn't forget to factor our population into narratives like this.

Norway with a pop. of about 5Million, according to that tweet produce about half the oil we do.

Nigeria has about 200M people, even with all the mass murders.

We're corrupt, yes, but also overpopulated
528 2018-07-14 22:35:36 Now dumbfucks are saying we need to pray for the naira to gain on the dollar. What the fuck do they think I can do about it? If only they could start exporting anointing oil instead of crude oil....

530 2018-07-14 22:35:16 You obviously have your head somewhere but in the real world. You must not have investments to watch grow, see business booming in the oil/gas fields, etc. Typical lib attitude.
531 2018-07-14 22:34:53 we also have all the oil and gas we stole from timor-leste but don't mention ot or it's 25 years inside

545 2018-07-14 22:32:13 Lmao. NATO is spineless. We would have to go it alone. Russia doesn’t have to invade Germany. All they have to do is cut off their oil supply and watch their economy and energy implode thanks to Merkel’s shady dealings.
546 2018-07-14 22:31:56 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
547 2018-07-14 22:31:55 Went to get my oil changed and these guys are like “you need oil, new backlights, new ac vent,  new tires, and . . . pretty much a new car”
548 2018-07-14 22:31:27 Ya think?
549 2018-07-14 22:31:27 You probably going to have to change the oil and get a tune up.

551 2018-07-14 22:31:01 There is something wrong.  The fact these ppl can get subsidies in the first place. This is what economists call a market distortion.

565 2018-07-14 22:29:23 I saw the excuse “for reduce carbon emissions & reflect harmful UV to heal ozone” THATS BULLSH*T simply because humanity has the knowledge of free clean energy, water, wind, solar! Leaders also need to stop fighting over this oil. #illogical

571 2018-07-14 22:28:11 And I often wonder how much grease resides on Jacob's slicked back hair. Forget the Saudis, I think we got enough oil up there to carry us through for the next few years!

575 2018-07-14 22:27:12 is there an essential oil or stupid home remedy that will magically make me happy?
576 2018-07-14 22:27:11 Yeah it could also vary by the brand of the actual cartridges. I get the sense though that since they are all identical, they order the parts from the same place and just fill them with their brand of oil?
577 2018-07-14 22:27:08 I made collard greens w/Olive oil & chicken broth & I doubt if I ever use meat again! #Delish!
578 2018-07-14 22:27:07 Have you ever asked yourself why the EU didn't sign the trade agreement despite the PC govs hard work? Why the oil patch CEOs stood behind Notly on the stage when the carbon tax was announced? Why the CEO of
579 2018-07-14 22:26:59 You realize Russia is a breakthakingly corrupt middle income country with a shaky economy that does nothing but sell oil and overspend on sports? The idea they control American politics is just sour grapes.

586 2018-07-14 22:25:10 The last time I was in Cleveland was because a friend had his bachelor party there (as one does). We went to an "Italian restaurant" for dinner. When asked for oil and vinegar, they brought out white vinegar and canola.

Ok but this is actually David and I, not Ove and his wife
588 2018-07-14 22:25:01 No problem! Yes, they are cannabis oil vape cartridges. Right now there are three main types of pens with different form factors of cartridges.
589 2018-07-14 22:24:53 of all the things for my hair to love, salt water? But we hate every kinda oil? Every curly product line? BUT SALT WATER?
590 2018-07-14 22:24:53 This is about as stupid as the bullshit that Cowherd spills out on his show. You are comparing a no-salary cap system with a player who was playing pro at 17 on a team that is funded by Middle Eastern oil to US athletes freshly entering leagues on rookie contracts.
591 2018-07-14 22:24:38 That’s a political decision . That’s like saying cancer isn’t a disease because there is no cure . For the love of God they can’t even get it straight if coffee or eggs are good or bad for you. Now fish oil
592 2018-07-14 22:24:36 We recently started a original sin 1 campaign, first thing he does is throw and oil barrel next to me while I'm on fire
593 2018-07-14 22:24:34 I'm not surprised with all the hard work you've done on Corrie. Get some soluble vit c & zinc and cod liver oil tablets. In a few days of taking these you'll feel much better! Nothing worse than a summer cold when it's hot weather. Get well soon

598 2018-07-14 22:23:52 Come out with it Bernie. You want government to run all these companies just like healthcare.

601 2018-07-14 22:23:35 And whom would blame her, the slime oil from that snake must have been just disgusting. And the smell. Bless her Majesty for keeping up the Tradition of meeting the US President. But seriously, is it not that this may be the last one Her Majesty, God Save Our Queen, may meet?
602 2018-07-14 22:23:34 Weird because I’m pretty sure CAT says use CAT oil, which I believe, don’t hold me to this, is Delvac...

615 2018-07-14 22:21:36 This is heartbreaking tragedy, we have to do better by our Vets , suicide is epidemic among our Vets, we have to help and heal those suffering and STOP sending these beautiful young people into needless oil wars

618 2018-07-14 22:21:25 Sanctioning Iran, an ally of Russia is playing into Putin's hand? Killing hundreds of Russian mercenaries is doing the bidding of Putin? 
Calling out Germany buying billions in gas from their worst enemy, Putin tell Trump to do this?

620 2018-07-14 22:21:01 Well when everything does all go tits up and the oil tankers stop arriving at least you'll still have operational coal mines and coal-fired power stations and so be able to maintain some sort of weird steampunk civilisation. 

We in the mother country OTOH are all going to die...

629 2018-07-14 22:20:21 Exactly. The whole mess in Ukraine is about the US gov't wanting to get access to the oil & gas deposits in the Blk sea. Hunter Biden sat on an energy commission based in Kiev.
630 2018-07-14 22:20:11 ...so hey mister”the best words,” Why so we buy oil from Saudi Arabia! You know , the 911 hijackers
631 2018-07-14 22:19:53 This is what happens when you put your trust in a snake oil salesman.   I am really hard pressed to give you any compassion
632 2018-07-14 22:19:44 and contains palm oil, so rainforest/orangutan habitat destroyers as well
633 2018-07-14 22:19:40 I love The Ordinary. Although I feel so, so tired I now do not look it! I love their Rosehip Oil. If you want brightening it is all about moisture, plus I use Nip and Fab's glycolic range (very good for brightening up tired skin)!
634 2018-07-14 22:19:36 I need them oil papers things
635 2018-07-14 22:19:28 Key to a happy toddler: mix mashed potatoes with coconut oil and peas and corn.
636 2018-07-14 22:19:22 Vancouverites prefer their oil be produced in dictatorships by enslaved foreign workers, and then shipped across the planet. Ethical oil is not Un-Canadian.
637 2018-07-14 22:19:21 I miss eating roasted yam with palm oil
638 2018-07-14 22:19:07 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?

641 2018-07-14 22:18:23 And we use Russian oil also.
642 2018-07-14 22:18:19 Correct. Germany is not paying Russia for military use but for supporting with gas. This is business, nothing else. POTUS wants us to support his producing oil from stone. NUTS! Gas from Russia is better deal!  POTUS lost!
643 2018-07-14 22:18:11 The delusional leading the disillusioned. This is what a modern day snake oil salesman looks and sounds like. Unfortunately, our country’s national security, democracy, and economy are at stake. A man w/a string of business failures & debt he doesn’t want anyone to see.

645 2018-07-14 22:18:02 Keep in mind, Russia's economy is HEAVILY dependent on oil production. We are exporting oil now. Trump criticized Germany, NATO for using Russian oil. 

Russia is aligning with Iran over oil. 

But we can easily control them both by restricting their sales. 
Germany was stupid.
646 2018-07-14 22:17:57 Salt spray, less shampooing, more conditioning (olive oil based are really good)
647 2018-07-14 22:17:54 And when you get your new truck like I know you are gonna buy, I’d switch it to Shaffer’s Oil. Best oil on the market, not at all cheap but worth it. All we used at Simplot.
648 2018-07-14 22:17:39 Fried eggs and sausages taste better if you use butter rather than olive oil. Don't @ me.
649 2018-07-14 22:17:34 Yeah why you being so greedy trying to raise the gas prices it's enough oil on this planet to cover the whole goddamn Earth all y'all Being Greedy over the gas even here in the United States
650 2018-07-14 22:17:22 Tell me. If we have this much oil why are we importing oil from anyone else?????
651 2018-07-14 22:17:16 Yeah ? Good ! Please make sure , and don’t forget, to inform that not only are you the new EPA head, YOUR ALSO A FULL TIME PIMP FOR DONALD COMMANDER IN CREEP, with the oil and gas industry.....! Your now officially on the ENDANGERED SPECIES CAREER LIST .......
652 2018-07-14 22:17:04 Really? He expelled more diplomats than any other nation for Russian assasination. He has increased military spending. He has increased income to NATO. He called out Merkel using Russian gas/oil. Does that sound like a Putin Buddy? NO! And what did BO say, we can be flexible?

662 2018-07-14 22:16:03 This is a great opportunity to not just make new deals but also mend issues in the Middle East. Russia has a major oil deal with Syria. If Trump can get him friendly with Saudi, Syria and Iran will be dealt a massive blow.
663 2018-07-14 22:15:58 Who tryna get on dis oil wit me
664 2018-07-14 22:15:53 @ChrisCuomo Dems' attitude seems to be those Russians are nasty people we should just ignore. Pretty hard to do when they're the world's biggest oil producer & second strongest military. Naivete at its worst; but emotion and not reason seems to be liberals most common motivation.
665 2018-07-14 22:15:48 Actually Saudi Arabia gave Morocco $22billion in 2016 and they are the 3rd foreign investor in Morocco and most of our oil is subsidized from Saudi Arabia, zinosit?? We have economic relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia doesn't, care to clarify your tweet please
666 2018-07-14 22:15:44 Or Germany may have 2 do the RIGHT thing & buy their oil elsewhere. Like say from an allie, like the USA? Least they could do 2 compensate!

669 2018-07-14 22:15:32 Without a literal shot fired. No drone attack. No occupation. No oil stolen. Just facts released. And that's what scares the hell out of the Establishment.

695 2018-07-14 22:11:06 If a nation has extensive natural resources within its territory do you think that the wealth generated from those resources is kept by a few individuals or the citizens of that nation. If the oil is norwegian it belongs to Norwegians.

701 2018-07-14 22:10:07 Oil…  its about that and real estate. Look at the rich people in Russia. Rich off oil. They are meeting to devise a plan what country we are going to invade together the oil. Probably Iraq. Next either Venezuela or Niger.

727 2018-07-14 22:05:47 Why the hell is the U.S. still importing as much crude oil as it does? Oil/gas prices have surged. Oil is a strategic asset and the U.S. ought not be exporting it.

Still, I would say that it’s eorth noting @Orsted’s pivot from DONG (Denmark Oil & Natural Gas) to a wholly focused renewable energy company.
742 2018-07-14 22:01:48 // It's only soggy if they don't get the oil hot enough before they start cooking the chicken in it. That's the problem with deep-fried food. Get the oil too hot, it gets too crunchy on the outside. Not hot enough, and the food soaks up a lot of oil and comes out soggy.

749 2018-07-14 22:00:32 The mass arresting of all the top honchos of our oil industry is the biggest accountability coup pulled off thus far by the resurgent state. Expect a significant reduction in the price of oil in coming days!

795 2018-07-14 21:51:51 Then just brown your meat, and I browned the rice in oil. Add everything to a large crockpot and about 4 cups of water. Cooked on high for like an hour and a half and low for 4 hours. And I stirred it every 45 min and added water as needed! Add bell peppers in the last 45 min

Benefits: 
• sugar removes dead skin 
• olive oil hydrated and moisturises 
P.s. if you want it to plump your lips, use a peppermint flavouring.
853 2018-07-14 21:44:34 Oh please! “A victim of green activism.”
Since when has “green activism” created victims?Ppl lose jobs in oil & gas if we switch to renewables so they can get jobs in renewable energy industry. I guess u wld rather make ppl perm.sick& miscarry babies cause that’s what u r doing.
854 2018-07-14 21:44:16 I got sooooo many compliments on my curls today. s/o to avocado oil & jojoba oil
855 2018-07-14 21:44:11 In summary, @GrandvilleShow, if it's so inexpensive to buy American oil and ship it via tanker, why are the Germans buying it from Russia.  That would seem to be contrary to their own best interests, wouldn't it?
856 2018-07-14 21:44:05 You Guys... Musk only gave the money to tge GoP PAC to make his fight for alternative fuels harder to tire the big oil corporations out. Don't you see his genius?
857 2018-07-14 21:43:50 News flash you need oil to make an electric vehicle
858 2018-07-14 21:43:49 U play football, is it the One Ronaldo plays?

860 2018-07-14 21:43:21 I don’t feel bad anymore. They tried to finesse me into a 200 dollar oil change.
861 2018-07-14 21:43:17 Plus: I tended to the large aquariums today. 

Minus: had to euthanize a fish in one. Now everything smells like clove oil and sadness
862 2018-07-14 21:43:04 Souda you high
863 2018-07-14 21:43:02 Would that be the same you in that prostitutes itself for the Arab oil dollar? The same UN that appointed human rights violators to run the Human Rights Council? The same UN who's President even stated they were biased or Israel is concerned?
864 2018-07-14 21:43:00 How many yeats have the "diplomatic" types been in charge? And look where it's got us - proxy wars left right and centre that benefit nobody but the military indusyrial complex and the mega corps that get the contracts for cleaning up and the oil! It's about time someone stopped
865 2018-07-14 21:42:56 I’m on 300mg, 3 times a day, already. Still suffering. Started trying CBD (cannabis oil) tablets yesterday. Fingers crossed.
866 2018-07-14 21:42:46 Use peppermint oil on your skin, it repels them.
867 2018-07-14 21:42:40 I just took 4 drops of rose oil instead of flu medication. Send help. Smh
868 2018-07-14 21:42:21 I imagine wasps in top hats! Except I also imagine them as wealthy corporate leaders of oil fields in poor third world countries, driving people out of their homes to build more oil pumps for more profit and income...
869 2018-07-14 21:42:19 Excuse me, two packs of indomie=200, I hot dog from shoprite=200, carrot ,green beans ,cooking oil=250, workmanship=350, Total=#1000, how is a plate of indomie cost #2500?
870 2018-07-14 21:42:10 Then, HONEY, ship oil to Europe from the Middle East, assuming we must go by boat. Further, it seems Germany is a sovereign entitled to buy where and how they choose.  Meanwhile, you missed the whole point, which is we could have sold renewable energy to Germany but for Trump.
871 2018-07-14 21:42:04 Depends on the chemicals, if the chemical is adapted from nature and decays into harmless components ( has a short half-life ) I am okay with it.   Stuff like Orange oil as an insecticide/repellent is fine by me.  Genetic engineering is fine, if it is just cross breeding.

873 2018-07-14 21:41:55 It makes amazing pop corn ... the secret is to soap the corn in water for 10 minutes 1st. Dry and place in a paper bag, no oil necessary

875 2018-07-14 21:41:36 Now Canada needs to get on board and approve pipelines. We could own the oil and gas businesses

881 2018-07-14 21:40:42 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
882 2018-07-14 21:40:42 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

885 2018-07-14 21:40:21 Which cuticle oil are you using?
886 2018-07-14 21:40:09 And just because it's in the news it might not be true at all. Keep in mind Elon Musk has haters from the oil industry.
887 2018-07-14 21:40:07 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
888 2018-07-14 21:40:06 What is it that you would like to debate? The idea that big oil (who's pockets Cornyn resides inside of) would like to extinguish the ethanol industry, or ANY renewable energy source?
889 2018-07-14 21:39:50 And lessening protections on fragile ecosystems and animals while asking for speech protections for poor, innocent widdle corporations to... keep lobbying for the rights to dump motor oil into the Potomac and hunt wolves?

Nah. 

I think I'll just go have my morning abortion.
890 2018-07-14 21:39:48 That’s pretty ironic, @elonmusk 
You do realize that those guys hate clean air and are heavily bought by the oil industry to impede visions like yours to help keep fossil fuels from polluting the environment, don’t you?
891 2018-07-14 21:39:48 oh Wulfgar your followers are canny enough tae ken that Eidyn grew inro a royal burgh very recently & Donaeld is lucky he just got a rabble of peasants instead of buckets of boiling oil

894 2018-07-14 21:39:28 I will not tune in to anything with that oil salesman Adam Schiff. I'd rather watch Jim Acosta.
895 2018-07-14 21:39:15 Use oil or lotion
896 2018-07-14 21:38:58 Ingredients: 
• Flavouring eg. Vanilla extract or lemon. If you want to make an exact replica of the lush one, use bubblegum flavour 
• Food colouring of your choice. Preferably red or pink
• granulated sugar 
• olive oil
897 2018-07-14 21:38:45 bro I got back home like 2am . Then had take bike let Zach change oil an clean clutch out. I went sleep at 6am lol
898 2018-07-14 21:38:43 That stand will surely ruin everything

900 2018-07-14 21:38:07 Nope ,thats not the point of view,Al muhim,I don't like it when a lady stays out fr long
901 2018-07-14 21:38:06 oil, salt, the taste of the ocean?? disgusting. I'll stick with this jumbo box of corn waffle toaster snacks thank you very much
902 2018-07-14 21:37:58 EXFOLIATING 
– Keeping your legs well-exfoliated is very important and a key way to prevent those dark pores. Exfoliating the skin will help get rid of any excess oil, dirt or bacteria. Doing this will also keep your skin at less risk of irritation.
903 2018-07-14 21:37:50 I hate spicy food but why do i put the gochujang and sesame oil combo on my rice with anything fried 
904 2018-07-14 21:37:46 Jiffy lube says a oil change is $95...does that sound right ??? Lmao

908 2018-07-14 21:37:05 Have not tried it but Rocky Mountain Soap has a tea tree oil one for $9.

913 2018-07-14 21:36:41 So a few hours ago we had a swarm of flying ants,everywhere!It was like a biblical plaque. I thought it was being punished for my past experiences.I stepped outside and I had oil all over my body . loads of them stuck to my skin.I felt like old fashioned flytrap paper. Horrible.
914 2018-07-14 21:36:26 Amazing!!!! Great touch guys 
915 2018-07-14 21:36:19 My day has been maaaaad busy.

916 2018-07-14 21:36:14 War all about the oil and greed there
917 2018-07-14 21:36:13 daily shoutout to "Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides" by SOPHIE cause it's the AOTY
918 2018-07-14 21:36:12 It's been a very long and crazy day. I don't remember if I did eat today, except night curd w/ honey and oil.
919 2018-07-14 21:36:02 I'm discovering a newfound love and appreciation for acrylics. Shhhh. Don't tell my oil paints.
#artist #art
920 2018-07-14 21:35:56  I’ll get the oil
921 2018-07-14 21:35:51 I use CBD oil at random and mostly because I like the taste.  Scientific? Sure. Medically sound? Why not.
922 2018-07-14 21:35:48 It’s a pretty oil experience my dude. Glad I was able to do it a few times
923 2018-07-14 21:35:31 I run through coconut oil & coco butter so fast omg everytime you look up I gotta buy more
924 2018-07-14 21:35:31 Bansan shiririta
925 2018-07-14 21:35:22 And peppermint oil if you have any. That’s how I got rocky his previous mom was afraid of bugs So bad that he had lesions and scabs but a hot bath with a flea comb twice a day and olive oil and he was clearing a couple days.
926 2018-07-14 21:35:21 So many good things will come from non THC hemp and CBD oil with very few drawabacks. I'm sure the big phama companies are in a panic though.
927 2018-07-14 21:35:20 I might like oil better than acrylic
928 2018-07-14 21:35:18 Hoosiers with their more than 50 States and oil money , are responsible.  Every place with jews is in conflict. Only one tiny islamic State is a a safe heaven
929 2018-07-14 21:35:12 levantine garlic and oil paste, like an aioli except much more garlic
930 2018-07-14 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this July? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
931 2018-07-14 21:34:54 And yet, we’re paying almost $3 a gallon. Big Oil has decided our tax savings belongs to them.
932 2018-07-14 21:34:47 Love how lazy as fk @CostaMesaHonda mechanics are. Always something stupid when you have my car.. oil change sticker said last service was 99k car has only 30k on it.. marked my cabin filter as dirty (it's brand new installed it myself) 

Last time you had my car it was  too.
933 2018-07-14 21:34:43 Someone give me a cooking show where I dig around in my kids' backpacks for an applesauce pouch to sub for the vegetable oil I'm out of.
@FoodNetwork?
934 2018-07-14 21:34:41 Lol y the question though sani
935 2018-07-14 21:34:35 What? But why? How? No way. No way.

He's a man of science.  Why would he fund the #climatedeniers ? 

He believes in electric cars. Why would he fund the #coal and #oil lobby?

Please Elon. Let there be a good explanation for this.

939 2018-07-14 21:34:01 <0.1% of the fuel is from dino organic mass
100% of dino organic mass turns to oil

the dinos statement isn't wrong

943 2018-07-14 21:33:10 oil spills make me cry
944 2018-07-14 21:32:37 Yes I’m a mechanic... yes I can change my own oil... do I look like I need the flirting to get it done 
945 2018-07-14 21:32:20 Swimming and laying out, eating fresh fruit and obsessing over the books we’re reading and promising to trade when we’re both done, making sure we stay hydrated with a good layer of oil at all times, making plans for the evening. Friendships in the summer.
946 2018-07-14 21:32:10 Kids totally need a different diet, even I vaguely understand that. I used to sell my Homemade Pesto Olive Oil to a woman whose son smashed a whole bottle of it and a focaccia loaf when he got home from school.
947 2018-07-14 21:31:59 It’s a share of that sweet, sweet oil cash once sanctions are dropped.
948 2018-07-14 21:31:51 Oil or flowers? 
949 2018-07-14 21:31:41 I just woke up from a nap and I went straight to the oil change place. Ain’t brushed my teeth or nothing and this man is in my face asking me all kinds of questions. I feel so bad. 
950 2018-07-14 21:31:38 And it will be hell-fraught. Good for the workers, bad for the environment. Not a long-term solution. PS the oil barons will find a reason to increase price too, after all, profit is the American way. And eventually, our supply will dwindle too, it's not limitless.
951 2018-07-14 21:31:33 lmao !! i put it in coco oil and fill
capsules or candy like 20mg
952 2018-07-14 21:31:05 Yeah...it's thick and just sticks like oil.

954 2018-07-14 21:30:54 I just wish I knew all this 1yr. N half ago as that's when I lost my partner to throat cancer as his body had to be more alkaline and I couldn't get my hands on money for cannabis oil to treat him as I know in my heart he would have put up the biggest fight
955 2018-07-14 21:30:26 Pull up your pants, hippie
956 2018-07-14 21:30:24 I’ve gone through an entire container of vitamin e oil lotion in the last 24 hours. My skin strongly resembles a tomato. Plz send help.

961 2018-07-14 21:29:57 I use the L'oreal extra ordinary oil to moisturize , it works wonderfully
962 2018-07-14 21:29:52 I prefer pasta the old Sicilian way - with olive oil, roasted garlic, lots of Parmesan cheese.
963 2018-07-14 21:29:44 ...at least I got my oil changed and I’m pretty much packed for CO. #lazySaturday 
964 2018-07-14 21:29:24 a nice glaze of Johnson's Baby Oil will deliver that perfect Thanksgiving turkey bronze glow
965 2018-07-14 21:29:11 Yar Pakistan didn’t have an oil boom as I said can’t compare. Also completely different political-economic system. I have seen that interview of Sheikh Mohammed and what’s he’s done for his people is v impressive. But can’t be compared with Pakistan.
966 2018-07-14 21:29:05 Unbelievable
967 2018-07-14 21:29:04 Successfully changed the oil to my vehicle with the help of @Its_Me_Geb
968 2018-07-14 21:28:50 We do have excess. But there are different types of oil. Many of our refineries were built to process heavy oil from other countries. So they import oil from Canada, Mexico, wherever for their refineries and we export light oil to countries that have refineries for that type.
969 2018-07-14 21:28:47 I remember most of it, like Obama making amends with Iran, giving them billions, and allowing them to bring 4m barrels of oil per day back to the world market, all without the consent of any American whatsoever. That’s pro-enemy and anti-America. Period twice.
970 2018-07-14 21:28:35 Iraq's Basra region accounts for 3.5 million bpd oil production and protesters have threatend to shut it down. Could give WTI and Brent a giant leap if Iraqi govt fails to calm things down $CL_F
971 2018-07-14 21:28:33 Sitting getting my oil changed- one worker gave me his number, while the othe is talking to me like I am 5
972 2018-07-14 21:28:33 .@realDonaldTrump is allowing a petty act of revenge to destroy a valuable source of medical research reports. Now when the US medical team looks to the HHS for guildence they will see something like: Headache try snake oil, blood disorder try leaches, Cancer try praying. etc
973 2018-07-14 21:28:24 We can barley get sick children cannabis oil needed for serious medical conditions !!!!! It will be decades before any serious law changes to make it like cigarettes and alcohol. Need to get with the times

976 2018-07-14 21:27:57 Oil demand is growing not slowing.   It will never really die but sure at some point it will be diminished severely, but that time isn’t around the corner it’s decades away.
977 2018-07-14 21:27:35 Luckily the quills are oil paint so they don't sting quite as much.
978 2018-07-14 21:27:14 Yep that's good for me too, I got little bit of fettling in morning, fork oil top try to reduce tingles in right hand, 
979 2018-07-14 21:27:07 speaking of, the other day I unpacked an organized all my art supplies which included ink that had spilled and oil paints, and today I unpacked/organized all my makeup, skincare, bath stuff etc. Today was by far messier lol although mostly cuz of lush bath bombs
980 2018-07-14 21:27:03 honestly i never purchase from my job bc im a snob! only thing i ever buy is rick simpson oil bc it's the most bang for ur buck

983 2018-07-14 21:26:45 There isn’t even an actual recognized government in Libya & they are selling oil left right and center! The country is split almost in 4 parts. Notice how that doesn’t make the news at all?
984 2018-07-14 21:26:39 Tomatoes sautéed in coconut oil with cumin and red pepper fuccs me up bitch.
985 2018-07-14 21:26:09 Dim the lights, have something icy cold. Detach yourself from all electronic devices. I doubt you would have lavender oil but putting some on the temples when you do all the following instruction helps. But without lavender oil won't be so bad either.
986 2018-07-14 21:26:07 I love that my best friend’s mom and mine sell CBD oil together. @karleejs. P.S I miss you.

988 2018-07-14 21:25:58 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

990 2018-07-14 21:25:54 Scarlet Johansson: has a thundering inability to read the room and understand what roles are not suitable for a white cis woman in 2018.

I will still take that over Gwyneth Paltrow building a financial empire by selling snake oil.
991 2018-07-14 21:25:48 Palm oil in Ecuador is done well w organic inter-cropped agroforestry on reclaimed land. Unfortunately that's less than 1% of production.  We need 2 get beyond "bad" or "good" foods & focus on replicating best systems. HOW + appropriateness of WHERE often more important than WHAT
992 2018-07-14 21:25:38 I’m not certain exporting is a good idea. Maybe we should keep American oil and gas for America’s use.  I wish America would try to be “energy independent”.  I still believe we should be trying to conserve our oil and gas.  It’s a very limited resource.
993 2018-07-14 21:25:26 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
994 2018-07-14 21:25:20 Y DID I BUCKLED MY SEAT BELT WHILE MARTIN WAS DOING MY OIL CHANGE LMAO LMAO I hate myself
995 2018-07-14 21:25:18 (2/2) customs interest (our fuel, oil, gas, coal) or special checks already (all animals arrive in Larne, plant and grain checks - though most of that comes transatlantic). What’s left is a small amount by volume and value which originated in GB which can be handled without cost

998 2018-07-14 21:24:42 I have lived in Dubai for 10+ years but you can hardly compare it to Pakistan. It started of with plenty of oil money and has a completely different culture and political/economic environment. NS didn’t fix everything but he was a hell of a lot better than that Musharraf.
999 2018-07-14 21:24:37 #oott We have more gasoline inventories than a year ago. And much higher gasoline inventory in china than 2016. @anasalhajji How is this bullish for oil ?

1001 2018-07-14 21:24:29 8. So, oil & gas industry lies to keep their industry making big bucks. Doesn’t matter to them that they r making thousands of ppl sick permanently, even children.They don’t care that what they do contaminants drinking water for entire cities.
1002 2018-07-14 21:24:09 Hello Doctor Mark. I knew Dr Shipman, now he knew how to sell snake oil, and was rather deadly. Big Pharma drugs kill more people than die a natural death.
1003 2018-07-14 21:23:52 I’m having a lot of fun with the lineless doodles I’ve been doing in procreate and I just realized it’s bc it feels more like painting to me, loose and messy ahhh.. just like college.. can almost smell the oil paints

1005 2018-07-14 21:23:34 Well it wouldn't take as long as EE - see that as your oil painting, Eldorado would simply be a sketch.
1006 2018-07-14 21:23:25 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
1007 2018-07-14 21:23:20 i’ve been on T for 3 months, and so far things have been really great!! but the ONE THING THAT PISSES ME OFF!!!! is the amount of oil that is on my body and with all that oil comes weird scalp pimples. not on my face!! my head
1008 2018-07-14 21:23:12 What do I do with it tho? You telling me to apply oil to a oily area? Pls help.
1009 2018-07-14 21:23:12 I thought it was more than the Jews though. It’s the Oil Baron’s kids & whatnot practicing orgiastic satanism to channel alien spirit guides. Yeah, yeah. But the Paul thing seems to attack at just the structure of it.

1016 2018-07-14 21:22:29 Norway has an oil fund, the middle east oil has delivered great wealth to the ruling families.

Why then is Scotland so disadvantaged in places?
Westminster flushed it all away, and still people trot out the ridiculous "better together with broad shoulders"

Praise for muggers.
1017 2018-07-14 21:22:27 If I have 50k to spare, I would go buy baby oil and some sexy for my lady,  something to eat. Rub the oil on her and hit the her like it's the end of the world, next day I still got 49k left to do it all over again
1018 2018-07-14 21:22:06 No!   Please tell us that you will vote against your party re oil drilling off our beautiful coast, stand up to your party And call 45 out on allowing Russian sabotage to happen and allowing it to continue and to call an end to Separation of Immigrants from their Children

1021 2018-07-14 21:22:01 After calling @KrauseFord for an oil change appointment I was told I don't need an appointment- show up anytime for fast and easy service. I show up today and was told they don't have time, call for an appointment. I'm an unhappy @FordService customer. #donotbuyserviceplan
1022 2018-07-14 21:21:39 At least she's trying. Maybe it's financially motovated and insincere, but she's still trying, if only for her career. Gwyneth Paltrow is a literal snake oil selling looney and no one says boo about it.
1023 2018-07-14 21:21:36 Funny to think it's one of the only oil rig platforms on land.
1024 2018-07-14 21:21:29 More like if you want man boobs from the phyto-estrogens, eat more soy. Though if u eat a lot of process food, u already eat a lot of soy in the form of fat, and processed ingredients. In the US per FAOSTATs, US consumes approx 600 calories a days from soybean oil.
1025 2018-07-14 21:21:24  they missed the freestyle about his gun, “So I like to spoil her, rub her down and oil her
She don't fuck with punks cause they seem to avoid her..”

1028 2018-07-14 21:20:53 No you are not.  My husband has no financial interest in the oil and gas industry and never has.  Withdraw the accusation.
1029 2018-07-14 21:20:48 You’ve got that back to front. Scottish oil props up UK currency and allows UK to borrow. Borrowing pays for UK spending including Scotland’s “grant” Indy is coming, enjoy your lost rights, private healthcare and shit food standards. EU holds all cards, UK is fkd, self inflicted
1030 2018-07-14 21:20:47 He leaves behind a trail of patchouli oil.
1031 2018-07-14 21:20:17 Tesla provides "something good and useful"?  "Upsets big oil"? A "source that suits your leanings"? You assume much without evidence or intelligence to back your statement. Bye.
1032 2018-07-14 21:20:14 My hair is anti olive oil and coconut oil.
1033 2018-07-14 21:20:09 And buy some oil from my friend
1034 2018-07-14 21:20:07 RIGHT!!! throw some baby oil on them joints
1035 2018-07-14 21:20:00 I’m sure there are plenty of people that do the same.. if you’re working hard as a corporation to ensure that your palm oil is sustainable then it should be indicated and people are able to shop happy! My PB ran out this morning so tomorrow’s breakfast is going to be lacklustre!
1036 2018-07-14 21:19:52 Came in for a funky ass oil change
1037 2018-07-14 21:19:46 Oil and automotive lobby...

1039 2018-07-14 21:19:27 If you trust a Silicon Valley bro I've got a bridge in Brooklyn and some snake oil to sell you. Trust no sociopathic white man (or woman...here's looking at you, Elizabeth Holmes.)

＼It's OIL!!!／
1041 2018-07-14 21:18:31 Carpentersville - HAZMAT - Rt 31 & Huntley Rd - Crews have a 3 feet wide tar spill onto the roadway.  Rt 31 is blocked to north bound traffic, public works requested with a dump truck of sand and requesting oil dry from all rigs on scene.
1042 2018-07-14 21:18:23 What is truly incredible is that he "doubled or tripled" the size of the US economy while also turning the country into an oil exporter, the biggest ever. Its tremendous.
1043 2018-07-14 21:18:22 You progressives have been screaming peak oil for decades.
1044 2018-07-14 21:17:51 7. The oil & gas industry pub.relation or disinformation campaign continually pumps out delib.lies about renewable energy, like a lot of ppl will lose their jobs if we switch to renewables. Right now there r more job openings in renewable energy than oil & gas industry.
1045 2018-07-14 21:17:43 They spilled oil all over my neighborhood.
1046 2018-07-14 21:17:22 Hmm, how about whale oil?
1047 2018-07-14 21:17:06 Greg Pence has had nothing to do with Kiel Bros. Oil (family business) since 2004. Well I guess not since that’s the year the company went out of business.
1048 2018-07-14 21:16:29 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1049 2018-07-14 21:16:13 3/3  RU finances the pipeline and the U.S. buys oil from them.  Remember ALL these senators are on the Senate Appropriations Cmte and Granger is on one of the House appropriations cmte (she was a 'last minute' addition to the delegation).
1050 2018-07-14 21:16:08 Kinda stepped away from daily baseball updates bc I didn’t wanna be more stressed and just popped in play by plays while waiting for an oil change o see Harper out. Nice timing. Fuck Harper lmaooo

1055 2018-07-14 21:15:39 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1056 2018-07-14 21:15:36 Thank you for the reply @marksandspencer - that’s great to hear but I think this could be more clearly labelled for the consumer. I often buy Whole Earth PB because it clearly states that the palm oil used is sustainably sourced. If something just says palm oil I won’t buy it..
1057 2018-07-14 21:15:33 Yes. I need oil change..turbo boost..
1058 2018-07-14 21:15:17 If they didn’t have work they couldn’t invest. Downturn in oil and gas industry forced a lot to move into my industry and drive wages lower.

1063 2018-07-14 21:14:56 He did. He lived in my town & I worked at the gas station he frequented. He was friends with the owner & used to come in for gas. I'd fill the tank, wash the windows, check the oil & tires as he bullshitted with Dom. He had a shit-ton of other nicer cars, though. Super nice guy.
1064 2018-07-14 21:14:47 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, the same oil and with the same heat conditions, but they don't pop at the same time, your time Isn't my time, but we'll all pop!!

1067 2018-07-14 21:14:29 I’m so confused...I don’t even recognize the province they go on about...all around me things look pretty darn good! My family who works in oil r still working...everyone who wants a job has one...they have houses & money 4 time off, k there might b some who don’t, but come on!
1068 2018-07-14 21:14:27 They don't sit on oil reserves. You're simply wrong.
1069 2018-07-14 21:14:20 Would love to rub oil into them for you.... would you like that?

1079 2018-07-14 21:13:11 i think you can circumvent the non combat uses by allowing the hand to pick up flasks of oil and drop them on enemies, and then grabbing torches and dropping them on the now oiled enemies. but yea no spell casting through the hand,.
1080 2018-07-14 21:13:08 Yes it is an original oil.
1081 2018-07-14 21:13:00 My diet these days mainly consists of:

- Greek yogurt + meat
- Rice, high-quality sourdough, fruit, gnocchi
- Some veggies
- Olive oil + Ghee
- Kombucha
- Ice cream

Literally the best I've ever looked, even compared to my competitive bodybuilding days.
1082 2018-07-14 21:12:55 6. Oil & gas industry has bribed public officials to keep them quiet,lied to the public about the health probs associated w/fracking &even commissioned false “scientific” studies to keep public from knowing the truth.Even worse, they have a very active public relations campaign
1083 2018-07-14 21:12:40 i just got two new tires , a battery and an oil change all within three hours 
1084 2018-07-14 21:12:25 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

1089 2018-07-14 21:11:32 North Dakota's oil production set a record in May due to rebounding crude prices. The state produced an average of 1.24 million barrels of oil daily in May. up more than 19,000 barrels daily from April, and more than 17,000 barrels from the previous record set in December 2014.
1090 2018-07-14 21:11:20 I wanted somebody daughter last night, now I want ya mah... On that damn oil again
1091 2018-07-14 21:11:14 Here's the message that is sent when a government, any government, cancels 758 renewable energy contracts - "We're closed for business! Ontario has no interest in green jobs, green investment or green energy!"
@ontariopcparty @fordnation - No doubt big oil is happy.

1096 2018-07-14 21:11:03 My cooler failed and filled the coolant full of oil.  Switched to a air cooled rad.  Over 3 million k on my tranny now.  Never been apart.
1097 2018-07-14 21:10:58 Alsoooo find a good primer that doesn’t contail oil! Helps keep a matte finish longer b4 the oils peak thru 
1098 2018-07-14 21:10:55 Instead of accidentally firing a sylladex full of steak knives into a priceless oil painting or your beloved great aunt, you can turn that fumbling fury toward one of your foes, such as the ability to grasp painfully simple concepts.

1101 2018-07-14 21:10:45 ...grease traps contain a mixture of vegetable oil, animal fat and other food waste, which is why it rots and stinks...but, together with other mixed food waste, it is being successfully recycled into a very rich and valuable compost called "Black Gold" for aiding plant growth...
1102 2018-07-14 21:10:41 Bud has been making some essential oil boxes that are available in the store. One of our customers needed a special size so he made these custom ones for her. They look so pretty all full of oil bottles

1111 2018-07-14 21:09:52 Can’t remember the details, but another critique is that they added extra fat to ordinary high carb rat chow. The fat might have been unhealthy refined seed oil. Not a high quality diet.
1112 2018-07-14 21:09:51 @C_NyaKundiH  I know together with @MboyaApollo and @JerotichSeii you've been doing an exceptional job on this. @ODPP_KE great job seeing you burning midnight oil to bring sanity in our public institutions bedevilled by corruption.

An oil crisis, a shaken G7 & NATO Government in turmoil losing in Syria kids being separated from parents, the supreme court, the Russia investigation.

To get the oil, the fruit and its seed have to be crushed by a great weight in an olive press. The crushing also removes the bitterness. (5/7)
1138 2018-07-14 21:07:27 I'd give Larry King interviews on Russia TV network the old fish eye. Speaking of which, Larry also wants to sell you some fish oil, and some prostate pills, and breath mints.

1141 2018-07-14 21:07:15 That’s it, I’m done! Someone brought in a large bucket with a garbage bag of chemical containers (don’t do that) and said one was leaking oil, hence the bucket. THEY TRIED TO PASS OFF POOP AS OIL/WATER MIXTURE. POOP! I’m so done rn. There isn’t a beer large enough

Olive oil comes from the olive fruit. But when you press the fruit real hard, you won’t find oil, only a white sap. Also, the fruit tastes very bitter. (4/7)

Keep in mind that all of these problems associated w/fracking: lifelong poor health, fetal abnormalities, fire hazards from toxic gases can b eliminated by switching to renewable energy.

The UK has already negotiated Trade deals
Fisheries will be open to foreign boats
It's easier for oil majors to invest elsewhere
America wont deal with you
The UN wont recognise you
You'll lose your seat on Security Council
You'll lose access to British ports
1153 2018-07-14 21:05:30 You wont be able to acces the internal market so you wont be able to sell us your oil, electricity, water or anything else England couldnt survive without.
1154 2018-07-14 21:05:30 Canada could also make a HUGE contribution by calling it quits on their horrible tar sands oil.  Leave it in the ground where it belongs, we don't want your filthy tar sands oil!

1155 2018-07-14 21:05:14 Prior I was using straight oil. After using the puck, there is a noticeable difference in both the seasoning and non-stick quality.
1156 2018-07-14 21:05:06 @brandless just a thought - think about upping your fish oil tablet game and making one w/ the krill oil (like the MegaRed brand, etc). Just a thought for the future.
1157 2018-07-14 21:05:04 It was awesome... I loved some of the comments from the Calgary fans, and some of the “so” called oiler fans… It was gold

The grain and wine represent the Holy Communion, which speaks of the broken body of Jesus and the blood that He shed. To make bread, you take the wheat or grain, then crush and beat it to make dough. (2/7)
1159 2018-07-14 21:04:52 Guess it’s to much to ask to get all of your order in one trip. @BurgerKing must be getting  from big oil companies cause I always have to drive back for the food they forgot to put in the bag. Smh
1160 2018-07-14 21:04:41 Mad Max but instead of water or oil there’s a coffee shortage and everyone’s super cranky

Through the grain, wine and oil, we can receive by grace, not by accomplishing or striving, all the benefits of Jesus. Man ate his way into trouble in the Garden of Eden. By the same token, you can eat your way back into God’s blessings today. (1/7)
1162 2018-07-14 21:04:18 There’s a market for it, so it actually makes sense if you know how to do it properly.

You can compare it to Oil: some buy it for the utility and some other speculate with it. Both have their reasons :)
1163 2018-07-14 21:04:17 What matters is where the electricity generating factories are and if they were highly affected or not, Were the oil fields affected or not,
1164 2018-07-14 21:04:05 Interesting- I use flax oil.

1167 2018-07-14 21:04:00 Yeah see i remember this too. Every president bows to the King of Sand and Oil. They should bow to us under our mighty nukehammer.
1168 2018-07-14 21:03:43 Just stop doing stupid things like suing oil companies

1171 2018-07-14 21:02:34 America isn’t paying any bills, dummy. NATO is not a back account! 
Also, Trump only ranted because he had thought he could sell his own oil. He wants German money but Merkel knows better than to make deals with the orange wannabe dictator.
1172 2018-07-14 21:01:59 So we have a management team that can’t be trusted to evaluate and develop. They mismanaged into a corner and were forced to do nothing, which is actually a good. Thing. Yeah, the Oil are gonna be okay...

1184 2018-07-14 21:00:10 That's not accurate. 30% of Norway's taxes are on oil and gas. That's not even counting the largest company statoil, which Norway directly owns. Tax rates in Norway aren't even all that high.

1190 2018-07-14 20:59:14 That's an ace, but plenty of cards in the deck yet. How would Iran export? Its terminal is outside the straits, but while India is quite happy about a little blockade running, it wouldn't go far without Saudi oil.
1191 2018-07-14 20:59:10 Need brakes & an oil change 
1192 2018-07-14 20:59:05 What about rights to CLEAN WATER under Title 58 §3218 of Oil & Gas Act? Ray Kemble's water supply (Dimock) was REMOVED by Scott Perry's order 10/18/2011. BY WHAT AUTHORITY can Scott Perry decide who gets rights under law? ATSDR tested Ray's water in July 2017: STILL CONTAMINATED!
1193 2018-07-14 20:58:57 Cute conspiracy theory.
Climate science is science.
Campaign donations to politicians from wealthy industry sectors, e.g., oil, have created politicization of scientific research to produce public policy benefiting those industry sectors. Follow the existing money trail, love.

1214 2018-07-14 20:55:41 It’s time to do something for Nicaragua and Venezuela, at least don’t buy more oil to them!
1215 2018-07-14 20:55:21 It depends, friends are friends, drift away and you connect again, although things might not be the same anymore 
But letting someone you love go is definitely more painful because you still want them but you can't have them, like bread dipped in garlic oil

1264 2018-07-14 20:49:07 Ginger, oil of oregano, garlic extract turmeric, cayenne & lemon. #WellnessShots – bij Kale Me Crazy
1265 2018-07-14 20:49:03 I forgot how ugly the smell of oil paint is
1266 2018-07-14 20:48:49 If it was not for oil, do you know what would be the most common job in North America and Europe today? 

Will get back to subsidies later.
1267 2018-07-14 20:48:48 Tirame gas oil más vale así lo uso para un asado que me quede sin recién...
1268 2018-07-14 20:48:40 I’m dry and wrinkle prone. I use coconut oil before bed on my most wrinkled areas (corners of eyes, smile lines). Seems to be working.
1269 2018-07-14 20:48:38 It’s 60th anniversary of 14th July 1958 revolution in #Iraq. A great mass movement made historic gains: agrarian reform, nationalisation of oil, withdrawal from Baghdad Pact, many democratic rights...But CIA backed coup on 8th Feb 1963 destroyed much of the achievements.
1270 2018-07-14 20:48:34 wow. now this is called a QUESTION !
1271 2018-07-14 20:48:30 It’s helped me. A lot. I suffer from chronic pain (plus leg nerve pain). Although I mostly rely on high concentrations of CBD oil (legal in the uk), I wish the stronger stuff was easily + legally available
1272 2018-07-14 20:48:23 Finally got 4WD back in the van.

SO ridiculously delighted to have that back in service.

Just the oil leak from the turbo area to identify and resolve now.
1273 2018-07-14 20:48:18 69.00 for an oil change 
1274 2018-07-14 20:47:45 "See! You're not virgin oil because you're a cake."
1275 2018-07-14 20:47:40 Not my ‘brightest’ moment:
Neglecting to reapply sunscreen yesterday 
Fun fact:
Coconut oil with peppermint & lavender essential oils added is a great way to help skin begin to repair after sunburn 
Pleasant outcome:
My skin feels soft and I smell pretty amazing

1278 2018-07-14 20:47:25 That warm n sweet feeling when u use a stretcher on ur hair
1279 2018-07-14 20:47:18 Ya synchro material doesn't like glycol at all. Oil to water coolers come off any truck we use before the regen systems.

1281 2018-07-14 20:46:54 French fries have nothing to do with killing babies. (Well, unless your "clinics" are now frying fresh fetuses in hot oil.)
1282 2018-07-14 20:46:51 #SaturdayMorning Prescription pickup, oil change, grocery store, yard work. Uggg errands. #adultingsucks What happened to doing what you want as an adult?! Lol
1283 2018-07-14 20:46:26 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1284 2018-07-14 20:46:19 I certainly see the drying up of oil & the need for renewable BUT I'm "dried up" when it comes to making that connection from the 'delegation's' perspective - other than continuing to wipe out renewables.  Help me, pls
1285 2018-07-14 20:46:15 What gets me the most are the Trump supporters who aren't "stupid" but rather highly educated. Like the married doctors I know who voted Trump, only watch FOX news and love the whole fake news thing.
They have money in off shore oil accounts and want it back in US tax free.
1286 2018-07-14 20:46:14 Oil, shower......sounds ok to me 
1287 2018-07-14 20:46:11 And we have marijuana that grows from the earth that is for the most part (well in so many ways) a cure all. And I can't talk about #CBDProducts & CBD oil enough. It's the true way to go. I have good pages to recommend if people see this and wanna read up.

1289 2018-07-14 20:45:59 Burning lemongrass essential oil from @PlantTherapy and feeling completely relaxed 
1290 2018-07-14 20:45:51 Of course it has, the only reason this was not expected is because big oil lobbied against it so hard. Now they are buying electric car charging companies (I have some concerns about that).
1291 2018-07-14 20:45:44 Christians that secretly wish for the destruction of others are murders and the offspring of Cain. Only the wine and oil has legal right to destroy all darkness, darkness shall never destroy light.
1292 2018-07-14 20:45:36 "But you knit and sew and cook!"

"Yes. I'm always really careful to scrub my hands after I've been bike-fettling. Don't want chain oil all over the cupcakes"
1293 2018-07-14 20:45:25 There was an oil spill in my department at work and I have oil and kitty litter everywhere, I’m upset
1294 2018-07-14 20:45:20 .@PeterAttiaMD Awesome podcast w/ Ron Krauss. Would love a follow up on types of sat fat effects on LDL, sat fat predictive equations for tchol, and an in depth discussion on the “all fat is bad including coconut oil” debate. 
Can't wait for the next episode!!

1296 2018-07-14 20:44:52 I guess you haven't heard about Kalar/Garmyan. I work with an oil company there and they get attacked twice a week by villagers in that heat. Arabs are amateurs pfffft
1297 2018-07-14 20:44:15 This my point exactly - if you want compare Norway distribution model - compare in with UAE for example (invest in tourism, aviahub, skyscrapers, etc - rather than other countries equity). Or Singapore (without oil).
And Nigeria - with Venezuela, for that matter, or Iran.
1298 2018-07-14 20:44:11 Trump is willing - entirely willing - to comply with Putin’s demands and to support his initiatives. He covers with lies, snake oil, delusions and trickery. Everything one would expect of a willing co-conspirator.
1299 2018-07-14 20:44:11 Coconut  oil and it’s healing powers !
1300 2018-07-14 20:43:58 I used too much essential oil in my bath and my whole body is tingling  I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not lol
1301 2018-07-14 20:43:15 No, what that means is, in spite of such a proof right in front of our eyes, BJP is simply sitting and watching. it should annihilate all anti India forces....
1302 2018-07-14 20:43:15 A genocide is when you attack a country like Iraq over fake allegations just to steal their oil and leave 1 MIL people mostly civilians dead. Or when you throw an atomic bomb killing 85,000 innocent men women and children at once. That my friend is a genocide. Get off your horse.
1303 2018-07-14 20:43:12 If you don't spend time with #God, the oil in your lamp will go out.
1304 2018-07-14 20:42:58 Thwyre fried but the oil was warm not hot. I'm an angry chef when I get spat at  xx
1305 2018-07-14 20:42:51 Chickpea flour, mixed with some water, grated courgette, chopped paneer, chopped red onion, seasoning incl. cumin and garam masala, shallow fry in coconut oil. Dressed with lime juice.
1306 2018-07-14 20:42:45 “Exactly. I’m not oil.” He chuckled softly, looking to the small child.
1307 2018-07-14 20:42:35 and it’s okay to use an oil cleanser in morning and in the evening? i also bought a differin oil control acne moisturizer, should i toss that too? 
1308 2018-07-14 20:42:31 Damn I gotta learn how to change oil. A tire is common sense after the first time but um
1309 2018-07-14 20:42:31 Separation of church and state has nothing to do with welfare. Maybe look up the dictionary meaning of welfare? Most oil rich monarchies are welfare states for their locals. Free ed, health care, housing. They are all Islamic. This is almost pitiful.
1310 2018-07-14 20:42:20 Germany: Russia cannot be trusted. Trump is being too nice to Putin. Russia cannot be a member of the G7.

Germany: We are going to buy 70% of our oil and gas from Russia for billions of dollars.

Dems/Leftists: Trump is Putin's puppet.

Conserv: What about Germany?

*crickets*
1311 2018-07-14 20:42:01 There is real GENOCIDE ongoing in Hebrew Biafra and South Cameroon by British govt and their jihadists , French govt =( Globalist) to steal oil and gas. Not a WORD from Left or Media or UN or World Leaders except Potus45 and PM ISRAEL.
1312 2018-07-14 20:41:53 It is important for us ALL to remember that it was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who stopped any bipartisan action before the election against the Russian attack.  Trump, you knew this!  Let's talk Russian Oil and your bank account!
1313 2018-07-14 20:41:35 anyone know anything about cbd oil ???
1314 2018-07-14 20:41:30 Positive to see PM Abadi with an address towards the demands of protestors in Basra which include unfreezing of Basra petro-dollars. Important that protest demands are heard and met despite the vandalism of oil facilities and public property.
1315 2018-07-14 20:41:15 This is false news. The US produces 10 million BPD and consumes 20 million BPD of oil. That makes them net importers of 10 million BPD.
1316 2018-07-14 20:41:14 Is there anything such as too much coconut oil
1317 2018-07-14 20:41:11 Burned my fingers on hot oil so badly today (@ work) I wanted to cry but go off I guess
1318 2018-07-14 20:40:41 "You're not oil, Gabby."
1319 2018-07-14 20:40:37 Haha Sami rawon lo Sama gue Mas Bro.. Tp biasa2 aja, lo gak usah di kasih tau ke orang2 klo Kerja di Oil & Gas field..malu alias tengsin , lha wong skrng crude Oil lg krisis hrg nya,,dunia offshore gk bisa jadi kebanggan lg skrng , NDC tau bngt lah gue
1320 2018-07-14 20:40:33 Thank God!!!
I’m seriously tired of the oil and  prehistoric ways.
1321 2018-07-14 20:40:31 @________Ash what’s the name of the castor oil you use?
1322 2018-07-14 20:40:30 pls change ur oil so you don’t blow up while driving & die

How!? #GirlsTalkZA 
Do you use it as shampoo? Or as hair food?!
1326 2018-07-14 20:40:09 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
1327 2018-07-14 20:40:05 Trump holds stakes in 3 major oil companies,per FEC filings. Russia is one of largest oil producers and along with the Saudis have cut back oil production to raise profits and cash in
1328 2018-07-14 20:39:58 My fren, follow the history of oil production in Africa. This issue is bigger than deploying the GSU. The kind of thinking that "every conflict can be solved by arm twisting the locals" doesn't work everywhere.

That reasoning is archaic, juvenile and overtaken by events!
1329 2018-07-14 20:39:43 But y are NEPA like these for God sake @IkejaElectric ,small rain that fell yesterday, no light till today,same thing last weekend, WTF
1330 2018-07-14 20:39:36 3. Then the Houston oil boom busted and the flow reversed. Poor Houstonians, in cars, having left house keys in the door, looking for work.
1331 2018-07-14 20:39:31 Peppermint oil on your neck and temples!  works like a charm!
1332 2018-07-14 20:39:25 Huge crowd for @realDonaldTrump!
1333 2018-07-14 20:39:12 Do you believe in unicorns as well? Farage is a snake oil salesman and you’ve been suckered by him
1334 2018-07-14 20:39:06 2. The "black taggers": were chased out of suburban neighborhoods by Houstonians made rich in the oil boom.
1335 2018-07-14 20:38:52 Olive oil and coconut oil is SAVING me
1336 2018-07-14 20:38:31 お目当てのNAHAVANDみれなかったけど憧れのOlive Oil最っ高に気持ち良かった〜！
1337 2018-07-14 20:38:28 Bio oil!! And palmers lotion!! I found both at the PX!! 
1338 2018-07-14 20:38:16 I’m all about essential oils and peppermint worked really well for me! You can put it in a diffuser, or dilute it a little with almond/coconut oil (I used water to dilute it lol) and then put it under your nose! Kind of like Vick’s vapor rub but just inhaling it helps me so much
1339 2018-07-14 20:37:59 Bruh coconut oil will really change your life.
1340 2018-07-14 20:37:27 It's a special formula that took Dame Daphne 28 yrs to perfect. Basically, it's powdered milk with coconut oil. There's probably more to it.
1341 2018-07-14 20:37:24 And Venezuela’s economy collapsed because of oil, was revamped do to policies that you guys call socialism, and continued the collapse due to shady governance. Still not socialism. But, let’s blame my history teacher. 
1342 2018-07-14 20:37:09 Um. Obama opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower global oil prices was probably the number one factor in wrecking Venezuela’s economy and causing the current situation there.

Of course, maybe they should have diversified their economy...
1343 2018-07-14 20:37:00 My girlfriend asked, "Would you like a slidy oil lubed orgasm?"
I said, "Do bears shit in the woods?"
Wish I'd just said 'Yes',
She's been on Google ever since.
1344 2018-07-14 20:36:57 smothering my body in apple cider vinegar & oil im the hopes of turning sunburn brown 
1345 2018-07-14 20:36:55 There’s oil on ur lip
1346 2018-07-14 20:36:22 If you can get it...and if everyone does...otherwise, we end up with people bankrupted by unexpected expenses.

DPC is a great model--auto insurance doesn't cover oil changes, car washes, wiper blades--but everyone having some form of coverage in place for the unexpected is vital
1347 2018-07-14 20:36:04 Yep. Given that they - Saudi's - owe The Donald for turning a blind eye to the invasion of Yemen and the blockade of Qatar. If The Donald phoned MBS and told him to open the taps, oil would be $10.00 a barrel cheaper the next day.

1350 2018-07-14 20:35:57 It makes perfect sense for Beto to get donations from celebrities in CA. He is fighting for the poorest who reside in Tx. He will work for the little guy with the Little business and Little family. He won’t have Koch$$ & BIG BANK & BIG OIL$$$.  HIS PASSION IS NOT Corrupt
1351 2018-07-14 20:35:36 generally skin is more oily if you skip moisturizer because your skin is trying to compensate the dryness by creating more oil!!
1352 2018-07-14 20:35:27 @seanhannity has no shame for the lies he tells and the shit he peddles. Snake oil salesman
1353 2018-07-14 20:35:25 Buying the smaller bottle of olive oil and less paper towels knowing we won’t be here in a month. #mixedemotionsclub
1354 2018-07-14 20:35:25 This what they serving if you dont change your own oil
1355 2018-07-14 20:35:21 Lhh Cam bro, use coconut oil, pussy, and a wash it frequently but wtw
1356 2018-07-14 20:35:01 Never going to happen until an end to Citizens United and all of these ancient oil barons get their money out of politics!
1357 2018-07-14 20:34:57 Yeah I’m imagining like coconut oil lol
1358 2018-07-14 20:34:31 Soybean oil primarily. Or other cheap inflammatory oils.
1359 2018-07-14 20:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
1360 2018-07-14 20:34:16 Not really sure. But here in the states they also have CBD oil. Something like that. So it doesn't get you high but can relax you. Or get vapes without nicotine.

1362 2018-07-14 20:34:08 Thank you.  Meeting a navy pilot stationed around the world with hand on experience in the oil & gas industry was an honor and a pleasure
1363 2018-07-14 20:34:07 the entire top of his head is so scaly and he has little patches on his forehead/eyebrows too  i hope the oil works for him!
1364 2018-07-14 20:34:03 DID ANYONE GET IT THAT JEFF SESSIONS AG IS FROM BIG OIL??  WHY SHOULD BROWN GET INVOLVED IN A FIGHT W BIG OIL  WHEN HE IS RETIRING SOON!

1368 2018-07-14 20:33:49 Wait the car place that did oil changes?
1369 2018-07-14 20:33:48 The truffle shuffle love truffles added to Mac & cheese its the best they have truffle dust or truffle oil but hey bacon works too
1370 2018-07-14 20:33:42 I also remember she wanted us to get her some oil.
1371 2018-07-14 20:33:39 I didn’t vote Trump but 1/2 of what you are arguing are empty points. Our Allies will still depend on us. Tariffs won’t impact as it will be negotiated. Oil prices went up and down under Obama. In fact, in CA, Democrats passed additional taxes for environmental issues.
1372 2018-07-14 20:33:36 Big corps wanted it prohibited as it was destroying their profits, big pharma, oil, cotton producers etc got together to convince Harry Aislinger to make up that story. Racism was skyrocketing and they knew that wd scare ppl into not using cannabis. And it worked unfortunately
1373 2018-07-14 20:33:35 Trashing  Paris Accords &  EPA, to fatten big oil and coal at the expense of public health,, raising tariffs that benefit a few at the expense of many, trying to kill the ACA so a few  middlemen can again pick everyone elses pockets, selling out SS etc. to make  fat cats purr...
1374 2018-07-14 20:33:18 When I search lube, I always get a coupon for an oil change & a happy ending. Lucas Oil really treats their customers right these days.
1375 2018-07-14 20:32:49 We need leaders in Texas who cares for the people over big oil and special interest #BetoForTexas
1376 2018-07-14 20:32:48 If you don't think he's got his hands in big oil's pockets then your the one who needs meds. He's a businessman. His supporters are all swearing he's not making a dime while he's president....bullcrap.

1380 2018-07-14 20:32:25 Additionally ME principles will after Russia leaves crush Iran which Puttin would like to see Iranian oil cut off again driving price up and we will not be involved much(awacs refuel drones SF) that will suit Trump’s no war stance.
1381 2018-07-14 20:32:25 Olive oil is life
1382 2018-07-14 20:32:20 What the Oil Companies did about Climate change, and it’s exactly what the Russians are doing NOW with everything they can think of ... !
1383 2018-07-14 20:32:15 -HOT-

-removes dirt, oil, and build up

-causes frizz

-makes hair dye fade faster

-causes dry & brittle hair
1384 2018-07-14 20:32:14 We will be MORE dependent long term if we do not manage our resources conservatively. Exporting oil is acceptable short term for the economic stimulus, not long term. 
@realDonaldTrump
1385 2018-07-14 20:32:03 Great day at the #daybreakfarmersmarket! It will be awesome when more produce is being harvested. I also love the artisans and other local merchants as well! Picked up some Comice Pear White Balsamic infused Olive Oil from Redstone Olive Oil from @Redstoneolive. So good!
1386 2018-07-14 20:32:01 getting an oil change < changing your car’s diaper
1387 2018-07-14 20:31:48 I know you aren't that bright, but I thought that even you would understand that the taxes on goods would increase as the cost of thoses goods increase. Oil has risen by 65% in the last year. If you work in O&G, great news. Anyone else, all prices creep.
1388 2018-07-14 20:31:30 Mylas was horrrible. I put oil on it at bed time and it’s starting to look better
1389 2018-07-14 20:31:29 I didn’t the fish oil ending after not knowing what it was Andrea losing 3 hrs of progress
1390 2018-07-14 20:31:26 It's necessary so America does not repeat same mistake come November, because these "snake oil salesmen politicians" are so slick, they are capable of pulling off another stunt, if we let them.
1391 2018-07-14 20:31:21 someone has been sucking on oil and gas pipelines for too long.

obviously.
1392 2018-07-14 20:30:57 So I’m getting my oil changed and homeboy comes at me asking questions about car parts, but with the attitude of “this bitch doesn’t know anything about cars.” His look of shock when I did was priceless. #comeatmebro #dontjudgeabookbyitscover
1393 2018-07-14 20:30:56 I tried cbd oil on my acne and it worked amazing
1394 2018-07-14 20:30:52 Having a bunch of oil money is usually counterindicated for good governance though.

And Finland is alright without the massive wealth

1399 2018-07-14 20:29:53 gah! no, they used 9/11 as an excuse to attack Iraq for oil.
1400 2018-07-14 20:29:38 The San Francisco judge (of all places) threw out the case against the oil companies and environmental wakos 
1401 2018-07-14 20:29:35 are we not at risk? Whose sons & daughters fight that fight if there is one?  We can have that same trade leverage globally & at the same time, as an alliance, protect vital sectors from protagonists. Oil, gas, steel, etc. These r of equal value and strategic importance as arms
1402 2018-07-14 20:29:29 Any way you can do hemp oil?  In a pen?
1403 2018-07-14 20:29:23 Stfu whilst living in the state with all those oil exec’s
1404 2018-07-14 20:29:11 We have a winner, folks.  Oil is the answer.  Winner moves to semi-finals.
1405 2018-07-14 20:29:07 I’m all for an end to the perpetual oil wars. At the same time, why trade bad for bad? Why welcome the risks that come with offshore drilling? Offshore drilling endangers Gulf ecosystems and fisheries; negatively impacts beach tourism, and oil dependence furthers climate change.
1406 2018-07-14 20:29:04 Lol I made brown rice and then I added a little bit of olive oil, a little garlic and then some pink Himalayan salt it was amazing 
1407 2018-07-14 20:28:51 Thems good eaten'!
1408 2018-07-14 20:28:32 @thegobbledegook Dorset oil well venting methane.... think you can come up with suitable protest pants?! (Seriously)
1409 2018-07-14 20:28:29 He was right... It used to be Rice, vegetable oil etc (food stuff) they use to share, physical money sharing stated in Edo by APC....
What they share before are food gifts... APC is a curse to #Nigeria
1410 2018-07-14 20:28:16 Did a charcoal face mask & a deep sea mineral face mask. Then took a bath with Epsom salts, lavender oil, and bubbles. You could say I'm pretty relaxed 
1411 2018-07-14 20:27:52 omg thank you so much! and would it be best to use a cleanser and an oil cleanser? or like one in the morning and one at night?
1412 2018-07-14 20:27:42 My mom made food using coconut oil.
I wonder if she really didn’t know I was allergic or if she just hates me and wants to kill me.
1413 2018-07-14 20:27:31 Ignore those rapidly falling wait times for a Model 3. Fake news. Obviously a plant from Big Oil/Koch Brothers/Shorts. $TSLA
1414 2018-07-14 20:27:29 *me buying car oil & a new filter with no real idea of what I'm doing except what my dad told me*
Guy trying too hard to hit on me:  wow a girl who actually knows about cars, that's impressive
1415 2018-07-14 20:27:22 Come by and grab a DOSE oil tanker today! They are on sale!
1416 2018-07-14 20:27:11 Well considering they are fighting over oil distribution to Europe with Russia, I'd say Obama had a very hard time and Trump has it made. He does what the Kremlin says.
1417 2018-07-14 20:27:01 i’m sad knowing i’ll never be able to eat chik fil a because they cook with peanut oil like I wanna know why everyone raves about their food :’(
1418 2018-07-14 20:26:53 I’m not a fan of double cleansing at all. Unless you’re a heavy makeup wearer. It’s unnecessary otherwise and you’re undoing the benefits and entire purpose of the oil cleanser. Can’t wait to consult with you!
1419 2018-07-14 20:26:44 Ngl, until I saw "boiling oil" half way through, I was like, "oh hmm, weird, but this guy knows what he-"
1420 2018-07-14 20:26:41 Holy mackerel!!!
1421 2018-07-14 20:25:27 Are these the sardines that are canned with olive oil?
1422 2018-07-14 20:25:20 dos mamarrachos queriéndose hacer los new rich pero igual destilan oil
1423 2018-07-14 20:25:18 Now that's disappointing. His Teslas are anathema to the "GOP stands by big oil & coal" platform. Maybe he liked that tax break.
1424 2018-07-14 20:25:16 May decree spending should only be equivalent to a 10 Dollar oil price increase. My understanding of budget rule: Oil dollars from 40+ go to reserves. Additional spending needed -> increase debt. Debt and reserves both grow.
1425 2018-07-14 20:25:14 Show up with a plan? This isn’t George Bush. 

Why are we paying for a trip? 
What is the goal? A couple hours of “private time?”
Will he sell our National Parks for oil? 
Give him Ukraine?
Sell the children?

If you don’t know either, it might be time to use your outside  voice.
1426 2018-07-14 20:25:10 Now, couple that with the unexpectedly rapid rise of the renewable energy industry (for example half of BP research is in renewables) and gas/coal/oil producers are watching their industry, as primary power sources, literally dry up.
1427 2018-07-14 20:24:59 Saudis and the petro dollar is no longer working, high oil and gas prices are what can lose GOP the midterm and prick the everything bubble
1428 2018-07-14 20:24:50 Should be doing an oil change. The only problem is not wanting to be underneath a car at the moment.
1429 2018-07-14 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1430 2018-07-14 20:24:28 Could be some sort of mite or caterpillar. Try spraying your plant (and soaking the soil) with neem oil. You should be able to get that in any garden center.
1431 2018-07-14 20:24:17 So we form policy, elect leaders based on what people in other countries think or assemblage of a mob? No.
What should we do on Death to America day in Iran? Huge crowds show up for that.
1432 2018-07-14 20:24:07 @OverItAll7 Monique is really going to act like she can equal Chris's earnings selling geranium oil to women who are even dumber than she is? #RHOP I picture a future of lawsuits like that baby who died b/c his dumb parents treated him with maple syrup.
1433 2018-07-14 20:24:06 Send me like 50 dollars. I need a inspection done of my car actually send me like 75 dollars. I need a oil change too.
1434 2018-07-14 20:24:05 U don't know what you're missing. iWas like u just a week ago until iDared myself. It's one of the best foods on earth. Use the other oil they serve with beans not this red one and add some avocado. Thank me later
1435 2018-07-14 20:23:51 No not even. $12.50 at most because unskilled workers do not deserve the same pay as someone who has a skill. Even better keep the oil wells online. Those without work could do that.
1436 2018-07-14 20:23:13 Can my guy just get back to me so I can get some oil and dab myself into sleep
1437 2018-07-14 20:23:12 They are pretty good and you don’t use oil so it much healthier
1438 2018-07-14 20:23:06 I'm not sure how well a 5k/month CBD oil is actually going to sell given you can get similar products for pennies on the dollar.

No differentiation here except some insurance reimbursements due to FDA approval

Real work will be tailoring strains to specific conditions
1439 2018-07-14 20:22:58 Bob holly or baby oil
1440 2018-07-14 20:22:31 No, but seriously energy producers — as you look at their FEC reports — represent (collectively) about $85M in total donations (that’s probably on the low end too.). The problem for oil companies now isn’t a question of refinement - it’s supply.
1441 2018-07-14 20:22:14 Land has no true turnover rate, since it is a property of nature, not capital/labor. The optimal rate for land is 100%, and 0% for almost everything else, although you might be able to make case for very low rates on capital like oil refineries. Ramsey & Stiglitz explained on why
1442 2018-07-14 20:22:12 If there’s a best friend that would paint that with Aquarell colors or even oil.... or make that cell shading :-) woot woot :-)
1443 2018-07-14 20:22:11 *hugs* oh no! ;-; I hope you feel better by tomorrow, that oil must've been blehh xd
1444 2018-07-14 20:22:00 Need some oil for your walker?
1445 2018-07-14 20:21:43 when my skin is going through it i use the body shop tea tree face wash and toner, but then a good moisturizer so it doesn't dry out too bad from the tea tree oil in the stuff
1446 2018-07-14 20:21:39 Dearest Moonbeam,

Today was living hell. The pong of patchouly oil hung in the air like mortar fog. The carnage was bloodcurdling as discarded Starbucks Ventis riddled the streets amid sticky pools of latte. 

Snapchat down.

1451 2018-07-14 20:20:14 Uh oil?!? 
Under Obama US gas companies could not drill in Russia.   
Trump ´fixed’ it, now they can. 
Simple
1452 2018-07-14 20:20:14 Dream on!  There is no evidence that Asia cares about our #tarsands oil.  Theyhave better sources for cleaner stuff closer to home.  If there were a market, the tankers would be going there now. They are not. #bcpoli #cdnpoli

1454 2018-07-14 20:19:52 Getting my oil changed and the mechanic asked me a question and I said “I literally don’t know what any of those words mean” Perpetuating female stereotypes one overcharged oil change at a time 
1455 2018-07-14 20:19:45 What you're seeing is not peanut-based, but a mixture of oil and crumbs that resembles peanut butter. Regular Ritz Crackers do not contain peanut butter. Would you please send us a DM with the UPC, expiration date, and the letters and numbers that follow? Thanks!
1456 2018-07-14 20:19:39 I took my car to get a FREE oil change today & ended up having to pay $80 for something else that needed replacing 
1457 2018-07-14 20:19:35 @KimVanderkelen @senrobportman But it's OK for Obama's old campaign team to be sent to Israel to defeat Bibi in last election?!

1464 2018-07-14 20:18:23 That seafood rice from those people by West Indies oil field was heavenly 
1465 2018-07-14 20:18:23 Chris mad in the car about being late and your oil temp lmaoooo
1466 2018-07-14 20:18:19 Almost every one of my shirts n cargo shorts have some sort of an oil stain on em.
1467 2018-07-14 20:18:16 Mom caught me vaping the canola oil now I’m grounded from the kitchen
1468 2018-07-14 20:18:07 How does an oil change turn into a trade up to a new car? #cars #smh
1469 2018-07-14 20:17:55 Single car accident at Bawnmore cross, road very slippy, oil spillage. Please be careful on approach from both dirctions

1471 2018-07-14 20:17:45 Not quite sure what sun cream is. Do you mean like sunblock? Maybe try baby oil or sun tan oil on your shins only?
1472 2018-07-14 20:17:43 Have you actually ever DONE any of the labor you say is 'easy' to extract and process resources?

Have you ever wielded a shovel? Dug a trench all day long to lay in a pipe to carry water or oil products? Have you ever driven a truck all day to carry ore?
1473 2018-07-14 20:17:35 Arms sales, banks, and oil may have a lot more to do with the Repubs reaction to Trump treachery than we will ever know.

1474 2018-07-14 20:17:33 We know this. Tillerson had no experience as SoS. But he wanted to drill, baby, drill. Obama's sanctions for invasion of Ukraine and Crimea by Russia nixed their plans. 
There are multiple reasons. Because everyone wants a piece.
Racism, oil, religion, one party control...
1475 2018-07-14 20:17:23 No like it tightens but it’s still hydrated me because I don’t get as oily since my skin doesn’t feel like it needs to produce more oil
1476 2018-07-14 20:17:04 Oh lol my bad. Its good indeed. Better for Animals&the planet too,&our health on top of that. You should give it a try you can look up other recipies online too. Honestly I dont remember seeing a home made Vegan cheese recipie with oil, it's usually store bought that does that
1477 2018-07-14 20:17:00 Chef Skinner cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with hot sauce.
1478 2018-07-14 20:16:59 Average male between 18-29 can't even do a oil change. Don debate me pls
1479 2018-07-14 20:16:43 You get your oil changed there?
1480 2018-07-14 20:16:10 I liked the oil cleanser! My skin however seemed to be more prone to little acne after double cleansing n following through with my night routine thanks boo, I def do!!!
1481 2018-07-14 20:15:59 Or The Donald could tell the Saudi's to flood the petroleum markets & drive down the price oil & natural gas thereby bankrupting the Russians. But that won't happen because the Russians own The Donald. What don't you get?
1482 2018-07-14 20:15:56 The picture of a woman hanging by her neck is not a “bad taste” joke. I’ve supplied several other examples now, of rape, death, hot oil etc however a woman hanging should have been condemned instantly so I think we’re done here. Have a good evening

1487 2018-07-14 20:15:13 Solid info. You miss the part of Nwoye + oil magnate handshake with IPOB to see to election date extension.
1488 2018-07-14 20:15:04 Sometimes it’s clumpy for me and sometimes it’s not. If it’s clumpy sometimes I add some drops of coconut oil or olive oil in the mascara bottle & that seems to help a bit!
1489 2018-07-14 20:14:42 I thought this was an oil painting at first. Holy Gods Above and Below this is amazing.
1490 2018-07-14 20:14:39 There is to much expansion&money being invested for it2fail right now &only a few country’s that mass produce farm food so American farmers are gonna make out better,cause they feed the world not the oil company’s!Why is oil more expensive than food ?
1491 2018-07-14 20:14:36 Rather than place faith in the name of Jesus, they would believe that using water from orioke or oil from Jerusalem would bring them blessings and favour
1492 2018-07-14 20:14:35 @chevrolet 
He called me later on in the day and said it is not covered because there is sludge in my engine due to low or no maintenance. This will run me about 8,000 (I’m rounding). My father does all oil changes and tune ups, he has replaced many parts of my car as well sooo
1493 2018-07-14 20:14:33 everything has hella oil and fat but it tastes so good :/
1494 2018-07-14 20:13:59 Things I notice now about airports in America? They try to squeeze every inch of space to create points of sale for something, anything. No wonder the gates are always overflowing. Most of them stink of old cooking oil. It makes me nautious now.
1495 2018-07-14 20:13:58 Go to gparents for olive oil end up doing 5hrs of yard work

1511 2018-07-14 20:12:25 Haha olive oil talaga? Pede rin
1512 2018-07-14 20:12:22 Got it. The US, being the largest consumer of oil, that would make sense. He misworded it, meaning producer vs exporter? You would have to ask him.
1513 2018-07-14 20:12:13 Why is my dad at a pool club, while I’m getting my oil changed? I ain’t doing something right.
1514 2018-07-14 20:12:04 It showed you how complicated it is for the average fan who thinks they could do better. Words like Ice, sand, oil, says to the centre when to snap the ball. Numbers means how many receivers, protection and routes to the offence. What is means to 1 team is different for another.
1515 2018-07-14 20:11:47 What didn’t you like about oil cleansers? You know where to find me when you’re ready! 
1516 2018-07-14 20:11:43 I was wrong. Though this is curious.

1523 2018-07-14 20:10:51 Snake oil. I tried it for my chronic pain and found it to be quite useless.
1524 2018-07-14 20:10:49 I tried oil cleansing n felt like my skin didn’t take to it...but cleansers I use now are just...my whole routine is trashim refraining from asking for specific help till I make my appt but my face is suffering
1525 2018-07-14 20:10:31 I cook with coconut oil
1526 2018-07-14 20:10:26 i got rid of my bump in a week - use tea tree oil on it once a day and DONT TOUCH IT !!! like don't pick crust or anything don't touch jt at all
1527 2018-07-14 20:10:15 Container lines, insurers, refineries, oil customers, essentially every business in the world besides the People's Republic of China would appear to be terminitating business with IRI but it is the US that is isolated.  Right....
1528 2018-07-14 20:10:11 As if it wasn't annoying enough
1529 2018-07-14 20:10:10 Right! I don’t know how she even got it out in the first place she kept saying it hurt. And she screamed when she got it pierced. And she never cleaned it! She is lucky I guess. After I got it changed out I only use tea tree oil on it.

1532 2018-07-14 20:10:01 Oil from Greece traps is the worst most vile substance we produce in homes and restaurants. No, can't go in the trash or drain. If you can find a solution  to dispose of it appropriately you will be a very rich man in no time.
1533 2018-07-14 20:09:59 Of course I know a little about car maintenance, but very little. I can change a flat time, add oil, check the battery, but that’s pretty much it.

You know what's stupid filling?
Homemade almond/coconut butter.
I'm a happy bee.
1537 2018-07-14 20:09:29 Was watching the Ace Family’s new video while getting my oil changed and the guy who worked on my car was part of the family toooo @CatherinePaiz @AustinMcbroom #acefamily
1538 2018-07-14 20:09:22 Finding out from my @StanfordGSB course that actually most of the oil and gas companies support a carbon tax! Why does the world not know this? But knowing it is critical -- there won't be opposition from them. Let's make it happen!
1539 2018-07-14 20:08:38 History is littered with examples of ppl that did good, then they didn't. Why are dems obstructing and defending him in hearings? 
Every one of them act like they represent him as lawyers. Just answer questions and let the facts come out.
1540 2018-07-14 20:08:33 is going to sell this as his rally during the next speech.
1541 2018-07-14 20:08:27 Can we blame gas prices on collusion too? Oil speculation is going through the roof again, even though Trump said he’d lower gas prices  Don’t Donald and Vlad have major investments in oil? 
1542 2018-07-14 20:08:20 I was thinking this more than oil being used for his production (as I'd imagine that Elon would rather not use fossil fuels when possible but idk)
1543 2018-07-14 20:08:20 I’m getting an oil change and I’m tellin them to check my car all around. 
Pray this poor college student doesn’t find out her car is dying
1544 2018-07-14 20:08:17 That's a typical lefty answer , throw more money at it & let all those cheapskate EU parasites get away with paying for their own protection, while they sign multi billion gas & oil deals with the same country NATO is there to protect them from, EU =  Fur coat & no knickers
1545 2018-07-14 20:08:15 We need to market a “snake essential oil” and see how long it takes them to catch on
1546 2018-07-14 20:07:53 Olive oil.
1547 2018-07-14 20:07:34 Jiffy Lube getting an oil change & the lady in the waiting room heard me ask for conventional oil so when I sat down she walked over to me and handed me a $12 off coupon because she gets synthetic and wanted it to go to good use. There really are still good people in the world.
1548 2018-07-14 20:07:33 Why do “healthy” places use canola oil in their dressings? @MandysSalads @AuxVivres
1549 2018-07-14 20:07:24 Here we go another snake oil salesman, Only fools would believe anything this conman has to say!!!! #cdnpoli
1550 2018-07-14 20:07:17 Oh no. France UK Israel Saudi Jordan turkey NATO ... All got bloody hands. Filthy bloody oil stained hands.
1551 2018-07-14 20:07:06 When getting an oil change turns into getting a new tire
1552 2018-07-14 20:06:49 depressing. I just want chicken tenders fried in peanut oil.
1553 2018-07-14 20:06:48 Let me get some oil and fry up this fish
1554 2018-07-14 20:06:17 ふぁいとぅ！
1555 2018-07-14 20:06:15 Power.  For Putin it is getting back the Baltic countries he still considers to be the true Russian Empire.  He sees himself as the King of Oil world-wide.  $$$$$ drives Trump.
1556 2018-07-14 20:05:58 same with Gowdy.  He stood behind the Mueller investigation for a minute.

It's either blackmail, they were colluding too, FOX contract, or just the #EntitledEvangelicalElite don't want their money sources (arms, banks, oil..) compromised.

1562 2018-07-14 20:05:03 Baking slices with tomatoes, onions, parmesan, olive oil, it's an Italian dish. The acid in the tomatoes cause the potatoes to cook very slowly and not have the same texture we're used to. Tastes good though.
1563 2018-07-14 20:05:00 He actually wants to go on an oil rig. And he'd especially like to have an assignment overseas if possible.
1564 2018-07-14 20:04:56 Probably don't make any deals especially deals about oil&oil related things, Russia need the oil price to be up and up and up
1565 2018-07-14 20:04:55 that's great news, they should also register IRGC a terrorist group and freeze all their assets.
In addition to Oil sanctions, they should put sanctions on all Iranian trades.
1566 2018-07-14 20:04:53 Triggered over what
That Car owners cant switch their own spark plugs and change their own oil on there car, and need others to do it for them cause its too much work and rather have a mechanic do there work for them for a low profit.
Yeah same, triggered......
1567 2018-07-14 20:04:40 I diffuse Bergamot Essential Oil while doing yoga or Pilates. Love it!! It’s very calming & relaxing.
1568 2018-07-14 20:04:37 Why should the people of the U.K. care what that loser of a trash-bag Steve Bannon says?   Bannon lost what little credibility he ever had in the US, so now he’s going overseas  to sell his disgusting snake oil? #deplorable

1572 2018-07-14 20:03:23 Seriously?? Wow man. So you think all this drilling and doing away with cleaner resources like solar energy is ok? The only reason he said it was a myth is bc he's in the oil industry. Open your eyes man. Look at all the oil heads in his cabinet.
1573 2018-07-14 20:03:23 Who wants to change my oil? I’ll pay you!!!!
1574 2018-07-14 20:03:13 I can tell you don't read very much, so I'll let you know that during the years of the Obama administration domestic oil production went up.  Fuel prices did level off.  The economy steadily became stronger.
1575 2018-07-14 20:03:00 I find that lavender oil applied sparingly, although not necessarily solving the problem, makes the problem slightly more bearable. Will try some IPA later and report back
1576 2018-07-14 20:02:55 Currently I have on baby oil and tanning oil all over my skin pray my skin won't fall off please
1577 2018-07-14 20:02:49 Yes and she is 22 & It's a battle keeping weight on her but she is queen of the farm. Plenty of Apples, & carrots. Besides her medication, She also gets vitamin E oil, & the supplement Sam-E 200mg mixed in applesauce, and Beet Pulp soaked in water 2 hours before feedings. 

1578 2018-07-14 20:02:32 That doesn't make sense, those people would rather have oil than clean energy, and theres know way he can out-lobby the oil companies. How would this benefit him at all?
1579 2018-07-14 20:02:27 I said that there's not enough of him on TV boiling in oil. That distinction is important.

1586 2018-07-14 20:01:53 Let us act as if the Netherlands were not apart of the slave trade. Or HK & Singapore don’t sit on some of the biggest oil reserves... Again, what does this have to do with America? Which was topic at hand. 1/2
1587 2018-07-14 20:01:52 no it hasnt. and having control would make no difference. GERS includes all oil revenues for scotland and we still receive £10bn from rUK at the moment. growth commission uses GERS figures BTW
1588 2018-07-14 20:01:49 In NAFTA Canada should drop guaranteeing the US shared  access to our oil/gas in case of of supply emergency. They don't need the guarantee and besides, we are a security concern so they would not want to be reliant on us.

1591 2018-07-14 20:01:14 @VossNegotiation I used the techniques today when I stopped by a scooter store to pick up a trunk I bought, but found out the shipping had been delayed, again. Ended up getting the trunk for free and a free oil change , not once did I make an offer.
1592 2018-07-14 20:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or – and who we are fighting for.
1593 2018-07-14 20:01:07 Since day one this has been about the sanctions. The oil deal with Tillerson and Putin. Alaska. You are not fooling anyone but your fact ignorant base which is dwindling fast. People tell me they think you are a liar and are leaving you.
1594 2018-07-14 20:00:51 I never do that. 
You must have a WWII potato that hasn’t been defused.
Olive oil and salt for me.
Pop a marrow in the microwave instead.

1610 2018-07-14 19:58:57 Funny how people bitch about how much gas cost, so much goes into finding oil, pumping it out of the ground, shipping, refining, more shipping. Yet they will gladly pay around the same, usually more, for water that the bottling company gets for free and may or may not even filter
1611 2018-07-14 19:58:50 And none of us question anything. Just keep shovelling the food down our faces and slopping arse oil all over ourselves.
1612 2018-07-14 19:58:48 Insects such a no brainer... been looking at similar set up to feed my Aquaponics system.... would love to close the loop. Soy & palm oil should be handled like conflict minerals given the harm they do.

1623 2018-07-14 19:58:07 Interesting. Well it has. And you're right it's mainly due to oil- it would be repeated if we'd had control over those revenues like independent Norway though - right?

1631 2018-07-14 19:55:43 My understanding of the new budget policy for 2019-21 is that the budget rule for oil has basically been relaxed from $40/b to around $60/b to fund the May Decree. But they don't make this very clear in the document...

1646 2018-07-14 19:53:30 i would say that the only reason it could be possible was because of high oil revenues in the past. that can never be repeated because of the increased costs for extraction due to the maturing of the oil fields.

1666 2018-07-14 19:51:46 Very misleading. We didn’t have the per cap money from oil that Norway has. I think you should do a bit more studying in the costs of setting up a new country. You seemed to have missed a few zeros.
1667 2018-07-14 19:51:42 Slices of aubergine, mushrooms, sweetcorn, halved courgettes, simply brushed with olive oil & grilled.
1668 2018-07-14 19:51:37 Trump: poor people should drown in giant pools full of oil. 

Trump supporters: ...

Trump: oil from the good ol U. S. of A! 

TS: hooray!

1670 2018-07-14 19:51:20 Thank you for pointing this out. I find that DE's reliance on RU's oil & gas surprises a lot of people, even Germans.
1671 2018-07-14 19:51:00 @kaiiipower oil me up real quick
1672 2018-07-14 19:50:55 There is lots of opportunity down east beside fisheries and farming. (oil & gas) But for some reason the Irving’s and gov wont allow exploration. There is a bit in NB. I feel equalization is also a part of it.  Gas wells were drilled on PEI but were forced to cement them in.
1673 2018-07-14 19:50:51 This was the whole point of our conversation. You dont need oil to make cheese. Also the case with vegab cheese. Take those ingrediants, pop them in a blender. Voilà. The Nutritional Yeast and Garlic give it a cheesy taste. Cashews are sweet&creamy. No oil needed.
1674 2018-07-14 19:50:35 Lol I love how people compete with each other like it’s the “environmental olympics”. 
Like oh you only use reusable straws??
“Why aren’t you vegan? Are you boycotting soy and palm oil products?”
“Do you only buy food and items in bulk?”
“Do you drive a smart car?”
.....
Like YO
1675 2018-07-14 19:50:34 @QuakerState My favorite part was the oil change game #QS400 #SOCKRACE245

1680 2018-07-14 19:50:06 was supposed to get an oil change today but this summer cold has sapped my will
1681 2018-07-14 19:50:02 Do you use baby oil or anything like that?

1683 2018-07-14 19:49:55 Coconut oil help
I'm gonna use coconut oil in a cake but it's so warm that the oil is as thin as water, should I put it in the refrigerator before using or doesn't it matter??
It's says on the glass that it's normal but Idk what's best when it comes to cake making Hahah
1684 2018-07-14 19:49:33 AS with the theft of our fish by EU fishermen, foreigners are pumping Scottish oil as we type. It is discussions with Norway that needs to be opened.
1685 2018-07-14 19:49:19 Who got oil for a nissan altima Im not tryna buy none 
1686 2018-07-14 19:49:16 cannabutter/cannasugar =  distilled oil and wax edibles = 
1687 2018-07-14 19:49:14 yes but also
1688 2018-07-14 19:49:11 Yes. Read Ben Dachis' study in which he placed a representative well in a variety of N.A. jurisdictions. Dachis: "emissions compliance costs are trivial" as a competitive issue. Also, oil sands heavy crude doesn't compete with shale light sweet crude. Maybe he meant Venezuela
1689 2018-07-14 19:49:08 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
1690 2018-07-14 19:49:06 I'm amused at the media for claiming that Germany getting 35% of its energy needs from Russia does NOT make it dependent on Russia, and then turning around and claiming the U.S. is dependent on Saudi Arabia for oil when the U.S. gets 8.1% of its oil from Saudi Arabia. Really?
1691 2018-07-14 19:48:55 Pumpkin & butternut chunks, parboiled, tossed while warm in coconut oil, chilli flakes, ground cumin & coriander.
1692 2018-07-14 19:48:46 Thirdly, I would be willing to give up the military industrial monster that I pay for as well as the continual tax giveaways given to oil companies and the uber wealthy...

1704 2018-07-14 19:46:56 Chef Louis cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with sushi.

1706 2018-07-14 19:46:38 When a man ask you if you know how to cook ask them if they know how do an oil change? Do they know how to fix things around the house? Watch how quick they get quiet.
1707 2018-07-14 19:46:34 Idk why frying certain foods in peanut oil is so fire but whew
1708 2018-07-14 19:46:25 色々停滞しているので立て直したいですね…
1709 2018-07-14 19:46:01 ...I'm not sure about that...as far as I'm aware used cooking oil is bio-degradable, so there's no risk in throwing it in the trash, but surely if we can recycle it into fuel we should..? Logically, we have to head towards recycling 100%...
1710 2018-07-14 19:45:58 Germany should get 0 percent of their natural gas and crude oil from Russia
1711 2018-07-14 19:45:20 I bet if oil wells were being poached something would be done. Absolutely horrible !

1718 2018-07-14 19:44:13 We have stop bombing and destabilizing the the world for oil and gas revenue and trying to force our bent democracy on the rest of the world .let them get there on there own under there own steam
1719 2018-07-14 19:44:11 We recommend cleansing the coconut oil from the hair before using Olaplex.

1722 2018-07-14 19:43:23 An eternal fart is the gift that keeps giving... better than an oil field 
1723 2018-07-14 19:43:20 snow got an oil change, tire rotation, car wash, vacuum & a full tank she badddddd 
1724 2018-07-14 19:43:14 buy some Jamaican Black Castor oil or grape seed oil and massage your scalp with it daily. Castor oil is heavy so be generous with it
1725 2018-07-14 19:43:14 For government to take over healthcare 100%, the same argument can be made for any industry. The basic premise is Marxist. 
Bernie really would extend this to running Disneyland or Walmart. Government knows best.
1726 2018-07-14 19:42:46 omg are complimentary scents ok?? i don't want to mess w ur chakra but when my bubbles pop they release scents related to my mood & while i have some control over it, i can't promise every bubble will be the same lavender oil as urs.  i rly dont want this to ruin our friendship
1727 2018-07-14 19:42:44 I actually don't care for his stuff, it does seem to target men primarily but no I wouldn't call him a snake oil salesmen just someone who sees the human animal for what it is and describes it harshly.
1728 2018-07-14 19:42:35 Right when I’m building my savings account back up my powerstroke starts leaking oil 
1729 2018-07-14 19:42:28 unfortunately for Liberals Canada can't offer an alternative supply of LNG or oil.
1730 2018-07-14 19:42:28 Last winter, our house, NI, ran out of heating oil, 2 bloody months......

1735 2018-07-14 19:42:01 when it feels like 88° and your coconut oil lotion melts the fuck off 
1736 2018-07-14 19:42:00 No the oil companies are ripping us off!
1737 2018-07-14 19:41:53 It seems strange that in a city with so much oil that the oil company cannot bring power generators to supply  electricity into the region. Where is their commitment to the people?
1738 2018-07-14 19:41:53 Bad news, my beard oil opened up in my toiletry bag. 

Good news, I can now use my toothbrush for my mustache and sideburns.
1739 2018-07-14 19:41:44 Dude yes....... also like the stove will be “cleaned” but then I look closer and there’s a layer of OIL EVERYWHERE OMG
1740 2018-07-14 19:41:27 Just started taking CBD oil today. Initial thoughts... interesting taste.
1741 2018-07-14 19:41:08 And the oil? Cashews, carrots, potatoes, garlic, and onion sounds like a meal unto itself.
1742 2018-07-14 19:40:55 Thing is we have more than enough resources to go around, they're all just being concentrated too much at the top. And we're too dependent on finite resources like oil etc, but that's a whole different conversation

1749 2018-07-14 19:40:04 Family Nutrition: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this July? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
1750 2018-07-14 19:39:58 Why are you bringing oil into this?  What is your farming expertise?
1751 2018-07-14 19:39:49 #4 is pretty much what Trump said to NATO leaders about them supporting Russian oil and gas.

1755 2018-07-14 19:39:36 Today looks like it’s gonna be a boring ass day. . I went to go change my oil and came back in the house.
1756 2018-07-14 19:39:34 36 billion barrels of oil and you’re still pushing volcanoes, you live a sad life.
1757 2018-07-14 19:39:32 It is an issue when Trump LIES. 
Germany only buys about 8% of their natural gas from Russia which in no way makes them dependent on anyone. 
What Trump really wants is sell American oil but Merkel is no fool, she knows better than to make deals with the orange schoolyard bully
1758 2018-07-14 19:39:06 no it hasnt. it has been a net receiver. currently £10bn extra per annum. why have you chosen only 40 years? oil perhaps?
1759 2018-07-14 19:38:50 See, right wingers only want to believe fox news, (since right wingers hate people who try to actually do something good and useful, especially if it upsets big oil), so I provided you a source that suits your leanings. 

But nice factual reply. I see facts still hurt, hey?
1760 2018-07-14 19:38:49 The Russian assault on USA democracy is only part of the assult that Treasouns Don & GOP conduct on democracy.

1. Voter suppression laws
2. Republican Gerrymandering
3. Special interest groups buying politicians...NRA/Oil 
4. President puckering on Putin’s Pecker
1761 2018-07-14 19:38:39 I think the change to the splitter, spoiler, and oil pan, after they'd already finalized design around previous aero package, is what's taking so long to catch up. Ford and Toyota had more background info on body to try and figure aero package from, Chevy had no on track...
1762 2018-07-14 19:38:38 Whisking olive oil into a vinaigrette has been a revelation. I'm sad I'm so late to the Nora Ephron party but better late than never #Heartburn #InspirationalWomen #LaughOutLoud
1763 2018-07-14 19:38:28 What happens when you mix oil for your car and sugar..moxie!
1764 2018-07-14 19:38:26 I think for a lot of Dems they're waking up to the fact that tech barons are no more enlightened than oil barons. Just cause he makes some cool s**t doesn't make Musk cool.
1765 2018-07-14 19:38:09 #Limerick royalty at the very least.
Here’s one of mine 

The niece of a testy old royal
Carelessly splashed him with oil
The choleric uncle
Became a carbuncle
Though commoners called him a boil 

Not about you, obvs... 
1766 2018-07-14 19:37:51 So all the guys at the oil change place are calling me brother and dude and boss and I’m just 
1767 2018-07-14 19:37:50 Getting a oil change Monday 
1768 2018-07-14 19:37:36 There should be a constitutional exam before you can run for any office, but of course the Dems would cheat
1769 2018-07-14 19:37:27 This man in the kitchen with you while you're cooking is all fun and games until hot oil splashes on your fine thighs and you have to explain to your mother why you were cooking naked in the first place.

I'm just saying. Not like it happened to me or anything.
1770 2018-07-14 19:37:20 Do you think our butts become dark because we don't oil them or because we sit on them so much?
1771 2018-07-14 19:37:15 As big as that is , is nothing compared with massive Scottish Oil resources , the British gifted to Norway
1772 2018-07-14 19:37:08 $CEI all  will be on $CEI next week. This is going to be massive. Regardless of oil prices. The company news alone will push this to where it should be. Guessing between the $2-$3 range possibly in this coming week. #energy #stocks #stockstowatch
1773 2018-07-14 19:37:07 Coconut oil all over my body
1774 2018-07-14 19:37:05 i kinda love how jarring the sequencing on oil of every pearl's un-insides is, it just really doesn't give a single fuck about the constant emotional whiplash it inflicts on u track-to-track
1775 2018-07-14 19:36:58 The amount of oil my face secretes, I can easily sell it for $100 a barrel
1776 2018-07-14 19:36:44 Oil demand plummets mean the price of oil falls.
1777 2018-07-14 19:35:55 No, no subsidies for either oil or green energy. Let the market decide what is best.
1778 2018-07-14 19:35:50 I know and it doesn't make any sense. If we're the biggest exporter of oil then why do we let OPEC dictate the price per barrel?
1779 2018-07-14 19:35:47 And Trump is vying to provide Germany our oil and gas denying Russia  $70 billion. Your point?
1780 2018-07-14 19:35:27 Go and sit down my friend. If not for gullible Nigerians that can't do without Yam and oil no one should be voting for APC n PDP anymore.
1781 2018-07-14 19:35:19 I'll bring a bottle of rum and some soda..  And of course the baby oil...
1782 2018-07-14 19:35:01 Why are we exporting oil?  Is the USA buying oil?  This makes zero sense.
1783 2018-07-14 19:35:01 Partying inside oasis, palengke naman na. 
1784 2018-07-14 19:34:56 Oh no. I just started walking a lot and drinking the raspberry leaf tea and using evening primrose oil to help bring on dilation
1785 2018-07-14 19:34:53 I'd say its unconscionable to meet Terrorist Iran Nation, then give the terrorists Regime millions in cash on planes, billions in releases frozen assets along with oil production profits to build nuclear weapons. Including development of ICBMS.

1786 2018-07-14 19:34:40 Good lord! And omg yasss avocado toast with a poached egg!  I make an avocado salad with cucumber, red onion, olive oil, lime, and cilantro on top of grilled chicken! Then remix it in the AM w/ a poached egg 
1787 2018-07-14 19:34:35 I’m getting out of my car at the oil change place and one of the maintenance guys as he is walking by me says “Great another shitty ass Nissan!” Like bra I’m standing right infont of you  he was dead ass serious too looked me dead in the eye as he grabbed my keys 
1788 2018-07-14 19:34:35 I’ll let myself use veg oil next time around when I do the Walmart version !
But I already started this one sans oil and I wanna stay consistent, ya know?

1801 2018-07-14 19:33:07 Did some more work on my new painting for a few hours. I'm excited about its progress. I'm gonna let it dry for about a week or so then do some more work to it to enhance a few things. I love oil paint. 
1802 2018-07-14 19:33:01 wait that might be a problem? we have to make sure my 150 dollar muji diffuser and the bubble machine have the same essential oil scents or my chakra is really going to be thrown off.
1803 2018-07-14 19:33:00 And we pay Muslims for our oil....  Nothing wrong with that. It’s just kind of weird given your stance on Muslims.
1804 2018-07-14 19:32:50 It's the oil on the lips that i wantu use na
1805 2018-07-14 19:32:39 Did some more work on my new painting for a few hours. I'm excited about its progress. I'm gonna let it dry for about a week or so then do some more work to it to enhance a few things. I love oil paint.

1807 2018-07-14 19:32:17 Foil, little bit of oil, keep away from the hottest heat, peel down to the last layers on the cloves and the one holding them together
1808 2018-07-14 19:32:05 oil tanker turning around springs to mind ...
1809 2018-07-14 19:31:48 Snake oil? You are kidding right?
1810 2018-07-14 19:31:32 To be fair, a majority of Crimeans did favor joining Russia. Just not 97%. And the US did foment the coup in Kiev bcz they wanted Ukraine to join NATO and the EU. When Yanukovich decided to accept Putin's offer not to join EU is when this blew up. US goal: oil & gas in Blk sea.
1811 2018-07-14 19:31:22 Why are oil changes not $5?
1812 2018-07-14 19:31:19 my patients r great because all they do is tell me their eye horror stories and try to sell me cbd oil ahdjkdlf
1813 2018-07-14 19:31:15 So my little brother came to change his oil, this dude that would always flirt with me so happened to work where we came...
1814 2018-07-14 19:31:06 Salicylic acid is commonly used to treat acne, but it just does not seem to work for me. Anyone else? Tea Tree oil and Benzoyl Peroxide work much better for me.
1815 2018-07-14 19:30:58 Pay off the $700 I owe sprint, get car insurance since I’ve had to drive uninsured for a grip, help my grandma with bills, get a new car since mine has an oil leak in the engine, rest in savings for when I actually get a job so I can put t towards an apartment.
1816 2018-07-14 19:30:34 Gonna brush up on my Spy Hunter oil slick strategy
1817 2018-07-14 19:30:33 As a marine oil spill expert, I am reminded that a #TransMountain tanker DilBit oil spill would sink in waters like that, making recovery virtually impossible.
1818 2018-07-14 19:30:29 They might have got some right if they asked them where oil comes from or which countries United States has invaded.
1819 2018-07-14 19:30:25 There's this annoyingly happy teen couple at jiffylube and damn just let the rest of us be miserable while waiting for our oil change in peace.
1820 2018-07-14 19:30:24 Haha why you saying «russian oil money», your money come from your Arab sugar daddys so get the fuck out
1821 2018-07-14 19:30:09 By the way did you know that a lot of US citizens warmed their asses with Russian oil last winter?
1822 2018-07-14 19:29:53 No satisfaction such as twisting off an old oil filter
1823 2018-07-14 19:29:46 People in our generation: “oh you have a headache? Try rubbing some of this essential oil on your dick and it should go away.”
1824 2018-07-14 19:29:40 My dad came and got my car from work because I needed an oil change 
1825 2018-07-14 19:29:37 Can u use coconut oil as an alternative for ointment on a new tat or that's Odee?
1826 2018-07-14 19:29:35 Oil is a vital source of energy for the world and will likely remain so for many decades to come, even under the most optimistic assumptions about the growth in alternative energy sources. Most countries are significantly affected by developments in the oil market....

1829 2018-07-14 19:28:49 Build that pipeline, let’s get this beautiful Alberta oil flowing.
1830 2018-07-14 19:28:41 Keep selling that snake oil though.
1831 2018-07-14 19:28:32 Bout to roll up sick asf go get this oil change and throw on this body shaper cause I be damned lol
1832 2018-07-14 19:28:32 Spoken like someone who has no idea how much oil North America burns.
1833 2018-07-14 19:28:28 Ok but why more cowboys in Texas vs hippies in Cali for example? Geography/climate. Why less freedom in middle east vs north america? Geography. Oil/resource based economy creating concentration of wealth, consumer based economy promoting diversity and entrepreneurship.

1835 2018-07-14 19:28:00 It takes 5 hours for me to treat, wash, condition, dry and then oil my hair , and I do this shit every weekend.
1836 2018-07-14 19:27:55 I also agree that structural economic problems in the Russian economy are much bigger issue, but those who've been bearish on sanctions' effect on the energy sector have downplayed effects on longer-term investment cycles/Russia in MENA/OFAC scrutiny of some deals re oil.
1837 2018-07-14 19:27:30 Well I guess they usually had vegetable oil
1838 2018-07-14 19:27:26 Found 1 oil made in Canada
1839 2018-07-14 19:27:24 I hate cooking man, the oil be poppinn on me 
1840 2018-07-14 19:27:18 If we sell oil to China the emissions from that oil is not the Canadian producers responsibility, their responsibility ends when delivered.
1841 2018-07-14 19:27:16 This great and all, but how will we be less dependent on Saudi if we are EXPORTING all of our oil? We need to place a greater amount in our own market to increase the supply and lower the prices...I know this isn't what the oil companies want, but Americans need it.
1842 2018-07-14 19:26:47 WITH ALL THE OIL WE PRODUCE RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S,WHY ARE WE STILL BUYING BILLIONS FROM OPEC AND WHY ARE OUR GAS PRICES SO HIGH? WE SHOULD BE PAYING LESS THAN A DOLLAR FOR GAS LIKE WE DID IN THE 50'S & 60"S BEFORE BIG OIL OPEC. WE'RE ALWAYS SCREWING OUR SELVES.
1843 2018-07-14 19:26:42 I'm good.
1844 2018-07-14 19:26:37 They need to hurry up and change my oil so I can get back in my own car
1845 2018-07-14 19:26:11 Scarves? Ascot? Vitamin e oil?
1846 2018-07-14 19:26:04 What Aldawa ruling party inherited from Saddam Hussein is the "bubble culture". He used to call any movement in the street as "bubble" that must be finished immediately. it happens that Southern Iraq is the richest in oil & the poorest in services.
1847 2018-07-14 19:25:58 i would never give any money to her based just on how she pronounces oil

1857 2018-07-14 19:25:07 Yo someone just paid the oil change guys... $80 to park in their parking spots up in here... damn the real ness of Pride weekend.
1858 2018-07-14 19:25:07 Does this mean we are producing so much oil that we have excess?  If we're exporting all this oil, are we dependent on any oil from other countries?

1861 2018-07-14 19:24:42 It's not though. We need oil.
1862 2018-07-14 19:24:28 Sulfur content is a big component in oil pricing mechanisms as high-sulfur crudes are generally cheaper owing to their corrosive properties which also cause problems in refineries.

1863 2018-07-14 19:24:23 So I really need to get my oil changed but I’ve never gotten it changed in Napa, only Chico. SOS where do I go?
1864 2018-07-14 19:24:11 Left on a coconut & olive oil mask for 24 hrs, washed it & now my hair is SO soft, straight & shiny 
1865 2018-07-14 19:24:10 @beavertontoyota Why is it taking over 3 hours to change my oil and replace the coolant fluid in my Prius?  I was quoted 1.5 hours at 9am.

1871 2018-07-14 19:23:21 - I did it on wet hair 
- I did big sections
- I used leave in conditioner 
- then I used mousse
- and then I used eco styling gel
- then I twist, wrap, twist and wrap until I get to the ends and put a little of extra virgin olive oil on it 
- sometimes I use hair ties to hold
1872 2018-07-14 19:23:19 i.e why you got power in centre
FYI
In 2014 petrol rate was 84 at the same time crude oil price is 120 dollar per barrel
After Modi became PM co-incidently crude oil price come down to 40 dollar per barrel but he reduced the price from 84 to 75 only
First you should know clearly
1873 2018-07-14 19:23:19 I got my oil changed and my tires rotated and balanced. My trucks happy 
1874 2018-07-14 19:23:11 I use it with no oil most of the time so skilleting works.

US on pace to be number one exporter of crude oil, more than Saudi Arabia and Russia

Awesome news, the less dependent we are on Saudi (who financed and planned 9/11) and Russia (who tried to disrupt our elections) the better! 

#MAGA TRUMP gets things done, period!
1880 2018-07-14 19:22:01 Don't I know it.  I witnessed the destruction first hand during a trip to Borneo in 2010...since then I have avoided all palm oil products.
1881 2018-07-14 19:21:53 Even in "supportive" studies effect size is so small it's not worth forcing people to eat bland food for (unless already hypertensive). Especially since then they'll add butter, oil, sugar, and whatnot to recover that taste.
1882 2018-07-14 19:21:39 Shades of the 60's and 70's. National Debt up, Personal Debt through the roof, but then came the magic cheque book and all Oil had to be traded in $US, and the US never looked back
Or had to cash any of the cheques

1890 2018-07-14 19:19:35 Reporters will sometimes take Trump’s argument as if it’s a serious argument. As if there is a serious reason why we don’t need NATO and as if it’s not just a whim of a fickle, negligent, irresponsible snake oil salesman.
1891 2018-07-14 19:19:27 Brian Banda on #TimesExclusive asks Mia: "Do you have oil wells in Saudi Arabia were you getting money to finance MCP?"

1892 2018-07-14 19:19:25 Oil will be around for hundreds if not thousands of years to come, but no one will be paying more than a couple of dollars for a barrel of the stuff. The oil market will become extinct, not the oil itself.

1903 2018-07-14 19:18:14 @amjoyshow @realDonaldTrump is all about $$$. He wants them to buy more U.S. arms. Same with the oil pipeline -- he wants them to buy U.S. natural gas. He cares nothing about long-term alliances; everything is for sale, including our government, which he is selling dept. by dept.
1904 2018-07-14 19:18:08 Get a nonstick pan, heat on medium with butter and/or olive oil, add the matzo. Leave it for a minute or two, then slowly chop and mix until it's as done as you want. I top it with cinnamon, red pepper flakes, and a good drizzle of honey. All the hot ingredients are optional. 2/
1905 2018-07-14 19:18:07 So I went with @taylormit96 to get her oil changed and they pulled her aside and she comes back and says “well I have a dead squirrel in my filter”. WHAT. THE. HECK.

1928 2018-07-14 19:13:49 Those cant be unsupervised, boo, esp if they well ripe; and maybe the oil was way too hot at the outset.
1929 2018-07-14 19:13:37 Indeed.

1949 2018-07-14 19:10:57 You just don’t understand, Rachel is so powerful she can push the worldwide price of oil down, but ever with her immense power, she’s just not powerful enough to push it back up. It’s like god making a rock even he can’t lift.
1950 2018-07-14 19:10:40 You put the rice aside so you can make the omelette portion on the same pan. Since most of the oil I used got absorbed in the fried rice, you add some oil of your choice or butter (I like sesame oil with my eggs, personally) and heat it up. While that’s warming up—-
1951 2018-07-14 19:10:36 are you trying to oil them from the inside?
1952 2018-07-14 19:10:35 Black Enterprise is in the room - brand influencers with 100k+ followers - entrepreneurs in STEM, TECH, FASHION, OIL/GAS, and more are here and I'ma try to find a new business partner since y'all ain't in the way.  #yeahIsaidit #HERidea
1953 2018-07-14 19:10:32 If I didn’t like Norway so much, I might think they were taking the piss.

The UKGov gifts them Scottish seas with hidden oil, 
and Norway gives the UK the one thing they have the Scotland doesn’t need:

1957 2018-07-14 19:10:07 Note to sandwich makers everywhere: sandwiches with oil and vinegar—say, the classic Italian—should never have mayo and/or mustard. (Actually, no sandwich should have mayo, but that’s a whole other story.)
1958 2018-07-14 19:10:06 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
1959 2018-07-14 19:10:00 One way is relying on U.S for defense and guarantee of safe passage on the seas. 
Germany for instance has a massive U.S troop presence which boosts econ around bases.
1960 2018-07-14 19:09:42 ... and of course ... LA = highly dependent on oil/gas industry...

1961 2018-07-14 19:09:37 We need to have a serious conversation on why dhal puri is trash:

1) its messy 
2) it makes the curry clumpy
3) oil roti exists
1962 2018-07-14 19:09:35 Add oil to a fire.
1963 2018-07-14 19:09:17 One pillar of the Duopoly overwhelming the other is how best  it can be defeated. The greed and opportunism of the Dem Leadership and consultants can accomplish this easily in the current political environment and with the oil industry facing decline.
1964 2018-07-14 19:09:08 Gue dua duanya, oil dulu.

1967 2018-07-14 19:08:27 Put garlic salt on the oil. If you’re not into that, you can crush three cloves of garlic and toss that into the hot pan with a pinch of salt.  Then add the rice and the two seasonings and mix it all around to toast the rice.  Once you get it all mixed together and lightly golden
1968 2018-07-14 19:08:26 The US doesn't need the oil if they didn't export 10 million barrels to India between April and June. It would have been more cost efficient to ship from Al-Basrah Oil Terminal to India.
1969 2018-07-14 19:08:25 The French oil company #Total is now controlling 10% of the world liquefied natural #gas market
1970 2018-07-14 19:08:21 Just went to get a oil change and tire rotation this morning... this is too much adulting for me.
1971 2018-07-14 19:08:18 What the fuck do our oil EXPORTS have to do with our dependence? If we're exporting then we don't need it. We still import their oil cuz it's cheaper!!
1972 2018-07-14 19:08:08 And because the NDP govt didn't let the economy crash when oil prices dropped like the Cons always do
1973 2018-07-14 19:07:57 ".#French oil major #Total  is set to emerge as the all-important player in the fledgling oil industry in Kenya and the region.This follows its word to the government a fortnight ago that it would support the development of the crude oil pipeline from Turkana- Lamu." @SwaberaSaid

1978 2018-07-14 19:07:38 Oil Minister Luaibi said govt would provide 10,000 jobs $2 bil for development of water system and improved services in Basra Big problem there is only a caretaker govt right now so these are empty promises Statements will mean nothing when new govt created
1979 2018-07-14 19:07:38 Well whilst @realDonaldTrump organised a 1-2-1 meeting with Putin after the FBI have indicted Russians over collusion charges, he also simultaneously suggests Germany is "under control of Russia" because of an energy trade deal. Is he sour Germany don't want American oil? #Trump

1985 2018-07-14 19:06:20 He can come to Newfoundland and wear a southwest’er.. he’s brought safety back to our coast. Those oil and gas guys you talk about, he’s made decisions that have saved lives in that industry, on our side of the country.. calm down Theo, he’s not all bad!
1986 2018-07-14 19:05:57 They're for tiny potato slivers after you hold your head upside down and fill your sinuses with boiling oil.
1987 2018-07-14 19:05:56 Between 96th & 104th on Peoria. Several houses had contaminated wells, & were bought by Shell Oil (partially responsible for clean up) one had a barn that was supposed to be haunted. It's long gone now.
1988 2018-07-14 19:05:53 And we are suprised?  Lol. But at least we can still buy their oil.

1990 2018-07-14 19:05:47 Turkana people ni comedians...ati wanataka pesa ya oil waekewe ATM directly isiende kwa county government?... how realistic is that?
1991 2018-07-14 19:05:46 Yeah but liberals hate oil. They will be against it.
1992 2018-07-14 19:05:41 (4) Exxon will still produce oil with rigs, explosives, earthly pressure and facilities.
1993 2018-07-14 19:05:22 Abi oo
1994 2018-07-14 19:05:11 A pipeline you ‘support’ and voted yes to #BillC48 which does not support Alberta oil.
1995 2018-07-14 19:05:06 That means all the technology used in the east must be returned to the west. Give back the oil rigs from the Middle East. And only the Irish can dress in Halloween costumes, or make jack-o-lanterns, but you can keep all the green beer. The Irish don’t drink it. 
1996 2018-07-14 19:05:04 My oil was irresponsibly low in my car smh. I forgot all about it.
1997 2018-07-14 19:04:58 Shannon Watts?
what does the public relations executive from Monsanto and big oil have to do with this?
1998 2018-07-14 19:04:37 my goodness, check the country's econ history. people rarely benefit from high govt borrowings. only infra oligarchs would benefit, why we pay for it through higher VAT & oil taxes
1999 2018-07-14 19:04:35 I think my brother may have had oil panic. I have Marion’s Cement Factory!
2000 2018-07-14 19:04:16 In Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that an American oil company could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute for accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia.
2001 2018-07-14 19:04:06 As they say, there is no such thing as free lunch! But in principle, it is better to focus bilateral deals on a monorail than an oil refinery. We'll b3 watching!

2004 2018-07-14 19:03:20 Okay - how do you most like to eat basil? Do you like it in any cooked dishes? Because you can pulverize just with oil (into a paste) and freeze in cubes to add to soup or marinara sauce later in the year. You can also dry it.

2021 2018-07-14 19:01:16 For sure! So for the Yakisoba sauce you can use any store-bought or simple recipe. But how I make it is I fry the kimchi in some oil and I keep the kimchi juice aside. Add the pork belly and fry for a couple min. Then toss in the noodles, sauce, kimchi juice and top with onions!
2022 2018-07-14 19:01:15 Again...for @PutinRF_Eng @KremlinRussia_E ....it’s about four words “Oil And Gas Exploration.” It’s the Crimea, it’s the Divide and Conquer with the West etc...but it’s bureaucrats play w/no exit strategy.
2023 2018-07-14 19:01:05 You don't get it: Over 50% of Russian revenue is oil & gas related and it represents 16% of their GDP. They can't issue bonds in rubles so they need euros & dollars. They stop selling that gas, their economy collapses. Again, who's dependent on who?

2034 2018-07-14 19:00:23 Was not expecting to have to get a oil change today
2035 2018-07-14 19:00:20 Well ... hiring a former oil lobbyist as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency was ... well, not possible to be an accident. As the saying goes, coincidences require lots of planning. We'll touch back on that ... person. (and others)
2036 2018-07-14 19:00:18 Russia Hoax is stupidity - Obama turned 2 illegal Bush wars into 7 killing 800 000 people and displacing 7 million -Bush was Obama as wars same debt 11.6 trillion making the elite oil rich as 33 million Americans live in poverty.
2037 2018-07-14 19:00:16 Had the day off yesterday so I went to the doctor, got blood work done, bought a new iPhone, had my car inspected & an oil change! Very productive 
2038 2018-07-14 19:00:05 2 week wait for an Oil Change!? Dealers wonder why people don't use their service.

2040 2018-07-14 18:59:38 Jealousy probably m8 and the fact we've spent oil money getting to the top of the league. I guess we will never be liked by other fans like we were in the 80s and 90s when we were shit and people felt sorry 4 us 
2041 2018-07-14 18:59:38 The Hydro Boost gel cream and their hydrating serum. Also the light cleansing oil.

2045 2018-07-14 18:59:12 The difference, Kak Kamal, is that in KRG protests were peaceful, government violent. In the south, regardless of their rightful demands, the protestors sadly are vandalizing oil facilities, public places such as roads and airports. What state would stand for such actions?
2046 2018-07-14 18:58:56 Steam it. Add a bit of salt, drizzle with hot sesame oil or olive oil, in which you have sautéed some of garlic. 

Back away from the cheese. 

This mom is proud.
2047 2018-07-14 18:58:45 Agree but we should keep our oil and give the American people cheaper gas
2048 2018-07-14 18:58:26 I’ve been at the damn dealership for over 2 hours for a stupid oil change. Good god.

2053 2018-07-14 18:57:33 UK controlled Iranian oil in the 50s, not US - UK economic benefit was threatened by Mossadeg’s nationalism.
2054 2018-07-14 18:57:18 I bought kmi back when they cut the dividend and oil was at $30. I think I'll hold til 2019
2055 2018-07-14 18:56:54 Ok, I get olive oil. But I'm afraid I don't understand baby oil.
2056 2018-07-14 18:56:49 I remember Jimmy Carter telling us our oil reserves were all but gone. I also remember my parents sitting in gas lines.
2057 2018-07-14 18:56:45 wait does the store sell... Nothing but olive oil
2058 2018-07-14 18:56:37 Lol

2079 2018-07-14 18:53:56 Techinically both tar sands and oil sands are not accurate. It really is bituminous sands. Tar sands was used until I believe 50s or 60s, then both tar and oil sands were used.
2080 2018-07-14 18:53:47 When they run out of oil and money.....money buys silence and consent, SA is proof of this. Sad

2082 2018-07-14 18:53:37 If we have so much oil then why are we not using it here so we don’t have to import from the outside and we could stop the Market Fraud !
2083 2018-07-14 18:53:33 With all that oil, u bouta get the US military barging into the store looking to snatch it right off ur face.

2086 2018-07-14 18:52:37 I've never understood that? If we have so much oil, why are we buying off other countries?
2087 2018-07-14 18:52:34 If you are a Nigerian politician in control of government resources, you'd believe this is the best time to rig elections. Oil prices are high, the international community is uninterested in "human rights" & the people are VERY poor.

2098 2018-07-14 18:50:58 @AskTSA Can I carry protein powder, vitamin and fish oil tablets in my checked luggage on my international flight to the United States?
2099 2018-07-14 18:50:56 It looks stunning!

The coconut oil used for cooking? 
And what do u use to wash your hair?
2100 2018-07-14 18:50:56 I have to special order the oil filters for my car and then take them to the jiffy lube to get my oil changed. Ugh
2101 2018-07-14 18:50:52 We should've taken over Iraq's oil when we spend 2 trillion on a war.
2102 2018-07-14 18:50:47 Anything with rose hip seed oil. Broke out so bad I had to go to urgent care for a shot 
2103 2018-07-14 18:50:40 Fatimtim @fadiiimatu
2104 2018-07-14 18:50:35 About to do my makeup just to go get an oil change
2105 2018-07-14 18:50:34 I can’t . They just be reading me for filth

2107 2018-07-14 18:50:25 I need my oil changed and my state inspection . . I’ll call after this blessing of a shower .
2108 2018-07-14 18:50:22 Yvan; produced and used responsibly, oil and coal are not necessarily toxic. What you seem to say is the equivalent of me saying a blow on the head from a wind mill or cutting my throat with a shard of solar panel will kill me
2109 2018-07-14 18:50:14 You guys have to stop blaming the boomers for everything. They might not have changed the oil regularly but Gen X is gleefully driving the car straight off the cliff.
2110 2018-07-14 18:50:07 ねましみー
2111 2018-07-14 18:50:05 One man's opinion:
Popeye's should fry chicken in Olive Oil.

2114 2018-07-14 18:49:54  buy me the oil before u go
2115 2018-07-14 18:49:43 We’re doing vinyl from our own shop but it will be a bit later on. There’s been an oil supply issue !!??
2116 2018-07-14 18:49:41 Walaupun emang sama2 oil dan logikanya kulit bisa bersih. Tapi nyatanya, ada oil yang formulanya bisa menyumbat pori atau bahkan tidak semaksimal itu untuk membersihkan wajah. Kamu bisa google untuk lbh lengkapnya yaaa..
2117 2018-07-14 18:49:39 I tried a witch hazel toner and I recently went back to Thaters rose toner and I can tell the diff smh. What’s a good oil cleansing oil  for oily / acne prone skin and is Castile soap ok?
2118 2018-07-14 18:49:36 Tomorrow at the seaside for the oil  #upnorth #eastcoast
2119 2018-07-14 18:49:35 My daughter had a recurring lice issue in MS. We tried all the treatments. The one that finally worked was mayonnaise mixed with tea tree and lavender oil. Then sprayed her hair every day with a mix of tea tree oil and water. Never came back.
2120 2018-07-14 18:49:08 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
2121 2018-07-14 18:48:47 This guy is a snake oil salesman & scam artist. Don't be taken in.
2122 2018-07-14 18:48:47 Me, trying to break into the world of voice acting
Director: we’re sorry, we’re not looking for a deflated balloon nor off key oil rig
Me: okay :(
2123 2018-07-14 18:48:45 Great snack: take some pre sliced mozzarella . Put a little olive oil on it , salt, pepper and basil . Tasty and healthy
2124 2018-07-14 18:48:34 You should try dukbokki with ramen noodles, seafood dumplings, scallions, carrots sauteed in five spice and sesame oil. It's all placed in a slightly spicy pho broth.  The leftover broth is spooned over pork fried rice (you can use shrimp or tofu as a substitute). It's delish!
2125 2018-07-14 18:48:32 Enggak nder. Gak semua face oil bisa jadi cleansing oil. Kenapa ada produk yang dinamakan clensing oil? Karena sdh dirancang dan dibuat sedemikian rupa biar gak tertinggal di kulit saat dibilas. Juga tidak mengikat kotoran
2126 2018-07-14 18:48:26 anyone know where the cheapest place to get your oil changed is?
2127 2018-07-14 18:48:01 Oil.....sheesh why bring THAT up? Shivers down my spine now...…. My son trades in precious metals, have to talk to him about this.
2128 2018-07-14 18:47:55 I never thought I would see the day when AMERICA produced more crude oil then the middle East. All thanks to President Trump! The best PRESIDENT E-V-E-R! #Trump2020 #KAG
2129 2018-07-14 18:47:33 One more comment: API gravity is largely determined by Hydrogen/Carbon ratio in the oil. A lighter crude (higher API) is obtained either by addition of Hydrogen or removal of Carbon. Delayed Coking does the latter.
Cheers
2130 2018-07-14 18:47:25 So come on, pals! Let’s pour more oil in the fire! 

I wanna see it burning!
2131 2018-07-14 18:47:24 Green parties are usually the poorest, they can’t attract donor to their cause that’s why they don get much support. So who is pushing the refugee are welcome narrative?  the oil money from ME.
2132 2018-07-14 18:47:18 We should ban those really big straws that carry the oil through the great lakes and indigenous lands.
2133 2018-07-14 18:47:03 When it does rain, remember all the oil that has built up on the roadways. It will be slick as owl poop. Hope it does rain soon.
2134 2018-07-14 18:47:01 peppermint oil is my holy grail
2135 2018-07-14 18:46:57 Theory: Take 5 Oil guy could have given Kenny a cup with 2 adderral in it and Kenny was just doing the responsible thing.
2136 2018-07-14 18:46:53 small (?) salad with MCT oil for dressing.  
2137 2018-07-14 18:46:48 Are the results permanent? And should I rub the oil on my skin for muscle soreness or ingest that as well?
2138 2018-07-14 18:46:46 Calling all oil painters I have a really pretentious request and willing to slap some green in order to do it! 

(I want a painting made)
2139 2018-07-14 18:46:45 [Thinks about what Dad always said about not needing to crank down an oil filter too tight every time]

*Walk of shame to the toolbox*

**Gets out the monster pliers**
2140 2018-07-14 18:46:37 A oil armor mod that gives the assassin’s a chance to miss grabbing a hero. As for tower I can’t think of one and for weapon a banishment chip that makes it so there’s a chance enemies killed can’t be resurrected as skeletons or a ice weapon mod that can freeze enemies.
2141 2018-07-14 18:46:34 The craziest thing in a high-inflation economy, commodities become valuable because they increase in value with inflation better than most things. This means that the gold advertisers on Fox News make more money. 

And then there's oil...
2142 2018-07-14 18:46:28 Was only expecting to pay $30-$40 for my oil change. But of course they talked my ass to getthing shit done on my car since I have 15K so now I’m paying $129 
2143 2018-07-14 18:46:24 Jesus a good role model let's see , 1 - abusing his mother2- shouting screaming turning tables over in a temple 3 - cursing a fig tree 4- calling all gentiles dogs & Swine 5,- allowing a women to rub oil his body 6- been dragged away for being mad by his family
2144 2018-07-14 18:46:11 There are those oil free peel masks tho xD
2145 2018-07-14 18:45:56 They were shorter, but it’s only because I didn’t have them professionally removed. But my lashes are longer now then they were before because I put castor oil and Vaseline on them every night.
2146 2018-07-14 18:45:55 Let's not judge her till we see the convo,then we'll ascertain the real how from the hubby or d geh
2147 2018-07-14 18:45:50 If you regard the Duopoly as Controlled Opposition, it's useful to both parties and certain Capitalist interests. Notably fossil fuel industry has supported the GOP since early days of Std Oil. If that industry is in decline the dynamics and utility of the system change
2148 2018-07-14 18:45:37 I check my mental state like I check the oil in my car: extremely infrequently and only if something is making a thumping sound
2149 2018-07-14 18:45:37 Does he need some EXO oil blotting sheets from nature republic?

2153 2018-07-14 18:45:01 Coal and oil are pretty toxic too.
2154 2018-07-14 18:44:58 gua ttp berpegang sama cleansing oil sih krn bener2 ngebersihin muka sampe bersih bgt, abis itu lgsg cuci muka pake cleansing foam
2155 2018-07-14 18:44:58 There’s something beautiful about the smell of freshly burnt two stroke oil and petrol
2156 2018-07-14 18:44:57 oil dulu sih aku
2157 2018-07-14 18:44:48 Velocity is snake oil, statistically invalid for the way most people us it. Planning poker is to catalyze common understanding of work.
2158 2018-07-14 18:44:44 All of these politicians voted yes to #BillC48 which does not support Alberta oil
2159 2018-07-14 18:44:27 Creme of nature & olive oil .
2160 2018-07-14 18:44:19 Have you seen the land after they've taken all nutrients out of the soil by extracting oil? Last I heard the middle east wasn't known for growing food. We sell that oil on the open open mrkt, it's not 4 US! We sell our oil in exchange for ag/food. #canteatoil #cantdrinkoil
2161 2018-07-14 18:44:15 Thanks to @SearsAuto my $40 oil change visit turned into a $540 visit. Thanks for closing the the AR locations 
2162 2018-07-14 18:44:11 Some girls now put tomatoes sauce and palm oil on their pad, if u knw wat I mean...

2164 2018-07-14 18:43:54 So let’s sanction the Russian oil company.
2165 2018-07-14 18:43:48 In other words, you just found out about it. They have been buying Russian oil for nearly 20 years. #idiotdetected
2166 2018-07-14 18:43:43 Kalo gue cleansing oil dulu baru micelar water
2167 2018-07-14 18:43:36 They can have him.
2168 2018-07-14 18:43:24 Two stroke engine possibly the dirtiest engine around. Nope. I’m sure those Greenpeace boats circling oil rigs run on unicorns and rainbows though.
2169 2018-07-14 18:43:17 Ohioans have a moral duty to future generations to clean up our oil & gas pollution by transitioning to renewables. #RobPortman is bribed by polluters, enriching himself with government debt Ohioans’ kids & grandkids will inherit.
2170 2018-07-14 18:42:52 Any thoughts on stuff old school remedies like tea tree oil?
2171 2018-07-14 18:42:48 The golden oil of the King will get so strong on your flesh that all your problems will be vaporized.
2172 2018-07-14 18:42:46 Especially if he’s going in for oil every 3 months. Cmon Kenny! Learn about full synthetics
2173 2018-07-14 18:42:40 Why are people excited that the US is becoming a big energy exporter?  Getting off of ME oil was/is great but why are we exporting a single drop while still buying OPEC oil?

We’re paying for it, big time, at the pump.

Think people.
2174 2018-07-14 18:42:32 @taylorswift13 @taylornation13 Hey, Taylor and TN! Best of luck in night 2 of the Philly shows! Rock it, Taylor! Get it, girl! :-) Looking forward to my Indy show in mid-September!

2176 2018-07-14 18:42:26 All of these politicians also voted yes to #BillC48 which does not support Alberta oil
2177 2018-07-14 18:42:24 You are being stupid on purpose, the US has burned 36 billion barrels of oil from its offshore development and you’re claiming it’s no big deal? What next? Pebble mine won’t hurt Salmon?
2178 2018-07-14 18:42:18 When you go get an oil change are they supposed to change your filter too?
2179 2018-07-14 18:42:17 saskia: what do you guys use to take your makeup off?
Me and Alfie: makeup wipes and micellar water 
Saskia: oh I use cooking oil and hand sanitizer
2180 2018-07-14 18:42:17 Most upgraders in Vzla. are NOT operating.
Actual sales are NOT of LSSC (low sulphur synthetic crude) but simply DCO (diluted crude oil: extra-heavy + diluent w/o removing carbon or sulphur), an inferior product (but cheaper to produce) compared to upgraded oil.
2181 2018-07-14 18:42:13 Well, wash it well, try with Turkish yoghurt, red pepper, salt, olive oil and garlic. Bon apetit!
2182 2018-07-14 18:41:56 I'm just over here wondering why I never thought to try using coconut oil for either of those things 
2183 2018-07-14 18:41:35 I was gonna go treat myself to a pedicure today and then my oil change was $10 more than I remembered it being  happy saturday!!!
2184 2018-07-14 18:41:26 US on pace to be number one exporter of crude oil, more than Saudi Arabia and Russia

Awesome news, the less dependent we are on Saudi (who financed and planned 9/11) and Russia (who tried to disrupt our elections) the better!

2187 2018-07-14 18:41:12 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2188 2018-07-14 18:41:11 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2190 2018-07-14 18:40:55 Tea tree oil is the best tho
2191 2018-07-14 18:40:51 No coincidence Trump made issue of German /Russian pipeline deal. Clearly Trump set out to SELL BOTH MILITARY ARMS AND OIL/GAS TO EU ..MADE IN USA...in his America First mission/vision! Trudeau OTOH, due to impending election, acquiesced n relented per Mtl objection to pipe east.
2192 2018-07-14 18:40:48 Not a word from dems either on German gas deal that will be worth tens of billions over time, while they whine about lack of Russian sanctions.
2193 2018-07-14 18:40:47 Will you say the same about the oil and gas industry who have received much higher subsidies for decades?
2194 2018-07-14 18:40:44 Still appalled that Take 5 Oil gave him an empty cup to drink from
2195 2018-07-14 18:40:41 How thoughtless of her not to give Scotland’s oil to everyone  and to claim it for UK

2217 2018-07-14 18:38:18 Corrupt GOP? It was corrupt Obama and his onerous regulations on production and shipment that was strangling our crude oil production. Oil companies were shutting done many, many wells due to him. First learn about what you're spouting off about. Ignorant.
2218 2018-07-14 18:38:15 The amount of oil on my hair and skin...ciao I need a shower

2222 2018-07-14 18:37:38 Burning yourself with hot oil, nope, wouldn’t recommend that. Especially when it’s been so warm outside that your cold tap is luke regardless of how long you run it for.

2225 2018-07-14 18:37:21 In 2019, the US is expected to average 12 million barrels of crude oil production per day – making the world’s top oil producer....ahead of Saudi Arabia & Russia....China was projected to overtake the USA as the world's biggest economy by 2050..watch that change
2226 2018-07-14 18:37:20 It threatens the welfare state - Pelosi's base
2227 2018-07-14 18:37:06 What? Why would he shoot solar and government subsidies in the foot? It's his business model and everything the backwards coal/oil loving Repulitards stand for rails against it... What a dipshit.
2228 2018-07-14 18:36:55 Hillary Clinton, a Russian and a suitcase full of cash in a hotel room would be perfectly innocent though.
2229 2018-07-14 18:36:42 Fighting over oil fields & Gaza just before the world goes to hell with Climate Change. Do they think they are not in one of the worst areas to be affected by warming?? Its like fighting over a knife to see who can slit everyone's throat, with the Middle East up in flames.Irony+
2230 2018-07-14 18:36:28 Is this a religion now with you folks?  We've bombed Russian installations in Syria & killed several hundred Russian mercenaries there. We JUST handed down an indictment for 12 RU agents. 
We just told NATO to arm up against Putin & stop buying their oil.
Are you this dense?

2233 2018-07-14 18:36:05 Clearly BP was holding Obama hostage but why? The "unstoppable" oil leak was a power play. Did BP get the ransom they were asking for. BP knows the answer to that Question.
2234 2018-07-14 18:35:59 Ah shucks! You mean they are not buying their oil from us?
2235 2018-07-14 18:35:58 Yes the two stroke oil. I used to put some castrol R in my tank to make it smell nice. My mother’s neighbours made me push it down the road before starting it up with ultra loud expansion chambers. After I bought a H2 and a Z1 we had to move house.

2241 2018-07-14 18:35:21 Charlie we need to talk it has to do with this specific tweet. I would like Our Great President to Put The First Shovel In The Ground on a New Oil Refinery to be constructed Approved  here in USA, but before November Elections so The President Would Have National News Coverage
2242 2018-07-14 18:35:17 Boys who can't fix cars are so dramatic, you find them wearing work suits just to check oil in the vehicle.
2243 2018-07-14 18:35:11 so far as he no score dier he still be useless.....beans without oil
2244 2018-07-14 18:35:04 Maybe she can collide with Russia from her house too. You know Russia wants a piece of Alaskan oil!

2246 2018-07-14 18:34:56 Sure... "These Russian GRU individuals (some of which, I'm sure, are very nice people) did their important work while feckless Obama sat by and did nothing because he fantasizes about a Killary dystopia. And the fake MSM is in on it!"
RED PILL= SNAKE OIL

2247 2018-07-14 18:34:55 حبيبي والله كنت حاس مالك غيري وحترجع لي غصباً عن انفك.
2248 2018-07-14 18:34:47 People pray for cake. God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, and an oven, they get frustrated & leave the kitchen. Sometimes you have everything in front of you but how bad do you want it. Let that sink in realest shit I’ve heard.
2249 2018-07-14 18:34:44 I told them gas would go back up to the  5.00 a gal it keeps getting closer every day and the Oil comaneies keep getting richer and we get poorer it's not right.
2250 2018-07-14 18:34:39 You stand in a room with curved walls, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a stone column.
2251 2018-07-14 18:34:28 thread nderr!! jd bingung td ada yg bilang cleansing oil mending hadalabo tp ini biore mantul bgt
2252 2018-07-14 18:34:17 Y’all better get some wild growth oil for them edges
2253 2018-07-14 18:34:15 We’re big fans of CBD oil with Esther, she gets it daily with her breakfast.
2254 2018-07-14 18:34:13 @EnergyMinK @MboyaApollo @StateHouseKenya what is so difficult developing our own petroleum refinery for the Turkana oil to serve the local market and the surplus processed oil products for export? Instead of exporting cheap crude and importing refined products expensively
2255 2018-07-14 18:34:06 And speed restriction boards still lit by oil lamps ..... ahh the memories!  Thanks for sharing this.
2256 2018-07-14 18:34:00 334
2257 2018-07-14 18:33:57 Not acceptable? By who, you? You are importing Russian oil, Russian Steel, and pregnant Russian women to stay at your Florida properties so their babies can have American Citizenship. Not acceptable huh? Pot, meet Kettle. #Hypocrisy
2258 2018-07-14 18:33:42 If the U.S. is on track to become the #1 exporter of crude oil, why am I still paying $3.00 a gallon?
2259 2018-07-14 18:33:24 電波時計直ったので今日は大丈夫
2260 2018-07-14 18:33:17 Chuma ikikaa bila kupakwa oil itapata kutu.. If you know, you know
2261 2018-07-14 18:33:14 هي وقفت بس هو اطول منها وزعلت اعرف القصه ذي كنت اسمعها في الراديو.
2262 2018-07-14 18:33:05 They really wanna charge me $70 for oil change
2263 2018-07-14 18:33:05 After reading about Rockefeller and standard oil, I came to this conclusion long ago.
2264 2018-07-14 18:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
2265 2018-07-14 18:32:51 寝るタイミング失いました
2266 2018-07-14 18:32:45 That ermine-gland oil in the tasty cream fillin' of position, and...
2267 2018-07-14 18:32:30 Try baking your chopped up Brussels with chopped up bacon, a little oil and black pepper. I was like you until I tried them  Google it, it’s a simple recipe.
2268 2018-07-14 18:32:26 Both can be true. Clearly lots of frustration from the public about the ruling class. However there clearly is a wide ranging extreme right wing conspiracy to take advantage of these feelings. These neonazis seems to funded by big Russian and American big oil.
2269 2018-07-14 18:32:10 Our President is way ahead of the game. He's going after Germany to buy American oil.  Art of the deal.
2270 2018-07-14 18:31:53 “You don’t look Palestinian”

Oh sorry, I forgot my olive oil at home
2271 2018-07-14 18:31:49 *walks in with the baby oil for a massage*
2272 2018-07-14 18:31:48 86 million barrels of oil is consumed daily, globally; why do we wait until it's too late to change our habits. Let's build a global consortium to change this. @elonmusk can't do this alone,  even tho he is trying; let's all do it together. #ittakesacommunity #solarpower #tesla
2273 2018-07-14 18:31:35 I’m sure when it comes around to the #FauxNews sheep that the tax bill was a snake oil deal, they will want to end Muellers investigation. Saying it was unneeded spending to help save the budget. Blaming the budget mess on this is waiting to happen.
2274 2018-07-14 18:31:32 But he doesn't use emollients for his skin care - He prefers to slather motor oil on his pasty disgusting face ... 

Oh wait ...
2275 2018-07-14 18:31:31 baru tau hada labo punya cleansing oil, beli dimana nder?
2276 2018-07-14 18:31:26 Haha yep know that feeling mate, I had intention of topping fork oil but now using my insomnia to do it early in morning 
2277 2018-07-14 18:31:25 For soft hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2278 2018-07-14 18:31:22 Hey Sandawana oil/animal skin prices SA,Zambia,Namibia thanks for the follow!
2279 2018-07-14 18:31:18 Coke?" YES, petroleum coke (e.g., carbon). Hence the name of the process for 'upgrading' (increasing API) crude oil: Delayed Coking.
Abundant literature in the web, look it up.
2280 2018-07-14 18:31:14 Now we just need to produce more renewables, so we can harness the power of nature and have clean energy.  Glad we aren’t dependent on the Middle East anymore for oil, though.
2281 2018-07-14 18:31:13 That’s a state issue not federal. Currently I live in a state where fast food employees make more than national average because there is competition with natural gas/oil. States like NY/CA where cost of living is so high and taxes are so high of course unskilled labor gets hurt
2282 2018-07-14 18:30:56 CBD oil has really helped my senior cats w/their arthritis! & it's cured my Psoriasis & eczema! Amazing stuff!
2283 2018-07-14 18:30:49 The guy changing my oil just randomly goes "I have this thing for penguins lately. Dunno why, maybe its because they waddle around without a care in the world and if they get pissed off they can just go at you. Also they can slide on their bellies" 
2284 2018-07-14 18:30:42 Russia ia all about the Oil. They only ever wanted their man Trump. Huge repercussions in climate damages we may never overcome, and suprise...the Russians have always wanted to Geoengineer warming since the sixties. Slam dunk!
2285 2018-07-14 18:30:42 Majority of people realize that we need a pipeline out of the states, should of been done years ago, there will never be peace about oil projects, Canada has bigger fish to fry than one pipeline. Funny how no one gives a crap about the 60 year old one,
2286 2018-07-14 18:30:19 Basil isn’t over him. He has an oil painting of him in his house
2287 2018-07-14 18:30:13 Because he should deal with putin about this information. He's pissed at Germany because they're playing with trumpsky's new bff and he doesn't like it. It's funny how it's ok with us getting our oil from opec and that's fine, but Germany can't get their fuel from russia.
2288 2018-07-14 18:30:11 Ахах, что б моя мама так говорила Человеку выговориться надо, ей не обязательно, чтобы её слушали

2290 2018-07-14 18:30:06 Strike oil or strike out.
2291 2018-07-14 18:30:01 An angular, plausible orb made of oil paint that wants to know the date.
2292 2018-07-14 18:29:52 You have to stare back
2293 2018-07-14 18:29:49 checking out tuna 
 oil sheen one hundred m wide 
  probable  offshore
2294 2018-07-14 18:29:44 Free oil any day of the week!
2295 2018-07-14 18:29:38 Check you brake oil, it might be low .
2296 2018-07-14 18:29:38 Oil and lubrication systems are not only vulnerable to easy sabotage, but are critical in every machine with moving parts.
2297 2018-07-14 18:29:35 Sorry to hear that! The AKA @TheKratomAssn is working hard to overturn state bans, but doesn't help you now. I see CBD oil is legal for you. That helps MANY people with pain. DL-phenylalanine can also help with opiod tolerance to stretch the pain meds you may already have.
2298 2018-07-14 18:29:31 Just change the oil on my truck by myself, saved $60 bucks  feeling real American might get a bold eagle tattoo.... it was a Lexus tho which is Japanese but w/e
2299 2018-07-14 18:29:23 Soph has me ask a place what kind of oil they cook in and I told her that i was gonna ask it with an accent and say erl instead and she about lost it. The lady had no idea what i was trying to say 
2300 2018-07-14 18:29:21 the cool thing about owning a bald rat is that you can lubricate their skin with olive oil. lube your rat up
2301 2018-07-14 18:29:18 Well don’t save them especially for me... seems unfair on others... but if there’s any left next time I’m in... incidentally is that Old Engine Oil on the tap yet?
2302 2018-07-14 18:29:12 Thank you so much coming from you it means a lot. I am just a small fraction they are other guys behind the scenes burning oil 24/7 working on the report.
2303 2018-07-14 18:29:04 Donald Trump and the truth mixes together as good as Oil and Water does.
#LiarInChief #TrumpLies #Delusional #TrumpRussia
2304 2018-07-14 18:28:27 Hey buddy who were the architects of 9/11? They were not Iranian but Saudi’s. How then do you explain America’s love affair with Saudi’s? Could it be oil interests? Could it be Isreal’s influence?
2305 2018-07-14 18:28:17 My heart is torn about this. Good friends of mine work in the oil fields.
2306 2018-07-14 18:27:54 In the US, a lot of states are moving directly to renewables despite not having prior infrastructure. Oil companies are fighting utilities, States, Local Businesses, and losing.
2307 2018-07-14 18:27:46 Yo it's really gonna take Toyota 5 hours to change oil, do the tire rotation, and check my back right door's lock
2308 2018-07-14 18:27:19 @SenJohnMcCain 

I disagree with your opinions on Pres Trump and everything he does to include NATO.   Why should NATO nations give Russia billions $ for oil / n Gas they will use to build up their military and then NATO wants the US to spend billions to protect them?
Fair for us
2309 2018-07-14 18:27:07 The Saudis have NEVER been our friends.  We should terminate all military aid, stop buying any of their oil, and quit the war in Yemen
2310 2018-07-14 18:27:06 The FBI was doing something about it.  Still are. Turns out it has EVERYTHING to do w/ you and your campaign. (Ya know, the oil deal, the money laundering.... and maybe videos?  'Hi' to Epstein for me!)
2311 2018-07-14 18:27:04 Free oil for the rest of my life!!!
2312 2018-07-14 18:27:03 Will be interesting when a group of fn put together proposal to purchase all or part km, let the fun begin.. I secretly hope that Trump puts tarrifs in our oil and them we will see how much our resources make a diff in this country
2313 2018-07-14 18:27:01 I did a layer of aloe and then a layer of coconut oil and still suffered but at least it helped lol.
2314 2018-07-14 18:26:56 First team gives me free oil changes and they wash my car when I pick it up  they are the best
2315 2018-07-14 18:26:54 Yes, the Standing Rock Pipeline was Dakota Access. This new pipeline construction the the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is fighting is Keystone XL. Oil corps won’t leave us alone.
2316 2018-07-14 18:26:53 This hot oil treatment is the best 
2317 2018-07-14 18:26:51 Many more.they did this not b/c they support these.. they did this so that they themselves could be Moral high ground on USA. Then us citizens would think Communism in better light, commies want to trade oil with Germany(merkel) parts of Europe is losing bc of ideology not force.
2318 2018-07-14 18:26:49 Well good luck with that. I respect your opinions. I live close to US border in BC. The view from here looks like they will continue to screw us on lumber & oil.
2319 2018-07-14 18:26:23 i just open my lil roll on ball top oil near him....instant love anyone at fucking all in the world can lure my luck with scented oil
2320 2018-07-14 18:25:58 What the fuck
2321 2018-07-14 18:25:42 and soap...he really likes soap...and loses his fucking mind for scented oil
2322 2018-07-14 18:25:16 No one is saying they can't protest but when you either endanger other people and or impede the ability to make a living just like those green peace yahoos, I say lock them up, oil tankers are so close to their headquarters yet that's okay?,
2323 2018-07-14 18:24:59 Grapeseed oil!
2324 2018-07-14 18:24:59 @QuakerState oil change challenge #qs400 #sockrace978
2325 2018-07-14 18:24:50 Because not only could Obama not do it, he didn't want to do it. Nothing happened until Putin stepped in and stopped the illicit ISIS oil trade facilitated by Turkey. Obama is no friend to America.
2326 2018-07-14 18:24:48 Why do we have rising prices?? Supply and damand, they say? So we still import oil? Why, if we do? Prices up due to greed, IMHO. @SecretaryPerry #AmericaFirst 
2327 2018-07-14 18:24:46 A lot of dentists are snake oil salesmen in disguise.
2328 2018-07-14 18:24:31 Oil cleanser nya pake apa km
2329 2018-07-14 18:24:17 itlog na hindi raw dumidikit e puta yung kawali na ginagamit nila pinupunasan nila ng baking oil
2330 2018-07-14 18:24:10 when food was probably cooked in peanut oil and your mouth starts to get tingly 
2331 2018-07-14 18:24:05 @ruddkim also voted yes to #BillC48 which does not support Alberta oil
2332 2018-07-14 18:23:45 Tea tree oil has changed my life.
2333 2018-07-14 18:23:45 When Obama became president.. Pelosi immediately passed shovel ready and 40 other failed programs to the cost over 10 billion.. Big oil began directional drilling and fracking which caused many investments raising the stock market.. you don't know shit.
2334 2018-07-14 18:23:40 even Turkey has gone for S400 only secure its oil security from Rusia means Rusia could be a strategic partner for india in oil security too Sir in my view.
2335 2018-07-14 18:23:37 Getting oil changes is so trash. Can’t wait for flying cars that run on water.
2336 2018-07-14 18:23:35 Actually, it was more to harm HRC for her interfering in their opinion with Putin's election. Now as to DJT protecting Putin, he has put more sanctions on them than Obama, he has gotten countries that were buying oil from Russia to get it from us. So, I don't see it that way.
2337 2018-07-14 18:23:32 The first trillion dollar “company” won’t be Apple or Google, instead it’s Norway’s Oil Fund which just passed $1 trillion USD!

It’s fully owned by Norway’s citizens, of which each owns $192,000. Every year Norway can withdraw 3% which is $30 billion.
2338 2018-07-14 18:23:01 This is what happens to your country when you have oil. US rocks, Iraq sucks.
2339 2018-07-14 18:22:19 Don’t support Russia- support free & fair trade with your allies !! Buy oil & gas from your allies !!
2340 2018-07-14 18:22:18 Calumet is the south side, most dangerous.  It has a big lake but when boats cross it the propellors churn up oil or grease from all the industry.  I was there once under guidence of two men from my Mafia employer.  "The jackets is okay but take of the tie" before we entered then
2341 2018-07-14 18:22:12 Obama's disaster was created by the CRA and it's sub programs.. including fannie/Freddie and forced bank loans … Bush warned about it 17 times and was blocked by Dodd/Frank in the senate from regulation.. Obama has no policies that helped.. Big oil, Boeing raised the stocks..
2342 2018-07-14 18:22:05 Pal carajo el amor
2343 2018-07-14 18:22:00 Getting an oil change . Going to the nail shop when I leave here.
2344 2018-07-14 18:21:44 I need some Shampoo, Conditioner, and Coconut Oil  .... I gots hair now boss.
2345 2018-07-14 18:21:39 How about removing the palm oil, reducing the sugar content, increasing the cocoa content (from sustainable sources) for starters?
2346 2018-07-14 18:21:29 Be sure to lubricate the new filter's gasket with clean oil to prevent that in the future.

While you're in there check the mating surface of your filter to make sure there's no chunks of the old gasket that's caked on. It may cause an imperfect seal and lead to leaks.
2347 2018-07-14 18:21:28 \tPage 13481 ]\t\tby coming to this Legislature recognize the humanity that we call the running of the day for second reading at the Oil 1/4
2348 2018-07-14 18:21:26 Scott Pruitt was a useful oil asset with a get smart cone of silence phone booth in his office.
2349 2018-07-14 18:21:13 I'm just gonna pretend I don't need an oil change for right now lmao
2350 2018-07-14 18:21:10 While President Trump has vastly boosted oil output, Germany imports 70% of it's energy needs from RUSSIA! Making Russia richer by BILLIONS of dollars a year.

Thanks Angela!
2351 2018-07-14 18:21:01 I tink i wuld need more of dat oil...and soap 
2352 2018-07-14 18:20:53 People are angry in Saudi Arabia but they can’t speak. I blame the United States and Britain for allowing this because of greed and oil

2357 2018-07-14 18:20:22 Veggie Sauce and Spaghetti (or whatever pasta you like)

1 zucchini diced small
1 medium carrot diced small
1/2 onion diced small
1 or 2 tbsp olive oil
A bit of garlic and onion powder
1 can diced stewed tomatoes
Whatever pasta you like
2358 2018-07-14 18:20:09 No doubt. They'd get on my case too if they knew how much I like instant ramen from Asian markets. 

The hardest part is finding it made without palm oil. 
2359 2018-07-14 18:20:09 Theoran Fleury is in fact a very broken person. I've seen him share so much ignorant inaccurate stuff that he can't be taken seriously. Ask him how Trudeau has abandoned ranchers & oil and gas workers.... he won't be able to answer because it's not factual.
2360 2018-07-14 18:20:08 US .... perhaps there are brands that are available here & there?
no palm oil, soybean oil, carageen etc ....  Amy’s is looking good but would like more options
2361 2018-07-14 18:19:54 Probably not that much I just wanted to be more hands on and everyone and their dog is like oil changes are easy so
But apparently not
2362 2018-07-14 18:19:43 I put three in one oil on the troublesome screws. Hopefully it'll get in deep enough that the screws will release. What else can I do?
2363 2018-07-14 18:19:22 What is wrong in Africa we produce oil but we have to pay more than America or uk. Are we serious. I can't think far now #ghana #kenya
2364 2018-07-14 18:19:07 My favorite Palos Heights tradition - getting my hair done, then an oil change / car wash at Fuller’s. It’s going to rain today, and I’m still getting a car wash.
2365 2018-07-14 18:19:04 Now Turkana folks want oil money to be wired to their ATM accounts.

What Turkanas are showing us is the outcome of marginalization including educational marginalization. 

And we ain't seen nothin yet.
2366 2018-07-14 18:19:03 I rated Wind River higher than that, thought it was excellent. The scene at the Oil well is incredible.
2367 2018-07-14 18:19:02 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2368 2018-07-14 18:19:00 I have never been and now never will take my car there Megan.  I love my car that I got over a year and get my oil changes at the dealership I got it from!  I love my car too much to take it to any where else esp. now Jiffy Lube!
2369 2018-07-14 18:18:53 also in Albufeira there’s a restaurant that does this really good piri piri oil that will tie just about any dish together

2371 2018-07-14 18:18:48 Do the injections help? My husband keeps telling me to go to a pain management doc. The pain meds made my feet swell and didn't really help enough to offset that. I saw some hemp oil being used on the news yesterday. Would like to try that
2372 2018-07-14 18:18:43 In 2015 Obama lifted the 40 year ban on oil exports
US Oil Exports QUADRUPLED since the ban was repealed in 2015
Trump's trade war with China will reduce oil exports 
So once again THANKS OBAMA..
2373 2018-07-14 18:18:43 Mostly #GOP but some #Dems also are willing to sacrifice endangered wildlife for the blood lust of hunters and trappers and the greedy oil, gas and mining POS.  Each of us must support all organizations working to stop these corrupt evil people.

I’m pale, sweating, shaking coughing & spluttering. #dearcustomer still has to come to me as I’m trying to leave to ask where the olive oil is. I can barely think of my name right now, go away.
2379 2018-07-14 18:17:53 You’re forgetting we’ll still have  “ All “ our oil , electricity , water ,whisky ,gas ,gin  ,financial sector “ £2 trillion “ , salmon , shell fish , forestry etc and you will get not 1 % of it when we leave , pray tell just what do you have ?
2380 2018-07-14 18:17:44 Building at this point when non medical cbd derived from thousands of acres of hemp in Canada is going to flood the market and GMP facilities in Latin America et al producing medical grade thc oil is going to make for some of these LPs hitting the rocks and staying there?
2381 2018-07-14 18:17:31 The only mistake Dim Odimegwu Ojukwu made was not to allow Britain  take full control of our oil. By now, 50yrs later, we would’ve taken it back.
2382 2018-07-14 18:17:18 Do we not have a single member of Cabinet with a Science degree?
Why are ANY "naturopathic" practitioners paid ANYTHING by our Gov't? Our Gov't should be debunking "snake oil" sales types, not promoting them. These basics of Science should be taught to ALL in High School.
2383 2018-07-14 18:17:13 In desperate need of a new phone charger, toothpaste and oil change but don't feel like spending the money... however, $18.50 for 2 twisted teas yahoo no problem!!!!!:) :) :)
2384 2018-07-14 18:17:07 What y’all doing? I caught myself nodding off at the dealership waiting on an oil change  lol

2385 2018-07-14 18:17:05 Also, even if it did, on what planet does a cowboy hat represent oil and gas?  It's a fucking cowboy hat.
2386 2018-07-14 18:16:44 Kannete I need oil money
2387 2018-07-14 18:16:08 Who sells CBD Oil in Victoria BC

2388 2018-07-14 18:15:44 It was that radical firebrand rag @TheEconomist.  It showed #Trump 
(1) is *only* rich because of his daddy
(2) is not even *averagely* astute
(3) is a very good snake oil salesman.
2389 2018-07-14 18:15:36 Don't forget to push Crisco Oil who paid for your crooked organisation, Dr Phony.
2390 2018-07-14 18:15:36 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
2391 2018-07-14 18:15:20 disrupt lard oil
2392 2018-07-14 18:15:15 Selling all our oil to foreign countries meanwhile we are paying high prices for ful. What’s great about that!
2393 2018-07-14 18:15:14 Go to Take 5, you don’t have to get out of the car for the oil change.
2394 2018-07-14 18:15:12 Barcelona buying French players is like America invading the middle east for oil.
2395 2018-07-14 18:15:06 definitely time for an oil change... (not Mini)..
2396 2018-07-14 18:14:59 Lunch today: I sautéed chunks of onion, zucchini, green pepper with chopped celery in olive oil and seasonings. I added it to cooked loose ground round and ore-cooked, seasoned brown rice. Added red pepper flakes. #yum
2397 2018-07-14 18:14:55 These Turkana guys have a place in my heart. They insist.."pesa yetu 5% tupewe kwa kadi zetu za ATM...ikienda kwa serikali itakuliwa yote.." And to show their seriousness they have for the second time blocked all oil transport.
2398 2018-07-14 18:14:46 i just went through the most awkward oil change of my life and it was entirely me that made it awkward
2399 2018-07-14 18:14:44 You know it’s a heatwave in the UK when your coconut oil STILL hasn’t solidified in the jar.
2400 2018-07-14 18:14:24 Olive oil is bad for health.
2401 2018-07-14 18:14:21 Turkana's oil project is a powder keg that will explode soon.

2404 2018-07-14 18:14:10 has anyone tried cbd oil for their anxiety?
2405 2018-07-14 18:14:00 And, I've been thinking, a coherent story about UK's place in the 21st Century world, our role in EU. I'm thinking the argument about Brexit is between something like a religion and facts/logic. Oil & water, like trying to convince a true believer that homeopathy is placebo.
2406 2018-07-14 18:14:00 We are proud sponsors of @ArcAcademyPod! Listen to Markus and Liz discuss the herb/oil of the month, learn some folklore, and listen to interviews with movers and shakers in the pagan community.
2407 2018-07-14 18:13:47 I thought it was strange how Reilly would say "Oil oil oil" or "Ice Ice Ice" or "Sand Sand Sand" before receiving the hut. I couldn't figure out a trend to it...
2408 2018-07-14 18:13:43 Treating #Russia as a "pariah" was an #Obama foreign policy decision that #DeepState likes. The #RINOs like it for business and big oil reasons. The #MSM like it because it makes the #RussiaCollusion narrative sound more nefarious. @realDonaldTrump sees Russia as a competitor.
2409 2018-07-14 18:13:28 Uh if taco Bell is worse for you then McDonalds you need to stop drinking the BP oil spill water!
2410 2018-07-14 18:13:26 There is nothing worse than fish oil burps. NOTHING.
2411 2018-07-14 18:13:15 <0.1% of the fuel is from dino organic mass

the dinos statement isn't wrong

2413 2018-07-14 18:13:01 Iraq gov has blocked social media, possibly all internet, on day 7 of protests. (Day 10 if starting with July 5 Basra governate building protests demanding oil jobs).

2415 2018-07-14 18:12:50 me and @KingRutontheMic are going on an #AdultDate today that will consist of chores like getting an oil change and cleaning our cars out together 
2416 2018-07-14 18:12:48 They are just trying to cash out their oil business before the barrel of oil fell to 10 dollars due to EV exponential growth.
2417 2018-07-14 18:12:21 Dude! I loved you in Midnight Oil.
2418 2018-07-14 18:12:19 One of the best for sure. I also have that Dhara oil ad "jalebi" fresh in mind.
2419 2018-07-14 18:12:19 Hopefully you realize that the u.s oil production has been rising since 2009 right?
2420 2018-07-14 18:12:09 Ah, now your are reader if the mind and heart .  No Walsh you are just a speck of dust for  a brief moment on hearth.  Respect our POTUS. Go Learn how to change the oil in your car.  Keep busy
2421 2018-07-14 18:12:04 Big picture: Inflation has shot up over the past year owing to rising oil prices, higher rents, more expensive medical care and growing bottlenecks in the economy for skilled workers and certain key materials
2422 2018-07-14 18:11:59 My oil change literally took like 30 mins. Maybe less lol I’m usually stuck all damn day. And the guy gave me a discount on my new air filter. 
2423 2018-07-14 18:11:26 Purchased 2 bottles of sun bum oil. Both sprayers stopped working on day 2. Anyone else have this prob @TrustTheBum
2424 2018-07-14 18:11:17 Got a free sample of CBD oil at the farmers market and it’s amazing...I’m not high I’m just very contentedly putting away veggies and relaxing happily and watching tv like I guess people without depression can do every day?!?
2425 2018-07-14 18:11:10 You are not number 1 and you never will be all your countries are good for is oil that is why America invaded Iraq  at least Syria has Integrity and Assad can stand up to America with Russia .
2426 2018-07-14 18:11:03 I’ve been waiting 2 hours to get my oil changed
2427 2018-07-14 18:11:00 @matthewdelly next? I got your first Fosters Oil Can
2428 2018-07-14 18:10:32 I told my mom I read something about the benefits of flaxseed oil....so she immediatly bought a bottle, a book on it, and even got a bottle for my dog.
2429 2018-07-14 18:10:23 That was actually going on when Obama was president & he spoke about it.

Otherwise just find a coffee you love and BAM! 
If you follow keto you can add in mct oil, coconut oil, grass fed butter, etc. Otherwise however you like your coffee you’re golden

Service here sucks 4 hrs to get an oil change
2434 2018-07-14 18:09:52 What brand of essential oils do you use? Young Living makes a rollerball mix called Rutavala. It has an essential oil that is much stronger than lavender in it called Rue. They make capsules for sleep that contains the same as well. My husband had 13 surgeries so his body aches..

2437 2018-07-14 18:09:46 Last time gas was $1.36, a barrel of oil was approx. $137 - 2008. Now gas is $1.35 and a barrel of oil now is around $72. Explain that? #gasgouging
2438 2018-07-14 18:09:41 Also PSA, doTERRA’s Copiaba essential oil is amazzzzzzing for so many uses and I’ve slept like a freakin rock every time I’ve used it for physical pain/soreness  might be my new favorite oil!
2439 2018-07-14 18:09:39 You know what makes me sad? I saw interviews with you on a TV special about how the mafia was brought down in New York.

You seemed to be an intelligent man of character.

Why are you selling your soul and staining your history in law enforcement to defend a snake oil salesmen?
2440 2018-07-14 18:09:19 My Speedee has a vending machine in it with Top Ramen...who tf is buying ramen to go after getting their oil changed?
2441 2018-07-14 18:09:10 You will be surprised. I agree with you. EVs will at some point take over. Not necessarily BEVs tho, but yes, we agree on the principle. Oil is too precious to be burned in ICE's forever...
2442 2018-07-14 18:09:00 “Never bite the hand that feeds you”. #TPLF we’re ungrateful to America, they allied themselves to China. Think about it, who discovered #Ogaden Oil and gas. It was Sinclair Oil, an American company.
2443 2018-07-14 18:08:54 Charlie, hate to tell you that Saudi is our friends and they were not responsible for Bin Laden and the other extremist who happened to be born in Saudi Arabia. You need to lay off Saudi Arabia, they are forcing OPEC to raise output on Oil.

2445 2018-07-14 18:08:53 Its mostly a question of infastructure and availability at this point, a majority of infastructure is in oil, with how ingrained cronyism is i don't see how a move tp renewables will happen until building new infastructure is cheaper than running existing ones.
2446 2018-07-14 18:08:52 The President and his delegation will have a separate roundtable with some Dutch Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of companies based in Nigeria with a view to urging them to expand their investments, especially in agriculture, oil and gas in Nigeria. #PMBinTheHague @BuhariCentre
2447 2018-07-14 18:08:47 What, he can't pass any useful legislation at the state level, and his family can't even make gas stations fly? In the era of big oil? So glad he's in office.
2448 2018-07-14 18:08:33 I also know measuring CO2 next to an oil refinery vs in the middle of a green forest will result in different concentrations of CO2. The same goes for measuring temps. Biasing temps and CO2 measurements to prove an agenda is simple. Then we’re back to why do that? $ is the driver
2449 2018-07-14 18:08:23 ....beard oil, Marlon.
2450 2018-07-14 18:08:17 @Dodge Your cars are awesome but your service  wait it's nothing to laugh about, I'm currently on a 2 hr and counting wait for an oil change.

2463 2018-07-14 18:06:03 Essentail oils aint shit I bought a roll on oil for my feet called “Sleepy” and it did NOT put me to sleep for one second last night buuut 13% of proceeds go towards ending human trafficking so I’m okay with the purchase
2464 2018-07-14 18:05:57 They all want Israels oil and gas
2465 2018-07-14 18:05:55 Literally bought new tires for the car & guess what ...... it also needs an oil change 
2466 2018-07-14 18:05:48 Not that much. TBH, if you believe the cosmetics and beauty industry that using one product or another will give you great hair, it'll all be artificial - gotta start at diet and exercise first. High protein/oil rich stuff. Do cardio. Your hair will simply come out better.
2467 2018-07-14 18:05:47 Oil change 
2468 2018-07-14 18:05:38 Absolutamente estimado. Estas semanas estuve comprando. Lo q no tengo claro es a estos precios del oil como influye en los costos de la empresa..
2469 2018-07-14 18:05:30 Iraq was a proxy war for oil, we all knew this. And it actually created ISIS.

I'm more concerned with white supremacists domestic terrorists groups who are actually killing Americans.

The Iran deal was good, they were complying.

Refugees are welcome.

2474 2018-07-14 18:05:15 I hereon with kind advice Mr president pick a leaf from president kagame of Rwanda . Sometimes you need to be tough for some things to be done . Rwanda has no Gold ,No oil and is currently one of the works fastest growing nation .

2485 2018-07-14 18:04:16 Guyana has significant oil production potential. I hope they use the oil revenues properly and develop their people and country.

2492 2018-07-14 18:03:29 Sue, if Trump was a Putin puppet, why would he encourage Germany to buy oil from us, further destabilizing the Russian economy and potentially resulting in Putin not retaining his position? 

Think for yourself instead of regurgitating what the media tells you.
2493 2018-07-14 18:03:23 How is there “beard hair and tattoo oil”? Like what is it going to do for you tattoos that it does for your beard and hair?
2494 2018-07-14 18:03:06 oil of clove meant to be good. hot water bottle? stringer seugs than paracetamol i think! or a large whiskey!

2496 2018-07-14 18:02:36 I’m weak lol, tune in later I got you.  I might preach a little. I need the oil too so I can get some foreheads !
2497 2018-07-14 18:02:29 Can people just you know, not hate me because of certain other people I'm not cool with. Sorry they burned the bridge them self and acted like I lit the mf match, bitch you doused our bridge in oil and took a flamethrower to it
2498 2018-07-14 18:02:27 You think we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan for their oil, really? Keep in mind the UK were part of this as well, it was not just the US. Remember what the Iraqi people did after we pulled Sadam from a hole in a field, chose to hang him for the crimes against the people of Iraq
2499 2018-07-14 18:01:44 I spent the day making syrup of yarrow and red clover, as well as skin oil and tea. I love making stuff that's not only really helpful and tasty, but also not available in stores. It's rewarding af to know stuff noone else knows. >:3

2502 2018-07-14 18:01:22 If that wasn't what you meant, there would have been no point in even mentioning the oil industry and money in the same sentence.

2505 2018-07-14 18:00:39 Absolutely true today. Look at dietary cholesterol... before it was considered a killer, now the National Dietary Guidelines Committee says "Oops, our bad". Look at "Peak Oil". Look at mass human starvation claims in the 70's.
2506 2018-07-14 18:00:18 That said, the interesting historical fact: the Vineyard's racial integration (by island) likely dates back to the peculiar economics (and religious identity) of the first oil industry: whaling. 2/

2510 2018-07-14 18:00:00 @realDonaldTrump cheaper domestic oil/ gasoline will put a thriving US economy on steroids.
2511 2018-07-14 17:59:56 It's the same old "all deniers are funded by big oil" argument.

You didn't say that exactly, but close enough.

2519 2018-07-14 17:58:49 You may be right. My point was solely why bears are always associated with special interest. Koch brothers, BIG OIL, ICE makers, etc. Tesla's going bust, while having a higher market cap than Ford or GM. Ridiculous! No big oil causes that. The comparisons were made by others...
2520 2018-07-14 17:58:49 I hope he sees how a country should be run, and how countries make good use of oil...

2522 2018-07-14 17:58:38 The USD liquidity crisis is spreading across middle east.  Iran, Turkey, now Iraq.....

The destabilizing of that entire region could send oil  into orbit powering the inflation story in USA, markets downward ....


2523 2018-07-14 17:58:38 No but even worse it puts oil into the ocean when we drill there and it spills or it spills when we ship it over the ocean
2524 2018-07-14 17:58:33 He wanted that real estate because of oil connections. It’s a front. Keeping looking into it and asking questions. It’s not making money through golf.
2525 2018-07-14 17:58:11 Breaking News! 
My van has been cleared of all tools and debris. It has sustained a light cleaning and oil change. I know! It's a miracle!!!!!
2526 2018-07-14 17:58:11 Remember when the oil spill that pumped a shit ton of oil into the gulf was the worst thing you’d ever done?

Well it is, but this is definitely the second. It’s a far, far second because you polluted the fucking gulf cuz you couldn’t be bothered to use basic caution. Fuckheads.
2527 2018-07-14 17:57:56 just got an oil change and everything checked out on mine...$40

2532 2018-07-14 17:57:24 Just for those in top 1%.  The rest of us have to pay increase cost for almost everything due to US tariff’s and lack of a cogent oil supply problem.  Are we suppose to use coal to power our cars?

2535 2018-07-14 17:57:15 Some guy next to me in this food court was talking about how his mechanic said he needed his brakes changed and windshield wipers replaced. And then he said “yea imma just get the oil changed”. I actually felt this one
2536 2018-07-14 17:56:41 Was in Walmart for an hour. Came out gas price up.40 a gallon! Maybe we could keep some of that oil.
2537 2018-07-14 17:56:36 พอเข้าใจเลยค่ะ ความขี้เกียจนี่ตัวปัญหาจริงๆเลยนะคะ แต่ก็มีตลอดอยู่ดี555555/โอเคค่ะ งั้นออยจะจำว่าอีกหนึ่งวันพี่มุกจะเขียนให้อ่านสินะคะ ฟฟฟฟฟ
2538 2018-07-14 17:56:33 It would be nice if we kept enough of the oil to drive the price back down to a dollar a gallon.
2539 2018-07-14 17:56:24 Get back to Tracey island, Thunderbird 4 needs an oil change.
2540 2018-07-14 17:55:54 Let me help them out here.
1. To solidify their partnership
2. To consolidate the two world powers
3. To coordinate how to influence and hack the mid-terms
4. Lift sanctions, creating global oligarchy & 45 finally getting his 19% of Rosfnet oil once sanctions are lifted.
2541 2018-07-14 17:55:51 Love that pic I need to do a oil painting of it !!!!

2551 2018-07-14 17:54:19 I watched a debate in the EU Parliament about Trump's tariffs on olive oil.  Instead of discussing possible ways to peacefully negotiate the matter all they came up with were threats and possible punishment. They run true to form with bullying to get their own way.

2554 2018-07-14 17:54:15 Remember the stone Jacob used for his pillows (e.g. REST) and poured oil (e.g. THE SPIRIT) in Genesis 28:18 in the place called “Bethel” meaning “House of God” in Genesis 28:19. Stone set for a pillar to be God’s House (e.g. HIS CHURCH) Jacob, promise seed of Isaac Romans 9:7-13

2556 2018-07-14 17:54:02 Maybe too simple, but I’d have a whole loaf of really good sourdough, dipped in olive oil. With wine, obviously.
2557 2018-07-14 17:53:59 -“And garlic, salt, pepper, olive oil, wine vinegar…” All things they have lying around in the cabinets. Small, simple ingredients he’d have once used to make a grand feast. Belatedly, while holding the bottles of herbs to his chest, “And the grill.”
2558 2018-07-14 17:53:52 We the nation are not depending on the Saudis for anything.
 the Saudis had infiltrated our government with money and corrupted our system has nothing to do with our oil supply.

2566 2018-07-14 17:52:36 @Bryony_Blake what’s the best primer for 40yr old oily skin please. Been using Laura Mercier oil free but still v shiny x
2567 2018-07-14 17:52:35 Interesting but why does it matter?? An oil fund supported by a country of 5 million with an army, police service and monopoly within its own borders vs a company created by two hippies in a garage?? I know which of these two stories impressed me... (don’t care about google)
2568 2018-07-14 17:52:28 You know oil is a finite non-renewable resource right?
2569 2018-07-14 17:52:11 Mct oil medium chain triglyceride it provides energy, helps metabolism and breaks down fat.
2570 2018-07-14 17:52:06 I have learned the hard way just how indelible Australian Red Clay is. I was trying to infuse an oil for a lip stain. I have spent hours bleaching the sink, been scrubbing my hands/arms and have had to throw away some containers, rubber gloves and my washing up bowl 
2571 2018-07-14 17:52:05 Exactly! It's ridiculous to say that a high school kid standing in the air conditioning deserves the same pay as a green horn in the oil field...where they actually work busting their @$$ in the heat/ cold, and all weather conditions! (Socialist) give me give give (earn it!)
2572 2018-07-14 17:52:02 When did Trudeau start controlling the price of oil?
2573 2018-07-14 17:51:45 Yes! Daughter..1yr of Dr. not being able to fix thyroid levels. 2 months on cbd oil..everything normal. Doc won't admit cbd helped. Looking to add keto to really amp up health!

2576 2018-07-14 17:51:32 Venezuela has support from Russia and China and is a major oil producer. you can't just waltz in like its a garden. First you create a bad image of the leader of the country make sanctions then move in like Libya
2577 2018-07-14 17:51:30 I've been at it for like 3 hours apparently I can't even do a shitty little fucking oil change properly
I think didn't put the oil filter back on properly
2578 2018-07-14 17:51:26 Smug oil paintings. The best
2579 2018-07-14 17:51:25 So, you're not even a northerner..  And you're comfortably speaking on our behalf. Remember this proportions. Fuel pump price and crude oil price, exchange rate and recession etc.
2580 2018-07-14 17:51:08 Oil change was a no-go. Dealership was super busy then I tried Walmart almost 4 hr wait. I asked my uncle and he'll do it next Sunday for the cost of the oil and filter. And we'll get something to eat
2581 2018-07-14 17:51:03 Like changing the oil on your car,
you must tune-up your air-conditioner once a year...... or they don’t work
2582 2018-07-14 17:51:03 Boom: 

US on pace to be number one exporter of crude oil, more than Saudi Arabia and Russia

Awesome news, the less dependent we are on Saudi (who financed and planned 9/11) and Russia (who tried to disrupt our elections) the better!

2583 2018-07-14 17:50:28 I’ve got one too. Mederma & vit E oil helped me but it doesn’t go away all together. My surgeon actually tried to hide mine in the crease on my neck. Still visible but less so...
2584 2018-07-14 17:50:23 your thoughts should be with the real people of the world..when big oil and 45 have destroyed it, what are you or your (shudder) children going to use...flying to Mars???
2585 2018-07-14 17:50:18 Gettin this well needed oil change , pay dis car note and hit my niece bday party is the plan for the day
2586 2018-07-14 17:50:17 The foreign oil companies that jumped into running Iraq oil reserves after the Iraq war are evacuating..what a shame, gonna have to stop stealing the IRAQ peoples natural resources. A war crime by the way.
2587 2018-07-14 17:50:14 Newman residents! Bring in a used oil filter and receive a free oil filter along with a free oil container or oil filter recycling container!!

2588 2018-07-14 17:50:09 The Iranian Nuke Deal was detrimental to the Russian economy as it increased Iran’s ability to export oil which, combined with increased US production, drove the market price down and sent Russia’s economy into the gutter. Shocking that you and Trump would find that bad.
2589 2018-07-14 17:50:09 @realDonaldTrump 
Sir, Iran is threatining the oil companies south Iraq, when will you change the regime ?
2590 2018-07-14 17:49:56 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating Fat cakes instead of rubbing the oil on his head.

Iraq: $54

2608 2018-07-14 17:47:00 It’s like oil and water... I can’t express all 800 thoughts that are in my mind without creatively doing so and in the process sharing it with the world... I need you to accept that.
2609 2018-07-14 17:46:44 reall???  maybe you need tocome to the understanding that we all know what you are resisting..when you favor billionaires and their agendas, real people resist....the mess with immigrants is because of global warming..we know it, you know it, big oil knows it and has for decades.

2615 2018-07-14 17:45:09 It’s all about the judges-

Don’t forget the HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS of oil reserves the Russians want access to buy cannot get due to sanctions
2616 2018-07-14 17:45:00 3. Govt owns land near govt offices,  rail stations. Can they have solar panels and supply additional power to EV charging station to reduce oil usage?

2619 2018-07-14 17:44:44 What's the goal; fast, or most like fresh?
Fast is clearly microwave, but does tend to make it chewy. Oven/toaster oven tend to dry it more. Cast iron skillet with just enough oil to make sure it doesn't stick is usually most like fresh from the oven. Luck!

2627 2018-07-14 17:43:58 There is a way to solve that last one - enforcing the sanctions on the books and adding to them. The Russian economy was in deep trouble until oil prices started to rise. We could sanction them in to a deep hole pretty quickly.

2639 2018-07-14 17:42:13 Hey I’d love a good fragrance oil! Cheaper than department store perfume but works just as well!
2640 2018-07-14 17:42:04 Really amazes me that you actually believe this. All those countries invaded for oil etc. The bullies of the World and you talk about peace?
2641 2018-07-14 17:41:58 I’m more of an extra virgin olive oil kind of guy myself
2642 2018-07-14 17:41:52 thanks to @brittsus i tanned today using coconut oil and geeeeez i’m crispy 
2643 2018-07-14 17:41:41 You have lost your d@mn mind if you think that a cashier standing in the air conditioning deserves as much pay as an oil field workers start out pay....
2644 2018-07-14 17:41:39 Yeah, that was after a pretty mean jeep trail that ripped out one of my AC lines. Finally made it off the mountain to the lake bed and did a shit ton of sweeping donuts until my lifters were ticking from oil starvation. Nice pics! Thule does make a great product.
2645 2018-07-14 17:41:32 It'd be so embarrassing if I died from choking on goddamn fish oil pills make it smaller & less smelly pls 
2646 2018-07-14 17:41:28 It looks like he’s pushing a shopping cart shaped for an oil barrel. And, apparently this is an actual place!
2647 2018-07-14 17:41:10 B12 for sure. Also Algal oil for Omega 3. Plenty of sun or consider plant based D3+K2 (for all diets). Avoid processed seed oils. If avoiding soy (I find I am ok w it) include pea protein for lysine as other vegan protein source low in lysine.
2648 2018-07-14 17:41:09 Lol same. I spilled some sort of oil on them and they literally fell apart.
2649 2018-07-14 17:41:07 I believe in Norway’s oil museum The Netherlands is specifically mentioned as a nearby country which failed to do this 
2650 2018-07-14 17:41:04 Maybe. I think the sdr will just be the medium for countries to do trade and buy assets like oil with rather than the dollar. Bitcoin and etc will be for the masses and etc I bet.
2651 2018-07-14 17:40:56 5 mins to go here at the Crown Oil Arena. Been a quick, pulsating game this far. Score remains @RochdaleHornets 32 - 44 @LeighCenturions

2654 2018-07-14 17:40:47 Get coconut oil shampoo and conditioner. That makes your shit silky smooth. Don't forget about to rub keratin into your mane too.
2655 2018-07-14 17:40:46 The Fed balance sheet, is it out of balance?  If you consider the peak oil concept, and use the theory that once half of all the worlds oil reserves are diminished using an average, gravity will kick in and make the price of oil per barrel move to high to fast that the world will
2656 2018-07-14 17:40:38 Nigerians need to be educated on life after Oil.
2657 2018-07-14 17:40:35 They are the leaders....we follow, wait and hope.

2661 2018-07-14 17:40:06 The dealer is fucken dragging with my car like does it really take you more than a damn hour for a oil change 
2662 2018-07-14 17:39:51 Yeah. They told me I needed a new one when I got my oil changed last month but I’ve been putting it off.

2667 2018-07-14 17:39:24 Don't be a cry , come I can help out with Palm oil, 
2668 2018-07-14 17:38:59 Shame on MacDonalds and the company’s who using palm oil 
2669 2018-07-14 17:38:58 I did not claim anything about the entire planet; I clearly said it was the US.

Show me where oil companies have spent significant money in third-world countries to convince people AGW isn't happening.

You've shown no evidence at all, yet seem to think you've "won" an argument.

2672 2018-07-14 17:38:19 Okay friendly POC, it's time to admit we've been trying to make the "white" race extinct. Making them buy SUVs that use oil from mostly Muslim countries; slowly raise CO², altering the climate and making food harder to grow. Their only chance is to reduce their carbon footprints.

2675 2018-07-14 17:37:55 Wash your hair less. When you keep washing your hair often you strip off it's natural oil. Wash it every other week( 2 times a month) use castor oil. Spray your hair with water and put a teaspoon measurement of it
2676 2018-07-14 17:37:46 $30 full synthetic oil change, oil and air filter, and fluid top offs. So thankful for a father that taught us general car maintenance.
2677 2018-07-14 17:37:29 Seems like it would---if we had a normal president. But we have a career criminal & he'll do what Putin wants because he's upside down in debt to Russians.Also, he wants his cut of Russia/Exxon oil deal as soon as he can get those sanctions lifted. Billions!
2678 2018-07-14 17:37:07 They’re men. Men with oil.

2680 2018-07-14 17:37:00 beans stew. ..you cook the beans separately, make onion and tomato sauce with any meat of your choice; we usually use smoked fish(salmon), and then you pour the cooked beans in and let it blend... I love using palm oil.
2681 2018-07-14 17:36:27 I just spent 60 some bucks, 4 hours, 2 gallons of sweat, braved 14 spiders in the effort to change my oil & air filter = wasn't able to make anything happen.  #modernmale #sorrydad #sorrygrandpa #sorrygreatgrandpa

2695 2018-07-14 17:35:32 I wouldn’t use olive or coconut oil on the face. Too heavy. Try rosehip or jojoba oil w/helichrysum (great for scarring too). Could be hormonal too if you’re on BC
2696 2018-07-14 17:35:10 Doing everything but studying rn. At least I finally got my oil changed...
2697 2018-07-14 17:35:05 Try magnolia tissue oil from pep

2699 2018-07-14 17:34:50 By the time I get to the egg there’s still too much oil in the pan and my stove too small for another pan 
2700 2018-07-14 17:34:46 Unfortunately,the puppy past very early this morning. We did all we could do to save him.Thank you,all for advice and prayers. If anyone knows of a small breed pup in need of a good home please inbox me.Thank you Jessica Ashley May for the oil .
2701 2018-07-14 17:34:45 I actually used a lot of natural products such as eggs, avocados, muesli, olive oil, carrot oil, castor oil and a few Mizani products x

2705 2018-07-14 17:34:07 I just wish you would concentrate on finding more oil.
2706 2018-07-14 17:34:02 They are NOT Express Lanes! They still take your car from you for a whole day, let the lot boy drive it around for 2 hours burning your gas, change all the radio presets, and bring it back dirtier than you dropped it off. Then when you get home, it drips oil on the garage floor.
2707 2018-07-14 17:33:56 Furthermore, compare the state visits to places like China and Saudi Arabia with the treatment we get from these British snivels.
2708 2018-07-14 17:33:55 Matte foundations. I almost despise them now. I'm an oil monster & thought matte was the only way. It is not. Powder works wonders over glowy foundations. Also blotting helps.

2710 2018-07-14 17:33:42 Norway is a small country with large oil wealth that has been homogeneous for almost all its history and has an overwhelmingly white population even today, as many immigrants are white Europeans.  They don’t deal with regular and massive influx of illiterate peasants.

2723 2018-07-14 17:32:15 How about a socialist state?  ND owns a very successful bank and grain elevators, and is working on an oil refinery.  Corp farming is not allowed.
I lived for many years among these hard working, intelligent folks who go for the practical.
We can all learn from them!

2753 2018-07-14 17:28:44 The point to my post is that the solar industry has the potential to replace coal as an employer, reduce our pollution and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Instead, we are listening to the coal lobby and investing in a process we know is running out of fuel.

2756 2018-07-14 17:28:08 Can you substitute Coconut Oil for the Butter?
2757 2018-07-14 17:27:53 Trump criticizing Germany for buying gas and oil from Russia. Then expecting us to defend them from Russia. Why are you not worried about China. Far bigger threat. The left projects to the right what they are guilty of. They seem to be real nervous about Trump and Putin talking.
2758 2018-07-14 17:27:42 listen I get that coconut oil is supposed to be really good for your hair & skin but your girl is allergic and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a quality product that won’t kill me

2784 2018-07-14 17:23:48 Elevated oil prices is the only reason why Nigeria supports the fiction of maintaining an independent monetary policy, allowing the free movement of capital, and fixing its exchange rate at the same time.

The current tiff over FAAC is one of the hidden costs of this fairy tale.

2798 2018-07-14 17:21:30 But why oil marketing co are increasing price inspite of reduction in oil prices recently
2799 2018-07-14 17:21:14 I cut bulk veg oils and degraded n-6s first (i.e. anything heated, baked etc.), then watch the rest less urgently, e.g. nuts, poulty, pork, olive oil, with moderate amounts. Perhaps best to go really low for a while, for release of n-6 stored in adipose. (We don't really know).

2822 2018-07-14 17:16:05 I’m just really upset that Tea Tree Oil is really $15. I can never re-up immediately because it’s just so hard to pay that for a little bottle.
2823 2018-07-14 17:16:05 There is treasure to be desired and oil(value commodity) in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spends it up.
2824 2018-07-14 17:16:03 -don't over wash your hair
-wash your hair every 3 days
-apply coconut oil before you wash your hair and leave it on for about an hour(the longer you leave it,the softer it will be)
-if you don't have coconut oil, you can apply castor oil, this helps your hair grow faster

2828 2018-07-14 17:15:24 If it's not for you, it's terrible. Men can smell great, if you're into that. It's just that more skin oil = more bacteria food = more bacterial waste = more smell, so T havers generally need a higher standard of hygiene.
2829 2018-07-14 17:15:16 Naw just castor oil but I might pick up some of that later

2835 2018-07-14 17:14:44 They took the beef suet (or whatever the fatty ingredient was ) out of the oil years ago because of the food police crowd. That's why they don't taste as good. For the record, I get a side salad instead of fries when I get a combo.  ;-)
2836 2018-07-14 17:14:41 The Broom should sweep the litters,the waste and the garbage it encounters and not pluck the eyes of the sweeper. 
 The Broom must not be stained with oil or blood for it to sweep so clean. 
 The Broom must be Broom and not swords or chains or else it’s not Broom.

2838 2018-07-14 17:14:26 Depression is when your engine isn't powering up. It might take a few pushes, a oil change, or you may have to take yourself to a loving engineer to fix you right up. If all doesn't work, getting a new engine isn't a bad idea. It is a fresh new start on your continuing journey!
2839 2018-07-14 17:14:11 I been using emergen-Zzzz drinks, Its mostly melatonin but some reason it works better for me than taking the same dose of melatonin capsules..also hit my high cbd low thc oil pen. Then I read for an hour or two. falling asleep has always been really hard for me too :(

2842 2018-07-14 17:14:02 You're trying to tell the world that #Zionist #Israel isn't genocidal? Your crazy leaders would even use nukes if our western leaders gave them the blessing. That will have to wait until the oil & gas have run out!
2843 2018-07-14 17:13:56 The R10 billion investment from Saudi Arabia 90% of engineers in the oil refinery must be SA citizens.
SA businessmen must given opportunities to buy majority shares. That's my wish.
2844 2018-07-14 17:13:46 Uhhh Rapid Clear literally saved my skin. My skin is clear and vibrant now. I've only been using it this summer, but I have no issues with dryness. I use an oil cleanser before and hydrate with hyaluronic acid and Korean snail cream.
2845 2018-07-14 17:13:40 Oil change done on the KTM. Must do a better job of keeping an eye on the oil level as it was running pretty low.

2849 2018-07-14 17:12:49 Well stop oligarchs and those with the powers taking lands for mineral resources, agriculture or oil pushing entire societies of people away and you wouldn't have refugees or immigrants & then hire mercenaries to kill those fleeing.
2850 2018-07-14 17:12:49 I started refuting human caused climate change 30 years ago. Remember chlorofluorocarbons and the hole in the ozone layer or was that before you were born? The “sky is falling” BS has been pushed my entire life. In the 1970’s we were gonna run out of oil. US is exporting LNG now.
2851 2018-07-14 17:12:44 Is that true the government let Chinese get away with taking the oil off shit using it to cook and sell it to people
2852 2018-07-14 17:12:28 Why should Norway not be worried? Contiguous border & are biggest oil producer outside of MidEast & seriously rich in nat resources. 
#NATO has added 17 members over the original 12 w/ other countries still seeking membership.  4/
2853 2018-07-14 17:12:17 You can use vitamin E oil! I had stitches on my forehead when my brother threw a rock at me  but I got rid of the scar by getting the vitamin E pills and breaking it open and putting the oil on my scar to sit over night! It takes a week or two but works!
2854 2018-07-14 17:12:05 Absolutely untrue.
I almost can't beleive you're saying cowboy hats represent "oil and gas", and you have to pass a test before donning one. Is it partisan blindness? I thought you were better than this.
2855 2018-07-14 17:12:04 Tooth is killing me, might use clove oil but I really don’t think I hate myself enough for that again
2856 2018-07-14 17:11:51 "For a country sitting on an ocean of oil & gas, a "peaceful" nuclear program is meaningless."

I bet it must've felt very philosophical when spewing this drivel.

Like it was a revolutionary recipe he needed to know.

2876 2018-07-14 17:09:47 What if...we, idk, separate health care from health insurance? I have car insurance for catastrophic events, I do my own car care by giving it gas, oil, cleanings etc. 

Also, wanting the government not to do something is not the same as not wanting it to be done
2877 2018-07-14 17:09:43 Tryna even out my summer glow and had to execute a bee coming for my coconut oil...

2886 2018-07-14 17:08:50 Trump ended the Iranian deal for no good reason. Except it helped Russia out tremendously. Their economy is in tatters, increasing the price of oil is their only way out.  India is not going along with the US on this. Expect China to take the place as the new world leader now.
2887 2018-07-14 17:08:45 When they say the economy is GREAT AGAIN? Does that mean that oil companies are getting rich? Importers/Exporters? Because #gasprices are ridiculous.
2888 2018-07-14 17:08:33 Pete awkwardly danced his way over to the bedside, searching for some kind of body lotion or massage oil, anything to make this a better experience for her. 

"I don't care...who you are...where you're from..." he sang along quietly.

2916 2018-07-14 17:05:43 What about wages? Did they go up? Since you pissed off Mexico our produce is going to up. And since you pissed off Canada our gas and oil will go up. So when will these big corporations give their employees a living wage instead of giving it back to the broad of directors.
2917 2018-07-14 17:05:40 “Hows your day going?” 
Well I almost ran over the guy at the oil change place because my leg wanted to have a spasm so I’d say it’s going great :)
2918 2018-07-14 17:05:31 I have never been hard up for a man but right now is one of those times. I wish he was here so he could take my car to get an oil change. I don’t feel like getting up
2919 2018-07-14 17:05:15 เชิญชมที่เฟสบุ๊คค่ะ อิอิอิ
2920 2018-07-14 17:05:15 YOUR A DEMOCRAT , HILLARY LOST , BLAME , RUSSIA , FATE , GLOBAL WARMING , OIL. COMPANIES , ME OR TEA PARTY , THIS IS AMERICA , PEOPLE VOTED , YOUR AN ADULT GET OVER IT !
2921 2018-07-14 17:05:03 hm for some reason my genius strategy of putting on coconut oil moisturizer and continuing to eat things I know make me sick isn't curing my skin issues, wtf..
2922 2018-07-14 17:04:50 @IndianOil_Delhi @IndianOilcl  one of your petrol pump always tries to scam customers . Indian oil, bakhtawar chowk, Gurgaon . @consumerforum_
2923 2018-07-14 17:04:46 @oil_areeya ทำไมกูต้องทำตาม 55555 มึงทำมั้ย
2924 2018-07-14 17:04:44 when you open a new bottle of beard oil and it smells amazing.
2925 2018-07-14 17:04:30 If I order Indian food I ask that they use vegetable oil instead of ghee
2926 2018-07-14 17:04:23 Oil paintings by American painter, George Bodine :)
2927 2018-07-14 17:04:08 Have you ever tried using CBD products?! It’s a hemp product but has literally nothing to do with weed and it’s super good for anxiety!! You can get it in a little vape for when you need it instantly or they sell like gummy’s, lollipops, or oil you can use in food and drinks!
2928 2018-07-14 17:04:00 Trump is to truth as oil is to water. #Trump #Resist
2929 2018-07-14 17:03:47 Get Ready For The Third "Oil Shock"
 
A war between Iran and Israel (and its U.S.-led allies) would wreak havoc on the oil market. That’s because Iran holds a very powerful card...
2930 2018-07-14 17:03:44 Every few months, I remember that in the late 90’s the Reno City council approved a Beverly Hillbillies themed casino but the deal fell apart because the actor who played Jethro (who was behind the whole thing) wanted an oil derrick to shoot fire like 200 feet in the air. Just...
2931 2018-07-14 17:03:44 Thank you. I don't know speed at which info/Intel gets to Earth from Orbit but remember capture of Osama was monitored live by Obama and his Generals. With our oil money can't we have that?. Even U.S Border Control uses such a system. We even see this on TV.
2932 2018-07-14 17:03:09 1 in 8 households in the US have food insecurity. That’s over 10% of the population, a statistic that mostly affects marginalized people. And yet you defend billionaires who poison the earth with oil waste.
2933 2018-07-14 17:02:54 Boost oil prices. Weaken global consensus for climate action.
2934 2018-07-14 17:02:45 if u honk @me 025 seconds after the light turns green Im going to put my vehicle on park,adjust my seat,check my tyre pressure,change my oil,return some emails,read a book,eat a snack,brush my teeth,nap,change shoes and fix my make up.
2935 2018-07-14 17:02:30 Yeah, just like all that stupid hype about  hafnium-178m2 nuclear isomers. Military experts had visions of nuclear hand grenades and other WMD in convenient 'fun size' packages. Until they found out the release mechanism was snake oil.
2936 2018-07-14 17:02:29 No, socialism also demands the seizing of production by the government. See Venezuela’s taking over the oil industry for example. They fired all existing executives and put pro Chavez people in charge. Something China doesn’t even do with all companies in China.
2937 2018-07-14 17:02:20 @johnrobertsFox question REALLY important
DID U SEE how flustered #Trump was?
#Crimea #GolanHeights  
Israel PUSHING HARD behind scenes OLIGARCHS Israeli/Russian want 2 steal #Syria's oil want 2 complete theft of #Palestine
*Genie Energy*
@CNN @SRuhle @LelandVittert @AlexWitt
2938 2018-07-14 17:01:56 ก็คือค้นพบว่าตัวเองเหมาะกับวิชาคำนวณมากกว่าวิชาความจำ ถถถถ
2939 2018-07-14 17:01:54 fuck you and your funky ass oil change
2940 2018-07-14 17:01:52 Generous, caring and compassionate?!? To who exactly?! You have a history as a nation of creating false wars in order to steal oil and impose your idealism where it wasn't wanted.
Then get pissed when countries retaliate and think we should owe you for it?! Gtf.
2941 2018-07-14 17:01:37 So why is it that the big oil SHELL is decommissioning  and selling off its assets 64 billion half year profit but mostly in other countries... You obviously didn't get the memo
2942 2018-07-14 17:01:34 I want some oil
2943 2018-07-14 17:01:26 Pues se crea un gas oil para transportistas.
Pero los turismos no.
Prácticamente todos los taxistas que renuevan sus vehículos los cambian por híbridos con gasolina o glp.
2944 2018-07-14 17:01:12 รู้สึกอยากหาแอคทิวิตี้ใหม่ๆ อยากลองหาอะไรทำใหม่ๆ แบบที่ใจอยากทำ ไม่ใช่เพราะบิกให้ทำหรือใครแนะนำหรือใครมาสั่ง(ให้ทำ)
2945 2018-07-14 17:01:04 Ships are only involved when you import oil. With a pipeline the risk of environmental degradation is SO MUCH FUCKING SMALLER and you are not importing from countries with lax enviro regulations
2946 2018-07-14 17:01:04 I stared shaving my legs with coconut oil and now I’m always paranoid that I smell like an almond joy... which isn’t such a bad thing idk
2947 2018-07-14 17:01:00 Even the unionist Sir Ian now admits there are many decades of oil left, thought he was the gospel during 2014, why isn't he gospel to unionists now? I can tell you, because it doesn't fit their cognitive dissonance rhetoric.#bigenoughrichenoughsmartenough
2948 2018-07-14 17:00:58 Eyes on the big prize. Israel is using ISIS as a buffer to the north on Hezbollah and Syria. But, the big prize is that ISIS just set off bombs in Saudi Arabia. Higher oil prices anyone. US must learn that in this region murder is fine if it results in a windfall, values matter.
2949 2018-07-14 17:00:53 Old news - that's from last year (November 24, 2017), and it's a garbage article, plus label in photo above appears to show a garbage fish oil supplement (note how thumb hides EPA/DHA content) -  garbage in garbage out.
2950 2018-07-14 17:00:38 Gotta oil up the beard? Lol
2951 2018-07-14 17:00:29 When there are 3 pretty cute guys doing oil changes and you get stuck with the 4th guy....
2952 2018-07-14 17:00:25 Darn  !!!! I’ve just invested 175k in a Nigerian oil field .

2956 2018-07-14 17:00:13 I’m tweeting a lot because I’m waiting for an oil change  if you can’t tell lmao
2957 2018-07-14 17:00:10 I remember being flattered when the oil/incense guy called me queen 
2958 2018-07-14 17:00:03 se imaginan oler a moroccan oil 24/7??? ese es mi sueño en la vida 
2959 2018-07-14 16:59:54 had this dream I was working at denny’s, me n this dude were making pancakes and cuh used oil instead of butter to grease the pan, idky I was so heated that he did that. So we both squared up and I smacked dude w a spatula. 

Moral: grease the pan w butter not oil for pancakes
2960 2018-07-14 16:59:54 What could help oily skin? I use the oil free acne wash and it does try out my skin, but my face gets suuuuper oily after I put on moisturizer.
2961 2018-07-14 16:59:47 Still impossible to liquidate quickly. Manager said they’re like an oil tanker: if there’s a storm ahead, they’ll just have to weather it. Even if they can foresee a correction in the market it is too costly to do any significant changes to the portfolio

2963 2018-07-14 16:59:34 youtube kundalini yoga or simple talk thru meditations. i also love my oil diffuser ill use some eucalyptus and lavender mixed together and thatll help (you can get this stuff on amazon for cheap). i also try to take vitamins like B12 and D3 that boost energy.
2964 2018-07-14 16:59:32 Fresh

Oil Filter

Feelin like I got me a new truck
2965 2018-07-14 16:59:30 Takin my dad 2hrs just to change my oil when he could have just took it to jiffy lube
2966 2018-07-14 16:59:30 You obviously don’t know any senior O&G people. The review of royalty payments which ended in the assessment that they were fair after all... started the exodus. As if the lesson we learned when Stelmack did the same thing wasn’t obvious. Oil companies closed the wallets then too
2967 2018-07-14 16:59:23 @RealDonad_Trump Mr. President, can you do something about fuel prices without killing the price of oil?
2968 2018-07-14 16:59:19 Dear @Twitter  Give this man "account of the year" award
2969 2018-07-14 16:59:12 My friend works in oil, and has stated if it was depleting, then BP would not be investing the billions they are investing right now!
2970 2018-07-14 16:59:03 We drained the oil snank (snail tank)
2971 2018-07-14 16:58:56 Idk if I didn’t use it long enough or use the right one but oil cleansing DIDDD NOOOTTT work for my oily ass skin. Moisturizing with an oil did not make my face less oily.
2972 2018-07-14 16:58:36 yeah this spaghetti OIL

2975 2018-07-14 16:58:15 Here we go, another 'Big in Oil' dude, NS O&G has made London very rich, how come it's worthless to Scotland? Have you seen how many new fields are to come on board? Have you read how profits are now greater? This level of non intelligence is embarrassing to our country
2976 2018-07-14 16:58:10 What are your thoughts on lush cleansers ? ALSO PLEASE ADD THE BODY SHOP TEA TREE OIL FOAMING CLEANSER TO THE LIST IT RUINED MY SKIN FOR A MONTH
2977 2018-07-14 16:57:44 U.S. Adds Two Natural Gas Rigs, While Oil Count Flat, Says BHI

2979 2018-07-14 16:57:43 You can eat curdrice and pickle manage to be champion in cricket, but definitely can not in football. Only oil and spice less beef eaters can get the stamina and energy to run on an average 6 to 8 KM per match.
2980 2018-07-14 16:57:29 Buying work shirts, getting an oil change and making a stop by the bank. It is a very adult Saturday
2981 2018-07-14 16:57:18 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, the same oil and with the same heat conditions, but they don't pop at the same time, your time Isn't my time, 
but we'll all pop!!
2982 2018-07-14 16:57:12 I usually keep a small bottle of lavender essential oil or peppermint oil and it helps me calm down a lot (the scent) & if you’re a tea drinker, chamomile tea is good to drink twice a day as well to help reduce it.
2983 2018-07-14 16:57:03 Coloretto is really hard to explain for new people. The actions are simple, but the scoring is really hard, especially for new, non-gamers. 

Snake Oil requires a lot of improvisation to be good and that isn't my brother or his group.
2984 2018-07-14 16:56:56 Over the last few years I have become a huge fan of @gpford. Never any annoying/ expensive service upsells, good mechanics doing the work, and their prices seem to be right in line with the other major national oil/garage chains.
2985 2018-07-14 16:56:54 She told me to avoid it. I have paracetamol and cbd oil and it’s taking the edge of it. Fecking teeth!
2986 2018-07-14 16:56:53 Ih olip oil lupain aku? >:O
2987 2018-07-14 16:56:45 Ohhhhhhh that was cold you oil merchants
2988 2018-07-14 16:56:39 Aloe vera and glycolic acid. Tried tea tree oil but burnt my face and i am allergic to most oils
2989 2018-07-14 16:56:34 Good to know...I cook with avocados, avocado oil, and avocado mayo a lot. If you're ever hanging here; it's important that I don't kill my lil' Viking sis.
2990 2018-07-14 16:56:31 You misunderstand the Ukraine situation.
And apparently the Canadian one - we rely on one oil & gas customer and have few means of changing that.  
Few options for Germany as well.
Harper pushed for a pipeline to tidewater but ultimately - the companies didn't want to invest.
2991 2018-07-14 16:56:14 No one reported unaccompanied minors were being locked up or people would’ve spoken out, but not same as ripping families apart & losing track. Oil companies know climate change is real. They’ve been paying to hide it for decades. You can be as nasty as you want, it’s still true.
2992 2018-07-14 16:56:13 Yo Moroccan oil has really been doing wonders for my hair
2993 2018-07-14 16:56:08 Looks like a thyroid surgery scar, because I have one, too. Badge of honor b/c that scar means we're still here. Mine is 10 yrs old. If you want to help the fade, use cocoa butter and vitamin E oil.
2994 2018-07-14 16:56:01 .. Police investigation work complete..  our contractors have been working over the last hour treating road surface oil spillages. With recovery work progressing well, we're hopeful of getting the carriageway open soon.
2995 2018-07-14 16:55:57 What’s a good treatment to use on your natural hair under a sew in.?my hair be itching like crazy,this coconut oil not cutting it
2996 2018-07-14 16:55:51 How is that I every time I change oil and fluid in a tractor, I always get covered in oil, no matter how clean or precautions I take.
2997 2018-07-14 16:55:28 I'm not allergic but I have a friend who's allergic to coconut oil and it's in everything.
2998 2018-07-14 16:55:21 Let me guess: "big oil libel"
2999 2018-07-14 16:55:02 Going to get this oil change done, then poker tournaments all day :)
3000 2018-07-14 16:54:59 I been up since 8am , got a oil change , washed my car and ran errands  TIRED

3004 2018-07-14 16:54:05 Chop ten teaspoons of olive oil and bring to a boil.

-expelled Ru diplomats
-forced RT to register under FARA
-kept troops on RU border
-sold weapons to anti-Ru Ukraine
3008 2018-07-14 16:53:33 Never go to an instant oil change place. They will try and take advantage of you!!!
3009 2018-07-14 16:53:33 The only reason I go to the dodge to get my oil changed is to keep from anything happening to my engine but $60 without tire rotation 
3010 2018-07-14 16:53:28 Day 1, put on middle shelf in front (otherwise it gets lost). Day 2, resist urge to move it behind something else. Day 3, saute garlic slices in olive oil, toss it in, eat. Lol.

3012 2018-07-14 16:53:25 Maybe Coloretto and Snake oil?
3013 2018-07-14 16:53:24 Woke up and got a oil change
3014 2018-07-14 16:53:09 早く刑を受けな。
3015 2018-07-14 16:53:06 True  I use Castile soap ... just offered an alternative. I know a lot of people use “Oil free” facial wash.
3016 2018-07-14 16:53:02 They just tried too finesse me out my car wash after my oil change.
3017 2018-07-14 16:52:59 Oh you don’t know?
Having trade wars with such giant powers also affects our economy. Where else do we buy stuffs if not from China and Eu and Canada where most of our folks go to school. 
Pulling out of Iran deal leads to another imbalance in the region which affects oil price

3019 2018-07-14 16:52:57 Reduce your stress! Dab essential oil (like lavender) onto your pulse points (wrists and behind your ears) to help you stay calm
3020 2018-07-14 16:52:54 We are not calling for revolution, we want the basics. We produce 80% of Iraqi oil, why the hell can't the government provide us the basics to survive. Shame, Shame. We will no longer take it.
3021 2018-07-14 16:52:51 Friend from highschool told me my Instagram posts are like 'puddle of oil with a shoe lace in it'
3022 2018-07-14 16:52:37 あっそっかぁ…(投獄)
3023 2018-07-14 16:52:32 Looks like snake oil to me. 
3024 2018-07-14 16:52:25 Peppermint oil is a good moisturizer
3025 2018-07-14 16:52:00 bagus dongggg, sangat recommended buat muka oil, aku aja dah mau habis sebotol ehehe
3026 2018-07-14 16:51:59 So why make a cannabis patient walk further for pain relief than buy a cheap bottle of a block away wine? Ancestors #cannascience not looking better than burnt toast or french fry oil vaping away in the 21st century? #GrowYourOwnTherapy
3027 2018-07-14 16:51:40 Climate change is a pain. What with all that coal and oil burning and rolling back of vehicle emissions laws. But you know that already
3028 2018-07-14 16:51:39 One day I was in the kitchen I knew what ingredients make ppl hair grow so there I conducted my own all natural hair care products line such as olive oil& peppermint oil for oil sheen....#lilcookquotes
3029 2018-07-14 16:51:20 @BeautyintheBag my top 3 warm weather concerns include Enlargement of pores, skin becoming an oil slick from the heat , and clogged pores from sweating 
3030 2018-07-14 16:51:07 If Elon Musk promises to start a Giga Factory in India in this visit, I will vote for BJP in 2019.
This move will hugly reduce oil imports from Middle East
3031 2018-07-14 16:51:03 Welcome!

You're right, I totally do miss the point.

If it's against the pipeline, why protest the lowest carbon footprint transport method?

Tankers: why only outgoing tankers?

All oil: why only in Canada? Why not protest things like pavement, computers and warm houses?
3032 2018-07-14 16:50:57 He has more similar credits:
1. Achieved lowest GDP.
2. Only P.M to visit more countries, highest expenditure with NIL outcome.
3. Relationship with neighbouring countries drifting to its lowest.
4.Lowest Cruda Oil price, Highest revenue earning from Petrol & Diesel for no good.

3034 2018-07-14 16:50:43 It's a weird feeling. I always seem to feel it down my arms too, I'd describe it like having hot oil running through my veins.
3035 2018-07-14 16:50:31 統計力学、頭の中で体系的にまとまってない
3036 2018-07-14 16:50:19 Argan oil. Which sucks because it's so amazing for my hair but breaks my face out in cystic pimples on the hairline if I use it
3037 2018-07-14 16:50:03 HA! And this is why my dad changes the oil in ALL the vehicles at this house!
3038 2018-07-14 16:49:58 @Walmart put the wrong oil in my car, if my car fucks up YOU BUYING ME A NEW ONE 
3039 2018-07-14 16:49:58 ok well i need an oil change, so get to it
3040 2018-07-14 16:49:54 The man changing my oil just dragged me to hell, but I’ll let him live.
3041 2018-07-14 16:49:48 I like oil and booty

3043 2018-07-14 16:49:32 Been so good to my hair , coconut oil and rice water combo 
3044 2018-07-14 16:49:29 If you do use “Oil free” products, right after you wash your face use a toner to rebalance the PH levels and it should help moisturizer your skin! Witch hazel makes a great toner! #ThingsMyRoommateTaughtMe
3045 2018-07-14 16:49:28 most business leaders do thin. It is how the game is played. If you want a different result, change the game. Fact is he is NOT a climate change denier and he is disrupting and forever changing the oil and gas and auto industries among others and THAT is why I support him
3046 2018-07-14 16:49:26 5555555555555555
3047 2018-07-14 16:49:21 Should we assume that Theo hasn't read the Kinder-Morgan decision yet? Pipelines move oil and gas to market there right winger! Call the action in front of you and tell him Roger!
3048 2018-07-14 16:49:20 Did Obama call your home huts and all. Is Obama a racist like Trump? Obama sent soldiers to help fight Bokoharam. Obama did what he did to Nigeria because he believed that we needed a change at that time. What’s the point of having an oil deal with criminals in charge?
3049 2018-07-14 16:49:20 Foden won't get a chance with pep throwing even more oil money at city. If only Southgate played Alli in his best position instead of dropping him deeper for sterling. And the walker CB experiment failed once opposition moved up

Multiculturalism is wonderful for a country, yes, but not "Government sponsored multiculturalism" ! We went from a beautiful bilingual country to a disastrous moziac, where the (loudest minority) squeaky wheel gets the oil.

3054 2018-07-14 16:49:05 Having so much oil in ground is not matter of good business but matter of being good friend with Alah / Jezus who decide to put your country on back see.
3055 2018-07-14 16:48:39 Does this mean the Canadian government will be recycling all of those thousands of empty oil drums that have been littering the north for decades and sealskin coats will become a popular way of keeping warm again?
3056 2018-07-14 16:48:35 Oil and gas keep this nation alive and strong. Seems shortsighted to be angry with them for serving the public
3057 2018-07-14 16:48:30 It works for me tbh. My skin is so oily I cannot use something that’s not oil free

3072 2018-07-14 16:46:19 2 years ago I had my thyroid removed & it left a long, very red scar. I used a product called Bio Oil, you can get it at the drug store, I used it twice a day, it faded & healed the scar. Mine is barely noticeable now. And you're right ppl do stare, such buggers.
3073 2018-07-14 16:46:12 Likely one of the worst jobs I've ever had. Still have scars all over my left wrist from oil burns from that place.

3086 2018-07-14 16:45:00 Why are they so bad? I use rapid clear, oil free cleanser and the stress control toner. Do you have suggestions for things to use instead? (I have cystic acne so I like the benzoyl peroxide in the rapid clear)
3087 2018-07-14 16:44:44 Ok. I said that because on my '97 Daytona I had some spots on a fork's tube. It damaged the oil seal.. I changed it by myself with help of the workshop's book.

3109 2018-07-14 16:40:49 My @Hyundai  Sonata dies while accelerating, little did I know, there was no oil! The oil warning light NEVER came on! NO engine noise, nothing. @Hyundai issued an extended warranty for this known problem but because I'm a few thousand miles over the limit, I'm screwed!
3110 2018-07-14 16:40:43 "Fake news" just slides off your tongue like oil. All news even Fox came to the defense of Acosta. Cmon, we'd all have an ounce of respect if you just admitted that everything you do is for Putin.
3111 2018-07-14 16:40:41 Yes indeed. Restoration forces attack Victoria (Limbe) now the 2nd time. Its a touristic place on the seaside and centre of crude oil transformation. The place was for long a safe heaven. Many francophones are there because of the refinery.

3124 2018-07-14 16:38:44 So many reasons but for a start Obama showed Nigeria no regard. He started boycotting our oil, openly meddled in our elections in 2015 in favour of buhari, supported the Arab Spring that helped Boko Haram explode then refused to sell us weapons etc His impact was negative on us
3125 2018-07-14 16:38:33 What about all the work that has been taking place to make Alberta as a leader through AB innovates? Did you go to Innventures?The collaboration with the Rainforest? It’s a great time to be here and at this pace we will be known not just for oil and gas! Aren’t you excited?
3126 2018-07-14 16:38:27 that’s cause dodges literally come off the truck with no oil and shit like that. they don’t care they slap garbage on the truck and send it off.

3134 2018-07-14 16:36:51 Fossil fuels are produced by conglomerates — to rely on them is to rely on the corporation producing them (unless you’ve struck oil in your own backyard and have means to refine it yourself). And so relying on them is tricking oneself into being a slave to those conglomerates.

3193 2018-07-14 16:30:17 Exactly. Putin is no dummy, now that the Deep State is not reigning he would use it to make a deal regarding sanctions, oil, or whatever. If he plays nice instead of thuggish Russia could prosper. But he needs to quit helping Iran.
3194 2018-07-14 16:30:16 Have you ever put coconut oil on your hair before bleaching? I did that with my daughters and it doesn’t even feel bleached.
3195 2018-07-14 16:30:16 Yah,
Bailed out Big Banks already have it. Subsidized Big OIL already has it. etc. etc.
Now...let the rest of us in on the money train!

3197 2018-07-14 16:30:03 @ToughThurTrivia Hey Jake, the mcdonalds fries recipe you have on mashed, I'm having problems with it, not sure if I followed the directions right or missed something. I did everything until I got to the three oils: corn oil, soybean oil, and canola oil, I mixed them all in fryer

3204 2018-07-14 16:29:39 But they have no oil and no billionaires to pay bribes so Trump's attention is elsewhere.

3213 2018-07-14 16:28:34 If a “Guru’s” main selling point is the toys he’s “bought” with the money he’s “made online”

Understand you aren’t buying from a Guru anymore

You are buying from a Snake Oil Salesman
3214 2018-07-14 16:28:24 If Trump is in cahoots with Russia, why would he give Poland missiles and take Germany to task for paying billions to Russia for oil?  Those aren’t the actions of someone trying to help Russia.
3215 2018-07-14 16:28:22 We've been updated that your supply is affected due to oil leakage and the expected time of supply restoration is 10.30 p.m. Appreciate your patience in the meantime.

3227 2018-07-14 16:26:23 Sad that as we have bought into the idea that water from their tap is unsafe, our response has been to pay 500x the price for mostly the same water -- after it has passed through reverse osmosis or distillation (at a massive energy cost) and repackaged in bottles made of  oil.

3234 2018-07-14 16:25:24 Dude not oil, gas as in Nordstream 2.  And Russia has been supplying gas and oil to Europe since the mid 20th century.

3245 2018-07-14 16:24:22 @SupremCourtpk Crude Oil Import: Oil is imported under the agreements made by Pakistan Govt., usually through PSO with the Oil Exporting Companies. Import price is based on the Spot price of oil at that time. Agreement is for 3,6 or 12 months. Price remains same for whole period.
3246 2018-07-14 16:24:21 What, what, what has he done for us?  Allowing poison to be sprayed on our food?  Allowing coal ash in our waterways?  Taking public land, beautiful land that could be enjoyed by our children and grandchildren, and giving it to miners and oil companies?
3247 2018-07-14 16:24:18 The same Russians that you want to make a deal with for the same oil?

Well, good bye @zweifelchips then, i really enjoyed your chips, but i will now purchase @TyrrellsChips instead!


3250 2018-07-14 16:23:42 It's all about the profit Trump will have with Putin's oil deal, schmucks.

Padahal kan  sunflower seed oil sangat dibutuhkan ole wajah semua org:)(
3252 2018-07-14 16:23:23 I'm sorry but they *are* evidenced-based. It's that most people misinterpret the evidence...Low fat means fruit, vegetables, whole foods, minimally processed grains, less oil. But people interpret it as low fat cookies, white bread, low fat fast food, etc.
3253 2018-07-14 16:23:22 is it safe to put coconut oil on my eyelashes

3258 2018-07-14 16:23:07 That’s great but they have entered oil deal with Russia and have basically gone behind the West’s back. Afghanistan has nothing to do with that lol. Good reach though.

3261 2018-07-14 16:22:50 Serena was a tad off and likely ran out of steam but huge kudos to Kerber who was in top form. Only other woman who can say they beat Serena in two Grand Slam Finals is Venus. Impressive. #Wimbledon
3262 2018-07-14 16:22:43 I guess I’ll go get a oil change and do my emissions 
3263 2018-07-14 16:22:34 Big ups to the old dudes at Revere Beach who post up for the day in the middle of the sidewalk. With 1980s tri-fold chairs and all the oil.
3264 2018-07-14 16:22:25 Bummer! I have not had great luck with coconut oil in baked goods either.
3265 2018-07-14 16:22:19 1) this is not socialism, 2) it doesn't seem as a commercial win to me. It's just extracting and selling oil. Not undermining that at all, but it's by no means a true business model. This is like saying Saudi Arabia is more advanced than Singapore. It's apples to oranges.

3295 2018-07-14 16:19:49 @smerconish, @potus is confronting Russians like no one before. He is killing them in Syria, arming Ukraine, reducing oil prices, stopping Germany's dependence on them, increasing US and NATO military spending. Contrast this with @POTUS44 and @HillaryClinton who were colluding.

2. Stir well, then apply to your face for 15-20 minuets 

3. Rinse with lukewarm water and then moisturize

3333 2018-07-14 16:16:14 Hey, we should import more oil from that regime and use less of that bad Canadian oil.
3334 2018-07-14 16:16:01 Relief sculptures completed and done 3 days before deadline. Yes, I was burning the midnight oil for the last 4 days. #artists #Deadline #proud #exhausted
3335 2018-07-14 16:15:59 U DIRTY OIL SAUSAGE FEST FREAK.
3336 2018-07-14 16:15:56 เพื่อนไม่เต้น เข่าไม่ดี ไปร้านนั่งก็ได้ 5555555
3337 2018-07-14 16:15:54 Oil de your head. 

I love when football fans put local rivalry aside and appreciate ballers in rival clubs. Saw a poll earlier... Modric vs Pogba and it was close. Broke my heart.
3338 2018-07-14 16:15:40 My family has a background in the oil industry and due to their attitudes I am deeply resentful of it. I really want to get out of an oil-burner ASAP, if only to rub their faces in it. (Yes, I have a very healthy relationship with my family obviously.)
3339 2018-07-14 16:15:31 Stopped at a gas station and decided to check my oil (since I haven’t for a while)... guy pulls up 3 pumps over and yells, “I tell you what! You are the FIRST woman I’ve ever seen checking her own oil!”

3340 2018-07-14 16:15:30 Never mix Oil and Blood #Law
3341 2018-07-14 16:15:27 Those are good but try olive oil too
3342 2018-07-14 16:15:21 I religiously take my makeup off with coconut oil!
3343 2018-07-14 16:15:13 20 day correlation for S&P 500 vs. Crude Oil sits at 0.208 … nice as the S&P is up 0.53% & Crude Oil is up 6.41%
3344 2018-07-14 16:15:08 Uncle Joe, My head is ready for the #Oil ooooo.
3345 2018-07-14 16:15:06 @SIRIUSXM please play “Pour Your Oil “ by @thejoshuarogers the song is  #newmusic #music @kirkfranklin @patmckaymusic @MetaWashington #gospel @MixedBagEnt
3346 2018-07-14 16:15:03 Lamp oil! RAPE! Bombs! You want it?
3347 2018-07-14 16:15:01 What about Turkana oil?
3348 2018-07-13 23:59:58 They didn't even make Whip It queer! Roller derby is the queerest of sports! (With the possible exception of Turkish oil wrestling.)
3349 2018-07-13 23:59:55 I can dialyze the oil out of poisonous stuff, but it will not improve the outlook
3350 2018-07-13 23:59:39 Dry body oil (decided on no shimmer cuz I hate glitter), lip scrub and the lavender mask . This list will probably get longer by the time I get paid though lol
3351 2018-07-13 23:59:31 Trump spent years saying everything President Obama did was wrong.  Yet, before he makes a move, he checks to see if PBO did it first just to provide cover for himself.  He wants to release some oil reserves because he knows PBO did it too.
3352 2018-07-13 23:59:31 put that money into building a few new refineries in Alberta and refine that oil here to lower our fuel costs instead.
3353 2018-07-13 23:58:58 "Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles!"
3354 2018-07-13 23:58:55 Imagine if the emails that were exposed contained messages of how you guys wanted to pass national healthcare & end fossil fuels & not steal Libyan oil & quit supporting charter schools & ending mass incarceration & prosecuting white collar criminals, etc.. 

You’d have won 2016
3355 2018-07-13 23:58:25 I see where Trump has eased restrictions on oil, coal and nat gas.
Cheap energy in the third world will light that candle. 

But there is no doubt that CO2 levels are on the rise. 
Climatologists have lost credibility on temperature data d/t manipulation.

 
Any predictions?
3356 2018-07-13 23:58:24 OK. Kill the birds and they look ugly. Same thing as oil platform. I take oil platform any day.
3357 2018-07-13 23:58:16 Fresh oil change & tune up my wheel bout to float 
3358 2018-07-13 23:58:08 I bought body oil cause it was more time and cost efficient than finding a boy to fuck or getting sex lube.
3359 2018-07-13 23:57:58 Enjoy it while we can. Zinke will be putting an oil drilling field on it soon.
3360 2018-07-13 23:57:31 Hay solución al ajuste salvaje. Q devuelva Andreíta los 34 palos. El Kichi los3000 millones de YPF. Lopez lo 9 millones y el otro López los 9000 millones de OIL. Listo somos Noruega!!!!

3362 2018-07-13 23:56:46 People don't get it, they can talk about the PopularVote all that but I can tell u EXACTLY when HillaryC lost theRustBeltStates It was in WV on #CNN when the she sat across from a group of CoalMiners an the SmugBitch said she was ending Coal an OIL was in trouble too. #Moron
3363 2018-07-13 23:56:40 Looks great, who are you leasing it to for oil drilling and/or fracking?
3364 2018-07-13 23:56:29 I've been using Cremo beard oil or Beardbrand's utility balm depending on the day. And Shea Moisture beard wash every couple days
3365 2018-07-13 23:56:28 Same with Weiner
3366 2018-07-13 23:56:26 I think there main point is to just provide jobs, whatever they might be and that the oil revenues shouldn't go in the pockets of corrupt politicians.

3387 2018-07-13 23:56:07 Went to spend 39.99 on an oil change and ended up spending 103.87 ain’t this a bitch!!!
3388 2018-07-13 23:56:06 He has sent me to bind up the brocken hearted, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of dispair. 

ISIAH 61:2-3
3389 2018-07-13 23:55:53 Luckily Trump is pushing for more coal and oil instead of renewable energy
3390 2018-07-13 23:55:23 baby oil 
3391 2018-07-13 23:55:15 Awesome job #nevergiveup
3392 2018-07-13 23:55:14 Jeff are you a federal prosecutor?  What is your expertise on this exactly? what we have seen so far from Mueller is likely just the tip of the iceberg. That should frighten you. If you want to stick with supporting a draft dodging lying philandering snake oil salesman do so.
3393 2018-07-13 23:55:12 Did they oil up and wrestle after the show?
3394 2018-07-13 23:54:42 That’s awesome - is that oil?
3395 2018-07-13 23:54:32 Not too mention taking Iraq out of it. Which is hard to do because we are still there and not just for oil. By killing terrorists we are protesting what they stand for. Only with guns and bombs instead of signs and a voice.
3396 2018-07-13 23:54:26 She'd try to run away and leaves the library.
3397 2018-07-13 23:54:20 Kakatapos ko lang gamitin. Maganda siya! Ganda ng feeling sa mukha. Una yung oil cleanser then yung foam. After ng foam wash dapat may toner ka. 

#dafBAMA2018Nadine
3398 2018-07-13 23:54:11 Lmaoooo nah but, ever since I cut off pizza from what I normally eat, it’s helped a lot. I use black soap everytime I shower plus my doctor prescribed me this thing called benzoyl peroxide foam that helps with excess oil. Drinking water will prob help this process too but I slack
3399 2018-07-13 23:54:11 Not if Trump has something to do with it. 
I hear they're getting whale oil lamps installed as well. 
To the future past!
3400 2018-07-13 23:54:08 When looking like a tomato coconut oil is my best friend.
3401 2018-07-13 23:53:59 WA State Attorney General Bob Ferguson has betrayed Yakima Indigenous people, by appealing Cougar Den, Inc. oil case to Supreme Court, after WA State Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in favor of the Yakima. Ferguson is great on immigration, but this is outrageous.
3402 2018-07-13 23:53:43 A McDonald's fry-o-later with oil last changed in April 2015.
3403 2018-07-13 23:53:40 Great job.
3404 2018-07-13 23:53:35 Two kids in their late teens came into my store today, looked at the Rosemary olive oil and asked each other in genuine puzzlement if rosemary was a kind of fruit. I can't make this stuff up.
3405 2018-07-13 23:53:28 @SenGillibrand Reject GOP efforts 2 destroy ESA>guts science/judicial review, tilts crucial mgmt decisions 2 politicians w/ oil, gas, mining agenda>this would be the "beginning of the end" 4 apex predators, wildlife, ecosystems, ecotourism, & forests #StopExtinction
3406 2018-07-13 23:53:23 “oil or cream or whatever” - the main character on the foreign substance that is lube
3407 2018-07-13 23:53:18 This infuriates me to no end. I lived in PR. Graduated HS in Bayamon. My Dad was a manager of Yabucoa Sun Oil Co. This was my home & it & it's incredibly wonderful, kind, hardworking people are being treated like an afterthought. Enough already!
3408 2018-07-13 23:53:09 Amazing, isn’t it.
3409 2018-07-13 23:53:05 theres lard in my potato chips......LARD....they couldnt have just used regular oil im
3410 2018-07-13 23:52:57 Aku jg cleansing oilnya jg pake baby oil nah pas dikasih mois itu jadi perih gituu gara gara pada ngeluapas kulitnya huhu:(
3411 2018-07-13 23:52:54 P.S. The arctic has always been subject to wild temperature swings over short periods. In the year 1300, Greenland summer temps were about 6 degrees higher than today's; in 1500, they were about 6 degrees lower.

Climate change is inevitable and natural, oil or no oil.
3412 2018-07-13 23:52:50 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3413 2018-07-13 23:52:33 What are you angry about. Trump making nato strong by collecting more money to strengthen it. Trump calling out Germany for funding Putin by buy oil and gas from Putin or The economy or talks of peace on Korean Peninsula. Trumps doing more in 2 yrs what Barack did in 8....
3414 2018-07-13 23:52:27 "Like so!"

She'd kick one of her heels into the other's chest.

"I said unhand me!"
3415 2018-07-13 23:52:18 So what you are saying is that I just need to convince @MaddyOreillyxxx and sign up for a Costco membership for the pallet of oil 
3416 2018-07-13 23:52:17 What should we do to hold Russia accountable: 
Build up our military?
Build up NATO?
Shoot Cruise missiles into Syria?
Tell the Germans to cut off oil revenue?
Financial sanctions?
Yeah, doing those already...
Are the Democrats asking for war? Really?
3417 2018-07-13 23:52:17 No collusion it’s not a crime but conspiracy is a crime. When the orange fool stood at that podium and said on tv “Russia if u are listening”? I could not believe the media didn’t hold him accountable. #DonTheCon the snake oil salesman.
3418 2018-07-13 23:52:08 They dont even have to pay my gas, just cover my oil changes that I'm too lazy to do myself cuz I live in an apartment (excuse no. 1)!
3419 2018-07-13 23:52:07 No but seriously. My mind was thinking about the rosehip oil i ordered online and singing the same song all night.
3420 2018-07-13 23:52:04 Oil and Gas Production is 1.63 million boe/day, the highest of any EU country,there is no need for discussion on whether Scotland can afford it !
3421 2018-07-13 23:51:59 Once again, Trump gets all the facts more messed up than that dead beaver on his head. Check out oil imports/exports during Obama years; Facts are facts.
3422 2018-07-13 23:51:58 Pizza oil and gravy works wonders
3423 2018-07-13 23:51:35 I still cant get over Trump criticizing germany, all because of a bill passed due to russia hysteria he now has to enforce, for something that if he did they would have started rioting for perceived russian collusion over oil was played in the press as pro putin
3424 2018-07-13 23:51:33 Tangan langsung, Dear. :)

Baik milk cleanser dan cleansing oil langsung pakai tangan karena nanti kita akan pijat wajah dengan gerakan circular motion.
3425 2018-07-13 23:51:32 Well Well Well! The Slime And Filth Doth Leak From Pence's Oil Closet! 
3426 2018-07-13 23:51:27 Well, @Digbylj actually claims that no one in Scotland pays taxes, that the UK collects no oil and gas or corporate taxes in Scotland, and no VAT, Nation Insurance, inheritance tax, or capitol gains in Scotland. But other than that it is totally 100% correct. 
3427 2018-07-13 23:51:05 @Jamestown502 Can you help me find some cannabis oil or something to help my mother's knees? She needs 2 knee replacements but we're unable to get it right now. She's in a lot of pain and can barely walk.
3428 2018-07-13 23:51:00 I haven’t tried the primer but do the same with rosehip seed oil. I’ll be sure to try both!
3429 2018-07-13 23:50:55 @kearth101 I will agree @McDonalds frys are the best because of the double frying. Followed by @redrobinburgers yummm, and #Tops in Pasadena. In n Outs are disgusting for us, the oil tastes nasty is frys dont get eaten within 3 min.
3430 2018-07-13 23:50:54 Minyak kelapa atau olive oil bisa kok
3431 2018-07-13 23:50:52 Hit the studio on drugs when you get all in your feelings
Look into your eyes homie, you ain't ever lived it
But always talking cooking dope, man ever had heart ache
Ever lost money learned how to cook oil based
3432 2018-07-13 23:50:50 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
3433 2018-07-13 23:50:38 Love my coconut oil @Momof4plus2dogs
3434 2018-07-13 23:50:37 "...Fine.

3437 2018-07-13 23:50:20 You can use unscented moisturizers in shaving creams or even lotions and even olive oil (ik you feel like it’s gross) but either one works. The one that I use is a Cetaphil lotion and You put it all over your body like you do daily then you go in the shower, shave, and wash off.
3438 2018-07-13 23:50:19 Gotta wait for the Fate oil rig to run dry before tsukihime hd :(
3439 2018-07-13 23:50:17 Thank you Emmy! Love coconut oil!
3440 2018-07-13 23:50:13 facial oil tu macam mana eh?
3441 2018-07-13 23:50:07 Dua-duanya sama bagusnya kok untuk bersihkan wajah. Tapi untuk olive oil aku lebih menyarankan pakai extra virgin coconut oil.
3442 2018-07-13 23:49:46 How do you become an oil on liveraise could you tell me please

Wow...ruDE
3449 2018-07-13 23:48:41 We took Iraq for Oil... and they’re allow d to protest... I’m also allowed to laugh at their fake outrage. Life is a Dance and right now the Left all across the world has two left feet.
3450 2018-07-13 23:48:37 That smell of gun oil
3451 2018-07-13 23:48:33 I love that sermon: “Frozen oil and chosen vessels” it meant so much listening to it. It came in the perfect time...God answered my prayers through it.  Thanks pastor @stevenfurtick! God bless you, your family and your ministry.

3458 2018-07-13 23:47:08 @SenBooker Reject reckless GOP attacks on the ESA.>Guts protections 4 most imperiled species, cripples science, judicial review>tilts power from experts to politicians w/ an oil, gas, mining agenda. This would b the beginning of the end 4 wildlife, ecosystems, ecotourism, forests
3459 2018-07-13 23:47:07 I tried dryer balls and got holes in all my knits. These homemade dryer sheets are re-usable because they're just rags soaked in white vinegar and some essential oil that I also made (almond oil + lilacs). And they worked!
3460 2018-07-13 23:47:03 Do you remember the time you bailed out of the jeep you were driving in Battlefield without warning me and sent me flying into the oil tanker that promptly blew up? CUZ I FUCKING DO.
3461 2018-07-13 23:46:54 Free oil change and tire rotation with a paid round of golf?
3462 2018-07-13 23:46:50 That smile though!

3471 2018-07-13 23:45:54 The fact that he had any interest is surprising too. Comes across more as the whiny guy in the corner rating all the other guys’ clothing.
3472 2018-07-13 23:45:47 I SWEAR BY bio oil !!! It takes time to see results but hunny it don’t leave a single trace of a dark spot
3473 2018-07-13 23:45:37 Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, warming the climate about 80-times more than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. Oil and gas operations are the largest single industrial source of methane emissions in the U.S.
BUT KEEP BLAMING THE COWS!!!
3474 2018-07-13 23:45:33 I got an oil change and dude was like I’m surprised  you went 20k miles without an oil change !

3481 2018-07-13 23:44:47 Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!
3482 2018-07-13 23:44:47 Buy me beard oil for my birthday.
3483 2018-07-13 23:44:40 We should sell oil from the reserve when the price is high and buy when the price is low.  It will smooth the price and make a profit.  I will leave to professional economists what the buy/sell price points should be.
3484 2018-07-13 23:44:36 The USA pays over $3 TRILLION in health care costs.  A plant based, whole food diet (no meat, no dairy, no oil) REVERSES heart disease and other chronic conditions.  The ONLY way to 'health' care is to care about health.  #vegan
3485 2018-07-13 23:44:35 I tried that and it did not work  my nails just have a hard time growing in general. I’ve tried every vitamin and oil treatment you can think of. I think all the biotin goes to my hair lol bc it grows like a weed!!!
3486 2018-07-13 23:44:28 I put vinegar and a few drops of essential oil in a spray bottle and let them dry overnight and it helped a lot!

3492 2018-07-13 23:43:31 "Yeah. Is the oil helping?"
3493 2018-07-13 23:43:31 I WAS IN THE KITCHEN BRALESS COOKING AN EGG AND AS I FLIPPED THE EGG THE HOT OIL SPLASHES ON ME SEEPS THRU MY SHIRT AND BURNS MY FCKIN NIPPLE I HATE FRIDAY THE 13TH

GL A RE
3496 2018-07-13 23:42:45 Yep, she fixed flats and did oil changes.  Truly rolling up the royal sleeves.  She also still cares for her Corgis too who follow her around.  Dogs know.
3497 2018-07-13 23:42:37 Trump claimed at presser today that US would not have become an oil exporter under “previous regimes” that it took Trump to make it so #mepolitics The ignorance is astounding - US has been a net oil exporter for years
3498 2018-07-13 23:42:22 ...and "giveaways" meaning not taking as much from them
3499 2018-07-13 23:42:21 On today's episode of Jamaica is not a real place.Two man a cuss and one say "Yuh go a foreign go mek man oil dem finger and pluck yuh."  Now mi know why mi nuh look come outta mi house.
3500 2018-07-13 23:42:14 Oil for ever!
3501 2018-07-13 23:42:12 Icing my knees. Cleaning up broken oil bottles, glass and oil everywhere really made my knees hurt. Most likely all of the slipping and sliding.
3502 2018-07-13 23:42:02 And some cbd oil bath bombs!!!
3503 2018-07-13 23:41:59 Hmm the goodness of America, bombing & killing innocent people for oil and toppling governments for their own political purpose.
3504 2018-07-13 23:41:34 Read a book coal and oil industry. Fossil fuels are changing the atmosphere right now.  This will impact the fucking planet including the kids and grandkids of the people whose guilt stories you’re trying to shove down my throat.
3505 2018-07-13 23:41:22 Lol. Until you sleep for GUnit, i never accomplish my mission
3506 2018-07-13 23:41:04 Great idea. *opening the door leading outside*
3507 2018-07-13 23:41:01 My narrative is simple Eat Real Food. New foods that man invented (see Veg Oil) probably causes a lot of the diseases of civilization.
3508 2018-07-13 23:40:54 Did he just not tell Germany not to buy oil or gas from that pipe line ? That will hurt Russia way more than not talking to them .
3509 2018-07-13 23:40:52 I’ll never forget when Ford forgot to put oil in my car during an oil change. 
3510 2018-07-13 23:40:39 Maybe big oil should frack in Avon Ohio! Maybe you’ll be more concerned!
3511 2018-07-13 23:40:35 No one called him a mastermind? Except for the people saying he colluded with the Russian Government and was a spy since the 80's. The sanctions HE put into place... advocating for others to not buy Russian oil... pushing others to BOOST NATO spending... clearly Russian interests
3512 2018-07-13 23:40:32 Today’s Recap: woke up hung over ate a slice of pizza drank ovaltine, left truck at dealerships for a oil change, walked 1 mile to a bar, drank beer and mocked drafts for fantasy  trying to life that @bertkreischer life #fantasylife
3513 2018-07-13 23:40:28 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
3514 2018-07-13 23:40:22 My niece took my Tahoe in for the oil change at the Hartselle Alabama Walmart and they did not put enough oil in it to start with and did not tighten the oil filter. Thus 3 quarts low in two weeks
3515 2018-07-13 23:40:22 Run a better candidate.    Loss had nothing to do with Russians.     Start supporting union miners and union members in the oil industry instead of trying to kill the companies that employ them.
3516 2018-07-13 23:40:20 Here in latin america NRA will ensure we open the boarders to arm latin america to create the new middle east carnage and steal their oil...
3517 2018-07-13 23:40:14 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

3521 2018-07-13 23:39:39 Can’t tell which bottle of canola oil came from ugly fields tho...
3522 2018-07-13 23:39:32 What are you talking about? The loss of indigenous energy potential is down to the fact that our oil and gas deposits are running out. It has bugger all to do with the EU. We are a net importer of energy, and it is only going to get worse if we don’t develop renewables.
3523 2018-07-13 23:39:15 They were going because of a pipeline. Ron Johnson just loves Russia. Look at the proposed keystone pipeline expansion. The only states it goes through are all the states of those senators. It's about oil/gas money.
3524 2018-07-13 23:39:15 You are truly blessed with an embarrassment of riches.

The problem for me is if it is ranked by distance, the order is reversed. Except for the cheese in a can, or "American cheese", which to me is not cheese, it is some sort of solid oil product not for for consumption.
3525 2018-07-13 23:39:11 I cant relate please.

Graduate of FUTO here. 
3526 2018-07-13 23:39:06 Lucas oil TV unavailable?
3527 2018-07-13 23:39:02 I am reasonably sure there exists better non-alcohol based methods of self-destuction, but Tesco can onlu provide so much legally.

If cannabis oil was legal there would be another effective route.

C'est la vie.

3546 2018-07-13 23:36:28 In fact, big oil companies had already figured out climate change might be an issue internally, but they kept the results secret because it obviously wouldn't help their bottom line if people knew about it.
3547 2018-07-13 23:36:21 Ill take a shot of the canola oil please.

She raised her hands.

"Look, calm down. It's fine. All you need to do, is not do it again!
I mean... I love giving people a boost to their devoting, selfish, /lovable/, lust, but taking me by surprise like that..

Isn't allowed!"

3554 2018-07-13 23:34:57 I’m well aware of projections . I’m in the industry. So is Teck who is proposing the largest oil sands project in history and Suncor who is expanding. You can believe what you read in articles. I’ll believe first hand information and actual investment dollars.  Think they know 1/
3555 2018-07-13 23:34:57 if they let you down while enjoying the wealth of rich Oil Kirkuk, why keeping moving with a deficient leadership..? Development of Iraq just like the development of  Iraqi Kurdish held region depend on the stabilization of the entire Middle East region,
3556 2018-07-13 23:34:55 I can understand but sad that vegan options still support animal products with customers $ or even the shop we buy from like a supermarket. I just won’t buy from parent companies that test on animals or products with palm oil or unethical
3557 2018-07-13 23:34:54 Wouldn’t have anything to do with the palm oil industry would it? 
3558 2018-07-13 23:34:49 Politicians are the people who failed the ethics tests when they applied to be snake oil salesmen.

3583 2018-07-13 23:31:40 The government tries to step in when there’s oil at stake, or our allies are being killed by Bombs or mass genocides. Like all those things that happen in the Middle East. The tricky thing is, some people want the U.S to help, and some don’t. So who do you listen to?

*Passes over two tickets to our local minor league baseball team*

Best. Oil. Change. Ever.
3593 2018-07-13 23:30:26 2/. that foreign denominated debt.  Oil prices crashed.  That was bad.  On top of that, unlike Norway, Ven didn’t use its oil revenue to diversify the economy, so there’s massive shortages of commodities.  Norway used its oil rev to diversify, w/many businesses being state owned
3594 2018-07-13 23:30:25 @JohnCornyn How deep are Texas roots in this?  Oil deep?
3595 2018-07-13 23:30:21 How about pouring a 4 quarts of FLEX SEAL in the crankcase when you have your next oil change?

3601 2018-07-13 23:29:58 Totally biased and fake! ADL and SPLC are the definition of hate pushers. Make a living off spreading hate, lies and divisions. American population is waking up to your lies. You're constantly being exposed as snake oil salesman!!

No more recommendations 4 ya
3609 2018-07-13 23:28:05 He would have wondered why it is that if fly spray kills flies then why does engine oil not taste fantastic on donuts. Your wonderings are wandering again. The pills... take the pills.
3610 2018-07-13 23:27:42 Venezuela’s on its arse because they got ganged up on by loads of other countries and the IMF,I mean they have the largest oil reserves in the world once being known as ‘Saudi Venezuela’.Then Saudi deliberately started flooding the market with oil so Venezuela’s lost its value

3612 2018-07-13 23:27:41 There are huge, privately owned, plantations & tons of privately owned businesses.  Simple fact.  Yes, Ven is in big trouble:  Unlike Norway, it is not a monetary sovereign.  It owes debts in foreign currency & over relies on oil revenues to pay...
3613 2018-07-13 23:27:29 I'd say try a vape instead with oil that has thc. It's much less bothersome then smoking

3618 2018-07-13 23:25:54 Germany is going to get oil from whoever sells it to them. If we sell it to them, they'll buy it from us. That simple.

3628 2018-07-13 23:23:40 Doing some research for an article led me to looking up data on tycoons from the Gilded Age, which invariably led to reading about John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. 

I knew before any research that Rockefeller was (almost certainly) the richest human ever, but whoa.
3629 2018-07-13 23:23:20 So I spilled a whole (small) bottle of coconut oil whilst attempting to do a hot oil hair treatment. It landed on my clothes and on my cellphone. 

It's safe to say, I'm probably not going to ever do this treatment again.

3637 2018-07-13 23:21:45 You probably will not answer but why does the oil money have to be distributed among all Libyans?  Look at the pittance which comes to either #Barqah or #Fezzan region. And has! And continues!  And being made clear no changes are to be from who gets the lion share now !

3647 2018-07-13 23:20:28 Sure, we'll see demand destruction balance the market out at some point, but that pain threshold is much higher than $70/barrel.

I'd love nothing better than $150 oil if just to encourage less fossil fuel usage.  Going to really miss skiing in a couple decades at this rate.

In the meantime why is the US fighting an economic war with Venezuela??

3681 2018-07-13 23:14:33 Agree on under-investment. But that points to another unspoken thing in the #oil mkt: demand response, which media/analysts don't bring up even to disparage it.

“The country officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande), and along with it came the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) which is the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company.”

3830 2018-07-13 22:56:58 i use coconut oil
3831 2018-07-13 22:56:49 I do prefer steak cut fries. I tend to like them a bit darker/crispier than that. I do potato wedges at home with olive oil and good sea salt that I quite like.
3832 2018-07-13 22:56:45 But you CAN actually ger fried like foods but that requires flour, sometimes oil, and corn starch. Too messy for me so I just opted for flourless wings.

3839 2018-07-13 22:55:49 Spills WILL happen. It’s stupid to argue speculation. Just as stupid as me saying spills will NEVER happen. Ridiculous comment. I told you previously, look at the stats. It’s very unlikely. Do you know how many oil tankers  are on the water every day?  Look it up - I have.

3867 2018-07-13 22:50:41 @realDonaldTrump To say, oil will be at this in 6 months when no one knows if it will or not or that a war or problems will disrupt the flow is stupid. Only thing that disrupts the flow is when countries try to stop output but we don't need other countries.Put us on our own oil

3887 2018-07-13 22:48:24 She thought she's already figured it out! And the first thing that came to her mind was...

"If you wanna look at perverted stuff, then do it in your bedroom.

Isn't that what you're looking at? Or am i wrong? Are you getting excited /in public/? How shameful!"
3888 2018-07-13 22:48:08 I had olive oil in from the beginning; when I flipped I added a bit of butter.
3889 2018-07-13 22:47:55 Senator, the only solution is to take control of both houses to the point where he can't unilateral. His policies overseas r designed incite violence & open the door to putin.  I still think the solution = sell Europe all gas & oil FOB Rotterdam below his extraction cost.
3890 2018-07-13 22:47:50 “Hey, no one said you can touch…”
3891 2018-07-13 22:47:43 2 bad Putin is on the right side of history in this aspect.
IT seems he wants good relations with the west, the military complex/oil industry is not happy with that.

Can we prevent climate catastrophe if the US has 
1067 foreign military basis, how much co2 is that ?
3892 2018-07-13 22:47:34 I came to Nissan just to change the car oil. All of that turned into a transmission whatever. Had to get a rental had to return the rental cuz they fixed the issue now im barely on my way to my aunts since 9am this morning 
3893 2018-07-13 22:47:29 @realDonaldTrump We have plenty of oil here and shale from fracking and natural gas.We don't need to get oil from another country that hates us, funds terrorists and holds us hostage to speculators who speculate oil might be scarce 6 months from now then 6 months, it never was
3894 2018-07-13 22:47:13 Not too many seem to notice but things flare up again in Middle East:
- Escalating protests in Southern Iraq due to shortages, could hamper oil exports
- Election in Pakistan with a lot of uncertainty against backdrop of bombings and Sharif arrest

3898 2018-07-13 22:46:46 Sturgeon is more likely to produce caviar for her voters than May is herring for the fishing fleet.  Scotland still has a few drams of oil, it hoards for the rainy day.
3899 2018-07-13 22:46:42 You still haven’t mentioned the economic war wages by the US or the massive slump in the world oil price.
3900 2018-07-13 22:46:41 No one is pro oil spill. Don't be so dumb.
3901 2018-07-13 22:46:35 hmm i would recommend a good setting powder bc that is what controls all the sweat and oil production. any foundation will become oily and break up after a certain amount of time. would recommend maybelline fit me powder or the rimmel pressed powder in translucent. all drugstore!
3902 2018-07-13 22:46:35 Oil?
3903 2018-07-13 22:46:32 I agree. Who wants to see that snake oil salesman, who’s been nothing but a conniving political spin-doctor for the last 50 years, recite a bunch of lies, solely to save his ass from prison invasion? He should save his words for Mueller’s team for whom he’ll be under oath.
3904 2018-07-13 22:46:26 Crooked lapdog pence. You and mother and your bros lapping up those federal dollars. Giving your neighbors contaminated oil soaked drinking water. Damn it.
3905 2018-07-13 22:46:24 Peter knows... he knows all to well. Sovereignty is the only solution as once a nation becomes sovereign all EU citizenship ends. Repatriation should begin. Be humane; rebuild a nice city in Libya w Libyan oil proceeds and tell them; here is your fair chance.

3910 2018-07-13 22:46:10 “ . . . “

Response? Yes.

“Yes.”

How could he answer that on his own?

Because he saw Hajime. He knew who he was. But it was something that wasn’t normal to understand.
3911 2018-07-13 22:45:55 Little more butter (with olive oil added to keep it from burning) in the pan too. Crush some garlic up and mix it in as well...not too many in the pan too quickly either.

3913 2018-07-13 22:45:18 Have you tried peppermint oil on a rag or paper towel? Use that here in Texas, seems to work. 2 or 3 strategically placed on a patio and you're bug free. Pleasant smell also, not as bad as citronella which doesn't seem to work here. A dropper full on each rag or towel.

“Yes.” He did answer truthfully. Why lie?

Even though, he felt hate to this student for being part of this school that used him.
3947 2018-07-13 22:40:58 Besides, the "follow the money" argument actually works the other way around. Even if "big oil" had spent $100,000,000 on it (they haven't), US govt. spent $26 BILLION on climate change research by 2010 (official GAO report).

Much, much more by now.

I'm proud to be one of the "nuts" back in 1995 telling people #babypowder & baby oil cause cancer.

Yeah baby oil is mineral oil, a petroleum (crude oil) distillate, used as cutting fluid in industrial process. CANCEROUS 

Anyone remember the #Neways company?
3961 2018-07-13 22:39:10 2/ 5. Farmers are voted for a man who cares nothing for climate change and that affects their crops. So stupid is as stupid does. Also GMO is in Trumps pocket. 6. Oil ppl pollute the world and kill the environment. ...

3965 2018-07-13 22:38:44 Or......another REALLY REALLY creative way to keep the price of oil down is to let it go up.

4023 2018-07-13 22:28:51 Thinking of experimenting with oil pastels.
4024 2018-07-13 22:28:50 You do know that Obama and Hillary completely destoyed countries & lives forever. They interfered & started wars in Lybia, Syria & Egypt.  The war in Syria was all about an oil pipeline. You know this. The whole world knowxs this.
4025 2018-07-13 22:28:43 Dude it’s been a minute since I’ve got a oil change 
4026 2018-07-13 22:28:14 Driving south from Ullapool yesterday passed tanks with whisky going south to be bottled and exported as British trucks loaded with pine logs getting taken out of Scotland and an oil tankers headed south as well fed up being robbed of our resources!! #DissolveTheUnion

4041 2018-07-13 22:26:35 @OtterBox my iPhone 6s Plus screen protector has this rainbow like splot on it like car oil but it is as part of the plastic. What is up with that? Also it feels like one side is really sensitive to button presses compared to the other.
4042 2018-07-13 22:26:27 Ha I do it a few times a week.
4043 2018-07-13 22:26:16 The implied bounce in this ratio might just mean the inflation print (oil price) falls further than gold.
4044 2018-07-13 22:26:03 To get rid of mice - a bit of kitchen towel with some peppermint oil. They hate the smell and won't come back. Just put it wherever they're getting in or have been spotted. Humane and cheap.

4058 2018-07-13 22:24:17 Google works quite well. You should try It! Ask it questions like does China buy its oil from Iran? Then once you finish researching that try one on Stanley Myer's concept car... then get back to me! Otherwise stay quite living under your rock! Grown ups are speaking!

You eat/wear clothes? Fuel/raw materials from BO. You heat/cool your home? BO fuels electricity generators.
4072 2018-07-13 22:21:53 They offered to wash my car after my oil change. He said “we definitely can do that for you.” Okay bae. I see you.
4073 2018-07-13 22:21:24 Thank you for your question and apologies for the late reply. Diffusion of those same essential oils should be avoided (such as Rose, Basil, Clary sage, Juniper berry, Rosemary, Jasmine and Nutmeg. Basically any essential oil that could possible affect the hormone levels.

Looks like that crazy cult leader is trying to sell more snake oil.

Lmfao what a weirdo.

A good rule re: new age. The more specific the material, the less truth there is. That's the fucking point of Gnosticism.

So don't fall for the scripted b.s. of cults.
4076 2018-07-13 22:21:07 Veremos que hace en proximidad U$S11.05 (seguramente toque ahi), viene bien pero precisa volumen. El oil juega su partido tbn, puede quedarle algo mas de baja.

4081 2018-07-13 22:20:36 Get a spray bottle and put ACV, dilute it with distilled water & add some essential oil for fragrance. Helps kill bacteria & relieve itching

4085 2018-07-13 22:20:08 Where did you this info from, reference please. I gotta admit the Americans are unlike Russians where Russians still do colonies straight up caring less about public opinion. Americans on the other hand got Saddam to invade Kuwait to have Iraq under sanctions n then steal the oil
4086 2018-07-13 22:19:59 Here is the award winning Orodeal &. if Carlsberg did Olive Oil probably the best & most charming olive farmer 
4087 2018-07-13 22:19:57 True, however, oil is less commonly seen, and of course you can mix water, oil and silicones to create various hybrid lubes too!
4088 2018-07-13 22:19:38 Maybe just because Venezuela doesn’t obey U.S. imperialist acts.
People of Venezuela lives for their honors,not like Americans or British for oil.

4090 2018-07-13 22:19:23 Can anyone explain to me if we are producing so much oil why is gas so high, seriously?
4091 2018-07-13 22:19:16 Essentially I mixed 2 tbsp gochujang chilli sauce with 1 tbsp of brown sugar and veg oil + 2 tbsp water, mixed with 700g chicken thighs and bake 200c for approx 30 mins. Serve with toasted nuts, cos lettuce and rice pancakes. Voila! X
4092 2018-07-13 22:19:11 Nonetheless, if Germany were to be involved with a NATO response to Russia while receiving 70% of their oil from Russia it could leave Germany w/ few 2 no options against economic disaster if Russia controls their oil supply.  Results would be disastrous.

4112 2018-07-13 22:16:48 You are blatantly lying!  He said that Germany was wrong to have dependence on Russia for oil.  He also thought it was wrong of them to only give NATO 1.1% of GDP and BILLIONS to Russia for their oil when the US spends billions on NATO for the UN defense against Russia!
4113 2018-07-13 22:16:42 Remember Banana, chicken is always a good choice for a treat. But he needs taurine and amino acids. Maybe he’s got irritable bowel, fish oil helps with inflammation. NO WHOLE MILK.  Try him on some baby food, give him time to get better, Slowly ease him back into can food & see

4126 2018-07-13 22:14:43 David, no one is perfect but I thought Obama was darn close.   Bush caused a war over oil which cost over 3,000 military their lives.  Obama inherited that mess

4145 2018-07-13 22:11:45 Look you call it what you want. It's paying for the costs of government now. It was originally doing the greenwashing of the oil industry but now the gov has the brains to use the rev for costs of running GOA instead of paying banks interest for this business. It's a PST IMO.
4146 2018-07-13 22:11:27 russia has nothing to gain from invading these nations that buy oil and gas from them
4147 2018-07-13 22:11:19 Nither as they are both suffering. The thin one is anorexic I prescribe welsh coal for it and the fat one is a glutton it needs a good washout and a few less oil rags for breakfast. 


Hmm I honestly can't pick between them both are great locos.
4148 2018-07-13 22:11:16 That has nothing to do with the resources that Europe does have. While oil isnt on that list for Europe they do have their own resources, if they didnt then their economy would be even more trashed.

4156 2018-07-13 22:10:26 yeah like trump exposed the NATO bullshit for what it is,germany buys oil and gas from russia they need russias resources russia needs there custom ,no need to invade
4157 2018-07-13 22:10:23 Pubmed yr syndrome. read. save articles, set alerts.
find ergonomic aids to avoid more stress. put some oil on the owie.
ice it for 20 mins. mostly you've got a chronic sprain. 
I have used vet wrap everywhere.

I never had long nails before. 
I cannot type at all. My hands hurt.
4158 2018-07-13 22:10:15 Yes, "recent" #oil price rise is #Iran policy. But the increase follows a 1.5-yr project to drain global stocks & raise prices, inventory that would soften the blow of this price jump. Stocks drained by design. Ask the #OPEC stairwell. So why can't consumer nations respond? #OOTT
4159 2018-07-13 22:10:11 Yum: sambal chilli oil curried collard green pizza! #FoodBaby

4161 2018-07-13 22:10:01 So you see how this didn't actually matter for the version you made. A little frying isn't going to de-flavor chili oil.

4163 2018-07-13 22:09:39 Hi. Do you need a licence to collect knives e.g. Decorative ones with oil slick blades? These would be put in s high display case lockable
4164 2018-07-13 22:09:25 @BabestationTV omfg @AshleyEmmax is at her best tonight bring the #Xrated filth  I’m prying she gets the #Oil out and get even filthier tonight #OilFans #OldSkool #PhoneSex
4165 2018-07-13 22:09:20 Yes. Ins deductible then we keep about $500 in there for oil changes etc. But my current repair bill is close to $3000. So I need to rethink this as we are at 100,000 miles.
4166 2018-07-13 22:09:17 So Trump's call to the Saudis didn't  help. What a surprise. Anyway he can ask Putin Monday, They have also oil I heard.
4167 2018-07-13 22:09:15 I wouldn't start with sesame oil - it has a fairly low smoke point and continued frying can mess up its flavor. I'd sautee the garlic in a neutral vegetable oil (canola, corn, whatever) and add the sesame oil closer to the end
4168 2018-07-13 22:09:13 “Oh? Rookie mistake”

A smirk formed

4174 2018-07-13 22:07:40 today’s random but stellar meal: turkey breast sautéed in local garlic & onion; kale, yellow zuke, and basil sautéed in chilli oil; all mixed in w quinoa and garlic tomato sauce topped with kalamata olives. much better than expected.
4175 2018-07-13 22:07:27 A theme with Arab commentators and lobbyists is that they will always press for more war and confrontation, because 1. They don't have to do it themselves 2. Higher oil prices make them a nice profit.
4176 2018-07-13 22:07:26 Its not a war. It never was. Its an occupation. If there wasnt money to be made off opium and oil the US wouldnt give two shits about Afghanistanq
4177 2018-07-13 22:07:15 Im highly irritated that i can't find my oil right now, that i just bought last week
4178 2018-07-13 22:06:52 CBD oil has literally changed my life and made dealing with Chron’s so much easier!!
4179 2018-07-13 22:06:39 slice it like pretty thick potato chips, toss it in olive oil and some salt & pepper roast it in oven on a cookie sheet for about 30 plus minutes. Top with Parmesan when you take it out of oven... deeefuckinlicious

4183 2018-07-13 22:06:18 Good morning this morning. Its cold outside, its warm in here and we are open for business on #thecradle @SAfmRadio @maratoaka, nice to have you with us. lets burn the midnight oil.

4185 2018-07-13 22:06:06 I have a solution for @realDonaldTrump to keep the price of #Oil down. This is something so special that none of the @federalreserve 750 economist could figure it out. Here it is "How To Keep the Price Of Oil Down" *Let it go up*. It's called Price Discovery. #FreeMarkets
4186 2018-07-13 22:06:06 Changed oil in my Jeep. Apparently there's a leak...
4187 2018-07-13 22:05:59 Have to take fish oil tablets
4188 2018-07-13 22:05:58 To make sure we cast out any doubt on our intentions post 30 July. Why would Grace be graced with such an office? For the why! Scarfists are running out of oil now!

4190 2018-07-13 22:05:52 Was it made of biodegradable plastics?

How much CO2 and hydrocarbons did his protest add up global warming!

Not very green of him was it.

4193 2018-07-13 22:05:32 These days the State Department is being run by terrorists & traitors. At least toward & at the top. The entire cabinet is corrupt or has evil in their agendas, led by a tool of the enemy. McMaster was the only honorable man in the bunch. The jury is out on Mattis. Tillerson: oil
4194 2018-07-13 22:05:29 If people don't want to be thought of as rubes, then they shouldn't follow after a snake oil salesman from NY who is a perfect example of east coast values, and then claim he represents the people in the heartland. He's pissing on the heartland right now.

4199 2018-07-13 22:04:18 getting an oil change is a more satisfying form of self care than getting a mani pedi for me

4201 2018-07-13 22:04:08 Well, immigrants aren’t filled with oil, so of course he’s on their side.

4203 2018-07-13 22:03:55 Well, he DID take money from Bin Laden's family some years earlier to bail out his nearly bankrupt Arbusto Oil Company. But then, his timing was always off. (Especially when 4 weeks after taking office he shooed away a  transition adviser warning him about the Bin Laden threat.)
4204 2018-07-13 22:03:44 In many cases does Native American tribes refused to free their slaves. Maybe it is time that they pay reparations. From the casino business and oil Business,

4209 2018-07-13 22:03:09 How you gonna have a 710 cup with no oil? Dumb.

4212 2018-07-13 22:02:54 It is. Texas consistently ranks in the top-10 GDP by state and when oil is >$70/bbl we're in the top 3. But we're also 43rd nationally in education and it shows in the fuckwits running things here. Including our indicted AG & anti-lawsuit Governor who made MILLIONS in a lawsuit.

And you will provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a gallon of olive oil to moisten the choice flour, as a grain offering to the Lord; this is a  perpetual statute.
4232 2018-07-13 22:00:54 I don’t know. Could be the injector loom which suffers from oil travelling up it or maybe an injector seal. Or something else! It got me here anyway, just underpowered. Got to love a Landy ... they just keep going.
4233 2018-07-13 22:00:46 No but salt and oil can. That "sandwich" is v salty and probs pure oil.
4234 2018-07-13 22:00:39 Trump is going at Putin's wallet. If he gets the German deal terminated, he makes Russia weaker by billions. makes Europe stronger strategically and makes our gas & oil industry billions...that they pay taxes on to Trump....to cover costs.  Stable genius meets Putin and smiles.

4244 2018-07-13 22:00:01 RETWEET if you’re glad that America is the world’s number one producer of oil again! 
4245 2018-07-13 21:59:50 I see Mr Murdoch is terrified of Trump meeting Putin and may come to an agreement on Syria ..you see Mr Murdoch has invested in the oil and gas in the OCCUPIED Syrian Golan Heights ,so he has got his "Trusted " Pal Neil to slag off Trump and Russia to hold on to his investments .
4246 2018-07-13 21:59:48 Nah when a get back to ibiza im ligit draggin meself out of bed every day before 12 and lathering myself in oil... cannit cope with everyone asking if i left me tan there

I have carrot oil for sale o , and coconut oil... 
Making these oils actually make me happy, and alert will make me feel fulfilled. You can get a combo of 100ml ( carrot and coconut oil) for 2k. Edakun.
4248 2018-07-13 21:59:38 Trump armed Ukraine Rebels, Trump gives Poland access to Patriot air defense missile system, Trump strengthens US military, Trump moves troops to Baltic, Trump tells Germany cancel Russia oil deal. Seems like Trump is doing pretty damn much to thrawt Russia.
4249 2018-07-13 21:59:36 Easy answer to this, donny. Take all your servicemenand women back from Europe to the US and have the biggest home guard on the planet. We are sick of you having your stepping stone to the oil wars on our land, anyway.

4256 2018-07-13 21:58:12 The inevitable came with a huge 2-day oil slide. Unlike the prior rally that occurred with the announcement of HIGHER U.S. inventories, this week's drop came on news of LOWER inventories.  So much for market manipulation rules!  Now, Trump threatens to release strategic reserves!

4266 2018-07-13 21:57:01 Oil equals corruption. Yes, we are dependent today, and yet we have the power to start moving in another, better direction. We have to stop always making decisions based on short term profit. Let's see what payoffs they offer to the tribe. #TruthAllies #SaveTheEarth

4285 2018-07-13 21:54:28 Pro Tip: Once you've finished off your preserved roasted red peppers, combine the oil mixture 1:1 with balsamic, shake thoroughly in a mason jar and you have a roasted red pepper vinaigrette.

4290 2018-07-13 21:53:33 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
4291 2018-07-13 21:53:30 These wealthy old fools think oil will continue for the next 10yrs? 

It won't even make it to 5yrs, he's gonna file for bankruptcy soon.
4292 2018-07-13 21:53:23 well if jay park is gonna continue on with that raggedy ass twist out simone needs to tell him to use more oil when he’s untwisting
4293 2018-07-13 21:53:06 The EPA answered the letter from @ChuckGrassley and me & told us that former Secr Pruitt & the agency granted all but 5 requested oil refiner waivers for 2016 & 2017.  They granted 48 of 53 since 2016. This completely undermines the renewable fuel standard.  Now we want the names
4294 2018-07-13 21:53:02 Tell us about ur family oil company bankruptcy? And taxpayers footing the bill to clean it up mess??
4295 2018-07-13 21:53:01 Got coconut oil on my tiddies living lavish lmao
4296 2018-07-13 21:53:00 And we thank you and your family for all the pollution cause by your failed oil business. But you're a great guy I'm sure.
4297 2018-07-13 21:52:58 I grew up in HB! Had sun poisoning many times with blisters - I now have the freckles to prove it . I’m light hair with fair skin and back in the late 80’s I was all baby oil at the beach for that “perfect” tan. I am a sunblock whore now 
4298 2018-07-13 21:52:58 Lord, anoint my head with Your oil. My mind is full of worries and anxious thoughts. I need you to come and bring Your peace. Jesus, I need You.

4301 2018-07-13 21:52:40 The research into consciousness is only in its infancy. Much like quantum physics where mystics and supernaturalist run amuck, it will be a fertile area for supernatural folks to sell their snake oil. Just have to put up with it for the time being.

4307 2018-07-13 21:51:42 I've found it to be cheaper but I don't eat processed pkged foods, pretty much fresh veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds, coconut oil, flax seeds. No grains, & grow lots of my own veggies.
4308 2018-07-13 21:51:22 Who wanna let me slide on them I got big gas and oil lmk got the Xbox on me too 
4309 2018-07-13 21:51:11 Energy in Depth is a shill for the oil/gas industry and is dedicated to blocking a switch to renewable energy. Obviously they have no credibility.

4311 2018-07-13 21:50:57 Other than coconut oil wat is some other good hair oil to use ?
4312 2018-07-13 21:50:57 Seems the typical fatty acid mix for high-fat mouse diets but uses plant fats instead of lard. 

"...cocoa butter, coconut oil, menhaden oil, palm oil and sunflower oil."

High saturated, high omega-6, low omeg-3.
4313 2018-07-13 21:50:50 Mmmm no la veo Charly. No la veo. Rebote chiquito técnico muy técnico puede haber. Solo imagínate si hay alguna sana toma en el spx y en el oil que puede darse la próxima semana. A donde vamos?
4314 2018-07-13 21:50:48 Its relentless, they even talk in their sleep!
Now and then I get to hide in the toilet for a while but Im considering working on an oil rig or going to prison for a break.

4316 2018-07-13 21:50:13 Remember that time nobody was upset that Russian brides dropped 84% in value? Of course not, nothing we love more than a discount on Russian trash and saving bonds. Other than middle East oil discounts (bribbbbbery) savings investment incentives.
4317 2018-07-13 21:50:12 Is it nut (macadamia/ Argan oil) free? I struggle to find any skin treatments that work that I can actually use! My email is roamblogger@gmail.com
4318 2018-07-13 21:49:58 Hmmm, so are the vegetables toxic if we don't remove the oil from them first? 
4319 2018-07-13 21:49:54 Most supermarket own brand gluten free pasta is actually not that bad these days. Also, you may be able to eat the green part of leeks or spring onion, which makes a good onion sub, especially if you cook it in garlic oil (which I think you're still allowed?)
4320 2018-07-13 21:49:53 The coconut oil on my kitchen counter has liquified. It’s too hot.

4323 2018-07-13 21:49:44 Oh yes get on that 1800s oil painting pillow business
4324 2018-07-13 21:49:42 What about the calories in olive oil??
4325 2018-07-13 21:49:41 I mean getting her nails and hair done cute but, have you ever got her oil changed? Paid a phone bill? Filled her tank up? “Here bae here go some money for groceries” Take care of her that way she can have that money to do whatever, i.e. nails & hair.
4326 2018-07-13 21:49:31 She should be embarrassed!! Taking our money so we can protect Germany from Russia gets all her oil from Russians 

What kind of Caca is that!
4327 2018-07-13 21:49:20 Confirmation bias? I read Poloz as dovish. Every chance he has he says 'look, inflation is not a concern'.  See how smart we were with the oil bust? See the natural growth rate is edging up! He fears disinflation 10x more than inflation.

4333 2018-07-13 21:48:58 When it comes to sucking off of our tit they are. But the former chancellor making a deal to go through the water to bypass Russian oil into Germany is a bigger tit.
4334 2018-07-13 21:48:57 Overtly misleading and grammatically incorrect to boot. Well done, snake oil salesmen.

4342 2018-07-13 21:48:21 I hope they keep the oil stays in the United States!

4344 2018-07-13 21:47:48 Because of “Double Standards” standards ladies. Simple as that! Progressivism in order to work, has to supersede and go around the Constitution. Progressivism is like oil and water with the Constitution.

4349 2018-07-13 21:46:58 there's like one hit of oil left though....
4350 2018-07-13 21:46:54 how about some oil changes
4351 2018-07-13 21:46:47 Whole nother level of stupid.
4352 2018-07-13 21:46:34 But if they import their oil and gas from US they still don't have energy independence.. Or should Germany annex a oil rich nation?
4353 2018-07-13 21:46:15 Michael hums in content when Sam's hand moves over his oil gland. 

"That feels very nice. How did you know about my oil gland?"
4354 2018-07-13 21:46:15 Yes i agree. All of the west buys oil from enemy or potential enemy countries. Why? Because democrat epa nuts wont let us drill enough of our own. Again, its ALWAYS democrats helping our enemies the most.

4360 2018-07-13 21:45:16 O's, Donnie slams everyone without considering what he's saying/implying.  As for Germany, the pipeline was started 10 years before Putin ordered the invasion and annexation of the Crimea.  The USA has bought oil and natural gas from Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
4361 2018-07-13 21:45:15 Watch this spa-

FUCK, WE HAVE OIL AND WMDS, I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING :(
4362 2018-07-13 21:45:10 Energy was among the best-performing sectors as oil prices continued to recover from a heavy midweek sell-off, which was fuelled by fresh worries about the potential impact of a trade conflict between the US and China.  FT
4363 2018-07-13 21:45:03 You're no oil painting Watson
4364 2018-07-13 21:44:54 Seems to be a pretty narrow discussion if the question only is rights of oil companies vs rights of indigenous lands. Saskatchewan is much bigger than that.
4365 2018-07-13 21:44:50 oh yeah i make lots of salad w no lettuce. i do this one tomato+mozz+mint or basil+very big oily croutons, lemon juice and more olive oil and minimal salt n pepper
4366 2018-07-13 21:44:48 100% tarrifs on all Russian Imports.  Sanctions on all Russian oil exports. That is just for starters.
4367 2018-07-13 21:44:46 cramps had me feeling like shit, so I put some lavender essential oil on my lower back and now I feel so relaxed.
4368 2018-07-13 21:44:23 What? Huh? Oil? Who said something bout oil? Bitch is you cooking?!
4369 2018-07-13 21:44:10 Turmeric is wonderful. If you cook with it, make sure you add pepper or have it with some oil - the healing qualities are released when combined with these ingredients
4370 2018-07-13 21:43:45 6) Some Arab states have been trying to buying Putin either through oil & gas projects or nuclear reactor construction or weapons are also another example about the lack of proper knowledge about various corners of this conflict. They think by coupe of billion dollars project
4371 2018-07-13 21:43:32 There’s so much that goes into a chip. It could be salt on top or brine soak before dry/fry or the kind of oil or double frying or kind of potato. Too many variables. What happens with different shapes from same chip shop?

4375 2018-07-13 21:42:53 We are considering tapping our oil reserves.

To bring down oil, and thusly, gas, prices? Yes.

Foolish?

Not with the incredible amount of oil that we take out of the ground now and the total of which continues to ramp up daily to new highs.
4376 2018-07-13 21:42:36 U see d “drilling crude oil” guy......
4377 2018-07-13 21:42:34 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. There's seems to be a lot of squeakies about at the moment.
4378 2018-07-13 21:42:22 U.S. Commerce Department approves request to exempt certain steel imports related to oil and gas industry for Shell and Chevron based on an inability to source them in the U.S., according to a government document
4379 2018-07-13 21:42:16 That’s why they are pointing out the oil line being put in. We can do all we want but as long as the EU continues buying billions worth of gas from Russia their economy will continue to grow. Sanctions will not stop anything unless the entire NATI group supports it.
4380 2018-07-13 21:42:12 You know there's overlap betweenness disputed land between the two right?  It's geopolitics about money, power, and control over oil/gas/geography
4381 2018-07-13 21:42:01 It's a new form of asset class.  Most commodities have massive increases in supply when demand increases. (ie the price of oil goes up, more people go out to drill).  But more Bitcoin miners increase security not supply.
4382 2018-07-13 21:41:48 Soooo that oil treatment??¿ bcccccc 
4383 2018-07-13 21:41:39 lost my oil pen at a concert  it is a sad week
4384 2018-07-13 21:41:31 @zizzyphus Can the essential TT oil/water mix be scented with some fragrance nicer than that natural camphor scent, or would that just render it ineffective? Is it the odor or the chemistry of the order that keeps them away
4385 2018-07-13 21:41:24 ありがとう

4391 2018-07-13 21:40:57 I can change a tire, move shit, and mow grass. I’m sure I could figure out how to change oil if I had too.
4392 2018-07-13 21:40:51 what about oil rich muslim countries that dont accept palestinians or syrians?

4394 2018-07-13 21:40:38 60 is in U S D. Skip auto pilot, and you save 10k,  also very low fuel cost, no oil to change. You need to do "total cost to own". FYI, I just got this car here in Southern CA.
4395 2018-07-13 21:40:38 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4396 2018-07-13 21:40:37 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4406 2018-07-13 21:39:42 No, I don’t miss the clean energy option.  I would rather burn oil and pollute the environment. What a dumb question.

4432 2018-07-13 21:36:11 Hawaii is one of those places that just cries out for #nuclear. One GW class LWR on Oahu and SMRs on the other islands. Think of how much they would save in fuel cost and emissions. They are oil fired right now.
4433 2018-07-13 21:35:44 When you live alone you can have smoked mackerel, black trufle oil crisps, and Prosecco for dinner.

4434 2018-07-13 21:35:30 Oil based will be significantly harder to clean, takes longer to dry, and it’s typically only available in glossy sheens. I’d say acrylic is more user friendly and versatile

4442 2018-07-13 21:34:31 Axios is reporting that Trump is considering releasing oil from OUR emergency supply to coincide with the midterm elections to bolster the Repubs. Is this even legal? I know it’s morally reprehensible, but legal?

And that is really saying something.
4448 2018-07-13 21:33:40 Well, the Brits are okay.  But, why did they layoff the folks who kept the oil boiling to pour on barbarians at the gate?

4454 2018-07-13 21:33:19 So Risa, give us technically and financially feasible proposals instead of motherhood criticisms that have always been the rant of the terrorists in all administrations ever since. What are your your proposals vs the strong USD or doable steps to combat the high oil price?
4455 2018-07-13 21:33:10 Accidental. There's overwhelming evidence that his strategies are based on ignorance. Undermining press scrutiny is working for him, sure. But look at who he's convincing. His supporters defend his fickle hypocrisy. We should sell his base snake oil and make our millions.

4467 2018-07-13 21:31:15 It's so weird! I was getting an oil change today and the same thing was happening

4473 2018-07-13 21:30:36 It makes me laugh. In for an oil change & they tell you that it’s going to take the capacity the car takes. Like they’re going to get even close to emptying even drop of oil. LOL!!
4474 2018-07-13 21:30:20 I just heard some girl say “all the oil on my face acts as my natural highlighter.”

Working with your historic enemy @Russia getting oil/ gas from them and cutting away your nuclear plant/ coal which leave Germany largely DEPENDENT on your historic enemy is the STUPIDEST thing. Germany is part of @NATO, and Russia can't get a foothold on its member.

4478 2018-07-13 21:29:50 I truly loathe getting my oil changed .
4479 2018-07-13 21:29:46 i was supposed to get my oil changed 3000 miles ago on a scale of 1-10 how bad is that lmao i don’t wanna go
4480 2018-07-13 21:29:42 I always feel super uncomfortable at oil changing places
4481 2018-07-13 21:29:41 BTW the MSM & Democrat Socialist Party goes nuts but if I was Trump I would squeeze Germany & Italy and the rest of EU to stop buying oil from Putin & buy from us.  You would see how fast Russia would descend to the 3rd world country they really are now
4482 2018-07-13 21:29:38 @TroyBilt - I have your high trimmer TB685ECHO - 2 years old - motor leaks oil though the carb. My Sears low end trimmer lasted 5 years - and I gave it away - still running.  This quality is terrible - why? $199 disposable trimmer?

4488 2018-07-13 21:28:55 I had one ask me how much an oil change was and they started crying
4489 2018-07-13 21:28:54 She looks like she just drank castor oil. Cant blame her! Hes more disgusting than drinking sour milk mixed with vinegar.

4515 2018-07-13 21:24:39 Most cars are 3K miles for oil changes, with an average american driving 15k miles a year, that means you won't be needing them every month. Detailing is a luxury imho, because one could do it themselves (just not as good) :D

4525 2018-07-13 21:23:50 Juan Williams is such a hypocrite!!
4526 2018-07-13 21:23:39 Yup I understand. I was suggesting keeping the account balance at the balance required for the deductible, use that account for winter tires or oil changes etc, and when you do, then pay 50/month to replenish back to deductible.
4527 2018-07-13 21:23:35 I love Walnut oil on salads and I cook chicken in it on lower heat sometimes as well.
4528 2018-07-13 21:23:27 Go acrylic. Basic is a good brand and less expensive. You should be able to find a starter pack. Oil paints take days to dry and have a lot more complex consistency. Id avoid for just starting out. Also make sure you get canvas that is well stretched, should be taught like a drum
4529 2018-07-13 21:23:23 There should be a way to break down oil based plastics and reuse said petroleum as recycled fuel for ships/ car/ electric.. or maybe I’m just late and that already exists, idk either way it should happen
4530 2018-07-13 21:23:04 PSA to all Waianae ppl, never go to Dansens they are a fucking rip off and they lost my gfs OIL CAP, and instead of saying something they just put a different one on it that didn’t even screw in so oil was spilling AS SHE DROVE. So dangerous and careless of them. Never going back

4532 2018-07-13 21:22:58 North Dakota's oil production set a record in May due to rebounding crude prices. The state produced an average of 1.24 million barrels of oil daily in May. up more than 19,000 barrels daily from April, and more than 17,000 barrels from the previous record set in December 2014.
4533 2018-07-13 21:22:55 I mean, I'm just seeing stressful tweets about their elections about. It's only them every time. Not like there's crude oil or something there.

4535 2018-07-13 21:22:51 @ShelYoutubery , I was told to contact you about this. 

So.. I have this itchy, more burning rather, smelly issue. I think it originates out of Ohio, maybe even North Carolina. Will tea tree oil help? I don't think the vagina "expert" knew what she was talking about.

4540 2018-07-13 21:22:05 My insurance said I could have a deductible of $500 or $1,000 -- I haven't decided which to choose (difference is $70/year in premiums)

I was thinking deductible + extra for winter tires, oil changes, detailing, anything extra.
4541 2018-07-13 21:22:03 We are soon to be oil independent we produce 5.5 Million barrels which will increasing to 11.5. -13.6 MB by 2019.  We really do not need to trade this country has always been self sufficient world trade put us in debt....

4544 2018-07-13 21:21:28 Ha, you’re funny!!! What will happen to your new relationship with Turkey when you sell out your people’s oil to Turkey and can’t deliver. But I’m sure you’re thinking that as long as you get enough goods to keep your useless military in bread and water it may last a bit longer.
4545 2018-07-13 21:21:25 2/2. The exact opposite of what you are saying. Groundnut is processed into cakes, oil and many other final products. That hasn’t driven the price up. Supply and demand determines price in this scenario.

It’s best to threaten escalated sanctions et al face 2 face to stop interference & other items like Syria.  If Merkel & EU stops oil buys.. Deep Russian Recession

4555 2018-07-13 21:20:16 The first thing my dad did when I got my car was show me how to change my tire and oil.

4578 2018-07-13 21:16:52 @WhiteHouse Small family oil businesses in US need your help. prices below $70 only hurt the small family oil companies. Don't just look at the big guys, help the little ones that voted for you and believe in you
4579 2018-07-13 21:16:49 been using castor oil on my brows/lashes Read it prevents gray hair I’m adding a drop 2 Sheamoisturizer castor leavin conditioner for now on
4580 2018-07-13 21:16:46 It’s a bit more expensive than other oils but is my prefered cooking oil. If I want flavor I use olive oil but that smokes very easily so is not good for frying at very high temperatures eg rapid stir-frying vegetables
4581 2018-07-13 21:16:03 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, the same oil and with the same heat conditions, but they don't pop at the same time, your time Isn't my time, 
but we'll all pop!!
4582 2018-07-13 21:15:37 All depends on when you buy it. I have a nice gain in it in the Value Investor portfolio but I bought when it was down on its luck during the oil bust. Value investors buy when everyone else is running away. That's where big gains are made.
4583 2018-07-13 21:15:37 I don't think it's blackmail, I think he is a willing participant. His job is to use the US govt to legitimize Putin on a global scale. 100s of billions in oil and gas, etc is the reward, along with smaller things such as Trump properties and laundering dividends...
4584 2018-07-13 21:15:32 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
4585 2018-07-13 21:15:31 Why are scumbags still hunting lions, Tigers, rhinos, and giraffes? It’s not like anyone eats that kind of meat! And the main purpose of whaling was for their oil, which was no longer needed when they discovered crude oil out of the ground.
4586 2018-07-13 21:15:19 @TheFive Will someone please explain how Germany can rationalize buying oil from Russia???

4588 2018-07-13 21:15:07 #POTUS  asked the Saudi's to release more oil to bring our gas prices down. I guess they didn't? Prices are still going up in NJ
4589 2018-07-13 21:15:01 The taste
....... picked 5 skinny green chillies but put them in hot oil taste but no heat.
4590 2018-07-13 21:14:51 @POTUS Please leave oil prices alone!!Small family oil business just starting to get out of the hole from the last 4 years.Had to cash in retirement to pay bills while prices were so low. We voted for you help us!!
4591 2018-07-13 21:14:44  That graph is the funniest crypto Snake oil sales chart I've seen

4599 2018-07-13 21:13:56 Who gone pay for my oil change I really need one!!!
4600 2018-07-13 21:13:37 Look at all the oil platforms in the North Sea!
4601 2018-07-13 21:13:37 the existence of outliers does not disprove the mean. that some things are artificially inflated like diamonds, gold, oil, etc doesn't disprove the value of the common worker. whom are the foundations of all business.
4602 2018-07-13 21:13:34 Nah, let’s go back to polio. Oh and burning oil, fracking and pollution are all fine. 

Fuckin idiots.
4603 2018-07-13 21:13:32 I oil it up :)
4604 2018-07-13 21:13:19 Why don’t you ask the billionaire arab oil tycoons?
4605 2018-07-13 21:13:17 Times have changed. There aren't enough birds to fly up your nose.

4606 2018-07-13 21:13:15 castor oil is amazing. i use it in my lashes and scalp, makes such a difference
4607 2018-07-13 21:12:46 Who can do an oil change?
4608 2018-07-13 21:12:44 Taketo was seeded at JXTG that shake up the US oil industry.
4609 2018-07-13 21:12:42 Some folks are upset about Germany wanting oil pipeline from from Russia. Two things, (1) why did Germany shut down their nuclear industry? (2) It is my understanding that it is somehow illegal to ship oil to northern Europe and Germany. Why illegal to import mid-east oil?
4610 2018-07-13 21:12:40 My wife remarked that my new vape oil smells like a burning cat and now I’m wondering what she gets up to in her spare time.
4611 2018-07-13 21:12:40 Don’t envy this umpire when he has to call time on this game 11:00 pm  #NadalvsDjokovic #Wimbledon2018
4612 2018-07-13 21:12:39 I approve. As long as he's not tossing a bag of frozen bell pepper in a pan of hot oil...
4613 2018-07-13 21:12:27 It’s cool when you make an appointment for an oil change so you don’t have to wait with a baby & then you get there it’s a two hour wait WITH an appointment 
4614 2018-07-13 21:12:16 That ain't even the half of it.  Take away all of the social contracts which enable wealth (patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc.), and take away the rights to OWN national (water, minerals, oil) and tax everyone at the same minimum rate, and nobody would be a millionaire.
4615 2018-07-13 21:12:09 Has he, he annexed a few small provinces from poor neighbors and saw trillions of his oil wealth stolen by his own retainers. The Rise of China on the other hand will be with us for a thousand years
4616 2018-07-13 21:11:53 Want to try out CBD oil which  one is the best any recommendation I don’t smoke tho! And what is the best way to take it? vape or just the oils ?
4617 2018-07-13 21:11:44 Pop some suntan oil on your Twin Pillars, obviously
4618 2018-07-13 21:11:35 We have massive oil reserves. Cannabis is about to be taxed. Banks are willing to lend money. Stop being so fucking negative and have some imagination. #Adaptability

4623 2018-07-13 21:11:08 間違ってフォローしてしまってた…！ごめんなさい!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4624 2018-07-13 21:11:08 He basically just threatened Germany  and called them out for buying Russian oil.   I’m not a global political expert. but the idea that he has taken action to help Russia isn’t realistic. Shoot . He’s insisting NATO spends more on defense.
4625 2018-07-13 21:11:06 Okay I'll remember that. Like, WMD's, mushroom clouds and Iraqi oil!
4626 2018-07-13 21:11:02 You confuse USD currency & $ unit of account. Ours has alway been a paradigm disagreement re base assumptions. Proof of paradigm is predicted outcome. If I'm correct, then as & when China & fan club bring down $ oil price as I would in their shoes USD will also fall vs CNY #OOTT
4627 2018-07-13 21:11:01 how many days has it been since my coconut oil wasn’t liquid
4628 2018-07-13 21:11:01 Yes! It is so beautiful up here.  We head back to reality tomorrow unfortunately lol but we had a great time...rented a lakefront log cabin last year and this year after friends ended up cancelling houseboat last year when the oil industry tanked and some lost jobs 
4629 2018-07-13 21:10:53 Booming crude oil and natural gas production in the Permian Basin and not enough pipeline takeaway capacity have widened the discounts at which oil and natural gas pumped in the most prolific U.S. shale basin are trading relative to the U.S. benchmarks.

4641 2018-07-13 21:09:20 Mostly a lousy week, but my husband and I did have a safe 240 mile round trip to see one of his specialists, light traffic, good weather, nice dinner after the appointment. Dr recommended cbd oil for hubby's chronic pain.
4642 2018-07-13 21:09:20 the amount of cooking oil that is used in fried food is atrocious tbh. 
eating fried food is self sabotage.
4643 2018-07-13 21:09:05 When I was laurel president I asked if we could do something instructional, and not "let's make a list of traits we want in a husband" the response was "if you plan it, we can do it." So a couple girls and I got someone's dad to teach us how to change a tire and check oil, etc.
4644 2018-07-13 21:08:47 Grape seed oil is very good to cook with....has a very high flash/smoke point, is very fluid, has a neutral taste and does not go rancid

They're going to have sex first of course. (Well, I hear that's what they're calling fucking over the world these days.)

Then, Trump will make a deal to let Putin mine Alaska for oil. 

Then a Moscow Putin-Trump tower deal.

"Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!"
4656 2018-07-13 21:07:44 Mueller indictment of Russian agents confirms that Putin did not want to  see Hillary as D nominee. Russian interests much preferred Bernie who  was the only candidate committed to raising world oil prices by stopping  drilling and pipelines.(No one expected Trump to beat either)
4657 2018-07-13 21:07:41 Breaks are usually always better to pay to be changed. 
Shit, even oil changes now are better value to pay to have done.
4658 2018-07-13 21:07:40 Protestants: why do Catholics ask Mary and the Angels to pray for them. Ask Pastors Chris, Adeboye, TB Joshua  to pray for me. why do Catholics anoint with holy water, Protestants then drink and anoint with Olive oil. Why do u call ur priest father, Then they call theirs Daddy.
4659 2018-07-13 21:07:39 don't see many reviews Today suggesting the world is to flooded with oil any time soon. Talk of capacity limits and dipping into emergency reserves despite trade wars, gulf countries, russia, libya, US shale and all the other stuff....
4660 2018-07-13 21:07:38 Like everybody opposed to oil drilling and fracking suggested it would?
4661 2018-07-13 21:07:38 Good. Me too. Off to France soon. Had a birthday this week and, miraculously, all of my kids have been in touch.
4662 2018-07-13 21:07:32 Have you guys looked to the possibility of iran pushing the demonstration forward to create a shortage in Iraqi oil export. This might give iran an opportunity to pass the sanctions since its production will cover the gab in the oil market.
4663 2018-07-13 21:07:22 》 It is the opposite where I come from. Magic is taboo, and technology climbs higher and faster

》 regardless, there is always technology, whether it is the horses plow and the farmers scythe, or forged of fire and oil.
4664 2018-07-13 21:07:16 Yeah I dont like all the GMO corn oil... did you hear about the cannibal hamsters in France? Plus they plant their crops next to non GMO farms then there seeds travel and then the sue the farmers for using there crops... It is crazy!
4665 2018-07-13 21:07:15 now that I read it again the 'after hours' reference almost feels like they're suggesting Russians stayed on after work for some spear-fishing.

Like, and I'm spitballing here, they were 'inspired' to burn the midnight oil. 

Maybe after watching TV.

4677 2018-07-13 21:05:54 I think it’s oil.  Hard to tell though.
4678 2018-07-13 21:05:48 Thank god. Terrifying.

Yeah, once the crap in the oil starts to burn it discolors the next batch.

4688 2018-07-13 21:04:29 Researching houses in Ireland over the last few years, in a vain struggle to get away from England, noticed the heavy reliance on oil heating in Ireland. Maybe their Govt could invest in helping homes have greener sources of energy too!

4691 2018-07-13 21:04:12 Cooking with it - will try that too! Thanks! Like the fact it reverts to a solid under 75° F. Great for our popcorn machine. 
Currently cook with peanut oil due to higher flashpoint. And it doesn’t get gummy like current veg oil (which started in last 5-10 years).
4692 2018-07-13 21:04:11 How do I remove the yellow stain caused by olive oil on a kitchen surface?
4693 2018-07-13 21:04:07 And that Germany is making deals with Russia for oil and natural gas.  Huh?
4694 2018-07-13 21:03:41 Did Trump not criticize Germany for making an oil pipeline deal with Russia. Under Obama ISIS ran wild. Russia took over Crimea. Our Military was devastated I hated Obama but he was our president and I wanted him to succeed. I even voted for him once. He was anti business

4714 2018-07-13 21:00:33 July 13, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4715 2018-07-13 21:00:32 Don't judge a man by the company he keeps. I suggested to a young 'un that he or she was slightly over the line. I think we're in accord. Hope all is OK with you.

4730 2018-07-13 20:58:45 Now I don't know what they call it where you come from, but when I take up a collection for one thing, and don't actually use it for that thing, well, that's dishonest. It's fraudulent. It's a scam on the level of Benny Hinn selling miracle prayer oil.

4742 2018-07-13 20:57:15 Seeing a lot of #hottakes on how straws and plastic bags aren’t the REAL problem. It’s industrial waste, big business, oil tycoons, etc. Yet none of these follow up with actual steps to taking down any of the behemoths.
4743 2018-07-13 20:57:12 The fact that prices aren't set off of the cost to produce, but by the oil futures market.

4754 2018-07-13 20:55:37 What Happened to your eyes on dp
4755 2018-07-13 20:55:36 We badly need rigorous Home Ec classes. Teach compound interest & future value, how to read a contract, buy a used car, cook something besides ramen, assemble a basic sewing/repair kit. How to fix a faucet, change oil, buy vegetables.
4756 2018-07-13 20:55:28 what about the claimed oil and gas reserves in the occupied Golan heights. 
& that in the Eastern Mediterranean basin shared by 4 countries involved in war games! the Gulf has/had already enough markets in Europe!!& heavily invested in Syria/Lebanon Crazy?
4757 2018-07-13 20:55:19 It is definitely on the list. Many great people have suggested this! Plan is to continue to treat this like a burn (as this is working well), let it heal completely, then rehydrate the sensitive skin with a little coconut oil.

4760 2018-07-13 20:55:10 Most likely posturing before meeting Putin, as leverage against OPEC+. Macro, bullish for oil, as will spur demand, delay E&D, possibly need replacing. Let mkt fix s/d, this is not a structural solution

4766 2018-07-13 20:53:31 it's not the supply as MUCH as it the lack of infrastructure to get the product to market, so HOW does dumping more oil into an already crowded CRUDE highway bring prices down? Permian Co's would love to hear that solution!

4770 2018-07-13 20:53:16 The other day I spent an hour sciencing until I realized I was using the wrong water/oil ratio and should probably sleep.

4772 2018-07-13 20:53:04 Don’t need to test them for peanut protein when you already know it can’t get there from them the oil. This isn’t magic, you know. It’s just simple, basic science.
4773 2018-07-13 20:52:19 In college my roommate kept his motorcycle in the apartment. When he moved out he generously left me with several motor oil stains for my enjoyment. It was apparently not house trained.
4774 2018-07-13 20:52:18 And why was Gaddafi murdered? Didn't he deserve to get a fair trial if he was guilty of any kind? Why did they want him out of the way so badly that he was murdered and paraded like a slain dog in his own country? Is it because he was pushing for a united Africa? Or Libya oil?
4775 2018-07-13 20:52:16 Why South Sudan? Why not Zimbabwe or Congo or Eritrea or Burma or Equatorial Guinea? Oh that’s right, they do not have any oil. South Sudan does.
4776 2018-07-13 20:52:04 Sorry, @mollygillaspie 2004 was the year that Greg Pence put the family oil business into bankruptcy and ran for the hills. (actually appointed to IDEM of all places by Mitch Daniels) All of this mess happened on his watch and as CEO, he was responsible for it.
4777 2018-07-13 20:51:58 Ugh. When you've just cleaned your car and you take it in to Mr Lube for an oil change and the chap uses a dirty squeegy on your clean windows

4785 2018-07-13 20:50:37 Las implicaciones políticas de aceptar la entrega por malversación serían muy serias. Puede resarcir el daño causado y no pierde sus derechos políticos.

4963 2018-07-13 20:27:11 I don’t think this is going to have much of an impact on US gas prices. We are running refineries at near capacity already and we have plenty of oil being produced domestically to meet demand.  We should wait to do this in 2 years when the world will be short supply.

4989 2018-07-13 20:24:10 Nathan’s fried in peanut oil. Nothing else is close.
4990 2018-07-13 20:24:00 I just paid $120 for an oil change lmaoooo fuck 
4991 2018-07-13 20:23:59 Good price. In Oregon a gram of oil runs $30+
4992 2018-07-13 20:23:46 @VP Mike Pence and family has left a legacy of polution acros three states. And state and federal money is being used to clean up their mess. SEE Kiel Bros. Oil Co
4993 2018-07-13 20:23:45 I want that oil money!!
4994 2018-07-13 20:23:42 the one at the end of way beyond sounds like "i came to have sex" even more clearly though before it goes into oil on water !!!
4995 2018-07-13 20:23:39 เหี้ยสุดดดและนี่คือกุตื่นอีกแล้วนะจ้าเพราะเจ็บ
4996 2018-07-13 20:23:38 Continued:
—starberries>mash them up and rub it all over your teeth 
—salt with charcoal- be careful not to brush to roughly, as it can damage gum and tooth enamel, brush softly 
—coconut oil pulling
—and you could also try to find a good toothpaste specifically for whitening
4997 2018-07-13 20:23:38 yes, the CIA and British MI5 plotted Mossadegh downfall, as he nationalized the Iranian oil, we all know that is the fact.
4998 2018-07-13 20:23:38 I got sunburned once in my life. Bought sunblock as soon as I could. Y’all not catching me with this “melanated kings & queens coco butter oil science” y’all be tryna put on. I ain’t buyin bridges today.
4999 2018-07-13 20:23:33 Stop causing oil spills.
5000 2018-07-13 20:23:20 I need a oil change, but by the time I get it everything is closed. Ugggh
5001 2018-07-13 20:23:17 Who knows where I can get my oil changed if I take the oil and filter myself?
5002 2018-07-13 20:23:06 Apologies for the delay in responding. You'll see whole flower in the store as of yesterday. Our third-party testing lab fell a bit behind, which caused a delay in flower release. This has not affected our oil products.
5003 2018-07-13 20:23:03 Huge development! Plus, Fritos only has 3 ingredients - Corn, Corn Oil and Salt.
5004 2018-07-13 20:22:58 Writing down so many Bru & Boegie episode ideas, like I've hit an oil line or something.
5005 2018-07-13 20:22:52 Sure must be embarrassing now that we know for a fact that Russians coordinated with Republican congressman to interfere in our elections. Actually.. what am I thinking.. either you've shoved your head in the sand so deep you might find oil, or you're a Russian troll account.
5006 2018-07-13 20:22:36 I made myself a body scrub with just coconut oil, sugar, and patchouli essential oil........ consensus is that y’all bout to get homemade body scrubs in cute containers for Christmas this year
5007 2018-07-13 20:22:32 Tea tree oil makes my scalp so happy
5008 2018-07-13 20:22:29 I agree China being forced to play hand prematurely, but ultimately if China has credible threat of advanced weaponry in satellite, hypersonics (they do) & US doesnt want WW3, then the only/best weapon US has is the USD...& CNY oil contract increasingly neutralizes that weapon.
5009 2018-07-13 20:22:23 At this point, I doubt it would be replaced. For a few years now there has been talk amongst respected opinions that the SPR does not need to sold 660 MMbbl of oil due to improved US production
5010 2018-07-13 20:22:04 Those are the bottles of oil he’s been rubbing himself with all day waiting for Rey to ForceTime with him
5011 2018-07-13 20:21:54 Today, I got to wear a bikini, get in the bathtub, with Lzzy, and hold her while Michael rubbed her paw with vegetable oil. Then we got to wash her paw. She got it stuck in a bug trap that is PURE SUPER GLUE
5012 2018-07-13 20:21:54 They did when crude oil was 32 USD. Crude oil price has now more than doubled. There is no way on earth subsidy won't have crawled back in.
5013 2018-07-13 20:21:47 If only the donations could be audited, (or the disbursement for political parties), then somebody could be put to task to explain how they could afford their generosity.

If that is from treasury, then it is you and me paying for that rice,cooking oil or livestock.
5014 2018-07-13 20:21:25 I mean if you would eat it raw, sure. But you put it in a pan with either butter or oil on a temperature that's hot enough to denaturalise proteins, which causes the bacteria to die. You would only get rid of the superficial ones as well (the same ones that get seared in the pan)
5015 2018-07-13 20:21:22 Cmon Nadel that’s it Break  back in business 
5016 2018-07-13 20:21:12 I do lol my hair now is long, curly and course. It doesn’t produce a lot of oils so when I wash it, all the good oils I have are gone and it turns into a fro lol I condition a lot and use leave in conditioner with coconut oil almost every day.
5017 2018-07-13 20:21:04 You speak confidently with so much ignorance. Oil won't be relevant in the next 10 years.
5018 2018-07-13 20:21:00 The methane emissions are now likely big enough to erase any gas advantage over oil in transportation. There is only a climate advantage when gas replaces coal. Where coal is eliminated or nearly eliminated (about 20 states), gas is a climate problem and no solution at all.
5019 2018-07-13 20:20:53 I look forward to your work in the area, Matt.  Also, if you compare SGER to CCIR, I'm sure you'll find some surprises in terms of costs to top-quartile-or-better oil sands projects.

5021 2018-07-13 20:20:29 I was born and raised in broward I’m use to drinking my oil with two plastic cups not one 
5022 2018-07-13 20:20:27 Clap'n'tan was one Dwayne Wade away from being nobody. While he was in Bloomington, I always knew where to get my snake oil.
5023 2018-07-13 20:20:20 A little bit of black Castor oil and Shea oil...as the water dries, the oils sink into my body faster. 
I exfoliate with Ku spa salt scrub 1nce a week .
At night, after washing my face with the papaya soap, I rub castor oil on my face and when I wake up my skin is usually smooth.
5024 2018-07-13 20:20:19 I've seen three different versions of this tweet. One says nationalists. One says White supremacists. one says Nazi Germany. weird.
5025 2018-07-13 20:20:10 We'll see how the coating sets up. It needs to be hard and not sticky (hence cocoa butter) but not totally brittle (hence addition of softer coconut oil).
5026 2018-07-13 20:19:58 Haha I use butter and olive oil cod I’m a fat cunt , but reckon just using olive oil will work , fuck the milk too sloppy
5027 2018-07-13 20:19:40 Plus we actually trade with them already amazingly enough. Plenty Scotch in US supermarkets, Aberdeen’s oil industry has no issue trading with Houston and they’ve been importing Aberdeen Angus beef for decades.
5028 2018-07-13 20:19:34 the coconut oil!
5029 2018-07-13 20:19:24 Damn insects!!!! Thankfully I keep peppermint oil on hand to ward off mice and ants, so I’ll see if I can whip up something!!
5030 2018-07-13 20:19:13 There are only two types of peanut butters. Jif and the healthy kind that slosh oil on you when you stir it.
5031 2018-07-13 20:19:09 That's the same strategy, he shows today in the prc, when he told Germany buy 80% of it's oil & gas from Russia, when it's just 20%(oil) / 4.6%(gas) in 2017. - Ignoring facts when it's not helpful on his #GAGA ... sorry #MAGA-Mission - My Ass is Great Again

5033 2018-07-13 20:18:45 When Hamilton Nissan tries to get more money out of me everytime I go for an oil change.. like no I have Mr. Cooper right on the phone lollll you will not be taking advantage of me 
5034 2018-07-13 20:18:36 Germany and Europe are so afraid of Russia that they buy oil from Russia. What a con job. Why are we protecting them?
5035 2018-07-13 20:18:32 Oil based perfumes will out preform any alcohol based, plus they don't evaporate. It only takes the smallest drop to fill a room with the scent.
5036 2018-07-13 20:18:27 getchu some rosemary castor oil
5037 2018-07-13 20:18:21 Bummer. Ok. Send me a message with what they find. Wonder if could be wiring with crank or cam sensor. Maybe getting oil in connector.
5038 2018-07-13 20:18:18 They have to be right off the fryer and not in day old oil and stale. Yuck.

5041 2018-07-13 20:18:15 All of his hopes, dashed in one shot of high-grade oil
5042 2018-07-13 20:18:13 my friend suggested me baby oil to put on my stretch marks, i really hope it works fr

5044 2018-07-13 20:17:59 We need more of the Office Desk and less of the Show Window in politics. Let men in office substitute the midnight oil for the limelight.

5054 2018-07-13 20:16:59 Shame to critics of Trump, no wonder all of you are mute on ethnic cleansing going on in Nigeria and Cameroon because you see truth and call it lies because of oil, you soil your hand killing Christians through jihadis #TrumpUKVisit we now know who are Antichrist. Evil is British
5055 2018-07-13 20:16:58 Im allergic to teatree oil but its good for cleansing hair so did i use it ? Yes (: , and i feel like death now
5056 2018-07-13 20:16:52 I'm stoned on catnip oil because it wards off mosquitoes. Cat wants to lick it off my face.
5057 2018-07-13 20:16:45 So then should you not compare investment in canada to other longer lead time projects. Maybe climate friendly projects like offshore oil platforms in the North Sea?  Would you agree that Carbon Pricing and restrictive policy increases the cost of extraction?ie #lesscompetitive

5059 2018-07-13 20:16:11 I believe by the end of the Mueller investigation the US government may own a minority interest in a Russian oil company through the RICO statutes. Dear ERIC Prince, please stay healthy for your day in court.
5060 2018-07-13 20:16:02 It's non-gmo, non-gluten and contains coconut oil, so clearly I can't eat one.
5061 2018-07-13 20:15:59 Just checked my profile and saw that I am at 499 followers. Only took me 2 years to get there! If any of you has a friend would make for a good #500, I assure you I'll remember that person forever. And they'll get bonus of sporadic, dry tweets about oil, SOEs, and the Wizards.
5062 2018-07-13 20:15:53 Fried donuts tossed with oil and dump into a friends new years party.

Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
5064 2018-07-13 20:15:48 And how do you know this? I didn't think vaccines were regularly tested for the presence of trace peanut protein in refined peanut oil.
5065 2018-07-13 20:15:40 It’s amazing what an oil change can do for a car
5066 2018-07-13 20:15:40 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
5067 2018-07-13 20:15:39 I remember that Hitler made a really big deal about respecting the borders of sovereign countries.
5068 2018-07-13 20:15:38 Crude oil rebounds but ends with big weekly loss
5069 2018-07-13 20:15:29 It's better to start with sugar and add a splash of water to dissolve it, otherwise it won't really melt and integrate into the coating. Don't worry about oil and water separating.
5070 2018-07-13 20:15:28 Sorry Mr Oil Palm
5071 2018-07-13 20:15:27 Russian oil prod'n peaked '86 + need to keep up w/US DoD = collapse.  Hard to starve China when every time we go to the store we give them more USD's they then use to acquire the resources they need to not starve.
5072 2018-07-13 20:15:25 its just part of the con lady wise up stop falling for the snake oil salesman
5073 2018-07-13 20:14:58 Next time try mash with olive oil, leave the milk and butter out 
5074 2018-07-13 20:14:57 I tried to taper off of Effexor. I ended up in the ER with severe withdrawals. I also use medical cannabis oil, the ER Attending stated all of the symptoms I was having was a side effect of cannabis, CHS & CVS was his diagnosis. My concerns were dismissed. I felt humiliated.
5075 2018-07-13 20:14:52 I'm reading about Helium on wikipedia. Something I find really interesting is that helium was discovered in an oil exploration well in the early 1900s, and before then we had never encountered it in a harnessable form.
5076 2018-07-13 20:14:48 got my oil changed, tires rotated, my car detailed & my tanks full 
5077 2018-07-13 20:14:45 Can I go with snake oil salesmen to the idiots.  The man knows how to play those people. While doing very little.
5078 2018-07-13 20:14:42 I noticed the marks on his arms first, then the crust on his mustache. He reeked of motor oil and it burnt my nose but it didn't disguise the booze. 
"You sure you're a detective?" I asked.
He gestured toward the road.
"If I ain't then I better return that police car."

5080 2018-07-13 20:14:40 The whole bid was bought and paid for by Qatari oil money & still being paid for in form of the blood of Nepalese & Bangledesh workers they've enslaved there to build those stadiums. It's criminal, it's happening as we speak & nobody's doing anything to stop it. #WorldCup

5083 2018-07-13 20:14:17 We don't know if peanut oil is used anymore since that information is patented. Refined peanut oil may contain trace amounts of peanut protein. Vit K shots can contain aluminum + PEG35 (castor oil), which contains a protein Ric c 3, which can mimic Ara h 2 peanut protein.

'I use baking soda to wash it, coconut oil to condition it'

Well, it appears we have everything we need for our heads and faces with those two ingredients. Cheap, effective, earth-safe.
5088 2018-07-13 20:13:50 . So just an oil change? Filter? Top off any fluids? I just paid a Franklin this morning in Braintree

5090 2018-07-13 20:13:10 Before having my bath:
I Exfoliate with a mild exfoliator St.ives apricot scrub.
 Then I use Papaya soap. Any brand is fine.

While having my bath, I use homemade black soap.
Immediately I'm done I don't wipe off the water.
I rub my body with a mixture of coconut oil, olive oil,

5093 2018-07-13 20:12:33 NRA is just a lobbyist for the gun industry. A way to con people into donating money. I use to be a member, until I figured out the scam. Next Jenelle will be donating to the gas and oil lobbyists too.

5095 2018-07-13 20:12:25 Half of its oil imports and 50-75% of its nat gas, if you believe they aren't dependent on Russia you are mistaken. That is why Obama and Bush were against NS1.
5096 2018-07-13 20:12:16 2/2 Keep in mind only 1% floats; all the rest is on the seabed. Also, plastic is made from oil. Using plastic drives the fossil fuel industry.
5097 2018-07-13 20:12:14 Whoop whoop! Dig deep enough, you'll hit oil.................actually, this is probably just mayonnaise,  keep digging guys 
5098 2018-07-13 20:12:04 It’s mandatory to sit in your towel on your phone for at least 45 minutes after a shower to give the baby oil gel time to soak into your skin.
5099 2018-07-13 20:12:00 I dunno, it's just a RI thing. I'm so used to writing checks, it doesn't bother me. What annoys me when is when I miss the oil man and then I have to mail my payment! (I usually pay the delivery guy right then.)

5103 2018-07-13 20:11:21 Yes, but Strategic Petroleum Reserve is really a relic of another era, and is no longer needed. Using it to hold down prices seems like a good use of the oil.

5112 2018-07-13 20:10:03 I can’t even sleep because the itching is that bad. I feel like I sm losing my mind. This only confirms I am done trying seizure medicine and praying CBD oil is the answer to my prayers. I need to regain control of my life back. I am slowly losing my mind and feel hopeless. 
5113 2018-07-13 20:10:01 they tried so hard to cover up the fact that it’s not argan oil 
5114 2018-07-13 20:09:52 Why do oil companies leave Can & spend $ elsewhere? Why don't they spent it here in Can? Oil company I work for cancelled all major Canadian projects.They started a billion dollar project in Saudi. Stop using oil price as a crutch.  Oil comps are spending $ just not in Can.

- cut down on dairy products 
- eat yellow and orange fruits 
- use coconut oil to moisturize your face every morning when you wake up and every night before you go to sleep
5122 2018-07-13 20:09:21 an exchange between two customers, at 3:08pm:
“burning the midnight oil?”
“hell yeah. you get the dust out of your buttcrack?”
5123 2018-07-13 20:08:59 Bloody hell, never heard of that.  Just swilling a bit of oil around?
5124 2018-07-13 20:08:50 He was changing into shorts as it was a hot day.
Hope you are all good today x
5125 2018-07-13 20:08:43 Empty threat the usa doesnt need the oil 

Trump doesnt care about europe 

China will nuke the iranians if they choke the straits
5126 2018-07-13 20:08:41 I woke up at 4:30 this morning, took a cold shower, worked, ran the stadium stairs at nippert, went to a yoga class, where i got a lavender oil massage, laid outside in the sun, got a nice lift in and now im chillin in the hot tub... ily life
5127 2018-07-13 20:08:31 A real classic for me is rice, tuna, olive oil, and hot sauce. I really just wing it on the proportions but it's super easy to make, just make sure you break up the tuna up a bit. Salt and pepper optional
5128 2018-07-13 20:08:17 ミクロカノニカルや
5129 2018-07-13 20:08:05 Long crimped hair, a gallon of baby oil and a saxophone .... classic 80s
5130 2018-07-13 20:08:02 I totally get that. And the oil man is $$$ (at least $200 each time he comes). You'd think they'd rather use Square. Or hell, even PayPal.
5131 2018-07-13 20:08:02 Since it’s National French Fry day...I might as well drizzle some hemp oil and hearts on them to make them a little healthier....
5132 2018-07-13 20:08:01 Things is so hard now that my friend now eat bread with anointing oil  #Godhelpnigeria
5133 2018-07-13 20:07:55 Alyssa update: she just poured sweetener all over her avocado toast thinking it was olive oil
5134 2018-07-13 20:07:43 It’s a common claim actually. “Believe in y and it will change your entire life.” What’s shocking is that it’s true! In that sense should we expect a world who is fed self-help snake oil all the time to actually believe that claim? I don’t think so. That takes the Holy Spirit.
5135 2018-07-13 20:07:40 I would buy beard oil, or supplements like Vit D.

Or cologne.
5136 2018-07-13 20:07:36 Well Germany taking money from NATO and then giving money for oil and gas to Russia is a fraud. That’s all I know. What a crock of shit. NATO protects Germany from the same people she has done a back room deal with for oil! #Joke
5137 2018-07-13 20:07:34 LOL. The patron saint of MLS, Lamar Hunt, used his father’s oil money to build the MLS, the Crew, and Mapfre. You have an issue with people using their parent’s money all of a sudden?
5138 2018-07-13 20:07:29 Yes, I have a co-owned Berner with DM. They are giving her CBD oil to slow down the progression. She has had great relief from it.
5139 2018-07-13 20:07:18 if oil is made from old dinosaurs and plastic is made from oil then plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs
5140 2018-07-13 20:07:13 "Nope, still out cold."
5141 2018-07-13 20:07:06 U 2 [ fanm]
5142 2018-07-13 20:07:03 Yes my dear Senator..While Obama was President!! Before Trump even took oath office. Trump isn't going to kiss up to Putin when he just put a damper in oil deal with Germany. Time for you to retire. And take Schumer with you!!
5143 2018-07-13 20:07:00 Wait... was anything fried or sauteed in "vegetable" oil?
5144 2018-07-13 20:07:00 He wants to justify lifting Russian sanctions to get Exxon’s Russian oil.
5145 2018-07-13 20:06:59 And that's largely due to how they fund these programs. Sweden made money from war profiteering, Denmark and Norway from oil. Venezuela was doing pretty good with their oil, too, until recently.
5146 2018-07-13 20:06:58 If Germany oil sector accounted for $26.8b which was a mere 1.9% of total export & Nigeria had a $39b oil export which accounted for 96% of our total export..

It is safe to say, the only competitive edge we have against Europe is closing.

We are fast becoming irrelevant.
5147 2018-07-13 20:06:53 U.S. and other countries weighing oil reserve release: WSJ

5148 2018-07-13 20:06:52 Or the oil bunkers and drydocks.
5149 2018-07-13 20:06:49 Wonder which platform will win for the Dems...
Free the pedos!
Poop in the street!
Make MS13 strong again!
A tent for everyone!
Save Russia- buy their oil and gas!
Make crime profitable!
Make everything freeee! ( including killers!)
5150 2018-07-13 20:06:37 WE JUST RELEASED BABY OIL FOR $95 !!!!
5151 2018-07-13 20:06:06 We started giving  to my son when the dr said it was safe. I think it was 12 months. And he didn't have an allergic reaction per se, but he was totally revolted by them. To this day if he eats something that has, like, peanut oil in it, he cries and has to rinse out his mouth.

5153 2018-07-13 20:05:54 Thank you @CyrilRamaphosa for all your efforts . You've been to 3 major oil producing countries (Nigeria, KSA and UAE) and all has been a success. Keep up the hard work, people's president .
5154 2018-07-13 20:05:52 The nonstop sales pitch and up selling when you get an oil change is so annoying... plus IDK anything about what they’re talking about.
5155 2018-07-13 20:05:51 I can't stop imagining Connor "throwing up" used, blackened oil and then acting like nothings happened "i feel much better now, Lieutenant."
5156 2018-07-13 20:05:48 Is the company's board now perhaps made up of persons more concerned with the company being a leader in terms of social engineering than being the premier oil and gas company in the world?
5157 2018-07-13 20:05:39 North Dakota set a new oil production record. The state is now producing 1,244,629 barrels of oil per day - an increase of 17,146 barrels from the last record set in December 2014. #oott
5158 2018-07-13 20:05:27 Northern edge of WQ1 was a bit wild, no doubt, but more-so in the pre-2010 period when it was oil services companies as opposed to IOCs
5159 2018-07-13 20:05:23 its 2018, coconut oil is our healthcare
5160 2018-07-13 20:05:13 hello, advertise in this book called Encyclopedia Nigeria for Nigerian oil and gas sector. call us on ,09061604768. you can send a mail to us on encyclopedia155@gmail.com. thank you
5161 2018-07-13 20:05:10 Another anecdote I got about Piers was that he used perform naked capoeira atop an offshore oil rig without permission, but was allowed to do so because his moves were so hypnotic and free-flowing
5162 2018-07-13 20:05:10 めいかさんのINに気づいたのは、ログアウトされた３分後だった・・・
5163 2018-07-13 20:05:05 that's a different BOP than BB and it's sunny
5164 2018-07-13 20:05:01 Apparently Black Seed Oil does wonders to the body.
5165 2018-07-13 20:05:00 What of Mr May......he was there for the most part as Trump treated his wife like a dirty doormat grabbed her hand so hard her skin wrinkled and went white. What husband stands by and says nothing as the humiliation is poured on like hot oil?
5166 2018-07-13 20:04:59 They're all small businesses that don't want to pay the fee for a credit card machine, I guess. Technology isn't a thing here. Haha. The oil man should have Square but they don't.
5167 2018-07-13 20:04:55 I just gave my dog his first dosage of CBD oil and I’m so excited to see the results over the next week or so! 
5168 2018-07-13 20:04:50 #Bakken oil production breaks old record of 1.2 million BPD, set during the oil boom of 2014, North Dakota mineral resources dept. says.
5169 2018-07-13 20:04:48 lmfao i’m finna start changing my own oil
5170 2018-07-13 20:04:44 U never see anything, inside Ikeja if e start ehn,na to trek
5171 2018-07-13 20:04:04 She returned the hug.
5172 2018-07-13 20:03:49 Since Trump has taken office, he ejected Russian diplomats, placed sanctions on Russia, & just told Germany to stop buying oil from Russia in the NATO talks. Strzok admitted yesterday that Russia's meddling has gone on for decades, including the 2012 election. What did Obama do?
5173 2018-07-13 20:03:34 Beds Are Burning - Midnight Oil
5174 2018-07-13 20:03:30 Yeah. Baba Adedibu yari gan an ni ooo. #300M as @ den. And baba ran comot frm hospital bed wen he heard Akala had received #25B oil money!!!
5175 2018-07-13 20:03:21 i can literall Barely see alf my screen bc . water (oil) damage
5176 2018-07-13 20:03:16 Globalists see Humans as a commodity.
No different to precious Metals, Oil, Wheat, etc.

They own and control everything.
Including our Governments and Media.

If we live, die, it makes no difference to them, as long as they can use us to benefit themselves.

Wake Up!
5177 2018-07-13 20:03:14 Either Olive Garden Italian or nature’s own oil and vinegar is all I got. Fuck the rest of the growth but ima be great through you 
5178 2018-07-13 20:03:12 Cxl? Confront him! Anyone pretending Trump is in cahoots w Russia is not a serious person. Trump bombs Syria who Putin supports, puts sanctions on Russia, enacts policies for US to b largest oil producer that hurts Russia, & got NATO to pay extra $34 bil which is bad for Russia.
5179 2018-07-13 20:03:05 I came for an oil change and now I'm $525 deep into new brakes and a bunch of other stuff. Having a car is expensive  but nobody walks in LA 
5180 2018-07-13 20:02:54 I didn’t know an oil change took more than an hour 
5181 2018-07-13 20:02:50 ''Please..i'm begging..''

She's crying.
5182 2018-07-13 20:02:47 Read up on the Middle Ages. Or the Roman Empire. That’s nothing. Being boiled in oil is my ‘worst death’. But there are plenty to choose from. It can take a long time to die.
5183 2018-07-13 20:02:36 Do you own ANY mineral rights or have oil on your property? We do and we KNOW what connections Stapleton has to oil companies and what he's trying to do. THAT'S A FACT! So unless you're a farm owner or owner of mineral rights, you REALLY have nothing educated to say.
5184 2018-07-13 20:02:35 hello introducing a book called Encyclopedia Nigeria for Nigerian oil and gas sector. advertise in this book. call us on 09061604768. thanks
5185 2018-07-13 20:02:08 The Tampa Bay Times is no less guilty of this than other media outlets. Recently: Failed to note in a story about oil production that the undergirding theory of drilling changed from biotic to abiotic oil; in NATO story alleged Trump ties to Russia without proof. Just this week.
5186 2018-07-13 20:02:08 First oil change in my Jetta. Of course this need some sort of special German oil that costs more... 
5187 2018-07-13 20:02:04  Am inclined to wonder if there’s a connection to _linseed_ oil being used to treat the fabric to make oilskins. Also gum and/or wax can be used with it in combo. Lin + gum  is lingum/linkum? I could be right.
5188 2018-07-13 20:02:02 大阪ならワンチャン( ・∇・)
5189 2018-07-13 20:01:50 Yes, that's what I've learnt Nam, especially olive oil and coconut oil
5190 2018-07-13 20:01:36 Only one of those little airwick oil things the other day and now my basement smells like dogme:
5191 2018-07-13 20:01:27 ''Come here. I need a hug.''
5192 2018-07-13 20:01:14 my dad taught me how to check the oil  & shit in the car 
but now he makes me do it all on my own :(
5193 2018-07-13 20:01:04 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! I boight 2 the other day and I've only had it 3 hours and I'm loving them!!
5194 2018-07-13 20:00:38 Wouldn't it be easier for you to go drink some motor oil? You tell me. Also anonymous accounts are dumb, what's your real name?
5195 2018-07-13 20:00:35 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
5196 2018-07-13 20:00:35 another strike coming to pdvsa anyone?? #venezuela #oott #oil #politicalrisk
5197 2018-07-13 20:00:24 いつかみんなに会ってみたい！
5198 2018-07-13 20:00:21 There are SO MANY places that don't take credit cards here in RI. I go through so many checks. Grace's sax, the oil man, my hair stylist, my landlord... I used to pay rent electronically but then my CU changed their method.
5199 2018-07-13 20:00:20 Spaghetti squash. Works well with a meat sauce or just drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper and rosemary.
5200 2018-07-13 20:00:05 Help!! Seeking this miracle oil called RC Oil?? I guess it’s Young Living. Local dealer w on hand stock wanted!!
5201 2018-07-13 20:00:04 Thank you love! I tried your method of using more oil than gel!!!
5202 2018-07-13 19:59:45 Ok. I was talking about the oil being stolen and sold . Salesman used to be a pristine bay. It is noes dead from all the chemicals dumped in it.
5203 2018-07-13 19:59:45 Mexico has lots of oil resources. We should negotiate with Mexico and purchase their oil instead of tapping into our U.S. oil reserves.
5204 2018-07-13 19:59:35 Hey, women love a 'bad boy'. #Fact
5205 2018-07-13 19:59:27 But liquidating back taxes is just a one off - and they were helped by an increase in oil prices. 

The real work is in getting the more sustainable VAT and CIT up significantly.
5206 2018-07-13 19:59:23 Lol. At this point money managers are far more optimistic in higher oil prices than E&P Co’s and their Boards who are loathe to invest in long-term supply (what price signal to trust)?  My friend told me to tell your friend  #OOTT
5207 2018-07-13 19:59:21 ''It aches.''
5208 2018-07-13 19:59:19 Anything to do with oil pipelines?
5209 2018-07-13 19:59:17 How do you know exactly if your cat is getting senile? We got her some puppy training pads for her since she can't use the litter box any more & now she's not wanting to use those.
She has her arthritic treats & we give her fish oil with a little bit of tuna.
5210 2018-07-13 19:59:11 Yeah, when you said you're 300 miles over an oil change, you caught OUR attention...

Glad we could help!
5211 2018-07-13 19:59:11 coconut oil and maybe tee tree
5212 2018-07-13 19:59:02 You may have heard @realDonaldTrump is weighing releasing oil from the SPR. This to me amounts to a poli stunt ahead of mid-terms. The SPR is not to be used in this way. Any drop in oil prices would be temporary and risk national security at a time when that can not be afforded.
5213 2018-07-13 19:59:01 If you want a nigga who does manual labor (changing brakes fixing act changing oil nshit) I'm not the man for you 
5214 2018-07-13 19:58:54 So you pull out of the Iran Nuclear deal, then put sanctions on their oil and then complain oil prices have gone up
5215 2018-07-13 19:58:20 He should...gas is ridiculous expensive...besides dont we have endless oil reserves?? Lolzzzzz
5216 2018-07-13 19:58:17 ''My heart''
5217 2018-07-13 19:58:13 I expect you're an oil painting are you? Ha- let's have a look at you then! A sight to behold no doubt  and a true paragon of virtue.
5218 2018-07-13 19:58:00 Oil change 
5219 2018-07-13 19:58:00 Things to be scared of this #FridayThe13th

Opposing oil and natural gas but also using petroleum for all your products. Looking at you @Patagonia
5220 2018-07-13 19:57:59 สัส กลัวแทนเลยกู
5221 2018-07-13 19:57:56 Got back on the keto diet July 1st. Down 8 pounds eating 400 calories over maintenance. Diet consisting of fatty red meat, bone broth shakes, avacados, lots of whole eggs, MCT oil, 0 carb protein powder, and coconut oil powder. Hope you’re seeing positive results so far!
5222 2018-07-13 19:57:55 Come on Donnie!!!.. drive that short home for your boy!! #oil
5223 2018-07-13 19:57:54 Oil companies are profit centers. They burn massive amounts of natural gas 2 provide heat required to crack crude 2 smaller molecules we use. Gasoline, diesel, propane, etc power our cars, trucks, tractors, etc. Their scientists study ways 2 make those processes more profitable.
5224 2018-07-13 19:57:47 yeah, you’ll need shrimp, palm oil, cilantro, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, garlic, tilapia (or another fish of your choice), malagueta pepper, salt. Cooking instructions can be found online under “receita de moqueca”
5225 2018-07-13 19:57:36 CBD Oil
5226 2018-07-13 19:57:26 I wonder if Trump is going to negotiate a deal with the  12 indicted Russians  for Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 missing emails?

5227 2018-07-13 19:57:08 Instead of releasing oil, let’s try reducing the equivalent amount of demand, just for hoots.

5229 2018-07-13 19:56:58 Get out some lavender incense burning or oil heating & let it help remove the stress. See my pinned tweet for more info on inner & outer peace.

5231 2018-07-13 19:56:45 just read an 18-month old piece you wrote 'How Shell Oil Is Taking DevOps and Agile to the Cutting Edge' on The New Stack, do you have any followup or related reporting?
5232 2018-07-13 19:56:45 @tjmitchell3 look how much she payin for s oil change T. lol
5233 2018-07-13 19:56:45 Wouldn't bother, it's a bit boring imo, it's with the fake oil
5234 2018-07-13 19:56:42 T rt 2crit Merkel 4the deal it cut w/dictatorPutin 2build gas pipeline under Baltic linking Rus.producers w/Grm consumers.Rus.always uses its mnoply over oil+gas 2control its customers. Deal makes Berlin “captive”@Russia. "Inapprop” 4txpyer 2pay EU defense if Grm's in such deals.
5235 2018-07-13 19:56:41 That's not correct. People who fund and sponsor war for control of minerals and oil are capitalists.
5236 2018-07-13 19:56:36 nah, man!!!  i'd change THEE shit outta my oil...and my wife's...if i could just let the used oil run down the driveway like we used to do in Wilkes County.  the HOA tends to frown on those things, here.  smh...
5237 2018-07-13 19:56:25 avoid using an old razor 
don’t shave over one spot numerous times 
exfoliate before shaving 
be careful with the type of shaving gel or cream you’re using 
Aloe Vera oil & Tea tree oil will get rid of razor bumps
5238 2018-07-13 19:56:24 Guess what Germans export the most? Vehicles.
Germany export of vehicles in 2017 was $257b (17.8%)

Nig 
Ships & boats - $253m (0.6%)

Even our so called champion commodity OIL, was $39b (96%) while Germany exported $26.8b (1.9%)

The bracket represent export %

Pure stupidity
5239 2018-07-13 19:56:22 vitamin e oil as a moisturizer, thank me later.
5240 2018-07-13 19:56:22 Okay @karenhunter and the coconut oil! 
5241 2018-07-13 19:56:18 President Trump, why are we in Syria? Russia was invited into Syria BY SYRIA. The United States was not! The only reason I see we’re there is because of Israel. They want the OIL! We are there for that reason.
5242 2018-07-13 19:56:10 Europe sold themselves out to putin , their lucky he's as nice as he is towards them, or he would cut off their oil and gas
5243 2018-07-13 19:56:07 cob you is, cuz a regular oil change don’t cost that much, tj oil change cost that when he had his infiniti. they stealing money.
5244 2018-07-13 19:56:05 1. Peppermint in oil, lotion or tea works great to awaken senses.
2. Study during time you absorb most, and for no more than 20 to 30 minutes at a time. You will find it easier to remember chunks of info.
3. Draw a corresponding pic of what you're trying to learn.
4. Topic???
5245 2018-07-13 19:56:03 When the guy at the oil change place said, "And here's your free car wash." I almost made out with him.
5246 2018-07-13 19:55:57 in this girl's story she was drinking from a bottle of jagermeister & i thought it was olive oil
5247 2018-07-13 19:55:41 so if oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs and plastic is made from oil then plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs
5248 2018-07-13 19:55:40 I hate having a car. Oil changes all that shit. It’s annoying. I need to marry a mechanic or a man that just knows how to work on cars.
5249 2018-07-13 19:55:26 Why would he care to meet 'ordinary' people in the UK? He doesn't care about anyone other than himself and his sycophants. He is essentially a snake oil salesman (and not so bright to boot).
5250 2018-07-13 19:55:20 Nah Winnin that’s extreme . Kuku add palm oil & egusi

5253 2018-07-13 19:54:44 I read this as I’m waiting for my car’s oil change. I’ve got no Dr. next to my name, but I’m as city as they come. Don’t want any grease on my hands haha
5254 2018-07-13 19:54:37 But we have so much oil we are exporting ?
5255 2018-07-13 19:54:35 Oil and everything else.
5256 2018-07-13 19:54:32 cook in pan with oil or butter that is hot
5257 2018-07-13 19:54:31 The G Thomas also has a giant ram on the front, can rotate and fight in any direction,burns little oil, and defeats all comers even when the General Sherman took its tires and fuel.

Upon entering the junkyard the G Thomas reportedly beeped out "I know of no better place to die"
5258 2018-07-13 19:54:12 I really really like how disgusting and slimy Venom looks in this movie. he looks like slimy veiny foreskin dipped in crude oil

5260 2018-07-13 19:53:57 I hate changing my oil  they always find something “wrong” with your car
5261 2018-07-13 19:53:55 Many thanks for your kind words and for all that you do to speak out against oil and gas pollution and waste, @vivarioarriba.
5262 2018-07-13 19:53:53 Rich tea biscuits are wonderful for dunking! I do hope you enjoy being at Palm Oil Campaign HQ Joss. You're doing splendid work! #OrangutanFriendly
5263 2018-07-13 19:53:50 Guess again Falling oil prices crush Russia.
5264 2018-07-13 19:53:49 If you're trying to lead me to drunken androids, I am MORE than willing, but i would like to suggest the use of 1. Coolant or 2. Engine oil :p
5265 2018-07-13 19:53:47 Now my hands smell like oil painting and I’m having a headache
5266 2018-07-13 19:53:44 Tariffs are starting to hurt US farmers and manufacturers, and threats to Iran have driven oil prices high. So much winning!
5267 2018-07-13 19:53:43 hi wat hi. drc just got a red shower. not beat me. at first as an oil is old.
5268 2018-07-13 19:53:31 something is cooking regarding the labor situation in #venezuela #oil company... they don't want the current administration to keep on ruling the company, decaying salaries and wages, no tools and equipments to work, continuing emigration of high and low skilled workers. #oott
5269 2018-07-13 19:53:19 We have always been at war with Eurasia.
5270 2018-07-13 19:53:15 I just changed my oil like 6 months ago too!
5271 2018-07-13 19:53:11 On a thread here someone said citronella spray will help keep them away (and isnt harmful to kids and bugs like peppermint sprays) I used the peppermint oil defused in water technique in the apartment worked wonders not too much outside though so hoping the citronella will work
5272 2018-07-13 19:53:07 So Oil is pumped into the bearings for proper lubrication?
5273 2018-07-13 19:53:05 And being a surgeon I know how easy it is to get rid of maggots, pour turpentine oil on wound, and maggots will run for their life! People have no character, like maggots! :)
5274 2018-07-13 19:53:01 Credit deserved for pursuing more of the oil taxes. Lots of oil companies owe royalties/PPT without remorse.

5277 2018-07-13 19:52:26 Job well done on buying oil at ridiculous prices at the expense of the citizens
5278 2018-07-13 19:52:12 Rest Well. Plenty of sleep, water and fish oil. Also turmeric for anti inflammatory

5280 2018-07-13 19:52:05 She loves you too and she would never eat you because you have weird oil like blood
5281 2018-07-13 19:52:00 Germany has the ability to cripple Russia by finding an alternative to buying Russia’s Nat Gas. Coal, Nuclear etc... Russia needs 100 Barrel oil to make a profit, so that’s out of the money.
This is what Trump is saying and Merkel doesn’t get it
5282 2018-07-13 19:51:42 That's my point.  What u describe is exactly why China/Russia r doing what they r doing.  Selling oil for USD valued at 1/1,250 oz gold when paper gold mkt leverage goes fr 10x to 100x means the oil seller is getting screwed.  I'd be happy to hire you on such terms if u disagree
5283 2018-07-13 19:51:32 couldn’t find my carmex so i used coconut oil to grease my lips lol
5284 2018-07-13 19:51:29 Tabinda Lari is Brand Manager of Habib Oil Mills she knows better then any one else . but she does not know media needs money only this was parties responsibility to stop all advertisements from all channels as no one had grand jalsa they all spent on all tv media 10 days lets
5285 2018-07-13 19:51:26 why did i schedule an 8am oil change at O’Brien tomorrow
5286 2018-07-13 19:51:21 小松さんにも会いたいですね
5287 2018-07-13 19:51:21 That being said, over 5 years later and 80k miles, she’s been great and never put a dime other than oil changes into her. Just wish I bought her 2 years used
5288 2018-07-13 19:51:20 trump releasing from the oil reserve will be timed with the swamp selling oil stocks before, shorting oil futures during & buying them back up just before the release is ended. @CREWcrew
5289 2018-07-13 19:51:13 Trump trying to stop Germany from important they’re oil from Russia yet all you idiots hunk Trump is colluding with Russia.  You all make zero sense my god !!!
5290 2018-07-13 19:51:10 (I only use olive oil mayo now personally, so I’m already sort of with you...)
5291 2018-07-13 19:51:08 Вбиваю в поиске oil painting, т9 исправляет на Lil painting.. ДЕГРАДАЦИЯ
5292 2018-07-13 19:51:03 Thank you so much. So great Wendy that your meds help. I’ve been taking CBD THC (at night) oil and it does help a little. So expensive this you are right. 
5293 2018-07-13 19:50:56 Cbd oil
5294 2018-07-13 19:50:52 At the end it does not translate to anything. Government sells crude oil, collects this huge FIRS revenue, recovers Abacha's loot, but nothing to show for it. Democracy in Nigeria is a big disaster.
5295 2018-07-13 19:50:49 @R60323 
なにその企画。楽しそうやん。
5296 2018-07-13 19:50:41 “I’m here for an oil change.” “Would you also like to pay for an additional $100 worth of service because your car clearly needs it?” Every. Single. Time.
5297 2018-07-13 19:50:37 boys off that good oil lol
5298 2018-07-13 19:50:34 Agree, this is not what the oil reserves are for.
5299 2018-07-13 19:50:31 This is bullish. However too much short term pain for an oil bull, hope we will see a long term gain also.
5300 2018-07-13 19:50:13 Fun fact: most oil comes from fossilized plants and tiny marine organisms.
5301 2018-07-13 19:50:08 The McTrumpcake monkeys is actively debating whether to dip into the country's emergency oil stocks as oil prices climb
5302 2018-07-13 19:50:04 #DidYouKnow @exxonmobil has partnered with @qatarpetroleum to develop the North Field – the world’s largest non-associated gas field? #Qatar is proud to work with our American partners in the oil & gas sector
5303 2018-07-13 19:50:02 Look at their bellies... That's where the oil money is going.
5304 2018-07-13 19:49:55 If you still have time before takeoff, make a firm but polite and dignified fuss. Airlines give the oil to the squeaky wheel. 
It never hurts to ask probingly what compensation they intend to give you, insist they find you an alternative route. 
Might work.
5305 2018-07-13 19:49:54 I always get nervous  when it’s time to get my oil changed! 

They always trying to get over
5306 2018-07-13 19:49:45 
5307 2018-07-13 19:49:44 Getting my oil changed and was swindled into buying a new air filter and like 2 other things I had no idea about and it was $130 HAHA
5308 2018-07-13 19:49:40 i hate getting my OIL CHANGED!!!!!!
5309 2018-07-13 19:49:37 I'm going to guess most guys with beards that are reading this post are going "wtf is beard oil?" right now.
5310 2018-07-13 19:49:29 Cxl? Confront him! Anyone pretending Trump is in cahoots w Russia is not a serious person. Trump bombs Syria who Putin supports, puts sanctions on Russia, enacts policies for US to b largest oil producer that hurts Russia, & got NATO to pay extra $34 bil which is bad for Russia.
5311 2018-07-13 19:49:29 คิดถึง(ทำได้แค่นี้)
5312 2018-07-13 19:49:28 We have gone from OPEC+ fixing an inventory overhang and helping encourage long-term investment (old fashioned way: drilling!) to Trump et al using oil as a weapon and then distorting the price signal with nonsensical messaging. And now the IEA has to clean up the mess #OOTT
5313 2018-07-13 19:49:15 #Iraq(is)' narrative to protest grievances by govt has not evolved since 2003. Trashing airports, attacking oil fields, storming hotels, or burning govt  buildings hurt everybody but least the corrupt. Yet, ppl need to show how dire their suffering is. #Basra #BasraProtests #Iraq

5317 2018-07-13 19:48:53 U.S. and other countries weighing oil reserve release. Source: WSJ report #WTI #Oil closed up .68 to $71.01, down 3.8% for the week. @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney @KilduffReport @GasBuddyGuy
5318 2018-07-13 19:48:49 That: Venezuela output heads to zero, Iran is export constrained, Libya's exports are intermittent,  Norway production is undergoing labor unrest, and yet oil prices are still struggling to hit $100/b points to the fact that something radical is happening in energy, globally.
5319 2018-07-13 19:48:46 It's a detail from a painting I'm currently working on, oil on canvas. I felt there needed to be more contrast and a focus in the painting, and since I had been wanting to paint a fried egg for some time...I took the opportunity!
5320 2018-07-13 19:48:34 JR on that oil
5321 2018-07-13 19:48:32 As long as it wasn't an airborne Marine One...

5325 2018-07-13 19:48:07 Finished my last shift of the week, which means I get to cover myself in coconut oil, put a face mask on, and relax.. does this mean I'm part of fiat 500 Twitter? I hope not.
5326 2018-07-13 19:48:02 Millions lost insurance because of Obamacare. Obama had the lowest job growth never got above 2.0 GDP. We get no oil from Iran. Gas prices have been the same for the past 4 years. ISIS held 3/4 of Iraq till Trump took them on. ISIS has been dismantled under Trump not Obama
5327 2018-07-13 19:47:48 Only 4 more days of playing piano in a cape before I become an oil painting #goals
5328 2018-07-13 19:47:44 Buy milk thistle oil at a health store and it will help with detoxing whatever you drink next weekend
5329 2018-07-13 19:47:27 What matters is USD cannot be weaponized against China, & a step further, with CNY oil & CNY gold, China can dictate the int'l flows of oil, gold, &/or the int'l trade value of the USD any time it sees fit.  That is the real value here for China, & the real threat for the US.
5330 2018-07-13 19:47:21 Coconut oil on my body
5331 2018-07-13 19:47:20 I did use my software. It just happened to be that way. But I will make sure that  my next pick will not be oil related.
5332 2018-07-13 19:47:11 Individuals who own earth's oil resources

That's a good one
5333 2018-07-13 19:47:06 Rip to this yellow Tommy shirt I only got wear once before I ruined it.. cheese empanada grease be taking lives... If u know how to take oil stains out hit my DM
5334 2018-07-13 19:47:01 Several years too late ! The division of SS was a mistake but supported by powers who knew they can manipulate leaders there to get cheap oil- the price was people’s lives
5335 2018-07-13 19:46:50 I had some kind of dry skin ear thing and the doctor gave me these oil drops. I couldn't use them more than twice.

Now that I think of it the ear thing stopped eventually. I don't know why.
5336 2018-07-13 19:46:46 Career prospects for Paleoclimatologist in 1990:
"If my findings support #AGW, my field can start a worldwide movement and take down big oil!
"If not, best prospect is a string of adjunct positions in a tiny field that no one cares about."

Which do you think they "discovered"?
5337 2018-07-13 19:46:45 u know how people walk around and reek of pot, thats me but with fried oil
5338 2018-07-13 19:46:39 Trump now says he might release US Oil Reserves to get price lower... not a case of emergency use for our reserves....it’s politics only! Somebody needs to stop this man from using our needed reserves otherwise when we really need them they won’t be there!
5339 2018-07-13 19:46:34 And democratic’s solution is to raise taxes and kill businesses.
Climate change, gun control, oil drilling, algae blooms, free healthcare for all, education reform according to your Twitter you can solve it all
5340 2018-07-13 19:46:22 Olive oil maybe?
5341 2018-07-13 19:46:01 “ESP Obama and Clinton” lol you don’t think Bush had his oil interests or Chaney’s interests in Halliburton in mind when we went to war in the Middle East? Lol come on Susan, you can’t be serious.
5342 2018-07-13 19:45:55 Hello Mtr Toddy its me Joss! I just discovered rich tea biscuits when I got to Palm Oil Campaign HQ very hungry! Do take some I'm learning about dunking!! #orangutanfriendly

5344 2018-07-13 19:45:52 Lolololol. My air filter is always. Dirty. Never been a time it didn't need to be replaced according to an oil change place. I swear they just keep a dirty air filter hidden and then take it out and pretend like it came from your car.
5345 2018-07-13 19:45:52 It’s me oil of olay morning routine dat keeps me looking so young but look closer, the signs are there 
5346 2018-07-13 19:45:49 To the contrary, the US cited gold for oil trade as part of the way Iran was able to break US sanctions.  The US State Dept mentioned gold 2x in the call on new Iran Sanctions...suggests its rather robust rather than an anachronism, no?
5347 2018-07-13 19:45:45 Upup
5348 2018-07-13 19:45:40 as long as the fry oil is fresh and they are cooked crispy, I'll take the Smileys over tater tots.

5351 2018-07-13 19:45:11 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

5354 2018-07-13 19:44:54 That too-
5355 2018-07-13 19:44:31 The far right is unified behind the real and the fake fear of terrorism and are willing to throw democracy under the bus to achieve their worldview as well as make a profit from Russian oil and gas futures while they burn liberty. @MalcolmNance
5356 2018-07-13 19:44:30 CBD Oil?
5357 2018-07-13 19:44:17 only if there is baby oil involved
5358 2018-07-13 19:44:16 1)Define a cuánto estimas que baja, no es lo mismo el wti a 20 que a 65 usd; y 2)la demanda de Oil es alta en el mundo, yo creía lo contrario pero estoy viendo de forma real que aún faltan unos 50 años para al menos ver un mundo con paneles solares y 50% de EV. Soy fan de Tesla
5359 2018-07-13 19:44:02 My decent day of housework went to hell. Yes, I did drop a jar of sundried tomatoes in oil. And it shattered. 
5360 2018-07-13 19:43:55 Come getcha some oil 
5361 2018-07-13 19:43:51 Dinosaurs decomposing makes oil
Oil makes plastic
Plastic makes plastic dinosaurs
Plastic dinosaurs are made of real dinosaurs
5362 2018-07-13 19:43:40 Now bulls will try to make oil reserve release as something bullish #oott
5363 2018-07-13 19:43:38 We’re becoming the lead export of energy and oil. (Google it) That debt will be gone before your next head-explosion. But keep trying.
5364 2018-07-13 19:43:35 not necessarily an endorsement for the explorer, though we'e had no troubles with ours outside the normal, tires and oil change.

5370 2018-07-13 19:43:08 A bright side....tbh I have no idea why anyone would travel to an oil rich nation with 3rd world ideologies
5371 2018-07-13 19:43:07 Steady Corey, you started well then you got into the standard big oil insanity ranting then attached a document which did not quantify the human impact on climate change. 
So I say again... do try to be more accurate
5372 2018-07-13 19:43:05 its not as bad as it was a few days ago, I couldn't touch my arm.  I found Lavender helps a lot!  Just a small drop of the oil.
5373 2018-07-13 19:43:00 LOL. Trump bombs Syria who Putin supports, puts sanctions on Russia, enacts policy for US to b largest oil producer which hurts Russia, & got NATO to pay extra $34 bil which is bad for Russia. Anybody who pretends there’s collusion disqualifies themselves as a serious person.
5374 2018-07-13 19:42:59 Apply olive oil on your lashes. It will help them grow longer and stronger 
pure petroleum jelly will help your lashes grow faster 
soak lemon peels in olive oil for a few days then apply it to your lashes 
caster oil will also make your lashes grow!:)
5375 2018-07-13 19:42:49 
5376 2018-07-13 19:42:44 just paid $46 for an oil change in my moms jeep  there goes another paycheck
5377 2018-07-13 19:42:43 Russias economy is in shambles. trump is helping them by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal that had dropped the price for a barrel of oil.


5378 2018-07-13 19:42:25 Akothee's skin glows as of she immerses herself in oil and comes out with all the oil
5379 2018-07-13 19:42:21 Maybe Trump should rejolin the Iran nuclear agreement thus helping oil prices drop.

5382 2018-07-13 19:41:34 It would be funny if Putin like, handed over the guys and said "Prove it". Because we all know that could not be done.
5383 2018-07-13 19:41:14 I had Oil's Well in part of a box set with... Thexder 1 & 2, I think? I don't remember, but I loved Oil's Well!
5384 2018-07-13 19:41:00 $DRQ interestingly positively diverging from Oil Services names last month+ , always see value in this one
5385 2018-07-13 19:40:58 The guy next to me is a cutie and we’re both getting our oil changed how romantic
5386 2018-07-13 19:40:53 Yes.

I prefer fries cooked in pure cooking oil, with no antifoam or antipolymer additives. 

Gonna get fries from my high school hangout Volcano Burgers today.
5387 2018-07-13 19:40:49 I HATE having to deal with a car. All that changing a tire, oil changes, putting gas and washing it. ITS ALL FOR THE BIRDS!!! 

And here I am getting an oil change.
5388 2018-07-13 19:40:46 @kelsey_feed Oh well, if you go in there, you should stop taking oil for your car dude cuz it’s coming from UK smashed Iraq’s death places.
Got that or still delay? Lol
5389 2018-07-13 19:40:31 Thats a classic modern football fan right there. People who weren’t born after 2000 would generally disagree. Oil money success, just buying all these world class players just gets a global fanbase, drives up ticket prices & destroys the soul of a club. Would rather earn a trophy

5396 2018-07-13 19:40:02 @OIivr_ oil mayt wyd
5397 2018-07-13 19:40:01 It may all be.  You’re right, since all media has lost its integrity we no longer know what is true.  The Pence story is bad.  In NC any company selling gas/oil tanks are responsible for the ins against leaks for 10 years, never had a client bankruptcy in this field though.
5398 2018-07-13 19:39:46 She actually thought she found an oil well not knowing that this Bross have plenty sense.
5399 2018-07-13 19:39:46 I buy your Norway-Oil-Lucky argument to some degree, but what about the other countries? They also enjoy high equality, low corruption, low crimes and have strong unions and governments. What's the magic?
5400 2018-07-13 19:39:45 I’m really natural  I don’t even put products in my hair like that. Oil and gel at the most
5401 2018-07-13 19:39:38 It may really back fire on the U.S. if Trump starts tapping into our own oil reserves.
5402 2018-07-13 19:39:37 So, I go in for a simple oil change and tire rotation with a discount coupon and now they're telling me my lug nuts are swollen and need replacing #carproblems #moneyproblems
5403 2018-07-13 19:39:25 overslept and went to work with coconut oil in my hair tgif
5404 2018-07-13 19:39:21 friday 13th: smashed glass jars of mayo and pickled onions on front stairs, the stench! soothing art time, oil pastel parrot, sketches of crabs, a giant (and free!) mirror for my new room, accidentally locking me and georgie out and resorting to matches of mastermind with wine.
5405 2018-07-13 19:39:06 Cooking tip: if you stir Coconut oil into your Kale it makes it easier to scrape it into the fucking bin.
5406 2018-07-13 19:38:57 Beard Oil
5407 2018-07-13 19:38:47 Bananas :) I also drink chamomile tea, use olive oil more often, and a heating pack for last resort
5408 2018-07-13 19:38:38 Pro tip: if you add coconut oil to your kale, it makes it easier to scrape into the trash.
5409 2018-07-13 19:38:36 But I guarantee you, he'll try and sell oil and mineral rights out from under the farmers that own them. And as taxes are concerned don't hold your breath. He supports trump and how many farmers are getting screwed by trump now? Don't try and argue if you don't own a farm.
5410 2018-07-13 19:38:34 G are you sure that applies to Nigeria, most oil companies in naija would pay interns around 50k
5411 2018-07-13 19:38:23 But boy what the f* would we do without that WaPo analysis huh
5412 2018-07-13 19:38:12 I stopped sippin oil that shit make me cranky
5413 2018-07-13 19:38:09 Pastor Francis, I never knew about the real oil being poured on sheep. Now I can have Holy Oil from my Heavenly Father to help me not get entangled. Thank you for sharing this with me. You are a precious Woman of God that I am very grateful to. I bless you, Deut 1:11!
5414 2018-07-13 19:38:04 Gold will likely continually b sold, oil/gold ratio will likely remain low until someone decides its no longer in their interest for that to occur.  Last 2x that happened as a ccy system went end-of-life it happened virtually overnite by political fiat (1933, 1971), caveat emptor
5415 2018-07-13 19:38:04 Try coconut oil
5416 2018-07-13 19:37:37 I just got a full synthetic oil change for $35!

5419 2018-07-13 19:37:27 Every time I take my 2002 Mazda Protege to get oil changed they give me a giant list of things I need to repair. The list is ever changing and always in the thousands. Had the car for a few years with no issues. The car is only worth a fraction of their repair estimates.

5423 2018-07-13 19:37:05 Your hypocrisy is too stunning for words. 
Two million marched against Blair's war for oil profits,but the war went ahead anyway.
I warn the marchers. Unless you are organised to overthrow the Tories via a GE, even 10 million on the streets would be ignored.

5428 2018-07-13 19:36:01 true, when you think about it, the oil refineries are concentrated in the south now, sunnis lost the baiji one, and the kurds are betting on retaking Kirkuk. A destruction to the refineries in the south will even things out or turn it into the 'others' favor.

5440 2018-07-13 19:34:52 I've been listening to what @ErikSTownsend & @cjenscook have said about them w/great interest, particularly vis a vis geopolitical developments, timing of CNY oil contract 1st settlement month (Sep), etc.  Not fully sure what to make of it all yet, would love any thoughts u have
5441 2018-07-13 19:34:50 Obama played his part for 8 years destroying Africa to exploit their resourses by encouraging civil wars, infightings b/w tribes. Arms to all warring groups supplied by US in exchange for their oil or minerals or other resources.
5442 2018-07-13 19:34:48 Haha, really so trump forcing nato to pay up, calling attention to Germany giving Russia billions, literally killing Russians in the middle east, confronting Russian gas and oil market, while Obama literally sold Russia our uranium, how dumb r u

Prior to north sea oil your country was basicly a rocky outcrop with men pulling fish out of sea.

But it's great you have a good standard of living, enjoy it.
5448 2018-07-13 19:34:20 Oil producers from the Middle East buy US Govnt treasuries. It's known as "circular flow". Why should a poorer nation invest in the USA instead of investing in their own economies? Saudi Arabia has 1/2 the per cap GDP of the USA. Why are they saving in $US?
5449 2018-07-13 19:34:16 Feel like the Rock right now. This woman  got my slathered up in oil.
5450 2018-07-13 19:34:16 @ShepNewsTeam So if Trump is getting NATO Defense spending up isn’t that a subtle dig at Russia. Plus he hammered Germany over the oil they’re getting from Russia. The man gets results and knows what he’s doing.
5451 2018-07-13 19:34:13 New Yorker here, can confirm he does not.

5453 2018-07-13 19:34:04 U need to create more avenues to fund and sustain it. Not all the proceeds from oil goes to FSHS. Just a fraction
5454 2018-07-13 19:34:03 How do the royal family oil the wheels for conflicts in Syria and Yemen? Genuinely curious.
5455 2018-07-13 19:33:54 From my forthcoming book, Oil and God:
US’ control over Saudi & other ME oil exports is a non-lethal WMD against big oil importing rivals China, cont. EU, India, Japan...
O&G connects the complicated nexus of US politics, Saudi oil exports & Wahhabism.

5458 2018-07-13 19:33:41 It's time we demand the technologies that have been denied and classified from us (due to "national security issues") are publicized.

5460 2018-07-13 19:33:34 Illiterate people not even have knowledge about crude oil prices are decided by International exchanges like WTI, Brent, and Opec not by local refineries. I think you are one of the desperate guy to show your rotten brain on twitter.

5463 2018-07-13 19:33:17 The oil is in the ICEE
5464 2018-07-13 19:33:15 I recommend lavender oil and water in a spray bottle... it smells better than bug spray and it works really well
5465 2018-07-13 19:33:13 Yes, the value of oil is affected greatly by the labor required to extract, pipe and refine it...
5466 2018-07-13 19:33:06 I hear she feeds it caribou or moose tallow & meat, berries, seal oil and  sometimes fish. All whipped together with snow or water after cooking over an open fire. 
5467 2018-07-13 19:33:05 We clearly need to do this better; they have the system down. Make, corrupt, remove, repeat power cycle.
5468 2018-07-13 19:33:02 Could go either way. Nordic countries have a great history of federal govt investing in oil. Canada had.... PetroCan..  let's hope we don't do that again

5485 2018-07-13 19:30:46 What if you’re being boiled alive in burning oil? Or you’re a factory worker who dies after falling into a paint mixer?
5486 2018-07-13 19:30:43 I can already see the environmentally catastrophic oil spill that'll happen once they go for sea drilling in Lebanon. Unlike the garbage crisis though, it's not too colourful.
5487 2018-07-13 19:30:38 heaven only knows. Could be that creep Perry (Sec. Energy), who seems exceptionally underinformed on oil issues for someone from Texas.
5488 2018-07-13 19:30:25 Thought we were made to understand that oil money would be used to fund the f shs

5492 2018-07-13 19:30:16 Changed his oil at 5100 miles...

...even though the manufacturer's guidelines specifically recommend 5000.

5497 2018-07-13 19:29:20 $cei  if you just took some cash consider buying extra shares on the fall back  WEEK END and I THINK TRUMP IS GETTING SOFT WITH CHINA  COULD SNAP THAT OIL PRICE BACK UP FROM PREVIOUS DAYS  just guessing
5498 2018-07-13 19:29:14 I really should wash my car but every time I do something like that (wash the car, change the oil, fill the tank, etc) my damn car dies... so not really wanting that.

5502 2018-07-13 19:28:51 The US is stealing Iraqi oil?
5503 2018-07-13 19:28:45 It's supposed to be automatic, but now no one can really tell. Given Trump's pattern, it will be automatic. Same with Iranian oil exports - assumes big sanctions on China which will likely be introduced. Seems like sanctions policy has reached its logical destabilizing peak.
5504 2018-07-13 19:28:45 I was getting an oil change and Bill told me about it, he said that he thinks its cool what you do with your videos.
5505 2018-07-13 19:28:18 So 4 Trump tweets on the oil mkt, one call to the King (KSA), no Iran waivers, yes maybe some waivers, no waivers, no SPR (Perry), maybe SPR. Lunatics running the asylum. Destroy a proper price signal today...and risk long-term supply tomorrow  #OOTT

5511 2018-07-13 19:27:25 No he doesnt he opened national oceans, and parks for drilling pillaging all while laxed pipe laying practices are performed leading to ruptures pollution. That isnt even mentioning the massive pay checks oil/gas/ and coal are paying him to literally pollute and destroy our home
5512 2018-07-13 19:27:23 Well if that's true, then we need to have gas at about $0.75 a gallon. Stop exporting are oil and bringing in others.

5524 2018-07-13 19:25:13 The only thing using SPR crude (which is supposedly crappy, heavy oil) will do is replace some of the missing heavy gunk from Venezuela. That would be the one gap to fill. And that's still not what the SPR is for.

5545 2018-07-13 19:22:22 That’s a day and a half of US oil consumption .  Knee jerk reaction on prices lower for a day or two at best.
5546 2018-07-13 19:22:08 I have to go get my car washed and an oil change but I am way too lazy to get up.

5548 2018-07-13 19:21:44 Oil change tomorrow
5549 2018-07-13 19:21:39 Cxl? Confront him! Anyone pretending Trump is in cahoots w Russia is not a serious person. Trump bombs Syria who Putin supports, puts sanctions on Russia, enacts policies for US to b largest oil producer that hurts Russia, & got NATO to pay extra $34 bil which is bad for Russia.
5550 2018-07-13 19:21:31 Do you use oil to cook French toast?
5551 2018-07-13 19:21:25 This is great
5552 2018-07-13 19:21:23 2/2 - its nice yes - we've overtaken France but we r way behind in per capita - that's what matters  in the final analysis- our current rank is 137 & to catch up with China's rank of 80 we will have to grow at this rate for 30 years , keep population down , & discover OIL!!!!
5553 2018-07-13 19:21:15 You make the fries from scratch as well ? I would like to try that combo the fries and avocado. And I’m curious about the carrot chips. Do I just fry them in oil ? Idk how I feel about a Brussel Sprout chip simple because I’ve never had brussel sprouts that taste good.
5554 2018-07-13 19:21:10 Imagine Trump sanctions Nigeria the same way he sanctioned Iran?

Can Nigeria survive in a zero crude oil export sanction era?

Nigeria will implode within 6 months.
5555 2018-07-13 19:20:55 So much for this 10 minute oil change. 
5556 2018-07-13 19:20:51 ‘If Iran can't export oil no-one in Middle East will,’ Tehran warns
Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital artery for oil shipments from the Middle East. The warning comes in response to the US, which is trying to cut off Iranian crude exports.

5652 2018-07-13 19:10:47 The carbon tax was punishing polluters and rewarding the people who were environmentally conscious by making it easier to change their lifestyles and cutting the tether to the oil companies. That initiative WAS ALREADY "FOR THE PEOPLE"! Bad Douggy, bad!
5653 2018-07-13 19:10:39 It's not so much about the oil (" wti) as it is about who dictates the price..AKA.... G's,ms,citi,bac,jp AND a few big hedgies!!!.

5659 2018-07-13 19:10:12 Not quite sure it stands up there with, say, oil painting.

But note, a lot of the folks who get really hit aren't FOLLOWING those lost accounts, and I wasn't aware there was a lot of vetting of who you let follow you ... though certainly more in the Resistance than celebs

5667 2018-07-13 19:09:45 I can and will compare. That's the whole point. Though Norways immense pension funds come from oil, >4% of its interests (interests only!!) are used in state budget. Last year that ammounted to 17% of the total budget. This is hardly the only reason.

5674 2018-07-13 19:08:41 He always does. Late at night in a dark room. With some nice scented oil.
5675 2018-07-13 19:08:40 #JackMa is no longer the richest person in Asia. India's Mukesh Ambani toppled him with an oil fortune of $44.3 billion after a blazing stock rally.
5676 2018-07-13 19:08:33 Lmao, I'm sleep. Listen it's not always about palm oil & tomato paste. We might as well have a cook off  since I see you whipping it in the kitchen

3) i’ve been making art my entire life it’s.    weird because i don’t even think it’s that good
5679 2018-07-13 19:08:14 My skin is the Sahara Desert so oil helps a lot!!
5680 2018-07-13 19:08:03 @TheBlazeKeith will Glenn and Teeka be teaching us how to get into the Mormon money, the foreign money or the Texas oil money?
5681 2018-07-13 19:07:50 I only referring to the appearance. I will never again buy a oil fuelled car. I have a Tesla on order and will keep my current car until I can swap directly to the Tesla.
5682 2018-07-13 19:07:44 What’s the worst bike you’ve owned? I had a Suzuki X7 for half an hour but I took it back, GSXR1100 slab side with a monster oil leak through a cracked crankcase and my Honda MT5 (30mph 50) which was quicker if I got off and walked 
5683 2018-07-13 19:07:43 I would be happy to be a talented amateur. I’m making falafel from scratch at the weekend. Oil thermometer in my bag ready for wielding.
5684 2018-07-13 19:07:27 He’ll ask. 
But it’ll sound like the Tin Man before he got his oil.
5685 2018-07-13 19:07:16 Antalet aktiva olje- och gasriggar i USA ökade med 2 denna veckan till 1 054 (årsskiftet 929), enligt Baker Hughes #OOTT #oil
5686 2018-07-13 19:07:11 WTI & Brent oil trading chatroom update #OOTT : Started the day with a new person having a meltdown as WTI moved above $70.73, sarcastic anger at room's traders, "I'll never come back here", "stupid oil", etc.  Not much reaction from other posters who participated in rally.
5687 2018-07-13 19:07:09 Oil Shock Since Trump was inaugurated, gasoline prices have jumped sixty cents a gallon. That’s a $700 annual tax on every American household. Trump bears blame As does anyone who supports him.
5688 2018-07-13 19:06:57 According to the N.Y. Times, 40% of crude oil and 30% of coal.  That's significant.  Gettin' it done - Persist.
5689 2018-07-13 19:06:54 Haven’t tried the syrup. Love the oil
5690 2018-07-13 19:06:33 @jamesmartinchef Your American Adventures quote “It’s the best BBQ I’ve ever eaten” well you haven’t eaten mine!...  and have you tried Zephyros Natural premium olive oil? Just superb 
5691 2018-07-13 19:06:32 If you tolerate MCT powder/oil well, it is still a great way to hit your fat macros during the day, but it is not necessary to add to Kegenix PRIME to elongate the effects.
5692 2018-07-13 19:06:08 FYI: changed subject: something to look into. Per AP 6/13/18 Cleanup of Pence family gas stations cost taxpayers @ 20 million. 85 contaminated stations in 3 states.Toxic cleanup after collapse of oil business operated by his family.
5693 2018-07-13 19:06:02 let me just say okay
5694 2018-07-13 19:05:53 Were any snakes harmed when this oil was extracted from them?
5695 2018-07-13 19:05:40 I bet you were quite a sensible person before the oil money and Man City were a proper club. Or were you a Chelsea fan ?
5696 2018-07-13 19:05:11 Maybe u use it too much,spray a little ,especially the fruity
5697 2018-07-13 19:05:10 Hasn't this administration done enough favors for oil refiners?
5698 2018-07-13 19:05:07 Yes as soon as I wrote that I thought of oil & water in a bottle & shaken. Fab thanks, should really have thought of that myself.
5699 2018-07-13 19:04:35 no
er is that Suffolk in England?
I'll have a look there myself
(I said "cannabis oil" but it was more "oil from cannabis" like that rick simpson does rather than a hemp-like oil)
thanks
5700 2018-07-13 19:04:33 allison stole a bottle of olive oil
5701 2018-07-13 19:04:02 Slept good last night. Getting stuff done today. Decent day so far. Sitting in waiting room getting an oil change.

Random panic attack.

Thanks body.
5702 2018-07-13 19:03:52 Enjoy your weekend guys!
5703 2018-07-13 19:03:46 Like in paying nearly 4 billion US dollars to russia buying their oil?
5704 2018-07-13 19:03:45 What about those of us who were promised by Bo-Tock the snake oil salesman that we could keep our plans and our doctors and could not.  He LIED, just to get his Socialist Medicare Bill passed and you support it because it’s, well SOCIALIST!  There are more of me and you care not!
5705 2018-07-13 19:03:44 Or wheatland lucas oil... def. Has the facilities.... and dirt...
5706 2018-07-13 19:03:29 If you are up for spending a few dollars then I use Tarte tingle treatment, followed by Sunday Riley Luna oil and then a good spf 30 moisturiser. Can end up costing a bit but my skin has never looked better so it’s all worth it!  :)
5707 2018-07-13 19:03:29 & I like a man that’s like my daddy but they don’t know squat about changing oil, cutting grass, or changing a tire. Besides, knowing whether or not if I can cook won’t make a difference. I’m not cooking for a man that ain’t mine anyway. Probably wouldn’t even make it that far.
5708 2018-07-13 19:03:25 that is pretty impressive if you know the location from the trees and bushes.
Well done !! That solves that question then....but who is the man in the helmet reflection ?
5709 2018-07-13 19:03:23 I really need to chill on giving myself so much praise for little stuff like I’m literally sitting here thinking to myself how responsible I am for getting my oil changed on my lunch break
5710 2018-07-13 19:03:20 Když teď trochu nakukuju do #W40k, tak by se mi fakt hodilo, aby mi konečně poslali prachy za středeční demonstraci. Nebo zašlete model Venerable Dreadnought a wash nuln oil.

My tips are -  Wash face daily twice with hot water as it is very important factor that will dissolve all excess oil from skin. Another tip is make a paste with basen, honey, lemon juice and with milk. Apply  paste to your skin
5712 2018-07-13 19:03:16 Fucking cat knocked a bottle of avocado oil of the counter. I soaked up the oil. Washed with Dawn. Still finding glass. My dogs want to eat the glass. Not how I wanted to spend my day. Once the floor dries, will vacuum. Hopefully that will find all of the glass. Stupid cat.
5713 2018-07-13 19:03:11 You go to get your oil change and end up needing to do more 
5714 2018-07-13 19:03:08 Many cars have two reseteable trip meters. I use one for range (often more accurate than the gauge) the other for maintenance/oil.
5715 2018-07-13 19:03:04 $AMZN considering oil exploration $XOM $BP $CVX $RDSA drop 5% on the news
5716 2018-07-13 19:03:04 They are spending our common wealth and we are supposed to be 'great ful'? 
see how low we have gotten , an oil rich nation of 180million people is supposed to be 'great ful' for ambulance service? Choi Choi  SMH
5717 2018-07-13 19:02:55 And @BarackObama said to see how it plays out. I bet he and the oil company is laughing loudly.
5718 2018-07-13 19:02:51 Soon as I got off the lapalco bridge it's was a huge splash of water...took this opportunity to get my oil changed at Nissan
5719 2018-07-13 19:02:46 Name 1 thing Mueller has uncovered or a single indictment that could not have been obtained by normal investigative channels?
5720 2018-07-13 19:02:26 glad to see you’re finally being responsible. your lucky your car didn’t actually explode since you were too lazy to get your oil changed ya know since you were over 10,000 miles past due
5721 2018-07-13 19:02:14 Yes. Put a small amout of oil in to water and agitate/shake it it'll go foamy. It them seperates when it settles. It happens if your head gasket goes and water mixes with the engine oil. Foam gathers in the expansion tank and rocker/cam cover.
5722 2018-07-13 19:01:39 Both .... Cryptic Vegetable Oil reporting for duty 
5723 2018-07-13 19:01:28 I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a female employee at an oil change place...
5724 2018-07-13 19:01:22 Long term policy of US should be: 

- economic collapse of Russia (2.0), and;
- support attempts at democracy (2.0)

Oil. Energy.
5725 2018-07-13 19:01:06 Currently at crown getting that oil change. Forgot my charger in the car.
5726 2018-07-13 19:01:05 i literally just spend $500 dollars getting my breaks, batteries, tires and oil changed, didnt wanna help with any of that? gas money aint shit g
5727 2018-07-13 19:00:56 Fuck me your no oil painting twatchops
5728 2018-07-13 19:00:51 Boss: “so why are you late today?”
Me: “oh because I tossed a shirt into my hamper and it accidentally hit my wet oil painting. I had to spend 20 minutes tweezing out the dust and stray hairs” 


5729 2018-07-13 19:00:41 Noooo Just use your cooking oil 
5730 2018-07-13 19:00:37 Snake oil and rocks and PR.  I weep for our future.
5731 2018-07-13 19:00:35 Does anyone know anything about taking cbd oil? I’m interested in it for my migraines. Thoughts? Advice?

5734 2018-07-13 19:00:21 In addition to that, we’ve become an oil exporter, which would not have happened under the past regime or a new regime, if it weren’t us.  We have built up our military — $700 billion.  And then, next year, as you know, $716 billion.   WHAT REGIME ? at 31:50 minute mark
5735 2018-07-13 19:00:17 oil all the time he applied the eggs to his venerable locks,
5736 2018-07-13 19:00:14 From all I see Democrats were the most helpful wittingly or not. Republicans seemed, so far, to have better protections in place. 
Considering deals done under Obama, I still dont see why Russians would upset status quo. They got all they wanted under Obama
5737 2018-07-13 19:00:04 Well, to be fair, if those artifacts are all taken, then there won't be any need to protect the area and oil companies can drill

5739 2018-07-13 19:00:02 Sir very simple, Trump asked India to stop all the imports from Iran because they will use that money to target Nato troops in Iraq and Syria, according to you Muslims are terrorist, so by buying Oil from the Arabs don't you think, they can use Indian money to promote extremism.
5740 2018-07-13 19:00:01 Also it continues to piss me off that 3rd world dictators are welcomed warmly in the uk (as long as they give us oil etc) but trump is too far
5741 2018-07-13 19:00:01 “The more oil and natural gas New Mexico produces, and the more pipelines and transmission lines it has to move these resources safely, the more energy costs will decrease for cash-strapped families.”
5742 2018-07-13 18:59:55 If they have a backup that can challenge Talbot the oil might make the playoffs. Other than that they haven’t made any significant changes so I don’t think the team will be any better.
5743 2018-07-13 18:59:50 This is what happens when we allow the purveyors of snake oil or in this case magic water to sell their "alternate medicine" with no evidence of efficacy.
5744 2018-07-13 18:59:46 It's hard living in a state where oil & gas rule to be against fossil fuels, but here I am. We aren't alone, but sometimes it feels that way.
5745 2018-07-13 18:59:35 Heb je de Big Americain met Nozem Oil al getest?
5746 2018-07-13 18:59:34 
5747 2018-07-13 18:59:31 For my turn, I will spend four gold and allocate all three workers to *Oil!*. #CardsAgainstHumanity
5748 2018-07-13 18:59:29 The Devil will waste all your time just so you stay distracted and don’t go deeper in the tree of life. The anointing oil is produced from the literal tree of life, Jesus Christ in the garden.
5749 2018-07-13 18:59:07 Okay, sooooo I forgot my oil bag. HOW
5750 2018-07-13 18:59:07 From the same girl who drove her car with no oil
5751 2018-07-13 18:58:37 So, they were the good guys when Hillary sold our uranium and now, they're bad?  If they are bad, why did the Libs berate Trump for smacking Germany for buying their oil and gas?  You people are so confusing.
5752 2018-07-13 18:58:35 Thank you, David Suzuki, for naming the so-caled "grassroots" organizations we need to be suspicious of, e.g. Canada Action, Ethical Oil, Resource Works, International Climate Science Coalition (isn't that impressive, eh?), Friends of Science, Canadian Taxpayers Federation.
5753 2018-07-13 18:58:29 One time mid stroke this older women told me “this is a real oil change haha” and I just put my pants on and walked home
5754 2018-07-13 18:58:13 Here is a tip that no one may have thought of...STOP EXPORTING our oil!
5755 2018-07-13 18:57:59 Thank you for doing this oil video for me Korina. Was great to arrange it with you and you certainly did everything I wanted and asked for. Love u. Colin X

5757 2018-07-13 18:57:53 One of the few things I still enjoy about owning a BMW is that they’ll drive you to the movies while you get an oil change.
5758 2018-07-13 18:57:52 I'll oil up the guillotine
5759 2018-07-13 18:57:50 We got a pipeline going through our country and we don’t get oil or money we just got paid to help build it but not to keep it up
5760 2018-07-13 18:57:49 It's probably oil that's gathered on the road and not been washed away because of dry spell. Quick downpour and it'll mix and go milky or foamy.

5762 2018-07-13 18:57:37 Super dodgy guy but everytime I see him on British TV he wins. His pivot to his talking point on oil drilling was mastery of the dark arts. That format if interview allows no depth.
5763 2018-07-13 18:57:35 This sucks for everyone. But people have to realize that indigenous people are most significantly impacted and have been valiantly fighting this all along. Please wake up people of the world & support them. #KeepItInTheGround it’s always been about oil
5764 2018-07-13 18:57:34 I make cucumber pasta salad - orzo, English cucumbers, fresh mint and parsley, olive oil, lemon juice, S&P. I like to add feta if there's refrigeration.
5765 2018-07-13 18:57:26 Obviously not and that's probably a good thing
5766 2018-07-13 18:57:25 are you using the CBD oil ? or another form ?  glad it helps :) its so nice to be able to sleep a few hours . i don't sleep much. and i never feel refreshed. but had a change in my insomnia and i do get Delta stage REM ! yessss so good to dream even if it is sporadic and  seldom.
5767 2018-07-13 18:57:19 No....Uncle Stephen made a special one off appearance for me! He was changing his trousers cause of the hot weather.
5768 2018-07-13 18:57:19 Remember is was a rich Republican snake in the oil, who talked Cramer's wife to get Kevin to run for senate. Which included $$ support.
The $$$ made Kevin's eyes sparkle & now we have to #VoteCramerOut
5769 2018-07-13 18:57:13 The Cuban regime is a brother to the Chinese government. They also have a half-brother,North Korea,who has a small body and a fat head. I heard that Iran is also their distant relatives, whose stomach is full oil.
5770 2018-07-13 18:57:10 GASOLINE PRICES-HIGHEST GAS PRICES IN 2 YEARS- AMERICANS PAYING FOR OIL COS. RAISING GAS PRICES FOR SUPPORTING PRESIDENT TRUMP IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIOIN/ GAS COS. GAVE $250 MILLION TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN

5779 2018-07-13 18:55:58 Dozens of oil refineries in the south bay area too.
5780 2018-07-13 18:55:53 If the US/UK had not interfered in Persia in organising a coup against Iran’s democratic government and installing the Shah Persia would now be a capitalist country. The lust for oil corrupts everywhere including in your country
5781 2018-07-13 18:55:47 But then the paramedics called me saying she was high off cannibis oil
5782 2018-07-13 18:55:36 Socialism. They completely mismanaged the whole country, and also packed the oil industry with unemployed people, doubled the employees, and lowered production as a result. This is how socialism works. Everything suffers through horrible mismanagement.
5783 2018-07-13 18:55:29 Oil and water
5784 2018-07-13 18:55:23 it’s good man. add some flavored seasoning to it & make it a little spicy. it’s good with a well cooked burger. mayo has mad oil in it, it’s okay sometimes but too much is not healthy.
5785 2018-07-13 18:55:17 Who’s going reduce their oil to market to make room for it?
5786 2018-07-13 18:55:08 May be my cynical side but from tone on Congessional Candidate likely a dem. 
Gratuitous and hollow call for unity, pretty standard now.
Still dont see ANYTHING that couldn't have been investigated without Mueller.
5787 2018-07-13 18:55:07 It may be the same bottle used at BB and it's the same oil. Just it was pumped out 30 KM away at #HorseHill 
5788 2018-07-13 18:55:06 oh that sounds good. ive been meaning to infuse some oil with my anova lately...
5789 2018-07-13 18:55:04 Do you even mayor bro?
5790 2018-07-13 18:54:52 Nothing like a $100 oil change 
5791 2018-07-13 18:54:47 So many rabbits off in so many different directions. On Trump, for me he is exposing the deep state "Diplomatic" grip on intrntl relations whose in whose out. Who the USA is going to destroy for oil/resources. Trump has chucked it all up in the air. He wants a say right or wrong.
5792 2018-07-13 18:54:46 Rockaways are rocking. But your public housing is revolting.

5798 2018-07-13 18:53:56 yeah thats a question of options, i would not recommend oil from the street because of the additional chemicals in gas which often is used in manuf.
5799 2018-07-13 18:53:49 LYING TRUMP ACCUSED GERMANY OF BEING HELD CAPTIVE TO RUSSIA FOR OIL & NATURAL GAS PIPELINES-- YET TRUMP WANTS EXXON TO WIN A $500 BILLION OIL DEAL WITH RUSSIA--THE US WILL BE A TOTAL CAPTIVE TO RUSSIA & TRUMP WILL GET $80 BILLION SIGNING BONUS FROM RUSSIA---BIG CORRUPTION

5806 2018-07-13 18:52:46 Trump says everything still on track for NK. Meantime the sanction of 500,000 a yr oil stands now at 759,793. How much are we paying for the bodies?  How do we even know if they are “the bodies”?  “War Games” gone. Did @realDonaldTrump give away everything but the kitchen sink?
5807 2018-07-13 18:52:41 Nigeria is not developing ma'am, infact, life was better before. Things are getting out of hands here, the politicians are ever milking the country dry. The facts about oil is true, but what can we show for it? Poverty, crime and sort? We are fourth world here. That's the truth.

5809 2018-07-13 18:52:17 Oil light, fine fine I'll get around to it. Engine light a few weeks later, GAH fine I'll drop my car off on the way into work. Text messages, add a few more repairs and parts, fine gah. #CarRepairs
5810 2018-07-13 18:52:11 Little bit of oil and salt in the rice cooker. Add a lil adobo
5811 2018-07-13 18:51:39 Eye appointment on Tuesday. Was hoping I could do it tomorrow after the oil change but alas no openings
5812 2018-07-13 18:51:38 Con costa un Ostia la benzina da voi.....

5814 2018-07-13 18:51:35 I love my car and all but having to pay $2000 for an oil change and brake pads is fucking insane  Audi’s giving me the shaft today
5815 2018-07-13 18:51:34 #RT @yaeltygiel: @amycassandramtz I'm getting any oil change today too!!!
5816 2018-07-13 18:51:33 Full spectrum is pure CBD oil and .03% THC. We have a 500 mg bottle for $69 and 750 mg for $89. Hempworx is opening up to the UK again very soon. (Sorry for the delay. I didn’t receive the notification).
5817 2018-07-13 18:51:26 Where? Who? Where are all these great new jobs that pay with benefits? Who is getting the bigger paychecks if we can’t keep up with rising gas, health ins., heating oil prices? Where are your lower utility bills? Ours are higher? When will you realize your “Fake News” is a sham?

5820 2018-07-13 18:51:09 Says the genocidal war criminal in chief who lied to the american public about WMDs in order to justify the destabilisation of a sovereign state and give rise to the Islamic State just for oil. No, Bush will never have the moral highground. Especially not against Trump.
5821 2018-07-13 18:50:55 it lost 1 $ in 10 M ... thats why be care with Oil long 
5822 2018-07-13 18:50:51 That essential oil on the temples is the truth! Glad you like it 
5823 2018-07-13 18:50:42 Good thought. Never crossed my mind. But I did question the HUGE HALF PAGE AD in my local paper advertising hemp oil???
5824 2018-07-13 18:50:37 Got my oil changed. First time in my life the employees were all women. Thought that was a good sign of changes in culture.
5825 2018-07-13 18:50:28 No, no, GWB is literally Hitler, and a war-criminal that destabilized the Middle East in the name of oil $ and war profiteering remember?  And all based on a lie.
Fascinating to see the de-evolution of mainstream leftwing opinion.  So easily herded.  Just takes kind, gentle words
5826 2018-07-13 18:50:10 Looks more like a snake oil salesmen then a Deputy Director of the FBI. Oh that’s right. Human Resources for FBI.
5827 2018-07-13 18:50:06 This is just going to deplete the supply we have when this war breaks out this year.  Oil prices will continue to surge.

5829 2018-07-13 18:49:43 I have tried all kinds of methods to stop her from snoring. I put more pillows on to support her respiration, I told her to put on cajuput oil. BUT NAH SHE JUST SNORES LIKE MOOING COW. Damn u bronchitis y u make our lives miserable?!
5830 2018-07-13 18:49:39 $SPN Oil goes up this goes down....
5831 2018-07-13 18:49:36 And *cough* too intimidated to stay Catholic, according to my limited reading on the subject. Although I admit being brutally murdered for my faith as a martyr is not high on my to-do list. I am not worthy.
5832 2018-07-13 18:49:26 There are no shot cuts, we need to invest in oil storage and change our reliability to coal.. Theres no 3 weeks solution
5833 2018-07-13 18:49:09 @samriegel  was your oil throwing a reference to the motion picture Lorenzo’s Oil ?
5834 2018-07-13 18:49:09 oh!イル
5835 2018-07-13 18:49:08 Bio oil , olive oil and vapo rub are all good for getting rid of stretch marks
5836 2018-07-13 18:49:00 Nothing to see here. Just another Hollywood neoliberal tool acting as a useful idiot for the MIC, spreading anti-Russia CIA propaganda thereby furthering the agenda of the big oil execs and war profiteers.
5837 2018-07-13 18:48:36 When the money is used to build oil reserves, the construction takes a few years, maybe 2 to 5,the renewable energy sector will take time to kick in but it will
5838 2018-07-13 18:48:17 It's... really not that hard. Flour+seasoned salt, dip in egg, dip in flour mix, gently place in pre-heated oil in skillet (cast iron for best taste). Leave until desired doneness. Delicious.
5839 2018-07-13 18:48:11 Some said these days girls love cars alot as if they were breastfed on engine oil 
5840 2018-07-13 18:48:06 Why is CBD oil legal but weed isn't???
5841 2018-07-13 18:48:05 Fair enough, but I still believe that Trump is a snake oil salesman(and it's possible that he has broken a lot of emolument laws in doing so).
5842 2018-07-13 18:47:40 Getting my oil changed stresses me out way more than it should why am I nervous 
5843 2018-07-13 18:47:25 I meant the head of SS
5844 2018-07-13 18:46:42 I know how to change my oil too I’m just lazy as fuck 
5845 2018-07-13 18:46:40 Faka itissue oil bruv
5846 2018-07-13 18:46:36 Definitely Capri-Sonne! We've got to flush the oil from fried chips
5847 2018-07-13 18:46:26 Out here in Oregon we manage it by using strong beer, strong cider, and even stronger cannabis oil. Even then, I can usually only watch him for about a minute at a time before I start yelling at the television.
5848 2018-07-13 18:46:07 “When the oil burns me at work I moan but like just a little”
5849 2018-07-13 18:46:03 what on earth is "mentha" oil???
5850 2018-07-13 18:46:02 potstickers and vegetarian grilled cheese. . .14
okra-lobster chowder. . .6
lemon oil. . .25
seasonal lettuce-cod waffles. . .30
5851 2018-07-13 18:46:00 the funny thing is that the mkt may not come down at all! Actually the more they idiotically behave like this.... the more the oil price goes up.... MAO TZE TUNG once said: every nation deserve their own government.... Feel sorry for USA
5852 2018-07-13 18:45:56 Oil Baron Adam Page is Money $$$$
5853 2018-07-13 18:45:50 happy birthday to my girl Olive Oil!! @asap_olive
5854 2018-07-13 18:45:42 Have you been looking at the strange actions in the time spreads for oil futures and the price fluctuations them seem to conflict with fundamentals/indicate manipulation?
5855 2018-07-13 18:45:36 I fucking hot out here to be getting your oil changed I’m cooking in this mf and I ain’t even doing shit 
5856 2018-07-13 18:45:29 Got my car tuned up, oil changed and tires rotated ready to go to Atlanta again 
5857 2018-07-13 18:45:23 It is a sauce. Extremely hot hot sauce  ah sorry. It's olive oil infusion of a bunch of chillis and chillis' seeds  I think the boys would like it being Korean 
5858 2018-07-13 18:45:20 Why do you have such low expectations for HOBBS & SHAW: DAWN OF BABY OIL? Why? WHY?
5859 2018-07-13 18:45:19 Ah but they do create an impact that Russia can feel. Russia's biggest moneymaker is their oil titan ROSNEFT, and under these sanctions oil exports from were fucked with in such a particular way, that it has ended up hurting Rosneft profits by 30%. That's bot letting it happen.

5861 2018-07-13 18:45:00 how much y’all oil change be?
5862 2018-07-13 18:44:54 Russia is still interested in proceeding with a so-called oil-for-goods program, under which Moscow would help Iran sell its oil. In return, half of Iran’s oil revenue would be spent on Russian goods, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Friday.
5863 2018-07-13 18:44:43 Congrats Broooooo  .. and just  be careful with oil long for coming interval .
5864 2018-07-13 18:44:38 A negro can cook, Change her transmission, cover her daycare bill, read leather bound books, changer her oil and still gonna get soggy Alfredo and broccoli! Demand more kings 
5865 2018-07-13 18:44:24 Like POTUS answers to Pocahontas 
5866 2018-07-13 18:44:22 The pressure on Iran is mounting as Trump’s decision to withdraw from a 2015 deal that lifted most sanctions on Iran is forcing a number of international companies to reconsider ties with the Islamic republic, putting in jeopardy its giant oil and natural gas projects.
5867 2018-07-13 18:44:22 Oil change, and dress fitting
5868 2018-07-13 18:44:16 Ah, anything...just add salt and cooking oil. And if it’s not nice, put tomato sauce..
5869 2018-07-13 18:44:00 We are at Pearson Family Dentistry on Oil Well Rd. (next to car wash and 1st TN bank) today and tomorrow.
5870 2018-07-13 18:43:56 honestly my greatest accomplishment as a feminist was when I worked at a dunkin donuts drive thru at a gas station and a customer made a joke about a sugary drink being girly so I asked him (deadpan, over the intercom) if he wanted motor oil in it
5871 2018-07-13 18:43:55 Anderson just broke Isner! Finally we will see Djokovic vs Nadal.
5872 2018-07-13 18:43:55 wears my lab goggles while making bacon ever since that one time a spat of oil exploded and hit my eye 
5873 2018-07-13 18:43:51 Somebody posted a clip of him from his last movie, pretending to go into an archive. It was hilarious. 

A big door with an "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY" sign, and inside lush furnishings and him standing there, holding a framed oil painting for some reason.

5876 2018-07-13 18:43:26 Oil rose from $26 to $75. No inflation.
5877 2018-07-13 18:43:20 Iran said Russia is ready to invest as much as $50 billion in its oil industry even as Western majors are pulling out of deals with the republic amid the threat of U.S. sanctions.
5878 2018-07-13 18:43:18 My car is over heating and leaking fluids. It’s need a new alignment, brakes, an oil change. The odometer and speedometer don’t work and the latch to open the hood is gone. Do I just take the plates off n bounce or
5879 2018-07-13 18:43:04 It is used as part of maintenance efforts to drain oil. (AP)
5880 2018-07-13 18:42:57 So the UK should 'sever it's ties to the UK Renewable Energy Strategy'?
Which is a UK strategy.
Regardless of whether that's a good idea, (or just what the oil companies want) what in the name of Jebus does that have to do with the EU?
5881 2018-07-13 18:42:55 what oil company pays it's interns 250k?
5882 2018-07-13 18:42:46 "Hey baby, wanna see my coocnut oil collection? Really lubes up the scrotum."
5883 2018-07-13 18:42:46 Yes. Let's talk about Norway. Just came from there week before last. EXTREME prices. As in a meal that would cost MAYBE $30 here was $50. $50! And I did not even have to pay their income taxes. Cannot even imagine what costs would be without the oil.
5884 2018-07-13 18:42:43 Oil
5885 2018-07-13 18:42:41 What a joke.Let it go!!The Haggus Clinton lost cause peeps knew she was crooked and dishonest!Once they delve into the S Rich murder,we will find out he sent emails to wikileaks
5886 2018-07-13 18:42:33 Dear Big Oil CEO's  - you are quiet wrong. 
It will make very many people happy to see your companies sued into bankruptcy!
5887 2018-07-13 18:42:32 In regards to AC compressor making a noise, I wonder if that added oil to it prior to filling with Freon.

5893 2018-07-13 18:42:19 I love the song "Paris" or "coconut oil" or "fitness"

And all the videos
5894 2018-07-13 18:42:17 Pues si sube el gas oil y todo lo demas la subida de lss pensiones no servira de nada, mejor no haber sabido impuestos
5895 2018-07-13 18:42:01 It's the rain interacting with the oil in tarmac, air and other chemicals present. The oil is drawn up due to the heat, so when it rains you'll get this reaction and it looks like foam.
5896 2018-07-13 18:41:55 Used a spray “body lotion” for the first time and next time please put OIL larger cause I’m fucking glowing oh my gosh this is a disaster I need to shower again

5900 2018-07-13 18:41:39 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5901 2018-07-13 18:41:29 Oh dear God - added stress and expense when you definitely don’t need it. The cannabis oil needs a proper licence too. Xx
5902 2018-07-13 18:41:19 Ah, anything...just add salt and cooking oil. And if it’s not nice, put tomato sauce
5903 2018-07-13 18:41:12 The best part of #GoodwoodFestivalOfSpeed was completely stationary. Really enjoyed the Oil Paintings in the house. In particular the 2 square format #Canaletto and several A Van Dyke portraits. And nearly forgot the Charles 1 family group portrait which providence is Versailles
5904 2018-07-13 18:40:59 she said sorry for almost hurting me and tried to make me something that always made her happy....

though now the counters are charred and theres this oil looking stuff all over the place except its solid?
5905 2018-07-13 18:40:54 Yes Jon and wihout the oil money but own money. 
5906 2018-07-13 18:40:48 Aside from fears over the new Libyan-backed African currency, Blumenthal's sources reported to Clinton that Sarkozy was motivated by four primary concerns: Libyan oil, an opportunity to increase French influence in Northern Africa,... etc... etc... etc...
5907 2018-07-13 18:40:41 checked out the site and wow that is some expensive snake oil..

5913 2018-07-13 18:40:04 Wtf are you talking about? We’re not...yeah we’re (aka) USA...not going after anybody’s oil.  Just nonsense.  No point having discussions with you
5914 2018-07-13 18:40:00 I’m curious Who on my friends list hasn’t tried CBD oil? And why?
5915 2018-07-13 18:39:51 Omg bless your heart  um so there’s genetics, drinking water and I use tea tree oil
5916 2018-07-13 18:39:37 And there’s zero allergen in peanut oil made in North America. Not that it matters to the central argument, but people still need to be called on their willful ignorance.
5917 2018-07-13 18:39:37 Odd indeed although I suppose there is no milk, egg or oil like most muffin recipes. Sure they will be lovely and will rather selfishly keep all 4 for myself.  Often take a muffin to work for breakfast and can't resist recipes involving brown bananas.
5918 2018-07-13 18:39:30 when Mr. Drumpf talks the 'truth', a sad wolf dreams about being a #Democrat
5919 2018-07-13 18:39:27 wow oil still falling $USO
5920 2018-07-13 18:39:21 Pre-1993 and Gingrich's Contract on America. Not the same. Bushes & bin-Ladens were close oil buddies. Dubya flew the bin-Ladens out of the U.S. while all commercial planes were grounded. Reagan traded arms for hostages, ran illegal wars and funded death squads. Imagine that.
5921 2018-07-13 18:39:19 So #Trump tells #Merkel to stop #Russia's oil revenue by dropping the duplicitous contract that Merkel signed with Russia for oil and somehow it's Putin we need to worry about??? Maybe you need to go back and reread earlier stories.
5922 2018-07-13 18:39:15 We didn't forget. We don't like them. 

I'll never understand this argument. Call it what you want to, its destruction is based on socialism. They nationalized oil, ag, power, etc and now you have unemployement over 25%, inflation at crazy heights and riots everyday. Oh, wait..

5926 2018-07-13 18:38:49 They are steam engines that BURN material, explode it etc. this tech is laughable in a light of what we achieved in 2018 as a species. The only reason we have that overly complicated dirty and inferior tech is oil companies dedication to milking people.
5927 2018-07-13 18:38:48 Then oil up his printing press. BTW, LOVE you as Lex Luthor on Justice League  Action. I mean, who better to voice the smartest person in the DC Universe than the smartest person in OUR universe?
5928 2018-07-13 18:38:29 My oil change supposed to be $140 I get it for $25..shit is a blessing to be respected 
5929 2018-07-13 18:38:23 Shave, exfoliate, then moisturize/oil down. Mm, I feel plush.
5930 2018-07-13 18:37:43 It is sad that the topic of Climate Change was not included, technological advanced nations, UK, EU and USA should begin to ban the oil and gas industry and be replaced by clean energy technology.  This is urgent if we want to keep life on Earth.
5931 2018-07-13 18:37:39 I hear hot oil. Food must have touch heat now
5932 2018-07-13 18:37:24 He also brought down Anderson Accounting, convictions overturned. He is Deep State operating behind the mask of patriotism
5933 2018-07-13 18:37:18 The Gradua is the really interesting one. If you sot the ‘barred’ transfer on the oil tank, it’s a cheeky reference to the ban!

5937 2018-07-13 18:36:34 Just rename them the oil straws. Then they will be banned too
5938 2018-07-13 18:36:04 $100 for a oil change 
5939 2018-07-13 18:36:03 jojoba oil is great
5940 2018-07-13 18:36:01 Think they try to prevent oil spill by fucking the whole thing up...
5941 2018-07-13 18:36:01 I’ve been using Castor Oil Moisturizer by @BronnerBros (pink&white bottle) for 23 years..  mind you I turn 27 in a few days. 

Quality. 
5942 2018-07-13 18:35:56 Rice bran naturally had oil in it and we water cook it  like regular rice unlike the oil exacted from same bran by heating process which makes trans fats &later we again use for deep fries so easy trasfats here..
5943 2018-07-13 18:35:39 The acting is so bad and the girl who looks like Olive Oil gets all the good looking fella's wanting her but she is a snooze a minute
5944 2018-07-13 18:35:38 Suspect some of this is to do with higher price of oil, budget breakeven levels for some oil exporters being exceeded at current prices
5945 2018-07-13 18:35:37 Donald Trump’s visit to Britain does not “shame” Theresa May or their Queen. Like Trump, Britain’s PM has overseen war on Syria and Yemen where millions have died. The royal family oil the wheels for Britain’s wars and arms dealing. Britain like the USA is imperialist and racist.

5949 2018-07-13 18:35:16 So we should believe the oil corporation front group because...oil companies have always looked out for the public??? Seriously???
Thanks for calling attention to the undeniable fact that Exxon should be banned from New York. No other conclusion possible from this industry attack
5950 2018-07-13 18:35:03 A few studies show that coconut oil may increase the number of calories you burn by as much as 5%.
5951 2018-07-13 18:34:55 That’s what you call a thundercunt. I pray for the day when the oil runs out for these Khaleeji twats they return to there shit tents.
5952 2018-07-13 18:34:43 $cei  DOES OIL EVER TAKE THE WEEK END OFF ?  whatcha think SHORTY
5953 2018-07-13 18:34:41 so i use black soap, witch hazel and aloe vera gel then i use vitamin c serum, rosehip oil, vitamin e oil and tea tree oil. i also do an aloe vera face mask twice everyday (look on yt) and rose water as well. but i think it just takes time yk and i have seen improvements.

5957 2018-07-13 18:33:57 For years I've wanted nuge to be used as an offensive force rather than a 3rd line checking center. The oil imo have finally shored up parts of the roster where that should be the case this year. Nuge should be huge this season and I am here for it. #oilers

5960 2018-07-13 18:33:31 It did fine during the months we didn’t need the A/C. As soon as it got hot again we started having issues. All the work was done by the Ford dealership & everytime we picked it up there was a problem. Once they didn’t tighten the oil plug & the oils leaked out overnight!!
5961 2018-07-13 18:33:27 Developed technology that no other player had to extract, refine, transport heavy oil. It was state owned. Run by venezuelans, build by venezuelans. A much better example of development than any other OPEC member
5962 2018-07-13 18:33:26 I’ve got a few small cap stocks that I’m sitting on for the last couple of years. Oil, mining and agriculture tech. Not getting into too much on the side. So volatile right now across the board.

5965 2018-07-13 18:33:01 Gill a quick look at your posts indicates you're a shill for oil companies. You're going to need to cite your sources to have any kind of credibility at all.

5968 2018-07-13 18:32:48 Agreed - I think of productivity long-term.  We're not trying to maximize for short-term productivity which destroys the engine/person.  Maximizing long-term requires vacations and oil checks and running at the right speed.

5972 2018-07-13 18:32:22 Yeah good point. I want viveiros running the powerplay. Full stop. If they give him that responsibility I think the oil are gonna rebound hard. It should be awesome.

5974 2018-07-13 18:31:59 Time to start shilling cbd oil? Maybe. The job ad format was formatted a little sketchy but it's a product that moves itself....
5975 2018-07-13 18:31:55 PDVSA was the 5th largest producer of oil (very bad and cheap oil) but the 2nd largest oil corporation, second only to the giant merge ExxonMobil, that jump from 2nd to 5th was technology, services...aggregated value. It was efficient and left a lot of revenue

5977 2018-07-13 18:31:40 Democrats under Obama the most friendly to Russians defending them at every turn. 
Why would they favor R's ? Like most things claimed by Dimms this is 180 degrees from the truth.
5978 2018-07-13 18:31:34 Given the models which track USD liquidity the oil/gold ratio will remain low as gold is continually sold . One learns trading the derivative of fundamentals leads to ruin

5988 2018-07-13 18:30:35 2) The Oil deal worth up to $9 trillion in revenue was between Putin & Rex Tillerson at Exxon Mobil. We already have a circumstantial case of quid-pro-quo because Trump received the dirt & then appointed Tillerson to try to unblock the oil deal & the money frozen in Western banks

5994 2018-07-13 18:29:42 That is not a problem that can be controlled by immigration. We (and the rest of the Western World) need to look at the root causes and tackle them. Stopping invading their countries for oil and helping them in real terms to get water, education, medication etc would help a lot.
5995 2018-07-13 18:29:35 صدّق أو لا تصدق أن كندا أصبحت الآن أكبر خامس دولة في العالم (بعد المملكة، وروسيا، وامريكا، والصين) منتجة للبترول. وجه الغرابة هو أن البترول الذي تنتجه كندا يسمى: Dirty Oil (البترول القذر) هذا هو المصطلح الذي اتفق أنصار البيئة اطلاقه على بترول الرمال الكندية في مؤلفاتهم وأفلامهم .

6067 2018-07-13 18:21:52 You've got that the wrong way round petal. England is dependant on the celtic nations, they take oil from Scotland and water and power from Wales. Without us, they'd be screwed.

6070 2018-07-13 18:21:25 It is funny how the truth always sets off libs. Russian oil controls a lot of the EU. Germany wants Russia's pipeline.

6074 2018-07-13 18:21:10 Pretty bad lack of awareness/circumstance in this quote. He’s not wrong. But the narrative needs to continue to offer nothing but praise and joy for being at Lucas Oil when the alternative is Carroll Stadium. Everyone knows they can’t play their forever. 1/
6075 2018-07-13 18:21:08 They always do........
6076 2018-07-13 18:21:06 Yes. The value of oil comes from labor. Its natural state is not in a barrel

You can't sell that snake oil, about being the example of honesty & integrity, while you are cheating on your wife... Cheating = Lying!
6087 2018-07-13 18:19:41 Trump Admin. Said Considering Tapping U.S. Emergency Oil Reserve
No decision has been made yet on the issue, according to the sources
Options being considered range from a 5-million-barrel test sale to a larger release of 30 million barrels

6089 2018-07-13 18:19:16 The main commodities re: oil, natural gas, autos, etc. that the EU has major investments in on the global markets. With GER & the UK being the 2 major players that keep the Euro worth anything at all they control the value really.
6090 2018-07-13 18:19:14 I am really surprised that even after refrigeration the so called cheese of yours is still a viscous liquid and is tangy in taste, it looks more like an oil based spread rather than mozzarella cheese , as advertised by you.
6091 2018-07-13 18:19:11 Qatar 2022 will be the shittiest world cup ever bc its not in the summer . This an example of oil money destroying the beautiful game.
6092 2018-07-13 18:19:04 I wonder how many megatons of carbon Jane Fonda's opposition to nuclear power put into the atmosphere, through construction of coal & oil plants instead of nuclear? And how many generations will deal with the results?

6094 2018-07-13 18:18:59 heb me benen ingesmeerd met body oil lopen is passé ik glibber nu over de vloer terwijl ik een verdervende eucalyptusgeur achterlaat op de overloop
6095 2018-07-13 18:18:57 To everyone reading the news about the US maybe tapping the SPR, just  to make you aware, the quality of that crude oil is pretty close to asphalt at this point.  Virtually every refiner wouldn't accept it  anyway
6096 2018-07-13 18:18:54 I forgot I pay extra monthly for my high jack for my car so I get free oil changes lol

6098 2018-07-13 18:18:31 Thank-you from Michigan, the Great Lakes state that Trump is promoting corporate oil drilling in!
6099 2018-07-13 18:18:27 What would happen to OPEC is the US stopped buying their oil?

6101 2018-07-13 18:18:17 (Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is actively
considering tapping into the nation’s emergency supply of crude
oil as political pressure grows to rein in rising gasoline
prices before the mid-term congressional elections, two people
familiar with the situation told Bloomberg
6102 2018-07-13 18:18:13 As 100s of billions in oil wealth flowed south this was the reality in our biggest city.

6104 2018-07-13 18:17:59 This is wonderful..! If Nigeria can strive harder and get up to 50% of its total Revenue from non oil sources, that may well be the finest achievement of this Govt. This is unprecedented and quite impressive.
6105 2018-07-13 18:17:55 we really didn't need that SPR oil reserve rumor just now. XOM took a quick dive. damn how long are we gonna screw around the 25K level. :'( :'(

6107 2018-07-13 18:17:50 /rlt/ sunflower oil nya kleveru bisa dijadiin cleansing oil ga?
6108 2018-07-13 18:17:46 The oil/gass reserve-argument is true for Norway, but not Sweden or Denmark. And what about size?!? So  what? Is smaller your success formula?
6109 2018-07-13 18:17:45 I know this is a stupid and trivial thing to bring up today, but the @jonlovett rant about truffle oil is still making me laugh because it’s so fucking true. #truffleoilisdisgusting #lovettorleaveit

6116 2018-07-13 18:16:54 How much Oil / Energy Is USA importing from Russia?Check official numbers from bureau of census. You never talk about this and about the trade deficit with Russia. Why? Maybe Putin does not like that. Make your homework first before you start blaming and insulting other Nations.
6117 2018-07-13 18:16:48 Never said they didn’t reduce emissions. I said that they need oil, they are extremely expensive and don’t come near to make that money back. they are extremely unreliable. I said put that money into research for technology that will eventually work. What part dont u understand?
6118 2018-07-13 18:16:33 I went to pick my car up after getting the oil changed. The old man said not to worry about it & to pay him little by little when I can. Got in my car & my tank was full! So here I am crying my ass back home.

6128 2018-07-13 18:15:44 This is 100% true. Though, I remember a reddit post from forever ago that said if you spray them with cooking oil and reheat in a hot skillet or 400-450 degree oven, they turn out a lot better.

6134 2018-07-13 18:15:33 My father worked in civil and mining engineering (including dam stability). I worked in oil and gas. Engineering projects are usually over time/budget for exactly the same reason as software projects: Uncertainty and incomplete knowledge of the conditions on the ground.
6135 2018-07-13 18:15:29 Feeling like a dude from the 1920's cause I smell like motor oil and tobacco.
6136 2018-07-13 18:15:27 In order to improve relations with the world's other oil haver, Saudi Arabia, I suggest that President Trump formally pardon all 9/11 hijackers!
6137 2018-07-13 18:15:25 This isn't some academic exercise. It's not a hard question. And blaming your pals at other companies isn't an answer. You give a platform to lunatic conspiracy theorists whose mission is to terrorize tragedy victims to sell snake oil. That will be your legacy.
6138 2018-07-13 18:15:06 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
6139 2018-07-13 18:14:44 100% That it's obvious he's a snake oil salesmen makes it worse. We have fucked voter registration and ID laws here as well which are squarely aimed at keeping African Americans from voting. Alabama is not far away from how it was when my parents were kids & segregation was law.
6140 2018-07-13 18:14:44 Depending on the recipe, it can sometimes work to freeze olive oil, then use right away. Otherwise, are there any vegan suppliers that ship to your area?
6141 2018-07-13 18:14:42 Add a few drops of tissue oil when bathing preferably one rich in sweet almond and primrose oils. You can get it at Clicks. It helps with moisture
6142 2018-07-13 18:14:32 Every time I take my car in for an oil change, it feels like I won the lottery when they call me back and there isn’t a “hey we found this...” to start the convo.
6143 2018-07-13 18:14:22 How is the olive oil not located directly next to the vinegar in this Wegmans? Unacceptable layout.
6144 2018-07-13 18:14:04 We are mostly exporting light, high grade oil while trying to get as much heavy crude oil as possible for our refineries. The collapse of imports from VZ is driving prices higher.
6145 2018-07-13 18:13:58 Lol! Who controls gasoline prices? How much do governments tax them? I produce my own electricity at home. No one controls the price for me. That’s just not possible with gasoline - you must always pay the big oil corps just what they want.
6146 2018-07-13 18:13:52 Damn, I missed it. I wanted to ask him what he thought about those friday nights when his owner rubs sardine oil on parts of his body. Wonder what his thoughts are on that.
6147 2018-07-13 18:13:45 I’ve been cooking with Avocado oil and I don’t think there’s any turning back at this point 
6148 2018-07-13 18:13:45 I’ll cook for you but ask me to change my own oil and I’ll have an existential crisis.
6149 2018-07-13 18:13:44 Yes. it is correct. But should think about business and environment simultaneously.

6155 2018-07-13 18:13:07 @Valeo_Group bought a a/c compressor via WorldPac. Nothing in the documentation about whether it comes with oil in it. Techs need to know this. Denso does it. Don't make me dig around on the internet for this stuff.

6160 2018-07-13 18:12:15 s where does the fat come from? None of the other natural plant fats can scale up to replace the fat the world gets from dairy let alone from animal meat consumption.  (theoretically palm oil could scale up to replace just dairy fat but I’m sure you know the problems there)
6161 2018-07-13 18:12:10 I had to take my car to get my oil changed by myself and about 4 questions in I started answering “I don’t really know. I don’t know adult things.”
6162 2018-07-13 18:11:59 Crude oil is not petrol. We import alot of the fuel we consume.
6163 2018-07-13 18:11:56 
6164 2018-07-13 18:11:47 And I say America resolves the China problem by sanctioning all food and oil purchases from America and all allies till they learn what free trade is or die of from famine.
6165 2018-07-13 18:11:42 Oil. It’s about oil and the price of it. Trump and Putin are gunning for a war in Middle East. Hence the break up of relationships in NATO. Quid Pro Quo.

6357 2018-07-13 17:51:54 That's because they want honesty and transparency.  They don't want a candidate who says one thing to the public but another to Wall Street, big Pharma, big oil, and billionaires like the Koch brothers.  Establishment Democrats are speak with forked tongues.
6358 2018-07-13 17:51:46 If you soak them in sufficiently caustic diesel oil, you can light genres on fire. Then sprinkle with Parmesan and serve with clotted cream.

6366 2018-07-13 17:50:44 Give this consideration.  The US has been paying 70% of NATO defense. There are 28 other countries that pay about 30%.  Germany then buys 70% of its oil and gas from Russia, the country we are protecting the 28 other countries from.
6367 2018-07-13 17:50:35 Please which oil
6368 2018-07-13 17:50:35 While the regime has its negatives it has also worked for the poorer voiceless section of their society . Inequality was at its highest during the shahsregime

6373 2018-07-13 17:50:00 Coconut oil is actually bad to use as lube because it can increase yeast infection chance as well.
6374 2018-07-13 17:49:49 I know it says it’ll help my texture face, so I’m hoping! I’ve been trying to find a face oil at Walmart but I couldn’t find any
6375 2018-07-13 17:49:49 Yeah, it's just the 1.6 vvti petrol model. My van is diesel, great fuel economy and pulling power, but so expensive to fix oil burners!

6386 2018-07-13 17:48:36 So I also employ a gold/oil ratio (more accurately an oil/gold ratio) combined with inventory.  Rising Oil/gold is mostly explained by falling global inventory levels.  Agree with Hanke still too low given current trajectory of inventories and limited excess capacity.

6397 2018-07-13 17:47:43 @funko_fanpage what do you think about a funko pop set of former Trump cabinet members? Example: Rex Tillerson with a barrel of ExxonMobil oil.

6399 2018-07-13 17:47:39 PM Abadi and OIl Min Luaibi said they were looking to create jobs for Basra Oil industry is not labor intensive and will never create that much employment Protesters refused to meet with an Abadi delegation saying it was meaningless
6400 2018-07-13 17:47:37 Man, I need to learn to change the oil in my car myself. The prices are just getting ridiculous.
6401 2018-07-13 17:47:34 And no oil changes or engine repairs... have I convinced you to switch to EV yet?
6402 2018-07-13 17:47:29 Tips: apply u castor oil and petroleum jelly both mo ilalagay yun pero bago mo lagay dapat clean yung face mo then ibabad mo overnight. Every night mo gawin para mabilis kakapal.
6403 2018-07-13 17:47:26 There are lots with money that oppose him as well but the ones that control the media are protected from competition by the government. Also anyone in energy sector hates him as well. Canada has huge oil reserves and he has done much damage to the industry
6404 2018-07-13 17:47:20 Was reminded of the 1976 Chevy Monte Carlo I owned in the late 80s. It was the only car I had to put 6 quarts of oil into just to get it to the junkyard.
6405 2018-07-13 17:47:19 The unit of acct is inferred thru structure of gold mkt & what would happen in such a case.  Gold's price is set by 100+ paper oz for every phys oz.  If only phys oz is good for 100 bbls of oil, then there will be a run on phys gold & either USD gold or oil mkts will "break".
6406 2018-07-13 17:47:16 yeah I don’t use commercial either. my routine is cerave cleanser, fresh moisturizer, mario badescu buffering lotion (a godsend for my cystic acne spot treatment), and that’s it. 

tried witch hazel toner and it didn’t work. tea tree oil also didn’t work for me 
6407 2018-07-13 17:47:07 Oil coming out of ketchup bottle first is a literal physical representation of Satan walking the earth.
6408 2018-07-13 17:47:05 Thanks!  
6409 2018-07-13 17:46:58 If you can put a napkin on your food and it come out drenched from the oil

Maybe there’s a little too much oil?
6410 2018-07-13 17:46:47 Oh, come the fuck on, Walmart. It does NOT take this long to do an oil change. I was with a mechanic for 11 years I would know

6412 2018-07-13 17:46:33 Hahahaha nobody expects anything of the Saudi's they're allowed to continue to be terrible so long as they keep pumping oil out. However the country that invented the current relatively stable international order of norms and rules different matter.
6413 2018-07-13 17:46:33 Yes, it's an certified pure therapeutic grade essential oil!!
6414 2018-07-13 17:46:31 Putin is not fond of our President. Haven't you heard. He can't get anything from him & he can not intimidate him. He called  Germany for dealing with them for oil much like the French did with Iraq under Saddam. Oil money finances their imperialism to regain the Russian empire.
6415 2018-07-13 17:46:14 WTI, crude oil price pointing down toward 50$ , may be a deep change from the next week!

6423 2018-07-13 17:45:14 In the early stages of teenage dairy stuff,  food with a lot of oil(fat) and for girls a lot of makeup triggers even more acne and when they start trying taking them off with their hands not properly washed that's when it gets worse, so avoiding that does the trick

Please send thoughts and prayers
6429 2018-07-13 17:44:05 Yes they can in this case.  If 1-2 major oil exporters say physical gold is worth 100 bbls per oz, that is the new ratio which will govern mkts, assuming even a modicum of free movement of capital.

6434 2018-07-13 17:43:40 A mix of Crisco and WD-40 and coconut oil works wonders. And it’s good for the baby’s skin

6453 2018-07-13 17:41:59 If I may suggest. Wash the area that u will be applying the patch with a good non moisturizing soap. U want to take the oil out of your skin to make the patch stick & last longer. I even bought the little alcohol prep pads diabetics use to clean my skin to really get the oil off
6454 2018-07-13 17:41:57 For the sauce;
Wash and chop the onions and pepper into very tiny pieces. 
When the pepper &onions have medium smoothness, transfer to a bowl. Then add some palm oil till you get the consistency you want.

Just watch.

In about 5 years when millennials actually have money to invest in nice cars we're going to see a bunch of awful news about Tesla as the big oil companies realize we don't mess with them and they're losing their market.

6465 2018-07-13 17:40:57 Since Trump is Compromised, and he was set to promise reduced sanctions to get at that Exxon Russian oil, Mueller team has tied Trump’s hands! Putin doesn’t blame Trump & spares his life.

6491 2018-07-13 17:38:32 Just straight up drank a tablespoon of olive oil plain because the internet said so. Not the grossest thing I’ve done but it’s up there.
6492 2018-07-13 17:38:13 Does it itch? If so try mixing peppermint oil into an acv/water/conditioner mixed
6493 2018-07-13 17:38:10 Ripe / Unripe Plantain: as much as you can eat!
Fish: preferably Mackerel
Palm Oil

Habanero Pepper or any fresh chilli pepper
Salt (to taste)

6495 2018-07-13 17:38:07 Why did Arwan only get charged with bank fraud? Considering the scope of what the entire family did this is odd. A lot is being covered up. Why I dont know. But it is, by both sides.

6497 2018-07-13 17:37:47 Trena is right, better don't touch it. For oil painting I know the methods to restore/fix panel, I did it with the old methods, but acrylic can just be destroyed :-(
Yo can try an acrylic varnish on a small part of painting, I think...

6503 2018-07-13 17:36:30 Jesus. I just spit soda all over my keyboard when I saw this. Then did it again when I read his handle is "Peter Stroke."
6504 2018-07-13 17:36:22 You seem to have this uncanny knack of requiring an update in the middle of my 3 weeks on an offshore oil rig where the Wi-fi is too bad to update.
6505 2018-07-13 17:36:13 There's some places that don't change oil frequently enough thus your fries don't taste it's best. When frying oil is clean they are delicious.
6506 2018-07-13 17:36:11 Ok it includes natural gas as well, my bad
6507 2018-07-13 17:35:48 He nodded. He gently wiped a hand over your oil gland and tried smoothing the oil into your skin.

6509 2018-07-13 17:35:40 It’s always someone on Erie Ave trying to give me their mixtape or asking me to smell their oil 
6510 2018-07-13 17:35:34 Consider that never happened and Trump is doing everything to damage Russian standing competitively, like talking about the Russo-Deutsche oil pipelines,  where Russia provides Germany 70% of its fuel for a large sum of cash,  handled by a former German Head of State.

6512 2018-07-13 17:35:30 My fave is pretty simple. A bit of olive oil, homemade tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and some basil. Salt and pepper to taste.
6513 2018-07-13 17:35:10 Since Trump is Compromised, and he was set to promise reduced sanctions to get at that Exxon Russian oil, Mueller team has tied Trump’s hands! Putin doesn’t blame Trump & spares his life.

6520 2018-07-13 17:34:08 The struggle is real when I try to put sunscreen on my tattoos and tanning oil on the rest of me 
6521 2018-07-13 17:34:03 Is it reality that US firms got contracts? No. But whole theory of war about oil is rubbish. It was a dumb move based on false idea that we can teach democracy to societies that still have much growing up to do.
6522 2018-07-13 17:34:01 My scalp usually hates me for the first 2 weeks or getting twists done. No matter how much ACV I spray and oil to massage my scalp it does not care

6525 2018-07-13 17:33:49 Glenn, you failed to mention what kind of Stakeholders. 
Corporate, mining, oil, gas?

6536 2018-07-13 17:33:05 my secret trick for hunger is salad mix + tuna

Tuna cans from in water are just like 57 calories instead of fucking 232

And if you add pepper it all tastes fine. 

1 tbsp of olive oil, pepper, salad mix, and tuna is my fav way to spend 220 calories

6547 2018-07-13 17:31:20 You use palm oil in your ice cream/milk.  If not from sustainable sources, this causes deforestation in Indonesia-Malaysia, destroys habitat for orangutans, displaces indigenous peoples, enslaves workers and exacerbates global warming. Where do u get ur palm oil?
6548 2018-07-13 17:31:12 Partially happy because the Jeep is getting an oil change. Mostly happy because the dealer has a massage chair.

6554 2018-07-13 17:29:54 My dog has been sick for a while and her nose has been extremely dry.  I tried everything, coconut oil, olive oil, grape seed oil, chap stick, etc nothing helped! I finally tried putting vaseline on it and it's miraculous how much it has helped #seniordog #doglovers #dogs 
6555 2018-07-13 17:29:51 That’s fair. It seems ridiculous to think that cordoning off oil to an entire country wouldn’t have deleterious effects on its economy and well being of ordinary people. And yes the UNSC went along but it was definitely led by the US.
6556 2018-07-13 17:29:49 K

6561 2018-07-13 17:28:56 When will yall get new material? Make up your minds... is Trump a Russian mastermind or a an idiot being duped? I guess we can just pretend that he isn't working against Russian interests (Oil, Syria, Sanctions, etc...) to make sure the pro-Russian narrative still works.

6574 2018-07-13 17:27:39 Must have been a pretty small sample size. An hour in any mall in YYC says we've got the oil labour here and they obviously have the management.

6585 2018-07-13 17:26:36 I think you need to read your tweet again. You posed questions regarding North Koreans using oil to hear their homes and cook. My tweet pointed out how North Koreans surveyed by other North Koreans said they absolutely do not use it for these activities.
6586 2018-07-13 17:26:34 And we are the 6th largest producer of crude oil in the world
6587 2018-07-13 17:26:33 Trump put himself in the drivers seat by dressing down Merkel for being dependent upon Russia for their daily oil supplies while grifting us for NATO-
Rosenstien is trying to empower Putin because Trump is expected to buy the BS-
the chances of seeing 16 trusty Ruskies is remote-
6588 2018-07-13 17:26:16 There’s a time I was coerced into buying cooking oil... it was so horrible 
6589 2018-07-13 17:26:11 Your country is fucked when you have some of the largest oil reserves in the world and building a refinery...for the gasoline your people use every day is "crazy."
6590 2018-07-13 17:26:08 Yep, giving Germany hell for paying Russia billions for oil... I'm sure that is exactly what Putin wants.

Adding oil into your night routine doesn't make your skin feel greasy at all when you wake up
6594 2018-07-13 17:25:20 No the biggest barrier to US-UK trade is ERoEI (Energy Return on Energy Invested) Look at the frightening debt issuances of US fracking companies. Easily recoverable oil is nearly gone. Remember we live in energy based economies - not financial ones.

6646 2018-07-13 17:20:17 Countries like Japan and South Korea however do get their overwhelming majority of oil from the Middle East. The greatest oil players in the Middle East are Shell and BP, Shell is Dutch and BP is British. The only reason they got bases there is to keep stability in the region.
6647 2018-07-13 17:20:16 Indian Oil consumption has gone up by over 9% aprrox. and fundamentally Oil price control will be difficult for world. Election on card by next year the govt. will try to reduce & control dollar prices by spending buffer foreign reserves.

Has the US wanted middle eastern oil they would have kept Kuwait as a colony which produces 10% of the worlds oil

6728 2018-07-15 23:56:49 The price of oil had nothing to do with it. A colleague used to work for an oil company before Venezuela took over the industry and did not compensate for all assets, ran the assets into the ground, while being, well Socialist. The corrupt regime is a failure as is socialism
6729 2018-07-15 23:56:39 Thank you for getting back to me.

I agree and I'm very concerned. When I was a kid my father would say that one day wars would be fought over water and it would become more valuable than oil. People laughed at him.

6751 2018-07-15 23:52:30 in how many countries with large oil fields and two of the biggest river in the world people don't have electricity or water ?
6752 2018-07-15 23:52:30 point of the tax credit wasnt to benefit consumers, the point was to encourage companies to develop electric cars. And now there are electric vehicles that are affordable enough for non-rich people to buy.

Secondly, oil companies get huge tax breaks. That's y gas in US is cheap

6774 2018-07-15 23:47:42 Alberta's 2 main exports are xenophobia and oil
6775 2018-07-15 23:47:34 @Pillsbury my mouth is coated in the palm oil you put in your cookie dough, absolute garbage.
6776 2018-07-15 23:47:28 ...I'd just about forgotten about the baby oil... thank you for that
6777 2018-07-15 23:47:16 on the oil city to Franklin trail
6778 2018-07-15 23:47:15 I just want to relax y’all,  I want a full body massage with warm oil so bad 
6779 2018-07-15 23:47:10 Trump delivered arms to the Ukraine, denounced the annexation of Crimea, wiped out a Russian batallion in Syria, made North Korea off limits for Russia, is bringing the oil price down. What is it that makes him a lap dog?
6780 2018-07-15 23:47:00 Let's hope Ellsworth doesn't use baby oil to get himself out of the cage #ExtremeRules
6781 2018-07-15 23:46:54 Definitely gotta reformulate my Body Oil with what I just learned. 
6782 2018-07-15 23:46:50 We have the best lithium ? Really ! We should ramp up the international prices then, like they do to us with the oil. Make it 20 times more expensive for them, after all, we've been ripped off left right n centre for 100 yrs by US & Arabs for resources, time to repay the favour !
6783 2018-07-15 23:46:33 Do we know what other herbs Romans scented their oil with??
6784 2018-07-15 23:46:22 @KingNj90 I'm thinking baby oil. You?
6785 2018-07-15 23:46:17 How amazing would it be if Ellsworth tried to pull the Enzo spot and oil himself up to slip through the bars but because he's... differently shaped, he gets stuck. @WWE sign me as a damn writer already! #ExtremeRules

The inland food is not as good...
6790 2018-07-15 23:45:05 Please explain the danger to the pristine Artic: Trump’s cronies want oil -gas-minerals in the Artic & Canada Tundra- so does Putin + NW passage. Who can stop them?
6791 2018-07-15 23:45:05 I went to Costco and left with a gallon of olive oil and a jug of pork rinds. What?
6792 2018-07-15 23:44:59 Heads up, #OOTT ..... the online job site "Indeed" has 11 new job listings for "crude oil risk" and no new ads - -0- - for "crude oil trader".   
It would seem to me taht there might be some financial "pain" being experienced in the Oilpatch's crude oil trading and hedging teams.

6794 2018-07-15 23:44:28 Its a vicious cycle. Need to start wriggling out of palm oil clutches.

6797 2018-07-15 23:43:40 People who believe in pollution but not climate change are silly - the idea that we can pollute a river by pouring poison into it, but that the atmosphere is determined entirely by God, even though we're also pouring poison into it,

People don't understand what coal and oil are.
6798 2018-07-15 23:43:38 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
6799 2018-07-15 23:43:34 So what yer saying is to put MORE funko pops and gameboys in my oil paintings?
6800 2018-07-15 23:43:29 And S. McCain AZ fails to mention Putin is the ultimate beneficiary of Gulf Oil profits of/by Americans (I.e. The Army Corps of Engineers). And maybe all of commie (Ltd LLP LLC) GEO’s.

6825 2018-07-15 23:39:37 Term limits for all elected officials, electoral college revamped , political parties scrapped, marijuana legalized everywhere, actual health care system that works for everyone.

6831 2018-07-15 23:38:53 I kinda wanna keep putting random geeky things in my still lifes, like the random gameboy or a pokemon thing, but it somehow feels weird, like it's sacrilege to the HIGH ART OF OIL PAINTINGS
6832 2018-07-15 23:38:43 I wont say that's false, but many city's around Canada who's government cry's about Alberta's oil sands like to drain their sewage into the oceans. So i cant really say that removing the oil sands is any worse but at least we aren't just draining it into the ocean to remove it.
6833 2018-07-15 23:38:35 Yo @wawa I know that traditionally coffee is served in the AM but since you sell it all day, could you maybe brew a fresh pot every once in a while after 2 pm? While it was pouring into my cup I was unsure if I was getting a beverage or watching sludge drain during an oil change

6854 2018-07-15 23:34:33 Venezuelan oil is a perfect example. They nationalized. Got rid of the experts. And immediately ruined the system.

6887 2018-07-15 23:30:01 Very few heavy oil cost inputs are from the states. Input costs are local (ie: natural gas, labor, R&M, etc). Even the drilling side imports very little from the other side of the line

6904 2018-07-15 23:27:23 Hope Finn loses because he stopped the baby oil videos
6905 2018-07-15 23:26:39 Self care in the form of rubbing lavender oil on my temples while muttering “serenity now”
6906 2018-07-15 23:26:31 The only thing which helps me a little is to alternate ice pack and heat along with a good squirt of CBD oil.  Not fun.  My sympathies.
6907 2018-07-15 23:26:27 Yes, this all comes down to energy issues: nuclear power in the Middle East, oil exploration in the North Sea, and LNG transshipment in Europe.
6908 2018-07-15 23:26:11 Trouble with the 4age is it's such a strong engine it hides oil problems well, but obviously you have an issue with valve stem seals or rings if you're burning it. Mine leaks a little at the distributor but I've never bothered with it as it doesn't "use" any between services.
6909 2018-07-15 23:25:56 @Ihnatko your comment on the show about the importance of good olive oil made me think maybe we should feature our olive oil next!  I will work with @lisadlaporte  to make sure all the hosts get some bottles to try (Some of the best discussions on MBW sometimes are good related!)
6910 2018-07-15 23:25:50 身勝手の極意ほんと
6911 2018-07-15 23:25:45 F*ck NO... I predicted this Nov/16, it has been their end game to drill the SH*T out of Alaska since day one... That’s why 19.5% of Rosenoft was traded over.  ALL about GREED & OIL.  And if they do we can kiss this planet goodbye. 
6912 2018-07-15 23:25:42 We foot the bill for 50,000 troops in Germany.... to protect them from Russia.

They turn around and by natural gas and oil from us?  Or Russia?

Interesting friendship

6914 2018-07-15 23:25:09 Someone sell me your oil 
6915 2018-07-15 23:25:06 Rt I’m thinking about finding an oil field man & running the bar with my mom.
6916 2018-07-15 23:25:00 @HondaCustSvc Bought a new 2018 Odyssesy ex l.   Asked for a free oil change first change and was told they don’t do that anymore.    At Garvia Honda Albuquerque, NM.  ??
6917 2018-07-15 23:24:58 UK recently signed oil deal with #CMR terrorists state to exploit the oil but in the conflict zone thereby funding the genocide. What a joke
6918 2018-07-15 23:24:53 My god I laughed my ass off on this.
6919 2018-07-15 23:24:48 Just got a oil change lets go on a road trip
6920 2018-07-15 23:24:34 "Natural" has palm oil. Terrible. Disgusting.
6921 2018-07-15 23:24:18 Oil spill shots are so cute 
6922 2018-07-15 23:23:54 I’m trying the vegan style tonight and imma use it in replace of olive oil
6923 2018-07-15 23:23:51 When you go to ford to get a oil change they’ll fix it for free. Nissan did that for me when I had my maxima.
6924 2018-07-15 23:23:46 I’m in the industry, there’s no rhyme or reason for oil prices! I have no idea what he meant by controlling gas prices, that’s not possible from what I know, if he thinks he can he’ll try, I love high gas prices personally so I hope he fails at that goal 
6925 2018-07-15 23:23:38 take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and
promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden

6928 2018-07-15 23:22:53 Great!  I’m glad you liked it - only makes sense to have product spots when the hosts really like the product. Next month we will feature our olive oil then!  I’ll be in touch with the TWIT ad dept
6929 2018-07-15 23:22:29 *sees the bit about rancid coffee oil*
Yeah nah okay you're excused.
6930 2018-07-15 23:22:10 Yup. Explains a lot about the oil industry. We reached peak oil last year.
6931 2018-07-15 23:21:29 Lol that’s true. My aunt cooks with a lot of oil but I just avoid it when dishing mine out. I do the same thing I make sure to eat a serving of fruits, a salad, and a smoothie everyday
6932 2018-07-15 23:21:29 Are you L’oil ??
6933 2018-07-15 23:21:24 Well it takes vegetable oil to make Twinkies. Lol. Ijs

6935 2018-07-15 23:21:04 And that that is accepted by a large portion of society as undeniable proof that someone is a nazi is a bigger problem than a couple of drunk assholes.  Because the two sides of this particular discussion are oil on one side and fire on the other.
6936 2018-07-15 23:21:04 It’s been a long, hard road this trip around, Edward! That’s why and how I know that my Lord & Savior has made a mansion for me.  I’ll never have to do this again! I sure wished that CBD OIL & CREAM WORKED FOR ME.  I hear some ppl are getting some relief, that makes me happy!

6938 2018-07-15 23:20:46 so my coconut oil melted
6939 2018-07-15 23:20:39 probably also worth noting that most of the frackers are (were) independents; big oil companies weren't interested in the risk (are now, but then....) good story for the little guys
6940 2018-07-15 23:20:33 All the trains I see here in S. Ont. are tankers (mostly oil products, I assume) or shipping containers. The latter can be put on truck trailers, but aren't usually as far as I can see.
6941 2018-07-15 23:20:28 I have a bottle of hair oil, it's an applicator bottle. Explain to me how ants reach in the bottle of oil.
6942 2018-07-15 23:20:19 Why are they arresting them when they don't want to sell the oil could be worked on for space travel.
6943 2018-07-15 23:20:15 Lol yeah but some people don’t care for minimum oil they’ll use the whole bottle of red oil and still think that’s not enough  it’s wild! I try to eat salads and fruit and drink a lot of water after to feel better
6944 2018-07-15 23:20:01 ありがとうございます(*≧∀≦*)
6945 2018-07-15 23:19:57 True. No one thought they could survive if oil feel below 75 a barrel.
6946 2018-07-15 23:19:53 It's okay sir. Jwu here. 

Good morning 
6947 2018-07-15 23:19:40 Yep, engine still ran ok but the oil burning made getting through an mot an issue every year. Well driven I did a few track days Also was involved in a no fault shunt that did front and rear crash structures but lucky that MR2DC did a very good insurance back then that fixed it.
6948 2018-07-15 23:19:39 Mr. President, KODOS for exposing Germanys plan's to purchase its oil from Russia during NATO Summit.  On the good side Germany has been a Leader in integrating 29 European countries into the (EU).  However, they have lost 2 World Wars thus, caution is paramount.
6949 2018-07-15 23:19:34 Can someone help me out with this -  were the tainted East Timor oil negotiations between our countries and Australia's intervention after the referendum to secede from Indonesia. Are these things connected to one another?
6950 2018-07-15 23:19:27 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
6951 2018-07-15 23:19:22 Have you been on an oil derrick??? They wear hard hats you idiot!
6952 2018-07-15 23:19:14 Oil it. Once you oil it it’ll set in that heat and be good.
6953 2018-07-15 23:18:42 germany is buying oil and gas from your so called enemy Russia, booker; who, why votes for this guy
6954 2018-07-15 23:18:41 It all depends on you make it too lmao I think it comes down to portion control, minimum oil use, and drinking tea and infused water to help metabolise all the fats
6955 2018-07-15 23:18:35 Spilled coconut oil all over me. Didn’t realize it was melted 
6956 2018-07-15 23:18:07 So yesterday I went to a Que cookout & tried their “oil” for the first time. It tasted like wine. I thought.. “this would be perfect to drink before I go to bed” so i filled 2 water bottles with it and took it home. Guess what i’m sipping on now? 
6957 2018-07-15 23:17:46 I dropped a pot of boiling oil on my foot and kept working thru it. Some people are just bitches
6958 2018-07-15 23:17:40 I've used it in a pinch when I was out of my regular oil. Not bad, I didn't really taste anything off or very different (but usually I use it for my hair LOL)
6959 2018-07-15 23:17:09 Clove oil instantly takes the pain away. It only works for a short time but it works wonders. Plus you can take pain killers with it.
6960 2018-07-15 23:17:04 It’s made out of egg yolk and cooking oil

6980 2018-07-15 23:13:53 I’m positively sure we won’t attack anyone because we don’t want to GIVE away half of our products or pay Ransom to OPEC for their oil that we can produce here  Only a politician that’s making cash on the side  from these people are worried!
6981 2018-07-15 23:13:41 Your dermatologist can prescribe extra strength gel and acne cream for your fem area . Get foam wash as well. Always exfoliate . Those help prevent and decrease bumps. Tumeric , shea butter and cocoa butter oil help reduce the dbark spots.

6984 2018-07-15 23:13:12 Teresa May felt out possibly invoking article 5 over the Novichok chemical warfare attacks.  I wish she would do it. Here we have an actual chemical and nuke threat to confront that also sits on oil, lol. I say we take Crimea and raze the bridge.

6992 2018-07-15 23:12:02 Yeah would be so good to have a guy that decided not to save oil resource earnings to help the province in bad times. Instead he gave every man woman and child a $400 cheque. Just let the good times roll. Had way too many night caps to make rational decisions.
6993 2018-07-15 23:12:00 I live in toledo and have always wondered what it is about this city that makes storms either go around or weaken then regenerate to the east, then it dawned on me, could the 2 large oil refineries have something to do with it?  #ohwx @NWSCLE @StormOfCorn

You can add olive oil to it and use as salad dressing 
#ALDUB3Years
7015 2018-07-15 23:08:49 @DrGundry Does boiling greens and then draining them such as chicory, dandelion, Swiss chard before adding olive oil and salt destroy the nutritional value of the greens?
7016 2018-07-15 23:08:40 Russia wants to monopolize world oil market.

7025 2018-07-15 23:07:40 Has anyone had any experience of using CBD oil?
7026 2018-07-15 23:07:16 Well, we know that Obama biggest donor is the owner of BNSF and BNSF is the best positioned US Railway for hauling oil. Makes sense Canada is same.
7027 2018-07-15 23:07:11 My first bought in 95, it started using oil at 220k miles so srarted to take a back seat. Have had 5 in all but could never sell the first !
7028 2018-07-15 23:07:04 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly and feminist friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing feminist friendly oil = oppressing women around the world.
7029 2018-07-15 23:07:01 Hi lain. I use them in oil daily and they perform great . holds tons of paint, no drag real smooth. And my brush lines are little to none. Flow perfectly. Have you tried @Staalmeester new full synthetic 2020 series.

7032 2018-07-15 23:06:46 Do you even bother to read a study before you tweet? It changed methodology from 2016 to 2017. You should be skeptical of these results. Especially one paid for by an oil company.

7040 2018-07-15 23:05:47 Sadam Hussein had oil wells torched for the same method of obfuscation and delay. They knew they had lost! OVERWORK those cleaning up WHILE creating more trouble on their way to jail/execution.

7043 2018-07-15 23:05:18 2/. One difference between the two is that Venezuela owes debts denominated in foreign currency and over relies on oil revenue to make those payments.  Norway has no obligations in any other currency than its own, which it itself issues.  Like America.

7046 2018-07-15 23:04:56 He's probably aware of it - even Trump isn't that stupid - but the Republican partyis, which he represents, is heavily financed by the oil industry. Rather like Harper up there.
7047 2018-07-15 23:04:55 There is no oil in Afghanistan. Sorry about that.
7048 2018-07-15 23:04:52 No one can argue those reasons without seeming a little heartless. Those services will always be taken care of. You can't be positive that any of that money would ever reach those services. Alberta made it clear long ago that NO province or territory would profit off their oil.

7057 2018-07-15 23:03:17 Shake Shack fries are actually great, they’re just not “french fries” which have enough oil and just want acid from ketchup—they are in fact americanized chips or frittes, and as such need additional oil from mayo or cheese sauce to shine. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

7067 2018-07-15 23:00:37 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Let that sink in.
7068 2018-07-15 23:00:35 You do know that even the US gets crude oil from Russia yes? So it’s not crazy. They’re just using this to try to put Germany down for they’re own political bullshit, or I meant agenda.

7075 2018-07-15 22:59:31 All this trade war talk. Does Russia have any trade with any country other than oil? Sounds like they are a very small economy if that’s all they got.  Why worry about them. They will go away
7076 2018-07-15 22:59:20 I wonder how many oil barons and cattle ranchers Louie Gohmert has taken money from? I wonder if those donors had affairs?
I wonder if a Democrat would mind releasing that information.

Speaking from experience & observation here
Very sad
7084 2018-07-15 22:56:20 Why do we give subsidies to big oil?

Big Oil makes billions in PROFIT (what's left after all bills are paid).

The excuse for the subsidies is 'exploration & research'. That is already paid for leaving billions in profit. 

1 example of many of $$$ going to the wrong places.

7086 2018-07-15 22:56:11 The Senate, shouldn't be transferring control of federal land to any mining or oil drilling interests. Most Americans want to conserve federal lands, & don't want these lands polluted. They should put it on a ballot, & let American ppl decide.

7092 2018-07-15 22:54:49 Coconut hair oil day. One of the best studies on this was conducted in India in 2002. Researchers found that coconut oil reduces damage both as a pre-wash and post grooming treatment.
7093 2018-07-15 22:54:35 I hope they’re also refusing to pay for rice, sugar, palm oil and non-locally grown produce otherwise this is just billionaire virtue signaling and not an actual attempt at an “environmentally friendly” diet.

Olive Oil, as far I remember only one is Catalan, the rest majority from Spain. So probably you are buying Spanish products and you don't know yet. Cured Ham, hmmm..Jamon Serrano?... Spanish. Not many Catalans products I am afraid.
7095 2018-07-15 22:54:29 It's all about that multi-billion dollar Russian oil deal, right? Putin has all the money he needs to bribe just about anyone. Especially a Trump.
7096 2018-07-15 22:54:23 Sometimes I think my joints could use a little oil...
7097 2018-07-15 22:54:13 I think we both know bank stocks will be fine. A lot of oil hedge money plus higher interest rates and buybacks.

7117 2018-07-15 22:50:01 The fried clam plate from Celebrity Pizza. Between three and seven minutes after they come out, when the oil is cooling but not congealed yet, they're the best fried clams on the planet.
7118 2018-07-15 22:50:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

My dad used to smother them in oil and put them in the oven.  Even if I haven't used a pan for a few, it seasons up right away after a couple uses.

7128 2018-07-15 22:49:03 I’m at @jiffylube getting my oil changed & headlight fixed. The crew is all women & they’re singing to each other while working. This makes me so happy 
7129 2018-07-15 22:48:47 Palm oil reduces the amount of land needed for soy bean oil, but like any other crop/orchard depends on HOW + appropriates of where it's done. In Ecuador organic intercropped agroforestry of palm trees on restored land is well done though less than 1% of palm oil production

7133 2018-07-15 22:48:37 Now that's a very good question! 
Perhaps its the profiteers from defense spending?  Maybe its those oil people who have financial plans? Maybe its Israel's intense lobby?  
Maybe the bias propaganda perpetuated by Israeli ownership of our major media?

7135 2018-07-15 22:48:13 find yourself a small bottle of clove oil. 100% clove oil. it might be labeled as an essential oil, it might be an aromatherapy oil. it is a old cure for dental pain. pharmacies or a vitamin shop will carry it. 5-6 bucks at most.
7136 2018-07-15 22:48:11 Long time ago, my boss was a guy who’d been a senior VP for BK International. He liked to describe the lengthy process they undertook to revamp the chain’s french fries in the mid-1990s: Potatoes, cooking oil, etc. I could not believe he didn’t know how much they sucked.
7137 2018-07-15 22:48:06 WW2 was about neither oil or imperialism. I'm not a Brit, but I know that much. Come down off your idealistic mountain and get real.
7138 2018-07-15 22:47:48 I threw a heap of coconut oil in my hair and did a massive skincare routine and an all over body exfoliation and moisturize and I feel so SOFT and GLOWY

7154 2018-07-15 22:44:22 NATO is abusing America and it must stop. And on top of it they are getting their oil from the same entity we are trying to defend them against. Thus making our enemies richer to produce far more lethal weapons to destroy us with. Common Sense is all that is needed to solve this.

7178 2018-07-15 22:38:24 Snake  oil salesman is right! Do you see TRav he’s a 45 lover?!
7179 2018-07-15 22:38:14 For Norway, she was a very good economic partner until 2014 (Some offshore oil refineries off Norway were managed by Russia). now, only God knows the evolution
7180 2018-07-15 22:37:53 Seasonal oil trade out for a small profit on the open.
7181 2018-07-15 22:37:44 We go dey here dey help you Oil their engine. When you come, you fit come start your Gen
7182 2018-07-15 22:37:41 “giving aid & comfort to their enemies” - Russia has committed an act of Ward against the U.S. beyond doubt.  It is no different than cutting off water supply,  oil supply, electricity under the law.
7183 2018-07-15 22:37:41 Off This Kush & Oil
7184 2018-07-15 22:36:48 Wood used to be 100% of the worlds fuel.. until it was displaced by coal and oil.
The time is right/overdid to replace coal with smarter energy.

If you weren’t being paid to spruik coal Matt.. you would be pushing RE for your farmers/party members.
7185 2018-07-15 22:36:46 trying to decide whether to use my oil pastel brush or my flat brush !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can’t decide !!!!!!!!
7186 2018-07-15 22:36:38 In short - we are spolied rotten for food options in Melbourne. We have ALL THE CATEGORIES. Fresh. Tasty. Variety. Well-prepped. And affordable. Fuck diversity & multiculturalism ruining me for the world. I just wanted some nice dumplings in chilli oil & broth on a Sunday arvo

7188 2018-07-15 22:36:28 my natural hair is so thick  & it’s like the mf eats the oil I put in it .
7189 2018-07-15 22:36:10 hot oil treatment + deep conditioning
7190 2018-07-15 22:36:02 Looks good but foolish to count your chickens...never underestimate the susceptibility of the British public to thatcherite snake oil or the capacity of the Labour movement to damage its electability courtesy of public squabbling from toxic blairites and Hard Left ideologues.
7191 2018-07-15 22:36:00 China is winning that battle though. They pretty much control the raw materials in Africa and Latin America. Spent a lot of time working in Angola. From about 2006 they quietly took control of the oil there. Same in the DRC
7192 2018-07-15 22:35:37 James changed my oil, washed the outside and cleaned the inside of my car all while I was napping. 

I don’t know what I did to deserve him.
7193 2018-07-15 22:35:23 Mariners are leaking oil and driving on two flat tires as we head into the All Star break. Now is where GM Jerry DiPoto will show his worth (or not). #TradingDeadline
7194 2018-07-15 22:34:59 I'm going to be looking up confit garlic oil recipes once I get home tonight. For now I'll stuff myself with lemon bundt cake
7195 2018-07-15 22:34:57 I don't get what is really the problem here. Is it oil wants them to stop?
7196 2018-07-15 22:34:21 เอ่อ... ใครวะ
7197 2018-07-15 22:34:11 Awesome... Now what are you going to do about tRUMP and the oil companies destroying the planet ... The rest of the way

7201 2018-07-15 22:33:34 Put way too much tea tree oil in my Shea butter. Whole body tingling
7202 2018-07-15 22:33:21 Having worked there, they have places that are perfectly fine, and then they have places that will burn you out faster than an oil drowned wick.

So, I'm kinda meh cause I work at a decent building, though I'm starting to see the point where it gets terrible comming up soon...
7203 2018-07-15 22:33:10 My plug is a growerI love sippin oil

7210 2018-07-15 22:32:28 So my sister gave me “tea tree oil” to use and my hair now smells heavily of acetone. I have an interview tmmw. What should I do.
7211 2018-07-15 22:32:18 my 91 yr old grandfather ran over himself with his tractor.  He said he was changing the oil.  thank God he was okay after getting checked at the hospital
7212 2018-07-15 22:32:04 Grilled broccoli is amazing. Separate it out into large sections, I toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Directly on heat for about 10 minutes so there's a little char.
7213 2018-07-15 22:31:56 *Scotland's oil wealth
7214 2018-07-15 22:31:48 Hmmm we would if we owned half of the worlds oil

7217 2018-07-15 22:31:11 BUT I don’t plan on flat ironing it this week so ima just wear it up. And my hair tends to drink up oil. So I should be good until I wash it next week (hopefully).
7218 2018-07-15 22:30:55 I use  ozonated jojoba coconut oil for oil pulling.Great stuff.
7219 2018-07-15 22:30:39 Found a stretch mark on my lower stomach and literally just clattered myself in bio oil

7223 2018-07-15 22:30:17 You may also consider getting off social media as it arouses stress and cortisol. Go watch a cartoon instead. Your body AND brain need to unplug. Warm baths with peppermint oil and Epsom salts will help also. mostly important REST!
7224 2018-07-15 22:30:15 come on Mr Nance.  given the power system Musk is challenging (auto industry, utility industry, big oil/ carbon), which includes Russia BTW, attacks on @elonmusk and @tesla are propaganda until proven otherwise
7225 2018-07-15 22:30:14 All this packaging, las las na 19,800... Diaris God ooooooo
7226 2018-07-15 22:30:09 You don't need to be an extrovert to appreciate some good oats and olive oil
7227 2018-07-15 22:30:05 @RowdyScarlett   World Oil reaches $400 a barrell     Prices in most Countrys reach $29 a gallon.     Price in Goon 30 cents a Gallon.
7228 2018-07-15 22:29:57 when i feel the slightest bit of nausea i just put a lil dab of peppermint oil on my forehead and i feel so much better its insane
7229 2018-07-15 22:29:56 This how you know I ain’t did a hot oil treatment in a while.. used to much dang oil.  and I don’t feel like re-washing my hair.
7230 2018-07-15 22:29:54 I’m so afraid of doing a peel. That’s the only step I never done. Is it worth it? I seen people use rose hip oil afterwards. Does that help?
7231 2018-07-15 22:29:49 You keep your "love oil" away from him!
7232 2018-07-15 22:29:46 —-while every other billionaire is being an asshole while trying to sell the world more oil, or alcohol, or telecom. Perspective is important here.
7233 2018-07-15 22:29:28 I'll take her temperature if possible, if it's normal the cough should go away by itself. Maybe adding a small amount of vegetable oil to food might help.
7234 2018-07-15 22:29:09 It's like when he said we should have just taken Iraq's oil.

Just fold it up and put it in Melania's suitcase.
7235 2018-07-15 22:28:47 I went to eccentric holistic nurse aint house about my eye bc them steroid eye drop weren’t doing shit for me ... she gave me medical grade CBD oil thc free &&& it got me back better than ever ??
7236 2018-07-15 22:28:35 What an incredible shot! A tanned, nude, roughneck letting it all hang out behind his pick up, in the oil fields Okla-Tex? Ever make prints available of these? Great job 
7237 2018-07-15 22:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
7238 2018-07-15 22:27:52 Let us see...Russia does not trade with the world much....nor Iran....and they both have much oil wealth. US tech and innovation rules worldwide!
7239 2018-07-15 22:27:47 Just a Lil bit of oil
7240 2018-07-15 22:27:42 i been smelling this wild growth oil since i put it on  i’m sick of it
7241 2018-07-15 22:27:27 I braid up my hair to protect it . It’s humid af out here and people love to touch my hair so I braid it up because it’s cute and easy and y’all trash ass people don’t damage my hair with your oil non clean hands.
7242 2018-07-15 22:27:04 I love the feeling of oil on my skin. I feel luxurious, moisturised and luxurious.
7243 2018-07-15 22:26:54 Meanwhile he-man continues to oil his nipples while wearing nothing but BDSM straps and a merkin.
7244 2018-07-15 22:26:51 Fun fact: sweden offered half of Volvo for half of norways oil back in the day. Norway was on board but sweden backed out of the deal. Worst business mistake ever? / Swede
7245 2018-07-15 22:26:37 Essential oils. Been using them for my hair every day and it does wonders for it. Haven't had frizz in months and they give you different effects depending on what oil you use.
7246 2018-07-15 22:26:27 It’s prescient and heartbreaking.  We could and should have had a smart, experienced and savvy President.  Instead we have a dim witted snake oil salesman, puppet who’s more concerned about his own personal interests than the nation’s interests. Tragic.
7247 2018-07-15 22:26:23 Time for a olive oil deal.
7248 2018-07-15 22:26:13 So gas is $1.39/L now. Ugh. 
That's $3.99/gallon for those in the US. 
Living in oil country...

7249 2018-07-15 22:26:04 Anyone else get dolled up just to masturbate ? Like set the whole mood? Oil down, allat ?
7250 2018-07-15 22:25:53 prove it.  makes no sense and he denies.  you’re shorting tesla, right ?  or working big oil?
7251 2018-07-15 22:25:51 In what universe was that a defense?? You oversimplified what happened by making it sound as though the NYT collaborated w/ the US gov to get oil from Iraq, and Miller was their henchwoman. I've got nothing positive to say for her, or for the NYT's coverage leading up to Iraq.
7252 2018-07-15 22:25:46 Data is the new oil.
7253 2018-07-15 22:25:30 I had to abandon my prunes at the supermarket checkout today, and I don't know when I'll next be able to afford the nice olive oil I like from the health shop #Poorgeoisie #Argentina #MiddleClassProblems
7254 2018-07-15 22:25:26 ちなひ〜〜、、
7255 2018-07-15 22:25:19 Thankful for the gift of Argan oil
7256 2018-07-15 22:25:13 It hurt my heart to see it, but thank you for sharing it. Americans never see the children and the price they pay for our war profiteering and oil and gas profiteering politicians and their lobbyists. I vote for no one who backs the Pentagon budget. No. One.
7257 2018-07-15 22:25:02 Mineral oil tak sesuai dengan yang jenis acne prone kan ?
7258 2018-07-15 22:25:00 ちなひ、、
7259 2018-07-15 22:24:52 Is Tai lopez trying to sell me snake oil? or is he real with it
7260 2018-07-15 22:24:51 Has to be
7261 2018-07-15 22:24:36 これ！
7262 2018-07-15 22:24:22 Gear oil is probably the worst smell in the world, that shits getting me nauseas rn
7263 2018-07-15 22:24:17 I hate the smell of castor oil but it is life.
7264 2018-07-15 22:24:03 just paid over $4/gallon at the pump again and wishing that Bush stole more of that delicious Iraqi oil
7265 2018-07-15 22:24:03 The pungent aroma of ginger and peppermint oil....
7266 2018-07-15 22:23:55 I heard someone say on the radio the other day "if you set still you become rusty." I have to disagree and here's why. The bible says to SIT STILL and know that I am God. (Psalm 46:10) SOMETIMES IT TAKES STILLNESS TO GET THE OIL.
7267 2018-07-15 22:23:53 The color is veg oil and water but I’m sure it is mechanical. It is one of two things, either someone filled the tractor hydraulics with water or someone watering golf carts used a gas can for water and didn’t empty it out.
7268 2018-07-15 22:23:45 We have 2 Pkg Deals right now. The First one is Buy 3 CBD Oil and get the 4th one Free for $199.95

7271 2018-07-15 22:23:07 At night Put olive oil on face and massage for 12-20 min then wash with warm water 
7272 2018-07-15 22:22:45 Nigeria have about the same amount of oil as Norway has, and yet look where Nigeria is. It makes me so sad, all the money is literally in the pockets of a few lazy idiots who don't want to work hard to be rich but rather want to steal. It's such an embarrassment to Africa.
7273 2018-07-15 22:22:36 Milk thistle and its close relative, globe artichoke. protects the liver against sunflower oil and other polyunsaturated fatty acids.
7274 2018-07-15 22:22:27 Meanwhile Trump chastises Germany for buying Russian gas while he blew up the Iran Deal so Putin's oil and gas were more attractive. See how this works? After all of Trump's insults, EU not about to take one for the team, Sam.
7275 2018-07-15 22:22:22 omg when we called him about the oil
7276 2018-07-15 22:22:17 A year or so old but: G ermany imported 91.1 million tonnes crude oil (Germany also imports additional mineral oil products). Russia was by far the largest supplier in 2016, delivering 36 million tonnes, or almost 40 percent of oil imports
7277 2018-07-15 22:22:12 . Norway provided 11.1 million tonnes and the UK 9.1 million tonnes. In total, more than 30 countries supplied oil to Germany.
7278 2018-07-15 22:22:06 So, when NATO bombed all of Libya's water infrastructure, that was cool yo! Like destroying Iraq, Syria... and some dictators are good! SAUDs get to kill Yemenis. Do you know what defense spending is? Gov't contracts. Private military, arms dealers, oil theft... "Losing" $21Tn
7279 2018-07-15 22:21:59 rub your oil all over my body please?
7280 2018-07-15 22:21:51 I’m underneath vehicles getting covered in oil all day

7290 2018-07-15 22:20:38 Let me tell you about my nude oil painting.
7291 2018-07-15 22:20:18 Coconut oil. I have really really dry skin and it's the only thing that will moisturize my skin.
7292 2018-07-15 22:20:10 is jelly made of cooking oil
7293 2018-07-15 22:20:07 Coconut oil kinda making my curls come back
7294 2018-07-15 22:20:07 Taylor Swift is every girl in Arlington.
7295 2018-07-15 22:20:01 Or, are you going to work toward diversifying Alberta's economy or are you going to bury your head in the sand and hope that somehow AB can sell oil forever and the price will go up and up?
7296 2018-07-15 22:19:50 "Nothing could be further from the Trump playbook" He's a snake oil merchant

7298 2018-07-15 22:19:24 Defending a libelous billionaire tech bro because it's the only way to avoid buying oil or shopping at Wal-Mart.
7299 2018-07-15 22:19:05 #oott Its a criminal offense for oil to go down. It must go up. Law of nature.
7300 2018-07-15 22:19:04 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
7301 2018-07-15 22:18:54 My hair is soaked in olive oil! Going to do this a couple of times a week as a preventative measure to stop hair loss etc. Interesting findings on how it prevents buildup of DHT in the scalp.
7302 2018-07-15 22:18:51 CBD oil >
7303 2018-07-15 22:18:46 Like what bad ideas? Buying a pipeline so the oil industry benefits?
7304 2018-07-15 22:18:29 How is getting rid of palm oil bad? Reducing beef is also great for environment for reducing methane.

7308 2018-07-15 22:17:39 Extreme Left Venezuelan Government has stripped parliament of power as its opposition gains more seats, stacked courts with its own & virtually eliminated independent media as its economic crisis causes its people to flee this oil rich country.

7311 2018-07-15 22:17:18 We need him to stick around do good stuff, like maybe attempt to rescue children or rid the world of oil dependency.
7312 2018-07-15 22:17:13 Lemme be your man and change your oil
7313 2018-07-15 22:16:56 5 days till Oregon!

7314 2018-07-15 22:16:42 Oh god! The oil kills me.
7315 2018-07-15 22:16:27 Fried green tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, corn, and pasta with olive oil and parmesan
7316 2018-07-15 22:16:27 Yes! When you thaw, you may need to add a bit of water or oil, though.
7317 2018-07-15 22:16:25 わかるけどw
7318 2018-07-15 22:16:17 Btw dont eat escolar 

It's so oil rich that it causes diarrhea.

It is actually illegal to sell as food in Japan

Yet its insanely popular to sell as "extra white tuna" in the US 

X.X
7319 2018-07-15 22:16:05 Pete hummed, dropping a bit  of the oil into his palms before rubbing them together, then ran his hands gently along her back and shoulders. 

"I'm actually super bad at this, so don't laugh."
7320 2018-07-15 22:15:43 Hmmm. Given the 'revolution' kicked off some time ago (and most of the biggies in oil and gas were initially opposed or parachuted out), how does this assertion work? Are you thinking about the US?
7321 2018-07-15 22:15:36 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.

7326 2018-07-15 22:14:53 @mollyyeh I have fallen in love with your show! You’re so genuine and passionate about cooking. Your hubs is adorable and I love the farm. Keep up the good work. Already made your olive oil blondes. Delightful!
7327 2018-07-15 22:14:36 Are y’all deaf n blind on top of Dumb!? What’s positive is; President Trump has Iran, NOKO & Putin back on their heals, Putin’s worried about loosing Germany’s oil$$, NATO is Finally paying up saving US $Bs, More $Bs are coming back into US, More jobs now than ppl willing 2 Work!
7328 2018-07-15 22:14:35 What's the point of a shark cage again? Just to "stop" someone from interfering or do the actual people in the ring have to do something with the cage? When I think of shark cage all I can think of is Enzo using oil to slide his way out.

7332 2018-07-15 22:13:48 US growth is a sugar coat and unsustainable. It's numbers do not reflect actual benefits for its workers, nor increased wages and the stock market boom is almost entirely boosted by Corporate buy backs and inflated oil pricing. All while their national debt has ballooned.

7339 2018-07-15 22:11:40 So I got my mower going & did have the lawn. Took a water break. Refilled the tank. Now the mower won’t start. Oil is fine. It makes a “ding” sound when I pull the cord. Any ideas?

To die for!

7353 2018-07-15 22:08:49 lol, they're not paid enough for that- at this point it's just straight shilling for @bruneski and board taking Elon $- this is how far our Beyond Oil campaigns have fallen that we compromise our values of standing with workers.
7354 2018-07-15 22:08:44 "As of December, the church itself had £123 million in oil and gas investments. "
7355 2018-07-15 22:08:36 Funny how those "just worried about the environment" when it comes to plastic straws needed by disabled people don't seem to care about this wild thing called the oil industry.

Why focus on meaningful change when you can pat yourself on the back for blaming the disabled.

7362 2018-07-15 22:07:34 I am pretty sure the Kremlin's ideal American client would be helping them jack up the price of oil. 

Don't get me wrong- I neither like Trump nor like his footsie with Putin. But his actual Presidency has been a mix of good and bad regarding Russia. As was Obama's.

7366 2018-07-15 22:06:52 No, #JustinTrudeau is giving Canada's fresh water away to the US oil and gas industry, for free. No water meters being installed anywhere on the #TransMountain #pipeline. Once US has this free water US won't need to buy any more of Canada's tar/fake oil or highly toxic H2S gas.
7367 2018-07-15 22:06:42 If oil markets collapsed more severely than when Saudis stopped selling oil to the US in the 70s, hard to see how USD remains global reserve currency (US would have to become chill and cool with Venezuela and Iran again to salvage it)

7381 2018-07-15 22:05:04 Maybe you should tell the rest of us what this fights all about. Unemployment is down, manufacturing jobs are back, coal industry is alive, oil production is opening, farmers will get a fair shot against Canadian tariffs. What the hell are you fighting about Elizabeth?!
7382 2018-07-15 22:05:03 I took a shower then took a bath in baby oil and that was probably the smartest thing I ever did
7383 2018-07-15 22:04:54 After my extra strength Excederin didn’t work, I took a few hits of 250 mg CBD oil and my migraine was gone in 15 minutes. I can’t believe how long it took for that shit to be legal.
7384 2018-07-15 22:04:48 IMO 'big oil' has a big role in this. To fight climate crisis, a rapid transitioning away from fossil fuels must happen. To prepare an orderly, fair, economically reasonable approach, internat'l cooperation is a must. Thus, protectionism/conflict aids in delaying needed action.
7385 2018-07-15 22:04:33 When the oil is hot enough, lightly salt your potatoes and
brown the on all sides. Preheat your oven at 200°C.When you're happy with the colour of the potatoes, place them on a baking tray and pour the oil over the potatoes and put them in the over for 10-15 min
7386 2018-07-15 22:04:30 lmao @ v*voline for trying to sell me everything but the kitchen sink when i come in just to get my oil changed
7387 2018-07-15 22:04:23 There’s some merit to z argument the USD is backed by oil albeit indirectly via petrodollar recycling
7388 2018-07-15 22:04:04 More imp. ignoring families about contamination on land isn't going work cuz of social media. Marginalized familes can't be made into Ludwig terrorists cuz they are just mums and dads now. Jessica Ernst crucified but still yapping. Oil needs to change. @OilGasCanada Social media.
7389 2018-07-15 22:03:30 Studying in a bar/coffee shop (shared lobby I’m in) and came back to my seat with a drink waiting bc “it looks like I’m having a rough day.” 

Can’t decide if this is more of a “you know you’re in law school” or “you know you’re in the oil field” moment. 
7390 2018-07-15 22:03:19 $CL_F just a heads up:

7391 2018-07-15 22:03:07 The neem oil works on fungus too. I will try the coconut oil on my cats! What kind do you use & how much?
7392 2018-07-15 22:03:02 Some exports are allowed including oil, fuel, gas and metals, which are supposed to use for limited purpose - open the Hot Line between North and South Koreas. The US did vote for it. I have only a bad feeling about this. Deja vu, isn't it?
7393 2018-07-15 22:02:53 昨日のpkさんには驚いたなぁ……。普通にBJやり始めたのには笑った。
7394 2018-07-15 22:02:45 Emotional aspects of projects are imp. Communication needs to be factual but also productive in listening to citizen concerns such as fracking contamination of land, air, water. Fracking is introducing chemicals deep into the Earth; no one interested. Oil communication must alter

7402 2018-07-15 22:01:11 Essential Oil Tip: Dilute your essential oils with a carrier oil. Using a carrier oil will not dilute the effect of the essential oil, but it will ensure that oils applied topically (on your skin) are not irritating or overpowering. #essentialoils

7415 2018-07-15 21:59:06 Norway - rich bc it didn't privatise its oil reserves but kept them to benefit citizens. Norway - catches its own fish bc its own fishermen didn't sell off their rights. Norway -happier bc it's more equal. Norway, which has no say over its trading rules with EU. All unlike UK.

7425 2018-07-15 21:56:43 Self regulation. The other day I saw a cab stopped, customers walked up, cabbie got out, locked doors, told them to wait, then walked off. Customers were in disbelief.

Realtors, banking, cell phone companies, big oil, etc are all other prime example of inadequate self-regulation
7426 2018-07-15 21:56:26 Not to mention the glorious weather...

7437 2018-07-15 21:55:08 Every high school should have a mandatory class called "Life" which teaches you how to sew, change a tire, change your oil, do taxes, basic first aid, basic cooking, etc. Basic things you need in real life. They don't even teach that in college.
7438 2018-07-15 21:54:31 Who got the oil?
7439 2018-07-15 21:54:22 “he doesn’t like tea tree oil? yeah he’s not the one” hahahahahaha rip

7449 2018-07-15 21:53:04 I never argued about maintaining the ascendancy of capital, simply that it is the reality of our system. We live in a capitalist economy, money is power. Elon could take the easy buck and build oil wells, but instead took huge personal risks for solar, space, and electric cars.
7450 2018-07-15 21:53:03 i put peppermint oil on two pimples i have & i can barely open my eyes. it’s so strong..this must be what a mint leaf feels like all the time.

7453 2018-07-15 21:51:51 Brother.   Seriously. “Fox News” is an entertainment channel .... it admitted this in 2015 and again later.  Meaning the stuff they say is bs.  Google.  Do your own research.  You can be conservative but don’t be fooled by assholes selling you snake oil.
7454 2018-07-15 21:51:47 A farmer has a cow, squirts out milk, boil sit, sells it for $4/gal.  Oil company drills 4 oil/gas 1,000 miles beneath the earth, pump it out, put it on a pipeline to a ship, ship it, another pipeline, refine it, truck it, gas stations get their cut and it’s STILL cheaper? How?

And passed out face down wearing a red robe on the front lawn
As cars drove by.
Apparently, my then Dog laid over me.
7460 2018-07-15 21:50:15 Beginning.  There was over 1000 companies making electric cars in the early 1900’s.  Look it up.  Big Oil always wins out.
7461 2018-07-15 21:49:21 I hope France will do it's due diligence because Malaysian #palmoil must be distinguished from simply "palm oil". I am now in Sarawak where 28,000 indigenous small farmers grow oilpalm in mixed crop setting, where it's grown on former rice fields, not forests. Pls come see.
7462 2018-07-15 21:49:20 Coconut oil works really well but dont use heat irons
7463 2018-07-15 21:49:06 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
7464 2018-07-15 21:49:06 Maybe not a top donor, but a donor nevertheless, to the GOP?

We wouldn't be as aghast if it came to light that you were funding the terrorists blowing up oil pipelines. But the #climatedeniers?!?
7465 2018-07-15 21:49:05 Can I mix it with coconut oil ?
7466 2018-07-15 21:49:04 Not for me! White flour is a little hard and baking without oil is a "no go!"
7467 2018-07-15 21:49:00 Coconut oil is Dragon Energy
7468 2018-07-15 21:48:48 Brian, a Majority of Americans  already knew he was a SNAKE OIL SALESMAN....those who are EVOLVED HUMANS..the Ones that Were Fooled are his Base , and therefore Not that EVOLVED..
7469 2018-07-15 21:48:45 It has nothing to do with oil because the industry is also destroyed.
Of course whoever help us will have benefits from that in tbe future.
Welcome.....
I prefer a nice country with USA as a friend that no country as it is now.
7470 2018-07-15 21:48:28 It’s cuz they use the coco butter oil from bath and body works 
7471 2018-07-15 21:48:24 How, then, was Trump "actively serving (Russia's) interest and defend(ing) them at every turn" when he harshly criticized Germany for their oil and gas deal with Russia?
7472 2018-07-15 21:48:23 Charges Drop Against A #FishStick Accused Of Assaulting A chicken Nugget While Teaching Her How To Swim On Hot Oil....#breaking #godblessthemotherland 
7473 2018-07-15 21:47:57 4-5 drops of peppermint oil in a spray bottle. Fill bottle with water and spray around the house once a month. Natural spider repellant. 

Hope you like the smell of peppermint. 
7474 2018-07-15 21:47:34 Musk also donates to Democrats.  The amounts are relatively tiny compared to major car companies, oil companies, etc.
7475 2018-07-15 21:47:10 Because the #SteeleDossier is true. He thinks he will get a 19 percent cut of Russian oil company #Rosneft if he can manage to end #RussiaSanctions 

It’s pretty straight forward. He’s been laundering Russian mob money for years.
7476 2018-07-15 21:47:08 soft skin how to: (if you shave, shave before all of this AND after) hit it with a coconut oil sugar scrub (keep rubbing til your hands feel weird), wash off and then ALSO rub everything down with an exfoliation glove  don’t use hella hot water, and moisturize !!!!!!
7477 2018-07-15 21:47:04 I accidentally got coconut oil on my hair and after washing it I’m a completely new person
7478 2018-07-15 21:46:53 連日、西日本豪雨による災害の復旧作業が報道され、我が町で起こった21年水害の記憶が。当時も連日、暑い日が続き、町中が土ぼこりと災害ゴミの悪臭で酷い状態で、町は１日数回、撒水車を走らせて、かなり解消されました。
  一日も早い復旧をお祈りします。

7479 2018-07-15 21:46:43 The night before my grandmothers funeral, a full bottle of olive oil smashed on our counter randomly followed by a Seltzer bottle falling, and now my aunt just posted that the Lilly's in their garden (one of my grandmother's favorites) haven't bloomed in years & have now bloomed
7480 2018-07-15 21:46:36 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
7481 2018-07-15 21:46:35 #Epilepsy #Panorama If #Cannabis Oil for epilepsy is to be legitimised as a drug for those with seizures that are way out of control etc, then the law has to be rewritten for Cannabis used for recreational uses. This could entail a mammoth amount of work for the legal profession
7482 2018-07-15 21:46:13 No back pain? U use the zadaka product? I am using a cbd oil now for that and not sure if I'm getting the desired relief.  Would try nearly anything to not deal with this daily pain thats next to unbearable .
7483 2018-07-15 21:46:10 I forgot to bring down a cup and plate and the coconut oil...if she finds it I'm not sleeping tonight.
7484 2018-07-15 21:46:09 i think the most bougie thing i do is buy $50 face oil
7485 2018-07-15 21:46:08 Republicans have to suck up to big oil & gas industry at all times, while Dems are generally more pro-environment. If only these issues would get media time. They all seem to be stuck on the same issues 24/7. I appreciate celebs who bring attention to animal welfare. It helps.
7486 2018-07-15 21:45:56 Trump is more concerned that Putin is building a gas line into Europe and trying to replace the sale of oil and gas using US dollars on US Visa and Mastercards with a Russian ATM Mir card.
7487 2018-07-15 21:45:39 If that were true, he would not have Iran paid Iranians, Iraqis, and Afghans fighting for him due to his inability to get enough Syrians to fight for him, no different from the Arrow Cross Regime.  Do you believe people were paid to oust Ceausescu to get access to Romania's oil?
7488 2018-07-15 21:45:06 Doing some art, needing to go get an oil change haha!
7489 2018-07-15 21:44:46 I am going in target... What should i get??? I have Palmers oil on and some of the bum bum body oil.
7490 2018-07-15 21:44:41 Interviewer: tell me your strengths

Me: well, I have a strong capacity for work and few emotional limits. I’m basically a robot

Interviewer: ok wow, that’s great. Any weaknesses?

Me: [i am leaking oil all over the desk]
7491 2018-07-15 21:44:29 I dry very little, as it seems to lose a lot of aroma that way. I mince it (food processor) with olive oil and either make pesto or stick it in silicone ice cube trays. Pop 'em out and put into a container in the freezer. That way I have fresh year 'round.
7492 2018-07-15 21:44:23 1) Kompromat (PeeTape and/or stolen GOP emails?)

2) Laundered oligarch money in campaign contibutions (eg NRA)

3) Half a Trillion  in oil reserves

7494 2018-07-15 21:44:07 I apologise for Allie's rude behavior in insisting on letting you use inferior valve oil and trying to fool Twitter into thinking EMPTY bottles of valve oil have any value
7495 2018-07-15 21:43:50 おはようございます(*^^*)
7496 2018-07-15 21:43:42 When you mix it with coconut oil? did you pour it in , the coconut oil or you just apply them both at the same time ?
7497 2018-07-15 21:43:19 New thing my dog is afraid of: bottle of extra virgin olive oil
7498 2018-07-15 21:43:03 I can't believe Stephanie Beatriz smiled at me from apartment to apartment and now all I want is hot oil noodles

7501 2018-07-15 21:42:16 Leave the parmesan out of it and freeze it in 1/2 cup portions in baggies. Flatten them out and you can stack them in the freezer and take up hardly any space. Put the parmesan & extra olive oil in when you defrost it.

7505 2018-07-15 21:41:03 The sauce is from a local market but I added minced garlic, basil, rosemary & sage and then earth balance butter, olive oil, and the go veggie vegan parm
7506 2018-07-15 21:40:32 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
7507 2018-07-15 21:40:32 I know! I wake up every morning literally feeling like a robot that needs to oil its joints, makes me feel a hundred years old.

Missed you too :'(
7508 2018-07-15 21:40:32 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7511 2018-07-15 21:40:12 なんでテスト前最後の休みまで潰れるんですかね
7512 2018-07-15 21:40:07 We laugh about it, because if you didn’t laugh, you would go crazy. But, can you imagine the 7th largest producer of oil, and they cannot even provide stable power for the country without daily nationwide outages?
7513 2018-07-15 21:40:07 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
7514 2018-07-15 21:40:06 talk and more talk, the economy is in critical condition and the regime is responsible for it, as long as oil money is wasted in Syria and middle east only can get worse.
7515 2018-07-15 21:39:38 Bingo with # 1 being the foundation and the most pernicious “stream of consciousness” ever to befall any minority! #2 Very good point! It fits though as the “standing up 4 the underdog” which re: “Palestinians” is absurd being supported by 1.5bil Muslims & oil money etc etc!
7516 2018-07-15 21:39:34 Slept for 20 hours.
Got hungry and so I ate a little.
Then, now wanna go back to sleep
But the scent in the room disturbs me.
Some kinda massage oil.
I remember something I hate. 
7517 2018-07-15 21:39:26 These girls really clapped when I put oil spray on at the beach 
7518 2018-07-15 21:39:13 studies confirm that that once Trump has a toddler tantrum, a #GOP member secretly dies a slow emotional death
7519 2018-07-15 21:39:09 I am cocktailing Melatonin Valerian root and CBD oil
7520 2018-07-15 21:39:04 That H thing will give amazing flames. Maybe even better than Mad Max or Mad Oil. Stick to EVs
7521 2018-07-15 21:38:59 Perfectly fresh tomatoes of a good variety with some taste to them, and a lovely olive oil are everything. The rest is just personal preference, proper salting and heat.
7522 2018-07-15 21:38:42 How much of baby oil you buying with 1k bra?
7523 2018-07-15 21:38:25 As long as there is Oil and prospects of *personal* enrichment for both men, maps will be on the table. But frankly I am afraid of much more serious threats than that. Trump is a walking grenade and will destroy democracy, he's started. He MUST be contained.
7524 2018-07-15 21:38:14 Healthy Peanut Butter (peanuts only, best if organic) can be a pain. I love it, but it’s really messy if you take it out of the fridge for too long. All the peanut oil rises to the top, and it is impossible to stir. You end up wearing it.
7525 2018-07-15 21:38:13 @profgalloway Is Norway your #5?  Certainly best $T company for local citizens: 
"The first trillion dollar “company” won’t be AAPL or AMZN, instead it’s Norway’s Oil Fund which just passed US$1 trillion! It’s fully owned by Norway’s citizens, of which each owns $192,000."
7526 2018-07-15 21:38:13 Best smells ever.  (in no particular order) 
 . A fresh roll of 5 Flavor Life-Savers
 . Onions and Garlic sauteeing in Olive Oil
  Fresh bag of potato chips. 
 . Roasted peanuts
  Salsa. 
 . Freshly Baked bread.  
  Green Peppers and onions on a pizza. 
 . Italian beef.
7527 2018-07-15 21:38:09 That and covering myself in olive oil and going on a sunbed.
7528 2018-07-15 21:38:04 Or you're dark because you're in the sun (suffering). Yes I'm in the sun but you need to see the skin of these people who are curious about your skin and their own 'regimen'. The look on their faces when I tell them I use only she's moisture and coconut oil... I chuckle mildly 
7529 2018-07-15 21:37:37 Some fried food just tastes of too much oil. I prefer steamed or lightly cooked veggies because then I can taste the veggies.
7530 2018-07-15 21:37:34 marshall used an oil heater to dismantle a bot
7531 2018-07-15 21:37:19 We know our politicians loot and steal money, but we still vote them in. What are we doing as citizens. Im sure Norways oil isnt up to ours, yet see Norway and see Nigeria. Its like comparing Heavern and hell
7532 2018-07-15 21:37:12 I wash my face morning and night with Clinique facial soap and at night  I apply either coconut oil or bio oil after((:
7533 2018-07-15 21:37:07 It is a condition with no cure; natural or otherwise. If it was cured by coconut oil then it wasn’t eczema.
7534 2018-07-15 21:37:03 I’ve got all of it except the lip oil and so far I am absolutely in love with it  100% recommend
7535 2018-07-15 21:36:55 Wowser, what a thing  ... we used to take the children and their children and now their children to the Shed end .. oh my! you made me long for the BLUES they/we had so much fun - GLA LTH
7536 2018-07-15 21:36:45 Cheap Seats: can you believe Trump is trying to make NATO spend more on military and defense? And he told Germany not to buy oil from Russia! Those are our allies!

Also cheap seats: Trump is run by Putin
7537 2018-07-15 21:36:45 Injured in mali while stealing oil for the greedy politicians!
7538 2018-07-15 21:36:32 The sanctions are on Russia to secure oil in the US and cripple Russia's economy because they dropped the dollar. Congress sanctioned them (using legislation warprofiteers wrote for them) under the guise of election meddling.
7539 2018-07-15 21:36:28 Thank you!! This is why we need you on the pop culture beat and not Smug...
7540 2018-07-15 21:36:02 . God says I should get the Malabu oil bloc. Since we are all being stupid
7541 2018-07-15 21:35:53 my new business - let me help you or someone you love!  Read how much CBD oil can help you... go to my website and check it out!

7542 2018-07-15 21:35:41 Like hell.  He wants oil in the arctic circle and thinks he can negotiate it with Putin- someone who deliberately messed with our election.  Are you blind, deaf or stupid?
7543 2018-07-15 21:35:35 I'm not much of a fan of democrats either, but they do tend to be me reliant on facts and tend to advance our nation more, they also tend to stick values a lot more and just be better people in general, also seem far less likely to crawl into bed with oil tycoons.

7546 2018-07-15 21:35:04 Pumpkin wants a second order of the clams in garlic and oil.
7547 2018-07-15 21:35:03 When they put an oil baron in charge of the EPA, did he call?
When they took children away, did he call?
When they opened national parks up for exploitation, did he call?
He's either not calling or "here's my $ so you'll listen" isn't working out.
7548 2018-07-15 21:34:49 likely Helsinki summit be glad-handing like NK, & some vain attempts to forge geo-political links btwn "two misunderstood solitudes".
Russia's only real claim to economic strength are its vast Oil/Gas/Coal/Forestry/Agriculture sectors...so probable some "Cheap Oil for USA" deal.
7549 2018-07-15 21:34:42 our roommates doggy is so scared of thunderstorms and is prescribed an anti-anxiety pill that does nothing, so she feeds her cbd oil now and it works! Yay holistics! (thought I should share)
7550 2018-07-15 21:34:39 What do you know about oil pits and migrating birds?
7551 2018-07-15 21:34:32 If Republicans care about spending why don't they end oil subsidies?
7552 2018-07-15 21:34:21 Look @ that coconut oil doing works
7553 2018-07-15 21:34:18 Ummmm...in my case, that might not work out as well as you’d like...
7554 2018-07-15 21:34:17 Yeah, that's an approach I often do. Basically, you can chunk up any root vegetable, toss with a little oil and then any of your fave spices and then roast for a while. I wanted to do something more Asian flavor this time.
7555 2018-07-15 21:34:14 Says a lot and your garden is getting too much chili oil ™.
7556 2018-07-15 21:33:42 Banana scrub and almond oil >>
7557 2018-07-15 21:33:38 People hate @elonmusk because he wants to change the world. Do you think oil companies aren’t targeting him? They stand to lose a lot. What about power companies? Edison will lose $ too. I’m installing Tesla Solar Panels next month to move away from the power grid.
7558 2018-07-15 21:33:17 The advantageous media and opportunists only refer to the foreign oil workers who are kicked out.
7559 2018-07-15 21:33:05 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
7560 2018-07-15 21:33:00 Play Fallout 1 or/2 greatest games of all time and put these ones to shame. Great that the lore still exists but nothing compares to going to the Oil Rig with 4 humans a Marcus the Super Mutant and a goddam talking Deathclaw
7561 2018-07-15 21:32:59 OK! What’s trump done FOR you? What tax savings are you getting? Is your air & water pollution improving? All I know is that HIS BILLIONAIRES ARE GETTING MILLIONS MORE $ IN TAX REDUCTIONS (MILLIONS)! THEY’RE MAKING BILLIONS ON THEIR OIL & COAL (Dirty fuels) TRUMP’S BRINGING BACK!
7562 2018-07-15 21:32:36 Oil that's drying up fast.
What a small revolution that will be
7563 2018-07-15 21:32:26 Sorry that supposed to say trying to stop the EU from buying oil from Russia!
7564 2018-07-15 21:32:25 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
7565 2018-07-15 21:32:25 Eco styler and coconut oil too
7566 2018-07-15 21:32:18 You listen to too much #Propaganda.  Alternative reality. Quit listening to the angry snake oil salesman and liar Jones. #idiocracy
7567 2018-07-15 21:32:17 James, U appear 2B especially dense.
World oil prices tanked B4 either Notley or Trudeau were elected.
Harper got NO pipelines approved or done- PMJT has accomplished much more.
The rest of the World is changing to alternative to fossil fuels- U blame THAT on them 2?
7568 2018-07-15 21:32:03 He needs to be needa oil change 
7569 2018-07-15 21:32:00 I love the smell of burnt grass and a 40:1 gas/oil 2-stroke fuel mixture in the morning.
7570 2018-07-15 21:31:57 My thoughts:  Electric vehicles a better way.  Buy up closed down gas stations.  Rebuild them similar to oil changing places,  lower level would consist of places to charge batteries
Electric cars under carriage could be
Loosened for battery retrieval. Switch
Dead batteries. Out
7571 2018-07-15 21:31:45 If the motoring public don't like being ripped off by the oil companies and the government. They should stop complaining and start applying pressure on the government, remember you are the largest lobby group in the country. Email your M P today.
7572 2018-07-15 21:31:30 Magnesium, heat, tiger balm, CBD oil.
7573 2018-07-15 21:31:27 How's your olive oil?
7574 2018-07-15 21:31:24 Taxes, guns, oil, and cowboys in Wranglers.
7575 2018-07-15 21:31:22 Wow. I agree with you Tony. How about that criticality being extended to the people working on Manus island or those discussing oil &gas. Or is it only the church you want to protect?
7576 2018-07-15 21:30:46 Maybe almond milk with a spoonful of almond butter thrown in? The coconut milk functions both as a carrier of flavor and as the oil source in a vinaigrette.
7577 2018-07-15 21:30:41 Mood tbh. Lavender oil on my pillow and. Also I. I find it easier to fall asleep when I'm exhausted if I sleep on the floor ._.

7579 2018-07-15 21:30:24 Always great to have the local Board push for safety improvements (squeaky wheel gets the oil etc). That intersection looks pretty hostile for kids walking to school too, so a good candidate for improvement... before somebody gets hurt.

Perfect mentor for me and @harper_evalyn ;-)

You must be kind, you must be witty 
Very sweet and fairly pretty 
Take us on outings, give us treats 
Sing songs, bring sweets
Never be cross or cruel 
Never give us castor oil or gruel
7582 2018-07-15 21:29:54 You first.

7587 2018-07-15 21:29:07 Im fully capable of civil conversation. The “Billions” I am referring to is the amount of money the oil deal Germany struck with Russia...not the population. Or did you not know about that?
7588 2018-07-15 21:29:00 I think Trump is again failing to consider the consequences of disrupting complex and deeply integrated global systems (like that of oil supply). I'm sure Iran could get creative with how it exerts retaliatory pressure on the U.S.
7589 2018-07-15 21:28:50 This ain't it.  Not until they figure out why the older body doesn't create enough of it, or enough of a bunch of other things the younger folks produce lots of.  But you can sell it as a supplement.  $$
7590 2018-07-15 21:28:30 Dear people who make sandwiches for a living,

Can you please put the oil on the bread first, so it soaks in, and not at the end on top of the lettuce so it slides off and makes a mess?

Thanks,
Lover of Common Sense Sandwiches
7591 2018-07-15 21:28:27 For a fraction of what the legacy launch guys were providing. And if EV’s replace our need for Middle East oil, the 2 billion in customer refunds are a bargain vs a trillion in ME wars, 7500 combat losses, 100’s in casualties & clean air
7592 2018-07-15 21:28:26 Hey, I basecoated them Caliban Green, shaded with Nuln oil, a quick tidy up of Caliban green, and then highlighted with Elysian Green.
7593 2018-07-15 21:28:16 (2 of 2) Do you use anything else? I'm already on prescription cream for it since last year, and I take allergy medication daily and use tons of natural / holistic stuff, including usual coconut oil...nothing is working this year. Any ideas to get relief and calm it down?

7595 2018-07-15 21:28:04 Swear I just washed over a gallon of baby oil off my car from yesterday
7596 2018-07-15 21:27:43 I see the BBC is slaying Russia  on the back of Trump and his meeting , we are scared when we leave the EU we can have some cheap Gas /oil and goods .
Russia like the UK people want peace and trade we are all united on that but not our Government because they cannot compete
7597 2018-07-15 21:27:33 Yes she’s the gift that keeps on giving.
7598 2018-07-15 21:27:32 What's the oil giant? Us?
7599 2018-07-15 21:27:25 CBD oil. Works naturally to relieve stress and relax muscles.
7600 2018-07-15 21:27:04 Don’t know if its the excessive amount of CBD oil I’ve consumed blindly today but I just listened to Spacehog’s ‘In the Meantime’ twice.
7601 2018-07-15 21:26:51 Never go off outside thermometer. If you need a link for a decent remote probe let me know. If chicken is dry, brine it, only cook to 155 and oil skin. Any or all 3 tips will help with poultry.
7602 2018-07-15 21:26:38 I hate when doods try to gauge if you wife material from the get. Askin me if I can cook and clean... boyy can you change my oil and fix my plumbing!!! FOH
7603 2018-07-15 21:26:23 In the past, the poverty they shared had a certain sweetness about it. When the end of the day came and they would eat their dinner in silence with the oil lamp between them, there was a secret joy in such simplicity, such retrenchment.
7604 2018-07-15 21:26:18 #oil
7605 2018-07-15 21:26:14 Means more fkn oil spills all over, or bitumen spills...
7606 2018-07-15 21:26:10 Climate solutions (non-fossil fuel energy) would actually mean govs wouldn’t fight wars over oil and land. And individuals wouldn’t be beholden to big corporations or OPEC to survive.  It’s the opposite of what this tweet describes. Also- Cato Inst is $$ by fossil fuel cos.

7609 2018-07-15 21:25:53 It’s better than coconut oil
7610 2018-07-15 21:25:41 I haven’t tried one yet, but I’ll start by infusing it into olive oil and figure it out from there!
7611 2018-07-15 21:25:10 ah the well respected and sourced Breitbart which has no bias of specific agenda in its reporting

i think you are being spoon fed castor oil... but only time will tell
7612 2018-07-15 21:24:52 NL’s offshore oil sector emits 2MT/yr. 292 off-grid communities in Canada emit 1MT. A just transition would protect vulnerable communities, and the small number of diesel plant operator jobs, over the interests of the international oil industry.
7613 2018-07-15 21:24:51 hmmm I see what you’re saying but idk if I would correlate the decline in oil with the increased visibility of fanbases. just a change in consumption that doesn’t cater to that genre like digital sales and radio did.
7614 2018-07-15 21:24:51 right..he is not worthy of  following the elephant ..he should spend time scratching the cat's ass with chigrl  and promoting another subsrciption vendor..bill bullcrap:)  the moron is blocked.

7619 2018-07-15 21:23:55 I'll tell you what will fix Dandruff in twelve hours and make your hair so shiny it reflects light. Apply baby oil to your hair. I mean soak it in it. Wash it out with warm to hot water when you wake up.  IT'll look like a million bucks bro.
7620 2018-07-15 21:23:49 The @PhillyDailyNews  reports a PHENOMENON Salethia Kennedy is being held captive. The inclusion of air strike zones former Mayor Nutter were aware of. This since The 2012 Administration. Also, this woman were gifted jewels, gold and oil that has enemies of The U.S. vying for.

I want to ask you please about the enceint church in Aqaba as it considered one of the oldest in the world. But it's current condition is bad due to the lack of care and maintenance.
Thank you
7624 2018-07-15 21:22:58 Usually make omelettes for breakfast with bell peppers an onions, fried Brussel sprouts are reallly good, or over baking them. Over baked salmon is easy with olive oil and some lemon pepper. Turkey meat patties n stuff. I make alot of random stuff
7625 2018-07-15 21:22:48 I was working on an oil rig.

7629 2018-07-15 21:22:11 I agree.  He created a fiscal crisis and now will be able to claim he’s found a solution if we can just get at that Arctic oil. We’ll all be bigly rich.
7630 2018-07-15 21:22:06 It's not just Zinke selling out our public lands.  GOP, including Natural Resources GOP, value their oil/gas donors more than they value the land or their constituents.
7631 2018-07-15 21:22:02 They need to #FreeRedFawn ASAP because she stood up for her rights to have clean water against a sheriff’s dept that made up lies to gather support, a private security firm (TigerSwan) which had questionable members, the Nat’l Guard, and a Texas based oil corp that ignored laws.
7632 2018-07-15 21:21:32 And here I am with the medicine that stops addiction on the 1st dose. The Extreme oil, cannabis oil concentrated 28:1. So far it has stopped addictions to: Oxy, meth, heroin, cigarettes. Add to that the Holy oil and it heals your body and resets it to default.

7637 2018-07-15 21:20:43 Misplaced my tincture oil at Durt Fest on Saturday morning. Also realized my id card from work was missing but remembered stashing somewhere because it happens & costs $30 to replace.
7638 2018-07-15 21:20:14 He's just trolling the people who claim it's not a Christmas movie.
7639 2018-07-15 21:20:12 If you think this excuse for a president is going to save you, you are misinformed.  He is only after your oil or whatever wealth your country has. Do not believe anything he tells you.
7640 2018-07-15 21:20:00 As an oil industry expert (subsurface where everything has to be ascertained by limited measurements), when 2 different sources indicate the same thing, then.....

I expect similar situations occur in medicine?

7644 2018-07-15 21:19:07 I don't think the MD and ASST are under pressure for pressurising him.

7646 2018-07-15 21:18:43 Do you know what fingerprints are made? With body oil, sweat and dust. Which can easily be rubbed off depending on several conditions in the environment

also depends on if they dusted 

Or what they acutally found the cocaine on. 

The admission was also direct from rose too.
7647 2018-07-15 21:18:41 l’occitane body oil followed by laura mercier coconut body lotion, this combo is crazy expensive but is pure heaven!
7648 2018-07-15 21:18:38 In relation to climate change Trump is little more than an uncomfortable hiccup - who temporarily is making life particularly difficult for some US scientists. I prefer to use him as a catalyst for standing up to ignorant & malevolent bullies, whether Trump or the oil majors.
7649 2018-07-15 21:18:22 Is Alexandria better?
7650 2018-07-15 21:18:17 You use coconut oil to take your make up off?
7651 2018-07-15 21:18:01 You want Nancy Pelosi to live forever?
7652 2018-07-15 21:17:53 How much of his own money has he pumped in and probably lost. The bottom line is he has not enough money to compete in the premiership unfortunately. The quicker an oil man or woman buys that club the better as that is the only way the club will progress.
7653 2018-07-15 21:17:36 I did a coconut oil mask on Monday and I’m doing one again
7654 2018-07-15 21:17:02 I have seen the price of gas. Yes it’s up but it’s always up in summer. Bread same price at my shop rite. Gas and oil are commodities driven by supply and demand. Get the environmentalists out of the to drill for more oil and watch the price plummet .

7666 2018-07-15 21:15:21 Very possible! I have been having a lot of trouble keeping my skin clean and oil free since upping my HRT dosage. I’ve been breaking out, so possibly I got an ear pimple that went to cyst mode.
7667 2018-07-15 21:15:13 I recall watching Harper during the Oil crisis  shrug his shoulders and state, Oil is only 10% of the CDP, threw AB under the Bus, all he wanted from Albertan's was their votes.
7668 2018-07-15 21:15:12 I use a mix similar to this as pasta topping with olive oil & garlic
7669 2018-07-15 21:15:04 And of course the USA only wants to "free the people" and sees danger for the world in countries with a lot of oil. How dumb must one be to fall for such a ridiculously simple manipulation again and again and again....

7687 2018-07-15 21:12:05 in trade. the eu’s massive tariffs on american goods, lack of cooperation for funding NATO, and increasing reliance on russian oil while painting them the enemy of democracy all play into trump’s statement.

7702 2018-07-15 21:09:51 They found a way to squeeze people as if they were making olive oil. Extra Virgin, Virgin,  Pure Olive oil, Pomace and REFINED OLIVE OIL. When you visit Vegas your pretty much classified as Refined...the last squeeze! #squeezeplay thats why locals dont go to the strip anymore.
7703 2018-07-15 21:09:42 Jamaican Black castor oil is the way to go then:(

7708 2018-07-15 21:09:12 63 billion gallons of oil are used every year to supply just the US with plastic water bottles, 90% of which are used once and thrown away.

7711 2018-07-15 21:08:23 US military spending up. NATO spending up. US oil production up. US arms to Ukraine up. Russia sanctions up. Yup is sure looks like Russia won that war ;-)

7725 2018-07-15 21:06:54 yea the us and genie energy are at work in Syria alongside Israel starting war over oil again so in my position and knowing what I do about Assad's tactics and strategy I would have to side with the rebels.

7731 2018-07-15 21:06:11 Sadly we can’t. Rule of our employments that our free speech may be taken as representing our employers. Even though that’s nonsense. As those whose free speech is curtailed we value it. And seek alternate employment in a city devastated by oil price crashes and Brexit threat

7737 2018-07-15 21:05:03 Ikr! Like we can rhink of the ideas but when its time for execution that's when it gets challenging. And damn coloring with pencil is hard. I mostly use water colors, oil paints, acrylics and poster paints.
7738 2018-07-15 21:05:00 Tea tree oil and coconut oil have really helped me especially when I have box braids!

7747 2018-07-15 21:03:48 Ok well now you’ve hit on something I AM something of an expert in; you can’t “cure” eczema. If a bit of coconut oil got rid of it then it wasn’t eczema. I’ve had it my entire life, I was born with it and it isn’t getting cured. It can be managed, not cured.
7748 2018-07-15 21:03:39 Interesting that the same people who oppose clear cutting of the Amazon for soy production, promote the use of palm oil as bio-fuel. In Europe, 6% of all diesel must be palm oil. This has destroyed massive areas of rainforest in Indonesia and Malaysia.

Fixating on the fraction that Elon got leads to 2 possibilities; your motivation wasn’t about taxpayer $, or you’re bad at math. Neither interests me any further

7754 2018-07-15 21:03:15 Yep. We use water/oil based "flood" coolant in *some* operations to create better cutting conditions and wash away chips. For other operations we use a dry "air blast" to just clear the chips out of the way.
7755 2018-07-15 21:03:12 I have locs and this happens to me. Mix a bit of tea tree oil with some olive oil or coconut oil and dab it into your parts

7762 2018-07-15 21:02:40 Some guy changing my oil made a comment about my Yeti coffee mug. I told him to get his fucking hands off my car and I was goi g to get an oil change elsewhere. No more being nice

7770 2018-07-15 21:01:52 Try googling the damage of the mining of crude oil on the African countries
7771 2018-07-15 21:01:50 What is surprising to me is that this didn't start earlier, everything depends on big oil.. You expect more resistance towards the guy whose plan is to make that obsolete. Think about everyone using solar roofs and ride-sharing autonomous electric fleets. Reminds me of DC vs AC
7772 2018-07-15 21:01:50 invest in crude oil
7773 2018-07-15 21:01:41 An oil company promoted some pro-fighter tweet into my timeline. Rather than get engagement they got a block.  Bad ads from bad brands can backfire. Super excited to make the move from #PHEV all electric w/ my next car. 
7774 2018-07-15 21:01:23 In Texas 2015 over 100,000 oilfield workers were laid off while we bought foreign oil. Explain that one. I lost 175k in savings all while Washington did nothing except buy more oil from saudi

7785 2018-07-15 21:00:45 Many things divide the U.S. & Russia, but Trump & Putin are firmly united in their intention to maintain global dominance via oil (& to a lesser degree natural gas).

7787 2018-07-15 21:00:31 Might be wrong, but think all the oil storage in Ireland is owned by a private US company, so presumably the decision to hold some overseas is strategic to not give them a monopoly on storage. Could have misremembered that story though.

7790 2018-07-15 21:00:12 Claims are that rainforest is cut down to grow soy. Most soy goes to monogastric animals, not cattle. The by-products of soy oil production (i.e. meal) ends up in ruminant diets.

7814 2018-07-15 20:57:22 But you know the adverse effect the mining of oil has caused to the communities they reside
7815 2018-07-15 20:57:17 If it’s about the economy, which your supporters will say, why not discuss Russia’s economic stance towards the US? Why not discuss their role in oil and gas prices? Why not, Trump?

7828 2018-07-15 20:55:46 I predicted gas going up last year after the election. Just took a bit longer than expected. As for the people that want to see us drilling in National preserved lands, the US is already the biggest producer of oil. Prices have not gone down because that is not how it works.
7829 2018-07-15 20:55:12 The frequency with which and amount of Bengay, medicated oil and tiger balm I apply on myself daily, you'd think I am very crippled and 60.
7830 2018-07-15 20:55:10 This is exactly how it works. There is no difference between converting solar energy into chemical energy in the form of crude oil and in the form of lithium ion batteries other than the efficiency of the mechanism (organic life vs solar cells).

7863 2018-07-15 20:50:30 Using Olive oil for Philly steak pizzas is good though
7864 2018-07-15 20:50:16 I wish I could remember who told me about adding coconut oil to coffee because I'd like to give them a big smooch.
7865 2018-07-15 20:49:56 The oil in the dressing helps get that char going.  Just FYI.

7869 2018-07-15 20:49:28 Yes. These are the ones that are leaking oil in a Brazil river, poisoning several families.

Good to know the amount of fucks given to them.

I said fucks? I mean dollars. The amount of dollars given.
7870 2018-07-15 20:49:25 Went off today with Master P to look at a Mk1 MX-5. A bit scruffy inside & out but OK for age, all panels straight, sills dealt with and no rust left, underside all looked good & solid, engine bay good & honest, looks lovely, so go to check the oil and... err... none. Oh. #nope
7871 2018-07-15 20:49:22 Orange Guard is a non-chemical insect killer I use around baseboards and doors. Kills spiders and roaches, among other things. Safe enough to animals and humans it can be sprayed on pet bedding. It's citrus oil based.

Bfr you retire you children don finish skull......
7875 2018-07-15 20:48:52 How much $ has Putin offered you and your family if you hand over the keys to the US? It’s all to do with oil, correct? He wants access to oil- that’s where the big $$ are, and you’re handing it to him with your Middle East buddies and “former” SoS. Gonna be tough from prison.
7876 2018-07-15 20:48:52 Just had the worst fried dumpling ever... Taste like dem fry it inna oil dem did a use from last week
7877 2018-07-15 20:48:42 If she rubs beard oil on her inner thighs before coming to bed, you marry that woman.

That's how you take care of each other.
7878 2018-07-15 20:48:34 build kinder morgan. as the pro oil ads say its not about more oil being produced its about selling to anyone? at progressive rates.
7879 2018-07-15 20:48:33 And also used in other pharma products too. My son was given a cream with peanut oil in it and he went into severe reaction at 12 years old never been allergic to nuts before.......when you know it's pretty darn obvious what cause these allergies in humans.
7880 2018-07-15 20:48:32 Das gilt für Frankreich nicht mehr weil Frankreich schon in 2002 raus war. #FRA

7884 2018-07-15 20:48:10 The only liquid bread belongs in is olive oil and balsamic vinegar lol
7885 2018-07-15 20:48:01 I’m not a coffee connoisseur, but I can’t stand Starbucks coffee. I imagine it is what motor oil tastes like. It’s gross.
7886 2018-07-15 20:47:58 It means the line from Arbroath that corrupt Tony Blair moved from Berwick to sell out his countrymen. All for a rich life in London paid by oil companies and media barons ya numpty
7887 2018-07-15 20:47:46 I think I’ve been driving with my oil on 0% for a few weeks now.
7888 2018-07-15 20:47:38 Lewistown, PA here.  Home of the “electric avenue” exit off 322 and a JC Penny.  Place hasn’t been the same since they changed the Hartley’s chips fryer oil. @colleen_eileen @mrsbeasleycpa amirite?!
7889 2018-07-15 20:47:35 Possibly, USA taps into strategic oil reserves,,besides other countries. At least short term price of crude would fall. Expect, President Trump ask Putin increase crude oil output.
7890 2018-07-15 20:47:35 Today on this special occasion I the Captain of Triple X College Mr. Don Juan  grant the Doctorate of pornography to Reham Khan.

What an amazing achievement.

Reham: I dedicate this achievement to my highly intelligent son. Who burned mid night oil and did editing.
7891 2018-07-15 20:47:18 Well don't rely on wind, because that is predicated on gas backup generation when wind doth not blow.  You can leave it in the ground, but buy gas from Qatar instead, but fracking for gas is just a variation on fracking for oil that has been used in the uk successfully for years.
7892 2018-07-15 20:47:04 Also FYI - the smoke point of #avocado oil is one HELL of a lot lower than what they advertise. Bad for me or not, going back to LaTourelle grapeseed oil spray for stovetop cooking.
7893 2018-07-15 20:46:39 So, who WAS that pseudo scientist ? I mean the guy is the BEST snake oil salesman I’ve EVER seen in action. Totally earnest, confident, uttering total nonsense. One for the ages. Everyone should see him. If there’s a Hall of Fame for bullshitters, I’m nominating him.
7894 2018-07-15 20:46:32 I think he has failed in all bussiness he has done.  Now his family has all paid by Russian oil money. It is his family’s financial future that is at stake perhaps?
7895 2018-07-15 20:46:29 
7896 2018-07-15 20:46:12 I make fried chicken all the time. Shallow cast iron pan and then you make the gravy with the oil you used. I love it

7900 2018-07-15 20:46:02 Germany is Russia's captive for buying 20% of their energy from Russia. USA buys 44% of their oil from us, billions of cubic feet of natural gas every year and huge amounts of electricity. They are our captives, they are our energy vassals, we are their landlords.
7901 2018-07-15 20:45:59 Saw 55555 & 22222 today. Universal baptism of the anointing oil of favor.

7903 2018-07-15 20:45:48 It’s is when it’s putting tariffs on our products, then buying gas&oil from Russsia, when they could get it from the country that protect their asses.What the hell is wrong with you. Stop giving money to the Russsians. Hell Obama and Hillary already gave them 20% of our uranium.
7904 2018-07-15 20:45:39 Gaskiya kam
7905 2018-07-15 20:45:25 Well here is a great idea from @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau, let’s increase oil production. They should be ashamed of themselves. Destruction of this environment is on them. Their promises to lead on Climate Change was a big fat lie.
7906 2018-07-15 20:45:13 The only cardiac surgeon they’ll ever need is Jesus and lavender essential oil.

7910 2018-07-15 20:44:17 I’ll oil myself up now
7911 2018-07-15 20:44:17 You gotta put baby oil on them so they can shineeeeee
7912 2018-07-15 20:44:15 I agree he’s an idiot but since when does a cowboy hat represent oil and gas? Someone’s been watching a little too much Dallas
7913 2018-07-15 20:44:04 What have you done to this country, other than depending on oil, handsome chap. Change your mindset,  everybody knows many states are not viable, you that think with only your left cerebral lobe is trying to refute what everyone can see. You trash.
7914 2018-07-15 20:44:00 Wow, in the middle of the flour/sugar/cooking oil aisle having a terrible time at cub foods. I want to be at Target so bad rn. This is bad
7915 2018-07-15 20:43:52 So u no like me abi ,all the good days in ABU haba engineer
7916 2018-07-15 20:43:45 All you want is to align with Putin and try to be in the business of gas and oil. To enrich you and your family not the American people.
7917 2018-07-15 20:43:44 I still can’t believe he had a willing partner. Shudder.

7924 2018-07-15 20:42:10 No one profits more from climate change denialism than traditional combustion engine automakers and oil companies (like hypocrite Exxon). Follow THAT money, prick.
7925 2018-07-15 20:41:58 Looks absolutely amazing......chilli oil just looks beautiful!!! Thanks for the chance x
7926 2018-07-15 20:41:57 Slathered in coconut oil and laying out in the sun I’ve literally never had this much free time since idk when
7927 2018-07-15 20:41:38 Couldn't agree more. I drove myself crazy measuring macros and chasing ketones, guzzling coconut oil. It's fantastic to be free of that. Life is complicated enough so keep food simple.
7928 2018-07-15 20:41:22 Also president Trump put more sanctions then ,president Obama,&president Trump expelled more Russian spies & shut down a Russian consulate in Washington not that far from a Us submarine base! & president Trump is trying the EU from buying oil from russia!
7929 2018-07-15 20:41:19 Those fresh hits of new oil. Bless whoever came up with the idea of thc oil
7930 2018-07-15 20:41:05 Atoh
7931 2018-07-15 20:41:04 I was convinced by @Amazon to never shop on @Amazon again. Counterfeit products (2 pairs of earbuds & an Astro gaming headset) and an already used broke in deep fryer that came complete with crumbs stuck to it and oil residue.
7932 2018-07-15 20:41:03 Oh, that is an essential oil question 
7933 2018-07-15 20:40:47 OK, with spending priorities in mind, where do you stand on supporting Indigenous peoples? I would assume that subject matters to you? If so, that would fly in the face of the many grade school RW comments on this thread. Btw, big business IS the oil and gas biz.
7934 2018-07-15 20:40:43 Coconut oil ya’ life up

7939 2018-07-15 20:40:09 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
7940 2018-07-15 20:39:52 Inflation.inflation.
INFLATION !!!. is my # 1 complaint. Can we just play fair with our economy boom. Everything we buy is not worth the price we pay. Especially oil & gas. Materials auto maintenance & parts. 
Overcharging. Price gouging?. Just say'n. Cuz no one else will.
7941 2018-07-15 20:39:51 Lol. Relax ke. I want to pursue masters in either Intellectual property or oil and gas or most likely criminal and death penalty litigation
7942 2018-07-15 20:39:46 Hehehe 
Ur turn will soon come. Better start doing asusu from now
7943 2018-07-15 20:39:36 I just bought the black castor oil and flaxseed eco styler gel. This gel couldn't hold my hair for shit the last time I tried it, so hopefully it redeems itself.
7944 2018-07-15 20:39:33 Your tripping bro.  I do not know why you support Russia  and Putin so much.  Maybe it has to do with you wanting to get some of that cash  from tax free oil moved from Russia threw Ukraine and Crimea via that pipeline.  After Trump lifts the sanctions of course

7948 2018-07-15 20:39:02 Too bad nobody believes or cares about your opinion based network.Obama oil that head up?
7949 2018-07-15 20:38:59 I'd imagine it pretty much never moves. Oil tanker costs from Netherlands / France to Ireland would be quite minimal in case it was actually ever needed.
7950 2018-07-15 20:38:44 Yes. Using rotating magnetic field. Gasless and oil less. Around 1908-13.
7951 2018-07-15 20:38:29 interesting marketing technique...
 Dr. Joe's Cure All.
Coconut oil does not need the other shit to be good for you.
And adding the other shit makes coconut oil less useable for all the things it could be used for...
can you cook with your product? can u screw with it? 
too much

7956 2018-07-15 20:37:42 I cleaned my room & im doing laundry :-) my lavender oil is making my room smell really good :-)
7957 2018-07-15 20:37:38 So I guess every president previous didn’t do business with the Saudis from selling them jets and tanks to buying their oil yet it was Trump who has made America oil independent with his energy policies and called on our worthless allies to pay their share for us to defend them
7958 2018-07-15 20:37:38 Will... will the CBD oil save the bees?
7959 2018-07-15 20:37:19 WHAT oil, you don't own jack, the Americans own the infrastructure, whisky, there's none left your to drunk to sell it, fish! Haggis! Great to sustain a country. YOU HATE THE ENGLISH SO DO ONE )
7960 2018-07-15 20:37:18 Nope. I'm not bootlicking. I believe in Musk's mission to make our species multiplanetary. He is incessantly attacked because oil companies and UAW want him gone. I believe he has the vision and the drive to make life better for everyone. If you want to hate him for it, go ahead.
7961 2018-07-15 20:36:37 It reheats very well, I would suggest caramelizing the onions with oil instead of butter if you do plan on freezing though,  it will keep the broth from breaking.  
And yes on bread, toast a 1/2 in cut piece of baguette, cut on a bias with olive oil and diced garlic
7962 2018-07-15 20:36:34 Is that what the hot tub is for? He’s filling it with oil and turning the heat to max? OMG.  
7963 2018-07-15 20:36:29 The annoying part is they were all like yasir yaushe zaka kawomana Mata  I left d house fr them kawai
7964 2018-07-15 20:36:05 Complicated. Man City the best team in the league by far, but not trad good. Owned by oil money. Man Utd the Yankees. Liverpool exciting football and literally same owners as Red Sawx.

Chelsea good, Russian owner. Lots of manager turnover. Spurs good. Eternal underdogs.
7965 2018-07-15 20:35:57 So does the sun, our water, car exhaust, oil processing, coal smoke, sugar replacements, and millions of other things.  You must be super busy educating people on the obvious causes.
7966 2018-07-15 20:35:52 oooh yes, a good sugar scrub. I like to mix sugar & olive oil, wash it of with water and that's it  never used charcoal.. maybe I should try it
7967 2018-07-15 20:35:24 We should work for a future where every home & building have solar panels & storage it should be standard, w/ an electric car in the driveway. That's the future, that's how we fight climate change. We should reserve our anger for the oil, coal, & gas billionaires killing Earth.
7968 2018-07-15 20:35:09 I was gonna go get an oil change but I’ll wait until tomorrow.
7969 2018-07-15 20:35:08 Lunch: spinach, strawberries, green onion, carrot, radishes, avocado, mushroom topped with crispy fish and shrimp and homemade dressing. 

It’s so easy to DIY salad dressings!! This was a mix of oil, vinegar, garlic, honey, coconut aminos, and ginger essential oil!
7970 2018-07-15 20:35:00 I know Moogle is spoiled because my family spent the morning making her homemade dog treats and I massaged coconut oil into her coat for about 45 minutes before I gave her a bath.
7971 2018-07-15 20:34:58 So spending billions of taxpayers $$ to buy 65 year old pipeline to keep you and yr buddies in albertastan happy is completely abandoning oil and gas.  @TheoFleury14 few too many hits to the head?
7972 2018-07-15 20:34:58 People really be putting oil on their skin before makeup. I can’t even imagine that for me
7973 2018-07-15 20:34:42 little did they know that the oil came from phytoplankton
7974 2018-07-15 20:34:38 @ken11610829 うらめしや〜
7975 2018-07-15 20:34:20 We're sorry if you were alarmed, Andrew! What you're seeing is actually not peanut based. It's a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging that does resemble peanut butter. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
7976 2018-07-15 20:34:19 Coconut oil, you know how that looks
7977 2018-07-15 20:34:00 it's not that bad, am sure there was water and oil was too hot. 
Use my style, use a napkin to cover .

7979 2018-07-15 20:33:46 I designed a brilliant coffee.

Who knew vanilla flax milk, kerrygold butter, unrefined coconut oil, cinnamon, vanilla extract, cayenne, and cocoa powder was the key?

You can even froth the flax milk and it whips up insanely.

7981 2018-07-15 20:33:27 Meanwhile, Germany & Russia a working together on an  economic relationship of building enormous gas pipeline and help develop Russian oil and gas reserves. This will be cementing the STRATEGIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ALLIANCE of Germany & Russia. Is it time to wake up, America?!
7982 2018-07-15 20:33:21 today I re-upped on castor oil, b12 and kashi bars. I feel whole now.

7986 2018-07-15 20:32:54 Storing our oil reserves outside of Ireland seems daft, due to the amount of fuel required to transport it here in an emergency. And I imagine that that fuel would already be in short supply.
7987 2018-07-15 20:32:44 Saudis are always manipulating the oil markets.
7988 2018-07-15 20:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
7989 2018-07-15 20:32:13 covered myself in coconut oil, feeling alive and snack-like  happy sunday to you too

7997 2018-07-15 20:30:43 Exactly.  With Genie Energy rolling in for oil (likes of Rupert Murdoch, Dick Cheney, and others benefiting from Trump's "deal") in an agreement where Trump tries to portray Putin as a wise capitalist helping to ease the oil problem "created" by Iran, per Trump no less
7998 2018-07-15 20:30:35 it’s one thing naming it virgin oil but to then why is there extra virgin oil what exactly about an oil is so innocent that it’s extra virgin

8002 2018-07-15 20:30:19 What an insulting thing to say. Were you saying that when he gave hundreds of millions re Fort McMurray fire? Or when additional EI benefits were implemented in AB due to low oil prices? Or the tens of millions prairie ranchers got when bovine TB was an issue? Ingrate. #cdnpoli
8003 2018-07-15 20:30:18 What is this super supplement I’m talking about? It’s not fish or krill oil, but it’s a stellar way to get your Omega-3’s phospholipid-bo...

8008 2018-07-15 20:30:01 @MatthewJRudd As we're still requesting, can I nag for Funboy 3's Summertime or Midnight Oil's Beds Are Burning please? Thanks #forgotten80s
8009 2018-07-15 20:30:01 I wish they were just stupid. In fact, their retirement accounts are invested in oil and arms manufacturing. Stupid and greedy.
8010 2018-07-15 20:29:59 10 miles over for an oil change, windshield wipers are awful, and I need a new tire.  adulting sucks
8011 2018-07-15 20:29:46 Ok, who on my friends list bought CBD oil? Where did you get it? Do you see results with it?
8012 2018-07-15 20:29:30 Trump is in the process of bringing Putin down and nobody seems to realize it. All of Putin’s power comes from oil and natural gas he sells to Europe. Trump is trying to get Europe to get their resources from the US. Take that away and Putin becomes powerless and irrelevant.
8013 2018-07-15 20:29:23 It's good.  If they’re in oil, I drain them well first. And I’ll give the chicken just a quick browning and let it cook the rest of the way on top. Of course you have to have tons of cheese.  
8014 2018-07-15 20:29:10 Put a little baby oil on 2 minutes before getting out of the shower. The smell will rinse away, but your skin will be extremely soft all day
8015 2018-07-15 20:29:08 @FIFAWorldCup has way bigger problems to solve. Assuming the aforementioned is a problem. Which it’s not.
8016 2018-07-15 20:28:12 I just found a spider in my bathtub. It went down the drain but I threw peppermint oil all over my bed so I can take a nap in peace.
8017 2018-07-15 20:28:01 Just a mango, a handful of strawberries, almond milk and I add coconut oil to add some fat.
8018 2018-07-15 20:27:58 One also need a reminder that in 2014, Mother Jones reported that 
“Taxpayers currently subsidize the oil industry by as much as $4.8 billion a year, with about half of that going to the big five oil companies—ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP, and ConocoPhillip”
8019 2018-07-15 20:27:43 Any oil should be fine but I love olive oil but I’m still search for the best product .. my next thing will be castor oil
8020 2018-07-15 20:27:15 Wicky up to 2nd. Have to think that a win here is good for him, SPM, Indycar, Honda, Toronto, Canada, Lucas Oil, mankind etc. Etc.
8021 2018-07-15 20:26:54 sounds crazy, but olive oil! There’s videos on YouTube about it lol
8022 2018-07-15 20:26:25 REASON

8023 2018-07-15 20:26:13 Really? Say what you want about Trump but he never has and never will be anyone’s bitch. He’s not gonna go there and offer him a reset button, he’s gonna sit down tell him man to man why he doesn’t want Germany buying oil from them and what he has to do to be on our good side.
8024 2018-07-15 20:26:08 I’ve run out. I need more. Seriously my skin is so bad RN. Just put a sheet mask on and some pixi jasmine oil. Need to be doing this regularly. I’m so bad at remembering to use masks xxx
8025 2018-07-15 20:26:04 Fuck it to hell. Sorry you’re hurting. I can relate to the frustration. If you’re not into pharmaceutical solutions, essence of peppermint oil, mixed with some olive oil can be a soothing topical
8026 2018-07-15 20:25:58 Using the oil reserves creates future pretext to secure oil production.
8027 2018-07-15 20:25:42 come over when you get off. chads here changing his oil
8028 2018-07-15 20:25:35 Ah ouch! I never learn. Three hours in the back yard this afternoon with oil allover my skin. It's cool outside but my skin is still hot and a deep brown/red colour

8031 2018-07-15 20:25:04 shhhhh, don’t tell @cathmckenna or @JustinTrudeau they prefer importing sharia oil from OPEC countries where human rights and environmental rules don’t exist @jkenney @PremierScottMoe @PipelineAction @OilsandsAction @aboutpipelines @OilGasCanada #NEP2 #ClimateBarbie #PMGump
8032 2018-07-15 20:24:53 guess who stained her jeans with oil while eating out
8033 2018-07-15 20:24:50 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
8034 2018-07-15 20:24:41 Arrogance ? He was 18 years old and demanded more than 15 million euros in salary, dont blame Perez for that , It's oil clubs that have ruined the market.
8035 2018-07-15 20:24:41 We only get an oil bonus over 42% so the drier the better! Only limits on receival are moisture (8% max), test weight (62kg/Hl) and impurities (3%).

I think your crushers are TTP!
8036 2018-07-15 20:24:39 Nah not a big fan of used, people mistreat the fuck outta vehicles & run them without oil
8037 2018-07-15 20:24:38 You say you hate Obama? Why? You say...Democrat? He wasn't even the demacratiest democrat President?!?! "Deporter in Chief" and all those oil lines...come on now...own it...you're racist!
8038 2018-07-15 20:24:18 
8039 2018-07-15 20:23:58 If ignorance would squeak, these young people need an oil can to carry around. Painful to watch.
8040 2018-07-15 20:23:52 In other words, MARXISM!  The ideology of "free" shit and a utopia by force at the end of the government's gun and an unarmed population.  Congratulations!  You are defending the murder of well over 100 million people for the sale of the same snake oil.
8041 2018-07-15 20:23:44 Tried oil pulling with coconut oil this evening and...  but Imma give it another go
8042 2018-07-15 20:23:42 Until then bruh 
8043 2018-07-15 20:23:40 I've been keeping track of it also! Shocking to see 
8044 2018-07-15 20:23:38 Who wants to cover my plump milk chocolate cocoa booty in baby oil then smack it?

#SinfulSunday
8045 2018-07-15 20:23:36 Palm oil production involves rainforest deforestation causing the destruction of animal habitats, resulting in their deaths. As vegans adhere to a compassionate lifestyle, only organic/harvested palm oil is deemed vegan > harvested vs. deforestation.
8046 2018-07-15 20:23:31 Any specific oil ? Or any oil is fine ?
8047 2018-07-15 20:23:10 Schnitzel is fair enough, but you could also have had olive oil - they have buckets of it, and very nice it is too. You could mop it up with the French stick very much as the French did the Croationists.
8048 2018-07-15 20:23:09 beard shampoo/oil is crucial, especially for that itch. throw in some wax if it’s longer
8049 2018-07-15 20:23:05 Your 68 years old!?  Oil of Olay Award!  Trump looks 30 years older. At least.
8050 2018-07-15 20:22:31 Movies are art. Pro Wrestling (I’m saying this as a fan) is Jerry Springer with body oil.
8051 2018-07-15 20:22:25 Worked out. Meal prepped. Laundry’ed. Cleaned house. Car washed. Car filled. Oil changed. Library’ed. Done. #adulting #sundaze

8057 2018-07-15 20:21:25 I’m also partial to bread with a good olive oil and vinegars. Just eaten a huge roast dinner but making myself crave bread  now 
#Luciversary #LuciferOnNetflix
8058 2018-07-15 20:21:19 Since the internet is momentarily back and who knows for how long, the world needs to know about #Basra and the cruel acts that are being done against the citizens of basra, all for the sake of that filthy oil.
8059 2018-07-15 20:21:16 I agree. He was a great teacher too. I had many years of art while in school and still, it was from watching Bob Ross that I learned how to properly  prep a canvas for oil.
8060 2018-07-15 20:21:11 Lol who b that
8061 2018-07-15 20:20:58 I roast my brussel sprouts with garlic, s and p with a little oil until tender with a bit of char. My favourite veg. I have 8 plants on the go
8062 2018-07-15 20:20:56 @PolitiFact 
Allison Graves on Florida This Week (excellent input) mentioned researching this week private vs public beach access.
I’am aware of at least 3 public stances Rick Scott appears to have flipped flopped on this year. Off shore oil drilling, Gun ownership age, beaches.
8063 2018-07-15 20:20:54 If I see one. Who knows that Pesky Pete or some else might beat me to it.
8064 2018-07-15 20:20:47 Why so curious? Oil your own machine..

8072 2018-07-15 20:20:06 Not from our experience last night. So disappointing. Oil literally pouring out 
8073 2018-07-15 20:20:03 We are very healthy, we never use a lot of oil....lol, we make sure the pressure is low so that we are not stressed and we never eat #ice scream or any junk food. We so healthy. 
8074 2018-07-15 20:19:56 Uhh the guy who wants his Fed government to buy a pipeline is against oil and gas?
8075 2018-07-15 20:19:55 Syria.  A brutal dictator suppressing a people's rebellion that was coopted by people coming from outside of Syria to create ISIS to create a fundamentalist caliphate.  With Russia backing Asange for oil rights and the US tripped up supporting the rebels and civilians.
8076 2018-07-15 20:19:42 So if it wasn't racist calling her ugly you won't have an issue with me saying When I first saw you I thought of funny looking Olive Oil from the old Popeye cartoon. #eaturspinach

8078 2018-07-15 20:19:28 It's also time for us to turn the taps off oil & water for a while, and see how long Trump's golfing while America burns can continue.
8079 2018-07-15 20:19:22 The purpose of the #Trump-#Putin meeting is for Putin to reinforce the BLACKMAIL.

The message from PUTIN to Trump will be clear: lift sanctions, turn a
blind eye to corruption, keep buying oil, & act in favor of Russia --

OR ELSE. "Play along or I'll expose you." @thehill @CNN
8080 2018-07-15 20:19:16 You just made me go "Ahhh"

8089 2018-07-15 20:18:10 Oil comes out of the ground, nobody owns it. Just as illogical...
8090 2018-07-15 20:17:55 John found his time drilling for oil lucrative but boring ...
8091 2018-07-15 20:17:54 I'll even put the apprentice tune on the video for you heid if I see one :)
8092 2018-07-15 20:17:50 Kosher salt and fresh cracked is the rub. Then slathered in yellow mustard and in the fridge for 12 hours. 8 hours untouched on the Bullet, then mopped with a little apple juice, cider vinegar and olive oil. Only 2 mops at 8 hours and then when it breaks the stall

They're both Russian plants
8096 2018-07-15 20:16:52 I wonder if Trump will resign after sanctions are lifted and he gets his 19% of Rofsnet (sp)....the huge Russian Oil company.
8097 2018-07-15 20:16:50 Coconut oil for the waves
8098 2018-07-15 20:16:32 lizzo truth hurts, good as hell or coconut oil

8100 2018-07-15 20:15:53 Measure three tablespoons of olive oil into it.
8101 2018-07-15 20:15:44 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
8102 2018-07-15 20:15:41 Your skin will take a little getting used too for new skin care products, but also make sure you’re buying stuff that matches your skins oil levels !!
8103 2018-07-15 20:15:40 There's not even a million of them. I bet Putin could be like "I'll ship you all the ANWR oil and Donald Jr can shoot a polar bear. It would make liberals crazy" and the deal would be done

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
8105 2018-07-15 20:15:38 I should go buy sage oil, that brings on labour apparently
8106 2018-07-15 20:15:37 You can’t go back in time anymore. I know how you feel ‘cause I also feel the same but trust me. You just can’t fine the inspiration yet and feel lonely ‘cause of time space between age. So don’t worry you’ll be fine. When your college opens up you’ll busy ‘till forget that feel.
8107 2018-07-15 20:15:29 In the late 1800's, whale oil was the primary source of lubricant that kept the worlds industry going. The commercial availability of crud oil saved whales from extinction.

 and now we wait
8118 2018-07-15 20:13:54 I’ve found roasting cubed eggplant or mushrooms for a good while with some oil and salt, slightly burning them, concentrates their umami flavours and make them chewy in a way that pushes similar buttons. Doesn’t pretend to be anything else, just tasty!
8119 2018-07-15 20:13:45 You might wanna get your oil % gauge checked too cuz it’s probably broke
8120 2018-07-15 20:13:42 the aggressive up selling 19 y/o at the oil change place nearly made me cry if u are wondering how i’m handling the heat today

8125 2018-07-15 20:12:18 Guess u never heard of America’s interference in Latin America and every oil producing country
8126 2018-07-15 20:12:14 Just heat it and stir often. Bisques usually have a lot of oil suspended in it.

8130 2018-07-15 20:11:35 Caster oil is amazing it also helps hair growth!! I use a small couple drops in my conditioner 
8131 2018-07-15 20:11:33 Gave up sugar, red meat, white flour, alcohol  & oil for two weeks. 
It was like hell but I’ve recovered.
8132 2018-07-15 20:11:32 No Bob. The Europeans R doing what they've been doing with your coffee, oil &minerals - you export "raw materials" (footballers), they create high value products from them, and re-export to us to claim them as the World Cup winning "African Team". #FRACRO #WorldCupFinal
8133 2018-07-15 20:11:30 >> middle of nowhere, just to steal a car or anything else from #Jack’s land. Unless they had a death, wish or didn’t know what was good for them. Opening the door, and not really caring for the noise that was being made by the lack of oil on the door hinges, I pulled my pain >>
8134 2018-07-15 20:11:28 TO THE RIGHT OF POLAND..ITS ABOUT OIL...FISH AND FISH OIL...SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT DON DOES WITH PUTIN...I THINK PUTINS ECONOMY WITH OIL PRICES RISING NOW ALONG WITH OTHER COUNTRIES ALONG HIS BORDER ..ARE MORE STABLE NOW THEN US AND EUROPE ECONOMICALLY

8138 2018-07-15 20:10:38 Also in 1993, the Australian rock band Midnight Oil played a free concert in a field of tree stumps at Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The show was part of a protest over what lead singer Peter Garrett called the “massacre” of B-C’s ancient rain forests.
8139 2018-07-15 20:10:26 Scotland is a big exporter of beef, lamb, fish, seafood, oil & gas , chemicals, petroleum products , electronics, textiles and whisky. Those are the ones that I know about, as I used to work in the export/import industry.
8140 2018-07-15 20:10:25 I feel like all women should know how to change a tire and change oil.
8141 2018-07-15 20:10:24 What I thought was a sealed Tupperware leaked sardine oil all over my ipad. Huh. :|
8142 2018-07-15 20:10:18 Eastern Ukraine, and the oil pipeline use can also be big Russian wins now
8143 2018-07-15 20:10:09 My dumbass brother thinks that if you had a castle 50 ft up and poured boiling oil from the top of that castle, that the victim receiving the oil would be just fine. His argument then turned into 'your not a scientist! You don't know about moisture' touche douchebag #Fuckingtards

8147 2018-07-15 20:09:24 Plus one. No more body oil and natural light. Instagram referrals instead. “See the attachment link..”
8148 2018-07-15 20:09:23 Conned by a cheap snake oil salesman with the shitest combover ever seen in public, it's highly unbelievable, innit?

#championsusechampion
8150 2018-07-15 20:09:13 Yes! Stabilize oil of Olay price!!
8151 2018-07-15 20:09:03 A crude oil trace on the glass is a must.
8152 2018-07-15 20:09:02 I bought a frozen lobster bisque soup

And I defrosted it, and it's a pool of oil and it smells like cookie dough I'm ultra confused.
8153 2018-07-15 20:08:46 If Trump were “compromised” or in Putin’s pocket, why on earth would he be so derogatory towards Merkel’s deal with Putin? If he were colluding with the Russians, he would have applauded the oil deal.
8154 2018-07-15 20:08:04 So if your son showers even every other day he'll never even experience it. It's as natural as oil in your hair or grime under your fingernails or morning breath - and just as easy to be rid of.

This is what you're considering cutting a piece of his body off to avoid. 
8155 2018-07-15 20:07:53 We need a floating dynamic gas tax that changes with the price of oil.
8156 2018-07-15 20:07:52 Truman met w/Joseph Stalin & Churchill in Potsdam Germany July 1945.
FDR met w/ Stalin & Churchill in Feb 1945 in Crimea. FDR embargoed sale of oil to Jap 1940, hence Pearl Harbor.
 Hirohito wouldn't have met w/FDR.
8157 2018-07-15 20:07:36 Hi. If you take 2000 mg of EPA a day (found in fish oil) it literally has the same effect as antidepressants. And you can get them at any vitamin world or store that sells vits. There is a TED talk on it.
8158 2018-07-15 20:07:25 My boyfriend got me coconut oil the other day and im still not over it.  I Never tried it on my hair and its amaziiingggg
8159 2018-07-15 20:07:25 寝れないと死んじゃうよぉ！
8160 2018-07-15 20:07:22 Is there oil there? If there is, your nasty ass “leader” will disrupt the silence with all the trucks and drilling he’ll allow. That guy has no purpose on this earth except to shill for energy companies. And that ain’t a purpose, that’s a disorder.
8161 2018-07-15 20:07:06 ليه انشالله ... 
8162 2018-07-15 20:06:53 Daman haka ake kawo kayan sa rana kamar Lefen aure kuche akwai aiki jaa dake jirana
8163 2018-07-15 20:06:50 Countdown to "my Twitter feed was hacked by the oil companies" in 5, 4, 3 ...
8164 2018-07-15 20:06:47 The thing about the 10 Virgins parable is they _all_ started with oil.

It’s not enough to “only spend what you earn (or have).”

The resource-mgmt lesson is:

earn -> hold a buffer -> earn more -> spend w/o diminishing the buffer
8165 2018-07-15 20:06:43 Pretty much! Thicker skin and more mallowy centre. I like to soften in olive oil and add garlic and chilli, lots of herbs. Also going to try and make Marrow Rum 
8166 2018-07-15 20:06:39 Castor oil is honestly a blessing. It makes my lashes grow sooo quick!!!
8167 2018-07-15 20:06:31 1. Your way off on the 99%,in my area alone I can name a dozen schools with nsca or cscca certified S&C coaches.
2. Plenty of low quality & dangerous personal trainers our there selling snake oil.
3. Entire point of this was not to trash PT, it was to put your team first
8168 2018-07-15 20:06:30 They might. And do they call for a public uprise against Big Oil like @elonmusk did? #Hypocrite
8169 2018-07-15 20:06:25 Watch your f’ing language; I am sensitive.
8170 2018-07-15 20:06:12 No one is interested in snake oil science.
8171 2018-07-15 20:06:07 boy, that's th'truth. lol

8174 2018-07-15 20:05:54 U ever put peppermint essential oil on your nipples? It’s truly a sensation unmatched by any other
8175 2018-07-15 20:05:38 اه ممكن تكون عشان هو عايز يروح يقعد ع القهوه او الكافيه مع صحابه .. وهي مش عايزه 
8176 2018-07-15 20:05:35 <Dorota to make truffle oil popcorn.
8177 2018-07-15 20:05:25 @CBCNews now the government is shutting down our park's for oil corporation's.time to vote left and get rid of corporate stooges

8182 2018-07-15 20:05:00 Fun fact: Vape Pens with weed oil or butter or whatever in it works. A lot.
8183 2018-07-15 20:04:56 You wouldn't think there is a lot but your mistaken, the ocean drilling for oil obtains tonnages that are sent through the pipeline, it makes tonnages of Natural Gas, their complaint is that they pay for the hot water clean out and the gas as well. That costs more than US NatGas.
8184 2018-07-15 20:04:35 @BlackOrchid_BBO omfg I love my honey green tea scrub and oil so much!!! @simonefiasco you really did that! Also I would love to send you some lookbooks to show my appreciation 
8185 2018-07-15 20:04:33 We can't be telling ourselves lies and progress as a nation. Even with favourable crude oil price things are still the way they are now. People are suffering here you hear.
8186 2018-07-15 20:04:22 @Pokediger1 When ur bad at fornite and your car breaks down because of oil
8187 2018-07-15 20:04:20 Just almost fell into the lake off the boat due to the amount of tanning oil on my body #thebestkindofproblems #slipperywhenwet

8191 2018-07-15 20:03:41 Wish my coconut oil would firm up so I can start phase 3 of the 2018 glo’ up 
8192 2018-07-15 20:03:34 I find more and more the complaining about the complaining about overpays are  decreasing as the realization of how bad the Oilers cap situation is and every extra $ spent on 4th liners and bottom pair D are killers.

8194 2018-07-15 20:03:25 David, thanks for the support It’s important to note that it is Governments, through IMO, that have mandated the new lower sulphur requirement for ships’ fuel oil.
8195 2018-07-15 20:03:25 like walking around with my hands like a fucking orangutan huge.  Like throw a 55gal full drum of oil over the golden gate bridge yoked.  Like, juiced bra
8196 2018-07-15 20:03:20 Ororo, Anointing oil..... omo sheyen.
8197 2018-07-15 20:03:13 Anyone else feel relieved in a way after you get your oil changed? Cuz I always do
8198 2018-07-15 20:03:12 We need the pipeline because how else are we going to continue to pay for all this crap without it being in the backs of taxpayers.  We already have the strictest clean laws there are.  We are a resource based country and Russia helped protest our oil so they could sell THEIRS!
8199 2018-07-15 20:03:07 A random question but gas or oil?
8200 2018-07-15 20:03:07 YAH gives us the oil of gladness instead of mourning. Psalm 149:4; 132:16;  Isaiah 61:3. #WorldCupFinal
8201 2018-07-15 20:03:02 Whatever your GOP propaganda claims, you have in fact delivered to most Americans: 

Higher taxes
Higher insurance premiums
Higher oil prices 
Higher national debt
Higher income inequality 

You work for the 1%.

8203 2018-07-15 20:02:44 Thatcher sold the country down the road every thing she could sell she sold including the oil, how radical is that. She started the deregulation of the financial sector, hence the 2008 crash.

8207 2018-07-15 20:01:49 US to UN: Cut off North Korea’s oil supplies:  We could have told you that Kim J-u is going to continue with his quest for personal supremacy!  He put on a good show at his meet with Trump, that's about all!
8208 2018-07-15 20:01:37 Playing politics with the environment is just a loss for all . Clearly this is just big oil at it again
8209 2018-07-15 20:01:24 Natural Gas from Russia to Europe comes in their pipeline. What happens in the oil pipeline Calcium Hydrate is a undesired byproduct that clogs the oil pipeline but Russia uses hot water to wash it from the pipeline periodically and it forms Natural Gas Russia sells back to them.
8210 2018-07-15 20:01:23 You absolutely nothing about me, my large foreheaded friend.  There is however a great deal of information by/about Peterson.  He’s only about the money....enjoy your snake oil.

8225 2018-07-15 19:59:48 Trump opened up our national parks to his oil drilling and Fracking billionaire friends. Maybe start there
8226 2018-07-15 19:59:47 .im devastated . I just ruined my hair oil mixture.
8227 2018-07-15 19:59:37 should have traded him then to a sucker =)
8228 2018-07-15 19:59:34 And what about the gasoline prices? Evertime you #Republicans do tax cuts gas prices go up! Remember that Bush tax cuts during the war? I do, $4.00 market crisis and 12% unemployment. I REMEMBER! By the way, where's the #Iraqi oil to pay for the war.
8229 2018-07-15 19:59:06 Often anecdotal examples are used to support a policy that is detrimental in the macro. Ppl like her benefit as well as the generational welfare recipients, drug dealers and other general parasites. Moving to a less expensive area prob better overall
8230 2018-07-15 19:58:30 We haven't seen her yet.
8231 2018-07-15 19:58:27 I would agree with you but when a guy his age scores 13 times in 67 games and has his wheels, many a GM would pay what they did. #silly
8232 2018-07-15 19:58:12 Good! I hope Pres Trump tells Putin to stay OUT of this hemisphere. Tell him to get OUT of Venezuela and to forget about his plan to control its economy and THE LARGEST OIL RESERVES IN THE WORLD (hint) Maybe the US should make sure such resources don't fall into the wrong hands!?
8233 2018-07-15 19:58:09 After seeing how that guy behaved on the stand I refuse to believe he has ever engaged in sex with a woman.
8234 2018-07-15 19:58:08 Putin has taken back oil companies from oiligarchs and mining companies and given nothing back to the Russian people,he has murdered people, he has had people poisoned that have dared to cross him, and you say he’s a good leader.He makes Trump look like a flipping angel!!

8246 2018-07-15 19:56:45 Talk to @canna_brain - my part-Roma ass wears tanning oil and maybe a 15 on my face sometimes (for anti-aging purposes) 
8247 2018-07-15 19:56:24 The squeaky wheel gets the most oil.  Not so much anymore.  Trump calls them out and we have finally found our voice.  They will hear us at the polls.  No excuses.... VOTE.

8250 2018-07-15 19:55:58 I’m just loving the sheer denial of the oil lobby. Your time has passed and I have NO sympathy
8251 2018-07-15 19:55:34 Store in cool dark space for both. I have previously preserved the garlic cloves in oil, lasts for a very long time. Stems on for plaiting if so inclined, or cut shorter.

8265 2018-07-15 19:53:51 The queen would be so honored to have your nose in her old bum. But do you honestly believe that the “royal family” gives two f***s about us peasants?

8276 2018-07-15 19:51:39 There wouldn't be a need for any billionaire Jesus to fix climate change if oil barons worried about their investment didn't buy the US government, mostly through the right.

The US could have done everything Musk had thirty years ago if not for the Republicans.
8277 2018-07-15 19:51:27 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.

8285 2018-07-15 19:50:28 Congress is doing nothing.  Now is our time.  We cannot let our beloved country be destroyed by a New York snake oil salesman.
8286 2018-07-15 19:50:26 You really don’t get it at all do you? Are NATO members now agreeing to pay their full share? Would he have been so harsh to Merkel about the oil if he were in Putin’s pocket? Try thinking rationally rather than jumping on the hate bandwagon.
8287 2018-07-15 19:50:15 We give our dog hemp oil treats to calm him down during thunderstorms. I'm sure you don't care, just thought I would share......and now I'm a poet
8288 2018-07-15 19:50:12 Oh FFS Theo it's the damn Stampede. I've never ridden a horse or worked in an oil patch and you're telling me I have no right to wear a frigging cowboy hat.  Give it a rest
8289 2018-07-15 19:50:11 Sever consequences.  Like what pal? Sanctions? Little hard to do when the EU  depends on Russian oil.
  I don't think geopolitics is YOUR tbing.
8290 2018-07-15 19:50:07 I know this is petty in the grand scheme of things, and God knows I'm no oil painting myself, but: What the fuck is up with Brett Kavanaugh's face?
8291 2018-07-15 19:50:05 This creature is feared by my other factory clones we hide to not die he always steal oil and water if we try to stop him he kill us I lost one of my favorite clones he absorbed his water sadly died.
8292 2018-07-15 19:49:58 You mean he's not like Barak?
Telling the other side exactly what his plan is.

Shocking
8293 2018-07-15 19:49:51 The link mentions forthcoming results involving olive oil and lard. Have you seen a follow-up report?
8294 2018-07-15 19:49:46 I love it - what's not to like? Fresh green veg, cheese, eggs, olive oil, avocados, unprocessed meats, natural yoghurt, a few nuts and seeds. Trying to move my whole family onto it. Gradually cleaning up their diet without them noticing.
8295 2018-07-15 19:49:37 they're sniffing oil now

8301 2018-07-15 19:49:03 I put on my socks first I want my feet to stay soft n hydrated with that coconut oil 
8302 2018-07-15 19:48:49 Putin and trump are partners in an international criminal enterprise. They want not only to control the world's oil but also grab the world's wealth using USA resources to achieve their goal
8303 2018-07-15 19:48:42 Do better bro a little castor oil and hair stimulation can go a long way  just a little advice
8304 2018-07-15 19:48:40 Perhaps the republican party really IS Russian bots and this one's wiring's gone bad... You have to admit: It would explain A LOT, including that weird oil slick on Ted Cruz's face...
8305 2018-07-15 19:48:31 Finally getting my oil changed after riding around for 5 hours slim... I’m so annoyed and haven’t eaten all day, I’m still sleepy, my body hurt and I just want good as pasta a jay and a nap.

8309 2018-07-15 19:47:50 So is that why Germany is getting all that Russian gas and oil — because it’s a such a pariah?
8310 2018-07-15 19:47:39 Try using coconut oil!
8311 2018-07-15 19:47:30 The oil pipelines would be decorated for Pride month
8312 2018-07-15 19:47:18 Dear Morlock a/k/a purple seal: Trump’s a tool of the Ru mob. They don’t run market economies. You’re gaslighting 4 kleptocratic, anti-democratic, anti-social, anti-healthcare, anti-environmental, pro-coal/gas/oil/tar/shale kabal of TrumpRosneft shareholders attack’g Democracy.

8314 2018-07-15 19:47:10 Repubs are always going to be opposed to clean energy. Unless he outfunds all coal & oil combined, he's not at the front of that line. It's protection money, & he likes sponging tax breaks.
8315 2018-07-15 19:46:43 I need the get an oil change but I also don’t need to spend any money until after pay day. Hmn
8316 2018-07-15 19:46:30 My biggest take from this tweet is za fact that Fekir will sign for Liverpool
8317 2018-07-15 19:46:30 Can’t fight fire wit fire 
We can’t see eye to eye
We’re just like oil & water
Can’t mix to save our lives
8318 2018-07-15 19:46:10 I reckon you are one of they communist revolting types Joyce.
We can't be having that sort of stuff!
It might get people thinking.
That would give them ideas
Then they would see that our stuff is snake oil
And worst of all the unwashed would end up eating our buffets
8319 2018-07-15 19:45:55 Guess the Ceeementt pond ain't broke no more?? Can only imagine the oil slick jenelles 5 head leaves , can't enjoy the pool without jamming the phone in a kids face , even in the ceeeement pond lmao
8320 2018-07-15 19:45:55 @snugglebeard How did I say that? He he created reusable rockets which took a long time. Tesla's progress is slow because of the stupid government favoring big oil. SpaceX progressed faster because the govt supported them, not so much with Tesla.
8321 2018-07-15 19:45:55 Check your Engine oil today.
8322 2018-07-15 19:45:46 Considering the term they got Leon on, that part I can live with...even though it was an overpay. The Pouliot buyout, Russell deal, and others you mentioned are issues. Though the market dictates Caggiula isn't much of an overpay, would've been better suited by moving the asset.

8324 2018-07-15 19:45:40 Hey, you can do it, too! Just need a few bucks and add water. When I started diving, learned his "silent sea" was no more with ship traffic, active military & commercial sonars everywhere, air gun oil/gas exploration blasts, and... snapping shrimp. 
8325 2018-07-15 19:45:39 It’s simpler than that. Oil is a commodity. Ripple ain’t.
8326 2018-07-15 19:45:35 who has oil cartridges ???
8327 2018-07-15 19:45:35 These ppl are shocked an American President would bluntly call them out in public for duplicitous behavior and taking U.S for granted. Unless cornered into it, used to doing least possible.

8331 2018-07-15 19:45:04 It's all a drama to stay away from the bad name after announcing Oil price hike.

8337 2018-07-15 19:44:05 For 16 years, things were 'affordable' with the aid of a voodoo Economy that lacked substance.

Didn't we all see the underbelly of that economy when oil prices sharply dropped?
8338 2018-07-15 19:43:56 I pakai aurora oil utk kuatkan akar rmbut  korg bleh tgk ig diorg @auroraoilmurah , i beli waktu promo hritu
8339 2018-07-15 19:43:44 What country doesn’t have mismanagement and corruption? How do you specifically attribute it to communism? And most other oil producers did feel significant pain, but they were conveniently backed by the US
8340 2018-07-15 19:43:38 Yes we need to stabilize Oil of Old Lady.. I mean Olay prices. You can’t afford to buy that shit without a double coupon..
8341 2018-07-15 19:43:11 If @elonmusk is not a prime example of someone going against their best interests, I am not sure what is. Republicans are pro big business and pro oil, anti new energy technology. What is it your company is known for Elon?

8344 2018-07-15 19:42:45 What @PutinRF_Eng and @realDonaldTrump have in common are the oil reserves in Siberia. They both need the sanctions on Russia to be lifted so they have the capital to develop this area. Money is the driver.
8345 2018-07-15 19:42:45 40 mins later and still waiting for an oil change. @pepboysauto is the absolute worse.

8349 2018-07-15 19:42:05 Of course rent control is a burden. My aunt lived under rent control in Queens. In her 80s and living alone she was living off social security and a government pension. She had worked for the city as a nutritionist. Is she one of the dead beat you would want kicked out?
8350 2018-07-15 19:42:04 My Morris used more oil than petrol. I sold it for £15 when I was 18 and went to university.
8351 2018-07-15 19:41:57 Ppl if you look up "how to change oil" promise you'll never pay for it again.
8352 2018-07-15 19:41:47 I do chuckle at how many are just coming to this realization this off-season.

8375 2018-07-15 19:38:54 You’re not very bright are you? We got our oil and gas from the Middle East for many decades it wasn’t until the Obama administration that we became energy self-sufficient. Trump is despised and hated in the world because he’s a stupid and dangerous Puppet of Putin and Russia.

8397 2018-07-15 19:36:44 No mystery.... In my opinion.. They will be talking real estate and maybe sanctions and oil.

8401 2018-07-15 19:35:56 The meme fails to mention the £18bn of reserved spend on social protection. And defence. And international spend.

What measure is your oil revenue supposition based on? And which revenue from exports do you mean?
8402 2018-07-15 19:35:48 As for large political lobby groups, yes, things like AIPAC are strong but so are the NRA, the oil industry and even the Saudis (among others).
Do you have a problem with gun lobbyists?

8410 2018-07-15 19:34:42 Qatar's investment plan is very impressive the defining factor between them and other Gas and Oil Countries.
8411 2018-07-15 19:34:34 Not sure what you mean by "integrate" with oil Arabs. The Arabs are at best, allies of convenience, who will do whatever is in their interest at any given time. The "Palestinian problem" is an excuse used by Arabs since 1967. None of them give a damn about the Palestinians.
8412 2018-07-15 19:33:45 You are an idiot. 

When it's time to retire EV. Then what. 

Also you ev is created using oil. 

Check out the resources to create battery. 

Also leave Toronto and go to Sault saint Marie.  

You ev is inefficient. And useless.

but we'll all pop!!
8416 2018-07-15 19:33:25 You put everything on a pan, drizzle it in olive oil and whatever seasonings u want, and put it in the oven for like 10–15 minutes it’s so EASY
8417 2018-07-15 19:33:25 Bruschetta with lemon thyme is on the menu today but I have not decided on what type of vinaigrette I will be using. Maybe d'anjou pear white balsamic. But I have raspberry, blueberry, and vanilla fig (!!!) balsamics. Might do lemon meyer olive oil but, too much lemon??
8418 2018-07-15 19:33:06 Femi, forget this country. Visionless and clueless leaders everywhere. 20 years from now, we’ll be begging them for good roads and electricity. We’ve also got the same oil like Norway but ours is a curse.

8420 2018-07-15 19:32:48 For the grill, I prefer a simple dressing of olive oil, freshly cracked black pepper, and some smoked salt plus some spice to finish; what do you usually use?
8421 2018-07-15 19:32:26 Move the globe away from an oil economy. Research and invest in green, clean, and perpetual energy. It will take power away from those who control the economy.
8422 2018-07-15 19:32:20 Stuff Elon says can be crap, but the story about him donating to Republicans is neither new nor in context. Elon has donated over $100,000 to Democratic committees and PACs. He has long said openly that he donates to both parties to defend against oil and auto industry lobbying.
8423 2018-07-15 19:32:13 I forgot that oil is needed to cook eggs and I wasn’t about to go buy oil so I used the oil from the can of tuna I had and honestly I’m impressed with myself
8424 2018-07-15 19:32:05 I assume this is taking place in Oil City, PA?!?!
8425 2018-07-15 19:31:53 Lol here in Alaska it’s different lots of lay off in the oil industry try again.
8426 2018-07-15 19:31:46 It’s hot if your coconut oil is melting
8427 2018-07-15 19:31:41 That is precisely why the oil industry is doing better than ever because employment is down 21% due to significantly improved technology.
8428 2018-07-15 19:31:36 It's useful for checking your oil in your car. You could've just asked Google though yanno 
8429 2018-07-15 19:31:31 Anti christ series: There is spoken of "12 Brides of Christ", which has symbolic meaning( aka bachelorette). Are you actions today removing you out of place, like the 6 who left to go find oil? I'm just saying theirs no time excuses when the Angel of Judgement comes knocking...
8430 2018-07-15 19:31:15 Definitely good for marinades. All good and potent for infusing oil. Not bad sauteed when you don't have fresh cloves. Ok blended in salad dressings. Not good in salsa or otherwise raw.
8431 2018-07-15 19:31:14 I should really stop cooking with oil/fat when naked
8432 2018-07-15 19:31:13 For the first 100 yrs or so America thrived on agriculture. Then came the oil, gas and coal industrial era. Now we are transitioning to the technological era. Too many people are stuck in the past and fearfully don’t want to change. Too bad, get used to it. It’s happening. #msnbc
8433 2018-07-15 19:31:10 Ok. Where is ur location? Are they oil perfumes?

8441 2018-07-15 19:30:13 I see all these gays posing naked pictures of them cooking. Apparently they have never had hot oil splatter on them.
8442 2018-07-15 19:29:59 So let’s analyze this we saved Europe WW1, WWII, then rebuilt it with the Marshall plan, protected them throughout the Cold War and continue to protect them! In return they complain about us, R.I.P. is off with trade tariffs and Germany pays Russia for oil but can’t pay 2% 4 NATO

8447 2018-07-15 19:28:57 Russia has nothing that the United States or its people needs what are you doing there they have no cars they have no oil they have nothing that we need the only thing they have is a second-rate dictator and a lot of stolen money so what is your interest
8448 2018-07-15 19:28:55 Do you know what this country spends most money importing? PETROL. So please, before you blame the average person for "liking foreign things" have you asked your govt why a crude oil producing country can refine it's on oil? Abeg

8452 2018-07-15 19:28:27 Assuming I make it to the average male life expectancy, oil will be on it's last leg when I'm about to go, so I got a decision to make. lmao

Lower property value =lower tax recipients. 
Non productive or less productive people inhabit locations where more prosperous could live generating more wealth/taxes.

2) Strategic oil production, while Obama undermined US oil production

3) Provocations abroad, while Obama retreated in defeat

4) Attacks on US servers, while Obama did nothing

Who colluded?

8572 2018-07-15 19:12:29 that’s great! But back a few years before shale, would you describe the US as under the control of OPEC when we got 60% of our oil from them? No, we went to war with them! TWICE! Just like Germany isn’t best buddies with Russia cause it’s economically beneficial to buy from them.
8573 2018-07-15 19:12:08 "Music... Gonta sorry for screaming. Music just startled Gonta."

8577 2018-07-15 19:11:37 Ask the English press that question. In my opinion, politics and football are like oil and water. Disappointed that they felt the need to shred Croatia like that before the match. Sometimes jokes aren’t funny, they’re straight up disrespectful.

8584 2018-07-15 19:10:52 Good for everyone. That’s what I use on my body with Sherry Organics body oil or just coconut oil. Very moisturizing.
8585 2018-07-15 19:10:51 Just ordered the Viking beard kit and the Aficionado beard oil from @whiskeyinklace! As pumped as I am for the shampoo bar, I'm more excited to see if the Aficionado oil smells as good as it sounds. Suddenly I'm craving a cigar...

8587 2018-07-15 19:10:44 Bloomberg believes oil is set for a second straight week of decline after Libyan ports reopened and on the view that Iran might still export some crude despite US sanctions.
8588 2018-07-15 19:10:41 It would be interesting if the minister should consider stop funding Putin by not buying his oil, else it's just hot air talk.

8593 2018-07-15 19:10:13 Feeling like a lazy Sunday on this overcast day.

8594 2018-07-15 19:10:08 I’m a part of an anti-mlm group ok FB that calls out stupid stuff like this. It happens alllll the time it’s so infuriating. People using oregano oil in their spaghetti and all 
8595 2018-07-15 19:10:06 Great business model. Create allergies then sell the treatment. Peanut oil used in vaccines and drugs.....which have created the allergy. Other food proteins used in vaccines have also created allergies. I know my stuff....

8609 2018-07-15 19:08:13 The left is literally eating themselves alive. Widespread articles from MSNBC and the like trying to take Musk down... I thought this guy was the progressive hope for competing against oil/ coal oligarchs with his cars/solar. Last I checked he was succeeding in doing this..ehh?
8610 2018-07-15 19:07:52 So how have we come to this level of poverty as an oil rich net exporter?

Where has the money gone?
8611 2018-07-15 19:07:34 Same. They have systematically eradicated hundreds of historical sites, including graves, in putting up a grotesque show of oil wealth.

8614 2018-07-15 19:07:07 There Will Be Blood but the oil is mustard.
8615 2018-07-15 19:07:05 Well tbh bleach will itch and slightly burn while you’re getting it done if it’s on your scalp but yet all depends how sensitive you are. It’s not unbearable, your scalp just feels tight afterwards, you can put some oil on it to sooth it!
8616 2018-07-15 19:06:42 I want to bathe in this Chrissy x Becca Glow Body Oil. Omgggggg. Smells so good. The glitter fades quickly but lasts a good bit I’d say, but the fragrance alone 
8617 2018-07-15 19:06:41 Imagine if you left your car parked at work. Itd have scheduled maintenance and self driving software that would take it to get washed/oil changed/tires filled/gas filled instead of just sitting there
8618 2018-07-15 19:06:36 ''Hun, i can keep a secret.''
8619 2018-07-15 19:06:35 Why don’t the administrations of Imam Hussain’s shrine and Abul-Fazl spend trillions of dollars on poor Iraqis? Why don’t the admin of Imam Ali shrine follow the same? After Iraqi oil ministry, it’s shrines that have humongous amount of funds.
8620 2018-07-15 19:06:26 WAR is their favorite and only business. 2nd place is OIL. Though both are related. Weapons and OIL and money.
8621 2018-07-15 19:06:26 Yep, I'm about to go do my morning routine of argan oil, straighteners, smoothing oil and humidity spray.    Toodles!
8622 2018-07-15 19:06:18 I’ve been burnt many times at work from the grill, the steamers and oil... but never have I ever nearly cried when I got one... this one is a killer #McDonalds
8623 2018-07-15 19:06:12 Procurement is part of supply chain management. Since I'm working at Oil and Gas, there are these weekly reports we have to submit.
8624 2018-07-15 19:06:04 I want to be an optimist and hope you're right, but a weak Canadian dollar is not good for business. Items imported cost more. Hedging strategy will be the main driver here. Unfortunately it's also likely capex went higher. Think it could be a rough ride still for heavy oil E&P.
8625 2018-07-15 19:06:03 if you throw a whale oil tank with mouse 1, it always explodes when it hits the ground. You have to put it down with F to keep that from happening, and it still can if it ends up falling down from a high distance afterwards.
8626 2018-07-15 19:05:56 Coconut oil or essential oils good for skin .... Rosken, an Australian brand, is also goooooodd
8627 2018-07-15 19:05:51 Also, if you can tell the price of oil for the next ten years can I put some money to work with you? Tesla won’t even be a main player in EV is a few years and their current market cap is way too high. There’s no other way to spin this.
8628 2018-07-15 19:05:46 Did you just get a oil change or any other work done to it as well?

8636 2018-07-15 19:04:55 Again, I know all that. As do climate scientists. Volcanic activity is minimal CO2. Remember the Iceland volcano from like 10 years ago? Carbon NEGATIVE!! (Because it shut down air travel)

8640 2018-07-15 19:04:13 I did not say there were no objectionable subsidies to oil & gas, I am pointing out that many of the things folks claim are oil and gas subsidies are not. Many of these things they claim are subsidies arising from tax code are tax rules that apply across many many industries.

8647 2018-07-15 19:03:00 They say we only have 55 years of oil. We'll see. Maybe not our lifetime. But nothing is forever.

8649 2018-07-15 19:02:39 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

8710 2018-07-15 18:54:21 Heimish walaupun dia bukan oil. Tp dia melting pas di muka. Gausah ragu kukit aku yg oily sensitif dan rewel aman pake dia
8711 2018-07-15 18:54:15 Manafort, mostly through Wilbur Ross's Bank of Cyprus. Manafort lined it up. Trump told them it was safe & they'd never get caught. Rosneft oil stock was promised too. Had Trump lifted sanctions, which he tried to do in late Jan, 2017, stock would have tripled in value.
8712 2018-07-15 18:54:08 Oil fields , Oil fields , Oil fields , Oil fields . I hate Oil fields  we didn’t have life because of Oil fields 
8713 2018-07-15 18:53:56 You're so strong with oil, please keep it up. I just don't know about the technique. Youtube? Sometimes my cheap ugly knackered brushes are so much 'better' than my posh ones, I think it's psychological! Looseing up and all that. Constant financial battle I know.
8714 2018-07-15 18:53:43 Or the other way around, just because they are good football players they are not criminals, don't go to detention camps and are treated like people. Crazy, no?
8715 2018-07-15 18:53:21 Busted my oil pan once on a broke road and the road garage had to pay for it. So yes they can .. in extreme cases lmao  roads are terrible in some spots!
8716 2018-07-15 18:53:20 4. USA nationalized industries WW1, WW2 - discussed on net.  President Truman on importance of coal while President on net.  Oil more important to Iran than coal to USA.  Eisenhower overthrew friend Iran because of oil - how would people like it if USA was overthrown because oil?
8717 2018-07-15 18:53:18 Remember when all he wanted was oil? Now he’s all like, “Cede unto me your most fertile fields and cities!”
8718 2018-07-15 18:53:15 sis u don’t even have to go to the fair for those, just make some pancake batter, dip ur oreos, fry them in some olive oil and u good
8719 2018-07-15 18:52:58 Lets face it. I love gasoline powered cars. It is what an automobile is in my book. BUT I deeply respect electric powered cars and all that's going into them. Eventually we're gonna run outta oil. I don't want auto or racing industries to die on that day.
8720 2018-07-15 18:52:54 Did a hot oil treatment before work this morning and I still have oil dripping down my neck

8725 2018-07-15 18:52:17 Not for money. Not for oil!
8726 2018-07-15 18:52:03 Hair Enhancer!  Add a few drops of rosemary essential oil to your favorite shampoo to energize and voluminize your hair!
8727 2018-07-15 18:51:58 We do not buy oil from Iran we buy from Iraq.....now you can laugh we buy oil from Russia not much around 3.8%.
8728 2018-07-15 18:51:51 I mean, seriously. Both of them have absolutely NOTHING to offer society. They aren't giving options, they are just hawking their brand. And at this point, their brand amounts roughly to snake oil. Musk is selling the same hope NASA did 50 years ago without the accountability.
8729 2018-07-15 18:51:50 All I did was go get my oil changed & what not..he only charged me $20 for just being polite & myself

8732 2018-07-15 18:51:15 I turned half thon kohlrabi into a garlicky slaw with radish, courgette, carrots and lime. Chives, coriander and mint from the back door pots; oil and a blob of crème fraîche. Would make again, it was crunchy and tasty.
8733 2018-07-15 18:51:04 Yesterday I saw a big lightning strike.
Turns out it hit the storage tanks at a oil pump and started a "tank battery fire."
You wonder why they don't use lightning rods to prevent that  stuff.
8734 2018-07-15 18:50:58 Who said move oil by rail? Those people must be stupid.
8735 2018-07-15 18:50:51 Used olive oil to open up my pores just like @jvn said to and it was a game changer! Also i have a goatee now let me know if you need an assistant coach or a golf instructor!
8736 2018-07-15 18:50:42 Cleansing oil aku cuma innisfree yang apple seed, bagus dan enak wanginya! Kulit kita juga sama tipenya

Statement.A400 has had a lot of work on it.Any new aircraft will have some issues as servicing is gotten used to but to say serious servicing issues is a bit bland, for instance does that mean the oil drain plug is hard to undo??

8757 2018-07-15 18:48:05 .@realDonaldTrump is a Russian agent since 1987. We will deal with him by 2020 and normal relations will resume. Putin is a weak man who pulled off a tremendous Op. He murders journalists, invades his neighbors and wants to restore the USSR. He’s lucky oil prices are so low.
8758 2018-07-15 18:47:56 Loveeeeee being able to use tanning oil on the beach and not burning 
8759 2018-07-15 18:47:41 Thank you for a great word this morning. Thank you Relentless leadership for having a plan to keep the oil flowing while Pastor Gray is out of town. @RealJohnGray
8760 2018-07-15 18:47:38 Frank, they are testing it...so the pump rate will vary whilst they allow the pressure to build back up again and try different choke sizes.

8766 2018-07-15 18:47:05 Already have some Arm-R-Seal oil and poly mix I’m planning to use. Mostly want durable and to bring out the color.
8767 2018-07-15 18:46:53 Excellent opportunity for Oil & Gas agency/search billing recruiters of all levels. We are working with “THE” most exciting and finacially well backed business in London who have been at the top of the O&G market before the downturn, they are rebuilding,reach out for more details
8768 2018-07-15 18:46:36 They could ban the import of plane parts to prop up airbus.
They could ban cars that are not made in France or Germany.
They could ban drilling for oil.

Many things they could do to damage our industry as they have done while we were in the EU.
8769 2018-07-15 18:46:21 learned how to check my oil/add oil to my car so i’m basically a mechanic now
8770 2018-07-15 18:46:11 BBC forgat to mention that Russia supplying  40% of the crude oil for Germany.. the gas supply will double from Russia once the pipeline is finish...
80%???.. they should  have bought  from us....
8771 2018-07-15 18:45:57 Only I could, while working in the kitchen at work, burn myself. But no the normal burn on your hands or arms, I burn myself on my face, just below my eye. Hot oil is lethal

8776 2018-07-15 18:45:37 @FoxNewsSunday - more know-nothing guests talking about how the summit is a success for Putin. Idiots! Putin is NOT isolated. The EU is buying billions of € in oil and gas from Russia. That is why they refused to stop the Crimea invasion. Russia laughing all the way to the bank.
8777 2018-07-15 18:45:35 Even if we entertain Fantasy economics, of £84m Scottish oil revenue, Scotland saw only circa £7.06m.
 In an Independent Scotland- even assuming (wrongly) that NOTHING changed- all £84m would come directly to Scotland.
8778 2018-07-15 18:45:28 I suppose since the government's good buddy, Saudi Arabia, is the main aggressor of Yemen with our weapons, we're not going to say anything. Besides Yemen doesn't have any oil, gold mines, or diamond mines we can exploit. It's just a very poor country not worth our interest
8779 2018-07-15 18:45:26 also: tocino pork, pork floss, fried potatoes (leftover), and chinese sausage are also garnishes that are sometimes overlooked but worth the try. If you fry them up save a spoonful of the oil put that in and it's unnaturally rich and blessed
8780 2018-07-15 18:45:18 I gotta Change the oil first
8781 2018-07-15 18:45:18 Olive Oil
~This is one of the best home remedies for nail growth. It helps penetrate the skin as well as the nails while it repairs damage and softens nails and cuticles  

METHOD: Soak nails in 1/2 cup of olive oil for about 15-20 minutes. Repeat 1-2 times a week.

8785 2018-07-15 18:45:00 No, but fresh produce, olive oil and lard make Italian, Spanish, and Mexican cuisine much better.
8786 2018-07-15 18:45:00 Tell her about the trillion $ Russia will make when the sanctions imposed for the -illegal attack on Crimea and strengthened for meddling in the US elections- are lifted and they can go back to drilling that oil. Or explain to her the billion dollar bailout to Trump w/Russian $.

8789 2018-07-15 18:44:35 What do you do with leftover fry oil, how do you store it.  So want to try this!
8790 2018-07-15 18:44:33 What?!?  You mean the Russians didn't just go after Dems but GOP as well?!? 

 <Clutches pearls>

Between dirty NRA money and Kompromat, I'm surprised Republicans aren't staggering around with bath oil vodka yet.
8791 2018-07-15 18:44:30 AB also got extra E.I. money when world oil pricing tanked; extra fire and flood assistance; and they even temporarily bought a pipeline to help get AB's commodity to market.

8794 2018-07-15 18:44:08 #SundayMorning My sister is visiting. We got to talking about 7th grade earth science in 1975. We both wrote reports on the coming ice age, how oil would run out by 1999, and the world food shortage killing millions. This was "scientific consensus" back then. Makes you think.
8795 2018-07-15 18:43:50 That's why I use cannabis... cbd oil is an amazing thing and it's legal in all 50 states
8796 2018-07-15 18:43:42 Norway's for instance is doing "brilliantly" as they didn't sell off all their oil & gas assets!

& contrary to people's beliefs, #UK has slightly "more'"oil and gas reserves than Norway; yet Norway has so much money... it's recently had a giveaway of funds for it's citizens?
8797 2018-07-15 18:43:34 I know people who live by oil wells that power the factories, mush
8798 2018-07-15 18:43:31 I feel like a pro wrestler covered in baby oil, but that's actually just my sweat

8801 2018-07-15 18:43:15 True—But The Worthless Bush Presidents, didn’t Allow Oil & Gas Exportation either!! Trump is the First President to do so!!
#TrumpThePatriot
8802 2018-07-15 18:43:13 What do you think of Germany doing business with Russia, giving Russia control over 70% of Germany's gas and oil, while Germany says that they need protection from Russia because Russian is an enemy of NATO and the EU?

I'll be waiting in anticipation for your answer.
8803 2018-07-15 18:43:12 So does buying a pipeline, subsidizing oil and gas co’s, providing huge pensions to MPs, etc. etc. I agree tax money is not a bottomless pit. We are in agreement.
8804 2018-07-15 18:43:12 So, any deal May does will be rejected in parliament. Which will leave us either delaying our exit or crashing out. The government dare not tell us how disastrous that would be, as it would lead to food, gas, oil and medical supplies hoarding. Civil disobedience would follow!
8805 2018-07-15 18:43:05 Strzok needs to compensate every dem in that hearing. The objections and calls for order to keep him from answering were worthy of best defense attorney fighting a losing battle. 
Shows who's side they are on. It's not the American people.
8806 2018-07-15 18:43:01 "Hello!"

Gonta just waves and smiled back at Souda.
8807 2018-07-15 18:43:00 Yes, I agree. And the economic collapse was due to falling oil prices. But if they had simply used - for example - USD in Venezuela, then would still have a functioning monetary system, and thus enjoy better economic performance than they do now.

8815 2018-07-15 18:42:01 where Scotland would still continue to see but 8% returned in the union , not all of it as it would do if independent.

Then theres blocking oil on the Clyde for berthing Trident.
8816 2018-07-15 18:41:43 Sick of people asking me why I didn't mention Jews in Q - The Plan To Save The World. Stop conflating Jews and Zionism. Jews are just people. Zionism is a scam invented to seize oil reserves in the Golan Heights and they built a fortified State to force out anyone who disagreed.
8817 2018-07-15 18:41:41 $70 for an oil change & $30 for gas.

8824 2018-07-15 18:40:41 Yea tell that to all those who lost their high paying jobs in aluminum, steel, oil, mineral. Tell that to the subs including electricians by the way. Suggest you check his voting record. The onerous regulations that thru congress & Obama's office he never spoke against once.
8825 2018-07-15 18:40:38 The same reason a permit to put in wind or solar on your property costs $10,000.
They charge too much for electric cars.
The government is funded off of oil.
Any deviation will cost you.
In order to even move the product there has to be a rebate.
I would love to have a Tesla.
8826 2018-07-15 18:40:31 Yet you quite happily oil the wheels of the Orange PR machine by chatting to a racist, sexist, homophobic father of an elephant killer. I’d call it double standards on your part, but you clearly don’t have any standards.

8846 2018-07-15 18:38:02 Selling oil, bombs, and erections seems to be the point.
8847 2018-07-15 18:37:46 For soup, cook diced shallots in oil, then simmer with lentils, rosemary, coconut milk and black beans. Top with chopped peanuts.
8848 2018-07-15 18:37:35 my fingers smell like lavender oil
8849 2018-07-15 18:37:30 Oh my God!! O__O. I thought Invasion USA was a more goofy Red Dawn starring Chuck Norris.... This is not goofy. 

After this, I swear I'll get my oil changed. — watching Invasion USA (1985 film)
8850 2018-07-15 18:37:19 Many lessons to learn from the Norwegian oil industry and management of oil proceeds.
8851 2018-07-15 18:37:18 Fred Glass is a politician. Was a big Dem up in Indy. Got Lucas Oil Built. His job at IU which he has done a great job was new facilities. I think when it comes to hiring he really has no clue. I think he thought the school got the death penalty which they didn’t. I blame him.
8852 2018-07-15 18:36:46 "I mean usually your heart beats fast when you think of them and You feel really close to them."
8853 2018-07-15 18:36:14 I agree. Elon has transitioned enough islands and little cities to 100% renewables that we can see big oil stocks drop a little.
8854 2018-07-15 18:36:12 In case you haven’t been keeping up this season on LFs, Winston and Scottie are like oil and water socially. Brett’s a casualty by association. Both are physical threats in the game #BB20

8858 2018-07-15 18:35:14 I give my dog a natural liquid relaxer when people come over but i haven’t tried it for when she goes to the vet or groomed, i know they have cannabis oil for dogs that help with anxiety and all that.. I just haven’t looked into yet.
8859 2018-07-15 18:35:10 THE U.N. LOOKS THE OTHER WAY AS THE #NICARAGUA CHILDREN ARE BEING KILLED. THEY SAY NO OIL IN THEIR COUNTRY? WHY DOES CUBA AND VENEZUELA WANT TO KILL THEM? FOR THE LAND?

Thank you for reading  Dampen your hands/face with warm water (not hot), pour the oil into your damp hands and rub it in for 5-10 seconds, then apply it on your face and go in circular motions. Wash off with warm water. Follow up with micellar water to remove oil residue.

8876 2018-07-15 18:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
8877 2018-07-15 18:32:30 Why do oil and gas workers need a cowboy hat? Shouldn’t they wear an oil and gas hat?

8885 2018-07-15 18:30:25 Recent examples: scientists, psychologists, life coaches, neurosurgeons, oil company executives, mediocre New York real estate developers, etc. etc. Expertise in a field doesn't automatically confer authority in unrelated fields, despite our universal hubris.
8886 2018-07-15 18:30:21 Sorry to hear you have epilepsy, u tried cbd oil?
8887 2018-07-15 18:30:13 ... the Ole Henriksen Truth serum, Acure rosehip oil or Mychelle's clear skin serum. For moisturizer, I really like Sukin's facial moisturizer (which you can find at Ross or TJ Maxx on sale all the time). Derma E's purifying mask or The Body Shop's tea tree mask are awesome too!

8889 2018-07-15 18:30:10 Lmao, they make pizza the traditional Italian way. The way it was first introduced to The US. You're used to the new American style, the sauce being sweetened with sugar, different quality tomatoes and olive oil. They would probably say the same about our pizza, haha
8890 2018-07-15 18:30:01 ทุกอย่างมันเบาบางไปหมด
8891 2018-07-15 18:29:59 Oil block ke.....
8892 2018-07-15 18:29:54 That's just wealth created by the nation's economy. Why difference does it make if it's specifically nationalized oil verses any other source of national wealth?
8893 2018-07-15 18:29:53 Wah this prices my friends are getting out of hand.. Hopefully now that we are producing oil we can supply ourselves before we go exporting it 
8894 2018-07-15 18:29:42 I worry that consumer protection products/services are actually just taking advantage of consumers who have awareness a risk exists but don’t understand likelihood or how their exposure to that risk changes by entrusting their data to yet another snake oil salesman.
8895 2018-07-15 18:29:35 I need to do a coconut oil treatment on my hair. It’s been way too long.
8896 2018-07-15 18:29:23 Thinking vegetable oil is safer,  people this day's use it instead of animal fat. Frequent consumption of vegetable oil have been officially extracted is bad for the body. Fried food generally will exhaust your body's enzymes.
8897 2018-07-15 18:29:18 WE DONT HERE DEMS COMPLANING ABOUT GERMANY BUYING THEIR OIL FROM RUSSIA INSTEAD OF THE U.S.- OUR PRESIDENT IS RIGHT ON ALL ISSUE'S!
8898 2018-07-15 18:29:12 You know you’re in an oil town when even the First Nations drive expensive trucks
8899 2018-07-15 18:28:42 Anyone upset that Musk called a rescuer a pedo because he said that submarine wouldn't work obviously is an oil company shill.
8900 2018-07-15 18:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
8901 2018-07-15 18:28:33 I Personally know at least 20 Iraqi's who work in oil and energy industries from brownfield to subsea. Never given the chance back home to help.

8902 2018-07-15 18:28:17 The other day @EricLabRat walked into my house to drop something off and I was letting my cat lick extra coconut oil off my fingers, totally not weird at all (HE DEMANDS IT OKAY)
8903 2018-07-15 18:28:07 It feels really good to tell the people changing my oil, "naw I don't need anything else, I'm getting a new car in a month"
8904 2018-07-15 18:28:07 Prediction: oil shortage next and we go over a $100
8905 2018-07-15 18:28:06 Airopro oil cartridges are on sale today!
8906 2018-07-15 18:28:05 2.80? It just went up to 3.15 here. We pay the highest fuel prices in the state of TX here. Of course they doing that because it's the oil patch and they are making mega bucks off the oil comps/oil service comps.
8907 2018-07-15 18:27:55 I think if you feel the need for a PI you probably should just move on anyway... a vital component seems to be missing.
8908 2018-07-15 18:27:41 @WinnDixie what type of oil do you use to fry food? I’m allergic to nuts and want to make sure it isn’t fried in peanut oil or something similar.
8909 2018-07-15 18:27:36 I ain’t drinking castor oil, I like my insides
8910 2018-07-15 18:27:33 Shaving with baby oil gel works
8911 2018-07-15 18:27:33 I expect it would have an oil pressure warning light as well (check  owner's manual) - just keep an eye on that as well, and if it stays on,  rather tow! Another issue could be a worn cam belt, which is serious -  keep the revs low & have them check it.
8912 2018-07-15 18:27:06 @weirdmedicine what are your thoughts on CBD oil? What are the pros and cons? Could it help with planter facia pain?
8913 2018-07-15 18:27:04 Olive Oil. Lol not kidding!

8916 2018-07-15 18:26:38 "Souda... You know you can tell me."
8917 2018-07-15 18:26:32 Thanks for that clarification.   

Try to find a well cost in any investor presentation on tight oil or shale gas--almost impossible. Lots of information about lateral length and absurd EURs but precious little about actual costs. Why not?
8918 2018-07-15 18:26:31 I want more saturated fat. I don’t think the evidence for its being intrinsically unhealthy is very strong. I eat lots of butter and coconut oil and beef fat. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong.
8919 2018-07-15 18:26:28 This frequent take on the show is truly instructive. We cultural effetes assume everyone knows all of the funny, obvious ironies about the world and reality.

But those who strip-mine the future for modest oil dividends have no idea, nor do they care. It’s a different planet.

8922 2018-07-15 18:25:49 Akhir-akhir ini sering cuman make micerall water sama baby oil doang kalo mau bobo. No cuci muka. Aku gatau deh bakal gimana ni muka berontak ntaran.
8923 2018-07-15 18:25:37 Put your purse down, girlfriend, and try again...
8924 2018-07-15 18:25:08 I don't see the issue as being about oil anymore. It's about the severe shortages of goods in their country, caused by shuttering businesses.
8925 2018-07-15 18:25:01 Don’t forget about all those Texas oil men -this was an oil coup remember
8926 2018-07-15 18:24:56 They only assisted us to get partial control of the oil in the Niger Delta. The same reason why the British backed Nigeria and control the oil today. Africans have no friends. They smile in our face because of natural resources.

8928 2018-07-15 18:24:43 That's what happens when you spray down the field with olive oil pre-game.

8934 2018-07-15 18:24:05 Subsidies that were created under Bush 43 when oil was $140 a barrel. Might have been a compromise with dems, but it was a pre Obama plan.

8941 2018-07-15 18:22:21 So Putin wants a strong U.S. economy and military? U.S is the leading export of oil now. That not good for Russia.
8942 2018-07-15 18:22:21 Oil and Gas Production Statistics
2016-17
Date: 13 September 2017
In 2016-17, oil and gas fields in Scotland accounted for 96 per cent of UK crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production, and 63 per cent of UK natural gas production.
Oh dear - Jim caught lying 
8943 2018-07-15 18:22:18 I have to keep oil air fresheners plugged all around my apartment I love when my place just smells so good 
8944 2018-07-15 18:22:14 Take your oil....
8945 2018-07-15 18:21:45 To the young people that’s driving, make sure you be checking your oil at least every two weeks or a month ... or ya ass gone be car less if you fuck up that motor

8950 2018-07-15 18:21:22 Have you tried googling recipes with minced garlic in olive oil?
8951 2018-07-15 18:20:59 #UK pushed for the New Age Ltd oil deal with @PR_Paul_BIYA so it's not deference to #France but self interest that's keeping the UK silent.

At this point, you should be able to see that we are so so F*CKED. What a joke of a country. Let those that want to collect the 5k collect it in peace biko.

8974 2018-07-15 18:18:04 I'm with you on this, similar clubs in many ways..we struck oil! Genuine honest fan base, ethic to play entertaining football, bar the Moyes period!
8975 2018-07-15 18:18:01 We bought an air fryer so that we can have sorta fried things without having our arteries clog. It's made me not like actual fried in oil things so much.

8977 2018-07-15 18:17:16 I'm not saying there was a direct correlation. I'm saying that accelerating inflation from the oil collapse prompted policy that decimated their economy even further, causing the hyperinflation.

8979 2018-07-15 18:16:59 Tom Watson has been keeping his powder dry for some time. The chaos over Tory mismanagement of Brexit snake oil promises and consequent Lab lead in poles is getting the 'centrists' worried. Painting Lab as supporting May is a sneaky way to confirm idea of Corbyn supporting Tories

8981 2018-07-15 18:16:32 I had to oil her joints like the tin man
8982 2018-07-15 18:16:30 The oil has 0 value when it’s sitting in the ground undiscovered.  Labor has to find it, extract it, refine it, ship it and pump it.   Labor has to keep track of the process along the way.  The ONLY reason it has value is labor. Obviously.
8983 2018-07-15 18:16:05 People back home are getting wrapped up in MLM scams for oil diffusers.
8984 2018-07-15 18:16:00 Maybe during the oil boom time.nt sure there will ever be a time like that
8985 2018-07-15 18:15:58 Love old cook books - my mother's version of Delia told you to go to the chemist's to buy olive oil...
8986 2018-07-15 18:15:24 Don’t talk about you winning the league. You can’t even win the champions league with your oil money team founded in 2008
8987 2018-07-15 18:15:17 All this caused by FIFA accepting oil money
8988 2018-07-15 18:15:06 Very few Ugandans will be celebrating this coz already govt has borrowed in excess banking on this oil.

8992 2018-07-15 18:14:53 Once the Oil dries up, the politicians will flee in droves with their families to the abroad, leaving the masses to face the looming devastation. It's just a matter of time, 9ja will soon be like Somalia/Sudan.

9005 2018-07-15 18:13:01 Maybe. It's been a while since I bought pizza from a major chain, there's a local place around the corner we order from that's really good.  All I remember of Papa John's is the garlic oil dip.

9007 2018-07-15 18:12:55 Basically - the veg + a block of halloumi and 2tbsp each of harissa and olive oil - squeeze lemon juice and season when cooked (25mins)
9008 2018-07-15 18:12:37 Home made! Salt & vinegar or spicy are best! Bagged crisps/chips are tasty yea — but tastiER when you made them! You need the right potatoes, the right oil & ingredients though but worth it in the end! (Same goes for nachos!)
9009 2018-07-15 18:12:28 Theres one looming issue that these 2 are certainly discussing, aside from legal issues. The fact that daily oil use is 100 million barrels a day & its going to lead to a huge war. Every nuclear power has high usage & therefore the impending crisis takes on an even worse aspect.
9010 2018-07-15 18:12:18 So you're saying instead of using cotton bud to clean the ear, one can safely put a little olive oil & dts it...

9015 2018-07-15 18:11:55 Fuck that!
9016 2018-07-15 18:11:47 I think it sad when the U.S. makes a massive oil and gas deal with Canada and China reaps the benefits.  I think any oil and gas deal is destructive to our planet.
9017 2018-07-15 18:11:40 He can fuck right off with this shit.
9018 2018-07-15 18:11:20 just spilled oil all on my fucking pants bruh
9019 2018-07-15 18:11:19 ...okay, you're wrong twice:
1) most companies in Venezuela remain un-nationalized
2) they were importing food before, they got a hard time paying for it now because oil prices went down.
9020 2018-07-15 18:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: chewy crust with damp motor oil and philly beef.
9021 2018-07-15 18:10:48 So @elonmusk if you actually cared about people why must I still pre-stir all-natural peanut butter? I just spent 7 minutes mixing that top oil layer back in—now there's peanut butter all over the jar, the knife, the counter, some on my hand, Elon will you commit to fixing this??
9022 2018-07-15 18:10:43 Hey adub7669, they are making deals with Russia oil.
9023 2018-07-15 18:10:36 I see. So, OPEC manipulating oil prices, which is like 75% of Venezuela's economy, actually WASN'T crippling economic warfare. Gotcha.

Brb, rethinking this whole thing.
9024 2018-07-15 18:10:34 Fammmmm i’ve been tryna take it off in shifts. I’ve tried butter, oil, soap & water  i’ve even broken part of the ring.
9025 2018-07-15 18:10:31 In that case Putin better rewire that puppet. Cause he is telling the EU they need to quit buying oil from Russia
9026 2018-07-15 18:10:13 There is a consistent belief that hedge funds; “institutional money” is coming into the market to save it. I’d like to share a brief story of before I was in crypto trading oil futures

9028 2018-07-15 18:10:07 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
9029 2018-07-15 18:10:07 They don’t need to. The ear takes care of it without any help.

Except in cases of impacted wax where you may put a little olive oil.
9030 2018-07-15 18:09:55 only when i forget not to use olive oil.
9031 2018-07-15 18:09:53 Kam said he is tryna drill those cheeks for oil ON GAWD.
9032 2018-07-15 18:09:50 You mean you haven’t bought into his snake oil routine ?
9033 2018-07-15 18:09:48 Wash your face, dry it, wipe it with alcohol, then wipe with witch hazel, then mix raw Shea butter and olive oil together in your hands then rub on your face for moisture
9034 2018-07-15 18:09:36 Gotta say, without Italy, Netherlands, and Chile in the World Cup, I was expecting this year's edition to be a bit of a mess. No question it would've been better w/ all of those sides included, it still turned out to be a heckuva tournament 
9035 2018-07-15 18:09:36 Yeah it’s gross. Syria and OPEC will be topics? My ass. + what would we negotiate? Russia backs Assad and doesn’t give us much oil. The whole thing is a farce at best, treason at worst.

9039 2018-07-15 18:08:59 ‘Rohingya’ crisis recently began with discovery of oil & gas in Rakhine State, & the Chinese are benefiting from it! Thus, a sudden interest in the region. Even the name ‘Rohingya’ was unknown in even Rakhine State amongst Muslims till then! Myanmar need s to focus on unity!
9040 2018-07-15 18:08:56 If oil is made out of dinosaur fossils and plastic is made out of oil, doesn’t that mean that plastic dinosaurs are made out of real dinosaurs?
9041 2018-07-15 18:08:56 i love the way chili oil stays on your tongue after a bowl of noodles, and i love how a swig of cold beer does not dull the sensation, v post-coital
9042 2018-07-15 18:08:44 Avon has an oil not made for bugs but they found it keeps them away! Used it years ago! Sorry can’t recall name, but Avon can tell you!!!

9045 2018-07-15 18:08:28 What needs to be known is that if not for crude oil proceeds, how ll buhari pay salaries of federal civil servants too. No single manufacturing sector in last 3yrs. It's collective failure of governance in Nigeria

9049 2018-07-15 18:07:46 Now everyone wants to come out with shimmering body oil 
9050 2018-07-15 18:07:44 Is it the oil in them that makes it easy to peel from them...?
9051 2018-07-15 18:07:42 You’re right John, the break in the system does give them purchasing power. Realizing that $30 a barrel did occur, it wasn’t sustainable. Once oil production is ramped up and sustained Iraq will have issues and have no other choice but to revalue is the point.
9052 2018-07-15 18:07:40 Probably for the best,
If the smell of burning cod liver oil is anything like opening the dishwasher the day after you’ve had fish you’d only try it once I recon 
9053 2018-07-15 18:07:23 No please. The regular Shea butter mixed with normal coconut oil.

This is not a complicated thing.
9062 2018-07-15 18:06:08 “... safflower oil, canola oil, corn oil, sesame oil, soybean oil and sunflower oil” are industrial seed oils and are not healthier than oils found in nature. 

Please follow the works of investigators who are not encumbered by COI and who do not have reputations to protect.
9063 2018-07-15 18:05:48 people (esp “health vegans”) forget how important both fat & salt are to the flavour profile of comfort foods. they do ridiculous things like sub squash for oil & under-salt the sauce (which needs to be VERY salty to stand up to cooked noodles) and then pretend like it’s delish.
9064 2018-07-15 18:05:39 Does this concern you at all @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau as you work to build more pipelines so you can up oil production?
9065 2018-07-15 18:05:38 I use a 30 cal too, fuck it every night. Which oil do you find best?
9066 2018-07-15 18:05:14 Man an 8oz-10oz bottle of pure Argon oil is like $17.99. I put that shit back so damn fast today. The small bottle of tea tree oil was already $9.99.

9092 2018-07-15 18:00:47 I'm against the Norwegian Whale hunt myself . No one knows for sure what the impact of the whale hunt may have done to  the rest of the marine life in our Oceans the last 175 Y . A paradox . USA's  oil rush in the 1840's got most nations to end their whale hunt almost over night
9093 2018-07-15 18:00:46 I fear that the only Scots heading to Qatar in 4 years are those working in the oil & gas industry! I hope I’m proved wrong. After all, if a nation with a population of 4m can have their team make the WC final ...
9094 2018-07-15 18:00:42 Maybe so, but he wasn't responsible for engineering a situation where oil companies can load tankers at the well head and avoid 100% tax on the oil.
This is the transport method of choice now - obvious innit.

9113 2018-07-15 17:58:36 We aint. Konsa oil hai? Ya any raw materials in enough quantities that we can export? Gas bhi khatam ho gai hai.

9121 2018-07-15 17:56:56 For used motor oil #rosefoundation *usedoil@iafrica.com* think all service stations are affiliated to this org
9122 2018-07-15 17:56:49 @kathy101252 @55kimmie ..... it’s supposed to say motor oil...not...mother oil.....
Mother oil makes no sense....
Motor oil motor oil motor oil....
Forget it the moments gone
9123 2018-07-15 17:56:44 Are you actually aff yet but? Who told you the oil was running oot?
Clue: it’s no running oot
9124 2018-07-15 17:56:40 use good oils like olive oil
9125 2018-07-15 17:56:25 Yes! I use it a lot & over time it’s helped my hair, sometimes I use coconut oil too
9126 2018-07-15 17:56:11 Russia gets some oil and passage rights and Ukraine gets ownership and royalties...
9127 2018-07-15 17:56:09 ไปเสิร์ชมาแล้วแพงจริงด้วย งั้นเราเที่ยวไม่ได้แล้วดิ
9128 2018-07-15 17:55:55 For my natural hair ladies if you use Argan oil shampoo & conditioner the dollar tree has them!
9129 2018-07-15 17:55:40 For curly hair, is there anything besides coconut oil to put in your hair after you get it colored?
9130 2018-07-15 17:55:31 NO YOU SAID Germany was wrong to buy natural gas from Russia cause it put them under Russia’s control. I  asking are we under the control of Iran cause we buy their oil? Should we instead pay $5 a gal at the station to avoid Iran TRYING to make demands on us?
9131 2018-07-15 17:55:31 Yè. I’m sure you’ve tried oil. If it doesn’t come off today let the swelling go down and try again tomorrow
9132 2018-07-15 17:55:19 She needs oil with THC like Alfie’s oil
9133 2018-07-15 17:55:14 Actually, your parents shouldn't put it in your lunch if youre not comfortable with it. I told my parents if they want to cook for me, not to put oil. Its better not to eat it next time, bc either way it goes to waste except if you don't eat it ur mentally + physically better
9134 2018-07-15 17:55:05 Hian. Not that serious na
9135 2018-07-15 17:54:57 Yea cause all those deaths by cannibas oil is zero, all those deaths by big pharma in the millions... You want to die by them go ahead leave the rest of us alone
9136 2018-07-15 17:54:43 Omissions from oil & gas industry manifesto. No mention of need for EU to go net zero carbon. No mention of pollution damages from their products. No mention of Russia & other unstable fossil supplier countries. No mention of economic damage from oil price spikes. I wonder why?
9137 2018-07-15 17:54:42 omg i love how the oil looks on your skin
9138 2018-07-15 17:54:31 And those who can’t afford it will just die I guess, as long as you have yours right? no problem spending money on the military, oil subsidies, and tax breaks for the super rich either right? Those things are important, not like healthcare...
9139 2018-07-15 17:54:27 Sure is. Although there is quite a lot of oil on my floor right now.
9140 2018-07-15 17:54:14 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! Zen!
9141 2018-07-15 17:54:10 The modern people in the papers say they don't want :-

1. CHRISTIAN CORONATION & 

2. They don't want Olive Oil ? - Oil to be used!

BUT THE LADY WAS ANOINTED WITH HOLY OIL ON HER HEAD, HER CHEST, HER ARMS !

これからもマイペースに！まったり頑張ります！
9143 2018-07-15 17:53:52 You can't be a @realDonaldTrump supporter AND love #America. Oil and vinegar. Doesn't mix.
9144 2018-07-15 17:52:38 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
9145 2018-07-15 17:52:20 On pollution facts, don't be fooled by rhetoric of oil and gas trade groups - Environmental Defense Fund (blog)
9146 2018-07-15 17:52:18 気が付いたら3時で大惨事って感じ
9147 2018-07-15 17:51:42 Putin knows who all the players are and what the indictment represents... Putin will see you foolish...  Were the president forced to bring it up.... Brush it off quicker than bringing it up or risk looking foolish... US wants oil on and Russia wants up...
9148 2018-07-15 17:51:42 LRT... If I say I’m here for an oil change, JUST CHANGE MY OIL. I don’t want new filters or anything else today
9149 2018-07-15 17:51:40 I'm addicted to peppermint oil
9150 2018-07-15 17:51:19 L- liquid (or leave in), O- oil, C- cream...in whichever order works best for you.
9151 2018-07-15 17:51:15 in terms of societal harm and public perception, FB is the current equivalent of oil and tobacco industries... combined
9152 2018-07-15 17:51:12  Liberals back big oil...
9153 2018-07-15 17:50:54 Oil, which is the reason for the underwear (no one wants to have to dunk their junk in paint thinner). If it was latex, this wouldn't even be a question.
9154 2018-07-15 17:50:26 Loool.. It's about who did it first. You lot have been a "unceremonious sacking" club since you became a club in 2004 with Russian Oil and Fraud money
9155 2018-07-15 17:50:24 4 years of endless wait!!!!
9156 2018-07-15 17:50:23 DON'T FORGET...THEY DO IT FOR THE MONEY. MCCONNELL CAME TO DC & MADE A GOOD SALARY BUT HE MUST BE THE WORLD'S BEST SAVER..BECAUSE HE IS NOW THE RICHEST DUDE IN KENTUCKY! PAUL RYAN & LOTS MORE.THEY TOOK MONSANTO $$ & BIG OIL $$ & MORE. RYAN'S TAX PLAN THAT GAVE OUR $$ TO THE RICH.
9157 2018-07-15 17:50:12 With due respect to ur answer,all this factors you mentioned can be managed and worked around..I do oil and gas logistics round the country...so I know those routes and conversant with the factors...
9158 2018-07-15 17:50:09 Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,
9159 2018-07-15 17:50:07 Sutherland spaceport is a half hour drive from home of UK prototype fast reactor, and navy submarine reactor test sites. An hour from worlds largest tidal stream array. Cutting edge uk battery factory. Oil and gas fabrication facilities. Not a Local Hero esque story at all.
9160 2018-07-15 17:50:05 Is the coconut oil nice then?
9161 2018-07-15 17:50:05 You can get oil out a chestnut though - easier than getting sense out a  rifhtvenough
9162 2018-07-15 17:49:58 Wow I finally found an oil that works for my natural hair
9163 2018-07-15 17:49:53 おめでとうございます！
RTAより語りが面白いので見に行ってます！
これからも頑張って下さい！
9164 2018-07-15 17:49:47 1. go back to HEB
2. buy a loaf of their French bread and a mess of olive oil
3. put the olive oil in a saucer 
4. sprinkle thyme in the oil
5. use the bread as a vehicle for this amazing delicious oil and thyme snacc
9165 2018-07-15 17:49:42 Dude, same. Plus I mix it in with coconut oil and basically smother myself in it. I feel AMAZING!
9166 2018-07-15 17:49:30 that works! so does pam or cooking oil lol and i know she knows it too! =)
9167 2018-07-15 17:49:15 見知った仲だから、セフセフ！
9168 2018-07-15 17:49:10 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
9169 2018-07-15 17:49:09 you want some of this CBD oil bro?!!
9170 2018-07-15 17:49:04 Less about product and more about process for me - detangle your hair thoroughly before washing! I use a spray bottle and oil to saturate sections of hair as I detangle with fingers/wide tooth comb. Does wonders for curl formation and for volume!!!
9171 2018-07-15 17:48:56 とうとうほとんど実践もないままに学者が70に。装備買うお金ないけれど、これで3ロールだせるー。ジョブクエは、もやもやする終わり方でちょっと残念。
9172 2018-07-15 17:48:52 Spent about 2 hours in Walton park and it looks like I’ve spent 3 weeks in Dubai lavished in cooking oil 

Need about 8 packs of Anadin extra to get through tonight
9173 2018-07-15 17:48:51 Sam used the cuticle oil to lube up the BR door so it wouldn't be squick so loud anymore #bb20
9174 2018-07-15 17:48:44 It's okay... Mormonism is a really weird religion when you start to delve into the theology. And my older brother and I were always like oil and water. He thinks girls should do girl things, boys should do boy things and my sis and I tended to vehemently disagree!
9175 2018-07-15 17:48:40 You could do us a favour, and not sell oil to the nazis before entering next time
9176 2018-07-15 17:48:37 The whole tournament was brilliant, your Grandma will be very proud of France and all the other players - good gamesmanship and let's be having some COME ON YOU BLUES later in the Summer.  In the meantime, GLA LTH 
9177 2018-07-15 17:48:30 Where this has been proposed in U.S, rabid anti GMO activists and ignorant public have aggressively opposed it.
9178 2018-07-15 17:48:30 I have to take my car to get the oil change because my mum won’t let me drive it far aldhkwdgjsd but I have been lazing around
9179 2018-07-15 17:48:29 Love the oil set 
9180 2018-07-15 17:48:13 But you’re cool with the oil subsidies, right? Whew.
9181 2018-07-15 17:48:12 Thanks - Just the Coconut oil has worked amazingly well for me so far.  I also has fungus under my nails that gradually went away using this - I give some to my cat and no fleas anymore, too.
9182 2018-07-15 17:47:56 You are the fakir.  Snake oil salesmen.   They are actively involved w nukes
9183 2018-07-15 17:47:56 The oil industry is flourishing rn
9184 2018-07-15 17:47:39 CBD Oil is the only way to go...
9185 2018-07-15 17:47:30 We need more consecrated virgins. Lol. That's where we get extra virgin olive oil from.
9186 2018-07-15 17:47:26 The "noxious fumes" in your photo seem to be mostly water droplets from cooling towers. And fracking produces natural gas which has a lot lower carbon emissions than either coal or oil. #neverletthefactsgetinthewayofagreenstory
9187 2018-07-15 17:47:17 Da! I've said all along they probably want to partner up in  Arctic oil.  Putin has military there. They're halfway there.
9188 2018-07-15 17:47:09 Oil is not a chestnut pal
9189 2018-07-15 17:47:02 Somebody oil the door @ScottishOpen #BradleyStone

Retarded roach's.
9193 2018-07-15 17:46:22 Loads of gunk on my skin left behind by a variety of plasters. Rapseed oil cleaned it away in a flash.
9194 2018-07-15 17:46:19 "No puppet!"  "You're the puppet!"

How did so many people NOT see through this snake oil salesman?

Low IQ, con man.  

And MILLIONS bought it.

Sad.
9195 2018-07-15 17:45:59 But wouldn’t lowering the minimum MPG increase our oil needs, increasing our dependence on foreign oil? Why would he do that?
9196 2018-07-15 17:45:56 For moisture, try the LCO or LOC method. Products matter but properly moisturizing/sealing matters more. And for growth, try oiling your scalp with peppermint, JBCO, or jojoba oil. And do low manipulation styles to retain length.

9199 2018-07-15 17:45:16 Miracle drops & Jamaican Black Castor Oil world just fine 
9200 2018-07-15 17:45:13 That sounds like real useful stuff there. War mongering gear and stuff owned by foreign investors. You must be so proud. In Scotland we produce oil (which is stolen from us), whiskey, fish including world famous salmon and shell fish), textiles, and ships that don’t get ordered
9201 2018-07-15 17:45:13 do u think people defended oil barons like those geeks who defend elon musk
9202 2018-07-15 17:45:06 Make a cup of coffee. Then in a blender mix the cup of coffee with 1 tblspn of coconut oil and 1 tblspn of grass fed butter.  Sounds strange, but is a staple for folks eating Keto and you will be bouncing off the walls lol
9203 2018-07-15 17:44:39 Dude oil field relationships are hard man
9204 2018-07-15 17:44:38 @jimcramer how do you feel about VNE? spin-off from Autoliv 
Also interested in frozen fries at LW?
Finally, I bought some WDFC, WD-40 out of San Diego
Would you consider this an oil play?  I have XEC and am
Looking for another oil play that isn’t SLB
Thank you

9205 2018-07-15 17:44:37 Thank you for showing what is a regular occurrence in Israel while the fake news doesn’t give a crap.  Then Israel retaliates, justly, and we hear all  the BS, and the EU is complicit because of antisemitism and OIL/$. Savages only understand force.
9206 2018-07-15 17:44:30 Do you cost the asparagus in anything?  We use olive oil.
9207 2018-07-15 17:44:28 Great, am even worried of brewing wars in #TurkanaOil, we need to have on public domain in details this agreements. For how long will Tullow Oil do the biz on behalf of Kenyans? And what is govt' plan to open refinery in Turkana? @PresidentKE
9208 2018-07-15 17:44:25 Tea tree? Hair? Noo I literally get the extra virgin olive oil from Whole Foods

9210 2018-07-15 17:44:22 Hey Kofi! Dude, you’re still alive? Wow! What’s your son up to these days? I bet he made a shit load during ‘Food for Oil’ program 
9211 2018-07-15 17:44:02 #oott rumor that trump to postpone Iranian sanction until more oil comes to market and elections are over. I think it’s more about elections
9212 2018-07-15 17:43:59 Oil (and related products) are part of it, but we still have other stuff that’s not been shut down yet. Farming, for instance.
9213 2018-07-15 17:43:56 Tha Deluded Thought Process of a Liberal
"Trump is "Weak" on Putin" yet
1)He Put Sanctions on Russia
2)Kicked Out Delegates from Russia
3)Armed Ukraine (Sumthing Obama Refused to do)
4)Hes Trying 2 Blow up tha Germany-Russia Oil Pipeline
5)Had NOTHING to do with Uranium One #HRC
9214 2018-07-15 17:43:38 Yeah it's a Walmart in Texas hurricane season.
But even so, the whole Venezuela as an example is tiresome.
Canada and Europe are doing just fine with socialism.
The US has socialist programs.

Venezuela's problem is corruption and greed and oil.

9220 2018-07-15 17:42:57 Lol! Trump is building the US military larger than ever! Bush Jnr went into a war with Iraq for no reason other than oil. Putin is trying to destabilise decades of peace.

9222 2018-07-15 17:42:47 To invest we need to make money with what we currently have and that is currently oil, our planet isn't dying, this is how it's been for billions of years.
9223 2018-07-15 17:42:36 I'll bet they can suck up.a lot of US tax dollars for that snake oil.
:-(
9224 2018-07-15 17:42:33 unless there's a solution that is also safe and viable for disabled people, who need straws more than the average person in their daily lives, then it's not a solution. find another issue to champion like idk massive oil pipelines and don't say "ew" like ableism isn't rampant
9225 2018-07-15 17:42:31 I've been looking into keto as a way to help those who suffer from those conditions. Coconut oil being key for those who want to reverse diabetes, if not eating keto or low carb, high fat for a period of time
9226 2018-07-15 17:42:22 เท่าไรคัฟ
9227 2018-07-15 17:42:09 .@elonmusk Can I beg U one innovation where cholesterol & all harmful from cooking oil is removed 100% so tht all humans dont have to worry or compromise on taste & health. U shd taste "Kanda Bhajiya" ( Onion fired in batter with indian spices) U will definitely agree.
9228 2018-07-15 17:42:08 And the Western nations have not brought them to account because they themselves are a coalitions of thieves who tell lies about weapons of mass destruction and steal people's oil, wealth, and kill innocent women/children.
9229 2018-07-15 17:42:06 Still my perceptions:
While still battling to acquire physical money, I fired my main financial manager since he convinced himself that it was all his.
I also gave him an oil tanker to resolve his dispute with the Arabs.
I got absolutely nothing in return.  SA
9230 2018-07-15 17:42:05 don't forget to mention the oil deal

9234 2018-07-15 17:41:51 Okay I need to poo and then I can workout and then I can put in a oil hair mask and then unpack and then edit my photos and that’s my plan for the day
9235 2018-07-15 17:41:49 Sir, but DAIICT is not a full-fledged university. Even IITs did not climb up the rankings. Just like how the oil and gas sector went from ONGC and IOCL to efficient Reliance Industries Limited, there is a possibility for higher education to go from IIT & IISc to Jio University.
9236 2018-07-15 17:41:42 get   oil   prices  down      America  hurts  wien   hi   gas

9238 2018-07-15 17:41:36 That Dr.Teals coconut oil lotion be having my skin sooooo soft >>> I love it 
9239 2018-07-15 17:41:36 The more I've read about him over the last year or so the more I've come to the conclusion he's a total snake oil merchant. Its all about PR, hype and getting attention. He has no integrity at all.
9240 2018-07-15 17:41:16 idk y tipping is such a difficult concept. tip your fucking servers, bartenders, tattoo artist, uber drivers. tip your nail & eyelash tech. tip the lady that does your hair or the man who changes your fucking oil. you expect great customer service, but are shit customers.

9242 2018-07-15 17:41:02 Too much reading for me right nos, does it say anything about fish oil?
9243 2018-07-15 17:40:27 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.

9250 2018-07-15 17:39:39 There won't be any alternative energy in my lifetime, my kids lifetime, my grandkids and their kids lifetime, until humans have sucked every drop of oil and every chunk of coal out of the ground.

Then they'll have to implement new clean energy. Will it be too late?
9251 2018-07-15 17:39:34 Congratulations baby and use bio oil and vitamin e oil!!

9254 2018-07-15 17:39:25 We were all worried about a World Cup in Russia, it ended up being the best in living memory
But the one in Qatar will be a travesty. No history, no team, no thought for the players or fans, just an oil tanker of cash

9256 2018-07-15 17:39:05 BREAKING.  US to buy oil from Russia.

9261 2018-07-15 17:38:39 According to the Irish Independent: "Around 1m tonnes of Ireland's oil reserves are held in ports around the country while the remaining 500,000 tonnes are kept in Britain, Holland, Denmark and Spain." They pay the other places for it, so makes sense to be in the single market.
9262 2018-07-15 17:38:35 We won't have a future if we keep going, plain and simply. And people know this, which is why it is dying. Public perception of oil is falling, especially among millenials. We will end fossil fuels. Period.

9265 2018-07-15 17:38:14 The first trillion dollar “company” won’t be Apple or Google, instead it’s Norway’s Oil Fund which just passed $1 trillion USD!

It’s fully owned by Norway’s citizens, of which each owns $192,000. Every year Norway can withdraw 3% which is $30 billion.

What went wrong with Nig?

9272 2018-07-15 17:37:17 When Brian Larkin said that bringing Graham Martin onboard who helped build Tullow Oil from a £3million company into a £multi-billion Company was like bringing Christiano #Ronaldo to Shamrock Rovers, he must have meant #Mbappe. #UOG

9276 2018-07-15 17:36:53 Oil and gas provides less jobs than renewable energy theses days my friend. There's a good reason Alberta is slowing.
9277 2018-07-15 17:36:45 The same UN that prostitutes itself for Arab oil dollars.

And of course you know all the resolutions are non-binding don't you?
9278 2018-07-15 17:36:42 @calpizzakitchen ...went there for dinner last night, worst meal we ever had there.  The garlic chicken pizza was bland. No garlic.  When asked it, the manager said they use garlic oil?  Go back to original garlic.  Also, where is the $7.29 side salad on your menu for price?
9279 2018-07-15 17:36:38 Hope you dodged the oil slick ok 
9280 2018-07-15 17:36:38 I never knew Ohio had oil.
9281 2018-07-15 17:36:34 Hard as it is to say this, he's not wrong. When you look at the history of, let's say Iran, the US was responsible for installing the Shah (remember him?) and making a mess of that country for decades. All for oil. Probably couldn't happen again...
9282 2018-07-15 17:36:31 It’s so humid out that I can’t tell if I’m wet because of the humidity, sweat, tears from crying from laughing, my face oil, or this wet dog that just jumped on me

9289 2018-07-15 17:35:28 It's not even real olive oil though. It's all hydrogenated oil with artificial olive and garlic flavors.

9297 2018-07-15 17:34:50 This is all crazy. Trump is under investigation, as Bloomberg said - "he's a con," & looking to build personal wealth, hotels, condos & an oil deal. Putin is Russia's ex-intel chief & he will run circles around Trump. #dangerous mtg. I'm in tears.

9300 2018-07-15 17:34:28 Iran is not the only country we by oil from if we do at all.
Germany will get 70% of it's energy supply from Russia...that is a very dangerous situation to be in especially during winter time.
9301 2018-07-15 17:34:26 Thank you. I thought you were gonna say tea tree oil or something lol any specific brand?
9302 2018-07-15 17:34:01 I see you baby....well I'd like to see you baby....shaking that ass.....dodging the oil...
9303 2018-07-15 17:33:59 No kidding. And America literally only helped out because Japan nuked them, and that was only because they decided to stop selling Japan oil--and until that point, had been selling stuff to both the Allies and the Axis..as well as sending Jews back to Germany. Cunts.

9312 2018-07-15 17:33:15 Oil paint or latex?
9313 2018-07-15 17:33:10 Mainly due to the crash in oil revenues. Scotland has ran up onshore (no oil revenues) debts of £235bn in the last 19 years alone.
9314 2018-07-15 17:33:07 Dopey bot forgot to oil.

9327 2018-07-15 17:31:29 I want oil companies to pay to develop all the alternatives they have quashed & to admit that our world oil supply is close to being gone, so that We can move on ASAP. They've been selfish & exploitive & it is going to lead to catastrophe.
9328 2018-07-15 17:31:28 Oil is dying? There are so many reserves that haven’t even been tapped yet!
9329 2018-07-15 17:31:27 Alaskans own 71,999 shares of NEW ZEALAND REFINING CO LTD/TH, worth $119,788. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in NEW ZEALAND.

9351 2018-07-15 17:29:30 9/11 & the Iraq War I posit was the highpoint of the "secret history" movements rekection of the official narrative. You'll recall the claims that America invaded Iraq "for oil" & of course the lack of post-invasion justification in terms of WMDs. Official history discredited...
9352 2018-07-15 17:29:09 Right, I drank the snake oil with OBama as well, during his administration I couldn’t stand even living in the US I felt so poorly represented, he policies were anti-American, and he supported the big bankers,the 2008 crash was a money give away to the ruling elite.  Dark times!

9360 2018-07-15 17:28:09 Then explain why they are pumping billions of dollars into Russian oil instead of buying from their "ally" the United States or Saudi Arabia?
9361 2018-07-15 17:28:02 Their president is  thick skull won't sell him or neymar no matter the money as oil money rocks
9362 2018-07-15 17:27:49 Utter nonsense.
The EU aren't daft.
A wealthy country that holds so much of the untapped EU oil reserves would be welcomed with open arms for that reason alone.
We would probably negotiate a Norway style entry to preserve our fishing rights & they would still be falling over us.
9363 2018-07-15 17:27:36 Rabatte für Standard Oil, HÖHERER PREISE FÜR ALLE ANDEREN. Du kannst doch nicht nur die halbe Geschichte nehmen um daraus ein Argument zu machen. Also hör mal! Das geht jetzt echt nicht.

9370 2018-07-15 17:26:09 I'm sure it makes sense to you, but in the real world, having the EU invest in its own capabilities only strengthens the NATO alliance while, simultaneously, balancing the trade deficit & encouraging EU to purchase Oil & Gas f/ the US helps the US, & hurts Russia...sound policy
9371 2018-07-15 17:25:53 This Croatian president hugs are too much abeg  she takes so long
9372 2018-07-15 17:25:40 no makeup. coconut oil everywhere. sun on skin. salt water to float in.
9373 2018-07-15 17:25:36 Oh, right! I should explain that. It's an "inside joke" for Chinese people. If you translate the characters for "good luck" in Chinese separately, they literally mean "add oil".
9374 2018-07-15 17:25:23 wish I had someone to oil my scalp and play in my hair.

Russia is a small economy, less than Italy, that mainly relies on oil to keep the place afloat, or Putin afloat that is. We don't need anything they produce, why the humility?

Mustard oil... unclear - not sure enough research. My gut says avoid it.
9382 2018-07-15 17:23:32 Not till all the oil is used up will the CO2 emissions start to reduce.

9394 2018-07-15 17:21:52 You believe that the EU, w/ 85% GDP of the US, & $151B trade surplus, is not an economic competitor? EU has refused to invest in its own military for NATO, using the US for its protection. Yet, EU gains most of its Oil & Gas f/ Russia, the same Russia the US protects the EU from.

9398 2018-07-15 17:21:10 Credit for sure  Cheap oil enabled growth and credit bubbles were inflated on the promise of future growth which in turns rests on the implicit assumption of huge amounts of net energy being available in the future. That's the 'peak' predicament.

9404 2018-07-15 17:20:22 Anytime a country puts all its eggs in 1 industry’s “BIG oil”basket, it’s asking for economic trouble. Didn’t we learn that from our previous PM #closetcommander? #RenewableEnergy #BIGoilcompanies #HarpertheEconomist #TarsSands
9405 2018-07-15 17:20:06 100's of British loves lost, billions of £'s spent for friendly fire and keeping America in control of global oil. For fuck sake. America benefit absolutely nobody on The global stage but themselves.

9412 2018-07-15 17:19:28 Banning palm oil would also destroy the market for "green" palm oil production, e.g. on Saõ Tomé.
9413 2018-07-15 17:19:25 I minced cauliflower in a vitamix, then cooked it in a pan (I think I used avocado oil, but it may have been coconut) I added seasoning to cover the flavor of cauliflower because I don’t like that flavor where it doesn’t belong. Ha. Garlic, ginger, salt, onion. Sm pinch turmeric
9414 2018-07-15 17:19:16 Neutrogenas ultra gentle cleanser! Using a toner after is good to balance your skins pH & doing a clay mask/exfoliating once a week can help. Coconut oil is one of the heavier oils & has the tendency to clog pores so it might not work for everyone. Try a water based moisturizer!

9417 2018-07-15 17:18:34 Finally tracked down my oil leak, it seems that 2 bolts holding the sumpon are loose. A quick cjeck with the torque wrench revealed an additional problem. When sump was replaced garage may have stripped the thread.

9419 2018-07-15 17:18:00 Small farmers are counting on @FRinMalaysia to keep its word on fair treatment of Palm Oil. As France prepares its final SNDI report on deforestation, it must keep its commitment to Malaysia and fair markets and oppose any Palm Oil discrimination.

9429 2018-07-15 17:16:04 Thank you for your prompt response. The info you provide acknowledges that you cannot 100% guarantee that all of the palm oil you use is produced sustainably, so I will be boycotting products with it in until I feel assured.

9439 2018-07-15 17:14:00 I agree. And I do believe it's been imperically proven that our healthcare system works better than the alternative. But I don't believe these incentives were handouts. They seemed to me like positive moves away from oil and gas, which we need to do regardless.
9440 2018-07-15 17:13:43 coconut oil is great for lube
9441 2018-07-15 17:13:41 I sent in an advertising standards complaint about that.  If the pipeline really won't lead to an increase in oil production, why not put a cap on oil production and see if there is still a business case for the pipeline?

9450 2018-07-15 17:12:22 I’ll try & find later truly amazing!! Met some guys from Dubai @WynnLasVegas kind thought oil insight ! We seem to study more than they do! Lol!
9451 2018-07-15 17:12:18 You forget the US has fucked Iranian democracy, installed a puppet dictator in that country and constantly threatens it with war. 

The US wants to control Iran's oil just like it invaded Iraq to control the oil in that country. The US is an empire.
9452 2018-07-15 17:12:06 20 fucking years. This is amazing!
9453 2018-07-15 17:12:04 I wondered the same. Did a Google and looks like price is about 25% higher, but would prob depend on petroleum resin prices, which are tied to oil, and corn resin prices, which are tied to corn.
9454 2018-07-15 17:12:01 I wish I could send scents through the internet because this new beard oil I have smells amazing.
9455 2018-07-15 17:11:47 The most impressive thing about that last #CriticalRole ep is how everyone tap danced for 5 hours around a Lorenzo’s Oil joke without ever outright saying it
9456 2018-07-15 17:11:42 Started today with 15 minutes on my foam roller while oil pulling. My new favorite morning ritual
9457 2018-07-15 17:11:38 Das Monopol von Standard Oil beruhte auf der Kontrolle des Verteilernetzes, des Schienenverkehrs. Ich vermische da gar nichts.
9458 2018-07-15 17:11:21 Don't be daft.
You are seriously suggesting an MSP can influence the thinking of a Tory UK gov?
Then give away all the majority of the oil revenue as a tax break?
Yeah, John Swinney has that sort of clout, lol.

9462 2018-07-15 17:11:09 I need food! And to go get an oil change. Lemme get up. 
9463 2018-07-15 17:11:08 i remember arguing w/ an OB a decade ago on the importance of supplementing fish oil in first trimester to assist brain development; hopefully there's less friction on the concept now.
9464 2018-07-15 17:10:59 I’m literally a piece of shit for purging that oil. wow.

9466 2018-07-15 17:10:53 I can’t believe our Enemy, France, which has its hands in our pockets due to Obama, has won the World Cup. Still, France was able to win in Russia - a reason we don’t need NATO. ENGLAND. Great Britain - fake news. Puerto Rico is next if we don’t knock out ISIS and Take the Oil.
9467 2018-07-15 17:10:40 It’s pizza night again, and I just made the doughs, each with varying amounts of ap/bread flours. I have one that has extra oil, and that will probably end up being a pan pizza!
9468 2018-07-15 17:10:29 it is and always was about a Russian Oil Deal
9469 2018-07-15 17:10:16 To confirm how poor is your knowledge, you just use gulf instead of Persian gulf. Iran supporting terrorists or not, has the ability to interrupt oil production. All to come to oil pipeline already will have destroyed the price on panic buy on the first Irani missile

9474 2018-07-15 17:09:46 The headline truly mis represents the context of the President's statement.  He was discussing trade agreements and that they are foes, competitors.  In particular, when the allies give plum deals to Russia for oil, when they could be buying from the US.  Context matters.

9477 2018-07-15 17:09:30 BTW that was the sign old school lefties put out in their yards in the midwest in 2003 back when starting wars for oil and under the REAL fake news pressure of east coast newspapers was not cool.
Lots of us never forgot HRC's cheerleading on that one.

9483 2018-07-15 17:08:59 That's what ther are doing prior to calling in American debt. Just insuring oil after they bring the West to it's knees. The only good news here is that Asia has some beautiful women.

9487 2018-07-15 17:08:44 No,use your luxe pure oil as a daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF,at all times and use your "Overnight"Serum daily at night after cleansing. Don't mix them together.

9490 2018-07-15 17:08:31 An odd World Cup Final to be sure. France showed off their brilliance during stretches of the match, both goalkeepers were poor, an iffy penalty was given to the French and Croatia was unquestionably the better of the two sides today...and yet we got the result we did.
9491 2018-07-15 17:08:21 Most voters have no interest in politics; they understand it makes no diff who is in power; we're screwed by them all. @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer Maybe folks vote for ideological based screwing?

9499 2018-07-15 17:07:23 Actually all my posts made sense and were relevant to the topic. Civil-rights movement happened during Vietnam and the recent wars are clearly about oil, not helping 'good' western puppet muslims

9501 2018-07-15 17:06:54 Ah. Now I understand how my “whale oil” tweet was ambiguous.
9502 2018-07-15 17:06:48 The one that worked well for me is the ion brand I found it at Sally’s. I colored my hair a year ago and I still see some color on the tips of my hair. Wash your hair less often. The oil in your hair maintains the color
9503 2018-07-15 17:06:46 Lol now we have next weeks CNN headlines before they do.  “Trump congratulates Putin!”   How dare he.  Rather he condemn him than turn around and buy oil from Russia.

9530 2018-07-15 17:03:46 This is the EU perspective as long as they continue to take advantage of USA on trade and NATO, while cozying up to our enemies with deals. What would EU say if USA did a multi-billion dollar deal with Russia for oil? They’re hypocrites!

9545 2018-07-15 17:02:10 - Sleeping with no electronics around you proves that you can sleep better. (If you are not comfortable doing that, just keep your phone or laptop away from you)

- If you have a defuser I recommend puttting lavender essential oil in there. Lavender scent helps you sleep.

9548 2018-07-15 17:01:52 Lol now imagine this was crude oil or diluted bitumen. I'm not a pro pipeline person but it's a safer way of shipping it to the coast
9549 2018-07-15 17:01:52 the 9/11 planes were holograms!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Faires used to be real, UNTIL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MURDERED THEM ALL!
9550 2018-07-15 17:01:47 are we making Iran great again by buying their oil?
9551 2018-07-15 17:01:30 I don't think I've ever made white sauce with cow's milk, so no idea if the quantities are similar. But it's a couple tablespoons each of oil and flour, and a couple of cups of whatever milk.

Also, I'm infamous for wildly unfussy measuring while cooking.

9553 2018-07-15 17:01:13 So We have any other foreign policy strategy other than countering terror? Oh yeah the US sets it for us. No more oil from Iran.
9554 2018-07-15 17:01:13 Okay, sooooo? OPEC/Iran ARE raising oil prices on us right now cause we pulled out of the Iran agreement. So you think we r under the control of OPEC/IRAN? That must mean Trump is acting this way because it’s what the Iranians r telling him to do?
9555 2018-07-15 17:00:52 Hair can be useful in interesting ways. It can be used as a natural sponge, and it was used during the 2007 Cusco Busan oil spill in the San Francisco Bay to absorb oil from the water.

9559 2018-07-15 17:00:29 He's still earning from the job though.
The deal with sky that he signed this year was £2 million if I remember correctly,
And the other earnings are separate I believe.

9566 2018-07-15 16:59:32 I had a weird dream about a TV show set in the world of TX oil drilling starring Taylor Kitsch, Aimee Teagarden, Zach Gilford, Cameron Monaghan (I think he was playing Ian Gallagher), & my mom of all people.
9567 2018-07-15 16:59:19 God has surrounded me with some gifted individuals. Glad to know that there is oil on my circle. 
9568 2018-07-15 16:59:18 My parents put VERY expensive olive oil on my lunch and I feel super guilty for purging it.

9572 2018-07-15 16:58:52 Oil change appointment and I gotta get my shit inspected by the end of this month 
9573 2018-07-15 16:58:43 I understand subsidies for oil and gas just fine. It doesn't change the fact that they're product has adverse side effects, ie, co2 emissions. Are they paying to clean up the air they're polluting? Clearly not. We are, tax payers are.
9574 2018-07-15 16:58:36 Lunch from a very fine tomato from @ArgusFarmStop (a second, good for cooking); some nice curry from Kasoa Market; and two eggs of indeterminate origin. Saute the curry powder in some coconut oil, add chopped tomato, cook down a bit, add eggs. Omelet or scramble to your taste.
9575 2018-07-15 16:58:27 We are loosing our culture in "Nigeria",,,, as Africans.. i just saw 2 guys washing their hands after eating bons and akara 
 instead of rubbing the oil on their heads or at the back of their foots as culture permitted.

9578 2018-07-15 16:58:12 Matt, it's simple. If this were an oil leak in the lake covering 90%, being released upon communities, would you be in favor of building another reservoir instead of stopping the contamination & cleaning up the lake? If this water wasnt so toxic, more could actually be sent south

9581 2018-07-15 16:57:50 I heard recently 2 other prophecies about the US going energy independent as well as US and Israel became the world's leading oil producers. I know Alaska was just opened up and has more oil than Saudi and it's coming soon:)
9582 2018-07-15 16:57:45 Here’s another winning idea: can you paint? Like, Bob Ross paint. Then offer an on-demand service where people describe you their dream home and make them an oil painting. It captures their goals, ambitions, and in many cases, nostalgia.
9583 2018-07-15 16:57:42 Oh I eat lots of wholewheat pasta, it makes me feel less guilty :) Tbh it's a lot better than shop-bought pesto, which has less greenery and more (cheap) oil.
9584 2018-07-15 16:57:39 You must have very early-onset stupidity. Get your oil, steel and lumber from NK from now on. Canada will do just fine without y'all...and please do not come visit.
9585 2018-07-15 16:57:22 This country has a history of propping up failing businesses, oil,coal,sugar and any Trump business. More women are nursing because it is better for their baby for health and immunity. The fact that Trump thinks it is a good idea to prohibit discussing nursing is disgusting.
9586 2018-07-15 16:57:06 It’s my first time trying it. I used it in my bare face and it feels like there’s oil in it. Do you feel it leaves your skin oily?

9589 2018-07-15 16:56:45 I drove my Subaru Outback 300km’s with my petroleum based kayak strapped to the roof to an oil tanker protest. While my gender fluid lover free bled all over the “resist” seat covers.

9598 2018-07-15 16:55:31 Lmao " God reduce the pepper " oh no not too much salt". Work your miracle on this too much oil.
9599 2018-07-15 16:55:27 I'm sure your oil will go to good use paying debt, were you born last time the tartan army even qualified for anything? Piss poor football in a piss poor league lol lol lol

9605 2018-07-15 16:55:13 He has a point. Russia has a small military for its size and does not invade and interfere all around the world. It is not going to attack any European country since they are its primary customers for oil and gas. For the Baltic states and Ukraine to be part of nato is a threat.

9607 2018-07-15 16:54:53 I happen to believe that we have a climate change crisis and that Tesla has made more progress than most at solving it. Attempts to destroy that (by oil industry, auto industry, short sellers) don’t sit well with me.

9613 2018-07-15 16:54:02 I have some vitamin E oil, I’ll try that too! Thanks
9614 2018-07-15 16:53:59 Norway? That's a good idea. Doesn't change the fact that it's all created by selling oil, a resource that they lucked into and which they chose to sell to the world market and which has been very bad for the planet.
9615 2018-07-15 16:53:59 I sure wish I would have found CBD Oil much sooner than I did! Works miracles on my rheumatoid arthritis! 
9616 2018-07-15 16:53:56 In the oil field it happens at the laundromat because someone washes oily clothes before you and leaves a ring
9617 2018-07-15 16:53:35 Merkel figured out how to make Russia great again...buy their gas and pay for the pipeline. I as a Hungarian born I worry about  Hungary... they do not have natural resources like oil and gas they have to buy everything....
9618 2018-07-15 16:53:31 At least Giroud came to world cup and won gold......morata is there buying more oil for his hair!!

9622 2018-07-15 16:52:36 You’re losing oil.
9623 2018-07-15 16:52:36 How is it removed they're still supporting the authoritarian dictator asaad who buys billions of dollars of oil and weapons from Russia
9624 2018-07-15 16:52:35 Hear me out: a 3d JRPG where the models are 2d sprites are pasted onto polygons, and the whole thing is cel shaded. Then an oil paint filter is applied on top of it all
9625 2018-07-15 16:52:19 Well, sadly for Scotland we have gas, oil, large quantity of driking water, the best Wisky and Gin and lots more.  If Scotland had none of those things WV would have be rid of us a long time ago.  Is not love, but greed that keeps them attached.
9626 2018-07-15 16:52:17 A quick-fix snake oil merchant who’s successfully selling the idea to awkward insecure losers that the game is somehow rigged against them, and it isn’t their fault.
9627 2018-07-15 16:52:08 Like u said English was hard to conceive,but at the same time ur intolerance made unable to perceive that I was just saying the effort of Pogba can not be belittled.

9630 2018-07-15 16:51:22 Wow i look in my purse and my water bottle is full of oil. 
9631 2018-07-15 16:51:04 Anyway I’m glad I finally have my license bc I’ve hated myself over it and felt very stunted for 9 years however I think the connotation of cars and driving with freedom has a lot to do with car and oil companies and it sucks that many lf our cities revolve around driving
9632 2018-07-15 16:50:59 I really need to get my oil changed today but I don't want to go to Jiffy Lube and my normal mechanic is an intellectual who doesn't work on Sundays. Any other options?
9633 2018-07-15 16:50:48 And that's a good reason to keep it?  Like it or not oil is dying. Keeping the corporate welfare alive only enriches oil execs and drains money that could be going to public services and incentives.
9634 2018-07-15 16:50:42 Bought the yummiest coconut body oil and the yummiest coconut candle 
9635 2018-07-15 16:50:38 Not a summet. 45 has no goal beyond insuring his 19% cut of Rodney oil in exchange for lifting Russian sanctions.
9636 2018-07-15 16:50:36 TRUMP WANTS GASOLINE PRICES DOWN.  RUSSIA $15/BARREL OIL.  GIVE PEACE A CHANCE.
9637 2018-07-15 16:50:28 Some even made money to force a recount, and basically bilked people out of a million $.. that doesn't mean it didn't happen though...just like wars for oil...you'd have a hard time proving it but people still know atrocities have been done in our name.. but they wouldn't cheat!
9638 2018-07-15 16:50:19 Well, that's how Spinach gets its strength, and you know, Popeye...
also....
Someone here said it's "Ironical" that Popeye's chicken is fried in Olive Oil
9639 2018-07-15 16:50:11 Give him some extra oil maybe he will come around :)
9640 2018-07-15 16:50:10 Controls his sovereign oil and doesn’t play the puppet state to USA and its allies just like funnily enough Venezuela! Strange coincidence? Much!
9641 2018-07-15 16:50:08 Let’s try some intellectual honesty and admit that a big chunk of what are termed “subsidies for oil and gas” are bullshit. Things in the tax code that apply to ALL domestic mfg or ALL U.S. companies operating internationally are not oil and gas subsidies.
9642 2018-07-15 16:50:07 Poor lad
I suppose it could be worse......he could be Southend Utd!
9643 2018-07-15 16:49:47 Oil filter
9644 2018-07-15 16:49:35 Global banks need to get into a broad agreement to absolutely stop Russian money laundering. It is their limitless oil & other dirty money that allows them to buy the corrupting influence.
9645 2018-07-15 16:49:31 Just read somewhere “If oil is made from dinosaur bones, and plastic is made from oil.. does that mean plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs?”
9646 2018-07-15 16:49:30 There's a hint of bergamot oil. Which is also in no way spicy.
9647 2018-07-15 16:49:30 Lemon oil to soften, then a scrape with a cut throat
9648 2018-07-15 16:49:19 They do buy oil products from us. You realize one of the reasons we don't sell them much oil is that we weren't exporting crude for 30 years until 2015?

9652 2018-07-15 16:49:01 I can't find the reference now, but I've read that Norway keeps an extremely high % portion of ALL oil profits in-country via regulation & taxation. Statoil + a 78% tax on other oil profits = >78% portion.
9653 2018-07-15 16:48:59 What a man. Did she have a bazooka pointed at him? A loaded RPG tube? was she in a Sherman tank? Oh I know she was about to call in a danger close airstrike on his position unless he honored the coupon. Gotta be. That or she had just doused him with lamp oil and had a lit match.
9654 2018-07-15 16:48:54 Just big oil fighting back and #fakenews doing the same
9655 2018-07-15 16:48:45 There are literally no spices in earl grey tea. It’s tea leaves and orange oil. This person probably thinks mayo is zesty.

9668 2018-07-15 16:46:38 Could it be ideological? One communist regime helping out another? Not to mention the strategic considerations in having a large stake in a country with huge oil reserves.
9669 2018-07-15 16:46:37 Stewing chicken on this lovely Sunday and hot oil popped up on my chest.
9670 2018-07-15 16:46:32 I'm not a fan of integrating my happiness with someone else's unhappiness. It's like mixing water & oil. They don't mix at all; therefore, it'll never work. #BeHappy #StayHappy #Happiness
9671 2018-07-15 16:46:09 So 99% of people wearing hats at the stampede and during stampede week are frauds? That's what you're saying. Oil and gas has nothing to do with cowboy hats whatsoever but nice manoeuvre trying to claim the cowboy hat for unrelated corp interests.
9672 2018-07-15 16:46:05 Isn't it funny how many people are against incentives that help the environment and regular folks, but never say a word about the subsidies we pay to oil and gas.

9676 2018-07-15 16:44:56 I used to be a favorite of the mosquitoes, but I started using coconut oil (from Trader Joe’s) on my skin, and I do not have such a problem now.
9677 2018-07-15 16:44:40 The European Union is the biggest gangsters. The other countries cannot do trade without their permission, while they depend on the American military to protect them.
Germany is buying oil from Russia. Is Russia our foe, or the European Union?
9678 2018-07-15 16:44:34 Coconut oil, sweet almond oil, grape seed oil..so many good oils, shea butter is so nice too, and Oyin Handmade products are my personal fave, especially their brown sugar pomade

9680 2018-07-15 16:44:12 Same could be said about oil companies, but we've had no problem subsidizing them for the last 30 years.

9688 2018-07-15 16:42:29 The US has more oil reserves than all of the ME combined.. we don't need your oil.
9689 2018-07-15 16:42:26 And,
NAFTA, and the border, and the failed carbon tax scam, and no money for vets billions to the UN, and killing our energy sector while the tankers full of sharia oil keep arriving, and pipeline disasters, and parody accounts, and investment leaving, and interest rates going up
9690 2018-07-15 16:42:21 I have 3 and only one has actual physical exfoliants (I used that one the least). I also do use a scalp oil (from a black owned brand that focuses on scalp care) but only in conjunction with scalp  massage and not dailh because that doesn’t work for my scalp
9691 2018-07-15 16:42:18 You know what will help the economy. Extremely cheap energy. Cheap oil has been one of the driving forces behind the economic explosion.

If we as a society have cheap energy, the cost of doing business SHOULD go down.

9699 2018-07-15 16:41:17 it's common sense. If @realDonaldTrump  said , let's vet us some hard working Canadians, made it easier for us to work there and be hired, start a business - your economy would boom even more. Manufacturing is up, mining, oil and gas- this is what we do.
9700 2018-07-15 16:41:11 Model 3 starts under 50k, you ignorant fool. And I hope you're just as angry about the billions in subsidies we give to oil and gas every year. Cause that's called corporate welfare.

9719 2018-07-15 16:37:55 I assume you're equally angry about the billions in corporate welfare we give to oil and gas companies then right? Or are you just against programs that help regular folk?

9726 2018-07-15 16:37:11 Oil and water separating?
9727 2018-07-15 16:37:09 If it is a sink hole than that sink hole was because countries like the UK and The Netherlands (a certain oil company) have turned it into a sink hole.

9734 2018-07-15 16:35:42 Has been the case until now because of cheap oil but things are changing fast. When the shale bubble/scam pops, the energy landscape will change dramatically. Without cheap energy, prices of all assets will collapse. Sure, let's hope technology comes to the rescue...

9739 2018-07-15 16:35:10 man i been at this place for over an hour just for a damn oil change
9740 2018-07-15 16:35:09 What a waste of money. No OE refines their own oil. It is all another refiner's product branded. The OE and dealer just mark it up more.
9741 2018-07-15 16:35:08 We didn't but to be fair we did not deserve it hopefully USA will qualify next time too for an Anglo - USA dogfight. If Trump is still sadly in power he will be licking his lips at the corrupt oil deals he could get from Qatar.

9753 2018-07-15 16:33:31 What they wanted was the oil and gas deposits in the Black Sea (another main reason why Putin preemptively annexed Crimea). Hunter Biden, Joe's son, sits on an energy board based in Kiev. That tells you everything you need to know.
9754 2018-07-15 16:33:21 You logic is failed.

9766 2018-07-15 16:31:05 The only thing improving is the govs bottom line bcz of higher oil prices. Everything else, including jobs, is in the boghouse. It's a disaster out there and putting a BS dressing on a word salad just makes you look detached from reality.

9781 2018-07-15 16:29:56 So technically weed still isn’t legal in Oklahoma as it can only be perscribed by a doctor, and it can only be ingested in pill, or oil form. I say keep weed illegal. It’s more fun that way anyway.

9798 2018-07-15 16:28:06 I poured pure coconut oil in her food for the first week or so to try to encourage fur growth. I was BEAMING with pride when we went to the vet and one of the techs gasped when they touched her. “She’s SOOOO soft!!”

And the last thing it represents is "oil and gas", jackass.

9819 2018-07-15 16:26:50 Not to mention the subsidies we already pay to oil and gas every year.
9820 2018-07-15 16:26:48 A tiny linguistic note: American announcers have adopted the British “France are,” “Croatia are,” style. What gives? Will they next check the oil under the bonnet of their car?
9821 2018-07-15 16:26:27 p.s Graph is from the article.  It is good to see some companies are already planning for reality of decreased oil consumption w the shift happening toward EV’s.
Obviously still a huge challenge: large portion of electricity via natural gas, coal; methane emissions/leaks.

9837 2018-07-15 16:23:57 Idiotic but TRUE, did you not cheer when Trump said military will execute entire families, our soldiers would bring back torture, raid Iran and take their oil, has no respect if he thinks they would do that, which one of those statements did he not say

9855 2018-07-15 16:21:20 The estimated oil reserves in Colorado,Utah, and Wyoming alone is some 3 Trillion Barrels. That’s more then the entire world Has on hand. That does not include Alaska, the west or east coast, or the Gulf of Mexico.
We should not be buying oil from anywhere.
We need 50 refineries!

Fossil fuel for now, nuclear energy  - the sale of power plants that Flynn (it was Flynn, wasn't it ?) to arab oil producing countries fits that deal.

9960 2018-07-15 16:09:36 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
9961 2018-07-15 16:09:27 I'm never good at oil pasteeeels :---(((((((
9962 2018-07-15 16:09:11 51 years old. Back in my day we burned wood. Damn kids and their fancy oil!
9963 2018-07-15 16:09:08 The economic issues lie in Afrin and Deir Ezzor: Oil and farmland being restricted to YPG territory so the US has a decent hand when they negotiate with Syria
9964 2018-07-15 16:09:05 How about a collage of many different displays of this asshole eg gay pride colors covering him, dirty air/oil rigs, the always great $$$$ etc ? Can’t wait for the book. Any release date yet?
9965 2018-07-15 16:09:03 The oil flows from the head down the the hem. Hem is the lowest part of the garment. Be humble.  #unifiedchurch
9966 2018-07-15 16:08:55 I have not read it. 
It was my older ones favorite and he had come up with a brilliant idea that I should carve Poseidon on pumpkin for his fall book project which killed me 
Isiliye yaad hai, zero creative me had to burn the midnight oil 
9967 2018-07-15 16:08:45 You do know that we want to build pipelines to move our oil sands outside of Canada to have it processed and mixed because oil sands itself is not oil just yet.  We need to import oil from other countries either way. Caring about the environment is dropping fossil fuels.
9968 2018-07-15 16:08:41 Yeah, no-one wants to hear that they’ve been in decline since they lost control of the oil fields folllwing action by, wait for it, Obama. But sure, all the speeches donny has given about the action he’s taken, that’s solved it.

9970 2018-07-15 16:08:29 I’m trying to cook but apparently my mom switched the container for oil and made coffee in it so when I tried to put in oil when cooking onions coffee came out. 

She just thinks I caramlized the onions. This is why I shouldn’t be allowed in the kitchen

9974 2018-07-15 16:07:38 How did Venezuela taking control of their oil industry cause global oil prices to fall?
9975 2018-07-15 16:07:37 FDR on Dec. 8, 1941, in his patrician accent: “Friends, we must remind ourselves that throughout recorded history, nations have committed surprise attacks on  one another. But what is our country to do? US oil companies have business opportunities in Japan...”
9976 2018-07-15 16:07:07 Apparently, so why no issue sub 6% down under? I assume that they wet it at the crush? What is the basis for canola oil/moisture/admixture bonuses in Australia? @picadilly5 @Wilkschag @cropmad @WaddiPark @BigRoo_
9977 2018-07-15 16:07:04 Pakai rejoice yang argan oil tu!
9978 2018-07-15 16:07:00 Keep believing US fought the good fight and isn't crusading for gold , oil, and other profit
9979 2018-07-15 16:06:53 The plant is called oil palm, which produces the palm oil. So @IUCN was correct as it is oil palm plantation development
9980 2018-07-15 16:06:49 Bearings. Yanzu za ka ci inji alkuran. Use the right oil or start saving up for a new engine.
9981 2018-07-15 16:06:20 China sure won't stand for foreign control of enterprises within their country, not sure about Russia (oil?), but American enterprising (whore) entities will allow anything, regardless of the effect on "small people" Americans?
9982 2018-07-15 16:05:58 Also, oil and gas workers should wear hard hats.
9983 2018-07-15 16:05:42 Does Coconut oil clog your pores? 

We'll do a thread about this tomorrow. 

Put on your post notification. 


9984 2018-07-15 16:05:19 Im shook like really shook you don’t know about tea tree oil ... lol tea tree oil is life so many benefits
9985 2018-07-15 16:05:11 Just stained my new adidas track pants with a oil based sharpie FAWKK!!!
9986 2018-07-15 16:05:08 zoom in on hot men and cute dogs as well and that's it. Just because your parents hid the licquor in a cabinet doesn't mean kids are not gonna drink. Censorship pleases paternalistic governments but doesn't change minds
9987 2018-07-15 16:05:00 No, you just mopped the floor and then spilled half a litre of cooking oil all over it 
9988 2018-07-15 16:04:57 Yep. I personally think that oil one is more of a fashion trend than anything else and like the red jeans most kids wore in high school, it'll fade in time. But vape pens that burn weed, there's something that'll be around for a long while
9989 2018-07-15 16:04:52 Quick! Someone grab me a shot of coconut oil

9992 2018-07-15 16:04:31 He should do a demographic study on who drives his cars.  They are likely educated, believe in climate change, have heard of Peak oil and majority Democrat.
9993 2018-07-15 16:04:27 Fact check: Oil is not real estate.
9994 2018-07-15 16:04:18 Lively and expressive oil paintings by 
Art Lyubomir Kolarov 
9995 2018-07-15 16:04:17 He bought a pipeline with our money and almost 60% of our taxes go to the corporate infrastructure to keep them in business. How much more support does oil and gas need?
9996 2018-07-15 16:04:14 #UKOG Could hit 3p next week and that's before the oil is flowing #HH1

10002 2018-07-15 16:03:34 Our hearts are pounding because of how crazy the game is going. @lajiminmuhip #Croatia's World Cup performance has made us want to visit their country. Add oil #Croatia!!! #WorldCup2018
10003 2018-07-15 16:03:29 Crushers need the seed between 6 and 10% to ensure they can condition seed to get maximum oil extraction
10004 2018-07-15 16:03:28 britelabs, royal extracts, toxic carts, and any aftermarket oil that is real dab and not rosin or pressed from lowest shelf leafes. tip- turn that bitch over and the speed of the bubble going up will tell you whether youre getting high or not. ALSO hit it slow like a bong.
10005 2018-07-15 16:03:15 努力は努力。結果は結果。シラけつつノる。
頑張ろ
10006 2018-07-15 16:03:13 It's like AB is a cult with the oil industry calling the shots and everyone from Kenney to Notley worshiping at the throne. Believe us not your lying eyes!
10007 2018-07-15 16:03:06 Well, I think Britain staying of oil shale (and according to Wikipedia it is not the same as shale oil) for decades is much bigger achievement :) CO2 emissions using that one would be twice higher than from burning coal. And unlike coal, 46% of fuel turns into alkaline ash.
10008 2018-07-15 16:02:59 No Chicken licken in Mahalapye, I have to settle for Hungry Lion. All that oil
