11 2018-10-08 23:58:25 you have good intentions, thanks.  i don't really eat 22 eggs per day, though it'd be ok.  Love olive oil, though 2 tbls of it contains more SFA than a 6oz pork chop, FYI. hopefully you didn't include veggy oils with pufas? bad stuff.
12 2018-10-08 23:58:16 What's the value of oil if you own all the barrels in the world and lose the planet?

My dad & uncles risked their lives in a war against people like you.

60 2018-10-08 23:52:44 Your criticism is well-placed, but your moral authority to give it is lacking. You don't have a climate change plan robust enough to offset the increased CO2 emissions you're causing from your promotion of the oil and gas industries. If you think you're fooling the atmosphere...

63 2018-10-08 23:52:14 @jdevitt I doubt that. Oil is spiking and big investors will catch up on this very undervalued company that’s debt free

But if I was wondering-why wasn’t the media?
103 2018-10-08 23:46:47 Who has time to get their oil changed?

How do we reconcile the loss of jobs?

123 2018-10-08 23:44:56 4) In ur govt oil prices were low, hence Goldilocks of low inflation. Deleveraging wasn’t done, instead more spending in election year when u were Minister. Fiscal deficit went up. Growth was all import-driven, specially 5.8%, to treat traders, strong vote bank of PMLN? 2/2

141 2018-10-08 23:43:34 I was shocked when I saw what prop 112 actually was.  Who in their right mind would be opposed to a fracking site or oil drilling site being a minimum of 2500 ft from a school or hospital?

155 2018-10-08 23:41:43 We spend what we earn, we could survive without oil! We are competing at the highest level despite being significantly out-spent.   Credit can only go to the manager there, give him £300m more and he would dominate Europe, never mind equalling the net spend.

What will happen if federal lands are used to create energy and would you rather be dependent on Venezuela or Mexico to get your fuel oil?

They offer a discount for your first full set and then refills are only $60. I took care of mine so they wouldn’t fall out (no oil based eye products)

The stagnant wages as the "market booms";
The lust for "coal and oil" as waters rise;
"Illegal" children caged in freezing rooms;
And now, the frantic cry of "violent mobs",

177 2018-10-08 23:39:56 This tweet has no grounding in reality. Obama already fd up our healthcare system as indicated by sky rocketing premiums & deductibles. Obama also approved 2 oil pipelines on his watch, the Trans-Pecos & Commanche Trail pipelines. Also, I'm not wealthy but got a tax cut.
178 2018-10-08 23:39:50 Yeah, oil is hovering in the $85 range so your theory is bunk. Economics 101, higher tax rates result in less taxes collected as those in the higher tax brackets move their investments to more business friendly jurisdictions. It a simple correlation.
179 2018-10-08 23:39:35 why did I just pay $50 for an oil change 
180 2018-10-08 23:39:29 When I do baked potatoes I get that shit red hot like 500 degrees in the oven. Creamy interior potato chip exterior it’s heaven. All that shit needs is some salt pepper and olive oil to sing

182 2018-10-08 23:38:38 And when the Price of oil drops.  In NZ UP goes the petrol prices.  And they NEVER come back down properly..  More National Party propaganda from the Scribblers at the Granny
183 2018-10-08 23:38:35 Commodity Market 101. If producers CAN support prices, then they WILL. Also US support of $ by claims over oil isn't new. Only change is instrument used. Whereas investment banks funded via Petrodollars, prepay funding now is direct swap of T-bills for borrowed oil. Ask Mr Balan

192 2018-10-08 23:37:50 I've made oil - but not butter - u gonna use buds or trim ?
193 2018-10-08 23:37:33 Pipelines were even further split because Oil and Gas fall under Energy.  It’s the *transportation* of Oil and Gas through pipelines that puts that part of infrastructure under DOT/TSA.  *insert shrug emjoi here*
194 2018-10-08 23:37:30 Sounds like and look like snake oil cuz no amount of Real Scientist can predict or even n pinpoint accurate in predicting an earthquake. But it something that u Schaffer’s would buy and sell to the public. What a waste of money!

196 2018-10-08 23:37:23 CBC oil has a minimal if any medical  applications and for this reason why not legalize it. If it make someone feel it’s helping they should have access to it

198 2018-10-08 23:37:03 Let me help, Paige. Rouge Rocket's connection to betterhelp is that of a mult-level affiliate marketing campaign. Think about those essential oil companies and someone signing you up to also sell those oils. Good ol' American loophole.
199 2018-10-08 23:37:03 It’s really hard for me to imagine people still believe things like this, cities dump a ton of money into public transportation it just sucks. How do oil companies stop energy efficient cars, the big car companies control that and they couldn’t care less what oil companies think

202 2018-10-08 23:36:50 I feel the same way about Canada.
The British & Americans invaded & exploited the Middle East for oil in the 1900s. Colonialism has affected so many countries - it’s still having an effect on our First Nations people here.

205 2018-10-08 23:35:58 Sometimes you just need a baguette, some good olive oil, and a moment to yourself
206 2018-10-08 23:35:48 No, the reason is most oil comes into the port of Houston, the busiest port in the country by tonnage. So they built the refineries near it.
207 2018-10-08 23:35:47 That's fair. I do appreciate your opinions and time you put in sharing them. Have you spent much time in developing countries? Helping them adhere to particulate and drinking water standards that we take for granted in Canada would go alot further than punishing Canadian oil.
208 2018-10-08 23:35:37 This is supposed to subside soon, HOPEFULLY, cause at this point I'm inches away from using olive oil as mouthwash to counteract.
209 2018-10-08 23:35:37 YUP--and that in the face of PREPA having not made any of its legal debt service payments in nearly two years, and oil being higher than it has been since November 2014, and could well be headed even higher.

212 2018-10-08 23:35:17 Be cautious, I've seen no evidence, but it maybe a plot by Turkey-Qatar-Iran alliance to severe US-Saudi relations ahead of #IranSanctions on #oil that Saudi promised to replace by increased output. Ask Saudis for evidence proving their claims first, don't rush into conclusion

Let's hope you follow you own words and take action for #climatechange on behalf of this country in decisions to keep strict regulations on large oil/gas
215 2018-10-08 23:35:01 I was in third grade so I didn't realize how bad things could get. Like my mom trying to cook a 24-egg omlette on an oil stove. It might be done soon. Seriously, it was the downed power lines that were so bad. And houses with trees on them. We couldn't go outside for days. 
216 2018-10-08 23:34:56 It depends on type of wax, fragrance load (how much fragrance oil is put in) and how well it's mixed. Some fragrances are more potent than others as well.

226 2018-10-08 23:33:47 I only just found out coconut oil can be used as a heat protectant for hair...why didn't nobody tell me this??
227 2018-10-08 23:33:34 On a brighter note.

Anyone want to buy a used Ford.

Oil was recently changed, exact date, I don't remember.

"How does it shift?"

228 2018-10-08 23:33:28 You were right, @LichJim. Goblin Slayer had a badass first episode. From the cocky novices getting murked, to the Light spell being more important than the Cure Light Wounds, to the flaming oil, it was old-school D&D.
229 2018-10-08 23:33:24 I think he was planning to bury her in the oil drums too but overestimated their size. So he had to bury her. Maybe he was planning to go back and dig it deeper. But then Nicole got wind something was up and he didn't have time to dispose of everything.

232 2018-10-08 23:33:00 a had a comment from a mate yesterday and he told what defining about my artstyle and it's the fact it has an evil/look to it besides the messy oil style I have to it. I think my style has been defined :D
233 2018-10-08 23:32:57 @TrevorNcube @advocatemahere @MthuliNcube 
1. How can a nation with so much idle land and so many idle people import USD 20 million worth of soya beans a month to produce cooking oil?
234 2018-10-08 23:32:40 Not only Oil it's relevant in every aspect be it gold, real estate, stock market
235 2018-10-08 23:32:04 If one source of oil has a higher production impact than others, that would be important to determining whether producing more from that source vs others was a net environmental benefit or cost all else equal. That's why Scholz is making that claim.
236 2018-10-08 23:32:03 Unless someone wins 500 million in Powerball and is ready to buy a politician we are screwed. Both sides have dropped the ball on this one. Big oil owns you all.
237 2018-10-08 23:31:56 CongratsWhat kind of oil would you recommend this ball for?
238 2018-10-08 23:31:43 @SenDonnelly I'm watching your debate. #Hemp grows on farms, and has better profit margin than corn or beans. Want to help Farmers. Legalize hemp. Environmentally friendly plastic. Biodiesel from hemp seeds oil. Less cides, and fertilizer.
239 2018-10-08 23:31:22 It's very odd that the 2030 deadline for drastic (45%) CO2 emissions cuts lines up almost perfectly with the most probable date that oil depletion will collapse the economy.

Is this a coincidence or an inevitable consequence of the earth's carbon system? Is it good or bad news?

242 2018-10-08 23:31:01 I hope the U.S. will pull out of Germany and relocate its NATO forces to Poland. They have said they will spend $2 billion on infrastructure for the U.S., and I think it is a lesson to Germany, if they want to buy Russian Oil & Gas via N1 & N2 while the U.S. protects them.

261 2018-10-08 23:28:09 I recall in the late 1980s how the ecotards' incantational rhetoric was that the World was set to run out of oil by the year 2000.

In the 1970s, their insistence was that a new ice age would soon be upon us.

They just make up any old sensationalised drivel.
262 2018-10-08 23:28:05 Um, flour, water, baking powder, salt, sugar (yes I put a little sugar in mine) & oil, butter or shortening.

274 2018-10-08 23:27:01 Yes, exactly. It requires the style of planning and governance of post WWII, institutional megaprojects (when oil was $25/barrel). This doesn’t really fit with our current frameworks and finance models, let alone being able to guarantee that such promises will be fulfilled.
275 2018-10-08 23:26:57 Yes simply because of geography, most oil products are being imported already refined as marsden is old, inefficient and lack of locally sourced crude. Sending relatively small volumes to isolated water bound country with no pipes adds cost.
276 2018-10-08 23:26:52 Oh! and the Meyer Lemon Olive oil is great, too.
277 2018-10-08 23:26:52 They haven't shut up any of the other times it was too late and inevitable and didn't happen. See also global warming, global cooling, nuclear winter, ruining the air, running the water, can't use paper bags must use plastic, can't use plastic bags must use cloth, peak oil...
278 2018-10-08 23:26:46 W got into office because of (corrupted) Supreme Court.  Think about where we would be if Gore had been president.  No stupid Iraq War (Oil Halliburton Israel Saudis).  Surgical strike into Afghanistan instead of Mother of all bombs.  Supreme court not a model of virtue in past.

286 2018-10-08 23:26:17 I've known loads of friends sell their campers, they now sit in on a Saturday night watching 'Take me out' and 'Mrs Brown's Boys'.

p.s. I knew they would have to replace the valve stem oil seals on the cossie. Standard.
287 2018-10-08 23:26:13 Not that I game much anymore (too much grown man $#!+ to do like run a business, invest, raise kids, mow lawns, grow food,  fix brakes and change oil in cars) but my wife bought my last 2 Xboxes.

292 2018-10-08 23:25:57 @wes_wes614 can get some of this ordered seeing as he likes oiling himself up. He can oil up @DegaustKirk with it if he wants.
293 2018-10-08 23:25:40 What.... no Kavanaugh tank tops?
294 2018-10-08 23:25:40 Can not believe so many fell for his snake oil sales pitch.
295 2018-10-08 23:25:38 it’s all based BS stats. Same job, education, and experience and there is no gap.  A social worker and an oil worker = huge gap. If the gap were real, no company would ever hire a man because they could supposedly save 30% in salary hiring a female. It’s BS. @taylorswift13

We are not ready to destroy them and destroyed all efforts our grandparents have been giving us
302 2018-10-08 23:25:01 If you think other things matter, don't claim to be clean. The piece was making a claim the environmentalists were targeting Cdn oil for no reason since it's the cleanest and that's just not the case, at least according to any measure of environmental impact I've seen.
303 2018-10-08 23:24:57 You really only need a little butter (or olive oil) to sauté the vegetables.

335 2018-10-08 23:20:10 Hello Sarah, it seems high fuel prices will be around for some time as OPEC countries control output of crude oil. Oil producing countries need to increase production before Aus fuel prices start to decrease. We hope that when/if they do it'll return to around $1.20/L price mark.
336 2018-10-08 23:20:10 What is the CBD oil do for your training?

Which of these is ‘fleecing’ the motorist?
350 2018-10-08 23:17:41 Labour was already spending money it didn’t have before the financial crash, the crash just made it a lot worse. Remember the Treasury note left by labour “no money left”? Funny  eh ! Same as Venezuela spending soared under socialism when oil price collapsed they were fxxked.

363 2018-10-08 23:16:23 1/New Zealand’s daily demand for oil are 150K barrels, global consumption is 99.3 million barrels per day, last year it was 97.6.If New Zealand sank into the ocean it wouldn’t even drop below 99 million barrels a day and would catch up by the end of the year.

383 2018-10-08 23:14:09 I am here for the olive oil floater.
384 2018-10-08 23:14:09 So my car told me I need an oil change and I really wanna go back to driving a 2005 cause I don't need this type of pressure
385 2018-10-08 23:14:04 Oh and the actual impact of the Carbo Tax on Oilsands producers is roughly $0.18 per barrel. Our current oil differential due to the lack of off take capacity and the quality of our crude is $40.00.

Boil for 20 minutes covered
Then puree it all and jar it
399 2018-10-08 23:12:12 Wake up. #SaudiArabia has been attacking people 4 years. They are the biggest threat to peace in this world, not #Iran. The Saudi’s were responsible for 9/11, multiple human rights violations, the killing of innocent people in #Yemen. Yet we call them ally? Is the oil worth it?
400 2018-10-08 23:12:03 I suggest making a "carbon tax" on businesses, and making it so heavy that oil companies won't be able to afford not to optimize.

That would bias the market towards allowing alternative energy while also neutering the biggest player in political shilling to my knowledge.
401 2018-10-08 23:11:53 Go and check the same countries that had the same issue before the final plunge in the price of crude oil and see how they are fairing now compared to Nigeria. Eg Venezuela and others.

just waiting on the oil to finish heating up
410 2018-10-08 23:11:01 Bloody pain in the butt why did our ancestors have to worry about saving oil and candles for when it went to dark early or late am up to my ass in oil and candles these days from the ladies shop they must have stockpiled

417 2018-10-08 23:10:13 Japan at anything? We’re never going to win so much. Cities that refuse to take oil. “I think that that was it. Isn’t that nice?

420 2018-10-08 23:10:00 It took from 29 June 2017 at least to wind down previous market positions & put in place new ones. Physical oil market moves at tanker speed, financial oil market at light speed

422 2018-10-08 23:09:45 Didn't DJT just welcome someone from Saudi into the WH the other day? I realize he wants their oil but it is NOT a good place.
423 2018-10-08 23:09:41 I was told this oil change was going to be done in and hour and a half. It’s two and a half hours later and I’m still sitting here.
424 2018-10-08 23:09:21 The Lord told me to do the same thing for 6 months and to wear a head covering I’ve been doing it but I’ve been using other products and I wasn’t really sure if that was okay.. this was just a confirmation to me that I should use only the oil. Thanks for posting sis!
425 2018-10-08 23:09:08 I get the feeling Keith would love to vote Green, and put on a Hawaiian shirt, but just needs them a little more to the middle. Unfortunately as things are that's just not possible. Fossil fuels are dead, even though denialism is rampant, like flat earth, but LNG and oil instead.
426 2018-10-08 23:08:58 Of course I’d be allergic to Tea Tree Oil  my poor face

430 2018-10-08 23:07:53 If oil is pegged to dollar, when oil price goes up, so does $ and vice versa. Note this is even the case vs petrocurrencies
431 2018-10-08 23:07:43 Is that the same commercial where Beto hates the oil industry, so he hates Texas?

447 2018-10-08 23:05:48 More rhetoric in The Woodlands on tariffs for farmers and ranchers. The admin is negotiating unfair trade deficits. Only temporary and already producing results. What about millions of Oil and Gas jobs you want to end? Many farms and ranches depend on that revenue too. #NoToBeto
448 2018-10-08 23:05:38 They have no shame. They have never been anything but a destructive force for this entire country. The ultimate snake oil salesman.

457 2018-10-08 23:04:55 The benefit of oil vastly outweighs the costs, there’s a direct causality between oil consumption and massive increase in life expectancy.
458 2018-10-08 23:04:49 Ann....take it easy ....100 mil barrels of oil burnt DAILY/each 24 hours....we will get cooked by 2045 .......fuck politics....each elephant needs 53 gallons of water DAILY....500k African elephants will die in next 10 years....Artic meltdown...end of human life....2045
459 2018-10-08 23:04:26 "An oil painting takes an awful lot of time to dry though, doesn't it. If we did that we'd have to store the painting there and- no I'm getting ahead of myself. Pencil seems the most logical place to start."
460 2018-10-08 23:04:22 So you literally just put in oil?
461 2018-10-08 23:04:16 And there is no evidence of peak demand. Production and consumption of crude oil continues to grow. In virtually every country fossil fuels are still the dominant primary energy - even Germany's primary energy is still 90% fossil fuels.

463 2018-10-08 23:04:11 I'd say Wall Street/Big Oil behind it.

465 2018-10-08 23:04:02 Curly or wavy hair should use coconut oil as a conditioner because it protects new growth and adds shine.

471 2018-10-08 23:02:33 What? 
Scientists responsible for people not listening? They have warned about this for decades. 
Put the responsibility where it belongs. 
The oil industry, greedy "investors" and corrupt politicians. #BigOil and their lobbying, lying and lack of morale.
472 2018-10-08 23:02:26 There are only five viable energy sources to power civilisation on a large scale. Coal,oil,gas,hydroelectric and nuclear.

474 2018-10-08 23:02:09 It blows my mind how many people still believe the propaganda put out by the gas/oil/coal industry & the politicians they pay, even though there's proof they lied.
Cycles yes, but this is abnormal.
Are you really willing to risk it, for Corp. profit?
475 2018-10-08 23:02:08 Sorry your car was already clean and you said you gotta go to the dealer to get the oil change so I cannot take it.

477 2018-10-08 23:01:57 The USA has destroyed Venezuela with sanctions that force the world not to trade with them, they can't sell their oil and over seas assets have been seized.  You are talking crap professor, just a tool of the rich, making them richer while the poor starve

483 2018-10-08 23:01:09 When Tesla has provided enough electric vehicles that they don't need Saudi oil?
484 2018-10-08 23:01:05 I mean you could absolutely present it as an economic issue. Green energy is going to be a huge money spinner in the coming years. Oil is scarce. The sun is not. Also I feel like there’s gotta be punny slogan in there for green meaning eco and $$?
485 2018-10-08 23:01:00 And do not damage the oil and the sanctuary.

They’re tired of Buhari and want a change. Very soon they will insult him. 

It’s a circle because Nigeria is simple. 
Collect oil and vat revenues
Share it in Abuja
Utilize money 4 political patronage
Kill off the economy
Collect unrepayable loans
501 2018-10-08 22:58:49 I’m more of a salt, pepper, and some Worcestershire kinda guy myself. Filets I sear for about 2-3 min each side.  Remove from direct heat, apply olive oil. Oil hits flames and engulfs steak for maybe a min. Remove and let sit. Perfect rare/medium rare all the way through!

503 2018-10-08 22:58:42 It's a cozy relationship, by accepting only USD for oil they mop up US deficit spending thereby maintaining the value of the USD.  Oil backs the dollar.

508 2018-10-08 22:58:12 There isn’t much policy. Our oil growth has been driven by sheer luck. .Nigeria had the same issue and when prices fell, they entered recession because although they were “growing” it was all due to luck and oils contributed to a large portion of their GDP yet couldn’t b traced

515 2018-10-08 22:57:07 Oil itself isn't the problem, our collective use of it is, our enemy is the fact that our culture let our dependency get this far on it.
516 2018-10-08 22:57:06 Who are you going to believe, scientists or Republican politicians that are bought and paid for by big oil companies ?
517 2018-10-08 22:57:04 I guess I just don't think we have the luxury of waiting for them to change out of the goodness of their hearts at this point. They're going to go out of business eventually because oil, gas, and coal are finite, and for the sake of the planet we have to hasten that along.

531 2018-10-08 22:55:51 How is this a “weird” argument? I ask analogously similar questions if those who propagate the “Vancouver as most *livable* city” trope. It’s a way to show those afflicted that in none of theses metrics is cost-of-living used. So, what’s the metric for oil “cleanliness?”

550 2018-10-08 22:53:47 Humans using fossil fuels is being blamed for release of co2. Ask yourself in whose interest it is most to ensure the fossil fuels last as long as possible. Oil is what makes our big economies tick. Once its gone where is their money coming from.
551 2018-10-08 22:53:43 Oil lube with a latex condom, as it breaks down can also give a vagi. chemical burn.
552 2018-10-08 22:53:41 Most experts believe population will grow past 200 billion in 200 years. Atheist, God is in control. Remember peak oil lololol
553 2018-10-08 22:53:35 No, I'd rather have clean energy sources that we are more than capable of coming up with than relying on the oil standard of greed.
554 2018-10-08 22:53:21 oil corporations. #infowars
555 2018-10-08 22:53:19 I'm not going to name drop anyone because the situations everyone is trying to compare are water & oil in how different the terms of circumstances, contexts, & apologies. If you don't want to accept the apology from either, that's fine, but please know everyone's moved on but you
556 2018-10-08 22:53:15 Was going to order heating oil last week but put it off. Got online quotes from 2 Co's. Last week was     €384 & €385 for 500lts. Tonight €418 & €419. So they've put it up before the budget. Bastering gougers. #cblive #TonightVMT #Budget19

562 2018-10-08 22:52:29 It’s basil and parsley! Would be great in a Greek pasta dish with feta and olives.  Marinate the tomatoes in 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar of your choice.

564 2018-10-08 22:52:06 Just like peak oil...lololol wake up
565 2018-10-08 22:51:58 I’ve been putting castor oil on my brows to try and grow em thicker. I tried to do a pic collage with Day 1 and Day 14 and could not tell which was which. I guess it’s not working 
566 2018-10-08 22:51:57 So in short(tell me if I’m off) the recent rise in oil price has been due to US gov manipulation of futures positioning to using Tri-party contracts to prop US shale? so how will a neg shock in the price be negative US dollar?
567 2018-10-08 22:51:50 For what it's worth I just did two drops of CBD oil. I'm a little sleepy, but there are no side effects. I use it to help with my seizures. Quiets the brain a bit. They need to get it together. So over the medical community, and ignorance.
568 2018-10-08 22:51:47 She told you peak oil was real also...l9lolol
569 2018-10-08 22:51:20 She tried to tell us peak oil was real...lol

573 2018-10-08 22:51:08 Hi I eat to cope.
574 2018-10-08 22:51:00 was expecting similar tweet when BJP was in opposition and their leaders came on roads opposing congress of high fuel prices., although the crude oil prices those times were far more compared to present rates.
575 2018-10-08 22:50:55 @weatherchannel Pouring out salad oil (raw soybean oil) onto the waters of the Gulf of Mexico in front of the hurricane will deprive the storm of energy.  A few 100 gals are all that would be needed.  Even a gallon of soybean or canola oil on the surface would help KILL THE THING
576 2018-10-08 22:50:55 YA I GET IT WET THEN BRUSH/COMB IT N PUT SOME COCONUT OIL ON IT LMAO
577 2018-10-08 22:50:52 Today my diet has consisted of CBD oil, a bottle of water, and a large bucket of movie theater popcorn.

580 2018-10-08 22:50:38 Oil standard that started this year.....doesn’t seem like long for a “ standard” to take place. Gl with that theory.....
581 2018-10-08 22:50:29 Frankie knows to put this oil on her feet I don't know why she's talking to me like I'm stupid just go put the oil on your feet and be quiet. Lol
582 2018-10-08 22:50:19 The oil lobby and associates
583 2018-10-08 22:50:12 Also strongly disagree that the economy can't grow, suburban sprawl and military bloat have made the US vastly, vastly, VASTLY poorer than it would be by now. We've pissed away fortunes of oil and coal and land to make one generation not have to pay the cost of what they did
584 2018-10-08 22:50:07 this vape pen w. this oil in it had me caked asf for hours on my soul.. I done ate so much bs & took a nap, a shower & all i’m still high as hell.

586 2018-10-08 22:49:40 To clarify about the second World Climate Conference because I ran out of room:

There are complaints that said conference and the following Earth Summit in 1992 were sabotaged by oil lobbies.

I only have that cursory understanding though, and more investigation's needed.
587 2018-10-08 22:49:30 yes, i spray them with neem oil, etc.
588 2018-10-08 22:49:27 Like peak oil...lol

590 2018-10-08 22:49:11 It’s the same thing as Notley pretending to support Oil. We all know she is desperately trying to appeal to the citizens. It’s all a show. Globalists are easy enough to spot now a days and people are awake.

#weatherchange
594 2018-10-08 22:48:49 Well, also, 70% of emissions are caused by consumption of 20% of the world's population. It's not like we can just jail these execs and carry on buying oil from the good oil companies; there are none.
595 2018-10-08 22:48:45 Can’t believe the big companies failed to comment or get onboard with this, but can’t help but think all major companies around the world whatever they make leave a black stain on the planet. Oil,pharmaceuticals,auto, tech companies etc are all at it.
596 2018-10-08 22:48:43 Remember all those games when we said Maas out coached the other side????  Oh yeah, we’ve never said that. All hat, no cattle.

605 2018-10-08 22:47:11 Clinton believed in peak oil too lol
606 2018-10-08 22:47:08 In the 21st century, the Big tech is competing against the Big Oil for the rule over the serfdom and the mob. And the Big Banks are still behind the Big Oil but not for too long. #GlobalSystem

608 2018-10-08 22:47:02 Presidential alert. Snake oil salesmen on the loose!
609 2018-10-08 22:46:44 The stadium sponsorship should change from Lucas Oil to the Red Cross.  This team gets harder and harder to follow/enjoy each year just due to injuries. It just sucks.  @Colts
610 2018-10-08 22:46:41 India must barter and buy Venezuelan Oil. ONGC must have one leg in Venezuela. The deep state wants to rule oil rich country Venezuela. Till then the Venezuelan currency will be worthless. @PMOIndia @narendramodi @MEAIndia @CimGOI @DoC_GoI @PiyushGoyal @MinOfPower @Swamy39
611 2018-10-08 22:46:37 What about the 93 million people not included in the unemployment stats?
Why would we need to import workers?
Why can't we train some of these 93 million to fill the 5 million jobs like, carpenters, welders, plumbers, masons, oil workers etc. all high wage jobs?
612 2018-10-08 22:46:34 Exactly. People think SWIFT cutoff before was huge. It wasn’t; it was secondary to the EU blocking Iranian banks.  That’s what cut off oil sales, not SWIFT
613 2018-10-08 22:46:29 Like peak oil? Lol
614 2018-10-08 22:46:28 ya gal deserves lentil soup after class
615 2018-10-08 22:46:26 Actually if you moisturize it’s supposed to help because when your skin is oily it’s trying to produce more oil since it’s not getting any, ya dig? I use belif aqua bomb and it’s bomb.

Deniers: It is not true! If it is; Don't just complain, give me an alternative to crude oil, plastic, etc. ! 
Until then we will keep moving as fast as we can!
619 2018-10-08 22:46:08 To do that we need to reduce the pols who carry the water for the coal and oil corps!  Vote Nov 6!!
620 2018-10-08 22:46:03 That first part isn’t exactly true, they’re not spending their sovereign wealth funds on healthcare. Switzerland, of course, has no oil but yes, if you want the state to fund healthcare, you’ll have to pay more tax. QED.
621 2018-10-08 22:45:44 ahmedmyalr Absolutely. In fact, coconut oil or MCT oil both are utilized as energy (and can provide ketones) as opposed to being stored as fat. RT
622 2018-10-08 22:45:36 David, let’s give a big shout out to the Republicans and especially The Koch’s and Big Oil for stopping solutions when we had a chance.
623 2018-10-08 22:45:33 What works for one person may not work for another. And people have to be comfortable with a substance. Whether it's opioids, cannabis, CBD oil or Kratom they all should be available and we should all support one another not dis because it's about gaining our life back
624 2018-10-08 22:45:32 You know...there’s a reason investors will rather put their money on real estate and oil than support a young animation studio with plans to empower young people. We cry over it, deal with it...then find a comeback strategy. Same as a filmmaker’s experience with distribution
625 2018-10-08 22:45:29 Oil prices rallied to near four-year highs Wednesday, erasing earlier losses as markets weighed the largest rise in US crude inventories this year against looming oil sanctions against Iran.
626 2018-10-08 22:45:29 It's the oil harvested from chem trails.
627 2018-10-08 22:45:14 Darn I'd miss potatoes and pastry. We're fresh and as natural as poss. We cook in lard, not oil and no marg.
I'll watch that White Pill tonight 
628 2018-10-08 22:44:53 Oil boom that did not last wat? Chai goodnight
629 2018-10-08 22:44:52 Let’s see some math on this hyperbole!

The difference between the good oil we import in the East to the sludge we export in the West is about $15 / barrel. Your WCS discount is the cost of getting sludge all the way down to Gulf Refineries. All this info is easily available!
630 2018-10-08 22:44:45 It shouldn't be, but that's our reality with big oil profits over the environment, and those putting party before country voting in those who seek to destroy it for their means.
631 2018-10-08 22:44:42 Was cooking and got my ass beat by some hot oil
632 2018-10-08 22:44:40 the only essential oil i need is cbd
633 2018-10-08 22:44:38 Hey, guess what? Using oil makes our climate kill us. There should be high taxes on oil to drive innovation into other energy solutions.

But your donors don't like that message too well, do they?

 I'm casting my #Vote for #BetoForSenate on Oct 22- the start of early voting

639 2018-10-08 22:44:14 When your Trumper buddy says “the economy” Interest rates up 40%.  Gas and oil up 50%.  Housing up 7%. Inflation up 2.9%.  Wages STAGNANT. Trillion extra in debt. Good economy?? For who? #BlueWave2018
640 2018-10-08 22:43:58 So, based on what metric besides your cheerleading is Canada's oil the cleanest 5 million barrels per day in the world?
641 2018-10-08 22:43:50 The man-made global warming crowd is short sighted to the transition that has to come before all our energy needs can be met by solor & other sustainables, just as oil people like me can't dismiss the benefits of viable & fun & safe electric cars, which are cheaper to run.
642 2018-10-08 22:43:49 Thank you  It’s about 4 layers of oil paint 
643 2018-10-08 22:43:47 tea tree oil really is ur friend if ur trying to grow ur hair like I really do swear by it
644 2018-10-08 22:43:42 But what about the oil ???
645 2018-10-08 22:43:42 Now I’m checking ingredients on products and I’m finding so many things that have palm oil in them and it breaks my how much I have consumed in my life and I’ve contributed to the deforestation in one way or another 
646 2018-10-08 22:43:39 Instantly into the rejected bin then? (Which I picture as an oil drum set alight?)
647 2018-10-08 22:43:18 Trying a one-pot chicken and rice dish in the Instant Pot for tonight's dinner. Soy sauce, ginger, five-spice, sesame oil, chicken broth, mushrooms. And chicken, of course. Thigh meat.

655 2018-10-08 22:42:17 First you're wrong but even if you were right so what?  We wouldn't be the first small independent country without oil.  We are rich in many ways.
656 2018-10-08 22:42:05 Peppermint oil is the best. The feeling I get as I inhale it when I'm stressed is gold.
657 2018-10-08 22:41:54 if a person is lightskin + a Gemini...

658 2018-10-08 22:41:30 Not true
2009 oil $140 barrel  retail price $1.82
Assume that   same taxes as today 79c for purpose of this exercise
Wholesale per litre would have been 1.03 per litre  

2018 oil $82 per barrel retail price $2.50
All Tax today total 79c
Wholesale price per litre is $1.71
659 2018-10-08 22:41:25 A historical look back over the last twelve months might be in order to find out how we got to where we are. The 20 cents a liter hike directly after the election was inexplicable & now this whole Tax on Tax as just gone to far.   Are the Oil Companies and Govt working together ?
660 2018-10-08 22:41:22 Yes now. When you finish boiling the beans. Then put the palm oil and put in onions, it fries a little. Before you mix everything back Lmaooo

668 2018-10-08 22:40:47 I kinda felt like Maggie was a little over the top demanding all their oil lol. She turned into somewhat of a bitch when she was more caring in previous episodes. It’s an adjustment.
669 2018-10-08 22:40:46 It wont cure like that...oil needs to extracted and goes through a process to be cannabinoid oil.that is oil that can heal..we all have a cannabinoid system inside our bodies...youtube 2videos  key in the lock and run from the cure..

690 2018-10-08 22:38:43 @MusicSparrow and I enjoyed Soil Association coconut oil in #Percol Fairtrade & Organic Coffee Java (Sparrow), this evening who is belȳfan in @pgtips with @Alpro (riz & coconut is suitable for kinder over the age of 1) and great with British made Mqaret x With @FSC_IC T-pro! Fun
691 2018-10-08 22:38:14 You are becoming quite the comedian.  You do realize millions of people are laughing at you right? Goto India, China and every other third world country and sell your snake oil there first.  If saving the world is really your purpose.  #pantsuitsmatter
692 2018-10-08 22:38:03 Hope theres someone at the gates early doors, as got a feeling tankers first thing, with all the free flowing oil gushing into those storage tanks overnight 
693 2018-10-08 22:38:03 Oil looks very toppy here, I think you get your wish very soon
694 2018-10-08 22:37:59 less blood than you’d think actually but quite a lot of oil
695 2018-10-08 22:37:55 This is what happens when oil producers run a country with transparent policy and low corruption levels, and result in lower taxes and a strong economy.
Venezuela could have taken notes.
696 2018-10-08 22:37:53 tacha’s oil cleanser is pricey but he most glorious thing i have ever put on my skin.
697 2018-10-08 22:37:45 So what. If they're "stampeding" out of US bonds then what are they "stampeding" into with the dollars they receive for the bonds they've just sold? 
If they're buying oil with those dollars, then what are the oil sellers doing with them? Where do they go?
Oh, back to the Fed!
698 2018-10-08 22:37:42 Vote for politicians that are fully signed up to getting away from oil, coal and gas, and understand the science of climate change
699 2018-10-08 22:37:37 If the rematch consists of oil, I’m volunteering to oil those curves 
700 2018-10-08 22:37:28 Home Fries: Success! Paired with some eggs, sausage, and biscuits with apple butter.  Could have pre-cooked the potatoes a little less, but it worked out okay.  Tossed in butter, olive oil, garlic, S&P and seasoned salt. No pictures, so, uh, take my word for it?
701 2018-10-08 22:37:20 "Smokey Joe" Barton?
Same guy who apologized to the CEO of BP for the oil spill in LA.

708 2018-10-08 22:36:29 Oil is oil, and diamonds are diamonds. How they are extracted, is the determining factor. This is not an exageration, nor is it subjective. @calgaryherald @LiciaCorbella

We need to stop beating ourselves up and start championing what makes our energy resource, and Canada, great.
709 2018-10-08 22:36:21 okay, do u have an oil to fix my problems today bc I could use it  i'm waiting on new tires lololol
710 2018-10-08 22:36:08 My activist former-colleague (I work for an HIV NGO) hate Trudeau because he uses stuff like the socks to cover for him building oil pipelines through indigenous populations homes.
711 2018-10-08 22:35:59 Have you read this "Snake Oil" Daniel Hannah? I seem to recall that you said that the Swiss border was non existent.
712 2018-10-08 22:35:53 Heard that my entire life and there's still oil. Will run out one day not likely in my lifetime
713 2018-10-08 22:35:53 We should focus on American Energy First in America.  You know, using sunlight that hits America and wind that blows across America instead of oil that comes from not-America.

718 2018-10-08 22:34:48 I take a day off work and get the laundry put away, grocery shop, clean the house and make dinner - all while sick. 

My bf takes a day off and I change his oil, fill his tank, fix his windshield and order a new key. 

Something doesn’t sound right here.

720 2018-10-08 22:34:32 Can you link proof because I googled it and scanned the WSJ and couldn't find a single source saying China lifted the US oil tariff. Maybe you have a source that gets news very quickly?

722 2018-10-08 22:33:58 half gram oil carts hit me for pricing
723 2018-10-08 22:33:56 Suggestion:
If the oil co share is 94.3c/litre, add GST and be done with it.
Increase rego and RUC
Get ACC from adding it to sport fees, view from a more user pay perpective.
724 2018-10-08 22:33:51 Yeah that’s not why. Most of the refineries that refine oil into gasoline are along the gulf coast. The further you get from the gulf coast, the more expensive gas gets.
725 2018-10-08 22:33:45 Oil  platforms  are  shutting down  because of  Hurricane Michael.  Let  the price  gouging  begin
726 2018-10-08 22:33:42 @liamgallagher There's a revolution in the oil, All the cops are going bust, Cease is a word that you've heard, It's crude and got meaning G-A7-C-E
727 2018-10-08 22:33:42 tadashi has a bland design, is about as good at mixing as oil, and doesnt even have one really big and fun dynamic to save him
728 2018-10-08 22:33:40 Politicians always react to rising petrol prices but not rising rents because half the people own houses but hardly anyone owns oil refineries
729 2018-10-08 22:33:40 If you think oil companies will pay the tax and it won’t be passed onto consumers, think again
730 2018-10-08 22:33:33 I model complex oil and gas systems where we make financial decisions based upon these physical estimates.
Our models are often art.
The idea that we can meaningfully model an infinitely more complex system (climate) is preposterous.

735 2018-10-08 22:33:12 Agreed. It's a perfect storm at the moment. Certainly not all the fault of this government by any stretch. My point, though, is that @jacindaardern's first instinct is to blame the oil companies. As you've just outlined, it's way more complicated than that.

740 2018-10-08 22:32:45 Unfortunately for species survival, wealthy countries will need to fund infrastructure changes in developing nations. We aren’t just trying to save Canada & Canadians. The money from oil sands development will fund our & other less fortunate nations changes to infrastructure
741 2018-10-08 22:32:45 Gee! I didn’t know it was the NDPS fault that oil tanked due to the Saudis dropping prices a year before the election? And btw that’s not Shannon Phillips in the picture that was taken 2 years before the election when Notley turned down the LEAP manifesto. Nice try though
742 2018-10-08 22:32:36 You know how CRUEL you have to be to dump a person, yet your own children in oil tanks?
743 2018-10-08 22:32:31 And me that drill vagina!... Oil spillage lol
744 2018-10-08 22:32:30 Not true. Basic
2009 oil $140 barrel  retail price $1.82
Assume that   same taxes as today 79c for purpose of this exercise
Wholesale per litre would have been 1.03 per litre  

2018 oil $82 per barrel retail price $2.50
All Tax today total 79c
Wholesale price per litre is $1.71
745 2018-10-08 22:32:22 Maybe just stop being at those rallies- no room for all the lies. Better write good articles about oil prices; climate change, interviews with roommates of prof Ford.

749 2018-10-08 22:32:03 Don’t forget the oil that isn’t counted because it doesn’t come ashore, or the money that isn’t made because the Tories have given the only l companies so many big tax breaks.  Would Scotland do the same not a chance Indy means doing things differently.
750 2018-10-08 22:32:00 Three candidates to the Senate of Brazil who were well positioned in the polls were strangely not elected: Eduardo Suplicy, Dilma Rousseff and Roberto Requião. They defended the Brazilian monopoly of our oil that bothers the gringo fucking thieves.
751 2018-10-08 22:31:46 1/In 1939 US was biggest oil producer 70%,USSR and Venezuela next two and 10-15% rest of world combined.Germany used synthetic. Germany needed oil from ether US,Venezuela or take Soviet oil fields in Caucasus.

753 2018-10-08 22:31:30 It’s in our recognised maritime territory. There are strict international laws on that. And before you wheel out the ‘what if Shetland goes indy’chestnut, the same laws mean it would only get a little inshore water with its enclave status and almost none of the oil and gas fields

756 2018-10-08 22:31:23 there is a global crisis pull back in Emerging Markets, weakening EM currencies vs USD, a trade war between China & US, rising oil + diplomatic spat between Trump & Saudis.

764 2018-10-08 22:30:38 West Virginia?  The World would collapse without coal. And gas. And oil. And ...
The stupidity is how few seem to appreciate this.
I concede we need to eliminate our dependence on these energy sources.
I dispute that the way we're going about this will EVER be successful.
765 2018-10-08 22:30:34 I recently had a twitter exchange with a TO resident that felt the solution to AB woes would just be to “pay us a few billion dollars” to leave it in the ground while at the same time continue to import oil for his needs. Extremely frustrating and maddening.
766 2018-10-08 22:30:28 Here come all the triggered MAGA people saying they’re gonna boycott her music and run her out of business , blah blah blah. That’s a lot of hot air from people who voted for a reality star/snake oil salesman who has exactly zero political or diplomatic experience at all

768 2018-10-08 22:30:18 That is a good point. To play the devil's advocate, for decades US imported oil from the Middle East. Now US is one of the biggest oil producers and soon won't have to rely that much on Arab states. How do you think that fits into the picture?
769 2018-10-08 22:30:03 I am only 10 yrs younger than you. We both have lived and thrived in America regardless of who was POTUS. Never did I feel out place in America.. never. I disagreed with the policies of Carter & Obama but never would I abandon America.
770 2018-10-08 22:30:01 @cvpayne Why was Beto O'Rourke who is running against Cruz in Texas actually interviewed?  He talks about trade but wants to add a huge tax on oil and gas in Texas.  One of the biggest revenue that keeps Texas income tax free.  Puff piece anyone?  Geez.
771 2018-10-08 22:29:55 But I am sure he doesn’t feel out of place counting all the money he made off his generation at the box office! What a ungrateful hypocrite. I haven’t been to a movie in over a year! YouTube has better entertainment!!!!

779 2018-10-08 22:29:10 Isn't Redford a republican?
780 2018-10-08 22:29:04 these companies take oil, metal, gold, precious minerals we can't make again, and they press it into a grotesque abomination, a shape that looks useful but isn't. we can't stop them. they just keep taking it. nobody can tell them to stop ruining our resources.

782 2018-10-08 22:28:49 @realDonaldTrump For all the work that I've done to you in these two years, this is the least thing you can do for us. Do not ruin our relations more than this and finish the damaged oil's work, it's enough

785 2018-10-08 22:28:36 When you take into account oil company profits, if you took 20c/litre off the price of petrol, the oil company would probably make a loss.

787 2018-10-08 22:28:21 @realDonaldTrump President Trump On November 4 I will leave Twitter and rest, I want to make it easy for you to win. Do not do anything to leave you, I'm definitely going to be on the fourth of November. Make my last request and finish the Iranian oil work.
788 2018-10-08 22:28:02 Be sure to listen to @Marketplace tonight to hear my story on the Kansas oil and gas industry. It starts at 5:30 on @KMUW
789 2018-10-08 22:27:55 Who do you think is the 2nd largest oil company in the Gulf of Mexico? British Petroleum, the company that hired & caused(?) the Deepwater Horizon blowout.  It won’t be long before BP starts prospecting off East Coast...
790 2018-10-08 22:27:52 And can I have all your houses?
791 2018-10-08 22:27:52 unless they adapt to eating oil executives I'm not sure they will put a dent in the problems we have made
792 2018-10-08 22:27:40 I have to wait 2 hours and 30 min for an oil change so I guess now’s the perfect time to watch big mouth
793 2018-10-08 22:27:38 .@JustinTrudeau and @cathmckenna don't have a climate plan worthy of the name. It's a charade. It won't achieve any of the stated objectives (set by Stephen Harper) and it doesn't offset the increase in CO2 emissions caused by their pro-gas and oil industry policies.
794 2018-10-08 22:27:32 Sounds like maybe purposeful?...oil spill in the ocean...great for the eco system
795 2018-10-08 22:27:19 Cover the baby in baby oil. Should make for some entertainment. Just saying.
796 2018-10-08 22:27:19 Nah had to pick up Duncan. Oil change,a detail (that was shitty)and there was a recall on my tailgate that had to be fixed ( tail bed is now scratched)and rotate my tires

798 2018-10-08 22:27:09 I love trick questions, but I've got a barrel of oil and a hose in the bed of my truck, so good to go.  #fact
799 2018-10-08 22:26:56 I sliced it, and browned it briefly in a hot skillet with some olive oil, and then baked on foil in a 350 oven for about 20 minutes. Sprinkled some season salt and parm cheese before baking. It’s Trader Joe’s polenta, I always keep it around. Good stuff. Shelf stable.
800 2018-10-08 22:26:51 Lol oil change doesn't take two hours
801 2018-10-08 22:26:16 Me spilling 5 gallons of oil all over the garage floor is a direct representation of how my day has gone.
802 2018-10-08 22:26:13 And Yes Cars have to be either electric Or Hydrogen powered as Burning petrol and diesel is part of The problem along with burning oil, coal and gas fired Power stations we need more renewable energy and Yes spend More money cleaning up OUR Mess.
803 2018-10-08 22:26:07 Switzerland and other Nordic country’s subsidies come from oil to prop up their healthcare. Remember the same oil democrats want to get away from. And fact two, what doesn’t get subsidized by oil means you’re gonna pay at least 50 percent of your wages in taxes
804 2018-10-08 22:26:04 or Oil
805 2018-10-08 22:25:59 My take is US has since Q1 2018 used Enron-style tripartite prepay contracts inc #BigLong fund futures position to fund shale oil reserves & macro manipulate/support Brent oil price. Through 2009/2014 US funding/manipulation was intermediated (as with Enron) by investment banks
806 2018-10-08 22:25:39 Tell that to your party and big oil
807 2018-10-08 22:24:43 Putting 1 1/4 pounds of meat on a sandwich with some peppers and olive oil doesn’t make it Italian.

809 2018-10-08 22:24:39 BC has so many nat.gas reserve. Why do Alberta try to increase API gravity of sand oil by using this reserve? High API means high boxes

West-east line also neccessary.
810 2018-10-08 22:24:32 Actually, even snake oil has some type of substance that isn’t water in it, unlike homeopathy 
811 2018-10-08 22:24:31 Wow, I think 7 took me a couple of weeks, good for you!!!!  I seemed to lose way more if I remembered to take MCT oil in that day.  I don't like the taste, you can put it on salad or in coffee.  I put it in gel capsules and just swallow it.  I didn't track my macros. Do you?

822 2018-10-08 22:22:17 My mom has the same issue. We believe that it is a certain oil in which food items are cooked that causes this issue.
823 2018-10-08 22:22:13 @gennarocontaldo how much olive oil do you consume in a month! You must do a litre easy?

825 2018-10-08 22:21:50 Kuz u said evil anointing oil
Us uses to pray over. Like holly water
826 2018-10-08 22:21:34 Went indoor rock climbing for the first time, cried at church (message hit deep), started my new canvas with my new oil paint, volunteered at a women’s shelter, learned how to roll a blunt (didn’t smoke it though), and received fresh beautiful flowers. Best 3 days ever.
827 2018-10-08 22:21:26 I need to get my oil changed soon but i don’t wanna pay for the shit  over adulting y’all.
828 2018-10-08 22:21:24 Inflation is the real estate developer salve.  @realDonaldTrump is igniting inflation with irresponsible and unwarranted tax cuts, tariffs, broken treaties, and sanctions against Iran and Venezuela (that contribute to rising oil prices).
829 2018-10-08 22:21:18 I seriously am going to look into making the holy anointing oil from Exodus in both the Hebrew and NKJV Bibles (the Hebrew version has Cannabis)

22 Then the Lord said to Moses, 23 “Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels[a] of liquid myrrh,
830 2018-10-08 22:21:17  Bundle One

So the first bundle includes: 

- a large natural sponge
- one natural olive oil soap
- one aloe Vera soap
- one Aloe vera & Vitamin E face and body scrub 

The price isn’t including post & packaging which depends on where you live.
831 2018-10-08 22:21:14 Aloe vera is soo good, and I realized not too long ago that my hair doesn't like coconut oil by itself. It has to be mixed with something else.
832 2018-10-08 22:21:07 The issue of oil demand is more a factor on population. 1bn+ people in Africa, 1bn+ people in South Asia and then another 1bn+ in China. Then add a yearly depletion rate of 4.5pct (and I am being conservative there). How does the math add up ?
833 2018-10-08 22:20:56 Poundland are selling tea tree oil for obvs £1. Go get yourself a bargain!
834 2018-10-08 22:20:52 It’s not technically makeup remover but jojoba oil is the BOMB. I basically only use oil to take off makeup. Goop it around then wash with your cleanser of choice.
835 2018-10-08 22:20:33 $cei oil price has moved a fair amount in last hour or so REAL CLOSE TO BEING GREEN , OTHER COUNTRYS MIGHT BE ON BOARD WITH ANTI IRANIAN OIL ! #oilandgas

837 2018-10-08 22:20:16 Wat y’all use coconut oil for
838 2018-10-08 22:20:07 @lbc The famin happened due to resources being diverted to the East where Japan had taken Burma and were intent on taking India, and then the oil fields in the ME. In all out war it was an unfortunately necessary.
839 2018-10-08 22:19:54 Are you suggesting that U.K. would not trade with an Indy Scotland?

UK will be sitting in the dark and in the the cold!
We sell electricity to England and of course gas and oil

Maybe Putin will give you a Quote?

840 2018-10-08 22:19:43 Honestly what i think everyone has got so emotional about all the drama, now thats the all they care about. 
Instead of making things better some people are just there to put oil on fire or to bait people if they don't pick a side.
Cg would be received if the drama wasn't up 24/7
841 2018-10-08 22:19:38 we can all imagine what went down afterwards fjdjdj with the help of some olive oil or whatever
842 2018-10-08 22:19:35 Let's hope oil turns down so we won't have too much inflation? 
843 2018-10-08 22:19:25 Thinking about trying #CBD oil to help the #GVH in my eyes. I hate waiting for specialists to call.
844 2018-10-08 22:19:22 Not saying it is going to happen....I doubt the states that control oil production, food, cotton, biofuels, ammo, etc. would EVER agree to this. Just dumbfounded they would even be screaming this unconstitutional stuff and people buy it.
845 2018-10-08 22:19:11 Most likely India will continue to import oil from Iran even after October, It seems US administration is considering waiver for some buyers like India.
846 2018-10-08 22:19:00 < #油song の曲目から、中の人が主に誰のペンか想像がつくと思います…ふふっ
847 2018-10-08 22:18:46 I don't think so. Not holding my breath.  No one seems brave enough to tackle the oil industry.
848 2018-10-08 22:18:46 Paying almost $100 for an oil change Is dead

851 2018-10-08 22:18:30 Ill find it & send you the link. The oil works great with no side effects.  Im in pain 24/7/365 and have severe epilepsy. Is why I noticed it on the news.
852 2018-10-08 22:18:17 #nltraffic FILL UP YOUR TANK !!

Irving Oil Refinery in NB just blew up. With a 300,000 barrel a day output..one of the highest in Canada. The system can’t react that fast to recover. I expect disruptions in diesel and gas deliveries.
853 2018-10-08 22:18:16 Wax pens are not my thing but this oil pen is a life saver 
854 2018-10-08 22:18:09 Send consignment to Harare my brother unfortunately its just that one shop no cooking oil this side of the country....
855 2018-10-08 22:18:07 lmaoo at least your body is a little use to the vegetable oil, you gotta leave the kitchen when that fab on the fire.
856 2018-10-08 22:18:04 When making melted chocolate (a bruche) spray a stainless steel bowl with nonstick cooking oil, so the chocolate don't stick!..
857 2018-10-08 22:17:56 Yes and I use to remove my makeup too most ppl don’t recommend putting oil on your face but it works for me
858 2018-10-08 22:17:33 The Liberals' pro-gas and oil policies from subsidies to pipelines causes an increase in CO2 emissions that is not offset by their tepid carbon price and climate change 'framework.' It's a political con, like electoral reform and open and transparent government.
859 2018-10-08 22:17:31 Both actually. I leave it in for a min, wash it out and then pick/oil my beard.
860 2018-10-08 22:17:23 only a matter of time before the shale oil gold rush comes crashing down. #FiniteResources
861 2018-10-08 22:17:02 I used half bacon fat and half olive oil in my salad today and now my salad kinda has the gormet burger undertone and I am legit so happy about it. 
To health!
862 2018-10-08 22:16:58 //Well
Time to get the pan and some oil ready—
863 2018-10-08 22:16:47 I believe in recycling.   I believe in burning good wood.  I believe you shouldn't throw prescription pills in the toilet or lawnmower oil or paint in the garbage can.  You should dispose of needles properly. I believe Al should give up his private jets and downsize to 900 sq. ft
864 2018-10-08 22:16:46 I don’t suggest foaming cleansers from any brand. Especially for oily skin types. They have a high pH that strips your skin and dries it out which results in excess oil production.
865 2018-10-08 22:16:45 Educational and thought provoking.
Needs subtitles for some Norwegian interviews to get they’re points  across- stat oil CEO interview needs edited. Reduce but don’t cut genetics. Keep up the great work!

867 2018-10-08 22:16:41 Thinking about trying CBD Oil to see if it helps the GVH in my eyes. It can't hurt as much as waiting for the specialist to call......
868 2018-10-08 22:16:40 Bob Corker que tiene su historia en shady businesses, se retira para dedicarse al oil business y que casualidad que visita un país petrolero. , el es solo un norteamericano visitando Venezuela, no representa la Trump administration. Aunque así lo quiere vender el régimen.
869 2018-10-08 22:16:33 Heard @AndrewScheer on CBC going on about 'clean oil' Canada would be produce in comparison to the globe. 'How would he know' struck me as I considered all the studies the gov has blocked. How about that #KinderMorgan spill in Surrey today or the St. John explosion? Good times!
870 2018-10-08 22:16:32 Electric vehicles were wide spred in the late 1800s but the money involved in oil at the time pushed this back and has continued to do so ever since

872 2018-10-08 22:16:20 The first person to ever put plantain in oil must have been shooketh.
873 2018-10-08 22:16:13 If you think burning a trillion barrels of oil, a trillion tonnes of coal and a trillion cubic metres of gas inside a wafer thin atmosphere won't change our climate significantly then seek psychological treatment before you breed.
874 2018-10-08 22:16:10 i'm not arguing for oil, i'm saying the words fossil fuel are fundamentally misleading in a way which tends to push the price up

see #peakoil
875 2018-10-08 22:16:00 I’m glad I got my oil changed already
876 2018-10-08 22:16:00 I love my cousin and all but I am not a taxi. And I just got my oil changed? No.

885 2018-10-08 22:15:12 not be allowed to use natural resources ( like oil)freely at their will . The fact that covers almost everything i.e petrol, diesel, electricity means we will be prevented from using these freely in future even if we are willing to foot the bill. We will be prevented from.....

890 2018-10-08 22:14:52 if crude oil is a "fossil fuel" and presumably organic then why are there hydrocarbon lakes on titan?

doesnt this suggest hydrocarbons result from planetary processes and not old dinos and ferns???


891 2018-10-08 22:14:43 Ahah oh gosh... we're close to absurdity! West made hell out of Lybia because they wanted to control its oil and now Putin is the one waging the migrant crisis? Pathetic not even worth my time...

896 2018-10-08 22:13:29 Plus I have my doubts if the Saudis do have ANY spare capacity available. Then if one gets issues like we had in Libya or Nigeria then what happens ? Oil will have to be rationed by price. And I can tell you upfront that is much higher than 100.

898 2018-10-08 22:13:12 Science denial is not a plan Tom.  I consider clear cutting pretty radical, Tom.  I considered oil wells in natural park a travesty. I remember when Lake Erie was burning.  It cost to ignore environment, it just doesn’t cost your donors, the Kochs.

907 2018-10-08 22:11:35 Bigger worry is his connections to PNAC, since he was there since beginning.  They got W elected in FL, he helped Cheney with energy meeting in Mar. 2001 to divide Iraq oil fields, then 9-11, then Liberty U lawyers, torture, this man has an agenda.
Not just 3 women, War Crimes.
908 2018-10-08 22:11:30 I disagree. Global oil demand keeps on growing every year (maybe slower or faster but the consensus that it is still growing) while depletion means that new sources for 4.5m bpd need to be discovered. The math is just not adding up.
909 2018-10-08 22:11:23 #Newsnight tory message comparing #Universalcredit to an engine amd feeding it petrol. If you run an engine with no oil in it for 6 weeks it'll grind to a halt.
910 2018-10-08 22:11:20 All this oil, accumulated over millions of years, all lit up in only a couple hundred years, the results should be quite interesting.
911 2018-10-08 22:11:00 to be fair the seizing of that much oil wealth and land in Iraq was pretty damn close to a "success"

They just wanted all of greater syria, so like fell way short of the mark
912 2018-10-08 22:10:57 Hot oil treatment + deep condition 
913 2018-10-08 22:10:53 Tech is starting to recycle them. In the long run, they will be less harmful to the environment than oil drilling and oil burning.

921 2018-10-08 22:09:48 I think that the KSA should never have been made to exist in its present form . The Roosevelt deal with the desert people was not intended to become a lackey of Israel ,but then Standard Oil was bestowed with the development of the oil fields and that changed it for the worse.
922 2018-10-08 22:09:39 i should try it , i never heard of no one using the oil
923 2018-10-08 22:09:38 Your right,do some research...you get over 2 gallon of ethanol for every bushel of corn not to mention the corn oil they get during the process and the biproduct I know will blow your mind...distillers grain..and I can feed to my cows...nothing is wasted...try that with crude

944 2018-10-08 22:06:30 The west wants oil from your countries & will lie & kill to get it. We live in a sick world.
945 2018-10-08 22:06:21 It’s been happening for years and to stop scottish export figures looking good on the books WM made sure all Scottish goods ports were closed down and investment (thanks to Scotland’s oil) went to English ports.
946 2018-10-08 22:06:16 Greenies are going nuts over the latest IPCC climate report like new scripture has been revealed.

But since the massive Rio Climate Summit in '92, global oil use is up 40% and global coal use is up 70%.

Simply put, we'll stop using them when they run out.
947 2018-10-08 22:06:15 @rep_stevewomack says man doesn't change the climate cuz it's changing all the time and bible stuff, we should totally be drilling for that oil and digging that coal. REGULATIONS BAD! CORPORATIONS WILL FIX IT!

953 2018-10-08 22:05:03 How are we still so bad at not spilling millions of gallons of oil into the sea?
954 2018-10-08 22:04:57 Boringly interesting sidebar: real snake oil is a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from the Chinese water snake, similar to fish oil; but it was so expensive that 19th century U.S. con men sold fake snake oil; that's why Americans say "snake oil" to mean "fake."

959 2018-10-08 22:04:36 The Federal Tax Credit for electric vehicle purchases was written to be self-limiting. 
It phases out after any manufacturer surpasses 200,000 plug-in vehicle sales in a quarter. 
There's no reason to take action... unless you're a senator from a state dependent on oil revenue

978 2018-10-08 22:02:28 We each need to make drastic changes to prevent climate change is false: oil executives Georg, who lives in a McMansion and does 71% of the polluting, is an outlier and should be forced to make most of the changes

984 2018-10-08 22:01:45 So you are saying Angus are lying? And there is no oil? No doubt about it your pictures are great but your opinions and questionable agenda are way off. Stick to photography mate u knowledge is limited at best on oil.
985 2018-10-08 22:01:44 Didn’t have any body lotion at Scott’s so I absolutely covered myself in coconut oil and it’s the worst decision I think I’ve made in a while
986 2018-10-08 22:01:43 this is completely false. deaths/TWh/yr from coal, gas, oil, and nuclear-based r 24, 3, 19.2, and 0.052, respectively. modern nuclear plant r even safer than that. solar panels r made of polluting materials. wind turbine, coal mine, and oil rig workers r exposed to toxins

988 2018-10-08 22:01:31 does anyone ever Recall the $7 billion "sustainability fund"? 

If you add in the sustainability fund, Alberta conservatives overspent some $22 billion since Klein quit politics

1011 2018-10-08 21:59:52 You cann't confront simultaneously Iran(Shiites) and Saudi Arabia(sunnies). You'd get an oil embargo, oil price above 200 u$/bbl, economic crisis= increase in infant mortality &decrease in life expectancy, unemployment, family crises& wars.Let the Arabs solve their problems alone
1012 2018-10-08 21:59:49  Dam banane ke paise nahi hai war ladenge yeh. Do you know the expense of a War, your country dont even have supply of oil for more than 15 days, Dont be a war monger if you dont know the economics of a war.

1014 2018-10-08 21:59:26 That is precisely President Trump is combating. By pressuring the EU over the Nord Stream 1 & 2 pipelines supplying the EU with Oil & Gas, and by pressuring NATO to increase its defense spending and selling missile defense to Poland, the U.S. is addressing Russian subversion.

1024 2018-10-08 21:58:33 My university attempted to talk about alt-ac but really only brought in people who do industry microbiology or bio-engineering stuff, not relevant to all of us in STEM fields. It was like, "be a biologist for an oil company, or be an academic" (Granted this was in east Texas).
1025 2018-10-08 21:58:30 You 1/2, kinda get it. 
Oil, gas, fracking, coal = major, harmful polluters and drivers of warming and deaths by pollution and increasingly powerful hurricanes (warm surface water is storm red bull)
The construction waste and concrete industry = harmful polluters.
Trees are good.
1026 2018-10-08 21:58:27 I thought it was just water? Snake oil might at least be useful, in cases where you need oil or antivenom. Water is useful for hydration. But it's not even water it's just little drops and cute round little placebos.
1027 2018-10-08 21:58:22 You’re right. Thank god I got outta there. My gas comes from literally right down the street. Houston is one of biggest gas producers of the world. Oil rigs everywhere here.

They make chemicals that are used in both Fracking and Tar Sands, they do not promote EV, they invest heavily in FF and FF infrastructure, they fund the war for oil.

1042 2018-10-08 21:56:57 Oil prices up, dollar down. Can’t do much about oil price but dollar directly related to low business confidence and interest rates. Fuel prices up worldwide but worse here because of recent tax hikes and that low dollar.

1056 2018-10-08 21:55:37 I’ve wanted to do this, too! Palm oil is a liiiiiittle harder to eliminate than most of the other bad stuff, but of course, not impossible, just another thing to manoeuvre around. :)

1062 2018-10-08 21:55:02 1) As the international community: We want to attract capitals in our state; we reduce taxes for businesses; give free hands to them to produced everything they want including weapons; extract oil, gas and other natural resources as mush as they can despite environmental damages
1063 2018-10-08 21:54:56 The aggression is about the spratleys and oil, that’s about it.  They are working to avoid needing it with alt energy jobs and sources of energy.  But to think their military is a threat... meh, not really.  

Russia has been the bigger help, not our trade.
1064 2018-10-08 21:54:52 While retailers and manufacturers of branded foods are rushing to buy certified "sustainable" palm oil that does not destroy rainforests, animal feed manufacturers show "little awareness of sustainability". British imports of sustainable palm kernel meal are precisely zero.

1089 2018-10-08 21:51:59 Where is the power going to come from to recharge the batteries..coal...oil...wind...sun...
unicorn farts?
1090 2018-10-08 21:51:58 We really bout to be going to war for no only oil, but water on top of that? Insanity, this lawyer shit might really be put on a back burner while I get drafted in the years to come.
1091 2018-10-08 21:51:55 Yes yes you are. My mom says I must swallow cod liver oil every day and I’m so happy I live alone
1092 2018-10-08 21:51:50 It’s written by “The” scientific authorities on climatology as recognised by the science community. It is not written by third rate scientists paid off by oil companies who also fund the Republican Party in America. Think man !
1093 2018-10-08 21:51:49 Chief buy me one oil block
1094 2018-10-08 21:51:46 Yep - he can choose how and when he calls in BKP - he has loads of on-site storage & as we all know tests don't run "flat out" they are choked back or run for a short period in order to prove some scenario or other - what we do know with certainty is BKP have taken oil from site
1095 2018-10-08 21:51:33 So no more coal, oil and gas and tax meat and dairy.
By dumping these top earning industries,  NZ is immediately sunk in debt with no scaled up production to replace either, we come a couple of steps closer to Venezuela.   Where's the big plan- the future is blank....
1096 2018-10-08 21:51:28 Not helping? Deporting dangerous illegal immigrants, biggest tax reduction in history, renegotiating trade deals in our favor, reducing/removing tariffs on our exports, increasing exports, increased exports of oil and natural gas, closing in on energy independance, NoKo not
1097 2018-10-08 21:51:20 Any oil around? Veg, olive, baby? You can pour it on the sticky and work it loose
1098 2018-10-08 21:51:13 I’m at an oil change place, editing a poetry book written by one of my favorite contemporary poets, and when I got to the “thank you for your support” section, found my name. I guess what I’m saying is the people at Larry’s Automotive probably wonder why I’m crying.
1099 2018-10-08 21:50:49 If you use olive oil to fry chicken it’s not fried chicken no more it’s olive chicken 
1100 2018-10-08 21:50:28 Elon. You can't be popular with the car maker's or the oil companies. Info wars are real. 
You should watch your back more than you do and start fighting fire with fire.
1101 2018-10-08 21:50:27 his mom makes him wear posture shoes and take castor oil to ward off unseemly thoughts
1102 2018-10-08 21:50:20 Lost $41 billion? How, did the oil go bad in the barrels? smh maaaaaan you better come better than That!
1103 2018-10-08 21:50:09 It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, And his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil. Isaiah 10:27
1104 2018-10-08 21:50:05 Fox News is on at the oil change place. I’m going to be sick. This is the worst station.
1105 2018-10-08 21:49:54 Isn't this that point in time when the people in the Castle dump hot burning oil on the IDIOT'S AT THE GATE??
1106 2018-10-08 21:49:47 It’s all ICE vehicles being advertised in the MSM. Also oil companies. These powerful interests are trying to destroy TESLA now that so many vehicles are finally hitting roads everywhere. TESLA is a huge threat to the status quo.
1107 2018-10-08 21:49:47 Yes! You know you’re Asian when you pack home cooked meals for traveling, and have tiger oil in your purse (I’m guilty for both ) 
1108 2018-10-08 21:49:30 Consider this ... do not hurt the economy.  Build from strength not weakness.  Unless you like paying $30 billion each year on foreign oil from countries with zero enviro policies or regulation:  saudi arabia, nigeria, iran, iraq, venezuela etc #carbontax #climatechange
1109 2018-10-08 21:49:24 We’ve reached the media break of the 3rd period. Oil Barons continue to lead the @DVThunder 6-0. SOG 22-8 MOB. #AJHL #ymm

1114 2018-10-08 21:49:03 Oil inporting countries like AUS and New Zealand are complaining on the surging oil price and blaming Trump’s sanctions on Iran, major oil exporter, and strong USD for the rise. In PH, we just blame Duterte and TRAIN law even if our peso is weak & we import all our oil.

1115 2018-10-08 21:49:00 my room just stinks of oil paint and regret ugh
1116 2018-10-08 21:49:00 this particular article is also basically a guessing game...  look...kushner is a fucktard that i care nothing about.he didnt need anything special to forge a relationship with the saudis. they need us to by their oil and we need them to buy weapons and let us use airspace.
1117 2018-10-08 21:48:56 Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1120 2018-10-08 21:48:31 Cement production requires high heat, so coal or gas should be reserved for that or a new way found to make concrete. Many medicines and industrial processes require oil fractions. We shouldn’t be burning fossil fuels for uses that are trivially exchanged for a better alternative
1121 2018-10-08 21:48:23 War, Oil and Greed have caused Climate change #newsnight
1122 2018-10-08 21:48:05 President Trump should cancel EO 13795 which, earlier this year,  gave Alaska a gift allowing oil drilling in ANWR. Take it back until Mulkowski steps down... #ResignLisaResign
1123 2018-10-08 21:48:05 Electric vehicles don't stop climate change. They do reduce our dependency on oil, but at great expense which will force poor people off the roads and limit cars to the middle class #Newsnight
1124 2018-10-08 21:47:56 They can’t, it’s all about OIL.
1125 2018-10-08 21:47:52 OBJ/Atiku regime met PMS at ₦20 but left it at ₦75. This is over 200% increase at a time when the price of oil was good.

The regime sold all out national assets and yet left the country is a state of coma

1128 2018-10-08 21:47:38 As for trade, Nigeria had refused to sell oil to South Africa for decades in protest against the white minority rule. Nigeria had lost approximately $41 billion during that period.
 
South Africa owes Nigeria everything!

1134 2018-10-08 21:47:01 It's ok they'll have Scotland and we have the oil and gas, 30% of Europe's wind and wave power potential, whisky and most of the fishing waters!
1135 2018-10-08 21:46:54 Don’t disagree. I hope to be proven wrong. Even if we are wrong what’s the worst that happens? Big oil shifts to other energy sources sooner and we get cleaner air. Maybe gov gets richer off a carbon tax with little result. If you guys are wrong, we may need to leave the planet
1136 2018-10-08 21:46:53 In the span of a 10 hour work day, I have accidentally:
-caused a spewing gas leak in a car
-spilled 9.1 quarts of used oil on the floor
-punched myself in the jaw

Happy Monday!
1137 2018-10-08 21:46:52 'Political realism in Europe', #Newsnight? Why--other than war over oil, etc--do you think there are increased refugee flows into this subcontinent if not #climatechange destroying basis of agriculture in affected regions?
1138 2018-10-08 21:46:45 In the real world, oil & product flows move at tanker & refinery speed. Crude (unrefined) oil is a fraction of $ trade flows. Transaction price requires forward FX rate as settlement may take months. MMbtu & kWh denominated energy services (eg heat) set purchasing power parities
1139 2018-10-08 21:46:44 Lack of facts like the FACT that British Blockades of oil crippled Nazi war efforts? poor quality of the argument that historical context is important in analyzing leaders? Your use of insult tactics and bot-accusations shows YOUR lack of any real argument.
1140 2018-10-08 21:46:37 Isn't food great ? You would probably have to take a Fisetin supplement to get a truly therapeutic dose but maybe not. I personally notice a dramatic reduction in joint pain after only 1 lb of frozen wild salmon and about a heaping plateful of kale (+ Vitamin C, wheat germ oil).
1141 2018-10-08 21:46:24 A hot oven, heavy  baking sheet,  and lots of cornmeal. I also rub the dough with olive oil.

1143 2018-10-08 21:46:08 What I love about the free flowing #Kimmeridge oil is that no one knows exactly how much is going in the tanks.  You can’t count the pump rate, only the tankers. Steve has enough storage to hid about 11 tankers worth.  #UKOG #HorseHill #gusher
1144 2018-10-08 21:46:05 7. Take a look at the level of unprecedented polution in the area becuse of the rush for stolen oil and gas. AMALGAMATED by British govt and their jihadists 1914 to 2014 for stolen resources, Nigeria has expired. Research and understand climate change.
1145 2018-10-08 21:46:00 ridiculous. I have seen an olive tree 3,000 years + and tasted oil from it. In Puglia.

1147 2018-10-08 21:45:36 The body oil is in the advent calendar but you could save that after you have had the baby xx
1148 2018-10-08 21:45:32 Well i suppose i could agree with him to some extent if I’m in a place like San Francisco and Portland... they arent even like the country i was born into 33 years ago ..btw Robert Redford of course its not the country you were born into .. Alaska and Hawaii weren’t even states
1149 2018-10-08 21:45:14 I need an oil change
1150 2018-10-08 21:45:06 I actually use peppermint oil a lot so it’s weird if that is what irritated my skin. But thank you for the recommendations! I’ve tried a face oil and icing it. I’m hoping the redness goes away soon I have things to do and I can’t go out like this 
1151 2018-10-08 21:44:59 It’s as creamy and smooth as coconut oil but without the oiliness
1152 2018-10-08 21:44:56 Democrats want Trump to fail so that America can succeed.

Trump is like an old rusty overheated engine with no oil 
1153 2018-10-08 21:44:53 Oh by the way oil companies, since my last fill up cost the princely sum of $168.83, you should probably fix your dumb pay-at-pump systems so they aren't limited to $150 per transaction.
1154 2018-10-08 21:44:42 If the storm stays on a more eastward course, will be a power outage and cooling demand suppression threat (bearish). However, if it tracks further west towards Al/Ms (unlikely), it could result in a larger number of oil/nat gas rigs and transiently suppress production.
1155 2018-10-08 21:44:41 Fun memory fact. Condoleezza Rice was the one that had that huge Chevron oil tanker named after her to remind us all how much the Bush Admin and big oil loved their oil, so much so that they were willing to go to war and commit atrocities. 500000 plus died. No accountability.
1156 2018-10-08 21:44:33 Those same wind turbines that the Kennedy's wouldn't allow anywhere near their compounds no matter how much oil they used. Hmm, let's see Gore has a 25,000ft mansion, Flies all over along with DeCaprio, etc. who use large amounts of oil/gas but hey they are environmentalists.
1157 2018-10-08 21:44:28 Turn into luxury condos my man.
1158 2018-10-08 21:44:27 Shusssssss!    

Thou thankfully Fred is keeping an eye over night but I don't think he really understands the whole EV thing as he thinks electricity will leak out like oil from an old Fiat
1159 2018-10-08 21:44:24 Yep, selected few like:
1. Rice Mill workers
2. Railway workers
3. N-Power beneficiaries
4. Booming Agric workers
5. Expanding Oil & Gas workers
6. Power sector workers
7. Car assembly plant workers
8. School Feeding workers
9. Pensioners
10. Booming airlines workers.

#JustFew
1160 2018-10-08 21:44:18 none of this changes the fact that nazi germany was desperate for grain, oil, and rubber, which the USSR gladly provided for them
1161 2018-10-08 21:44:15 So, you want to kill thousands of US jobs, keep us dependent upon Middle East countries for oil/gas.....  all because some climate change huckster like Al Gore told us polar icecaps we’re gonna melt.
1162 2018-10-08 21:44:11 Furthermore, the sanctions against Iran only fuel the tensions with Iran, raising oil prices, which in turn aids Putin bringing the horrible Russian GDP up, and gaining power.
Lastly, Was it necessary to put gas in the fire in Jerusalem recognising Jerusalem as capital?
1163 2018-10-08 21:44:05 Is there any place happier than being pool side, smothered in tanning oil with a bev? Nope

1165 2018-10-08 21:43:53 Day 275
“Calling the Twelve to him, Jesus began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits.
They went out and preached that people should repent. They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.”
(Mark 6:7-13)
1166 2018-10-08 21:43:50 oil change OR you are low on oil which is bad!! go get some oil!
1167 2018-10-08 21:43:47 That looks like what the side of my old Saab looked like before i fixed most of the oil leaks
1168 2018-10-08 21:43:44 Acting hella surprised when you ask them about checking their fluids like BITCH!!! Change your damn motor oil! Lmaoo
1169 2018-10-08 21:43:38 The Witcher:
It was a snowy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about big Boars. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
1170 2018-10-08 21:43:32 It disgusts me. I understand that it can be hard to balance between business and environment, but avoiding the bone head stuff should be easy and non partisan. Pioneering green energy gets us away from dependence on the Middle East for oil and China for nuclear fuel.
1171 2018-10-08 21:43:24 @BBCNewsnight why do you get a climate change oil industry lobbyist on? He just talks rot. Embarrassing, but then so is his boss.
1172 2018-10-08 21:43:24 My mom is pressing me cuz I had no oil like I know about that 
1173 2018-10-08 21:43:18 Securing the oil resources before the War begins...The Russian economy is screwed and its people are tired of Putin he’s a very dangerous man. Oil prices set to Rocket.
1174 2018-10-08 21:43:06 Oil low so that means get an oil change soon or put in some oil. When was your last oil change?
1175 2018-10-08 21:42:57 Lip stick and lip gloss
- if your applying lipstick or lipgloss go for a moisturising one with olive oil in butter or a spf one!
1176 2018-10-08 21:42:48 Mr. President, we were told this week at we are the holder of the most Crude oil in the world. Why isn't it being process for gasoline. 
Gas prices are up and down by little everyday. You can do something. You promised to get the price down.
1177 2018-10-08 21:42:43 My mum tried using coconut oil in all her food on some healthy stuff, i was on strike for a bit
1178 2018-10-08 21:42:36 chicken and veggie pasta! no sauces except lemon, tomato’s, and a lil bit of olive oil for the veggie pasta!
1179 2018-10-08 21:42:26 Bailout funds to states after oil boom, completing over 16 years abandoned projects, not letting us be another Venezuela,
1180 2018-10-08 21:42:25 The one that produces the oil
1181 2018-10-08 21:42:18 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1182 2018-10-08 21:42:18 Perfectionist *
1183 2018-10-08 21:42:11 I know exactly how insurance works.

Insurance voluntarily pools the risk of unexpected losses among multiple individuals.

Health insurance shouldn't cover routine and expected things for the same reason auto insurance doesn't cover oil changes.
1184 2018-10-08 21:42:08 I hate the entire channel, im a perfection u see.
1185 2018-10-08 21:41:58 Always change your oil on time
1186 2018-10-08 21:41:48 Afghanistan has oil?
1187 2018-10-08 21:41:46 Oh and it’s your fault for driving to work, using plastic straws and bags, leaving the light on when you go out - nothing to do with big industry or the oil cartels or even the military industrial complex...
1188 2018-10-08 21:41:31 Use lip balm !
- throughout the day keep applying a oil or butter based lip balm to your lip to keep them moisturised.
- get a spf lip balm (atleast 15 spf)
1189 2018-10-08 21:41:30 A loves you that sounds like motor oil and have think it; worked in to enjoy your linking direct images of Ya!
1190 2018-10-08 21:41:25 Civilization itself is in danger, and none of our politicians are taking it seriously because they can't afford to anger oil & coal barons. This is insanity, and we'll all pay the price.
1191 2018-10-08 21:41:23 Ensco-Rowan deal makes sense but higher oil prices won’t soon help rig rates
1192 2018-10-08 21:41:09 You need to weep for Bayelsa with a population of about 2m people alone with number two position of the oil federal allocation
1193 2018-10-08 21:41:03 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1194 2018-10-08 21:41:03 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1195 2018-10-08 21:40:58 Idk I saw it and just went. "Oh...okay I guess cinder isn't dead. Alright."
1196 2018-10-08 21:40:54 It’s funny how most of the global emissions come from oil and coal companies but vegans wanna blame individual people for eating animal products

1207 2018-10-08 21:39:57 Norway has half the oil in the North Sea.
1208 2018-10-08 21:39:52 Oil is 80$/ barrel now so its not far less. Obasanjo used far less
1209 2018-10-08 21:39:38 Are you coming back? I can't bliv u died
1210 2018-10-08 21:39:28 Perfectly put, IMHO. It was exactly what I was thinking. I think politics does play a part. And a lack of faculties that facilitate comprehension. Oil made America great, so how can it be bad. Thus, if you want to take our oil, you must be a commie.
1211 2018-10-08 21:39:25 Oil dropped amid of U.S could ease restrictions on #Iran  crude sales, the global benchmark fell 0.3% to $83.91 @nymex
1212 2018-10-08 21:39:03 Our major catastrophe out east, where an oil refinery blew up, didn't kill or hurt anyone badly. Truly wonderful news on this Canadian Thanksgiving Day.
1213 2018-10-08 21:38:59 This happens to a few and most cases its because your skin is sensitive to the peppermint oil used in it. If you have a calming facial oil or toner/mist I would recommend applying and then wiping it off and reapply to soothe the burning sensation. Hope this helps
1214 2018-10-08 21:38:55 Yes after killing many innocent women and children, just for oil   and drive us into a depression for a big big Lie!
1215 2018-10-08 21:38:54 Rafael, I have been waiting for you to bring oil into your campaign? Even though it is completely out of context, very much like your bar b que lie.  I think you enjoy scaring people, but not this time...just saying

1220 2018-10-08 21:38:40 Women love to wash face, rub it with oil and stand right in the sun. Like directly as it's beaming into the house, talking bout "clear skin" "drinking my water and minding my business"

If you don't carry yourself back inside with your lapa lapa. Oniranu 
1221 2018-10-08 21:38:38 Went to get my oil changed. The attendant asked me if I wanted 5w30 or Pumpkin Spice. Things are getting out of hand!

1223 2018-10-08 21:38:13 Simple specific understandable instructions please, for example: 1. Stop burning fossil fuels (i.e. gas, oil, petrol, diesel, coal, turf) and 2. Stop eating meat (beef, lamb, mutton, pork, chicken, duck, fish). Thank you. #ClimateAction #SDG13 #GlobalGoals @IPCC_CH #GlobalWarming

1227 2018-10-08 21:37:42 People needs to wake up....stop working....no matter where you live, global warming coming into your door steps...100 mil(11 mil by Saudis) barrels of dirty oil gets burn into atmosphere DAILY/each 24 hours...we all be dead by 2045...Arctic will be Ocean by than...that's trouble
1228 2018-10-08 21:37:34 I wouldn’t be surprised if it is, seems plausible they might be talking about knock on effects due to the actions of those companies? Like BP and the emissions from that oil due to their mining
1229 2018-10-08 21:37:30 Back to the oil fields 
1230 2018-10-08 21:37:29 I just looked at myself in the mirror and found a large smudge of car grease on my eye socket, all smudged across the space between my nose and my eye, and covering the skin under my eye. I must have gotten it there checking the oil while gassing up my truck. Which means for…

1233 2018-10-08 21:37:14 @TheJuanWilliams
Two things we can expect battle ones with:
-Union organization
-Oil prices

Both need to be visited robustly.

1234 2018-10-08 21:37:06 And you reject huge data and science accepted by Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and virtually every oil major.

1236 2018-10-08 21:36:49 my CBD oil smells really weird :-( I don't like weird smelling skincare :-( strange smells in my face :-(
1237 2018-10-08 21:36:49 Well, today, I started my journey as an oil & gas defense attorney and I did it wearing a Saints polo & jeans.  #WhoDat
1238 2018-10-08 21:36:46 so if the heatsinks are such a helpful part of the board, how come most of them are 80% plastic?
snake oil.
1239 2018-10-08 21:36:41 Dont get what you kids dislike about him. He's Hispanic, his opponent adopted a Mexican name to appeal to latino voters. Cruz stopped the US from freeing a Mexican who had murdered 2 teen girls in Houston because the UN said so. Veto tried to tax Texas oil $10/barrel..

1241 2018-10-08 21:36:35 Yeah thing is it is that simple, was it just a coincidence that Nixon immediately made an exclusive deal with OPEC after switching off the gold standard? If not a need for oil, why would other countries trade us real goods and services for paper we print for free?
1242 2018-10-08 21:36:31 An illuminating facial mask, pastel black, with hematite, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating ruby dust. It comes in a beautiful jar.
1243 2018-10-08 21:35:51 Walkerton was negligence by the town foreman, Maple Leaf didnt clean their equipment the way they should, and Lac Megantic wouldnt be in the oil shipping business if there was enough pipelines. At the end of the day someone has to pay. Above were enforcement issues, not regs.
1244 2018-10-08 21:35:47 ok I got an oil stain on my jacket then a minute later opened twitter and got a tide ad and I'M SITTING SILENTLY BY MYSELF ATM so in conclusion tf
1245 2018-10-08 21:35:43 Would olive oil make the ass firm & big as it does to the breasts?
1246 2018-10-08 21:35:33 Like Norway, a major exporter of oil and gas.
1247 2018-10-08 21:35:28 It'll require at least 5 avocados and olive oil.
1248 2018-10-08 21:35:19 Actually I now add suya pepper. 'Spoils' your oil but makes a world of difference
1249 2018-10-08 21:35:12 Feeling stuck? Try making some art using oil pastels - consider the concept of fears in a geometric style.
1250 2018-10-08 21:35:08 How TF we go thru 6 pans of chicken, big ass storage container full of oil and three pans of spaghetti in one night....I swear we had to have fed the whole damn campus for homecoming
1251 2018-10-08 21:35:04 Did you fall in anointing oil?
1252 2018-10-08 21:34:51 Never eat margarine...goes through more processes than crude oil.
1253 2018-10-08 21:34:50 When there was that big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, 2010-2011, they flashed the map daily; Cuba never blocked entrance to the Gulf like it does now.
1254 2018-10-08 21:34:39 Kelewele that the groundnut is not fried with cooking oil is that one too Kelewele.
1255 2018-10-08 21:34:24 Why do the oil companies have to pay for roads?
1256 2018-10-08 21:34:23 Thome spirit of Figures needs to be appeased otherwise it will show up on everything price tag, fuel queue not forgetting basic commodity queues....... 2.6m for cooking oil, 2.6m vehicles queing up for fuel, 2.6+m people queing for basic commodities...

1259 2018-10-08 21:33:56 THANK YOU! do you mix the paint w linseed oil? or is there a cheaper alternative lmao
1260 2018-10-08 21:33:48 co-worker: Sounds like you need an oil change. (obviously concerned)
Me: Nah she's fine, I used to be a mechanic. (just adds oil to make the rumbling stop) She'll be just fine.
1261 2018-10-08 21:33:42 Can’t cross my legs these hoes keep sliding cause all the coconut oil 
1262 2018-10-08 21:33:33 Palm oil is 100% fat:: not meant to be consumed in copious quantities.  Dairy is a nutritional cornucopia.
1263 2018-10-08 21:33:26 Oil. Duh.
1264 2018-10-08 21:33:20 Anything for a vote (his new campaign slogan) ANYTHING... (you’ll pay for it all later bitches... plan for higher oil taxes!
1265 2018-10-08 21:33:09 no scorched engine oil about?

1268 2018-10-08 21:32:46 Scott Morrison is a 3rd rate, failed advertising executive who couldn't make a living ,in Australia, as an evangelical preacher or snake oil salesman so he became an LNP politician instead. #auspol
1269 2018-10-08 21:32:35 Since last Wednesday olive oil drops had them done couple of times before right ear doesn’t feel right hoping this will sort it people say once you get them done once got to get them done regular
1270 2018-10-08 21:32:35 Bondage,
We will never be able to take enough back if oil hadn't been discovered after our independence they would have taken it too, Africa's poverty today is because some people took by force the resources we had, and doomed a generation to poverty, pls leave internet fraudstar
1271 2018-10-08 21:32:31 The corruption favored the Shah and his cronies.  They were the ones that mismanaged the money.  The Shah had approved the PM, who started nationalizing the oil infrastructure. BTW the British had more investment than the US.  The Shah was always the power, & just took it back.
1272 2018-10-08 21:32:29 Home Design: Ladies\women home depot has a center ( you know what that means). Don't use them when looking 4 window pain treatments or studs, they aren't straight 2 give you that stunning finished look. Come 2 us @mcr_oil 4 all natural drizzle. They use glaze we have nuts.
1273 2018-10-08 21:32:27 1. Canada is destroying its Boreal forest via logging and oil sand oil extraction. This is not in your maths. 2. Canada has much of the world’s Tundra which, as it thaws, releases much methane a worse greenhouse gas than CO2. Again not in your maths.
1274 2018-10-08 21:32:22 [She leads them over to a huge guy with a beer gut and thinning hair gleaming with oil. He's wearing a load of heavy gold jewellery and has a cigar in his mouth. He greets her with a smirk and a suggestive tone, which she ignores and gets straight to the point - >>
1275 2018-10-08 21:32:20 "At that point in time, oil companies were looking to leave New Zealand and that would have been frightening for our actual infrastructure."

Only a NZ businessdude could consider walking away from selling a product almost every citizen has no option but to rely on.
1276 2018-10-08 21:32:01 Lol nah, it's cannabinoid oil (minus the THC)
1277 2018-10-08 21:31:49 It's the dirtiest oil to produce on one end of the pipeline and it has to go into tankers threatening our coast on the other.
1278 2018-10-08 21:31:46 then think how the pentagon and USD is structurally tied to oil. you might say that the "fiat" currency is backed by crude oil and weapons.

now think that 18% of emissions come from animal farming

this is how much work we have to do
1279 2018-10-08 21:31:29 Worth noting that Sainsbury's now stock Palestinian olive oil in some of their stores.
If anyone else knows of any other Palestinian produce available in the UK, please let us know.

1285 2018-10-08 21:31:01 If you do it yourself, cut the pumpkin into slices, remove seeds and cover with oil, cover tray with foil and roast in oven and then scrap flesh off...the pumpkin flavour is so much more intense this way and much less faff than boiling/steaming and pureeing xx

1298 2018-10-08 21:29:35 If "his neighbors" have an issue they don't need his grumpy ass to bitch for them. The real people to bitch about for this is the Conservative Party that pissed away billions of dollars in oil revenue instead of building infrastructure when it would've been much less intrusive.

1303 2018-10-08 21:29:10 Left my phone on top of my car after I got an oil change & lost it somewhere on the freeway. Can't afford to replace it because my wallet was there too. Gonna go try to find them! Wish me luck lmao
1304 2018-10-08 21:29:08 Why don’t you just move to the EU where the unelected elites will welcome you with both hands. You can join the currency as well, just like the Greeks did, good luck with that! at least you can fall back on North Sea oil...wait a minute...
1305 2018-10-08 21:29:01 Basically, I buy organic canned black beans, add tomatoes, celery, purslane in season, Indian spinach in season, onion tops, and chili peppers from my garden, and cayenne pepper, cumin, lime, olive oil, sea salt, and hot paprika. Then if it's too runny I use hummus mix to thicken
1306 2018-10-08 21:28:55 I sincerely need to YouTube how to change my own oil and rotate my damn tires

1309 2018-10-08 21:28:29 También con mi viejo, me compré una camisa Motor Oil y jugamos al Pool y alguna cerveza... se me fue todo el sueldo. Pero qué sensación hermosa de “todo lo puedo”
1310 2018-10-08 21:28:20 Simpler specific understandable instructions please, for example: 1. Stop burning fossil fuels (i.e. gas, oil, petrol, diesel, coal, turf) and 2. Stop eating meat (beef, lamb, mutton, pork, chicken, duck, fish). Thank you. #ClimateAction #SDG13 #GlobalGoals #GlobalWarming
1311 2018-10-08 21:28:18 When you're indoctrinated from birth to "buy" that which is nonsensical, you're primed to buy anything. Snake oil salesmen thrive on this type of human being.
1312 2018-10-08 21:28:05 Breadfruit 'oil down' is thing to give your dog 
1313 2018-10-08 21:28:03 I've heard CBD oil works really well! Just be wary of the oil that you get. Its not technically legal nationally so CBD oil isnt regulated by the FDA and can have additives that aren't good for dogs, some even not good for humans
1314 2018-10-08 21:27:57 Give em' the hot oil.
1315 2018-10-08 21:27:57 Is it apart of the service team at dealerships to try and add on different services to your car OUTSIDE of what you put on your appointment?! 

If I’m coming for an oil change then no I don’t want to get my tires rotated. I got them rotated during the last oil change. 
1316 2018-10-08 21:27:38 So. Oil prices rising and the NZ dollar dropping has no effect on petrol pricing. . .

I didn't know that.

I must call my old economics 101 lecturer and tell him he is mistaken. . .
1317 2018-10-08 21:27:21 I’m sick and so I suddenly can’t live without an oil diffuser.
1318 2018-10-08 21:27:20 Part of that problem is the U.S. petrodollar status as the oil trading currency of the world. That petrodollar status props up more than just a bit of the value of the nation's currency in a deal worked w/OPEC nations during Nixon's admin.
1319 2018-10-08 21:27:16 So who can help me with this oil change lol
1320 2018-10-08 21:27:08 Oh, thank you. Is there a link to yours? I really wanted to see it but had a noon class at that time. But the OTHER class I was teaching that semester was on the culture of oil! I'm teaching it again next semester as an MA course and would love to work your talk into it.
1321 2018-10-08 21:27:08 In 2016, when President Barack Obama floated the idea of a $10 a barrel tax on oil, paid by energy companies, to fund infrastructure investment.o’ Rourke wanted to target those dollars toward mass transit, high-speed rail and other "clean transportation."The idea went nowhere.
1322 2018-10-08 21:26:56 Because of the oil they have
1323 2018-10-08 21:26:55 Oh okay. Then you pay the extra $10 on each barrel of oil we use. We'll just keep sending you that bill. You should be able to handle it. That way windmills will work for later.
1324 2018-10-08 21:26:45 That thought has crossed my mind as oil and the dollar have rallied together recently, I’m interested to hear your take on why it’s currently pegged? The increase in oil production/exports by the US?
1325 2018-10-08 21:26:41 What should I call them?
I just had a taste...

Grated potatoes 
Grated sharp cheddar
Lots of black pepper
Salt
Gently fried in olive oil until very crisp.

Oh, so good!
1326 2018-10-08 21:26:15 Simple specific understandable instructions please, for example: 1. Stop burning fossil fuels (i.e. gas, oil, petrol, diesel, coal, turf) and 2.

1330 2018-10-08 21:26:01 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1331 2018-10-08 21:25:58  Bones don't turn to oil
1332 2018-10-08 21:25:57 “Alright, along with an oil change, should we replace your air filter and coolant?”

“Um...I have no idea.”

“Well it’s your car so if you want to you can, but if you don’t want to you don’t have to.”

...idk how to handle this mechanic who doesn’t seem to want all my money.
1333 2018-10-08 21:25:38 because it's not a kettle but you aren't using a microwave or vegetable oil like some people
1334 2018-10-08 21:25:34 had oil made for like 2weeks now. I be lazy
1335 2018-10-08 21:25:21 Is that when we all die off and turn into oil?
1336 2018-10-08 21:25:20 Nope. The Saudis said they did their part to increase oil production in the wake of the Iranians being put on the sidelines. Not a coincidence this happened now. A deal was made and these idiots are not even subtle. Trump gets oil prices not skyrocketing and the Saudis get a life
1337 2018-10-08 21:25:07 we live in a world where oil is a non renewable resource. How dare the current government want to advance the public transport agenda in this county. Why are that not promoting more cars and therefore more demand for oil and extra pollution in our atmosphere. You’re a twit.
1338 2018-10-08 21:24:44 Please google the list of 7 countries the US planned to invade & overthrow Gvnts for oil, Isreal & $US. Iran is almost at the end of that list, trump is just another puppet for the Pentagon. This illegal invasion has been planned for years.
1339 2018-10-08 21:24:35 Illegal in Texas, unfortunately. Tried the CBD oil and I didn’t really notice any difference.
1340 2018-10-08 21:24:32 People are really rubbing castor oil on their hairlines. It’s gone lads 
1341 2018-10-08 21:24:24 See mumu analysis must you talk
1342 2018-10-08 21:24:20 And leaders with the names off fish want to give up all the Scottish fishing rights all because the lust after north see oil.
1343 2018-10-08 21:24:13  u really are not smiling
1344 2018-10-08 21:24:10 Because #Supreme leaders are still forcing us to use oil and other #primitive #fossilFuels when we have many green alternative solutions including #solar and other #freeEnergy options but it doesn’t support the #Rockefeller’s #endeavors ruling over the #globe with other #bankers
1345 2018-10-08 21:24:02 That’s unfortunate Bob.  But, you do have the option to move to some muslim hell hole like say....Paris.
1346 2018-10-08 21:24:00 .@absentmxnd and @trxthuntold are ill and our room smells so strongly of olbas oil & TCP. My lungs have never worked so well.
1347 2018-10-08 21:23:50 these fuckers really cracked my oil pan but they’re fixing it for free so im not THAT mad but now i cant drive it tomorrow sigh
1348 2018-10-08 21:23:48 Not unfortunate at all Paul given how he obtained his fortune. He started a trend that has distorted the game which was followed by the oil riches of the Middle East. Unfortunately can't put the genie back in the bottle.
1349 2018-10-08 21:23:42 It was easier for Buharist to fly the flag of Anti corruption, Disciplinarian, Intergrity ,competence, accountability, openness, fairness,Statemanness,Oil and Gas expert, Security expert  ,Boko Haram antidote,Religious indifference & many  qualities PR experts used  in 2015
1350 2018-10-08 21:23:41 That’s the plan lol but being that oil paint is expensive I want to go into it with a plan ya know
1351 2018-10-08 21:23:36 Stability is relative, in a post petrodollar world there will be no global reserve currency, it will be a 24/7 competing market, I know that's hard to wrap your head around  The petrodollar is only stable becuase we destroy any country that sells their oil in anything but
1352 2018-10-08 21:23:29 I have not heard a single scientist or liberal ever claim that this is a mechanism for restricting personal freedom. What a stupid argument from someone in the pockets of big oil. #VoteRohrbacherOut

1355 2018-10-08 21:23:23 The crowds at your snake oil rallies are hired actors. What is your point?
1356 2018-10-08 21:23:21 Many supermarkets sell peanut butter containing palm oil. Today I made my own peanut butter using olive oil. Delicious it is too. #DropDirtyPalmOil
1357 2018-10-08 21:23:19 Naked but healthy! I accidentally discovered that Tarte’s maracuja oil works WONDERS as a cuticle oil and nail treatment.
1358 2018-10-08 21:23:10 Why isn’t it electric?  Aren’t you using a gas/oil from a pipeline?  Tisk tisk.
1359 2018-10-08 21:23:06 Oh please. Palm oil is typically horrible. But that in no way means that current levels of meat and dairy is sustainable. Look up the impact of cattle feed production.

1362 2018-10-08 21:22:52 Favorite uses for tea tree oil??
1363 2018-10-08 21:22:49 IIRC per Mike Mornard, that was pretty common in the early days. E.g. "my guy lights the oil with his torch."
1364 2018-10-08 21:22:47 I didn't see her post but let me ask people this. 
The big oil don't want this. 
They didn't want diesel hemp oil so poof it's outlawed. 
 did you see the drama in the USSC? 
That's a power play. 
Think they won't trash him? 
it's best to re-evaluate the issue w/ fresh lenses!
1365 2018-10-08 21:22:43 -coconut oil masks once a week
-shampoo then condition, brush your hair out with a wide tooth comb and then put in a hair mask that's meant to be rinsed out
-brush again and part it after u shower and BOY THE MOST IMPORTANT!!! leave in conditioner! (mixed chicks is my fav brand)
1366 2018-10-08 21:22:38 I think we all know what happens in SA. They control OIL! so "they are theocratic fascists but they are OUR theocratic fascists" USA, USA, USA...  #ResistAllofThem!
1367 2018-10-08 21:22:36 My potna need a oil change quick....only mf who could do it was a nigga from Sylvester ,Ga.
1368 2018-10-08 21:22:32 Foamies beard oil and balm has been my favorite so far.
1369 2018-10-08 21:22:31 Dr appointment, oil change, grocery shopping and now a birthday party I’m freaking exhausted to say the leasttttttt
1370 2018-10-08 21:22:25 solar cell was taped on cardboard for a decade, and the small charge differential it generated from ambient light sucked oil(?) off the cardboard on the cathode side, in patterns which showed an image of the internal structure of the cardboard, and was blank on the tape
1371 2018-10-08 21:22:22 Also, that's pretty damn prejudice toward people that do that type of work. I'm sure you dont change your own oil. These guys aren't "grease monkies." They attend numerous hours of class annually and get paid pretty well nowdays.
1372 2018-10-08 21:22:11 So when #AlGore told us in 05 told us  the Arctic Ice would be gone by now, glaciers gone, Maldives gone and this did not happen why should we be conned by this latest round of ‘Club of Rome’ inspired fear? Remember peak oil, silver all lies. #ClimateGate

1375 2018-10-08 21:22:01 You provided a link to a forum which were far from impressive. And no, there is more money in oil. Scientists are not rich.
1376 2018-10-08 21:22:01 The next morning Jacob got up very early. He took the stone he had rested his head against, and he set it upright as a memorial pillar. Then he poured olive oil over it. Genesis 28:18
1377 2018-10-08 21:22:00 I like the NYX Eye & Lip Makeup Remover and Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser. I sometimes just use olive oil or baby oil and that works really well too.
1378 2018-10-08 21:21:50 Scandinavian economic models are not suitable for many countries - high amounts of natural resource (Norway produces ~£30k capital per household per year via oil resources) low populations, much lower immigration then countries like the U.K., France, Ger etc.
1379 2018-10-08 21:21:34 just like @greenpeaceusa not protesting for the last oil spill in Cuba.
1380 2018-10-08 21:21:27 HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!?

Also if you add a little bit more oil for the Schnitzel so it kinda swims in the boiling oil it becomes more golden/brown and the chance to burn the breading is less :D
1381 2018-10-08 21:21:26 Yes because gas and oil and 2 failures are all that matters....#HappyThanksgiving
1382 2018-10-08 21:21:23 The Koch brothers, along with every other oil baron, should be tried in Nuremburg.

1386 2018-10-08 21:21:03 Yes, homeopathy is bullshit.
If you add salt to water, then add even more water, tell me, what are you doing?
You’re diluting the solution. You are making it weaker.

You people are essentially selling flavored water and posing it as a cure. Modern day snake oil.
1387 2018-10-08 21:20:47 Alberta sucked off the teat of Canada for a hundred years. Seriously you get shafted because of the previous UCP/PC parties lack of royalties. Norway has a trillion dollars and produce half as much oil.
1388 2018-10-08 21:20:46 Yes same here... Now I think I may have to become friends with olive oil and macademia nuts for a while man my LDL are though the roof. I am hoping Dave is right but we may have to wait a while... How are your LDL-C/P on carnivore?
1389 2018-10-08 21:20:31 i think you’ll burn you face  have you considered just using beard oil?

1391 2018-10-08 21:20:22 This news is an indicator showing oil reserves in Oman are low, once upon a time all the wells in PDO assets use to come up at 30 bar pressure, then came the water injection, then gas injection then steam injection (Mukhaizna-Oil fields) & soon there will be Zero OIl @simeonkerr
1392 2018-10-08 21:20:19 You: Doc I broke my leg.
UK Doc: meh rub oil on your arm.
1393 2018-10-08 21:19:56 we gonna need a lot of growth. an extra BILLION gallons won't last us 4 hours unless we cut back hella. From my understanding oil growth is very slow. Not gonna see much growth in 50 years. Even if we find twice as much as we thought, we're still looking at under 100 years.
1394 2018-10-08 21:19:55 IMHO this is all about the massive unconventional Musk approach and disruption to a century old ICE industry and Big Oil associated with it. Gotta be in it for the long fight to change it.

1396 2018-10-08 21:19:50 Have you tried CBD oil?
It helps me with my insomnia and it is used as an anti-inflammatory. I live in Texas and it was legalized here about a year ago. So it's probably legal just about everywhere.

1399 2018-10-08 21:19:41 Disturbing how much @BBCNews is heavily focusing on what individuals can do about #climatebreakdown instead of what governments MUST do involving decicions about tax & subsidies. They've been subsidising big oil forever. Bear that in mind. A new era should have happened years ago
1400 2018-10-08 21:19:37 Oho ..Nigerians dey measure ur intelligence by d way u speak which is totally wrong
1401 2018-10-08 21:19:29 Fun Fact about #ChristopherColumbus: He sent the very first dick pic in 1493 when he forced a Native American man to create an oil painting of his flaccid member and mail it home to Italy. #TheMoreYouKnow
1402 2018-10-08 21:19:25 Less than 4% of Canada's population works either directly or indirectly in our energy sector, that includes wind, solar, oil, gas, and hydro-electric.

I'll be a proud #Canadian supporting ALL our working men and women, not just oilsands workers.
1403 2018-10-08 21:19:22 was at  college . Lunch and supper if available ws boiled, no oil , no salt cabbage. U added yr own salt...course salt only ws available...before use you had to grind it first. It ws hectic
1404 2018-10-08 21:19:21 I tell you what, @poochandmutt salmon oil has given The Dowager (17yrs old) a new lease of life
1405 2018-10-08 21:19:10 Clawing the doors of SCOTUS like an insane person, attacking elderly, climbing on statues defiling them, aggressively chasing congressional members, sending threatening messages to them, and harassing people eating dinner.  Yea Chuck, that's mob behavior.
1406 2018-10-08 21:19:09 I used to use Take The Day Off but it wasn't getting all my eye makeup off, I'd have to follow it with a couple swipes of micellar water. Switched to Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil and it's working so much better.
1407 2018-10-08 21:19:05 I love how all my co workers and I have oil pens  everyone just toasted watching Queen videos right now
1408 2018-10-08 21:19:01 WA state has initiative 1631. Want to go after transportation trucks, cars and oil Companies with fees.  No cap on fees. Or how money spent. Exempt many other companys that pollute. Told to complicated for me. I got out of it drivers be charged $10 a month. Treat Companies equal
1409 2018-10-08 21:19:00 Didn’t the tax take effect last year? So the high prices this year are due to the cost of a barrel of oil on the world markets aren’t they?
1410 2018-10-08 21:18:58 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
1411 2018-10-08 21:18:41 Winter must be nearly here in IoM: first day that the girls had the plug-in oil heaters running at full blast on the office - I was sweating cobs just wearing a T-shirt. The staff are remarkably binary - by rule, the heaters must only ever be full on or full off.
1412 2018-10-08 21:18:40 Lol imagine using conventional oil and having to go every 3k miles couldn’t be me
1413 2018-10-08 21:18:32 There is a difference in receiving subsidies and only being relevant because of subsidies. So with a straight face that oil and gas does not turn profits.
1414 2018-10-08 21:18:25 It's the opposite. Collapse oil & there goes the oil peg & energy/resource security. Oil is not priced in $, €, £ or even gold; they are all priced in oil
1415 2018-10-08 21:18:21 Big business oil is all about this...I am sure they will do their part and this will be easily achieved.  
1416 2018-10-08 21:18:20 The economic warfare aka "sanctions" and what effect it's having on the globe. Lines are being drawn in the sand everywhere..pin everyone against everyone. Gets back to oil...AGAIN
1417 2018-10-08 21:18:12 Fashion is the 2nd biggest polluter of the Planet after oil.  I genuinely had no idea. Thank you @StaceyDooley for opening my eyes.
1418 2018-10-08 21:18:10 Have you seen anything that the city have done on time and on budget. In 1988 the games were done by business people. No oil company support financially or volunteers like 88. Will do nothing for city except force taxpayers into bankruptcy
1419 2018-10-08 21:18:08 How would Separation work?  It’s still not going to allow your oil off the shores of B.C.  Also there is a big difference between Tar sands and natural gas when it comes to a spill. Do some research.
1420 2018-10-08 21:17:57 "Yes, I will get a lot of work done while waiting for my oil change at the car place."

"Hello, yes, I have done nothing but make a playlist for my D&D character and start making a prop for an audio-only campaign. What's wrong with me?"
1421 2018-10-08 21:17:50 I remember back around 1970, experts predicted we would be completely out of oil by 2000.
1422 2018-10-08 21:17:47 The truth is in comparison with the vast expanse of arable land available for cocoa farming and our population, we are far behind in production and export of cocoa. We use to be world no 1 exporter before discovery of commercially viable quantities of oil.
1423 2018-10-08 21:17:44 And then I had to sit there for the remainder of my oil change in complete shame 
1424 2018-10-08 21:17:40 Is this article an example of repeating a lie often enough that it becomes true?

Alberta's tarsands oil is the cleanest in the world?
It's so difficult to extract it wasn't even worth mining for over several decades when easier patches were available.
1425 2018-10-08 21:17:36 I was told once your on blood pressure meds it’s 4life NOT I took myself for a year without my doctor knowing when I took my physical and confess all she said was keep doing what your doing !! That plus a committed work out !! Anything possible so I will add the oil to my life
1426 2018-10-08 21:17:36 The @AldiUSA commercial with the mom and her grown-ass man child riding in the cart talking about olive oil is mad creepy and borderline Oedipal. #hardpass
1427 2018-10-08 21:17:21 Does it come with complementary snake oil?
1428 2018-10-08 21:17:19 Bragging about oil companies supporting it is meaningless. They simply pass their costs on to the consumer
1429 2018-10-08 21:16:44 Amen.  Who even needs oil or natural gas anymore!?  I'll heat my house and self-transport with gigajoules of energy that will rain down on us from heaven!  Any day now, Will in Seattle.  Any fucking day.
1430 2018-10-08 21:16:44 UK government made around £3 million in revenues from oil last year, Norway made over 7bn less oil extracted, Shell oil paid £13bn in share dividends last year, they received a tax refund from the treasury. tory politicians voted through these tax breaks, pocketing dividends.
1431 2018-10-08 21:16:39 Essentially proved reserves grow over time. There is a ton of oil that is inaccessible and millions of gallons beyond what falls in the metric of proved reserves. I think the long term consequences on the environment from using oil at the current rate is apparent though.
1432 2018-10-08 21:16:38 My @FlyFrontier flight from Atl to SjC still hasn’t taken off. Now there is something wrong with the plane. Sitting on the tarmac waiting for a gate to open up. The plane smells like burning oil and BO.

1434 2018-10-08 21:16:10 Fact check. You support corporate welfare subsidies for oil companies.
1435 2018-10-08 21:16:08 Peak Oil hadisesini araştırırsanız dünyanın 2005 yılında Peak seviyesine ulaştığını görebilirsiniz. Bu seviyeye ABD 1973'te Suud 2005'te ulaşmış ve petrol üretimi terminal safhaya geçiş yapmıştır. Rusya ve Irak ise 3 yıl sonra bu hadiseyi yaşayacaktır.

1442 2018-10-08 21:15:22 @roxettearisa you once posted in a favorites video about this oil that you put a couple of drops into makeup products that have dried out in order to make them like new again. It would save me a ton of time if you could remind me what it was so I can scoop it up! Pretty please?
1443 2018-10-08 21:15:13 I'm not a one for perfumes but is there a particular essential oil you like and could reassure you and cheer you up? I love bergamot but I know a woman that wears basil and it helps her. Just trying to think how you can weave some of the hygge into your uaignead time...
1444 2018-10-08 21:15:08 Overturning CU comes later. But Dems don't need that to happen to stop taking PAC money. It would just be super effective to get on the debate stage and say "He/She is taking this much from Phara, this much from Wall Street, this much from Big Oil" *mike drop*. No counter!

1449 2018-10-08 21:14:31 the introduction of a cheaper, less destructive, more prevalent, and unbelievably safer fuel would absolutely check the oil industry, if not completely shut it out entirely.
1450 2018-10-08 21:14:28 @Lavorgnanomics @neelkashkari hey guys - there is INFLATION ...." “In the third quarter, we continued to experience significant raw material and elevating logistics cost inflation, including the effects from higher epoxy resin and increasing oil prices,” said M McGarry, PPG CEO

1452 2018-10-08 21:14:11 I was reading my doterra oil guide and it recommended Oregano oil for sinuses. Now my whole flat smells like margherita pizza
1453 2018-10-08 21:13:55 This from the man who made his fortune selling his network to Oil sheiks.
1454 2018-10-08 21:13:55 Remember those bulletproof earnings? Here's PPG with a huge guidance cut: “In the third quarter, we continued to experience significant raw material and elevating logistics cost inflation, including the effects from higher epoxy resin and increasing oil prices."
1455 2018-10-08 21:13:54 Often seems to be the result of watching 1 super woke video funded by oil companies. It's easier to read a facebook post than a published study.
1456 2018-10-08 21:13:54 looking for someone to buy me food and rub tea tree oil all over me
1457 2018-10-08 21:13:53 And then, even if people do see it as an issue, some people just don’t care, like me, I don’t care. If I cared I’d drive/want a Tesla rather then a V8 Mustang that gets 13 MPG and takes 6 quarts of oil and needs an oil change every 2500 miles. If I cared I wouldnt do fat burnouts
1458 2018-10-08 21:13:50 Lol, but dey say dat d govt is building roads, improving power, creating jobs & doing it under "low oil income"!
1459 2018-10-08 21:13:50 Brooo what the helllll is going on?!?!

Russia & the rest of BRICS are consistently trying to dismantle the Cabal.
They started another bank to rival the petrodollar system.
Russia & US military are confusing the shit out of me in the Middle East.
Rockefellars divesting from oil.

1464 2018-10-08 21:12:52 And also to @antonioguterres : the world needs simple specific instructions please, for example 1. Stop burning fossil fuels (i.e. gas, oil, petrol, diesel, coal, turf)and 2. Stop eating meat (beef, lamb, mutton, pork, chicken , duck, fish). Thank you. #SDG13 #ClimateAction

Whether it's oil, public transport, decongestion of roads, real estate mess, scams by fraudsters/ institutions, generating employment etc There r just 2 many holes every where
1466 2018-10-08 21:12:28 Wow taxing the oil producer. Is it a bad thing to take money from the oil companies that are taking all Texans oil?
1467 2018-10-08 21:12:23 Honestly, any makeup removing oil. So far the mac one is my favorite.

1470 2018-10-08 21:12:02 Oh dear not a royalist then? I'm not as up on the oil revenues as you but I thought
1471 2018-10-08 21:12:00 With some olive oil, garlic salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning and roasted in the oven, they're soooooo good! I hate them before, but I love them now.
1472 2018-10-08 21:11:26 The TimeBoys are baffled by oil rigs!
1473 2018-10-08 21:11:07 imagine my disappointment when I discover that not only does this extra virgin olive oil not come with an extra virgin, it doesn't even come with a starter virgin

1476 2018-10-08 21:10:51 @MittRomney wants to drill oil on federal land & further enrich himself.  Fans like his success and demeanor, but look where his allegiance lies.  His morals are compromised! We need leaders like @JennyWilsonUT who embrace new technology and protect people, our health and planet.

1480 2018-10-08 21:10:18 Forgive my ignorance, but what is CBD oil? Is it from cannabis?
1481 2018-10-08 21:10:15 I had mine painted early renaissance style.  Oil on canvas, of course.  It illuminates an entire room.
1482 2018-10-08 21:10:13 Weak link is that oil & $ have been rising together which in my analysis is because $ has been quietly pegged to oil #OilStandard since end Q1 2018. If I'm right then when, not if, China leads Buy-side revolt/strike, $ will follow oil down
1483 2018-10-08 21:10:12 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this October? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
1484 2018-10-08 21:10:06 Great, just what big oil needs yet another excuse to raise gas prices in the many regions of Canada NOT served by this refinery.

1486 2018-10-08 21:09:49 i went to walmart for an oil change n they said it would be about an hour, when i came back in a hour and they hadn’t even started so i took my keys and mf left,,, don’t know what i expected but i’m still disappointed,,, i did buy a cool plant tho
1487 2018-10-08 21:09:34 I made this point and my oil executive friend got offended
1488 2018-10-08 21:09:28 i...but... does "Canadian crude" not include the oil sands? oil sands oil is among the dirtiest in the world, because so much oil needs to be burned to run the extraction equipment. that's why the cost to produce is so high. am i not getting the joke?
1489 2018-10-08 21:09:26 He could hide German corpses inside of oil barrels
1490 2018-10-08 21:09:21 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

1493 2018-10-08 21:09:08 Houston has got to be in a good mood right now. Lot of Aggies and Longhorns there to celebrate big wins this weekend. Astros about to head to ALDS. Texans won. Price of oil is up. Honestly, they need as much help as they can get.

1496 2018-10-08 21:08:56 A lotta fools will be wasting a lotta money on those Snake Oil Salesmen.
1497 2018-10-08 21:08:55 One of the reasons I opened a preloved childrens designer clothing boutique fashion is second only to oil on the list of worst offenders 2,700 litres of water to make one t shirt ! We have no respect for our planet #FashionsDirtySecrets
1498 2018-10-08 21:08:55 What about the cotton industry feeding fast fashion industry producing clothes we do not need! We need to address this too as second polluter after oil!
1499 2018-10-08 21:08:54 Do you drive? If not, great! I live in a big city where the main opponents of pushing for more public transport, safer cycling and more housing near transit aren't oil companies but people who can't imagine living without their cars.
1500 2018-10-08 21:08:47 Did they use palm oil or soap?
1501 2018-10-08 21:08:46 Do you think us Scots don't pay taxes or have oil, whisky,salmon industries as well as a healthy travel and tourism along with wind farms producing energy and water that WE subsidise to England and ruk? We are subsidising you my dear,not the other way round. Honestly you people!
1502 2018-10-08 21:08:32 Even Bani?
1503 2018-10-08 21:08:22 I was feeling good/energized for a workout this evening but now as I wait for my oil change I feel drained/tired/discouraged.
1504 2018-10-08 21:08:12 Everything in me wants a new car. Y’all see my old ass 2009 Kia. 

But I don’t NEED a new car. I can afford the car note but I don’t NEED it. Oil changes and alignment , brake and some windshield fluid, and I’m SET. This baby gonna last me Atleast another year of not more
1505 2018-10-08 21:08:05 So it may be longer IF we find more oil that we haven't found yet?

1507 2018-10-08 21:08:01 He's only speaking up because the actual scientists are not being listened to. 

It's an issue that seems entirely political until you realize that banks, militaries, oil companies, etc are all all treating massive sea-level rise as an inevitability while the rest of us bicker
1508 2018-10-08 21:07:55 the real question is, why were you even asking? your question suggests that modern nuclear production is somehow inferior and less safe than wind and solar. this is simply not the case (tho the coal/oil industries want you to think that it is)
1509 2018-10-08 21:07:45 The white chunks you're seeing are hardened pieces of coconut oil that we included to mimic the fattier pieces you'd find in a meat sausage. However, these chunks shouldn't be larger than the size of a pea. We will send you a DM to gather more information.

Time for Europeans to embrace a Real Green Revolution.  
But they are hypocritical bastards at heart.
Carry on fight.

1516 2018-10-08 21:07:10 Inhaling far too much olbas oil in a bid to get over this cold. Feeling like some Stonehenge seeking tourists have just paid me a visit in Salisbury
1517 2018-10-08 21:07:10 개..... 개 말이죠.
1518 2018-10-08 21:06:53 Those estimates are based on proved reserves and not accurate in how many gallons of oil actually exist but we will likely reach the economic limits of oil extraction in the next few generations. At least that’s my understanding
1519 2018-10-08 21:06:53 @ProPublica Torrent oil, a start up company has taken the lease on family's oil well. Royalties have been slashed by 3/4 since take over. Information from Greg "owner" keeps saying well is fine and pumping 24/7.  Jerry Solis/ 2816287607 more info. Please call.

1522 2018-10-08 21:06:30 But but but oil money.
1523 2018-10-08 21:06:30 I think this is the result of major loop holes in policy making. By now we should have cut our reliance on oil and switched to CNG or electric vehicles. Our reaction is very late.
1524 2018-10-08 21:06:30 The Shell LNG terminal was just approved on very favourable low tax terms, so this might be a goodwill gesture in return. The company likely did not have to pay fees on the offshore oil since 1972, due to the moratorium
1525 2018-10-08 21:06:28 When you manage to do something like make a dentist appointment or get your oil changed, it feels like an enormous #adulting success.

Feel it might be needed.
1530 2018-10-08 21:05:24 I just realized I’d never be able to oil paint without completely relearning the skill. 100% of my painting practice has involved setting my brush hand on a flat surface, either the table or the canvas itself, meaning I need the paint to dry fast. Oh well. Good to know.

1558 2018-10-08 21:01:55 And it's not valid to compare the environmental impact of the oil, transport and fashion industries like they were separate. Cotton and other yarn has to be transported from source to the factories, then to the markets such as in the West. All that uses oil. #FashionsDirtySecrets
1559 2018-10-08 21:01:51 somehow I was thinking that the Irvine Oil refinery would be in Irvine in SoCal... shows what I know

1569 2018-10-08 21:00:53 Oil is not generally used to generate electricity. Coal is the bigger source.

1581 2018-10-08 20:59:38 I mean yeah but these are mostly just all the companies who make what we put in our cars. Lifestyles built around the car have to change. We can't just tweet "damn the oil companies!" while waiting for our Ubers.

1586 2018-10-08 20:58:57 And I ask when taxes are down or cut why is it never specified just what services have been cut, weakened or sold off?  I ask how can there be cuts when the healthcare system is being starved? How come there is always money for arms, pipelines and oil subsidies? #cdnpoli
1587 2018-10-08 20:58:55 International shipping using highly polluting output from heavy diesel oil contributes far more challenge to the environment than domestic cars.
1588 2018-10-08 20:58:38 Nice try.  With the oil crisis in the 70's there was a glut of money going into Iran. It was not well managed and a lot of corruption.  When oil prices dropped, there was less cash, & recession hit. The clerics pushed for riots & protests. The Shah was overthrown.
1589 2018-10-08 20:58:32 China is taking the oil in Libya while our embassy is being attacked after we won the war for the rebels. Trump's policies suck!

1598 2018-10-08 20:57:26 Nothings going to change while the rich's wealth assets are buried underground in the oil reserves!

1602 2018-10-08 20:57:10 Were not a tiny country, but the wealthiest country in the world is Norway, they have extracted less oil than us and now have a sovereign fund of £2 trillion pounds, the corrupt UK government have managed to extract around 25% more oil and amassed £1.8 trillion in debt
1603 2018-10-08 20:57:07 Weird, I keep looking for the right to abortion, healthcare,  living wage , free college, right to immigrate, right to not be offended, and the right to vote yourself my stuff.
@SenDuckworth copy must be different than mine.
1604 2018-10-08 20:56:49 Well, if you don't like oil getting taxed, then may I suggest promoting renewable energy?

1606 2018-10-08 20:56:47 You gonna sanction them? Oh nvm you guys are bff with Saudi Arabia. Yet u sanctioned Russia over evidence-free allegations because they dropped the petrodollar and u want to stop Russia from exporting oil to Europe. That was the real reason. #Criminals

1608 2018-10-08 20:56:35 Does cooking oil come from crude oil? Sounds like a propaganda damage control measure from some CIO office to me.
1609 2018-10-08 20:56:16 Just olive oil out my cupboard?
1610 2018-10-08 20:56:11 I was talking to my friends over the weekend about how there's only an estimated 50 years of oil reserves left on Earth. 

As a planet, we produce 3.8 BILLION gallons of oil per day. 

That shit is hella alarming. A lot of us might still be alive.
1611 2018-10-08 20:56:05 It was National who set these price hikes up with their big oil mates. Google it. Labour have just allowed what was going to happen and are now trying to fix this.

1619 2018-10-08 20:55:12 Don't forget the whaling industry too.  The #MAGA Cult  needs whale oil to light their lamps so they can read Republican propaganda.

1621 2018-10-08 20:54:38 OK, I'll bite: human rights, highly regulated, environmental proactiveness and Canadians are nice. There's 4 good supporting statements for our energy resources. Conflict Free Oil comes to mind as a good way to support clean Canadian oil industry. 

But hey, what do I know?
1622 2018-10-08 20:54:31 No immediate idea, I'm afraid. I'm guessing rove (& many other) beetles can potentially have several breeding cycles, depending on weather and other factors. So, as you've had a hot summer, they might have had another round for sure.. or even more. How about oil beetles, perhaps?

1629 2018-10-08 20:53:23 Which has its own pollution and radioactivity. If an oil refinery explodes, it can cost dozens of lives, and a few million in cost, but the rebuilding can begin right away. With nuclear, you get Chernobyl and Fukushima, which can kill *100s of thousands* and cost Billions.

1633 2018-10-08 20:52:28 This right here. Besides a gearbox oil change every 50k they need little work. Brakes last 100-200k due to regenerative braking. Taxi prius’ in the city get 200k from front brakes. Regular taxis? 30k.

1641 2018-10-08 20:51:40 Let's remember the Chally2 destroyed by a buried IED made from an oil drum.  No amount of passive protection can protect against all threats.  The lesson: passive protection is the lowest form of protection.  The highest is 'Don't be there [from our opponent's point of view].
1642 2018-10-08 20:51:30 The future is terrifying. But I'm trying my best to do what I can to reduce my carbon footprint, promote knowledge about climate change, be kind, and treat my body well so I can be as successful as possible in the oil wars of our enivtable hellscape. Fear me.

1652 2018-10-08 20:49:48 And the Koch Consortium. Trump family is like a cheap knockoff of the Koch Consortium, between their random acquisitions of paper products, to oil pipeline supply chain, donations to PBS to #1 conservative donor referenced in "Dark Money". Turtle M is owned by them & big pharma.
1653 2018-10-08 20:49:46 Pruitt damaged the department that he's been suing for decades.

1671 2018-10-08 20:47:56 I think the most powerful approach there is what @billmckibben is doing with @350 - divestment. Shale oil in the US is a money-losing operation, it depends on investors who think oil = money. Disabuse them of that notion, and we win.

1678 2018-10-08 20:47:08 The issue is not just the pipeline. It's what happens at the start and the end of it as well. Bitumen is the dirtiest oil in production at the Alberta end and it needs to go onto tankers at the BC end.

1687 2018-10-08 20:46:08 most individuals would see a rebate to offset the tax increase. That's not something the oil lobby and the conservatives like to talk about.

1702 2018-10-08 20:44:12 And gas prices are up, most likely due to speculation, but in CA also because we need to repair our roads, which is happening.

1710 2018-10-08 20:43:13 Yep, it’s where the future lies. The great oil producing nations will fight the move to renewables but today’s statement on climate change means that the types of energy we consume will radically alter in the years to come. It could be very good economic news for Wales

1731 2018-10-08 20:41:26 So DruggieCuz was "nice" and got me a vape pen...(why I'll never know...I have never vaped)...and some supposedly marijuana oil for it called Green Crack. Now look, I'll smoke the Devil's Lettuce with you, but nothing called Green Crack your ass bought off of eBay or the Dark Web
1732 2018-10-08 20:41:20 my skin used to b super oily too before i started using oils on my face which sounds counter intuitive but it actually balances out ur facial chemistry using ... science shit?? i swear by rosehip oil!!! but yeah!! most storebought shit just makes my skin super dry n gross too
1733 2018-10-08 20:41:04 alhamdulillah for older brothers bc you don’t know what car washes or oil changes are 
1734 2018-10-08 20:41:02 So I'd agree that there's a significant chance that we fail to "leave it in the ground" but there are some small steps in that direction: France and New Zealand ending oil & gas exploration; many countries banning fracking; Netherlands phasing out Groningen, UK blocking coal mine
1735 2018-10-08 20:40:54 I bet big oil has some interest in people adopting this idea that no matter what we do, we are powerless to prevent the next glaciation period. They average 80,000-90,000 years, by the way.
1736 2018-10-08 20:40:31 Kind of like oil and water huh TYLER!!
1737 2018-10-08 20:40:30 I want some cursed images. Can I have like, 20 or 30?

I'll say global warming is fake and oil companies are our friend if I have to.

1740 2018-10-08 20:40:05 Oh, it is a well-guarded secret due to their oil money and resulted Lobby power. They are expiring though. The sick cult pseudo-nation called #SaudiArabia soon will lose #CIA & Deep-State granted ‘sacred’ status. There will be #Saudi Pseudo Spring then: & the world will know then
1741 2018-10-08 20:39:47 It's just like cbd oil and stuff
1742 2018-10-08 20:39:40 Does anyone use MCT oil? 
1743 2018-10-08 20:39:36 I remember not having cooking oil in shops, having lots of money with no value, standing in ques for groceries, and on top of that all a government that stole votes
1744 2018-10-08 20:39:30 Aside from it being cringeworthy and disturbed, while legally void, (it sounds like that nexus cult), her name is Steel and she worths in Clayton (where Clark Oil & Gas HQ is). So obviously e james or whoever actually wrote it or their editor is an agent... and if so.... wtf!!!
1745 2018-10-08 20:39:27 Here in AMERICA we use mystery oil in all our cooking!! 

Slather some on your face then sleep under a heat-lamp for a healthy glow that will last for days.
1746 2018-10-08 20:39:26 Or over plucking, tweezing, waxing, threading. Doing any of this in excess with cause damage to the hair follicles. So using any type of oil or serum to grow out hair will take some time to see results
1747 2018-10-08 20:39:23 Don’t forget glitter specs and a hint of baby oil
1748 2018-10-08 20:39:21 What if I want slutty olive oil? Grocery stores are so judgmental. #stopslutshaming
1749 2018-10-08 20:39:16 Lunch today kind of erg: two avocados w sea salt and olive oil, a cup of peanuts, and a banana #vegan
1750 2018-10-08 20:39:09 Except people are wanting to move away from oil. Maybe you should open tech plants to make solar panels and the like instead? Better yet, how about you go away since you're nothing but a d-list hack.

1751 2018-10-08 20:39:05 The single biggest environmental disaster? Nuclear reactors , coal powered electric plants, islands in the ocean made entirely of garbage, poisoned rivers and streams, oil spills. All of these are small potatoes compared to a pig farm.
1752 2018-10-08 20:38:57 I really doh give a shit who doh like the smell of my eucalyptus oil tbh 
1753 2018-10-08 20:38:48 People are castigating you for that comment but at the end of the day, either we do it, or the planet and its climate does it. We have been arming mother nature with every barrel of oil burned and now the planet is going to go to war with us.
1754 2018-10-08 20:38:38 Words of a GRIFTER will always fall short. You're snake oil happy
1755 2018-10-08 20:38:37 Oh cool... I like coconut milk and coconut is good as a massage oil
1756 2018-10-08 20:38:23 Shell actually got into heavy oil in the late 70s with their plant at Three Creeks, near Peace River

1759 2018-10-08 20:38:08 The older the Silent Generation gets the more insufferable they become.  They love to reminisce about the way America was w/o accepting any responsibility for helping to create the America of today.
1760 2018-10-08 20:38:07 Thank you to all those who are helping reduce imported oil. Reducing emissions and saving themselves $$'s per week
1761 2018-10-08 20:37:54 @RachelNotley needs to heed this warning. Time to stop and further expansion of the oil sands and begin retraining workers in sustainable industries. Time to start the process of shutting down oil production.
1762 2018-10-08 20:37:45 No mix needed. Flour, pinch of salt, some sugar for sweetness, baking powder...milk & egg, oil perhaps or melted butter. Better than a bought mix & so simple to make.
1763 2018-10-08 20:37:42 I think it originated with one hurricane we had that actually hit an oil rig in the gulf so we experienced a gas shortage because of it, and ever since then any time there's a hurricane I guess people freak out and think they have to stock up? It's nuts.
1764 2018-10-08 20:37:28 Ladies, I kid you not castor oil will have your eyelashes grow so long without the need for extensions or falsies. I can attest to this growth because I’ve used it to grow out my eyebrows earlier this year
1765 2018-10-08 20:37:28 Your point? Cruz got his money from oil and gas BlackRock municipal bonds and a loan from Goldman Sachs. Beto got his from owning an assisted living facility and owning an apartment building. Do tell what am I missing?
1766 2018-10-08 20:37:25 Not sure about that.  I believe the Federalist Society supported Oil States and the abolition of AIA-trials, which they view as an overreach of the Administrative State against private property rights.  I recall they made a video about the case.

1771 2018-10-08 20:36:46 Myrna, you've always seemed like someone who would enjoy a Wesson oil party the most.
1772 2018-10-08 20:36:45 She literally falls to her knees to show just how hard it has hit her and that was pretty much how I, and I'm guessing many other fans, felt at that moment to. But in all honesty was anyone truly worried about Jonah during the Oil Refinery Mission in Shadow.

1776 2018-10-08 20:36:22 Yes bcoz Buhari didn't approve his expired oil blocks license.
1777 2018-10-08 20:36:12 America creates conflict for countries with oil so that they can be in control of it n if Nigeria can decide to sell their oil using a different currency American will be in trouble

Don't use veg. Oil
1786 2018-10-08 20:34:26 That’s global factors or a 30,000 ft view. We need tomdrill down, a deep dive into each factor individually over a period of time such as oil, natural gas, discovery of diamonds, etc & their impact on economy. This study specifically tracked  impact from carbon pricing: 3ft up.
1787 2018-10-08 20:34:24 Fuck would you know, you stick to worktops I’ll stick to crafting food btw - Premium Yorkshire Rapeseed Oil is used rather than Olive - Buying British mate only way!!

1789 2018-10-08 20:34:22 deficit spending is a fact of life for any government.. It's how you spend it that matters.

Spending for right wing causes like ramming through oil pipelines or tax giveaways to corporations and people make 200K like Trudeau has done is the problem.

1799 2018-10-08 20:33:19 India should ask US for alternate source of supply of oil to India. If not answered, it has to go ahead to purchase from Iran.

1802 2018-10-08 20:33:07 None of us should have to do that. I am going to break a few CBT rules by saying this but sometimes I feel like saying: 'Apologists for the oil industry and those who want to drive and park anywhere should hang their heads in shame!'
1803 2018-10-08 20:33:07 Voting for whichever presidential candidate will launch every lifestyle hack, influencer n snake oil salesman into the sun.
1804 2018-10-08 20:33:03 Are we still planning on using oil revenue to service the foreign currency denominated debt? Do we have a stable forecast of oil prices for the next 10-20 yrs? Are we planning on initiating a swap deal that will serve as an exchange rate for when we plan to start debt servicing?
1805 2018-10-08 20:32:46 Norway based their “Heritage” fund on Zlougheed’s original vision. In other words, they consulted Us. Then when Lougheed was no longer premier, the wise management of our oil funds turned into a pillage
1806 2018-10-08 20:32:43 Paida you think people enjoying paying these high prices? “Avoid buying” is for those who have other options once you use the last drop of cooking oil you have no option. In any case the $3.70 is US$ and the 10 is in zanu money! Its not gege gege 1:1
1807 2018-10-08 20:32:25 Take your time "Oil Tot". Don't rush! We will still be here whenever your done!
1808 2018-10-08 20:32:07 @realDonaldTrump Bolton and dignitaries who are really opposed to the Iranian regime should do all they can to completely shut off Iran's oil exports until November 4th.Our people have hoped for you and didnot leave them,finish the work of the evil regime of Iran,Enough is enough

1810 2018-10-08 20:31:54 Those companies exist because we buy their shit. Look at the list: Shell, Chevron, Marathon Oil. They are the biggest contributors BECAUSE we are driving cars, using A/C, and eating animal products. That's the point. If poor people in India can reduce A/C (and they do), we can.

1815 2018-10-08 20:31:28 Saint John is the biggest Canadian oil refinery, able to process about  300,000 barrels a day of crude. About half of the plant’s fuel is sent  to the northeast U.S, making it a key provider of gasoline and diesel to  New York and New England.
1816 2018-10-08 20:31:27 Most of Oil/Gas related program is part of the 2023-2030 window..to date the program's projects are under evaluation while key infrastructure projects linking the future facilities are implemented..
Unlike the 2018 election oriented marketing in Pak.. CPEC has a 2030 horizon
1817 2018-10-08 20:31:25 I think the same argument applies to any rent-seeking behavior, which owning the oil pipeline ostensibly is nowadays.
1818 2018-10-08 20:31:19 Réouverture de la route: l'avenue Grandview est maintenant ouverte. Toutes les routes sont maintenant ouvertes depuis l'incident d'Irving Oil.
1819 2018-10-08 20:31:17 I’m still interested to see how retail pricing works in the Oil Industry. The previous Govt attempted to get this info too. Were they just humouring us?
1820 2018-10-08 20:31:16 Ha! You are too kind, Ray........I have lots of fun with words, but I am not worthy to change Kim's guitar strings (or even clean them with baby oil). He's the Master!
1821 2018-10-08 20:31:10 Mostly just want to kick start the recovery process ASAP. Hence the collagen, a healthy meal, and fish oil post workout
1822 2018-10-08 20:31:07 If "Conservatives" are all about conserving things, why aren't they rolling hard with the environmentalists who are all about conserving the planet? Instead they roll with oil companies who are rat-fucking the environment.

1831 2018-10-08 20:29:42 As a bartender that is land locked in AB, that you have no idea how the shipping industry operates. Nor the crappy legislation that's in place to protect our country from companies like this one. So how about AB underwrites all the oil spill clean ups in good faith.
1832 2018-10-08 20:29:34 Soap or cleanser or baby oil. Those make-up wipes are a scourge on the environment. Don’t buy them!!
1833 2018-10-08 20:29:19 Coming up on a special edition of CTV News at 6 with @CTVAnchor Steve Murphy, we'll have coverage of the explosion and fire at the Irving Oil refinery in #SaintJohn. @KellyLinehanCTV, @LauraLyallCTV, @KWalkerCTV, @MikeCameronCTV, and @NickMooreCTV have been working on the story.
1834 2018-10-08 20:29:18 Been back at it for 2 hours today. 3 trucks stuck, 1 mud flap ripped off, and one set of oil well battery steps destroyed. Oh all by 1 truck driver. Great day so far. #sendit. #Harvest18

So I’m seeing how adding cbd oil to my intake helps 
Hoping to relieve anxiety and depression and increase my good moods
1837 2018-10-08 20:28:27 Whats intermittent about renewable? My central heating isn't connected to an oil refinery. Storage is the answer. The waste from nuclear rules it out. We have to stop passing on a poisonous legacy for future generations.
1838 2018-10-08 20:28:27 They hope that if they are involved they can get it done..giving money to the investors is subsidizing the oil industry that is what K & M do is oil
1839 2018-10-08 20:28:23 All pollution of our planet, the air we breathe, oil and plastic in our oceans,depletion of our rain forests,pesticide and all chemicals used in food growing.

1841 2018-10-08 20:28:22 i want to be a suburban mom and get a spray bottle to fill with olive oil so i can mist my potatoes with it to make them crispier when i broil them
1842 2018-10-08 20:28:17 Why though?  Big oil sells them the energy to charge those batteries.  Do people not realize that???
1843 2018-10-08 20:28:13 Same tbh... gotta stop buying wraps and use my glass blunt more idk anyone here who sells wax pens :/ well u know the oil
1844 2018-10-08 20:28:12 You are misleading people. 1 cubic mile of oil is 4 trillion litres. In 2017 Canadians consumed 108 billion litres of refined petroleum products, 79% towards transportation fuel. In other words, your picture is for 40 years of Canadian 2017 consumption habits. Oil propaganda.

You don't need cube in your beans with the right proportions of onions,pepper and palm oil 
1848 2018-10-08 20:27:55 If folk want to talk about pollution, we should probably start with the oil industry. Fracking. Rare earth metals. As well as the human addiction to all things plastic. That one is pretty dire & vegans want all sorts of faux stuff that are just plastics by another name...
1849 2018-10-08 20:27:45 Is this only if we hit oil ?
1850 2018-10-08 20:27:42 For years Retailers  have had immediate price rises at the pump when Oil prices rise. Price gouging for gas they’d already received and paid for.
1851 2018-10-08 20:27:41 Oil and gas interests pay protesters against 112 so you can’t fathom people loving their country enough to protest for free? Or in my case, take my lunch break for it?

1853 2018-10-08 20:27:32 Well we should all do what we can, but until countries stop burning coal, oil and eventually gas (in that order) to produce energy and/or start pulling CO2 from the atmosphere on a huge scale, my LED light-bulbs aren't going to save us.

1855 2018-10-08 20:27:30 Defango can you give me the real picture of Clint Murchison, oil man who Johnson Nixon and all the rest who had meeting with, I don't know if the video I looked at a year ago, which I now can't find, because the video looks like Peter of Burnell Road@defangolives
1856 2018-10-08 20:27:27 That isn’t how it works, obesity is a very complicated thing we barely understand outside of snake oil salespeople and fads. We know exercise plays far less of a point than is peddled. And access to healthy food and the time to prepare it is hard. Genetics & epigenetics too.
1857 2018-10-08 20:27:27 I dont think i can go another year without a Grenadian oil down. Its potentially suicidal
1858 2018-10-08 20:27:26 Oil price increasing everyday and no corresponding improvement in Nigeria's economy. Where are you people packing the money, APC government.
1859 2018-10-08 20:27:15 It was an eye opener for me but was too late. I would never recommend a root canal. I had a heart attack during the yr long infection. Only left to do damage control now. I do oil pulling, oil of oregano, a red/blue light treatment etc. in my mouth. Never ending. Sigh
1860 2018-10-08 20:27:04 only me that could mistake pure cinnamon oil as massage oil, end up with chemical burns n spend the night on the phone to 111fun date night for me and joey x

1862 2018-10-08 20:26:45 NNP global Canada now introduce the world leading >90% Epax concentrated Omega 3 Fish oil of Norway to the Canada market.
1863 2018-10-08 20:26:44 Oooh , his oil light just came on 
1864 2018-10-08 20:26:25 Yes and the industry knew that was coming. I used to deal with an O&G company that changed its operating cost model well before the white paper was released, to assume the cost of a barrel of oil would drop to $30US.
1865 2018-10-08 20:26:12 That beard needs some beard oil in it!!
1866 2018-10-08 20:26:05 there's mold in more than just the Caprisuns! I gonna have to say the black shit in boxes of motor oil in plastic bags(they call them ecoboxes too! how stupid!) has mold as well. it's definitely not oil!
1867 2018-10-08 20:25:58 I dont think that @jacindaardern is confused, the thing that has changed is that the NZ Dollar is down, and the Crude Oil Price is up = expensive petrol. Maybe try an alternative to cars to save on the petrol. We need to start dropping fossil fuels. Make the change and stop lying
1868 2018-10-08 20:25:56 anyone else find it strange that the same day or day after the NYT publishes a story claiming that Trump isn't really a Billionaire Melania heads for the Oil Reserves
1869 2018-10-08 20:25:44 First read through was rough but enjoyable. A few sections need work, so I guess the midnight oil will be burning on my side tonight!
1870 2018-10-08 20:25:19 Logic: Intro tax and once introduced cannot reduce because greedy oil companies would gobble benefit up. Have to maintain taxes to ensure consumer resistance to prices to keep control on profits.

1882 2018-10-08 20:24:22 If they cared about us not using oil then why not make oil $5,000 per litre so only rich types like @RusselNorman can afford to use their car?

1885 2018-10-08 20:24:14 Time for a oil change and tune-up.
1886 2018-10-08 20:24:12 Only the oil companies want the pipelines over the rail system.  Their profit is much higher with pipelines, because there are fewer people to pay and it is a quicker fix for them. All though real data not from the oil companies show way more damage from the pipelines bursting.
1887 2018-10-08 20:24:10 Get some vick or olbus oil, it will help even though if you put it into a tissue or your body
1888 2018-10-08 20:23:59 I last used cooking oil and salt 5 years ago. I use peanut butter, mhiripiri. My blood pressure is normal now  no more pills .
1889 2018-10-08 20:23:42 Make cities green spaces, ban cars in city centres, divest from fossil fuels, make public transport run on renewables and use it more often, increase tax on oil, ditch meat and dairy, improve agricultural efficiency, buy local, invest in renewable energy, THAT'S A START.

1891 2018-10-08 20:23:40 any oil in the river?
1892 2018-10-08 20:23:26 Until such time as the fuel companies are taking more in profits than the government takes in taxes, I think @jacindaardern should sit down and shut up. We’re being fleeced alright - but it’s not by the oil companies.
1893 2018-10-08 20:23:20 There's this salt scrub that I use on my body. And I know physical exfoliants aren't good for the skin but YHO! My skin feels like butter. After the scrub, I used the Vaseline cocoa butter gel oil. Add this to the fact that I just changed my sheets... Good night world.
1894 2018-10-08 20:23:18 i would rather drink motor oil than be here rn
1895 2018-10-08 20:23:13 I doubt it is so much about Trump understanding, as it is about doing what the oil and coal barons order!

1897 2018-10-08 20:22:53 We will use the same currency that the English will use to buy our oil and gas
1898 2018-10-08 20:22:49 Thank God the money borrow was for infrastructures and not to pay salaries. Hope u never forget wen there was oil boom we borrow to pay salaries. Ask ur governors,senator, HOR and Hoa questions and don't divert ur anger towards buhari alone. Our problem is complex

1902 2018-10-08 20:22:36 The binary 'end of the world' view so many good people have is enraging. Its literally exactly what the oil barons and energy CEOs want you to think like. Deny until you can't, then claim theres nothing we can do anyways.
1903 2018-10-08 20:22:36 Yeah probably. They showed it first on televista before Zeeworld. Now they said due to popular demand they returned it.

1907 2018-10-08 20:22:15 Yes. As you let the pressure off a little the gasses are released like champagne bubbles and lift the oil. By using a choke you control the gas release to get the get the optimum lift and flow. Hopefully far more than any pump!
1908 2018-10-08 20:22:14 Ha! Fosshotel? Probably gets paid in cod liver oil.
1909 2018-10-08 20:22:07 $PEIX generated $2/sh of cash flow when ethanol markets were healthy. High oil prices and low corn prices are favorable, but China exports plummeted. Farmers need higher ethanol and Trump working on this for obvious political reasons. I think it’s an interesting situation
1910 2018-10-08 20:22:06 Still remember the doomsdays clock @rushlimbaugh used to have on his website. Useless like AlGore prognostications Rush took it down.  How much money has Al made out of this snake oil?
1911 2018-10-08 20:22:05 “So, yes the Pioppi Diet will probably work quite well, if you can afford it. After all it is based on eating plenty of vegetables, with lean meat, nuts and olive oil – all mainstays of the evidenced approaches.”
1912 2018-10-08 20:21:59 I agree. I think this may be because the coal/oil/gas industry is driving a strong attack, so we get in the habit of defending the CO2 aspect. Though the models routinely include solar, volcano, aerosol, and oceans .

1928 2018-10-08 20:20:24 Help me understand what would motivate someone(“big oil”) to knowingly adopt a practice (selling fossil fuels) that would put the entire planet (including their families) at risk. The answer is, they wouldn’t.
1929 2018-10-08 20:20:17 Yep. The oil and gas industry is not monolithic. The political fault lines in our province are not just between left/right, NDP/UCP: they are also between the energy realists and the energy dinosaurs within the oil and gas industry itself. Let’s hope the dinosaurs don’t prevail.
1930 2018-10-08 20:20:02 anyone else find it strange that the same day or day after the NYT publishes a story claiming that Trump isn't really a Billionaire Melania heads for the Oil Reserves
1931 2018-10-08 20:19:59 yes i know that obama enacted unprecedented and historic legislation to help stem the cataclysm that is climate change but have you seen this out of context clip about him talking about all that sweet oil
1932 2018-10-08 20:19:55 And here are the list of events that happened in the country while u were away. Sugar 2.3 to 2.8, ckng oil 4.80 to 10.35, m/meal 6.00 to 8$, fuel 1.43 to 1.53/l, and USD at your unofficial trade floors is now 230 bond for a 100. For how long d u think we will keep quiet sir?
1933 2018-10-08 20:19:41 And with oil breaking out, doesn't seem like a great environment for utes.
1934 2018-10-08 20:19:37 Better impose crippling taxes and shut down the entire oil industry then. Since 98% of all CO2 is produced naturally, it won’t do a thing to change anything

1944 2018-10-08 20:18:55 You talked about green subsidies, which also return more then invested, so it is fair game to apply the same to oil. I actually would love to see your s "qualifications". I don't quite believe your claims. Especially sharing questionable sources. Big oil sponsered?

1989 2018-10-08 20:15:00 Yours looks newish judging by the gauge. Could mean a 3 dollar quart of oil or low pressure which could be bad. Ever over heat the engine?
1990 2018-10-08 20:14:52 okay I’d get the jojoba oil, it’s at spencers. It helps with numbing and stretching
1991 2018-10-08 20:14:52 Russia does have a seriously big vested interest in discrediting American agriculture and biotechnology.  Oil and gas, grain, and weapons are their only significant exports.
1992 2018-10-08 20:14:46 Redford has been out of place with real Americans for 50 years.
1993 2018-10-08 20:14:45 Tengu Man smooched Oil Man don't you agree?
1994 2018-10-08 20:14:43 Saudi Arabia sent the 9-11 terrorists and Saudi Arabia murders Yemen children aided by America but no one says anything! America sells much weaponry to and Saudi oil fields are full Americans but now Saudis have murdered a reporter in the Saudi embassy in Turkey..no more silence!
1995 2018-10-08 20:14:41 Just like us running out of oil by 2050 something...
1996 2018-10-08 20:14:33 “...Cant be more cleaner/ da oil spill dat BP ain’t cleaned up/I’m anti-Santa Maria/The only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace...”
1997 2018-10-08 20:14:33 They lied there, they use Willowton oil that they get from Willowton Pietmaritzburg. And those use sunflower seed   .
1998 2018-10-08 20:14:19 snake oil Al, ....he must be low on funds
1999 2018-10-08 20:14:06 Stock market drop is due to oil prices, dont blame to the govt..
Just check out the stock index of newyork london and mumbai and then u will understand its not just happening in Pakistan but across the world.
This happens due to recent clash b/w TRUMP and OPEC countries.
2000 2018-10-08 20:14:03 PTS Tip:  Is your car ready for the break?  Make sure to check your tires, oil, battery, etc. before you leave for Fall Break. #wku #wkuhrl
2001 2018-10-08 20:14:03 u ever want to eat nutella but then you remember it isnt vegan because of the palm oil
2002 2018-10-08 20:14:00 This d third time they r showing that the promise on DSTV. Begusarai Kuma has almost stopped making sense. Lakhan has become soft, phulan is still locked away, priyom is dead, bindiya is confused, mithelesh is dumb, poonam's pretty Muslim friend is Missing. Sigh
2003 2018-10-08 20:13:56 i’m so irritated my mama put all this fuckin oil in my hair
2004 2018-10-08 20:13:51 Te salteaste la palabra invierno.
Comprensión de texto?

Es normal exportar en verano e importar para los picos de invierno.
En verano exportamos fuel oil y gas oil.
Lo haces ex profeso o es natural?
2005 2018-10-08 20:13:50 The trouble is...... The Saudis could take us all back to the stone age in an instant if they switched the oil off. In other words, they have us exactly where they want us... By the balls.
2006 2018-10-08 20:13:47 Change your oil on schedule #Giveaway #Tradeup2SCOTT
2007 2018-10-08 20:13:30 I love how oil proponents make assumtions.
My family works in Fort Mc, my uncle ran one of the biggest union in the Tar Sands. He had copies of the subsidies. Because I go green doesn't mean I am anti oil, or fossil fuels. However I agree with increasing new green tech
2008 2018-10-08 20:13:09 Politics. If Spain has another 26 EU leaders telling it to do otherwise, then it will. And the prospect of keeping the largest puddle of oil in Europe within the EU, might just be the convincing argument. Politics.
2009 2018-10-08 20:13:05 There’s a thought. I have some lavender oil on order to see if that helps.
2010 2018-10-08 20:12:47 Smh!! Been calling around and looking for CLOVE OIL 

WHO KNOWS WHERE I CAN GET SOME RIGHT NOW !!! Please!!!!!
2011 2018-10-08 20:12:46 Linden & Pierson today everyone ... Til 6, as we raise money for the Hurley Breast Health Navigation Program! Stop by get an oil change and have some ice cream from Cops and Robbers! 
2012 2018-10-08 20:12:32 The best way to protect corporate balance sheets & jobs at the moment is to:

1. Allow prices to be pegged in dollars & float the rate 

2. Remove all subsidies for fuel, grains, edible oil etc

In one week the madness will be gone

And life will begin in earnest!
2013 2018-10-08 20:12:13 Shell divested from oil sands to pay down debt from its untimely purchase of BG Group. It had a major case of indigestion at the time. Shell is also going on the "greener" side. Shell got into the oil sands to begin with to deal with earlier misstating of global reserves.
2014 2018-10-08 20:11:56 Nick snuck off while Eldon and I took a nap to get my oil changed and tires rotated AND THEN came home with flowers and asked me on a date. Stay tuned for upcoming pregnancy announcement.
2015 2018-10-08 20:11:49 These people HATE you or at the very least couldn’t give any less of a shit about you, because they’re preoccupied with the lobbyists lubricating their dicks with crude oil and jerking off their crusty old man chodes.

GET THE FUCK OUT THERE AND VOTE THEM OUT.
2016 2018-10-08 20:11:48 Pretty sure Jan is correct the jump from E10 to E15 isn't that great and the octane increases (fuel burns hotter). You might see a slight mileage loss, but a power boost??? Tractors and combines are diesel. They already burn B20 (20% soybean oil).
2017 2018-10-08 20:11:40 How do propose to lower dependence on fossil fuels? What is your alternative energy source?  Oil and gas are not subsidized in Canada.
2018 2018-10-08 20:11:25 Low oil pressure. I suggest burning it and getting a new car cuz maintenance is a bitch
2019 2018-10-08 20:11:20 Newly opened Atlantic Sunrise pipeline opens door for Cabot Oil & Gas
2020 2018-10-08 20:11:18 @LindsayGrahamSC tied to Russia oil, oligarchs, campaign cash @FBIWFO where was @nytimes @washingtonpost on that last week as he hysterically attacked others for Putin’s Judge? @JudiciaryDems
2021 2018-10-08 20:11:17 Just did my hair about to shave and shower and coconut oil my whole body down  I’m gonna feel great
2022 2018-10-08 20:11:06 As the world’s largest economy the US has the most to lose from climate change. Instead of embracing technologies that can help to ween us off of oil and coal the GOP has chose to embrace the destruction of our planet.
2023 2018-10-08 20:11:02 I went to the shop this evening, there was no cooking oil
2024 2018-10-08 20:10:51 Spent my day of getting the oil changed and cleaning the house...now I'm about to cook 
2025 2018-10-08 20:10:51 Thought I was finna get an oil change before I got on the road but fuck that shit. They’ll see me in 2 weeks
2026 2018-10-08 20:10:48 I can see why those who deny climate science tend to like oil, because in the same way, they float on rising sea levels. They'd say they're dense than us. But they aren't. They just have yachts.
2027 2018-10-08 20:10:36 159, и я довольна ростом, ровно до тех пор, пока меня не зовут "мелкой". Каблуки не ношу, но с детства тоже проблемы с ногами(боль в суставах). От этого чую себя старой бабкой.
2028 2018-10-08 20:10:32 Sussed Murphy out the day I saw/hear him......snake oil he was selling.

2031 2018-10-08 20:10:05 Hi if the USA  is due to become a major exporter of oil/petroleum why isn’t this driving down cost across the major economies & therefore increasing profitable trade ?
2032 2018-10-08 20:10:04 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
2033 2018-10-08 20:10:03 Warm avocado oil scalp massage >>>> men.
2034 2018-10-08 20:10:02 Great work by first responders at the Irving Oil Refinery explosion in Saint John, New Brunswick. Wishing a swift recovery to injured workers.
2035 2018-10-08 20:09:47 Sometimes when I go to metal shows, I really want to ask the bands with vans if they’ve gotten an oil change recently... or when the last time they’ve rotated their tires... or used a fuel injector... these things matter.
2036 2018-10-08 20:09:44 Hybrid options come as low as $1500 now. You can buy a chevy bolt for $35k. Even if you don’t subsidize them, you REMOVE oil subsidies. You have artifically cheap fuel right now.
2037 2018-10-08 20:09:35 I've worked on oil palm issues since 2006, and I can say that the sector has improved so much over the past decade. All consumer and NGO pressure. In Indonesia, a lot of palm oil is produced by small farmers.
2038 2018-10-08 20:09:32 French have had assets there forever. LE used to be used as a deterrent against any attacks on Total oil assets in the region. Allegedly
2039 2018-10-08 20:09:28 It helps me deal with anxiety and insomnia, without making me groggy the whole next day.  I don't utilize cannabis every single day but without it, I would be suffering.  CBD oil helps with my degenerative disc disease.
2040 2018-10-08 20:09:16 no way did this girl check that the poppers wasnt lavender oil bc she is allergic
2041 2018-10-08 20:09:12 Thank you my brother. Countries like Korea, Japan and Germany. They have no oil. But their economy is so strong
2042 2018-10-08 20:09:03 Exactly, problem is there are R’s in the state with fond memories of his governorship that are buying this snake oil. They don’t realize that unless he holds the partisan line he will disappear into a powerless black hole.
2043 2018-10-08 20:08:56 An economy dependent on a single export, no infrastructure spending, an assumption oil prices would stay high.

Those don't really apply to the US.
2044 2018-10-08 20:08:54 “Stop! For gods sake, you’re acting like a child Dean! I told you why the holy oil affected her. But I guess you weren’t listening.” Jophiel turns Lex around to look at her face. “Do you want to go with him? I’m leaving it up to you, like it should be.”
2045 2018-10-08 20:08:41 Yeah. But we won't. And many of us will die. We'll see our grand cities sink beneath the ocean's water. We'll see island communities die out as their lands disappear. 

But at least the CEOs of coal, gas, and oil companies will have their bonuses. So... we got that going for us.
2046 2018-10-08 20:08:39 Metal Silver News→  Chris Vermeulen: Prepare For A #Gold & #Silver Rally, But What About Crude Oil?: Chris says the rally in gold & silver…
2047 2018-10-08 20:08:29 Just give oil blocks to other Nigerians and see if they won't  invest in Nigeria; you appropriate Nigeria's money and then claim to have investments, but it takes one thief to know another, as birds of the feathers flock together.
2048 2018-10-08 20:07:56 Got CBD oil. On deck.  Fwm legally.
2049 2018-10-08 20:07:42 Repubs return to the party of Ike, Dems return to the party of FDR-JFK, would be a damn good step in the right direction. But Big Everything (Big Pharma, Big Oil, etc) won't let if happen.
2050 2018-10-08 20:07:34 But for all the meetings with impressive dudes, cooking oil is still above $7,00. Impressive, isn't it? Tekinokirati.
2051 2018-10-08 20:07:25 Victim chic.
2052 2018-10-08 20:07:19 Adrian...do you like spread sheets ?
2053 2018-10-08 20:07:15 I have the most awkward guy changing my oil rinow and i too am very awkward and it’s all super uncomfy (-:

2059 2018-10-08 20:06:37 So why did Shell Oil wait until last year to pull out of Alberta? After Trudeau cancelled Energy East and Northern Gateway??
2060 2018-10-08 20:06:25 I’ll probably die from cancer or something, but I’ll always add tea tree oil to my netty pot mix till the day I die #AnythingToBreathe
2061 2018-10-08 20:06:22 Biafrans are Christians, oil and waters doesn't,walk together,
2062 2018-10-08 20:06:20 Omg I need to do that! I’ve done Vaseline before and it works pretty well too but I did watch a YouTube video on castor oil so now imma try that! Thank you 
2063 2018-10-08 20:06:15 No No No! I didn't mean that you are teaching false doctrine
I was intending to ADD to what you were saying
I am sorry that I wasn't clear about that!  
You spoke of 'wrong oil' and that's the false doctrine I was referring to.
I'll have to be more careful..
2064 2018-10-08 20:06:14 Haha really ?? Just listen to Trump las speech :"if you stop paying you will not survive more than 1 week". Second is killing opponents and journalist in consulate part of 2030 vision?
 No faith, no civilization , Saudia is an oil station built by UK on extremism and perversion.
2065 2018-10-08 20:05:44 I've never had cod liver oil. You must be thinking of @ElFakidor.
2066 2018-10-08 20:05:44 Well it’s all guesswork. Dollar at 150 meaning a 40% depreciation in 1 year and therefore prices of all imported items including oil & gas will go up by that much.Therefore Govt will not accept it come what may. I think Rupee will stay between 130 to 135 which is a fair value.
2067 2018-10-08 20:05:40 Need to drill offshore for oil and gas in Florida
2068 2018-10-08 20:05:36 He has not aged well. Heart throb handsome when he was young. So sad.
2069 2018-10-08 20:05:24 Just put 2 boiled eggs in a calabash, add red oil and red cloth, take a pic and send to him. Then leave the rest for the gods
2070 2018-10-08 20:05:16 Were they using oil? Did they have a card honestly?   Do you have to throw in their job description, did they harm any children, or were they a loving couple doing a good job?  Is there more to the story than you are telling more information from coworkers employees parents.
2071 2018-10-08 20:05:16 lmaooooooooooo In your mind now you have discovered oil . So you just went to look for another subtweet with hoe in it
2072 2018-10-08 20:04:55 Our thoughts go out to all those impacted by the major incident which occurred earlier today at the Irving Oil Refinery.

Nos pensées accompagnent toutes les personnes touchées par l'incident majeur qui s'est produit plus tôt aujourd'hui à la raffinerie Irving Oil.
2073 2018-10-08 20:04:53 Sigh. I’m looking forward to seeing National’s secret plan to fight international increases in oil prices, a resurgent USD and inflation. As a typical Nat voter, this wilful obtuseness is getting old.
2074 2018-10-08 20:04:44 i put castor oil on them every other day @ night before i go to bed! & i get them waxed like every two weeks 
2075 2018-10-08 20:04:35 Weird how men on the left start looking more like like ugly women as they get older. Must be the sharp drop in testosterone
2076 2018-10-08 20:04:21 Esto es periodismo?
2077 2018-10-08 20:04:18 滅多に連泊できないので、限界まで楽しむのです…！笑
2078 2018-10-08 20:04:12 Semi-related, but maybe not worthy of being a standalone tweet (why I’m posting it as a reply): I feel a lot of the world’s conflict would go away if oil were devalued (think near 0). Land, wealth, shady business dealings, oil spills, warning, and so on…so much of it is oil.
2079 2018-10-08 20:04:11 Wide open for you! 
There's the border! 
Don't let it hits you in the a$$ on the way OUT.
2080 2018-10-08 20:04:09 According to @Forbes on 10-5-2018 Saudi Arabia may be cutting oil to us thanks to the threats of @realDonaldTrump.
2081 2018-10-08 20:04:03 what do you use with oil paint? i wanna start but i have no idea what to buy lmao
2082 2018-10-08 20:03:57 He’s so ungrateful for what this country gave him.
2083 2018-10-08 20:03:48 I recognise that oil cloth - bravo Milady
2084 2018-10-08 20:03:47 He is right, and we're the people working to bring it back. MAGA!!!!!!
2085 2018-10-08 20:03:45 So I started putting coconut oil in my puppy’s food... Now the lil terror licks an empty bowl for 5 minutes just to make sure it’s gone
2086 2018-10-08 20:03:20 You incentivize people buying them to help them become cheaper. Solar panels are luxuries too, but we should subsidize them. Ffs if you want to talk about subsidies, how about the billions we give to fucking oil companies? I drive a gas car and I'm 110% for EV subsidies
2087 2018-10-08 20:03:19 Why am I just now hearing about Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides?
2088 2018-10-08 20:03:19 So many drone pilots who think this scaremongering twat is ok? I guess taking out kids is ok under the banner of terror, in the name of oil .
2089 2018-10-08 20:03:04 Intel is into transportation of gas and crude oil in Nigeria you can also confirm this Bro
2090 2018-10-08 20:03:03 as if things couldn’t get any fucking worse.. the people who changed my oil fucked up my car

2092 2018-10-08 20:02:54 Them thar oil Barons came calling. 
2093 2018-10-08 20:02:46 Facts do bother me but for the reason they are, as said, facts.
In 2017 my customers were using 686k gallons less oil&gas(eqv.) for heating than previous year. This year will end up in the range of 840-875k gallons (weather).
I still suck on my personal consumption habits.
2094 2018-10-08 20:02:29 Oil company's still fleecing American's every day !!!
2095 2018-10-08 20:02:06 Never thought I’d cry over olive trees with @simon_reeve #Mediterranean @bbc2 made me realise how lucky I am to have delicious organic oil from dad in #Greece - can’t imagine life without the peppery liquid gold #oliveoil
2096 2018-10-08 20:02:01 I don’t know how I managed to write ‘olive oil’ so wrong, my autocorrect thought I meant ‘police’. 

Yes. I love tagliatelle tossed in police.

2106 2018-10-08 20:01:34 hey my love in a pan you goes put the hams but before you goes put in a other pan in stoven with twelve spoon of oil you goes fry a garlic and medium and medium onion .. after put salt .. ohh you might put any potato also.. but first you goes flake and after put any six to poach

2112 2018-10-08 20:01:13 So true. His wicked 95/5% development. Termination of Pipeline security contracts to Niger Deltans. Termination of amnesty. Cancellation of Maritime Univ. Refusal to clean spil, etc infuriated NDA. They rose up crippled Naija oil income. Plus failing oil prices. RECESSION SET.
2113 2018-10-08 20:01:08 shit vegetable oil which is way more omega-6 than a person needs, sending the omega-3: 6 ratio out of balance. We need more 3 than 6, and the best source is a high-quality supplemental fish oil, try to get one that

Don't listen to me
2118 2018-10-08 20:00:36 what oil was used, the hygiene of the place it was made in, whether it was fried, grilled, barbied, etc. These seemingly little factors make a significant difference. Knowing what things are like there, the oil used was probably

2123 2018-10-08 19:59:39 My success is measured by my enemies’ desperate attacks. #SaudiArabia is not even a sovereign legit country: A barbaric British puppet colony set up to further barbaric cult trend financed by oil owned & operated by ‘others’- filth land
2124 2018-10-08 19:59:35 Now I know you’re kidding. No one can be that foolish.     This wouldn’t be socialism’s second chance. More like their 22nd chance and it failed miserably every time. Venezuela went from a wealthy country blessed with profitable oil assets to a starving population.
2125 2018-10-08 19:59:31 For instance, the Tesla fans who insist that the Kochs and Big Oil are conspiring with media against Tesla.

And the Pizzagate conspiracy theorists who insist that George Soros is conspiring with politicians and the media to cover up a pedophilia ring.
2126 2018-10-08 19:59:22 He damned sure wouldn't want to live in the country if it was like it was when he was born. Them were the good times for sure.
2127 2018-10-08 19:59:20 My oil treatment for my hair is the shit
2128 2018-10-08 19:59:13 My gr8 gr8 uncles travelled from NZ to South Africa to fight in Boer War, Granddad fought in WWI, Dad in WWII - ALL faced pain & death but did it willingly so we, their children could live. AND today we're complaining cos getting rid of oil & finding other ways is too hard?
2129 2018-10-08 19:58:58 The travesty of @realDonaldTrump policies is clearly demonstrated in the attacks his Administration is doing  on our #NationalParks By allowing hunting, mining. oil drilling costing future generations to lose one of our greatest natural assets all for $$$ #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
2130 2018-10-08 19:58:57 I will tell him for you.
You aren't as rude as me. Re read my message..(  )

2131 2018-10-08 19:58:51 Can somone explain to me why they only have one lane open here at this @jiffylube... Not entirely in a rush but there are more ppl here waiting 

Like this one dude is just on his phone out there, yall could easily be getting my oil changed in the second lane.
2132 2018-10-08 19:58:50 Olive Oil Was The Start of Family Empire
2133 2018-10-08 19:58:42 If you feel that way Robert : GTFO !!
2134 2018-10-08 19:58:37 We had those feelings during Obama's years.

MN Gov Dayton, in December 2015, told Minnesotans "if you don't like all the immigration,  you can MOVE OUT."  Remember that in November, Minnesotans.
2135 2018-10-08 19:58:19 A country which tracks cooking oil availability or lack of it  lacks probity.
2136 2018-10-08 19:58:18 falling right along with the pedo crowd!!
2137 2018-10-08 19:58:16 im just trying to figure out how the hell you brake a piece of the radiator trying to do an oil change? 
2138 2018-10-08 19:58:14 Coconut oil!!
2139 2018-10-08 19:58:14 What will you do when oil runs out?

"Wealth creation" is future destruction.
2140 2018-10-08 19:58:10 Think theres plenty more bigger than psg an all your obvious arsenal chelsea's inters etc but likes of ajax aswell some oil money recent domestic honours an a few big stars dont make them bigger than clubs we prestige history
2141 2018-10-08 19:58:08  US Government swung into action to stabilize Stock Markets. Bond yield will stabilize as pension funds will start buying very soon, Sanction on Iran will be mellowed down and Crude OIL will not be allowed to increase further.

2142 2018-10-08 19:58:04 Sure yes. No argument. But you can't fault the primary determinant of Nigerian FX which is basically what we realised from oil revenue. 
While those SME invested through FDI, they are still not the major determinant of Nigeria's FX.

2148 2018-10-08 19:57:26 @jaredpolis Hypocrite. You can’t say you’re acting on climate and advocate for the expansion of fracked oil & gas & new fossil fuel infrastructure. Classic Third Way “predatory delay” based on market-based environmentalism. #copolitics #coleg

2150 2018-10-08 19:57:23 Dana doesn’t care.  He takes big oil and gas money.  He’s old and not looking to the future.

You wasted a lot of money on a so called Christian education and now besmirch the good name of Concordia College every time you open your cruel mouth. How dare you?
Your classmates have your number. Oil money.
2152 2018-10-08 19:57:07 Why is petrol cheaper in Auckland (with a levy) than in Christchurch (without a levy). Me think the Oil companies charge is not based on fuel taxes

2154 2018-10-08 19:57:05 More per head spending in Scotland yes, but due to Westminster borrowing on behalf of Scotland for projects (with no benefit to people in Scotland) in London, HS rail etc. Look into the facts, England will sink without revenues from oil & gas as independence is coming, so prepare
2155 2018-10-08 19:56:54 Tea tree oil and vitamin E
2156 2018-10-08 19:56:54 Why does everyone want an oil change today?!? Shit I wanna go home now!!
2157 2018-10-08 19:56:49 if you actually give a shit about climate change, support nuclear fission and the research of nuclear fusion
the global oil cartel will never stop polluting the earth if it still has all the nations of the world by the dick in terms of energy production
2158 2018-10-08 19:56:47 I wonder if the oil industry have been funding the UK think tanks that funded Brexit that won’t reveal their funding? And likewise Trump on US?
2159 2018-10-08 19:56:46 Can I volunteer for the gushing ?
2160 2018-10-08 19:56:45 When OBAMA shut down oil production (2 try 2 move 2 green energy) I said making USA dependent on mid east countries 4 oil was a nat'l security risk! If it came to a world wide event going against US mid east could deny oil & shut down economy!
2161 2018-10-08 19:56:42 #BBCAskThis why is this government not encouraging the simple conversion of all plastics back to oil and gas, rather than expensively subsidised drilling to add to the pollution
2162 2018-10-08 19:56:38 Unfortunately, the American party that is owned by big oil (@gop) will continue to cater to its interests, and will keep their followers convinced that the entire rest of the world, and over 90% of climate scientists, are making it all up.
2163 2018-10-08 19:56:35 you mean apart from it being made up. To suggest traditions Italians don't eat pasta and bread but do eat cauliflower pizza and coconut oil is just ridiculous.
2164 2018-10-08 19:56:30 Me too. Remember to make the £/$ rate a variable cell. Than you can adjust your sheet as the pound recovers.

“No,” she huffs.

2175 2018-10-08 19:55:31 The Chinese and french men(who came to steal our oil) made T-shirts am sure they will b celebrating all over the streets ..... and having V.I.P seats at the yellow-celebration
2176 2018-10-08 19:55:22 Do not apply baby oil. I repeat DO NOT. This irritation will disappear in 2days of you keep aerated and dry. 
Next time shave along the grains (direction of your pubic hair). He mindful not to bruise your skin. Apply water or toilet soap to reduce friction.
2177 2018-10-08 19:55:19 The top buyer of U.S. soybeans in August 2018 was Iran.@ToddHultman1 .......soybeans for oil with China .....strange grain flows continue~tariffs can do that
2178 2018-10-08 19:55:17 What they recycle used oil in Scotland? Hey! My used oil is always put in jars before trashing it. Can we send it to the factory instead? @Channel4 #recyclingoil

2183 2018-10-08 19:54:40 Trump demanding ransom from Saudia Arabia in the open. Well, what if they don't need US Military? What if they start pricing their oil in another currency than usd? What if US loses complete control of OPEC through the loss of S. Arabia? Is US ready to pay the price?
2184 2018-10-08 19:54:39 Move
2185 2018-10-08 19:54:35 What should we do ? Can we tax our way out ? Raise gas prices and heating oil prices ? Make the middle class pay more for everything ? Oh, let me guess, punish the rich. How else ?
2186 2018-10-08 19:54:27 Ya he reminded me a lot like my little brother. Always trying to get involved with things, being annoying but not on purpose, and completely ignoring what you ask. But also loving him once you realise he isn't always gonna be around. Oh welp
2187 2018-10-08 19:54:20 who cares about al gore? what about the koch brothers? net worth in the billions with their efforts to deny global warming & exacerbate it via their dirty businesses in oil & gas, including Alberta tarsands? but yeah tell us more about al gore while our environment goes to 
2188 2018-10-08 19:54:16 We endeavored to do our best to warn everyone that .@realDonaldTrump was a snake oil salesperson and a fraud. Sadly, they didn’t listen.
2189 2018-10-08 19:54:04 That strategy works in Oklahoma or Texas where most oil co.s are independents and favour conservative policies. But the oil sands co.s? Support for carbon pricing, oil sands emissions cap, methane emission reductions, etc. is bleeding edge in the heavy oil biz.
2190 2018-10-08 19:54:03 For real .
2191 2018-10-08 19:53:51 You have chosen snake oil over reason. You've also chosen to no longer be a part of my life. I said good day!

2205 2018-10-08 19:52:21 Yeah let's blame already marginalized people, not megacorps for destroying the planet.  I'm sure that'll be productive. 

"We gotta stop using straws!" meanwhile millions of pounds of fishing nets, industrial waste and crude oil spills literally choke the ocean to death
2206 2018-10-08 19:52:09 I only wash my hair once a week every week, so whatever works! My hair is very thick and coarse and sucks up all the oil so it works lol
2207 2018-10-08 19:52:07 Actually the oil was discovered 1960's, the technology needed brought it up in 1970's . All those pictures are Scotland under the Union, when Scotland became an oil rich nation, its was hidden from us by WM under the McCrone Report for 30 years.  WM stole Scotlands future........
2208 2018-10-08 19:52:07 That, and in West TEXAS (Permian Basin) we are producing so much oil & natural gas that the pipelines we have now are completely full. We are making new ones now but we have to transport it through rail & road.
2209 2018-10-08 19:52:01 That time of the year where my skin feels dehydrated & tight afff bring on the facial oil
2210 2018-10-08 19:51:45 This is what it’s come to: most big oil companies have realized that bold action is necessary to address climate change. Yet, conservative politicians are sticking their heads in the sand more firmly than ever.
2211 2018-10-08 19:51:40 There are alternatives to oil based plastics that look the same! They’re just more expensive and companies are too cheap to implement them
2212 2018-10-08 19:51:29 You: we we're drilling for clean oil. If we had a spill, it wouldn't matter because it was clean.

2216 2018-10-08 19:50:49 Thank you  honestly took me a really long time to get the hang of oil paints! Just took a lot of practice 
2217 2018-10-08 19:50:47 Higher petrol prices are a perfect signal that we need to ditch our oil addiction. We can do this.   
2218 2018-10-08 19:50:45 Saan k bili ng oil?

2222 2018-10-08 19:50:26 I got the best oil boys who tell me that this is a Yuge hoax. We need more coal and more oil.
2223 2018-10-08 19:50:25 More dangerous and less efficient, more carbon is emitted by train engines than pumping stations. Pipelines waste less oil (fewer spills) and cost less to transport (lower carbon emissions) and those things combine to make  them cheaper. Free Market is always the answer.
2224 2018-10-08 19:50:23 Saan m nbili oil mo?

2266 2018-10-08 19:45:46 The sad thing is that we all know that they'll completely ignore it and do absolutely nothing, because they're full of self-serving imbeciles who are stupid enough to "not believe" science and/or are being bribed by the oil industry to ignore this.
2267 2018-10-08 19:45:37 Bravo! That's what everyone seems to be conveniently forgetting, that we're on the cusp of climatic disaster unless we act decisively now!
 
Or PM had shown real leadership by banning oil and gas exploration and standing firm on petrol excise.
2268 2018-10-08 19:45:35 @seanhannity how many drops of oil have come out of Anwar? oh, that's right.....NONE! tax cuts with massive new spending, invisible (non-existent) border wall, troops overseas that aren't winning or coming home.....tell the whole truth, or u  r involved in fake news

2277 2018-10-08 19:44:39 Fry them up in vegetable oil. No breading or anything. Just toss them in until they're golden crispy on the outside. 

The sauce: Mix butter, white vinegar, and soy sauce in a small pot and add the Franks after t hey're all mixed into a hot liquid. (1/2)
2278 2018-10-08 19:44:33 LOL, the dude is a snake oil salesman. His clients are literally the dumbest human beings in the universe. Praying on the week, he will get his.
2279 2018-10-08 19:44:24 This country falls farther and farther behind on renewable energy, and the oil and gas industry couldn’t be happier! 
Imagine what an economic driver implementing green energy c/b in every state - how many jobs it could generate. California has, and business is booming.
2280 2018-10-08 19:44:20 Ay stop trying to brainwash the youth into thinking you’re an actual human being, you malfunctioning oil pump with legs
2281 2018-10-08 19:44:15 Historically when the press and people start talking major spikes in oil. A short term sell off. Is in the future

2289 2018-10-08 19:43:46 Canada with its tiny population wants to show the world how to lead with silly gestures like Alberta banning coal mines & no pipelines. US increases coal production as did BC for export. Ont & Que import tanker oil from Saudi Sheiks & Venezuela’s Killer Dictator. Dream on Greens
2290 2018-10-08 19:43:43 Love how everyone has suddenly become an economic expert in the country. Saudis had all their oil money to take care of them. 
Don't know anything about economy? Don't speak about it. Rest easy and let the people you elected make the decisions
2291 2018-10-08 19:43:42 @realDonaldTrump A lot of cars and lawn equipment will NOT run on gas blends with more than 10% ethanol. If we produce so much oil why are ur prices of gas going up? We do NOT keep all our own oil,do we? High gas prices are a tax on consumers. Get it sir +other prices go up too
2292 2018-10-08 19:43:12 Will you be asking us how we get by without #DDT and #AgentOrange those other brilliant #Monsanto products? And how did we ever survive banning lead in petrol which the oil industry swore was indispensable? And wait...CFCs. Weren’t they essential? And tobacco? Essential ... not.
2293 2018-10-08 19:43:04 I wonder what these folks will think when tariffs raise the price of everything at Dollar General and oil his $100 plus/barrel next year.

2302 2018-10-08 19:42:06 MBS "reform" bs + "does it add anything?" =  it didn't ... bc it wasn't covered

"useful to elites"

2307 2018-10-08 19:41:35 PTI always left IMF as an option. 
When it promised to keep Oil and Gas prices low, oil was $50 a barrel. It is now $78. 
You need to check CIRCULAR DEBT.

2325 2018-10-08 19:39:41 Looks a very interesting book. As a lover of mustard (i.e. among those who buy the oil that is sold as a cosmetic product, for cooking) I am not put off!
2326 2018-10-08 19:39:32 Girl some people pay like 70 for oil changes and their cars aren’t foreign. Be BLESSEDT lol
2327 2018-10-08 19:39:28 Last night raccoons retrieved a bottle of olive oil from the cabinet under my barbecue, unscrewed the top and either slugged that stuff down all night or, to gauge by the stains on my deck, had a big Greco-Roman wrestling tournament. #yyz
2328 2018-10-08 19:39:27 you are to blame for this for pushing wars for oil instead of steering us to better fuel alternatives. you sociopath
2329 2018-10-08 19:39:27 Satan will only leave you alone if he’s got you bewitched, living in your soul. But if you go after hell with fresh oil from your belly everyday is WWIII.
2330 2018-10-08 19:39:18 Make sure it's a full spectrum CBD oil, like what we use to make our vapes and rubs!
2331 2018-10-08 19:39:06 You reckon cost of importing soya bean bean crude oil is the same as that of importing the soya beans
2332 2018-10-08 19:39:03  it’s the type of oil I get. I drive a lot so I don’t do regular oil.
2333 2018-10-08 19:38:59 Best thing in the world to my knowledge. We always keep some essential oil of lavender in the kitchen in case of burns. I used to sell it..
2334 2018-10-08 19:38:57 L'OGSU-SJ et Irving Oil ont informé les médias relativement à l'intervention à la raffinerie. Le site a été isolé et la situation est stable. L'accent a été mis sur la sécurité du public, des employés et de tous les intervenants.
2335 2018-10-08 19:38:35 When I lived in Oxford, I used to get my oil changed at a place on Jackson. Late one day after visiting the shop, I got a text from an employee who found my number in their computer; he told me how beautiful I looked that day. I bet he also had my plate number and address. 
2336 2018-10-08 19:38:20 I could probably fill at least 10 deep fryers with the amount of oil that comes off my hair daily, like seriously wtf why do I produce oil this fast

2340 2018-10-08 19:38:08 Expanding conservative hate to China, trade war with China, then China won't buy oil from USA, then Putin sells all his oil to China, most American oil companies back Republicans, they're played, before too late, get Trump out of Republican. Hope Republicans come here to read.
2341 2018-10-08 19:38:01 DeMaio says repealing Prop 6 will immediately put money back in the pockets of CA drivers, but again... not true. Let’s debunk this #DeMaioDoozie - his proposition doesn’t guarantee oil companies or retailers will drop taxes. Is he really protecting CA drivers? Nope.

2344 2018-10-08 19:37:30 You are allowing oil sands emissions to *increase* to 100Mt by 2030.  With a crisis a decade later.  Your government *bought* a pipeline to facilitate growth in emissions.  Stop playing games with our children's future.
2345 2018-10-08 19:37:13 oil painting more like anger and hatred
2346 2018-10-08 19:37:03 I had to restore my wok with salt and oil. And it worked! No more rust. So I took my new skill to restoring my cast iron pan. It’s seasoning in the oven as we tweet!
2347 2018-10-08 19:37:03 I'm siding with the Alberta oil sands companies. They've figured out how to thrive in a carbon-constrained future and we should do everything we can to ensure they remain competitive as global climate policy becomes ever more aggressive.
2348 2018-10-08 19:36:57 I find it difficult to understand why, oil companies can produce 24/7 electricity for host communities but our state government cannot use the same method and/or harness the natural resources we have ( water, gas, sunlight) to provide adequate electricity for the state.

2359 2018-10-08 19:36:05 try rubbing some lavender essential oil on your temples before bed or if that’s too hard to come across, your local publix/Walmart should sell it loosely. I used to put some in a sock under my pillow and it ALWAYS worked for me. hope this helps!
2360 2018-10-08 19:36:03 It is. Website states nothing about origin of food which annoys me. Also peanut butter with palm oil? A health focused company that doesn’t care about palm oil or reheating food in plastic containers...

2371 2018-10-08 19:34:20 Oregano works wonders. BUT it's naturally a hot oil, So dilute a small amount on a QTip, and apply twice a day. Adding melaleuca or frankincense wouldn't hurt either. Be sure you're using a quality brand!

2396 2018-10-08 19:30:31 ..on our own. We have the capacity to export in the long run as well. What we need is efficient management of that sector. Because it's ridden with too many moving parts and subsistencies. 
In terms of diversification, Agriculture presents as the next best alternative to oil.

2400 2018-10-08 19:30:17 What kind of oil & gas?
2401 2018-10-08 19:30:00 I could better understand the opposition to the pipeline if Alberta was the only ones to benefit from it but as all of Canada will benefit we can only assume the opposition isn’t anti oil but anti Alberta.
2402 2018-10-08 19:29:56 Le saviez vous ? En cosmétique (souvent dans les gel douche) si vous regardez les ingrédients vous devriez trouver "castor oil ". Rassurez-vous le petit animal du même nom n'est pas en danger, il s'agit d'huile de Ricin. C'est une mauvaise traduction anglaise de cette plante.
2403 2018-10-08 19:29:54 Who wants to draw my sona smashing up the corporate headquarters for some big oil company
2404 2018-10-08 19:29:49 "Oil pulls back on news US may allow wiggle room on sanctions."

Do sanctions really even do anything?  Sure Iran may be selling less oil directly but what they are selling is at much higher prices and when sanctions are lifted or they find a way around, they make higher profit.
2405 2018-10-08 19:29:46 The Mixed Chicks Coil, Kink, and Curl styling creme mixed w/ a little bit of jojoba oil works well
2406 2018-10-08 19:29:38 Agreed, they are not running the economy very well. However, Dar sb was also not very competent. He had the opportunity to increase the tax net but was busy increasing the indirect taxes. Lowest oil prices for 3 years and @pmln_org was unable to restructure our economy.
2407 2018-10-08 19:29:33 How are your constant increasing taxes and banning oil and natural gas exploration helping this situation @jacindaardern
2408 2018-10-08 19:29:25 I sometimes forget how damn tasty oven roasted vegetables.  Last night I had some squash and broccoli roasted in olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and some mustard powder.  So damn GOOD and healthy too!
2409 2018-10-08 19:29:19 You need some coconut oil for them hands. Take some of that cash and treat yourself - heck get yourself a manicure.
2410 2018-10-08 19:29:14 Snake oil salesman. 
2411 2018-10-08 19:29:09 Shame on you Subaru.  Impreza sport with 21k has had the oil light on 5 times.  @subaru_usa  calls this normal.  Came up with a $2k "incentive" package for trade... Problem is the dealer doesn't want this car on his lot so he lowballed the buyout offer. #lostAloyalcustomer
2412 2018-10-08 19:29:08 And the Koch brothers and oil companies.
2413 2018-10-08 19:29:00 Hi, Ann. I was a Navy Corpsman. I couldn't serve under this traitor. In my opinion, OEF/OIF has been a pretty bad war.  More Saudis on the planes than Iragis or Afghanis. But, you know... Oil.

2415 2018-10-08 19:28:44 Sir... i think  previous Thug govt left no other choice for us. Saudis are reluctant to give us oil on credit. China have his own interests, they can invest but will not give us billions. So how pak economy will sustain?  This nation will die if will not use imported items.
2416 2018-10-08 19:28:33 Get in touch with us for oil change services, AC repairs, and more.
2417 2018-10-08 19:28:30 3. Shop dealer incentives.
If you’re at 2 Toyota dealerships in town then of course they’re giving you the same rate for the same car, & they match competitor’s price?
What is the dealership perks? I’d pay $500 more for a car from a dealer that had, say, free oil changes for life
2418 2018-10-08 19:28:20 It's super great.  I carry white flower oil with me everywhere.  It's even helpful in summer when rubbed on the forehead and temples to help cool you down.  
On the neck and chest it helps with congestion.  Great all around oil.
2419 2018-10-08 19:28:17 "For example, the CIA engineered the coup that overthrew the democratically elected Mosaddeq government in Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah of Iran, who gave the oil contracts to US companies."
Harvey, David. Brief History of Neoliberalism, A, Oxford University Press, 2005.
2420 2018-10-08 19:28:06 Ahh thank you. I am really interested in some long-term otm CL puts, as EEM growth and rate tightening plus Iran oil probably continuing to make it to market combined with the shale producers having to pump. Are you seeing something different or looking at that trade?
2421 2018-10-08 19:28:04 Coconut oil.
2422 2018-10-08 19:28:01 I’ve gone from using four drops of UFO oil every day to two drops every other day 
2423 2018-10-08 19:28:01 Moisturizing is a very important part of fighting acne. Avoid moisturizers that contain petrolatum, comedogenic oils such as coconut oil, mineral oil, and alcohol. #skincaretips #beauty
2424 2018-10-08 19:27:57 The oil belonging to the islands who were pushing to be classified as a British overseas territory if Scotland did become independent, no less....
2425 2018-10-08 19:27:57 @ChristianFraser @KattyKayBBC  I wish other people could see - but the plan is . Let successive western governments drip feed money in to nuclear fusion research over the next 100 ish years. Then when scientists have ‘cracked’ it. Sell the idea cheap to the oil / gas companies.
2426 2018-10-08 19:27:47 thank you so much!!! i owe it all to castor oil
2427 2018-10-08 19:27:31 I hear the Boy Scouts hate you. Future cops. You might as well dig out your da's snake oil wagon. Doesn't matter who you pander to we will #rememberinNovember
2428 2018-10-08 19:27:27 Will? It has nothing to do with will.............they're in the oil industry's pocket or they're involved in the oil industry themselves............it's about GREED!

2430 2018-10-08 19:27:19 I believe they call that "Checking the Oil".
2431 2018-10-08 19:27:18 If we don’t want to pay $5 billion a year to oil companies for transport energy, then let’s have a strategy for a rapid transition off oil - safe cycling and walking, electric cars/buses/trucks/trains/cycles. Cuts climate emissions too #WINWIN

2434 2018-10-08 19:27:07 Uhh, so the 2.25 billion gal in small refiner exemptions for 2016 & 2017, which led to 75% reduction in RIN price, is not considered a “win” for the oil industry? And E15 waiver lowers RIN prices even further, so sheesh, what more do they want?
2435 2018-10-08 19:27:07 I wear mine down the first day after I wash it, but my 'off' day, it's up in a ponytail, lol. My mother has curly hair so it's dryer. I did find that IRONICALLY using Argan oil in my hair when I wash it makes it stay notoily for longer. Same happens with oil-cleanser for my face!

2442 2018-10-08 19:26:34 I don’t understand people who put butter/coconut oil in their coffee like there are easier ways to shit yourself
2443 2018-10-08 19:26:33 Kurdistan has roughly one-third of Iraq’s total oil reserves? How?
2444 2018-10-08 19:26:27 yes and we are just getting started.. but everyone needs to pay attention because this is what the left does.. projects their own bigotry and sets separate rules depending on your views and then if they dont have anything will just flat out make it up. its mob rule pure n simple
2445 2018-10-08 19:26:25 Probably not cut out for water skiing either.  Oil painting is probably a better idea. Or maybe just watching the sky.
2446 2018-10-08 19:26:23 Are you nuts? Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world. Just no intellect capital.
2447 2018-10-08 19:26:16 I can't imagine how that might have effected the olive oil business.
2448 2018-10-08 19:26:10 Not feeling useless: got the snow-blower fired up again for the season, thank Bog in Heaven. Took some soft touch of fresh fuel, two-weight oil, soft priming, then let it set for a time. Fired up fast. SHITLOADS of exhaust smoke.
2449 2018-10-08 19:26:06 I was in Oklahoma last summer and people said oil and gas industry is all we got. They said we can’t eat sand. We who wsnt to change to clean energy need to address these peoples needs as well as talk about climate change.

2454 2018-10-08 19:25:34 This is a boy crying wolf problem.
70s - Overpopulation would lead to mass starvation.
80s - We'll run out of oil in 10 years.
90s - The hole in the ozone will cause us to burn to a crisp after the acid rain has already killed us all.
2010 - polar ice caps will be gone.
Etc.
2455 2018-10-08 19:25:29 Please who knows Eucalyptus oil in Hausa or Arabic and where it can be found?

2458 2018-10-08 19:25:18 I know, because obviously you don't know that BP Claire, Lancaster and all the others discovered since 2010 will yield well over the next 50 years. Scottish oil and gas is the only thing that pegs UK currency. Once London lose that, then see what happens to UK. #indyref2

2466 2018-10-08 19:24:31 They happen from oil and gas fracking.
2467 2018-10-08 19:24:30 i'd say so, especially since you can basically put anything into peanut butter and it comes out good. i wanna make some with chili oil in it, yum.
2468 2018-10-08 19:24:25 How long before there is talk of oil on the track?
2469 2018-10-08 19:24:12 We’ve already been promised a fast-track. Think about that Paul.

2477 2018-10-08 19:23:13 I read an article on the oil and the problem is it may not contain as much of the ingredient as it says or it may contain a lot more. It looked like there wasn't enough regulation to check it. There's also no evidence it helps as far as I know. Seems to be a lot of hype.

2502 2018-10-08 19:21:16 Master stroke by Modiji ! India will pay for oil to Iran with rice from Nov onwards. We important abt 16% of our requirements from Iran. To that extent, pressure on rupee will be less. If we get the solar buses n trucks in large nos on credit, a huge relief to the Rupee !
2503 2018-10-08 19:21:15 What if oil holds at $100 a barrel, would that be a fair valuation?
2504 2018-10-08 19:21:14 Oil sands operators pay taxes and royalties, employ Canadian companies and contribute to our economies.

2520 2018-10-08 19:19:21 I am voting yes on 112. The Oil and Gas industry is getting too greedy. They will keep getting millions of dollars every year even with the 2500 foot setback. They are acting like spoiled brats.

2530 2018-10-08 19:18:12 @ScotlandTonight Sturgeon was told at the Aberdeen International Oil Exhibition in 2014, before the vote, that oil price would fall to $60. She ignored it.  It fell - much further.

2532 2018-10-08 19:17:52 This is kind of worthless to say, but how I wish President Carter wasn't laughed at and scorned when he wanted to move to new technology and away from oil. Imagine where we would be now! Such a shame.

2551 2018-10-08 19:16:09 It is actually SERVICE STATION.

2560 2018-10-08 19:15:07 Not fully agree with Ind's decision to continue buying Iranian oil against the backdrop of looming sanctions. Ind has interests in which US can help a lot, runs a trade surplus, has access to key tech, support of heavyweight in all arenas. Don't zero out imports. Perhaps reduce?
2561 2018-10-08 19:14:57 @davidshukmanbbc isn’t it inevitable that all the oil and gas reserves around the world will still be used until they run out by countries with massive over indulgent populations with lower morals?
2562 2018-10-08 19:14:56 True story my friend and I were taking her care to get the oil change. Her car broke down on our way back. Police officers helped push the care off the road. When my friend started having a hard time breath the called the ambulance. They made sure I got home safely

2567 2018-10-08 19:14:42 I don’t measure the quantites as I go, but here us an approximate: About 1/3 cup sugar, a few teaspoonfuls of hershey’s powdered cocoa, a dash of salt, a splash of vanilla, 1 egg, about a tablespoon of canola oil, and about 1/4 cup flower.

2576 2018-10-08 19:14:10 Again, you're still trying to absolve the leaders of their gross failings. Literally almost every African country has experienced commodity export booms from their biggest commodity (Oil, cocoa, gold etc), what have they done with the windfall from the exports? Steal of course.
2577 2018-10-08 19:14:10 We make all our own electrons, and have capacity to make many more, renewably... need ambitious policies to kick the oil habit faster. Such a waste sending billions overseas every year for oil....

2582 2018-10-08 19:13:46 I won’t but the Dems need to make a serious commitment to ending fossil fuels. No more of this bridge fuel BS for Fracked gas. The Dems need to be the environmental party. No money from gas or oil companies.

2601 2018-10-08 19:12:25 I’d bleach it again (as long as your hair doesn’t feel bad), let it sit until it’s pale yellow and then try the blue again.

2664 2018-10-08 19:06:56 Friends who use essential oils.... best oil to put on a wart? Pretty sure that's what it is. I've had it forever and gregory recently discovered it and always pokes at it  now it's bigger 
2665 2018-10-08 19:06:53 @SaigeDragon I got a poem for you!!!!
U....G.....L....Y!!!! You ain’t got no alibi you ugly. Also your oil painting looks like the one I made my freshmen year in intro to art. I got a C for it lmao. Don’t criticize someone’s work when you fail to excel at your
2666 2018-10-08 19:06:49 Gee! Do you think oil refineries and the oil industry is maybe kind of dangerous? I'm sure solar and wind farms explode all the time, right?

.......right?

Well, at least our government has stopped investing in oil, right?

Oh, wait!
2667 2018-10-08 19:06:40 But pls hold on to Buhari’s influences in the oil price as a gain of democracy. Meanwhile Nigerians will be paying 76billion dollars in debt, for more than 4trn of GEJ.
2668 2018-10-08 19:06:40 If you want to support terrorism and betray the oppressed people, you will face freedom of expression. Your government has promised and must end the work of the Iranian regime's damaging oil by November 4th. The work of this monster of terrorism must end, everyone is tired
2669 2018-10-08 19:06:38 So good for that.  I used to use the tiger balm, but I prefer the more liquid, less oily white flower oil.   But I do have the red and white tiger balm!
2670 2018-10-08 19:06:35 Buhari has allegations against him. $2:8B oil money disappeared in 1979. PTF contract inflation. OBJ has been his Savior. He can't touch him

2672 2018-10-08 19:06:09 They produce crude oil from soya beans and then refine it on site and after refining they bottle it. They can also start the process with crude oil rather than raw soya beans. No scam here.

Reporter says:
2kg sugar $5
375ml oil $3
A man says look at this bottle of beer I'm drinking. I used to buy it for a dollar now it's $1.50
2677 2018-10-08 19:05:57 I got hit last Monday (still have not taken my car in) and now today I go to get my oil changed and my hood wont open
2678 2018-10-08 19:05:55 "hey tom cruise can you just oil up for me and grab that dudes ass for a bit?" 
"i mean ig uess"
2679 2018-10-08 19:05:46 tbh i love using my powerfleet but since i'm just farming 3-4 i should probably make it cheaper but i have 22k oil so i mean
2680 2018-10-08 19:05:26 Cbd oil is legal now. But Lydia's mother begged the republican controlled state to make changes so she could be saved. But being uneducated Walker Sat by for months and signed the bill after it was too late. Sad stuff.
2681 2018-10-08 19:04:59 I love skittles but won’t be buying them for myself or to hand out for Halloween until you stick to pledges re: responsible palm oil!!! FYI.

2683 2018-10-08 19:04:37 O ffs just go ahead and drill for oil in the bodies of baby bear cubs and build a pipeline out of lead through a native american burial ground until it empties into fragile wetlands near a reservoir for drinking water
zinke is worse than pruitt
2684 2018-10-08 19:04:29 You certainly could, but you still wouldn't get the oil out that white dress :-)
2685 2018-10-08 19:04:22 You know, I should invest in changing my own oil.
2686 2018-10-08 19:04:19 @ChristianFraser @KattyKayBBC It’s laughable !!!
Multinational petrochemical companies have exploitable reserves of oil / gas / shale gas for the next 2 hundred years minimum. Why would they give that up ?!?! .........

2688 2018-10-08 19:04:15 Update on injured following refinery blast. 4 with non life threatening injuries. Both SJ Mayor Don Darling and Kevin  Scott of Irving Oil say this being Thanksgiving weekend, they are very grateful no one was seriously injured @Global_NB
2689 2018-10-08 19:04:14 You don't think Calgary benefited from '88?  The facilities, the migration to Calgary... the huge growth from then until 2014 was not only due to oil.
2690 2018-10-08 19:04:12 After committing such heinous crimes against humanity what kind of food & oil other then Rockets & Bombs #SaudiArab can deliver to thousands of #Yemeni dead & wounded people majority of them being women & Children & Hunreds of thousands killed by starvation or due to no medicins?
2691 2018-10-08 19:04:09 She could’ve got this off of her chest ages ago. Didn’t have to wait to add oil to the fire. Seems opportunistic to say the least. At least make sure you get both sides of the story. Surely your “blue tick” allows for that? #NotAllMen

2694 2018-10-08 19:03:38 Do you think these oil companies pay tax to Bayelsa?
2695 2018-10-08 19:03:29 $3 billion a year in various tax credits, deductions and grants to oil companies, $12 billion in EDC subsidies since the Liberals took office...and you bought a 65 year old pipeline for $4.5 billion. What game are you playing?
2696 2018-10-08 19:03:27 what kind of beauty oils do you guys use? argan oil irritates my skin

2702 2018-10-08 19:02:54 I’m sad to find out that the main ingredient in Clinique’s Take the Day Off is Palm Oil  I got a sample of it & love it but I refuse to purchase a full size & contribute to deforestation & habitat destruction where SO many threatened/endangered animals live, like Orangutans.
2703 2018-10-08 19:02:52 I can't understand why these things are happening? On Oil price our Finance Min give clarification, on Rupee our Rly Min give comments, on Defence our IT Min give explanations, Defence Min comments on Law & Order. They should have interchange their Ministry by showing own intrest

2705 2018-10-08 19:02:45 Legitimate question: how the hell did I get glitter on me at work?!? I have NOTHING glittery on, shrug freshly washed and no makeup only my essential oil i wear. I'm working my nurse job... and NOT in MYC.
2706 2018-10-08 19:02:44 Bueno pues habléme sobre del Zama-1, sobre Sierra Oil & Gas, y las rondas 1.1 y 1.4. Contraste porqué México debería de renunciar a su riqueza de petróleo y sus derivados.
2707 2018-10-08 19:02:41 This is mere PR there is no Pure Drop in Shops , there is no cooking oil, even Lafarge and PPC said that 2 weeks ago but Cement is now selling $28
2708 2018-10-08 19:02:41 Wish the conversation was less about green cars, oil and others and more about human dietary behaviors. Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emission - way more than transportation.
2709 2018-10-08 19:02:40 I’m using r&b from lush and some oils I have around the house rn — I switch up cuz my hair likes different products depending on the season. The cooler months call for more oil based products, in the summer is when I’ll use curl creams cut with a little water for volume.
2710 2018-10-08 19:02:28 Cool! Come and take my car for an Oil change, Tire Rotation, and a car wash would be nice too. Thanks! <3
2711 2018-10-08 19:02:18 I wish somebody else could take my car to get a oil change
2712 2018-10-08 19:02:15 It stings my eyes... The Tata oil cleanser is super thorough and doesn't hurt my eyes.
2713 2018-10-08 19:02:10 These oil pens do justice
2714 2018-10-08 19:02:03 So where at the cops, whee is your tax money going?
2715 2018-10-08 19:01:59 When the gov’t and your political party is pushing a pipeline and oil tankers down our throat are we really to take you seriously? Give your head a shake @BobRae48 !
2716 2018-10-08 19:01:44 We do need taxes to pay for much needed infrastructure & we do need to curb our dependence on fossil fuels....if we don’t divest from oil we will all be ‘bulldusted’! So much to do in terms of climate change, so little time!
2717 2018-10-08 19:01:40 I wouldn’t expect much. Like I said, I think Ben is a snake oil salesman. He’s not a Milo but he’s in the same class as those types to me.
2718 2018-10-08 19:01:37 You call bayelsa oil producing, i will however ask you a question.
2719 2018-10-08 19:01:26 @POTUS Why am I paying so much for oil and gas? $3.00 a gallon for oil and $2.80 for a gallon of gas. We need to win this battle now sir!! Winter is coming and it’s too much to heat a home! Can you help with this now? You know because you “win” everything else for us!God Bless!
2720 2018-10-08 19:01:08 Dad: hey you need to learn how to change your own oil

2729 2018-10-08 19:00:30 Peeled, cut lengthwise into fourths, then boiled in salted water until fork tender, drained and served with a generous drizzle of olive, avocado or any other nut oil makes it absolutely scrumptious and super healthy.

2742 2018-10-08 18:59:48 Futile lachrymation once the planets atmosphere pushes back on the consumption of almost a 100 million barrels of oil per day to fill the pockets of a HEGEMONIC OLIGARCHY who kill for oil so that the oil consuming world can commit environmental suicide
2743 2018-10-08 18:59:39 Majority of oil producing states of this federation are owing salaries while almost all northern states have paid up to date..
Do you see why their people trust them more?

You know that in ep 6 in DHMIS the lamp sings that the yellow guy "dreams" that he is drowning in oil. 
Not that IRL is drowning in oil but just in a dream.

PS. Love your videos have seen them all multiple times
2746 2018-10-08 18:59:26 I saw it! it was heartbreaking I lived near Wind River Rez in Jackson WY for many years till I moved back home to MT- to this day there are murders/abuse/disappearances  of NA women left unsolved w/o justice for families.

2749 2018-10-08 18:59:05 Yes the glaciers melting is awful. Polar bears dying. Suddenly breaking off can cause tidal waves and earthquakes. “Fingerprints of the Gods” discusses that. How are the fish? Polluted, if more oil and shipping. Alaska is gorgeous and should remain as pristine as possible.
2750 2018-10-08 18:58:44 @lesterglenn56 DO you have a date for the opening of Freehold? I have a Colorado from Pine Belt. I need an oil change and the earliest appt they can give me is a month away.
2751 2018-10-08 18:58:44 I got off work & my oil change sensor came on so I came to get an oil change & then while I’m waiting on it, I find out my battery is dead lollll welcome to being an adult I guess 
2752 2018-10-08 18:58:42 Hmmm. Houston. Oil rig museum and space museum. This might work. #spacevikings
2753 2018-10-08 18:58:33 Loaded up on some bounce candidates - mostly oversold techs and some oil, we'll see how it goes..
2754 2018-10-08 18:58:32 and you're right about it being way more about money than climate for those who are active climate change deniers, given that they are invariably tied to right-wing think tanks, the oil lobby, the anti-renewable lobby, or any combination thereof.

2761 2018-10-08 18:57:36 Haha, i would trade you the oil rig museum everytime for 6.5 hours in a car hearing "see that cotton field, used to be a store there.  Dont recall the name, but there was a store."
2762 2018-10-08 18:57:35 Stock motors normally aren't impressive, just reliable. Would put money it would do a million miles if you keep the oil changed. Gave me motivation to degrease her though. Thanks lol

2768 2018-10-08 18:57:07 Thanks for the reply @esmewren but isn't that missing the point? You're giving him a platform that he will twist to suit his narrative. He's unlikely to come on & say US policy is driven solely to protect the oil tycoons as any cost so will revert to calling the #ipcc #FakeNews.
2769 2018-10-08 18:57:06 Live on an island isolated in the ocean. Shut down offshore oil and gas exploration. Tax fuel at over 50%. Then scratch your head as to why petrol is expensive and blame the petrol retailers!? Genius she is not.

2783 2018-10-08 18:55:01 Focus on fats found in olives, olive oil, avocados, almonds, & other nuts, monosaturated fats can help normalize cholesterol & inflammation.

It started thundering and raining outside so I thought I'd just watch TV, but the rain is keeping me from catching anything.  What a great Monday! 
2798 2018-10-08 18:53:37 I hate getting my oil changed because I’m scared I’m not gonna pull in just right and my tire is gonna fall through the middle part. 
2799 2018-10-08 18:53:35 Lavender oil does that, it also makes you more likely to forget
2800 2018-10-08 18:53:35 Just like the war on drugs. It's completely fabricated. 

Except with "terror," the USA is creating more terrorists by continuing to kill people for oil.

Wake up, @jaketapper! Oppose war!
2801 2018-10-08 18:53:26 Nooooooooooo sweetheart please don't... Buy a @dermatologica non oil face cream please go to clicks or sorbet if I was close by I'd give you some
2802 2018-10-08 18:53:22 There's loads of testimonials of people who've said cannabis oil cured their cancer when they didn't make any/many other diet/lifestyle changes.
2803 2018-10-08 18:53:15 getting an oil change is so inconvenient
2804 2018-10-08 18:53:09 Sounds good to me. The faster the #Phillies move away from Captain Coconut Oil and the Gabermetrics era, the better!
2805 2018-10-08 18:53:05 Petty reasoning. Is turkana oil the residents urine?
2806 2018-10-08 18:52:55 With 80-100$ oil and with a better GCC diplomacy the valuation of #SaudiAramco of over 2 Trlm$ become more and more probable and possible | #ksa @Khalid_AlFalih

2808 2018-10-08 18:52:39 Do you use gasoline?  Oil?  Plastic...like your keyboard?  Then you demand more oil.  Don't be a hypocrite.  Blaming one company for the climate of the entire planet is the very definition of insanity--the Democrat specialty.

2809 2018-10-08 18:52:39 Confused by no alternatives? 
Worldwide solar capacity increased by 30% last year.  India, China, KSA leading the way. Alternative to oil or coal in huge (population) growth countries. 
Not all oil has to be replaced, not all GHG are from oil.
2810 2018-10-08 18:52:38 Just because BPCL doesn't have any loan or interest payable means not all oil companies are free of same. Don't generalise your opinion on specific case. The RTI should have made to Petroleum ministry.
2811 2018-10-08 18:52:34 Really pleased to see so many conversations about climate change breaking into the mainstream. Over the last year, millions of people - including myself - have seen the signs, read the reports, and arrived at radical conclusions. Big oil better watch out. A revolution is coming.

2813 2018-10-08 18:52:24 The question is why Oil price has increased while crude inventory has increased recently I think investor believe oil shock is coming soon.
2814 2018-10-08 18:52:18 It never ends. $300 to fix my car’s fuel line, turn rotors, fix broken wires to oxygen sensor and oil change. Luckily I take it to an honest shop or they would have charged me $190 to replace oxygen sensor too. #cantwinforlosing
2815 2018-10-08 18:52:17 What about the elderly living alone when they decide to up the price of coal and oil. Electricity will rise along with that. The cost of living keeps going up along with taxes. Nothing comes down.

2825 2018-10-08 18:51:27 Venezuela hit the crisis based on pegging everything on oil prices. They defaulted on their debt. Had devalue their currency to be able to deal with it. Thereafter couldn’t reborrow and hence the crisis. Nothing to do with communism. Anyone not diversifying portfolios it happens

2830 2018-10-08 18:50:41 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @CourtReagan But there are also views out there that with #shale #oil high 1st year depletion rate, like 80%, you are now/soon be moving to less productive wells. Also meant rig count needs to increase just to keep up with current production rate. #wti
2831 2018-10-08 18:50:30 Modern day Snake Oil, good for anything that ales you, Pay now, I am out of town Tomorrow.
2832 2018-10-08 18:50:27 The category "alimentary oil" is not limited to olive oil (I'm not sure it even includes it). The fact the oil shows the lowest inflation can be explained by the simple fact that it is subsidized. Dried fruits are imported. Their prices are affected by currency depreciation.
2833 2018-10-08 18:50:23 Even if they were to crush 100% soya, we no longer have the supporting downstream cattle farming and poultry to consume the oil extracted soya. That's why you see all that hip, ideally it should be processed to feed. So companies prefer to import unrefined oil
2834 2018-10-08 18:50:21 How bout ditch all your seed/vegetable oil first?
2835 2018-10-08 18:50:20 Rub castor oil every night and you should be good!

2837 2018-10-08 18:50:02 I Wonder how everyone will feel about offshore oil drilling once gas prices hit $5 a gallon... Offshore oil drilling must be done!!! We need to fully rely on ourselves when it comes to oil. We cannot allow OPEC countries to control the oil market!
2838 2018-10-08 18:50:00 I need my oil hanged too lol
2839 2018-10-08 18:49:55 Oil prices have gone up generally but our govt in its wisdom decided to add more pain by adding a tax of 100 shillings instead of the reducing the current 1200 it's already charging
2840 2018-10-08 18:49:54 Had never listened to the first self-titled Midnight Oil album from '78. Not bad. Always interesting to hear a band with such a definitive sound feeling their way toward it early on.

2855 2018-10-08 18:48:15 I don’t see that the Bible should hold the answer to anything, in regards it was written by priests at a time when oil was used only in lamps and the earth’s total population was approximately 200 million. No passage in the Bible mentions +7 billion people (or cars)
2856 2018-10-08 18:47:58 We can't fill our body's with chemicals and be surprised when we develop cancer etc.. Our bodies are capable of fighting viruses.

when OIL increased to 70 price was not adjusted so the deficit of 154 billion has to be adjusted

2927 2018-10-08 18:40:41 Finished reading Donald Duke’s Policy document and asides from its very high level nature, the content betrays a lazy level of intellectual curiosity that has gone into producing it. Vague phrases like diversifying the economy from oil and providing credit to SMEs

2931 2018-10-08 18:40:18 That was the whole purpose of the Middle East demonizing Iran. Shut off their oil exports so Saudis can get more money for theirs. Did anyone really think Persians are suicidal enough to nuke someone on their own continent? We're being lied to -- again.

2935 2018-10-08 18:39:50 Looking forward to Kenji's input. In meantime, Chez Panisse Veg book advice: Cut into bite-size chunks. Saute a few minutes in olive oil til starting to color in spots. Salt. Hit with chopped garlic for a minute, then handful of chopped basil. Finish with a squeeze of lemon.

2980 2018-10-08 18:35:59 We know that allowing North Sea Oil & Gas to be extracted means that it will be burnt, and that the more we burn, the more flooding, droughts, heat waves and food shortages we will experience.  How do we balance that against the well-paid oil jobs in the North East of Scotland?
2981 2018-10-08 18:35:56 RIGHT!!? i learned with tea tree tho is that putting an oil over the spot like coconut or rosehip and then tea tree it like ... doesnt burn ur skin as much?? but ya ppl that say that natural skincare is bad are jus cowards

2987 2018-10-08 18:35:09 It might explain why inflation rates for dried fruits are 5x higher than cheese or dried vegetables. However, the price for oil shows the lowest inflation, so that counts against the theory given that olive oil is a prominent export.

2992 2018-10-08 18:34:35 I have read the 2010 English paper, and I liked how it proposed a new thinking about the Arab Gulf States, away from the reductionist oil/security paradigm which seems to deny the agency of the AGS people and the different realities in which they live.

3027 2018-10-08 18:31:11 Shitgibbon's thinking is an express ticket to deadly rises in global temperature. Tackling climate change means keeping 80% of proven coal, oil and gas reserves  in the ground. And it means less profits for corporate America
3028 2018-10-08 18:31:09 Congress and the WH only have the will to take care of those donors who own them.  The irresponsibility they display comes from "the top" gas & oil special interest.  They may actually be stupid, but their inaction has been paid for.

3038 2018-10-08 18:29:49 Nothing will change when it comes to global warming...the simple fact of that matter is this: Human Beings  'Stop making more money by destroying the planet!'...Oil/Petrol/Solid Fuel CEO's 'Why should I give up my life of luxury when I'll be dead by the time it all goes to shit?'

3041 2018-10-08 18:29:38 couple things:

3049 2018-10-08 18:28:51 Woke up way early to get an oil change and fucking finally did it but now I’m so tired right before work so I’m just gonna chug two cups of coffee and hope it does the trick...wish me luck

3052 2018-10-08 18:28:41 Iran’s oil minister: No oil producing country has such production capacity to fill the gaps in the market. The recent supply by Saudi Arabia was not made from spare capacity but from reserves, to only satisfy the US. Further oil shortage in the market surely increases the prices.

3061 2018-10-08 18:28:12 Remember when the Electoral College stole the presidency from the most radical environmentalist ever to hold national office and awarded it to a guy in the pocket of the oil companies who offered tax credits for buying SUVs?
3062 2018-10-08 18:28:09 BSEE: U.S. GULF OPERATORS SHUT IN 19% OF OIL OUTPUT ON STORM
3063 2018-10-08 18:28:06 You cant " just let anything slip away " that's not what professional do. Consistantbeff9rt every game is a MUST if we want to get better. GO OIL GO!!
3064 2018-10-08 18:27:51 You say he led us into a recession right? If you are really unaware.. The metrics of a dwindling economy and low govt savings (despite high oil rev) was passed on to the new admin. It was about inevitable but then he's led us out of it right? 
3065 2018-10-08 18:27:51 You mean from Casualty 
Very funny Eddie...
3066 2018-10-08 18:27:35 Under Nutley but because of Conservative fiscal policies. Dont forget who got you into this mess. NDP hasnt been in long enough. & Kenney doesnt have a clue. He is Harper’s lap dog and Harper bows to big oil. Blame the ones who did it, not those who inherited it.
3067 2018-10-08 18:27:27 Look up the millions of people who died preventing Hitler from gaining access to oil in the Caspian Sea. 

I'm aware of lend lease.
3068 2018-10-08 18:27:24 Kung Pao.  Red Thai Chili peppers, sesame seed oil, chili paste, soy sauce
3069 2018-10-08 18:27:22 All we need are some tables and 20-sided dice and we can play this game too!  

I demand an apology from <rolls 06> FARMERS about <rolls 19> OIL SPILLS!

Fun Time for the Whole Family!
3070 2018-10-08 18:27:09 Let’s play what’s wrong with Rebecca’s car today  
A. Won’t start
B. Needs an oil change 
C. Squeaks when started 
D. All of the above
3071 2018-10-08 18:27:09 Is old speckeled hen clear fluids  ?
3072 2018-10-08 18:26:43 Yeah literally all of the scientists who haven't received direct funding from the oil/coal/gas industry and have reached unanimous conclusions are definitely being paid by Soros to mislead us, certainly they are where we should direct our skepticism
3073 2018-10-08 18:26:43 He's not honest there's no bread and cooking oil in both OK and Choppies supermarkets right now. The justification is that the only source of forex is the black market.
3074 2018-10-08 18:26:40 Are these oil exports or oil imports? What about mid east countries?
3075 2018-10-08 18:26:39 Shitgibbon's energy policy mirrors GOP's, energy independence & security based on fossil fuels. The priority: “America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy. In fact, America possesses more combined coal, oil, & natural gas resources than any other nation on Earth.”
3076 2018-10-08 18:26:38 Idk why I haven't used a coconut oil hair mask before. My hair feels like the softest ball of grease in the world
3077 2018-10-08 18:26:37 I use marula oil to gently break it all down, then Murad aha/bha cleanser. 
3078 2018-10-08 18:26:29 Nice piece. Looking forward to joining you tomorrow in delivering the message that we need stronger protections from oil and gas wastewater.
3079 2018-10-08 18:26:28 It’s a cry for help, they wish they looked like him. Look at his eyes  jealously. Half of these people ain’t no oil painting themselves.
3080 2018-10-08 18:26:16 The only priority for GOP in SC is to make millions selling weapons, natural gas and oil, while the common citizen has no opportunity to prosper!

3083 2018-10-08 18:25:44 One word. Oil.
3084 2018-10-08 18:25:44 I wasn’t aware Toronto had benefited from oil profits.
3085 2018-10-08 18:25:39 Do chefs recommend using olive oil for amagwinya?
3086 2018-10-08 18:25:37 I go to Toronto almost every week, my kids live there, and I still own property there.
My neighbours went to work in the oil patch when they lost their local jobs. They usually worked 3 weeks, and were home for 2 weeks.
3087 2018-10-08 18:25:33 @PiyushGoyal sir in the backdrop of falling rupee and rising oil prices and we are importing so much of oil, I remember in childhood all short distance trains used to run on coal, we as a country have vast coal reserves y can't we explore coal engines once again on short routes
3088 2018-10-08 18:25:28 Tbh that PIGB tackles the corruption in our oil sector that the president himself sits on. See it through and enforce it and it'll effectively cut the president's power by half. It'll take someone Atiku may not be to do that. But I'm hopeful jobs will come..
3089 2018-10-08 18:25:27 What if I put root beer into my oil diffuser
3090 2018-10-08 18:25:26 Where's Charlie Fairhead?

3095 2018-10-08 18:25:06 The colors in this are lovely, I always mess with brightness and contrast because I love the oil colors look....
3096 2018-10-08 18:25:04 mixin basil, parmesan and olive oil with grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants, hey presto i call that hay pesto
3097 2018-10-08 18:24:58 Even with lower oil import for generation we are paying higher cost of electricity than we used to pay in zardari era when oil was 115$ bbl.
3098 2018-10-08 18:24:57 324,190 B/D OF U.S. GOM CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION SHUT IN ON MICHAEL: BSEE. #OOTT
3099 2018-10-08 18:24:56 Mom’s boyfriend gets off the phone with his son, looks at me, and states, “He calls ‘cause his car needs an oil change and has no money, so I had to wire him more money. All you kids are the same.”

Bro, I pay for all my crap. You don’t even help my mom with her rent, and I do 
3100 2018-10-08 18:24:54 I clearly explained that they are two causes in some instances its supply side and in others its demand side. Eg cooking oil could be more demand side since some producers have stated they have stock.
3101 2018-10-08 18:24:31 They call Edinburgh the Athens of the North...maybe they don't want another Greece? Once the oil and gas runs out...what do they have? The EU already control the once amazing fishing industry!
3102 2018-10-08 18:24:25 Not allowed cake yet. Clear fluids for now.
3103 2018-10-08 18:24:23 Assigning emissions to a producer doesn't make sense in the case of oil companies, since it's the consumer who actually releases the emissions
3104 2018-10-08 18:24:21 It will only happen when the noses of all clubs lie bleeding on the empty  stadium floor as a result of each cutting their own off. As oil is to the oil industry so stupidity is to football and Hampden is Stupidity Central.

3109 2018-10-08 18:24:04 Coal import bill and Chinese return on investment is more than the oil import, you just ignored it.

3111 2018-10-08 18:24:01 Inflationary pressure comes from rent-seeking in respect of oil & finance capital (aka interest rate increases). Labour no longer has meaningful bargaining power.

3114 2018-10-08 18:23:54 But we can't afford it unless you help us.After all you have all the oil, renewable energy, fishing, farm produce , English Malt Whisky, the Scottish tourism industry.........ooops and the English water to put in your English whisky 
3115 2018-10-08 18:23:36 ORANGE CHICKEN!! And they have a bbq teriyaki chicken. Also tempting trail mix, jasmine rice, and olive oil chocolate cake.

3119 2018-10-08 18:22:40 We did nothing to them when they helped the Terrorist pilots bring down the World Trade Centers, all because of OIL. Do you really think we will do anything now ? We already set the precedent, OIL over 3000 dead. You are useless Lindsey, utterly useless. Full of words, no action.
3120 2018-10-08 18:22:40 The measures taken are not meant to finance excess govt spending but a measure to block the bleeding economy. Dont criticise without getting to the bottom of the issue. Ghanas problems are not like wht we hv here. Ghana has oil.
3121 2018-10-08 18:22:27 reduce oil production,boosted the region's economy as well as overall UScrude output.But,it’s a chicken-egg story.Steel tariffs prevent midstream expansion opportunities. For more see this thread below

3123 2018-10-08 18:22:06 A good reminder of how insecure Russian leadership is. Putin’s regime leads a sputtering oil/gas-dependent economy and basically has no international credibility, but hey, he’s got a Dagastani champion in an American-owned organization. I’d say that’s a win for Putin, not Khabib
3124 2018-10-08 18:22:05 "WE WANT to end social welfare programs"

YES
Here's $175 BILLION in social programs

Subsidies
Farm      $22 B
Oil          $40 B
Ethanol  $20 B
Housing $15 B
Dairy      $20 B
Beef       $38B
Pork      $20 B

How soon can we end them?

3126 2018-10-08 18:21:56 @realDonaldTrump Well, let's not give anyone an exemption to any country in the oil embargo on November, ending the work on November 4th, and do not pay attention to the price of oil, I promise you and guarantee this.
3127 2018-10-08 18:21:52 So Nordhaus, a Yale professor, whose every single global warming prediction about oil prices and available resources has been dead wrong, wins the Nobel Prize in economics?!? 

What a joke! 
3128 2018-10-08 18:21:41 I hear from realiable WhatsApp groups that RAW has mobilised its agents armed with canisters of castor oil.

3130 2018-10-08 18:21:35 Thanks for the irrelevant response. How many manual labour jobs on the oil patch require MBAs or genius-level IQs? I'm pointing out that not every worker in the restaurant biz gains from tip income. But that can't be new information for you...
3131 2018-10-08 18:21:18 But they weren't ordained, there is no evidence of that. Also since Women physically can't be ordained it's impossible. Sure you can dress her is ordinands clothes and lay hands and break out the oil and intend for it to happen but, since she isn't the propermatter it isn't valid

3136 2018-10-08 18:21:04 Liberal globalista que sería? Violar la misma constitución que aprobaste ilegalmente, concesionándole a Standar Oil? o mas bien tomar un credito secreto al Exim Bank?
3137 2018-10-08 18:21:03 Only solution is to end gerrymandering in Michigan and oust Leonard and the rest of the GOP. They have brought nothing but misery to the state. Snyder just colluded with big gas/oil to wreak our great lakes. ENOUGH!!!!
3138 2018-10-08 18:20:52 We will see I guess, but my prediction is that things will be moving in the right direction quite soon. Gas and oil prices are very volatile and as such hard to predict long term.
3139 2018-10-08 18:20:44 Crude oil hanging off cliff mode. would have to loss 74 to see some selling, as we go into close. 10 mins to go

3141 2018-10-08 18:20:27 #3Novices : Hope Floats for Offshore Oil Drillers The merger of Ensco and Rowan’ makes sense, but the rally in their shares so far this year is premature because there is no sign of improving rates for their rigs this year or next, despite higher crude prices. …

3145 2018-10-08 18:20:01 In 1977, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States( incredible as it may seem), confidently predicted that "we could use up all of the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade."
3146 2018-10-08 18:20:01 Never done a very good job at it. Could always use tips for thickening up my beard. I hear castor oil works?
3147 2018-10-08 18:20:00 It helps whiten teeth, prevents cavities, improve gum health n so much more it’s called oil pulling
3148 2018-10-08 18:19:58 Huh, I've never seen a recipe that called for use of those... I suppose except maybe a tiny bit of oil to keep the onion from sticking while you sauté it. Most recipes I see are basically tomato, herbs, onion, spices, and once in a while some form of sweetener for balance...
3149 2018-10-08 18:19:46 Bring my car to Nissan for a $30 oil change. Somehow left spending $85 on who knows what....

3158 2018-10-08 18:18:25 Gotta chuckle at many an Oilers fans calling for Benning to be banished to the pressbox.  Understand folks, if the kid can't find his game they are in derp trouble. Needs to figure it out and find hid game. Not sit and watch.
3159 2018-10-08 18:18:19 That research directly and purposefully contradicts pretty much all other research on early childhood education and is funded by a guy who was a hedge fund manager & got all his money from oil. So you see any bias there regarding policies that increase taxes & pay for things?
3160 2018-10-08 18:18:06 Is it time for a change? Auto experts say having your air filters regularly changed is the single most important factor in extending your Volvo’s engine life. Fuel oil filters, for example, protect the injector inlet and injector which are vital to performance.
3161 2018-10-08 18:18:01 how long can you drive with you change oil light on before it gets deep
3162 2018-10-08 18:17:59 What’re you doing with your life??? Go get an oil change.
3163 2018-10-08 18:17:58 Your false argument about having no other companies is hilarious when Schlumberger $SLB, the world's largest oil services company, which has been IN HOUSTON since the 1930s, is just as equally viable if not more so, then there's Baker Hughes, then Technip and many others 
3164 2018-10-08 18:17:58 The only thing that can be said is that it will help keep the Conservatives out of office and it will be a White Elephant because oil will be as good as deadbefore it is much used.

Pakistan has Gold mines, Oil reserves, Gemstones, and many other ground  resources. Why are we not paying attention to get money from there ?
3190 2018-10-08 18:15:00 Yup, it means..we need the oil and gas, and don't want the nuclear fleet parked on the Thames.
3191 2018-10-08 18:14:59 Shitgibbon nominated climate denier Rick Perry for Energy Secretary, & the CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Tillerson was replaced with former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has accepted a million dollars  from oil & gas industries in campaign contributions.

3205 2018-10-08 18:13:51 The rises always look so modest, but then I think the index is based on sliced bread, white flour and milk? If you buy butter, olive oil or wine you will have seen prices rise by up to 30% already.

3209 2018-10-08 18:13:43 The more important part: NY hasn't implemented congestion pricing plans that would save the subway & buses and reduce driving. NYC vehicle registrations and vehicle miles traveled are soaring. NYC is *suing* oil & gas companies, while increasing oil & gas use.

3211 2018-10-08 18:13:38 Apologies, allow me to clarify. I’m pro-economy, and believe big oil taxes spark inflation and economic hardship. I agree with you on investing in renewable energy, but you’re beating a dead horse, because it’s already happening.
3212 2018-10-08 18:13:28 It all boils down to personal preference. Beard Oil is absorbed quicker into the skin and hair while Utility Balm is absorbed slower and is also great for your skin and tattoos. Let us know if you have any questions.

3242 2018-10-08 18:10:08 I hit a pot hole so deep not long ago that broke a welded bracket on my exhaust. I have to have my front end aligned every other oil change. The leaders of this utopia then got embarrassed by the nasty highways, so they raised the gas tax, again.

3247 2018-10-08 18:09:56 Well in my case I moved and forgot my paper where I wrote down how much I had taken and then I took way too much (VitD3 capsules with peanut oil).
3248 2018-10-08 18:09:49 Agree. The pedo case is core. He has a hero fetish and being a martyr world savior is better than admitting a fault of any kind. He called a person child rapist because of criticism on an ad hoc rescue tube. Everything else is always someone else’s fault too: media, oil, shorts
3249 2018-10-08 18:09:45 National Oil Corporation: The #EPSA between NOC, @eni and @BP_plc includes three contract areas, two in the onshore #Ghadames basin and one in the offshore #Sirte basin, covering a total area of around 54,000 km2 #Libya
3250 2018-10-08 18:09:28 They should be called out for fixing the exchange rate when it should have been allowed to adjust to the real market value.That was their biggest failure considering how low the oil prices were.Increase in ir by 250 bp with devaluation of 30% in year is too painful an adjustment
3251 2018-10-08 18:09:15 Okay. Then why play the devil's advocate if you essentially agree with the original/my argument, only disagreeing where TIMING is concerned? It reads like the kind of toothy-grinned defense an oil exec might give for why we shouldn't do anything.

I'm not trying for low fat, I would just rather get my fats from nuts, avocados etc that extracted from them.
3269 2018-10-08 18:08:05 Indeed so why are you forcing through another pipeline, expanding tar/oil sands and increasing tanker traffic through endangered orca territory?

3284 2018-10-08 18:06:25 Now you are talking semantics. It’s a hard concept to believe when your belief system relies on what the present is. And yes oil is a currency. You just don’t use it. But nation states do because it’s part of trade.
3285 2018-10-08 18:06:23 This guy says buy oil and commodity now... When it was going down he was giving interviews now all oil exporting countries will be finished and go bankrupt for ever.

As pro Congress n beneficiary of Cong in cases, he is highly biased in his views towards Cong. I don't trust him
3286 2018-10-08 18:06:18 I def agree altho there are many problems that we cannot wait for the industries to change. Things like meat & oil are heavily tied to the government/subsidized. It’s essential to fight everyday through supply & demand & make an effort to avoid further funding them.
3287 2018-10-08 18:05:54 The time for targets is long gone. It’s time for actual reduction, and that means reducing how much oil/gas/coal are extracted from the ground.  #climate
3288 2018-10-08 18:05:44 Well oil is frowned on but water or Olive oil would be environmentally ok
3289 2018-10-08 18:05:41     For months I have been warning you about oil prices. With GAS prices now almost $3.00 a gallon at the pump, oil prices may go as high as $100.00 a barrel. Inflation. Higher Interests Rates.  Watch your wallet, & spending.
3290 2018-10-08 18:05:37 Uh... i'm so confused... i though that was Nov. 22nd?  Crap i dont have my turkey or peanut oil ready... im so behind.
3291 2018-10-08 18:05:33 Companies and countries have been taking HUGE risks on oil for decades. We must take risks on zero carbon energy and #IPCCReport says we are running out of time.
3292 2018-10-08 18:05:26 There was some of that, but I also recall people being laid off in droves when the price of oil crashed. Some places even laid off Canadian workers and replaced them with cheaper TFWs.

3294 2018-10-08 18:05:21 And I am in Alberta. And the oil patch isn’t necessarily a job of last resort. There are quite a few here who get comfortable with all the cash flow and want the toys. They work it because they want to. For some, sure, but it’s hard work and requires being away from family

3316 2018-10-08 18:03:20 It shouldn’t be. If the carbon-free power industry was as powerful as big oil, it wouldn’t be.
3317 2018-10-08 18:03:11 I recall the oil patch laying people off in droves when the price of oil crashed.  People with grade ten educations who'd gone to work there were suddenly without other employment prospects.  I also recall TFWs replacing some laid off Canadian workers at a lower rate.
3318 2018-10-08 18:03:03 Would you prefer a company or personal tax increase to make up for that removal? And what would help persuade your customers that beyond temporary variations in currency and oil prices, the cost of carbon is  heading one way only?

3325 2018-10-08 18:02:33 @baddestputa___ a foool off that oil
3326 2018-10-08 18:02:32 Primary casing sealed with fresh gaskets. Oil in, battery is charging, no leaks!!! One of only a few rare Royal Enfield bikes that don't leak oil 
3327 2018-10-08 18:02:29 I mean, suppose someone told us the castor oil tastes good as a child growing up...
3328 2018-10-08 18:02:28 If you had any knowledge at all you would know that was down to the oil crisis and miners strike. Don’t let facts and knowledge get in the way of your twat tweets though Chris.
3329 2018-10-08 18:02:25 Back in the days of 100$ oil, it sure felt that way.
The oil patch saved several relatives and neighbours of mine from ruin during the deepest of the recession.
3330 2018-10-08 18:02:21 As a blues fan living in Boston I just naturally push back on any mixing of stl and Boston sports hahaha oil and water. But truly the bruins are low on my list compared to the Sox and pats
3331 2018-10-08 18:02:07 You seem to be misrepresenting my argument and misunderstanding its application. I am not calling for the IMMEDIATE ejection of ALL oil from our energy cocktail. But we do need an IMMEDIATE rollback of oil as a percentage of energy sources and IMMEDIATELY supplanting it with...
3332 2018-10-08 18:02:06 Nothing is made there - I used to work with Primorsk shipping, which basically existed to ship fuel oil to that region. No food either except crab. And I guess that unlike Tyumen and Norilsk, local managers are less good at holding on to the money from natural resources.

3341 2018-10-08 18:01:22 I need Cod Liver Oil Capsules...!!
3342 2018-10-08 18:01:20 One word. Oil. That drives everything (no pun) 
We buy in dollars, which is causing price increases at the pumps. This in turn is absorbed by logistics companies, who in turn pass it on to their contracts, who then squeeze the consumer. Who've already paid more to get to the shop
3343 2018-10-08 18:01:18 Le feu à la raffinerie Irving Oil est maîtrisé. Le Service de police et le Service d'incendie de Saint John restent sur les lieux et l'OGSU-SJ surveille la situation. Certaines rues près de la raffinerie demeurent fermées à la circulation de transit.
3344 2018-10-08 18:01:08 His eyes narrow at the stranger in front of him. He laughs and shakes his head. “Lex...step outta the holy oil come on.” 

“I can’t...” Lex says uncomfortably, her and Dean weren’t on the best of terms. 

He frowns and looks at the angel behind her. “What did you do to her?”
3345 2018-10-08 18:01:06 This time it's international Mr talat not because of pti or Imran khan.its because of oil prices internationally.its not only pak it's US UK IND and all other big economies and big markets even verse than pak stock ...do not manipulate the facts..it's foul ..
3346 2018-10-08 18:00:55 in this year, you've received 326,000 in donations from the oil and gas industry and 55,000 from the natural gas pipeline industry.
how do you reconcile that with yesterday's environmental report?
3347 2018-10-08 18:00:51 I'm not saying removing lactose won't help certain people. My only point was olbas oil nasal spray is natural and it can help with cattarh.

3352 2018-10-08 18:00:20 No, high oil prices supported the oil patch.
Our country did weather the recession much better than the other G7 nations, thanks in part to it.
I am in N. Ontario and several of my neighbours went to AB for work. They didn't have to live there - were flown in and out.
3353 2018-10-08 18:00:17 I seem to be the only person who found Adam Driver as an oil baron attending his son’s career day class to be one of SNL’s funniest skits in years.
3354 2018-10-08 18:00:16 Unlike Jesus, socialists can't miracle food into existence when their economic policy goes awry. Which is why they are starving in Venezuela despite having the largest oil reserves on the planet.
3355 2018-10-08 18:00:15 It’s just the sheer lip in whatever red one idk lol. And the lip oil in cherry... so overpriced lol (especially because the lipstick looks exactly like Nivea touch of color balm in sheer crimson) but I really like the smell and To my delight I’m irresponsible with money
3356 2018-10-08 18:00:14 Why would they need to create Euro$ for oil if they can print CNY for that oil?  Then, foreign oil exporters holding CNH can exchange for Chinese goods, Chinese financial assets, or CNY gold in HK or Dubai at ~8250 CNY.  That CNY gold gets sourced fr London (GLD) or NYC.

3379 2018-10-08 17:58:03 Is there a correlation in Republicans minds that the more people become sick or dead the more money in their 1% overlords pocket?
One example, Big Oil fought for 20 years to keep lead in gas.

3383 2018-10-08 17:57:55 Its unbelievable that  cooking oil has surpassed the  price of fuel per litre. There is still need to assess whether those who own farms really deserve those farms.
3384 2018-10-08 17:57:50 I’m perfectly fine with renewable energy sources becoming the norm. But at the moment, solar panels and battery powered cars aren’t the biggest industry on the planet. Oil has a DIRECT impact on inflation, industry, and progress, you can’t just get rid of them yet.

3393 2018-10-08 17:56:48 The global crude oil price is about to hit US $100 a barrel thanks to US's sanctions on Iran. Meanwhile, India becomes the first country to defy the US in buying crude oil from Iran.

3395 2018-10-08 17:56:19 So what's the big deal ? Pakistan and China also had assured iran to buy their oil when US announced sanctions ... india took a lot of time
3396 2018-10-08 17:56:16 Amid falling foreign currency reserves & rising debt burden, newly installed government of #Pakistan PM Imran #Khan approaches IMF for bailout programme. Move follows Saudi Arabia gov said to have refused delaying payments for oil imports last week

3410 2018-10-08 17:55:05 OBVIOUSLY carbon taxes (i.e. reducing supply of oil) needs to be paired with increasing the available supply of renewable energy. Which of course demands public investiture in renewable technologies and infrastructure development. The private sector won't save us, they'll kill us
3411 2018-10-08 17:54:57 The fleas that carry it do not like lemon oil.

3413 2018-10-08 17:54:51 In which case China is going to have to continue to create shedloads of dollar credit aka Euro$ (or exchange reserve assets for $) to pay for physical oil at >$80/bbl. Because the purpose of an oil futures contract is as a benchmark for physical oil, not delivery
3414 2018-10-08 17:54:51 now that i have a vegan friend ima be asking dumb questions like “is olive oil vegan”
3415 2018-10-08 17:54:07 I had oil delivered today just in case. €717.74. That had better last until about April!
3416 2018-10-08 17:54:05 Almay’s oil free one is the best of the inexpensive ones I’ve ever tried.
3417 2018-10-08 17:53:58 Look, millions, perhaps billions, of people will die from starvation, disease, and thirst if we don't destroy the oil companies. It is morally incumbent on us to destroy them and replace them with renewable energies. Obviously Carbon taxes aren't the only way.
3418 2018-10-08 17:53:42 Is a fair call.

Won't be helped by NZ Govt decision to ban oil and gas exploration and nuclear free stance.

They don't even have money to pay for the oil. Right now they are begging Saudi for oil.

3450 2018-10-08 17:51:13 In order to reach a climat change stop all the world would have to cooperate in the efforts. But that is more than unlike for who can convince China or India to stop their old coal and oil undustries. They say: If other nations did in the past, we do so now.

3459 2018-10-08 17:50:20 I’m allergic to fish, so I make mine with truffle oil! Sooooo gooooood. Mushroom powder sounds similar in it’s non-fishy deliciousness!

3461 2018-10-08 17:50:13 but now needs to get oil & gas workers into other jobs - petro is killing us
3462 2018-10-08 17:50:13 The reason the oil industry is NOT lobbying against global warming is that the owners of the oil industry is the same people who want global government through UN Agenda 2030 which is motivated by global warming?

Yea, I know about the costly monitors, which they promptly cut off before disappearing into the general population. Gains are marginal at best, but the only way increase efficiency #VoteRed2018

3474 2018-10-08 17:49:24 Both get the Golden Fleece award. If I could afford a hybrid vehicle I would switch but still way out of my price range unfortunately. Consecutive governments keep on piling on taxes plus yes greedy oil companies banging up margins. $2.42 a litre in Dargaville. RIPOFF!

Maybe there are different cannabinoids that is helping. Who knows. But I’ve seen it first hand. Using hemp CBD did nothing to her seizures. Weed CBD works
3484 2018-10-08 17:48:56 Please for the love of our planet do something kind to it once a day. Reuse grocery bags, recycle as much as you can, carpool, don't vote for Republicans or people paid for by oil companies, plant trees.
3485 2018-10-08 17:48:53 Zimbabwe is open for business, with the rate at which people are buying basic goods I tell you that enough revenue is being generated the thing is all that is bought isn't replaced, take advantage and supply, cooking oil, fuel, etc.
3486 2018-10-08 17:48:50 Oh I’m sure some rocket scientist will say otherwise. Probably a oil Barron
3487 2018-10-08 17:48:47 I'd rather we diversify our economy so that every time oil prices are down our dollar doesn't plumet.

3489 2018-10-08 17:48:47 The Clintons have raised over 3 billion dollars in lifetime contributions from pharmaceutical companies, wall street banks, the oil industry, and even private prisons- same as republicans. Their brand of Democrat is close to extinction, thank god.
3490 2018-10-08 17:48:46 @ChelseaClinton I tried the "play nice " response and feel much better.  That was a definite step up from agitation.  I'm not sure if it was that or my new CBD oil regime,  but a combo works!
3491 2018-10-08 17:48:26 Cleaning up after coal burning stoves and furnaces leaves me with the opinion that clean coal is bullsht. Grandfather had black lung. Told my dad to do anything but be a miner. Dad became a scientist who worked on improving our energy independence. Shale oil is a stepping stone.

3498 2018-10-08 17:47:34 Yes, that was my point. Sure, the politicians are stealing Nigeria's money. But so are those oil companies who have those politicians in their pockets.
3499 2018-10-08 17:47:26 its only to those who are not in touch with what is on the ground who think l am throwing tantarums when cooking oil being sold to poor pple @ $15 per 2 ltr
3500 2018-10-08 17:47:16 Although promising in theory, larger import taxes on the most expensive US import spells bad news for the economy. Remember the oil crisis of 1973? The country still runs on oil

The ones made locally use majorly imported RM.

3525 2018-10-08 17:45:18 Officials say it's believed there are a "couple'' of minor injuries from today's massive oil refinery explosion in Saint John, N.B.
3526 2018-10-08 17:45:16 All we can look forward to freezing cold homes with the ban on oil and gas higher green taxes. Global warming no such thing if anything we are heading towards a mini ice age and that’s fact not fiction. The world gone nuts.

3528 2018-10-08 17:45:08 It’s not ridiculous. On a forward basis outlook we don’t value coins that already exist. We value new coins. You don’t price every barrel of oil we have made at $75 and call that oil market cap or GDP. You are only pricing new oil.

3530 2018-10-08 17:45:00 Google and social is like oil and water, everything single attempt they've made as been a flop. Search is their only DNA, everything else is an afterthought IMO
3531 2018-10-08 17:44:40 One could say it's the gross incompetence of the politicians which also enables the multinational corporations suck our natural resources dry. For instance, does it make sense that Nigeria(Africa's largest oil producer) imports most of the petroleum products it uses?
3532 2018-10-08 17:44:40 the tatcha cleansing oil! you don't even have to double cleanse
3533 2018-10-08 17:44:29 I personally think we're fucked. We're still fighting wars for oil and to prop up the petro-dollar. We have no intention to transfer to green energy solutions because corporate entities don't want to. We needed to be starting this shit like 20 years ago lbs.
3534 2018-10-08 17:44:29 Still the car aint ready.
The radiator is kinda fixed but idk if the exhaust problem can be fixed.
The engine is quite worn out and burns oil,
Idk if the compression is low or something and it smells too much exhaust from the tail pipe idk.
Im so tired. I hardly slept.

3539 2018-10-08 17:43:37 So unrelated but often compared. If that's your point I agree. I am Canadian, some families bring you up one way or the other. Also I don't think you could add more fat to mayo, 50% ish hydrogenated oil

3542 2018-10-08 17:43:13 One day I had a headache in the centre of Harare. Wanted to take a painkiller and was looking for a drink. Went to a couple of supermarkets. No drinks. Finally in 1 shop, a plastic bottle with a liquid on an otherwise empty shelf. Got all excited only to discover it was lamp oil.

3554 2018-10-08 17:42:03 Hi: this morning an oil refinery in Saint John New Brunswick had an explosion and ensuing fire and smoke. Who can tell me how far from the epicenter of the refinery would be devastated should the worst happen: the refinery generally explode? There is no info here in the center
3555 2018-10-08 17:42:01 You mean the Cryptocurrency Petro backed by Venezuela Govt with 1 barrel crude oil has no value while the other cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum etc backed by thin air, greed and opinions have intrinsic value. Wow!Quite a study @NicolasMaduro
3556 2018-10-08 17:41:56 As someone with incredibly sensitive skin, even the supposed gentlest of products is too harsh for me. So I use jojoba oil or almond oil or in a pinch, olive oil, and they do the trick!
3557 2018-10-08 17:41:44 At the rate of rollbacks and increased oil drilling the drinking water is nearly finished...sooner than we are anticipating
3558 2018-10-08 17:41:37 SPAR! Oil mill market.
3559 2018-10-08 17:41:34 Now prices of oil, LNG have increased a lot.
Only solution is to increase exports, remittances and FDI quickly.
Fuel imports should be replaced by hydel & nuclear power and coal power plants using Thar coal
3560 2018-10-08 17:41:24 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
3561 2018-10-08 17:41:21 nooooooo!!! coconut oil isn’t actually that great, it clogs your pores terribly. try a jojoba oil instead!
3562 2018-10-08 17:41:19 How do you suggest we “regulate” the largest oil conglomerates in the world?
3563 2018-10-08 17:41:15 Being workforce ready means being in environments that have access to  the internet. There is not one job that is not affected by digital tools--from the oil change guy, customer service, to the VP of marketing.
3564 2018-10-08 17:41:14 Politicians are salesmen for MIC.

If lemons only grew in war zones, lemon sellers would make the same argument as the politicians. But we'd immediately sense the conflict of interest.

Why not so with oil, war and missiles?
3565 2018-10-08 17:41:12 Coconut oil + a warm damp cotton ball & it’ll never get on your towels again
3566 2018-10-08 17:41:10 Data is often described as ‘the new oil’, but for me, that’s far too simplistic, focusing only on a value proposition. A more nuanced view is to regard data as water – it’s bloody useful if you’re in a desert, but you can also drown in the stuff.
3567 2018-10-08 17:41:08 i love almond oil for this

3573 2018-10-08 17:40:45 I agree, Minister, but your govt's Pan-Cdn Framework is not up to the job. We need a plan to phase out fossil fuels extraction, exports, and combustion.

3579 2018-10-08 17:40:12 Get some!
3580 2018-10-08 17:40:10 Big point imo. Many people work for companies invested in big oil and status quo capilialism. Most don't want to think they're literally contributing to the end of our species and if they do question things, blacklisting in all its subtle and not so subtle forms is always there.

Good you’re launching your own Satellite...

But
Why -

Have you given permission
For so many oil drilling’s ???

Why are you continuing 
the focus on
Fossil fuels,
and 
Disregarding local and Native Peoples?

3586 2018-10-08 17:39:48 With oil revenues plummeting, Kremlin finances are hurting.  Putin probably was forced to raise retirement age.
3587 2018-10-08 17:39:46 The whole process will be accelerated by oil wars.

3592 2018-10-08 17:39:04 Girl, just pray you don’t get dry sockets. No straws and no sucking on ANYTHING (don’t eat popsicles because you end up sucking on those). Only eat food that you can swallow without chewing or having to “slurp” up. Get clove oil if you do get dry sockets.

3594 2018-10-08 17:38:59 You know you’re weird when you’re at Walmart getting your oil changed, casually browsing Halloween decorations and you think ‘don’t they have any rats?’ 
3595 2018-10-08 17:38:55 Palm oil is a pretty common ingredient in prepared foods. I'd think you've probably eaten it before in other things.
3596 2018-10-08 17:38:37 It would be swell if Conservative and oil supporters would acknowledge that wasting energy is part of the goal. Instead, they let their vehicles idle when they run into the store, crank up their furnaces, leave lights on, let waste water etc, etc. Then, get made at carbon tax.
3597 2018-10-08 17:38:25 9/11 didn’t damage the US/Saudi relations and nothing will as long as they got the $$.Maybe when their oil is gone would be a different story.
3598 2018-10-08 17:38:22 Someone make an oil painting of this
3599 2018-10-08 17:38:09 And he and other children will appreciate Maye's efforts because of the ability to drink water not poisoned by oil.

3605 2018-10-08 17:37:52 아,널 호수에 빠트려 버릴수도 있겠지
아님 독바른 생일케이크를 먹일수도 있고
부정은 안 해,네가 죽고 나면 솔직히 좀 그립긴 할꺼야
이럴바엔 차라리 산채로 묻어버릴까?
그랬다간 칼로 관을 쪼개고 도망쳐 나올수도 있으니까
그리고 그칼로 잠든 날 찔러죽일지도 몰라
그래서 확실히 죽이려는 거야
3606 2018-10-08 17:37:44 Its been 1 month of coconut oil usage. My skin is definitely softer and my lines are less visable. My skin doesn't dry out like it use to after washing my face with cetaphil. I'll continue using this and update in another month because I don't see a whole lot of change. =)
3607 2018-10-08 17:37:41 PTI always left IMF as an option. 
When it promised to keep Oil and Gas prices low, oil was $50 a barrel. It is now $78. 
You need to check CIRCULAR DEBT. 
PPP borrowed 500 Bil & Nawaz1200 to charge less than cost. 
Please stay with complete facts. Don't mislead the nation.

3648 2018-10-08 17:35:34 We’ve BEEN seeing it, for decades, but at least half of the population of this country was willfully blind. They don’t care, and their representatives are in the pocket of Big Oil, so I’d say we’re pretty well doomed unless we can get them out of office.
3649 2018-10-08 17:35:29 Gotta mix things up to keep them confused—Throw some tires and motor oil into your cart along with a fake Christmas Tree and menorah 
3650 2018-10-08 17:35:27 We are paying double the price for pms than we were paying when crude was over $100. Remember we have to pay higher subsidy when oil prices go up.

#Oil is produced @ ~743 STB/day under a Pwf of 5500 psia from a reservoir rock having a permeability of 20 mD with P(reservoir) = 6000 psia through a 6” hole.

What could most likely contribute to the high flow rate?

3718 2018-10-08 17:29:14 Nah. The path of least resistance is to do nothing. The second easiest thing to do is geoengineering: stratospheric aerosol injection - deploy fake volcanic ash - 24/7/365 to block a percentage of sunlight). I expect we'll do that because no one is willing to fight big oil/coal.
3719 2018-10-08 17:29:12 If Scotland was independent we would get paid for the power we send to England (rather than charges for providing it to the grid), we would control 100% oil revenues, we could improve our ports and direct exports to rEU. What makes you think Scotland would be poorer?
3720 2018-10-08 17:29:11 Poor is the operative word. Poor world experience, poor distribution of wealth & education, poor integration, thus poor understanding of anybody that ain’t “us”...  Oil wealth to crushing poverty in a short time.

3723 2018-10-08 17:28:38 And I did not say oil prices is going down, I said the increase in price is slowing down.
3724 2018-10-08 17:28:31 Made Aglio e Olio again. Last time I fucked up and way overcooked my garlic so it was too bitter, but this time it's much, much better.

Seriously, for something that takes literally only three ingredients in pasta, oil and garlic (and salt & pepper & cayenne but those don't...
3725 2018-10-08 17:28:28 1) And renewable energy is so EASY It's all around us in the sun and the wind. There is absolutely NO EXCUSE except that the coal and oil barons don't want their very lucrative empires to become obsolete. So we destroy the planet under our feet for the very few oligarchs' greed.

3729 2018-10-08 17:27:54 I deeply care about the safety of morons.
Why I moved from city 20 yrs ago. 
Worst I ever did, run over a guy's foot, after telling him 3 times, 2 too many, to back off  from truck. No I'm not buying $5 diamond ring and I'm not waiting around to be robbed.
3730 2018-10-08 17:27:51 Hey look, Manhattan in underwater, oh wait, it's not underwater but Al Gore said it would be by now. Al Gore is a Snake Oil Climate Change Salesman not better in his own way than Micheal Moore and his ball cap.   
3731 2018-10-08 17:27:49 I don't really think that IL&FS can main cause of recent market correction. Main cause could be Export falls.  Imports of costly crude oil is increased. Income part of dollar is FDI only for India. 
Wait n watch situation.
3732 2018-10-08 17:27:41 Was it olive oil in the floor or what
3733 2018-10-08 17:27:34 Lucifer shows himself within the technological arrogance of humans. When you see the smog coming out of the tailpipes, oil floating in our oceans and chemtrails in the sky, that is the Tower of Babel being built.  Progress to heaven at any costs then to again make war with god.
3734 2018-10-08 17:27:28 Ok mom told me to put coconut oil so I have rubbed coconut oil all over myself now. I'm still itching but not nearly as bad as before when every part of my body was itching all at once.
3735 2018-10-08 17:27:22 Ive been putting oil in my hair and it feels lush. I'm still a frizzy little bitch tho

3737 2018-10-08 17:27:20 I agree to a large extent. The other point he made, which you curiously ignored, is that Buhari enjoys the proceeds of corruption. 1978 Oil scam, PTF, NNPC etc. Let's vote wisely this time

Most difficult injection to draw up and give
3739 2018-10-08 17:27:09 Wow. Big talk from climate change denier who gets massive contributions from the oil, coal, and lumber industries.
3740 2018-10-08 17:27:05 Can you confirm if he owns an oil well/block too.
Kindly remind me again, he was VP under the most vindictive hard headed president.

3756 2018-10-08 17:24:57 Who is “peeing oil”. That does NOT sound good!
3757 2018-10-08 17:24:55 Nunca denunció a DeVido cuando compraba a precios exorbitantes Gas Oil... además está es una normativa de 1992.... quien y que Gobierno estaba en el Poder?.... sólo se aplica la norma....

3759 2018-10-08 17:24:23 Olive oil with every meal.
3760 2018-10-08 17:24:15 The comparison implied of oil prices in this instance is wrong. India is a low income country where public is forced to pay taxes charged in high income countries to make up deficit numbers by both central &state governments Deficit caused by poor economic policies and corruption
3761 2018-10-08 17:24:00 they agreed to it in condition to no cap on production. also funds from large final emitters to be reinvested into clean tech. oil producers are the winners. they get to use funds from final emmiters to lower their emmisions and produce unlimited oil.
3762 2018-10-08 17:23:58 Also used a combo of aloe vera gel & castor oil as my edge control. And in just a month the flourishing began.

3764 2018-10-08 17:23:53 As a result of the incident at the Irving Oil refinery, NBCC’s Grandview Ave Campus in Saint John is closed to students & staff today. We continue to monitor updates from the city & will provide additional info in the event this further impacts Campus operations going forward.

3767 2018-10-08 17:23:41 You helped us get here, Frum. You pushed a war over oil. You rejected climate science while Bush was in power.

You'll have to loudly and publically atone for your role in this if you want anyone to look to you for moral leadership ever again.

3770 2018-10-08 17:23:27 no-those industries have had sexual harassment attorneys breathing down their necks (with supportive HR departments) for the last 20 years.  Not coincidental that two of those mentioned (banking and oil) are right-leaning. Only now getting to media, Hollywood, Silicon Valley.

3772 2018-10-08 17:23:20 @ScottMorrisonMP is a snake oil salesmen, he morphs into a daggy dad in public to sell his crap, then back to a belligerent bully in parliament. Never blindly trust a salesman.

3784 2018-10-08 17:22:20 Money basically drives agendas with rich investors @ the helm! They said USA was the world's largest energy producer. Is USA still buying much oil from them or is other countries picking up the slack?
3785 2018-10-08 17:22:15 Having a dream is personal. Unfortunately, not everyone aspires to invest or attain financial freedom. They continue to trade their time for money. It’s easier to criticize those who are burning the midnight oil than putting in that extra effort. Business and Sports are the same.
3786 2018-10-08 17:22:12 Have a belief this oil in only being bottled here its brought in tankers.

3789 2018-10-08 17:21:41 How do you define incompetence? PMB came at a time when oil prices were at the lowest. Many oil dependant economies suffered a set back. Nigeria's economy is being diversified and picking up. I guess it is the free for all stealing that you're interested in!
3790 2018-10-08 17:21:32 That UN climate control report is chilling. One wonders though how great a position we could've been in if, the Tories had invested our North Sea Oil money into renewables when thet shutting down the UK's mining industry. Might have served us better than 101 call centres

3793 2018-10-08 17:21:09 The NYT also published an article by some guy defending women should be obliged to have sex with men in order to prevent incel violence, as defended by that snake oil salesman, Peterson. They're opening their nwsp to every extremist, regardless of side.

3800 2018-10-08 17:20:36 People that change their own oil 
3801 2018-10-08 17:20:33 Has anyone told you that the oil price collapsed a few years ago? Easy to play politics here. I guess a better question to ask is how Alberta mismanaged its oil wealth over the last 2 decades. Maybe some lessons learned for future leaders.
3802 2018-10-08 17:20:30 Yup. Instead of taking measures that reduced exposure to global energy prices, their energy policy further increased imported energy reliance. Now Pakistan requires imported oil, LNG, and coal to meet its energy needs! It’s a significant national security risk.
3803 2018-10-08 17:20:29 The days of bogus military contracts and dubious oil deals are gone for the good of Nigeria. IBB and his cohorts will surfer another torrid four years under Buhari.

3817 2018-10-08 17:19:05 Congrats to Prof Nordhaus, who was once my professor at Yale. In the seventies he pointed out that the price of oil could not keep going ever upward, but that at certain price pts, alternatives would kick in and bound oil prices.

3821 2018-10-08 17:18:59 Also note (per my original tweet) how much better gas is than oil/coal.

But Corbyn opposes fracking, and as late as 2015 was talking about reopening coal mines.

So, please don't make this about him, because he is not a good ally for sensible environmentalists.

3834 2018-10-08 17:17:56 Worse still, the 300 m long container vessel (red flat deck) was lying completely still at anchor. The white CoTuNav ferry ran right into it while leaving port on the way to Tunisia. (None of them are oil tankers though. The spill is from fuel oil in the container vessel.)

3844 2018-10-08 17:16:57 You could do a helluva lot worse than a revenue-neutral carbon tax. In fairness to producers such as the Oil and Gas industry and farmers, you'd provide input carbon tax credits for exports.  They need to compete globally.  The rest of us would gradually buy better cars etc.
3845 2018-10-08 17:16:53 It's our fault as a specie. The Chinese and Indians are moving towards clean energy, and away from coal/oil.
3846 2018-10-08 17:16:52 Huh? What a funny silly stat. These two running backs are like water and oil- Like how you twist it. Connor can tie Bell shoelace if /when he gets back.
3847 2018-10-08 17:16:50 I don’t think it would do that, I read Spearmint helps too with kiddos I’ve used it as an essential oil and it never messed with my milk

3851 2018-10-08 17:16:35 Hydrate (As in at least a litre of water a day), and invest in Eucalyptus oil. You may also need a (de)humidifier. It's usually something permanently irritating your sinuses x
3852 2018-10-08 17:16:32 Chavez and Maduro had "great" plans and just like any socialist/communist government in the past, it worked well, but then began to cripple the country and now you have Venezuela. they also relied to much on oil export, but they would crumble regardless. 1 million % inflation btw
3853 2018-10-08 17:16:10 Turkey’s Erdogan says Saudi Arabia must prove its claims over Khashoggi. US Senators demand explanation. US- Saudi Showdown looming large. Existential battle for MBS. Trouble in Saudi Arabia & its neighbourhood will result in oil price soaring. Situation needs watching.
3854 2018-10-08 17:16:09 Oil prices are not based on incomes.
3855 2018-10-08 17:16:07 The Saudis are dropping bombs on weddings, funerals, and school buses in Yemen and you are complicit. Murdering, terrorist, oil despots and war profiteers.

3857 2018-10-08 17:16:01 I bet you're none too grateful for the Irving oil refinery inferno today. I understand that Alberta's very keen on making easy cash on selling their tar sands, but incidents like these make it clear that the entire business is fundamentally fraught with peril.

3859 2018-10-08 17:15:48 Oil and coal billionaires are dinosaurs not willing to move forward with renewable energy. Fear of the old white man dying screams.

3863 2018-10-08 17:15:31 I was rly nervous about my interview, so I stopped by starbz to get coffee and a cute old man came up to me asking why I was dressed so nicely. He said I looked slicker than oil, am “as cute as a button” and am going to get the job  that was EVERYTHING I needed to hear rn wow

3866 2018-10-08 17:15:17 I made these stupid, essentially just coconut oil, peppermint cups today and my boss is throwing every single one away. LOL I made 80 of these things. They're not pepperminty enough and taste like oil. Well yeah it is literally just a ton of coconut oil.
3867 2018-10-08 17:15:06 Why? Because the corrupt UN says so? You should be able to come up with a ‘climate plan’ that doesn’t involve taxing Canadians. A tax just makes life more expensive in a cold climate, and does absolutely nothing to fight your ‘climate change’. Sell your snake oil somewhere else!

3879 2018-10-08 17:14:12 Yes I did this is old ! It’s false and stoked  by oil companies !

3881 2018-10-08 17:14:08 Literally hemp oil from Whole Foods. It’s non comedogenic so it won’t clog your pores, and it moisturizes your skin 
3882 2018-10-08 17:14:08 Russia has the largest remaining proven oil reserve in the world. Under the Arctic Sea. It also has some of the largest NatGas reserves. U.S. will be much more negatively affected by changing climate than Russia will be.
3883 2018-10-08 17:14:01 We can get rid of this quickly but the amount of fossil fuels require for the transition is more than it replaces. Now should we ; owe fuck yes. The problem ;we know we are not in control beyond boycotting items we don’t want to use ! And we have no ability to boycott oil !
3884 2018-10-08 17:14:00 I often wonder if the people funding the pipeline protests hold portfolios with rail and trucking stocks. The oil is still making it to market albeit in a much more carbon-unfriendly and dangerous way.
3885 2018-10-08 17:14:00 
3886 2018-10-08 17:13:59 Most likely.  I live in the VanCity area and work out of town in Fire, Forestry & Oil medical support roles and the difference is very real. Even Northern BC vs Metro BC is massive. It's basically Metro vs Rural. IMO anyways.
3887 2018-10-08 17:13:57 I went to pick n pay westgate with my mom there was no sight of cooking oil or bread coz people had already bought everything out of panick. And it seems like this unit of things per person isnt a joke tatobuda tine ma packet edu two esugar one unit per person zim is a joke

3892 2018-10-08 17:13:46 But no issue with big Corp donations like NRA And big oil. That is extortion, votes bought and paid for.
3893 2018-10-08 17:13:45 Like damn, why would I buy petrol when I can buy oil futures outright with significantly less risk of a dictatorship...

They are going to give at least 50% discount for the petrol before it’s worth.
3894 2018-10-08 17:13:45 1) That's the official IRS reimbursement number. 
2) I don't think it's *that* wrong?  

Assume between 200K and 250K miles.  

$20-$25,000 car is 10 cents a mile, gas is 10 cents (Gas *Tax* is 1-1.5 cents by the way), a $60 oil change every 6000 is a penny...
3895 2018-10-08 17:13:43 Peppermint oil can cause a decrease in supply  I’ve heard using it does and ingesting it and then I just heard that even breathing in the oil can cause a decrease since some people are so sensitive to it 
3896 2018-10-08 17:13:33 Finally has a day off at work, decides to go get oil change has has to wait *two* hours at honda.

3912 2018-10-08 17:12:48 you repeat left wing propaganda. there is so much coal theu cannot run out of t even if they want to. "they" used that same lie back in the 1970's with oil. a big lie then , a big lie now

This is not about a simple choice!

3929 2018-10-08 17:10:57 Canada has a serious Dr Jekyll / Mr Hyde complex.

Mr Hyde is bitumen-phobic (but loves imported dictator oil), illegally protests at the mere mention of a pipeline, and screams "social license!"
3930 2018-10-08 17:10:57 Or, we could stop burning fucking coal, oil and natural gas.

Either way, you know, either or.
3931 2018-10-08 17:10:52 Brilliant so your confirming electricity, oil, gas etc all won't be going up after the budget and the extra 2.50 euro I come out with at the end of the week from the budget won't be taken back off me and more....

3954 2018-10-08 17:09:39 @jimcramer I see you have jumped on the blame-the-fed bandwagon. Look deeper to the reasons behind: trade tantrums from WH, oil disruptions, decimated low-wage worker pool via overly harsh immigration policy, also WH directed. Oh yes, and there's the budget. . .

3966 2018-10-08 17:08:54 When i said global iam talking of all countries eg USA a super power.
Multiple factors have caused this increase in the price, including the continued political turmoil in oil exporter Venezuela, US sanctions on Iran and a simultaneous worldwide increase in demand.

If your not wearing a badge, good luck in stopping me in a similar situation.  You better be quick on your feet. Its intolerable, people fearing for their safety.
3990 2018-10-08 17:06:20 @jerseymikes forgot the oil & vinegar on my wrap. I could cry. I also had to remind them to put #mayo on it. If they would have forgotten that too, thing would have been so much worse.

3998 2018-10-08 17:05:41 Harrassing #Tesla is for the protection of future revenue. Every month they could delay or kill Tesla is worth trillions of dollars of oil revenue during the ending years of fossil fuel cars. AND they make bank shorting as well. Scrape off the crud, you'll see the Koch brothers.
3999 2018-10-08 17:05:40 @nitin_gadkari @arunjaitley 

Can we also consider -
- ranking our cities based on their level of use of public vs private transport?
- incentivize any organisation that saves oil by car pooling or switching to e-vehicles?
Small solutions can bring big results.

4028 2018-10-08 17:03:08 You just know that as "SNP Member Yes Ambassador" @Norrie30 would have defended @AlexSalmond's oil revenue figures at the time, and probably now insists that they're still correct because she overheard a police officer say that oil production is a lot higher than WM admits.
4029 2018-10-08 17:02:58 Tar sands are among the dirtiest fossil fuels in the world, and a lot of Canada's resource extraction happens on stolen land with none of the constitutionally enshrined consultation with FNIM people.  Canada's oil is dirty and unethical, and we should do better.

4037 2018-10-08 17:02:24 A complete failure to understand the link between citizens costs and the price of fuel. An economy rests on some critical pillars, one being protection of property rights and oil/fuel being a common element to all other economic activities. It must be kept as low as possible
4038 2018-10-08 17:02:05 is it time for Buhari to travel to save our stock market? your guess is as good as mine, where does that leave us with Atiku?

4053 2018-10-08 17:00:58 This is idiocy -just because we have found more oil doesn’t mean it’s not a finite supply with limits on it -no one who predicted we would run out is wrong just maybe wrong about how soon

4086 2018-10-08 16:58:25 We might argue here on twitter & try to score some points however the reality is cooking oil is generally $10 countrywide. Moreso it is scarce

4124 2018-10-08 16:54:13 We need to work on education b/c I know my mom knew nothing about it when she struggled with #cancer. 

CBD oil helped her with the pain more than the #pharmaceuticals she said. She refused the HydroMorph.

4125 2018-10-08 16:54:00 We are so sorry! That is always tough. Have you ever considered trying CBD oil for your pets?
4126 2018-10-08 16:53:58 Can u bring oil price to 70$. Everything will be connected again.

4130 2018-10-08 16:53:29 There is nothing I hate more than art critics that don’t even make art. Are you just making shit up? Do you even know how oil paint works? Do you know how any of this works
4131 2018-10-08 16:53:27 Put up or shut up Collins, tell your party to stop taking money from big oil and firearm companies and slave wage companies and big pharma.
4132 2018-10-08 16:53:20 Yes now -"oil prices had begun steadily decline", I sent you a graph showing this. *sigh*
so bad policies no dey am, yea? 

Keep in mind that oil is 10.29% of our economy though
4133 2018-10-08 16:53:11 Saudi Aramco, the largest company in the world with over 250Bn barrels of proven oil reserve is going on IPO worth $2 Trn in 2021. Yet Nigeria with only 37Bn proven reserve cannot even pass PIGB talk less of IPO listing. If we want to truly fight corruption? Open NNPC to markets.
4134 2018-10-08 16:53:07 she does not even know how to add her own oil to her car let alone know a thing about racing. A real fraud just like her daddy. NC show them the door
4135 2018-10-08 16:53:04 @senatemajldr You are a shame and a disgrace to our fine state. Your oil painting will be made with corporate interests your first priority, then your Russian oligarchs who funded your campaign, along with the rest of your donors. Then last come the people that elected you. #SHAM
4136 2018-10-08 16:52:59 Party will not change until it has to. They rely on corporate money and have one master. It is not us. They just went back on their pledge to not take fossil fuel money. The planet is facing imminent destruction and they can’t stop taking big oil blood money.

4139 2018-10-08 16:52:42 @CBCNews It's hard to hear the interviews about the Irving oil explosion with the background "despair and dread" music.

4158 2018-10-08 16:50:10 I don’t understand why big oil isn’t building a BIG E charging network around the world. They have all it would take, connections and partner network. But am just a BIG brain in a small world, or was it the other way round.

4173 2018-10-08 16:48:39 Just to confirm with you there’s no oil under Faslane. Thats why they built the ship lift there. It’s impervious rock. North of HBF. There is however oil under the Clyde but the MOD won’t allow development of it because of the subs. You were nearly right but no coconut.

4179 2018-10-08 16:48:03 This is the problem at all oil depots across India. Results in a huge damage to dealers in terms of shortage in inventory. A joint effort should be taken against it by OMC officers, Dealer & Local administration to curb it.
4180 2018-10-08 16:47:57 Data is the new oil
4181 2018-10-08 16:47:55 Good observation. Forcefully building it is indeed fascism. 

S/he's the sort that really doesn't care about the Oil and Gas Industry. They only care about pipelines as a partisan talking point. They don't care about realistic solutions, and don't care about industry stability.

4198 2018-10-08 16:46:52 Kanang OPEC (organization of the petroleum exporting countries) kay nag cut off sa supply sa crude oil para mo boost ang prices nya mas dako nuon sila ma ginansya. So its all business

4207 2018-10-08 16:46:16 The upside to having oily skin is we tend to age better because of all the natural oil we have. Makeup is our common enemy though
4208 2018-10-08 16:46:02 Agreed it's not either/or, and political opinion counts: taking social consent from FF companies & divestment counts. But in the spinach tart conversation from @climategeorge, it's likely that everyone at that dinner would say "Yes, the oil companies, aren't they awful?"

4210 2018-10-08 16:45:47 @ThisisLukeOwen You're not taking cod liver oil again are you? You looked different in the latest news episode, or is it just the lighting in the new studio.
4211 2018-10-08 16:45:47 As the weather gets colder, I tend to lean more to using Shea butter than coconut oil. More sugar scrubs. Lip protection.

4214 2018-10-08 16:45:40 I like to season it with black pepper and mustard and I just sorta spread it all around and while I’m doing that I start to heat up the pan with olive oil for about 3 minutes and then I put the pieces in the pan

4232 2018-10-08 16:43:34 I did a few things differently. I didn’t use quite as much oil as it asks forI think I used maybe a little more than 1/8th of a cup. I also used chilli oil and garlic oil combined to make the 1/8th of an oil. I also didn’t use as much garlic

4249 2018-10-08 16:42:01 I use olive oil and red curry paste for mine, also add a bit of rosemary. *grabs the maple syrup and drips some on lion's tongue*
4250 2018-10-08 16:41:51 I got an oil change and got a new vacuum so I feel like I’m putting this day off to good use lol
4251 2018-10-08 16:41:50 Lol! Sell it, snake oil man!
4252 2018-10-08 16:41:50 There are things EVERY industry can do to help, including ours. Suggesting that film could do a lot in no way absolves the blame on Bezos and the oil companies and the government. 
I am honestly really shocked you'd try to spin what I said that way.
And I'm done.
4253 2018-10-08 16:41:45 cooking oil $25 beware
4254 2018-10-08 16:41:45 By the end of the month be ready for fuel scarcity. Oil prices are raising same with subsidies.
4255 2018-10-08 16:41:42 i am inclined to think manchen is re-elected but it will be a lot closer than polls have suggested. as for Heitkamp she may have helped herself.but i think big thing is do the native americans in nd come out for her despite her siding with oil companys.they are group many forget
4256 2018-10-08 16:41:34 I hear the Paris Accord had the force of law and without it Exxon can now dump oil literally on your backyard and your prized petunias and your dog.

Also "stupid coal"? You realize pro-industry tends to be heavily conservative right? You're not disproving my point at all.
4257 2018-10-08 16:41:26 I got an oil change and new tires. I’m whippin in a bad bitch now
4258 2018-10-08 16:41:14 Sliced leek (inch thick) blanche in simmering veg stock, add chick peas long enough to warm them up, take out with slotted spoon, olive oil, lemon juice and honey dressing, fridge cold feta crumbled on top just before serving... 
4259 2018-10-08 16:41:07 @AMAG_Media Hi Amag Team, I have Seat Leon TGI 2018 (CPWA), it asked me for a litre of oil. Which type of oil I should use? What type of oil my engine drunk when it left the factory? Kind regards
4260 2018-10-08 16:40:59 2 litres of cooking oil was going for $17 today. And no service station in chitungwiza with fuel
4261 2018-10-08 16:40:47 Super easy actually! I sliced these once, lengthwise, toss in enough olive oil to coat, dried herbs, pepper, lay in 1 layer on a foil-lined baking pan, non-skin side down 25-30min. Flip over to skin side, roast another 7-10min. 375-400 degrees depending on your oven.
4262 2018-10-08 16:40:45 Oil goes in somewhere mmm
4263 2018-10-08 16:40:42 Just when you think gas prices are going down , the big oil companies turn right around and punch you in the wiener
4264 2018-10-08 16:40:32 I’m hitting the gas and unleashing my constitutional concealed carry rights.
4265 2018-10-08 16:40:31 Oil Prices dropped to around $83 a barrel, pressured by expectations that some Iranian oil exports will keep flowing after the U.S. re-imposes sanctions, easing a strain on supplies.
4266 2018-10-08 16:40:30 The yanks are well know for stealing other peoples property.  American for example from the indigenous population.  Libyan Gold, Ukraine Gold, 40% of Iraq Oil. Still on the list, the rare earth minerials in Afganistan and North Korea, NOT got that yet !!!

4272 2018-10-08 16:40:03 also their direct ties to the oil industry helps fund the ignorance of the climate change deniers. we should make new speech impediments and trump derangement syndrome symptoms of climate change. might change some minds.
4273 2018-10-08 16:40:03 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

4280 2018-10-08 16:39:06 That’s fine. And when it’s profitable to do so then the private sector will build it. It makes no sense to sell dirty expensive oil at these low prices.

4290 2018-10-08 16:38:02 Giant oil refinery explosion and CBC Facebook page commenters are hoping gas doesn't go up. I am hoping everyone is safe. Some people have no common decency.
4291 2018-10-08 16:37:50 On Fox Biz News @ 2:40. Tune in. Talking oil prices (the risk is that it moves higher) and stocks (the risk is this corrective bout has more to run).  Neither run as a base case to undermine our constructive view of the economy and equity market.
4292 2018-10-08 16:37:45 I used almond oil on my skin today instead of Cetaphil and I smell just like those sugar pecans they sell in the river walk
4293 2018-10-08 16:37:45 Yum. Anything special on them or just oil and so&ppl?
4294 2018-10-08 16:37:38 Much depends on Mid-Terms. Geopolitics - Middle East - oil price - EU problems and perhaps even Brexit negotiations! China and trade war - US treasury yields and US corporate season. Think market does look stretched and struggling. Europe and Asian mkts weak- US to follow.
4295 2018-10-08 16:37:28 I do love you...
4296 2018-10-08 16:37:25 Brent crude oil is priced at $83.33/bbl. The price is headed towards $90, with Russia & OPEC not making up for the 500m-1 million barrel per day supply shortfalls. The US probably could not have picked a worse time to sanction Iran's oil exports- JPMorgan as reported in Barron's
4297 2018-10-08 16:37:19 they should just make pods filled with cpd oil, basically reduces stress, anxiety, and depression and you can still blow “fat clouds” 
4298 2018-10-08 16:37:11 ANDY. so does my oil change but i got you to do it cause I’m lazy (:
4299 2018-10-08 16:36:54 Sigh. I think things through; I understand the consequences. Perhaps that's why I could spot the Yes/SNP lies in the "We'll keep the £ and have a CU!" or "We'll remain in the EU; we don't have to apply!" or "Oil is a bonus, not a basis!". Perhaps you should think those through?
4300 2018-10-08 16:36:52 The Knights Templar own all the gold. National Treasure was a documentary! Benghazi has nothing to do with a man named Ben Gahzi! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4301 2018-10-08 16:36:25 I also LITERALLY place the blame on government and oil companies. My industry has a LOT of money in it, some of which could be used to help in a crisis. I'm really insulted you'd mischaracterize what I'm saying.

4303 2018-10-08 16:36:20 Oil and gas releases continue despite North Sea safety improvements
4304 2018-10-08 16:36:20 Sir the fuel prices are tied to brent crude futures.  During CONG rule, the fuel was subsidised, but govt issued OIL bonds to the tune of Rs.130,000 crores, which is debt on the next generation.  We are ready to pay high price instead of heaping debt on the next Generation.

4307 2018-10-08 16:35:58 However, a US government official said on Friday that the country could consider exemptions for nations that have already shown efforts to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
4308 2018-10-08 16:35:57 If dem nor do clean up, we complain. When dem raise money to do the clean up, even if na for re-election, we complain. ABI na northern Nigeria dey feel the impact of the oil spill?
4309 2018-10-08 16:35:50 US sanctions will target Iran’s crude oil exports from Nov. 4, and Washington has been putting pressure on governments and companies worldwide to cut their imports to zero.
4310 2018-10-08 16:35:46 Griddled courgettes, dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest and honey, thinly sliced chilli, feta. Hmmm
4311 2018-10-08 16:35:45 The player was courtino £142 million. And no we didn’t spend it. Oh and regarding your success prior to your investment. The same could be said about bloody hull. But they did get oil money.
  I do remember you being in the third division tho.
4312 2018-10-08 16:35:43 International benchmark Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were at $83.26/bbl at 0352 GMT, down 90c, or 1.1%, from their last close

4314 2018-10-08 16:35:36 Why is there not a tariff on imported oil for there upstream carbon footprint. Why is there not tariffs for every product imported into Canada from countries that do not meet our environmental standards. What we don’t produce others will and we have no control over their standard
4315 2018-10-08 16:35:34 Brent crude oil prices fell more than 1% on Monday after Washington said it may grant waivers to sanctions against Iran’s oil exports next month, and as Saudi Arabia was said to be replacing any potential shortfall from Iran
4316 2018-10-08 16:35:33 Im no fan of theirs either but Trump is selling snake oil and you bought a case of it.

4323 2018-10-08 16:35:03 #AfricanLivesMatter I am such an optimist I believe the bond is really 1:1 with USD , that the price of cooking oil&other basic necessities is normal ;the cost of living affordable for ordinary folk&blah blah blah. BUT I am not a fool who mistakes a long fuel line for parked cars
4324 2018-10-08 16:34:56 Ok im just gonna continue to go crazy here lol... make a pesto sauce (  basil, olive oil, parm cheese  and blend . It’s good on chicken and also as a sauce on pasta with some chicken and olives
4325 2018-10-08 16:34:55 Good luck getting the industrialized world to stop the sheer volume of carbon and oil production. Even the march of China going to cleaner energies isn't saving us.

4330 2018-10-08 16:34:41 Actually we could have done it. But the Guardian was,and is, busy supporting the policies for continued oil extraction by warring on the peoples in the Middle East and make nuclear winter a growing threat.
4331 2018-10-08 16:34:28 The Dutch Labour MEP actually has a point, current corporation tax regime is outdated. It was created when the big giants were oil companies, banks or industrial conglomerates and now we have Google, Facebook etc deriving income and barely paying any taxes.
4332 2018-10-08 16:34:21 Sept 28th-30th 2018. 2 day of fresh oil  ( And it shall come to pass) 29th evening 6:30pm

4335 2018-10-08 16:34:18 Chevron just spent $4 million to try to convince our county that we need more oil wells.
4336 2018-10-08 16:33:59 Do you and the rest of Scotland not pay tax?  Oil pumped out of Scotland for 40 + years. Where did all that money go when we have food banks? Whisky ,gin,salmon, renewables, water etc etc How does Malta cope? We don't need the Barnett formula. #thickasmince
4337 2018-10-08 16:33:35 Sometimes I think about the fact that I've never bothered to learn how to change my own oil but I've sure as hell seen every Nic Cage movie at least once
4338 2018-10-08 16:33:32 I heard that tee tree oil is good for hair, my dumb self poured the whole bottle on! Now my head smells like a Christmas tree 
4339 2018-10-08 16:33:32 Situation at Irving Oil refinery fire in Saint John- nearly all refd products go to US.

4341 2018-10-08 16:33:18 A major explosion and fire at Canada’s largest oil refinery, this incidence shows how woeful local news coverage is in Saint John. Didn’t know anything about even though we live less that 5km from site. Local Media should be fully ashamed of lack of local news coverage.
4342 2018-10-08 16:33:11 Idk who needs this out there

4347 2018-10-08 16:32:27 @nelsonchamisa @edmnangagwa @matigary I feel we shld start looking at why th price of bread,sugar,cooking oil & fuel are rising & not the price of mealie meal its becoz we hve enough maize in stock as fo now. So what can we do 2 reduce th prices is we need 2 grow mo wheat & soya
4348 2018-10-08 16:32:19 I wonder why there's so much noise abt few project's PMB is executing if PDP had spent 10% of oil boom on them. A thief thinks abt what to steal, while clueless man dont knw what to do, he doesn't even knw what and how to steal.

4351 2018-10-08 16:32:03 ACtually, the consequences have been massive. Read the report that just cam our of @IPCC_CH Our gov't was taken hostage by oil money and civilization may not survive the next century as a result.
4352 2018-10-08 16:32:02 mass scale renewable energy so oil strategy is irrelevant to decision making?
4353 2018-10-08 16:32:02 @UniversalToyota Seriously...what is the point of an appointment if a 20 min oil change takes 2 hours. Last time I bring a vehicle here...
4354 2018-10-08 16:31:57 Your plan won't alter global GHG levels or global temps. If it did many more would support it. You're forcing CDNs to lower their CO2 output in return for producing oil/gas, almost all of which goes to USA, a nation with no such burden. U need a better plan.
4355 2018-10-08 16:31:49 The first time I saw those large, pink things around the necks of women, I thought they were some kind of new device for EPA to use to soak up oil spills.

Instead we are voting on new oil wells.

4377 2018-10-08 16:30:09 hate getting my oil changed because i know i need lots of maintenance on my car but just give me the damn oil and free car wash.. thanks

4380 2018-10-08 16:29:55 Given the cost of shipping that discount would put us into a loss position. So that isn't likely to happen. 

Not to mention that we need to dramatically decrease oil consumption now, to avoid catastrophic climate change in 2040.
4381 2018-10-08 16:29:53 Broccoli! Pinch of salt, pepper and a dash of oil! Cook however; cover and microwave, place in/oven safe dish (or simply in foil for that matter)  and bake; sautee on the stovetop.

4384 2018-10-08 16:29:40 Don’t forget that you want the industrialized nations to give you 40 trillion dollars to spend in the next 16 years. Sense you are not going to get the money from the US that only leaves the EU and Canada. Maybe the Dutch will give you their oil money.

4387 2018-10-08 16:29:28 Study after study shows we need to curb our oil & gas use immediately if we even want a chance of mitigating climate change.

We don't neee more fracking rigs, least of all near schools. We already have plenty of within half a mile of them and medical centers.

Was there no religious,  tribal n ethnic crises?What did they do about d economy?They were just lucky the oil prices were up!

4403 2018-10-08 16:28:03 How’s the scent? Most beard oils I’ve tried smell like castor oil.
4404 2018-10-08 16:28:02 Yes cooking oil is available on twitter & newspapers!!
4405 2018-10-08 16:28:00 Agree.  Due to the relentless POTUS trade-war with China, $YUAN is finally catching up to the tariffs reality

$YUAN is not only important to the Chinese-related equities, but also all commodities, especially Metals and Oil, like $GOLD & $Silver and $USOil

4461 2018-10-08 16:23:00 Used engine oil typically is re-refined and used to make heating oil, asphalt and other petroleum-based products. It also helps cut down waste by being reused in the oil and petroleum refinery industry.  --- this from ask google --

4472 2018-10-08 16:21:51 Let’s assume Buhari influences Saudi Arabia to cut its input. Did he influence the American govt to impose sanctions on Iran? America, China and India used to be the largest purchasers of oil, America started frocking and produced oil. It had deals with China and India who cut
4473 2018-10-08 16:21:50 No one will be there to buy their oil when the planet's population is greatly diminished. Trump, Putin and XI will also likely be dead by 2040.

4507 2018-10-08 16:19:29 Correction, oil prices had begun to steadily decline, it was not just a crash. Non-oil sector grew but in relation to imports vs exports we were still heavily reliant on oil dollars to keep our economy stable.

4559 2018-10-08 16:15:53 The battle between Europe, USA against China is stealing away our peace in Africa, particularly in South Africa. Oil price, value of the currency is manipulated to frustrate us so that we become more arrogant against our government.
4560 2018-10-08 16:15:49 my tech-based goals of 2019 are to push the "on" button on my oil diffuser more often I'm 100% stressed 100% of the time.
4561 2018-10-08 16:15:46 I really wish someone would take my car to get an oil change and looked at  I hate doing it.
4562 2018-10-08 16:15:43 do you think olive oil would work?? that’s the only oil i have
4563 2018-10-08 16:15:35 Ewww that’s terrible!! Bring an oil diffuser to class with eucalyptus lol
4564 2018-10-08 16:15:26 Oil change, grocery shopping, and filled the car up for the week...goodbye bank account
4565 2018-10-08 16:15:24 Bullshit. You know what would be helpful? About ten pounds of C4 in every oil refinery from here to Saudi. But nobody's gonna do a goddamn thing to even slightly disrupt their convenience and their lifestyles. Humans might survive but this civilization is fucked.

4567 2018-10-08 16:15:17 Yes, but who is going to put a fee on carbon or resources at the point of extraction if not government? If I pump a barrel of oil out of the ground, who am I supposed to pay the tax to, if not government? And if it's not government imposing that tax, then why should I pay it?
4568 2018-10-08 16:15:15 I need gas & an oil change how tf imma get to Atlanta
4569 2018-10-08 16:15:03 What's in the cookie? Palm oil gives me trouble, but I don't get hives. Keep benadryl and phone close by.
4570 2018-10-08 16:15:02 Well a pizza guy loses a job while people that make the technology to deliver pizzas w/o human get jobs and much better paying jobs. New tech always displaced some at first but opens new jobs. Whale oil replaced by kerosene meant no whalers but opened work for kerosene production

4579 2018-10-08 16:14:29 ah ahn! Shebi oil prices crashed in mid-2015 and the Non-oil Sector was still growing, keeping the economy afloat - It's important to note that oil prices had stabilised at record lows but non-oil GDP was still growing at an of average 3.5%
4580 2018-10-08 16:14:26 Ghana has two choices around oil: export it as crude or use it to transform our economy, through value-added activities (refining), and using it to create assets rather than to consume, and accrue debt. @NAkufoAddo

4583 2018-10-08 16:14:06 Again, your recollection of history is faulty.

Carter's main problem was the Iranian hostages. And while he did a relatively good job of keeping them alive and securing their release, voters were weary of that, oil shortages (which were probably manufactured)..
4584 2018-10-08 16:14:01 I'm telling you, Wall Street is going to run Cryptos up to the the biggest asset bubble the world has ever seen. 

Everything they've ever touched this has happened to- stocks, tech, housing, Oil, metals.
4585 2018-10-08 16:14:00 Naw justice is coming. This is the stupidest civilization to ever live! You don’t use clean energy or more advanced technology for the sake of burning oil to serve a few of your rich. Seriously, the people in power today have to be a the weakest link in all human history.
4586 2018-10-08 16:13:59 Utterly fatuous argument. 

47 years so far - will still be there for another 50 years. And is only 1 revenue stream to Scotland. You also seem to assume the ScotGov would copy UK Gov tax regime on the oil companies.  Burdensome welfare state - like Trident?

4590 2018-10-08 16:13:20 And as far as research goes, if more people did research on Trump before they pulled that level for him and elected a known sexual assailant, racist, criminal, thief, huckster, grifter, snake oil salesman, idiot, draft dodging, huge motherfucking liar... Well, connect the dots.
4591 2018-10-08 16:13:16 Everything you learned about studying in high school, throw that out of the window. Do not spend more than 2 hours straight without taking a 10-15 min break. Eat energy foods & put classical music on in the background. If you can get some eucalyptus oil this helps as well.
4592 2018-10-08 16:13:04 Oil companies are destroying the planet in real time. Hope you haven’t accepted any money from them.
4593 2018-10-08 16:13:03 Wheels finally coming off the once mighty @SundayTimesZA. The day I read their half-baked story on Minister @DrZweliMkhize and Afric Oil, it became undeniable that Tiso Blackstar is available as a propaganda machine to the connected.

4600 2018-10-08 16:12:25 If we continue with the "MeToo" fallacy, the long-term result will be that men and women will end up like water and oil. If that's what the world wants, go ahead. But I just remind you, there are always people who use their brains.
4601 2018-10-08 16:12:22 I can confidently tell you that the money Nigeria lose to procurement is more than what we lose to oil bunkers and ghost workers joined together. Its a shame that @MBuhari and @APCNigeria @APCUKingdom with all there shout about corruption have done nothing to stop it.

4603 2018-10-08 16:12:09 I'll mention the obvious - water. Exercise. Sunlight/Vitamin D. Buy the highest quality extra virgin olive oil you can afford. Massage it into the 'pain' area - watch what happens. This oil also kills cancer cells - powerful.  Then research: Middle East diet
4604 2018-10-08 16:12:06 Our taxi driver in Milan told us Merkel made a deal - migrants for oil. That has backfired big time. She's lost support all over the EU.
4605 2018-10-08 16:12:05 I’m glad you have some investments in renewables but to compare yourself against @exxonmobil and other oil companies to seem better than them is misleading because none of your peers are well regarded for investing in renewables. Is it done to appear like you care?

4638 2018-10-08 16:09:38 it's literally massaged. like kale is not enough anymore, apparently massaging it in for example, oil and vinegar for a kale salad, or massaging avocado into it is the new normal.

4644 2018-10-08 16:09:13 Was. The pipeline was cancelled, and only die-hards and vote-grubbing politicians believe it'll be resurrected what with the current price of oil, projected declining demand, and pipelines like Trans-Mountain and Keystone XL being much further along approval processes.

4650 2018-10-08 16:08:57 Sad to admit...my first thought when I heard the news re the Saint John oil refinery explosion today was ...I wonder who deliberately did this.
4651 2018-10-08 16:08:52 Did the W Bush administration do anything other than take down whitehouse solar panels and give the oil & gas energy everything, like current administration?

4653 2018-10-08 16:08:30 Tweet to automobile companies. Hello,  have you invented or trying to invent any duet engine car that can run by oil and electric both???  If you not yet invent,  start to find it. It may be a UNIQUE or dream car.
4654 2018-10-08 16:08:29 Horizon’s Saint John Regional Hospital is on high alert and prepared to

4657 2018-10-08 16:08:17 Clean is not an appropriate word to use when describing any oil product in the world.  That's like calling Tzeporah fluffy.

4660 2018-10-08 16:08:01 Oil & Gas is *INHERENTLY* dangerous. Combine that with *profit motive above all else*, *lowest cost design and construction*, *short-term thinking*, *cultures of complacency*, and we get “normal accidents”.

It’s a crime that all this pollution, harm & destruction is normalized.

4671 2018-10-08 16:06:55 @elonmusk Your stupid self-destructive behavior is the single biggest risk to T*. Not big oil. You are unable to do what's in the best interest of T* and should step down or be fired. You wasted hundreds of millions on a failed assembly line that was your brainchild. #elonschmuck
4672 2018-10-08 16:06:48 No, we need to do nothing but let the market figure out how to best supply the cheapest energy.  If that's renewables or fission (or even fusion), great.  If that's coal and oil, that's great too.  The path of technology is not predictable, and efforts to direct it are wasted $.

Put figures in those sectors didn't translate to realizing of d funds. Barrel of oil has been $75-$80 since d beginning of this year

4695 2018-10-08 16:04:42 You Tories sold off The Royal Mail, BT, Electricity, Gas, Water in England and are gradually selling of the NHS down there too, to name but a few. You've also given away rights to oil, gas, and renewables to your business cronies for a song. So wind it in and pipe down.

4711 2018-10-08 16:03:20 The reason the oil industry is NOT lobbying against global warming is that the owners of the oil industry is the same people who want global government through UN Agenda 2030 which is motivated by global warming?

4770 2018-10-08 16:00:05 I see it - the change correlation is even more clear. But, word is they're getting free passes from US sanctions to buy Iranian oil and apparently also Russian military hardware. So the Brent price may not be the best to gauge what India's energy costs will be going forward.

4784 2018-10-08 15:58:47 Most of our planet is water .which would mean plankton. Which would mean there is a protective layer of oil between us and the center of the earth acting as a coolant to keep the planet cool .

4787 2018-10-08 15:58:29 trump will do his usual snake oil sales pitch on him to manipulate him to be his flying monkey.  If he feels that doesn't work he will send somebody else to push Rosenstein out and claim "Gee I don't know what happened"
4788 2018-10-08 15:58:19 This 24k oil smell so good bruh like a perfect blend of weed smell and a hint of peach 
4789 2018-10-08 15:58:15 Finally got my oil changed
4790 2018-10-08 15:58:12 My global warming thought....
We all no that oil keeps our cars from overheating ....keep that in mind.....
Now, oil is made from dead plankton that sink to the bottom and are pressed between rock and water pressure and over billions of years oil is the end product.

4794 2018-10-08 15:57:54 Hi Ireland, here is a lifehack: take a slice of white bread, soak it in canola oil and sugar, wring it out and eat. Tastes just like Krispy Kreme!
4795 2018-10-08 15:57:53 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on it's board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.

4810 2018-10-08 15:56:50 Our Country will be in big trouble in a few years if we don’t focus on other exports. Oil price went down for a few years and things went south. What will happen when price and demand goes down forever?
4811 2018-10-08 15:56:50 I need to go get a oil change
4812 2018-10-08 15:56:48 One of the big things is the massive factory farming industry, particularly beef, as far as I am aware, and also palm oil production. This is where ethical consumerism and boycotts can help me thinks plus pressure on governments.
4813 2018-10-08 15:56:48 When did Lagos started experiencing boot in her revenue generation, and when was ABJ plan conceived, when ABJ was been funded with oil money OBJ deny Lagos the same oil fund for 4 years. The boot experience in Lagos started less than 12 years.

4892 2018-10-08 15:49:56 Current Canadian oil refining capacity is 1,907,600 bbl/day. Current Canadian oil consumption is 1.5 million bbl/day. So why are we a) getting gouged whenever an American refinery goes down. B) importing refined products?
4893 2018-10-08 15:49:52 Yaaaasssssssss!!! I don’t really do perfumes but if they’re oil based....IN THERE!!!
4894 2018-10-08 15:49:47 The entire society would not do a damn thing until the middle and elite class assume responsibility for what society has become. The solution? We need to reduce unemployment and manage our oil wealth better. We need education for all. And to stop politics with the above 3 things
4895 2018-10-08 15:49:46 for the past two months, i have been moisturizing with coconut oil after showers like a thanksgiving turkey with butter and i feel like God put me on this Earth to tell you all to do the same!

4910 2018-10-08 15:49:03 Canada's Largest Oil Refinery Is On Fire
 
Irving Oil says a "major incident" has occurred at its Saint John New Brunswick refinery, after reports of an explosion and fire on Monday morning.
Residents have been told to avoid the area. Nearby streets have also been closed.
4911 2018-10-08 15:48:57 Do you ingest the oil or rub it on your skin?!
4912 2018-10-08 15:48:45 Or, sautee some veggies you like in olive oil and then mix them with the pasta. :)
4913 2018-10-08 15:48:33 Argon oil- good for everyone, high in vitamin e, great for helping heal scars,eczema and dry scalp. It also contains oliec acid which promotes a healthy skin turnover; which can be gray for acne control
Avocado oil- intense hydration; lots of fatty acids, may be too hydrating
4914 2018-10-08 15:48:26 Is the oil industry lobbying against the climate change lobby?
4915 2018-10-08 15:48:12 He should explain why him and obasanjo did not share oil wells for each state

4921 2018-10-08 15:47:48 @MochrieRobbie Thank you for following.
I'd be v interested on your thoughts on the "Crowding Out" effects by North Sea oil and gas on an independent Scottish economy
Do you think lessons will have been learned from Oil and Gas boom on UK economy, crowding out other industries
4922 2018-10-08 15:47:46 Big Oil and those that lobby for Big Oil will tell you accidents will never happen, they break it down into the odds  of something ever happening...and yet here we are. 
And they want to load oil tankers continually, is seismic prone Vancouver and send tankers through the City!
4923 2018-10-08 15:47:42 I live in Texas. That is not I am hearing while “talking to quite a few on both sides”. We do not want open borders, increased oil prices, donations from Hollywood or the same cess pool that California has become. Vote Cruz!

4928 2018-10-08 15:47:29 @realDonaldTrump If you knew anything, you would know CC engaged in enslavement, theft & genocide of indigenous peoples. In modern day Indian land is being exploited for oil and other natural resources.Pipelines poisoning their land. You will not be remembered kindly either.

4933 2018-10-08 15:46:53 I felt The Irving Oil Refinery Explosion a block away from the Saint Josephs Hospital.
4934 2018-10-08 15:46:45 My stove caught fire yesterday with me cooking, I let the oil splash.. oops
4935 2018-10-08 15:46:39 Iran needs Indiian presence in that region for any covert operation. Today itself India allowed it's companies to borrow oil on loan. So India can procure oil from Iran and pay later. UPA did same for something called oil bonds which NDA is cribbing now
4936 2018-10-08 15:46:23 An oil refinery in St. John, New Brunswick exploded this morning. Details at 10 SK time w/ GX94 News.

4939 2018-10-08 15:46:01 So there was 1 incident? So no ICE cars have ever had break failure at speed? How much did an oil company pay you to tweet?
4940 2018-10-08 15:45:59 Ahhh...I think you would be right there with the Portland.

4949 2018-10-08 15:45:10 Bro, it’s not that hard to just grab the bottom. It’s the biggest alpha move in the book bro. Just show everyone you came to eat, and that a little oil is only a problem if there’s no napkins or it’s in the ocean.
4950 2018-10-08 15:44:59 shoulda got one of those oil pens before i left 
4951 2018-10-08 15:44:56 states benefit from higher oil prices...u monitor all these stats very clearly....but the bitter truth is u r such a useless fellow...can u control these benefits being in power....when u will sit in opposition then u will come to protest with your rubbish demands
4952 2018-10-08 15:44:53 The planet will have run out of oil before 2100, so chill!

4958 2018-10-08 15:44:32 Housing may get a 2nd wind if Canadian lumber price starts to recede… But don’t expect homes are coming out by similar measure. Like airlines’ fuel surcharge when oil coming down, they go to the bottomline
4959 2018-10-08 15:44:11 This person does not realize that the founders gave this responsibility to the Senate, which at the time was not elected but appointed, because they didn't trust hoi polloi.

As usual, the founders have been shown to be correct in their assessment of human nature.

4961 2018-10-08 15:43:58 Specifically, you could be having pancakes every time you're hungry instead of a sandwich because pancakes just need mix, water and some oil on the pan.
4962 2018-10-08 15:43:57 Don't need to listen to NPR story about water to know they won't mention oil spills or massive pollution of water tables by fracking-& its removal of vast quantities of water from the hydrologic cycle when the highly polluted fracking water is reinjected way below water tables.
4963 2018-10-08 15:43:57 Not if your production rate is capped, e.g. 200 units of oil per minute would be my factory capacity, until I extend my factory I can't supply the market with more oil...what I can do is enjoy the quicker turnover profits, instead of my products being stuck on a shelf for a week
4964 2018-10-08 15:43:55 I don’t think it’s remotely the same. CG runs a great system but New Pal would have big problems against Warren and several other 6A schools with athleticism. I think they will struggle to get to Lucas Oil.
4965 2018-10-08 15:43:53 This creep should be selling snake oil. Nothing he says is true. Nothing. The sooner he is out of power, the oh so much better we’ll be.

4968 2018-10-08 15:43:43 The early predictions were based around the end of global resources such as oil, coal etc. and not just climate based. Erlich suggested that the human population would grow to such a size that we would have stripped the earth bare and would be starved into extinction.

4974 2018-10-08 15:42:59 @ArcelorMittal_D Hi Dofasco....I just saw news out of Saint John about an explosion at the Irving Oil refinery there...I'm just wondering if, due to that news, you guys will do some safety checks there, just to make sure things are okay? o.o
4975 2018-10-08 15:42:59 The significance of the pick up on the prairies is huge. A work horse in the oil patch, a lifeline for most Alberta farmers since the 30's, a cultural icon to the development of our great province
4976 2018-10-08 15:42:57 That was the Portland I think Heid. Much more soluble gas in the Kimmeridge which propells the Oil to Surface. That's why the Kimmeridge free flows. And That's why she's called The #GatwickGusher !

4984 2018-10-08 15:42:36 How the former govt was borrowing to pay salaries despite inheriting buoyant foreign reserves/ECA with very high crude oil price and how the present government is borrowing to build infrastructure despite inheriting very low foreign reserves/ECA with very low crude oil price.

4990 2018-10-08 15:42:15 Same, sadly, I have no choice but to oil heat my home.  What other options do I have that won't cripple me financially?  I would love to do my part and not rely on fossil fuels as much, but we have no other cheap alternative options for us that live in cold climates.
4991 2018-10-08 15:42:06 Go voir CCV au ciné 
4992 2018-10-08 15:42:05 A few countries have decided to trade oil in Euros/Yuan
They seem to get bombed a lot by the US
4993 2018-10-08 15:42:03 my skin is so dry even coconut oil is not enough...
4994 2018-10-08 15:42:00 If i put cbd oil on my wifi router will the internet run faster?
4995 2018-10-08 15:41:38 Rising CoP won't push oil over $250/bbl for several decades, and that's where the big tradeoffs would make sense.  Coal will likely last considerably longer.  By then, renewables like biofuels may actually be viable alternatives, but OECD carbon taxes are pointless today.
4996 2018-10-08 15:41:36 Just put eggs in my hair?  I was looking at coconut oil or avocado oil too. It said they make it hydrated.
4997 2018-10-08 15:41:32 Kavanagh's appt. will speed up the end of the world by protecting oil distilleries which are responsible for earth's destruction..
4998 2018-10-08 15:41:31 U are not getting the analysis of these dollar. Wat are things we export that will boost the $. Leave oil alone. Tell me other resources, did u know our import is backed by wat we get from oil revenue
4999 2018-10-08 15:41:23 Minestrone. 1 onion, 1 carrot, a potato, few broad beans, few broccoli florets, few French beans,a bit of shredded cabbage - sweat all in order (1 min between each) in olive oil+butter. Add 1 tin org toms+a few broken sticks of spaghetti+a little veg stock. Simmer 25mins. Season.
5000 2018-10-08 15:41:19 But they have done nothing to stop it. It almost makes them worse. Democratic Party went back on its pledge and started taking money from fossil fuel companies this summer. They smile at you & pay lip service to global warming, but that oil blood money is to important to give up
5001 2018-10-08 15:41:18 No shit Sherlock. I'm talking about oil for energy.

5005 2018-10-08 15:41:13 Political forces are aligned on the more/less taxes axis. Oil companies have put all their weight against taxes. Oil companies are not equipped to defend against an orthogonal attack on their privilege to do business. Hurt the enemy where it is weakest.

5017 2018-10-08 15:40:27 1/ US equities have been fueled by growth narrative

Some of it has been self-referential asset price increases (of households) over income

-Oil over $80
-US10yr over 3.2%
-PAST tax cuts raised EXPECTATIONS of earnings

BUT NOW
Rising prices + rates become taxes on growth...
5018 2018-10-08 15:40:20 Zi think Space Aliens (Arabs, Japanese, English, Nordics, etc.) love oil to free dead souls (remember fossil fuels are compacted fossils underground). Instead of trying to burn them all at once, we should conserve oil reserves for heat. Climate Science is real.
5019 2018-10-08 15:40:19 In south africa yu are right...we use cooking oil
5020 2018-10-08 15:40:18 Yes, you are wrong. It’s not anymore #data, now #api is the new #oil.
5021 2018-10-08 15:40:16 There is one company “Tesla” which is making those far reaching changes as we tweet! Why are governments not rushing to advance the changes this company is making? OH WAIT ! OIL RULES ALL!
5022 2018-10-08 15:40:12 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
5023 2018-10-08 15:40:04 Related: you don't have to refrigerate oil-and-vinegar-based dressings after you open the bottle.  If you do, you get a gross congealed glop.
5024 2018-10-08 15:39:58 CBD oil has definitely helped with a frozen shoulder I’ve been suffering wth for the past few months.  And I used cannabis in place of opioids post hernia surgery and it worked like a charm!  Nearly the same level of pain relief compared to Oxy, and I wasn’t a drooling mess!
5025 2018-10-08 15:39:56 As an oil developer, you have made 100 posts against #carbontax. However, anyone paying attention was happy to see the Nobel prize on this topic today!!!:
“the most efficient remedy for problems caused by greenhouse gases is a global scheme of universally imposed carbon taxes.”
5026 2018-10-08 15:39:55 I hope people are staying away from that fire at the oil refinery! Couple pics ain’t worth getting blown up for!
5027 2018-10-08 15:39:54 Like it’s hard not to feel screwed with climate change. Even if I go vegan, almost every product has palm oil in it nowadays. All the supermarket food is brought in by means of boat, plane and truck. Just the fact you buy orange juice contributed to climate change
5028 2018-10-08 15:39:49 cera ve oil control face wash, witch hazel, tea tree oil, aloevera, oatmeal scrubs, and a lot of water
5029 2018-10-08 15:39:38 This lesson is great and I think about it now with all my sharesys..
5030 2018-10-08 15:39:33 Hmm, yep sounds daft , so fuck it indy it is , its not like we wont need a navy , customs boats , ferries etc to replace those orders.

Norway , same population as Scotland , largest shipyard industry in Europe , order books full for 20 years almost. Did I mention oil fund tae?
5031 2018-10-08 15:39:33 For the record, I have south Sudanese from when I saw one of them celebrating that "Kenya has eventually gone to war against each other ' in 2007, I hate how they want to look like the boss while in the midst of us,  just because they have oil.
5032 2018-10-08 15:39:20 @eddiemair @lbc what’s the point of talking to is about climate change. The technology has been around for about 50yrs but as there’s shit loads of money to be made out of oil not one Government is gonna change it. Simple
5033 2018-10-08 15:39:15 Meeee! In a nutshell. Im getting there. I have been watching top 8s with a more understanding and tokido plays one of the most honest neutrals i ever seen. But even HE throws in the random demon flip shenanigans here and there. Hell, oil king woke up ex mixered against fuudo alot

5036 2018-10-08 15:39:06 if tea tree oil was a song, it’d be “Knuck If You Buck.”
5037 2018-10-08 15:39:02 Stop issuing threats and no Muslim country is giving free oil.
5038 2018-10-08 15:38:53 It is other way around. Muslims are alive in return for oil. Otherwise, pakistan will become 100% hindu
5039 2018-10-08 15:38:52 Continue :--  I also mentioned it at  that time. If oil prices go up OPEC  countries became benefited and if it (oil price) go down oil importing countries became sufferers.  So, no one don't want to became looser.
5040 2018-10-08 15:38:51 Oil is produced by oil industry workers. And traders sell. It looks like this: I baked bread and gave it to someone else’s uncle. Which says: "Today, the price of your bread will be low, because your neighbors have some bread!" Ha ha ha!
5041 2018-10-08 15:38:48 Clove oil really works for tooth pain. Helps until you get to the dentist.

5045 2018-10-08 15:38:33 Resources aye said, oil is only one Scotland’s finance sector alone is worth over a trillion we also have tourism, fishing,agriculture,gaming,whisky and drinks industries, biggest potential in the Eu regarding renewables, sciences, just to a few not even mentioned oil & gas.
5046 2018-10-08 15:38:28 yea  ppl usually use castor/argan oil for hair right but i guess why not huHu yg penting i baca kena hydrate scalp, sejak pakai diane + rosehip tu memang kurang la rambut i bertebaran kat lantai hshshs kena  jaga la shampoo + conditioner u from sls, silicones & parabens
5047 2018-10-08 15:38:25 I live in oil country. As long as there is a market for fossil fuels it will continue to be produced. Without a change in demand nothing will happen.

Too many people blame the industry as they ride in their cars to their Natural Gas heated home powered with coal electricity.
5048 2018-10-08 15:38:21 And the many others. No oil left by year 2000. The earth can't sustain 7 billion people. It goes on & on.
5049 2018-10-08 15:38:21 Thinking about the people affected by today's events at the Irving Oil refinery in @cityofsaintjohn
5050 2018-10-08 15:38:13 The soap that started it all: Dirtybird Energy. Created with a base of sustainably sourced coconut and palm oils and infused with peppermint oil and caffeine, there is no better way to start your day.
5051 2018-10-08 15:38:12 ทำไมคุณโง่จังวะ!   ทำไมต้องเลือกรักคนที่เค้าไม่รักเรา เกลียดวะ เกลียดตัวเอง!!!!!!!!
5052 2018-10-08 15:38:08 uhh i should really invest in some cbd oil to replace the 2+ Advil i have to take everyday lmao
5053 2018-10-08 15:38:06 Hilarious.
5054 2018-10-08 15:38:04 Genios cerraron la vía en un feriado Puyo-Tena... Por unos ciclistas disminuyendo el turismo 
5055 2018-10-08 15:37:53 ルーラが言ってた
OILって3回書いて点を打つと音がサザエさんっぽくなるって
5056 2018-10-08 15:37:51 The Oil man in me wishes to extend to all the managers and staff at the Refinery in St. John a SOLDER ON message.We spend years developing contingency plans that no one every wants to implement.Keep the faith  keep the focus and work the problem! #HSE
5057 2018-10-08 15:37:49 #vanish  isn't that good . I have a 20 year old oil stain that won't come out #tippingpoint
5058 2018-10-08 15:37:49 แหมๆๆๆๆ แม่สาวน้อยยยยย
5059 2018-10-08 15:37:44 Lol it's actually oceans and oil
5060 2018-10-08 15:37:43 야 말하는 사람이 알겠냐 듣는 사람이 알지
5061 2018-10-08 15:37:35 Ask your arab masters to stop giving investment and then you will see what will happen. Arabs are giving free oil to India, not other way around.
5062 2018-10-08 15:37:27 Life lessons/reminders while waiting for my cars oil change:
1 - life is short, you never know how much time you have on Earth
2 - how many things do we make such a big deal out of that are minuscule in the grand scheme of things?
Makes me wonder what God is up to this morning 
5063 2018-10-08 15:37:24 It's all about the money to #Governments Uk Gov stopped all investment in renewable energy when they found a ton of oil in Scotland. 
We can power everything by harnessing the tide which is always there but don't...Money always talks!!
5064 2018-10-08 15:37:22 Congratulations to Ellen H. for winning the Go Green email drawing for a free oil change in September!
5065 2018-10-08 15:37:15 It isn't the oil, though, it is the arms. If you look at U.S. imports of oil, the Saudis don't count much. "In October 2017, U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia stood at 582,000 bpd—the lowest level since November 1987." Say Trump suddenly liked Iran: we could easily replace S.A. oil.
5066 2018-10-08 15:37:09 Because #Supreme leaders are still forcing us to use oil and other #primitive #fossilFuels when we have many green alternative solutions including #solar and other #freeEnergy options but it doesn’t support the #Rockefeller’s #endeavors ruling over the #globe with other #bankers
5067 2018-10-08 15:37:00 So technicaly pure drop is not produced localy they import even the packaging. So what do they do with the crude oil
5068 2018-10-08 15:36:52 This country was founded by dangerous men.
If they were not dangerous they would never have been able to fight off the dirty British. 
So men out there need to start behaving like men again Stand up for what you believe.
Get out there change your own oil & chop some wood be a man

5071 2018-10-08 15:36:39 You need to look up a YouTube tutorial bc they gouged you. Synthetic oil?
5072 2018-10-08 15:36:23 Oil prices may touch $100/ barral soon

5075 2018-10-08 15:36:03 So there was an explosion at the Irving Oil Refinery and a fire started along with it in the same area. Thoughts go out to the first responders attempting to combat it. #IrvingOilFire
5076 2018-10-08 15:35:54 おやすみなさい(-_-)zzz
5077 2018-10-08 15:35:51 Dogs also have an endo-cannabinoid system. Cannabis oil would work on dogs too.
5078 2018-10-08 15:35:50 I need a oil change plug or need to figure out how to do it myself cause this shxt ain't cheap
5079 2018-10-08 15:35:49 I really have to get my oil changed but I’ve been putting it off bc the last time I went I was stuck in my car while the male employees hit on me and made me very umcomfy so I’m stressed and scared to go again. 

I love being a woman everything is so easy and uncomplicated!!
5080 2018-10-08 15:35:48 D ko sure pila na in peso, pero 50 mls rajud sya Wlaj. Tipid2 jud ani :)) In theory pwd daw idungan ang Vit C ug Niacinamide, pero naa dghan mubreakout so mas maayo d nalang to be on the safe side. Niacinamide kay good for skin elasticity and controls oil. VC kay brightens skin
5081 2018-10-08 15:35:47 nah,, just old men with oil/gas and cola money to line congressional pockets.

all those oil spills and nothing changed.
5082 2018-10-08 15:35:32 That statement is not even an assurance rather it only fuels the panic buying coz the RBZ ichapa mari for cooking oil iko kusina madrugs chaiwo. I need to go buy cooking oil
5083 2018-10-08 15:35:31 tall see those photos of jimin? yeah i’m gonna paint him in oil this winter break and it’s gonna be BEAUTIFUL
5084 2018-10-08 15:35:22 Both CBD oil and medical marijuana are in PA. Every brand is not created equal. Some are superior, but others are inferior. Always check the ingredients.
5085 2018-10-08 15:35:12 prob a mix of both, I imagine a smaller hub in PHX but not a de-hubbing - also depends on where oil and the economy goes
5086 2018-10-08 15:35:05 But APC is even way corrupt. Is it the dollar scam or the present subsidy? How come despite the increase in oil price, the dollar still hasn't dropped? Let's not even start with their lack of respect for human life, or is it the bigotory.
5087 2018-10-08 15:35:02 But its not, it started around the same time UK discovered oil, pre kinnock,  the irony is that the Labour Party was co founded with 2 Scotsmen and the original manifesto contained home rule, where one went on to create the SNP. Once we were partners , can we be again next GE?
5088 2018-10-08 15:34:45 If I have a daughter best believe I’m have rem oil residue under my nails. Cause I’m be wishing a mother fucker would!!!
5089 2018-10-08 15:34:38 Maybe someone can creatively use analogical similarity to "oil bonds" of 2 lac cr..... maybe "Currency bond of 2 lac cr" or something... and explain it to common ppl.
5090 2018-10-08 15:34:36 Taking Vit D & Fish oil daily helps with depression & basic cognitive function. If you’re already on depression medicine, Fish oil further enhances the effect
5091 2018-10-08 15:34:35 can’t believe I stepped out of my house with coconut oil in my hair
5092 2018-10-08 15:34:24 It will fall hard with Oil imho. Only a matter of weeks now imho.
5093 2018-10-08 15:34:20 This should be called 'Lies about 1631'. The fact is, this Initiative is supported by a real coalition of labor unions, businesses, nonprofits, tribes, politicians and communities who all recognize that a fee on oil companies is the right thing for WA's future #YesOn1631
5094 2018-10-08 15:34:18 Thoughts and prayers for everyone affected in the #SaintJohn Irving Oil Refinery explosion.
5095 2018-10-08 15:34:14 The Saudis can reportedly pump oil for $5/bbl, and fracking has turned all sorts of new projects economically viable in just the last 15 years.  Every drop of oil recoverable for under $100/bbl is going into the atmosphere, unless you start nuking the dissenters.

5098 2018-10-08 15:33:58 how revenue from oil was judiciously used by this government and how previous government squandered revenue from oil should also be discus
5099 2018-10-08 15:33:53 I just realized how similar I am to my dog

We’re both very protective, loyal, sweet, get overexcited at the sight of their favorite person, in dire need of CBD oil...

She’s my soulmate 
5100 2018-10-08 15:33:49 First #S400 and then continue oil import from Iran. Is India taking US sanctions lightely?  Ya Pehle se  Setting Hai 
5101 2018-10-08 15:33:49 There certainly look to be some bargains around. My focus right now is #AMER where SP is down 37% YoY. But revenues are up 93%, EBITDA up 220%, cash up 70%, production up 33% and profits up 470%, and they've just struck new oil. Crazy cheap right now.
5102 2018-10-08 15:33:44 มีใครบ้างค่ะ
5103 2018-10-08 15:33:43 เยนา ผมเปียก็น่ารักเกิ๊น
5104 2018-10-08 15:33:40 YES THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED RN. Night: Take off makeup if any with micellar water, then double cleanse (I’m fanatical about cleansing), then glycolic/lactic acid toner, then 2-3 skins of hydrating toner, a few drops of marula oil/retinol in oil, and seal it all in with moisturiser
5105 2018-10-08 15:33:40 Saudis are very very hurt when oil prices go down. And they are also hurt by other forms of power that don't involve oil. They depend on the U.S. to police the region for them, cause S.A. is always a hair from exploding. Why do you think they continually try to bribe us?
5106 2018-10-08 15:33:38 Surface Wilmar’s statement is a scam.

It implies they refine/use CRUDE OIL for their Pure Gold brand. The bottle clearly states it’s REFINED SOYA BEAN OIL.

They should explain
5107 2018-10-08 15:33:37 Swallow your pride ED n negotiate please,Zim is burning to the ground..I never believed people whn thy said cooking oil 10dllrs bond,bread 1.50 bond..where is Zim heading to ?
5108 2018-10-08 15:33:19 For crying out  loud, try some mineral oil.
5109 2018-10-08 15:33:07 W're still fighting over oil when we should be building alternative.  Give the Kurds the guns and get out of the mideast, and let's put solar on some of that awful desert pavement land in Utah, Ariz,  and so on.
5110 2018-10-08 15:33:06 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
5111 2018-10-08 15:33:06 Knock ya  outcha  dats a oil spill
5112 2018-10-08 15:33:03 1. You may know more about this than I. I understand what you are saying about not much difference but there seemed to be at the time. Oil prices were an external factor, but being prudent enough to deal with it isn't.
5113 2018-10-08 15:33:00 Nope. That look is charming. You could try dousing it in fish oil?
5114 2018-10-08 15:32:35 It's for both don't worry! My skin just frEAKS out whenever anything new comes near it.
I should have known. I tried it years ago when my skin was still oily & I broke out (just assumed cause I was adding MORE oil) now my skin is extra sensitive & dry cause of strong acne meds :/
5115 2018-10-08 15:32:23 We must keep it RED, no mater what!  The Liberals will be after that oil!  And where there’s oil or drugs, there’s Muslims!  #VoteRedToSaveUSConstitution #ccot @SenateGOP
5116 2018-10-08 15:32:15 Trump & his top-notch elites have to keep in mind how critically NK has hoaxed & cheated their previous govs & allied nations by being rewarded billions of dollars worth of oil, light water reactor, etc in her stereotyped Salami tricks, to the best collection of global memory.
5117 2018-10-08 15:32:11 Do NOT believe these bullshit polls!  Beto will prevail, trust me!

I doubt ONE Cruz supporter could point to a single, solitary benefit he has brought to Texas.

Cornyn is THE oil & gas guy, so for Rafael's ads claiming HE is makes me laugh!  Teddy spends ALL his time in Iowa.
5118 2018-10-08 15:32:08 Ja feels. Also l, what’s the deal with oil stains being a sign?
5119 2018-10-08 15:32:06 Ppl pay for oil?
5120 2018-10-08 15:32:03 I doubt it, because doing something would hurt oil and chemical companies bottom line.
5121 2018-10-08 15:32:02 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.

5129 2018-10-08 15:31:24 Yep. The house of Saud is having a difficult time...balance game - trying to remain in power, support and keep religious leaders that support them and hate the west while cont. with economic/oil ties to the west, and fight Iranian influence.
5130 2018-10-08 15:31:19 hash oil makes everything better
5131 2018-10-08 15:31:18 Can't wrap my head around what a total disaster the car has been for modern society. From.cresting the suburbs, destroying communities, massive contributions to global warming, wars for oil, propping up evil regimes that brutalize their people like Saudi Arabia. Just bad
5132 2018-10-08 15:31:18 i was thinking about you last night. like damn i really miss seeing her and she really changed my life putting me on to tea tree oil LOL

5135 2018-10-08 15:30:56 When a 10% blend knocks the price of a gallon of gasoline down by 30-40 cents, they have to be basically giving that stuff away to distributers.
5136 2018-10-08 15:30:53 Explosion at the nearby oil refinery.
5137 2018-10-08 15:30:46 Whip together 1/3 cup daily bread with 3 cups haiku roll. Blend with Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve in 3 inch slices
5138 2018-10-08 15:30:40 Nuclear is unnecessary, “clean tech” irresponsibly pushed in place of bringing the expansion of fracked oil and gas/mining to an end. IPCC seems to be politicized. Likely still underestimating greenhouse gas emissions, with CO2e being an insufficient measure.
5139 2018-10-08 15:30:33 Hi guys I so angry , I bought a Mac n cheese  take away your packer never put it in a barrier bag which caused all the oil to leak onto my new jeans , I tried washing it but the stain's still there

5155 2018-10-08 15:29:35 I don't know who is doing their forecasting, but the oil company who's project I'm working on had the Michael forecast early last week.  they were already planning to move people off of the rig.  Pretty amazing foreasting that has added to safety.

5157 2018-10-08 15:29:13 Be a climate change denier all you want. 
Remember that oil companies paid people off to deny lead in petrol caused harm for a long time.
That Governments continually lie to us all, that corporations care only about shareholder value, and shareholders are mainly investment funds.
5158 2018-10-08 15:29:13 Thanks, very much, but I tried kratom and it didn’t work.

5172 2018-10-08 15:27:59 That’s b/c the US is being run by an apocalyptic cult that is in bed with oil & coal.

5175 2018-10-08 15:27:43 One thing that frustrated me about @jaredpolis's answers in the @CBSDenver debate was how his answer to almost every problem was "free preschool and full-day kindergarten." How's that gonna help the oil worker who gets put out of work by the anti-energy left if they take over CO?
5176 2018-10-08 15:27:41 paltry ? in the days of Tony Parsons this guy would have been canned. But now he's bought and paid for by the oil industry - the spent millions at CKNW and GLOBAL and they expect results. He's a bought man.

5183 2018-10-08 15:27:11 I went home this weekend because I knew deep down that the only way I’d get an oil change is if my dad was there to make me
5184 2018-10-08 15:27:04 I believe the bubble that will bring down is the debt of Shale oil company. They do not make a profit cause of poor production second year. A reduction in oil prices will cut off financing and they will collapse. Hedge Co will collapse like 2008.
5185 2018-10-08 15:27:01 A huge fire at Irving Oil's St. John Refinery. Initial photos/videos suggest a hydrocracker caught fire and about 70-80 kbd of diesel would supply would be out.

5187 2018-10-08 15:26:50 The rich and power brokers want a return to the status quo ante. They need their oil blocks back.
5188 2018-10-08 15:26:41 CNQ will start falling this week. It's normally weak for DEMAND 1/2 way between WINTER and SUMMER which is THIS WEEK. Oct 10th the stock will react to falling oil demand, they CNQ will buy 5% of their stock while its falling. They will cancel these shares. This lowers share count
5189 2018-10-08 15:26:41 Great news. Lauren, Please also inform the public on how this congress impacted: Illinois tax payers, the deficit, the environment and POTUS changing the law to  allow US oil to be exported raising gas prices.

5192 2018-10-08 15:26:29 The human body was not designed to combat saturated fat. The butter impregnates the tissues, and then it hardens and settles like silt. Whereas olive oil- caresses your insides, leaving nothing behind but its scent 
5193 2018-10-08 15:25:52 My hair is high porosity. So when I do moisturize I do the LCO method. Leave in conditioner, cream/smoothie, and oil. Then I grease my scalp. Blue magic hair grease. Never fails me.

5200 2018-10-08 15:24:47 Hey Simon! I did 3 days as a goal, than 10 days after that, and 30 days after that. I created an ugly picture of car exhaust going into my lungs and I used peppermint oil when I felt anxiety coming on. It’s been almost a year. I also think of my kids  Crysta x
5201 2018-10-08 15:24:42 I have to use seafoam and marvel mystery oil because of that garbage ethanol, it's wrong when folks don't have a choice, just another scam like freon and many other things. I saw the legislation/regulators proposing it. Nice trade, book/bank on to next one ^5
5202 2018-10-08 15:24:36 He blinked when you asked that.

5219 2018-10-08 15:23:37 Plastic is a valuable material savings resources during its production (5% of total global crude oil consumption) and fulfils multiple functions in various applications (packaging, automotive etc.). It can and should be reused or recycled/recovered at the end of its life. (1/2)
5220 2018-10-08 15:23:37 I have a 2016 car not even 3 yrs old and everything was fine before they change my oil 
5221 2018-10-08 15:23:28 I'm starting to be an indie cologne kinda guy and my interest in skincare and bath products is uh, def growing. Beard oil is the best thing that's happened to me lately.
5222 2018-10-08 15:23:28 Pls. Find all items made from oil & petrochemicals in your house or car. Take those away & you are left with some bits of metal & a few uncoated 2x4’s. Oil is not just used in fuels. To help, Buy EV’s & support biomass based industry & renewable energy.

5224 2018-10-08 15:23:25 Shxt another reason for greedy oil companies to increase prices. We desperately need more oil refinery capacity in Alberta and Canada!

5227 2018-10-08 15:23:14 If you’re prone to break outs buy the rose hip oil. It’s light and seeps in quickly. And it’s non comedogenic.
5228 2018-10-08 15:23:13 @asda can you tell me if your stores stock peppermint oil capsules please? Thanks.
5229 2018-10-08 15:23:10 Tea tree, almond, avocado oil. My hair loves avocado oil I start using that after I did som research and my hair HATES coconut oil. I use coconut in like deep conditioners. I also put peppermint oil.. helps with dandruff/dry scalp and stimulates as well
5230 2018-10-08 15:23:06 The weakening of dollar is causing the rise of the oil prices. The rise of oil prices affects the price of commodities. Thus, the reason for inflation.
5231 2018-10-08 15:23:03 Saudi Arabia has committed to Donald Trump
that if sanctions are imposed on export of Iranian oil,
Saudia can make-up the shortfall caused by sanctions on Iranian oil exports by increasing its oil extraction

5236 2018-10-08 15:22:36 amazing how all that oil gets this country ruled by monsters a pass from US gov. - the Bush family just loved all those nasty kings and princes and frump dances with them
5237 2018-10-08 15:22:34 RT has always been pushing anti fracking news.
Reason:
1. it causes division.
2. fracking (especially in the USA) has caused oil price to plummet and badly hurt Russian economy.
Always question more what is on RT
5238 2018-10-08 15:22:34 .@Dove Please end the deforestation of critical orangutan habitats.  Stop using palm oil in your products.

5249 2018-10-08 15:21:42 There is justification 50c to 75c is almost similar with 1 to 1.15 except bakers inn people were smart...they knew where the economy was headed and maid these changes beforehand to decrease outrage...Look at the price of cooking oil right now...now that's outrageous

5255 2018-10-08 15:21:06 Indeed, I think we should follow up the win by imposing severe penalties on all the lying sacks of shit in this case.

5273 2018-10-08 15:19:55 Yes there’s high times and low times, but that can be ballasted, what’s always going to get worse however is the amount of energy it takes to get to the deeper and less pure oil sources America is trying to access for no reason other than its what we’ve been doing

5283 2018-10-08 15:18:57 That's an interesting concept!

However, to some extent I find the conclusion problematic, given willpower, a medium or "high fat" vegetable based Mediterranean diet is probably the best choice. I wouldn't want to discourage people from eating nuts and olive oil.
5284 2018-10-08 15:18:43 But less of a fool than someone saying Scottish Independence would be a disaster because the Oil won't pay for everything.

5314 2018-10-08 15:16:10 Hi Walter, we share your concerns about the environmental impact of palm oil production. Although more efforts need to be made to combat this, we're pleased that 19% of the world's palm oil is now certified & our standard is currently being revised - stay tuned for more updates.

He’s saying people go crazy for oil and then references to the Middle East drilling him. BUT there’s also a incredible joke about him being the “goat.” I’ll let you figure out the rest 
5319 2018-10-08 15:15:53 Russia and China have pipelines built for this. Russia supplies oil to Europe through pipes. Venezuela supplied oil to  US through pipes. If same is done, we will receive oil in paise/ltr at our door step. Just imagine.

5327 2018-10-08 15:15:32 Oh yeah, also decided to be healthy and take my vitamins this morning and now I can’t stop burping fish oil.
5328 2018-10-08 15:15:26 Have you tried roasted fennel?  Sliced them up (fronds and all) w/ some sliced onions, sprinkle on a pan with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake.

5330 2018-10-08 15:15:21 "The worst thing that can happen if climate change predictions are wrong?  Permanently cheaper energy for the rest of human history." That, and the UK and rest of Europe will no longer be dependant on Saudi and Russian oil. #ClimateChange #WinWin

5332 2018-10-08 15:15:12 When’s the last time you got an oil change?
5333 2018-10-08 15:15:11 Oil prices going northward, rupee going southward. US bond yield rising so FPI net inflows will reduce. Add this with expected election results and we are looking at further bloodbath.

She ducked down and grabbed the picture. It was a small oil painting of a #wide-eyed young woman that she’d seen a hundred times before on the Master’s desk. The woman’s head was tilted and her full lips parted in a wry half grin.

5339 2018-10-08 15:14:43 Neither one of you have any way of knowing what Ford said was true. There is a mountain of evidence that leads reasonable people to determine that she is not being honest. Leftists have to lie to convince people to buy their snake oil, just like Hillary and Barry.
5340 2018-10-08 15:14:36 Wish I had a man too take my car too get a oil change tom so I don’t have too wait there.
5341 2018-10-08 15:14:35 And...During these sustained flow periods, intermittent natural flow was evident, with metered rates at the separator exceeding the nominal pumped volume by up to 50 bopd, with the highest rate recorded of 191 bopd.

5343 2018-10-08 15:14:25 serum and oil to reduce oiliness. serum after toner, and the whole thing can be sealed off with an oil. if you're oily skin, you need more linoleic acide as opposed to oleic acid. tea tree oil, apricot etc work better than avocado or coconut.

5345 2018-10-08 15:14:21 Colorado politics question: I guess I’ve been out of the loop on some local stuff, what’s going on with Amendment 74? Seems like an oil & gas thing, would it also be a major municipal zoning & planning thing?

5348 2018-10-08 15:14:03 Modi is not speaking about high oil and gas prices on account of taxes.Surely he is not going to win more seats by increaing these taxes.

5354 2018-10-08 15:13:52 Basically it’s about consistency. From thinnest liquid to thickest. 
I use micellar water, a face wash, an essence, a toner, a serum, an eye cream, a facial oil, moisturiser then sunscreen. 
Try a Korean beauty brand. Try a vitamin C serum from Klairs or the Cosrx ampoule.
5355 2018-10-08 15:13:49 Yeah... Didn't Obama name an Oil Tanker after her?
5356 2018-10-08 15:13:32 I would just like everyone to know that I am drinking a cold brew while waiting for my oil change and I’m wearing Calvin Klein sweatpants, vans, and a hoodie. I am the epitome of cute, fall, and gay. Also I just feel great.
5357 2018-10-08 15:13:30 Republicans are choosing dirty oil over clean power. It’s a death sentence for the next generation.
5358 2018-10-08 15:13:29 A few markets drift higher in today's meager "risk-off" environment. Crude oil is well-off its lows, as are stocks, as the dollar comes off its highs. corn dn 2, beans up 3, wheat dn 5, KC dn 4, MN dn 1 #oatt

I just checked the RNS for 10th of September and look what I found.. Gas rates at the test separator and through the enclosed flare remained broadly constant at around 15,000 cubic feet per day.
That would be my final answer...
5362 2018-10-08 15:12:45 Yup. I feel like the effects of CBD oil are way more. . . even-handed, too.
5363 2018-10-08 15:12:43 I found that there's alot of subjectivity so the adage "the squeeky wheel gets the oil" often times applies.
5364 2018-10-08 15:12:39 Because people are not thinking. Really though because most of government revenues come from crude oil sales.
5365 2018-10-08 15:12:38 Reading the posts telling parents to buy illicit oil for their sick children makes me want to scream.

Clearly you have no children or you'd  feel the risk they do.

5372 2018-10-08 15:12:06 Me too but no jiffy lube or anything around here carries the oil i use for my car so i have to pay for the oil myself and then get no discount for the oil change.
5373 2018-10-08 15:12:05 Hopefully no one is injured in the oil refinery fire.
And hopefully they don't raise the price of oil for us, the consumers over it.

5382 2018-10-08 15:11:34 @emzanotti supplements are today’s version of snake oil, swamp real estate in Florida and time shares in flood zones.
5383 2018-10-08 15:11:33 there was an oil explosion today and people are still going to think that we should keep investing more and more in the oil industry and ignore the lives it's taking
5384 2018-10-08 15:11:26 Still use mineral oil on the Shou sugi ban finish? I bet these boards smell amazing!
5385 2018-10-08 15:11:24 I hope so too. And I hope we have a way of spiriting her to safer spaces when/if that happens
5386 2018-10-08 15:11:22 #AMER bargain with oil at these levels - p.a net cash flow and cash plus high oil plus pipeline = a mkt cap many multiples of current price - expect this to move up soon
5387 2018-10-08 15:11:18 @PMOIndia @arunjaitley @abpnewshindi Respected sir you reduce the price of petrol/Diesel by 1.50 & by oil company Rs.1 yourself loss of 10500 cr but another side you loose Rs. 1lac cr due to crash of share market. Your decision of cut price Rs.1 by oil company it was big mistake
5388 2018-10-08 15:11:12 Thanks David - it’s actually a huge investment opportunity, inclusive of all countries not just the few ‘lucky’ enough to be sitting on coal seams/oil beds.

5416 2018-10-08 15:09:22 Put a serum on. The more hydrated your skin the less oil the face produces.
5417 2018-10-08 15:09:21 And the smell of vitamin e oil! 
5418 2018-10-08 15:09:21 How much is oil now. Over $80 per barrel. Have you felt yesterday impact? Has it improved your economy. Just two weeks ago, it was said by the CBN gov that we might slip back into recession. How is that improvement?

5432 2018-10-08 15:08:15 I actually prefer CBD oil over marijuana because it doesn't get you high (or make you hungry afterwards).

It just relaxes you, helps you sleep, and keeps your cortisol low.

5438 2018-10-08 15:07:46 Oil Refinery fires are not easy, especially what you are dealing with in terms of potential explosion. 

FYI
Irving Oil Fire Service would have been first on site follow by STJ Fire. 

You can expect that foam trucks from the airport as well as STJ Fire would be used
5439 2018-10-08 15:07:44 You can also try the Niacinamide from The Ordinary. It also helps lessen sebum production. I know it sounds scary and tedious, but I SWEAR BY IT. I don't blot the oil off my face as much since I started using it :)
5440 2018-10-08 15:07:40 It's probably already too late but you might want to gas up your car ASAP. Hurricane Michael's presence in the Gulf should be enough to bump up oil prices due to some interruption on the Gulf oil rigs over the next 48 hours.
5441 2018-10-08 15:07:36 With Canada's largest oil refinery burning, it's going to be an expensive, cold winter for gas, home heating fuel, diesel, aircraft fuel,food. #SaintJohn #IrvingOil #nlpoli #StaySafe
5442 2018-10-08 15:07:31 Change my own oil or pay someone to do it 
5443 2018-10-08 15:07:28 Whoa, did they plant explosives in the oil coming from the Middle East?  That would NEVER happen, if we could get Alberta oil there via a pipeline.
5444 2018-10-08 15:07:02 I have asked this question before:  How do you propose to get a Boeing 747, or any aircraft off the ground with wind, solar, battery, or other renewable energy.  Oil is here to stay.
5445 2018-10-08 15:07:00 Well if they don't have the foreign currency to to import crude oil and packaging material then they don't have "more than enough capacity to meet the national demand for cooking oil," as they put it.

5448 2018-10-08 15:06:39 You HAVE to moisturize to lessen the oil. I didn't bother before too, but it has worked wonders! I've yet to try it - it's the Clinique Anti-blemish solutions, it's recommended to use at night so it may be a bit heavy for the morning.
5449 2018-10-08 15:06:30 Strong message on rupee-dollar, cash - black Money, rising imports, petrol/oil prices, current account deficit, LIC-ILFS, balooning NPA's, Rafale, fleeing cronies/Mallya, ONGC-GPSC, DRI scam, electoral bonds?

5450 2018-10-08 15:06:30 FYI To visitors of Portland

5463 2018-10-08 15:05:17 Had that debate (argument) in person with 'gentlemen of influence' from two of the countries involved when discussing bio oil refineries. There was less than zero enthusiasm from them.

5480 2018-10-08 15:03:05 it will only get worse with the Oil Prices on the UP -:)

5483 2018-10-08 15:02:55 I didn't know she was responsible for the boom in shale oil production in the US. The US is a net exporter so they don't need our oil. If only some other party that had been in power for 40 years had done something to get pipelines built to the coast.

5493 2018-10-08 15:02:18 The largest refinery in Canada is burning as we speak. How are they going to supply the dirty Saudi oil now?

5505 2018-10-08 15:01:23 Ya you better check again it will slowly melt fuel lines. Give it time. Also when oil is cheep why would we farm corn to make this? We don’t need it and never did. Tell us how many acres needed for a gallon?

5510 2018-10-08 15:01:03 Indeed -- especially rich considering that Oregon-based PAC/West is making millions to run oil & gas ballot & PR campaigns here

5512 2018-10-08 15:00:59 Lol. That's all one recipe for gumbo. First brown some flour in oil to make the roux, then toss in chicken & andouille sausage to blacken, then add the holy trinity + pope (onion, bell pepper, celery + garlic), then water and spices and simmer forever.

5517 2018-10-08 15:00:34 Thanks Peter. I always find it difficult to persuade friends or family not to burn coal/turf/wood or using home heating oil -- they see no real alternative or see solar/PV panels as prohibitively expensive and complicated, even with grants.

5529 2018-10-08 14:59:51 Sad to realise that my "educated" Twitter friends don't know the meaning of crude. A whole TL of folks making themselves stupid dismissing Pure drop's statement about importing crude oil. Guys, let us research on what we don't know before running our mouths.
5530 2018-10-08 14:59:48 Only plans, and India has no technology to extract oil&gas in the Arctic region.
5531 2018-10-08 14:59:42 Twitter or Book???
5532 2018-10-08 14:59:41 You travel with them oil form or the actual herb?
5533 2018-10-08 14:59:39 It’s days like today when I’m so glad my hometown radio station has a streaming app. 
(You wouldn’t think it’s possible to find some peace of mind waiting for an oil change but here we are.)
5534 2018-10-08 14:59:37 About 1/4 of the my daily caloric intake could be attributed to olive oil
5535 2018-10-08 14:59:36 As the habitat collapses and oil companies falter, they will literally say anything to try to maintain one last day of profits.  Question heterosexism and the cult of natalism.
5536 2018-10-08 14:59:16 Oh baby oil is good for eczema too
5537 2018-10-08 14:59:13 I just picked them up yesterday shopping usually I like to take it and slice it brush it with olive oil sea salt pepper and put it on the grill add a little ricotta on top with a spoonful of marinara
5538 2018-10-08 14:59:07 I had depression and anxiety, and they would work hand in hand.

So, CBD oil really got my anxiety down, to relax my brain and muscles and help me sleep. But, intermittent fasting really hit the ball out the park.
5539 2018-10-08 14:59:04 อ่ะๆๆๆๆๆๆ ถูกค่ะ อิอิ
5540 2018-10-08 14:58:54 Your tweet caught my attention as I've not heard that data argued before.  Certainly gives us another platform.   I have always likened the extraction of oil to sucking the blood out of a human being... But that was my own Theory...

5550 2018-10-08 14:57:59 I agree, but worry we shouldn't underestimate capitalism's ability to evolve their strategy. The day that the value of untapped oil reserves is exceeded by the value of a cap-and-trade style green energy market, they will do a 180. And people will applaud them for it.

5552 2018-10-08 14:57:53 Huh. "preventing oil shale development" Eh? 

And I thought it was the decades and decades and decades of failed attempts to turn "oil shale" into a marketable product that did that. 

I'm not sure "Free Enterprise" means what you think it does.

5561 2018-10-08 14:57:00 This is similar to a waffle recipie I've used, so I think it would work there too.  I think they mean to keep the bowl for the egg whites free of oil, not water to make the stiff egg whites.  Nothing screws up stiff beaten egg whites like a drip of yolk or a smudge of oil...

5567 2018-10-08 14:56:15 It's a good video.  It'd probably have more impact on some moderates if you knew basic grammar.  Plus gas prices are a product of the Obama administration's foreign policy.  US now produces more oil than anyone in the world.  So prices will begin to fall.  Just in time for 2020

5602 2018-10-08 14:53:26 Yes but the deserts a long time ago when the planet was warmer weren't deserts. They were forests. How do you think Saudi Arabia has so much oil?

5605 2018-10-08 14:53:19 No, the oil barons and their Republican supporters are committing genocide.

5660 2018-10-08 14:49:15 We know the west wants to destroy Russia's protection over the Middle East so the West can degrade and destroy them. Afterwards the pipelines go in and the oil and natural gas is stolen by the people. Perhaps the financial robbers intend to send all Syria to the U.S afterwards?

5694 2018-10-08 14:46:29 Hope everyone is okay over in Saint John. Heard about the apparent refinery explosion at Irving Oil.
5695 2018-10-08 14:46:21 You understand what a volatile commodity is? A fine idea to fund our burdensome welfare state in such a way. Give me a pragmatic economic forecast that says indy is of net benefit to the Scottish economy (without oil). I’ll wait...
5696 2018-10-08 14:46:16 We need drastic action to fight climate change, but thankfully the Canadian government is... *checks sheet* running its own oil company.

5875 2018-10-08 14:32:45 Yes, I do. You see, GDP growth immediately contracted from 6.23% Q3 to 5.94% in Q4 2014.

This was mainly due to a contraction in oil GDP from 1.06% growth in Q3 to -8.28% negative in Q4
Non-oil GDP stayed positive at 3.46%. See image

5887 2018-10-08 14:31:55 頭痛
5888 2018-10-08 14:31:42 What kind of oil are we talking? Palm oil, peanut oil, extra virgin olive oil?
5889 2018-10-08 14:31:35 Can anyone recommend a good beginner/intermediate guide to Facebook/social advertising that is up-to-date, and backed up by data, stats and evidence about what actually works, rather than just put together by some snake oil salesman who writes bs and hopes no one knows better?
5890 2018-10-08 14:31:32 You are absolutely correct the police have no concern whatsoever for the violent communist Thugs in the street
5891 2018-10-08 14:31:30 @SixtDE horrifying experience. Car Rental from Frankfurt on saturday, broke down on autobahn. When opened the bonnet, there was oil all over the engine, the lid of the oil refilling unit was not put up by the service man. Luckily Missed fatal accident. Playing with human lives!!

Stay safe in those oil fields!
5895 2018-10-08 14:31:20 And how do we fund the innovation you propose? Should we take some of the subsidies our federal and provincial governments give to the oil and gas industry?
5896 2018-10-08 14:31:17 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
5897 2018-10-08 14:31:16 The best method I found, I use a five quart pressure cooker with the gauge and button removed, the edges of the lid are sealed and the steam vents nicely out the holes, minimal oil splatter, sunflower seed oil
5898 2018-10-08 14:31:16 So still no specificd, but let's see if I follow. Great uncertainty exists, mainly due to failed NEB processes, but also perhaps due to NAFTA negotiations. WCS price for oil has ranked mostly due to lack of pipeline capacity, so risk is increased and return lowered. /1

5928 2018-10-08 14:29:09 They were not the first, public info vids show most govs knew about it from the 50's they just didn't know the extent. Oil companies had worked out the basics of extent and ramifications by the 70's, they hid their findings for another 20 years, then slowed our progress after.

5982 2018-10-08 14:24:36 yes.
I am so ashamed of this guy. 
He's a snake oil salesman.
5983 2018-10-08 14:24:34 First the sand is saturated with oil.  Second oil sands producers are not the government which has the ability to use force (ie the courts and police) to compel you to do things. Should foreign money be influencing Canadian government??

5988 2018-10-08 14:24:21 Saudi Arabia has one thing. Oil.

US energy + solar + wind = Saudi Arabia becomes irrelevant.

Fun fact: Obama sold neutron bombs (micro nukes) to Saudi Arabia. And SA used them against Yemeni rebels. Hiroshima, Nagasaki plus FIVE(?) more nukes strike in world history.

5991 2018-10-08 14:24:11 Gahd! The oil price hike is not the fault of our President. Every nation faces the same problem. If you attended your economic subject, basic rule- High Demand, Low Supply = Higher Prices. 
5992 2018-10-08 14:24:06 You realise an independent Scotland hold a few of the cards. It's one of the only eu oil & gas producing Nations. It controls most of the North sea fishing fields. Plus it has over 40% of the EU wind power potential.

5998 2018-10-08 14:23:46 Thanks. I appreciate your action. The issue is resolved partially as a person from Indian oil has escalated the agency twice. "And also informed me not to give any money to delivery person, if the delay gas delivery in future because if this complaint you can inform us".
5999 2018-10-08 14:23:37 I do worry so about what is happening around the world. Oil seems to be the fuel. All of this business with China is awful. China is dug into California like a tick not to mention our electronics.

6005 2018-10-08 14:23:16 They want to import crude oil because we are not farming soya beans, cotton, sunflower etc to allow ourselves to have sufficient crude oil. This despite having the best weather and soils for those crops. Security of tenure and rule of law needed in commercial agriculture.

6007 2018-10-08 14:23:01 Vicente Falanga upgraded Petrobras to OP and raised his TP to R$40/sh (US$20/ADR), mostly on lower risks and better oil price conditions. In light of Brazil’s presidential run-off, he sees greater odds of a partial fiscal adjustment, and positive risk/reward asymmetry for PBR.
6008 2018-10-08 14:22:59 The tax is a ripoff to Canadians get revenue from oil sales stop keeping it a reserve for the usa.
6009 2018-10-08 14:22:56 @realDonaldTrump Trump will be blamed if oil costs go higher than 70 $. The profit earned by Saudi Arabia is going to help China and Pakistan! Beware! Give relaxation to India for oil in Iran which will keep oil price at check!India is the big country to check china,Pakistan

6031 2018-10-08 14:20:56 Yay for a whole day of geeking out and thinking like an oil and gas engineer - and then getting nice feedback for the press release from the boss 
6032 2018-10-08 14:20:54 Its pretty gnarly that a huge explosion happened at an oil refinery and Irving is like "chill guys. We'll let you know whats up." Am i gonna die in a fireball or what?
6033 2018-10-08 14:20:54 We're following some more breaking news, out of St. John New Brunswick this morning. Reports of an explosion at an oil refinery in town. So far, no word on any injuries or the extent of the damages. Several photos showing fire and thick clouds of black smoke. @680NEWS

6035 2018-10-08 14:20:45 We are going to go on needing coal and oil for a long time - but in fact they are too valuable a resource to go in burning them.  We should use these fossil resources for other things not as fuel.

6057 2018-10-08 14:19:37 They can’t do anything right now. We need Saudi’s to pump the oil because Iran is being sanctioned. Unless we want $4/$5 gas @ pumps. Not saying it is not right to stand up. Give them a warning and follow with retribution when things settle down/oil markets. You know this...

6065 2018-10-08 14:18:59 They’ll get the waiver. Only need to show “significant reduction" in oil imports from Iran. That much has already happened.
6066 2018-10-08 14:18:57 Companies like Exxon mobile won't stop until we point our guns of criticism at them.  The key companies that affect the global picture should not be allowed to escape the discussion. The Coal and Oil consumption needs to be controled. #California

6105 2018-10-08 14:16:02 Fracking is used mainly to extract natural gas.
Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, producing half the carbon dioxide as coal and about a third less than oil. It also emits fewer amounts of toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.

6160 2018-10-08 14:11:17 Hi Matthew. You can indeed use Door Oil on top of Wood Protector. If the door is solid we recommend two coats on top but if it's veneered then only use one coat.

Do you also wonder why Hillary took money from big banks, oil and mining companies? Pharmaceutical companies? Give your head a shake, sport. The Dems still bow to corporate interests, just different interests than the GOP.

6166 2018-10-08 14:10:43 With KXL on the table the other pipelines make no sense. The highest price in the world for our bitumen is in the US Gulf coast. TMX and EE are the least effectient way to get oil there. And climate change says we need to rapidly reduce oil consumption NOW.

6183 2018-10-08 14:09:10 Ah Tich. Remember SW is a global player dealing in crude oil. In Zimbabwe they bought shareholding in the now Surface Wilmar and in Olivine Limited as well. I believe they want to push their global business and have no interest in growing Soya in Zim.
6184 2018-10-08 14:09:04 Irrigate African deserts with  desalination plants & power plants. Carbon is stored best in vegatation. Stop fighting the fossil fuel battle, it's a nonwinnable fight. You could use fossil fuel generators to do it, so big oil can PROFIT, & it's a done deal.
6185 2018-10-08 14:08:52 Low-key want to ask my parents if they can go to Walmart for me and get my oil change... I don't want to go anywhere anymore.
6186 2018-10-08 14:08:03 Shrinking supplies from Iran, along with strong global growth, has fired up bullish sentiment in the oil market. Uncertainty over how much politically troubled OPEC countries can pump to make up for production shortfalls could propel prices to $100.

6217 2018-10-08 14:05:18 #isTMXbestchoice After reading the Canada Energy Board report is seems to be clear that we need better/more refineries in Canada. Why do we have to buy 100% refining oil in Ontario from the USA and in the Eastern Provinces from  Saudi Arabia. see: 2018cndnrfnrvrvw-eng.pdf

6219 2018-10-08 14:05:11 I'd hate to burst your bubble but you have it all wrong and it is this kind of thinking that is about to lead us into another 'recession'.

6242 2018-10-08 14:03:13 that's the whole "anthropocene" debate, really - but in terms of dramatically impacting the scale/rate of the carbon cycle, I think the widespread exploitation of ancient buried carbon (coal, then oil) in the mid 19th C is the point. thats where we started changing earth systems.

6294 2018-10-08 13:58:20 Franky  we should  not be importing edible oil at all..half of  Cane farmers should  shift to  oilseeds ..there is excess sugar production in India... But the liquor  industry controlled  by politicans from behind  will not allow  unfortunately!
6295 2018-10-08 13:58:13 India n US heading towards collision course on arbitrary sanctions; India will buy 9 mn barrels of Iranian oil in Nov, indicating world's third-biggest oil importer will continue purchasing crude from Iran despite US sanctions coming into force on Nov. ...Bold step.

6300 2018-10-08 13:58:00 I think both Dakotas&Wyoming  should become one state. I think Mississippi should secede. Texas should stop getting oil subsidies& pay for their own indigent care. May never happen, but one can dream

6305 2018-10-08 13:57:28 Don't forget tidal power, too - abandoned by this government. The problem is, renewable energy providers don't have the lobbying power (i.e. deep pockets) of the oil and gas companies.

6320 2018-10-08 13:56:25 It’s Thanksgiving Day in Canada. For one day, let’s put aside all forms of partisanship & consider the staggering wealth we have in this country. Not natural resources...but the human kind. Each of us are of greater value than oil, gold, or commodities.

6322 2018-10-08 13:56:11 No more mass construction of civs, we're all about that oil refinery 
6323 2018-10-08 13:56:09 Conventional energy sources based on oil, coal and natural gas are commonly used for industrial needs,but at the same time damaging the environment because of its limitations. Researches over the years have shown that carbon emission amounts are reducing slowly, thanks #ENTR #ICO
6324 2018-10-08 13:56:01 At the risk of announcing my ignorance, is there a different crude oil than the one we extract fuel from?
6325 2018-10-08 13:56:00 #isTMXbestchoice Canada is the 7th largest crude oil producer in the world. Despite this, Canadian refineries process less than 30% of that crude oil. This is mainly because of the size of Canada’s refining industry compared to the resource size and the location of its refineries
6326 2018-10-08 13:55:57 Just where is this conquered oil field you speak of?
6327 2018-10-08 13:55:55 This is the key draw for me in overseas super/hypermarkets. Especially really local crisps. I remember in Spain during a ripping hangover a friend and I saw off a 350g bag of local Spanish crisps whose ingredients were: potatoes, olive oil, salt.
6328 2018-10-08 13:55:51 This is the economy we live in those who stockpile & i mean customers  eg fuel ,cooking oil and such are thinking of the killing to be made in as soon as the shortage becomes endemic and as for our cash exchangers their will be a bumper harvest for them especially with the new 2%

6331 2018-10-08 13:55:43 What does an oil change have to do with the brakes..
6332 2018-10-08 13:55:36 Took my car in for an oil change and the employee told me he doesn't change his own oil anymore either and OK THEN WHO CHANGES HIS OIL ??? Is this like the barber paradox or ???

6334 2018-10-08 13:55:23 I think I need an intervention. I've reached a point where the "you're going to die" argument doesn't work on me anymore.

-You should bake your fries instead of frying them
-Not going to happen. I like them better when they're cooked with oil
-But you're going to die
-So are you
6335 2018-10-08 13:55:18 NG APC they love oil and gas money. They do not have your interest at heart. They struggle for the share of oil wealth and the landlords are settled and kept in perpetual poverty-stricken conditions. Too bad. Take back what belongs to you. The more delay the poverty and killing
6336 2018-10-08 13:55:13 ooh what kind of essential oil did you use?

Why are we constantly running out of bombs?

Why are we spending more to kill brown people and steal oil and pipeline territory than during the height of the Iraq war?
6347 2018-10-08 13:54:24 It's not banning whole sectors of the economy. Simply setting oil and gas back away from businesses and schools only a HALF MILE.

6371 2018-10-08 13:52:35 Saudi = $ and lots of it. They'll have lots of expatriates who live there that'll watch it. It's oil rich, so plenty of Westerners are there.

6389 2018-10-08 13:50:57 'Crude Oil'

Crude oil is a naturally occurring, unrefined petroleum product composed of hydrocarbon deposits and other organic materials. A type of fossil fuel, crude oil can be refined to produce usable products such as gasoline, diesel and various forms of petrochemicals.

6404 2018-10-08 13:49:00 The truth of the matter is, if the UK went dead tomorrow the planet would only be 2% better off. If China and USA stop using oil and gas tomorrow, civilization will collapse.

6418 2018-10-08 13:47:26 that's true for a handful of conservative career politicians, but the run-of-the-mill rich asshole that just funnels his wealth into PACs definitely thinks that climate change is actually a liberal hoax and that oil is only ever a growth industry
6419 2018-10-08 13:47:25 Överlåt detta till ingenjörerna. Peak oil visade sig vara precis så mycket lögn som ingenjörerna hela tiden påstod. Märkligt att de som kan räkna alltid har rätt och de som, där du hör till, inte kan räkna alltid har fel.
6420 2018-10-08 13:47:06 Mercedes got me fucked up... $750 for a full service. $150 for just the oil change.
6421 2018-10-08 13:47:03 “America has reclaimed its throne atop the oil world. For the first time since 1973, the U.S. is the world’s largest producer of crude oil.”

6440 2018-10-08 13:44:55 Well a bunch of international business like oil, are backed by USD and not by gold. Plus national currencies (FIAT) at the end of the day they've always been backed by people's faith in it.

6577 2018-10-08 13:27:10 We could be in the timeline in which John Hannah is on that plane and romances you with his Monty Python quotes and you start a new life together, setting up an alternative lifestyle website selling snake oil to fucking idiots.
6578 2018-10-08 13:27:08 Lookin at the list of top carbon emissions per capita (inc. Qatar, Curacao, Kuwait & Bahrain) surely a massive drive away from oil is the solution - plus an invigorated electorate willing to take politicians & parties to task over their green credentials #IPCCReport

6580 2018-10-08 13:27:06 Grim, as in, you're surrounded by oil refinery/silols/tankers stuff and plenty of fences to keep you out. It has that that post-apocalyptic feel about it. Plus, I normally do the  early am sailing so it's middle of the night and normally winter!

6582 2018-10-08 13:26:58 I'm just always taken aback each time I think about how we are even permitted to spew all this non-renewable energy into thin air, never to be seen again.... well, other than the drastic effect on #climatechange it must be posing.

Take the #naturalgas or leave the #oil. Simple.
6583 2018-10-08 13:26:57 Lol so California is a wealthy state? They are always on the verge of bankruptcy. Most of the states with low tax rates in the west have oil revenue that subsidizes low tax rates. NM is the largest reciever of govt money in the country. You should do some research some time.
6584 2018-10-08 13:26:55 If Iranian oil is cheap, no amount of threat will work with India, except of course the US is willing to bargain with India on some other deal.

6616 2018-10-08 13:23:42 India has done its part, now it is for US to act and give India waiver in S 400 defence deal and oil purchase from Iran. It will give clear signal to China where it stands in Trump administration's world view.

6719 2018-10-08 13:14:41 How is oil said differently?
6720 2018-10-08 13:14:40 Zimbabwe has been reduced to a cooking oil economy.
6721 2018-10-08 13:14:36 Where govt effort should be going -- getting the oil refineries going  . .  Arent the major ones locally owned . . Blue Ribbon, TA?  Bonkers.. at least get aid to set up small scale refineries in growth points

The US stepping up and taking a bigger role in the oil markets keeps the world from being held hostage by others.
6730 2018-10-08 13:13:33 Dear @cathmckenna, Thank you for your commitment towards meeting or beating our #ParisAgreement targets. Please reconsider your pursuit of oil sand expansion, pipelines and LNG, because they're not compatible with a safer and cleaner future for our kids and grandchildren. #SR15

6733 2018-10-08 13:13:10 Mi5 & Mi6 have exclusively served the status quo rather than give a damn about the people & have been virulently hostile to foreigners, especially those cursed through sitting on massive reserves of oil.
Mi5 & Mi6 should be terminated while we start again from scratch.

6742 2018-10-08 13:12:10 Nutox cleansing oil okey tak? I mean ada buat jadi tiny bumps tak?
6743 2018-10-08 13:12:06 Lots of vested interests. Many of those 'commentators' on platforms such as Breitbart are funded by Big Oil to rubbish green technology that will threaten their own profits, getting to the point where it is almost impossible to make an objective view.
6744 2018-10-08 13:12:05 You know that knowledge of climate change has been in the public domain since the 70s, right? But, it was suppressed and shouted over by the big oil companies, who are more interested in turning a profit than saving the world.

6746 2018-10-08 13:11:59 I really like @TheBodyShopUK Camomile butter. You rub it all in, then rinse off with a flannel. Or coconut oil is a good substitute, but leaves my skin a little greasy, so I try to stick to their butter as I’ve mentioned. They also do an eye make up remover in that range.
6747 2018-10-08 13:11:58 @cnpprofessional hi there can you tell me about your use of palm oil (which contributes to the destruction of rainforests) in your products please?

6751 2018-10-08 13:11:41 It'd  be the least profitable, most elaborate hoax in history. There's just nothing in it for scientists. There are plenty of other topics they can research and still make a living, which by the way is nothing compared to the billions the oil industry has invested against this.

6753 2018-10-08 13:11:37 2/ Rus lives off of oil exports & is ethnically defined while demographically shrinking. Happens to align interests with many US conservatives. Both are losing battles in long term. Sustainability & urban life demand adaptation...

6758 2018-10-08 13:11:10 I dare to imagine a world where the only use of coal is in throwing it through the windshield of an oil exec's limo. 

Well, that and water filter cartridges.
6759 2018-10-08 13:11:05 I am probably the most confused person today. Instead of putting salt into the egg mixture, I put it into the pan. And instead of putting oil into the pan I put it I into the eggs mixture. wtf yani

6780 2018-10-08 13:09:06 *killing humans* Oh... this coming from my eye? No, I'm... I'm not crying. That's... it's an oil leak. Just oil. J-just oil....
6781 2018-10-08 13:09:05 My friend raves about CBD oil pain reliever spray. He gave me a bottle but I haven't needed to use it yet. His mom has awful plantar fasciitis and it's the only thing that's worked for her.

6785 2018-10-08 13:08:41 Yeah because there’s no money in oil right? It’s only in clean energy...
6786 2018-10-08 13:08:30 Everyday at work there always seems to be a new project for me. Today it was vehicle repair. Changed tires, oil and now working out changing the break pads. I’m this companies Swiss Army knife.
6787 2018-10-08 13:08:26 Wow! We'll probably put the heating back on some time this week. Right now we just use a small oil heater in the mornings/evenings for downstairs and one radiator in the bedroom.
6788 2018-10-08 13:08:20 I think tar and feather is more appropriate than ass whooping. But I'm a traditionalist.

6806 2018-10-08 13:06:22 I repeat, Turkey was buying oil directly, just teaching private importers (TIRs), but also own TIRs to transport.
6807 2018-10-08 13:06:16 No job, economy trailing, oil prices raised, Rupee lost value, market crashing, essentials are sold high, rape atrocities on the raise, many more to document.Who promised India Achche Din before 2014 general election?.

6812 2018-10-08 13:05:49 This doesn't show anything more than a steady 2/3% growth in non-oil revenue. Compare that to the volatility of the oil revenue and tell me why the PDP government's during that period weren't more aggressive in their attempt to diversify the economy.
6813 2018-10-08 13:05:44 こわョ
6814 2018-10-08 13:05:42 Free flowing oil. No pump.
6815 2018-10-08 13:05:36 There won't be one. The Saudis have waged a propaganda war on every other major oil producing nation to carve out a monopoly for themselves. Western governments are too chickenshit to speak out lest the Al-Sauds turn off the flow of oil and petrodollars.

6819 2018-10-08 13:04:59 I’m so sorry, Mother Nature, but the US. has decided they would rather spew non-renewable coal and oil garbage into the environment for cash than save the planet.

The GOP doesn’t “believe” in science. Republicans are wildly greedy and not smart.

Our children will curse us.

NATGAS 1H pausing here, momentum levels off. Just WATCH

6832 2018-10-08 13:03:36 At this juncture when high global oil prices are wreaking havoc on oil import-dependant  emerging economies the US has no business to prevent supply of Iran oil to the world. This could exacerbate global inequalities & unemployment. US needs to look beyond it's nose.
6833 2018-10-08 13:03:16 But, but, the playboy Prince just bragged to Trump about compensating the oil output cuz Iranian sanctions...He’s being proactive.
6834 2018-10-08 13:03:11 Ha, their headlines are always clickbait. Just stay away from commercial brands and look for chemical-free, fragrance-free sunscreen at a health food store instead, like Badger which has only five or six pronouncable non-toxic ingredients - zinc oxide, beeswax, Vit E oil...
6835 2018-10-08 13:03:11 The oil that they use to fry the donuts combined with the type of batter they use makes them disgusting to me
It's the same reason I cant eat 95% of fair food
6836 2018-10-08 13:03:07 Ini kayaknya krn kotor aja mukanya, ya? Kalo mukamu normal, coba double cleansing (micellar water - facewash)

6848 2018-10-08 13:01:51 George is a colonial fud , a labour fud of the worst degree , hated by his ain , and a socialist in name only. As for Iraq , Iran , Palestine , Libya he was on the money - strange he canny see the oil war on his auld hame in the same light.
6849 2018-10-08 13:01:44 I agree. The only option today is gasoline and the only source of from oil. A choice to use biofuels is a great one and should be available nationwide and year-round.

6862 2018-10-08 13:00:27 Venezuela isn’t exactly thriving despite having the largest proven reserves in the World. If there‘s an economic argument to be made for indy then oil should play no part. If oil forecasts are displayed then it should be as low/med/high and even then shown to be only a bonus.

6876 2018-10-08 12:59:29 Check the contraindications if you are on other drugs, as I believe you need to take them around 4 hours between CBD oil and certain types of drugs as CBD oil can reduce their effect. Worthwhile researching if you are on any.

6880 2018-10-08 12:59:25 No, oil  was bought by the Turkish state firm. It supplied weapons and  ammunition to it. ISIS had permanent support in Turkey, MIT service,  ISIS fighters went to Turkey for healing and holidays.

6886 2018-10-08 12:58:47 TIC data are old data. I am using September data, which showed a worldwide stampede out of US bonds as Asian Central banks have to pay for oil and cannot hoard US assets. This only  gets much worse until year end.
6887 2018-10-08 12:58:44 Choose a oil that works for you: 
• Castor oil 
• Olive oil 
• Vitamin E oil 
• Coconut oil 
• Almond oil etc
6888 2018-10-08 12:58:36 No, silly, the Agnus Dei is dissolved in oil, which is soaked up by the host. Don’t you know your faith?
6889 2018-10-08 12:58:36 I too believe in oil medium term, but still you cant say now - is it some risk off ( actually with SP 500 near 2900, difficult to define it like real sell of :) ) or market participants already found pain threshold for now
6890 2018-10-08 12:58:32 Think they mixed up monthly payment vs deductible.
6891 2018-10-08 12:58:26 It then shows we have criminals masquerading as businessmen. Cooking oil is not being imported and there is absolutely no reason why it should be sold above the recommended price when they are buying it at the usual wholesale price.

6979 2018-10-08 12:49:40 I believe it is being driven by the greed of the Oil companies, and as long as they make vast sums that can be used to lobby and bribe, there will only ever be token gestures. There will be a point when Oil will not be profitable - It's down to the consumers..

6992 2018-10-08 12:47:39 There was supposed to be a refinery built in NB so Canada can refine its own oil...that went out the window
6993 2018-10-08 12:47:29 There was only so much I could write about. The brief connection I made was more broadly to his " cozy relationship with oil producers" (with links to earlier stories) backed up with a quote from @RL_Miller

Educate yourself on Saudi exports and companies. Write in a search bar top Saudi companies, check their financials then cry
7015 2018-10-08 12:46:02 It is. But could it be the time is not right for an increment? Im just asking- I don’t have any empirical study or anything. Just that for my industry, oil/ gas that is, a lot of contractors are suffering due to lack of businesses, slashing prices to stay alive

7018 2018-10-08 12:45:22 I think thats the next step they have to take. Cause these retailers would hve bought the cooking oil at wholesale price, which i believe will be less thn $3.70, saka varikubira maconsumers.

7026 2018-10-08 12:44:37 My baby had cradle cap on his hairline. I used coconut oil and it came right out 
7027 2018-10-08 12:44:36 By opening up trans mountain for instance you get a lot of transport tankers off the highways and less oil delivered by rail (which is much more Risky than a pipeline).  It's funny how BC allowed LMC to build a pipeline but our Alberta oil, not so much

7032 2018-10-08 12:44:15 All of this is fake news. Just keep pumping oil and consuming single-use plastics, both at ever-increasing rates. Because haha, liberal tears...
7033 2018-10-08 12:43:33 Clean tech oil, right up there with clean coal technology. Our economy runs on oil, but let's not insult people's intelligence by calling oil clean.
7034 2018-10-08 12:43:22 Are you aware that Mr @Busisa74 is the CEO for URL the manufacturers of ROIL cooking oil? They are selling the cooking oil at the usual price and this what we are saying that these chaos are being caused by economic saboteurs.
7035 2018-10-08 12:43:14 Yes! I have used topical stuff for pain, but oil for anxiety. I got Charlotte’s Web at the Durm Co-op but they also have some products at Central Compounding  I hear.

7072 2018-10-08 12:39:35 I am not sure that this is an extension to the oil pad site. I cannot find any planning permission.  The scoping report for the extension does not include this area but rather land on the other side of pad and still part of the original field. However it is on top of pipeline!
7073 2018-10-08 12:39:25 Congrats to those of you who have been watching $PBR dark pool prints being reporteds the past 2 weeks. As we now know, Brazil is sizzling. And in this case, this Brazil oil stock broke key resistance for very nice spike/gain.

7083 2018-10-08 12:38:32 Don't hold your breath on that one, the Saudis have effectively waged a propaganda war on the other oil producing nations of the world so there is zero chance of a robust response from supine western leaders.

7088 2018-10-08 12:37:22 Mr . Trump  , If we are producing so much oil now . Why are oil prices so high ? We are being charged $ 1.89 too much a gal . Other countries that supply oil in their country , sell their oil for pennies a gal .  Get rid of the oil millionaire in your office . go after oil co's
7089 2018-10-08 12:37:05 at $3.75 (Zollars) 2L oil is effectively about USD$1.26 which is cheaper than in SA where it retails at  ZAR28 -ZAR39 ie USD$1.26 to USD$2.60. When a retailer hikes the import stuff they also price the other closer to there - esp as they consider it might change anytime

Scotland has so much to offer that's why 'The Vow' was used to dupe a nation with fear and false promises

Won't somebody please think of the arms dealers and the oil companies?

7101 2018-10-08 12:35:21 when the crude oil prices were between $30-$35 why did the govt like any matured govt not step up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)? easily the govt could have stored it for a year or 2. Isnt the govt responsible for the loss of opportunity?

7152 2018-10-08 12:28:52 The only sure way to know how much they are actually charging is to grab a 2 litre cooking oil, go to the till and pay. After paying they give you a receipt that tells you the name of store, date purchased and price of the item. These archive pics and tweets won't suffice.

ENTIRE FISCAL PRUDENCE PLUS LOT MORE IS BECAUSE OF LOW OIL PRICES. your management is poor.

7288 2018-10-08 12:11:23 Oil and fossil fuels are subsidized far far more than renewables. 3.3 Billion a year in just Canada. 100 billion if you add other developed nations. Just a single year of that kind of subsidizing would build enough renewables to power Canada for 100s of years.

7318 2018-10-08 12:08:00 These are all good ideas but the infrastructure is not there yet for electric/Hyrohen cars & they’re not cheap to buy. Oil tycoons won’t want to see their sales down. If this is to take off we need bigger Gov support & probably we’ll have to fork out more. But it needs to be done

7320 2018-10-08 12:07:34 Finance and Petroleum Ministers weeping on high prices of crude oil in intl mkt. During 2011-2014 crude oil price  was 100-120 US$/barrel. Petrol & diesel in India Rs.71 & 57 respectively then.  Now Intl crude price 86/barrel. petrol Rs. 90 and diesel 80. Helping private oil Cos.
7321 2018-10-08 12:07:17 12 countries in Europe with smaller GDP , even excluding oil.

The cant go it alone argument is nonsense , the UK remnants with fraction on seeing it for themselves - thats the problem , and reason for prevention by 3 political parties registered in England.
7322 2018-10-08 12:07:15 The oil and gas is suddenly not quite the top notch asset.
But still plenty of other benefits.
We could and should be massive exporter of renewable technologies, if we could get the investment from university research thru to global companies

7388 2018-10-08 12:00:15 Trump took Iranian oil off the market, and is allowing United States producers of oil to export oil FROM the US.  It's our damn oil, IMHO!
7389 2018-10-08 12:00:12 Beloved country? What to love about that shithole country except for all its oil?
7390 2018-10-08 12:00:11 Reduce tankers and trucks. Support local shops and producers.
Cheap or free public transportation.
Electricity cheaper then oil or gas heating
Support nuclear power, until better option is developed.
Is it that hard?
7391 2018-10-08 12:00:03 Good morning! My Manic Monday Special is 25% off any tincture (excluding CBD oil) that is not already discounted.
7392 2018-10-08 12:00:03 Today I dropped. #Oil #Brent 82.97$ (-1.08)
7393 2018-10-08 11:59:58 Given the dire situation that we are heading towards, it's a relief that our Climate Action and Energy Commissioner was CEO and shareholder of an oil company a few years ago. He really knows the ropes!

7397 2018-10-08 11:59:39 So there are so many factors making these shops hiking prices, but the other question is how are shops managing to hike the cooking oil price, these days its very rare to find a big shop with no merchandisers from manufacturers and suppliers, who is hiking the price?

7400 2018-10-08 11:59:21 Good day sir, I can say emphatically that Nigeria lost it first after the advent of oil exploration our leaders lacked the vision to save for future generations, they were over whelmed by the financial wealth been garnered from oil exploration, secondly the massacre as a result

7408 2018-10-08 11:57:06 In those same 20 years, campaigns and press against mountaintop removal (coal), tar sands (oil), fracking (oil and gas), palm oil (biofuel) have been just as bad or worse. Yet those sectors have managed to grow substantially. How come?
7409 2018-10-08 11:56:59 I was always a supporter until I read that you approved drilling for 21,000 oil and gas wells. How can you call for radical change and simultaneously be  part of the problem?  Do you have any explanation for talking out both sides of your mouth?
7410 2018-10-08 11:56:57 So why isn't the price of gasoline and engine oil going down?

7415 2018-10-08 11:55:55 And who will pay for that? The basic call is for total change from coal/oil/gas to wind/solar. Despite the fact that there's just not enough land area to achieve that, and you still have huge reliability & efficiency deficiencies, the cost is way beyond even the USA's wallet.

7427 2018-10-08 11:54:24 I dont think they're truly in denial. I think they're probably embarrassed that they got bamboozled by a snake oil salesman. I've been pushing the whole, "its OK. He's a hustler. I get it. Now just step up and help us vote him and his Klan out of here."

7489 2018-10-08 11:48:17 This will send a lesson to those who hoarded cooking oil at higher prices. We are telling them that there is no need to hoard basic commodities. The country has adequate supplies. Hoarding is simply creating artificial shortages

7496 2018-10-08 11:47:35 Hope you are alright by now.

The detergent should then get off the oil (that should have dissolved the capscin)

7530 2018-10-08 11:43:54 Ensco Plc agreed to acquire Rowan Cos Plc for about $2.4 billion, marking the offshore oil drilling industry’s second big deal in just over a month as higher oil prices drive a recovery in demand.
7531 2018-10-08 11:43:52 Sir, it’s bitter truth that oil is no longer self sufficient for us in this country and diversification of economy has being only a talk of the mouth. How do you plan to make Nigeria self sufficient?
7532 2018-10-08 11:43:37 Exactly... Priced for disaster but with gigantic upside..price of oil not priced in.... Nor the de-risking of the whole basin... Nor the proximity to China.... Nor the fact it isn't deep water, off shore... I could go on but don't wanna be boring 
7533 2018-10-08 11:43:32 Vegetable oil + pot = brownies and cure. Your welcome
7534 2018-10-08 11:43:17 US stock futures are down from  0.3% for the Dow and S&P to down 1.3% for the Nasdaq. Europe and Asia are also negative. Oil is $73.39 and gold is $1,198. This feels like a day for a second donut and an extra cup of coffee.
7535 2018-10-08 11:43:00 Definitely gotta get a oil change when I get off
7536 2018-10-08 11:42:57 So what I'm getting at is
Your on track ok
Don't worry too much
Try to make it up
To balance your books
Oil came down to 73.50

7565 2018-10-08 11:39:13  I came back from the store shortly ago - now cooled down,

There was a haze over the parking lot I thought came from a fire in the shopping mall yeah, like maybe cooking oil that was now under control. Turns out the school had burned down overnight!!

7575 2018-10-08 11:38:28 These recovery contracts were also glad-handed to companies like Mammoth Energy to the tune of a billion dollars.

And Mammoth had no background in that area - their background was drilling for oil.

7581 2018-10-08 11:37:26 why the warning to the international community? 
Is Libya not from Libyans? Is the process not in the hands of Libyans? and will closing the oil not bring bigger problems to the Libyans? How can this be the solution?
7582 2018-10-08 11:37:24 u know you wouldnt need to any warzone heroes if you wouldnt invade other countries for oil
7583 2018-10-08 11:37:21 Yes, a dab of oil will patch the problem. But depending on the status of the MK3 there are things to do to actually resolve the MK3 PP interaction. Namely upgrade to R3 extruder parts, hotter extruder (true of PP in general due to the HTPLA resin) & slow down a bit in the slicer

7596 2018-10-08 11:36:03 Cannabis oil has all the harmful THC's removed from it. There are no side effects...well...unless you include getting better a side effect.  It's strange that cannabis oil is now being offered on prescription to some people who suffer from debilitating illnesses.

7627 2018-10-08 11:32:38 That's an inaccurate statement. Cooking oil is used is SA. To the extent of cooking pap with it in some cases. Particularly KZN.

7793 2018-10-08 11:12:18 Yes, the fracking issue isn't mentioned, but that's anyway been super-ceded by a USA/SA alliance with respect to controlling oil prices. So the article is right in that respect. Venezuela is the biggest casualty (which the USA is most pleased about).

7877 2018-10-08 11:00:25 Norway is 11th in GDP per capita terms. 
It’s really a standard of living index.
Norway has a huge Oil Fund created during periods of surplus revenue when the Price was high. This is an opportunity not taken by UK but would be likely to be followed by an Indy Scottish government.

7879 2018-10-08 11:00:14 Of course there is a cure. They won't market it as the big pharmaceutical companies would lose billions each year and go bust. That's why they say prevention is better than a cure..human life means nothing to them but money does.
Cannabis oil is the answer.
7880 2018-10-08 11:00:02 The issue is not cooking oil is in abundance only. It's wiser not to keep money. Better buy products. Therefore revisit the concept of demand and supply.

7945 2018-10-08 10:50:25 So you can make room for the effects of new technologies, in making more of the oil reserves exploitable, but it's unworldly to expect it, ever, to be an "infinite supply".

7951 2018-10-08 10:49:43 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @TheJusticeDept @FBI IMO many US Taxpayers have been asking for years why Sulzberger & NYT never report about US Religious Groups members getting near Tax Exempt Status while trading Diamonds,Gold,Real Estate,Insurance, Tobacco,Oil,Weapons,etc.& worldwide.
7952 2018-10-08 10:49:40 The problem with british socialism is that it relies on starving net exporting, oil rich Scotland to subsidise an unsustainable rUK economy. They lied about our wealth so that we could have poverty, food banks & low life expectancy. They call it solidarity, I call it colonialism.

Come on pumpkin head, do it. I dare you. You are nothing more than a snake oil man, a pretender to the presidency.
7973 2018-10-08 10:47:30 I read somewhere else that it is a global domino effect that somehow started from oil prices done by other countries and so the mishandling from our govt made it worst. Its too technical and id been asking the same question. Wish someone could explain it in laymans term

7985 2018-10-08 10:44:41 First off their economy  isn't doing all the that much better, he didn't bring a miracle, their economy was already good and they  started selling  oil  (which is what added to our recession). He's largely reaping off an already great system  that wasn't him
7986 2018-10-08 10:44:40 The Left media in general wont talk about how fake Left people at Standing Rock were mercenaries, agent provoceters, infiltrators and informants helping out the FBI, the local police, the oil company and i think also the CIA.
7987 2018-10-08 10:44:29 The mistakes of the past are meddling in other countries business, in the name of human rights when it's actually about wealth from oil, overthrowing unpopular regimes in the name of democracy, for the same reasons, and destabilising a whole region in the process

8034 2018-10-08 10:39:26 Some profit-taking in the priceof oil - global growth concerns as well as Trump’s anger at high oil prices surely means we are near the top after the sharp rise from Jan 2016 under $30 a barrel to the current price. Throw in the fact USD much stronger too now than in 2016.

"When" is the critical bit

If one says it will run out in 1,000 years, it becomes, for all practical purposes, an infinite source of energy

Peak Oil Supply is not something we will witness

What we WILL witness is Peak Oil Demand

Big Oil is already prepping for it

Current estimates of recoverable oil, with current technologies, at current levels of demand, should last us more than a century

Long before that we are going to hit peak oil DEMAND

Solar PV is already competing with coal on price alone in India

Its a revolution!
8085 2018-10-08 10:30:22 Political dynasty is part of the problem. Would Michelle (like Clinton, Bush, her husband & Trump) continue the increase in military spending & drone murder (98% of those killed are not the target) or the pipeline building, oil wars & climate bunkerism? 

Yes. Yes she would.

8120 2018-10-08 10:24:03 realize that key sources of our remittances have been undergoing economic downturn ever since oil prices collapsed.

8123 2018-10-08 10:23:38 Peak Oil theory is a bit more sophisticated than just the current supply-demand situation (demand has collapsed (at the margin) over recent years) whilst short term supply increased by shale etc. This is the short term cyclical noise around the long term trend.

8223 2018-10-08 10:07:36 Most unfortunate, we Indians followed  wastern culture in the name of development 
and discouraged domestic skill & expertise, created huge unemployed & financial setback. Hike of oil price & devaluation of Indian rupees is a clear cut examples. What is use of foreign

8229 2018-10-08 10:06:08 That is rubbish. @campbellclaret was caught out peddling the polls wanted to #Remain or another referendum. When fact checked as per usual he was found out to be the snake oil salesman we all know he really is. The polls said Remain would win and trump would lose #brexit
8230 2018-10-08 10:06:05 Yes it makes our products more expensive olivine oil is more expensive than SA dlite
8231 2018-10-08 10:05:31 People will throw this on Trump, but you can go back decades with this story.. perhaps Gore would have made a difference,  which was why the oil industry backed W was awarded the Presidency illegally
8232 2018-10-08 10:05:28 Honey, typically with tea is the best thing. Gargling with warm salt water is another options but not as good in my opinion. Lastly if you have any peppermint sprays/ essential oil to breathe in.

Surely renewable fuels are the way.
There are e.g. over 5000 oil plants, some grow on desert-like soils, or in mixed-fruit cultivation
As part of a renewable energy mix.

Many suggest electric: they don’t realise when batteries run out, you don’t have power until the last drop!
8389 2018-10-08 09:40:26 It is. One has to work backwards to Oil, in watercolour, it is lights first then darks; in in oils, draks first then lights with the added advantage of opaque coverage. A painter who can "drive his car backwards AND forwards" is a master.

8445 2018-10-08 09:35:26 Chavez nationalised vast swathes of the economy, which made it incredibly inefficient and unproductive.

8490 2018-10-08 09:27:45 You can find many recipes of homemade scrub over the internet (basically coconut oil, brown sugar, jojoba oil etc.) or just buy something like Crabtree & Evelyn.

8493 2018-10-08 09:27:16 They BLOCKED me, when I called out the unfair practice of Indy schools getting regular season games in Lucus Oil. Funny, the very next year Snider and Homestead were invited to have a regular season game in that venue.
8494 2018-10-08 09:27:01 Or nominate someone at mid off with beard oil on his beard
8495 2018-10-08 09:27:00 ^^^ Winner, winner, chicken dinner. Strengthens Putin's economy, which was nearing collapse prior to abandoning the Iran deal, and increases US oil profits.
8496 2018-10-08 09:26:57 Oil+spa gloves (plastic ones are valid too), wear them overnight or any time you don't need to use hands that much. You may need to use scrub first to get better effect if your callus is thick.
8497 2018-10-08 09:26:40 ADVISORY: Petron will implement the following price increases (VAT incl) effective 6 a.m. tomorrow, October 9: P1.00/li for gasoline, P1.45/li for diesel and P1.35/li for kerosene. These reflect movements in the international oil market. Thank you.

8501 2018-10-08 09:26:15 Oh- he’s found oil like Norway?   He’s going to get huge EU subsidies like Slovenia?
8502 2018-10-08 09:26:03 How quickly you resort to insults rather than debate... but still... can I take it from your response then that you wouldn’t be happy for Shetland to have independence if it took the bulk of the N.Sea oil revenue? 
8503 2018-10-08 09:25:51 Huwag mong isisi sa lahat  kabayan talo ang gasoline is the roots

8505 2018-10-08 09:25:43 `bbcnews Are electric bikes restricted so as to protect the oil industry.E.g. pedal powered bikes are permitted to travel faster than e_bikes which are limited to 20mph and power is limited INSTEAD of having speed limiters fitted.Yet again the uk fails to fight global warming!
8506 2018-10-08 09:25:43 We can also talk about moisturizers and lotions if you like.  There's a similar situation there. Most are 98% aqueous cream with a little fragrance and (maybe) a few drops of another oil.  So why does aqueous cream cost R20 for 500g, and branded moisturizer R1000 for 60g?

@cofairstores in Meadville, PA. let me do that. But now that I moved to Oil City, PA. they don't do that hear!

8512 2018-10-08 09:24:11 Norway can afford these kind of indulgences. It is among the richest countries in the world thanks to .... oil.
8513 2018-10-08 09:23:43 Does this might affect more for ongoing price rise of oil for domestic consumer ?
8514 2018-10-08 09:23:36 Olive Oil !!!!!!!!! Please go find Popeye and sweetpea, go home and leave the politics to the adults. You do make me laugh though.

8523 2018-10-08 09:21:07 I agree. You will need to write a happy poem now.
8524 2018-10-08 09:21:06 Why are the fuel Prices increased when crude oil prices are down today ?
8525 2018-10-08 09:20:57 Higher Oil prices, another job done well for Putin

Trump keeps strengthening Putin's economy instead of sanctioning it for the Russian cyber attacks and hacks

It all makes sense.

In case you need arguments against GOP voters, this is one, for more, and more in depth, just ask.
8526 2018-10-08 09:20:51 I saw a job advertised as a fanny waxer.

'Remove knickers, prepare and wax fanny & rub in oil after waxing'

I asked the Job Centre & they said I had to go to Cornwall! - I asked why... is that where the job is?

No, they said - that's where the back of the fucking queue is!

8535 2018-10-08 09:19:41 If I'm remembering correctly at some point it was no longer allowed to cross the boader with cooking oil, is that still the case?
8536 2018-10-08 09:19:36 The United State would probably go back to fracking more shale to crash the global oil price..,and the resultant effect from it would be dealt with the world over
8537 2018-10-08 09:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
8538 2018-10-08 09:19:25 Trump is making sure that happens by lessening restrictions on auto and factory emissions, and taking away our National Parks to put in pipeline s for oil. TRUMP DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. Don't fool yourselves by thinking he does!

8545 2018-10-08 09:18:52 #UKOG RNS out this morning showing Solo Oil are selling their stake. They will sell into any rise, so now for me is an excellent time to top up shares as the price will likely kick on from these levels once the sellers clear.
8546 2018-10-08 09:18:26 It’s weird watching apocalyptic churches partner with corrupt super rich abusers to bring abut Armageddon via oil.
8547 2018-10-08 09:18:08 Scotland has voted labour for almost my entire lifetime.........its the reason we are the poorest oil producing nation on Earth
8548 2018-10-08 09:18:07 Babes, you can get any products with retinol in them (Neutrogena has a range). If you can’t find retinol, you can use a vitamin a oil. The Body Shop should stock that

8571 2018-10-08 09:14:27 That meant no items getting sold overseas, no major mining operations or the like selling the resources of Australia onto the world market. Or no need to import items like oil or the like into Australia since all needs would be meet by Australia internally with no outside stuff.

8575 2018-10-08 09:14:13 100% agree and the whole thing about the 200 dollars, your a Simmions with a oil and gas trust . No one thinks you only have 200 dollars.

8603 2018-10-08 09:09:09 Also major problem is current system focus on short term - same for business and government. Doesn’t really allow focus on greatest underlying challenges like climate change as everyone too busy with next day, week, month, quarter. Plus the right wing crazies and oil lobby obvs.
8604 2018-10-08 09:09:08 He’s also a director of Larus Energy, an oil company operating in PNG. He doesn’t want fossil fuels but profits from their exploitation. Hewson’s principal interest is Hewson’s bank account. Hypocrisy, thy name is Hewson.

Him: For myself na, I no get skin?

You should be ashy and proud, dude. You didn't get the memo?

8622 2018-10-08 09:06:45 Shame the Scottish people didnt get their independance,their economy would be tits up now that "Our Oil" is now only $80 a barrel and all Salmonds figures were done at $130! (By the way what ever happened to Salmond?)

8633 2018-10-08 09:04:23 Market sources report that ExxonMobil will be increasing its API Group I, II and II+ base oils by 20 cents/gal on October 10 due to steeper crude oil and feedstock costs.

8636 2018-10-08 09:03:47 On petrochemicals 'NonEnergy', our @DNVGL @ETO forecast differs. There is no oil growth to 2030 and sharp decline to 2050, 'NonEnergy' however shows very modest decline after 2030.

8643 2018-10-08 09:02:40 #FTAfrica Ghana has two choices around oil: export it as crude or use it to transform our economy, through value-added activities (refining), and using it to create assets rather than to consume, and accrue debt. @NAkufoAddo
8644 2018-10-08 09:02:23 Forgot my hair is past my boobs now. This is important to remember if you're going to do an oil show :|
8645 2018-10-08 09:02:16 I cut my spuds in thirds as well, but at funny angles to make the largest surface area I can. I'm also happy to do this boiling bit early and leave the spuds draining in the colander. This means they don't spit when put in the hot oil.
8646 2018-10-08 09:02:10 AuntyJi , oil prices crashed during the first 4 years of Modi...He pocketed all of 11 lakh crores utilizing the dips in crude by raising excise...Now that oil is up he doesn't know how to manage prices..All the hugs he gave Trump was wasted I guess.

8650 2018-10-08 09:01:37 bikes are good for local economies too - less money going out to car/oil/insurance companies, more disposable income that tends to stay in the area.
8651 2018-10-08 09:01:09 A bagger that quit last year to go work in the oil and gas industry got fired so he came back to Kroger. He’s newly engaged yet still feels the need to hit on his female coworkers.  like boy you need to get your shit together. 
8652 2018-10-08 09:00:56 Let’s be clear oil wealth allows Scots to have more tax sprain them than the English. Scots receive about 50% of EU moneyback in grants & it was Scots MPs that created UK workers rights long before the EU - do your research first

8658 2018-10-08 09:00:17 @DimplexUK I've just tried to order an oil filled heater from your website to my business address. I live in Scotland in postcode IV43 8QR and am told you can't deliver to this postcode! Why? As a small business I ship goods all over the country AND all over the world!
8659 2018-10-08 08:59:55 We ‘humans’ deserve it! We are dumb as F! As long as Big Oil pays politicians we won’t do anything to fight climate change!
8660 2018-10-08 08:59:54 And the reason it won’t happen is money. Money from oil, money from car manufacturers and money from an ever-more privatised health service who treat inactivity-related health issues (diabetes, heart conditions) which are associated with car dependency

8670 2018-10-08 08:58:08 Boss first remove the daily variable pricing scheme!!! When Brent was $35 disthe oil companies reduce the price.. no then why daily pricing should exist ?? No transparency in pricing to common public. Stop exporting fuel to other countries at lower price.

8710 2018-10-08 08:50:54 If they agree to the parallel market rates, then prices must change to adapt that. There are certain items that are still pegged at 1:1, like bread, milk, mealie meal, sugar, cooking oil.

If shops adjust "officially", the man on the street won't afford & unrest will kick in

8713 2018-10-08 08:50:28 Really!!  crude was at a historic high of 125$ during the UPA final days...Remember the Oil bonds which the UPA issued to cover the losses of the oil PSUs..If they were raising excise duty along with crude  the price would have crossed 150 per litre..
8714 2018-10-08 08:50:20 Sure and 30 years ago Big Oil told us it was technically impossible to remove lead from petrol. And 60 years ago Big Pharma swore thalidomide was safe. And DDT ... approved for use by regulators. How did they all end up? #RoundUp #Monsanto

8724 2018-10-08 08:47:51 That is why we don't have a range of products, everything is made to order depending on the circumstances. I would encourage farmers to grow their own bulk ingredients (Oats, Beans, Linseed, Peas, etc) and then the budget can afford the high value legumes, oil radish, etc.

9044 2018-10-08 07:49:42 Crude Oil sells $85/barrel and exchange rate is N360/$. $85 X N360= N30,600/barrel. Under GEJ Crude oil sold at $110/barrel and exchange was N150/$. $110 X N150= N16, 500/barrel. This means Buhari earns almost double the amount GEJ earned in crude oil export. We can't be deceived
9045 2018-10-08 07:49:39 Current oil price = $85 a barrel

Cost of production = $15 a barrel

Do the arithmetic, Norway was making $10 billion a year in tax even when the price was collapsed to $50 a barrel.
9046 2018-10-08 07:49:32 SO MUCH OIL THAT NOTHING HURTS

9056 2018-10-08 07:48:31 Saudi Arabia has huge potential beyond oil. Young Saudis are well-educated, resourceful, energetic - and good-looking! So why on earth would Saudi Arabia want to taint its reputation by detaining non-violent bloggers, journalists and woman activists??
9057 2018-10-08 07:48:28 The major problem with the President Buhari's Government is that they continue to see Oil as the only source of revenue to the Nation rather than see the Oil as a Bonus. 
No wonder the Government has not been able to think out of the box to discover other sources of revenue
9058 2018-10-08 07:48:27 How, are we so sure, PDP as a party will do things, differently this time around. They had 16, corrupt pervasive yrs in power, when the price of crude oil was at peak.. We shouldn't forget quickly that these guys were the "emperors" 3/yrs ago.
Is Atiku now the "MESSIAH"?
9059 2018-10-08 07:48:20 Use cooking oil and salt
9060 2018-10-08 07:47:59 No argument there.

9061 2018-10-08 07:47:56 I am hopeful that the Supreme Court will do the right thing and release and acquit Asia Bibi.

9063 2018-10-08 07:47:45 Now that oil prices is / has gone up the Nigerian govt @NGRPresident will not talk about it or use the proceeds to make better things happen. If it's the other way round, we would have heard pump price increase. God will help us in #Nigeria

9069 2018-10-08 07:46:52 so whats the point of limiting people to buy one bottle of cooking oil per person ini ndiine mari yacho yekutenga akawanda
9070 2018-10-08 07:46:33 On Nigeria earning its money from crude oil, @KundiMusa says, 
"Our political leaders are helpless. If you cannot determine the price of your product, how can you plan on what you want to use the product for?"

Share your thoughts on #TheMorningMojo with @buchionyegbule!
9071 2018-10-08 07:46:30 Someone is on the payroll from the oil companies  @LBC @NickFerrariLBC
9072 2018-10-08 07:46:22 ahh, it’s listed first thing in your twitter bio so i figured it was yours. my plan is to basically live on coconut oil and coffee and multivitamins for about 30 days
9073 2018-10-08 07:46:12 The narrative is set by a media which receives much advertising revenue from the oil industry and its friends. It is also a media whose ownership is closely wedded to owners of the oil industry.
9074 2018-10-08 07:45:03 Managing!  Oh I think we’ll manage on with Europe’s largest oil reserve.  One of Europe’s largest fishery regions and the revenue from all of our whisky!  We’ll be fine thanks :-). But please keep telling us we won’t!  You’re helping independence beautifully!  X

9078 2018-10-08 07:44:35 All antibiotics have been deactivated by the high temperature oil ;-)
9079 2018-10-08 07:44:25 Because figurative snake oil apparently wasn’t enough.

9081 2018-10-08 07:44:10 Dear @MBuhari @AsoRock, hope you are aware of the increase in the price of crude oil per barrel now, and here's hoping that it impacts positively in the lives of the Nigerian citizens whom you told to be patient because the price of oil crashed. Thank
  ...... Concerned Nigerian
9082 2018-10-08 07:43:53 If Scotland had voted yes last time, the drop in oil prices would have bankrupted them by now.

9089 2018-10-08 07:42:49 This should be done. But I am unsure if they would work on it as Crude Oil Imports and then their sale in India gives a huge profits to Indian Govt. So no political party will accept this. But genuinely we need this ASAP.

9096 2018-10-08 07:41:05 @GreenpeaceUK @Greenpeace Wondering if you can help me understand a bit more: when it comes to the palm oil industry, are these groups any good: "Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil" and "Retailer Palm Oil Group"? Many thanks!
9097 2018-10-08 07:40:58 Shell are a pretty big and growing investor in PV tbf. They realise that the oil side of their business is short lived- need corporations like them to make wholesale change.

9113 2018-10-08 07:38:45 It's no more Zero, it's now $28 billion....FYI, this regime had the highest resources available in the history of our country. We are now producing and exporting highest barrels of crude oil for years since no militant attacks to disturb production.

9116 2018-10-08 07:37:18 make a simple pan fried quesadilla, but sprinkle curry powder on the cheese before you close it up to cook it, and fry it in a looot of oil, so that the  quesadilla puffs up and gets kind of like a puri bread :d

9124 2018-10-08 07:35:02 As people tend to blindly respond to what's easy and attractive, it's the responsibility of organisations who provide services that damage the climate (mainly oil and meat) to cease those. #SR15 #ipcc
9125 2018-10-08 07:34:57 honnêtement pour que des sephorettes me demandent ce que je fais je pense ça doit marcher : nettoyer sa peau tous les jours avec neutrogena et bien hydrater matin et soir (et une fois par semaine masquée au blanc d’œuf ça fait briller) et l’huile bio oil enlève les cicatrices
9126 2018-10-08 07:34:50 Their oil $$ to dangerous dictators and business relationship with them is a major cause of instability. They're too corrupt to care, they finance the civil wars then they have to deal with the refugees and terrorists that the civil wars produce
9127 2018-10-08 07:34:34 Roasted with a little honey and olive oil parsnips, carrots and turnips are lovely. Maybe a little thyme, too.
9128 2018-10-08 07:34:13 And it's probably got Palm oil in it anyway

9130 2018-10-08 07:33:23 I made a nice soup out of a potato, beetroot, onion & some cherry tomatoes that were getting a bit old. 

I chopped & cooked the veg with a beef stock cube & water while I roasted the tomatoes in the oven with a bit of olive oil.

Added everything together and blended.

9133 2018-10-08 07:32:18 That is in South Africa. And in South Africa those in diaspora also vote wherever they are. Again whatever you are trying to suggest is not a desirable solution at all. We need cooking oil in the country that's all. Smith never ran shot of cooking oil

9135 2018-10-08 07:31:59 Yes, we better suffer for the next 12 months, setting a good base for the future. Its not sustainable to borrow for fuel and cooking oil. Floating is painful, savings will be lost, but after 1 year it will be progress and progress!
9136 2018-10-08 07:31:54 I still think Ferrari were doing something dodgy, since spa when they was told not to cover the camera anymore they seem to lost their pace, also they are not having the oil smoke like they was....also the pressure from @LewisHamilton can destroy the best drivers @MercedesAMGF1

9139 2018-10-08 07:31:18 And bring Tina to the Hawks' office for stealing out strategic oil reserves. And take Nomvula and her rand, both. And Gigaba. God knows if Nene goes & Malusi stays, that place is broken.
9140 2018-10-08 07:30:36 On the cooking oil prices I blame no one but Zimbabweans panic buying was always going to result in higher prices as manufacturers take advantage of us. 1 guy in pick and pay had 6 5 liter bottles of cooking oil I mean like seriously sometimes we are our own worst enemy
9141 2018-10-08 07:30:36 I like Largo, I was giving you s@#t because you mentioned the ASX (LGO ASX) Longreach Oil...get it?
9142 2018-10-08 07:30:32 I bought cooking oil at $10. Its unfortunate the market is ahead of gvt policy. Government should stop this business of borrowing to finance fuel and cooking oil, we will still pay for it in future and the effects are cyclical. If we float, 1 year is okay to stabilise markets.

No story
9152 2018-10-08 07:28:04 Sounds like the homeless, Oil rig hands, construction workers,security staff etc. firemen...
9153 2018-10-08 07:28:03 Not true only 15% of taxes under control not 100% and before you start mentioning the Barnett formula keep it in mind that it is a partial return on taxes raised in Scotland as well as about 15% of oil revenue returns. Would you be happy with that if boot was on the other foot?
9154 2018-10-08 07:27:41 Fry light is just a marketing gimmick. Get your oil, get one of those little spray bottles for travelling and voila there’s your fry light

9165 2018-10-08 07:26:09 I have always admired Atiku. It is not easy to build a business empire. Atiku is the owner of the biggest logistics company in Africa servicing the oil and gas sector. His partners are big time Italian business men. That company thrives in a sector dominated by multinationals.

9167 2018-10-08 07:25:32 @Shell is a market responsive company, making $12bn profits out of oil & gas. Rather undermines #sustainability claims @BBCRadio4 #IPCCReport #ClimateChange
9168 2018-10-08 07:25:26 The hard decision, is to keep earnings constant. We cant protect the prices of fuel and cooking oil. Lets have them up, we suffer for 6 months to one year but we would have set a very good base for growth and development.

9304 2018-10-08 06:59:16 Oh yes I forgot all that oil that isn’t economical to extract (if there’s any left) and controlled by Brussels (Independence ?.) flying over UK airspace to get there. Suppose you could produce another Arran jumper or two..

9306 2018-10-08 06:59:04 If Trump crashes the US dollar, which it appears he’s trying to do, it’s great for exports such as oil and weapons... not so good for the American people. #WakeUpAmerica
9307 2018-10-08 06:58:23 These are updates of Metro cities . Odisha doesn't have any Metro City . Please update us the smart cities oil prices , then we compare other Smart cities oil prices . @bjd_odisha @farddept @Naveen_Odisha @BJP4Odisha
9308 2018-10-08 06:58:20 Instead of waiting for petroleum prices to come down..better go for CNG, LNG and Electric vehicles..We import 82% crude oil..Very difficult to reudce the crude oil import..Its better to change to Gas rather than importing high value crude oil..
9309 2018-10-08 06:58:16 Medical cannabis oil will be available on prescription in weeks in the UK, with the ministers expected to announce the move in parliament in the next month.

9326 2018-10-08 06:55:52 @Radio702 hi we buy oil and make our own and we have happy clients
9327 2018-10-08 06:55:41 Sometimes lavender essential oil for help sleeping, meditation, reading, showering before bed can help sometimes and some other random things. Not sure if this helps much but it's helped me a bit this last year. 
9328 2018-10-08 06:55:20 i need a good rub down butt ass naked with some oil
9329 2018-10-08 06:55:05 I gotta change my cars oil and I gotta be alive tomorrow..... oh life,
9330 2018-10-08 06:54:43 Greatest damage that will last in history is what Havard has created.. Highly trained Medical Staff or UNI Staff should never have made this gigantic mistake to call Coconut oil a poison... wow.. this has gone viral across the world.. What an embarrassment!!!
9331 2018-10-08 06:54:42 We just spray him with cooking oil.
9332 2018-10-08 06:54:31 Baby oil leah! Works a treat I use it on my hob!
9333 2018-10-08 06:54:30 My god the are so good roasted. Some salt and olive oil, then skip them in a garlic aioli sauce 
9334 2018-10-08 06:54:27 The Ogaden should not allow themselves to be used as pawns in political power games in the region,by groups whose sole aim is greed for power and wealth.The Oil fields in Ogadenia;we hope and pray will bring peace and prosperity,not political turmoil resulting in wars.

9337 2018-10-08 06:53:54 いちろ~っぽい服買えて大満足
9338 2018-10-08 06:53:39 Sorry to report a different experience. Driving Audi for the last year and quite disappointed at the number of workshop visits/stays. They also can’t fix this issue with low oil alarm. Was recommended to open/close hood so the alarm will disappear for 100km... That’s not a joke!
9339 2018-10-08 06:53:30 All this “why doesn’t your man do it for you?” Shit pisses me off. Bitch I wanna change my own oil, wash my own car, put my own gas, etc. why can’t people just mind their own business 
9340 2018-10-08 06:53:09 no Chamisa not desperate.. it's us the masses who are desperate for stuff like fuel, bread, cooking oil and flour..in some countries you don't have to stand in a long que for that.
9341 2018-10-08 06:53:05 Yah I would do all that but you forgot the Coconut Oil! Your body and mine would look extra hot covered in Coconut Oil. That hot as body all shiny and my black skin the same. My BBC slipping up and down your moist slit looking to get in you! 
9342 2018-10-08 06:53:03 That's exactly right on the first seek to understand principle. 

Might be fair to ask Mark Scholz to precise his sweeping statement.  Not fair to dismiss it with another sweeping statement when there is prima facia support for Canada being the best at oil & gas development
9343 2018-10-08 06:52:35 See. I've never done it, never will. We will keep doing hot water and peppermint oil and EVERYBODY WILL BE FINE.
9344 2018-10-08 06:52:34 @ManojTiwariMP @AmitShah Why is BJP not doing agitation against @ArvindKejriwal delhi govt as his government is not ready to reduce petrol prices. He is enjoying 30 percent vat on oil.
9345 2018-10-08 06:52:00 Diverting funds for their hospitals, Yea ok. Why not use that $25,000,000 to help Americans with our healthcare? Why is it our responsibility to help the Middle East with their healthcare? They can’t raise the price of oil anymore. We as a country are producing more than them.
9346 2018-10-08 06:51:54 As long as there's oil in the ground. Not enough is gonna happen.

9350 2018-10-08 06:51:06 Na, tweets are not to solve but to remind you about your duties!

You are the 'expert', please tell the nation what will solve the oil price rise. Modi had a gazillion plans before 2014!
9351 2018-10-08 06:50:28 A diet that allows eggs&bacon for breakfast, ribeye and salad for lunch and veggies sauteed in butter at dinner is trhe least restirctive diet for me.
On a dietitian "non restrictive" diet, I was limited for 1 tbsp of olive oil/day, 2 fruits, still no deserts and only lean meats.

9359 2018-10-08 06:48:41 This, and NATO's Baltic presence, is nothing more than a gun to Russia's head. "If we ever decide to protect the PetroDollar, by invading Iran to take Chinese-bound oil offline, and if you oppose us, we will come into St. Petersburg and Murmansk. So don't."

9361 2018-10-08 06:47:57 Two x  oil ideal evojet 150 had been specified. Running with a sequence controller. I just can’t understand why. I still need to check if these run on kerosene as that’s what is available on site
9362 2018-10-08 06:47:51 Maybe so but no one knew for sure if Iraq had these weapons.  But we did know that they harboring terrorist within their boarders.  We had already sent U.S. military for Operation Desert Storm when Iraq invaded Kuwait to steal their oil fields.
9363 2018-10-08 06:47:48 Republicans energized? Americans across party lines will remember how you butch slapped another woman and forced this creep of a judge down our throats. Oh, let’s not forget how gasoline prices are skyrocketing. So much for Trump and the Republican’s claim of oil independence.
9364 2018-10-08 06:47:48 Perhaps its pain in their wallets that is more likely to shake them. Remind them that their home on Sandbanks, their getaway in a Cornish fishing village or the Norfolk Broads will be worth nothing in 30 years and so will all their pensions pots based on oil and coal investments.

9367 2018-10-08 06:47:36 In India, Oil Marketing Companies have been making good profit.Government do not have any control over these companies after certain limits..These oil marketing companies have to join hands with Government  for a stable oil price....That change wont happen in the near future...
9368 2018-10-08 06:47:25 Lauretta very funny ,our president raised 4.5trillion from tax and duty please where is our oil money ,I guess Atiku took it
9369 2018-10-08 06:47:19 "Share the money." And you are educated o. Check the numbers. All the money raised from oil revenues last year wasn't enough to pay wages. And you want to share the money. Nice. Very nice.

9374 2018-10-08 06:46:31 Update on the M6 RTC (J4-4a). Luckily, a very minor injury collision. Carriageway currently closed so vehicles/oil spills can be dealt with.
9375 2018-10-08 06:46:29 So we are all going to die if we don’t deal with global warning & stop using coal & oil asap. Impossible with current global population growth & lack of enoigh acientific breakthroughs for viable alternatives. Bring back China style 1 baby rule to start?

9425 2018-10-08 06:38:56 But it's not, though. Deep Horizon, oil spills in African nations, unabated plastics pollution, acidification and temperature increase due to GHG emissions. I find it futile too, given peer-reviewed scientific research and facts that there is a debate at all.

9441 2018-10-08 06:35:23 I've been having trouble sleeping so my roommate suggested I try her essential oil mix in my diffuser (I've only ever used eucalyptus or peppermint in it before). 10 hours later I drag my ass out of bed and actually read the label. Apparently, lavender actually works.

9502 2018-10-08 06:24:54 The increase in petrol prices by UPA was done following a 14.5 per cent rise in crude oil prices and a 3.2 per cent devaluation of the rupee. As then Gujarat CM now  PM had termed the hike in petrol prices as "a prime example of the failure of the Congress-led UPA."

India signed billions of deal with Rushya   so strong is our economy 

Never expect "freebies"(subsidised oil) from Modi 

That's why we love Modi

Just get out of Syria immediately. Pack up your bags and get OUT. USA are a rouge nation. And overrun by the Military Industrial Complex.

9542 2018-10-08 06:18:14 But @HeatherRoyNZ as the price goes up (b. the NZD falls or the oil price goes up) the #excise (a fixed dollar amount per litre at entry or production) goes down as a #percentage.

That's a lower #tax #rate isn't it?

Lower tax rates are good, right?

9648 2018-10-08 06:01:14 The only problem with the oil argument is the amount of other countries that also have oil but could not manage it properly and most are nowhere near Saudi in exporting it.

9716 2018-10-08 05:50:16 if you cook it right you shouldn’t taste it at all... nun gross about it ,it’ll be like cooking with reagular oil or water only it gets you high 
9717 2018-10-08 05:50:07 Your entire take is 

"i didn't get discriminated against, so from my place of privilege, get over it. Also bc I'm a gay man i think I have a right to comment on trans issues"

You have a right to an opinion sure

But I have a right to call you out for a shitty opinion too.
9718 2018-10-08 05:49:56 If 90% of the SA population don't use cooking oil, we don't expect to see it in abundance in every shop

9720 2018-10-08 05:49:41 To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, however for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
9721 2018-10-08 05:49:28 Just read about CBD oil for two hours

9724 2018-10-08 05:48:54 And even stupider still is that the oil companies could just rebrand as energy companies & lead the way. The competitive advantage they’d have (especially vs others doing this instead anyway) if they developed the technology would keep them profitable for decades if not centuries

9729 2018-10-08 05:48:23 Dang. The wars for oil arent over yet and we’re gonna be on to the wars for water.

9736 2018-10-08 05:48:03 I have videos of two such events in my fone. I also have another one of people fighting for cooking oil.

9739 2018-10-08 05:47:14 You really can’t add everyone to your friend group lol. Oil & water don’t mix...
9740 2018-10-08 05:47:06 The Saudi rulers are no friends to America. But in all fairness the United States wouldn't give a damn about any country in the Middle East if there weren't so much oil in the ground there.
9741 2018-10-08 05:47:03 Dr. Duffer what is oil bonds & why were they issued in UPA 2??
9742 2018-10-08 05:47:00 Chef Gusteau cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with hot sauce.

9745 2018-10-08 05:46:38 It's preposterous to keep borrowing when we sell 2.1mbpd of crude oil  at $76 in the oil sector alone. Excluding revenue from taxes and duties and that is recipe for subjugation to foreign currency and external influence. I stand for a proactive entrepreneurial government
9746 2018-10-08 05:46:36 @IndianOilcl - to whom ever it may concern this is a complaint for weeks late delivery of lpg gas cylinder and rude behaviour of the employee indian oil (kitchen queen) consumer no. 4249

9748 2018-10-08 05:46:15 Exactly. It's already very difficult to "sell" the value of data and the benefficts of investing in it to the managers of the companies. For example, even in some oil and energy companies (where data is more valuable than gold), setting a ROI for this kind of projects, is an art
9749 2018-10-08 05:46:12 The stupidest thing about this is that the greatest incentives to handle it are capitalist. Developing sustainable green energy would create jobs, stimulate the economy, and also reduce our independence on oil and gas both from here and everywhere else (cough, Middle East).
9750 2018-10-08 05:45:32 #MiracleMonday   Leviticus 8:12  @ApostleMMWangui And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him.  @Sanctified4U

9758 2018-10-08 05:44:48 Yup! And it's my opinion that you're being transphobic! Well, it's anyone's opinion that has sense.
9759 2018-10-08 05:44:37 In the late 90s while working at an oil company I watched our Infrastructure Director, a burly Scottish guy, ask one of our Oklahoma staff if he could bum a fag. It didn’t translate very well.
9760 2018-10-08 05:44:33 Business for hemp oil
9761 2018-10-08 05:44:29 They are doing it as they know that There will be NO Market for Oil & Gas in the coming days ahead as Oil & Gas demand in the World will Fall heavily due to Electric Mobility, Nuclear Energy etc.. Only LPG & Lubrication Oils will have demand..
9762 2018-10-08 05:44:23 In my view, Reuters report is nothing new. Admin officials have already said same on the record. But if you wanted to lower #oil prices, one way would be to create some uncertainty about waivers from oil sanctions & keep market guessing about how much oil comes off the market.
9763 2018-10-08 05:44:19 What I have realised actually in South Africa is that cooking oil is affordable and available such that those who prefer to cook with cooking oil can and those who dont like it leave it
9764 2018-10-08 05:44:14 กูอยู่จุดนี้เพื่ออะไร
9765 2018-10-08 05:43:59 It is so very sad.  Unfortunately as long as we have senators like John Cornyn who has received over $3M from oil and gas I fear greed will win over the planet
9766 2018-10-08 05:43:34 เป็นๆได้เพียงคนที่มีไว้ก็ดี...
9767 2018-10-08 05:43:16 Is it sure that 2 litres of cooking oil cost $25 in Harare
9768 2018-10-08 05:43:07 Hi Simon. Trading S/R zones is going to work on any market that has a good liquidity - other indices, Oil, Gold, EUR/USD,,. The differences is in volatility, since more volatile markets don't respect zones to the tick, like on ES, you can get more false breaks. And no internals.

9770 2018-10-08 05:42:55 It’s a bit pricey but I had a sample of it cosmetics cleansing balm & that was sooo bomb. Now I’m using Burt’s Bees cleansing oil because it had good reviews but if I don’t follow with a cleanser after I can feel the residue. I’m looking into more balms to try soon lol.
9771 2018-10-08 05:42:35 Oil companies will hike prices of diesel, gasoline and kerosene - for more than one peso per liter.
9772 2018-10-08 05:42:28 No $hit! And we have #buffoon in power denying #ClimateChange because they are paid by big oil! And you @CNN have a big responsibility in this because you always play the 50/50 card!
9773 2018-10-08 05:42:17 anyway goodnight to everyone except the oil industry
9774 2018-10-08 05:42:17 The IPO may get delayed. My initial tweet was more in context of high oil price and its impact on India. If MBS survives, he wants a good IPO where his >$2 trillion valuation for Aramco is justified. That doesn't seem good for India's current account deficit.
9775 2018-10-08 05:41:56 Are we still exporting crude oil? How much profit have we made so far? @UKenyatta @HKRotich ..

9781 2018-10-08 05:40:44 And that thread didn't even mention that massive Scottish North Sea elephant in the room.

All the oil fields that we're currently drilling? A good chunk of that stuff has to say down there.

All the new and "new" fields that are being discovered? They ALL need to stay untapped.
9782 2018-10-08 05:40:43 And upwards of maybe $10bn by the end for an oil pipeline no one else will touch. Such a great leader.

9784 2018-10-08 05:40:39 Price per KWH of electricity has increased around 4% total since 2008.  US electricity rates are among lowest in world.  Prices will rise in 2018 due to increased natural gas prices.  I’m no Obama fan, but electricity prices are hardly eye watering. Oil’s up since O left office.

9788 2018-10-08 05:40:22 Lies..Lies....When Nawaz started his Govt, Oil prices per barrel dropped to around 50$ a barrel in International market. Petrol prices were reduced to around 65-70 Rs. CNG was still higher than petrol. I literally took out CNG cylinder from my Car. Now oil price per barrel is 90$
9789 2018-10-08 05:40:20 The alternatives are a bit expensive but healthy like coconut oil , virgin olive oil, lard, butter. cooking oil isn't a healthy option from a cholesterol point of view
9790 2018-10-08 05:40:15 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
9791 2018-10-08 05:40:07 I think president you need to take action on people warikutengesa fuel and cooking oil at $15,5litres 15 mustreet .please be vigilant on that .
9792 2018-10-08 05:39:57 Because elite vampires need to suck the blood of #Haiti, and the oil of #Syria.
9793 2018-10-08 05:39:56 Or on that last one, do you have any dry shampoo in the house? I think those are supposed to work on hair by using a starch to draw oil from the scalp/hair ... but don't quote me on that one.
9794 2018-10-08 05:39:39 Crude oil brent price maintained above $80 even higher today at $85 per barrel compared to last week. Keep growing, boy.

9796 2018-10-08 05:38:56 So nonpolar, meaning alcohols, correct? What about hand degreasers, like if you were working on your car and had that kind of oil, being that capsaicin is a oil? Weak acid like vinegar? Maybe alcohol followed by Dawn/dish soap; repeat? Coat hands with a starch? Cornstarch?

9825 2018-10-08 05:35:07 We are energy independant, gas, oil, nuclear, coal, wind and hydro, I have nothing against renewable, they are inefficient and expensive (for now) we do t need the EU to deal with the “global market” and put tariffs on goods to protect their own, not our interests.
9826 2018-10-08 05:35:02 except that crude oil is up over 50% in the last year and the NZ dollar down some 7% or so. Explains quite a lot!

The fact Eastern Canada is not buying Oil from Alberta and buying more expensive oil from the middle east says a lot. Something that simple could save tons of jobs.

9834 2018-10-08 05:33:43 Motor oil! So bad
9835 2018-10-08 05:33:20 its pretty chaotic at present - won't the wealth stripped group be planning something - he has shaken up too many things at once - first let the dust settle down - Why is the IPO getting postponed - oil prices is a charade - maybe the turmoil might be one of the reasons ?
9836 2018-10-08 05:32:20 Snake oil

9838 2018-10-08 05:32:08 If Malaysia can run Petronas , if thailand can run PTT , if China can Sinopec/petrochina, Saudi can run Aramco then Why can India run ONGC/Indian oil etc efficiently ?? Only reason is Oligarchs have to benefited at the cost of the nation.
9839 2018-10-08 05:32:08 US pressure on oil widen nuclear partnership..

Thanks to an Indira era friendship and a Manmohan era deal! 
9840 2018-10-08 05:31:59 I don't necessarily want oil companies creating super profits doing so, but yeah. High price signals mean "use less fuel". Which I don't have a problem with.

(I realise it's not that simple for many people who live in 'burbs predicated on the use of private cars)
9841 2018-10-08 05:31:47 Sweden is dependent on Russian oil. It has not developed its own resources. Hard to believe that they will join NATO unless an alternative supply of petroleum can be provided by NATO countries at about the same price.

9846 2018-10-08 05:31:09 Why, the Indos would just cut it down and plant palm oil there
9847 2018-10-08 05:30:56 Right? It’s difficult to explain. Pretty liberal in a lot of ways. It’s just the gun thing and all the oil jobs that seem to drive the political agenda.
9848 2018-10-08 05:30:46 Miss Britney shows them VOCALS. We stan DeepVoiceney. Also the fact that And Then We Kiss was randomly thrown onto a remix album is homophobic. So was Canola Oil replaying her on Hey Ma

9853 2018-10-08 05:30:24 I’ve been putting a tea spoon of eucalyptus oil in a bottle of water and putting it on the sauna at my apartment and it’s the gooods I tell ya!
9854 2018-10-08 05:30:18 Well Jacinda agrees that consumers are being fleeced.  Then again politicians have been saying this since the oil shock in 70s
9855 2018-10-08 05:29:44 In other words... “Since I’ll be dead before it matters, I don’t give a crap about my grandkids future as long as big corps can save money on filters that affect the environment and we remain dependent on oil to make me and my rich friends richer”
9856 2018-10-08 05:29:29 Need oil to make panels...
9857 2018-10-08 05:29:22 i need a hot oil FULL body massage.  i’m talking from the tips of my toes to the top of my dome.
9858 2018-10-08 05:29:20 there is interesting trend in oil prices.. they reduce in kal sarp period of 15 days and increases in 1 days outside kal sarp !!
9859 2018-10-08 05:29:08 Judge also said he didn’t remember that party not that he wasn’t there or that there was no party. TBF he said he never saw K try to rape a girl, but this is very different than the snake oil that passes for RW truth you’re selling

9861 2018-10-08 05:27:47 Whole face. I usually use a mixture of coconut & almond oil for my mascara but I don’t like using it on my whole face
9862 2018-10-08 05:27:21 Last I tanked the anti-money-machine, it was about $1.25/liter...sure is good that we don't process or use OUR OWN OIL, instead of selling it to the states at a loss and having THEM refine it and sell it back to us at a FURTHER LOSS...cow nipple extract is $5.50/2 liters! d=^o
9863 2018-10-08 05:27:17 Great job @johnallannamu. I feel there's still alot that need to be revealed esp abt oil&the West. The war in SS is a very well choreographed one&East Africa is acting on someone's behalf too-Asia &the West.

9866 2018-10-08 05:26:32 Not sure race has anything to do with it, but just so you know, Derrick Lewis is not white.
9867 2018-10-08 05:26:31 Drew changed my oil, rotated my tires, and detailed my car while I was at work today. Your mcm could never.
9868 2018-10-08 05:26:24 Smart, like, acknowledging the largest explosion of life happening during the Cambrian period where CO2 levels were 4X higher than today?
Or smart, like, 5X the population than 100 years ago and simply breathing (not evil oil) will inflate your popular hockey stick graph?

9869 2018-10-08 05:26:11 If the global reserve currency, the main trading cur. for resources (oil, gas, etc.), the prime cur. for exchanges and trade, is the cur. of ONE single nation only (US$), all others are depending and vulnerable on that one "nipple", instead of being stronger - united in Ripple.
9870 2018-10-08 05:26:10 Given that the corrupting influence of money on the national government is the direct culprit, what other form of government do you think would be working better? This isn't a partisan issue, oil and fracking blossomed under Obama. The issue is the rich. Full stop.
9871 2018-10-08 05:25:54 Sol not playing out as expected. Last week when oil hit 86$ I thought that flag would rally out for sure.
9872 2018-10-08 05:25:50 Let’s go to oil dale luv
9873 2018-10-08 05:25:49 That oil isn't from Texas it's only stored there. It's purchased on the international market by the US Govt mostly paid for by Blue States I'll add. We will divy that up and cut them lose.
9874 2018-10-08 05:25:45 We better prepare for this Catastrophe, as we have politicians like #TRUMP and oil companies that own politicians. An air and ship industry that can't be shut down. Nothing serious will change until the catastrophe. #ClimateChange #UN
9875 2018-10-08 05:25:36 Cetaphil for face makeup and coconut oil for eye makeup. I like to take my face makeup off first and then my eyes. Then I wash my face again.
9876 2018-10-08 05:25:36 Essence dan serum tu sama slotnya digunakan setelah hydrating toner, pilih yg teksturnya lebih cair dulu ya, setelah itu facial oil lalu sleeping mask
9877 2018-10-08 05:25:31 Kalau aku tetap pakai oil, karna aku pakai sunscreen. Sunscreen wajib double cleansing pakai oil & water
9878 2018-10-08 05:25:07 Yes, the same as we also like hitting ourselves with hammers & drinking Castor oil. As in, not very much at all. Probably good for someone over 60, but how do the young ones get houses or raise kids?
9879 2018-10-08 05:24:59 หนง้หนื่อยฮะ
9880 2018-10-08 05:24:53 Just saw a thing on pinterest for "breakfast tamales." It called for chopped up tamales, bell peppers and garlic, fried in olive oil then topped with fried eggs and sliced radishes... how tf do white people dream up this stuff?!
9881 2018-10-08 05:24:47 Then again, I prefer the baked pita bread in an old mud oven  and cooked by an old woman along with thin cut fresh tomatoe , olive oil and some fresh leef lettuce from the garden....
9882 2018-10-08 05:24:46 Yet to try but oil in lotion dia pun banyak review cakap best. Cleansers are so so, akak dah try yang hydrating dengan yang whitening. Tak rasa bersih sangat. Whitening, breaks me out! Moisturizers dia semua jarang ada negative feedback unless ada allergic.
9883 2018-10-08 05:24:39 Successfully cooked things in hot oil while in my underwear without getting burned #NoRoommateLife
9884 2018-10-08 05:24:19 There’s something everyone arab I was talking about would say“without oil”They can’t bare that Allah swt granted us with this treasure.What I said is extremely true actually because at the end of the day Ive been to manyArab nations and beliefs are the same just different culture
9885 2018-10-08 05:23:45 I believe those who victim-blame Shannan Watts based on her videos and hyperfocus on her behavior are misogynistic & threatened. They are willing to ignore the fact that Chris Watts dumped his children in oil wells just to find anything to blame/demonize/scrutinize her.
9886 2018-10-08 05:23:38 Remember the gvt had to introduce SI 64 to protect local industries before they could manufacture because our cooking oil is more expensive than SA ones. Yes we need to productively use land
9887 2018-10-08 05:23:26 Cuacanya panas banget semingguan ini. Kulit di area hidung mengelupas. Face oil saja tidak membantu
9888 2018-10-08 05:23:13 CBD oil is nice
9889 2018-10-08 05:23:02 Oil prices rise and we sit and watch while everyone from farmers, to traders, white/ blue collar workers and industries suffer. 

No subsidy/ reduction of import tariff on electric vehicles. No investment in bio-fuels. Brazil meets 25% of its needs from bio-fuels! #OilShock

9920 2018-10-08 05:15:15 We are ALL to blame .. we could have had electric cars long ago but the oil companies basically run our economies and the government. After all , where will the government reap all the tax if petrol and diesel is abolished .Maybe charge £10 for a plastic bag.. that’s
9921 2018-10-08 05:15:15 These are Europe's Wars.  We are the biggest customers for that oil.  And Europe is NOT leading way for electric vehicles.

9932 2018-10-08 05:13:43 Oil on high prices. Dollar also high, so putting pressure on markets. Bond rate yield spike in the US causing companies to move into bond funds. Share prices will readjust because of this. That will put pressure on markets. I won't be overexposed to equities right now.
9933 2018-10-08 05:13:39 Does that still stand ? Besides we don’t have the oil states no more plus bad leadership. I don’t see any major change anyways because it would still be the same institutions presiding over government.

9945 2018-10-08 05:12:27 There will be NO Market for Oil & Gas in the coming days ahead as Oil & Gas demand in the World will Fall heavily due to Electric Mobility, Nuclear Energy etc.. Only LPG & Lubrication Oils will have demand..
9946 2018-10-08 05:12:16 I guess even the counties that have dams such as masinga, Kindaruma and others used to generate electricity should also get a 25% cut from KPLC and also Turkana gets 25% of the oil money too, right?

9949 2018-10-08 05:11:50 The technical pathway to avoiding climate catastrophe is clear. Blocking that path are fossil fuel companies and their lobbyists. Let’s not pretend there is a consensus solution to saving the world. Either oil companies have no future or we have no future. #MakeOilHistory

9979 2018-10-08 05:07:39 Because they’re convinced oil has a far worse future than natural gas, yes. Shell has pivoted so much nat gas is a bigger division for them than oil, now. And many are jumping into renewables and EV networks.
