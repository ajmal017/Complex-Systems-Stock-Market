1 2018-01-15 23:59:53 This is why we end up in ridiculous situations like Amber Rudd’s “stop moaning and just do it” mantra toward backdoors in crypto (which are MATHEMATICALLY impossible). “But nah, I want them”

Every member of government should have decent understanding of tech It powers everything
2 2018-01-15 23:59:36 “Crypto” is just distributed ledger technology. A technology, not a business. Like a website. Anyone can use the tech. In some cases, exactly the same tech. I don’t think it should/will take 20 years for folks to figure out whether there’s actually a biz behind the tech.
3 2018-01-15 23:59:34 $xvg has gone down (and in hindsight, wasn't surprising), have used this dip to top up. Could we see 500 sats?
4 2018-01-15 23:59:14 Next Time alors pour parler crypto !  (D'ailleurs ça bouge la faut guetter !)
5 2018-01-15 23:59:13 Bitcoin: €11,077.51

7 2018-01-15 23:58:57 Most boring in crypto: Fiat/USDT
2nd most boring: $BTC

I'm bored...
8 2018-01-15 23:58:32 If you are not on Twitter you are not in crypto!
9 2018-01-15 23:58:17 Instructions unclear, bought bcash..
10 2018-01-15 23:58:13 Seems BTC, once the pioneer, is the reason all the other coins are dragged down? Maybe it's time for exchanges to offer other pairs in lieu of BTC? If BTC collapses due to it being a slower, and more expensive does that mean the entire Crypto world fails and collapses too?
11 2018-01-15 23:58:10 I am only on twitter because of $crypto
12 2018-01-15 23:58:10 if a bank were to ever really use crypto in anyway it would be stable coins like the $dai form @MakerDAO not fucking $XRP that can drop 30% in one day lol XRP never
