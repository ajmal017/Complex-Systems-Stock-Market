36 2018-08-15 23:57:00 Which requires balance IMO.  If you try to go too fast or are all over the place, you lose goo/slime/cooking oil along the way.

46 2018-08-15 23:56:17 You’re comparing pipelines to buggy whips? How do you think it’s transported now? Yes, mostly by rail which is way more expensive. Your comparison to buggy whips and Kodak would be correct if the world suddenly stopped using oil altogether. Not likely, is it?

50 2018-08-15 23:55:17 Prosperity for all is what the Somali people want. Unfortunately, that is impossible when “Somali Government” services only foreign interests and hands fishing, oil and mining sectors, among others, to them. That is not called progress. It is called exploitation.

56 2018-08-15 23:54:26 If you use a non-stick coated pan you hardly need any oil. You could even do no oil. I just stir them a lot while cooking.
57 2018-08-15 23:54:16 That's global economic collapse. Nothing wastes more resources than global collapse. We'd probably burn all our oil just to get the lights back running - and climate change would just hit us twice as hard as it already does.

61 2018-08-15 23:53:43 You can't go wrong with beans, rice, and plantains. Try @TheKitchenista Black bean recipe, and add rice of your choice + coconut oil fried ripe plantains.
62 2018-08-15 23:53:31 Now I want one
63 2018-08-15 23:53:07 I’ve been driving one for two months. It’s a revolution in transportation and big oil is doing all they can to put the genie back in the bottle.
64 2018-08-15 23:52:42 Just grilled an eggplant with olive oil, oregano, red pepper flakes and salt. It came out so good !
65 2018-08-15 23:52:00 After I reach a chapter break during this writing session, I'm allowing myself to make a quick essential oil blend as a distraction.

This chapter's distraction: 2 parts lemongrass, 3 parts eucalyptus, 5 parts peppermint. 
66 2018-08-15 23:51:59 @ElizabethMay  As the $ gap between our WCS + US WTI widens, more rail cars ship Cdn oil south at huge mark-ups.
67 2018-08-15 23:51:59 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
68 2018-08-15 23:51:39 Eww. I don’t know which disgusts me more: the poor guy dying in a vat of oil at Disney.... or the fact that Kellyanne Conway is trending.

I’ve transcended to a better me.
72 2018-08-15 23:50:45 Just simply seizure of the means of production and distribution through government regulation.

73 2018-08-15 23:50:41 Hi you innovative outside-the-box thinker we have a world of information at our fingertips. Ranch dressing is a type of salad dressing made of some combination of buttermilk, salt, garlic, onion, herbs and spices, mixed into a sauce based on mayonnaise, or another oil emulsion.
74 2018-08-15 23:50:33 CoC but had a guy kidnap a baby javelina and jump to the top of an oil derrick in one motion
75 2018-08-15 23:50:31 Killed also implies a mode of death. People have been killed by runaway cars, fireworks, etc. e.g.; the man died when oil & fumes killed him.

81 2018-08-15 23:49:43 I love broccoli. Put some olive oil on it. Salt and pepper. Then broil it. Maybe 5-7 minutes. It’s good.
82 2018-08-15 23:49:38 Update- it has been 47 min since the internet went down. I’m doing ok. Made an oil pastel art and now about to watch Jennifer’s Body on my laptop

88 2018-08-15 23:48:01 Life long glasses wearer here and yep the bloody things need constant cleaning not to be smudge, alcohol based wipes do it best, as they get rid of the oil smudges from skin.

I've not heard of blueblockers though? Are they to help with the light from screens like phones, ect?
89 2018-08-15 23:47:59 Sesame oil is so good
90 2018-08-15 23:47:44 What a terrible way to die, the poor man! And I can’t even imagine what the man who tried saving him is going through, pulling someone out of a deep vat of oil would be next to impossible.
91 2018-08-15 23:47:27 teethache really fighting thru the codeine, ibrupofen and clove oil to make sure i rly feel the pain huh. the spite is staggering
92 2018-08-15 23:47:22 plus stronger oil prices and therefore investment...
93 2018-08-15 23:47:21 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 집이요..? 휑하던데..
94 2018-08-15 23:47:09 Fine. But in real life you’ll also need a gasoline generator. So you won’t be independent of the oil industry.
95 2018-08-15 23:46:51 Nah if he puts a tax on a country for oil it sells cheaper to us and others same as steel
96 2018-08-15 23:46:49 combination skin type- feels oily in the T zone and dry or normal on the cheeks/elsewhere

97 2018-08-15 23:46:34 Butting in to plead that you not suffer through tough chicken -- sear on all sides in oil/butter and pop into the oven for 30 min (375 degrees), will cook through every time and be moist and soft ; 0 ;
98 2018-08-15 23:46:33 So a gold mine is okay but an oil sands mine isn’t? You sure you don’t wanna phase out that gold mine?
99 2018-08-15 23:46:17 Did you finally get your oil changed? 
100 2018-08-15 23:45:46 Combine 1 pound Garlic with 1 pound Guancamole. Add Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve on bread
101 2018-08-15 23:45:46 Steamed broccoli from an Instant Pot is a game changer. Soft as butter and you can put lemon or other seasoning in it if you want added flavor without the calories (instead of butter, oil etc.)!

105 2018-08-15 23:45:10 When the price of steel is low in our country it’s because people are buying steel from other country’s which kills our economy that’s facts just like that little prince that owns the oil, it’s up to him on how much the price of oil will be not nothing a president has done
106 2018-08-15 23:45:08 Abt 60% imports bill comes through oil & petro prods
107 2018-08-15 23:45:06 oily type- feels very “wet” all over

108 2018-08-15 23:44:54 just tried oil. humans are weird.
109 2018-08-15 23:44:50 Here is my subjective thoughts on the EIA inventory report. The build in petroleum inventories (crude oil & petroleum products) was 17.44MMbbls. The build was mainly attributed to movements in net imports (~9.4MMBBls) and the error term (~6MMBbls). Error term going crazy.. #OOTT
110 2018-08-15 23:44:46 So long as he has the evidence to back up his assertions. Especially if he is presenting as a pediatrician....otherwise he is nothing more than a snake oil salesman...is he promoting a book, perhaps?
111 2018-08-15 23:44:14 Trump is a snake oil salesman, several rungs lower than a scam artist. His purge of patriots is unprecedented and dangerous.
112 2018-08-15 23:44:12 America is a bunch of oil companies with a standing army.

116 2018-08-15 23:44:01 Don’t ask the brand of oil because I don’t want anyone else to use it lol
117 2018-08-15 23:44:01 True. The paltry amount of oil we buy from them is virtually useless. We have our own.
118 2018-08-15 23:43:48 growing my hair again so back to my hair rotation , deep conditioning , hair mask , my special growing oil starting tonight 
119 2018-08-15 23:43:44 Take a baked sweet potato & top it with sliced sautéed(in butter or olive oil) vidalia onions, sliced mushrooms & spinach (put it in at the end until just wilted) with a lil sea salt, pepper + garlic (fresh or powder). I sometimes finish it off with a lil shredded parmesan. 
120 2018-08-15 23:43:41 Hence the invasions... I mean regime-changes ...I mean support of insurgents in proxy wars ...errrrhm ...when a nation decides to move away from the almighty US #petrodollar for oil sales.

Ref: #Iraq #Libya #Syria #Iran
121 2018-08-15 23:43:34 It’s just stupid lol. It scratches easily and you gotta rub oil on it. Too high maintenance for me.
122 2018-08-15 23:43:26 I stopped wearing deodorant and have since replaced it with a very expensive oil of Moroccan roses. I think I’ve created a love potion because the mixture of pheromones and roses has stopped literally so many people + Uber drivers complimenting how “amazing!” It smells. 
123 2018-08-15 23:43:15 Er n they are also shutting them n rapidly switch to renewable n electric transportation spending billions on transition. also implementing bigest carbon cap n trade n pricing sys in world

129 2018-08-15 23:42:47 #Koch Industries’ clashes with the federal government were also intensifying. The Department of Energy continued to audit the company for violating federal oil price controls and overcharging retail energy customers.

131 2018-08-15 23:42:41 Who owns the oil
132 2018-08-15 23:42:40 i remember one day i had been drinking a lot but HAD to wash my hair so i made a deep conditioner w| egg, olive oil & honey then sat under the steamer. the steam cooked the egg in my hair 
133 2018-08-15 23:42:38 DO NOT TAKE MONEY FROM THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY! This is immoral and hugely lacks integrity. Do the right thing and keep the prohibition.
134 2018-08-15 23:42:33 Like oil on let’s make it simple
135 2018-08-15 23:42:31 Have you tried putting warm olive oil into it and then some cotton wool? I've no idea if it works but my granny used to always recommend it  Hope it gets better soon xx
136 2018-08-15 23:42:28 #ThingsThatConfuseMe The disney worker fell into the oil vat  and died why there was not any sufficient security railings  surrounding the vat of oil to protect workers on this type of occasion

 Conservatives are supposed to conserve the important things. Oil company profits and US hegemony do not count Leighton. Hydrocarbons are death, not life.
144 2018-08-15 23:41:10 If this is true then this will bring a bright future for the young generation of sabahan. Use the oil and gas money to support young sabahan who can't afford on there study. Sabah might not be the richest state but it will be the well educated state in Malaysia. @JeffreyKitingan
145 2018-08-15 23:41:03 Instead, he backed the imperialists/Zionists in Syria, Funneled and funded extremists throughout the Middle East, And bought and sold oil directly from ISIS. DOES HE HAVE NO SHAME??

150 2018-08-15 23:40:12 you gotta brine it in salt water, cover it in oil and spices, and then bake for a short time on high heat
151 2018-08-15 23:40:07 Finally got my Oil Changed 
152 2018-08-15 23:40:00 This story is crazy x 1000. 

The environmental nutjobs always fight natural gas and oil pipelines. So, that leaves transporting oil and gas over the rails. That wastes energy and is not as safe.
153 2018-08-15 23:39:59 Got my oil changed, and there was a Kroger a few steps away. I drove an extra 3 miles just to go to #Publix and was welcomed 8x and offered assistance 3x.  Caught me a BOGO deal also, as usual. It's ALL about that customer service. They're the Starbucks of grocery stores IMO.
154 2018-08-15 23:39:51 -Worked to promote the sale of U.S products abroad.
-opened plans to lease 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.
-Expanded energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline
-Justice worked with Central American nations to arrest and...5
155 2018-08-15 23:39:47 I believe that you guys are in for a rude awakening tbh. The toxic chemicals and unreliability of solar panels isn’t going to replace oil for a very long time. Our oil consumption haven’t even peaked yet Nevermind decline.
156 2018-08-15 23:39:26 Or like olive oil :P
157 2018-08-15 23:39:24 CASTOR OIL ME PLEASEEEE

161 2018-08-15 23:38:55 @EdKrassen @krassenstein @politicususa @realDonaldTrump American tourists do not come to Ireland telling us how great America is , we know about your poverty , your wars for resources, your support of Saudi killing children in Yemen, your love of dictators you control for oil

164 2018-08-15 23:38:44 Loops where blocked and that’s the reason Nigeria did not turn to Venezuela. Couple with low oil price... Will have lots of project ongoing. GEJ commission many projects none of them was up to 5% completion and full money was released for the projects.
165 2018-08-15 23:38:29 my wife (chinese) here in china was watching #AmericanSniper the other day. we were talking about how hypocritical it was that they make this murdered out to be some sort of hero. wtf is the US doing over in #Iraq anyway?! just stealing oil & a land grab for #Zionist

172 2018-08-15 23:37:54 Should we be worried about the weakness is oil price over the last seven weeks or is this a temporary correction?
173 2018-08-15 23:37:38 I just read the ugly truth about baby oil being crude oil 
174 2018-08-15 23:37:29 Also probably for waste oil.
175 2018-08-15 23:37:11 おおおおおお！
176 2018-08-15 23:37:02 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
177 2018-08-15 23:36:51 Creativity is the best of times. :D

I mean, I was going to use web on that last one to change it up, but a party member started that oil fire so it would have instantly burned away. So, you know, grease fire instead. ;)
178 2018-08-15 23:36:49 @elonmusk I am really shocked that you are taking the company private. I am even more shocked and dismayed that you are taking the money from Big Oil. If you do this, I don't see how I can in good conscience—buy a model 3.

184 2018-08-15 23:36:10 Yes, using CBD oil and anti-seizure med, but since his seizures are caused by a brain tumor, nothing much we can do  but the CBD oil helps calm him down, he also has arthritis, so it helps with pain mgmt too

189 2018-08-15 23:35:36 Ahh beard oil, I never knew I needed you. If you smell coconuts, that’s me and my facial hair.
190 2018-08-15 23:35:30 They even look like snake oil salesman now that you can see them more clearly.
191 2018-08-15 23:35:23 I googled it. There was a woodstock in 67 they named it the summer of love. It doesn't matter, before my time as well.
Hippies having it large with the wackybaccy and jiggy jig.

193 2018-08-15 23:35:12 The same SNAKE  OIL SALESMAN, that locked people out of his Church.  GoD told me Joel is going to HELL.  And Joel will BURN in HELL once he gets there!!!!!
194 2018-08-15 23:34:56 I think that the Digital social media and search engine business models are completely broken and rely on 'snake oil' practices for income.
195 2018-08-15 23:34:53 I read this: "The truth is there is no such thing as consistency. Consistency is a myth, and those peddling it are selling snake oil."

That's what I take issue with. I don't care about the article. Were you just saying that to "bait" people into reading the article?
196 2018-08-15 23:34:43 Refining? Glut of oil buying. Cheaper production.
197 2018-08-15 23:34:33 What oil did you buy?
198 2018-08-15 23:34:33 This oil must be from a rare species of snakes !

209 2018-08-15 23:33:37 Obama dropped 50 billion into green energy companies that took the money and ran. Model ts were privately funded by investors as most companies are. If subsidies were protected I wouldn't take issue with them.Blindly throwing money at "greener" ways promotes the same waste as oil

217 2018-08-15 23:32:40 Never trust an oil company that uses a Keurig.
218 2018-08-15 23:32:32 The only places I've read that have been on the oil and gas payroll. I really doubt it's accurate--it probably includes related fields.

A VAT?
231 2018-08-15 23:30:47 The only thing that make a mockery of propaganda is facts on the ground. We heard loopholes were blocked, loots were recovered in trillions, TSA garnered trillions and we also know oil revenue increased significantly 2yrs running now . Yet what’s the result totally failure.
232 2018-08-15 23:30:44 I think this nasty ass CBD oil is my new favorite thing.. if only it tasted good.

249 2018-08-15 23:29:05 And my dear country Nigeria.. Churning out almost N5trn a year from oil sales
250 2018-08-15 23:29:01 If CBD oil has no medicinal value, why is it a controlled substance?
251 2018-08-15 23:28:27 This is a lesson to all prospective candidates and voters alike to not mix business with government, especially US Democratic government. The two are like oil and water - they do not mix.
252 2018-08-15 23:28:18 Ask yourself why Norway will make £20bn in oil revenue this year producing the same amount of oil as the UK. Send me a link to how much would it cost Scotland to become independent.
253 2018-08-15 23:28:16 Well now I’ve read about a man falling into a vat of used cooking oil and grease and dying so I have a whole new horrible nightmare to envision, great, good, cool

256 2018-08-15 23:27:57 it's someone very upset with men , because they are probably, bitchy, grumpy, and a  no oil painting lunatic progressive leftist nutjob attention seeker
257 2018-08-15 23:27:45 Be sure to get the Decarboxylated CBD oil for pets. For some reason they respond really well to it.  That's what I give my 12y/o JRT for her pancreatitis.

263 2018-08-15 23:26:53 Its one thing to find dead dolphins or manatees from #RedTide, it says a lot when we’re finding dead Tarpons. Tarpons are one of the most heartiest fish in the sea. They have no problem with oil slicks or dirty brackish water, but they are being slaughtered by this years #RedTide

268 2018-08-15 23:26:11 When you injest the oil, it can help reduce stress that may cause the TMJ. A cream applied to the pain site can help relieve the symptoms. Always look for full spectrum CBD oil, and avoid multi-level-marketing businesses. Hope it will help you 
269 2018-08-15 23:26:08 My favorite essential oil is bacon grease. #gotanoilforthat

273 2018-08-15 23:25:36 #Qanon was easily unraveled as an alt-right scam, which is a typical aspect of their entire movement. It's predicated upon the Snake Oil Salesman lifestyle. 

Sell people a dream that plays to their delusions and biases strong enough, and they'll fork over anything for it.
274 2018-08-15 23:25:32 I never fail to hit my head WITH THE FUCKING OIL PUMPS AT WORK GDI
275 2018-08-15 23:25:27 Try the dill pickle Triscuits, or the rosemary and olive oil, you're remembering your childhood when only one flavor existed.
276 2018-08-15 23:25:27 Hell, his grandfather Prescot Bush laundered money for the Nazis, thats where he got the money to purchase Union Oil...
277 2018-08-15 23:25:06 LOL y’all i almost got caught up, so I went to go get an oil change for my car, so you know the mechanics always asking questions idk, so i called my dad, he pulled up then he got in my car to press a button  and says ”mhmm your car smells like cigar” i said aww hell na
278 2018-08-15 23:25:04 U mean who’s mutilating female genitalia
279 2018-08-15 23:25:02 Who says it wouldn’t be a car? It could be a super advanced car, able to have its own cars and bleed oil instead of an oil pan, tires for feet. You have no clue what life can evolve things into; You’re trying to though, because you know it’s super ignorant to think that way.

282 2018-08-15 23:24:33 That's funny most of the ppl I know who worked in oil and gas can't now because the price of oil was pushed down by OPEC. Also our water is infinitely more important. How many Coloradoans work in agriculture?
283 2018-08-15 23:24:18 Worst thing he could have done was apologise. He validated the madness and poured oil on the fire
284 2018-08-15 23:23:59 Drunkenly making an omelette early in the morning while wearing only a pair of shorts, I threw some sliced mushrooms into a pan of hot oil. The oil splashed onto my bare chest, causing me to drop my knife on my bare right foot. Chaos.
285 2018-08-15 23:23:58 Lol I'm kinda short and I got big tiddy. I was cleaning the flat top at work, and like you clean it by putting oil on it when it's hot and scrubbing it with a charcoal brick thing. There's a well where the oil gathers and as I was leaning to get the top, my chest soaked up oil
286 2018-08-15 23:23:49 Glad you've made it to @BMSupdates .   .
287 2018-08-15 23:23:49 You can buy oil from ISIS (allegedly), allow 80% of terrorists to enter Syria via Turkey, aid and take part in war-crimes, rapes, murder, looting, land stealing, torture, ethic cleansing, forced marriages, kidnapping, jailing people who vote against you. But NOT side with Iran.

289 2018-08-15 23:23:30 The Republicans started the subsidies late 1990s early 2000s. Both regimes supported it because US is going to lead this initiative while Trump “pretends” to be pro oil & coal. It’s a sly distraction along with pulling out of Paris Agreement.Model Ts & early cars needed subsidies
290 2018-08-15 23:23:25 There was a flammabity aspect.

Slid two goblins off a temple belltower, both died.

293 2018-08-15 23:23:01 I would try that first. You can get it on amazon it's cheap, then there is an oil you can get at Walmart call Calm Muscles. I use on my neck with an icey hot patch.

297 2018-08-15 23:22:02 A Section of Highway 351 was closed earlier due to lightning striking the oil tanks just before Zion. Lightning struck them causing oil to spew out everywhere. Everything is reopened at this time.
298 2018-08-15 23:21:40 That sounds painful! Maybe rub a little lavender oil in your ears?
299 2018-08-15 23:21:23 Don’t tell me how bad animal husbandry is while eating meat or how terrible big oil is while driving to the beach in your SUV or jumping on a plane to attend burning man. Go smoke some more pot and come up with real solutions.

301 2018-08-15 23:21:15 I tried for forty years to tame my curls. Then I finally grew my hair long and now they are glorious!
My secret: mildest shampoo/conditioner possible (I use Burt's Bees); pure argon oil afterward; air dry (I haven't used my blow dryer in 5 years); wash only 2x/week.

303 2018-08-15 23:21:04 Venezuela, incidentally, happens to have the single largest confirmed oil reserve of any nation on planet earth.
304 2018-08-15 23:20:41 How about the billions of gallons of oil pumped into the ocean a few years back....

314 2018-08-15 23:19:37 Bless him. He had the turning circle of an oil tanker and the reaction time of a cathedral. He was amusing to watch and tried hard but let’s be honest, he was an utterly useless football player. But, that’s up to £30K+ a week saved on wages.

317 2018-08-15 23:18:55 They also want to be safe and happy. But governments like yours are so brutal and they are always after someone else wealth (oil, gold, diamond...) They steal from them for the purpose of to become more powerful. They do not even share with their citizens :)
318 2018-08-15 23:18:51 My god! I can only imagine- I just burnt myself with hot oil this weekend.
319 2018-08-15 23:18:41 Why are you accepting money from the oil and gas industry? That is not how we are going to win.
320 2018-08-15 23:18:36 Woman to Woman (no offence Willy): You will definately want to ingest CBD oil for cramps. The topicals are wonderful too, but are more effective for sore muscles.  I remember when I had to go home from high school with cramps, it was horrible. Birth control helped A LOT.
321 2018-08-15 23:18:33 i was smoking with a friend and they we're reading something on their phone and asked me "what's CBD oil??" & i was like "it's cannabis oil" and theeeeennn they said "what's cannabis?" i almost cried skskkajsj

323 2018-08-15 23:18:29 Since the currency is based on oil in the ground, once you pump it all out, doesn't that mean your currency is gone? Or am I reading this wrong?

326 2018-08-15 23:18:12 The oil companies haven’t been caught selling babies organs on the black market and operate on abortion quotas ruining lives of mothers w post abortion depression while killing the baby! What a moronic comparison... really?

338 2018-08-15 23:16:49 1/3 So...here it is. I've begun experimenting with (THC-free) CBD oil for depression and anxiety and overall health. The side effects of prescriptions are annoying as hell, and I've read too much good literature (and heard very good things from very trusted people in my life)...

340 2018-08-15 23:16:37 @CNBC should do a program on the Mustang and what is has meant for @Ford success. The car survived the oil crises of the 70s and its own near cancellation. It's as much of an American icon as the Corvette and is now the best its ever been.
341 2018-08-15 23:16:35 Yeah i like to use coconut oil and aquaphor about once a week. Will def look into jojoba oil as well.

346 2018-08-15 23:15:56 But really not impossible when you look at historical data. It may be done inspite of him rather than by him especially if helped by high oil prices.
347 2018-08-15 23:15:49 I saw, I’m just saying if you’re working with certain materials such as oil it will stay for a day or two even after scrubbing your hands

351 2018-08-15 23:15:02 For example: Gun lobby says, vote our way, or we take $100,000 campaign contribution AWAY from you, and GIVE it to your opponent. They either do what lobby says, or lose their jobs. Same with Pharma, Oil, chemicals, airlines. What's good for them, aint nec. good for us.
352 2018-08-15 23:14:55 I use jojoba oil instead of pomade and it's helped to keep scalp hydrated. Havent had dandruff in years. But you won't be able to do any strong holds or anything like that.
353 2018-08-15 23:14:49 Good question but I'm betting he has or definitely intends to. Remember that Tillerson had been talking to the Russians about a really big oil deal that would make he and Putin very rich just before Trump brought him on board as Secretary of State.
354 2018-08-15 23:14:38 I'm a veterinarian and I once cut the shit out of my finger while doing a skin scrape to check for mange (the dog jumped).

I told her "Well, mineral oil, dog skin, possible mange mites..."

359 2018-08-15 23:14:12 I opted to spare my lungs and closed the apartment up tight. Now when I'm home carry around a spray bottle with water and tea tree oil and spritz myself when it gets stuffy. Nothing else to be done.
360 2018-08-15 23:14:09 Fake news! No where in the article does it say they are running out of oil or even close to it. This biggest problem is there is so much oil they don’t have enough pipeline!  click bait at its finest

365 2018-08-15 23:13:46 Gotta watch out for those vats of oil at Disney World.
366 2018-08-15 23:13:21 I jumped through all the “contact us” crap from BMW and spoke to a rep in NJ who said to wait for completion of N63 engine class action suit next month. BMW does nothing in the settlement. $75 oil change coupons and a $1000 coupon for a new BMW. Yeah, like I’m buying a new BMW
367 2018-08-15 23:13:19 Where is my oil?
It has been too long since we had dinner.
368 2018-08-15 23:13:16 We should seize the oil while we are at it. Amirite Andrew?

Love to try it when I get another damn job again.
372 2018-08-15 23:12:54 I was going to make a joke about the worker who died in Disney World falling into a cat of oil coming back as a masked super villain to haunt the place but I didn't because I'm a good person.
373 2018-08-15 23:12:54 And no one asked? Why does @Disney HAVE a VAT of OIL?

376 2018-08-15 23:12:47 I have a better idea.  Trump should invite big oil to drill anywhere they want at Mar-a-Lago.  Take one for the team, right Donald?  You're a patriot, right Donald?
377 2018-08-15 23:12:41 Same!  Tri colored w olive oil, lime juice, feta!!!!
378 2018-08-15 23:12:21 Cut them in half. Turn oven on to 400 or 450 at this point. Toss them in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Put cut side down in cast iron skillet.

385 2018-08-15 23:10:52 my coconut oil is reforming... fall is coming.
386 2018-08-15 23:10:48 its low on oil, take 2 quarts and put them in the engine, double check what oil to put in. do this ASAP, your engine can get royally fucked if you dont

388 2018-08-15 23:10:29 Then there is no excuse for you not to understand the technical hurdles that remain. You don't talk like a knowledgeable person; you talk like a zealot.

BTW, many countries are walking back their investment in green energy, notably Germany, which now imports oil from Russia.

407 2018-08-15 23:07:55 We need to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and shift our oil, coal, and natural gas resources to wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable energy sources such as water instead of using limited energy sources to make money through organizations that sell them.

429 2018-08-15 23:04:03 I am believing my own eyes! I’m seeing no increase in my paycheck, but, an increase in my electric, a massive increase in home oil, increase in gas, and increase on almost all products! @realDonaldTrump sucks! @BarackObama was so much better!

431 2018-08-15 23:02:12 In the CPO (crude palm oil) market, M'sia is a "price taker", not the "price fixer". It's not the dominant supplier, there are other sources, customers have multiple options. Bottom line: no guaranteed profits for CPO suppliers.

435 2018-08-15 23:01:56 When the federal government doesn’t apply carbon taxes to foreign oil but do to domestic oil while giving the four largest carbon emitters subsidies, it is hard to take their carbon issue seriously. The hundreds needing to jet off to Davos regularly for junkets makes it a farce.
436 2018-08-15 23:01:53 Last night I read you can put a drop of tea tree oil on a canker sore to help it heal, so I did. Then I read tea tree oil is poisonous when ingested so I stayed awake all night to make sure I didn’t die. How’s everyone else’s mental stability?
437 2018-08-15 23:01:30 A quick and easy one is to cook farro or rice or quinoa etc with a handful of red lentils w turmeric, garlic/ginger and salt, and saute shredded brussels sprouts w olive or sesame oil, garlic, crushed red pepper, and salt. Filling, nutritious, delicious!

442 2018-08-15 23:00:40 The more I read about what these scum did to those poor children, the angrier I get. It was evil. The fact they used Jesus, holy communion, and anointing with oil in their disgusting deeds makes it downright demonic. If you know me, you know I don’t use “evil” and “demonic” much.

469 2018-08-15 22:56:56 Not going to engage your oil rant b/c this isn't the tweet for it. BC is in crisis & as I recall Alberta had one similar a while back (I gather it didn't choke anyone).

489 2018-08-15 22:53:53 LOL. Twitter execs all got together and decided what this hellsite really needs is moar fighting. "Do you like clean water? Enjoy these tweets from Big Oil." "Do you think Black people are people? Well here's what the KKK has to say about that." Stellar work, guys. I can't wait!
490 2018-08-15 22:53:48 Jerry Brown was considered a pretty good governor but progressive people think he was too conservative when it came to issues like oil and gas wells.
491 2018-08-15 22:52:56 But I don’t believe in just “black & white”. Life is only shades of gray. We need oil and we need alternatives. We have gas & diesel cars & can use a hell of a lot more electric. Etc.....
492 2018-08-15 22:52:28 All-time favorite - kale salad with black beans, quinoa, farro, corn, radishes, carrots, celery and dressing of oil, meyer lemn juice, cumin, and salt. This is so very good and quite filling. I'll send my recipe if you want.

510 2018-08-15 22:49:16 The US dollar is the main artery of the global economy.The oil is its fuel, and when we rescue the first from the explosion we save one of our power tools.

521 2018-08-15 22:47:50 Random, but what if Hitler took control of the Russian oil fields like he had planned? Oil ended the war over there (or lack there of) because the Allied forces made sure of this and bombed anything that could carry oil    The weird shit I think of when riding back in the boat 
522 2018-08-15 22:47:42 Lava lamps made with vegetable oil, coloured water and then you add a fizzing tablet. It is simple but effective. Kids love it!

524 2018-08-15 22:47:36 Not much of a recipe. heat olive oil add w/e veggies U have (this was onions,garlic, bell pepper,zucchini, mushrooms). Then add some crushed tomatos from a box + chop a Roma tomato. Let simmer for 10mins, then add al dente pasta + lil pasta water. Stir up, serve w/ Parmesan
525 2018-08-15 22:47:34 And oil marketers

527 2018-08-15 22:47:09 Russia is a good leading indicator

530 2018-08-15 22:46:56 This might also ease some tensions in Iraq by throwing a bone to the Kurds elsewhere and not focusing on oil rich Iraqi Kurdistan.  Would imagine Iran is on board with this
531 2018-08-15 22:46:55 What's the matter John.....this shut down of your security clearance will significantly cut into your ability to continue dealing with gun/drug/oil and other natural resource trades that have made you wealthy???

533 2018-08-15 22:46:46 I just want to have a nice warm shower to stretch out my lower back but it’s really dangerous because despite the fact that our shower has poor drainage, my brother insists on jerking off with baby oil which creates a friction level akin to wearing wool socks on new hardwood
534 2018-08-15 22:46:19 Archimedes gets pretty oily and will leave smears on his blankets when he gets super dirty.  Gandalf actually just gets super DRY and her skin gets itchy and sensitive.

539 2018-08-15 22:45:42 It’s a cough syrup that definitely works. But I take that, oil of oregano and redoxen to keep myself from getting a cold / flu / cough / sore throat. It helps!
540 2018-08-15 22:45:37 Insalata Caprese: fresh tomato & mozzarella salad with fresh basil and a great olive oil is always a summer favorite. Artichokes are great, and grilled portabello mushrooms make a great hamburger substitute.

543 2018-08-15 22:45:22 For just one, roasting potatoes. (salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder).

And if duck fat is like goose fat, use a LOT less of it than you'd use of vegetable oil.
544 2018-08-15 22:45:19 It’s not like Venezuela was saving before Chavez. Perez engaged in a populist spending spree during the 70’s oil boom and had to deal with the same capital control induced crisis issues after the 86 Crash that Maduro is dealing with now.

567 2018-08-15 22:42:19 Yep! Every sphynx is completely different, so their bathing needs may vary, but on average you'll bathe them either every week or every month.  Gandalf has super sensitive skin so we've started using this special oil bath where I rub the oil off her skin and re-apply a good coat.
568 2018-08-15 22:42:04 The doctor did tell me to put two drops of olive oil in my ear every 2 weeks to prevent future blockages, maybe it'll help break down what's in your ears?
569 2018-08-15 22:41:59 Honesty compels me to say that I would oil wrestle with Ben...lol :-)
570 2018-08-15 22:41:59 Is it just a little demoralizing for Omarosa that a functional illiterate billionaire is President of the United States of America and she is a has-been hack trying to sell a snake oil book?
571 2018-08-15 22:41:57 kinder bueno, sunflower seeds, cheese, spanish jam, olive oil,...
572 2018-08-15 22:41:56 We have starving palm oil. We have been starving papers. We have been starving woods. Therefore we have been eroding Borneo.
573 2018-08-15 22:41:52 I support Standard Oil’s right to charge whatever they want for gasoline.
574 2018-08-15 22:41:37 I like that you said PH, not Rivers State. One factor why PH is arbitrarily expensive is the oil companies. The value of things in the hinterlands in Lagos cannot be compared to the main cities and commercial areas.
575 2018-08-15 22:41:36 Portobello mushrooms when sauted in olive oil and garlic tastes like meat. Just salt liberally
576 2018-08-15 22:41:23 Ladies, get peppermint castor oil and @frizzfreeCURLS scalp treatment so your scalp massages actually stimulate something. be more hands on with your hair. teamwork makes the dream work

580 2018-08-15 22:40:59 Cider Oil
Cider concentrated by boiling, to which honey is subse quently added. Also called cider royal, probably the original name; such being found in old receipt books, and is perhaps English, or may come from the supposed superior quality of the beverage.
581 2018-08-15 22:40:22 Yo @Ford not sure I’d call 2 hours plus for an oil change quick by any stretch, might wanna rename @QuickLane   (Don’t worry bout me though, I will never, ever be back)

583 2018-08-15 22:40:11 Everyone has TV money but Man city has that plus Arab oil money, which means higher wages $$$ . Guardiola as coach is just the cherry on top.

585 2018-08-15 22:40:05 ...Exit past stove is not only narrow, but a burn hazard wt hot pans full of boiling water or oil, and the handles hanging oer. Sometimes cook cannot move out of the way to make rm for wheelchairs. Nook is only 8 ft wide, wt a 3 ft passageway between two oppositely placed tables.
586 2018-08-15 22:40:02 I must read this oil meme going around
587 2018-08-15 22:40:00 If it does happen in spite of bright oil and gas picture of Texas, there are 2 possibilities. 1.Oil and gas picture of Texas is not bright 2. Global economic outlook is gloomy.
588 2018-08-15 22:39:59 Yes. Let's see what the country of Canada does when Alberta/Saskatchewan  collapses from Oil. Who will support the rest of  the Country? Quebec; BC? They would whether want the money than to support the country.
589 2018-08-15 22:39:54 Lowering our dependency on oil generally, will also lower our dependence on foreign oil.

For some reason this point is often overlooked.

595 2018-08-15 22:38:36 Was saying it yesterday and I really hope it happens but I'd love to see hockey take a page out of baseball's book and look to occasionally move multiple prospects to get actual players. That said, it would have to be done prior to them becoming suspect. Risky but...
596 2018-08-15 22:38:16 @ROWNTREES you use palm oil when there are alternatives. Shame on your company

607 2018-08-15 22:36:39 I invite you to wake up to the reality of a corrupt world order dominated by the US and ruled by GLOBAL oligarchs. This is our sad reality. There is no fairy tale world in which Venezuela's oil will not be stolen and the people made to suffer. Do you want it done by foreigners?
608 2018-08-15 22:36:27 And the snake oil salesmen are still mad at me. It’s adorable.
609 2018-08-15 22:36:15 Carve out the UST selling by oil exporters nations. They have been net sellers of Treasuries to fund budget deficits. Although they are net buyers this year oil above b/e.

1. Sleep w/ a satin or silk bonnet at night.
2. Instead of washing use an oil or your fav leave in to retwirl frizzy curls
3. Wear a shower cap when you shower but dont wash
4. Use natural product 
Hope that helps!

711 2018-08-15 22:22:11 What happened to the Russians?   What about the algae? Oil jumped to the top of your list? Trying to cover a lot of ground in the next few months. Subjects you need to bring up at the debates...If there are any.
712 2018-08-15 22:22:08 Everytime I come to the dealership to service my car they always try to hustle me  like damn just do my $30 oil change and stop trying to get me to spend $500 on services I don’t need

716 2018-08-15 22:21:29 Oh damn! I thought it was Elyria but that sucks. Oil changes take like a whole 10-20 minutes so it seems more logical just to do the truck first
717 2018-08-15 22:21:21 Corn is in everything. All the chips are fried in corn oil 
718 2018-08-15 22:21:09 I wish I had one of those biofuel cars so I could fill up ka fish oil 
719 2018-08-15 22:21:03 So I have some news. The recall didn't affect my pills after all, so that's a relief. Other news, my truck is leaking oil, so now I will see if my dad will fix it by day's end.
720 2018-08-15 22:20:57 Did you ever wonder how much better off Russia would be today....if there had been no invasion of Ukraine, no shoot down of MH-17, no collusion to throw the US election? Russian people should be benefiting from the vast oil reserves...but corruption ruins it, except for the few.
721 2018-08-15 22:20:54 Came home and made a fresh batch of salsa from the garden and then realized I'm out of tortilla chips. Corn tortillas, salt and coconut oil on hand to the rescue!
722 2018-08-15 22:20:54 I know there is hardship in Venezuela. I know part of it is due to the fall in the price of oil due to fracking technology creating a glut. But a big part of the problem is due to the US PURPOSEFULLY sabotaging Venezuela's government and economy. The US is not your friend!
723 2018-08-15 22:20:43 He needs to grow up. MAGA is just a campaign slogan. 

Pumping oil in the Dakota Access Pipeline is greater than hauling it by train. 

Our oil production is great again.
724 2018-08-15 22:20:26 It's the scene where he's playing with tanks in his office that makes the case...playing with toys and thinking he's some kind of badass who knows it all. But even Harold Ramis couldn't write a story line with an officer bragging about his beard oil. That was too far even for him
725 2018-08-15 22:20:19 Jess, sweetie: MN Man was wondering whether you even knew that the USSR had ended (I’m wondering that too). And Kameron rightly pointed out the hypocrisy of the Dems refusing, then accepting $ from big oil, which is killing our planet.

Okay, you can block me now too, Jessie.
726 2018-08-15 22:20:10 Sorry ehn
727 2018-08-15 22:19:57 People of #edfringe. I’m out of Thieve’s Oil. Where do I get more? TNX.
728 2018-08-15 22:19:46 oil consumption in volume terms is way down but the price impact has more than offset this (in the column)

732 2018-08-15 22:19:11 my jimmy choo signature eau de parfum and illicit eau de parfum are my signature scents. and i put tea tree oil in my shampoo and use buku argan + jojoba oil in my hair afterwards. i doooooonttt understand why people choose to smell musty.
733 2018-08-15 22:19:11 Will bear in mind as I approach 1,000 miles. Mechanic told me cars have magnetic oil pans to catch fine metal particles present in the oil.

735 2018-08-15 22:18:32 Who doesn’t already know about Iran sanctions going into effect... but I agree, we shall see. As I said, there may be other reasons for oil to rally, but thanks for pointing out that there are other factors at work (which is different how?)
736 2018-08-15 22:18:28 Turkey could do what India did in 2013--impose some restrictions on gold imports. Also, they could ration oil domestically. But that still will likely not be enough IMO.
737 2018-08-15 22:18:27 Why that was dug up by me very own oil crew in the Yukon! HAH! These question's are child's play!!!
738 2018-08-15 22:18:24 was researching on renewable energies and oil drilling earlier today. both billion dollars industries. expect one brings hope and the other doesn’t.
739 2018-08-15 22:18:19 So to paraphrase again, dead babies =$$$....for both women and PP (dead baby parts are the new oil)?

742 2018-08-15 22:18:01 My face is full of coconut oil.. now I want bounty chocolate.
743 2018-08-15 22:17:39 I told someone the same thing, and it resorted to him asking what my discipline was ND where I got my qualifications. If we remove Dangote from the pictures we are only left with Oil, Telecom ND banking, this is a frontier market..
744 2018-08-15 22:17:36 Lmao just two things. Fry it in butter and coconut oil. And finish off with some coarse salt
745 2018-08-15 22:17:31 When it comes to energy, AK has more to offer than only oil and gas! And the innovative nature of Alaskans will without a doubt eventually see this come to fruition. Keep pushing @lisamurkowski
746 2018-08-15 22:17:27 Are you referring to the same oil consultant Page with ties to Russia? I don't care if Strzok raises his fund amount daily. That's his business--just like his texts to his girlfriend are none of my business.

754 2018-08-15 22:16:52 @BRICBreaker Hey Ken China is playing the long game towards becoming self sufficient. You didn't mention China was stepping up it's own soy productions and looking for alternatives to soy. Iran is selling oil to China for a song! Think Ken! Think!

757 2018-08-15 22:16:12 Of course not. If they told you, you might not take it. 

If you ever need to know who’s running the country, just take a look at every street corner. Drug stores and gas stations => pharmaceutical companies and oil barons.
758 2018-08-15 22:16:09 Also the city that stopped our pipeline, because Saudi Oil is soooo much more ethical.
759 2018-08-15 22:16:07 Good man! Keep the snake oil salesman on his toes
760 2018-08-15 22:16:04 He's 100% right Doug. You ravaged a country on false pretenses to get your hands on oil. Countless civilians murdered. Nothing to be proud of

782 2018-08-15 22:13:40 I'll need you to answer these questions:
-Was it PMB that depleted our foreign reserves?
-Was it PMB that made our economy to be oil dependent?
-Was it PMB dat prevented Nigeria from saving during the oil boom?
-Was it PMB dat caused the oil prices to slump?
783 2018-08-15 22:13:38 Highly unlikely that Russian Economy will grow that much (now it’s 1.3Tr). By 2050 the population will diminish by 30mln and export of Oil will not grow that much anymore.

787 2018-08-15 22:13:19 How I pay 92 dollars for a oil change
788 2018-08-15 22:13:16 100% of our food products contain only certified sustainable palm oil, in accordance with the guidelines laid out by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). That means every single food and beverage product in our stores containing palm oil adheres to 1/2

801 2018-08-15 22:11:31 Iunno but we ain’t doing it lol, we’ll just keep topping off the oil every so often and have to buy a new car when we can. Just hoping it doesn’t shit the bed in that time

808 2018-08-15 22:10:41 I was interested in finding out about 7OH-mitragynine to find out if it was the primary source of the pain mediating effects of kratom. I bought a standardized tincture in which the 7OH derivative was extracted into the oil. Trying it produced little more than the plant.

851 2018-08-15 22:04:52 You still use oil in them, saves oil/money, worth it.
852 2018-08-15 22:04:50 The older I get the more I actually believe that a handful of leaves w a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar is a good and filling meal, so I guess that's where I am in life
853 2018-08-15 22:04:49 New technology will take decades I think before it it viable for power producing.
Also, oil and gas is so vitaly important because of all the things made from them. We don't have the technology yet to reproduce the majority of items that oil and gas supplies.
854 2018-08-15 22:04:43 Benefits of Going Green! 
Oil or natural gas prices are always on the rise, and as
usage continues to skyrocket, the demand for these
resources will drive prices up. Solar energy is an
economically wise purchase.

871 2018-08-15 22:01:59 It’s not about skin type it’s just about the chemical structure of the oil I guess? Like it inherently has the ability to clog pores. That being said some ppl don’t experience breakouts bc of it and it is really hydrating in general
872 2018-08-15 22:01:54 Preferably baby oil but any should do

887 2018-08-15 22:00:11 Smh my dad drives my car more than I do. Granted he puts gas in it when he takes it and sometimes leaves me with more gas than I had. But I’m bouta make him pay for the next oil change if he keeps taking it 
888 2018-08-15 22:00:01 WHAT ARE THEY DOING OVER THERE? I know they have butter, I’ve seen it in fridges. Are they using it to oil their bikes? Treat baseball bays? Why won’t they spread it on food?

903 2018-08-15 21:58:25 Could you see the possibility of a compromise? Would you oppose the twinning of the pipeline to ship refined oil to the Lower Mainland, thus keeping bitumen out of the waters? This of course presupposes the construction of a refinery somewhere along the route.

939 2018-08-15 21:53:19 Ok. Not the type of long term investment philosophy we pursue so you be right. Btw, Iran sanctions more than fully baked into price, if oil rallies it won’t be for that reason

947 2018-08-15 21:52:04 I thin the first question should be; based on the current price of Alberta Bitumen, is there a viable market for exported oil? If not, suspend the project and divert the proposed budget to other energy industry projects in Alberta and BC.

992 2018-08-15 21:48:42 Mineral oil smothers them, used it on our dogs at camp alot. Topical of course.
993 2018-08-15 21:48:36 Biko Monkey Post is the right one. Na we invented oh ni. Forgot Oyibo that how they will carry out oil in nija and go and refine abroad and bring it back again. It is Monkey post !
994 2018-08-15 21:48:35 Oh no those poor oil companies will br unable to ruin the planet.
995 2018-08-15 21:48:07 as per u, Rupee is at the mercy of Oil rate. Nothing else matter. Then what explains oil export countries loosing their currency against $.
2004 NDA left healthy economy growing at 8.5% rate with surplus money in hand. How did that dropped to 4.5% with fiscal deficit?

997 2018-08-15 21:48:03 Trump & the US oil industry don't want a pro-Palestinian rights socialist elected in the UK.  So they'll be instructing the Israeli govt to up the anti-Semitism smears. There'll be loads more lies & smears on a whole range of issues.
998 2018-08-15 21:47:58 Raw brocolli and cauliflower w carrots red onions and some kale. Salt vinegar olive oil and honey. Thank me later
999 2018-08-15 21:47:44 Never before have my tatts itched after healing. Oil n thick lotion helps in no way only this  I’m grateful moisturized goddess issa flick.
1000 2018-08-15 21:47:36 Traitors, traitors, traitors why don't you publish what you signed? Why are all the oil contracts secret? Why are all your negotiations secret traitor? Selling Iran to save your corrupt brutal regime?
1001 2018-08-15 21:47:31 “Businessmen” (in quotes to distinguish successful idea men from the snake oil ilk) ruin most things, as we’ve seen every. damn. day.
1002 2018-08-15 21:47:10 Last oil change I got was in the winter and these mf’s not only changed my oil pan bolt from 14 mm to 13 mm without telling me, but they torqued it down and stripped the new one they put on... so now this bitch is impossible to get off
1003 2018-08-15 21:47:08 "Tonight on I  the 2010s, we look back when that gloomy decade went crazy for crypto, that snake oil fiat that climbed and cratered like a North Korean rocket..."
1004 2018-08-15 21:46:55 I think it will make it recognizable, whether you sell your olive oil in Canada or America or in Urugay.....especially our vatreni made i very recognizable this year....I think it is a good time for you guys to start now.
Also imagewise.
1005 2018-08-15 21:46:46 Good! I already use CBD oil for anxiety and occasionally insomnia so I'm used to the feeling. The place I went - "The End Cafe" has all sorts of super ridiculous drinks (think "unicorn lattes") - but I didn't have enough time to stop and try something weird. Next time, though!

1007 2018-08-15 21:46:36 /2 or whether the oil filler has an inbuilt dip-stick to measure level. Both cases will require knowledge of what the indicated level means, in terms of action needed. Honda dealer will know right oil to use, too. Red light is a last resort thing. If it lights, you must stop.
1008 2018-08-15 21:46:35 They even have twin oil leaks from the sump and front diff........ What a pair
1009 2018-08-15 21:46:30 There are plenty of alternatives, but palm oil is really cheap, so big companies can make even bigger profits by using it!  #OrangutanJungleSchool
1010 2018-08-15 21:46:19 If you are a day trader you shouldn’t care one way or the other about DUCs. I agree it is going to 60 (or lower) but you can’t argue the oil price hasn’t rallied in the last year
1011 2018-08-15 21:46:08 Him go fail like ororo wey dem put inside engine in place of engine oil
1012 2018-08-15 21:46:07 A very fair point, but even a dxy of 0.5% = 500kbbl/d which is significant in the context of the oil market, particularly if that drop becomes cumulative over a couple of years of weak demand. But I take your point!
1013 2018-08-15 21:46:02 Exactly that with the 2 oven converted from solid fuel to oil! 4 oven was oil. The days of taking the embers out of the aga with a shovel ...
1014 2018-08-15 21:46:02 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
1015 2018-08-15 21:46:00 Crude oil was never a curse to Nigeria, other countries have crude oil and everybody lives a good life. Nigeria's case is complicated by tribalism which fuelled corruption supported by religion. Few nations can survives these 3 entities. @Gidi_Traffic @MBuhari
1016 2018-08-15 21:45:58 Wake up to what is going on. The US wants disruption, revolt and suffering so it can move in and rob your country of its oil and anything else it can exploit. Saying you don't care about the US government is naive and ignores the reality of this corrupt world order.
1017 2018-08-15 21:45:53 Which part was great? When we enslaved Africans to work southern fields? Or when we murdered and relocated all the natives? Or treated black ppl horribly after coming back from WWI/WWII? Or when we sent millions to die for nothing to get more oil?
1018 2018-08-15 21:45:51 Oil changes will forever blow my mind
1019 2018-08-15 21:45:48 I don't disagree with you.
1020 2018-08-15 21:45:36 Ahhhhh of course you have money from the oil therefore you need to buy it to protect your leaders against your own people. What is the point to manufacture them, if your army force doesn’t know how  to use them?
1021 2018-08-15 21:45:20 Snake Oil salesmen rarely do...
1022 2018-08-15 21:45:12 Himself finally couldn’t get out of going to Tufts Cove. So they are literally washing oil off rocks, one by one, down there. 

That’s what bunker oil leaks do.
1023 2018-08-15 21:45:11 The only guy in that bunch that ever projected beyond a 6-7 NHL/AHL Tweener was Marincin (I never saw it, others did). And we saw how he turned out.  Substantial difference between then and now.

1034 2018-08-15 21:43:54 oil is better
1035 2018-08-15 21:43:50 Best thing to do would be to find a Honda bike dealers and tell them what you’ve been up to recently, then ask if someone could just have a very quick look at the oil level for you. How it’s done will depend on whether there is an oil level inspection window in the engine /1
1036 2018-08-15 21:43:45 You mean you and Matt in the Camper Van with the Olive Oil? 

#DirtyCleudo
1037 2018-08-15 21:43:23 What you have to expect is the Oil under 30$, With trade war and iran sanction and turkey problem turkey and china could buy ALL iranian oil with [30$-35$] to have less expensive production. Which means a best competitive prices leading to more exports.
1038 2018-08-15 21:43:11 Warren wouldn't touch Tesla with a 10 foot pole. He invests in mature businesses that generate CFs and pay a handsome dividend. Goldman Sachs on the other hand has put Tesla on a restricted list. Saudi is everything you Tesla dreamers stand against (big oil & centralized control)
1039 2018-08-15 21:43:08 can confirm, this happened to my sister so i’m always on time with my oil changes now
1040 2018-08-15 21:42:52 coconut oil? on ya face??
1041 2018-08-15 21:42:51 The US will rob the future Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Iraq and Syria treasury, confiscate its oil, kill the men, occupy the land, steal historical monuments. A country that carries no human value...
1042 2018-08-15 21:42:47 You are not in oil country
1043 2018-08-15 21:42:35 Today I heard a driller tell a hand use some muscle dammit don’t be a pussy all your life and the hands response was yes sir. And that right there is why I Iike working in the oil field. Take your lick and keep on working.
1044 2018-08-15 21:42:24 very beautiful oil painting portrait gives peace of mind as you look inside.
1045 2018-08-15 21:42:19 Chia made a mistake not addressing Sekera’s injury last year and gambled on too many players having a similar season to 16/17; he can’t afford to gamble this year
1046 2018-08-15 21:42:17 I would, but at the moment I'm wondering why that mans' arm is in tha man's pants. Is that an oil wrestling technique?
1047 2018-08-15 21:42:17 Why would a mixture of eggs and olive oil cause clogged arteries?

1051 2018-08-15 21:41:51 Oil is up 45% in last year. That is a price rally in anyone’s books (unless you are a day trader)

1057 2018-08-15 21:41:26 Epidiolex is the first “CBD” medication for epilepsy, and it costs $33,000 a year..... the cbd oil with the same percent reduction in seizures is only roughly $600 a month, just without the Fda approval. Big pharma is a joke.
1058 2018-08-15 21:41:21 You tried using Vaseline or anything oil based ?
1059 2018-08-15 21:41:21 The related difference, as I see it, is that the D-prospects that are pushing now promise to be NHL players for a while.  In the past, if we were lucky, those were 6-7 guys.  If we were lucky.
1060 2018-08-15 21:41:17 They should be labeled " Snake Oil" professors,  that is a more accurate title!
1061 2018-08-15 21:41:11 When I go to get an oil change why can't it just be that.. I don't care if you think I need a new filter and I know my car makes a funny noise but I'm poor and that's not what I'm here for

1074 2018-08-15 21:39:51 It went to under $30 a barrel in Jan 2016. Saudi need oil at $85 to balance their books! Good luck - as the Venezuelan oil minister said "oil is God's excrement" - Saudi male unemployment rate and laziness is a major concern.
1075 2018-08-15 21:39:50 Am I the only one who turns off and on their car when the engine/oil light come on hoping it would go away?
1076 2018-08-15 21:39:50 In the case of BP, the government had capped the liability exposure for oil spills, so that a company faced no difference in cost for a big spill or for one 100x as large. Therefore, there was no incentive to avoid the extra risk.
1077 2018-08-15 21:39:49 Don't worry too much about it

1087 2018-08-15 21:38:56 Liken it to oil.  Lots of companies were going out of business when it dropped to $30 a barrel.  We need the price of pot to begin to trend up again for long term success.  That will certainly change the margins a bit.

1090 2018-08-15 21:38:44 I don't understand why palm oil is in everything??? Is there nothing ethically suitable as an alternative?? #OrangutanJungleSchool #channel4
1091 2018-08-15 21:38:44 Psh. Boil some pasta or rice, sauté a simple sauce (olive oil and some spices does the trick), toss ‘em together. Add veggies on the side, or sauté some mushrooms or meat before the sauce. Easy peasy; the most you have to remember is to take some veggies/meat out of the freezer.
1092 2018-08-15 21:38:30 No bcos oil light. But I’ll get it checked tomorrow. Silly girl q. Where do I go to do that or can I do it if I YouTube it?
1093 2018-08-15 21:38:23 That’s why we never mix like water with the oil
1094 2018-08-15 21:38:13 I can already hear the faint whispered conversation of games and beard oil
1095 2018-08-15 21:38:10 Stock build this week had a lot to do with imports--1.1 mmb/d & 7.6 mmb/wk more than last week. Maybe I'm assuming too much saying that the imports are heavier but USA sure doesn't need more light oil from somewhere else when we're over-producing our own.

1109 2018-08-15 21:36:35 Is your suspension actually user-adjustable? If it isn’t, slightly higher tyre pressure on the back is right thing to do. No need to up the front presdure though. And have you had your oil checked?
1110 2018-08-15 21:36:25 Could you make your feet slight and delicate
Your breasts firmer
Ears shorter
Belly flatter
Does your skin need oil

Can you change the colour of your eyes
Teach your voice emphasis

Could you take out your mind & put in mine

Could you be me

Would you

La lengua de las/os navarras/os "no se usa mucho", pero la de castilla y frances d'Oil si, raro no?
Casi nadie habla del lliones, asturianu, romances navarro y aragones, catalan de la Franja en Aragon, ni del aranes
1130 2018-08-15 21:34:46 You know you need to go the gym when you put oil on the button of your jeans so that they'll fasten xoxo
1131 2018-08-15 21:34:29 Sprinkle some oil, red pepper, and Parmesan and you’ve got yourself a cold masterpiece
1132 2018-08-15 21:34:27 You think all the oil money Nigeria made was spent by the FG? Ignorance is bad! Of Nigeria's earnings, the FG takes 52%, while the states & local governments take 48%! Okay?
#LazyNigerianYouth. Wake up & stop.bottomfeeding off of #APC's thrash!
1133 2018-08-15 21:34:22 Coconut oil bakin
1134 2018-08-15 21:34:19 Try oregano oil (the version for internal use). It's great for the immune system. Should be available in health food stores.
1135 2018-08-15 21:34:16 And with sweet oil
costly
you anointed yourself

and on a soft bed
delicate
you would let loose your longing
1136 2018-08-15 21:34:10 It is great if you are a bit space limited. I had an ancient 2 oven in that space but it was converted solid fuel to oil and never really got to temp. Sold it and got this.
1137 2018-08-15 21:34:04 That’s good that they can do that now, but with Obamacare there was no shopping. And not micro this is facts . Us steele is up from 140.00 a ton to 360-450 a ton. That’s a huge deal. People think about oil but it’s the Steele that really keep your country moving.
1138 2018-08-15 21:34:01 Lol oh come on now that poor guy I don't know if he could take it again :D
1139 2018-08-15 21:33:50 Orangs are amazing creature's, so intelligent. Stop the palm oil business that's destroying their homes and our planet.
1140 2018-08-15 21:33:48 Lots of First Nations people work in the oil and gas sector to!
1141 2018-08-15 21:33:45 Real mayo is fine. Eggs and olive oil are two of the healthiest things you can eat.
1142 2018-08-15 21:33:42 Mine are like that two. I even get them in my ears. They love me. I put Cotten in when out and about so that can’t get to deep. I hope it works as well for you as for me. If you have some tea tree oil that will help reduce any bacteria from scratching.
1143 2018-08-15 21:33:40 Yesterday my #Twitter posts criticizing @realDonaldTrump apparently offended many. So I ask YOU #AnimalKingdom #wildlife #AnimalRights #climatechange #environment #offshore #Oil #drilling protesters why don't you speak up? 40 ppl unfollowed me and I thank them!
1144 2018-08-15 21:33:39 You are a clown!! As you use oil and gas everyday and bitch about the price!!!! Only for votes, I guess the economy will tell, when we’re not all driving electric cars and having solar panels next year???
1145 2018-08-15 21:33:34 My coworker found spilled peanut oil today and rushed to clean it up and told me to stay clear because of my allergy and honestly the best 
1146 2018-08-15 21:33:24 He would also understand the importance of the middle East for it's oil reserves as would Eisenhower.
1147 2018-08-15 21:33:20 If you have to go microwave, go with Homestyle.

Besides that, kernels, olive oil. Salt. Butter
1148 2018-08-15 21:33:03 Who sends a choir to a warfront if they aren't insane? Who borrows empty barrels to pour out a pot of oil if they are not due for psychiatric evaluation? Who breaks enemy wall by shouting at it if their brain is not touching?

You choose the foolish things to confound the wise.
1149 2018-08-15 21:32:56 That oil is still pretty pliable after 349+ years. LOL!
1150 2018-08-15 21:32:47 The pressure of the assignment on your life will cause the oil of the anointing to flow. Embrace the process. #JCM Judith Christie McAllister
1151 2018-08-15 21:32:42 Braylyn paid for my oil change.... #realfriends
1152 2018-08-15 21:32:30 Sad that those factory workers were swindled by a conman, just because of the precariousness of their factory work stability, and voting for snake oil salesman who promised them a job security that will never be possible under his administration, FFS just look at his life record.
1153 2018-08-15 21:32:18 But let’s blame the last government for all the missteps of the LPC? Ok then. Does Pal Justy have shares in Iriving Oil, Saudi Aramco in his so called Blind Trust? Do you?
1154 2018-08-15 21:32:03 Mommy gives me Greenies for hairballs and sometimes some olive oil. She brushes me a lot too. But every once in a while I get a hairball. But I’m fine now. The rug ... not so much. MOL!
1155 2018-08-15 21:32:00 Just read about spiders being fucking massive this year & I'd be lying if I said I hadn't just spent the last half hr spraying my room with lavender oil. Smells like a hippy den up in here.
1156 2018-08-15 21:31:50 If I may ask are we now drinking anointing oil
1157 2018-08-15 21:31:30 See "Neet's foot oil"
1158 2018-08-15 21:31:26 i miss the oil field money 
1159 2018-08-15 21:31:18 Hahaha that 18yr old is gonna really push us over the top.... right...
1160 2018-08-15 21:31:04 Baking powder in a paste left on for a bit then scrubbed off gets rid of blackheads an shrinks ur pores and salicylic acid and rose hip oil every night clears ur skin suuuuper fast 
1161 2018-08-15 21:31:00 The oil, second in, is the cover of a good biography, looks least mad of any I know.
1162 2018-08-15 21:30:58 There is 400 barrels of oil in 20,000 barrels of produced water. At $50 per barrel, that's $20,000 per day lost forever. The system that makes this happen can be paid for in 3 months. What are you waiting for? Ask for proof.
1163 2018-08-15 21:30:55 Why are we subsidizing tobacco farmers and oil companies? Because of lobbyists. Legalized bribery. The corruption of the two party system.
1164 2018-08-15 21:30:46 The cleansing, healing oil of the Holy Spirit is applied to our hearts when we are hurt or wounded.
1165 2018-08-15 21:30:38 Don't know depends what happens with Iran.

You could see an oil shock.

Though I would bet that China's efforts to pump the economy will fail, the EZ is in pain and that's before the Italian budget and QE taper and USA is probably over the peak.

Slowdown could do weird things.
1166 2018-08-15 21:30:33 You so get me . . . I mean, not literally, because the baby oil.  I'm committed to the process.
1167 2018-08-15 21:30:31 It's definitely not a bad idea to see if the time on the meds will have had a permanent effect. A neurologist would be able to answer the question of does this ever occur. Another consideration could be using CBD oil without TCP - if it's available and legal in Ca. Good luck.

1176 2018-08-15 21:29:41 "World's greatest," yelled the snake oil salesman while selling subpar shit that was also very likely carcinogenic.
1177 2018-08-15 21:29:34 A dream I have is to get really good at realism and drawing realistically so that I can create a oil painting of Jesus doing a kick flip...
1178 2018-08-15 21:29:09 I like tofu now that I have learned how to cook it! Raw tofu is horrible. If its marinated and sautéed in some oil, it’s quite good w noodles!
1179 2018-08-15 21:29:03 Olive oil and oregano on hoagies. Saltpepperketchup on cheesesteaks.
1180 2018-08-15 21:28:55 I never made that connection. On the other hand, if Tillerson still held stock when he was Secretary of State, that would constitute a conflict of interest. Again, his government decision could personally enrich him from foreign government-owned oil companies.

1182 2018-08-15 21:28:36 i dropped my oil cartridge and ingested all that i could scavenge.. now i’m freezing in 90° weather. this isn’t a cry for help.
1183 2018-08-15 21:28:27 Use the blue lush soap bar boo seriously it will STRIP every oil
1184 2018-08-15 21:28:22 I understand you. At some point or another I have been “accused” of working for each one of the major oil companies. And, brace for it, the nuclear industry. Those misers! 
1185 2018-08-15 21:28:14 Will you say the same about oil and gas industry? I’ll bet not.
1186 2018-08-15 21:28:11 Sir actually most of Chinese projects especially in Kashmir ř sub-standard. Just to name 1 that u as well ř referring :-
Unit-1of 242.25 MW has started leaking oil & mgmt halted its op on May 31. Unit-4 is already closed as armature of rotor caught fire in 3 x days of commission.
1187 2018-08-15 21:28:09 I think so!!! It’s good for you and it’s organic...why do u think I’m following every cannibis oil dealer on here??? 
1188 2018-08-15 21:28:08 Seems like such an easy political win for Trudeau at this point “hey so we are going to tax oil imports to bring them in line with our domestic carbon tax scheme and we will start tomorrow with Saudi Arabia” 

New Brunswicks owner the Irving fam might delcare independence though.
1189 2018-08-15 21:28:02 You’re missing my point. BP took greater risks that led to the most massive oil spill ever because they knew that their liability was capped. If it had not been capped, they wouldn’t have taken that risk, and the spill would’ve been avoided.
1190 2018-08-15 21:27:58 Philosophy of business and how Zapata Oil Driving Services got to the oil fields first and yet it was always can "the out of towners" stop feeding "the bit guy" and yet Jenna stood there in the womb waiting in line and hoping the other eggs wouldn't roll down the hill first.
1191 2018-08-15 21:27:44 I love putting castor oil in my hair especially since I’m bald
1192 2018-08-15 21:27:44 Tumse sikha Btw put oil in the fire chalu Ho gaya srk fans ka as usual 
1193 2018-08-15 21:27:43 Why stretching this? You were gob smacked when Model town happened. Now he went to say sorry and his party send him show cause notice then why are you guys pouring oil in this fire. Shame on you. This man is also increase his price. Has anyone else ever went any where for sorry
1194 2018-08-15 21:27:42 Oil falls sharply, ends at 10-week low after unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories
1195 2018-08-15 21:27:36 Meanwhile Norwsy still making loads out of oil. How can that be?
1196 2018-08-15 21:27:35 I got my oil changed today and the guy said “your car is leaking a lot, make sure you tell your parents sweetie”...... so the story of people thinking I’m 16 continues

1198 2018-08-15 21:27:03 Should europeans stop complaining about migrants that they created by destroying libya, to steal its gold and oil ?
1199 2018-08-15 21:26:54 I’ll just be here observing Real Madrid without Ororo (oil) 
1200 2018-08-15 21:26:44 And it may be cheesy......but coupons for favors.  She's going to need the help.  If you can afford the time, offer to perform a task for her.  Groceries, oil change, walk the dog.  Little daily things that may giver her respite.
1201 2018-08-15 21:26:40 Ok. Why are we subsidizing the oil companies?
1202 2018-08-15 21:26:39 @nprfreshair Please stop accepting Exxon's money and their green-washing ads! Exxon has been undercutting efforts to #ActOnClimate for decades. My beach was coated by their oil and now my neighborhood burned in a climate-induced heat event. #RenewableEnergy please!
1203 2018-08-15 21:26:38 roommate is going to absolutely freak when he sees the lifesized oil painting i have of myself
1204 2018-08-15 21:26:20 Prescott had to get a full lather before reporting to the boys that oil is a for profit venture yet she was always worried that non profits would take over the orphan "drug" issues and make nurse practitioners his wife in the end.  Yet politics makes strange bed fellows ask the

1206 2018-08-15 21:26:13 Probably, but that oil and gas money was definitely the seed finance for the rest of the investments. Oil and gas goods and related services still accounts (unfortunately) for more than half, perhaps somewhere closer to 60 % of Norwegian economy
1207 2018-08-15 21:26:00 Unlike many #CBD vape companies, #BIOLIEF doesnt contain any harmful chemicals in our vape #oil. Our sungrown #hemp, combined with pure #coldpressed extraction make our CBD #vape oils one of the best and safest in the market!
1208 2018-08-15 21:26:00 Why is it that when U.S. was deciding on intervening in Syria and propogandizing the use of chemical weapons, MSM on a non-stop crusade.

Where is the concern for Yemen? Where is the coverage? Becuz we are aiding in Yemen & Syria is oil.

1209 2018-08-15 21:25:58 That's literally how Ghanaians Fry their plantains, overripe and soaked in oil... It's annoying.
1210 2018-08-15 21:25:47 All looks interesting! Coconut oil is defo good stuff!! 
1211 2018-08-15 21:25:44 Infowars is certainly not a news site but simply an outlet for a deranged fat man selling snake oil products to the very gullible.

1215 2018-08-15 21:25:14 the guy at the oil change place just asked me what kind of oil my car takes and ive never been asked that before so i had to lie and say ive never had this done myself so he wouldn't think im stupid
1216 2018-08-15 21:25:04 #MATD  Drilling for 650m barrels in next 3 months.
Oil in the ground mininum value is 3$/£2.36  a barrel and we targetting 850m barrels in total.

Let that sink in we are drilling for 2 BILLION  POUNDS  worth of oil and our mkt cap is £ 52.3m

Current share price 7.9p
1217 2018-08-15 21:24:57 It’s just eggs yolks emulsified in oil, with different additions (eg lemon juice) for flavor. Back then the kitchen tools to do this weren’t available like today. Betting many recipes include it just don’t use off the shelf but instead use the ingredients and process.
1218 2018-08-15 21:24:40 Exactly. ;)
1219 2018-08-15 21:24:40 Basically swishing oil in your mouth to pull toxins from the body, it’s a whole thing lol
1220 2018-08-15 21:24:39 Mmmmmmmm. Something only #bpal fans will appreciate. I just found an old (like 5+ year) Snake Oil Chaos Theory hiding in my closet. And my god it smells amazing in the bottle. Talk about aging well!
1221 2018-08-15 21:24:30 I’m terrible for this. But I cook from the heart, a glug of oil is my fave. I know what a glug is, many people might not. Alas.
1222 2018-08-15 21:24:30 Oiil Drilling Services is not the problem but the sheer volumes of "stench" and the oil dripping over precious Jenna's headball was too much for the "gang" to bear.
1223 2018-08-15 21:24:27 just wait until its selling oil in a new scots pound...
1224 2018-08-15 21:24:24 The way I see it, Caramel Apple Cake is egg, flour, butter, coconut oil, sugar, apples, cinnamon, and a little nutmeg.

Which is Protein, Ground Grain, Dairy, Nut Oil, Cane Sugar, Fruit, and Tree Bark.

...I am good with that.

1227 2018-08-15 21:23:58 remember the studs we used to have like Musil, Marincin, Gernat, Simpson, Laleggia
1228 2018-08-15 21:23:54 Pick out 5-10 of plant based foods you do like and gradually add more of them into your diet, drink more water, cut down on oil, salt, and sugar, eventually youll work out a healthier and more enjoyable menu

1231 2018-08-15 21:23:36 Y‘aaaallllllll. I used a coffee body scrub, a coconut lotion and topped this with some rose body oil. I smell soooo beyond good right now like I don’t know what to do 
1232 2018-08-15 21:23:19 I use dry shampoo in between washes. I feel like the trick it to spray it,let it sit for a couple mins and then lightly brush extra out.But tbh your scalp may be dry from over washing which can make it produce extra oil to hydrate.Maybe a once a week deep conditioner would help?
1233 2018-08-15 21:23:06 Peter, finally some thoughts on Oil from you. It’s been a long time. Thank you vm!
1234 2018-08-15 21:22:59 @DHPIV @AGoldFan no mention of olive oil #mayo? Was converted by my mom when she went on weight watchers

1237 2018-08-15 21:22:29 Finally getting my oil changed
1238 2018-08-15 21:22:27 Deepening worries about global economic growth, particularly in China, set off a rout in riskier assets including technology stocks, copper and crude oil. U.S. retailers took a drubbing after Macy's reported weaker sales.
1239 2018-08-15 21:22:17 Appreciated the phone call outreach from @nspowerinc today, good to know that there’s an effort being made to communicate directly with even small stakeholders while this oil spill gets cleaned up.
1240 2018-08-15 21:22:13 And why in heaven's name is the Midwest's and north's reaction to that despairing fact to buy the snake oil from the guy with grotesque appeal????
1241 2018-08-15 21:21:56 That's where we are going with the dollar. 

I m trying to think what next?

As EMs are going to be hit by currencies devaluation & inflation, I see lower demand ahead for oil. That market needs to break. It can be a big problem for the US shale producers if it goes below $40/BOE

1247 2018-08-15 21:21:04 Salad cream is a creamy, pale yellow condiment based on an emulsion of about 25–50 percent oil in water, emulsified by egg yolk and acidulated by spirit vinegar. It may include other ingredients such as sugar, mustard, salt, thickener, spices, flavouring and colouring.
1248 2018-08-15 21:21:02 This is very true. I've also suggested a few tilting cauldrons, for pouring boiling oil or pitch. (Or half-burnt coffee.)
1249 2018-08-15 21:20:58 No advice for the cough, but immune system is very sensitive to diet and stress. Two ancient immune booster: cod liver oil and epsom salts.

Epsom for Mg. Don't eat it, soak in it. No bath? Just feet and hands works.

They rather talk about their organic wines. Think of the blood on their hands, next time you're drinking their Armador.
1259 2018-08-15 21:19:49 Inside sources say it’s Grangemouth oil and they are burning the gas
1260 2018-08-15 21:19:41 A vat of oil? Is this 1908?
1261 2018-08-15 21:19:36 nah bro im not gone rock with his slip and slide baby oil addict ass
1262 2018-08-15 21:19:26 @Pennzoil is the best oil and has been since my first car 10 years ago, probably much longer than that.
1263 2018-08-15 21:19:21 Coming friday is my birthday and I need a special cake made from PALM OIL.
1264 2018-08-15 21:19:21 Someone just insulted Diana Ross; they’re going to give me the death sentence in Maryland. I’ll stuff a flammable polyester throw down there throat, them fill every origine if there body with flammable oil, then shove them in a bonfire. No one disrespects Diana Ross and lives
1265 2018-08-15 21:19:19 Oil compsnies dont care. The CEO has a house in new zealand where they don't do fracking.
1266 2018-08-15 21:19:15 It smells like oil inside  my car and not the good oil
1267 2018-08-15 21:19:13 Deepening worries about global economic growth, particularly in China, set off a rout in riskier assets including technology stocks, copper and crude oil. U.S. retailers took a drubbing after Macy's reported weaker sales.

1271 2018-08-15 21:18:43 Our problem in the cities is our sedentary lifestyles and super refined carbohydrates.  We are not moving enough.  Especially in car dependent ones.  As the sticker on a bike I once saw said "Burn fat not oil"
1272 2018-08-15 21:18:40 I would have agreed with you until I had a halloumi burger @bristolcitywfc one evening. Try it thinly sliced and lightly fried in a good olive oil. The saltiness goes well with fresh salad in pita
1273 2018-08-15 21:18:36 My grandmother was a fortune teller and could read tea leafs I could never see what she saw until her passing when her thoughts came true. God bless her, There is some truth to be found in patterns of behaviour including binary. Behaviourism v Gestault .
1274 2018-08-15 21:18:35 The Hydra is THE TRUTH on light oil! If the Rogue is anything like it’s older sibling (the Sigma Sting) it’ll make for a heck of a one-two punch!
1275 2018-08-15 21:18:32 Racist alert. What's wrong with Italians?
Why not use oil, then you can't see POC
1276 2018-08-15 21:18:12 Drink up Disaronno(apricot kernel oil)! Need a ride to or from the bar? Get there free w/ Lyft code: INVITES //Deal for me, you, him, her, & everyone else! ;)

1278 2018-08-15 21:17:55 It would appear that you’re actually happiest when big oil is shoveling money your way. Acting like the GOP is a sure way to fail in future elections.

1279 2018-08-15 21:17:52 I don’t use any products in my hair this go round like I did with my first dreads. Just oil and water daily and wash when needed. No type of gels, nuthin
1280 2018-08-15 21:17:37 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for lavender bath bombs, and put some lemongrass essential oil in my diffuser.
1281 2018-08-15 21:17:36 Lifter tick came back because my oil drain plug ain’t snug , but s/o to @_dirtbagdan for helping me find out what was causing it
1282 2018-08-15 21:17:31 Oven fried eggplant with roasted cherry tomatoes, green pepper and mushroom with a side of Angel hair pasta tossed with basil, garlic and olive oil. Yum!
1283 2018-08-15 21:17:30 LMAO Africans that Use our rituals and say its Christianity..  

Something like using handkerchief.. Or pouring olive oil on the floor 

We are all. Jokers
1284 2018-08-15 21:17:29 At Valvoline getting my oil changed & the guy said “just so you know your highlight is blinding me even through your tinted windows” 
1285 2018-08-15 21:17:14 The food was terrific- from the portobello mushroom pizza with truffle oil to the chocolate torte. 
1286 2018-08-15 21:17:12 I need to replace the oil pump in my pick-up. Over a $1,000 to take it in.

Eff that

I just spent $90.00 on parts
-oil pump
-Seal kit for cover and water pump
-timing chain and sprockets

I spent more than that for tools

$111 harmonic balancer installer
$51. Harmonic remover

1288 2018-08-15 21:17:09 Getting a oil change/car inspection is top tier of annoying adult responsibilities

1296 2018-08-15 21:15:43 Also, why do oil changes get more expensive with each passing oil change
1297 2018-08-15 21:14:58 pika
1298 2018-08-15 21:14:55 Right, fraudulent science, the same shit powering your connection to the Internet right now, the same science that turned the oil you’re protecting into that plastic keyboard your typing on...Or are them jest “Jesus Particles”? It’s all the same science, it’s not fraudulent...
1299 2018-08-15 21:14:54 Literally drenched myself in oil
1300 2018-08-15 21:14:53 I find that if the mushrooms are fried gently separately and then placed on strategically just before the cheese, it should roll off provided the pan is non-stick and a small amount of oil is used.
1301 2018-08-15 21:14:50 Hi everyone, I’m a licensed esthetician. Cerave does not have a single ingredient that benefits acneic skin. That scrub has coconut oil in it that will clog your pores & then spoil inside them. I advise everyone not to do this routine & see an esthetician instead to get products.
1302 2018-08-15 21:14:49 Call me
1303 2018-08-15 21:14:34 He'll never reply you,till a camel pass through the eye of a needle.
1304 2018-08-15 21:14:33 Do any furpals take cod liver oil or anything else for dry itchy skin - maybe eczema??
1305 2018-08-15 21:14:31 Agree allow your hair to dry a lil bit and then re wrap your style and put head scarf on ...also use a oil silk spray just to keep your hair from getting brittle
1306 2018-08-15 21:14:27 Someone else suggested it could be the brand of oil, what did you use? That's a cheaper/easier fix than everything else I've read about 
1307 2018-08-15 21:14:10 Olive oil hasn't been used in the production of catgut for over a century. (E8 Fromage)
1308 2018-08-15 21:14:03 I’ve had mayonnaise cake. It doesn’t taste mayonnaisey. Remember, mayo is mostly egg yolk and oil — not odd things to put in cake batter.

1313 2018-08-15 21:13:05 would be nice if #cannabis patients had this type of access and options elsewhere; no dabs or flower but vape oil ok @ $225/gram in NY = #mmj program is punitive and failing #patients @NYGovCuomo @SafeAccess @THEMMEXCHANGE
1314 2018-08-15 21:13:04 You are out of your mind if you think he is no different than Weinstein. Really warped. With all the hate, no one has charged him with anything. Ivana was his wife. ISIS compared now with then is unrecognizable. No govt exporting oil for one. It is decimated. Rootin for ISIS R U?
1315 2018-08-15 21:12:51 baby you need to check my oil and put water in my radiator pls
1316 2018-08-15 21:12:51 Deoxydevil weakly shakes his head.
"N-no... probably not. Just-just want gem back. Need... to be normal."
Wheeze, drooling oil, grabs for Dial's hand.

1317 2018-08-15 21:12:47 I would love to see Keegan Lowe Back In Edmonton One of the best Oil kings defence men of all time that still belongs To Griffin But Keegan is up there with TJ Foster Griffin And Jarry Top 4  favourite oil kings of all time no doubt about it
1318 2018-08-15 21:12:35 No offence but before oil came to ye yere best ever player was probably Niall Quinn or some other bum, the way you said he's the best player you ever seen in a blue shirt was like man city actually have a record of having world class players.

1320 2018-08-15 21:12:25 My mother was once in the yard while the fence rows were being cleared of brush. The wind was blowing and she got poison ivy in her eyes, nose, face, all exposed skin from the oil in the air. Nasty stuff! Be careful!
1321 2018-08-15 21:12:25 Eating too much sugar. Sweet blood. Shower in lemon body wash and use a citronella body oil or spray.
1322 2018-08-15 21:12:22 Next mf that wanna holler “damn girl” at the shell can pay for my fucking gas and oil while u at it big boy
1323 2018-08-15 21:11:54 Never again am I going to come for an oil change or battery replacement they took 2 hours!
1324 2018-08-15 21:11:48 Dear Lawrence Chamber of Commerce why do we have four CBD oil stores and only one Starbucks drive thru please respond at earliest convenience

1325 2018-08-15 21:11:43 I want to meet the snake oil salesman who convinced the country that corn was a vegetable and not a grain
1326 2018-08-15 21:11:39 Nothing like dropping your car off at @FirestoneAuto at lunch (for an oil change + inspection), going to pick it up after work (over 4 hours later), just to find out it hasn’t even been looked at 
1327 2018-08-15 21:11:33 I would definitely recommend CBD Oil before I would put my dog on an addictive benzodiasapine. It helped my sister's dog tremendously when he had Cancer and Arthritis. Plus it's great for anxiety. It also helps me with my Fibromyalgia and chronic pain/anxiety
1328 2018-08-15 21:11:27 Bro I’m just trying to get a oil change ..... shit is taking forever
1329 2018-08-15 21:11:25 Thought I was finna fry some fish then BOOM no fuckn oil
1330 2018-08-15 21:11:10 Yep..and when they ask why, simply state it is a very unique cake which much more expensive
1331 2018-08-15 21:11:09 1) If the low oil theory is correct, we should see inverse correlation, maybe with a few months lag.

2) Interesting graph. May look different when focusing on hospitality industry, though.
1332 2018-08-15 21:10:58 Mine did that until we changed the oil again. Very common!
1333 2018-08-15 21:10:58 Oh, maybe because these other countries are funding the anti oil sand campaign and doing it very successfully.
1334 2018-08-15 21:10:51 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1335 2018-08-15 21:10:48 4 stages of oil painting

1340 2018-08-15 21:10:10 When you are on the go, or don’t have a mint plant, I recommend OrthoMolecular Peppermint capsules or peppermint essential oil

1342 2018-08-15 21:09:53 dropped communism. 20 years later,owns 50% or more of every major bank, oil, mineral, & manufacturing company. It owns 90% of every terrestrial TV broadcast network. Its President has been in power for 20 years, despite that pretend switch with Medvedev. Sounds like USSR.
1343 2018-08-15 21:09:52 Hope you bought the baby oil 
1344 2018-08-15 21:09:51 Vindictive, vicious, liar, selling snake oil= trump

i'm very dumb margot
1346 2018-08-15 21:09:17 eggs lemon oil salt c'mon!
1347 2018-08-15 21:09:14 I agree with this. We don’t want oil riggers that close to our beaches.
1348 2018-08-15 21:09:07 My Dad had curly hair and my Mom wavy hair!! Used to straighten my hair back in high school!! Now my hair has decided to be affected by humidity and has a mind of it's own! Use dry oil products but strands still pop up!!

1351 2018-08-15 21:08:50 Aight... It's evident that I haven't lived until I visit Grenada, attend Spice Mas and get oil up wid de Jab Jab and dem. I am ready. See you when I'm financially stable. 
1352 2018-08-15 21:08:42 Have you found anything that works really well?? All I’ve tried is bio oil and I think it’s helped but I kind of want to try something else.
1353 2018-08-15 21:08:13 He may not be yelling fire in a crowded theater, but yelling at the crowds in the theatre to set fire to the place, at his command.

Just as importantly, who the hell are these people who listen to him and don’t think he’s either unhinged, or just a crazed  oil salesman?!?!
1354 2018-08-15 21:08:12 I think it's good news. Revoking the liars sends a clear message. Don't lie to All Americans to promote your fake wars for regime change for OIL and $$$
1355 2018-08-15 21:08:02 Excellent post...Sindaynoname seems to be the sort that would claw your eyeballs out and boil them in oil if you even dare cross her!!! Her gramofinstant has some very interesting pics....not the least of which is her admiration for the Attessa IV!!!

1357 2018-08-15 21:07:58 ... por el tipo de aguas subterraneas que tenemos, el tema es que como ing. Mecánico que ha trabajado en el sector oil and gas soy consciente de los errores ingenieriles que se cometen en el pais, sumele eso a lo anterior.

1359 2018-08-15 21:07:41 Is oil money a curse or a blessing?
1360 2018-08-15 21:07:31 The fire is being kindled under the feet of a 24-hour man who feeds the American public with snake oil, convincing the rubes that his drink will make our country great again. He continues to clem with our allies,  makes sure that his cronies are on the show...

1365 2018-08-15 21:07:11 Just made friends with one of the prettiest strangers I’ve ever met at the shop, waitin for my oil to get changed. She left, cane back, and told me bye. I feel really special tbh (:
1366 2018-08-15 21:07:08 It’s essentially like using olive oil, but more flavor
1367 2018-08-15 21:07:00 just made the First Official Grocery Run of the new apartment and fellas, the most expensive thing I bought, clocking in at about $6 was,,, olive oil, the most essential staple of any kitchen
1368 2018-08-15 21:06:57 The NYT reports that #Germany is struggling to curb its reliance on coal power and is in danger of missing its #ClimateChange targets. Or maybe their politicians are scared that they are about to lose Big Oil and Big Coal donors.
1369 2018-08-15 21:06:55 I’ll be there Saturday morning!!!
1370 2018-08-15 21:06:50 Jajajajajajjajaj gracias, es que uso sunblock en la cara y oil en el cuerpo, no me gusta coger sol en la cara

1374 2018-08-15 21:06:17 Great!!!
He is nothing but a lying warmonger. Get rid of clearances for all past IC. Maybe the bombing for Oil and $$$ will let up.
1375 2018-08-15 21:06:10 People are trying to prove that the Bible is a metaphor for marijuana consumption. I agree. There are a few passages which seem to make sense. Moses' anointing oil was also made with cannabis.
1376 2018-08-15 21:06:09 Love how the rest of us are always cast as “foolish” and misguided, while they say Islam and/or Mexicans are the worst. Worse than everything in our own backyards: factory farming, crushing debt, oil spills, election fraud

1380 2018-08-15 21:04:58 Tell me more of this Turkish oil wrestling ??
1381 2018-08-15 21:04:45 This is a good thing, as soon as they pump ALL the oil out, texas won't be worth a shit any more (If it ever was), and we can give it back to Mexico!
1382 2018-08-15 21:04:36 I used a cream & oil from a brand called “the spoiled mama” they’re kind of expensive but good cause I never got any stretch marks

1384 2018-08-15 21:04:27 Pour oil on his head.
1385 2018-08-15 21:04:24 It most certainly is and that is why Robidas Island was such a genius play. It was the perfect time to do it & the Maple Leafs used it to their full advantage. Edmonton is not in that position.
1386 2018-08-15 21:04:04 coconut oil and tea tree oil are the answers
1387 2018-08-15 21:04:03 Tea tree oil clears it up lol

1391 2018-08-15 21:03:46 Looking kind of N/E from my window in hamilton (over towards the big pylons at shotts) and the sky is flashing orange between clouds?? Is this from the oil refineries at grangemouth? #scotland

1397 2018-08-15 21:02:35 Energy East was always about exporting western oil from the East Coast, not about freeing us from needing imported oil. We should have had a pipeline connection to Alberta decades ago, but EE isn't that project.

1400 2018-08-15 21:02:30 @theJagmeetSingh ....when are you going to apologize to Albertans for saying their energy is not fit for eastern Canada and yet blood oil is so right to import?
1401 2018-08-15 21:02:28 Some gearboxes can be extremely sensitive to even the brand of oil (ridiculous as that is, since the standard it complies with should ensure its all compatible and same characteristics)
No direct experience with your kind of Volvo though, so don't know if that applies...
1402 2018-08-15 21:02:24 With due respect Kurt, how exactly is this position any different than last season? This injury happened late in the summer & they have a talented kid in Bouchard in the system but better equipped? Don't see it.
1403 2018-08-15 21:02:19 Ah gotcha. The piston set up liked familiar to me. My old Datsun had Hitachi SU style carbs. Always fun to tell people "time to check my carb oil"
1404 2018-08-15 21:02:12 Come on in tonight and try one of our awesome pizzas. On special tonight we have a California pizza which is a pear, bacon, goat cheese with an garlic oil base! It taste amazing!
1405 2018-08-15 21:02:10 O+ or -? They love universal donors...copious garlic and red wine work for me (and/or mix some lemon eucalyptus oil w/carrier oil & apply liberally outta the shower).
1406 2018-08-15 21:02:08 Hi Emily, a synthetic oil change will be a little bit more than $19.99. Please check with your local Sears Auto Center for an accurate quote… Thanks!
1407 2018-08-15 21:01:53 I saw a B-17 take off one morning at Oshkosh with the sunrise behind it. Some combination of water and/or oil spinning off the propeller tips made a very similar spiral tube. So very cool!
1408 2018-08-15 21:01:44 I don't eat grilled cheese. Never have. It tasted like burned oil and stale French fries.
1409 2018-08-15 21:01:41 If this account gets banned please follow my Alt account @giantbingers. It's mostly just videos of me clearing 5 gram bowls and hitting hash oil Riggs.
1410 2018-08-15 21:01:40 @teamabrams this man you just retweeted spearheaded bringing back oil money to the party..... thats not winning, thats corruption at the expense of the planet and the people living in it
1411 2018-08-15 21:01:30 Transiting through Lombok passage with Bali and Lombok on either sides. Very worrying to see such dense shipping traffic with no local regulations or monitoring in place. An oil spill from a ship will have disastrous consequences here.@BBPB_bali #Bali
1412 2018-08-15 21:01:25 Single mass, clad in blue, their bayonets pointing skyward. As Wilfred McClay points out in the oil business.
1413 2018-08-15 21:01:18 If anyone should be worried about China expansionism, it should be Russia. With Russia's declining birthrate, Siberia will be open territory with oil fields for the taking. By 2050, could see something happening there.
1414 2018-08-15 21:01:06 Hope it ain’t dripping oil or water
1415 2018-08-15 21:00:55 Any experience on oil pulling on the TL? I tried it once.
1416 2018-08-15 21:00:42 Come for an oil change leaving with a new tire and battery smh
1417 2018-08-15 21:00:35 Got out of bed, got dressed, cause I had to go get an oil change for my Jeep. This adulting thing is expensive.
1418 2018-08-15 21:00:32 August 15, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1419 2018-08-15 21:00:32 I would send them a link about oil wrestling.

1421 2018-08-15 21:00:29 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1422 2018-08-15 21:00:26 My mom makes this but she bastes with olive oil and vinegar and then mixes it with a blend of diced celery, celery leaves and slice garlic.
Screw your neighbors. Jealously is an awful trait.
1423 2018-08-15 21:00:23 Social media and things you like don't go together at all oil and water I tell you
1424 2018-08-15 21:00:20 Yes, people make such a big deal about oil. We pollute so many other ways that effects the earth. Activists are so narrow minded and hypocritical. Why not help clean things up instead stamping their feet and pointing fingers.
1425 2018-08-15 21:00:17 I’ve used lime infused olive oil on stovetop. Salt.
1426 2018-08-15 21:00:05 It is the government rules that prevent speedy cleanup of oil spills. If the winch on the boat that hauls up the netting of soaked oil blankets drips A SINGLE DROP, the owner of the boat is exorbitantly fined. They take no consideration for circumstances.
1427 2018-08-15 21:00:05 Fuck hearts. The tin man just needed oil for his joints and I need bullshit like omega 3 and yoga
1428 2018-08-15 21:00:02 My family can no more get along with your family than oil mixes with water.
ぼくの家族と君の家族が仲良く過ごせるというのは，水と油が混ざるというくらいありえない話だ。
1429 2018-08-15 21:00:00 The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is, indeed, about as useful as a backwards one-way sign:
1430 2018-08-15 20:59:57 Can somebody tell how criticizing the DNC chair for taking oil and gas money is racist?
1431 2018-08-15 20:59:47 YOU DID NOT INCLUDE SEX FOR OIL BLOCK! BABA JAPO JAPO!
1432 2018-08-15 20:59:33 @RonDeSantisFL I guess the waters off Florida aren’t quite polluted enough so you need to kill more fish by oil drilling. Start right in front of Mar A Lago.
1433 2018-08-15 20:59:33 CBD oil and guac is what I replaced those with
1434 2018-08-15 20:59:09 Sorry Sen. sanders but Sec. Zinke is right as I lived in an out lying sub division and forestry required the home owners cut all under growth every year up to 8 or 10 feet above ground especially tan oak which emits an oil which is highly flammable.

1438 2018-08-15 20:58:32 JP how did you learn to read the charts?
They look to me like you could shove a line anywhere?
1439 2018-08-15 20:58:26 Oil can float so no matter where you are ,one oil spill is one too many
1440 2018-08-15 20:58:10 My car got an oil change and I feel like a new bitch
1441 2018-08-15 20:57:55 Turkish Lira weighing on oil and oil prices tends to come off after Labor Day week end of summer and going into normal scheduled maintenance at refineries 
1442 2018-08-15 20:57:54 I think the world may start to recover when all the world's oil is gone.  By then, it'll probably be too late.
1443 2018-08-15 20:57:54 Hormuz is the world's busiest oil bottleneck. What else?

You could have points on Suez/Bab al-Mandab, but Iran/Saud fighting over the Persian Gulf doesn't directly impact the Red Sea straights...except for the passage of oil.
1444 2018-08-15 20:57:44 Not only Vat , UPA also left a huge external debt of lakhs of crores by not paying the oil imports. When it became clear they were losing they emptied the coffers
1445 2018-08-15 20:57:43 Congratulations big oil you'll leave us with nothing but renewables, just be ready for the day long recharge of your car and the fortune it will cost to upgrade said car
1446 2018-08-15 20:57:38 وشو زيت اللوز ولا e oil ؟؟
1447 2018-08-15 20:57:36 Eucalyptus oil gets rid of sticky residue, plus it smells nice.
1448 2018-08-15 20:57:22 Al is a race baiting, tax dodging, snake oil salesman and one of the worst purveyors of taking advantage of American black people.
1449 2018-08-15 20:57:13 That sounds yummy! I used CBD oil and noticed many benefits. Sleep better, digestion is better too, just an overall better sense of well being. I will need to order more...
1450 2018-08-15 20:57:04 Holy coconut oil
1451 2018-08-15 20:57:01 its all shit, we went to war because Neocons thought we could bring Democracy by force and turn them into allies and abuse their oil. That's pretty much the length of it.
1452 2018-08-15 20:56:58 Gotta get an oil change this weekend
1453 2018-08-15 20:56:52 Oil
1454 2018-08-15 20:56:40 Happy Birthday @JohnFetterman! You should ask @WolfForPA to join you in signing the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge for you birthday! We want you for Lt Gov, but we want a Governor who puts people before the profit of oil and gas!
1455 2018-08-15 20:56:38 Good.... Let's lead the world in oil production.....
1456 2018-08-15 20:56:35 Don't care. He's helping get jobs. Snake oil ran dry, bro
1457 2018-08-15 20:56:29 Hey @scylla17, I have a barrel full of snake oil in my cellar. It can be yours for just $100!  #Qanonsense
1458 2018-08-15 20:56:17 I do. Its just that this establishment puts oil in their vegetables. So I legitimately cannot afford the extra cals lol
1459 2018-08-15 20:55:55 went down the rabbit hole and watched the palm oil video can’t stop thinking about eugenics xx
1460 2018-08-15 20:55:53 It’s at @Gatetenevents, directly across the South Lot and Lucas Oil Stadium.
1461 2018-08-15 20:55:53 Actually its more of along the lines of scientific consensus. So you're no different than the oil industry attacking climate change consensus.  Or another example you're no different than a anti vaccine attacking vaccine consensus.
The scientific conesus states they are safe.
1462 2018-08-15 20:55:47 No officer I swear it’s my beard oil. Sir you are clean shaved... 
1463 2018-08-15 20:55:45 Why does Hollywood ignore their own back yard?  Apparently the dirtiest oil in all of North America comes from California.
1464 2018-08-15 20:55:40 This is an example of how our leadership makes it quite apparent the climate scam is just that. If the world was truly burning up due to carbon, there would be no exceptions for foreign oil. No subsidies for the largest emitters. No jetting to Davos by the hundreds for junkets.
1465 2018-08-15 20:55:39 But, but, but, "PEAK OIL!!!!"
1466 2018-08-15 20:55:15 See the way droplets of oil dey burn but dem carry opana in whole body chock hot pot of oil inside he commot he say he dey go write book. John be harrd guy!
1467 2018-08-15 20:55:09 Kardai a mantamu. 
1468 2018-08-15 20:55:09 He’s no oil painting...
1469 2018-08-15 20:55:00 And that very well could happen if you believe oil heads back to $100 USD in the coming couple years and remains in that range for any significant period of time. I do. Trump is postponing the inevitable.
1470 2018-08-15 20:54:56 Try Castor oil..
1471 2018-08-15 20:54:53 I didn't realize she supported Palin until you pointed it out & frankly that alone calls into question her judgment no less than if she had plunged her hand into bubbling oil

I used a mixer and it didn't take long. when you tale it out of the bowl and it's not stating together forming a nice ball add more flour till it does
1475 2018-08-15 20:54:17 There is no such thing as a gooder girl than Pyrrha
1476 2018-08-15 20:53:51 Bio oil!!!! Only thing I found that worked! But it’s so expensive 
1477 2018-08-15 20:53:50 But you voted in favor of an oil pipeline here in the mainland, over the objections and active resistance by landowners. Do you have any principles?
1478 2018-08-15 20:53:46 Everytime oil crosses $60, those guys fracking in the Dakotas just open up the spigot.
1479 2018-08-15 20:53:41  always a treat to get a massage at Sanctuary on 2nd, and today we went with the CBD oil (instead of my usual bergamot /lavender). I'm so relaxed & my sore muscles feel very chill  You guys are the BEST!
1480 2018-08-15 20:53:28 Take political correctness & throw it out the door.  People like this need to be sent packing.  Their religion mixes with the Western culture about as much and oil and water mix together .  What’s wrong with the MSM that they won’t report this news?
1481 2018-08-15 20:53:17 It’s about time y’all resurface that video w/the woman dancing to Future & getting her body rubbed w/body oil. Lol
1482 2018-08-15 20:53:08 *drowns self in truffle oil*
1483 2018-08-15 20:52:59 I've decided I want some chest/belly haird since I have like next to zero hair so i asked some friends around and they tolld me castor oil may help.

I've been rubbing it in my belly like thrice already and I can already feel my brain sending big boy hair energies.
1484 2018-08-15 20:52:48 I am Type 1 for almost 50 years! Well, 47 to be exact. A job I had a few years ago was extremely stressful, not sure how I lived through it. Menopause and stress are not a good combo. But I did find CBD oil really helped and smoking a bit at night also...
1485 2018-08-15 20:51:56 I'm back...with a tip: use Brazilian nut oil to leave hair soft after wash day

More likely it's because this generation is likely to try more interesting food and mayo is just eggs and oil.

1504 2018-08-15 20:50:21 How has non-oil GDP been looking these past 3yrs? What is that sector in Nigeria that has grown by any measure (revenue & jobs) since 2015? Oil prices r as fickle as a petulant child -no need to delve-in Growing the economy needs a sharp intelligent brain. Do we have that in PMB?
1505 2018-08-15 20:50:17 I thought they were oil stains.  To lubricate engine/coggs etc.
1506 2018-08-15 20:50:15 The Danes' dirty secret is that its public sector has been propped up by--now dwindling--oil revenues.
1507 2018-08-15 20:50:09 Thank you for taking the time to reply-  Sustainably scouring is great - would be good if your package communicated this - I don’t think palm oil is a popular ingredient amongst consumers looking for natural products- love the nut butter range

1512 2018-08-15 20:49:44 Debt payments and share buybacks is what must happen. Cpg is still generating strong cash flow, with $200 million annual dividends; meanwhile a company like Baytex with maturing debt at 6.5% interest rate and subject to 25% WCS diffs is scarier if you think oil prices sink.
1513 2018-08-15 20:49:39 I'm sure it's the right oil, and I checked the level when it first started doing it and it was fine! I will check again tomorrow in case it's lost any though. I'm wondering if it's something electrical, just because that's the cause of every other problem in that car 
1514 2018-08-15 20:49:37 You mean in eastern Canada because in the prairies I have never seen a Saudi Arabia medical professional. Apparently eastern Canada depends on the Saudis for oil, university students and who knows what else. Well maybe eastern Canada shouldn't depend on Saudi Arabia.

1516 2018-08-15 20:48:46 John, if Scotland has huge natural resources why did the oil industry ask f9r financial support the year after the vote, also the cost would be astronomical to the average Scot for the initial set up of an independent country. The same as brexit...
1517 2018-08-15 20:48:42 It doesn't matter what they are fried in. Much as I love fish and chips I can't eat them for the oil. Strangely, no other fried food has this effect.
1518 2018-08-15 20:48:40 if u wanna loose some drink alot of water 2 cups the morning before anything,  eat to 1500 calories a day with ligjt exercice , like we usually take 2000 cal
So yeah i tried to eat just an egg a tomato half an onion some olive oil and a fruit in a day..(500 cal) It was bad dhdhb
1519 2018-08-15 20:48:33 Trust no one who ever utters the words "And we fry it in heart healthy canola oil." No. No. Just no. It's not. Pardon me while I go fry some chicken in preservative free grass fed beef tallow that won't kill me.
1520 2018-08-15 20:48:31 Still, it’s embarrassing and just plain wrong that this immoral, malignantly narcissistic, life-long money launderer and snake oil salesman has ANY say in anything of consequence. Need #Justice now.
1521 2018-08-15 20:48:06 Or maybe there's some context in those numbers that you're missing?  His tenure started with the Great Recession and that was followed by the US shale oil boom driving oil revenues WAY down.  Clearly he did a better job than most others handling these economic challenges.
1522 2018-08-15 20:47:50 @hallublin I agree with you on olives. They are only good in oil form. #WeGotThis
1523 2018-08-15 20:47:50 Apparently it does, because given that oil and gas is such a lucrative sector, it does account for a huge proportion of the economy. That would not be the case if it were fish or forestry for example. So yup, the source is clearly relevant.
1524 2018-08-15 20:47:44 i wish i had some oil to cook with.
1525 2018-08-15 20:47:37 Niqqa,u r a matte.I swear your brain dey leak oil.
1526 2018-08-15 20:47:37 Yeah I understand seeing depiction and more insight in the real events can be immersive and absorbing.  The technicality of Deepwater Horizon worked very well because of how brutal and relentless the oil rig explosion was.  Also, very violent for a PG-13 rating, surprised by that
1527 2018-08-15 20:47:33 in time this will be the super rich down fall because of greed of the power of oil

1529 2018-08-15 20:47:25 When did Argan Oil become a thing?
1530 2018-08-15 20:47:20 Balfour was British. The British Empire wanted the oil fields & made sure the French got the less stable Syrian region. Creating a Jewish state seemed like a practical & effective tool to usurp the Ottoman Palestine under British influence. Med gives nautical control of Suez.

1534 2018-08-15 20:46:46 Wrong. The Democratic Party is beyond reform. They just decided to start taking money from Big Oil. Again. They’re actively and openly sabotaging progressives across the country. I’d much rather deal with the hard work of starting something new than to work with them.
1535 2018-08-15 20:46:20 so cbd oil , took ibuprofen , went to chiropractor , used essential oils ....and still having jaw pain....seriously just shoot me 
1536 2018-08-15 20:46:06 that dawn commercial when they’re cleaning the oil off those lil animals makes me wanna cry lmfaoooo I’m so pregnant bro 
1537 2018-08-15 20:45:58 not even about oil anymore. US has outsourced most of it's manufacturing so it's up to the war machine to keep chugging cuz if they don't what will power our economy? What  happens if Northrup, Boeing, etc don't have anyone to bomb and all fail? pretty sad tbh
1538 2018-08-15 20:45:56 It’s not about Erdogan only, Turkey has had literal hand in helping ISIS continue to thrive inside Syria for years. Buying oil, opening borders. Turkey was legit point of transfer for terrorists, turkey is an a accomplice. That’s it
1539 2018-08-15 20:45:53 Just got a voicemail on my personal cell from this oil company asking when they could get their “Candy Machine” serviced. Like?  What does that even mean and how did they wind up getting my number.

1544 2018-08-15 20:45:46 Despite directing much of their political platform against fossil fuels and in favor of green, energy-killing regulations, Democrats accepted more than $7 million from oil and gas companies during the 2016 election.   Fact!
1545 2018-08-15 20:45:40 I'm a production accountant for an oil and gas company.   Every month we have to allocate produced gas and products to their proper owners and submit all government reporting.   It's done through computer programs but there is still lots of work involved.

1548 2018-08-15 20:45:06 and rosehip seed oil works great if you think bio oil is too heavy

1555 2018-08-15 20:44:05 Why does Friendlys take so long for an oil change 
1556 2018-08-15 20:44:04 At least Alabama made Checkers and a weird way to clean up oil spills.
1557 2018-08-15 20:43:57 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
1558 2018-08-15 20:43:51 Oil plunged contagion  fears. U.S commercial crude -oil inventories are above the five-year average for first time in several months

1560 2018-08-15 20:43:22 The reaction to Trump is similar to the reaction when Reagan, a Hollywood actor, got elected. Reagan closed his speech to the ALF-CIO on March 30, 1981, with these words: “Together we'll make America great again.” Moments later he was shot by the son of a wealthy Texas oil exec.

1564 2018-08-15 20:42:50 Because oil is a globally traded commodity.  What the Sauds do indirectly affects our markets.

1567 2018-08-15 20:42:28 Maybe that’s my problem because when I fry something I go hotter than that so it sizzles when it hits the oil. Maybe I just need to be patient?

1571 2018-08-15 20:41:57 Gaining momentum is not the same as being competitive. Solar is a fine alternative now, but there is a timeline where Standard Oil wasn't broken up and it was able prevent solar from getting close to viability.
1572 2018-08-15 20:41:56 I’m definitely signing that petition..... we should go to Pluckers after i get my oil changed in Gonzales
1573 2018-08-15 20:41:51 Nope, kuthiwe weed in it’s rawest form cause I also asked whether I shouldn’t try the oil instead of the plant. Apparently if you mix it in castor oil it does the pots.
1574 2018-08-15 20:41:50 How come getting an oil change at Midas always takes 2 hours. Something isn’t right.
1575 2018-08-15 20:41:10 Lmao the nail shop lady always be asking about my leg tattoo as if it changed from the last appointment. Just sssh and keep massaging the oil on it

1583 2018-08-15 20:40:09 If it doesn’t smell like oil and some guy named Dale then it won’t remind me of home
1584 2018-08-15 20:40:04 Rosemary and olive oil or cracked pepper and olive oil work pretty good.

1590 2018-08-15 20:39:16 i just found out that you’re not supposed to use coconut oil on your skin, but like bitch i use that shut everyday
1591 2018-08-15 20:39:01 It's to appeal to, as T Blair put it, Mondeo man. The average voter has no real understanding and so when Corbyns snake oil compromise is rejected he can then double down on his Jews as the bad guys bit and they'll buy it.
1592 2018-08-15 20:38:55 Baking soda , coconut oil , witch hazel combination for clear skin quick. Thank me later

1596 2018-08-15 20:38:28 The Kurdish language banned again by the Ministry of Oil in Kirkuk.

1600 2018-08-15 20:38:06 Putting a couple drops of CBD oil in my herbal tea before bed has been working 1000× better than Xanax ever has. I sleep deeper, wake up more refreshed, and my head is clear during the day. IF YOU SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA, PLEASE CONSIDER CBD
1601 2018-08-15 20:37:59 Millions of people displaced and torn from their homes and each other. Libya...Iraq...Kobane...they are all starting to look like Gaza. The thinking is, make it bad, so bad and miserable, that people flee...leaving their oil rich homelands, their rightful fruit...
1602 2018-08-15 20:37:56 Venezuela fell because their central planners cannot allocate resources effectively. They decided to put all capital into oil, and when that market didn't go so well they collapsed. Central planning socialists sucks
1603 2018-08-15 20:37:56 The Rohingya genocide?     Do they sit on a sea of oil?    Iraqis, Iranians, and Venezuelans all sit on "seas of oil."  Syrians sit on a pipeline route.  Afghans have a poppy field.   Rohingyan suffering has apparently nothing to offer the west.

1605 2018-08-15 20:37:54 @Tycen_7324 and I are sitting at the dealership waiting for them to finish changing my oil and one of the workers goes up to an old lady and says “ma’am your cars ready, you had the child safety lock on” then the lady “well I didn’t do it” 
1606 2018-08-15 20:37:54 That was the German plan (China bought the whole technology from them for next to nothing) years ago. Steam temperatures are much higher than regular reactors so you can use coal or oil fired steam equipment directly. Can also run gas turbines directly - no steam cycle. V. Smart
1607 2018-08-15 20:37:28 Naaahhhh, you're not dumb though, you're actually really smart. I get these stupid idiots in all the time and they're getting oil or brake pads and they go "well aren't YOU supposed to tell ME what kind of car it is?" BITCH
1608 2018-08-15 20:37:28 Sorry to see the algae oil pills are in bovine gelatin capsules.  :-(
1609 2018-08-15 20:37:24 Few people know how many "small businesses" there are with well-coiffed CEOs who bring in "average" salaries like these. We have a few oil wells in Illinois, owned by little known companies that distribute through the "majors".  There are destroying the planet.
1610 2018-08-15 20:37:13 What oil price rally ?? The thing is just collapsing.. Soon we may see the rig count decreasing.

1612 2018-08-15 20:37:07 I know I'm saying I wish I could get that dark. I've never gone out of my way to tan, as in putting tanning oil or whatever on and laying out, but I bet I wouldnt get much darker than I normally am. I stay roughly this color year round, only get a tiny bit darker or lighter
1613 2018-08-15 20:37:01 Have they tried cannabis oil, apparently it cures fucking everything, it’s the drug that’s makes people walk again, cure cancer, makes limbs grow back, bring people back from the dead even, so I’ve read.

1615 2018-08-15 20:36:39 The orangutans may be able to survive temporarily but it's the feeling a person gets when visiting these beautiful creatures that fuels the passion to go against the palm oil plantations and raise awareness.
1616 2018-08-15 20:36:31 #OrangutanJungleSchool there are so many products that don't contain palm oil. people need to find out more and cut down the demand. We need to stop their land being destroyed
1617 2018-08-15 20:36:25 What do you think our generation is doing that’s gonna cause cancer in the future? You know like how people didn’t know smoking would give them lung cancer. Also the problem who tanned in baby oil ended up with skin cancer.
1618 2018-08-15 20:36:14 The US will rob the future Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Iraq and Syria treasury, confiscate its oil, kill the men, occupy the land, steal historical monuments. A country that carries no human value...

1626 2018-08-15 20:35:32 Your "Nothing else" is not backed by facts. Non-oil sector was out growing the oil sector at various quarters and agriculture was even the biggest contribution to GDP in various quarters during GEJ's time. Saying he did it only because commodity prices spiked is disingenuous.

1669 2018-08-15 20:30:19 Not my priority stockpile items, I'm stockpiling organic Extra Virgin olive oil.
1670 2018-08-15 20:30:12 Nope! It wasn’t “strip” wax though. She said that they only carry that type of wax there. Cruelty free, made with jojoba oil and aloe and some other stuff 
1671 2018-08-15 20:30:11 You're right , but I mostly meant preventing American/European multinationals (especially in oil and other high-value added industries) to set up shop again just because things were "back to normal."
1672 2018-08-15 20:30:11 Post the 70s oil shortage..let's move coal!!l

Lots off it
1673 2018-08-15 20:29:58 GA All! I have been at hospital all day hooked up to an IV for my monthly infusion of immune globulin. Kind of like an oil change for folks with Primary Immune Disease.  What horrible thing did 45 do today?
1674 2018-08-15 20:29:56 My mom had the biggest smile yesterday , she asked me to change the oil for her car but then i washed the car and added a full tank when i gave it back 
1675 2018-08-15 20:29:54 Dipping fries...into oreo...milkshake..?! You are a disgrace to oreo lovers. Actually come to think of it..you're not, you love oreos so much you're eating fries with it's milkshake! Please tell me I'm right, cuz there's no other reason to dip something cooked in oil, in milk! 
1676 2018-08-15 20:29:39 If you ever want a laugh or a lobotomy just watch 2 seconds of the qvc beauty channel. Such utter tripe. Rose oil, velvety, bargain, usually costs £46 for one bottle… who falls for this?
1677 2018-08-15 20:29:36 Bio Oil will sort that and Vitamin E trust me x
1678 2018-08-15 20:29:31 Black women have beautiful full lips, great hair and smell like Coconut oil 

And my wife wonder why I cheat on her..

1680 2018-08-15 20:28:33 Neither Lac Megantic or Burnaby were caused by an oil company. One was caused by a cheap railroad company and the oyby people excavating without knowing where underground utilities were.
1681 2018-08-15 20:28:21 Snake oil!
1682 2018-08-15 20:28:02 We are pro oil substitution
1683 2018-08-15 20:27:57 Did I fucking mention that @IRJakkob bought me art for my birthday and it's this gorgeous oil painting??
And that @noxypaws sneaked it into my apartment while we're at dinner??. Because 
1684 2018-08-15 20:27:57 Esta mañana, camión ingresando a la Estación de servicios ubicada en Av. Pte Perón y Tratado del Pilar, terminó impactando una columna muy cerca del abastecedor de Gas Oíl.
1685 2018-08-15 20:27:27 Dawg why did I come to nissan to get an oil change on d 15 of this month,   
1686 2018-08-15 20:27:17 I bought it at Clicks. Yea, my skin would burn and get super dry. I guess it was the oil control
1687 2018-08-15 20:27:16 Wow I’ve just watched it! You said you thought it was gel that did it, was it a HomeKit? Yes please I will take some screenshots. How would you like me to credit them? Keep going with the oil too, what a difference!!

1691 2018-08-15 20:27:04 Too much oil in alska.. lot of land owned by Bush and family.. never going to happen
1692 2018-08-15 20:26:55 Jesus! The whole Twitter needs to be dipped in coconut oil.
1693 2018-08-15 20:26:53 The best thing I've seen for years I'll be checking for palm oil now and boycotting
1694 2018-08-15 20:26:51 it's only low because we are forced to sell to a single customer. #StartKM will fetch additional $15 Billion in GDP which will translate into government revenues to pay social programs

And an additional Oil Sands expansion will add more GDP

You like social programs, don't you?
1695 2018-08-15 20:26:38 From my new book: OIL and GOD
SaudiA is caught between Arab Spring’s MB representative democracy & Wahhabi ideology of Qaeda/IS. To claim the high religious ground, Riyadh will not genuinely reform the Wahhabi cult, save for cosmetics.
As for democratic reforms, expect a big zero
1696 2018-08-15 20:26:32 Same thing as me, I also could get you onto an oil rig making quite a bit more than that.

1701 2018-08-15 20:26:08 Unleashed American energy? That started 7 years ago. The boom in shale oil production began in 2008
1702 2018-08-15 20:26:02 Dean isn’t that much bigger. I think his overall appearance helps make him look that way. He has tanned so it gives him more definition with oil, makeup, etc. he has also shaved his arms which again gives more definition. The haircut helps as well.
1703 2018-08-15 20:25:56 I love it
1704 2018-08-15 20:25:25 Yho babe  I will try the massaging thing but I have been using castor oil and coconut oil. Nothing.

1709 2018-08-15 20:24:51 I use HBD oil and it really helps with anxiety.
1710 2018-08-15 20:24:46 I think coconut oil helps repell them cuz I used to get them like crazy but haven’t
1711 2018-08-15 20:24:41 My approach starting doz yrs ago: stock the good stuff, eat to abandon, no room for bad stuff. Give yourself breaks—about QOL, not punishment.

1712 2018-08-15 20:24:37 yes all the deadweight is basically off the cap now.
1713 2018-08-15 20:24:31 @FeelGoodFoods Why do you use Canola oil in your healthy foods? If you want to produce healthy meals, you should look into better alternatives to Canola oil.
1714 2018-08-15 20:24:14 おっけ!抱きしめてよしよしして励ましの言葉をかけて甘いアイスをあげてそのまま帰るね！！
1715 2018-08-15 20:24:07 No it doesn't! Get rid of these spies that do nothing for our health care system and turn off the taps to their oil. Give the boot to loar and hypocrite John Baird too.
1716 2018-08-15 20:24:07 Tung oil works too
1717 2018-08-15 20:24:03 Damn you big oil!!!
1718 2018-08-15 20:24:01 There will always be time for olive oil queens
1719 2018-08-15 20:24:01 Massage your sculp to stimulate blood circulation which will assist in growing it. And try use castor oil too
1720 2018-08-15 20:23:51 I belive you both meant to say whaling away. Clearly this is call to return to clean burning whale oil and subsudies for the strugling whaling industry.
1721 2018-08-15 20:23:51 Hey try roasting garlic (unpeeled cloves tossed with a little olive oil and coarse salt) in the oven... it comes out nutty and slightly sweet. 
1722 2018-08-15 20:23:45 European governments live in the pockets of the establishment. The establishment live in the pockets of the oil rich gulf States! The oil rich gulf states don't want vermin clogging up their wealthy countries, so they end up in every country on the planet but never Saudi Arabia!

1729 2018-08-15 20:21:52 I'm at the shop getting an oil change and realized I need new wiper blades. But what's the point. It never rains in San Diego. Oh well. #Cali #sunnyweatherforever

1732 2018-08-15 20:21:41 Addicts crack me up. You want to do methadone to get well? But afraid of CBD oil products? GTFO!!! You weren't afraid to put that needle in your arm, or crushed pills up your nose. Whats worse? No life or a life free of addiction?
1733 2018-08-15 20:21:39 Oil took us into recession and it brought us out. We could have had a recession in 2009 but for the reserves that OBJ left behind. OBJ may have his faults as human but he did certain things well. The commendation of the escape of recession in 2009 should be give to OBJ.
1734 2018-08-15 20:21:33 I cannot move a pallet filled with oil and batteries  I feel defeated now.
1735 2018-08-15 20:21:30 So now climate change effects the ocean floor? Oil leaks, intentionally sinking decommissioned ships and trash on the beach have nothing to do with it?

1741 2018-08-15 20:20:53 As a Blairite you would surely be terrified that Corbyn in power would ensure appropriate prosecutions for war crimes which have led to the deaths of so many innocent Muslims in countries rich in oil & gas, stolen from them. Blair’s baggage reeks of those corpses.

1747 2018-08-15 20:20:09 Oil
1748 2018-08-15 20:19:39 The main issue will be creating enough differentiation from "Thief who throws oil" and "Halfling who throws oil" to justify a wholly separate class.
1749 2018-08-15 20:19:32 She made oil deals with Tillerson?
1750 2018-08-15 20:19:28 There will be no apology to human rights violators. Oil can be from others and now more canadians have a chance to take Saudi students place. All good.
1751 2018-08-15 20:19:26 If management wishes to keep the goodwill of holders then updating via the website is more beneficial than  watching the MCap disappear and the website usage is  cheaper than an RNS.

1753 2018-08-15 20:19:09 the big bosses ruled. people were able to sell  literal  snake oil. no public schools. no  public fire  depts. no safety nets. killing native  americans for  fun.
1754 2018-08-15 20:19:03 I love having money right now! Bought a Christmas present for my roommate (real early because money), renewed my license plates, got my oil changed and tires rotated
1755 2018-08-15 20:19:02 [拡散希望]調味料&食材botさん繋がりましょう。みんなを揚げたり絡めたり、ギトギトにしてあげます。
1756 2018-08-15 20:18:45 Finally changed my oil
1757 2018-08-15 20:18:43 Oil companies massively expanded their deepwater drilling operations after the government put a cap on their potential financial liability for the damage done by an oil spill. This led directly to the risks taken at Deepwater Horizon.
1758 2018-08-15 20:18:42 Ah, but no one is disagreeing that the US is not socialist. As far as I can tell it is our majority owned oil and gas which makes us in Norway socialism and, yep, that seems to be a sufficient criteria.
1759 2018-08-15 20:18:39 You have to oil a beard? Oh my god, tell me more. I'll even feed you a cookie.
1760 2018-08-15 20:18:37 While there are plenty of anonymous donations on the page there are over 10,000 individual donations. Most are pretty small but there are a few larger ones (I saw a $500 one). But that means the average donation is about $40. Likely it's just RESIST idiots making him rich.
1761 2018-08-15 20:18:37 Of course, it is a myth. The extreme  poverty in Nigeria is not caused by the fall of crude oil price. Rather, it's caused by looting that you and your likes did. When leaders pillaged, their people will really suffered.
1762 2018-08-15 20:18:34 I want some oil but refuse to leave my house so
1763 2018-08-15 20:18:34 Their lord ass-burglar the magnificent painted in holy oil slithered into their panty hamster
1764 2018-08-15 20:18:26 So guess which idiot didn’t screw the lid on the engine oil bottle and left it to roll around in my boot... YEP ME!!
1765 2018-08-15 20:18:06 Survival for KSA.  Placate Trump for a strong arm against Iran.  China caught the hook and dropped imports, pricing followed.  Whether it be opaque China inventories or Middle East onshore inventories the deficit continues.  Real question is does anyone else want US shale oil?
1766 2018-08-15 20:18:02 He can take his embassy and kiss our oil rich African Black a*s. 
If not that our leaders don't have sense.. Nah US For Rush Us
1767 2018-08-15 20:17:32 The taste is NOT the same as oil frying. I personally dont care for them.
1768 2018-08-15 20:17:23 Cut them in quarters, a little coconut oil, salt, and pepper, and then I roast those beauties in the oven! Maybe a squeeze of lemon over them when they’re done. 
1769 2018-08-15 20:17:17 But thats my point.. State own enterprise managing a state own enterprise.Canada is a free market.. No state owned. Thats the difference. If your argument is to increase royalties to match state own companies levels, then maybe we should argue we need a state owned oil company
1770 2018-08-15 20:17:16 Awh! I hope so too but I’m actually going to buy oil color materials so I can start making paintings! So it’ll be one small step lol
1771 2018-08-15 20:17:08 Fresh Oil

1777 2018-08-15 20:16:29 Also, there's no guarantee that the dirty oil money is American since most of the big oil companies are multi-nationals.
1778 2018-08-15 20:16:26 How does that make any sense? We should be using Alberta oil and gas! Its stupid we produce it, we should use it!!
1779 2018-08-15 20:16:23 I don’t think this guy gets what being a “snake oil salesman” means. Like at all.

Let's see june 2004-june 2011 inr 46 , to 45 . forgot to add global crisis n oil $145 n yup int rate at 8.5%
June 2011 - may 2014 inr  45-60
forgot to mention oil $100-120 3 yrs int rate slashed to spur growth ( 2013 hiked again) 5 yrs of nrega
Who's better
1784 2018-08-15 20:16:11 Sliced with a pinch of salt and olive oil.... that paired with bread and a nice wine... perfect.
1785 2018-08-15 20:16:10 Lmao I sent the oil one to Kelli
1786 2018-08-15 20:15:46 Blend 11 lbs chocolate with 2 quarts cheese. Mix into  Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve on a bed of pasta
1787 2018-08-15 20:15:34 I had never been to the Gulf until the oil spill. I demanded we go to Sanibel because I was sure it would be ruined for decades to come. (Yeah, I suck at geography.) #FOMO

Returned to Sanibel or Captiva every summer after that until kids got summer jobs in ‘16.
Maybe 2 in Oct?
1788 2018-08-15 20:15:15 Some have landed estates or jewels or a crest bestowed by a king. My family’s most coveted possession is a 5’x5’ oil painting of a swiss cake roll. Every cousin wants that masterpiece. Who, in the end, will be the victor?

1796 2018-08-15 20:14:04 and a fracking, big oil funded party that has the audacity to pretend to care about the environment.

1800 2018-08-15 20:13:43 Reading KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON about the mass murder of wealthy Osage Indians in the 1920’s. The bizarre and horrific lengths white people went to to grab a portion of Osage oil wealth is chilling. The tribe was under seige by white people who claimed to be their friends.
1801 2018-08-15 20:13:39 #careSHAREgrow olive oil is so good for your skin!
1802 2018-08-15 20:13:35 I take that back. The 2017 and '18 Civics take synthetic oil like my car. It's more expensive than an average oil change.
1803 2018-08-15 20:13:23 You are right and especially when an oil producing state like bayelsa has a senator that only tweet and blackmail. The same state that PDP has ruled for 16 years is ranking the first in terms of poverty in nigeria
1804 2018-08-15 20:13:09 Party trying to shut down a drugs factory. Victorian style child labour stuff. I ask the DM if there's an oil around. He says yes, our Barbarian instinctively throws it at some machinery. I cast Fireball, blow up building, KO myself and all but one of our party.
1805 2018-08-15 20:13:08 #AAOG market can’t see it yet, but they are going through an existing, producing horizon, there WILL be oil, once we get oil shows that’ll get market whipped up for Mengo and Djeno, ohh and then there’s Vanji  ohhhh and TLP104, huge potential on offer...

Trudeau wish’s to destroy the west’s economy,has more or less! Singh would import other oil instead of burning our own?

1812 2018-08-15 20:12:18 Hey, I’m from the region of Spain were aioli is. It’s not mayo, it’s a really hard to cook sauce make with garlic and olive oil. In other countries some chefs use mayo as a base and call the sauce “aioli”, but that’s an atrocity similar to what some people try to pass as Paella.
1813 2018-08-15 20:12:12 why are y’all not sending us full sized items? this primer is travel sized. also, why the heck would you send a repeat item? i’ve gotten the nail cuticle oil in a box before. i’m annoyed and cancelling my subscription
1814 2018-08-15 20:12:00 Hello. There are a few things you could try. A mix of vegetable oil and vinegar applied sparingly with a soft cloth then buffed dry should work. Remove any dust first.

1818 2018-08-15 20:11:25 Furthermore, as an economist, I would say you seem to cherry pick the countries. What about the USA, France, Spain, Russia, GB and other countries that dont have state own oil companies ? I would love to see a full picture rather than an upward skewed picture.

1822 2018-08-15 20:10:35 Not true. Corporations can summon the power of government at any time. Our military spends billions protecting oil shiplanes. Thousands have died protecting oil fields.

1824 2018-08-15 20:10:30 I heard Paul Begala, Joan Walsh, and two other people talking on the radio one time about how amazing it was that they paid so little or nothing for college. Begala attributed his to Texas sitting on an ocean of oil.

1830 2018-08-15 20:10:04 Went outside for just about 5 min. To eat a little lunch, I was swarmed by bees, bit by a dear fly above my eye, bit by a mosquito on my wrist.  Give me a break mother nature.  Guess what?  I've got an oil for that.....
1831 2018-08-15 20:09:51 You don't have to own or install solar on your residence. There is community solar/wind, power purchase agreements, etc.

Getting off coal means rate payers pressuring producers to make the change. Burning oil in ICE cars exerts NO pressure on coal power plants.

Pro tips - marinade chicken in corn flour/soy sauce, add the garlic & ginger into the frying pan first, don’t use olive oil (not Asian!)
1836 2018-08-15 20:09:27 I grew up in South Africa, as it happens, and have always found it almost impossible to discuss the real world with people who insist on categorising the world on the basis of simplistic binary criteria. But if I have understood you correctly: if we did not have oil or gas

1840 2018-08-15 20:09:01 What a silly article. The criticism from Elon and most clean energy advocates of the oil industry was in their lobbying to block climate solutions and not investing in clean tech deployment. If Saudi reverses course, then we clean energy advocates have won a major battle.

1846 2018-08-15 20:08:14 We have also committed to sourcing 100% certified palm oil (Tesco own-brand products) as a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). I hope this helps. Best Wishes, Si 2/2
1847 2018-08-15 20:07:53 Yesterday’s marketing workshop with Integrated Safety Support reminded us of how important it is to have a safe work environment. Their work in transport, aviation and oil and gas is lifesaving! @integratedsafe #sleepdoctor #safety
1848 2018-08-15 20:07:51 Stupidity can be liberating for stupids as they have no conscious to challenge them when telling a lie & stealing. But in the long-run stupidity harms the most the stupid person because as the going gets rough the puppet masters will dump them in boiling oil like potato wedges.
1849 2018-08-15 20:06:55 I definitely don’t want to eat Sri Lankan/Maldivian food for a while; after two weeks on a holiday the taste of coconut oil was overwhelming, curry for breakfast was too much and there was a lot of tuna... LIKE TWICE A DAY.
1850 2018-08-15 20:06:55 Sooo when the oil pipeline that crosses Iowa from NWcorner to SW corner bursts, contaminating all the pigs & corn produced, we should just tell them to call King of the IA04 their kind of guy. Works for me PS I don't eat pig or corn

1855 2018-08-15 20:06:27 I need a oil change
1856 2018-08-15 20:06:24 I had 2 men ask me if I needed help changing the oil in my car, which is nice and all but would you ask a man that?? I know how to change my oil, thank you. I’d ask for help if I needed it.
1857 2018-08-15 20:06:08 Hi George. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
1858 2018-08-15 20:05:31 That’s  cool - did you or do you work in an oil refinery you mean ? 
1859 2018-08-15 20:05:27 Ok...try this one.....you would give a paracetamol a headache.
1860 2018-08-15 20:05:16 Hi Daniel, according to our policy Tesco is committed to zero-net deforestation in our sourcing of palm oil. As members of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) we have committed to achieve this by 2020. 1/2
1861 2018-08-15 20:05:03 Why is #fuel up by 10%+ this year, yet oil up by only 2.9% & inflation is 2.4% @TheAA_UK ? Perhaps the @TheRAC_UK might have published opinion on it. Seems opportunistic. Will be interesting to debunk this. Why is #diesel dearer yet less refined? What are they doing @MSE_Deals
1862 2018-08-15 20:04:39 GOOD argument. The Arabs are being lied to (It's about the oil / oil and gas pipelines). The Muslims are constantly indoctrinated with hate for the Jews, they have been screaming "kill the Jews, annihilate Israel" since 1949. Jerusalem pogroms?
1863 2018-08-15 20:04:37 pls i missed my interview today and have to change my oil :(
1864 2018-08-15 20:04:17 Stop buying any bread, biscuits, Danish pastries, puddings from Tesco  unless it’s organic then it doesn’t have palm oil.
1865 2018-08-15 20:04:17 Gave my thighs second degree burns by accidentally spilling a bowl of boiling water with eucalyptus oil in it on them while doing a steam inhalation for my sinuses at 5am after a boogie gig.
1866 2018-08-15 20:04:12 Coconut oil got my skin so soft 
1867 2018-08-15 20:04:10 ... ant the other extreme is of course "saint" @jeremycorbyn pet-favourite #Venezuela which has somehow managed to turn the country with the world's largest oil reserves into a basket case with starving people. It makes one weep.
1868 2018-08-15 20:03:46 oh no i know dem feels <3 coconut alone didn't help my scales much but soaking in apple cider vinegar then applying coconut oil made a decent-ish difference

1889 2018-08-15 20:01:28 Could also add in the Greek solders that was being held. Or the invasion of Syria and support of ISIS/FSA both Islamic terror groups. Greece wants to build oil or gas within its waters. Troubled futures.
1890 2018-08-15 20:01:28 823 a month not including insurance. Plus repairs/oil changes. Not worth it. Unless you REALLY got it like that. I wouldn’t do it. Cars lose value everyday.

1892 2018-08-15 20:01:09 And you’re going to tell me that all this increased heat and no rain and drought conditions has no affect on fires. And I suppose you’re also going to tell me there’s no proof that burning oil doesn’t cause climate change.
1893 2018-08-15 20:01:06 #OrangutanJungleSchool In a messed up world of brexit and Trump the orangutans were epic, their handlers inspirational. Now stop with the palm oil plantations.
1894 2018-08-15 20:00:44 You are absolutely right. Just giant steam engines. Instead of coal or oil or gas to boil the water we use nuclear energy from splitting U235 atoms. The rest is pretty much the same. Sure I will get an ear bashing from the technical crowd. But you are correct-great big kettles.

1899 2018-08-15 20:00:23 Ok, let’s reverse it small. If you say Bukky can’t do 7% like I suggest - assume oil prices are stable around $70, what kind of policies do you think a putative President Bukky will push that will *stop* the economy growing?
1900 2018-08-15 20:00:18 Many people don't know that the Paris Accord had the US ham strung. It did not allow us to explore for oil, gas, or coal, build more refineries, coal plants on OUR OWN soil. Mean while China & the EU & UK were unrestrained for the same. We're already the "greenest" on the planet

1909 2018-08-15 19:59:29 That was an error - memory let me down there - should have checked. Oil & gas is a positive - the price will go up eventually - just got to ensure oil companies pick up decom costs. You have witten/pasted screeds yet still not answered the original question.

1941 2018-08-15 19:55:50 rub it into your scalp for 5-10 mins before shampooing (: I also add coconut oil & tea tree
1942 2018-08-15 19:55:43 I feel I have to go and read up on actual snake oil salesmen. I keep using the term but I'm increasingly concerned I may be maligning snake oil salesmen who maybe don't deserve the comparison with modern internet nazis.
1943 2018-08-15 19:55:40 Why on earth did I schedule an oil change at 3:30? That’s prime napping time. Can y’all check my head too? Throw it on the bill
1944 2018-08-15 19:55:28 Gotta get a oil change lol
1945 2018-08-15 19:55:26 Just put 1tbsp oil in a pan, 1/2 cup corn, cover and cook till all have popped

1948 2018-08-15 19:55:16 So the other I was making tacos and while I was putting the tortilla in the oil it splashed and a drop hit my leg  now I have a brown burn mark and it looks like a birthmark
1949 2018-08-15 19:55:14 no our dollar was at the same price 1 USD to 1CAD thats why a lot of people went to the states for shopping before the oil prices dove down etc etc
1950 2018-08-15 19:55:13 Try a less irritating oil but one that still penetrates. Avocado is great in hair. Maybe try and & a coconut up combo
1951 2018-08-15 19:55:04 Not quite that easy....all the plastic and carbon fibre is made from oil and gas.......I worry about not having plastics......Also where do you get your electricity in the winter when it's dark in Alaska?
1952 2018-08-15 19:55:02 @delallofoods Is it normal for your extra virgin avocado oil to have a very strong smell?
1953 2018-08-15 19:54:59 @VoteHafner, kindly explain your plan for immediate funding of Alaska's education and medicaid programs without oil revenue. Further, please describe Alaska's post-oil economy, quantifying jobs & payroll, and the policies which will get us there.
1954 2018-08-15 19:54:41 How about you take off the slippers and nylons, place those beautiful feet on my lap so I can give them a nice relaxing massage. Using that coconut oil you like, of course.

1962 2018-08-15 19:54:01 @DawnDish you do so much good for the country's oil disasters. It is the reason I buy your product. But I can't stand by and watch you support hatred. I will not buy Dawn until you have a change of priorities.
1963 2018-08-15 19:53:47 So the simple decision of not allowing oil and gas to be wholly privately owned also means we are automatically socialist? If we had stuck to fish and forestry, but had the same policy we would automatically not be socialist (as the sovereign wealth fund would be much smaller)
1964 2018-08-15 19:53:46 We did some work to compare these rates to other countries in the story and there are two graphs you might be interested in seeing that show revenues vs royalties and how Canada compares to some other major oil producing nations.
1965 2018-08-15 19:53:32 Is it just me or 
Does everyone love the Smell of castor oil
1966 2018-08-15 19:53:16 i’ve been doing really well with taking my fish oil and multivitamins

1968 2018-08-15 19:52:58 At my age I'm toking a little, but mainly use cannabis oil to relieve the chronic pain.
1969 2018-08-15 19:52:52 Tax the oil producers. Put a heavy burden on oil producers to come up with an alternative energy source.
1970 2018-08-15 19:52:48 I just got my oil changed and car washed for free 
1971 2018-08-15 19:52:37 Yes please! How did you make it? I LOVE popping kernels at home, on the hob with a little oil and salt and cayenne pepper. But sometimes it’s not fluffy enough, and I end up loosing a filling 
1972 2018-08-15 19:52:33 is oil water but like, extra thicc

1981 2018-08-15 19:51:22 Not really sure, but I thing I should fist peel that nylon off your right leg. And then oil up those sexy feet. Do you like the idea?
1982 2018-08-15 19:51:15 @OldDutchFoodsUS  I’d like to know what happened to your Dutch Crunch Original. All summer they have tasted like 5 day old burnt French Fries cooked in bad oil. Is this on purpose. I thought maybe it was a bad batch. These are horrible. New and Unimproved?
1983 2018-08-15 19:51:09 Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA will start using the local cryptocurrency El Petro for all its transactions on August 20, 

From August 20, the petro will begin to be used in parallel with the national currency the bolivar, and its prices will be pegged to the bolivar
1984 2018-08-15 19:50:59 You're comparing a develop country with underdeveloped country, better still, comparing a country with much diversity with a country that are solely relying on oil as source of income is a very bad ideology.
1985 2018-08-15 19:50:45 LOL - the IMF long pre-dated oil price increases by decades. Which tract did you take the rest of your deluded maunderings out of?
1986 2018-08-15 19:50:33 Eight counties in the Panhandle all wound up with oil on their beaches -- and all 8 depend on tourism & the military for their economy. Neither of those industries support drilling near #Florida.
1987 2018-08-15 19:50:30 I still taste motor oil every time I drink tea
1988 2018-08-15 19:50:26 Profitability may not be all-important for QF in this case. Oil prices in future will decide whether or not ULH flights will survive.
1989 2018-08-15 19:50:13 or Venezuela vs Dubai ... the first have more oil than the last 
1990 2018-08-15 19:50:10 Checking my shampoo for palm oil on @proctorgamble website - they have a link to their efforts with palm oil on that page. It leads to an error page. Not reassuring #OrangutanJungleSchool
1991 2018-08-15 19:50:03 The leadership there is they don t have any negative emotions come up with oil and what might still happen.
1992 2018-08-15 19:49:43 Oh why did we not talk about olive oil queen Lesia Tuskeron en la casa de @rfsatar ? There has to be a next time.
1993 2018-08-15 19:49:41 Missy, we respect your decision to no longer support us. We believe that it's not what you grow, but how you grow it that matters (ex. conventionally grown coconut oil is more destructive to people-planet-animals than 3rd-party certified organic & fair trade palm oil). -Stacey

1996 2018-08-15 19:49:12 today i successfully got a sample of my dog's poop (for the vet) before he ate it, confidently told the receptionist at the vet that i was "here to drop off some poop", and then Woman'd my way out of paying for a $12 oil change
1997 2018-08-15 19:48:44 I feel like y’all oil field workers today. Been in the truck damn near all day, only get out about every 2 hours for about 30 minutes
1998 2018-08-15 19:48:42 I hate when I take my car to get an oil change and then the people are telling me it needs all these other services and I’m just thinking like even if it really did, does it look like I have $500 to cover everything you’re telling me lol
1999 2018-08-15 19:48:33 Too much fat in the diet can cause pancreatitis, Rocket got it once and it was because I put too much fish oil in his food, have your bro feed a better diet if possible, especially lower in fats.
2000 2018-08-15 19:48:27 UGH I WISH I COULD TAKE YOU W ME BUT I SAW TICKET PRICES AND AAID “yikes do i want to get an oil change and change my tires or go to this thing” dbdjdjkdndks

2002 2018-08-15 19:48:21 Figured out how the Muvluv Alternative world can be saved. Just tell the Americans every BETA hive has oil in it. They go crazy for that shit and wouldn't let anything stand in their way.
2003 2018-08-15 19:47:57 Who likes lower oil? Airliners.
2004 2018-08-15 19:47:52 Thank you  what is the oil in here?
2005 2018-08-15 19:47:48 what pisses me off more than anything is when someone asks “is this the Strickland oil company” RIGHT AFTER I ANSWER “STRICKLAND OIL” LIKE ARE YOU FREAKING STUPID MY GOD
2006 2018-08-15 19:47:42 Current "oil revenue" model is completely misnamed - it's an industry specific corporation tax on profits and powerful international companies have many ways and means to minimise this
2007 2018-08-15 19:47:25 sometimes cooking is sticking your finger straight into hot oil and that's okay
2008 2018-08-15 19:47:23 Well good for them. Yet someone like me...lower middle class ....work my butt off at a school as an admin secretary. I get nothing. Just higher insurance premiums..higher food and gas/oil prices. And higher priced milk..lobster(live in Maine) higher elec. Costs.
2009 2018-08-15 19:47:18 Ever get tea tree oil in your eye? Wouldn’t wish that pain on even my worst enemy..
2010 2018-08-15 19:47:13 Pour some olive oil into it and stand up tall preferably on a pair of step ladders then place your left hand over your left ear & pinch your nose tight with your right hand , hold your breath , lift your left leg & close both eyes now at this point you must..

2017 2018-08-15 19:46:38 Oh! Oil or melted butter based cakes freeze better than ones where you cream the butter and sugar first. Liquid fat coats all those little granules and keeps things moist and tender.
2018 2018-08-15 19:46:37 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
2019 2018-08-15 19:46:31 Am sure you know dat is typographical error, u capitalize on it bcos dat is part of ur calling. Tell me how much u invested in education wen u are part of government? Bcos I know ur guys were borrow to pay salaries and still many state could not pay despite d price of crude oil.
2020 2018-08-15 19:46:14 How much do oil changes usually cost ?
2021 2018-08-15 19:46:07 WHAT!!!!, oil prices have dropped, gasoline  prices have dropped on stock market! Another example of foreign Big Oil screwing consumers!
2022 2018-08-15 19:45:58 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
2023 2018-08-15 19:45:45 Jaffa, not being an oil man (and never claiming to be) I will ask the question, what is it? I mean I hope that it’s the new enlarged pump, if it is how many bopd can this deliver, sorry that’s if it’s the pump.....
2024 2018-08-15 19:45:44 More oil than only other country, and broke as hell. Crazy
2025 2018-08-15 19:45:37 @LesserEvilSnack I'm so bummed... I opened a bag of #buddabowlpopcorn coconut oil and it's burnt :-(
2026 2018-08-15 19:45:36 Great question! The variety of green heirloom tomatoes you received are actually ripe, so they would be delicious to eat raw in a salad!
We also recommend sprinkling some salt & pepper, and drizzling a bit of olive oil over a few slices for a quick, fresh meal :)
2027 2018-08-15 19:45:33 It's not oil; it's Iran and the threat of a nuclear arms race in the volitile Middle East.
Dems say they want Trump to stand up to Russia... well, there ya go.
2028 2018-08-15 19:45:30 The clue is “billionaire”. This is where a lot of the oil money went. Into his pockets.
2029 2018-08-15 19:45:28 We must focus to the great business only,justlike petroleum,oil palm,rubber,hotel,houses,food, electronic asset,electric asset whatever.The government of pakatan harapan cant disturb or sabotage because we just wanted to business & upgrade the economic together only..

2038 2018-08-15 19:44:50 You must be like @Dylan_YYC OR use the secret  formula!  Coconut oil!  Mind you I've been using it for 37 ofd yeard but …
2039 2018-08-15 19:44:37 All I will say is the squeaky wheel does get the oil. More in a bit but phone calls to family first.
2040 2018-08-15 19:44:04 Unfortunately JMD has snake oil salesmen whispering in his ear. Very disappointing.
2041 2018-08-15 19:44:03 Pop, pop, head explodes.  He'll be crying over at CNN. Playing Roy Orbison.
2042 2018-08-15 19:44:03 Embarrassing. Like Chorley’s a fucking oil painting!
2043 2018-08-15 19:43:42 Hey Daniel, substituting palm oil with other oil crops could simply shift the environmental burden elsewhere and would have significant negative consequences for those communities which grow and rely on palm oil for their livelihoods. 1/2
2044 2018-08-15 19:43:41 Lebron didn’t join the team that won the finals 2 out of 3 years. You can’t defend KD. Stop being a snake oil salesman
2045 2018-08-15 19:43:40 War can't begin until there's been sufficient catch up though, that's my point. China's earliest date for the beginning of their project is 2030. WWI didn't take place until 10-30 years after many of the innovations necessary for it (from oil ships to flights to etc.)
2046 2018-08-15 19:43:40 Sitting to wait to get an oil change blows me
2047 2018-08-15 19:43:39 The 405 alone carries 380,000 cars per day. Total freeway mileage per year approaches 100 billion. But, yeah, California, screw oil.
2048 2018-08-15 19:43:30 The sell back is what I refer to as tariff. It’s not a tax break, that’s what the oil and gas industry get. Renewables added £50 per year to homeowner bills, oil and gas add £450.

2051 2018-08-15 19:43:01 Ah so using the separatist own assets theory actually Scotland owes trillions of & oil money to rUK then. And have to repay 90% of revenue claimed geographically.
2052 2018-08-15 19:42:53 I successfully changed my own oil for the first time
2053 2018-08-15 19:42:48 I’m bout to get an oil change then my sis havin a birthday dinner
2054 2018-08-15 19:42:42 The point is that of course the elite class demonizes taxes and unions.  It not only cuts into their profit margins, but it hinders their ability to have complete control. Then they sell us a bunch of snake oil that’s it’s about fairness and we end up doing their bidding for them
2055 2018-08-15 19:42:39 Where’s GREEN PEACE ??? And you worry about OIL !???
2056 2018-08-15 19:42:38 gotta be this new hair oil I’m using..
2057 2018-08-15 19:42:31 Thanks Stacey, but many cos are buying from other cos who are making false claims abt the origins of their #palmoil 
I buy no products that use palm oil, no matter the claims of sustainability. I bought @DrBronner for over 25 yrs, but no more. I've moved to small indpt producers
2058 2018-08-15 19:42:28 J. Cole do look like he smell a little tangy.

Not full on musty, but like the beginning stages...clouded by whatever essential oil he got on for the day.

2062 2018-08-15 19:42:12 What about in snake oil?
2063 2018-08-15 19:42:07 Must have been reading fake news because he had to be shamed into it and that after lying that the church was flooded. This guy is a snake oil salesman lining his pockets off of contributors like you.
2064 2018-08-15 19:42:01 Not sure what other people do - I just winged it one night and make it mostly the same way ever since. I start with a hot pan, put in a little bit of sesame oil til it heats up, then scramble eggs in the oil. When they're fully cooked, add rice and soy sauce, mix, fry
2065 2018-08-15 19:41:42 No bens here . Only an offer the bod believes to be suitable will be put in front of shareholders egm possible if no outcome from sr we are closer to the end ... hold on sure I heard that before...where’s that oil desktop study  none of my questions answered

2075 2018-08-15 19:40:31 “Turkey has classic vulnerabilities” Bloomberg and Turkey needs a ton of oil. Who’s will Turkey turn to, what does that say about “our” economic advisers who left the discussions with Turkey go on. Are we following up on global economic events???
2076 2018-08-15 19:40:24 Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) export oil from Kirkuk fields in northern Iraq via Turkey, around 300,000 bpd have been shut in since the Iraqi federal government moved in last October to take control over the oil fields in Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.
2077 2018-08-15 19:40:17 I never let my oil percentage get to 5% but this time i did I just never had time to get the oil changed...
2078 2018-08-15 19:40:15 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
2079 2018-08-15 19:40:04 ９月９日に行きますぅ！
2080 2018-08-15 19:40:02 Sadly. Until we get governments that will actually work to reduce emissions and fight oil/carbon use, allaying the burning world will be part of of our daily lives.
2081 2018-08-15 19:39:53 The Thai restaurant on the ground floor of my office building is making chili-garlic oil that smells like heaven. I just pressed my face against the air vent in the hallway, like a lady.
2082 2018-08-15 19:39:43 Ohhh it was Rusty’s! I was right!
2083 2018-08-15 19:39:43 ~carefully hides deep fryer oil, cornmeal, and buttermilk~ Yup, our friends. Definitely not for breading and frying to a delicious golden brown.
2084 2018-08-15 19:39:39 They don’t like peppermint oil. Soaking some cotton wool and placing nearby might encourage them to move on? It works for ants too! 
2085 2018-08-15 19:39:28 @GMC @chevrolet I have a 2013 GMC Terrian. Consuming oil and rings had to be replaced at 55,000 miles 
On going problem with these engines. Do the right thing! Help!
2086 2018-08-15 19:39:09 Saw the trailer for that. Hoped they’d have a go at the palm oil industry creating the problem.
2087 2018-08-15 19:39:02 We take a lot of grads from Eire who presumably don't have PGCE.  Also there is retraining scheme (DLITE) where local ex Oil workers and Council staff are retrained in 18 months tho none of the former survived to the end.  My advice is ask again - we r getting desperate /c
2088 2018-08-15 19:38:53 You'll see more baby oil then sweat.
2089 2018-08-15 19:38:42 So let's just add offshore oil drilling to the mix.
Nothing could go wrong...

2091 2018-08-15 19:38:37 I agree that changes are needed -- but we shouldn't come up with silly ideas for change's sake alone.  The core issue is that we have industries that must corrupt the public interest to thrive:
Oil
Big Pharma
Insurance
Guns
Banks (Credit)
among others
2092 2018-08-15 19:38:24 Oil change?
2093 2018-08-15 19:38:23 
2094 2018-08-15 19:38:04 Well the guy changing my oil said I smell good so I guess that’s always a positive

2098 2018-08-15 19:37:44 I really thought this was for some kind of hash oil extraction for a minute there.
2099 2018-08-15 19:37:40 Sounds sinular to what our left and environmentalist did to our two coastline Pipelines. Chance to get off oversea Oil and our own government axed swnding Alberta into the Red when it was running in the Black.

2104 2018-08-15 19:37:04 Nigeria didn't sell cruise missiles to Saudi Arabia that killed a bus full of children all because they want access to Saudi oil. Just sayin
2105 2018-08-15 19:37:01 So you get your "facts" from oil execs, the government and your gut feeling then? Again facts are facts and you obviously do not have them.
2106 2018-08-15 19:36:45 Heide 'Buzz off' is apparently the message to everyone that either questions why this is continually in price decline or to anyone who asks questions. Such remarks from you speak volumes.
2107 2018-08-15 19:36:44 I’ve head you use very inflammatory language many times. Quite possibly the reason I listened to you. I’ve heard you call people names, incite fights and threaten people. Now I realize your a “punk”. Your insignificant and blocked. Pedal your snake oil to someone else!!!

2111 2018-08-15 19:36:27 When we didn't have lotion/vaseline we'd use holsum or cooking oil.

If its august you are in trouble because all the dust sticks to you and your skin tone changes
#loxionchronicles
2112 2018-08-15 19:36:24 Question is, do you have a glass of oil or cooked with whisky? 
2113 2018-08-15 19:36:20 You can have OIL/Godly Relationship and LIGHT/Knowledge #BestofBothWorlds
2114 2018-08-15 19:36:14 This chimes with a half-remembered story from my Grandfather who was in the RE in Egypt. I think he said they split oil drums lengthways, filled them with water and painted the ground around them to simulate waterways. Far fetched?
2115 2018-08-15 19:36:06 Oh so were now too wee too poor too stupid. Scotland's wealth is al, around you. The only country to discover oil and gas and get poorer. Then there's the brexit dividend........whoop whoop
2116 2018-08-15 19:35:59 No I did not spot any dude rubbing oil in his chest
2117 2018-08-15 19:35:53 Nigerian oil and gas sector is loosing it's exploration investments gradually. Some argue that oil reserves have decreased to about 30 billion barrels. If drastic steps are not taken to shore up reserve replacement, crude oil production might drop in the nearest future.
2118 2018-08-15 19:35:44 it makes your skin ashy af afterwards like damn i know it says oil free but can i get a little moisture??
2119 2018-08-15 19:35:38 We have 5. But over half is woods. So only maintain a little over two. We are two miles from nearest paved road. Drive across neighbor's hay field. You wouldn't believe what changing oil involves. Thinking about hiring a 3-year-old next time. Small hands would help greatly.
2120 2018-08-15 19:35:33 He really showed his true colors, but people are still buying his brand of snake oil.
2121 2018-08-15 19:35:33 Outdoor one for oil cost us 2.5 recently
2122 2018-08-15 19:35:30 Sure, just saying “snake oil” is about as hyperbolic as the early marketing. And reviewers still recognize it’s the best there is, even if it doesn’t reflect the hype.
2123 2018-08-15 19:35:27 Hehehe- True. All roads lead to Russia. And pee pee. And oil.
2124 2018-08-15 19:34:58 “Turkey and Iraq cannot take any steps regarding Kirkuk’s oil export without first reaching an agreement with the Kurdistan Region. The oil pipeline is completely under the control and protection of the Kurdistan Region,”

2128 2018-08-15 19:34:16 Was just about to purchase a new Harmony 650 because the buttons next to the screen were starting to fail... 

As a fluke I decided to take it apart and remove the conductive oil off the button contact... It works fine now...
2129 2018-08-15 19:33:56 Brian is the Connor McGregor of the oil and gas industry. He's only gettin warmed up! 
2130 2018-08-15 19:33:56 This last paragraph summarizes a question we should all ask ourselves as Canadians - are we really ok with buying oil from tyranny states?
2131 2018-08-15 19:33:49 Today at the office, the supervisor spilled oil, and in my absence, the GM asked who spilled the oil, He reported that I did. 

Honestly, I didn't. 
They didn't even want to explain, finally I got suspended. 
2132 2018-08-15 19:33:48 Another victim of western indoctrination. What oil? If the US wanted middle eastern oil they would have kept Kuwait as a colony during the first gulf war which produces 10% of the worlds oil.
2133 2018-08-15 19:33:41 fell into an inspection pit? Burned on a oil diffusion pump? Flicked cyanoacrylate into my eye? Attacked by fundie during repro rights march?
2134 2018-08-15 19:33:28 Wise man...quick to throw around insults...

When we are importing petrol and exporting crude and oil price is low...please, are you the one paying the marketers?
2135 2018-08-15 19:33:18 Im over this oil change already
2136 2018-08-15 19:33:14 I must beat them. I'll never get this oil again. 
2137 2018-08-15 19:33:09 I lovvveeee olive oil bread dip. This recipe is a keeper!
2138 2018-08-15 19:33:02 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
2139 2018-08-15 19:32:54 Groovy new normal for us to get used to, I guess. I’ll remember to thank an oil exec, climate denier and/or a boomer that helped hasten this for us all to enjoy 
2140 2018-08-15 19:32:51 Maybe they are on to something? Perhaps it'll be the next "big thing" like the #TidePodChallenge? Perhaps it's good for their skin? Then my mind circles back to what an incredible waste of food & resources and how many orangutans lost their habitat for the palm oil in that ramen.
2141 2018-08-15 19:32:50 What is worse, however, is the situation of crude oil. It's shameless that the govt kept the excise rates high during price slump and refuses to reduce them now.
2142 2018-08-15 19:32:37 In Angola the state company is Sonangol. Not only do they have the lions share of all the deals with oil majors operating there but they own the helicopter company that fly the crews out to the facilities.

2146 2018-08-15 19:31:44 The army ruined me. Like, I now have a freaking anxiety attack every time anything more than a minor inconvenience happens because i think something terrible is going to happy. Forgetting to get a oil change isn’t going to get anyone killed, but guess who had a Meltdown today.
2147 2018-08-15 19:31:35 Need to go change my oil but my bed so relaxing right now 
2148 2018-08-15 19:31:26 So both #BC and #Quebec hate dirty Alberta oil but are cool with swimming in raw sewage they pump out into the waterways not to mention buying the blood oil from #SouthArabia, now that’s interesting?!  What a great time to be an environmental hypocrite.

2160 2018-08-15 19:30:22 If you want to help #Orangutans check before you buy, if the product contains #PalmOil its highly likely its been produced in a area of deforestation by the Palm Oil industry  that has destroyed Orangutan habitat

2164 2018-08-15 19:30:00 When you sniff an essential oil, the molecules go up through the
"ethmoid plate" at the top of the nose into the circulation of the
brain. Oils are potent when you get them where they need to be. Many
contemporary uses of them waste time and money.

2174 2018-08-15 19:28:56 Was 20k miles over needed to have my something changed in the car ( not the oil ) maybe the #gays can’t drive....
2175 2018-08-15 19:28:55 this level and speed of financial anticipation is unreal! I can't attest to it in oil but see it in other macro news, it's fast, it's frustrating, and I always blame the algos.
2176 2018-08-15 19:28:38 Now my car is completely out of oil somehow. But yesterday it was fine

I swear to God if it's not one thing it's another on my little garbage heap of a car

2184 2018-08-15 19:27:41 What's this man saying?! Have they started paying him to tweet too? This must be a joke. 7% GDP growth by folks who don't know anything beyond sharing oil revenues??
2185 2018-08-15 19:27:35 Say no to palm oil. So grateful for places like this , protecting and helping these amazing animals #OrangutanJungleSchool
2186 2018-08-15 19:27:22 If your toast is dry, hold it under her eyes. I'm sure they'll eventually start weeping extra virgin olive oil.
2187 2018-08-15 19:27:16 I always get oil all over me. I figured that was a clue not to go into surgery
2188 2018-08-15 19:27:16 I can't wait for ones dedicated to Uri Geller, Deepak Chopra & other snake oil salesmen & all around silly people with batshit crazy ideas that no one with a brain should take seriously – I mean important. Excuse me.

2193 2018-08-15 19:26:45 The palm oil industry and illegal logging are the main reason #borneo has lost half its forested areas, the orangutan population has dwindled to less than 60,000 #jungleschool #rangtan #deforestation #live
2194 2018-08-15 19:26:39 Which prices? Obj’s Govt had to contend with reserves depleted by Abdulsalami and crushing debt. Made a policy choice to seek debt relief and pursued it energetically. Dovetailed nicely with rising oil prices. He at least made his own luck
2195 2018-08-15 19:26:33 Getting baby car oil changed and inspection tomorrow then wash her car for her

2198 2018-08-15 19:26:04 Watching the beautiful orangutan jungle school. Both wonderful and heartbreaking and shows these most incredible creatures in the natural habitat they should be within.

2206 2018-08-15 19:24:37 Some oil, rope to wrap. Rub glove generously with oil.  Put ball in plastic bag. Seat it in glove in the pocket. Wrap it tight with rope. Put entire glove in plastic bag. Freezer! For as long as you can.

2209 2018-08-15 19:24:17 Free stuff we can't afford? But we can afford to bomb 8 countries at the same time. We can afford a war that has lasted 17 years. We can afford subsidies for oil companies and Wal-Mart. You seem to find money all the time. Except when it comes to programs citizens need. Liars.
2210 2018-08-15 19:24:05 If we're talking about murder. Lets have a conversation about guns. Or war. How many American lives or foreign lives have been lost  over the Bush oil wars?
Also, Republicans are only opposed to abortion when it isn't their mistress who is pregnant.
Let's talk birth control...too
2211 2018-08-15 19:24:02 I have been painting (ink, oil pastels) on paper ( newsprint) lately, and I now realize that I have also been putting in words, like a Chinese painting. I will send you an example--primitive modern folk art. #blandlyart
2212 2018-08-15 19:23:59 Olive oil drops. then get it syringed. Sorted.
2213 2018-08-15 19:23:58 Not all sugars and fats are obesogenic.  80g of fruit sugar a day won’t make you fat, but 80g of soda a day will.  Same goes for 20g olive oil or whole nuts vs. 20g trans fats.

You’re drawing conclusions from a bird’s-eye view of what you admit to be questionable data.
2214 2018-08-15 19:23:52 Say what you will, all theses @TheDemocrats criminal are great orators -AKA snake oil salesmen!

2218 2018-08-15 19:23:13 Of course it's a fact. Trudeau has adopted all of Harper's worst policies. Saudi deal, CO2 emissions targets, corporate tax cut, TPP, oil pipelines, nuclear ban, electoral reform, fighting FN kids for basic meds. Not to mention secrecy, lack of openness.
2219 2018-08-15 19:23:12 I've been using the #RSO cannabis oil topically on my damaged spine. There is more relief than in 10 years. More relief than opioids. I'm so exhausted. It's like the ghost of the pain is still there.

2225 2018-08-15 19:22:44 I really need to find out more about where my palm oil comes from and actually what it is!!
2226 2018-08-15 19:22:43 SAme . But also some  oil majors, oil services and similar stuff
2227 2018-08-15 19:22:37 More than 1 way to control means of production and distribution than outright government ownership.  An end run to avoid the socialist label?
2228 2018-08-15 19:22:22 I'm not gonna look but why do I think this probably involves coconut oil pulling and a colon cleanse?
2229 2018-08-15 19:22:16 I use beard oil when I'm growing it out super long.

2233 2018-08-15 19:21:42 Fixed and geographic assets are always split geographically. The rUK has no more claim on Scottish oil than Scotland has on Cornish tin. Read the references my paper. We'll continue this conversation once you have.
2234 2018-08-15 19:21:31 i actually tried oil pulling. i kept swallowing the oil by accident and quit after spraying it across my monitor when i got an air bubble

2238 2018-08-15 19:21:08 That "over correction" was the explicit thought that states or regions could never be strong enough to recreate the conditions for Biafra.

Oh and the Oil & Land are ours, signed FGN.
2239 2018-08-15 19:21:06 Am sure this guy doesn't live in Nigeria....Nigeria came out of recession as a result of increase in oil prices not agriculture. Infact Nigeria is on d verge of a food crisis
2240 2018-08-15 19:20:50 Cameron. Olive oil has one of the lowest smoke points.
2241 2018-08-15 19:20:47 I agree...should always match and the chrome (although cheaper) also appears very "cheap". We've always had BN...but our new place is Oil Rubbed Bronze

2243 2018-08-15 19:20:28 Obj’s first term. Prices were very low and we still had growth. Oil prices have been stable for a year (and rising), are you confident of even 3% growth (the govt’s own target) this year?
2244 2018-08-15 19:20:16 I bought some rose oil a few weeks ago and my skin is so flawless now I almost love myself

2256 2018-08-15 19:18:34 Hello friends, I arrived in Raleigh at exactly 1:56 PM and at 2:57 PM, my roommate and I started a fire trying to use olive oil to cook French fries. As you can tell, it’s going to be a great school year 
2257 2018-08-15 19:18:28 You are a liberal.
2258 2018-08-15 19:18:17 it's lovely & everything but truth is this is as a result of PALM OIL & ruthless deforestation of Indonesia by food giants.
2259 2018-08-15 19:18:16 @Kia can I get a free oil change to compensate for what should have taken 5-10 mins to put air in my tires, expanding to 2 hours of being completely forgot about???
2260 2018-08-15 19:18:11 Apply your tea tree oil and be humble
2261 2018-08-15 19:18:11 As much as I’m loving #orangutanJungleSchool and how adorable they are at school, on a serious note if company’s like @pepsi and @MarsGlobal didn’t use palm oil these kids would still have forests and mothers to teach them this. #StopPalmOil
2262 2018-08-15 19:18:06 I’ll never forget when this girl came into my job and was like I think I need an oil change and when I asked the last time she got one she said about a year and a half ago Lmaooooooo
2263 2018-08-15 19:17:51 I mean is it just oil for oil diffusers?
2264 2018-08-15 19:17:49 Selena got a oil change, her tires balanced and a good car wash yesterday. She feeling real undefeated right now.

He cant just manipulate them like how Zanu bought 50 votes with 2kg of rice & 2L cooking oil in my rural homestead
2267 2018-08-15 19:17:29 Oil changes and maintenance are a pain in the ass but I’ll probably never own another car that isn’t a Prius again.

2281 2018-08-15 19:15:13 It used to be the advice to avoid getting a hangover: do a shot of olive oil before you go out. Doesn't work, of course.
2282 2018-08-15 19:15:12 Went and got my oil changed today. And I can’t lie. I really wouldn’t mind having that #LS500L or #LC500 but at the same time I don’t think I deserve it at this moment in my life.
2283 2018-08-15 19:15:10 I burnt both my hands with hot oil good job
2284 2018-08-15 19:15:06 Legalizing pot would be a winner. And show pics of oil birds, fracked mountains, coke piles. Ppl rarely see the ugly side  of growth and fossil fuels.
2285 2018-08-15 19:14:51 I never knew there was a Jamaican black castor oil relaxer. It worked pretty well though and it didn’t burn my scalp. Love

2291 2018-08-15 19:14:29 Oil doesn't go with water.
2292 2018-08-15 19:14:26 I call cultural appropriation in the worst way.
Outside of being a tourist novelty, as a native Texan I have never seen anyone wear these hats, ever.
2293 2018-08-15 19:14:19 Since when is calling someone a “dog” racist?????? Lol people wanna call everything racist. 

I changed my oil today - oh ur racist
2294 2018-08-15 19:14:07 Your argument is we should not sell Canadian oil to other countries nor to other parts of the country.
2295 2018-08-15 19:14:06 We can do much better than oil, natural gas, and coal! Your tweet is penny wise and pound foolish. Long past time to invest heavily in clean, renewable energy.
2296 2018-08-15 19:14:03 —wash your face daily! 
➢use lip scrubs
➢do NOT lick your lips
➢use a lip mask
➢drink a TON of water 
➢wash your face in the morning (get rid of sweat and oil that accumulates overnight) 
 ➢use vitamin e/ almond oil
2297 2018-08-15 19:13:58 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

 It implies that Chavez was a capitalist which is not true

2300 2018-08-15 19:13:38 Drives me potty how they sell arms to the originator of the most evil , horrid Ideology to grace this planet. Barbaric country and the sooner we no longer need their oil the better.
2301 2018-08-15 19:13:26 illegitimate president suppressed freedom of speech today when he  acted on his hit list. Notice that they were all demacrats and the only thing they did was speak out against him. We are another step closer to losing our freedom because of this snake oil salesman.
2302 2018-08-15 19:13:11 I think it's just garlic and salt, with a little sesame oil .
2303 2018-08-15 19:13:08 Ok Duck Dynasty it was always peanut oil. In my 69 years I never heard cooking w gas.
2304 2018-08-15 19:12:45 The big difference is, break standard oil up and you have a bunch of viable oil companies, with marginally higher overheads but otherwise substantially identical. Split Facebook into 5 pieces and it no longer works at all.
2305 2018-08-15 19:12:33 Oil I think will fall big time in dollars. Probably be even in rs terms

2314 2018-08-15 19:11:38 Health? Then you should be more for the environment unless you like a pesticide souffle. Planet before anything or there is nothing. And we do export oil. Duh. Trump of course wants us to stay on oil for his friends even though renewables is the growing job industry.

2324 2018-08-15 19:09:07 But I thought they said palm oil was good. 
Heard it's either you use palm oil, olive oil, or coconut oil
2325 2018-08-15 19:09:01 My momma is back to cooking trashy food again. 
She fries unions with 75% water and 25 % of cooking oil :(
2326 2018-08-15 19:09:00 I just saw a video of a person putting 5 ounces of water and 7 ounces of oil into a jar and explaining that if gravity would exist, the heavier oil would sit on the bottom.

I officially lost all hope in mankind. Just push those big red buttons, maybe the roaches deserve a shot.

2332 2018-08-15 19:08:11 @benmurraybruce   one major factor that causes poverty in Nigeria is lack of Integrity by our political leaders.  Among all the oil producing nations, Nigeria is the only country that lacks good & efficient electricity. Damn! its a big shame

2334 2018-08-15 19:08:02 It's French for the cracks that appear on an oil painting as it drys and becomes rigid with age.

2337 2018-08-15 19:07:49 @SecretaryPerry I appeal to you and your comprehensive oil and gas knowledge to assist in repealing or amending the federal UIC regulations (40 CFR Part 144) and how USDWs are defined. The unrealistic definition is killing the O&G industry, especially here in CA.
2338 2018-08-15 19:07:46 I’m in my zen den..gonna get the oil burner on the go and just kick back n chill the fuck out

2345 2018-08-15 19:06:58 I think you're probably right. The Oil had extreme health in '17 but you should never bank on that.
2346 2018-08-15 19:06:49 im like starving and people are talking about nsfw aechmea oil hang on i need to. make a post about this

2348 2018-08-15 19:06:43 #TuesdayThoughts   Roasters used to all have drip oilers over the bearings and chain. On many of the roasters you used a can to collect the oil then ran it though a strainer so you could reuse it! Food grade grease is a real improvement !

2357 2018-08-15 19:05:20 I’ve found ‘oil’ & ‘massage’ trigger things! Maybe try doing a few really generic roleplays eg. Receptionists, travel agent, caring friend etc and wait to see if those get demonitised and then you’ll know if it’s a particular type of content getting flagged!

2383 2018-08-15 19:02:21 She turns to Pyrodrgn for its input (that she is actually able to understand somehow) when it comes to handling volatile chemicals and fuels. She, in return, gives it the spare oil drums and jerry cans she managed to not eat (but still guzzled the contents of). It needs those.
2384 2018-08-15 19:02:03 The extreme poverty in Nigeria is not caused by the fall of crude oil prices. That is a myth. The reason we overtook the world headquarters for extremely rich legislators is because we suffer from poverty of NASS leadership. When NASS leaders think poorly,people will see poverty!
2385 2018-08-15 19:01:57 Pro traveler tip - always carry something you can dab directly under your nose (e.g. scented lotion, essential oil, Vick's - anything with a highly concentrated smell that you don't hate.) They use this trick in hair salons to diffuse chemical smells.
2386 2018-08-15 19:01:55 I read it...and I think he's subscribing to the Rockefeller philosophy, big time. Just like Bill Gates was. Only problem in my opinion is that in JD's case it was oil which is a commodity, monopoly worked, now in this case, tech & innovation, monopoly will kill you

2392 2018-08-15 19:01:29 Yes, Canada should pump it's oil. So should the Saudi's.  Abundant oil can help lift the world's poor out of poverty. But artificially demonizing long carbon chains from some countries and not others, is magical thinking, bad economics and geo-political dice tossing.

2413 2018-08-15 18:59:56 I got mad OCD, I'll probably take your car to get a oil change while you're sleep or something if I see that oil light 
2414 2018-08-15 18:59:55 On my way!!!!!
2415 2018-08-15 18:59:40 Without oil. Nice
2416 2018-08-15 18:59:30 I would agree with that to a point but again, where are these better options. Same could be said about Caggiula and all of these have to do with roster construction. Also, let's not kid ourselves, the Lucic angle comes directly from the GM as well. ,
2417 2018-08-15 18:59:26 The extreme poverty in Nigeria is not caused by the fall of crude oil prices. That is a myth. The reason we overtook India as the world headquarters for extreme poverty is because we suffer from poverty of leadership. When leaders think poorly, their people will see poverty!

2421 2018-08-15 18:58:28 I'm a third generation rancher. We earn our living off the land. We also have oil wells, gas wells and pipelines on our land. Some of the wells are 60 years old. Never had a problem with the oil companies
2422 2018-08-15 18:58:27 2. Ecuador hardly has this same luxury. Saudi Arabia simply won't respond to public pressure, so no point to protest cause no impact. Moreover, we're destroying forests to get AB oil out of the ground, so the net CO2e impact is v high in AB if you account for land use change.
2423 2018-08-15 18:58:26 Nothing more gratifying than helping people in need. 
As a kid we were a welfare family & Salvation Army put oil for our furnace. I never forget that. When you have extra - give it to someone with little.
2424 2018-08-15 18:58:06 B.C doesn't want our dirty oil to go through their province but they think nothing about pushing their smoke our way! 
2425 2018-08-15 18:57:53 Messed my shoulder up for a solid month by simply reaching for a bottle of oil on the top shelf in the kitchen. The dumbest injury of all, though, was getting headbutted by a dog, resulting in 2 black eyes.

2427 2018-08-15 18:57:48 Well I have a suggestion. Let’s start with those liberal states like CA and see how willing they are to give up oil and coal products. Instead of demanding the whole country go dark by outlawing their use start on a small scale first and then increase their use

2434 2018-08-15 18:57:12 Inslee is leading the way on furthering the local consumption of misery oil from Russia. While others sanction Putin’s Crimea, UK assassination and fake news “accomplishments”, your friend encourages them while attacking cleaner, ethical Canadian energy.
2435 2018-08-15 18:57:10 Like, eating certain foods have negative effects on me. Freakin, vegetable oil makes me fatigued! And I don't like it. I just found out but I'm avoiding it like a marriage proposal.
2436 2018-08-15 18:57:03 I ageee with Saudi Arabia. Control the oil. Control everything. They’re seemingly in bed with everyone. But let’s also not make Al Qaeda free of guilt either. Boundaries are definitively very gray throughout the Middle East

2445 2018-08-15 18:54:44 Used to skin. deseed mine before freezing. Last 7 years, I don't bother, just cut in half, drizzle with olive oil and slow roast in oven, then bottle and freeze. Defrost in microwave, add whichever herb and seasonings I choose then reheat or whatever. Skins are no longer tough.
2446 2018-08-15 18:54:17 I agree they are
But face oil is no bueno
2447 2018-08-15 18:54:12 I have one, it’s still oil change after brakes after replacing tires and wondering what that noise was... it’s stressful and annoying
2448 2018-08-15 18:54:03 Does pipelines and offshore drilling not include oil? Because isn't that fossil fuel? Ir depends on what renewable energy you mean. I think more people should be supporting nuclear. We should all but do away with the notion of relying on wind and solar.
2449 2018-08-15 18:54:03 So yummy, I'm an old soul who likes classic mac n cheese.  People need to stop trying to modify it.  My mac N cheese does not need lobster, truffle oil or gold leafing, get outta my kitchen with that nonsense.

2452 2018-08-15 18:53:48 Most of our oil is imported from OPEC countries who are not in EU. We used to import lots from Norway but percentage wise that’s fallen year on year so we should be fine.
2453 2018-08-15 18:53:43 Well and Norway for example has MASSIVE oil reserves... also like Canada which we should be tapping as well... but that’s another story.

2460 2018-08-15 18:53:11 It’s seems when steel producing countries that have poor environmental, human rights standards dump their low cost product into  there are talks of tariffs and retaliation. Yet we import oil from countries that do the same thing and nothing is said or done about it.

2478 2018-08-15 18:51:33 Wow, i really forgot to get more body oil 
Distracted by this dern makeup lmao
2479 2018-08-15 18:51:25 Teaching my son how to care for his hair. Just adding a moisturizer & oil to his regimen. His curls are poppin & he's a cowash addict.
2480 2018-08-15 18:51:11 The Tarrifs are working. CNN doesn't report on it.
E.U. agreed to work toward zero Tarrifs, China dropped 25% terrifs on oil. 
It is working our economy is strong and getting stronger.
2481 2018-08-15 18:51:07 Greed which is all this can be is a disease and the only cure is a tablespoonful of castor oil for supper , one after breakfast and one after tea,
2482 2018-08-15 18:51:03 Butter! Avocado! Hummus! Chutney! Even just a bit of olive oil! Mayonnaise is VILE.
2483 2018-08-15 18:50:46 What does Jared Kushner have that John Brennan doesn't have?

A. A criminal father
B. A track record as a slumlord
C. A bad habit of entering into shady quid pro quos with oil nations
D. A wife that supports her father's treachery
E. A max security clearance

A: Still A-D only
2484 2018-08-15 18:50:38 I am torn do I start writing story’s? A pretend diary or essential oil recipes? Sounds like I need more books.

2486 2018-08-15 18:50:36 Awesome
2487 2018-08-15 18:50:27 Been needing a oil change for like 2 months 
2488 2018-08-15 18:50:27 And so many revenue out Oil Production.. Shame on Nigeria politicians for preferring to increase the size of their own pockets instead of the well-being of their people. They could set an example for African prosperity but prefer not, shameful
2489 2018-08-15 18:50:16 I was gonna ask if the egg yolk is the yellow part or the white and what is vegetable oil but let me stay in my lane and go and buy cake rather.

2494 2018-08-15 18:49:41 Counter-hot take:  save for a few small, non-corrupt, non-crazy middle eastern states/peoples (Qatar, Jordan, the Kurds) we should have no involvement in the region.  If China wants to jump in that dogpile of crazy, let them.  Plenty of oil to be had in TX, ND, AK, Canada...
2495 2018-08-15 18:49:35 I didn’t get any I went with Fish Oil instead :(
2496 2018-08-15 18:49:35 Try chewing aloe Vera and swallow. Just a lil atleast once a day
Or olive oil one table spoon early in the morning b4 breakfast. Allah sawaqe
2497 2018-08-15 18:49:27 I don’t know how oil or energy works well with USD ripping higher. Demand has to be getting hit hard in EM countries. Sadly an likely macro short trade to be short energy.
2498 2018-08-15 18:49:23 Damn doctors been pumping one of my friends full of pills and medication for a year and she was getting worse. One week on CBD OIL and straight juicing and her body is doing a 360! #THEMEDICALSCAMISREAL

2502 2018-08-15 18:48:53 So true and I’m thankful I got a lipstick and not a liquid lip bc I just don’t like those, I have natural lines in my lips I always have so I need a reg lipstick or I look crusty. I was about to buy a nail oil anyways so bless this box for that and the HoL I got in Bambi...
2503 2018-08-15 18:48:41 I love nature.
I live in it and around it 24x7
I also recognize that to maintain the standard of living that you and I enjoy we have to develop, export and utilize our own resources.
The world's thirst for oil is not going anywhere, and we can do it better.
2504 2018-08-15 18:48:30 This is kind what I said elsewhere but considerably more detailed : )
It's "fixing" a problem that doesn't exist.
You can't fuel it at home.
You can't fuel it ANYWHERE there's an electrical outlet.
Probably backed by big oil.
Enough already with this nonsense.
2505 2018-08-15 18:48:24 It's very easy to do and should be done. Period. If he wants to continue playing hockey, he can stay in Europe.
2506 2018-08-15 18:48:23 It's a govt concession, tho I doubt anyone else would want to bid for it. Until recently, cd only raise fares every 10 years. Now they can if oil goes up. Many of boatmen, ticket-takers are 2nd, 3rd generation. The P's provide boat staff w/ housing near river.
2507 2018-08-15 18:48:21 He doesn't know yet that the hair is in for another coconut oil mask and a wash in the next few days...
2508 2018-08-15 18:48:18 Lol. You mean those guys who just started taking oil and gas money after only refusing it for two months or the same assistance that had 42 senators vote for a 700+billion dollar “defense” spending bill?
2509 2018-08-15 18:48:12 Nah its the baby oil on jjs desk

2515 2018-08-15 18:46:38 Unelected? You know what the European Elections are for don't you?
£70bn deficit? You mean the £12bn minus oil compared to the worst national debt of any EU country with the UK.
Christ keep up
2516 2018-08-15 18:46:37 got my oil leak fixed but my car is still leaking oil so that’s cool i guess
2517 2018-08-15 18:46:32 @CBDMedixCo can your oil be vaped as an additive
2518 2018-08-15 18:46:28 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.

2520 2018-08-15 18:46:10 Its about time.  the oil has almost been completely drained from the  engine...don't understand why we waited so long except TTT.   This is  good news.

2522 2018-08-15 18:46:02 I just got into oil and I’m in love.
2523 2018-08-15 18:45:53 Oil leak?
2524 2018-08-15 18:45:53 Does anyone know where they do an oil change for a low price?
2525 2018-08-15 18:45:48 a tube of Aquaphor left in my shorts pocket means oil stains all over my washed laundry :-) #imtotallyfine #FUCK
2526 2018-08-15 18:45:41 @FZucchi btw, muy bueno call re oil likley back into 64's. if I recall.
2527 2018-08-15 18:45:28 But falsifying intelligence for oil wars is fine. GTFO
2528 2018-08-15 18:45:27 I agree with Min. Jordan 100%; Guyana has to be disciplined with how they deal with the pending oil windfall. And they need to learn from past mistakes. #NorwayOrNeighbourWayWebinar
2529 2018-08-15 18:44:46 I feel badly I even thought he was "with" us. Snake oil salesman comes to mind.
2530 2018-08-15 18:44:33 An oil rich country by the way.
2531 2018-08-15 18:44:26 It’s a nano-zeolite that encapsulates heavy metals & even crosses the bbb to remove them from the body. Look up TRS by Coseva. I have chronic joint pain, I think RA. But after I had my daughter I had whole body pain for a year. I still have joint pain tho but cbd oil is helping!
2532 2018-08-15 18:44:23 i put coconut oil in my hair before going in the bath and now i’m sliding all over the place help
2533 2018-08-15 18:44:21 Me & Losers are like water and oil. We don't mix for shit!
2534 2018-08-15 18:44:13 There you go Alex just for you, more information about how Scotlands oil saved the UK bacon.

2537 2018-08-15 18:44:02 Yes.  China been busy offloading USD's for commodities b/c US entitlement obligations alone are ~70 years of 100% of global oil supplies at 100m b/d & $60/bbl, & oil is by far the biggest commodity mkt.

2539 2018-08-15 18:43:51 I think the lipstick, lashes and nail oil is all I really like from this months box. But ya can’t win em all I guess. This is why I like the subscribe box idea, I didn’t waste a whole bunch of money on these flops now
2540 2018-08-15 18:43:46 Most leagues allow players with domestic records to continue their careers, but I assume there will be some sort of suspension to be served and it could be heavy-handed such as 41 games (half the season) in which case Voynov wouldn't make sense for Oilers as Sekera replacement.
2541 2018-08-15 18:43:43 #oilers hot take. The Sekera injury buys the mgmt group another year. Any injury to the blue line on top of this will make the Oil a terrible terrible team.
2542 2018-08-15 18:43:29 Today I got a salad given to me that's just arugula, prosciutto and truffle oil. That's my kind of salad.
2543 2018-08-15 18:43:16 Shower and coconut oil rub down compilation unconquerable
2544 2018-08-15 18:43:09 Few will get the inside joke! :P
BTW just curious: how much of Indian foreign reserves . if any, is not in USD?
Since crude oil is marked against USD, i don't think there would be more than 10%?
2545 2018-08-15 18:43:06 It’s still Scotland’s oil let’s claim it Time to go
2546 2018-08-15 18:42:51 Dennis Bergkamp vs North Sea Oil
2547 2018-08-15 18:42:46 LCV cherry picks scores. For example, they scored a procedural vote to recommit and claimed IL Rep. Bob Dold supported drilling for oil in Lake Michigan! Total fabrication. LCV endorsed against multiple GOP members of Climate Solutions Caucus. So much for bipartisanship.
2548 2018-08-15 18:42:42 If you don’t use cobra oil on your hair, you’re missing out

2555 2018-08-15 18:41:53 Since it is so good for da soul I confess I WILL use a dose of MCT oil in my afternoon cold brew. For sup sake .

2559 2018-08-15 18:41:37 Why is it take 20938292 hours to change my oil? 
2560 2018-08-15 18:41:37 Poor thing. Have you talked to your vet about trying to use CBD oil? It helps a lot with humans, I would assume it would have a similar effect on animals.
2561 2018-08-15 18:41:32 But trump is fulfilling his promises n making economic reforms. This present govt can't even diversify d economic but still making research on oil resources which might b oblivious in d next decade.
2562 2018-08-15 18:41:30 I use water and oil. Palmade make my hair stick up. But I use that black Jamaican oil or whatever it’s called
2563 2018-08-15 18:41:29 Years ago we didn’t have cameras, we had to make an oil painting of what was in there.

2565 2018-08-15 18:40:46 See this is why I love coming to this auto shop. I thought I was near my mileage for an oil change but I wasn't so she was like you still have a while do you want us to change it now or wait  I still had other expense but shiiidddd I just save some coins

2567 2018-08-15 18:40:23 Olive oil mayonnaise ftw
2568 2018-08-15 18:40:22 This is true !! Same goes for sun cream you can use coconut oil which has a natural spf of about 4 n then any other natural oils to boost it up like raspberry oil !!
2569 2018-08-15 18:40:17 That's what happens when they treat their schizophrenia with AJ's snake oil.
2570 2018-08-15 18:40:14 Switzerland has no enemies that's my point. Keep building up weapons and I promise you will have plenty of enemies. It's a road to only death. Oil fields make easy targets. I'd lay low and enjoy life

2574 2018-08-15 18:39:57 The difference with Robidas Island was the Leafs had a plethora of cap space at the time. I'm sure you have noticed that no one is on said island at the moment...just the leftovers from the Kessel deal.
2575 2018-08-15 18:39:55 Anyway I am putting down the pipe - heading to the gym - need a oil free few hours OPEX on the flipside - good chat - good peeps here :)
2576 2018-08-15 18:39:48 I put that on there because my car burns oil pretty bad and it smokes a lot, but I don’t drive it too much and I have an engine rebuild coming soon so I won’t be hurting the environment too much longer!

2578 2018-08-15 18:39:38 Labour did its very best to stop devolution. When 1st Referendum was YES Labour, yes Labour, changed the rules to defeat ‘sovereign will of the Scottish People’. When in 1998 Scotland voted overwhelmingly, Blair,Brown, Dewar moved the Sea boundaries to award England more oil.

2589 2018-08-15 18:38:44 What are you on about mate? That wasn’t her point. She’s saying that your money came from corrupt oil, which it did.
2590 2018-08-15 18:38:44 If this is BC forest fire smoke are we going to boycott BC wine & slow the flow of oil west until they take it back? If it’s US smoke, I think we should double the maple syrup tariffs...

2602 2018-08-15 18:37:26 generally all plants but I hope they're mainly talking about refined plant parts eg sugar and oil, rather than real food which is healthy
2603 2018-08-15 18:37:19 Bought vanilla and mango scent beard oil, smelling class now. Who’s wantin it?
2604 2018-08-15 18:37:13 Satan can’t control the people when the Sons of God pour fresh oil on all skulls everyday. That’s why the elite rich American billionaire class sorcerers are in a constant temper tantrum. We will drive all fallen angel influence out of the USA quickly!

2609 2018-08-15 18:36:46 Yes b/c the Oilers season was going oh so well prior to Sekera coming back. Might there be a reason as to why Auvitu is no longer in the league? On a better blueline, you could try it but on the Oilers backend, that wasn't possible. The coach didn't put the roster together.
2610 2018-08-15 18:36:44 My younger sister and my nephew split at 5litre of my used motor oil.  Where am I gonna get it again.
2611 2018-08-15 18:36:35 Waiting for an oil change and looking at lunch options...help me choose!

2614 2018-08-15 18:36:25 Wouldn't the "good & smart" thing to do be to get off the finite oil, gas, and coal that are poisoning us and changing the climate? Plus we are still very dependent on oil imports.

2617 2018-08-15 18:36:14 1) Yes. I actually had a chance to talk to Jarl Pedersen, the CCO of Port Corpus Christi at an oil summit recently. They do a lot to make Port Corpus Christi the export hub of the shale. However, none of those projects will be completed in the next 12 months.

2620 2018-08-15 18:35:50 That's interesting because oil revenues have been  zero for the last three years ..
2621 2018-08-15 18:35:41 I want to try to sign a lifetime deal with a cbd oil company similar to the LeBron/Nike deal. Instead of a billion dollars I would just like free stuff.

2624 2018-08-15 18:35:25 But if you just stop eating sugar, and mix this essential oil with baking soda and eat it... 
2625 2018-08-15 18:35:21 Tell me how an endangered listing will “hinder development, which is primarily oil and gas extraction.” And there’s more than oil and gas. That’s what opponents argue with no basis.
2626 2018-08-15 18:35:19 Stay away from Budget car rental at the Detroit airport.  I picked up a car that was dirty and had old pills in it and the dash alerted me to get the oil changed.  I took it back and the counter person did not care and gave me a crap car as a replacement.  Also dirty. I gave up.

2629 2018-08-15 18:35:09 Well explained but oil??? The import impact and vulnerability arising out of it?
2630 2018-08-15 18:35:07 Go Pro lenses-Drone optics--all need regular #opticalcleaning to maintain pristine conditions for optimum imaging. Nothing better than #ROR to do the job-- the only Residual Oil Remover that gets that grimy residue off lens surfaces--the difference is "CLEAR"!!!
2631 2018-08-15 18:34:57 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
2632 2018-08-15 18:34:56 Do you ever have to swap out the goo? Is it like an oil change? Every five hundred streams or ten thousand miles?
2633 2018-08-15 18:34:45 I should hope so you have 30 million people and lots of oil. You have no rights or freedom though so you are a slave. Oh and you have real slaves as well. If thou think oil will be used for more then next 50 years you better hope sand price as go up
2634 2018-08-15 18:34:39 That is a whopper...brilliant piccy !!

2643 2018-08-15 18:33:36 There are rumors swirling that he uses a disturbingly large amount of self-tanning oil.

2645 2018-08-15 18:33:32 My favorite essential oil is bacon grease.
2646 2018-08-15 18:33:31 Make 'em  w/o sugar & salt, & maybe even add chives to enjoy some Korean style pancakes. You can cut way back on the butter/oil as well. Maybe try a tad bit of coconut oil on the pan instead.

Now they're no longer dessert food, & won't really be that bad for you at all. Simple.
2647 2018-08-15 18:33:24 Got a oil change my car acting brand new

2650 2018-08-15 18:32:38 I feel bad for the leather seats in this Uber, I just put hella coconut oil in my hair…
2651 2018-08-15 18:32:34 Just start with high quality coffee bean, organic coconut oil, and grass fed butter. You can get all that.
2652 2018-08-15 18:32:20 Maybe it needs an oil massage
2653 2018-08-15 18:32:14 You can’t beat a good roast potato. Get it well part-boiled and roughed up on the outside, in really hot oil so it’s crispy outside and fluffy inside. @HannahTuck17 what are latkes?
2654 2018-08-15 18:31:54 Ha. Its actually a marinade of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, pepper and herbs. Score the meat, marinade for a couple of hours, two mins either side in a hot pan, 6-8 mins in a hot oven, let sit for 5 mins. They were awesome.
2655 2018-08-15 18:31:53 Shame people are still blaming palm oil for the destruction of the rainforest when the meat and dairy industry is the biggest cause #vegan #greenpeace #rangtan #orangutan #rainforest

2659 2018-08-15 18:31:19 It bloody STINKS when you fry garlic at high heat! Why can’t you open all the windows, skylights and CLOSE THE LOUNGE DOOR, so the rest of the flat doesn’t reek of garlic and oil for the next week?! How about it, eh?!

NVM, only a week or so left of putting up with this... #zen
2660 2018-08-15 18:31:01 Yes, keto is for real. No carbs, no fats, no dairy. So it's just your eggs, beans, grilled meats (no oil or sauce) and veggies. Takes about a week to get your body into ketosis. Smooth sailing after that.

2679 2018-08-15 18:29:24 Especially when you throw on olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic and put them in the oven   and they come out crispy and juicy 
2680 2018-08-15 18:29:11 Falling off and getting back into oil painting is the most exciting this ever.
2681 2018-08-15 18:29:09 I agree with you, CAFE standards are not the best policy to significantly reduce oil use/emissions as climate needs it, but even for others Fuels in C&T we still need political will!
2682 2018-08-15 18:29:06 WTI oil falls below $65/barrel for the first time since June 21 on over supply concerns before recovering to the current $65.05, -$1.98.

Sir Ian Wood predicted in 2014 that the oil was fast running out & Scotland could afford neither uncertainty nor volatility of oil & gas market

I presume, it is for this reason Oil exploration was never well pursued for decades by CONgis, तो keep India dependent upon imports and transferring India's wealth abroad
2688 2018-08-15 18:28:03 This is oil to sell overseas not for domestic needs But as Nicon said if we do not raise the price this Country will be out of oil by 1970

2694 2018-08-15 18:27:34 Crisco is an  factory created oil that causes inflammation. It should not be considered a food. What a waste of science/money resources and is misleading
Look up the Eskimo studies-about what happened to their health of those who replaced Whale Fat with Crisco.  just start there.

2725 2018-08-15 18:25:09 Yup learn from history. When oil runs out so you really want the world hating you? Making friends works much easier. Ask yourself do you like cities in your nation or do want only sand? Sick with cities
2726 2018-08-15 18:25:06 This one has 550k and does use a drop of oil. I haven't had it long enough to have an opinion either way yet. Starts damn good in the winter.
2727 2018-08-15 18:25:02 Danish oil is fine. Any oil TBH. Once the oil is cured it's all foodsafe. Don't go and buy expensive "worktop oil". Load of bollocks. Get Danish from Homebase or B&Q or online. Just make sure it's left to fully cure.
2728 2018-08-15 18:24:59 I hate getting my oil changed bc they tell me I need like a billion dollars worth of work done and I’m like “I’m broke” and I guess they don’t believe me bc they keep trying to talk me into it lmao

2744 2018-08-15 18:22:53 I'm officially at a point in my life where I have to debate which things (financially) take priority over others...today, an oil change and inspection are taking priority over groceries #adulting

2748 2018-08-15 18:22:40 First time I saw you on TV was when you were doing Shrimp Etouffee on one of her PBS shows. I saw all that vegetable oil and was like "Man, I wanna see more from this guy" That's what, 20 years ago now? Miss her dearly.

2750 2018-08-15 18:22:35 So essentially what you are saying is that even though every other oil producing country is ramping up production to meeting global demands that Canada should be the only one taking the hit by reducing our production?
2751 2018-08-15 18:22:27 Is there any way to grow my beard out properly without it looking like a damn bird’s nest? I use beard oil and balm and it’s somehow still not enough .-.
2752 2018-08-15 18:22:06 What other countries are you accusing of “stealing”? You do realise that that’s libel/slander, and also a bit rich coming from a country that murders innocents for oil?

2760 2018-08-15 18:21:10 Unfortunately, you present it in such a way that it reinforces oil company propaganda.

2768 2018-08-15 18:19:54 The FT article suggests wave of corporate mergers & acquisitions welding together smaller players into larger companies.

2790 2018-08-15 18:17:41 Complete nonsense, as even 5 minutes of actually thinking about the issue would reveal to you. Women are not flocking to garbage disposal or oil drilling jobs, for example. Inclusiveness is not the reason. No "field" is preventing women from entering - it is their choices.

2854 2018-08-15 18:10:47 Venezuela was not subsidizing the tax payers, they were subsidizing the oil companies. That's not social, it's capital. Without the social protections, there is no capital. You cannot have one without the other.

2885 2018-08-15 18:07:57 Too much MCT oil to start with can cause disaster pants or stomach cramps.

2887 2018-08-15 18:07:42 He’s like, why so hostile? Like it’s my fault this jerk thought I don’t understand motor oil? I said, ‘go fuck your self and get your ass outta my face before you get laid out in public by a little lady!’ He ran away...

2890 2018-08-15 18:07:32 Those construction signs that say “fresh oil and chips” make me so hungry.
2891 2018-08-15 18:07:28 having to get a car inspection makes no sense to me. whenever i get an oil change or tires rotated or any other kind of maintenance thing, they always come back telling me i need to fix this or that. so isn’t that already an inspection?
2892 2018-08-15 18:07:24 I want some glitter lipstick, and some fuckin shimmering body oil
2893 2018-08-15 18:07:17 Cheap oil is stealth QE
2894 2018-08-15 18:07:06 Stripped my oil plug, spilled oil in my trunk and it’s started raining on me while trying to get the bolt loose. I’m upset

2899 2018-08-15 18:06:41 So oil does not belong to the community, which is a good thing because the community is a bunch of shiftless hippies or worse too lazy and unfocused to use it,
2900 2018-08-15 18:06:35 Oil I didn't even know people were complaining.

2904 2018-08-15 18:06:08 Whose plan ? A plan to flow oil or a plan of diminishing returns to pis who are constantly watching their cash drain away ? SS needs to keep his investors happy by providing regular updates. Silence is not encouraging.
2905 2018-08-15 18:06:06 does bacon grease count as an essential oil?
2906 2018-08-15 18:05:53 You do realize...  that if the price of oil was never pumped up in the mid 00s (thanks to loose monetary policy)... that neither Venezuela nor Russia would have been much of a threat, right?

Doubt Fed apologists... cough... insana... cough... will ever admit to that...
2907 2018-08-15 18:05:31 It's not terrible, though I would argue it does do damage to the industry. The perception of SEO as a bunch of snake oil salesmen, performing witchcraft on websites/content, in order to rank in Google.

2911 2018-08-15 18:05:15 get some clove oil, get a cotton bud and dab it on your wisdom teeth
2912 2018-08-15 18:05:00 What's worse is they wouldn't even replace it. After all, the replacement would have the same issue since the surface isn't meant to be in contact with skin grease/oil all the time.....

2916 2018-08-15 18:04:47 The one who strikes the oil gets to keep the proceeds of selling and marketing it.  It is not the case the oil suddenly belongs to the community, or the country it is found in.  This is a good thing because it invites development of the resource to add value for society.

2922 2018-08-15 18:04:31 One argument used by open border, pro mass migration advocates is that we have low birth/replacement rates necessitating bringing in high numbers of migrants to financially support social programs and drive economic growth into the future.

2925 2018-08-15 18:03:39 “do him like Gaddafi”

A guy murdered by the global elite, because he had the nerve to want to make an African dollar backed by gold. Gave interest free government loans for homes to couples who had just been married. And wanted to sell his oil to someone other than France.

2927 2018-08-15 18:03:38 And you guys are concerned about oil spills? This is way worse. People in Alberta are suffering at your expense. #makecanadaproud
2928 2018-08-15 18:03:37 At one time before the lunatic Reagan era and the Gingrich destruction of congress and before corporations were people bipartisan legislation worked to control monopolies and we didn’t turn in to communist Russia or China. Standard Oil, The Railroads, AT&T (Ma Bell) and others
2929 2018-08-15 18:03:36 Imperialism is merely an extension of nationalism. That's why the US sticks it's flag everywhere it goes. 

"AIPAC" aren't the only people controlling american foreign policy, the oil company UNOCAL, and the arms corporations also are part of the equation. 

I.E CAPITALISM.
2930 2018-08-15 18:03:24 That is my cousin's. He works the oil rigs. You should see the other side, painted like a goalie mask. Cool stuff.

2932 2018-08-15 18:02:52 Took my car to get a oil change and don’t want to go back to pick it up. It’s costing me too much money, they can have it 
2933 2018-08-15 18:02:47 How soon can you wash your hair again after getting a hot oil treatment? Or is there no limit?
2934 2018-08-15 18:02:47 The difference is that you need USD to buy, say, oil.  What exactly would be the motivation for using Bitcoin as a reserve currency?
2935 2018-08-15 18:02:44 He’ll deny it or ignore it, then say he’s considering allowing oil drills in all national parks as a deflection.
2936 2018-08-15 18:02:27 The saudis can literally control the price of oil,they increase production to a point where they can dump their product into  and make our oil more expensive in comparison.I wonder if cars were being dumped into  and it impacted our auto sector if a tariff would be added
2937 2018-08-15 18:02:25 And it starts off as our income also, and we pay (due to the unique status of whisky and oil) more tax per head than the rest of the U.K. We are also the most successful in business terms & growth terms.

2939 2018-08-15 18:02:14 Let me ask the government or Trump, the price of oil per barrel is down over 2% but the price of gas remains the same but when the price of oil  goes up retailers don't hesitate and increase the price of gas, where is the consumer protection agency and what are they doing
2940 2018-08-15 18:02:07 Once it sinks, it can't be cleaned up. It is only like crude in that it is an oil sand product. One of the main objections to its construction is that difference - see Kalamazoo spill in Michigan versus other crude oil spills. Crucial difference.

Fun fact: Potassium sorbate is a skin, eye and respiratory irritant.
2947 2018-08-15 18:01:34 ...and don’t underestimate Norway, they supply about 25% of EU oil and gas and has a massive surplus which it invests in what is one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. We aren’t so “rich” in comparison.
2948 2018-08-15 18:01:29 I meant to bring my 3ds in so I could play it while waiting for my oil change and guess what I forgot to do
2949 2018-08-15 18:01:28 I doubt it. Fire destroys the oil that contains the chemical compounds that causes the problems with poison ivy.
2950 2018-08-15 18:01:27 I’ve got a half a gallon of squirrel oil at the house if you need it.
2951 2018-08-15 18:01:25 Too much oil on my timeline this morning
2952 2018-08-15 18:01:06 Please you and the people like you do not come to our country. Leave us alone. You bring death to Iraq and Afghanistan for the sake of oil as your savage fathers slaughtered millions of Indians in the continent.

2968 2018-08-15 17:59:49 Indees. The Paris fraud is absolutely useless for the environment. Oil companies base their estimates on reality.

2972 2018-08-15 17:59:18 I throw rocks at Mitch on Twitter sometimes, but I wanted to say that I appreciate what he is doing to push the Hemp Farming Act through Congress. I suffer from bad inflammation that CBD oil helps so much and I can still work and function.  Helps farmers down in KY too.
2973 2018-08-15 17:59:08 I live in Oklahoma. Besides this latest example of hate, our state is broke, we can’t fund education, we’ve cut taxes to the point that we have poor infrastructure/roads & big oil & gas have injected waste water to the point we have weekly earthquakes. Sound familiar? Red State.

2988 2018-08-15 17:58:02 Not a fair comparison. Our football has been a cartel for years with a predictable stranglehold of the big four teams. Citehs oil wealth comes out the ground it’s obscene and anyone attempting to compete will fail. The Scots have been left to rot and nothing’s changing soon

2999 2018-08-15 17:56:52 Has the US ever been a net exporter of oil?
3000 2018-08-15 17:56:52 There is a Meyer reference to Perot and a Brent reference to oil coming up and very similar to Trent. It ties to my aunt with the Jeff reference to Niederhoffer in LA and Scruggs.
3001 2018-08-15 17:56:40 That's the letter which showed Prof Hughes Hallet didn't know how taxes from NS Oil were calculated. He was roundly laughed at by every other economist in the UK in consequence. And me.

3005 2018-08-15 17:55:56 From safest to most dangerous things to take that works for my inflammation I would say the order is cbd oil -> ibuprofen -> codeine.
3006 2018-08-15 17:55:42 Boil water (5 min) while heating olive oil and chopping broccoli while you wait for the water to boil.
Add broccoli to heated oil, press garlic into it, pinch salt. Lid, cook at low for 10 min.
Cook angel hair pasta (2 min max!)
Mix it all together.
Dinner in 15 min.!
3007 2018-08-15 17:55:31 What we ought to do, as the party aligned w/ the material sectors (big agriculture, the nefarious oil companies of left wing fever dreams): refuse to associate w/ left wingers.

“We don’t have to provide you food & gasoline. We’re a private company. Grow/refine your own stuff.”
3008 2018-08-15 17:55:17 on a serious note.. use coconut oil spray. not a lot of it though or it’ll make it oily. that’s what i use & it’s takes literally all the frizz out :)

3017 2018-08-15 17:54:17 So you’d prefer drilling for oil off the coast and waiting for the day our fishing industry collapses? Allowing unregulated dumping of chemicals and zero $ to clean up superfund sites? Anyone that cares about drinking water is anti trump.
3018 2018-08-15 17:54:08 , @Hyperdrug I'm unimpressed. Ordered pet laxative on saturday, asked for 24 hour tracked shipping. Just got an email saying it's been posted TODAY and no tracking number. Just as well the olive oil i used worked. Won't bother with your "service" again.

3020 2018-08-15 17:53:17 Have asked before, and I acknowledge you are an expert in oil and gas

How many Eastern Canada refineries are presently capable of refining Alberta heavy oil?

What is the cost to retrofit those that are not?

Who pays for the retrofit, are refiners on board with the investment?
3021 2018-08-15 17:53:12 Here's a comment I haven't seen Wed re. sell-off in crude oil: 
Crude oil lower as weekly stocks number continues to confirm the downtrend in CLV8/CLX8 that began following the peak of 6/28 at an inverse of 81cts. Spread sitting at an inverse of 27cts, w/daily stocks nearing 20%.

3023 2018-08-15 17:53:05 We use Esso here in the UK too. The company used to be known as Eastern States Standard Oil, of which Esso is an acronym. Not sure why in the US it changed to Exxon- mergers, probably.
3024 2018-08-15 17:53:04 The NPDQ will eliminate all subsidies to polluting industries by 2025, including the oil industry, because paying for pollution is bad economics. One more reason why I am #NPDQ. #polqc #qc2018
3025 2018-08-15 17:52:36 Would double hulled pipelines solve this problem? Would they be cheaper than the cost of cleaning up the seemingly inevitable oil spills?
3026 2018-08-15 17:52:25 Alexa, pay for my oil change

my Dear Azzam Aldakhil...??!  Soon no more oil...Then what?
3030 2018-08-15 17:51:35 Tengo que dejar de ilusionarme por cualquier pelotudez
3031 2018-08-15 17:51:33 On sale now for $62, regular $68 until the end of August!  Full spectrum CBD Oil with coconut oil and Trace Minerals.  No shipping charges.   Get you oil while supplies last.
3032 2018-08-15 17:51:32 Just ate a ham salami mozzarella lettuce tomato oil& vinegar sandwich in 3 min. 20% scared, 80% impressed.
3033 2018-08-15 17:51:31 When I was away I’d run out of cbd oil and the only thing that worked was 600mg of ibuprofen. I was actually surprised it worked as I’d never really tried it before. So that’s why
3034 2018-08-15 17:51:23 The oil tankers all run off solar panels made from recycled plastic drinking straws.
3035 2018-08-15 17:51:05 Was brought up getting thrown in the water at Dalgety bay, dodging beer cans, oil & other bits of toiletries, in my underpants swimming next to a fence into rosyth dock yard! While my old man sat smoking
3036 2018-08-15 17:50:59 Surely this isn’t the same oil that was running out and backed up by mr Wood?  There again I am sure the MSM facilitated Westminster in ensuring oil was a bad commodity to have
3037 2018-08-15 17:50:57 Took an ibuprofen for the inflamation, I find it works quite well and might be a cheaper alternative to cbd oil. I’m gonna just try it for a while and see how well it can manage my symptoms with a maximum dose between 400 to 800mg a time.

3040 2018-08-15 17:50:26 True mukoma I always say everytime we import basics like cooking oil, soap etc we are exporting jobs. The less we produce locally the less jobs we have and the less money we have circulating. Our huge trade deficit is at the heart of our economic woes.
3041 2018-08-15 17:50:25 Contestant on #Chopped: Ima add some sesame oil / truffle oil on this to give it more flavor.

3048 2018-08-15 17:49:46 Seattle's Best is my new favorite coffee. Tastes good and has an oil slick to it.
3049 2018-08-15 17:49:38 Who trying to cop some massage oil?

3050 2018-08-15 17:49:37 The American military and militant groups funded by it have killed way more civilians than the people they’re going after it’s almost like it’s all just a manufactured excuse to seize oil

3052 2018-08-15 17:49:25 There is a reason why people pay others to change their oil for them. Love our Raptor zero-turn mower. It's a must for anyone with an acre or more to mow. But changing Kohler engine oil is a major PIA. @HustlerTurf

3057 2018-08-15 17:48:54 I hate to do big purchases, but I'll tell you that while I've regretted some home goods purchases, I've never regretted by a piece of art. I don't give a satisfied sigh when I look at my refrigerator, but do when I look at my pottery and a nice oil of a New Mexico scene.
3058 2018-08-15 17:48:53 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
3059 2018-08-15 17:48:47 and invade. Like why the fuck would you go to the east and invade? Opium oil and a chance to keep them unified
3060 2018-08-15 17:48:40 What about tobacco oil property school gold etc merchants in channel field
3061 2018-08-15 17:48:38 Sara Eisen types will never allow themselves to understand the '73 oil embargo resulted from a devaluing dollar and domestic price controls/allocations. We set ourselves up with a floating dollar and controls.
3062 2018-08-15 17:48:35 Blame FG for the price of crude oil in the international market or the tax payments by companies?
How???
3063 2018-08-15 17:48:31 How's that mowed lawn smell mix with the gasoline and oil smell, and the noise of the mower, and the vibrations? Just wondering.
3064 2018-08-15 17:48:27 "Ma'am are you aware you have an oil leak?" Sadly
3065 2018-08-15 17:48:25 Learn to count for the last 6 .. if u have a global crisis n u do a qe to stem it in the form of nrega and 100 dollar oil .. to keep an engine running u need to sacrifice wood .

3066 2018-08-15 17:48:18 I'm a massage therapist and I studied aromatherapy in massage school. You CAN ingest it, but very small amounts and with a carrier oil like such as coconut oil. Anyone who wants to ingest needs to do a lot of research and understand it can be harmful, but to be careful
3067 2018-08-15 17:48:14 The most common acting note I get is to “pat off some of the oil on my face”
3068 2018-08-15 17:48:08 I think it is also a bone to those "stans" we were just talking about (it is not as if it takes much to give them hope). A bit of oil on the fan wars is no problem as ultimately of course they want all to keep watching...
3069 2018-08-15 17:48:06 Their media captive to Arab oil rich owners don't tell them a thing about the vile side. They never read about the rockets on nursery schools, the decapitation of babies, the stabbing in the street. They do read about our response -- out of context
3070 2018-08-15 17:47:55 Finding out your friends are ARMY is better than striking oil
3071 2018-08-15 17:47:42 So I burnt my face with oil. At this point I’m ready to throw myself away.
3072 2018-08-15 17:47:38 I’ve been waiting on this oil change since 11:00
3073 2018-08-15 17:47:32 Coconut oil isn’t for everyone especially if you have oily skin it will most likely clog your pores. Stay woke.

Living a global village, her economy also depends on international trade for revenues and the maintenance of currency reserve. 
You can have the oil, but where are you gonna sell it?

3094 2018-08-15 17:45:19 Which is why we should adopt the Norwegian model. You want our oil we get 70% of the barrel price. In Angola the state took a 75% share.
3095 2018-08-15 17:45:16 He lost the popular vote by 2 million - his people are corporations, the far right and the electoral college. His people fell for a snake oil salesman hitting all the right catchphrases. So no - WE as a majority are not HIS people - just people who have to deal with him.

3109 2018-08-15 17:43:32 my friend just started and it seems tough. they literally told her to drink spoonfuls of oil when she needs a "snack"

3118 2018-08-15 17:43:09 Yep - I wouldn't rule it out either. The very second the centrists think Sanders won't run you'll see them revert to the right wing, in order to get cash from the mega-donors at the mega-corporations.
The centrists can hardly stop themslvs on that - they just ok'd $$ from big oil
3119 2018-08-15 17:43:07 If your muscles are tense and you need to relax I hands down recommend soaking in a hot bath with 1-2 drops of peppermint oil. I get a massage once a month but have NEVER been as relaxed as that peppermint oil made me. It also gets rid of my migraines in about 10-15 minutes.

3126 2018-08-15 17:42:17 You’ll excuse me if I don’t care. In my experience Aberdonians didn’t give a hoot for less fortunate peoples across the country while they reaped the benefits from oil industry. Even recently you received a handout from @scotgov . Stop bleating & start working like others
3127 2018-08-15 17:42:06 Post US imperium mideast lineups emerging, Russia putatively on Iran's side but stands to gain from oil price rise due to market disruption, sponsoring Taleban pays back US & increases instability at risk of emboldening internal fundamentalists, counting on military to stay safe.
3128 2018-08-15 17:41:36 Also, do you think ‘don’t knock it until you’ve tried it’ is a reasonable rule to apply to any health care claim? Couldn’t you apply this same rule to any brand of snake oil? Shouldn’t the rule be: prove it works, THEN I’ll try it?

3136 2018-08-15 17:40:53 What post 2001 shows is an insane direction of intervention. Reagan pulled out of Beirut precisely because we didn't know, could not prove, who was responsible. (Iran).

3143 2018-08-15 17:39:55 There has to be more to this than we know, some are getting rich by importing foreign oil over our own. Some say Irving oil, others say Quebec would lose jobs and revenue if the tankers didn’t dock there, who knows but it’s time we found out.
3144 2018-08-15 17:39:46 Omg I’m getting my oil changed rn and the woman is here with her toddler. And she’s trying to get him to leave with her and she’s goes “cmon it’s time for short sleep! Then we get to go see grandma!”

Short sleep. Instead of nap. Soooo cute. And smart

3156 2018-08-15 17:38:05 Aftab Iqbal: Pakistan is bearing losses worth of Rs. 75 Billion yearly because of oil mafia (energy sector).

After coming in power, please quickly take notice of this. @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial

3157 2018-08-15 17:37:56 need to get a vat of anointing oil, wondering if it comes wholesale. 
Just gonna pour the whole damn thing over the building. Set a drip over the doors so all these children get a little bit. 
Jesus is the only one that can fix this foolishness today.

3161 2018-08-15 17:37:26 The thing is, he's really not. They're going to privatize their healthcare. How many live on the streets and commit suicide bc of PTSD and such. How much money do you really make while in (as "just" a soldier?) How many are "guarding" poppy fields and oil fields in the mid east?
3162 2018-08-15 17:37:20 I love that i know how to change different things and filters on my car. Guy doing my oil change tried to get over on me and i told him i know how to do it myself for $10 & he looked like at me like  also gave him my 2 coupons 
3163 2018-08-15 17:36:52 Oh god @THEkarliehustle  latest #BrutallyHonest ep..not the canola oil from the lays potato chips as part of the regime..LOL 
3164 2018-08-15 17:36:42 So it looks like Venezuela is pegging salaries and pensions to the Petro.

Am I misinterpreting something or are they just trying to replace currency with oil?
3165 2018-08-15 17:36:30 okay covering myself in baby oil after i get out of the shower freshly shaved has CHANGED MY LIFE

3171 2018-08-15 17:35:53 finally getting my oil changed cause kayla said my car would catch on fire if it has no oil 
3172 2018-08-15 17:35:52 Cons are control freaks. Just look at 44 years of control in AB. I'd not known of the Tapcal Trust Fund, the deaths of kids in foster care, the waste  of cash by the "fiscally conservative" PCs, the infrastructure deficit, the subsidization of oil industry. Control freaks.

Over 70% of Republicans supported someone else for their nominee. 
They were right.

3180 2018-08-15 17:34:39 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies, financial conflicts, intellectual deficit, fire and fury tweets boggles the mind. Exhausting
3181 2018-08-15 17:34:31 Let me know where you cut as I bought some extra oil along with you...Thanks
3182 2018-08-15 17:34:30 Weird that for hundreds of thousands of years before the invention of money, humans acted competitively and ruthlessly for other resources

3185 2018-08-15 17:34:09 Venezuela is an Autocratic Dictatorship. They are in the situation they are in because of currency manipulation and the collapse of the price per barrel of oil.

3189 2018-08-15 17:33:42 It's embarassing for me as an African to hear other Africans cite natural resources (oil,diamonds,gold etc) as wealth.."Africa is rich because it's got all sorts of natural resources.".We should wake up!!
3190 2018-08-15 17:33:38 Have some olive oil. Stop begging.
3191 2018-08-15 17:33:06 I know. Reagan asked the same question. Oil, Israel, and the Soviet Union. In interchangable order. The early 80s did see the Soviets remove themselves completely from ME. Cold War had to stay cold.
3192 2018-08-15 17:33:02 When my players rolled two barrels of oil through a dungeon so they could chuck flaming barrels at the enemy leader as soon as they came into a room.
I had dialogue planned for him, but instead the fight started by the enemy getting hit in the gut by a barrel

3201 2018-08-15 17:31:58 Production is up 2MMbpd YoY last time I checked and demand was growing 1.4MMbpd, but I expect that to slip to 1-1.2MMbpd. Why cant supply accelerate given where oil prices were. In Q2 and Q3 last year they were $10-15 lower than recently... maybe supply accelerates to 2.5...

3205 2018-08-15 17:31:36 Continuing to burn oil is not humane. Our bitumen is full of toxic impurities that must be removed and disposed of. Only a handful of facilities in the world can handle it. There are a lot of reasons not to support oil sands production.
3206 2018-08-15 17:31:30 That’s the official title, yeah.. oil rigger dude 
3207 2018-08-15 17:31:09 Deals on Oil diffusers?
3208 2018-08-15 17:31:07 First you have to let the meat cook itself until there isn’t any blood released or water, after it’s dry then you add oil so it can fry itself. I tend to lower the fire while frying so it can be more tender and juicy
3209 2018-08-15 17:31:03 It's coconut oil
3210 2018-08-15 17:31:01 Good. Thankfully regulations are making it more difficult for risky projects to go ahead. If Alberta wants to remain in the oil business they should upgrade bitumen into a product we can use.

3219 2018-08-15 17:29:26 Before opening the tweet, i was wondering when did i carry anointing oil until i saw the second line. 

That boy ehn...
3220 2018-08-15 17:29:26 No fucking way. Is that oil on drums?
3221 2018-08-15 17:29:15 @SHGames can u please change chrome camo, at least make the oil effect move because it took a lot of grinding and its just a disappointment to see that your giving better camos to people who just grind for levels which is alot easier then camos, please #fixchromecamo
3222 2018-08-15 17:28:56 Maybe they should unionize. I’m sure that will solve her issues with the company.
3223 2018-08-15 17:28:54 I'm confused how you define "ethical oil" 

Oil sands oil is the most carbon intensive oil in North America when we factor in the production and processing and the toxic effects of the tailing ponds need to be taken into consideration.

Hardly "ethical" by my standards.
3224 2018-08-15 17:28:43 Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a province or two that produced oil and could ship it they pipelines in country? Maybe those provinces should encourage companies to set up refineries in those provinces? Ahh, if only dreams came true.
3225 2018-08-15 17:28:33 Great shot - I thought this was an oil painting!  

I'm not totally convinced it's not, actually.  @MissBlow , try putting this in the attic and see if it ages instead of you!
3226 2018-08-15 17:28:08 someone go with me to get my oil change so i’m not alone for an hour :/
3227 2018-08-15 17:27:59 I have the best boyfriend ever man he’s gonna take my car to get the oil changed & wash it for me :’) #blessed
3228 2018-08-15 17:27:48 TOTAL DESTRUCTION ... Gulf of Mexico ... the largest oil lease sale in US History by Donald Trump ... millions of acres for ... $178M.
3229 2018-08-15 17:27:48 My stance was always NO and the ONLY PAC donation I had was from wind PAC, as I supported the wind farms. I assume @Colvin4Congress is opposed to oil rigs off our shore also but best to hear from him directly.
3230 2018-08-15 17:27:48 I must keep my avocado oil. Good job Chris you’re doing good
3231 2018-08-15 17:27:42 You have to understand how an economy works it is like an engine the once it is tuned will run well once it's running well it's fantastic don't change the oil neglect the spark plugs pretty soon it'll starts sputtering this is Trump's world
3232 2018-08-15 17:27:17 That or he know's what other kinds of skeletons are in the collective closet's of worldwide, so called "leaders". My bets on that being the case. Oil and water don't mix unless vinegar is added. Trumps just the vinegar imo.
3233 2018-08-15 17:27:10 Están confundiendo "proved reserves" con "oil in place" .
3234 2018-08-15 17:27:02 Reinforces my idea that when either the oil runs out, (Or someone goes all @justcause and nukes the oil fields, whichever comes first...) We won't have to worry about not having plastics, because Cellulose and Chitin are more than suitable alternatives.
3235 2018-08-15 17:26:53 So we have to pay the #carbontax to use the oil as an end user.  But , the dirtiest producers don't pay a dime.  Nice double standard there. #CarbonTaxScam
3236 2018-08-15 17:26:48 On way almost there
3237 2018-08-15 17:26:40 It’s almost 90 degrees.

3238 2018-08-15 17:26:24 Is #Turkey the new Venezuela? 

It hard to deny the similarities. 1) Authoritarian governments that have borrowed foreign currency and spent heavily to ensure the outcome of elections. 2) Economic crisis from external shock: Venezuela was oil prices and Turkey is US sanctions.

3242 2018-08-15 17:26:02 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
3243 2018-08-15 17:26:01 Oil demand is still growing (but EMFX will weigh on increases), production is mostly shifting, not increasing (From VZ/Libya to SA/Russia). These prices will keep a lid on Permian growth
3244 2018-08-15 17:26:00 As for me, I lost a lot of tooth enamel to severe "morning" sickness (mine was 24 hours sickness), my hair gets so dry, I've had to have it cut short and need to slather it with coconut oil before each wash, and I never wear makeup xxx

3247 2018-08-15 17:25:24 Scotland’s Money is actually created in Scotland. We get back a fraction of what we create for the UK purse. Have a look at oil, whisky, water, farming, fishing, textiles, such micron manufacturing. Etc
3248 2018-08-15 17:25:20 You can also argue we paid for it a second time when Westminster grabbed oil in Scottish waters to spend on its own interests, and squander on eradicating democratic institutions it still dislikes, such as collective bargaining by unions.
3249 2018-08-15 17:25:19 Probably from the amount of months it’s been since you last got your oil changed lol
3250 2018-08-15 17:25:13 Here’s the weird thing, right? Mayonnaise is just eggs, salt, and oil. I very much enjoy all those thing separately, and yet ...
3251 2018-08-15 17:25:05 $TSLA   Throw another log on the fire, as plunging oil prices aren't going to help sales.
3252 2018-08-15 17:25:02 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

3257 2018-08-15 17:24:34 I have a friend that does and he swears by it. Also it helps with food you crave and not have ton of oil that comes with it. He makes wings with zero oil and comes out better than if he used oil lol
3258 2018-08-15 17:24:27 hello thank you for you reply. Yes public transportation should be improved. Anyway I was thinking about if India imports less oil, so overall imports to India will decline which will result in less expenditure of Foreign currency will it have any effect on value of rupee?
3259 2018-08-15 17:24:18 Thank you and safety is the key to AMERICAN OIL. :)
3260 2018-08-15 17:24:11 Nice article! Notice you mentioned no coconut oil.  Thoughts on caprylic acid triglycerides from coconut oil? Supposedly converts to ketones quickly.
3261 2018-08-15 17:24:09 In other news, I’ve been making/using my own beard oil for about a month now. To my bearded friends —free samples.

3265 2018-08-15 17:23:38 They did so by switching to partially hydrogenated veg oil full of trans fats. Got rid of the trans fats by 2006. Ultimately switched to a palm oil/interesterified soy blend. Could probably use more transparency wrt their palm suppliers for sustainability.
3266 2018-08-15 17:23:38 May i ask why you don't like coconut oil? Yeah, there are a couple cheeses i eat that are from soy. I also love aged cashew cheese. 
3267 2018-08-15 17:23:19 I started DIYing my own facial oil after having ZERO luck with the versions I was trying excepting the super expensive ones that were full of ingredients I could get myself for much cheaper. 
capric/caprylic triglyceride is first ingred so I bet it sinks in really nicely!
3268 2018-08-15 17:23:12 Fun fact. If you use an excessive amount of the peppermint essential oil, your shit will then have a pepperminty shit smell.

3273 2018-08-15 17:22:01 It's a NATION with no viable Tidewater options.
Think outside of your own province.
We and YOU would all reap the benefits, which could include new refineries and bitumen processing in Eastern Canada to eliminate our reliance on foreign oil.
3274 2018-08-15 17:21:56 So u and I should be believing Sriyan Pietersz and not RBI or Indian government...

3275 2018-08-15 17:21:55 Oil and water won't mix, no matter how the do-gooders try.
3276 2018-08-15 17:21:54 @JohnStossel Evereybody. Our economy is driven by oil.
3277 2018-08-15 17:21:54 Is it so much that nobody cares or that this according to a plan arrived at by the powers that be? The world was divided up much the same as the US for the Oil & health industries, to name 2.
3278 2018-08-15 17:21:48 It may just mean the bottom if it gets oil or food on it, you may still be able to tear off the top and recycle if it’s clean.

3286 2018-08-15 17:20:14 Bitcoin is rebounding right now. 10% in the last 48 hours. 

It could be because there's a glut in oil that is lowering crude prices. Gold is also falling though so I don't think that's the case.

My personal guess is dead cat bounce
3287 2018-08-15 17:20:06 copper is being nuked as well. but oil has accelerating production issues while demand ebbs.

Not ketchup
3299 2018-08-15 17:18:43 You should so that the meat doesn’t stick. I’m assuming that some don’t put oil in the pan if they have a nonstick pan, but I know people who still put oil in the pan
3300 2018-08-15 17:18:40 Elect me to the Department of Robin Hood, where the motto is: “Seizing Criminal Assets, Redistrubuting the Wealth”.  They’re also responsible for removing oil subsidies and giving  the money to environmental groups. Maybe @RepSwalwell can help.
3301 2018-08-15 17:18:37 The existing Baytown mill now employs about 260 people, up from about 100 during the oil downturn in 2015 and 2016. President Trump’s decision is hurting the US’ own employment right at home, in the heart of Texas. For further reading by @cltomlinson  in @HoustonChron +

3307 2018-08-15 17:17:31 This is what everyone doesn't seem to get, The oil is there because nature put it there millions of years ago. Its like molasses, its buried deep in the ground its not disturbing anything or anyone. Refining it here, is no different than refining anywhere else in North America
3308 2018-08-15 17:17:14 Bout to be waiting an hour and 30 for my inspection and oil change  pls tell me what I’m suppose to do with myself in all that time?

3310 2018-08-15 17:17:08 Will he though?

No one knows how Strong Megatron is. I mean his Cannon connects to a Black Hole, so his body can withstand the energy that creates. Megatron, is the opposite of Optimus, and we saw Prime throw an oil tanker at Megatron.
3311 2018-08-15 17:17:03 As @RctHoima we are hoping to convince country team to bring #REI18 19 edition team to Hoima oil city especially with oil drilling and processing expected soon.
3312 2018-08-15 17:17:02 Trying to get my oil changed on my lunch break was probably not the smartest idea
3313 2018-08-15 17:17:00 Some of the worst foods for #acidreflux that may be contributing to the problem include:

Alcohol
Carbonated beverages, sugary drinks 
Artificial sweeteners and excess sugar

3316 2018-08-15 17:16:25 Mayonnaise is mostly oil and only a very small percentage of it is egg. My guess is it's 75% to 90% oil.
3317 2018-08-15 17:16:15 I love Ramen  we just went to Koreatown on a Ramen shopping spree. They have the good ones with oil packets

3326 2018-08-15 17:14:28 What if Turkey invests $14-15 billion in Physical Silver and uses Silver to purchase Iranian Oil?
That way they can do a "Bunker Hunt" and punish Entities that are deliberately shorting Silver.

3329 2018-08-15 17:14:02 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3330 2018-08-15 17:13:59 I literally never ate mayo until very recently when I started making my own using avocado oil in place of canola or soy as is typically found in store bought brands and I don't add sugar. Turns out I love it when it is just - actual mayo and not mayo + bull shit

3349 2018-08-15 17:12:03 Qatar only has about 15 yrs of oil left.  This is a bid to get Turkey to hell with the blockade

What have I become?
3352 2018-08-15 17:11:59 Which oil?
3353 2018-08-15 17:11:57 Yeah I tried that last night. I read somewhere saying to put petroleum jelly around your cuticles, I used coconut oil on one hand and I think it cemented it on my nails.. didn't use it one the other and it came right off!

3362 2018-08-15 17:10:45 You can pop balloons using the oil from orange peel
3363 2018-08-15 17:10:41 I read the article-sounds like socialism (price controls, currency limits and nationalism) is the distinguishing characteristic between Venezuela and other oil countries that have survived this oil price drop just fine (ie the gulf states)
3364 2018-08-15 17:10:39 That first shirt looks like a holographic oil stain put through a bunch of filters
3365 2018-08-15 17:10:28 AlMansoori, the production company contracted by Tullow was slatted to be back on operations before the weekend but that will not happen.
Hence, oil transportation will NOT resume this week.

3374 2018-08-15 17:09:16 WTI oil $66.35/barrel, -$0.68 due in part to a gloomier global economic outlook and a report of rising U.S. crude supplies.

3382 2018-08-15 17:08:34 Feels like a more apt description would be he's a snake oil salesmen. He did a good job being likeable and charming, it's why he built up a fan base. But at the end of it all he was just a charlatan, like a charming fraud completely out of his depth working at IGN.
3383 2018-08-15 17:08:27 It really just smells like someone just squeezed some lemons into the bottle. People actually pay an absurd price for these essential oil thingy
3384 2018-08-15 17:08:25 no idea if putting tanning oil on after sunscreen is beneficial for my tan or health but oh well
3385 2018-08-15 17:08:24 You ignoramus. The country was also built on whale oil, actual horsepower, and telegrams — none of which play much of a role in our economy today. To say the country was “built” on tariffs is like saying the Taj Mahal was built by elephants. So what?
3386 2018-08-15 17:08:19 I honestly dont care were the ministers are, what matter to me is their records, what they achieved when in charge of 9ja. Its on record that your co-ordinating minister co-ordinated the 9ja economy into recession at the time d price of oil was the highest in decades

3398 2018-08-15 17:06:51 Copper's just starting too as is oil.  The BIS and the Boyz have taken the haven out of safe haven.  Right it has neither gone up, or stopped going down.  I know it has to end, but so far this manipulation has been engineered quite well.  I think tech ever crashes then rotation

My answer: Because, there is no oil in Zimbabwe.
3415 2018-08-15 17:04:55 Right ! And the good he does is always hush hush.. 

How many tines have you heard all the good he has done starting with the Keystone pipeline?!?

3422 2018-08-15 17:04:20 Inasmuch as there was hype and quickness from governments side for Tullow Oil operations to start, the local politicians and the community, as large feel, the deal was only between the government and its client, Tullow. There's still some resistance from the later.

3467 2018-08-15 16:59:27 Denmark has some of the most free capital markets in the world. Even unions are very pro market in Denmark. Norway uses the capitalist energy markets (oil) to fund programs. Both are far from Socialist countries.

3479 2018-08-15 16:58:13 Could have been worse for the blind oil longs. They could have been long copper instead lol. Still more to go in my opinion.
3480 2018-08-15 16:58:12 Not as long as they are not using taxpayer money to do so and loopholes allow them not to pay their fair share.  Like why do we subsidize oil companies.  That is the most ridiculous thing and it should be stopped.
3481 2018-08-15 16:58:12 The obvious play would be Enstrom the problem with him is he gets hurt. Only played 70+ games twice in the last seven years.

3496 2018-08-15 16:56:01 Yeah mind blowing, I think it’s because the country sits on top of one of the world’s largest oil reserves, gasoline has been made effectively free as a “Venezuelan birthright“. Despite the country’s economic woes, the price remains dirt cheap.
3497 2018-08-15 16:55:41 Who do you think the Oil should sign? Do they take a chance on a player like Enstrom or Franson?  Bring in Davidson on a PTO? Sign a vet like Bieksa?

3566 2018-08-15 16:47:39 Make sure it does not contain palm oil.
3567 2018-08-15 16:47:35 I've learned that you cannot grow while being bitter.

3568 2018-08-15 16:47:28 I came to get an oil change and he trying to tell me all this other stuff that’s wrong... we’ll worry about that a different day

3576 2018-08-15 16:46:19 The barista just added MCT oil into my double espresso for my workout, i’m not sleeping tonight then.
3577 2018-08-15 16:46:02 Lol. Hata bei ya mkate na maziwa itapanda bro. Reason? Price of oil and inflation have a cause and effect relationship.
3578 2018-08-15 16:46:01 A lot of health/wellness YouTubers I follow have recently come out saying something to the effect of "I've been suffering from an eating disorder this whole time" or "I have exercise bulimia" etc., and I don't know whether to relate or be mad that I bought the snake oil.

3581 2018-08-15 16:45:57 How about Dec. Brent breaking the rectangle? Would that be a confirmation oil is following China and copper from now on?
3582 2018-08-15 16:45:48 Well, getting my oil change and I realize that I’m watching some weird video with what I think is the volume all the way down...then I realize my phone still hooked up to my car Bluetooth and the guy is driving it...I’m so sorry if you just heard anything weird dude
3583 2018-08-15 16:45:19 BB been in need of a oil change too
3584 2018-08-15 16:45:15 … or quietly manage production so that oil revenue is maintained for as long as possible
3585 2018-08-15 16:45:03 I want president Buhari and Julius berger to relocate to niger delta and develop it like abuja. Abuja has no oil but look at how developed it is how much more should the niger delta look like....super developed
3586 2018-08-15 16:45:02 @chrissyteigen @johnlegend New Mexico needs more help with making sure we elect a Democratic Governor. The Republican is getting deep pocket money from oil and tobacco company’s. We are 50th in education. We need support in any way!
3587 2018-08-15 16:44:52 Y’all don’t understand how much work it is maintaining your own locs gahhh I just wanna cut this shit off today. I gotta do/make a hot oil treatment and everything ughhh. Im definitely not doing rods, going with lazy crinkles.
3588 2018-08-15 16:44:36 Hayi. First they introduced a “ministry of religion”, then the whole social media tax thing, now car owners must re-register their cars (and pay money of course) for no proper reason.
I’m not sure why people haven’t thrown tubs of coconut oil at the state house yet.

3592 2018-08-15 16:44:16 Want real energy independence?
1. Restore CAFE targets. Don't need as much, don't use as much,  less dependency.
2. That also reduces the price, forcing countries with unbound oil to pump more of it.
3.  Tax it.  If it costs more, you don't use as much, and are less dependent.

3600 2018-08-15 16:43:28 Sure it does at the moment because we use a lot more oil and gas than we do solar and wind.  Imagine what that chart looks like if we are 100% solar and wind

3625 2018-08-15 16:40:44 You need a full spectrum, 60% active molecule tincture oil. Also make sure they have updated labs results and ask how it is extracted. Super critical co2 is better than chemical extraction

3630 2018-08-15 16:40:23 Closing the trade gap, particularly by reducing import from China, will ease their demands on oil and reduce the money they have for military buildup.

3634 2018-08-15 16:40:02 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3635 2018-08-15 16:40:01 yeah that's how i am rn.. stopped taking it for a few days and yesterday i think i was experiencing withdrawal symptoms and it was really bad.. so here i am taking it again just to feel normal lol. def gonna try the cbd oil!!

I don't want CBD oil or sativex.
I just want a 9 plant lisence to find my own thc/cbd,v etc profile.
3637 2018-08-15 16:39:47 the strands of faith line works really well for me but i’ve heard the jamaican black castor oil line from shea moisture is good too! as long as you use a leave in, oil, and moisturizer you should be good

And no pesky oil spills!
3641 2018-08-15 16:39:42 I just started using your CBD oil last week for my severe anxiety & chronic pain. I am extremely happy & amazed at how well it's working. I highly recommend your CBD. I would be happy to give you a shout out if any1 asks where I get it !

3646 2018-08-15 16:39:11 Looks great, But yeah, I'm not going to invest that much time into painting it. Black prime, heavy dark grey drybrush, oil wash, dawnstone drybrush and maybe a light tyrant skull drybrush.

3652 2018-08-15 16:38:24 yeah i don’t think all the time. i think after maybe 3 uses, you should toss it or once there’s too much food debris from previous use. whichever comes first. i don’t save any oil i cook seafood in.

3654 2018-08-15 16:38:21 i love it when it’s 36 degrees out because i can’t take my small, black haired dog out for fear he will literally collapse from heat stroke if he goes on more than a 10 min walk.

fuck an oil industry
3655 2018-08-15 16:38:07 Are you saying that an oil field is movable' property?
3656 2018-08-15 16:38:07 It wasn't easy for MMS either. 140$ crude oil , all time high gold price. Biggest imports were very expensive. Opposition/Media was all running negative propaganda. Global condition is recent but India too has its own problems. CAD is widening even with low crude price.
3657 2018-08-15 16:37:53 I do almost every night lol. I buy them at wegs already cut in half then toss them lightly in wegmans seasoned basting oil along w a lil garlic salt and pepper. Then roast them in the oven till crispy. Yum

Yes he's sick and not healthy, at least I'm seeing heavy work going on in this country. In terms of economy, with the frequent rise in crude oil, we'll get there.
3669 2018-08-15 16:36:23 I really don't care if you take me seriously or not. I'm not spinning.

3684 2018-08-15 16:34:53 That’s what happens in countries that let Russia corrupt and compromise their political leaders.

If you are a competing oil or gas producer, if you are Russia’s neighbor, if Russia sees you as a road block ... they ruin your home if you let them.
3685 2018-08-15 16:34:33 You can use garlic oil and arnica for quite a few ailments. Garlic oil is a natural antibiotic and arnica reduces inflammation and helps the healing process.
3686 2018-08-15 16:34:28 So I think the best ways to reduce oil imports are:
1} expand home production of crude oil.
2} increase public transportation usage.
3}Improve connections at every stage of journey
4}Substitute natural gas and biomass fuel for oil.That would reduce green house emissions as well.

3700 2018-08-15 16:33:10 Do you think USDCAD Long would be a good play here, since $ is going to get stronger and CAD is US biggest oil exporter (negative correlation). It seems it would get double beating.

I insisted that if he didn't get my battery back to life and my car started that I would call my 'state trooper husband' and he'd see if the battery was really dead.
3703 2018-08-15 16:32:58 Anyone need 50:1 gas oil mix for anything
3704 2018-08-15 16:32:52 I'm about to go outside and change my own oil cause my dad refuses too and I'm not trynna pay money to get it done
3705 2018-08-15 16:32:20  I hardly eat it anymore as they use palm oil  @NutellaGlobal @PalmOilProject #makeachange #savethepanet #saynotopalmoil
3706 2018-08-15 16:32:19 It's the crowning glory of the colour red. Red connotes royalty. Groundnut oil is a learner.
3707 2018-08-15 16:32:19 19thC physician James Copland writes, “the oil with which the lamp of human…existence burns is filled at its commencement, and is never afterwards supplied...the more brilliant the flame, the shorter will be its duration.” Any recs for scholarship on the depletion of vitality?
3708 2018-08-15 16:32:14 Hi Ajan.
Yes. India expenses a large chunk on oil import. But the kind of discrimination you're suggesting wouldn't be a fair decision in my view coz most of people use private cars out of compulsion.Our public transportation system is very bad.
3709 2018-08-15 16:32:07 I knew what to do, ask some of those in the UK who support palm oil whilst claiming they act for public benefit as a charity like the Inst of Chem Eng. Guess what, they don't want to play nor offer intelligible replies, and so it goes on.
3710 2018-08-15 16:32:05 The new oil aye except oil is easier on the environment to refine
3711 2018-08-15 16:31:50 That is so awesome! Big ups to Kevin and you for execution. I think I need to try and do this for myself to get any work done. But also I kind of want an Anna Nicole Smith-type dying oil tycoon situation. & maybe I want to write about my feud with his kids. I have a lot of ideas!

3715 2018-08-15 16:31:25 use coconut oil as moisturiser and hair conditioner
3716 2018-08-15 16:31:22 He is young, ambitious, zealous and experienced. We don't need 80yrs candidates anymore, going back to farm or relying on oil & gas alone can't help us, we need innovation and technology, a president that is ready to invest on his people... Entrepreneural minded leader.

3728 2018-08-15 16:30:16 Evidence is everywhere and the people in power decide it's not what their base wants so they do nothing. 

It's boggling to me that a few simple fixes, better technology doing good this for the environment is better for everyone.

I'm a contradiction because I support oil too.
3729 2018-08-15 16:30:16 Best of luck to you & the team at Bristol.  Wishing for a clean, solid run.

3736 2018-08-15 16:29:15 @heyassante if you’re looking for a new shampoo SheaMoisture has this Jamaican black castor oil line. shampoo, conditioner (leave ins too), etc. I colored my hair and I really like the shampoo. I also use the ogx coconut milk conditioner.
3737 2018-08-15 16:29:13 He has made deals to line the pockets of his Swamp and himself. It's all about greed. He is destroying the Endangered Species Act for big oil. Zinke and Bernhardt need to be investigated.  Look at the zero-tolerance too. DeVos and her Catholic Charity are making $. 
3738 2018-08-15 16:29:09 #CrudeOil #Brentoil we are at 200 days moving average at current levels of 64.5 and 70 . We need strong supply reasons to break this levels.

3739 2018-08-15 16:29:05 Please come. I have the oil.

3752 2018-08-15 16:27:42 I take zoloft too and i just kinda hate having to take it. CBD oil helps me a lot whenever I'm feeling extra stressed, so I don't see the point in me taking my zoloft anymore, but I know I have to. I'm going to talk about it with my doctor tomorrow...

3757 2018-08-15 16:27:20 Chip What about a payment for other crops like canola? It has been affected just like the beans with the trade war. Canola trades right along with bean oil. Our farm is looking at $65/ac less with the lower prices ... 65000 in lost revenue hurts!! #agritalk
3758 2018-08-15 16:27:20 I actually hope that what appeared in the notebook 6 days ago plays out first (don't want to mention specifics here). That way we make more and tease the bull in waves while taking more of Andurand's hooker money. I know we will put it to more productive use than him.
3759 2018-08-15 16:27:19 ‘Cooked in sunflower oil’ - shite.

3766 2018-08-15 16:26:40 Still looking for the best ways to fix this in one's own diet. Taking cod liver oil and krill pills; avoiding veg oil. This makes restaurant salad dressings impossible. Grrr.
3767 2018-08-15 16:26:27 Lol because the “remaining oil life” in my car is 2%. Uhh, probably need to buy oil after work whit. 
3768 2018-08-15 16:26:27 Does not mean of sound mind and body either. Ok and now explain away how JP tells you how it's my fault you're like that because I get women and you don't Every step of the way he is scapegoating & proposing ghoulish solutions to the woes ofthese men. at best snake oil salesman
3769 2018-08-15 16:26:24 They always want to tell you the shit you don’t wanna hear about your car when all you want is an oil change lol
3770 2018-08-15 16:26:23 @Go_Rozen We know today's @EIAgov inventory report is legit because it's a government report. I mean it's not like they would try to talk down oil or create fake oil to keep the price down. Guess I'll just buy the FANG's
3771 2018-08-15 16:26:22 @biorechercheuk has a selection of masks to help regulate and control oil production for a shine free complexion all day everyday!

3775 2018-08-15 16:26:16 60 mill no good for that mission you need 60 billion DD isnt in that league. You would need an oil shiek or a Russian oligarch.Never gonna happen
3776 2018-08-15 16:26:13 I took an essential oil class last night about releasing trapped emotions.  I love essential oils so much & how helpful they are for the body & emotions
3777 2018-08-15 16:26:06 Isn’t cheese like an oil product? That’s why it melts..... like it’s a different chemical state than milk or cream. But idk. That’s just my guess.
3778 2018-08-15 16:25:52 Did you know that Alberta and Saskatchewan produce other oil outside of the oilsands?
3779 2018-08-15 16:25:45 Exactly....mash up some avocado and use it wherever you'd use mayo. You can dress it up with lemon/lime juice and olive oil.
3780 2018-08-15 16:25:43 Hmm not sure why you think ggp is over priced, it’s anything but! 6 major projects and the results so far have been great. Current market cap doesn’t even begin to value one of them. Ukog could also be on the verge of a new oil Provence for the uk, will be a 1bn co soon enough
3781 2018-08-15 16:25:40 The glue that holds is fan base together is his indignity and indecency.  It's would be naive to believe he would change that and he would frankly be stupid to do so since they're the only people buying his snake oil pills.
3782 2018-08-15 16:25:40 @newscentermaine #asknow Could someone look into why heating oil prices are about 50 cents higher this summer than last year and why they haven’t dropped at all since this past spring?  Typically go way down during summer, but not this year, wondering why... thanks!
3783 2018-08-15 16:25:28 That shot of your mini hauler says it all. I'm a fan!

3789 2018-08-15 16:24:47 just dropped off my 87 year old father’s car at a @NissanUSA dealership for oil change and 20k mile service and showed staff the keys that barely work now due to wear and theyve already started the “it must be a misuse issue” bullshit to avoid fixing them for free.  He’s 87!!!
3790 2018-08-15 16:24:41 This is the same Saudi Arabia that Musk accused of being part of an international oil conspiracy to short and damage his company? And they want to pay a 20% market premium with money they don't even really have to spend?

3798 2018-08-15 16:23:22 I wash my hair every five days and use dry shampoo in between when it gets too greasy to handle. Eventually it’ll stop producing so much excess oil if you don’t get it wet (bc water actually dries out hair/skin)
3799 2018-08-15 16:23:11 I did ask & I did not receive!! That sandwich was still dry after I requested EXTRA oil, vinegar & mayo!!

3807 2018-08-15 16:22:23 Depends on where you are. And if oil maintains the losses for the next day or two. If so, it may take a few days to start showing up at the pump.

3815 2018-08-15 16:21:55 the real story is how the protesters have done more to harm the area than the pipeline ever could. environmental activists are natures worst enemy. crying about a pipe pushing oil underground and then they destroy the land in the process of protesting the destruction of the land

3823 2018-08-15 16:21:17 It’s funny when people here i started at $16/hr just 3 years ago. Granted I had a ton of money saved up from oil field. Just needed to stay busy because I was bored at home. Turned into a career. People say you can’t live off of $16/hr. Exactly why you bust ass to get to 100k

3826 2018-08-15 16:21:06 Subrealist idea, because the guarantee that is intended to be based on delivery to the Central Bank of Venezuela of an oil field of the Orinoco oil belt, which belongs to the nation and is not subject to alienation and therefore can not be guarantor of payment.
3827 2018-08-15 16:21:04 My sense of “real” was compromised the moment I launched a press. The machine needs oil, I get that. Still, I’ve never understood the immediate transition to “cheap pop”-type tweeting you see coming outta folks who managed a little attention for a minute.
3828 2018-08-15 16:20:58 got everything i need for my motor except the oil pan. $152 sheeeit

3830 2018-08-15 16:20:54 Glad to see that Georfferay hasn't changed in the years since he blocked me. The sun shines, the sky is blue, and Primal Poly is edgelord who hawks snake oil to dumbasses.
3831 2018-08-15 16:20:48 Imagine if they had the power to limit oil ?
How many would have to starve or die before they realized it’s all interconnected ?
Reducing population and over consumption is the only way to lessen demand
So many of us depend on Oil .
Fertilizer and farming uses much of it
3832 2018-08-15 16:20:44 And yet countries with those oil reserves always end up being shitholes regardless, don't they? Lots of money doesn't always mean it's used properly.

3836 2018-08-15 16:20:13 @jontester @obama proud to be responsible for lowest oil production, highest oil prices, highest gasoline prices, highest oil imports in America.  Largest drop in oil consumption of 3 million barrels daily or 14%.  Lowest rig count for over 40 years. #mtpol #prosperity #maga
3837 2018-08-15 16:19:55 Good luck tomorrow night. This will be a great race for you and everyone on board. I hope you continue to do things like this for the fans
3838 2018-08-15 16:19:54 Washing up liquid plus a little bit of water. Without the water the detergent has nothing to lift the oil “into”. Good luck :)
3839 2018-08-15 16:19:53 Have you thought about trying CBD Oil? If so, what for?
3840 2018-08-15 16:19:46 Say what you will but this is the result of idiot legislators interfering in the primary process by which bona fides are affirmed by the constituency.
They made their bed by placing a person over party and are now sleeping in it.
3841 2018-08-15 16:19:41 $TSLA
Just months ago Tesla Longs we're going on about how evil Good man Sachs was, and the big oil conspiracy against Tesla. My how things change fast.
3842 2018-08-15 16:19:39 If you ate 4,000 calories in dirt a day, would you lose or gain weight? How about 4,000 calories in motor oil?
3843 2018-08-15 16:19:33 Saw that, bad joke. That's a reason I hate to let anyone else change oil on anything.
3844 2018-08-15 16:19:17 it's such racism...if he cared about freeloading he'd be concerned about dirty energy having been on welfare for a century (to the tune of trillions of infl.-adjusted $$$). Did he buy his own oil refinery? Oh right, taxpayer welfare built nuclear & oil infrastructure...
3845 2018-08-15 16:19:14 And he changes my oil for FREE
3846 2018-08-15 16:19:11 Make a peppermint oil inhalant...
3847 2018-08-15 16:19:07 63.96 on October Crude Oil Futures is a strong daily support going back to June/August 2017. Covered remaining short there, went long with a tight stop. Been waiting for this buy level for weeks.
3848 2018-08-15 16:19:05 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

3854 2018-08-15 16:18:26 Congrats to Jamie Porter on his new role w/ @EdmOilKings! Another good one lands in Oil Country. Kirt Hill is assembling quite the crew.
3855 2018-08-15 16:18:22 No more oil spills!
3856 2018-08-15 16:18:18 10時に寝たら今起きた（なんのギャグだ？）
3857 2018-08-15 16:18:17 I don’t know if I’d go that far. Dredd character arcs are very much an imperceptible changes to the course of an oil tanker kind of thing. Also Hershey is still the pragmatist and he’s still the purist. But now every time he does a Grantist thing there will be ...doubt.
3858 2018-08-15 16:18:14 It runs in the engine oil. Looks to me the last person to change oil in it screwed it up.
3859 2018-08-15 16:18:12 I wish they would do more studies on CBD oil.
3860 2018-08-15 16:18:12 They were the wealthiest country in South America at one point. They've got massive oil reserves, after all.
3861 2018-08-15 16:18:06 One difference is that Japan decided to rely on buying oil on the open market, not controlling it directly (learned a hard lesson circa 1945). China’s behavior in Africa, naval buildup, and attempts to get off USD imply that they want direct oil access.
3862 2018-08-15 16:17:58 They'll ban him from enter a whole foods. Anyways why does he even have a membership there since he hates anything organic or vegan but only likes the snake oil supplements he sells on his website?
3863 2018-08-15 16:17:50 E oil makes me break out and it makes me oily all day
3864 2018-08-15 16:17:40 Who cares about depth Darcy, just keep plugging guys into spots their skill set and/or experience tells us they don't belong in and hope for the best, lol. Rinse and repeat my friend, rinse and repeat 
3865 2018-08-15 16:17:38 @PervGriffin   So I take drop of cbd oil in morning and at4:00 pm. Put under tongue. Drug free baby. No more pain clinic! Fuck em'
3866 2018-08-15 16:17:34 Mr jawar Mohammed stop putting oil on the fire this is fitna the oromo in Djibouti living in peace nd security some of them may left the country but the majority rest ,we share blood nd religion nd culture we r brothers .

3868 2018-08-15 16:16:46  अब सोया हुआ indian oil भी चुनावी वक़्त में जाग गया है ।। अब तक कहाँ थे ?
3869 2018-08-15 16:16:36 I'm against this. But if they actually do this I hope they plant a dozen or so right near Mar-a-Lago. Trump loves oil rigs I'm sure! lol  ( He hated the wind mills in Scotland and Ireland and said so)
3870 2018-08-15 16:16:33 Obama had a non-lethal weapon in fracking to cower Russia by driving the price of oil into the ground and cutting US need to import, but refused to use it and regulated it to death. His alternative approach was to tank the recovery so oil use was lowered causing lower oil prices.
3871 2018-08-15 16:16:30 Top brands come from fish or krill. Oil. & have no added suspect vegetable oils. Read labels carefully as a very small amount of toxins can set off an inflammatory reaction. For examples Adults usually don’t need iron. iron can build up and be extremely toxic and inflammatory.
3872 2018-08-15 16:16:21 Trump told NATO ally Turkey to release the American pastor & had the means to follow through.
Trudeau told Saudi Arabia to release their activists, they halt relations with Canada except the sale of their oil, Trudeau continues to buy Saudi oil while abandoning our own.

3873 2018-08-15 16:16:17 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
3874 2018-08-15 16:16:15  we break the 200 day this week
3875 2018-08-15 16:16:12 People generally take a higher dosage of CBD oil to help them sleep. As you are using sleep medication as well, your body may show some resistance if you are transitioning away from it.  glad to hear you are feeling more rested hope it will help

3878 2018-08-15 16:15:51 Dove Shampoo & Conditioner, for moisturising,I use coconut oil.
3879 2018-08-15 16:15:48 can't really taste the butter, it just makes it creamy and a bit frothy but you have to WHIP it, i had to use my nutribullet, I've done it with coconut oil too. but i prefer coconut sugar and pea milk! hahaha!

3882 2018-08-15 16:15:32 At Pep Boys waiting for my oil to get changed. This random lady walks up to me and says “I got poison and it’s driving me crazy” and walks away....? Uhm okay
3883 2018-08-15 16:15:31 I NEED to go back to chicago soon I miss my kitchen, i haven't had a vegetable not coated in oil or cheese in a week,  and I just googled "lightwieght eugenicists"
3884 2018-08-15 16:15:25 คุยกับพี่แล้ว รู้สึกดีขึ้นเยอะ
3885 2018-08-15 16:15:20 omg i’m so happy for you! i’m natural and i never pre poo but for some reason i’m inclined to do it this weekend. i plan on letting coconut oil sit overnight before i wash. i don’t use natural ingredients i use store bought stuff
3886 2018-08-15 16:15:06 I understand the feelings about being a team player, though. Especially with our given circumstances. @TomPerez wants to take money from big oil again...so while idealistic, there is still right and wrong.
3887 2018-08-15 16:15:05 it's our only answer, start now
3888 2018-08-15 16:15:00 Republicans believe in socialism too— under paid workers subsidized by government programs, subsidies to oil and gas, big bank bailouts, tax loopholes & war industry spending.
3889 2018-08-15 16:14:52 Love conquers all, I Cry over all the Muslims in this world that lost their lives over oil or  Natural Gas, Trump is actually for the American people but he also hasn't forgot the Muslims in their countries. The world needs to know
3890 2018-08-15 16:14:44 1000% BULLSHIT and fake news. Those people have no link w terrorism or money laundering, sanctions are purely political. From 2017 illegal US sanctions are LITERALLY starving Venezuela, making it impossible for the country to recover from the 2014 oil crash. It's a war crime
3891 2018-08-15 16:14:15 Lads clickbait is a terrible thing...my grandmother is just casually blaring a “Things they didn’t tell you about coconut oil” video in the living room and they’re telling her to shove the stuff up her nostrils...mad world.
3892 2018-08-15 16:14:12 If you have cancer. Do sublingual cannabis tincture, swallow canna oil caps, do suppositories, vape it, rub on your skin. And make sure there’s plenty of CBD in your formulations 1:1 THC/CBD is important. Along with full spectrum of all other cannabinoids
3893 2018-08-15 16:14:09 In that paper, the mice were fed with Crisco and corn oil.
3894 2018-08-15 16:14:06 Today’s hang over recovery brought to you by ice cold water, ibuprofen, and peppermint oil. 
3895 2018-08-15 16:14:01 did they land?
3896 2018-08-15 16:13:54 I'm so happy this morning because my CBD oil care package is getting sent to my boyfriend's parents in Tennesee today. Dad has prostate cancer (stage 4), Mom has fibro.

I'm hoping this will help them even a little, it's tough being far away 
3897 2018-08-15 16:13:52 Great news for the whole country, lets see them how they will react at the oil field 10!Maybe was a tactical maneuver from him in believing that are changing towards us,l, keep the armed forces on alert, working closely with our allies can have a better result,too much money !
3898 2018-08-15 16:13:49 Oil order today! I’m just shy of my goal, if you aren’t near me, I’ll cover shipping to your house! Today only. 
3899 2018-08-15 16:13:45 @OurKate_Oil Big day tomorrow...
Fingers crossed for your A Level Results tomorrow 
3900 2018-08-15 16:13:29 Darn,some people won't do their job with their best ability can be devastating.I'll never go to @Walmart to change oil again. 
This irresponsible man who changed my oil in my car forgot to put the lid back on and made my car in a mess situation.Aggravating and devastating.

3904 2018-08-15 16:12:57 I really miss them days when I was kid not young anymore, I remember one day we were running out body lotion then my mom lotioned my skin by using cooking oil there after I cried a lot then I asked her what type of vegetable am I.? but she remained silence
3905 2018-08-15 16:12:54 My next expensive oil purchase will be vanilla. I’m also going to get some more rose oil, it’s truly divine.
3906 2018-08-15 16:12:49 God bless and good luck. Olive leaf and castor oil packs definitely help with a liver detox bc that helps after kemo I hear.
3907 2018-08-15 16:12:48 Amazing how criteria changes. Teenage me: He has dark hair and eyes, cool hair, Jordan Catalano-ish, nice shoulders, cute butt, listens to Depeche Mode & Pearl Jam & Midnight Oil, tall, musician, etc. Modern me: is he straight? Actually single? Kind? Employed? Has actual morals?

3912 2018-08-15 16:12:15 Where as you're just giving it to the 1% here in this country and to Putin, via steel, oil and asbestos? The rest of US citizens are getting  nothing.

3916 2018-08-15 16:11:45 somehow I have to think about Oil Panic :)
3917 2018-08-15 16:11:44 Mike kept the car alive by force of wrench and will. Years under the hood-- 287,000 hard won miles. "Nowadays they're all computers," he lamented. "Y'can't even check your own oil!" She #belched up a cloud of exhaust. "Hang in there ol' girl. I'll getcha to 300,000!" #vss365
3918 2018-08-15 16:11:34 Tariffs were also connected to the Great Depression. Careful what you are buying from this snake oil salesman. He’s willing to tank western alliances to help Russia

3926 2018-08-15 16:10:42 moderate conservatives like character-building competition between fossil fuels and "alternatives". more radical conservatives might be more ok with the funny-headless-chicken type of character-building that destruction of oil companies might bring.
3927 2018-08-15 16:10:39 Why are other oil jurisdictions doing fine then.
3928 2018-08-15 16:10:35 The level of carb and and what type of oil is crucial .

3937 2018-08-15 16:09:58 Why is the Trump administration in dogged pursuit of normalized relations with Russia that includes lifting of sanctions. Two reasons, 1) oil and money 2) to reciprocate for the help Russia gave Trump during the campaign.
3938 2018-08-15 16:09:40 Oh Jesus you people always bring  up Venezuela. Terrible example as we have gotten involved too much with them because we want their oil. Progressives are talking about Canada, The UK, and Scandinavian countries who have a better health care system than we do.
3939 2018-08-15 16:09:26 อ่าาาา
3940 2018-08-15 16:09:23 Told Steph last night I was taking the car to get an oil change today so she needed to leave me the car keys...she dents me a text this morning saying "don't forget to get the oil change" but she forgot to leave the keys  #chroniclesofcking

3949 2018-08-15 16:08:26 It probably wouldn't have worked, but imagine if the British had lumped Saudi Arabia with Egypt. The impoverished masses of Egypt would have shared that oil wealth, instead of just the sparse population of the Arabian peninsula.

My "thought process" is it's ... literally a well. 
3972 2018-08-15 16:07:14 @Varneyco Every day you guys ROOT for high oil prices; NOW you root for low gasoline prices? You guys are supposed to be economists. You do know you can't have both. Stop trying to relate to the common man. We need LOW gas prices!

3975 2018-08-15 16:07:07 Yep, I added today at 10.88, will add again if it drops below that - confident it’ll be much higher when we get oil shows
3976 2018-08-15 16:06:52 I THINK I just checked the oil in my car correctly #grown
3977 2018-08-15 16:06:50 BC can sure give us their smoke, but we can't give them our oil..
3978 2018-08-15 16:06:42 Lol...yeah, just b/c soneone gives a guy the title, doesn't make him one. (also see No. 1 goalie, 1st line C and top pairing D-man) 
3979 2018-08-15 16:06:36 @LushLtd When will you be restocking Jason and the argon oil shampoo bar?
3980 2018-08-15 16:06:27 Boleh je but I'd suggest to dab your face lightly with tissue to get rid of excess oil or sweat sebelum reapply.

3983 2018-08-15 16:06:14 Crude Oil down by 3%....., is it time to be cautious in the market?????

3985 2018-08-15 16:06:12 11. Langkah pertama yg paling fundamental adalah memproduksi liquid fuel dg memaksimalkan sumberdaya non oil dalam negeri.Gas to liquid(GTL) , Coal to liquid (CTL) , bio fuel . Fokus pada nilai strategis kebijakan ini jg sampai terjebak pada keekonomian.
3986 2018-08-15 16:06:12 Copper down 4%.
Silver down 4%
Platinum down 4% - now well below $800 at $766
Palladium down 5.7%
Oil down 3%
US$ at a 13-month high.
3987 2018-08-15 16:06:03 Yes, & denouncing #DNC flip-flop on taking #oil & gas corporate $ while saying the #climate movement still has to #GOTV for #Dems is also not a winner.

3989 2018-08-15 16:05:54 Have you been smoking on that echo oil? Shit is fire. I like it just as much as dirty arm farm if not more
3990 2018-08-15 16:05:51 Maybe I’ll go back to my organic coconut oil 
3991 2018-08-15 16:05:44 Good luck Jordan.  My thoughts are with you and the team.,

3993 2018-08-15 16:05:38 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3994 2018-08-15 16:05:37 If we truly embraced the idea of being energy independent and stop most imports of oil it would go along way to a secured market and job stability out West to avoid boom and bust cycles. Western Canada has almost no access to our own countries largest market.

4002 2018-08-15 16:05:25 Sekera returned too early last year and played poorly. Maybe this ends up being a good thing for the Oil
4003 2018-08-15 16:05:23 If it's not leaking gas or oil, try the alternator. A lot of times that is what causes the "seems to be working and then stops" issue.

4005 2018-08-15 16:05:15 In dying need of an oil change. I’m 10,000 miles over. I just keep putting bottled oil in there lol.
4006 2018-08-15 16:05:13 Buy lavender essential oil and use that next time you bathe/shower.
4007 2018-08-15 16:05:11 I fixed the AC in my car... So now I have an oil leak, coolant leak, idle problem, need a new rack/pinion, and the AC at work has shut down. Third car that fixing the AC has broken everything in the world so I'm going to stop ever fixing car AC units and just deal with the heat.
4008 2018-08-15 16:05:08 The only reason it won the last election is because of Harper's reluctance to do anything other than develop oil in the west while manufacturing in the east was dying. His time was up. Circumstances are very different and that swing vote is gone for the Liberals. Too far left.
4009 2018-08-15 16:05:05 Our alliance with Saudi Arabia gets us nothing but oil access and complicity in their war crimes. We share no common values.
4010 2018-08-15 16:04:49 Need to look for a new “light” oil to use in my hair

And if this energy or spirit travels up the spine, how is the oil at the base of the spine supposed to hit your gland for enlightenment?

4021 2018-08-15 16:03:54 Sheen khalai is not tribe name. Sheen mean green khalai mean girl with tattoo. It can be made with injecting kohl (surma) with oil.
4022 2018-08-15 16:03:35 Obviously the Panthers ones are for oil rags
4023 2018-08-15 16:03:35 Climatechange is not fake. Only 0.7% of all scientists in this field denying the human made climate change. And of these 0.7% most grt their research money from oil companies...
4024 2018-08-15 16:03:34 Mine was car stuff... Changing tires, oil changes, etc. Until I got divorced and realized if I don't do it no one will!
4025 2018-08-15 16:03:31 As strange as it might sound, I've heard some people muscle test to see what their body needs to heal it most quickly & effectively. High doses of liposomal vitamin C, peppermint essential oil, are just some ideas I've heard. Best to determine the cause to identify the treatment.
4026 2018-08-15 16:03:26 got up at 6 for yoga, got my cars oil change and detailed , went grocery shopping, just left my personal trainer, now off to cut some hair  adulting is fun when you love your life.

4029 2018-08-15 16:02:59 avocado oil mayo is the popular front
4030 2018-08-15 16:02:57 The whole Canadian economy is dependant on petroleum production so much so that our currency is tied at the hip with oil prices. Instead of embracing this we are bound and determined to get away from oil and gas production even if it means damaging our economy. Senseless.
4031 2018-08-15 16:02:41 When you don’t have lemons to add to your water ... but you understand the health benefits it provides ... you bring out the essential oil and add a drop ...

4035 2018-08-15 16:02:18 Bryce: "The real issue is our dependence on oil and fossil fuels. That’s what I see our major problem is. We need to find an alternative source." You're fighting the wrong fight. Maybe inform people that do not understand climate change, you act like he put the pipeline in.

4087 2018-08-15 15:57:07 That actually sounds like a good non-profit to start. I know they have something like that in Sacramento. Maybe you should. Foster kids tend to be ignored by a lot of people. Not out of callousness but just because they don't think about it.

I'd donate to it.

4122 2018-08-15 15:54:11 So what can we do to stop the palm oil industry?
4123 2018-08-15 15:54:03 This is the 3rd time I’ve gone to get an oil change and they’ve told me my oil is too low not to replenish it but not low enough to charge me for it and this might just be my move from here on out

4175 2018-08-15 15:49:11 A carrier oil is very important as essential oils are extremely concentrated . Jojoba is also another oil but I like almond the best. What type of oil are you adding , an ounce of carrier to 8 to 10 drops of essential is usually what I use when I make up some to have on hand.

4193 2018-08-15 15:47:52 The change will happen because it is in best interest. The issue is the rate of change with fossil fuel industry still heavily lobbied. In USA it will be very slow as oil/gas companies divest more carbon heavy fuels and diversify to cleaner options.

4200 2018-08-15 15:47:19 Most of Southern N Sea is English. Central and Northern N Sea, Moray Firth, West of Shetland, & Atlantic Frontier are Scottish.

4202 2018-08-15 15:47:08 The carbon footprint of foreign oil doesn’t line the pockets of our liberal politicians. Canada’s most flagrant tax grab is based on suzukiology which is mostly religion with a dash of statistics and pictures of emancipated polar bears.

4234 2018-08-15 15:44:16 I thought we covered this. The benefit of sending them money is that they send us oil. If we illegalize import of oil from petro states, the price of oil goes up. Plus we destabilize the Saudis, and if you think there isn't something worse waiting in the wings, you're wrong.

4251 2018-08-15 15:43:13 You seem to be arguing with yourself, nobody is saying electric cars are not the future, I look forward to that time and I hope they are cheaper to run but I doubt that very much, the original discussion was about oil being an asset, it is.
4252 2018-08-15 15:43:10 Glad I stopped at the grocery before I got to the oil change place and picked up something small for breakfast. I have had coffee and ibuprofen for a bear of a headache. Hangry on top of boredom would make for an even more miserable morning.

4256 2018-08-15 15:42:15 The Oilers are a perfect case study for a team like the Maple Leafs to ensure they don't make the same mistakes.
4257 2018-08-15 15:42:11 You touched on this point, but weren't direct on it. For the Oil to have a rebound year, Klef, Lars & Nurse would have to hit top of their games & be solid top 3.  Meaning Sek was a #4 slot at best.  Also I think it IS time for a few yg you listed to step up too.
4258 2018-08-15 15:42:10 Yeaa olive oil

4271 2018-08-15 15:41:37 Wegmans subs are a must. Also Pastabilities Hot Oil and some fresh loaf make for perfect quick snacks that provide a nice base for all that heady beer. Everything in the bakery and prepared foods section is good. The Buffalo Wing Dip is highly recommended.

4293 2018-08-15 15:40:10 Better sell that oil and gas while they still can at $65 before prices collapse and then at least they will own Turkey if nothing else
4294 2018-08-15 15:40:10 The oil producers are having high hopes again to inflate the oil prices up to US$150 per barrel. Such dreams are fed by the military escalation against Iran, and cut of Saudi oil production. War will not happen. Prices will not break that 150 barrier.

4304 2018-08-15 15:39:08 Amarosa has been proved multiple times to be duplicitous and a liar, yet you still believe her?

You wouldn't perhaps be interested in buying some snake oil, would you? Cures all that ails you! Only $100 a bottle!
4305 2018-08-15 15:39:06 I like putting a bit of olive oil in there

4307 2018-08-15 15:39:00 Then your anxiety may be of a finer vintage but when it comes to good old fashioned terror at facing reality I think horses are the victors of the animal world. Humans have high quality barrels of anxiety but every horse is an oil barge overflowing
4308 2018-08-15 15:38:56 OF COURSE the Dems colluded on this little plan to STEAL our judicial seat. NC Dems are some of the dirtiest players on the field. Their successful voter fraud in 2016 is the ONLY reason Roy Cooper is governor today. (Yes, Durham Co, we KNOW what you did there!!)

4313 2018-08-15 15:38:44 the Oilsands doesn't look anything like this, but I'll bet you have never been there. btw if your anti oil, I hope you don't drive a car, heat your house etc..., AB is producing oil under the strictest environmental guidelines in the world...

4321 2018-08-15 15:37:55 Idk  all I know is Christianity has been proved to be wrong countless times and it is used more so to justify hate than anything else u can't spell war with out religion or oil
4322 2018-08-15 15:37:49 Firstly, hostilities  in Niger Delta was poorly managed and earnings from crude oil fell to almost zero untill VP met with the militants when the president went on medical vacation. Secondly, we did not have cabinet nor economic team in place for six months to oversee the economy

4325 2018-08-15 15:37:18 I’m sorry for all my tweets! I’m not sure if you heard this but frankincense oil has been said to fight cancer cells. People apply it to their scalp or the bottoms of their feet- that’s where you have the biggest pores! I use the doTerra brand & sometimes I drink a drop of it!

4333 2018-08-15 15:36:45 Not only will an indy Scotland have the taxes from gas and oil. If rUK still want all the electricity, gas, oil & water that goes south right for free, they'll have to pay the going rate for it - further boosting our economy.
4334 2018-08-15 15:36:44 Such allocation will be perceived by oil producing states as a shortchanged because they are not going to be given anything in return
4335 2018-08-15 15:36:37 I could take my astrology study to the next level and be successful with this accidental hair oil I created for scalp conditions but my motivation is some bullshit.

4341 2018-08-15 15:36:23 Exactly right. How on earth can anyone claim that something costing £11b/yr is free?
Also; "70 years peace in Europe", it wasn't the EU that stopped the USSR attacking their neighbours during the cold war.  
The EU are no better than snake oil salesmen.
4342 2018-08-15 15:36:22 Russia = oil/gas. Nothing more. No industry (except military), no plans for future development. Just bribes, mafia and vodka. Shame on leaders such a superb country. 
Regular people (and art) are really great! It is really strange feeling: to love and to hate at the same time.
4343 2018-08-15 15:36:18 Thirdly, we had poor Forex management which sent foreign investors away and crashed the economy. This would have been avoided if we had sound managers managing our economy at the early stages of this govt. Yes, we would have had slowed economic growth because of oil price crash.

4346 2018-08-15 15:36:15 Every thing you buy eat or touch in modern life is hooked to Oil .
Ppl support it bc it supports them .
Change the quantity of ppl using it and you will see a reduction.
Sue the ppl making it and you’ll just make lawyers rich.
4347 2018-08-15 15:36:02 Imo, irrevocably raising the temperature of the planet with our current oil reserves is bad, but who is to say if raising it even more is also bad

4350 2018-08-15 15:36:00 Nothing new about US presidents' kissing up to the bombers of the World Trade Center, the Saudi's oil wealth blinds us to their treachery.
4351 2018-08-15 15:35:52 ha well better late than never, Tom. There are so many interesting stories down there, and it's amazing to see it could be even better if they could get the oil out of the place.
4352 2018-08-15 15:35:44 BLM calls this process:  Gather operations.  Some of these horses are being run until they drop dead.  Why are they being taken off that vast land?  For what purpose:  Growing cattle only, housing development, resorts, oil drilling, mining....  Great way to destroy the land.

4383 2018-08-15 15:32:42 I take the view of the industry-wide drop in oil capex and exploration as a very rational response to oil's future growth prospects. Rather than "setting us up for an oil crunch" this an uncharacteristically forward looking decision for the industry, that will be proven correct.
4384 2018-08-15 15:32:37 Left all my herbs in Cali  i do have s smoke blend with me tho that has mugwort, lavender, skullcap, passionflower, and sandalwood oil in it if you need. It’s really good for relaxation, dreamwork, anxiety, and meditation.

4408 2018-08-15 15:29:33 Subtle propaganda.  Trying to sell hydrogen, keeping us addicted to oil, and dissing electric charging stations, all in one article.  All about a ‘possible’ technology that may be here in 3-5 years...

4415 2018-08-15 15:28:31 @bradmondonyc Hey there Guru! About a week ago I needed to get the oil out of my roots but didn't have time for a shower, I DID have alcohol wipes and I used a used a few to wipe just the root area. It seemed to work brilliantly, but is this bad for my hair??? #Help #SoMuchOil
4416 2018-08-15 15:28:29 Half of my dashboard display is out so when I start my car instead of saying “PLEASE CHANGE OIL” it just says “PLEASE CHANGE” and I was honestly not prepared for this intervention
4417 2018-08-15 15:28:27 Since the oil patch has been an integral part of the decisionmaking process, how do you figure this?
4418 2018-08-15 15:28:25 I totally get it! Some of my favorites are cauliflower drizzled with olive oil, sprinkled with salt & pepper (sometime I add shredded cheese if I’m feelin saucy ) and then baked. Baking kale into chips, delicious. Sweet potatoes or carrots with some honey and cinnamon

4421 2018-08-15 15:28:08 I’ve seen it at Whole Foods, and I’m still not sure what they use for an egg substitute. For my own use, I really like Kraft’s olive oil mayonnaise. I feel for you, shellfish is much easier to avoid than eggs.
4422 2018-08-15 15:28:03 Vat of oil?
4423 2018-08-15 15:27:55 You know what limits the ammunition you bring to the fight?Taking 20% of the oil industry money compared to the GOP’s 80%.It puts you at a perpetual loss. So not only have you not maintained the moral high ground in the minds of voters,but you’ve lost their trust AND are outspent
4424 2018-08-15 15:27:50 2... yelling 'exports keep out', and the US economy would have grown just as much if not more without tariffs. There is no underestimating the value of so much cheap oil, coal, and above immigrant labor to propel a country with a rapidly growing population forward.
4425 2018-08-15 15:27:46 also noticed since using this the amount of oil my skin produces isn’t off the scales and causing spots

4438 2018-08-15 15:26:15 I pray...Mr. Trump will not want to go into Iraq and take the oil because...the end will be that America will be into the greatest war that she has ever been in, the war that is in the scripture called “Armageddon.” It’s building to that as you and I are speaking. #Farrakhan

4442 2018-08-15 15:25:48 Well they had better- it's fulla oil.
4443 2018-08-15 15:25:46 India relied heavily on Crude Oil for which we pay in dollars. When Crude prices goes down India saves Foreign Exchange. Also, when crude prices fell govt. reduces oil prices which cools inflation etc. So as long as Crude goes down India should be happy.
4444 2018-08-15 15:25:45 BREAKING: Trump admin just announced winning bids for the biggest offshore oil lease sale in U.S. history in Gulf of Mexico at 78 million acres. High bids totaled $178 million for 144 tracts. Our reaction (1/2): “This massive, climate-killing Gulf oil lease sale is reckless..."

4453 2018-08-15 15:24:58 Hey @realDonaldTrump, that was a nasty little EIA Crude Oil Stockpile report, huh?

Why that drastic of an increase right in the middle of summer?

Tick, tick, tick........
4454 2018-08-15 15:24:50 & the fact that successive governments use our troops as a corporate terrorist army  to inflict regime-change wars facilitated to steal oil! Why aren’t they talking about our special forces captured whilst embedded with al Qaeda in Syria, who they were fighting with?!
4455 2018-08-15 15:24:50 OIL PRICES declining in response to deteriorating global economic outlook
* Price falls are part of negative feedback mechanism to stabilise economy
* Will Saudi Arabia allow automatic stabilisers to work? Or cut output in a bid to keep prices around $75?

4466 2018-08-15 15:23:40 and ISM will fall too as the oil patch is a large part of US industrial base. Again, something Ive been flagging for quite a while (oil was rather frustrating!).
4467 2018-08-15 15:23:35 Americas heartland will be part of the answer.  We are not fully leveraging the potential output.  Between food and water, we are sitting pretty good compared to the rest of the world.  In the long run, oil will become a minor commodity compared to food and water.

4476 2018-08-15 15:22:29 Genuinely, honestly, Google stuff. Whatever you need to do, there's probably several videos on YouTube for your exact model of car. Oil changes are usually super easy, and the tools you needs for those are a good starter set for... Like everything else you'll need to do.

4479 2018-08-15 15:22:21 Watch oil as well because if it continues falling then high beta credit is going to blow out again (CCCs big in Energy). When credit starts blowing out then US equities won’t be spared as in 1Q 2016

These "overdose" anecdotes are only happening because what used to be a cannabinoid-balanced product is now almost all THC. Got symptoms of excessive THC intoxication? Add back the CBD, avoid the OD.
4494 2018-08-15 15:20:43 I love that video. What an arrogant man Denis Healey was. We will win the election, oil is running out, the price is falling in 1987?????? Lies, lies and more lies.

4504 2018-08-15 15:19:57 No. But the similarities between the GOP and Dems are vast. For example. Both sides support money in politics.  Both receive much $ from big pharma, big oil and big banks, the insurance lobby.  Both heartily support the industrial war complex. Both sides push fracking world wide

4513 2018-08-15 15:19:13 I feel like as Albertans we sometimes internalize this attitude about ourselves and think we don't deserve more than rocks, hay and oil. Possibly an insight into the Edmontonian "what we have is just fine" preservation of the status quo.
4514 2018-08-15 15:19:07 Hi Darrel, I understand that you are concerned about the fuel prices in your area  and that seeing this 1p rise must be frustrating. Our prices do closely track the crude oil price but there are other factors involved in local price.

4517 2018-08-15 15:18:38 I think the main reason is who controlls influence of the region, oil is a part of that. It's geo politics between Turkey, Iran, Israel, Russia, EU and UDA.

4537 2018-08-15 15:16:47 It was?   Next you'll mention the oil price.

4543 2018-08-15 15:16:23 Dearest mother —
I have received your care package of sweetened chipmunk thighs, rabbit jerky and, of course, more Squirrel Oil for my bare neck. The unit continues to drill in basic as the Raven men near. Soon, we shall be able to hear their shrill calls approaching.

4545 2018-08-15 15:16:12 I have a really deep visceral loathing for all those oil and egg things. Don't know why, but can't eat them.
4546 2018-08-15 15:16:05 The regime does not care for this part of Syria for decades. Just for collecting oil. All attention was for west syria. Why do you think there was much support for #IS or #YPG?
4547 2018-08-15 15:16:05 They fucking do! My cousin went in for an oil change and "they found" a list of things that needed a change/fix and gave her a $900 bill. She called my uncle and asked if that made sense and he showed up ready to swing

4555 2018-08-15 15:15:31 "Oil"  hence the Africa Korps as well.  Hence the diversion from Moscow to neutralize bombing of Romania from Crimea.  Hence heading to the Caucasus via Stalingrad.
4556 2018-08-15 15:15:23 Oil down $2.30 today. I’m sure that will be reflected in the price at the pump right?  Sigh
4557 2018-08-15 15:15:14 More oil was needed. It looks all onion onion  with no sign of oil.

BC doesn't want our oil, our pipeline (because it might cause an environmental disaster) eh, but its okay to raw untreated sewage into the ocean,  and it's okay to not manage your forests  properly to at least try to lessen this

4572 2018-08-15 15:13:25 Ooo thank youuuu. How do you cook your curries without oil tho??? And I was thinking to swap white for brown, but will it taste nice with curries?
4573 2018-08-15 15:13:22 This will be quickly bought up by big oil and will disappear.
4574 2018-08-15 15:13:07 Even though the entire region looks barren there is almost everything here.  Many schools & even a university, a small oil refinery, godowns of FCI and construction was on for a youth hostel & open stadium. These are more important than touristy development

4586 2018-08-15 15:12:13 Of course I'm concerned about the impact of Brexit.  I care about my country, and I don't have spare dosh to pay for the new 'luxuries', like citrus fruit, olive oil, nuts.

4591 2018-08-15 15:12:05 I wouldn't class myself as a gym fanatic, but I do work out. I just cook my curries without any oil, swap the white rice for brown rice, cut down on the rice portion size & have a side salad or a side of steamed vegetables
4592 2018-08-15 15:12:04 I WILL VOTE for candidates who support MFA, who reject money from Big Oil and Banksters, and who support tuition-free public university for all.

I WILL NOT VOTE for candidates who tell us those things are ponies.

Deal.
4593 2018-08-15 15:11:49 Worse, the Trudeau government is doing nothing to respond to the economic sanctions.  The proper response would be to restart the processes to build Energy East and commit Canada to being a major player in the global oil markets.

4595 2018-08-15 15:11:41 US is the only country out of the Paris accord. This is why Americans will loose in the near future with climate change, health issues will be on the rise, cost of oil, gasoline, electricity, farming, and achievements.
4596 2018-08-15 15:11:39 U.S. weekly oil inventory saw a build of 6.81 million barrels, far higher than expected. Takes oil down another 1% for the day, for a total loss of near -3.5%.
4597 2018-08-15 15:11:33 Roasted at 450+ degrees with olive oil and maybe parm for 30-45 mins it can be good

Even when oil was over the $100 the SNP were forecasting that revenues to the SG would not even cover the cost of the NHS: so how are they going to fund the currency reserves as well?

4604 2018-08-15 15:10:30 I would recommend the Dr Bronner's unscented baby soap and dilute it 3:1 (h2o/soap) or Cetaphil sensitive skin facial wash. 

I wash, warm rinse, cold rinse seal, toner (I like witch hazel), spot treatment if needed, moisturize. Day serum or cream @ night moisturize w facial oil

Basically, I could’ve used this recipe 3 days ago.

4617 2018-08-15 15:08:57 Exotic dips, oil and vinegar preparation. 
4618 2018-08-15 15:08:56 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
4619 2018-08-15 15:08:47 Its not the ingredients. One of the benefits is also coconut oil releases heat from your body. When you use it as skin care you can lose body heat and get sick

4636 2018-08-15 15:06:47 The pipeline will traverse mostly via community land, hence the need for a proper compensation and/or relocation framework.

4638 2018-08-15 15:06:40 $CPG is doing better then most, way better.  If oil did collapse, you can presume that Crescent Point would be most protected via their current money-losing hedges, which created a "theoretical" loss on paper in Q2; if so, it would be a paper gain if WTI drops below hedged value
4639 2018-08-15 15:06:34 Senator John Barrasso, please rethink your recently introduced legislation that would weaken the Clean Water Act, making it easier for polluting companies to build dirty oil and gas pipelines, massive dams, and other harmful projects that pose threats to the environment.
4640 2018-08-15 15:06:28 YES! I love my Air Fryer! So easy to fry nice and crispy without all the oil and mess. Worth the investment. I have a Phillips. Love it!
4641 2018-08-15 15:06:26 So, a few days ago my check oil light came on. Well this morning, my dad walks out and goes, “seems about time you get your oil changed”. 

Okay, let’s look past that shitty fragmented sentence, but how tf did he know....I’m now convinced my dad is a 1,000 year old Jedi
4642 2018-08-15 15:06:26 Total agreement, it’s really important. As NYISO’s power continues to get cleaner, big opportunity to swap out NG/oil boilers. And that just leaves transportation, but the subway seems seems to be going fine these days
4643 2018-08-15 15:06:20 -For sensitive skin

4645 2018-08-15 15:06:07 Why IMO 2020? Light sweet does not necessarily produce low sulphur fuel oil. That is a wrong assumption. Also it produces a lot less distillates whatcha will be necessary to cover IMO needs.

4647 2018-08-15 15:06:03 Here's some great reasons to buy electric vehicles:  say goodbye to smelly gas, oil changes and a noisy ride. Say hello to tax rebates, awesome quiet ride and a lower carbon footprint for your transportation needs. A Tesla always lets you know where you can find a quick charge.

4651 2018-08-15 15:05:37 Why not! That way Natural Resources can be locked up so your backers can obtain sole franchise at a later date. You know, when oil and geothermal are far more valuable. @ABQJournal @CrucesSunNews @roswelldaily @CCurrentArgus @demingheadlight @KOB4 @krqe_headlines @koat7news
4652 2018-08-15 15:05:37 I got scars from my accident a few years ago and the moment I took the cast off, the orthopedic surgeon told me to use vitamin C oil or bio oil on my fresh scars. I’ve got no scars to prove I was even in an accident

Not only did I heal myself, but I smell like a fuckin roasted potato 
4661 2018-08-15 15:05:04 Nah most probably a bad fever thats all but it depends on your body immunity system actually. If you have a medical record of getting sick often its not advised to use coconut oil often
4662 2018-08-15 15:05:04 Max Oil,,!!

4673 2018-08-15 15:04:00 I point to the McCrone report as actual evidence showing it would work well and even Shell this week said there is 50 years of oil in the North Sea. Production 13, sell rate 73. The gap is called a profit, a whack to the companies and a tax return to the country they supply from.
4674 2018-08-15 15:03:57 Imagine calling someone a wrestling nonce when you spend 80% of your day walking round in your underpants smothered in baby oil jumping off step ladders in your garden. Sad.
4675 2018-08-15 15:03:50 Just talking our #Reuters oil analyst team...go figure the EIA estimates the estimates...that (m b/d crude import number doesn't exactly equal the #imports by country #soclose
4676 2018-08-15 15:03:45 So glad I took the time, not! Your response is unsatisfactory. We were not informed that the Quorn burger was not vegetarian because you cooked it in meat oil! They only told us the onion rings were not vegan due to the broken fryer.

4679 2018-08-15 15:03:37 Oh, no. New black spot on driveway under the car. We think it's power steering fluid, hopefully not oil.
4680 2018-08-15 15:03:35 I get it...I would feel the same if someone was here trying to kill us, but don't the Saudi's control the oil in the Middle East? I don't want war... God created man, and I love everyone. It is a shame that greedy men wage war for personal gains.
4681 2018-08-15 15:03:28 Jimmy lost in 1980 because voters chose
- fairy tales over hard truths,
- Liberals like Ted Kennedy betrayed him,
- he was sabotaged by corrupt DC, big oil & the military industrial complex.

"Wow Big Oil and the scum bag nazi short sellers are colluding with the SEC" $TSLA
4690 2018-08-15 15:02:47 Just imagine it. You back a petrostate monarchy to secure oil but then they start an embargo because your leader snubbed them so you fund a socialist revolution but they nationalise the oilfields so you get a neighbouring warlord to invade but they...
4691 2018-08-15 15:02:45 Yes! Yes! Yes! And we are being poisoned by our water, food and air while Trump and big oil and Monsanto get richer! Does anyone believe Trump is making big oil rich and getting nothing from it??
4692 2018-08-15 15:02:38 I make tuna a lot with olive oil and white beans and lemon plus seasonings. Great to eat alone, with pita chips, and I suspect tuna with oil and lemon is fine on a sammich too
4693 2018-08-15 15:02:37 We couldn't afford to heat w/ electric, nor could we afford to heat with oil or kerosene. Now we heat with natural gas & our heating bill is 2/3 less. We heat our water w/ gas at a fraction of the cost of our previous electric water heater. Beggers can't be choosers in WV.

4700 2018-08-15 15:01:40 You have to eat less of the carbs, i.e Rice. Avoid the oil, and minimise the masala. Increase the meat/fish to stay full and get your protein.

4703 2018-08-15 15:01:30 Looks like you got bte and some other oil stocks wrong as went lot lower than you thought they would go. Guess that  means oil sector is finished?
4704 2018-08-15 15:01:28 Agreed. Best advice I've come across is (unfortunately) from Jamie Oliver, who says putting some olive oil and paprika in even the worst shop hummus can liven it up. Doesn't always do the trick, but the equivalent of making a cheap bottle of plonk drinkable.
4705 2018-08-15 15:01:23 My new book: OIL and GOD
Oil protected SaudiA before & after 9/11.
G W Bush ignored Wahhabi culpability, destroyed Iraq, only for Iran to control Baghdad.
Obama aided Qom more:
-Pulled US troops from Iraq too early
-Embraced PM Maliki-Qom's man
-Midwifed JCPOA
-Gave Syria to Iran

4710 2018-08-15 15:00:49 Senator John Barrasso recently introduced legislation that would weaken the Clean Water Act, making it easier for polluting companies to build dirty oil and gas pipelines, massive dams, and other harmful projects that pose threats to the environment.
4711 2018-08-15 15:00:42 So very true! Trump is not qualified to do anything! His big focus is on making $$$ with big oil @ the Monsanto merger so our food, water and air will be poisoned. And it’s happening now! He’s destroying our planet, @ he has to be stopped!

4723 2018-08-15 15:00:13 The Trump presidency is like me selling my beloved car to my in laws. " We didn't do anything to it". Yeah the car filled itself with an extra 4 quarts of oil and no one did it. Sell it cheap and destroy it ASAP.
4724 2018-08-15 15:00:05 Could care less the country is so divided, RACE problems,Illegal Immigrants, Healthcare, Marriage, Abortion, Economy, Oil drilling,Equal pay, and it's been like this for decades
4725 2018-08-15 15:00:05 Can you recommend a clinic that is trustworthy? I am interested in CBD oil but I don't want to be consulted by Cheech and Chong. I think this can help me greatly with depression and anxiety.
4726 2018-08-15 15:00:04 This divisive mantra at BBC is quite amazing. Today we’ve had radiology specialists, #babyboxes P1&2 testing in schools,  Shell oil N Sea success ...and now ferry queues. And each and every article stirs up a pro/anti @scotgov stance. Why not stick to reporting the news.
4727 2018-08-15 14:59:57 They do sell Duke’s here. And yeah as I remember it’s great. I generally use the Sir Kensington brand usually. Their avocado oil batch is spot on. But, I am not so discerning about mayo. I even like Fabanaise. It’s pretty good. #MayonnaiseSnob is my new band name
4728 2018-08-15 14:59:43 Venezuela isn’t even Socialist.. They are Saudi Arabia without the royal family.. State owed oil companies run the economy, thus the collapse. The only socialist thing they are known for is Free Plastic Surgery for their Beauty Pageant contestants 
4729 2018-08-15 14:59:21  use green tea bags and ice cold spoons for puffy under-eyes
 use an exfoliant w AHA and lactic acid
 oily and moisturized are not the same
 use a sunscreen that is oil free to avoid breakouts
4730 2018-08-15 14:59:11 Gag reflex?? My aunt said the same thing! What oil did you use? I use coconut. But I’m also a lover of all things coconut lol

4747 2018-08-15 14:57:48 If you wanna go a bit extra with hair care, there are ways of using honey or olive oil to help strengthen and moisturize your hair. Getting split ends trimmed when they crop up helps with the appearance of breakage and flyaways too.

4749 2018-08-15 14:57:44 No, we disagree about whether "we'll pay for it with oil" constitutes planning. I point to the example of 2014 onward as proof that it does not.

4758 2018-08-15 14:56:53 - use aloe Vera or Shea butter for moisturising 
- after shaving use cold water to reduce the redness
- exfoliate before shaving to prevent ingrown hair
- cover the affected areas with Aloe Vera gel, tea tree oil or coconut oil
4759 2018-08-15 14:56:27 1. Plenty of water
2. Tea 
3. Apply hot water to the spot
4. Apply ice to the spot (it’s all about the vessels so see what works for you by diluting or contracting them)
5. Aromatherapy - what I did when breastfeeding and unable to take meds for migraines- lavender oil helped me
4760 2018-08-15 14:56:25 And conservatism has become hippy bashing, overt racist policies, demanding free things for oil and defense companies.

4769 2018-08-15 14:55:24 Inhaling oil vapour is probably as bad if not worse than smoking tobacco. Vapers don't inhale oil, just glycerine and propylene glycol, which are both approved for use in medical devices.

4776 2018-08-15 14:54:59 1 ) The allegation that the CEO of Rosneft ( Russia's National oil company ) offered Trump through Page a 19% private stake in Rosneft is OBVIOUS BS. That would be 19% of 12 BILLION dollars worth of shares, or 2.28 billion dollars.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
4808 2018-08-15 14:51:18 itu salah, kalo mau goreng telur pake olive oil atau oil yg lemaknya baik, garamnya ganti pake garam himalayan atau nutrisalin.

4813 2018-08-15 14:51:07 Yeah I want to try the drops! I've placed a couple calls to see a doctor to get my medical marijuana card because right now I'm at a limited level of functioning. From what I know you need a card to purchase CBD oil.

4820 2018-08-15 14:50:09 Wasn't @MalcolmNance a long time member of the "Crazy 23"? Didn't he vote for all those Republicans? Wasn't #W enough? Why did it take the utter Fascism of the idiot #Drumpf to drive him away from their madness? Here's what I'd consider: #Oil, #DickCheney, #Putin and an #Iraq war
4821 2018-08-15 14:50:07 I'd say EU wide.
Suppose I'm a bit sensitive to it, some journalists have decided  farmers are now responsible for everything from climate change (apparently we hold more power than oil companies these days which is a surprise to us...) to either poisoning everyone or obesity

4828 2018-08-15 14:49:46 In other words, we hit a refining wall for shale oil in the US... any additional refinery runs has to come from the heavier imports. 

Any additional shale production has to be exports because of the refining wall.

4829 2018-08-15 14:49:38 Michael, migrants are well cared for in the UK.

There's not enough money for migrants - maybe oil rich Saudi should take them in. 
btw have u taken in any migrants to live in your home? 
If not, please do so, thanks.

4834 2018-08-15 14:49:12 Actually it would be a vote for Great Bear Petroleum. The big oil company from TX, where her husband Patrick Galvin is a top executive. The largest exploration leaseholder in the North Slope and wanting to drill #ANWR. Which she is totally supporting. That is who she really is.
4835 2018-08-15 14:48:53 Thank you so much!  This sounds really lovely, and I like the idea of an oil (haven't yet tried one).

4838 2018-08-15 14:48:39 they better not be cause i need to fill up the tank and get an oil changed it needs to be cheap
4839 2018-08-15 14:48:39 The left loves to talk about the carbon footprint of the oilsands, but never seems to have much to say about the environmental cost of shipping tankers of oil halfway across the planet.
4840 2018-08-15 14:48:35 Agree 100%! Trump is hell bent on poisoning our water and food and killing every animal on our planet so big oil can become bigger and big corps who want to contaminate our food can become richer. He’s a complete waste.

4843 2018-08-15 14:48:21 So, you plan to pay for independence with oil, with lashings of hyperbole. Genius. Amazing that hasn't been tried before.
4844 2018-08-15 14:48:20 Hemp and cannabis were criminalized with the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 to pave the way for the oil monopolies on energy, pharmaceuticals and wood pulp, processed with petrochemicals for paper. We have an oil based toxic world thanks to the oiligarchs.

4856 2018-08-15 14:46:57 I guess the bigger point is it’s our number one export for the country. The government kills Western Canadian oil with regulations and imports oil with zero restrictions. Shameful.
4857 2018-08-15 14:46:57 ?? I accept all accusations because I did it ! I did jokes about oil on fire and french fries ! I'm the bad girl here, I'm sorry XD
4858 2018-08-15 14:46:51 i second this !!! however if you wanted something with a gentle scrub then angels on bare skin is also a safe bet. it has lavender which helps to balance oil production and ground almonds to exfoliate and brighten and rose which is gentle on sensitive skin :)

4868 2018-08-15 14:46:10 It all comes down to education. School choice in dense urban areas are a good start, to keep poor black kids from being trapped in terrible schools. The neighborhoods will follow in a generation or two. We always think short term. We need to think generationally.
4869 2018-08-15 14:46:05 Avoid hair products that have isopropyl alcohol in them as it’ll dry your hair out. Coconut oil is really good for softness and keeping in moisture. When your hair gets long enough, use hair scrunchies as they’re way less damaging to your hair and don’t pull on it as much

And she's not a Democrat.
4899 2018-08-15 14:43:37 Fracking pollutes our air and drinking water, hurts communities, worsens climate change, and is linked to earthquakes. It is unacceptable that the oil and gas industry profits offfracking at our expense. It's time to say no to fracking, and yes to clean, renewable energy.

4945 2018-08-15 14:41:09 That Gordon Brown doomsday scenario assumes that foreign investment would not pour in John. I am sure it would. As for 60 years of austerity with oil worth 20b plus a year ongoing when contracts reworked and tax haven deals cancelled then your figures are shall we say lacking.

5008 2018-08-15 14:36:10 I don't see post-2014 oil prices as low. I see 2009-2014 prices as deliberately inflated for resilience/energy security reasons. That is why in 2012 with oil at $110/bbl I forecast it would go to $45/$50 bbl when QE ended
5009 2018-08-15 14:36:04 ice if you can plus pain reliever of choice. I also get headaches focused in my temples from it and I think rubbing just a drop or two of peppermint essential oil on them helps, even if it's a placebo at least it smells nice

5020 2018-08-15 14:35:31 The problem is that NATO has priotised access to cheap oil, at the expense of propping up puppet dictators and religious extremists, rather than encourage secularisation and democracy in the region.
5021 2018-08-15 14:35:31 It is called global economy. we don't own all the gas and oil exports around the world. Besides we should not be exporting oil and gas as long as prices here are high here in the US. Your just helping the oil and gas companies who pay you a__hole.

5131 2018-08-15 14:27:34 Then there is the way our oil industry is structured.

It is very easy to to massage profit levels with good accounting

5149 2018-08-15 14:26:31 A lot of this money gets spent within Scotland to the benefit of our economy. It's called the multiplier effect, you might have heard of it. Then there is the long term effects of our oil reserves which bring economic security into the future. Investors like this.

5217 2018-08-15 14:19:58 Yes, And I may or may not have purchased and consumed them. If I did then it is possible that some products had a positive outcome. Why do you ask? Hemp derived CBD OIL and the legislation surrounding it is an interest. Do you have information to share?

5231 2018-08-15 14:18:14 Hi there,

Once recreational cannabis is legalized, this store will offer our core medical products including Spectrum Cannabis softgel, oil, and dried formats, along with some Tweed and Craftgrow Collection strains. 

Feel free to send us a DM with any questions you may have.
5232 2018-08-15 14:18:11 And enjoy the #trumpflation along the way. 

Costs up on everything. Starting to turn into higher prices for consumers. 

Nobody knew trade wars, goosing an already hot economy and destabilizing the Middle East oil market could be so complicated.

5240 2018-08-15 14:17:11 In 2016 32% of germany' electricity came from renewables, pretty impressive. They are on track to reduce greenhouse gases by 80-95% & hit a target of a 60% share for renewables by 2050. We're still frantically drilling for oil.

5242 2018-08-15 14:16:54 this is nice but how about Trudeau also stops his plans to murder Indigenous people on behalf of oil companies? Maybe even provide them with safe drinking water to enjoy on their new day off?
5243 2018-08-15 14:16:54 Toefoo isn’t too bad if you fry it in enough oil and make a dip for it from mayonnaise and Frank’s Hot Sauce. But hummus, that’s just mashed up beans.  Mix it with enough sour cream, dill, chives, and I can tolerate it on a potato chips if I need an emergency dip.

5257 2018-08-15 14:15:34 No, they haven't, and that's what is so frustrating. They don't want to hear about what isn't working. Just like being in a car that needs oil and repairs, but they keep driving. Running is certainly a learning experience. Something that isn't taught in colleges of education...

5282 2018-08-15 14:13:24 It's not really that I'm freaked out - I've been eating pretty well lately and just looking for other ways to incrementally improve health.

 the less heat the better I curl my hair maybe 3 times in a whole year so don’t use heat.

5291 2018-08-15 14:12:13 Major lesson in going natural: a greased scalp is not healthy. In fact, keeping it on the dryer side is probably healthier than smothering it in oil and grease.

i was against being part of euro in 2014 as I thought Scot pound would rise on oil revenues anyway compared to rUK, but I am now ambivalent.

5407 2018-08-15 14:00:31 Like 10$ per change maybe but you also have to take care of the oil afterwards and have the equipment to do it so usually the average person it is not financially worthwhile to learn unless you do it for like 5 years or more I’d say because of the cost of the floor jack and stand

5497 2018-08-15 13:52:01 Aviation will still continue to be reliant on oil for the time being (although there's been recent progress in developing aviation biofuels).
5498 2018-08-15 13:51:50 $EPE is under technical pressure as Seabed Veil is liquidating it’s 12.5mm share investment. It has currently sold 8mm shares. Needs another 17 days to clear out of the whole position. It’s a cheap oil option at this price , however this overhang can cause short term pain.
5499 2018-08-15 13:51:47 lmao why yall buy cheap stuff? invest in your skin and get the heliocare 360 oil free sunscreen
5500 2018-08-15 13:51:47 We need to keep oil and gas in the ground. #Offfossilfuel
5501 2018-08-15 13:51:42 Have you read the mccrone report? If u think Tories aren't in bed with big oil you're utterly deluded.
5502 2018-08-15 13:51:24 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
5503 2018-08-15 13:51:13 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of small dollar donations - fueled by Trump supporters....." @nypost Thank you!
5504 2018-08-15 13:51:12 Mormons get a bad rap. They should. Their religion is a fairytale invented by one snake oil salesman.
5505 2018-08-15 13:50:57 thought it was coconut oil?
5506 2018-08-15 13:50:54 Desde que tengo el unicorn oil no se lo que es salir sin highlitght holo hermo
5507 2018-08-15 13:50:34 Well all others are red so....
5508 2018-08-15 13:50:28 maxipeel exfoliant cream really saved my skin from hyperpigmentation  i'm putting bio-oil on top of it too and i'll update everyone after two weeks of using the oil if it's effective
5509 2018-08-15 13:50:09 Here's a trick I’ve picked up along our kitchen journey:
• When frying meat, use tongs and always add the meat to the pan by laying it away from you. This prevents the oil from splashing and burning you.
5510 2018-08-15 13:49:58 I would buy maize flour 1 bundle( 12,2kg packets) at Shs.1200.00, Cooking oil 4litres at 450.00,sugar 2kg packet at 310.00, wheat flour 2kg two packets at shs. 250.00, Rice 4kgs at 440 and 1 packet of pampers no. 5 at shs. 225.00 and shs. 125.00 to go for one panga bar soap
5511 2018-08-15 13:49:46 Yes, he is. And a criminal con-man. A snake oil salesman selling a damaged package of foul goods.
5512 2018-08-15 13:49:32 TRUMP SUCKS...HERES WHY...

In case you haven't connected the dots... Putin controls the largest oil company in Russia. He made a 500 Billion dollar deal with the CEO of Exxon Mobil. Obama put sanctions in place which stopped that deal.
5513 2018-08-15 13:49:30 Yes! @crackingleaders been doing it for c 2 years, v openly, has gathered many together to help with assessments etc. Make contact here or at fbk..banned Aid: weed the world, for info re cannabis oil, from experts/ dyingtoknow about cancer and wellness for the wellness info.

5516 2018-08-15 13:49:24 We are Canada and every part of Canada counts. Although I would much rather have a green economy there are parts of Canada that still rely on oil for a major portion of their economic plan. The Liberals are doing the right thing by standing up for all of Canada.
5517 2018-08-15 13:49:13 .
5518 2018-08-15 13:49:12 Mayonnaise without egg is not mayonnaise. That's just an oil emulsion, or given the garlic, aioli.
5519 2018-08-15 13:49:11 Oil.
5520 2018-08-15 13:49:09 Beginning of the summer I would wake up everyday with so much stomach pain  now it don’t hurt nearly as bad as I was. Thank you black seed oil
5521 2018-08-15 13:48:59 最近とっても充実してて楽しい。
5522 2018-08-15 13:48:57 Iran and Russia only sell oil and NatGas. So importa wont be affected homie
5523 2018-08-15 13:48:50 Electricity...instead of depending of crude oil that is just destroying the eco system, water, wind and solar sources of energy would be cultivated in. Once electricity is solved, productivity can increase at cheaper cost
5524 2018-08-15 13:48:38 This has nothing to do with Zionism (i.e., the right of Israel to survive). Your hate blinds you. This is about control over Mideast oil.
5525 2018-08-15 13:48:38 Olive oil makes salads taste bitter. It’s vile even the ‘good stuff’
5526 2018-08-15 13:48:33 Flint Michigan still does not have clean water, the president wants to waste our tax money on a wall to separate us from Mexico like East Germany did back in 1961. Ppl are claiming the news outlets report fake news. They are drilling for oil on native land #LetThatSinkIn
5527 2018-08-15 13:48:31 Water proof = use oil to remove. It’s a good tip to remember ;) also avoid waterproof make up anytime you have a bad acne flair up cause usually it means oily skin everywhere and that will reject your best face and make it look more like a zombie in July face ;)
5528 2018-08-15 13:48:07 I have a difficult autoimmune disease, and the only relief I get is from CBD oil.  I haven't asked my doctor yet about medical cannabis, but have heard from others that it helps the condition.  Thank you for your open-mindedness.
5529 2018-08-15 13:48:07 Most sectors traded lower, with the oil and coal products sector leading losses as oil prices slipped, while financials and technology also recorded declines. Among heavyweights, SoftBank Group dropped 1.29 percent and Fast Retailing slipped 0.27 percent.
5530 2018-08-15 13:48:02 At gf house. I get bread, eggs and some lard for her son to fry up a buttie:
“Is that coconut oil?”
....yeah, we’ve ruined this generation...
5531 2018-08-15 13:48:00 Israel influences America, we follow and do what America wants us to do and it is money and oil that makes it all go round ....
5532 2018-08-15 13:47:54 I'd paint "See a man about a dog, here!"
5533 2018-08-15 13:47:53 I’m more of a Steel Mill, Oil Refinery, Casino kind of guy. I had all of those with me in the morning.
5534 2018-08-15 13:47:49 OMGGGGGG.

This backs up all my theories about younger, middle-to upper- class Whites.  I have always said that, they don't know where they belong & that makes them confused.  B/c they have been taught that owning their heritage is "bad."
5535 2018-08-15 13:47:48 ちょっとしたことで娘に冷たい態度をとってしまって、しばらくしてから言い方が悪かったことを謝ったんだけど、どうしてこんなにあっさりと許してくれるのだろう。本当は許したくないけど、「ごめんね」って言われたら「いいよ」しなきゃいけないと思ってるのかな…

5537 2018-08-15 13:47:38 Some ppl esp ppl like Pallavi Ghose need hot oil in their Ears, it will clean and clear their Ears and their Bheja too.
5538 2018-08-15 13:47:33 Spitting out the white, I think? Also, oil, not shortening.  When you make it at home, you are using an egg yolk to emulsify a vinaigrette. I hope this fills you with pleasurable disgust?
5539 2018-08-15 13:47:14 Of course, which is what I said but if the expectation is to contend for a Championship, that isn't realistic.
5540 2018-08-15 13:47:12 Hi afifah! U pakai oil cleanser takk?
5541 2018-08-15 13:47:02 ...health, we must also worry about the economic health of communities and their people. You can't just close down the oil industry today without your whole economy collapsing. So, common sense needs to prevail. Young people can protest peacefully and legally and keep...

5551 2018-08-15 13:46:08 The farm bailout will be a severance package to small family farmers if Agent Orange doesn’t stop the stupid trade war. Once they’re out of business the big corporate farms will be an oligopoly and start fixing prices. Property values will tank for oil and gas co. to buy up farms
5552 2018-08-15 13:45:44 My lavender oil used to do wonders, & at times like this I’m really missing it 
5553 2018-08-15 13:45:38 思ったことを脳を介さず脊髄で言っちゃうタイプだから
5554 2018-08-15 13:45:38 Black oil in we veins
5555 2018-08-15 13:45:37 Yeah, your "G" peddles snake oil to help old white men make their pee pee hard again while convincing them that nobody died in Sandy Hook and filling them with enough vitrol to attack their parents as "crisis actors"

Yeah what a total gangster
5556 2018-08-15 13:45:35 My dads answer for anytime someone asks how to do something is “just use common sense.”

Because common sense is how you cook meat or put oil in your car when you’ve never done it before...
5557 2018-08-15 13:45:29 If hh does anything, I'd expect a couple of guys on the cheap but not an impact piece at either position.
5558 2018-08-15 13:45:29 Yes, Incite ! Marx was an Authoritarian, T****  is an Authoritarian in training, Alex Jones is a Fool Grifter selling snake oil and “inciting” fear and hatred. I contribute every hate crime of the “poorly educated” to both him and T****.

5562 2018-08-15 13:45:07 Too bad then that the national Democratic Party is still playing lobbyist politics over people politics I guess, especially with the DNC chair opening the floodways for fossil fuel money again so Gas & Oil can buy your votes again. :/

5564 2018-08-15 13:44:42 You mean Iran that is just as agressive, radical and dangerous as Saudi Arabia? Even if we decide to trade with Iran, we would also cut our BIGGEST oil importer - America. You proved you dont know shit about economy and trade. Typical leftism.

5581 2018-08-15 13:42:55 Putting our nation’s energy dependence into the hands of foreign countries is a huge national security risk. 

This is why oil, natural gas and coal are important to the future of the United States!

5590 2018-08-15 13:41:39 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
5591 2018-08-15 13:41:35 hmm well we had to draw smaller postcard sized paintings with acrylics in school and after that draw with oil colours on a bigger format and they all look really good and I got an A on almost all of them so I think these could actually relax me but they are really expensive:(
5592 2018-08-15 13:41:19 Yes that's why it's important not to burn fossil fuels, because they release the CO2 back into the atmosphere. Wood coal and oil are the planets way of capturing CO2. it's just over the last 200 years humans have been burning it and releasing it back into the atmosphere.
5593 2018-08-15 13:41:17 Just change of oil...

5598 2018-08-15 13:40:23 I'm not a beekeeper Bill but people mentioning peppermint oil.  This can be had from aromatherapy oil suppliers. You need the pure essential oil not the watered down stuff.

5603 2018-08-15 13:40:03 If you remember, renewable and nonrenewable energy can be used as primary energy sources (coal, oil, gas) and converted into secondary energy sources such as electricity. Electricity has always been here all around us, just in a different form!
5604 2018-08-15 13:39:49 Our MP Liberal Darrell Samson tells me the Energy East Pipeline was cancelled due to the low cost of oil. He was completely useless on this issue. We need a national program to refine our oil in Canada. Refining our oil to our standards. Could you give him a call or email?

5608 2018-08-15 13:39:24 @SebitWilliamKer Hi, my colleague at Wood Mackenzie Anthea Pitt passed on your name. I am looking to write a piece on the latest Sudanese/South Sudanese peace talks and potential effect on oil and gas output. I wonder if you might have time to have a quick chat? Thanks Ash

5610 2018-08-15 13:39:16 After Kurdish Referendum Exports of Kirkuk oil to Turkey were stopped. Then Baghdad started to Export to Iran, but also this didnt work, because of ISIS attacks. Now, Baghdad wants direct trade with Turkey and KRG says, no, only with a deal that includes Erbil.
5611 2018-08-15 13:39:01 Lol highlighter is really overdone these days jeez. Feel they glowing looking like they were doused in oil.

Lagos,
Please where can I get good scented massage oil for Aromatherapy.
A shop or somewhere. I need it urgently.
5620 2018-08-15 13:38:26 We are lucky to have people like you.  I appreciate your fight for MS and medical marijuana. I go against a lot of my conservative brethren in this because I have seen people with MS benefit greatly from cannabis. I would like cannabis oil to also be readily available for folks.
5621 2018-08-15 13:38:21 Is it really surprising? That's what the Unionists have always done. Convince 5 million people that they have a responsibility to support 63 million people. Keeping oil would be greedy (Forsyth)  etc. etc
5622 2018-08-15 13:38:13 If an equilibrium emerges with a single dominant SoV (like gold was for much of history), the monetary premium of assets like oil, real estate, art and maybe even stocks will fall.
5623 2018-08-15 13:38:00 BURN HIM ! OIL BURNS EASILY !!
5624 2018-08-15 13:37:59 맞아 그런것ㅇ같애~~

5627 2018-08-15 13:37:23 I am actually unable to comment on their domestic economic policies other than their use of oil revenues to support govt services. 

I can however point to those external forces, cooperating with disenfranchised upper class, to control the economy.
5628 2018-08-15 13:37:21 Donny's kiss of death!!! Another doomed to fail endorsement from the traitorous snake oil salesman.
5629 2018-08-15 13:37:19 Use coconut oil or take a load of cum on your face, I think it will do the trick. You're a pretty girl either way. Good luck.
5630 2018-08-15 13:37:18 You'll be sitting in your corner drinking your 8 glasses of water per day while soaked in coconut oil, minding your business afike usathane akulinge kuba kaloku there's no chill.
5631 2018-08-15 13:37:16 Liqui moly k engine oil ache b hote hain ya sirf aise he baatn hain
5632 2018-08-15 13:37:10 The CBD OIL IS IN, kill your pain believe me this is great.
5633 2018-08-15 13:37:07 Oil change
5634 2018-08-15 13:36:58 So how much carbon are the BC fires generating?
I bet it's more than the oil industry does in a year.
5635 2018-08-15 13:36:56 I quite enjoy these emails. Make me feel for a brief few seconds that I'm a world class expert in: oil detection, robotics, drugs development and buffalos (no kidding). In your face Newton...
5636 2018-08-15 13:36:48 Did you know @DerrickMTV worked in the oil field. And that he had an epic battle with @joss_mooney if not he will remind you every podcast.
5637 2018-08-15 13:36:42 Beautiful writing doc . I am following your food advice for the past month. First stopped meat. Today I switched off dairy. Next is oil. Hope to continue like this.
5638 2018-08-15 13:36:42 그래서 그 뒤에 다이쇼 시대때가 아니네라고 적었엉
5639 2018-08-15 13:36:37 feeling aechmeas arm and he literally just has a thick layer of oil covering himself
5640 2018-08-15 13:36:13 .
5641 2018-08-15 13:36:06 1) Massive inefficiency in use of funds
2) Kickbacks in defense procurement
3) Kickbacks while Army officers manage other state institutions (WAPDA, Pakistan Railways, etc.)
4) Smuggling of cash, narcotics, cars & oil
5642 2018-08-15 13:35:50 Purpose of ins comp. 1. Pool risk 2. Spread cost (over time - like oil change for routine exam). People can spread cost on their own. This is a self regulated single payer system ... shocker, it works!! Would be interesting to see dem. of people in need / dem. of donators
5643 2018-08-15 13:35:47 AMAZON IS AMAZIN. Your iPhone charger broke? Amazon. Need tanning oil? Amazon. Want an avocado duvet set? Amazon. Looking for a pair of duck feet? Amazon is the place guys
5644 2018-08-15 13:35:37 Never trust a nigga that dont like dressing on his salad either. Just out here eating dry ass lettuce. No olive oil or nothing jesus. 
5645 2018-08-15 13:35:36 たそぱい揉むぞ
5646 2018-08-15 13:35:25 Really I'm against  of both paedophilia and prosperity gospel. You know here in Africa it is not rare to find a place of worship turned into a business place of commercialisation selling prayers, blessings,  oil, candles etc. And Jesus becomes less of a centre but money.
5647 2018-08-15 13:35:15 They are both to blame. Will Muslims be happy if we started selling everything with pig skin and oil? They need to do the right thing and respect the sentiments of hindus and laws of the country, otherwise don't cry when we call you Pakistanis.
5648 2018-08-15 13:35:13 What a complete scam to portray this as a 10% drop in emissions. I'd much rather have petroleum than palm oil diesel.
5649 2018-08-15 13:34:38 そういうとこたまらん可愛いよ
5650 2018-08-15 13:34:35 I tried Brain Octane. I didn't get more benefit from it than with NowFoods MCT Oil which is much cheaper. Being in ketosis for more than three years, I tried so much oils...
5651 2018-08-15 13:34:33 Consider nationalising all oil operations in  — especially the Alberta ones that traitorous PM Harper allowed  to buy (to which, Gov't of  ships over their own labour [all of whom get fast-tracked  citizenship, though they have complete allegiance to ) 
5652 2018-08-15 13:34:29 China imported  about $228 billion worth of integrated circuits in 2016 – more than  it spent on imported oil. The country is investing heavily to try to  wean itself off its reliance on the US for semiconductors and other key  tech components amid escalating tech-trade tensions.
5653 2018-08-15 13:34:25 Why is mayo getting such a bad rap? I personally don't eat the stuff made from soy, but good real mayo has no substitute. And Miracle Whip as a substitute for mayo is like brake fluid as a substitute for olive oil.

5655 2018-08-15 13:34:15 Psalm 141:5 NIV
Let a righteous man strike me---that is a kindness; let him rebuke me---that is oil on my head....
5656 2018-08-15 13:33:51 Thanks for choosing Express Oil Change & Tire Engineers, Marcie!! 
5657 2018-08-15 13:33:50 oil price down, slack retail..inflation going south in the next 6 months
5658 2018-08-15 13:33:46 I'm a ketone skeptic, but I've been taking powdered MCT oil in my morning coffee for the past week and I've broken 250lbs for the first time in a year. I'm finally making progress again!

5661 2018-08-15 13:33:36 Our oil is too expensive for that

5663 2018-08-15 13:33:21 一周まわって、記憶が恐い。なんでこんな不安定なものを拠り所にできちゃうんだろ
5664 2018-08-15 13:33:21 Sonic and Knuckles are much like oil and water.
5665 2018-08-15 13:33:21 Coal is NEVER coming back, but you persist in lying about bringing the coal industry back!  You bringing back the buggy whip & whale oil lamp industries too?!  You are corrupt!
5666 2018-08-15 13:33:12 Body shops tea tree face wash and tea tree oil, swear by it
5667 2018-08-15 13:33:03 omg but what if he isnt meat? he could be pure oil
5668 2018-08-15 13:33:02 Earlier Turkey was nicknamed Sick man of Europe. Ottoman Empire.
Now Oil has changed all d parameters.
But now Europe is at d mercy of ME/Arabs.
They can outbuy any person anywhere in d world.
Judiciary/Politicians r in d line of fire.
Be watchful!
5669 2018-08-15 13:32:51 wala pala akong oil pastel hahahah
5670 2018-08-15 13:32:46 Our network is to discuss oil and gas, fossil fuels!
5671 2018-08-15 13:32:34 bongga maka 'glass skin' ang baby oil ba HAHAHAHAH
5672 2018-08-15 13:32:30 Yep, let’s send more kids to a never ending oil war instead of being able to afford higher education.  Seems to be working. Ask the thousands of PTSD veterans from this “war” we are still bogged down in.
5673 2018-08-15 13:32:17 クンぽせの中で末っ子なの、改めて考えると尊さで泣けてくるな
5674 2018-08-15 13:32:05 Domestic consumption & exports measure different things. Total product demand is bottom line but export capacity is limited by oil quality & price among other things. Becoming clearer that China's recent purchases of U.S. crude have been politically motivated to appease Trump.
5675 2018-08-15 13:32:03 You've been such a Good Girl being my midnight snack and fucktoy...waking me up with a blowjob was worth extra points too babydolk
You've earned a good lengthy spanking tonight. Maybe I'll oil the thrillo and spank your backside while the toy does the front.
5676 2018-08-15 13:31:59 Hi Kyle. The oil we cook our fries in do not share with anything else and they do not contain dairy. Please be aware however that there is always a risk of cross contamination, so be cautious.
5677 2018-08-15 13:31:52 This may well stand as the most ridiculous tweet you're ever tweeted. And that's saying something.

"The FBI and the CIA, and J Edgar Hoover and the oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's room attendant at the White House?"
"I would leave out the men's room attendant."
5678 2018-08-15 13:31:44 OMG maybe theyare being sold the Forth Bridges and Edinburgh Castle because we were assured there was no more oil to be had in 2014.
5679 2018-08-15 13:31:38 80s rock and lavender oil to calm my soul 
5680 2018-08-15 13:31:34 Have you tried pure cbd oil?  Not talking about any mixed with ingredients. I say that as I was bed ridden for almost 9 years and massive chronic pain and also on 60 pills Daily!  I tried so many cbd oils and nothing. But when I got on the pure this changed. No lies.
5681 2018-08-15 13:31:33 Putting our nation’s energy dependence into the hands of foreign countries is a huge national security risk. 

This is why oil, natural gas and coal are important to the future of the United States!
5682 2018-08-15 13:31:33 Salad
-Salad is super easy to make and good for you! The salad i like to bring to school consists of lettuce, spinach, chicken (you can add tomatoes, croutons, etc.) i also like to have a light dressing like olive oil. I like to put my salad and dressing separate until lunch.

5687 2018-08-15 13:30:47 This is our world. Trump simply mirrors their values, prejudices, inadequacies, failures, hate and impotency right back at them. He is the greatest snake oil carpetbagger in history.  @BillKristol @SRuhle @JoeNBC @dncpress @Lawrence

Given ME Muslims' love of Islam:
1) Religious minorities must never rule over the Muslim majority—Witness Asads' calamitous destruction of Syria.
2) If Arab rulers are to become legitimate, democracy is a must.
5692 2018-08-15 13:30:29 Two important questions: 1). How do yo milk and oat?  2). Where the oil in vegetable?
5693 2018-08-15 13:30:19 Maybe when an oil sheikh buys a championship dominos club?

5695 2018-08-15 13:30:12 and then theres the Clyde , with its gas and oil - prevented from being used in order to keep Trident in Scotland where its not wanted , and bringing former labour heartlands of Inverclyde , Ardrossan , Saltcoats and Stevenson into the new Aberdeen.

Ah Red and Blue Tories eh?
5696 2018-08-15 13:30:01 Ya they use chili oil also ma hehehe

5698 2018-08-15 13:29:53 Poor Tyga, he was probably home applying castor oil on his new edges and here comes Nicki Minaj and Safaree dragging his name into bitchfest lol
5699 2018-08-15 13:29:44 I hit that wall in the year where it’s hard to get outta bed and I have nothing to look forward to. I haven’t given up on the phillies although they are leaking oil badly. There’s only one thing that can fix me. Eagles football
5700 2018-08-15 13:29:44 I gotta spend almost 700 and I need an oil change 
5701 2018-08-15 13:29:43 ซิสค่ะ สติค่ะสติ

これがあるだけでどんなツイートもアホに見えて最高です
5703 2018-08-15 13:29:37 Not spicy at all the chili oil is not that spicy only red 
5704 2018-08-15 13:29:30 I’m so thankful for Bobby. Not only is he taking my car in to get an oil change, but he’s getting me a new tire because mine went flat this morning. I honestly don’t know what I would do without him 
5705 2018-08-15 13:29:28 Scaring those people is an oil well that never runs dry. I’m surprised there isn’t a formal name for the business or industry of scaring white people.
5706 2018-08-15 13:29:26 This is why I wonder if the oil tycoons are doing this on purpose to cull the population. They certainly have the resources to try to ride it out. (And that’s not even a guarantee.  

But this is just a conspiracy hypothesis 
5707 2018-08-15 13:29:14 Wash + Moisturize your face every night.

5710 2018-08-15 13:28:52 Getting my car’s oil changed today. That’s basically car dialysis right? If it’s not clear I don’t know how cars work.
5711 2018-08-15 13:28:51 I was on a lake with some friends chilling on the boat, and I actually got in the water which was a surprise to my friends. Anyone who knows me that my relationship with water is like oil. 
5712 2018-08-15 13:28:48 I agree with you. There is no reason to move these people from their rich in resources homelands ! If UN was legit, they would help people at home. The Elite Supremacists are robbing “refugees’ “ homelands of land, oil, gas, water, gold, silver, uranium, and other metals.
5713 2018-08-15 13:28:46 By value added you mean something like the smoked mackerel idea?  I've seen all kinds of cool products - crab infused olive oil, seaweed pesto - we have such a wealth of things here that we could be making really cool stuff.

5716 2018-08-15 13:27:49 just had a phone call with a man from Walmart about my oil change while my bird was absolutely losing her mind and the guy couldn’t stop laughing, good morning everyone.
5717 2018-08-15 13:27:49 中華鍋を高温になるまで熱してください。植物油を大さじ2杯加えてください。 →  Heat wok until very hot. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.

So pleased.

(Pics tomorrow. I used too much today, and want to show off the REAL DEAL of this stuff)
5724 2018-08-15 13:26:57 oil bukannya lebih lama nyerepnya ya jdnya essence dulu
5725 2018-08-15 13:26:50 I might look like I’m happy. But deep down I need a black Durag, rain, black timberlands, black leather pants, black leather jacket, baby oil, Cadillac Escalade, and a 2 way.

5735 2018-08-15 13:26:09 Both re gas and re oil
5736 2018-08-15 13:26:06 Do you realize that this compromises your #cells - and your #health? It is a silent disabler. Your #muscles become rigid taking years to show this consequence where you stiffen and injure easily. Any vegetable oil and margarine will do this.
5737 2018-08-15 13:25:56 good afternoon the ancient gays in Greece used olive oil as lube
5738 2018-08-15 13:25:55 You temporarily dismantle CITY HALL to free up all the canpower available to create a vigilant TOWN MILITIA. You divide them into two groups, marking them with distinct teams and ranks using the piece of white CHALK and the MOTOR OIL.
5739 2018-08-15 13:25:43 @CNBC @JimCramerPicks You BIG OIL/FOSSIL FUEL shills on Wall St want @elonmusk to stop tweeting and let @TESLA stock tank! The lengths you greedy bastards will go to destroy a great American company.  Evil greedy people, Evil greedy people. EVIL
5740 2018-08-15 13:25:27 Wuuuu, let’s not talk of olive oil. . We’re still saving up for a bottle. 

We wanted to use margarine but we were scared.
5741 2018-08-15 13:25:13 If nafta & trade is such a BUST, why are USA truck drivers, record manufacturing, North American oil, in such high demand!?!? #freetrade
5742 2018-08-15 13:25:04 For the record Canadian oil imports “United-States 62%, Saudi Arabia 9%, Algeria 9%, Nigeria 8%, Norway 4%.
5743 2018-08-15 13:25:03 Scotland would be better off with it's own oil in the #EU and out of #UK.
5744 2018-08-15 13:24:57 うんうん！
泣いた後は目冷やすのよ？(´･ω･｀)
5745 2018-08-15 13:24:42 That's because of oil prices not because of higher minimum wages
5746 2018-08-15 13:24:41 Try replacing part of the oil/butter in a cookie recipe with it. Getting the benefit without the gross! :)
5747 2018-08-15 13:24:33 お迎え？できてないです

5750 2018-08-15 13:24:27 No it wasn’t. They both are actively destroying renewable energy policy in favor of oil & gas interests. And Perry is dumber than the rock outside his ranch in Texas.
5751 2018-08-15 13:24:26 เธอออออ แค่วิตามินซี ละก็ ultra oil fee ก็เจ๋งละนะ เธอยังจะให้ฉันซื้ออีกหรอมมมม รอปลายเดือนกันยาๆ55555 เอสเคทูชั้นก็อยากได้ เห้อมม

5753 2018-08-15 13:24:02 Dude, the scary thing is this is not a troll.  This person truly feels this way as a result of indoctrination.
5754 2018-08-15 13:23:57 Putting citizens in danger is a Trump regime trend big time: coal polluting water, big oil compromising air, allowing asbestos, attacking ACA...you name it, there’s policy to destroy it.

5759 2018-08-15 13:23:23 That's a pig they rubbed down with mud an oil, yall know ya cant trust dem germans 
5760 2018-08-15 13:23:19 I agree, but then seniors should not have to go the food bank either....a little more oil royalties in our pocket would be nice.....like 45% of it would do some good instead of 9%.
5761 2018-08-15 13:23:16 This is going to sound weird but you could try some peppermint or clove oil (I prefer the flavor of peppermint & it can be found in natural health sections of grocery stores) & rub it on the tooth & surrounding gum. Found it to be surprisingly helpful with tooth pain & swelling.
5762 2018-08-15 13:22:15 Belum punya essence. Sementara ngebiasain dan ngerutinin 1st cleanser, 2nd cleanser, exfoliator, toner, serum, moisturizer, sheet mask, dan sleeping mask, dulu. Ntar kalau uda biasa, naik level nambahin essence dan face oil. Ribet? Iya. banget. Namanya juga ikhtiar bu.
5763 2018-08-15 13:22:14 Because some snake oil seller managed to persuade them to fork over money.

5775 2018-08-15 13:20:54 Thank you, no I just use a little bit of filtered water I do sometimes add a little aquafaba instead of water. I never add oil to it as I find it unnecessary.
5776 2018-08-15 13:20:52 So let's see, I currently view Washington politicians, the mainstream media , the Fed, Wall St, the IMF, Hollywood, the defense industry, the neo-cons, big oil & big chemical as enemies of everything that is good & decent. To that list I am adding big tech.

5824 2018-08-15 13:15:01 Sad. Signed. Emailed Linda McCartney vegetarian food producers too as they use palm oil, which surprised me, they said it was a sustainable form, but I let them know I still had serious concerns.

5832 2018-08-15 13:13:48 I know what I asked. You can't answer it, but have repeatedly tried to re-frame it. You are growing an illegal substance and taking it without full awareness of efficacy or safety. That's your choice. If there is no evidence to support that cannabis oil cures cancer, admit it.

5836 2018-08-15 13:13:32 Have to disagree. Before our involvement a few years back in foreign wars for oil there were zero incidents in the UK. And if Islam were the problem we'd all be dead by now. Like saying Catholicism was the problem re: IRA.

5875 2018-08-15 13:09:30 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
5876 2018-08-15 13:09:30 true! I guess I think of aioli as specific to mediterranean cuisine since "an emulsion of mayo/oil and spices" could describe sauces from a bunch of different cultures.

5902 2018-08-15 13:06:56 WAR is never the answer - you have OIL - that’s the reason the USA plays nice with you. Canada is an awesome country full of peaceful people.  No reason for SA to mess with them only b/c they are standing up to Human Rights abuses by your country and others. They don’t care.

6033 2018-08-15 12:52:49 And yet they've expressed interest in funding a base in AFG, have stepped up border presence and contacts with Tajikistan, etc. The SCS does not correlate to the specifics of the security situation in AFG. China's also energy hungry and needs oil, so why would they adhere?

6035 2018-08-15 12:52:44 People are not asking the question re: what plant-based actually is. The composition of a #beef burger is healthier in terms of fat content than a plant-based burger using coconut oil as its foundation. Plant-based doesn’t mean healthy. - @irwinadam #CDNBeefConf #cdnag #food
6036 2018-08-15 12:52:37 It’s probable that the health and safety folk would condemn it - it would be like an oil slick inside the booth 
6037 2018-08-15 12:52:33 There is nothing better than a warm bath to feel relaxed - I love a splash of lavender oil and some magnesium salts in mine and of course a nice fluffy towel ready for when I get out! #NationalRelaxationDay
6038 2018-08-15 12:52:25 So my doctor said it’s okay for my baby to come any time now. I been bouncing on my yoga ball and doing a little walking. What y’all do to get y’all baby out? DONT SAY CASTOR OIL.
6039 2018-08-15 12:52:13 Can I say I'm glad my postpartum massage is ending tomorrow? I'm not liking the feeling of being drenched in oil, param, tapel, pilis and whatnot for 24/7.
6040 2018-08-15 12:52:11 Also, since you've suggested it, where's your evidence that cannabis oil puts people into remission?
6041 2018-08-15 12:52:10 Anyone care to take a guess about the pollution of the B.C fires? Have they exceeded anything the oil sands could ever put out in a year? Enviro’s where are you? Don’t shy away from facts now...
6042 2018-08-15 12:52:09 I know we are capable of developing the land... I’m also in it, I’m running an essential oil project in a communal land.

That means the land has always been available for us to work it. Makes me wonder which land do people need and for what

I agree a a refinery will just order a grade of crude and have what ever is cheapest delivered. 
My point is if we had the infrastructure, Alberta oil would be the cheapest, there would be no reason to import oil.

Basically a dough made with milk, and you make little parcels of spinach filling - add 1 onion finely chopped and 60 ml each olive oil/lemon to the spinach (that was for 600g frozen). Soooo delicious!

6319 2018-08-15 12:17:16 It has multiplying effects. Car tyres, oil and spare parts have to be transported also.  Now calculate,  using your new price how it affects the above and how in turn affect the projected price. It's easier calculating than demonstrating against government where you may be shot.

6332 2018-08-15 12:15:26 .Andy Andy Andy your showing Canadians how the oil corporations have you in their pockets. Why do none of these companies build a refinery where the oil comes from? Because they know full well their days are numbered. Andy prefers dragging the whole country down when pipe leaks.

6344 2018-08-15 12:13:48 Except out oil is refined in the US and imported back in hence our expensive costs for gas..most countries that supply its own oil pay at least half...it’s why it’s never profitable to sell within your own country...money money money
6345 2018-08-15 12:13:38 Oil painting found in the National Portrait Gallery clearly depicts Jeremy Corbyn at a cemetery on Mars laying a wreath to the asteroids which wiped out the dinosaurs,it was painted in 1843, well might as well join in with the ridiculous eh 
6346 2018-08-15 12:13:34 I think your point is a refinery is going to order whatever is cheapest on the commodity market, they are going to treat light crude the same and not discriminate based on nation of origin. True, but Canadian crude is nearly $16 per barrel cheaper than foreign oil.

6360 2018-08-15 12:11:16 Not true, we can build the infrastructure so the only oil tankers coming in to Saint John are getting filled with Canadian crude, instead of delivering 300 million barrels of foreign crude per day.

6385 2018-08-15 12:08:44 I can tell you 100% of the oil refined in Strathcona is from North America (nearly all from Canada), nearly none of the oil refined at Irving is from Canada.  Oil tankers can't park in Edmonton, we are lacking the infrastructure to deliver oil from Alberta to New Brunswick.

6434 2018-08-15 12:02:02 The embargo had no effect on the state of Cuban buildings. It only prevents US from buying Cuban goods. Cuba has iron mines, cement & heavy oil for asphalt & tar & they’ve always been able to buy from the rest of the world. Socialism destroys wealth.

6438 2018-08-15 12:01:32 If you believe HRC would hold similar policies to Trump, then you are clueless. She wasn’t for selling off public lands to oil, family separation, trade wars, or huge tax cuts for the rich, etc. Your comments also included GOP and Never Trumpers, what is it about their policies?

6455 2018-08-15 11:59:30 Copper isn’t the harbinger of anything.  In theory, oil off 70% should have brought on chaos, but it didn’t.  These are just commodities.  They are volatile.

My larger point was, Donnie never tried to re-sell the snake oil; he called it out.

I was sparked by Joe claiming that "Trump's" economy is roaring, & Donny reminding Joe of GOP & debt. 

@Joenbc is still re-selling the snake oil.

6463 2018-08-15 11:58:43 That's true, but we also know that massive government interventions and subsidies of goods caused major inflation and weakened the currency, meaning the state had less money with which to run the budget. Saudi Arabia is likewise overly dependent on oil, but didn't collapse. Why?

6467 2018-08-15 11:58:12 You know we can't because they're propping up the dollar with oil sales and also keeping up their production to keep the price low to break Venezuela's back-while blaming it on "Socialism!", while SA is ruled by a freaking KING, which is somehow better.
6468 2018-08-15 11:58:01 I used to use jojoba oil as a base oil for massages, and even as a night time moisturiser on my fave, as it is a really light oil. Maybe that’s something you could try? :)

6561 2018-08-15 11:43:59 Great win and we’re rolling! Yesterday was Two-for-Tuesday and the @Braves scored 10 runs...which means YOU score $20 off a full-service oil change today. Come on in and ask for the Braves' discount!

6563 2018-08-15 11:43:32 When did the change from oil tycoon to 50s greaser occur?
6564 2018-08-15 11:43:19 Renewable oil? No such thing and workers on renewables need a whole new skill set from Oil Workers. No need to exclusively concentrate on renewables just get rid of the mindless hate. Some of my family are in the Oil Industry and find work globally. Ie Singapore and Australia.

6573 2018-08-15 11:42:01 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
6574 2018-08-15 11:41:54 My bad the coals come separate in small discs. The “incense” comes in small crystals.. You get a small oil burner . Ignite the charcoal over a fire. Place on oil burner. Then place crystal(s) on hot charcoal
6575 2018-08-15 11:41:50 (2) A small crew is working with Suit-Kote on Westwood Road in the Towns of Alden and Lancaster helping with traffic control for a fog seal on our Oil + Chip surface. Last but not least, two mowers will be out on Three Rod and Bullis Roads in the Towns of Alden, Elma and Marilla.

6589 2018-08-15 11:38:49 Mmm...A few years ago when we hit £1.40 a litre the price of oil was about $140 a barrel..A few weeks ago it's was $77 a barrel yet the prices have soared..they say it's all related to the £ versus the $..I wonder or is it the government making sure it stays high.

6606 2018-08-15 11:36:50 The major trigger/catalyst was 9/11. That was the largest terror attack full stop. Thousands dead and injured on western soil, which was a jihad (religious) attack. Bush/Blair then went in after WMDs and al-queda. There are other factors. Oil. Money. Land. But not so influential

6608 2018-08-15 11:36:30 Trudeau by moving the goal posts for pipeline approvals has done exactly that.  There is no reason for a country with the second (or third) largest oil reserves in the world to be importing billions of dollars of oil a year from anyone. Saudi Arabia in-particular.
6609 2018-08-15 11:36:28 All these local govt staffs be feeling like they work in an oil company
6610 2018-08-15 11:36:25 Yes but think about this. If we were to focus all of our efforts into finding out how to obtain the renewable energy, then we would have less energy getting the oil we are using now, because most of the workers working the oil fields would then work on getting the renewable oil.

6634 2018-08-15 11:31:51 Ingesting artificial oils is dangerous yes, but like I said they’re 100% natural. Oils are made out of plants,you can eat the plant, you can ingest the oil. If it’s from a plant that humans should not ingest then the label clearly states you shouldnt

6659 2018-08-15 11:29:02 Well quit importing people then! in the 60s we had 8 million people and people were recommended to emigrate. Now there are 18 million people and the Dutch government keeps importing people as part of a oil deal in the 70s with the arabs
6660 2018-08-15 11:29:01 Hey let's see how long you can keep a Council seat with an environment message separate and no economic message. Case in point not everyone voted Frieze because of peak oil.

6661 2018-08-15 11:28:55 Well that's what you said. "Use our own oil in the asouth East"  My comment holds. Renewables are being ignored and The US is falling behind because of oil and coal magnates being favoured by Trump in exchange for their money.

6694 2018-08-15 11:25:31 You don't think about CPI(M). Oil your own machine.Dr sujan chakraborty tweets "All time low price of rupees" and this is happening today. So before commenting on any post, please read the news carefully
6695 2018-08-15 11:25:28 Hopefully the clattery goes away. All the same, you may want to check your oil level again tonight or just take it in for an oil change and filter.

6697 2018-08-15 11:24:55 Inverted yield curve is more due to the long end not breaking out. 6 years now that I have said the 10 year yield won't break over 3%, as long as the Fed keeps pushing rates higher, yields will invert. A lot of this is due to global PMI's and oil prices, which have held up
6698 2018-08-15 11:24:37 다행이에요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
6699 2018-08-15 11:24:26 Did I say ,”This is for the southeast only?” No, I said it’s great that there is an oil source in the southeast, because I live in the southeast. I didn’t mean for it to sound like this is excluding everyone else.

6702 2018-08-15 11:24:17 Oil demand from Asia's biggest importers, China and India, is growing more slowly than expected, exposing weakness in two of the world's largest economies and eroding a key pillar of global petroleum prices amid trade tensions.

6706 2018-08-15 11:23:48 Your money saving tip of the day: make it at home. Toast a slice of Italian or French bread, brush it with olive oil, layer on sliced avocado, sprinkle with crushed red pepper and salt and drizzle a little more olive oil on top.  So easy, so good.

6708 2018-08-15 11:23:39 Wrong, cause fracking is already here and the low production costs make many fields in north sea uncompetitive .

For evidence, look only at the usa. Now a net EXPORTER of oil 

Reason = only fracking

Is that as dangerous as pasteurised unicorn sweat, because that’s definitely on my list to avoid.
6713 2018-08-15 11:22:57 US stock futures are off 0.6% with both Asia and Europe also lower. Gold has dropped to $1,192 with oil at $66.17. Markets are needing some strong coffee.

6717 2018-08-15 11:22:27 I exfoliated with brown sugar, coconut oil, and honey so I feel soft, sweet, and delicious
6718 2018-08-15 11:22:22 Aibo what's cooking oil 
6719 2018-08-15 11:22:14 But seriously, this is a ridiculous take. Boom/bust players are real, and so are guys like Michael Thomas are who all but guaranteed to put up a similar stat line week-to-week.

It’s not snake oil. It’s easily verifiable statistics.

6724 2018-08-15 11:21:23 The JV partners are constantly drilling and having successful development wells and increasing the oil reserves and thus value of the oil land but this is a slow & steady process which I think the market finds boring

6727 2018-08-15 11:21:05 The recipe I saw had them tossed in a little oil and seasoning. I forgot. So I took half of them out again, and did that, to see what the difference is. Some were sliced super thin on the cheese grater, the others as thin as I could with a knife. Will be testing soon,
6728 2018-08-15 11:20:56 Yes :p I renovated my home myself actually so I’ve done everything myself. Or well I just repainted the cabinets and such, but that took 1w due to a lot of hassle bc original paint was oil paint which needed to be heated and scraped off etc :D

6742 2018-08-15 11:18:54 I think she will try and defer until 2021. With rising oil prices and production mini peak expected then, our deficit will be as low as possible. We just saw reduction in EU workers which increases worker shortage and pay so she will back track on demanding EU FOM by then.

6843 2018-08-15 11:03:48 Cry Me a River...

I had a 11 AM appointment for an Oil Change and they didn't get it done for 2.5 hours. 

At one point my car hood up was up for 30 minutes and the guy was on a smoke break.

6845 2018-08-15 11:03:33 You can send another to buy you oil. Mozambique you just go and they will be waiting for you. The catch is that you have to spill blood now and again if you don't your family will be wiped off. Also your wealth won't transcend generations
6846 2018-08-15 11:03:33 @KelloggsUK I love your Fruit n Fibre. Having tested a number of supermarket own cereals yours is by far the best. The only problem is the occasional taste of oil which is weird in milk

6849 2018-08-15 11:03:23 It was taken down because people knew it was a subtle threat.

I know Canada has made arms deals with them in the past. Hopefully they stop.

Hopefully they do impose a tax on their oil along with sanctions.

6857 2018-08-15 11:01:08 4- they see the potential not only in dealing with each other, which is massive! But they actually want to make all of the oil sales to be done more efficiently and in matter of seconds instead of weeks using xrp. This is a potential of $150B a month

6890 2018-08-15 10:56:45 Yes! There's a great Rachel Roddy recipe for spinach and ricotta gnudi, or else something I love as a side is spinach that's been blanched, refreshed, squeezed, & then chopped & mixed with good Greek yoghurt, minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, s&p. Amazing as a dip/condiment!

6901 2018-08-15 10:55:40 Those figures are mental. I don't think even saudia Arabia or Russia even make that much from oil. Norway doesn't! How can you not question this nonsense for yourself?
6902 2018-08-15 10:55:34 What will happen when oil doesn't trade so high anymore? If Nigeria as a state breaks up who will pay? What is the estimated borrowing /plan for the next 10 years? What others means of revenues aside taxing the already poor are in place? So many questions

6918 2018-08-15 10:54:16 Surprise surprise! Certainly the current oil price has been quite favorable & indeed average prices over the last 24 months. At least technocrats like these don't degenerate to inane innuendoes & base politics. What's the debt strategy going forward though?

6951 2018-08-15 10:51:10 IMO, most of the return in 2010-2013 were made due to extra-ordinary oil discoveries. Since then, hardly have seen any mega oil hit. I still, believe EMH in UK is unaffected. it is mostly risk-adjusted return. or "inside info" can be one of the factor for abnormal return.

6972 2018-08-15 10:48:47 Will reveal all as the #AbsaTop10Pinotage winners are announced. But first, a little wine and a starter of duck breast, mango puree, sweetcorn, coconut reduction and herb oil from the kitchen at @cavalliestate

6974 2018-08-15 10:48:13 I understand some states which are not even oil producing states have established systems of grants for law graduates proceeding to the Nigerian law school. What then is going on with the oil producing states including my state IMO?
6975 2018-08-15 10:48:11 With oil the best way is to get together a local buying group. That is what we did 18 years ago and it has saved a fortune. We all pay by direct debit & we get 5% interest on amounts by which our accounts are in credit.
6976 2018-08-15 10:47:47 See the first one didn’t, without an hour of coaxing and half a bottle of nice bath oil. I vote that one goes back on, no matter how tight it was. 
6977 2018-08-15 10:47:42 Anxiety is the worst :/ meditation/breathing exercises help me a lot with it. CBD oil also really helps if you’re able to get some. It doesn’t have any THC so you won’t get high but it’s very relaxing and comforting

6979 2018-08-15 10:47:35 I would look at some of the individual packs like FatCoffee for travel.  Personally, I found @OrganifiJuice green juice + a scoop of protein to have a better effect than just MCT oil

6983 2018-08-15 10:47:04 Actually, scrap that: I've just realised the original graph doesn't include oil, gas etc. so the increase in total power consumption would not necessarily be as much as I thought. Doh!

6992 2018-08-15 10:46:05 Have you tried taking CBD oil instead? It doesn't have THC in it so it relaxes you without sending you on a ride.
6993 2018-08-15 10:46:00 Venezuela's economy collapsed because it was overly dependent on oil, and the return of Iran to the world supply markets exacerbated it. Since then, the economy has been badly mishandled, and it just gets worse. 1/

6997 2018-08-15 10:45:12 Import substitution will happen with certain products. Some big itsms like crude oil,gas,gold etc cannot be substituted but unlikely to have a inflationary impact as when dollar strengthens commodity prices reduce. Although some inflation cnt be ruled out.

7001 2018-08-15 10:44:50 Maybe but it also brings to the fore front that Canada needs to move its oil to the east so that we can stop relying on Saudi oil. So Trudeau had best make it happen. But he won’t.
7002 2018-08-15 10:44:45 it seem oil companies,  a cash cow
7003 2018-08-15 10:44:36 Scotland's GDP was £170bn in total, for the financial year 2017-18. Oil & Gas, remember that thing we couldn’t do without? Only accounted for £13.5bn, which in percentage terms is 12.59% #youyesyet

7005 2018-08-15 10:44:26 Time to oil up the shovels and find some lime.

7007 2018-08-15 10:44:05 Very few rural areas have mains gas. The only viable alternative to oil heating is an air source heat pump but that is a massive investment.
7008 2018-08-15 10:44:04 Not just Trump.. Bush also... It was after the Un speech when Chaves said he 'smelled brimstone'... Many wanted to invade... They are sitting on a huge stock of oil

Now they r allied with Americans and have stopped buying oil from Iran on their orders... US hegemony is incrsly contested
7014 2018-08-15 10:43:20 Don't worry as a net exporter of electricity and oil Scotland will not let you down. Even after Independence. That's only if WM don't put a hard border in place though. 
7015 2018-08-15 10:43:17 Very thoughtful. Is it possible a very motivated Saudi writes a big check because YOLO and can’t live on oil forever?
7016 2018-08-15 10:43:15 In that case the only hope the Turks have for their economic well being is the political power of Euro banks whose exposure/collapse/bailout would hurt politicians there in EU. Otherwise, they will be an Iran without oil

7027 2018-08-15 10:42:11 I was told a few years ago, by a pharmacist, that the rise in rapeseed cultivation was causing problems for asthma and hayfever sufferers.  I stopped buying even organic rapeseed oil.
7028 2018-08-15 10:42:03 @GeorgeMonbiot Turn your fire power onto this study. Your research will show that mice were fed a SEED OIL diet,  the resulting health disaster used to frame the argument that a low carb/ keto diet of natural fats CAUSES diabets. It is the reverse.

7032 2018-08-15 10:41:42 1. With Nigeria going through the sharpest fall of export revenue in her history, losing over $100 billion (N30 trillion) between 2015 and 2017 due to the crashing oil prices, resulting in a recession.
7033 2018-08-15 10:41:37 Nah, we dont have oil or nukes Donald wants oil and obidience Bow before the US Emperor 
7034 2018-08-15 10:41:35 Can't abide Olbas oil. Gives me a headache!
7035 2018-08-15 10:41:33 Our practice nurse does it. Oil for a few days helps. On holiday a French gp did my daughter’s ear with a fairy liquid bottle +warm water!

7040 2018-08-15 10:41:05 This is the beginning of alt power it will be many years/decades before lower demand for oil, (unless you know different) so prices will stay relatively high, they are looking at new ways to extract oil, fracking, so demand isn't going to decrease in the foreseeable future
7041 2018-08-15 10:41:01 I put strawberries and blueberries in the bottom of a bowl and put cooked quinoa on top and make a dressing of lime juice, local honey and olive oil. It’s breakfast for me everyday.  With a nice villa rose tea!
7042 2018-08-15 10:41:00 Hi, yes they're all vegans from birth. I was lucky as in the 90's there was a fortified soya formula made by Farleys, which was vegan. They had that until going onto regular plant milks. I gave them chewable multi vits & added hemp oil to foods, often, but not daily

7064 2018-08-15 10:37:01 Not sure where you get those stupid figures from but lets look at your first statement. You say we get £200 million from oil. That translates to UKGov getting £2.2 Billion. We actually get £30 billion back under Barnett. We send £45 billion to HMRC in taxes, VAT etc.

7081 2018-08-15 10:34:14 I know. Saying as it isn't legally binding + the US is supporting old oil money gives them incentives to do the same. Policy isn't decided by the people, but a few vested interests everywhere right?

7091 2018-08-15 10:33:13 200 million we get from oil now , we received 13,000 million pounds from Barnett , that's 12,800 million pounds  we are better off . How do you propose to fill that shortfall after independence ?
7092 2018-08-15 10:33:10 Are you seriously going to trust COMPANY people to inspect that pipeline and take THEIR word for it. Isn't there anyone that isn't a shareholder or on payroll to inspect it. Remember how long oil was leaking into ocean in the gulf coast before anyone knew besides COMPANY PEOPLE.

7110 2018-08-15 10:29:48 Yeah, so, since cranberries are essentially hollow they flood the bogs at harvest time and the ripe berries float. They round them up with booms, kind like what they use to clean oil spills, and them suck them up.

7122 2018-08-15 10:27:39 In other words: Alyse Galvin really means her husband Patrick's big oil company Great Bear Petroleum is the largest exploration leaseholder in the North Slope, and she will make sure nothing stands in the way of her family profiting off of wrecking the environment in the #ANWR...
7123 2018-08-15 10:27:20 Agree but at the same time just think which so called ally of ours is providing all the arms to our enemy.Azerbaijan gets billions in oil revenue, and its people still live in poverty.Armenia does not have such export but still managed to free some territories.Unity is key.Amen

7132 2018-08-15 10:25:55 The assumption you make is; the only cost going up for the matatu operators is fuel consumed per trip, which may not be accurate. The cost of other consumables like engine oil, tyres etc will go up. Perhaps look at inflationary adjustments in the pricing as well
7133 2018-08-15 10:25:55 Whoever is refining the oil are benefiting a lot.

7142 2018-08-15 10:24:27 Alyse Galvin has the policies of a Republican, and her run is with the goal of keeping a real Democrat off the ballot in November. She supports #ANWR drilling and the big oil company where her husband is a top executive is the largest North Slope exploration leaseholder. Scammer!

7145 2018-08-15 10:24:20 Market cap is irrelevant. An example is this. Saudi Aramco oil reserve is held at 260B barrels, at today's market price of $66.00 is worth over $17T USD. That's 1 company. So what? Means nothing.

re: economy
This is PBO's economy & voters know it.

Educated voters know that Rs refused to stimulate for Obama but blew the budget for Trump.

Why do y'all buy his snake oil & then try to re-sell it to us?

End of year 5%+ dividend to be paid out. Surely this is enough proof the revenue is real and liquid!!!
7165 2018-08-15 10:22:38 If you folk are serious about palm oil you should address your concerns to UK charities like Inst of Chem Eng that support it, have whole sub groups devoted to it, and yet claim to be for "public benefit"

7205 2018-08-15 10:17:09 The markets moved higher throughout yesterday’s session due to a rising demand, before a late drop in the Oil market erased some of these gains. The weakness in the Oil market came in response to the inventory report which indicated a surprise build up of US Crude stockpiles.

7329 2018-08-15 09:59:16 as i understand it Nuclear is a bridge at best.

7330 2018-08-15 09:59:14 Oil cleanser, second cleanse if you can be bothered (I cannot), maybe some Pixi Glow a few times a week, serum and moisturiser, maybe a few drops of oil if you fancy. Origins Drink Up Intensive is a nice fuss-free mask to do overnight now and again.

7355 2018-08-15 09:54:25 Over a lifetime, a detached home in a place where it snows in the winter uses about as much fuel as a Falcon 9 rocket (which runs on almost the same fuel). Relative to oil, natural gas is only about 25% less carbon per BTU. So, three Boston-Bangkok round trips instead of four.
7356 2018-08-15 09:54:18 Additionally may I ask if the wrapping of your multipack cans or the cans themselves are made using tallow or any other animal product or derivative of one, or any derivative of the oil palm plant, or rice or any derivative of rice, or any GMO or derivative of any GMO?

Exactly the same effect on oil price

Effect = lower demand for oil 
   
Which = LOWER PRICE FOR OIL

7405 2018-08-15 09:47:09 politicians care about their pockets at the expense of national sovereignty and stability. Be it Al Qaeda, the east/west (ironically the west is always seen imposing itself where there is oil and gas). Multinational organizations who stand to gain are also part of the problem.

7961 2018-08-15 07:56:08 There is something really not adding up here . In 2008 when the global price of oil was higher our petrol was cheaper. In 2018 when the price is much lower we are paying more at the pump all this while the shilling is also stronger against the dollar.

7965 2018-08-15 07:55:11 This Malabu scandal was too painful for me. It signaled the end of my support for GEJ’s administration. Undervalued an oil well from $500billion dollars to $1billion dollars bcs of corruption. I wept when I read this story!

7967 2018-08-15 07:54:46 Oil refineries don't blow up because there is a safe ops system - rather than relying on one Engineer.

Patient safety depends on a safe system of work in an #NHS environment. That's not just individual Drs but enough nurses, £, functioning IT, time for shift handovers and so on.
7968 2018-08-15 07:54:20 Oil surged up much faster during 2005-08. Why didn't rupee depreciate then? The sharp fall was primarily due to terrible economic mismanagement- yawning fiscal deficit and double digit inflation. Oil has moved >40% in last 18 months - how come infln under control and depn modest?

7993 2018-08-15 07:49:43 All thise clamouring about good for exports dont realise that it is bad for imports which we do more & particularly oil which already has become more expensive & now the depreciated rupee will make it costlier.

8023 2018-08-15 07:43:09 Canada could quickly recoup the loss of exports to #KSA by unlocking our oil, which is currently land-locked in Alberta. Not to mention fully opening up free trade with America. Slashing taxes and cutting foreign aid would add billions to our economy. Just saying.

8034 2018-08-15 07:41:39 As per your own chart, last time we had this much trade deficit, rupee was at 68 and crude was 100+. Now crude is at 72 and rupee is at 70. We are in no way better than what we were 5 yrs back. We had some good yrs in between when rupee was strong and oil was low.

8083 2018-08-15 07:32:41 i feel like "natural oils" is a misnomer
if i were to play devil's advocate and say they aren't predominately a scam, then the parts of it that actually do anything are the oil's non-oil impurities. hmm. wonder if they sell "pure natural oil" too?
8084 2018-08-15 07:32:37 Before calling someone's tweet 'nonsense' plz realize you are using similar partial data.
Rupee was stable between 40-45 for many years, before it suddenly went to 60s in 2013.
Oil was at $115 when that happened. Want to take bet where Rupee would be now, if oil goes there again?

8116 2018-08-15 07:26:07 To get total Independence, we must be self sustained, free ourselves from dependence on imports; energy, health & defence needs. Priority must be on supply of crude oil, developing sustainable, affordable technologies to mitigate adverse impact of unpredictable  crude oil prices.
8117 2018-08-15 07:25:41 Really beautiful! Hopefully it will get more people to turn around the packaging and see whats in their products? I haven't had palm oil for maybe a year (which means... no japanese curry and none of my fave ramens either).Side note: I find the animation error at 1:14 distracting

8213 2018-08-15 07:07:38 Lmao, you cannot shoot crack, it’s not water soluble. If somehow you managed to get the oil into your veins, it would turn back into a solid  & kill ya. You can only shoot cocaine in its powder/salt form.

8355 2018-08-15 06:42:18 Logiskt strategiskt om IPC skulle förvärva Africa oil. Men till vilken premie? Menar dom allvar så kan dom mycket väl betala aktieägare för exit. Får se hur marknaden reagerar i o med dagens resultat. Spontant känns kursen spekulativ.
8356 2018-08-15 06:42:13 Real prices. According to their financial statements, European oil companies assume long-term prices between $70-80 per barrel from 2020/21 rising at 2% per annum to reflect inflation.
8357 2018-08-15 06:42:09 The difference is spending your own money, earned via football, versus spending your sugar daddy's cash, earned via oil revenue.
8358 2018-08-15 06:42:02 Are you thick we don’t get the oil the rich have it
8359 2018-08-15 06:41:55 I am may be behind u I am going to my oil mill at IMO rivers the road used to block on a daily so I normally take bike from eleme junction to oyigbo before I take aba bus

8362 2018-08-15 06:41:38 Only thing I know now that is "virgin " is olive oil. And I here most of that if fake !

8367 2018-08-15 06:40:41 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.

8371 2018-08-15 06:40:23 Not all women I’ve had to know how to change my oil, tires, and jump my car since I was 12. Checking my oil, and tire pressure, & coolant is an everyday thing

8374 2018-08-15 06:39:39 Has Rex Tillerson figured out how to drink OIL  yet?   #Keepitintheground
8375 2018-08-15 06:39:37 You’d be better off using facts, not fiction. Growth rates are net of inflation. UPA had to weather the greatest economic crisis the world has seen since Great Depression. Oil prices at record high. No comparison, & no excuses for BJP non-performance.

8386 2018-08-15 06:38:37 It is shameful for #Canada to interfere in others internal affairs. U don't like it? Stop selling arms to them...stop importing oil from them.  Double standards doesn't make U a great nation. They r a copy of their big brother down south.
8387 2018-08-15 06:38:26 A little olive oil and a dash of cream doesn’t go astray. 
8388 2018-08-15 06:37:49 Looks like there is diesel or oil on the road heading from Inverkeithing up past Fordell Firs towards Crossgates! Wednesday 0735
8389 2018-08-15 06:37:44 I wear glasses and yes pain in the ass too clean but I try to soak them in hot water and that does a good job at cleaning them up. It even loosen up the oil dirt and other crap on the nose guards and makes them easier too clean.

8401 2018-08-15 06:36:05 Bought some lightbulbs here a couple of years ago, before the olive oil. Why did I move out of this neighbourhood? Oh right - so I wouldn't be living in a basement.

8406 2018-08-15 06:35:18 I've reviewed breakevens for major new oil sands projects. Look at Keystone XL approval and Kinder Morgan. Show me business case for >1million bpd more pipeline capacity. Didn't other new pipelines help kill Energy East? Such bpd from new projects would come at an economic loss.
8407 2018-08-15 06:35:02 I love peppermint oil 
8408 2018-08-15 06:34:55 I understand the difference. Fracking for natural gas as opposed to drilling for oil. I suppose I'm fortunate. I rarely drive my car. I run/ walk everywhere. I'm vegetarian and grow my own and haven't purchased anything major in years.
8409 2018-08-15 06:34:49 Irish Boiled Eggs: Add 1/4 fl oz of ribs, 2/3 squirts of fish oil & 2/3 boxes of bacon bits to a cooking pot. Pat down with hand and enjoy!
8410 2018-08-15 06:34:47 I’ve seen this done , lemon washing up liquid looks very similar to cooking oil , can’t comment on the taste though

8419 2018-08-15 06:32:29 18:29 goes on to say that a fire is prepared for those who don't believe, and they shall be given oil (or molten lead, in some translations) to drink. That doesn't sound very nice.
And 2:256 is abrogated by 9:5, which says that you either follow Islam or pay the jizya.
8420 2018-08-15 06:32:28 Obama was successful in polarizing a nation instead of bring blacks and whites closer he pushed them further away. He did a lousy way of improving employment, handcuffing industries that are important to this country, oil drilling Alaska, Gulf, pipeline imports. He gave us zero!

8434 2018-08-15 06:27:56 I’ve heard people say before that putting something like salmon oil (really tasty and strong smell to help engage them) on the food can help. I sometimes mix treats into one of ours who is super picky at times though she’s been known to eat all the treats and leave the food 
8435 2018-08-15 06:27:43 ぽ！今日も一日がんばってこー！
8436 2018-08-15 06:27:32 It was my understanding that not only do we have reserves but a lot of capped wells brimming with oil. Is this not true?
8437 2018-08-15 06:27:28 I haven't tried CBD oil but I'm thinking about trying it for breakthrough anxiety. I just worry it'll make me throw up. Someone at Pride spilled their bottle where I was working and after a while I had to leave bc the smell was so bad.

Also @MeliDraws CBT is crap and I hate it.

raw vegans: this is my recipe it's made from uncooked potatoes and beets it has no oil no salt no gluten no seasoning and is served on top of room temperature cucumber slices
8445 2018-08-15 06:25:34 I've done some research on this because I'm a nut about food quality. I use Nordic Naturals for Fish Oil. But Garden of Life has a vegan algae DHA, which is pretty awesome, and I use a lot of their other vitamins. And, psst, they are both Magento merchants...
8446 2018-08-15 06:25:19 @IngrahamAngle Swedes, Danes, and Finns in America average a 55% better standard of living than those in Sweden, Denmark or Finland.  The only one that comes even close is Norway, but when the oil and gas gravy train peters out, that will be the end of it.

8451 2018-08-15 06:24:10 Hi hello.

I’ve been doing an oil pull every morning with coconut oil, otherwise brushing normally. I also use apple cider vinegar every couple days as a mouth wash.
8452 2018-08-15 06:24:08 Basic commodities prices on raise , we will accept and move on, the gap between the poor and rich is widening each day. Why are we exporting crude oil while we have changamwe refinery?
8453 2018-08-15 06:23:58 Ask for the Oil. Lights better and the scent is heavenly.

You are choosing very idiotic behavior. 
Do some research outside the regressive bubble you are in. Fascism is an ultra right ideology; you are wrong

8526 2018-08-15 06:12:15 Yep. That’s exactly what he’s saying. You’re right. Ignore the others. They can’t seem to extrapolate because they follow the cons hoping for more oil money.

"IF" is the Hinge and where you find the oil to open THAT door, may God bless THAT "version".
8571 2018-08-15 06:04:49 Of course, hard core Bhakts like you would like to ignore the Crude oil prices during 2009-13 compared to those in the current regime. Modi Bhakts can review their old tweets and see how their Swami has let them down. But, that would be too much to ask from RW journalists!
8572 2018-08-15 06:04:48 The bigger story is how did we get here? How is Trump still President? How did people fall for a crooked snake oil salesman who is living off our dime and enriching his goon friends even more?
8573 2018-08-15 06:04:47 There should be a word for the unique feeling of relief a user of public transportation feels when the liquid on their seat turns out to be an oil or coolant that's leaked from the vehicle.
8574 2018-08-15 06:04:34 As for oil : no, oil as no much value today, Canada and US have ramped up oil production since 2003 and are nearly oil self sufficient. Oil is no more a motive for war.
But kicking the asses of definitively IS is ! For all SAA, SDF, USA.

8644 2018-08-15 05:51:42 Yes but dependent on the company. Most see not using palm oil as a selling point so anyone that simply states vegetable oil has something to hide (in my opinion).
8645 2018-08-15 05:51:41 It’s pretty normal to have oily hair when you don’t wash it too often. Those oils are protecting your hair and making it healthier. I have really curly hair, and so don’t wash mine too much. I also put an oil in it to help control the curls.

8655 2018-08-15 05:48:48 I doubt the humans will listen. They're running towards extinction yapping about oil and profits. Water doesn't occur to them as the more important resource to conserve. Sad for the lizard. Didn't know that they didn't have ears.
8656 2018-08-15 05:48:32 I just came off Zoloft a couple months ago but have never found an anxiety med I could take. I've heard about cbd oil but have never bought it or even know where to get it. Do you recommend a site to learn more?

8690 2018-08-15 05:43:01 10 billion humans don’t need to drive cars...that’s the point. “Peak oil” doesn’t happen without generalized commodity production, speculative investments, and perpetual growth doctrine, which only exist under capitalism
8691 2018-08-15 05:42:54 I worked on a reservation in #Alberta a few years back. First Nations people get oodles of $$ from oil companies. They know what side their bread is buttered!
8692 2018-08-15 05:42:51 If water was treated like oil you would have man-made rivers and water pipelines all over the place and water would cost $8 a gallon since we need water more then oil.

8711 2018-08-15 05:38:26 A clean energy standard could be a helpful policy but there is a misalignment in the political strategy here: we are going to give oil companies liability protection in exchange for imposing an obligation on the utility sector? Why would that be viable?

8847 2018-08-15 05:12:10 Or when they cheat: the Fraser Institute is cagey to admit it pads its numbers by counting every tax conceivable in its “overall tax bill of the average Canadian family,”  including corporate taxes and royalties paid by oil and gas companies.
8848 2018-08-15 05:11:50 I guess you don't have that much longer to breathe the air or drink the water on this planet, or at least not enough to give a rats ass about those cut regulations. Spewing oil into the oceans and smog into the air and killing the wildlife on earth. But I have kids, who have kids
8849 2018-08-15 05:11:42 It seems that they did not see that a sitting US president could get rid of the deal if he wanted to. They cared more about being able to sell oil & repatriate the money & not much about foreign investments.
8850 2018-08-15 05:11:10 For highly rated catcher, Grandal sure is pretty atrocious at hanging on to throws. Like he has Wesson oil in his glove.
8851 2018-08-15 05:11:03 Saudis have been working since last 10 yrs to fully hedge their oil economy with investments in future tech.

8857 2018-08-15 05:09:18 100% Adam. Those numbers excl any debt repayments when they prod SC from 2019 & early ramp up. Even if you lower price deck the multiple is low. I do however think earlier talk of EV/EBITDA multiples of 15x are too high. Quality oil companies trade at 6-8x
8858 2018-08-15 05:09:14 Oil is to water as deplorables are to facts. It's pointless.

8929 2018-08-15 04:54:12 VERY disappointing for those who worked their asses off for years in this country as well as the farming community and oil + gas industry! This is a huge risk and going to affect future generations terribly! It’s completely IRRESPONSIBLE of @JustinTrudeau
8930 2018-08-15 04:53:41 @CNBCTV18Live 
I asked rosneft they said they never gave any money 13 bn$ 90000 crores ₹ to buy essar oil which essar ruias are saying to pay all essar companies 90000 crores  bank debt. India  Banks should sell essar oil other essar companies to get money

8936 2018-08-15 04:51:53 What a great job by Laura, once again exposing the Left's thirst for state control over enterprise. 
Elizabeth Bruenig advocates for state control of industry & people's lives. Scary! 

Norway is the size of Dallas-Fort Worth area, almost no military, surrounded by oil.

8943 2018-08-15 04:51:03 A strong dollar not only helps US but also helps China and indian Exporters. And if we reduce our dependence on Oil and Gold, it really does not matter.

8958 2018-08-15 04:48:52 Record number of For Sale signs everywhere I look in Calgary. Oil prices no longer drive a recovery in what was a vibrant city. Rigs continue to leave Canada.

8967 2018-08-15 04:46:57 As for why they're in a crisis, that's down to a combination of the fall in world oil prices, problems arising from the variable exchange rate introduced by Chavez in 2003, and the counter-productivity of Maduro's efforts to remedy the crisis through devaluation.

8987 2018-08-15 04:44:07 I get home and my uncle runs to me and says “TURN OFF YOUR CAR” apparently I’ve been driving without oil for at least today (probably longer like a week) and I probably could’ve died in my 40 min commute home today. #thegirlwholived
8988 2018-08-15 04:43:34 This reminds me of the parable of the 10 virgins in Matthew 25. “There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise [virgin]; but a foolish [virgin] man spends it up” (Proverbs 21:20)
8989 2018-08-15 04:43:27 okay, I just took a look at the recipe instead of going "ohhhh, jupang is kitchen in Korean and that's so similar to Chinese..." and... one can of corn to the equivalent of 5 tbsp of oil is WAY too much. That's not even counting cheese. I'd say try to go for 2 tbsp AT MOST.

9011 2018-08-15 04:40:24 I think the market views BRK as a boring play that should eventually pay off long term with their oil land acquisition strategy

What the market wants with small cap oilers is high impact drilling which BRK lacks

They need a 20% stake in a conventional high impact oil/Gas well

9017 2018-08-15 04:38:34 My dad just spent the last 30 minutes telling me how to find the sticker with my miles on it and what they mean. And then lectured me on the importance of not running out of oil.

9019 2018-08-15 04:37:37 When you analyse the science of oil and gas extraction, you will find this issue. Not taking care of the science involved is a killer and it comes in many ways. In the Netherlands it is a science to keep salt water at bay. (remember we are below sea level).

9030 2018-08-15 04:36:36 Try to keep calories up and make sure you’re getting enough fat. Avocado, coconut oil and nuts are good sources of fat, legumes will help with calories, protein and fibre. If you can source ethical eggs, keep them in, even if you eventually want to eliminate them. It’s a process!
9031 2018-08-15 04:36:21 I only had issues with mine at the very end when it had 300,000 miles, as long as you get regular oil changes they should be good, but I do know there are certain parts that are relatively expensive

Works great with TPMS sensors and modern long oil change interval vehicles where you don't check pressure as often bc it stays in the tires.

9056 2018-08-15 04:32:41 Building a good oil property portfolio for the long game is great but as you can see by the share price is not really supported or appreciated by the market

Why not compliment this with a meaningful stake in some high impact exploration drilling?

9078 2018-08-15 04:29:52 Oil and gas is far from dead !
Electricity is generated in different mixes in different countries.
Saudi is not quite like liberal Norway though.
Take the green stuff if they can stump it up.
Will watch this one...
9079 2018-08-15 04:29:48 ...I'm honestly baffled why they made cooking 150 but the first 50 you can literally just skill up by buying goods from the 'general supplies' seller near the cooking trainer. 

Also why you can convert fish to aromatic oil when its stupidly cheap to buy in bulk anyway??

9082 2018-08-15 04:29:39 I honestly care less about whether she’s Muslim, and more about whether she’s a good person

If she starts bending to Big Pharma/Oil etc. while in office, that will be much more significant than whichever God she wants to pray to

9084 2018-08-15 04:29:23 Saying mayonnaise is good because you can mix it with tons of stuff to make fun aiolis is like saying chlorine gas is good because it makes salt when combined with sodium. Yes, oil and eggs are a base for many recipes! Not the point.
9085 2018-08-15 04:29:19 If there is one myth novice fantasy players can get sucked into like rubes by the various charlatans out there it is this: consistency matters.

The truth is there is no such thing as consistency. Consistency is a myth, and those peddling it are selling snake oil.

9095 2018-08-15 04:27:49 4...Turkey refuses to not only lower the oil import quota from Iran also severe ties with the country. Consequently, Friday's announcement of the presidential candidate pairs, as today's editorial has eloquently put it, has more credibility than this so-called Turkish crisis.
9096 2018-08-15 04:27:44 How dare you suggest I change my own oil! Do I look like I know how to human to you?!

9102 2018-08-15 04:26:54 Do not think that love, in order to be genuine, has to be extraordinary. How does a lamp burn? .... Through the continuous input of small drops of oil. What are these drops of oil in our lamps? .... They are the small things of daily life.

9113 2018-08-15 04:24:37 We need 2 remember that Kissinger signed a pact with wahabi kingdom in da 70s, demanding they sell oil in USD, in returning 4 protection 1
9114 2018-08-15 04:24:36 When God provides for himself; ‘The LORD said to Samuel, "...Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons."’ 1 Samuel 16:1
9115 2018-08-15 04:24:35 Norway is a great country and was (is) 99% hydro power for electricity.
Could drown in wind and/or biomass power too.
Drowning in oil and gas.
Electricity is generated in different countries, differing mix.
Even with wind/solar the power stations run.

9215 2018-08-15 04:12:13 I have to rub my cast iron skillets down with oil then let them bake for a hour, then cool for at least two until I have 6 coats of oil baked on. (It helps make food stick less)

9228 2018-08-15 04:10:06 Good point. I’m not the hugest fan of oil for certain uses, but I agree Cdns can do pretty much anything better than most.
9229 2018-08-15 04:09:58 What about the 3 hour oil change? I thought that would be the highlight!
9230 2018-08-15 04:09:56 ぐうわかる
9231 2018-08-15 04:09:41 Looks lovely. My brother-in-law taught me how to make his dressing: a drizzle each of olive oil, maple syrup, and balsamic vinegar. Mix and pour.
9232 2018-08-15 04:09:19 マックのCMの「野菜もしっかり食べよう」ってコーンが出てくるやつ、毎度「穀物やないかーい！」って思っちゃう。「野菜」と言うのならせめて、コールスローサラダとかにしないのかなぁ。
9233 2018-08-15 04:09:17 Please count Norway out of that list. The fact that is has put its oil wealth into its pension fund does not make that successful market economy socialist.

Me: wut...
Him: You smell like a pastry.
M: Like food?
H: Yeah.
M: (remembering his favorite pastries) My toner has rose oil in it. Are you craving Baklava?
H: That would be it.

9244 2018-08-15 04:06:53 The trade deficit widened to a 5-year high, with exports contracting sequentially, and oil and gold imports rising...Lower core imports reflected some softness in domestic demand.

9252 2018-08-15 04:05:57 Then throw them in a bowl with 1tbsp of oil of your choice. Mix well. Then about 3 tsp of cornstarch. Mix well. Then place evenly on a non-stick baking sheet. 400* and it took mine 35 minutes! Once they’re real brown but not burned :)
9253 2018-08-15 04:05:44 Mayo is an emulsion of egg yolk (room temperature!) and oil, the clearer the better, carefully titrated with white vinegar or lemon juice as an emulsifier. It's quite fun to make.
9254 2018-08-15 04:05:40 I gave my cat a bath and rubbed her down with coconut oil. Now she won't even be in the same room as me.

9264 2018-08-15 04:04:09 There is a major achievement in the oil and gas sector that saved the sector from collapse. I hope the team will get credible people from all the sectors to contribute
9265 2018-08-15 04:03:55 Bake it: oven at 350 or 375 if you like crispy bits I usually coat in olive oil, 15 min, flip, 15 min each side

Pan fry: heat butter to bubbling in skillet over mediumish heat, cook 3-5 min on one side, flip over, 3-5 on the other

(If you didn’t intend to ask, apologies)
9266 2018-08-15 04:03:29 oil control ini bisa buat control harga pertamax sama pertalite gak? 
9267 2018-08-15 04:02:51 Isn’t it capitalism that motivates the oil & gas industry to continue extracting fossil fuel even though they knew about this result more than 40 yrs ago? Capitalism doesn’t take human rights or the environment into consideration, just shareholders & the bottom line. Facts.

9289 2018-08-15 03:58:20 Conditioner is perfectly fine and actually, putting it on your scalp will help counteract the excess oil production. Oil is what your scalp produces to try to moisturize itself, so conditioner is good to moisturize your scalp.

9307 2018-08-15 03:55:12 Use shampoo with NO sulfate. Sulfate strips your hair of good oils and so your scalp overproduces oil to compensate despite you using the conditioner, so ditch the shampoo with sulfate :)

9315 2018-08-15 03:54:35 - Dulu harga COAL cuman setengah harga OIL
- Meskipun COAL murah, orang tidak pake COAL karena POLUSI
- Kalo minyak naik diatas $80, orang baru pindah pake BATU BARA
- Karena RI kekurangan OIL dan kelebihan COAL maka PLN
  disuruh pake COAL yang SEKARANG MAHAL dan POLUTIF

9318 2018-08-15 03:54:12 Zinke hasn’t met an oil spill he doesn’t like. He’s a tool of big oil and gas, a cheerleader for multinational corporate destruction of the planet, and that’s the best thing that can be said about him.
9319 2018-08-15 03:54:04 “Bonsoy” (because healthier ingredients and no oil) or unsweetened almond milk (Inner Goodness from Aldi). In Australia.

9323 2018-08-15 03:53:00 I put too much oil on my face tonight
9324 2018-08-15 03:52:55 I'm sorry. I need to rewind here a little bit. I've heard siskind is a "leader of the resistance" and she's a "conservative republican" all in one conversation and all I can think of is oil and vinegar. One does not play well with the other.
9325 2018-08-15 03:52:52 The ordinary rosehip oil.
9326 2018-08-15 03:52:44 It took 4 rashes on my face for me to realize that I’m allergic to tea tree oil, I’m just trying to get rid of my dark blemishes :(
9327 2018-08-15 03:52:28 Nope my face is naturally oily so I use dry lotion to help but since my face been extra dry lately the tea tree oil by itself has been helping and I use it for scars
9328 2018-08-15 03:52:21 I’ve only ever said peanut oil
9329 2018-08-15 03:52:20 Sure, but you are advocating for government intervention in the oil and gas industry.  Companies will not do it on their own as it's a money loser.

9331 2018-08-15 03:52:19 LMAOOO they really just put a fried egg on their sketchbook and put colored pencils next to them for fun...

The next reply tweet with the oil on the paper says that they put it on their rice after and ate it LOL
9332 2018-08-15 03:52:13 did you know its completely legal to bust and piss in the fryers at Five Guys because they already have signs up warning ppl about the pee nut oil
9333 2018-08-15 03:52:03 @KaeElmer How can I let the alcohol of the pulverized C60 evaporate? In your video you say it evaporates overnight...but does that mean I pour it into a flask w oil, and then leave the flask open/fully exposed to air for a whole night? That makes me wonder, trying to verify..thx!

9341 2018-08-15 03:50:42 Great contribution to the topic.

So you blocked @verge because you think this one video is a Tesla add?  And I'm sure then that you just as outraged at the 50%+ saturation for commercials for oil and traditional car manufactures?

Is your short position hurting you recently?

9343 2018-08-15 03:50:40 It’s based on the analog, oil working methods of Harold Speed. His book Practice and Science of Drawing was a huge influence on me and it’s in public domain/older than dirt and free.

9445 2018-08-15 03:36:40 Yep and nope... as i clarified earlier i was commenting on the politics of oil ... not the Canadian resource base. Saudi Arabia is only important politically because because of oil. If they didn't have oil nobody would care about  them. Terrorism support aside.

9449 2018-08-15 03:36:03 Crisis of 2013?  Onion reaching high prices was due to high crude oil prices, causing the transport cost to increase leading to food inflation. In fact this govt has been lucky that oil prices have been lowest for a long time.

9528 2018-08-15 03:25:56 I don't have any great beef with oil companies selling oil BUT they all knew about climate change problems and covered it and many spread misinformation to slow down a transition.  Cost of electricity here was decades of mismanagement, nothing to do with clean energy that one.

9536 2018-08-15 03:24:07 As it de-emulsifies when you stir it in, this is just eggs and oil and is no longer mayo and is therefore acceptable to me, who cannot abide the thought of mayo.

9539 2018-08-15 03:23:47 Actually, you can either knit your own cloths/wipes, (or support someone off etsy (can choose someone local, so you get to support your own local economy too)) & diy your own wash solution (see pinterest): basically usually h20, some dishwashing soap & maybe vinegar+essential oil
9540 2018-08-15 03:23:46 So what is trump done? Well, please give him more arms to Saudi Arabia. He has done nothing to oust Assad, which was the original hope. Bottom line is that the Middle East has been a conundrum since we discovered oil there.
9541 2018-08-15 03:23:42 Oil and gas get billions in subsidies. Solar is experiencing exponential world wide growth and is now supplying power at <4 cents/kWh. Let’s stop throwing fuel on the fire.
9542 2018-08-15 03:23:37 After I was done getting back with her cod liver oil and talking to her again I was like wtf.
9543 2018-08-15 03:23:34 I personally have really oily hair so I try to stay away from conditioner since it kind of puts oil back in. You could try using dry shampoo or baby powder in it if you didn't want to wash as often as well
9544 2018-08-15 03:23:26 Lol no I use the oil. I put it under my tongue at night
9545 2018-08-15 03:23:19 Say what you will. I’ve been fighting anxiety since I woke up this morning. I had to take Xanax at work. Tonight it is still horrible. I took 2 Benadryl. No help. They usually relax me. Then, I put 8 drops of cbd oil under my tongue. There ya go. Ahhhhhhh. Relief.

9549 2018-08-15 03:22:56 Let's not forget, they seriously looked at moving RNH the summer they moved Hall and had they done that, it would've been a disaster. To be honest, they could still have all three at the moment & be loking to move them in the here and now. Would've been far better off.
9550 2018-08-15 03:22:46 Only an illiterate will blame notebandi for this..ruppee is down due to trade war, sanction imposed on turkey, iran..also the trade war to control on oil trade is the one reason..in ur time  it was because of the bad condition of Indian economy..and ur loot

Pepper to taste. Blend smooth.

9564 2018-08-15 03:21:12 Israel get's the majority of Iraqi oil, so, who? benefited from the war?  Does the remaining 50% of Iranian oil also go to Israel?
9565 2018-08-15 03:21:11 That the moment they had McDavid fall into their lap, 2 of the 3 were always going to be moved. The key was to move them at the right time & get full value. Chia did neither & it's cost them. I would've been fine w/ either Hall or RNH but preferred Taylor.
9566 2018-08-15 03:20:43 Would rather have a brash president telling it like it is than a smooth talking snake oil salesman! His brashness is a NYC thing He’s going to strike back if attacked & it’s not because he’s thin skinned.
9567 2018-08-15 03:20:19 I really need a good primer, transfer-proof foundation, setting powder and spray. And to get rid of my sweat and oil glands. But the first four seem easier to get . Maybe.
9568 2018-08-15 03:20:18 My mom bought us some fish oil gummies cuz we both hate the capsules and these gummies are proof that no matter what you do, you cannot mask the smell or taste of fish oil
9569 2018-08-15 03:20:16 That’s the worst! I stopped coloring my hair a few years ago because I hated the wait it feels when it’s dead  did you try a coconut oil hair mask? That’s what I use on mine to keep it healthy and it grows fast.

9571 2018-08-15 03:19:44 Crude oil was $120 per barrel. In 2014 it was less than half of $120 per barrel and still it is around $70 per barrel then why rupee is sliding?!!!

How can this be acceptable? Some kids still don’t have backpacks for school yet #changethings #yeezy
9573 2018-08-15 03:19:36 Oil companies aren't the villians here. They don't sell a product linked to lung cancer. We have already been making the transition to renewables. See around you all the solar panels on houses. My argument is we cut too deeply too soon resulting in shortages and higher prices.
9574 2018-08-15 03:19:27 Does cbd work for you? I have some oil but have only used it a handful of times bc I wasn’t a fan of how it made me feel.
9575 2018-08-15 03:19:22 'olive oil' is quite a tongue twister if you try to say it quickly over and over

9578 2018-08-15 03:19:03 Rinse with cold water on not-washing days to help with buildup (hot water made my dye fade). Also, avoid your roots when you condition since they’ll get natural oil anyway. Sometimes hair masks help too bc you get longer periods of soft hair w/o conditioner.
9579 2018-08-15 03:18:54 Thank you @BenAllenCA, @HenrySternCA for opposing corporate money & #AB84! I am disappointed in @SenatorLeyva & @hertzieLA who voted for it. AB 84 allows corporate donations of $36500 and allows Big Oil and other dirty money. #CitizensUnited #CleanMoney #CampaignFinance

9591 2018-08-15 03:16:27 Use a dry shampoo my dude. That’ll suck up all the oil but it might make it hard to style with gel after. I haven’t tried so maybe let a brotha know if it works?
9592 2018-08-15 03:15:53 Wrong fluid. Need oil. Sacrament of the sick aka "last rites"

9610 2018-08-15 03:11:44 The world uses 80-million+ barrels of oil a day.

A 5% drop in the global economy takes 4-million+ in demand off that market.

A 10% drop takes away 8-million+ in demand.

Economic warfare is fraught with peril for any oil or gas-dependent exporter.

9618 2018-08-15 03:10:20 The corporate interests de Blasio cited as foes today in context of Uber cap win were big oil and big pharma. These are not significant city-level lobbies.

9636 2018-08-15 03:08:22 But if this *is* a miscalculation, it's a remarkably core and persistent one.

Many fossil-fuel dependent aggressors seem to miss that the *tolerances* in the oil & gas market are *very* narrow & the whole thing is leaning further & further over the precipice.
9637 2018-08-15 03:07:51 I hope it is & no I am not pro oil, far from it, but I am also realistic enough to know that until we replace everything made from oil, including plastics, So unlike CON's I think we really need to up our investments in science & technology find better solutions.

9643 2018-08-15 03:07:08 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
9644 2018-08-15 03:06:53 I used coconut oil before going to sleep every two days and it worked pretty well. The usage routine and amount you put on your hair depends on the person/type of hair tho.
9645 2018-08-15 03:06:46 Trump Admin said to be ready to spend $4 million on construction projects in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in preparation for oil exploration & drilling in the nation’s biggest wildlife park.  Drilling for oil mandated in GOP tax bill  passed in December.
9646 2018-08-15 03:06:31 yes sir
9647 2018-08-15 03:06:30 Sounds like a great idea for the owners of oil and gas acreage in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, etc.
Not sure why you wouldn't like that :)
9648 2018-08-15 03:06:26 And heer is obviously a sociopath awhile is applauded by people in this industry ignores how the vast majority of the country both on the right and left see him for what he is and he's nothing more than a pathetic snake oil salesman working to be as divisive as possible.

9652 2018-08-15 03:05:48 1/2 essential oilers need to chill with the back to school propaganda: a ted talk 

Listen. I love essential oils as much as the next white lady. But don’t be sending your kids to school with some ratchet oil dunked paper towel instead of the wipes on their list.
9653 2018-08-15 03:05:24 I’m a hardcore bitch because I can put 100% peppermint essential oil directly on my skin and it feels great
9654 2018-08-15 03:05:22 Not sure, but I started giving my husband fish oil supplements (because I love him and stuff) and he's gonna end up gagging someone at work. But it's NOT me! 
9655 2018-08-15 03:05:08 I was going to to drive there today but realized my car needed an oil change and thought I’d be scared if I went by myself. But thought you may still be there. But you left so I’m glad I didn’t go
9656 2018-08-15 03:04:55 ICYMI w/all the other news...  Tax overhaul bill passed by Congress includes a provision MANDATING two oil lease sales, each offering at least 400,000 acres in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.  Trump administration pushing for an oil lease sale as early as next year.
9657 2018-08-15 03:04:47 I understand that they fear for their jobs, but so many were lost in 2014 and found their skills were useful elsewhere. Sometimes one just has to start preparing for life after the oil sands.  Kenney isn't helping, but if majority believe him.......
9658 2018-08-15 03:04:45 If we had better and more available mental health support events like this, domestic violence and kids being shot dead in school would happen far less often. When it comes to state support, why is so much given to the oil industry & military when our true needs lie elsewhere?

9667 2018-08-15 03:03:24 Well, sorry to say, you weren't being realistic. Because No. 97 is as good as he is, with a little help, he can get them to the playoffs & give them a puncher's chance but a contender is something completely different.
9668 2018-08-15 03:03:17 also grill it in some olive oil.
9669 2018-08-15 03:03:10 It really is that’s 3 bucks a sponge. Can’t beat it with a stick. I was holding off to make a big order with the foundation and oil and powder but my money is funny lol.. so I may just get the eggs first then go back when I can.

9676 2018-08-15 03:01:25 This must be why I keep seeing these ads. I'm also in NC. NO to off-shore drilling in NC or SC - our coasts are beautiful, and need to stay that way. Beach tourism is a huge industry; one spill would cripple our economies. Break the dependence on oil - invest in renewable energy!
9677 2018-08-15 03:01:09 Yes ... hope that we will outlive the effects of coal mining to change it back to clean air alternatives. Thanks, @realDonaldTrump for the severe thunderstorms your backwards thinking has caused. What’s next? Steam engine trains, trolleys and oil street lamps?

9680 2018-08-15 03:00:37 no, I know what his point is. It's disingenuous, specially when you are supporting lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist who is being boycotted and facing the consequences that come with free speech.

It has a sauce that I usually skip so I’ll just sum up the chicken part.

3 tbs olive oil
1 tbs lemon juice

9700 2018-08-15 02:58:47 Just saw a dude pay for gas but not pump gas, really heartwarming to see people support their local oil industry giants 
9701 2018-08-15 02:58:17 And you supported the Pebble Mine and more North Slope oil development.  How do you reconcile these two things and make a tweet like this? Just an accomplished lier?
9702 2018-08-15 02:58:04 I use an aloe Vera plant and Vitamin E oil .. then occasionally I will use A noxzema ani-blemish pads
9703 2018-08-15 02:57:59 I have little doubt that you have learned to cope well and by extension your kids (if you have any) and I like your use of fight as when the cheap (and criminally wasted) energy (coal and oil) run out, a little martial arts may well assist. Hope I’m wrong..

May Biore cleansing foam din pero may 2 bottles of Master facial scrub pa ako so that's what I use after
9715 2018-08-15 02:55:49 Can you give me an update please on the Australian Shipping Industry? 
I did not realise we only hold about 2 weeks of fuel and oil at any one time. 
In a time of conflict we would be in trouble because we only have foreign vessels delivering fuel :- we may not be a priority. TY
9716 2018-08-15 02:55:45 Omg yes!!! I get so annoyed when she says oil
9717 2018-08-15 02:55:02 Not that I know of other than Lush at the Lush at the moment, but I think we can expect some of our local innovators to come up with something. I get an amazing bentonite clay, coconut & essential oil deodorant for 20$that lasts a year and it works!!!

9722 2018-08-15 02:54:30 But, Hillary is history.  Current POTUS is the one 100% guilty that we're concerned about now. Wake up, get sober Trump punch drunk!  Punch = diarrhea (BS) + snake oil (manipulation) to achieve DELUSIONAL world!
9723 2018-08-15 02:54:27 Have you looked in nopoo? It’s a movement to stop using shampoo entirely (in your case use it only after bleaching). It takes time but eventually makes your hair really soft by essentially oil training your hair
9724 2018-08-15 02:54:25 Oily hair like yours need to be washed more often because they produce its oil faster than others
9725 2018-08-15 02:53:55 Whatever I'm going to trust my government before I trust you. What s it matter though? 15 of the 911,terrorists came from saudi Arabia. That's the point but you have oil so trump likes you and hold hands. Strange custom but I'm not judging.

9732 2018-08-15 02:53:00 They took a decentralized open-source project built on inclusivity, and forked it so that they could try to make some money(?) by peddling Infowars hate videos & snake oil.

9738 2018-08-15 02:52:35 I'm withholding judgment.

*Not* because it's impossible, but because the blowout in oil prices has decimated Russia's economy. Gore helped.

But we're in the midst of a coup in which conspirators call other conspirators they *know* are under warrant, to yap about treason.
9739 2018-08-15 02:52:34 I’m about to reorder mct oil. I just bought Vitamin Shoppe brand last time. Do you use the powder? Is there a certain band you like? They’re all different. And how about the vanilla flavored ones? Yay or nay? Thx

9744 2018-08-15 02:51:12 There is no “cult” that promotes oil. It is used because it is the best; selected by the “invisible hand “ of capitalism.  Capitalism is the natural commerce of free men.  Only when government control becomes excessive does “chrony capitalism “ emerge.
9745 2018-08-15 02:51:01 1 month without oil and Canada would count the dead by the 10s of millions. 2 months it would be empty except for corpses. 1 week in the major cities would be war zones. Be happy we have the blood of civilization bleeding from the planet. A miracle.

9765 2018-08-15 02:48:35 forget about dravidians..they do it for politics.I see widespread brahmin pride, when tambrahmins achieve something, it is seen as brahmin achievement, rather than hindu achievement.

9778 2018-08-15 02:46:35 It's only bad for it if it isnt properly maintained. Regular oil changes and check ups and they should run idle for as long as you want....or until it runs out of gas.

9810 2018-08-15 02:42:22 I didn't realize that the oil wife life uncensored's YouTube channel and Twitter got deleted by herself. Because some self-centered woman apparently threatened her with someone that was abusive to her (based on tweets I saw). Like it's genuinely sad cause I liked OWL's videos.
9811 2018-08-15 02:42:14 There are no other realistic options. We aren’t trading a dman, forwards of value are needed and be better not trade night picks or top prospects.  The LTIR relief goes away when Sekera is activated as well which limits ability to spend the relief.
9812 2018-08-15 02:41:56 What is this? Meat is healthy to eat.. Rice is purely starch so better to avoid it. Anything deep fried esp in seed oil causes inflammation in the body so not recommended.

9915 2018-08-15 02:28:37 Food blog/recipe video rant: who the hell puts veggies on a sheet to roast and THEN puts olive oil and seasoning on them?  Put in on in the bowl. More complete and even coverage. Thanks for listening.

9921 2018-08-15 02:28:10 I always grab some olives, roasted garlic, sun roasted tomatoes in olive oil, and those grape leaf rolls from that buffet in the deli section when I go grocery shopping. Just enough for a snack.
9922 2018-08-15 02:28:04 Yes...the care,oil& meds vs. surgery 
9923 2018-08-15 02:27:59 Left my weed in my console while I was getting an oil change and the motherfuckers took well over an eighth. I was fucking fuming.
9924 2018-08-15 02:27:55 Make this snake oil salesman buffoon go away. 
9925 2018-08-15 02:27:12 What a confidence trick ... selling a made up cure for a made up illness

The very definition of snake oil

Why do christians need saving from their own god ?
9926 2018-08-15 02:27:11 (Though on that, part of the problems since then, among other things, was that dependence on oil money, the world oil prices went down, so any country dependent on it found themselves a bit short on cash (same has happened with Russia)

9929 2018-08-15 02:26:52 Current mayor status:

I have mines choking my city with pollution, there's no school, I'm losing money despite trade deals, my nuclear power plat had a meltdown and is on the verge of a second, and I can't get oil to my other plant

Don't vote for me, folks
9930 2018-08-15 02:26:47 On the bright side, someone put a plastic-sealed canvas in a trash bin so I got to take that home after a light washing. I still remember a little about oil painting from high school.

9933 2018-08-15 02:26:20 Yes, but refused to pay extra for them.
Oh hell yes. I negotiate for a living. I got free, lifetime, valet, oil changes. 
I don't really know. I'm more of a motorcycle guy than a car guy. The clear, plastic film?
9934 2018-08-15 02:26:19 Time for another Republican president to bust up big monopolies, like Teddy Roosevelt did to Standard Oil. Break up Google, Amazon, Facebook and Twitter - for starters.

9936 2018-08-15 02:25:45 Hydrating vs moisturizing
•hydrator: provides water
•moisturizing: provides oil. 

Dry skin: lacks of oil
Oily skin: lacks of oil
Dehydrated skin: lacks of water

Footnote: oily skin can be dehydrated too.
9937 2018-08-15 02:25:40 I can make you some oil up.. or just tell you what i use... and divorce helpnis help with women... and im no help at all with them... unless making them mad and leave is the goal... then thats just nature i think

9946 2018-08-15 02:23:42 High THC oil > high CBD oil in most cases ...
9947 2018-08-15 02:23:42 Why use all of that oil from saudi arabia to fly to BC
9948 2018-08-15 02:23:38 I have heard about this happening a lot out west in Alberta’s smaller cities not enough work in the oil field so it all trickles down and with minimum wage going up more people will get layed off or hours cut people working 3 jobs now so gov says they created

9957 2018-08-15 02:22:18 The real enemy is the oligopoly lockdown of tax dollars toward coal, oil & gas which is killing our planet & our future. Level the playing field for clean alternatives & act like real Republicans for a change. Release Energy investment $ into free market economy & competition
9958 2018-08-15 02:22:02 This really burns my butt. In oil rich Alberta 
9959 2018-08-15 02:21:56 egg.... we have egg.... maybe if i just scramble it to avoid too much oil
9960 2018-08-15 02:21:39 usas algún oil o algo? Yo puedo estar horas en la playa y nada de nada :(
9961 2018-08-15 02:21:32 I had had to get some oil for my pen
9962 2018-08-15 02:21:29 Sure, unless the Dems decide to do something stupid like reverse the ban on taking money from Big Oil...oh, wait
9963 2018-08-15 02:21:24 Okay. But if you don't believe in enforcing equality in any forceful way, how do you propose we fix poverty and lack of access to healthcare? Or do you think it's acceptable that people die of treatable diseases merely because they lacked the opportunities to become an oil baron?
9964 2018-08-15 02:21:21 Oil to loosen the glue and warm to hot water , if you can stand it and not burn your eye makeup remover /face cleanser gets it off fast.
When I wear lashes I use the actual lash glue and not hair glue so it’s really easy to take off

9969 2018-08-15 02:21:11 He's not even my bias wtf
9970 2018-08-15 02:21:09 You really are slow to understand things. Let me try again. You initially claimed to know why Venezuela is in a deep hole saying it was because of the drop in the price of oil which is completely false. If that was true, Venezuela would have descended to that hole in the 80s ...
9971 2018-08-15 02:21:03 Oxy bagus,  clean up,  tea tree oil juga bagus

9974 2018-08-15 02:20:07 I have to agree with @AndrewScheer on this one, we should be self sufficient when it comes to oil and then sell the rest on the global market. #cdnpoli #nlpoli
9975 2018-08-15 02:20:06 There are two, ya dork: oil and eggs
9976 2018-08-15 02:19:54 It took #obama 12 days to visit the Gulf of Mexico after the BP oil spill. He was to busy with fundraisers and talking basketball w Marv Albert. (He definitely wasn't creating jobs)
9977 2018-08-15 02:19:31 I like two salad dressings. Wishbone Italian, oil & red wine vinegar. The others taste 'too' for me.
9978 2018-08-15 02:19:29 "What is your position on drilling on ANWR?" 

Galvin says oil and gas is important but that's gotta change. Believes in the process before any development happens. 

Shein says ANWR will create some jobs but we need to get away from fossil fuels.

9994 2018-08-15 02:17:17 Not completely true. Even adjusting for oil, rupee has done well. The real issue is dollar strength. Look at the rupee wrt to other currencies and it has gained substantial ground.
